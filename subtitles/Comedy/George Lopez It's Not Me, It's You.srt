1
00:00:06,634 --> 00:00:09,569
<i>Is it possible to be allergic to human contact?</i>

2
00:00:09,569 --> 00:00:11,670
<i>Min Kyu had been hurt...</i>

3
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,000
<i>by betrayal of those he trusted.</i>

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,569
<i>It's difficult to cure it.</i>

5
00:00:15,569 --> 00:00:17,540
<i>I'm completely healed.</i>

6
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:19,310
<i>He's cured by Ji A.</i>

7
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,650
<i>It's because you were by my side.</i>

8
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:23,209
<i>His allergy gets cured.</i>

9
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:24,720
<i>This is the moment...</i>

10
00:00:25,819 --> 00:00:27,479
<i>to kiss.</i>

11
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:30,819
<i>What if he finds out that I'm not a robot?</i>

12
00:00:30,819 --> 00:00:33,960
<i>Ji A starts to fall in love with Min Kyu.</i>

13
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,290
<i>You wouldn't lie to me.</i>

14
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:37,430
<i>You knew that he was allergic to human contact,</i>

15
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:39,099
<i>but you still sent me to his house.</i>

16
00:00:39,099 --> 00:00:41,570
<i>While pretending to be a robot,</i>

17
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:44,199
<i>Ji A is afraid that Min Kyu will feel betrayed.</i>

18
00:00:44,199 --> 00:00:45,540
<i>I fell in love with her.</i>

19
00:00:46,169 --> 00:00:47,599
<i>I love...</i>

20
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,309
<i>Aji 3.</i>

21
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,140
<i>I do.</i>

22
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,379
<i>I should be honest before it's too late.</i>

23
00:00:54,379 --> 00:00:56,710
<i>She decides to tell him the truth.</i>

24
00:00:57,409 --> 00:00:58,419
<i>You must not tell him.</i>

25
00:00:58,419 --> 00:01:00,620
<i>However, Doctor Oh says that...</i>

26
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:03,120
<i>Min Kyu might die if he finds out the truth.</i>

27
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,559
<i>You should not tell him.</i>

28
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,990
<i>Let's reset Aji 3.</i>

29
00:01:07,219 --> 00:01:10,460
<i>Every moment I spent with you was a miracle.</i>

30
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:11,460
<i>Thank you.</i>

31
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,969
<i>In the end, they say goodbye while hiding the truth.</i>

32
00:01:15,969 --> 00:01:17,100
<i>I love you.</i>

33
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,669
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

34
00:01:24,909 --> 00:01:26,738
(Episode 21)

35
00:01:27,949 --> 00:01:29,850
What do you think of this design?

36
00:01:59,279 --> 00:02:00,339
I think...

37
00:02:01,309 --> 00:02:03,180
there's something we should discuss.

38
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,020
Shall I start?

39
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:13,020
I like apple tea at this cafe.

40
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,789
I prefer hydrangea to roses.

41
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,330
I prefer winter to summer.

42
00:02:23,469 --> 00:02:25,700
I thought I knew myself well,

43
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,569
but I was wrong.

44
00:02:30,309 --> 00:02:31,509
As we meet people...

45
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:35,779
and go through experiences,

46
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,779
we learn about our real selves.

47
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:43,120
I agree.

48
00:02:43,219 --> 00:02:45,890
I'm not as materialistic as I thought.

49
00:02:47,289 --> 00:02:49,230
I'm surprised myself.

50
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:54,059
Since it's a part of me, I should accept it.

51
00:02:55,569 --> 00:02:56,569
That's why...

52
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:01,240
I can't be with you, Min Kyu.

53
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:06,980
You're impressive.

54
00:03:08,409 --> 00:03:09,480
Ri El.

55
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:14,219
I'll talk to my dad when the time is right.

56
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,520
He'll stay supportive of you as usual.

57
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,689
He acknowledges you're good at your job.

58
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,689
The problem is me.

59
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:26,460
It's my first time going against my dad, so it won't be easy,

60
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,270
but he won't throw me out.

61
00:03:28,999 --> 00:03:31,700
Use me as an excuse.

62
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,240
No thanks.

63
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:36,909
It's something I must do at least once in my life.

64
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:40,939
There's just one thing I feel guilty about.

65
00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:45,480
The birthday cards you got over the past 15 years.

66
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,189
They weren't from me.

67
00:03:50,849 --> 00:03:53,289
Sorry. My dad went too far.

68
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,759
You knew?

69
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,860
Whether they were from you or not,

70
00:04:03,529 --> 00:04:06,240
the moment I opened them,

71
00:04:07,939 --> 00:04:09,640
I was really happy.

72
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:13,379
For that happiness,

73
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:17,480
I thank you.

74
00:04:18,379 --> 00:04:19,749
We're saying goodbye.

75
00:04:19,749 --> 00:04:22,590
Don't be so nice or I'll regret letting you go.

76
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:26,360
You've changed a bit.

77
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,189
How so?

78
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:31,459
Before, when I sat across from you,

79
00:04:31,829 --> 00:04:34,730
I'd wonder what we should talk about.

80
00:04:35,069 --> 00:04:38,600
Now, I'd like to have a drink with you.

81
00:04:41,069 --> 00:04:44,910
If you want to have a drink, call me at any time.

82
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:51,420
It's a pity I won't get that necklace of yours.

83
00:04:52,149 --> 00:04:54,249
It'll find a good owner.

84
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:02,290
(Seoul Station, Entrance, Exit, Let's go on a trip with KTX.)

85
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:04,090
Did you arrive?

86
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,559
Yes, I'm in Daegu right now.

87
00:05:05,559 --> 00:05:08,030
The agreement ceremony is going well as planned.

88
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,329
Why aren't you driving here?

89
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:13,499
I thought it'd be a good idea to get some fresh air...

90
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,209
and travel along with other people.

91
00:05:17,509 --> 00:05:20,280
You don't need to pick me up at the station. I'll see you at the center.

92
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:24,680
A meteor shower occurs when dust from comets or asteroids...

93
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,350
collide with the Earth's atmosphere and burn.

94
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:29,749
It's a phenomenon where shooting stars fall like rain,

95
00:05:29,749 --> 00:05:32,019
which makes them seem like rain.

96
00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:34,790
The meteor shower that's been observed...

97
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:37,590
occurred due to an asteroid that got sucked into...

98
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:41,430
the Earth's atmosphere and burned up.

99
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:44,999
Since it was identified in 1983, this asteroid will move...

100
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:49,809
Hi, Hong Joo.

101
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,480
I'm about to board the train.

102
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,809
I'll call when I reach Geoje Island.

103
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,480
Bye.

104
00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:02,590
Hi, Sun Hye.

105
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,920
I'm about to board the train.

106
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,790
I'm not leaving the country.

107
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,959
Why is everyone calling me?

108
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:13,030
Hang up. I'll call when I get there.

109
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,360
Bye.

110
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,209
We... We're here for coffee.

111
00:06:22,209 --> 00:06:24,110
- Get out. - Yes, sir.

112
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,610
Sun Hye.

113
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:30,050
How is Ji A doing?

114
00:06:30,949 --> 00:06:32,879
Is she eating?

115
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,519
How many coffees?

116
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:40,160
Seven. We're expecting a guest at the lab.

117
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,259
Seven. It's a lucky number, so it's a deal.

118
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,559
It's a deal.

119
00:06:49,499 --> 00:06:51,370
Is Min Kyu okay?

120
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,999
- Would he be? - Would he be?

121
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,670
He withers away each day.

122
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,240
Noticeably.

123
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:02,209
They won't cross paths or something, would they?

124
00:07:02,209 --> 00:07:05,180
Ji A will spend a while on Geoje Island...

125
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,220
and then she'll go to Australia.

126
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:10,689
They'll never meet until the sky breaks in two.

127
00:07:10,689 --> 00:07:13,120
But still, what if they do meet?

128
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:16,329
Then...

129
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,259
they're destined to cause the sky to split.

130
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,419
(To Dongdaegu)

131
00:09:05,499 --> 00:09:08,710
We will soon arrive in Dongdaegu.

132
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:12,179
The door will open on your right. Thank you.

133
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:26,389
Excuse me. You're in our seat.

134
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,499
(Australia)

135
00:10:13,669 --> 00:10:15,169
What a relief.

136
00:10:30,789 --> 00:10:31,889
What?

137
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,460
Aji 3's face.

138
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,570
How did you come up with it?

139
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,310
I had a character model.

140
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,749
With the face, personality, habits, and so on.

141
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:59,580
I hired someone appropriate as a part-time worker.

142
00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:02,490
I can't reach that person now.

143
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:03,990
Why?

144
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,659
Why would you suddenly ask me that?

145
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:13,659
I just suddenly got curious.

146
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,330
Then...

147
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:19,039
one day...

148
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:21,100
could I...

149
00:11:22,539 --> 00:11:25,679
cross paths with that person?

150
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:29,850
That would be possible.

151
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,149
But even if you do,

152
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:35,649
it would be best if you just ignore her.

153
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:39,690
You could end up looking like a really strange guy.

154
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:45,399
Okay. I'll do that.

155
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,580
The number you called does not exist.

156
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,919
I really can't reach her.

157
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:31,240
How are you doing,

158
00:12:32,009 --> 00:12:33,240
Doctor Hong?

159
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:35,980
Hello.

160
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:53,730
Yes, hi, Mr. Jo.

161
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:59,299
I... Something came up and I can't make it.

162
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,870
What happened? Is it serious?

163
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:08,580
Yes, it's... I'm not exactly in my right mind.

164
00:13:09,409 --> 00:13:10,509
Director Kim.

165
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:11,950
Director Kim.

166
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:13,620
Are you okay?

167
00:13:13,749 --> 00:13:16,350
Yes. Please take care of the ceremony for me.

168
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,450
Who's this woman?

169
00:13:48,149 --> 00:13:50,149
She's Aji 3.

170
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:52,320
Are you saying...

171
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,090
- she's a robot? - Yes.

172
00:13:55,659 --> 00:13:58,529
Her hairstyle is different because she changed wigs.

173
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,200
I saw her going to work from...

174
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,600
Mr. Jo's...

175
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,269
We saw her going to work from Mr. Jo's house.

176
00:14:10,669 --> 00:14:12,139
And you mentioned that...

177
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:15,679
you saw Aji 3 eating ice cream.

178
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:19,950
Yes, it's an incredibly high-tech robot.

179
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,649
Isn't this enough information...

180
00:14:23,789 --> 00:14:26,019
for us to get paid?

181
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:30,259
Is she Aji 3?

182
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,200
No, wait.

183
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,100
Or could she actually be human?

184
00:14:41,769 --> 00:14:42,769
Her?

185
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,409
We used her as a model for Aji 3.

186
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,480
We used an actual human as a model...

187
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,480
so that we could make Aji 3 look very realistic.

188
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,950
So are you saying she was used as a model for making Aji 3?

189
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,159
Is there...

190
00:14:58,590 --> 00:14:59,690
a problem with that?

191
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:01,259
No.

192
00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:03,060
But...

193
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:06,399
which one did Director Kim meet?

194
00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:10,399
Was it Aji 3 or this woman?

195
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:15,470
I don't understand what you mean.

196
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:17,409
I'm pretty sure you do.

197
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,009
If you don't have anything else to say,

198
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:21,649
I'll excuse myself.

199
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,519
You'll...

200
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,080
soon have something to say to me.

201
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:31,659
Give me a call anytime.

202
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,120
Sure.

00:15:57,919 --> 00:15:59,620

205
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,120
(The password is incorrect.)

206
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,490
Ssanip, did you create this folder?

207
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:11,360
- No, it wasn't me. - You little...

208
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:15,870
Look at this.

209
00:16:16,429 --> 00:16:20,470
I think it was made to save files that were soon to be deleted.

210
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:21,570
Then Hoktal must've made this.

211
00:16:22,169 --> 00:16:24,409
It's eating up a lot of space, so tell him to get rid of it.

212
00:16:24,409 --> 00:16:25,480
Okay.

213
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,980
By the way, when's the Design Team coming?

214
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:31,249
Mr. Jo told us that they'd be here today.

215
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,649
They need to measure all our devices in advance...

216
00:16:33,649 --> 00:16:36,749
so that they can set them up in our new laboratory.

217
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:39,060
Who is it?

218
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,960
We're the Design Team from KM Financial.

219
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,789
They're here. Just a moment.

220
00:16:42,789 --> 00:16:45,200
They're here. They're finally here.

221
00:16:46,999 --> 00:16:49,100
Hello. Hello.

222
00:16:50,429 --> 00:16:51,539
Come in.

223
00:16:51,669 --> 00:16:52,970
Hello.

224
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,419
You came here a lot earlier than expected.

225
00:17:08,419 --> 00:17:10,290
We got things done pretty quickly.

226
00:17:11,159 --> 00:17:12,159
Do you need any help?

227
00:17:12,159 --> 00:17:14,120
It's okay. We're professionals.

228
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,189
Okay.

229
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:18,459
I don't think you're leveling it properly. Let me help you.

230
00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:20,530
- No, I'm really... I'm fine. - It's okay.

231
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:22,530
Don't mind me. I like doing stuff like this.

232
00:17:23,929 --> 00:17:25,699
Do you need help with anything else?

233
00:17:25,699 --> 00:17:27,600
- No, it's okay. - Okay.

234
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:31,439
- It's bent. - Where?

235
00:17:31,439 --> 00:17:33,310
- Oh, I see. - This should be measured properly.

236
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,709
- I'll hold it. - Okay.

237
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,179
- You're good. - Thank you.

238
00:17:41,389 --> 00:17:43,149
Who are you?

239
00:17:44,219 --> 00:17:46,689
Aji 3.

240
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,889
Do you know me?

241
00:17:49,929 --> 00:17:51,899
I'd like to get to know you as well.

242
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:16,790
I won't allow you to look at her like that.

243
00:18:16,949 --> 00:18:18,860
And you must refrain from touching her.

244
00:18:19,659 --> 00:18:22,729
She's really sensitive.

245
00:18:28,199 --> 00:18:30,229
How should I block your eyes?

246
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:34,469
Hoktal, come here, and check this.

247
00:18:34,469 --> 00:18:36,310
Okay. Excuse me.

248
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:48,649
Let's see.

249
00:18:50,219 --> 00:18:53,520
It's done. They installed the virus. Okay. Let's hack the files.

250
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,830
Figure out the password.

251
00:19:00,959 --> 00:19:01,969
We've succeeded.

252
00:19:44,139 --> 00:19:45,979
- Thank you. - Thank you.

(Hong Joo's Place)

254
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,929
She should be here by now.

255
00:20:02,429 --> 00:20:03,560
Just...

256
00:20:04,459 --> 00:20:06,560
let her do whatever she wants.

257
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,870
Don't ask her any questions.

258
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:12,199
Give her food if she says she's hungry.

259
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,870
And let her work if she insists on helping you out.

260
00:20:15,409 --> 00:20:17,070
I understand what you mean.

261
00:20:18,139 --> 00:20:20,979
Speak of the devil. She's here. I'm going to hang up now.

262
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:23,709
Ma'am.

263
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,479
Let me take a look at you.

264
00:20:26,979 --> 00:20:29,550
My gosh, you've lost so much weight.

265
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:31,790
I went on a diet. I've become really pretty, haven't I?

266
00:20:31,989 --> 00:20:34,389
I'm worried that I might become even prettier.

267
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:37,689
I personally think my granddaughter, Hong Joo, is prettier.

268
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:42,169
You should be grateful that you have such a kind sister-in-law.

269
00:20:42,169 --> 00:20:44,330
My gosh, you don't know what you're talking about.

270
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:47,600
She becomes really scary when she gets mad.

271
00:20:47,739 --> 00:20:50,540
That's why no one can say a word to her when she's angry.

272
00:20:50,639 --> 00:20:53,040
She's like that because she takes after me.

273
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,649
My gosh, enough of that.

274
00:20:55,449 --> 00:20:56,850
Here. I got you a gift.

275

My goodness, you didn't have to waste your money like this.

276
00:20:59,649 --> 00:21:01,790
I bought it myself, so don't think of it as a waste.

277
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:04,050
Just focus on using it until the last drop.

- Why are you wearing that? - I need to work.

279
00:21:09,489 --> 00:21:11,600
Gosh, you just got here.

280
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,699
Are you trying not to pay me? I'm going to make sure I get paid today.

281
00:21:14,729 --> 00:21:17,770
Since when did you become so crazy about earning money?

282

I hired someone appropriate as a part-time worker.

Hey, Captain Park.

290
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,899
You should be bringing me the fish you caught. Why are you calling?

291

Come on. Please deliver them for me.

Is the ship coming in?

295
00:22:00,479 --> 00:22:01,510
Yes.

Some customers made a reservation for tomorrow.

297
00:22:03,479 --> 00:22:05,679

00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,850
- But that old man... - I'll go get them.

299

I'll be right back.

No, I'm going to Australia.

You're so smart and talented.

00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:00,500
- Hurry up. - Hello.

332
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,000
Oh, you're here.

333
00:24:04,429 --> 00:24:07,100
- Gosh. - I brought your favorite bread.

334
00:24:07,199 --> 00:24:08,939
Enjoy it as a snack.

335
00:24:08,939 --> 00:24:12,139
You always bring it when you visit. That's nice.

336
00:24:12,139 --> 00:24:14,280
Then please give me the top quality fish.

337
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,550
Okay.

338
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:18,620
I already picked out the ones for you.

339
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,820
Bring them here.

340
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,320
- You're the best, Captain. - I know.

341
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,320
Bring them here.

342
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,760
Goodness, they're a bit heavy.

343
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,530
- Here you go. Take them. - Thank you.

344
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:30,629
It's heavy.

345
00:24:30,629 --> 00:24:32,729
- Okay. - Thank you for the bread.

346
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,330
Thank you.

347
00:24:45,879 --> 00:24:46,909
Goodbye.

348
00:24:46,909 --> 00:24:49,050
- Take care. - Bye.

349
00:24:49,979 --> 00:24:51,979
Please follow her.

350
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,889
Grandma.

351
00:25:46,469 --> 00:25:48,169
- Thank you. - Enjoy.

352
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:04,389
You know me, don't you?

353
00:26:11,429 --> 00:26:12,500
No.

354
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,800
I don't know you.

355
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:22,340
We...

356
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:26,340
were on the same train.

357
00:26:27,979 --> 00:26:31,219
Oh, that's right.

358
00:26:31,219 --> 00:26:36,189
Our seats were facing each other.

359
00:26:36,449 --> 00:26:38,489
I remember that,

360
00:26:38,489 --> 00:26:40,760
but what about it?

361
00:26:41,489 --> 00:26:45,459
Could you spare me some time?

362
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:47,600
Why?

363
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,500
I have something to tell you.

364
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,070
About what?

365
00:26:54,469 --> 00:26:55,639
I...

366
00:26:58,479 --> 00:26:59,909
I'm sorry,

367
00:27:00,239 --> 00:27:02,550
but I don't have much time.

368
00:27:02,709 --> 00:27:04,580
I work here as a part-timer.

369
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:07,889
As you can see, we're very busy.

370
00:27:07,989 --> 00:27:11,219
If my boss catches me chitchatting with you,

371
00:27:11,219 --> 00:27:13,659
I lose my pay for the day.

372
00:27:14,189 --> 00:27:16,729
I'll wait until you finish.

373
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,729
Sun Hye, he's here. What should I do?

374
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:01,709
Gosh, he really did split the sky in half.

375
00:28:01,709 --> 00:28:03,209
- What? - Never mind.

376
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:05,540
What is he doing now?

377
00:28:08,409 --> 00:28:11,850
I'm in the kitchen, and he won't get up from his seat.

378
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:14,120
I'm about to suffocate. What should I do?

379
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,850
Breathe in.

380
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:19,389
Breathe in and out. Listen carefully.

381
00:28:19,389 --> 00:28:21,560
You've never met Min Kyu before.

382
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:24,860
What do we do when a stranger approaches us?

383
00:28:24,959 --> 00:28:27,459
- We ignore him. - That's right.

384
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:30,129
What if he's persistent?

385
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,239
Treat him like a crazy man.

386
00:28:34,439 --> 00:28:37,270
- Let's go. - Thank you for the food.

387
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:39,040
Come again soon.

388
00:29:21,189 --> 00:29:24,820
I know that I sat across from you,

389
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:27,929
but it's strange that you followed me here.

390
00:29:27,929 --> 00:29:30,360
Do you know that it's not normal?

391
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:34,600
Based on your expression, it wasn't by chance.

392
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:37,530
Did you follow me from the train station?

393
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:41,100
Did you fall in love with me at first sight?

394
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:43,669
Even if you did,

395
00:29:43,669 --> 00:29:45,080
unless you're a stalker,

396
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,209
you can't follow me to my work.

397
00:29:47,209 --> 00:29:49,379
That's just wrong.

398
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:52,820
I have no interest in you.

399
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:54,750
You aren't even my type.

400
00:29:54,949 --> 00:29:56,820
Please leave.

401
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,260
Otherwise, I'll call the police.

402
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,600
Assorted sashimi set.

403
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:09,229
Won't you leave?

404
00:30:09,229 --> 00:30:11,600
I'm quite hungry.

405
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,100
This isn't the only sashimi restaurant.

406
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:17,270
This is the restaurant where I want to eat at.

407
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:19,810
By the way,

408
00:30:20,409 --> 00:30:24,550
is your name Hong Joo?

409
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:26,020
(Hong Joo's)

410
00:30:27,449 --> 00:30:28,520
Goodness.

411
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,350
Hong Joo?

412
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:32,659
I'll wait for you, Hong Joo.

413
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,530
Who is he?

414
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:39,330
I don't know him.

415
00:30:39,429 --> 00:30:40,600
Should I call the police?

416
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,699
No.

417
00:30:41,929 --> 00:30:44,600
Isn't he bothering you?

418
00:30:49,409 --> 00:30:50,570
It's me...

419
00:30:51,439 --> 00:30:53,110
who's bothering him.

420
00:30:53,939 --> 00:30:56,949
I see. That must be him.

421
00:30:57,050 --> 00:31:00,280
The reason why you're working here barely eating.

422
00:31:10,989 --> 00:31:12,800
(Hong Baek Gyoon)

423
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:18,699
The number you have dialed is not available.

424
00:31:18,699 --> 00:31:19,800
Please leave a message...

425
00:31:20,969 --> 00:31:23,270
It's Ji A. I'm in Geoje Island.

426
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:25,110
Min Kyu is here.

427
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:27,739
He hasn't found out, but what should I do?

428
00:31:27,739 --> 00:31:31,379
(He hasn't found out, but what should I do?)

429
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,919
Pai, analyze the virus pattern to cure it.

430
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:38,989
Hoktal, trace back where it came from.

431
00:31:38,989 --> 00:31:41,060
Ssanip, see if any files were taken.

432
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,360
- Yes, doctor. - Yes, doctor.

433
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,459
Who dared to infect...

434
00:31:44,459 --> 00:31:46,699
our main motherboard with a virus?

435
00:31:46,699 --> 00:31:47,929
When was it created?

436
00:31:47,929 --> 00:31:49,000
It's today.

437
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,729
It's either exterior or interior.

438
00:31:50,899 --> 00:31:52,639
Was there anyone else here today?

439
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,770
- The planning team? - The planning team?

440
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:56,810
Darn it. Look through every detail.

441
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:58,479
Every file is on Aji 3 technology.

442
00:31:58,479 --> 00:31:59,540
Protect it no matter what.

443
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:00,679
- Yes, doctor. - Yes, doctor.

444
00:32:14,889 --> 00:32:16,530
I got it.

445
00:32:16,689 --> 00:32:19,459
I traced it back. It was sent from Yongsan.

446
00:32:19,459 --> 00:32:21,600
Destroy everything that you find as you trace back.

447
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,669
Okay.

448
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:24,399
How dare you?

449
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:28,070
Go mess with yourselves, scums.

450
00:32:29,709 --> 00:32:31,580
Gosh, I give up.

451
00:32:32,239 --> 00:32:33,909
Where are you going?

452
00:32:37,479 --> 00:32:40,050
Who are these guys?

453
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:42,189
See if anything was stolen from the backup files.

454
00:32:42,189 --> 00:32:43,689
I checked everything.

455
00:32:43,689 --> 00:32:45,459
Perfectly cleared.

456
00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:46,959
Okay.

457
00:32:48,489 --> 00:32:50,489
Someone claimed to be Mr. Jo...

458
00:32:50,489 --> 00:32:52,459
and postponed the planning team's visit.

459
00:32:52,459 --> 00:32:55,870
They hired hackers to attack us.

460
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:57,030
- Who was it? - Who?

461
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:58,600
I know who it was.

462
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,439
What? Who was it?

463
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:08,780
Even now,

464
00:33:09,209 --> 00:33:10,879
whatever your father does...

465
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,780
you'll turn a blind eye.

466
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:16,050
So keep doing what you always did,

467
00:33:16,389 --> 00:33:18,919
and stand aside as if you don't care.

468
00:33:25,429 --> 00:33:26,459
Why are you here?

469
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,770
Why do you think? I came to drink with you.

470
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,169
Are you pitying me?

471
00:33:35,439 --> 00:33:37,370
You must not know me yet.

472
00:33:37,739 --> 00:33:39,340
I'm not good at pitying people.

473
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:43,209
Please just leave.

474
00:33:43,209 --> 00:33:44,310
CEO Hwang.

475
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,320
You must be here...

476
00:33:47,949 --> 00:33:48,989
to make fun of me.

477
00:33:53,189 --> 00:33:54,959
You're so twisted.

478
00:33:55,489 --> 00:33:58,030
Let's see how childish I can be.

479
00:34:00,229 --> 00:34:02,229
And let's see how materialistic you can be.

480
00:34:02,969 --> 00:34:04,669
Let's keep this up.

481
00:34:04,669 --> 00:34:06,899
I'm curious to know how we'll end up at this rate.

482
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:09,409
That's enough.

483
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:12,279
If you keep going, you're going to hurt my pride.

484
00:34:12,279 --> 00:34:14,339
If I succeed in ruining Min Kyu's career,

485
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:18,319
your dad will eventually give you to me.

486
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:19,779
Yoo Cheol.

487
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:23,650
Are you really going to talk as if I'm an object?

488
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:25,560
Why is it okay for Min Kyu...

489
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,790
but not for me?

490
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:31,929
What's so different about him?

491
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:34,400
Do you really want to know?

492
00:34:34,969 --> 00:34:36,230
Min Kyu...

493
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:38,799
never gives up on being a gentleman.

494
00:34:39,069 --> 00:34:42,210
He doesn't stoop low and show his worst side like you.

495
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:48,210
Ri El.

496
00:34:53,819 --> 00:34:55,989
If Director Kim becomes your son-in-law,

497
00:34:56,319 --> 00:34:58,960
it'll only be right for you to take charge.

498
00:35:01,089 --> 00:35:03,790
- Please go first. - Okay.

499
00:35:13,799 --> 00:35:15,370
Did you meet Min Kyu?

500
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,980
I met Yoo Cheol.

501
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,420
His dad's the chairman.

502
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:27,150
Why did he get kicked out?

503
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:29,049
Because Chairman Hwang tried to...

504
00:35:29,319 --> 00:35:32,020
get rid of Min Kyu and make Yoo Cheol the director.

505
00:35:32,659 --> 00:35:35,489
He probably got a lot of bribes in that process.

506
00:35:37,029 --> 00:35:38,859
And I'm sure he used that money to buy borrowed accounts.

507
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:41,060
But that's solely on his dad.

508
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:42,799
Yoo Cheol did nothing wrong.

509
00:35:42,799 --> 00:35:46,299
He was the CEO, but he knew nothing. That's what he did wrong.

510
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,239
It's neither fair nor transparent.

511
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:51,040
I really don't like it.

512
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:53,679
Min Kyu's always fair and transparent.

513
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:55,750
I can't kiss him, Dad.

514
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:02,190
I changed your engagement venue to a bigger place.

515
00:36:02,389 --> 00:36:03,920
We're going to have a lot of guests.

516
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:05,659
Are you going to use...

517
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,190
my engagement day to become the chairman of KM Financial?

518
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:10,159
Instead, you'll get to become the director's wife.

519
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,569
We failed.

520
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,139
I'm sorry, sir.

521
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:35,989
Who are you? Let's get ready.

522
00:36:37,049 --> 00:36:38,120
Combine.

523
00:36:47,799 --> 00:36:51,440
Fight. Fight.

524
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:56,969
- I'm going to destroy you. - Hey, kid. Look at me for a second.

525
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:05,350
(Hong Joo's)

526
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:22,569
I don't know what's going on,

527
00:37:22,929 --> 00:37:25,699
but you shouldn't make him wait for too long.

528
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,159
What is it that you want to say?

529
00:37:56,791 --> 00:37:59,974
(Episode 22 will air shortly.)
