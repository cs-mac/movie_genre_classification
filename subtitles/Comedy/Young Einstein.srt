1
00:02:09,341 --> 00:02:13,437
Tasmania, it was just about
the best place to grow up.

2
00:02:14,246 --> 00:02:16,646
Thousands of miles of wilderness.

3
00:02:17,315 --> 00:02:20,682
And right in the middle of it all
was our apple farm.

4
00:02:34,633 --> 00:02:37,568
As exciting as life was on our apple farm...

5
00:02:37,969 --> 00:02:41,029
I still had plenty of time to listen to music.

6
00:02:41,907 --> 00:02:44,933
And to think about the universe.

7
00:02:55,087 --> 00:02:56,748
Mom loved cooking.

8
00:02:57,322 --> 00:03:01,383
She'd spend most of her time
baking huge apple pies.

9
00:03:06,098 --> 00:03:08,123
Dad was a man of the land.

10
00:03:08,767 --> 00:03:12,362
His interest was in the balance
and harmony of nature.

11
00:03:17,275 --> 00:03:18,469
Gotcha.

12
00:03:20,011 --> 00:03:23,242
Yep, us Einsteins
had always been apple farmers.

13
00:03:23,682 --> 00:03:26,276
And that's what my dad
had planned for me.

14
00:03:26,351 --> 00:03:29,047
But I just couldn't get the hang of it.

15
00:03:29,221 --> 00:03:31,883
So that's why I was
in the orchard that day.

16
00:03:31,957 --> 00:03:33,584
I was practicing.

17
00:03:42,901 --> 00:03:46,029
Look at this, will you? Tasmanian devils.

18
00:03:46,738 --> 00:03:48,706
Eat anything, they will.

19
00:03:49,808 --> 00:03:52,140
There's one of the mongrels now.

20
00:03:54,846 --> 00:03:56,370
Good day, mate.

21
00:03:59,151 --> 00:04:01,449
He's eating the bloody orchard.

22
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,621
Albert. You okay, son?

23
00:04:11,329 --> 00:04:14,856
For every action
there's an equal and opposite reaction.

24
00:04:15,801 --> 00:04:19,293
I've just formulated
a complete scientific principle.

25
00:04:28,113 --> 00:04:32,379
Well, I had my first
complete scientific theory.

26
00:04:32,918 --> 00:04:35,443
All I had to do was prove it.

27
00:04:59,177 --> 00:05:01,042
Timber!

28
00:05:58,837 --> 00:06:02,273
So you see,
I proved that gravitation is a force...

29
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,831
whereby any two bodies
attract each other...

30
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,606
in proportion
to the product of their masses...

31
00:06:07,679 --> 00:06:11,638
and inversely as the square of the distance
between them, Mom.

32
00:06:12,284 --> 00:06:14,878
You mean what goes up must come down?

33
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,612
Yeah.

34
00:06:36,741 --> 00:06:38,766
Sorry about the roof, Dad.

35
00:06:39,711 --> 00:06:43,203
Don't worry about it, son.
I've got a job for you.

36
00:06:44,816 --> 00:06:48,582
Now, do you know what I'd like you to do
with this valley, Albert?

37
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,251
What, Dad?

38
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:52,884
Dam it!

39
00:06:56,494 --> 00:06:59,986
But if I dammed it,
I'd drown all the wildlife.

40
00:07:00,065 --> 00:07:01,794
Yep, in one go.

41
00:07:06,338 --> 00:07:08,101
Dad, I'm a pacifist.

42
00:07:09,107 --> 00:07:11,598
I believe that all living things...

43
00:07:11,876 --> 00:07:14,777
should be able
to exist together in harmony.

44
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,827
So you see, Dad, I want to be a physicist.

45
00:07:39,871 --> 00:07:41,771
What do they grow, son?

46
00:07:42,741 --> 00:07:46,643
- Physicists don't grow anything.
- What's the use of them, then?

47
00:07:47,178 --> 00:07:50,841
They study the basic laws
and the principles of the universe.

48
00:07:50,915 --> 00:07:54,043
You can study the basic laws
and principles of the universe...

49
00:07:54,119 --> 00:07:57,282
in the evening,
after you've done the washing up.

50
00:08:35,193 --> 00:08:37,923
I'm working on a new kind of music, Mom.

51
00:08:38,663 --> 00:08:40,324
That's nice, dear.

52
00:08:41,533 --> 00:08:44,832
Sometimes I wonder whether
he's cut out for farming.

53
00:08:49,307 --> 00:08:51,832
He just doesn't seem to fit in here.

54
00:09:12,163 --> 00:09:14,256
Time for bed, Albert, love.

55
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:21,837
- Good night, Dad.
- Good night, Albert.

56
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:27,674
- Good night, Albert.
- Good night, Mom.

57
00:09:29,147 --> 00:09:32,514
Sweet dreams, Mommy's little possum.

58
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,886
Albert! So you're a scientist, are you, son?

59
00:09:44,963 --> 00:09:48,160
- Yes, Dad.
- I've got a job for you in the morning.

60
00:10:23,368 --> 00:10:26,201
- Where are we going, Dad?
- Granddad's shed.

61
00:10:26,871 --> 00:10:28,805
It was your granddad's wish...

62
00:10:28,873 --> 00:10:31,433
that an Einstein would carry on
the work that he began.

63
00:10:33,811 --> 00:10:37,076
- What work, Dad?
- You'll find out soon enough, son.

64
00:11:01,673 --> 00:11:06,076
Wow! Granddad built
a scientific laboratory in here.

65
00:11:06,211 --> 00:11:07,940
Shut the door, son.

66
00:11:11,382 --> 00:11:13,009
This is it, Bert.

67
00:11:13,384 --> 00:11:17,115
The thing that will put us Einsteins
into the history books.

68
00:11:17,488 --> 00:11:18,580
Beer.

69
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:20,883
Beer.

70
00:11:23,494 --> 00:11:25,155
What is beer, Dad?

71
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:28,995
The secret of brewing beer
is an Einstein tradition.

72
00:11:29,067 --> 00:11:31,092
My father taught it to me.

73
00:11:31,636 --> 00:11:35,697
He taught it to his father,
and his father to his father's father.

74
00:11:38,509 --> 00:11:40,033
Sit down, Bert.

75
00:11:42,347 --> 00:11:46,078
The problem is,
as is with the problem with all beer...

76
00:11:46,618 --> 00:11:48,609
is that it lacks bubbles.

77
00:11:49,554 --> 00:11:52,182
Well, why don't you put bubbles in it?

78
00:11:53,891 --> 00:11:55,483
Try as it may...

79
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:59,690
mankind has never succeeded
in putting bubbles in beer.

80
00:12:00,632 --> 00:12:04,728
The person who succeeds
will change the world forever.

81
00:12:58,156 --> 00:13:01,216
- Father?
- Not now, Mother. I've got a headache.

82
00:13:36,561 --> 00:13:40,657
Well, there is one thing
that would force bubbles into beer.

83
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:44,634
I mean, I suppose
you can split a beer atom.

84
00:13:46,437 --> 00:13:48,132
Atomic energy.

85
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:54,671
If you could split the nucleus
of a beer atom into two fragments...

86
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,771
then the mass of the two fragments...

87
00:13:57,849 --> 00:14:00,841
will be less than the mass
of the original nucleus...

88
00:14:00,985 --> 00:14:04,682
and the difference in mass
will be transformed into energy.

89
00:14:06,357 --> 00:14:08,552
Energy equals mass...

90
00:14:08,993 --> 00:14:11,325
times the square of the speed of light!

91
00:14:13,798 --> 00:14:15,288
I'll give it a go.

92
00:14:19,937 --> 00:14:21,097
Right.

93
00:14:21,939 --> 00:14:23,167
Bubbles into beer.

94
00:14:25,309 --> 00:14:28,540
First, isolate the molecular structure...

95
00:14:29,113 --> 00:14:30,705
of this alcohol.

96
00:14:35,253 --> 00:14:38,620
Readjust the orbit...

97
00:14:39,157 --> 00:14:41,421
of these electrons.

98
00:14:46,397 --> 00:14:49,389
Then all I have to do
is split this beer atom.

99
00:14:50,101 --> 00:14:51,864
Where's that chisel?

100
00:15:16,727 --> 00:15:19,787
Albert. Is that you?

101
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:23,497
Look, Dad!

102
00:15:26,204 --> 00:15:27,432
Bubbles!

103
00:15:29,106 --> 00:15:31,336
And it's got a good head, too.

104
00:15:36,514 --> 00:15:39,813
Not bad.
This'll put the Einsteins on the map.

105
00:15:42,987 --> 00:15:46,821
- What's happening, Father?
- The boy's finally done it, Mother.

106
00:15:47,191 --> 00:15:50,456
Albert, you're a genius.
How'd you come up with it?

107
00:15:51,128 --> 00:15:54,325
I discovered the formula
for splitting beer atoms.

108
00:15:57,735 --> 00:15:58,895
"Emc."

109
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:02,639
We've got to register this
at the patent office.

110
00:16:02,707 --> 00:16:05,608
Albert, you've got to go to the mainland.

111
00:16:14,619 --> 00:16:16,109
Goodbye, Bert.

112
00:16:18,723 --> 00:16:21,248
- Good luck, son.
- Goodbye, Dad.

113
00:16:22,426 --> 00:16:23,893
Goodbye, Mom.

114
00:16:25,396 --> 00:16:26,954
Goodbye.

115
00:16:27,532 --> 00:16:29,193
My son.

116
00:19:58,809 --> 00:20:00,436
Pardon, monsieur?

117
00:20:01,779 --> 00:20:05,237
- What would you like to do?
- You speak English. Splendid.

118
00:20:05,316 --> 00:20:06,977
Preston Preston...

119
00:20:07,685 --> 00:20:09,550
of the Perth Prestons.

120
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,524
Young Newton.

121
00:20:25,035 --> 00:20:26,866
Isn't this unbelievable?

122
00:20:26,937 --> 00:20:29,667
I, myself, am in the scientific field.

123
00:20:30,407 --> 00:20:33,069
Dozens of scientists come
into my office every day.

124
00:20:33,144 --> 00:20:35,874
Of course, I have to turn
most of them down.

125
00:20:35,946 --> 00:20:38,847
Yes. Science has always
held a fascination for me.

126
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:41,612
For example, do you know
how a gramophone works?

127
00:20:41,685 --> 00:20:43,084
It's really very simple.

128
00:20:43,154 --> 00:20:45,987
The little needle
picks up these vibrations....

129
00:20:47,758 --> 00:20:50,591
What the devil is the engine driver up to?

130
00:20:50,861 --> 00:20:54,422
Stopping the train
in the middle of a desert. Sacré bleu.

131
00:20:55,299 --> 00:20:57,961
Anyway, where was I?

132
00:20:59,136 --> 00:21:00,831
- Very small....
- Yes.

133
00:21:00,905 --> 00:21:03,499
Now, these tiny little vibrations...

134
00:21:03,574 --> 00:21:07,408
are caused by dozens of grooves
which are cut into the disc...

135
00:21:07,478 --> 00:21:11,972
and they go all the way up the arm
to a great big horn which amplifies it.

136
00:21:12,216 --> 00:21:14,810
You know, makes it louder! Like this.

137
00:21:15,719 --> 00:21:18,313
And voilà. A song. See?

138
00:21:25,729 --> 00:21:26,991
Good day.

139
00:21:39,944 --> 00:21:42,139
I'm sorry. Oh, my God.

140
00:21:45,115 --> 00:21:47,106
It's just a little snake.

141
00:21:48,052 --> 00:21:49,542
It's a lizard.

142
00:21:50,487 --> 00:21:51,545
Yes.

143
00:21:52,623 --> 00:21:54,181
Now, sound.

144
00:21:56,627 --> 00:21:58,527
How can I describe it to you?

145
00:21:58,596 --> 00:22:01,292
Sound is like big waves at the beach,
you see...

146
00:22:01,365 --> 00:22:03,856
because sound travels in waves
just like light.

147
00:22:03,934 --> 00:22:07,870
- I'm not going too fast for you, am I?
- No. Light travels as particles.

148
00:22:07,938 --> 00:22:10,304
Light travels as particles and waves.

149
00:22:12,376 --> 00:22:16,472
How can light travel simultaneously
in two different ways?

150
00:22:18,315 --> 00:22:20,715
Space tells matter how to move...

151
00:22:20,885 --> 00:22:23,820
and matter tells space how to curve.

152
00:22:24,188 --> 00:22:27,680
Mademoiselle, you must be
a student of the sciences.

153
00:22:28,626 --> 00:22:31,288
Yes. I am to study
at the Sydney University.

154
00:22:31,362 --> 00:22:33,626
Fascinating. You got a scholarship?

155
00:22:33,831 --> 00:22:35,696
Not exactly. I won a prize.

156
00:22:35,766 --> 00:22:37,791
The old high school science prize?

157
00:22:37,868 --> 00:22:41,269
It was a Nobel Prize,
1903, Applied Physics.

158
00:22:41,338 --> 00:22:43,033
- Really?
- You see...

159
00:22:43,107 --> 00:22:46,873
I think that
if we could control the ionizing radiation...

160
00:22:46,944 --> 00:22:51,142
of the spontaneous disintegration
of uranium isotopes...

161
00:22:52,016 --> 00:22:54,644
we could harness the forces of nature.

162
00:22:54,718 --> 00:22:56,310
Splitting atoms.

163
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,853
You've heard of the theory
to split the nucleus of an atom?

164
00:22:59,924 --> 00:23:01,448
I've split one once.

165
00:23:01,525 --> 00:23:03,755
You've already split the atom?

166
00:23:05,729 --> 00:23:08,163
It was only a Tasmanian beer atom.

167
00:23:08,565 --> 00:23:09,657
What?

168
00:23:10,134 --> 00:23:14,298
That one atom was enough
to blow the old man's shed apart.

169
00:23:14,371 --> 00:23:15,633
Really.

170
00:23:16,807 --> 00:23:18,536
Atomic power.

171
00:23:20,244 --> 00:23:22,872
You must tell me more
about your research...

172
00:23:22,947 --> 00:23:25,438
but first, let me introduce myself.

173
00:23:25,616 --> 00:23:27,982
My name is Marie. Marie Curie.

174
00:23:30,554 --> 00:23:32,852
Albert. Albert Einstein.

175
00:23:33,891 --> 00:23:36,951
Do you realize this is a first-class carriage?

176
00:23:37,361 --> 00:23:40,262
Conductor, there's a bushman
in my carriage.

177
00:23:41,632 --> 00:23:45,398
- So?
- You see, I worked out that...

178
00:23:45,469 --> 00:23:49,098
energy equals mass times
the square of the speed of light.

179
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:07,414
No.

180
00:24:36,687 --> 00:24:38,120
Excuse me.

181
00:24:49,166 --> 00:24:50,190
"Emc?"

182
00:24:50,267 --> 00:24:53,998
Energy equals mass times
the square of the speed of light.

183
00:24:54,071 --> 00:24:57,268
A patent application
must be accompanied...

184
00:24:57,341 --> 00:24:59,809
by a provisional specification.

185
00:24:59,877 --> 00:25:02,107
- What's that?
- An invention.

186
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:05,874
You have to have an invention
to patent an invention.

187
00:25:08,585 --> 00:25:10,553
But it's all in my head.

188
00:25:10,754 --> 00:25:14,656
Well, what do you wish us to do, sir,
patent your head?

189
00:25:17,528 --> 00:25:19,962
We take patents, not formulas.

190
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:44,041
Good day.

191
00:26:45,015 --> 00:26:47,449
Where did you blow in from, curly?

192
00:26:47,918 --> 00:26:49,180
Tasmania.

193
00:26:51,054 --> 00:26:53,716
What's that in your pocket, big boy?

194
00:26:58,695 --> 00:27:00,356
It's a compass.

195
00:27:04,401 --> 00:27:05,800
Excuse me.

196
00:27:09,206 --> 00:27:12,175
Excuse me. Have you got a room?

197
00:27:14,811 --> 00:27:17,803
- This is a hotel, isn't it?
- Yes.

198
00:27:21,185 --> 00:27:23,415
You want the big bed, ace?

199
00:27:24,755 --> 00:27:26,086
Go on.

200
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:29,953
No.

201
00:27:30,961 --> 00:27:33,452
So, you're looking for a room?

202
00:27:36,833 --> 00:27:39,097
You want a room with a window?

203
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:41,937
Yes, please.

204
00:27:59,256 --> 00:28:02,316
Right. Here it is, the penthouse.

205
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:04,624
With en suite bathroom.

206
00:28:27,784 --> 00:28:29,274
Bravo!

207
00:28:38,128 --> 00:28:41,188
That was excitement.
Are you having a good time?

208
00:28:41,598 --> 00:28:43,031
Yes, thank you.

209
00:28:43,667 --> 00:28:45,396
The Marriage of Figaro.

210
00:28:45,469 --> 00:28:49,769
That last piece was, of course, where
Madame Butterfly emerges from the duck.

211
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,330
It was moving.

212
00:28:52,709 --> 00:28:56,702
Preston, do you remember
that strange man from the train?

213
00:28:57,781 --> 00:29:00,272
- Albert Einstein.
- The bushman?

214
00:29:00,851 --> 00:29:02,614
Yes. What about him?

215
00:29:03,287 --> 00:29:05,517
I've been thinking about his theory.

216
00:29:05,589 --> 00:29:08,387
That. Marie, don't waste your time.

217
00:29:08,458 --> 00:29:10,483
Indecipherable nonsense.

218
00:29:11,695 --> 00:29:13,287
Poor beggar probably thought...

219
00:29:13,363 --> 00:29:16,799
he could bring it to Sydney
and sell it for a fortune.

220
00:29:17,034 --> 00:29:19,434
I think it is most remarkable.

221
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:23,164
Imagine. Splitting atoms.

222
00:29:23,507 --> 00:29:25,532
And such primitive equipment.

223
00:29:25,609 --> 00:29:29,067
Yes, a good trick, I suppose.
But really, Marie...

224
00:29:29,146 --> 00:29:31,114
one scientist to another...

225
00:29:32,883 --> 00:29:34,441
bubble research.

226
00:29:34,518 --> 00:29:37,612
It's not that stimulating, now, is it?

227
00:29:38,121 --> 00:29:39,918
On the contrary, Preston.

228
00:29:40,057 --> 00:29:43,288
I think his formula
has enormous potential.

229
00:29:44,961 --> 00:29:46,258
Really?

230
00:29:56,306 --> 00:29:57,671
Good.

231
00:29:59,109 --> 00:30:02,943
It's worthless, of course,
but why don't you leave it with us?

232
00:30:14,424 --> 00:30:17,655
- To our new and lucrative partnership.
- Yes.

233
00:30:21,298 --> 00:30:23,198
- Emc?
- You think it will work?

234
00:30:23,266 --> 00:30:26,235
Believe me, Herr Wolfgang,
you're not going to regret this.

235
00:30:26,303 --> 00:30:29,363
This formula will revolutionize brewing
as we know it.

236
00:30:29,473 --> 00:30:32,670
- You and I are going to be very, very rich.
- Rich!

237
00:30:49,226 --> 00:30:51,558
1, 2, 3, 4...

238
00:30:51,628 --> 00:30:54,392
5, 6, 7, 8.

239
00:30:56,433 --> 00:30:57,957
A musical beat.

240
00:30:58,235 --> 00:31:00,669
1, 2, 3, 4.

241
00:31:01,204 --> 00:31:03,900
The beat, 2, 3, 4.

242
00:31:03,974 --> 00:31:07,569
Downbeats are on one and three.
The backbeats are on two and four.

243
00:31:07,978 --> 00:31:10,913
So the upbeat acceleration is equal...

244
00:31:10,981 --> 00:31:13,973
to the escape velocity of the downbeat.

245
00:31:20,424 --> 00:31:22,449
Upbeat equals downbeat.

246
00:31:24,428 --> 00:31:28,330
In that state,
gravity will roll to the downbeat.

247
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:33,327
Therefore, the body motion
must rock to the upbeat.

248
00:31:33,804 --> 00:31:37,069
I've just invented a new musical theory.

249
00:31:37,941 --> 00:31:39,704
Roll and rock.

250
00:32:52,115 --> 00:32:54,049
What are you doing, Albert?

251
00:32:54,918 --> 00:32:58,615
A scientific musical theory
based on the human heartbeat.

252
00:32:59,756 --> 00:33:01,417
You're so clever.

253
00:33:02,859 --> 00:33:05,828
No, actually, anyone could play it.

254
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:08,463
It's simple.

255
00:33:08,832 --> 00:33:11,892
Four bars, four beats to the bar...

256
00:33:12,536 --> 00:33:14,128
with a backbeat.

257
00:33:22,612 --> 00:33:24,512
I think I'll go to bed.

258
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:28,344
Night.

259
00:33:46,803 --> 00:33:49,431
Music is the motion of sounds.

260
00:33:50,006 --> 00:33:52,839
And motion is measured by speed.

261
00:33:53,643 --> 00:33:57,374
Therefore, I could increase
the intensity of the music...

262
00:33:57,948 --> 00:34:00,849
by amplifying the volume of the beat...

263
00:34:01,151 --> 00:34:03,016
by the speed of light.

264
00:34:03,553 --> 00:34:06,078
That's 186,000 miles per second.

265
00:34:06,756 --> 00:34:08,621
That's fast, very fast.

266
00:34:08,992 --> 00:34:11,324
At upwards of 119 decibels...

267
00:34:11,895 --> 00:34:13,487
that's very loud.

268
00:34:13,563 --> 00:34:15,929
Well, the only way
to get a result like that...

269
00:34:15,999 --> 00:34:18,593
will be to electrify a musical instrument.

270
00:35:00,644 --> 00:35:02,043
What's this?

271
00:35:02,712 --> 00:35:04,509
It electrifies music.

272
00:35:04,714 --> 00:35:07,615
It electrifies music, does it?

273
00:35:08,585 --> 00:35:10,450
Just what we need.

274
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,885
You do?

275
00:35:24,901 --> 00:35:26,630
And stay out!

276
00:35:29,572 --> 00:35:31,904
- Here, Albert.
- What happened?

277
00:35:38,782 --> 00:35:39,908
It's here.

278
00:35:39,983 --> 00:35:43,578
Do you know the way to the university?
Thank you.

279
00:35:43,653 --> 00:35:45,143
It's come.

280
00:35:53,196 --> 00:35:54,663
Sheep farming.

281
00:35:54,864 --> 00:35:56,525
- Scholarship?
- Yep.

282
00:35:58,168 --> 00:36:00,261
Get in there. Go on.

283
00:36:04,207 --> 00:36:08,041
- I'm looking for Marie Curie.
- The beautiful French scientist?

284
00:36:09,379 --> 00:36:10,778
Science, $1.

285
00:36:13,116 --> 00:36:14,606
That's a bit steep.

286
00:36:15,685 --> 00:36:16,845
Excuse me.

287
00:37:42,539 --> 00:37:44,006
And stay out!

288
00:37:50,013 --> 00:37:51,378
You fail.

289
00:37:55,552 --> 00:37:57,884
You embarrassed me in there.

290
00:37:57,954 --> 00:38:00,889
Sorry. It's just that your teacher
was so wrong.

291
00:38:02,659 --> 00:38:06,095
He was very angry.
I don't think he understood at all.

292
00:38:08,665 --> 00:38:11,361
Your mind is astonishing.

293
00:38:28,418 --> 00:38:30,545
- Look at Albert.
- Is that Albert?

294
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:33,316
- He looks so different.
- Look at his hair.

295
00:38:33,389 --> 00:38:36,415
- I don't think I should ask him now.
- I think you should.

296
00:38:36,492 --> 00:38:38,084
You ask him.

297
00:38:39,696 --> 00:38:40,958
Go on!

298
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:47,036
How come Newton's theory
doesn't account for Galileo's law?

299
00:38:47,103 --> 00:38:48,195
Yeah.

300
00:38:48,271 --> 00:38:50,967
With a multitude
of different simultaneities...

301
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,371
within the universe...

302
00:38:52,442 --> 00:38:55,707
how can any gravitational effect
be suddenly everywhere...

303
00:38:55,778 --> 00:38:58,178
at a common, simultaneous instant?

304
00:39:02,118 --> 00:39:03,483
Told you.

305
00:40:22,699 --> 00:40:24,894
You know, Marie, when you compare...

306
00:40:24,968 --> 00:40:27,903
all of science in the world against nature...

307
00:40:28,204 --> 00:40:30,729
science is just primitive and child-like...

308
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,608
but it's the most precious thing we have.

309
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:37,202
Albert, if only this moment
would last forever.

310
00:40:38,314 --> 00:40:40,908
If only time could stand still.

311
00:40:43,686 --> 00:40:45,017
That's it!

312
00:40:45,488 --> 00:40:47,718
That's the theory of relativity.

313
00:40:47,957 --> 00:40:49,151
What?

314
00:40:49,659 --> 00:40:52,787
Light travels to us
from the hands of that clock...

315
00:40:52,862 --> 00:40:54,625
to tell us the time.

316
00:40:55,398 --> 00:40:59,300
If we could travel away from that clock
at the speed of light....

317
00:40:59,669 --> 00:41:03,105
Then the hands of the clock
would appear to have stopped.

318
00:41:03,172 --> 00:41:06,664
Time would stand still.
This moment would last forever.

319
00:41:12,982 --> 00:41:15,382
- Did you just think of that?
- Yes.

320
00:41:20,923 --> 00:41:22,413
Where do you live?

321
00:41:57,627 --> 00:42:00,255
- Are you okay, mister?
- Yep.

322
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:05,894
I am writing to recommend
a most brilliant scientific thinker...

323
00:42:06,069 --> 00:42:07,297
Albert Einstein.

324
00:42:08,971 --> 00:42:12,566
I would be personally
indebted to you, Monsieur Preston...

325
00:42:12,708 --> 00:42:16,439
if you would consider him
for a position in your office.

326
00:42:17,313 --> 00:42:20,009
I know his assistance
would be invaluable to you...

327
00:42:20,083 --> 00:42:23,575
in the most complex areas
of scientific research.

328
00:42:25,488 --> 00:42:28,582
It's simple, double entry
bookkeeping, Einstein!

329
00:42:29,425 --> 00:42:32,087
In the right column,
you write what's left out.

330
00:42:32,628 --> 00:42:33,686
Left out?

331
00:42:33,763 --> 00:42:36,231
In the left column, you write what's left in.

332
00:42:36,299 --> 00:42:37,425
Left in.

333
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:40,094
So all that's left in is left, right?

334
00:42:40,603 --> 00:42:41,763
Left right?

335
00:42:41,838 --> 00:42:44,864
And all that's left out,
you write in the right columns, right?

336
00:42:44,941 --> 00:42:47,273
So nothing's left out, right?

337
00:42:47,343 --> 00:42:48,833
Left outright?

338
00:42:53,082 --> 00:42:54,982
Dear Mom and Dad...

339
00:42:56,185 --> 00:42:58,676
I hope you are both well.

340
00:43:02,525 --> 00:43:05,961
I have a good job at the patent office...

341
00:43:08,631 --> 00:43:12,533
and I've found a nice place to live.

342
00:43:16,606 --> 00:43:18,631
"I have met a wonderful girl.

343
00:43:18,708 --> 00:43:20,471
"I will write again soon.

344
00:43:20,543 --> 00:43:22,602
"Your loving son, Albert.

345
00:43:22,778 --> 00:43:26,305
"PS: I think I have almost discovered...

346
00:43:26,682 --> 00:43:28,673
"the key to the universe."

347
00:43:29,685 --> 00:43:31,277
He's met a girl!

348
00:43:33,089 --> 00:43:34,386
A girl?

349
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:42,430
It's not that Einstein is stupid.

350
00:43:42,498 --> 00:43:44,193
- Madame?
- No, thank you.

351
00:43:48,171 --> 00:43:50,503
Have you seen those boots that he wears?

352
00:43:50,573 --> 00:43:54,737
He's raw, rough. Coarse, if you like.

353
00:43:55,378 --> 00:43:56,743
Coarse?

354
00:43:56,812 --> 00:43:59,406
He's a loner. He's not one of the team.

355
00:44:00,683 --> 00:44:03,117
- And that is a bad thing?
- Terrible.

356
00:44:03,186 --> 00:44:06,019
It has a terrible effect on office morale.

357
00:44:09,258 --> 00:44:12,352
It's not that he doesn't have
a modicum of potential.

358
00:44:12,428 --> 00:44:14,055
It's just that....

359
00:44:15,131 --> 00:44:17,361
I don't know where he would be...

360
00:44:17,433 --> 00:44:20,527
without the patience
of people like you and I.

361
00:44:20,603 --> 00:44:23,538
It was very nice of you to do this for me...

362
00:44:25,474 --> 00:44:28,443
and thank you for a very pleasant time.

363
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:34,274
I've been thinking of expanding
onto the world stage...

364
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:36,841
and I want you to be there with me.

365
00:44:38,321 --> 00:44:41,256
I love you, Marie, with all my heart.

366
00:44:42,291 --> 00:44:45,522
And if this wasn't such an exclusive club...

367
00:44:45,595 --> 00:44:47,062
I'd kiss you.

368
00:44:49,265 --> 00:44:51,927
Preston, you're so sweet, but I --

369
00:44:52,001 --> 00:44:54,799
Think about what I've said, darling.
Go now.

370
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:57,304
- But, Preston --
- Not another word.

371
00:44:57,573 --> 00:44:59,905
I know how you must be feeling.

372
00:45:10,886 --> 00:45:12,046
Right.

373
00:48:05,928 --> 00:48:08,453
Every day, without fail,
you've been late for work.

374
00:48:08,531 --> 00:48:11,466
You see, there are two 8:00's.

375
00:48:11,567 --> 00:48:14,092
One in the morning and one at night.

376
00:48:14,770 --> 00:48:19,036
Therefore time is relative to the observer.

377
00:48:19,341 --> 00:48:20,968
- Time is --
- Money.

378
00:48:21,777 --> 00:48:23,267
Time is money.

379
00:48:24,713 --> 00:48:26,908
Mr. Einstein, you're not fooling anyone.

380
00:48:26,982 --> 00:48:29,041
Out of consideration
for Mademoiselle Curie...

381
00:48:29,118 --> 00:48:31,416
I have tolerated behavior
which would've landed...

382
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:34,718
most junior assistant clerks
on the street in a matter of minutes.

383
00:48:36,091 --> 00:48:37,854
I like you, Albert.

384
00:48:39,862 --> 00:48:42,490
I wish you'd think of me as a friend.

385
00:48:42,965 --> 00:48:46,662
Not many men would be
forthright enough to tell you this...

386
00:48:47,636 --> 00:48:51,003
but you have no ability,
no talent, and no potential.

387
00:48:51,373 --> 00:48:55,173
I'm going to do you a favor, Albert.
I'm going to let you go.

388
00:49:49,632 --> 00:49:51,099
Mr. Einstein!

389
00:49:52,067 --> 00:49:55,969
Preston Preston's building a machine
to split beer atoms.

390
00:49:58,607 --> 00:50:00,598
He's using your formula.

391
00:50:00,843 --> 00:50:02,401
Look. Here.

392
00:50:04,813 --> 00:50:06,178
No.

393
00:50:17,459 --> 00:50:18,687
Open up!

394
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:39,379
Hold everything!

395
00:50:39,448 --> 00:50:41,075
- What's going on?
- Excuse me.

396
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:43,243
You're disrupting the beer production.

397
00:50:43,319 --> 00:50:46,846
It's too dangerous.
You can't build that machine.

398
00:50:47,556 --> 00:50:48,818
Can't I?

399
00:50:50,926 --> 00:50:52,860
- You're crazy.
- Got you.

400
00:50:54,897 --> 00:50:57,229
- Fruitcake.
- Where are we going?

401
00:51:15,351 --> 00:51:16,750
Rutherford.

402
00:51:17,553 --> 00:51:19,248
Ernest Rutherford!

403
00:51:25,594 --> 00:51:26,993
Rutherford.

404
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:29,925
Asprin's the name.

405
00:51:30,933 --> 00:51:32,400
Brian Asprin.

406
00:51:33,535 --> 00:51:34,729
Brian.

407
00:51:34,937 --> 00:51:36,734
What are you in for?

408
00:51:37,339 --> 00:51:39,967
Oh, space and time curved?

409
00:51:41,143 --> 00:51:43,668
Personally, I got busted for drugs.

410
00:51:44,913 --> 00:51:47,575
Science? I'm keenly interested.

411
00:51:47,983 --> 00:51:50,144
Pleased to meet you, Keenly.

412
00:53:13,902 --> 00:53:16,063
What are you up to, Einstein?

413
00:53:16,138 --> 00:53:18,129
- Physics, Keenly.
- May I?

414
00:53:21,543 --> 00:53:23,306
A relativity theory.

415
00:53:24,446 --> 00:53:25,970
That's clever.

416
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,219
But, you know, Einstein...

417
00:53:40,295 --> 00:53:43,128
a theory like this would only be viable...

418
00:53:43,198 --> 00:53:45,758
if the speed of light were constant.

419
00:53:46,535 --> 00:53:47,934
I'm sorry.

420
00:53:48,971 --> 00:53:50,939
- It is.
- Constant?

421
00:53:51,006 --> 00:53:52,132
Is that a fact?

422
00:53:52,207 --> 00:53:56,007
It's not only constant,
but nothing can travel faster than it.

423
00:53:56,078 --> 00:53:58,706
Nothing can travel faster than light?

424
00:53:59,014 --> 00:54:02,108
What if I'm on a train
that's traveling at the speed of light...

425
00:54:02,184 --> 00:54:06,177
and I move forward from
the back carriage to the front carriage?

426
00:54:06,455 --> 00:54:09,219
Then I'd be traveling faster than light.

427
00:54:09,792 --> 00:54:11,453
No, you wouldn't.

428
00:54:14,363 --> 00:54:17,025
But that's an affront to common sense.

429
00:54:17,466 --> 00:54:20,060
- That's relativity.
- Relativity.

430
00:54:22,037 --> 00:54:25,996
In my book, Newton says
that the laws of the universe are fixed.

431
00:54:26,441 --> 00:54:27,999
Newton's wrong.

432
00:54:29,711 --> 00:54:31,611
- What have you done with him?
- Who?

433
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:34,478
Albert Einstein.
You stole his formula, didn't you?

434
00:54:34,550 --> 00:54:36,814
- I did not.
- How could you do such a thing?

435
00:54:36,885 --> 00:54:39,513
He had nothing.
No money, no equipment...

436
00:54:39,588 --> 00:54:41,488
he didn't even have an education.

437
00:54:41,557 --> 00:54:44,458
He had to come up
with the entire theory in his head.

438
00:54:44,526 --> 00:54:46,357
And you, you just take it.

439
00:54:46,428 --> 00:54:49,829
Marie, I did not just take it.
I merely borrowed it...

440
00:54:49,898 --> 00:54:53,493
in order to develop
a lucrative proposition for us all.

441
00:54:53,902 --> 00:54:56,735
Einstein will get a percentage, of course.

442
00:54:56,805 --> 00:54:59,239
I hate you for what you have done.

443
00:54:59,608 --> 00:55:02,133
I don't see
what you're getting so upset about.

444
00:55:02,211 --> 00:55:04,941
Somebody had to make something of it.
He never would.

445
00:55:05,013 --> 00:55:08,107
He wouldn't, would he?
We'll see about that.

446
00:55:14,990 --> 00:55:18,050
Hello. I'm looking for Albert Einstein.

447
00:55:18,126 --> 00:55:21,687
- He's not here.
- But I know he's here.

448
00:55:21,797 --> 00:55:24,231
- He's taking a bath.
- I'll wait.

449
00:55:24,299 --> 00:55:27,029
Mr. Einstein is a notoriously long bather.

450
00:55:27,102 --> 00:55:29,696
In my opinion,
it would be pointless for you to wait.

451
00:55:29,771 --> 00:55:31,762
I will wait forever.

452
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:34,172
- Are you a relative?
- No.

453
00:55:34,243 --> 00:55:37,269
We'll let in only relatives
and the immediate family.

454
00:55:50,792 --> 00:55:54,558
Every time
I think of your relativity theory...

455
00:55:55,898 --> 00:55:57,525
I get a headache.

456
00:55:57,966 --> 00:55:59,263
Sorry, Brian.

457
00:55:59,334 --> 00:56:02,235
- I dropped the soap.
- Careful.

458
00:56:14,683 --> 00:56:17,015
You're his father?

459
00:56:17,653 --> 00:56:20,121
- Yes.
- All right.

460
00:56:24,326 --> 00:56:26,920
The inmates are all in the shower
this time of day.

461
00:56:28,163 --> 00:56:30,961
As much as I would like to go in there...

462
00:56:31,033 --> 00:56:32,967
this is as far as I go.

463
00:56:39,775 --> 00:56:40,935
Tiger!

464
00:56:41,910 --> 00:56:43,309
Bugger off!

465
00:56:45,681 --> 00:56:47,046
Excuse me.

466
00:56:47,849 --> 00:56:50,283
I am looking for Albert Einstein.

467
00:56:51,553 --> 00:56:53,180
I am his father.

468
00:56:54,623 --> 00:56:56,488
That's him over there.

469
00:56:58,794 --> 00:57:01,354
Everybody! Einstein's father's here!

470
00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:03,125
Einstein's father?

471
00:57:34,696 --> 00:57:36,163
Close family.

472
00:57:50,312 --> 00:57:53,042
I've been searching for you everywhere.

473
00:57:55,417 --> 00:57:57,783
Preston stole your beer formula.

474
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:01,048
I know. I'm a bit worried about that.

475
00:58:01,690 --> 00:58:03,385
E=mc2?

476
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:06,293
Yep, that's the one.

477
00:58:06,361 --> 00:58:09,524
That's not just a beer formula.
That's dangerous.

478
00:58:09,598 --> 00:58:11,225
What's he done, Professor?

479
00:58:11,299 --> 00:58:13,494
He's hit upon
the elusive formula for energy.

480
00:58:13,568 --> 00:58:15,195
What, the formula for energy?

481
00:58:15,270 --> 00:58:18,364
- He better make sure nobody applies it.
- Albert!

482
00:58:19,441 --> 00:58:23,901
They're saying he intends to build
the largest beer keg in the world!

483
00:58:27,249 --> 00:58:28,716
He's a woman!

484
00:59:06,521 --> 00:59:08,853
Albert, you have to take action.

485
00:59:08,924 --> 00:59:12,485
It is your duty to make people understand
what is happening.

486
00:59:12,561 --> 00:59:15,394
Marie, I don't understand
what's happening.

487
00:59:16,264 --> 00:59:18,061
I'll tell you what's happening.

488
00:59:18,133 --> 00:59:21,899
Your formula's a blueprint
for the destruction of the world.

489
00:59:24,272 --> 00:59:27,366
Some pacifist Einstein turned out to be.

490
00:59:27,943 --> 00:59:29,433
Smarty-pants.

491
00:59:29,678 --> 00:59:31,771
You've done it now, Einstein.

492
00:59:33,448 --> 00:59:35,075
I'm sick of this.

493
00:59:35,617 --> 00:59:38,916
I'm sick of brains!
All this thinking all the time.

494
00:59:39,187 --> 00:59:40,984
Think, think, think.

495
00:59:41,289 --> 00:59:43,780
I want a man who will do something.

496
00:59:43,859 --> 00:59:46,123
- Marie, I --
- And if you won't...

497
00:59:47,596 --> 00:59:49,086
then who will?

498
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:33,162
Look out.

499
01:03:21,209 --> 01:03:23,404
Marie! It's me, Albert!

500
01:03:24,145 --> 01:03:25,442
I'm free!

501
01:03:40,061 --> 01:03:41,961
- Hello, Albert.
- Albert!

502
01:03:42,497 --> 01:03:44,294
Where have you been?

503
01:03:44,933 --> 01:03:46,423
Mental asylum.

504
01:03:46,735 --> 01:03:49,704
We can't work out
how space can be curved.

505
01:03:49,771 --> 01:03:51,534
Sounds really silly.

506
01:03:51,606 --> 01:03:54,541
I can't work out
where Marie could have gone.

507
01:03:55,510 --> 01:03:58,604
I suppose that could be
in the letter she left.

508
01:04:00,548 --> 01:04:01,606
Yes.

509
01:04:05,754 --> 01:04:07,119
"Albert.

510
01:04:07,555 --> 01:04:09,955
"I will cherish our time forever.

511
01:04:10,992 --> 01:04:14,086
"We were just children
playing on the seashore.

512
01:04:14,696 --> 01:04:19,065
"At times, we found a smoother pebble
or a prettier shell than ordinary.

513
01:04:21,102 --> 01:04:24,765
"But the great ocean of truth
lays out there before us...

514
01:04:24,839 --> 01:04:26,966
"untouched and undiscovered.

515
01:04:27,776 --> 01:04:30,301
"If only you'd been a man of action.

516
01:04:31,379 --> 01:04:32,573
"Marie."

517
01:04:32,847 --> 01:04:34,508
No, nothing here.

518
01:04:34,783 --> 01:04:36,216
Poor Albert.

519
01:04:36,284 --> 01:04:39,811
Hold on. There's an address
on the back of the envelope.

520
01:04:39,888 --> 01:04:41,378
"Marie Curie.

521
01:04:42,056 --> 01:04:43,353
"France."

522
01:04:45,727 --> 01:04:47,388
Good luck, Albert.

523
01:05:10,318 --> 01:05:13,754
The Academy of Sciences

524
01:05:20,161 --> 01:05:22,891
Gentlemen and ladies, welcome.

525
01:05:22,964 --> 01:05:25,455
Tonight we are honored and excited...

526
01:05:25,533 --> 01:05:28,058
to have with us
the most distinguished scientists...

527
01:05:28,136 --> 01:05:29,899
of the 20th century.

528
01:05:29,971 --> 01:05:31,700
I wish to personally welcome...

529
01:05:31,773 --> 01:05:34,435
Marconi wireless listeners
around the world.

530
01:05:34,509 --> 01:05:38,036
Marconi.: The fastest growing name
in broadcasting today.

531
01:05:40,515 --> 01:05:44,007
This year's nominees include
Mr. Thomas Edison...

532
01:05:45,286 --> 01:05:48,119
with his new electric light!

533
01:05:51,092 --> 01:05:54,528
This has been an astonishing year
for scientific achievements.

534
01:05:54,596 --> 01:05:58,589
From United States of America,
the Wright brothers.

535
01:06:02,070 --> 01:06:05,096
What did you all say
you did again? Psycho....

536
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:06,964
Psychoanalysis.

537
01:06:07,675 --> 01:06:11,736
Psychiatric scientist from Austria,
Prof. Sigmund Freud.

538
01:06:12,447 --> 01:06:15,280
Prof. Freud is here tonight
with his mother.

539
01:06:15,350 --> 01:06:19,081
Sigmund, don't pick your nose!

540
01:06:24,459 --> 01:06:27,257
THE RENTAL

541
01:06:37,505 --> 01:06:39,837
Marconi is broadcasting live...

542
01:06:39,908 --> 01:06:43,105
from the Science Academy here in Paris.
And now....

543
01:06:47,582 --> 01:06:50,244
A woman's place is in the home, Maman.

544
01:06:51,286 --> 01:06:52,548
Louis.

545
01:06:54,088 --> 01:06:57,751
All this science of hers,
it will amount to nothing.

546
01:06:58,026 --> 01:07:00,358
She won the Nobel Prize, Pierre.

547
01:07:01,296 --> 01:07:03,457
And this year she won the award...

548
01:07:03,531 --> 01:07:07,262
for the best scientific achievement
by a woman.

549
01:07:08,069 --> 01:07:11,505
That is my point, Maman. She is a woman.

550
01:07:13,374 --> 01:07:16,537
She needs a man, not a test tube.

551
01:07:32,093 --> 01:07:34,254
Marie, go and see who it is.

552
01:07:34,896 --> 01:07:36,261
Oui, Papa.

553
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:41,291
- Watch it, mate.
- Albert.

554
01:07:43,137 --> 01:07:47,198
Marie, I decided that you were right.
We have to talk.

555
01:07:48,142 --> 01:07:49,268
Talk?

556
01:07:49,711 --> 01:07:53,272
It could vaporize the world,
and you want to talk?

557
01:07:53,715 --> 01:07:55,512
Louis, throw him out.

558
01:07:56,884 --> 01:07:58,044
And stay out!

559
01:07:58,119 --> 01:08:00,280
- Who is it?
- He's nobody.

560
01:08:00,355 --> 01:08:01,549
He?

561
01:08:08,029 --> 01:08:11,055
- Who is this barbarian?
- I'm a Tasmanian.

562
01:08:11,132 --> 01:08:14,260
Maman, Papa, this is Albert Einstein.

563
01:08:16,237 --> 01:08:20,469
Mr. Curie, I'll be taking Marie
to the Science Academy Awards tonight.

564
01:08:20,541 --> 01:08:24,409
That is impossible.
Paris is hundreds of kilometers away.

565
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:26,879
Besides, the ceremony
has already started.

566
01:08:26,948 --> 01:08:29,041
Mr. Curie, I couldn't help but notice...

567
01:08:29,117 --> 01:08:31,813
you've got a hot-air balloon
parked out the front.

568
01:08:31,886 --> 01:08:34,411
I'll be needing to borrow it for the evening.

569
01:08:34,489 --> 01:08:37,117
It is almost out of gas at the moment.

570
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:43,091
Sir, this is a question
of survival of life on this planet.

571
01:08:51,205 --> 01:08:55,335
Worldwide listeners,
the moment we have all been waiting for.

572
01:08:58,346 --> 01:09:02,373
The president
of the International Science Academy...

573
01:09:02,450 --> 01:09:06,750
the most distinguished scientist
in the world...

574
01:09:07,021 --> 01:09:09,421
Sir Charles Darwin!

575
01:09:27,709 --> 01:09:28,903
Bravo!

576
01:09:43,157 --> 01:09:46,854
It is my pleasure to announce...

577
01:09:50,665 --> 01:09:53,361
the 1906 Science Academy Award.

578
01:09:58,072 --> 01:10:00,939
So, who will win?

579
01:10:06,013 --> 01:10:07,503
Nobody knows.

580
01:10:09,550 --> 01:10:13,145
What would you say
to a bit of light entertainment, Mother?

581
01:10:13,221 --> 01:10:15,985
A bit early in the day for that, Father.

582
01:10:17,892 --> 01:10:20,224
I was referring to the wireless.

583
01:10:38,579 --> 01:10:40,740
It is my privilege...

584
01:10:41,649 --> 01:10:43,810
to introduce a young man...

585
01:10:43,885 --> 01:10:46,581
who's come all the way...

586
01:10:48,256 --> 01:10:50,121
from Australia.

587
01:10:50,925 --> 01:10:53,621
Tonight he's going to show us...

588
01:10:53,694 --> 01:10:57,755
a most remarkable scientific formula.

589
01:11:00,468 --> 01:11:01,992
It couldn't be.

590
01:11:06,674 --> 01:11:09,268
Mr. Preston Preston.

591
01:11:11,379 --> 01:11:15,076
Thank you, Sir Charles. A great pleasure.

592
01:11:22,456 --> 01:11:26,153
Since mankind
came down from the trees...

593
01:11:28,896 --> 01:11:31,831
he has sought the elusive formula...

594
01:11:31,899 --> 01:11:34,959
that would put bubbles into his beer.

595
01:11:36,103 --> 01:11:38,537
I have made it my life's quest...

596
01:11:39,173 --> 01:11:41,698
to discover that formula.

597
01:11:43,778 --> 01:11:46,645
Now here it is!

598
01:12:06,834 --> 01:12:09,997
- There's the science academy, Marie.
- Oui, Albert.

599
01:12:10,071 --> 01:12:11,834
I'm taking her down.

600
01:12:27,221 --> 01:12:30,588
- Quickly.
- I'll let some more air out of the balloon.

601
01:13:16,237 --> 01:13:17,898
An atomic chamber?

602
01:13:18,973 --> 01:13:21,464
But that would split millions of atoms.

603
01:13:21,542 --> 01:13:23,442
We have to tell Darwin.

604
01:13:25,279 --> 01:13:29,147
And now, fellow scientists,
the world's first --

605
01:13:29,216 --> 01:13:30,615
Mr. Darwin.

606
01:13:33,721 --> 01:13:36,383
Preston's built an atomic bomb.

607
01:13:37,591 --> 01:13:38,990
Atomic bomb?

608
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:40,186
What?

609
01:13:40,261 --> 01:13:41,558
No, I didn't!

610
01:13:41,629 --> 01:13:46,089
Mr. Preston, do you know what happens
if you split an atom at its nucleus?

611
01:13:46,167 --> 01:13:47,691
Atomic fission.

612
01:13:48,736 --> 01:13:51,296
This man is an escaped lunatic.

613
01:13:55,776 --> 01:13:59,212
That barrel is a gigantic atomic bomb.

614
01:14:01,015 --> 01:14:03,848
Mr. Preston. Stop!

615
01:14:04,552 --> 01:14:08,215
It's harmless, you stupid old man! Look.

616
01:14:14,996 --> 01:14:16,486
It is a bomb.

617
01:14:35,416 --> 01:14:38,214
Albert, if the bomb goes off, then....

618
01:14:39,253 --> 01:14:41,983
Just a moment, Marie. I'm having an idea.

619
01:14:52,366 --> 01:14:54,357
Save me. Where do I run?

620
01:14:56,070 --> 01:14:58,504
It's an atomic bomb, Mr. Preston.

621
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:01,840
There's nowhere to run to.

622
01:15:49,090 --> 01:15:50,990
Albert, what are you doing?

623
01:15:51,058 --> 01:15:53,925
Well, I'm going to use this instrument...

624
01:15:55,162 --> 01:15:58,063
to drain the atomic energy
out of that bomb.

625
01:15:58,933 --> 01:16:02,664
But you cannot. You cannot reverse
an atomic chain reaction.

626
01:16:03,037 --> 01:16:05,005
Better stand back, Marie.

627
01:16:25,059 --> 01:16:27,994
- That's Albert's music.
- Yes. Crikey, yes.

628
01:16:28,729 --> 01:16:32,028
- It's 4/4 time.
- 4/4 time.

629
01:16:32,133 --> 01:16:34,101
That'll drain the power out of anything.

630
01:16:46,213 --> 01:16:47,510
It's working.

631
01:16:47,581 --> 01:16:50,914
Whatever you are doing, keep doing it.
It's working!

632
01:17:00,861 --> 01:17:04,456
It's all his fault. Albert Einstein.

633
01:17:04,698 --> 01:17:07,565
What kind of a name is that
for a scientist?

634
01:17:15,576 --> 01:17:17,407
How am I doing, Marie?

635
01:17:55,816 --> 01:17:57,283
Albert!

636
01:18:04,391 --> 01:18:08,054
You are absorbing too much energy.
You will be killed.

637
01:18:14,802 --> 01:18:19,068
I'm all right, Marie. They're only electrons.

638
01:19:25,906 --> 01:19:28,704
Get your hands off me!
You call yourselves scientists?

639
01:20:27,134 --> 01:20:29,898
Albert. Is that you?

640
01:20:33,507 --> 01:20:35,099
Look, Dad.

641
01:20:48,222 --> 01:20:50,247
What's happening, Father?

642
01:20:51,859 --> 01:20:53,087
Albert.

643
01:21:09,443 --> 01:21:10,501
Dad.

644
01:21:11,845 --> 01:21:12,971
My son.

645
01:21:13,046 --> 01:21:16,072
Mom, I'd like to meet my girlfriend, Marie.

646
01:21:17,251 --> 01:21:20,049
Marie, I'd like you to meet my mom.

647
01:21:22,222 --> 01:21:23,587
Hello, dear.

648
01:21:26,894 --> 01:21:29,988
I'm going to ask Albert Einstein
for a private science lesson.

649
01:21:30,063 --> 01:21:32,463
- I saw him first.
- So what?

650
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:35,800
The boy's finally done it, Mother.

651
01:21:35,869 --> 01:21:39,896
He's registered the theory "Emc."
We'll be rich.

652
01:21:42,109 --> 01:21:45,545
Dad, Mom, Marie...

653
01:21:46,780 --> 01:21:50,546
I've decided to donate my theory
to all the nations of the world...

654
01:21:50,617 --> 01:21:54,018
to be used peacefully
for the benefit of all mankind.

655
01:21:54,087 --> 01:21:57,682
But, Albert,
what if the governments of the world...

656
01:21:57,758 --> 01:22:00,386
use your theory to make atomic bombs?

657
01:22:00,694 --> 01:22:05,461
Marie, if you can't trust the governments
of the world, then who can you trust?

658
01:22:10,437 --> 01:22:12,302
Speech!

659
01:22:12,773 --> 01:22:14,741
Come and give a speech.

660
01:22:14,808 --> 01:22:17,140
Come on, Albert! Speech.

661
01:22:20,614 --> 01:22:21,672
No.

662
01:22:55,516 --> 01:22:57,950
I could tell you my latest theory.

663
01:23:01,188 --> 01:23:02,951
Albert's beer, mate.
