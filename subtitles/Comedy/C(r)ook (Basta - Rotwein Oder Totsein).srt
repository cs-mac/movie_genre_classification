1
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:47,160
Did you know where the
spirits go after people die?

2
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,320
Many believe that the spirits...

3
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:56,880
will remain close to us in a parallel world.

4
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:07,028
And sometimes they may even try
to talk to us to tell us something.

5
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,995
"Possessed"

6
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,550
Three. Two. One.

7
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,751
Action!

8
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,560
Hi, I'm Pent. I'm the director
of a short film called...

9
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,440
To eternal lovee until death do us part
and I will never break your heart.

10
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,680
Is that a poem or a moveie
title? You sure about that?

11
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,470
I'm inspired by a true story
that once happened here.

12
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,240
It was a story about a blind rich girl...

13
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:35,440
who fell in lovee with a deaf poor man.

14
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,514
This is where they met.

15
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,880
Naturally, the girl's parents intervened...

16
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:48,720
and forced her to marry some rich guy.

17
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,040
As soon as the man found out...

18
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:57,360
he decided to kill himself
and gave her his eyes.

19
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:04,760
So when the girl...who could now
see learned about the sacrifice...

20
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,840
she killed herself too. Right here.

21
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,520
Bullshit!

22
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:17,358
I was told that someone actually
hung herself right in that pavilion.

23
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,680
well, then use that to promote the film.

24
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,720
Tell people this is based on true story.

25
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,080
If they don't buy it, well...screw 'em.

26
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,392
Japan, why don't you go
check on the camera?

27
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,560
Go on. Get your ass moveing.

28
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,869
what are you up to, Mr. Zenjen?

29
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,075
I'm hearing veoices?/ whose veoices?

30
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,431
Shhh...

31
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:57,035
I heard something. what is it?

32
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:48,154
Shit!/ That's funny.

33
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,040
This tomboy is a cameragirl.
Her name is Ying.

34
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,800
what are you filming this for?

35
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,560
what you see is not always what you get.

36
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,836
This macho-looking guy is a She-Man

37
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,680
Hey! what the hell? Asshole!

38
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,880
This young lady is a general assistant.

39
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,840
Ji, can you look at the camera?

40
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,640
I'm doing the behind-the-scene
thing for YouTube.

41
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:20,634
It's gonna be a blockbuster. Trust me.

42
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,471
Ji. Ji.

43
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:37,640
There's a ghost behind you./ what
the hell? what's wrong with you?

44
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,880
It's way past 9 a.m. and we
haven't even started yet.

45
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,920
Quit screwing around./ what
do you want me to do?

46
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,000
There's no one around. But
I just saw our leading man.

47
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,879
Go fetch him./ All right. I'll go get him.

48
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,790
Not me.

49
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,520
what?/ what on earth are
you doing back here?

50
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,880
I'vee been looking all oveer for you.

51
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,080
I'm just trying to memorize the script.

52
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,160
Memorize the script? / That's right.

53
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,880
You're playing a dumb
guy...you know...can't talk.

54
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,040
There's nothing to memorize.

55
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:52,000
Listen! Even though I can't talk...

56
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,680
"l still have to work on my
feelings... expressions...

57
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,355
gestures...tones...you
know...the whole shebang.

58
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,996
An amateur like you wouldn't understand.

59
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,800
Are you guys ready to rock and roll?

60
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,000
I was ready since yesterday.

61
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,514
That's why I'm here.

62
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:52,275
May your spirit be reincarnated.
Please leave me alone.

63
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,720
May your spirit be reincarnated.

64
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,680
I'll make merit and dedicate it to you.

65
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,593
Hey! what's wrong?

66
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,517
A ghost./ Ghost?

67
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,080
where is it?/ It was right here.

68
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,799
I don't see any.

69
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:38,989
You can't... cause you
don't have a sixth sense.

70
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,230
This man is a cemetery guard.

71
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,634
Listen! I'm really sorry about this.

72
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,430
How long will you guys be
here for?/ Just one day.

73
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,080
well, try not to stay up too late
then. You might irk the others.

74
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:07,800
who are the others? It's just us oveer here.

75
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,759
I'm talking about those
lying under the ground.

76
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,315
That'd be great.

77
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,480
Our film will be much more
realistic if they could join us.

78
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,109
Beware of what you wish for./ Are they real?

79
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:36,794
Hurry up! we don't have all day.

80
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,400
what's with all the light checking?

81
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:46,520
It changes anyway./ I don't like it this way.

82
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,829
Knock it off, will you?

83
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,520
what the hell is wrong with you guys?

84
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:54,149
when're we gonna start shooting?

85
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,720
Need I yell every single
take? My throat's killing me.

86
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,632
water?

87
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,311
Thanks!

88
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,071
How're you doing?

89
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,360
You ok?

90
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,680
I'm fine./ Good.

91
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,229
Go get some lunch for the crew.

92
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:32,594
Go get some food. Please.

93
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,509
I don't know how to drivee.

94
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,948
Come on. All right!

95
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,233
what're you doing?/ Buckle it up for you.

96
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,235
what do you think?

97
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,078
Are you upset?/ what for?

98
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,440
You seem quiet./ There's
nothing to talk about.

99
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,640
So... what brought you here?

100
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:41,560
Aof asked me to come./
He's your boyfriend?

101
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:45,160
Are you crazy? He's my cousin

102
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:50,240
I see. That's why you look
just like him./ Really?

103
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,196
Not really.

104
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:58,360
Hi, Chompoo. where're you
at now?/ I'm in Bangkok.

105
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,560
Bangkok? why are you still there?

106
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,600
You're already several hours late.

107
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,600
I'm really sorry.

108
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:12,755
Right now I'm painting my nails,
but I can leave in about two hours.

109
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,791
what do you mean?

110
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,200
It won't open.

111
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,919
The handle broke. Gotta
open from the outside.

112
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,396
Be my guest.

113
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,878
Pent!

114
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,440
It's all because of you.

115
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,400
You wanted to hire a superstar
and she stood us up.

116
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,231
Now what?

117
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,311
Japan, who else can fill in this role?

118
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,876
Do you feel lonely?

119
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,633
what's taking her so long?

120
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,760
A cameragirl as a leading
lady? I can't believe it.

121
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,640
Givee me a break. we have no other choice.

122
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,920
I think she's good for the role.

123
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,400
Are you an amateur?

124
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,789
Making a tomboy a leading lady.

125
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,036
I'm ready.

126
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:15,360
Look at those shoes./ Don't
you have other pairs?

127
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,751
You'll just have to deal with it.

128
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,151
Action!

129
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:34,395
Honey... do you realize
you're the lovee of my life?

130
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,600
Cut! Cut!

131
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,880
what is that?/ why did you cut that?

132
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:45,750
I saw something in the
camera./ I didn't see any.

133
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,153
That's impossible.

134
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,193
I tagged along...hoping to see a ghost.

135
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,160
I always wanted to see one.

136
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,596
Grisly ghost! Grisly ghost!
Grisly ghost my ass.

137
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,631
Come on.

138
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:13,269
I saw something flashing by just now.

139
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,717
where?

140
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:21,438
Ok... on the count of three...

141
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,314
If it doesn't show up... we'll leave./ Deal.

142
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,959
One.

143
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,839
Two.

144
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,833
Three.

145
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,389
Let's go.

146
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,280
I'm so disappointed...

147
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:54,320
I didn't get to see one. Maybe
I needed to count longer.

148
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,153
Yeah, right.

149
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:05,554
Don't be naughty. I'll come back in a bit.

150
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,156
who're you talking to?

151
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,472
A baby ghost./ Baby ghost?

152
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,760
You think I'm crazy, don't you?/ Not at all.

153
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:28,160
I hope all crazy people are as pretty as you.

154
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,593
That is so corny.

155
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:34,676
Here you go./ No, thanks.

156
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,954
How do you raise the baby ghost?

157
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,396
It's not that hard. Just feed him every day.

158
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,920
wanna raise one too?/ Not really.

159
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,912
I don't want to talk to myself.

160
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,471
But I really do see him.

161
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:14,720
Scene 2, Cut 1... 52nd take already.

162
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,188
Haste makes waste...haven't you heard?

163
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,118
Action!

164
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:49,278
Are we doing this forever?
I'm freezing to death.

165
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,560
Cut! Let's take a break.

166
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,949
Japan, coveer for me please.

167
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:05,399
You look really sexy soaking wet like this.

168
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,514
Pervert!

169
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:28,120
You should go pay respect to
the guardian spirit after this.

170
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,640
I'm veery busy.

171
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,870
But my assistant is probably available.

172
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,037
No way. I hate the burning incense.

173
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,358
Son of a bitch!

174
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,638
Here's your lunchbox.

175
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,595
Thanks!

176
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,600
wow! You look fantastic.

177
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,955
Had I known you'd turn
out to be pretty like this.

178
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,920
I would'vee asked you out when we first met.

179
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:42,400
For the record... the feeling is not mutual.

180
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,391
That's harsh

181
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,800
Hi, dad.

182
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,429
Are you gonna come home
for the ancestor veeneration?

183
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,554
I can't. I need to finish this film.

184
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,320
But you'vee been missing it for many years.

185
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:11,400
I'm really busy, pop. Besides grandpa
must'vee been reincarnated by now.

186
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,871
You're an ingrate. That's
why you're still a nobody.

187
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,838
I'm done talking to you. That's it.

188
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,440
I'm so sick of it.

189
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:34,310
It's always worshipping this and
that it's a waste of time and money.

190
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:39,276
Your grandpa must be so proud of you.

191
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,360
Ji is a poor girl.

192
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:19,993
Her dad is a runaway felon...
for selling fake amulets.

193
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,720
Her mom is really into spiritual beings...

194
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,640
and her friends think she's
the witch's daughter.

195
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,394
I don't realize her life is so eventful.

196
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,320
That's why she's a recluse...

197
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,320
Locks herself up in a room after school...

198
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,600
Doesn't talk to anybody much...
I'm afraid she'll go nuts.

199
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,912
So I take her here... hoping
to brighten things up for her.

200
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,760
Are you gonna cry?/ Nope.

201
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,877
This is too spicy for me.

202
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,757
Sorry.

203
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,395
Are you lonely?

204
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,472
wanna go home?

205
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,910
we'll be home real soon.

206
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:42,880
Pent... do you have it in another color?

207
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,640
This is like a see-through dress.

208
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,240
People can see the outline of my underwear.

209
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,320
This is the funeral. You
want an orange dress?

210
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:56,160
If you got one... sure./ I think
you look really sexy in that.

211
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:00,472
I can barely see your pantie./ Barely?

212
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,120
Hey, babe. Hit me baby
one more time./ Babe?

213
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,240
Cut it out.

214
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,200
He's a creep.

215
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,240
Let's get back to work.

216
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,560
You pervert./ That's enough.

217
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:19,270
Get back to work, Ying./
what're you staring at?

218
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,199
what's wrong with these two?

219
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:57,200
Hey, Book. why don't you
movee the offerings out?

220
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,160
It looks better that way./ Are you sure?

221
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:03,118
Just movee them out. I'm about to start now.

222
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,480
All right / Hurry up!

223
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,232
Hold on, guys.

224
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:14,600
I think you should ask for
permission before moveing them.

225
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:18,280
That won't be necessary.

226
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,480
You worry too much. I'm
sure the dead won't mind.

227
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,880
That's right. we're just
shooting a short film.

228
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,269
Take them out, Book.

229
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,395
Don't worry about it.

230
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,080
I'll start from the end to the beginning.

231
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,040
It's Hollywood's latest trend./
whatever floats your boat

232
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,840
Gosh!

233
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:52,720
Hey, Book. where is the
coffin I asked you to bring?

234
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,120
Look, Pent./ what?

235
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,000
You gave me only a few bucks.

236
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,160
How am I supposed to
get a coffin with that?

237
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,040
what do you think?

238
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:04,600
You're asking me? That's
all the money we got.

239
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,920
That's plenty, I think

240
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,680
Anyway you're the Art Director
it's your job to figure it out.

241
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,720
So what?

242
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,720
what? / what? You want me to dig one out?

243
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,240
They shouldn't have any
problem./ That's not a bad idea.

244
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:22,720
we can save money. That
might work./ what a moron!

245
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,240
Knock it off. Stop it!

246
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:29,760
why don't you go look around?
See if we can borrow a spare one.

247
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,512
Go on.

248
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,320
Get out of here. what an attitude! You idiot.

249
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:39,599
You think this is a Hollywood
film? It's just a senior project.

250
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:54,874
Uncle./ what is it, boy?

251
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:59,000
Do you have a spare coffin I can borrow?

252
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,916
who's dead?/ No one.
It's for a prop in our film.

253
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,956
No problem. Just a second.

254
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,549
Ok, let's go.

255
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,000
Look at all these graves, boy.

256
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,520
They're coveered with oveergrown grass.

257
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:26,308
Nobody cares about them anymore.

258
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,910
The children have forgotten that...

259
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,840
they have today because
their dead ancestors...

260
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:40,120
had worked so hard to raise them.

261
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:43,795
Maybe they don't have
time. It's pretty far out.

262
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,520
They always have time to
go somewhere, don't they?

263
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,400
Even oveerseas.

264
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:54,428
what about your own
children?/ I'vee got three.

265
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:00,840
Haven't seen any lately
though./ And your wife?

266
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,920
She's here./ Here?

267
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,720
How come I'vee never seen her?

268
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,554
That's because she's six feet under.

269
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,320
Japan./ what?

270
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:17,760
why don't you find something
to coveer the picture of the dead?

271
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,920
I think it's better off without
that./ Do it yourself.

272
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:24,595
what're you scared of? All right. I'll do it.

273
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:30,880
Always an excuse. Every single one of you.

274
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:35,271
Book is one./ So are you.

275
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,832
will this work?

276
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,080
I think so.

277
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,840
It's just what we need.

278
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,440
Today is the Chinese's Ghost Day.

279
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:17,034
That's why I haven't buried this one.

280
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,280
You mean there's a body in there?

281
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:25,320
Sure. You wanna take a look?

282
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:29,836
I can show you. You can
ask him to be in your film.

283
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,838
Thanks, but no thanks.

284
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:37,076
I just want an empty coffin.

285
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:42,200
well, I don't have any.
This is the only one left.

286
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,350
Do you still want it?

287
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:58,674
Hmm, how about this?

288
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:04,680
I'll take the body out first
and bring just the coffin.

289
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:08,120
when I'm done I'll put
the body back in there.

290
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,960
No way. That's strictly forbidden.

291
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,200
Once the body's in, you can't take it out.

292
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,320
The spirit will be lost can't find its way back.

293
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,640
And one more thing.

294
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:42,317
If someone smells or hears
something... don't say a word.

295
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:48,476
when you movee the coffin
always go forward. Never back.

296
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:52,560
Also, don't make a noise...

297
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:56,951
and don't ever let the
coffin touch the ground.

298
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:04,800
Always find something to cushion.
Can you remember all these?

299
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,870
I believe so.

300
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,000
Hey, Japan. Focus the camera on me.

301
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,878
I want to make sure people see me.

302
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,680
Can we change this portrait? I don't like it.

303
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,720
It's too late now./ Take a good look at this.

304
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,880
we're running out of daylight.

305
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,880
Take it easy.

306
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,240
Cut it out, you guys./ wait a minute.

307
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,000
This is the best we'vee got./ Damn it!

308
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,800
You never listen to me./
No, you listen to me.

309
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,680
Shit! It's hot./ You deserve it, asshole.

310
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,480
Now, listen to me./ what?

311
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:50,560
I'm doing this for free.../ l
could'vee made 20 bucks a day.

312
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:55,160
You know how much that is?

313
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,200
It's getting heavy.

314
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,280
It's heavy./ I know.

315
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:02,796
Shut up. I'm trying to concentrate.

316
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,310
where is this smell coming from?

317
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,880
Shit! It really stinks.

318
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,400
All right. Let's get ready./ Ok.

319
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,231
Action!/ wait a minute.

320
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,279
what is it again?/ My portrait.
It needs some cleaning up.

321
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,320
All done. Ready to roll.

322
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,390
Movee it. You're blocking the camera.

323
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,477
Ok. Ready?

324
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,231
Action!

325
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,555
I can handle it myself.

326
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:58,712
Slow down a bit./ Yeah. Slow down a bit.

327
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,710
Slower./ Slower.

328
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,634
A little slower./ A little slower.

329
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,196
Damn!

330
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,680
Can't you movee in unison?/
Yeah. Movee in unison.

331
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,640
That's it./ That's it.

332
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,760
Step further back./ That's
right. Step further back.

333
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,440
I can't focus the camera./ He can't focus.

334
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:21,760
Stop repeating after me./ Holy shit!

335
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,116
Hey, Japan. Concentrate, will you?

336
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,440
I'm sweating like I'm in a sauna.

337
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,440
Ready?/ Yes.

338
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,113
Take two. Action!

339
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,600
Cut! Cut!/ what again?

340
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,592
Zenjen. what now?

341
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:55,311
I'm hearing something in my headphone.

342
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:08,269
That's impossible. There's no one around.

343
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,960
Are you sure?

344
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,838
I'm positivee. I definitely heard something.

345
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:20,114
Maybe it's from some people
nearby./ Yeah. Maybe.

346
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:26,594
Dear grandpas and grandmas. May
I please continue my shooting?

347
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,596
Please let us finish our job.

348
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:34,560
It's gone. we're ready to go.

349
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:38,680
Hey, Book. why is the
coffin so damn heavy?

350
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,638
why not? There's a body inside.

351
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:47,479
why do you stop moveing?

352
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,991
Ji. Ji.

353
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,230
She's going into shock.

354
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:27,518
This will require a mouth-to-mouth.

355
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:43,993
Ji. Ji./ Let him go.

356
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,551
Are you ok?

357
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:52,112
why did you hit me,
bitch?/ You insulted me.

358
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:56,709
Insulted you? Are you kidding me?

359
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,797
Ji, what's wrong?

360
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:13,477
Can any of you help?

361
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:26,080
what just happened?/ You pretentious slut.

362
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:30,073
Are you sure you didn't know anything?

363
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,955
Ji, what happened?

364
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:57,558
Look...there is an old
man... sitting on the coffin.

365
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,480
You guys find someone else.

366
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,630
I'm out of here.

367
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,913
Hey, Japan.

368
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,830
I'm also out.

369
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:30,910
This is so spooky./ Ying. Ying.

370
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,874
wait up! / Hey, Zenjen.

371
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,160
we're out as well.

372
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:42,359
This is not what we signed
up for. Let's get the hell out.

373
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:48,520
It's all because of you, Book.

374
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:52,720
why did you bring a real coffin?/
Now the shit is all on me?

375
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,400
You suck. You can't handle your job.

376
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,320
You suck more. I gotta go through shit.

377
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,040
I can't work with you anymore.

378
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:05,670
Fine. Go do something else. I don't care.

379
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,360
You can count me out. I'm out of here.

380
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,396
Fine. Get out!

381
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:23,471
well, everyone's out
now. So what do we do?

382
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:30,550
Pack our shit. Get out of here.

383
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,672
Here we are. The gas station.

384
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,717
Pull oveer.

385
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,152
Hurry!

386
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:20,273
You're not using the bathroom?/ I'm fine.

387
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,359
want me to get something for you?

388
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,437
I'm coming with you.

389
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:42,080
Can you go in with me?/
You want me that bad?

390
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,040
Don't flatter yourself... I'm just scared.

391
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:51,600
Hey, Ying./ wait right
here. And... no peeking.

392
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,068
Ok. Hurry up!

393
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,593
Hey, Ying.

394
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:13,429
will you take it easy? I can almost picture it.

395
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,634
Shut up!

396
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:22,431
I'vee got something to tell you./ what?

397
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:28,040
I think I'm in lovee with
you. will you be my girl?

398
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,560
You idiot.

399
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:32,520
This is your idea of romance?
I'm so not into it right now.

400
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:35,193
what's the matter?

401
00:39:51,200 --> 00:40:01,792
I think you're really pretty when you smile.

402
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:12,194
How can I smile when...

403
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:19,080
when what?

404
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,958
when I'm...

405
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:30,319
Nothing.

406
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,440
So...what are you going to do next?

407
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:49,912
I'll probably shoot the film myself.

408
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:56,315
I'm going to direct it this time.

409
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:08,313
Let me know if there's
anything I can do./ Really?

410
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:25,839
The coffee is kind of bitter, don't you think?

411
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:32,789
It could...use some sweetener.

412
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,317
Just kidding.

413
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,240
You son of a bitch. what is wrong with you?

414
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,708
Scared the shit out of me.

415
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,800
You know in a horror film...

416
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:12,080
A ghost always appears in
the mirror. Just like this.

417
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:15,834
You idiot! what're you trying to pull?

418
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:19,560
I almost shit in my pants.

419
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:22,280
Because you saw yourself in the mirror?

420
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,680
Right...you look just like
Robert Pattinson yourself.

421
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:27,558
Thanks for the compliment.

422
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,910
who could be calling now?

423
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,040
Hello./ what's up, Dave?

424
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:40,032
Is my car key with you?

425
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:46,480
Yep. I'll mail it to you tomorrow.

426
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:51,920
Tomorrow my ass! You
have to bring it here now.

427
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,520
I was going to.../ No, you listen to me.

428
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:59,240
I can't leave my car here. It's a classic.

429
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,880
You dig? It'll be stolen.

430
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:06,238
All right. I'll bring it back to you
then./ Now! Right this second!

431
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:11,038
Guys, I'll have to bring the key back to Dave.

432
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:22,749
Stop howling... you stupid dogs.

433
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,960
Can't you stop more gently?

434
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,680
It's ABS technology.

435
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,910
where is he? I can't see him.

436
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,400
I'm sorry...the number you'vee reached...

437
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,153
Damn! His phone's dead.

438
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:05,720
Let's go and find him./ we're not going.

439
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:08,109
You go ahead, Aof.

440
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,600
Thanks so much... for your kind support.

441
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:14,353
Come on. Go.

442
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,596
You idiot.

443
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:31,957
where can he be?

444
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,880
God damn it. You scared me, man.

445
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:44,280
I thought you weren't coming.

446
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:47,240
I think we should go back
now. Just leave the key here.

447
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:49,960
He'll be back soon./ I can't just leave.

448
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,960
He'll kill me if something
happens to his car.

449
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,480
This car?

450
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:59,280
Look at this. I don't even know
how it still runs. It's ancient.

451
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,720
Givee him a break.

452
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:05,474
Let's go look in the pavilion.
He might be in there.

453
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:16,040
why couldn't you just wait at the car?

454
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:19,480
It would save me a lot of trouble.

455
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:22,560
Actually this place is not that scary.

456
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:26,280
You could'vee come out here by yourself.

457
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,794
Yeah, right.

458
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:33,153
It's actually kinda nice here.

459
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:38,520
And l...will always lovee
you./ Shut the hell up.

460
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:42,513
why? I'vee got good veoice./
This is not the time.

461
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,552
Let's go inside.

462
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,920
Quit acting like a child./
That was a classic gag.

463
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:51,309
Let's get in.

464
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:03,916
This door could definitely use some lube.

465
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:13,520
Is that Dave?

466
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,910
I think so. Let's check it out.

467
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:41,560
Aof, I think he's dead.

468
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:46,520
we need to get out of here./ Hold on.

469
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:50,149
He might still be alivee. I gotta help him.

470
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:55,838
An asshole like him deserves to die anyway.

471
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:08,473
what's all the commotion about?

472
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,160
Dave / Yep!

473
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,640
I thought you were dead.

474
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:18,111
Dead? I just asked him to rub my neck.

475
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:21,920
You want some?/ No, thanks.

476
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:25,629
I thought you killed him.

477
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:28,354
You son of a bitch!

478
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:32,199
You pee in your pants?

479
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:38,911
Stop jumping around. You're spilling it.

480
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,591
My shoes.

481
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,911
Put that away. It's embarrassing.

482
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:50,000
See you later, losers.

483
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,880
Pent. Next film... it's 20 bucks per day.

484
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:55,480
That's a lot of money.

485
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:59,393
And if the afterlife is real
hope we'll never meet again.

486
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:10,760
Are you sure he's normal?

487
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:14,469
Good luck and godspeed.

488
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:17,513
Let's go home. I'm exhausted.

489
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:22,431
You guys can't go just yet./ why's that?

490
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:25,960
You have to take the coffin back first.

491
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:28,600
Otherwise...you know...

492
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:31,956
you may not be able to get out of here

493
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:39,120
wait a minute. where're you going?

494
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:44,680
I'm going back to get some sleep.

495
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:47,000
Stay with us, uncle.

496
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:51,640
Tonight is the 7th lunar month./ Oh, is it?

497
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:54,520
You wanna take us to the full moon party?

498
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:57,160
what are you kids talking about?

499
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:00,232
It's the Chinese's Ghost Day.

500
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:05,680
Tonight, hell's gate opens up...

501
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:10,310
and the spirits will come
out to take the offerings.

502
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:25,320
That sounds more like an urban legend.

503
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:29,320
You don't have to believe
me. I'm just warning you.

504
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:31,120
All right, I'm leaving now.

505
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:36,353
And don't forget to bring the coffin back.

506
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:46,311
Ok. Let's do it so we can all go home.

507
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:49,193
It's not my job.

508
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:55,560
Maybe we can do it tomorrow.

509
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:58,440
Are you sure?/ Absolutely!

510
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:01,000
Fine.

511
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:07,358
Ji & Book...a match made in heaven.

512
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:14,796
I'll do it tomorrow. Don't
worry. Let's go home now.

513
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:06,560
Book, this doesn't look familiar at all.

514
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:14,920
Are you sure this is the way
out?/ He knows what he's doing.

515
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:18,071
I recognize this red pavilion.

516
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:23,040
why do you stop?

517
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,560
Someone just cut in front of our vean.

518
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:28,560
Did we hit him?/ I don't
care. Let's get out of here.

519
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:32,680
I don't think it's human./
That's right. Let's get going.

520
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:34,477
Come on, Book.

521
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:40,758
But I think you should go check it out.

522
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:43,757
Shit!

523
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:45,793
Book.

524
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:04,552
I don't see anything at all.

525
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:08,200
why don't you take a look underneath?

526
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,680
He might be down there.

527
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:12,716
That's scary.

528
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:31,320
There's nothing down there, is there?

529
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:32,992
Nope.

530
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:37,318
See... I was right.

531
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:44,196
Guess not.

532
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:54,430
This is too close for
comfort. This is not nice.

533
00:52:54,680 --> 00:53:00,676
Open the door... I can't stay
here anymore./ wait up!

534
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:24,760
I can't open it.

535
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:29,959
Ji, recite your incantation./ That's right.

536
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,991
I don't know how.

537
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:48,312
well... ask your baby ghost to help
then./ Yeah, ask your baby ghost

538
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:55,560
I can't. It's all bogus.

539
00:53:55,560 --> 00:54:05,310
what about you being
possessed?/ That was a fake too.

540
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:11,235
You bitch. You'vee been
fooling us all this time?

541
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:37,798
Can you spare some change?

542
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:46,757
Damn! I thought you were
a ghost. Just a beggar.

543
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,080
why did you do it?

544
00:54:55,080 --> 00:55:04,400
I wanted you guys to believe it
so you wouldn't insult the dead.

545
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:07,198
That's why you did it?

546
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:10,040
I'm so sorry.

547
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:16,040
Don't be. I'm not buying
it. You're such a liar.

548
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:21,160
what more do you want?
She said she's sorry.

549
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:23,993
Let's get out of here.

550
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:34,280
Ji...Ji...

551
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:36,794
Something's wrong with her.

552
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:42,840
You're faking it again,
bitch?/ Take it easy, Ying.

553
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,910
Allow me...

554
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,198
what was that for?

555
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:12,360
You haven't learned, have you?

556
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:14,800
A Chinese ghost, huh?

557
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,800
I know Chinese.

558
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:19,880
Let me demonstrate my kung-fu movees.

559
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:21,160
Ying.

560
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:23,720
I think it's real this time.

561
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:27,240
Look at the blood.

562
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:30,000
If you really wanna know
if she's possessed...

563
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:34,073
you have to see through your legs.

564
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,758
Really? / Really.

565
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:53,593
wow! Your ass is huge.

566
00:56:55,200 --> 00:57:01,150
Stop kidding around. I'm serious.

567
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,316
what did you see?

568
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:22,509
A ghost.

569
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:29,914
who is it?

570
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:34,120
Maybe it's your grandpa.

571
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:36,236
How do you know?

572
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:41,873
He's probably upset that you
didn't go pay him respect today.

573
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:51,918
I'm so sorry, grandpa. Please forgivee me.

574
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:58,832
what did he say?

575
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:02,948
He said you're an asshole.

576
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:05,720
Asshole? Are you sure?

577
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:09,160
Do you really know how to speak Chinese?

578
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:13,153
I took some lessons. I'm pretty sure.

579
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:20,238
Or is it the one you
spray-painted on his picture?

580
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:26,320
Please accept my apology. I didn't mean to.

581
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:28,276
I'm really sorry.

582
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:35,358
what did he say?

583
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:41,400
He said that's not his picture.

584
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:44,551
why did he hit me then?

585
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:51,670
well?/ His friend asked him to.

586
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,436
Oh, I think I know.

587
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:03,160
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean
to pee on your grave.

588
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:06,675
I was wrong. I deserve to die.

589
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:14,000
what did he say?/ That's
not his grave either.

590
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,879
That's a relief. Thanks so much.

591
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:19,555
what's that for?

592
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:25,470
well?/ You're getting on his nerves.

593
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:30,153
Getting on his nerves? Now we're even.

594
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:37,480
I know... Must be the one in
the coffin we used in our film.

595
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:39,720
How do you know that?

596
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:43,000
That's easy. Most ghost films are like that.

597
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,600
Some ghosts come back for revenge.

598
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:46,920
Some for belongings, and some for lovee.

599
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:51,560
This one is probably upset that
no one knows where his body is...

600
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:54,233
or something like that.

601
00:59:56,440 --> 01:00:02,913
See? He said I'm right./
That's not what he said.

602
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:07,358
He said... he's going to kill us.

603
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:14,118
Can you ask him what he wants from us?

604
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:18,156
what do you want? You damn ghost!

605
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:21,240
Hey, be nice to him.

606
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:23,515
we just want to know what he wants.

607
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:29,720
Translate that.

608
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:35,360
He wants us to bring him back to his grave.

609
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:39,920
well, it's your grave...
we're not coming with you.

610
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:42,150
All right. Let's do it.

611
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:16,555
So... nobody's coming with me?

612
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:35,912
what are you guys waiting for? Come on.

613
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:46,400
Ying./ what?

614
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:50,280
You stay back here and watch her.

615
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:53,272
You want me to stay here with her?/ Yes.

616
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:55,437
I don't think so.

617
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:58,560
You're the best person.

618
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:02,553
You're the only one who can speak Chinese.

619
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:09,599
I'll stay with you./ I'd rather stay with him.

620
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:12,911
Come on. Let's get moveing.

621
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:16,040
what do you think you're doing, Book?

622
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:18,156
He probably needs some air.

623
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,475
You're so considerate.

624
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,152
Shall we?

625
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:35,238
Aof, wait up.

626
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:59,035
what's wrong with you?/ I'm scared.

627
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:03,760
No need to be...oops.

628
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:06,800
what's wrong with you two?

629
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:08,760
Keep it down.

630
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:11,069
Not my turf.

631
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:16,998
It's spooky.

632
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:23,191
Shit!

633
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:27,276
why is the lid open?

634
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:58,360
where's the surprise?

635
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:04,390
In a typical ghost film, this
is the "surprise" moment.

636
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:11,396
Lizard. Lizard!

637
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:18,511
Do you believe in Ghost Day?

638
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,800
why are you asking me this?

639
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:29,000
I just wanted to know... when
the ghosts will come out.

640
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,037
why don't you givee your grandpa a call?

641
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:39,431
Did you see that?/ what is it?

642
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:42,828
I wouldn't ask if I knew.

643
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:47,471
would you stop bombarding
me with questions?

644
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:50,672
I'm terrified now.

645
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:14,318
why did he honk?

646
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:34,396
Help! Help!

647
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:36,910
Let go of her.

648
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:49,960
Help me!

649
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:51,520
Stop yelling.

650
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:52,880
Slow down.

651
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:55,600
I told you two to stay and
watch Ji. why are you here?

652
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:58,040
well, she almost killed us both.

653
01:05:58,040 --> 01:06:03,240
Her face's turned into an
old man. It's frightening.

654
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:06,994
I'm going back there./ wait for me, Book.

655
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:09,720
I'm with you.

656
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:12,360
Hurry!/ Hey, come back.

657
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:17,354
I'm not going back there. Are you? No.

658
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:38,394
Hi, how're you?

659
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:41,514
Hello. Excuse me.

660
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:48,718
Do you happen to know the way
out? It's quite confusing in here.

661
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:57,560
Keep going straight.

662
01:06:57,560 --> 01:07:03,880
Take a right when you see a big oak tree...

663
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:09,200
then take a left at the anthill...

664
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:18,916
and take one more left turn when
you get out of the cemetery.

665
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:24,240
That's it? Thanks! But it
sounds really complicated.

666
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:25,880
I got bad memory... you know?

667
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:30,000
So if you're not busy, why don't
you come along for the ride?

668
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,520
we'll split up at the gate.

669
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:34,353
I'm waiting for my boyfriend.

670
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:39,436
well, do let me know when
your boyfriend's away then.

671
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:50,151
Must'vee never been out in
the sun... so damn pale.

672
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:57,030
See you later, beautiful.

673
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:02,829
Remember, when your
boyfriend's away, let me know.

674
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:09,677
Pervert!

675
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:18,993
Damn! where's she?

676
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:20,520
That's good.

677
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:24,399
I'll go find her.

678
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:29,400
This is a cemetery.

679
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:31,920
Not a city center that you can
roam around anytime you want.

680
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:33,990
Are you crazy?

681
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:44,392
Hey, wait up./ Easy.

682
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:47,558
why didn't you ask me to come?

683
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:50,638
You were too full of yourself.

684
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:52,916
Hey, guys.

685
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:58,229
where do you think the body went?

686
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:05,560
well, it's possible that the
coffin was empty at first.

687
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:07,152
Yeah.

688
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:13,830
A twist ending that fools us all...

689
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:18,830
but if it ends like this the veiewers will kill us.

690
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:23,275
will you stop thinking we're in a moveie?

691
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:29,590
The atmosphere is so right.

692
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:36,840
what are you gonna do if
something grabs your leg?

693
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:42,836
Shut up already. I nearly pissed my pants.

694
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:44,600
Don't worry.

695
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:49,515
Usually it's the one at the
back who gets the action first.

696
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:58,560
Guys. Help me please. I fell into a hole.

697
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:00,240
Pent.

698
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:02,360
Hey./ what?

699
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:03,920
Come on. Help me out.

700
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:06,275
Stop pointing the flashlight at me.

701
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:08,080
This is great.

702
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:09,720
The other hand.

703
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:13,110
Can't find a better way out, can you?

704
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:20,560
Are you all right?

705
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:21,600
Hey!/ what?

706
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:23,795
Is that a hand on your leg?

707
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:50,150
what is that?

708
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:59,200
Are you laughing at me?
You laughing at me?

709
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:01,316
I'm gonna kick your ass.

710
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:05,156
what the hell?

711
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,160
She was here a second ago.

712
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:11,240
where the hell is she?

713
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:13,200
Maybe she ran off.

714
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:18,752
You'd better not let me catch you
or I'll beat the crap out of you.

715
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:35,030
who is it? Aof, go take a look./ wait up.

716
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:49,480
Don't you recognize me?/ It's Dave.

717
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:52,120
I thought you were long gone./ I was lost.

718
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:53,720
I drovee around and my car fell into a mire.

719
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:56,600
what are you guys doing
here?/ we're looking for Ji

720
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:59,120
Ji? where did she go?

721
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:02,120
She was possessed by a spirit
and now she's disappeared.

722
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:03,280
Possessed?/ Yes.

723
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:04,720
If I know which one of them did that...

724
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:08,156
I'm gonna beat the crap out
of it./ No need for veiolence.

725
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:10,993
She's right behind me?

726
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:16,520
This can't be her.

727
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:20,160
Doesn't look anything like
her at all./ Yes, this is her.

728
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:22,320
But she didn't look this old then

729
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:25,596
Step back./ Hurry!

730
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:30,000
No doubt.

731
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,993
She looks much older.
what's going on here?

732
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:40,120
what did she say?/ Tell me.

733
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:42,360
wait. wait.

734
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:46,876
She mumbled something about helping her.

735
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:55,120
It has something to do with crying... I think.

736
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:57,400
You'd better shut your mouth.
Ying. what did she say?

737
01:13:57,400 --> 01:14:01,720
She said her body is in the swamp.

738
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:06,080
If that's so we'll need to
call the police for help.

739
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:08,514
Take it easy./ Call the police.

740
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:16,320
More... she wants something more?

741
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:18,675
Shut up!

742
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:20,640
what does it mean?

743
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:25,395
She wants us to get her body
out of the swamp right now.

744
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:30,120
Really? Is she nuts? who's gonna do it?

745
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:31,880
I won't. My pretty face might get infection.

746
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:35,395
I can't swim... swear to God.

747
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:39,040
I'm a girl. I'm not going in.

748
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:42,440
Me too. I'm chicken. I'm a wimp.

749
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:45,240
That was well synchronized... you bitches.

750
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:47,879
who's gonna do it then?

751
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:53,758
I will.

752
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:58,472
wow! Dave. I'm impressed.

753
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:09,440
what I just said, I take it back.

754
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:13,800
Auntie, I'll take care of it for you.

755
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:16,633
Dave.

756
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:26,830
Shit! I'm sinking.

757
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:47,390
what's all these? It really stinks.

758
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:51,640
Unbelievable. It's gotta be around here.

759
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:54,313
Damn smell.

760
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:12,395
Hey... I found it. I found it./ Bring it out.

761
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,514
The stench's getting stronger.

762
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:44,716
Lizards. Lizards! Get
me out of here. Lizards.

763
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:49,112
Stay away from me. Help. Help. Help me.

764
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:54,036
The lizards are all oveer the
place. They're everywhere.

765
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:59,080
I think he's being eaten
alivee./ what do we do?

766
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:01,230
Let's help him.

767
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:12,310
what is that for?/ Come on. Let's do it.

768
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:16,360
Let's go.

769
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:18,800
How's it going?

770
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:23,160
why're you still here?/ I can't... I can't swim.

771
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:24,640
I see...

772
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:26,949
Can't swim, huh?

773
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:55,069
Dave. Dave.

774
01:17:55,280 --> 01:18:01,196
Lizards. Get away from me.

775
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:07,799
Are you in a veibration
mode like a cell phone?

776
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:12,279
Get the body out./ I got it.

777
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:21,720
what's wrong with her?

778
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:25,040
I don't know. She was
trembling all of a sudden.

779
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:27,429
Maybe she's dead.

780
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:36,440
Don't leave me.

781
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:41,673
I don't need this. wait up please.

782
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:50,393
Stop chasing me around.

783
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:49,031
Hurry up!

784
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:54,800
I can't shut the door.

785
01:19:54,800 --> 01:20:01,956
The lizards are trying to
break in. Lizards. Lizards.

786
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:06,000
It's me! Dave. It's Dave.

787
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:09,360
I'm sorry. I thought you were a lizard.

788
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:10,120
Sorry.

789
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:15,399
Come on. Quick. Movee oveer.

790
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:52,239
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to. Are you hurt?

791
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:21,360
I think I know... who the
corpse in the coffin is.

792
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:23,555
who?

793
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:29,439
There he is.

794
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:34,760
No doubt about it. The
exact same gold teeth.

795
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:41,029
I knew it. This is the twist
ending... of a ghost film.

796
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:45,760
what's wrong with you guys?

797
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:50,000
Looks like you just saw a ghost.

798
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:55,711
He must not realize that he's already dead.

799
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Leave us alone, will you?

800
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:07,200
Stay in your own world./
Go to hell... or heaven.

801
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:09,998
Are you guys crazy?

802
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:14,393
I'm still alivee. why do you wish me death?

803
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:23,880
You are dead. Let's face it.
Everybody dies... it's inevitable.

804
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:25,472
That's right.

805
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:32,357
watch out!

806
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:43,033
Here... feel my heart. Is it still beating?

807
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:48,032
How can I be dead then?

808
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:53,960
why do you have gold teeth...
just like those in the corpse?

809
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:58,680
well, that's what wealthy people
do. They put gold in their teeth.

810
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:01,920
A twist ending, right?

811
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:04,960
Eat crow... you idiot.

812
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:10,680
This is not a moveie. This is reality.

813
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:14,560
Try to be optimistic about it.

814
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:17,640
So why are you here then?

815
01:23:17,640 --> 01:23:24,200
I heard some noise so I thought
there was a thief in here.

816
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:29,593
That's him. He freaked out
and screamed like a girl.

817
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:32,240
That's not true.

818
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:37,040
And why are you up this late?
Shouldn't you be home already?

819
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:39,080
How could we?

820
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:41,720
The lizards dragged the
corpse into the swamp...

821
01:23:41,720 --> 01:23:48,637
so the spirit took oveer Ji's body
and asked us to help bring it back.

822
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:51,400
See what I mean?

823
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:54,080
I told you.

824
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:58,915
Never insult these things
even if you don't believe it.

825
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:16,519
Come on.

826
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:19,040
Easy. Easy.

827
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:20,917
That's enough.

828
01:24:26,680 --> 01:24:28,600
Thanks, you guys.

829
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:33,120
You're not gonna go pay
respect to the corpse?

830
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:36,200
No, thanks. I'm actually in a hurry.

831
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:38,839
Some modeling work... you know?

832
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:46,308
Good luck, you guys.

833
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:49,040
Drivee carefully.

834
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:51,600
Bye.

835
01:24:54,400 --> 01:25:04,320
what about you guys? You're not coming?

836
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:06,436
Yes, we are.

837
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:09,270
You lead the way.

838
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:29,272
May your spirit and other spiritual
beings in this place rest in peace.

839
01:25:29,680 --> 01:25:32,520
If we did something offensivee to you...

840
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:41,920
be it veerbally, physically, or mentally
consciously or unconsciously.

841
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:49,110
May you please forgivee
us all for our mistakes.

842
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:14,672
Again?

843
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:17,920
Please leave her alone.

844
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:21,160
My sister is not a conveenience store...

845
01:26:21,160 --> 01:26:24,709
that anyone can veisit anytime of day.

846
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:33,599
Hey, she said she's forgiveen us all.

847
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:37,555
Nice!

848
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:40,640
Thank you so much.

849
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:46,400
The belief in the afterlife can
neither be explained logically...

850
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:48,920
nor proveen scientifically.

851
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:50,600
But for us...

852
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:56,789
we believe wholeheartedly... that it's real.

853
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:18,359
Excuse me.

854
01:27:22,240 --> 01:27:23,468
Can I help you?

855
01:27:24,120 --> 01:27:29,520
Unleaded gasoline... 20 bucks
please./ Just 20 bucks?

856
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:32,114
Open the lid.

857
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:40,517
what is this?/ It's a gas tank lid
opener. Do you know how to use it?

858
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:48,553
You think she's gonna
break my car?/ Possibly.

859
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:08,790
Are you tired?

860
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:16,280
You can take a nap. I'll wake
you up when we get there.

861
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:19,317
It's ok. I'm fine.

862
01:28:31,160 --> 01:28:33,435
It's for you.

863
01:28:34,440 --> 01:28:36,000
You don't want it anymore.

864
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:39,436
It's ok. I'vee got a few more back home.

865
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:46,470
Stay with him. Be a good boy.

866
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:01,033
Please don't cry.

867
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:07,960
I promise. I'll take you to veisit her often.

868
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:09,951
Smile.

869
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:19,639
Hi, dad. It's me. I'm coming home.

870
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:23,080
Hey, can you prepare the offerings for me?

871
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:26,320
It's too late now. Are you out of your mind?

872
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:29,800
Nope. I just miss grandpa. That's all.

873
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:33,440
Ok, then./ Ok.

874
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:36,432
I lovee you.

875
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:46,631
But I lovee you more.

876
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:50,998
Here.

877
01:30:22,840 --> 01:30:28,233
Back to where I was again.
will I ever get home tonight?

878
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:33,633
where are you going?

879
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:57,672
I'vee already told you that
when your boyfriend's away...

880
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:01,629
it's gonna be my day.

881
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:12,112
Come to papa.

882
01:31:18,280 --> 01:31:23,115
where're you going?
