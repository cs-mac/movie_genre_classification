  the United States government

He didn't give her anything.

179
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,388
It was a business loan.

180
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,425
        Well, according

        not a very good one.

181
00:11:00,427 --> 00:11:03,161
 Unfortunately,
 as we look at it, Dr. Travis,

182
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,997
       when a husband
       gives his wife money
       to start up a business,

183
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,266
        and that said business
        doesn't show a profit

         when she had the flu,

189

 Uh, but isn't it customary...

  me the initial down payment.
  $10,000.

                  7%.

199
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:46,971
       How much interest
       are you charging
       your wife, Dr. Travis?

200
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:53,578
     It's a hobby, Dr. Travis.

201
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,814
And that means that you owe
the United States government

202
00:11:55,816 --> 00:12:00,452
taxes on $36,532,
plus penalties and interest.

205
00:12:04,825 --> 00:12:06,391
               that it was
               a legitimate
               business loan.

206
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:09,661
  Oh, sure. Unless you can
  prove otherwise. Quickly.

Okay, I-- I'll admit it.
So maybe I was a lousy cook,

213
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:35,353

spent too much of
his money on clothes,

  Frank Lloyd Wrong.

Twice last month I fell asleep
when he was making love to me.

any reason to leave?

267
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,628
      How many drinks you have
      this evening, ma'am?

268
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:06,798
      What makes you think
      I've been drinking,

                  your license

Yeah, it's in my wallet.

00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,361

                that you, uh,

00:16:36,363 --> 00:16:39,430
            ran a stop sign
            back there on, uh,
            Main Street?

278
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:41,366

               give me a ticket?
               No.

279
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:44,202
        First, I'm just gonna
        ask you to do a little
        test for me.

280

         I'm gonna ask you
         to blow up a balloon.

Oh, I really don't wanna
blow up any balloons.

       put you under arrest,

00:22:14,534 --> 00:22:17,335
and I cashed it in,
I'd have nearly $2000.

397
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:19,837
        Why don't we
        just become hookers
        and rent a motel room?

398
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:24,008
We'd starve to death.
There's 12,000 college girls
in this town giving it away.

399
00:22:24,277 --> 00:22:29,513
       I know. We could kidnap
       Natalie and her husband
       would pay us $100,000

400
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:30,548
         not to send her back.

401
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:32,416
That's a good idea.

402
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:45,863
         My treat.

403
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:47,431
          Oh, thank you.

404
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:48,966
     Thank you, Louise.

405
00:22:48,968 --> 00:22:50,534
         Oh, I don't know.

406
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:54,438
   There's just got to be
   some way we can make money.

407
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,041
           We could
           make porno flicks
           and all wear masks.

408
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:59,210
No, Robert and I got
bombed out one night.

409
00:22:59,212 --> 00:23:02,046
We put a little "I love you"
tattoo on my ankle.

410
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:04,448
       Okay, we'll wear masks,
       you wear socks.

411
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,752
     Come on,
     let's get out of here.

412
00:23:07,754 --> 00:23:10,721
            What do you think
            about a doggie bag
            for the butter?

413
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:12,456
         Aw, the hell with it.

414
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,631
   No, Albert,
   I'm not in the mood.

415
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,401
               When will you
               be in the mood?

416
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:25,936
      Probably not
      for a long time.

417
00:23:25,938 --> 00:23:27,738
   I'm very depressed.

418
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,443
   Albert,
   I think I'm going
   to lose the store.

419
00:23:32,445 --> 00:23:35,980
       Louise, I swear to you,
       there is no money.

420
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,616
    If you only knew what is
    going on in that hospital.

421
00:23:38,618 --> 00:23:40,584
        It's not only the IRS.

422
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:42,753
            I'm in deep
            financial trouble,

423
00:23:42,954 --> 00:23:44,822
    and I need you to hold me,

424
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,158
        to hug me, to kiss me.

425
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:50,961
      To reassure me
      that everything isn't
      as hopeless as it looks.

426
00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:55,433
The only thing that's
hopeless, Albert, is that
you're horny 24 hours a day.

427
00:23:55,435 --> 00:24:00,638
 Prices aren't just going
 sky-high at gasoline stations
 and supermarkets, you know.

428
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,939
                The cost of
                medicine alone

429
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:03,441
          has tripled in
          the last five years.

430
00:24:03,443 --> 00:24:05,109
          Do you know what
          I did today, Louise?

431
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:06,177
                  Do you?

432
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:10,114
     I sold a used flea collar
     to a cocker spaniel. Yes!

433
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:12,116
             And tomorrow,
             I may remove
             a cat's appendix,

434
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:14,118
          whether he wants me
          to remove it or not!

435
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,953
             Why? Because
             I need the money!

436
00:24:16,321 --> 00:24:18,856
                No, baby,

                   I'm scared.

438

        I'm scared of
        what I'm turning into.

439
00:24:23,896 --> 00:24:25,830
          And I need the touch
          of the woman I love

440
00:24:25,832 --> 00:24:29,233
       to make me feel
       clean and decent again.

441

                 Your husband.

I thought you said
you wanted to have
a family.

466
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:54,752
           I could buy old man

00:25:57,223 --> 00:25:59,290
      That could be our store.

It's all my father's fault.

470

I could kill him for what
he did in World War II.

      Who, Max? The ex-Marine?

That's what he did wrong!

If we'd lost the dumb war,

475
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:14,605
then the Japanese

could've lent us

the $600 billion

the way we lent it
to them to rebuild theirs.

478

That way,
we would have the Sonys,
we would have the Toyotas,

and we would
have the Mercedes,

you were going to sue me?

      I was going to tell you.
      I was going to tell you.

       when the doorbell rang.

               I love you.
               You love me?

510
00:27:42,695 --> 00:27:44,261
       Yes. And I know
       how you must feel,

511
00:27:44,263 --> 00:27:45,696

        take it personally.

00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:30,207
                 He also said,

528
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:32,710
            "You can fool
            some of the people
            some of the time,

529
00:28:32,712 --> 00:28:35,412
           "but you can't fool
           all of the people
           all of the time."

530
00:28:35,414 --> 00:28:36,547
    He also said,

531
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:40,451
"With malice toward none,
and charity to all."

532
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,554
         And the last thing
         he said, Albert, was,

533
00:28:43,556 --> 00:28:46,557
     "Look, honey, I've got
     these two great seats
     for the theater tonight."

534
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,826
Why did I
bring up Lincoln?

535
00:28:48,828 --> 00:28:51,562
     Louise, come back.
     I love you!

536
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:52,896
                  LOUISE:
                  Kiss my ass!

537
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:54,898
 Right! I wanna make up!

      (CAR HORN HONKING)

539
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,912
     How you doing,
     Miss Houghton?
     Hi, Mike.

540
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:13,917
 Jesus, nine cents
 more from last week.
 That's incredible!

541
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,352
         Well, it's not us.

542
00:29:15,354 --> 00:29:20,591
 I'm still making the same
 amount of money on a gallon
 of gasoline as I did in 1958.

543
00:29:20,593 --> 00:29:22,693
 You must've made
 a bundle in '58.

544
00:29:22,695 --> 00:29:23,794
I'll switch to regular.

545
00:29:23,796 --> 00:29:25,763
         No, I'm sorry, ma'am,
         you can't do that.

546
00:29:25,765 --> 00:29:27,631
           See, your car
           takes lead-free.

547
00:29:27,633 --> 00:29:31,668
    The regular gas,
    the nozzle's too big.
    It won't fit in your tank.

548
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:34,872
  Well, shove it in.
  Use Vaseline if you have to.

549
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:41,011
No, you see,
the idea is to keep
your car free from pollutants.

550
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,193
(SQUEAKING)

551
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:03,400
I'm sorry, Mrs. Houghton,

552
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:06,804
but, your, uh,
card's been cancelled.

553
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:09,640
What?
Yeah, it-- it's
in the new book.

554
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:11,241
Well, here, let me see...
Oh, oh, oh!

555
00:30:11,243 --> 00:30:13,877
I can't let you have it.
It's a $25 reward.

556
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:21,752
     Mike,
     did I mention that
     my husband's out of town?

557
00:30:21,754 --> 00:30:23,587
I heard he ran away
with his secretary.

558
00:30:23,589 --> 00:30:24,888
             (CHUCKLING) Yeah.

559
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:27,424
         Do you know
         what that does to
         a woman's confidence?

560
00:30:27,426 --> 00:30:30,160
No, but it sure does
lousy things to her credit.

561
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:37,868
        A girl needs a strong,
        virile man

562
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:40,938
     to help her get back
     into the swing, you know?

563
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,607
You know, Mrs. Houghton,

564
00:30:43,609 --> 00:30:46,510
I have no respect for a woman
who does it for money.

565
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:48,412
    Let alone gasoline.

566
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:52,349
      How much do I owe you?
      73 cents.

567
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:54,284
       I'll write you a check.

568
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,023
           I don't believe it!

569
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:02,926
        Mom threw you out
        and moved a friend in?

570
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:04,294
                       When?

571
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:08,265
This afternoon,
1320 hours.

572
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:09,967
              What's his name?

573
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:11,969
His name?

574
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:16,540
His name is Shirley.

575
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:23,714
That's right, your mother,
age 64, has joined the Sun
City Gay Liberation Movement.

576
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,452
       But that's impossible.

577
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:31,555
           All I ever remember
           Mom telling me was

578
00:31:31,557 --> 00:31:35,792
    how much she loved you
    and--and that she would
    never look at another man.

579
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:39,630
     Of course, she never did
     mention another woman.

580
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:42,900
          What about you, Dad?

581
00:31:42,902 --> 00:31:44,902
               Have you always
               been faithful?

582
00:31:44,904 --> 00:31:49,740
Oh, baby, <i> Semper Fidelis,</i>
ever faithful.

583
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:53,744
In the Marines or in
the bedroom, 36 years.

584
00:31:54,178 --> 00:31:58,982
Well, now, where can I bunk
till this crazy broad decides
to go straight again?

585
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:03,654
      There's a lovely little
      Holiday Inn right around
      the corner.

586
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:06,356
Oh, honey,
come on, now, give...

587
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:11,328
Give the old sarge
a--a second choice?
Hmm?

588
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,869
     Maybe you could stay here
     with me and the kids.

589
00:32:18,871 --> 00:32:20,871
Hey, that's a great idea!

590
00:32:20,873 --> 00:32:22,105
Yeah,
I'd be like a father.

591
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:23,707
  I'll teach 'em
  everything I know.

592
00:32:23,709 --> 00:32:26,109
What's-- What's
the battle plan?

593
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:27,444
          Dad, do you remember
          that old couch

594
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:28,979
           from Camp Pendleton
           that you and Mom

595
00:32:28,981 --> 00:32:30,614
          gave me and Tom
          when we got married?

596
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:31,949
        It's still in the den.

597
00:32:31,951 --> 00:32:35,619
Oh, Pendleton, the...
Oh, yeah.

598
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:38,956
Oh, do I remember that.
Where are the blankets
and the sheets?

599
00:32:38,958 --> 00:32:40,624
              The hall closet,
              top shelf.

600
00:32:40,626 --> 00:32:43,527
Hall closet, top shelf.
Aye, aye, Captain.

601
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:47,731
Hey, don't look so worried.

602
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:51,001
It'll only be
a little while.

603
00:32:51,003 --> 00:32:53,236
   I... I'll stay
   out of your way.

604
00:32:53,238 --> 00:32:55,305
 You won't even know I'm here.

605
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:56,873
   And, uh, uh...

606
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:00,811
I'll keep my mouth shut.

607
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:04,214
                Okay, Dad.

608
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:19,997
Hi, Fred.
Is there something
I can help you with?

609
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:25,369
Wait, don't tell me,
it's Aggie's birthday
this Sunday, isn't it?

610
00:33:25,371 --> 00:33:27,604
        I'm gonna have to take
        these from you,
        Mrs. Travis.

611
00:33:27,606 --> 00:33:30,040
(CHUCKLING)
Oh, Fred, I mean,
you can't take anything.

612
00:33:30,042 --> 00:33:31,441
You have to pay for it.

613
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:37,681
You know, this is an authentic
19th-century English
jailer's ring.

614
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,684

here somewhere.

658
00:37:57,209 --> 00:38:00,543
          how to get into it,
          how to get the money
          out of it

659
00:38:00,545 --> 00:38:02,946
         and how to get away
         without being caught.

660
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:06,616
     Come on, Louise, think.
     There's got to be some
     way to get to that money.

661
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:09,386
              LOUISE:
              Only one way.
              From underneath.

662
00:38:09,388 --> 00:38:13,556
    We'd have to dig a tunnel
    from the bank of the river
    to under here.

663
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:17,294
        Then once we got here,
        we'd still have to
        figure out a way

664
00:38:17,296 --> 00:38:20,630
  to cut a hole
  up through the floor
  and get the money out of it.

665
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:22,866
     God, it's gonna be tough.

666
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:25,468
      Let's take a walk,
      okay?

667
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:32,976
          Why are you being
          so negative, Louise?

668
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:35,845
I'm not being negative,
I'm being realistic.

669
00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:38,315
I mean, one,
how do we do it?

670
00:38:38,317 --> 00:38:41,484
I mean, we've gotta plan
this out, step by step.

671
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:46,156
Two, if there is a way,
can we do it?

672
00:38:46,158 --> 00:38:47,857
I mean, are we
gutty enough to do it?

673
00:38:47,859 --> 00:38:49,693
    Oh, look, if men
    are gutty enough to
    do it, I don't see why...

674
00:38:49,695 --> 00:38:52,429
Men are gutty enough
in the movies, Elaine.
In the movies.

675
00:38:52,431 --> 00:38:54,764
I mean,
where in real life
did you ever see,

676
00:38:54,766 --> 00:38:56,666
hear or read
about anybody

677
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:58,168
getting away with it?

678
00:38:58,170 --> 00:38:59,936
           The Brinks Robbery,
           Miami Beach!

679
00:38:59,938 --> 00:39:04,841
It was Boston, and once
they caught one of 'em,
he confessed in five minutes.

680
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:07,777
The other seven are doing
10 years-to-life.

681
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:12,115
It'll be tough.

682
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:20,056
I'll be in charge of
phase one of the operation,

683
00:39:20,058 --> 00:39:25,762
Elaine, you be in charge
of phase two, execution,
if we ever get that far.

684
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:28,198
             What should I do?

685
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,066
          I--I don't know.
          Besides getting
          knocked up,

686
00:39:30,068 --> 00:39:31,801
        what's your specialty?

687
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:35,472
    Hey, I--I am an expert
    in one area.

688
00:39:35,474 --> 00:39:37,040
   I mean, I don't know
   if it'll do us any good,

689
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:39,809
    but you never know
    with the river nearby.

690
00:39:39,811 --> 00:39:43,046
        What's that?
        I can row a canoe.

691
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:46,316
That is my specialty.
I was canoe counselor at camp.

692
00:39:46,318 --> 00:39:50,787
  We used to get into
  these canoes at night
  and sing old Indian songs.

693
00:39:51,088 --> 00:39:55,225
     ♪ Oh, the moon shines
     on the pretty red wing

694
00:39:55,227 --> 00:39:57,260
    ♪ The breezes sighing

695
00:39:57,262 --> 00:39:59,295
   ♪ The red birds cry... ♪

696
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:03,133
 I canoe better than I sing.

697
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,304
I mean, there it was.

698
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,774
Is that incredible?

699
00:40:10,776 --> 00:40:13,176
        Wait a minute, Elaine,
        say that again.

700
00:40:13,178 --> 00:40:14,577
           We don't have
           to dig a tunnel?

701
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:18,114
<i>I just found Millard's plans</i>
<i>for the shopping center</i>
<i>and guess what?</i>

702
00:40:18,116 --> 00:40:20,083
They done dug one for us.

703
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,485
       I know.

704
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:27,757
Uh, operator, if he's not
at the Howard Johnson's
Motor Lodge in Omaha,

705
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:32,162
try the one in San Diego,
and if he's not there,
try the one in Denver.

706
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,931
Millard loves
their ice cream.

707
00:40:35,466 --> 00:40:37,167
    Thank you.

708
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:40,770
Richard, you're his partner.
Where'd he go?

709
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:42,972
            Oh, I wish I knew.

710
00:40:42,974 --> 00:40:44,941
           You know,
           that son of a bitch
           still owes me $20

711
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:47,544
      on the Oregon State-
      S.C. game last Saturday?

712
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,447
     And what brings you here?

713
00:40:50,449 --> 00:40:51,848
        The truth?

714
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:55,485
The truth is I'm trying
to get this drawer unlocked.

715
00:40:55,487 --> 00:40:58,488
Millard always kept
some dimes in here
for the parking meter.

716
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:01,791
         Elaine, what's really
         in that drawer?

717
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:05,962
      I don't know,
      but it's locked,

718
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:07,797
   so it must be
   something interesting.

719
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:10,400
         Oh, yeah? Let me try.

720
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:12,735
           Okay.

721
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:16,072
         Let's see. Let's see.

722
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,589
            Okay, this is
            the conveyor belt.

723
00:41:32,591 --> 00:41:34,591
      The garbage runs
      along the conveyor belt.

724
00:41:34,593 --> 00:41:37,026
           It goes all the way
           behind the stores

725
00:41:37,028 --> 00:41:40,196
        down here to the river
        where it's picked up
        by a barge.

726
00:41:40,198 --> 00:41:44,067
           This is the tunnel.
           It goes all the way
           to there.

727
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:47,170
        Oh, this is gonna
        be scary.

728
00:41:47,172 --> 00:41:49,772
          I've never
          stolen anything
          in my entire life.

729
00:41:49,774 --> 00:41:51,508
You stole my notes
for the Latin final.

730
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:53,176
        That doesn't count.
        I got a D on that.

731
00:41:53,178 --> 00:41:56,179
              Jane, this time,
              we've got to get
              an A, all right?

732
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:57,747
                         I know.
                         An A.

733
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:01,351
You realize
that we're talking about
nearly a million dollars here?

734
00:42:01,353 --> 00:42:04,187
  Okay, look.
  Here's where
  the Money Ball is,

735
00:42:04,189 --> 00:42:06,856
right above the central
air conditioning unit.

736
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:08,124
         That's the closest
         store there.

00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:33,122
  That means
  the overhead theater lights,
  the mall and the Money Ball.

786
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:36,125
       I can plunge the entire
       shopping center into
       total darkness

787
00:46:36,127 --> 00:46:38,528
                with one flip
                of the switch.

788
00:46:38,996 --> 00:46:40,463
        (ALL CHEERING)

789
00:46:40,465 --> 00:46:43,533
      Attaboy, Billy!
      Two more runs batted in!

790
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:48,805
Now all we have to do
is figure out how to get

791
00:46:48,807 --> 00:46:50,139
the money
out of the Money Ball.

792
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:51,374
                        Yeah.

793
00:46:52,743 --> 00:46:56,145
         Stop at third!
         Stop at third,
         you dummy!

794
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:59,081
MAN: Get it!
Yeah, get it!
Come on! Yeah!

795
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:02,652
                   You're out!

796
00:47:02,654 --> 00:47:05,087
    No way!
    I slid under the tag!

797
00:47:05,422 --> 00:47:06,856
     You blind son of a bitch!

798
00:47:06,858 --> 00:47:09,492
   He tagged him in the thigh,
   you friggin' idiot!

799
00:47:09,494 --> 00:47:10,860
         I saw <i> Bad News Bears.</i>

800
00:47:10,862 --> 00:47:12,762
      I thought that was
      the way the kids talked.

801
00:47:12,764 --> 00:47:14,997
 Nobody calls
 my son out when he has
 only one more home run to win

802
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:16,599
  for the League Championship!

803
00:47:16,601 --> 00:47:19,502
         Do you understand me,
         you old fart? Do you?

804
00:47:21,438 --> 00:47:22,705
       MaHaney,

805
00:47:22,707 --> 00:47:27,276
I have been
wanting to do this
for the past five years.

806
00:47:27,278 --> 00:47:28,377
                 (GRUNTS)

807
00:47:28,379 --> 00:47:30,913
That's for touching
an umpire!

808
00:47:31,548 --> 00:47:32,882
                (GROANS)

809
00:47:32,884 --> 00:47:35,451
And that's for
leaving my daughter!

810
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:39,055
                And that's
                for making me
                lose my temper

811
00:47:39,057 --> 00:47:40,723
             in front of
             these sweet kids,

812
00:47:40,725 --> 00:47:43,626
  you chicken-shit wimp!

813
00:47:44,394 --> 00:47:47,029
How much did you say
you needed for Robert?

814
00:47:47,031 --> 00:47:49,298
                $25,000.

815
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:53,603
      Plus a down payment
      for an apartment in
      Sun City for Max Hitler.

816
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:57,073
             $10,000 more.
             $35,000.

817
00:47:57,075 --> 00:47:58,241
                      $36,000.

818
00:47:58,243 --> 00:48:00,443
         You'll need $1,000
         for Tom's bridgework.

819
00:48:00,911 --> 00:48:02,378
         He'll definitely sue.

820
00:48:03,146 --> 00:48:05,581
Phase two
is now in effect.

821
00:48:05,583 --> 00:48:08,551
Now that we know that
it's physically possible
for us to be thieves,

822
00:48:08,553 --> 00:48:11,220
we've gotta
find out if it's
psychologically possible.

823
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:12,989
                You first, Jane.
                Me?

824
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:34,911
     Stick up a Safeway alone?

825
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,848
           Why not? I mean,
           everybody knows me,

826
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:40,249
            the checkers,
            the managers,

827
00:48:40,251 --> 00:48:42,685
  even the box boys wave at me
  when I come in.

828
00:48:42,687 --> 00:48:45,655
  "Hey, here comes
  the old coupon queen again!"

829
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:48,090
I meant the one
in Medford.

830
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:53,796
Don't say anything,
just point.

831
00:48:53,798 --> 00:48:54,931
                 Is that real?

832
00:48:54,933 --> 00:48:57,199
No, it's a model
Millard made 15 years ago

833
00:48:57,201 --> 00:48:58,701
when he was an Eagle Scout.

834
00:48:58,703 --> 00:49:00,870
With a real gun,
you do 5-to-10.

835
00:49:00,872 --> 00:49:02,838
With that one,
1-to-5.

836
00:49:03,707 --> 00:49:05,174
               Thanks, Elaine.

837
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:34,070
    The least
    you could do is
    say you're sorry.

838
00:49:34,072 --> 00:49:36,839
         It's been 15 minutes.
         I told her to only
         get a few things.

839
00:49:36,841 --> 00:49:38,574
               What the hell
               is keeping her?

                 Steak, $8.95.

842
00:49:49,086 --> 00:49:51,988
            Grape-Nuts, $1.26,

843
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:53,823
               cookies, $1.43,

      ELAINE: Well, at least
      you didn't get arrested.

850
00:50:11,376 --> 00:50:14,944
JANE:
No, not until the $285 check
I wrote for the food bounces.

851
00:50:14,946 --> 00:50:17,780
          That was last night.
          I'm in charge today.

852
00:50:25,722 --> 00:50:27,690
Oh! God, I'm so sorry.

853
00:50:27,692 --> 00:50:29,225
      I'm so sorry.

854
00:50:29,227 --> 00:50:32,795
I'm such a klutz.
I don't believe it.

855
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:35,431
  Here, let me help you.
  Here.

856

    Oh, thank you.
    I'm so sorry.

I was surprised.

   in that river is a bitch!

863
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:37,827
          ELAINE: How the hell
          are we gonna empty
          that big ball?

00:52:05,623 --> 00:52:07,790

           got two days to go,

We're psychologically
testing ourselves by
robbing Wheeler's,

       I left those two alone,

   Billy took nude pictures
   of Laurie with his Polaroid

881

       Robert's keys?

887
00:53:17,662 --> 00:53:19,862
         Last night.
         How did you do that?

888
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:22,665
       They were in his pants,
       he wasn't.

Ah, the old
backseat of the car
in the garage, eh?

890
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:28,804
           No, we had to give
           that up ever since
           my father moved in.

891
00:53:28,806 --> 00:53:30,306

Foreplay heaven.

893
00:53:31,509 --> 00:53:32,708
            It's still cheaper
            than a motel.

894
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:34,476

   Where's the vacuum
   cleaner?

00:54:40,544 --> 00:54:41,877
                  Hurry up.

915
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:52,154
(EXCLAIMS)
Hold it!

916
00:54:52,722 --> 00:54:54,657
  What's goin' on here?

917
00:54:54,659 --> 00:54:58,460
           Uh, listen,
           it's not gonna
           be easy to explain.

918
00:54:58,762 --> 00:55:00,729
Suppose you try, little lady.

919
00:55:00,731 --> 00:55:01,797
              Ah, yes.

920
00:55:02,565 --> 00:55:04,733
         Maybe we all
         better give it a try.

921
00:55:08,672 --> 00:55:10,739
Why don't we
just tell the truth?

922
00:55:10,741 --> 00:55:13,509
Elaine, tell the officer
the truth.

923
00:55:14,577 --> 00:55:15,844
                       Right.

924
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:17,212
                       Uh...

925
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:21,817
     <i> (OFFICER CHATTERING</i>
     <i> ON POLICE RADIO)</i>

926
00:55:23,019 --> 00:55:25,754
     It's a game.
     It's a scavenger
     hunt for charity.

927
00:55:25,756 --> 00:55:28,657
     Oh, God, not you again.

928
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:32,127
Jack, how sweet
of you to remember.

929
00:55:32,129 --> 00:55:33,662
             Hold it!

930
00:55:34,597 --> 00:55:36,632
Jack, I haven't
had a drink in a week.

931
00:55:36,634 --> 00:55:40,736
    Maybe tonight I don't
    get slugged in the head
    with a purse, huh?

932
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:42,771
    You know,
    I've gotta report this.

933
00:55:42,773 --> 00:55:45,040
Jack, can't you
bend the rules a little?

934
00:55:45,042 --> 00:55:47,109
I mean,
it's not like
we were stealing.

935
00:55:47,111 --> 00:55:48,811
All this stuff came from...

936
00:55:48,813 --> 00:55:50,946
Came from
Jane's fiance's
hardware store.

937
00:55:50,948 --> 00:55:52,815
He's the manager.
Isn't that right, Jane?

938
00:55:52,817 --> 00:55:54,783
        Oh, right, absolutely.

939
00:55:54,785 --> 00:55:56,952
      Robert Logan.
      See, these are his keys.

940
00:55:56,954 --> 00:55:58,954
   Wheeler's Hardware Store.
   Wheeler's. This is the key.

941
00:55:58,956 --> 00:56:00,856
      Look, she even
      brought her kids.

942
00:56:00,858 --> 00:56:02,825
      Would anybody
      in their right minds

943
00:56:02,827 --> 00:56:04,660
       bring their kids
       to a robbery?

944
00:56:04,662 --> 00:56:05,928
                       Really.

945
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:20,075
 Jack, if you turn us in,
 we'll look like imbeciles.

946
00:56:20,077 --> 00:56:21,744
  Robert will yell at Jane,

947
00:56:21,746 --> 00:56:23,846
    Louise will catch
    hell from Albert,

948
00:56:23,848 --> 00:56:24,947
           and I'll...

949
00:56:25,749 --> 00:56:26,815
           I'll, um...

950
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:28,917
           How about you?

951
00:56:28,919 --> 00:56:32,721
Well, I don't have anybody
to holler at me, not anymore.

952
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:35,624
Forget you ever saw us,
okay?

953
00:56:36,593 --> 00:56:37,993
      I don't know about this.

954
00:56:37,995 --> 00:56:39,561
      I'll owe you one.

955
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:41,230
          You'll owe me two.

956
00:56:41,698 --> 00:56:42,831
          Whatever.

957
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:45,768
   Look, I was drunk
   the other night,

958
00:56:45,770 --> 00:56:48,504
       my husband just
       walked out on me.
       I was crazed.

959
00:56:48,506 --> 00:56:52,007
I didn't know
what I was saying.
I know what I'm saying now.

960
00:56:52,009 --> 00:56:55,177
   Ask Louise.
   I've-- I've known
   her since high school.

961
00:56:55,179 --> 00:56:56,945
Louise, do I ever
go back on my word?

962
00:56:57,213 --> 00:56:58,947
          Does she ever
          go back on her word?

963
00:57:00,116 --> 00:57:01,917
                        Never.

964
00:57:06,189 --> 00:57:07,756
           Thank you.

965
00:57:10,627 --> 00:57:12,561
       God, three martinis
       and it doesn't help.

966
00:57:12,563 --> 00:57:14,263
    I still feel like a tramp.

967
00:57:15,031 --> 00:57:18,867
     Did you see me
     practically rape that
     policeman on the street?

968
00:57:18,869 --> 00:57:20,736
Lainie, I'm sorry
about the burglar alarm.

969
00:57:20,738 --> 00:57:22,971
I mean,
I just sort of panicked
when I saw Billy bouncing...

970
00:57:22,973 --> 00:57:25,974
That's just it, Jane.
Professionals don't panic.

971
00:57:25,976 --> 00:57:27,042
       Oh, cut it out, Elaine.

972
00:57:27,044 --> 00:57:28,811
    If there's one thing
    we can do without tonight,

973
00:57:28,813 --> 00:57:31,814
           it's your superior,
           bitchy attitude.

974
00:57:31,816 --> 00:57:33,816
       Louise, please.
       No name-calling.

975
00:57:33,818 --> 00:57:35,884
    I can't stand it
    when my friends fight.

976
00:57:36,085 --> 00:57:38,120
I didn't call her a name.
"Bitch" is not a name?

977
00:57:38,122 --> 00:57:39,655
    I said, "bitchy attitude."

978
00:57:39,657 --> 00:57:41,223
Oh, don't try
and apologize, Louise.

979
00:57:41,225 --> 00:57:43,292
I take it
from where it comes.

980
00:57:43,294 --> 00:57:46,361
         Elaine, what's really
         bothering you?

981
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:48,897
        I'm scared.

982
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,167
       Jane, I'm sorry.

983
00:57:53,837 --> 00:57:56,638
  Oh, Jesus, I don't know
  what's the matter with me.

984
00:57:58,942 --> 00:58:00,709
           Yes, I do.

985
00:58:02,245 --> 00:58:04,746
        I'm coming apart
        at the seams.

986
00:58:07,116 --> 00:58:10,619
        I'm a totally
        unloved, unglued,

987
00:58:10,621 --> 00:58:12,187
       totally rejected
       basket case.

988
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:27,002
               Good night.

989
00:58:38,281 --> 00:58:39,348
                     Hi.

990
00:58:40,783 --> 00:58:42,885
I thought it might be you.

991
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:47,789
          I just, uh,
          wanted to make sure
          you got home safely.

992
00:58:48,057 --> 00:58:49,958
How's your wife?

993
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,394
                    Well, uh,

994
00:58:52,996 --> 00:58:54,329
     you may not believe this.

995
00:58:54,331 --> 00:58:56,965
         I mean,
         a man of my charm
         and, uh, sensitivity,

996
00:58:56,967 --> 00:58:58,867
         but, uh, she left me.

997
00:59:01,237 --> 00:59:03,705
              Can I buy you
              a cup of coffee?

998
00:59:04,974 --> 00:59:06,375
      No.

999
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:11,713
But you,
uh, can come in
and I'll make you one.

1000
00:59:11,981 --> 00:59:13,782
                That's a deal.

1001
00:59:18,154 --> 00:59:19,888
   I don't know.

1002
00:59:20,857 --> 00:59:24,259
You put on your "A woman
needs a man like a fish
needs a bicycle" T-shirt,

1003
00:59:24,261 --> 00:59:27,062
and you poke away
at him year after year,

1004
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:29,998
needling him
with a vengeance.

1005
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,233
And then one day
he trades you in

1006
00:59:31,235 --> 00:59:34,002
on someone with
a softer voice and skin.

1007
00:59:35,338 --> 00:59:37,172
So here I am.

1008
00:59:37,174 --> 00:59:41,343
Waking up alone every morning
and it's the pits, Jack,
it really is.

1009
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:45,213
           Come on, let's go.

1010
00:59:45,215 --> 00:59:46,481
      Where?

1011
00:59:47,016 --> 00:59:48,483
              The bedroom.

1012
00:59:49,686 --> 00:59:51,687
 No, I don't think so.

1013
00:59:51,689 --> 00:59:52,955
                  Why not?

1014
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:55,924
       Well...

1015
00:59:59,128 --> 01:00:00,796
              You know, I'm...

1016
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:04,433
     I'm not real good
     at explaining how I feel,

1017
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:08,770
            but when
            I saw you tonight,

1018
01:00:12,141 --> 01:00:15,844
    my--my throat was dry.
    I--I could barely breathe.

1019
01:00:17,046 --> 01:00:19,114
      I--I thought you felt...

1020
01:00:21,751 --> 01:00:24,820
  Well, what now...
  What is it you want, anyway?

1021
01:00:24,988 --> 01:00:28,056
       A neurosurgeon
       or a stockbroker
       or something like that?

1022
01:00:28,058 --> 01:00:31,126
No, Jack,
it has nothing to
do with economics.

1023
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:34,930
I'd go to bed
with a garbage collector
if he said the right thing.

1024
01:00:34,932 --> 01:00:38,133
     All--All I know is
     that I'm crazy about you.

1025
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:43,739
          I would like to
          hold you in my arms,

1026
01:00:43,741 --> 01:00:46,174
         I'd like to make love
         to you all night.

1027
01:00:48,911 --> 01:00:50,479
           And in the morning,

1028
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:52,781
    while you're still asleep,

1029
01:00:52,783 --> 01:00:55,117
           I'd like to go down
           to the kitchen,

1030
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:57,319
         make the orange juice
         and coffee

1031
01:00:59,088 --> 01:01:00,922
          and bring it to you.

1032
01:01:04,927 --> 01:01:06,995
 You said the right thing.

1033
01:01:08,097 --> 01:01:10,165
              And you won't
              be disappointed.

1034
01:01:18,441 --> 01:01:19,875
              Which way?

1035
01:01:19,877 --> 01:01:21,043
        Not here.

1036
01:01:21,045 --> 01:01:22,277
               Why not?

1037
01:01:22,279 --> 01:01:23,445
          Well,

1038
01:01:24,313 --> 01:01:27,182
a lot of
neighbors wondering
why there's a police car

1039
01:01:27,184 --> 01:01:29,551
   parked in my driveway
   all night.

1040
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:31,453
                Smart lady.

1041
01:01:31,455 --> 01:01:33,221
       A private one.

1042
01:01:46,335 --> 01:01:48,537
CHARLOTTE:
It's not your fault, Albert.

1043
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:52,441
Two careers in a family
are almost impossible.

1044
01:01:52,809 --> 01:01:56,378
Unless the woman is
in the same business
as her husband.

1045
01:01:57,013 --> 01:01:59,581
Like a doctor
and his nurse.

1046
01:02:00,249 --> 01:02:03,151
      ALBERT: It's not easy
      to be married to Louise.

1047
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:04,886
    When I met her in college,

1048
01:02:04,888 --> 01:02:06,922
        a chili dog and a coke
        made her happy.

1049
01:02:07,924 --> 01:02:10,225
        Doing her own thing
        meant baking me
        chocolate chip cookies

1050
01:02:10,227 --> 01:02:11,893
          every Sunday morning

1051
01:02:11,895 --> 01:02:15,497
   after we spent Friday night
   and all day Saturday
   in the sack.

1052
01:02:16,999 --> 01:02:20,268
You know what I used to do
during the first years of
my marriage to Conrad?

1053
01:02:20,270 --> 01:02:21,169
                  No.

1054
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:23,338
After we'd make love,

1055
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:25,107
   I'd get out of bed,

1056
01:02:25,441 --> 01:02:27,342
  go into the bathroom,

1057
01:02:27,344 --> 01:02:29,478
soak a towel in warm water,

1058
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:33,148
come back to bed
and wash him off.

1059
01:02:34,283 --> 01:02:36,384
That's the difference
between a European

1060
01:02:36,386 --> 01:02:38,186
and an American woman,
Albert.

1061
01:02:38,188 --> 01:02:41,089
You can buy
chocolate chip cookies
in a supermarket, Albert.

1062
01:02:41,091 --> 01:02:42,991
           No, not like these.

1063
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:46,128
        She used to put nuts
        and raisins into them.

1064
01:02:47,196 --> 01:02:49,331
           And now she's gone.

1065
01:02:49,899 --> 01:02:52,100
   Moved into the den forever.

1066
01:02:53,569 --> 01:02:55,437
         Where did I go wrong?

1067
01:02:55,872 --> 01:02:58,039
It's not your fault, Albert.

1068
01:02:58,908 --> 01:03:01,943
But let's not talk
about her anymore tonight.

1069
01:03:02,411 --> 01:03:05,947
It's taken me seven years
just to get you up here.

1070
01:03:06,382 --> 01:03:07,983
                No, don't.

1071
01:03:08,551 --> 01:03:11,553
   It wouldn't be fair to you.
   I still love her.

1072
01:03:12,255 --> 01:03:14,356
             You're a very
             attractive woman.

1073
01:03:18,561 --> 01:03:21,363
     And I'm getting,
     I admit, very turned on.

1074
01:03:22,231 --> 01:03:25,000
      But we'll hate ourselves
      in the morning.

1075
01:03:25,334 --> 01:03:28,036
Oh, I could never
hate myself for this.

1076
01:03:35,077 --> 01:03:36,645
       Did you really
       get out of bed in
       the middle of the night

1077
01:03:36,647 --> 01:03:38,346
               and get a warm,
               wet towel?

1078
01:03:38,348 --> 01:03:39,581
            Yes.

1079
01:03:39,583 --> 01:03:41,516
        I think I'd like that.

1080
01:03:41,518 --> 01:03:44,152
 Mmm, I know you would.

1081
01:03:47,423 --> 01:03:51,526
   But there are
   no wet, warm towels
   up on this hill, Charlotte.

1082
01:03:51,994 --> 01:03:53,562
Oh, we'll work
something out, Albert.

1083
01:03:57,433 --> 01:03:59,334
ROBERT: I'm four days
away from losing my job,

1084
01:03:59,336 --> 01:04:02,003
and you're still talking
about having a baby.

1085
01:04:02,005 --> 01:04:03,338
Jane, I love you, but...

1086
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:05,006
          Robert, you're not
          gonna lose your job.

1087
01:04:05,008 --> 01:04:07,409
             I'm gonna get you
             the $25,000.

1088
01:04:07,610 --> 01:04:10,278
      We're gonna get married,
      and then I'm gonna...
      Where?

1089
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:12,614
Where are you gonna
get that kind of money?

1090
01:04:12,616 --> 01:04:14,382
               From my family.

1091
01:04:14,617 --> 01:04:16,618
Jane, your father
borrowed $10 from me

1092
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:18,486
when I came to
pick you up last night.

1093
01:04:18,488 --> 01:04:20,755
               Well, not him.
               From my mother.

1094
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:25,227
Your mother is living
with a lady named Shirley.

1095
01:04:25,229 --> 01:04:27,162
They've adopted
a black baby.

1096
01:04:27,164 --> 01:04:30,298
Last week she hocked her
wedding ring to buy a crib.

1097
01:04:31,634 --> 01:04:33,969
ELAINE: Why did this
have to happen to me?

1098
01:04:33,971 --> 01:04:36,171
     JACK: How did you
     get your foot caught
     in the glove compartment?

1099
01:04:36,173 --> 01:04:37,572
I don't know.

1100
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:40,075
     We'll have to call
     the damn Fire Department.

1101
01:04:40,077 --> 01:04:41,309
 Oh, forget
 the Fire Department.

1102
01:04:41,311 --> 01:04:43,044
  I need a crowbar.

1103
01:04:43,312 --> 01:04:46,248
           Crowbar.
           That's a good idea.

1104
01:04:52,421 --> 01:04:54,489
        You wait here. Well...

1105
01:04:54,657 --> 01:04:56,725
  <i> (MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO)</i>

1106
01:04:59,495 --> 01:05:01,263
    Whoops. Sorry.

1107
01:05:12,174 --> 01:05:13,408
Excuse me, sir.

1108
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:15,677
Uh, you wouldn't happen
to have a crowbar

1109
01:05:15,679 --> 01:05:18,747
or maybe a little heavy-duty,
uh, screwdriver?

1110
01:05:35,398 --> 01:05:37,365
       Robert, is that Albert?

1111
01:05:37,733 --> 01:05:39,467
 It can't be Albert.

1112
01:05:39,469 --> 01:05:43,104
  I mean, if it were
  your dog's foot,
  I'd know what to do.

1113
01:05:43,106 --> 01:05:45,740
       Yeah, but what would
       I be doin' up here
       with a dog?

1114
01:05:45,742 --> 01:05:47,442
             It is too Albert.

1115
01:05:47,444 --> 01:05:49,377
But that's not Louise.

1116
01:05:49,379 --> 01:05:50,812
                   Come on.

1117
01:05:51,547 --> 01:05:53,315
   I found a vet.

1118
01:05:54,383 --> 01:05:55,817
              Hi--Hi, Albert.

1119
01:05:56,385 --> 01:05:57,686
    Elaine?

1120
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:01,456
                   Hi, Jane.
                   Oh, my God.

1121
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:02,724
Is that you, Jane?

1122
01:06:02,726 --> 01:06:07,462
I'm trying to
get your best friend's foot
out of this glove compartment

1123
01:06:07,464 --> 01:06:12,567
I only hope the two of you
remember that the next time
you see you-know-who.

1124
01:06:12,569 --> 01:06:14,402
           He means his wife.
           Shut up, Charlotte.

1125
01:06:14,404 --> 01:06:17,405
           It won't come out.
           How did you get it
           in there like that?

1126
01:06:17,407 --> 01:06:19,441
          Look on page 62
          of the <i> Kama Sutra.</i>

1127
01:06:19,443 --> 01:06:20,642
           (SCREAMING)

1128
01:06:20,644 --> 01:06:22,444
       Take it easy, baby.
       Take it easy.

1129
01:06:22,446 --> 01:06:24,079
  Jack? Hi.

1130
01:06:24,081 --> 01:06:26,348
      Jane?
      You two know each other?

1131
01:06:26,582 --> 01:06:28,750
              How does he know
              your name?

1132
01:06:30,519 --> 01:06:33,688
Will someone
please get my foot out of
the goddamn glove compartment?

1133
01:06:33,690 --> 01:06:35,357
        Here, I'll get it out.

1134
01:06:35,359 --> 01:06:38,493
        My children get in
        more trouble than this
        every five minutes.

1135
01:06:38,495 --> 01:06:40,261
    (GROANING)
    Just turn a little there.

1136
01:06:40,263 --> 01:06:41,429
    That's it.
    Easy.

1137
01:06:41,431 --> 01:06:44,332
            Slipping it out.
            Here she comes.

1138
01:06:46,435 --> 01:06:48,203
  Thank you, Jane.

1139
01:06:48,205 --> 01:06:50,205
       You're welcome, Elaine.

1140
01:06:51,207 --> 01:06:54,509
                The drawing at
                the Money Ball
                is at 9:00.

1141
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:56,444
          10 minutes later,
          the place is closed.

1142
01:06:56,446 --> 01:06:58,546
           That means at 8:40,

1143
01:06:58,548 --> 01:07:02,283
               I have to here,
               in the backroom
               at Thom McAn.

1144
01:07:02,285 --> 01:07:05,787
          Elaine,
          you have to be here,

1145
01:07:05,789 --> 01:07:07,522
          backstage
          at the light switch.

1146
01:07:07,524 --> 01:07:11,693
  And, Jane, hopefully
  you'll be here in the canoe.

1147
01:07:12,294 --> 01:07:14,396
      Now,
      it all has to be done
      with split-second timing

1148
01:07:14,398 --> 01:07:17,132
  because at 9:10 on the nose,

1149
01:07:17,134 --> 01:07:19,167
      we gotta be out of there
      and on our way home.

1150
01:07:19,169 --> 01:07:21,469
                With the money.
                Or the police.

1151
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:24,873
      All right,
      now let's run it
      down again from the top,

1152
01:07:24,875 --> 01:07:26,875
    make sure we got it right.

1153
01:07:29,412 --> 01:07:34,482
            At 5:10, wearing
            my black corduroy
            Calvin Klein jeans

1154
01:07:34,484 --> 01:07:36,651
     and my favorite
     Yves Saint Laurent shirt,

1155
01:07:36,653 --> 01:07:37,886
                 I leave home,

1156
01:07:37,888 --> 01:07:40,388
             walking east
             on Bluebird Lane.

1157
01:07:41,157 --> 01:07:43,425
        Where at 5:33,
        I pick you up

1158
01:07:43,427 --> 01:07:45,660
    with the vacuum cleaner
    in the backseat of my car.

1159
01:07:45,662 --> 01:07:48,396
       We head for
       Valley River Center.

1160
01:07:48,664 --> 01:07:53,535
Uh, meanwhile, at 6:15,
I finish feeding the children.

1161
01:07:53,537 --> 01:07:57,272
I get into my car
and I head up Highway 9.

1162
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:00,708
I get off at Mazda Lane.
Next stop, the river.

1163
01:08:00,710 --> 01:08:03,211
     You forgot to mention
     the garbage bags
     and the canoe.

1164
01:08:03,213 --> 01:08:05,547
What do you think I am,
stupid?

1165
01:08:05,549 --> 01:08:08,616
Naturally, I have
the garbage bags
and the canoe.

1166
01:08:09,418 --> 01:08:10,919
At exactly 7:10,

1167
01:08:10,921 --> 01:08:12,720
I put the canoe
into the water

1168
01:08:12,722 --> 01:08:15,256
and I start paddling south.

1169
01:08:15,524 --> 01:08:16,524
                         Good.

1170
01:08:16,526 --> 01:08:23,298
       Meanwhile, Elaine and I
       have arrived at Valley
       River Center at 6:05,

1171
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:25,567
    and parked
    in the northeast
    corner of the parking lot.

1172
01:08:25,569 --> 01:08:26,935
This is going to be easy.

1173
01:08:26,937 --> 01:08:29,304
              That's what
              they told Nixon.

1174
01:08:29,306 --> 01:08:30,805
        Where I let you
        out of the car.

1175
01:08:30,807 --> 01:08:32,540
        You take care
        of the power saw,

1176
01:08:32,542 --> 01:08:35,276
          I'll take care
          of the vacuum cleaner.
          Check.

1177
01:08:35,278 --> 01:08:36,544
Check.
Check.

1178
01:08:36,546 --> 01:08:37,645
                     Tomorrow!

01:37:34,481 --> 01:37:38,351
I'm crazy about you.
I want to be with you
all the time.

1570
01:37:41,689 --> 01:37:44,757
          Then my phone number
          is 375-1096.

1571
01:37:45,860 --> 01:37:49,395
And seeing as how
you have a phone in your car,
it won't even cost you a dime.

1572
01:37:51,866 --> 01:37:53,299
        Okay.

1573
01:37:56,170 --> 01:37:57,570
            Bye, Jack.

1574
01:38:24,698 --> 01:38:27,800
                 $22,200,

1575
01:38:28,535 --> 01:38:31,237
                 $22,220,

1576
01:38:31,239 --> 01:38:33,573
                $22,240...

1577
01:38:33,575 --> 01:38:35,275
       (PHONE RINGING)

1578
01:38:36,543 --> 01:38:38,745
                  $22,260.

1579
01:38:41,715 --> 01:38:43,016
                  Hello?

1580
01:38:45,586 --> 01:38:46,853
                   Hi.

1581
01:38:50,557 --> 01:38:52,625
            Friday night
            would be terrific.

1582
01:38:54,795 --> 01:38:56,629
             8:00 is fine.

1583
01:38:59,266 --> 01:39:01,434
      Yes, I'll dress up, too.

1584
01:39:03,537 --> 01:39:05,638
      No, I love Chinese food.

1585
01:39:24,992 --> 01:39:27,560
ALBERT: Louise! Where are you?

1586
01:39:27,895 --> 01:39:30,330
I'm in the bedroom, Albert.

1587
01:39:31,565 --> 01:39:34,467
      Oh, God, it's nice
      to see you back in here.

1588
01:39:35,769 --> 01:39:39,439
Are you planning to
stay here for a little while?
It's a possibility.

1589
01:39:39,441 --> 01:39:42,909
         Look, Louise.
         I have a surprise
         for you in my pocket.

1590
01:39:42,911 --> 01:39:44,744
I've seen that surprise
before, Albert.

1591
01:39:44,746 --> 01:39:46,646
                 Not this one,
                 you haven't.

1592
01:39:46,981 --> 01:39:48,948
            What is it?
            It's from the IRS.

1593
01:39:48,950 --> 01:39:52,952
 I convinced them
 Ye Olde Antique Shoppe is
 not a hobby, it's a business.

1594
01:39:52,954 --> 01:39:55,688
           You open that store
           tomorrow morning.

1595
01:39:55,690 --> 01:39:59,659
Albert.
Oh, Albert, thank you!

1596
01:40:01,662 --> 01:40:04,364
        Wait, wait.
        We have to talk first.

1597
01:40:04,765 --> 01:40:08,368
Talk before sex?
Albert, how beautiful.

1598
01:40:08,370 --> 01:40:12,438
 One thing.
 Ye Olde Antique Shoppe has
 to show a profit every month.

1599
01:40:12,440 --> 01:40:16,442
It will. Albert,
I promise it will, it will.

1600
01:40:17,644 --> 01:40:19,479
          Take your clothes off.
          No.

1601
01:40:19,481 --> 01:40:21,381
           No?
           Ask me in French.

1602
01:40:22,383 --> 01:40:23,649
       (SPEAKING FRENCH)

1603
01:40:23,651 --> 01:40:26,419
          God, I love you!

1604

      (GASPING AND GRUNTING)

1605
01:40:31,358 --> 01:40:32,759
                Let me get rid
                of this tie.

1606
01:40:33,060 --> 01:40:34,694
                 Pull it off!

1607
01:40:40,501 --> 01:40:43,536
       ROBERT: It's true,
       all brides are beautiful.
       Thank you.

1608
01:40:49,343 --> 01:40:51,711
   Robert, why are you
   locking the door?

1609
01:40:51,713 --> 01:40:53,579
We're married, remember?

1610
01:40:53,581 --> 01:40:56,482
I know, but
your little monsters
are only 20 feet away.

1611
01:40:56,484 --> 01:40:58,084
          Our little monsters.

1612
01:40:59,720 --> 01:41:01,888
Still, it's a lot
better than my father.

1613
01:41:01,890 --> 01:41:05,691
         Yeah. God, I only
         hope he'll be happy
         in his new apartment.

1614
01:41:05,693 --> 01:41:07,827
Yeah. I only hope that
you'll be happy with him

1615
01:41:07,829 --> 01:41:09,896
working for you
at the hardware store.

1616
01:41:12,066 --> 01:41:15,802
     Jane, one small question.

1617
01:41:16,437 --> 01:41:19,705
Yes. The doctor says
that as long as you're
not too passionate,

1618
01:41:19,707 --> 01:41:22,442
   we can make love
   through the middle
   of the sixth month.

1619
01:41:22,444 --> 01:41:25,945
And as long as I'm not
too passionate, through
the middle of the seventh.

1620
01:41:30,717 --> 01:41:32,952
             But that wasn't
             the question.

1621
01:41:32,954 --> 01:41:36,756
           Oh.
           Baby, where did you
           get that money?

1622
01:41:37,758 --> 01:41:39,959
Oh, that. We stole it.

1623
01:41:40,561 --> 01:41:43,696
Louise and Elaine
and I stole it from
the Valley River Center.

1624
01:41:43,698 --> 01:41:45,898
You know,
Louise needed it
for the antique store,

1625
01:41:45,900 --> 01:41:49,569
             and Elaine needed
             it for Millard...
             Okay, okay, okay.

1626
01:41:49,571 --> 01:41:53,773
    But you know,
    someday you're going to
    have to tell me the truth.

1627
01:41:55,809 --> 01:41:58,444
Oh, that feels really good.

1628
01:41:58,446 --> 01:41:59,946
                I haven't done
                anything yet.

1629
01:41:59,948 --> 01:42:05,651
I know. It feels good not to
be in the back seat of a car
for the last two years.

1630
01:42:05,953 --> 01:42:09,088
      Where in the hell did
      you get the money, Jane?

1631
01:42:09,090 --> 01:42:11,991
I already told you,
we stole it.

1632
01:42:12,593 --> 01:42:14,760
Louise drilled a hole
underneath the platform.

1633
01:42:14,762 --> 01:42:16,829
Stuck a vacuum
up in that hole
and just...

1634
01:42:16,831 --> 01:42:18,898
          Sucked that money out.
          Okay, okay.

1635
01:42:18,900 --> 01:42:21,734
We took it out a conveyor belt
by the river where I came
up with a canoe.

1636
01:42:21,736 --> 01:42:23,970
Mmm-hmm.
But Louise stood up
in the canoe, so it sunk.

1637
01:42:23,972 --> 01:42:27,473
Everything was lost,
and Elaine came up,
really pissed off.

1638
01:42:27,475 --> 01:42:30,009
     Starts yelling at us,
     and Louise spots the money!
     Mmm-hmm.

1639
01:42:30,011 --> 01:42:32,178
So we put all
the money in...
