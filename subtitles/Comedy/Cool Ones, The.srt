1
00:00:06,436 --> 00:00:08,537
Okay, there you go.
That's it, now.

2
00:00:08,605 --> 00:00:10,705
Now, give me sultry.

3
00:00:11,973 --> 00:00:13,207
Not sulky, honey; sultry.

4
00:00:13,275 --> 00:00:14,542
Sultry...
Is it possible

5
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,177
they don't know
what sultry means?

6
00:00:16,244 --> 00:00:18,078
- They're models. They don't know
what anything means. - Okay.

7
00:00:18,146 --> 00:00:19,980
Sell the coat.

8
00:00:20,048 --> 00:00:21,182
Now let the coat sell you.

9
00:00:21,249 --> 00:00:23,551
No, no, no.
Fabio, is it?

10
00:00:23,619 --> 00:00:24,686
- Todd.
- Todd?

11
00:00:24,753 --> 00:00:26,085
Could you step out
for a second?

12
00:00:26,153 --> 00:00:27,688
Get in there and show him
how it's done, chief.

13
00:00:27,755 --> 00:00:28,689
Okay, sure.
Thank you, thank you.

14
00:00:28,756 --> 00:00:29,690
Here we go.
(chuckles)

15
00:00:29,757 --> 00:00:30,724
Yeah. I'm Zach.

16
00:00:30,792 --> 00:00:32,559
Uh, we went out a month ago.

17
00:00:32,627 --> 00:00:33,727
And it was so wonderful.

18
00:00:33,795 --> 00:00:34,861
SIMON:
Okay, you ready?

19
00:00:34,929 --> 00:00:36,730
You're out for a night
on the town.

20
00:00:36,798 --> 00:00:38,231
You're feeling
confident and sexy.

21
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:40,033
Okay, remember, you're not

22
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,167
just selling clothing;

23
00:00:41,235 --> 00:00:42,835
you're selling an attitude.
Now, go.

24
00:00:42,902 --> 00:00:45,270
That's it. You're feeling
good about yourselves.

25
00:00:45,339 --> 00:00:47,740
Oh, here comes a bus!
There it is! Good shock!

26
00:00:47,808 --> 00:00:48,874
Now give me tigers.

27
00:00:48,942 --> 00:00:50,976
Now baby tigers.

28
00:00:51,044 --> 00:00:53,325
- What's happening? - I just wanted
to see what they would do.

29
00:00:53,347 --> 00:00:54,279
Komiko, is it?

30
00:00:54,348 --> 00:00:56,048
- Carly.
- Carly, I want to see

31
00:00:56,115 --> 00:00:58,182
what happens if the dress is,
like, billowing in the wind.

32
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,017
So Zach's gonna twirl you out,

33
00:01:00,085 --> 00:01:01,953
and then pull you back in
and dip you. Okay.

34
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,254
Should I get back in there?

35
00:01:03,322 --> 00:01:04,989
Shh. No, no. Just wait.
Watch, learn.

36
00:01:05,057 --> 00:01:07,091
Okay, twirl her out.

37
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:09,694
Pull her back in...
and dip.

38
00:01:09,762 --> 00:01:10,962
Sweetie, just step out
real quick.

39
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,831
Let me show you, all right?

40
00:01:12,898 --> 00:01:13,997
- Okay.
- Okay.

41
00:01:14,065 --> 00:01:16,834
The trick is, look
him in the eyes,

42
00:01:16,901 --> 00:01:19,837
seducing, at the
same time, teasing.

43
00:01:19,904 --> 00:01:21,271
Remember, you're the prey,

44
00:01:21,339 --> 00:01:23,106
and you're inviting
the hunt, like...

45
00:01:23,174 --> 00:01:24,307
No, no, no.

46
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:27,878
And now you twirl
me, you brute!

47
00:01:27,945 --> 00:01:29,279
Yes! And then
spin me around.

48
00:01:29,347 --> 00:01:31,748
And then we go out,
and then back again!

49
00:01:31,815 --> 00:01:34,149
And then over the
other side. Yes.

50
00:01:34,217 --> 00:01:38,153
I'm a feather... borne on the
wind, lost in the clouds!

51
00:01:38,221 --> 00:01:39,221
Komiko, eyes on me.

52
00:01:39,289 --> 00:01:40,790
One time, and now spin,

53
00:01:40,858 --> 00:01:42,825
spin, spin, spin!

54
00:01:42,893 --> 00:01:45,294
I want you to do it like that.

62
00:02:04,212 --> 00:02:05,746
- What floor?
- 22.

63
00:02:05,814 --> 00:02:07,281
Hey, there he is.

64
00:02:07,348 --> 00:02:09,149
Great work on that
Neiman shoot yesterday.

65
00:02:09,217 --> 00:02:10,651
Ah, it was a team effort.

66
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:11,619
Nice jacket.

67
00:02:11,686 --> 00:02:12,953
Is that from the shoot?

68
00:02:13,021 --> 00:02:15,022
Oh, yeah, yeah,
it's from the shoot.

69
00:02:15,089 --> 00:02:16,189
Simon gave it to me.

70
00:02:16,257 --> 00:02:18,057
Kind of a token
of a job well done.

71
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:20,293
We did it, buddy.
The team.

72
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,762
But why did you get the jacket?

73
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,164
Oh, hey, it's not a big deal,
you know.

74
00:02:25,232 --> 00:02:27,166
The point is he's the
boss and he noticed us.

75
00:02:27,234 --> 00:02:28,935
This jacket symbolizes
our success.

76
00:02:29,002 --> 00:02:31,671
If I get a jacket,
it's like we both get a jacket.

77
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:33,673
But only you got a jacket.

78
00:02:33,741 --> 00:02:34,840
Which fits you great.

79
00:02:34,908 --> 00:02:36,642
I'm Zach, by the way.

80
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:37,910
- Mikaela.
- Hi.

81
00:02:37,978 --> 00:02:39,011
MIKAELA:
Hi.

82
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:41,013
Team.

83
00:02:44,051 --> 00:02:45,117
This is so unfair.

84
00:02:45,185 --> 00:02:46,685
You know what it is?

85
00:02:46,753 --> 00:02:48,220
It's your typical copywriter/
art guy dynamic.

86
00:02:48,288 --> 00:02:50,755
You talk more in the meetings,
so you get all the credit.

87
00:02:50,823 --> 00:02:52,424
What is it now? ZACH:
He thinks that Simon

88
00:02:52,425 --> 00:02:53,724
likes me better than him.

89
00:02:53,792 --> 00:02:54,759
SIMON:
Zach attack!

90
00:02:54,827 --> 00:02:55,994
Whoo-ooh!
Whoo-ooh!

91
00:02:56,062 --> 00:02:57,028
Wah!
Wah!

92
00:02:57,096 --> 00:02:58,296
Huh! Huh! Ooh!
Huh! Huh! Ooh!

93
00:02:58,364 --> 00:03:00,098
(both mimic explosion, grunt)

94
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:01,066
Hi, Simon.

95
00:03:01,133 --> 00:03:02,900
- Hey, Andrew.
- Um, Dad?

96
00:03:02,969 --> 00:03:04,702
Hmm? A guy just delivered a box
of ducklings to your office.

97
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,803
They're here.
It's for my pro bono project.

98
00:03:06,871 --> 00:03:08,638
You mean we're
not getting paid.

99
00:03:08,706 --> 00:03:10,774
But I'm saying it in Latin
so it has a certain gravitas.

100
00:03:10,842 --> 00:03:12,943
- What's going on?
- Remember Arrowhead Pond?

101
00:03:13,011 --> 00:03:15,112
It was an environmental disaster
back in the '80s.

102
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,246
Terrible, awful, really.

103
00:03:16,314 --> 00:03:17,747
Well, that pond
has been restored,

104
00:03:17,815 --> 00:03:18,949
and I'm personally raising
these ducks

105
00:03:19,017 --> 00:03:20,257
to be its very first residents.

106
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:22,018
Well, why are you
raising the ducks?

107
00:03:22,086 --> 00:03:23,219
Because they can't take care
of themselves, sweetheart.

108
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:24,420
No, I mean: Why you?

109
00:03:24,488 --> 00:03:26,689
Some people see me
as I am and ask why.

110
00:03:26,756 --> 00:03:28,358
- Can I get a straight answer?
- No, but you can get a gay one...

111
00:03:28,425 --> 00:03:30,426
because ducks are fabulous!

112
00:03:30,494 --> 00:03:33,363
I say it like that because
Gay Brad is out today.

113
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,831
I suppose he's out
every day, really.

114
00:03:35,899 --> 00:03:38,100
So you're telling me you're
raising ducks in the office?

115
00:03:38,101 --> 00:03:40,102
Honey, the time for that
disapproving tone

116
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:42,770
is when I'm making
these poor decisions.

117
00:03:42,838 --> 00:03:44,006
(sighs)

118
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:47,142
It's okay, Tesla.

119
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:48,810
They don't nest in trees.

120
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:50,412
- Well, maybe he's an outlier.
- They live in ponds.

121
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,779
Well, we don't have a pond.

122
00:03:51,847 --> 00:03:52,947
He'll just have to make do.

123
00:03:53,016 --> 00:03:54,176
Oh, and it seems like he did.

124
00:03:54,216 --> 00:03:55,449
Did you look over
my coffee campaign?

125
00:03:55,517 --> 00:03:56,817
It was brilliant,
it was perfect.

126
00:03:56,885 --> 00:03:57,951
But if you were gonna tweak it?

127
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:58,919
I'd start again from scratch.

128
00:03:58,987 --> 00:04:00,354
Here we go.

129
00:04:00,422 --> 00:04:02,123
There's always room
to aim higher.

130
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,158
There was once was a man named
Michael, last name Angelo.

131
00:04:04,226 --> 00:04:06,160
- Michelangelo.
- Yes. And when he was sculpting his David,

132
00:04:06,228 --> 00:04:08,095
do you think he finished
the torso and went,

133
00:04:08,163 --> 00:04:09,163
"Hey, va bene, tutti finito"?

134
00:04:09,231 --> 00:04:10,363
Guessing not.

135
00:04:10,431 --> 00:04:12,032
No, he slapped a penis
on that Adonis,

136
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:13,900
and the rest was history.
You know what I'm saying?

137
00:04:13,967 --> 00:04:15,701
- I need a penis?
- That's my girl.

138
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:17,404
Sydney, there's magic in you.

139
00:04:17,471 --> 00:04:19,312
I've known that since
the moment you were born.

140
00:04:19,373 --> 00:04:21,074
I looked down and said,
"Oh, my God..."

141
00:04:21,142 --> 00:04:22,909
- "She's missing a penis."
- But I still named you Sydney.

142
00:04:22,976 --> 00:04:24,144
- The campaign works.
- Honey...

143
00:04:24,211 --> 00:04:25,745
- The focus groups like it.
- Pumpkin...

144
00:04:25,812 --> 00:04:27,413
- Stop calling me food.
- You're playing it safe.

145
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,448
And the best things in life come
from not playing it safe.

146
00:04:29,516 --> 00:04:31,150
- It's a good campaign.
- Listen, I'd love

147
00:04:31,217 --> 00:04:33,018
to argue with you,
but I think it's a lost cause.

148
00:04:33,086 --> 00:04:34,420
Besides, I've gotta go finish
my Crest campaign

149
00:04:34,487 --> 00:04:36,155
and chop up some worms
for my ducks.

150
00:04:36,222 --> 00:04:38,457
Ciao, ragazza.

151
00:04:38,525 --> 00:04:40,759
ZACH: And then our guy walks outside.
Mm-hmm.

152
00:04:40,826 --> 00:04:43,494
It's a bright sunny day,
the pretty girl passes by,

153
00:04:43,562 --> 00:04:46,764
and he flashes her that
winning Crest smile.

154
00:04:46,831 --> 00:04:48,832
Suddenly, the sun
glinting off his teeth

155
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,168
like a laser pointer

156
00:04:50,235 --> 00:04:52,036
blinds her and everyone
else in the vicinity

157
00:04:52,104 --> 00:04:55,239
as our hero mutters an
apology and crosses off!

158
00:04:55,307 --> 00:04:56,507
Andrew.

159
00:04:58,009 --> 00:05:01,744
"Crest, sunglasses
not included."

160
00:05:01,812 --> 00:05:02,812
Oh, I love it.

161
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,747
Oh, great work, Zach.

162
00:05:04,815 --> 00:05:07,284
You know, Simon, a lot of that
was actually Andrew's idea.

163
00:05:07,351 --> 00:05:09,052
Let's not do this.

164
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,188
I'm confused. Didn't I say
you guys did a great job?

165
00:05:11,255 --> 00:05:13,290
Well, technically, you just
said Zach did a great job.

166
00:05:13,357 --> 00:05:14,890
I did, didn't I?

167
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:16,292
Also, I think Andrew's
a little upset

168
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:18,227
because I got a jacket
and he didn't,

169
00:05:18,295 --> 00:05:19,828
even though I explained to him

170
00:05:19,896 --> 00:05:21,163
how me sleeping with the girl
who liked the jacket

171
00:05:21,231 --> 00:05:23,099
is gonna be a victory
for both of us.

172
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:25,067
I'm still not seeing that.
But seriously, Simon, it's fine.

173
00:05:25,135 --> 00:05:27,203
No, no, it's not fine. I mean,
I know what goes into a pitch.

174
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,071
I know you both worked on this.

175
00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:30,505
Maybe it's just 'cause
he talks more in the meetings.

176
00:05:30,573 --> 00:05:32,073
Yeah, that's what I was saying.

177
00:05:32,141 --> 00:05:33,341
Maybe I like you more
on a subconscious level.

178
00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:34,275
- Getting more hurtful.
- I should know better.

179
00:05:34,343 --> 00:05:35,943
A boss can't be doing this.

180
00:05:36,011 --> 00:05:37,345
He can't play favorites.

181
00:05:37,413 --> 00:05:39,080
I'm gonna make an effort
to be a little more fair.

182
00:05:39,148 --> 00:05:40,881
You know,
spread the love around.

183
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:42,417
Zach, give Andrew the jacket.

184
00:05:42,485 --> 00:05:43,818
Huh?

185
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:44,986
Words without actions
are meaningless.

186
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,293
- Okay.
- I think Stalin said that.

187
00:05:46,354 --> 00:05:47,988
Well, if he didn't,
he should have.

188
00:05:48,055 --> 00:05:49,490
There you go. Let go.
Andrew, come on, come on.

189
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,291
There you go.
Try that puppy on there.

190
00:05:51,359 --> 00:05:53,399
Wow, it's my-my very first
leather jacket, actually.

191
00:05:53,461 --> 00:05:55,295
- And how does that feel?
- It feels, uh...

192
00:05:55,363 --> 00:05:57,364
it feels pretty great.

193
00:05:57,432 --> 00:05:58,965
You know what?
It looks better on Zach.

194
00:05:59,033 --> 00:06:00,234
- It's me. It's me.
- Give it back, yeah.

195
00:06:00,301 --> 00:06:01,468
I just can't unsee Zach

196
00:06:01,536 --> 00:06:03,136
- in that jacket. Come on.
- Good try, bud.

197
00:06:03,203 --> 00:06:05,070
It's okay. We'll find something
that will...

198
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:06,071
We're gonna crack this thing.

199
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,540
We'll figure it out, bud.

200
00:06:07,608 --> 00:06:09,568
And with this targeted
bus-and-billboard campaign,

201
00:06:09,576 --> 00:06:11,810
we project increased growth
in public awareness

202
00:06:11,878 --> 00:06:13,212
for Windy City
over the next five years.

203
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,480
What do you think?

204
00:06:14,548 --> 00:06:16,215
Well, it's certainly
along the lines

205
00:06:16,283 --> 00:06:18,350
of what we hope to do,
you know, sales-wise.

206
00:06:18,417 --> 00:06:20,852
I guess we were hoping for
something a little more...

207
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:22,487
- (whispers): Penis...
- exciting.

208
00:06:22,555 --> 00:06:24,822
We want to edge up
our brand a little bit.

209
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,292
Well, what's exciting
is reliable sales growth.

210
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,427
You know, what's edgy is, uh,

211
00:06:29,495 --> 00:06:31,363
increased market share.

212
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,097
Lauren, what do you...
what do you think?

213
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:35,166
Oh, I'm just the assistant,
but I would definitely

214
00:06:35,233 --> 00:06:37,034
sleep with a
Windy City Coffee drinker

215
00:06:37,101 --> 00:06:39,403
based on the strength of this
bus-and-billboard campaign.

216
00:06:39,471 --> 00:06:41,472
Well, I mean, it does
have its merits.

217
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,540
Yeah.

218
00:06:42,607 --> 00:06:44,041
What about a spectacular?

219
00:06:44,108 --> 00:06:45,209
They don't want a spectacular.

220
00:06:45,277 --> 00:06:46,410
Oh, you're right.

221
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:48,011
It's too big, it's too exciting.

222
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:48,945
Not your thing.

223
00:06:49,013 --> 00:06:50,013
Hey, we want big.

224
00:06:50,081 --> 00:06:51,162
Yeah. What's a spectacular?

225
00:06:51,215 --> 00:06:52,615
Sydney?

226
00:06:54,218 --> 00:06:56,586
It's a media event designed
to get attention.

227
00:06:56,654 --> 00:06:59,289
Like when Red Bull parachuted
that guy from outer space.

228
00:06:59,356 --> 00:07:00,323
- Yes!
- Let's do that!

229
00:07:00,391 --> 00:07:01,957
- Exactly that.
- Yeah!

230
00:07:02,025 --> 00:07:04,294
They already did that.
That's how we know about it.

231
00:07:04,361 --> 00:07:05,495
Lauren, what do you think?

232
00:07:05,563 --> 00:07:07,162
I'd give it up
to spectacular guy

233
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,497
way quicker than billboard guy.

234
00:07:08,565 --> 00:07:10,432
That's enough, Lauren.

235
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,133
And Sydney's spectacular will be
even better than Red Bull's.

236
00:07:12,202 --> 00:07:13,962
It'll be stunning,
stupendous, extraordinary.

237
00:07:14,003 --> 00:07:15,404
- You're literally just saying adjectives.
- We're in.

238
00:07:15,471 --> 00:07:16,905
We haven't even pitched
you a specific.

239
00:07:16,972 --> 00:07:18,473
- It could be anything!
- We love that.

240
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:20,175
Anything, anybody,
she can do it.

241
00:07:20,243 --> 00:07:21,910
- We love her!
- Welcome to my world!

242
00:07:21,977 --> 00:07:22,943
- Yeah!
- Let's do it!

243
00:07:23,011 --> 00:07:23,911
She's gonna figure it out!

244
00:07:23,978 --> 00:07:24,912
- Yeah!
- Spectacular!

245
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:26,880
Game on! Yeah!

246
00:07:26,948 --> 00:07:28,015
Abbondanza.

247
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,450
What was that?!

248
00:07:29,518 --> 00:07:31,919
Now I have to come up
with the biggest idea ever?

249
00:07:31,986 --> 00:07:34,106
Not ever, just in the history
of American advertising.

250
00:07:34,155 --> 00:07:35,155
I don't do big.

251
00:07:35,224 --> 00:07:36,591
I do steady.
I do dependable.

252
00:07:36,658 --> 00:07:38,291
I'm not you.

253
00:07:38,359 --> 00:07:40,059
Honey, the apple doesn't fall
far from the tree.

254
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:41,961
Sorry. I'm not supposed
to call you food.

255
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:43,930
I'm just happy you moved on
from the penis metaphor.

256
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:46,199
Yeah, I think I beat
that one to death.

257
00:07:46,267 --> 00:07:47,934
Sorry. Did that rub you
the wrong way?

258
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:48,935
Blah...!

259
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:50,403
It's not that hard, really.

260
00:07:50,471 --> 00:07:53,139
It's a stiff challenge,
but I know you're up to it.

261
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,342
You guys bring out
the worst in me.

262
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:57,509
It's amazing.

263
00:08:06,441 --> 00:08:08,393
Feel terrible about
this Andrew thing.

264
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:10,322
I want to do something
special for him.

265
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,124
You know, something that says,

266
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:14,393
"I see you every day,
but now I actually see you."

267
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:16,095
You slap that sentiment
on a mug,

268
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,562
I think you got
one happy Andrew.

269
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,365
Maybe I could take
him to a Bulls game.

270
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:21,266
You know, the Heat are
in town this week.

271
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,501
- Yeah, you could do that.
- What?

272
00:08:23,568 --> 00:08:26,104
I just thought the Bulls games
were kind of our thing.

273
00:08:26,171 --> 00:08:27,505
True. I hated it
when I said it.

274
00:08:27,572 --> 00:08:29,273
God, this is hard.

275
00:08:29,341 --> 00:08:31,976
Why did you have to look so
much better in that jacket?

276
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:33,244
(sighs) Sorry, boss.

277
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:35,046
- It's these damn swimmer's shoulders.
- Yeah.

278
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:36,714
Hey, maybe I can let Andrew

279
00:08:36,781 --> 00:08:38,515
take point with me on
this duck-raising thing.

280
00:08:38,582 --> 00:08:40,984
I was looking for backup.
I was hoping you would do it,

281
00:08:41,052 --> 00:08:42,252
- but, you know...
- What exactly would that entail?

282
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,586
There's cage cleaning,

283
00:08:43,654 --> 00:08:45,455
bottle feeding
and this thing called "venting"

284
00:08:45,456 --> 00:08:48,025
where you use a tiny brush
to clean the duck's anus.

285
00:08:48,092 --> 00:08:50,560
They need help.
They don't have sphincters.

286
00:08:50,628 --> 00:08:52,562
And their mom's not around
to lick them, so...

287
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,030
You know what?

288
00:08:54,097 --> 00:08:55,031
What?

289
00:08:55,065 --> 00:08:56,365
Let Andrew take this one.

290
00:08:56,433 --> 00:08:59,068
You're a good friend.

291
00:09:05,342 --> 00:09:07,243
Well, I spent half the night
with the team

292
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:08,511
banging our heads
against the wall.

293
00:09:08,578 --> 00:09:10,098
And then I finally sent
everybody home,

294
00:09:10,112 --> 00:09:12,013
and then I banged my head
some more, and then

295
00:09:12,081 --> 00:09:13,381
- I finally cracked it.
- The spectacular?

296
00:09:13,449 --> 00:09:15,517
- Yes. And it's amazing.
- Why is she upset?

297
00:09:15,584 --> 00:09:17,145
'Cause I was right.
You could do better.

298
00:09:17,186 --> 00:09:18,386
Fine, all right, there's
genius within me.

299
00:09:18,454 --> 00:09:19,720
I get it. There's no
limit to the heights

300
00:09:19,788 --> 00:09:21,389
I can achieve in this
industry. You win.

301
00:09:21,457 --> 00:09:23,658
I'm sorry I had to be
the one to break it to you.

302
00:09:23,725 --> 00:09:24,692
Well, what is it?

303
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,226
It's simple, but it's big.

304
00:09:27,162 --> 00:09:28,562
(sighs) Wow.

305
00:09:29,497 --> 00:09:30,697
Oh...

306
00:09:30,765 --> 00:09:32,326
All you need
is a giant bottle of scotch

307
00:09:32,367 --> 00:09:34,168
and you have my breakfast
during college.

308
00:09:34,235 --> 00:09:35,735
Okay, it's an optical illusion.
See, there's a pipe that runs

309
00:09:35,803 --> 00:09:37,371
from the cup all the way up
to the carafe that's hidden

310
00:09:37,439 --> 00:09:38,638
by the falling coffee.
Mm-hmm.

311
00:09:38,706 --> 00:09:40,307
And wait for it.
This is the best part.

312
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:41,508
It's three stories tall.

313
00:09:41,576 --> 00:09:42,708
(gasps)
Wow, Syd, that's fantastic.

314
00:09:42,776 --> 00:09:43,742
Nice rendering.

315
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:45,111
Andrew did it.

316
00:09:45,179 --> 00:09:47,180
Andrew, eh?
That's a job well done.

317
00:09:47,247 --> 00:09:48,581
It's about to be noticed

318
00:09:48,648 --> 00:09:50,616
and rewarded.

319
00:09:50,684 --> 00:09:52,251
That's it.
The important thing

320
00:09:52,319 --> 00:09:54,253
to remember when
cleaning a duck's anus

321
00:09:54,321 --> 00:09:55,654
is to go against the feathers.

322
00:09:55,722 --> 00:09:57,390
That's it...
against the feathers.

323
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:59,558
- Oh, okay.
- Okay. Other way. That's it. That's it.

324
00:09:59,626 --> 00:10:01,093
- You having fun, buddy?
- Oh, yeah.

325
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,360
- This is terrific.
- ZACH: Hey, you guys want

326
00:10:02,428 --> 00:10:04,096
- to grab some lunch?
- Uh, I don't know

327
00:10:04,163 --> 00:10:05,263
how hungry I am.

328
00:10:05,331 --> 00:10:06,364
Hey, you missed a
spot right there.

329
00:10:06,432 --> 00:10:07,592
Look, uh, Simon, I don't mean

330
00:10:07,601 --> 00:10:09,267
to seem ungrateful
or anything, but...

331
00:10:09,335 --> 00:10:11,136
What?
What is it?

332
00:10:11,204 --> 00:10:14,306
Uh, I so appreciate you trying
to do something nice for me.

333
00:10:14,373 --> 00:10:17,241
The thing is, this specific thing...
Uh-huh?

334
00:10:17,309 --> 00:10:18,676
I-I don't totally get it.

335
00:10:18,744 --> 00:10:19,777
- Listen.
- Yeah?

336
00:10:19,845 --> 00:10:21,545
I know that on the face of it

337
00:10:21,614 --> 00:10:23,114
it doesn't seem that glamorous,

338
00:10:23,181 --> 00:10:25,516
but this whole pond cleanup thing...
Mm-hmm.

339
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:27,118
Isn't just a tax write-off.

340
00:10:27,185 --> 00:10:29,386
It's the pond where my dad
used to take me fishing.

341
00:10:29,454 --> 00:10:31,822
And I hope one day to take
my grandkid fishing there...

342
00:10:31,889 --> 00:10:33,490
if Sydney could ever sustain
a relationship.

343
00:10:33,557 --> 00:10:35,558
So this is really
important to you.

344
00:10:35,627 --> 00:10:38,629
It's the most important
assignment I could give anyone.

345
00:10:38,696 --> 00:10:40,764
- Huh.
- Huh.

346
00:10:40,832 --> 00:10:42,733
I don't think I'll be going
to lunch today, either.

347
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,636
Andrew and I have some
important matters to attend to.

348
00:10:49,572 --> 00:10:51,841
You may want to use your pinky,
'cause you can't get

349
00:10:51,908 --> 00:10:53,509
all the gunk out
with just a toothbrush.

350
00:10:53,576 --> 00:10:54,844
♪ Imagine me and you

351
00:10:54,911 --> 00:10:56,512
♪ And you and me

352
00:10:56,579 --> 00:10:58,848
♪ No matter how
they tossed the dice ♪

353
00:10:58,915 --> 00:11:00,582
♪ it had to be

354
00:11:00,651 --> 00:11:02,751
♪ The only one for me is you

355
00:11:02,852 --> 00:11:04,653
♪ And you for me

356
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,791
♪ So happy together

357
00:11:09,859 --> 00:11:11,793
♪ I can't see me

358
00:11:11,861 --> 00:11:15,263

00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:17,699

00:11:20,635 --> 00:11:22,670

362
00:11:22,737 --> 00:11:26,540

00:11:26,607 --> 00:11:28,275

00:11:28,342 --> 00:11:30,844
♪ Baby, the skies will be blue

00:11:30,912 --> 00:11:33,180
♪ For all my life...

366
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:35,414
With a push
of this ceremonial button,

367
00:11:35,482 --> 00:11:37,416
Daley Plaza will transform

368
00:11:37,484 --> 00:11:38,751
into Windy City Coffee Plaza!

369
00:11:38,819 --> 00:11:40,380
No deal was actually made
with the city.

370
00:11:40,387 --> 00:11:41,587
Daley Plaza remains
the official name.

371
00:11:41,655 --> 00:11:43,222
Sydney...

372
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:44,724
Enjoy free coffee, Chicago!

373
00:11:44,792 --> 00:11:46,525
(remote beeps)

374
00:11:46,593 --> 00:11:47,660
(crowd cheering) Yeah!

375
00:11:53,299 --> 00:11:54,199
Here you go.

376
00:11:54,266 --> 00:11:55,366
- Scone?
- Thank you.

377
00:11:56,535 --> 00:11:58,737
It's truly spectacular.

378
00:11:58,805 --> 00:12:00,205
You did it, Sydney.

379
00:12:00,272 --> 00:12:01,206
Thanks, Lauren.

380
00:12:01,273 --> 00:12:02,340
Nobody thought you could.

381
00:12:02,408 --> 00:12:03,568
- What?
- I push you hard, honey,

382
00:12:03,609 --> 00:12:04,810
because I know
how great you can be.

383
00:12:04,877 --> 00:12:05,877
And now everybody
knows it, too.

384
00:12:05,945 --> 00:12:08,145
I'm so proud of you, sweetie.

385
00:12:08,213 --> 00:12:10,414
That's my daughter's
penis up there.

386
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,510
(duck peeping) Did you
bring a duck with you?

387
00:12:13,518 --> 00:12:14,852
What? No.

388
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,253
(duck peeping)

389
00:12:16,321 --> 00:12:18,723
Scotty gets separation anxiety.

390
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:19,724
Shh.

391
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:21,625
Papa's here.

392
00:12:21,693 --> 00:12:22,792
Papa's here.

393
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,527
It's a little windy today, huh?

394
00:12:25,562 --> 00:12:26,596
Is it starting to rain?

395
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:27,797
It's not supposed to.

396
00:12:27,865 --> 00:12:29,532
Honey, how are you
containing the liquid?

397
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,400
Some sort of
wind-guard, or...?

398
00:12:31,468 --> 00:12:32,401
Wh...

399
00:12:32,469 --> 00:12:33,737
Uh-oh.

400
00:12:33,804 --> 00:12:35,404
What?

401
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:37,907
You feel that?

402
00:12:37,975 --> 00:12:39,908
Hey.
It's raining coffee!

403
00:12:39,976 --> 00:12:41,896
Everybody, get out of the way!
(people screaming)

404
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,881
(crowd screaming)

405
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,554
SYDNEY:
Don't forget to

406
00:12:52,622 --> 00:12:54,922
grab a free scone
while you're fleeing!

407
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:55,990
Is that hazelnut?

408
00:12:56,058 --> 00:12:57,558
Because it's delicious, really.

409
00:13:04,435 --> 00:13:06,637
They are calling it
the dry cleaning bills

410
00:13:06,662 --> 00:13:08,796
to end all dry cleaning bills.

411
00:13:08,864 --> 00:13:11,233
Local chain Windy City Coffee

412
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,235
attempted what
a spokesperson referred to

413
00:13:13,302 --> 00:13:14,602
as a "spectacular."

414
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:16,203
But when things went awry,

415
00:13:16,271 --> 00:13:18,405
what went down
will be remembered

416
00:13:18,473 --> 00:13:21,808
for a long time
as a spectacular failure.

417
00:13:21,876 --> 00:13:24,278
Oh, that's clever how they
used the word against you.

418
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:26,514
I destroyed
an entire city block.

419
00:13:26,581 --> 00:13:28,115
I'm like a supervillain.

420
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:30,583
Oh, come on, nobody could have
anticipated this.

421
00:13:30,651 --> 00:13:32,152
That was an unusual
amount of wind.

422
00:13:32,219 --> 00:13:33,253
Thank you.

423
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,587
Although it is literally called

424
00:13:34,655 --> 00:13:35,588
Windy City Coffee.

425
00:13:35,656 --> 00:13:36,656
And this is

426
00:13:36,723 --> 00:13:38,158
the Windy City.

427
00:13:38,225 --> 00:13:40,160
Ooh, someone's getting
a little peckish.

428
00:13:40,227 --> 00:13:41,467
I should get back.
Feeding time.

429
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,129
Hey, you know what?
I can feed them.

430
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,464
What? ZACH: Yeah, yeah.

431
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:45,798
I mean, I should help
with the ducks, too.

432
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:46,798
Team.

433
00:13:46,866 --> 00:13:47,799
Yeah, yeah, but the ducks,

434
00:13:47,867 --> 00:13:49,268
that's kind of my gig.

435
00:13:49,335 --> 00:13:50,802
It's true.
He's proven himself

436
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,337
to be the man for the job.

437
00:13:52,405 --> 00:13:53,738
Also, the ducks
have imprinted on him.

438
00:13:53,806 --> 00:13:55,374
They now believe
he's their mother.

439
00:13:55,441 --> 00:13:57,509
Hey, may I speak with
you for a moment?

440
00:13:57,577 --> 00:13:58,577
- Yeah.
- Come on.

441
00:13:58,645 --> 00:13:59,844
So, uh...

442
00:13:59,912 --> 00:14:00,912
what was that back there?

443
00:14:00,913 --> 00:14:02,113
What?

444
00:14:02,181 --> 00:14:03,147
The ducks are
my thing with Simon,

445
00:14:03,215 --> 00:14:05,249
and now... you're jealous.

446
00:14:05,317 --> 00:14:07,318
(laughing):
I am not jealous.

447
00:14:07,386 --> 00:14:08,786
- Oh?
- I don't get jealous.

448
00:14:08,853 --> 00:14:10,688
Oh, no, I-I truly believe that.

449
00:14:10,755 --> 00:14:12,790
I-I do. I believe
that that is an emotion

450
00:14:12,857 --> 00:14:15,259
you are not fully capable
of understanding.

451
00:14:15,327 --> 00:14:16,487
That's how good your life is.

452
00:14:16,528 --> 00:14:18,662
But see, today...
I'm the one

453
00:14:18,729 --> 00:14:21,164
that's buddying around
with Simon, so...

454
00:14:21,232 --> 00:14:23,132
How... how does that
make you feel?

455
00:14:23,901 --> 00:14:25,402
I don't really like it.

456
00:14:25,469 --> 00:14:27,804
You-you kind of wish
the roles were reversed?

457
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:30,307
A little bit, yeah.

458
00:14:30,374 --> 00:14:31,608
You got, like,
an emptiness in your stomach,

459
00:14:31,676 --> 00:14:33,310
a pit that you can't quite name?

460
00:14:33,377 --> 00:14:34,710
Maybe.

461
00:14:34,777 --> 00:14:37,913
That, my friend, is jealousy.

462
00:14:41,318 --> 00:14:42,384
(duck peeping)

463
00:14:43,653 --> 00:14:45,221
Can I hold the duck
for a little bit?

464
00:14:45,288 --> 00:14:47,223
I'm sorry, no.

465
00:14:53,395 --> 00:14:54,329
Sweetie, you tried.

466
00:14:54,396 --> 00:14:55,530
That's the important thing.

467
00:14:55,598 --> 00:14:57,265
Yep, I tried and I failed.

468
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:58,733
I told you I'm not you.

469
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,868
Your problem is, you don't
see me for my imperfections.

470
00:15:00,936 --> 00:15:02,303
Please, not the Yoda
birthmark again.

471
00:15:02,371 --> 00:15:03,771
But it looks just like him.

472
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,680
I'm saying that my big
ideas don't always work.

473
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:08,375
I've had some spectacular
failures of my own.

474
00:15:08,443 --> 00:15:10,444
You know that pond
I've been helping

475
00:15:10,511 --> 00:15:12,479
to recover from
the environmental disaster?

476
00:15:12,547 --> 00:15:15,716
Well, that disaster
was all my fault.

477
00:15:15,783 --> 00:15:17,317
What are you talking about?

478
00:15:17,385 --> 00:15:19,219
It was back in the '80s.

479
00:15:19,287 --> 00:15:21,521
A large crowd had gathered
for what was being called

480
00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:23,723
the spectacular
to end all spectaculars.

481
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,258
And the sponsor

482
00:15:25,325 --> 00:15:27,226
was America's favorite
saliva-powered candy:

483
00:15:27,294 --> 00:15:28,461
Pop Rocks.

484
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:30,596
I poured tons and
tons of that stuff

485
00:15:30,664 --> 00:15:32,231
into that pond.

486
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:33,899
I was hoping for maybe
a little fizzing, you know,

487
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:35,200
a little crackling.

488
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:36,535
No.

489
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:37,670
It was a pink eruption.

490
00:15:37,738 --> 00:15:39,771
It was like a Pop Rock Pompeii.

491
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:42,974
It was my PopRockalypse Now.

492
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,442
I remember seeing

493
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,645
little kids covered in pink,
crying.

494
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:49,648
(sighs)

495
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:50,782
And the noise, just...

496
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:52,517
(makes burbling,
crackling noise)

497
00:15:52,585 --> 00:15:55,519
It was like
the devil's flatulence.

498
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:57,521
Sales blew up.

499
00:15:57,589 --> 00:15:59,856
But so did a lot of the fish.

500
00:15:59,924 --> 00:16:02,726
My point is, baby,
I know failure.

501
00:16:02,794 --> 00:16:04,595
Thanks, Dad.

502
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:05,663
You're welcome, kitten.

503
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:07,230
(iPad chimes) LAUREN: Uh-oh.

504
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,199
Another e-mail from
the Windy City people.

505
00:16:09,267 --> 00:16:10,233
They are not happy.

506
00:16:10,301 --> 00:16:11,501
It's okay.

507
00:16:11,568 --> 00:16:12,902
We're gonna figure this out.

508
00:16:12,969 --> 00:16:13,903
Yes, we are!

509
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:14,937
I believe in you!

510
00:16:15,005 --> 00:16:16,939
Check it out!
We're on TV.

511
00:16:17,007 --> 00:16:18,775
Christie Moon,
channel four news.

512
00:16:18,842 --> 00:16:20,777
We were hoping to get a few
words from the perpetrator,

513
00:16:20,844 --> 00:16:22,378
- if you have a moment.
- Uh, sorry...

514
00:16:22,446 --> 00:16:23,646
Yo, everybody, I'm famous!

515
00:16:23,714 --> 00:16:24,681
What, what!

516
00:16:24,748 --> 00:16:25,915
MOON:
Oh, this just in:

517
00:16:25,982 --> 00:16:27,248
new footage of people fleeing.

518
00:16:27,317 --> 00:16:29,384
It's raining coffee!

519
00:16:29,452 --> 00:16:30,985
Everybody out of the way!

520
00:16:31,053 --> 00:16:32,987
(people screaming)

521
00:16:35,591 --> 00:16:38,827
It was like something
out of a horror movie.

522
00:16:42,597 --> 00:16:43,832
(cheery music plays)

523
00:16:43,999 --> 00:16:47,202
SIMON (over video): It was a
beautiful day in sunny Chicago.

524
00:16:47,769 --> 00:16:49,570
Until...

525
00:16:52,774 --> 00:16:53,907
It's raining coffee!

526
00:16:53,975 --> 00:16:56,310
SIMON:
The attack of the killer coffee!

527
00:16:56,378 --> 00:16:58,011
(screaming)

528
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,446
That's actually quite tasty.
Whoa!

529
00:16:59,513 --> 00:17:01,648
Run for your lives!

530
00:17:01,716 --> 00:17:03,983
(screaming)

531
00:17:04,051 --> 00:17:05,918
SIMON:
Windy City Coffee.

532
00:17:05,986 --> 00:17:07,821
Dangerously good.

533
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:13,259
That's what I'm talking about.

534
00:17:13,327 --> 00:17:14,593
Edgy, edgy.

535
00:17:14,661 --> 00:17:15,927
We also have
a red-band version

536
00:17:15,995 --> 00:17:17,496
we'd like to leak
online with your permission.

537
00:17:17,564 --> 00:17:19,004
There's a particular girl
whose shirt

538
00:17:19,031 --> 00:17:20,711
- gets just the right
amount of soaked.
- Um...

539
00:17:20,767 --> 00:17:21,700
is it possible...

540
00:17:21,768 --> 00:17:22,768
We'll e-mail
you the link.

541
00:17:22,769 --> 00:17:24,837
Awesome.

542
00:17:28,908 --> 00:17:31,442
(ducks peeping)

543
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,510
Everyone's here.

544
00:17:32,578 --> 00:17:33,778
We can start whenever you want.

545
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:35,446
There's a lot of diabetic frogs

546
00:17:35,514 --> 00:17:37,314
who've been waiting
20 years for this.

547
00:17:37,383 --> 00:17:38,983
Hey, Simon, are we sure
that it's a good idea

548
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:40,411
to release these ducks
into nature?

549
00:17:40,419 --> 00:17:41,452
I mean, what if
they're city ducks?

550
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,320
Sorry, Andrew, but it's time.

551
00:17:43,389 --> 00:17:44,722
I'm gonna miss you, little guy.

552
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:47,491
I'm gonna miss you, too.

553
00:17:47,558 --> 00:17:49,860
Said the duck.
Ah.

554
00:17:50,928 --> 00:17:52,362
SIMON:
Ladies and gentlemen,

555
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,697
you're all here today

556
00:17:53,765 --> 00:17:55,399
because you've been
part of the effort

557
00:17:55,466 --> 00:17:58,034
to bring life back to this
beautiful body of water.

558
00:17:58,102 --> 00:18:00,771
Others were quick to walk away,

559
00:18:00,838 --> 00:18:03,038
declaring it just another
candy-related catastrophe

560
00:18:03,106 --> 00:18:05,841
like the gobstopping
of the Chicago River in '82,

561
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:07,976
or the Nerd melt of '81.

562
00:18:09,913 --> 00:18:11,714
But today is proof
of what happens

563
00:18:11,782 --> 00:18:14,517
if you dare to dream big
and work small.

564
00:18:14,584 --> 00:18:17,920
There were days I didn't know
if we'd succeed.

565
00:18:17,987 --> 00:18:20,388
But if I've learned
one thing in this life,

566
00:18:20,456 --> 00:18:21,989
there's no shame in failing.

567
00:18:22,057 --> 00:18:23,858
The only shame

568
00:18:23,926 --> 00:18:26,027
is in not giving things
your best shot.

569
00:18:28,564 --> 00:18:30,097
Thank you for that smattering.

570
00:18:30,165 --> 00:18:33,501
And now,
to quote Jacques Cousteau...

571
00:18:33,569 --> 00:18:35,035
(French accent):
...it is time to restore things

572
00:18:35,102 --> 00:18:36,703
back to their natural order.

573
00:18:36,771 --> 00:18:39,039
To get back
to the way things were.

574
00:18:39,106 --> 00:18:42,108
Andrew, release the quackens!

575
00:18:42,176 --> 00:18:43,710
ANDREW:
I'm gonna miss you guys.

576
00:18:43,778 --> 00:18:45,579
But I'm gonna come
and visit you every Sunday.

577
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,421
Scott, I'm gonna bring you
your favorite bread.

578
00:18:47,449 --> 00:18:49,049
Sharon, you're gonna
meet someone.

579
00:18:49,116 --> 00:18:50,650
You're so beautiful.

580
00:18:50,717 --> 00:18:52,051
- David...
- Andrew, it's time to go.

581
00:18:52,118 --> 00:18:53,519
(whispering):
I'll talk to you Sunday, David.

582
00:18:53,587 --> 00:18:55,387
(ducks peeping)

583
00:18:55,456 --> 00:18:56,422
Go.

584
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:57,457
Swim away.

585
00:18:57,524 --> 00:18:58,558
Be free.

586
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,693
I release you.

587
00:19:00,761 --> 00:19:02,495
On your way, now.

588
00:19:03,564 --> 00:19:05,765
What are you guys doing?

589
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:06,898
Come on, get out of here.

590
00:19:06,966 --> 00:19:08,700
Scram.

591
00:19:08,768 --> 00:19:11,636
Do you realize how hard
you're making this for me?

592
00:19:12,772 --> 00:19:14,105
Yeah, they're not moving.

593
00:19:14,173 --> 00:19:16,441
Guess we'll have
to keep them after all.

594
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:19,644
There is another possibility.

595
00:19:21,781 --> 00:19:23,380
ANDREW:
Come on!

596
00:19:23,448 --> 00:19:24,515
Come on, duckies.

597
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,049
Over here.

598
00:19:26,117 --> 00:19:27,585
Good, Taylor.

599
00:19:28,887 --> 00:19:29,987
That's it!

600
00:19:30,054 --> 00:19:31,054
Yeah, keep going!

601
00:19:31,122 --> 00:19:32,756
(ducks peeping)

602
00:19:32,824 --> 00:19:34,424
Poor guy.
It's a little chilly out.

603
00:19:34,493 --> 00:19:35,559
Are you cold, buddy?

604
00:19:35,627 --> 00:19:36,988
Oh, no, I'm good.
I got the jacket.

605
00:19:37,028 --> 00:19:38,495
Yeah, you do.

606
00:19:38,562 --> 00:19:40,563
How long do you think
he has to stay in there?

607
00:19:40,631 --> 00:19:42,565
Just a couple of hours,
till they get acclimated.

608
00:19:42,633 --> 00:19:43,700
There you go!

609
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:45,101
Little further.
Good work, Andrew!

610
00:19:45,168 --> 00:19:46,102
You proud of me?

611
00:19:46,169 --> 00:19:47,871
Yeah, buddy, you did great!

612
00:19:47,938 --> 00:19:48,838
They love you!

613
00:19:48,906 --> 00:19:50,573
Thanks, Da... Simon.

614
00:19:50,641 --> 00:19:52,909
Go.

615
00:19:58,436 --> 00:19:59,737
Swim away!

616
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:01,299
You are free now!

617
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:02,901
MAN: Oh, that's
not right. Sorry.

618
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:05,436
(laughter) There they go.

619
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:07,071
Four out of five dentists agree

620
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:08,539
it was the worst environmental
disaster of the '80s.

621
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:10,341
It was like a
Candyland Chernobyl.

622
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:11,909
They found Nemo.
He was all over.

623
00:20:11,943 --> 00:20:14,044
The bubbling, the bubbling,
the bubbling, the bubbling...

624
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:16,479
It was like a fart from hell.

625
00:20:16,547 --> 00:20:17,814
(high-pitched voice):
You can do it, Dorothy.

626
00:20:17,882 --> 00:20:19,383
A girl with a good
pair of shoes

627
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:20,617
can go a long way.

628
00:20:20,684 --> 00:20:21,964
Woof, woof! (laughing): Stop it.

629
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,820
We put every metaphor we could

630
00:20:23,888 --> 00:20:25,022
in everything we tried.

631
00:20:25,089 --> 00:20:26,423
(gargles)

632
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:28,490
How long can we
make this riff go?

633
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:29,926
Till the end of time.

634
00:20:30,693 --> 00:20:32,694
(screaming)

635
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
