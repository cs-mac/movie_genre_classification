If I get the maple bacon,
that's kinda Paleo, right?

Only if you killed it
yourself with a crossbow.

7
00:01:22,341 --> 00:01:24,592
You should try the red velvet. It's new.

Oh, jeez.

No.

You think you can squeeze
an extra dollar out of me

12
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:33,268
because it's, like, "Ooh, trendy,
it looks like its bleeding"?

13
00:01:33,269 --> 00:01:35,311
No, in your heart of hearts,
you know as well as I do,

14
00:01:35,312 --> 00:01:37,438
red velvet is bullshit.

15
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,025
It tastes like Play-Doh.
It is not velvety.

16
00:01:40,026 --> 00:01:42,778
And the only thing that's good about
it is the cream cheese frosting

17
00:01:42,779 --> 00:01:45,446
which is meant to live on top of

Okay, panda. We hear you.

Red velvet isn't a thing.

Welcome to Litchfield, two-point-nothing.

30
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:40,376
So recently, we did go from,
uh, public to private,

31
00:02:40,377 --> 00:02:42,378
which is quite a relief.

00:02:48,177 --> 00:02:51,179
Yeah, I worked the night shift
at Sam's Club a while back

35
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,472
and they used to lock us in.

36
00:02:52,473 --> 00:02:54,850
Well, it was probably for
your own protection. [scoffs]

37
00:02:54,851 --> 00:02:56,309
Yeah, it didn't feel like that.

38
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,728
Well, look... [scoffs] you kidding me?

39
00:02:58,729 --> 00:03:04,109
The government socialists are clearly so
far up your butt crack about equality,

40
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:08,955
when, in code, it's all about just
giving the darker people free shit.

41
00:03:09,698 --> 00:03:13,784
It's all about private corporation
because they really look after us.

42
00:03:13,785 --> 00:03:15,536
And you get religious freedom.

43
00:03:15,537 --> 00:03:19,290
- Yeah, I'm not that religious.
- No? Well, that's too bad.

44
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:22,418
'Cause if you were a Christian, you
could tell everybody what to do,

45
00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:24,545
and then they do it so they
don't hurt your feelings,

46
00:03:24,546 --> 00:03:26,256
because that's against the law.

47
00:03:26,257 --> 00:03:27,590
[snaps fingers] Come on.

48
00:03:27,591 --> 00:03:30,635
Okay, so this right here
is Mr. Healy's office.

49
00:03:30,636 --> 00:03:32,053
He's one of the counselors.

50
00:03:32,054 --> 00:03:34,555
Now, some of the girls, they
like the black one better, okay?

51
00:03:34,556 --> 00:03:35,723
But, listen...

52
00:03:35,724 --> 00:03:38,977
He brings snacks sometimes and
he's kind of a silver fox.

53
00:03:38,978 --> 00:03:41,897
Down here, we've got visitation.
Down here, okay?

54
00:03:41,898 --> 00:03:43,773
Your family is allowed
to come and see you,

55
00:03:43,774 --> 00:03:46,535
but if they never do...

56
00:03:47,236 --> 00:03:50,571
that's probably just
'cause they're too busy.

57
00:03:50,572 --> 00:03:53,783
But they still care about you. For sure.

58
00:03:53,784 --> 00:03:55,410
For sure.

00:03:55,411 --> 00:03:57,954

There's no need to jump off the deep end.

62
00:04:02,001 --> 00:04:05,128
We got off the van,
like, five minutes ago,

63
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:06,712
and I haven't heard anybody screaming.

64
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,256

just got new mattresses, too.

everything about sewing,

00:09:11,977 --> 00:09:13,769
- Yes!
- [laughs]

167
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:17,022
- Yes! Had something to do with her taxes.
- [Poussey] Yeah, Judy King!

168
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:20,235
There was microphones everywhere.
And they almost stuck one in her ear.

169
00:09:20,236 --> 00:09:21,902
Oh, Lord, if you're really out there,

170
00:09:21,903 --> 00:09:24,239
please, please, please
let her come to Litchfield.

171
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,616
Please, please, please.

172
00:09:26,617 --> 00:09:27,959
[Crazy Eyes] Um...

173
00:09:28,785 --> 00:09:30,253
[Poussey] What?

174
00:09:31,788 --> 00:09:34,499
I think your laundry might be alive.

175
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,002
Nah, that's that furry alkie
been stealing my jail juice!

176
00:09:38,003 --> 00:09:39,962
Yeah, I caught it this morning.

177
00:09:39,963 --> 00:09:42,548
I'll turn that punk into a hat. [laughs]

178
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:43,716
What?

179
00:09:43,717 --> 00:09:47,353
Okay. We gonna have to talk.

180
00:09:48,597 --> 00:09:49,898
What?

181
00:09:52,476 --> 00:09:53,819
[sighs]

182
00:09:54,436 --> 00:09:56,604
So, stations one and two,

183
00:09:56,605 --> 00:10:00,400
you will be at the cutting tables
this morning cutting patterns.

184
00:10:00,401 --> 00:10:03,068
And then everyone else can
start assembling the pieces.

185
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:06,447
We will switch out after
lunch to avoid fatigue.

186
00:10:06,448 --> 00:10:08,491
[Anita laughs]

187
00:10:08,492 --> 00:10:12,036
Look sharp, ladies. It's up to us to
help the lovers of the world get it on!

188
00:10:12,037 --> 00:10:13,589
[scatting]

189
00:10:15,249 --> 00:10:16,541
That's enough, DeMarco.

190
00:10:16,542 --> 00:10:19,544
Come on, Donaldson. Live a little, huh?

191
00:10:19,545 --> 00:10:21,462
Cut it out, okay?

192
00:10:21,463 --> 00:10:23,464
This shit's right up my alley.

193
00:10:23,465 --> 00:10:26,509
Sewed all my kids' clothes
until high school.

194
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,519
- [chuckles]
- I bet they loved that.

195
00:10:31,014 --> 00:10:35,017
Man, somehow my khakis be
feelin' extra khaki right now.

196
00:10:35,018 --> 00:10:38,354
Oh, come on, Gonzales.
Looks are superficial.

197
00:10:38,355 --> 00:10:43,577
Everybody knows it's about talent,
originality, a sense of humor...

198
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:47,988
[both snickering]

199
00:10:47,989 --> 00:10:52,577
[snorting] What do you think it's
like to be her in real life?

200
00:10:52,578 --> 00:10:55,413
Mmm, she eats pills and ice
cream, and cries at night.

201
00:10:55,414 --> 00:10:58,383
And she cuts herself, but on
her scalp so no one can see.

202
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,751
So, it's still better than our lives.

203
00:11:00,752 --> 00:11:03,138
I would be her in a second.

204
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:11,762
[sighs] White bitches, white bitches...
All right, check it.

205
00:11:11,763 --> 00:11:14,890
How many pages you think it is
before they put in a token blackie?

206
00:11:14,891 --> 00:11:18,936
And how dark is she, scale
of one to Grace Jones?

207
00:11:18,937 --> 00:11:22,106
All right, 14 and four.

208
00:11:22,107 --> 00:11:25,067
All right, 14 and four. Let's find out.

209
00:11:25,068 --> 00:11:26,694
[exclaims]

210
00:11:26,695 --> 00:11:29,905
- So close. Here she is, page 11.
- Oh, man!

211
00:11:29,906 --> 00:11:31,657
- Man, but that's not too bad.
- Mmm-hmm.

212
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:34,044
But she, like, a two.

213
00:11:34,202 --> 00:11:36,203
- The bitch got blue eyes.
- Yeah, true.

214
00:11:36,204 --> 00:11:38,163
But, damn, look at her abs, though.

215
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:39,499
I know, right?

216
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,792
So I jump out the window.

217
00:11:41,793 --> 00:11:46,296
I fall two floors, I land
on the awning, I slide off.

218
00:11:46,297 --> 00:11:51,386
I grab the delivery boy's bicycle,
and I'm outta there. I'm gone.

219
00:11:51,387 --> 00:11:53,971
And that is how I pull off

220
00:11:53,972 --> 00:11:58,318
the biggest jewel heist
in Chandler, Arizona.

221
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:02,229
I gotta say, you are the cutest
gunslinger I've ever met.

222
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:04,356
[giggles] Thank you so much.

223
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:05,900
And I do love guns.

224
00:12:05,901 --> 00:12:09,779
I mean, the old ones...
and the newer ones.

225
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:12,532
I'm saving up for a 1962 Remington 700.

226
00:12:12,533 --> 00:12:13,741
That's the year they came out.

227
00:12:13,742 --> 00:12:16,827
Push-feed action,
3.2-millisecond lock time.

228
00:12:16,828 --> 00:12:18,954
Ooh! Just hearing you talk about that

229
00:12:18,955 --> 00:12:20,873
makes me want to go out
and shoot something.

230
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:24,419
[groans] Now you're making me sad.

231
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,305
You're never gonna be able
to buy a gun again, are you?

232
00:12:27,714 --> 00:12:28,923
What?

233
00:12:28,924 --> 00:12:34,312
As a convicted felon, you can't own a gun.

234
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:36,106
Oh, right.

235
00:12:36,807 --> 00:12:38,399
Right!

236
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:40,935
That is terrible, isn't it?

237
00:12:40,936 --> 00:12:44,146
I mean, that should be
a fundamental right.

238
00:12:44,147 --> 00:12:46,356
Like freedom of speech, right?

239
00:12:46,357 --> 00:12:48,943
I mean, what is happening to our country?

240
00:12:48,944 --> 00:12:50,695
It's the fall of Rome.

241
00:12:50,696 --> 00:12:54,207
[scoffs] Don't even get
me started on Rome.

242
00:12:55,867 --> 00:12:58,828
I've never written to an inmate before.
I didn't know what to expect.

243
00:12:58,829 --> 00:13:01,246
But you're... great.

244
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,759
[sighs] You're great, too.

245
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,167
Can I come see you again?

246
00:13:05,168 --> 00:13:07,753
I think that would be fine.

247
00:13:07,754 --> 00:13:10,089
Did you think we weren't gonna find out?

248
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:14,426
I never found out. Nobody said
a damn word to me about an ad.

249
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:16,471
All due respect, sir, but
I am gonna have to call

250
00:13:16,472 --> 00:13:18,598
a massive amount of bullshit on that.

251
00:13:18,599 --> 00:13:23,519
My kid's got asthma, and out of pocket,
her inhaler costs like $300 a month.

252
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,104
I could get heroin for cheaper.

253
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:27,231
- I understand.
- Do you?

254
00:13:27,232 --> 00:13:30,317
'Cause it seems like the only job
you saved around here was your own.

255
00:13:30,318 --> 00:13:33,153
You're still full-time. You
still have health insurance.

256
00:13:33,154 --> 00:13:38,659
You think that's what this is about, huh?
I got mine, now I'm gonna cut you loose?

257
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:41,704
It doesn't not look like that, does it?

258
00:13:41,705 --> 00:13:45,425
I guess we can put the couch on
Airbnb to pay for your wrist surgery.

259
00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:47,886
Listen to me.

260
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,464
Even if I didn't give two
shits about you clowns,

261
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:54,383
which is not the case,

262
00:13:54,384 --> 00:13:57,219
I would still want to fix this
just to get you off my jock.

263
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,638
I promise you.

264
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,818
I think that was his way of saying
he cares what happens to us.

265
00:14:03,685 --> 00:14:04,894
Exactly.

266
00:14:04,895 --> 00:14:08,073
If you care about us, you should say it.

267
00:14:09,065 --> 00:14:10,440
Say you care about us.

268
00:14:10,441 --> 00:14:11,742
No.

269
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,986
Say you love us.

270
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:16,155
What? We're family in here.

271
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:19,492
You love us and you're gonna
turn this thing around.

272
00:14:19,493 --> 00:14:20,919
Say it.

273

I love you.

[indistinct chatter]

279
00:14:41,097 --> 00:14:44,308
Hi, I would like a kosher meal, please.

280
00:14:44,309 --> 00:14:45,810
We got beef, noodles and peas.

281
00:14:45,811 --> 00:14:47,520
It's a religious thing.

282
00:14:47,521 --> 00:14:51,741
Which means Uncle Sam says you
gotta provide it when asked for.

283
00:14:52,108 --> 00:14:53,818
That's actually true.

284
00:14:53,819 --> 00:14:56,153
Well, we don't have it.

285
00:14:56,154 --> 00:14:58,447
Kosher's in extra deep freeze.

286
00:14:58,448 --> 00:15:01,701
Where it's been for months
because nobody ever asked for it

287
00:15:01,702 --> 00:15:05,580
when they were eating tasty,
nutritious Russian fusion.

288
00:15:05,581 --> 00:15:06,965
But now...

289
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:10,260
this is what it's come to.

290
00:15:20,511 --> 00:15:22,856
Some tweaker wants kosher.

291
00:15:23,765 --> 00:15:27,476
We don't got enough to deal with
around here, now we got Jews?

292

This actually looks pretty good.

295
00:15:54,588 --> 00:15:57,015
No noodles. All peas.

296
00:16:00,301 --> 00:16:03,854
- You want cake?
- Just peas. Two milk.

297
00:16:38,006 --> 00:16:40,883
Food is to be eaten in the cafeteria.

298
00:16:40,884 --> 00:16:42,885
Yeah, totally. I'm just
running out real quick.

299
00:16:42,886 --> 00:16:44,679
- I'm gonna come right back.
- Really?

300
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,472
Or are you going to stash that
cake in your locker for later

301
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:50,726
and then pretend you don't know
why there are roaches in B-Dorm?

Belonging to a race that doesn't
commit enough low-value crimes

307
00:17:52,288 --> 00:17:54,623
to be relevant in a place like this.

You Scottish.

415

treated like they're... stupid.

Well, then, don't be stupid.

a member of that category?

I do.

420
00:23:32,044 --> 00:23:35,473
But only because my options are limited.

421
00:23:41,762 --> 00:23:44,681
So I dive out the window.
I fall two floors.

I land splat on the awning.

Jump down, grab the delivery
guy's bicycle and scram.

00:27:13,391 --> 00:27:16,142
One of those things. You know, you
get the call from upstairs...

486
00:27:16,143 --> 00:27:19,145
I probably found out five
minutes before you did.

487
00:27:19,146 --> 00:27:20,897
Yeah, well, it stinks.

488
00:27:20,898 --> 00:27:23,483
Yeah, well, I 100% get why
these guys are upset.

489
00:27:23,484 --> 00:27:25,151
But, on the other hand, you know,

490
00:27:25,152 --> 00:27:27,862
keeping tabs on that many
inmates takes a toll.

491

These guys, uh, they start
making mistakes, you know.

492
00:27:31,992 --> 00:27:34,661
Cutting hours gives these
guys some down time.

493
00:27:34,662 --> 00:27:36,705
They rest up, they come in fresh...

494
00:27:36,706 --> 00:27:39,666
Yeah, to a job they no
longer give two shits about

495
00:27:39,667 --> 00:27:42,794
'cause you cut their benefits
and they're making bubkes.

[exhales] Between you and me,

498

I'm not too happy about this
whole thing, either. I mean...

499

You obviously know more about
Litchfield than anybody.

500

Who should be calling the shots?
You or some fucking corporate bigwig?

501
00:27:58,353 --> 00:28:01,605
The ad says all you need to
apply is a GED and no felonies.

502
00:28:01,606 --> 00:28:03,607
I mean, they really think
that's all it takes?

503
00:28:03,608 --> 00:28:06,326
Although, Luschek, am I right?

504
00:28:07,612 --> 00:28:10,998
[sighs] Yeah, I don't
know how that happened.

505
00:28:12,408 --> 00:28:16,411
I gotta tell you, Pearson, the last
few years have been a rough ride.

506
00:28:16,412 --> 00:28:18,463
I've been through the shit.

507
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:20,758
Can we get two more of these?

508
00:28:22,377 --> 00:28:23,460
[Pearson] I tell you what.

509
00:28:23,461 --> 00:28:28,382
The applications have been
coming to me, which is crazy.

510

You should be doing the hiring.
You know exactly what you need.

511

Who knows, maybe you'll find
some hidden gems in there.

Uh... Hey, what you got on your tray?

517
00:28:55,034 --> 00:28:58,537
Eggs and some kind of tomato sauce.

518
00:28:58,538 --> 00:29:01,623
I did not see no eggs up there.
You see eggs?

519
00:29:01,624 --> 00:29:02,957
Mmm-mmm. I did not see eggs.

520
00:29:02,958 --> 00:29:04,584
It's kosher. You gotta ask for it.

521
00:29:04,585 --> 00:29:08,171
"Kosher"? Like some pickles, "kosher"?

522
00:29:08,172 --> 00:29:10,840
No, there's all these
Jewish laws about food.

523
00:29:10,841 --> 00:29:13,718
Kosher means they obeyed all the laws.

524
00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:15,270
They make it special.

525
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,514
Well, you don't look Jewish to me.

526

I'm Lutheran. From Norway.

527
00:29:20,184 --> 00:29:23,895
But they're not allowed to ask you about
that on account of the Holocaust,

528
00:29:23,896 --> 00:29:25,781
so I don't say shit.

I know, right? And I get 45 cents
to make them.

542
00:30:02,101 --> 00:30:03,685
It's basically slave labor.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

And PS, technically,

in your commissary, throwing it in.

All right. Well, if that's all it is.

00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:28,347
With those yahoos in the lobby? Yikes.

648
00:37:28,838 --> 00:37:30,924
I don't envy your job today.

649
00:37:30,925 --> 00:37:32,716
I've never felt closer to you.

650
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:37,972
Hey, listen, I don't know what else
these MCC goons got up their sleeve,

651
00:37:37,973 --> 00:37:40,849
but I want you to know I got
full confidence in you.

652
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:44,728
I know you're doing the best that you can.
I can see that.

653
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:45,897
Thank you.

654
00:37:45,898 --> 00:37:48,357
Us old-timers gotta stick together, okay?

655
00:37:48,358 --> 00:37:50,452
I got your back all the way.

656
00:37:52,947 --> 00:37:54,706
I appreciate that.

657
00:37:55,699 --> 00:37:57,700
Good luck, all right?

658
00:37:57,701 --> 00:38:01,338
Oh, hey, uh, do me a favor and
sign this real quick for me.

659
00:38:06,126 --> 00:38:08,127
You want Reznikov back in the kitchen?

660
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:10,379
She was running a whole
black market outta there.

661
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,630
Yeah, but that wasn't proven.

662
00:38:11,631 --> 00:38:13,257
And we got all new vendors
in the kitchen now.

663
00:38:13,258 --> 00:38:17,011
And don't forget, we just lost
Gonzales to the underwear people.

664
00:38:17,012 --> 00:38:18,679
[sighs] I don't know.
I don't know, Healy.

665
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,763
I'll keep an eye on her.

666
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:23,017
She'll start off in the bottom,
washing dishes, doing the onions.

667
00:38:23,018 --> 00:38:25,153
We got a lot bigger problems, here, man.

668
00:38:26,981 --> 00:38:28,481
[pen scribbles]

669

for weakness, Counselor.

I'll keep that in mind. Side Boob!

[sewing machines whirring]

673
00:38:56,676 --> 00:38:57,977
[Piper] Huh.

674
00:38:58,178 --> 00:38:59,813
Uh, Mr. Brand?

675
00:39:00,764 --> 00:39:05,768
You know, if you smush these patterns
just a little bit closer together,

676
00:39:05,769 --> 00:39:10,189
you can actually get an extra
Lacy Low-Rider Indiscretion bikini

677
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:12,275
from the same piece of fabric.

678
00:39:12,276 --> 00:39:15,078
Thanks for your advice, inmate.

679
00:39:15,737 --> 00:39:17,664
It was really more of an observation.

680
00:39:18,032 --> 00:39:22,919
Let's just assume that Whispers Inc.
knows how they want to make panties, okay?

681
00:39:26,165 --> 00:39:27,331
[Stella] See?

682
00:39:27,332 --> 00:39:31,303
Even C-minus-looking people can be stupid.
[chuckles]

683
00:39:39,053 --> 00:39:40,386
You closin' up?

684
00:39:40,387 --> 00:39:41,845
I got time for one more.

685
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:43,482
I need my neck shaved.

686
00:39:43,932 --> 00:39:46,434
No one ever wants
anything fun around here.

687
00:39:46,435 --> 00:39:47,810
I'm guessing fun, to you,

688
00:39:47,811 --> 00:39:50,563
means a 2-foot poufy thing
with a birdcage in it?

689
00:39:50,564 --> 00:39:54,817
And what would be so terrible about that?
I mean, especially in a place like this.

690
00:39:54,818 --> 00:39:58,279
We could use some...
some originality, some sass.

691
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:01,040
Mmm-mmm. Not getting
noticed is my main goal.

692
00:40:01,658 --> 00:40:04,868
[sighs] Sass is what lands you in Seg.

693
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:06,620
[Sophia chuckles] I feel that.

694
00:40:06,621 --> 00:40:08,997
[laughing] Really? 'Cause
you doin' the opposite.

695
00:40:08,998 --> 00:40:12,501
You got this whole thing going
on, the hair, the makeup...

696
00:40:12,502 --> 00:40:16,422
I mean, who has the energy to
go full MAC counter every day?

697
00:40:16,423 --> 00:40:21,510
Listen, after all I went through to be
me, I'm not about to let shit slide.

698
00:40:21,511 --> 00:40:25,139
Yeah, but you all up in our face with
it, like all blown out and shit.

699
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:27,266
Look, if you wanted to
look like a real woman,

700
00:40:27,267 --> 00:40:31,738
you would let your roots grow out
and get some bags under your eyes.

701
00:40:32,814 --> 00:40:36,275
You know, historically,
me and reality...

702
00:40:36,276 --> 00:40:37,818
not friends.

703
00:40:37,819 --> 00:40:39,612
Mmm. You got me there.

704
00:40:39,613 --> 00:40:43,199
This one time, I'm getting on
the Metro-North to head home,

705
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,658
and this mouth-breather,

706
00:40:44,659 --> 00:40:46,702
this mouth-breather
comes right up behind me

707
00:40:46,703 --> 00:40:47,870
and smacks me on the ass.

708
00:40:47,871 --> 00:40:50,206
- And I'm thinking...
- I'm sorry, could you go back a second

709
00:40:50,207 --> 00:40:52,676
to the part where you're
on the Metro-North?

710
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:54,001
What about it?

711
00:40:54,002 --> 00:40:56,420
- Where you live?
- Yonkers.

712
00:40:56,421 --> 00:40:58,714
Childhood home of
Mary J. Blige and Anthrax.

713
00:40:58,715 --> 00:41:02,593
[chuckles] You know that my son, you
know, Benny, he's in the Bronx.

714
00:41:02,594 --> 00:41:03,719
Mmm-hmm.

715
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,970
Yeah.

716
00:41:04,971 --> 00:41:07,055
You think that maybe, um...

717
00:41:07,056 --> 00:41:10,058
he could ride up here
sometimes with your wife?

718
00:41:10,059 --> 00:41:11,227
You know, for visitation.

719
00:41:11,228 --> 00:41:13,947
'Cause he could take the
bus to their house.

720
00:41:15,524 --> 00:41:17,241
I'll ask her.

721
00:41:17,609 --> 00:41:18,910
[chuckles]

722
00:41:20,028 --> 00:41:21,820
I'm feeling sassier already.

723
00:41:21,821 --> 00:41:23,957
- Mmm-hmm?
- [chuckles]

724
00:41:24,408 --> 00:41:27,335
Glad you could come out for a real visit?

725
00:41:28,036 --> 00:41:29,796
Nice drive.

726
00:41:30,914 --> 00:41:35,093
First time in prison's always weird.
You must feel like a starling.

727
00:41:35,919 --> 00:41:37,670
A what now?

728
00:41:37,671 --> 00:41:39,588
A common starling.

729
00:41:39,589 --> 00:41:41,840
You know, how they weren't
native to America

730
00:41:41,841 --> 00:41:44,593
and then that guy Eugene
brought them over,

731
00:41:44,594 --> 00:41:47,355
'cause he wanted it to be
like Shakespeare's time.

732
00:41:48,973 --> 00:41:51,025
Right, sure.

733
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:56,564
I think I saw a hermit thrush, yesterday.

734
00:41:56,565 --> 00:41:59,826
At least, I think it was a hermit thrush.
It was all by itself.

735
00:42:00,444 --> 00:42:02,245
My uncle had a parakeet.

736
00:42:03,112 --> 00:42:06,666
Knew how to swear in Italian,
but he shit all over the house.

737
00:42:10,245 --> 00:42:13,131
You're not that into birds, are you?

738
00:42:14,123 --> 00:42:18,052
Got nothing against them, but mostly
I'm into Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.

739
00:42:18,795 --> 00:42:20,346
Like I wrote you.

740
00:42:20,714 --> 00:42:24,550
Oh, sure, Jiu-Jitsu.
Everybody loves Jiu-Jitsu.

741
00:42:24,551 --> 00:42:26,185
It's delicious.

742
00:42:29,389 --> 00:42:31,265
You wanna tell me what's going on here?

743
00:42:31,266 --> 00:42:34,352
No, nothing, nothing. Nothing's going on.
It was just a little misunderstanding...

744
00:42:34,353 --> 00:42:35,894
You think I'm some bird guy?

745
00:42:35,895 --> 00:42:37,646
- No.
- What is this? Is this a scam?

746
00:42:37,647 --> 00:42:39,315
Trying to get money or something?

747
00:42:39,316 --> 00:42:40,608
No, no, no, no, no!
It's not about money...

748
00:42:40,609 --> 00:42:41,984
I'm supposed to believe that?

749
00:42:41,985 --> 00:42:45,121

in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.

the only person that cared about me,

752
00:42:50,702 --> 00:42:53,588
they took her away to Max.

753
00:42:54,789 --> 00:42:56,800
And I'm so lonely.

754
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,545
[voice breaking] And I thought,
if I wrote to enough people,

755
00:43:01,546 --> 00:43:05,058
then maybe I would find
somebody and, oh... [sobbing]

You don't say that you
can still give hugs.

778

It's irresponsible.

Because you can't.

[Angie] "I must die now for
being the worst person.

807
00:46:09,651 --> 00:46:12,871
I accept your wisdom.

808
00:46:13,572 --> 00:46:15,206
Girl power."

809
00:46:17,742 --> 00:46:19,618
[gurgling]

810
00:46:19,619 --> 00:46:21,420
[imitates blood spurting]

811
00:46:22,872 --> 00:46:24,915
- [laughing]
- [inmates exclaiming]

812
00:46:24,916 --> 00:46:28,210
"And now I eat his... " [sighs]

813
00:46:28,211 --> 00:46:31,213
Okay, I don't feel comfortable
saying this. It's disgusting.

814
00:46:31,214 --> 00:46:33,215
Okay, okay. We can stop here.

815
00:46:33,216 --> 00:46:36,093
I did say to re-imagine old resentments,

816
00:46:36,094 --> 00:46:38,938
but I think you took this a little
too far to be constructive.

817
00:46:39,889 --> 00:46:41,098
I liked it.

818
00:46:41,099 --> 00:46:43,109
[inmates murmuring]

819
00:46:51,735 --> 00:46:53,202
All fake.

820
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:55,288
Showbiz.

821
00:46:55,822 --> 00:46:57,999
Yeah, see...

822
00:47:04,372 --> 00:47:06,373
Hey, Big Talkin' Missy.

823
00:47:06,374 --> 00:47:08,458
Out of the kitchen, into the sweatshop.

824
00:47:08,459 --> 00:47:10,293
Turns out your mobility
ain't so upwards, huh?

825
00:47:10,294 --> 00:47:12,170
Fuck off, Ruiz.

826
00:47:12,171 --> 00:47:14,214
At least my hair doesn't
smell like a deep fryer.

827
00:47:14,215 --> 00:47:15,465
[chuckles]

828
00:47:15,466 --> 00:47:18,519
Uh-uh. I'm gonna eat one of them
kosher meals y'all got back there.

829
00:47:19,345 --> 00:47:20,470
You ain't even Jewish.

830
00:47:20,471 --> 00:47:22,857
You think you know my life?

831
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:26,018
- Fine.
- [Black Cindy] Yeah.

832
00:47:26,019 --> 00:47:27,946
Shabbat shalom, bitch.

833
00:47:28,897 --> 00:47:31,273
How much longer you gonna stay mad?

834
00:47:31,274 --> 00:47:34,860
Man, do you know how hard it is to
get a squirrel into a laundry bag?

835
00:47:34,861 --> 00:47:36,403
[laughs] No.

836
00:47:36,404 --> 00:47:39,239
I took it a little too far,
hooch jacking you.

837
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:42,618
But you was pissin' and settin'
traps like Elmer Fudd.

838
00:47:42,619 --> 00:47:45,296
Man, the shit was funny.
[laughs]

839
00:47:48,457 --> 00:47:51,001
But also, I was worried about you.

840
00:47:51,002 --> 00:47:53,211
Well, you know, if I
was worried about you,

841
00:47:53,212 --> 00:47:55,673
I'd have made you some
goddamn soup or something.

842
00:47:55,674 --> 00:47:57,433
Excellent point.

843
00:47:58,051 --> 00:48:00,594
But you think you might want to
cut down on the sauce, though?

844
00:48:00,595 --> 00:48:02,512
Like, just to make sure you can?

845
00:48:02,513 --> 00:48:05,098
- I ain't hurtin' nobody.
- Um... [taps fork]

846
00:48:05,099 --> 00:48:07,976
Excuse me, Miss Poussey?
This is your liver speakin'...

847
00:48:07,977 --> 00:48:10,779
It just makes me feel better, okay?

848
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:14,868
It makes me feel like I
can get through this.

849
00:48:17,904 --> 00:48:19,538
Come with me to AA.

850
00:48:19,948 --> 00:48:21,782
- [scoffs]
- Come on, man. It'll be fun.

851
00:48:21,783 --> 00:48:23,951
You ain't even a addict!

852
00:48:23,952 --> 00:48:27,287
You just make up crazy stories about
shit that ain't even happened.

853
00:48:27,288 --> 00:48:28,413
- So?
- And then everybody

854
00:48:28,414 --> 00:48:30,666
gotta listen to you. It's
your personal open mic night.

855
00:48:30,667 --> 00:48:34,878
Well, instead of poetry slam,
it's like poetry slammer.

856
00:48:34,879 --> 00:48:36,004
No.

857
00:48:36,005 --> 00:48:39,007
[imitating Cinque] Come on,
like, "Give us, us freestyle."

858
00:48:39,008 --> 00:48:41,719
Oh, you pullin' out the
Amistad, now. Damn.

859
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:43,146
[chuckles]

860
00:48:44,097 --> 00:48:45,472
[clears throat]

861
00:48:45,473 --> 00:48:48,817
I just feel like this
place is beatin' me down.

862
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:54,439
I don't need no audience to talk at.

863
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:55,824
[chuckles]

864
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:59,745
I need a girlfriend.

865
00:49:01,823 --> 00:49:03,791
Like, a real one.

866
00:49:04,367 --> 00:49:05,751
You know?

867
00:49:08,622 --> 00:49:10,048
Love.

868
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:18,380
[woman on PA] MCC is looking to train
you for your job on the outside.

869
00:49:18,381 --> 00:49:20,766
See human resources.

870
00:49:29,768 --> 00:49:31,235
No!

871
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:34,155
[breathing heavily]

872
00:49:35,649 --> 00:49:38,025
O'Neill, I hired a new guard.

873
00:49:38,026 --> 00:49:39,652
First of many.

874
00:49:39,653 --> 00:49:43,164
And I'm gonna need you guys
to show him the ropes.

875
00:49:44,949 --> 00:49:46,960
Help yourself.

876
00:49:51,039 --> 00:49:53,206
Red velvet is shit.

877
00:49:53,207 --> 00:49:55,093
[toilet flushes]

878
00:49:59,588 --> 00:50:00,667
You like Bo Derek. Tarzan, 1981.

879
00:50:00,668 --> 00:50:03,721
Please pretend that you
didn't just see this.

880
00:50:05,115 --> 00:50:07,242
I don't see nothing.

881
00:50:07,243 --> 00:50:09,753
I just wanted to feel pretty.

882
00:50:18,295 --> 00:50:19,971
Chang?

883
00:50:22,508 --> 00:50:25,561
I'm... sorry about the other day.

884
00:50:27,388 --> 00:50:29,731
Thank you, lesbian.

885
00:50:37,689 --> 00:50:40,742
[speaking Mandarin] What do
you want us to do with him?

886
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:51,211
You will always be an ugly
girl who no one wants.

887
00:50:51,828 --> 00:50:54,330
Whether I live

888
00:50:54,331 --> 00:50:56,291
or die,

889
00:50:56,292 --> 00:50:58,594
nothing will change that.

890
00:51:01,463 --> 00:51:03,139
He's right.

891
00:51:06,802 --> 00:51:08,478
Nothing will change.

892
00:51:09,971 --> 00:51:11,263
Mei!

893
00:51:11,264 --> 00:51:12,941
What should we do with him?

894
00:51:14,726 --> 00:51:16,737
Should we let him go?

895
00:51:19,731 --> 00:51:21,366
Nah.

896
00:51:22,818 --> 00:51:24,620
Cut out his gall bladder.

897
00:51:26,697 --> 00:51:27,988
[man yelling] No!

898
00:51:27,989 --> 00:51:30,375
- [knife plunges]
- [man screaming]

899
00:51:54,182 --> 00:51:57,193
Ay, coño. Hey! Cuidado.

900
00:52:08,071 --> 00:52:09,790
I'm back.

901
00:52:11,032 --> 00:52:12,834
[punk rock playing]

902
00:52:13,089 --> 00:52:20,852
