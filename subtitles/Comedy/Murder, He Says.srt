1
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,273
There you are!

2
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,390
How was your day?
Any progress in saving the world?

3
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,193
I'm working on it.

4
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,037
You changed your mind about tonight?

5
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,959
Not really. Told you
I didn't want to miss it.

6
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,431
What happened with that dinner
with the London people?

7
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,188
-You made it sound so unavoidable.
-It was.

8
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,232
Fortunately, they missed their plane.

9
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,073
Here's to...

10
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,032
...stolen moments.

11
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,476
You look so handsome,
I better see if I can catch up.

12
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,196
Nobody home?

13
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,110
I left some Security Council
transcripts out, but everybody's gone.

14
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,757
Anything earth-shattering?

15
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,675
No, it's just important enough
not to be left out.

16
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,918
You look incredible.

17
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,678
Yeah, but we have to hurry.

18
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,308
I prefer this one.

19
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,115
Right.

20
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,717
Can I have a picture, please?

21
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,672
This way. This way, please.

22
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,633
There's Andrew. Good to see him.
Robynn, hi.

23
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,433
Steven, how are you?

24
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,153
Nice to see you.
Emily, you look wonderful.

25
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,668
Keep up the good work.

26
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,878
That's Steven Taylor
and his wife, Emily.

27
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,755
Well, at last!

28
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,632
The beautiful people have arrived.

29
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,074
Fantastic dress!

30
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,676
Thank you.

31
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,795
I didn't expect to see you tonight,
with Greenspan and all.

32
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,916
Why's that?

33
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,957
I thought you'd be
up to your ass in alligators.

34
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,476
Rumors of my death have been
greatly exaggerated.

35
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,991
All I need is her phone number.

36
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,470
Absolutely.
I must see about something.

37
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,517
Lovely!
Thank you, darling.

38
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,437
The temple's hieroglyphics
are supplications...

39
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,829
...to the gods of fertility.

40
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,997
I do believe I know his work.

41
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,596
Perhaps we could come along
to your studio one day.

42
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,349
You said he wasn't coming.

43
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,034
He changed his mind.
I tried to call you.

44
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,278
What are we going to do?

45
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,869
Nothing. Just relax.

46
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,148
-He doesn't know who I am, right?
-No.

47
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,478
You're a peach.

48
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,072
Lunch tomorrow?

49
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,273
And tomorrow...

50
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,913
...and tomorrow.

51
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,155
I leave you alone for 30 seconds
and you elope with a younger man.

52
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,278
Steven, I'd like to
introduce you to David Shaw.

53
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,919
Pleasure! Nice to meet you.

54
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,195
David is a painter.

55
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,677
I saw some of his pieces downtown.
I thought they were amazing.

56
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,474
What brings you uptown to our
little inbred soirée?

57
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,270
Actually, Emily was kind enough
to wrangle me an invite.

58
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,748
Me too.

59
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,757
So tell me about your work...

60
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,029
...David?

61
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,550
A couple small galleries
carry me when there's space.

62
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,798
-You studied formally?
-Berkeley, Cal Arts.

63
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,508
Almost formally graduated too.

64
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,352
Too much study pollutes the soul.

65
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,596
-And he's good?
-He's wonderful.

66
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,037
I'd love to see your pieces.
Maybe we can arrange a time.

67
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,113
-Whenever you want.
-Emily has your number?

68
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,637
No. The gallery can get ahold of me.
You know which one?

69
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,119
Yes.

70
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,433
If you're as good as she says...

71
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,274
...l'll pass the word on
to my acquisitive friends.

72
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,353
Thanks. That's very generous.

73
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,069
Nice to meet you.

74
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,749
You too.

75
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,473
Pleasure to see you.

76
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,632
We cannot be held accountable...

77
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,037
...for the actions of others
that require us to defend ourselves.

78
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,994
Madame Ambassador.

79
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,759
It's the same speech he gave in
Geneva 3 months ago, word for word.

80
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,633
Showoff.

81
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,875
-Good morning, how are you?
-Fine, thank you.

82
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,754
Steven, spreads are blowing out.

83
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:35,157
The way things look in Europe,
it could turn into a bloodbath.

84
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,035
-So what are we talking?
-At least 1 50 basis points.

85
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,753
The Bundesbank will have to tag along.

86
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,719
Your yen and mark positions
will get hammered.

87
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,593
So what's our exposure?

88
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,592
Based on my preliminary trend model?

89
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,159
Yes. No frills.

90
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,152
Think Chernobyl.

91
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,070
Greenpoint, next stop.

92
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,829
What you got there?

93
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,672
It's a little surprise.

94
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,673
Come on up.

95
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,073
Here's your fortune.

96
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,433
"You have a deep interest
in all that is artistic."

97
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,514
It's true.

98
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,871
You didn't have to get this for me.

99
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,708
You need a little civilizing.

100
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,273
What do you need?

101
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,079
What do you need?

102
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,872
You know, we could be in Belize
this time tomorrow.

103
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,999
Belize.

104
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,192
You ever been there?

105
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,515
You'd think you'd died
and went to heaven.

106
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,671
But I already think that.

107
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,876
You look so pretty today.

108
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,236
Hey, it's David. Leave one.
I'll get back to you.

109
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,916
David, hi. It's Steven Taylor.
I'm finishing a little early today.

110
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,993
I thought I might come by
and check out your work.

111
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,151
Say about six.

112
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,710
If that flies with you, call me
at my office here at 5-4-4-...

113
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,678
... 1-8-1-7.

114
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,236
I look forward to seeing you.

115
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,951
What are you going to do?

116
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,476
I guess I'll call him.

117
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,949
Be kind of weird if I didn't,
wouldn't it?

118
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,869
You're playing with fire, David.

119
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,677
If you're so upset about it,
why'd you give him my number?

120
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,512
I didn't.

121
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,473
Mr. Taylor?

122
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,833
Hi. Here, sit down.

123
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,950
That was stupid. Sorry about that.

124
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,998
Thanks very much.

125
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,670
Drink?

126
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,878
No, I'm okay.

127
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,951
Unless you want another one.

128
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,748
I just had us meet here
because my place is hard to find.

129
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,792
Like an illegal loft space?

130
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,639
That's one way to put it.

131
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,671
I feel like I'm knee-deep
in bohemian cachet.

132
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,234
Lead on.

133
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,993
-How's Emily?
-She's fine, thank you.

134
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,351
Well, be sure and say "hi."

135
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,919
I will.

136
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,468
One more.
One more floor.

137
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,228
Building's over 100 years old now.

138
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,673
Watch your step.

139
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,518
I can certainly see
what Emily was drawn to.

140
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,274
Yeah? What's that?

141
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,592
Your work. It's...

142
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,797
...very trashy...

143
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,310
...but potent.

144
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,635
Trashy?

145
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,473
Is that what she said?

146
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,799
Your anger...

147
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,079
...it's very controlled.

148
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,318
You think I'm angry?

149
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,597
The anger in your work.

150
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,350
The color of despair.

151
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,271
Wonder where that comes from.

152
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,873
I don't know.

153
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,038
Inside, I guess.

154
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,309
Inside...

155
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,675
...indeed.

156
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,189
Nowhere to sit but the goddamned bed.

157
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,597
You know, I envy you.

158
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,308
You envy me?

159
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,913
You should be...

160
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,668
...flattered.
I'm not prone to envy.

161
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,639
It's a pathetic emotion.

162
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,195
Sneaks up on you like cancer.

163
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,032
I've got it and you know why.

164
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,396
No.

165
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,278
Oh, of course you do.

166
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,911
One of life's legitimately
sublime experiences. It's so...

167
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,358
...utterly complete.

168
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,470
What?

169
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,271
Fucking my wife.

170
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,872
Mr. Taylor, I don't know...

171
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,032
I think it's about time
you called me Steven.

172
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,078
We're in love, sir.

173
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,273
That's it?

174
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,469
That's it?

175
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,636
You steal the crown jewel
of a man's soul...

176
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,993
...and your only excuse is some
candy-ass Hallmark card sentiment?

177
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,350
Even if it was true,
that's not good enough!

178
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,679
If what were true?

179
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,239
She is in love.

180
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,475
You, buddy...

181
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,988
...you're in business.

182
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,389
What the hell are you saying?

183
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,712
I'm saying you did not meet
my wife by chance.

184
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,194
I'm saying
you didn't study at Berkeley.

185
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,477
I'm saying you learned to paint while
doing 3 to 6 in Soledad Prison...

186
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:41,872
...for relieving a widow
in San Francisco of her life savings.

187
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,354
Your second conviction...

188
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,957
...if I'm not mistaken.

189
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,829
Your real name is Winston Lagrange,
which I rather like.

190
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,078
Born to pure trailer trash
in Barstow, California.

191
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,231
Ward of the courts
since the age of ten.

192
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:01,109
You went from pickpocket to car thief
to con man till you found out...

193
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,079
...that you had a way
with the softer sex.

194
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,872
No doubt looking for that mother
you can barely remember.

195
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,036
A life made up completely
of depressing little scams...

196
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,156
...until now.

197
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,879
Where'd you get all that?

198
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,078
All that is for sale.
The hell of it is, you're not...

199
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,476
...half-bad with a brush.

200
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,718
Called rehabilitation.

201
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,429
It's called a con.
My wife's the grand prize.

202
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,234
But you set your sights
too high this time.

203
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,438
She loves me.

204
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,472
She loves David Shaw,
your invention.

205
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,309
But you've made
a fundamental miscalculation.

206
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,715
Play it out.

207
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,513
Love conquers all.

208
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,394
Emily divorces me.
She marries you.

209
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:48,478
Given your history, her advisors
are going to insist upon a prenup.

210
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,038
You might storm the castle...

211
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,158
...but you ain't getting the keys
to the treasure room, ever.

212
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,714
I don't care about that.

213
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,470
The swindler doesn't care about a
trust fund that can buy Barstow?

214
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,318
Why don't you cut the shit!

215
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,472
You care, or we would not be having
this conversation!

216
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,592
The only thing that stops you from
bolting now is bad genes and greed.

217
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,554
Now what?

218
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,799
Choices.

219
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,836
I can tell Emily who you are,
and life will imitate art.

220
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,871
You become a starving painter,
game over.

221
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,589
Or?

222
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,437
Or you can cash out.

223
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,519
Cash out?

224
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,233
Half a million dollars.

225
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,479
Tax-free.

226
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,270
Just for walking away from her?

227
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,274
I said tax-free.
I didn't say free.

228
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,511
What's 500 grand for?

229
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,151
Killing my wife.

230
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,555
Emily?

231
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,594
Imagine my embarrassment
if they're not the same.

232
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,796
$100,000 now...

233
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,913
...$400,000 after, cash-and-carry.

234
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,232
You're out of your mind.

235
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,518
Not really.

236
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:21,956
Why?

237
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:27,271
I appreciate your curiosity,
but my agenda doesn't concern you.

238
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,238
I'll go straight to Emily
and tell her all this.

239
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,551
That would be my word against yours...

240
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,875
...Winston.

241
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,031
And what if I call the cops?

242
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,669
Have you ever been
to Boca Raton, Florida?

243
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,559
A lady there was carrying on
with a younger man.

244
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,549
He was a hell of a tennis player.
When the affair ended...

245
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,479
...he disappeared...

246
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,479
...along with the lady's bearer bonds.

247
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,113
You sure you've never been there?

248
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,277
Not that I recall.

249
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,472
An acquaintance of mine has
a photograph of the suspect.

250
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,996
All they need is a name...

251
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,471
...as in, strike three.

252
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,074
1 5 years.

253
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,038
No parole.

254
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:32,112
You think you got a box big enough
to hold $100,000 in cash?

255
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,836
Come by the apartment
around 1 2 o'clock tomorrow.

256
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,438
Unless you have
a previous luncheon engagement.

257
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,315
I assume you know where I live.

258
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,314
I'm your best friend!

259
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,318
Half the year goes by
and you don't say one thing?

260
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,755
Do you love him?
Will you leave Steven?

261
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,309
Talk to me.

262
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,516
I will if you shut up for one second.

263
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,678
I'm waiting.

264
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,350
I didn't tell you
because you adore Steven.

265
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,477
You cried at our wedding,
for God's sake.

266
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,473
-I cry at every wedding.
-No, you don't.

267
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,516
You like the idea of us.

268
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,392
Everybody does.

269
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,989
But you have no idea who he is.

270
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,396
-I know Steven.
-No, you don't.

271
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:16,156
You don't know that everything
always has to be on his terms.

272
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:20,274
You don't know that he has
no real interest in who I am.

273
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,435
What are you going to do?

274
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,073
I don't know.

275
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,797
I'm going to figure out a way
to tell him. He deserves that.

276
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,877
What makes you think he doesn't know?

277
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,798
Because there's no way.

278
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,675
I mean, he knows that
something's not right but...

279
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,756
Does David have a last name?

280
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,352
Shaw. David Shaw.

281
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,030
And he knows about your family?

282
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,878
What do you mean?

283
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,830
What do you think I mean?

284
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,032
We don't talk about that kind of stuff.

285
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,038
In six months,
you never mentioned money?

286
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,355
No!

287
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,437
Believe me, okay?

288
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:08,111
David has absolutely no interest
in anything other than painting...

289
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,553
...and me.

290
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,273
And you.

291
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,636
Is that why you're not wearing
your wedding ring?

292
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,793
Oh, my God!

293
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,870
What?

294
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,272
I left it at David's.

295
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,479
Working late?

296
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,637
No, I was having a drink with Raquel.

297
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,196
And how is the Castilian femme fatale?

298
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,951
By the way, I saw your friend
David this evening.

299
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,469
Really?

300
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,917
He honored me with a visit
at his industrial hideaway.

301
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,030
You're kidding.

302
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,750
And where's that?

303
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,712
Greenpoint, Brooklyn.

304
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,479
How'd you get his number?

305
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:06,230
I called some of those
obscure galleries you prowl...

306
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,317
...dropped your name.

307
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,796
You're right.

308
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,912
He's very talented.

309
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,799
Did you buy anything?

310
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,798
I made him an offer.

311
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,875
And?

312
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,030
And he's chewing on it.

313
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,753
Good morning.

314
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,870
-Hi, it's me.
-Hey, how you doing?

315
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,276
-I left my wedding ring.
-I know.

316
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,471
I put it away before he got here.

317
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,273
Thank God!

318
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,033
What did you guys talk about?

319
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,555
He wasn't here that long,
so just the work.

320
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,159
He didn't have a clue.

321
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,313
He said that he made you an offer.

322
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,914
Matter of fact, he did.

323
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,235
What piece?

324
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,755
It's one you haven't seen.

325
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,873
I thought I'd seen all of them.

326
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,752
Well, almost.

327
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:43,235
Listen, turns out I got to take
a rain check on lunch today.

328
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,318
-Why? What's wrong?
-Nothing, nothing.

329
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,074
Some people want to see my sketches...

330
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,918
...and it'd be a good commission.

331
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,948
You sound funny.

332
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,389
Do I?

333
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,749
Yeah.

334
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,795
I guess it's called
being broke, sweetheart.

335
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,273
Tomorrow, then.

336
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,512
Reservation for two.

337
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,711
Quiet table, in back.

338
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,319
Very quiet.

339
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,914
You know I love you.

340
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,673
I know.

341
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,035
Bye.

342
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,518
-Is that by...?
-Yeah.

343
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,992
People with money
always go for the same things.

344
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,552
And what are those?

345
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,557
Anything, everything,
as long as it's recognizable.

346
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,796
Don't worry. None of this
would've been yours anyway.

347
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,992
Everything you see here, it's mine.

348
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,874
Why don't you drop that
there and come here.

349
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,953
That's nice.

350
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,479
There was a robbery
in the building last year.

351
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,751
Probable means of entrance...

352
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,917
...was this driveway gate.

353
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,829
That granite façade creates a blind
spot on the surveillance cameras.

354
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,951
It was never corrected,
for aesthetic reasons.

355
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,389
How do you know that?

356
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,318
I'm on the board.

357
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,709
You enter as I leave at 8 p.m.

358
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,958
I won't pull out of the driveway
till it's clear.

359
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,111
The gate takes 5 seconds to close.

360
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,039
Hug the right side of the wall
as I drive by.

361
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,511
Then you enter the stairs
by the service elevator.

362
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:14,992
The key to the front door also works
here for the service entrance.

363
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,878
I'm going to take the key from
Emily's purse before I leave...

364
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,678
...and I'll put it in this...

365
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,992
...and hide it here,
right behind the pipe.

366
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,598
-Where're you going to be?
-At my regular card game.

367
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,274
Why don't you leave me your key?

368
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:40,028
My key implicates me.
Her key implicates no one.

369
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,077
It could've been lost or stolen.

370
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,232
In any case, she won't
be around to explain.

371
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,919
Why not make a copy of the key?

372
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,237
It's two loose ends,
the key and the locksmith.

373
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:56,078
This door is always bolted. She
won't notice, even if she checks it.

374
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,590
You'll be in the stairwell at 9:30.

375
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,758
By that time, Emily
will be taking her bath.

376
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,519
She will? How do you know?

377
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:07,156
Because that's what she does
on nights that I play cards.

378
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,673
Why not do it in the tub?

379
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,194
Because that'll look like
cold-blooded murder.

380
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,671
It has to appear that
she surprised the intruder.

381
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,114
All right?

382
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,871
This is a separate telephone line.

383
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,596
Exactly 10 p.m., I will call here.

384
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,110
Emily will answer the phone.

385
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,997
You will enter.

386
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,797
A tragic confrontation will ensue.

387
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,632
It should appear to be...

388
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,319
...stupid...

389
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,677
...and spur-of-the-moment.

390
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:46,992
I've always thought "bludgeon"
has a spur-of-the-moment sound.

391
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,554
Maybe you could use one of these.

392
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,520
Rifle the jewelry in the bedroom.

393
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:57,110
Disable the service entrance lock.
Make it look like it was jimmied.

394
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,870
Put the key back under the pipe,
then leave the way you came in.

395
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,036
And what happens
if the plan goes to hell?

396
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,713
It won't.

397
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,718
So when is this card game of yours?

398
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,439
-Tomorrow night.
-Tomorrow?

399
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,119
No fucking way!

400
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,358
A man with your résumé should
come up with an alibi in no time.

401
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,392
100 thousand.

402
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,032
A man with my résumé should
take the money and run.

403
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,754
Bet you 400 thousand more you don't.

404
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,676
Yes, I understand that.

405
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,030
But if we can't get numbers
on refugee density...

406
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,709
...then we can't position
the resources to deal with it.

407
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,795
I'll tell her to expect it
later today. Thank you.

408
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,590
That's not happiness to see me, is it?

409
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,919
Try surprise.

410
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,952
I had a hole in my schedule...

411
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,596
...and I thought lunch with my
beautiful wife would be indicated.

412
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,873
But I guess you have other plans.

413
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,156
-What makes you say that?
-You seem in such a hurry.

414
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,589
It's just errands.

415
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,950
Like shopping for a new wedding ring.

416
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,231
One of the settings felt loose...

417
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,829
...so I took it in.
It'll be ready tomorrow.

418
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,031
And what if there were no tomorrow?

419
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,154
What does that mean?

420
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,757
Wouldn't you regret not having
one last lunch with your husband?

421
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,873
Of course.

422
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,837
-Enjoy your meal.
-Thank you very much.

423
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,439
I must reply to Francesca about
this weekend. Want to do it?

424
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,672
All right, we'll go out...

425
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:31,317
I got to break this up.
Excuse me one minute.

426
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:34,156
Hey, it's David. Leave one.
I'll get back to you.

427
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,109
David?

428
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,317
He was waiting for me...

429
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,390
...to take me to lunch.

430
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,551
There was nothing I could do.

431
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,920
I can't do this anymore.
I've got to tell him tonight.

432
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,749
Hi, I'm here.

433
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,715
I'm really sorry.

434
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,550
It's okay.

435
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,678
He's never done that before.
Something's wrong. He knows.

436
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,353
No, he doesn't.

437
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,392
Don't let your mind
get away from you.

438
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,998
I cannot live like this anymore.

439
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,152
It's not fair to him.
I've got to tell him.

440
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,431
Tell him what, exactly?

441
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,438
Tell him everything, tonight.

442
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,990
We've waited this long.
Hold off another day...

443
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,476
...so we can figure it out together.

444
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,756
You know?

445
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,678
So I can help you.

446
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,675
I don't know.

447
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,114
I do.

448
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,833
I do know.

449
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,911
Honey, don't panic.

450
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,031
Good night, Mr. Taylor.

451
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,469
I'm on my way.

452
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,150
Everything's prepared for you.

453
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,955
Give my best to Mrs. Taylor.

454
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,870
So how was the rest of your day?

455
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,872
Fairly brutal.

456
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,877
I'm sorry to hear about that.

457
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,912
I don't want you to go tonight.

458
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,674
What's wrong?

459
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,631
I'd like to talk to you.

460
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,713
It's too late.

461
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,790
They'll never get anybody to fill in.

462
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:07,238
Besides, I beat them last week.
They'll want their money back.

463
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,312
You scared me.

464
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,991
I just wanted to say goodbye.

465
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,835
I'll call you later.

466
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:07,873
I might go to Nick's for a burger.
If nobody's here, don't worry.

467
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:12,792
I won't,
but you might want to reconsider.

468
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,359
Why is that?

469
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,870
I had Janice make
one of her legendary roasts.

470
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,555
Really?

471
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,998
Thought we'd eat before the game.

472
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,868
Wish me luck.

473
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,159
Good luck.

474
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,633
$1,000 to you, George.

475
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,909
Fold.

476
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,398
-Call.
-Down and dirty.

477
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,312
Last one, gentlemen.

478
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,230
-Got to have more than that.
-Three sixes still bets.

479
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:07,196
-Gentlemen, same game.
-It's getting a little boring.

480
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,794
I'm out.

481
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,396
Must be morning in Hong Kong.

482
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,549
There's my cards.

483
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,196
Let's have a better hand this time.

484
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,199
You've got to be kidding me.

485
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,191
That's a serious bet.

486
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,438
Who is this?

487
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,068
I'm in.

488
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:48,433
-Put your money up, here we go.
-Just in time!

489
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:51,069
Different winner this time,
though, guys.

490
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:52,834
I liked the last one.

491
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,318
Oh, my God!

492
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:29,274
-What happened?
-Mrs. Taylor, we have your location.

493
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,112
He's in the kitchen.

494
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,112
Please stay on the line.

495
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,718
Ma'am? Ma'am?

496
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:43,634
Oh, Jesus!

497
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,198
Police! Open up!

498
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:10,788
Open up!

499
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:13,998
-Mr. Taylor?
-We're all right.

500
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,879
He's in the kitchen.
I think he's dead. Follow me.

501
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:31,717
You didn't hear any...

502
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:34,470
...strange sounds...

503
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:38,154
...prior to your entering the kitchen?

504
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:41,476
No, just the phone call.

505
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:44,433
But before that, nothing unusual?

506
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:55,072
-How you guys doing?
-We're pretty set here.

507
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:57,555
I want you to dust the elevator cage...

508
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:59,672
...and the banister.

509
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:02,912
Mo, be out of here in 1 5, 20 minutes.

510
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:05,869
Maybe.

511
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,031
-Detective Karaman.
-Steven Taylor.

512
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,396
Pleasure, sir.
Mind if I ask you a few questions?

513
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:18,829
No. Not at all.

514
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:21,596
I noticed what I assume
to be your footprints...

515
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:23,990
...in the blood around the deceased.

516
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,716
-Can I assume those are yours?
-Yes, you may.

517
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,313
May I ask what you were doing?

518
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,352
Making sure he was dead.

519
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:33,636
Was he?

520
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,558
Appeared to be, yes.

521
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:36,875
Take his pulse?

522
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:38,756
No.

523
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,150
You see right there?

524
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,797
Did you lean over him for something?

525
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,395
I tried to determine whether
he was breathing.

526
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:51,114
-Was he?
-Not at that time.

527
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:52,509
Let's take a look.

528
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:16,674
Something wrong?

529
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:21,838
Aside from a dead man
lying in my kitchen?

530
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,752
For a moment,
I thought you knew the man.

531
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:27,151
-I don't think so.
-Why's that?

532
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:30,078
I never forget a face.

533
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:31,190
Anything else?

534
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:32,310
No.

535
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:35,116
Your wife must come down
to give a statement.

536
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:36,230
When?

537
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:37,708
As soon as she's ready.

538
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:38,990
Mr. Taylor...

539
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:42,232
...are you aware of anyone
who might wish your wife harm?

540
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:44,830
My wife has no enemies.

541
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:47,959
Thanks, Detective.

542
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,591
I know, baby, I know.

543
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,394
It's okay.

544
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:06,717
You're going to be all right.

545
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,439
What do you think?

546
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,279
I believe her.

547
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:19,959
What about him?

548
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:25,038
I couldn't say.

549
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:30,635
You know, Mo...

550
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:34,875
...rich people are different
from you and me.

551
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:36,195
How?

552
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,153
They got a fuck of a lot more money,
for one thing.

553
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,832
Very good, Bobby.

554
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,270
Hey, Mo, you going to turn it up,
or what?

555
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,637
I like it like this.

556
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:43,959
You had said before...

557
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:47,149
...that they did not speak.

558
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:48,509
They didn't.

559
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:49,994
They listened.

560
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:52,197
Background noise?
Did you hear any?

561
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,550
There wasn't any.
She told you.

562
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:57,308
Maybe you should let your wife
answer the questions.

563
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:59,551
She's been through enough tonight.

564
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:03,036
We're almost through, Mrs. Taylor.

565
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:06,437
There's just a few more things
I'd like to ask.

566
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,951
Remember what time you got home,
Mr. Taylor?

567
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:15,914
1 1, 1 1:30. Came from my regular
card game at the Drake Club.

568
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:21,309
You'll love this.

569
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,316
We've I.D.'d the man
who broke into your home.

570
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:31,636
May I?

571
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:32,710
Sure.

572
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:37,798
This man is a career criminal.

573
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:41,550
You couldn't dream up a better
defense for justifiable homicide.

574
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:46,469
Your wife's on three.
She says it's an emergency.

575
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:06,276
How old is your boy?

576
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:11,308
One month.

577
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:12,869
Is he ill?

578
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:14,719
Colic.

579
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,076
May God watch over your son
and protect him.

580
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:18,715
And you as well.

581
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:21,955
I'm glad we cleared that up.

582
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:25,790
I'm going to ask you
not to leave the city.

583
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:28,515
But she is.

584
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:31,752
We're going to her mother's house.
Roger has the telephone number.

585
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:32,995
Wait. Hold on.

586
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,714
Why? She hasn't been charged.
Her statement's complete.

587
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:38,190
So it's really just a matter
of courtesy.

588
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:39,714
Courtesy on our part.

589
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:44,192
If you think of anything else,
give me a ring.

590
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,078
I don't know what else
there is to think of.

591
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,198
Probably nothing.

592
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:52,668
May you go in safety.

593
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:54,399
And you as well.

594
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,392
My baby!

595
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:09,711
I'm just down the hall, baby.

596
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:49,953
Here you go.

597
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:55,712
By tomorrow, this will all seem
like a bad dream.

598
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,515
And what if there were no tomorrow?

599
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:13,876
You know better than that.

600
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,318
Sleep well.

601
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:39,238
Please tell me.

602
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:41,472
How could something like this happen?

603
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:43,438
Sandra, I don't know.

604
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:46,871
I've gone over it
a thousand times myself.

605
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,077
The world's gone crazy.

606
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:21,551
Roger's prepared a statement
the D.A. wants me to sign.

607
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:24,268
So I'll head back into the city...

608
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:26,432
...and come back in the morning
to pick up Emily...

609
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,676
...if she's all right.

610
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:33,873
It's me.

611
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:37,949
I just wanted to tell you I'm okay.

612
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:43,835
I'm not in the city,
but I'll call as soon as I can.

613
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:47,319
I love you.

614
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:55,157
I don't want her to be rushed.

615
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:12,078
No, of course not.

616
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,118
I don't want her to be rushed either.

617
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:16,430
I'm going to check on our patient.

618
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:49,152
Sorry, David.
Emily's resting right now.

619
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:52,631
But I think we've got
something to talk about.

620
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:25,719
Who was he?

621
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:29,715
Somebody I met at Berkeley.

622
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:32,830
Can he be connected to you?

623
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,318
Not anymore.

624
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:44,354
You got any idea
who you're fucking with?

625
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:47,715
Yeah.

626
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:50,032
You hired me
to kill your wife...

627
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:51,952
...because you couldn't
do the wet work yourself.

628
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:54,472
Well, neither could I.

629
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:00,196
So how do you know
he didn't talk to someone?

630
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:02,838
Ron was a good man.

631
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:05,076
Not quite good enough.

632
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:16,037
So what's plan B?

633
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:19,957
It's a little coincidental
if there's another attempt on her life.

634
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:21,912
Gee, you think?

635
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:25,748
So we wait.

636
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:27,753
For what?

637
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:31,278
I'll let you know.

638
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,072
Do I keep fucking your wife
in the meantime, or what?

639
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:56,599
Thank you, Charles.

640
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:03,516
Steven called while you were asleep.

641
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:06,109
He's getting everything ready
for you to come home.

642
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:09,799
He wants to send the car
for you tomorrow.

643
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:11,912
I'm not going home.

644
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:15,998
I'm going to move in with Raquel
for a while.

645
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:19,637
Em, what's going on?

646
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:23,391
I'm leaving Steven.

647
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:57,795
They've started liquidating
your long positions to cover.

648
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:00,349
Which ones?

649
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:02,119
DMG and Barclays.

650
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:04,158
Why didn't anybody tell me?

651
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:07,432
We tried, Steven.
We couldn't find you.

652
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:09,831
I said no calls!

653
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:43,475
Albert.

654
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:47,232
-May I please have our house key?
-Sure, Mrs. Taylor.

655
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:49,189
What happened to yours?

656
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:51,516
I've absolutely no idea.
It doesn't work.

657
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:54,358
Did my husband change the locks?

658
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,876
No, not that I know of.

659
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:11,514
Emily, it's me.

660
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:14,150
I didn't hear you come in.

661
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:16,277
You left the front door wide open.

662
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:20,915
Don't.

663
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:24,438
I'm your husband.

664
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:29,188
Oh, God! I can't stay here.

665
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:32,790
It's all right.
We'll get out of here tonight.

666
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:35,717
I can't stay with you, Steven.

667
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,956
I can't stay with you anymore.

668
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:41,153
Raquel's waiting for me downstairs.

669
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:57,790
Okay, there are fresh towels
in the bathroom...

670
01:06:58,040 --> 01:06:59,837
...and you can have anything
you want in the fridge...

671
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:01,718
...including your favorite yogurt.

672
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:04,397
Let me ask you a question.

673
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:09,229
What do you think Steven would do
if he knew about David?

674
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:18,315
Screwing around is the
second oldest reason to kill somebody.

675
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:20,830
Really?
And what would be the first?

676
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:23,319
Money, honey.

677
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:30,153
But Steven's rich...

678
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:33,830
...and with your money,
you must've had a prenup.

679
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:39,117
Tell me you had a prenup.

680
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:41,877
He offered. I said no.

681
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:46,834
So if you die, he gets, like...

682
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:48,513
...a hundred million bucks?

683
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:51,071
Something like that.

684
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:56,159
Lucky guy.

685
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:16,874
I assume you have a very good reason
for asking me to do this.

686
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:21,234
We'll sure miss you around here.

687
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:23,109
Come.

688
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:26,475
Come and see me on your way out.

689
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:29,593
This is Robert Harrington.

690
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:33,316
Bobby is the Deputy Director
of the Commodities Trade Commission.

691
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:34,794
Please.

692
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:37,991
Take all the time you need.

693
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:47,273
Mrs. Taylor...

694
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:50,278
...passing this kind of information,
even to a spouse...

695
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:52,033
...is unethical.

696
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:53,679
I understand.

697
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:59,754
Your husband has been buying U.S.
and foreign bonds on margin...

698
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:02,315
...and using those securities
as collateral.

699
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:04,429
That's illegal.

700
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:08,189
In fact, his company's been under
investigation for almost a year.

701
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:09,949
Some months ago...

702
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:12,595
...U.S. interest rates
started moving against him.

703
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:15,713
He should've gotten some horrific
margin calls...

704
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,673
...but the banks he's in bed with
have hidden the losses...

705
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:21,190
...hoping that things
will turn around.

706
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:23,278
It isn't happening.

707
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:25,433
Sooner or later...

708
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:28,029
...those margin calls will come.

709
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:30,908
And when they do,
your husband will be...

710
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:32,794
...wiped out.

711
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:57,638
Yep, where's the subpoena?

712
01:09:57,880 --> 01:10:00,075
But I can't get
the records without it.

713
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:02,911
I've waited two days.

714
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:07,079
Just get back to me.

715
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:12,032
-Detective.
-Please sit down.

716
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:17,154
To what do I owe the pleasure,
Mrs. Taylor?

717
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:22,149
I have some information
about my husband.

718
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:23,435
Concerning?

719
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:28,397
It seems he's in
serious financial trouble...

720
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:30,989
...and he was hiding it from me.

721
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:33,311
And I thought that...

722
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:35,798
...might be a possible reason...

723
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:37,754
...a possible reason for him to...

724
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:39,439
Hire someone to kill you?

725
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:41,988
Yes.

726
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:47,708
I know what you're worth,
Mrs. Taylor...

727
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:51,157
...and that kind of money
is always a motive.

728
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:53,595
Do you mean he's already a suspect?

729
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:55,233
Was.

730
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:59,276
Until we traced a phone call he made
the night you were attacked.

731
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:02,631
The trace led us to an automated
quote system at his office.

732
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:07,239
It lasted from five minutes
before ten to nine minutes after.

733
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:09,875
That has to be one of the cleaner
alibis I've come across.

734
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:13,630
I took your case apart
a thousand times...

735
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:15,399
...then I put it back together again.

736
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:18,069
There was always one piece left...

737
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:19,509
...1ike a screw that didn't fit.

738
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:23,509
The dead man had a wallet,
cash and change, driver's license...

739
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:26,234
...membership card
to a video store, but...

740
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:28,192
...not a single key.

741
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:30,119
Not one.

742
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:33,070
Not even to his apartment.

743
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:40,393
Elliot, it's a zero-sum game.
You don't have the balls for it.

744
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:43,996
By tomorrow, neither of us
will have any balls left.

745
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:46,071
-Don't panic.
-You're damn right I am.

746
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:48,436
You drop 50 million in a day.

747
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:50,477
You know how fast 50 becomes 500?

748
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:52,878
Not now. What's the spot rate?

749
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:55,076
We're sitting at ground zero.

750
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:57,038
You're telling me,
"Think happy thoughts"?

751
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:58,429
I said, not now!

752
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:02,030
I'm sorry, but I have a caller
who says this is an emergency.

753
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:03,633
He says it concerns Emily.

754
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:08,913
-Who is it?
-He won't identify himself.

755
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:14,679
Who is this?

756
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:18,120
A tragic confrontation will ensue.

757
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:21,152
It should appear to be...

758
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:22,839
...stupid and...

759
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:24,952
...spur-of-the-moment.

760
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:28,596
I've always thought that "bludgeon"
has a spur-of-the-moment sound.

761
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:32,270
Maybe you could use one of these.

762
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:39,238
Meet me at the diner at the corner
of Maiden and South.

763
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:40,908
Right now.

764
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:49,671
He was a con named Ronald Diggs.

765
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:52,520
Fresh from state prison in California.

766
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:13,794
Must be hard for you.

767
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:47,952
Mr. Taylor.

768
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:51,750
You didn't get those fancy shoes
dirty walking over here, did you?

769
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:53,354
What do you want?

770
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:55,278
The rest of my money.

771
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:59,277
You didn't fulfill your end
of the bargain, did you?

772
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:01,236
So?

773
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:03,559
So what do I get?

774
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,556
You get this superfine thing.

775
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:08,990
Hell, you might even call it...

776
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:10,509
What was that?

777
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:12,239
"Legitimately sublime."

778
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:16,392
What exactly is this superfine thing?

779
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:17,795
You're looking at it.

780
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:20,679
It's called time outside of prison,
old partner.

781
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:22,632
You can't beat it with a stick.

782
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:30,631
Exactly how much time
does $400,000 buy me?

783
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:35,310
Whatever the market will bear.

784
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:40,479
It'll take me a few days.

785
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:43,434
You got four hours.

786
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:45,717
That's impossible and you know it.

787
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:48,793
Come on, Steve.

788
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:52,675
A man with your résumé should
come up with 400 grand in no time.

789
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:57,430
Where?

790
01:14:57,720 --> 01:14:59,073
My place.

791
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:01,676
You don't show up with the cash...

792
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:05,475
...l'll do a mailing of
Steven's greatest hits.

793
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:08,199
I understand.

794
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:16,075
Make fucking sure you do.

795
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:45,559
Hey, Blondie!

796
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:46,830
What are you doing here?

797
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:48,356
Excuse me.

798
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:50,915
I'm looking for apartment 209.

799
01:15:58,640 --> 01:15:59,868
This way?

800
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:02,350
Thank you.

801
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:10,793
There's a blonde coming up.

802
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:12,355
Leave her alone.

803
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:14,190
A blonde?

804
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:15,634
Send her right up!

805
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:57,109
That's not happiness
to see me, is it?

806
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:01,239
Try surprise.

807
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:09,519
The key to the dead man's
apartment was on my key chain.

808
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:12,511
Someone put it there
after I killed him.

809
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:16,150
Only one person in the world
could've done that.

810
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:18,269
Me.

811
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:20,234
Why?

812
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:21,874
To protect you.

813
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:23,439
From what?

814
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:26,994
Your lover.

815
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:32,276
Unless somebody else
sent these pictures.

816
01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:54,712
Amazing how you know people are in love,
even across the street.

817
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:57,316
He called me here two months ago...

818
01:19:57,560 --> 01:20:00,199
...bragged about how
you'd fallen for him.

819
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:02,870
I've shelled out over
$100,000 already...

820
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:04,479
...but he wants a lot more.

821
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:05,836
For what?

822
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:08,318
For breaking it off.

823
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:11,753
I don't believe you.

824
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:16,039
Did he mention Belize?

825
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:20,712
That's where he took
all the other ones.

826
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:26,155
This guy was quite an aphrodisiac
for lonely women of means.

827
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,560
He learned to paint in prison...

828
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:31,193
...not at Berkeley.

829
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:48,032
I don't know where we go from here.

830
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:51,238
I don't even know if "we"
is an option.

831
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:56,231
I have done everything in my power
to protect you from this...

832
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:59,995
...career criminal that you've let
crawl into our bed.

833
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:02,553
Why didn't you tell me?

834
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:05,998
I was sure you were in love with him.

835
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:08,439
Are you?

836
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:12,996
I thought that I was.

837
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:18,678
I can only imagine
what I've put you through.

838
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:26,798
Is this why your business
is in trouble?

839
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:28,789
Trouble?

840
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:31,192
The banks, margin calls.

841
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:36,311
How did you know...?
It hasn't helped, no.

842
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:40,199
-But it's true, isn't it?
-Yes, it's true.

843
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:42,351
But I can always make money.

844
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:44,875
There's a goddamn sea of it out there.

845
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:46,918
But there's only one of you.

846
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:51,637
But why did you put his key
on my key chain?

847
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:57,233
David threatened violence
from the very beginning.

848
01:21:57,560 --> 01:22:00,632
When I saw the body,
I was sure it was him.

849
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:04,677
No doors had been forced open,
so I assumed that he had your key.

850
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:07,076
But when? I'd used it
to come home that evening.

851
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:12,356
Are you sure you used your key?
If memory serves me...

852
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:16,076
...the door was wide open.
I saw you walk in.

853
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:17,389
Maybe.

854
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:20,758
In which case, he could've
taken your key anytime...

855
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:25,033
...even the day before.
Did you see him the day before?

856
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:26,595
Yes.

857
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:30,839
I searched his pockets,
I found what I thought was your key...

858
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:34,316
...I grabbed a screwdriver,
jimmied the door.

859
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:37,233
I put it in his pocket,
took what I thought was your key...

860
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:39,950
...and put it on your key chain.

861
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:45,191
Baby, I am so sorry
for having to put you through this.

862
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:47,910
It was the only thing I could do.

863
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:50,112
Can you ever forgive me?

864
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:52,790
Honey, I already have.

865
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:02,115
We have to go to the police.

866
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:07,790
I don't know if this is the time
for brutal honesty.

867
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:09,672
I've tampered with evidence...

868
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:11,239
...in a homicide.

869
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:14,153
I paid off a blackmail.
I'm in over my head and so are you.

870
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:18,313
Think it through!
David could say anything he wants.

871
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:20,551
He could say that
I hired him to kill you.

872
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:23,758
Or that he blackmailed us,
the happy, wealthy couple.

873
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,434
It'd appear we killed that poor
bastard, thinking it was David.

874
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:28,557
It depends on how he plays it.

875
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,279
What about the man that I killed?

876
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:33,273
That has to do with David?

877
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:34,919
Well, it must!

878
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:39,950
Do you have any idea how many
burglaries there are each day?

879
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:41,993
I don't think so.

880
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:47,873
What are we going to do now?

881
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:52,559
We'll have to disentangle ourselves
from your artist friend.

882
01:23:54,160 --> 01:23:56,913
Is there anything in his loft that
could link David to us?

883
01:23:59,320 --> 01:24:00,753
My ring.

884
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:02,678
You said it was being repaired.

885
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:06,269
That was a lie.
I left it by the bed.

886
01:24:09,240 --> 01:24:10,275
Anything else?

887
01:24:11,160 --> 01:24:13,071
Isn't that enough?

888
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:16,873
I'll get it.

889
01:24:33,560 --> 01:24:36,074
Will you be home when I get back?

890
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:38,153
Yes.

891
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:48,988
I'm on my way.

892
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:51,913
I'm calling for Mr. David Shaw.

893
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:53,673
Speaking.

894
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:58,072
It's Truman Travel, confirming
your reservation for this afternoon.

895
01:25:58,360 --> 01:25:59,588
Thank you.

896
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:20,069
Excuse me, sir.

897
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:21,958
Could you spare 400 grand?

898
01:26:22,240 --> 01:26:23,912
I don't see why not.

899
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:31,516
Don't think I won't count it.

900
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:33,039
Naturally.

901
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:38,194
Think of that
as your commemorative copy.

902
01:26:46,120 --> 01:26:48,509
Nice doing business with you, Steve.

903
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:54,434
You take care.

904
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:13,396
Last call: boarding
train number 32 for Montreal...

905
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:16,074
...departing on track number 16.
All aboard.

906
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:25,669
Right this way.

907
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:34,713
Here we are, sir.

908
01:28:38,120 --> 01:28:39,473
Thank you, sir.

909
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:24,079
Wanted to let you know
the dining car opens at 7.

910
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:25,873
Closes at 10 sharp.

911
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:35,271
Okay, everything's fine.

912
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:50,232
Attention, please.

913
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:55,310
Last call for train 32
departing to Montreal in 4 minutes.

914
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:09,949
How's that for wet work?

915
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:15,038
You should thank me.

916
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:18,710
Artists are always appreciated
more after they're dead.

917
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:28,028
You lose.

918
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:31,235
I'm sorry, you got to speak up.
I can't hear you.

919
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:33,389
You're dying.

920
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:41,630
Steven's...

921
01:30:41,960 --> 01:30:43,518
...greatest hits.

922
01:31:09,480 --> 01:31:11,516
Excuse me.
I got an emergency here.

923
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:12,590
What are you doing?

924
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:15,269
-This'll make it easier.
-Be my guest!

925
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:17,758
91st and Fifth.

926
01:31:26,160 --> 01:31:28,390
Has there been a delivery today?

927
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:32,479
Just one. It came by messenger,
Your wife took it up with the mail.

928
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:53,789
I didn't know you were here.

929
01:32:54,240 --> 01:32:55,958
I was out on the terrace.

930
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:10,918
Welcome home.

931
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:19,949
It's time for a new start.

932
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:25,435
What do you say we go out
for dinner this evening?

933
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:28,712
Just the two of us,
someplace quiet...

934
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:30,792
...in the neighborhood.

935
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:32,315
Like that?

936
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:36,754
I'll be right back.
I'm going to clean up.

937
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:13,390
Honey?

938
01:35:15,120 --> 01:35:18,590
Let's stay home tonight.
I'll go pick up something to eat.

939
01:35:21,200 --> 01:35:23,873
That's sweet of you.
Just don't be too long.

940
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:25,429
I won't.

941
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:31,515
Before I forget, I think
we should have the locks changed.

942
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:40,755
Why?

943
01:35:41,480 --> 01:35:43,789
Because I still can't find my key.

944
01:35:47,560 --> 01:35:50,916
Good idea. I'll call
the locksmith in the morning.

945
01:35:51,360 --> 01:35:53,316
Better be safe than sorry.

946
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:54,794
Thanks.

947
01:35:56,320 --> 01:35:58,276
See you soon. Hurry back.

948
01:36:34,120 --> 01:36:36,111
Must have put it back on his way in.

949
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:39,551
Didn't plan on that, did you?

950
01:36:47,120 --> 01:36:48,473
Young David...

951
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:51,078
...he was very unpredictable.

952
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:53,797
Maybe you'll share a cell.

953
01:36:55,200 --> 01:36:56,428
Why?

954
01:36:57,200 --> 01:36:58,599
Because of this?

955
01:37:00,920 --> 01:37:02,990
I just found the key you lost.

956
01:37:03,320 --> 01:37:04,958
You left it for him.

957
01:37:06,040 --> 01:37:07,234
You mean the man you killed.

958
01:37:07,480 --> 01:37:09,630
-I never met the gentleman.
-David did.

959
01:37:09,880 --> 01:37:12,189
They'll have a hard time
proving I knew David.

960
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:14,630
The blackmail proves it.

961
01:37:14,840 --> 01:37:15,875
What blackmail?

962
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:17,754
There's only one letter...

963
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,911
...and I'm afraid that's vanished.

964
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:24,228
The thing is, we're just
another married couple...

965
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:26,391
...trying to work things out.

966
01:37:27,320 --> 01:37:28,469
Work it out?

967
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:30,874
Work it out?

968
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:35,558
Because that's what she does
on nights that I play cards.

969
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:37,956
Like the combination to the safe?

970
01:37:38,240 --> 01:37:39,514
It's our wedding day, Steven.

971
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:44,555
You work it out on your fucking own!
This is over!

972
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:51,670
I'll tell you when it's over.

973
01:38:11,720 --> 01:38:14,154
The only way you leave me
is dead.

974
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:15,670
I always thought that "bludgeon"
had a spur-of-the-moment sound.

975
01:39:16,720 --> 01:39:19,234
Maybe you could use one of these.

976
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:23,989
Rifle the jewelry in the bedroom.

977
01:39:24,280 --> 01:39:27,670
Disable the service entrance lock.
Make it look like it was jimmied.

978
01:39:28,160 --> 01:39:29,718
Put the key back under the pipe...

979
01:39:29,960 --> 01:39:31,951
...then leave
the same way you came in.

980
01:39:33,160 --> 01:39:35,720
And what happens
if the plan goes to hell?

981
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:39,239
It won't.

982
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:51,238
He said he was going to kill me.

983
01:39:52,240 --> 01:39:54,037
So I tried to run.

984
01:39:55,040 --> 01:39:56,632
And then he attacked you?

985
01:39:59,480 --> 01:40:00,595
Yes.

986
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:05,352
What else could you do?

987
01:40:11,640 --> 01:40:14,473
May God be with you.

988
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:17,476
And you as well.
