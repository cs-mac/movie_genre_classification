VERY FAMOUS PEOPLE.

178
00:11:48,776 --> 00:11:49,810
...YOU SAY YOU KNOW THEM.

179
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:51,478
YES, BUT THEY
DON'T KNOW YOU, RIGHT?

180
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:55,115
YEAH. LISTEN.
WELL, YOU KNOW,
IT--IT JUST SO HAPPENS

181
00:11:55,182 --> 00:11:58,285
THAT HEXINA'S BODY
USED TO BE
MY OLD MAILING ADDRESS.

182
00:11:58,351 --> 00:11:59,486
BOOM. SHH.

183
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,089
HEY, LEVINE NEEDS US.

184
00:12:04,124 --> 00:12:05,959
YOU, TOO,
NEEDLE-DICK.

185
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:08,862
INCREDIBLE
AS IT MAY SEEM,

186
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:11,899
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
AN IMPORTANT GUEST
HERE TOMORROW.

HEXINA. ALL RIGHT, HEXINA.

190
00:12:18,638 --> 00:12:20,673
NOW, YOU PEOPLE
ARE THE ONLY ONES
I'M TELLING.

192
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:25,478
THE WOMAN WISHES TO KEEP
HER VISIT TO THIS COUNTRY
A SECRET.

193
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:26,679
...HERE!

194
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,549
THAT'S WHY
SHE PICKED THIS HOTEL.

195
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:32,019
NOBODY GIVES A SHIT
WHO STAYS HERE.

196
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:35,555
WHAT THE HELL IS GOIN' ON?

197
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:37,657
WHAT--WHAT ARE YOU,
THE KATZENJAMMER KIDS
OR SOMETHING? WHAT IS IT?

198
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:40,360
WELL, SIR, UM,
MATTHEW WAS JUST
TELLING ME THAT--

199
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,595
[laughing]
THAT HE USED TO
DATE HEXINA.

200

MATTHEW, COME ON.

203
00:12:55,976 --> 00:12:59,079
COME ON.
IT WAS SUCH A COINCIDENCE.

204
00:12:59,146 --> 00:13:02,682
I MEAN, WHY--WHY ARE YOU
FAILING TO SEE THE HUMOR
IN THIS?

205
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:04,818
WHY?

206
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:08,856
BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN
AT THIS HOTEL
FOR 12 YEARS, GLORIA.

207
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:10,157

BESIDES, IT'S NOT
A VERY GOOD FEELING
BEING TAKEN FOR GRANTED.

213
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:21,935
I KNOW.

214

00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:08,882
COMING IN, I REALIZED
THE LEFT ENGINE WAS OUT.

221
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:11,118
I TURNED TO MY--MY COPILOT
AND I SAID, "HANK..."

222
00:14:14,221 --> 00:14:16,756
(Matthew)
BUT I JUST SAID AGAIN,
AND AGAIN, AND AGAIN:

223
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:19,960
"IT IS NOT MY CLIENT
WHO IS ON TRIAL HERE.

224
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:23,997
IT IS THE LAW
THAT IS ON TRIAL
IN THIS CASE."

225
00:14:24,064 --> 00:14:25,899
WELL, THE--THE COURTROOM
WENT WILD.

00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,952
WHY THE FUCK
DID YOU DO SUCH A THING?

527
00:35:21,019 --> 00:35:26,425
WELL, SEE, I TOLD PEOPLE

528
00:35:26,492 --> 00:35:30,196
THAT WE'VE HAD
A RELATIONSHIP IN THE PAST,
THAT WE WERE INVOLVED.

529
00:35:31,897 --> 00:35:35,000
I'M--I'M A LITTLE BIT
OF A LIAR.

531
00:35:36,502 --> 00:35:38,103
YOU JUST ATTEMPTED MURDER.

532
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:41,173
NO, I WAS JUST TRYING
TO SCARE YOU. HIM.

533
00:35:42,941 --> 00:35:44,243
OH, GOD.

534
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:46,745
TAKE ME BACK
TO THE HOLIDAY PALACE.

535
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:52,818
FUCKING GEEK.

536
00:35:58,357 --> 00:36:01,427
FIGURES. I'M WALKIN' AROUND
WITH HER AND NOBODY SEES ME.

537
00:36:02,461 --> 00:36:03,962
AW, LIFE.

538
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,532
I DON'T WISH
TO BE DISTURBED.

539
00:36:06,598 --> 00:36:08,434
TOO LATE.
YOU ALREADY ARE.

540
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,669
ALL RIGHT, LADY.
YOU GOT ABOUT 5 SECONDS

541
00:36:10,736 --> 00:36:12,271
TO TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE,

542
00:36:12,338 --> 00:36:14,873
OR I'M GONNA HAVE
A LITTLE CHAT
WITH THE POLICE.

543
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:23,815
3 MONTHS AGO,
I RECEIVED THESE
IN THE MAIL.

544
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:28,153
OH, BOY.

545
00:36:31,357 --> 00:36:32,858
(Hexina)
THAT'S ME.

546
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:36,928
7 YEARS AGO.
BEFORE NUTRISYSTEM.

547
00:36:38,464 --> 00:36:40,632
WHERE WERE THESE TAKEN?

548
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:43,902
AT A HOSPITAL AROUND HERE
WHERE I WAS A PATIENT.

549
00:36:43,969 --> 00:36:45,937
(Matthew)
WHAT WERE YOU DOING
IN THE STATES?

550
00:36:46,004 --> 00:36:48,474
I'M AN AMERICAN CITIZEN.
BORN AND RAISED.

551
00:36:49,408 --> 00:36:52,043
MY REAL NAME IS HELEN SPEARS.

552
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,812
HELEN SPEARS?

553

[chuckles]

554
00:36:57,483 --> 00:37:00,986
AND I THOUGHT
I WAS THE ONLY ONE
PLAYING MASQUERADE GAMES.

555
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:03,622
SO, HOW'S HENRY PRATT
ENTER INTO THIS?

556
00:37:03,689 --> 00:37:06,492
HE SAYS HE'S A CLERK
AT THE PATIENT RECORDS.

557
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:08,827
HE RECENTLY CAME ACROSS
THOSE OLD PHOTOS.

558
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:10,429
WHAT'S HE
ASKING FOR?

559
00:37:11,297 --> 00:37:12,831
$400,000.

560

561
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,200
HMM.

562
00:37:15,267 --> 00:37:17,469
HE ALSO EXPECTS ME
TO FUCK HIM.

563
00:37:17,536 --> 00:37:19,705
THAT'S THE PART YOU GOT. HA!

564
00:37:19,771 --> 00:37:21,773
I KNOW. I WAS THERE.

565
00:37:23,008 --> 00:37:26,545
NONE OF WHAT YOU SAID
JUSTIFIES MURDER.

566
00:37:26,612 --> 00:37:30,616
LOOK, I-- HOW MANY TIMES
DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU,
I JUST--

567
00:37:30,682 --> 00:37:34,353
I--I JUST WANTED
TO SCARE THE GUY. OK?

568
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:37,423
SO HE WOULDN'T--WOULDN'T
RUIN MY IMAGE.

569
00:37:38,223 --> 00:37:39,658
[Hexina sobbing]

570
00:37:39,725 --> 00:37:43,362
ALL I'VE ACHIEVED
IS AT STAKE.

571
00:37:43,429 --> 00:37:45,731
I MEAN, LOOK AT ALL
THE GOOD STUFF I DO.

APOLOGIZE AND ASK

581
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:12,057
I'M SORRY.
UM, WOULD YOU LIKE

582
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,125

DON'T BE LATE.

585

WHAT AM I GONNA DO?
I DIDN'T EXPECT TO PAY.

586
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,002
WELL, LOOK. WE'LL DRIVE
OVER THERE TOGETHER,

OH, LIKE ADULTS?
THE GUY'S A BLACKMAILER.

LISTEN, FOR BETTER
OR FOR WORSE,

A PIECE OF YOUR LUGGAGE
JUST ARRIVED, MA'AM.

[thudding]

597
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:45,357
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO HURRY.

598

LET ME JUST TAKE SOMETHING
TO CALM MY NERVES.

599

OK, BUT, YOU KNOW,
WE GOTTA-- WE GOTTA HURRY

YOU OK IN THERE?

601
00:38:52,464 --> 00:38:54,299
YOU KNOW, UM,
IF IT'S ONE OF THOSE
TWIST-OFF THINGS,

602
00:38:54,366 --> 00:38:56,568
I MIGHT BE ABLE
TO GIVE YOU A HAND.
I'M VERY GOOD WITH THOSE.

603
00:38:56,635 --> 00:38:58,670
MY, UH, MY--MY DAD I-INVENTED
THEM, ACTUALLY.

604
00:38:58,737 --> 00:39:00,506
COME ON.
WE'VE REALLY GOTTA GO.

605
00:39:00,572 --> 00:39:01,873

FUCK!
WHAT--WHAT--WHAT?

607
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:04,643
I LEFT MY EARRINGS
IN YOUR APARTMENT.

THEY'RE FINE. DON'T WORRY--

609
00:39:06,111 --> 00:39:08,113
THEY WERE DESIGNED
FOR ME BY LENEAU.
THAT'S OK.

610
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,314
BUT THEY'RE WORTH
A FORTUNE.

611
00:39:09,381 --> 00:39:10,516
OK, WE'LL GET 'EM LATER.

612

JUST LET ME
DO ALL THE TALKING.

I HAPPEN TO BE VERY GOOD
IN SITUATIONS LIKE THESE.

[crickets chirping]

615
00:39:17,723 --> 00:39:21,560
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
TO BE NON-CONFRONTATIONAL.

*[music playing on radio]

617

HEY, HEY.

629
00:40:32,464 --> 00:40:34,500
I GOT THE KEYS.

630
00:40:34,566 --> 00:40:37,302

JUST GONNA SCARE HIM.

I LIED. BUT YOU GOTTA ADMIT,
I WAS NON-CONFRONTATIONAL.

635
00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:54,052
NOW HELP ME LOOK
FOR THE NEGATIVES.

636
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:56,655

BY SEARCHING
THAT TRASH HEAP.

MATTHEW, DO NOT
RAISE YOUR VOICE.

643
00:41:25,116 --> 00:41:28,486
I'M FEELING VERY FRAGILE
AT THE MOMENT, OK?

644
00:41:28,554 --> 00:41:30,288
BESIDES, THEY DIDN'T
INSTITUTIONALIZE ME

645
00:41:30,355 --> 00:41:33,391
JUST FOR HAVING A YEN
FOR CHEESECAKE, YOU KNOW.

646
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:37,663
TELL ME
WHY THEY DID.

647
00:41:40,532 --> 00:41:44,102
WHEN I WAS 16,
I WAS SEDUCED
BY AN OLDER MAN.

648
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:45,937
HE WAS CRUEL
AND SADISTIC.

649
00:41:47,172 --> 00:41:48,607
WHAT DID HE DO?

650
00:41:48,674 --> 00:41:49,975
HE SOLD INSURANCE.

651
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:51,910
NO. NO. NO.

652
00:41:51,977 --> 00:41:54,012
TELL ME WHAT HE DID TO YOU.

653
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:58,617
I WAS EMOTIONALLY
AND SEXUALLY ABUSED.

654
00:41:58,684 --> 00:42:01,052
AND THEN, ONE DAY,
HE JUST WENT TOO FAR.

655
00:42:02,153 --> 00:42:03,454
WHAT HAPPENED?

656
00:42:04,222 --> 00:42:06,291
HE REFUSED TO MARRY ME.

657

869
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,834
SORRY TO BOTHER YOU.

870

873
00:54:06,444 --> 00:54:09,514
WE WERE WONDERING
IF YOU COULD LET US
INTO MR. WELSH'S APARTMENT?

874
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:12,717
WE'RE TRYING
TO RETRIEVE SOMETHING
OF A PERSONAL NATURE.

875
00:54:13,784 --> 00:54:16,654

WHAT IS THAT?

889
00:55:31,696 --> 00:55:34,331
I WAS JUST ABOUT
TO ASK YOU
THE SAME QUESTION.

890
00:55:35,132 --> 00:55:37,468
I MEAN,

891
00:55:37,535 --> 00:55:40,805
COULD WELSH,
FOR ONCE IN HIS LIFE,
BEEN TELLING THE TRUTH?

893
00:55:49,113 --> 00:55:51,582
WE'LL GET TO THAT

894

RIGHT NOW, SIMON WANTS
AN EXPLANATION.

SIMON.

896
00:55:59,123 --> 00:56:01,992
IT'S ACTUALLY VERY,
VERY SIMPLE.

897
00:56:07,632 --> 00:56:10,300

IS JUST SO SILLY.

WELL, YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT
I SAW THE HOTEL SEDAN
BEING TOWED BACK.

1043

HE'S AVOIDING ME.
YOU KNOW WHY?

NO.

1045
01:05:17,514 --> 01:05:20,784
BECAUSE HE KNOWS THAT
WHENEVER I RUN INTO HIM,
I'M GONNA KILL HIM.

1046
01:05:25,089 --> 01:05:26,090
NO.

PATRIOTISM TOOK
A BIZARRE TURN TONIGHT

1062
01:06:35,159 --> 01:06:38,928
WHEN A LOCAL HOTEL EMPLOYEE
WRAPPED HIMSELF

1074
01:07:28,145 --> 01:07:31,748
UM, SIMON SAID SOMETHING
ONCE ABOUT, UH,

1075
01:07:31,815 --> 01:07:33,283
THROWING HIMSELF
OFF A ROOF,

JUST FONDLY REFER TO ME
AS "PAPPY" FERGUSON.

OH, WHAT THE HELL.

1204
01:14:09,412 --> 01:14:10,880
FANTASTIC.

1205
01:14:10,947 --> 01:14:13,082
ANYTHING ELSE, MASTER?

1206
01:14:13,149 --> 01:14:15,552
HOW ABOUT A SH-SHOWER?

1207
01:14:15,619 --> 01:14:17,153

GRANDPA, COME ON.

THEY'VE APPARENTLY FOUND

1215
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:36,973
WHAT THEY BELIEVE
IS THE MURDER WEAPON DURING
A SWEEP OF WELSH'S APARTMENT.

1216
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:38,374
OH.

1218
01:14:40,143 --> 01:14:43,446
UM, EXCUSE ME, UH,

01:14:43,513 --> 01:14:46,282

GOD! GLORIA.

1221
01:14:51,054 --> 01:14:52,922
SHH, MATTHEW.

YOU MIND IF I USE THIS?

1225
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:03,432
OH, WELL, ACTUALLY--

1226
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:05,234
I'VE BEEN DRINKING
HERBAL TEA ALL MORNING--

1227
01:15:05,301 --> 01:15:07,871
OH, IT DOESN'T FLUSH.
IT'S--IT'S OVERFLOWING.
IT DOESN'T FLUSH.

1228
01:15:07,937 --> 01:15:09,539

1229
01:15:09,606 --> 01:15:11,007

MATTHEW.

1236
01:15:23,953 --> 01:15:26,856
MATTHEW, YOU GOTTA
GET OUT OF HERE.

1237
01:15:26,923 --> 01:15:28,992
THEY SAY THAT THEY FOUND A GUN
IN YOUR APARTMENT.

1238
01:15:29,058 --> 01:15:30,560
A GUN?
YEAH.

1239
01:15:33,797 --> 01:15:36,766
WE USE THIS TRICK
ON CRACK DEALERS.

1240
01:15:36,833 --> 01:15:39,202
YOU SHOULDN'T LEAVE
YOUR WALLET OUT, MISTER.

1241
01:15:39,268 --> 01:15:40,970
I'LL REMEMBER
NEXT TIME.

01:15:41,805 --> 01:15:43,039
WHOA!

1243
01:15:43,106 --> 01:15:45,441

01:15:51,581 --> 01:15:52,982
DON'T KILL ME!

1247
01:15:56,319 --> 01:15:57,754
OH, FUCK!

1248
01:15:57,821 --> 01:15:59,355

HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

1250
01:16:00,790 --> 01:16:02,125
WHERE IS IT?

1251
01:16:03,860 --> 01:16:05,528
WHERE IS IT?
OH, I FOUND IT.
I FOUND IT.

01:16:08,164 --> 01:16:10,166
(woman)
PROSTITUTION'S ILLEGAL HERE,
TOO?

1254
01:16:10,233 --> 01:16:12,969
YOU WERE HARBORING
A KNOWN CRIMINAL.

1255
01:16:13,036 --> 01:16:16,205
AND I'M TELLING YOU
THAT MATTHEW
IS NOT A MURDERER.

1256
01:16:16,272 --> 01:16:18,407
OSCAR WILDE SAID IT BEST:

1257
01:16:18,474 --> 01:16:20,644
"SOCIETY OFTEN
FORGIVES THE CRIMINAL.

1258
01:16:20,710 --> 01:16:23,146
IT NEVER FORGIVES
THE DREAMER."

1259
01:16:23,212 --> 01:16:25,649
I BURNED BETTER BOOKS
THAN THAT ON SUNDAYS,

1260
01:16:25,715 --> 01:16:27,383
YOU FILTHY HIPPIE.

1261
01:16:29,185 --> 01:16:30,987
SCRATCH THAT
"HIPPIE" THING.

1262
01:16:31,054 --> 01:16:32,689
[door opening]

1263
01:16:32,756 --> 01:16:35,792
DETECTIVE, THE D.A.'S OFFICE
IS RETURNING YOUR PHONE CALL.

1264
01:16:35,859 --> 01:16:38,561
I AM NOT

IS THAT CLEAR?

1265
01:16:38,628 --> 01:16:39,929
GOD DAMN IT!

1266
01:16:39,996 --> 01:16:41,597
[door closing]

1267
01:16:41,665 --> 01:16:44,734
NOW, YOU CAN COUNT
ON BEIN' IN THIS ROOM
ALL NIGHT, LITTLE LADY.

1268
01:16:44,801 --> 01:16:47,036
I'M DIVORCED,
WITH NO CHARISMA.

1269
01:16:47,103 --> 01:16:49,005
I'VE GOT NOWHERE TO GO.

(desk clerk)
FRONT DESK, MA'AM.

1274
01:17:01,818 --> 01:17:04,821
YOU'RE CONFIRMED FOR TONIGHT'S
10:30 FLIGHT TO PARIS.

1275
01:17:04,888 --> 01:17:06,422
EXCELLENT.

1276
01:17:06,489 --> 01:17:09,659
BY THE WAY, I RESENT
THE CHEAP ARTWORK IN MY ROOM.

1277
01:17:17,333 --> 01:17:20,303
HEY, LOOK, I KNOW FOR A FACT
HEXINA'S STAYIN' THERE.

1278
01:17:20,369 --> 01:17:22,171
JUST PUT ME THROUGH TO HER.

AH, YES. HELLO, UH,
THIS IS AN EMERGENCY.

1281
01:17:29,913 --> 01:17:32,749
I NEED TO PAGE SOMEONE
IN THE HOTEL.

HELLO?

1288
01:17:49,265 --> 01:17:50,666
WHO IS THIS?

1289
01:17:50,734 --> 01:17:53,336
(Matthew)
THIS IS A FRIEND
OF HENRY PRATT

1290
01:17:53,402 --> 01:17:55,404
WHO'S BEEN FOLLOWING YOU.

1291
01:17:55,471 --> 01:17:58,107
I AM ACROSS THE STREET.

1292
01:17:58,174 --> 01:18:00,944
BE ON THE ROOF OF MY HOTEL
IN 5 MINUTES.

1293

[shouting]
HOW MANY FUCKING MEN
DO I HAVE TO KILL

1294
01:18:06,115 --> 01:18:07,784
IN THIS FUCKING TOWN?

1295

OPERATOR, CONNECT ME
TO THE NEAREST
POLICE PRECINCT.

01:18:11,554 --> 01:18:12,956
YEAH, METRO DIVISION.

1298
01:18:13,022 --> 01:18:16,059
(Matthew)
THIS IS MATTHEW WELSH.

1299
01:18:16,125 --> 01:18:18,527
MY HOROSCOPE SAYS
THAT TONIGHT

1300
01:18:18,594 --> 01:18:21,097
IS A GOOD NIGHT
TO MAKE NEW FRIENDS

1301
01:18:21,164 --> 01:18:23,599
AND THEN DISMEMBER THEM.

1302
01:18:23,666 --> 01:18:26,602
I'LL BE ON THE ROOF
OF THE PALM COURT

1303
01:18:26,669 --> 01:18:29,105
IF YOU WISH TO TRY
AND STOP ME.

1304
01:18:29,773 --> 01:18:31,140
[snickering]

1305
01:18:36,012 --> 01:18:38,214
HEY, NOVAK.

1306
01:18:38,281 --> 01:18:41,084
RUN IN AND GIVE THIS
TO FERGUSON.
IT SOUNDS LIKE A CRANK.

1307
01:18:41,150 --> 01:18:43,787
NO WAY. HE JUST CHEWED
MY ASS OUT ROYAL.

1308
01:18:44,921 --> 01:18:47,123
I'LL WAIT
UNTIL HE TAKES A BREAK.

1309
01:18:48,858 --> 01:18:50,093
I WANT A ROOM.

1310
01:19:06,209 --> 01:19:07,510
HELEN SPEARS!

1311
01:19:10,613 --> 01:19:11,781
IS THAT YOU?

1312
01:19:12,615 --> 01:19:14,650
HAVEN'T YOU LEARNED?

1313
01:19:14,717 --> 01:19:17,821
PLAYING GAMES WITH ME
CAN BE FATAL.

1314
01:19:20,689 --> 01:19:23,726
WELL, FOR THIS REMATCH,
I HAVE A DISTINCT ADVANTAGE.

1315
01:19:25,962 --> 01:19:29,365
EVIDENCE
THAT YOU'VE LIVED
A PAST LIFE

1316
01:19:29,432 --> 01:19:32,168
AS A CRAZED ZEPPELIN.

1317
01:19:32,235 --> 01:19:36,072
BY THE WAY, YOU NEVER DID
TELL ME EXACTLY WHY
YOU KILLED SIMON.

1318
01:19:36,139 --> 01:19:40,309
WHEN YOU'VE KILLED
AS MANY PEOPLE AS I HAVE,
IT'S EASY TO LOSE TRACK.

1319
01:19:40,376 --> 01:19:43,346
NOW, WHICH ONE WAS SIMON?
TALL GUY? BAD SKIN?

1320
01:19:43,412 --> 01:19:45,181
MATTHEW TOLD ME

1321
01:19:45,248 --> 01:19:47,450
THAT THE MODEL
DID THE KILLING.

1322
01:19:48,617 --> 01:19:50,519
AND I BELIEVE HIM.

1323
01:19:50,586 --> 01:19:54,057
HE THINKS SHE'S STAYING
AT THE PALM COURT HOTEL.

1324
01:19:54,123 --> 01:19:58,627
I BELIEVE YOU'VE MADE
A TWISTED LOVE PACT
WITH THAT CLOWN

1325
01:19:58,694 --> 01:20:02,165
BASED ON YOUR MUTUAL
ADMIRATION OF SATAN.

1326
01:20:02,765 --> 01:20:03,933
[sighs]

1327
01:20:05,168 --> 01:20:07,103
YOU ALWAYS HEAR
ABOUT CELEBRITIES

1328
01:20:07,170 --> 01:20:09,672
GETTING AWAY
WITH MURDER.

1329
01:20:09,738 --> 01:20:12,441
BUT WHO WOULD THINK,
LITERALLY?

1330
01:20:12,508 --> 01:20:15,711
WHY DOES IT SEEM LIKE YOU'RE
STALLING FOR TIME?

1331
01:20:15,778 --> 01:20:17,280
[siren wailing]

1332
01:20:17,346 --> 01:20:18,714
HERE YOU GO.

1333
01:20:20,783 --> 01:20:23,552
YOU KNOW, WHEN IT COMES
TO DUPLICITY,

1334
01:20:23,619 --> 01:20:26,055
YOU ARE A RANK AMATEUR.

1335
01:20:26,122 --> 01:20:27,756
WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT?

1336
01:20:27,823 --> 01:20:30,426
I CALLED THE COPS.

1337
01:20:30,493 --> 01:20:34,063
THEY'LL TAKE US BOTH
INTO CUSTODY
AND HEAR A FULL CONFESSION.

1338
01:20:34,130 --> 01:20:36,132
[siren continues wailing]

1339
01:20:36,199 --> 01:20:38,101
YOURS.

1340
01:20:38,167 --> 01:20:40,203
(Hexina)
WHEN YOU'VE KILLED
AS MANY PEOPLE AS I HAVE,

1341
01:20:40,269 --> 01:20:42,271
IT'S EASY TO LOSE TRACK.

1342
01:20:44,941 --> 01:20:46,642
YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME.

1343
01:20:48,177 --> 01:20:52,515
NO. BECAUSE YOU'RE NOTHIN'
BUT A FRONT-DESK CLERK!

1344
01:20:52,581 --> 01:20:55,818
SIR, THE WATCH COMMANDER
THOUGHT YOU SHOULD SEE THIS.

1345
01:20:56,452 --> 01:20:58,554
THE PALM COURT.

1346
01:20:58,621 --> 01:21:00,156
HAS A UNIT
BEEN DISPATCHED?

1347
01:21:00,223 --> 01:21:02,158
YOU SAID
NOT TO MAKE A MOVE
UNTIL YOU--

1348
01:21:02,225 --> 01:21:05,461
THIS IS NOT
THE PEACE CORPS HERE,
YOU IDIOTS!

1349
01:21:05,528 --> 01:21:08,197
MOBILIZE SOME BACKUP! NOW!

1350
01:21:08,264 --> 01:21:10,233
[sirens continue wailing]

1351
01:21:11,467 --> 01:21:12,435
GUESS WHAT?

1352
01:21:12,501 --> 01:21:14,037
[chuckling]

1353
01:21:14,103 --> 01:21:16,672
THAT WASN'T
A POLICE CAR.

1354
01:21:16,739 --> 01:21:19,242
LOOKS MORE
LIKE A SMALL AMBULANCE,
YOU DORK.

1355
01:21:19,308 --> 01:21:20,543
[laughing]

1356
01:21:21,310 --> 01:21:22,311
HUH.

1357
01:21:23,312 --> 01:21:25,214
WHO THE FUCK
IS THIS NOBODY?

1358
01:21:25,281 --> 01:21:27,550
SOME MIDDLE-CLASS
DOUCHE BAG YOU DATE?

1359
01:21:27,616 --> 01:21:29,252
SHE LOOKS LIKE A PYGMY.

1360
01:21:31,554 --> 01:21:33,489
YOU DON'T THREATEN ME.

1361
01:21:33,556 --> 01:21:35,058
I HAPPEN TO KNOW
FOR A FACT

1362
01:21:35,124 --> 01:21:37,994
THAT YOU LEFT YOUR GUN
IN MY APARTMENT.

1363
01:21:38,061 --> 01:21:39,195
TRUE.

1364
01:21:39,929 --> 01:21:41,497
BUT I KEPT
YOUR KNIFE.

1365
01:21:41,564 --> 01:21:42,831
[grunting]

1366
01:21:42,898 --> 01:21:44,968
FAGGOT HOLIDAY FUCKIN' PALACE!

1367
01:21:45,034 --> 01:21:47,303
LET ME SEE YOUR EYES
WHILE I KILL YOU!

1368
01:21:47,370 --> 01:21:48,837
[laughing]

1369
01:21:48,904 --> 01:21:50,906
(Matthew)
FORGET IT.

1370
01:21:55,278 --> 01:21:56,645
[screaming]

1371
01:21:57,713 --> 01:21:59,915
OH, SHIT.
