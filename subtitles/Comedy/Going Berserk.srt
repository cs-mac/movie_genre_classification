1
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,689
I know, I know,
we're almost there.

2
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,847
All right, all right, okay, let's...
Oh, cut that out!

3
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,887
Will you stop that?
Will you knock that off?

4
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:44,651
Come on, a joke is a joke.
Will you cut it out?

5
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,921
All right,
smoke 'em if you got 'em.

6
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:50,419
All right, lighten up
and listen to me now.

7
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:53,465
Hi. I guess you're wondering
how I got here.

8
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,428
Well, let me
first introduce myself.

9
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:58,231
My name is John Bourgignon,
of the Melonville Bourgignons.

10
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:00,101
And a good friend of mine
Chick Leff and I

11
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:02,198
ran a limousine service
back in the States.

12
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:04,903
You see, I was about
to get married to this girl
Nancy Reese.

13
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:07,344
Well, see for yourself.
You're not gonna believe
this story.

14
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,744
You're really not
gonna believe it.

15
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:09,873
You might believe it,
I don't know.

16
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:12,474
You might buy it,
you might not. Check it out.

17
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,721
I'm just gonna stop off
at Sal's for a second.

18
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:21,555
No, I don't wanna go there.

19
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:24,620
He's gonna talk us
into acting in another one
of his kung fu movies again.

20
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:26,961
That was embarrassing.
What do you
think he wants?

21
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:29,695
Look, the only time he ever
talks to me is when we're
late on limo payments,

22
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,168
and we're not late, so...

23
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:33,034
How does he make any money
on a look-alike service?

24
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,700
He don't.
We're here to see
Mr. Di Pasquale.

25
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,107
I think his mother
is on the phone.
May I say who's calling?

26
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:40,270
Tell him John
and Chick are here.
I'll see if he's free.

27
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:41,370
Thank you.

28
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:47,252
Fuck you!
Yeah, well, fuck you!

29
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:50,112
He's on a conference call.

30
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:52,350
If you'd care to take a seat,
he'll be with you momentarily.

31
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:54,256
Great. Thanks a lot.
Thank you.

32
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:08,169
Hey, Chick, Johnny, come on.
I've been waiting for you.

33
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:09,936
Come on inside.
I didn't know you guys
were here.

34
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:10,998
Chick, how you doing?

35
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:13,170
<i>Here comes the bride,
here comes the bride</i>

36
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:14,577
I got an important
meeting inside.

37
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,274
No phone calls,
no interruptions.

38
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:19,614
I don't wanna be disturbed.
What if you get a phone call?

39
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:23,112
No phone calls!
I got an important
meeting inside.

40
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:25,054
No interruptions,
no nothing!

41
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:28,719
Yes, Mr. Dispas...
Pasquale!
Di Pasquale, Di Pasquale!

42
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,090
Make yourself at home.

43
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:36,298
Is this a real Oscar, Sal?

44
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:39,497
You bet your fat ass it is,
Johnny. It's the real thing.

45
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,766
<i>Best Foreign Film, 1958.
My Big Hill.</i>

46
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,137
Somebody gave me that.

47
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:47,976
One of these days
I'm gonna have my own.

48
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:51,210
I've been thinking about
getting back into movies,
you know?

49
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:53,184
Yeah. Sit down.
Thanks, Sal.

50
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:57,120
So, so, so,
a lot's been happening
since I seen you last.

51
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,549
Been reading about you
in the paper and everything.

52
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:02,355
I mean, you're marrying
Ed Reese's daughter,
that's a very big thing.

53
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:04,988
I guess so, yeah.
So, how'd you swing that?

54
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:08,395
Well, we met
and we liked each other.

55
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:10,333
We fell in love
and we're gonna
get married.

56
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:12,234
That's very warm.
I mean, I like the sound.

57
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:14,273
The love thing
is very important,
because you know,

58
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:18,174
my own marriage didn't
work out too good, but I don't
wanna get into that now.

59
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:20,906
Sal, show him the picture.
He don't wanna
see the picture.

60
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,039
Come on, show him the picture.
He don't wanna see.

61
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,414
So I carry a picture
of the ex on me.

62
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:27,885
You know,
just for old times' sake.
I'd like to see it.

63
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:30,616
She was a sweet kid.
She was 18 when I married her.

64
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,215
Where'd you meet her,
in high school?
No. I wish
I went to high school.

65
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:35,692
Take a look at this.

66
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:37,720
Nice.
Took a good picture, huh?

67
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:39,025
Yeah.
Yeah.

68
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:40,994
Well...

69
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:44,259
The whole thing
turned to rat shit
just after the honeymoon.

70
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:46,202
Well, look, Sal,
why'd you call us here?

71
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:48,103
You know,
wouldn't it be interesting

72
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:52,474
if you talked Ed Reese
into letting me film
the entire wedding?

73
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:55,070
No, I'm sorry.
No, it just wouldn't work.

74
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,913
You don't think
I'm good enough?
I didn't say that.

75
00:06:57,984 --> 00:07:01,010
<i>Maybe you didn't see
a little film I like
to call Kung Fu U!</i>

76
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,076
What?

77
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:05,758
Maybe you don't remember
a little Salvatore
Di Pasquale production,

78
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:09,989
which just happened
to gross $410,000
across this entire country

79
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:11,552
including drive-ins.

80
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:14,295
I guess you don't
remember that, huh?

81
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:16,392
And I put you
in the damn movie!

82
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,961
Sorry, Johnny, I got a bark
that's worse than my bite.

83
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,237
I gotta do something
about this temper.
I'm sorry, I didn't know that.

84
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,778
Oh, no, that's all right.
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.

85
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:30,373
I just think it's...
He just won't go along
with it, that's all.

86
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:32,910
Hey, you wanna know
what I think?

87
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:35,210
I think it would be good
for his image.

88
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:38,257
I really feel it'd be wrong.
I mean, he doesn't like me.

89
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:41,555
Telephone, Mr. Dispasques...
Moron!

90
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:43,290
Moron!

91
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:48,025
Hey, let me ask
you boys something.

92
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:53,763
How much money do you
still owe on the limo? Just...

93
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:57,870
I don't know. About,
a little over $10,000,
I think.

94
00:07:57,944 --> 00:07:59,639
$12,300.
It's a lot of money.

95
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:02,272
That's a lot of fares.
That's a lot of work.

96
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:04,844
You know, I'd be willing
to kiss that money off

97
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:07,181
if you could swing
a deal with Reese.

98
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:11,517
Oh, no. No, no, no, no...
Well, it's real important
to me, Johnny.

99
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:13,422
You do this, do this for me,
I do this for you.

100
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,723
Scratch my back,
I'm scratching yours.
Well, Sal, it's impossible.

101
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:17,558
Thanks very much.
Well, just think about it,
that's all.

102
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,688
We gotta go to work.

103
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:21,665
Johnny,
that's a lot of money.

104
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:24,464
I know it is,
and I'm thinking about it.
Good.

105
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:27,835
All right, I'll tell you
what I'll do. I'll ask Nancy
to ask the old man,

106
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:30,705
but I'm not
promising anything.
Great. That's all I ask.

107
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:33,370
Now, do me a favor, would you?
I'm not covering
for you tonight.

108
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:35,209
I'm sorry. No,
I cannot work late.

109
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:37,249
Now, we've got that
big brunch tomorrow
at Nancy's folks',

110
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:39,079
and I wanna be perky
and charming.

111
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:41,210
Easy fare.
They're classical musicians.

112
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:43,619
You just take them
to their hotel.
It'll only take a minute.

113
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,179
No! No is no.

114
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:54,995
<i>We are live
outside the courthouse
where religious cult leader</i>

115
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:58,002
Sun Yi Day has just been
indicted on several counts.

116
00:08:58,137 --> 00:09:00,605
Included are conspiracy,
tax evasion,

117
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:03,403
kidnapping, resisting arrest
and jury tampering.

118
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,310
Congressman Ed Reese,
the presidential hopeful

119
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,370
who's leading the crusade
against these people,

120
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:10,813
will be joining us shortly.
Hi, Shirley.

121
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,214
Congressman.

122
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:15,613
Shirley, what everyone
must understand about this

123
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:18,486
is that it is not
religious persecution.

124
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:22,691
The Church of Sun Yi
is not a church at all.
It's a front.

125
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:26,960
It's a, it's a tax shelter
set up solely for personal
financial gain.

126
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:29,331
Well, how do you see
this situation now?
Shirley, there are so...

127
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,802
Excuse me. Reverend Sun Yi,
could we get a statement?

128
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:33,771
The Reverend Sun Yi
has no statements
at this time.

129
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,774
I'd like to say that
this is a very old story.

130
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:40,001
If you don't understand
something then you attack it.

131
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:43,708
You call it weird or a cult
and you try to destroy it.

132
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:45,683
While the person
who is leading the attack

133
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:49,152
is usually someone
who is on very shaky
moral ground himself.

134
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:54,219
He's unsure of himself and so
he lashes out in a paranoid
way against those of us

135
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:58,627
who've ascended
to a higher plane of
consciousness and awareness.

136
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:01,961
Well, we'll survive this.
We always have in the past.

137
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:05,429
And when Mr. Reese
loses his anger and his fear

138
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:09,907
we invite him to join us
in spreading our message
of love and profit.

139
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:11,466
Thank you very much.

140
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:16,274
Shirley, this is pure crap.

141
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:20,345
Can we quote you, Congressman?
Shirley, you may quote this.

142
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:22,250
I am going to get him.

143
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:27,455
Spanish version
of the Beatles. Wonderful.

144
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:37,668
<i>Los Beatles.
Ringo.</i>

145
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:39,329
Really?

146
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:40,770
Pablo.
How you doing?

147
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,171
Hi.
Hi.

148
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:43,708
Juan.
Juan.

149
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:46,004
How are you?
Jorge.

150
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:47,204
Jorge.

151
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,942
And I'm Mick Jagger!

152
00:10:57,523 --> 00:10:58,512
No.

153
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,162
Not while I'm driving, thanks.

154
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:19,004
Oh, thank you very much.

155
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,329
Oh, thank you, God!

156
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:41,263
Oh, thank you, God!
I owe you!

157
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:45,795
You made it.
A whole hour to sleep.

158
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,174
That's all I need.
Just need an hour.

159
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:08,725
I'm sorry.

160
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:12,161
You're fat.

161
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,929
My husband was fat.

162
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:18,633
He's dead now.

163
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:26,134
You must eat like a pig.

164
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:31,481
Pig.

165
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:37,321
Yeah. Yeah.

166
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,556
Cigarettes will kill you.

167
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,889
My husband smoked,
you know.

168
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:48,160
He died from smoking too much.

169
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:51,763
I thought you said he died
'cause he was fat.

170
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:55,633
He was fat with bad lungs!

171
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:58,875
Granny? Granny!

172
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:04,145
It's so good to see you.
My little girl.

173
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:09,651
I see you've met John.
No, I don't believe I have.

174
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:13,419
Oh, Granny,
this is my fiancé,
John Bourgignon.

175
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,023
Oh!
How do you do?

176
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:20,097
Oh, what a handsome young man.

177
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,269
I hope you will both
be as happy

178
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:27,034
as your grandfather
and I were.

179
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:43,518
John!

180
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:46,691
Are you okay?

181
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:49,557
I'm sorry.
I'm very sorry, Mrs. Reese.
I'm very sorry.

182
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:50,822
That's all right.

183
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:53,660
He's been
real tired recently.

184
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:56,926
He's been working so hard.
He's just exhausted.

185
00:13:57,469 --> 00:13:58,493
Where's Dad?

186
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:00,698
He's still on the phone
talking to Washington.

187
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:03,970
You know how it is
in Washington.
Yeah.

188
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:06,210
I'm sorry I'm late,
everyone.

189
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:10,009
I always say you can
call me anything but don't
call me late for dinner.

190
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:17,477
Yeah.

191
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:21,424
Mother, it's good to see you.
You look as wonderful as ever.

192
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:25,361
Hi, honey. Hello, baby.
Hello, Daddy.

193
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:27,930
Hello, Mr. Reese.
Yeah.

194
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:33,035
Daddy, John and Chick's
business is really
improving now.

195
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:36,539
Do you think that's gonna
make you enough money
to support my daughter,

196
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:38,076
driving a limousine?

197
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:42,043
Yes, sir, I do.
Yes, sir, that, and I also
supplement my income

198
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:43,877
by drumming part time.

199
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:46,541
As a matter of fact,
I'll be performing tonight.

200
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:49,019
Wonderful.
You hang out in nightclubs?

201
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:53,081
No, sir, it's not
really a nightclub.
How much money
do you make a year?

202
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:55,753
Wouldn't you rather talk
about this in private, sir?
No!

203
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:57,819
I'll get it.

204
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,330
Who could be
at the back door?

205
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:02,959
That'd be probably
my best man Chick
and his date.

206
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:04,662
I invited him, Daddy.

207
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:08,173
As I was saying,
how much money
do you make in a year?

208
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:09,967
Oh...

209
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:14,645
In a year? I would say
anywhere from 30 to...

210
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,143
$11,000 a year, sir.

211
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:19,476
But I invest
very heavily in stocks.
Stocks?

212
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,246
Oh, yes.
Who's your investor?

213
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:25,016
It's...
You wouldn't know them.

214
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:29,758
Really? What's that name?
No, I know a lot
of small firms.

215
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:32,854
Oh, they're just,
they're new almost,

216
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:36,025
and they go by the name of,

217
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:41,730
of Smith and Barney
and Andy and Dopey.

218
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,677
I'm very sorry.
You clumsy ox!

219
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:49,610
Daddy, please!
Do you see what you did?

220
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:51,240
He didn't mean
to break the chair.

221
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:52,944
He's too fat.

222
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:54,212
I'm sorry.

223
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:59,291
I'm very sorry about
the chair, sir. A little Krazy
Glue will fix that right up.

224
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:01,952
I'll just sit here if it's...
Here's my friend
Chick Leff now

225
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,689
and his date.
Hi, everybody.
Thanks for the invite.

226
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:07,129
Johnny, this is Misty.

227
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,827
Hi.
Oh, soup.

228
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,670
Pretty fancy place here, huh?
Yes, it looks great.

229
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:18,708
You have a half hour left.
It's up to you if you
wanna get off or not.

230
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:19,901
Oh!

231
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,241
Cool it!

232
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:24,205
You know how ridiculous
you people look?

233
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:28,515
Hello, darling.
Patti's here now.

234
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:29,884
I hate you people.

235
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:32,219
I hate all of you.
She doesn't mean this.

236
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,225
But your day
of reckoning will come!

237
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:37,160
And when it does,
I hope you get
what you deserve!

238
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:43,067
That's my daughter Patti.
She's the youngest.

239
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,596
Probably just a phase
she's going through.

240
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,503
If you like, I'll talk to her.
You know, I'm more her age.

241
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:51,805
Oh, Jesus, I need a drink.
I gotta make a martini.

242
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:54,339
He's been under
a lot of strain lately.

243
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:55,710
That's all right,
Mrs. Reese.

244
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:58,944
Stress has been known
to turn people
into complete shitheads.

245
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:01,309
Not your husband
per se, but...

246
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:04,254
I'll get it.

247
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,852
Well, maybe the wedding
will help to

248
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:09,951
bring everybody
closer together.

249
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:13,294
Yeah.
Yeah. Weddings are like that.

250
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,560
Misty, your pimp
is here to see you.

251
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,127
Uh-oh...

252
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:22,469
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

253
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,975
Come on, ladies, and run.

254
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:28,439
Run, shoulders back.

255
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:32,507
The new recruits
sure look good.

256
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:35,712
Sun Yi showed great foresight
setting us up here.

257
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:38,120
Mind control,
by way of the body.

258
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:43,193
Such empty minds
crying out for fulfillment.

259
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,829
I'd like to fulfill
that one in the red.

260
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:50,730
Control, strong,
your body is your best friend.

261
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,663
I claim my divine right...

262
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:57,104
I claim my divine right...

263
00:17:57,276 --> 00:18:01,212
...to material stuff...
... to material stuff...

264
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:05,745
...before someone else does.
... before someone else does.

265
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:09,944
My body, my mind, my money.

266
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:15,593
<i>Sun Yi, Sun Yi...</i>

267
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:18,027
Okay, okay, okay,
that's enough.
Let's get down to business.

268
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,428
Bruno, you got a cigarette?
Yeah.

269
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:23,059
Let me have
the regional financial report.
It's not great news.

270
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:26,771
I told you we were gonna
have a lot of bad publicity
from that Reese interview.

271
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:29,467
Transmissions have been
very clear on this.

272
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,175
The obstacle must be removed.

273
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,774
Angela, initiate Plan A.

274
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:37,710
Yes, Your Holiness.

275
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:39,878
Plan A.

276
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:45,489
Get the big guy
in the gray limousine.

277
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:05,342
Hi, guys.
Cut the small talk,
you're late!

278
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,537
I've been playing pocket pool
up there for 15 minutes.

279
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:09,103
I got a grand opening today!

280
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:10,808
All right, all right,
where to, Sal?

281
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:13,784
Third and Elsmere.
Mr. Hound Dogs.
The hot dog people?

282
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:16,946
Yeah. They want the boys
to walk around
wearing sandwich boards.

283
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:19,513
It's not a bad idea.
Did you talk to Reese?

284
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:21,058
No, sorry.
I haven't had a chance.

285
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:23,651
Would you talk to him, Johnny?
This is important to me.

286
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:24,957
Yeah, I will.

287
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,788
Do you think you could
drop me off on the way?

288
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:28,025
Yes, I would mind actually.

289
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,034
Would you drive?
All right.

290
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:58,591
Hey, John?
Yeah?

291
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:04,134
What do you think
if we put like
a flat gray on the wall

292
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:08,867
and then maybe
a Chinese-red lacquer trim
on the molding?

293
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:10,772
Do you think that'd be good?

294
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:14,343
Yeah.
Yeah, I do, too.

295
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,287
John? John?

296
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,026
What?
John, did you hear anything
I was saying?

297
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:32,730
No. I'm practicing.

298
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:34,390
Come on, Nance.
I gotta practice.
I'm playing tonight.

299
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:36,627
Yeah, but you've been
practicing all day long.

300
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:38,067
I know, I'm bad.

301
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:41,299
What do you mean you're bad?
You're the greatest.

302
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:43,068
You're a great drummer.

303
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:45,109
Well, you tell that
to the guys tonight, okay?

304
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:47,372
I think it's amazing
what you do
with all these things.

305
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:49,209
You know, what you do
with your little foot there.

306
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:51,215
I know,
it is amazing how that works.

307
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:54,377
What you do with these...
What do you call them,
"drumstick" things?

308
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:56,944
Drumstick things,
that's very good. Yeah.
That's what they're called.

309
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:58,353
Well, why don't you show me
how to use them?

310
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,220
No, no. This takes years.
Come on.

311
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:02,021
It takes years to play this.

312
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,289
Show me.
No, I can't.
I gotta get ready to go.

313
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:06,661
Tell you what.
Just put them in your hands.
Very good, just like that.

314
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:09,257
Why don't you just sit down
and play? Go nuts, all right?

315
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:11,097
Have fun.
I gotta get ready.

316
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,027
Nancy, don't ever
do that again!

317
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,014
Excuse me. I'm looking
for a guy named Skipper.

318
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:03,782
I'm a guy named Skipper.

319
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:06,650
Damien, take that tablecloth
off there, will you?

320
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:08,590
It's all bloody.
It looks terrible.

321
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,925
And I told you
I want baby blue spots
in all those fixtures.

322
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,021
Now get to it!

323
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:14,895
I'm trying.
Yes?

324
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:17,059
I'm John Bourgignon
from the Musicians Union.

325
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:20,696
Oh, really? Well, you tell
those people over there to
take me off that unfair list.

326
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:23,332
It's unfair to me.
I didn't do a damn thing.

327
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:25,976
I don't know
anything about that.
I'm just a drummer.

328
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:29,912
Oh, thank God you're here.
Here's the costume.

329
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:33,144
Take it and put it on.
The dressing room
is right back there.

330
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:35,379
Damien, be a dear, will you,
and get me a cup of coffee?

331
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:36,819
I'm only one person.

332
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:38,788
I'm sorry,
I can't wear this.

333
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:42,157
Oh, look at the gross
national product.

334
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:43,758
After inflation, you know,
you gotta remember that.

335
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:46,059
We gotta go back
to the gold standard.

336
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:53,594
How you doing?
Hi, how are you?

337
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:55,528
Yo.

338
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:01,534
Yeah.

339
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:12,787
I don't know about this.
I've heard those ladies
can get pretty rough.

340
00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:16,521
Come on, it's a job.
With women, what can happen?

341
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:07,633
Since most of you
gentlemen are not strangers
to this court,

342
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,400
you know exactly
what kind of behavior
I will tolerate.

343
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:17,381
Any breach of courtroom
protocol will receive
the maximum penalty.

344
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:20,511
Am I understood?

345
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:25,249
Okay, let's get this
over with.

346
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:27,018
We'll start at this end.

347
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:29,116
Approach the bench
and state your case.

348
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:43,130
What are you doing here?
I set fire to my family.

349
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:55,142
Jesus Christ,
he set fire to his family.

350
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,320
Oh, my God! Oh!

351
00:25:58,757 --> 00:26:00,019
How you doing?

352
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:02,791
I don't know. I don't think
I'm doing too good.

353
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:06,854
Right. Listen,
you got any ludes?

354
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:09,400
What?
Ludes.

355
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:13,193
Shut up! The guy's a cop.
How about some reefer?

356
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:16,637
Just relax, will you?
Toot! You got any toot?

357
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:21,610
Listen, I'm freaking out!
I'm not gonna make it.

358
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,114
Get out of my pocket!
Look, we're all
freaking out, here!

359
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:27,379
Just relax, will you?
Get some control of yourself.

360
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:30,250
Think positive,
you'll be all right.
All right.

361
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:35,083
This guy over here, he just
set fire to his entire family
for God's sakes!

362
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:38,860
Just don't look at him.
Be quiet! Just relax.

363
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:39,988
You all right?
Great.

364
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:42,693
Think positive.
I'm right here if you need me.

365
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:44,457
Easy.

366
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:47,663
Where did
our public defender go?

367
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:50,234
Right here, Your Honor.
Oh, my God!

368
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:52,537
Think positive.
You don't even
know the case.

369
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,511
I know the law.
Don't you...

370
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:57,014
Would you like to consult
with your client?

371
00:26:57,082 --> 00:27:00,540
I would like
a change of venue.
Denied. Proceed.

372
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:03,548
Your Honor, then I request
a summary dismissal.

373
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:06,521
Can you support that motion?
Yes, indeed, I can.

374
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:09,388
There are thousands
of criminals roaming
all over the streets

375
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:12,328
just as guilty as my client.
Why pick on him?

376
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:14,024
What the hell are you saying?
I know what I'm doing.

377
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:15,498
Motion denied.

378
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:18,126
Your Honor, I would
very much like to have
another lawyer, please,

379
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:20,763
because this one is not
to my satisfaction.
And I would feel that...

380
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:24,138
Your Honor, I would like you
to disqualify yourself.

381
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:25,369
On what grounds?

382
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:27,411
On the grounds that
you've got a bad attitude.

383
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,538
Bad attitude?
Denied!

384
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:31,946
Counselor?
Okay.

385
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:34,111
May we approach
the bench, please?

386
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:36,843
Yes.

387
00:27:37,756 --> 00:27:40,020
Don't blow this!
Don't, don't worry.

388
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,219
Your Honor, may we speak
off the record here?

389
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:47,262
The proceedings so far
are rather pressing.
I wanted to ask you,

390
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,823
do you have a toot?
A lude, reefer?
What the hell are you saying?

391
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:51,960
You are out of order!
I'm out of order?

392
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:53,061
You're out of order!
Shut up!

393
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:54,935
You're out of order!
This whole court's
out of order!

394
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:57,873
Thirty days in
the County Jail for contempt.

395
00:27:57,942 --> 00:27:59,466
This is worse than Attica!

396
00:27:59,544 --> 00:28:03,503
Attica, that's right!
Attica! Attica!

397
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:07,677
Order! Order!
Attica! Attica!
Attica! Attica!

398
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:10,118
Order! Order in the court!
Attica! Attica!
Attica! Attica!

399
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:20,526
I mean, I'm cool.

400
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:24,394
I mean, I'm out of here.
I know.

401
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:28,127
You see I,
Muhammed Jerome Willy,

402
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:31,098
have a plan.
Yeah?

403
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:34,438
You see, Muhammed
ain't going to the joint.

404
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,648
I'm a three-time loser, man.

405
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:41,543
I mean, I'm gonna
do some time for this one.

406
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,951
And I don't feel
like dying in jail.

407
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:52,493
You with me?
What?

408
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:55,930
You with me?
What do you mean?

409
00:28:58,002 --> 00:29:00,197
We out of here. You with me?
Oh, no.

410
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:04,169
You gotta be crazy.
I'm not going with you.

411
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,437
You go yourself.
You're a murderer.

412
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:10,038
I'm just a... I didn't do...
I didn't mean that,
I didn't mean...

413
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:15,442
Make my move,
you best keep up. Dig?
I dig very much, sir.

414
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:20,316
No, wait, I've changed
my mind. Wait,
I don't wanna go with you!

415
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:22,382
I can't. Look,
I'll never keep up!

416
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:47,414
Let's go.

417
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:51,416
Oh, no. Oh, no.

418
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,993
Who is it?
It's me, baby. Open up.

419
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:37,162
Muhammed,
what are you doing here?
What do you mean,
what am I doing here?

420
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:39,533
I'm here to see you.
You look good, baby.
How about a little sugar?

421
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:42,539
Never mind the sugar.
I don't have any time.
I'm running late.

422
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:44,507
Excuse me.
Do you think I could
borrow a hacksaw?

423
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:45,702
Who's the surfer?

424
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:47,074
I just wanna borrow it,
cut this off

425
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:48,578
and I'm gone.
Later! Sit down!

426
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:51,042
Baby, you look good.

427
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:52,878
What are you doing
in handcuffs?

428
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:55,044
I got busted.
It's a long story.

429
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:58,054
That's it! Get out of
my house! I'm not harboring
escaped criminals.

430
00:30:58,122 --> 00:30:59,919
You have an acetylene torch
in there I could borrow?

431
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:01,652
Sit down!

432
00:31:01,726 --> 00:31:04,661
Well, listen how the woman
talks to the man
who pays the rent.

433
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:07,664
In your dreams.
You never paid my rent
in your life.

434
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:10,792
Well, look, I was gonna!
I just never got around to it.

435
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:13,563
It looks good, baby.

436
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:17,096
Hey, what's this?
Nothing.

437
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:18,836
What do you mean nothing?
It looks like a suitcase
to me.

438
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,605
You don't wanna know.
Don't get involved.

439
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:23,647
Hey, hey, baby, baby.
Now, where my baby going?

440
00:31:24,682 --> 00:31:26,741
I've got a date.
See, it's just a date.

441
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:29,343
A date? Looks more
serious than a date.

442
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:31,614
Looks more like
an overnight trip.

443
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,651
Hey, who you been seeing
behind my back?

444
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,090
Look, it's probably
just a pajama party.

445
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:36,751
Bunch of girls get together,
they play some records,

446
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:38,591
they have some popcorn,
pretzels. That's all it is.

447
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:42,155
Francine, get out here, now!

448
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,827
I'll come out
when I feel like it!
Look, want some advice, pal?

449
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,894
Be gentle with the woman.
Women like it
when you're gentle.

450
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:50,532
I'm gentle.
Works for me all the time.
I'm telling you, if you...

451
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:53,134
I'll just shut
the fuck right up.

452
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:55,679
I'm furious!
I don't belong to you.

453
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:59,547
I don't belong to anyone and I
advise you to get out of here
before he gets here!

454
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:02,142
Oh, lady, please, reconsider.
You could help us, you know?

455
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,620
Before who gets here?
Before he gets here!

456
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:05,849
Look, I want him
to get here.

457
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,653
As a matter of fact,
I'm in the mood for a fight.

458
00:32:07,725 --> 00:32:10,057
I'm not afraid of him,
you, you, nobody!

459
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:12,187
And no woman talks to
Muhammed Jerome Willy

460
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:14,458
the way you've been doing
and especially not in front
of company!

461
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:15,760
Well, I'm not impressed
with your company!

462
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:18,165
I'm not impressed with you,
now, just get out of here!

463
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:21,069
Look, you don't tell me
to get out. No woman tells,
nobody tells me to get out!

464
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:22,663
I'm telling you
to get out!

465
00:32:28,012 --> 00:32:30,503
I wish I could take that back.
I didn't mean to say it.

466
00:32:30,581 --> 00:32:32,208
I'm sorry I yelled.

467
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:34,308
What I wanted
to say was just

468
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:37,320
that maybe we could
all sit down like adults
and just sit down and talk.

469
00:32:37,388 --> 00:32:39,913
Look, I'm very sorry.
I'm sorry for yelling.

470
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:41,549
Fine.
See what we're into now?
We're yelling.

471
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,491
Fine. Sit down.
Let's sit down
like adults, right?

472
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:44,687
Now?
Fine.

473
00:32:47,565 --> 00:32:50,056
You're nothing but a goddamn
lazy no-good fool!

474
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:52,466
And you're nothing
but a two-timing bitch!

475
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:55,267
You're nothing but trouble!
I hope they hang your ass!

476
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,638
Good! Because that's just
what they're gonna do!

477
00:32:57,709 --> 00:33:00,200
Well, doesn't that
feel better now? Huh?

478
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,470
Let's get out of here!
Come on!

479
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,375
Break out!
Running and hiding
from the police!

480
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:07,850
Come all the way
over here to see you.

481
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,786
Only reason we came over
anyway was to say goodbye.

482
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:14,519
That's why you came over?
To say goodbye?

483
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,028
You mean in the midst
of all that trouble
you came over to see me?

484
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:21,065
That's right. That's okay,
'cause I'm ready
to face the heat.

485
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:24,260
Now, I know the police out
there with their machine guns
and helicopters.

486
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,826
We gonna get blown away,
but that's all right, too,

487
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:28,895
'cause we ready to die!
No, we're not.

488
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:33,205
At least I got a chance
to behold my baby's face
one last time.

489
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:39,512
Listen to this here.

490
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:45,447
Muhammed, don't go.
Say "please. "

491
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:46,512
Please.

492
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:52,356
Please.
Baby, I love the way
you say, "Please. "

493
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,795
That was a great "please. "

494
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,332
So good to Muhammed.

495
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:59,802
Did my big Muhammed miss me?

496
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,668
Baby, Muhammed missed you.

497
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:04,438
How much did he miss me?

498
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:06,340
I missed the smell
of your hair,

499
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:07,776
the taste of your neck.

500
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:09,945
Don't waste it.

501
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,476
Oh!

502
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:14,541
Oh, no. Hey, man,
you got to go!
Why?

503
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:16,779
Now.
Don't! Oh, come on.

504
00:34:16,854 --> 00:34:18,446
Bye.
I won't.

505
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:21,856
Thank you.
Let's jump to it, baby.

506
00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:26,463
About how long?
Not long. Get out of here!

507
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,214
Oh, baby! Oh, baby!

508
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:47,106
Yes. Good.

509
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,112
Oh, God!
It's been so long.

510
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:55,481
Oh, I missed you.

511
00:34:57,361 --> 00:34:58,350
I missed you so much.

512
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:02,891
There you are,
right there. Good.

513
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:06,927
Oh, Muhammed, you thrill me!
Oh, you thrill me!

514
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:17,140
So good. So good.

515
00:35:30,094 --> 00:35:31,823
Can I give you a hand there?
Yeah, would you?

516
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:33,420
Yeah, sure.
Would you hold this
while I open my door?

517
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:34,590
No problem.

518
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:43,866
Yes, yes, yes.
That's it!

519
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:00,687
Thanks.
Yeah, sure.

520
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:09,956
Push, push, push, push,
push, push! Oh, baby!

521
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:14,697
You're the king!
You're the king!

522
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:22,638
Muhammed! Muhammed?

523
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:26,413
Oh, my God!
What's wrong?

524
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:27,712
He's dead!
What?

525
00:36:27,785 --> 00:36:30,219
He's dead! Oh, my God,
he's dead!
He's what?

526
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:31,277
Dead.

527
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:05,420
Chick? Yeah, it's me, John.
Look, I'm in a little bit
of trouble here.

528
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:09,425
I wonder if you could
come down and move real
quickly and get down here?

529
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:11,251
Yeah. I'm at...

530
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,158
Okay, boys, last call.
Yeah.

531
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:21,672
I'll have another draft,
please, and another
screwdriver for my friend.

532
00:37:21,806 --> 00:37:23,967
What's the matter
with your friend?

533
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:26,936
Just... Just still meditating.

534
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:29,377
He looks drunk
as a skunk to me.
Yeah.

535
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:35,646
I just hope that rigor mortis
doesn't set in.

536
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:40,453
Whoa! Hey,
Muhammed Jerome Willy.

537
00:37:40,524 --> 00:37:42,754
My man. What's up?

538
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:46,854
What's happening, blood?
Hey, man, that's me.

539
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:50,094
Wallace Jefferson,
you remember me?
P.S. 303?

540
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:54,695
Draft beer for you
and a screwdriver
for Mr. Personality.

541
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:55,830
Thanks.
Oh, man.

542
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:58,841
Hey, man, you remember
Maurice Walker, the car thief?

543
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:03,447
He's dead.
Yeah, his old lady threw him
down an elevator shaft.

544
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:07,209
That must have happened...
That must have been three,
four years ago, man.

545
00:38:08,552 --> 00:38:10,042
I got me a new ride.

546
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,884
I'm talking about
cocoa brown, drop-top...

547
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,753
The guy next to me is dead!
He's dead?

548
00:38:13,824 --> 00:38:15,724
Who's the other guy?
I don't know.

549
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:17,818
Did you bring it?
Yeah, I got it here.

550
00:38:17,895 --> 00:38:20,489
Just cut,
just cut these off.

551
00:38:20,564 --> 00:38:23,499
Well, so how have you been,
Muhammed? You was always
the loose cat.

552
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:25,296
Always the laugh of the party.
Really?

553
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:26,802
You know, that's,
that's what he was saying.

554
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:29,396
Oh, yeah.
They always depend
on Muhammed.

555
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:30,701
Really?
This is my main man.

556
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:32,504
You in good company, Jack.

557
00:38:33,611 --> 00:38:36,546
We were just talking
about you.
Yeah, he done
mellowed out a lot, man.

558
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:39,674
That's good, brother,
that's good.
Same thing with me, too.

559
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,945
Are you still
with Francine? Huh?

560
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:44,687
You know, I've been meaning
to talk to you about that.

561
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:46,245
I mean, that's a heck
of a woman you got there.

562
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,815
Personally, I never thought
you had the energy for her.

563
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:51,191
Yeah, but I can see
you done mellowed out now.

564
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:54,595
You cool,
and that's good, brother,
because you know we get older,

565
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,963
we got to start thinking
about our future, man.

566
00:38:57,034 --> 00:39:00,367
You know?
What you looking at, bro?

567
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:03,099
Tell you all about it later.
I just wanna get out of here.

568
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:06,200
Yeah, well, I feel kind of
funny just leaving him
sit there like that.

569
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:08,404
Yeah, well, at least
he's with his friend.

570
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:12,575
Oh, by the way, Nancy set up
a meeting between Ed Reese
and Sal for tomorrow.

571
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,208
Oh, I can't make it.
I'm exhausted.

572
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:16,014
Man, you got
to cover for me.

573
00:39:16,087 --> 00:39:18,317
All right, all right,
get some rest.
I'll cover for you.

574
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:19,617
Pal, I owe you for this.

575
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,929
Nice tits,
huh, Congressman?

576
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:35,303
I'm terribly sorry.
I meant to say breasts.

577
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:37,497
That was very crass,
I'm sorry.

578
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:41,705
Your wife was
a very beautiful woman,
Mr. Di Pasquale.

579
00:39:41,779 --> 00:39:43,269
Yes, she was, Nancy.

580
00:39:43,814 --> 00:39:45,213
She certainly was.

581
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:47,942
See, she was,
she wanted to be an actress.

582
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:51,317
I was a very important
film director at that time.

583
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,755
Very important,
prominent movie director.

584
00:39:53,824 --> 00:39:57,453
And she was using me
to get to the top and that...

585
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:02,223
That hurt me very,
very deeply.

586
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:04,494
Let's get this thing signed,
shall we?

587
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,968
I have other things
on my agenda this evening.

588
00:40:07,037 --> 00:40:08,231
I'm sure you do,
Congressman.

589
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:10,967
I mean, what with running
for President and all,
you know.

590
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:12,167
Please have a seat.

591
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:16,009
<i>Nancy, asseyez-vous
as they say in Paris.</i>

592
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,707
I'll get some champagne

593
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:25,114
'cause I wanna
propose a toast.

594
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:28,757
Thank you.
Okay. That's good.

595
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:33,420
To a very successful campaign,

596
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:37,492
and an equally
successful marriage.

597
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:44,738
That's warm.

598
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,877
I just picked it up.
I didn't have a chance
to chill it.

599
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:49,572
It's not bad.
I think it's French.

600
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:52,810
I hope you understand,
Mr. Di Pasquale,

601
00:40:52,883 --> 00:40:56,785
I like the idea of capturing
my daughter's wedding on film.

602
00:40:57,154 --> 00:40:59,281
I think the American public
would enjoy

603
00:40:59,356 --> 00:41:01,756
seeing the daughter
of a prominent politician

604
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:05,489
marry a ordinary,
hard-working American boy,

605
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:08,363
but I'm not at all
acquainted with your work

606
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:09,956
and on first impression,

607
00:41:10,034 --> 00:41:14,300
I'm not at all impressed
by your lifestyle
or your character.

608
00:41:16,073 --> 00:41:17,062
Hm.

609
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:21,707
Why don't we just take
a look at Mr. Di Pasquale's
film, Daddy?

610
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:24,145
That's a wonderful idea,
Congressman.

611
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:25,580
Why don't we
look at the film?

612
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:27,549
And then it... Chick.

613
00:41:30,454 --> 00:41:32,149
'Cause I think my work
speaks for itself.

614
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:34,350
You wanna get the lights
while you're back there,
Chick?

615
00:41:50,307 --> 00:41:52,969
<i>Kung Fu U!</i>

616
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:56,810
This was a very difficult
film to put together.

617
00:41:56,881 --> 00:41:58,610
<i>Hey, young fella, listen!</i>

618
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:01,283
<i>Why don't you try out some
of our other facilities
besides the cafeteria?</i>

619
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,377
<i>That's right!
We've got a lot of facilities
here like,</i>

620
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:06,287
<i>well, the athletic department
and there's a wonderful
library, too.</i>

621
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:08,086
<i>Yes, I know.
Why don't you check them out?</i>

622
00:42:08,158 --> 00:42:09,523
<i>Okay.
When you get a chance.</i>

623
00:42:09,593 --> 00:42:11,220
<i>I'll do that.
Now, just beat it!</i>

624
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:13,422
<i>Thanks very much.
See you tonight.</i>

625
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:16,623
<i>So the Korean said, "Lice?
I thought you meant rice. "</i>

626
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:21,903
<i>Oh, that's funny.</i>

627
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:47,731
<i>Hey, you, freshman,
go get me some food.
Snap to it.</i>

628
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:50,022
<i>Joe!</i>

629
00:42:56,907 --> 00:43:01,105
Now that scene there
was critically acclaimed
in papers across this country.

630
00:43:01,178 --> 00:43:02,839
The reviewers ate it up.

631
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:06,314
<i>We must teach them a lesson.
Seduce her!</i>

632
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:11,177
<i>Can't you read the sign?
No seducing in the cafeteria!</i>

633
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:15,152
<i>Now you pay the piper.</i>

634
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:38,541
It was very big in France.

635
00:43:59,703 --> 00:44:02,137
<i>One, two, and one and two.</i>

636
00:44:03,741 --> 00:44:05,265
<i>Oh, there you go.</i>

637
00:44:05,342 --> 00:44:07,401
<i>You want some? All right, you.</i>

638
00:44:13,283 --> 00:44:17,276
I've seen enough.
Oh, well, I thought
that's all it would take.

639
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:22,751
Nancy, honey, will you wait
for me down in the limousine?

640
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:24,123
Let me talk a little...
Oh, sure, Daddy.

641
00:44:24,194 --> 00:44:26,219
...business
to Mr. Di Pasquale.

642
00:44:26,563 --> 00:44:27,860
That's a good idea,
Congressman.

643
00:44:27,931 --> 00:44:29,558
I won't be long, baby.
Okay.

644
00:44:29,633 --> 00:44:32,193
They don't have to know.
Take him with you, will you?

645
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:34,134
Nice meeting you, Nancy.
Sure, my pleasure.

646
00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:36,195
Chick, we'll see...
Okay.

647
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:40,343
So, Congressman,
where shall we start here?

648
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:43,403
I have some marvelous ideas
about the procession itself,

649
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:46,005
but if you wanna talk
money then maybe
we should talk budget.

650
00:44:46,083 --> 00:44:50,349
I wouldn't give you
a wooden nickel to film
my daughter's wedding.

651
00:44:50,421 --> 00:44:54,414
I think this whole wedding
idea is a very bum idea.

652
00:44:55,092 --> 00:44:58,391
I'm sorry to hear you
say that, Congressman.

653
00:44:58,462 --> 00:45:02,558
You know, I didn't really
wanna have to do this,
but you know, I got to...

654
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:06,330
Have you,
have you ever heard
of the Del Marina Motel?

655
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:09,700
What are you talking about?

656
00:45:09,773 --> 00:45:13,436
Well, sir, it might be
coincidental but I just,
I got a property...

657
00:45:14,511 --> 00:45:17,639
And it seems to have
your name on it,

658
00:45:18,315 --> 00:45:21,045
unless, of course,
there's a different Ed Reese.

659
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:23,977
I thought you might wanna
take a look at it.

660
00:45:45,142 --> 00:45:50,808
<i>Calling Limo One.
Dispatch. Come in, Limo One.</i>

661
00:45:51,982 --> 00:45:54,917
<i>Yeah, this is Limo One.
We only got one limo.</i>

662
00:45:54,985 --> 00:45:56,475
<i>Well, that's Limo One,
I guess.</i>

663
00:45:56,553 --> 00:45:59,488
<i>What do you want, Chick?</i>

664
00:45:59,556 --> 00:46:01,683
<i>Look, don't forget
to get over to
the aerobics clinic tonight.</i>

665
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:04,023
<i>That lady asked
for you specifically.</i>

666
00:46:04,194 --> 00:46:08,255
<i>Yeah, all right. I think what
I'll do is, I'm gonna go
to Moms and grab a burger.</i>

667
00:46:08,332 --> 00:46:10,892
<i>Boy, I haven't been there
in years. I've been
craving burgers all day.</i>

668
00:46:11,702 --> 00:46:13,329
<i>Have a nice quiet
meal at Moms.</i>

669
00:46:47,938 --> 00:46:51,237
Please, don't do anything
to my head, sir.
I will pay for it...

670
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:55,244
I will pay for any
inconvenience or damage
done to this...

671
00:47:45,929 --> 00:47:48,227
Come on.
What happened
to the music?

672
00:47:48,298 --> 00:47:51,734
It's music, come on, music.
Come on.

673
00:47:51,802 --> 00:47:54,430
I don't like purple-headed
faggots jumping up and down!

674
00:47:54,504 --> 00:47:56,734
Hey, why don't you
just leave us alone?

675
00:47:56,807 --> 00:47:58,672
Oh, got pink hair
all over, huh?

676
00:47:59,443 --> 00:48:00,842
What are you supposed to be,
a rooster or something?

677
00:48:00,911 --> 00:48:03,709
Hey, hey, come on,
gentlemen, gentlemen,
please, ladies!

678
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:06,715
Come on, have we
forgotten our own youth?

679
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:09,375
You don't remember
the '60s?

680
00:48:09,453 --> 00:48:11,216
How rebellious
our music was?

681
00:48:11,288 --> 00:48:13,188
Come on, have you
forgotten acid rock?

682
00:48:13,257 --> 00:48:15,418
Jimi Hendrix, Woodstock!

683
00:48:16,293 --> 00:48:20,252
As far as the hair goes,
didn't our own long hair
turn a few heads?

684
00:48:21,198 --> 00:48:22,631
Really, you know,

685
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:25,532
we should appreciate
another generation's
cultural movement.

686
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:28,602
Fuck you, hippie.

687
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:33,869
"Fuck you, hippie. "

688
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:36,610
"Fuck you, hippie. "

689
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:40,177
You know,
I would accept that,
you know,

690
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,775
from anyone else but you,
you fucking rooster head.

691
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:50,492
I expect it from you,
but you owe me an apology.

692
00:48:51,828 --> 00:48:52,954
He's right.

693
00:48:56,500 --> 00:49:01,870
S-O-R...
S-O-R...

694
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:04,499
R-Y.

695
00:49:04,574 --> 00:49:08,510
S-O-R-R-Y. Sorry.

696
00:49:09,646 --> 00:49:11,773
Period.
Yeah.

697
00:49:11,848 --> 00:49:13,042
The end.

698
00:49:18,855 --> 00:49:20,117
You know what?

699
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:25,061
We've got a failure
to communicate.
That's what it is.

700
00:49:26,697 --> 00:49:29,097
Now, I could stay here
all day long,

701
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,264
and I could take each one
of you on, one at a time.

702
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:33,860
But I'm not going to.

703
00:49:34,371 --> 00:49:36,771
I'm going to leave you
with one thought.

704
00:49:38,275 --> 00:49:42,177
This simple message.
I still believe in it.

705
00:49:43,513 --> 00:49:45,378
Because this is right.

706
00:49:46,383 --> 00:49:49,819
I love all of you,
my brothers and sisters.

707
00:49:51,455 --> 00:49:57,724
Peace. I'm leaving. Peace.

708
00:50:06,303 --> 00:50:07,702
Hey, motor bum.

709
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:05,589
Higher, higher,
lift and reach. Reach.

710
00:51:05,662 --> 00:51:07,687
Reach for beauty,
reach for peace.

711
00:51:07,764 --> 00:51:10,995
Reach for money and success,
and reach.

712
00:51:14,204 --> 00:51:15,398
Reach.

713
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:19,069
Good, here comes our boy.

714
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:22,801
Set everything up.
This could prove
to be very interesting.

715
00:51:29,052 --> 00:51:31,714
Reach.
Reach for beauty.

716
00:51:31,788 --> 00:51:35,280
Reach for peace,
reach for money
and success, reach.

717
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:37,121
Excuse me,
sorry to bother you.

718
00:51:37,194 --> 00:51:38,889
Limousine guy.

719
00:51:39,463 --> 00:51:41,021
Take them more often.

720
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:46,667
Hi, excuse me, you are...

721
00:51:47,737 --> 00:51:50,297
Hi, how are you.
Limousine's out there.

722
00:51:51,341 --> 00:51:53,809
I'll wait here,
I'll just wait here.

723
00:51:53,877 --> 00:51:58,439
Reach, reach for beauty,
reach for peace,
reach for money and success.

724
00:51:58,515 --> 00:52:01,040
And stretch, stretch.
Stretch, use it all...

725
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:02,676
Limousine!

726
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:06,348
Sorry. I got
the limousine
right in front.

727
00:52:06,423 --> 00:52:08,516
I'm a little early.
I'm very sorry.
I'll wait out there for you.

728
00:52:08,592 --> 00:52:10,355
Whenever you're ready,
I'm right out front.

729
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:13,453
Come in for a second.
Come in?

730
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:21,061
This is our driver.

731
00:52:22,506 --> 00:52:25,600
Hi, John Bourgignon.
Pleased to meet you.
Bruno, hi.

732
00:52:25,675 --> 00:52:27,905
I'm Clarence.
Clarence, how are you?

733
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:29,377
Nice to meet you, John.

734
00:52:29,446 --> 00:52:31,437
So, where are we
going this evening?

735
00:52:32,849 --> 00:52:35,283
Where are we
going this evening?
Where?

736
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:37,919
We're going out.

737
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:40,721
We'll tell you
on the way there.
Okay.

738
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:43,554
How about a drink, John?
Not for me, thanks,
I'm driving.

739
00:52:43,627 --> 00:52:46,755
We insist.
Just one drink before
we start our evening.

740
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:48,893
I really can't.
It's company policy.

741
00:52:48,965 --> 00:52:50,830
Oh, please, John,
you must have one.

742
00:52:50,901 --> 00:52:52,766
I can't break
the company policy.

743
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:56,294
Come on.
I can't... Break it.

744
00:52:57,207 --> 00:52:58,765
Cheers.
Cheers.

745
00:52:58,875 --> 00:53:01,139
It's bad luck
if you don't all clink.

746
00:53:06,983 --> 00:53:08,917
We'll have ours later.
I see.

747
00:53:10,487 --> 00:53:13,149
Does it come in that bottle?
I'd like to get
the name of that.

748
00:53:13,223 --> 00:53:15,123
I'm having a little
party later on.

749
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:19,253
How are you feeling?
Me? I'm...

750
00:53:20,764 --> 00:53:22,129
I don't feel very good.

751
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:25,259
Why don't you
sit down, John?
Thank you. Yeah, I will.

752
00:53:26,303 --> 00:53:28,965
I kind of gulped it a little
fast there. That was the...

753
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:31,667
I shouldn't do that,
you know. I've done that
since I was a kid.

754
00:53:31,741 --> 00:53:33,333
I have this bad habit.

755
00:53:38,348 --> 00:53:40,782
Just relax, John.
All right.

756
00:53:41,585 --> 00:53:45,646
Look at the girls.
Lovely, long-limbed bodies.

757
00:53:46,356 --> 00:53:50,292
John, someone wants to
take their bodies away.

758
00:53:51,695 --> 00:53:55,859
No, you got to be kidding.
Those bodies?
Oh, not a chance.

759
00:53:55,932 --> 00:53:57,695
He's in our power.

760
00:53:58,969 --> 00:54:00,368
Show me something.

761
00:54:00,503 --> 00:54:02,937
Is this a dream, John?
I don't know.

762
00:54:04,374 --> 00:54:08,504
I am the only one
on this planet.
The only one in the universe.

763
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:12,537
I am your world, John.
Okay, I'll buy that.

764
00:54:12,616 --> 00:54:16,382
You'd do anything for me,
wouldn't you?
Yes, sure.

765
00:54:16,453 --> 00:54:21,049
Even kill your future
father-in-law.
Okay, why not?

766
00:54:21,858 --> 00:54:24,656
Bark like a dog.
Shut up!

767
00:54:24,728 --> 00:54:27,196
Thank you, John,
that won't be necessary.

768
00:54:27,297 --> 00:54:29,322
Very good dog, though.
Continue.

769
00:54:29,899 --> 00:54:32,663
Tomorrow you'll be going
to your wedding rehearsal.

770
00:54:32,736 --> 00:54:37,036
At a certain point
someone will come up to you
with a playing card.

771
00:54:38,375 --> 00:54:41,708
That card will be
the five of spades.

772
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:46,313
John, do you see this man?
Yes.

773
00:54:46,383 --> 00:54:49,045
This man wants to
take away the bodies.

774
00:54:49,486 --> 00:54:54,150
When you see this card,
you will kill this man.

775
00:55:01,331 --> 00:55:02,798
Heel! Heel!

776
00:55:02,999 --> 00:55:04,762
Now, see what you did? Idiot!

777
00:55:04,834 --> 00:55:07,769
Walkies. Sit, sit.

778
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:12,702
Yeah!

779
00:55:12,776 --> 00:55:15,074
SUN Yl: What's this?
That's not a killer,
that's a schmuck!

780
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:16,874
Something has gone wrong.

781
00:55:17,013 --> 00:55:20,141
The hypnosis has magnified
his most juvenile traits.

782
00:55:20,717 --> 00:55:22,514
Well, is he gonna
kill Reese or not?

783
00:55:22,585 --> 00:55:25,145
We won't know until
he sees the five
of spades again.

784
00:55:35,465 --> 00:55:38,593
That irresponsible bastard,
I'm gonna kill him.

785
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:40,932
Please, Mr. Reese,
this is a house of worship.

786
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:43,097
Oh, for God's sake!
Where is he?

787
00:55:43,573 --> 00:55:45,803
Now what's the real story,
you little weasel?

788
00:55:45,875 --> 00:55:48,343
Mr. Reese,
I'm sure he had a late fare.

789
00:55:48,411 --> 00:55:51,380
I mean, you don't realize
how hard he's been working.

790
00:55:55,819 --> 00:55:58,845
There he is now.
Hi, sweetheart.
Hi.

791
00:55:58,922 --> 00:56:00,253
Where have you been?
I overslept.

792
00:56:00,323 --> 00:56:01,813
Everyone's been waiting.

793
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:04,621
Now let me get this straight.
Patti shows him
the five of spades.

794
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:06,525
And he either turns
into a killer or a schmuck?

795
00:56:06,596 --> 00:56:07,585
Yes, Your Holiness.

796
00:56:08,164 --> 00:56:10,462
Why don't we all
assume our positions?

797
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:13,529
Has anyone seen Patti?
No, I'll go find her.

798
00:56:13,603 --> 00:56:15,036
Oh, thanks, John.

799
00:56:19,075 --> 00:56:20,975
Patti, what are you
doing here? Come on,
what's going on here?

800
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:23,877
John, would you sit down?
They're waiting out there.

801
00:56:23,947 --> 00:56:26,472
Sit down!
What is it?

802
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:29,415
I have something
that I have to show you.

803
00:56:29,486 --> 00:56:32,614
Come on, they're...
It's very important
that you see this.

804
00:56:32,689 --> 00:56:35,522
It's a matter
of life and death.
What is it?

805
00:56:44,801 --> 00:56:48,897
Okay, we'll start
off with "Dearly beloved"
and all that,

806
00:56:49,272 --> 00:56:51,706
then we'll move straight
into the personal vows

807
00:56:51,775 --> 00:56:54,505
that Nancy and John
have written for themselves.

808
00:56:54,944 --> 00:56:58,471
Would you care to
read those, folks,
so I'll know what to expect?

809
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:06,613
"I, Nancy, take thee, John,
in soul and body

810
00:57:07,724 --> 00:57:13,390
"and offer all my love
to thee, as our separate
lives merge into one. "

811
00:57:13,463 --> 00:57:16,489
Lovely.
Wait, I'm not
quite finished yet.

812
00:57:16,566 --> 00:57:21,367
"With this ring,
a circle of our
precious love,

813
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:23,936
"I thee wed. "

814
00:57:25,475 --> 00:57:28,933
Is that it?
Yes, and then John
pledges his vows.

815
00:57:30,547 --> 00:57:34,210
John?
Let's consummate
the marriage now!

816
00:57:34,684 --> 00:57:35,810
Dive! Dive!

817
00:57:35,885 --> 00:57:38,012
Yeah!

818
00:57:38,087 --> 00:57:39,611
It's hickey time!

819
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:42,382
He's acting like a schmuck.

820
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:44,154
He's not gonna kill anybody.
No, he's not.

821
00:57:44,227 --> 00:57:45,592
He'll have to be
reprogrammed.

822
00:57:45,662 --> 00:57:48,222
Well, what's he gonna do?
There's no telling
what he'll do.

823
00:57:52,735 --> 00:57:54,760
A little decorum, please!

824
00:57:55,939 --> 00:57:59,705
Did you say decorum?
Did you say decorum?

825
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:03,802
That big word coming out
of that little cute mouth.
Say "decorum" again.

826
00:58:03,913 --> 00:58:06,677
Decorum! Decorum.

827
00:58:06,749 --> 00:58:09,741
I'm gonna put you up
on my mantle. There you go.
You sit right there.

828
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:10,979
I wanna talk to everybody.

829
00:58:11,054 --> 00:58:15,821
Mom, Dad, Grandma,
Patti, Nancy, I'd like
to talk about my dick.

830
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:20,027
John, what are you doing?
It's about this wide.
And it's about...

831
00:58:20,296 --> 00:58:22,628
I'm gonna kill him!
Who's Dick?

832
00:58:24,567 --> 00:58:28,367
Like I keep telling you,
I don't know. I draw a blank.
I can't remember anything.

833
00:58:28,438 --> 00:58:29,769
What'd I say
to that minister?

834
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:31,636
You looked him
right in the eye and you
said it was that big.

835
00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:35,337
Oh, my God,
I'm gonna kill myself.
How big?

836
00:58:35,478 --> 00:58:38,811
Never mind. Now look,
this psychiatrist
we're going to is great.

837
00:58:38,882 --> 00:58:41,942
In fact, he's the one
that cured Sal.
I am gonna kill myself.

838
00:58:42,118 --> 00:58:44,882
What the hell is that?
A mushroom?
It's a brain. Come on.

839
00:58:45,221 --> 00:58:46,279
Mushroom.

840
00:58:46,823 --> 00:58:49,223
You must have some fear
that's unspoken.

841
00:58:49,492 --> 00:58:52,256
You must have some dream,
a recurrent nightmare.

842
00:58:52,662 --> 00:58:54,027
What haunts you?

843
00:58:55,131 --> 00:58:58,498
A dream?
I got a dream that comes
almost every night,

844
00:58:58,568 --> 00:59:00,160
or every other night.

845
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:02,204
All right,
tell me about that.

846
00:59:02,572 --> 00:59:06,133
Well, I don't know,
it's a little embarrassing.
I don't think I can...

847
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:07,369
No, not at all.

848
00:59:07,443 --> 00:59:09,638
Oh, you know,
it's one of those dreams
you don't wanna talk about.

849
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:11,407
You're among friends.
I know, I...

850
00:59:11,481 --> 00:59:13,745
You can trust me,
I'm a professional.

851
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:16,313
Yeah.
Come on.

852
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:18,285
All right,
what the hell.

853
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:22,182
Well, I...

854
00:59:23,493 --> 00:59:25,859
It always starts on
this desert island.

855
00:59:26,195 --> 00:59:29,722
And there's
this beautiful girl there.

856
00:59:30,633 --> 00:59:33,466
<i>I must admit, I am kind of
sexy in this dream.</i>

857
00:59:34,437 --> 00:59:36,371
<i>Did you ever see that movie
The Blue Lagoon?</i>

858
00:59:36,439 --> 00:59:38,907
<i>Well, it's kind of like that,
I guess.</i>

859
00:59:38,975 --> 00:59:41,409
<i>I'm on this island
with this beautiful girl.</i>

860
00:59:41,477 --> 00:59:43,604
<i>I don't know
how she got there,
but it's a dream.</i>

861
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,978
<i>You can do whatever you want
in a dream, right?</i>

862
00:59:46,049 --> 00:59:48,244
<i>I really, I think,
turn her on a lot,</i>

863
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:50,252
<i>but I'm not,
I'm not into that,
you know?</i>

864
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:52,413
<i>No, she wants games
all the time.</i>

865
00:59:55,825 --> 00:59:59,591
<i>She keeps on eating fruit
in front of me to show me
that she's horny.</i>

866
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:01,423
<i>Now, this drives me crazy.</i>

867
01:00:01,497 --> 01:00:04,022
<i>But no, I don't bite.</i>

868
01:00:07,403 --> 01:00:11,100
<i>We meet at our palace.
This palace that I built
on the beach.</i>

869
01:00:12,542 --> 01:00:17,172
<i>And I know this is the night
that has got to be
the big confrontation.</i>

870
01:00:18,147 --> 01:00:19,409
<i>She wants it.</i>

871
01:00:20,083 --> 01:00:23,143
<i>It's like a nymphomaniac
in heat, if that's possible,</i>

872
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:25,515
<i>but that's the way she is.</i>

873
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:28,655
<i>I can't do it.
I just can't do it with her.</i>

874
01:00:28,725 --> 01:00:30,750
<i>No matter how much
I want to, I can't.</i>

875
01:00:30,827 --> 01:00:33,796
<i>I got to say no to her,
and it drives her crazy.</i>

876
01:00:33,863 --> 01:00:36,331
<i>She's begging me,
she keeps begging me.</i>

877
01:00:36,399 --> 01:00:38,094
<i>But I won't allow it.</i>

878
01:00:39,936 --> 01:00:42,632
<i>She keeps pounding on the door.
She's driving me crazy.</i>

879
01:00:42,705 --> 01:00:44,696
<i>It's like a bad nightmare.</i>

880
01:00:45,241 --> 01:00:47,971
<i>At this point,
I wanna wake up
but I just can't.</i>

881
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:53,248
<i>"More, more, more,"
she screams. "More.
I need you, I want you. "</i>

882
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:54,305
<i>I can't.</i>

883
01:00:54,384 --> 01:00:56,249
<i>So I go off to be alone
with my thoughts.</i>

884
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:58,719
<i>I'm alone, alone,
alone, alone,</i>

885
01:00:58,788 --> 01:01:04,522
<i>alone, alone, alone, alone...</i>

886
01:01:04,594 --> 01:01:07,085
<i>And I look up,
and I'm not alone anymore!</i>

887
01:01:07,363 --> 01:01:10,389
<i>There's a big ship in front
of me. It's like the cast
and crew of Love Boat,</i>

888
01:01:10,466 --> 01:01:12,900
<i>all looking down
laughing at me,
pointing and laughing and...</i>

889
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:18,231
<i>I was standing there alone
just holding that one little
thought in my head.</i>

890
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:23,203
<i>I'm so embarrassed and I smile</i>

891
01:01:23,279 --> 01:01:25,804
<i>and I just can't do anything
and they're still laughing.</i>

892
01:01:25,882 --> 01:01:29,340
<i>Oh, it's disgusting.
I'm so alone and...</i>

893
01:01:33,423 --> 01:01:36,324
Oh, that's funny.
Look at his problem.

894
01:01:38,327 --> 01:01:40,454
Oh, that's great.
Thanks a lot. Thank you.

895
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:42,964
Thank you very much.
That's wonderful.

896
01:01:44,167 --> 01:01:46,158
What do you make
of that, Doctor?

897
01:01:46,235 --> 01:01:50,831
Well, if you want my
professional opinion, I think
someone has altered his mind.

898
01:01:51,307 --> 01:01:53,605
Altered his mind?
Why do you think that?
That's right.

899
01:01:53,676 --> 01:01:56,873
Well, his fear of fantasy
is too vivid.

900
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:59,147
I don't trust that.

901
01:01:59,449 --> 01:02:02,043
You see, I think you've
been put under some sort of

902
01:02:02,118 --> 01:02:03,847
post-hypnotic suggestion.

903
01:02:05,788 --> 01:02:08,086
Like, you know,
the Amazing Kreskin?

904
01:02:08,157 --> 01:02:09,784
Oh, no,
it's not as simple

905
01:02:09,859 --> 01:02:12,953
<i>as just memorizing
a few names from
the Tonight Show audience.</i>

906
01:02:13,029 --> 01:02:16,089
I think your friend
has been put under
an actual spell.

907
01:02:16,432 --> 01:02:19,333
There's only one way
to cure that.
What's that?

908
01:02:19,869 --> 01:02:23,236
To drop him
on his fucking head.
There you go.
Drop me on my fucking...

909
01:02:27,610 --> 01:02:29,134
I'm gonna drop you.

910
01:02:29,212 --> 01:02:30,611
Doc, what are
you doing?

911
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:33,410
This is fear therapy.
It's just like curing
the hiccups.

912
01:02:33,483 --> 01:02:35,951
You see that Pinto?
That's my target.

913
01:02:36,619 --> 01:02:39,747
Is this gonna work?
I don't know,
but I bet the spell is gone.

914
01:02:40,656 --> 01:02:42,851
So how do you feel?
Nice and refreshed?
I feel all right.

915
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:45,155
Good. Good.
Now, you talked to her,
what did she say?

916
01:02:45,228 --> 01:02:46,718
Yeah, I talked to her
while you were in the shower.

917
01:02:46,796 --> 01:02:47,820
Yeah.

918
01:02:47,897 --> 01:02:50,058
She said she was willing
to meet you here
at the restaurant.

919
01:02:50,133 --> 01:02:51,532
That's it? What else?

920
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:54,035
Look, you're lucky
you got that much
out of her, believe me.

921
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:55,229
Now, what are you
gonna say to her?

922
01:02:55,304 --> 01:02:56,703
Oh, I'm gonna
take your advice.

923
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:58,001
I'm gonna sit her down,

924
01:02:58,074 --> 01:02:59,769
look her right
in the eyes...
Yeah.

925
01:02:59,842 --> 01:03:02,276
...and lie my ass off.
Always works, Johnny.

926
01:03:06,916 --> 01:03:09,316
There she is.
All right, let's go.

927
01:03:09,385 --> 01:03:10,784
Naw, she looks pissed.
I'm gonna have a drink.

928
01:03:10,853 --> 01:03:14,380
Me, too. I'll have...
Get over there! Go on.

929
01:03:14,557 --> 01:03:15,990
Hi, Nance.

930
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:18,760
Mind if I sit here?

931
01:03:20,696 --> 01:03:22,061
Thank you.

932
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:25,658
So...

933
01:03:26,836 --> 01:03:28,030
So.

934
01:03:28,104 --> 01:03:31,733
I have never
been so embarrassed
in my entire life, John.

935
01:03:33,042 --> 01:03:34,805
Well, why don't we leave?
We don't have to stay here.

936
01:03:34,877 --> 01:03:36,344
You don't like it,
I don't like it either.

937
01:03:36,412 --> 01:03:37,538
You know, let's go.
I don't even know why

938
01:03:37,613 --> 01:03:39,103
I'm bothering to stay here
and talk to you.

939
01:03:39,215 --> 01:03:42,116
Hey, come on, Nance,
give me a break, please,
let me explain.

940
01:03:42,185 --> 01:03:43,482
Give me a chance.

941
01:03:43,553 --> 01:03:46,249
Five minutes,
that's all I want.
All right?

942
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:48,316
Okay.

943
01:03:49,425 --> 01:03:50,483
You see,

944
01:03:51,894 --> 01:03:54,192
I think I've really...

945
01:03:55,131 --> 01:03:56,962
I don't have any control
over myself anymore.

946
01:03:57,033 --> 01:03:58,466
I seem to have lost it.

947
01:03:58,534 --> 01:04:00,764
Oh, you can say
that again.

948
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:02,896
My father wants
to kill you, John.

949
01:04:02,972 --> 01:04:04,803
Sure.
You're frightening.

950
01:04:04,874 --> 01:04:07,172
I don't even know
who you are anymore.

951
01:04:07,310 --> 01:04:08,538
Neither do I.

952
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:12,045
Neither do I, Nancy,
and that's why I went
to a psychiatrist.

953
01:04:13,015 --> 01:04:14,004
You did?

954
01:04:14,083 --> 01:04:17,484
I didn't want to tell you,
but, yes, I went
to a psychiatrist.

955
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:19,382
What'd he say?

956
01:04:19,989 --> 01:04:23,288
What he... He said that I'm...

957
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:26,051
I've developed a brain virus.

958
01:04:28,631 --> 01:04:30,223
You mean, you're sick?

959
01:04:30,466 --> 01:04:32,229
Crazy kind of sick or...

960
01:04:32,902 --> 01:04:35,393
It's more along the lines
of a 24-hour brain virus.

961
01:04:35,471 --> 01:04:39,464
Something that can affect
your brain much the same...

962
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:42,505
Much like diarrhea
of the brain,

963
01:04:42,578 --> 01:04:47,174
in that the gray matter
kind of runs a little bit
and mixes with the other.

964
01:04:47,817 --> 01:04:51,412
It's just a passing thing,
that he said that if I get
a lot of rest

965
01:04:51,954 --> 01:04:54,821
and took a lot of vitamin C,
which I thought strange,

966
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:57,086
but vitamin C is very good,

967
01:04:57,526 --> 01:05:01,053
and the love of a good woman,
he said. And those were
his exact words.

968
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:03,894
I know it sounds like
a John Wayne movie,
but that's...

969
01:05:03,966 --> 01:05:06,093
"The love of a good woman. "

970
01:05:06,168 --> 01:05:07,567
What do we do now?

971
01:05:09,305 --> 01:05:11,535
Well, I guess we could
get married, but I...

972
01:05:11,607 --> 01:05:14,508
I would like to
but I know you
wouldn't wanna do it.

973
01:05:15,878 --> 01:05:17,311
Who says I wouldn't
want to do it?

974
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:20,110
Oh, come on, don't.
Let's just drop it.

975
01:05:20,182 --> 01:05:22,377
Don't grovel.
Well, I gave it a shot.

976
01:05:22,451 --> 01:05:23,611
I gave it a very good shot.

977
01:05:23,686 --> 01:05:25,813
It worked.
It worked?
Where did I get you?

978
01:05:25,888 --> 01:05:28,186
The virus? I was reaching.
Thank you.

979
01:05:38,834 --> 01:05:40,768
Oh, yeah, I'm in love.

980
01:05:42,571 --> 01:05:45,267
Looking good.
You have a very nice ass.

981
01:05:46,909 --> 01:05:48,171
Like I'm gonna bite it!

982
01:05:48,244 --> 01:05:49,973
John, what are you doing?

983
01:05:50,246 --> 01:05:52,237
Don't do this to me, John.

984
01:05:52,848 --> 01:05:56,375
Hey, I'm not gonna do this
to you. You relax me, baby.

985
01:05:56,452 --> 01:05:59,649
You do, you soothe my soul.
Savage soul.

986
01:05:59,722 --> 01:06:01,383
What we have between us
is special.

987
01:06:02,558 --> 01:06:05,493
The magic.
Spin the magic.

988
01:06:05,561 --> 01:06:09,930
It's show time! Yeah!
All right, show time, ladies
and gentlemen. Here we go.

989
01:06:11,734 --> 01:06:12,792
Don't!

990
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:17,603
Did you think
I was gonna do that?

991
01:06:17,673 --> 01:06:19,436
Let's mambo!

992
01:06:25,881 --> 01:06:28,349
Are you all right?
I'm fine. Take a bow.

993
01:06:30,753 --> 01:06:33,119
Yeah, I'm an asshole
and I'm loving it!

994
01:06:35,224 --> 01:06:39,786
Hey, let's mambo! Thank you
very much. Okay, fellas, take
it easy. Take five minutes.

995
01:06:39,862 --> 01:06:43,525
Okay, can we have
a little light here, please?
Thank you very much.

996
01:06:45,034 --> 01:06:48,902
Oh, that feels nice.
That feels...
Doesn't that feel nice? Huh?

997
01:06:48,971 --> 01:06:51,838
It's incredible what light
will do to you. It just
changes the whole mood.

998
01:06:51,907 --> 01:06:56,367
I feel, I feel like singing.
I feel like singing.
I hope you folks don't mind.

999
01:06:57,279 --> 01:07:02,046
This next song is dedicated,
well, to you, honey.
My fiancée.

1000
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:04,653
She's wonderful.
This is her right here.

1001
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:07,689
The one with the blue eyes,
soft blonde hair.

1002
01:07:08,257 --> 01:07:09,622
A wonderful lady.

1003
01:07:09,925 --> 01:07:12,485
The greatest lady in bed
you'll ever wanna meet.

1004
01:07:12,561 --> 01:07:15,724
She's amazing. I mean...
I mean this.

1005
01:07:15,798 --> 01:07:18,289
The things that she can do
with her mouth.

1006
01:07:19,902 --> 01:07:21,802
They're just...
It's incredible.
I mean, she has...

1007
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:23,998
She knows so many
sexual positions.

1008
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:27,234
I'm dumbfounded half the time
and I mean that, honey,
I really do.

1009
01:07:27,309 --> 01:07:30,005
You're incredible.
The best lay I've ever had.

1010
01:07:30,413 --> 01:07:33,541
I mean, I would put her up
against anybody in this room
right now.

1011
01:07:33,616 --> 01:07:36,608
I mean, she'll wear you down.
She'll wear you right down.

1012
01:07:36,685 --> 01:07:38,778
She just grinds,
grinds you to death.

1013
01:07:38,854 --> 01:07:42,255
I mean, she...
You know, all day.
It's all day with her.

1014
01:07:42,324 --> 01:07:44,554
It's just non-stop.
She can't get enough.

1015
01:07:44,627 --> 01:07:46,891
And I respect that
and I love you.

1016
01:07:47,463 --> 01:07:49,624
And this song goes out
to you, honey.

1017
01:07:49,698 --> 01:07:53,190
<i>It's entitled,
Me and My Dick.</i>

1018
01:07:55,504 --> 01:07:58,564
Help me out
'cause this is a special song.

1019
01:07:58,641 --> 01:08:02,543
I'm gonna sing with my dick
in my hand, for you, honey.

1020
01:08:05,481 --> 01:08:07,210
I love you. I mean that.

1021
01:08:07,883 --> 01:08:09,282
Drum roll, please!

1022
01:08:12,188 --> 01:08:14,122
I'm trying
to understand, John.

1023
01:08:14,190 --> 01:08:17,489
I know. I guess it's like
what Dr. Ted said. Somebody
must have put me in a spell

1024
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:20,085
and I've been walking around
in this voodoo-like trance.

1025
01:08:20,162 --> 01:08:22,187
You were definitely
in a trance
at that wedding rehearsal.

1026
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:23,322
I know.

1027
01:08:23,399 --> 01:08:25,333
I don't normally
act that way.

1028
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:27,633
I wanna thank you guys
for sticking with me.

1029
01:08:27,703 --> 01:08:29,830
Hey, anything to get
the old Johnny back, huh?

1030
01:08:29,905 --> 01:08:31,372
I'm gonna get the limo.
I'll meet you on the corner.

1031
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:32,964
Thanks, Chick.
Okay.

1032
01:08:35,311 --> 01:08:37,871
You know, I love you, Nancy.
I know you do.

1033
01:08:38,747 --> 01:08:40,738
Everything's gonna be okay.
Yeah.

1034
01:09:34,570 --> 01:09:37,038
I want you
to open your eyes, John.

1035
01:09:37,106 --> 01:09:40,507
This hypnotism isn't
gonna work. All it does
is make him act like a jerk.

1036
01:09:40,576 --> 01:09:43,044
He's not gonna kill anyone.
Yes, it will work.

1037
01:09:43,112 --> 01:09:46,343
His respect
for the institution of
fatherhood was too strong.

1038
01:09:46,415 --> 01:09:48,076
It caused a mental block.

1039
01:09:48,150 --> 01:09:52,143
Once we destroy that respect,
he'll be exactly what
we want him to be.

1040
01:09:52,821 --> 01:09:55,119
SUN Yl: Who's that imbecile
out there?
That's his friend.

1041
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:58,092
Make him one with the ocean.
Let him sleep with the fishes.

1042
01:09:58,494 --> 01:10:02,658
You know, John, a lot
of bad people are out there
trying to get you.

1043
01:10:03,165 --> 01:10:05,725
Really?
That's why we had
to bring you here.

1044
01:10:05,801 --> 01:10:07,792
We wanted to make sure
you'd be safe.

1045
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:09,565
That's very kind of you.

1046
01:10:09,672 --> 01:10:12,835
One of those bad people
is your future father-in-law,
Ed Reese.

1047
01:10:13,142 --> 01:10:15,736
I'm looking for a John.
My name...
I wonder if you saw him.

1048
01:10:15,811 --> 01:10:21,807
He's about this tall,
light-colored hair,
round face.

1049
01:10:21,884 --> 01:10:25,320
He's got a good nature,
good-natured guy.
He's got a...

1050
01:10:26,622 --> 01:10:30,752
He laughs like that.
I think he's with a couple
of gentlemen.

1051
01:10:30,826 --> 01:10:32,555
Let's go, buster.
And no trouble.

1052
01:10:32,828 --> 01:10:34,955
Fathers are the root
of it all, John.

1053
01:10:35,030 --> 01:10:37,828
I have a great respect
for the institution
of fatherhood.

1054
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:41,631
Do you see?
Fathers are bad, John.

1055
01:10:41,770 --> 01:10:44,068
And they must be stopped
at all costs.

1056
01:10:44,206 --> 01:10:46,470
Think of all the damage
they've done.

1057
01:10:47,142 --> 01:10:50,270
You know, John,
throughout history,

1058
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:54,371
it was the father
who was the cause
of all the trouble.

1059
01:10:59,054 --> 01:11:03,184
<i>Hi, honey, I'm home.
Hello, dear.</i>

1060
01:11:04,693 --> 01:11:07,253
<i>Where's Princess?
Here she is.</i>

1061
01:11:07,563 --> 01:11:09,861
<i>Hi, Dad.
Hi, Princess.</i>

1062
01:11:13,669 --> 01:11:16,001
<i>And where's my Kitten?
She's upstairs.</i>

1063
01:11:16,071 --> 01:11:18,403
<i>Hi, Daddy.
Hi, Kitten.</i>

1064
01:11:19,675 --> 01:11:21,768
<i>Why don't you just
slide down the banister?</i>

1065
01:11:21,844 --> 01:11:24,176
<i>You know Daddy will always
be here to catch you.</i>

1066
01:11:24,246 --> 01:11:25,304
<i>Here I come.</i>

1067
01:11:33,389 --> 01:11:37,086
<i>Another cup, dear?
No, this coffee sucks!</i>

1068
01:11:39,928 --> 01:11:43,022
<i>Maybe it's the caffeine
that makes you so irritable.</i>

1069
01:11:43,899 --> 01:11:47,335
<i>I'm not irritable,
God damn it!
I'm an insurance salesman.</i>

1070
01:11:47,403 --> 01:11:50,338
<i>Insurance salesmen
never get irritable, Margaret.</i>

1071
01:11:50,406 --> 01:11:52,340
<i>Anything you say, dear.</i>

1072
01:11:54,877 --> 01:11:57,243
<i>Where's Bud,
that gearhead son of mine?</i>

1073
01:11:57,813 --> 01:12:00,407
<i>You locked him
in the shed for a week,
don't you remember, dear?</i>

1074
01:12:00,482 --> 01:12:01,847
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

1075
01:12:02,484 --> 01:12:04,850
<i>Hi, Father.
Hi, Princess.</i>

1076
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:10,085
<i>Father, a very nice
young man asked me
to the RO TC ball next Friday.</i>

1077
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:12,354
<i>Can I go?
No.</i>

1078
01:12:12,428 --> 01:12:15,886
<i>But why not?
He's perfectly acceptable.</i>

1079
01:12:15,964 --> 01:12:18,159
<i>And a lot of my friends
are going.</i>

1080
01:12:18,367 --> 01:12:19,800
<i>I said no.</i>

1081
01:12:19,868 --> 01:12:22,166
<i>Friday is punishment night,
Princess.</i>

1082
01:12:22,237 --> 01:12:23,670
<i>Father, I really wanna go.</i>

1083
01:12:23,739 --> 01:12:25,730
<i>Well, maybe you'd like to
talk about this in the den.</i>

1084
01:12:25,808 --> 01:12:27,969
<i>Please, Father.
Oh, let's talk about it,
Princess.</i>

1085
01:12:28,043 --> 01:12:31,740
<i>Please, don't! No!
Let's have a little chat!
Come on, Princess!</i>

1086
01:12:33,515 --> 01:12:35,608
<i>Margaret? You're next.</i>

1087
01:12:36,685 --> 01:12:39,017
<i>Hi, Mrs. Anderson.
Hi, Mr. Anderson.</i>

1088
01:12:39,955 --> 01:12:41,445
<i>Do you think
I could hide out here
for a while?</i>

1089
01:12:41,523 --> 01:12:43,616
<i>Beaver, what's wrong?
You're covered with blood.</i>

1090
01:12:43,692 --> 01:12:45,785
<i>Yeah, I know.
It's Wally's blood.</i>

1091
01:12:45,861 --> 01:12:48,125
<i>See, Wally and I
were fixing his bike
in the driveway</i>

1092
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:49,596
<i>and Dad came home
and got real mad.</i>

1093
01:12:49,665 --> 01:12:51,394
<i>So he took a gun out
and killed Wally.</i>

1094
01:12:51,467 --> 01:12:53,401
<i>Blew his head clean off
his shoulders.</i>

1095
01:12:53,469 --> 01:12:55,903
<i>His face is all over
the garage door,
it's a real mess.</i>

1096
01:12:55,971 --> 01:12:58,269
<i>Well, maybe your dad
knows what he's doing.</i>

1097
01:12:58,340 --> 01:13:02,208
<i>I don't think so.
I think he flipped out.
Margaret, call up Ward.</i>

1098
01:13:02,277 --> 01:13:03,369
<i>Tell him Beaver's here.</i>

1099
01:13:03,445 --> 01:13:05,879
<i>Oh, don't do that,
Mr. Anderson. Please,
Mrs. Anderson, don't do that.</i>

1100
01:13:05,948 --> 01:13:08,246
<i>I think it's time
you had your punishment,
Beaver.</i>

1101
01:13:08,317 --> 01:13:12,083
<i>Oh, no, Mr. Anderson, no! No!</i>

1102
01:13:12,187 --> 01:13:15,623
<i>No! No! No! No!</i>

1103
01:13:15,691 --> 01:13:19,457
No, don't do that
to the Beaver.
You can't do it to Beaver.

1104
01:13:19,828 --> 01:13:24,561
I hate you, Ward!
I hate Jim Anderson!
I hate Ed Reese!

1105
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,062
Good, John.

1106
01:13:27,102 --> 01:13:33,132
Now, when you hear
the Minister say,
"With this ring I thee wed,"

1107
01:13:35,010 --> 01:13:41,472
you will take out your gun,
point it at Ed Reese
and squeeze the trigger.

1108
01:13:48,290 --> 01:13:50,315
It's the father of the bride.

1109
01:13:50,392 --> 01:13:52,326
So nice to see you again,
Congressman.

1110
01:13:52,394 --> 01:13:55,158
Hey, couldn't ask
for nicer weather, huh?

1111
01:13:55,230 --> 01:14:01,169
Listen, we both know why
you're here, you low-life
scumbag, son of a bitch!

1112
01:14:01,470 --> 01:14:03,199
Jim? Good to see you, Jim.

1113
01:14:03,338 --> 01:14:08,071
Just don't press your luck!
Don't ever try to talk
to me again, you hear?

1114
01:14:08,143 --> 01:14:13,274
Hey! That's wonderful.
That's great, what a thing.

1115
01:14:13,348 --> 01:14:15,111
A marvelous sense of humor.

1116
01:14:25,561 --> 01:14:26,994
That's nice and low.
Bobby, get down.

1117
01:14:27,062 --> 01:14:29,690
Let's get the, the majesty
of this damn thing.

1118
01:14:29,932 --> 01:14:34,926
Yeah. Yeah. Just kind of
pan around. That's it.
Just move, move! That's it.

1119
01:14:35,037 --> 01:14:38,996
What are you looking at?
I'm not here! Just do
your thing! It's a wedding.

1120
01:14:39,074 --> 01:14:41,599
Hi. Friends of the bride
on this side, friends of
the groom on this side.

1121
01:14:41,677 --> 01:14:42,735
Groom.

1122
01:14:45,447 --> 01:14:48,314
Don't look at me.
Just keep walking.
That's beautiful.

1123
01:14:48,383 --> 01:14:49,816
Good. Can we
get the black guy?

1124
01:14:49,885 --> 01:14:52,581
Can you get in here,
'cause that's very important
for the Congressman?

1125
01:14:52,654 --> 01:14:54,849
We need some black people
in this. That's nice.

1126
01:14:56,692 --> 01:14:58,853
Hi. So far so good, huh?

1127
01:14:58,927 --> 01:15:01,395
Hold your tongue.
The hardest part
is still to come.

1128
01:15:01,463 --> 01:15:04,296
Where's the leader?
He's around, somewhere,

1129
01:15:04,733 --> 01:15:08,464
watching,
like a cat on the prowl
stalking his prey,

1130
01:15:08,537 --> 01:15:10,334
making every movement count.

1131
01:15:10,405 --> 01:15:11,895
Shouldn't we go?
Yes.

1132
01:15:17,646 --> 01:15:19,079
Keep moving.

1133
01:15:21,984 --> 01:15:23,542
I was a little hungry.

1134
01:15:25,387 --> 01:15:28,515
It's good. It's a good thing
to be hungry. It's allowed.

1135
01:15:29,591 --> 01:15:33,220
I saw Patti.
You did a good job with her.
She looks very fine.

1136
01:15:33,295 --> 01:15:37,925
I hope the spell lasts.
It's been known to wear off
under pressure.

1137
01:15:39,001 --> 01:15:42,835
Negative thoughts.
No negative thoughts.
Circulate.

1138
01:15:43,438 --> 01:15:47,067
That's good, just...
That's good. This is...
That's good.

1139
01:15:47,142 --> 01:15:50,407
This is just no problem,
keep moving. This is
a low angle. That's all right.

1140
01:15:50,479 --> 01:15:52,970
Making a film.
Oh, this is beautiful.

1141
01:15:53,048 --> 01:15:55,073
This is great.
Just keep walking up.

1142
01:15:55,150 --> 01:15:59,052
That's fine. That's good.
Making magic down here.
It looks fabulous.

1143
01:16:43,298 --> 01:16:46,062
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today...

1144
01:16:46,134 --> 01:16:47,362
Action!

1145
01:16:49,738 --> 01:16:53,469
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today
to join John...

1146
01:16:53,542 --> 01:16:56,875
In a matter of moments
a union will take place

1147
01:16:56,945 --> 01:16:59,345
within these hallowed walls.

1148
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:03,714
A union between
a man and a woman,

1149
01:17:04,753 --> 01:17:07,244
who just happens
to be the daughter of a guy

1150
01:17:07,322 --> 01:17:10,587
that could be
the next President
of the United States.

1151
01:17:11,526 --> 01:17:15,656
I'm Sal Di Pasquale,
and this is my film.

1152
01:17:15,731 --> 01:17:16,857
With this ring...

1153
01:17:16,932 --> 01:17:18,661
John and Nancy.

1154
01:17:18,867 --> 01:17:20,232
...I thee wed.

1155
01:17:20,502 --> 01:17:21,867
The wedding.

1156
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:28,837
Okay, Bobby,
you can zoom in now.

1157
01:17:29,978 --> 01:17:33,072
That was great, Mr. Di...
Get out of the way!

1158
01:17:37,285 --> 01:17:39,014
And now, John, your vows?

1159
01:17:42,424 --> 01:17:43,482
John?

1160
01:17:46,261 --> 01:17:50,527
Well, I guess Nancy's vows
will suffice for both.

1161
01:17:50,599 --> 01:17:53,067
And now we'll continue
with the ceremony.

1162
01:17:53,402 --> 01:17:56,860
If anyone here
knows of any reason

1163
01:17:56,938 --> 01:18:00,499
why this couple should not
be bound in holy matrimony,

1164
01:18:01,209 --> 01:18:04,201
let him speak now
or forever hold his peace.

1165
01:18:10,986 --> 01:18:14,581
Do you,
Nancy Wilhelmina Reese...

1166
01:18:27,235 --> 01:18:31,137
Do you, Nancy Wilhelmina Reese

1167
01:18:32,841 --> 01:18:36,106
take this man,
John Franklin Bourgignon,

1168
01:18:36,178 --> 01:18:38,578
to be your lawful
wedded husband,

1169
01:18:39,114 --> 01:18:43,244
to have and to hold,
in sickness and in health,

1170
01:18:44,419 --> 01:18:46,080
from this day forward?

1171
01:18:46,788 --> 01:18:47,846
I do.

1172
01:18:48,190 --> 01:18:51,648
Do you,
John Franklin Bourgignon,

1173
01:18:52,327 --> 01:18:58,027
take this woman,
Nancy Wilhelmina Reese,
to be your lawful wedded wife,

1174
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:01,160
to have and to hold,
in sickness and in health,

1175
01:19:02,370 --> 01:19:04,634
from this day forward?

1176
01:19:06,308 --> 01:19:07,297
Yeah.

1177
01:19:13,849 --> 01:19:17,512
With this ring, I thee wed.

1178
01:19:28,663 --> 01:19:31,860
Chick, it's all right,
I know what I'm doing!
Sal, stop those guys!

1179
01:19:32,634 --> 01:19:35,432
Block the aisle!
Get out of the way!

1180
01:19:37,372 --> 01:19:38,964
We're in a church.

1181
01:19:39,941 --> 01:19:42,341
Chick, are you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
How about you?

1182
01:19:42,410 --> 01:19:45,811
I'm not hypnotized. Look,
those cultists, they wanted
me to kill Ed Reese.

1183
01:19:45,881 --> 01:19:47,576
Yeah, I know.
Look, what happened?

1184
01:19:47,649 --> 01:19:50,584
<i>They made me watch
some phony
Father Knows Best film.</i>

1185
01:19:50,685 --> 01:19:53,518
I know TV.
Jim Anderson would
never choke the Beaver.

1186
01:19:53,588 --> 01:19:54,680
Johnny?

1187
01:19:54,890 --> 01:19:57,120
Oh, are you all right, Nance?
Didn't you just save
daddy's life?

1188
01:19:57,192 --> 01:20:00,127
Will somebody please tell me
what's going on?

1189
01:20:00,195 --> 01:20:02,823
Daddy, Johnny just
saved your life.

1190
01:20:04,499 --> 01:20:06,160
Dad, you owe me one.

1191
01:20:06,968 --> 01:20:09,061
Oh, my God!

1192
01:20:27,455 --> 01:20:29,548
Well, was I right
or was I right?

1193
01:20:29,624 --> 01:20:33,060
I told you this was
gonna be an incredible story,
and it was.

1194
01:20:33,128 --> 01:20:36,620
Can you believe
the way things work out?
Sal and Ed Reese are partners?

1195
01:20:36,698 --> 01:20:38,325
No!

1196
01:20:38,867 --> 01:20:41,802
All right, it's a hot day
out here, let's get it right
the first time, all right?

1197
01:20:41,870 --> 01:20:46,307
We can go home,
it's history. Ready?
One, two, three, four.

1198
01:20:53,148 --> 01:20:57,175
Loosen up! That's it. Smile.
Don't be afraid to smile.

1199
01:21:19,241 --> 01:21:21,232
You need to go with it.

1200
01:21:27,716 --> 01:21:29,911
Well, I'll tell you one thing,
I'm happy to have you here.

1201
01:21:29,985 --> 01:21:34,012
You know, hey, man, you know,
you ought to try some skin
softener or something, man.

1202
01:21:34,089 --> 01:21:36,683
That stuff look real hard.
You ought to take care of it.

1203
01:21:36,758 --> 01:21:38,555
One thing I wanna talk
to you about, though.

1204
01:21:38,627 --> 01:21:42,757
Now that the noodle factory
is a success, and after all,
I am the pasta king,

1205
01:21:42,831 --> 01:21:44,822
I think we ought
to try and diversify.

1206
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:48,461
What I think we ought to do
is get into animal noodles.

1207
01:21:48,536 --> 01:21:51,471
We ought to make
little dog noodles
and little cat noodles.

1208
01:21:51,539 --> 01:21:55,202
We should get little lion
and little tiger noodles,
you know? Elephant noodles.

1209
01:21:55,277 --> 01:21:58,508
The kids will love it.
They'll eat it up.
And that's my plan, you see,

1210
01:21:58,580 --> 01:22:00,844
I'll get all the kids
going into the supermarkets

1211
01:22:00,916 --> 01:22:03,441
and they'll be buying
Wallissimo Jefferson noodles

1212
01:22:03,518 --> 01:22:04,644
and we will make a fortune.

1213
01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:07,745
Which reminds me,
guess who I saw on 33rd
and 3rd the other day?

1214
01:22:07,822 --> 01:22:11,815
Lefkowitz.
You remember Lefkowitz,
he a lawyer now.

1215
01:22:11,893 --> 01:22:16,489
Did it at home, too.
Correspondence course.
That boy was always smart.

1216
01:22:16,564 --> 01:22:19,499
He handles all
my affairs for me now.
Takes care of me legally.

1217
01:22:19,567 --> 01:22:21,501
As a matter of fact,
I don't mind saying

1218
01:22:21,569 --> 01:22:25,505
Lefkowitz is directly
responsible for the condition
I'm in today.

1219
01:22:26,441 --> 01:22:29,001
Two weeks ago we did my will.
I wanna show it to you.
I got it right here.

1220
01:22:29,077 --> 01:22:32,513
He told me to keep it
with me at all times.
You know like, just in case.

1221
01:22:32,580 --> 01:22:35,140
Here let me read this to you.
See, it say right here,

1222
01:22:35,216 --> 01:22:40,119
"I, Wallace A. Jefferson,
being of sound mind,
spent all my money. "

1223
01:22:43,024 --> 01:22:45,686
Ain't that good?
Wait till I die
and they read that.

1224
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:47,421
That's wonderful.

1225
01:22:48,463 --> 01:22:51,432
Another thing I wanted
to talk to you about
is about my new idea.

1226
01:22:51,499 --> 01:22:53,933
<i>I call it
Raiders of the Burning Bush.</i>

1227
01:22:54,202 --> 01:22:57,035
You see, all we have
to do is find the spot

1228
01:22:57,105 --> 01:22:59,039
where the original
burning bush went down

1229
01:22:59,107 --> 01:23:01,302
and then we sell tickets
so people can go see it.

1230
01:23:01,376 --> 01:23:04,140
It's kind of like
the Lost Ark, especially what
we're gonna do with it, see.

1231
01:23:04,212 --> 01:23:05,941
Well, I think more people
would wanna see the spot

1232
01:23:06,014 --> 01:23:07,447
where the burning bush
went down.

1233
01:23:07,515 --> 01:23:09,779
Now, I know you might think
it sounds kind of far-fetched.

1234
01:23:09,851 --> 01:23:12,376
I know a lot of people
probably been looking for it
and everything,

1235
01:23:12,454 --> 01:23:14,922
but it's hard to find
because the bush burned down.

1236
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:17,618
You and me, Muhammed.
I think we can do it.

1237
01:23:17,692 --> 01:23:20,024
And I bet you we could
make a fortune, too.

1238
01:23:20,095 --> 01:23:22,120
I know we can make enough
to buy me a new convertible,

1239
01:23:22,197 --> 01:23:25,189
after that dude stole it
from the noodle factory.

1240
01:23:25,266 --> 01:23:26,392
You hired the cat.

1241
01:23:26,468 --> 01:23:28,402
And don't,
don't go pretending
like you didn't hire him

1242
01:23:28,470 --> 01:23:30,062
because when he came
and asked for the job,

1243
01:23:30,138 --> 01:23:32,504
I turned to you and I said,
"Should we hire him or not?"

1244
01:23:32,574 --> 01:23:34,667
And I gave you the nudge
and you gave him the nod.

1245
01:23:34,743 --> 01:23:37,871
So you did hire the cat.
And you... I never brought
this up before.

1246
01:23:37,946 --> 01:23:40,005
But I'm bringing it up now
simply because it's gone.

1247
01:23:40,081 --> 01:23:42,606
<i>So either you
go in with me on this
Raiders of the Burning Bush,</i>

1248
01:23:42,684 --> 01:23:45,915
or I'm gonna have to
reconsider our partnership,
Muhammed.

1249
01:23:47,389 --> 01:23:50,825
That's enough for you
to drink, you know. Hey, look
here, I'm buying you a drink,

1250
01:23:50,892 --> 01:23:53,383
you sit there,
you eat, you waste it.
Come on, Muhammed.

1251
01:23:53,461 --> 01:23:55,656
That's all right,
leave it there,
I'll drink it myself.

1252
01:23:55,730 --> 01:23:58,665
The only trouble is,
every time I drink one
then I got to go again.

1253
01:23:58,733 --> 01:24:02,692
You never have to go. I mean,
I have two or three
and I'm off to the john.

1254
01:24:02,771 --> 01:24:05,365
Used to be a time
when I could hold
a whole case.

1255
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:08,898
Now I have two
or three drinks, boom,
I got to go.

1256
01:24:08,977 --> 01:24:10,808
Guess I must be getting older.

1257
01:24:10,879 --> 01:24:13,370
Ain't nothing I can do
about it. I mean,
you can't stop time.

1258
01:24:13,448 --> 01:24:15,348
I mean, you see time
walking down the street.

1259
01:24:15,417 --> 01:24:18,045
You say, "Hey, Time, hold it.
I wanna rap to you. "

1260
01:24:18,119 --> 01:24:20,644
Time ain't gonna stop for you.
Time waits for no man.

1261
01:24:20,722 --> 01:24:23,282
Time will tell you,
"Sorry, I got to march on. "
