1
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,583
Curtain-up in 5 minutes.

2
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,833
On stage, please.

3
00:01:45,334 --> 00:01:47,166
- Break a leg.
- I will.

4
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,499
ME MYSELF AND MUM

5
00:03:09,167 --> 00:03:10,666
Mum?

6
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,958
- Yes, what?
- I have a little headache.

7
00:03:25,167 --> 00:03:26,374
Me too.

8
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:34,041
I bumped into my very
first sweetheart. Remember Anna?

9
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:36,458
Oh yeah... How is he?

10
00:03:40,167 --> 00:03:42,041
Just fine, I think.

11
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:07,916
What now?

12
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:11,499
I love when you speak Spanish.
You're pretty when you...

13
00:04:11,667 --> 00:04:15,666
You're always pretty,
but even prettier in Spanish.

14
00:04:15,834 --> 00:04:19,291
Even prettier than Dad's secretaries.

15
00:04:23,917 --> 00:04:26,541
I'd like to speak Spanish too.

16
00:04:26,709 --> 00:04:30,208
Can I do a language study holiday
in Spain?

17
00:04:30,834 --> 00:04:34,291
Sure. Dad's taking the boys
to the Grand Canyon.

18
00:04:34,459 --> 00:04:37,749
I doubt you'd like that.
So why not Spain?

19
00:04:37,917 --> 00:04:39,124
- Really?
- Yes.

20
00:04:39,334 --> 00:04:43,624
They've gone sailing in Australia,
horse-riding in Kenya...

21
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:48,999
Dad and the boys are athletic,
not you. What do you expect?

22
00:04:49,167 --> 00:04:51,541
You hate horses and get seasick.

23
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:54,624
Don't blame Dad.
You're not athletic.

24
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:59,374
Don't worry...
I'll find you something in Spain.

25
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,833
Something really nice.

26
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,999
Something really nice...

27
00:05:04,292 --> 00:05:06,708
She went all out to find it.

28
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:10,041
I end up in the ugliest city
in Spain.

29
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:12,208
La Linea de la Concepción.

30
00:05:17,334 --> 00:05:19,416
Projects outside of Gibraltar.

31
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,541
Like Le Havre, but uglier.

32
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:23,833
Yes, it's possible.

33
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:35,041
Simple, but tasteful.

34
00:05:48,584 --> 00:05:50,333
You're very lucky.

35
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:54,958
The unica familia in the city
that doesn't take la droga.

36
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:56,333
Take what?

37
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,916
La droga.

38
00:06:01,834 --> 00:06:03,374
Well, that's...

39
00:06:03,542 --> 00:06:06,291
How do you say
"That's great" in Spanish?

40
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:15,624
Good.

41
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:22,291
There I meet Paqui.

42
00:06:24,042 --> 00:06:26,291
Not one word of French.

43
00:07:08,584 --> 00:07:10,874
"Casa" and "blanca", that's all.

44
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,041
I brought her a Julio Iglesias album.

45
00:07:19,209 --> 00:07:20,499
But in French.

46
00:08:35,917 --> 00:08:38,666
In short, in 3 weeks is la feria.

47
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:42,333
Learn the Sevillana
or you'll be bored stiff.

48
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,083
She'll teach you how to dance it.

49
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:33,666
8 hours a day for 3 weeks.

50
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,749
Even at the beach with her friends.

51
00:09:45,834 --> 00:09:47,291
When the feria began,

52
00:09:47,709 --> 00:09:50,416
I danced almost as well as Paqui.

53
00:09:50,584 --> 00:09:53,041
Along with my entire Spanish family,

54
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,708
we went to hear
the best Sevillana group

55
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:58,624
in the whole feria.

56
00:10:18,209 --> 00:10:21,208
There I am,
amid those Andalusian dresses,

57
00:10:21,417 --> 00:10:23,333
dancing the Sevillana.

58
00:10:29,834 --> 00:10:32,708
That girl seems to want to laugh.

59
00:10:34,584 --> 00:10:36,666
Everyone around us, too.

60
00:10:38,709 --> 00:10:39,916
It's rare to see

61
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:42,541
a Frenchman dance the Sevillana
so well!

62
00:10:45,334 --> 00:10:48,999
But why do they laugh so much
at the third pass?

63
00:10:49,167 --> 00:10:51,083
When I lift my knee,

64
00:10:51,292 --> 00:10:52,791
they all went....

65
00:10:58,292 --> 00:11:01,499
Anyway,
they had me dancing all night,

66
00:11:01,667 --> 00:11:03,666
so impressed were they.

67
00:11:26,709 --> 00:11:28,708
Paqui, come dance with me!

68
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:32,541
He's being a pain
and my legs are killing me.

69
00:11:32,709 --> 00:11:33,624
Please!

70
00:11:33,792 --> 00:11:35,416
Go ask Pilar.

71
00:11:35,584 --> 00:11:37,249
- For me?
- Yes!

72
00:11:37,417 --> 00:11:38,624
Thanks.

73
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:45,916
Will you dance with me, please?

74
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,249
I'm sorry.

75
00:11:47,417 --> 00:11:51,166
I dance the Sevillana
with boys, not girls.

76
00:11:52,667 --> 00:11:53,958
What do you mean?

77
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,166
You dance like a girl.

78
00:11:57,584 --> 00:11:59,749
Don't move your hands like this.

79
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:01,624
Never. It's for girls.

80
00:12:01,792 --> 00:12:02,624
Because...

81
00:12:03,584 --> 00:12:06,999
I was copying Paqui.
She said take an apple,

82
00:12:07,209 --> 00:12:08,041
eat it, toss it...

83
00:12:08,209 --> 00:12:10,166
It's only for girls.

84
00:12:10,584 --> 00:12:13,749
In the third pass,
when you lift your knee,

85
00:12:13,917 --> 00:12:16,208
girls do it
to lift their dresses.

86
00:12:16,417 --> 00:12:17,999
You have no dress.

87
00:12:20,792 --> 00:12:24,166
Now I understand
why they were all laughing...

88
00:12:26,542 --> 00:12:29,541
Tell me something, Pilar...

89
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,749
Do I really dance like a girl?
Honestly...

90
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:36,291
do I really look like a girl?

91
00:12:39,834 --> 00:12:41,499
Thank you, Pilar.

92
00:12:41,667 --> 00:12:44,874
You can't imagine
how happy Mum will be!

93
00:12:45,459 --> 00:12:47,749
- Boys and Guillaume, lunch!
- Coming.

94
00:12:47,917 --> 00:12:49,666
Mum says it's lunchtime.

95
00:12:49,834 --> 00:12:50,666
Shut up!

96
00:12:50,834 --> 00:12:53,874
She said,
"The boys and Guillaume, lunch!"

97
00:12:54,042 --> 00:12:55,999
She said it's lunchtime.

98
00:12:56,167 --> 00:12:59,458
Hurry up or you'll get a spanking.

99
00:13:02,709 --> 00:13:04,416
You'll get the spanking!

100
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:06,791
Not me.

101
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,166
Mum and I love each other
more than anyone.

102
00:13:33,292 --> 00:13:35,416
Isn't our love the biggest?

103
00:13:35,584 --> 00:13:39,666
Sit down, you three.
I'm sick and tired of this!

104
00:13:44,042 --> 00:13:45,458
My mother is reserved.

105
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,374
She doesn't gush.

106
00:13:49,334 --> 00:13:51,124
My mother's amazing.

107
00:13:51,792 --> 00:13:55,041
I don't think
my mother has any flaws.

108
00:13:55,792 --> 00:13:58,916
Except being in bad mood since...

109
00:14:00,792 --> 00:14:02,874
...ever since I was born.

110
00:14:03,917 --> 00:14:06,458
Is her bad mood because of me?

111
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,749
When she answers the phone,

112
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,124
she always sounds annoyed,
like this.

113
00:14:16,417 --> 00:14:20,041
Since she does nothing all day,
by sounding annoyed,

114
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,374
people think she's busy.

115
00:14:22,542 --> 00:14:24,333
As if she does something.

116
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,874
Pretty smart, isn't it?

117
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,708
Constantly oscillating

118
00:14:31,917 --> 00:14:33,791
between extreme heat...

119
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:35,874
and bitter cold.

120
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:39,249
With no transition
from one to the other.

121
00:14:39,417 --> 00:14:40,833
For example, the other day

122
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,374
she was sitting down,
saying "Finally no lunch guests!"

123
00:14:45,542 --> 00:14:48,041
Sick and tired of having company.

124
00:14:48,209 --> 00:14:51,666
No sooner did she say it,
than the cook came

125
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:54,416
to announce that Lucien's parents,

126
00:14:54,584 --> 00:14:56,624
my brother's classmate's...

127
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,249
They're in the kitchen.

128
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:01,916
What the hell for?

129
00:15:02,209 --> 00:15:04,416
Monsieur asked them to lunch.

130
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:06,666
Shit.

131
00:15:06,834 --> 00:15:08,374
Pain in the ass...

132
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,583
Show them in.
Don't leave them there!

133
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,291
Never a moment's rest.

134
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,458
All the livelong day...

135
00:15:16,209 --> 00:15:17,458
How are you doing?

136
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:20,833
Lovely to see you.
It's been ages.

137
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,541
Please... have a seat...

138
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,249
Something to drink?

139
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:33,999
Something to drink?

140
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:38,291
Something to drink?

141
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,333
- Perrier.
- Decaf.

142
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,416
Say it!
3 hours for decaf and Perrier!

143
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:45,666
Spare us.
Get a decaf and a Perrier.

144
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,999
Tell everyone it's lunchtime.

145
00:15:52,542 --> 00:15:55,541
It's so hot, my dears. Unbearable.

146
00:15:57,334 --> 00:15:58,249
Say it!

147
00:15:58,417 --> 00:16:01,333
Three hours for decaf and a Perrier.

148
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,333
Spare us...

149
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,333
I imitate her really well.

150
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,499
Her gestures, intonations.
It's great.

151
00:16:10,667 --> 00:16:12,124
I'm so good at it,

152
00:16:12,334 --> 00:16:16,749
I can call the cook
and she thinks it's my mother.

153
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,874
- Hello, Maria.
-Yes, ma'am.

154
00:16:20,334 --> 00:16:22,041
What are they eating today?

155
00:16:22,209 --> 00:16:24,291
Liver, like every Thursday.

156
00:16:26,917 --> 00:16:28,999
Make them sole instead.

157
00:16:29,209 --> 00:16:32,458
The boys love it
and Guillaume needs fish.

158
00:16:32,917 --> 00:16:34,708
Yes, madam...

159
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,083
Thank you, Maria.

160
00:16:39,834 --> 00:16:42,291
Even my grandmother falls for it.

161
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:51,708
I'll make more.

162
00:16:56,042 --> 00:16:57,833
With all this tea

163
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,666
my bladder is filled to the rim.

164
00:17:18,334 --> 00:17:22,333
We've discussed everything
and nothing. Mostly nothing.

165
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:24,833
So how are you?

166
00:17:25,667 --> 00:17:27,541
I have a little headache.

167
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:33,874
And how are the boys?

168
00:17:34,084 --> 00:17:35,291
Fine.

169
00:17:35,792 --> 00:17:36,958
And Guillaume?

170
00:17:38,459 --> 00:17:40,249
I have a little headache.

171
00:17:40,417 --> 00:17:42,499
You said so. Take an aspirin.

172
00:17:42,709 --> 00:17:44,374
But how is Guillaume?

173
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:47,624
Besides my head, I'm fine.

174
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,708
What do you mean?

175
00:17:51,417 --> 00:17:52,583
It's you, honey?

176
00:17:52,792 --> 00:17:54,541
Yes it's me, Babou.

177
00:17:54,709 --> 00:17:56,749
- Mum's not here?
- Bathroom.

178
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:57,916
Bathroom...

179
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,916
Washing her hands.

180
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:01,458
Bathroom...

181
00:18:02,542 --> 00:18:04,583
She's washing her hands.

182
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,916
Know why you mixed us up?
We look alike.

183
00:18:08,084 --> 00:18:09,541
And you know why?

184
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,916
Listen to me, sweetie.

185
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:15,374
Never complain,
never lie to yourself.

186
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,541
Don't ever disavow.

187
00:18:18,709 --> 00:18:20,583
Or make false claims.

188
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,916
And never justify yourself.

189
00:18:23,084 --> 00:18:24,874
- Is that clear?
- Very.

190
00:18:25,042 --> 00:18:26,249
It's not what I meant.

191
00:18:26,417 --> 00:18:27,749
If I'm like Mum...

192
00:18:27,917 --> 00:18:29,499
Later, later...

193
00:18:30,667 --> 00:18:34,249
Think over what I just told you,
my angel.

194
00:18:38,292 --> 00:18:41,749
Well, my dears...
it was Niagara Falls.

195
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:47,999
Everyone falls for it.

196
00:18:48,209 --> 00:18:51,833
The only one
who never falls for it...

197
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,333
is Dad.

198
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,208
He doesn't want me to be a girl.

199
00:19:00,709 --> 00:19:01,958
Not at all.

200
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,916
I feel bad for Mum.

201
00:19:14,167 --> 00:19:17,083
He's why she buys me boys clothes.

202
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,041
So he won't get upset.

203
00:19:19,709 --> 00:19:21,666
Getting dressed is tough,

204
00:19:21,834 --> 00:19:25,208
but dressing as a girl
with boys clothes...

205
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,624
So I improvise.

206
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,708
Hello, godfather...

207
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,749
Dressing as a Papuan now?

208
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,833
Just my father.

209
00:20:22,542 --> 00:20:23,791
Perfect.

210
00:20:24,459 --> 00:20:25,874
Thank you, Marc.

211
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:28,291
Our turn.

212
00:20:28,459 --> 00:20:29,999
Shall we straighten it?

213
00:20:32,542 --> 00:20:34,666
I try to look like her,

214
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,499
so he understands.

215
00:20:37,042 --> 00:20:38,916
No... nothing doing.

216
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:54,249
What sport do you want to do?

217
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,999
You're flunking gym class.

218
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,708
I want you playing sports
every Saturday.

219
00:21:09,542 --> 00:21:12,083
So what sport do you want to do?

220
00:21:14,542 --> 00:21:15,958
How about soccer?

221
00:21:20,792 --> 00:21:23,083
Track, boxing, judo?

222
00:21:25,709 --> 00:21:26,791
Greco-Roman wrestling?

223
00:21:30,167 --> 00:21:30,999
Piano?

224
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:36,874
He wants me to do boy stuff.

225
00:21:38,084 --> 00:21:39,291
The other night,

226
00:21:39,459 --> 00:21:44,208
I was in my room
playing Sissi and Archduchess Sophie.

227
00:21:44,584 --> 00:21:47,208
Archduchess Sophie is gorgeous.

228
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:48,416
So strict.

229
00:21:49,417 --> 00:21:53,583
A bit severe, harsh at times...
but so elegant!

230
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,499
Such a sense of duty!

231
00:21:55,667 --> 00:21:57,916
She suffered, too...
Anyway.

232
00:21:58,209 --> 00:22:00,166
I was in Sissi's anteroom.

233
00:22:00,542 --> 00:22:02,166
In a private audience.

234
00:22:03,209 --> 00:22:05,291
Child, I must speak to you.

235
00:22:05,459 --> 00:22:07,624
Countess Esterhazy, leave us.

236
00:22:22,209 --> 00:22:24,333
Come, let me examine you.

237
00:22:29,917 --> 00:22:31,833
You look sickly.

238
00:22:32,042 --> 00:22:33,708
You are pale and green.

239
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:35,208
Go outside, ride.

240
00:22:36,167 --> 00:22:39,833
Mother, I must leave the court.
Too much etiquette.

241
00:22:40,084 --> 00:22:42,166
I need love and tenderness.

242
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:43,666
Enough self-pity!

243
00:22:43,959 --> 00:22:46,333
An Empress needs no tenderness.

244
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:51,041
Such insolent language.

245
00:22:51,792 --> 00:22:52,624
Mother!

246
00:22:52,834 --> 00:22:54,749
Do not interrupt me.

247
00:22:55,750 --> 00:23:00,083
The Austrian court's strict etiquette
comes from Spain.

248
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:04,416
Charles V's Imperial style.
There is no escaping it.

249
00:23:07,125 --> 00:23:09,333
I am in a private audience, dammit!

250
00:23:09,625 --> 00:23:11,916
Papili, take me to the forest.

251
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,874
What are you doing?

252
00:23:15,667 --> 00:23:16,791
What's that?

253
00:23:17,167 --> 00:23:18,499
What...

254
00:23:18,917 --> 00:23:19,749
this?

255
00:23:20,542 --> 00:23:21,874
Yes, that.

256
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,249
This is...

257
00:23:27,459 --> 00:23:31,166
At night when I sleep
my comforter falls off

258
00:23:31,334 --> 00:23:34,541
so I thought if I tied it
with my belt,

259
00:23:34,709 --> 00:23:37,333
I wouldn't lose it.

260
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,333
Understand?

261
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,874
And the sweater on your head?

262
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:50,333
So my ears don't get cold.
No, my head.

263
00:23:50,542 --> 00:23:52,499
At night when I sleep.

264
00:23:57,667 --> 00:24:01,333
Put on some pajamas.
I'll turn up the heat.

265
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,249
Thanks!

266
00:24:14,042 --> 00:24:16,333
Now it's boiling in here.

267
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:18,333
A real sauna.

268
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:21,583
He wasn't thrilled with Sissi.

269
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:26,499
So not thrilled,
I was sent to boys boarding school.

270
00:24:26,667 --> 00:24:28,749
The Institute of Christian Brothers.

271
00:24:33,542 --> 00:24:36,499
Happy birthday Guillaume,
biggest fag.

272
00:24:36,667 --> 00:24:38,208
Hurry up!

273
00:24:40,167 --> 00:24:41,374
Come on!

274
00:24:46,334 --> 00:24:47,416
Ready...

275
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:51,208
Lights out!

276
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,874
That noise in the dorm.

277
00:24:59,834 --> 00:25:03,833
And I could see my neighbor.
Thomas or Stephan.

278
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,333
The way he went about it was odd.

279
00:25:08,209 --> 00:25:10,041
Pity the poor girl.

280
00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:13,041
Just the idea of being the mattress!

281
00:25:14,542 --> 00:25:19,041
As I was told later,
close your eyes and think of England.

282
00:25:21,792 --> 00:25:26,374
It felt more like a Turkish prison
than a cricket field.

283
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,791
One night I had tachycardia

284
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,833
and they all gave me a heart massage.

285
00:25:34,042 --> 00:25:35,749
119 boys on me.

286
00:25:35,959 --> 00:25:37,249
I thought I'd die.

287
00:25:37,917 --> 00:25:39,583
So faggot, sick again?

288
00:25:40,375 --> 00:25:42,541
You fake it, don't you? Fag!

289
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:44,124
The monitor!

290
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:45,458
Hurry up!

291
00:25:50,417 --> 00:25:51,958
There's no one.

292
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,499
Really?

293
00:25:55,167 --> 00:25:56,124
My one friend,

294
00:25:56,334 --> 00:25:59,041
son of a farmer from Picardy.
Nicolas.

295
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,749
See how they freaked out?

296
00:26:04,709 --> 00:26:06,499
Like little rats, man!

297
00:26:07,584 --> 00:26:08,499
Okay, good night.

298
00:26:15,834 --> 00:26:17,291
It's ice cold in here.

299
00:26:36,875 --> 00:26:40,083
Two years of hazing
never killed anyone.

300
00:26:44,334 --> 00:26:46,416
Dad says you're a crybaby.

301
00:26:47,667 --> 00:26:50,041
Speaking of Dad... here.

302
00:26:51,125 --> 00:26:52,416
For him.

303
00:26:53,417 --> 00:26:56,041
Not just insults?
He's in a lousy mood.

304
00:27:02,792 --> 00:27:04,416
He read my letter.

305
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,833
Two rats eating each other.

306
00:27:09,459 --> 00:27:12,249
Most people see a butterfly.

307
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:18,958
Put down butterfly then.

308
00:27:22,375 --> 00:27:24,499
I never got the test results.

309
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,833
Mum...
what did the psychiatrists say?

310
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,666
You're a narcissist
and a drama queen. What else?

311
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,624
By the way,

312
00:27:36,875 --> 00:27:38,416
forget Picardy this weekend.

313
00:27:38,584 --> 00:27:39,791
New school.

314
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,416
A new boarding school?

315
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,499
- It's midyear.
- It's decided.

316
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,708
If it's decided...

317
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,999
- But Nicolas...
- Stop.

318
00:27:57,459 --> 00:28:00,833
I have no desire
to go to a boarding school

319
00:28:01,042 --> 00:28:03,458
in the boondocks of England...

320
00:28:03,625 --> 00:28:05,749
In England?

321
00:28:05,917 --> 00:28:07,458
My new school...

322
00:28:08,709 --> 00:28:10,083
It's in England?

323
00:28:11,917 --> 00:28:13,499
In England.

324
00:28:16,292 --> 00:28:18,249
England...

325
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,666
England...

326
00:28:24,375 --> 00:28:27,416
I discovered England.

327
00:28:34,084 --> 00:28:37,624
Where you can walk
with a pumpkin on your head...

328
00:28:39,375 --> 00:28:42,708
...or turkeys on a leash,
with no remarks

329
00:28:42,917 --> 00:28:43,749
besides...

330
00:28:54,417 --> 00:28:58,208
Where every discomfort
gets an encouraging...

331
00:28:59,667 --> 00:29:02,249
Yes, the English look unhealthy

332
00:29:02,792 --> 00:29:04,874
but it's such a pleasure.

333
00:29:09,292 --> 00:29:12,624
Where instead of coffee
you're always offered...

334
00:29:24,625 --> 00:29:26,083
It was wonderful.

335
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:30,291
Goodbye Turkish prison,
hello cricket field.

336
00:29:45,625 --> 00:29:48,083
Besides cricket, it was great.

337
00:29:54,625 --> 00:29:57,041
And that's where I met Jeremy.

338
00:30:14,334 --> 00:30:17,249
Besides cricket and rowing,
it was great.

339
00:30:32,459 --> 00:30:36,083
Besides cricket, rowing and rugby,
it was great.

340
00:30:39,834 --> 00:30:41,291
What's up, friend?

341
00:30:47,334 --> 00:30:49,708
What will horse-riding be like?

342
00:31:41,459 --> 00:31:43,249
Is it pretty here?

343
00:31:44,042 --> 00:31:45,083
Very pretty.

344
00:31:49,459 --> 00:31:50,999
No, that's horrific.

345
00:31:51,417 --> 00:31:52,458
Come on!

346
00:31:54,667 --> 00:31:56,083
Melitta, godammit!

347
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:00,374
They drive me crazy.

348
00:32:01,042 --> 00:32:02,708
Such constant pains!

349
00:32:02,875 --> 00:32:04,999
Back to the kitchen!

350
00:32:05,167 --> 00:32:07,166
Enough! Dirt everywhere!

351
00:32:07,334 --> 00:32:11,458
Foie-gras, toast, white wine,
whatever they want.

352
00:32:25,542 --> 00:32:27,041
Take your pill?

353
00:32:27,209 --> 00:32:28,458
What pill?

354
00:32:28,917 --> 00:32:30,541
You don't have 100.

355
00:32:31,792 --> 00:32:34,416
Sorry but what pill do you mean?

356
00:32:34,584 --> 00:32:36,541
Your pill...

357
00:32:37,084 --> 00:32:38,166
It's you?

358
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:41,833
Yes, it's me.

359
00:32:43,125 --> 00:32:43,999
Night, Dad.

360
00:32:49,459 --> 00:32:52,666
That face,
when he saw it was me, not Mum.

361
00:32:54,167 --> 00:32:57,791
I saw in his eyes
he understood I was a girl.

362
00:33:00,584 --> 00:33:02,708
Finally, Dad understands!

363
00:33:02,875 --> 00:33:05,708
Scram, old chap.
You're on my pillow.

364
00:33:05,875 --> 00:33:07,833
I don't need your farts.

365
00:33:08,042 --> 00:33:09,666
Go to sleep. Enough!

366
00:33:11,375 --> 00:33:13,041
Okay then, goodnight.

367
00:33:13,292 --> 00:33:14,791
Right. Goodnight.

368
00:33:17,875 --> 00:33:19,249
The door.

369
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,999
Thank you.

370
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,416
Why isn't my mother happy?

371
00:33:48,709 --> 00:33:51,208
At last I'm a girl, like her...

372
00:33:53,542 --> 00:33:55,208
How silly of me!

373
00:33:56,334 --> 00:33:58,583
I look too much like her.

374
00:33:59,584 --> 00:34:03,041
Of course, I should imitate
women other than her.

375
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:08,374
The women I like will inspire me.

376
00:34:09,042 --> 00:34:10,666
I adore my grandmother.

377
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:15,749
Bubbles for globules, honey!

378
00:34:24,542 --> 00:34:28,458
The only problem is that
she gets her words wrong.

379
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:30,999
So?

380
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:34,458
Singing along, my bimbette?

381
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:39,958
I'm fine. And you, Babou?

382
00:34:42,042 --> 00:34:44,749
The sun down south is thunderous.

383
00:34:44,917 --> 00:34:46,749
Here it's raining turds.

384
00:34:47,209 --> 00:34:48,958
It's blinking, my pussy.

385
00:34:50,334 --> 00:34:51,499
Glad to hear it.

386
00:34:52,167 --> 00:34:55,291
I almost shot a communist in a tank,
one pine.

387
00:34:55,917 --> 00:34:57,708
But I wiped it off.

388
00:34:59,875 --> 00:35:01,666
A communist in a tank?

389
00:35:02,334 --> 00:35:03,249
My tenor...

390
00:35:03,459 --> 00:35:06,791
never paint yourself,
never feel yourself.

391
00:35:06,959 --> 00:35:08,791
Don't sniff or whisper.

392
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,666
And never petrify yourself.

393
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,333
Expensive?

394
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,541
Very expensive, Babou.

395
00:35:15,625 --> 00:35:17,624
Why not use your feet?

396
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:19,666
My angel...

397
00:35:19,834 --> 00:35:22,999
the clown brushes his teeth
at the circus.

398
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,666
Okay?

399
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:29,208
- Love you, bimbette.
- Me too, Papou.

400
00:35:29,417 --> 00:35:30,749
I mean Babou.

401
00:35:32,709 --> 00:35:36,041
I'm getting sick and tired
of Radio Londres.

402
00:35:39,709 --> 00:35:41,666
Maria, the table please.

403
00:35:41,834 --> 00:35:45,291
If I mix that with my mother,
what do I get?

404
00:35:47,834 --> 00:35:50,666
Fuck a duck, Maria, it was divine.

405
00:35:52,084 --> 00:35:53,416
It doesn't work.

406
00:35:55,375 --> 00:35:56,666
There are my aunts!

407
00:35:56,834 --> 00:35:59,541
My aunts are great. So feminine...

408
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:02,583
One lives in LA.
She always says...

409
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:04,791
Men are easy.

410
00:36:05,792 --> 00:36:07,749
At first, give them a lot.

411
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:10,833
And I mean a lot.

412
00:36:12,625 --> 00:36:14,458
Once they get hooked,

413
00:36:14,625 --> 00:36:16,291
you stop giving.

414
00:36:16,542 --> 00:36:18,458
Grab them by the balls.

415
00:36:19,167 --> 00:36:20,333
And squeeze.

416
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,708
Her big thing is Gay Pride.

417
00:36:25,875 --> 00:36:28,999
The guys there
are all so charming.

418
00:36:31,792 --> 00:36:34,458
Each of them has an artistic side.

419
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:38,333
Either they sell antiques or flowers.

420
00:36:39,959 --> 00:36:42,291
What do you want to do later?

421
00:36:43,625 --> 00:36:45,041
I don't know...

422
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,333
Journalist.

423
00:36:49,209 --> 00:36:50,916
Not antique salesman?

424
00:36:55,542 --> 00:36:56,666
And the other one...

425
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:58,541
Mi amor...

426
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:02,166
You looked stunning last night.

427
00:37:02,375 --> 00:37:03,958
I had no idea !

428
00:37:06,625 --> 00:37:08,749
Because usually, sorry...

429
00:37:08,917 --> 00:37:11,333
you're a real shambles.

430
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:12,916
A fatal wreck.

431
00:37:13,792 --> 00:37:17,208
For Morocco
along with your mum and brothers,

432
00:37:17,375 --> 00:37:20,666
I invited the wallflower
and that hick of hers.

433
00:37:21,209 --> 00:37:25,624
Come make us laugh
or it will be terribly gloomy.

434
00:37:29,167 --> 00:37:31,624
When you're funny, I'm all yours.

435
00:37:35,959 --> 00:37:37,999
Admit it was irresistible.

436
00:37:38,667 --> 00:37:41,249
Why limit myself to my family?

437
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:43,624
There are lots of women.

438
00:37:44,292 --> 00:37:46,666
They all have something special.

439
00:37:47,167 --> 00:37:48,333
All of them.

440
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:50,708
I started looking at them...

441
00:37:51,709 --> 00:37:53,749
examining every gesture,

442
00:37:54,209 --> 00:37:55,916
every attitude,

443
00:37:56,167 --> 00:37:57,749
every glance...

444
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:59,666
every little tick.

445
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,833
How Martine crosses her legs,

446
00:38:02,584 --> 00:38:04,374
How Isabel touches her hair.

447
00:38:04,959 --> 00:38:07,208
How Christine looks away.

448
00:38:07,375 --> 00:38:10,083
How Victoire fiddles with her rings.

449
00:38:10,667 --> 00:38:12,666
Valerie's breathy "yes".

450
00:38:12,834 --> 00:38:14,291
Do that again.

451
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:15,999
What?

452
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:17,374
That "yes".

453
00:38:19,417 --> 00:38:20,624
You went "yes"...

454
00:38:20,792 --> 00:38:22,333
breathing in...

455
00:38:25,584 --> 00:38:26,999
It was beautiful.

456
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,999
It's amazing.

457
00:38:32,459 --> 00:38:34,958
I just understood something wild.

458
00:38:35,667 --> 00:38:39,791
In fact, the thing that sets
women apart the most...

459
00:38:40,625 --> 00:38:42,499
is their breath.

460
00:38:45,209 --> 00:38:46,958
It's softer.

461
00:38:47,167 --> 00:38:48,624
More varied.

462
00:38:49,459 --> 00:38:52,499
Less linear, less uniform.
That's it.

463
00:38:52,667 --> 00:38:55,291
Her breath in is a state of flux,

464
00:38:55,459 --> 00:38:58,749
depending if she is moved,
or concentrated,

465
00:38:58,917 --> 00:39:01,041
or seductive

466
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,666
or charmed.

467
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,624
And so...

468
00:39:14,875 --> 00:39:17,208
I learned them all.

469
00:39:18,459 --> 00:39:19,624
Every breath.

470
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:23,458
All those respirations

471
00:39:24,625 --> 00:39:27,291
that made my heart beat as one

472
00:39:28,167 --> 00:39:29,291
with women.

473
00:41:38,459 --> 00:41:40,749
It's guy stuff, so butt out!

474
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:10,499
Okay,
your brother tried to drown you,

475
00:42:10,667 --> 00:42:12,749
but don't overreact.

476
00:42:17,625 --> 00:42:20,624
Listen... your aunt wants to eat.

477
00:42:21,375 --> 00:42:24,958
Go unpack and change.
You can't stay in uniform!

478
00:42:32,042 --> 00:42:33,874
So there's something else.

479
00:42:38,959 --> 00:42:40,916
Stop crying or I'll cry.

480
00:42:41,917 --> 00:42:43,208
Then I'll stop.

481
00:42:45,625 --> 00:42:46,874
In fact...

482
00:42:47,292 --> 00:42:48,833
Mum, it's that...

483
00:42:49,584 --> 00:42:52,583
I love Jeremy but he doesn't love me.

484
00:42:52,875 --> 00:42:55,916
I think he's in love
with that dumb Liza.

485
00:42:56,084 --> 00:42:58,583
All she does is chew on her hair.

486
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:01,041
It's awful. She's such a...

487
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:03,958
You know what I mean?

488
00:43:04,292 --> 00:43:05,833
I think I got it.

489
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:09,541
What do you think I should do?

490
00:43:14,542 --> 00:43:16,541
Lots of them live happy lives.

491
00:43:18,042 --> 00:43:20,374
What do you mean, lots of them?

492
00:43:21,625 --> 00:43:22,958
Yes, I mean...

493
00:43:24,459 --> 00:43:25,624
Lots of them.

494
00:43:26,875 --> 00:43:27,958
Lots of what?

495
00:43:29,292 --> 00:43:31,083
What do you mean "what"?

496
00:43:32,084 --> 00:43:33,583
Of...

497
00:43:37,417 --> 00:43:38,833
Of...

498
00:43:40,459 --> 00:43:42,624
You know what I mean, dammit!

499
00:43:44,292 --> 00:43:45,458
I don't.

500
00:43:45,625 --> 00:43:47,791
Boys who like boys.
Homos, fags!

501
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:49,374
Are you that dumb?

502
00:43:50,584 --> 00:43:53,083
Go get changed. Dinnertime.

503
00:44:04,042 --> 00:44:06,083
We can eat in 15 minutes.

504
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,958
What is she talking about?

505
00:44:22,792 --> 00:44:24,874
But I'm not a homo...

506
00:44:25,042 --> 00:44:27,083
because I'm your daughter

507
00:44:27,417 --> 00:44:29,541
who is attracted by a boy.

508
00:44:31,209 --> 00:44:32,958
What could be straighter?

509
00:44:33,167 --> 00:44:35,583
A girl attracted by a boy...

510
00:44:35,792 --> 00:44:37,999
It's not "lots of them".

511
00:44:39,792 --> 00:44:42,583
I'll show you "lots of them"...

512
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:44,083
I can't believe it.

513
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,291
So...

514
00:44:51,959 --> 00:44:54,333
if I'm not really...

515
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:56,624
a girl...

516
00:44:58,625 --> 00:45:00,374
it means that...

517
00:45:03,959 --> 00:45:05,416
it means...

518
00:45:05,792 --> 00:45:08,291
I have to do my military service.

519
00:45:27,292 --> 00:45:29,208
Smallest line you can read.

520
00:45:30,084 --> 00:45:33,208
Behind the line... It's important.

521
00:45:33,459 --> 00:45:34,749
Nothing at all?

522
00:45:35,625 --> 00:45:38,249
Now that I have to be a boy again,

523
00:45:38,417 --> 00:45:42,499
how do I get out of missionary, no...
military service?

524
00:45:45,709 --> 00:45:48,249
So you mention a suicide attempt...

525
00:45:48,417 --> 00:45:49,499
Why?

526
00:45:55,875 --> 00:45:57,208
Because.

527
00:45:58,792 --> 00:45:59,708
Because what?

528
00:46:06,667 --> 00:46:08,624
Because he tried...

529
00:46:14,834 --> 00:46:15,874
to drown me.

530
00:46:17,042 --> 00:46:18,374
Who is he?

531
00:46:23,209 --> 00:46:24,124
The Other.

532
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:31,916
I see.

533
00:46:40,875 --> 00:46:42,458
Why did he...

534
00:46:43,292 --> 00:46:44,583
try to drown you?

535
00:46:48,917 --> 00:46:50,291
Because...

536
00:46:53,917 --> 00:46:55,958
he found out that I...

537
00:46:59,417 --> 00:47:00,958
that I'd had...

538
00:47:01,625 --> 00:47:03,208
a relationship...

539
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:06,166
with a...

540
00:47:07,334 --> 00:47:08,166
A...?

541
00:47:10,542 --> 00:47:11,708
A what?

542
00:47:15,584 --> 00:47:16,708
A what?

543
00:47:30,709 --> 00:47:31,708
A what?

544
00:47:39,625 --> 00:47:40,791
A what?

545
00:47:46,667 --> 00:47:47,749
A what?

546
00:47:53,459 --> 00:47:54,333
Spit it out.

547
00:47:56,292 --> 00:47:57,499
A black guy.

548
00:48:02,625 --> 00:48:03,666
And...

549
00:48:15,709 --> 00:48:19,041
...what do you think of blacks?
Of the Army?

550
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:24,291
I'm afraid.

551
00:48:26,209 --> 00:48:27,291
Why?

552
00:48:28,334 --> 00:48:29,749
Because I...

553
00:48:30,584 --> 00:48:31,958
I spent...

554
00:48:34,459 --> 00:48:35,708
five years...

555
00:48:38,709 --> 00:48:41,208
in boarding school, only with...

556
00:48:41,459 --> 00:48:42,999
boys, and...

557
00:48:44,917 --> 00:48:46,999
I know what it is.

558
00:48:49,167 --> 00:48:49,999
I see.

559
00:48:52,792 --> 00:48:54,958
He imagined such filthy stuff,

560
00:48:55,167 --> 00:48:57,416
he wrote a four-page report.

561
00:48:57,584 --> 00:48:59,041
Yeah, right!

562
00:49:00,334 --> 00:49:01,583
Hello, young man.

563
00:49:02,625 --> 00:49:03,541
Have a seat.

564
00:49:05,209 --> 00:49:06,374
Give me that.

565
00:49:07,042 --> 00:49:08,708
Let's have a look.

566
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:13,499
A little letter from his nice doctor.

567
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:18,791
Obviously... yeah right...

568
00:49:19,375 --> 00:49:21,166
My poor boy...

569
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:23,749
what does the report say?

570
00:49:24,709 --> 00:49:25,916
It says...

571
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:39,499
You don't say...

572
00:49:44,167 --> 00:49:45,458
Oh shit.

573
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:49,333
Excuse me.

574
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:05,791
Sonny...

575
00:50:10,584 --> 00:50:12,249
Listen, young man...

576
00:50:12,917 --> 00:50:16,041
How many times a week
do you see a shrink?

577
00:50:17,125 --> 00:50:18,583
- Twice.
- At least.

578
00:50:20,542 --> 00:50:21,708
Just kidding.

579
00:50:23,625 --> 00:50:25,791
Young man, jokes aside,

580
00:50:26,375 --> 00:50:27,666
are you on meds?

581
00:50:34,917 --> 00:50:36,999
At least you're not alone!

582
00:50:38,584 --> 00:50:39,958
Just kidding.

583
00:50:41,167 --> 00:50:44,458
Young man,
you're unable to be in the Army.

584
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,541
I'm sorry but...

585
00:50:47,709 --> 00:50:49,208
it's not possible.

586
00:50:51,042 --> 00:50:52,499
Not at all.

587
00:50:53,334 --> 00:50:54,749
At all at all...

588
00:50:55,625 --> 00:50:56,958
Not this time.

589
00:50:58,250 --> 00:50:59,541
I'm just kidding.

590
00:51:02,375 --> 00:51:03,624
Just kidding.

591
00:51:05,625 --> 00:51:07,624
If you want some advice,

592
00:51:09,167 --> 00:51:11,208
stay in analysis.

593
00:51:14,167 --> 00:51:15,708
And I'm not kidding.

594
00:51:17,709 --> 00:51:18,999
I took his advice,

595
00:51:19,542 --> 00:51:22,541
but this one
told me his patients antics.

596
00:51:22,709 --> 00:51:25,624
When I mentioned masturbation,
ashamed,

597
00:51:25,792 --> 00:51:27,083
he did this...

598
00:51:33,542 --> 00:51:35,541
All of this depressed me.

599
00:51:37,959 --> 00:51:39,499
When I get depressed,

600
00:51:40,542 --> 00:51:42,291
I found something...

601
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:45,208
I travel.

602
00:51:45,875 --> 00:51:47,999
So to lessen the stress

603
00:51:48,709 --> 00:51:50,041
and the waistline,

604
00:51:50,209 --> 00:51:52,833
I decided on a Bavarian spa.

605
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,958
Why Bavaria, you ask?

606
00:51:55,792 --> 00:51:59,333
I've always wanted to visit
Ludwig's castles.

607
00:51:59,959 --> 00:52:02,083
Because he's Sissi's cousin.

608
00:52:02,625 --> 00:52:04,166
We are what we are.

609
00:52:04,542 --> 00:52:05,958
Also because...

610
00:52:07,125 --> 00:52:09,499
if I'm becoming a homosexual,

611
00:52:09,667 --> 00:52:11,791
better to shoot for the top.

612
00:52:14,125 --> 00:52:15,374
Doctor...

613
00:52:22,125 --> 00:52:24,791
Anyway.... I'm going to love it.

614
00:52:25,459 --> 00:52:26,666
They seem nice.

615
00:52:36,834 --> 00:52:38,666
Mr. Gallienne? I am Raymond.

616
00:52:43,042 --> 00:52:44,916
A sports massage, ja?

617
00:54:08,417 --> 00:54:09,749
That really hurts.

618
00:54:10,792 --> 00:54:12,166
Not the other one.

619
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:14,666
Both, of course.

620
00:54:27,834 --> 00:54:29,291
It's incredibly painful!

621
00:54:29,459 --> 00:54:30,624
Calm down!

622
00:54:49,625 --> 00:54:51,541
I leave in smithereens,

623
00:54:51,709 --> 00:54:54,208
my back in major pain,

624
00:54:54,375 --> 00:54:58,416
praying my next appointment
will be less traumatic.

625
00:55:00,459 --> 00:55:02,833
The gods seem to have heard me.

626
00:55:11,209 --> 00:55:12,458
Follow me?

627
00:55:22,584 --> 00:55:23,541
In here.

628
00:55:25,542 --> 00:55:26,666
Come in.

629
00:55:30,834 --> 00:55:32,416
Undress.

630
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:38,916
Seriously...

631
00:55:39,250 --> 00:55:40,833
it's an obsession here.

632
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:51,666
Lie on your side, facing...

633
00:55:51,959 --> 00:55:53,374
the bathtub.

634
00:55:53,834 --> 00:55:54,666
I obey.

635
00:55:56,125 --> 00:55:57,749
It hurts a little here.

636
00:56:12,167 --> 00:56:14,458
My papa... he worked there.

637
00:56:14,959 --> 00:56:18,583
Really? Not to be indiscreet,
what did "vater" do?

638
00:56:20,667 --> 00:56:22,416
There is indiscretion.

639
00:56:24,042 --> 00:56:25,166
Excuse me.

640
00:56:25,334 --> 00:56:27,041
I'm sorry, Ingeborg.

641
00:56:31,792 --> 00:56:33,083
This will not hurt.

642
00:56:33,417 --> 00:56:35,541
Why on earth would it?

643
00:56:36,875 --> 00:56:38,208
What the fuck?

644
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:39,916
Must relax anus.

645
00:56:43,667 --> 00:56:45,749
Don't overdo it. It's an enema.

646
00:56:45,917 --> 00:56:48,583
People do them every day.
It's healthy.

647
00:56:49,542 --> 00:56:50,499
Ready?

648
00:56:51,209 --> 00:56:55,208
Given my position,
it's hard to be any readier.

649
00:56:57,209 --> 00:56:58,708
You French are so funny!

650
00:56:58,917 --> 00:57:00,624
Here we go...

651
00:57:18,834 --> 00:57:21,124
No more hold it!
I'm dying, Ingeborg!

652
00:57:26,292 --> 00:57:27,916
Vacuum.

653
00:57:33,375 --> 00:57:34,583
Oh my God.

654
00:57:39,584 --> 00:57:41,291
You didn't diet before.

655
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:42,708
What diet?

656
00:57:46,209 --> 00:57:49,291
For colotherapy,
you must diet before.

657
00:57:50,667 --> 00:57:52,791
You didn't have the liquid?

658
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,749
We have to start over.

659
00:57:59,959 --> 00:58:00,791
Start over?

660
00:58:17,875 --> 00:58:18,958
Bitch.

661
00:58:26,167 --> 00:58:27,874
Deflowered by Ingeborg.

662
00:58:28,042 --> 00:58:30,333
That wasn't planned on.

663
00:58:31,334 --> 00:58:33,124
Tell me about the tube.

664
00:58:37,667 --> 00:58:38,833
The tube.

665
00:58:40,834 --> 00:58:41,999
I can't.

666
00:58:42,209 --> 00:58:44,166
Keeping my legs spread wide

667
00:58:44,334 --> 00:58:47,374
and walking like I had bulls balls...

668
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:51,124
It's hard to be virile, right?

669
00:58:57,125 --> 00:58:58,958
Freaks me out, like sports.

670
00:58:59,417 --> 00:59:02,999
Still, I signed up
for swimming classes.

671
00:59:07,584 --> 00:59:08,833
- You okay?
- Enough.

672
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,374
Go relax a little.

673
00:59:10,542 --> 00:59:12,416
Thanks, Bernard...

674
00:59:13,084 --> 00:59:14,291
I've had enough.

675
00:59:22,167 --> 00:59:23,041
Guillaume?

676
00:59:24,542 --> 00:59:25,958
What are you up to?

677
00:59:27,292 --> 00:59:28,333
I'm swimming.

678
00:59:28,542 --> 00:59:29,624
You swim?

679
00:59:31,042 --> 00:59:32,958
I swim like everyone.

680
00:59:34,292 --> 00:59:36,124
You working out too?

681
00:59:36,792 --> 00:59:39,708
You should. It's good for swimming.

682
00:59:40,334 --> 00:59:43,249
I heard myself say something so dumb.

683
00:59:45,084 --> 00:59:47,541
I can't. I have back trouble.

684
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:51,874
Good God!

685
00:59:52,417 --> 00:59:55,458
I have no back trouble, just no balls

686
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,499
to tell that asshole

687
00:59:57,667 --> 01:00:01,916
that I'd rather eat shit and die
than work out!

688
01:00:04,584 --> 01:00:05,416
I'm sorry.

689
01:00:05,584 --> 01:00:06,916
It's not a problem.

690
01:00:19,125 --> 01:00:21,124
You really dislike yourself.

691
01:00:29,917 --> 01:00:31,666
Cry, you'll pee less.

692
01:00:32,542 --> 01:00:34,291
I need to lie down.

693
01:00:34,459 --> 01:00:36,916
We can't have a little laugh?

694
01:00:37,084 --> 01:00:39,166
Such narcissism. Me, me, me.

695
01:00:39,334 --> 01:00:41,583
I need it. I lack self-esteem.

696
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:43,374
You lack reserve.

697
01:00:43,542 --> 01:00:45,416
Who are you talking to?

698
01:00:48,375 --> 01:00:49,541
No one.

699
01:01:00,417 --> 01:01:02,458
You know, cariño,

700
01:01:03,375 --> 01:01:05,833
it's simple. Just fall in love.

701
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,541
If it's a boy, you're gay,
a girl, straight.

702
01:01:13,125 --> 01:01:14,833
When I was young,

703
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,624
I was always told, in great detail,

704
01:01:17,792 --> 01:01:21,499
if I touched a boy before marriage,
I'd go to hell.

705
01:01:21,917 --> 01:01:24,833
So I bagged every girl at school

706
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,999
and never became a lesbian.

707
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,999
As long as you don't try,

708
01:01:30,375 --> 01:01:31,583
you can't know.

709
01:02:50,917 --> 01:02:52,208
Fresh off the boat?

710
01:02:52,750 --> 01:02:53,999
That's for sure.

711
01:02:55,209 --> 01:02:56,416
Where from?

712
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:01,249
Near Casablanca, but I lost the...

713
01:03:01,459 --> 01:03:02,916
Cool, we're cousins.

714
01:03:10,209 --> 01:03:11,791
Want to come over?

715
01:03:12,584 --> 01:03:13,874
I'm Karim.

716
01:03:16,709 --> 01:03:18,124
Sissi... Just kidding.

717
01:03:20,792 --> 01:03:21,624
Got a car?

718
01:03:23,459 --> 01:03:25,791
Follow me. I'm close to Pantin.

719
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:29,458
- Where?
- Near Pantin.

720
01:03:35,042 --> 01:03:37,458
- See you there?
- Out front.

721
01:03:41,542 --> 01:03:43,041
It's hard to see.

722
01:03:43,209 --> 01:03:45,374
Where is Pantin?

723
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,666
Working-class suburb.

724
01:03:48,959 --> 01:03:50,333
Forget about it.

725
01:03:54,167 --> 01:03:56,999
The lights broke. Give me your hand.

726
01:04:00,125 --> 01:04:02,583
- Cold hand.
- I'm a bit chilly.

727
01:04:22,709 --> 01:04:24,416
I'll make some coffee.

728
01:04:32,959 --> 01:04:33,791
Good evening.

729
01:04:34,250 --> 01:04:35,249
Hey.

730
01:04:36,125 --> 01:04:37,291
Nordine.

731
01:04:39,334 --> 01:04:40,708
I'm Tony.

732
01:04:53,042 --> 01:04:54,208
Who's he?

733
01:04:54,584 --> 01:04:55,708
The bitch.

734
01:05:00,917 --> 01:05:03,124
Karim, what are we doing?

735
01:05:03,625 --> 01:05:05,624
You suck then we fuck you.

736
01:05:08,459 --> 01:05:10,374
Sorry, I'm double parked.

737
01:05:10,542 --> 01:05:12,374
I have to go. Sorry to...

738
01:05:12,542 --> 01:05:13,708
Don't panic.

739
01:05:13,917 --> 01:05:16,374
It's just a gangbang. Relax, man.

740
01:05:16,834 --> 01:05:18,624
What's her little name?

741
01:05:19,875 --> 01:05:21,124
My name is Guillaume.

742
01:05:21,292 --> 01:05:22,166
What?

743
01:05:22,542 --> 01:05:23,749
You're not Arab?

744
01:05:26,667 --> 01:05:28,499
Not from Casablanca?

745
01:05:32,459 --> 01:05:36,458
A misunderstanding.
I was on holiday near Casablanca.

746
01:05:37,125 --> 01:05:38,333
So you're a liar.

747
01:05:38,542 --> 01:05:39,583
Not at all.

748
01:05:39,875 --> 01:05:42,124
- A big liar.
- Drop it, Karim.

749
01:05:42,917 --> 01:05:45,458
No, I swear. I'm not a liar.

750
01:05:45,750 --> 01:05:46,833
Get lost!

751
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,958
We're into Arabs, not liars!

752
01:06:36,417 --> 01:06:39,333
For a first try,
it was hard to get worse.

753
01:06:42,084 --> 01:06:43,541
And yet the second try...

754
01:06:46,709 --> 01:06:48,624
You prefer to shower first?

755
01:06:49,792 --> 01:06:50,958
Why shower?

756
01:06:51,125 --> 01:06:52,124
It's...

757
01:06:52,292 --> 01:06:53,416
more hygienic.

758
01:06:54,750 --> 01:06:57,124
If it's more hygienic...

759
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,083
I have no desire to shower.

760
01:07:08,875 --> 01:07:11,208
I'm clean, dammit.

761
01:07:12,042 --> 01:07:14,083
I'll show you hygiene.

762
01:07:23,792 --> 01:07:25,541
It does a world of good.

763
01:07:25,709 --> 01:07:26,833
Perfect.

764
01:07:27,334 --> 01:07:28,416
My turn.

765
01:07:29,709 --> 01:07:32,249
He went to shower next.

766
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:35,124
It lasted... forever!

767
01:07:36,459 --> 01:07:38,583
Child, I must speak to you.

768
01:07:44,959 --> 01:07:46,666
When he came back,

769
01:07:46,875 --> 01:07:49,458
he was stark naked. And I saw...

770
01:07:50,375 --> 01:07:51,791
a horse.

771
01:07:56,542 --> 01:07:59,374
I tried to think of England.
I couldn't.

772
01:08:00,125 --> 01:08:03,416
I was so scared
to be that horse's mattress,

773
01:08:03,584 --> 01:08:06,416
I heard my mother saying :
Obviously...

774
01:08:06,625 --> 01:08:07,916
Horses scare you.

775
01:08:08,459 --> 01:08:10,624
Of course it can't work.

776
01:08:12,292 --> 01:08:13,833
It's true.

777
01:08:16,292 --> 01:08:20,666
I realize I've always done everything
out of fear.

778
01:08:21,125 --> 01:08:23,291
Fear of disappointing Mum.

779
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:24,333
Mum?

780
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:29,833
And the only way to overcome the fear

781
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,958
was to tame the object I feared.

782
01:08:33,959 --> 01:08:38,041
And the object
I fear above all others

783
01:08:40,167 --> 01:08:41,666
is the horse.

784
01:08:42,917 --> 01:08:44,541
What... horse?

785
01:08:59,334 --> 01:09:02,624
I signed up at a riding school
outside Paris.

786
01:09:02,917 --> 01:09:05,666
I went there every morning
at daybreak.

787
01:09:06,292 --> 01:09:08,583
Me in the box, with the horse.

788
01:09:09,834 --> 01:09:11,124
So scary.

789
01:09:17,625 --> 01:09:18,666
You can do it.

790
01:09:20,709 --> 01:09:22,333
But on one condition.

791
01:09:22,709 --> 01:09:24,833
You're no longer 8 and a half.

792
01:09:25,250 --> 01:09:26,374
Okay?

793
01:09:30,084 --> 01:09:31,291
Go ahead.

794
01:09:39,375 --> 01:09:41,499
Do exactly as I say.

795
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,374
Tie the reins.

796
01:09:46,542 --> 01:09:48,708
- What?
- Tie the reins.

797
01:09:59,709 --> 01:10:00,541
Like this?

798
01:10:03,917 --> 01:10:05,624
Now let go of them.

799
01:10:10,250 --> 01:10:11,458
Like this?

800
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:14,624
No more stirrups.

801
01:10:20,334 --> 01:10:21,624
Like this?

802
01:10:25,375 --> 01:10:26,958
Now close your eyes.

803
01:10:35,667 --> 01:10:37,374
And trust the animal.

804
01:10:54,125 --> 01:10:55,208
Very good.

805
01:11:48,542 --> 01:11:51,374
Soon after,
I called my friend Clemence:

806
01:11:51,542 --> 01:11:52,416
What's doing?

807
01:11:52,584 --> 01:11:53,999
Dinner with the girls.

808
01:11:54,167 --> 01:11:55,083
I'm coming!

809
01:11:55,250 --> 01:11:57,666
No, you don't even know them.

810
01:11:57,834 --> 01:12:00,166
I'll wear a skirt and heels,
if necessary!

811
01:12:01,417 --> 01:12:03,708
Don't hog the conversation.

812
01:12:03,875 --> 01:12:06,499
Why on earth would you say that?

813
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:10,666
I go,
fortunately not in a skirt and heels,

814
01:12:11,084 --> 01:12:12,291
and there...

815
01:12:13,292 --> 01:12:16,708
I see the most beautiful woman
in the world.

816
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:21,458
The only woman
who could be so pretty,

817
01:12:22,167 --> 01:12:23,791
so cute

818
01:12:24,334 --> 01:12:25,374
and so beautiful

819
01:12:25,709 --> 01:12:26,749
at the same time.

820
01:12:26,917 --> 01:12:28,624
- Guillaume.
- Amandine.

821
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:39,583
As I watch her,
tons of words whirl through my head.

822
01:12:39,750 --> 01:12:40,999
He's very effeminate.

823
01:12:41,167 --> 01:12:42,374
Hey, faggot!

824
01:12:42,542 --> 01:12:44,124
She's wearing panties!

825
01:12:44,292 --> 01:12:46,874
...so gay, you've become lesbian.

826
01:12:47,042 --> 01:12:48,416
No reserve... Scram!

827
01:12:48,584 --> 01:12:49,416
Queer...

828
01:12:49,584 --> 01:12:50,708
You should try.

829
01:12:50,875 --> 01:12:52,374
It's very simple...

830
01:12:52,542 --> 01:12:53,999
Boys and Guillaume,
dinner!

831
01:12:54,167 --> 01:12:56,833
Amid all that, I hear Clemence:

832
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,083
Girls and Guillaume,
dinner!

833
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:02,458
- What?
- Girls and Guillaume, dinner.

834
01:13:02,792 --> 01:13:04,583
I love the idea!

835
01:13:05,459 --> 01:13:08,249
"Girls and Guillaume, dinner!"

836
01:13:09,709 --> 01:13:12,374
Girls and Guillaume.

837
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:16,583
Never thought I'd hear that.

838
01:13:16,750 --> 01:13:19,249
Girls... and Guillaume.

839
01:13:20,542 --> 01:13:21,916
I looked at Amandine.

840
01:13:22,875 --> 01:13:23,999
I smiled at her.

841
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:26,791
And I wasn't afraid.

842
01:13:27,792 --> 01:13:30,708
So not afraid,
I mentioned my good thighs.

843
01:13:30,917 --> 01:13:32,374
I have good thighs.

844
01:14:01,875 --> 01:14:03,499
A few months later

845
01:14:03,667 --> 01:14:05,874
I saw my mother and I said...

846
01:14:06,250 --> 01:14:08,999
Mum, I have two things to tell you.

847
01:14:11,334 --> 01:14:13,249
The first is that...

848
01:14:14,042 --> 01:14:16,416
I've decided to write a play.

849
01:14:16,584 --> 01:14:20,624
About a boy who learns
to accept his heterosexuality

850
01:14:20,792 --> 01:14:24,458
in a family
that decided he was homosexual.

851
01:14:35,584 --> 01:14:37,874
Help me clear the table...

852
01:14:48,917 --> 01:14:51,208
There's something I don't get.

853
01:14:51,542 --> 01:14:53,541
This guy in the story...

854
01:14:55,125 --> 01:14:56,624
is 100% straight?

855
01:15:00,875 --> 01:15:02,624
If I understand correctly,

856
01:15:02,917 --> 01:15:04,541
his whole family

857
01:15:05,250 --> 01:15:08,374
is persuaded he's 100% gay.

858
01:15:08,792 --> 01:15:09,999
Right?

859
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:16,791
But in fact, he's 100% straight.

860
01:15:17,250 --> 01:15:18,499
Right?

861
01:15:19,917 --> 01:15:21,416
Where's the proof?

862
01:15:23,792 --> 01:15:24,624
Of what?

863
01:15:24,792 --> 01:15:26,958
That he's 100% straight?

864
01:15:28,292 --> 01:15:32,083
How can the public know
he's 100% straight?

865
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:35,999
His whole family is sure
he's 100% gay...

866
01:15:36,750 --> 01:15:40,374
Unless his whole family
is a bunch of idiots!

867
01:15:41,125 --> 01:15:42,833
Where is the proof...

868
01:15:44,209 --> 01:15:46,291
that he's 100% straight?

869
01:15:50,750 --> 01:15:52,083
First of all,

870
01:15:52,250 --> 01:15:55,083
it's not a question
of percentage, but...

871
01:15:56,584 --> 01:15:58,916
you're right to ask, Mum.

872
01:15:59,167 --> 01:16:01,749
The proof, as you call it,

873
01:16:01,917 --> 01:16:04,708
is that he fell in love with a woman.

874
01:16:06,125 --> 01:16:08,291
Repentant fag. But concretely?

875
01:16:15,875 --> 01:16:17,874
I look at my mother

876
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,166
and I understand everything.

877
01:16:22,875 --> 01:16:26,291
I understand
that she's the one who's afraid.

878
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,624
Afraid that I love a woman
other than her.

879
01:16:34,084 --> 01:16:36,374
It seems so completely wild!

880
01:16:37,709 --> 01:16:39,208
A fear like that.

881
01:16:40,667 --> 01:16:42,958
I want to say I always loved her.

882
01:16:43,125 --> 01:16:44,124
It's not because

883
01:16:44,334 --> 01:16:46,249
I love Amandine

884
01:16:47,125 --> 01:16:50,208
that I'll stop loving her.

885
01:16:53,542 --> 01:16:56,333
I want to tell her that in fact...

886
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:58,874
It's thanks to her, I adore women.

887
01:16:59,042 --> 01:17:01,958
Thanks to her,
I learned to watch them

888
01:17:02,125 --> 01:17:04,166
and to listen, especially.

889
01:17:07,042 --> 01:17:08,874
I want to tell her that...

890
01:17:14,459 --> 01:17:15,916
to tell her...

891
01:17:20,917 --> 01:17:24,791
that it's her reserve...
that gave me words.

892
01:17:27,084 --> 01:17:28,958
Her elegance

893
01:17:29,459 --> 01:17:31,249
gave me good bearing.

894
01:17:32,750 --> 01:17:36,458
Her humor, the desire to laugh
and make others laugh.

895
01:17:37,792 --> 01:17:39,499
And her confidence

896
01:17:39,959 --> 01:17:41,791
that gave me courage.

897
01:17:44,834 --> 01:17:46,333
I want to tell her...

898
01:17:49,042 --> 01:17:50,791
I want to tell her

899
01:17:52,209 --> 01:17:54,249
it's thanks to her

900
01:17:54,584 --> 01:17:56,166
that I am here.

901
01:17:58,959 --> 01:18:00,249
I want...

902
01:18:04,125 --> 01:18:05,624
but I can't.

903
01:18:07,459 --> 01:18:10,958
I can't because if I do, I'll cry...

904
01:18:11,875 --> 01:18:13,791
and boys don't cry.

905
01:18:17,667 --> 01:18:18,958
No, and...

906
01:18:19,167 --> 01:18:20,999
I know her.

907
01:18:21,959 --> 01:18:23,874
If I say all that...

908
01:18:24,542 --> 01:18:26,583
it'll make her uncomfortable.

909
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:31,166
She's very reserved, my mother.

910
01:18:35,625 --> 01:18:39,166
Even if she sometimes
calls me "baby-doll",

911
01:18:39,792 --> 01:18:42,458
she knows that I am a boy.

912
01:18:43,125 --> 01:18:44,499
That's how it is.

913
01:18:45,542 --> 01:18:48,541
Even if we pretended the opposite,

914
01:18:48,709 --> 01:18:50,124
she and I.

915
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:53,958
It made our lives easier.

916
01:18:56,667 --> 01:18:58,791
Hers, to have a daughter.

917
01:19:00,125 --> 01:19:01,333
And mine...

918
01:19:02,709 --> 01:19:06,041
to set myself apart from my brothers.

919
01:19:07,959 --> 01:19:09,624
To distinguish myself.

920
01:19:11,084 --> 01:19:13,124
But all that's over now.

921
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,333
It's over...

922
01:19:15,875 --> 01:19:18,291
because I love Amandine.

923
01:19:19,042 --> 01:19:20,708
And Amandine loves me.

924
01:19:21,417 --> 01:19:22,333
I'll say so.

925
01:19:25,167 --> 01:19:28,999
Concretely,
it's good you asked because...

926
01:19:29,209 --> 01:19:31,291
because concretely, as you say,

927
01:19:31,792 --> 01:19:36,416
the second thing is that
Amandine and I are getting married.

928
01:19:37,417 --> 01:19:38,708
With who?

929
01:20:06,417 --> 01:20:08,166
Break a leg.

930
01:20:08,334 --> 01:20:09,749
Love, Mum.

931
01:26:17,167 --> 01:26:20,291
