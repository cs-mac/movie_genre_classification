1
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:24,750
That's what he did to me.

2
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,610
How big was it?

3
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:35,985
I don't know. It was a decent log.

4
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:42,096
That's disgusting.
I can't believe he did that.

5
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:43,292
All right, fellas.

6
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:46,099
Small blind, big blind, 25, 50.

7
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:48,834
Chip leader Jeremy Benton
is the first to act.

8
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:55,403
That's the thing.

9
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:59,349
He would always threaten me
that he was gonna take a crap in the tub,

10
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,419
'cause we took baths together.

11
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,454
So he was always threatening.

12
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:04,022
And then, finally, one day,

13
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,592
he just has this huge smile on his face,

14
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:10,720
and this shit log comes rolling down
and grazes my knee.

15
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,659
Well, that's Jeremy for ya.

16
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:13,993
Exactly.

17
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,367
Mr. Benton takes the pot again.

18
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,627
Cash me in, Don. I'm done.

19
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,168
Okay.

20
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:30,580
I mean, he's probably
not even gonna be there, right?

21
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:33,379
He's got the poker tournament,

22
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:37,013
your mom said he's not coming,
I don't think he's coming.

23
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,682
Hypothetically...

24
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:40,684
Yeah?

25
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:43,662
If your brother didn't invite you
to his birthday party,

26
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:45,924
would it hurt your feelings?

27
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:50,826
Are we gonna go?

28
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:52,931
Hey, sport.

29
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:55,400
We're just figuring out
what we're doing right now, Hunter.

30
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:56,733
Whatever.

31
00:02:57,977 --> 00:03:00,844
Yeah, I mean, the party's gonna be lame.

32
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:04,274
I'm pretty busy, it's a long way.

33
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:07,519
Yeah. You should just stay here with me.

34
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:13,690
You know, this is fucking ridiculous.
Do you wanna party this weekend?

35
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,623
I'm ready to do some serious partying.

36
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,456
I'm ready to tear into
some ice cream and some cake, too.

37
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:20,533
-Yeah.
-I'm looking forward to that.

38
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:22,123
Let's do it, then. We're going?

39
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:23,361
Yeah, we're going.

40
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:25,096
-Final decision?
-Yeah.

41
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,570
Let's do it.

42
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:53,030
Let's go.

43
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,398
Jesus.

44
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,628
Grandma!

45
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:32,738
-Hi!
-Hi!

46
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,067
Hey, Mom.

47
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:38,037
Oh, look at you, Mark.
I'm so glad to see you.

48
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:39,509
Say hi to Grandma.

49
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:42,638
Oh, he's grown!

50
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,699
Okay.

51
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:08,069
The first birthday activity,
the Capitol 5K Fun Run.

52
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:09,174
Son.

53
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:11,169
I'll get it.

54
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:14,978
Shouldn't call it the Fun Run,
we should call it the Suck Run.

55
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:16,181
Oh, hello!

56
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:17,749
Hunter, I wish you wouldn't
say things like that.

57
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,045
Yes, I just finished breakfast.

58
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:22,551
Why do we have to do this,
like, every year?

59
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:25,283
It's a family tradition, son.

60
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:27,120
No. It's not a good idea.

61
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:29,023
Seems like
everything's a tradition.

62
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:30,789
Finish up your cereal.
We're gonna go soon, okay?

63
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,227
I wish you would stop doing that.

64
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,857
Let's get this show on the road,
guys. All right? We'll clean it up later.

65
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:36,025
Okay.

66
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:38,802
-Mom? We need to go. Are you...
-Okay. Bye-bye.

67
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:42,668
Who's calling so early?

68
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:44,208
It was Nancy.

69
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,878
Let's go, party people.
We're gonna be late.

70
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:50,511
Now, of course, we'll be led

71
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:54,416
by the world famous Jack Hayes
up on the bicycle.

72
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:02,260
Jack will take you to the right.

73
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,754
Jack Hayes, you ready?

74
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:06,589
-All right!
-Right!

75
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,933
Runners, on your marks.

76
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:13,597
Go!

77
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:32,458
Jeremy?

78
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:33,682
Hey, Ma.

79
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,831
-This is fun, huh, guys?
-Yeah!

80
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:54,174
What do you say we increase
the excitement with a little wager?

81
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:56,679
-What kind of wager?
-Like a...

82
00:06:56,783 --> 00:07:00,014
-I don't know, like whoever...
-What about $5,000?

83
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:01,243
Uncle Jeremy!

84
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:03,188
What's up, dawg?

85
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:05,450
-A little late.
-Hey, I thought you were playing poker.

86
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:06,525
I was. I won.

87
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:08,491
-Sweet.
-Uh-huh.

88
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,692
Happy birthday, bro.

89
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:14,831
-You surprised to see me?
-No.

90
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:16,496
Oh, well.

91
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:19,799
I'm feeling pretty good today.
I think I'm gonna stretch these legs out.

92
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:22,340
I'll see you guys at the finish line.

93
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:24,271
Unless someone wants to come with me.

94
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:25,366
-I'll come.
-No...

95
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:27,105
No, Hunter, we're gonna
stick together, babe.

96
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:28,713
God! Fine.

97
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:33,711
I'm gonna go talk to him.

98
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:34,787
Mark, come on.

99
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:36,013
It's fine. Relax.

100
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,646
Well, he gets to go.

101
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:39,152
Hunter, not now.

102
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:41,158
You know what? I'm done.

103
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:43,185
Hunter.

104
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,796
Look, I have enough problems
in my life right now.

105
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:54,202
I just wanna have a nice weekend
with my family, so go home.

106
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,774
All right, I'll get out of here.

107
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,537
But you're gonna have
to beat me in this race, okay?

108
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:00,979
That's stupid.

109
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:05,645
I'm serious. You beat me in this race,
I'll get the hell out of here, right now.

110
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:07,980
Yeah, I'm looking to graduate.

111
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,069
Looking good!

112
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:02,634
Yeah!

113
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:09,600
Yeah!

114
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:10,733
Dad.

115
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:12,733
-Dad.
-Hey.

116
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:14,972
-Dad, are you all right?
-Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

117
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:16,241
Give me a high five.

118
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:17,644
-Okay.
-All right.

119
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,489
Yeah!

120
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:30,394
What do you want me to say?

121
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,261
I told you I was sorry.

122
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,526
Mom, I'm meditating right now.

123
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,743
I didn't tell him anything.

124
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:49,303
Mom, we talked on the phone,
you said he wasn't gonna be here.

125
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:53,852
He wasn't! He just figured it out
because it was your birthday.

126
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:55,451
Why do you think he's here?

127
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:57,988
So he can try to destroy me.

128
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,489
That is crazy.

129
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:01,492
-I'm telling you, it's not, Mom.
-That is ridiculous.

130
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:04,392
He loves you, he just wants
to be around you.

131
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:05,655
Shoot.

132
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:07,494
He has no other brother. You're it.

133
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,626
You're building up this whole thing
in your mind.

134
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:12,966
Mom, you don't think
I know my own brother?

135
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:14,198
I can hear you guys.

136
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,237
Oh, hi, Jeremy.

137
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,435
Hi, Mark.

138
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:19,771
Hi, Mom.

139
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:23,673
We're just talking about
what we're gonna have for dinner.

140
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:25,075
Sure.

141
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:00,510
Okay.

142
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:01,916
I'm Mark Benton.

143
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:04,421
And I'm Jeremy Benton.
And welcome to...

144
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,517
-The Do-Deca-Pentathlon.
-The Do-Deca-Pentathlon.

145
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:07,614
I solemnly swear...

146
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,557
I solemnly swear...

147
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:11,890
...that I will complete
all 25 of these events.

148
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:14,431
I will complete all 25 of these events.

149
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:16,398
-And whoever wins...
-Whoever wins...

150
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:17,627
... will be declared the better...

151
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:24,407
God damn it.

152
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,584
Sorry I'm late.

153
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:47,359
Hi, Mom.

154
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:48,791
So, what's that?

155
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:50,929
Nothing.

156
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:54,497
What's "Do-Deca"?

157
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:58,237
Feel like telling your son
what Do-Deca is, buddy?

158
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:03,547
It's nothing, Hunter. It's just...

159
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:05,741
No, what is that?

160
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:09,082
Stupid games your uncle
and I used to play.

161
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,358
What's the Do-Deca, Jeremy?

162
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:19,525
Well, when your dad
and I were in high school,

163
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,066
one summer, we came up
with this competition

164
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:24,261
called the "Do-Deca-Pentathlon."

165
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,600
Which is, basically, 25 events,

166
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:31,836
and the one who won the most events
was crowned Champion of All Time.

167
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:34,435
-Dinner is so great, Alice.
-Yeah. It's delicious.

168
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,408
-Your salad really made it.
-Thank you.

169
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:39,450
-The salad really is good.
-Thank you.

170
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:42,520
I think it'd be great, actually,
if we pop this in, maybe, and watch it.

171
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:43,780
All right, that's enough.

172
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:45,082
I wanna see the tape.

173
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:47,182
We're not seeing the tape,
we're having dinner.

174
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:48,920
What? After.

175
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:51,357
-Can I see it?
-Sure.

176
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:55,765
There is one slight problem, though.
There's no more footage, it's been erased.

177
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:56,857
What?

178
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:58,197
Well, that's too bad.

179
00:13:58,304 --> 00:13:59,862
-Yeah, it is.
-Mom.

180
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:00,961
Yeah.

181
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:04,303
Somebody erased it. Wonder who did.

182
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,571
Mark, you know anything about this?

183
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,943
Mom, this steak is really good.

184
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:10,743
-Sure is.
-I'm glad you like it.

185
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,875
Now, like, who won?

186
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:15,713
It was a tie.

187
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:16,810
It was?

188
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:18,184
Always a tie with Grandma.

189
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,485
-Well, how did it get to be a tie?
-She knows.

190
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:24,186
Well, we're all tied up
coming into the final event.

191
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:27,197
The "hold your breath underwater" event.

192
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:29,767
Mark got yanked out
of the water first by Grandpa,

193
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,336
'cause he thought we were drowning.

194
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:32,904
-That's right.
-Rules are rules.

195
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:35,803
He interrupted, so it was a tie.

196
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:38,170
No, Mom. We made the rules,
you didn't make the rules.

197
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:40,973
Right, Mark? You know what the rules are.

198
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:47,784
It sucks for you, but you lost.

199
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:50,616
But he didn't come up on his own.

200
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:52,888
It doesn't matter, Mom.

201
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:55,888
It clearly only matters
to one person at this table.

202
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:56,995
-Absolutely.
-Thank you.

203
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:58,495
Am I the only one at the table
that it matters?

204
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:00,626
-Who's that one person?
-Yes!

205
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:01,927
It doesn't matter to me, Jeremy.

206
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:03,929
Really?

207
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:06,498
So, cool. I won, right?

208
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:10,307
Maybe you should just tell him that he won
so we can just move past this.

209
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,401
That would solve everything,
once and for all.

210
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:17,305
Mom, is it okay if I have
a second helping of steak?

211
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,441
-Sure, Mark. Sure. Anybody else?
-Did you hear your wife, Mark?

212
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,712
It doesn't matter,
so tell him that he won.

213
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:23,081
I don't get
why this is such a big deal.

214
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:24,416
That's all you have to do.

215
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:25,547
It doesn't matter.

216
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:28,024
So, you can just tell him that he won.
Why are you being like this?

217
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:29,151
'Cause it doesn't matter.

218
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,819
Listen to your wife, my bro.

219
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,558
-I do not want another weekend ruined.
-Thank you, Stephanie.

220
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:52,441
You okay?

221
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:53,711
Yeah. Fine.

222
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:55,411
-You sure?
-Yeah.

223
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,421
-You don't look so fine.
-I'm fine.

224
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,220
-Yeah?
-I'm fine.

225
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:04,758
-Relax, okay?
-Okay.

226
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,627
I'm good. Let's go sleepy.

227
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:12,327
-Okay.
-Yep.

228
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:20,807
Who put this here?

229
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:28,648
Wow.

230
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,616
Jesus.

231
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:38,256
It's pretty ridiculous.

232
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:55,079
You know what I was thinking about?

233
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,380
Maybe...

234
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:00,710
Maybe we should leave tomorrow.

235
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:02,810
Go somewhere.

236
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:05,917
-Like a...
-Really?

237
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:09,017
Yeah, like go to a hotel,

238
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:14,296
lay out by the pool,
order some room service.

239
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,424
Mmm-hmm.

240
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:18,628
Eat some pancakes in bed.

241
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:20,227
-Mmm.
-Mmm.

242
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,636
Watch some movies,
just totally chill out, you know?

243
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:29,310
Have a super relaxing couple of days,
just the three of us.

244
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:30,643
Mmm-hmm.

245
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:33,650
'Cause I think that, I don't think
we're gonna get that here.

246
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:36,014
You know, the way things have been going.

247
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:39,415
-Mmm-hmm.
-I think it's just better to get out of here.

248
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:40,785
Just go.

249
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:42,494
Mmm.

250
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:50,091
Yeah. Just a thought.
Something I was thinking about.

251
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:51,169
Mmm-hmm.

252
00:17:57,109 --> 00:18:02,137
You ever just look at Jeremy's legs?

253
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:09,878
And his hands?

254
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:16,219
And his face?

255
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:21,428
He reminds me of, like...

256
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:26,096
Like a troll, you know?

257
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:30,608
That guards a bridge or something
in England.

258
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:32,768
You know what I mean?

259
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,777
Or, like, a leprechaun.

260
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:43,320
But not a leprechaun that you find at
the pot of gold, you know?

261
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:44,855
Another kind of leprechaun.

262
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:48,016
Bad leprechaun.

263
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:52,759
I don't know.

264
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:58,565
I just can't believe that
he's my brother sometimes.

265
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:02,264
Yeah, I get that.

266
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:08,745
Yeah, hi, sorry about
calling you at this hour.

267
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:10,040
And how can I help you?

268
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:13,209
I'm calling about your son.

269
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:17,818
And we need to talk.
It's very important.

270
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:19,485
Okay.

271
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:23,089
He was caught vandalizing
the school today.

272
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:27,831
It occurred back in the tennis courts
in the back of the school.

273
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:30,766
He dumped out a big,
50-gallon drums of grease

274
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:33,497
all over the goddamn tennis courts.

275
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,539
Are you kidding me? You're a goddamn...

276
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:39,301
That was awesome.

277
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:43,780
Do you wanna lead one on?
Do you wanna do one? Okay.

278
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:46,214
Here, I'll pick the number,
you dial it up.

279
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:48,047
Like father, like son, buddy.

280
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:51,217
Dad did this?

281
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:52,585
You better believe it.

282
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,352
He taught me everything I know.

283
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:56,592
Wow.

284
00:19:57,629 --> 00:19:59,494
Well, why is he so lame now?

285
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,800
You know, I can't answer that question,
to be honest with you,

286
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:09,032
but he's been pretty much
of a fake tool lately.

287
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:10,441
Yeah.

288
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:14,478
It wasn't always like that, though.

289
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:18,207
Wanna do another one?

290
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:19,306
Yeah.

291
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:22,819
All right, Alexa Serpus.

292
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:39,759
You can't sleep?

293
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:46,677
Don't do that.

294
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:50,905
What's up? You're sick?

295
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:52,038
No.

296
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:54,041
What are those pills for?

297
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,485
Dick broken?

298
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:57,689
Mmm-mmm.

299
00:20:57,856 --> 00:20:59,790
-Hair pill?
-No.

300
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:01,658
Logjam?

301
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:03,961
-Shitting rivers?
-No.

302
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:07,595
Depressed?

303
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:14,395
Good night, Jeremy.

304
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:15,495
Hey, Mark.

305
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:20,944
Quick game of pool?

306
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:25,640
Get in.

307
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:39,456
Nice shot.

308
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:42,626
Easy shot.

309
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:53,768
How's life, bro?

310
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:56,770
It's great. Don't talk to me.

311
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:06,090
What's that you're doing now?

312
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:09,285
Consulting or what is it
the hell you're doing?

313
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:12,988
Pet food consulting and marketing, yes.
Don't talk to me.

314
00:22:13,298 --> 00:22:14,822
That's good.

315
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:16,195
You happy?

316
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:17,962
Absolutely.

317
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:22,874
Uh-huh.

318
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:27,908
Wanna look in my eyes
when I ask you that next time?

319
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:33,140
Can you look in my eyes and answer that?

320
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:35,453
I'm happy.

321
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:41,486
So what about you, are you happy?

322
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:42,924
No.

323
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:44,858
See? Then shut up about it.

324
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:47,195
At least I can admit it.

325
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:49,833
You just want me to be
miserable like you are.

326
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:52,169
Is that what Stephanie says?

327
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:53,771
I know what you're trying to do.

328
00:22:53,905 --> 00:22:55,202
What's that, champ?

329
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:57,898
You're trying to distract me.

330
00:22:58,009 --> 00:22:59,408
Oh, really?

331
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:01,305
Not doing a very good job.

332
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:05,183
Uh-huh. 'Cause I'm about to run
the table on your ass.

333
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:12,020
You have any final words?

334
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:14,190
Two out of three?

335
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:24,830
Rack 'em up.

336
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,403
Yeah.

337
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:50,956
17-18, your serve.

338
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:52,654
You boys want some pancakes?

339
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:55,160
-Hey, Mom.
-Hey, Mom.

340
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:58,367
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Yeah, that's great.

341
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:11,282
Fuck!

342
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:01,560
Good morning.

343
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:04,524
Good morning.

344
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:05,762
How did you sleep?

345
00:25:06,204 --> 00:25:08,138
-Slept great.
-Good.

346
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:37,267
What do you wanna
do today, sweetie?

347
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:40,127
I don't know. Whatever you wanna do.

348
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:45,399
Maybe go for a walk this morning?

349
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,102
Yeah, that would be great.

350
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:55,251
-Hi.
-Hey.

351
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:57,421
I think he's bluffing.

352
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:59,914
All right, so then what
do you wanna do about that?

353
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,260
Look, I'm just trying
to look out for Mark, you know?

354
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:05,396
I'll bluff with him.

355
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:06,464
What do you want to do?

356
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,499
I don't know. I mean,

357
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,161
maybe we should just try
this again some other time.

358
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:13,666
Oh, don't do that.

359
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:16,935
You know I haven't had any time
with Hunter. I had all these plans.

360
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:20,136
I know, and we're going
to plan another weekend again soon.

361
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:23,111
It's you're so far away,
and to take another flight here,

362
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:26,843
I mean, you're not gonna
do that till Christmas probably.

363
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:28,009
I'll tell you what,

364
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:30,087
I'll get Jeremy a hotel room.

365
00:26:30,188 --> 00:26:32,019
You know, it's so crowded in the house.
So...

366
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:34,148
-Hey, Mom.
-Morning.

367
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:35,656
-Babe.
-Hey, sweetie.

368
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,259
What are you guys doing?

369
00:26:38,463 --> 00:26:39,555
Online poker.

370
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,425
Cool.

371
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:16,327
Are you serious?

372
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,360
Mmm-hmm. I'm in.

373
00:27:19,604 --> 00:27:20,901
Thank you.

374
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:23,374
Okay, so here's the deal.

375
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:28,377
I've been seeing a shrink
and a physician.

376
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:33,548
And they both don't want me
doing anything that stresses me out.

377
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:36,149
Stephanie knows this.

378
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:39,883
So we have to create
a little bit of a smokescreen.

379
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:41,117
Can you handle that?

380
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:42,226
Of course.

381
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,316
Okay.

382
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:44,952
Just let me take the lead.

383
00:27:53,905 --> 00:27:58,137
So I don't wanna make
a big deal out of this,

384
00:27:58,243 --> 00:28:01,701
but Jeremy and I have been talking,

385
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,707
and we think that

386
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:10,050
it's time for us to move past
all our immature antics.

387
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:13,215
And just be brothers.

388
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:15,092
I'm gonna go ahead and say

389
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:20,187
I'm at fault for a majority
of all the tension that's taken place,

390
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:22,230
and I apologize,

391
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:24,927
and I'm just a little embarrassed,
to be honest with you.

392
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,901
It's not your fault. I mean, I... We're...

393
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:28,562
Yes, it is. Hey.

394
00:28:28,673 --> 00:28:31,733
Well, I'm accepting responsibility
for my actions, too.

395
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:33,708
It's a 50-50 thing.

396
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:35,109
-It's not gonna be solved today.
-Right.

397
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:36,339
It's not gonna be solved tomorrow.

398
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:42,080
But we're gonna make
a concerted effort this weekend

399
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:47,249
to turn over a new leaf
and find the love that we...

400
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:48,949
It's there.

401
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:50,585
There's no love lost.

402
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:53,357
It's just, we can't find it right now.
And we're looking for it.

403
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:57,601
Well, I'm really proud of you boys.

404
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:59,835
Thanks, Mom.

405
00:29:01,005 --> 00:29:02,472
Love you, Mom.

406
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:19,315
What the hell? 11:00!

407
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,984
Oh, no, it doesn't open until 11:00.

408
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:24,485
-Well, that's okay, we can come back later.
-It opens right now.

409
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,063
No, no, no.

410
00:29:27,732 --> 00:29:28,824
Hey!

411
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,094
Do you see someone?

412
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:33,727
I left my wallet yesterday.

413
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:35,669
-Come on, we can come back later.
-He's making Slurpees.

414
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:40,575
I left my wallet! I gotta catch a plane.
I need my...

415
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:41,970
-Is he coming?
-Don't break that glass.

416
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,809
-No.
-Just leave him alone.

417
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:45,405
-Tell him Hunter has cancer.
-He's...

418
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:46,539
-What?
-What?

419
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:48,050
-Good one, bro.
-All right.

420
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:49,278
-What?
-It'll work.

421
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:50,376
-No, no, no.
-You can't say that!

422
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:52,717
Our boy's got cancer.

423
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:55,418
Make-A-Wish is here. 9:00.

424
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,925
-Don't smile. Don't smile.
-That's terrible.

425
00:29:57,061 --> 00:29:59,086
You shouldn't joke about
things like that!

426
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:00,425
I've got cancer.

427
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:02,432
Stop it! Stop it!

428
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,125
-Mom, stop!
-Stop it, that's so terrible.

429
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:06,292
-Is he coming?
-No.

430
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:07,665
-He's not coming?
-I got his attention.

431
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:10,741
I have to show him the
old-fashioned way.

432
00:30:17,048 --> 00:30:19,778
All right, guys,
put your vest on over your head.

433
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:21,181
The name in the front.

434
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:22,947
Buckle both sides.

435
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:24,749
Are you sure you wanna do this?

436
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:25,914
Yeah.

437
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:27,150
Yeah?

438
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:28,850
If you wanna sit out,
I'll sit out with you.

439
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:30,884
But I don't wanna sit out.

440
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:32,493
Yeah, you actually put it on backwards.

441
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:34,063
-Just take it easy, okay?
-I will.

442
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:35,924
-Spin around.
-I've played before.

443
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:37,626
I just want to make sure
you take it easy, okay?

444
00:30:37,802 --> 00:30:39,030
I'm gonna take it easy.

445
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:40,767
All right, lift your arms up.

446
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:41,839
This is stinky.

447
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,502
Yeah, they all smell.

448
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:45,041
I think I'll just sit this one out.

449
00:30:45,276 --> 00:30:47,073
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, I'll watch.

450
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:48,907
All right. Let's get this off of you.

451
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:51,072
Everybody, the game we're gonna
be playing is sudden death.

452
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,647
Once you get tagged once,
you're out of the game,

453
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:56,083
go to the holding area
in the center of the arena.

454
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:58,246
Last person standing is the champion.

455
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,618
Any questions?

456
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:01,555
Are there any accessories
that come with this?

457
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:04,059
Can I get a scope for
long-range shooting?

458
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:07,162
-I think you'll be fine with what you got.
-Okay.

459
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:12,801
Hey, we're gonna drop Steph and Hunter,
and we'll get to work.

460
00:31:12,937 --> 00:31:14,302
Yeah, yeah, but you got to get Stephanie.

461
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:16,305
-'Cause if I get her, she'll kill me.
-Copy.

462
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:21,003
Five, four, three, two, one. Go!

463
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:32,113
Deactivated.

464
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:33,417
Oh, come on!

465
00:31:33,591 --> 00:31:34,558
-Who did that?
-Got her.

466
00:31:34,692 --> 00:31:36,785
-Mark?
-It wasn't me.

467
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:40,459
-Twelve o'clock.
-Look out!

468
00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:42,933
Hunter, look out!

469
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:44,335
Shh!

470
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:47,067
They're up to something.

471
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:48,229
What do you mean?

472
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:50,634
They're being really nice to each other.

473
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:18,761
It's a trap!

474
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:21,331
That way!

475
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:32,980
Where'd he go?

476
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:54,836
Dad, Dad, are you okay?

477
00:32:54,939 --> 00:32:57,737
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm good.

478
00:33:00,044 --> 00:33:01,477
Deactivated.

479
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:03,170
Oh, man!

480
00:33:06,684 --> 00:33:08,276
Truce till we get up top.

481
00:33:10,621 --> 00:33:11,679
Mark.

482
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:14,349
Deactivated.

483
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:15,426
What are you doing?

484
00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:16,720
It's time to go home.

485
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,489
Can I get a reset here?

486
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:20,597
There is no reset. The game is over.

487
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:22,561
You're not even playing,
you can't shoot me.

488
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:24,691
It's time to go home.

489
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:27,561
-Five more minutes.
-Mark.

490
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:29,404
Oh, come on!

491
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:49,118
So today at laser tag,

492
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:54,864
there were some things that happened
that were outside of my control. And...

493
00:33:54,966 --> 00:33:57,264
Yeah, please rein in Stephanie.

494
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:59,598
But null and void. Interference.

495
00:34:02,273 --> 00:34:03,570
Thank you.

496
00:34:04,175 --> 00:34:05,733
We got a lot of ground to cover.

497
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:06,969
Yeah, we do.

498
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:09,577
And tomorrow's my birthday party.

499
00:34:11,682 --> 00:34:14,981
All right. Let's focus
up and get back at it.

500
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:18,349
Okay, get out of here.
I'll follow you out later.

501
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:20,014
We'll stagger it.

502
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,498
Good God... Christ, you scared me.

503
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:30,362
What do you got there?

504
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:34,763
Oh, it's just an awesome margarita recipe

505
00:34:34,872 --> 00:34:37,932
I was gonna whip up tomorrow.

506
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:40,067
-Oh, sounds good.
-For the party.

507
00:34:41,112 --> 00:34:42,875
Can you close the door for a second?

508
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:45,812
-I was just gonna go whip up a batch.
-Just close the door.

509
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:46,884
What's up?

510
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:48,383
Just close the door.

511
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,817
What's going on?

512
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,691
I know that you guys
are doing the Do-Deca.

513
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:02,991
No.

514
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:07,069
You guys are tip-toeing around
and whispering and hiding behind doors.

515
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:09,731
And I'm not stupid,
I know what's going on.

516
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:12,173
I know my husband well enough
to know what's going on.

517
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,437
We're not playing the Do-Deca again.

518
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:16,274
-No?
-No.

519
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:20,915
Okay, fine, we played a few games
of Ping-Pong last night.

520
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,310
You played Ping-Pong last night?

521
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:30,227
Jeremy, if it was just about fun and games,
I would be all about it,

522
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:32,888
because I want Mark to be happy.

523
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:37,024
But it's not just sports
between the two of you.

524
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,695
-Yes, it is.
-We both know that.

525
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:43,399
And his doctor and his psychiatrist
are both very adamant

526
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:45,100
that he needs to be taking it easy.

527
00:35:45,209 --> 00:35:47,803
For health purposes,
for emotional purposes,

528
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:49,877
for his level of happiness.

529
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,846
So I'm asking you,

530
00:35:51,949 --> 00:35:55,715
if you could please tell him that
you don't wanna do it anymore.

531
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:59,656
We're not doing the Do-Deca.
I just told you. Just a few of the sports.

532
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:03,284
And if that means that you need
to leave or that we need to leave,

533
00:36:03,394 --> 00:36:04,952
-it's all cool. Okay.
-Okay, let's just tone it down now.

534
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:06,222
Because there's one thing.

535
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,527
Let's keep this between us, okay?

536
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:12,364
That's fine, I would prefer that, actually.

537
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:15,028
-That's the adult way to handle this.
-Yeah, absolutely.

538
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:16,697
-Okay.
-I totally agree.

539
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:20,436
So, will you drop out of the race, please?

540
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,477
No can do.

541
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,467
There you are!

542
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:48,371
I didn't know you smoke.

543
00:36:49,273 --> 00:36:51,104
I was just having one.

544
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,643
Are you okay?

545
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:54,800
Yeah.

546
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,242
You don't look like you are.

547
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:02,583
Oh, sweetie.

548
00:37:05,656 --> 00:37:07,453
What's the matter?

549
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:09,890
Oh, honey.

550
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:12,862
I'm fine. It's okay.

551
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,089
I'm okay.

552
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,498
Is there something I can do to help you?

553
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:23,231
It's just Mark.

554
00:37:24,775 --> 00:37:27,107
He's such a wreck right now.

555
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:32,012
And now being around Jeremy, he's just...

556
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:33,276
I can see it happening.

557
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:36,512
He's just getting into that mode of where
he's starting to think about

558
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:38,782
what his life would be like
if he wasn't married.

559
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:42,347
And just like playing poker all day.

560
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:46,328
I mean, sometimes I feel like
that's what he really wants.

561
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:51,024
Maybe I can help you.

562
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,799
Mark and Jeremy are still mama's boys.

563
00:37:54,905 --> 00:37:57,339
I still have some power, Stephanie.

564
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:01,275
Okay.

565
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:13,117
-Wow.
-Hmm.

566
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:16,919
You boys like it?

567
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:18,085
-Mmm.
-Mmm.

568
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:28,271
So, Jeremy and I were talking and

569
00:38:28,372 --> 00:38:30,636
we're thinking, like,
we might go see a movie.

570
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:33,073
We haven't seen a movie together,
like, in forever.

571
00:38:33,177 --> 00:38:36,146
So, we're gonna catch a flick.

572
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:38,538
What are you guys gonna do?

573
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:42,176
Boys, we have something
that we want to say.

574
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:43,878
Yeah, but the movie starts soon, right?

575
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:44,955
-Yeah, like, in 10 minutes.
-Yeah.

576
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:47,718
What I think
your mother is trying to say is that,

577
00:38:49,126 --> 00:38:53,893
we've been feeling like you guys are kind of
excluding the rest of the family.

578
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,933
And are very wrapped up
in each other right now.

579
00:38:57,034 --> 00:38:59,662
It would be nice if we, like,
did things together.

580
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:02,261
All of us together.
Like, we could all go to the movie.

581
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:03,397
That's a great idea.

582
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:05,065
It's an R movie and
Hunter can't come. And...

583
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:07,167
Well, he could stay with me
and then the three of you can go out.

584
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:08,711
And I'll go with you. That's a great idea.

585
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:10,144
-Well, it's...
-That'll be fun.

586
00:39:10,247 --> 00:39:11,714
It's an action movie.
It's not a movie for women.

587
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:14,284
That's okay. I would love to go
to the movie with you guys.

588
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:15,875
That's a great idea.

589
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:19,782
You like action movies?

590
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:22,085
-All of a sudden?
-Yeah, I do. I do.

591
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,889
Well, I saw it as an opportunity

592
00:39:24,995 --> 00:39:27,361
for me and Jeremy
to hang out and bond, you know.

593
00:39:27,465 --> 00:39:31,424
And there's certain things that brothers
talk about privately that, you know...

594
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:32,900
We have a lot of catching up to do.

595
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:34,602
-Mark.
-Yeah.

596
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:37,265
You're lying to me right now.
You're not going to a movie.

597
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,673
I know what you guys are out doing.

598
00:39:39,777 --> 00:39:40,801
What?

599
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:43,004
You know what?
We'll come back with the ticket stubs,

600
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:45,981
and we'll give 'em to you.
If you don't believe us. Right?

601
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:50,615
I mean, come on!
We were just gonna hang out as brothers.

602
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:53,519
Didn't you spend enough time last night
playing Ping-Pong together?

603
00:40:21,685 --> 00:40:23,050
Hunter?

604
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:27,552
Hunter, you awake?

605
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:30,151
What?

606
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:33,552
Listen, now, I just wanted to tell you that

607
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,534
I'm sorry about dinner tonight,
all the arguing.

608
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:39,830
Whatever.

609
00:40:40,404 --> 00:40:44,340
No, I mean it. It's totally unacceptable.

610
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,034
Shut up.

611
00:40:48,345 --> 00:40:50,336
Did you just tell me to shut up?

612
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:53,915
Yes.

613
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,776
Okay.

614
00:41:00,524 --> 00:41:03,391
That's not appropriate talk to your dad.

615
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,225
Why are you so fake all the time?

616
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:08,093
What are you talking about?

617
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:09,658
You.

618
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:11,824
How am I being fake?

619
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,631
And you're always fake around me.

620
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:19,298
Why can't we just have a real conversation
like I have with Jeremy?

621
00:41:23,747 --> 00:41:25,840
Well, what do you and Jeremy talk about?

622
00:41:27,618 --> 00:41:29,176
Stuff.

623
00:41:30,087 --> 00:41:33,056
Like girls?

624
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:34,650
No.

625
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:36,693
Like sports?

626
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:42,229
No. Stuff just, like,
comes up naturally between us.

627
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:49,036
I don't know what to say.

628
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:51,468
Just forget it.

629
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:54,444
We tried.

630
00:42:02,052 --> 00:42:05,544
Okay, elbows on the table,
both feet on the floor at all times.

631
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:10,455
Left hand on the table,
but do not grab for leverage.

632
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:14,258
I know the rules, just be very, very quiet.

633
00:42:15,232 --> 00:42:17,291
-Are you wearing shoes?
-Yeah.

634
00:42:17,401 --> 00:42:20,302
I'm not wearing shoes, take them off.

635
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:23,237
All right, fair enough.

636
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,602
-You happy?
-Yep.

637
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,073
On my go.

638
00:42:26,176 --> 00:42:27,302
On three.

639
00:42:27,411 --> 00:42:28,378
On three or my go?

640
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,470
-No, no, on three.
-Okay.

641
00:42:31,615 --> 00:42:37,451
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

642
00:43:00,477 --> 00:43:02,502
Probably gonna get caught.

643
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:06,075
You gonna tell Mom?

644
00:43:09,653 --> 00:43:10,620
No.

645
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:45,614
Are you gonna let him
beat you right away?

646
00:44:14,084 --> 00:44:15,312
Do it now, Dad!

647
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:21,775
Thanks, Hunter.

648
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:23,847
No problem.

649
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:54,180
We're gonna take the old bikes to the shop.
The chains are rusty. All right, and we...

650
00:45:55,652 --> 00:45:58,450
I have a couple more items
for your grocery list.

651
00:45:58,856 --> 00:46:00,847
I'm not going to the grocery store.

652
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:02,789
I have to stay and watch the stove.

653
00:46:02,893 --> 00:46:04,417
I thought that
you were gonna be able to go.

654
00:46:04,862 --> 00:46:07,092
You know what,
I've gotta pick up Aunt Melba.

655
00:46:07,197 --> 00:46:10,132
You know how she is, she has to be
the first person here when there's a party.

656
00:46:10,234 --> 00:46:16,605
-Okay, I have to watch the stove. Hunter?
-Yep?

657
00:46:16,707 --> 00:46:18,436
Would you mind running down the street

658
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:20,635
and picking up a couple of things
from the grocery store for me?

659
00:46:20,744 --> 00:46:21,711
Sure.

660
00:46:21,812 --> 00:46:23,609
You know that's about a mile away.

661
00:46:23,714 --> 00:46:26,683
No, it's not, it's just a few blocks.
I think he can handle it.

662
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:28,183
I can do it, Jeremy.

663
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:29,582
Yeah, he's done it before.

664
00:46:30,487 --> 00:46:32,216
Did you finish your sign?

665
00:46:32,322 --> 00:46:34,586
Almost. All I have to do is two letters.

666
00:46:34,992 --> 00:46:37,654
See, yeah, Mark and I'll take care of it.
We got plenty of balloons blown.

667
00:46:37,761 --> 00:46:39,456
No. I don't think so.

668
00:46:39,563 --> 00:46:42,088
Okay. I'll just go.

669
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:46,602
-All right, cool. Hunter and I'll go.
-Really? Is that all right?

670
00:46:46,703 --> 00:46:47,761
Just the two of you?

671
00:46:47,871 --> 00:46:49,099
-Yeah.
-Yep.

672
00:46:49,206 --> 00:46:51,538
-And Mark stays here?
-Yes.

673
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:53,576
-The whole time?
-The whole time.

674
00:46:53,677 --> 00:46:54,666
Jesus.

675
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,045
Okay, yeah, that's all right.

676
00:46:58,015 --> 00:46:59,482
End of the block.

677
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:04,450
Take care. Be back soon, okay?

678
00:47:05,422 --> 00:47:07,947
-Bye, Steph.
-Bye. Thanks, Jeremy.

679
00:47:08,091 --> 00:47:09,217
If you guys could hurry back,

680
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:10,850
I need some of those things
right away, okay?

681
00:47:10,961 --> 00:47:12,087
-Be right back.
-Right back.

682
00:47:12,196 --> 00:47:13,493
Thank you.

683
00:47:21,038 --> 00:47:23,370
There's no way
he's getting out of there.

684
00:47:23,874 --> 00:47:26,035
-You don't think so, huh?
-Nope.

685
00:47:30,814 --> 00:47:32,805
Come on, Mark.

686
00:47:36,753 --> 00:47:39,779
No, no way! No fuckin' way.

687
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:41,619
Language, shithead.

688
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:48,223
God damn, look at him.
He's a wolf in sheep's clothing.

689
00:47:51,802 --> 00:47:56,466
Okay, here he comes.
You're about to meet the real Mark Benton.

690
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:12,787
Let's go. I got one hour for a jog.

691
00:48:13,624 --> 00:48:15,387
Good job, Dad.

692
00:49:16,053 --> 00:49:17,020
Oh, shit!

693
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:27,160
Yes!

694
00:49:40,043 --> 00:49:41,203
Go!

695
00:49:46,516 --> 00:49:47,915
Shit!

696
00:50:00,597 --> 00:50:05,830
Three. Two. One. Go!

697
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:55,741
Hi! How's it going?

698
00:50:58,255 --> 00:50:59,222
Hi!

699
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:17,828
How much time we got left?

700
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:20,496
It's 4:15.

701
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:24,434
It's 4:15.

702
00:52:24,708 --> 00:52:26,232
How long have we been gone?

703
00:52:26,343 --> 00:52:27,640
Like, four and a half hours.

704
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:31,070
We've been gone
four and a half fucking hours.

705
00:52:32,048 --> 00:52:33,675
What are we gonna do?

706
00:52:34,951 --> 00:52:37,283
We have three more events. Let's go.

707
00:52:47,764 --> 00:52:48,890
Open up! Let's go.

708
00:52:49,099 --> 00:52:50,726
Take it easy on my ride, guy.

709
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:54,930
Come on. And your ride's fine. Let's go.
Open up. What are you all doing?

710
00:52:55,038 --> 00:52:56,027
Are you serious right now?

711
00:52:56,139 --> 00:52:58,664
-Yeah! What are you all doing?
-Chill out! We're going home.

712
00:52:58,775 --> 00:53:01,300
No, we're not! We got three more events,
we're doing this now.

713
00:53:01,411 --> 00:53:02,378
-Dad!
-We're going home.

714
00:53:02,479 --> 00:53:03,571
-Get in the car.
-Dad!

715
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:04,647
Open the door.

716
00:53:04,748 --> 00:53:06,409
-We're finishing this tomorrow, bro.
-Yeah.

717
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:10,646
Open the door! Open the door!

718
00:53:11,321 --> 00:53:14,290
Open it! Open the door!

719
00:53:15,625 --> 00:53:16,717
You're scaring me, Mark.

720
00:53:16,826 --> 00:53:18,691
-What do you mean? I'm scaring you?
-Yeah, man.

721
00:53:18,895 --> 00:53:19,953
Calm down.

722
00:53:20,063 --> 00:53:21,894
You're seriously
not finishing this right now?

723
00:53:21,998 --> 00:53:24,523
Not right now, we're
doing this tomorrow.

724
00:53:32,576 --> 00:53:33,702
Geez.

725
00:53:34,678 --> 00:53:35,804
Can I have the keys?

726
00:53:35,912 --> 00:53:37,470
Open it now, you jammed it.

727
00:53:37,581 --> 00:53:40,015
Get in the car and calm down.

728
00:53:42,953 --> 00:53:44,614
We're just gonna have to let
him sit there for a minute.

729
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:45,710
He'll be all right.

730
00:53:48,658 --> 00:53:50,353
Oh, damn it!

731
00:53:54,464 --> 00:53:56,489
God damn it!

732
00:54:18,622 --> 00:54:20,681
Here's the stuff.

733
00:54:46,216 --> 00:54:50,209
I wanna know where the fuck
you have been for the last five hours.

734
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:54,621
Are you gonna answer me?

735
00:54:55,825 --> 00:54:59,090
Can you not talk to me like that?
Seriously.

736
00:54:59,596 --> 00:55:02,724
Just chill out. Chill out.

737
00:55:02,832 --> 00:55:04,197
-Chill out?
-Yeah.

738
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:05,290
All right, I'm chill.

739
00:55:05,402 --> 00:55:07,267
Give me a chance to at least say I'm sorry.

740
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:10,669
Just go ahead, say that you're sorry.
Now tell me where you were.

741
00:55:10,774 --> 00:55:13,140
-I'm sorry.
-Where were you?

742
00:55:13,243 --> 00:55:15,143
I've been doing the Do-Deca with Jeremy.

743
00:55:16,546 --> 00:55:17,672
Where?

744
00:55:17,781 --> 00:55:20,249
All over the place.
At the Y, the playground, everywhere.

745
00:55:21,217 --> 00:55:25,176
Go-kart track.
And we were at the Fun Arcade, too.

746
00:55:26,589 --> 00:55:28,079
You missed your entire party.

747
00:55:28,191 --> 00:55:31,558
I know. That's why
I just wanna say I'm sorry. Okay?

748
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:34,459
Can I just say I'm sorry?
And can we just move past it?

749
00:55:34,564 --> 00:55:35,929
You lied to me.

750
00:55:36,032 --> 00:55:36,999
Yeah, I lied to you.

751
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:39,159
Because if I tell you the truth,
you freak out.

752
00:55:39,269 --> 00:55:41,499
-So I have to lie.
-I don't freak out, Mark.

753
00:55:41,604 --> 00:55:44,471
You lied to me because you knew
that you were doing something wrong.

754
00:55:44,574 --> 00:55:46,098
No, I wasn't doing anything wrong.

755
00:55:46,209 --> 00:55:48,973
I just had to deceive you to do something
that makes me feel good, you know?

756
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:50,205
And that's fucking crazy.

757
00:55:50,313 --> 00:55:51,974
That's not something
that makes you feel good.

758
00:55:52,082 --> 00:55:55,017
And whatever you think it is, that is not
something that makes you feel good,

759
00:55:55,118 --> 00:55:56,210
that's not something that's good for you.

760
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:59,015
No, no. It is good for me,
because it does make me feel good,

761
00:55:59,122 --> 00:56:00,555
and it makes me happy, okay?

762
00:56:00,657 --> 00:56:04,252
Today, I had more fun
than I've had in, probably, fuckin' 10 years.

763
00:56:06,463 --> 00:56:10,229
I'm not trying
to keep you from being happy, Mark.

764
00:56:10,333 --> 00:56:12,767
You're acting like a crazy man.

765
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:16,327
I'm finishing the Do-Deca tomorrow,
that's all there is to it, okay?

766
00:56:16,439 --> 00:56:20,205
If you do the Do-Deca tomorrow,
I am leaving tomorrow morning.

767
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:23,108
You're gonna leave because I'm gonna
play sports with my brother tomorrow?

768
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:26,182
No. I'm gonna leave
because you're being an asshole.

769
00:56:29,953 --> 00:56:31,250
All right.

770
00:56:31,921 --> 00:56:33,149
All right what?

771
00:56:33,256 --> 00:56:34,245
Then leave.

772
00:56:39,329 --> 00:56:40,921
You're not worried about Mark?

773
00:56:41,331 --> 00:56:44,698
No, I'm not worried about Mark.
I'm pissed at Mark.

774
00:56:45,769 --> 00:56:49,330
He's got everything he could possibly need.

775
00:56:49,439 --> 00:56:51,964
They got this great son.

776
00:56:52,675 --> 00:56:54,666
-He's terrific.
-Yeah, he's awesome.

777
00:56:55,512 --> 00:57:00,006
He's got a beautiful damn family,
and he's moping around like a big ass baby.

778
00:57:00,183 --> 00:57:03,277
Why don't you talk to him?
You could do it tonight.

779
00:57:03,386 --> 00:57:06,321
I'm not gonna talk to him. We don't do that.

780
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:09,053
Well, you could start doing it.

781
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:11,525
We have fun
by beating the shit out of one another.

782
00:57:11,995 --> 00:57:13,690
That is so crazy.

783
00:57:13,797 --> 00:57:17,324
I wanna take him outside and rub his face
in the goddamn concrete.

784
00:57:18,168 --> 00:57:21,899
To cheese-grate the shit right out of him
and make him eat it.

785
00:57:22,906 --> 00:57:26,433
A big slice of fucking life taco.

786
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:31,804
Well, I just want things
to work out with them.

787
00:57:31,915 --> 00:57:34,349
And, you know, he wants to do
everything you wanna do.

788
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:36,112
He wants to be like you.

789
00:57:36,219 --> 00:57:38,881
Bullshit. Mom,
when are you gonna stop with that?

790
00:57:39,556 --> 00:57:42,252
Give me a break.
He thinks I'm a piece of shit.

791
00:57:42,392 --> 00:57:44,826
He does not. You're some big poker star.

792
00:57:44,928 --> 00:57:49,126
And I'd be invited to this birthday weekend
if he wanted to be like me.

793
00:57:52,168 --> 00:57:54,762
I want you guys to want me here.

794
00:57:55,605 --> 00:57:57,470
You're always wanted at home,

795
00:57:58,107 --> 00:58:02,305
but I'm just not sure your being
here is best for them right now.

796
00:58:24,463 --> 00:58:26,431
There's beer out in the garage.

797
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:28,632
I wanted a tallboy.

798
00:58:31,837 --> 00:58:35,238
So what are you doing out here? Thinking?

799
00:58:36,508 --> 00:58:38,840
Thinking about how tomorrow
you're gonna get your ass whipped?

800
00:58:38,944 --> 00:58:41,276
Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm thinking.

801
00:58:44,283 --> 00:58:46,217
What's going on in there?

802
00:58:47,186 --> 00:58:48,448
-In here?
-Yeah.

803
00:58:49,788 --> 00:58:51,983
-What, Stephanie?
-Yeah.

804
00:58:53,459 --> 00:58:57,293
I mean, I love her, you know? But...

805
00:58:59,932 --> 00:59:04,369
I just feel like opening the front door
sometimes and just walking away.

806
00:59:05,604 --> 00:59:06,969
Not looking back.

807
00:59:12,644 --> 00:59:14,544
She just doesn't get it.

808
00:59:17,449 --> 00:59:18,677
Get what?

809
00:59:19,785 --> 00:59:22,913
That we ruined your birthday party today
that she planned?

810
00:59:24,223 --> 00:59:26,748
And I basically looked her
straight in the eye

811
00:59:26,859 --> 00:59:29,623
and said I'll be right back from the store?

812
00:59:30,262 --> 00:59:36,929
Kidnapped her son, and you go for a jog and
we come back four and a half hours later?

813
00:59:37,035 --> 00:59:40,562
I mean, think about that, man.
What we did today.

814
00:59:41,473 --> 00:59:44,340
Yeah, I know what we did today.
It was fucking great.

815
00:59:45,210 --> 00:59:47,269
I don't know,
maybe this is just going a little too far,

816
00:59:47,379 --> 00:59:49,074
that's all I'm saying.

817
00:59:53,685 --> 00:59:57,177
You're fucking with me.
You're fucking with me.

818
01:00:04,329 --> 01:00:06,388
Of course I'm fucking with you.

819
01:00:06,498 --> 01:00:08,193
-Jesus!
-Relax.

820
01:00:09,601 --> 01:00:14,561
Okay, good, 'cause I was about to say,
"What the fuck is wrong with you?"

821
01:00:16,041 --> 01:00:19,875
All right, so, I'm gonna get
the boxing gloves and mouth pieces,

822
01:00:19,978 --> 01:00:20,945
9:00 a.m.,

823
01:00:21,046 --> 01:00:25,278
and finish up and be prepared
to get your ass kicked.

824
01:00:26,385 --> 01:00:27,909
All right. Good. Yeah.

825
01:00:28,887 --> 01:00:34,757
Let's just enjoy the final round tomorrow,
and once and for all, do this.

826
01:00:37,863 --> 01:00:39,057
Hope you sleep well.

827
01:00:39,898 --> 01:00:41,297
You too, brother.

828
01:00:42,468 --> 01:00:44,561
-Good night, buddy.
-Good night.

829
01:01:01,587 --> 01:01:02,713
Oh, my God!

830
01:01:03,021 --> 01:01:04,215
Hey, buddy.

831
01:01:04,923 --> 01:01:06,254
Hi.

832
01:01:06,358 --> 01:01:07,416
I got to go, okay?

833
01:01:07,526 --> 01:01:08,550
Why?

834
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:11,959
I got to get out of here.
It sucks, but I gotta leave.

835
01:01:12,397 --> 01:01:15,195
What? What about the Do-Deca?

836
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:20,431
I know. But you remember,
we finish in a tie in this house.

837
01:01:20,806 --> 01:01:22,398
It's what Grandma wants.

838
01:01:23,308 --> 01:01:24,969
When am I gonna see you again?

839
01:01:27,546 --> 01:01:28,808
We'll see.

840
01:01:29,314 --> 01:01:32,044
Anyhow, you're the best.

841
01:01:36,488 --> 01:01:37,512
I love you.

842
01:01:37,623 --> 01:01:39,147
I love you, too.

843
01:01:47,666 --> 01:01:51,067
Don't you go changing,
unless you shit your pants.

844
01:02:09,688 --> 01:02:11,087
Get out of the car!

845
01:02:11,189 --> 01:02:12,656
Where in the hell did you come from?

846
01:02:12,791 --> 01:02:14,088
Get the fuck out of the car!

847
01:02:14,192 --> 01:02:16,752
Get your freaky ass the
fuck out of my face.

848
01:02:18,497 --> 01:02:19,828
Get off my car right...

849
01:02:19,932 --> 01:02:21,797
Get out of the car!

850
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:24,266
-Goddamn car!
-Where do you think you're going?

851
01:02:24,369 --> 01:02:26,837
I'm going to the store
to get Mom some eggs and shit,

852
01:02:26,939 --> 01:02:28,736
so just get out of the way.

853
01:02:28,874 --> 01:02:30,341
Get the fuck in the house.

854
01:02:35,914 --> 01:02:38,747
Son of a bitch!
Don't ever push me from behind again!

855
01:02:38,850 --> 01:02:40,511
Cheap shot!

856
01:02:41,086 --> 01:02:42,246
Get up. Come on!

857
01:02:45,524 --> 01:02:48,152
-Come on! Get up.
-Don't push me in the fucking bushes.

858
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:49,352
-Get up!
-Shit.

859
01:02:49,461 --> 01:02:50,553
Get up!

860
01:02:55,968 --> 01:02:57,265
Dad!

861
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:02,634
Get your hands up.

862
01:03:03,008 --> 01:03:04,066
-Put your fucking hands up.
-No!

863
01:03:04,576 --> 01:03:05,907
-Put them up!
-You're gonna do this in front of...

864
01:03:06,011 --> 01:03:07,444
-Put your hands up!
-No!

865
01:03:07,546 --> 01:03:09,411
-Come on!
-You wanna do this in front of your family?

866
01:03:09,514 --> 01:03:10,481
-Stop!
-Put your hands up!

867
01:03:10,582 --> 01:03:12,641
-You wanna hit me right now?
-Yeah, I'm gonna knock you out!

868
01:03:12,784 --> 01:03:13,751
Get away from me!

869
01:03:13,852 --> 01:03:15,877
Yeah, let's do it right here
in front of your son.

870
01:03:15,988 --> 01:03:17,478
-Get your hands up.
-Jeremy!

871
01:03:17,589 --> 01:03:18,578
-Get 'em up!
-Mark!

872
01:03:18,690 --> 01:03:21,488
Stop it right now! Look at me! Mark.

873
01:07:35,447 --> 01:07:37,415
I can't believe I let this happen.

874
01:07:44,689 --> 01:07:47,351
I can't believe I let myself get so fat.

875
01:07:55,533 --> 01:07:59,401
Well, I mean, look at this.

876
01:07:59,504 --> 01:08:02,496
Look. Look at my foot.

877
01:08:05,477 --> 01:08:08,173
My foot is fat.

878
01:08:12,617 --> 01:08:15,745
You think when couples meet us
for the first time,

879
01:08:16,621 --> 01:08:18,748
and then they go home
and then they talk about us,

880
01:08:18,857 --> 01:08:24,625
you think they say,
"Oh, she's the one married to the fat guy."

881
01:08:25,664 --> 01:08:27,393
I don't think that's what they say.

882
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:34,370
Come on. Just level with me.

883
01:08:35,674 --> 01:08:36,868
I'm fat.

884
01:08:39,577 --> 01:08:41,738
Yeah, you're a little bit fat.

885
01:08:45,984 --> 01:08:47,212
-God damn it!
-Then why did you want me to tell...

886
01:08:47,319 --> 01:08:49,184
You just said that
you wanted me to tell you, so I...

887
01:08:49,287 --> 01:08:51,346
No, no, no. I mean, no.

888
01:08:51,456 --> 01:08:53,151
You're right. You're right. This is good.

889
01:08:53,358 --> 01:08:55,690
I wanted to hear this from you.

890
01:08:55,794 --> 01:08:59,093
Okay. Well, I think that
you should lose some weight.

891
01:09:00,398 --> 01:09:01,524
How?

892
01:09:02,167 --> 01:09:06,604
Just start making healthier choices.
Eating better.

893
01:09:07,305 --> 01:09:10,172
Yeah, I mean, that's the thing.
I mean, I think the food that I eat is okay.

894
01:09:10,275 --> 01:09:13,210
It's just portion control.

895
01:09:16,114 --> 01:09:19,208
And we have to keep chocolate
out of the house.

896
01:09:20,185 --> 01:09:23,848
Because, I mean, I know you like chocolate,
and you eat chocolate and you stay thin.

897
01:09:23,955 --> 01:09:27,789
But if I eat chocolate,
I'd turn into a bigger fat-ass.

898
01:09:27,892 --> 01:09:30,452
Can I still eat chocolate, like,
when you're not around?

899
01:09:30,562 --> 01:09:31,756
Or when I go out of the house?

900
01:09:31,896 --> 01:09:34,524
If you're with your girlfriends,
you can eat chocolate.

901
01:09:36,067 --> 01:09:38,661
But you gotta brush your teeth afterwards.

902
01:09:39,604 --> 01:09:43,165
'Cause I'll smell that shit,
and then the whole thing will start

903
01:09:43,274 --> 01:09:47,802
and then I'll just be, like,
jonesing for chocolate, you know?

904
01:10:06,865 --> 01:10:08,992
I'm sorry, Stephanie.

905
01:10:29,788 --> 01:10:33,884
-Mom, it's okay, it's just stupid goodbyes.
-Okay.

906
01:10:36,795 --> 01:10:39,559
-Steph.
-Take care of yourself, Jeremy.

907
01:10:53,411 --> 01:10:55,242
I'm gonna go finish packing, okay?

908
01:11:32,550 --> 01:11:33,517
Sup?

909
01:11:34,719 --> 01:11:35,708
Sup?

910
01:11:38,957 --> 01:11:40,652
Tire looks low.

911
01:11:42,494 --> 01:11:44,155
-Oh, it does?
-Yeah.

912
01:11:44,863 --> 01:11:45,830
Huh.

913
01:11:47,098 --> 01:11:48,759
You should get it checked out.

914
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:50,861
Yeah, I will.

915
01:11:54,706 --> 01:11:57,732
So, what do you got going on next?

916
01:11:59,277 --> 01:12:00,767
I don't know.

917
01:12:01,746 --> 01:12:03,680
Any tournaments or anything
coming up or...

918
01:12:03,781 --> 01:12:06,079
Yeah, I mean, there's always tournaments.

919
01:12:07,519 --> 01:12:08,645
I don't know.

920
01:12:10,388 --> 01:12:16,384
I'm just kind of getting burnt
in the whole poker biz.

921
01:12:16,961 --> 01:12:18,053
Really?

922
01:12:18,796 --> 01:12:22,129
Yeah, I just, my head's not...
Hadn't been in it.

923
01:12:23,835 --> 01:12:25,496
Bored, you know?

924
01:12:30,542 --> 01:12:32,772
I don't know what the fuck
I'm gonna do, honestly.

925
01:12:32,877 --> 01:12:36,335
It's just... It's getting to that point.

926
01:12:37,048 --> 01:12:40,745
And I'll figure it out.

927
01:12:45,924 --> 01:12:47,289
When you guys leaving?

928
01:12:48,059 --> 01:12:49,287
In a couple hours.

929
01:12:52,797 --> 01:12:55,459
Yeah. Weekend went by fast.

930
01:12:56,401 --> 01:12:58,130
-Yeah.
-Yep.

931
01:13:01,306 --> 01:13:04,764
Yeah, I better get rolling, I guess.
I've got a long ass drive.

932
01:13:04,876 --> 01:13:06,343
All right.

933
01:13:10,882 --> 01:13:13,248
Jeremy, well, look, uh...

934
01:13:15,954 --> 01:13:22,621
If you wanna come stay with us,
you can, you know?

935
01:13:24,395 --> 01:13:27,489
We got an extra bedroom and...

936
01:13:28,766 --> 01:13:34,261
If you wanna just come visit, you know,

937
01:13:34,606 --> 01:13:36,096
we'd love to have you.

938
01:13:38,676 --> 01:13:40,234
I mean, if you want to.

939
01:13:53,591 --> 01:13:56,424
That kicks ass.

940
01:14:01,032 --> 01:14:02,966
All right, get out of here.

941
01:15:05,229 --> 01:15:09,097
# There were moments of dreams
I was offered to save

942
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:13,296
# I live less like a workhorse,
more like a slave

943
01:15:13,404 --> 01:15:17,602
# I thought that one quick moment
that was noble or brave

944
01:15:17,709 --> 01:15:20,974
# Would be worth the most of my life

945
01:15:21,546 --> 01:15:25,812
# So I pointed my fingers
and shouted a few quotes I knew

946
01:15:25,917 --> 01:15:30,149
# As if something that's written
should be taken as true

947
01:15:30,254 --> 01:15:34,156
# But every path I had taken
and conclusion I drew

948
01:15:34,258 --> 01:15:37,716
# Would put truth back under the knife

949
01:15:38,563 --> 01:15:43,933
# And now the only piece of advice
that continues to help

950
01:15:46,604 --> 01:15:52,668
# Is anyone that's making anything new
only breaks something else

951
01:15:56,214 --> 01:16:02,517
# When my time comes

952
01:16:03,354 --> 01:16:08,087
# Oh, oh, oh

953
01:16:13,331 --> 01:16:17,028
# When my time comes...
