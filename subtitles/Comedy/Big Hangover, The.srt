1
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:07,470
Sir.

2
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:10,829
Sir!

3
00:00:10,829 --> 00:00:12,829
Sir.

4
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:13,730
Open your eyes.

5
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:14,380
Sir!

6
00:00:14,379 --> 00:00:15,699
What happened here, sir?

7
00:00:15,699 --> 00:00:17,259
Go start the car first.

8
00:00:17,259 --> 00:00:19,079
- Hurry!
- Yes, sir.

9
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:20,249
Okay.

10
00:00:20,249 --> 00:00:22,829
Sir!

11
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:25,559
Sir, wake up, please.

12
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:27,009
You have to hang in there.

13
00:00:27,009 --> 00:00:28,449
You have to live.

14
00:00:28,448 --> 00:00:30,538
You must live.

15
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:36,498
Since his stomach was pumped in time

16
00:00:36,499 --> 00:00:38,659
- he will live.
- Okay.

17
00:00:38,658 --> 00:00:40,008
Rather than focusing
on his physical status

18
00:00:40,009 --> 00:00:42,959
he has to be mentally stable.

19
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:44,648
We understand.

20
00:00:44,648 --> 00:00:46,908
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

21
00:00:49,597 --> 00:00:51,757
When he wakes up

22
00:00:52,608 --> 00:00:55,138
we have to give him a hope to live.

23
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:58,068
In order to do that,
we have to find out the truth fast.

24
00:00:58,067 --> 00:01:00,857
But we have no idea
where this victim is.

25
00:01:00,857 --> 00:01:02,857
I agree.

26
00:01:02,857 --> 00:01:05,057
- Manager Gu.
- Yes?

27
00:01:05,057 --> 00:01:07,717
Contact the reporters now.

28
00:01:07,717 --> 00:01:09,007
Pardon?

29
00:01:09,007 --> 00:01:11,767
Tell them I will have an
interview at the company.

30
00:01:11,767 --> 00:01:14,107
What kind of interview will  it be?

31
00:01:16,706 --> 00:01:19,996
A can't miss opportunity.

32
00:01:24,436 --> 00:01:26,756
<i>You probably won't find him.</i>

33
00:01:26,756 --> 00:01:31,946
<i>I'm certain that he was
cast by Kang Dong Suk.</i>

34
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:35,055
As a representative of this company

35
00:01:35,056 --> 00:01:39,556
I'll share our position on this matter.

36
00:01:39,555 --> 00:01:42,335
As for the food poisoning case

37
00:01:42,334 --> 00:01:43,944
it was staged.

38
00:01:43,945 --> 00:01:45,735
Staged?

39
00:01:45,735 --> 00:01:49,265
By someone who was trying
to harm our company and Soon Jin Dairy

40
00:01:49,265 --> 00:01:50,755
it was his conspiracy.

41
00:01:50,754 --> 00:01:52,754
Do you have any grounds
for this allegation?

42
00:01:52,755 --> 00:01:53,895
If you say that without any evidence

43
00:01:53,895 --> 00:01:55,435
it could create more problems.

44
00:01:55,434 --> 00:01:58,914
I have something more
positive than evidence.

45
00:01:58,914 --> 00:02:00,224
Right now

46
00:02:00,224 --> 00:02:06,164
we have the person who collapsed
after drinking the rotten milk.

47
00:02:06,163 --> 00:02:08,383
What is he saying?

48
00:02:09,773 --> 00:02:12,553
He is under our care right now.

49
00:02:12,553 --> 00:02:17,573
He also confessed that this case
was orchestrated by someone.

50
00:02:17,572 --> 00:02:18,642
If that's true

51
00:02:18,642 --> 00:02:20,132
where is that person now?

52
00:02:20,133 --> 00:02:22,133
Due to his physical state

53
00:02:22,133 --> 00:02:24,783
an interview seems unlikely.

54
00:02:24,782 --> 00:02:28,862
But he will be out here tomorrow.

55
00:02:28,862 --> 00:02:31,712
He will come out and
explain everything.

56
00:02:31,712 --> 00:02:35,142
And the real conspirator
will be revealed!

57
00:02:35,142 --> 00:02:37,612
We will see you again
at this hour tomorrow.

58
00:02:42,551 --> 00:02:44,841
- Did you know about this?
- Not at all.

59
00:02:44,841 --> 00:02:47,171
What is he going to do?

60
00:02:47,942 --> 00:02:51,302
<i>[Food poisoning case was staged.]</i>

61
00:02:51,301 --> 00:02:52,771
What is this?

62
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:55,801
How did this happen?

63
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:57,171
I made sure of it, but...

64
00:02:57,171 --> 00:02:58,011
I'm sorry.

65
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,501
Did you confirm it yourself?

66
00:02:59,501 --> 00:03:01,501
I didn't.

67
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,910
Did you try to get in touch with him?

68
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:08,230
He was homeless,
so he didn't have contact information.

69
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,410
Are you saying you didn't
confirm anything yet?

70
00:03:11,409 --> 00:03:14,189
Why bother to confirm anything?

71
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,610
It's clear that you
were behind all this.

72
00:03:23,609 --> 00:03:24,979
Kim Ji Hyuk.

73
00:03:24,979 --> 00:03:27,929
You forced someone to drink
rotten milk, huh?

74
00:03:27,929 --> 00:03:31,489
People wouldn't do that
even to a homeless mutt.

75
00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:33,799
Is that something a person could do?

76
00:03:33,798 --> 00:03:36,308
What are you talking about?

77
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:39,419
Are you that afraid of me?

78
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:42,649
You had to do all that
to crush me, huh?

79
00:03:42,648 --> 00:03:44,958
I feel sorry for you.

80
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,598
You're out of your mind, aren't you?

81
00:03:46,598 --> 00:03:48,458
Just wait, Kang Dong Suk.

82
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:52,658
By tomorrow, everybody will know
what kind of person you are.

83
00:03:52,657 --> 00:03:56,487
Everybody will point
their fingers at you.

84
00:03:57,157 --> 00:03:59,467
even your servant.

85
00:04:02,407 --> 00:04:04,937
Look forward to tomorrow.

86
00:04:08,966 --> 00:04:11,446
Go now to check on the homeless guy.

87
00:04:11,446 --> 00:04:13,566
Yes, I will.

88
00:04:13,566 --> 00:04:16,276
Go confirm it with your own eyes.

89
00:04:17,146 --> 00:04:19,126
Yes, sir.

90
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:28,546
Yes, did you find his whereabout yet?

91
00:04:28,546 --> 00:04:30,016
Where is he?

92
00:04:30,015 --> 00:04:32,125
Got it.

93
00:04:58,224 --> 00:04:59,394
What happened?

94
00:04:59,394 --> 00:05:01,154
Did they really take him?

95
00:05:01,154 --> 00:05:02,824
They couldn't have
found him that easily.

96
00:05:02,823 --> 00:05:04,263
It's impossible.

97
00:05:04,264 --> 00:05:07,024
Even an excellent cop would
have taken a day or two...

98
00:05:07,024 --> 00:05:08,934
by any chance

99
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,223
would Kim Ji Hyuk?

100
00:05:21,193 --> 00:05:22,583
No one is here.

101
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:24,143
I hope I'm wrong.

102
00:05:24,142 --> 00:05:26,452
What do you think Kim Ji Hyuk did?

103
00:05:26,452 --> 00:05:28,092
Cops often use that...

104
00:05:28,093 --> 00:05:29,743
When there is no evidence or witness

105
00:05:29,743 --> 00:05:31,873
they bluff.

106
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,493
- Bluff?
- Yes.

107
00:05:33,492 --> 00:05:36,322
They say they have the witness
who will testify against you.

108
00:05:36,322 --> 00:05:38,012
- They bluff like that.
- Then what?

109
00:05:38,012 --> 00:05:40,572
Then the suspect gets nervous, so...

110
00:05:40,572 --> 00:05:43,082
he tries to find the witness, right?

111
00:05:43,082 --> 00:05:45,492
Then they follow him.

112
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:48,671
He's the one, right?

113
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:51,561
Yes, you're right.

114
00:05:51,561 --> 00:05:53,971
Wait a second.

115
00:05:55,761 --> 00:05:58,141
Damn it.

116
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:01,251
You suffered from food
poisoning, right?

117
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:14,030
Could you excuse us?

118
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:16,980
I have to talk to him privately.

119
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:26,330
Oh my.

120
00:06:26,329 --> 00:06:28,589
You, seriously.

121
00:06:40,739 --> 00:06:45,169
They made you drink the
rotten milk, didn't they?

122
00:06:45,168 --> 00:06:47,028
Think carefully.

123
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:50,309
They didn't treat you
like a human being.

124
00:06:50,308 --> 00:06:52,618
You were given money, right?

125
00:06:53,168 --> 00:06:57,518
They think they can do
anything with money.

126
00:06:59,007 --> 00:07:01,447
To you, I...

127
00:07:01,447 --> 00:07:04,847
I will offer you something you
really need rather than money.

128
00:07:06,838 --> 00:07:10,068
You're living apart from
your family, right?

129
00:07:10,067 --> 00:07:14,097
I will help you reunite your family.

130
00:07:14,097 --> 00:07:19,187
I will help you, so they will
never treat you like an animal again.

131
00:07:19,186 --> 00:07:21,426
I promise you that.

132
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:37,706
What's wrong?

133
00:07:39,596 --> 00:07:41,536
Are you okay?

134
00:07:41,535 --> 00:07:43,535
Hold on. I will go to the pharmacy.

135
00:08:18,803 --> 00:08:20,803
<i>[We welcome you to Hyung Sung Distributions]</i>

136
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:39,613
Yes, I received the money.

137
00:08:39,613 --> 00:08:41,203
By the way

138
00:08:41,202 --> 00:08:44,682
are the kids okay?

139
00:08:52,731 --> 00:08:55,101
Sir, time is up.

140
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:57,531
The reporters are outside.
What do you want me to do?

141
00:09:00,091 --> 00:09:02,651
Okay, I will make them leave.

142
00:09:02,651 --> 00:09:06,281
Gosh, it will make the image
of our company even worse.

143
00:09:06,281 --> 00:09:08,321
As for the reporters,
I will get back to you in a minute.

144
00:09:08,321 --> 00:09:11,081
That's not what I'm here for.

145
00:09:12,221 --> 00:09:14,531
What can I do for you?

146
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,750
By any chance, you...

147
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,860
Someone like me

148
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,970
can I be hired here?

149
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,229
Of course, you can.

150
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,640
You can work here.

151
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,330
with me, for the rest of your life.

152
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,950
Is it true what President
Kim said yesterday?

153
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:43,728
Yes.

154
00:09:43,729 --> 00:09:46,269
It is true.

155
00:09:46,269 --> 00:09:49,649
That day, someone came up to me.

156
00:09:49,649 --> 00:09:51,759
He handed over the milk.

157
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:55,658
He told me to drink it and go...

158
00:09:55,658 --> 00:09:59,888
He told me go buy one
more milk at the mart.

159
00:09:59,888 --> 00:10:04,388
I took the money and...

160
00:10:04,387 --> 00:10:07,267
did what he asked me to do.

161
00:10:07,268 --> 00:10:09,928
I'm sorry.

162
00:10:10,477 --> 00:10:17,777
I will go down to the police
station to report all this.

163
00:10:17,777 --> 00:10:19,097
Hey!

164
00:10:19,097 --> 00:10:20,297
Find the cop who will be
handling this case, and...

165
00:10:20,297 --> 00:10:22,877
bribe him right away.

166
00:10:28,397 --> 00:10:31,697
I heard that your son, Dong
Suk is getting married.

167
00:10:31,696 --> 00:10:33,316
Is it true?

168
00:10:33,316 --> 00:10:34,586
Yes.

169
00:10:34,586 --> 00:10:37,196
Oh my, which family is she from?

170
00:10:37,196 --> 00:10:39,406
I'm so curious.

171
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:41,815
Well, it's just that...

172
00:10:41,815 --> 00:10:43,815
Tell us, please.

173
00:10:43,816 --> 00:10:46,236
What powerful family is she from?

174
00:10:46,236 --> 00:10:47,656
Later.

175
00:10:47,655 --> 00:10:49,845
That's good.

176
00:10:50,585 --> 00:10:54,315
- Thank you.
- Sure.

177
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:57,425
Who is she?

178
00:10:57,425 --> 00:11:00,085
She is...

179
00:11:00,085 --> 00:11:04,285
Ah, she works at our company.

180
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:07,915
Let's cheers.

181
00:11:10,995 --> 00:11:14,275
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

182
00:11:16,434 --> 00:11:18,434
Thank you.

183
00:11:21,154 --> 00:11:23,814
This tastes so good.

184
00:11:23,814 --> 00:11:26,474
<i>The future I dreamed of</i>

185
00:11:26,473 --> 00:11:28,863
<i>was it becoming that woman?</i>

186
00:11:39,103 --> 00:11:40,893
Mi Ra.

187
00:11:42,132 --> 00:11:43,622
Honey.

188
00:11:43,623 --> 00:11:48,623
Honey, what's wrong?

189
00:11:48,622 --> 00:11:50,032
Wake up.

190
00:11:50,032 --> 00:11:51,402
Mi Ra, what are you doing?

191
00:11:51,402 --> 00:11:53,612
Call the doctor now!

192
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:56,252
Honey.

193
00:11:56,252 --> 00:11:59,062
Honey, what is it?

194
00:11:59,062 --> 00:12:01,192
Honey.

195
00:12:17,601 --> 00:12:20,381
Honey, wake up.

196
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,470
Honey.

197
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:23,470
Excuse me.

198
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,890
Mi Ra.

199
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,600
Is that safe?

200
00:12:37,979 --> 00:12:41,629
Did you find out who did it?

201
00:12:42,949 --> 00:12:45,559
I know who.

202
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:50,329
The victim turned himself
in and confessed.

203
00:12:50,329 --> 00:12:53,909
But the investigation
is going very slowly.

204
00:12:54,378 --> 00:12:58,258
They probably had something
to do with it too.

205
00:12:58,258 --> 00:13:00,168
They must have.

206
00:13:01,288 --> 00:13:06,308
They have money and power.

207
00:13:08,297 --> 00:13:10,187
I'm sorry.

208
00:13:10,188 --> 00:13:13,288
You were only trying to help us.

209
00:13:13,287 --> 00:13:15,727
But still it's been proven
that it was staged, so...

210
00:13:15,727 --> 00:13:17,517
things will recover soon.

211
00:13:17,518 --> 00:13:20,698
We will find a way too.

212
00:13:20,697 --> 00:13:22,737
Okay.

213
00:13:25,867 --> 00:13:30,367
It's this hard to live by my belief.

214
00:13:30,367 --> 00:13:32,707
Cheer up.

215
00:13:32,707 --> 00:13:35,757
And you have to survive till the end.

216
00:13:35,756 --> 00:13:38,746
Someone who is following
in your footstep

217
00:13:38,747 --> 00:13:41,727
will take your glory, so...

218
00:13:41,726 --> 00:13:44,456
please keep close eyes on him.

219
00:13:45,306 --> 00:13:47,716
I will.

220
00:13:47,716 --> 00:13:53,476
I will also look forward to that day.

221
00:13:57,085 --> 00:14:00,965
It appears that the artery
to the heart was blocked.

222
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,725
With surgery

223
00:14:02,725 --> 00:14:05,605
the artery has been cleared.

224
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:08,315
Since it was a minor operation

225
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:09,654
if you rest for about a week

226
00:14:09,654 --> 00:14:11,544
he will recover soon enough.

227
00:14:11,545 --> 00:14:13,585
Okay.

228
00:14:13,584 --> 00:14:17,234
I guess you got my heart after all.

229
00:14:17,234 --> 00:14:19,074
Fortunately, the emergency
treatment was done properly.

230
00:14:19,074 --> 00:14:21,074
That's why it was minor.

231
00:14:21,073 --> 00:14:23,503
Please pay more attention from now on.

232
00:14:23,503 --> 00:14:25,363
Who did the emergency treatment?

233
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,674
Why does that matter?

234
00:14:27,674 --> 00:14:30,034
What matters is that you're safe now.

235
00:14:30,713 --> 00:14:32,923
It was Mi Ra.

236
00:14:33,443 --> 00:14:35,503
It was?

237
00:14:36,893 --> 00:14:38,813
Mi Ra.

238
00:14:38,813 --> 00:14:40,973
Yes, sir.

239
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:53,873
Thank you.

240
00:14:53,872 --> 00:14:55,312
It's okay.

241
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:58,142
I only did what I had to do.

242
00:15:01,922 --> 00:15:05,382
Why does my father want you
to be the chief secretary?

243
00:15:05,382 --> 00:15:06,252
After we get married

244
00:15:06,251 --> 00:15:08,581
I was going to have you stay home.

245
00:15:08,581 --> 00:15:11,341
Don't you think my
talent will be wasted?

246
00:15:11,342 --> 00:15:13,502
Your talent?

247
00:15:15,421 --> 00:15:17,981
You did a good job as
a nurse this time.

248
00:15:17,981 --> 00:15:20,961
But it's different working
in the business world.

249
00:15:21,531 --> 00:15:23,791
I want to do it.

250
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,160
It's important that we
get married, but...

251
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,040
I want to succeed in my career too.

252
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:32,050
Let me do it, please.

253
00:15:34,999 --> 00:15:36,439
Just because I don't like it

254
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,110
can I make you do what I want?

255
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:40,570
It's an order from President Kang.

256
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:43,210
I can't just go against it.

257
00:15:43,529 --> 00:15:46,359
I will do my best.

258
00:15:47,949 --> 00:15:50,409
Thank you, anyway.

259
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:53,249
You're saving many of
my family members.

260
00:15:58,338 --> 00:16:01,148
Earlier a customer
spilled coffee there.

261
00:16:01,148 --> 00:16:03,148
Scrub there hard.

262
00:16:05,748 --> 00:16:08,878
By the way, why do I have to work here?

263
00:16:08,877 --> 00:16:10,967
Whose house do you live in now?

264
00:16:10,968 --> 00:16:12,778
I'm on it.

265
00:16:14,398 --> 00:16:17,748
Briefly I thought she was an angel...

266
00:16:17,748 --> 00:16:20,288
People don't change, okay?

267
00:16:30,006 --> 00:16:31,216
Hey.

268
00:16:31,216 --> 00:16:33,086
I think this has been more
than enough for our rent.

269
00:16:33,087 --> 00:16:34,747
- Money for food.
- Money for food?

270
00:16:34,746 --> 00:16:36,216
You're unemployed now, aren't you?

271
00:16:36,216 --> 00:16:40,016
Kim Ji Hyuk doesn't
have any money either.

272
00:16:40,016 --> 00:16:42,576
Hey, you said you'd be nice
to me for the rest of your life.

273
00:16:42,576 --> 00:16:44,786
Maybe I've been too nice to you.

274
00:16:44,786 --> 00:16:46,606
You're being cheeky.

275
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:47,746
Hey.

276
00:16:47,746 --> 00:16:51,226
You have to at least
feed us to make us work.

277
00:16:55,426 --> 00:16:58,856
Wow, this was fast.

278
00:16:58,855 --> 00:17:00,325
This will be added to our
breakfast menu, so...

279
00:17:00,326 --> 00:17:02,066
it's important to make it fast.

280
00:17:02,065 --> 00:17:04,005
It's nutritious and simple.

281
00:17:04,005 --> 00:17:05,365
- What do you think?
- Why?

282
00:17:05,365 --> 00:17:08,825
We're being your guinea pigs now?

283
00:17:08,824 --> 00:17:11,034
Well, if this is the
guinea pig you need

284
00:17:11,034 --> 00:17:12,624
we're always available.

285
00:17:12,624 --> 00:17:14,094
I can't say much about you, but...

286
00:17:14,095 --> 00:17:15,385
you sure know how to make a sandwich.

287
00:17:15,385 --> 00:17:18,165
I was often home alone
when I was little.

288
00:17:18,164 --> 00:17:19,754
It was too much to make
other stuff, so...

289
00:17:19,754 --> 00:17:21,674
I always made sandwiches.

290
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:22,764
Why would you make it yourself?

291
00:17:22,763 --> 00:17:24,083
You can have it made for you.

292
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:27,264
I'm not one of those princesses
who are given everything.

293
00:17:27,264 --> 00:17:29,124
I'm an independent princess.

294
00:17:29,124 --> 00:17:33,424
I'm a princess who has the looks and
the personality at the same time.

295
00:17:33,423 --> 00:17:36,333
By the way, how did the
food poisoning case go?

296
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:37,403
It went okay.

297
00:17:37,403 --> 00:17:40,903
But things are not the same as before.

298
00:17:40,903 --> 00:17:43,443
Shall I help?

299
00:17:43,443 --> 00:17:44,413
It's okay.

300
00:17:44,413 --> 00:17:46,173
You can just make
sandwiches like this, okay?

301
00:17:46,173 --> 00:17:47,493
When you try to help

302
00:17:47,492 --> 00:17:48,582
you may make it worse.

303
00:17:48,582 --> 00:17:50,772
You just don't know much about me yet.

304
00:17:50,773 --> 00:17:53,263
I don't get involved because
I'm not interested, but...

305
00:17:53,262 --> 00:17:54,722
When it comes to this

306
00:17:54,722 --> 00:17:57,832
mine is much smarter than Dong Suk's.

307
00:18:06,331 --> 00:18:07,821
You can eat this anywhere.

308
00:18:07,821 --> 00:18:09,641
I'm at Hyun Sung Mart today.

309
00:18:09,642 --> 00:18:11,772
I will have a sandwich again today.

310
00:18:11,772 --> 00:18:14,532
With a sandwich, we can't
go without milk, right?

311
00:18:14,531 --> 00:18:17,691
If so, I will eat it now.

312
00:18:27,111 --> 00:18:28,571
You can eat this anywhere.

313
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:30,570
I'm at Hyun Sung Mart today.

314
00:18:30,571 --> 00:18:33,221
I will have a sandwich again today.

315
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:36,080
With a sandwich, you
can't go without milk.

316
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,290
If so, I will drink it now.

317
00:18:41,569 --> 00:18:44,209
Oh my.

318
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:46,270
It's good.

319
00:18:46,269 --> 00:18:47,889
She's such a character.

320
00:18:47,889 --> 00:18:49,449
She's cute and all, but...

321
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:51,860
she's a bit weird...

322
00:18:52,529 --> 00:18:54,649
How do you like it?

323
00:18:54,649 --> 00:18:55,669
This?

324
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:57,899
According to the comments uploaded

325
00:18:57,898 --> 00:18:59,618
because of this segment

326
00:18:59,619 --> 00:19:01,929
Soon Jin milk is getting good
reviews on the Internet.

327
00:19:01,949 --> 00:19:03,049
- Is it?
- Yes.

328
00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:06,879
Then, are our sales having the same...

329
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,539
Our sales are going up slowly.

330
00:19:08,538 --> 00:19:09,658
Actually

331
00:19:09,658 --> 00:19:12,218
once you leave a bad
image on the consumers

332
00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:13,488
regardless whether it's true or not

333
00:19:13,488 --> 00:19:14,648
it takes a long time
to recover from it.

334
00:19:14,648 --> 00:19:16,968
I understand. Alright then.

335
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:20,048
Sir.

336
00:19:20,047 --> 00:19:21,957
It was the Justice Department.

337
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:26,658
They want us to send our
revival plan again.

338
00:19:26,657 --> 00:19:29,887
I have a feeling that it was
because of the recent case.

339
00:19:31,427 --> 00:19:33,467
By when?

340
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:37,787
You're making sure the others
don't think otherwise, right?

341
00:19:37,786 --> 00:19:38,536
Of course.

342
00:19:38,537 --> 00:19:39,877
You have to do a good job.

343
00:19:39,877 --> 00:19:41,517
If you do well, the
others will follow you.

344
00:19:41,516 --> 00:19:42,666
Don't worry.

345
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:45,846
Even though we won't
be related as in-laws

346
00:19:45,846 --> 00:19:48,506
I still think of you as my own brother.

347
00:19:48,506 --> 00:19:50,046
not blood-related...

348
00:19:50,046 --> 00:19:53,816
just like the way you treated
that scam artist as your own brother.

349
00:19:54,165 --> 00:19:58,045
Ah, sorry. It was a joke.

350
00:19:58,046 --> 00:20:00,486
But what do we do?

351
00:20:00,485 --> 00:20:02,245
This time, between us...

352
00:20:02,245 --> 00:20:04,245
there will be a cutthroat competition.

353
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:06,845
Are you talking about a bid over
petroleum public corporations?

354
00:20:06,846 --> 00:20:08,306
Whoever gets it

355
00:20:08,305 --> 00:20:09,605
the one who gets it will...

356
00:20:09,605 --> 00:20:12,635
have their stocks go
up two or three times.

357
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:16,115
Alright.

358
00:20:16,115 --> 00:20:19,395
I'll compete with you fair and square.

359
00:20:19,395 --> 00:20:21,605
only with my skills.

360
00:20:21,604 --> 00:20:23,794
Before the committee
reviews our revival plan

361
00:20:23,794 --> 00:20:26,274
we have to make some
noticeable progress.

362
00:20:26,274 --> 00:20:27,914
If we show up empty-handed

363
00:20:27,914 --> 00:20:31,254
we will walk out of there
with their demands only.

364
00:20:31,254 --> 00:20:32,464
So that means...

365
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:34,054
we have to make a progress...

366
00:20:34,053 --> 00:20:35,643
to be able to reject their demands.

367
00:20:35,644 --> 00:20:37,684
With our current products
from small companies

368
00:20:37,683 --> 00:20:38,683
we can only do so much, right?

369
00:20:38,683 --> 00:20:39,773
Well...

370
00:20:39,773 --> 00:20:42,283
we are okay with groceries
and general goods.

371
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:43,253
The problem is...

372
00:20:43,254 --> 00:20:45,464
the bulky items such
as home appliances.

373
00:20:45,463 --> 00:20:48,203
It's s field that is dominated
by large companies.

374
00:20:48,203 --> 00:20:52,173
Dong Suk is blocking our path...

375
00:20:52,173 --> 00:20:54,113
There seems to be no
way to go about it.

376
00:20:54,112 --> 00:20:56,552
Anyhow, we have to loosen the
chokehold from the big companies.

377
00:20:56,552 --> 00:20:59,782
Other than that, there is no other way.

378
00:21:02,662 --> 00:21:06,212
This is a copy of the bid document
that Dae Sam is preparing.

379
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:13,321
Good work.

380
00:21:13,322 --> 00:21:14,622
Hand this over to the
Planning Department.

381
00:21:14,622 --> 00:21:15,362
Based on this

382
00:21:15,361 --> 00:21:18,051
tell them to prepare our bid document.

383
00:21:22,741 --> 00:21:25,151
<i>Who is stopping the supply
from large companies</i>

384
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:26,741
<i>it's the members of the Owners Club.</i>

385
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,740
The leader is Kang Dong Suk, but...

386
00:21:28,741 --> 00:21:31,371
the most influential person
to the members is...

387
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:34,300
the vice president, Moon
Myung Ho of Dae Sam.

388
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:38,700
Then what we need to do is have
Moon Myung Ho turn to our side, huh?

389
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,660
- Is it even possible?
- Well...

390
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,550
It's just that...

391
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:45,980
He was acting like a
bastard before, so...

392
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:48,860
I beat him up once before...

393
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,550
Don't worry.

394
00:21:50,549 --> 00:21:52,419
When he thinks it's beneficial

395
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:55,280
he won't care about the past.

396
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:56,689
One second.

397
00:21:56,689 --> 00:21:58,039
According to you

398
00:21:58,039 --> 00:22:01,119
there is a possibility that we can
have Moon Myung Ho turn to our side?

399
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:04,499
Kang Dong Suk got a hold of a very
important bid document of Dae Sam.

400
00:22:04,499 --> 00:22:06,499
If we can show him the document

401
00:22:06,499 --> 00:22:09,489
there is a possibility that
he might switch his side.

402
00:22:09,489 --> 00:22:11,779
When he was about to get screwed

403
00:22:11,778 --> 00:22:14,018
it will look as though we helped him.

404
00:22:14,018 --> 00:22:14,588
That's right.

405
00:22:14,589 --> 00:22:16,699
By the way, Dong Suk...

406
00:22:16,698 --> 00:22:18,218
isn't he close to Myung Ho?

407
00:22:18,218 --> 00:22:19,808
Why did he sneak out the document?

408
00:22:19,808 --> 00:22:22,068
In their world, a friend means...

409
00:22:22,068 --> 00:22:25,098
just a closer enemy.

410
00:22:25,467 --> 00:22:29,377
Actually, they are the same.

411
00:22:29,377 --> 00:22:31,737
Based on the information
that he sneaked out

412
00:22:31,737 --> 00:22:34,567
Hyun Sung will also
prepare a bid document.

413
00:22:34,568 --> 00:22:37,128
If we get a hold of it and
hand it over to Moon Myung Ho

414
00:22:37,127 --> 00:22:40,457
we'll stopped them from
getting screwed.

415
00:22:40,457 --> 00:22:42,867
With that gesture

416
00:22:42,867 --> 00:22:45,927
we can make a deal with Moon Myung Ho.

417
00:22:50,326 --> 00:22:54,326
Are you still there to
help me out this way?

418
00:22:58,326 --> 00:23:01,066
Don't put yourself in
danger unnecessarily.

419
00:23:01,066 --> 00:23:04,936
If Dong Suk or Manager Do finds out

420
00:23:06,905 --> 00:23:08,935
Just walk away.

421
00:23:08,935 --> 00:23:12,045
We won't need your help.

422
00:23:12,045 --> 00:23:13,935
You do need my help.

423
00:23:13,935 --> 00:23:15,105
Only if I stay there

424
00:23:15,105 --> 00:23:16,645
you can win.

425
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,705
If I have to use you,
it's not the victory I would want.

426
00:23:18,705 --> 00:23:20,745
Yes, you have to win.

427
00:23:20,744 --> 00:23:23,084
You must win, no matter what.

428
00:23:24,474 --> 00:23:27,134
It's for my late father.

429
00:23:27,135 --> 00:23:29,415
And...

430
00:23:29,414 --> 00:23:31,784
And what?

431
00:23:42,194 --> 00:23:45,254
Oh man...

432
00:23:45,773 --> 00:23:51,263
I know that it's not the right
time to say this, but...

433
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:55,763
there was a time when I liked
someone very much in the past.

434
00:23:55,762 --> 00:23:58,822
I'm telling you this
as a friend, but...

435
00:23:59,362 --> 00:24:03,812
If you have feelings for
me right now by any chance...

436
00:24:03,812 --> 00:24:06,402
You have a lot to do right now.

437
00:24:06,402 --> 00:24:08,262
Focus on your work now.

438
00:24:08,262 --> 00:24:10,372
Do I work every single moment?

439
00:24:10,372 --> 00:24:12,862
Work will eventually end some day.

440
00:24:12,862 --> 00:24:15,442
So, you also...

441
00:24:15,442 --> 00:24:17,442
about me

442
00:24:17,442 --> 00:24:20,472
if you give me a small hint...

443
00:24:25,761 --> 00:24:28,021
What are you doing?

444
00:24:28,021 --> 00:24:30,021
Are you cheating?

445
00:24:30,611 --> 00:24:32,101
What do you mean I'm cheating?

446
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,510
You and I are living together.

447
00:24:33,511 --> 00:24:35,051
If you see another woman other than
the woman you're living with

448
00:24:35,051 --> 00:24:37,121
it mean you're cheating, no?

449
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,380
You moved yourself in.

450
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:41,040
Do I live with you because I want to?

451
00:24:41,041 --> 00:24:42,861
I will get going now.

452
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:45,240
See you later.

453
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,770
Mi Ra!

454
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:52,800
You still have feelings for her?

455
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,990
Mi Ra will marry my brother.

456
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:56,330
- No.
- Yes.

457
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:57,550
Absolutely not.

458
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:58,890
Do you want to bet?

459
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:00,460
If she marries my brother

460
00:25:00,459 --> 00:25:02,769
you will become mine, okay?

461
00:25:02,769 --> 00:25:03,759
If she doesn't marry him

462
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:05,759
you're still mine.

463
00:25:06,449 --> 00:25:08,679
What a psycho.

464
00:25:11,958 --> 00:25:14,548
- I'm a psycho, so what?
- Hey.

465
00:25:14,548 --> 00:25:17,008
- Seriously.
- You did wrong.

466
00:25:23,218 --> 00:25:26,678
The bid document is prepared
at the headquarter.

467
00:25:26,678 --> 00:25:27,838
Once it's complete

468
00:25:27,838 --> 00:25:29,708
it gets handed over to the president.

469
00:25:29,707 --> 00:25:32,187
The minute the document
is handed over to him

470
00:25:32,187 --> 00:25:35,767
it gets stored in the company safe.

471
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:39,627
Then no one gets access
to that document.

472
00:25:39,627 --> 00:25:42,457
Are you saying it's impossible
to get a hold of it?

473
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:43,597
No.

474
00:25:43,597 --> 00:25:45,807
it's not completely impossible.

475
00:25:45,807 --> 00:25:47,157
From the Planning Department
on the third floor

476
00:25:47,156 --> 00:25:49,366
the document gets delivered to the
president's office on the 27th floor.

477
00:25:49,366 --> 00:25:50,976
That's the window.

478
00:25:50,976 --> 00:25:52,226
It's five minutes at most.

479
00:25:52,226 --> 00:25:53,716
Is it even possible?

480
00:25:53,717 --> 00:25:55,927
Not to be caught after
sneaking out the document

481
00:25:55,926 --> 00:25:57,546
we will have to make a copy
and return it during that time.

482
00:25:57,547 --> 00:26:00,027
No way. It's nonsense.

483
00:26:00,026 --> 00:26:01,296
Isn't it?

484
00:26:01,296 --> 00:26:04,576
If it's from the third
floor to the 27th floor...

485
00:26:04,576 --> 00:26:07,406
they will use the elevator for sure.

486
00:26:09,395 --> 00:26:10,815
This much will be alright, right?

487
00:26:10,815 --> 00:26:11,955
It's good.

488
00:26:11,955 --> 00:26:13,545
That amount will work.

489
00:26:13,545 --> 00:26:15,855
Let's do it that way.

490
00:26:26,295 --> 00:26:28,385
From now on

491
00:26:28,384 --> 00:26:32,214
hand over all the documents
to me the Chief Secretary.

492
00:26:34,524 --> 00:26:37,354
Do you have something to say?

493
00:26:40,684 --> 00:26:42,154
Thank you.

494
00:26:42,153 --> 00:26:44,313
Let's go.

495
00:27:30,172 --> 00:27:31,342
I'm sorry.

496
00:27:31,342 --> 00:27:33,342
Please hold the elevator for a bit.

497
00:27:33,341 --> 00:27:35,781
I have things to load.

498
00:27:36,531 --> 00:27:38,221
Thank you.

499
00:27:38,221 --> 00:27:39,191
What are you doing?

500
00:27:39,191 --> 00:27:41,551
You can't even lift that by yourself?

501
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:53,060
Come out.

502
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,780
- Can you move to the side, please?
- Sorry.

503
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:05,160
The director asked me to
move the stuff, so...

504
00:28:24,718 --> 00:28:27,458
Get off.

505
00:28:30,338 --> 00:28:31,578
What's gotten into you today?

506
00:28:31,578 --> 00:28:33,098
Are you not feeling well today?

507
00:28:33,098 --> 00:28:35,098
I might not be fully
recovered from last night.

508
00:28:35,098 --> 00:28:37,618
- Lift it.
- I'm sorry.

509
00:28:37,618 --> 00:28:39,858
Lift it.

510
00:29:16,985 --> 00:29:18,795
What's going on?

511
00:29:20,485 --> 00:29:21,685
What is it?

512
00:29:21,685 --> 00:29:22,925
- Did you press something?
- No, I didn't.

513
00:29:22,925 --> 00:29:23,995
Did I press something by accident?

514
00:29:23,995 --> 00:29:25,995
- It's okay.
- That's right.

515
00:29:25,995 --> 00:29:27,025
Your baby just had his
first birthday, right?

516
00:29:27,045 --> 00:29:28,095
Yes.

517
00:29:28,095 --> 00:29:30,705
Wow, it feels like it was only
yesterday that the baby was born.

518
00:29:30,705 --> 00:29:32,705
- How time flies.
- Excuse me for a sec.

519
00:29:32,705 --> 00:29:33,935
- Something is wrong?
- No.

520
00:29:33,935 --> 00:29:35,795
- I didn't climb up there.
- I just need to check something.

521
00:30:17,502 --> 00:30:19,862
Thank you.

522
00:30:19,862 --> 00:30:22,122
Manager Do, you may go.

523
00:30:22,202 --> 00:30:24,312
Yes, sir.

524
00:30:37,091 --> 00:30:38,801
How does it look?

525
00:30:38,801 --> 00:30:41,191
Me sitting up here?

526
00:30:41,191 --> 00:30:43,501
You look good.

527
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:46,080
When my father isn't well

528
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,840
shall I ask him to hand
this position over to me?

529
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,480
It might be too soon.

530
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,310
Your father is still in good health.

531
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:56,790
And he doesn't seem to
want to step down yet.

532
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:59,480
Then I will make him step down.

533
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:01,960
What do you mean?

534
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:08,179
Mi Ra.

535
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:12,050
there are times I can't control myself.

536
00:31:12,049 --> 00:31:16,999
It's probably because
of this lousy heart.

537
00:31:17,029 --> 00:31:19,959
When my original heart was switched

538
00:31:19,959 --> 00:31:24,929
I think the person who I am
might have been switched too.

539
00:31:26,448 --> 00:31:30,718
I might have lost who I am
along with my heart.

540
00:31:37,578 --> 00:31:40,438
By any chance

541
00:31:40,438 --> 00:31:43,738
if I cross a line I'm
not supposed to cross

542
00:31:43,737 --> 00:31:46,477
you should stop me.

543
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:51,097
It's only you who can stop
me when I'm like that.

544
00:31:56,516 --> 00:31:58,526
<i>Dong Suk.</i>

545
00:31:58,527 --> 00:32:03,727
<i>you've gone too far for me to stop you.</i>

546
00:32:03,726 --> 00:32:06,136
What did you want to see me about?

547
00:32:06,136 --> 00:32:08,136
Frankly

548
00:32:08,136 --> 00:32:10,456
I don't have good feelings about you.

549
00:32:10,457 --> 00:32:11,977
About the merchandise
from the big companies

550
00:32:11,976 --> 00:32:15,126
let Hyun Sung Mart sell them again.

551
00:32:17,116 --> 00:32:18,636
Why?

552
00:32:18,636 --> 00:32:21,116
Why should I do that?

553
00:32:31,705 --> 00:32:33,045
When you see this

554
00:32:33,045 --> 00:32:35,935
you may change your attitude toward me.

555
00:32:38,644 --> 00:32:39,834
What is this?

556
00:32:39,834 --> 00:32:42,224
We snuck it out from Hyun Sung.

557
00:32:42,224 --> 00:32:44,534
It's the bid document of Dae Sam.

558
00:32:44,904 --> 00:32:46,624
With what evidence, can
you make such claims?

559
00:32:46,624 --> 00:32:49,404
If you see the bid document
prepared by Hyun Sung

560
00:32:49,404 --> 00:32:51,264
you will know for sure.

561
00:32:51,264 --> 00:32:52,784
Based on your document

562
00:32:52,783 --> 00:32:55,043
they offered a little
more on their terms.

563
00:32:55,043 --> 00:32:57,923
You're trying to cause a dispute
between Hyun Sung and Dae Sam, huh?

564
00:32:57,923 --> 00:32:59,743
You will make that decision.

565
00:32:59,743 --> 00:33:02,373
If you don't want, don't check.

566
00:33:03,293 --> 00:33:06,703
Any evidence this is
not a trick to get me?

567
00:33:06,703 --> 00:33:09,313
If that confirms to be a lie

568
00:33:09,313 --> 00:33:12,243
you can always stop the
merchandise again.

569
00:33:12,243 --> 00:33:13,583
You are in a bind, aren't you?

570
00:33:13,583 --> 00:33:14,603
Are you going to do it or not?

571
00:33:14,603 --> 00:33:17,213
Okay.

572
00:33:18,433 --> 00:33:20,293
By any chance

573
00:33:20,292 --> 00:33:23,402
did you not think I might
go tell on Dong Suk?

574
00:33:24,592 --> 00:33:27,302
That's not who you are.

575
00:33:34,241 --> 00:33:37,091
Kang Dong Suk.

576
00:33:37,092 --> 00:33:39,902
He's more than capable of doing it.

577
00:33:52,301 --> 00:33:55,811
Yes, I understand.

578
00:33:55,811 --> 00:33:57,811
Thank you.

579
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:04,780
Most big companies contacted
us to send the merchandise to us.

580
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:06,380
Okay!

581
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:08,160
We're almost there.

582
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,400
No, we still have a lot
of huddles to overcome.

583
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:13,429
First, we have to come up
with the revival plan.

584
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:15,100
- Let's gather around.
- Sure.

585
00:34:15,099 --> 00:34:17,159
This is what I have so far, so...

586
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,669
this may not work.

587
00:34:18,669 --> 00:34:20,839
Wait a sec.

588
00:34:20,839 --> 00:34:25,109
Finally, it looks like
they are starting to work.

589
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:29,909
You gather all our resources and...

590
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:32,489
buy as much Hyun Sung stocks.

591
00:34:32,488 --> 00:34:34,808
The price is at the bottom, so...

592
00:34:34,808 --> 00:34:36,668
you should be able to buy them all.

593
00:34:36,668 --> 00:34:38,408
Yes, sir.

594
00:34:39,128 --> 00:34:43,898
Let's now hear people call me
the head of a company.

595
00:34:56,107 --> 00:34:58,437
Weird.

596
00:34:58,437 --> 00:35:01,397
Jin Ah left me because of you.

597
00:35:01,397 --> 00:35:05,247
It was my first time to be
punched by anyone in my life.

598
00:35:05,246 --> 00:35:08,036
There is something about
you that draws me.

599
00:35:08,457 --> 00:35:10,197
Is this what they call
opposite attraction?

600
00:35:10,196 --> 00:35:12,406
I'm not doing this for you.

601
00:35:12,406 --> 00:35:16,036
The person, Kang Dong Suk who
even betrays a friend...

602
00:35:16,036 --> 00:35:18,036
is what I wanted to show you.

603
00:35:18,036 --> 00:35:22,496
Usually, enemy's enemies
become friends.

604
00:35:36,964 --> 00:35:39,394
Are you feeling okay?

605
00:35:39,394 --> 00:35:42,004
Yes, I'm all better.

606
00:35:42,005 --> 00:35:44,695
I just took a few more
days off to just rest.

607
00:35:44,695 --> 00:35:46,555
Please wait a little bit.

608
00:35:46,554 --> 00:35:47,844
It's after rush hour, so...

609
00:35:47,844 --> 00:35:50,334
you should be home soon.

610
00:35:52,025 --> 00:35:55,155
- Mi Ra.
- Yes?

611
00:35:55,154 --> 00:35:58,754
There is a place I want to stop by.

612
00:35:58,754 --> 00:35:59,904
Where?

613
00:35:59,904 --> 00:36:02,334
I want you to come with me too.

614
00:36:02,334 --> 00:36:06,014
She hates me coming, so...

615
00:36:06,014 --> 00:36:08,174
I will use you as an excuse.

616
00:36:08,173 --> 00:36:10,783
Dong Suk will show up soon.

617
00:36:10,783 --> 00:36:13,443
You stay with your heads
down, no matter what.

618
00:36:13,443 --> 00:36:16,523
I will handle it, okay?

619
00:36:17,143 --> 00:36:21,173
Besides, he's not himself right now.

620
00:36:21,173 --> 00:36:24,133
As you already know it,
he's doing something unprofitable.

621
00:36:24,132 --> 00:36:25,522
If he wants to go down,
he should go down by himself.

622
00:36:25,522 --> 00:36:28,082
Why is he bringing us all to it?

623
00:36:28,082 --> 00:36:30,082
Don't you think?

624
00:36:30,082 --> 00:36:33,132
Mi Ra was asking about you, so...

625
00:36:33,132 --> 00:36:34,692
she will be your sister-in-law.

626
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:38,222
I thought she should know
about your store at least.

627
00:36:38,221 --> 00:36:40,581
Are you really going
to marry my brother?

628
00:36:40,581 --> 00:36:42,891
Of course, our families have
already been introduced.

629
00:36:42,891 --> 00:36:45,031
I was sad that you missed it.

630
00:36:45,031 --> 00:36:47,421
Mi Ra, make sure you marry my brother.

631
00:36:47,421 --> 00:36:48,341
Okay?

632
00:36:48,341 --> 00:36:49,881
That's what I really want.

633
00:36:49,881 --> 00:36:52,881
He needs someone like you.

634
00:36:53,731 --> 00:36:55,721
Okay.

635
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:59,220
Jin Ah, can I have a sandwich you make?

636
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,610
I've only been having
hospital food lately.

637
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:03,900
Now I have a craving for it.

638
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:06,680
Hospital food?

639
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:09,390
Do you hate me that much?

640
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:12,420
Can you sit down, so I can see you?

641
00:37:15,829 --> 00:37:17,859
What was wrong?

642
00:37:17,859 --> 00:37:19,859
It wasn't serious.

643
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:22,510
I passed out for a
short period of time.

644
00:37:23,229 --> 00:37:25,119
By the way

645
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:26,509
after I passed out

646
00:37:26,509 --> 00:37:28,279
you were the one I
wanted to see the most.

647
00:37:28,278 --> 00:37:29,448
What are you doing seriously?

648
00:37:29,448 --> 00:37:32,148
I don't want to see you.

649
00:37:32,148 --> 00:37:34,858
Do you like him that much?

650
00:37:34,859 --> 00:37:38,369
so much that you would
leave your parents?

651
00:37:38,368 --> 00:37:40,698
Yes.

652
00:37:41,198 --> 00:37:42,988
Do you?

653
00:37:42,988 --> 00:37:45,478
I might be being punished.

654
00:37:46,448 --> 00:37:51,468
Honestly, I was trying to take
away something precious from him.

655
00:37:51,468 --> 00:37:55,638
That's why he's taking away
something precious to me.

656
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,487
Who started it?

657
00:38:04,487 --> 00:38:06,057
Dong Suk.

658
00:38:06,057 --> 00:38:08,117
It should be enough.

659
00:38:08,117 --> 00:38:08,807
Was it you?

660
00:38:08,807 --> 00:38:10,447
I told them to stop.

661
00:38:10,447 --> 00:38:11,347
What?

662
00:38:11,347 --> 00:38:13,037
We were all fed up.

663
00:38:13,036 --> 00:38:15,426
Business shouldn't be
run based on emotions.

664
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:17,856
I told you that I'd pay
for all your loss.

665
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:19,946
We agreed to do it not
for the money, but...

666
00:38:19,946 --> 00:38:22,086
for you.

667
00:38:22,656 --> 00:38:24,546
Dong Suk.

668
00:38:24,545 --> 00:38:26,335
You're our leader.

669
00:38:26,336 --> 00:38:28,766
You're a model that we learn from.

670
00:38:28,766 --> 00:38:32,546
So you don't destroying that image...

671
00:38:32,546 --> 00:38:35,086
this is where it ends.

672
00:38:37,785 --> 00:38:41,365
Do you guys agree to this?

673
00:38:47,635 --> 00:38:49,375
Alright then.

674
00:38:49,374 --> 00:38:51,234
Thank you for your support.

675
00:38:51,235 --> 00:38:53,095
We will stop right here then.

676
00:38:53,094 --> 00:38:57,794
Obviously, you're our leader forever.

677
00:39:06,244 --> 00:39:09,274
Mi Ra brought you home safe, right?

678
00:39:09,273 --> 00:39:11,593
Yes.

679
00:39:13,574 --> 00:39:15,464
Take a few more days to rest.

680
00:39:15,463 --> 00:39:18,453
I will take care of the company.

681
00:39:18,453 --> 00:39:22,973
How is it going with the bidding
for petroleum public corporation?

682
00:39:23,673 --> 00:39:28,293
We received the document from
the Planning Department.

683
00:39:28,292 --> 00:39:29,212
I looked through it and...

684
00:39:29,212 --> 00:39:32,912
it looks like it will
come to us this time.

685
00:39:33,832 --> 00:39:38,132
Since I collapsed

686
00:39:38,132 --> 00:39:41,732
I will step down and appoint
you as the president soon.

687
00:39:42,331 --> 00:39:44,791
If the bidding for petroleum public
corporation comes through

688
00:39:44,791 --> 00:39:47,651
it will be a good excuse
to give you that position.

689
00:39:47,652 --> 00:39:50,332
You will have to recover
from your mistakes too.

690
00:39:50,331 --> 00:39:52,521
All the other bidders
are insignificant.

691
00:39:52,521 --> 00:39:54,521
It comes down to a bidding
between us and Dae Sam.

692
00:39:54,521 --> 00:39:56,081
Against Dae Sam

693
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,740
I'm positive I can win.

694
00:39:57,741 --> 00:39:59,501
Don't underestimate them.

695
00:39:59,501 --> 00:40:00,371
If you fail

696
00:40:00,371 --> 00:40:01,991
not only your position at the company

697
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:04,800
but also Hyun Sung Energy
will be traumatized.

698
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:08,730
You know that our company isn't
at the top of our game now, right?

699
00:40:08,731 --> 00:40:12,281
I'm saying that this bidding
will most definitely come to us.

700
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,960
Don't worry.

701
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,820
How is it going with Hyun Sung

702
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:20,710
Distribution that Ji Hyuk
is in charge of?

703
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:23,409
I'm paying attention.

704
00:40:23,659 --> 00:40:27,089
I thought about it and...

705
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:30,079
what if we leave him alone?

706
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:30,769
Father.

707
00:40:30,769 --> 00:40:32,409
If this deal comes through

708
00:40:32,408 --> 00:40:34,868
it will take care of that as well.

709
00:40:34,868 --> 00:40:37,278
Just let him live.

710
00:40:37,278 --> 00:40:39,468
We will focus on Hyun Sung Energy.

711
00:40:39,468 --> 00:40:43,048
We won't have to waste
our resources there.

712
00:40:43,048 --> 00:40:45,288
I can never do that.

713
00:40:45,288 --> 00:40:47,448
My pride won't allow it.

714
00:40:47,448 --> 00:40:48,618
Your pride?

715
00:40:48,618 --> 00:40:51,328
Apart from my pride

716
00:40:51,328 --> 00:40:54,708
he's like a ticking bomb for us.

717
00:40:57,087 --> 00:40:58,807
Once he gains power

718
00:40:58,808 --> 00:41:00,298
we will explode.

719
00:41:00,298 --> 00:41:02,008
Boom!

720
00:41:02,007 --> 00:41:06,087
He and our family can
never coexist together.

721
00:41:06,087 --> 00:41:08,087
Then what shall we do?

722
00:41:08,087 --> 00:41:10,987
We have to crush him,
so he won't be able to get up again.

723
00:41:10,987 --> 00:41:13,417
Don't you think so, father?

724
00:41:15,006 --> 00:41:17,746
Good night.

725
00:41:27,036 --> 00:41:29,596
When did this begin?

726
00:41:29,596 --> 00:41:32,576
Why is it getting more twisted
as the time goes by?

727
00:41:32,576 --> 00:41:34,916
Damn it.

728
00:41:39,265 --> 00:41:41,405
Did you see your father?

729
00:41:41,406 --> 00:41:43,406
Yes.

730
00:41:49,335 --> 00:41:52,365
What is it? Is everything okay?

731
00:41:53,654 --> 00:41:56,884
I may have underestimated Kim Ji Hyuk.

732
00:41:56,884 --> 00:42:00,294
I've been treating him like
a little bug all this time.

733
00:42:00,714 --> 00:42:04,014
Now I will admit that
he can be my match.

734
00:42:04,464 --> 00:42:06,384
Dong Suk.

735
00:42:06,384 --> 00:42:08,964
He's no match for you.

736
00:42:08,964 --> 00:42:11,274
- Don't worry about him.
- No.

737
00:42:11,273 --> 00:42:12,293
If emotions get in the way

738
00:42:12,293 --> 00:42:13,433
I can't win the battle.

739
00:42:13,433 --> 00:42:16,043
I forgot about that for a while.

740
00:42:16,043 --> 00:42:19,203
Now that I admit that he's my match

741
00:42:19,523 --> 00:42:22,613
I'll have to face him properly.

742
00:42:23,523 --> 00:42:27,303
Not with my emotions,
but with my logic.

743
00:42:29,563 --> 00:42:30,863
Hold on.

744
00:42:30,862 --> 00:42:33,372
Sir.

745
00:42:33,372 --> 00:42:35,932
Isn't this a bit too difficult?

746
00:42:35,932 --> 00:42:36,802
What do you think?

747
00:42:36,802 --> 00:42:37,542
In my opinion

748
00:42:37,572 --> 00:42:39,212
conventional market idea
isn't making sense.

749
00:42:39,212 --> 00:42:40,922
It's going to work.

750
00:42:40,922 --> 00:42:43,362
Trust me.

751
00:42:43,362 --> 00:42:45,222
- I understand.
- Let's go.

752
00:42:45,222 --> 00:42:47,482
Hold on.

753
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:49,351
President Cho.

754
00:42:49,352 --> 00:42:50,962
I've seen it once.

755
00:42:50,961 --> 00:42:53,101
Because of the committee
of the creditors

756
00:42:53,101 --> 00:42:55,541
I will finish up and
submit it right away.

757
00:42:55,541 --> 00:42:57,901
Yes, sir.

758
00:43:00,381 --> 00:43:02,401
What is it? Does he want
you to do something for him?

759
00:43:02,401 --> 00:43:06,051
I've been going over his
financial management.

760
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:08,440
It's the least I can do for him.

761
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,250
Let's go.

762
00:43:10,251 --> 00:43:12,251
See you later.

763
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:21,710
There is something I've been
curious about for some time.

764
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:23,620
He must hate my family.

765
00:43:23,619 --> 00:43:27,469
How come he doesn't come
ready to fight like he used to?

766
00:43:27,469 --> 00:43:28,789
To have his revenge

767
00:43:28,789 --> 00:43:31,719
why is he focusing on getting
Hyun Sung Distribution back?

768
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:34,830
It might be because of the compensation
for the people at the market.

769
00:43:34,829 --> 00:43:36,419
He takes Hyun Sung
Distribution back and...

770
00:43:36,419 --> 00:43:39,349
he may try to compensate them.

771
00:43:40,028 --> 00:43:44,428
Partly because he wanted to support the
employees who lost their jobs, right?

772
00:43:44,429 --> 00:43:47,659
Yes, he's most likely to do so.

773
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:53,468
So when he's alone, he's a punk.

774
00:43:53,468 --> 00:43:55,088
When he's with people

775
00:43:55,088 --> 00:43:57,368
he becomes their leader.

776
00:43:57,368 --> 00:43:58,788
His power comes from...

777
00:43:58,787 --> 00:44:01,617
the people who are with him, huh?

778
00:44:01,618 --> 00:44:04,778
Yes, it seems that way to me too.

779
00:44:06,768 --> 00:44:09,828
The way we take away his power is...

780
00:44:09,827 --> 00:44:14,767
we take his people
away one by one, huh?

781
00:44:15,837 --> 00:44:19,097
His people...

782
00:44:19,787 --> 00:44:22,547
That's all. You may leave.

783
00:44:27,897 --> 00:44:30,777
Kim Ji Hyuk's people...

784
00:44:35,496 --> 00:44:38,256
Excuse me.

785
00:44:38,256 --> 00:44:39,746
Mi Ra.

786
00:44:39,746 --> 00:44:41,936
I'm calling to tell you to be careful.

787
00:44:41,936 --> 00:44:46,956
Kang Dong Suk may start to do
something to the people around you.

788
00:44:46,955 --> 00:44:48,125
What do you mean?

789
00:44:48,125 --> 00:44:49,585
<i>He may use the people around you and...</i>

790
00:44:49,585 --> 00:44:51,705
harm you that way.

791
00:44:51,705 --> 00:44:53,565
<i>He might try to make
them betray you or...</i>

792
00:44:53,565 --> 00:44:55,305
Don't worry.

793
00:44:55,304 --> 00:44:57,544
There are no such people around me.

794
00:44:57,544 --> 00:45:00,424
I'm on my way to the committee now.

795
00:45:00,425 --> 00:45:03,585
- Let's talk later.
- Okay.

796
00:45:07,404 --> 00:45:09,224
With this much preparation

797
00:45:09,224 --> 00:45:10,864
it should go smoothly
without a problem, right?

798
00:45:10,864 --> 00:45:13,544
Well, big companies have started to
sell their merchandise to us, and...

799
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:16,574
we prepared the plan as
thoroughly as possible.

800
00:45:16,573 --> 00:45:20,333
I'm not too happy about the
project proposal, but...

801
00:45:20,333 --> 00:45:23,433
it shouldn't be a problem if
there isn't any variable.

802
00:45:23,433 --> 00:45:25,273
If there is a problem

803
00:45:25,273 --> 00:45:27,583
They will switch the legal
administrator or...

804
00:45:27,583 --> 00:45:28,853
sell it to a different company.

805
00:45:28,853 --> 00:45:30,243
The worst scenario would be...

806
00:45:30,242 --> 00:45:33,852
disposing our assets
and then closing down.

807
00:45:33,852 --> 00:45:34,972
If that's the case

808
00:45:34,972 --> 00:45:39,222
what we've been doing
up to now will become all useless.

809
00:45:39,423 --> 00:45:43,693
No, it shouldn't happen that way.

810
00:45:44,982 --> 00:45:47,222
Let's go.

811
00:45:48,042 --> 00:45:50,182
Let's go.

812
00:45:56,291 --> 00:46:01,241
Hello.

813
00:46:02,411 --> 00:46:07,181
It's been very hot lately, hasn't it?

814
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:08,991
Summer is already here, right?

815
00:46:08,990 --> 00:46:11,700
- Hot, isn't it?
- It's cool in here.

816
00:46:12,021 --> 00:46:13,701
Have a seat.

817
00:46:19,331 --> 00:46:21,591
I'm the legal administrator
of Hyun Sung Distribution...

818
00:46:21,590 --> 00:46:24,330
Kim Ji Hyuk.

819
00:46:25,170 --> 00:46:27,010
Representing all the creditors

820
00:46:27,010 --> 00:46:31,040
I'm Cho Young Ho, Director
of Myung Sung Bank.

821
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,450
The rest of us here...

822
00:46:32,449 --> 00:46:34,789
they came representing
the major creditors.

823
00:46:35,289 --> 00:46:38,739
Hello, all.

824
00:46:38,739 --> 00:46:41,299
I'd appreciate your help.

825
00:46:42,869 --> 00:46:45,479
You are...

826
00:46:45,478 --> 00:46:47,388
<i>Admit your fraud charge.</i>

827
00:46:47,389 --> 00:46:49,629
I will let you out on probation.

828
00:46:49,629 --> 00:46:53,509
And they sent you money...

829
00:46:56,258 --> 00:46:58,178
Go tell who sent you here.

830
00:46:58,178 --> 00:47:01,608
I will come after them to finish them.

831
00:47:02,058 --> 00:47:03,718
Hold still.

832
00:47:03,718 --> 00:47:05,288
Even if my body gets all torn apart

833
00:47:05,287 --> 00:47:08,537
I won't let go of my hold.

834
00:47:09,658 --> 00:47:12,348
Why are you here?

835
00:47:12,347 --> 00:47:14,807
You confirmed that Attorney Park
was included on the committee, right?

836
00:47:14,807 --> 00:47:16,417
Yes, I did.

837
00:47:16,417 --> 00:47:19,697
You pinpointed what gets
him all worked up, right?

838
00:47:19,697 --> 00:47:20,647
Yes.

839
00:47:20,647 --> 00:47:22,287
I explained about his personality.

840
00:47:22,287 --> 00:47:24,967
I told him to hold on to his weakness.

841
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:27,227
Good job.

842
00:47:29,216 --> 00:47:33,786
By the way, why is he so obsessed
with the people around him?

843
00:47:33,786 --> 00:47:34,756
If he's nice to them

844
00:47:34,756 --> 00:47:37,146
he's delusional that they
will become his people.

845
00:47:38,366 --> 00:47:41,566
That may be the real delusion.

846
00:47:41,565 --> 00:47:43,635
It's not fair that he's here.

847
00:47:43,636 --> 00:47:47,806
He is here because Kang
Dong Suk paid him.

848
00:47:47,805 --> 00:47:49,575
I can object here, right?

849
00:47:49,576 --> 00:47:51,066
Objection.

850
00:47:51,065 --> 00:47:53,275
Pull him out.

851
00:47:53,276 --> 00:47:56,006
He's been already
approved by the court.

852
00:47:56,005 --> 00:47:57,255
There is no flaw.

853
00:47:57,255 --> 00:48:00,585
What kind of crap is this?

854
00:48:00,584 --> 00:48:02,394
I'm sorry.

855
00:48:02,395 --> 00:48:05,575
He is very quick-tempered,
so we apologize.

856
00:48:05,574 --> 00:48:07,094
It's a small world, huh?

857
00:48:07,095 --> 00:48:09,405
What did you say, you bastard?

858
00:48:09,854 --> 00:48:12,014
Sir, let it go.

859
00:48:12,015 --> 00:48:13,825
If you use your fist here

860
00:48:13,824 --> 00:48:15,944
it will be over for us.

861
00:48:15,944 --> 00:48:17,554
- Please.
- Relax.

862
00:48:17,554 --> 00:48:19,324
Calm down.

863
00:48:19,323 --> 00:48:21,033
We're now ready.

864
00:48:21,034 --> 00:48:22,504
I'm sorry.

865
00:48:22,504 --> 00:48:25,164
Please submit the revival plan first.

866
00:48:25,163 --> 00:48:27,323
- Yes, sir.
- Manager Choi.

867
00:48:31,153 --> 00:48:32,663
As for the repayment of the bonds

868
00:48:32,663 --> 00:48:35,653
what are you planning on doing?

869
00:48:38,313 --> 00:48:40,523
We've started to carry merchandise
from big companies now.

870
00:48:40,522 --> 00:48:43,702
We are seeing the growth in
sales for the last few weeks.

871
00:48:43,703 --> 00:48:45,313
If we have a surplus

872
00:48:45,312 --> 00:48:48,352
we will start repaying our
creditors immediately.

873
00:48:48,353 --> 00:48:50,063
When you have a surplus, immediately?

874
00:48:50,062 --> 00:48:52,472
Then what are you going to do
with paychecks for the employees?

875
00:48:52,472 --> 00:48:53,622
Excuse me.

876
00:48:53,622 --> 00:48:55,012
We were in the middle of
talking about repayment.

877
00:48:55,012 --> 00:48:56,652
Why are you bringing up
paychecks for the employees?

878
00:48:56,651 --> 00:48:59,581
Here the information
on pay cuts is missing.

879
00:48:59,582 --> 00:49:01,692
Same goes for reducing the staff.

880
00:49:01,691 --> 00:49:03,461
Just because you have a surplus

881
00:49:03,462 --> 00:49:05,222
it doesn't mean that you
can afford to repay.

882
00:49:05,221 --> 00:49:07,191
In our position...

883
00:49:07,191 --> 00:49:08,651
No matter how we look at it

884
00:49:08,651 --> 00:49:10,961
Without pay cuts or
a personnel reduction

885
00:49:10,961 --> 00:49:12,281
it's impossible to
stabilize the company.

886
00:49:12,281 --> 00:49:15,311
We will repay even if we
have to make money elsewhere.

887
00:49:15,311 --> 00:49:19,171
Why would you not tap into the area
with the most chance for cost cutting?

888
00:49:19,170 --> 00:49:20,330
Hey, mister.

889
00:49:20,330 --> 00:49:22,870
To be able to make money,
people have to stay on the job.

890
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:24,580
Before machines or systems

891
00:49:24,581 --> 00:49:27,321
how can we make money
if we lose people?

892
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:29,110
Reduction personnel or cost cutting...

893
00:49:29,110 --> 00:49:33,030
It all means getting
rid of people, right?

894
00:49:34,329 --> 00:49:36,459
You don't know much
about business, do you?

895
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:40,620
Are you talking about this when you
haven't learned anything about management?

896
00:49:40,619 --> 00:49:42,749
Hey, you punk.
I'm not educated, okay?

897
00:49:42,749 --> 00:49:45,509
Even if I'm ignorant,
I know how to treat people.

898
00:49:45,509 --> 00:49:47,719
Sir, do you know who he's working for?

899
00:49:47,719 --> 00:49:49,359
To destroy us

900
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:52,149
they made a healthy man
drink rotten milk.

901
00:49:52,149 --> 00:49:54,189
He was paid and sent from Hyun Sung.

902
00:49:54,188 --> 00:49:56,518
He's just like their dog.

903
00:49:56,518 --> 00:49:59,678
Please watch the language.

904
00:49:59,679 --> 00:50:01,689
Without any confirmed proof

905
00:50:01,688 --> 00:50:03,278
I advise you not to talk about it.

906
00:50:03,278 --> 00:50:05,568
We apologize, sir.

907
00:50:05,568 --> 00:50:06,508
Please calm down.

908
00:50:06,508 --> 00:50:08,798
Please move onto the next agenda.
Sorry.

909
00:50:08,798 --> 00:50:12,078
Honestly, what he said wasn't wrong.

910
00:50:12,077 --> 00:50:14,757
Without a reduction of personnel
or a pay cut

911
00:50:14,758 --> 00:50:17,178
it's rare for a company
to become stabilized.

912
00:50:17,178 --> 00:50:20,898
You should come up with the
solution to that agenda.

913
00:50:20,898 --> 00:50:22,318
I already told you.

914
00:50:22,317 --> 00:50:24,177
- It's about...
- Excuse me!

915
00:50:24,177 --> 00:50:26,317
Can we continue after we eat?

916
00:50:26,317 --> 00:50:29,027
Let's eat.

917
00:50:29,027 --> 00:50:31,387
Yes, as you mentioned

918
00:50:31,387 --> 00:50:33,497
he's a moron with no
knowledge in economics.

919
00:50:33,497 --> 00:50:36,087
It's so easy to handle such a person.

920
00:50:36,087 --> 00:50:38,327
Don't worry.

921
00:50:40,486 --> 00:50:42,996
- Hey punk!
- Please.

922
00:50:42,996 --> 00:50:44,806
How much did you get this time, huh?

923
00:50:44,806 --> 00:50:45,376
Sir.

924
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:46,476
When you are a lawyer

925
00:50:46,476 --> 00:50:48,036
how can you like getting
a bribe like that?

926
00:50:48,035 --> 00:50:50,595
What a greedy piece of crap!

927
00:50:50,595 --> 00:50:52,635
- You seriously!
- Sir, please...

928
00:50:52,636 --> 00:50:54,206
- Please calm down.
- Please.

929
00:50:54,205 --> 00:50:57,165
How is it possible to have someone
like him to get on the committee?

930
00:50:57,165 --> 00:50:59,165
This is how things are
in the real world.

931
00:50:59,165 --> 00:51:01,565
Money can get you anywhere.

932
00:51:01,565 --> 00:51:03,345
- Manager Gu.
- You came.

933
00:51:03,344 --> 00:51:05,114
Sir, am I too late?

934
00:51:05,115 --> 00:51:05,785
No, you're not.

935
00:51:05,784 --> 00:51:07,204
What brings you here?

936
00:51:07,205 --> 00:51:08,445
I contacted him.

937
00:51:08,445 --> 00:51:10,705
I asked him to bring the agreement
on the pay cut by the employees.

938
00:51:10,704 --> 00:51:12,274
Pardon?

939
00:51:12,275 --> 00:51:13,315
What else can we do?

940
00:51:13,314 --> 00:51:14,954
We have to fix this first.

941
00:51:14,955 --> 00:51:16,095
I was in a hurry, so...

942
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:17,885
not everybody signed it yet.

943
00:51:17,884 --> 00:51:19,054
But still if it's this
number of people...

944
00:51:19,054 --> 00:51:21,344
Sir!

945
00:51:21,344 --> 00:51:23,604
I won't allow this.

946
00:51:23,604 --> 00:51:25,994
By having my employees
sacrifice themselves

947
00:51:25,994 --> 00:51:27,434
I can't proceed like this.

948
00:51:27,434 --> 00:51:28,724
Sir.

949
00:51:28,724 --> 00:51:32,134
You're like our father to us.

950
00:51:32,133 --> 00:51:33,943
When our family is
just about to go down

951
00:51:33,943 --> 00:51:36,923
we can't just ask our father to
take the full responsibility.

952
00:51:36,923 --> 00:51:38,263
Even if we skip a few meals

953
00:51:38,263 --> 00:51:40,903
we all have to chip in together.

954
00:51:40,902 --> 00:51:44,282
You're the only one we can rely on.

955
00:51:44,283 --> 00:51:45,723
This is not a sacrifice.

956
00:51:45,722 --> 00:51:48,362
We're helping each other as a family.

957
00:51:59,761 --> 00:52:03,041
It looks like the problem
on the pay cut has been resolved.

958
00:52:03,042 --> 00:52:04,412
Next...

959
00:52:04,411 --> 00:52:05,801
in this proposal

960
00:52:05,801 --> 00:52:08,341
there is one thing that
doesn't make sense.

961
00:52:08,341 --> 00:52:10,921
As the major business plan...

962
00:52:10,921 --> 00:52:13,311
introducing a conventional market feel?

963
00:52:13,311 --> 00:52:15,841
Is this child's play or what?

964
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:17,581
By any chance

965
00:52:17,581 --> 00:52:22,011
just because you grew
up in a marketplace

966
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:24,820
did you come up with
this childish plan?

967
00:52:25,790 --> 00:52:27,580
Yes.

968
00:52:27,581 --> 00:52:29,271
That's correct.

969
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:31,850
I grew up in a marketplace.

970
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:35,650
But now there is nothing I can
do about where I grew up.

971
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:37,820
Gentlemen.

972
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:39,820
by any chance

973
00:52:39,819 --> 00:52:42,689
have you ever been to a
conventional market?

974
00:52:42,690 --> 00:52:47,060
Isn't it a place with a
lot of human connection?

975
00:52:47,059 --> 00:52:49,839
Everything is cheap and
full of life there.

976
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:55,039
If we introduce the idea of
a conventional market to our mart

977
00:52:55,039 --> 00:52:57,249
I believe it will be a huge hit.

978
00:52:57,248 --> 00:52:58,098
It's exciting too.

979
00:52:58,099 --> 00:53:00,949
Lady, you choose and
grandma, you choose too.

980
00:53:00,948 --> 00:53:03,458
It's two thousand won for eggs.

981
00:53:03,458 --> 00:53:05,898
Excuse me.

982
00:53:05,898 --> 00:53:09,998
This is not a place to make
a plea with your emotions.

983
00:53:09,998 --> 00:53:12,738
I went a little too far, didn't I?

984
00:53:14,228 --> 00:53:16,338
Well...

985
00:53:16,338 --> 00:53:17,998
it was only the introduction
of my proposal.

986
00:53:17,998 --> 00:53:19,998
The main point is...

987
00:53:19,998 --> 00:53:22,998
About the system of a
conventional market

988
00:53:22,997 --> 00:53:27,317
the part I propose as our
major business plan is...

989
00:53:27,317 --> 00:53:30,207
theses reasons.

990
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:32,367
The foundation of a
market economics is...

991
00:53:32,366 --> 00:53:34,106
the free economic system.

992
00:53:34,107 --> 00:53:35,377
Mi Ra.

993
00:53:35,377 --> 00:53:37,017
In our field of the distribution business

994
00:53:37,016 --> 00:53:39,596
big markets and the
conventional markets are...

995
00:53:39,596 --> 00:53:42,036
two main columns.

996
00:53:42,086 --> 00:53:43,876
Take a look at this here.

997
00:53:43,877 --> 00:53:45,637
As you can see it here

998
00:53:45,636 --> 00:53:47,306
The system of a conventional market

999
00:53:47,306 --> 00:53:51,956
is the first step to resolve
the issues of a big market.

1000
00:53:51,956 --> 00:53:54,516
Compared to big markets,
conventional markets...

1001
00:53:54,515 --> 00:53:57,195
they don't need big
facilities or investment.

1002
00:53:57,195 --> 00:53:59,805
The investment costs are
relatively low, and...

1003
00:53:59,805 --> 00:54:02,095
hold on, please.

1004
00:54:02,095 --> 00:54:03,785
They can have many variety of stores.

1005
00:54:03,786 --> 00:54:07,216
They can hold many merchants
in one area and...

1006
00:54:07,215 --> 00:54:09,325
The price competition
is already set up.

1007
00:54:09,345 --> 00:54:11,565
The merchandise is set accordingly.

1008
00:54:11,565 --> 00:54:16,135
They target the consumers with
middle income as the main consumers.

1009
00:54:16,134 --> 00:54:18,134
They directly deal with the suppliers.

1010
00:54:18,134 --> 00:54:20,634
They save the extra
cost in transportation.

1011
00:54:20,634 --> 00:54:23,154
All these made me think
of this conventional

1012
00:54:23,164 --> 00:54:25,704
market as our major
business plan.

1013
00:54:25,704 --> 00:54:27,514
If we work with these areas

1014
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:31,664
unlike the way how other marts are run

1015
00:54:31,664 --> 00:54:35,614
I'm certain we can raise our sales.

1016
00:54:38,403 --> 00:54:40,443
It sounds doable.

1017
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:43,003
It's a good plan.

1018
00:54:51,373 --> 00:54:56,323
How did you hear that he was
some sort of moron, huh?

1019
00:54:56,323 --> 00:54:58,183
What's the point of me objecting?

1020
00:54:58,182 --> 00:55:00,592
while all the other four
directors were agreeing.

1021
00:55:00,592 --> 00:55:02,032
Sir, was that really you?

1022
00:55:02,032 --> 00:55:02,932
Was that really you?

1023
00:55:02,932 --> 00:55:04,172
I thought it was somebody else.

1024
00:55:04,172 --> 00:55:06,482
I will go to pray in the
mornings from now on.

1025
00:55:06,482 --> 00:55:08,252
I witnessed a miracle today.

1026
00:55:08,252 --> 00:55:10,092
What really happened?

1027
00:55:10,092 --> 00:55:11,982
- Wait...
- What's wrong?

1028
00:55:12,001 --> 00:55:13,541
- I have to focus now.
- Yes?

1029
00:55:13,541 --> 00:55:16,971
It feels like there is an
earthquake in my head now.

1030
00:55:17,592 --> 00:55:18,862
Your brain is asleep now.

1031
00:55:18,862 --> 00:55:20,652
It wasn't used for a while.

1032
00:55:20,651 --> 00:55:22,991
Hold my head.

1033
00:55:22,991 --> 00:55:25,001
Let's go for some cold beer.

1034
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:29,620
Did you see everybody's face?

1035
00:55:30,191 --> 00:55:32,031
Mother!

1036
00:55:32,030 --> 00:55:33,770
- Come here to have some.
- Please join us.

1037
00:55:33,770 --> 00:55:36,080
It's okay. I'm still open.

1038
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:39,960
- Mother, come here to sit.
- What are you doing?

1039
00:55:40,430 --> 00:55:42,700
- What is it?
- Mother.

1040
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:45,310
Do you know what today is?

1041
00:55:45,310 --> 00:55:49,130
I used my head for the
first time in my life...

1042
00:55:49,130 --> 00:55:52,460
I made something big happen.

1043
00:55:52,459 --> 00:55:55,939
Did you head-but someone again?

1044
00:55:55,989 --> 00:55:57,629
Mother, seriously...

1045
00:55:57,628 --> 00:56:00,568
Manager Gu, tell her.

1046
00:56:00,569 --> 00:56:05,109
Tell her what I said
today to shock people.

1047
00:56:05,108 --> 00:56:06,278
She might not believe me.

1048
00:56:06,278 --> 00:56:08,368
It's just that he did...

1049
00:56:08,368 --> 00:56:11,678
Mother, do you know the
foundation of market economics?

1050
00:56:11,678 --> 00:56:14,428
- Wow.
- There you go again.

1051
00:56:14,428 --> 00:56:16,618
What nonsense is that?

1052
00:56:16,618 --> 00:56:17,908
- Manager Choi.
- Yes?

1053
00:56:17,908 --> 00:56:18,958
Only this much.

1054
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:19,848
- Manager Choi.
- Yes?

1055
00:56:19,848 --> 00:56:24,668
Tell her how fabulous I was today...
only that much.

1056
00:56:24,667 --> 00:56:26,337
If I have to tell you only that much

1057
00:56:26,337 --> 00:56:28,867
what a great job he did today...

1058
00:56:28,867 --> 00:56:29,597
Mother.

1059
00:56:29,597 --> 00:56:32,227
The effect on differentiated products

1060
00:56:32,227 --> 00:56:35,827
do you know what the merit
of one-stop shopping is?

1061
00:56:36,647 --> 00:56:39,057
Did he eat something bad today?

1062
00:56:40,727 --> 00:56:42,667
Mother.

1063
00:56:42,666 --> 00:56:44,826
I've been joking.

1064
00:56:44,826 --> 00:56:49,276
I realized something
after I did some studying.

1065
00:56:49,276 --> 00:56:52,586
Even if you use difficult words
and are proud of yourself

1066
00:56:52,586 --> 00:56:55,216
your fundamentals don't change.

1067
00:56:57,006 --> 00:57:00,166
I proudly grew up in a market.

1068
00:57:00,165 --> 00:57:02,965
The market raised me.

1069
00:57:03,415 --> 00:57:05,955
I'm a kid who grew up in a market.

1070
00:57:17,065 --> 00:57:18,725
I'm sorry.

1071
00:57:18,724 --> 00:57:21,704
Since I admitted that he was my match

1072
00:57:21,705 --> 00:57:24,795
I expected this much.

1073
00:57:26,004 --> 00:57:29,384
I let him fatten up himself.

1074
00:57:29,384 --> 00:57:32,474
It's time to hunt.

1075
00:57:33,584 --> 00:57:37,214
<i>After we find out his vulnerable spot</i>

1076
00:57:37,884 --> 00:57:40,994
<i>we attack the areas around it.</i>

1077
00:57:42,513 --> 00:57:46,093
<i>We don't ever send him
away with one blow.</i>

1078
00:57:46,093 --> 00:57:49,813
<i>We make sure he suffers
slowly until he dies.</i>

1079
00:57:56,192 --> 00:58:04,192

1080
00:58:16,581 --> 00:58:20,041
Why does he have my secret book?

1081
00:58:20,041 --> 00:58:21,881
Please forgive me once.

1082
00:58:21,881 --> 00:58:24,391
We will work under you like a dog.

1083
00:58:24,391 --> 00:58:25,781
They found out we took it.

1084
00:58:25,781 --> 00:58:27,781
So they took it back.

1085
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:30,480
There is a big possibility that
So Mi Ra was in on it too.

1086
00:58:30,481 --> 00:58:33,431
We will go back to the
time when we were in love.

1087
00:58:33,431 --> 00:58:34,901
Don't go.

1088
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:35,840
It's okay that you want
us to stay as friends.

1089
00:58:35,841 --> 00:58:37,981
Just let me stay near you.
I'm asking you.

1090
00:58:37,981 --> 00:58:39,501
You've been enough help.

1091
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:41,500
Walk away now.

1092
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:43,520
He took away all that was mine.

1093
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,480
How can I possibly forgive him?
