1
00:01:22,323 --> 00:01:23,992
Thorny.

2
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:34,502
You call this a report card?

3
00:01:34,544 --> 00:01:37,297
What kind of marks is these?

4
00:01:37,338 --> 00:01:40,300
How you gonna go to college
with marks like these?

5
00:01:40,341 --> 00:01:41,593
I don't want to go to college.

6
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:43,344
I want to work
in the shop with you.

7
00:01:43,386 --> 00:01:45,138
You want to work
in the shop with me, huh?

8
00:01:45,179 --> 00:01:47,015
Listen to me.

9
00:01:47,056 --> 00:01:49,767
I said it once,
and I'll say it again...

10
00:01:49,851 --> 00:01:52,645
I don't care how rich
or successful a man is...

11
00:01:52,687 --> 00:01:55,565
if he don't got an education,
he's got nothing.

12
00:01:55,607 --> 00:01:58,610
- I tried, Pop. I can't do it.
- Then try harder!

13
00:02:03,865 --> 00:02:07,368
You can do anything in life
you want to do.

14
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:11,623
Remember... you're a Meloni.

15
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:23,963
Hi there.
Are you a large person?

16
00:04:24,005 --> 00:04:26,591
Pleasantly plump? A little
on the hefty side, perhaps?

17
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:28,968
Well, let's face it.
Are you fat?

18
00:04:29,052 --> 00:04:30,970
When you go jogging,
do you leave potholes?

19
00:04:31,012 --> 00:04:33,264
When you make love,
do you have to give directions?

20
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:35,516
At the zoo, do elephants
throw you peanuts?

21
00:04:35,558 --> 00:04:37,560
Do you look at a menu
and say, "OK"?

22
00:04:37,602 --> 00:04:39,437
Well, now you can
eat all you want...

23
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,439
because at Thornton Melon's
Tall and Fat stores...

24
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:42,690
we've got you covered.

25
00:04:42,732 --> 00:04:45,193
That's right... fine woolen
and woolen blend suits...

26
00:04:45,235 --> 00:04:47,403
and sport coats
in all the larger sizes...

27
00:04:47,445 --> 00:04:51,115
husky, stout, extra-stout
and the new Hindenburg line.

28
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:53,743
And for you ladies,
we have caftans, muumuus...

29
00:04:53,785 --> 00:04:56,788
and our own exclusive A-frame
in all colors and patterns.

30
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:59,374
Yes, we have
miles and miles of fabric.

31
00:04:59,415 --> 00:05:01,417
So take it from me,
Thornton Melon...

32
00:05:01,459 --> 00:05:04,921
if you want to look thin,
you hang out with fat people.

33
00:05:04,963 --> 00:05:08,758
Thornton Melon's Tall and Fat...
150 locations across America.

34
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,261
Lou, did you see the new spot?

35
00:05:11,302 --> 00:05:12,428
Yeah, I seen it.

36
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:13,763
Do I look fat in it?

37
00:05:13,805 --> 00:05:15,473
You could lose
a couple of pounds.

38
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:18,810
I gotta get bigger actors.

39
00:05:21,396 --> 00:05:24,732
Pocahontas, how are you?
Ophelia, hold some of my calls.

40
00:05:24,774 --> 00:05:27,151
Yes, sir, Mr. Melon.

41
00:05:30,154 --> 00:05:31,114
Good morning, everyone.

42
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:33,283
Morning.

43
00:05:33,324 --> 00:05:34,951
Take it easy, will ya?

44
00:05:34,993 --> 00:05:38,538
And don't get any on the walls.

45
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,748
OK, folks. What's up?

46
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,834
Mr. Melon,
we have a serious offer...

47
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:45,837
on your commercial property
in south Florida...

48
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,881
and we feel you should sell.

49
00:05:47,922 --> 00:05:50,675
No. Hold it for one more year,
take the depreciation...

50
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:53,303
then transfer title
to the California Corporation.

51
00:05:53,344 --> 00:05:55,513
Show it as a capital gain.
We should do great.

52
00:05:58,349 --> 00:05:59,559
What else?

53
00:05:59,601 --> 00:06:01,895
The toy division has come up
with a new doll idea...

54
00:06:01,936 --> 00:06:04,522
to go along with our
children's clothing line.

55
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:07,358
We call them Melon Patch Kids.

56
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,694
Now, the competition
exploits the notion...

57
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:12,447
that their dolls are orphans.

58
00:06:12,488 --> 00:06:15,700
The Melon Patch Kids
are not orphans.

59
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:17,911
They're abandoned.

60
00:06:17,994 --> 00:06:19,454
We think it's a winner.

61
00:06:19,495 --> 00:06:20,747
OK, go with it.

62
00:06:20,788 --> 00:06:23,166
But keep the unit cost
under five bucks.

63
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:26,377
Last year, we took a bath
on those Chubby Tubby Tub toys.

64
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:28,838
- Jason's on the phone.
- Jason.

65
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,424
OK, everybody, take a break.

66
00:06:31,466 --> 00:06:35,595
Excuse me, Mr. Melon,
but we have a very long agenda.

67
00:06:35,637 --> 00:06:38,765
- Later. My son's on the phone.
- But, Mr. Melon!

68
00:06:38,806 --> 00:06:40,808
Beat it, punk.

69
00:06:43,686 --> 00:06:44,812
Jason, how are you?

70
00:06:44,854 --> 00:06:46,814
How you doin'?
How's the diving going?

71
00:06:46,856 --> 00:06:49,609
Oh, it's great.
We just finished up practice.

72
00:06:49,651 --> 00:06:51,861
Oh, keep it up, keep it up!
And the fraternity...

73
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,863
I'll bet you're having fun
in the fraternity, huh?

74
00:06:53,905 --> 00:06:56,908
What do you think?
Yeah, it's great.

75
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,493
Oh, that's great.

76
00:06:58,535 --> 00:07:01,162
You're not doing too much,
are you? You studying?

77
00:07:01,204 --> 00:07:03,456
Well, right now,
we're between semesters...

78
00:07:03,498 --> 00:07:05,458
so classes don't start up
again for another week.

79
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,710
No classes? Then come home.

80
00:07:07,752 --> 00:07:09,546
Tonight, your mother and I
are having a big party.

81
00:07:09,587 --> 00:07:10,964
It's our fifth anniversary.

82
00:07:11,005 --> 00:07:15,260
Whoa, Dad. She's not my mother,
she's your wife...

83
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:17,470
and I don't get the feeling
she wants me around.

84
00:07:17,512 --> 00:07:20,014
OK, let's not start that again.

85
00:07:20,056 --> 00:07:22,350
I'll tell you what.
I'll come up there to see you.

86
00:07:22,392 --> 00:07:24,359
No. Bad. Bad idea.

87
00:07:24,394 --> 00:07:26,396
I got this big dive meet
coming up.

88
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,731
I gotta practice. I wouldn't
have any time to see you.

89
00:07:28,773 --> 00:07:31,818
- It's a rotten time.
- OK. I understand.

90
00:07:31,859 --> 00:07:33,027
Look, Dad, I promise...

91
00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:35,321
I'll come down for a visit
next break I get, OK?

92
00:07:35,405 --> 00:07:38,199
All right?
Look, I gotta go, OK?

93
00:07:38,241 --> 00:07:39,367
OK, Jason.

94
00:07:39,409 --> 00:07:41,494
Take care of yourself.
I love you.

95
00:07:41,536 --> 00:07:44,497
Yeah, I love you, too.
All right. Bye-bye.

96
00:07:44,622 --> 00:07:46,583
Melon, I told you
to clean my locker.

97
00:07:46,624 --> 00:07:48,209
If it's too much for you...

98
00:07:48,251 --> 00:07:50,086
we'll get ourselves
a new towel boy.

99
00:07:50,128 --> 00:07:54,173
Right. Look, I'm sorry, Chas.
I'll get on it as soon as I can.

100
00:08:11,149 --> 00:08:12,323
Home sweet home.

101
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:15,194
- I liked the old house better.
- So did I.

102
00:08:15,236 --> 00:08:16,821
I liked the old wife
better, too.

103
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:19,782
Lay off Vanessa.
She gives great headache.

104
00:08:19,824 --> 00:08:21,910
Lou, I can't believe it.
Married five years.

105
00:08:21,951 --> 00:08:23,870
Seems like yesterday.

106
00:08:23,912 --> 00:08:26,456
And you know what a lousy day
yesterday was.

107
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:34,088
Please don't throw your clothes
on the Breuer chair.

108
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:37,050
How come all our furniture
has names?

109
00:08:37,091 --> 00:08:39,552
I have absolutely
nothing to wear.

110
00:08:39,594 --> 00:08:41,763
You got six closets
full of nothing to wear.

111
00:08:41,804 --> 00:08:44,682
Are you saying
I spend too much money?

112
00:08:44,717 --> 00:08:46,559
You, spend too much money? No.

113
00:08:46,601 --> 00:08:50,313
Lots of people go to Switzerland
to get their watch fixed.

114
00:08:50,355 --> 00:08:53,107
You have no taste, Thornton.

115
00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:55,193
You're right.
I married you, didn't I?

116
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:56,527
I don't have time to argue.

117
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:58,071
Our friends will be here
any minute.

118
00:08:58,112 --> 00:08:59,405
You mean your friends.

119
00:08:59,447 --> 00:09:02,367
They are my friends,
and I'd like to keep them.

120
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:04,285
So please,
just behave yourself tonight.

121
00:09:04,327 --> 00:09:07,163
Don't worry. If the roast beef
is right, they'll be back.

122
00:09:12,544 --> 00:09:14,837
Jennifer, you look divine.

123
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:17,674
And, Peter, I thought
you were still in Portofino.

124
00:09:17,715 --> 00:09:20,593
Why haven't you called?

125
00:09:20,635 --> 00:09:23,221
- She's a lovely gal.
- Oh, yes, she is.

126
00:09:23,256 --> 00:09:25,890
Oh, Ramon,
you look fantastic.

127
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:28,226
I thought you were still
in Tijuana.

128
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:31,312
- Excuse me, señor?
- Nothing. It's all right.

129
00:09:31,396 --> 00:09:33,898
- Gimme a beer.
- I'm sorry, señor.

130
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,818
All we have is martinis
and champagne.

131
00:09:36,853 --> 00:09:39,028
My own house,
I can't get a beer.

132
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:42,574
Mrs. Melon gave us
strict orders... no cerveza.

133
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:45,034
It's all right.
I'll get it myself.

134
00:10:01,843 --> 00:10:03,344
Hey! Adam and evil.

135
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:07,849
Mr. Melon.

136
00:10:07,891 --> 00:10:09,767
We was just...

137
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:12,812
looking for some
cocktail napkins.

138
00:10:12,854 --> 00:10:14,647
Where? Under her dress?

139
00:10:14,689 --> 00:10:16,482
You're impossible.

140
00:10:16,524 --> 00:10:17,859
And you're easy.

141
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:24,449
I love Klimt, don't you?

142
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:27,619
Mr. Melon, your wife
was just showing us her Klimt.

143
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,580
You too, huh? She's showin' it
to everybody.

144
00:10:30,622 --> 00:10:32,790
- She's very proud of it.
- I'm proud of mine, too.

145
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:34,918
I don't wave it around
at parties.

146
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,420
- It's an exceptional painting.
- Oh, the painting.

147
00:10:37,462 --> 00:10:40,173
Yeah. Drink up,
enjoy yourself, huh?

148
00:10:45,595 --> 00:10:47,889
I hate small food, you know?

149
00:11:12,163 --> 00:11:14,123
Hey, buddy,
come here, will you?

150
00:11:14,165 --> 00:11:16,042
Put your hand
right over there, will you?

151
00:11:16,084 --> 00:11:18,044
I learned this in Europe.

152
00:11:24,425 --> 00:11:27,053
Look out, coming through.
Hot stuff. Look out.

153
00:11:29,681 --> 00:11:31,641
I'd like you to meet
Mr. And Mrs. Stuyvesant.

154
00:11:31,683 --> 00:11:32,767
Right, right.

155
00:11:32,809 --> 00:11:34,310
- How do you do?
- Thornton!

156
00:11:37,146 --> 00:11:39,440
How you doin'?

157
00:11:41,818 --> 00:11:43,778
Hi there, sir. How are you?

158
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:48,783
Never mind. I got my own here.
It's all right.

159
00:11:51,327 --> 00:11:54,330
Millicent, you look charming.
I love your dress.

160
00:11:54,372 --> 00:11:56,207
Don't you, Thornton?

161
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:58,209
It's such a lovely shade
of green.

162
00:11:58,251 --> 00:12:01,588
Yeah. If that dress had pockets,
you'd look like a pool table.

163
00:12:01,629 --> 00:12:03,631
You should try
my Tall and Fat stores.

164
00:12:03,673 --> 00:12:04,841
No offense.

165
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:10,930
May I speak to you
privately, please?

166
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:17,270
Watch my sandwich, will you?

167
00:12:18,813 --> 00:12:20,940
I can't take any more of this!

168
00:12:20,982 --> 00:12:23,776
You've insulted our friends,
you've insulted me...

169
00:12:23,818 --> 00:12:26,029
and you've gone out of your way
to ruin this party.

170
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:28,406
Party? Are you kiddin'?
It's a dog show out there.

171
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:31,034
Your friends, they come here
for free food, free booze...

172
00:12:31,075 --> 00:12:33,161
and to suck up to you
for donations.

173
00:12:33,244 --> 00:12:36,206
You have no class, Thornton,
and I am tired of it.

174
00:12:36,247 --> 00:12:37,707
I want a divorce.

175
00:12:37,749 --> 00:12:40,335
Divorce. I knew
we had something in common.

176
00:12:40,376 --> 00:12:41,878
Here, sign these.

177
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:47,467
I'm afraid it's not gonna be
that easy, honey.

178
00:12:47,508 --> 00:12:50,178
This is gonna cost you...
plenty!

179
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,388
Oh, yeah?

180
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:54,933
Let's talk about class
a minute, all right?

181
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:56,976
Here's you and Giorgio
in the guest room.

182
00:12:57,011 --> 00:12:58,686
Classy, isn't it?

183
00:12:58,728 --> 00:13:00,563
Here's you and Giorgio
in the rumpus room.

184
00:13:00,605 --> 00:13:02,315
Another classy one, huh?

185
00:13:02,357 --> 00:13:05,235
This one I can't figure out.
There's you, there's Giorgio...

186
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:07,403
what's with the midget
over here?

187
00:13:07,445 --> 00:13:09,781
Hey, wait! I got more!

188
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:23,336
What happened in there?

189
00:13:23,378 --> 00:13:25,088
What happened?

190
00:13:25,129 --> 00:13:28,758
I got rid of Vanessa.
I feel like I just got paroled.

191
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,010
I'll tell you what bothers me...

192
00:13:31,052 --> 00:13:33,388
I let her come
between me and Jason.

193
00:13:33,429 --> 00:13:36,516
Lou, pack our bags.

194
00:13:41,813 --> 00:13:44,232
We're going up to that college
to see my son!

195
00:14:21,352 --> 00:14:23,980
Boy, will Jason be surprised.

196
00:14:24,022 --> 00:14:26,983
Look, there's Greek letters.
That must be the house.

197
00:14:46,836 --> 00:14:48,755
Is that an "amigo"
or a unicorn?

198
00:14:48,796 --> 00:14:50,882
Beats me.
Don't you know any Greek?

199
00:14:50,924 --> 00:14:52,967
The only Greek I know owns
a coffee shop on State Street.

200
00:14:53,051 --> 00:14:55,595
Jimmy Pitsos, remember him?
He had an ugly wife...

201
00:14:55,637 --> 00:14:58,473
four ugly kids,
and good coffee.

202
00:14:58,514 --> 00:15:00,934
Wait here, I'll try this one.

203
00:15:13,238 --> 00:15:15,323
Hello, hello!

204
00:15:18,409 --> 00:15:20,912
Anybody here?

205
00:15:20,954 --> 00:15:23,831
Jason, where are you?

206
00:15:23,873 --> 00:15:26,543
Hey, I need some help here!

207
00:15:26,584 --> 00:15:29,837
Buddy, I'm talking to you.
I need some help here!

208
00:15:29,921 --> 00:15:32,882
Take it easy, honey!
I didn't see a thing.

209
00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:34,634
You're perfect.

210
00:15:34,676 --> 00:15:36,809
You jerk!

211
00:15:36,844 --> 00:15:38,972
Perfectly understandable,
Mr. Melon.

212
00:15:39,097 --> 00:15:41,683
It was an honest mistake.
Let's just call it a bad day.

213
00:15:41,724 --> 00:15:44,477
Yeah, but a great view.
You're all right, officer.

214
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:45,979
Here, a little something
for the kids.

215
00:15:46,062 --> 00:15:48,314
- Take that, it's OK.
- I don't have any kids.

216
00:15:48,356 --> 00:15:50,316
No kids? Well, here,
get yourself some kids.

217
00:15:50,358 --> 00:15:52,569
Take it all, all right?
And just remember...

218
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:55,154
the best thing about kids
is making 'em.

219
00:15:56,948 --> 00:15:59,158
Even if I do manage
to graduate... ha ha...

220
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,578
what do I do then?
There's the private sector...

221
00:16:01,619 --> 00:16:03,705
but look how bad
the job market is.

222
00:16:03,746 --> 00:16:05,164
There's Valerie Desmond.

223
00:16:05,206 --> 00:16:06,958
See you guys.

224
00:16:10,086 --> 00:16:12,797
Look how tight
her ass is today.

225
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:15,508
Oh, man. You think
there's any way...

226
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:18,678
she would ever go out with me?

227
00:16:18,761 --> 00:16:21,014
- No.
- Oh, thanks.

228
00:16:21,055 --> 00:16:23,224
It's this whole stupid
capitalist system, you know?

229
00:16:23,266 --> 00:16:25,018
It's set up to heap rewards...

230
00:16:25,059 --> 00:16:26,603
on the advantaged
and the aggressive...

231
00:16:26,644 --> 00:16:28,688
and to make sure
that two regular schmoes...

232
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:32,609
like you and me never get a date
with girls like Valerie Desmond.

233
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:35,612
I hate the whole bourgeois
mentality of this school.

234
00:16:35,653 --> 00:16:37,572
Let me ask you
something else, man.

235
00:16:37,614 --> 00:16:39,866
Do you make this bullshit up
as you go along...

236
00:16:39,908 --> 00:16:42,410
- or do you actually read this?
- I read this. It's Karl Marx.

237
00:16:42,452 --> 00:16:44,787
Famous book.
"Proletarian Chicks in Bondage. "

238
00:16:44,829 --> 00:16:47,332
It's a Condom House book.
Comes with a leather hood.

239
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:49,000
Is that the one
with the pictures?

240
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:50,376
- Can I borrow that?
- Let's move on.

241
00:16:50,418 --> 00:16:53,129
Well, no, it's, you know...

242
00:16:53,171 --> 00:16:55,381
Oh, yeah. Well, you know.

243
00:16:57,508 --> 00:17:00,720
Dad, what are you doin' here?

244
00:17:00,762 --> 00:17:03,139
I'm robbin' your room,
that's what I'm doin' here.

245
00:17:03,181 --> 00:17:04,933
We drive 300 miles
to see the kid...

246
00:17:04,974 --> 00:17:08,019
that's the greeting we get.
Come here, will ya?

247
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:11,314
How ya doin' there?

248
00:17:11,356 --> 00:17:13,608
I'm sorry.
I'm really glad to see you...

249
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:15,443
but I wish
I knew you were coming.

250
00:17:15,485 --> 00:17:16,736
I'll bet you did, huh?

251
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:18,488
I looked for you
at that fraternity house.

252
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:20,823
- They said you weren't a member.
- I can explain that.

253
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:22,242
They also told me
you're not on the diving team.

254
00:17:22,283 --> 00:17:24,327
They said you were
the towel boy.

255
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:26,704
- I can explain that, too.
- OK, explain it.

256
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:29,582
- I lied.
- Great. That explains it, huh?

257
00:17:29,624 --> 00:17:32,752
Jason, you don't lie to me.
You lie to girls.

258
00:17:34,212 --> 00:17:35,338
Who's this?

259
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,507
Oh, I'm sorry.
This is my roommate.

260
00:17:37,542 --> 00:17:38,508
That's Derek Lutz.

261
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:41,261
This is the dad,
and that's Lou.

262
00:17:41,302 --> 00:17:43,763
- Is that your real hair?
- What do you think?

263
00:17:43,805 --> 00:17:46,933
I think you're trying
to get back at your parents.

264
00:17:46,968 --> 00:17:49,060
Show me the campus.
I want to talk to you.

265
00:17:49,102 --> 00:17:50,270
Oh, good.

266
00:17:58,027 --> 00:18:00,071
Boy, what a great-lookin' place.

267
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:01,865
When I used to dream
about going to college...

268
00:18:01,906 --> 00:18:03,498
this is the way
I always pictured it.

269
00:18:03,533 --> 00:18:05,618
Wait a minute. When did you
dream about going to college?

270
00:18:05,702 --> 00:18:08,997
When I used to fall asleep
in high school.

271
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:10,957
Dad, I know how much
all this means to you...

272
00:18:10,999 --> 00:18:14,377
- and I'm sorry I lied to you.
- You don't have to lie to me.

273
00:18:14,419 --> 00:18:16,921
No matter what you do,
I'll love you just the same.

274
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:18,339
Will you love me
no matter what?

275
00:18:18,381 --> 00:18:19,549
No matter what.

276
00:18:19,591 --> 00:18:22,343
- I'm droppin' out.
- You're droppin' out?

277
00:18:22,378 --> 00:18:24,929
You just got here.
You just started.

278
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:26,931
I know,
but I'm not making it here.

279
00:18:26,973 --> 00:18:29,225
I don't fit in, you know?
I got one friend... Derek.

280
00:18:29,267 --> 00:18:31,227
He's got no friends.

281
00:18:31,269 --> 00:18:33,771
The girls don't like me,
the fraternities don't want me.

282
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:35,398
The diving coach
won't even talk to me.

283
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,483
Look at it this way...

284
00:18:37,525 --> 00:18:39,485
at least you're getting
an education.

285
00:18:39,527 --> 00:18:42,071
Dad, last semester
I got nothing but "Cs. "

286
00:18:42,113 --> 00:18:43,907
A, B, C...
you're in the top three.

287
00:18:43,948 --> 00:18:45,533
What are you worrying about?

288
00:18:45,617 --> 00:18:47,368
I just think I'd be
a lot better off...

289
00:18:47,452 --> 00:18:49,037
gettin' a job or something.

290
00:18:49,078 --> 00:18:51,414
You never went to college.
Look how great you're doin'.

291
00:18:51,456 --> 00:18:54,042
Jason, I said it before
and I'll say it again.

292
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:56,294
I don't care how rich
and successful a man is.

293
00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:57,921
Without an education,
he's nothing.

294
00:18:57,962 --> 00:19:00,298
I mean, stay in school.
Study harder.

295
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,217
You can be whatever
you want to be.

296
00:19:02,258 --> 00:19:03,760
You want to be a loser,
be a loser.

297
00:19:03,801 --> 00:19:04,886
You want to be a winner,
be a winner.

298
00:19:04,928 --> 00:19:07,138
Jason, it's up to you.
You can do it.

299
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:10,099
Remember, you're a Melon!

300
00:19:10,141 --> 00:19:14,270
Dad, that's easy for you to say.
You don't have to do any of it.

301
00:19:16,606 --> 00:19:18,900
OK, then.
I'll do it with you.

302
00:19:20,276 --> 00:19:21,736
What do you mean,
you'll do it with me?

303
00:19:21,778 --> 00:19:24,197
I mean just what I said.

304
00:19:24,239 --> 00:19:26,199
I'm going to college.
What do you think?

305
00:19:26,241 --> 00:19:28,701
What do I think?
I think you're nuts.

306
00:19:28,743 --> 00:19:32,539
Nuts, huh? Who made the rules?
Come here. I'm going to college!

307
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,082
I'm going to college!

308
00:19:37,001 --> 00:19:39,587
Let me get this straight,
Mr. Melon.

309
00:19:39,671 --> 00:19:43,174
You wish to enter
this widely esteemed...

310
00:19:43,216 --> 00:19:45,677
Grand Lakes University of ours
as a freshman?

311
00:19:45,718 --> 00:19:47,512
That's right, Dean Martin.

312
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:52,141
- Are you comfortable?
- I'm fine, yeah.

313
00:19:52,183 --> 00:19:54,269
Oh, the chair. I'm sorry.

314
00:19:57,313 --> 00:20:00,149
This is an awkward moment
for me, Mr. Melon...

315
00:20:00,191 --> 00:20:02,527
since I realize you're
a highly respected member...

316
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:04,112
of our business community.

317
00:20:04,153 --> 00:20:06,948
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

318
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:10,577
Our student body here
is handpicked by me...

319
00:20:10,618 --> 00:20:12,078
from the crème de la crème...

320
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,248
of students all across
this great land of ours.

321
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:17,292
That's one of the things
I like about this place.

322
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:19,377
Yes. The point is, though...

323
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:21,379
since you have
no high school diploma...

324
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:24,841
and no transcripts of any kind,
no S.A.T. Scores...

325
00:20:24,883 --> 00:20:28,595
and you're 30 to 40 years older
than our average freshman...

326
00:20:28,636 --> 00:20:31,389
how can this university
ever see its way clear...

327
00:20:31,431 --> 00:20:33,808
to accept you as a student?

328
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:36,436
As Calvin Coolidge once said...

329
00:20:36,477 --> 00:20:39,522
"The business of America
is business"...

330
00:20:39,564 --> 00:20:42,025
and the business of
an educational institution...

331
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:44,694
such as ours
is to create young minds...

332
00:20:44,736 --> 00:20:46,654
that understand that
the business of America...

333
00:20:46,696 --> 00:20:50,331
is the kind of business
that it actually is.

334
00:20:50,366 --> 00:20:54,412
So, whatever it is that
I have said here today...

335
00:20:54,454 --> 00:20:59,083
the point is
that we are here to honor...

336
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:02,212
our most generous benefactor...

337
00:21:02,253 --> 00:21:05,006
and newest freshman...

338
00:21:05,048 --> 00:21:06,799
the man who's
made it possible...

339
00:21:06,841 --> 00:21:09,719
for us to break ground
here today...

340
00:21:09,761 --> 00:21:12,096
Mr. Thornton Melon.

341
00:21:15,266 --> 00:21:17,560
Dean Martin, great speech.

342
00:21:17,602 --> 00:21:19,979
There's nothing like good,
clean business, huh?

343
00:21:20,021 --> 00:21:23,066
And a little monkey business.

344
00:21:23,107 --> 00:21:26,361
Oh, Philip. I'm so glad
you could make it.

345
00:21:26,402 --> 00:21:28,780
Mr. Melon, I'd like for you
to meet Dr. Philip Barbay...

346
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:32,867
who's the dean
of our school of business.

347
00:21:32,909 --> 00:21:34,702
David, I just want
to get it on record...

348
00:21:34,744 --> 00:21:36,287
that I am totally against this.

349
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:38,498
I don't think
that selling admission...

350
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,583
to an obviously
unqualified student...

351
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:43,127
is very ethical or honorable.

352
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:46,714
Right, Phil,
but I'd just like to say...

353
00:21:46,756 --> 00:21:49,050
in all fairness
to Mr. Melon here...

354
00:21:49,092 --> 00:21:52,053
it was a really big check.

355
00:21:52,095 --> 00:21:54,180
It's a simple matter
of this man's presence...

356
00:21:54,222 --> 00:21:57,183
undermining the efforts
of our legitimate students...

357
00:21:57,225 --> 00:21:59,227
who are here as a result
of hard work.

358
00:21:59,262 --> 00:22:00,520
Hard work?

359
00:22:00,562 --> 00:22:03,314
Listen, Sherlock, while you were
tucked away up here...

360
00:22:03,356 --> 00:22:05,316
working on your ethics,
I was out there...

361
00:22:05,358 --> 00:22:07,360
busting my hump
in the real world.

362
00:22:07,402 --> 00:22:09,571
And the reason guys like you
got a place to teach...

363
00:22:09,612 --> 00:22:12,260
is 'cause guys like me
donate buildings.

364
00:22:12,295 --> 00:22:14,909
I wasn't speaking to you,
Mr. Melon.

365
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:24,523
I don't think
Dr. Barbay understands...

366
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:27,088
the actual amounts
that are involved here.

367
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:31,342
Mr. Melon, will you take
the ceremonial shovel?

368
00:22:31,384 --> 00:22:32,343
Thank you.

369
00:22:32,385 --> 00:22:35,263
And dig into the symbolic dirt.

370
00:22:37,891 --> 00:22:42,896
I hereby dedicate
this building to... myself.

371
00:22:55,074 --> 00:22:57,076
Now, Dad, it's just like
we talked about.

372
00:22:57,118 --> 00:22:59,078
You sign up for whatever
interests you, OK?

373
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,788
We're gonna get
on the astronomy line...

374
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,832
before it closes up.
See you later.

375
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:08,630
Look at this.
This is worse than the track.

376
00:23:08,671 --> 00:23:10,298
You want me to move
some people for you?

377
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,382
No, don't push anybody around.

378
00:23:11,424 --> 00:23:14,010
This is college.
Let me think for a minute.

379
00:23:14,052 --> 00:23:15,637
What are you gonna do?

380
00:23:15,678 --> 00:23:18,056
Come on. I got an idea.

381
00:23:18,097 --> 00:23:19,057
Did you get
everything you want?

382
00:23:19,098 --> 00:23:21,809
I got the Latin
and the Sanskrit...

383
00:23:21,851 --> 00:23:23,519
but then they canceled
my Ancient Greek.

384
00:23:23,561 --> 00:23:25,521
Just blew my whole
dead languages motif.

385
00:23:25,563 --> 00:23:27,690
What are you looking at?

386
00:23:41,496 --> 00:23:43,957
You OK?

387
00:23:43,998 --> 00:23:47,502
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

388
00:23:48,644 --> 00:23:51,021
I'm just upset
because they closed botany.

389
00:23:51,063 --> 00:23:53,023
Those bastards!

390
00:23:53,065 --> 00:23:55,233
Well, I'm not that upset.

391
00:23:56,568 --> 00:23:59,321
At least, I won't be
if I get into astronomy.

392
00:23:59,363 --> 00:24:01,657
You want to cut
into line with us?

393
00:24:01,698 --> 00:24:02,741
'Cause we're already waiting.

394
00:24:02,783 --> 00:24:05,619
Yes. Yeah, I would.

395
00:24:05,661 --> 00:24:06,745
Great. All right.

396
00:24:10,666 --> 00:24:12,542
Oh, this is Derek.

397
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:15,420
Hi.

398
00:24:15,462 --> 00:24:17,214
I'm Valerie Desmond.

399
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:19,257
Yeah, I know.

400
00:24:20,634 --> 00:24:23,595
- I'm Jason Melon.
- Hi.

401
00:24:27,683 --> 00:24:29,893
- Hey, Valerie.
- Hi.

402
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:31,395
God, you look great.

403
00:24:31,436 --> 00:24:34,022
Thanks. Are you taking
astronomy, too?

404
00:24:34,064 --> 00:24:35,983
Yeah, I guess so.

405
00:24:36,024 --> 00:24:38,068
I don't really want to.
I'm a business major.

406
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:41,154
But for some reason,
they want us to take a science.

407
00:24:41,196 --> 00:24:43,156
You mind if I sneak
in the line with you?

408
00:24:43,198 --> 00:24:46,118
Actually, these guys were
nice enough to let me in...

409
00:24:46,153 --> 00:24:49,538
so it's really
up to them, I guess.

410
00:24:49,579 --> 00:24:51,331
Melon, buddy?

411
00:24:51,373 --> 00:24:53,834
Whaddaya say? Let me in, OK?

412
00:24:53,875 --> 00:24:56,378
I don't think so, Osbourne.

413
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,463
Melon, your friend...
straighten him out.

414
00:24:58,505 --> 00:25:00,048
Look, Chas,
there's a lot of people waiting.

415
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:02,718
It wouldn't really be fair.

416
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:03,844
I'll tell you what.

417
00:25:03,885 --> 00:25:07,973
Maybe if you got a note
from each of these people...

418
00:25:08,015 --> 00:25:10,142
saying that it was all right,
then we'd reconsider...

419
00:25:10,183 --> 00:25:12,019
but until that day,
take a hike...

420
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:15,147
you elitist fraternity scumbag.

421
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:20,861
I won't forget this, Melon.

422
00:25:20,902 --> 00:25:22,696
I'll see you at the pool.

423
00:25:22,738 --> 00:25:24,072
- Bye, Val.
- Bye.

424
00:25:24,114 --> 00:25:25,706
Thank you. I'm dead.

425
00:25:25,741 --> 00:25:27,743
You're not gonna believe this!

426
00:25:27,784 --> 00:25:30,370
- You're kidding!
- I'm not kidding! Just go!

427
00:25:30,412 --> 00:25:32,080
He's out there!

428
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:45,636
Bruce! Bruce! Bruce! Bruce!

429
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:51,933
Where is he?

430
00:25:51,975 --> 00:25:53,101
I don't know, kid.

431
00:25:53,185 --> 00:25:54,895
All I know is I'm supposed
to pick him up here.

432
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,897
- When?
- Now.

433
00:25:56,938 --> 00:25:59,608
Come on, let's register.

434
00:26:08,283 --> 00:26:09,826
Hey, you guys
get everything you need?

435
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:11,119
Oh, yeah, we got it.

436
00:26:11,161 --> 00:26:12,746
Good. What's with
the used books?

437
00:26:12,788 --> 00:26:15,207
- What's wrong with used books?
- They've already been read.

438
00:26:15,248 --> 00:26:17,042
And they've already been
underlined.

439
00:26:17,084 --> 00:26:18,293
That's the problem.

440
00:26:18,335 --> 00:26:20,587
The guy who underlined them
could have been a maniac.

441
00:26:20,671 --> 00:26:23,966
Get these guys some new books.

442
00:26:24,007 --> 00:26:26,927
Charge it to me, too.
Here, pick a card.

443
00:26:28,136 --> 00:26:30,931
And I'm taking four
of those school sweaters...

444
00:26:30,973 --> 00:26:33,600
a bunch of pennants,
some of those beer mugs...

445
00:26:33,642 --> 00:26:36,269
a few of these fuzz balls
you cheer with, and...

446
00:26:36,311 --> 00:26:39,564
Hey, folks, it's on me!
Shakespeare for everyone, OK?

447
00:26:41,149 --> 00:26:44,111
You, too, honey.
I'd like to tame your shrew.

448
00:26:44,152 --> 00:26:47,990
- Who is that?
- That is Mr. Thornton Melon...

449
00:26:48,031 --> 00:26:50,659
the world's oldest
living freshman...

450
00:26:50,701 --> 00:26:53,745
and the walking epitome of
the decline of modern education.

451
00:26:53,787 --> 00:26:56,164
The stupid clod thinks he can
buy his way out of the gutter.

452
00:26:56,206 --> 00:26:58,507
I don't think so.
He was just having fun.

453
00:26:58,542 --> 00:27:03,213
Oh, really? Well, I can't wait
to get him in my class.

454
00:27:03,255 --> 00:27:05,382
We'll see how much fun
he is then.

455
00:27:05,424 --> 00:27:06,633
Oh, Philip.

456
00:27:06,675 --> 00:27:09,678
Hey, Mr. M! You're all set.
We've been working all night.

457
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,263
We got it all done.

458
00:27:11,305 --> 00:27:13,140
Thanks, Buzzy.
I appreciate it.

459
00:27:13,181 --> 00:27:16,435
Add a few hundred to the bill
and throw your boys a party.

460
00:27:16,476 --> 00:27:19,604
You know what you got, Mr. M?
You got class.

461
00:27:19,646 --> 00:27:22,858
It rubbed off from you, Buzzy.
Say hello to Sonia for me, huh?

462
00:27:22,899 --> 00:27:24,109
You got it.

463
00:27:24,151 --> 00:27:27,029
I want to talk to you
about my schedule.

464
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:29,239
We'll go over it later.

465
00:27:42,044 --> 00:27:44,421
Well, boys,
what do you think?

466
00:27:44,456 --> 00:27:46,340
Got a hot tub in there!

467
00:27:46,381 --> 00:27:48,550
How can you study
if you're not relaxed?

468
00:27:48,592 --> 00:27:49,676
When's our first class?

469
00:27:49,718 --> 00:27:51,887
We got economics
tomorrow at 11:00.

470
00:27:51,928 --> 00:27:53,096
11:00? No good.

471
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:55,307
I got a massage at 11:00.
Tell them to make it 2:00.

472
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:58,518
No, Dad, you don't get it.

473
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:02,689
They're not gonna reschedule
the classes around your massage.

474
00:28:02,731 --> 00:28:05,233
All right, 11:00.
But I'm gonna talk to that dean.

475
00:28:05,275 --> 00:28:07,819
These classes can be
a real inconvenience.

476
00:28:07,861 --> 00:28:10,322
All right, settle down, people.

477
00:28:10,364 --> 00:28:13,367
We've got a lot to cover,
and time is short.

478
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:20,207
There are two kinds of people
in business today...

479
00:28:20,248 --> 00:28:22,209
the quick and the dead.

480
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:25,379
So, rather than waste
your time this semester...

481
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,839
with a lot of
useless theories...

482
00:28:27,923 --> 00:28:29,883
we're going to jump right in
with both feet...

483
00:28:29,925 --> 00:28:32,844
and create a fictional company
from the ground up.

484
00:28:32,886 --> 00:28:35,889
We'll construct
our physical plant...

485
00:28:35,931 --> 00:28:38,392
we'll set up
an efficient administrative...

486
00:28:38,433 --> 00:28:40,227
and executive structure...

487
00:28:40,268 --> 00:28:43,779
then we'll manufacture
our product and market it.

488
00:28:43,814 --> 00:28:46,525
I think you'll find it very
interesting and a lot of fun.

489
00:28:46,566 --> 00:28:50,070
So, let's start by looking
at construction costs...

490
00:28:50,112 --> 00:28:52,239
of our new factory.

491
00:28:52,274 --> 00:28:54,366
What's the product?

492
00:28:54,449 --> 00:28:55,617
That is immaterial...

493
00:28:55,659 --> 00:28:57,786
for the purposes
of our discussion here...

494
00:28:57,828 --> 00:28:59,579
but if it makes you happy...

495
00:28:59,621 --> 00:29:01,790
let's say we're making
tape recorders.

496
00:29:01,832 --> 00:29:03,834
Tape recorders?
Are you kiddin'?

497
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:07,337
The Japs will kill us
on the labor costs.

498
00:29:07,379 --> 00:29:09,339
OK, fine.

499
00:29:09,381 --> 00:29:12,134
Then let's just say
they're widgets.

500
00:29:12,175 --> 00:29:14,094
What's a widget?

501
00:29:14,136 --> 00:29:17,431
It's a fictional product.
It doesn't matter.

502
00:29:17,472 --> 00:29:19,516
Doesn't matter.
Tell that to the bank.

503
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:21,685
Take it easy.
It's the first day.

504
00:29:21,727 --> 00:29:25,188
On the board,
you will see a cost analysis...

505
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,774
for construction of
a 30,000 square-foot facility...

506
00:29:27,816 --> 00:29:30,569
which will encompass
both factory and office space...

507
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:33,488
and is fully serviced
by all utilities...

508
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:36,700
a railroad spur line
and a four-bay shipping dock.

509
00:29:36,742 --> 00:29:39,828
Hold it, hold it. Why build?
You're better off leasing...

510
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:42,331
at a buck and a quarter,
a buck and a half a square foot.

511
00:29:42,372 --> 00:29:45,083
Take your down payment
and put it into CDs...

512
00:29:45,125 --> 00:29:47,377
or something else you can roll
over every couple of months.

513
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:48,920
Thank you, Mr. Melon...

514
00:29:48,962 --> 00:29:51,757
but we'll be concentrating
on finance...

515
00:29:51,798 --> 00:29:54,343
a little later in the term.

516
00:29:54,384 --> 00:29:56,553
For the time being,
let's just concentrate...

517
00:29:56,595 --> 00:29:58,895
on the construction figures,
shall we?

518
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:02,142
You'll see the final bottom line
requires the factoring in...

519
00:30:02,184 --> 00:30:04,686
of not just the material
and construction costs...

520
00:30:04,728 --> 00:30:09,608
but also the architects' fees
and the cost of land servicing.

521
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:12,027
Oh, you left out
a bunch of stuff.

522
00:30:12,069 --> 00:30:13,987
Oh, really?

523
00:30:14,029 --> 00:30:16,073
Like what, for instance?

524
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:19,409
First of all, you have to grease
the local politicians...

525
00:30:19,451 --> 00:30:21,662
for the sudden zoning problems
that always come up.

526
00:30:21,703 --> 00:30:24,289
Then there's the kickbacks
to the carpenters.

527
00:30:24,331 --> 00:30:26,291
And if you plan on using
any cement in this building...

528
00:30:26,333 --> 00:30:27,834
I'm sure the teamsters
would like to have...

529
00:30:27,876 --> 00:30:29,920
a little chat with you,
and that'll cost you.

530
00:30:29,962 --> 00:30:32,631
Don't forget a little something
for the building inspectors.

531
00:30:32,673 --> 00:30:35,759
There's the long-term costs,
such as waste disposal.

532
00:30:35,801 --> 00:30:37,844
I don't know if you're familiar
with who runs that business...

533
00:30:37,886 --> 00:30:39,930
but I assure you
it's not the boy scouts.

534
00:30:39,972 --> 00:30:41,390
That will be quite enough,
Mr. Melon.

535
00:30:41,431 --> 00:30:43,558
Maybe bribes and kickbacks...

536
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,895
and Mafia payoffs
are how you do business...

537
00:30:46,937 --> 00:30:49,773
but they are not part of
the legitimate business world...

538
00:30:49,815 --> 00:30:51,650
and they're certainly
not part of anything...

539
00:30:51,692 --> 00:30:54,152
I'm teaching in this class.
Do I make myself clear?

540
00:30:54,187 --> 00:30:57,030
Sorry. Just trying to help.
That's all.

541
00:30:57,072 --> 00:31:02,119
Now, notwithstanding
Mr. Melon's input...

542
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:06,290
the next question for us is
where to build our factory.

543
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:08,750
How about Fantasyland?

544
00:31:12,296 --> 00:31:15,215
My first class.
I did good, huh?

545
00:31:15,257 --> 00:31:17,634
You better cool it
with Dr. Barbay.

546
00:31:17,676 --> 00:31:19,428
Dr. Barbay, he don't know dick.

547
00:31:19,469 --> 00:31:21,388
He really tells it
like it ain't.

548
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:24,016
Know what he knows how to do?
Flunk you.

549
00:31:24,099 --> 00:31:26,435
Flunk me? Flunk him.

550
00:31:26,476 --> 00:31:29,271
Great attitude. Do you know
where your next class is?

551
00:31:29,313 --> 00:31:32,274
Contemporary American history.
Professor Turgeson.

552
00:31:32,316 --> 00:31:34,735
- Turgeson?
- You know him? Is he good?

553
00:31:34,776 --> 00:31:37,029
Well, he's really committed.

554
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:39,281
In fact, I think he was.
Just keep your head down...

555
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:41,074
and your mouth shut.
You should be all right.

556
00:31:41,116 --> 00:31:42,701
- I'll see you in English.
- All right.

557
00:31:42,743 --> 00:31:46,246
Welcome to Contemporary
American history.

558
00:31:46,288 --> 00:31:48,415
I'm Professor Turgeson.

559
00:31:48,457 --> 00:31:50,959
I know a lot of people
think history is just facts...

560
00:31:51,001 --> 00:31:55,005
just information about the past,
but not me.

561
00:31:55,047 --> 00:31:58,342
I hold history
very sacred. Sacred.

562
00:31:58,383 --> 00:32:00,927
The way a farmer looks at
the Earth and holds it sacred.

563
00:32:00,962 --> 00:32:02,971
The way a Christian
takes the Bible...

564
00:32:03,013 --> 00:32:04,222
and he holds it sacred.

565
00:32:04,264 --> 00:32:07,184
The way a lot of people
hold their marriage sacred.

566
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:09,561
That's how I feel about it.
So why don't we dive right in...

567
00:32:09,603 --> 00:32:12,606
by interpreting
one of the easiest events...

568
00:32:12,641 --> 00:32:15,609
in the last twenty years
of American history.

569
00:32:15,651 --> 00:32:18,111
Now, can someone tell me...

570
00:32:18,153 --> 00:32:22,532
why, in 1975, we pulled
our troops out of Vietnam?

571
00:32:24,034 --> 00:32:26,828
The failure of Vietnamization
to win popular support...

572
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:28,830
caused an ongoing erosion
of confidence...

573
00:32:28,872 --> 00:32:32,125
in the various American...
but illegal... Saigon regimes.

574
00:32:36,505 --> 00:32:37,714
Is she right?

575
00:32:39,925 --> 00:32:41,510
'Cause I know
that's the popular version...

576
00:32:41,551 --> 00:32:42,844
of what went on there.

577
00:32:42,886 --> 00:32:44,972
I know a lot of people
like to believe that.

578
00:32:45,013 --> 00:32:47,015
I wish I could,
but I was there.

579
00:32:47,057 --> 00:32:48,600
I wasn't here in a classroom...

580
00:32:48,642 --> 00:32:50,143
hoping I was right,
thinking about it.

581
00:32:50,185 --> 00:32:52,938
I was up to my knees
in rice paddies...

582
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:55,399
with guns that didn't work,
going up against Charlie...

583
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,360
slugging it out with him,
while pussies like you...

584
00:32:58,402 --> 00:33:01,321
were back here partyin',
puttin' headbands on...

585
00:33:01,363 --> 00:33:04,241
doin' drugs, listening
to the goddamn Beatle albums!

586
00:33:06,994 --> 00:33:08,870
Hey, Professor,
take it easy, will ya?

587
00:33:08,912 --> 00:33:11,790
These kids were in grade school
at the time.

588
00:33:11,832 --> 00:33:13,166
And me...

589
00:33:13,208 --> 00:33:16,003
I'm not a fighter, I'm a lover.

590
00:33:19,881 --> 00:33:22,801
Well, I didn't know you wanted
to get involved...

591
00:33:22,843 --> 00:33:26,179
with the discussion,
Mr. Helper.

592
00:33:26,221 --> 00:33:29,683
But since you want to help,
maybe you can help me, OK?

593
00:33:29,725 --> 00:33:31,643
You remember that thing
we had about thirty years ago...

594
00:33:31,678 --> 00:33:33,020
called the Korean conflict?

595
00:33:33,061 --> 00:33:36,231
Yeah. Where we failed
to achieve victory.

596
00:33:36,273 --> 00:33:38,734
How come we didn't cross
the 38th parallel...

597
00:33:38,775 --> 00:33:41,820
and push those rice-eaters back
to the Great Wall of China...

598
00:33:41,862 --> 00:33:43,864
and take it apart
brick by brick...

599
00:33:43,905 --> 00:33:46,241
and nuke them back into
the fuckin' stone age forever?

600
00:33:46,283 --> 00:33:49,786
How come? Tell me?
Why? Say it! Say it!

601
00:33:49,828 --> 00:33:51,997
All right, I'll say it.

602
00:33:52,039 --> 00:33:54,124
'Cause Truman was too much
of a pussy wimp...

603
00:33:54,166 --> 00:33:57,753
to let MacArthur go in and blow
out those commie bastards!

604
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:02,633
Good answer. Good answer.

605
00:34:04,092 --> 00:34:06,845
I like the way you think.

606
00:34:06,887 --> 00:34:10,265
I'm gonna be watching you.

607
00:34:12,476 --> 00:34:15,771
Good teacher.
He really seems to care.

608
00:34:15,812 --> 00:34:18,106
About what, I have no idea.

609
00:34:19,191 --> 00:34:21,068
College is all right,
I'll tell you that.

610
00:34:21,109 --> 00:34:23,445
Hey, buddy, be my guest.
Here's a pen.

611
00:34:23,487 --> 00:34:27,282
Boys, here's a couple of pens,
in case you learn how to write.

612
00:34:27,324 --> 00:34:29,597
- I know you.
- Oh, yeah? Here's a pen.

613
00:34:29,632 --> 00:34:31,870
You do those
obnoxious commercials.

614
00:34:31,912 --> 00:34:33,205
You're tall and fat.

615
00:34:33,246 --> 00:34:37,250
Yeah, you're short and ugly.
Give me the pen back, will ya?

616
00:34:37,292 --> 00:34:39,503
Honey, here's a pen.

617
00:34:39,544 --> 00:34:41,964
Boys, how are ya?

618
00:35:03,819 --> 00:35:05,278
"And Gibraltar is a girl...

619
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,948
"where I was a flower
of the mountain.

620
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:09,950
"Yes, when I put
the rose in my hair...

621
00:35:09,992 --> 00:35:11,493
"like the
Andalusian girls used.

622
00:35:11,535 --> 00:35:13,537
"Or shall I wear red?

623
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:16,415
"Yes. And how he kissed me
under the Moorish wall...

624
00:35:16,456 --> 00:35:17,582
"and I thought...

625
00:35:17,624 --> 00:35:19,543
"well, as well him as another.

626
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:21,878
"And then I ask him
with my eyes to ask again.

627
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,590
"Yes. And then he asked me
would I yes to say yes.

628
00:35:25,632 --> 00:35:27,175
"My mountain flower.

629
00:35:27,217 --> 00:35:29,511
"And first I put my arms
around him, yes...

630
00:35:29,553 --> 00:35:31,013
"and drew him down to me...

631
00:35:31,054 --> 00:35:33,682
"so he could feel my breasts
all perfumed, yes...

632
00:35:33,724 --> 00:35:36,018
"and his heart was going
like mad, and yes...

633
00:35:36,059 --> 00:35:38,061
"I said, yes, I will, yes. "

634
00:35:38,103 --> 00:35:41,315
Yes! Yes!

635
00:35:46,486 --> 00:35:48,447
Thanks for the vote
of confidence.

636
00:35:48,488 --> 00:35:49,990
I think Joyce
is pretty hot, too.

637
00:35:50,032 --> 00:35:51,867
And now that
I've got your attention...

638
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:53,368
I'd like to run down
the reading list...

639
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:56,413
for the semester.
See what else turns you on.

640
00:36:02,336 --> 00:36:04,046
What a woman.

641
00:36:04,129 --> 00:36:06,423
Dad, she is the teacher.

642
00:36:06,465 --> 00:36:07,966
I know. I like teachers.

643
00:36:08,008 --> 00:36:10,344
If you do something wrong,
they make you do it over again.

644
00:36:12,095 --> 00:36:14,598
Don't you think maybe
you should just take some notes?

645
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,184
Yeah, yeah.

646
00:36:17,225 --> 00:36:21,146
I gave away all my pens.

647
00:36:21,188 --> 00:36:23,482
I'm sorry. I need this back.

648
00:36:23,517 --> 00:36:25,776
Here's a calendar for you.

649
00:36:29,071 --> 00:36:30,280
Oh, hiya.

650
00:36:30,322 --> 00:36:33,200
Hello, Mr. Melon.
You waiting for me?

651
00:36:33,241 --> 00:36:35,953
Yes, I was. Look,
I know I'm only a freshman...

652
00:36:35,994 --> 00:36:38,330
but what do you say
you and I have dinner tonight?

653
00:36:38,372 --> 00:36:41,583
We could talk about Joyce.
She's my favorite writer.

654
00:36:43,627 --> 00:36:46,213
You're not the usual freshman,
but I'm sorry, I can't.

655
00:36:46,254 --> 00:36:48,090
The thing is,
I'm sort of going with someone.

656
00:36:48,131 --> 00:36:50,300
Oh. Where you going?

657
00:36:50,342 --> 00:36:52,809
That's a good question.

658
00:36:52,844 --> 00:36:55,555
Actually, I'd like to join you,
but I have class tonight.

659
00:36:55,597 --> 00:36:58,850
- How about tomorrow night?
- I have class then, too.

660
00:36:58,892 --> 00:37:00,602
I'll tell you what, then.

661
00:37:00,644 --> 00:37:04,606
Why don't you call me
when you have no class?

662
00:37:04,648 --> 00:37:06,900
All right. Maybe I will.

663
00:37:12,781 --> 00:37:15,242
Hello, Philip.

664
00:37:15,283 --> 00:37:17,452
What did he want?

665
00:37:17,494 --> 00:37:20,372
Oh, what do all men want?

666
00:37:20,414 --> 00:37:22,332
He wants you to dress up
as Wonder Woman...

667
00:37:22,374 --> 00:37:25,919
tie him up with a golden lariat
and force him to tell the truth?

668
00:37:25,961 --> 00:37:28,297
No, just dinner, Philip.

669
00:37:28,338 --> 00:37:31,425
Are you jealous
of Thornton Melon?

670
00:37:31,466 --> 00:37:33,552
Certainly not.

671
00:37:33,593 --> 00:37:36,513
I've been doing a great deal
of thinking lately.

672
00:37:36,555 --> 00:37:39,766
I've been thinking about us.

673
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:42,311
- And?
- And I think...

674
00:37:42,352 --> 00:37:45,731
we should start thinking
about forming a...

675
00:37:45,772 --> 00:37:47,482
well, um...

676
00:37:47,524 --> 00:37:48,650
A merger?

677
00:37:48,692 --> 00:37:51,111
A merger, exactly.
Exactly, a merger.

678
00:37:51,153 --> 00:37:53,655
A partnership.
Seriously, Diane...

679
00:37:53,697 --> 00:37:56,450
we're both intelligent,
well-educated adults.

680
00:37:56,491 --> 00:38:00,746
We should be together.
Incorporated, if you will.

681
00:38:00,787 --> 00:38:05,917
Look at the balance sheet.
We were made for one another.

682
00:38:05,959 --> 00:38:07,252
Oh, Philip, you darling.

683
00:38:07,294 --> 00:38:09,504
I don't want to be merged
or incorporated.

684
00:38:09,546 --> 00:38:13,383
I want to have fun
and be romanced and be loved.

685
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:17,346
So let's not rush
into anything.

686
00:38:17,387 --> 00:38:20,265
Let's just start
by having fun, OK?

687
00:38:24,186 --> 00:38:26,521
Hey, how are you?
What's happening?

688
00:38:26,563 --> 00:38:27,738
Hi!

689
00:38:27,773 --> 00:38:29,691
A lot of people are talking
about your dad, man.

690
00:38:29,775 --> 00:38:31,652
What's happening?

691
00:38:31,693 --> 00:38:34,488
Hey, boys, how ya doin'?

692
00:38:34,529 --> 00:38:36,907
I wonder why.

693
00:38:38,367 --> 00:38:40,077
They have lockers.

694
00:38:40,118 --> 00:38:42,245
You could've changed here.

695
00:38:42,287 --> 00:38:44,289
I don't change
in front of guys.

696
00:38:44,331 --> 00:38:46,208
Next thing you know, you're
showering with the fellas.

697
00:38:46,249 --> 00:38:47,584
And the next thing you know...

698
00:38:47,626 --> 00:38:49,586
you're pinned to a sophomore
named Chip.

699
00:38:49,628 --> 00:38:51,171
Come on, let's go, huh?

700
00:38:51,213 --> 00:38:52,756
I'll see you later.

701
00:39:23,578 --> 00:39:25,998
That was pretty good.

702
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:27,833
Next time, hold the pike
a little longer.

703
00:39:30,043 --> 00:39:32,129
Wait a minute.
I'll be right down.

704
00:39:56,111 --> 00:39:58,530
Not bad.

705
00:39:58,572 --> 00:40:01,074
All right, let's see one more.

706
00:40:02,284 --> 00:40:03,702
Like I showed you.

707
00:40:03,737 --> 00:40:04,870
All right.

708
00:40:10,876 --> 00:40:13,795
What's a guy your age
doing here with these kids?

709
00:40:13,837 --> 00:40:17,424
I'm lookin' for the fountain
of middle age.

710
00:40:17,459 --> 00:40:18,800
What's your story?

711
00:40:18,842 --> 00:40:21,345
I'm setting the new record for
the most consecutive losses...

712
00:40:21,386 --> 00:40:24,264
by a diving coach
in this conference.

713
00:40:24,306 --> 00:40:26,600
Hey, remember,
hold that pike longer.

714
00:40:26,635 --> 00:40:28,894
- That your kid?
- Yeah.

715
00:40:28,935 --> 00:40:31,188
Who coached him in high school?

716
00:40:31,229 --> 00:40:32,731
Yours truly.

717
00:40:32,773 --> 00:40:34,399
So, where did you learn
how to dive?

718
00:40:34,441 --> 00:40:37,861
Atlantic City. The Steel Pier.
I was in the water show.

719
00:40:37,903 --> 00:40:39,404
I used to open
for the diving horse.

720
00:40:39,488 --> 00:40:41,365
You're kiddin'.
I'm from Jersey.

721
00:40:41,406 --> 00:40:44,743
I practically spent
my entire life on that pier.

722
00:40:44,785 --> 00:40:47,371
There was a guy,
did the most amazing dive...

723
00:40:47,412 --> 00:40:49,039
called the Triple Lindy.

724
00:40:49,081 --> 00:40:50,791
Hardest dive
I ever saw in my life.

725
00:40:50,832 --> 00:40:53,543
- Who was that guy?
- Yours truly.

726
00:40:53,585 --> 00:40:55,003
You're kiddin'.

727
00:40:55,045 --> 00:40:56,838
I don't joke about dives.

728
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,674
Especially that one.
It almost killed me.

729
00:40:58,715 --> 00:41:01,760
Boy, you were somethin' else.

730
00:41:01,802 --> 00:41:03,804
Hey, can your kid do that dive?

731
00:41:03,845 --> 00:41:06,932
Nah, nobody can.
It's too dangerous.

732
00:41:06,974 --> 00:41:09,935
You know, he tried out
for the team last semester.

733
00:41:09,977 --> 00:41:11,311
He didn't do that good.

734
00:41:11,353 --> 00:41:14,356
Not that good, huh? Watch this.

735
00:41:14,398 --> 00:41:17,150
Jason, do the two and a half!

736
00:41:31,832 --> 00:41:33,959
Not bad.

737
00:41:35,669 --> 00:41:36,962
My main Melon.
Come on, man...

738
00:41:37,004 --> 00:41:38,505
there's a pep rally
for the football team.

739
00:41:38,588 --> 00:41:40,549
- Let's go. We're there.
- Whoa, wait. What is this?

740
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:43,844
Me and Standish and Redding
are doing the anti-pep rally...

741
00:41:43,885 --> 00:41:46,680
to point out that a violent
ground acquisition game...

742
00:41:46,722 --> 00:41:47,973
such as football is, in fact...

743
00:41:48,015 --> 00:41:49,850
a crypto-fascist metaphor
for nuclear war.

744
00:41:49,891 --> 00:41:51,977
It sounds like
a lot of laughs...

745
00:41:52,019 --> 00:41:53,312
but I'm supposed
to meet my dad and study.

746
00:41:53,395 --> 00:41:54,855
He's supposed
to be here already.

747
00:41:54,896 --> 00:41:56,857
OK, well...

748
00:41:56,898 --> 00:41:59,985
if you change your mind, pal,
you know where I'll be.

749
00:42:00,027 --> 00:42:03,697
If I change my mind,
I'll seek psychiatric help.

750
00:42:22,507 --> 00:42:23,717
Excuse me.

751
00:42:23,759 --> 00:42:27,220
What is the Oort system
and what does it tell us?

752
00:42:29,222 --> 00:42:31,183
What? I'm sorry.

753
00:42:31,224 --> 00:42:34,686
Astronomy, chapter two.

754
00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:36,903
Oh, Oort, Oort.

755
00:42:36,938 --> 00:42:39,524
Oort was this scientist,
and he figured out...

756
00:42:39,566 --> 00:42:43,904
that the smeared-out density
of matter can be no greater...

757
00:42:43,945 --> 00:42:47,115
than the solar mass
per cubic parsec.

758
00:42:47,157 --> 00:42:49,201
You look thrilled.
It's not my theory.

759
00:42:50,577 --> 00:42:53,622
Thanks, that helps a lot.

760
00:42:54,623 --> 00:42:56,757
Listen, I was
just wondering...

761
00:42:56,792 --> 00:42:58,377
would you do
my astronomy homework...

762
00:42:58,418 --> 00:42:59,962
for the rest of the semester?

763
00:43:02,714 --> 00:43:04,883
- Here you go.
- OK, right.

764
00:43:04,925 --> 00:43:06,259
Hi, Mr. Melon.

765
00:43:06,301 --> 00:43:08,929
Oh, you can call me Thornton.

766
00:43:08,971 --> 00:43:11,890
Say, how about joining me
and my friend over there?

767
00:43:11,932 --> 00:43:13,892
Your friend looks
a little strange.

768
00:43:13,976 --> 00:43:16,937
Who, Lou? Lou's an animal.
Why, in his family...

769
00:43:16,979 --> 00:43:21,316
he's only the second generation
that's standing up straight.

770
00:43:21,358 --> 00:43:22,818
What lovely girls.

771
00:43:22,859 --> 00:43:25,904
How would you like a life
of luxury and deceit?

772
00:43:25,946 --> 00:43:28,281
Come on, join us in a beer. OK?

773
00:43:28,323 --> 00:43:30,284
- Yeah, OK.
- OK.

774
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:43,130
Girls, this is Lou.
Lou, these are girls.

775
00:43:46,216 --> 00:43:50,429
One, two.

776
00:43:57,185 --> 00:43:59,313
Shake it up, baby

777
00:44:01,148 --> 00:44:03,275
Twist and shout

778
00:44:04,985 --> 00:44:07,070
Come on, come on, come on, baby

779
00:44:09,072 --> 00:44:11,325
Come and work it on out

780
00:44:13,201 --> 00:44:15,662
Work it on out, honey

781
00:44:17,539 --> 00:44:20,667
Honey, come here. I need
2 more glasses for the girls...

782
00:44:20,709 --> 00:44:23,003
and also,
bring a pitcher of beer...

783
00:44:23,086 --> 00:44:25,130
every seven minutes
till somebody passes out.

784
00:44:25,172 --> 00:44:26,923
And then bring one
every ten minutes.

785
00:44:26,965 --> 00:44:28,383
You got it. Anyway...

786
00:44:28,425 --> 00:44:30,886
I thought we were gonna go...

787
00:44:30,927 --> 00:44:33,597
to the planetarium
and look at a lot of stars.

788
00:44:33,639 --> 00:44:36,350
I had no idea this was
gonna be astrophysics.

789
00:44:36,391 --> 00:44:39,061
It's not that hard.
You'll get it.

790
00:44:39,102 --> 00:44:42,522
It's not hard for you,
because you're smart.

791
00:44:42,564 --> 00:44:44,650
You're smart, too.

792
00:44:44,691 --> 00:44:47,110
Yeah, but you're, like,
"smart" smart.

793
00:44:47,152 --> 00:44:49,112
Do you study at the library
every night?

794
00:44:49,154 --> 00:44:50,697
No. I was gonna meet
my dad there...

795
00:44:50,739 --> 00:44:52,115
but he must be studying
at the dorm.

796
00:45:02,918 --> 00:45:04,920
Shake it up, baby

797
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:08,423
Twist and shout

798
00:45:10,384 --> 00:45:12,594
Come on, come on, come on, baby

799
00:45:14,429 --> 00:45:16,765
Come on and work it on out

800
00:45:18,433 --> 00:45:20,310
You know you twist it,
little girl

801
00:45:20,352 --> 00:45:21,985
Lower, baby, lower.

802
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:24,606
Hey, guys,
let me see some I.D.

803
00:45:24,648 --> 00:45:26,566
Not that low, baby.

804
00:45:26,608 --> 00:45:28,902
Come on and twist a little
closer now

805
00:45:28,944 --> 00:45:30,696
To the left, baby, to the left.

806
00:45:30,737 --> 00:45:32,280
And let me know you're mine

807
00:45:32,364 --> 00:45:33,573
That's the spot, baby.

808
00:45:33,615 --> 00:45:36,702
Hold it, hold it!
Oh, you are there!

809
00:45:36,743 --> 00:45:38,745
Shake it, baby

810
00:45:38,787 --> 00:45:42,416
Shake it, shake it, baby

811
00:45:42,457 --> 00:45:46,253
Come on and shake it,
shake it, shake it, baby

812
00:45:48,297 --> 00:45:50,090
- Shake it now
- Shake it

813
00:46:01,143 --> 00:46:02,477
OK, go ahead.

814
00:46:06,189 --> 00:46:08,400
Jason, what are you doing here?

815
00:46:08,442 --> 00:46:11,611
What am I doing here?
What are you doing here?

816
00:46:11,653 --> 00:46:13,864
We were supposed to study,
remember, in the library?

817
00:46:13,905 --> 00:46:15,824
The library.
I was supposed to be there.

818
00:46:15,866 --> 00:46:18,243
Hey, what's going on?

819
00:46:18,285 --> 00:46:20,245
Chas, check it out.

820
00:46:23,373 --> 00:46:25,500
Hey, Clark.

821
00:46:25,542 --> 00:46:27,461
Interesting little rally
you guys had tonight.

822
00:46:27,502 --> 00:46:30,422
Yeah, right. They got paint
all over my girlfriend.

823
00:46:30,464 --> 00:46:32,341
I'm gonna kill
them little pinheads.

824
00:46:32,424 --> 00:46:34,217
Yeah? Well, you came
to the right place...

825
00:46:34,259 --> 00:46:36,637
because guess who's here...
Derek Lutz.

826
00:46:42,726 --> 00:46:45,228
Hey, Lutz!

827
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:46,855
You know who I am?

828
00:46:46,897 --> 00:46:48,774
Let me see...

829
00:46:48,815 --> 00:46:51,901
protruding
supra-orbital ridges...

830
00:46:51,936 --> 00:46:54,988
small cranium,
1,300 C.C. Brain...

831
00:46:55,030 --> 00:46:56,239
Neanderthal man.

832
00:46:56,281 --> 00:46:59,326
You... I want you
to call his mother.

833
00:46:59,368 --> 00:47:01,161
You tell her
he's never coming home.

834
00:47:01,203 --> 00:47:03,789
Whoa, hold it. You sure
you even got the right guy?

835
00:47:03,830 --> 00:47:05,624
Look how many people
got blue hair these days.

836
00:47:05,666 --> 00:47:07,125
Shut up, meathead.

837
00:47:07,167 --> 00:47:08,460
Take it easy, will ya?

838
00:47:08,502 --> 00:47:12,255
I mean, the war's over.
Get new parts for your head.

839
00:47:12,297 --> 00:47:14,967
Yeah? Want to make
something of it?

840
00:47:15,008 --> 00:47:18,387
Oh, no. I never get physical.
I just get upset...

841
00:47:18,428 --> 00:47:22,349
and when I get upset,
he gets physical.

842
00:47:29,731 --> 00:47:31,233
You got a problem?

843
00:47:31,274 --> 00:47:33,276
No, I haven't got a problem.

844
00:47:33,318 --> 00:47:35,696
Now you do.

845
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:47,666
Get him!

846
00:47:59,386 --> 00:48:00,595
Lou, where you been?

847
00:48:00,637 --> 00:48:02,514
I'm getting my ass kicked
all over the place!

848
00:48:28,332 --> 00:48:31,126
- Well, you look terrible.
- No, I'm all right.

849
00:48:31,168 --> 00:48:34,921
It's Lou I'm worried about.
He may lose his trigger finger.

850
00:48:34,963 --> 00:48:36,214
It serves you guys right.

851
00:48:36,256 --> 00:48:38,342
Why did you have to take on
the whole football team?

852
00:48:38,383 --> 00:48:39,551
They're not that tough.

853
00:48:39,593 --> 00:48:41,928
The football team
at my high school was tough.

854
00:48:41,970 --> 00:48:43,555
After they sacked
the quarterback...

855
00:48:43,597 --> 00:48:45,474
they went after his family.

856
00:48:47,893 --> 00:48:50,103
This morning we're going to look
at "The Great Gatsby"...

857
00:48:50,145 --> 00:48:52,272
by F. Scott Fitzgerald.

858
00:48:52,314 --> 00:48:55,692
Mr. Melon, how would you
characterize "The Great Gatsby?"

859
00:48:55,734 --> 00:48:57,653
Who, him?

860
00:48:57,694 --> 00:48:59,154
No, you.

861
00:48:59,196 --> 00:49:00,572
Me.

862
00:49:00,614 --> 00:49:03,659
Well, "The Great Gatsby,"
he was...

863
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:05,869
great.

864
00:49:08,997 --> 00:49:10,624
See me after class, Mr. Melon.

865
00:49:14,628 --> 00:49:16,505
I mean, please,
try to understand.

866
00:49:16,546 --> 00:49:18,090
I don't have
the background for this.

867
00:49:18,131 --> 00:49:19,431
The high school I went to...

868
00:49:19,466 --> 00:49:21,134
they asked a kid to prove
the law of gravity.

869
00:49:21,176 --> 00:49:24,930
He threw the teacher
out the window.

870
00:49:24,972 --> 00:49:28,725
I know what I need.
I need a tutor.

871
00:49:28,767 --> 00:49:31,186
What do you say? Come on.

872
00:49:31,228 --> 00:49:33,814
You got some spare time.

873
00:49:33,855 --> 00:49:35,148
All right, Mr. Melon.

874
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:37,192
I have some spare time
this evening.

875
00:49:37,227 --> 00:49:39,194
Why don't you come around
about 7:00?

876
00:49:39,236 --> 00:49:41,822
- Great.
- I'll give you my address.

877
00:49:42,990 --> 00:49:45,325
- Thanks.
- Please be on time.

878
00:49:45,367 --> 00:49:47,786
I'll be on time.

879
00:49:49,621 --> 00:49:51,540
What penmanship.

880
00:49:52,958 --> 00:49:56,670
"Everywhere the ceremony
of innocence is drowned;

881
00:49:56,712 --> 00:49:58,380
"The best
lack all conviction...

882
00:49:58,422 --> 00:50:01,675
"while the worst are full
of passionate intensity. "

883
00:50:01,717 --> 00:50:03,302
There's a lot
of other stuff here.

884
00:50:03,343 --> 00:50:07,556
Yeats goes on and on...
and here's the finish.

885
00:50:07,597 --> 00:50:10,767
"What rough beast,
its hour come round at last...

886
00:50:10,809 --> 00:50:13,687
"slouches towards Bethlehem
to be born?"

887
00:50:13,729 --> 00:50:15,397
What does that
make you think of?

888
00:50:15,439 --> 00:50:18,400
Rough beast. My ex-wife.

889
00:50:18,483 --> 00:50:19,818
Well, that's
one interpretation.

890
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:21,862
Not the right one,
but it's a start.

891
00:50:21,903 --> 00:50:23,905
Surely a man of your age
and experience...

892
00:50:23,947 --> 00:50:25,907
must have read some
of the things on my list.

893
00:50:25,949 --> 00:50:28,493
- What about "Macbeth"?
- I saw the movie.

894
00:50:28,535 --> 00:50:31,622
Orson Welles.
Great actor, big actor.

895
00:50:31,705 --> 00:50:34,207
He was a Tall and Fat
customer for years.

896
00:50:34,249 --> 00:50:35,500
How about
"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"?

897
00:50:35,542 --> 00:50:37,461
I saw the movie. Burl Ives.

898
00:50:37,502 --> 00:50:41,006
Great actor, extra stout.
He was a customer, too.

899
00:50:41,048 --> 00:50:43,717
- "Streetcar Named Desire. "
- Great movie. Marlon Brando.

900
00:50:43,759 --> 00:50:47,346
He wasn't that big then,
but he ballooned up nicely.

901
00:50:47,387 --> 00:50:50,098
I'd say pound for pound,
our finest American actor.

902
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:52,017
Don't you ever read?

903
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:55,646
Who has time? I see the movie.
I'm in and out in two hours.

904
00:50:55,687 --> 00:50:57,064
Oh, Thornton, don't you see?

905
00:50:57,105 --> 00:50:58,899
The reason you want
to read these works...

906
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:00,859
is so you can experience them
for yourself...

907
00:51:00,901 --> 00:51:03,737
so you can share the thoughts
and feelings of the writer...

908
00:51:03,779 --> 00:51:06,239
without the interference
of your actor and director...

909
00:51:06,323 --> 00:51:08,116
and professor's point of view
getting in the way...

910
00:51:08,158 --> 00:51:10,953
to truly share
and understand...

911
00:51:10,994 --> 00:51:12,913
the common feelings
of all mankind...

912
00:51:12,955 --> 00:51:15,207
the feelings of being alive.

913
00:51:16,833 --> 00:51:18,877
That was beautiful.

914
00:51:18,919 --> 00:51:20,837
I understand
what you're saying, too.

915
00:51:20,879 --> 00:51:22,756
I'm glad.
That makes me feel good.

916
00:51:22,798 --> 00:51:25,050
I got an idea.

917
00:51:25,092 --> 00:51:28,261
Let's keep talking over dinner.

918
00:51:28,303 --> 00:51:30,389
I'm supposed to meet
someone for dinner.

919
00:51:31,598 --> 00:51:34,101
I could cancel,
though, I guess.

920
00:51:34,142 --> 00:51:35,435
We are working, after all.

921
00:51:35,477 --> 00:51:37,312
You can't work
on an empty stomach.

922
00:51:37,354 --> 00:51:40,357
You can't concentrate
when you're hungry.

923
00:51:40,399 --> 00:51:42,359
Oh, I don't know.
I really shouldn't.

924
00:51:42,401 --> 00:51:45,320
- I have so many things to do.
- Oh, come on. I'll help you.

925
00:51:45,362 --> 00:51:47,364
I'll take out the garbage.
I'll do the dishes.

926
00:51:47,406 --> 00:51:49,241
I'll do your nails.
I'll do your hair.

927
00:51:49,283 --> 00:51:50,993
You have no idea
what I want to do.

928
00:51:51,034 --> 00:51:52,995
- I'll call him.
- I'll dial it!

929
00:51:53,036 --> 00:51:55,706
I'll just get the light.

930
00:51:55,747 --> 00:51:58,667
I think I'm attracted
to teachers.

931
00:51:58,709 --> 00:52:01,211
I took out an English teacher.
That didn't work out at all.

932
00:52:01,253 --> 00:52:03,839
I sent her a love letter.
She corrected it.

933
00:52:06,258 --> 00:52:08,427
Oh, great. Company.

934
00:52:12,639 --> 00:52:15,767
- Those two ought to get a room.
- Really.

935
00:52:15,809 --> 00:52:17,269
Actually,
I was married twice.

936
00:52:17,311 --> 00:52:20,981
My first wife, Jason's mother,
I really loved her.

937
00:52:21,023 --> 00:52:23,358
We had a good thing going,
you know?

938
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,610
She passed away
about ten years ago.

939
00:52:25,652 --> 00:52:28,280
After that, I screwed around
for a few years.

940
00:52:28,322 --> 00:52:31,617
Then I really went nuts...
I married Vanessa.

941
00:52:31,658 --> 00:52:33,660
I was just lonely, I guess.

942
00:52:33,702 --> 00:52:34,995
Is that over now?

943
00:52:35,037 --> 00:52:36,705
We were doomed from the start.

944
00:52:36,747 --> 00:52:38,665
I'm an earth sign,
she's a water sign.

945
00:52:38,707 --> 00:52:39,916
Together, we made mud.

946
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,503
I picked a beauty.
And she played around, too.

947
00:52:43,545 --> 00:52:46,214
When she said, "I do,"
I should have said, "With who?"

948
00:52:46,256 --> 00:52:48,634
So, are you
giving up on women?

949
00:52:48,675 --> 00:52:51,011
I don't know.
I can't figure women out.

950
00:52:51,053 --> 00:52:52,304
Today, they're independent.

951
00:52:52,346 --> 00:52:54,229
They only think
about themselves.

952
00:52:54,264 --> 00:52:57,476
During sex, Vanessa used
to scream out her own name.

953
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:01,021
I think it's the men
who are different.

954
00:53:01,063 --> 00:53:02,314
Ever since
the women's movement...

955
00:53:02,397 --> 00:53:03,940
most of the men I meet
go out of their way...

956
00:53:03,982 --> 00:53:05,699
to show you
how sensitive they are.

957
00:53:05,734 --> 00:53:09,780
Before they were too macho,
and now they're too soft.

958
00:53:09,821 --> 00:53:11,782
You all want us to know
you can cry.

959
00:53:11,823 --> 00:53:14,868
No, with women,
I never cry. Never.

960
00:53:14,910 --> 00:53:16,328
I beg.

961
00:53:20,290 --> 00:53:22,209
If we finish
this bottle of wine...

962
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:24,503
you won't have to beg.

963
00:53:41,561 --> 00:53:42,688
Diane!

964
00:53:44,606 --> 00:53:46,066
Oh, Philip.

965
00:53:46,108 --> 00:53:48,068
We were supposed
to go to dinner.

966
00:53:48,110 --> 00:53:49,861
I just had dinner!

967
00:53:49,903 --> 00:53:51,405
I don't believe this.

968
00:53:51,446 --> 00:53:55,617
Maybe it's a dream.
Good night, Philip.

969
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:58,453
You do a good job.

970
00:53:58,495 --> 00:54:01,456
What do you charge
for big cars?

971
00:54:12,301 --> 00:54:15,554
I had a lot of fun, Thornton.

972
00:54:15,595 --> 00:54:18,724
Me, too.
And thanks for the lesson.

973
00:54:18,807 --> 00:54:20,267
I learned a lot.

974
00:54:20,309 --> 00:54:22,936
You're welcome. I did, too.

975
00:54:24,813 --> 00:54:26,064
Well...

976
00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:30,652
Well, I guess
this is good night.

977
00:54:30,694 --> 00:54:32,070
Yeah.

978
00:54:34,072 --> 00:54:36,199
A very good night.

979
00:54:42,956 --> 00:54:44,333
Beautiful.

980
00:54:46,168 --> 00:54:47,502
Oh, that's it.

981
00:54:47,544 --> 00:54:49,880
That's the spot.
Just keep doing that.

982
00:54:49,921 --> 00:54:52,883
Oh, don't lose it.

983
00:54:52,924 --> 00:54:55,093
Oh, Lou, you're great.

984
00:54:55,135 --> 00:54:58,055
The leg is better.
You got the cramp out.

985
00:54:58,096 --> 00:55:01,433
You're a wreck.
You gotta start working out.

986
00:55:01,516 --> 00:55:03,268
And you know what else?

987
00:55:03,310 --> 00:55:06,188
You have got midterms
coming up.

988
00:55:06,229 --> 00:55:08,857
You haven't studied five minutes
since you got here.

989
00:55:08,899 --> 00:55:10,067
You're always so neat.

990
00:55:10,108 --> 00:55:11,985
You're just like
your Uncle Vito.

991
00:55:12,027 --> 00:55:14,613
We were kids,
his room was always in order.

992
00:55:14,655 --> 00:55:15,864
His towels lined up neatly...

993
00:55:15,906 --> 00:55:18,075
combs, brushes, hair lotions
all in the right place.

994
00:55:18,116 --> 00:55:20,077
What did it mean?
What is he today?

995
00:55:20,118 --> 00:55:21,620
He's an attendant
in the men's room.

996
00:55:21,662 --> 00:55:24,122
Hey, he's my idol.

997
00:55:24,164 --> 00:55:29,378
But I'm not gonna be
folding towels anymore...

998
00:55:29,419 --> 00:55:32,547
'cause I just made...
ta da... the diving team.

999
00:55:32,589 --> 00:55:35,217
That's great!

1000
00:55:35,258 --> 00:55:36,426
I'm takin' you out.

1001
00:55:36,468 --> 00:55:38,095
We'll celebrate.
We're havin' a party!

1002
00:55:38,136 --> 00:55:40,806
Oh, no, Dad, that's really nice,
but I'm in training now.

1003
00:55:40,847 --> 00:55:43,308
We got a big meet coming up
against Northern.

1004
00:55:43,350 --> 00:55:45,394
We'll have a party
after the meet.

1005
00:55:45,435 --> 00:55:49,398
Dad, why don't you join me
on a little reality break, OK?

1006
00:55:49,439 --> 00:55:51,775
Just 'cause you're in love
with Dr. Turner...

1007
00:55:51,817 --> 00:55:54,611
does not mean you're
gonna pass her course.

1008
00:55:54,653 --> 00:55:57,197
You got a major paper
coming up on Kurt Vonnegut.

1009
00:55:57,239 --> 00:55:59,032
You haven't even read
any of the books.

1010
00:55:59,074 --> 00:56:00,784
I tried.

1011
00:56:00,826 --> 00:56:03,996
I don't understand
a word of it.

1012
00:56:04,997 --> 00:56:08,000
So, how you gonna
write the paper, then?

1013
00:56:12,004 --> 00:56:15,215
Hi, I'm Kurt Vonnegut.
I'm looking for Thornton Melon.

1014
00:56:17,926 --> 00:56:20,554
Want to come in? Dad?

1015
00:56:23,598 --> 00:56:26,393
I don't want to hear
one more word out of you...

1016
00:56:26,435 --> 00:56:28,395
or it's back to the tree.

1017
00:56:28,437 --> 00:56:30,772
Come in.

1018
00:56:30,814 --> 00:56:33,817
Excuse me. Dr. Barazini?

1019
00:56:33,859 --> 00:56:35,235
I'm Thornton Melon.

1020
00:56:35,277 --> 00:56:38,780
Oh, yes, Thornton Melon.
I know you.

1021
00:56:38,822 --> 00:56:42,451
You delivered the paper
on isomagnetic brain waves...

1022
00:56:42,492 --> 00:56:44,036
in Montreal last year.

1023
00:56:44,077 --> 00:56:46,663
No, I sold you your pants.

1024
00:56:46,705 --> 00:56:48,749
Oh, of course.
Good to see you.

1025
00:56:48,790 --> 00:56:50,292
What are you doing here?

1026
00:56:50,334 --> 00:56:52,753
I'm supposed to report here
for my lab project.

1027
00:56:52,794 --> 00:56:55,631
Oh, good. I'm trying to teach
these here apes...

1028
00:56:55,672 --> 00:56:57,424
how to read and write.

1029
00:56:57,466 --> 00:57:00,260
You ought to teach them
how to go to the bathroom.

1030
00:57:00,302 --> 00:57:02,352
You'll get used to that.

1031
00:57:02,387 --> 00:57:07,184
Now, all you have to do
is put a new tape...

1032
00:57:07,225 --> 00:57:10,812
in the tape machine every hour
and observe the animals.

1033
00:57:10,896 --> 00:57:13,065
I'll be back in a few hours
to check on you.

1034
00:57:13,106 --> 00:57:15,651
- OK, fine.
- All righty.

1035
00:57:17,486 --> 00:57:20,822
You don't need this.
I'll find you an organ grinder.

1036
00:57:30,791 --> 00:57:32,918
Hiya, Marge?
A few things.

1037
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:35,671
I need you and the gang to get
down here as fast as you can.

1038
00:57:35,712 --> 00:57:37,339
And I have to talk to Peterson,
the accountant.

1039
00:57:37,381 --> 00:57:38,757
I'm gonna need him, too.

1040
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:42,052
Oh, thanks.
And, Marge, I need...

1041
00:57:44,972 --> 00:57:47,224
See if you can get somebody
at the Rand Corporation...

1042
00:57:47,265 --> 00:57:50,185
or the Brookings Institute to
come down here for about a week.

1043
00:57:52,771 --> 00:57:53,981
What?

1044
00:57:55,816 --> 00:57:58,819
And Russell hits him
with a powerful front body slam!

1045
00:58:03,865 --> 00:58:05,117
No problem.

1046
00:58:05,158 --> 00:58:07,536
They're takin' a break,
that's all.

1047
00:58:09,079 --> 00:58:12,687
In 1971, the United States
accumulated deficits...

1048
00:58:12,722 --> 00:58:16,295
greater than the supply
of gold the country held.

1049
00:58:16,336 --> 00:58:18,964
In that year, Richard Nixon...

1050
00:58:19,006 --> 00:58:21,967
took the United States
off the gold standard.

1051
00:58:22,009 --> 00:58:24,386
In doing so, he disrupted...

1052
00:58:26,972 --> 00:58:29,975
the entire international
monetary system.

1053
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:32,728
What is that clicking noise?

1054
00:58:37,858 --> 00:58:39,901
Are you a student
in this class?

1055
00:58:41,737 --> 00:58:43,155
No.

1056
00:58:43,196 --> 00:58:45,699
Who are you?

1057
00:58:45,741 --> 00:58:48,994
I'm Marge Sweetwater...

1058
00:58:49,036 --> 00:58:51,371
Mr. Thornton Melon's
private secretary.

1059
00:58:58,378 --> 00:59:01,381
What are you doing here?

1060
00:59:01,423 --> 00:59:04,843
I'm taking notes for Mr. Melon.

1061
00:59:08,597 --> 00:59:12,768
He told you to write down
everything I say?

1062
00:59:12,809 --> 00:59:15,562
Yes, he did.

1063
00:59:15,604 --> 00:59:17,022
Good.

1064
00:59:19,483 --> 00:59:21,777
Take this down.

1065
00:59:24,529 --> 00:59:27,908
Mr. Melon,
no matter what you do...

1066
00:59:29,451 --> 00:59:32,329
no matter what stunts
you pull...

1067
00:59:32,412 --> 00:59:35,540
no matter how hard you try...

1068
00:59:35,582 --> 00:59:40,003
you will never, ever
pass this course.

1069
00:59:42,965 --> 00:59:45,425
Make sure he gets that.

1070
00:59:48,470 --> 00:59:50,430
Yes, sir.

1071
00:59:50,472 --> 00:59:51,640
I'll tell you what.

1072
00:59:51,723 --> 00:59:53,892
It's for Barbay.
Make it an "A."

1073
00:59:53,934 --> 00:59:56,103
Where's the lab report
on psychology?

1074
00:59:56,144 --> 00:59:57,479
Here.

1075
00:59:59,481 --> 01:00:02,651
It's too light.
It feels like a "C."

1076
01:00:02,693 --> 01:00:05,904
Bulk it up and add a few
multicolored graphs.

1077
01:00:05,988 --> 01:00:08,615
- Yo, Dad.
- Jason, hold it, will ya?

1078
01:00:08,657 --> 01:00:11,368
Listen, everybody.
Let's see "As" across the board.

1079
01:00:11,410 --> 01:00:12,577
I'll tell you what...

1080
01:00:12,619 --> 01:00:14,997
a ten percent bonus
for every grade over "B."

1081
01:00:15,038 --> 01:00:19,584
And an A+ gets you a free trip
to Hawaii... off-season.

1082
01:00:21,128 --> 01:00:24,965
- Dad, what's going on here?
- I'm doing my homework.

1083
01:00:25,007 --> 01:00:27,217
No, they're doing
your homework.

1084
01:00:27,259 --> 01:00:30,178
A good executive knows how
to delegate authority.

1085
01:00:30,220 --> 01:00:32,848
I took care of you, too.

1086
01:00:32,889 --> 01:00:36,601
- And what's this?
- Your astronomy report.

1087
01:00:36,643 --> 01:00:39,146
- What's wrong with you?
- What's wrong with you?

1088
01:00:39,187 --> 01:00:41,523
I want to write that paper.
I'm gonna write that paper.

1089
01:00:41,565 --> 01:00:44,109
That's why I'm taking astronomy,
to learn something!

1090
01:00:44,151 --> 01:00:46,111
You're never gonna learn
a goddamn thing...

1091
01:00:46,153 --> 01:00:48,155
if you got people
doing your work for you!

1092
01:00:48,196 --> 01:00:50,115
Oh, never mind.

1093
01:00:51,491 --> 01:00:56,121
Kids... they always do things
the hard way.

1094
01:00:56,163 --> 01:01:00,083
Ladies and gentlemen,
the visiting team...

1095
01:01:00,125 --> 01:01:03,378
the Northern University
Wildcats!

1096
01:01:04,838 --> 01:01:09,384
And your Grand Lakes
University Hooters!

1097
01:01:09,426 --> 01:01:12,220
- Hey, there's your boy!
- Jason!

1098
01:01:16,266 --> 01:01:19,394
While the teams are warming up,
we'd like to remind you...

1099
01:01:19,429 --> 01:01:21,480
that all proceeds
from the refreshment stands...

1100
01:01:21,521 --> 01:01:23,148
go to your student government.

1101
01:01:23,190 --> 01:01:25,734
Hey, Valerie. How you doin'?

1102
01:01:25,769 --> 01:01:28,278
Glad you could come. Listen.

1103
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:31,323
My dad is having a party
tonight at the dorm...

1104
01:01:31,365 --> 01:01:34,242
and it should be pretty great.
His parties usually are.

1105
01:01:34,284 --> 01:01:38,997
I'd love to come,
except for I have a date.

1106
01:01:39,039 --> 01:01:42,501
Oh. Well, hey, bring him along.

1107
01:01:42,542 --> 01:01:45,003
It's OK.
You just both come by.

1108
01:01:45,045 --> 01:01:46,964
I'll really try.

1109
01:01:47,005 --> 01:01:48,966
Good. I hope
I'll see you there.

1110
01:01:49,007 --> 01:01:52,094
It sounds like fun. I wish
my dad were more like yours.

1111
01:02:02,729 --> 01:02:05,357
Hey, Chas.

1112
01:02:05,399 --> 01:02:07,192
Good luck, buddy.
Let's get them.

1113
01:02:07,234 --> 01:02:10,821
Yeah. Thanks, Melon.
I'd wish you luck, too...

1114
01:02:10,862 --> 01:02:12,864
but I guess a guy like you
doesn't need luck.

1115
01:02:13,907 --> 01:02:15,867
What's that supposed to mean?

1116
01:02:15,909 --> 01:02:17,995
With your old man behind you...

1117
01:02:18,036 --> 01:02:20,539
I figured since he bought
your way onto the team...

1118
01:02:20,580 --> 01:02:23,083
he probably bought off
the judges, too.

1119
01:02:27,129 --> 01:02:29,798
Oh, there's Thornton.

1120
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:31,925
Diane!

1121
01:02:33,510 --> 01:02:37,014
I can't imagine what you can
possibly see in that man.

1122
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:40,267
Philip, would you excuse me
for a minute?

1123
01:02:44,146 --> 01:02:46,189
Yes, yes.

1124
01:02:46,231 --> 01:02:48,233
- You look great.
- Oh, thanks.

1125
01:02:48,275 --> 01:02:50,068
Where you been?
I called you a hundred times.

1126
01:02:50,110 --> 01:02:52,070
I made four dates
with your answering machine.

1127
01:02:52,112 --> 01:02:54,072
I'm sorry I missed you.
Things have been so hectic.

1128
01:02:54,114 --> 01:02:56,908
I've been reading midterm papers
and grading exams.

1129
01:02:56,950 --> 01:02:58,243
Did you read mine yet?

1130
01:02:58,285 --> 01:03:00,078
Not yet,
but I'm looking forward to it.

1131
01:03:00,162 --> 01:03:02,039
I'm throwing a party
in our room tonight...

1132
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:03,582
and you better be there.

1133
01:03:03,624 --> 01:03:06,585
I'm sorry. I have a date
with Philip tonight.

1134
01:03:06,627 --> 01:03:10,339
Bring him along.
We may run out of ice.

1135
01:03:13,008 --> 01:03:17,095
First diver
for Grand Lakes University...

1136
01:03:17,137 --> 01:03:19,431
Chas Osbourne.

1137
01:03:42,579 --> 01:03:46,208
Hey, Coach! How are ya?
How you doin', huh?

1138
01:03:50,837 --> 01:03:56,134
Next diver for Grand Lakes...
Jason Melon.

1139
01:03:56,176 --> 01:03:58,470
Melon.

1140
01:04:43,682 --> 01:04:44,766
What's going on?

1141
01:04:44,808 --> 01:04:47,018
This is always
the best party of the year.

1142
01:04:47,053 --> 01:04:49,229
I don't know.
Some big event at the dorms.

1143
01:04:49,271 --> 01:04:52,816
- We're thinkin' of going over.
- To Melon's? Are you nuts?

1144
01:04:52,858 --> 01:04:54,359
Why don't we go?

1145
01:04:54,401 --> 01:04:56,236
Valerie, please.
It'll be horrible.

1146
01:04:56,278 --> 01:04:58,870
Jason said it would be great.
It might be fun.

1147
01:04:58,905 --> 01:05:02,200
Jason's a twerp. We could have
won if it weren't for him.

1148
01:05:02,242 --> 01:05:04,953
Haven't you ever messed up?

1149
01:05:04,995 --> 01:05:06,204
No.

1150
01:05:11,209 --> 01:05:15,839
I'm all dressed up
with nowhere to go

1151
01:05:15,881 --> 01:05:17,633
Hey, baby!

1152
01:05:17,674 --> 01:05:20,886
Walking with a dead man
over my shoulder

1153
01:05:23,639 --> 01:05:26,433
I'm all dressed up
with nowhere to go

1154
01:05:28,810 --> 01:05:31,104
I love three girls at once.

1155
01:05:31,146 --> 01:05:34,191
If I fall asleep,
they have each other to talk to.

1156
01:05:41,782 --> 01:05:44,117
Nice look.
What are you going for?

1157
01:05:44,159 --> 01:05:46,536
The heavy, disassociated
artist thing...

1158
01:05:46,578 --> 01:05:50,332
or the "I'm going blind" thing?

1159
01:05:50,374 --> 01:05:54,294
Oh, It's the deaf thing.
Maybe this will cheer you up.

1160
01:05:54,336 --> 01:05:56,755
Oh, do me!

1161
01:05:56,797 --> 01:05:58,423
Derek! Get up, will ya?

1162
01:05:58,465 --> 01:06:01,635
You look like the poster boy
for birth control.

1163
01:06:05,347 --> 01:06:07,808
Jason, it's a party.
What's your story?

1164
01:06:07,849 --> 01:06:10,852
What's the matter?
The swim meet?

1165
01:06:10,887 --> 01:06:13,855
Forget about it. It's history.

1166
01:06:13,897 --> 01:06:16,233
Come on, will ya? Snap into it!

1167
01:06:16,275 --> 01:06:18,610
You're right, Dad.
It doesn't matter, Dad!

1168
01:06:18,694 --> 01:06:20,779
Right, Dad?
Come on, party, right?

1169
01:06:28,203 --> 01:06:30,414
Hey, buddy!

1170
01:06:30,455 --> 01:06:32,749
Everybody, make some noise,
have some fun!

1171
01:06:39,172 --> 01:06:40,966
What's that noise?

1172
01:06:41,008 --> 01:06:43,051
It's a party, Philip.
Midterms, remember?

1173
01:06:43,135 --> 01:06:45,595
They're just blowing off steam.

1174
01:06:45,637 --> 01:06:46,847
You there.

1175
01:06:49,266 --> 01:06:50,517
What's going on here?

1176
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:54,771
The Melon man is throwing
the greatest party of all time!

1177
01:06:54,813 --> 01:06:57,899
The whole world is there.
It's the best thing...

1178
01:06:57,941 --> 01:07:00,235
that's ever happened to me
in my whole life!

1179
01:07:00,277 --> 01:07:02,613
Oh, God.

1180
01:07:06,992 --> 01:07:08,994
Look at that!

1181
01:07:09,036 --> 01:07:10,203
Listen to that racket.

1182
01:07:10,245 --> 01:07:12,497
This is disgraceful.
I should phone security.

1183
01:07:12,539 --> 01:07:14,207
Oh, Philip.

1184
01:07:19,129 --> 01:07:22,341
Good. Apparently I'm not
the only one around here...

1185
01:07:22,382 --> 01:07:23,925
with a sense of decency.

1186
01:07:30,223 --> 01:07:32,059
Yeah. Cool!

1187
01:07:35,854 --> 01:07:38,315
Did you see...
where are you going?

1188
01:07:38,357 --> 01:07:40,317
Intellectual curiosity, Philip.

1189
01:07:40,359 --> 01:07:41,693
Sounds fun in there.
Come with me.

1190
01:07:41,735 --> 01:07:44,655
- Oh, please!
- Oh, Philip!

1191
01:07:48,533 --> 01:07:51,036
It's a dead man's party

1192
01:07:51,078 --> 01:07:53,205
Who could ask for more

1193
01:07:54,289 --> 01:07:56,208
Everybody's coming

1194
01:07:56,249 --> 01:07:59,211
Leave your body
at the door

1195
01:07:59,252 --> 01:08:03,048
Leave your body and soul
at the door

1196
01:08:04,049 --> 01:08:06,551
Don't run away

1197
01:08:06,635 --> 01:08:09,388
It's only me

1198
01:08:16,269 --> 01:08:18,438
Don't run away

1199
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:21,775
It's only me, only me

1200
01:08:21,817 --> 01:08:25,112
Don't be afraid

1201
01:08:25,153 --> 01:08:29,574
Of what you can't see

1202
01:08:29,616 --> 01:08:31,785
Say when.

1203
01:08:31,827 --> 01:08:34,454
Right after this drink.

1204
01:08:34,496 --> 01:08:37,019
Hey, what's a bath
without Bubbles?

1205
01:08:37,054 --> 01:08:39,543
Hey, Bubbles,
come over here, will ya?

1206
01:08:41,837 --> 01:08:44,423
Well!

1207
01:08:44,464 --> 01:08:46,717
- Hi there.
- Hi!

1208
01:08:46,758 --> 01:08:48,927
- What's your favorite subject?
- Poetry.

1209
01:08:48,969 --> 01:08:52,931
Really? Maybe you can help me
straighten out my Longfellow.

1210
01:08:56,685 --> 01:08:58,770
Excuse me.
Have you seen Thornton Melon?

1211
01:08:58,812 --> 01:09:00,606
I think he's in there.

1212
01:09:00,647 --> 01:09:01,815
Thanks.

1213
01:09:08,238 --> 01:09:11,158
Excuse me.
Has anyone seen Thornton Melon?

1214
01:09:12,326 --> 01:09:14,911
That's what I call
marine biology.

1215
01:09:14,953 --> 01:09:16,371
Diane!

1216
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:20,167
Say hello to my nieces.

1217
01:09:21,710 --> 01:09:23,170
Wait a minute!

1218
01:09:27,841 --> 01:09:32,262
Jason? There you are.
I was looking all over for you.

1219
01:09:32,304 --> 01:09:36,350
Jason, are you OK?
I'm sorry about the swim meet.

1220
01:09:36,391 --> 01:09:39,603
Shit. Swim meet.

1221
01:09:39,645 --> 01:09:42,397
Jesus, you think I care
about the swim meet?

1222
01:09:42,439 --> 01:09:44,274
I mean, it's just
a stupid college game.

1223
01:09:44,316 --> 01:09:45,657
It's just bullshit.

1224
01:09:45,692 --> 01:09:47,653
Why are you acting like this?

1225
01:09:47,694 --> 01:09:49,696
I know you don't think
like that.

1226
01:09:49,738 --> 01:09:52,032
Oh, you do?

1227
01:09:52,074 --> 01:09:55,160
Grow up, Valerie.
You think this is real?

1228
01:09:55,202 --> 01:09:58,288
This isn't real.
College is a dream world.

1229
01:09:58,330 --> 01:10:00,082
This is something you do
to pass the time...

1230
01:10:00,123 --> 01:10:02,584
till you go out in the real
world and start buying people.

1231
01:10:02,626 --> 01:10:05,337
Let's go for a walk
and talk this out.

1232
01:10:05,379 --> 01:10:07,464
There you are.

1233
01:10:07,506 --> 01:10:09,508
Can we go? I'm bored.

1234
01:10:09,549 --> 01:10:10,717
Oh, Christ, Osbourne...

1235
01:10:10,759 --> 01:10:13,011
will you just get
your ass outta here?

1236
01:10:13,053 --> 01:10:15,055
What a surprise.
Another shit-faced Melon.

1237
01:10:15,097 --> 01:10:17,265
Do I gotta knock your teeth
down your throat?

1238
01:10:17,307 --> 01:10:20,227
Easy. Your father isn't here
to back you up this time.

1239
01:10:22,229 --> 01:10:23,689
Don't!

1240
01:10:28,068 --> 01:10:29,403
Are you OK?

1241
01:10:29,444 --> 01:10:33,073
Jason! I was lookin' for ya.

1242
01:10:33,115 --> 01:10:36,076
Hey, come here. Where ya goin'?

1243
01:10:36,118 --> 01:10:38,620
Where am I going?

1244
01:10:38,662 --> 01:10:41,331
I'm leaving school, Dad.
One of us has gotta go.

1245
01:10:41,415 --> 01:10:43,583
You're having such a great time.
I'm getting out.

1246
01:10:43,625 --> 01:10:45,085
Why? I don't get it.

1247
01:10:45,127 --> 01:10:46,795
Because you didn't win
the diving meet?

1248
01:10:46,837 --> 01:10:48,588
No, not because I didn't win!

1249
01:10:48,630 --> 01:10:50,299
Because I shouldn't
even have been there.

1250
01:10:50,340 --> 01:10:51,883
Chas told me
you bribed the coach...

1251
01:10:51,925 --> 01:10:53,385
to put me on the team.
Real good!

1252
01:10:53,427 --> 01:10:56,596
What? And you believed him.
I never lied to you in my life.

1253
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:57,931
I didn't bribe the coach.

1254
01:10:57,973 --> 01:10:59,725
You were on the team
because you deserve it.

1255
01:10:59,766 --> 01:11:01,476
You made it on your own.

1256
01:11:01,518 --> 01:11:03,312
Dad, you don't get it.

1257
01:11:03,353 --> 01:11:04,938
Everything I have
is because of you...

1258
01:11:04,973 --> 01:11:06,106
and because of you...

1259
01:11:06,148 --> 01:11:09,901
I get my astronomy homework
done for me by NASA.

1260
01:11:09,943 --> 01:11:12,946
I just want the best for you.
That's all I ever wanted.

1261
01:11:15,490 --> 01:11:17,200
I did it all for you.

1262
01:11:18,619 --> 01:11:21,204
I know, but you don't know
when to quit.

1263
01:11:21,246 --> 01:11:25,083
I know you came here to help me,
and I really appreciate it...

1264
01:11:25,167 --> 01:11:27,919
and it's really sweet,
and it's really not working.

1265
01:11:27,961 --> 01:11:29,796
Can't you let me just do
something for myself?

1266
01:11:29,838 --> 01:11:31,923
I just want to see you happy.

1267
01:11:31,965 --> 01:11:34,593
Well, take a good look!

1268
01:11:34,635 --> 01:11:38,263
'Cause I was a lot happier
when I was miserable.

1269
01:11:49,900 --> 01:11:51,693
I enjoyed reading that, Susan.

1270
01:11:51,735 --> 01:11:52,986
It's a nice improvement.
Thank you.

1271
01:11:53,028 --> 01:11:55,572
Diane, why'd you fail me?

1272
01:11:55,614 --> 01:11:58,116
I didn't, Thornton.
You failed me.

1273
01:11:58,158 --> 01:12:01,620
- Is it because of last night?
- No. I can accept the fact...

1274
01:12:01,662 --> 01:12:03,622
that you're completely
regressed emotionally...

1275
01:12:03,664 --> 01:12:06,625
but you won't pass my course by
turning in someone else's work.

1276
01:12:06,667 --> 01:12:09,419
What do you think,
someone else wrote this?

1277
01:12:09,461 --> 01:12:11,838
All I know is that you didn't.
That's what disappoints me.

1278
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:13,924
Whoever did write it...

1279
01:12:13,966 --> 01:12:16,635
doesn't know the first thing
about Kurt Vonnegut.

1280
01:12:16,677 --> 01:12:17,886
And another thing, Vonnegut.

1281
01:12:17,928 --> 01:12:20,347
I'm going to stop payment
on the check.

1282
01:12:20,389 --> 01:12:22,849
What's that? Fuck me?

1283
01:12:22,891 --> 01:12:26,520
Kurt, do you read lips?
Fuck you!

1284
01:12:26,561 --> 01:12:28,563
Next time
I'll call Robert Ludlum.

1285
01:12:32,526 --> 01:12:34,528
Derek, have you seen Jason?

1286
01:12:34,569 --> 01:12:37,531
I think he's on
a three-state killing spree.

1287
01:12:37,572 --> 01:12:39,324
Here's some more
potentially bad news.

1288
01:12:39,366 --> 01:12:42,202
Dean Martin wants to see you
in his office right away.

1289
01:12:42,244 --> 01:12:43,620
Dean Martin.

1290
01:12:45,580 --> 01:12:50,085
And she said, "Let's do it.
The room's already paid for. "

1291
01:12:54,256 --> 01:12:57,801
Oh, golly.
I'm afraid we have...

1292
01:12:57,884 --> 01:13:01,722
a potentially unpleasant
situation on our hands here.

1293
01:13:01,763 --> 01:13:04,891
Phil, would you repeat
to Mr. Melon...

1294
01:13:04,933 --> 01:13:08,061
the allegations
that you've made to me?

1295
01:13:08,103 --> 01:13:11,106
It's clear the work you've
handed in is not your own.

1296
01:13:11,141 --> 01:13:13,525
I'm accusing you
of academic fraud.

1297
01:13:13,567 --> 01:13:17,321
Fraud is such an ugly word...

1298
01:13:17,362 --> 01:13:20,282
considering
the financial generosity...

1299
01:13:20,324 --> 01:13:23,327
that Mr. Melon has shown
towards our fine university.

1300
01:13:23,368 --> 01:13:26,038
I think Mr. Melon
should be expelled.

1301
01:13:27,706 --> 01:13:30,876
What are you going
to do about it?

1302
01:13:32,294 --> 01:13:34,421
Well, Thornton...

1303
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:37,132
I'm only going
to ask you this one time.

1304
01:13:37,174 --> 01:13:40,719
Is the work that
you turned in your own?

1305
01:13:44,473 --> 01:13:47,059
I can't lie to you,
Dean Martin.

1306
01:13:49,603 --> 01:13:51,104
Yes, it is.

1307
01:13:51,146 --> 01:13:53,732
I'm satisfied.

1308
01:13:53,774 --> 01:13:55,943
- Phil?
- I'm outraged.

1309
01:13:55,984 --> 01:13:59,071
Gee whiz, Phil!
I just asked the man...

1310
01:13:59,112 --> 01:14:01,239
if the work was his,
and he said yes.

1311
01:14:01,281 --> 01:14:03,909
What do you want me to do,
torture him?

1312
01:14:05,327 --> 01:14:08,664
I suggest a comprehensive
oral examination...

1313
01:14:08,705 --> 01:14:11,166
conducted by all of
Mr. Melon's professors.

1314
01:14:11,208 --> 01:14:12,591
Oral examination?

1315
01:14:12,626 --> 01:14:16,171
Yes. If you've done the work
you say you have...

1316
01:14:16,254 --> 01:14:19,549
there should be no problem,
should there?

1317
01:14:21,426 --> 01:14:23,762
Hey, Jase.

1318
01:14:23,804 --> 01:14:26,306
Hey, Lou. How you doin'?

1319
01:14:26,348 --> 01:14:28,225
Come here.
I want to tell you something.

1320
01:14:28,266 --> 01:14:29,393
What?

1321
01:14:29,434 --> 01:14:31,687
You were pretty hard
on your father last night.

1322
01:14:31,728 --> 01:14:34,106
I know, but the guy
doesn't understand.

1323
01:14:34,147 --> 01:14:36,858
I know your pop thirty years.
He understands.

1324
01:14:36,900 --> 01:14:39,278
He's a nice guy,
and he's tough.

1325
01:14:39,319 --> 01:14:43,365
Like me.
I'm nice, and I'm tough.

1326
01:14:43,407 --> 01:14:45,958
I'll give you an idea
what I mean.

1327
01:14:45,993 --> 01:14:48,620
My two boys... I put one
through college...

1328
01:14:48,662 --> 01:14:50,497
and the other
I put through a wall.

1329
01:14:51,999 --> 01:14:54,001
Your papa loves you.

1330
01:14:55,252 --> 01:14:58,797
He's lookin' out for ya.
Look out for him.

1331
01:15:24,323 --> 01:15:25,616
What's goin' on?

1332
01:15:25,657 --> 01:15:28,410
I'm leavin'. I'm sorry, Jason.

1333
01:15:28,452 --> 01:15:31,496
This college thing
was a big mistake.

1334
01:15:31,538 --> 01:15:34,541
- So you're gonna give up?
- I can't win.

1335
01:15:34,583 --> 01:15:37,210
They want me to take oral exams
in all my subjects.

1336
01:15:37,252 --> 01:15:39,755
If I don't take them,
they'll kick me out.

1337
01:15:39,796 --> 01:15:42,341
And if I take 'em,
who knows where they'll kick me.

1338
01:15:45,135 --> 01:15:47,512
Hey, Dad, you remember
what you told me...

1339
01:15:47,547 --> 01:15:49,640
when I told you
I wanted to quit?

1340
01:15:49,681 --> 01:15:53,060
You told me that a man
without an education is nothing.

1341
01:15:53,101 --> 01:15:54,186
I can't do it.

1342
01:15:54,227 --> 01:15:55,729
You can do anything
you want to do.

1343
01:15:55,771 --> 01:15:58,899
You can do anything
you want in life.

1344
01:15:58,941 --> 01:16:00,901
Remember, you're a Melon.

1345
01:16:04,905 --> 01:16:07,741
Don't quit. I'll help you.

1346
01:17:34,202 --> 01:17:36,455
Before we begin...

1347
01:17:36,496 --> 01:17:40,042
I would just like to thank
each and every professor here...

1348
01:17:40,083 --> 01:17:44,129
for taking time out of
his/her extremely busy schedule.

1349
01:17:44,171 --> 01:17:48,175
And a special thanks, of course,
to Mr. Thornton Melon...

1350
01:17:48,216 --> 01:17:51,303
who I don't have to remind
anyone is the donor...

1351
01:17:51,345 --> 01:17:54,222
of our new
Melon School of Business.

1352
01:18:02,564 --> 01:18:04,524
We're wasting time.

1353
01:18:04,566 --> 01:18:07,159
Sorry, Phil.

1354
01:18:07,194 --> 01:18:10,530
Now, Mr. Melon,
you'll have three hours...

1355
01:18:10,572 --> 01:18:12,532
to complete the examination.

1356
01:18:12,574 --> 01:18:17,371
If you fail any part of it,
you will be expelled.

1357
01:18:17,412 --> 01:18:20,082
Mr. Melon, do you understand?

1358
01:18:21,959 --> 01:18:24,252
- The Council of Trent.
- Excuse me?

1359
01:18:24,294 --> 01:18:25,879
I missed the question.

1360
01:18:25,921 --> 01:18:27,756
We haven't begun yet.

1361
01:18:29,925 --> 01:18:32,928
Well, Dr. Barbay,
I suppose you're up first.

1362
01:18:47,401 --> 01:18:51,863
I have only one question
for Mr. Melon...

1363
01:18:56,285 --> 01:18:59,454
in 27 parts.

1364
01:19:02,124 --> 01:19:04,876
I'd like to break him
in 27 parts.

1365
01:19:04,918 --> 01:19:06,253
Excuse me?

1366
01:19:06,295 --> 01:19:07,713
No, nothin', nothin'.

1367
01:19:10,757 --> 01:19:14,094
Discuss the foundations of
modern global business systems.

1368
01:19:14,136 --> 01:19:16,930
Part one: Define
and differentiate...

1369
01:19:16,972 --> 01:19:18,932
the three economic
philosophies...

1370
01:19:18,974 --> 01:19:21,143
of capitalism, socialism
and communism...

1371
01:19:21,184 --> 01:19:24,688
as pertains to:
A... management fundamentals;

1372
01:19:24,730 --> 01:19:26,940
B... organizing and staffing;

1373
01:19:26,982 --> 01:19:28,900
C... labor management;

1374
01:19:28,942 --> 01:19:31,653
and D... production
and operations.

1375
01:19:31,695 --> 01:19:34,740
Part two...

1376
01:19:34,781 --> 01:19:37,784
Are you getting
all this, Mr. Melon?

1377
01:19:37,826 --> 01:19:40,579
Yeah. It's a piece o' cake.

1378
01:19:43,206 --> 01:19:45,626
Jason?

1379
01:19:50,631 --> 01:19:52,591
Valerie.

1380
01:19:52,633 --> 01:19:57,220
I wanted to apologize
for the other night...

1381
01:19:57,262 --> 01:20:01,683
my behavior
and the things I said.

1382
01:20:01,725 --> 01:20:03,268
And to thank you...

1383
01:20:03,310 --> 01:20:06,563
for your behavior
and the things you said.

1384
01:20:07,689 --> 01:20:11,199
I'm really sorry.

1385
01:20:11,234 --> 01:20:13,278
And I'm really
in love with you...

1386
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:15,072
and I really have been
for a very long time.

1387
01:20:15,113 --> 01:20:18,241
And I can't believe
I'm saying this.

1388
01:20:18,283 --> 01:20:21,161
I don't want
to embarrass you...

1389
01:20:21,203 --> 01:20:24,539
or make you feel
uncomfortable with me...

1390
01:20:24,581 --> 01:20:27,125
but...

1391
01:20:27,167 --> 01:20:32,839
I've been needing to tell you
this for a very long time.

1392
01:20:35,634 --> 01:20:37,844
Are you aware that
that's the most...

1393
01:20:37,886 --> 01:20:40,472
you've ever said to me
at one time?

1394
01:20:40,514 --> 01:20:43,850
Except, of course, for the time
that you were ravingly drunk.

1395
01:20:45,602 --> 01:20:47,062
I love you, too.

1396
01:21:09,209 --> 01:21:12,921
In response
to Roman numeral 27...

1397
01:21:12,963 --> 01:21:15,931
section three, part two...

1398
01:21:15,966 --> 01:21:19,720
of subset D...
of the question...

1399
01:21:19,761 --> 01:21:22,180
the answer is...

1400
01:21:23,265 --> 01:21:24,850
Mr. Melon?

1401
01:21:32,608 --> 01:21:33,817
Mr. Melon?

1402
01:21:33,859 --> 01:21:37,738
Hey, relax. This man's been put
under a lot of pressure.

1403
01:21:37,779 --> 01:21:39,698
Let's take it easy on him.

1404
01:21:39,740 --> 01:21:41,867
Say it! Say it!

1405
01:21:43,368 --> 01:21:46,371
The answer is... four?

1406
01:21:53,587 --> 01:21:54,546
Right.

1407
01:22:01,637 --> 01:22:03,805
Dr. Turner?

1408
01:22:08,644 --> 01:22:11,146
Hold it. That's it.

1409
01:22:11,188 --> 01:22:12,731
I can't take it no more.

1410
01:22:12,814 --> 01:22:17,444
I feel like I just gave birth
to an accountant.

1411
01:22:18,779 --> 01:22:20,280
Wait a minute, Thornton.

1412
01:22:32,167 --> 01:22:36,004
Thornton, do you remember
when we discussed...

1413
01:22:36,046 --> 01:22:37,589
the Dylan Thomas poem...

1414
01:22:37,631 --> 01:22:40,175
"Do Not Go Gentle
Into That Good Night"?

1415
01:22:40,217 --> 01:22:42,260
I don't know.

1416
01:22:42,344 --> 01:22:44,680
No. Maybe.

1417
01:22:44,721 --> 01:22:46,640
Thornton, think.

1418
01:22:46,682 --> 01:22:48,517
What's going on here?

1419
01:22:49,893 --> 01:22:53,355
Philip, relax. It's my turn.

1420
01:22:57,818 --> 01:22:59,194
Do you remember it?

1421
01:23:00,862 --> 01:23:04,032
"Do not go gentle into...

1422
01:23:04,074 --> 01:23:06,576
"into that good night.

1423
01:23:08,745 --> 01:23:11,498
"Old age should burn
and rage...

1424
01:23:11,540 --> 01:23:15,627
"at close of day.

1425
01:23:15,669 --> 01:23:19,006
"Rage, rage against
the dying of the light.

1426
01:23:19,047 --> 01:23:21,466
"Wild men who caught...

1427
01:23:21,508 --> 01:23:24,553
"and sang the sun in flight
and learned too late...

1428
01:23:24,594 --> 01:23:27,312
"they grieved it on its way.

1429
01:23:27,347 --> 01:23:30,892
"Do not go gentle
into that good night.

1430
01:23:30,934 --> 01:23:33,604
"Grave men near death...

1431
01:23:33,645 --> 01:23:36,106
"who see with blinding sight.

1432
01:23:36,148 --> 01:23:39,568
"Blind eyes could blaze
like meteors and be gay.

1433
01:23:39,610 --> 01:23:43,822
"Rage, rage against
the dying of the light.

1434
01:23:43,864 --> 01:23:48,577
"And you, my father,
there on the sad height.

1435
01:23:48,619 --> 01:23:50,621
"Curse, bless me now...

1436
01:23:50,662 --> 01:23:52,581
"with your fierce tears,
I pray.

1437
01:23:52,623 --> 01:23:56,001
"Do not go gentle
into that good night.

1438
01:23:56,043 --> 01:24:00,088
"Rage! Rage against
the dying of the light!"

1439
01:24:00,130 --> 01:24:02,924
Thornton, what does that poem
mean to you?

1440
01:24:02,966 --> 01:24:05,052
It means...

1441
01:24:05,093 --> 01:24:07,387
I don't take shit from no one.

1442
01:24:08,847 --> 01:24:10,849
I'm gonna pass this test.

1443
01:24:10,933 --> 01:24:14,436
I'm stayin' in school!
Who's next?

1444
01:24:17,481 --> 01:24:20,525
Now diving for
the Atlantic Eastern Eagles...

1445
01:24:20,567 --> 01:24:24,571
current conference champion...
Doug Nelson.

1446
01:24:24,613 --> 01:24:27,115
You know what you
almost never see?

1447
01:24:27,199 --> 01:24:30,327
Somebody heckling a diver.

1448
01:24:42,923 --> 01:24:45,926
- You're all right, kid.
- Thanks, Lou.

1449
01:24:45,968 --> 01:24:50,681
Please refrain from making
loud noises during the dives.

1450
01:24:52,849 --> 01:24:56,770
Next up, the Atlantic
Eastern Eagles'...

1451
01:24:56,812 --> 01:24:58,814
Bill Steincap.

1452
01:25:17,291 --> 01:25:21,253
That concludes Atlantic
Eastern's ten-meter dives.

1453
01:25:21,295 --> 01:25:24,089
Next up,
the Grand Lakes Hooters.

1454
01:25:27,050 --> 01:25:28,677
We would like to remind you...

1455
01:25:28,719 --> 01:25:30,971
tickets to all Grand Lakes
sporting events...

1456
01:25:31,013 --> 01:25:34,099
are available through
the student services office.

1457
01:25:34,141 --> 01:25:36,226
Are you interested
in Valerie Desmond?

1458
01:25:36,268 --> 01:25:38,854
She's with me.

1459
01:25:38,895 --> 01:25:41,648
Coming into your own,
are you, Melon?

1460
01:25:41,690 --> 01:25:43,108
I wouldn't break my arm...

1461
01:25:43,150 --> 01:25:45,402
patting myself on the back
if I were you.

1462
01:25:45,444 --> 01:25:47,446
Because... get this, towel boy...

1463
01:25:47,487 --> 01:25:50,616
no matter what you think,
you will always be a crude...

1464
01:25:50,699 --> 01:25:53,292
obnoxious, nouveau riche
little phlebe...

1465
01:25:53,327 --> 01:25:56,455
and you're gonna end up
just like your father.

1466
01:25:56,496 --> 01:25:59,625
God, I hope so,
'cause I happen to love the guy.

1467
01:25:59,660 --> 01:26:03,003
First up for
Grand Lakes University...

1468
01:26:03,045 --> 01:26:05,130
Chas Osbourne...

1469
01:26:05,172 --> 01:26:07,883
former national
high school champion.

1470
01:26:35,202 --> 01:26:38,205
- Jason dive yet?
- Not yet. Did you pass?

1471
01:26:38,246 --> 01:26:39,748
I don't know.
They'll let me know.

1472
01:26:39,790 --> 01:26:42,501
Now diving
for Grand Lakes University...

1473
01:26:42,542 --> 01:26:44,878
Jason Melon.

1474
01:27:04,564 --> 01:27:06,608
Attaboy, Jason! You did it!

1475
01:27:11,989 --> 01:27:13,031
All right!

1476
01:27:17,828 --> 01:27:20,330
I can't believe it.
We could actually win this.

1477
01:27:20,372 --> 01:27:24,293
Melon's dive has put the Hooters
back in this meet.

1478
01:27:25,794 --> 01:27:27,212
What's the matter?

1479
01:27:28,755 --> 01:27:30,757
You're up next, Chas.

1480
01:27:33,677 --> 01:27:35,762
I have got
a really bad cramp.

1481
01:27:35,804 --> 01:27:38,098
I've been having
really bad cramps all week.

1482
01:27:38,140 --> 01:27:41,435
- It's probably menstrual.
- Screw you, Melon!

1483
01:27:44,104 --> 01:27:48,066
Coach Turnbull,
you got another eligible diver?

1484
01:27:50,485 --> 01:27:51,987
Melon!

1485
01:27:55,324 --> 01:27:59,620
Melon! We need ya!
Get your suit on!

1486
01:27:59,661 --> 01:28:00,787
Go ahead.

1487
01:28:00,829 --> 01:28:02,956
Oh, not a chance.
In the shape I'm in...

1488
01:28:02,998 --> 01:28:05,083
you could donate my body
to science fiction.

1489
01:28:05,167 --> 01:28:07,544
Get your suit on! We need ya!

1490
01:28:07,586 --> 01:28:10,922
Come on, pal.
Show 'em what you got.

1491
01:28:10,964 --> 01:28:13,300
Melon! We need ya!

1492
01:28:18,221 --> 01:28:22,809
Now diving in substitution
for Grand Lakes University...

1493
01:28:22,851 --> 01:28:25,270
Thornton Melon.

1494
01:28:27,147 --> 01:28:29,358
He's on my substitute roster...

1495
01:28:29,399 --> 01:28:31,944
but I don't have it right now.

1496
01:28:31,985 --> 01:28:35,697
But what I'll do is,
first chance I get...

1497
01:28:35,739 --> 01:28:37,282
I'll bring it to you.

1498
01:28:55,676 --> 01:28:58,095
What dive is he gonna do?

1499
01:28:58,136 --> 01:29:01,014
The Triple Lindy.

1500
01:29:01,056 --> 01:29:03,308
Melon! Melon! Melon!

1501
01:29:10,065 --> 01:29:12,651
There will be an additional
springboard installed...

1502
01:29:12,693 --> 01:29:15,529
for Melon's dive,
the Triple Lindy.

1503
01:29:15,570 --> 01:29:18,073
- Is that hard?
- It's impossible.

1504
01:30:41,615 --> 01:30:44,159
Melon! You did it!

1505
01:30:49,081 --> 01:30:50,457
That was great!

1506
01:30:55,045 --> 01:30:59,007
Oh, you were great!
That was incredible!

1507
01:30:59,049 --> 01:31:01,551
I guess there's nothing
you can't do.

1508
01:31:01,593 --> 01:31:03,762
I've got the results
of your exams right here.

1509
01:31:03,804 --> 01:31:04,888
Do I want to hear 'em?

1510
01:31:04,930 --> 01:31:07,516
You passed!
All "Ds" and an "A."

1511
01:31:07,557 --> 01:31:09,601
Who gave me the "A"?

1512
01:31:09,643 --> 01:31:11,937
- I did.
- Oh, yeah?

1513
01:31:11,979 --> 01:31:14,606
I would like to introduce
our speaker today.

1514
01:31:14,648 --> 01:31:16,066
This is the first time...

1515
01:31:16,108 --> 01:31:19,486
in the history
of this fine institution...

1516
01:31:19,528 --> 01:31:22,364
that a freshman
has given this address.

1517
01:31:22,406 --> 01:31:24,992
Mr. Thornton Melon.

1518
01:31:38,046 --> 01:31:39,172
Thank you very much.

1519
01:31:39,214 --> 01:31:41,967
Thank you, Dean Martin,
President Sinclair...

1520
01:31:42,050 --> 01:31:44,511
and members
of the graduating class.

1521
01:31:44,553 --> 01:31:47,389
I have only one thing
to say to you today...

1522
01:31:47,431 --> 01:31:48,807
it's a jungle out there.

1523
01:31:48,849 --> 01:31:51,393
You gotta look out
for number one.

1524
01:31:51,435 --> 01:31:54,229
But don't step in number two.

1525
01:31:55,731 --> 01:31:58,775
And so,
to all you graduates...

1526
01:31:58,817 --> 01:32:02,904
as you go out into the world
my advice to you is...

1527
01:32:02,946 --> 01:32:05,907
don't go!
It's rough out there.

1528
01:32:05,949 --> 01:32:08,910
Move back with your parents.
Let them worry about it.
