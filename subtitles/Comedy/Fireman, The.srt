1
00:00:10,608 --> 00:00:12,308
They were wearing a school uniform.

2
00:00:12,578 --> 00:00:14,278
Their heights were...

3
00:00:15,278 --> 00:00:17,708
almost 180cm.

4
00:00:18,608 --> 00:00:20,478
It was Gachon High School's uniform.

5
00:00:22,578 --> 00:00:27,137
(Two men, almost 180cm,
Gachon High School's uniform)

6
00:00:27,138 --> 00:00:28,438
Anything else?

7
00:00:29,408 --> 00:00:30,508
Well,

8
00:00:30,938 --> 00:00:33,808
we saw them running away from afar.

9
00:00:34,038 --> 00:00:35,648
We don't quite remember.

10
00:00:36,038 --> 00:00:38,337
He was wearing a blue hat...

11
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:40,108
and his shoes were white.

12
00:00:40,908 --> 00:00:44,808
Oh, and he had a huge
burn scar on his back.

13
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:49,578
You have a good memory.

14
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:52,108
If you remember the shape of the scar,

15
00:00:52,308 --> 00:00:54,108
can you draw it right here?

16
00:01:01,238 --> 00:01:02,778
Is there anything missing?

17
00:01:05,038 --> 00:01:07,208
Well, my goodness.

18
00:01:07,678 --> 00:01:09,708
That's the weird part.

19
00:01:10,608 --> 00:01:14,107
They stole all of my daughter's paintings.

20
00:01:14,108 --> 00:01:16,538
Gosh, they are bad guys.

21
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:21,238
Excuse me.

22
00:01:21,578 --> 00:01:24,307
I've been wondering for a while.

23
00:01:24,308 --> 00:01:26,678
Aren't you Mr. Han Gyeong Soo?

24
00:01:27,778 --> 00:01:30,677
Yes, I am.

25
00:01:30,678 --> 00:01:33,907
- I'm a huge fan of yours.
- Goodness.

26
00:01:33,908 --> 00:01:36,807
I even have a piece of your painting.

27
00:01:36,808 --> 00:01:39,038
My gosh, thank you.

28
00:01:40,938 --> 00:01:42,008
Goodness.

29
00:01:54,038 --> 00:01:57,178
Those burglars sneaked
back into the house...

30
00:01:57,308 --> 00:01:59,508
and committed that heinous crime.

31
00:03:20,008 --> 00:03:21,707
You said before...

32
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:24,537
that the perp is probably
proud of his crimes.

33
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:25,838
Wouldn't someone like that...

34
00:03:26,108 --> 00:03:28,578
hold onto the murder weapon?

35
00:03:39,038 --> 00:03:41,937
I'm sorry. It was an accident.

36
00:03:41,938 --> 00:03:43,578
I'll reimburse you.

37
00:03:45,108 --> 00:03:46,608
Are you leaving?

38
00:03:50,638 --> 00:03:53,038
Something just came up.

39
00:03:54,638 --> 00:03:55,778
What about your clothes?

40
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:00,438
That's right.

41
00:04:01,078 --> 00:04:02,408
I'll get them for you.

42
00:04:04,238 --> 00:04:05,278
Okay.

43
00:04:20,808 --> 00:04:22,048
Seong Jin.

44
00:04:28,508 --> 00:04:29,508
Thank you.

45
00:04:37,108 --> 00:04:38,908
Here's your modeling fee.

46
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:45,578
But...

47
00:04:46,608 --> 00:04:48,678
you didn't finish yet.

48
00:04:48,938 --> 00:04:51,008
I won't be painting anymore.

49
00:04:52,238 --> 00:04:53,238
Take it.

50
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:56,278
Okay.

51
00:05:01,548 --> 00:05:03,208
The painting was an excuse.

52
00:05:08,138 --> 00:05:10,808
I lied, too.

53
00:05:15,678 --> 00:05:16,938
I saw...

54
00:05:18,138 --> 00:05:20,238
that scar 10 years ago.

55
00:05:23,078 --> 00:05:24,638
Actually,

56
00:05:25,638 --> 00:05:29,078
I posted the fake ad looking
for a model with a scar...

57
00:05:29,608 --> 00:05:31,378
in order to meet you.

58
00:05:35,338 --> 00:05:36,738
To meet Seong...

59
00:05:37,738 --> 00:05:38,808
I mean,

60
00:05:40,338 --> 00:05:41,508
to meet me?

61
00:05:42,978 --> 00:05:44,038
Why?

62
00:05:45,238 --> 00:05:47,978
Don't you remember me?

63
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:56,178
We're pretty lucky, don't you think?

64
00:05:57,608 --> 00:05:59,238
Don't you know who I am?

65
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:10,238
Do you mean...

66
00:06:12,978 --> 00:06:15,938
you saw my scar 10 years ago?

67
00:06:17,278 --> 00:06:18,308
Sorry?

68
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:21,008
That's why you looked for me?

69
00:06:21,638 --> 00:06:23,378
So that's...

70
00:06:25,308 --> 00:06:27,508
Oh, my. When did you get back?

71
00:06:33,338 --> 00:06:34,978
Where did you go?

72
00:06:35,178 --> 00:06:38,008
What? I went to the department store.

73
00:06:40,008 --> 00:06:41,378
Without your purse?

74
00:06:41,638 --> 00:06:42,638
What?

75
00:06:43,738 --> 00:06:44,878
Well...

76
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,608
It was more to take a walk and look around.

77
00:06:49,438 --> 00:06:52,338
But what were you doing
just standing there?

78
00:06:54,638 --> 00:06:55,708
Okay, then.

79
00:06:56,638 --> 00:06:58,238
I'll see you again next time.

80
00:07:03,008 --> 00:07:05,808
I have a lot of time now. I'm off duty...

81
00:07:07,938 --> 00:07:09,408
Off duty?

82
00:07:13,438 --> 00:07:15,908
My part-time job has three shifts.

83
00:07:17,178 --> 00:07:19,854
I'd like to see you quietly next time.

84
00:07:19,878 --> 00:07:22,338
I need time to organize my thoughts, too.

85
00:07:23,738 --> 00:07:24,808
Me, too.

86
00:07:28,308 --> 00:07:29,338
Then...

87
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:31,878
I'll go...

88
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:35,608
for now.

89
00:07:39,738 --> 00:07:42,178
Go. I'll walk you out.

90
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:55,608
I guess the modeling gig is over already.

91
00:07:57,938 --> 00:07:59,308
Pretty much.

92
00:08:00,108 --> 00:08:01,608
You must be relieved.

93
00:08:01,838 --> 00:08:05,008
You don't need to see
that bossy brat anymore.

94
00:08:07,108 --> 00:08:09,007
Aren't you tired of dating secretly?

95
00:08:09,008 --> 00:08:10,478
Why don't you just come clean?

96
00:08:11,538 --> 00:08:14,878
Jin Ah is too closed-minded.
She wouldn't understand.

97
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:17,078
But...

98
00:08:17,678 --> 00:08:19,208
I have a question.

99
00:08:20,638 --> 00:08:22,437
- Hello.
- Hello.

100
00:08:22,438 --> 00:08:24,378
Where did you go at this hour?

101
00:08:25,808 --> 00:08:28,138
You said you wanted sandwiches.

102
00:08:29,078 --> 00:08:30,478
That's right.

103
00:08:31,278 --> 00:08:32,678
Leave them on the table.

104
00:08:37,648 --> 00:08:39,308
What was your question?

105
00:08:40,808 --> 00:08:41,938
Well,

106
00:08:43,978 --> 00:08:45,878
there's a woman...

107
00:08:46,378 --> 00:08:48,208
who is looking for someone after 10 years.

108
00:08:48,908 --> 00:08:52,578
What do you think she's thinking?

109
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:05,938
Earlier,

110
00:09:07,938 --> 00:09:10,408
it wasn't something that anyone could do.

111
00:09:14,648 --> 00:09:16,148
You seem like a good person.

112
00:09:18,378 --> 00:09:19,608
And...

113
00:09:23,408 --> 00:09:24,538
thank you for today.

114
00:09:33,378 --> 00:09:34,538
Jin Ah.

115
00:09:35,178 --> 00:09:36,178
What is it?

116
00:09:36,808 --> 00:09:40,978
I have a strange feeling about this.

117
00:09:46,508 --> 00:09:47,938
Look. Look.

118
00:09:58,878 --> 00:10:02,807
Oh my gosh. She's giving
you the green light.

119
00:10:02,808 --> 00:10:04,408
Good luck.

120
00:10:04,608 --> 00:10:06,378
Are you sure about that?

121
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:09,278
Why did she ignore me all this time, then?

122
00:10:10,378 --> 00:10:13,077
That woman couldn't forget you...

123
00:10:13,078 --> 00:10:14,707
and found you after 10 years.

124
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:17,177
But you didn't remember her,

125
00:10:17,178 --> 00:10:18,878
so she was hurt.

126
00:10:21,908 --> 00:10:24,178
What do you think about her?

127
00:10:25,938 --> 00:10:27,778
What do you think?

128
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:30,438
Well...

129
00:10:33,078 --> 00:10:34,078
I...

130
00:10:35,508 --> 00:10:37,308
I don't know about anything else,

131
00:10:39,738 --> 00:10:41,038
but I'm curious about her.

132
00:10:41,148 --> 00:10:43,538
What? What?

133
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:48,708
Those two...

134
00:10:49,308 --> 00:10:51,778
were talking about dating secretly.

135
00:10:54,178 --> 00:10:56,338
But something else bothers me.

136
00:10:58,538 --> 00:10:59,978
Look at this.

137
00:11:02,738 --> 00:11:05,177
Your aunt was holding
this for a long time...

138
00:11:05,178 --> 00:11:08,478
in front of the safe while you were out.

139
00:11:20,108 --> 00:11:22,608
What's so complicated?

140
00:11:23,008 --> 00:11:27,208
She could not have come
up with this herself.

141
00:11:29,308 --> 00:11:32,638
Maybe the two of them
are planning something.

142
00:13:00,608 --> 00:13:02,538
- It's finally over.
- It's finally over.

143
00:13:08,338 --> 00:13:09,808
What's over for you?

144
00:13:09,938 --> 00:13:12,338
What? Well...

145
00:13:13,908 --> 00:13:16,208
You. I meant you.

146
00:13:16,408 --> 00:13:19,138
You got paid. Lucky you.

147
00:13:21,978 --> 00:13:23,237
What's wrong?

148
00:13:23,238 --> 00:13:25,138
You made 10,000 dollars in 4 days.

149
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:29,638
I'm going to have to tell
her the truth tomorrow.

150
00:13:30,138 --> 00:13:31,138
About what?

151
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:33,378
About lying about my identity.
I don't like it.

152
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:36,838
Hey, you already finished.
Why are you doing this?

153
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:38,808
What if she reports you?

154
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:42,308
Well...

155
00:13:44,138 --> 00:13:46,738
she doesn't even know my real name yet.

156
00:14:31,808 --> 00:14:33,408
Do you like her?

157
00:14:35,738 --> 00:14:36,808
Is it obvious?

158
00:14:37,538 --> 00:14:39,577
You took the job to make money.

159
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:42,038
You got paid so it's over.

160
00:14:48,038 --> 00:14:49,837
You wished me luck.

161
00:14:49,838 --> 00:14:52,007
I meant to have fun while you were working.

162
00:14:52,008 --> 00:14:54,178
I didn't mean stick
around after you finish.

163
00:14:54,408 --> 00:14:55,777
Some guys always waste their time...

164
00:14:55,778 --> 00:14:58,378
at the very end and ruin everything.
Like you.

165
00:14:58,578 --> 00:15:01,207
Why are you so pessimistic?

166
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:02,937
It may work out.

167
00:15:02,938 --> 00:15:05,677
Did you forget you're lying
to her to make money?

168
00:15:05,678 --> 00:15:07,978
You're making me sound
like a really bad guy.

169
00:15:08,938 --> 00:15:10,477
Just give me the keys.

170
00:15:10,478 --> 00:15:12,007
I gave them to you earlier.

171
00:15:12,008 --> 00:15:13,908
What? That's right.

172
00:15:14,408 --> 00:15:15,638
Darn it.

173
00:15:16,238 --> 00:15:18,478
Why is there so much in here?

174
00:15:23,238 --> 00:15:24,338
Pick them up.

175
00:15:31,308 --> 00:15:33,438
That useless punk.

176
00:15:34,338 --> 00:15:39,078
His friend says he met a
woman he's interested in,

177
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:43,278
but rather than helping,
he makes me pick up coins.

178
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:08,607
- What is it?
- A thief.

179
00:16:08,608 --> 00:16:09,608
What?

180
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,178
Stop right there.

181
00:16:18,738 --> 00:16:19,738
Stop right there.

182
00:18:21,178 --> 00:18:22,178
Hey.

183
00:18:22,438 --> 00:18:24,348
Nothing's missing. Come back.

184
00:18:26,178 --> 00:18:27,408
Okay.

185
00:18:37,078 --> 00:18:38,738
Was there really a break-in?

186
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:41,408
But none of the boxes were opened.

187
00:18:43,348 --> 00:18:44,937
Who cares if you get robbed?

188
00:18:44,938 --> 00:18:46,637
What do you have to lose here?

189
00:18:46,638 --> 00:18:49,137
All we need is this.

190
00:18:49,138 --> 00:18:51,907
What about Jin Ah? Did
she suspect anything?

191
00:18:51,908 --> 00:18:54,778
No. She had no clue.

192
00:18:58,478 --> 00:19:01,008
What happened? Did you lose him?

193
00:19:03,508 --> 00:19:05,038
I didn't lose him.

194
00:19:05,538 --> 00:19:06,878
He disappeared.

195
00:19:08,408 --> 00:19:10,037
What are you talking about?

196
00:19:10,038 --> 00:19:11,138
I don't know.

197
00:19:12,008 --> 00:19:14,808
- I'm leaving.
- Hey. Hey.

198
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:16,878
Stay the night.

199
00:19:18,308 --> 00:19:19,508
It's okay.

200
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:22,307
I have things to do, too. See you later.

201
00:19:22,308 --> 00:19:23,508
Bye.

202
00:19:27,178 --> 00:19:29,238
Let me drive him to the bus terminal.

203
00:19:29,438 --> 00:19:31,208
- Hurry back.
- Okay.

204
00:20:15,938 --> 00:20:19,408
Back then, at least she was cute.

205
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:23,578
Did you forget something?

206
00:20:24,678 --> 00:20:25,738
Jin Ah.

207
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:32,678
Jin Ah, how did you...

208
00:20:33,538 --> 00:20:35,738
The reason I'm here is...

209
00:20:36,038 --> 00:20:37,847
Let me explain.

210
00:20:37,848 --> 00:20:39,938
You must be curious.

211
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:42,348
Do you want to sit?

212
00:20:59,878 --> 00:21:01,978
Jin Ah, the thing is...

213
00:21:02,978 --> 00:21:05,848
Let's sit down and talk.

214
00:21:36,678 --> 00:21:38,014
Hi, Jin Ah.

215
00:21:38,038 --> 00:21:39,108
Mister.

216
00:21:39,508 --> 00:21:41,178
You were right.

217
00:21:41,478 --> 00:21:42,808
Is something wrong?

218
00:21:43,078 --> 00:21:44,578
It's like you said.

219
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:46,408
Oh Seong Jin...

220
00:21:47,078 --> 00:21:48,678
stole my paintings.

221
00:21:50,538 --> 00:21:52,308
I'll leave everything to you.

222
00:21:53,138 --> 00:21:55,578
Okay, Jin Ah.

223
00:21:57,038 --> 00:21:59,008
Step away and watch.

224
00:22:00,578 --> 00:22:02,078
I will deal with everything.

225
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:11,578
You can wait here.

226
00:22:11,838 --> 00:22:13,578
Who... Who...

227
00:22:15,308 --> 00:22:17,408
Whom did you just call?

228
00:22:22,338 --> 00:22:23,477
You heard correctly.

229
00:22:23,478 --> 00:22:26,208
Did you call the police?

230
00:22:27,308 --> 00:22:30,608
A criminal must pay for his crime.

231
00:22:31,678 --> 00:22:33,307
Here we are.

232
00:22:33,308 --> 00:22:34,978
- See you.
- Bye.

233
00:22:38,638 --> 00:22:41,778
Hey, you forgot your backpack.

234
00:22:43,878 --> 00:22:45,238
Remember what I said.

235
00:22:45,778 --> 00:22:48,277
You can never tell what a person is like.

236
00:22:48,278 --> 00:22:50,208
Things can get really twisted.

237
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:53,238
Stay out of my love life.

238
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,638
Does she even like you?

239
00:22:56,478 --> 00:22:57,678
Go home.

240
00:22:59,408 --> 00:23:01,578
I've had enough of him.

241
00:23:16,608 --> 00:23:18,608
(Don't come here, Seong Jin.)

242
00:23:19,608 --> 00:23:20,777
Whom are you texting?

243
00:23:20,778 --> 00:23:22,038
Let go.

244
00:23:22,678 --> 00:23:25,508
No. It's too late.

245
00:23:37,608 --> 00:23:39,038
Mr. Oh Seong Jin?

246
00:23:45,778 --> 00:23:48,278
How could you fall for someone like him?

247
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:51,638
He made a woman con someone else.

248
00:23:53,178 --> 00:23:55,208
Do you think he won't con you?

249
00:23:55,678 --> 00:23:57,077
Get a grip.

250
00:23:57,078 --> 00:23:58,378
What do you know?

251
00:23:58,808 --> 00:24:01,008
What do you know about Seong Jin?

252
00:24:01,308 --> 00:24:02,677
He's a good man.

253
00:24:02,678 --> 00:24:05,807
He's the nicest man in the
world, at least to me.

254
00:24:05,808 --> 00:24:07,638
That's what he does.

255
00:24:07,908 --> 00:24:09,737
He nabs a foolish woman...

256
00:24:09,738 --> 00:24:11,708
and bleeds her dry.

257
00:24:12,778 --> 00:24:15,637
All he thinks about is how
to use you and get out.

258
00:24:15,638 --> 00:24:16,908
You're just clueless.

259
00:24:18,538 --> 00:24:19,678
You opened up...

260
00:24:20,938 --> 00:24:22,208
and relied on him.

261
00:24:24,678 --> 00:24:25,978
And even thought...

262
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:30,308
maybe he's the one you've been looking for.

263
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:34,808
You had hopes...

264
00:24:37,138 --> 00:24:38,338
and got excited.

265
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:44,638
What a fool.

266
00:24:47,938 --> 00:24:50,078
- You jerk.
- Hang on.

267
00:24:50,778 --> 00:24:52,008
Oh Seong Jin.

268
00:24:52,108 --> 00:24:54,507
You're under arrest for
trespassing and burglary.

269
00:24:54,508 --> 00:24:56,838
- Wait, wait.
- Be still.

270
00:25:05,538 --> 00:25:06,677
Hello.

271
00:25:06,678 --> 00:25:07,878
We got him.

272
00:25:08,908 --> 00:25:09,978
We're outside.

273
00:25:10,778 --> 00:25:11,778
Okay.

274
00:25:12,908 --> 00:25:14,038
I'll come down.

275
00:25:20,478 --> 00:25:23,437
What if you hurt him? Don't be so rough.

276
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:25,177
Get out of the way...

277
00:25:25,178 --> 00:25:27,677
before we arrest you for
obstruction of justice.

278
00:25:27,678 --> 00:25:30,537
Exactly. Arrest me instead.

279
00:25:30,538 --> 00:25:32,977
How many times must I tell you?
I'm the thief.

280
00:25:32,978 --> 00:25:34,377
Let him go.

281
00:25:34,378 --> 00:25:36,137
- Take me instead.
- I'll get a warrant...

282
00:25:36,138 --> 00:25:37,637
and search his place tomorrow.

283
00:25:37,638 --> 00:25:39,238
Will you be quiet, Woman?

284
00:25:40,738 --> 00:25:42,978
Did you just call me, "Woman"?

285
00:25:44,078 --> 00:25:45,808
You aren't a man.

286
00:25:46,438 --> 00:25:47,977
What's the punishment for assault?

287
00:25:47,978 --> 00:25:49,838
- This is unbelievable.
- What?

288
00:25:51,578 --> 00:25:53,477
I'm not that old.

289
00:25:53,478 --> 00:25:56,278
People think I'm 10 years
younger than I really am.

290
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:58,178
Oh Seong Jin.

291
00:26:13,578 --> 00:26:14,608
Who are you?

292
00:26:16,378 --> 00:26:17,638
To Gachon, please.

293
00:26:17,838 --> 00:26:20,438
It just left. The next bus is in two hours.

294
00:26:20,978 --> 00:26:22,508
Okay. That'll do.

295
00:26:26,638 --> 00:26:27,838
Watch your head.

296
00:26:31,538 --> 00:26:34,378
That's not Oh Seong Jin.

297
00:26:34,538 --> 00:26:37,677
What did you just say?

298
00:26:37,678 --> 00:26:39,638
He's not the man...

299
00:26:39,908 --> 00:26:41,577
I've been meeting.

300
00:26:41,578 --> 00:26:44,207
That's Oh Seong Jin. I'm positive.

301
00:26:44,208 --> 00:26:45,208
Look at this.

302
00:26:45,908 --> 00:26:46,978
See?

303
00:26:49,038 --> 00:26:50,608
I never met him until today.

304
00:27:00,278 --> 00:27:02,777
What happened to your hand?

305
00:27:02,778 --> 00:27:03,978
You're hurt.

306
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:07,938
I fell while rushing out after you called.

307
00:27:08,438 --> 00:27:09,438
Jin Ah.

308
00:27:10,538 --> 00:27:13,378
Find your Oh Seong Jin and
figure out what happened.

309
00:27:48,438 --> 00:27:51,137
Did you forget you're lying
to her to make money?

310
00:27:51,138 --> 00:27:53,308
You're making me sound
like a really bad guy.

311
00:27:54,278 --> 00:27:55,878
Just give me the keys.

312
00:28:12,978 --> 00:28:13,978
Excuse me.

313
00:28:14,678 --> 00:28:16,108
You dropped this.

314
00:28:17,838 --> 00:28:19,408
Thank you.

315
00:28:26,708 --> 00:28:30,037
I'm the one who left with the paintings.

316
00:28:30,038 --> 00:28:33,777
He knew nothing. He just
watched the bag for me.

317
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:34,778
Right.

318
00:28:35,208 --> 00:28:37,978
Song Ja, you went a little too far.

319
00:28:38,078 --> 00:28:40,778
If you two had issues, you
should've talked it out.

320
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:44,378
Why did you hide her paintings?
That's childish.

321
00:28:44,578 --> 00:28:46,038
I know, right?

322
00:28:48,538 --> 00:28:51,378
Do you want to sue her?

323
00:28:52,238 --> 00:28:53,608
I'm really sorry.

324
00:28:53,808 --> 00:28:56,038
I pranked you out of anger.

325
00:28:56,308 --> 00:28:59,037
You nagged me about spending too much.

326
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:01,477
Detective, this is a family issue.

327
00:29:01,478 --> 00:29:04,538
We don't need your help with anything.

328
00:29:06,008 --> 00:29:09,007
Jin Ah, let's talk about this at home.

329
00:29:09,008 --> 00:29:10,138
We have...

330
00:29:14,438 --> 00:29:17,138
Shouldn't we hear Cheol
Soo's side of the story?

331
00:29:22,008 --> 00:29:24,738
You can release them for now.

332
00:29:34,008 --> 00:29:35,437
It's true.

333
00:29:35,438 --> 00:29:38,807
Cheol Soo didn't want to
tell he was a civil servant,

334
00:29:38,808 --> 00:29:41,008
so he borrowed Seong Jin's name.

335
00:29:41,208 --> 00:29:44,484
Seong Jin and Cheol Soo
are really close friends.

336
00:29:44,508 --> 00:29:46,037
So close I'm jealous.

337
00:29:46,038 --> 00:29:48,707
Try to understand in
return for slapping me.

338
00:29:48,708 --> 00:29:50,978
You didn't suffer any losses.

339
00:29:56,638 --> 00:29:59,508
How long have you known Cheol Soo?

340
00:30:03,278 --> 00:30:04,978
We grew up together.

341
00:30:06,778 --> 00:30:09,138
Then you must've jumped the
villa's wall together.

342
00:30:10,078 --> 00:30:11,108
What?

343
00:30:15,208 --> 00:30:16,308
Jin Ah.

344
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:24,638
Kang Cheol Soo.

345
00:30:25,808 --> 00:30:28,738
He's a fireman with Gachon Fire and Safety.

346
00:30:31,808 --> 00:30:33,178
Where is he now?

347
00:30:34,338 --> 00:30:36,038
At the bus terminal.

348
00:30:39,008 --> 00:30:42,278
Jeong Nam. This Cheol Soo guy...

349
00:30:43,038 --> 00:30:46,338
He seems even less like a murderer now.

350
00:30:46,838 --> 00:30:50,807
We should consider someone
dressed up like him.

351
00:30:50,808 --> 00:30:52,038
Does he have...

352
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:55,438
the scar you saw as a child?

353
00:30:59,108 --> 00:31:00,178
Does he?

354
00:31:03,678 --> 00:31:04,678
He does.

355
00:31:07,278 --> 00:31:10,308
You just have to do that. Tell the truth.

356
00:31:13,478 --> 00:31:16,708
- But...
- I told you to stay away from your aunt.

357
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:18,808
Was I wrong?

358
00:31:25,138 --> 00:31:27,878
You should go home. It's late.

359
00:31:30,738 --> 00:31:32,108
What will you do now?

360
00:31:35,178 --> 00:31:38,338
A civil servant committed
theft under a false identity.

361
00:31:39,338 --> 00:31:41,308
We need to catch him and investigate.

362
00:31:42,308 --> 00:31:43,308
What?

363
00:32:05,608 --> 00:32:08,708
I saw something else, too.

364
00:32:09,278 --> 00:32:10,338
What?

365
00:32:13,438 --> 00:32:14,508
What was it?

366
00:32:30,978 --> 00:32:33,478
I'm writing for the first
time from my phone.

367
00:32:33,878 --> 00:32:35,778
Actually, I lied, too.

368
00:32:36,378 --> 00:32:38,307
My name is not Oh Seong Jin.

369
00:32:38,308 --> 00:32:39,808
My real name...

370
00:32:40,478 --> 00:32:41,878
is Kang Cheol Soo.

371
00:32:45,008 --> 00:32:46,538
No, no, no.

372
00:33:04,138 --> 00:33:06,208
Are you looking for something?

373
00:33:07,338 --> 00:33:09,608
Well... Yes.

374
00:33:09,808 --> 00:33:12,277
I need to apologize to a woman.

375
00:33:12,278 --> 00:33:13,577
Your girlfriend?

376
00:33:13,578 --> 00:33:15,537
- No.
- Then a fling?

377
00:33:15,538 --> 00:33:17,377
- It's not like that.
- Is she pretty?

378
00:33:17,378 --> 00:33:18,378
Yes.

379
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:22,207
There's a popular item that men...

380
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:25,538
give to their girlfriends.
Would you like to see it?

381
00:33:26,378 --> 00:33:27,677
She isn't my girlfriend.

382
00:33:27,678 --> 00:33:29,384
Let me see what's popular.

383
00:33:29,408 --> 00:33:30,478
Okay.

384
00:33:34,138 --> 00:33:35,138
Here.

385
00:33:42,178 --> 00:33:43,238
Is this perfume?

386
00:33:43,608 --> 00:33:45,078
It's similar.

387
00:33:45,738 --> 00:33:46,837
May I smell it?

388
00:33:46,838 --> 00:33:49,738
Wait. If you want to smell it,

389
00:33:49,878 --> 00:33:52,378
you should call an ambulance first.

390
00:33:53,678 --> 00:33:54,678
Pardon?

391
00:34:01,508 --> 00:34:03,577
Why weren't you picking up?

392
00:34:03,578 --> 00:34:05,007
I was busy. What is it?

393
00:34:05,008 --> 00:34:07,307
- Look around.
- What?

394
00:34:07,308 --> 00:34:09,637
A man in his late 40s, almost 180cm tall,

395
00:34:09,638 --> 00:34:12,748
black jacket, pants, and shoes.
Do you see him?

396
00:34:21,538 --> 00:34:22,807
Who is he?

397
00:34:22,808 --> 00:34:25,078
Run. If he catches you, you're dead.

398
00:34:25,678 --> 00:34:27,578
What do you mean? Why?

399
00:34:27,678 --> 00:34:30,108
I'll tell you later. Just run!

400
00:34:31,878 --> 00:34:33,638
This is crazy.

401
00:34:33,908 --> 00:34:35,577
Who is he? Why is he following me?

402
00:34:35,578 --> 00:34:37,878
What did you do now?

403
00:34:41,208 --> 00:34:42,638
I'll explain in person.

404
00:34:42,878 --> 00:34:45,108
Hide somewhere safe and then call me back.

405
00:35:49,638 --> 00:35:50,708
Where are you?

406
00:35:50,878 --> 00:35:52,537
What's going on?

407
00:35:52,538 --> 00:35:54,177
Did you use my name with a loan shark?

408
00:35:54,178 --> 00:35:55,638
He's a cop.

409
00:35:56,178 --> 00:35:57,208
What?

410
00:36:34,248 --> 00:36:35,808
Why is a cop after me?

411
00:36:36,008 --> 00:36:38,578
I'll explain later. Where are you?

412
00:36:38,678 --> 00:36:39,808
I'm in the bathroom...

413
00:36:55,308 --> 00:36:56,377
Kang Cheol Soo.

414
00:36:56,378 --> 00:36:58,577
Yes? Pardon?

415
00:36:58,578 --> 00:37:01,108
Open up. This is the police.

416
00:37:03,908 --> 00:37:05,508
Are you really a cop?

417
00:37:13,248 --> 00:37:14,308
(Gwon Jeong Nam)

418
00:37:15,808 --> 00:37:18,307
Hey. He really is a cop.

419
00:37:18,308 --> 00:37:19,977
I told you that already!

420
00:37:19,978 --> 00:37:22,437
He knows what you did and
is trying to catch you!

421
00:37:22,438 --> 00:37:25,808
- What?
- Han Jin Ah reported you for fraud.

422
00:37:26,538 --> 00:37:28,338
- Open up.
- Hello?

423
00:37:28,838 --> 00:37:29,908
Cheol Soo.

424
00:37:30,308 --> 00:37:32,607
What are you doing? Answer me. Hey!

425
00:37:32,608 --> 00:37:33,678
Cheol Soo!

426
00:37:40,378 --> 00:37:41,408
Later.

427
00:37:43,378 --> 00:37:44,508
Darn it.

428
00:38:06,978 --> 00:38:08,038
Did...

429
00:38:09,248 --> 00:38:10,708
Jin Ah...

430
00:38:12,608 --> 00:38:14,178
really report me?

431
00:38:15,008 --> 00:38:16,538
Give me your bag first.

432
00:38:16,778 --> 00:38:18,508
- My bag?
- It's protocol.

433
00:38:22,408 --> 00:38:23,408
But...

434
00:38:24,248 --> 00:38:26,108
you seem very familiar.

435
00:38:28,108 --> 00:38:29,308
Where did I see you before?

436
00:38:33,278 --> 00:38:35,838
Earlier, by the rooftop apartment, right?

437
00:38:37,538 --> 00:38:39,878
It is you. It's the same outfit, too.

438
00:38:40,338 --> 00:38:41,677
What were you doing there?

439
00:38:41,678 --> 00:38:43,538
Why did you run if you're a cop?

440
00:38:51,138 --> 00:38:52,608
Where did you see me?

441
00:38:53,508 --> 00:38:55,078
Earlier...

442
00:38:56,278 --> 00:38:57,507
by the rooftop apartment.

443
00:38:57,508 --> 00:39:00,638
- Hey.
- It was you.

444
00:39:14,308 --> 00:39:16,438
What are you doing?

445
00:39:40,808 --> 00:39:41,808
You know...

446
00:39:42,078 --> 00:39:44,907
- they're real bullets from now on.
- Sorry?

447
00:39:44,908 --> 00:39:48,007
Not only did you resist
arrest, you assaulted...

448
00:39:48,008 --> 00:39:50,778
the officer, took his
gun, and threatened him.

449
00:39:51,378 --> 00:39:52,678
Why did you do it?

450
00:39:54,748 --> 00:39:57,248
When... When did I do that?

451
00:39:58,538 --> 00:40:00,207
You did it to yourself...

452
00:40:00,208 --> 00:40:01,308
Now,

453
00:40:01,678 --> 00:40:04,007
after a struggle, the gun
will be fired by mistake,

454
00:40:04,008 --> 00:40:05,838
and the bullet will go here.

455
00:40:08,178 --> 00:40:09,878
Why are you doing this to me?

456
00:40:10,778 --> 00:40:13,207
Why are you doing this to me?

457
00:40:13,208 --> 00:40:14,478
What about you?

458
00:40:15,748 --> 00:40:18,308
Why did you have to recognize me?

459
00:40:37,778 --> 00:40:39,638
Why... You!

460
00:40:54,838 --> 00:40:56,438
What are you doing? Get in!

461
00:41:00,538 --> 00:41:01,538
Hurry.

462
00:41:08,178 --> 00:41:09,608
He tried to kill me.

463
00:41:11,638 --> 00:41:13,208
He really tried to kill me.

464
00:41:14,508 --> 00:41:17,337
Let's go to the police station. Right now.

465
00:41:17,338 --> 00:41:19,407
- Give me your phone.
- What?

466
00:41:19,408 --> 00:41:21,008
Give me your cell phone.

467
00:41:21,308 --> 00:41:23,478
Okay. Here.

468
00:41:26,008 --> 00:41:27,907
What are you doing?

469
00:41:27,908 --> 00:41:28,977
Open the glove compartment.

470
00:41:28,978 --> 00:41:30,207
Why did you throw out my phone?

471
00:41:30,208 --> 00:41:31,878
Just do as you're told!

472
00:41:36,208 --> 00:41:37,278
Open it.

473
00:41:38,108 --> 00:41:39,108
Okay.

474
00:41:46,508 --> 00:41:47,707
What's this?

475
00:41:47,708 --> 00:41:49,808
An untraceable phone. Use that.

476
00:41:52,208 --> 00:41:53,208
What for?

477
00:41:53,938 --> 00:41:56,807
Han Jin Ah and the detective baited you.

478
00:41:56,808 --> 00:41:59,838
To find or make up evidence
to arrest you with.

479
00:42:04,248 --> 00:42:06,507
The nude model deal was a ruse.

480
00:42:06,508 --> 00:42:09,278
They tried to put you behind bars!

481
00:42:14,678 --> 00:42:16,008
What did I do?

482
00:42:19,538 --> 00:42:21,078
What did I do?

483
00:42:33,578 --> 00:42:34,808
You did it.

484
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:36,908
10 years ago.

485
00:42:37,808 --> 00:42:39,908
The couple murdered at
the villa in our town...

486
00:42:41,478 --> 00:42:42,538
What?

487
00:42:43,908 --> 00:42:45,608
You don't have to lie to me.

488
00:42:45,908 --> 00:42:47,378
I saw everything.

489
00:42:48,338 --> 00:42:50,278
- Saw what?
- That night,

490
00:42:51,138 --> 00:42:52,678
I saw you leave...

491
00:42:53,638 --> 00:42:54,978
the burning villa.

492
00:42:58,708 --> 00:43:01,007
You must be kidding me. Are you insane?

493
00:43:01,008 --> 00:43:02,308
Go into hiding.

494
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:04,538
I'll find you a boat out.

495
00:43:08,748 --> 00:43:09,778
Do you mean...

496
00:43:10,708 --> 00:43:13,138
Han Jin Ah looked for me on purpose?

497
00:43:14,778 --> 00:43:15,978
What for?

498
00:43:17,978 --> 00:43:19,708
She's the dead couple's daughter.

499
00:43:22,138 --> 00:43:23,248
Han Jin Ah.

500
00:43:25,708 --> 00:43:27,037
She said she saw you.

501
00:43:27,038 --> 00:43:29,538
Your scar, to be exact.

502
00:43:50,138 --> 00:43:51,578
If they get you now,

503
00:43:52,208 --> 00:43:54,008
they'll put you away for murder.

504
00:44:09,878 --> 00:44:11,207
- Where are you going?
- To the police.

505
00:44:11,208 --> 00:44:12,538
It's all over!

506
00:44:12,878 --> 00:44:14,877
They set the trap for you!

507
00:44:14,878 --> 00:44:16,078
It wasn't me!

508
00:44:21,978 --> 00:44:23,338
I didn't do it.

509
00:44:26,808 --> 00:44:28,238
Then who did it?

510
00:44:29,178 --> 00:44:30,377
I saw...

511
00:44:30,378 --> 00:44:31,638
I don't know!

512
00:44:32,308 --> 00:44:34,078
Maybe your eyes need testing.

513
00:44:42,138 --> 00:44:43,807
The policeman who
singlehandedly fought off...

514
00:44:43,808 --> 00:44:45,877
the armed assailant...

515
00:44:45,878 --> 00:44:47,937
was rushed to the hospital...

516
00:44:47,938 --> 00:44:50,108
with a broken nose and other injuries.

517
00:44:54,308 --> 00:44:55,837
Must you really do this?

518
00:44:55,838 --> 00:44:58,937
I apologized. I said I'm sorry.

519
00:44:58,938 --> 00:45:01,808
I can't live with someone
who stole from me.

520
00:45:02,438 --> 00:45:05,337
Do you care more about money
than your only relative?

521
00:45:05,338 --> 00:45:06,408
Who knows?

522
00:45:07,308 --> 00:45:09,138
It might not end with theft.

523
00:45:09,738 --> 00:45:11,038
What do you mean?

524
00:45:11,178 --> 00:45:13,238
It'll all become yours once I die.

525
00:45:13,608 --> 00:45:15,378
You won't need to steal then.

526
00:45:16,108 --> 00:45:19,037
Is that what you think of me?

527
00:45:19,038 --> 00:45:20,578
That's what I see.

528
00:45:24,838 --> 00:45:27,737
I knew it would end like this.

529
00:45:27,738 --> 00:45:29,637
I knew this would happen.

530
00:45:29,638 --> 00:45:31,108
That's why I did it.

531
00:45:31,578 --> 00:45:33,307
To get something out of you...

532
00:45:33,308 --> 00:45:34,878
before you kicked me out.

533
00:45:50,178 --> 00:45:53,537
A man assaulted a police
officer who only wished...

534
00:45:53,538 --> 00:45:55,438
to ask questions, and then fled.

535
00:45:55,708 --> 00:45:58,638
He even took and shot the officer's gun.

536
00:45:58,978 --> 00:46:01,938
What's shocking is that he's a fireman.

537
00:46:02,438 --> 00:46:04,138
Yoo Jong Hee has the details.

538
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:06,177
The weapon...

539
00:46:06,178 --> 00:46:08,914
found in Fireman Kang Cheol Soo's bag...

540
00:46:08,938 --> 00:46:11,837
is reported to have been used in...

541
00:46:11,838 --> 00:46:13,937
the murder of famed
artist Han Gyeong Soo...

542
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:16,778
at his Gachon villa 10 years ago.

543
00:46:22,638 --> 00:46:23,837
Do you work here?

544
00:46:23,838 --> 00:46:25,938
We have nothing to say. Sorry.

545
00:46:26,338 --> 00:46:29,377
Fireman Kang Cheol Soo has
been missing for two days...

546
00:46:29,378 --> 00:46:33,078
and is reported to have
had many issues at work.

547
00:46:34,338 --> 00:46:36,937
You don't know how violent he is.

548
00:46:36,938 --> 00:46:40,008
He actually pushed me off a roof.

549
00:46:40,278 --> 00:46:41,637
It was unbelievable.

550
00:46:41,638 --> 00:46:44,507
I calmly suggested we talk it out...

551
00:46:44,508 --> 00:46:47,238
but he grabbed me by the collar.

552
00:46:50,478 --> 00:46:52,538
I don't believe it.

553
00:46:52,978 --> 00:46:55,638
He was actually a murderer.

554
00:46:56,408 --> 00:46:59,038
You never know what will happen.

555
00:46:59,438 --> 00:47:01,007
I guess you can't.

556
00:47:01,008 --> 00:47:03,838
He looked so normal.

557
00:47:04,938 --> 00:47:08,408
But then again, looks can be deceiving.

558
00:47:08,538 --> 00:47:11,438
I guess they can.

559
00:47:17,438 --> 00:47:20,608
Why is this window stuck?

560
00:47:21,738 --> 00:47:24,978
We should call someone to fix it.

561
00:47:25,738 --> 00:47:27,038
Oh dear.

562
00:47:33,678 --> 00:47:35,078
Why is there...

563
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:37,378
aspirin in this house?

564
00:47:38,338 --> 00:47:41,338
You know we can't have that in here.

565
00:47:43,308 --> 00:47:44,338
Oh dear.

566
00:47:44,908 --> 00:47:46,078
Sorry.

567
00:47:46,608 --> 00:47:49,508
I've been having bad headaches.

568
00:47:49,738 --> 00:47:52,908
I bought some this morning.
I must've dropped them.

569
00:47:55,978 --> 00:47:57,008
Jeong Soon.

570
00:47:57,838 --> 00:47:58,838
What?

571
00:47:59,878 --> 00:48:01,138
Get out.

572
00:48:02,978 --> 00:48:04,108
What?

573
00:48:05,208 --> 00:48:07,378
I find it very uncomfortable.

574
00:48:08,478 --> 00:48:10,508
Being in the same place as...

575
00:48:11,038 --> 00:48:12,638
someone who knows me well.

576
00:48:49,638 --> 00:48:51,038
(Unarmed Detective Fights Criminal)

577
00:48:58,138 --> 00:49:01,678
(Unarmed Detective Fights Criminal)

578
00:49:16,608 --> 00:49:17,738
Give me that.

579
00:49:20,378 --> 00:49:21,378
Jeong Nam.

580
00:49:21,379 --> 00:49:22,438
Hello.

581
00:49:23,438 --> 00:49:24,838
Are you getting discharged?

582
00:49:25,108 --> 00:49:27,908
I can't stay here. I need
to find and arrest the guy.

583
00:49:28,038 --> 00:49:30,878
Don't worry too much.
It's a matter of time.

584
00:49:31,238 --> 00:49:34,538
I wanted to ask you
something about Cheol Soo.

585
00:49:34,838 --> 00:49:35,908
Sure.

586
00:49:54,538 --> 00:49:56,307
She fell down some stairs.

587
00:49:56,308 --> 00:49:58,708
I was so upset. Have a seat.

588
00:50:02,678 --> 00:50:04,938
How are you holding up?

589
00:50:05,878 --> 00:50:09,378
I'm on edge. I can barely control myself.

590
00:50:09,638 --> 00:50:11,438
By the time I got over it,

591
00:50:11,878 --> 00:50:15,638
I'd sent away my aunt and helper.

592
00:50:16,978 --> 00:50:18,208
Don't blame yourself.

593
00:50:18,878 --> 00:50:21,408
You just need some time to yourself.

594
00:50:23,038 --> 00:50:24,638
- Jeong Nam.
- What?

595
00:50:25,778 --> 00:50:27,078
Your left hand...

596
00:50:27,608 --> 00:50:30,077
You hurt it before you fought Cheol Soo.

597
00:50:30,078 --> 00:50:31,707
You said you fell.

598
00:50:31,708 --> 00:50:33,877
Why did you tell the reporter that...

599
00:50:33,878 --> 00:50:35,778
you got hurt during the fight?

600
00:50:38,008 --> 00:50:39,277
That evening,

601
00:50:39,278 --> 00:50:42,038
you went straight to the
terminal and found Cheol Soo.

602
00:50:42,208 --> 00:50:44,137
How did you recognize him?

603
00:50:44,138 --> 00:50:45,507
You'd never seen his face.

604
00:50:45,508 --> 00:50:49,438
You really are on edge.

605
00:50:54,138 --> 00:50:56,437
Reporters tend to exaggerate.

606
00:50:56,438 --> 00:50:58,008
It's a norm.

607
00:50:58,238 --> 00:50:59,478
I recognized him...

608
00:51:00,238 --> 00:51:02,708
because I had someone send me his photo.

609
00:51:04,908 --> 00:51:05,938
Happy now?

610
00:51:09,508 --> 00:51:11,438
I know you're scared,

611
00:51:11,938 --> 00:51:14,238
but you can't push me away, too.

612
00:51:15,278 --> 00:51:16,608
You'll be left with...

613
00:51:17,278 --> 00:51:18,838
no one on your side.

614
00:51:39,338 --> 00:51:40,538
Hi.

615
00:51:41,108 --> 00:51:44,178
You're Detective Gwon Jeong
Nam's daughter, right?

616
00:51:47,908 --> 00:51:51,478
Do you know who hurt your mom?

617
00:52:00,238 --> 00:52:01,878
If I tell you,

618
00:52:01,978 --> 00:52:05,878
can you save my mom?

619
00:52:08,308 --> 00:52:10,978
I know everything.

620
00:52:11,708 --> 00:52:16,208
You can't beat my dad.

621
00:52:24,638 --> 00:52:26,138
I can't go anywhere.

622
00:52:27,178 --> 00:52:29,008
I'm being tailed everywhere I go.

623
00:52:32,708 --> 00:52:35,178
Don't come anywhere near here for a while.

624
00:52:35,408 --> 00:52:37,208
Should I go to the police now?

625
00:52:37,808 --> 00:52:40,907
If I tell them that I've been framed,

626
00:52:40,908 --> 00:52:42,484
they may uncover the truth.

627
00:52:42,508 --> 00:52:44,278
Do you think you can beat that detective?

628
00:52:45,308 --> 00:52:47,307
Do you have money for a top-notched lawyer?

629
00:52:47,308 --> 00:52:50,508
What if it takes 10 or 20
years to clear your name?

630
00:52:51,178 --> 00:52:52,508
Are you ready for that?

631
00:52:55,608 --> 00:52:58,138
Why must I go through this?

632
00:52:58,408 --> 00:53:00,038
Why me?

633
00:53:00,838 --> 00:53:03,078
There's no reason for bad luck.

634
00:53:03,738 --> 00:53:05,908
You just happened to be there.

635
00:53:09,778 --> 00:53:11,678
What must I do?

636
00:53:12,408 --> 00:53:13,877
You have the money from Han Jin Ah, right?

637
00:53:13,878 --> 00:53:15,338
Hold onto it.

638
00:53:15,578 --> 00:53:17,278
You'll need it to leave the country.

639
00:53:18,538 --> 00:53:20,608
This call lasted too long. Bye.

640
00:54:01,378 --> 00:54:02,438
Hello?

641
00:54:02,638 --> 00:54:03,808
Captain.

642
00:54:05,678 --> 00:54:07,407
Hi, Mr. Kim.

643
00:54:07,408 --> 00:54:10,578
You got a new number so I
didn't know it was you.

644
00:54:11,338 --> 00:54:12,538
It wasn't me.

645
00:54:13,908 --> 00:54:15,008
I know.

646
00:54:20,438 --> 00:54:22,008
It really wasn't me.

647
00:54:22,238 --> 00:54:25,208
I never suspected you for a second.

648
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:29,877
Come on. You? Cheat on your wife?

649
00:54:29,878 --> 00:54:31,538
That's absurd.

650
00:54:37,208 --> 00:54:38,238
Captain.

651
00:54:39,108 --> 00:54:40,608
Are you well?

652
00:54:42,008 --> 00:54:44,478
You're not coughing up blood
and fainting, are you?

653
00:54:45,038 --> 00:54:47,708
Don't worry. Maybe it's because I'm old,

654
00:54:47,808 --> 00:54:49,508
but even the cancer cells are weak.

655
00:54:58,278 --> 00:54:59,338
Captain.

656
00:55:02,708 --> 00:55:05,078
I thought about...

657
00:55:06,508 --> 00:55:08,478
why this is happening to me.

658
00:55:11,238 --> 00:55:12,738
About 10 years ago,

659
00:55:14,878 --> 00:55:17,278
I sneaked into an empty
house in the woods...

660
00:55:18,678 --> 00:55:20,408
and stole from there.

661
00:55:21,308 --> 00:55:24,438
I was so excited that I didn't get caught.

662
00:55:25,678 --> 00:55:26,738
But...

663
00:55:29,908 --> 00:55:31,538
I think that sin...

664
00:55:34,078 --> 00:55:36,508
snowballed for 10 years...

665
00:55:36,938 --> 00:55:38,608
and pummeled me.

666
00:55:40,778 --> 00:55:42,508
I deserve it, then.

667
00:55:45,608 --> 00:55:47,038
That's why I'm frightened.

668
00:55:51,438 --> 00:55:52,538
That all of this...

669
00:55:53,778 --> 00:55:55,338
is my fault...

670
00:55:56,838 --> 00:55:57,908
Captain.

671
00:55:59,138 --> 00:56:00,338
Do you know something?

672
00:56:01,678 --> 00:56:04,378
You were the first person ever...

673
00:56:08,638 --> 00:56:11,338
to tell me that I did a good job.

674
00:56:16,608 --> 00:56:18,738
I never got to say this before, but...

675
00:56:23,138 --> 00:56:25,738
- thank you very, very...
- Mr. Kim.

676
00:56:27,108 --> 00:56:28,408
Don't give up.

677
00:56:29,338 --> 00:56:30,577
If you give up,

678
00:56:30,578 --> 00:56:31,907
you can't see anything.

679
00:56:31,908 --> 00:56:33,778
You can't even see things that are visible.

680
00:56:34,338 --> 00:56:37,508
There's a dense fog and it's dark.

681
00:56:38,108 --> 00:56:41,107
It's over 40°C. It's like an oven.

682
00:56:41,108 --> 00:56:42,507
Your body feels heavy...

683
00:56:42,508 --> 00:56:44,738
and you can't take a single step.

684
00:56:44,908 --> 00:56:47,237
The rescuer who should be there...

685
00:56:47,238 --> 00:56:48,638
is nowhere to be found.

686
00:56:49,678 --> 00:56:50,908
What will you do?

687
00:56:51,938 --> 00:56:53,478
Give up and leave?

688
00:56:57,008 --> 00:56:58,508
Will you give up and leave?

689
00:57:02,878 --> 00:57:03,878
No.

690
00:57:05,078 --> 00:57:07,038
I need to retrace my steps.

691
00:57:08,878 --> 00:57:10,708
He's there somewhere.

692
00:57:12,978 --> 00:57:15,408
As expected, you are so smart, Mr. Kim.

693
00:57:15,978 --> 00:57:19,308
Then take your time and look slowly.

694
00:57:19,578 --> 00:57:21,138
Did you miss anything?

695
00:57:37,178 --> 00:57:38,608
How did it go?

696
00:57:39,778 --> 00:57:43,138
The car owner is still
in Busan on business.

697
00:57:43,678 --> 00:57:45,178
He'll be back tomorrow.

698
00:57:46,278 --> 00:57:49,078
Okay. Keep up the good work.

699
00:57:49,938 --> 00:57:52,208
Don't lose sight of the car...

700
00:57:52,308 --> 00:57:54,178
until you get the dash cam video.

701
00:58:01,538 --> 00:58:04,108
Captain. There's something I need to do.

702
00:58:05,178 --> 00:58:06,838
Can I help?

703
00:58:07,338 --> 00:58:09,138
Don't die before I get back.

704
00:58:09,338 --> 00:58:11,938
I'll go back and get you your surgery.

705
00:58:14,738 --> 00:58:17,238
Okay. I'll wait.

706
00:58:51,938 --> 00:58:53,178
I got you.

707
00:58:57,008 --> 00:58:59,308
You got caught too easily
for a fugitive on the run,

708
00:59:00,478 --> 00:59:01,708
Kang Cheol Soo.

709
00:59:14,578 --> 00:59:20,508
(Tune in for the finale.)

710
00:59:35,578 --> 00:59:38,338
(Naked Fireman)

711
00:59:38,738 --> 00:59:40,177
I can't trust Cheol Soo.

712
00:59:40,178 --> 00:59:42,177
If he's innocent, he shouldn't run.

713
00:59:42,178 --> 00:59:44,377
The police fabricated evidence...

714
00:59:44,378 --> 00:59:46,207
and is trying to frame him.

715
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:48,307
Are you with Jin Ah?

716
00:59:48,308 --> 00:59:49,878
Jin Ah and Cheol Soo?

717
00:59:50,678 --> 00:59:52,138
It's my first time ever...

718
00:59:52,238 --> 00:59:54,578
being protected by someone so small.

719
00:59:54,838 --> 00:59:55,937
Things fell through.

720
00:59:55,938 --> 00:59:58,077
You need to get the dash cam video somehow.

721
00:59:58,078 --> 01:00:00,307
I'm being watched by cops right now.

722
01:00:00,308 --> 01:00:02,808
How can I do that with a tail on me?

723
01:00:02,908 --> 01:00:05,077
Just because I can't
trust Detective Gwon...

724
01:00:05,078 --> 01:00:06,907
doesn't mean I trust you.

725
01:00:06,908 --> 01:00:08,837
Ever since you found out my real name,

726
01:00:08,838 --> 01:00:10,277
I haven't lied to you once.

727
01:00:10,278 --> 01:00:12,037
You must believe it without a doubt now...

728
01:00:12,038 --> 01:00:16,737
that Kang Cheol Soo is the
one who killed your parents.

729
01:00:16,738 --> 01:00:18,137
That's absurd.

730
01:00:18,138 --> 01:00:19,837
He killed my parents,

731
01:00:19,838 --> 01:00:23,537
and if that wasn't enough,
he lied to me for 10 years?

732
01:00:23,538 --> 01:00:25,107
You came to me...

733
01:00:25,108 --> 01:00:26,437
because you didn't trust him.

734
01:00:26,438 --> 01:00:29,438
In order to find out the
truth that you sensed.
