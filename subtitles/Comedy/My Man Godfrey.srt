1
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,873
Hello, Duke.

2
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,975
Hello, Mike.
Any luck today?

3
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:00,986
I figured out a swell racket,

4
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:03,454
and everything was going great
until the cops came along.

5
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:05,457
Too bad it didn't work.

6
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:07,823
<i>If them cops would stick
to their own racket,</i>

7
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:09,828
<i>we'd get somewhere
in this country...</i>

8
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:12,262
<i>without a lot of this
relief and all that stuff.</i>

9
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:16,393
Mike, I wouldn't worry.
Prosperity's just around the corner.

10
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:20,929
Yeah. It's been there a long time.
I wish I knew which corner.

11
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:23,567
Well, Duke, I'm gonna turn in.

12
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:26,043
<i>- Bonsoir.
- Bonsoir, Mike.</i>

13
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:39,658
This is the place, all right.
That looks like one of them.

14
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:42,661
- Looks pretty tough to me.
- Stall Irene. I'll talk to the fellow.

15
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:45,425
- I told you about this place.
- We got here first.

16
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,659
Well, she's not gonna
get ahead of me.

17
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,403
Good evening.

18
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:56,708
- Good evening.
- How'd you like to make five dollars?

19
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:59,609
Huh? I didn't quite
catch what you said.

20
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,874
I said, how'd you like
to make five dollars?

21
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:04,348
<i>- Five dollars?
- Five dollars.</i>

22
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:07,443
Well, I don't want
to seem inquisitive,

23
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,613
but what would I
have to do for it?

24
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:12,283
All you have to do is go
to the Waldorf Ritz Hotel with me,

25
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:15,293
I'll show you to a few people,
and then I'll send you right back.

26
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,295
May I inquire just why
you would want...

27
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,354
to show me to people
at the Waldorf Ritz?

28
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:22,367
Oh, if you must know,
it's a game... a scavenger hunt.

29
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:26,701
If I find a forgotten man first, I win.
Is that clear?

30
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:28,832
Yes, quite clear.

31
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:32,639
Shall I wear my tails,
or come just as I am?

32
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:36,045
You needn't be fresh. Do you want
the five dollars or don't you?

33
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:38,640
Madam, I can't tell you
how flattered I am...

34
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,652
by your very generous offer.

35
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,212
However, I'll have to take it up
with my board of directors.

36
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:47,384
- Don't you touch me!
- No matter what my directors advise,

37
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,758
- I think you should be spanked.
- George, do something!

38
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:51,956
Are you in the habit
of hitting ladies?

39
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:55,023
I'm in the habit of hitting gentlemen
also, if that'll interest you.

40
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:58,002
- Aren't you going to do anything?
- Let's get a policeman.

41
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:03,168
- Who are you?
- I'm Irene.

42
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,837
That was my sister Cornelia
you pushed in the ash pile.

43
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,506
- Like me to push Cornelia's sister?
- I don't think I'd like that.

44
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,606
- Then you'd better get out of here.
- Oh, you bet.

45
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:12,617
Wait a minute!
Sit down!

46
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:14,619
I'm sitting.

47
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:17,451
What's up, Duke?
Need some help?

48
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:20,617
No, thanks, boys.
Got everything under control.

49
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:23,059
Are you a member
of this hunting party?

50
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:25,927
I was, but I'm not now.
Are they all forgotten men too?

51
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:28,092
Yes, I guess they are, maybe. Why?

52
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:31,728
I couldn't help but laugh. I've wanted
to do that since I was six years old.

53
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:35,240
- You wanted to what?
- Oh, push Cornelia in a pile of ashes.

54
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:38,243
That was Faithful George with her.
That isn't really his name.

55
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:41,712
He gets in everybody's hair.
His father's the broker.

56
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,749
That's very enlightening.

57
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:46,751
Cornelia thought she was going to win,
and you pushed her.

58
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:54,759
Could follow an intelligent conversation
for just a moment?

59
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:57,125
- I'll try.
- Well, that's fine.

60
00:04:57,196 --> 00:05:00,131
Do you mind telling me
just what a scavenger hunt is?

61
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:02,895
Well, a scavenger hunt
is exactly like a treasure hunt.

62
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,563
In a treasure hunt
you try to find something you want.

63
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:08,573
In a scavenger hunt you try to find
something that nobody wants.

64
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,939
- Hmm, like a forgotten man?
- That's right.

65
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,774
The one that wins gets a prize,
only there really is no prize.

66
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:16,781
It's just the honor of winning.
The money goes to charity.

67
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:19,784
That is, if there's any money left over,
and there never is.

68
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:22,719
Well, that clears
the whole matter up beautifully.

69
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:26,589
I've decided I don't want to play any
more games with human beings as objects.

70
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:29,856
It's kind of sordid when you think
of it, when you think it over.

71
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:33,126
Yeah, well, I don't know.
I haven't thought it over.

72
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,635
I don't like to change the subject, but
why do you live in a place like this?

73
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:38,967
There's so many
other nice places.

74
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:42,166
- You really want to know?
- Oh, I'm very curious.

75
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:47,178
Because my real estate agent felt the
altitude would be good for my asthma.

76
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:50,238
- Oh, my uncle has asthma.
- No!

77
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:53,046
Well, now there's a coincidence.

78
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:55,952
Well, I suppose I should
be going now, shouldn't I?

79
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,956
That's a good idea.

80
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:01,050
I want to see who won the game.
I suppose it was Cornelia.

81
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:03,527
She probably got another
forgotten man by now.

82
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:06,656
If you took me with you,
you'd win the game? Is that the idea?

83
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:08,860
Well, I might if I got there first.

84
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:11,802
But after seeing what you did
to Cornelia, I'm not saying anything.

85
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,465
But you'd win if you
got back first with me?

86
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,306
It'd be awfully nice of you,
but I don't like to ask.

87
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,573
Let's beat Cornelia.

88
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:23,581
- It wouldn't be asking too much?
- Mm-mm.

89
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:26,846
See, I've got a sense of curiosity,
just the same as you have.

90
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:30,082
I'd really like to see
just what a scavenger hunt looks like.

91
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:34,092
- But I told you!
- Yes. I'm still curious.

92
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,890
Well, come on.

93
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:44,425
<i>Thank you.</i>

94
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:47,667
- My name's Blake.
- My name is Bullock.

95
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,800
The place slightly resembles
an insane asylum.

96
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:53,107
Well, all you need
to start an asylum...

97
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:55,443
is an empty room and
the right kind of people.

98
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:57,449
That's right.

99
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:04,085
Oh, good evening, Mrs. Jordan.
Look what I brought with me.

100
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:06,284
Oh, why, look!

101
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:08,759
- And the baby came along too!
- Here.

102
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:14,061
Take a look at the dizzy
old gal with the goat.

103
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:17,466
I've had to look at her for 20 years.
That's Mrs. Bullock.

104
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:19,129
Alexander!

105
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:21,571
- Alexander! Alexander!
- I'm terribly sorry.

106
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:24,633
How do you think I feel?
All right, Angelica!

107
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:28,043
Alexander, Alexander, come here.
Look at the pretty goat.

108
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,606
Carlo and I found him in the Bronx.
Isn't he just sweet?

109
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:34,949
- He doesn't smell very sweet.
- Oh, Alexander never did like animals.

110
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:37,319
Come on, goat, goat, goat.
Come on. Come on.

111
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,881
- Are you talking to me or that thing?
- Oh, Alexander!

112
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:43,759
Don't be afraid of the stairs. Angelica
won't let anything happen to you.

113
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,298
Quick, quick, quick.
Come on. Quick, quick.

114
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:48,765
Come on, goat, goat, goat.
Come on.

115
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:55,701
I have a goat!
I have a goat!

116
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:58,403
I have a goat!

117
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,641
Will you please
pay attention to me?

118
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:04,444
I'm Mrs. Bullock,
and I have a goat.

119
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:07,611
<i>I have a goat!
I have a goat!</i>

120
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:10,850
I have a goat!
I have a goat!

121
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:14,984
I know you've got a goat. Will you
please get Mrs. Bullock's goat?

122
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:17,757
Get those things
out of the way.

123
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:24,364
I have a little baby goat.

124
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:27,600
What am I supposed
to do with that?

125
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,698
- What else do we have to find?
- What?

126
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:32,266
What else do we have to get?

127
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,712
All you have to get is one forgotten man
and a bowl ofJapanese goldfish.

128
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:38,682
What? Get that thing
out of the way! What?

129
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:41,720
I said, a forgotten man
and a bowl ofJapanese goldfish.

130
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:45,279
One man... Let's go.

131
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,553
AJapanese man.

132
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:50,926
A man and a bowl
ofJapanese men.

133
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:53,830
- I can't remember what he said.
- How about going home?

134
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,767
- What are you talking about?
- How about going home?

135
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:59,361
We just have
two other things to get.

136
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:01,770
A bowl ofJapanese men
and a forgotten goldfish.

137
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:05,299
- Goldfish!
- I don't know about the goldfish!

138
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:09,610
But if you want a forgotten man,
you'll find me home in bed!

139
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:12,845
I can't concentrate, Alexander.
Come along, Carlo. Goldfish...

140
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:17,655
- Are all these people hunters?
- Oh, no, we work in groups.

141
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,918
Some are hunters,
and some are receivers.

142
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:22,756
- Sounds like a bankruptcy proceeding.
- I never thought of that.

143
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:25,160
- Who receives me?
- I have to take you to the committee.

144
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,665
- You don't mind, do you?
- I can hardly wait.

145
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,860
Wait a minute!
What have you there?

146
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:32,666
This is Godfrey.
Is Cornelia back yet?

147
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:35,172
I haven't seen Cornelia.
Where did you find him?

148
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:42,072
Oh, Mr. Guthrie!
Come on this way.

149
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:45,584
Mr. Guthrie!
Mr. Guthrie!

150
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:49,087
I have a forgotten man.

151
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:52,989
I have a forgotten man!
Mr. Guthrie, this is Godfrey.

152
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:55,357
He's a forgotten man!
Mr. Guthrie!

153
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,555
- A forgotten man!
- His name is Godfrey.

154
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,860
- A forgotten man? You got all eight.
- Yes.

155
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,196
Ladies and gentlemen,
please, quiet, quiet.

156
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,202
Miss Bullock has a forgotten man.

157
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,397
Do you mind stepping up
on the platform, please.

158
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:09,703
Yes, get right up
on the platform, Godfrey.

159
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:13,643
- Mind if I ask you a few questions?
- Fire away.

160
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:17,809
- What is your address?
- City Dump 32, East River, Sutton Place.

161
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:20,977
<i>- It's rather fashionable over there.
- In spots.</i>

162
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:24,454
- Is that your permanent address?
- The permanency is questionable.

163
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:27,424
See, the place is being
rapidly filled in.

164
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:31,554
- Mind if I ask a personal question?
- If it isn't too personal.

165
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,725
- Are those whiskers your own?
- No one else has claimed them.

166
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,462
I must ask that question
because one group...

167
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:41,597
tried to fool the committee by trying to
put false whiskers on one of their own.

168
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:45,508
- May I, uh... May I, uh...
- What?

169
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:47,739
Oh, it's a pleasure.

170
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:50,577
One more question.
Are you wanted by the police?

171
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,244
Ah, that's just the trouble.
Nobody wants me.

172
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,947
<i>- Oh, very good answer.
- Splendid, Godfrey.</i>

173
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:58,388
You mean, nobody wants him?
Nobody at all?

174
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:00,516
- Nobody.
- Oh, that's too bad.

175
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:03,528
On the contrary,
I sometimes find it a great advantage.

176
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:05,530
The committee is satisfied.
Miss Irene Bullock...

177
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:07,532
wins 20 points
for a forgotten man...

178
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,330
and 50 points extra
for bringing in the first one.

179
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:12,769
<i>- Oh, bravo!
- Speech! Speech!</i>

180
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,363
Group ten...

181
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:18,433
<i>- Speech! Speech!
- Group ten wins the silver cup.</i>

182
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,877
<i>- Oh, thank you.
- Speech! Speech!</i>

183
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:23,346
<i>- They want a speech. Come on!
- Speech!</i>

184
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:30,546
My purpose in coming here
tonight was twofold.

185
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:33,592
Firstly, I wanted
to aid this young lady.

186
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:35,593
Secondly, I was curious to see...

187
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:38,562
how a bunch empty-headed nitwits
conducted themselves.

188
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:41,031
My curiosity is satisfied.

189
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,762
I assure you it will be
a pleasure for me...

190
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:47,203
to go back to a society
of really important people.

191
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:49,298
- What did he call us?
- Nitwits.

192
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,208
- Nitwits? What are they?
- I don't know.

193
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:54,212
<i>The man's perfect!</i>

194
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,147
<i>I've been wanting to say that,
but I didn't have the nerve.</i>

195
00:11:57,216 --> 00:12:00,413
<i>Oh, Godfrey!
Oh, Godfrey!</i>

196
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:03,011
Oh, Godfrey,
I'm terribly sorry.

197
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:06,081
- That's all right.
- I'd never brought you here.

198
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:10,094
This is the first time I've ever beaten
Cornelia, and you helped me do it.

199
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:12,687
Well, that makes me
a Cornelia beater, doesn't it?

200
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:15,700
You've done something for me.
I wish I could do something for you.

201
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:19,260
- Why?
- Because you've done something for me.

202
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:22,899
No, I don't see. But I could use a job,
if you've got one.

203
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:25,000
- Can you "buttle"?
- "Buttle"?

204
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,545
We're fresh out of butlers.
The one we had left this morning.

205
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:30,377
<i>Irene, they're calling for you
in the jade room.</i>

206
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:33,384
- Don't you want your cup?
- Tell them to keep their cup.

207
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:36,114
You can't talk to this man.
What will people think?

208
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:39,021
I don't care what they think.
Godfrey's gonna be our butler.

209
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,787
- He's gonna be whose butler?
- He's gonna work for us.

210
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:43,795
Oh, that's ridiculous.
You don't know anything about him.

211
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:45,797
He hasn't any recommendations...

212
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:47,799
The last one had recommendations
and stole all the silver.

213
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:49,801
That was merely a coincidence.

214
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:52,702
People that take in stray cats
say they make the best pets.

215
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,206
I don't see what cats
have got to do with butlers.

216
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:58,038
You mustn't pay any attention
to my daughter. She's very impulsive.

217
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,101
- I'm not impulsive!
- Don't shout at your mother.

218
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:03,205
- I will shout!
- Oh, Mrs. Meriwether, Irene is shouting.

219
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:07,378
- You mean it's all over?
- Yes, she always shouts when she wins.

220
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:11,947
Run along, my good man. Thank you so
much for coming. Thank you so, so much.

221
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:14,254
<i>He will not run along!</i>

222
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:17,489
<i>I think I'd better.</i>

223
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:20,964
My word! There's Cornelia,
and she has another one!

224
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:27,737
You're a little late, Cornelia.
I've won the game.

225
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,935
- Oh, you have?
- Where do I get my five bucks?

226
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,410
Bucks? What...
Will you talk to your sister?

227
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,879
<i>She wants to hire this man
as a butler.</i>

228
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:39,008
Why not? He might make
a very good butler.

229
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:41,678
I'm sure I'd make
a very good butler.

230
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:43,915
Hey, where do I get
my five bucks?

231
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:47,481
Bucks? Bucks? What's he talking
about? What's he talking about?

232
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,495
- Five bucks!
- I promised him five dollars.

233
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:53,862
Well, give him the five dollars and the
bucks too, and get him out of here...

234
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:56,128
before your sister
hires him as a chauffeur.

235
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:59,137
Why did I have to find out
there's insanity on your father's side?

236
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:01,139
Come along, Cornelia.

237
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:04,643
I hope, Godfrey,
that you're very good at shining shoes.

238
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:07,804
I think we'd better drop
the whole idea, don't you?

239
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:11,179
I should say not. You're gonna make
the best butler we ever had.

240
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,481
And here. You'll need
some clothes and things, you know.

241
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:17,147
Oh, well, I...

242
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:24,629
I told G. To lay out my other coat.

243
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:28,360
You have a wonderful sense of humor.

244
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:30,368
Thank you.

245
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:33,200
Well, then... good night.

246
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:36,139
Oh, uh, just one question.

247
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,142
- What?
- Where do you live?

248
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:41,077
Oh, 1011 Fifth.
Funny, I never thought of that.

249
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:43,637
- No, you didn't.
- No.

250
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:47,152
1011 Fifth.
Well, good night again.

251
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,653
Good night, Godfrey.

252
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:08,403
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

253
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:11,671
- I'm the new, uh...
- Yes, I know. You're the new butler.

254
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:15,339
- How did you know?
- There's one every day at this hour.

255
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,780
They're dropping in and out
all the time.

256
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,784
Why is that?

257
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:22,685
Some get fired,
some quit.

258
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:26,020
- Is the family that exacting?
- No, they're that nutty.

259
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,626
- May I be frank?
- Is that your name?

260
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:33,256
- No, my name is Godfrey.
- All right, be frank.

261
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:36,768
You're, uh,
quite an enthusiast.

262
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:39,929
Don't you worry about me.
I'm a seasoned campaigner.

263
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:43,065
Uh, may we be friends?

264
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:46,339
Oh, I'm friends
with all the butlers. Sit down.

265
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:50,041
What's a three-letter sea bird
with an "R" in the middle?

266
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:53,448
That's... Oh, I...
I don't know.

267
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,647
You're no help.
Where'd you get the trick suit?

268
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:58,656
What's the matter with it?

269
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:02,660
Well, it might look better
if you took the rental tag off the coat.

270
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:05,663
Oh... thanks.

271
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:08,859
Does the butler have quarters here
in the house, or is that necessary?

272
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:11,164
Oh, you won't need any quarters.
Hang your hat near the door...

273
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:13,170
so you can get it quickly
on the way out.

274
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:15,365
What's that?

275
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:18,535
That's the old battle axe.
She usually rings about this time.

276
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:21,602
- The old battle axe?
- Mrs. Bullock. She's the mother type.

277
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,843
- Well, don't you do anything about it?
- Mrs. Bullock or the buzzer?

278
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:26,908
- The buzzer.
- Not the first time.

279
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:31,047
If she has a hangover, she'll ring again
in a minute in no uncertain terms.

280
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:34,456
Then, brother, you better
grab her tomato juice and get going.

281
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:37,552
<i>Ah, there she blows.</i>

282
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,830
Well, Cupid, this is
your big opportunity.

283
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,834
Shall I take it to her?

284
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:46,063
You might as well
know the worst.

285
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:48,265
- I want to warn you, she sees pixies.
- Pixies?

286
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,207
- You know, the little men.
- Oh, those.

287
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:54,211
I know how to take care of those.
Have you any Worcestershire?

288
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:56,304
What are you
gonna do with that?

289
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:58,612
Do unto others as you would
have others do unto you.

290
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,914
What do you want to do?
Scorch her windpipe?

291
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:03,921
There's nothing like a counterirritant.
Where do I find her?

292
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:06,116
You better go this way.
It's quicker.

293
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,125
The upper landing,
to the left.

294
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:20,170
- Just which is her...
- That's her cage up there, first door.

295
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:23,174
- Oh. Wish me luck.
- Happy landing.

296
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:03,839
What day is it, Molly?

297
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,316
- I'm not Molly.
- Who isn't?

298
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:08,319
I'm not.

299
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:11,356
Stop jumping up and down,
so I can see who you are.

300
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,891
- I'm not jumping.
- That's better.

301
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:16,393
- What's your name?
- Godfrey.

302
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:18,487
Are you someone I know?

303
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:21,192
We met last night
at the Waldorf Ritz.

304
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:24,702
Oh, yes, you were
with Mrs. Maxton's party at the bar.

305
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,704
Or were you?

306
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,036
I'm the forgotten man.

307
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,906
So many people
have such bad memories.

308
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:33,911
That's so true.

309
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:38,439
Why do they keep playing
that same tune over and over again?

310
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:40,451
Why do they?

311
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:43,215
Don't you hear it?

312
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:50,052
Oh... yes, yes, I do,
in a way.

313
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:54,156
Always the same tune
over and over again.

314
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:56,394
May I, uh...

315
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:59,631
May you what?
Where are you?

316
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:01,866
What's that?

317
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,965
Pixie remover.

318
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:06,567
Oh. Then you see them too.

319
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,476
We're old friends.

320
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:10,606
Yes, but you mustn't
step on them.

321
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:14,243
I don't like them, but I don't like
to see them stepped on.

322
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:17,618
I'll be very careful.
I wouldn't hurt them for the world.

323
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:20,283
<i>- What am I supposed to do with this?
- Drink it.</i>

324
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:23,021
And they'll go away very quickly.

325
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:25,427
Very, very quickly.

326
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,129
You must never be rough with them.
You must always send them away quietly.

327
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:39,833
- Is that better?
- Yes. You're a great help.

328
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:42,676
Go away, little men.
Go away. Shh, shh, shh.

329
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:46,514
Oh, but... Oh, you haven't
told me who you are.

330
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:50,521
I'm Godfrey, the forgotten man.
I'm the new butler.

331
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:53,615
- Are you that ugly man with the beard?
- The same.

332
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,456
Oh, you've changed.
I should never have known you.

333
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:59,190
- Thank you.
- You're very comforting.

334
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:01,732
I hope I'll see more of you.

335
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,668
Maybe I'd better not drink any more
of this, or you might go away too.

336
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,948
I put your hat
at the foot of the stairs.

337
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,954
You can go out
the front way.

338
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:26,957
- I think I won the first round.
- You're still working here?

339
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:29,994
- Haven't heard anything to the contrary.
- You just got by the cub.

340
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,155
- Try the lioness.
- Oh, which is she?

341
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:35,496
Her name's Cornelia.
She's a sweet-tempered little number.

342
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:38,161
- Yes, I met her last night.
- You've got a treat coming.

343
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,172
You never met her in the morning.
Second door.

344
00:20:57,656 --> 00:21:02,093
<i>Who are you,
and what are you doing in here?</i>

345
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,857
<i>Get out! I don't want
a hobo serving my breakfast!</i>

346
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:09,423
<i>Don't ever come here again,
if you know what's good for you.</i>

347
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:11,867
I'm afraid I lost
the second round.

348
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,371
<i>Hey, I want the new butler
to bring me breakfast!</i>

349
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:17,704
Opportunity never stops knocking
in this house. Want to try again?

350
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:21,610
- How is she in the morning?
- Not as violent, but more insidious.

351
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,614
Here goes.

352
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:27,618
<i>I'll leave your things right up here,
so you won't forget them.</i>

353
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,828
Good morning.
I brought your breakfast.

354
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:40,831
A- Are you the new butler?

355
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:44,665
- Don't you remember last night?
- What happened to Godfrey?

356
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:47,170
- I'm Godfrey.
- Oh, you look so different.

357
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:50,333
What happened
to those nice whiskers?

358
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:53,037
Turn around.
Let me look at you.

359
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:55,375
You're the cutest thing
I've ever seen.

360
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:57,415
Thank you.
Will there be anything else?

361
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:00,713
Yes. Sit down and talk to me.
I like to talk in the morning...

362
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:03,084
especially if you've been
somewhere the night before.

363
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,589
Don't you think it'd be better
if I talked standing?

364
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,591
No. If you're uncomfortable,
I get uncomfortable,

365
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,786
I get uncomfortable and forget
what I have to say.

366
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:11,795
If you insist.

367
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:14,297
But it doesn't seem in very
good form for a butler.

368
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:17,665
Oh, you're more than a butler.
You're the first protege I ever had.

369
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:19,795
- Protege?
- You know, like Carlo.

370
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:22,840
- Who is Carlo?
- He's Mother's protege!

371
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:26,503
You know, it's awfully nice
Carlo having a sponsor,

372
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:29,570
because he doesn't have to work and
he gets more time for his practicing.

373
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:32,674
- And that makes a difference.
- Yes, I imagine it would.

374
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:36,118
Do you play anything?
Oh, I don't mean games.

375
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,418
- I mean the piano and things like that.
- Well, I...

376
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,617
It doesn't really
make any difference.

377
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,626
It's funny how some things
make you think of other things.

378
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,628
Yes, very peculiar.

379
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:48,826
- Makes me feel so mature and grown up.
- What does?

380
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,664
Having a protege.
You're the first one I ever had.

381
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:54,934
- You've never had others?
- You're the first, and it's thrilling.

382
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:58,237
Not only does it occupy my mind,
but it's character-building too.

383
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:02,406
Mm-hmm. Just what
does a protege have to do?

384
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:05,678
Well, you just go on buttling,
and I sponsor you. Don't you see?

385
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:08,151
Yeah, it's getting clearer.

386
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,485
It's really not much work,
and it's gonna be such fun.

387
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:14,491
I'm sure it's going
to be heaps of fun.

388
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,824
For instance, if Cornelia got mean, you
wouldn't have to do anything about it.

389
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,660
I'm your sponsor,
and I'd just take a sock at her.

390
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,666
I hope that'll
never be necessary.

391
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,827
I just wanted
to give you the idea.

392
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:28,339
That's fine, but a protege
has certain responsibilities also.

393
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:31,843
For instance, if someone should ring
for me now and I didn't answer,

394
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,344
that would reflect upon you
because you're my sponsor.

395
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:37,348
- Don't you see?
- Yes, I never thought of that.

396
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:40,351
You don't know how nice it is having
some intelligent person to talk to.

397
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,546
It's been very enlightening
to me too.

398
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:45,055
Oh, I just thought of something.
Do you know what you are?

399
00:23:45,123 --> 00:23:48,354
- I'm not quite sure.
- You're my responsibility.

400
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:51,396
- That's very nice.
- See you in church.

401
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,603
Good morning.
Fine morning, sir.

402
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:12,172
Yes, it is a fine morning.

403
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:20,750
Don't be in a hurry.

404
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:23,226
You see,
I'm the old-fashioned type.

405
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:26,423
And I was also middleweight champion
when I was in college.

406
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:29,524
I thought you might like to know that
before this thing starts.

407
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:31,728
Well, you see, sir,
I'm the new butler.

408
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,737
I just served Miss Irene
her breakfast.

409
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,899
Do you always take a change of wardrobe
when you serve breakfast?

410
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,409
Well... I think
this young lady can explain.

411
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,742
He really is the new butler,
Mr. Bullock.

412
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:44,213
I can't imagine how his things
got in the hallway.

413
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:47,649
I still don't get it. But if you are
the new butler, why didn't you say so?

414
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:49,846
I'm very sorry, sir.
May I?

415
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:52,913
There's a man at the door to see you.
I think it's another process server.

416
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,925
- Another one?
- Yes, sir.

417
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:00,590
Well, here I am again
with another little present...

418
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:03,759
Yes, I've heard that before. Which one
of the family is it this time?

419
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:07,999
Miss Cornelia. Last night, she busted
up a few windows along Fifth Avenue.

420
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:11,839
- I'm sorry, but girls will be girls.
- Good-bye.

421
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:14,845
In this family,
it's one subpoena after another.

422
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:18,747
Mr. Bullock, there's a handsome
cab driver waiting in the kitchen.

423
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:22,218
- What's he want?
- He wants $50 and his horse.

424
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:24,221
What horse?

425
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:27,417
The one Miss Irene rode
up the front steps last night.

426
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:29,824
Where is his horse?
I haven't got it.

427
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:32,989
It's in the library,
where Miss Irene left it.

428
00:25:45,443 --> 00:25:48,071
Well, do you begin
to get the idea?

429
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:20,139
Come here, my man.

430
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:26,517
Do you like your place here,
so far as you've gone?

431
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,519
I find it very entertaining.

432
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:31,055
Yes, we are a very
entertaining family.

433
00:26:31,122 --> 00:26:33,352
You really think you're
going to like it here?

434
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:37,521
I must admit it's more desirable than
living in a packing case on a city dump.

435
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,156
Oh, that's where I met you,
isn't it?

436
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:43,894
- Yes, miss.
- Oh, yes, yes. I remember now.

437
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:47,234
We were playing some sort of a game...
a scavenger hunt, I think.

438
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:51,765
<i>We needed a forgotten man. I asked you
to go to the Waldorf Ritz Hotel with me,</i>

439
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:55,472
and I'm a little bit hazy as to
just what happened after that.

440
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:58,812
- I pushed you into an ash pile.
- Oh, yes, of course you did.

441
00:26:58,883 --> 00:27:02,614
It was very amusing.
They were nice, clean ashes.

442
00:27:02,687 --> 00:27:05,554
- I'm very sorry, miss.
- I didn't mind at all.

443
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:08,718
It was very amusing.
Have you a handkerchief?

444
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:13,059
<i>There's a spot on my shoe.
Would you see what you can do about it?</i>

445
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:23,574
I could have you fired, you know?
But I like to see things wriggle.

446
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,769
When I get through with you,

447
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:28,642
you'll go back to your packing case
on the city dump and relish it.

448
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:32,171
People don't make a practice of pushing
Cornelia Bullock into ash piles.

449
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:35,151
<i>I'll make your life so miser...</i>

450
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:41,382
- Hello, Godfrey.
- Greetings, Irene.

451
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:43,950
- I like your new monkey suit.
- Thank you for picking it up.

452
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:47,465
- It fits very well for a hand-me-down.
- I'm more or less standard.

453
00:27:47,532 --> 00:27:49,693
How do you like
my new pajamas?

454
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:52,635
I think they're very nice.
Thank you.

455
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:58,437
- I heard what you said to Godfrey.
- So what?

456
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,911
- So you leave him alone!
- Who's gonna make me leave him alone?

457
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,778
If you don't,
you'll get a good sock from me.

458
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,942
- Oh, the physical type.
- What I say goes.

459
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:09,213
Since when did you start
falling in love with butlers?

460
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:11,812
I'm not in love with him.
He's my protege.

461
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:15,189
Oh, your protege. That's why
you're picking out his suits for him.

462
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:18,593
Suppose Father hears about this. How
long do you think Godfrey will last?

463
00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:20,858
Father isn't
going to hear about it.

464
00:28:20,932 --> 00:28:23,196
You seem terribly sure
of everything.

465
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:25,259
If Father hears about Godfrey,

466
00:28:25,336 --> 00:28:27,566
he's also going to hear about you
and that college boy.

467
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:29,869
I don't know
what you're talking about.

468
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:34,139
But if Father does hear about it, I'm
likely to do a little socking myself.

469
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:39,013
Little Red Riding Hood didn't have
enough charm to trap a wolf her own age,

470
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:42,986
so she falls in love with the butler
and lives happily ever after.

471
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:45,716
- If you know what I mean.
- I know, if you know what I mean.

472
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:48,315
- May I come in?
- You're in, aren't you?

473
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:51,556
<i>Very interesting book.
The Greeks of the Middle Ages.</i>

474
00:28:51,629 --> 00:28:55,258
Oh, Irene would like that. You love
the Middle Ages, don't you, dear?

475
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:02,271
Ahh.

476
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,831
Oh, Carlo!
Who's giving the concert tonight?

477
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:07,309
- The great Kalininski.
- Oh, the pianist?

478
00:29:07,378 --> 00:29:10,711
- No, cellist.
- What difference does it make?

479
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:14,183
Oh, it's so nice to see you two girls
having a pleasant chat.

480
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:16,482
Or is it a pleasant chat?

481
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:21,617
Well, well, well! Imagine the Bullocks
gathered together in one room.

482
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:25,459
- Don't forget Carlo.
- I'm not going to forget Carlo.

483
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:28,055
Don't bother about me.
I feel like one of the family.

484
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:30,624
Don't you go away.

485
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:34,331
You don't mind if I discuss a few family
matters, do you, Carlo, old boy?

486
00:29:34,405 --> 00:29:36,566
- No, not at all.
- Oh, Alexander,

487
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:40,634
you're not going to bring up those
sordid business matters, I hope.

488
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:43,010
I've just been going over
last month's bills,

489
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:45,777
and you people have confused me
with the Treasury Department.

490
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:47,943
Don't start that again, Dad.

491
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:51,113
I don't mind giving the government
60% of what I make.

492
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:54,022
But I can't do it
when my family spends 50%!

493
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:56,993
Well, why should the government
get more money than your own family?

494
00:29:57,061 --> 00:30:01,555
That's what I want to know.
Why should the government get more?

495
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,295
Well, that's just the way
they have of doing things.

496
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:07,270
Oh! Money, money, money!

497
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:10,739
The Frankenstein monster
that destroys souls!

498
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:14,643
Please don't say anything more
about it! You're upsetting Carlo!

499
00:30:14,712 --> 00:30:17,476
We've got to come
to an understanding right now!

500
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:19,915
- Either Carlo is or I am.
- Am what?

501
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:23,044
Well, one of us has got to,
and that's all there is to it.

502
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:26,147
You're inebriated. You don't know
what you're talking about.

503
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:30,092
Who would know what they're talking
about, living with a bunch like this?

504
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:33,653
There's one thing I do know.
What this family needs is discipline.

505
00:30:33,731 --> 00:30:35,926
I've been a pretty patient man.

506
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,594
But when people start riding
horses up the front steps...

507
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:42,128
and parking them in the library,
that's going a bit too far.

508
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:47,042
- Horses?
- Are you insinuating I rode a horse?

509
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:49,909
Maybe that wasn't a horse
I saw in the library.

510
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:53,712
I'm positive I didn't ride a horse.
I didn't have my riding costume on.

511
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:57,221
- Irene rode the horse up the steps.
- What horse?

512
00:30:57,288 --> 00:30:59,779
Don't play innocent.
I begged you not to do it.

513
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:03,089
I didn't ride a horse!
But if I did ride a horse,

514
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:07,393
who broke those windows
on Fifth Avenue?

515
00:31:07,465 --> 00:31:09,524
- What windows?
- You know what windows!

516
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:12,229
And how about that college sap?
Yah, yah, yah!

517
00:31:12,303 --> 00:31:16,330
I don't care who broke the horse,
rode the window or yah, yah, yah'ed.

518
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:20,138
But this family's got to settle down!

519
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:22,702
Will you stop bellowing!
Look what you're doing to Carlo.

520
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:25,146
<i>- Hang Carlo!
- Ohhh!</i>

521
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:28,481
<i>You've exhausted my patience!
- Did you make these?</i>

522
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:31,021
- I helped.
- They must be wonderful.

523
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:33,717
- I'd like to help, if you'll let me.
- I'd feel honored.

524
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:37,386
<i>You might as well face the situation.
I've lost a lot of money.</i>

525
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:39,396
<i>- You have?
- Yes, I have.</i>

526
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:41,694
Maybe you left it
in your other suit.

527
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:44,758
If things keep on, it won't be long
till I don't have another suit.

528
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:47,202
Which ones are poisoned?

529
00:31:47,272 --> 00:31:49,206
Thank you.

530
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:54,174
While we're on the subject, how about
this business of certain people...

531
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:57,271
picking up anybody they find on the city
dump and dragging them into the house?

532
00:31:57,348 --> 00:32:01,341
<i>- We might all be stabbed and robbed.
- Who's going to stab who?</i>

533
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,910
We don't know a thing
about certain people.

534
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:06,786
Someone should speak to Irene
about picking up strays.

535
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:08,689
- What's a stray?
- You shut up!

536
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,092
- Me?
- No. Cornelia.

537
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:13,926
<i>I will not shut up.
My life is precious to me.</i>

538
00:32:13,998 --> 00:32:16,865
- It won't be in a minute.
- Now, now, children.

539
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:20,427
Come, Carlo. Come and get
some nice hors d'oeuvre.

540
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:25,206
I think we should get our help
from employment agencies.

541
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,801
I don't know
but I agree with Cornelia.

542
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:29,904
<i>What are you all talking about?</i>

543
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:43,889
You upset Carlo,
and now you're upsetting Irene.

544
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,590
Don't you remember her
breakdown last summer?

545
00:32:46,664 --> 00:32:49,462
I certainly do. That's why I'm not
paying any attention to this.

546
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:54,471
If Mother can sponsor Carlo,
why can't I sponsor Godfrey?

547
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:56,734
<i>Godfrey knows I'm not being personal,</i>

548
00:32:56,808 --> 00:33:00,141
<i>but none of us would like to wake up
some morning stabbed to death.</i>

549
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:03,237
You mustn't
come between Irene and Godfrey.

550
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:07,444
<i>He's the first thing she's shown any
affection for since her Pomeranian died.</i>

551
00:33:07,518 --> 00:33:10,419
Now, now, Irene.
You mustn't have a spell.

552
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:13,548
Carlo, quick, quick,
give me a sofa cushion. Here.

553
00:33:13,624 --> 00:33:16,525
Come, darling, lift up
your head like a good girl.

554
00:33:16,594 --> 00:33:19,961
There now, darling, don't cry.
Now, now, darling.

555
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:23,023
She's not having a spell.
That's old stuff.

556
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:25,592
Darling.

557
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,503
- What is all this nonsense?
- Will you be quiet!

558
00:33:28,573 --> 00:33:31,440
You never did understand them.
Why don't you get a doctor?

559
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:34,239
- I don't want a doctor!
- Do you want an ice bag?

560
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:37,713
- I want to die!
- You mustn't do that.

561
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:40,683
She makes me ill.
Let's get out of here.

562
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:44,153
Carlo, do the gorilla for Irene.
It always amuses her.

563
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:47,623
- I'm not in the mood.
- Stop eating and get in the mood.

564
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:50,126
- Here.
- All right.

565
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,492
I'll do it,
but my heart won't be in it.

566
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:55,031
Irene, be a good girl
and sit up and look at Carlo.

567
00:33:55,099 --> 00:33:58,068
<i>You know it always amuses you.
Come on, quick.</i>

568
00:33:58,136 --> 00:34:00,866
Go ahead, go ahead!

569
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:04,135
<i>Go on, Carlo. Quickly.
Look, Irene! Look at Carlo!</i>

570
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:07,541
Isn't that lovely?
Oh, isn't that clever, Irene? Look!

571
00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:17,583
Carlo, come down.
She can see you better.

572
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:20,590
She's starting to laugh.
Isn't he clever?

573
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:23,024
<i>Carlo, come down
where Irene can see you.</i>

574
00:34:23,094 --> 00:34:26,188
<i>She's starting to laugh.</i>

575
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:34,503
<i>Isn't that funny?
Oh, he's on the door. Look! Look!</i>

576
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:37,632
<i>He frightens me!</i>

577
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:40,871
No, darling, you mustn't be frightened.
He's just playing.

578
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:46,807
<i>Darling, look at Carlo.</i>

579
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:56,687
<i>- Look, darling, look. Isn't he clever?
- No!</i>

580
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:59,924
Why don't you stop imitating
a gorilla and imitate a man?

581
00:34:59,997 --> 00:35:02,397
You wouldn't know an artist
if one came up and bit you!

582
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:04,958
This family
doesn't need any stimulant.

583
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:08,028
I'll be in my room.
You can repeat this order in 30 minutes.

584
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:11,075
Someday I'm going gorilla
hunting, and I won't miss.

585
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:14,407
<i>Has Cornelia gone?</i>

586
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:17,004
<i>Yes, darling, she's gone.</i>

587
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:20,141
<i>- Where's Godfrey?
- He's here. Don't go away, Godfrey.</i>

588
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:22,152
<i>We'll be late
for the concert.</i>

589
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,745
I'll be right with you.
Godfrey's right here.

590
00:35:24,822 --> 00:35:28,053
Godfrey, come over here
so Irene can look at you.

591
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,287
- Here's Godfrey, darling.
- Where?

592
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:34,024
Right here. Look. Say hello
to Irene so she'll know who you are.

593
00:35:34,098 --> 00:35:37,067
- Hello.
- Oh, hello, Godfrey.

594
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:40,104
And he's promised to stay on.
Haven't you, Godfrey?

595
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:42,435
- If I'm wanted.
- Of course you're wanted, isn't he?

596
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:45,943
- Yes. Go away.
- I'm going. Take good care of her.

597
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:49,104
Yes, Carlo, I'm coming.
Good-bye, darling, good-bye.

598
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:56,419
I beg your pardon?

599
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:01,417
I'm sorry,
but I didn't quite hear...

600
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:04,689
I said, I'm not really
having a spell.

601
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,905
Hey, cook, you'd better
put this back on the fire.

602
00:36:15,973 --> 00:36:18,965
Looks like we've lost
most of our customers.

603
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:25,805
Well, what's the matter, handsome?
Did something frighten you?

604
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:28,317
What kind of family
am I up against?

605
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:30,786
There are some things
even I can't answer.

606
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:33,119
Do they go on this way
all the time?

607
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:36,627
- Oh, no! This is just a quiet evening.
- Quiet evening?

608
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:39,629
If I were you, I'd
get rid of that lip rouge.

609
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:42,632
Makes you look
a little like Cupid.

610
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,998
You'll find Godfrey
in his room.

611
00:36:49,073 --> 00:36:51,473
How did you know
I want to see Godfrey?

612
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:54,170
I don't know.
It just came over me.

613
00:36:58,015 --> 00:37:00,313
Oh, you...
you can't come in here.

614
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:02,511
Why not?
It's our house, isn't it?

615
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:05,078
One room is just
like any other room.

616
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:07,090
Besides, I want to talk.

617
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:10,321
I'm terribly sorry,
but we can't talk here.

618
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:15,058
Don't you think it's indecent of you
to order me out after you kissed me?

619
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:17,498
<i>After I kissed you,
did you say?</i>

620
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:21,334
Isn't it funny? This morning you were
sitting on my bed; now I'm on yours.

621
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:24,238
We'll overlook
that startling coincidence.

622
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:27,004
- Uh, will you sit over here, please?
- The bed's comfortable.

623
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,842
- If it isn't, I'll get you another.
- We'll have our talk here.

624
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,939
If you want a new bed,
you can have it.

625
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:34,177
Uh, the bed's
very comfortable, thank you.

626
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,618
Much more so
than I am at the moment.

627
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:39,588
Any time you're uncomfortable,
you just let me know.

628
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:44,356
Thank you. Hasn't anyone ever told you
about certain proprieties?

629
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:48,057
You use such lovely big words.
I like big words. What does it mean?

630
00:37:48,132 --> 00:37:50,191
I'll try to simplify it.

631
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,668
Hasn't your mother or anyone
ever explained to you...

632
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:55,672
that some things are proper
and some things are not?

633
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:58,800
She rambles on quite a bit,
but she never says anything.

634
00:37:58,876 --> 00:38:02,334
- But you want me to remain, don't you?
- Oh, of course!

635
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:06,213
And I want to justify your faith in me
by being a very good butler...

636
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:10,482
and filling the void created by the
death of your late, lamented Pomeranian.

637
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:12,886
Oh, I've forgotten about him.
He had fleas, anyway.

638
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:16,085
Besides, you're different. You use
big words, and you're much cuter.

639
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,993
- May I tell you a story?
- I'd love it.

640
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:23,227
Once there was very sentimental
little girl with a very kind heart,

641
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:26,293
and she helped a man
who was very grateful.

642
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:30,329
Then she became a nuisance and undid
all the fine work she had done.

643
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:33,809
- Is it someone you know?
- Her name is Irene Bullock.

644
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:38,212
If she was a smart girl, she'd pick out
some nice chap in her own social set...

645
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:40,682
and marry him and
live happily ever after...

646
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:43,083
and never, never enter
the butler's room again.

647
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,588
- I never can come in here again?
- Never.

648
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:48,420
- When can we talk?
- When I'm serving breakfast,

649
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:50,926
I can say good morning and
you can say good morning.

650
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,691
- But you must never come into my room.
- You'll be sorry!

651
00:38:53,764 --> 00:38:56,562
<i>- I'm only trying to be helpful.
- You're being mean!</i>

652
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:59,797
<i>I'll do something!
You wait and see! You'll be sorry!</i>

653
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:03,101
<i>You'll be sorry!</i>

654
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:08,874
<i>#Ochi Chornie #</i>

655
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:14,441
<i>#Ochi Chornie #</i>

656
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:18,614
<i>#Ochi Chornie #</i>

657
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:22,216
<i>#Ochi Chornie #</i>

658
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:25,558
That's a very pretty tune.
What's the name of it?

659
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:28,792
<i>#Ochi Chornie #</i>

660
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:31,733
<i>Oh, that's the name too.
I thought it was just the words.</i>

661
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:34,669
I like it because
the words are all the same.

662
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:37,867
That's probably why "The Star
Spangled Banner" is so confusing.

663
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:40,240
Nobody seems to know the words.

664
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:43,371
<i>Except, perhaps, Godfrey.
He seems to know everything.</i>

665
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:46,416
- Do you know the words?
- The words?

666
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:49,976
<i>Yes, yes. "The Star Spangled Banner. "
Nobody seems to know the words.</i>

667
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,988
Do you know them, Godfrey?

668
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:54,490
I suppose I know as many
as the average person.

669
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:57,220
I feel ashamed of myself.
I should know them all.

670
00:39:57,294 --> 00:39:59,728
After all, my ancestors
came over on the boat.

671
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:01,992
<i>Not the Mayflower,
but the boat after that.</i>

672
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,796
What did your ancestors
come over on, Godfrey?

673
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:07,337
As far as I know,
they've always been here.

674
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,396
They weren't Indians,
I hope.

675
00:40:09,473 --> 00:40:11,771
One can never be sure
of one's ancestors...

676
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:14,675
You know, you have
rather high cheekbones.

677
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:17,043
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you, ma'am.

678
00:40:17,114 --> 00:40:19,344
<i>These flowers came for Irene.
Where shall I put them?</i>

679
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:22,079
Well, ask her.
There she is now.

680
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:24,212
Yes, ma'am.

681
00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:27,280
Psst, Carlo.
Did you notice his cheekbones?

682
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:30,486
These flowers just came for you, miss.
Where shall I put them?

683
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:34,827
What difference does it make
when one's heart is breaking?

684
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:37,424
Yes, miss.
Shall I put them on the piano?

685
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:39,901
Life is but an empty bubble.

686
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:44,373
<i>You don't sound very cheerful
for a girl who's giving a tea party.</i>

687
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,376
Why should anyone
be cheerful?

688
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,435
Oh, is Irene
giving a tea party?

689
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:50,742
- You're not invited.
- I'll invite myself.

690
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:53,409
<i>- Let's stick around, George.
- Sure. Why not?</i>

691
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:57,545
All I have to say is,
some people will be sorry someday.

692
00:40:57,621 --> 00:41:00,749
- Naturally, everybody will be someday.
- For what?

693
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:04,591
Some people will know for what,
and then it will be too late.

694
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:06,653
This conversation
is very confusing.

695
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:09,164
Now, now, Irene.
You mustn't confuse Carlo.

696
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:11,463
<i>He's practicing.</i>

697
00:41:11,535 --> 00:41:14,060
Do you know any good
funeral music, Carlo?

698
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:16,072
Shut up!

699
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,540
Are you acting
for anybody in particular?

700
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:22,602
Godfrey might be interested, if
he'd only turn around and look.

701
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,444
Oh, I remember
that pose so well.

702
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:29,179
<i>- I learned in dramatic school. Eight?
- Yeah, that's number eight.</i>

703
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:32,120
<i>Am I spoiling your act, dear?</i>

704
00:41:32,189 --> 00:41:36,523
I'll spoil something of yours someday,
and it won't be your act.

705
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:43,899
Do you suppose Miss Irene would
like sandwiches served in here,

706
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:46,493
or shall I create
a sort of buffet?

707
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:48,936
Where do you want
the sandwiches served?

708
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:51,907
- What is food?
- Something you eat, silly.

709
00:41:51,976 --> 00:41:54,774
Do you want the sandwiches
served in here, or don't you?

710
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:57,678
What difference does it make?
Some people do as they like...

711
00:41:57,748 --> 00:42:00,774
with other people's lives,
and it doesn't make any difference.

712
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:24,003
- What did I call?
- Five, hearts.

713
00:42:24,074 --> 00:42:26,634
Was it hearts?
I meant spades.

714
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:29,645
I can't change, can I?
That music has me so confused.

715
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:32,409
Carlo, please!

716
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:34,815
Hi, Irene.
Why the shroud?

717
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:37,911
Listen, Van Rumple, just because
some people have a million dollars...

718
00:42:37,988 --> 00:42:40,980
doesn't mean they can put
their arms around other people.

719
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:43,026
Brrr!
Where's the bar?

720
00:42:43,093 --> 00:42:47,553
Don't take her seriously. The servant
problem's been bothering her lately.

721
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:52,797
No, thank you.
I'm not hungry.

722
00:42:57,675 --> 00:43:00,667
No, thank you.

723
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:05,340
- Four, clubs.
- Oh, just a minute, Godfrey. Uh, bye.

724
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,281
- Hello, everybody!
- Hello, Tommy.

725
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:10,252
- Oh, Tommy Gray!
- Hello there.

726
00:43:10,321 --> 00:43:13,381
What's the matter with you,
Godfrey? Are you ill?

727
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:15,857
Come along, Tommy,
and give Angelica a hug.

728
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:18,724
How's everything in Boston?
All the beans and things?

729
00:43:18,796 --> 00:43:21,287
We're rounding them up
and putting them in cans.

730
00:43:21,365 --> 00:43:23,731
- How are you, darling?
- What does it matter how I am?

731
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:26,531
<i>- The whole thing is only a delusion.
- What thing?</i>

732
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,868
- You wouldn't understand.
- Well, I don't so far.

733
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:31,533
I'm famished.
How about something to eat?

734
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:34,510
Oh, Godfrey,
bring Mr. Gray a sandwich.

735
00:43:34,578 --> 00:43:38,878
It's your play. Well, come around here
Mr. Gray's not an acrobat.

736
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:43,079
What's come over you? You're beginning
to act like the rest of the family.

737
00:43:43,153 --> 00:43:46,452
- Hey, wait a minute!
- What's the trouble?

738
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:50,622
Godfrey Parke, you old mug!

739
00:43:50,694 --> 00:43:53,925
- Oh, do you know Godfrey?
- We went to Harvard together.

740
00:43:53,998 --> 00:43:57,934
<i>I'm afraid you've confused me with
someone else. I'm Smith, remember?</i>

741
00:43:58,002 --> 00:44:01,233
Sure, you're Smith.
We did go to college together?

742
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:04,900
<i>- Or did we?
- A butler with a college education.</i>

743
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:07,500
<i>- He's not really the butler?
- And a very good one.</i>

744
00:44:07,578 --> 00:44:10,411
You mean, this is not a gag
just for my benefit?

745
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:13,973
Mr. Gray neglected to tell you that when
we were in Harvard, I was his valet.

746
00:44:14,051 --> 00:44:17,578
- Was he a good servant, Tommy?
- Excellent.

747
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:20,249
- What's the idea?
- I'll tell you later.

748
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:22,884
- Mr. Gray never complained.
- When?

749
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,428
No, I had very few complaints
about Godfrey's work.

750
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:27,487
I'll tell you tomorrow.
It's my day off.

751
00:44:27,564 --> 00:44:30,328
Strange, you never gave
Mr. Gray as a reference.

752
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:33,859
You see, I left Mr. Gray under
very unusual circumstances.

753
00:44:33,937 --> 00:44:37,464
- What circumstances?
- I'd rather Mr. Gray told you.

754
00:44:37,541 --> 00:44:40,806
<i>Well, don't go away.
Come here and tell us all about it.</i>

755
00:44:40,878 --> 00:44:44,644
Godfrey's a very mysterious person.
Nobody seems to know about him.

756
00:44:44,715 --> 00:44:47,843
<i>- Don't go away, Godfrey.
- No, no, don't go away, Godfrey.</i>

757
00:44:47,918 --> 00:44:50,648
You see, I didn't want to say
anything about this.

758
00:44:50,721 --> 00:44:54,487
But, you see, Godfrey had been working
for us as a butler and whatnot,

759
00:44:54,558 --> 00:44:57,288
and things had been
going along very well...

760
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,522
<i>when all of a sudden it happened...</i>

761
00:44:59,596 --> 00:45:01,530
just like that.

762
00:45:01,598 --> 00:45:05,295
You're sure you want me
to tell all this, Godfrey?

763
00:45:07,304 --> 00:45:09,238
Well, you see, as I said,

764
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:12,571
<i>he'd been working for us for some time,
when one day he came to me and said,</i>

765
00:45:12,643 --> 00:45:16,204
<i>"Mr. Gray, I trust my work
has always been satisfactory. "</i>

766
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:21,741
I said, "Why, of course. I've never had
more satisfactory work in all my life. "

767
00:45:21,819 --> 00:45:25,050
And he said,
"Thank you, Mr. Gray. "

768
00:45:25,122 --> 00:45:28,319
He was always
a very courteous man, Godfrey.

769
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:31,589
<i>Godfrey is still extremely courteous,
especially in the morning.</i>

770
00:45:31,662 --> 00:45:34,358
Well, it's not much of a story.
Maybe we'd better skip it.

771
00:45:34,431 --> 00:45:37,161
Come on, Tommy, finish it.
You can't stop in the middle.

772
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:39,828
- Where was I?
- Telling us how polite Godfrey was.

773
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:42,929
And that's where I said that
Godfrey was still very polite.

774
00:45:43,006 --> 00:45:46,066
Thank you, Mrs. Bullock. It's
a pleasure to have you say so publicly.

775
00:45:46,143 --> 00:45:50,512
That's my nature. I never say anything
behind your back I won't say in public.

776
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,845
That's what I admire
about you, Angelica.

777
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:55,714
That's nice of you, Tommy.
What about the story?

778
00:45:55,786 --> 00:45:59,517
Well, anyway, Godfrey said, "I trust
my work has been satisfactory, sir. "

779
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:02,058
That was about the gist of it,
wasn't it, Godfrey?

780
00:46:02,126 --> 00:46:06,927
Those may not have been my exact words,
sir, but that was about the gist of it.

781
00:46:06,997 --> 00:46:09,966
We'll settle for that.
You said he was very satisfactory.

782
00:46:10,033 --> 00:46:12,524
He said thank you,
and then what?

783
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:16,130
- I had to take an attitude.
- What kind of an attitude?

784
00:46:16,206 --> 00:46:18,970
<i>Well, the only kind I could take
toward a faithful servant.</i>

785
00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:21,442
But Godfrey decided in favor
of his wife and five children.

786
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:24,538
<i>- Five children? My, my!
- Five.</i>

787
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:27,311
Tsk, tsk, tsk. Was his wife
an Indian woman?

788
00:46:27,384 --> 00:46:30,649
She was rather dark. We used to take
her on hunting trips to stalk the game.

789
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:34,316
Godfrey! Why didn't you tell me
you had five children?

790
00:46:34,391 --> 00:46:36,825
Why shouldn't Godfrey
have five children?

791
00:46:36,894 --> 00:46:41,490
If a woman in Canada can have five
children, why can't Godfrey? You see?

792
00:46:41,565 --> 00:46:44,762
I owe the creation of my family
to Mr. Gray's generosity.

793
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:48,931
Well, if other people can have
five children, so can other people.

794
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:52,339
Personally, I think two are plenty,
and Bullock agrees with me.

795
00:46:54,411 --> 00:46:57,403
Listen, everybody, I want
to make an announcement about something.

796
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,415
What do you want
to announce?

797
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:03,010
- I'm going to be married.
- Married? To whom?

798
00:47:03,086 --> 00:47:06,112
- Well, you'll find out soon enough.
- Not Charlie Van Rumple?

799
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:09,751
- Yes, Charlie Van Rumple. Where is he?
- He's at the bar.

800
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:11,761
I've had my arm around her before,

801
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:14,093
but this is the first time
I ever felt that chill.

802
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:17,531
- Congratulations, old boy.
- Congratulations about what?

803
00:47:17,601 --> 00:47:20,195
- Your engagement, you slug.
- What engagement?

804
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:22,636
Why, you're engaged
to Irene, aren't you?

805
00:47:22,706 --> 00:47:25,038
- Am I?
- Don't be ga-ga! Come on!

806
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:31,006
- I hear we're engaged.
- You said it.

807
00:47:31,081 --> 00:47:33,675
- When did it happen?
- Just now.

808
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:37,777
- What's all the excitement?
- I think she's got herself engaged.

809
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:41,222
Oh, has she again? It must
be that nice boy in the brown suit.

810
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:43,384
Let's go and congratulate them.

811
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:45,485
You're a lucky boy.

812
00:47:45,562 --> 00:47:47,928
I know I am.
I'm not Van Rumple.

813
00:47:47,998 --> 00:47:50,296
- Oh, you're not? Which one is he?
- There he is.

814
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:52,301
You'll pardon me, I hope.

815
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:54,860
- You're Van Rumple, aren't you?
- Oh, yes.

816
00:47:54,938 --> 00:47:58,066
- Oh, you'll take good care of her.
- I imagine so.

817
00:47:58,141 --> 00:48:01,167
My mind's a little cloudy.
I don't even remember proposing.

818
00:48:01,245 --> 00:48:03,713
You're always proposing.

819
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:07,546
- Which one did you take me up on?
- All of them.

820
00:48:07,618 --> 00:48:10,917
How do you think Godfrey'll
feel about your engagement?

821
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:13,786
- What has Godfrey got to do with it?
- I wonder.

822
00:48:13,857 --> 00:48:16,792
- You mind your own business.
- All right, let's have those.

823
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:20,193
- Come on, everybody.
- Are you going to congratulate Irene?

824
00:48:20,264 --> 00:48:23,495
- She just got herself engaged.
- I'd be very happy to.

825
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:25,831
<i>Godfrey, come congratulate Irene.</i>

826
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:28,098
May I congratulate you, Miss Irene?

827
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:31,197
I wish you all
the happiness in the world.

828
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:37,839
<i>Just leave her alone.
She'll be all right in a minute.</i>

829
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:40,315
- Is she mad at me?
- She's not mad at anybody.

830
00:48:40,384 --> 00:48:43,751
Women always cry at their own
engagements and other people's weddings.

831
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:47,278
- Why?
- I don't know why, but they just do.

832
00:48:47,357 --> 00:48:50,884
Irene is so peculiar. She shouts when
she weeps and cries when she's happy.

833
00:48:50,961 --> 00:48:53,987
- Alexander, you missed the excitement.
- What's going on?

834
00:48:54,064 --> 00:48:56,862
I knew what I wanted to say,
but somehow it slipped my mind.

835
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:59,198
- What's the matter with Irene?
- Oh, yes, that's it!

836
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:01,203
- Irene's got engaged.
- To whom?

837
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:04,434
Van something or other. I think he's
that boy with his arm around that girl.

838
00:49:04,508 --> 00:49:06,476
- He's got lots of money.
- He'll need it.

839
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:08,807
Godfrey, let's you and I
have a good cry.

840
00:49:08,879 --> 00:49:11,074
How about lunch
by my hotel tomorrow?

841
00:49:11,148 --> 00:49:13,946
Yes, sir. Do you prefer
soda or ginger ale?

842
00:49:14,017 --> 00:49:16,713
- Both. 12:00?
- Very good, sir.

843
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:23,325
Make up your mind just who she's going
to marry. I'd like to meet the guy.

844
00:49:23,393 --> 00:49:26,692
<i>I don't know, Alexander.
It's one of those boys in there.</i>

845
00:49:26,763 --> 00:49:28,697
<i>Come along, now.</i>

846
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:42,343
You're not eating well
this morning, sir.

847
00:49:42,412 --> 00:49:45,472
- You notice everything.
- Business trouble, sir?

848
00:49:45,549 --> 00:49:48,279
What made you ask that?

849
00:49:48,352 --> 00:49:53,187
Well, sir, butlers can't help picking
up scraps of news, shall we say?

850
00:49:53,256 --> 00:49:55,451
We shan't say
anything about it.

851
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:57,618
I thought I might be
of some help, sir.

852
00:49:57,694 --> 00:49:59,821
I dabbled in the market
at one time.

853
00:49:59,896 --> 00:50:02,421
One dabbler in the family
is quite enough.

854
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:05,593
- Very good, sir. Your eggs.
- No, thank you.

855
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:09,503
Godfrey, you seem to be
a pretty good sort.

856
00:50:09,573 --> 00:50:13,134
Have you noticed anything queer
about me lately?

857
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:15,371
Nothing particularly, sir.

858
00:50:15,445 --> 00:50:20,109
I sometimes wonder whether my whole
family's gone mad or whether it's me.

859
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:23,880
I know how you feel. I've felt that
way many times since I've been here.

860
00:50:23,954 --> 00:50:27,583
Then why do you stay here?
I have to; you don't.

861
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:31,388
It's much more comfortable than living
in a packing box on the city dump, sir.

862
00:50:31,461 --> 00:50:33,725
Besides, I'm rather proud
of my job here.

863
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:37,198
<i>- You're proud of being a butler?
- Proud of being a good butler.</i>

864
00:50:37,267 --> 00:50:40,964
And I may add, sir, a butler
has to be good to hold his job here.

865
00:50:46,276 --> 00:50:49,837
Say... who are you?

866
00:50:51,448 --> 00:50:54,906
I'm just a nobody, sir.
Coffee?

867
00:50:57,054 --> 00:51:00,990
Godfrey, here I am.
So you've turned up at last, eh?

868
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:03,993
I began to think
you had fallen down the kitchen sink.

869
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:07,428
Sorry I'm late, Tommy.
It's hard to make beds full of people.

870
00:51:07,497 --> 00:51:10,728
Waiter! You seem to do everything
except put out the cat.

871
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:13,395
I suppose I'd do that too,
only we have no cat.

872
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:16,837
The same for me.
What will you have, Jarvis, my man?

873
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:19,034
Make it a rousing
old lemonade.

874
00:51:19,109 --> 00:51:21,077
Lemonade? You sure
you can handle it?

875
00:51:21,144 --> 00:51:24,079
Oh, yes, I'm the type who
can take it or leave it alone.

876
00:51:24,147 --> 00:51:27,548
You see, now that I'm a working man,
I have to keep my wits about me.

877
00:51:27,617 --> 00:51:30,848
I'm beginning to wonder if you've got
any left. Don't avoid the issue.

878
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:33,446
I've been sitting here
like a snoopy old maid...

879
00:51:33,523 --> 00:51:36,686
with her ears flapping in the breeze,
waiting to hear the dirt.

880
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,694
What dirt
would you like to hear?

881
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:42,858
Well, when I see one of the Parkes
of Boston serving hors d'oeuvre...

882
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:45,993
I think I'm entitled
to a pardonable curiosity.

883
00:51:46,069 --> 00:51:48,867
Why tell you something
that you won't understand?

884
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:52,397
You've fallen off so many polo ponies
that your brain is scrambled.

885
00:51:52,476 --> 00:51:54,967
But I still want to know
why you're buttling,

886
00:51:55,045 --> 00:51:58,537
when your family is telling everybody
that you're in South America.

887
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:01,209
A family has to say something
to save its face.

888
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:03,445
The Parkes disgrace
very easily.

889
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:06,887
I'd like to see their faces when they
find out that you're a butler.

890
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:11,291
- They're not going to find it out.
- Come to the point.

891
00:52:11,361 --> 00:52:14,057
Well, there isn't
much of a point.

892
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:16,759
Do you remember that little
incident up in Boston?

893
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:19,666
You still have that woman
on your mind?

894
00:52:19,736 --> 00:52:23,672
No, not anymore.
But I was pretty bitter at the time.

895
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:27,335
So I gave her everything I had
and just disappeared.

896
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:31,312
You know, the Parkes were
never educated to face life.

897
00:52:31,381 --> 00:52:34,145
<i>- We've been puppets for ten generations.
- And?</i>

898
00:52:34,217 --> 00:52:37,584
Tommy, it's surprising
how fast you can go downhill...

899
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:40,214
when you begin
to feel sorry for yourself.

900
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:42,986
And boy did I feel sorry
for myself!

901
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:45,357
I wandered down
to the East River one night,

902
00:52:45,428 --> 00:52:48,693
thinking I'd just slide in
and get it over with.

903
00:52:48,765 --> 00:52:51,199
But I met some fellows
living there, on a city dump.

904
00:52:51,268 --> 00:52:55,227
They were people who were fighting
it out and not complaining.

905
00:52:55,305 --> 00:52:57,830
I never got
as far as the river.

906
00:52:57,908 --> 00:53:00,433
Would you do me
a big favor?

907
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:02,705
- Who do you want killed?
- I'll do my own killing.

908
00:53:02,779 --> 00:53:05,771
Go around the corner and telephone
this place and ask for Tommy Gray.

909
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:08,147
When you get him on the wire,
keep him there.

910
00:53:08,218 --> 00:53:10,846
- What's this all about?
- Don't ask too many questions.

911
00:53:10,921 --> 00:53:12,855
Okay.

912
00:53:12,923 --> 00:53:15,585
And so out of the ruins
of Godfrey Parke...

913
00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:18,787
a new edifice has sprung up
in the form of Godfrey Smith.

914
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:21,763
And, I may add, the edifice
is going to keep on springing.

915
00:53:21,831 --> 00:53:24,095
Do you intend
to remain a butler?

916
00:53:24,167 --> 00:53:26,431
No, I have
some other ideas in mind.

917
00:53:26,503 --> 00:53:29,734
But you wouldn't understand
those either, so we won't go into that.

918
00:53:29,806 --> 00:53:32,206
- Will you do me a favor?
- Maybe.

919
00:53:32,275 --> 00:53:35,142
I have a friend in town,
a very eminent brain specialist.

920
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:37,146
I'd like him
to examine you.

921
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:40,183
I'll submit to an examination,
if you will also.

922
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:42,718
That's a bet.

923
00:53:42,786 --> 00:53:44,720
- Are you Mr. Gray?
- Yes.

924
00:53:44,788 --> 00:53:47,052
- You're wanted on the phone.
- On the phone? What the...

925
00:53:47,123 --> 00:53:49,523
Back in a minute, Godfrey.

926
00:53:57,701 --> 00:54:00,693
- Well, the mystery's solved.
- The mystery?

927
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:04,206
Yes. Now I know what
a butler does on his day off.

928
00:54:04,274 --> 00:54:07,437
When you worked for Mr. Gray,
were the two of you always this chummy?

929
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:10,911
You see, I worked for Mr. Gray
a long time, and we got to be...

930
00:54:10,981 --> 00:54:13,643
Yeah, that was under
the name of Smith, wasn't it?

931
00:54:13,717 --> 00:54:16,208
Or did I hear him mention
the name of Parke?

932
00:54:16,286 --> 00:54:20,279
He may have said that we used to take
long walks in the park.

933
00:54:20,357 --> 00:54:22,291
- A sort of custom.
- Oh, yes, I see.

934
00:54:22,359 --> 00:54:24,293
Well, if you can be so chummy
with the Grays,

935
00:54:24,361 --> 00:54:26,352
why can't you be chummy
with the Bullocks?

936
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:29,956
- I try to keep my place.
- Why? You're very attractive.

937
00:54:30,033 --> 00:54:32,467
- As a butler?
- No, as a Smith.

938
00:54:32,535 --> 00:54:35,868
- You're a rotten butler.
- Sorry.

939
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:38,430
Are we going to be friends?

940
00:54:38,508 --> 00:54:42,103
I feel that on my day off, I should have
the privilege of choosing my friends.

941
00:54:42,178 --> 00:54:44,203
You can't go on like this forever.

942
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:47,148
You really like me, and you're
afraid to admit it, aren't you?

943
00:54:47,217 --> 00:54:49,879
Do you want me to tell you
what I really think of you?

944
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:52,444
- Please do.
- As Smith or as a butler?

945
00:54:52,522 --> 00:54:55,548
- Choose your own weapon.
- You won't hold it against me?

946
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:58,116
- It's your day off.
- Very well.

947
00:54:58,194 --> 00:55:00,788
You belong to that
unfortunate category...

948
00:55:00,864 --> 00:55:03,389
that I would call
the Park Avenue brat.

949
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:06,629
A spoiled child who's
grown up in ease and luxury,

950
00:55:06,703 --> 00:55:09,001
who's always
had her own way,

951
00:55:09,072 --> 00:55:11,939
and whose misdirected
energies are so childish...

952
00:55:12,008 --> 00:55:16,069
that they hardly deserve the comment
even of a butler on his offThursday.

953
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:18,080
Thank you for a very lovely portrait.

954
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:20,412
Hiya, Cornelia.
What are you doing here?

955
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:22,747
Godfrey and I were discussing
tomorrow's menu.

956
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:25,617
- Well, don't run away.
- I'm in an awfully big hurry. Good-bye.

957
00:55:25,689 --> 00:55:28,089
I'll see you
down by the ash pile.

958
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:30,991
- What did she mean by that?
- A little joke we have between us.

959
00:55:31,061 --> 00:55:33,086
Oh, I see.
Ajoking butler.

960
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:35,256
What's the matter
with that stuff?

961
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:37,800
I think I'll switch.
I'm more at mood.

962
00:55:37,867 --> 00:55:40,301
Now we're getting
someplace. Waiter!

963
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:42,497
Another one of these.

964
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,910
- He's not back yet, is he?
- Not yet.

965
00:55:55,985 --> 00:55:58,681
Would you mind putting these
flowers in his room?

966
00:55:58,755 --> 00:56:01,383
- I can't go in there anymore.
- I can't, either.

967
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:04,393
- You won't tell him they're from me?
- If you don't want me to.

968
00:56:04,461 --> 00:56:06,952
Oh, I don't want him
to know.

969
00:56:11,468 --> 00:56:13,402
It's his, isn't it?

970
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:15,700
- Do you always sew his buttons on?
- Sometimes.

971
00:56:15,772 --> 00:56:18,900
I'd like to sew his buttons on
sometime when they come off.

972
00:56:18,975 --> 00:56:21,443
- I wouldn't mind at all.
- He doesn't lose very many.

973
00:56:21,511 --> 00:56:24,480
- Oh, he's very tidy...
- Yes, he's very tidy.

974
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:27,983
- What does he do on his day off?
- He never tells me.

975
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:31,487
He's probably sitting somewhere
with some woman on his lap.

976
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:33,749
He's the meanest man I know.

977
00:56:33,823 --> 00:56:35,757
I think he's very mean.

978
00:56:35,825 --> 00:56:37,986
I suppose he's sitting
somewhere with somebody on his lap...

979
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:40,689
who doesn't care for him at all.

980
00:56:40,764 --> 00:56:45,701
As far as I know, maybe his children
are there too, calling him, calling him.

981
00:56:45,769 --> 00:56:47,930
Oh, I can't bear it.

982
00:56:48,004 --> 00:56:50,097
Please don't.

983
00:56:54,377 --> 00:56:56,607
You too?

984
00:56:56,679 --> 00:56:59,204
Oh, Molly, I know
exactly how you feel.

985
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:10,359
Good evening.

986
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:13,191
How about a quartet?

987
00:57:15,398 --> 00:57:17,696
Ehh!

988
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:20,793
# For tomorrow may bring sorrow #

989
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:23,839
# So tonight let us be gay #

990
00:57:26,209 --> 00:57:28,939
"'Courage,' she said,
and pointed toward the land.

991
00:57:29,012 --> 00:57:31,503
"'This wave will roll ashore
but soon. '

992
00:57:31,581 --> 00:57:33,742
"And the afternoon
came into a land...

993
00:57:33,817 --> 00:57:36,012
into which it seemed
always afternoon. "

994
00:57:36,085 --> 00:57:39,919
"All around the coast
the languid air did swoon. "

995
00:57:39,989 --> 00:57:42,150
- What's the matter, darling?
- Nothing.

996
00:57:42,225 --> 00:57:45,160
- She's been eating onions.
- Onions make me sleepy.

997
00:57:45,228 --> 00:57:47,992
Irene loves onions.
When she was a little girl,

998
00:57:48,064 --> 00:57:50,658
she was always stealing
onions from the icebox.

999
00:57:50,733 --> 00:57:53,759
You know, sometimes
I wonder if my children are all there.

1000
00:57:53,837 --> 00:57:56,772
"Like a downward smoke,
the slender stream along the cliff...

1001
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:59,866
did fall and fall
and fall to the sea. "

1002
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:36,111
Evening.

1003
00:58:50,927 --> 00:58:54,988
I thought I told you to send that
gray satin evening dress to the cleaner.

1004
00:58:55,064 --> 00:58:58,056
- Gray satin?
- Why can't you do as you're told?

1005
00:58:58,134 --> 00:59:00,068
With pleasure.

1006
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:09,402
Seems to me that every time you pick up
a paper, somebody's been murdered.

1007
00:59:09,479 --> 00:59:11,970
Imagine a man drowning
his wife in a bathtub.

1008
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:14,573
Maybe it's the only way
he could get her to take a bath.

1009
00:59:14,651 --> 00:59:17,916
Well, if anyone ever drowned
my Duke in their bathtub,

1010
00:59:17,987 --> 00:59:20,854
<i>his mama would be
very sad, she would.</i>

1011
00:59:20,924 --> 00:59:23,188
Will there be
anything else, madam?

1012
00:59:23,259 --> 00:59:26,626
I haven't asked for anything, so I don't
see how I could want anything.

1013
00:59:26,696 --> 00:59:29,790
I beg your pardon.
I thought you were Miss Cornelia.

1014
00:59:29,866 --> 00:59:31,993
You thought
I was Cornelia?

1015
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:36,903
Forgive me, but you seem to be looking
younger every day, if I may say so.

1016
00:59:36,973 --> 00:59:41,069
You certainly may. Thank you very much.

1017
01:02:05,286 --> 01:02:08,221
Did you send Godfrey
upstairs for anything?

1018
01:02:08,289 --> 01:02:11,224
Did I? No, I'm quite sure I didn't.
Why?

1019
01:02:11,292 --> 01:02:13,283
I just wondered.

1020
01:02:24,138 --> 01:02:26,868
I was in the Kerry Bar today.
That place is getting run down.

1021
01:02:26,941 --> 01:02:29,466
They're catering
to a very low class of people.

1022
01:02:29,543 --> 01:02:31,568
You shouldn't
go in there, my dear.

1023
01:02:31,646 --> 01:02:33,841
Darling, what's the matter?
You're not eating anything.

1024
01:02:33,914 --> 01:02:36,178
Nobody cares
if I starve myself to death.

1025
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:38,275
<i>What's the matter with you?</i>

1026
01:02:38,352 --> 01:02:40,616
I don't mind dying,
if other people don't.

1027
01:02:40,688 --> 01:02:43,088
She's in love.
Haven't you heard?

1028
01:02:43,157 --> 01:02:47,594
It's probably her engagement. Several
of my girlfriends acted just like that.

1029
01:02:47,662 --> 01:02:50,961
- Maybe her stomach is upset.
- Nobody asked you!

1030
01:02:58,172 --> 01:03:00,402
There goes the profits.

1031
01:03:00,474 --> 01:03:02,465
I beg your pardon.

1032
01:03:02,543 --> 01:03:06,206
I don't know what's the matter with
Godfrey. He's been acting so peculiar.

1033
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:08,373
But he did pay me
a nice compliment.

1034
01:03:08,449 --> 01:03:10,644
He's always paying
other people compliments.

1035
01:03:10,718 --> 01:03:14,654
Why don't you eat? Look at Carlo.
He's had two helpings of everything.

1036
01:03:14,722 --> 01:03:17,418
Leave her alone. Carlo's eating
enough for both of them.

1037
01:03:17,491 --> 01:03:21,052
He ought to be strong enough
soon to give that concert.

1038
01:03:21,128 --> 01:03:22,993
You can't rush genius.

1039
01:03:23,064 --> 01:03:26,864
He could give a bang-up concert
right now with a knife and fork.

1040
01:03:26,934 --> 01:03:31,394
Why do you always pick on Carlo?
Why not try someone else for a change?

1041
01:03:33,708 --> 01:03:36,905
Wait a minute, Mother. Come here, Dad.
Something terrible has happened.

1042
01:03:36,977 --> 01:03:38,911
What is it?
What's happened?

1043
01:03:38,979 --> 01:03:41,846
You look frightened.
You're as white as a sheet.

1044
01:03:41,916 --> 01:03:45,477
Let's go into the living room,
where we won't be overheard.

1045
01:03:45,553 --> 01:03:48,818
Cornelia, what is it?
Are you ill?

1046
01:03:48,889 --> 01:03:51,824
Come, come, sit down here.
Let me get you an aspirin or something.

1047
01:03:51,892 --> 01:03:54,486
- I'm all right.
- What's troubling you?

1048
01:03:54,562 --> 01:03:57,224
Do you remember the pearl necklace
I got for my birthday?

1049
01:03:57,298 --> 01:03:59,232
- Why, yes!
- What about it?

1050
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:01,427
- It's disappeared.
- Maybe somebody stole it.

1051
01:04:01,502 --> 01:04:03,970
Will you fill your gob
and keep out of this!

1052
01:04:04,038 --> 01:04:06,836
- I was only trying to help.
- We don't need your help.

1053
01:04:06,907 --> 01:04:09,705
- When did you find out?
- I put it on my dressing table.

1054
01:04:09,777 --> 01:04:12,143
I went upstairs just now,
and it was gone.

1055
01:04:12,213 --> 01:04:15,046
- And it cost such a lot of money.
- I'll say it did.

1056
01:04:15,116 --> 01:04:17,607
- What are we going to do?
- I'll go call the police.

1057
01:04:17,685 --> 01:04:20,051
Never mind, Dad.
I've already called them.

1058
01:04:20,121 --> 01:04:22,055
Oh!

1059
01:04:22,123 --> 01:04:26,059
Mm-mm. Well, what I want to know is,
when did you miss the pearls?

1060
01:04:26,127 --> 01:04:29,028
During dinner I went to my room,
and they were gone.

1061
01:04:29,096 --> 01:04:32,395
- She's always leaving them.
- Nobody asked you anything.

1062
01:04:32,466 --> 01:04:36,197
If you're going to be rude to my
daughter, you might take your hats off.

1063
01:04:36,270 --> 01:04:39,239
When we're on criminal cases,
lady, we keep both hands free.

1064
01:04:39,306 --> 01:04:41,467
You mean to imply
that I'm a criminal?

1065
01:04:41,542 --> 01:04:44,204
All I know is
that it's an inside job.

1066
01:04:46,113 --> 01:04:48,581
- Who's that?
- It's Mother's protege.

1067
01:04:48,649 --> 01:04:51,379
No wise cracks.
Is that your son?

1068
01:04:51,452 --> 01:04:54,182
That? Say, listen, I've made
a lot of mistakes in my life,

1069
01:04:54,255 --> 01:04:56,655
but I'll be hanged
if I'll plead guilty to that.

1070
01:04:56,724 --> 01:04:58,783
<i>Stop picking on Carlo!</i>

1071
01:04:58,859 --> 01:05:02,295
He wouldn't have time to steal anything.
He's too busy eating.

1072
01:05:02,363 --> 01:05:04,490
- Who are you?
- Guess.

1073
01:05:04,565 --> 01:05:07,591
- Where is Godfrey?
- He isn't feeling very well.

1074
01:05:07,668 --> 01:05:11,126
- Who are you staring at?
- Just a minute, sister.

1075
01:05:11,205 --> 01:05:14,436
If I thought that were true,
I'd disown my parents.

1076
01:05:14,508 --> 01:05:17,636
So you got a passion for jewelry, huh?

1077
01:05:17,711 --> 01:05:20,077
Yes, and I got a passion
for socking cops.

1078
01:05:20,147 --> 01:05:22,741
- Where are they?
- Most of them are in cemeteries.

1079
01:05:22,817 --> 01:05:25,217
- Where is the necklace?
- Maybe I swallowed it.

1080
01:05:25,286 --> 01:05:28,255
You mustn't accuse Molly.
She's been with us a long time.

1081
01:05:28,322 --> 01:05:31,291
- That in itself is some recommendation.
- Thank you, Molly.

1082
01:05:31,358 --> 01:05:33,918
You're welcome.
I'll turn down the beds.

1083
01:05:33,994 --> 01:05:36,895
- Who is this Godfrey?
- He's the best butler we ever had.

1084
01:05:36,964 --> 01:05:40,127
Oh, I'm sure Godfrey didn't take them,
though we don't know much about him.

1085
01:05:40,201 --> 01:05:42,601
Godfrey wouldn't touch
those old pearls with a fork.

1086
01:05:42,670 --> 01:05:45,696
Just a minute. What do you mean
you don't know much about him?

1087
01:05:45,773 --> 01:05:48,333
We didn't get him
from an employment agency.

1088
01:05:48,409 --> 01:05:51,207
- My sister found him on a city dump.
- Oh, I see.

1089
01:05:51,278 --> 01:05:54,372
- Are you accusing Godfrey?
- I only want my necklace.

1090
01:05:54,448 --> 01:05:57,747
It's so silly to think of Godfrey
wearing a pearl necklace.

1091
01:05:57,818 --> 01:06:00,480
- Where is this butler?
- He's probably in his room.

1092
01:06:00,554 --> 01:06:04,115
- Where is that?
- It's back this way.

1093
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:08,385
That's his room over there.

1094
01:06:08,462 --> 01:06:11,158
Godfrey, if you've got 'em,
hide 'em!

1095
01:06:11,232 --> 01:06:14,326
- Hey, what kind of a joint is this?
- All right, lady.

1096
01:06:18,606 --> 01:06:20,540
Hello, men.

1097
01:06:20,608 --> 01:06:22,542
- Where are they?
- Where?

1098
01:06:22,610 --> 01:06:24,703
That's what I said.
Where?

1099
01:06:24,778 --> 01:06:27,542
#Where oh where
has my little dog gone #

1100
01:06:27,615 --> 01:06:30,345
Come on, snap out of it!

1101
01:06:30,417 --> 01:06:33,545
- You notice he's been drinking.
- He has not been drinking!

1102
01:06:33,621 --> 01:06:37,079
I don't blame him if he has.
This family's probably got to him too.

1103
01:06:37,157 --> 01:06:40,217
Do you mind if we search
your room, Godfrey?

1104
01:06:40,294 --> 01:06:42,524
Somebody lost?

1105
01:06:42,596 --> 01:06:45,030
There seems to be
a pearl necklace missing.

1106
01:06:45,099 --> 01:06:47,932
- Do you know anything about it?
- Well, let's look for it.

1107
01:06:48,002 --> 01:06:50,163
- That's too bad.
- It's too bad for you.

1108
01:06:50,237 --> 01:06:53,400
I wouldn't be so cocksure of everything.
This is a serious matter.

1109
01:06:53,474 --> 01:06:55,738
<i>The pearls couldn't just
get up and walk away.</i>

1110
01:06:55,809 --> 01:06:58,277
She probably threw them
out of the taxi.

1111
01:06:58,345 --> 01:07:01,644
Let's look under the rug.
Maybe that's where I put it.

1112
01:07:01,715 --> 01:07:04,377
We'll do the searching,
Godfrey, old boy.

1113
01:07:04,451 --> 01:07:06,544
- It's a pleasure.
- This is all very silly.

1114
01:07:06,620 --> 01:07:10,021
I can imagine a woman stealing pearls,
but what would Godfrey do with them?

1115
01:07:10,090 --> 01:07:14,083
- Look under the mattress.
- Yes, there's a dandy place.

1116
01:07:23,370 --> 01:07:25,804
<i>Well, they're not here.</i>

1117
01:07:25,873 --> 01:07:28,034
They must be there.

1118
01:07:28,108 --> 01:07:31,874
Just a minute. What makes you so sure
they oughta be under the mattress?

1119
01:07:31,946 --> 01:07:34,915
I read that that's where people
put things when they steal them.

1120
01:07:34,982 --> 01:07:38,748
<i>- Oh, yeah?
- Say, what are you up to?</i>

1121
01:07:38,819 --> 01:07:42,983
I'd like to talk to you boys outside
for just a minute, if you don't mind.

1122
01:07:48,562 --> 01:07:51,588
<i>- I'm terribly sorry, Godfrey.
- I told you so.</i>

1123
01:07:51,665 --> 01:07:56,602
<i>We're all terribly
sorry, Godfrey. Come, Cornelia.</i>

1124
01:08:00,607 --> 01:08:03,167
Yah, yah, yah, yah!

1125
01:08:07,381 --> 01:08:12,182
I wanna apologize for my family.
They're all slightly hysterical.

1126
01:08:12,252 --> 01:08:15,949
- We got an idea what you're up against.
- I'd like to let the matter drop.

1127
01:08:16,023 --> 01:08:20,119
She probably mislaid her necklace.
I'm not certain she had one.

1128
01:08:20,194 --> 01:08:22,458
There's something phony
about the whole thing.

1129
01:08:22,529 --> 01:08:24,963
That's all a mistake.
And if you don't mind,

1130
01:08:25,032 --> 01:08:27,967
I'd like to send a little check
tomorrow to the pension fund.

1131
01:08:28,035 --> 01:08:30,731
- Okay, Mr. Bullock. Thanks very much.
- Good night.

1132
01:08:30,804 --> 01:08:33,705
- The whole thing's forgotten.
- Good night, boys.

1133
01:08:37,945 --> 01:08:40,505
Just what have you got
to say for yourself?

1134
01:08:40,581 --> 01:08:43,049
Aren't they going to do
anything about it?

1135
01:08:43,117 --> 01:08:45,984
No, and it's a good thing
for you that they're not.

1136
01:08:46,053 --> 01:08:49,955
And something else. If you don't find
your necklace, the joke's on you...

1137
01:08:50,024 --> 01:08:52,891
because it's not insured.

1138
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:55,588
Cornelia lost her pearls,
and I've got mine!

1139
01:08:55,662 --> 01:08:58,096
Cornelia lost her pearls,
and I've got mine!

1140
01:08:58,165 --> 01:09:00,599
Cornelia lost her pearls,
and I've got mine!

1141
01:09:15,315 --> 01:09:19,149
Well, here we are, Tommy.
The village of forgotten men.

1142
01:09:19,219 --> 01:09:22,484
- How do you like it?
- I don't know but I prefer Newport.

1143
01:09:22,556 --> 01:09:26,151
It's a matter of choice.
Unfortunately, these men have no choice.

1144
01:09:26,226 --> 01:09:28,820
I still prefer Newport.

1145
01:09:28,896 --> 01:09:31,626
What is that
delightful aroma?

1146
01:09:31,698 --> 01:09:35,566
Oh, that's Old Man River.
You get used to it after a while.

1147
01:09:35,636 --> 01:09:38,469
Do you mean to say that people
really live in this place?

1148
01:09:38,539 --> 01:09:40,666
Well, they go through
the motions.

1149
01:09:40,741 --> 01:09:43,642
Tommy, observe yon
structure on your left.

1150
01:09:43,710 --> 01:09:47,271
That was the birthplace
of the celebrated butler Godfrey Smith.

1151
01:09:47,347 --> 01:09:51,181
- Where are the ashes of Godfrey Parke?
- Scattered to the winds.

1152
01:09:51,251 --> 01:09:53,685
- Hello, Duke. Well, well.
- Hiya, Mike.

1153
01:09:53,754 --> 01:09:56,450
- How's tricks?
- Meet Mr. Gray. Mr. Flaherty.

1154
01:09:56,523 --> 01:09:59,515
Mr. Gray, pardon my wet paw.
I've been washing my lingerie.

1155
01:09:59,593 --> 01:10:02,960
- That's okay.
- Hey, Bob, look who's here.

1156
01:10:03,030 --> 01:10:07,228
<i>- Hi, Bob.
- Well, bust my false teeth!</i>

1157
01:10:07,301 --> 01:10:10,395
Say, thanks for the beans.
They got here just in time.

1158
01:10:10,471 --> 01:10:14,567
What's up? The beans was marvelous.
We ate everything but the can.

1159
01:10:14,641 --> 01:10:16,131
Don't thank me.
Thank Mr. Gray.

1160
01:10:16,210 --> 01:10:18,144
He's got a corner
on the bean market.

1161
01:10:18,212 --> 01:10:20,612
Is that the same corner
that prosperity's just around?

1162
01:10:20,681 --> 01:10:23,172
No, that's another one.
Hello, Arthur.

1163
01:10:23,250 --> 01:10:25,912
- Hello, Duke.
- Meet Mr. Gray. Mr. Bellinger.

1164
01:10:25,986 --> 01:10:28,716
You look as though you've got a job too.
Is this an epidemic?

1165
01:10:28,789 --> 01:10:31,053
<i>Hey, Mike. Let's get goin'.</i>

1166
01:10:31,125 --> 01:10:33,491
Duke, we gotta run along.
This is moving day.

1167
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:37,519
We gotta help the boys move their
shacks. The trucks are crowding in.

1168
01:10:37,598 --> 01:10:40,066
We oughta be in the river
by early spring.

1169
01:10:40,134 --> 01:10:43,729
We might be able to float
by that time. See you again.

1170
01:10:43,804 --> 01:10:45,738
Right.

1171
01:10:45,806 --> 01:10:49,742
That fellow with the bundle of wood
is Bellinger of the Second National.

1172
01:10:49,810 --> 01:10:53,337
When his bank failed,
he gave up everything
so his depositors wouldn't suffer.

1173
01:10:53,413 --> 01:10:55,347
- Not really?
- Really.

1174
01:10:55,415 --> 01:10:57,975
There are two kinds of people:
Those who fight the idea...

1175
01:10:58,051 --> 01:11:00,747
of being pushed into the river
and the other kind.

1176
01:11:00,821 --> 01:11:03,517
After all, things have always
been this way for some people.

1177
01:11:03,590 --> 01:11:05,751
These men are not
your responsibility.

1178
01:11:05,826 --> 01:11:07,851
There are different ways
of having fun.

1179
01:11:07,928 --> 01:11:10,055
You have a peculiar
sense of humor.

1180
01:11:10,130 --> 01:11:12,564
Here we have some very
fashionable apartment houses,

1181
01:11:12,633 --> 01:11:14,965
over there is
a very swanky nightclub...

1182
01:11:15,035 --> 01:11:17,435
while down here men starve
for want of a job.

1183
01:11:17,504 --> 01:11:20,405
- How does that strike you?
- What's this leading to?

1184
01:11:20,474 --> 01:11:23,341
Tommy, there's a very peculiar
mental process called thinking.

1185
01:11:23,410 --> 01:11:25,503
You wouldn't know
much about that.

1186
01:11:25,579 --> 01:11:28,013
But when I was living here,
I did a lot of it.

1187
01:11:28,081 --> 01:11:32,814
One thing I discovered was
that the only difference between
a derelict and a man is a job.

1188
01:11:32,886 --> 01:11:36,447
Sit down over here and rest your weary
bones. Let me tell you what I want.

1189
01:11:36,523 --> 01:11:39,788
Well, I'll listen, but I still think
you belong in a psychopathic ward.

1190
01:11:39,860 --> 01:11:44,263
You may be right, but let me tell you
my plan, and listen with both ears.

1191
01:11:44,331 --> 01:11:46,265
I have an idea...

1192
01:12:21,168 --> 01:12:24,001
Did you and Irene have a good time
while you were in Europe?

1193
01:12:24,071 --> 01:12:26,699
Oh, as good a time as anyone
could have with Irene.

1194
01:12:26,773 --> 01:12:29,037
- You should be more civil to Carlo.
- Why?

1195
01:12:29,109 --> 01:12:31,839
<i>- I don't mind. Cherchez la femme.
- That will hold you.</i>

1196
01:12:31,912 --> 01:12:34,847
Carlo always has such a clever answer
for everything.

1197
01:12:34,915 --> 01:12:36,849
Darling, do you want
some coffee?

1198
01:12:36,917 --> 01:12:38,851
- No, thank you.
- She didn't eat any dinner, either.

1199
01:12:38,919 --> 01:12:40,853
- You had plenty.
- I can't say anything!

1200
01:12:40,921 --> 01:12:43,014
- You never do.
- Oh, what's come over you?

1201
01:12:43,090 --> 01:12:45,217
We spend good money
to send you abroad,

1202
01:12:45,292 --> 01:12:47,453
and you're worse off
than when you left.

1203
01:12:47,527 --> 01:12:49,791
<i>- Her liver is probably upset.
- Take a liver pill.</i>

1204
01:12:49,863 --> 01:12:53,026
- I don't want a liver pill.
- You mustn't get upset.

1205
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:54,863
You've broken many before
and never acted this way.

1206
01:12:54,935 --> 01:12:59,872
She's upset because Godfrey didn't fall
down in a faint when we got in today.

1207
01:12:59,940 --> 01:13:02,204
Why should Godfrey
fall in a faint?

1208
01:13:02,276 --> 01:13:04,870
He didn't make enough fuss
over her homecoming to suit her.

1209
01:13:04,945 --> 01:13:07,311
Well, Godfrey's
not the fussing kind. Shh.

1210
01:13:07,381 --> 01:13:11,340
Godfrey, I was just telling my daughters
you missed them while they were away.

1211
01:13:11,418 --> 01:13:13,511
Oh, yes, I did.
Very much, indeed.

1212
01:13:13,587 --> 01:13:16,215
- We missed you too, didn't we, Irene?
- Yes.

1213
01:13:16,290 --> 01:13:19,885
- I missed you, also.
- It's nice to miss everybody.

1214
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:22,724
Then it makes it so nice
when we get together again.

1215
01:13:22,796 --> 01:13:25,094
There, there, darling.
It's nice to see you cheerful.

1216
01:13:25,165 --> 01:13:27,895
- You do have a way with you, Godfrey.
- Thank you.

1217
01:13:27,968 --> 01:13:30,869
There's no use denying the fact
that Godfrey has a way with him.

1218
01:13:30,937 --> 01:13:33,906
We must be running on.
Cornelia, cheer her up.

1219
01:13:33,974 --> 01:13:35,908
I'm a cinch.

1220
01:13:35,976 --> 01:13:38,740
Do you feel better now that
you know Godfrey missed us?

1221
01:13:38,812 --> 01:13:41,713
He missed me more.
I could tell by the light in his eyes.

1222
01:13:41,782 --> 01:13:44,250
Why don't throw yourself
in the man's arms?

1223
01:13:44,318 --> 01:13:46,445
You can't rush a man
like Godfrey.

1224
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:48,715
You're getting
pretty old, you know?

1225
01:13:48,789 --> 01:13:51,724
He's really in love.
He's just hard to break down.

1226
01:13:51,792 --> 01:13:54,488
I could break him down
in no time at all.

1227
01:13:54,561 --> 01:13:56,995
- He'd have nothing to do with you.
- How do you know?

1228
01:13:57,064 --> 01:13:59,862
Because he wouldn't.
Don't you try anything.

1229
01:13:59,933 --> 01:14:02,902
I'm not saying I will,
and I'm not saying I won't

1230
01:14:02,969 --> 01:14:06,132
Come to think of it, Godfrey and
I have a little unfinished business.

1231
01:14:06,206 --> 01:14:10,336
You better leave it unfinished, unless
you want to be wearing a lamp for a hat.

1232
01:14:21,855 --> 01:14:24,688
Did you mean it
when you said you missed me?

1233
01:14:24,758 --> 01:14:27,226
Oh! Yes,
of course I did.

1234
01:14:27,294 --> 01:14:30,024
I mean, did you miss
Cornelia and me or just me?

1235
01:14:30,097 --> 01:14:33,032
- Well, I missed both of you.
- Not just me?

1236
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:36,263
Oh, I may have missed you a little
more than I did Cornelia. Why?

1237
01:14:36,336 --> 01:14:39,703
I'm glad, because if you missed Cornelia
more, you'd probably miss me less.

1238
01:14:39,773 --> 01:14:42,503
- That sounds very logical.
- That's all I wanted to know.

1239
01:14:42,576 --> 01:14:45,977
- You look so cute in your apron.
- I'm not trying to look cute.

1240
01:14:46,046 --> 01:14:48,981
Molly has a cold,
and I'm doubling for her.

1241
01:14:49,049 --> 01:14:51,643
What's funny about that?

1242
01:14:51,718 --> 01:14:53,845
- She hasn't got a cold.
- No?

1243
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:57,856
She's got the same thing I've got,
only you won't let me talk about that.

1244
01:14:57,924 --> 01:15:00,984
- You'll lose your temper.
- Well, not seriously.

1245
01:15:01,061 --> 01:15:04,360
- Will you let me do something?
- What do you want to do?

1246
01:15:04,431 --> 01:15:06,661
- Wipe.
- Oh, all right.

1247
01:15:06,733 --> 01:15:09,827
- You can tell me all about your trip.
- You won't get mad?

1248
01:15:09,903 --> 01:15:13,839
- Why should I?
- Because everybody was Godfrey.

1249
01:15:13,907 --> 01:15:16,842
Every... I don't want
to seem dull,

1250
01:15:16,910 --> 01:15:20,573
but I do seem to have a little trouble
following you at times.

1251
01:15:20,647 --> 01:15:23,309
Well, for instance, when I'd go
into a restaurant in Paris,

1252
01:15:23,383 --> 01:15:25,851
I'd close my eyes and say,
"The waiter is Godfrey.

1253
01:15:25,919 --> 01:15:27,978
I'm home, and he's
serving me dinner. "

1254
01:15:28,054 --> 01:15:30,750
- It made everything taste better.
- Why?

1255
01:15:30,824 --> 01:15:33,793
- Haven't you any sense?
- I'm afraid I haven't.

1256
01:15:33,860 --> 01:15:36,693
When I'd get in a cab,
the driver was Godfrey,

1257
01:15:36,763 --> 01:15:38,856
and I'd say,
"This is his chariot,

1258
01:15:38,932 --> 01:15:41,196
and he's taking me
to his castle on the mountains. "

1259
01:15:41,268 --> 01:15:45,364
Suppose you come down out of the
mountains and tell me about your trip.

1260
01:15:45,439 --> 01:15:49,637
We went to Venice, and I went for a ride
in one of those rowboats.

1261
01:15:49,709 --> 01:15:52,701
Not a matador. That was in Spain.
But something like a matador.

1262
01:15:52,779 --> 01:15:54,872
Do you, by any chance,
mean a gondolier?

1263
01:15:54,948 --> 01:15:58,384
That was the name of the boat. The man
that pushed it sang a beautiful song.

1264
01:15:58,452 --> 01:16:01,250
- It was beautiful.
- I see.

1265
01:16:01,321 --> 01:16:05,382
- So the man was Godfrey.
- I didn't even mind the smell.

1266
01:16:05,459 --> 01:16:09,623
It was very convenient to take a trip
abroad without leaving the kitchen.

1267
01:16:09,696 --> 01:16:12,460
Oh, you have a wonderful sense of humor.
I wish I had a sense of humor.

1268
01:16:12,532 --> 01:16:15,399
But I never can think
of the right thing to say.

1269
01:16:15,469 --> 01:16:19,371
Do you mind if I talk for a little bit,
while you catch your breath?

1270
01:16:19,439 --> 01:16:21,737
I'd love it.

1271
01:16:21,808 --> 01:16:25,403
While you've been away,
I've been doing some things also.

1272
01:16:25,479 --> 01:16:29,074
I've been trying to do things that
I thought would make you proud of me.

1273
01:16:29,149 --> 01:16:31,617
Oh, I was proud of you
before I went away.

1274
01:16:31,685 --> 01:16:34,153
Yes, but I mean
prouder still.

1275
01:16:34,221 --> 01:16:37,588
You see, you helped me
to find myself,

1276
01:16:37,657 --> 01:16:39,591
and I'm very grateful.

1277
01:16:39,659 --> 01:16:42,150
You'd make a wonderful husband.

1278
01:16:42,229 --> 01:16:44,220
I'm afraid not.

1279
01:16:44,297 --> 01:16:48,529
- I know how you feel about things.
- How?

1280
01:16:48,602 --> 01:16:52,663
Well, you're grateful to me because I
helped you to beat Cornelia,

1281
01:16:52,739 --> 01:16:56,971
and I'm grateful to you
because you helped me to beat life.

1282
01:16:57,043 --> 01:16:59,944
But that doesn't mean that
we have to fall in love.

1283
01:17:00,013 --> 01:17:03,141
If you don't want to,
but I'd make a wonderful wife.

1284
01:17:03,216 --> 01:17:06,014
Well, not for me,
I'm afraid.

1285
01:17:06,086 --> 01:17:08,987
You see, I like you very much.

1286
01:17:09,055 --> 01:17:12,456
But I had a very bitter experience.

1287
01:17:14,361 --> 01:17:16,295
But I won't bore you with that.

1288
01:17:16,363 --> 01:17:18,991
- Maybe she wasn't in love with you.
- Well, maybe not.

1289
01:17:19,065 --> 01:17:22,057
However, that's
beside the point.

1290
01:17:22,135 --> 01:17:24,695
You and I are friends.

1291
01:17:24,771 --> 01:17:27,706
I feel a certain
responsibility to you.

1292
01:17:27,774 --> 01:17:30,834
- That's why I wanted to tell you first.
- Tell me what?

1293
01:17:30,911 --> 01:17:35,348
Well, I thought it was about time
that I was moving on.

1294
01:17:35,415 --> 01:17:37,508
Godfrey!

1295
01:17:37,584 --> 01:17:40,144
Now, please.

1296
01:17:40,220 --> 01:17:42,814
- I won't cry, I promise.
- That's fine.

1297
01:17:42,889 --> 01:17:45,016
After all,
I'm your protege.

1298
01:17:45,091 --> 01:17:47,821
- You want me to improve myself?
- Yes.

1299
01:17:47,894 --> 01:17:50,988
You don't want me to go on being
just a butler all my life, do you?

1300
01:17:51,064 --> 01:17:54,261
- I want you to be anything you want.
- Well, that's very sweet.

1301
01:17:54,334 --> 01:17:57,565
- When are you leaving?
- Oh, pretty soon.

1302
01:17:57,637 --> 01:18:00,197
But I'll call you up
every now and then.

1303
01:18:00,273 --> 01:18:03,208
We'll have long chats.
I'll tell you how I'm getting on.

1304
01:18:03,276 --> 01:18:06,643
- Oh, we'll have lots of fun.
- Are you going back to her?

1305
01:18:06,713 --> 01:18:09,841
- To whom?
- That Indian woman.

1306
01:18:09,916 --> 01:18:12,680
Indian... Oh!

1307
01:18:12,752 --> 01:18:15,880
She was just
a fabrication.

1308
01:18:15,956 --> 01:18:19,414
Oh! Then, you weren't
married to her?

1309
01:18:19,492 --> 01:18:22,950
No, she was just a product
ofTommy Gray's imagination.

1310
01:18:23,029 --> 01:18:26,226
- Then there wasn't any?
- No!

1311
01:18:26,299 --> 01:18:29,063
Well, there couldn't
have been five children.

1312
01:18:29,135 --> 01:18:31,660
Well, naturally.

1313
01:18:31,738 --> 01:18:34,138
That makes a difference.

1314
01:18:36,876 --> 01:18:39,674
Yeah, that makes
a difference.

1315
01:18:41,948 --> 01:18:43,882
Did you ring, miss?

1316
01:18:43,950 --> 01:18:46,680
You needn't be so formal
when we're alone.

1317
01:18:46,753 --> 01:18:49,722
Shouldn't that rather increase
a butler's formality?

1318
01:18:49,789 --> 01:18:52,553
- But you're not a butler.
- I'm sorry if I've disappointed.

1319
01:18:52,626 --> 01:18:55,561
You might drop that superior
attitude for a moment.

1320
01:18:55,629 --> 01:18:58,860
There's a little matter I've wanted to
talk over with you for quite a while...

1321
01:18:58,932 --> 01:19:01,127
called "The Mystery
of Milady's Necklace"...

1322
01:19:01,201 --> 01:19:03,795
or "What Happened
to the Pearls?"

1323
01:19:03,870 --> 01:19:07,567
Pearls? Necklace? Oh, you mean the
one that disappeared last fall?

1324
01:19:07,641 --> 01:19:09,575
- The same.
- Didn't that ever turn up?

1325
01:19:09,643 --> 01:19:12,271
Oh, yes, it turned up,
but not in my possession.

1326
01:19:12,345 --> 01:19:16,179
I know the first part of the story, but
I wondered what you know might know?

1327
01:19:16,249 --> 01:19:19,707
- I can't imagine.
- One other story might interest you.

1328
01:19:19,786 --> 01:19:21,811
I met some people
on the boat coming over.

1329
01:19:21,888 --> 01:19:23,879
A Boston family,
quite distinguished.

1330
01:19:23,957 --> 01:19:27,688
They knew a great deal
about a family called... the Parkes.

1331
01:19:27,761 --> 01:19:30,252
<i>The old Mayflower crowd.
Very upper crust too.</i>

1332
01:19:30,330 --> 01:19:32,628
Never been a breath
of scandal.

1333
01:19:32,699 --> 01:19:36,601
<i>It would be an awful shame to see
them made the laughing stock of Boston.</i>

1334
01:19:36,670 --> 01:19:39,264
I should hate to see anyone
made a laughing stock.

1335
01:19:39,339 --> 01:19:42,638
Let's you and I take a long taxi ride
out Van Cortland Way.

1336
01:19:42,709 --> 01:19:44,973
<i>Perhaps we could
exchange secrets.</i>

1337
01:19:45,045 --> 01:19:48,071
- Is that a command?
- As you like.

1338
01:19:48,148 --> 01:19:50,981
I'll be waiting
around the corner.

1339
01:19:51,051 --> 01:19:55,112
Which corner?
This one or that one?

1340
01:19:55,188 --> 01:19:57,782
This corner.

1341
01:19:57,857 --> 01:20:00,826
It's impossible to exchange
intimate secrets here.

1342
01:20:00,894 --> 01:20:04,728
The traffic's almost as heavy as it is
at Grand Central Station.

1343
01:20:04,798 --> 01:20:08,063
Don't forget, darling.
Fifteen minutes.

1344
01:20:13,306 --> 01:20:16,639
Please, Godfrey,
you can't go with Cornelia.

1345
01:20:16,710 --> 01:20:19,474
But I didn't say I was going
anyplace with Miss Cornelia.

1346
01:20:19,546 --> 01:20:23,209
I know, but you will. She always
makes everybody do just as she likes.

1347
01:20:23,283 --> 01:20:26,218
But why should you care
whether I meet her or not?

1348
01:20:26,286 --> 01:20:30,086
I do care, that's why.
Cornelia's the one who doesn't care.

1349
01:20:30,156 --> 01:20:32,989
I think I should decide
those things for myself.

1350
01:20:33,059 --> 01:20:35,960
Oh, Godfrey, I don't want
to be annoying, but I... Oh!

1351
01:20:36,029 --> 01:20:40,398
Oh, see here...
You-You can't do that.

1352
01:20:40,467 --> 01:20:43,493
Uh, please, snap out of it.

1353
01:20:43,570 --> 01:20:48,337
Ohhh, this is
the craziest family.

1354
01:21:10,697 --> 01:21:14,292
Now see here, stop this nonsense.
Do you hear?

1355
01:21:14,367 --> 01:21:18,098
If you're faking one of your spells
to keep me from meeting Cornelia,

1356
01:21:18,171 --> 01:21:20,435
you're on the wrong track,
you hear?

1357
01:21:20,507 --> 01:21:22,441
- Do you hear?
- Mmm.

1358
01:21:26,546 --> 01:21:29,208
Must be some smelling salts.

1359
01:21:46,332 --> 01:21:49,233
Are you feeling better?
No?

1360
01:21:51,137 --> 01:21:53,765
Just a minute.

1361
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:57,139
Godfrey knows how to take care
of little Irene.

1362
01:21:57,210 --> 01:21:59,144
Yes, indeed.

1363
01:22:01,581 --> 01:22:05,677
Just lie there quietly, and Godfrey
will take care of everything.

1364
01:22:05,752 --> 01:22:09,051
Godfrey knows just how
to take care...

1365
01:22:09,122 --> 01:22:11,852
of these nasty old faints.

1366
01:22:11,925 --> 01:22:15,156
That's the girl.
Come right up here.

1367
01:22:15,228 --> 01:22:19,392
There you are.
Godfrey will soon fix Irene.

1368
01:22:19,465 --> 01:22:23,401
Yes, indeed.
Just leave everything to Godfrey.

1369
01:22:23,469 --> 01:22:26,233
Godfrey will take care
of everything.

1370
01:22:26,306 --> 01:22:29,673
Now, you just sit right down
there like a good girl,

1371
01:22:29,742 --> 01:22:33,041
and in just a minute
you'll forget that you had any trouble.

1372
01:22:33,112 --> 01:22:36,172
I thought so. Let that be a lesson.

1373
01:22:36,249 --> 01:22:39,218
Godrey! Oh, Godfrey,
don't go away!

1374
01:22:39,285 --> 01:22:42,311
Oh, Godfrey,
now I know you love me.

1375
01:22:42,388 --> 01:22:45,551
- I do not love you!
- You do!

1376
01:22:45,625 --> 01:22:48,059
What is the meaning of this,
may I ask?

1377
01:22:48,127 --> 01:22:51,153
- Godfrey loves me!
- What are you talking about?

1378
01:22:51,231 --> 01:22:54,200
- Godfrey loves me!
- Godfrey, I demand an explanation!

1379
01:22:54,267 --> 01:22:58,033
- I think perhaps I had better resign.
- Yes, that's a good idea.

1380
01:22:58,104 --> 01:23:02,040
- What do you think your father'd say?
- I don't care. Godfrey loves me.

1381
01:23:02,108 --> 01:23:05,077
You put on some dry clothes
and come downstairs.

1382
01:23:05,144 --> 01:23:08,580
- Godfrey loves me!
- I never heard anything like this!

1383
01:23:29,235 --> 01:23:33,365
Shut that thing off!
I feel gloomy enough as it is!

1384
01:23:41,614 --> 01:23:44,139
- Something terrible has happened.
- What?

1385
01:23:44,217 --> 01:23:47,118
- Godfrey pushed Irene into a shower.
- What's terrible about that?

1386
01:23:47,186 --> 01:23:50,178
He's in love with her. I can't make
head nor tail out of the whole thing.

1387
01:23:50,256 --> 01:23:52,850
I can't make head nor tail
out of what you're saying.

1388
01:23:52,926 --> 01:23:55,190
The only thing is to send
him back where he came from.

1389
01:23:55,261 --> 01:23:57,525
Imagine, falling in love
with a butler.

1390
01:23:57,597 --> 01:24:00,532
If you're going to feel sorry
for anyone, feel sorry for Godfrey.

1391
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:04,263
- Alexander!
- Don't "Alexander" me!

1392
01:24:04,337 --> 01:24:06,635
I've got something
more important to talk about.

1393
01:24:06,706 --> 01:24:09,470
Don't tell me you're going
to talk about money matters.

1394
01:24:09,542 --> 01:24:12,204
- Money, money, money!
- Yes, I am. But before I start,

1395
01:24:12,278 --> 01:24:14,769
I'm going to have
a little talk with Carlo.

1396
01:24:14,847 --> 01:24:18,943
- What are you going to do?
- This is private, just for Carlo's ears.

1397
01:24:20,553 --> 01:24:24,148
You don't mind if we have
a little chat, Carlo, old boy?

1398
01:24:24,223 --> 01:24:27,750
You know, for some time,
Carlo, I've felt...

1399
01:24:33,466 --> 01:24:36,492
- What did you say to Carlo?
- I said good-bye.

1400
01:24:36,569 --> 01:24:39,504
- Did he go?
- He left through the side window.

1401
01:24:39,572 --> 01:24:41,938
<i>- Where is he going?
- I don't know, but he won't be back.</i>

1402
01:24:42,008 --> 01:24:44,943
- Now, sit down and do some listening.
- I've never seen you like this.

1403
01:24:45,011 --> 01:24:47,241
Sit down!
What's come over you?

1404
01:24:47,313 --> 01:24:50,646
- You're just in time to listen.
- Do you want Godfrey to listen?

1405
01:24:50,717 --> 01:24:53,811
Yes, I want Godfrey to listen.
This concerns him too.

1406
01:24:53,886 --> 01:24:57,253
You might as well all know,
point-blank, we're about broke.

1407
01:24:57,323 --> 01:24:59,416
You mean we haven't
any money left?

1408
01:24:59,492 --> 01:25:02,552
We've got this house, a few odds
and ends, and that's about all.

1409
01:25:02,628 --> 01:25:05,654
Not only that, I've lost all of my stock
in Bullock Enterprises.

1410
01:25:05,732 --> 01:25:09,133
<i>I've borrowed some of the stockholder's
money trying to recoup my losses.</i>

1411
01:25:09,202 --> 01:25:12,137
I don't know where I'm going to end up.
Maybe in jail.

1412
01:25:12,205 --> 01:25:14,799
- Alexander!
- But if I do end up in jail,

1413
01:25:14,874 --> 01:25:17,502
it'll be the first peace
I've had in 20 years.

1414
01:25:17,577 --> 01:25:19,943
And I don't want any of you
to chortle about Godfrey.

1415
01:25:20,013 --> 01:25:21,947
You may all end up on the dump.

1416
01:25:22,015 --> 01:25:25,041
<i>- What are we going to do?
- May I intrude, sir?</i>

1417
01:25:25,118 --> 01:25:28,212
I'm afraid things are not
as bad as you make out.

1418
01:25:28,287 --> 01:25:30,778
- What do you know about it?
- Well, sir,

1419
01:25:30,857 --> 01:25:34,987
I've known for a long time the Bullock
interests were in rather a bad way.

1420
01:25:35,061 --> 01:25:37,962
I offered to help you once,
but you declined that help.

1421
01:25:38,031 --> 01:25:42,468
So I took the liberty of dabbling in the
market on my own account. Here, sir.

1422
01:25:42,535 --> 01:25:45,163
<i>- What's this?
- That's most of your stock.</i>

1423
01:25:45,238 --> 01:25:48,230
I knew it had been dumped
on the market, so I sold short.

1424
01:25:48,307 --> 01:25:51,765
I don't understand. You sold short.
You mean gentlemen's underwear?

1425
01:25:51,844 --> 01:25:55,871
Wait! You mean that you've been making
money while I was losing it?

1426
01:25:55,948 --> 01:25:59,475
I did it in your interest, sir.
The stock has been endorsed over to you.

1427
01:26:01,387 --> 01:26:05,619
I don't understand.
You did this for me?

1428
01:26:05,691 --> 01:26:09,525
Well, sir, there comes a turning point
in every man's life.

1429
01:26:09,595 --> 01:26:13,087
A time when he needs help.
It happened to me, also.

1430
01:26:13,166 --> 01:26:17,000
This family helped me
I hope I repaid my debt.

1431
01:26:17,070 --> 01:26:21,029
Some of the money went into a project
of my own. I hope you won't mind.

1432
01:26:21,107 --> 01:26:24,304
Do you mean that you did
all that on $150 a month?

1433
01:26:24,377 --> 01:26:28,211
Well, hardly. You see,
with the aid ofTommy Gray,

1434
01:26:28,281 --> 01:26:32,718
I was able to transmute
a certain trinket into gold,

1435
01:26:32,785 --> 01:26:36,186
then into stock
and then back into pearls again.

1436
01:26:36,255 --> 01:26:39,019
Thank you, dear lady,
for the use of this trinket.

1437
01:26:39,092 --> 01:26:41,856
Oh, Godfrey!
Then you did steal them!

1438
01:26:41,928 --> 01:26:45,921
Well, I, uh... Perhaps Miss Cornelia
had better explain that.

1439
01:26:45,998 --> 01:26:49,434
- You win.
- What is this all about, anyway?

1440
01:26:49,502 --> 01:26:52,562
I put the pearls
under Godfrey's mattress.

1441
01:26:52,638 --> 01:26:55,198
Thank you, Miss Cornelia.
I wanted you to say that.

1442
01:26:55,274 --> 01:26:58,266
<i>- But why?
- You wouldn't understand.</i>

1443
01:26:58,344 --> 01:27:00,938
Here, Godfrey.
These are rightfully yours.

1444
01:27:01,013 --> 01:27:04,642
Oh, no, thank you. I repaid my debt,
and I'm grateful to all of you.

1445
01:27:04,717 --> 01:27:07,948
If anyone's indebted, we are, after
the way some of us have treated you.

1446
01:27:08,020 --> 01:27:12,889
I've been repaid in many ways.
I learned patience from Mr. Bullock.

1447
01:27:12,959 --> 01:27:17,089
I found Mrs. Bullock
at all times, shall we say, amusing.

1448
01:27:17,163 --> 01:27:21,600
That's complimentary, and don't forget
you said I looked as young as Cornelia.

1449
01:27:21,667 --> 01:27:25,501
- What good did you find in me, if any?
- A great deal.

1450
01:27:25,571 --> 01:27:29,507
You taught me the fallacy of
false pride. You taught me humility.

1451
01:27:29,575 --> 01:27:32,601
I don't understand you.

1452
01:27:32,678 --> 01:27:36,512
Miss Cornelia, there have been other
spoiled children in the world.

1453
01:27:36,582 --> 01:27:39,312
I happened to be
one of them myself.

1454
01:27:39,385 --> 01:27:41,580
You're a high-spirited girl.

1455
01:27:41,654 --> 01:27:46,091
I can only hope that you use those
high spirits in a more constructive way.

1456
01:27:46,159 --> 01:27:49,856
And so... good day.

1457
01:28:02,842 --> 01:28:05,208
You know,
I hate to see Godfrey go.

1458
01:28:05,278 --> 01:28:08,372
He's the only butler we ever had
who understood women.

1459
01:28:11,184 --> 01:28:14,585
Well, Molly, you told me to leave
my hat near the door. Remember?

1460
01:28:14,654 --> 01:28:17,020
I hate to see you leave,
Godfrey.

1461
01:28:17,089 --> 01:28:20,786
- Oh, Molly, you've been swell.
- The house will seem empty.

1462
01:28:20,860 --> 01:28:24,921
Well, I guess the best
friends have to part.

1463
01:28:24,997 --> 01:28:27,693
Will you say good-bye
to Miss Irene for me?

1464
01:28:27,767 --> 01:28:30,930
I don't think I can go through
that ordeal right now.

1465
01:28:32,672 --> 01:28:35,732
You're sweet, Molly.

1466
01:28:35,808 --> 01:28:37,742
Good-bye.

1467
01:28:47,220 --> 01:28:49,916
What is it?

1468
01:28:49,989 --> 01:28:53,652
What's the matter
with Cornelia?

1469
01:28:57,863 --> 01:29:01,094
What's the matter with everybody?
Mother, what's the trouble?

1470
01:29:01,167 --> 01:29:03,192
- He's gone.
- Who's gone?

1471
01:29:03,269 --> 01:29:05,328
- Godfrey.
- Where?

1472
01:29:05,404 --> 01:29:08,100
And Carlo's gone out of the window.
Everybody's gone!

1473
01:29:08,174 --> 01:29:11,007
Oh, Molly, has he gone?

1474
01:29:11,077 --> 01:29:13,807
Poor Molly.
He's not gonna get away from me.

1475
01:29:13,879 --> 01:29:16,347
Order the car, Molly.
I'll be right down.

1476
01:29:23,256 --> 01:29:25,816
- Hello, Duke.
- Hi, Mike.

1477
01:29:25,891 --> 01:29:28,587
Say, business
looks pretty good tonight.

1478
01:29:28,661 --> 01:29:32,119
I'll say it is. Mayor Courtney's
here tonight with a big party.

1479
01:29:32,198 --> 01:29:35,634
I'll have one of the boys
bring these down, Duke.

1480
01:29:42,475 --> 01:29:45,842
- Hello, Duke.
- Hello. We can't complain about this.

1481
01:29:45,911 --> 01:29:48,436
Complain? Why, we got
the Meriwethers here!

1482
01:29:48,514 --> 01:29:51,677
- So I heard.
- Big stuff, huh?

1483
01:29:51,751 --> 01:29:53,981
This is all Greek to me.

1484
01:29:54,053 --> 01:29:56,647
Oh, here's our wandering butler now.
Explain it to him.

1485
01:29:56,722 --> 01:29:58,656
- Hello, Duke.
- Arthur.

1486
01:29:58,724 --> 01:30:01,989
I've got an estimate from the contractor
on your housing plan for the winter.

1487
01:30:02,061 --> 01:30:06,395
He figures he can petition off
our present buildings into compartments,

1488
01:30:06,465 --> 01:30:08,626
take care of
at least 50 people.

1489
01:30:08,701 --> 01:30:11,864
It'll cost $5,800,
but that includes steam heat.

1490
01:30:11,937 --> 01:30:15,429
Forgotten men with steam. Sounds like
something that ought to be on the menu.

1491
01:30:15,508 --> 01:30:18,341
I'll talk with you
about it later, Arthur.

1492
01:30:18,411 --> 01:30:22,006
I've still got an interest in this
company. When do you pay dividends?

1493
01:30:22,081 --> 01:30:26,313
We're giving food and shelter to 50
in the winter and employment in summer.

1494
01:30:26,385 --> 01:30:29,752
- What more do you want?
- You're the most arbitrary butler ever.

1495
01:30:29,822 --> 01:30:31,756
- Ex-butler.
- Fired?

1496
01:30:31,824 --> 01:30:35,760
I quit. I felt that
foolish feeling coming on again.

1497
01:30:35,828 --> 01:30:38,820
- You mean Irene?
- What do you know about that?

1498
01:30:38,898 --> 01:30:42,595
Nobody knows anything about her love,
except all of Upper New York.

1499
01:30:42,668 --> 01:30:44,727
Guess I got out
just in time.

1500
01:30:44,804 --> 01:30:47,034
Why don't you marry
the girl?

1501
01:30:47,106 --> 01:30:50,132
- I've had enough of matrimony.
- What's wrong with butlers?

1502
01:30:50,209 --> 01:30:53,042
Lots of society girls
run away with their chauffeurs.

1503
01:30:53,112 --> 01:30:56,639
Never mind about that. Suppose
you write me out a check for $5,000?

1504
01:30:56,716 --> 01:30:58,980
- For what?
- A new dock.

1505
01:30:59,051 --> 01:31:01,542
Perhaps we'll get
some of the yachting trade.

1506
01:31:01,620 --> 01:31:03,713
Well, how about
an airplane landing?

1507
01:31:03,789 --> 01:31:06,553
We'll come to that later.

1508
01:31:15,701 --> 01:31:18,636
Say, mister, what happened
to the city dump that was here?

1509
01:31:18,704 --> 01:31:21,468
Well, this is it, but
most of it's been filled in.

1510
01:31:21,540 --> 01:31:24,668
- What happened to those forgotten men?
- Forgotten men?

1511
01:31:24,744 --> 01:31:28,510
- Oh, we got most of them out in time.
- Where's Godfrey?

1512
01:31:28,581 --> 01:31:31,175
- You mean Mr. Godfrey Smith?
- Yes.

1513
01:31:31,250 --> 01:31:34,686
Well, lady, his office is right over
there where it says "office. "

1514
01:31:34,754 --> 01:31:38,315
Oh, just where it used to be.
Thank you. Come on, Clarence.

1515
01:31:38,391 --> 01:31:41,588
Say, wait a minute!
What is this? A basket party?

1516
01:31:45,398 --> 01:31:47,992
- Good evening, Mr. Courtney.
- Good evening.

1517
01:31:48,067 --> 01:31:50,331
- Lovely evening.
- Yes.

1518
01:31:50,403 --> 01:31:52,530
Good evening.

1519
01:31:52,605 --> 01:31:55,904
Well, there you are.
Business is fine.

1520
01:31:55,975 --> 01:32:00,674
I'm stuck, you're nuts,
and I'm going back to Boston
before I disgrace my family.

1521
01:32:00,746 --> 01:32:04,682
- Good riddance.
- Oh, Godfrey, company has come.

1522
01:32:04,750 --> 01:32:08,117
<i>- Hello.
- What are you doing here?</i>

1523
01:32:08,187 --> 01:32:11,088
Yes, what are you doing here?
Don't let him off the hook.

1524
01:32:11,157 --> 01:32:13,717
You must leave at once.
Do you hear me?

1525
01:32:13,793 --> 01:32:18,958
We got rid of her. If I can help
you in any other way, let me know.

1526
01:32:19,031 --> 01:32:22,967
Oh, my, how you've
fixed this place up, Godfrey.

1527
01:32:23,035 --> 01:32:26,630
- It's much nicer than before.
- Oh, you noticed that?

1528
01:32:26,705 --> 01:32:30,072
- Are the forgotten men having a party?
- It's their annual reunion.

1529
01:32:30,142 --> 01:32:33,839
- I saw the mayor. Is he one too?
- He's the guest of honor.

1530
01:32:33,913 --> 01:32:37,007
Oh, it's a lovely view.

1531
01:32:37,082 --> 01:32:40,518
- The bridge is always there?
- Most always.

1532
01:32:40,586 --> 01:32:43,612
Oh, you have a kitchen!
I'm gonna like this place.

1533
01:32:43,689 --> 01:32:46,590
What's over here?
Oh, is this where you sleep?

1534
01:32:46,659 --> 01:32:50,891
That's the general purpose
of the room. Any observations?

1535
01:32:50,963 --> 01:32:54,330
I think it's very cute,
but we'll have to change the wallpaper.

1536
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:57,369
- What do you mean "we"?
- Oh, I don't like green wallpaper.

1537
01:32:57,436 --> 01:33:00,462
You won't have to look at it.
You're going home right now.

1538
01:33:00,539 --> 01:33:02,734
- Oh, but I can't go home.
- Why not?

1539
01:33:02,808 --> 01:33:06,107
- I can't go home after what happened.
- What happened?

1540
01:33:06,178 --> 01:33:09,011
You know what happened
just as well as I do.

1541
01:33:09,081 --> 01:33:12,414
- Now see here...
- Oh, go on and lose your temper.

1542
01:33:12,485 --> 01:33:14,919
I love it when
you lose your temper.

1543
01:33:14,987 --> 01:33:16,921
Why can't you let me alone?

1544
01:33:16,989 --> 01:33:20,254
Because you're my responsibility,
and someone has to take care of you.

1545
01:33:20,326 --> 01:33:23,955
- I can take care of myself.
- Look me in the eye and say that.

1546
01:33:24,029 --> 01:33:26,293
You love me,
and you know it.

1547
01:33:26,365 --> 01:33:29,334
There's no sense in struggling against
a thing when it's got you.

1548
01:33:29,401 --> 01:33:30,925
<i>That's all there is to it.</i>

1549
01:33:31,003 --> 01:33:32,937
Oh, that's Clarence.

1550
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:37,331
I'm sorry I was delayed,
Miss Irene.

1551
01:33:37,409 --> 01:33:39,934
<i>- I had to go around the back way.
- Put the wood over there.</i>

1552
01:33:40,012 --> 01:33:43,311
You can put the groceries
right there in the kitchen.

1553
01:33:43,382 --> 01:33:46,112
- That's fine. Thank you, Clarence.
- What's the idea?

1554
01:33:46,185 --> 01:33:49,279
I brought some wood and food.
It should last us for a week.

1555
01:33:49,355 --> 01:33:52,813
It's a wonder you didn't bring
a minister and license.

1556
01:33:52,892 --> 01:33:55,122
<i>I never thought of that.</i>

1557
01:33:55,194 --> 01:33:57,287
- May I come in?
- Oh, Mr. Courtney.

1558
01:33:57,363 --> 01:34:01,163
Mr. Gray said there were a couple of
people here who wanted to get married.

1559
01:34:01,233 --> 01:34:04,896
- Are you it?
- Can you marry us without a license?

1560
01:34:04,970 --> 01:34:07,200
It may get me
into a lot of trouble,

1561
01:34:07,273 --> 01:34:09,707
but I guess I've known
your family long enough.

1562
01:34:09,775 --> 01:34:12,801
- Who are you going to marry?
- Godfrey. This is Godfrey.

1563
01:34:12,878 --> 01:34:16,746
Oh. How do you do, Godfrey?

1564
01:34:16,815 --> 01:34:19,215
Does your father
know about this?

1565
01:34:19,285 --> 01:34:21,981
Everybody knows about it
except Godfrey.

1566
01:34:22,054 --> 01:34:24,887
Well, I guess we better
have a witness.

1567
01:34:24,957 --> 01:34:28,324
- Clarence, stand right down here.
- What?

1568
01:34:28,394 --> 01:34:32,160
That's fine. Right there.
Come on, Godfrey. Right there.

1569
01:34:32,231 --> 01:34:35,530
Well, now, uh,
join hands, please.

1570
01:34:35,601 --> 01:34:38,263
- No, the right hand.
- Oh.

1571
01:34:38,337 --> 01:34:41,272
Stand still, Godfrey.
It'll all be over in a minute.
