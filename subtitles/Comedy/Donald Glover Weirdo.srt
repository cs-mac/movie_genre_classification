1
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:17,259
Set dresser to the stage.

2
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,888
Check lights.

3
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:20,778
With my narrator?

4
00:00:24,582 --> 00:00:27,084
Singing, singing, singing,
singing all day long

5
00:00:27,023 --> 00:00:29,526
When I'm singing, there is
nothing that is wrong

6
00:00:37,067 --> 00:00:38,485
Talent to the set, please.

7
00:00:38,468 --> 00:00:39,886
We're live in sixty seconds.

8
00:00:39,868 --> 00:00:41,161
Sixty seconds!

9
00:00:41,148 --> 00:00:42,441
Where's the narrator?

10
00:00:42,429 --> 00:00:45,348
Monsieur Narrator.
Monsieur Narrator!

11
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,522
M-m-monsieur!
Monsieur, it is time!

12
00:00:50,752 --> 00:00:52,837
Monsieur.
Pardonnez-moi.

13
00:00:52,793 --> 00:00:55,963
But today is the day,
right, monsieur?

14
00:00:55,874 --> 00:00:58,418
Because you promised
I can sing my songs...

15
00:00:58,354 --> 00:01:00,231
about the musketeers,
right?

16
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:02,812
All for one...

17
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:13,606
But, monsieur,
you promised.

18
00:01:13,481 --> 00:01:15,191
Oh, no, no.

19
00:01:15,161 --> 00:01:16,454
No, no, no.
Monsieur. Monsieur.

20
00:01:16,442 --> 00:01:17,651
Monsieur, wait!
Wait!

21
00:01:17,642 --> 00:01:19,185
The stage is...

22
00:01:19,163 --> 00:01:20,622
This way.

23
00:01:20,603 --> 00:01:23,106
Let's have some quiet, people.

24
00:01:23,044 --> 00:01:25,880
Five seconds to air.

25
00:01:25,805 --> 00:01:28,391
Cue music. And... action!

26
00:01:28,326 --> 00:01:29,827
What's that turtle doing?

27
00:01:29,807 --> 00:01:31,308
Where's the narrator?

28
00:01:31,287 --> 00:01:33,623
We're live.
Just go with it.

29
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:36,530
Hey, you. Don't just
sit there like a turtle.

30
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,201
Do something!

31
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:39,797
You're on camera!

32
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:41,731
For crying out loud,
say something!

33
00:01:43,171 --> 00:01:45,132
Allo.

34
00:01:45,092 --> 00:01:47,345
Tell the story.

35
00:01:50,054 --> 00:01:53,182
Today, I will tell you
the story of...

36
00:01:55,096 --> 00:01:57,599
"The Three Musketeers"!

37
00:01:57,538 --> 00:02:01,917
This is my favourite version...
the one with pictures.

38
00:02:01,779 --> 00:02:05,324
And, of course, my songs.

39
00:02:05,221 --> 00:02:08,515
Our story begins...

40
00:02:08,421 --> 00:02:11,049
in the gutter...

41
00:02:10,983 --> 00:02:15,445
where poor young street urchins
Mickey, Donald, and Goofy...

42
00:02:15,304 --> 00:02:17,264
struggled to survive.

43
00:02:17,225 --> 00:02:20,353
Zut alors! Bad guys.

44
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:22,560
Will anyone defend
these innocent children?

45
00:02:22,506 --> 00:02:25,926
Anyone! Anyone! Anyone!

46
00:02:25,828 --> 00:02:27,580
Well, anyone?

47
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:31,170
The royal musketeers!

48
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,861
Yes!

49
00:02:32,831 --> 00:02:34,958
And after
the dust settles...

50
00:02:34,912 --> 00:02:39,083
a kindly musketeer
gives Mickey a gift.

51
00:02:38,953 --> 00:02:43,249
Don't worry, Mickey.
You'll grow into it.

52
00:02:43,114 --> 00:02:46,576
From that day on,
Mickey, Donald, and Goofy...

53
00:02:46,476 --> 00:02:49,437
dreamed of being
great musketeers.

54
00:02:49,356 --> 00:02:51,817
But as the years passed...

55
00:02:51,758 --> 00:02:55,220
their dream was still
as far away as ever.

56
00:02:55,119 --> 00:02:58,081
You see, before
their dream can come true...

57
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,045
our three heroes must learn
the real meaning...

58
00:03:02,562 --> 00:03:05,690
of the musketeer creed...
all for one and one for all!

59
00:03:05,683 --> 00:03:09,479
And I just happen to have
a song about this!

60
00:03:11,085 --> 00:03:12,712
All for one, hey!

61
00:03:12,685 --> 00:03:14,395
All for one
and one for all

62
00:03:14,366 --> 00:03:15,993
Musketeers sing

63
00:03:15,967 --> 00:03:17,844
All for one
and one for all

64
00:03:17,808 --> 00:03:19,560
If you dare to

65
00:03:19,528 --> 00:03:21,197
Cross our path,
prepare to fall

66
00:03:21,169 --> 00:03:22,838
'Cause we'll fight you

67
00:03:22,809 --> 00:03:24,686
All for one
and one for all

68
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,569
And all for one
and one for all

69
00:03:26,531 --> 00:03:29,534
And all for one and all

70
00:03:29,452 --> 00:03:32,413
So, if you think
you'd care to

71
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:34,377
Kick some derriere, you

72
00:03:34,334 --> 00:03:37,129
Know that as a musketeer,
you'd be so fearsome

73
00:03:37,054 --> 00:03:39,307
If you believe you're manly

74
00:03:39,255 --> 00:03:41,299
Come and join
our family

75
00:03:41,257 --> 00:03:44,593
Soon we'll make sure
you're a musketeer

76
00:03:44,498 --> 00:03:46,458
Look at them, fellas.

77
00:03:46,418 --> 00:03:49,129
That's gonna be us
out there someday.

78
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,812
I just know it.

79
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,365
I can't wait.

80
00:03:52,341 --> 00:03:54,885
Yeah. Me, too.

81
00:03:54,822 --> 00:03:58,033
All for one, all men of honour,
hear my call

82
00:03:57,943 --> 00:04:01,405
Musketeers sing
all for one and one for all

83
00:04:01,304 --> 00:04:04,683
All for one, hey,
all for one and one for all

84
00:04:04,586 --> 00:04:07,630
All for one and all for one
and one for all

85
00:04:07,546 --> 00:04:09,673
And all for one
and one for all

86
00:04:09,627 --> 00:04:13,923
And all for one and all

87
00:04:13,788 --> 00:04:16,916
All for one and one for all!

88
00:04:24,233 --> 00:04:29,113
Yes, sir. Janitors today,
musketeers tomorrow.

89
00:04:31,515 --> 00:04:33,475
Hey, my lucky musketeer hat.

90
00:04:33,436 --> 00:04:34,979
Oh, thanks, boy.

91
00:04:36,157 --> 00:04:39,285
Remember when the musketeers
gave me this hat, Pluto?

92
00:04:39,198 --> 00:04:41,033
They even autographed it. See?

93
00:04:44,721 --> 00:04:46,848
I can't wait to be
a great big hero.

94
00:04:46,801 --> 00:04:48,511
Careful, Goofy.

95
00:04:48,482 --> 00:04:50,693
Sorry, Mickey.

96
00:04:50,642 --> 00:04:53,270
I can't wait to be
a musketeer, neither...

97
00:04:53,204 --> 00:04:56,082
'cause I got
plenty of good ideas.

98
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:59,299
The musketeers can use
a clever fella like me.

99
00:05:00,806 --> 00:05:01,891
Yipe!

100
00:05:01,887 --> 00:05:03,681
Hey, Donald, how about you?

101
00:05:03,648 --> 00:05:05,232
Are you kidding?

102
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:09,337
Musketeers need guys like me
that are brave!

103
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:11,712
Yeah, and they need guys
that are brave, too.

104
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:14,820
That's what I said...
brave.

105
00:05:28,817 --> 00:05:32,070
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Yes, sirree.

106
00:05:31,978 --> 00:05:35,773
I've been looking forward
to this all month.

107
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,954
Maybe I can sand it out.

108
00:06:05,831 --> 00:06:07,374
Almost...

109
00:06:19,716 --> 00:06:24,888
A... I'm adorable,
B... I'm so beautiful

110
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,053
What?

111
00:06:35,882 --> 00:06:38,427
Almost... got it.

112
00:06:42,165 --> 00:06:44,417
I got it!

113
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,820
Goofy, look out!

114
00:07:12,577 --> 00:07:14,078
Captain Pete.

115
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,281
Now listen, you yardsticks.

116
00:07:24,221 --> 00:07:27,766
I am sick and tired
of your screw-ups.

117
00:07:27,662 --> 00:07:29,789
You guys are hopeless.
I leave you for five minutes...

118
00:07:29,742 --> 00:07:32,453
and I come back
to a disaster!

119
00:07:32,384 --> 00:07:34,303
Well, we were
practising our teamwork...

120
00:07:34,264 --> 00:07:36,225
so we can be
good musketeers.

121
00:07:36,185 --> 00:07:38,646
Musketeers?

122
00:07:52,712 --> 00:07:56,257
That's priceless.

123
00:07:56,153 --> 00:07:58,322
But we could work really hard...

124
00:07:58,273 --> 00:08:00,234
and prove ourselves,
Captain Pete...

125
00:08:00,194 --> 00:08:03,447
and then would you
let us be musketeers?

126
00:08:03,355 --> 00:08:06,233
Well, there's three things
wrong with that.

127
00:08:06,157 --> 00:08:07,450
One...

128
00:08:10,718 --> 00:08:12,220
You're a coward.

129
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:13,408
Two...

130
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,632
We're sorry.

131
00:08:16,601 --> 00:08:18,728
The number you've reached
has been disconnected.

132
00:08:18,681 --> 00:08:20,850
You're a doofus.

133
00:08:20,802 --> 00:08:29,435
And, as for you...
well, you're just too small.

134
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:31,961
Why, I wouldn't have
you yahoos as musketeers...

135
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,846
even if you were
the last recruits...

136
00:08:33,807 --> 00:08:36,768
in all
of my beloved France!

137
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:44,937
So, you won't
need this, will you?

138
00:08:44,811 --> 00:08:46,771
Yeah.

139
00:08:46,732 --> 00:08:51,153
Here, kid. Have a ball.

140
00:08:51,013 --> 00:08:53,432
Have a ball!
That's a good one!

141
00:08:53,374 --> 00:08:56,711
I'm going to send
that one in to the Digest.

142
00:09:13,582 --> 00:09:16,376
He loves me.

143
00:09:16,303 --> 00:09:18,263
He loves me... a lot.

144
00:09:19,504 --> 00:09:21,131
He loves me.

145
00:09:22,226 --> 00:09:24,019
He loves me even more.

146
00:09:25,266 --> 00:09:26,726
He loves me.

147
00:09:26,707 --> 00:09:29,668
Pardon me, Your Highness...

148
00:09:29,588 --> 00:09:32,549
you're kind of mangling
that flower.

149
00:09:32,469 --> 00:09:34,763
Who's the... lucky guy?

150
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:37,087
My one true love.

151
00:09:38,512 --> 00:09:40,472
I'll find him someday.

152
00:09:40,432 --> 00:09:43,226
He's out there.
I just know it.

153
00:09:43,153 --> 00:09:44,613
This fantasy man...

154
00:09:44,593 --> 00:09:46,804
do you happen to know
if he's royalty?

155
00:09:46,755 --> 00:09:48,673
Does it matter?

156
00:09:48,635 --> 00:09:50,595
Well, as you know...

157
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:54,518
someone of your royal stature
must be courted...

158
00:09:54,398 --> 00:09:56,692
by a gentleman
of royal blood.

159
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:58,474
What a royal pain.

160
00:09:58,439 --> 00:10:00,483
Your highness,
you're gonna have...

161
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,567
to pick someone
sooner or later.

162
00:10:02,521 --> 00:10:04,481
I mean, tick-tock, huh?

163
00:10:04,442 --> 00:10:07,778
Daisy, I can't pick someone
I'm not in love with.

164
00:10:07,682 --> 00:10:10,351
You want love? Buy a dog.

165
00:10:10,283 --> 00:10:11,659
Besides, the perfect guy...

166
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:13,604
isn't gonna just walk
through the door...

167
00:10:13,565 --> 00:10:15,025
and even if he does...

168
00:10:15,005 --> 00:10:17,466
how are you gonna know
he's the one?

169
00:10:17,406 --> 00:10:19,241
I'll know.

170
00:10:19,207 --> 00:10:21,918
Just imagine.
He'll stride into the room.

171
00:10:21,848 --> 00:10:24,976
A light will glow from him.

172
00:10:24,889 --> 00:10:28,059
I'll hear music.
He'll bring me flowers.

173
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:30,431
He'll sweep me off my feet.

174
00:10:30,371 --> 00:10:36,628
And I'll know he's the one
when he makes me laugh.

175
00:10:36,413 --> 00:10:40,376
Your majesty,
forgive me for saying so...

176
00:10:40,254 --> 00:10:41,589
but that sounds...

177
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:47,627
just lovely.

178
00:10:50,778 --> 00:10:52,947
Trust me, Daisy.

179
00:10:52,899 --> 00:10:55,693
I'll know him when I see him.

180
00:11:12,107 --> 00:11:14,234
Why... bonjour.

181
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:23,272
A romantic princess
deserves a romantic song, no?

182
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:26,572
Just around the corner,
seeking you

183
00:11:26,472 --> 00:11:30,434
Puppy love is tripping
lightly into view

184
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:31,899
Hiding in the hedgerows

185
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:33,835
Sneaking up on tiptoes

186
00:11:33,795 --> 00:11:35,838
Love's first kiss
is blissfully

187
00:11:35,796 --> 00:11:38,257
About to capture you

188
00:11:38,196 --> 00:11:41,950
Just around the corner,
wafting close

189
00:11:41,838 --> 00:11:45,258
Love is creeping nearer
than you might suppose

190
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,120
So sit still
and wait now

191
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,082
Let love
choose your fate now

192
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,959
Take a pause,
don't run because

193
00:11:50,922 --> 00:11:52,590
It's right behind you

194
00:11:52,562 --> 00:11:54,230
Let love find you

195
00:11:54,203 --> 00:11:56,413
Young love

196
00:11:56,364 --> 00:12:00,159
It's love, love,
love, love, love

197
00:12:00,045 --> 00:12:03,340
Love so lovely

198
00:12:03,246 --> 00:12:07,625
What can you say to love

199
00:12:07,488 --> 00:12:10,908
But love?

200
00:12:18,412 --> 00:12:22,541
Maybe on the rooftops,
climbing high

201
00:12:22,413 --> 00:12:26,083
Somewhere just above you,
love is hovering by

202
00:12:25,975 --> 00:12:28,102
Love is in a rush to

203
00:12:28,056 --> 00:12:29,891
Smear you, smash you,
smush you

204
00:12:29,856 --> 00:12:32,025
Love will crush you
into mush

205
00:12:31,977 --> 00:12:34,897
When you're the bull's-eye,
you'll get hit by

206
00:12:34,818 --> 00:12:36,862
Young love

207
00:12:36,819 --> 00:12:40,697
Your first,
your only love

208
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,123
Love so...

209
00:12:42,101 --> 00:12:44,061
Excuse me. Your Grace?

210
00:12:44,021 --> 00:12:46,315
How can
you stand it so...

211
00:12:47,383 --> 00:12:49,802
Your Highness!

212
00:12:58,667 --> 00:13:01,003
Who's gonna tell
the bloomin' boss the bad news?

213
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:02,908
Don't look at me.
I ain't saying nothing.

214
00:13:02,869 --> 00:13:04,370
You tell him.

215
00:13:04,349 --> 00:13:06,559
Me? I told him last time,
you silly twit.

216
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:08,679
And I don't believe
in doing it twice.

217
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:10,382
Oy, here's an idea.

218
00:13:10,351 --> 00:13:12,186
Shorty, you tell him.

219
00:13:12,152 --> 00:13:13,778
Tell him what?

220
00:13:13,753 --> 00:13:16,714
That we... you know,
botched the job.

221
00:13:16,634 --> 00:13:19,846
He's not going to like that.

222
00:13:27,678 --> 00:13:29,763
Hello there.

223
00:13:34,081 --> 00:13:36,750
It don't look good...

224
00:13:36,681 --> 00:13:38,850
when only one shows up.

225
00:13:38,802 --> 00:13:42,389
Does it, small fry?

226
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:52,958
Blimey. I can't hear nothing
but step, clop, step, clop.

227
00:13:55,248 --> 00:13:57,125
Have a gander
at monstro's better side.

228
00:14:05,732 --> 00:14:08,568
He has something
to tell you, boss.

229
00:14:08,494 --> 00:14:10,829
It better be good news.

230
00:14:12,094 --> 00:14:14,639
Well, we did exactly
what you said to do...

231
00:14:14,575 --> 00:14:17,119
and dropped a safe
on the princess.

232
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:20,852
You what? I didn't say,
"Drop a safe," you dolt.

233
00:14:20,738 --> 00:14:23,074
I said, "Keep her safe."

234
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:24,645
Well, that's good...

235
00:14:24,619 --> 00:14:26,037
because we missed her.

236
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,020
Now listen, you mutts.

237
00:14:28,981 --> 00:14:30,149
I got a plan.

238
00:14:30,142 --> 00:14:32,686
And it ain't
to kill the princess.

239
00:14:32,623 --> 00:14:34,082
It's to kidnap her.

240
00:14:35,543 --> 00:14:37,629
The opera...
it's tomorrow night.

241
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:43,502
The princess has
got to be gone by then...

242
00:14:43,427 --> 00:14:46,513
or I can't become king.

243
00:14:49,869 --> 00:14:51,912
I... don't get it.

244
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,648
Lieutenant Clarabelle!

245
00:14:54,631 --> 00:14:56,550
Oui, oui, mon capitaine.

246
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,763
You bellowed?

247
00:14:57,752 --> 00:15:00,380
Throw these clowns
into the pit!

248
00:15:00,313 --> 00:15:02,273
Oui, oui! Le pit!

249
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,401
- No!
- Not that!

250
00:15:03,394 --> 00:15:04,562
Anything but le pit!

251
00:15:04,555 --> 00:15:07,224
Bon voyage... losers.

252
00:15:14,318 --> 00:15:16,737
Not so bad.

253
00:15:20,441 --> 00:15:24,069
Bonjour. Pete's secret lair.
Clarabelle speaking.

254
00:15:25,282 --> 00:15:26,700
The princess?!

255
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:32,683
All for one

256
00:15:32,645 --> 00:15:34,605
All men of honour,
hear the call

257
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:36,943
Musketeers sing
all for one and one for all

258
00:15:36,887 --> 00:15:39,055
Your Highness.

259
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:43,804
So glad you could grace us
with your royal omnipresences.

260
00:15:43,649 --> 00:15:45,568
I want bodyguards!

261
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,365
Musketeer bodyguards.

262
00:15:48,331 --> 00:15:50,208
Villains, bad guys
run in fear

263
00:15:50,172 --> 00:15:52,299
When they see
the musketeers

264
00:15:52,253 --> 00:15:54,129
Savin' Minnie is our duty

265
00:15:54,093 --> 00:15:55,845
Mess with her,
we'll kick your...

266
00:15:56,814 --> 00:15:58,316
Ouch.

267
00:15:58,294 --> 00:15:59,754
Bodyguards.

268
00:15:59,735 --> 00:16:01,195
Absolutely.

269
00:16:01,175 --> 00:16:03,803
Let me check my schedule here.

270
00:16:05,177 --> 00:16:08,847
How about next Thursday?

271
00:16:08,739 --> 00:16:10,491
How about ten minutes?

272
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,420
At the palace!

273
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,674
Get me bodyguards,
Captain Pete!

274
00:16:18,502 --> 00:16:21,004
Pancakes, cornflakes,
scrambled eggs

275
00:16:20,943 --> 00:16:23,654
Buttered toast
and apple jam

276
00:16:23,584 --> 00:16:25,502
Tonight it's meat,
I hope it's spam

277
00:16:25,465 --> 00:16:27,342
Goofy! Slow down!

278
00:16:34,268 --> 00:16:38,230
Princess, you're in luck.

279
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:40,237
Have I got the men for you.

280
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,400
Well, I hope so.

281
00:16:41,391 --> 00:16:43,268
Thanks to your
incompetence...

282
00:16:43,231 --> 00:16:46,526
this whole thing has been
a pain in the neck!

283
00:16:46,433 --> 00:16:49,311
I'll show you
a pain in the neck.

284
00:17:09,441 --> 00:17:11,402
Oh, boy.

285
00:17:13,803 --> 00:17:15,472
Hey, Donald.

286
00:17:15,443 --> 00:17:18,154
Don't worry about
what Captain Pete said.

287
00:17:18,085 --> 00:17:20,045
Cheer up. I'm sure
there's some way...

288
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:21,799
we can become musketeers.

289
00:17:21,766 --> 00:17:23,226
We can?

290
00:17:24,367 --> 00:17:28,622
Hey, Goof, you know we can prove
Pete's wrong about us...

291
00:17:28,489 --> 00:17:30,867
if we just work hard
and stick together.

292
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:34,569
You really think so?

293
00:17:34,531 --> 00:17:36,867
Hey, have I ever
let you down?

294
00:17:36,812 --> 00:17:38,772
Have I? Have I? Have I?

295
00:17:38,732 --> 00:17:40,151
No.

296
00:17:40,133 --> 00:17:41,301
Just imagine, guys.

297
00:17:41,294 --> 00:17:43,588
Maybe not today,
maybe not tomorrow...

298
00:17:43,534 --> 00:17:46,996
but someday Captain Pete's
gonna march in here and say...

299
00:17:46,896 --> 00:17:48,523
Congratulations, boys!

300
00:17:49,617 --> 00:17:51,244
You passed the test.

301
00:17:51,217 --> 00:17:53,011
I've been watching
you three...

302
00:17:52,979 --> 00:17:54,689
and I'll tell you what.

303
00:17:54,658 --> 00:17:59,997
You guys have got what it takes
to be musketeers!

304
00:17:59,821 --> 00:18:01,989
Really? You mean it?

305
00:18:01,941 --> 00:18:03,735
Cross my heart.

306
00:18:03,702 --> 00:18:05,621
Oh, boy! Hey, fellas!

307
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:07,668
We're gonna be musketeers!

308
00:18:07,624 --> 00:18:08,958
Musketeers!

309
00:18:08,944 --> 00:18:10,529
Musketeers!

310
00:18:16,146 --> 00:18:18,566
I knew we had what it takes.

311
00:18:18,507 --> 00:18:20,050
'Cause we're clever.

312
00:18:20,028 --> 00:18:22,072
And brave.

313
00:18:22,029 --> 00:18:25,866
And together we are gonna be
great big heroes.

314
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:26,960
What do you say, men?

315
00:18:26,951 --> 00:18:28,244
All for one...

316
00:18:28,231 --> 00:18:29,816
And two for tea!

317
00:18:34,874 --> 00:18:38,044
Well, we'll work on it.

318
00:18:41,556 --> 00:18:43,767
Hup, deux, trois, quatre.

319
00:18:43,717 --> 00:18:46,136
Hup, deux, trois, quatre.

320
00:18:46,078 --> 00:18:47,830
Hup, deux, trois, quatre.

321
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:50,301
Hup, deux, trois, quatre.

322
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,659
Company... halt!

323
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:57,313
Stay here whilst I go schmooze
Princess what's-her-name.

324
00:18:59,483 --> 00:19:01,277
Wow. This is it, guys.

325
00:19:01,243 --> 00:19:04,872
This is what we've been
waiting for all our lives.

326
00:19:04,765 --> 00:19:07,392
Now, when
these doors open...

327
00:19:07,326 --> 00:19:09,537
we've got to make
a great first impression.

328
00:19:15,129 --> 00:19:16,547
OK.

329
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,323
Remember, fellas,
we're on duty...

330
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:21,460
and this place could be
crawling with bad guys.

331
00:19:21,372 --> 00:19:23,040
Bad guys?!

332
00:19:23,013 --> 00:19:24,597
So stay alert!

333
00:19:24,573 --> 00:19:26,408
You heard him. Stay alert!

334
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:28,333
Aye, aye, sir.

335
00:19:30,575 --> 00:19:32,411
Bad guy! No!

336
00:19:33,736 --> 00:19:35,029
Goofy!

337
00:19:39,938 --> 00:19:43,441
Gosh. He pulled an ax on me.

338
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:46,593
Your Royal Highness,
I have never, ever had...

339
00:19:46,501 --> 00:19:49,296
a more highly skilled group
of gentlemen...

340
00:19:49,222 --> 00:19:52,642
than the individuals which
I present to you today.

341
00:19:52,543 --> 00:19:54,837
Seems like this is
gonna take a while.

342
00:19:54,784 --> 00:19:57,119
I'll go get you
a little snack.

343
00:19:57,065 --> 00:20:01,361
It took my highly trained eye
to see their true potential.

344
00:20:01,227 --> 00:20:05,523
Yes. Well, France thanks you
and your eye very much.

345
00:20:05,388 --> 00:20:08,475
Well, then it is
without further ado...

346
00:20:08,389 --> 00:20:11,476
that I present,
for your complete safety...

347
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,726
and protection...

348
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:17,800
your musketeers!

349
00:20:41,242 --> 00:20:43,285
Just imagine.

350
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,870
He'll stride into the room.

351
00:20:45,803 --> 00:20:48,765
Light will glow from him.

352
00:20:48,684 --> 00:20:51,270
I'll hear music.

353
00:20:51,205 --> 00:20:54,083
He'll bring me flowers.

354
00:20:59,689 --> 00:21:03,651
And he'll sweep me
off my feet.

355
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:07,492
And I'll know he's the one
when he makes me laugh.

356
00:21:07,371 --> 00:21:10,833
Your Majesty,
it's time to cut the cheese.

357
00:21:10,732 --> 00:21:13,110
What?

358
00:21:13,054 --> 00:21:16,682
Here we are. Roquefort, anyone?

359
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:19,571
- Knife!
- Bad guy!

360
00:21:19,536 --> 00:21:21,830
Grab her!

361
00:21:21,777 --> 00:21:23,737
Oh, no.

362
00:21:23,698 --> 00:21:25,491
Help!

363
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:29,337
Unhand her!
Release her! Stop it!

364
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,402
Drop her!

365
00:21:33,661 --> 00:21:36,456
She is my lady-in-waiting!

366
00:21:42,105 --> 00:21:44,273
You'll have to forgive them,
Your Highness.

367
00:21:44,225 --> 00:21:46,519
They're like
a well-oiled machine...

368
00:21:46,467 --> 00:21:49,887
that's wound
just a little too tight.

369
00:21:51,508 --> 00:21:53,802
We're sorry, Your Grace.

370
00:21:53,749 --> 00:21:55,751
We thought she was a villain.

371
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,876
I don't think so.

372
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:01,792
I see. Well, then...

373
00:22:01,712 --> 00:22:04,882
I feel safer already.

374
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:21,498
Oh, no.

375
00:22:21,479 --> 00:22:25,650
When the bad guy is that happy,
it always, always means...

376
00:22:27,361 --> 00:22:29,864
Bad-guy song!

377
00:22:32,003 --> 00:22:34,464
I was born
to cheat and lie

378
00:22:34,404 --> 00:22:36,656
I'm a mean, rotten guy

379
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,565
When you ask me
why I'm nasty

380
00:22:38,526 --> 00:22:40,444
Here's my reason why

381
00:22:40,407 --> 00:22:43,619
At that stork delivery,
Mommy screamed

382
00:22:43,527 --> 00:22:45,404
"Woe is me, such a dork"

383
00:22:45,369 --> 00:22:47,538
"Hey, Mr Stork,
behold my misery"

384
00:22:47,489 --> 00:22:49,783
"Pete is ghastly,
Pete's a blob"

385
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:52,024
"Pete's a nasty,
naughty slob"

386
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:55,474
Can it, sister, I'm the mister
who will get the job

387
00:22:55,372 --> 00:22:58,583
So I'm nasty, I'm no good,
I'll be king, knock on wood

388
00:22:58,493 --> 00:23:01,788
I'll impress ya, though I'm
just a common lowly hood, ha!

389
00:23:01,695 --> 00:23:03,572
If you can't be loved,
be feared

390
00:23:03,535 --> 00:23:05,245
Don't get shoved,
sheep get sheared

391
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,884
Be the king,
pull the strings

392
00:23:06,857 --> 00:23:09,109
Or else
you might get smeared

393
00:23:09,057 --> 00:23:11,476
I'm so happy I could dance,
seize my chance, I'll advance

394
00:23:11,419 --> 00:23:13,421
Come and cheer me,
love and fear me

395
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:16,007
Petey's king of France,
ha ha

396
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,942
Evening, trusted lieutenant.

397
00:23:17,901 --> 00:23:19,902
Watch out for the bricks.

398
00:23:19,861 --> 00:23:22,030
What?

399
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:24,235
Come and cheer me,
love and fear me

400
00:23:24,183 --> 00:23:29,354
Petey's king of France

401
00:23:29,185 --> 00:23:31,104
Why'd the music stop?

402
00:23:34,227 --> 00:23:37,355
Hello, boys.

403
00:23:41,229 --> 00:23:43,440
Think you might have
some spare time...

404
00:23:43,391 --> 00:23:45,810
to go and snatch
the princess?

405
00:23:45,751 --> 00:23:47,086
Yeah, I think.

406
00:23:47,072 --> 00:23:48,698
Well, quit thinking
and do it!

407
00:23:48,672 --> 00:23:49,923
The opera's tomorrow night!

408
00:23:53,714 --> 00:23:56,550
The job's got
to be done by then!

409
00:23:56,475 --> 00:23:57,685
Remember?

410
00:23:57,676 --> 00:23:59,136
How can we help?

411
00:23:59,117 --> 00:24:02,495
I want you to grab her,
find a remote tower somewhere...

412
00:24:02,398 --> 00:24:04,191
and lock her away forever...

413
00:24:04,158 --> 00:24:07,036
so as no one can
ever find her again!

414
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,253
You got me, dingbats?

415
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,786
Sure thing, boss.

416
00:24:25,526 --> 00:24:28,487
Isn't this
musketeering stuff great?

417
00:24:28,407 --> 00:24:30,242
You bet!

418
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:32,001
Isn't it romantic,
Daisy...

419
00:24:31,969 --> 00:24:34,680
being protected
by three dashing musketeers?

420
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:37,863
And the little one
is so handsome.

421
00:24:37,771 --> 00:24:39,939
Yeah... he's kind of
cute and all...

422
00:24:39,892 --> 00:24:41,852
but you're forgetting
something.

423
00:24:41,812 --> 00:24:47,359
They're musketeers, commoners,
non-college-bound.

424
00:24:47,174 --> 00:24:49,551
You know what that means.

425
00:24:49,495 --> 00:24:52,081
Our love is... forbidden?

426
00:24:53,137 --> 00:24:54,471
Bingo.

427
00:24:54,457 --> 00:24:56,876
A forbidden love.

428
00:24:56,818 --> 00:24:59,487
How romantic.

429
00:25:06,061 --> 00:25:07,688
Bad guys!

430
00:25:07,663 --> 00:25:08,789
Bad guys!

431
00:25:08,782 --> 00:25:10,200
Bad guys?

432
00:25:11,984 --> 00:25:13,277
Yikes!

433
00:25:17,186 --> 00:25:19,271
OK, you. En garde.

434
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:20,686
En garde?

435
00:25:20,667 --> 00:25:24,170
French words make me mad!

436
00:25:29,951 --> 00:25:32,829
Get out there and fight,
you coward!

437
00:25:35,753 --> 00:25:39,298
You fellas seen
any bad guys around here?

438
00:25:39,194 --> 00:25:42,448
Ooh. How about this bad guy?

439
00:25:48,237 --> 00:25:49,989
Goofy!

440
00:25:49,958 --> 00:25:52,794
Hit the road, tiny.

441
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:54,470
Mickey!

442
00:26:09,885 --> 00:26:10,928
Princess!

443
00:26:29,293 --> 00:26:32,046
Now how are we going
to protect the princess?

444
00:26:31,974 --> 00:26:34,602
Protect the princess?
Are you kidding?

445
00:26:34,535 --> 00:26:38,747
It's hopeless. We failed.

446
00:26:38,617 --> 00:26:39,660
Hopeless?

447
00:26:39,657 --> 00:26:41,326
Failed?

448
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,979
There, there, pal.

449
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:51,401
Here. Blow.

450
00:26:55,623 --> 00:26:58,375
Well, I don't think
we're hopeless.

451
00:26:58,304 --> 00:27:00,473
Listen, Captain Pete
has faith in us.

452
00:27:00,425 --> 00:27:02,468
He does?

453
00:27:02,425 --> 00:27:04,636
I mean, he does!

454
00:27:04,586 --> 00:27:07,047
Pete made us musketeers,
remember?

455
00:27:06,987 --> 00:27:10,073
Yeah! We're musketeers!

456
00:27:09,989 --> 00:27:13,826
That's right, just like
we dreamed when we were kids.

457
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:16,671
So, what do you say?
Are we a team?

458
00:27:16,591 --> 00:27:19,218
Count me in, Mickey!

459
00:27:19,152 --> 00:27:21,112
Me, too! Me, too!

460
00:27:21,073 --> 00:27:23,701
We're off
to save the princess!

461
00:27:23,633 --> 00:27:25,468
No obstacle too big!

462
00:27:25,434 --> 00:27:26,435
Yeah!

463
00:27:26,435 --> 00:27:27,853
No danger too great!

464
00:27:27,835 --> 00:27:29,545
You said it!

465
00:27:29,515 --> 00:27:34,145
Together, we'll save
the princess or die trying!

466
00:27:33,998 --> 00:27:35,541
Die?

467
00:27:37,399 --> 00:27:38,734
Die?

468
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:44,382
Hey, Goof,
this door won't budge!

469
00:27:44,241 --> 00:27:46,243
Let me give it a go!

470
00:27:51,284 --> 00:27:53,786
Hey, Goof, wait.
I got it...

471
00:27:57,047 --> 00:27:58,673
What the heck was that?

472
00:28:22,536 --> 00:28:24,496
Door's open.

473
00:28:24,456 --> 00:28:27,126
Oy, what we do
about them musketeers?

474
00:28:27,058 --> 00:28:28,517
We's 87 floors up.

475
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:30,667
It'll be hours before
they's on us.

476
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,254
Hold it right... there.

477
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:38,593
You... fiends!

478
00:28:38,581 --> 00:28:41,084
Sling them birds in their cage.

479
00:28:44,824 --> 00:28:45,992
Your Highness!

480
00:28:45,984 --> 00:28:49,404
Let's have a bit of fun
with these blighters, eh?

481
00:28:49,306 --> 00:28:50,474
Let's get 'em!

482
00:28:56,148 --> 00:28:57,483
Stop.

483
00:28:57,469 --> 00:29:00,013
Let the girls go.

484
00:29:06,793 --> 00:29:09,796
You feel lucky, ducky?

485
00:29:17,837 --> 00:29:20,298
Hang about.
Is that Halley's comet?

486
00:29:20,237 --> 00:29:21,989
Halley's comet! Where?

487
00:29:28,121 --> 00:29:29,664
Let me go! Let me go!

488
00:29:29,641 --> 00:29:31,184
I'll slice you to ribbons!

489
00:29:31,162 --> 00:29:32,330
What the...

490
00:29:32,322 --> 00:29:33,615
My sword!

491
00:29:37,964 --> 00:29:40,091
Goofy, we got to do
something quick...

492
00:29:40,045 --> 00:29:41,463
or the princess is done for.

493
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:44,157
It's all over.

494
00:29:45,607 --> 00:29:48,944
Looks like you blokes
got in over your heads...

495
00:29:59,572 --> 00:30:00,990
What are you planning, Goof?

496
00:30:00,973 --> 00:30:04,060
I got an idea. You with me?

497
00:30:03,974 --> 00:30:05,809
You bet.

498
00:30:05,775 --> 00:30:07,902
Hot soup, coming through!

499
00:30:11,497 --> 00:30:14,500
That was a bit of a barney,
wasn't it?

500
00:30:50,712 --> 00:30:52,172
Did we do it?

501
00:30:52,153 --> 00:30:54,113
Yeah! We did it!

502
00:30:54,073 --> 00:30:56,492
The three of us did it!

503
00:30:56,433 --> 00:30:58,144
All for one and...

504
00:30:58,114 --> 00:31:00,033
Wait. Where's Donald?

505
00:30:59,995 --> 00:31:03,082
We did it? Well, alright!

506
00:31:05,598 --> 00:31:09,560
Hurray! We did it!

507
00:31:16,122 --> 00:31:17,582
Let me just...

508
00:31:17,562 --> 00:31:19,856
Kind of tight.

509
00:31:23,804 --> 00:31:25,514
Oops.

510
00:31:27,526 --> 00:31:30,737
Mickey made her laugh...

511
00:31:30,647 --> 00:31:32,941
so she knew
he was the one.

512
00:31:32,887 --> 00:31:36,391
But will their love bloom
on the way back to Paris?

513
00:31:36,289 --> 00:31:39,750
Perhaps...
if I sing them a song.

514
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:42,278
Afloat on the breeze

515
00:31:42,211 --> 00:31:44,297
On wings of love

516
00:31:44,252 --> 00:31:46,212
Like birds
and like bees

517
00:31:46,173 --> 00:31:48,466
Sweet wings of love

518
00:31:48,413 --> 00:31:50,373
The first day we met

519
00:31:50,334 --> 00:31:52,378
On wings of love

520
00:31:52,335 --> 00:31:54,462
We watched the sun set

521
00:31:54,415 --> 00:31:56,125
Sweet wings of love

522
00:31:56,096 --> 00:31:58,056
And if by some chance

523
00:31:58,017 --> 00:31:59,894
Some twist of fate

524
00:31:59,858 --> 00:32:01,735
We're chasing romance

525
00:32:01,698 --> 00:32:03,992
It's not too late

526
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:08,278
It's heaven's design,
you'll be mine

527
00:32:08,141 --> 00:32:10,811
Hands entwined
on wings of love

528
00:32:10,742 --> 00:32:12,285
Of love

529
00:32:12,262 --> 00:32:14,306
A real-life fairy tale

530
00:32:14,264 --> 00:32:16,099
Fairy tale

531
00:32:16,064 --> 00:32:18,400
Down the streams
of life we sail

532
00:32:18,345 --> 00:32:20,138
Life we sail

533
00:32:20,106 --> 00:32:22,233
And our world
in twilight gleams

534
00:32:22,187 --> 00:32:23,855
Twilight gleams

535
00:32:23,827 --> 00:32:25,870
Like the light
in your eyes

536
00:32:25,828 --> 00:32:27,872
Inside my dreams

537
00:32:27,829 --> 00:32:31,207
Your whisper lightly
tickling my ear

538
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:33,737
It's Paris,
ah, in the spring

539
00:32:33,671 --> 00:32:35,589
Spring, spring,
spring, spring

540
00:32:35,551 --> 00:32:39,055
I feel so giddy,
one thing is clear

541
00:32:38,952 --> 00:32:43,207
You stir my heart to sing

542
00:32:43,074 --> 00:32:45,327
Don't take
your hand from mine

543
00:32:45,275 --> 00:32:47,486
Hand from mine

544
00:32:47,435 --> 00:32:50,188
Just hold tight
until you find

545
00:32:50,117 --> 00:32:53,871
You're the light
I'm dreaming of

546
00:32:53,758 --> 00:32:55,885
Dreaming of

547
00:32:55,839 --> 00:32:58,675
And I'm waiting for you
on wings of love

548
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,644
Bonne nuit.

549
00:33:03,602 --> 00:33:07,022
Waiting for you
on wings...

550
00:33:06,923 --> 00:33:08,717
Lovely little wings

551
00:33:08,683 --> 00:33:13,313
Of love

552
00:33:13,166 --> 00:33:14,626
On wings of love

553
00:33:14,606 --> 00:33:19,569
Ah, young love.

554
00:33:19,408 --> 00:33:21,535
I got a problem!

555
00:33:21,489 --> 00:33:24,992
Those three chowderheads have
proven tougher than I thought.

556
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:27,309
Yeah? So?

557
00:33:27,251 --> 00:33:28,752
So quit hanging around.

558
00:33:28,731 --> 00:33:30,775
We've got a change
of plans, see.

559
00:33:30,733 --> 00:33:32,860
Now we're gonna have to
pull the switcheroo...

560
00:33:32,813 --> 00:33:35,983
tomorrow night...
at the opera.

561
00:33:38,855 --> 00:33:42,067
That little ditty
is starting to grow on me.

562
00:33:41,976 --> 00:33:45,939
Now listen.
To get to the princess...

563
00:33:45,817 --> 00:33:52,366
we're gonna have to pick
those guys off one by one.

564
00:33:58,103 --> 00:34:00,772
Mickey and Minnie Mouse.

565
00:34:00,704 --> 00:34:02,372
Look, Daisy.

566
00:34:02,344 --> 00:34:04,846
Mickey and I have
the same last name.

567
00:34:05,985 --> 00:34:07,904
Well, it must be destiny.

568
00:34:07,867 --> 00:34:10,619
Good thing destiny
doesn't control my love life.

569
00:34:10,547 --> 00:34:12,007
What do you mean?

570
00:34:11,987 --> 00:34:14,031
Well, look at me.
If it did...

571
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:15,866
I'd get stuck
with Mister...

572
00:34:21,391 --> 00:34:23,727
Two, three...

573
00:34:23,672 --> 00:34:25,632
four.

574
00:34:25,593 --> 00:34:28,096
Two, three...

575
00:34:28,033 --> 00:34:29,785
four.

576
00:34:32,555 --> 00:34:34,349
Bad guys.

577
00:34:34,317 --> 00:34:37,278
Attention, Musketeer Goofy.

578
00:34:37,198 --> 00:34:39,158
Mickey, is that you?

579
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:41,495
Yes, Musketeer Goofy.

580
00:34:41,439 --> 00:34:43,607
I am in need
of your assistance.

581
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,520
You sure are talking funny.

582
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:49,985
I was eating escargot
and peanut butter.

583
00:34:49,842 --> 00:34:52,053
Hey, save some for me!

584
00:34:55,604 --> 00:34:57,064
Over here.

585
00:35:00,646 --> 00:35:02,857
Follow me, Goofy.

586
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:12,101
Mickey!

587
00:35:12,091 --> 00:35:13,467
You're almost there.

588
00:35:13,451 --> 00:35:15,161
Mickey!

589
00:35:16,452 --> 00:35:19,205
Doggone! Where'd he go?

590
00:35:19,134 --> 00:35:22,303
Mickey! Mickey!

591
00:35:25,376 --> 00:35:28,546
Quack, two, three, four.

592
00:35:28,456 --> 00:35:31,501
Quack, two, three...

593
00:35:31,418 --> 00:35:32,794
Quack!

594
00:35:35,179 --> 00:35:38,141
Hello, handsome.

595
00:35:43,702 --> 00:35:44,953
What the...

596
00:35:44,943 --> 00:35:46,361
- Booga booga!
- Booga booga!

597
00:35:46,343 --> 00:35:48,512
Booga booga booga
booga booga!

598
00:35:48,464 --> 00:35:51,009
Beat it, you guys.

599
00:35:50,945 --> 00:35:53,573
I told you twits
these Pete masks wouldn't work.

600
00:35:53,506 --> 00:35:56,050
Let's go to plan "B."

601
00:35:57,428 --> 00:36:00,681
Hey, you're the bad guys!

602
00:36:00,589 --> 00:36:02,382
Don't move!

603
00:36:39,644 --> 00:36:42,689
What's going on?

604
00:36:50,488 --> 00:36:52,031
Captain Pete!

605
00:36:52,008 --> 00:36:53,801
I'm in such a good mood.

606
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:01,430
Come back here,
you little bird beak!

607
00:37:10,656 --> 00:37:12,115
Pluto.

608
00:37:12,096 --> 00:37:14,390
Pluto, slow down, boy.
What is it? Whoa!

609
00:37:16,097 --> 00:37:17,932
Hey, where's Goofy?

610
00:37:19,139 --> 00:37:21,433
Donald!

611
00:37:24,101 --> 00:37:27,020
Something strange
is going on here.

612
00:37:30,663 --> 00:37:32,081
Who's there?

613
00:37:32,063 --> 00:37:36,109
You better come out of there,
or I'm coming in after you!

614
00:37:41,307 --> 00:37:42,642
Donald?

615
00:37:42,627 --> 00:37:45,046
What's the big idea?
Come down from there!

616
00:37:44,988 --> 00:37:46,656
Why aren't you
at your post?

617
00:37:46,629 --> 00:37:49,382
We got to get Goofy
and get out of here!

618
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:52,021
Goofy? Where is he?
He's not at his post either.

619
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:54,369
Oh, no!
He's already got Goofy!

620
00:37:54,312 --> 00:37:56,481
Wait! Who's got Goofy?

621
00:37:56,433 --> 00:37:59,352
Donald... stop!

622
00:37:59,274 --> 00:38:01,651
Donald, are you nuts?
What's going on?

623
00:38:01,594 --> 00:38:03,429
Pete is gonna kidnap
Princess Minnie...

624
00:38:03,395 --> 00:38:06,940
so he can become king
because he's really a bad guy...

625
00:38:06,837 --> 00:38:10,716
and he has a secret lair,
and it's really dark and scary!

626
00:38:10,598 --> 00:38:12,183
So the point is...

627
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:14,953
he's gonna kill us
if we get in his way!

628
00:38:14,879 --> 00:38:18,633
So we should run now
as far away as we can!

629
00:38:21,162 --> 00:38:24,207
Donald, I can't understand
a word you say.

630
00:38:24,123 --> 00:38:25,124
No!

631
00:38:25,123 --> 00:38:27,334
Put me down! Whoa!

632
00:38:27,285 --> 00:38:28,828
We can't leave
our posts like this!

633
00:38:28,804 --> 00:38:30,306
What would
Captain Pete say?

634
00:38:30,286 --> 00:38:32,705
Captain Pete is the bad guy!

635
00:38:32,646 --> 00:38:35,149
Captain Pete is the bad guy?

636
00:38:36,968 --> 00:38:38,052
What?

637
00:38:39,368 --> 00:38:41,996
Pete's trying
to kidnap the princess?

638
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:44,224
Exactly!

639
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:47,173
But he made us musketeers.

640
00:38:47,092 --> 00:38:49,261
It was all a lie.

641
00:38:49,213 --> 00:38:52,382
A lie? Well, lie or no lie...

642
00:38:52,294 --> 00:38:54,254
musketeers don't run
from danger...

643
00:38:54,214 --> 00:38:57,926
and as long as we
wear these uniforms...

644
00:38:57,816 --> 00:38:59,192
neither do we.

645
00:38:59,176 --> 00:39:00,719
You said it!

646
00:39:02,058 --> 00:39:05,686
It's every duck for himself.

647
00:39:05,579 --> 00:39:06,872
Donald, wait!

648
00:39:06,859 --> 00:39:09,236
Together,
we can stop Captain Pete.

649
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,432
Remember how we rescued
the princess?

650
00:39:13,901 --> 00:39:17,488
I was hiding.

651
00:39:17,383 --> 00:39:19,218
Hiding? Well...

652
00:39:19,184 --> 00:39:21,311
tonight, you came back
to warn us...

653
00:39:21,265 --> 00:39:23,225
and that took courage, Donald.

654
00:39:25,626 --> 00:39:27,544
Come on. I'll be
right beside you...

655
00:39:27,507 --> 00:39:29,175
because we're friends.

656
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:38,237
I just can't. I'm sorry.

657
00:39:39,271 --> 00:39:41,231
Donald!

658
00:39:45,634 --> 00:39:47,677
Donald.

659
00:39:53,717 --> 00:39:55,677
Thanks, boy.

660
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,555
What is it?
What is it, boy?

661
00:40:08,923 --> 00:40:11,384
Well, well, well.

662
00:40:11,323 --> 00:40:13,909
If it ain't
the one musketeer.

663
00:40:13,844 --> 00:40:17,723
Captain Pete, by the power
vested in me as a musketeer...

664
00:40:17,605 --> 00:40:19,357
I arrest you, mister!

665
00:40:19,327 --> 00:40:22,038
That's a good one!

666
00:40:21,968 --> 00:40:23,886
Well, how about this?

667
00:40:23,848 --> 00:40:27,977
By the power invested
in my fist, I clobber you!

668
00:40:59,902 --> 00:41:01,862
Hey there! Hi there!
Ho there!

669
00:41:01,823 --> 00:41:03,992
You're as welcome
as can be

670
00:41:20,549 --> 00:41:21,759
Oopsie.

671
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:26,822
I am such a butterfingers.

672
00:41:26,712 --> 00:41:28,589
Hey! Put me down!

673
00:41:28,553 --> 00:41:30,888
Don't make me
have to whoop you!

674
00:41:30,833 --> 00:41:33,544
OK, fine.
Just hold still, you runt.

675
00:41:37,636 --> 00:41:39,722
It looks like this
is the end of the line.

676
00:41:41,318 --> 00:41:44,654
Think so? My pals
will be right behind us.

677
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:46,311
Oh, sure.

678
00:41:46,279 --> 00:41:48,240
The duck dumped you.

679
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,827
Remember?

680
00:41:49,801 --> 00:41:52,762
Well... Goofy then!

681
00:41:52,682 --> 00:41:56,769
The goof? He's getting
fitted for a halo.

682
00:41:56,643 --> 00:41:59,896
No, no, no.

683
00:41:59,805 --> 00:42:01,848
Yes, yes, yes!

684
00:42:01,805 --> 00:42:05,267
Face it, Mickey...
it's all for one...

685
00:42:05,167 --> 00:42:08,587
and you are on your own!

686
00:42:10,168 --> 00:42:13,046
Enjoy your brief stay here
at the Mont St. Michel.

687
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:16,598
You know, they say the tide
comes in faster than horses!

688
00:42:17,651 --> 00:42:20,571
So long, runt!

689
00:42:20,492 --> 00:42:22,744
I got me tickets
to the opera...

690
00:42:22,693 --> 00:42:24,152
a little something
called...

691
00:42:24,133 --> 00:42:26,844
"I Just Can't Wait
to be King."

692
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:10,601
This is it, handsome.

693
00:43:10,551 --> 00:43:14,847
Get ready for the big sleep,
the river of no return...

694
00:43:14,713 --> 00:43:18,550
the long day's journey
into night.

695
00:43:23,436 --> 00:43:27,899
Gosh. Your sweet voice
is music to my ears.

696
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:34,361
Your chains of love
now hold me tight

697
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:37,868
Your bovine beauty
makes my heart take flight

698
00:43:37,762 --> 00:43:41,808
You will not change
my mind one smidge

699
00:43:41,683 --> 00:43:45,562
I'm going to drop you
screaming off this bridge

700
00:43:48,405 --> 00:43:53,077
Clarabelle, you drive me nuts!

701
00:43:52,927 --> 00:43:55,555
His love's so sweet,
his love's so blind

702
00:43:55,489 --> 00:43:57,449
Poor Goof...

703
00:43:57,409 --> 00:43:59,285
You have to kill him

704
00:43:59,249 --> 00:44:02,586
Poor grunge

705
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:06,536
Farewell

706
00:44:06,412 --> 00:44:08,873
Take the plunge

707
00:44:12,455 --> 00:44:16,208
My milkmaid miss,
you charm my soul

708
00:44:16,096 --> 00:44:19,850
You leave me
utterly beyond control

709
00:44:19,738 --> 00:44:23,450
Call me a goof,
but one thing's clear

710
00:44:23,338 --> 00:44:27,009
Your melodious moo
is music to my ears

711
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:29,153
He's no Don Juan

712
00:44:29,101 --> 00:44:31,145
He's not real smart

713
00:44:31,102 --> 00:44:34,772
And yet he's touched
my little cowhide heart

714
00:44:34,663 --> 00:44:38,291
He loves my moo,
my cow-like gaze

715
00:44:38,184 --> 00:44:42,647
His numskull charm

716
00:44:42,505 --> 00:44:47,594
Has set my heart

717
00:44:48,909 --> 00:44:50,702
Ablaze

718
00:45:14,478 --> 00:45:15,980
Hurry, my love.

719
00:45:15,958 --> 00:45:17,919
You don't have much time.

720
00:45:17,879 --> 00:45:20,465
Your friend Mickey
is in dire peril.

721
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,943
No, he's not.

722
00:45:21,921 --> 00:45:23,798
He's in the musketeers.

723
00:45:23,761 --> 00:45:26,139
I mean he's in danger.

724
00:45:29,084 --> 00:45:35,256
I'll be a musketeer
when cows fall from the sky.

725
00:45:35,046 --> 00:45:36,506
What?

726
00:46:05,017 --> 00:46:07,019
We're coming, Mickey!

727
00:46:06,978 --> 00:46:09,397
Put me down! Put me down!

728
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:13,608
Goofy!

729
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:15,999
Pete's gonna kill us!

730
00:46:15,942 --> 00:46:18,027
Pete or no Pete,
Mickey's our pal...

731
00:46:17,982 --> 00:46:19,567
and we got to save him.

732
00:46:19,542 --> 00:46:21,461
All for one and one for all.

733
00:46:21,424 --> 00:46:23,843
Remember? I know
it's the most hideous...

734
00:46:23,784 --> 00:46:25,995
house of torture
in all of France...

735
00:46:25,945 --> 00:46:27,780
but we're going in there!

736
00:46:33,348 --> 00:46:35,016
Gosh, Pluto.

737
00:46:34,989 --> 00:46:37,366
Could this be the end
of the three musketeers?

738
00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:41,606
This is the end

739
00:46:41,470 --> 00:46:45,516
This is the end

740
00:46:45,393 --> 00:46:48,229
That Donald Duck has left
poor Mickey Mouse to drown

741
00:46:48,154 --> 00:46:51,323
And Goofy trusted him,
but Donald let him down

742
00:46:51,234 --> 00:46:53,528
We all berate him
because we hate him

743
00:46:53,476 --> 00:46:55,353
He is a traitor,
vacillator

744
00:46:55,316 --> 00:46:56,985
He's a lousy second-rater

745
00:46:56,956 --> 00:46:59,083
Mangy mallard,
he's a coward

746
00:46:59,037 --> 00:47:01,331
Donald's destiny has soured,
it's the end

747
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:06,022
I'll show you, dirty tortoise!

748
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:08,170
That way, tiger.

749
00:47:13,522 --> 00:47:15,566
Wait for me!

750
00:47:16,964 --> 00:47:19,592
Thanks for the song.

751
00:47:21,846 --> 00:47:22,888
Donald!

752
00:47:26,407 --> 00:47:29,619
Come on!
We've got to save Mickey!

753
00:47:46,695 --> 00:47:49,240
We're coming, Mickey!

754
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:18,686
Mickey.

755
00:48:18,667 --> 00:48:19,835
Mickey?

756
00:48:19,828 --> 00:48:21,579
Mickey, come back to us, pal.

757
00:48:22,829 --> 00:48:24,288
I think he's
coming out of it.

758
00:48:27,790 --> 00:48:30,335
Donald? Goofy?

759
00:48:30,271 --> 00:48:32,148
Pete told me
you were a goner.

760
00:48:32,113 --> 00:48:34,323
Shucks. I ain't...

761
00:48:34,273 --> 00:48:36,317
...Going nowhere
without you, Mick.

762
00:48:36,275 --> 00:48:37,901
Hey!

763
00:48:37,875 --> 00:48:40,002
Aw, pal.

764
00:48:39,956 --> 00:48:42,416
You came back.

765
00:48:42,356 --> 00:48:45,651
Aw... of course I did.

766
00:48:45,558 --> 00:48:47,268
We wouldn't
let you down, Mick.

767
00:48:47,239 --> 00:48:48,406
We're your friends.

768
00:48:48,399 --> 00:48:49,609
Yeah.

769
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:50,976
Come on.

770
00:48:52,441 --> 00:48:54,651
We've got to save
the princess.

771
00:48:54,601 --> 00:48:56,311
Don't you remember?

772
00:48:56,282 --> 00:48:58,242
All for one...

773
00:48:58,203 --> 00:49:00,330
Yeah.

774
00:49:00,283 --> 00:49:04,287
Aw, fellas, we're not even
real musketeers.

775
00:49:04,165 --> 00:49:07,919
Not real musketeers?
Who says so?

776
00:49:07,806 --> 00:49:09,391
Listen, Donald might be
a big chicken...

777
00:49:09,367 --> 00:49:10,910
Hey!

778
00:49:10,887 --> 00:49:13,389
And you're just
a little guy...

779
00:49:13,328 --> 00:49:16,581
and I ain't no genius,
but I know one thing.

780
00:49:16,489 --> 00:49:18,199
When the three of us
stick together...

781
00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:20,547
We can do anything.

782
00:49:20,491 --> 00:49:21,909
And not Pete...

783
00:49:21,892 --> 00:49:24,603
Or nobody else can stop us!

784
00:49:24,532 --> 00:49:28,036
Musketeers,
we've got a princess to rescue.

785
00:49:29,254 --> 00:49:31,214
Come on, Goof!

786
00:49:31,175 --> 00:49:32,551
Come on, Donald!

787
00:49:32,535 --> 00:49:34,954
I'm right behind you!

788
00:49:41,419 --> 00:49:44,589
Princess Minnie.

789
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:46,710
Your Grace.

790
00:49:50,462 --> 00:49:52,381
Captain Pete?

791
00:49:52,342 --> 00:49:55,888
Bonjourney, princess.

792
00:49:57,424 --> 00:50:00,135
Where are my bodyguards?

793
00:50:00,066 --> 00:50:04,571
I'll be your bodyguard tonight,
sweet cheeks.

794
00:50:04,427 --> 00:50:06,763
This is an outrage!

795
00:50:06,709 --> 00:50:13,257
No. It's my nefarious plan
to steal the throne.

796
00:50:13,031 --> 00:50:15,700
Does this crown
make my ears look big?

797
00:50:18,792 --> 00:50:21,253
You know what to do.

798
00:50:21,194 --> 00:50:22,987
Righty-o, boss.

799
00:50:28,836 --> 00:50:32,423
Look! There it is!

800
00:50:34,558 --> 00:50:37,144
OK, shortstop, do your stuff.

801
00:50:48,284 --> 00:50:50,578
Attention,
my loyal subjects.

802
00:50:50,525 --> 00:50:53,194
Due to the stress
of princessing...

803
00:50:53,126 --> 00:50:55,587
my duties have become
too overwhelming...

804
00:50:55,526 --> 00:50:58,363
for a delicate flower
such as myself.

805
00:51:00,488 --> 00:51:06,244
Therefore, I now present
your new ruler, King Pete!

806
00:51:09,652 --> 00:51:12,947
I did it, Mommy!

807
00:51:12,853 --> 00:51:15,439
I'm king of all France!

808
00:51:15,375 --> 00:51:18,169
I feel like eating a snail.

809
00:51:18,095 --> 00:51:20,389
Now, on with the show.

810
00:51:25,058 --> 00:51:28,770
Allo. C'est moi.

811
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:35,163
Come, friends
who plough the sea

812
00:51:35,102 --> 00:51:38,563
Truce to navigation,
take another station...

813
00:51:44,185 --> 00:51:46,563
That-a boy, Pluto.
Find the princess!

814
00:51:46,506 --> 00:51:49,593
With cat-like tread,
upon our prey we steal

815
00:51:49,508 --> 00:51:51,885
In silence dread,
our cautious way we feel

816
00:51:51,828 --> 00:51:55,289
No sound at all,
we never speak a word

817
00:51:58,350 --> 00:52:01,728
Did you find the princess, boy?

818
00:52:01,632 --> 00:52:02,967
Good work, Pluto.

819
00:52:02,952 --> 00:52:06,247
Our brave musketeers
have come to rescue us.

820
00:52:06,153 --> 00:52:07,488
Don't worry, Your Highness.

821
00:52:07,473 --> 00:52:08,725
We'll save you.

822
00:52:08,714 --> 00:52:11,509
Alright, you two,
drop the princess!

823
00:52:11,435 --> 00:52:12,854
With pleasure.

824
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:27,937
Poor wandering ones

825
00:52:29,722 --> 00:52:32,183
...Can help you find
true peace of mind...

826
00:52:38,366 --> 00:52:40,660
What?

827
00:52:40,607 --> 00:52:43,234
What the sam hill?

828
00:52:43,167 --> 00:52:44,877
The princess!

829
00:52:44,848 --> 00:52:46,558
Do something!

830
00:52:46,528 --> 00:52:48,614
Sir. Yes, sir.

831
00:52:48,570 --> 00:52:50,405
Scaling rough
and rugged passes

832
00:52:50,370 --> 00:52:52,372
Climb the hearty
little lasses

833
00:52:52,331 --> 00:52:54,708
Till the bright sea-shore
they gain

834
00:52:54,652 --> 00:52:57,613
How dare you try
and kidnap the princess!

835
00:52:57,533 --> 00:52:59,493
Nobody walks away
with the princess...

836
00:52:59,453 --> 00:53:01,413
while Mickey, Donald,
and Goofy are on the job!

837
00:53:01,374 --> 00:53:04,752
Hey! Someone's walking away
with the princess.

838
00:53:04,655 --> 00:53:06,115
Let's get 'em!

839
00:53:12,259 --> 00:53:14,177
I am the very model
of a modern major-general

840
00:53:14,139 --> 00:53:17,350
I've information
vegetable, animal... historical

841
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:19,179
From Marathon to Waterloo
in order categorical

842
00:53:19,141 --> 00:53:21,185
I'm very well acquainted, too,
with matters mathematical

843
00:53:21,142 --> 00:53:23,227
I understand equations,
both the simple and quadratical

844
00:53:23,183 --> 00:53:25,685
About binomial theorem,
I am teeming with a lot of news

845
00:53:25,623 --> 00:53:28,084
With many cheerful facts about
the square of the hypotenuse

846
00:53:36,467 --> 00:53:39,762
She's getting away!

847
00:53:39,669 --> 00:53:41,212
I am the very model

848
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:42,482
Of a modern major-general

849
00:53:52,914 --> 00:53:54,457
Princess!

850
00:54:00,556 --> 00:54:01,599
Ouch.

851
00:54:16,363 --> 00:54:19,825
Two down, and one to go.

852
00:54:19,723 --> 00:54:23,227
I almost got it.

853
00:54:23,126 --> 00:54:25,586
Oh, no! Look out!

854
00:54:25,526 --> 00:54:26,777
What?

855
00:54:26,767 --> 00:54:32,356
This is it, squeaky...
mano y mouse-o.

856
00:55:05,261 --> 00:55:08,181
It's all over, Mickey...

857
00:55:08,102 --> 00:55:10,730
and you're all alone.

858
00:55:10,663 --> 00:55:13,540
And now with you
finally out of the way...

859
00:55:13,464 --> 00:55:19,428
getting rid of the princess
will be easy as pie.

860
00:55:22,107 --> 00:55:23,650
Want to bet?

861
00:55:23,628 --> 00:55:25,046
That's a sucker bet.

862
00:55:25,029 --> 00:55:28,282
Yeah, and you're the sucker!

863
00:55:30,070 --> 00:55:31,905
Ready, musketeers?

864
00:55:31,871 --> 00:55:35,291
All for one and one for all.

865
00:55:36,633 --> 00:55:38,468
How's this for a coward?

866
00:55:39,674 --> 00:55:41,384
How's this for a doofus?

867
00:55:43,276 --> 00:55:45,069
And I may be small, Pete...

868
00:55:45,036 --> 00:55:49,248
but I've got friends
that make me ten feet tall.

869
00:55:49,118 --> 00:55:50,411
Aw, nuts.

870
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:56,738
Timber!

871
00:55:56,721 --> 00:55:59,432
I hate happy endings.

872
00:56:21,450 --> 00:56:26,580
Daisy. Are you kissing
a commoner?

873
00:56:26,412 --> 00:56:28,038
C'est la vie.

874
00:56:29,133 --> 00:56:32,011
C'est I'amore!

875
00:56:53,022 --> 00:56:54,398
Please kneel.

876
00:56:56,103 --> 00:56:59,899
In gratitude
for saving France...

877
00:56:59,784 --> 00:57:04,789
I hereby dub thee,
Mickey, Donald, and Goofy...

878
00:57:04,626 --> 00:57:08,296
all royal musketeers!

879
00:57:09,308 --> 00:57:11,268
What do you say, everybody?

880
00:57:11,229 --> 00:57:12,522
All for one...

881
00:57:12,509 --> 00:57:15,221
And one for all!

882
00:57:16,910 --> 00:57:18,704
Bravo, my friends!

883
00:57:18,672 --> 00:57:21,675
Our three heroes
have finally...

884
00:57:21,592 --> 00:57:24,428
made their dream come true.

885
00:57:24,353 --> 00:57:26,564
I think this calls for...

886
00:57:26,514 --> 00:57:29,559
one more song!

887
00:57:29,476 --> 00:57:32,062
All for one, hey,
all for one and one for all

888
00:57:31,996 --> 00:57:35,375
Musketeers sing
all for one and one for all

889
00:57:35,277 --> 00:57:37,363
And all for one
and one for all

890
00:57:37,318 --> 00:57:41,614
And all for one and all

891
00:57:41,615 --> 00:57:49,615
