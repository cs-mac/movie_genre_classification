1
00:00:33,152 --> 00:00:35,674
- Hello?
- Craig? I saw her again.

2
00:00:35,804 --> 00:00:37,848
At the beach this time.

3
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:39,979
- Who?
- Her.

4
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,023
- Her?
- Her her.

5
00:00:42,154 --> 00:00:46,285
Oh, the mystery girl. So
you followed her to the beach?

6
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:48,460
No. She just appeared.

7
00:00:49,287 --> 00:00:51,939
looked over and there she was

8
00:00:52,069 --> 00:00:55,808
On her upper lip, there was
this tiny bead of sweat.

9
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:59,548
It was her only flaw
and I loved her for it.

10
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,332
All right. Now what did you do?

11
00:01:02,463 --> 00:01:06,028
How did you, Tom McHugh,
take control of the situation?

12
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,637
How did you seize the
moment and make it yours?

13
00:01:09,768 --> 00:01:12,464
- I waited.
- you waited? For what?

14
00:01:14,856 --> 00:01:16,899
For the perfect moment.

15
00:01:17,031 --> 00:01:19,466
For the moment our eyes would meet

16
00:01:19,596 --> 00:01:24,944
and she'd smile at me and there'd be a flash
of unspoken understanding between us.

17
00:01:27,033 --> 00:01:29,076
I was waiting for fate.

18
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:34,729
Tell me something, pal.

19
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:36,774
How long does all this take?

20
00:01:36,904 --> 00:01:39,209
Hey, don't rush me.

21
00:01:39,339 --> 00:01:41,556
When the moment's right, I'll know.

22
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:45,776
It'll happen. It'll happen.

23
00:01:48,255 --> 00:01:51,473
- Did the landscaper come?
- On Wednesday.

24
00:01:51,603 --> 00:01:55,864
- Dr Lunsky, Mrs Lunsky.
- Craig, I thought you were in law school.

25
00:01:55,995 --> 00:01:59,604
Tom. Craig's winsome younger brother.

26
00:01:59,779 --> 00:02:04,518
- you win some, you lose some!
- Remind me never to let you operate on me.

27
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:09,041
# If you need a Little lovin'#

28
00:02:11,433 --> 00:02:13,824
Suzette, this is my son Tom.

29
00:02:13,955 --> 00:02:15,650
Hi, Tom.

30
00:02:15,782 --> 00:02:18,347
Tom's going to Yale
to study Business.

31
00:02:18,478 --> 00:02:22,086
Or I might join the merchant
marines. I haven't decided.

32
00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:27,523
# Oh I'll be right here at home

33
00:02:28,611 --> 00:02:33,002
# All you gotta do Is pick
up your telephone and dial#

34
00:02:33,134 --> 00:02:38,047
I say, take a couple of years,
figure out what to do with your life.

35
00:02:38,177 --> 00:02:42,395
Yeah, a young man should follow
his heart wherever it takes him.

36
00:02:42,527 --> 00:02:46,005
Don't let us old coots
dictate what you should do.

37
00:02:46,137 --> 00:02:50,180
Of course, as an employer, I have
a bias against hiring slack-offs.

38
00:02:50,312 --> 00:02:51,572
# Yeah

39
00:02:51,703 --> 00:02:53,920
4-5-7-8-9

40
00:02:54,051 --> 00:02:55,703
# Call me on the telephone

41
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:58,529
3-4-5-7-8-9

42
00:02:59,487 --> 00:03:01,573
3-4-5

43
00:03:01,705 --> 00:03:05,227
As you all know, by
this time tomorrow,

44
00:03:05,357 --> 00:03:10,922
Betty and I will be in Connecticut along
with a very special member of our family.

45
00:03:11,054 --> 00:03:15,836
For four years, he has competed
amongst the very best of the nation and

46
00:03:15,968 --> 00:03:18,142
each time, he's come home a champion.

47
00:03:18,273 --> 00:03:21,882
I know how grateful he is
for your generous support,

48
00:03:22,013 --> 00:03:27,622
but I think he could say it more eloquently
than I, so what do you say, champ?

49
00:03:33,276 --> 00:03:36,102
# For he's a jolly good schnauzer

50
00:03:36,233 --> 00:03:38,450
# For he's a jolly good schnauzer

51
00:03:39,017 --> 00:03:42,582
# For he's a jolly good schnauzer#

52
00:03:42,714 --> 00:03:46,192
# Which nobody can deny

53
00:03:46,323 --> 00:03:48,627
# Which nobody can deny... #

54
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,368
# Only child know#

55
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:05,239
Saratoga Longshot?

56
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:10,935
# But we're never
gonna survive unless#

57
00:04:11,109 --> 00:04:14,587
There must be a way to
find out more about her.

58
00:04:16,676 --> 00:04:21,242
# No we're never gonna survive unless

59
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:23,764
# We are a Little

60
00:04:25,809 --> 00:04:28,026
# Crazy#

61
00:04:33,071 --> 00:04:35,158
Hello?

62
00:04:35,289 --> 00:04:37,376
Hi, Mom.

63
00:04:37,508 --> 00:04:39,942
No, no, I canceled.

64
00:04:41,509 --> 00:04:44,595
I know he's a doctor,
but he's still boring.

65
00:04:48,075 --> 00:04:50,162
Then you go out with him.

66
00:04:52,249 --> 00:04:54,336
I'd rather be by myself.

67
00:04:54,467 --> 00:04:57,380
Hang on a second, I
heard something outside.

68
00:05:03,859 --> 00:05:07,338
Tom, there's a couple of frozen pizzas
in the icebox downstairs

69
00:05:07,469 --> 00:05:09,817
and a fresh case of Bock beer.

70
00:05:09,948 --> 00:05:12,079
- Keep your damn hands off it.
- Yes, sir.

71
00:05:12,253 --> 00:05:16,035
And don't forget about that
list of chores we agreed on.

72
00:05:16,168 --> 00:05:18,037
Please, get yourself a nice haircut.

73
00:05:21,081 --> 00:05:24,211
- See you guys when you get back.
- you bet.

74
00:05:25,517 --> 00:05:27,386
Buckle up, hon.

75
00:05:30,648 --> 00:05:31,996
Aren't you forgetting something?

76
00:05:32,126 --> 00:05:35,257
Mom, I'm not gonna kiss the dog.

77
00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:38,085
Goodbye, dear.

78
00:05:40,303 --> 00:05:42,607
"Clean your room,

79
00:05:42,781 --> 00:05:45,434
hang out the clothes,
mow the lawn... "

80
00:06:11,873 --> 00:06:15,047
- Craig.
- Hey, buddy!

81
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,267
I thought you were in California.

82
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:21,528
Well, I decided to fly
up and surprise you.

83
00:06:21,659 --> 00:06:24,659
No kidding. We haven't
seen you in ages.

84
00:06:24,789 --> 00:06:29,268
- you know Mom and Dad took off?
- Yeah. When are they coming back?

85
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:31,138
- Monday night.
- Terrific.

86
00:06:31,269 --> 00:06:32,747
This is beautiful.

87
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:37,618
1959 DeSoto Firesweep.

88
00:06:37,793 --> 00:06:41,359
See the way it leans into the
wind. That's the "forward look".

89
00:06:41,489 --> 00:06:47,098
When this baby came out, the
ad said, "Suddenly, it's 1960."

90
00:06:47,229 --> 00:06:49,403
Wanna take it for a spin?

91
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:54,708
- Can I?
- No. but you can pull it into the garage.

92
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,666
It's a push-button transmission.

93
00:06:59,796 --> 00:07:02,014
D for drive, R for reverse.

94
00:07:02,145 --> 00:07:04,058
Where's the P?

95
00:07:06,538 --> 00:07:08,929
No Park. Parking brake.

96
00:07:28,237 --> 00:07:33,150
- How did you get it here if you just flew in?
- What?

97
00:07:33,283 --> 00:07:36,283
How did you get the
car here from California?

98
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:40,936
Chris Keslin drove it up during
spring break. Grab that bag.

99
00:07:41,066 --> 00:07:44,023
Any beer inside? you look
like you could use one.

100
00:07:44,154 --> 00:07:49,372
- Yeah, but Dad said...
- "Hands off it!" Forget it. Tell him I drank it.

101
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,764
It's good to see you, Craig.

102
00:07:55,548 --> 00:07:58,982
I see you've been putting
my telescope to good use.

103
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,592
Tom, Tom!

104
00:08:03,722 --> 00:08:06,809
Is the telescope inadvertently
pointing at something interesting?

105
00:08:06,941 --> 00:08:10,723
Is this the one you told me
about? Your new girlfriend?

106
00:08:10,856 --> 00:08:12,334
I'm working on that.

107
00:08:14,204 --> 00:08:16,291
Tommy, come here. Come here.

108
00:08:19,074 --> 00:08:22,683
I want you to look through
this telescope. Go ahead.

109
00:08:22,814 --> 00:08:26,727
It's pointing at a
beautiful woman. Why?

110
00:08:26,858 --> 00:08:29,554
Because you pointed it there, huh?

111
00:08:29,686 --> 00:08:33,295
Not Mom, not Dad, not
anybody else but you.

112
00:08:33,425 --> 00:08:37,686
you know what you want. The hard
part is over. Do something about it.

113
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:40,991
- I haven't even spoken to her!
- That's all right.

114
00:08:41,123 --> 00:08:43,210
That's all right.

115
00:08:44,253 --> 00:08:46,558
What do you know about this girl?

116
00:08:46,689 --> 00:08:49,211
She's house-sitting
for some new neighbors.

117
00:08:49,341 --> 00:08:52,254
She reads mystery novels.
She doesn't seem to have a boyfriend.

118
00:08:52,386 --> 00:08:54,907
Oh, Tom, she's waiting for you.

119
00:08:55,038 --> 00:08:59,994
Fine, I'll go over and say,
"Hi, I'm Tom. you don't know me,

120
00:09:00,126 --> 00:09:02,387
but I've been spying on you
for a couple of months

121
00:09:02,517 --> 00:09:06,430
and I find you very attractive
in a very hormonal way. "

122
00:09:06,562 --> 00:09:08,692
Then she'll slap me silly.

123
00:09:10,129 --> 00:09:14,129
There are worse things than getting
slapped by a beautiful woman.

124
00:09:14,259 --> 00:09:17,520
- Got her phone number?
- I don't even know her name!

125
00:09:17,695 --> 00:09:20,217
but you've got her garbage, right?

126
00:09:25,044 --> 00:09:28,870
She's got a couple of Gourmet
Lites. Couscous, grapefruit rinds.

127
00:09:29,002 --> 00:09:31,828
you've got to get
this girl some food.

128
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,308
Hello!

129
00:09:37,351 --> 00:09:39,612
Tom, meet Geena Mathews.

130
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:45,700
In July, Geena bought S85-worth
of lingerie at Nordstrom.

131
00:09:45,831 --> 00:09:49,397
Very nice. Do you like lingerie, Tommy?

132
00:09:49,528 --> 00:09:51,832
I've really only read about it.

133
00:09:51,963 --> 00:09:56,006
Let's see. She reads mystery
novels to escape, right?

134
00:09:56,138 --> 00:10:00,268
She dreams of faraway, exotic places.

135
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,573
She's into surrealism.

136
00:10:02,704 --> 00:10:04,660
She's trapped, Tom.

137
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,184
- Bingo.
- She plays bingo?

138
00:10:10,315 --> 00:10:15,489
Phone bill. Now we have her phone
number. Let's go rescue her.

139
00:10:20,925 --> 00:10:23,012
Craig...

140
00:10:24,535 --> 00:10:26,883
- No, I can't do this!
- Be yourself.

141
00:10:27,014 --> 00:10:28,927
- I can't.
- Then be me.

142
00:10:30,014 --> 00:10:31,058
No.

143
00:10:31,189 --> 00:10:33,102
Hello?

144
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:34,972
Hello?

145
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:39,667
Hello. Geena? Is this Geena Matthews?

146
00:10:40,712 --> 00:10:42,495
Hi. My name is Tom.

147
00:10:44,191 --> 00:10:46,235
No, no. Tom McHugh.

148
00:10:47,452 --> 00:10:49,496
That's because we've never met.

149
00:10:49,627 --> 00:10:52,410
I'm a neighbour. I live on Sunnydale.

150
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,106
I don't name the streets,
just live on them.

151
00:10:57,237 --> 00:11:00,889
Listen, I keep seeing
you everywhere I go.

152
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,890
First it was at
Nordstrom, then the beach.

153
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:07,629
Then at that Dali exhibit
over at the museum.

154
00:11:07,761 --> 00:11:13,631
I had to call to ask you to please stop
following me around. People are starting to talk.

155
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:16,458
Oh, you know, us.

156
00:11:17,894 --> 00:11:21,198
Listen, Geena, to be
totally honest with you,

157
00:11:21,329 --> 00:11:24,111
I'm trying my hardest
to ask you out.

158
00:11:25,157 --> 00:11:27,635
It's gonna be a beautiful night.

159
00:11:27,765 --> 00:11:33,157
It's gonna be one of those hot, tropical
nights where anything could happen.

160
00:11:35,463 --> 00:11:37,854
I fly back to California tomorrow.

161
00:11:39,854 --> 00:11:43,941
Listen, what about this? What
if I come to your house at 07.30?

162
00:11:44,073 --> 00:11:48,551
If you don't open the door, I'll
leave, promise. What do you say?

163
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:52,639
Great. Bye.

164
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:56,597
- We're in.
- I'm not doing this. Call back!

165
00:11:56,683 --> 00:12:01,988
- you just have to show up!
- What if I blow it? This is too spontaneous.

166
00:12:02,119 --> 00:12:06,771
- I need more time.
- Tiger, tiger, come on. Relax.

167
00:12:07,817 --> 00:12:10,991
Trust me, you'll be ready.

168
00:12:11,122 --> 00:12:16,948
I want you to remember what Lord Olivier
said about acting, "The key is sincerity. "

169
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,949
Once you can fake that,
the rest is easy.

170
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,645
George Burns said that.

171
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,909
OK, I want you to clean it up.

172
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:33,083
but not too severe.

173
00:12:33,258 --> 00:12:36,084
Think... Robert Mitchum.

174
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:38,432
N Out Of he Past

175
00:12:38,563 --> 00:12:41,041
So basically, exactly
like yours. Right?

176
00:12:41,172 --> 00:12:42,911
Yeah.

177
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:45,954
Craig, listen, first
dates don't work for me.

178
00:12:46,086 --> 00:12:48,781
I hurry my jokes, I have car trouble.

179
00:12:48,912 --> 00:12:54,173
Once I took a bite of pizza, the
hot stuff slid off and burnt me.

180
00:12:54,304 --> 00:12:56,391
Tommy, you're trying too hard.

181
00:12:56,523 --> 00:12:58,566
Let her do the work, huh?

182
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:02,914
What do women like to do more
than anything in the world?

183
00:13:03,046 --> 00:13:04,655
Buy shoes?

184
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:08,438
Talk. They talk. So you listen.

185
00:13:08,569 --> 00:13:11,830
That is the most
important thing about women.

186
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:18,047
They like it when you treat 'em shitty and when you treat 'em well
- they just want your attention.

187
00:13:23,311 --> 00:13:25,181
Does it matter that
I have 20-20 vision?

188
00:13:25,312 --> 00:13:28,530
- I don't need glasses!
- Hey, neither do I.

189
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:33,617
If women say they like mature guys,
it means they like men in glasses.

190
00:13:33,748 --> 00:13:35,835
It's the only difference.

191
00:13:44,706 --> 00:13:49,446
The only problem with glasses is
they fly off when a woman slaps you.

192
00:13:49,577 --> 00:13:53,447
Don't flinch, take it like
a man. Come off it smiling.

193
00:13:53,577 --> 00:13:56,403
- I don't usually get slapped.
- Really?

194
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:58,752
Happens to me all the time.

195
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:00,100
Come on.

196
00:14:00,232 --> 00:14:04,450
A limo? No way am I showing
up in a stupid limo!

197
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:08,363
Your convertible would be perfect.
I promise I'll be extra careful.

198
00:14:09,581 --> 00:14:13,016
you're right. It would be very cool.

199
00:14:14,147 --> 00:14:17,669
but I can't. Really, Tom, it's
been giving me trouble lately.

200
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,192
The top stick s, the
exhaust system...

201
00:14:20,323 --> 00:14:24,714
Why risk it, huh? I was
hoping to borrow your car.

202
00:14:24,846 --> 00:14:28,629
- My car? - Yeah, visit
some of my old hang-outs.

203
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:36,238
Everything at Kory's is terrific.

204
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:38,283
Except for the wine list.

205
00:14:38,413 --> 00:14:42,631
Just wave your hand and say, "A
bottle of your best Champagne. "

206
00:14:42,762 --> 00:14:47,284
"A bottle of your best Champagne?"
How am I supposed to afford Champagne?

207
00:14:47,415 --> 00:14:49,893
This is brand new.

208
00:14:50,024 --> 00:14:54,198
Sign my name so the
signatures match.

209
00:14:54,329 --> 00:14:57,677
And I will give you some
extra cash for tipping.

210
00:14:58,722 --> 00:15:00,853
Always tip well.

211
00:15:02,722 --> 00:15:05,114
but only when your date is watching.

212
00:15:08,723 --> 00:15:14,158
Hi. I have a flower delivery
for a Mr, uh... McHugh.

213
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:17,811
you're 20 minutes late... Dwight.

214
00:15:17,944 --> 00:15:20,770
I'm sorry, sir. I
misjudged the ride over.

215
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,118
I usually take a different route.

216
00:15:23,293 --> 00:15:26,206
That is a beautiful car.

217
00:15:26,336 --> 00:15:28,554
Don't make excuses on my time.

218
00:15:29,598 --> 00:15:34,076
I have an important date planned this
evening and you've fucked it up.

219
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:37,295
Oh, wow. I said I was sorry.

220
00:15:38,295 --> 00:15:40,556
Well, there goes your tip, Dwight.

221
00:15:40,687 --> 00:15:42,817
There goes my tip?

222
00:15:42,948 --> 00:15:45,165
I hope you enjoy the flowers.

223
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:49,384
Craig?

224
00:15:56,778 --> 00:15:58,734
This is insane.

225
00:15:59,778 --> 00:16:04,561
What if she hates me, or
laughs at me? Or pulls a knife?

226
00:16:04,692 --> 00:16:07,170
- Pulls a knife? -
Worst-case scenario.

227
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,301
Roe ax

228
00:16:10,432 --> 00:16:13,258
Stick to the plan.
Everything will be fine.

229
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,693
Remember, no woman wants to hear,

230
00:16:15,825 --> 00:16:17,912
"What do you want to do?"

231
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:21,304
you have reservations and
directions. Everything's taken care of.

232
00:16:21,435 --> 00:16:24,609
- you need to wear this jacket.
- you think so?

233
00:16:24,739 --> 00:16:26,392
Yep.

234
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:48,874
Oh, no, oh, no. Don't do this to me.

235
00:16:55,486 --> 00:16:58,051
I'm sorry, man! I'm really late.

236
00:16:58,181 --> 00:16:59,920
Hey, come back here!

237
00:17:03,704 --> 00:17:07,661
This is inspiring.
you look almost like me.

238
00:17:08,618 --> 00:17:11,009
It's perverse.

239
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,183
I gotta get going.

240
00:17:14,272 --> 00:17:19,794
My wallet's in here, all right? Hold onto
that. There's cash in there and my ID.

241
00:17:19,925 --> 00:17:26,969
- Isn't phoney ID against the law?
- Don't let the law stand in the way of fun.

242
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:30,405
you're gonna make a
great lawyer, Craig.

243
00:17:30,536 --> 00:17:32,623
And you're a good brother.

244
00:17:57,758 --> 00:17:59,498
- Yes?
- Mr McHugh?

245
00:17:59,629 --> 00:18:01,890
About that limousine you ordered...

246
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:06,368
There's been an accident. We can
get you another in a few hours.

247
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,065
No, tonight's a special occasion.

248
00:18:09,239 --> 00:18:12,413
Of course, otherwise you
would have rented a Chevette.

249
00:18:12,545 --> 00:18:17,023
I'm picking her up in a few minutes!
Now what am I supposed to do?

250
00:18:27,504 --> 00:18:32,286
# No one can take this away from me

251
00:18:34,897 --> 00:18:38,766
# The martyrs and madmen
I learned that in school

252
00:18:38,897 --> 00:18:41,419
# Will remember my name

253
00:18:43,376 --> 00:18:47,246
# Some things are never the same

254
00:19:24,081 --> 00:19:26,776
McHugh. Tom McHugh right here.

255
00:20:02,611 --> 00:20:03,698
Hi.

256
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:06,480
- You're Tom?
- I'm Tom.

257
00:20:07,699 --> 00:20:09,872
These are flowers. They're for you.

258
00:20:10,917 --> 00:20:14,526
- I'll put them in some water.
- Just the bottom part.

259
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,658
Listen, Thanks for the
flowers, they're great.

260
00:20:26,789 --> 00:20:29,616
Um... but I wanna ask
you a few questions.

261
00:20:29,746 --> 00:20:32,137
Right, of course. I understand.

262
00:20:32,269 --> 00:20:35,877
Tell me the name of the
last novel you read.

263
00:20:36,051 --> 00:20:38,269
Novel?

264
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,791
Yeah, a story book without pictures.

265
00:20:42,619 --> 00:20:44,314
Oh, right, uh...

266
00:20:45,358 --> 00:20:47,271
It's just that it was...

267
00:20:47,402 --> 00:20:49,924
It was this mystery
novel, Saratoga Longshot

268
00:20:50,968 --> 00:20:53,794
Are you kidding? I just read that.

269
00:20:53,926 --> 00:20:55,535
Really?

270
00:20:55,665 --> 00:20:58,882
OK... what's the capital of Paraguay?

271
00:20:59,013 --> 00:21:01,317
Uruguay?

272
00:21:01,449 --> 00:21:04,318
No, it's Asuncion. but
nobody ever gets that.

273
00:21:05,624 --> 00:21:07,884
Um... any personal heroes?

274
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,755
...?

275
00:21:11,147 --> 00:21:14,713
I always looked up to
my older brother Craig.

276
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,627
but that's kinda stupid.

277
00:21:23,758 --> 00:21:25,497
Really?

278
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:28,323
that's so sweet

279
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:31,584
Most guys say Michael Jordan.

280
00:21:46,633 --> 00:21:49,198
Wait, I'm sitting on something.

281
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,332
- This is a cool car.
- Thanks.

282
00:22:09,464 --> 00:22:12,507
It's funny what some
guys think is impressive.

283
00:22:12,638 --> 00:22:16,464
- One date showed up in a limo.
- you're kidding?

284
00:22:17,508 --> 00:22:21,552
I just think this
is more interesting.

285
00:22:21,683 --> 00:22:26,031
- It's a 1959, uh, DeSoto.
- DeSoto?

286
00:22:26,161 --> 00:22:27,205
Yeah.

287
00:22:29,554 --> 00:22:31,380
# Doo-do-do

# And the world seems to disappear

# All the problems all the fears

297
00:22:56,473 --> 00:22:59,299
Um, by the way, where are we going?

298
00:23:00,081 --> 00:23:03,864
It's just up ahead here.
I'm pretty sure, uh...

299
00:23:03,996 --> 00:23:05,909
it's a place called Kory's

300
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,518
# Do-doo

# Say you're mine

305
00:23:17,477 --> 00:23:22,042
# And give yourself to
the feelings that you know

306
00:23:23,391 --> 00:23:27,130
# I'm needing all that you can give me

307
00:23:27,261 --> 00:23:30,479
# All the things that you do so well

308
00:24:03,704 --> 00:24:06,182
Wow! How did you find this place?

309
00:24:06,314 --> 00:24:10,488
I don't know. you just
hear about places and then...

310
00:24:10,618 --> 00:24:12,531
you go there.

311
00:24:14,532 --> 00:24:16,271
So...

312
00:24:16,402 --> 00:24:18,489
uhm...

313
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:22,751
I forgot what I was going to say.

314
00:24:23,969 --> 00:24:27,056
It was something really enchanting.

315
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:32,012
Tom? Maybe we should skip this
first-impression thing. What do you say?

316
00:24:32,144 --> 00:24:36,926
Great idea. I've always thought fourth
impressions were the most important.

317
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:42,275
First dates, people try so
hard, they can't be themselves.

318
00:24:42,408 --> 00:24:44,538
Yeah, I know.

319
00:24:44,669 --> 00:24:46,582
It's almost deceptive really.

320
00:24:46,713 --> 00:24:50,930
I mean, we spend hours making
ourselves look completely different,

321
00:24:51,061 --> 00:24:54,800
then we go to some dark place
and can't see each other.

322
00:24:54,931 --> 00:24:58,149
We drink, so we don't know if
the person is interesting,

323
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:03,802
or seems interesting because they're pretending
to be interested in who we're pretending to be.

324
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:05,803
Right.

325
00:25:05,934 --> 00:25:08,804
So I guess there's
no getting around it.

326
00:25:08,934 --> 00:25:13,804
- We're gonna have to lie to each other.
- Lie to each other?

327
00:25:13,935 --> 00:25:16,109
Until we get to know one another.

328
00:25:16,241 --> 00:25:22,328
OK. Two Cabana Coolers.
I'll put that on your tab.

329
00:25:22,459 --> 00:25:25,155
- Tab?
- Yeah.

330
00:25:25,285 --> 00:25:27,764
My tab O K

331
00:25:28,808 --> 00:25:30,504
Thank you.

332
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:44,289
I've wet myself and you'll wanna
call my mother to take me home.

333
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:50,594
Tom, it's all right. If this is the worst
thing that happens all night, we'll live.

334
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:52,726
I'm gonna be right back.

335
00:25:57,249 --> 00:25:59,901
- Hi. Stella?
- Hi.

336
00:26:00,032 --> 00:26:02,598
Do you have a towel?

337
00:26:02,729 --> 00:26:07,207
Well. I see the old McHugh charm
is overflowing this evening.

338
00:26:09,295 --> 00:26:13,426
- Stella!
- Ah, duty calls. I live to serve.

339
00:26:16,731 --> 00:26:20,209
- That wasn't Craig McHugh, was it?
- Get in line, honey.

340
00:26:24,993 --> 00:26:27,515
It's his car, no mistake.

341
00:26:27,646 --> 00:26:29,733
I'm gonna check it out.

342
00:26:34,951 --> 00:26:37,908
- How are you this evening?
- Beautiful car.

343
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,127
Thank you.

344
00:26:53,086 --> 00:26:55,260
Shit!

345
00:26:56,957 --> 00:27:00,957
- So the rat returns to his hole.
- Do we know each other?

346
00:27:01,089 --> 00:27:03,002
I wasn't that drunk!

347
00:27:04,176 --> 00:27:07,350
How you can live with
yourself, Craig McHugh!

348
00:27:08,394 --> 00:27:10,133
I don't... I'm not...

349
00:27:12,221 --> 00:27:15,091
Hey, Mr Romeo, I hate dick s like you.

350
00:27:15,221 --> 00:27:20,047
- What did he do?
- Forget it. His karma will catch up with him.

351
00:27:20,179 --> 00:27:23,353
She's right. When it
does, it'll kick my ass.

352
00:27:29,006 --> 00:27:31,223
Hi. Do you like your drink?

353
00:27:32,268 --> 00:27:36,442
- Yeah, it's kind of...
- Could you tell me in the car?

354
00:27:37,052 --> 00:27:38,661
What's the big hurry?

355
00:27:38,792 --> 00:27:41,965
Um, I ran into some
old school buddies.

356
00:27:42,097 --> 00:27:47,097
- They'll bung us all night if we hang around.
- Hey, you clown!

357
00:27:47,228 --> 00:27:49,707
I thought that was a great place.

358
00:27:49,837 --> 00:27:51,533
Yeah, yeah.

359
00:27:51,663 --> 00:27:55,533
- Do you mind if we go someplace else?
- No, it's fine.

360
00:27:55,665 --> 00:27:58,056
Leave the girl here!

361
00:27:58,187 --> 00:28:01,187
These guys, they're... kook s.

362
00:28:06,276 --> 00:28:08,015
Interesting friends.

363
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:11,232
Well, you know,
they're just jealous.

364
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:17,146
I mean, here I am out with a
beautiful Pulitzer Prize winner.

365
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:20,756
Come on, Tom, enough lies, OK?

366
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:25,366
Absolutely. No more lies.

367
00:28:29,236 --> 00:28:31,758
What happened to your face? It's red.

368
00:28:32,803 --> 00:28:35,063
Oh... Oh, that. It's, uhm...

369
00:28:36,108 --> 00:28:39,630
It's an allergic reaction
to pineapple juice.

370
00:28:42,239 --> 00:28:44,761
Uh-oh. Are those
your buddies again?

371
00:28:44,891 --> 00:28:48,370
No. He's from the flower
shop near my house.

372
00:28:53,981 --> 00:28:56,242
- Did you screw her yet?
- What?

373
00:28:57,287 --> 00:29:00,069
Get her drunk with my tip money?

374
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,026
- What did he say?
- I didn't catch him.

375
00:29:09,984 --> 00:29:11,897
Here!

376
00:29:12,028 --> 00:29:14,245
Bang her with these!

377
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,290
I still can't hear him.

378
00:29:20,899 --> 00:29:23,856
Hey, lady! I hope you
don't expect a tip.

379
00:29:24,813 --> 00:29:27,465
Argh!

380
00:29:34,424 --> 00:29:36,511
He was kinda funny, wasn't he?

381
00:29:45,339 --> 00:29:49,557
you're so romantic. Or do you
throw flowers at all your dates?

382
00:29:49,688 --> 00:29:51,384
No.

383
00:29:51,515 --> 00:29:55,341
I can't wait to see what
you throw at me next.

384
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:59,255
I'll be right back.

385
00:30:13,128 --> 00:30:14,867
Excuse me?

386
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:17,606
Is there a washroom?

387
00:30:22,607 --> 00:30:24,607
Nice form.

388
00:30:27,739 --> 00:30:30,043
- Hey, nice car.
- Oh, Thanks.

389
00:30:30,174 --> 00:30:33,261
58? No, 59 DeSoto firesweep

390
00:30:33,393 --> 00:30:37,958
- Wow. you look great with it too.
- Thanks.

391
00:30:38,872 --> 00:30:41,959
- Could you do something for me?
- What's that?

392
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:45,090
Just kinda mean-lean
against it there?

393
00:30:46,656 --> 00:30:49,221
- What, like this?
- Yeah. Yeah, that's great.

394
00:30:50,266 --> 00:30:52,571
put the other hand right there.

395
00:30:54,224 --> 00:30:56,441
- What, like this?
- Perfect!

396
00:30:56,572 --> 00:31:01,615
Don't move an inch. I'm Detective Condon and
I am your arresting officer this evening.

397
00:31:01,747 --> 00:31:05,138
- Is this a joke?
- The joke is over, son.

398
00:31:10,313 --> 00:31:12,530
So you're Craig McHugh, huh?

399
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:15,183
No, I'm not. He's my brother.

400
00:31:15,314 --> 00:31:17,401
Your evil twin brother, right?

401
00:31:17,532 --> 00:31:19,576
No, he's older. An older evil...

402
00:31:19,706 --> 00:31:22,141
My brother is practically a lawyer, OK?

403
00:31:22,271 --> 00:31:24,532
you may need one.

404
00:31:26,533 --> 00:31:28,620
That you, Sharpie? It's Condon.

405
00:31:28,753 --> 00:31:31,492
- Did somebody say "condom"?
- Go ahead, make jokes.

406
00:31:31,622 --> 00:31:33,883
I got him. I got McHugh.

407
00:31:34,013 --> 00:31:37,144
I said to wait for
backup. What's with you?

408
00:31:37,275 --> 00:31:39,362
He's not armed. He's
practically crying.

409
00:31:39,493 --> 00:31:42,927
I want you to wait
there. We're on our way.

410
00:31:43,102 --> 00:31:46,928
OK, McHugh, it's time
to hand over the flowerpot.

411
00:31:47,104 --> 00:31:53,061
- I got flowers...
- I want it now. I've got no time for this crap.

412
00:31:53,192 --> 00:31:56,410
you took the vase.
Where is it? The trunk?

413
00:31:56,540 --> 00:32:01,192
you look in the trunk, take whatever
you want. you got the jack...

414
00:32:16,414 --> 00:32:17,849
Hello?

415
00:32:17,979 --> 00:32:20,066
Sir?

416
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:23,850
Oh, oh...

417
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:28,677
Come on, come on.

418
00:33:08,642 --> 00:33:10,599
Hi. Is everything all right?

419
00:33:17,382 --> 00:33:19,469
you look kinda pale. Are you sure
you're OK?

420
00:33:19,601 --> 00:33:21,775
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

421
00:33:23,122 --> 00:33:26,557
Oh, good. Cos I'm having a great time.

422
00:33:27,777 --> 00:33:29,211
you are?

423
00:33:31,691 --> 00:33:33,299
Yeah.

424
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:41,734
I hate to cut our date short. but
you're going to California tomorrow, right?

425
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:46,954
Yeah, right. you see,
it's just that...

426
00:33:48,521 --> 00:33:53,216
I'm a little worried
about... about my car.

427
00:33:53,347 --> 00:33:54,912
I'm having some car trouble.

428
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,087
I'll go pay, OK?

429
00:34:15,351 --> 00:34:18,525
Did you forget something?
No, it's  OK

430
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:21,656
- I got it.
- Can I help?

431
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:38,834
Um...

432
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:41,660
I had a nosebleed.

433
00:34:41,793 --> 00:34:44,097
That's disgusting!

434
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:51,141
Keep the change.

435
00:34:51,272 --> 00:34:53,228
Do you have a payphone?

436
00:34:54,708 --> 00:34:55,751
On the wall.

437
00:35:02,796 --> 00:35:04,839
- Hi, I'm Richard.
- I'm Betty.

438
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:07,275
And that was Napoleon

439
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:12,057
We're not home, but leave your name and
number and we'll call you back soon.

440
00:35:12,928 --> 00:35:15,624
Craig, are you there?
Pick up the phone!

441
00:35:16,668 --> 00:35:18,407
Aw, shit!

442
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:24,233
Listen, I had to borrow your
car. Limo didn't show up.

443
00:35:24,366 --> 00:35:26,540
All hell's breaking loose.

444
00:35:27,802 --> 00:35:30,584
I have two dead bodies in the trunk.

445
00:35:30,715 --> 00:35:37,802
I think I should call the police, but I can't
because one of them, I accidentally killed.

446
00:35:39,456 --> 00:35:45,238
I've been slapped, I've been threatened
by goons, attacked by a freaking' florist.

447
00:35:45,371 --> 00:35:47,893
We haven't even ordered appetizers.

448
00:35:49,675 --> 00:35:51,719
you said something
about old hang-outs.

449
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:56,589
Meet me at a place called Club
Voltaire, if you're not already there.

450
00:35:58,503 --> 00:36:01,112
All right, see you there. Bye.

451
00:36:05,417 --> 00:36:07,809
The flowers were great.
Wonder what's next.

452
00:36:07,939 --> 00:36:10,591
Next?

453
00:36:10,723 --> 00:36:13,462
Uh... it's another surprise.

454
00:36:26,857 --> 00:36:29,553
Hey! Hey, you shit!

455
00:36:29,683 --> 00:36:31,335
Bastard.

456
00:37:21,259 --> 00:37:23,781
Hey. Nah...

457
00:37:33,566 --> 00:37:37,044
Six months ago, I thought
this place was too yuppie.

458
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:22,663
you know what we do with cop killers in this state, flower boy? yeah?
the lucky ones never see the chair!

459
00:38:22,794 --> 00:38:25,533
you don't look lucky to me!

460
00:38:25,664 --> 00:38:29,620
I never saw McHugh until he
stiffed me for the flowers.

461
00:38:29,752 --> 00:38:33,143
And then... he tried
to run me off the road.

462
00:38:33,273 --> 00:38:35,056
- It's the truth!
- Sharpie!

463
00:38:35,188 --> 00:38:37,710
- What?
- I found the kid's boss.

464
00:38:37,841 --> 00:38:41,275
- I guess his story check s out.
- Are you sure?

465
00:38:41,407 --> 00:38:43,972
I got the address where
he made the delivery.

466
00:38:44,102 --> 00:38:46,363
Jesus, poor Al never had a chance.

467
00:38:46,495 --> 00:38:48,582
Let's go get that cop killer.

468
00:38:54,931 --> 00:38:59,757
- Geena, I'm sorry. I thought my brother might...
- This is incredible!

469
00:38:59,888 --> 00:39:02,279
I thought we were gonna get killed.

470
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:04,279
The night is still young.

471
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:10,541
Bottle of your best Champagne.

472
00:39:12,455 --> 00:39:15,760
- Anything else?
- That'll be fine.

473
00:39:20,502 --> 00:39:25,328
A couple of Gourmet Lites, couscous...
a bunch of grapefruit rinds.

474
00:39:25,458 --> 00:39:27,589
Don't these people eat anything?

475
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:33,285
Sir? The search
warrant you asked for.

476
00:39:33,418 --> 00:39:35,157
Good boy.

477
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,635
Victor? Listen to this.

478
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:45,288
- What have you got?
- Listen to this.

479
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:48,594
I have two dead bodies in the trunk.

480
00:39:48,724 --> 00:39:54,637
I should call the police, but I can't
because one of them I accidentally killed.

481
00:39:54,769 --> 00:39:59,247
- If that isn't a confession, what the hell is?
- There's more.

482
00:39:59,378 --> 00:40:01,465
you said something
about old hang-outs.

483
00:40:01,597 --> 00:40:06,727
Club Voltaire, I'm going to a place
called Club Voltaire. Meet me there, OK?

484
00:40:06,858 --> 00:40:08,945
Two dead bodies?

485
00:40:10,206 --> 00:40:13,598
that voice was creepy
Not an ounce of remorse

486
00:40:18,382 --> 00:40:22,165
- Anything else, Mr McHugh?
- No, thanks.

487
00:40:22,296 --> 00:40:24,731
Craig McHugh?

488
00:40:26,602 --> 00:40:29,602
Why? Do I know you? No

489
00:40:29,689 --> 00:40:31,776
but you know my sister.

490
00:40:35,256 --> 00:40:38,604
- I don't even look like my brother.
- Yeah, you do.

491
00:40:38,779 --> 00:40:42,866
you dress like him too. I thought
you stole this credit card.

492
00:40:42,997 --> 00:40:45,867
you know my brother?
Have you seen him?

493
00:40:47,301 --> 00:40:48,954
Upstairs.

494
00:40:49,085 --> 00:40:51,085
Chinese guy.

495
00:40:58,521 --> 00:41:02,129
- Tom?
- Your boyfriend says he'll be right back.

496
00:41:02,261 --> 00:41:04,565
Why? Where did he go?

497
00:41:04,696 --> 00:41:06,609
Upstairs.

498
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:08,479
To find his brother.

499
00:41:10,524 --> 00:41:12,089
Thanks.

500
00:41:18,395 --> 00:41:21,221
Hello? Hello?

501
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:26,048
Craig?

502
00:42:02,621 --> 00:42:06,229
If you'd like to make a
call, please try again.

503
00:42:06,404 --> 00:42:08,361
For help, dial the operator.

504
00:42:26,191 --> 00:42:28,017
McHugh.

505
00:42:32,193 --> 00:42:34,410
Tom?

506
00:42:35,455 --> 00:42:38,281
Tom, is that you?

507
00:42:38,411 --> 00:42:41,585
Uh... uh... no.

508
00:42:41,717 --> 00:42:42,934
Are you OK?

509
00:42:43,064 --> 00:42:45,151
Don't... don't come in!

510
00:42:46,196 --> 00:42:48,500
It's a real mess in here.

511
00:42:48,631 --> 00:42:51,022
- Um...
- What is going on?

512
00:42:51,197 --> 00:42:53,240
I'm coming in, Tom.

513
00:42:53,371 --> 00:42:55,414
No, no! Hold on.

514
00:42:55,545 --> 00:42:57,675
Tom?

515
00:42:59,198 --> 00:43:01,937
What is this place? What's going on?

516
00:43:03,764 --> 00:43:06,851
Are you hungry? Let's
get some Chinese food.

517
00:43:09,723 --> 00:43:12,766
Nervous? I don't think
I'm acting nervous.

518
00:43:12,897 --> 00:43:15,375
you're acting like you have rabies.

519
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:19,724
Why did you disappear like
that? I mean, that's pretty rude.

520
00:43:19,855 --> 00:43:22,029
you're right. you're
right. I'm sorry.

521
00:43:22,159 --> 00:43:27,029
I thought my brother was upstairs,
so I went up there, but he wasn't.

522
00:43:27,161 --> 00:43:30,857
Maybe I want to meet your
brother. He's your hero, right?

523
00:43:30,989 --> 00:43:34,771
- Under the circumstances, that's a bad idea.
- What circumstances, Tom?

524
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:37,728
Circumstances beyond my control.

525
00:43:37,859 --> 00:43:41,207
What does that mean? I don't
understand what that means.

526
00:43:41,946 --> 00:43:46,163
Geena, I know this is
just another night to you,

527
00:43:47,512 --> 00:43:49,991
but it's really
important to me, all right?

528
00:43:53,426 --> 00:43:55,600
Tom, you're a really nice guy...

529
00:43:55,732 --> 00:44:00,210
Nice, nice. Right. I'm afraid
that's my one and only quality.

530
00:44:00,341 --> 00:44:04,037
- That's not true. you have other qualities.
- I do?

531
00:44:04,167 --> 00:44:06,254
Yeah. you're spontaneous.

532
00:44:06,387 --> 00:44:08,430
And you're sincere.

533
00:44:08,561 --> 00:44:12,778
- And you've got great taste.
- That's not me, it's somebody else.

534
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:16,605
I'm just doing that so you won't
ditch me. Besides, you forgot "funny".

535
00:44:16,736 --> 00:44:20,040
I mean, I am funny, right?

536
00:44:22,215 --> 00:44:24,258
Yes, you are funny.

537
00:44:32,305 --> 00:44:34,261
Excuse me?

538
00:44:34,392 --> 00:44:35,914
Is this your vehicle?

539
00:44:38,697 --> 00:44:43,349
Uh, yes. Yes, it is. Is
there a problem, Officer?

540
00:44:44,350 --> 00:44:45,655
Yeah.

541
00:44:45,785 --> 00:44:47,350
you're missing a tyre.

542
00:44:49,438 --> 00:44:52,351
Give me the keys, I'll
help with the spare.

543
00:44:53,396 --> 00:44:55,135
No, no, no!

544
00:44:55,918 --> 00:44:57,700
No, uh...

545
00:44:57,831 --> 00:45:00,570
- Wow.
- you can't leave anything around here.

546
00:45:00,701 --> 00:45:03,092
Uh, well...

547
00:45:04,529 --> 00:45:08,442
Why don't you watch this...?
I'm gonna go get the spare.

548
00:45:10,095 --> 00:45:11,922
These old jack s get wiggly.

549
00:45:34,448 --> 00:45:36,622
That's a leaky flare.

550
00:45:37,666 --> 00:45:40,448
I'll get this one.
you close that trunk.

551
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:05,237
Have a nice night.

552
00:46:10,412 --> 00:46:11,977
Stop!

553
00:46:12,107 --> 00:46:13,847
Come here.

554
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:25,067
I caught you just in
time. Take a look at this.

555
00:46:29,894 --> 00:46:31,938
It's oil, huh?

556
00:46:32,069 --> 00:46:33,373
No.

557
00:46:33,504 --> 00:46:35,330
That ain't oil.

558
00:46:38,548 --> 00:46:41,896
I'd say that was
transmission fluid.

559
00:46:42,027 --> 00:46:46,722
When it gets all red and sticky,
it's time to have it changed.

560
00:46:48,723 --> 00:46:51,549
OK, I'll change it.

561
00:46:55,334 --> 00:46:58,769
- How about some music? Something relaxing?
- Yeah.

562
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:04,075
- Tom, they took your tapes.
- My tapes?

563
00:47:07,902 --> 00:47:10,337
Well, this is relaxing, huh?

564
00:47:10,467 --> 00:47:13,467
Driving in eerie silence.

565
00:47:21,383 --> 00:47:25,470
- What was that? Is that a car phone?
- Uh, no, no.

566
00:47:25,602 --> 00:47:30,167
- It sounds like it's coming from the trunk.
- It's...

567
00:47:30,298 --> 00:47:32,255
It's a trunk car phone.

568
00:47:32,385 --> 00:47:35,385
One of these jobbies
you put in the trunk

569
00:47:35,516 --> 00:47:38,298
then it doesn't bother
you while you're driving.

570
00:47:38,386 --> 00:47:40,299
Don't you think you should answer it?

571
00:47:42,996 --> 00:47:45,170
Yeah, I should.

572
00:47:49,388 --> 00:47:52,475
Craig McHugh was here with a date.

573
00:47:52,649 --> 00:47:56,736
He kills a cop, then goes
out and celebrates? What next?

574
00:47:56,868 --> 00:47:59,346
Sir? There's a dead
Chinese man upstairs.

575
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,391
McHugh was the last
person to see him alive.

576
00:48:03,522 --> 00:48:05,217
This guy is over the edge.

577
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:10,827
He's a psycho. Who would steal from
the head of the Chinese Tong mafia?

578
00:48:36,529 --> 00:48:39,007
There sure aren't many
Chinese people around.

579
00:48:39,137 --> 00:48:41,920
I guess it gets touristy
on Saturday nights.

580
00:48:42,052 --> 00:48:44,878
The Chinese are probably
inside making a living.

581
00:48:45,008 --> 00:48:48,095
Look at this place!
We should go in here.

582
00:48:48,226 --> 00:48:52,705
All right. you go in. I'll ask
someone to recommend where to eat.

583
00:48:52,793 --> 00:48:54,880
- OK.
- All right?

584
00:49:20,233 --> 00:49:22,451
Oh, no, no customer use.

585
00:49:22,582 --> 00:49:24,713
I wanted to see you.

586
00:49:24,843 --> 00:49:29,887
No, no, no, no! you go away.
Go to Happy Moon piano bar.

587
00:49:30,018 --> 00:49:33,235
Find nice boy there.
Nice young man there.

588
00:49:33,367 --> 00:49:35,584
Oh. No, no.

589
00:49:35,715 --> 00:49:40,236
My shirt, my shirt. I need
to know what my shirt says.

590
00:49:40,368 --> 00:49:44,585
Oh... It's backwards.

591
00:49:46,934 --> 00:49:49,021
"Look in pot. "

592
00:49:55,589 --> 00:49:59,676
No, no. "Look in pot" is
an old Chinese proverb.

593
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:01,850
- An old proverb?
- Yeah.

594
00:50:01,982 --> 00:50:06,982
It's about a young man. Very poor.

595
00:50:08,070 --> 00:50:11,983
but he inherits a
pot from his uncle.

596
00:50:12,156 --> 00:50:14,330
Oh, it's very beautiful.

597
00:50:14,463 --> 00:50:19,202
He take pot, he shows it to
neighbour. "Look, look, how beautiful!"

598
00:50:19,333 --> 00:50:23,203
He shines it up, he
puts it up on shelf.

599
00:50:23,333 --> 00:50:25,507
He never look s inside.

600
00:50:26,552 --> 00:50:31,769
See, he never realizes
inside it's full of gold.

601
00:50:33,466 --> 00:50:39,335
So he starved, never
knowing he is so rich.

602
00:50:40,684 --> 00:50:45,554
you'd have thought it would have
jingled around when he moved it.

603
00:50:45,685 --> 00:50:49,816
Proverb! Always look inside a beauty.

604
00:50:49,904 --> 00:50:54,425
Pot is only as good as
what is inside of it.

605
00:50:54,558 --> 00:50:56,514
See?

606
00:50:58,688 --> 00:51:00,558
Thank you.

607
00:51:03,689 --> 00:51:06,776
An adventure is in the air.

608
00:51:06,908 --> 00:51:09,473
Like a wind from a faraway place.

609
00:51:10,299 --> 00:51:15,603
Fortunes made and lost. Men in
the wrong place at the wrong time.

610
00:51:15,736 --> 00:51:21,084
Lives changing... all because
your loins led you out tonight.

611
00:51:22,693 --> 00:51:25,780
It was not my loins.
I was curious.

612
00:51:25,912 --> 00:51:31,433
In women, curiosity is an urge
that springs from the loins.

613
00:51:31,565 --> 00:51:33,608
Oh, but not in men?

614
00:51:33,739 --> 00:51:38,000
In men, everything is an urge
that springs from the loins.

615
00:51:40,219 --> 00:51:44,045
- Geena.
- Ah. Speaking of the devil...

616
00:51:44,175 --> 00:51:49,871
This is the one who needs his fortune
told. Tell me his deepest, darkest secrets.

617
00:51:58,484 --> 00:52:01,310
young man, you are an impostor!

618
00:52:02,832 --> 00:52:04,745
Uh...

619
00:52:04,876 --> 00:52:07,441
Look at the time! We gotta go.

620
00:52:07,572 --> 00:52:10,702
- How munch do we owe you?
- Sit down.

621
00:52:10,835 --> 00:52:13,269
- It's free.
- Take 20. Keep the change.

622
00:52:14,356 --> 00:52:17,052
Beware. Beware of your false self!

623
00:52:29,142 --> 00:52:32,838
Who knows when I would
have found out about you?

624
00:52:32,969 --> 00:52:36,534
Geena, there's something
I've got to tell you.

625
00:52:39,144 --> 00:52:42,666
Mr McHugh, your table is waiting.

626
00:52:46,797 --> 00:52:49,015
We're really not that hungry.

627
00:52:49,146 --> 00:52:52,842
Mr Lew would like you to
be his guests for dinner.

628
00:52:55,451 --> 00:52:57,538
Well, we could eat.

629
00:52:57,670 --> 00:53:02,583
While officials will not call it
a murder spree, two men are dead.

630
00:53:02,714 --> 00:53:05,845
McHugh is believed to be
armed and very dangerous.

631
00:53:07,976 --> 00:53:09,150
Thanks.

632
00:53:10,021 --> 00:53:12,108
Boy, am I starving!

633
00:53:13,194 --> 00:53:15,586
We need to get out of here.

634
00:53:15,717 --> 00:53:17,891
Why? you don't like this place?

635
00:53:19,501 --> 00:53:21,240
A bottle of your best...

636
00:53:22,936 --> 00:53:24,588
...Champagne.

637
00:53:24,675 --> 00:53:28,110
Compliments of Mr Lew.

638
00:53:46,070 --> 00:53:48,157
I'd like to propose a toast.

639
00:53:51,376 --> 00:53:53,420
It's not really a toast, I...

640
00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:57,246
Would you promise me another
chance if I blow it tonight?

641
00:53:58,334 --> 00:54:00,421
you're doing fine.

642
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:07,813
- So how do you know Mr Lew?
- I don't.

643
00:54:07,946 --> 00:54:09,902
This is a misunderstanding.

644
00:54:10,033 --> 00:54:14,989
He knows my brother. And
I don't think he likes him.

645
00:54:15,121 --> 00:54:20,686
And you know how when you don't like
somebody, you don't like their whole family?

646
00:54:23,514 --> 00:54:28,688
What's I'm saying is, I don't think Lew
brought us here to serve us dinner.

647
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:38,907
Your dinner. Compliments of Mr Lew.

648
00:54:41,430 --> 00:54:46,082
It could be dangerous. At the very
least, he won't be a congenial host.

649
00:54:47,693 --> 00:54:50,388
Peking Duck, our house specialty.

650
00:54:51,258 --> 00:54:55,562
If you require anything else
- food, drink...

651
00:54:56,563 --> 00:54:59,650
...additional companions,

652
00:54:59,782 --> 00:55:01,608
anything at all,

653
00:55:01,738 --> 00:55:04,216
please, don't hesitate to ask.

654
00:55:04,391 --> 00:55:06,478
Your money is no good here.

655
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:09,653
Let me put it another way.

656
00:55:10,698 --> 00:55:15,437
I should have said this before,
but I think he wants to kill us.

657
00:55:15,567 --> 00:55:18,219
What, with MSG?

658
00:55:18,351 --> 00:55:23,699
I'm not kidding. I'd feel a lot
better if we just got outta here.

659
00:55:23,830 --> 00:55:27,743
Wait, Tom, you said yourself that
this is just some misunderstanding.

660
00:55:27,918 --> 00:55:31,440
Can't you contact your brother
and ask what's going on?

661
00:55:31,570 --> 00:55:33,875
It's what I've been trying to do.

662
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:36,832
Maybe I should try again.

663
00:55:38,006 --> 00:55:39,963
I'll be right back.

664
00:55:47,792 --> 00:55:51,009
We'll call you back soon.

665
00:55:51,141 --> 00:55:54,488
Craig, are you there?
Pick up the phone.

666
00:55:54,619 --> 00:55:56,271
All right, listen.

667
00:55:56,401 --> 00:56:00,967
I'm at a restaurant
called Chez Lew in Chinatown.

668
00:56:01,098 --> 00:56:03,576
Get here, OK? Now.

669
00:56:03,709 --> 00:56:05,796
All right...

670
00:56:05,926 --> 00:56:08,013
Let's see, maybe he called in.

671
00:56:18,276 --> 00:56:19,319
Strange.

672
00:56:19,450 --> 00:56:22,319
Call Sharpie. Tell him
we've got his location.

673
00:56:24,712 --> 00:56:26,494
McHugh!

674
00:56:29,756 --> 00:56:35,452
I hope you don't mind, I've taken the liberty
of introducing myself to your lovely companion.

675
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:37,583
At last, we meet.

676
00:56:38,628 --> 00:56:41,454
you're... different than I imagined.

677
00:56:41,584 --> 00:56:45,236
Thanks. Lew? Mr Lew?

678
00:56:45,369 --> 00:56:47,456
James Lew.

679
00:56:47,586 --> 00:56:49,847
I hope you're enjoying your meal.

680
00:56:49,979 --> 00:56:52,022
May I join you?

681
00:56:52,153 --> 00:56:54,283
Yeah, sure, sure.

682
00:56:55,501 --> 00:57:00,545
Um... This is a really
great place you have, James.

683
00:57:02,069 --> 00:57:04,156
So...

684
00:57:04,286 --> 00:57:06,938
It seems we share many interests.

685
00:57:07,113 --> 00:57:09,374
Beautiful women, exotic cars,

686
00:57:09,504 --> 00:57:13,243
Manchurian vases of
the late 16th century.

687
00:57:14,897 --> 00:57:19,375
Oh, right. I just saw an
article on your collection.

688
00:57:19,506 --> 00:57:22,159
Ah, you read.

689
00:57:22,289 --> 00:57:26,072
Did you know how valuable
some of those vases can be?

690
00:57:27,638 --> 00:57:32,855
Yeah, actually, it's funny because
just today I heard a proverb about vases.

691
00:57:32,987 --> 00:57:35,030
Actually, it's about a pot.

692
00:57:35,204 --> 00:57:39,030
It's about this poor guy who
gets a pot from his uncle...

693
00:57:39,162 --> 00:57:41,379
I know the proverb.

694
00:57:41,511 --> 00:57:44,598
I don't. What's it about?

695
00:57:44,729 --> 00:57:47,903
It basically says always
look inside the pot.

696
00:57:48,034 --> 00:57:49,991
This is just my interpretation,

697
00:57:50,121 --> 00:57:54,165
but shake it up and see
if there's any money in it.

698
00:57:56,557 --> 00:57:59,644
Oh, so now it's money you're after.

699
00:58:00,689 --> 00:58:04,168
Only yesterday, you were
begging me to spare your life.

700
00:58:07,386 --> 00:58:09,908
And we made a deal, McHugh.

701
00:58:10,952 --> 00:58:12,822
Deal? What's he talking about?

702
00:58:14,561 --> 00:58:20,735
I'm not the guy you made the deal with
I'm not Craig McHugh, he's my brother.

703
00:58:22,519 --> 00:58:25,737
Let me guess. Your
evil twin brother, right?

704
00:58:28,955 --> 00:58:34,694
Where is it? Where is my vase?

705
00:58:36,391 --> 00:58:40,174
Listen, McHugh,

706
00:58:40,349 --> 00:58:42,741
I've been cutting you a lot of slack.

707
00:58:42,871 --> 00:58:49,262
I have not held you accountable for Ho
Wong's "accident" because I like you.

708
00:58:49,394 --> 00:58:53,220
Did you know that he
killed my cousin Ho Wong?

709
00:58:55,221 --> 00:59:00,917
It's our first date. We haven't had
munch time to open up to each other.

710
00:59:01,049 --> 00:59:05,223
He's modest. He told me
it was all in self-defense.

711
00:59:05,354 --> 00:59:08,267
Fine, I understand.

712
00:59:09,138 --> 00:59:13,790
He was probably sent to
kill you. Come to think of it.

713
00:59:15,313 --> 00:59:19,748
but Mr McHugh, enough is enough.

714
00:59:21,444 --> 00:59:25,270
Don't you realise who
you're dealing with here?

715
00:59:26,706 --> 00:59:32,141
Don't you know that you will
never leave this restaurant alive

716
00:59:32,316 --> 00:59:34,620
unless you return my property?

717
00:59:34,751 --> 00:59:36,533
Tell him you're not Craig.

718
00:59:39,405 --> 00:59:42,231
What the heck is your problem?

719
00:59:48,015 --> 00:59:50,493
Hey, hey, everybody,
it's Mr Lew's birthday!

720
00:59:52,537 --> 00:59:56,146
# Happy birthday to you...

721
00:59:56,277 --> 00:59:58,060
It's Mr Lew's birthday!

722
00:59:59,974 --> 01:00:03,974
# Happy birthday to you

723
01:00:04,106 --> 01:00:08,019
# Happy birthday to you

724
01:00:09,715 --> 01:00:12,976
# Happy birthday to you

725
01:00:13,586 --> 01:00:16,238
# Happy birthday to you...

726
01:00:46,114 --> 01:00:50,679
- What are you doing? The police are here.
- The police will arrest me.

727
01:00:50,810 --> 01:00:52,810
Oh, fine.

728
01:00:52,941 --> 01:00:55,723
They'll arrest me because
they think I'm Craig.

729
01:00:56,899 --> 01:00:58,638
I'm wearing Craig's suit.

730
01:00:59,683 --> 01:01:01,422
- His suit?
- Driving his car.

731
01:01:01,552 --> 01:01:06,900
And I'm paying for things with his credit
card, so everybody think s I'm Craig.

732
01:01:07,032 --> 01:01:08,858
Gee, I wonder why.

733
01:01:09,901 --> 01:01:11,727
Look, just stop the car.

734
01:01:13,250 --> 01:01:15,598
Would you stop the car?

735
01:01:17,425 --> 01:01:21,642
We're not going anywhere until you
tell me exactly what's going on.

736
01:01:24,122 --> 01:01:25,687
Where are your witnesses?

737
01:01:25,817 --> 01:01:29,382
McHugh blew in, threw a
party for Lew, then took off.

738
01:01:30,340 --> 01:01:35,557
- I didn't know McHugh was a friend of yours.
- I didn't know you wanted to meet him.

739
01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:38,951
We should all get together
and go bowling some time.

740
01:01:39,081 --> 01:01:43,472
All I know is it's something
to do with this vase of Lew's.

741
01:01:43,604 --> 01:01:45,039
I think Craig might...

742
01:01:46,822 --> 01:01:50,996
- I think he stole it.
- All those cops because of a vase?

743
01:01:51,127 --> 01:01:53,909
I thought he was at
Stanford studying Law!

744
01:01:54,042 --> 01:01:57,824
Now he's here stealing vases,
he's pissing off girls.

745
01:01:57,956 --> 01:02:02,564
God knows what he was thinking
when he set up this stupid date!

746
01:02:02,695 --> 01:02:04,564
Craig set up this date?

747
01:02:05,609 --> 01:02:08,348
Wait a minute. Craig called me?

748
01:02:16,959 --> 01:02:20,220
I expect most guys
to lie about something.

749
01:02:20,350 --> 01:02:23,828
How munch they bench-press, how
many girls they've slept with.

750
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:26,699
What they expect out of
a relationship, but...

751
01:02:27,482 --> 01:02:29,917
but you've created an
alternate parallel universe.

752
01:02:32,396 --> 01:02:33,701
Look...

753
01:02:33,832 --> 01:02:37,571
I wanted to call you the
first time I saw you.

754
01:02:39,485 --> 01:02:43,616
but it was too important to screw
up by saying something stupid.

755
01:02:46,182 --> 01:02:49,356
I just wanted to make a
good first impression.

756
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,835
Tom, that's the idea. To
cut through all of that.

757
01:02:54,923 --> 01:02:57,575
Find out if there's anything
worthwhile on the inside.

758
01:02:57,707 --> 01:02:59,576
Look in the pot.

759
01:03:00,620 --> 01:03:03,185
- What?
- The proverb, remember?

760
01:03:03,316 --> 01:03:06,316
I found it in the loft
above Club Voltaire.

761
01:03:06,447 --> 01:03:08,838
It was a message for my brother.

762
01:03:09,752 --> 01:03:11,448
A message.

763
01:03:13,013 --> 01:03:16,144
Wait, Tom. you know what
that means, don't you?

764
01:03:16,275 --> 01:03:18,318
Yeah, it's a metaphor.

765
01:03:19,406 --> 01:03:23,015
- Beauty is in the inside...
- No, no. It means that

766
01:03:23,146 --> 01:03:26,798
that whatever Lew is after
is inside this vase.

767
01:03:26,929 --> 01:03:29,016
Look in the pot, right?

768
01:03:31,105 --> 01:03:34,236
you're right. I've got to find Craig.

769
01:03:36,322 --> 01:03:38,105
Wait! What is this?

770
01:03:42,323 --> 01:03:44,889
- Still no answer.
- I have an idea.

771
01:03:45,020 --> 01:03:51,368
When I was in Retail, there was a special number we could
use to verify phone numbers of checks. We can get his address this way

772
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:53,109
Yes. Um...

773
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:56,674
5-5-51-8-0-9.
Craig McHugh.

774
01:03:59,110 --> 01:04:03,588
Yeah. 2856 West
Eastwood. Great. Thanks.

775
01:04:04,633 --> 01:04:08,372
So let's go meet your
perfect older brother.

776
01:04:40,727 --> 01:04:45,857
It's McHugh. Tell your boss I've
got his valuable family heirloom.

777
01:04:45,989 --> 01:04:49,641
I stole it back from
the people I sold it to.

778
01:04:49,773 --> 01:04:52,947
It was even easier than
stealing it from you clowns.

779
01:04:53,079 --> 01:04:55,470
I've got an alibi, so no trick s.

780
01:04:59,254 --> 01:05:01,036
Yeah, whatever you say.

781
01:05:01,167 --> 01:05:04,427
I'll make the delivery, just
call off your leg-breakers.

782
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:09,037
you wouldn't want me to get
nervous and drop it, would you?

783
01:05:17,083 --> 01:05:18,474
Hello?

784
01:05:19,474 --> 01:05:21,126
Hello?

785
01:05:21,257 --> 01:05:23,909
What a mess.

786
01:05:24,127 --> 01:05:26,214
- Oh, wow!
- Craig!

787
01:05:26,867 --> 01:05:29,911
Whatever's inside that vase
must be pretty valuable, huh?

788
01:05:30,042 --> 01:05:31,129
Craig?

789
01:05:32,433 --> 01:05:34,868
Oh, gee, think they missed anything?

790
01:05:37,087 --> 01:05:40,913
you can learn a lot about
a person from their garbage.

791
01:05:42,175 --> 01:05:44,348
Yeah, I've heard that.

792
01:05:48,481 --> 01:05:50,568
Here's his phone bill.

793
01:05:53,917 --> 01:05:56,482
He gets his calls
forwarded from California?

794
01:05:58,831 --> 01:06:03,396
Oh, man, I can't believe he's
been here this whole time.

795
01:06:03,527 --> 01:06:05,745
Wait, let's think about this, OK?

796
01:06:06,788 --> 01:06:11,093
Whatever it is, it has to fit
inside a vase... Drugs maybe?

797
01:06:11,224 --> 01:06:13,659
The detective said it was evidence.

798
01:06:13,789 --> 01:06:15,702
What detective?

799
01:06:18,095 --> 01:06:19,225
Uh...

800
01:06:19,355 --> 01:06:22,051
At the gas station, there was...

801
01:06:22,183 --> 01:06:25,356
this detective came to talk to me.

802
01:06:25,488 --> 01:06:27,705
- He thought I was Craig.
- And?

803
01:06:27,837 --> 01:06:32,750
- He stopped thinking I was Craig.
- Tom! Why can't you be straight with me?

804
01:06:32,881 --> 01:06:38,533
All night, it's been, "By the way, we're
looking for Craig and he might be in trouble. "

805
01:06:38,665 --> 01:06:41,317
And, "For dessert,
they're gonna kill us!"

806
01:06:43,405 --> 01:06:46,144
Listen, in the trunk...

807
01:06:50,494 --> 01:06:53,668
...there's the phone...
That was the detective's.

808
01:06:53,798 --> 01:06:56,842
- you stole his phone?
- No, no! He dropped it.

809
01:06:56,973 --> 01:06:59,712
- He dropped it.
- It gets complicated.

810
01:06:59,843 --> 01:07:03,017
- Tom!
- Geena, I can't tell you everything because...

811
01:07:04,061 --> 01:07:06,235
If I did, you'd leave.

812
01:07:07,323 --> 01:07:09,671
Don't bother because
I'm leaving anyway.

813
01:07:11,236 --> 01:07:13,323
Geena... Geena!

814
01:07:21,412 --> 01:07:22,455
What?!

815
01:07:22,586 --> 01:07:24,108
Craig McHugh.

816
01:07:24,197 --> 01:07:27,805
- How good to find you in.
- I'm not Craig McHugh.

817
01:07:28,762 --> 01:07:31,849
No, of course not.
you drive his car,

818
01:07:32,024 --> 01:07:36,328
you answer his phone,
but still, you're not him.

819
01:07:36,459 --> 01:07:38,720
Listen to me, I'm not Craig McHugh!

820
01:07:40,155 --> 01:07:42,590
Nevertheless, it's
good to find you in.

821
01:07:47,506 --> 01:07:49,593
Geena!

822
01:07:53,203 --> 01:07:54,681
Geena!

823
01:07:55,724 --> 01:07:57,811
Geena!

824
01:07:59,421 --> 01:08:01,464
This is a big mistake!

825
01:08:04,595 --> 01:08:06,899
Ahh!

826
01:08:07,031 --> 01:08:08,900
Inside. Move, move!

827
01:08:13,423 --> 01:08:15,032
Now get in the car.

828
01:08:15,162 --> 01:08:17,336
- Stop!
- Get in the car!

829
01:08:23,426 --> 01:08:24,904
Geena!

830
01:08:29,557 --> 01:08:31,253
Tom!

831
01:08:31,383 --> 01:08:33,862
Get up. Get up!

832
01:08:38,602 --> 01:08:41,384
Lew, you don't know
who you're dealing with.

833
01:08:41,517 --> 01:08:46,647
you have until 2am
to return my property.

834
01:08:46,779 --> 01:08:48,474
The pot for the girl.

835
01:08:48,605 --> 01:08:50,692
you know where I live.

836
01:08:52,041 --> 01:08:54,910
Could you just
jog my memory a little?

837
01:08:56,084 --> 01:08:58,954
2am, McHugh.

838
01:08:59,085 --> 01:09:02,824
After that, I can't
guarantee her safety.

839
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:54,879
# I'm cooling' at a bar

840
01:09:55,009 --> 01:09:56,922
# And I'm looking' for some action

841
01:09:57,054 --> 01:10:00,488
# but like Mick Jagger says,
I can't get no satisfaction

842
01:10:00,619 --> 01:10:02,793
# The girls are all around

843
01:10:02,924 --> 01:10:05,098
# but none of them wanna get with me

844
01:10:05,229 --> 01:10:06,837
# My friends are
fresh, I'm looking' def

845
01:10:06,968 --> 01:10:08,707
# Yo, what's up with L.O.C.?

846
01:10:08,838 --> 01:10:11,795
Do exactly what your
big brother says, huh?

847
01:10:11,925 --> 01:10:14,012
"Stick to the plan, Tiger. "

848
01:10:16,665 --> 01:10:18,318
Asshole!

849
01:10:27,494 --> 01:10:29,494
# Funky cold Medina

850
01:10:35,495 --> 01:10:37,582
# Funky cold medhna#

851
01:10:40,541 --> 01:10:43,454
Oh, you dick!

852
01:10:43,585 --> 01:10:47,064
- What the hell was that?
- What the hell was what?

853
01:10:49,326 --> 01:10:51,412
There's somebody in there.

854
01:10:54,674 --> 01:10:56,413
Want me to tell Sharpie?

855
01:10:56,544 --> 01:11:00,413
Yeah. Tell him we've got McHugh.

856
01:11:04,936 --> 01:11:06,328
Oh, man.

857
01:11:37,031 --> 01:11:39,640
Craig, I need that vase now!

858
01:11:41,771 --> 01:11:44,597
Shunt up!

859
01:11:46,251 --> 01:11:48,164
I said, "Shunt up!"

860
01:12:05,297 --> 01:12:07,384
Craig!

861
01:12:30,128 --> 01:12:31,911
They took the tapes.

862
01:12:36,348 --> 01:12:41,869
They weren't after the vase. They
were after what was inside the vase.

863
01:12:42,001 --> 01:12:44,088
What was inside the vase...

864
01:12:48,741 --> 01:12:50,828
...was a tape.

865
01:12:57,004 --> 01:13:00,960
Look, Condon, I didn't complain when
you upped your price for protection.

866
01:13:01,134 --> 01:13:04,743
I gave you a bonus when
you took care of Scheski.

867
01:13:04,874 --> 01:13:06,918
Why are my people getting busted?

868
01:13:07,092 --> 01:13:09,526
This anti-drug thing
is getting outta hand.

869
01:13:09,658 --> 01:13:13,136
you gotta show results, Lew.
you want the FBI nosing around?

870
01:13:16,486 --> 01:13:19,008
Condon the detective.

871
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:47,188
All right, McHugh, we
know you're in there.

872
01:13:47,796 --> 01:13:50,188
He's not in there.

873
01:13:55,668 --> 01:13:59,798
Listen up. Wilkins, Jesse!
you guys cover Sleepy Hollow.

874
01:13:59,929 --> 01:14:02,450
Carver, Mitchell, Babbling Brook Way.

875
01:14:02,582 --> 01:14:05,365
Hotchins, Romano, Bonny Meadow Lane!

876
01:14:05,495 --> 01:14:08,365
Simpson, Lazy Bunny Hutch!

877
01:14:08,496 --> 01:14:11,539
Don't take chances.
This is a war zone!

878
01:14:47,070 --> 01:14:49,418
# I'm on my way

879
01:14:50,940 --> 01:14:52,853
# I'm on my way

880
01:14:54,071 --> 01:14:57,202
# Your lust hs getting hotter

881
01:15:01,072 --> 01:15:03,681
Oh, damn it!

882
01:15:14,293 --> 01:15:15,814
"James Wo Chong Lew. "

883
01:15:34,776 --> 01:15:38,950
What a day! Your boyfriend
has caused me no end of grief.

884
01:15:39,081 --> 01:15:41,168
He's not my boyfriend.

885
01:15:41,299 --> 01:15:44,212
So there is a limit
to McHugh's charm.

886
01:15:45,126 --> 01:15:48,082
Ben, Jerry, go get some ice cream.

887
01:15:48,213 --> 01:15:51,256
Would you like anything?
Food? Something to drink?

888
01:15:52,301 --> 01:15:56,040
This is kidnapping. you
could get in a lot of trouble.

889
01:15:56,910 --> 01:15:59,302
I don't want to talk business.

890
01:15:59,432 --> 01:16:01,823
I am tired of business.

891
01:16:06,737 --> 01:16:08,824
Let's try to relax.

892
01:16:09,870 --> 01:16:12,131
I can't relax. I'm a prisoner.

893
01:16:13,478 --> 01:16:15,565
Sure you can.

894
01:16:21,002 --> 01:16:23,089
you just need a little help.

895
01:16:32,831 --> 01:16:36,744
Help me! Help!

896
01:16:36,875 --> 01:16:39,962
- Oh.
- Help me.

897
01:16:40,093 --> 01:16:41,224
Hi, Craig.

898
01:16:41,354 --> 01:16:45,658
- Help me!
- Help you? I could help you.

899
01:16:46,703 --> 01:16:49,051
On the other hand, if I don't,

900
01:16:49,182 --> 01:16:55,791
all your friends, family and neighbours will
call up and order flowers for your funeral.

901
01:16:55,922 --> 01:16:58,574
And I can make a lot of money!

902
01:16:58,705 --> 01:17:01,705
I can make a lot of money on tips...

903
01:17:05,489 --> 01:17:09,011
if I still had my job!

904
01:17:11,273 --> 01:17:14,490
you stiffed me for my tip.

905
01:17:16,535 --> 01:17:18,752
Fine, that's OK.

906
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:26,492
you try to run me off
the road... no problem!

907
01:17:30,322 --> 01:17:32,365
I'm a flower boy!

908
01:17:36,496 --> 01:17:38,757
It all comes with the territory.

909
01:17:41,802 --> 01:17:43,758
What's your problem?

910
01:17:43,889 --> 01:17:47,150
What's that? Did you say something?

911
01:17:47,281 --> 01:17:48,542
I can't hear you.

912
01:17:48,672 --> 01:17:51,281
Take that thing out of your mouth.

913
01:17:51,412 --> 01:17:53,064
What's your problem?

914
01:17:53,239 --> 01:17:57,369
you're my problem. you're
my problem! you're my...

915
01:18:16,025 --> 01:18:18,112
No problem, no problem.

916
01:18:25,767 --> 01:18:28,637
No problem, man. I'm fine.

917
01:18:29,681 --> 01:18:31,377
I'm all right.

918
01:19:24,605 --> 01:19:28,432
- What are you gonna do about it?
- I want a divorce!

919
01:19:34,347 --> 01:19:37,955
Hi. I've got a flower
delivery for Mr Lew.

920
01:19:38,130 --> 01:19:40,565
Flowers at two in the morning?

921
01:19:40,695 --> 01:19:43,521
Yeah, no kidding. It's
some kind of emergency.

922
01:19:43,652 --> 01:19:45,521
Emergency flowers?

923
01:19:46,566 --> 01:19:49,392
Uh... hey, don't ask me, OK?

924
01:19:49,522 --> 01:19:52,392
I think he wants to
impress some girl.

925
01:19:53,871 --> 01:19:57,002
OK, right, right.

926
01:19:58,046 --> 01:20:00,438
The girl, yeah.

927
01:20:01,787 --> 01:20:04,353
Better get on up there then.

928
01:20:05,831 --> 01:20:07,309
OK.

929
01:20:07,441 --> 01:20:09,614
Thank you.

930
01:20:14,268 --> 01:20:17,485
- Chalk one up for the good guys.
- Find the body?

931
01:20:17,615 --> 01:20:20,702
Not yet. but the engineer
swears he hit him.

932
01:20:20,878 --> 01:20:22,922
He found this on the track s.

933
01:20:25,879 --> 01:20:31,531
- Kill a cop, kiss a train. Seems about right.
- Mr Sharpsteen? Be so kind?

934
01:20:31,663 --> 01:20:34,054
Let's see what
Forensics has to say.

935
01:20:36,490 --> 01:20:41,142
- What have you got, Katz?
- Strange ruminations from the trunk.

936
01:20:41,273 --> 01:20:44,142
The Chinese gentleman was one Ho Wong.

937
01:20:44,274 --> 01:20:46,578
A hit man for James Lew.

938
01:20:46,708 --> 01:20:51,100
He was waiting in the trunk to kill
McHugh. Fired a single round...

939
01:20:52,753 --> 01:20:55,796
through the trunk lid here.

940
01:20:56,841 --> 01:20:59,841
Mistakenly felling peace
officer Albert Condon.

941
01:20:59,973 --> 01:21:02,408
Wait a minute, that's got to be wrong.

942
01:21:02,538 --> 01:21:04,191
McHugh killed Al.

943
01:21:04,321 --> 01:21:06,147
Not so, my friend.

944
01:21:07,192 --> 01:21:10,539
Ho Wong is our man.
He killed Officer Condon.

945
01:21:10,670 --> 01:21:15,148
Judging by the leak in the exhaust,
I'd say Wong died of asphyxiation.

946
01:21:15,975 --> 01:21:18,280
No, McHugh was no killer.

947
01:21:36,589 --> 01:21:38,154
Hai! Hai!

948
01:21:42,242 --> 01:21:44,460
2.30.

949
01:21:44,590 --> 01:21:47,025
I'd say you were being stood up.

950
01:21:51,461 --> 01:21:53,765
Come on.

951
01:22:19,641 --> 01:22:22,902
you wouldn't want them
to come and find me dead.

952
01:22:24,469 --> 01:22:28,860
I don't think you realise how
many friends I have in the police.

953
01:22:28,991 --> 01:22:31,556
Please, sit down.

954
01:22:57,258 --> 01:22:59,128
Hai!

955
01:22:59,258 --> 01:23:03,867
Lew, if you do anything to me, you'll
never get that evidence you're after.

956
01:23:06,477 --> 01:23:10,955
Evidence? What evidence
are you talking about?

957
01:23:11,043 --> 01:23:14,956
Oh, I know all about it.
The evidence in the pot.

958
01:23:18,132 --> 01:23:20,175
So McHugh did tell you.

959
01:23:24,567 --> 01:23:26,654
That's too bad.

960
01:23:27,742 --> 01:23:30,438
Yours will be an
honorable death, McHugh.

961
01:23:30,568 --> 01:23:34,308
Hai! This sword has been in
my family for three centuries.

962
01:23:38,701 --> 01:23:41,092
you asshole.

963
01:23:41,831 --> 01:23:45,570
Honor? Shit! I'll kill
you with my bare hands.

964
01:23:47,398 --> 01:23:50,398
Ah, Happy Birthday,

965
01:23:50,529 --> 01:23:52,225
McHugh.

966
01:24:03,141 --> 01:24:04,880
What the h...?

967
01:24:13,883 --> 01:24:15,752
- Geena!
- Are you all right?

968
01:24:15,883 --> 01:24:17,839
- I'm fine.
- Good.

969
01:24:17,971 --> 01:24:20,188
Damn it, Tom! Or is it Craig?

970
01:24:20,319 --> 01:24:22,406
No, it's Tom.

971
01:24:25,494 --> 01:24:29,276
- You promised me another chance if I blew it.
- You blew it.

972
01:24:32,364 --> 01:24:34,408
Come on!

973
01:24:35,496 --> 01:24:37,539
Hands up, McHugh.

974
01:24:39,843 --> 01:24:41,930
Hand over the tape, Craig.

975
01:24:42,062 --> 01:24:46,149
- Don't. Once he has the tape, he'll kill us.
- I'll kill you anyway!

976
01:24:49,498 --> 01:24:53,541
Do what you want with the window,
just leave the girl alone.

977
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:59,108
Lew, move and I drop your
precious pot. Lose the gun.

978
01:24:59,240 --> 01:25:01,587
Go ahead!

979
01:25:02,892 --> 01:25:05,979
Your boyfriend stole
everything that was valuable.

980
01:25:06,067 --> 01:25:09,458
He had a fence to tell
him which ones to take.

981
01:25:11,330 --> 01:25:13,417
Check the rest of the grounds.

982
01:25:15,852 --> 01:25:17,722
Give me the tape.

983
01:25:19,418 --> 01:25:21,461
Give me the tape!

984
01:25:33,812 --> 01:25:35,681
Uh-uh-uh.

985
01:25:35,812 --> 01:25:39,421
- I don't think so.
- Now who the heck are you?

986
01:25:39,552 --> 01:25:41,204
I'm Craig McHugh.

987
01:25:41,335 --> 01:25:44,813
Stop picking on my brother,
or I drop your heirloom.

988
01:25:44,944 --> 01:25:46,901
We tried that already.

989
01:25:47,031 --> 01:25:50,118
- Please.
- Craig, he doesn't want the vase.

990
01:25:50,250 --> 01:25:52,771
- Tom...
- Craig, he doesn't want the vase!

991
01:25:52,946 --> 01:25:55,816
Tom, I know a little more than you.

992
01:25:55,946 --> 01:25:59,512
I set you up as my
alibi... which you fowled up!

993
01:26:02,383 --> 01:26:05,905
- you don't want the vase?
- I have what I want.

994
01:26:06,861 --> 01:26:10,253
If you'll excuse me,
I have to call the police.

995
01:26:10,429 --> 01:26:14,124
A thief and his accomplices were
found shot here in self-defense.

996
01:26:14,299 --> 01:26:16,864
- I made copies of that tape.
- What tape?

997
01:26:16,995 --> 01:26:18,603
- you're bluffing.
- I did.

998
01:26:18,734 --> 01:26:21,864
I can prove it. Give me the phone.

999
01:26:23,344 --> 01:26:25,257
15 seconds.

1000
01:26:25,387 --> 01:26:27,126
No funny stuff, McHugh.

1001
01:26:41,347 --> 01:26:43,303
- Hi, I'm Richard.
- I'm Betty.

1002
01:26:43,435 --> 01:26:46,522
And that was Napoleon.
We're not home...

1003
01:26:50,263 --> 01:26:54,567
Look, Condon, I didn't complain when
you upped your price for protection.

1004
01:26:54,697 --> 01:26:57,958
I gave you a bonus when
you took care of Scheski.

1005
01:26:58,133 --> 01:27:00,133
Why are my people getting busted?

1006
01:27:00,264 --> 01:27:02,394
This anti-drug thing
is getting outta hand.

1007
01:27:02,569 --> 01:27:06,004
We gotta show results. you
want the FBI nosing around?

1008
01:27:06,134 --> 01:27:07,221
Condon.

1009
01:27:07,353 --> 01:27:13,309
Lie low for a few months, then we'll talk
to Sharpie and Doheny and cut a new deal.

1010
01:27:13,398 --> 01:27:17,789
Like I said, if the FBI gets
wind of this, we're all screwed.

1011
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:22,355
Unbelievable. They're all in on it.

1012
01:27:24,574 --> 01:27:26,965
Don't like that copy? I made more.

1013
01:27:27,096 --> 01:27:33,313
If we don't return safely, I've left
instructions for the tapes to be sent to the FBI.

1014
01:27:34,749 --> 01:27:36,618
No Wa t, wa t, wa t, wa t

1015
01:27:39,576 --> 01:27:42,750
- Great, the police.
- Great, the police.

1016
01:27:47,143 --> 01:27:49,100
Nobody move, nobody gets hurt.

1017
01:27:49,231 --> 01:27:53,449
I'm glad you're here. He was
gonna kill us in cold blood.

1018
01:27:53,580 --> 01:27:54,971
Is that right?

1019
01:27:55,102 --> 01:27:59,406
- We've got evidence that'll put him away for life.
- you found the tape?

1020
01:27:59,538 --> 01:28:02,364
He's got it, but I
have a copy at home.

1021
01:28:02,494 --> 01:28:04,668
Only two? So you were bluffing.

1022
01:28:04,799 --> 01:28:08,234
Kill him. Finish him off
for me! Earn your payoff.

1023
01:28:08,366 --> 01:28:11,583
- you're the payoff cops?
- The payoff cops?

1024
01:28:11,714 --> 01:28:14,149
- This isn't fair.
- Shunt up!

1025
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:18,410
- Who is this guy?
- It's McHugh, you idiot. Kill him!

1026
01:28:18,542 --> 01:28:22,455
- I'm not Craig McHugh!
- He's not Craig McHugh, I am.

1027
01:28:22,586 --> 01:28:25,629
- Positive, he's not Craig McHugh.
- Kill 'em both.

1028
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:28,890
And the girl. One of
them must be McHugh.

1029
01:28:29,022 --> 01:28:31,109
McHugh's already dead.

1030
01:28:31,239 --> 01:28:34,065
In fact, he died a hero.

1031
01:28:34,197 --> 01:28:36,284
One of your pals killed Al.

1032
01:28:36,414 --> 01:28:39,718
Then McHugh killed him.

1033
01:28:39,850 --> 01:28:43,285
Then you, you killed McHugh.

1034
01:28:44,024 --> 01:28:47,154
And now, Lew, I'm gonna kill you.

1035
01:28:47,287 --> 01:28:49,852
- Kill me?
- That's what I said!

1036
01:28:50,026 --> 01:28:53,678
you kill for me. I say
who kills who. Kill them.

1037
01:28:53,809 --> 01:28:56,201
And while you're at
it, kill yourself.

1038
01:28:59,636 --> 01:29:01,810
They're getting away!

1039
01:29:06,552 --> 01:29:08,160
Freeze!

1040
01:29:13,031 --> 01:29:15,205
Nobody move

1041
01:29:15,336 --> 01:29:18,249
- Drop your weapons. you're under arrest.
- For what?

1042
01:29:18,380 --> 01:29:22,293
Bribery, extortion...

1043
01:29:23,424 --> 01:29:26,337
...and extreme stupidity.

1044
01:29:42,297 --> 01:29:44,036
Hey, why so glum?

1045
01:29:44,125 --> 01:29:47,560
you could thank me for
coming to your rescue.

1046
01:29:47,690 --> 01:29:50,429
Thanks, Craig. Thank
s for everything.

1047
01:29:54,256 --> 01:29:57,343
- What the hell's your problem, Tommy?
- What's my problem?

1048
01:29:57,475 --> 01:30:03,214
I spent my life being compared to my perfect
older brother and you don't even exist.

1049
01:30:03,346 --> 01:30:08,303
you're a lying, thieving, sociopathic
criminal. And I thought you were a lawyer.

1050
01:30:09,738 --> 01:30:11,869
Now we're splitting hairs, aren't we?

1051
01:30:13,783 --> 01:30:17,348
Get outta here. Take your S200
shoes, your stupid shirt.

1052
01:30:17,479 --> 01:30:23,131
I don't want anyone else to mistake me
for the legendary asshole Craig McHugh.

1053
01:30:23,262 --> 01:30:25,262
- you're an ingrate.
- Ingrate?

1054
01:30:25,394 --> 01:30:27,654
you almost got us killed.

1055
01:30:27,785 --> 01:30:30,741
I'm sorry. I guess I screwed up.

1056
01:30:30,873 --> 01:30:34,308
I put a little adventure
into your lives, that's it.

1057
01:30:34,438 --> 01:30:38,438
Go on, go back to your
safe, suburban homes.

1058
01:30:38,570 --> 01:30:42,265
And lock your doors
and watch your MTV.

1059
01:30:43,050 --> 01:30:45,485
but I'll tell you this munch,

1060
01:30:45,615 --> 01:30:49,702
when you're old, sitting on your
wrinkled asses, there'll be one night,

1061
01:30:49,833 --> 01:30:54,920
one date out of your whole boring lives
that you'll remember and it'll be tonight.

1062
01:30:56,921 --> 01:30:58,747
Oh, Tommy?

1063
01:30:58,878 --> 01:31:01,269
Don't tell Mom and Dad, all right?

1064
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:32,623
I... want my tip,

1065
01:31:32,754 --> 01:31:34,667
Craig.

1066
01:31:34,799 --> 01:31:36,538
Hey, no problem...

1067
01:31:38,929 --> 01:31:39,929
...Dwight.

1068
01:32:58,339 --> 01:33:00,904
you're very strange, you know.

1069
01:33:03,253 --> 01:33:05,905
I still don't know a thing about you.

1070
01:33:11,297 --> 01:33:13,080
Good night.

1071
01:33:47,391 --> 01:33:51,304
I have some questions
before I say good night.

1072
01:33:58,742 --> 01:34:00,525

1080
01:34:17,963 --> 01:34:20,833
And that was Napoleon.

1081
01:34:21,007 --> 01:34:26,702
We're not home, but leave your name and
number and we'll call you back soon.

1082
01:34:26,877 --> 01:34:31,877
- Tom? Napoleon won! He's champion.
- Best dog in the show.

1083
01:34:32,009 --> 01:34:34,531
We'll celebrate when we get back.

1084
01:34:34,662 --> 01:34:39,227
Maybe let you have a beer
Napoleon wants too talk to you

1085
01:34:39,359 --> 01:34:41,402
Here, boy.

1086
01:34:41,925 --> 01:34:45,577
# You're so fine lose my mind

1087
01:34:45,707 --> 01:34:48,794
# And the world seems to disappear

1088
01:34:49,665 --> 01:34:53,013
# All the problems all the fears

1089
01:34:53,450 --> 01:34:56,319
