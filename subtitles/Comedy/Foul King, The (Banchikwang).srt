1
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:08,110
(Episode 26)

2
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,889
His Majesty just left
for Mount Dora.

3
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,889
Are you saying
he went hunting again?

4
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,030
Yes.

5
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,430
In that case,
bring me the key to Naebanggo.

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,229
Since he is away,
I will take care of it.

7
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:36,540
Well, it looks like
he took the key with him.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,770
I asked the man who keeps the key,

9
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,810
and he said he never got it back
after he gave it to him yesterday.

10
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,820
I will go to the hunting ground.

11
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,389
I will get that key
no matter what.

12
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,459
Do not go.
I am sure that woman is with him.

13
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:04,799
You do not need to see that.

14
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,069
The soldiers will be shaken.

15
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:08,400
Do not worry.

16
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,870
I am looking for another way around.

17
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,410
What is that?

18
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,680
Eun San had it on her.

19
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,319
She must have wished to
use that to bargain for...

20
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,590
her father's release
for hiding her identity.

21
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,459
Is this a list of
her father's assets?

22
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:33,790
- Crown Prince.
- It seems like...

23
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,730
- we can borrow some supplies.
- Your bride.

24
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,200
She needs my final approval.

25
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,370
Even if you choose whom you want,

26
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,840
you cannot marry her
if I do not approve.

27
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:50,009
What are you thinking?

28
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,680
Your bride's background
and character are all important,

29
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,450
but more than anything,

30
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:57,950
we must consider how
she can be of assistance to you.

31
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:02,790
I will not harm your reputation.

32
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,820
We just need to find...

33
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,490
one very small flaw.

34
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,100
She is here.

35
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:17,560
Your Highness, I am Eun San.

36
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,570
My master sent me
to help in any way I can.

37
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:29,110
Master Lin, we meet again.

38
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,249
My master recommends these people.

39
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,649
They are well-learned...

40
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,019
but were ignored because
they lacked connections.

41
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,249
They can help if placed in
relevant offices.

42
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,660
Why are you dressed like that?

43
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,659
Are those your master's clothes?

44
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,429
He also said you should guard...

45
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,859
the warehouses in which
you store your men's wages.

46
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,200
That is too late.

47
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,200
If it is too late for that,

48
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,600
he said to give you this.

49
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,940
- What is it?
- 1,000 sacks of grain and...

50
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,570
200 blocks of silver.

51
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:02,939
This is what?

52
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,179
Grain we received as rent
from our fields in Gimje...

53
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,850
and stalls in Namdaega...

54
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,180
Forget it.

55
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,020
- My father sent...
- I am the Crown Prince.

56
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,219
- I may be in need, but...
- Your Highness.

57
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,320
What?

58
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,490
You need to accept that.

59
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,759
I have a request.

60
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,300
Okay. I will grant it.

61
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,699
I have not yet told you what it is.

62
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,370
Tell me, and I will grant it.

63
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:36,610
You said you would find
who killed my mother.

64
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,710
I did.

65
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:43,020
Take that back.

66
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,880
I should not find him?

67
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,020
Yes.

68
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,059
You are asking me...

69
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,960
not to do something.

70
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,860
Yes.

71
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,530
You will give up?

72
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:57,799
Why are you interrupting?

73
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,500
You forgot everything else
to chase the tattooed man.

74
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,640
Can you give up?

75
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,840
It is my father's plea.

76
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,769
Very well. I will not find him.

77
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,380
Lin, keep quiet.

78
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,210
I just granted her wish.

79
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,549
- How are you?
- You are so pretty.

80
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:54,189
You have not visited
in such a long time.

81
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,989
I came to see you.

82
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,490
I missed you so much.

83
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:01,759
I know, I know.

84
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,200
I am here now.

85
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,149
I knew it.

86
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,659
Why are you here?

87
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,019
I followed you.

88
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,130
Since when?

89
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,959
- Come with me.
- Where to?

90
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,630
There is someone you must meet.

91
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:14,400
- Who is it?
- Will you just...

92
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,410
Come with me.

93
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,259
Just when...

94
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,659
I am about to forget
about it, you ask me again.

95
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,929
And then again.

96
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,190
Tell this lady...

97
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,529
exactly what you told me.

98
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:45,829
Why must I...

99
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:49,339
when I am not at all
proud of what I did?

100
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,500
Exactly.

101
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,510
Immediately.

102
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,009
Yeom Bok, you tell it this time.

103
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:56,979
No, I do not want to.

104
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:00,810
Whenever I talk about that,
I have bad dreams for days.

105
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:03,119
I see the people who died.

106
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,519
Are you a psychic
to see dead people?

107
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,789
- I should just...
- Were you both at Sungjukjae?

108
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,219
That day,

109
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:12,219
we were there with the bandits.

110
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,889
We were not bandits ourselves.

111
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:16,260
It is quite interesting.

112
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,000
You are...

113
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,540
the young child who was
there that day, right?

114
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,099
- Did you see me?
- Yes.

115
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,409
There were two young girls.

116
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:28,569
Right, Yeom Bok?

117
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:30,609
- I do not know.
- That day,

118
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,209
a man in black flew around...

119
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:35,109
killing all the bodyguards.

120
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:38,980
He looked like
a sword-wielding devil.

121
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:41,690
What else did you see?

122
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:45,520
One of the girls got hurt.

123
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,790
And then...

124
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,200
Those men came.

125
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,730
My older brother.

126
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,599
This master's brother was shocked...

127
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,269
when he saw the girl was hurt,

128
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,639
and he ran over.

129
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,080
And that girl was you?

130
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,710
- You left something out.
- Left out?

131
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,880
What is that?

132
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,419
My lady.

133
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,159
I know that face.

134
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,190
The Chancellor's second son.

135
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,070
There was...

136
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:29,600
nothing else.

137
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,999
That is not what you said before.

138
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,110
Before?

139
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,079
What did I say?

140
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,680
The assassin and my brother...

141
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:41,380
recognized each other.

142
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,450
They made eye contact.

143
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,589
They did not.

144
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:50,719
- What?
- You must have misheard me.

145
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,560
I never said that.

146
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:54,659
Tell the truth.

147
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,129
You tried to hit me then too.

148
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,329
You screamed.

149
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:01,529
That is why I just said
whatever came to my mind first.

150
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:04,000
Am I not right, Yeom Bok?

151
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,879
I did as you said.

152
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,749
They are great liars.

153
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,720
Master Lin fell for it.

154
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,660
Well done.

155
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:28,090
The salt merchant.

156
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:30,660
Jin Gwan went to
tell him what to say.

157
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,930
Will Master Lin go to him as well?

158
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,170
He will.

159
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,500
He is stubborn and
will do all he can.

160
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,610
- Why...
- What?

161
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,210
Why are you doing this?

162
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,839
I do not understand.

163
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,980
Me neither.

164
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,810
I do not understand myself.

165
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,089
His Highness apprehended
someone else.

166
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,789
A salt merchant.

167
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:58,260
He worked as Song In's messenger.

168
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,560
The Crown Prince...

169
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,860
made him a double agent.

170
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,570
Come with me.

171
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:21,880
That is him.

172
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:28,750
He said Song In
and my brother met often.

173
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:30,120
And...

174
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:34,160
he saw a man with a snake tattoo.

175
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,230
I will bring him over.

176
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,200
Ask him whatever you want.

177
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:51,080
What are you doing?

178
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,409
Helping you.

179
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:55,780
I am looking for the man who...

180
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,520
killed my mother eight years ago.

181
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,320
I know.

182
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,450
Do you know...

183
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,420
why I refused
the Crown Prince's help?

184
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,360
Why did you?

185
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,630
The men I am after...

186
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,969
are connected to your brother.

187
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:18,170
You could get involved.

188
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,839
Are you concerned for me?

189
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:23,109
They are cunning.
They even deceived the King.

190
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,180
And you will...

191
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,480
take them on alone?

192
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,479
I have a plan.

193
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,650
What is it?

194
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,490
You need not know.

195
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:36,790
This is a private matter,
so let me take care of it.

196
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,330
You must know...

197
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:47,600
why they did it.

198
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,140
You cannot give up.

199
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,310
I must know...

200
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,210
and end it...

201
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,750
to start over.

202
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,250
Only then...

203
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:10,090
can I stop feeling guilty...

204
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:15,230
and enjoy good food
and good company.

205
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,130
And get on with my life.

206
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,890
They stayed together all night?

207
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,759
Whom did they meet
and what did they discuss about?

208
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,700
I could not get
close enough to hear.

209
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,200
They are both competent fighters.

210
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:55,700
The Chancellor's third son...

211
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,070
and Lord Eun's daughter.

212
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,110
And...

213
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,350
Now, I get it.

214
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,250
The Crown Prince's weakness.

215
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:22,129
I shall see what I can do.

216
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:24,629
Try to keep this from the soldiers.

217
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,030
Wang Lin was always at his side.

218
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:30,070
The Crown Prince's
most trustworthy companion.

219
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:33,740
To separate him
from the Crown Prince...

220
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,810
That should be fun.

221
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:42,050
Even more so than discussing
Goryeo's future with some fools.

222
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,730
I am glad to meet you.

223
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,829
I will be asking you
for a lot of things.

224
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:06,140
They were so close that
I never dared to split them apart.

225
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,940
Now, I see a way how.

226
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:18,119
How dare you hold a blade to her?

227
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,620
I had always known the Crown Prince
had feelings for her, but...

228
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,119
Master Lin too?

229
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,529
What will you do about Master Jeon?

230
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:27,730
Right.

231
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:29,560
Wang Jeon.

232
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:35,530
He gets more anxious each day.

233
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,170
He visits every day
to ask for a plan.

234
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,110
What should I do?

235
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:43,510
Leave the older
and take the younger?

236
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:44,840
Which will make...

237
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,780
a king who will serve me better?

238
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,820
Master Lin is very loyal.

239
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,680
Will he side with you?

240
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,450
When he has
no one else to turn to,

241
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,920
he will have to.

242
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,960
You told me to...

243
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:34,459
find out if the Chancellor's
family had any flaws.

244
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,460
The Crown Prince's bride's family...

245
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,200
can have no flaws
that can become weaknesses.

246
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:43,540
I heard of a strange rumor.

247
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,700
A rumor is not enough.

248
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:48,510
What if there is
a witness and evidence?

249
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,380
Will you hear it?

250
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:55,210
I always knew you were talented.

251
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,620
Thank you, Your Highness.

252
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,160
What about Kim Do Kyung?

253
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:08,930
He received land every 2 or 3 years.

254
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,830
I saw the tax records somewhere.

255
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,700
Third book on the pile to your left.

256
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,110
Do you remember all this?

257
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,140
Ink.

258
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:24,740
What?

259
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,810
The ink is dripping.

260
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,980
- My goodness.
- Oh no.

261
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,050
- Oh no.
- Wipe it.

262
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:35,650
Okay.

263
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:50,500
I am not usually like this.

264
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,700
Okay.

265
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:54,240
I did not sleep much last night.

266
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:56,040
We shall say so.

267
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:05,180
Where are you going?

268
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:09,260
When a lady leaves on her own,
do not ask where she is going.

269
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,499
Where are you going?

270
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,869
Just... Outside.

271
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:23,369
If you are going home,
I shall walk you.

272
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:25,869
I am not going home.
We are not done yet.

273
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:27,110
Are you sure?

274
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,939
I want to get some air.
I have a headache.

275
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,509
We shall go. I will walk you out.

276
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,479
No, thanks. I will be fine.

277
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,579
You will not be.

278
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,420
Lin, come here.

279
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,750
Do you know what she did last night?

280
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,449
She went alone...

281
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:45,090
The lady needs to be alone.

282
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:59,269
She went to Song In's home.

283
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:01,740
What if she met
the man with the tattoo?

284
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:05,380
I fought him once,
and he was a better fighter.

285
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,279
She has a temper.

286
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,980
- If she were to see him...
- I sent a bodyguard after her.

287
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,750
I will protect her.

288
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,490
I overstepped my boundaries.

289
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:31,699
The Queen sent me.

290
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,009
For what?

291
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:35,170
To get Master Lin.

292
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,310
You are to come alone.

293
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,240
Is it to Wonseongjeon?

294
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,870
To the interrogation hall.

295
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,010
I am here at your service.

296
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,990
Repeat what you said earlier.

297
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,160
Word for word.

298
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,460
Eight years ago,

299
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:08,300
I led a group of ruffians.

300
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,570
One day, someone came to us.

301
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:14,410
They told me to try robbing someone.

302
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,110
Will you come with us?

303
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,979
They said the more, the better.

304
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,149
- Where are you going?
- To rob someone.

305
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,519
Why do you need a whole army
to rob someone?

306
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,989
We are going to rob
Eun Young Baek's merchants.

307
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:33,760
They wanted to rob
the Minister of Finance's merchants.

308
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:39,170
So I gathered about 20 men.

309
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:42,470
I gathered them myself.

310
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,940
They trusted me when they got
into this, but all of them died.

311
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:48,810
I almost died myself.

312
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:51,510
I barely made it alive.

313
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:55,820
I mean, if you can
really call this living.

314
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,270
They blamed the murder on us.

315
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:15,899
They wanted to make it look like
robbers came to get their things.

316
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,839
They only used us.

317
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,540
Did you say you saw the one
who ordered this to happen?

318
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,610
I did.

319
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,450
Is this his?

320
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:30,250
He said he would pay us
after the work was done,

321
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:33,390
so I asked him for a security.

322
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:37,990
He took that off of his belt
and gave it to me.

323
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:41,730
Lin.

324
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,060
Yes, Your Highness.

325
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:48,930
Do you recognize this?

326
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,270
It looks like the butterfly symbol
of your family.

327
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,470
- What do you think?
- They were going to kill us all.

328
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:28,569
And they killed
every single one of us.

329
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:31,739
They even killed those who tried
to escape after they were hit.

330
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,879
They cut down our men
over and over again.

331
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,080
Lin.

332
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,980
This is...

333
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,190
our family's symbol.

334
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:59,169
Master Lin is held down
at the interrogation hall.

335
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:00,699
- The interrogation hall?
- The Queen ordered men...

336
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,439
to send soldiers
to the Chancellor's house.

337
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,909
- What are you talking about?
- It is because of Sungjukjae...

338
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:07,010
Yong Je.

339
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:10,939
Where is So Hwa?
I do not see her around.

340
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,750
She went after Master Lin.

341
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:53,150
Father, did you want me?

342
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,170
Where is he?

343
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:09,540
Goodness, I am so tired.

344
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,360
So Hwa.

345
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,059
So Hwa.

346
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,000
I found the man
who killed my mother.

347
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:12,630
He is Lin's brother.

348
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:14,629
Everything will be over
once I kill him.

349
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:15,729
No.

350
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:17,470
That is the only way I can end this.

351
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,070
So Hwa.

352
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,450
No, that will hurt you.

353
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:28,780
Do not do that.

354
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:33,990
San.

355
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,080
(The King in Love)

356
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,800
Let us forget about everything...

357
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:36,950
and pretend like nothing happened.
Can you not do that?

358
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:38,450
He deceived me.

359
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,820
So I do not think I can do that.

360
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:43,490
I cannot pretend
like nothing happened.

361
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:46,160
You do know that...

362
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:48,830
Lin loves you, right?
Please forgive him.

363
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:51,830
I saw the way she looked at Lin.

364
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,170
And I saw the way Lin looked at her.

365
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:58,070
There is no way Lin would like
someone whom I like.

366
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,710
Do not be sick.

367
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:01,770
Have a safe trip.
