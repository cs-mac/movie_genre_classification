Thrill! Aka no Sho! Episode 2 by addictt9

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:11,710
Initially I had an accident, and then somehow I can see people's secrets.

3
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:15,580
So, can you menyewaku as an advisor?

4
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,720
What is it?

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,560
So. Sorry, but why should I?

6
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:32,100
I can see the thinking of scheming to defraud sensei.

7
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:37,730
Bullshit! It's up to you to want to talk about it.

8
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:40,070
We appreciate your feelings, but ...

9
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:43,370
Sensei does not need people with the strength of as-

10
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,410
Chief Sponsor, Goda-san.

11
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:50,080
You take advantage of your position as Chairman of the Sponsor.

12
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:55,750
Most political fund sensei you used to own perusahaanmu interests, right?

13
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,660
What you say?

14
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:02,360
I could see everything. Then ...

15
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,690
Taoka-san ...

16
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:09,570
Soon there will be people working with you.

17
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,370
And that person might be. ...

18
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,300
... kill you.

19
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,710
Kill me? It's not likely to happen.

20
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:21,010
Really?

21
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:28,250
You will need my strength.

22
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:33,390
According to police, they received a report that a man lying over the phone 110.

23
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,060
The names of the men it was Taoka Haruki.

24
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:45,400
The inventor of the first remains of this man was a local security guard.

25
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,070
He seems to find it when doing a morning patrol.

26
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:52,940
Dense rain Yes.

27
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:58,750
Oh, the suspect hit him with a blood-stained pipe it Yes.

28
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:02,620
It seems so.

29
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:07,360
But, why do these people have in place like this huh?

30
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,220
Thank you to JPSub for the Japanese Subtitles translated by DecaDroid8 Thrill! The Red Chapter!

31
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:33,250
Overnight, the murder of Haruki Taoka who was the Secretary of the legislative, Kenichiro Ohata occurs.

32
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:38,250
But it looks like a woman has warned him 3 months ago.

33
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,940
I've warned repeatedly Taoka-san ...

34
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:46,520
Briefly sekerjamu friends will kill you.

35
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,330
Do you know who the culprit?

36
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,530
Yes, but ...

37
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:56,360
Because he did not want to ask for protection to the police, then it cannot be avoided.

38
00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:00,280
How can you see the future?

39
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,220
Well, but the Minagawa Shoko-san is indeed very good Yes.

40
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:12,920
I figured it would be very helpful if the police recruited him here.

41
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:21,230
"It's happening now could change the future."

42
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:24,030
His victim, Taoka-san ...

43
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:32,710
What is lately there are problems associated with it?

44
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:37,050
Addressing the problem is her work Taoka-kun.

45
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,920
Ah, so yes.

46
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:46,390
Your Office late these days often accosted by a mysterious woman named Minagawa Shoko-san ya.

47
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:50,890
Yes. He's over to be advisory.

48
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:57,070
So, you believe in the power of the woman huh?

49
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,740
Its power is real.

50
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:03,010
Of course at first I also do not believe it.

51
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:08,680
But he proved all the work of corrupt bawahanku.

52
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,580
First, the Chairman of my Sponsor, Goda-san ...

53
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:15,020
... political funds embezzlement.

54
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:18,350
After kuselidiki, it turns out the word right.

55
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:21,650
Then I immediately dismissed Goda-san.

56
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:31,370
But, Taoka-kun is not at all believe it.

57
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:35,240
If he trust that woman ...

58
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,110
... maybe something like this will not happen.

59
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:42,710
He also dared to utilize members of Parliament.

60
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:45,050
Ah-Senior! -Ah, Kuroiwa-San!

61
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,380
Yes.

62
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:50,860
Based on reports from the criminal lab, they found this thing.

63
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,890
What is this?

64
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:54,390
May have belonged to the suspect.

65
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,430
Either.

66
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:59,060
-What is it? -I dunno ...

67
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,060
Candy?

68
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,670
Oi, oi mau until when making the police waiting for?

69
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:10,670
Outrageous.

70
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,380
There may be something he has planned.

71
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:20,580
Thank you for waiting. Please.

72
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,360
MINAGAWA-san, you ...

73
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,690
You have been predicting the death of the Taoka-san ya?

74
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:34,200
Correct. I already know whodunit.

75
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,700
Sorry, but we are here not to ask it.

76
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:42,040
-I want to? -My ass?

77
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:46,910
Us reveals the dirty work you now too.

78
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:52,680
Oh. Interesting. Please!

79
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:01,260
Kuroiwa-san, you use the money police ...

80
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,990
... to date many women, huh?

81
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,900
-Dating group huh? -Eh?

82
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,800
-He's just menggertakmu. -I know.

83
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,740
Three days ago you go where?

84
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:16,010
-If it's not wrong to Akasaka ...-wait-wait!

85
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:18,510
On five days ago you went to Roppongi right?

86
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,440
The name of his shop ...

87
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,010
-Already, Enough. -Kuroiwa-San!

88
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:27,880
Maybe there will be some people who will be menuduhkan at you.

89
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:33,680
It. ... Who?

90
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,700
You will soon know.

91
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,600
Later you will receive your phone.

92
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,030
Scary!

93
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:49,710
-The power of women is real! The way what the hell?

94
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:52,040
A lot of the right things.

95
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,460
EH?

96
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,310
Hello.

97
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:02,650
I am Nakano Hitomi from the Accounting Division of the police force.

98
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:10,660
Three days ago, you went to the Akasaka Navy Blue, and five days ago to Roppongi Dream Queen.

99
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,700
So I want to make sure of a few things.

100
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,530
Akasaka Navy Blue? Where is kutahu?

101
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:19,000
Ah there it is! I get there at night!

102
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,670
-Who is it? -Nakano.

103
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:23,610
But why is she menelponku?

104
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,010
Because you also get there with me.

105
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,940
Do not let that woman blocking us!

106
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,350
-Wait a minute! -Do you want fired?

107
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,680
-Our careers at stake tau! -Wait!

108
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,590
Dream Queen. Hello?

109
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:38,350
Ah, Hello! Nakano-kun huh?

110
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:40,480
Not fishy.

111
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:44,590
Suspicious.

112
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,380
Not fishy.

113
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,060
Not fishy. Not fishy.

114
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,700
Nakano-kun!

115
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,040
Fishy!

116
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,970
Not fishy.

117
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:02,650
This is why, here a great many odd notes.

118
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:07,320
By the way, how about we have dinner together?

119
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,650
Hah?

120
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:12,950
Fishy!

121
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:19,000
But, why suddenly took me here?

122
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,900
You many helped in the case yesterday ...

123
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,670
I haven't had a chance to thank you.

124
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,340
Any message that you like.

125
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,670
Either.

126
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:34,340
Ah! It was tasty!

127
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,680
EH?

128
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,720

129
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,850
Please enjoy.

130
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:44,650
8.900 yen.

131
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:52,560
I'm sorry. If that message could be gak ya?

132
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,030
It's okay. If ...

133
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:58,730
If you are requesting.

134
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,840
Excuse me!

135
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,880
Mmm! Yummy!

136
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,650
So ya. Thank goodness.

137
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:30,160
Sorry, excuse me.

138
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:44,350
-Hello? -How to deal with women accounting for it?

139
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:48,220
-Well that's how. -Don't tell me so!

140
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,220
Our destiny is at stake tau!

141
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:54,920
Well, I'll do something. By the way this is hard!

142
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,700
-Sorry! -What are you doing, basic sloppy!

143
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,600
I am sorry! I will immediately replace it with a new one.

144
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,070
Then the question of the last notes that ...

145
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:45,940
Then I and Kuroiwa-san is doing the investigation confidential.

146
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:50,410
So we stopped by briefly to make a report.

147
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:56,260
GAK! GAK! That does not mean the reason I asked you here!

148
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:03,690
A woman named Minagawa Shoko was not clairvoyant.

149
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:07,360
He's just a con!

150
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,700
-What now do you understand? -About what?

151
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:18,540
When I saw the Shoko-san on television, I so want to make sure what is real or not.

152
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:24,710
Then before Togawa-san consulted him, I found him.

153
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:28,380
I was there for a bit and then go.

154
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:31,290
Please wait a minute.

155
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:36,730
I thought in that room there's a hidden microphone.

156
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:42,400
He told people to wait, then she listens to their conversation.

157
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,300
And pretend as if he knew.

158
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,270
It is a mode of deception.

159
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:51,070
Then I did an experiment.

160
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:56,370
I pretended to be talking about information from n. Togawa-san and Kuroiwa-san.

161
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:02,290
It's a matter of note from Togawa-san and Kuroiwa-san from Division one.

162
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:05,690
After kuperiksa many a strange thing.

163
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:12,360
3 days ago to Akasaka Navy Blue, and on 19 February to Dream Queen Roppongi.

164
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,700
And then there are still more.

165
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,030
I think what kulaporkan is not better on tops ...

166
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:20,940
If only there's really no hidden microphone.

167
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:25,910
Then the things I said earlier it would surely have told the man.

168
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:28,540
If after Togawa-san to hear it ...

169
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:33,050
You brought me here so I did not discuss that issue.

170
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:36,720
-You're using us as guinea pigs? -Iya.

171
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,590
But thanks to that, I so know if he is a cheat.

172
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:44,390
If so tell me from the start.

173
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:48,260
At least say this before ordering.

174
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:51,730
Because these are things that cannot be bought, so. ..

175
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:56,070
Jeez ... don't mess around!

176
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:58,740
Hah?

177
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:06,710
You brought me here for the sake of covering up the bad things that you're doing, right?!

178
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:17,030
I figured this supervisor reported it is true Yes.

179
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:19,930
Ah! It looks delicious!

180
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:22,700
-It looks delicious Yes. -Messages that one, and her two.

181
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,600
-All right. -Excuse me, the message of wine two.

182
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,800
Oh! Such a handsome guy!

183
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:35,070
It looks like I drank too much wine.

184
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:51,730
Do not ever trust another person.

185
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:57,400
That's the thing the words written by my father before leaving.

186
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,700
Good morning! Thank you for last night.

187
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:35,570
Hey, why are you here?

188
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:40,040
Because last night I said it.

189
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:45,050
I know when Togawa-san came here early in the morning to make sure what is the hidden microphone.

190
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,720
-Come on! -Don't bother!

191
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,720
Please wait a minute.

192
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:27,220
You two are good acquaintances ya.

193
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:31,030
There is this thing in the waiting room.

194
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,960
This is a hidden microphone right?

195
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,700
I dunno, I've never seen it.

196
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:40,700
Lest it be yours eh?

197
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,380
The rings here ...

198
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,710
What do you always wear?

199
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:51,610
I lost it a few days ago.

200
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:54,580
It may just be stolen.

201
00:15:54,580 --> 00:16:00,280
The bracelet was found at the scene of his Taoka-san.

202
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:08,860
Then ...

203
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:25,950
Then the time killing Taoka-san on 23 February at 10 to 11 nights ...

204
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:30,890
You are no where at that time?

205
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:35,190
February 23, 10 p.m. until 11 p.m. ...

206
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:40,900
I'm on my way back here.

207
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,700
What anyone could ascertain the truth?

208
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:50,910
When I passed the garden Tsujiyama, I met with the former Chairman of Sponsor, Goda-san.

209
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:55,380
I don't know if he did want to meet with me or just a coincidence only.

210
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:59,250
It's a pity, but it is not possible.

211
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:05,890
According to a report of other investigators, Goda-san said that at this time he was in Office.

212
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:09,860
Employee named Morikawa ever justify his words.

213
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,660
Can you join me to the police station?

214
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,340
It seems that the detention warrant Minagawa Shoko already out ya.

215
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:27,240
Because the proof was already strong.

216
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,210
-Oh yes, Aono-kun-Ya.

217
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:36,350
Flake bracelet found on the scene apparently belonged to him, and I proved it.

218
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:40,350
Then she also lied.

219
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:46,700
He is indeed the conjunction is not good with Taoka-kun.

220
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:52,060
But I can see the good side of him.

221
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:57,710
Right, Kuramoto-kun?

222
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:00,310
Kuramoto!

223
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:03,980
YES.

224
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:09,850
MINAGAWA Shoko-san is an important person to me.

225
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:14,150
Please help fast Please free him.

226
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:22,670
Togawa-san!

227
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:25,330
I'm curious will be something.

228
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:28,000
The bracelet fall debris on the scene ...

229
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,670
I figured someone deliberately put it there.

230
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:32,610
What is it?

231
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:41,920
From the beginning of the perpetrators had planned to kill Taoka-san using a pipe iron, right?

232
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:45,350
Wait a minute, why are you can know if the killer is a pipe iron weapons?

233
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:48,020
EH? I saw it on the news.

234
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:51,360
It has not been published to the media.

235
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,700
Lest you see it from the book catatanku huh?

236
00:18:54,700 --> 00:19:01,300
Where possible! Her book brought Togawa-san continues, right?

237
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,640
Actually Togawa-san also minded ...

238
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:09,310
If the killer is someone else, right?

239
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:13,980
The death toll was hit from behind.

240
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,650
There were no signs of resistance.

241
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:22,990
Then, I think is not a coincidence if there is debris on the scene rings.

242
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:25,890
But, why Minagawa Shoko ...

243
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:28,860
its existence is a matter of lying at the time?

244
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:33,860
Maybe Goda-san was the one who lied.

245
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:43,680
Oi, come on!

246
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,980
Beware.

247
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,860
Sorry, according to the rule, please wear a helmet.

248
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,700
Ah, Yes.

249
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,030
Then please leave your stuff here.

250
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:06,900
-Yes. -Sorry.

251
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,600
Ah, you also ...

252
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:19,050
Pak police, sorry meet in a place like this.

253
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:25,720
I am Nakano Hitomi from the Accounting Division of the police force.

254
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,060
Tomita, please help point to the sector C.

255
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,730
Please follow me to the sector C.

256
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:36,400
Thank you for taking the time. This reserved Minagawa Shoko-san.

257
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,070
She said that on the night of the incident, you met him.

258
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:42,970
-What do you know? -No.

259
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:46,410
Somehow Minagawa-san to lie like that.

260
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:51,650
On that night I was with Morikawa-kun supervise the work in the Office.

261
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:54,080
Right, Morikawa-kun?

262
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,680
YES.

263
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,690
Really?

264
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:03,030
Just because it was asked by the head of the Pack ...

265
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:05,360
... you still shouldn't lie.

266
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,660
Where it might lie.

267
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:14,370
We know if you grudge against Minagawa.

268
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:17,040
But if on the night of the incident you are in Garden Tsujiyama for. ..

269
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:21,380
... met with Minagawa Shoko, then he is found not guilty.

270
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:25,710
No more need to talk about.

271
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:27,650
Oh yes, and while you're here ...

272
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:29,590
Could you have a look at a few of our projects?

273
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:34,720
When it is finished it will make Ohata-sensei will put great expectations on me.

274
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,020
Morikawa-kun, please transfer out Yes.

275
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,060
Please.

276
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:51,070
Hmmm .... Mr. Goda clearly lied to Yes.

277
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:57,070
The police might have done a big mistake Yes.

278
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:07,350
Then why the Pack heads told us to look at the unresolved project?

279
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:14,900
If so how about 120 million?

280
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:18,600
Well if so. Excuse me.

281
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:25,040
Well, I'm sorry all of a sudden there's a telephone.

282
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:30,910
I heard from the Police Department to question murder Secretary Ohata-sensei.

283
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:35,050
A woman named Minagawa Shoko has been arrested Yes.

284
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:43,260
Because the woman was also you have been fired from the post of head of her sponsor Ohata-sensei huh?

285
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:49,400
If so let's sue the woman in court.

286
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,730
-The lawsuit? Women have made you fired.

287
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:55,640
Then kill Taoka-san.

288
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:00,340
Surely he wanted to do something against the Ohata-sensei.

289
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:04,210
Now is the time to stand up to uphold justice!

290
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:10,550
But it is true if the flow of political funds sensei has me black out.

291
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:13,020
No, no. It is not a problem.

292
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:18,360
Please sit down. What are you sure? The woman is suspected of murder!

293
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:25,030
Otherwise you are the importance of Ohata-sensei in development.

294
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:28,900
You think the community will trust the which?

295
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:33,380
But if the woman is not the culprit ...

296
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:39,310
No, no. He was arrested because the police would have found strong evidence.

297
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,650
Sensei.

298
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:47,590
Actually I want to consult about one more thing.

299
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:49,590
The question of what?

300
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:55,290
Before that please berjanjilah if you're not going menghianatiku.

301
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:05,340
Until now I have never betrayed anyone.

302
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:09,950
-Chika-chan.-Yes.

303
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:14,680
Please buy food at the supermarket for our clients.

304
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:18,020
Either.

305
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:26,360
So, want to question what consultation?

306
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:31,700
The actual culprit is not Shoko Minagawa.

307
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:35,040
-What? -He has a strong alibi.

308
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:42,710
When I was questioned by the police, I'm lying if I met this lady in the garden Tsujiyama.

309
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:44,650
I figured when I met him

310
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:47,580
I think for swearing before him, but ...

311
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:57,590
When I talked to him, I kicked off the Board and ruin it.

312
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:09,200
I've been trying to clean up the paint that is inherent in the shoes, but not lost.

313
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:20,950
Sensei, can I membayarmu to improve papannya and please dispose of those shoes?

314
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:24,690
For the sake of Ohata-sensei, I let the woman was arrested.

315
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:28,360
It was the best thing I could do to sensei.

316
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,360
Please.

317
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:04,530
I'm Shirai Shinnosuke, a lawyer.

318
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:11,200
I can directly mengeluarkanmu from this place now.

319
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:19,010
MINAGAWA-san, during the night of the killing incident happens, you meet with Goda-san in the garden Tsujiyama, right?

320
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:23,680
Yes, but Goda-san denied it.

321
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:29,020
Of course, because it has a grudge Goda-san you.

322
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:33,520
Ah then when it Teased-san is angry ...

323
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,360
... What is she ruining something?

324
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:42,030
Ah yes, something in the garden.

325
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:44,700
-Nameplate! -Nameplate?

326
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,640
-Are you sure? -Iya.

327
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,040
I will soon mengeluarkanmu from here.

328
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,740
Leave it all on me, Shirai Shinnosuke.

329
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:57,610
This is the head of the Pack of loafer Goda.

330
00:26:57,610 --> 00:27:00,320
You can see there are spots of paint on his shoes.

331
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:06,660
This attaches when Mr. Goda Head damage the nameplate in the garden Tsujiyama.

332
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:14,660
After kuselidiki catnya stuck in the same night when the murder happened. — san Taoka

333
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:20,340
In other words, Goda-san kicked nameplate in the same time.

334
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:24,210
This is in accordance with the testimony of Minagawa Shoko-san.

335
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:28,680
If you think I'm lying, please go to the Park and check.

336
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,010
The woman ...

337
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:33,010
Not guilty.

338
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,890
MINAGAWA Shoko out!

339
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,690
MINAGAWA Shoko was arrested for the alleged murder of Haruki Taoka.

340
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:43,360
Then today was freed.

341
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,690
MINAGAWA-san what is your opinion ...

342
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:51,370
Well, this is definitely bothersome part investigator Yes.

343
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:55,040
I'm thankful is not a police officer.

344
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,710
Where national television stations?

345
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:01,980
This proves the inability of police to prove the truth.

346
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:10,650
I did menuntuk harsh punitive damages against police for Minagawa Shoko-san.

347
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:23,230
Aono-kun, this makes the image of the police force for the worse.

348
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:30,340
We should also apologize to the Ohata-sensei.

349
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:34,210
Kukeluarkan police will soon be in charge of the case.

350
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:43,020
This is bad!

351
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,950
MINAGAWA Shoko arrested too because ulahmu.

352
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:50,190
But, Kuroiwa-san, isn't it you who claimed to have caught it?

353
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:52,690
What is it?

354
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:00,940
Yes, this Togawa.

355
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:03,310
What is it?

356
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:07,980
MINAGAWA Shoko wants to meet with us.

357
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:17,020
We're here to apologize,

358
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:23,330
We're sorry!

359
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:27,660
Not what. I'm also sorry it's been a hassle.

360
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:32,270
If I say in detail when I met with Goda-san that night

361
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:35,200
Then you both will not engage the issue.

362
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,070
Well, if so ...

363
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:43,850
As long as you guys here and I will help you guys.

364
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:46,350
-Help? -I apologize in advance.

365
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:50,690
I know who killed Taoka-san.

366
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:53,020
Even without the need to see the work of dark somebody ...

367
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:55,920
Because it was obvious the culprit.

368
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,890
We do not need such power.

369
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,030
Please ...

370
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:07,330
Please let us know.

371
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:17,280
The culprit was the Second Secretary of the ...

372
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:24,050
Instead, it is now becoming first Secretary, Kuramoto-san.

373
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:26,390
The man looks very ambitious.

374
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:30,730
When Taoka-san does not exist, then he will be the first Secretary.

375
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:37,600
So, using a pernyataanku, he killed Taoka-san.

376
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,900
Excuse me.

377
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:48,080
The base of the damn lawyers! He menghianatiku.

378
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:52,410
But Goda-san, you're also lying to police.

379
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:56,280
The obvious culprit is the woman.

380
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,290
I am Yes, Kuramoto-san ...

381
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:02,690
Until now still think for the good of Ohata-sensei.

382
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:04,630
Though he was young ...

383
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:10,370
But she has a rare understanding.

384
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:15,000
Then everything is broken when the woman suddenly appeared.

385
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:22,380
Kuramoto-san lest you quite happy when Taoka-san dies huh?

386
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:27,650
What do you mean?

387
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:34,060
When Taoka-san dies, then the first Secretary kaulah!

388
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,990
Don't talk like that.

389
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:37,800
Correct, right?!

390
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:44,400
Lest kaulah Who Killed him!

391
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,300
Please stop this.

392
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:51,000
Don't you dare look at my eyes right!

393
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,680
Come on Goda-san!

394
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,610
Because I'm not drunk, I'll drop you home.

395
00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:04,020
Watch your head.  Put your feet.

396
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:08,360
-Sorry troublesome yes.  -Duduk correct yes.

397
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:13,030
We must do something for her.

398
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:16,360
Minagawa Shoko!

399
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:20,700
No matter what happened, the woman had to be removed.

400
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:24,000
You're the one who is responsible.

401
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:30,710
Can you buy me a drink of water?

402
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:33,380
Tu-wait a minute ya.

403
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:50,060
Air circulation is not good, so there are a lot of bad things happen.

404
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:53,940
Then the existing field across the road ...

405
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,940
Please planted tulips.

406
00:32:55,940 --> 00:33:01,340
Then place the fountain in the middle.

407
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:05,010
I think it will improve air circulation is good.

408
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:10,350
thanks.  Kuramoto, immediately contact authorities.

409
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:14,220
-Kuramoto! -Ah! Iya!

410
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:38,380
There is a need to do?

411
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:47,590
Please start now stay away from sensei!

412
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:51,590
Since you came, Sensei be strange!

413
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:55,730
Then why did you kill Taoka-san?

414
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:58,400
What next I?

415
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,340
What did you say?

416
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:04,010
What do you really want to sensei !?

417
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:05,920
Help!  Someone!

418
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:09,680
He'll kill me!

419
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:14,020
Ti-no!  Are you talking about?

420
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:21,020
Previously, sensei plans to bring up the biggest sports centers around the office.

421
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,960
Tapi, setelah play lidiki ...

422
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,890
The budget is not enough to plan.

423
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:28,900
Moreover, it is doubtful the plan will be profitable or not.

424
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:35,040
Sensei thought that the project would not be profitable, so she resisted.

425
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:43,040
But she was persuaded sensei to quickly finish the project.  Sensei also suddenly agree.

426
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,980
I think if this continues ...

427
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:47,720
It's enough talking.

428
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,050
Can I explain to you?

429
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:51,990
You killed Taoka-san the first secretary.

430
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:55,920
Lalu untuk menutupi itu, kau menggunakan Minagawa Shoko ...

431
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:59,390
Demi dikenal Ohata-sensei.

432
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:02,300
But he had a perfect alibi.

433
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,670
So in order not to compete, you kill him.

434
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:08,000
Please do not say anything bad like that!

435
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,870
When we checked the car, we find this thing.

436
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:14,880
Ini adalah gelang yang digunakan Minagawa Shoko-san kan?

437
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:20,350
After killing Taoka-san, you're leaving a few pieces of bracelets at the scene.

438
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:25,100
So you think killing is Shoko Minagawa-san.

439
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:28,690
I do not know this thing.

440
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:33,030
He wants to tell on me, so I forced him into a car.

441
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,960
How?

442
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,370
Do not you steal it from him huh?

443
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:40,700
What do you drive together?

444
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:47,280
Basic man mask!

445
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:52,250
It was a confession!  Well, the case is resolved.

446
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:56,380
Ah, thank goodness not be fired.

447
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:58,720
But I'm curious.

448
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,990
What?

449
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:03,890
What she is saying is always true.

450
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:09,190
We may be manipulated by the woman.

451
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:25,680
I'm very attracted to you.

452
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,350
Nice work you can find a hidden microphone.

453
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:33,690
But the real strength.

454
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:37,360
I could see all the things you are hiding.

455
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,260
I'll try to prove it right now.

456
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:42,960
Please.

457
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:49,040
Actually, you want to be a cop, huh?

458
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,710
But you can not.

459
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:58,010
Because it will be a problem if questioned about family information.

460
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:04,650
Your father is a criminal.  Is not it?

461
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:07,350
Fraudsters are very cunning.

462
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:19,000
Since childhood you and your father are always trying to avoid being caught by the police.

463
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:48,530
Hah?

464
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:05,310
-Halo? Togawa-san? -Iya, ada apa?

465
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:07,250
What Kuramoto-san has been arrested?

466
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:11,190
No, not yet.  Soon a letter out of his detention.

467
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:13,650
Kuramoto-san is not the culprit.

468
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:16,320
-Pelakunya are others.  -What?

469
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:21,200
I will go for sure!

470
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,200
Hei!

471
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:34,680
Then we set off, yes.

472
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,540
What's up?

473
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:53,560
Wait a minute.

474
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:58,030
From the police huh?  Is there anything you want to ask again?

475
00:38:58,030 --> 00:39:01,300
Turns out you're the mastermind behind all this is yes.

476
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,170
Minagawa Shoko-san hanyalah alat kejahatanmu.

477
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:07,170
What do you mean?

478
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:10,980
Earlier, Shoko-san suddenly appeared before me.

479
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:14,650
Then he mentions secrets.

480
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:19,320
Supposedly it surprised me but he just made a mistake.

481
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:23,990
About my father's a liar, and I really wanted to be a cop.

482
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:27,990
I think I've heard of it, so ...

483
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:36,000
I know he read it from here.

484
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Ah, this is a record of my imagination, so everything here is just a lie.

485
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:53,020
But this is precisely why my fantasy writings referred to as secret by Shoko-san?  Strange is not it?

486
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:57,360
Now that I think, there are peep this my notebook ...

487
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:01,230
Then tell Shoko-san.

488
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:06,030
It is true that the story is interesting, but ...

489
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:08,940
Is it just a mirage as you wrote in your book?

490
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:12,640
No, this is not an illusion anyway.

491
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:20,950
It fell when I opened my notebook.

492
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:31,990
After I checked, this is the same sand dust sand dust that is in this place.

493
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:41,030
That means people who work with Shoko-san is here and peek notebook.

494
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:49,080
Goda-san, when I and Togawa-san went to this place ...

495
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:53,080
You told Morikawa-san to leave luggage.

496
00:40:55,420 --> 00:41:00,020
Then we told you to look around.

497
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:04,690
I wonder why you do it.

498
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:13,030
You're doing it to check our baggage right.

499
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:26,050
In other words...

500
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:31,390
Working together is you, Goda-san.

501
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:33,720
Shut up and do not say anything stupid.

502
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:36,390
What can be proved by the sand dust?

503
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:40,730
Anyway, I was fired by Ohata-sensei for her.

504
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:44,400
So where might I collaborate with her?

505
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,070
What if it is part of your plan?

506
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:52,740
You deliberately let Shoko-san accused of embezzlement.

507
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:58,410
So people believe that Shoko-san's power is real.

508
00:41:58,410 --> 00:42:01,020
Your real purpose is ...

509
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:06,350
Using Shoko-san to control MPs Ohata.

510
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:09,690
I would say it is on the part of the investigation.

511
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:14,360
If it is checked again, would definitely see the evidence.

512
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,660
Excuse me.

513
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:24,570
Stop saying things that are not necessary.

514
00:42:57,910 --> 00:43:00,340
You do not mind do you?

515
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:02,340
Yes.

516
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:19,360
Your company will initially set up a new sports center yes.

517
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:26,030
If according to plan, then it will be a great advantage for your company.

518
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:30,910
But MPs Ohata know that it is suspicious.

519
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:34,380
So he rejected the plan.

520
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:38,250
By doing so you will lose big.

521
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:42,720
Then you plan on using Minagawa Shoko to control MPs Ohata.

522
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,720
What else can we do.

523
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:51,730
At that time, the constraints are Taoka-san.

524
00:43:51,730 --> 00:44:00,000
You know who pleaded not approve of the plan is the first secretary, Taoka-san.

525
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:05,270
So, most agree will plan the sports center is Taoka-san.

526
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:09,210
While Taoka-san was killed,

527
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:14,950
Aku sedang bertengkar dengan Minagawa Shoko di taman Tsujiyama.

528
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:18,690
Too bad, but I had a strong alibi.

529
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:21,590
You do not have an alibi.

530
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:26,290
Do you think we will immediately believe it?

531
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:29,960
Hear.

532
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:36,370
All the evidence now point if you cooperate with Minagawa Shoko.

533
00:44:36,370 --> 00:44:45,710
Shoko Minagawa that destroyed the nameplate and make these shoes no trace of paint.

534
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:51,720
When that, too, you killed Taoka-san.

535
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,650
Taoka-san...

536
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:06,000
You also make the Kuramoto-san was accused.

537
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,870
You put the rings in the car Kuramoto seemed as proof.

538
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:15,010
Drinking water can be traded?

539
00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:17,340
Wait a minute, please.

540
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:35,260
There are other reasons?

541
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:39,130
If only the seer was not negligence ...

542
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:42,370
The soothsayer ...

543
00:45:42,370 --> 00:45:48,040
Since the female detective discovered a hidden microphone, it becomes a problem.

544
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:52,380
So he came to me and told me to find out his secret.

545
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:56,720
However it is written in the book like the real thing.

546
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:03,050
But because of the greed of the seer, he made everything a mess.

547
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:11,030
We also will not be fooled ...

548
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:17,000
If the woman detective ...

549
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:22,510
... do not know if diintip by your notebook.

550
00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:30,680
-Hello to you.  -Why again, Shirai?

551
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:33,590
I think it will be a difficult trial, so ...

552
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:38,690
I would not mind if it should continue to be your lawyer.

553
00:46:38,690 --> 00:46:43,560
Of course, if the pay is appropriate.

554
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,570
I will not ask for help ...

555
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:50,040
... the traitor like you.

556
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,970
Come on.

557
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:28,340
You're not a cop.

558
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:34,040
So, do not again come to the suspect alone.

559
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:40,190
Sorry.

560
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:44,690
But if not done, then there would be no evidence ...

561
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:48,560
Lest you purposefully make Goda attack huh?

562
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:52,570
I did know that Togawa-san will come soon.

563
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:56,040
Look, do not do anything like that again.

564
00:48:01,310 --> 00:48:05,980
By the way you really do not want to show ...

565
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:10,850
... notebook that spy by Goda?

566
00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:12,850
Yes.

567
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:15,660
Its content is simply wishful thinking.

568
00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:24,000
What it's really just your imagination?

569
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,030
What?  Yes.
