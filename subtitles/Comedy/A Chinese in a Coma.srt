00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:10,960

3
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:02,970
With all things in this world, we must make a decision

4
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:07,700
For example, when there's no more love

5
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:11,270
You can either forget about her

6
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,850
Or let her forget bout you

7
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,100
I specializes in capturing demons

8
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:22,930
One day, Master told me to catch a spirit in the mountain

9
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,910
By then I understood.

10
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,400
It wasn't about my kungfu skills

11
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:00,760
But it was about my mind

12
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,380
Killing is not where the spirit's most dangerous

13
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,250
It's that they make you

14
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,610
Lose control

15
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,420
I am "Tiểu Thiến" >.<, and you're?

16
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,150
"Yến Xích Hà"

17
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,100
What is this, it's so good?

18
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,910
Candy

19
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,750
I want to eat it forever

20
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,460
I didn't buy that much

21
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,920
Then I'll fall in love with whoever buys me them

22
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:58,490
Human and spirits cannot be together?

23
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,490
Then just kill me

24
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:01,280
Kill!

25
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,070
From here on out

26
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,370
I won't be in pain anymore

27
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,750
Because

28
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,740
You won't remember me

29
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:30,920
"Yến Xích Hà",
Attack her fatal point!

30
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,360
Cut off my hand!
Seal it with the enchanted weapon

31
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:17,580
Hurry!

32
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:30,110
Wait till the day I break the seal..

33
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:33,330
That will be your funeral day!

34
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,630
Losing one arm is nothing

35
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:39,010
But I've lost 3 of my brothers

36
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:40,620
"Yến Xích Hà"

37
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:44,490
You don't deserve to be a Spirit Master

38
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:17,370
I've think it through,
Human and spirits can't coexist

39
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,520
So I repressed our memories

40
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,800
To make her forget about our love

41
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,800
To make her forget about me forever

42
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:32,380
But I couldn't have known that
When that young man entered "Black Mountain"

43
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:37,630
The story between me and her then continues

44
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:08,390
translated by cudencuden via viet sub from Blue Magic | bluemagic1407@hotmail.com

45
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:14,130
Eh, young blood! What you doing? Stealing water?

46
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,030
No, ... I'm not

47
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,470
Get him

48
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,490
Bring these stuff back too

49
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:33,310
Chief, these things are strange. \nWhat are they for?

50
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,430
You brought so many equipments here

51
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,810
Must be to steal our water

52
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,770
Cut off his hands!

53
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,530
Right!

54
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:47,440
This isn't "Black Mountain" village,\nBut "Black/Evil Mind" village

55
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:48,980
Unlawful, barbaric people

56
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,180
I'm an official of the government

57
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,700
Chief!

58
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:57,350
Make way

59
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,950
Chief, He's..

60
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,960
What's matter with you?

61
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,690
He's

62
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,880
What's your name?

63
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,300
I'm "Ninh Thái Thần"

64
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,600
"Ninh Thái Thần"

65
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:36,480
Our village is well known in the South

66
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:38,480
for these clay pots

67
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,410
They haven't been used much

68
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:48,760
because there isn't much water

69
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,770
Can't even raise livestocks

70
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:55,740
We need to find a water source

71
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:59,770
Right,
We wrote letters to the mayor

72
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,590
Asking for help

73
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:05,500
You're really our savior for coming here

74
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,410
Don't say that

75
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:08,710
I'm just a small official for the govt.

76
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,120
You guys call just call me "Ninh Thái Thần"

77
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:14,130
You're an official, we have to call you "Sir"

78
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,130
Right, right, "Sir" Ninh

79
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,610
What is this that I see hanging everywhere?

80
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,610
Of course, "charms" are for warding off evil

81
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:26,450
Get lost!

82
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,110
We hang them to pray for rain

83
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,040
It's to pray for rain

84
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,790
Everyone come here

85
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:36,790
Come greet "Sir" Ninh

86
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:38,990
"Sir" Ninh is our savior

87
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:44,630
I promise everyone

88
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,160
I will find a water source

89
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,940
If not I won't go back down

90
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:50,590
Good!

91
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,930
Order

92
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:59,100
Sir, the people are really grateful to you

93
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:02,210
Although, there's one thing I'd like to ask of you

94
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,210
Please say it

95
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,250
One, alone, cannot go find a water source

96
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:10,060
I need strong helpers

97
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,390
to go up the mountain

98
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:13,210
What? Up the mountain?

99
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,190
Is something wrong?

100
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:19,590
If you just go up the mountain, everything'd be fine

101
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:23,370
"Sir" Ninh, it's fine.
- It's alright, go back

102
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:26,260
"Sir" Ninh, please wait

103
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,690
I am "Thiết Nha"

104
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,470
I want to go up with you

105
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:35,570
Good. The more the merrier

106
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,060
Why do they have chains around their feet?

107
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:41,130
They all are prisoners

108
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:43,970
The Chief allowed them to do some good

109
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,810
Sir...Ninh

110
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,870
When I was little, my father and brother

111
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:52,530
Used to take me up the mountain all the time

112
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,240
on this road

113
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,180
If you don't leave markings

114
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:01,250
You'd get lost easily

115
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,690
Wait for me a little bit

116
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,910
Without you as a guide I'd be lost

117
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,700
Don't worry

118
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:12,740
With me here, everything's fine

119
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,610
Go

120
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,970
Careful, don't fall

121
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,490
My leg.
- At this rate,

122
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:38,620
We will all be handicapped before finding water

123
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,120
It's just a small injury, stop whining

124
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:41,650
When are we gonna get there

125
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,920
They'd walk more comfortable

126
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,310
If we lose the chains

127
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,250
Can't

128
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:49,990
They only committed small crimes and shouldn't be punished like this

129
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:51,840
What small crimes?

130
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,940
They're all murderers

131
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:55,810
Killed people?

132
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,340
If we aren't facing the death penalty

133
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,120
Whose dumb enough to go up here?

134
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:03,440
Lets go

135
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,080
It's alright, just be a little more careful

136
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:10,030
Not with these guys but what's up there

137
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,690
What's up there?

138
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,350
Nothing, just be a little more careful

139
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:19,280
Be careful

140
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:34,340
"Sir" Ninh, look

141
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,760
Dig a little deeper

142
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,390
Deeper

143
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,970
On the way here, it's nothing but dry/dead plants

144
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,420
But here's the vegetation is flourished

145
00:12:58,890 --> 00:12:59,680
Might have water here

146
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,320
I think a water source might be found

147
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,880
That's excellent

148
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,300
You help me watch them

149
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,180
Don't worry

150
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:08,590
Don't be wasting time

151
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,910
Here's candy for you

152
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,790
"Sir" Ninh

153
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,130
God, why's it like this?

154
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:03,700
Not sure

155
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:06,930
Let's go back. Can't stay when it's dark like this

156
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,060
You crazy? It's a long way back

157
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,290
Any place we can stay temporarily?

158
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:13,890
There's a shrine up ahead

159
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,570
Let's pack up and go.

160
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,820
Hurry!

161
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,010
Don't be scared

162
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,570
There's water?

163
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:56,570
There's water in here

164
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:03,990
There's water

165
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:05,300
It's really water

166
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,910
Give me a hand

167
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,990
This is water

168
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,990
Drinkable?

169
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,530
What are you doing?

170
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,550
Finding out how deep it is

171
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,650
This might be the water source we're looking for

172
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:52,560
Good!

173
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,670
You guys achievement today is not that bad

174
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:05,500
Where's everyone?

175
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,080
I'll go look for them

176
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,610
Don't let them escape

177
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,270
What are you afraid of? Am I really ugly?

178
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,080
What are you doing miss?

179
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:05,650
Doing what all you mean likes to do

180
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:10,470
Miss, please, don't

181
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:16,600
Our elder used to teach us to "welcome guests enthusiastically"

182
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,500
You don't like it?

183
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:25,060
No, I've never tried before

184
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:29,940
I know

185
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:33,800
You haven't tried.
It doesn't mean you don't want it

186
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,090
You will like it

187
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,070
Miss ! Please don't!

188
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,260
You're so bad

189
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,060
I'm so sorry!

190
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,600
What is that?

191
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,910
What's what

192
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:59,410
It's jade charm for protection

193
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,720
Take it off so I can see it

194
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,660
Take it off

195
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,420
Here you go

196
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:11,520
Doesn't matter if you keep feeding

197
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,520
I'll beat it out of you guys

198
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,330
Hey

199
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:54,820
You scared me to death

200
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,070
You risked your live\nJust to get the charm back?

201
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:14,710
Are you sad? A gift from your lover?

202
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,750
My mom left me this

203
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:23,430
Hey, look at me

204
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,940
If you won't look at me\nThat means you're mad

205
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,530
I don't dare think that

206
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:37,980
Sir Ninh, we're in trouble

207
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:40,340
We were killed by demons

208
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:49,590
"Thiết Nha"

209
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,090
A killer! Run miss

210
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,620
Run!

211
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,770
We're fight again another time

212
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,410
His skills are not bad

213
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,340
Who'll see who's better

214
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,970
Can't go there, go here

215
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,920
Why're we back where we start?

216
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:05,800
What?

217
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,790
That bearded guy is here

218
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:09,430
You follow me

219
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:36,150
He will come back

220
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,150
Sit down

221
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,410
"Black Mountain" is really full of evil/strangeness/mystery

222
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:59,730
We're gonna spend the night here
Why not find something to do?

223
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:02,560
Doing what

224
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:12,500
Strange

225
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,330
Not even a tiny scent

226
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,140
What scent?

227
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:21,260
"He's a good person"

228
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:23,480
Oh yeah

229
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:25,070
Miss

230
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,900
What's it?

231
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:31,820
That killer is still around

232
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,170
Be real careful

233
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:37,750
Stay here longer,
It's safer here

234
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,870
Are you really scared of dying?

235
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,550
What's your name?

236
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,260
"Ninh Thái Thần"

237
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:50,770
I'm "Tiểu Thiến"

238
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:02,350
I have something for you

239
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:04,990
What is it?

240
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,340
Sugar candy, it's good

241
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,470
You like it?

242
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:17,020
It's all yours

243
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:23,180
Don't know when I have a chance

244
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:24,140
To treat you to candy again

245
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:31,690
Running all night is really tiring

246
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,560
Wake me in the morning

247
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:12,660
God's Vision!

248
00:27:59,260 --> 00:27:59,990
Look

249
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,050
"Yến Xích Hà", Man got his path, spirits got theirs

250
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:10,070
Why do you keep following me?

251
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,930
With I'm here, lets see if you can kill

252
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,690
Stop dreaming

253
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:15,940
When I get out...

254
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:17,960
If you get out, you demon!

255
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,440
What are you doing scaring me from behind?

256
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,820
Can't believe you going back to "Lan Nhược Tự" by yourself

257
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,520
Aren't you scared?

258
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:30,940
What did you throw into the water earlier?

259
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:32,470
It's a torpedo/bomb

260
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:34,000
Torpedo/bomb?

261
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:35,650
Don't touch it

262
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:37,650
It'll blow

263
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:40,270
Thats amazing

264
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,680
If I'm right

265
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,640
This water will flow to the right place

266
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:47,170
Then "Black Mountain" village will have water

267
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:53,980
"Ninh Thái Thần" don't move\nStay quiet

268
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:55,980
Just pretend you don't hear and see anything

269
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:57,350
Why?

270
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:01,480
If you want to get out alive then listen to me

271
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:04,470
I don't know why us two get along so well?

272
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:08,020
Of course, cause we both don't like...

273
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,800
that "Tiểu Thiến"!

274
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,770
No wonder "Lady Elder"
say good things about her everyday

275
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:23,030
Already has a catch
so early in the day

276
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,830
"Tiểu Thiến", If this keeps up, how are we gonna survive?

277
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:29,130
You guys are late

278
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:31,130
He's mine

279
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,950
Why's there still breathing sound?

280
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:43,690
Wanna take my meal?\nKnow your place

281
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:50,640
What's so funny? The one "Lady Elder" hates most is you

282
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:53,250
Over 10 days and still no good food for "Elder Lady"

283
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,660
Let me teach you in place of her

284
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,540
Why are you still here? Get gone!

285
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:03,350
Go find good food for her

286
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:17,310
"Ninh", Run

287
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:18,510
They will kill you

288
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,000
Tricked us?

289
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:53,010
"Tiểu Thiến"

290
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,270
"Tiểu Thiến"

291
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,010
"Tiểu Thiến"

292
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,160
"Tiểu Thiến", "Tiểu Thiến"

293
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:16,280
Why did you come?

294
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:17,040
Go

295
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:19,570
Let me go!

296
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:23,120
I don't care who you are\nOr whether you die or not

297
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,340
But you cannot stay in "Black Mountain"

298
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,620
If they feast on you\nThey'll become stronger

299
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:27,630
My life'll become harder

300
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:29,610
Let me go...

301
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,970
Stay still if you don't wanna die

302
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:07,960
Where's he?

303
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:08,900
Who?

304
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:10,740
His name's "Ninh Thái Thần"

305
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,130
He got eaten by you

306
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:17,790
Don't you remember??

307
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:21,240
Then why did you save me?

308
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,450
I will kill you,
If you keep hurting people

309
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,660
I know you're a great Spirit Master

310
00:34:30,890 --> 00:34:32,430
and won't let me go easily

311
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,620
I won't forget that you saved me today

312
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,400
I'm grateful and in your debt

313
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:41,950
You should forget

314
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,370
Don't move

315
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:55,010
You won't kill me

316
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,650
Want me to kill you this instance??

317
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,040
Right now, you're in more danger than me

318
00:34:59,090 --> 00:34:59,720
What?

319
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:09,020
I won't kill you either

320
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,420
Bearded guy

321
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:31,440
Feel comfortable?

322
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,610
You only tie one of his leg up?

323
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:39,300
Don't you think he looks adorable tied like this?

324
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,750
Lets go

325
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,720
Sorry

326
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,550
Before I said that you're afraid to die

327
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:05,090
Really?

328
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,160
In reality, you're not afraid at all

329
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:09,750
If not you wouldn't come back to save me

330
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:12,650
Honestly, I am scared

331
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:16,730
Then why did you come back?

332
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,210
What will you do now?

333
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,370
I'm going back down

334
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:28,190
Down the mountain

335
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:31,940
Do you still have sugar candy?

336
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,380
Yes

337
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,950
"Tiểu Thiến", Come with me

338
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,210
Now that I've found the water source

339
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:56,280
I can take you sightseeing

340
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,680
- You want me to come along?
- Yes

341
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:02,330
It's a big world out there.

342
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,170
A lot bigger compared to "Black Mountain"

343
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,960
And it have many more delicious type of candy

344
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:08,140
And many other amazing things

345
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:10,530
Come with me?

346
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,540
"Tiểu Thiến"

347
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,630
"Tiểu Thiến"

348
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:20,090
"I'm hungry"

349
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,810
Bring that young man back

350
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:25,000
What is it?

351
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,000
It's getting dark

352
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,520
Follow me

353
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,020
Why are you walking so fast?

354
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:35,380
"Tiểu Thiến"

355
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,010
"I'm hungry"

356
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:41,960
"Hurry and bring the young man back"

357
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:49,430
Don't run so fast

358
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:51,100
Hold on to me tight

359
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:53,570
"Where are you going?"

360
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:57,550
"Tiểu Thiến"... "I'm hungry!"

361
00:37:58,290 --> 00:37:59,900
"Tiểu Thiến", What makes you run so fast?

362
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:01,260
- It's only strong winds. - Don't ask!

363
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,380
"I'm hungry"

364
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:07,300
"Bring him back to me"

365
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,680
"Come back"

366
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,920
What are you doing?

367
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:15,870
I

368
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:18,710
I wanna give you a piece of candy

369
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:21,140
To trick me to follow you?

370
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:22,540
- "Tiểu Thiến". - Is that what you think of me?

371
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,990
It ain't like that

372
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:25,990
Go just go

373
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,990
But we made an agreement

374
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:29,410
You need to leave

375
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:31,990
- Shortie. - Whose your shortie?

376
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,000
Why did you change so quickly?

377
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:35,680
I like it!

378
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,180
- Go way. - I won't!

379
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:40,590
Go go go!

380
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:41,950
"I won't"

381
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,520
"Tiểu Thiến, why won't you come back?"

382
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,700
"Tiểu Thiến"

383
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,130
"You won't obey Lady Elder words?"

384
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,180
Chief, Sir Ninh is back

385
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:25,180
I told you "Sir" Ninh has 9 lives

386
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:27,180
"Sir" Ninh

387
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:29,180
Sir

388
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:31,320
Thank you, "Black Mountain" village now has water

389
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,170
Really?

390
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:34,070
Chief

391
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:37,080
Everyone can celebrate \nBut don't waste too much water

392
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,690
Don't waste the water!

393
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:40,710
Besides

394
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:43,330
Those that came with me are now missing

395
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:46,330
They were all facing the death penalty anyway!

396
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:51,330
Greatness comes with great sacrifices

397
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:52,730
Let's not talk about those things

398
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:53,970
Chief... Chief

399
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:56,430
"Thiết Nha"

400
00:39:57,650 --> 00:39:58,960
"Thiết Nha", are you okay?

401
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:03,780
Chief, him and the "demon"

402
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:05,260
What "dees"?

403
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:08,470
Look at you, so dirty\nGo take a bath!

404
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,680
"Black Mountain" village now has water. Let's shower

405
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:12,350
Yes, shower. - Him and "dee.."

406
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,350
Demon!

407
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:16,350
Sir, you are right

408
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:19,300
We should be grateful\nWe can't be wasting water

409
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:22,680
We're just gonna party till dawn (lol)

410
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:25,150
Splash him!

411
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:32,900
Speak

412
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:35,390
Why did you let him go?

413
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:38,570
"Lady Elder"

414
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:43,180
I will find better food for you

415
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,080
You love him?

416
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:51,340
I just can't see myself hurting him

417
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:55,790
"Lady Elder" you once said "The difference between us and humans is"

418
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,600
"that spirits can do whatever they like"

419
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,720
I said that?

420
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:09,840
I did say that

421
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:16,170
But in this place, you can only listen

422
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:20,910
To what I say, Not actually do it

423
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:24,310
Here at "Lan Nhược Tự"

424
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,100
There's only one boss

425
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,160
That person is me

426
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:37,560
You all will never be reincarnated

427
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:43,520
So just focus on serving your master, ME!

428
00:41:44,649 --> 00:41:49,649
<i><font color=yellow>Subtitle by</i></font>
<b><font color=Red>Aldi Arman</b></font>

429
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:50,840
Come on

430
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:54,840
Savior, Drink one with me

431
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,520
I drank so much already

432
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:01,260
Oh yeah, this is my niece

433
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,010
Sit down

434
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:05,530
Greets "Sir" Ninh,
offer him a drink

435
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,740
- "Sir" Ninh, please drink one.
- Oh, I cannot drink anymore

436
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:11,470
I'll drink first

437
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,210
She can drink!

438
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:25,600
Sir Ninh, this is really good

439
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:27,870
No, let me do it

440
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:30,080
You guys take your time

441
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:32,690
Make sure you service him good

442
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,700
"Sir" Ninh, what are you looking at?

443
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,020
Nothing

444
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:47,310
Eat something

445
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:50,880
You know what my fav thing to eat?

446
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:56,250
Sugar candy

447
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,090
Okay, I'll go buy it

448
00:42:58,230 --> 00:42:58,690
No

449
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,610
I'll go myself

450
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:03,620
I'll go

451
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:05,780
Where're you going?

452
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:07,880
Restroom

453
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:10,720
You gonna find candy in the restroom?

454
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:17,190
"Tiểu Thiến"

455
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,350
"Tiểu Thiến"

456
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,420
Stop right there

457
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:32,540
You misunderstood me

458
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:35,630
I'm the good guy

459
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:39,060
I saw you killed people at "Nhược Lan" Shrine

460
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:40,540
The ones I killed

461
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:42,700
They weren't people

462
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,270
You're a brutal murderer, you're the one not human

463
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,200
I know my appearance can mislead people

464
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:53,390
Listen to me, I'm a Spirit Master

465
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:56,040
Things I killed are all demons

466
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:57,280
Lies!

467
00:43:57,710 --> 00:43:58,810
Why would I trick you?

468
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:01,810
You're saying "Tiểu Thiến" is a demon too?

469
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:07,420
Yes, she is a demon

470
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:08,720
She is not

471
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:09,680
She is

472
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:10,420
No

473
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:11,100
Yes

474
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:13,590
Let me down and I'll show you my "Demon Mirror"

475
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:14,820
Take it out

476
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:17,400
Why are you like that?

477
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:18,480
I'll help you get it

478
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:19,640
You know how to use it?

479
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:22,850
You just tricking me to untie you

480
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,020
You just don't want to face the truth

481
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:39,020
What you're doing

482
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:41,770
Just untie me, don't chop down the tree

483
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:07,000
That's enough, you can't even hold a sword right

484
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,610
Where're you going?

485
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,600
You tricked me to save you

486
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:18,410
Let me borrow your power from heavens and earth!

487
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:19,970
Didn't work, again

488
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:25,730
Why don't you have a look

489
00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:29,240
Lan Nhược Tự is just a thousand years old spirit

490
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:32,930
You lucky you didn't die and could escape

491
00:45:34,010 --> 00:45:36,680
Down the mountain is that way

492
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:41,900
Hey, where you going?

493
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:45,150
I don't believe in your trickery

494
00:45:45,330 --> 00:45:46,380
I'll go find "Tiểu Thiến" myself

495
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:50,610
Are you crazy? I just said she's a demon

496
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:54,660
Don't tell me you like her

497
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:55,920
None of your beeswax

498
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,020
It is my business

499
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:59,440
You must forget about her

500
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:01,650
I cannot do it

501
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:04,260
You must turn back now, else it'd too late

502
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:10,620
Which way is to "Lan Nhược Tự"?

503
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,130
"Blinded by demons"

504
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:17,370
Okay! You wanna die I'll let you

505
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:20,890
"Lan Nhược Tự" is that way. Go ahead!

506
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:27,950
Have a safe trip, to your afterlife!

507
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:34,760
"Tiểu Thiến"

508
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:43,620
"Thiến"

509
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:00,040
Ninh

510
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:04,840
I'm a demon

511
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:07,430
I know

512
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:17,640
Want it?

513
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:29,610
I'll get you out of "Black Mountain"

514
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:34,800
- I have no strength.
- I'll carry you

515
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,550
"Tiểu Thiến", why's your entire body so cold?

516
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:58,360
I'm under "Lady Elder" spell.\nDon't look back

517
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:02,300
If you look back we will never make it out

518
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:05,220
Just let me down and run

519
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:07,440
I'd rather die here

520
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:26,190
Oh no

521
00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:28,190
I'm under a spell

522
00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:45,150
"Lâm - Binh - Đấu - Giả"

523
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:46,820
"Tĩnh"

524
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:00,670
With this tide

525
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:04,950
"Yến Xích Hà", you can't make it to land

526
00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:11,790
Lets rest here for the night, we'll head out in the morning

527
00:49:13,690 --> 00:49:16,640
Don't worry, they won't find out that you're a demon

528
00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:33,240
It's so messy here, bare with me

529
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:35,310
I'll find a better place tomorrow

530
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,920
I'll be warmer when the fire's lit

531
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:00,990
Feel any better?

532
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:03,570
Let me find something for the cold

533
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,280
Is it better like this?

534
00:50:15,690 --> 00:50:17,690
How's this? Any better?

535
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:25,080
"Ninh Thái Thần"

536
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,200
You really want to take me with you?

537
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:36,720
You're not afraid that I'm a demon?

538
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:43,410
"I'm scared of poverty yet I'm still poor"

539
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:47,980
"I'm scared of boredom, still I'm bored"

540
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:52,760
That's just fate

541
00:50:54,330 --> 00:50:56,330
Things we don't like still comes to us

542
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:00,730
But I'm still worry

543
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:06,620
You'll be like the others and eat human flesh

544
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,000
They don't eat human flesh

545
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:12,350
But didn't your friends

546
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:15,650
Killed and ate those "Black Mountain" villagers at "Lan Nhược Tự?

547
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:18,570
They don't want to eat human flesh

548
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:21,720
They just want your "Soul / Chi"

549
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,490
I know those guys are innocent

550
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:30,090
If they weren't lustful

551
00:51:31,930 --> 00:51:33,580
Then they won't emit a scent

552
00:51:35,370 --> 00:51:37,370
"Lady Elder" won't be able to smell them

553
00:51:38,610 --> 00:51:40,610
And we wouldn't have caught them

554
00:51:44,050 --> 00:51:46,050
I don't have the scent that you talked about?

555
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,230
You're good person

556
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:57,120
We don't have a choice

557
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:04,250
That year, "Lady Elder" got sealed by a Spirit Master. Her "Chi" was damaged

558
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:09,020
"Lady Elder" put all of us under a spell

559
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:13,280
She made us gather "Chi" for her. So she can break the seal

560
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:19,010
We'll be punished if we disobey

561
00:52:23,430 --> 00:52:24,430
Even death

562
00:52:27,550 --> 00:52:30,120
Don't be afraid, I'll get you out of here

563
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:34,330
From now on, you don't need to worry anymore

564
00:52:38,670 --> 00:52:40,670
"Tiểu Thiến", are you okay?

565
00:52:41,230 --> 00:52:42,760
Were you hurt badly?

566
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:45,470
I'll go find a doctor, and medicine

567
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,990
It's Lady Elder's magic. It's no use

568
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:54,790
You can take my "Chi"

569
00:52:55,270 --> 00:52:57,290
It'll help you recover

570
00:52:57,570 --> 00:52:58,480
Take it

571
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,170
Are you any better now?

572
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:43,220
If you need any more, I still have enough

573
00:53:43,850 --> 00:53:44,790
Take it

574
00:53:46,910 --> 00:53:48,470
Why are you smiling?

575
00:53:49,670 --> 00:53:50,770
I can smell it

576
00:53:51,430 --> 00:53:52,110
What?

577
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:53,920
Right now you have that "scent"

578
00:53:56,050 --> 00:53:57,840
What scent?

579
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:10,820
That's really it

580
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:14,080
The heaven is earth, the dimension is flipped

581
00:55:14,930 --> 00:55:17,430
You demon you, that's the reason why

582
00:55:18,030 --> 00:55:19,670
I'll break your spell

583
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:28,640
So dizzy

584
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:32,530
That little demon, think you can trap me?

585
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,310
You're up

586
00:55:44,130 --> 00:55:45,920
I'll go fix something to eat

587
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:48,160
"Ninh""

588
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:54,970
It's nothing

589
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:02,060
"Nhiếp Tiểu Thiến"

590
00:56:22,810 --> 00:56:25,190
I'll let you taste this barrel of dog's blood

591
00:56:26,410 --> 00:56:28,820
You'll turn into your true form fo sho

592
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:56,970
"Tiểu Thiến"

593
00:57:00,090 --> 00:57:02,050
You really scared of me?

594
00:57:05,570 --> 00:57:07,100
I won't swallow you

595
00:57:09,450 --> 00:57:11,040
You're not human

596
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:17,800
Lady Elder

597
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:20,440
Please spare me

598
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:23,180
You think that I'll hurt you?

599
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:26,020
The plead you said earlier

600
00:57:26,790 --> 00:57:29,710
Really is what I have in mind

601
00:57:30,370 --> 00:57:31,620
Even though

602
00:57:32,270 --> 00:57:34,560
You took off without even saying goodbye

603
00:57:35,590 --> 00:57:38,650
But I'm not as evil as you think

604
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:41,180
This time I'm here to

605
00:57:42,070 --> 00:57:43,730
say goodbye to you

606
00:57:44,550 --> 00:57:47,820
These past years, you mesmerize so many men

607
00:57:49,310 --> 00:57:53,550
Now, you actually found one that mesmerizes you

608
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:56,530
I admire it

609
00:57:57,580 --> 00:57:59,760
I'm honestly happy for you

610
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:03,620
But you have to remember 1 thing

611
00:58:04,990 --> 00:58:08,390
Your fox's spirit is still at "Lan Nhược Tự"

612
00:58:11,870 --> 00:58:14,690
You can't go anywhere without it

613
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:21,560
Warrior

614
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:23,710
You're still alive, that's great

615
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:26,240
Where is "Tiểu Thiến"

616
00:58:26,890 --> 00:58:27,540
She's...

617
00:58:29,610 --> 00:58:30,240
Ran away

618
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:30,860
Got away?

619
00:58:34,890 --> 00:58:36,890
Eating that much by yourself?

620
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:39,150
I'm starving

621
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,210
Why's there 2 pairs of chopsticks

622
00:58:45,770 --> 00:58:47,770
Trying to fool me, you're with her aren't you?

623
00:58:49,850 --> 00:58:51,630
What did you two do?

624
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:52,990
We..

625
00:58:54,610 --> 00:58:57,450
You sex seeking fiend!

626
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:03,890
There's demon's scent

627
00:59:04,850 --> 00:59:06,330
Who's there besides "Tiểu Thiến"?

628
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:07,980
Nobody

629
00:59:10,930 --> 00:59:13,230
I won't let you hurt "Tiểu Thiến"

630
00:59:19,550 --> 00:59:20,830
"Thụ Yêu"?

631
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:22,960
Return to your "Black Mountain", You can't stay here

632
00:59:23,410 --> 00:59:24,410
Don't you worry about it

633
00:59:25,090 --> 00:59:26,820
You don't have a choice, lets go!

634
00:59:29,510 --> 00:59:31,510
I say there's no need

635
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,050
"Ninh Thái Thần"

636
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:36,440
"Ninh Thái Thần"

637
00:59:37,050 --> 00:59:39,050
What "Ninh", lets go

638
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:55,570
Splashing dog's blood, what's the use?

639
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:05,710
It'll hurt more if you struggle, lets go

640
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:41,500
"Hạ Tuyết Phong Lôi", what're you up to?

641
01:00:41,590 --> 01:00:42,750
I'm about to..

642
01:00:47,830 --> 01:00:48,760
Running away demon?

643
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:29,940
retrieve

644
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:38,080
"Yến Xích Hà",
Just look at yourself

645
01:01:38,590 --> 01:01:39,950
You call yourself a Spirit Master

646
01:01:40,350 --> 01:01:41,950
But can't see what's right and wrong

647
01:01:42,390 --> 01:01:43,950
Hanging around these demons everyday

648
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:45,460
You're something else

649
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:48,130
So what? Wanna keep fighting?

650
01:01:49,290 --> 01:01:49,940
Think you can beat me?

651
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:51,940
I can't beat you?

652
01:01:52,470 --> 01:01:53,180
Playing me?

653
01:02:32,530 --> 01:02:34,040
Why are you really here?

654
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:34,970
I'm here to teach you a lesson

655
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:36,500
What so good about you?

656
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:38,800
After I retrieve the demon, \nI'll deal with you

657
01:03:17,110 --> 01:03:18,580
You guys...look

658
01:03:20,010 --> 01:03:22,010
I still beat you with my one arm only

659
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:24,260
If you wanna kill just kill

660
01:03:25,910 --> 01:03:27,040
"Hạ Băng", retrieve the demon!

661
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:42,590
Demon...

662
01:03:44,350 --> 01:03:46,080
"Tiểu Thiến"! I've come to save you

663
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,420
De..mon

664
01:03:57,690 --> 01:03:59,360
Chief, it's a monster

665
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:05,720
It's alright, I'm here, don't worry

666
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:07,300
Your hand

667
01:04:17,150 --> 01:04:18,510
"Hạ Băng", they're under the demon's spell

668
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:24,730
Everybody calms down

669
01:04:25,010 --> 01:04:27,390
Chief, gather everyone here.\nWe've got a solution

670
01:04:38,490 --> 01:04:40,790
Chief, what happened?

671
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:42,830
Are we gonna turn into monsters?

672
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:44,020
Think of something

673
01:04:44,190 --> 01:04:44,840
Chief

674
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:45,720
Everyone quiet

675
01:04:47,110 --> 01:04:49,900
I've something to discuss

676
01:04:50,830 --> 01:04:52,830
This thing is grown from our body

677
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:57,590
The more we panic the faster it'll grow

678
01:04:58,180 --> 01:05:01,440
Thus we must remain calm

679
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:08,620
You, how come you're okay?

680
01:05:08,790 --> 01:05:09,760
How can I avoid it

681
01:05:10,250 --> 01:05:12,250
There's two needle pine under here

682
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:14,250
Aching like crazy

683
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:18,060
Everyone calms down!

684
01:05:18,670 --> 01:05:22,380
This isn't the antidote

685
01:05:23,230 --> 01:05:25,230
But it'll temporarily stop the growing

686
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:27,350
Not letting them spread anymore

687
01:05:27,780 --> 01:05:29,390
Everyone's water is poisoned

688
01:05:29,510 --> 01:05:31,970
Infected with a thousand years old Demon's blood

689
01:05:32,510 --> 01:05:35,810
Once the demon is eliminated, your symptoms would disappear

690
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:39,950
But who would get rid of her?

691
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:42,050
My brother, "Ha Tuyết Phong Lôi"

692
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:44,740
The best Spirit Master

693
01:05:54,530 --> 01:05:55,670
"Hạ Tuyết Phong Lôi"

694
01:05:56,070 --> 01:05:57,850
I'll pay the debt between you and me

695
01:05:58,620 --> 01:06:00,150
How can you pay?

696
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:04,440
Cut off one of my hands, two hands if it's not enough

697
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:10,820
I know you want to go up "Black Mountain"\nI'll clear the way for you

698
01:06:11,110 --> 01:06:13,110
I don't mind death because of you

699
01:06:13,650 --> 01:06:14,620
Just look at yourself

700
01:06:14,990 --> 01:06:16,500
Pleading and begging, just because of one demon

701
01:06:17,770 --> 01:06:19,560
"Yến Xích Hà", you still won't change if you die

702
01:06:19,730 --> 01:06:21,550
I haven't changed?

703
01:06:21,690 --> 01:06:23,480
Don't I always keep watch over "Black Mountain"

704
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:25,520
You just keeping watch over her!

705
01:06:28,580 --> 01:06:30,030
"Yến Xích Hà"

706
01:06:30,670 --> 01:06:32,670
Who are you?

707
01:06:32,670 --> 01:06:34,670
What is there between you and me?

708
01:06:36,190 --> 01:06:38,880
I'm human, you're a demon

709
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,340
We got nothing between us two

710
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:48,050
You don't know him?

711
01:06:48,130 --> 01:06:51,200
He turned into his pathetic self because of you

712
01:06:52,730 --> 01:06:54,320
Now you say you don't know him?

713
01:06:55,110 --> 01:06:56,190
I'll let you know

714
01:06:58,350 --> 01:07:00,140
He's your lover

715
01:07:02,290 --> 01:07:03,710
Are you finished?

716
01:07:06,030 --> 01:07:06,860
That's impossible

717
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:09,640
You, you bastard is just

718
01:07:09,810 --> 01:07:12,030
Taking nonsense

719
01:07:12,170 --> 01:07:13,330
Tricking me

720
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:18,040
I'll bite you to death

721
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:21,930
Let me out

722
01:07:23,010 --> 01:07:24,620
I'll bite you to pieces

723
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:30,780
What are you looking at?

724
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:34,220
After I'm done with him, I'll get you

725
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:39,410
Hear that? Demons will always be demons

726
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:41,960
I know you already know this.

727
01:07:42,250 --> 01:07:46,470
No love, no mind, no heart no trust
That will never change

728
01:07:47,350 --> 01:07:50,390
Just like you, selling out your comrades, disrespecting our Masters

729
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:52,740
"Despised by humans, hated by demons"

730
01:07:53,310 --> 01:07:54,560
"Yến Xích Hà"

731
01:07:55,670 --> 01:07:58,020
What've you got in the end?

732
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:02,590
Honestly, I was gonna use your blood to wash my sword

733
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:05,710
Then use it to capture "Thụ Yêu"

734
01:08:06,390 --> 01:08:08,010
But now I've changed my mind

735
01:08:08,630 --> 01:08:11,050
A useless person like you, even demons despise you

736
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:13,320
Killing you just make my sword dirty

737
01:08:14,310 --> 01:08:16,010
You really like her huh?

738
01:08:17,310 --> 01:08:19,310
I'll let you watch her...

739
01:08:19,590 --> 01:08:21,260
Burn to ashes

740
01:08:55,340 --> 01:08:57,240
I wanna eat it forever

741
01:10:19,670 --> 01:10:21,660
Brother, let me go too

742
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:23,950
- No.
- I can help you

743
01:10:24,290 --> 01:10:25,770
Help me collect body right??

744
01:10:28,170 --> 01:10:30,170
Honestly, there won't be bodies to collect

745
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:34,570
After I destroy "Lan Nhược Tự",
I'll die with "Thụ Yêu"

746
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:36,580
That's the best ending

747
01:10:45,660 --> 01:10:47,190
When I joined I've already said

748
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:52,700
"Shed blood but don't shed tears"

749
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:57,440
Spirit Masters cannot be too emotional

750
01:10:58,090 --> 01:11:00,020
If not mistakes would be made

751
01:11:01,750 --> 01:11:04,980
Like "Yến Xích Hà",
You just hurt yourself in the end

752
01:11:16,250 --> 01:11:17,870
I understand, brother

753
01:11:19,820 --> 01:11:20,680
"Tiểu Thiến"

754
01:11:21,980 --> 01:11:22,490
"Tiểu Thiến"

755
01:11:24,790 --> 01:11:26,790
"Thiết Nha", Is "Thiến" in there?

756
01:11:26,790 --> 01:11:28,790
There's no "Thiến" here, only demons..get lost!

757
01:11:29,130 --> 01:11:30,010
Go!

758
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:33,030
-"Tiểu Thiến"! - Go away!

759
01:11:36,270 --> 01:11:38,670
Let...let me go

760
01:11:39,140 --> 01:11:41,140
Don't copy what I say

761
01:11:41,140 --> 01:11:42,840
I'm here to look for "Tiểu Thiến"

762
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:44,450
Keep dreaming!

763
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:56,740
You know she's a demon and still save her?

764
01:11:57,050 --> 01:11:59,120
I don't care . I must save her

765
01:11:59,490 --> 01:12:00,120
You can't go

766
01:12:04,930 --> 01:12:06,130
Sorry

767
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:11,750
"Tiểu Thiến"

768
01:12:17,910 --> 01:12:19,100
Let me down first

769
01:12:19,300 --> 01:12:19,980
"Tiểu Thiến"...

770
01:12:23,250 --> 01:12:24,520
"Ninh"

771
01:12:24,830 --> 01:12:26,990
I must get you out

772
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:33,320
What are you doing?

773
01:12:33,790 --> 01:12:35,790
You make one wrong move,
"Tiểu Thiến" will burn to a crisp

774
01:12:36,490 --> 01:12:38,030
Let me down first

775
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:41,150
No, you will capture "Tiểu Thiến"

776
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:43,500
I can't free you

777
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:47,050
Idiot! You don't understand this trap

778
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:50,540
Can't be wasting time, If all the coins fall

779
01:12:50,940 --> 01:12:52,530
"Tiểu Thiến" will be destroyed

780
01:12:52,890 --> 01:12:54,260
Let me down

781
01:12:54,710 --> 01:12:55,850
Hurry

782
01:13:06,460 --> 01:13:07,480
Quickly

783
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:19,230
"Tiểu Thiến"

784
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:24,760
Why must you and my brother fight?

785
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:28,220
Why don't you guys use your skills to fight "Thụ Yêu"?

786
01:13:28,950 --> 01:13:32,220
If "Thụ Yêu" is not destroyed, catastrophe will come

787
01:13:32,590 --> 01:13:35,000
This village won't have a tomorrow

788
01:13:36,220 --> 01:13:38,010
I can let this demon live

789
01:13:38,690 --> 01:13:43,030
"Yến Xích Hà",
will you save the innocent villagers?

790
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:51,600
Must get to "Lan Nhược Tự" before dark\nHurry!

791
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:00,310
You're really going up the mountain?

792
01:14:01,820 --> 01:14:03,820
You need to know clearly that "Lan Nhược Tự"

793
01:14:03,860 --> 01:14:05,450
Has thousand years old "Thụ Yêu"

794
01:14:05,730 --> 01:14:07,450
2 deadly poison "Snake Demon"

795
01:14:07,630 --> 01:14:09,860
And many other demons

796
01:14:11,290 --> 01:14:13,880
Don't say any more, I'm really scared

797
01:14:18,330 --> 01:14:20,860
But because "Tiểu Thiến" is still there

798
01:14:22,110 --> 01:14:23,210
I have to get it

799
01:14:46,390 --> 01:14:47,470
"Ninh"

800
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:49,010
Don't worry about me

801
01:14:56,300 --> 01:14:57,890
As long as we have your "Spirit"

802
01:14:57,940 --> 01:15:00,610
You can escape "Thụ Yêu",
she won't be able to control you any more

803
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:03,080
I'll die with no regrets

804
01:16:46,010 --> 01:16:48,010
Thinking back when I got sealed

805
01:16:48,750 --> 01:16:51,730
The last I saw...is you!

806
01:16:53,820 --> 01:16:55,820
Today, now that I'm free

807
01:16:56,660 --> 01:16:58,660
First thing I saw...

808
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:00,670
Is you again!

809
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:04,100
I didn't think time flies that fast

810
01:17:04,580 --> 01:17:05,560
The thing is...

811
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:08,410
You're now old

812
01:17:10,370 --> 01:17:12,470
Not as old as your thousands year demon!

813
01:17:12,980 --> 01:17:15,990
You forgot my name is "Mộc Cơ" ?

814
01:17:21,350 --> 01:17:23,990
I've always wishes that

815
01:17:24,390 --> 01:17:28,100
I can rip your heart and drink your blood

816
01:17:43,900 --> 01:17:45,900
I can't believe you're that good to me

817
01:17:47,670 --> 01:17:49,670
Taking yourself here

818
01:17:52,310 --> 01:17:54,520
I really want to see how you die!

819
01:18:12,170 --> 01:18:14,040
So stank! What is it?

820
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:16,400
My virgin urine

821
01:18:16,770 --> 01:18:17,850
You still "got" it?

822
01:18:18,370 --> 01:18:20,990
Still a virgin after these years, Tastes good right?

823
01:18:25,170 --> 01:18:25,960
Brother

824
01:18:32,660 --> 01:18:34,950
That's why I adore you so much

825
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:38,050
Bringing both your old and new love

826
01:19:19,650 --> 01:19:22,200
You traitor will never escape "Lan Nhược Tự"!

827
01:19:52,300 --> 01:19:53,840
"Ninh Thái Thần", go open the water pond

828
01:19:53,980 --> 01:19:55,460
You'll find "Tiểu Thiến" spirit

829
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:00,900
Heaven's eyes

830
01:20:16,540 --> 01:20:18,240
"Lâm Binh Đấu Giả! Trận Liệt Tại Tiền!" (magic chant)

831
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:27,200
"Ninh Thái Thần", quickly

832
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:31,200
Hurry! I can't hold any more

833
01:21:00,260 --> 01:21:01,260
Hurry up!

834
01:21:20,990 --> 01:21:22,450

Are you heartbroken "Yến Xích Hà"?

836
01:21:50,350 --> 01:21:53,180
"Tiểu Thiến" is a part of me

837
01:21:54,010 --> 01:21:56,220
If I die, she'll die with me!

838
01:22:11,470 --> 01:22:13,470

844
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:24,850

845
01:24:50,300 --> 01:24:51,800
You demon!

846
01:24:56,460 --> 01:24:57,900
"Yến Xích Hà"!

847
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:09,880
"Tiểu Thiến"

848
01:25:20,490 --> 01:25:21,820
You are "Tiểu Thiến"?

849
01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:33,100
Come here, come with me

850
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:46,310
Sugar candy

851
01:26:05,550 --> 01:26:07,110
I'll take you out of here

852
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:25,360
You're heartbroken right?

853
01:26:29,030 --> 01:26:30,550
I despise you Old Demon!

854
01:26:31,850 --> 01:26:33,330
Calling me old?

855
01:26:33,870 --> 01:26:35,870
Better than someone who can't turn old!

856
01:26:40,570 --> 01:26:42,570
You really want to leave?

857
01:26:42,570 --> 01:26:45,530
I'll let your man see you off, alright?

858
01:26:47,430 --> 01:26:49,840
I want his own hands to kill his woman!

859
01:27:06,170 --> 01:27:07,580
You demon

860
01:27:12,170 --> 01:27:13,450
"Tiểu Thiến"

861
01:27:13,670 --> 01:27:14,760

864
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:47,590
"Yến Xích Hà"

865
01:27:47,590 --> 01:27:48,640
It's candy

866
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:51,300
Then go head and kill me

867
01:28:07,310 --> 01:28:09,970
You demon,
You and I will die together

868
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:36,480
"Yến Xích Hà"

869
01:29:05,250 --> 01:29:06,840
Sorry

I let you remember me

871
01:29:29,510 --> 01:29:31,510
If you can choose again

872
01:29:32,260 --> 01:29:35,040
Would you still make me forget about you?

873
01:29:54,900 --> 01:29:56,580
I understand

874
01:30:11,150 --> 01:30:12,720
Hurry and get out!

875
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:17,690
"Lan Nhược Tự" is created with "Thụ Yêu" magic

876
01:30:17,830 --> 01:30:19,880
When "Thụ Yêu" is destroy, it'll crumble

877
01:30:22,770 --> 01:30:24,330
"Ninh Thái Thần"

878
01:30:24,760 --> 01:30:26,860
Take "Tiểu Thiến" out of "Lan Nhược Tự"

879
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:13,160
Lets go

"Ninh"

884
01:31:50,110 --> 01:31:51,530
I won't go

885
01:31:52,620 --> 01:31:54,620
"Yến Xích Hà" is right

886
01:31:55,190 --> 01:31:57,680
We cannot be together

887
01:31:57,830 --> 01:32:00,210
But I've found your fox spirit

888
01:32:03,270 --> 01:32:05,090
Even if I leave here

889
01:32:05,910 --> 01:32:07,590
I'm still a demon

890
01:32:10,100 --> 01:32:14,080
Let me and my spirit die here at "Lan Nhược Tự."

891
01:32:15,340 --> 01:32:18,030
Who knows, may be fate will bring us together again one day

892
01:32:18,710 --> 01:32:20,020
By then

893
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:22,770
May be I'm not a demon any more

894
01:32:24,730 --> 01:32:26,340
Free it

895
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:30,370
Then I won't go, I'll stay\nWe'll die together

896
01:32:31,650 --> 01:32:34,430
You have to go,
"Lan Nhược Tự" is about to be destroyed

897
01:32:37,430 --> 01:32:39,430
I can't let go

898
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:42,200
I can't

899
01:32:49,300 --> 01:32:51,810
You want to sacrifice because of me?

900
01:33:04,790 --> 01:33:06,270
I know that

901
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:15,800
"Tiểu Thiến"!

902
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:35,410
What is this? It's tasty

903
01:33:35,550 --> 01:33:36,830
Sugar candy

904
01:33:38,100 --> 01:33:40,560
Then I'll fall in love with whoever treats me them

905
01:34:28,160 --> 01:34:30,850
Human and spirit cannot live together

906
01:34:31,080 --> 01:34:33,070
You must snap out of it

907
01:34:35,080 --> 01:34:38,430
It's all "a moon's reflection, illusions and smokes"

908
01:34:39,220 --> 01:34:40,220
"Tiểu Thiến"

909
01:35:05,650 --> 01:35:08,170
Saviors, on behalf of "Black Mountain" villagers

910
01:35:09,330 --> 01:35:10,040
Thank you so much

911
01:35:15,390 --> 01:35:20,000
Our..our "tree"\nWould it grow back?

912
01:35:20,250 --> 01:35:22,000
Peep it and see

913
01:35:24,420 --> 01:35:27,830
Right, our village haven't got this many trees in a long time

914
01:35:28,770 --> 01:35:32,480
Savior, please stop why when you're free

915
