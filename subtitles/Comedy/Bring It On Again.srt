00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:03,706
Are we allowed
to be in here?

300
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:06,642
2:00 a.m.'s
the only good time to swim.

301
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:09,408
The rest of the time,
I'm working.
Where?

302
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:13,178
Well, I do work-study
in the cafeteria.

303
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:15,812
Part-time in an audio store.
Full-time as a student.

304
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:17,856
And the rest of the time
as a mix-master.

305
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:21,290
What's a mix-master?
It's a turn-tablist.

306
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,692
What's a turn-tablist?
It's a D.J.

307
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:27,391
I knew that.
[Both Laughing]

308

Oh, hey. I'm not into you
like that. L...

No, I didn't... l...

[Both Laughing]

311
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:50,488
Well, then I'm leaving.
I'm out.
Okay. Fine. Fine.

312
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:55,493
It's over.
Okay. Well, okay...
[Laughs]

313
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:58,359
Why do you work so much?
I work so much...

314
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:01,490
because my dad
wouldn't pay my tuition
unless I declared premed.

315
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:05,264
And you didn't want
to be a doctor, so...
So, I work.

316
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:12,008
Well, you know what they say
about men who work too hard.

317
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:16,878
They become
tired, boring...

318
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:20,578
and in the process they lose
all their spontaneity.

319
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,862
Derek, are you tired?

320
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:34,695
No. You're boring!
[Giggling]

<i>You are boring.</i>

Boring, my ass!
[Squeals]

Whoo!
[Laughs]

God, you look great
under water.

325
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:02,720
Well, did I tell you
I'm a cheerleader?

326
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:05,319
[Laughs] Yeah.
I think we covered that.

327
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:09,527
Did we talk about
your 10,000 part-time jobs?

328
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:11,762
Yeah.
I think a while back.

329
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,804
Oh.

330
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,002
Well, was there anything else
that we needed to cover?

331
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:22,103
Well, there was...

332
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:25,308
one thing I wanted to...

333
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:32,881
[Whimpers]

334
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,387
I gotta go.
Wait, wait, wait.

335
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,521
Don't you
want to stay and,

336
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:42,123
you know, swim
a little more?

337
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,600
I think my roommate might be
getting worried about me.

338
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:47,194
Why would she be worried?

339
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,604
Because,

340
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:52,872
you're turning me
into a criminal.

341
00:21:55,547 --> 00:22:00,109
Whit... Whittier,
I could get hypothermia
without you here!

Thank you.

damage control

350

<i>Greg.! How about
the happy cheer face now, huh?</i>

352
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,516
This is my happy cheer face.

353
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,558
That's not
a happy smile!

354
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,559
That's a hate smile.

Was that a simple pop-off?

Missy, you are no longer
an individual.

All right?
You are a very small,
little minute part...

390
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:35,836
of a very big-ass machine!

<i>Shut the door.</i>

398
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:14,037
Did you know that, um,

399
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:18,208
- George W. Bush was
a cheerleader in college?
- Actually, I did.

400
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:21,741
Ronald Reagan was
also a cheerleader.
So was Dwight D. Eisenhower.

401
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:25,756
The three greatest presidents
of the last 200 years...

402
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:29,487
- all cheerleaders.
- Was Ronald Reagan really
one of the top three?

403
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:32,086
Top 40.
My point is this.

404
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:34,495
From great cheerleaders
come even greater leaders.

405

<i>You may be a great cheerleader,
Whittier, but you are not
a great leader.</i>

I know,
and I'm really trying hard.

See these portraits
on the wall?

408
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:49,340
A 98-year tradition
of cheerleading excellence
at CSC.

409
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:55,046
Starting back with
the remarkable Margaret Whiting
in 1938.

410
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,645
What's she doing?
An arabesque.

411

<i>You can't tell
under the hoopskirt.</i>

412
00:26:00,825 --> 00:26:05,353
All the way up to the fantastic
Hammersmith dynasty of today.

413
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:08,092
These are your sisters?
Yep.

414
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:11,499
They're all part
of a grand legacy
with no end in sight.

415
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:13,730
That last empty frame
right there is reserved...

<i>for the head cheerleader

our next leader.
Marni.

418
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:21,412
It could be Marni.
[Chuckles]

419
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:23,413
Or it could be Greg.
Whoo.

420
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:25,415
Or as I've been
thinking lately,

421
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:28,748
- it could be you.
- Yeah, right.

422
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:32,950
- I'm serious, Whittier.
- But I completely
messed up in practice.

423
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:35,891
I thought you called me in here
to kick me off the team.

424
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:38,589
Oh, I haven't
totally ruled that out yet.

425
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:42,827
<i>I don't know.
I just expect more out of you
than the others.</i>

426
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:44,926
Certainly more than
your friend, Monica.

427
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:48,472
Monica was just messing around.
Wait till game day.
She'll be perfect.

428
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,703
Oh, really? She's gonna
be great on game day?
Monica is a sinking ship!

429
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:55,143
<i>To be a great cheerleader
you have to make sacrifices.</i>

430
00:26:55,213 --> 00:26:57,681
And I suggest
you start with her.

431
00:26:57,749 --> 00:27:00,684
Do you mean
not being friends with her?

432
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:03,721
<i>'Cause we're roommates.
Listen, sweetie.</i>

433
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,847
Being head cheerleader...

434
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:09,382
is a privilege you should
very much want.

435
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,486
I mean,
[Chuckles]

436
00:27:11,563 --> 00:27:15,124
Students have posters
of me on their walls.

437
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,327
They pay hundreds of dollars...

438
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:20,370
320 to be exact...
just to get my number.

439
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:23,100
They raffle off the right
to carry my books to class.
[Laughs]

440
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:25,472
[Chuckling]
It's so silly.

441
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:28,103
Foreign exchange students
literally...

442
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:32,081
beg to do my homework...
straight A's.

443
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:35,847
All this could be yours.
You could be the greatest thing
on this campus...

444
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,718
the next me.
[Chuckles]

445
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,953
- Whoa.
- But I don't know.

446
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:44,552

you're gonna have to shine

Actually... and, ladies,
please keep this a secret,

457
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:30,403
Tina told me that
if I work really hard...

458
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:33,205
and I play my cards right,

459
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:37,578
I could become
head cheerleader.

- Yeah, that's great!

No. I don't want
to be head cheerleader.

on J. Lo's next tour.

463
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:50,955
I've been meaning
to talk to you about that.
What?

464
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:53,862
Tina made a lot of sense
in practice the other day.

465
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:58,266
There is a big difference
between individual dance moves
and... Oh, my gosh!

466
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:00,860
What?

467

in that. Not to mention
35 grams of saturated fat.

and Tina is the bomb diggity!
