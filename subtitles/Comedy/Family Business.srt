1
00:02:38,729 --> 00:02:41,250
$24 for a cab ride to the Bronx.
I can't believe it.

2
00:02:41,417 --> 00:02:45,891
Come to my parents' for Passover
once a year without complaining, Vito.

3
00:02:52,651 --> 00:02:55,018
Wait a minute, honey, let me help you.

4
00:02:55,371 --> 00:02:57,345
- Will Adam be here?
- I don't know...

5
00:02:57,514 --> 00:02:59,751
...but if he is, be nice.
It's a Seder, okay?

6
00:02:59,915 --> 00:03:02,119
Don't worry, don't worry.

7
00:03:04,235 --> 00:03:06,210
- Hi, Mom.
- Hello, darling.

8
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:08,452
- Adam. Hi, darling.
- Hi.

9
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,246
Come a little late like always.

10
00:03:10,411 --> 00:03:13,030
Papa, hello, darling.

11
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,555
Traffic. There are so many Jews
headed for Seder, Mama.

12
00:03:16,716 --> 00:03:18,407
- Good day, sir.
- Hiya, Nat.

13
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,613
I thought people were
cutting down on meat.

14
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,399
How come the material
gets more expensive every year?

15
00:03:23,565 --> 00:03:25,256
Please, don't worry yourself.

16
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:28,104
I know the face, now.
The face... The face looks familiar.

17
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:31,881
- Hey, Pop.
- Adam, how are you?

18
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:35,112
Hey, who'd you get this year?
I got Bernard Karlinski.

19
00:03:35,277 --> 00:03:40,013
Let me see here.
"The bar mitzvah of Owen Zuckerbrot."

20
00:03:40,174 --> 00:03:41,603
Nat, Owen Zuckerbrot?

21
00:03:41,774 --> 00:03:44,741
He brings the yarmulkes home
from shul. You know, the extras.

22
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,398
You want it to say
"Vito McMullen," you have to convert.

23
00:03:47,567 --> 00:03:50,665
- Why not?
- Not yet.

24
00:04:09,712 --> 00:04:14,414
Did you see how Adam remembers
his Hebrew? With a mind like that.

25
00:04:14,576 --> 00:04:15,951
- Ma.
- What did I say?

26
00:04:16,113 --> 00:04:18,502
It's a shande to me that
a boy with such a head...

27
00:04:18,673 --> 00:04:21,869
...drops out of school six months
before a master's degree.

28
00:04:22,033 --> 00:04:24,586
- Drops out? Drops out of school?
- Six months before.

29
00:04:24,753 --> 00:04:26,215
- Three months.
- Can we drop it?

30
00:04:26,386 --> 00:04:29,866
We're not allowed to ask? You're back
since January. I haven't seen you.

31
00:04:30,033 --> 00:04:32,684
- I came here for a Seder.
- Adam looks marvelous.

32
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:34,858
- We're glad you're here.
- He's become a man.

33
00:04:35,026 --> 00:04:38,223
- Look how beautifully he eats.
- Ma, please. He's gonna be 23.

34
00:04:38,386 --> 00:04:41,201
Stop bragging about how he gets
all the food in his mouth.

35
00:04:41,362 --> 00:04:43,916
- You try to kvell over your grandson.
- I won't complain.

36
00:04:44,082 --> 00:04:45,839
- After 24 years, it's still rough.
- 23.

37
00:04:46,003 --> 00:04:48,720
Forgot the year your goy son-in-law
wasn't allowed up here.

38
00:04:48,883 --> 00:04:51,730
- Time to let the angel in.
- Nat, how come the angel...

39
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:55,667
...gets a bigger glass?
- Your material is getting stale.

40
00:04:55,859 --> 00:04:58,031
Better leave the chain on.
This is the Bronx.

41
00:04:58,196 --> 00:05:01,393
Instead of Elijah, some mugger
is gonna charge through the door.

42
00:05:01,556 --> 00:05:03,563
- Adam's right.
- When you two gonna move out?

43
00:05:03,732 --> 00:05:06,482
- You're too old to survive here.
- How old are you, Grandpa?

44
00:05:06,645 --> 00:05:10,442
- Nobody kept records. No one knows.
- They'll never tell. Crazy superstition.

45
00:05:10,612 --> 00:05:15,915
Not so crazy. You don't tempt God
by bragging about your age. Sit.

46
00:05:16,085 --> 00:05:18,933
Forty-two years here,
the neighborhood is not so bad.

47
00:05:19,126 --> 00:05:22,770
Then why can't I drive my
Cadillac to your Seder? Nat...

48
00:05:22,933 --> 00:05:25,617
...there are places in Flushing.
If it's a matter of money...

49
00:05:25,782 --> 00:05:28,171
...I can chip in a few bucks.
- They wanna be the last.

50
00:05:28,342 --> 00:05:30,644
We'll chisel it on your stone
after the mugging.

51
00:05:30,838 --> 00:05:33,424
"Nat and Rose Gruden, last Jews
on Davidson Avenue."

52
00:05:33,591 --> 00:05:35,730
Gruden residence.

53
00:05:37,719 --> 00:05:39,629
Hi, Jessie.

54
00:05:43,736 --> 00:05:46,070
Well, what time do you think
you'll be out?

55
00:05:47,032 --> 00:05:49,137
Okay, no problem.

56
00:05:49,463 --> 00:05:54,385
Yeah, don't worry about it.
All right. Take care, Jessie.

57
00:05:56,473 --> 00:05:59,768
- Your grandfather?
- What was that about, Adam?

58
00:05:59,928 --> 00:06:03,190
Jessie wanted to wish us
a happy Passover.

59
00:06:03,353 --> 00:06:06,834
- Vito, your father knows our number?
- Yeah, how come?

60
00:06:07,001 --> 00:06:09,816
Well, the unexpected.
Jessie doesn't change, huh?

61
00:06:09,977 --> 00:06:12,017
No, he sure doesn't.

62
00:06:18,394 --> 00:06:19,343
Take care, Nat.

63
00:06:19,514 --> 00:06:22,232
Vito, see if you can get a cab,
I'll be right out.

64
00:06:22,395 --> 00:06:25,810
- So when are you moving, Grandma?
- We don't take from our children.

65
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:28,313
You're like a couple of turkeys
in these streets.

66
00:06:28,474 --> 00:06:29,881
This neighborhood's a jungle.

67
00:06:30,043 --> 00:06:33,556
I'm not coming to the next Seder
unless you're living somewhere else.

68
00:06:33,723 --> 00:06:35,927
Did you hear what your grandson said?

69
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,827
Well, what did he want?

70
00:06:40,988 --> 00:06:42,995
Jessie wanted to wish us
a happy Passover.

71
00:06:43,164 --> 00:06:45,815
Come on, Adam, stop the crap.

72
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,951
Your old man needs bail money.
I'm gonna go down there.

73
00:06:49,116 --> 00:06:51,931
- And he calls you.
- Yeah.

74
00:06:52,572 --> 00:06:56,915
You been talking to my father while you
been ducking me since you got back?

75
00:06:57,469 --> 00:06:59,859
All right. Is it serious?

76
00:07:00,029 --> 00:07:02,615
It's a bar fight. But it's
an off-duty cop he whacked.

77
00:07:02,781 --> 00:07:04,854
He whacked a cop?

78
00:07:05,182 --> 00:07:06,359
Is the guy hurt?

79
00:07:06,525 --> 00:07:09,111
Well, Grandpa says he
"kicked the bull's ass...

80
00:07:09,278 --> 00:07:11,766
...the length of the bar
and halfway down 10th Ave."

81
00:07:11,934 --> 00:07:15,250
When is he gonna let up?
Oh, Christ.

82
00:07:15,422 --> 00:07:19,197
Well, what the hell, it's nice
to know I have strong genes.

83
00:07:19,358 --> 00:07:21,747
Hope I'm getting pinched
for bar fights in my 60s.

84
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,887
Just remember, Adam,
along with those strong genes...

85
00:07:25,055 --> 00:07:27,903
...my father passes on a lot
of other crap to go with it.

86
00:07:28,063 --> 00:07:30,714
- So stay away from him.
- He's not looking to hurt me.

87
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:33,847
No, he's not, but it'll happen anyway.

88
00:07:34,015 --> 00:07:37,114
He'll spend the night in the can.
Fine with me.

89
00:07:38,848 --> 00:07:41,150
- Lend me $800.
- Forget it.

90
00:07:41,312 --> 00:07:44,608
I stood bail for him three years ago.
I haven't heard from him since.

91
00:07:44,768 --> 00:07:47,900
- I don't stand bail for Jessie anymore.
- You're not.

92
00:07:48,065 --> 00:07:52,221
I'm borrowing the money.
I've got $200, I'd like 800 more.

93
00:07:52,385 --> 00:07:54,939
- So it's for you?
- Right.

94
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:06,330
Adam, the last year
my mother was alive...

95
00:08:07,106 --> 00:08:08,961
...I was 7 years old. Okay?

96
00:08:09,123 --> 00:08:12,352
Jessie took me along Christmas Eve
to buy a tree, right?

97
00:08:12,514 --> 00:08:15,581
Near midnight we're passing an
Esso station up near Riverdale...

98
00:08:15,747 --> 00:08:19,871
...and right on top of the garage is
a perfect, all lit-up Christmas tree.

99
00:08:20,036 --> 00:08:24,738
So Jessie hits the brakes and he says,
"Wow, what a score, it's even got lights."

100
00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:26,176
Wait a minute.

101
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:30,234
I'm standing lookout, I was 7 years old,
while he climbs up the drainpipe...

102
00:08:30,404 --> 00:08:32,793
...and pulls down the tree,
lights and all.

103
00:08:33,188 --> 00:08:36,385
What's so funny?
I got a dozen stories like that.

104
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:40,826
Like helping him rob Lionel trains
out of Macy's when I was 12 years old.

105
00:08:40,997 --> 00:08:43,812
He's working there, I had to cut school
because he decided...

106
00:08:43,973 --> 00:08:47,105
...to take a box of engines out.
Thought he'd get money for it.

107
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:50,947
- What happened?
- It doesn't matter what happened.

108
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:55,747
- Just know who you're dealing with.
- All right, all right.

109
00:08:59,591 --> 00:09:02,787
- That's eight.
- Thanks.

110
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:07,715
That was nice what you did
in there for them.

111
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:10,018
Might get out of this cesspool
because of you.

112
00:09:10,343 --> 00:09:12,067
Well, I had them over a barrel.

113
00:09:12,232 --> 00:09:16,575
Somebody loves you, you got a hell of
a weapon in the relationship, you know?

114
00:09:18,888 --> 00:09:20,514
Hey.

115
00:09:22,441 --> 00:09:25,026
Listen, it's supposed
to work both ways, kiddo.

116
00:09:25,192 --> 00:09:28,509
I mean, if you love somebody back,
then they got an equal weapon, no?

117
00:09:28,681 --> 00:09:30,590
You're right.
I guess we got a standoff.

118
00:09:30,761 --> 00:09:33,631
- I guess we do.
- They may move. I think you did it.

119
00:09:33,801 --> 00:09:35,263
- I better get a cab.
- Good.

120
00:09:35,433 --> 00:09:39,361
- How about dinner next week?
- Sure. What time should we be there?

121
00:09:39,529 --> 00:09:42,464
- You did want Christine, no?
- Of course, Adam.

122
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:45,961
You know Christine's always welcome.
You wanna catch a ride with us?

123
00:09:46,122 --> 00:09:48,610
- No, thanks.
- Okay, good night, Adam.

124
00:09:48,778 --> 00:09:51,208
- Bye, sweetheart.
- Why doesn't he wanna ride with us?

125
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:56,105
Docket number 178649325.

126
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:06,281
The charge is second-degree
assault, Your Honor.

127
00:10:06,444 --> 00:10:10,634
At 6 p. m. yesterday, in a bar and grill
at 50210th Avenue...

128
00:10:10,796 --> 00:10:14,659
...Mr. McMullen assaulted
an off-duty policeman.

129
00:10:14,828 --> 00:10:19,586
Well, I'd love to hear about this
in your own words, Mr. McMullen.

130
00:10:20,364 --> 00:10:24,161
Your Honor, I'm a victim
of police brutality.

131
00:10:24,365 --> 00:10:27,234
Just tell us what occurred,
Mr. McMullen.

132
00:10:27,405 --> 00:10:31,399
Well, it all happened so fast,
Your Honor.

133
00:10:31,566 --> 00:10:33,638
I'll try to remember.

134
00:10:33,805 --> 00:10:38,508
We had an argument. To be fair about it,
I was as much at fault as he was.

135
00:10:39,855 --> 00:10:42,953
Well, one thing led to another
and somehow it comes out...

136
00:10:43,118 --> 00:10:45,769
...that my mother was
a Native American...

137
00:10:45,934 --> 00:10:48,488
...a full-blooded Cherokee,
Your Honor.

138
00:10:48,687 --> 00:10:54,732
And this policeman yells, "It's too bad
Custer made such a half-ass job of it."

139
00:10:54,895 --> 00:10:58,027
- Well, I lost control.
- What did you do?

140
00:10:58,223 --> 00:11:01,191
I did what little I could
for a man my age.

141
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,037
The little Mr. McMullen was able to do
seems to have been pretty effective.

142
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,062
The officer has taken 18 stitches
in his face, his nose is broken...

143
00:11:09,232 --> 00:11:10,607
...and his jaw is wired up.

144
00:11:11,248 --> 00:11:15,526
I must've hit him harder than I knew.
Fright, fear, whatever it was, Your Honor.

145
00:11:15,697 --> 00:11:18,763
Your Honor, here is the BCI
on Mr. Jessie McMullen.

146
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:24,843
It begins in 1947 with a three-year term
for assault just after he was naturalized.

147
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:27,431
It goes on and on and on and...

148
00:11:27,602 --> 00:11:31,792
Your Honor, before the prosecutor
sentences my client...

149
00:11:31,954 --> 00:11:34,769
...perhaps he will agree to a trial?

150
00:11:34,931 --> 00:11:37,036
We're only here to set bail.

151
00:11:37,203 --> 00:11:40,586
I'd like to point out that the defendant's
grandson is present in court.

152
00:11:40,754 --> 00:11:42,795
My client has roots in this community.

153
00:11:43,635 --> 00:11:49,647
Bail is set at $5000.
A $500 cash bail bond is acceptable.

154
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,365
Next.

155
00:11:52,531 --> 00:11:56,493
Docket number 178649326.

156
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,930
Did you bring the 500?

157
00:12:00,404 --> 00:12:01,964
You don't travel light, I see.

158
00:12:02,132 --> 00:12:04,554
Vito gave me 800.
Good thing he had the cash.

159
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:08,041
Your father's always got a few grand
swag money in his pocket.

160
00:12:08,213 --> 00:12:10,220
He robs the tax collector,
your father.

161
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:13,935
It's never been easy for me
having a thief in the family.

162
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:17,811
You've grown, Adam.
It's been a long time.

163
00:12:22,006 --> 00:12:25,355
- Money.
- Oh, money.

164
00:12:31,703 --> 00:12:34,550
Look at this. It's become a shithouse.

165
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,336
Never been in a jail before.

166
00:12:36,503 --> 00:12:40,398
You haven't missed a lot. It's got some
good points too, when you're young.

167
00:12:40,568 --> 00:12:42,477
- Like what?
- It helps build character...

168
00:12:42,647 --> 00:12:44,557
...like a hitch in the Army.

169
00:12:44,792 --> 00:12:47,541
A wallet. A watch.
A handkerchief, pure silk.

170
00:12:47,704 --> 00:12:53,105
Not to mention $270,000.
I'm just kidding. $270.

171
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,865
- Hey, Jessie.
- Hi, John.

172
00:12:55,032 --> 00:12:59,189
- This place keeps going downhill.
- Yeah, just like the rest of the city.

173
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:05,686
You're looking good, Adam. These fancy
schools must be agreeing with you.

174
00:13:05,849 --> 00:13:09,232
MIT's not fancy.
And they don't, Jessie.

175
00:13:09,402 --> 00:13:12,151
They really don't agree with me at all.

176
00:13:12,313 --> 00:13:15,347
Last night in the bar,
did that cop land the first punch?

177
00:13:15,514 --> 00:13:17,653
Adam, I've never been
in a bar fight yet...

178
00:13:17,818 --> 00:13:22,674
...where the other guy landed the first
punch. It's a sure recipe for losing.

179
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:27,258
- So when did you get back in town?
- I left school in January.

180
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:30,615
I was this far away from getting
my master's in molecular biology.

181
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:34,576
- And your old man's paying for all this?
- No way. I'm on full scholarship.

182
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:36,689
I was a Westinghouse Scholar.

183
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:39,828
It's a big deal.
They only have six each year.

184
00:13:39,995 --> 00:13:43,574
I hated it. It felt worse than that cell.

185
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,490
They've got your whole life
mapped out for you.

186
00:13:46,653 --> 00:13:49,468
You don't know the half of it.
I would have had my own lab...

187
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:53,044
...terrific salary, the works.

188
00:13:53,597 --> 00:13:56,913
They were already talking to me
about a retirement plan.

189
00:13:57,949 --> 00:14:02,739
I've been living with a girl
up on 23rd Street. An older girl.

190
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:07,100
Nothing wrong with an older woman.
For a young man.

191
00:14:08,606 --> 00:14:12,567
My mother's okay. Vito tries,
but he makes me feel guilty.

192
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:16,510
- Your father can be pretty good at that.
- Hey, Jess.

193
00:14:16,671 --> 00:14:19,803
Hi, Phil. Say hello to Adam,
my grandson.

194
00:14:19,967 --> 00:14:21,341
- Vito's boy.
- Hi, Phil.

195
00:14:21,503 --> 00:14:24,569
I remember you. What've you
been doing with yourself lately?

196
00:14:25,119 --> 00:14:26,297
Finding myself.

197
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,273
Well, I hope you've been
getting laid in the process.

198
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,262
- What do you got?
- Ferragamos.

199
00:14:31,424 --> 00:14:34,686
300 a pair all along Madison Avenue,
fell off a truck this morning.

200
00:14:34,848 --> 00:14:37,718
- Fifty dollars a pair. 13C?
- Right.

201
00:14:37,889 --> 00:14:40,638
- You got it.
- What do you take?

202
00:14:42,881 --> 00:14:46,176
- 91 I2C.
- No problem.

203
00:14:49,474 --> 00:14:50,652
- There you go.
- Thanks.

204
00:14:50,817 --> 00:14:52,606
Say hello to your father for me.

205
00:14:52,769 --> 00:14:56,730
Me and him used to cut a lot of corners
when we were kids. Take it easy.

206
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:01,560
Not in the bar, bad luck.
You can get trees for them.

207
00:15:04,482 --> 00:15:06,871
You're a class act, Jessie.

208
00:15:07,043 --> 00:15:11,233
I still remember those stretch limos
out to Shea when I was 12.

209
00:15:11,651 --> 00:15:14,685
Yeah, the driver was working off
a gambling debt.

210
00:15:14,851 --> 00:15:17,306
It was a wonderful way to travel, no?

211
00:15:17,475 --> 00:15:19,101
Cheers.

212
00:15:21,763 --> 00:15:26,750
Those piers used to hum.
Half the West Side worked on the docks.

213
00:15:26,917 --> 00:15:28,957
The pickings were great.

214
00:15:29,124 --> 00:15:32,540
That's where I landed, right over there.

215
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:36,096
- September '46.
- My grandmother?

216
00:15:36,261 --> 00:15:38,017
Yeah.

217
00:15:38,181 --> 00:15:39,970
Those happy years for the two of you?

218
00:15:40,133 --> 00:15:44,476
Happy? Married to a Sicilian?
Happiness is against their nature.

219
00:15:44,646 --> 00:15:49,119
She spent every waking hour cooking
pasta. She had me pissing olive oil.

220
00:15:49,286 --> 00:15:51,555
You be careful,
you got some of that blood.

221
00:15:51,718 --> 00:15:55,581
Try to encourage
the Scottish genes, Adam.

222
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,882
Wonder how Vito would've turned out
if you'd married somebody Scottish.

223
00:15:59,047 --> 00:16:02,462
He'd have had a proper first name,
for a start. Instead of Vito.

224
00:16:02,631 --> 00:16:05,533
And he'd have been at least
five inches taller.

225
00:16:12,232 --> 00:16:14,305
That was a terrific night, Jessie.

226
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,189
Some bacon and eggs,
a couple drinks.

227
00:16:19,656 --> 00:16:23,137
When I called, it wasn't just
to get together after all this time.

228
00:16:23,657 --> 00:16:25,348
- No?
- No. I wanted...

229
00:16:26,025 --> 00:16:29,800
I really wanted to ask you
about something. Your opinion.

230
00:16:30,121 --> 00:16:31,616
What?

231
00:16:33,097 --> 00:16:37,353
There's an ex-professor of mine,
he's a brilliant Chinese-American guy...

232
00:16:37,513 --> 00:16:39,815
...and he's got a scam.

233
00:16:40,649 --> 00:16:43,017
Says it's a good deal,
as easy as could be.

234
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:45,730
Nobody ever tells you a deal's hard, kid.

235
00:16:47,147 --> 00:16:48,935
Well, he needs an answer.

236
00:16:49,098 --> 00:16:52,743
I've stalled him for a couple of weeks,
but now he says he needs an answer.

237
00:16:52,907 --> 00:16:54,369
Says it means a lot of money.

238
00:16:56,171 --> 00:16:59,106
What's a Chinaman's idea
of a lot of money?

239
00:16:59,276 --> 00:17:00,519
A million dollars.

240
00:17:00,907 --> 00:17:03,241
More coffee, fellas?

241
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:08,068
- Leave it to me. I'll get Vito here.
- See you later.

242
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:10,789
I'm going upstairs
for a shower and a shave.

243
00:17:10,957 --> 00:17:12,811
- So I'll meet you here at 3?
- Right.

244
00:17:12,973 --> 00:17:15,656
Leave your old man to me.
I know which buttons to press.

245
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,381
All right.

246
00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:26,444
Hello, stranger. When they become
a success, they forget their roots.

247
00:17:26,637 --> 00:17:29,539
Vito, glad to see you back
on the West Side.

248
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:32,908
I remember Vito here
before he could talk.

249
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:35,787
Your grandfather was
running numbers out of this bar.

250
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:39,812
He'd bring Vito down in his baby
carriage and park him right here...

251
00:17:39,982 --> 00:17:42,535
...then tuck his policy slips
in your old man's blanket.

252
00:17:42,702 --> 00:17:46,019
That's how I learned to count.
How are you, Jessie?

253
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:49,257
- I pinched your father more than once.
- You're Doheny the cop?

254
00:17:49,455 --> 00:17:52,751
That's me.
You were too little to run in.

255
00:17:53,007 --> 00:17:57,317
He means Vito was too little to shake
down. Danny here would pinch me.

256
00:17:57,488 --> 00:18:01,066
Then when I made bail, he'd come
upstairs and sell me back my own slips.

257
00:18:01,232 --> 00:18:04,135
- You retired?
- I took early retirement.

258
00:18:04,465 --> 00:18:06,953
- The commissioner insisted on it.
- Thank the good Lord...

259
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,895
...I had a little money put by.
- You still hide it in the coffee cans?

260
00:18:11,248 --> 00:18:14,347
- What do you drink?
- Dewar's rocks, Danny.

261
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:19,216
- Nice guy.
- You gotta learn to judge people better.

262
00:18:19,857 --> 00:18:21,963
You two seem pretty cozy
all of a sudden.

263
00:18:22,482 --> 00:18:24,391
Hey, I'm his granddad,
for chrissakes.

264
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:27,977
Whatever craziness you're
cooking up these days, Jessie...

265
00:18:28,146 --> 00:18:29,259
...Adam can do without.

266
00:18:29,746 --> 00:18:32,780
I'm a man trying his best
to enjoy his golden years.

267
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:35,433
Just keep my son away
from your criminal schemes.

268
00:18:35,891 --> 00:18:37,833
Criminal schemes.

269
00:18:38,515 --> 00:18:40,719
It's eating you up
that you're getting old.

270
00:18:40,883 --> 00:18:43,305
Let no man say that Jessie Mac
went out lying down.

271
00:18:43,476 --> 00:18:47,600
Criminal schemes. That's a little rich
coming from an ex-con.

272
00:18:50,868 --> 00:18:52,275
You told him about that?

273
00:18:52,468 --> 00:18:56,146
Pop, Pop, 20 years in the same house.
Some things can't stay secret.

274
00:18:56,309 --> 00:18:59,156
- Just don't fuck up his life too.
- Too?

275
00:18:59,316 --> 00:19:02,448
Any deal you ever made with me,
you never saw a speck of trouble.

276
00:19:02,613 --> 00:19:06,541
It's when you took off on your own, like
an asshole with that retarded Polack...

277
00:19:06,709 --> 00:19:09,612
...that you wound up doing
your 27 months in the shitter.

278
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:11,604
And he's still blaming me.

279
00:19:11,797 --> 00:19:16,075
If you'd stuck with me, you'd have been
a part of that Westport Bank caper.

280
00:19:16,246 --> 00:19:19,312
So sweet.
200,000 chopped up four ways.

281
00:19:19,478 --> 00:19:21,104
Ask him where the money is now.

282
00:19:21,302 --> 00:19:23,986
Just where it ought to be.
It didn't have handles on it.

283
00:19:24,151 --> 00:19:27,315
Always remember, Adam. It only
costs 100% more to go first class.

284
00:19:27,511 --> 00:19:31,056
Ask him about the downside,
the couple of years you sit in the cage...

285
00:19:31,223 --> 00:19:33,525
...then spend the rest
of your life hiding it.

286
00:19:33,687 --> 00:19:36,754
Anybody who's embarrassed about
doing time is a goddamned snob.

287
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:40,302
You do your time nice, don't rat
anybody out, never take it in the ass...

288
00:19:40,472 --> 00:19:42,960
...what is there to be
embarrassed about?

289
00:19:43,128 --> 00:19:47,568
Vito, somewhere your values
got screwy.

290
00:19:47,768 --> 00:19:51,151
When did you get it in your head
that it was so terrible to be a thief?

291
00:19:51,352 --> 00:19:53,873
How do you get through to someone
who thinks like a Gypsy?

292
00:19:54,072 --> 00:19:56,560
- Right. Standup thieves, Gypsies.
- Right.

293
00:19:56,729 --> 00:20:00,504
Not a hypocritical bone in their bodies.
Hey, Margie.

294
00:20:00,857 --> 00:20:04,502
- You made bail.
- Thanks to my grandson Adam here.

295
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:06,968
- And my wonderful son Vito.
- How do you do?

296
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:11,156
It's nice to know you, Adam. Hi.
Vito? Margie.

297
00:20:11,322 --> 00:20:14,356
So how are the accommodations
at the tombs these days?

298
00:20:14,522 --> 00:20:16,563
- Three-star? Four-star?
- I'll survive.

299
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:18,640
There was never any question
about that.

300
00:20:18,811 --> 00:20:22,455
But did the other prisoners survive?
What about the poor guards?

301
00:20:22,619 --> 00:20:25,369
I don't go on for 15 minutes.
Can I buy you guys a drink?

302
00:20:25,531 --> 00:20:27,735
- No, we'll take a rain check.
- Oh, man talk.

303
00:20:27,899 --> 00:20:30,071
- Okay, see you later.
- Okay.

304
00:20:30,236 --> 00:20:32,854
- Listen, we still on for tonight?
- Yeah, sure.

305
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,442
It was very nice meeting you.

306
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:39,925
Jessie, are you involving
Adam in something?

307
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:45,137
- Just the safest, sweetest deal of
my life. - All right, stop right there...

308
00:20:45,308 --> 00:20:47,730
And he's not involving me,
it's my idea.

309
00:20:47,901 --> 00:20:50,683
- Your idea?
- My idea. That's right.

310
00:20:51,741 --> 00:20:54,163
Adam, what are you talking about?

311
00:20:54,877 --> 00:20:58,358
I'm talking about a lot of money, Pop.
And it's not even dangerous.

312
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:01,874
- Lf it's against the law, it's dangerous.
- No, no, this is a walk.

313
00:21:02,046 --> 00:21:04,861
- And it just needs a third guy.
- Needs a third guy, huh?

314
00:21:05,022 --> 00:21:07,837
Are you crazy? I spent my life
thieving with my father...

315
00:21:07,998 --> 00:21:10,453
...and now I'm gonna thieve
with my son? Crazy.

316
00:21:10,623 --> 00:21:12,565
Must be a full moon
I don't know about.

317
00:21:12,735 --> 00:21:14,939
Tell me, what is it
with these criminal genes?

318
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:19,892
Jesus, Vito. Don't get started
with that criminal-gene crap.

319
00:21:20,064 --> 00:21:23,162
Carnegie, Rockefeller. Those are
the guys with criminal genes...

320
00:21:23,327 --> 00:21:25,978
...the size of fucking grapefruits.

321
00:21:27,392 --> 00:21:30,971
You never really bought
that honesty shit.

322
00:21:31,137 --> 00:21:33,373
You've just been running scared
for 25 years.

323
00:21:33,536 --> 00:21:34,551
I'm scared for him.

324
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:36,792
I'm not a baby.
Let me be scared for me.

325
00:21:36,993 --> 00:21:39,164
If they catch you,
they lock you up. Listen.

326
00:21:39,328 --> 00:21:41,565
I learned long ago
it's not safe to be a thief.

327
00:21:41,761 --> 00:21:44,095
- You wanna get safe?
- Yeah, I wanna get safe.

328
00:21:44,289 --> 00:21:48,250
Go sit in one of your walk-in
refrigerators for the rest of your life.

329
00:21:48,418 --> 00:21:51,866
Who put it in your head that
being safe is what life is all about?

330
00:21:52,034 --> 00:21:54,139
- I'm too young to play it safe.
- And me too.

331
00:21:55,426 --> 00:21:57,815
This is fucking cuckoo.

332
00:21:59,906 --> 00:22:02,874
- Can I get another one?
- Give him two.

333
00:22:03,586 --> 00:22:07,613
Adam, let me get this straight. You'll
jeopardize your whole life for money?

334
00:22:07,811 --> 00:22:09,153
- For money?
- Yeah.

335
00:22:09,315 --> 00:22:13,210
If it was money I wanted, I'd think
about the wholesale meat business.

336
00:22:13,443 --> 00:22:15,069
Well, that was unfair.

337
00:22:15,236 --> 00:22:16,927
You know I hate the meat business.

338
00:22:17,092 --> 00:22:19,426
I broke my ass to give you
what he never gave me.

339
00:22:20,164 --> 00:22:22,684
- I never asked you for anything.
- You never had to.

340
00:22:22,852 --> 00:22:24,925
You had everything a kid ever wanted.

341
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:28,890
You didn't even need a scholarship.
I could have paid for your college twice.

342
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,555
- Without blinking.
- Pop.

343
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:33,572
This whole thing
has nothing to do with money.

344
00:22:33,733 --> 00:22:36,668
You've never understood me,
you still don't.

345
00:22:38,886 --> 00:22:42,050
- You're not doing this.
- I'm doing it.

346
00:22:42,214 --> 00:22:45,345
Whether you come or not.
Whether he comes or not.

347
00:22:46,022 --> 00:22:49,056
You wanna know something?
There's nothing you can do about it.

348
00:22:50,374 --> 00:22:52,894
- Nothing I can do?
- Right.

349
00:22:53,447 --> 00:22:55,902
There's nothing I can do?

350
00:23:18,888 --> 00:23:20,263
Vito.

351
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,975
That won't get you anywhere.

352
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:34,464
Here.

353
00:23:34,634 --> 00:23:38,857
Leave a 20. I don't want Doheny
telling people I raised a cheapskate.

354
00:23:54,987 --> 00:23:59,745
Come on. Hey! We got a deadline!
Let's go, man.

355
00:24:12,429 --> 00:24:15,211
Vito! Jesus, it's still dark out.

356
00:24:15,373 --> 00:24:17,380
You know, it's the early worm
gets caught.

357
00:24:17,549 --> 00:24:20,232
If it's about bail money, Jessie,
I'm about tapped out.

358
00:24:20,397 --> 00:24:22,088
I got work to do.

359
00:24:22,253 --> 00:24:25,352
I got bigger fish to fry
than a few bucks bail money.

360
00:24:25,518 --> 00:24:27,657
- Oh, yeah?
- But first of all...

361
00:24:27,822 --> 00:24:31,138
...who the hell smacks
a 23-year-old in public?

362
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:33,645
Punish him if you really
lose your temper, Vito.

363
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:35,977
But not a slap.

364
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:40,168
Look, Adam and I are meeting
at the weekend with a third guy...

365
00:24:40,334 --> 00:24:42,953
...for this score.
You've got till then to decide.

366
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:46,468
No, there's nothing to decide.
If anything happens to Adam...

367
00:24:46,671 --> 00:24:50,982
This is why you should come along.
Blood, Vito, blood.

368
00:24:51,151 --> 00:24:55,625
And it's the kind of work you do to a turn.
He's going anyway, you heard him.

369
00:24:55,792 --> 00:24:59,567
- He'll find two other guys.
- But you could talk him out of it.

370
00:25:00,273 --> 00:25:01,996
- I doubt it.
- Try.

371
00:25:02,449 --> 00:25:04,685
I'm not gonna try something
I don't believe in.

372
00:25:04,848 --> 00:25:07,751
- Why not?
- It's as sweet for me as it is for Adam.

373
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,342
It's your choice.

374
00:25:10,513 --> 00:25:14,507
I have another guy lined up, he's not
as good as you, but he's good enough.

375
00:25:15,249 --> 00:25:16,842
Who?

376
00:25:17,969 --> 00:25:20,719
- You've got till the weekend.
- Wait a minute, who?

377
00:25:21,874 --> 00:25:22,822
Who?

378
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:34,320
- Who?
- Johnny Hunt.

379
00:25:35,027 --> 00:25:36,304
Johnny Hunt.

380
00:25:36,467 --> 00:25:40,264
Well, you remember. His kid brother
got shot robbing a bank.

381
00:25:40,435 --> 00:25:42,989
- Johnny Hunt!
- He was never as bad as people said.

382
00:25:43,187 --> 00:25:45,424
He was a weasel 30 years ago,
he's still a weasel.

383
00:25:45,619 --> 00:25:49,842
People get a bum rap sometimes.
Johnny Hunt is a hell of a crib man.

384
00:25:50,036 --> 00:25:53,353
- He stinks, Jessie.
- I think you're wrong.

385
00:25:53,524 --> 00:25:55,794
But I wanted to give you
the shot at it.

386
00:25:55,988 --> 00:26:00,429
Jessie! Jessie! The guy stinks.

387
00:26:04,565 --> 00:26:06,987
- So, what's the story with Torres?
- I checked the carton...

388
00:26:07,157 --> 00:26:09,165
...he packed for Jimmy's Tavern.
- I knew it.

389
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:12,563
It was marked for 20 pounds of
short ribs and 30 pounds of chop.

390
00:26:12,726 --> 00:26:15,410
There were three fillets in it.
About an $80 difference.

391
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,428
You give the kid every break you can.

392
00:26:17,591 --> 00:26:19,446
- What do you wanna do?
- Send him in.

393
00:26:19,607 --> 00:26:22,422
Tommy, he sticks a boning knife
in his belt, you buzz me.

394
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:24,115
All right.

395
00:26:24,278 --> 00:26:27,345
That fucking kid. Listen...

396
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:32,374
Figure out what we owe Torres
as of yesterday afternoon.

397
00:26:35,383 --> 00:26:37,205
- Stealing?
- Yeah.

398
00:26:37,368 --> 00:26:40,270
- Two-forty, gross.
- What good is gross gonna do me?

399
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,735
You were a lot nicer boss when
we used to get laid once in a while.

400
00:26:43,896 --> 00:26:47,060
- The usual 12 fictitious dependents.
- Come on, how much?

401
00:26:47,224 --> 00:26:50,454
178.30. I don't think you get
enough sex these days.

402
00:26:50,617 --> 00:26:52,689
It wasn't meant to last.
There's a saying...

403
00:26:52,857 --> 00:26:54,264
"You don't crap where you eat."

404
00:26:54,425 --> 00:26:58,070
Listen to 20 years in the world of
commerce from the female point of view:

405
00:26:58,233 --> 00:27:00,240
Every guy who told you that
banged his bookkeeper.

406
00:27:00,409 --> 00:27:03,606
- How much was it?
- One seventy-eight and 30 cents.

407
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:05,719
Yeah, come on.

408
00:27:06,266 --> 00:27:09,582
- Tommy says you wanted to see me?
- Here's your pay through yesterday.

409
00:27:09,754 --> 00:27:11,893
Today's money goes toward
the meat you robbed.

410
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:14,710
Be out in five minutes
or I'll break your fucking legs.

411
00:27:14,875 --> 00:27:17,744
Robbing? Me, man?

412
00:27:20,123 --> 00:27:23,157
Wanna open up the boxes
for Jimmy's Tavern?

413
00:27:23,324 --> 00:27:25,429
Go ahead. Go ahead, open them up.

414
00:27:25,596 --> 00:27:28,760
Man, how am I gonna live
on the shit wages you paying?

415
00:27:28,988 --> 00:27:32,337
Where'd you come to borrow money
when your baby had pneumonia, Julio?

416
00:27:32,508 --> 00:27:34,875
Where? We treated you
like family here, right?

417
00:27:35,036 --> 00:27:37,851
Well, you just better hope
your family all stay healthy.

418
00:27:38,525 --> 00:27:40,630
- What did you say?
- I said you take...

419
00:27:55,581 --> 00:27:58,811
You busted my nose, man.

420
00:28:01,118 --> 00:28:03,420
- You working for a maniac, lady.
- Come on, go.

421
00:28:03,582 --> 00:28:07,477
He busted my beak over a piece of meat.

422
00:28:19,776 --> 00:28:23,072
Is this what's called a midlife crisis?

423
00:28:33,345 --> 00:28:36,192
Goodbye and God bless you,
Danny Doheny.

424
00:28:36,513 --> 00:28:40,474
Come on. It'll make you
feel better, Mrs. Doheny.

425
00:29:11,171 --> 00:29:13,473
If you're here to start
smacking me around again...

426
00:29:13,636 --> 00:29:16,418
No. I'm sorry about that.
I apologize.

427
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:19,929
Accepted. Let's forget it.

428
00:29:20,101 --> 00:29:21,661
I didn't expect to see you here.

429
00:29:21,828 --> 00:29:24,414
Guy was serving us drinks
four days ago.

430
00:29:24,581 --> 00:29:26,141
Yeah.

431
00:29:29,093 --> 00:29:31,549
You can't wheel my casket
dolly around the place.

432
00:29:31,717 --> 00:29:34,139
This is a wake.
There ought to be a little decorum.

433
00:29:34,309 --> 00:29:36,960
There's a barrel of beer on its way,
we need to set it on something.

434
00:29:37,157 --> 00:29:40,027
Not in my place. The Board of Health
can close me.

435
00:29:40,198 --> 00:29:43,547
Neary, since you've gone AA,
you're like a wet rag.

436
00:29:43,718 --> 00:29:47,198
It's illegal to even bring beer in here.

437
00:29:51,238 --> 00:29:53,955
Neary, the mortician.

438
00:29:54,118 --> 00:29:57,796
His sister Margaret, an ex-nun,
used to own a very classy, expensive...

439
00:29:57,959 --> 00:30:01,407
...nursery school down on Gramercy
Park. You interviewed for that.

440
00:30:01,863 --> 00:30:04,711
- An interview for a nursery school?
- It was very fancy.

441
00:30:04,872 --> 00:30:07,687
- What did they ask me?
- What you watched on TV...

442
00:30:07,848 --> 00:30:10,663
...did you know your ABCs...
- Of course I knew my ABCs.

443
00:30:10,824 --> 00:30:15,364
Adam, you read an entire
New York Times editorial on the U. N.

444
00:30:16,137 --> 00:30:19,268
- Adam, you missed exactly five words.
- Spare me the rest.

445
00:30:19,432 --> 00:30:21,888
- They offer me a scholarship?
- A scholarship?

446
00:30:22,057 --> 00:30:25,735
They would have paid $ 1000 a semester
just to get their hands on you.

447
00:30:25,898 --> 00:30:28,287
They wanted me for what
all the other schools did.

448
00:30:28,458 --> 00:30:32,517
Solve geometry problems in
the fourth grade for important visitors.

449
00:30:32,682 --> 00:30:35,365
I used to feel like a performing seal
at the blackboard.

450
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:39,617
- Adam, you were so gifted.
- Let's just drop it, Pop.

451
00:30:39,787 --> 00:30:41,761
A gift shouldn't be thrown
in the garbage.

452
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:45,411
- This is not the time or the place...
- This is the perfect time and place.

453
00:30:45,579 --> 00:30:48,962
See, I was raised to be a thief.
You weren't.

454
00:30:49,163 --> 00:30:53,670
- You don't have to go along.
- No, you, you don't have to go along.

455
00:30:53,836 --> 00:30:57,000
- That's the real point.
- I wanna go along.

456
00:31:00,588 --> 00:31:03,523
Your mom and I had such
enormous hopes for you, kiddo.

457
00:31:05,453 --> 00:31:08,682
- Nobody's hopes work out, Pop.
- Right.

458
00:31:08,973 --> 00:31:10,980
I'm half your age, I already know that.

459
00:31:12,685 --> 00:31:16,002
Well, a toast seems appropriate.

460
00:31:17,645 --> 00:31:19,881
- To Danny Doheny.
- To hell with him.

461
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:22,151
To McMullens.

462
00:31:27,726 --> 00:31:31,980
Now then, lucky lads, let's catch up
on a little family business.

463
00:31:32,143 --> 00:31:34,990
Yeah. Nothing like a good robbery
to bring a family close.

464
00:31:35,151 --> 00:31:37,704
He's such a fucking
wisenheimer, your father.

465
00:31:37,871 --> 00:31:41,548
- Does he do the same to you?
- Probably a little less than I do to him.

466
00:31:41,711 --> 00:31:43,784
Let's make a decision.

467
00:31:44,943 --> 00:31:47,180
- Let's.
- Talk.

468
00:31:48,879 --> 00:31:51,051
Are you familiar at all
with DNA research?

469
00:31:51,216 --> 00:31:53,867
Yeah, I read a couple
of magazine articles.

470
00:31:54,032 --> 00:31:56,683
Gene-splicing.
You know, they're breeding chickens...

471
00:31:56,849 --> 00:31:59,948
...that weigh more than you or me.
Try to keep current, huh?

472
00:32:00,113 --> 00:32:02,731
Well, nobody knows
what's gonna happen yet...

473
00:32:02,897 --> 00:32:05,450
...but the possibilities look limitless.

474
00:32:05,617 --> 00:32:07,373
The small companies
who are in it first...

475
00:32:07,537 --> 00:32:11,978
...are hoping to be the IBMs and
the Bell Telephones 20 years from now.

476
00:32:12,146 --> 00:32:15,244
There's a new red-hot,
very secret development.

477
00:32:15,409 --> 00:32:19,239
It's an agricultural plasmid.
Yeasts that are fixing nitrogen.

478
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:21,712
That means that you could
raise wheat, corn...

479
00:32:21,874 --> 00:32:25,616
...damn near anything to grow
with no fertilizer.

480
00:32:25,778 --> 00:32:27,688
The stakes are enormous.
Farmers spend billions...

481
00:32:27,859 --> 00:32:30,706
Fuck the farmers.
Tell him what our end is.

482
00:32:31,347 --> 00:32:33,387
Jimmy Chiu,
an ex-professor of mine...

483
00:32:33,555 --> 00:32:37,068
...he works at a biology lab
out in Nassau County.

484
00:32:37,235 --> 00:32:39,024
He helped found the company.

485
00:32:39,188 --> 00:32:41,228
They screwed him out
of his piece of the action.

486
00:32:41,396 --> 00:32:45,455
- They fired this poor Chink.
- Yeah, I hear him.

487
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:48,784
He's got some venture capital ready
to set up a new company.

488
00:32:48,949 --> 00:32:51,469
They need the new plasmids.

489
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:56,525
He gets us in easy.
High stakes. Low risk. Nonviolent.

490
00:32:56,693 --> 00:33:00,468
No worries about our partners
robbing us or ratting us out.

491
00:33:01,301 --> 00:33:03,690
Look, if we get the plasmids
and the logbook...

492
00:33:03,861 --> 00:33:06,731
...Jimmy Chiu pays us
an even million.

493
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:10,284
You gotta sell a lot of veal cutlets
to match that, Vito.

494
00:33:15,319 --> 00:33:18,036
So this whole score
is like one big fancy burglary.

495
00:33:18,199 --> 00:33:19,181
Yeah.

496
00:33:19,351 --> 00:33:23,694
- Does anyone else know about this?
- No one, just the three of us.

497
00:33:23,863 --> 00:33:25,292
What do you think, Pop?

498
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,029
What do I think?

499
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:42,194
When you were talking
about yeast-fixing nitrogen...

500
00:33:42,361 --> 00:33:46,038
...the look on your face...
- You're in or you're out, but no lectures.

501
00:33:46,201 --> 00:33:49,103
I'm in. I'm in. I'm in.

502
00:33:49,273 --> 00:33:51,313
You're happy now, huh?

503
00:33:52,025 --> 00:33:53,235
- I'm in.
- Yeah.

504
00:33:53,401 --> 00:33:58,290
- To the Gypsies of the world.
- Not a hypocritical bone in their bodies.

505
00:34:01,722 --> 00:34:04,471
Come on. Let's pay our respects
to the grieving widow...

506
00:34:04,634 --> 00:34:07,482
...before she falls flat
on her face, drunk.

507
00:34:13,211 --> 00:34:15,382
- How you doing, Jess?
- Hi, Phil.

508
00:34:15,547 --> 00:34:18,198
Vito, it's been a long time.

509
00:34:23,036 --> 00:34:25,240
Well, Phil, busy, busy, busy.

510
00:34:25,404 --> 00:34:28,306
It's my crowd.
Listen, these are Yves Saint Laurent.

511
00:34:28,476 --> 00:34:30,647
They're 800 a pop
in the better stores.

512
00:34:30,812 --> 00:34:34,042
Fell off a truck.
I'll let them go for 200 apiece.

513
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:36,955
Let's see here.
You know, 38's on the left.

514
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:41,208
Ladies and gentlemen, we're supposed
to be closing in a little bit...

515
00:34:41,373 --> 00:34:44,690
...but I think it would be a crime
to have a 10:00 last call...

516
00:34:44,862 --> 00:34:50,230
...for Danny Doheny's wake,
so closing time is extended.

517
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:52,438
Give me that back.

518
00:34:55,262 --> 00:34:57,499
Kevin, Michael...

519
00:34:57,662 --> 00:35:00,051
...the song for Danny.

520
00:35:54,179 --> 00:35:57,561
This your basic
old-fashioned Irish wake?

521
00:35:58,371 --> 00:36:00,313
When it's run right.

522
00:36:25,029 --> 00:36:28,128
Between the keycard
and these cockamamie rent-a-cops...

523
00:36:28,293 --> 00:36:30,017
...getting in will be a cinch.

524
00:36:30,181 --> 00:36:33,215
- Vito, let's get out of here.
- But first we'll go back to the motel.

525
00:36:33,382 --> 00:36:36,797
I wanna take a dry run
as soon as it gets dark.

526
00:36:46,279 --> 00:36:50,109
Being back in action, it agrees with you.
Puts a little bounce in your step.

527
00:36:50,279 --> 00:36:53,149
You're giving me some sound advice
on how to conduct my life?

528
00:36:53,319 --> 00:36:55,206
- That's what fathers are for.
- Right.

529
00:36:55,367 --> 00:36:58,684
The bounce will stay in my step
as long as I get my share.

530
00:36:58,856 --> 00:37:00,765
Did I ever cheat you
out of a nickel?

531
00:37:00,936 --> 00:37:04,198
For starters, start with the $ 10
I never got out of that Lionel train...

532
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,727
Are you still whining
about those fucking trains?

533
00:37:06,888 --> 00:37:09,736
- I'll buy you a set for Christmas.
- I'll hold my breath.

534
00:37:09,896 --> 00:37:12,285
You can carry a grudge
for 30 years.

535
00:37:12,457 --> 00:37:14,628
That's the Sicilian genes.

536
00:37:15,144 --> 00:37:18,178
Now, I'm pretty sure
that the bar is over there.

537
00:37:18,345 --> 00:37:20,833
It's in the restaurant, of course.

538
00:37:21,002 --> 00:37:23,042
Let's have a drink.

539
00:37:24,457 --> 00:37:26,465
After I shower.

540
00:37:27,242 --> 00:37:31,366
- Honest work makes honest sweat.
- You're a bad influence.

541
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:35,139
Now, I know this
is gonna sound gross...

542
00:37:35,595 --> 00:37:38,595
...but you've gotta accept
the cab fare.

543
00:37:38,762 --> 00:37:42,276
I hear they're very expensive
in the suburbs.

544
00:37:42,986 --> 00:37:47,744
So I figured 150 ought to cover it.

545
00:37:47,915 --> 00:37:50,785
That sounds right for the meter,
but we have to tip the driver too.

546
00:37:50,956 --> 00:37:53,411
Jesus. We can't have
some hard-working refugee...

547
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:56,711
...from Bangladesh going tipless.

548
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,722
Well...

549
00:37:58,892 --> 00:38:00,802
...will 200 cover it?

550
00:38:00,973 --> 00:38:02,795
We don't live near each other.

551
00:38:02,956 --> 00:38:06,469
Separate cabs, of course.
That was understood from the get go.

552
00:38:06,636 --> 00:38:10,117
- Vito, Margo and Denise.
- How you doing?

553
00:38:10,285 --> 00:38:13,863
It was, "I was champion
baton twirler of 19..."

554
00:38:14,029 --> 00:38:15,753
1983.

555
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:20,653
I always thought that baton twirling
ought to be an Olympic event.

556
00:38:20,814 --> 00:38:21,959
What do you think, Vito?

557
00:38:22,126 --> 00:38:24,493
No, I think the Chinese
would dominate in no time.

558
00:38:24,654 --> 00:38:27,273
Not against your all-American girl
they wouldn't.

559
00:38:27,439 --> 00:38:30,984
- Well, I could be wrong.
- So the game is on?

560
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:33,834
Yeah, I just have to get rid
of a previous appointment.

561
00:38:33,999 --> 00:38:35,908
Why don't you order us
another round?

562
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,705
Yeah, sure.

563
00:38:37,871 --> 00:38:41,449
- Why don't you do that, Pop?
- Jessie.

564
00:38:42,864 --> 00:38:45,930
What are you doing sitting here
talking to a couple of hookers?

565
00:38:46,096 --> 00:38:49,609
It's a vulgar way to refer to a woman.
I never brought you up to talk like that.

566
00:38:49,776 --> 00:38:51,882
Are you gonna tell me
those are not hookers?

567
00:38:52,048 --> 00:38:55,049
- Well, who are we to judge?
- All right.

568
00:38:55,216 --> 00:38:57,159
I don't wanna put
a crimp in your style...

569
00:38:57,328 --> 00:38:59,849
...but it's been 10 years
since I had to go home and lie...

570
00:39:00,017 --> 00:39:04,174
...so I'm gonna pass. All right?
- Vito.

571
00:39:07,953 --> 00:39:11,565
Can't you ever
just have a good time?

572
00:39:11,729 --> 00:39:13,159
Yeah.

573
00:39:13,554 --> 00:39:17,809
I mean, doesn't this beat
cutting up cows on 14th Street?

574
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:20,426
Well, you know, we'll see.

575
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:39,246
Touch football, look at them.

576
00:39:39,411 --> 00:39:41,746
Like a pack of kids playing soldiers.

577
00:39:41,908 --> 00:39:44,330
- Did you ever play any sports, Jessie?
- Yeah.

578
00:39:44,501 --> 00:39:47,850
I ran the 100-yard dash
with two cops behind me.

579
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:50,770
Vito thought he was an athlete though.

580
00:39:50,932 --> 00:39:55,024
I remember having to stop your father
from signing up for high school football.

581
00:39:55,189 --> 00:39:58,801
Before that it was the Cub Scouts.
Football, fucking Cub Scouts.

582
00:39:58,965 --> 00:40:01,332
He had a lot of tendencies
in that direction.

583
00:40:01,493 --> 00:40:04,177
Sounds like your son wanted
to be middle class.

584
00:40:04,342 --> 00:40:06,164
He still does.

585
00:40:06,326 --> 00:40:09,971
- You'll see that when you meet his wife.
- Stop it.

586
00:40:11,702 --> 00:40:14,157
It's where all the action is.

587
00:40:14,326 --> 00:40:18,255
I just hope the co-op market holds up
for another three years.

588
00:40:18,422 --> 00:40:21,554
You know, Christine, there must be
hundreds of people out there...

589
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:24,436
...buying up insiders' rights
and selling them on the open market.

590
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:26,771
I mean, you must be pretty good at it.

591
00:40:26,936 --> 00:40:30,067
How do you compete, dear?

592
00:40:30,232 --> 00:40:31,923
Well...

593
00:40:32,568 --> 00:40:35,699
- You gotta have a gimmick.
- Yeah?

594
00:40:35,864 --> 00:40:37,424
You do?

595
00:40:39,833 --> 00:40:41,589
I have this friend named Gertrude...

596
00:40:41,753 --> 00:40:45,102
...and she works at Sloan-Kettering
Hospital in admissions.

597
00:40:45,273 --> 00:40:48,502
And every time there's a new patient
with one of the cancers...

598
00:40:48,665 --> 00:40:50,389
...that nothing can be done for...

599
00:40:50,554 --> 00:40:53,140
...if they live in Manhattan,
I check it out.

600
00:40:53,305 --> 00:40:55,891
While these people live in buildings
that have gone co-op...

601
00:40:56,058 --> 00:40:58,131
...and they haven't bought...

602
00:40:58,298 --> 00:41:01,614
...you can buy occupied apartments
at insider prices in those buildings.

603
00:41:01,786 --> 00:41:05,332
But the problem is, the tenant's likely
to stay there for 20 years. Right?

604
00:41:05,499 --> 00:41:07,801
- Yeah. Right.
- Well...

605
00:41:07,963 --> 00:41:12,502
...Gertrude and I snap up an apartment
that will be vacant in six months.

606
00:41:12,667 --> 00:41:15,831
At which point,
we double our investment.

607
00:41:19,259 --> 00:41:22,227
We are sitting on seven prime
Manhattan apartments...

608
00:41:22,395 --> 00:41:25,046
...and every tenant terminal.

609
00:41:33,341 --> 00:41:35,196
If I were you and Gertrude,
I would hope...

610
00:41:35,357 --> 00:41:37,626
...that God does not have
a sense of humor.

611
00:41:41,821 --> 00:41:44,724
Well, the apartment
would just revert back...

612
00:41:44,893 --> 00:41:48,952
...to the original building owner. What's
the difference who turns the profit?

613
00:41:49,118 --> 00:41:53,177
The difference is, you're mucking around
in other people's misery.

614
00:41:53,342 --> 00:41:55,350
When you rob someone legally...

615
00:41:55,518 --> 00:42:00,854
...without risk, without sticking
your neck out, that's immoral.

616
00:42:01,023 --> 00:42:04,122
Where did you find
this fucking parasite?

617
00:42:05,919 --> 00:42:07,829
Parasite?

618
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,062
Yeah, it's...

619
00:42:12,415 --> 00:42:14,968
- It's like a leech.
- Did you hear that, Adam?

620
00:42:15,136 --> 00:42:18,552
Your grandfather feels breaking the law
would make Christine more moral?

621
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,575
It would. Like most people, Elaine...

622
00:42:20,736 --> 00:42:22,777
...you confuse what's moral
with what's legal.

623
00:42:22,944 --> 00:42:26,240
No. Like most people, I recognize
that in a reasonably just society...

624
00:42:26,401 --> 00:42:29,533
"A reasonably just society."
Well, tell me when you find one.

625
00:42:29,697 --> 00:42:32,730
You agree with your paternal grandfather
that legality means nothing?

626
00:42:32,897 --> 00:42:37,175
Which means that you can go blithely
through life doing just as you please.

627
00:42:37,345 --> 00:42:40,826
- My "paternal" grandfather?
- Yeah, he's a defendant in this case.

628
00:42:40,994 --> 00:42:44,028
You still haven't answered, Adam.
He's your guest.

629
00:42:44,194 --> 00:42:48,635
- Well, I came here to eat.
- Come on. Hey, more meat.

630
00:42:52,099 --> 00:42:55,514
- You wanna make a fight over this?
- You should have given me support.

631
00:42:55,683 --> 00:42:59,066
No, you don't come on like a parent
with Adam's idol sitting at the table.

632
00:42:59,235 --> 00:43:01,024
Why are you such a dishrag
with Adam?

633
00:43:01,187 --> 00:43:03,609
We try and try to show him
who Christine really is...

634
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:05,722
...and Jessie does it in two minutes.
- Fine.

635
00:43:05,892 --> 00:43:07,866
You see how he looks up to Jessie.

636
00:43:08,036 --> 00:43:11,233
You, better than anyone, should know
how destructive that can be.

637
00:43:11,396 --> 00:43:13,436
Take a stand, Vito.

638
00:43:19,653 --> 00:43:21,311
What will Adam do with himself?

639
00:43:21,477 --> 00:43:24,674
It will break my heart if he doesn't
go back and get his master's.

640
00:43:24,837 --> 00:43:26,910
- So tell him.
- He's 23 years old, Elaine.

641
00:43:27,077 --> 00:43:29,761
It used to be,
"He's 15 years old, Elaine."

642
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:37,987
Attention, shoppers. Socket wrench sets
are on sale in aisle 26.

643
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:42,559
These are 55- piece sets
complete with ratcheting carrier.

644
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:54,149
You sure all this stuff isn't overkill?
I have a keycard.

645
00:43:54,312 --> 00:43:56,767
Do you know what you'll find
when you go in there?

646
00:43:56,936 --> 00:44:01,922
Whatever we find inside, just leave it
to your old man to get us through. Okay?

647
00:44:02,088 --> 00:44:04,838
Hey, Vito. Tell him
the Peewee Grogan story.

648
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,782
Please, we can do
without the Peewee Grogan story.

649
00:44:07,944 --> 00:44:10,017
Your father was 17 or 18.

650
00:44:10,185 --> 00:44:13,382
Peewee was a couple of years older.

651
00:44:13,545 --> 00:44:15,781
He was a tough little thief
from 9th Avenue.

652
00:44:15,945 --> 00:44:18,793
Couple of inches shorter
and he'd have wound up in the circus.

653
00:44:18,953 --> 00:44:23,493
Used to say, in a street fight, he could
hit you with overhand left to the balls.

654
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:26,339
The three of us went after
a load of French perfume.

655
00:44:26,506 --> 00:44:29,987
- It was sitting in a warehouse out in...
- Bush terminal.

656
00:44:30,155 --> 00:44:31,431
Right.

657
00:44:31,594 --> 00:44:34,693
God. We stripped Peewee naked.

658
00:44:34,858 --> 00:44:38,022
We smeared him from head to foot
with Vaseline.

659
00:44:38,187 --> 00:44:42,727
Now, this kid squeezed through
25 feet of air-conditioning duct.

660
00:44:42,892 --> 00:44:44,801
And when he opened the door for us...

661
00:44:44,971 --> 00:44:46,695
...he was dripping blood.

662
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:50,056
Hundreds of little gashes
where he'd ripped himself to shreds...

663
00:44:50,219 --> 00:44:52,969
...on the heads of the nails
going through.

664
00:44:53,132 --> 00:44:56,361
- Vito, that dwarf had heart.
- Yeah, that he did.

665
00:44:56,525 --> 00:44:59,176
- We worked for six hours.
- No, five and a half.

666
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:01,228
- Six.
- Five and a half.

667
00:45:01,388 --> 00:45:03,657
On an inside steel door...

668
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:06,919
...with 25 grand of French perfume
on the other side.

669
00:45:07,085 --> 00:45:10,631
We took turns with a sledgehammer.
We battered it. We hammered it.

670
00:45:10,797 --> 00:45:14,278
We tried everything.
We even tried to cry our way through.

671
00:45:14,446 --> 00:45:18,723
- Vito, am I exaggerating?
- Just finish the story, Pop.

672
00:45:18,894 --> 00:45:22,691
Finally, Peewee knelt down
and prayed.

673
00:45:22,862 --> 00:45:25,448
He swore this was gonna be
his last burglary...

674
00:45:25,614 --> 00:45:29,673
...if only God would let us open
that fucking door.

675
00:45:29,838 --> 00:45:34,279
You see, what the job called for
was a three-foot pry bar.

676
00:45:34,447 --> 00:45:37,262
Your old man hadn't brought one.

677
00:45:37,423 --> 00:45:41,515
So we left empty-handed.
Peewee left a pint of blood behind...

678
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:45,389
...and Vito swore he'd never go
on another job under-equipped.

679
00:45:45,552 --> 00:45:48,421
Your grandpa's moral
is to be prepared like a Boy Scout.

680
00:45:48,592 --> 00:45:50,567
But what he's forgetting
is that it was him...

681
00:45:50,737 --> 00:45:52,744
...that should have brought
the pry bar.

682
00:45:52,913 --> 00:45:56,655
- Bullshit. The tools were your end.
- The tools were my end? I beg to differ.

683
00:45:56,817 --> 00:45:58,640
Whatever happened
to Peewee Grogan?

684
00:45:58,801 --> 00:46:02,696
Peewee? Well, he wound up
doing 15 to 30 as an habitual.

685
00:46:02,866 --> 00:46:06,030
And that's tough time for a guy
4-foot-2.

686
00:46:06,194 --> 00:46:11,180
You're really an asshole sometimes.
You really are a fucking asshole.

687
00:46:19,058 --> 00:46:22,407
What would you do for sex
if I were gone for a couple of years?

688
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:26,474
- You planning on joining the Navy?
- No, it's a hypothetical question.

689
00:46:26,643 --> 00:46:30,418
Suppose, God forbid,
I got put in prison for two or three years.

690
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:33,296
What would you do for sex?

691
00:46:33,524 --> 00:46:36,175
- I hadn't really thought about it.
- Yeah, well...

692
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:39,656
But now that you mention it,
there is this one big good-looking kid...

693
00:46:39,828 --> 00:46:43,603
...works the vegetable counter
in Grand Union. He's crazy about me.

694
00:46:43,764 --> 00:46:45,390
Oh, yeah?

695
00:46:50,133 --> 00:46:52,850
You been overreaching
on your tax-evasion schemes?

696
00:46:53,013 --> 00:46:58,251
I'll bet the vegetable kid in Grand Union
doesn't really love you.

697
00:47:00,598 --> 00:47:04,559
Not gonna start moralizing, are you,
robbing Uncle Sam for undeclared cash?

698
00:47:04,727 --> 00:47:09,233
- No, I was just talking.
- Don't go so far they really lock you up.

699
00:47:09,398 --> 00:47:12,465
We're not as tough as we used to be.

700
00:47:14,199 --> 00:47:16,752
I waited 27 months to marry you, Vito.

701
00:47:16,919 --> 00:47:21,142
I rode on a bus six hours every Saturday
and never missed a visit.

702
00:47:21,304 --> 00:47:23,890
We were a couple of kids then.

703
00:47:24,056 --> 00:47:27,285
But I couldn't take it
if you went away now.

704
00:47:28,184 --> 00:47:31,446
Besides, how would you be able
to face Adam?

705
00:47:47,418 --> 00:47:49,839
All right. All right. All right.

706
00:47:50,138 --> 00:47:52,277
Everything's the same.
One security guard.

707
00:47:52,441 --> 00:47:54,962
- I told you this was gonna be a snap.
- Yeah?

708
00:47:55,130 --> 00:47:57,912
- He's armed?
- His holster was on the back of the chair.

709
00:47:58,074 --> 00:48:01,719
He's sitting there watching TV
with his shoes off.

710
00:48:01,882 --> 00:48:03,409
Guard had a gun?

711
00:48:04,699 --> 00:48:06,488
Yeah, what did you expect?

712
00:48:06,651 --> 00:48:10,579
- I didn't really think about it.
- Well, welcome to the real world.

713
00:48:10,747 --> 00:48:13,879
Relax. He's got one,
we'll have three.

714
00:48:14,044 --> 00:48:17,360
- Two. He doesn't carry a gun.
- I don't wanna anybody carrying a gun.

715
00:48:17,532 --> 00:48:21,526
What you think, they'll mail us the
what do you call them? The plasmids?

716
00:48:21,692 --> 00:48:25,915
- Lf you don't wanna do this, say so.
- Vito, you're doing what you always do...

717
00:48:26,077 --> 00:48:29,721
...you're treating him like a kid.
Adam should go in there packing.

718
00:48:29,884 --> 00:48:32,568
He's never done it, Jessie.
He does not carry.

719
00:48:32,733 --> 00:48:35,548
- We vote!
- We don't vote. He doesn't carry!

720
00:48:35,709 --> 00:48:38,491
If Adam carries, I walk.

721
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:08,635
Close the lid.

722
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:45,179
- Wait. Didn't you bring any gloves?
- No.

723
00:49:48,899 --> 00:49:51,801
Put that on.
Come on, come on, come on!

724
00:49:55,716 --> 00:49:57,406
Say when.

725
00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:36,129
- All right?
- Okay.

726
00:50:36,295 --> 00:50:37,855
Go ahead.

727
00:50:42,439 --> 00:50:44,414
Sit tight. I'll check out the guard.

728
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:46,558
Pull this. I can't see.

729
00:50:52,167 --> 00:50:55,680
This is why I hated
putting on your snowsuit.

730
00:51:01,353 --> 00:51:04,004
I was on much tougher scores
than this at your age.

731
00:51:04,169 --> 00:51:08,293
All I saw out of them was a ham
sandwich. You're starting at the top.

732
00:51:08,457 --> 00:51:11,905
Yeah, that's America.
Every generation does a little bit better.

733
00:51:35,627 --> 00:51:38,943
- What if he's out making rounds?
- He's snoozing somewhere.

734
00:51:39,115 --> 00:51:42,279
The work ethic in America
is dead and buried.

735
00:51:42,444 --> 00:51:44,354
- Let's do it.
- Here.

736
00:52:22,159 --> 00:52:24,014
Freeze!

737
00:52:24,911 --> 00:52:26,340
Where the hell is he?

738
00:52:30,671 --> 00:52:33,639
He could be off taking a leak
or making rounds.

739
00:52:34,159 --> 00:52:36,713
Then we sit tight and wait for him.

740
00:52:39,568 --> 00:52:42,470
- Did you close the hall doors?
- I think so.

741
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:44,779
No. You can't think so.

742
00:52:44,945 --> 00:52:48,523
You're sure you did or you're sure
you didn't or you don't know.

743
00:52:48,689 --> 00:52:50,118
I don't know.

744
00:52:50,289 --> 00:52:52,744
If the guard sees an open door,
it's all over.

745
00:52:52,913 --> 00:52:54,702
I'll take this corridor.
You take that one.

746
00:52:54,865 --> 00:52:57,680
Adam, stay here in case
he's on his way back with a six-pack.

747
00:52:57,841 --> 00:53:01,038
Wait. What does he do
if the guard walks in?

748
00:53:03,282 --> 00:53:05,453
So let him take a piece.

749
00:53:08,498 --> 00:53:10,320
No.

750
00:53:12,242 --> 00:53:15,112
- You got a say in this too, you know.
- No, he doesn't.

751
00:53:16,788 --> 00:53:19,657
- Move and I'll kill you.
- Come here.

752
00:53:24,692 --> 00:53:26,253
Put your hands together.

753
00:53:33,652 --> 00:53:36,620
I'm marking your outline on the floor
with a piece of chalk.

754
00:53:36,788 --> 00:53:39,571
Now, when we get back,
any part of you outside that line...

755
00:53:39,732 --> 00:53:42,993
...gets shot away. You follow?

756
00:54:42,547 --> 00:54:45,896
- I hope he knows where he's going.
- It's his show.

757
00:55:24,626 --> 00:55:27,047
Did we bust into the wrong place,
for chrissakes?

758
00:55:27,218 --> 00:55:29,323
- He knows what he's doing.
- Yeah.

759
00:56:14,129 --> 00:56:15,339
This is it.

760
00:56:53,392 --> 00:56:55,083
We're taking too long.

761
00:57:02,064 --> 00:57:03,558
This is odd.

762
00:57:03,728 --> 00:57:05,419
What?

763
00:57:06,672 --> 00:57:09,389
I'd like to get the hell out of here.

764
00:57:19,792 --> 00:57:21,701
Pop?

765
00:57:44,431 --> 00:57:45,805
That's the whole show?

766
00:57:45,967 --> 00:57:50,124
Unless you wanna tell us
the Peewee Grogan story again.

767
00:58:15,887 --> 00:58:17,610
Go! Go!

768
00:58:20,142 --> 00:58:21,157
What about the guard?

769
00:58:21,327 --> 00:58:23,715
The longer he thinks we're here,
the better.

770
00:58:35,343 --> 00:58:37,579
No, Jessie, wait. Wait.

771
00:58:40,143 --> 00:58:41,091
Go.

772
00:58:49,838 --> 00:58:51,016
What?

773
00:58:51,182 --> 00:58:53,254
Do either of you have the logbook?

774
00:58:53,422 --> 00:58:54,884
- No.
- Shit!

775
00:58:55,118 --> 00:58:56,263
We got the tubes.

776
00:58:56,462 --> 00:58:59,113
- They're also paying for the logbook.
- I'll go back.

777
00:58:59,278 --> 00:59:01,350
There's a stack of logbooks
in that desk.

778
00:59:01,517 --> 00:59:03,208
Easy, you just tell me which one.

779
00:59:03,374 --> 00:59:05,610
I'm the gifted Westinghouse Scholar.
I'll get it.

780
00:59:05,773 --> 00:59:08,937
- No, no, Adam, wait a minute. Adam!
- Hey!

781
00:59:09,101 --> 00:59:11,654
- Let's get these in the car.
- I'll wait here.

782
00:59:11,822 --> 00:59:15,270
We gotta be ready to roll
when he gets out. Now come on.

783
01:00:21,452 --> 01:00:23,274
You okay?

784
01:00:23,596 --> 01:00:27,851
Okay, we'll be out in
about a half an hour.

785
01:00:44,108 --> 01:00:45,602
Oh, God!

786
01:00:45,772 --> 01:00:47,681
God!

787
01:01:10,348 --> 01:01:14,090
You can't do anything out there. Just
be ready to gun this fucking thing...

788
01:01:14,251 --> 01:01:16,804
...if the kid makes it.
- Lf?

789
01:02:02,187 --> 01:02:04,194
Freeze!

790
01:02:18,570 --> 01:02:20,577
Who's with you?

791
01:02:21,801 --> 01:02:25,893
There's two of them.
They're still in the building.

792
01:02:41,321 --> 01:02:42,663
Move out, Vito.

793
01:02:49,001 --> 01:02:50,757
No lights.

794
01:02:51,241 --> 01:02:52,997
Glide.

795
01:03:06,537 --> 01:03:08,512
Stop.

796
01:03:14,441 --> 01:03:18,598
Let's go, Vito. Drive.

797
01:03:45,161 --> 01:03:46,949
Vito?

798
01:03:48,297 --> 01:03:49,987
Yeah.

799
01:03:50,152 --> 01:03:52,062
What time is it?

800
01:03:54,152 --> 01:03:57,567
About... About 3:00.

801
01:04:03,752 --> 01:04:07,746
- How'd you do?
- I lost about 60 bucks.

802
01:04:12,232 --> 01:04:15,101
I tried getting Adam earlier.

803
01:04:16,551 --> 01:04:18,940
Oh, yeah? What for?

804
01:04:19,112 --> 01:04:20,454
I was thinking...

805
01:04:20,616 --> 01:04:23,682
...the other day at dinner I came
down on him a little too hard.

806
01:04:23,848 --> 01:04:26,149
I want to tell him that.

807
01:04:26,567 --> 01:04:29,502
I'll try getting him again tomorrow.

808
01:04:31,271 --> 01:04:33,693
He... He didn't tell you?

809
01:04:33,864 --> 01:04:37,857
He went up to Cambridge
for a few days.

810
01:04:38,023 --> 01:04:41,438
He wanted to see
some college friends.

811
01:04:41,607 --> 01:04:44,062
It's a glimmer of hope.

812
01:04:44,903 --> 01:04:47,205
Yeah, yeah.

813
01:04:49,927 --> 01:04:53,473
I know you don't wanna hear this,
but Adam leaving school isn't that bad.

814
01:04:53,639 --> 01:04:55,678
He's still growing up.
And you know what?

815
01:04:55,847 --> 01:04:59,360
He'll outgrow Jessie too.
He'll see through him.

816
01:05:00,710 --> 01:05:03,045
He's your son, Vito.

817
01:05:04,007 --> 01:05:06,079
You'll see.

818
01:05:10,310 --> 01:05:12,318
Am I wrong?

819
01:05:27,238 --> 01:05:29,180
No...

820
01:05:30,151 --> 01:05:31,677
...I'm sure you're right.

821
01:05:35,046 --> 01:05:38,342
You're depressed.
You lost more than 60 bucks.

822
01:05:39,750 --> 01:05:41,441
Yeah.

823
01:05:45,830 --> 01:05:49,441
Look, I got a boy just about your age.

824
01:05:50,566 --> 01:05:52,868
What are you 20, 21?

825
01:05:53,030 --> 01:05:55,299
My name is Adam McQuade.
I'm homeless.

826
01:05:55,462 --> 01:05:58,309
I'm waiting for my lawyer to get here.

827
01:05:59,109 --> 01:06:01,346
Your buddies left you there.

828
01:06:01,510 --> 01:06:04,543
My name is Adam McQuade.

829
01:06:06,405 --> 01:06:12,002
When you been up in Attica 10 years,
surrounded by psychotics...

830
01:06:12,165 --> 01:06:15,995
...you're gonna wish you'd taken
a little fatherly advice.

831
01:06:42,757 --> 01:06:46,499
Hey, you're nervous. I'll drive.

832
01:06:48,901 --> 01:06:50,908
Well, it's going to be expensive.

833
01:06:52,005 --> 01:06:53,150
We're not rich people.

834
01:06:53,317 --> 01:06:55,935
Your attorney should've recommended
a cheaper lawyer.

835
01:06:56,101 --> 01:06:59,930
- No one's crying poverty here.
- All I'm saying is, this is family money.

836
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:03,875
Money I managed to squirrel away
after 50 years hard work.

837
01:07:04,036 --> 01:07:07,232
You saw Adam. Can we drop the
subject of money and hear how he is?

838
01:07:07,396 --> 01:07:09,219
No, we can't. I bill for time.

839
01:07:09,381 --> 01:07:11,999
Mine, the lawyers on my staff,
a couple of paralegals.

840
01:07:12,165 --> 01:07:13,888
My office time is 150 an hour.

841
01:07:14,244 --> 01:07:17,211
My court time, and no one but me
will ever be in a courtroom...

842
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:21,209
...is $ 1500 per day.
- Fifteen hundred?!

843
01:07:21,380 --> 01:07:24,729
That's where my talent runs rampant,
and I charge accordingly.

844
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:26,493
Would you sit down, please?

845
01:07:30,084 --> 01:07:33,913
Depending on if we strike a deal or go
to trial, it may be as low as $20,000...

846
01:07:34,084 --> 01:07:38,427
...and it could run nicely to 75,
exclusive of appeals.

847
01:07:38,595 --> 01:07:41,912
If the trial looks hopeless,
we'll be waiting for a guilty verdict...

848
01:07:42,083 --> 01:07:45,858
...and orchestrating everything
toward an appeal, a real possibility.

849
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:49,795
- A guilty verdict is a real possibility?
- That's why there's no bail.

850
01:07:49,956 --> 01:07:53,785
Running at the scene. He also refuses
to divulge the name of his partners.

851
01:07:54,179 --> 01:07:56,284
The judge won't be lenient.

852
01:07:56,451 --> 01:08:00,412
I must say, for a middle-class boy, your
son's values seem a bit misdirected.

853
01:08:00,579 --> 01:08:04,376
My grandson's not middle class
and never has been.

854
01:08:04,547 --> 01:08:07,264
The D. A.'s anxious to strike a deal.
That's a positive.

855
01:08:07,427 --> 01:08:10,111
The company isn't screaming
for blood, which is unusual.

856
01:08:10,499 --> 01:08:11,841
Why aren't they?

857
01:08:12,003 --> 01:08:14,108
They don't want to put Adam
on the cross.

858
01:08:14,275 --> 01:08:17,755
The bottom line is if Adam will deliver
his partners and the plasmids...

859
01:08:17,923 --> 01:08:20,705
...they're talking minimum jail time,
maybe six months.

860
01:08:20,867 --> 01:08:24,828
Mind you, that's for openers. They'll go
for zero jail time at the drop of a hat.

861
01:08:25,251 --> 01:08:27,487
- I see.
- They wanna make a rat out of him.

862
01:08:27,651 --> 01:08:29,822
Hey, mister, he's your grandson.

863
01:08:29,986 --> 01:08:32,442
- I was talking to him.
- I can hear it.

864
01:08:32,643 --> 01:08:35,032
Please. What if Adam holds out,
gives no one up...

865
01:08:35,203 --> 01:08:38,050
...won't say where the plasmids are?
- They'll crucify him.

866
01:08:38,434 --> 01:08:43,323
You can't stand in front of a judge in
the United States and say, "Fuck you."

867
01:08:43,490 --> 01:08:45,498
They won't tolerate it.

868
01:08:45,666 --> 01:08:47,008
What does crucify mean?

869
01:08:47,170 --> 01:08:51,065
When they finish adding burglary-one
charges, assaulting the guards...

870
01:08:51,235 --> 01:08:54,268
...you're looking at two
14-year sentences, consecutive...

871
01:08:54,434 --> 01:08:55,808
...which the judge can do.

872
01:08:55,970 --> 01:08:59,996
I would appeal it since both charges
stem from the same crime...

873
01:09:00,291 --> 01:09:03,160
...but I wouldn't hold my breath
until it's overturned.

874
01:09:03,330 --> 01:09:07,159
If your son, and your grandson,
Mr. McMullen...

875
01:09:07,330 --> 01:09:11,803
...behaves perfectly, tutors his fellow
cons with remedial-reading problems...

876
01:09:11,970 --> 01:09:17,949
...he could be out in 15 years,
a bit shy of his 40th birthday.

877
01:09:21,730 --> 01:09:23,256
We need a few minutes.

878
01:09:23,426 --> 01:09:24,703
Come on.

879
01:09:24,866 --> 01:09:27,200
Fifteen years! Did you hear
what she said?

880
01:09:27,362 --> 01:09:31,672
We take the logbook and the
plasmids, and we turn ourselves in.

881
01:09:31,841 --> 01:09:35,900
- We take this step by step.
- Fuck that! I've been through that.

882
01:09:36,065 --> 01:09:39,414
That means Jessie McMullen first!
That's my kid in there, man.

883
01:09:39,586 --> 01:09:42,684
Adam can manage 48 hours
in a suburban jail.

884
01:09:42,849 --> 01:09:47,104
Adam will not spend one more
fucking hour in any fucking jail!

885
01:09:47,265 --> 01:09:50,200
- Didn't you hear her? Did you hear?
- Keep your voice down.

886
01:09:50,369 --> 01:09:52,376
You are not listening to me.
Listen to me!

887
01:09:52,545 --> 01:09:56,123
You don't fucking listen to what I say!

888
01:10:02,529 --> 01:10:06,784
- That's you... Hey.
- What?

889
01:10:11,584 --> 01:10:14,301
- Adam's my grandson.
- Yeah.

890
01:10:14,464 --> 01:10:17,879
- Would I hurt him?
- I don't know. Would you, Jessie?

891
01:10:18,304 --> 01:10:20,857
- I'll tell you what.
- What?

892
01:10:22,464 --> 01:10:25,596
- Hold still.
- I cut myself shaving.

893
01:10:29,217 --> 01:10:34,302
You go visit him, and I'll settle up
with this fucking shyster.

894
01:10:38,848 --> 01:10:41,020
No, no. I'll settle
with the fucking shyster.

895
01:10:41,185 --> 01:10:43,999
I'll settle with that fucking...
Don't you worry.

896
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:48,154
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

897
01:11:04,639 --> 01:11:07,094
Did you see a white Caddy here?
A white Fleetwood?

898
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:10,297
Yeah, some old guy just drove it out.

899
01:11:12,608 --> 01:11:14,463
Where do you get a taxi around here?

900
01:11:14,624 --> 01:11:16,566
- Not around here.
- I need a fucking taxi.

901
01:11:16,736 --> 01:11:19,070
Get me a fucking taxi. Taxi!

902
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:22,494
- How you doing?
- I'm okay.

903
01:11:22,656 --> 01:11:25,372
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

904
01:11:26,111 --> 01:11:27,769
If things don't improve, Adam...

905
01:11:27,935 --> 01:11:31,034
...your father will want us
to turn ourselves in with the stuff.

906
01:11:31,199 --> 01:11:33,469
That's bullshit.

907
01:11:33,632 --> 01:11:34,842
It means you walk.

908
01:11:35,359 --> 01:11:39,515
Yeah, the lawyer gave me
that 15 years in prison spiel too.

909
01:11:39,679 --> 01:11:42,330
She's just pumping her fee up.

910
01:11:42,495 --> 01:11:45,429
I won't do more than a year, tops.

911
01:11:45,855 --> 01:11:48,921
I can do that. You did it. Dad did it.

912
01:11:49,087 --> 01:11:51,291
He doesn't have the confidence
in me to do it.

913
01:11:51,455 --> 01:11:54,237
Don't kid yourself it's gonna be easy.

914
01:11:55,039 --> 01:11:59,447
Somebody once told me it builds
character, like a hitch in the Army.

915
01:11:59,614 --> 01:12:02,003
You still have the plasmids?

916
01:12:02,175 --> 01:12:03,353
Yeah, on ice.

917
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:05,595
- And the logbook?
- Yeah.

918
01:12:05,759 --> 01:12:09,850
Well, then Jimmy Chiu will still pay
us the million bucks.

919
01:12:10,334 --> 01:12:12,309
We spend $ 100,000 on my defense...

920
01:12:12,479 --> 01:12:16,407
...and we still get to keep
$300,000 a piece.

921
01:12:18,974 --> 01:12:21,113
You're a McMullen.

922
01:12:36,190 --> 01:12:37,782
Adam McMullen.

923
01:12:37,950 --> 01:12:41,212
- You his lawyer?
- I'm his father.

924
01:12:41,534 --> 01:12:44,501
One visitor a day.
He's already had one.

925
01:12:44,670 --> 01:12:46,263
Who?

926
01:12:47,774 --> 01:12:50,108
Jessie McMullen.

927
01:13:00,349 --> 01:13:03,961
Jessie, if you're in there,
open the fucking door!

928
01:13:27,709 --> 01:13:29,564
Is he here?

929
01:13:29,725 --> 01:13:33,108
- Is he here? Don't lie to me. - You're
gonna foot the bill for that chain.

930
01:13:33,277 --> 01:13:35,165
Is he here?

931
01:13:35,964 --> 01:13:38,747
You're an emotional bunch,
you McMullens.

932
01:13:39,965 --> 01:13:41,306
I didn't mean to do that.

933
01:13:41,468 --> 01:13:43,061
You could have asked to come in.

934
01:13:43,229 --> 01:13:46,196
What the hell is wrong
with your family?

935
01:13:47,580 --> 01:13:51,060
What's wrong with my family
is my lunatic father.

936
01:13:52,829 --> 01:13:54,520
Here.

937
01:13:58,845 --> 01:14:00,601
You don't seem surprised to see me.

938
01:14:00,765 --> 01:14:04,442
- Well, I try to take life as it comes.
- Yeah?

939
01:14:07,740 --> 01:14:10,129
What are you supposed to tell me?

940
01:14:12,540 --> 01:14:14,995
He tell you I might show up?

941
01:14:16,156 --> 01:14:17,880
Yeah.

942
01:14:18,044 --> 01:14:20,216
He tell you what for?

943
01:14:20,860 --> 01:14:23,031
- He tell you?
- He said you had a falling out.

944
01:14:23,196 --> 01:14:26,938
A falling out? That fuck calls
this a "falling out"?

945
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:29,882
I take it he understated the case.

946
01:14:30,588 --> 01:14:32,213
What are you supposed to tell me?

947
01:14:32,380 --> 01:14:34,998
- That he's out of town, which he is.
- Yeah? Yeah.

948
01:14:35,164 --> 01:14:38,677
And that what you're looking for
isn't here, which it isn't.

949
01:14:38,844 --> 01:14:40,218
And it's not at his place.

950
01:14:40,379 --> 01:14:43,892
He said you'd be smart enough
to know that without asking.

951
01:15:07,195 --> 01:15:11,090
- What the hell are you looking for?
- Don't worry about it.

952
01:15:15,483 --> 01:15:16,760
What do you mean?

953
01:15:16,923 --> 01:15:20,600
Do you think it would be
like your father to tell me?

954
01:15:26,458 --> 01:15:30,997
Jessie and me and Adam
did a fancy burglary.

955
01:15:31,162 --> 01:15:35,603
We got goods worth a ton of money,
and Adam got dropped coming out.

956
01:15:36,378 --> 01:15:40,535
My son, Jessie's grandson, is
now sitting up in Nassau County...

957
01:15:40,699 --> 01:15:43,252
...looking at 15 years behind...

958
01:15:45,082 --> 01:15:47,952
Behind bars. 15 years in a cage.

959
01:15:50,458 --> 01:15:53,011
If the goods are returned...

960
01:15:54,458 --> 01:15:56,596
...and me and Jessie...

961
01:15:57,883 --> 01:16:00,817
...turn ourselves in, Adam walks.

962
01:16:01,722 --> 01:16:04,788
But while my back was turned...

963
01:16:04,954 --> 01:16:07,988
...Jessie made off with the goods.

964
01:16:11,354 --> 01:16:13,590
I don't believe you.

965
01:16:13,914 --> 01:16:18,485
You know, I've been around thieves.
That's how I came upon your father.

966
01:16:18,650 --> 01:16:21,585
I married one of the better
counterfeiters on the East Coast.

967
01:16:21,754 --> 01:16:24,536
I know the score, okay?
I'm a knockaround girl.

968
01:16:24,698 --> 01:16:28,527
You and Jessie wanna rob, go ahead,
but how could you take Adam along?

969
01:16:28,698 --> 01:16:30,934
I went along to...

970
01:16:31,097 --> 01:16:32,504
To look out for him.

971
01:16:32,665 --> 01:16:34,607
Bullshit.

972
01:16:34,777 --> 01:16:38,389
You enjoyed every minute of it.
All you guys do.

973
01:16:43,098 --> 01:16:45,432
Why not turn yourself in?

974
01:16:51,257 --> 01:16:53,232
Without the goods, it's useless.

975
01:17:15,033 --> 01:17:17,367
Jesus, thank you.

976
01:17:28,632 --> 01:17:33,683
Why don't you just tell Jessie that I,
you know, smacked you around, okay?

977
01:17:34,072 --> 01:17:37,236
I'll tell him to go cut his fucking wrists.

978
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:39,822
Get that kid out of jail.
I'll take care of myself.

979
01:17:39,993 --> 01:17:41,040
I'm trying.

980
01:17:43,512 --> 01:17:44,974
- I'll get it.
- Hello.

981
01:17:45,144 --> 01:17:46,999
Just a moment.

982
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:49,778
It's for you. It's a woman.

983
01:17:49,944 --> 01:17:52,213
- Hello.
- You start playing straight with me...

984
01:17:52,375 --> 01:17:54,710
...or your son's gonna rot in jail.

985
01:17:54,872 --> 01:17:56,497
- What?
- Water.

986
01:17:56,664 --> 01:18:00,821
You gave me eight vials of tap water.

987
01:18:01,688 --> 01:18:02,800
What are you saying?

988
01:18:03,064 --> 01:18:06,675
I said, you gave me
eight vials of tap water!

989
01:18:12,183 --> 01:18:14,485
What's wrong? Who was that?

990
01:18:14,648 --> 01:18:15,989
It's...

991
01:18:17,303 --> 01:18:18,961
It's about Adam.

992
01:18:19,127 --> 01:18:20,883
- Oh, God.
- No, no, he's not hurt.

993
01:18:21,047 --> 01:18:23,055
He's...

994
01:18:26,103 --> 01:18:27,761
He's been arrested.

995
01:18:27,927 --> 01:18:30,164
A burglary...

996
01:18:31,224 --> 01:18:33,874
Upstate. It's...

997
01:18:34,103 --> 01:18:37,038
- A burglary?
- Well, it's pretty serious.

998
01:18:37,207 --> 01:18:39,628
How did Adam get...?

999
01:18:39,799 --> 01:18:42,450
What is Adam doing involved
in a burglary, Vito?

1000
01:18:42,615 --> 01:18:44,819
How did he...?

1001
01:18:46,199 --> 01:18:47,857
Jessie was involved in it.

1002
01:18:50,007 --> 01:18:51,763
Jessie.

1003
01:18:58,614 --> 01:18:59,824
I'm gonna kill him.

1004
01:19:01,206 --> 01:19:03,029
I wanna kill that son of a bitch.

1005
01:19:06,518 --> 01:19:08,853
I was part of it too.

1006
01:19:11,062 --> 01:19:13,102
I went along to look out for Adam.

1007
01:19:13,878 --> 01:19:16,114
But he would have gone anyway...

1008
01:19:16,278 --> 01:19:20,501
...so I went along to look out
for him. See?

1009
01:19:20,662 --> 01:19:23,957
- What are you telling me?
- It was the three of us.

1010
01:19:25,718 --> 01:19:31,020
The three of us, me and Jessie
and Adam. And Adam got caught.

1011
01:19:39,734 --> 01:19:43,149
- Well, where's Jessie now?
- I don't know.

1012
01:19:50,198 --> 01:19:52,107
You turn him in.

1013
01:19:53,078 --> 01:19:54,736
Yeah. What?

1014
01:19:56,054 --> 01:19:57,199
And yourself too.

1015
01:19:59,925 --> 01:20:04,181
And you explain to the judge
how a boy like Adam couldn't resist...

1016
01:20:08,469 --> 01:20:11,666
...following his father
and his grandfather into this madness.

1017
01:20:16,053 --> 01:20:17,842
You get my son out of jail, Vito...

1018
01:20:23,829 --> 01:20:27,790
...or I'll turn you and your stinking
father over to the police.

1019
01:20:48,212 --> 01:20:50,579
Where you going? Where you going?

1020
01:20:50,740 --> 01:20:52,366
- I want the plasmids.
- What?

1021
01:20:52,533 --> 01:20:55,347
You switched the plasmids.
What you got in there?

1022
01:20:55,508 --> 01:20:58,356
- You gave me fucking water!
- None of your fucking business.

1023
01:20:58,516 --> 01:21:01,418
What do you got in there?
Give me it! Open the fucking box!

1024
01:21:01,589 --> 01:21:04,306
Open the box! Give it to me!
Don't make me do something.

1025
01:21:04,469 --> 01:21:07,218
Don't you understand?
I don't have the fucking plasmids!

1026
01:21:13,524 --> 01:21:15,858
Welcome home, Vito. Here!

1027
01:21:16,692 --> 01:21:18,285
I know you fucking switched them.

1028
01:21:18,452 --> 01:21:21,321
You didn't get as far from
Hell's Kitchen as you thought.

1029
01:21:21,492 --> 01:21:22,921
All right, where are they?

1030
01:21:23,092 --> 01:21:25,874
- I'm telling you the truth.
- You never told me the truth.

1031
01:21:26,036 --> 01:21:26,985
Well, I am now.

1032
01:21:27,156 --> 01:21:29,742
You spout about family and loyalty,
and it's all crap.

1033
01:21:29,908 --> 01:21:32,625
Stop whining about your childhood.

1034
01:21:32,788 --> 01:21:35,657
You sound like every asshole
on the television talk show.

1035
01:21:35,828 --> 01:21:38,827
You're 43 years old,
for chrissakes! Here!

1036
01:21:38,995 --> 01:21:40,937
He was fine till you got ahold of him.

1037
01:21:41,107 --> 01:21:43,016
- Fine?
- And I would have been fine too.

1038
01:21:43,187 --> 01:21:46,700
Fine. That poor kid doesn't know
his ass from a hole in the ground.

1039
01:21:46,867 --> 01:21:49,518
It's no wonder, the kind
of fucking father you've been.

1040
01:21:49,684 --> 01:21:51,374
- The kind of father I've been?
- Yes.

1041
01:21:51,539 --> 01:21:55,467
The kind of father I've been?!
What is this, some kind of fucking joke?

1042
01:21:55,635 --> 01:21:57,937
You're all ass-backwards
with that kid...

1043
01:21:58,099 --> 01:22:00,946
...tiptoeing around, hoping he's gonna
pat you on the head.

1044
01:22:01,107 --> 01:22:04,403
That's right. The kid that I steered
into being a Westinghouse Scholar.

1045
01:22:04,563 --> 01:22:06,930
You spend your life talking
"Westinghouse Scholar."

1046
01:22:07,091 --> 01:22:09,873
- Well, what's the matter with that?
- It's all bullshit.

1047
01:22:10,163 --> 01:22:12,399
And Adam knows it better
than any of us.

1048
01:22:12,563 --> 01:22:15,858
Now why do you think he set
this whole thing up?

1049
01:22:16,307 --> 01:22:18,860
Because he can smell the real Vito!
That's why.

1050
01:22:19,539 --> 01:22:22,735
- Smell what?
- This Vito.

1051
01:22:22,898 --> 01:22:25,932
This Vito. That's the real Vito.

1052
01:22:26,355 --> 01:22:28,460
That's the one he wants respect from.

1053
01:22:28,627 --> 01:22:31,048
Do you understand?

1054
01:22:33,906 --> 01:22:37,222
No one at home.
You're a fucking lost cause.

1055
01:22:39,730 --> 01:22:42,218
And look at the mess you've made.

1056
01:22:50,770 --> 01:22:53,836
I'm gonna give you up.
Did you hear what I said?

1057
01:22:54,002 --> 01:22:58,225
- I'm gonna give you up.
- Up yours, you fucking guinea midget.

1058
01:23:04,977 --> 01:23:05,926
Water!

1059
01:23:43,697 --> 01:23:45,420
What the hell?!

1060
01:23:45,585 --> 01:23:48,782
I'm Adam McMullen's granddad.

1061
01:23:50,065 --> 01:23:54,538
So the company's put you
back on the payroll.

1062
01:23:54,705 --> 01:23:58,927
At first, I couldn't figure
why they weren't screaming louder.

1063
01:23:59,088 --> 01:24:00,233
I'm gonna call security.

1064
01:24:00,401 --> 01:24:06,598
I've got the logbook and the tubes
of water. You want we go public?

1065
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:14,765
Then it was water we took
out of your lab.

1066
01:24:18,833 --> 01:24:22,280
Tell me, what was it?

1067
01:24:22,448 --> 01:24:24,685
An insurance scam?

1068
01:24:28,048 --> 01:24:31,626
No? Well, you got one big piece
of luck in all this.

1069
01:24:32,976 --> 01:24:34,765
What's that?

1070
01:24:34,928 --> 01:24:36,357
That I can be bought.

1071
01:24:38,416 --> 01:24:40,423
Why don't you tell me the story,
Wong?

1072
01:24:40,752 --> 01:24:43,567
- The name's Jimmy.
- Jimmy.

1073
01:24:44,048 --> 01:24:45,641
It's not about insurance.

1074
01:24:45,808 --> 01:24:46,855
No?

1075
01:24:47,024 --> 01:24:49,446
We've been promising
this new discovery for a year.

1076
01:24:49,615 --> 01:24:52,485
We dug a hole for ourselves.

1077
01:24:53,584 --> 01:24:57,097
Goddamned thing always looked
a week away.

1078
01:24:57,264 --> 01:24:58,638
Never worked.

1079
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:00,589
It's a tough game, science, isn't it?

1080
01:25:02,511 --> 01:25:06,854
We've just gone public,
an $80 million offering.

1081
01:25:07,024 --> 01:25:11,628
The financial community has valued
this company based on this discovery...

1082
01:25:12,207 --> 01:25:15,404
...and your burglary buys us
six more months development time.

1083
01:25:15,568 --> 01:25:21,231
So long as the logbook and
the plasmids are never ever recovered.

1084
01:25:21,392 --> 01:25:24,741
That's what you had in mind
in the first place, wasn't it?

1085
01:25:37,295 --> 01:25:39,117
Police. Freeze.

1086
01:25:39,279 --> 01:25:41,800
Keep your hands
over your head.

1087
01:25:42,479 --> 01:25:43,788
Cut that crap out.

1088
01:25:43,951 --> 01:25:46,765
Hi, Charlie. It's been a long time.
Where's the beef here?

1089
01:25:46,927 --> 01:25:49,709
- Hey, where are you going?
- It's all legal.

1090
01:25:49,871 --> 01:25:51,878
What's he got there?

1091
01:25:55,566 --> 01:25:59,396
Vito. He ratted you out, Jessie.

1092
01:26:05,422 --> 01:26:07,724
I didn't think he'd do it.

1093
01:26:09,262 --> 01:26:11,651
Does the State have anything to add
to the report?

1094
01:26:11,822 --> 01:26:13,131
- No, Your Honor.
- Counselor?

1095
01:26:13,294 --> 01:26:14,242
No, sir.

1096
01:26:14,414 --> 01:26:18,026
Would the young Mr. McMullen like
to say something on his own behalf?

1097
01:26:18,190 --> 01:26:22,794
No, Your Honor, I would like to say
something on my grandfather's behalf.

1098
01:26:24,398 --> 01:26:26,187
Go ahead.

1099
01:26:29,262 --> 01:26:33,058
My grandfather has always tried
to take care of me.

1100
01:26:35,438 --> 01:26:38,885
I know that he didn't cooperate
with the police here...

1101
01:26:39,053 --> 01:26:41,770
...but that's because I didn't
want him to.

1102
01:26:42,318 --> 01:26:45,351
He's always respected my wishes.

1103
01:26:45,998 --> 01:26:48,932
He's always respected who I am.

1104
01:26:50,381 --> 01:26:54,953
And whatever's written
in those reports can't show it.

1105
01:26:56,430 --> 01:26:59,299
My grandpa loves me.

1106
01:26:59,597 --> 01:27:01,386
He always has.

1107
01:27:01,549 --> 01:27:03,622
And I love him.

1108
01:27:04,814 --> 01:27:08,326
This whole thing, Your Honor,
it wasn't his idea.

1109
01:27:08,685 --> 01:27:10,856
It was mine.

1110
01:27:14,221 --> 01:27:16,588
Duly noted. Counselor.

1111
01:27:19,724 --> 01:27:22,375
I've known Jessie McMullen
for 35 years and...

1112
01:27:22,541 --> 01:27:27,014
In how many of the arrests in McMullen's
career have you represented him?

1113
01:27:27,981 --> 01:27:30,250
More than a few, Your Honor.

1114
01:27:30,413 --> 01:27:33,282
Jessie McMullen
is a man in his 60s.

1115
01:27:33,453 --> 01:27:36,136
Any sentence, other than a token...

1116
01:27:36,300 --> 01:27:38,667
...would really be a life sentence,
Your Honor.

1117
01:27:38,828 --> 01:27:43,782
To give him five or 10 years in prison
is not a five- Or a 10-year sentence...

1118
01:27:45,229 --> 01:27:49,222
...it's a sentence of life imprisonment.

1119
01:27:53,069 --> 01:27:55,524
Vito McMullen.

1120
01:27:58,573 --> 01:28:00,939
Had you not finally showed
some decency...

1121
01:28:01,101 --> 01:28:04,897
...by turning in your father,
I would have put you away for five years.

1122
01:28:06,284 --> 01:28:10,408
You're a sorry excuse for a parent.
Three years of supervised probation.

1123
01:28:14,476 --> 01:28:16,516
Adam McMullen.

1124
01:28:17,452 --> 01:28:20,135
The company's intervention
would count for little with me...

1125
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:22,853
...it does seem, however,
to count with the prosecution...

1126
01:28:23,020 --> 01:28:27,689
...and I am going to go along reluctantly
with the plea bargain arrangement.

1127
01:28:27,852 --> 01:28:32,903
Being guilty of a Class A misdemeanor,
you are sentenced to 5 years probation.

1128
01:28:34,507 --> 01:28:38,217
These background reports convinced me
there were mitigating circumstances.

1129
01:28:39,852 --> 01:28:42,023
Jessie McMullen.

1130
01:28:49,515 --> 01:28:51,303
I have devoted most of my thinking...

1131
01:28:51,467 --> 01:28:54,369
...to how the court should treat
Jessie McMullen.

1132
01:28:55,179 --> 01:28:58,976
If there is a culprit in this case,
you certainly fit the bill.

1133
01:28:59,339 --> 01:29:03,081
You've never seen fit to produce
the stolen plasmids or the logbook.

1134
01:29:03,243 --> 01:29:05,382
You've also held up
the development...

1135
01:29:05,547 --> 01:29:09,344
...of an important new scientific
discovery from six months to a year.

1136
01:29:09,770 --> 01:29:12,007
But as your lawyer points out,
you're not young.

1137
01:29:12,171 --> 01:29:15,684
It's not an easy matter to decide on
a sentence for someone of your years.

1138
01:29:16,619 --> 01:29:18,986
I've had to think this out carefully.

1139
01:29:22,539 --> 01:29:24,808
For armed robbery, 15 years.

1140
01:29:24,971 --> 01:29:27,360
For burglary in the first degree,
10 years.

1141
01:29:27,531 --> 01:29:29,353
Sentences to run concurrently.

1142
01:29:44,075 --> 01:29:45,863
Grandpa.

1143
01:29:46,602 --> 01:29:48,390
Hey...

1144
01:29:48,554 --> 01:29:52,132
...if you can't do the time,
don't do the crime.

1145
01:29:54,954 --> 01:29:56,547
Jessie.

1146
01:29:59,850 --> 01:30:01,443
Ray.

1147
01:30:05,898 --> 01:30:09,095
Hey, you baldheaded prick.

1148
01:30:09,674 --> 01:30:12,325
Don't you ever get caught
on the take...

1149
01:30:12,489 --> 01:30:18,206
...because if you end up in any joint
I'm in, you'll leave feet first.

1150
01:30:22,537 --> 01:30:25,701
You come by every month or so,
you hear?

1151
01:30:26,154 --> 01:30:28,488
When do they ship you out?

1152
01:30:28,649 --> 01:30:30,820
Today or tomorrow.

1153
01:30:32,041 --> 01:30:35,718
- I'll come every two weeks.
- Every month is fine.

1154
01:30:36,233 --> 01:30:40,357
- Gonna be tough?
- For me? No.

1155
01:30:40,521 --> 01:30:44,383
You pick out a tough guy, kick his ass
right away, give him a real good beating.

1156
01:30:44,553 --> 01:30:47,106
Word gets around,
and it makes your time easier.

1157
01:30:48,905 --> 01:30:54,022
- They don't put you in solitary?
- No, nobody wants trouble.

1158
01:30:54,377 --> 01:31:00,127
So you do it out of sight, no one
asks questions, the story is, "He fell."

1159
01:31:01,513 --> 01:31:03,717
I'll see you in a month.

1160
01:31:29,576 --> 01:31:34,943
I hear your kid fucked you over.
Tough way to start your time, Pop.

1161
01:31:36,616 --> 01:31:41,733
Now, why would he give a shit
whether I start my time tough or easy?

1162
01:31:41,896 --> 01:31:45,125
Hey, no big deal, Pop.
I mean, we all got some long bits to do.

1163
01:31:45,287 --> 01:31:49,826
And, you know, a little chitchat,
and time's half over before you know it.

1164
01:31:49,991 --> 01:31:52,926
That's the second time
you've called me "Pop."

1165
01:31:53,096 --> 01:31:56,445
I got around a lot when I was young,
but I doubt if I'm your father.

1166
01:31:56,615 --> 01:31:58,884
But who knows though?

1167
01:31:59,176 --> 01:32:01,859
You carry a picture of your mother?
Maybe I'll remember her.

1168
01:32:02,023 --> 01:32:03,933
I fucked half the whores
on the East Coast.

1169
01:32:04,295 --> 01:32:05,757
You fucking...

1170
01:32:15,944 --> 01:32:17,253
What happened?

1171
01:32:17,416 --> 01:32:19,270
He fell.

1172
01:32:26,727 --> 01:32:30,371
You know, Mom and Dad ask about you
all the time. You ought to call them.

1173
01:32:30,535 --> 01:32:32,674
I guess you visit
your grandfather a lot.

1174
01:32:32,839 --> 01:32:35,588
Yeah, every three or four weeks.

1175
01:32:36,166 --> 01:32:37,377
He's not doing so well.

1176
01:32:37,543 --> 01:32:41,154
I wouldn't worry about Jessie, Adam.
He's a real survivor.

1177
01:32:43,623 --> 01:32:46,470
You know, Adam, it's been six months.

1178
01:32:46,630 --> 01:32:48,037
Your father loves you, Adam.

1179
01:32:48,198 --> 01:32:51,198
Mom, I told you I don't want to
hear about him.

1180
01:32:51,367 --> 01:32:53,669
I mean this. The next time
you bring up his name...

1181
01:32:53,831 --> 01:32:57,060
...will be the last time
that you ever hear from me.

1182
01:33:03,366 --> 01:33:06,595
- I'll call you next week.
- Okay, sweetheart.

1183
01:33:13,030 --> 01:33:14,459
Adam.

1184
01:33:22,022 --> 01:33:26,779
Listen, God forbid one of us should get
hit by a truck tomorrow, you know?

1185
01:33:29,990 --> 01:33:33,023
Let's not let it happen
while we're still mad at each other.

1186
01:33:39,429 --> 01:33:41,698
You turned out to be...

1187
01:33:42,757 --> 01:33:45,310
...a piece of garbage.

1188
01:33:50,374 --> 01:33:53,472
Adam, Adam. So, what is your gripe?
What the fuck is your gripe?

1189
01:33:53,637 --> 01:33:54,914
- Gripe?
- Yeah.

1190
01:33:55,078 --> 01:33:57,281
- You turned in your father.
- I turned in my...

1191
01:33:57,445 --> 01:33:59,617
- He's your father!
- I turned myself in too.

1192
01:33:59,782 --> 01:34:01,691
- I turned us both in for you.
- Stop it!

1193
01:34:01,861 --> 01:34:03,290
- For you.
- Stop doing things for me!

1194
01:34:03,461 --> 01:34:05,403
What did I do that was so terrible?

1195
01:34:05,573 --> 01:34:07,907
I tried to give you a better
childhood than I had.

1196
01:34:08,070 --> 01:34:11,615
No, don't give me
the terrible childhood crap.

1197
01:34:12,485 --> 01:34:16,347
You had a lot more fun
as a kid than I ever did.

1198
01:34:16,773 --> 01:34:20,482
Jessie was fun, for chrissake.

1199
01:34:22,085 --> 01:34:25,881
He showed a lot more confidence in you
as a kid than you ever did in me.

1200
01:34:26,053 --> 01:34:30,177
He showed more respect for you
as a person...

1201
01:34:31,333 --> 01:34:33,820
...than you ever did for me.

1202
01:34:33,989 --> 01:34:36,575
- Come on.
- Get off.

1203
01:35:17,892 --> 01:35:20,859
You still got a grip of steel, huh?

1204
01:35:24,356 --> 01:35:28,098
You tell me I'm looking good,
I'll pop you on the nose.

1205
01:35:32,836 --> 01:35:36,251
- I screwed him okay.
- Who, Jessie?

1206
01:35:36,419 --> 01:35:40,675
I'm not even gonna do a year,
that baldheaded prick.

1207
01:35:43,843 --> 01:35:45,785
How are you doing?

1208
01:35:46,531 --> 01:35:48,833
I'm keeping out of trouble.

1209
01:35:50,531 --> 01:35:53,346
Sounds as bad as doing time.

1210
01:36:03,299 --> 01:36:05,688
You're a prince.

1211
01:36:15,202 --> 01:36:19,392
I'm sorry about the way
things turned out, Jessie.

1212
01:36:20,899 --> 01:36:23,834
You play the cards you're dealt.

1213
01:36:27,778 --> 01:36:30,112
I was damn lucky.

1214
01:36:30,978 --> 01:36:34,109
They could have put me away
for 10 years.

1215
01:36:48,386 --> 01:36:53,656
- Who got my charges reduced?
- The charges? Me.

1216
01:36:53,826 --> 01:36:58,615
I managed to squeeze a few lousy bucks
out of your Chinaman friend too.

1217
01:36:58,946 --> 01:37:02,012
I spent it, Adam, every nickel.

1218
01:37:02,337 --> 01:37:06,844
I thought about splitting it
with you, Adam. I really did.

1219
01:37:07,010 --> 01:37:09,017
Then I thought...

1220
01:37:09,186 --> 01:37:14,008
...if I'm gonna do the time,
I have a little vigorish coming to me.

1221
01:37:17,921 --> 01:37:20,343
So I figured the best thing...

1222
01:37:20,514 --> 01:37:22,302
...was just not to mention it.

1223
01:37:22,913 --> 01:37:26,874
- Even Vito couldn't argue with that.
- Vito.

1224
01:37:27,041 --> 01:37:28,950
Vito, a lost cause.

1225
01:37:31,009 --> 01:37:35,264
From the beginning, a lost cause.

1226
01:37:39,809 --> 01:37:42,330
You're your own man now, huh?

1227
01:37:45,921 --> 01:37:47,830
Well, I'm out from under Vito.

1228
01:37:48,545 --> 01:37:50,203
Good.

1229
01:37:51,904 --> 01:37:55,068
You think you can get out
from under me?

1230
01:38:03,809 --> 01:38:06,176
No, Mom, I don't wanna talk to him.

1231
01:38:06,337 --> 01:38:08,191
No, just tell him that...

1232
01:38:08,353 --> 01:38:10,425
That Jessie is dying.

1233
01:38:10,592 --> 01:38:14,301
They're moving him from the infirmary
into the prison hospital.

1234
01:38:14,881 --> 01:38:16,506
Yeah, just tell him.

1235
01:38:16,672 --> 01:38:19,389
Okay, bye.

1236
01:38:27,168 --> 01:38:30,812
I'm looking... Hi, I'm looking
for Jessie McMullen.

1237
01:38:30,976 --> 01:38:32,798
They just wheeled him out of here.

1238
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:35,229
- Which way?
- Won't do you no good.

1239
01:38:35,392 --> 01:38:37,497
Which way?!

1240
01:38:37,664 --> 01:38:40,566
Go back the way you came,
take the elevator to the basement.

1241
01:38:40,736 --> 01:38:42,711
Basement? To the basement.

1242
01:38:48,672 --> 01:38:51,389
Hey! Wait!

1243
01:38:51,552 --> 01:38:54,269
Is that Jessie McMullen?

1244
01:38:54,784 --> 01:38:56,245
Hey!

1245
01:38:56,512 --> 01:38:59,992
Please! Wait a minute,
don't shut the door.

1246
01:39:34,559 --> 01:39:36,086
- Hi, Ma.
- Hello.

1247
01:39:36,255 --> 01:39:38,589
- So?
- So it's so big I can't find anything.

1248
01:39:38,751 --> 01:39:40,726
- Hi, Papa. Hi.
- Hi, Rose.

1249
01:39:40,894 --> 01:39:41,843
Thank you.

1250
01:39:42,015 --> 01:39:45,310
- My first time in your new house.
- I'm sorry about your father, Vito.

1251
01:39:45,471 --> 01:39:49,148
I know. Hey, who have we got here?

1252
01:39:50,463 --> 01:39:52,251
Hiya, Nat.

1253
01:39:53,438 --> 01:39:55,773
It's all right, don't get up.

1254
01:40:02,206 --> 01:40:05,337
After 25 years, the shaygets
knows two Jewish words.

1255
01:40:05,502 --> 01:40:08,601
Well, you know.
Here, let me help you.

1256
01:40:18,494 --> 01:40:20,349
Time to let the angel in.

1257
01:40:20,510 --> 01:40:24,307
The angel won't have to squeeze
in under the chain.

1258
01:40:24,798 --> 01:40:29,107
I knew that was coming.
Your material is getting stale.

1259
01:40:31,357 --> 01:40:33,462
- Look who's here.
- Grandma.

1260
01:40:33,629 --> 01:40:37,786
I've been outside a half an hour waiting
for you to open the door for Elijah.

1261
01:40:56,861 --> 01:41:00,178
Anyway, they were thrilled that you
stopped by to see them.

1262
01:41:00,349 --> 01:41:03,830
Yeah, well, no reason to take
our problems out on them, huh?

1263
01:41:03,997 --> 01:41:06,844
Wait a minute, you gonna wait
for your mother to come down?

1264
01:41:07,005 --> 01:41:10,136
She'll be saying goodbye
for 20 minutes.

1265
01:41:10,301 --> 01:41:13,149
Plus, we'll just get in the same
old argument again.

1266
01:41:13,309 --> 01:41:14,869
What's the same old argument?

1267
01:41:16,988 --> 01:41:19,410
That everything you did,
you did for me.

1268
01:41:28,604 --> 01:41:32,914
If you hated the meat business
so much for 20 years...

1269
01:41:34,141 --> 01:41:37,556
...then I'm sorry, but stop blaming me.

1270
01:41:38,812 --> 01:41:40,372
You did it to yourself.

1271
01:41:49,821 --> 01:41:53,563
What's the most fun you've had
since you were a kid?

1272
01:41:54,972 --> 01:41:59,512
- What's the most fun I've had?
- Yeah, since you were a kid.

1273
01:42:01,756 --> 01:42:02,933
What?

1274
01:42:03,484 --> 01:42:04,793
The caper.

1275
01:42:04,956 --> 01:42:06,843
- The caper? The caper.
- Yeah.

1276
01:42:07,003 --> 01:42:08,826
Me too.

1277
01:42:10,684 --> 01:42:12,594
Oh, boy.

1278
01:42:12,892 --> 01:42:15,347
We are some family.

1279
01:42:18,748 --> 01:42:21,944
You know, the only time the three of us
ever had a drink together...

1280
01:42:22,107 --> 01:42:24,954
...was when we were
planning that robbery.

1281
01:42:28,316 --> 01:42:30,999
We are some family.

1282
01:42:34,780 --> 01:42:38,075
I brought back his ashes, Pop.

1283
01:42:39,515 --> 01:42:42,385
I thought that maybe the two of us...

1284
01:42:42,555 --> 01:42:45,589
...ought to bury him together.
- Thank you.

1285
01:42:46,747 --> 01:42:48,602
Thank you.

1286
01:42:54,971 --> 01:42:58,004
You have any idea
what we ought to do with him?

1287
01:43:00,219 --> 01:43:02,455
Yes, I do.

1288
01:43:04,154 --> 01:43:08,911
So, what are you gonna do now, Adam?
What do you want to do with your life?

1289
01:43:11,130 --> 01:43:15,669
- That's the first time you ever
asked that. - First time?

1290
01:43:16,378 --> 01:43:20,818
All right, I'll ask you a second time.
What do you wanna do with your life?

1291
01:43:20,986 --> 01:43:23,703
Well, now that you ask me...

1292
01:43:23,962 --> 01:43:25,904
...I don't know.

1293
01:43:26,490 --> 01:43:29,785
We lived in this building
when my mother died.

1294
01:43:30,266 --> 01:43:34,422
Right on that corner there,
Jessie pushed me into my first fight.

1295
01:43:35,994 --> 01:43:38,580
It's his neighborhood, okay.

1296
01:43:46,810 --> 01:43:49,079
Okay, now lift.

1297
01:43:49,242 --> 01:43:52,275
You've got to be kidding.

1298
01:43:58,138 --> 01:44:00,178
- Where do you want this keg?
- All the way up.

1299
01:44:00,345 --> 01:44:03,662
This is an open-air service.
Here we go.

1300
01:44:03,833 --> 01:44:07,095
I thought I told you guys
to get light beer.

1301
01:44:07,994 --> 01:44:12,369
If I'd have known this was a roof job,
I would have went for wristwatches.

1302
01:44:28,281 --> 01:44:31,445
I know! I know the Church
approves of cremation.

1303
01:44:31,609 --> 01:44:34,991
But it also approves of playing
the guitar at the Mass these days.

1304
01:44:35,161 --> 01:44:38,194
Vito, over the side with him.

1305
01:44:38,873 --> 01:44:42,256
Folks, hold it down, Jessie's going.

1306
01:44:42,553 --> 01:44:43,960
Quiet.

1307
01:44:47,033 --> 01:44:49,683
- Goodbye, Jessie.
- See you on the other side, Jessie.

1308
01:44:49,848 --> 01:44:52,020
So long, Jessie!

1309
01:44:52,184 --> 01:44:53,843
Goodbye!

1310
01:44:58,744 --> 01:45:00,915
I'm sorry, Adam.

1311
01:45:01,464 --> 01:45:03,220
For what?

1312
01:45:04,504 --> 01:45:06,544
I'm just sorry.

1313
01:45:09,880 --> 01:45:12,052
Well, me too.

1314
01:45:12,408 --> 01:45:14,416
I'm sorry too.

1315
01:46:15,063 --> 01:46:17,616
You know the words to this song?

1316
01:46:17,783 --> 01:46:20,533
I think I heard it once before.
