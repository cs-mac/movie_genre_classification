1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,074
.

2
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,910
What are you waiting in line for?

3
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,799
Michael Jackson is coming.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,877
Why are you standing here?

5
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:29,798
That question makes no sense.
Obviously, to guard the American star.

6
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:37,714
At 17:53, the personal jet of the American
star landed at Otopeni Airport in Romania.

7
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,394
Michael Jackson stepped out
of the airplane at 18:07,

8
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,149
and the 10,000 admirers
were in for a great disappointment.

9
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,712
The star received flowers
from 9 year-old twin girls,

10
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,155
waved and then left.

11
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,914
All that in 53 seconds.

12
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,750
Michael Jackson shot at
a stadium in Bucharest

13
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,207
a few memorable scenes
that will be included

14
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,397
in his future video,
"Police Walk".

15
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,636
Romanian policemen are extatic.

16
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,038
Michael Jackson is about to wear
a Romanian police uniform.

17
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,637
General Nitu is ordering,
"Do not overtake him ".

18
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,316
But who can, in fact,
overtake Michael Jackson?

19
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,435
Around 13:15 Michael Jackson was received
by president lon lliescu.

20
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,755
Living... Iiving...

21
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,073
Good afternoon. Di rector,
the boys is ready. Whenever.

22
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,998
OK, OK.

23
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:10,592
OF SNAlLS AND MEN

24
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,513
You'll be careful, OK?

25
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,159
OK, OK.

26
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,511
This vehicle has been our
livelihood for years.

27
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,719
It was a great achievement of our times.

28
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,437
We were the pride of this country.

29
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,116
We won the Paris-Dakar Rally with it.

30
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,116
Aro's prestige

31
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,355
is due to all of you,

32
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,149
who worked hard every day

33
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,876
so that the best cars would come out
of our production lines.

34
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,755
In this democratic transition process
that Romania is undergoing,

35
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,994
we can see that our sales went down.

36
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,680
Actually, this has happened
to the entire Romanian economy.

37
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,720
- Where the hell were you?
- I had something to do.

38
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,398
The hell you did.

39
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,353
We, the factory management,
and the ministry officials

40
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,998
decided to take the most drastic measures
in order to revive production.

41
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,631
Wait... hold on!

42
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,428
Our great Emil Cioran said...

43
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,595
For those who don't know, this means,

44
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:31,477
"To live eternity is to live day by day."

45
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,189
That's what we are going to do, damn it.

46
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,790
- You don't care about us!
- Look where you brought us!

47
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,799
Do you have a better idea?
You, with your union.

48
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,913
Tell us, here, in front of everyone.

49
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,028
I have been informed that a French group

50
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,150
have made a very interesting proposal.

51
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,871
They are coming today to
inspect our equipment.

52
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,509
Let us welcome them properly.

53
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,352
Hey! Shut up!

54
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,720
And stop by the cashier
for your last paychecks.

55
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,832
As of today,
the factory is being temporarily shut down.

56
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,675
Gica... Are we going to let them
make fools of us?

57
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,188
I would set his car on fire,
just like that, for eternity.

58
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,595
Cut it out, I'm talking now.

59
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,432
Eternite au jour le jour, what the hell?!

60
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,512
- It doesn't have any words.
- No, but it's a well-known piece.

61
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,194
It's Ravel's Bolero.
They're sure to recognize it.

62
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,712
I assure you, the guests will be impressed.
Yes, they will see we share their culture.

63
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,680
If the French don't recognize it,
we'll make fools of ourselves.

64
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,760
I'm sure they will recognize it.
There's no way they won't recognize it.

65
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,948
They know it not only in France,
but all over the world. It is a classic.

66
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,950
Whatever you want. It's all the same.

67
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,083
As long as we don't make
fools of ourselves.

68
00:06:38,096 --> 00:06:39,790
Oh well, whatever you want.

69
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,478
Goodbye, Director!

70
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,478
10, 20, 25, 26, 27,500. Here you are.

71
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,681
Boy, I'd really like to know
what that one's like in bed.

72
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,469
That one makes squeaky noises.
Like a mouse.

73
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,679
- And what about that one?
- That one...

74
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,748
She keeps her eyes closed all the time
and breathes hard, like she's sighing.

75
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,473
Get out of here.
You've been with her too?

76
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,113
That chick? She's bad, man.

77
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,759
She screams loud enough
to wake the neighborhood.

78
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,840
What would she scream?

79
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,550
Good afternoon!

80
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,994
Thank you!

81
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,519
- How about this one?
- This one, I don't know.

82
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,395
- These stay here.
- Did you like it?

83
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,748
French.

84
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,669
Manuela, you know it's important to make
a good impression on these French people.

85
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,837
They came all this way.

86
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,911
Please, come on.

87
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,838
Manuela, you've been making me hot
for such a long time.

88
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,918
What's the big deal?
It could be good for both of us.

89
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,830
Yes.

90
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,833
They left the hotel.

91
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:27,758
Yes, bring Mrs. Carmen as well.
OK, OK.

92
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,598
The Official Day of the Car Makers.

93
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,958
You're right.

94
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,359
Thank you.

95
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,993
Sorry!

96
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,468
My friends!

97
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,271
Welcome!

98
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,992
Mr. Director!

99
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,269
- Good afternoon, sir.
- My son, Olivier. He's working with me.

100
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,792
That's his son. His name is Olivier,
meaning, "olive tree".

101
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,064
Olive, as in the tree.
Pleased to meet you.

102
00:09:46,077 --> 00:09:48,152
We also have names
like Violet, Cherry...

103
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,237
- Just girl names.
- That's not true.

104
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,510
I have a brother-in-law
whose name is Pine.

105
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,994
Crazy people.

106
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,232
Coffee?

107
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,390
We' re very happy to be here
in this beautiful region.

108
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,234
He's glad to be here in
our beautiful country.

109
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,477
We have a beautiful country.
It rains a bit much here.

110
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,592
But it is beautiful,
and we also have beautiful girls.

111
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,673
We have a beautiful country.
It rains a bit much here.

112
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,519
But it is beautiful,
and we also have beautiful girls.

113
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,639
Of course!

114
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,950
- I brought you a small present.
- He brought you a small present.

115
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:29,350
This is from our factory in Pontarlier,
in Haut-Doubs.

116
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,757
That's also a beautiful region...
It rains often, just like here.

117
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,957
It's from their factory,
I don't know where.

118
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,475
I've never heard of the place.
But it's not Paris.

119
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,995
But he says it rains beautifully there,
just like here.

120
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,155
So this is our future. Yes, we produce,
we produce, we will adapt.

121
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,870
Here you can find as many of these
as you want after every rain.

122
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:53,472
The manager thanks you,
and there are a lot of snails here too.

123
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,599
With the rain, you know, snails...

124
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,156
- Even better!
- You can see on the back there's a recipe.

125
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:05,071
And the secret is a lot of butter and also
a lot of parsley and a lot of garlic.

126
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,238
Because the snail itself
doesn't have a lot of flavor.

127
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,233
After 10 minutes in a very hot oven,
it's impecable.

128
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:16,911
The secret is to add a lot of butter
and garlic, and parsley.

129
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,516
Yes, otherwise the snail
doesn't have much flavor.

130
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:24,077
And he's saying it's good. I heard that
too, there they pay good money for that.

131
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,469
It's a delicacy.

132
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,750
Delicacies... international.

133
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,269
I'll give them to my wife,
see what she can do with them.

134
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,434
My wife... my wife cooks.

135
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,113
The director's wife is a very good cook.

136
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,471
She will cook the snails very, very well.

137
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,873
- She does sarmale very, very well.
- Sarmale. Yes.

138
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,233
I am very glad you came to our small town.

139
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,110
We hope to make good business
with our French friends,

140
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,516
with our Latin brothers.

141
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,838
Good business for us,
good business for you.

142
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,151
- The director said...
- No, no, I understand.

143
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,238
He understands, he understands, of course.
My French is back.

144
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,638
Thank you, Mr. Director.

145
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:27,995
We also hope to do good business with our
Romanian friends, our Latin brothers.

146
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,597
So, I won't keep you any longer,
I know you are busy at school.

147
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,274
Sir, it is my pleasure.

148
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,313
You know I took half a
day off to translate.

149
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,029
I know, but I can manage in
the language of Voltaire, can't l?

150
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,879
I can still remember it from school.

151
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,868
I may not have a great accent,
but the words...

152
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,753
Don't worry, you speak very well.

153
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,192
What did he say?

154
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,824
This must be a quote from
a national writer...

155
00:13:08,837 --> 00:13:11,031
Ionesco, Popesco...
I don't remember.

156
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,193
Ah, the poet. Yes.

157
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,510
Yes, yes, yes. I'll leave you now.

158
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,838
Goodbye, gentlemen.
I hope you will visit our school soon.

159
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,915
We have prepared for you a little surprise.

160
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,277
Thank you, madam, thank you.

161
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,758
Make sure I am not disturbed.

162
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,751
Guys, I think we have to buy this factory.

163
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,116
If not, they'll be firing all of us.

164
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:40,349
What the hell, can't we just raise
150,000 dollars?

165
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,759
- Come on, Gica, are you nuts?
- Why?

166
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,110
- How the hell would we get all that money?
- We'll do something.

167
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,521
We don't even have a hundred dollars now.
Are you nuts?

168
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,834
We'll fiind a solution.

169
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,957
Guys, I found something in the paper.

170
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,358
Look... the richest man in the world
is the sultan of Brunei.

171
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,069
- Say what?
- The Sultan of Brunei.

172
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,598
Let's do something.
Let's write to him, maybe he'll help.

173
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,955
Yeah, right. We wrote to the people at the
Ministry and they didn't even write back,

174
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,469
and this guy will write to you...
what did you say his name was?

175
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,671
- The Sultan of Brunei.
- You can grab my ass.

176
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,192
Hey, hey, hey, wait.

177
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,992
Why shouldn't we write to him?
What's the problem?

178
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,553
What the hell is your problem?

179
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,830
This guy's right. We' re in serious
trouble and you're making fun.

180
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,393
Write it down, there.

181
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,070
What's 150,000 to him?
Dinner in a restaurant, right?

182
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,395
The tip.

183
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,989
He might want to help us,
to do a good deed.

184
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,710
Half?

185
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,076
Yes, the rest afterwards.

186
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,392
As discussed.

187
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,792
150.000 dollars.

188
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,151
Yes, as discussed, but with one condition.

189
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,280
We are in agreement.
The factory will be closed.

190
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:55,752
That's not a problem, I'll take care
of everything. Next week, bankrupture.

191
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,316
- Bank... rupture??
- Yes, the factory... done.

192
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,718
It will go bankrupt.

193
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,316
What will happen to the workers?

194
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,475
Yes, what will happen to the workers?

195
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,833
It's not a problem. I'll take care
of everything. Don't worry.

196
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:18,679
Robert, I'm a fox old.

197
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,876
Ah... old fox.

198
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,197
I've been here since Ceausescu's regime.

199
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,073
When I say produce, everyone produces.

200
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,755
When I say bankrupture, it's bankrupture.

201
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:41,075
Robert, do you think that I'm a...
papagal (parrot)?

202
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,870
Yes, those birds.

203
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,477
Ah, parrot.

204
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,473
Hey, Petrescu! Petrescu!

205
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,756
Yes?

206
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,190
Come here!

207
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,675
Good evening, sir.

208
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,871
What did you guys talk about,
there at the union meeting?

209
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,877
What do you think? We met and we tried
to think of some solutions.

210
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,036
Very good, boys. Come up with solutions.

211
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:13,068
I've had enough of claims.
And no more trouble, OK?

212
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,990
The French want to buy the plant
and reorganize things here...

213
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,474
- Good evening, Director!
- Good evening!

214
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,638
They will make a snail cannery here
and only keeping about 300 workers.

215
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,474
- It would be good to be one of them.
- What would I do with snails, Director?

216
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,676
- What?
- Do you think I'd go that low?

217
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,031
You have a wife and a kid and
there are hard times coming.

218
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,714
Listen to me. I went to school longer.

219
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,360
- Good evening, director.
- Hi, boys!

220
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,756
What the hell is wrong with it?

221
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,238
Easy, easy, Be gentle or else it'll choke.
We'll give you a push.

222
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,114
Release the gear.
Hey guys, come here!

223
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,039
Come here a minute! Let's help,
push here for the Director.

224
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,799
Come on, come on!

225
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,038
Get it out of gear.

226
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,192
Come on, harder!

227
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,069
Thank you for today's accomplishments!

228
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,640
We're waiting for you tomorrow
with strength and initiative!

229
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,956
- How are you, baby?
- Daddy!

230
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,199
- How are you?
- Look what I learned today.

231
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,355
- What is that?
- Bolero by Ravel.

232
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,158
Good work!

233
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,118
- You smell like perfume.
- It's from the French guys.

234
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,152
Was it a salary bonus, or what?

235
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,161
Those people came because
they want to buy us.

236
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,118
We'll see how many of us they get rid of
and how many will remain.

237
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,437
In the end, me and the boys thought

238
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,160
the only solution is to write
to the Sultan of Brunei.

239
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,675
- To help us buy the plant.
- Who?

240
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,189
The Sultan of Brunei.
He's the richest man in the world.

241
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,913
Can I write to the Sultan of Brunei?

242
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,275
What for?

243
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,590
To send me a bicycle.

244
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,510
Let him first answer us about the plant

245
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,157
Come on, dinner's ready.
And you go wash. You smell like a whore.

246
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,113
- French perfume. What do you want?
- Really...

247
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,357
- I told you the French came to the plant.
- Shut up.

248
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,795
You can smell them all the way home.

249
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,958
You're such a lousy liar.

250
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,910
A letter came for you.

251
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,234
To hell with them,
with their visas and everything.

252
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,672
Come on, forget it.

253
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,551
You can be happy here too.

254
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,197
They're just idiots.

255
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,311
Damn stupid!

256
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,671
Come on, Mama!

257
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,117
Come on, Mama! And please,
don't tell me about happiness again.

258
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,393
You know, it's not just a dog.
It's a noble breed.

259
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,989
I don't want a dog in my house.

260
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,758
Darling, it's a labrador.

261
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,996
Just like Dr. Teianu's dog.

262
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,999
Pufi, come on. Pufi, be nice with daddy.

263
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,952
Which Teianu? Who's Teianu?

264
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,799
The lady anaesthesist at the hospital,
whose son is in Paris.

265
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,960
- Come on, Pufii...
- No!

266
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:57,756
- Come on, say hello to Daddy.
- I don't want a dog! Get it out of here!

267
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,878
Come on Pufi, get out! Come on!

268
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,633
Pufi, stay here.

269
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,353
Take him away!
How much did it cost?

270
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,919
How much did it cost?

271
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,264
Drop it. It's not a problem.
It's a noble breed.

272
00:20:08,277 --> 00:20:10,432
His parents were
carefully selected.

273
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,148
- They're not stray dogs.
- How much did it cost?

274
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,918
- Almost nothing.
- How much?

275
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,955
15,000. That's not even 50 dollars.

276
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,876
- So tell me, isn't it worth it?
- 50 dollars? Have you gone crazy?

277
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,634
What? Didn't you say
that we can afford it now?

278
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,998
I did, but we can't afford it yet.
Wait at least a week, damn it!

279
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,754
Do you think I care about
the dog right now?

280
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:38,638
Come on, dear, don't argue with him.
You're waking up all the neighbors.

281
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:42,594
Mama, why are you not asleep at this hour?
Go on, go to sleep.

282
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,512
Do you want something to eat?

283
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,512
Snails.

284
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,873
What's that?

285
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,559
Snails.

286
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:57,394
You add butter, garlic
and a little parsley.

287
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,795
Then put them in the oven for 10 minutes.

288
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,913
It says here that the
oven must be very hot.

289
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,236
You' re not going to eat that, are you?

290
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,552
What are you saying? You have no idea.
This is refiined food.

291
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,711
I don't want dog in my house.

292
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,434
Out! Go on!

293
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,632
- Come on, Pufi!
- Shoo! Get him away from me.

294
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,235
Let's go, Pufi! Don't be upset.

295
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,436
Come with mommy!

296
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:34,317
In the last 3 years, since the wind
of freedom started to blow...

297
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:38,559
in our beloved country,
our entire lives have changed.

298
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,751
But now we have new
problems, new difficulties.

299
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,834
Problems we didn't face before.

300
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:56,479
As for the factory, our French partners
have an interesting program.

301
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:04,233
They will employ around 300 workers
for their future business...

302
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:12,751
You know, sitting here watching TV, that's
sure gonna take care of all our problems.

303
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,599
Perfect...

304
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,280
- Is Viorel asleep?
- Yes.

305
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,279
How are we going to raise our kid
if you're unemployed?

306
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,398
We can't live only on my
salary from the shop.

307
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,318
I'll fiind a solution.

308
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,949
You will find... Have you been looking?

309
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:41,037
No... I don't know... We'll manage.

310
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,792
The hell we will.
Don't you see how bad it...?

311
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:48,437
Leave it for now.
We won't find a solution at night.

312
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,873
Leave it, leave it, leave it.
That's all you ever say.

313
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,595
Are you a man full of energy?

314
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,428
Are you healthy and under 40?

315
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:04,912
Give a family the gift of hope
and get 50 dollars for yourself.

316
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:12,193
Call 230 5644 or write to us at the Pro
Family Foundation, PO Box 31, Bucharest.

317
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:29,838
How much is 50 ti mes 1 000 ti mes... 6?

318
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,871
Do you think I'm in the mood
for math lessons now?

319
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,917
Come on, l' m serious now.

320
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,389
If you' re serious,

321
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,711
how come you smelled like perfume
when you came home from the plant today?

322
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,912
Did you hear me? I'm talking to you.

323
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,758
Keep it down, you're waking up the kid.

324
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,558
How stupid do you think I am?

325
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,837
Were you with that bitch?

326
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,513
Tell me!

327
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,398
Cut it out! Cut it...

328
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,639
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
You're lying to me!

329
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,199
Easy!

330
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,237
I want you to tell me the truth.

331
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,235
I want you to tell me the truth.

332
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,429
We can't live like this.

333
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,797
We have a child to raise.
I want you to tell me the truth.

334
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,792
I' m telling you the truth...

335
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,631
Are you telling me the truth?

336
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,916
I' m telling you the truth.

337
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,439
Did you cheat on me?

338
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,515
No.

339
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,903
I understand. No physical
flaws, diseases...

340
00:24:56,916 --> 00:24:59,310
What did you say?

341
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:03,190
Cronic diseases... Or obesity.

342
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,079
I wrote that down.

343
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:10,195
So, you pay 50 dollars for every donation.

344
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,116
Yes. Good. Thank you!
Bye.

345
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:24,432
Hey, guys!
All of us, together, we can save the plant.

346
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,191
I' m telling you...

347
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:32,952
The plant, all the debts and a license
for the engine are worth 300,000 dollars.

348
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,596
If a thousand of us sell our sperm
for a week...

349
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,876
we collect 300,000 dollars in no time.

350
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,310
- What's that we're selling, again?
- Sperm.

351
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,115
An American clinic is buying sperm
for 50 dollars each.

352
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:54,036
I talked to them and they told me that in
one donation they collect 5 grams of sperm.

353
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,986
This means that 1 gram
costs about 10 dollars.

354
00:25:55,999 --> 00:25:57,755
The same as a gram of gold.

355
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,111
Don't tell me that you aren't able
to donate a gram of sperm.

356
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,437
If I put my mind to it,
I can donate 100 grams a night.

357
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,636
Get out of here, you're lying.

358
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,308
If my wife knew that I carry
such golden bars...

359
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,436
If you don't know, shut your mouth!

360
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,915
No way, Gica. Who's gonna buy that from us?

361
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,271
There's an American clinic in Bucharest.
I saw it last night on television.

362
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,277
I even called them.

363
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:26,556
50 dollars, times 1000 men times
6 days is 300,000... dollars.

364
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:30,438
We can even donate a few times a day.

365
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,359
We can even offer them a discount
and we finish sooner.

366
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,317
That's not possible. It's not true.

367
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,750
It's true. It says so in the paper. Look!

368
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:41,201
So why should we do it for the plant?
We might as well each do it for ourselves.

369
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,155
And what are you going
to do with 50 dollars?

370
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,986
You eat for a week in a
restaurant, or drink

371
00:26:45,999 --> 00:26:47,636
it in one night and
it's gone, right?

372
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,920
Look, if we all pitch in,
we can all buy the plant

373
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,798
and they can't kick us out of there.

374
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,040
Gica, you're crazy.
Is this what we do in the union?

375
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,878
Stop with the crap, Gica.

376
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,958
Stop right there.
I suggest we vote. Who's in favor?

377
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,119
Come on, guys.
We don't have another solution!

378
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,992
What do you mean
we don't have another solution?

379
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,077
I don't do such things,
I want to stay here in the factory.

380
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,641
The French promised us 300 places.

381
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,755
- 300?
- Yes.

382
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:17,316
Yes? And what about the others?
Come on, guys, let's vote!

383
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:20,153
What are we voting for? We're voting
to jerk ourselves off? Cut the crap.

384
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,351
OK, who is opposed?

385
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,796
OK. Who's abstaining?

386
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,684
Come on, guys, it's
not like the old times.

387
00:27:29,697 --> 00:27:31,192
George, are you nuts?

388
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,391
Don't you understand
that we want to stay on at the plant!

389
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,681
It's you who are nuts, guys.

390
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,035
They won't be able to keep all of you on.
Most will have to go.

391
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,441
Yeah, smartass, but maybe
we'll be among those who stay!

392
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,797
Yeah, lots of luck and good bye!
You have 10 percent chances, go...

393
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,469
Guys, let's try again.

394
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,473
Who's in favor?

395
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,917
Mirel, come on!

396
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,759
I can't. If my wife fiinds out
she'll break my legs.

397
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,080
And I don't even think
what you're saying is possible.

398
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,786
It is possible. I'll
show you that it works.

399
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,436
I'll go first.

400
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,916
How about Gheorghiu?

401
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,590
He's bad off, with 5 kids at home,
his wife works part-time...

402
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,438
I say keep him.

403
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:10,234
You thought right, he'll
be licking our boots.

404
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,834
Orghidan.

405
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,156
- Gheorghidan?
- No. Orghidan.

406
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,753
Who's that? Do you know him?

407
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,428
- I have no idea.
- The other column, then.

408
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:21,950
What?

409
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,199
They're going to what?

410
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,554
What? Are they nuts?

411
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,678
They made some calculations
and the math is right.

412
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:44,388
It's about 300,000 dollars.
How much is the plant worth?

413
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,510
The French are paying 150,000... but how
are they going to get all that money?

414
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,913
You know, I myself saw the advertisement
in the paper.

415
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,551
- Show it to me!
- Yes.

416
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,754
Wait! You'll show me when I get back.

417
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,871
I have to go to school.
The French are waiting for me.

418
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,479
And what do you want to do about the list?

419
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,520
You handle it
and show it to me when I get back.

420
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,313
Class, good afternoon!

421
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,637
- Good afternoon!
- Welcome. Here is the third grade.

422
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,799
They have prepared for
you a little surprise.

423
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,430
Children, are you ready? Viorel, please!

424
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,431
This evening, Club Paradise.

425
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,069
Please!
Come on, come on, Viorel!

426
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,072
1, 2, 3, and...

427
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,833
Come on, Viorel!

428
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,790
Viorel!

429
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,192
Oh, it's not so bad.
It's a song that I like very much.

430
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,350
And now, what will I do?

431
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,313
What will my life be like?

432
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:09,319
What about these days I don 't care about?
Now that you 're gone.

433
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:18,115
You see, it does have words.
What the hell...

434
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,868
What is my heart beating for?

435
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:26,435
Beating too fast, too fast.

436
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,996
Bingo.

437
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,915
Hello.

438
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,792
- Hello!
- You here?

439
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,109
May l?

440
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,679
Go ahead.

441
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,116
Thanks.

442
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,437
Hello. How many?

443
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,833
Th ree for me, please.

444
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,072
Here you go. 1 500.

445
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,438
- Same for me.
- Three?

446
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,197
40 cards for 500 lei.

447
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,598
The prize for a line is 800 lei.
The prize for bingo is 8000 lei.

448
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,319
The game is open.

449
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,630
The first number 1...

450
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,114
8...

451
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,799
72...

452
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,908
53...

453
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:48,910
31.

454
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,310
31!

455
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,069
I got it.

456
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,270
Thanks. I don't know how to play,
but...

457
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,753
75,

458
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,509
42,

459
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,075
90,

460
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,994
13,

461
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,109
43,

462
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,354
38,

463
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,359
13,

464
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,313
11.

465
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,875
Thanks!

466
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,118
- Line!
- Line!

467
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,992
We have a line on card number 1695...

468
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,394
Did we win?

469
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,355
Line.

470
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,510
Thanks!

471
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,439
The line prize was awarded,
we now go on to the bingo prize.

472
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,189
Man, do they wanna know a lot...

473
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,595
- They also want a photo.
- No way!

474
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,558
I've got some photos at home, but
they' re with my wife, on vacation.

475
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,796
And with my kid on his birthday.

476
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,998
Don't worry, Gica. We'll take some.
Some good ones.

477
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,668
- When?
- Right now. Mirel has his camera.

478
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,233
- Really?
- Come on, hand it over!

479
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,029
Tuck your belly in, man!

480
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,793
Put more cheese in that smile.

481
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,750
Way to go.

482
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,035
I don't know. Think about people in movies.

483
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,995
James Bond, correct?

484
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,679
Take that bloody photo already!

485
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,596
Hey!

486
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,754
Enough! Let's see what it says further on.

487
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,086
It is forbidden to
undertake any sexual

488
00:34:00,099 --> 00:34:02,475
activity in the days
preceding the collection.

489
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,869
What does that mean?

490
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,680
Well, yeah. Or else you're going
to get there without ammunition.

491
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,717
Why, you mean nothing?
Nothing? Not even, you know...

492
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,956
Yeah, like you get much anal anyway.

493
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,751
It doesn't say. You saw, though,
these people are serious, professionals.

494
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,632
Professionals, my ass.

495
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,632
Look! This one is easier.

496
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,195
What is your favorite kind of music?

497
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,754
I'll write down Dan Spataru.

498
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,121
- Which one from Dan Spataru?
- The one with the paths.

499
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:34,070
Our paths will cross some day...

500
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,276
- Gica!
- What? What?

501
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,710
Write down something else! Show off!

502
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,275
What would that be? Beethoven or what?

503
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,112
Beethoven is OK.

504
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,151
How do you spell it? With 2 e's?

505
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,034
Good afternoon!

506
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,474
Good afternoon.

507
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,672
You g rew so tall. And so handsome.

508
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:10,070
He looks just like his dad.
Do you like cotton candy?

509
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,150
Yes!

510
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,909
There you go, go buy yourself one
at the kiosk. Go on!

511
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,109
What do you say?

512
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,038
- Thank you!
- You're welcome.

513
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,315
Tell that husband of yours
to get his act together.

514
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,956
I'm not telling him anything.
You just mind your own business.

515
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,273
He's embarrassing you.

516
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,675
The whole town is talking.
It's a shame for this kid.

517
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,878
I'm not ashamed. He's doing his best
to keep us off the streets.

518
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,829
I'm not saying he's a bad guy,
but he went a little overboard.

519
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,712
Maybe if you tell him, he'll turn around.

520
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:51,556
We have to get along, damn it!
Like people do.

521
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,600
Come on, Viorel!
I have to go.

522
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,910
Take care. You never know
how these things end up.

523
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,114
- How are you?
- Fine. I'm going home.

524
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,833
What are you doing here?

525
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,918
I thought you were taking
classes in French.

526
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,759
Were you being funny?

527
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,361
That was hilarious.
You knocked me over with that joke.

528
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,198
I don't think it's funny.
What's in that head of yours?

529
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,550
You think you've got it made?

530
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,591
Planning to go away with that guy, or what?

531
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,675
What is your problem, really?
I thought we had a deal.

532
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,799
Now you're playing the detective with me?

533
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,515
I was just saying, it's a small town.
You can't keep a secret.

534
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,513
Was I wrong?

535
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,399
Since when are you lecturing me?

536
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:58,719
Let's get this straight.
You don't get to do that with me, OK?

537
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,872
You slept with him.

538
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:05,074
George, I do what I want, when I want to.
And you don't get to dictate a thing.

539
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,157
Yes? Understood?

540
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,235
Go home,
your wife and kid are waiting for you.

541
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,999
Hello!

542
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,553
Hello.

543
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,519
For you.

544
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,433
Thank you!

545
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,876
Please, come in.

546
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,990
- Is this you? In the picture?
- Yes.

547
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,399
That's funny.

548
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,639
Please, please!

549
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,589
No, no. Go in like that.

550
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,633
Mama, this is Mr. Olivier.

551
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,760
Good afternoon, madam.
Olivier, nice to meet you.

552
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,074
Hello.

553
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,004
What's wrong, dear?
Don't stand like that.

554
00:38:05,017 --> 00:38:06,552
Please, come in!

555
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,989
It's nice.

556
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:19,231
- Please, take a seat. Here.
- Thank you.

557
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,876
- Music?
- Yes.

558
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,756
Come! Sit!

559
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,633
Line.

560
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,629
That's my father.
He used to work at the plant, too.

561
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,310
- The plant.
- At the plant?

562
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,198
My father.

563
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,228
- Your father!
- Yes.

564
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,670
That's you next to him.

565
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,356
My father and my mother... this song...

566
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,114
Thank you!

567
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,798
Enjoy.

568
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,678
Cuckoo.

569
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,831
I have one in my home.

570
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,154
It's good.

571
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,911
Do you like Julio lglesias?

572
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:09,750
Yes.

573
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,514
Really?

574
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,557
Yes, I like him a lot.

575
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,872
- Do you speak Spanish?
- Yes. Of course.

576
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:24,155
Yes. I learned it because I wanted
to understand Julio's lyrics.

577
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,469
That's nice.

578
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,353
- What about you?
- No, no.

579
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:40,191
I studied at the Salvador Allende college
in Pontarlier.

580
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,743
The best kids in school
were learning German.

581
00:40:44,756 --> 00:40:47,150
But I learned Spanish.

582
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,509
Until now, it didn't help me.

583
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:54,190
- So... you were not a good student?
- No.

584
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,517
Would you like some more jam?

585
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,032
No, Mama, no.

586
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:03,112
Good marmelade, madam.
Thank you.

587
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,874
What is he saying about marmelade?

588
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,515
Tell him, dear, that this is jam.

589
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,360
You use the whole fruit
and it's harder to make.

590
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,437
He says it's very good, Mama.

591
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,472
Leave us alone, OK?

592
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,354
I would like to go out with you.

593
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,079
Do you want to?

594
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,508
- I can't.
- Why?

595
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:40,151
Because this is a small town. People talk.

596
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,990
It doesn't matter if they talk.

597
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,475
What would you like to do?

598
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,960
I don't know. You can't
do much around here.

599
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,912
What do you like most?

600
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,997
We can do whatever you want...

601
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,431
We can go
for a walk or eat something.

602
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,995
- I like to sing.
- Sing?

603
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,315
Yes, to sing.

604
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:12,518
There is a karaoke night
this week at Club Paradise.

605
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,109
- Karaoke?
- Yes. Karaoke.

606
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:23,838
If I get a proposition, of course.
But things are complicated.

607
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,792
There are others.

608
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:32,791
I came to get the list with the guys that
will be kept for the snail can factory.

609
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,883
I want the list with the
300 that will stay on.

610
00:42:39,896 --> 00:42:41,669
Did you hear me?

611
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,320
Do you want me to get the boys
and have a rally?

612
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,913
Do you really want a scandal?

613
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:51,317
What rally?
With whom? For whom?

614
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:55,192
Gica, there's no one working here anymore.

615
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,716
You'd better stick to your business.

616
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,199
Make decent money,
have a decent family business.

617
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:04,950
Listen, give me that list or I'm calling
the newspapers, the TV stations and all.

618
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,868
Call them.

619
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,477
You still don't get it?

620
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,150
This plant will be bought by the French.

621
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,038
And you have nothing to do with that?

622
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,993
They decide who are hiring.

623
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,831
Whoever behaves nicely.

624
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:25,630
Don't do anything stupid.
You have a wife and a child to raise.

625
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:28,801
Get some sense into that head of yours
and I'll put you on that list.

626
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:32,157
I see hard times ahead, I told you.
It's going to get worse.

627
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,077
You're screwing us up.

628
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,349
Remember what you did
during the Revolution?

629
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:40,834
What?

630
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:45,870
You gathered here in front of the plant.
"Freedom! Freedom!"

631
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,433
Well, you got it.

632
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,476
You have freedom now.

633
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,478
Handle it!

634
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:24,440
Never call me out here again.
I know what you want and I'm busy.

635
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,358
Wait a second, I have something
important to tell you.

636
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,233
I've heard that one before.
George, I had enough.

637
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,121
No, it's not that. I need you.
I want you to help me with something.

638
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,877
Come on, sit down here for a minute.

639
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:43,630
- What? You know I like you.
- Come on, cut the crap.

640
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:46,110
Stop it! What do you want?

641
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,755
Listen, were you there
when they signed the deal?

642
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,674
Yes.

643
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:58,230
Can you get me a copy
of the contract they signed?

644
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,310
Why would I get involved in this?

645
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:05,035
Well, it's important. I bet
they're hiding something.

646
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:08,516
And if we find any proof, or something,
we can call the press and have a scandal.

647
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,590
Why would I do something like that?

648
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:14,109
You realize that if they catch me,
they will fire me.

649
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:17,240
They're going to fire you anyway
if they privatise the plant, aren't they?

650
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,397
Maybe they won't.

651
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,837
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah!

652
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:25,033
So you did what you had to do to stay here.

653
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,437
- Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
- Wait, what's wrong?

654
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,471
What do you think? If I slept with you
because I liked it,

655
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:32,440
now you think
I'd do it with anyone, or what?

656
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,358
Manuela, no.
No, wait.

657
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,154
You know what? Go home and mind
your own business. I'm finished with you.

658
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,952
Manuela, I didn't want to offend you.
What the hell?

659
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,673
Sure, you didn't want to offend me.

660
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:44,958
Listen, tell me, have you ever loved me
just a little bit?

661
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,875
Or was I just someone
to screw around with?

662
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:53,159
- Come on...
- Say it!

663
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,316
Come on, Manuela, what's wrong with you?

664
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:58,680
To hell with all of you!
Stupid bastards!

665
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:02,755
Easy, easy, so it stops swelling.
And stop fiighting with them.

666
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,800
Let them say whatever they want.
It doesn't matter. It's not your fault.

667
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,797
It matters. Good for you, Viorel!

668
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,956
I'll go to school and
talk to the principal.

669
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,628
What's with these punks?
They're fiighting in school now?

670
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,155
Leave the kid alone.
Go!

671
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:18,348
Good night, baby.

672
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:19,913
Good night.

673
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,472
Good night. Go to sleep!

674
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:36,479
All this is only your fault. You
just had to play hero to save the plant.

675
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:39,114
I'm ashamed to even
walk down the street.

676
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:42,631
And now look.
The child is suffering because of you!

677
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,150
- How is it because of me?
- Because of who, then?

678
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,718
You had to go convincing everybody
to act stupid. My God!

679
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,911
- Ana!
- I think you're losing it!

680
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:55,238
Do you realize if we manage to
buy the plant, no one will fire us?

681
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:58,757
You'll be proud of me.
We'll have money to go on holiday.

682
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,992
Come on, calm down. Really. I'm just trying
to do my best to make it better for us.

683
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:03,400
How could it be better for us?

684
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:05,835
How could it be better
when you're off doing this kind of stuff?

685
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:08,508
Tomorrow you're selling your sperm
to the Americans.

686
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,394
Did you think how that might be
like cheating on me?

687
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:13,238
Did you think about that?

688
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:22,758
If you don't get yourself together, I'm
taking Viorel and I'm going to my mother's.

689
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:25,309
- Oh, come now, leave it!
- Leave it? I'm not leaving it any more!

690
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,321
I kept leaving it for years,
and where are we?

691
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,954
- I'm the butt of everyone's jokes.
- There you go again.

692
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,556
Actually, you don't care about a thing.

693
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:34,863
How will we raise this child?
Will we raise him

694
00:47:34,876 --> 00:47:36,069
with what you're giving
to the sperm clinic?

695
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:37,160
Is that what you want?

696
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:39,280
- I just want to...
- To what? To save the world?

697
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:43,559
Don't you care about your family at all?
Don't you want to save us?

698
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,276
Never mind. I'll just save myself.

699
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:01,757
Don't you touch me, or I'll scream
and wake the whole building.

700
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:06,109
- You don't smoke, you don't drink.
- No, I never liked it.

701
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:10,679
- So you have a child.
- Yes, a 9 year-old son, Viorel.

702
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:12,319
Healthy?

703
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:15,592
Yes, except for measles and such,
and the flu now and then.

704
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:16,760
What studies do you have?

705
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,188
I'm a high school graduate.

706
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,472
With a 9, you know.

707
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,116
What music do you like?

708
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:28,875
Excuse me?

709
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,475
A singer, a composer you prefer.

710
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:35,519
Bolero, by Ravel.

711
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:36,988
I like it very much.

712
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:41,830
Very good. I'll put it down in your record.
It will make a g reat i mpression.

713
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,909
Otherwise your fiile is...

714
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,316
Stand on your feet, please.

715
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,519
- What is your height?
- 1.80 meters.

716
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,517
- Good afternoon.
- Dr. Filip.

717
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,114
Good afternoon.

718
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:58,719
Please, take a seat!

719
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:02,350
I'm a little bit late but I let Otilia
hel p you to complete the forms.

720
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,079
How are we? All OK?

721
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:06,874
We went through everything.
I think it's alright.

722
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:10,877
I gave you all the information
that you requested.

723
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,549
Well done.

724
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,113
Let's see!

725
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:25,918
It's alright.

726
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,791
There's one more thing.

727
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,753
From a single donation
there are many children, usually 10.

728
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:36,110
Sometimes, when they become adults,

729
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,597
some of them want to know
who their biological parents are.

730
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,916
You understand what I mean.

731
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:46,432
If they wanted, would it be OK for them
to contact you?

732
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:49,312
How"s that?

733
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:52,160
I mean, later on, when they're of age,

734
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:54,715
they might want to know
who their biological father is.

735
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,474
Will you allow them to contact you?

736
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,075
What do you mean by contact me?

737
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,228
Sometimes they want to know
where they come from.

738
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,710
But it's very rare, I must say.

739
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:10,758
OK, then.

740
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:15,435
So you give them the address
and they can knock on my door anytime?

741
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:20,188
No, we'll call you first.

742
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:28,598
Your gesture does you proud, sir.

743
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:31,080
You will be giving back hope to a family
that is suffering.

744
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:32,599
On their behalf, I thank you!

745
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,590
The nurse will give you
everything you need.

746
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,229
And... the money?

747
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:43,153
In 2 or 3 days, once we've done our tests.

748
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:46,079
Don't worry, the nurse will guide you.

749
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:47,474
- Thank you.
- You're welcome!

750
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:48,715
Bye.

751
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,273
- Petrescu!
- Yes!

752
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:58,708
Come with me.

753
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,233
Is everything alright?

754
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:12,315
Excuse me, do you have a magazine
or something?

755
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:54,992
My name is Manuela.

756
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,191
My name is Manuela.

757
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,316
I'm 30 years old.

758
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:03,916
I like you a lot.

759
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:07,638
You like me... a lot?

760
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:10,798
I like you a lot.

761
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,750
No, no.
French lessons.

762
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,672
OK, OK.

763
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,511
Do you want to come to France with me?

764
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,111
Come to France with me.

765
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:33,160
No, I work at the factory.

766
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:38,712
What are you going to do
when they close down the factory?

767
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,560
I work at the factory.

768
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:46,638
No. You can't.

769
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:52,750
Yes, yes. I work at the factory.
300 workers.

770
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,712
- You can't.
- Why?

771
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:57,195
Because there will be no factory.

772
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,271
It will close for good.

773
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,716
We will sell all the
equipment and that's it.

774
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,591
No one needs your factory.

775
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,312
They don't care.

776
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,438
This place is dead.

777
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,674
But you said that 300 workers...

778
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:18,915
It's a lie.

779
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:23,356
No one cares about you people.

780
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:29,710
We won't make snail cans there.
We'll sell everything and that's it.

781
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,073
But I care about what happens to you.

782
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:34,998
Manuela...

783
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:38,677
Come to France with me.

784
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:42,316
Here you have no future.

785
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:46,714
You came all this way,

786
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:50,515
you lied to us and now
you're telling me to go with you to France?

787
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,678
Yes, because I tell you the truth.

788
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:55,831
Yes, yes, the truth.

789
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:50,992
- Mama...
- Yes.

790
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:52,912
Do you think daddy is OK?

791
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:55,119
Yes, I think so.

792
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:58,080
Do you think he wrote to
the Sultan of Brunei?

793
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,631
I don't know. Why are you asking?

794
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:03,072
For the bicycle.

795
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:04,909
I don't know...

796
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:11,478
Mama, are you also afraid at night?

797
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:14,710
Come on, enough, go to sleep.
Good night!

798
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:16,035
Good night.

799
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,631
They want more.

800
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:42,990
The Prime Minister's signature,

801
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:45,756
the Economic Advisor's signature,

802
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:50,238
the Minister of Finance's signature.
It's not that easy.

803
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:53,910
You sell the equipment for a high price...

804
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:57,040
I'm selling it for a high price,
but we're partners, we split the profit.

805
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,838
Fifty-fifty.

806
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,349
Yes, I understand.

807
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:04,800
I have many risks... The workers.

808
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:08,557
Press everywhere.

809
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,715
200... 200.

810
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:25,952
The visit to the foster home
was divided in 2 parts.

811
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:31,911
One private, in which Michael found out
that our kids know how to sing,

812
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:36,955
he received a gift from them
and generously offered autographs.

813
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:41,357
Then the star went to the kids' playground,

814
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:44,393
built by the Heal the World Foundation.

815
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,836
Michael's love for the children...

816
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,068
Hello!

817
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:58,759
Ana, is that you?

818
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:15,348
Ana...

819
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:18,992
I'm sorry!

820
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:24,236
I tried to do something
to make things better for us.

821
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:26,155
But..

822
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:29,918
I don't know...

823
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:35,153
I didn't think
you would leave over this.

824
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:41,229
Now I don't know what to do.

825
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:52,957
Is Viorel OK?

826
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:58,472
Ana... come back home!

827
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:02,192
I love you!

828
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:07,553
George, it's me.

829
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,560
Listen... be careful.
These guys are out to trick you.

830
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:21,598
- What?
- They won 't take anybody back.

831
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:25,588
This story with 300 people is a lie.
They're closing the factory and that's it.

832
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:27,833
But how do you know?

833
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:30,599
Somebody told me.

834
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:33,033
Who?

835
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:36,113
Listen, tell everyone.
Everybody should know.

836
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,036
- Did you sleep well?
- Great.

837
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:11,316
I opened the window...
Fresh Romanian air.

838
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:15,837
I' m really hung ry.
Shall we have breakfast?

839
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:17,673
I already ate.

840
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,274
Enjoy your meal!

841
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:26,469
Stop pushing.
We' re registering all of you.

842
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:29,877
Not you, Vasile.
Under 45 years, I told you.

843
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:37,798
Ion, put out that cigarette. I told you.
You know you' re not allowed.

844
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:41,273
Fill in this form here. Starting today,
no more drinking, no more smoking,

845
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:43,317
and no touching your wife, understand?

846
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:45,949
- And what if she wants to...?
- Say you have a headache.

847
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:48,316
Come on, play the Bond.

848
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:50,558
Better drop the gun.

849
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:55,829
- Hey, Gica, how do we do it?
- How do we do what?

850
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:58,241
Tomorrow we meet at the station
and leave for Bucharest.

851
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:01,716
- No, man, how do we do that?
- What's that?

852
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:04,155
That... thing... how do they collect it?

853
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:06,440
They don't collect it themselves,
we give it to them.

854
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:07,913
Just like that? No helping hand?

855
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:10,841
Come on. I'll explain later.
See how many people are waiting in line?

856
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:13,633
No shoving!
Have some patience, OK?

857
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:14,917
How are you?

858
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:15,751
Hi!

859
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,390
My brother-in-law saw a clinic
like that in China, on TV.

860
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:22,319
And they had some nurses
helping the men.

861
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:23,999
What, did they show
the nurses helping them?

862
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:25,713
No, but I thought that's
why they were there.

863
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:28,480
- Do they have nurses at this clinic?
- They do.

864
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,119
Then let's...

865
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:32,312
You should come, too!

866
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:34,480
But when you were there,
did they help you a bit?

867
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:35,919
Come on, I don't need that.

868
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:37,314
OK, whatever.

869
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:41,269
- What do you think about this situation?
- The situation is like this.

870
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:45,155
We realized that this way we can get
enough money to buy the plant.

871
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:48,796
Pay off the debts, buy
a license for the new engine...

872
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:51,436
and start production again.

873
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:55,912
Until now we have a list with 250,
but we hope to have more volunteers.

874
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:59,795
What are your arguments for this initiative
and what are your strong points?

875
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:04,759
Well, here in our factory, we have
vigorous, strong, smart people.

876
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:08,037
What woman wouldn't want
a father like that for her child?

877
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:12,873
We are determined to do this,
and please let everybody know.

878
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:16,789
Maybe a convenient solution can be found.
Or we'll go to Bucharest...

879
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,390
or maybe the clinic will open
a department here, in Campulung.

880
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:23,717
Don't you think this might cause
trouble back home?

881
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:29,153
Each of us should decide it
within their family.

882
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:32,113
Or maybe individually.

883
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:35,957
But I believe we shouldn't
get to this point.

884
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:38,919
To go to such desperate measures.

885
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:43,910
There is no problem.
Everything is under control.

886
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:49,799
The French part is settled.

887
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:52,510
But these guys have gone mad.

888
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:58,152
Petrescu from the union, he's getting
them to think they can buy the plant.

889
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:04,591
I'll take care of it! I'll take care of it.
Yes. It's OK.

890
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:10,994
Like... Iike we said.
Bye.

891
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:16,682
Miss, I have my husband
and my son working

892
01:04:16,695 --> 01:04:18,588
here in this factory. I
don't agree with that.

893
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:19,835
Go home.

894
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:22,754
This is not normal.
Catalin, why do you...?

895
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:25,874
Go home, you're embarassing us.

896
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:31,357
You think, just because we're poor,
we should sell just anything?

897
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:33,272
The French are here!

898
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:52,477
I think it's enough for me.
I'm out of here.

899
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:55,797
Wait a second, what's going on?
What's wrong with you?

900
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,719
We're almost done.
It's good. Everything was solved.

901
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:01,591
We' re a team, aren't we?

902
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:04,360
I don't like this game, Dad.
It's not fun.

903
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:07,950
I came to help you...
That's it. I don't want to live like that.

904
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:11,156
Olivier, this is not the moment.

905
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:14,632
You know you can't save the world.

906
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:25,315
We know that we're in a
diffiicult situation.

907
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:29,190
We will make all efforts to fiind...

908
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:31,956
It's a business that has to go well.

909
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:35,312
If not, I'm fiinished.
It might be the last one.

910
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:38,361
They will fiind a way, you'll see.
They' re used to it.

911
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:41,080
They've always been knee-deep in shit.
I haven't.

912
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:49,271
- OK. I understand.
- What?

913
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:54,476
If you want to keep her, you have
to keep doing business like that.

914
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:56,631
That's easy to see.

915
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:01,795
OK, I'll let you do your business
with the parrot. I'm going.

916
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:21,988
Nelu, let go of that cigarette.
You'll get sick.

917
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:40,799
Good night!

918
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:42,833
Good night.

919
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:46,559
Are you tired?

920
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:48,874
Are you tired?

921
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:50,951
No, but you know tomorrow I'm going
to Bucharest with the guys.

922
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:52,798
I know, I know...

923
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:54,639
OK, good night.

924
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,036
No... stop it!
Wait, wait!

925
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:59,708
You know I can't. Wait!

926
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:01,672
Come on, you know that.

927
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:04,030
It was spelled out on the goddamn form!

928
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:07,357
Yes, I know, but just a little.
They won't notice it.

929
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:10,350
I can't, don't you understand?

930
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:14,548
Woman, we have to save the plant.
What the hell?

931
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:16,478
You don't love me anymore!

932
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:22,032
I do love you. But I can't do it tonight.

933
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:24,478
I' m working for export.

934
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:26,519
Good night.

935
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:59,074
I will forget everything I've had

936
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:08,153
The burden I've carried so long,
The moment we said goodbye.

937
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:17,033
I won't ask for the impossible
I won't ask for your love

938
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:27,032
No need to look away

939
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:36,119
Our paths might cross someday

940
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:45,591
Our paths and love,
Our thoughts and happiness...

941
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:22,754
Stop eating, man.

942
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:31,393
Stop smoking. I told you.

943
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:35,355
Who's sneaking in the front of the line?

944
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:37,716
What's the hurry?

945
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:41,955
- What's for sale here?
- Concert tickets.

946
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:44,156
For Michael Jackson, free.

947
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:46,316
- Who?
- Michael Jackson.

948
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,594
Do you think you've got enough
cups for everybody?

949
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:51,994
It's not possible to...

950
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:54,594
We can come tomorrow as well.
In smaller groups.

951
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:56,347
Still, we need to hurry
because the factory

952
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:57,917
is going to be sold at
the end of the month.

953
01:09:58,080 --> 01:09:59,911
- Sir, that's not possible.
- Why not?

954
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:01,308
Come on, Gica!

955
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:05,640
I understand, you know. We're talking large
quantities here. Can I make a proposition?

956
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:06,670
Sir...

957
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:08,996
We can give you a discount.
Let's say 20 percent.

958
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:10,349
That's enough, sir!

959
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:12,198
This way you only pay 40 dollars
per collection.

960
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:13,913
Enough, sir!

961
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:16,436
We deal with serious things here.

962
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:18,520
What we do here
determines the lives of children

963
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:20,720
and the happiness
of families that are now suffering.

964
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:23,480
I don't fiind your mockery
amusing in the least.

965
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:27,832
Our plant is bankrupt, madam. They're
privatizing it at the end of the month.

966
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:29,996
And they want to lay us all off.

967
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:33,590
Most of the guys you see out there
have children.

968
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:37,713
Children who want to eat, get dressed,
go to school, play...

969
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:41,473
How can they do that, madam,
if their fathers are unemployed? How?

970
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:47,075
- Stop yelling at me. I can't help you.
- Why, doctor, why?

971
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:52,118
The sperm that we buy here, we sell abroad.

972
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:55,517
We sell it to families that can't
have children the natural way.

973
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:57,711
We sell it to gay women

974
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:00,718
who want to have a child
without a man in their lives.

975
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:03,790
These people have a lot of money.

976
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:08,472
Enough money to buy the sperm
and also the treatment that's needed.

977
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:12,873
They want to give their children
as many chances as possible.

978
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:14,991
Yes, of course.

979
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:19,109
That's why they want to donor to be
a tall, handsome, young man...

980
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:24,070
with a high lQ, well-educated
and cultured.

981
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:27,117
Let me give you an example.

982
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:30,232
The best seller on the market now is
the sperm of Danish students.

983
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:32,749
They're tall, handsome, blond.

984
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:36,277
Our clients do not want to buy
the sperm of a Romanian worker.

985
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:39,359
Especially not in those quantities.

986
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:42,711
How's that our fault, doctor?

987
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:45,637
We're people, too.

988
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:50,229
I don't know, but I can't help you.

989
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:55,995
We won't go, we won't go,
Until we save Aro.

990
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:00,358
They say that it...

991
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:03,670
that it's good for the skin.

992
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:07,955
To keep it fresh.

993
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:14,077
Can't you use the collections
for cosmetic products?

994
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:15,881
I don't know if it's good for the skin,

995
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:18,315
but they don't make skincare products
from such things.

996
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:20,630
Go home and mind your business.

997
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:33,706
You didn't give me the
money for last time.

998
01:12:33,719 --> 01:12:35,515
What money?

999
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:37,717
50 dollars for last time.
I already donated.

1000
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:40,480
- Yes, yes. What's your name?
- Petrescu.

1001
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:42,238
- Petrescu?
- George Petrescu.

1002
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:44,357
George... hold on.

1003
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:49,071
Petrescu George.

1004
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:51,835
Yes.

1005
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:57,470
You donated on the 17th,

1006
01:12:58,360 --> 01:12:59,873
but we don't owe you anything.

1007
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:02,473
But I donated.

1008
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:05,638
Yes, that's true, you donated,
but we can't use it.

1009
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:08,073
You're sterile.

1010
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:11,677
You can't have children.

1011
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:18,834
It's a genetic disease, from birth.
It's called the Kleinfelter syndrome.

1012
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:22,188
Come on, madam.
How is that possible?

1013
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:24,558
No, it's nothing serious.

1014
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:26,955
You won't die from this,
you don't need any treatment.

1015
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:30,112
Only... that you can't have children, ever.

1016
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:32,389
That's it.

1017
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:35,875
Doctor, maybe there was a mix-up
with the cups.

1018
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:38,235
We're a very serious clinic.

1019
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:41,519
Goodbye!

1020
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:51,236
What will I do now?

1021
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:59,114
I don't know. It's not my problem.
Please get your colleagues and go home.

1022
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:05,750
Gica!

1023
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:26,912
So, Gica, how was it?
Are you fiinished, huh?

1024
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:29,241
Come on, don't keep us waiting.
Did you donate?

1025
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:31,630
How was it? It didn't hurt, did it?

1026
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:37,437
Guys, they don't want to collect.

1027
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:42,712
What do you mean, they
don't want to collect?

1028
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:44,791
Why did we come all this way?

1029
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:47,116
What, they don't have enough jars?

1030
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:51,078
They don't wanna collect
because we' re workers.

1031
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:56,471
Come on, you scared us.
Now tell us!

1032
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:59,195
Come on, we're in a hurry.
We can go in 2 or 3 at a time.

1033
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:01,709
Hey! Didn't you hear?
They're not collecting, damn it!

1034
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:07,392
Wait, wait!

1035
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:11,471
- Why is that, Gica? Why?
- Because we're workers.

1036
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:14,234
- They' re saying their clients...
- Quiet!

1037
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:16,715
Wait, let's hear what the man has to say.

1038
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:20,597
They say... their clients don't want
to buy from workers.

1039
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:22,518
Who do they want to buy from?

1040
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:26,952
From educated people, students, doctors.
Shut up, man! Quiet!

1041
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:30,478
- What the hell's wrong with ours?
- They say it's not the same.

1042
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:33,913
Why don't you wanna collect from us?
What's wrong with us?

1043
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:39,750
Cut it out!

1044
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,752
Have we got the plague or something?

1045
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:49,679
Go away, move it!

1046
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:52,155
I made a fool of myself,
got the wife all pissed at me...

1047
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:54,592
Police! Call the police!

1048
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:31,351
The sperm of Danish students, you say?

1049
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:34,189
Yes, that's what the doctor said.

1050
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:36,630
Well if I'd known,
I should have dyed my hair blond.

1051
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:43,718
We should have gone to Michael's concert.

1052
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:48,276
What will I tell my wife now?

1053
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:54,594
Sunburned, beaten by the police...
And no fucking money to show for it.

1054
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:58,718
We'll be their laughing stock back home.

1055
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:04,475
He'll laugh in our face.

1056
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:09,479
"You made fools of
yourselves in Bucharest."

1057
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:12,112
"I'm going to fire all of you."

1058
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:38,479
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing.

1059
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:41,115
Yeah, nothing. Tell me what's wrong?

1060
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:47,636
What am I going to tell Viorel now?

1061
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:50,632
He really wants a bicycle.

1062
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:54,631
I wanted to get him one with the money
from my last donation.

1063
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:57,789
And they didn't give you anything?

1064
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:22,034
Take it!

1065
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:24,472
- No.
- Take it!

1066
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:26,473
Ion...

1067
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:29,635
Come on, or we'll miss our train.

1068
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:38,430
Our paths might cross someday.

1069
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:47,071
Our paths and love,
Our thoughts and happiness.

1070
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:21,990
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

1071
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:32,995
Manuela...

1072
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:36,316
I have a surprise for you.

1073
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:02,875
Like night, like dreams

1074
01:20:03,080 --> 01:20:05,389
Are the black eyes of my love

1075
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:07,631
Manuela

1076
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:11,955
Like ear of wheat in spring

1077
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:14,755
Like full moon is my love

1078
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:16,798
Manuela

1079
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:21,429
Her loving words,

1080
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:24,076
The restless look of my love

1081
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:26,272
Manuela

1082
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:31,069
You have my senses imprisoned,

1083
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:34,750
And all my dreams are
for Manuela

1084
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:40,190
Since it came into my life

1085
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:45,436
Since that afternoon
when I met Manuela.

1086
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:50,079
I'm happy like no one is,

1087
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:54,077
Because every day is witing for me

1088
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:57,154
The sweetness of her kisses,

1089
01:20:57,640 --> 01:21:01,349
And that immense love that
Manuela gives to me.

1090
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:20,430
We'll manage somehow.

1091
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:27,790
Are you working for export tonight,

1092
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:30,794
or do you have some for
the internal market?

1093
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:41,750
What's up, George?
Did you get a package?

1094
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:44,589
Still saving the plant?

1095
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:59,599
Daddy! It's daddy!

1096
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:04,191
How are you?

1097
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:08,236
Come on, run!
Run, run, it's raining!

1098
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:12,349
- What's that? The bicycle?
- Yes.

1099
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:15,398
- Is it from the Sultan of Brunei?
- No, it's from me.

1100
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:18,116
Tonight, I'm the Sultan of Brunei.

1101
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:20,680
I told you, Mommy! I told you
daddy would bring me a bicycle.

1102
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:22,478
- Yes.
- Look!

1103
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:24,989
- Look, it has a horn too.
- Go, go!

1104
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:30,350
There you go. Well done!

1105
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:32,397
I found this bicycle in Bucharest.

1106
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:34,352
- How was it?
- It was OK.

1107
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:43,430
Listen...

1108
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:46,757
you know what they told me
at the clinic?

1109
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:51,670
They told me I can't have children.

1110
01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:57,908
They told me I have a syndrome...
I can't remember...

1111
01:23:58,120 --> 01:24:00,190
Something with a German name.

1112
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:06,914
You know what I did?
I broke their windows.

1113
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:08,838
How could they say that?

1114
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:11,671
Viorel's got my eyes,

1115
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:13,999
doesn't he?

1116
01:24:15,680 --> 01:24:17,671
Yes, he has your eyes.

1117
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:30,714
Get him out of the rain,
so he won't catch a cold.

1118
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:51,557
Look, Cucu, there's one
To your right.

1119
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:54,558
Look over there.
Get him, he's running away!

1120
01:24:55,640 --> 01:24:59,519
- Careful. That one's going for export.
- Look how fat this one is!

1121
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:05,034
Ion, do you think Manuela's French guy
is really taking the snails to France?

1122
01:25:05,240 --> 01:25:07,913
Yes, he says so. He's paying
one dollar per kilogram.

1123
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:17,196
So you're going to Paris?

1124
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:20,392
Lucky bastard...

1125
01:26:01,680 --> 01:26:04,427
To live on a footing with eternity
is to live from day to day.

1126
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:07,198
Emil Cioran
- Romanian philosopher

1127
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:37,313
At 16:02, the inevitable did happen.

1128
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:40,830
Michael Jackson's personal jet
took off for lstanbul,

1129
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:43,634
his next stop on the Dangerous tour.

1130
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:47,589
To his list on conquests, Michael Jackson
can now add his Romanian fans.

1131
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:51,075
