1
00:00:40,857 --> 00:00:42,384
<i>Can you hear them?</i>

2
00:00:42,554 --> 00:00:44,377
<i>The night noises.</i>

3
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:47,061
<i>Mockingbird in the magnolia.</i>

4
00:00:47,292 --> 00:00:50,228
<i>See the moss hanging</i>
<i>from the moonlight.</i>

5
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,468
<i>Fairly taste the night, can't you?</i>

6
00:00:55,456 --> 00:00:59,898
<i>You're part of it, Pres,</i>
<i>and it's part of you.</i>

7
00:01:01,282 --> 00:01:03,192
<i>Like I am.</i>

8
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:07,100
<i>You can't get away from us, Pres,</i>
<i>we're both in your blood.</i>

9
00:01:07,269 --> 00:01:10,653
<i>This is the country you were born to,</i>
<i>the country you know and trust.</i>

10
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:14,146
<i>Your country, Pres.</i>
<i>Amy wouldn't understand.</i>

11
00:01:14,312 --> 00:01:17,030
- <i>She'd think there would be snakes.</i>
- <i>Julie, please.</i>

12
00:01:17,194 --> 00:01:19,104
<i>Oh, it isn't tame. It isn't like the North.</i>

13
00:01:19,274 --> 00:01:21,576
<i>It's quick and dangerous,</i>
<i>but you trust it.</i>

14
00:01:21,739 --> 00:01:24,807
<i>Remember how the fever mist smells</i>
<i>in the bottoms, rank and rotten...</i>

15
00:01:25,292 --> 00:01:28,010
<i>...but you trust that, too,</i>
<i>because it's part of you...</i>

16
00:01:28,174 --> 00:01:32,234
<i>...just as I'm part of you</i>
<i>and will never let you go.</i>

17
00:02:00,348 --> 00:02:01,876
Yes, ma'am?

18
00:02:02,749 --> 00:02:03,927
Hello. Where's Richard?

19
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,969
Oh, he's not in today.
Could I have your name, please?

20
00:02:07,391 --> 00:02:09,848
Hack, Marilyn Hack. Stage 11.

21
00:02:12,577 --> 00:02:15,546
I'm sorry, I-- You look familiar.
Are you an actor?

22
00:02:16,194 --> 00:02:17,472
Thirty-two years.

23
00:02:18,148 --> 00:02:21,116
Yeah. You were in that prison movie
with Sharon Stone.

24
00:02:21,573 --> 00:02:22,522
No.

25
00:02:22,694 --> 00:02:26,078
And you had that scene where you
punched that little girl in the face.

26
00:02:26,247 --> 00:02:28,582
- Not me.
- That was a good movie.

27
00:02:28,744 --> 00:02:30,884
You should have been in that movie.

28
00:02:31,529 --> 00:02:33,636
I'm sure I should have been.
May I go in?

29
00:02:33,802 --> 00:02:35,363
Sure. And you're all set.

30
00:02:36,075 --> 00:02:37,767
Have a good one.

31
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,368
Yes.

32
00:02:43,534 --> 00:02:45,804
- Got a chair open.
- Oh, Sandy, am I late?

33
00:02:45,967 --> 00:02:48,357
- Oh, you're fine.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

34
00:02:48,529 --> 00:02:52,754
Per our conversation yesterday,
I think steer clear of the Sephardic tones.

35
00:02:52,915 --> 00:02:55,666
Go for the A-one or the A-two,
the Ashkenazi palette.

36
00:02:55,828 --> 00:02:57,901
I didn't mean to make
such a big deal out of it.

37
00:02:58,069 --> 00:02:59,117
Oh, it's nothing.

38
00:02:59,286 --> 00:03:01,774
I just thought I could look a little younger,
couldn't I?

39
00:03:01,942 --> 00:03:04,016
- But it's okay.
- You are playing an older woman.

40
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,673
But I could be a woman
who's taken good care of herself.

41
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,401
Who has a terminal illness.

42
00:03:08,569 --> 00:03:11,320
Up until then, I--
You're right. You're right.

43
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:13,786
Liz said I should get
my face stonewashed like her--

44
00:03:13,948 --> 00:03:17,299
Oh, honey, are we aware of
what was on cable last night?

45
00:03:17,469 --> 00:03:19,358
<i>Song for Reuben.</i>

46
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,138
Honey, you killed me.
When was the last time you saw that?

47
00:03:22,304 --> 00:03:24,280
- I've never seen it.
- I was a total puddle.

48
00:03:24,448 --> 00:03:26,937
I mean, complete waterworks.
They had to resuscitate me.

49
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:30,686
I'm never gonna watch it again unless my
wife takes up CPR or paramedics move in.

50
00:03:30,851 --> 00:03:32,193
I was dying.

51
00:03:32,356 --> 00:03:33,764
We were babies then, weren't we?

52
00:03:33,925 --> 00:03:35,387
- Yes, we were.
- Babies.

53
00:03:35,557 --> 00:03:38,340
You have such a gift,
you shouldn't just keep it to yourself.

54
00:03:38,503 --> 00:03:40,959
- You should teach.
- Teach?

55
00:03:41,128 --> 00:03:42,689
Teach acting.

56
00:03:43,273 --> 00:03:44,255
I wouldn't dare.

57
00:03:44,425 --> 00:03:47,361
You gotta give it away to keep it.
You can't just hold on to this.

58
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,840
Sandy, now you're mocking me.

59
00:03:49,003 --> 00:03:51,371
You might as well say,
"Why don't you save the world?"

60
00:03:51,532 --> 00:03:53,802
Well, maybe you could
with what you have to give.

61
00:03:54,253 --> 00:03:56,359
Victor. Victor.

62
00:03:56,526 --> 00:03:57,836
- Hey.
- Oh, Morley.

63
00:03:57,999 --> 00:03:59,887
- Yeah.
- What the hell are you doing here?

64
00:04:00,048 --> 00:04:01,293
- What am I doing here?
- Yeah.

65
00:04:01,457 --> 00:04:04,240
- You wanted to have a meeting?
- Yes. Yesterday.

66
00:04:04,402 --> 00:04:06,476
We had a meeting scheduled.
You didn't show.

67
00:04:06,642 --> 00:04:09,677
Yesterday? No, no, no.
No, no. What the hell are you talking--?

68
00:04:09,844 --> 00:04:12,082
I was in the office all day.
Why didn't you call--?

69
00:04:12,246 --> 00:04:14,516
I called you.
You didn't return my message.

70
00:04:14,678 --> 00:04:17,908
- Well, you got a minute now, because--?
- No, I have to go to the stage.

71
00:04:18,072 --> 00:04:19,828
What did you wanna talk about?

72
00:04:19,992 --> 00:04:22,033
A lot of things. But, look...

73
00:04:22,361 --> 00:04:23,606
...I'm working for scale.

74
00:04:23,771 --> 00:04:26,041
An actor of my stature,
40 years in the business?

75
00:04:26,203 --> 00:04:28,091
There's no excuse for me
working for scale.

76
00:04:28,252 --> 00:04:30,261
That's exactly what
I've been telling people.

77
00:04:30,429 --> 00:04:32,340
- You should not be working for scale.
- Good.

78
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:35,359
But you know these producers,
they have their own take on things.

79
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:37,757
I'm on your side, all right? I'm your agent.

80
00:04:37,921 --> 00:04:39,547
You are my number-one priority.

81
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:43,676
There is nothing more important to me
in my life than--

82
00:04:43,843 --> 00:04:45,152
Than you. Excuse me.

83
00:04:45,315 --> 00:04:46,745
Yeah.

84
00:04:47,877 --> 00:04:49,285
Stranger, what do you say?

85
00:04:49,894 --> 00:04:51,935
Nothing important. I'm here with a client.

86
00:04:52,103 --> 00:04:53,313
- I gotta go.
- Hang on.

87
00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:57,343
Good, because I gotta take this, Victor.
Look, stop by the office any time.

88
00:04:57,513 --> 00:04:59,107
You know, we moved.

89
00:04:59,754 --> 00:05:00,703
Yeah, talk.

90
00:05:00,874 --> 00:05:02,915
I've done all my homework
on this guy.

91
00:05:03,084 --> 00:05:05,157
I've established everything
there is to know...

92
00:05:05,324 --> 00:05:07,561
...as far as his short-term objectives go.

93
00:05:07,725 --> 00:05:10,377
I know that I wanna defend my sister,
console my father...

94
00:05:10,542 --> 00:05:12,583
...and, ultimately, I feel a sense of guilt...

95
00:05:12,752 --> 00:05:16,332
...for having abandoned my shipmates in
the Galápagos Islands to come home, but--

96
00:05:16,497 --> 00:05:18,472
I think you're making this
too complicated.

97
00:05:18,963 --> 00:05:21,419
This is not about,
"What is the actor thinking?"

98
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:25,037
You go and see a movie, you don't say,
"I wonder what he's thinking."

99
00:05:25,205 --> 00:05:27,093
You gotta know.
Can you see the difference?

100
00:05:27,254 --> 00:05:30,190
That's exactly my problem...
I wanna show you what I'm thinking...

101
00:05:30,359 --> 00:05:32,913
...but there are certain things
that I'm not sure about.

102
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,049
- I love the fact that you did all this work.
- Yeah.

103
00:05:36,218 --> 00:05:38,674
I think it will help you later,
but not on this movie...

104
00:05:38,843 --> 00:05:40,404
...if you know what I mean.

105
00:05:41,116 --> 00:05:44,827
Oh, my God. Doesn't he know about
her allergies? Here's what you have to do...

106
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:47,358
...you have to call me tomorrow--
Give me two secs.

107
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:50,837
--as soon as they get back
and let me know exactly what happened.

108
00:05:51,009 --> 00:05:53,759
Bye. I'm so excited for you. Bye.

109
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:56,507
Hey. Sorry about that.

110
00:05:58,628 --> 00:06:03,932
Miss Campanella, this publicity campaign
is to be run with military precision.

111
00:06:04,102 --> 00:06:08,163
It is to be timely, quantifiable
and orotund.

112
00:06:08,328 --> 00:06:09,823
- Do you know what that means?
- No.

113
00:06:09,992 --> 00:06:12,776
I warn you. These are actors.

114
00:06:12,938 --> 00:06:16,868
In every actor there lives a tiger, a pig,
an ass and a nightingale.

115
00:06:17,036 --> 00:06:19,273
You never know
which one's gonna show up.

116
00:06:19,436 --> 00:06:23,431
Don't make assumptions about the talent.
Don't assume that the talent can hear well.

117
00:06:23,598 --> 00:06:27,397
Don't assume they know the plot.
Don't assume that they have living parents.

118
00:06:27,568 --> 00:06:30,057
Don't assume that
they don't have a drop of Indian blood.

119
00:06:30,225 --> 00:06:32,845
Question, do I look like
I have Indian blood?

120
00:06:33,747 --> 00:06:35,024
- Not at all--
- Question...

121
00:06:35,188 --> 00:06:39,630
...would it surprise you to learn
that I am one-eighth mighty Choctaw?

122
00:06:40,053 --> 00:06:41,264
- It would--
- Question...

123
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:45,261
...would it astound you to learn
that here on the set, I am Corey Taft...

124
00:06:45,432 --> 00:06:47,538
...but when I'm at home, I'm Jo-Jo?

125
00:06:47,993 --> 00:06:49,237
Picture's up.

126
00:06:49,401 --> 00:06:51,311
- Roll sound.
- Sound speed.

127
00:06:51,482 --> 00:06:52,912
And dolly.

128
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,690
And action.

129
00:06:58,461 --> 00:07:00,284
She's not coming.

130
00:07:00,734 --> 00:07:05,341
She's not coming home
to see her sick mother.

131
00:07:05,505 --> 00:07:07,415
She'll be home.

132
00:07:08,642 --> 00:07:10,912
And you, Shmuel?

133
00:07:11,363 --> 00:07:12,957
How long do you think you can stay?

134
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,203
I don't rightly know, Daddy.

135
00:07:15,365 --> 00:07:17,275
Long as it takes, I expect.

136
00:07:17,446 --> 00:07:20,481
The Navy's pretty accommodating
about things like illness...

137
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,361
...and death.

138
00:07:24,745 --> 00:07:27,266
Your mama was so happy
to see you today.

139
00:07:27,434 --> 00:07:29,606
Oh, I know she couldn't show it...

140
00:07:29,771 --> 00:07:32,772
...but she was <i>kvelling</i> in her own way.

141
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,942
<i>She smiled,</i>
<i>but I don't know if she knew who I was.</i>

142
00:07:36,109 --> 00:07:38,893
<i>Your coming home today</i>
<i>was a dang mitzvah, is what it was.</i>

143
00:07:39,055 --> 00:07:41,838
It ain't no mitzvah, Daddy.
It's family.

144
00:07:42,001 --> 00:07:43,692
It's what a son does for his mama.

145
00:07:43,857 --> 00:07:46,127
And what does a daughter do
for her mama?

146
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:49,226
Your sister ain't been home
in nigh onto 12 years.

147
00:07:49,396 --> 00:07:52,114
I don't give two hoots
what Doc Silverstein says.

148
00:07:52,277 --> 00:07:56,982
It was your sister
that put your mama on her deathbed.

149
00:07:58,071 --> 00:08:01,389
I know Rachel, Daddy.
And she'll come home to see Mama.

150
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:04,343
And she'll come home
because it's Purim.

151
00:08:04,507 --> 00:08:06,646
We all know what that means to Mama...

152
00:08:06,811 --> 00:08:08,754
...or meant.

153
00:08:09,532 --> 00:08:11,638
Was that Rachel's voice I heard...

154
00:08:12,413 --> 00:08:15,098
...or am I just going meshuga?

155
00:08:17,024 --> 00:08:18,518
Mama!

156
00:08:20,097 --> 00:08:21,788
And cut.

157
00:08:22,434 --> 00:08:24,737
Okay, everybody,
stay where you are, please.

158
00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:26,590
That's a cut.

159
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,481
I thought it was great.
It's fantastic.

160
00:08:28,645 --> 00:08:30,685
I just have a couple of suggestions.

161
00:08:30,853 --> 00:08:32,577
You guys were great.

162
00:08:32,742 --> 00:08:35,678
Simon, the move is too fast,
so we're gonna have to slow it down...

163
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,337
...and I wanna add one thing,
so just watch for a second.

164
00:08:38,505 --> 00:08:42,336
Marilyn, you had a swooning,
kind of a fainting move which I love.

165
00:08:42,507 --> 00:08:44,330
It's great. I love the eyes rolling back.

166
00:08:44,492 --> 00:08:47,079
I want you to add one more thing,
something more...

167
00:08:47,245 --> 00:08:51,240
...almost from the bottom
of your womanhood to make it a:

168
00:08:52,623 --> 00:08:53,769
So let-- Let me--

169
00:08:53,936 --> 00:08:56,326
- Let me see what that would look like.
- Okay.

170
00:09:02,451 --> 00:09:05,136
Exactly. And Brian, I love that thing.

171
00:09:05,301 --> 00:09:07,538
Let me see that, just that flash.

172
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:11,694
No, not the intake of breath,
just the eyes flashing as if:

173
00:09:11,863 --> 00:09:14,767
"Mommy is going now?"

174
00:09:14,937 --> 00:09:16,945
So this is gonna be great.

175
00:09:17,114 --> 00:09:18,543
Whitney? Hi there.

176
00:09:18,715 --> 00:09:20,690
- Can I talk with you for a moment?
- Oh, yeah.

177
00:09:20,859 --> 00:09:22,682
Hi. You okay in there?

178
00:09:24,061 --> 00:09:25,884
- Not interrupting a meal or anything?
- No.

179
00:09:26,494 --> 00:09:29,048
Sorry I'm on this thing. I hurt my back.

180
00:09:29,215 --> 00:09:31,671
- I fell over the side of an escalator.
- Great.

181
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:36,698
Whitney, I have to tell you that
I have been a publicist for 20 years--

182
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:40,316
Fifteen and five strapped to the gurney.

183
00:09:40,484 --> 00:09:45,221
I have never experienced
the hostility that this little picture...

184
00:09:45,382 --> 00:09:49,540
...which I think is a charming show,
is engendering in the community.

185
00:09:49,704 --> 00:09:53,416
I've had hang-ups.
I've had rude-- Rude responses.

186
00:09:53,578 --> 00:09:57,060
- That's not what I'm getting on this one.
- That's not good. But you know what?

187
00:09:57,228 --> 00:10:00,163
It's all right because we should go
a whole different angle...

188
00:10:00,332 --> 00:10:02,308
- ...that no one's even thought of.
- Okay.

189
00:10:02,478 --> 00:10:05,196
What if we go the angle of
let's play it down?

190
00:10:05,359 --> 00:10:08,175
Let's tell people not to see our show?

191
00:10:08,336 --> 00:10:10,825
- What about--?
- That's a dangerous sell, Whitney.

192
00:10:10,993 --> 00:10:13,612
Put a big ad in the paper
and say, "Don't come."

193
00:10:13,778 --> 00:10:15,339
Okay. True enough.

194
00:10:15,507 --> 00:10:20,594
But as my proud ancestors,
the Choctaw, say...

195
00:10:20,757 --> 00:10:22,765
...what we're dealing with
on this picture is:

196
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,555
Difficult to translate it.
Basically, we don't have a blanket.

197
00:10:29,721 --> 00:10:32,406
We don't have a blanket for a--

198
00:10:33,851 --> 00:10:36,023
It's a diuretic pony, I'm sorry--

199
00:10:36,188 --> 00:10:39,735
Urinary-problem pony to piss on.
Excuse me.

200
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:41,718
- Give me one sec.
- Okay.

201
00:10:41,886 --> 00:10:43,960
- Just look up.
- I just need one sec.

202
00:10:44,128 --> 00:10:45,917
Can you do that without touching me?

203
00:10:47,361 --> 00:10:48,344
You're fine.

204
00:10:48,513 --> 00:10:49,692
- Gorgeous.
- Thank you.

205
00:10:49,859 --> 00:10:52,227
- I'm almost set here. We're rolling.
- We're good?

206
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,719
Okay. Actors.

207
00:10:54,884 --> 00:10:56,314
Actors acting.

208
00:10:56,741 --> 00:10:58,170
- Good.
- Not right now.

209
00:10:58,342 --> 00:11:00,448
- But, yeah.
- Oh, you don't think you are?

210
00:11:00,615 --> 00:11:02,688
I mean, we're all acting all the time.

211
00:11:02,855 --> 00:11:04,798
You know, but I'm acting differently.

212
00:11:05,225 --> 00:11:07,495
So tell me, <i>Home for Purim</i>.

213
00:11:07,658 --> 00:11:09,349
- <i>Home for Purim.</i>
- Yeah.

214
00:11:09,515 --> 00:11:11,076
It's a period film.

215
00:11:11,243 --> 00:11:14,310
- Yeah.
- I play Rachel Pischer.

216
00:11:14,605 --> 00:11:17,159
I play Sam Pischer,
her brother, little brother.

217
00:11:17,326 --> 00:11:18,788
Yeah.

218
00:11:19,215 --> 00:11:21,900
But, which brings me to,
I heard a rumor that you two are:

219
00:11:23,728 --> 00:11:24,907
- Yeah...
- Is that true?

220
00:11:25,074 --> 00:11:27,409
- Depends on what you mean by:
- That's so cool.

221
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:29,196
- That's really cute.
- It is.

222
00:11:29,363 --> 00:11:31,153
We are-- That-- It's a very--

223
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:35,212
It's a very interesting scenario,
playing siblings, living the life of lovers.

224
00:11:35,382 --> 00:11:38,831
Well, tell me how you both
got started in acting as art?

225
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:42,514
I started doing standup
at Jerry Seltzer's Laff Emporium.

226
00:11:42,682 --> 00:11:47,223
I was at Chortles, The Comedy Place.

227
00:11:47,387 --> 00:11:50,388
And-- But no one really--

228
00:11:50,557 --> 00:11:53,373
- No one really got it.
- I got it.

229
00:11:53,534 --> 00:11:55,902
- I thought it was hysterical.
- What did she do?

230
00:11:56,063 --> 00:11:57,722
She has a show. Tell her the title.

231
00:11:57,888 --> 00:12:00,540
- <i>No Penis Intended.</i>
- Oh, I actually did hear, yes.

232
00:12:00,705 --> 00:12:02,942
- What was that about?
- One critic described it as:

233
00:12:03,106 --> 00:12:07,963
"A humorless romp
into Miss Webb's dysfunctional psyche."

234
00:12:08,132 --> 00:12:10,435
- That's a humorless critic.
- That doesn't make sense.

235
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:11,972
- No.
- No.

236
00:12:18,505 --> 00:12:20,393
Tuesday night. Eleven-ish.

237
00:12:20,553 --> 00:12:23,075
Diamond Pawnbroker
on Sterling and Fifth.

238
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:26,277
- Ring a bell?
- Yeah. There was a break-in.

239
00:12:26,444 --> 00:12:27,907
And did you make out the report?

240
00:12:28,429 --> 00:12:30,764
- Did I what?
- You heard me, son!

241
00:12:30,926 --> 00:12:32,836
Yes, I made out the report.

242
00:12:33,007 --> 00:12:37,384
This report is an I-N270,
file number 79251J.

243
00:12:37,553 --> 00:12:40,783
It is not a 35-DIB...

244
00:12:40,947 --> 00:12:43,217
<i>...and should not be filed as such.</i>

245
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,486
<i>Do I make myself clear?</i>

246
00:12:46,581 --> 00:12:48,436
That's a good clip. That was a good clip.

247
00:12:48,597 --> 00:12:49,972
I loved that. I love the movie.

248
00:12:50,134 --> 00:12:52,623
<i>Paper Badge</i>, I just loved it.
What a roller-coaster ride.

249
00:12:52,792 --> 00:12:54,549
Nothing happened!

250
00:12:54,713 --> 00:12:57,169
- Nothing happened in that clip.
- But that's the beauty--

251
00:12:57,338 --> 00:13:00,601
Yes, it's about time in a film
nothing happened. It's about time.

252
00:13:00,763 --> 00:13:04,060
It always, it's-- People get
to story points and have a little problem...

253
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:07,571
- ...and then they say, "Let's blow it up."
- I am not one for violence...

254
00:13:07,742 --> 00:13:10,526
...but I would have given anything
to see a coffee pot explode.

255
00:13:10,687 --> 00:13:12,411
What a brave choice the director made.

256
00:13:12,576 --> 00:13:15,163
What a-- What a pioneer this guy is.
"Let's do nothing."

257
00:13:15,618 --> 00:13:18,815
<i>Sometimes it looks like somebody hit you</i>
<i>with a frying pan and you enjoyed it.</i>

258
00:13:18,979 --> 00:13:22,493
<i>But I have been hit.</i>
<i>Been hit a couple of times.</i>

259
00:13:22,661 --> 00:13:27,398
<i>You know, this film reminds me of your wife</i>
<i>and her ceramic turtle collection.</i>

260
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:29,502
Can't believe you keep this
in your purse.

261
00:13:29,672 --> 00:13:32,161
- Well, you never know.
- Yeah.

262
00:13:32,328 --> 00:13:36,705
Mr. Orfkin, for the third time,
Victor Allan Miller is waiting.

263
00:13:36,907 --> 00:13:39,658
Oh, okay, just give me five seconds
and then send him in.

264
00:13:44,878 --> 00:13:46,253
Right this way, Mr. Miller.

265
00:13:46,415 --> 00:13:49,067
Now, you listen to me, Bernie,
you may run a studio...

266
00:13:49,232 --> 00:13:53,457
...but I've got way too much respect for
my clients to put up with this kind of crap.

267
00:13:53,618 --> 00:13:55,342
Hang on. Simi, hold all my calls.

268
00:13:55,507 --> 00:13:58,738
I'm in a meeting with Victor Allan Miller.
I do not wanna be disturbed.

269
00:13:58,901 --> 00:14:00,527
I gotta run. Ciao.

270
00:14:00,693 --> 00:14:03,061
- Thank you, Simi.
- Hey, look at you.

271
00:14:03,222 --> 00:14:05,525
- Look at you.
- You look fantastic.

272
00:14:05,687 --> 00:14:08,688
- Thank you. Thank you.
- You should be stopping by more often.

273
00:14:08,857 --> 00:14:11,062
- Really? I know, I know.
- Yes, you should.

274
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:14,261
But we're not filming today,
I thought I'd drop by, say hello...

275
00:14:14,428 --> 00:14:16,021
...while my tires are being rotated.

276
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,716
- Well, let's talk movies.
- Okay.

277
00:14:17,884 --> 00:14:20,274
Okay? Movies.

278
00:14:20,445 --> 00:14:23,294
There's nothing going on
in movies right now for you.

279
00:14:23,455 --> 00:14:25,693
I mean, it's just-- This is the thing.

280
00:14:25,856 --> 00:14:27,962
There was just--
There's no interest, okay?

281
00:14:28,129 --> 00:14:29,918
You're like a cold piece of toast.

282
00:14:30,082 --> 00:14:31,905
I'm not gonna
candy-coat things for you...

283
00:14:32,067 --> 00:14:34,851
...because if you want candy-coated
information, go someplace--

284
00:14:35,012 --> 00:14:37,249
Go to one of the bigger agencies.
Okay? Because I--

285
00:14:37,413 --> 00:14:39,203
My thing is say it like it is.

286
00:14:39,366 --> 00:14:42,716
But right now I don't think film
is what we should be focusing on.

287
00:14:42,887 --> 00:14:47,013
Quite frankly, I think television
is where we should be looking.

288
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:50,692
- I know, but television--
- Okay, we're on a couple of pilots. Listen.

289
00:14:50,859 --> 00:14:52,037
Listen, Victor.

290
00:14:52,203 --> 00:14:55,074
There are some very exciting things.
Joel?

291
00:14:55,245 --> 00:14:56,969
<i>Singing the Blues.</i>

292
00:14:57,134 --> 00:15:00,845
The dysfunctional Blue family
rises to a position of prominence...

293
00:15:01,007 --> 00:15:03,561
...in a small New England town.

294
00:15:03,728 --> 00:15:07,374
- Very, very powerful. And I--
- Was that a drama or a comedy?

295
00:15:07,538 --> 00:15:10,769
It's a comedy because it's--
They're dysfunctional.

296
00:15:10,932 --> 00:15:12,623
The whole family's dysfunctional.

297
00:15:12,789 --> 00:15:15,375
The father doesn't know.
The kids don't know. Nobody knows!

298
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:18,193
Nobody knows what's going
because of the whole dysfunction.

299
00:15:18,359 --> 00:15:20,531
And that's-- That's the beauty of that.

300
00:15:22,969 --> 00:15:26,516
Simon, all I'm saying is I want it
to be brighter. That's all I'm saying to you.

301
00:15:26,682 --> 00:15:29,531
I want to come in the room
and I wanna see an object like the--

302
00:15:29,692 --> 00:15:34,550
Like a chair or a light or a sofa
and be able to make out what it is.

303
00:15:34,718 --> 00:15:36,125
- Do you understand me?
- I get it.

304
00:15:36,287 --> 00:15:37,814
If you get it, then you turn it up.

305
00:15:37,984 --> 00:15:42,208
Look, I know my job is to translate
your vision into the real world, okay?

306
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:44,193
But the problem is, I don't see a vision.

307
00:15:44,354 --> 00:15:46,045
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah, sure.

308
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:49,115
Do you know how tight my aperture is
right now? Have you any idea?

309
00:15:49,284 --> 00:15:52,068
If you're being a smart-ass,
I'm gonna put you across my knee.

310
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,474
I want it to be bright.

311
00:15:53,638 --> 00:15:56,836
It's bright. It's brighter than
Stephen bloody Hawking in here.

312
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:59,553
- Up, up, up. Just turn it up for me.
- All right. Fine.

313
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,536
- Thank you. Thank you.
- You're the boss. You're the boss.

314
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:04,609
- Whole way.
- That's all there is.

315
00:16:04,779 --> 00:16:06,951
- There you go. Look at that. Lovely.
- I love this.

316
00:16:07,116 --> 00:16:09,539
I love it because I look and I go,
"Hey, it's a room."

317
00:16:09,709 --> 00:16:11,565
It's a sports stadium, is what it is now.

318
00:16:12,047 --> 00:16:13,094
You're so European.

319
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:16,047
There's something about you
that's just foreign.

320
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:19,209
Have you ever been to--?
You travel a lot or...?

321
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:22,445
No, I've-- I haven't been
out of the United States, actually.

322
00:16:23,251 --> 00:16:25,292
Who is your--?
Who is your acting coach again?

323
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,151
- Leonid Kazovskich.
- Oh, she's good.

324
00:16:27,317 --> 00:16:29,358
- She's amazing.
- He, it's a he.

325
00:16:29,526 --> 00:16:33,489
Wasn't she the one that made her students
have nervous breakdowns?

326
00:16:33,655 --> 00:16:35,030
- He, and yeah.
- Oh, it was a he.

327
00:16:35,193 --> 00:16:37,430
It wasn't really necessarily
a nervous breakdown...

328
00:16:37,593 --> 00:16:40,245
...it was more of, you know,
he would just break you down.

329
00:16:40,411 --> 00:16:42,583
- You know, get rid of everything.
- Well, they're--

330
00:16:42,747 --> 00:16:46,098
- That's not the thing out here, is it?
- It's a breath of fresh air out here.

331
00:16:46,269 --> 00:16:48,605
- It's really not.
- At least that's intense and real.

332
00:16:48,766 --> 00:16:50,676
I mean, out here it's like
magazine people.

333
00:16:50,847 --> 00:16:52,539
Here it's all soda pop and blue jeans.

334
00:16:52,704 --> 00:16:55,738
Excuse me, guys. Fifteen minutes,
we'll be ready for you on set.

335
00:16:55,905 --> 00:16:58,394
Could you instead of
referring to me as "guys"...

336
00:16:58,562 --> 00:17:01,247
...could you refer to me by
my character name, Mary Pat?

337
00:17:01,795 --> 00:17:02,974
- Sure.
- Great.

338
00:17:03,141 --> 00:17:04,351
- Sure.
- That's great.

339
00:17:04,517 --> 00:17:07,039
- I apologize.
- No, no. Apology accepted.

340
00:17:07,206 --> 00:17:09,957
It helps me. I appreciate it.

341
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:18,694
Move that up about another 5 feet.
Yeah, straight on up. That's good.

342
00:17:18,891 --> 00:17:20,550
- How's it going, mate?
- Good.

343
00:17:20,716 --> 00:17:22,058
Excuse me. Sorry.

344
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,571
- So much food and nothing to eat.
- Yeah. Absolutely.

345
00:17:25,743 --> 00:17:27,467
What waste.

346
00:17:28,399 --> 00:17:31,183
Ever notice, like, a kind of
a weird smell around here?

347
00:17:31,345 --> 00:17:34,096
It's like-- It's just in this area.
It's kind of a...

348
00:17:35,314 --> 00:17:36,559
I don't know. Maybe it's me.

349
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:40,466
Well, my father would say,
"A fox smells his own hole first."

350
00:17:43,895 --> 00:17:45,357
Simon...

351
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:52,024
...I need to ask you a question,
but I don't want the answer.

352
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:56,468
I'll ask it anyway,
but stop me if you can, all right?

353
00:17:56,636 --> 00:17:58,776
Stop me. Stop me.
How does the film look?

354
00:17:58,941 --> 00:18:01,211
No. Stop me again. How do I look?

355
00:18:01,374 --> 00:18:03,742
- You didn't stop me.
- No. I can stop you now.

356
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,813
- You look absolutely amazing.
- Okay, good.

357
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:08,025
I'm sorry I asked.
I didn't mean to bother you.

358
00:18:08,193 --> 00:18:09,371
- No, please.
- No, I mean...

359
00:18:09,537 --> 00:18:12,670
That's enough. I don't need any--
That's good. I'm glad to hear it.

360
00:18:12,835 --> 00:18:14,297
- Oh, you know what?
- So it's good?

361
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:19,205
I forgot to mention. My girlfriend
was on the Internet last weekend...

362
00:18:19,462 --> 00:18:22,016
...and she was checking out
her specialty sites.

363
00:18:22,183 --> 00:18:25,184
Anyway, she got bored with that
and ended up...

364
00:18:25,352 --> 00:18:27,393
...on one of the movie gossip things,
you know.

365
00:18:27,561 --> 00:18:31,589
Filmtattle.com
or one of those celluloid...

366
00:18:31,755 --> 00:18:33,643
- Do you ever go on those?
- I wouldn't know.

367
00:18:33,804 --> 00:18:36,358
Well, anyway,
the long and the short of it is...

368
00:18:36,525 --> 00:18:39,657
...some bloke got on the set...

369
00:18:39,822 --> 00:18:43,599
...and he reckons there could be an
Academy Award nomination in the offing.

370
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,063
And more specifically,
he said that he thought...

371
00:18:46,226 --> 00:18:49,358
...your performance
was likely to get recognized.

372
00:18:49,651 --> 00:18:52,140
You know, come the announcements.

373
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:56,242
Anyway, thought I'd just share that,
for whatever it's worth.

374
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,895
See you out there.

375
00:19:00,216 --> 00:19:02,737
All right, everybody, back to work.

376
00:19:06,618 --> 00:19:08,277
- Whitney Taylor Brown.
- Yes.

377
00:19:08,443 --> 00:19:09,621
That's a lot of names.

378
00:19:11,356 --> 00:19:13,528
So you're a producer.

379
00:19:13,693 --> 00:19:15,963
A woman producer.

380
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:18,203
What does a producer do?

381
00:19:18,368 --> 00:19:20,889
Well, as my assistant, Lincoln,
can tell you...

382
00:19:21,056 --> 00:19:23,741
...there's a lot of telephone calls
and, you know...

383
00:19:23,906 --> 00:19:30,138
...lots of getting out the wallet and paying
for sometimes ridiculous things like--

384
00:19:30,308 --> 00:19:31,967
Like snacks.

385
00:19:34,022 --> 00:19:36,478
Let's go back
to the beginning of your career.

386
00:19:36,647 --> 00:19:38,753
You are-- Your family is
in the diaper business?

387
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,026
Yes. Brown Diaper Service.

388
00:19:41,193 --> 00:19:44,544
And what exactly did they do
with the diapers?

389
00:19:44,714 --> 00:19:48,906
Well, they picked up the diapers
in big trucks...

390
00:19:49,068 --> 00:19:52,266
...and then we washed them...

391
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,853
...and then gave them back
to the people.

392
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:58,597
That's neat. Thank you so much.

393
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,254
- We're done? We're done.
- Yeah, we're done.

394
00:20:01,426 --> 00:20:03,020
All of it's done.

395
00:20:03,187 --> 00:20:05,293
Don't you wanna know more about me?

396
00:20:05,716 --> 00:20:09,100
Yeah, but we-- I don't--
We don't have time right now, so...

397
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:12,118
Thank you, though,
for talking to us and...

398
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:15,379
I don't want anyone to know
what I look like from the back...

399
00:20:15,545 --> 00:20:18,164
...so I don't want anyone to film my exit.

400
00:20:18,329 --> 00:20:20,370
Okay, it's off. It's not even on.

401
00:20:20,539 --> 00:20:22,362
All right.

402
00:20:23,131 --> 00:20:25,336
First of all, it's been so creative for us.

403
00:20:25,501 --> 00:20:27,957
Every aspect of the movie,
I think, is represented.

404
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:30,232
I hope you like it as much
as we liked doing it.

405
00:20:30,399 --> 00:20:33,150
The first, of course,
is a sort of Norman Rockwell.

406
00:20:33,312 --> 00:20:34,971
It's America. It's the family eating.

407
00:20:36,418 --> 00:20:39,550
You have the title in the Hebraic letters.

408
00:20:39,714 --> 00:20:43,742
All right, well, my first instinct says
it reminds me of my family.

409
00:20:43,908 --> 00:20:45,502
- Which we--
- And I hate my family.

410
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:48,191
And I think a lot of people
might feel that way.

411
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:53,891
I think that's such a fascinating take
on what we've done...

412
00:20:54,057 --> 00:20:57,987
...because we've gotten away
from the family...

413
00:20:58,155 --> 00:20:59,465
...and we make it this.

414
00:21:00,748 --> 00:21:02,057
Man, that one is scary.

415
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,912
You got disembodied heads.

416
00:21:04,077 --> 00:21:07,374
You know what I like?
I like when it's misleading in a good way.

417
00:21:07,535 --> 00:21:09,096
This looks like a horror film.

418
00:21:09,264 --> 00:21:12,494
It's horrifying, but like,
it's horrifying like a horror movie.

419
00:21:12,657 --> 00:21:15,375
Someone's killed their children
and made them into cookies...

420
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:17,001
...and I wanna go see that.

421
00:21:17,171 --> 00:21:19,244
Oh, okay. This was also trying to be...

422
00:21:19,412 --> 00:21:22,828
...a kind of family kind of presentation,
kind of a comedy thing, but--

423
00:21:22,997 --> 00:21:26,479
What's creepy about this one is how
y'all made it where they eyes follow you.

424
00:21:26,647 --> 00:21:29,715
That's scary.
Everywhere you go, they follow you.

425
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,736
You actually do want that in a poster...

426
00:21:31,897 --> 00:21:34,517
...because when you set the posters
in the theater...

427
00:21:34,683 --> 00:21:37,531
...as people walk by, you want that,
you actually do want that.

428
00:21:37,691 --> 00:21:39,481
I'm really glad that you picked that up.

429
00:21:39,645 --> 00:21:42,068
That's what we're trying to do
with both the visual...

430
00:21:42,237 --> 00:21:44,060
...and maybe even something
with the eyes.

431
00:21:44,222 --> 00:21:47,038
And, of course, this is just a gay romp.

432
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,852
- It's a party. It's fun.
- You also see the wistfulness here.

433
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:51,709
What's good about this is it's real.

434
00:21:51,874 --> 00:21:53,915
It's very real.
I've been to a party before...

435
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:57,914
...where people's heads
were actually on the balloons.

436
00:21:58,085 --> 00:22:00,639
I wanna go to this party.
This is a party I would go to...

437
00:22:00,806 --> 00:22:03,392
- Okay, great.
- ...because it's got balloons with colors.

438
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:08,101
This is so stupid and I'm sorry
to bother you, but I just wondered...

439
00:22:08,266 --> 00:22:09,793
There's something on the Internet.

440
00:22:09,962 --> 00:22:13,411
Somebody had been on the set,
here, at <i>Home for Purim</i>...

441
00:22:13,579 --> 00:22:17,061
...and brought up the idea
of there being...

442
00:22:17,229 --> 00:22:22,020
...a possibility of a nomination
for an Oscar.

443
00:22:23,087 --> 00:22:25,292
It's nothing, no big--
It's a big deal. Who cares?

444
00:22:25,456 --> 00:22:28,174
I mean, it's no big deal.
It's nothing. Forget it.

445
00:22:28,337 --> 00:22:29,385
- Forget I said it.
- Okay.

446
00:22:29,554 --> 00:22:31,246
- I just thought, because...
- All right.

447
00:22:31,411 --> 00:22:33,868
...if you Googled Simon Whitset,
apparently, you could--

448
00:22:34,037 --> 00:22:37,715
Okay, this is a rumor that's out there
on the Internet and you think it's nothing.

449
00:22:37,878 --> 00:22:43,380
Tell you what. I'm gonna look into it.
This could be very interesting indeed.

450
00:22:43,545 --> 00:22:47,343
Okay, quick question. The Internet.
That's the one with e-mail, right?

451
00:22:47,514 --> 00:22:49,817
- Yes.
- Got it. I'm on it.

452
00:22:52,285 --> 00:22:55,188
- Why, did I get--? I had some salad.
- You're good.

453
00:22:55,358 --> 00:22:57,246
Philip. Lane, Lane,
Philip, Philip, Philip.

454
00:22:57,406 --> 00:22:59,130
- Hi.
- Hello.

455
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:02,909
- Tell me. <i>Purim</i>. Writers.
- <i>Purim.</i>

456
00:23:03,073 --> 00:23:04,186
- You're writers.
- Yes.

457
00:23:04,354 --> 00:23:05,816
<i>Home for Purim.</i>

458
00:23:05,987 --> 00:23:09,982
This is probably the most personal play
that we've written.

459
00:23:10,148 --> 00:23:12,254
There are elements of my family life.

460
00:23:12,421 --> 00:23:15,073
Purim is strictly your territory.
I didn't know what it was.

461
00:23:15,239 --> 00:23:17,443
I thought Purim meant "a face."
Cute little Purim.

462
00:23:17,607 --> 00:23:19,463
- That's a <i>punim</i>.
- You straightened me out.

463
00:23:19,624 --> 00:23:21,698
It's the one in the shack,
where the shrubs--?

464
00:23:21,866 --> 00:23:24,714
No, no, no, that's <i>Sukkot, Sukkot</i>.

465
00:23:24,874 --> 00:23:27,112
No, Purim, a lot of people
don't really know.

466
00:23:27,275 --> 00:23:31,717
I mean, I didn't know that much
about Purim, but I like Purim a lot.

467
00:23:31,885 --> 00:23:34,886
And it's got a tremendous amount
of symbolic...

468
00:23:35,055 --> 00:23:37,293
...and metaphorical resonance
wrapped up in there.

469
00:23:37,456 --> 00:23:39,213
- You like writing?
- We love to write.

470
00:23:39,377 --> 00:23:41,745
- That's great.
- We would write if they didn't pay us.

471
00:23:41,906 --> 00:23:43,499
And guess what, they usually don't.

472
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:45,456
- Some--
- That's why we're still teaching.

473
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,530
We write just enough
to keep us in teaching.

474
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,042
- Put it that way.
- Yeah, yeah.

475
00:23:49,205 --> 00:23:51,923
- Let me just throw something at you.
- Okay, okay.

476
00:23:52,087 --> 00:23:55,568
Philip, what is your favorite place?

477
00:23:57,785 --> 00:24:00,175
I'd say Chicago.

478
00:24:00,346 --> 00:24:01,753
Lane?

479
00:24:02,139 --> 00:24:04,693
Under my mother's dining room table.

480
00:24:09,054 --> 00:24:11,870
She's here, Daddy!
She's coming up the walk!

481
00:24:18,145 --> 00:24:21,213
- Hey, sis.
- Hey, little brother.

482
00:24:21,891 --> 00:24:24,161
Look at you, all decked out
in Uncle Sam's finest.

483
00:24:24,324 --> 00:24:27,839
Well, if Tojo wants a fight,
a fight he's gonna get.

484
00:24:28,326 --> 00:24:31,327
- Hello, Daddy.
- Ruchel.

485
00:24:32,648 --> 00:24:36,261
My, my, you're a sight for sore eyes.

486
00:24:38,058 --> 00:24:43,428
Daddy, Sam, I'd like you to meet my...

487
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:47,820
My friend Mary Pat Hooligan.

488
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:52,912
- Well, welcome to our home.
- Thank you.

489
00:24:53,073 --> 00:24:54,153
How's Mama?

490
00:24:55,281 --> 00:24:56,591
Rachel?

491
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:01,488
Mama.

492
00:25:04,598 --> 00:25:06,289
We're late, I think.

493
00:25:06,454 --> 00:25:09,008
It was nice of you
to keep my sister company on this trip.

494
00:25:09,176 --> 00:25:12,025
I love Rachel.
We don't spend a lot of time apart.

495
00:25:13,114 --> 00:25:14,641
Do you two live near each other?

496
00:25:15,802 --> 00:25:21,817
Well, if you call sleeping in the same bed
"near each other," I suppose we do.

497
00:25:21,981 --> 00:25:24,284
Well, that just don't make no sense.

498
00:25:25,343 --> 00:25:28,541
Sam, I love your sister.

499
00:25:28,704 --> 00:25:30,712
- And cut.
- That's a cut!

500
00:25:30,881 --> 00:25:32,704
- Okay, that was the best one.
- Hold it.

501
00:25:32,866 --> 00:25:33,914
Okay, all right. Yeah.

502
00:25:34,083 --> 00:25:36,123
Everybody stay where they are, okay?

503
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:40,771
I thought that was great.
Victor, come on out.

504
00:25:41,093 --> 00:25:43,233
I thought that was fantastic.
I mean, you know.

505
00:25:43,399 --> 00:25:45,571
I didn't think it was exactly
as it should be.

506
00:25:45,735 --> 00:25:48,584
- Stinks.
- Tell me what's going on.

507
00:25:48,745 --> 00:25:50,819
Okay, I'm just not feeling--
I'm not feeling it.

508
00:25:50,986 --> 00:25:54,183
I feel like it's ambiguous.
I don't think it's clear that I'm gay.

509
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:57,547
I mean, I got the look,
but I just think that we're...

510
00:25:57,708 --> 00:25:59,684
- ...pussy-footing around--
- Excuse me?

511
00:25:59,854 --> 00:26:01,611
- That makes you sound gay.
- If I say--?

512
00:26:01,775 --> 00:26:04,329
Let me approach this a different way,
because you're all--

513
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:07,563
There's obviously something that
isn't jelling about what we just did.

514
00:26:07,729 --> 00:26:10,480
- I could be blind. I mean, this walks in--
- No, I understand.

515
00:26:10,675 --> 00:26:14,833
Okay, time, time.
Look, this is just... It's just paper.

516
00:26:14,996 --> 00:26:20,879
It's paper and they put a letter and a name
and a word and then they called it a script.

517
00:26:21,047 --> 00:26:22,357
But you know what? I'd be--

518
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,790
Let's toss this away.
Let's start from scratch.

519
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:28,057
- Oh, Jesus.
- What would you do?

520
00:26:28,218 --> 00:26:30,008
Okay.

521
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:33,271
- Where's Whitney? Where's Whitney?
- We don't care about the script.

522
00:26:33,468 --> 00:26:34,745
Here's what I'd like to do.

523
00:26:34,909 --> 00:26:36,820
And I don't mean to be the leader,
but I am.

524
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:39,708
So let's follow me around a circle.
You follow around.

525
00:26:39,871 --> 00:26:42,555
And we kept going.
And remember the mumbling we did.

526
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,504
My name is Sam Pischer.
I'm stationed in the Galápagos Islands.

527
00:26:45,666 --> 00:26:47,489
And we stop. It's like musical chairs...

528
00:26:48,323 --> 00:26:51,936
Are you seeing this? What is this about?
What is this about?

529
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,475
Why is the script on the floor?

530
00:26:53,637 --> 00:26:55,460
- It's upsetting.
- What's this about?

531
00:26:55,622 --> 00:26:59,072
You're another person. You're Debbie.
You're Brian. Say those lines.

532
00:26:59,239 --> 00:27:00,287
- I'm Vic?
- Say her lines.

533
00:27:00,456 --> 00:27:01,504
- Say his lines.
- I'm Sam.

534
00:27:01,673 --> 00:27:03,910
- Just a couple of words.
- We have to speak--

535
00:27:04,074 --> 00:27:06,180
Well, I'm gonna talk to Jay.
I'm gonna get him.

536
00:27:06,347 --> 00:27:07,941
- Lincoln.
- Yeah, yeah, Miss Brown?

537
00:27:08,108 --> 00:27:11,721
- Lincoln, I need to talk to Jay right away.
- All right. That director dude, right?

538
00:27:11,885 --> 00:27:13,162
- Yes.
- All right.

539
00:27:13,326 --> 00:27:15,629
I'm gonna shoot this again
and there's no script.

540
00:27:15,791 --> 00:27:18,159
I don't even want to know
what's happening. What?

541
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,695
Whitney wants to see you.

542
00:27:19,856 --> 00:27:22,640
- I'll be out in a second.
- No, she needs to see you right now.

543
00:27:22,802 --> 00:27:25,673
Okay. I'll be right back.
We're gonna continue this.

544
00:27:25,843 --> 00:27:29,838
I want you to do some exercise.
All of you guys, you pick this up, okay?

545
00:27:30,005 --> 00:27:32,756
- Let's go.
- I'm Mary Pat Hooligan...

546
00:27:33,623 --> 00:27:38,546
- Jay? Here.
- ...I'm Irish and I'm a freaking lesbo.

547
00:27:38,873 --> 00:27:41,263
- I just want to-- Hi. Hi.
- Jay.

548
00:27:41,434 --> 00:27:42,579
So, what's going on?

549
00:27:42,746 --> 00:27:45,202
Well, Philip Kuntz and Lane Iverson
both have a problem.

550
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:47,707
- Koontz.
- Koontz.

551
00:27:48,829 --> 00:27:52,311
We were a little bit disturbed when
we saw you throw the script on the floor...

552
00:27:52,479 --> 00:27:54,935
...because the actors were asking
legitimate questions--

553
00:27:55,104 --> 00:27:58,488
It was a way to motivate them.
It was a way to get them thinking:

554
00:27:58,658 --> 00:28:00,993
- "Oh, <i>spilkes</i>, something happening."
- Hey, look.

555
00:28:01,187 --> 00:28:03,806
I don't want to throw the baby out
with the bathwater.

556
00:28:03,972 --> 00:28:05,860
You'll get a wet, critically-injured baby.

557
00:28:06,021 --> 00:28:07,963
That's not what
you want to put your name on.

558
00:28:08,133 --> 00:28:09,082
- Good point.
- Well-put.

559
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:10,629
I think you've lost your minds.

560
00:28:10,791 --> 00:28:12,931
I don't think you understood
what was happening.

561
00:28:13,096 --> 00:28:15,552
Those exercises,
the things we were doing, the thing--

562
00:28:15,721 --> 00:28:17,926
You need to light a fire under an actor--

563
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:20,163
It seemed like you were
dodging the questions...

564
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:22,568
...the legitimate questions
the actors were asking.

565
00:28:22,731 --> 00:28:24,772
- Lane?
- You were saying, "I don't really know."

566
00:28:24,941 --> 00:28:26,371
Didn't say it out loud. In here.

567
00:28:26,541 --> 00:28:29,543
"I don't know, but I'll have them
walk in a circle and change hats."

568
00:28:29,711 --> 00:28:31,719
- But what about me?
- Lane.

569
00:28:32,464 --> 00:28:34,986
I am not dodging your questions.
I'm trying to--

570
00:28:35,154 --> 00:28:37,064
We're having a conversation here,
all right?

571
00:28:37,235 --> 00:28:39,570
I'm just saying,
don't provoke the situation.

572
00:28:39,731 --> 00:28:41,259
Me, don't provoke?

573
00:28:41,844 --> 00:28:44,911
We didn't walk on in the middle
of the scene and say, "Don't do this."

574
00:28:45,077 --> 00:28:46,223
- Yes, we did.
- We did.

575
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:47,667
Right.

576
00:28:50,231 --> 00:28:51,344
Marilyn--

577
00:28:51,512 --> 00:28:53,782
- Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
- Every time.

578
00:28:53,946 --> 00:28:56,816
I'm sorry. I wanted to let you know
you're wrapped for the day.

579
00:28:56,987 --> 00:29:00,185
- No, I have another scene.
- They just said that you're all done.

580
00:29:00,348 --> 00:29:02,935
Of course they did.
Next time, they'll tell me.

581
00:29:03,102 --> 00:29:04,629
I'll make sure they do. I'm sorry.

582
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:06,457
- And your name is...?
- Sam.

583
00:29:06,623 --> 00:29:09,591
No, it isn't. No, it isn't.
That's not what I've been calling you.

584
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,419
I know, you've been calling me Brian.

585
00:29:11,585 --> 00:29:13,277
- Because your name is Brian.
- It's Sam.

586
00:29:13,442 --> 00:29:16,826
I'm so sorry, Sam. I love you.
I love--!

587
00:29:16,996 --> 00:29:18,338
- Sam.
- Sam! I love Sam!

588
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,449
Thank you.

589
00:29:19,621 --> 00:29:21,247
- Sorry, Sam.
- It's okay.

590
00:29:21,414 --> 00:29:23,717
You work the computers
in the AD wagon, I've noticed.

591
00:29:23,879 --> 00:29:25,919
- Yes.
- So you know about these movie sites...

592
00:29:26,087 --> 00:29:28,641
...where they go to sets
and talk about them on computers.

593
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:30,565
- Sure.
- Why am I telling you this?

594
00:29:30,729 --> 00:29:33,316
But it seems my name
has been mentioned...

595
00:29:33,483 --> 00:29:35,491
...with reference to an Oscar nomination.

596
00:29:35,692 --> 00:29:38,027
- Wow, that's exciting.
- Oh, big deal.

597
00:29:38,189 --> 00:29:40,972
- That's exciting.
- But-- Yeah, so I just...

598
00:29:41,134 --> 00:29:43,786
You might have known
or seen such a thing.

599
00:29:43,952 --> 00:29:45,960
Would you like me to do
some research for you?

600
00:29:46,129 --> 00:29:47,077
- If you want to.
- Sure.

601
00:29:47,281 --> 00:29:49,005
- Wonderful.
- I'll let you know tomorrow.

602
00:29:49,169 --> 00:29:50,795
- Big deal, but if you can--?
- Okay.

603
00:29:50,962 --> 00:29:52,108
- Say your name again.
- Sam.

604
00:29:52,275 --> 00:29:53,802
- Sam. Thank you, Sam.
- My pleasure.

605
00:29:53,971 --> 00:29:55,281
- Thank you, Sam.
- Okay.

606
00:29:55,444 --> 00:29:56,688
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

607
00:29:56,852 --> 00:30:00,050
Oscar. It would be in reference to Oscar.
Are you still there, Sam?

608
00:30:00,214 --> 00:30:02,004
- I'm here. I'll look it up. Oscar.
- Okay.

609
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:03,116
- Wonderful.
- Great.

610
00:30:03,287 --> 00:30:05,361
- If you can. Not a big deal. Who cares?
- Okay.

611
00:30:11,227 --> 00:30:14,807
Oh, Marilyn, wow. Okay.

612
00:30:15,229 --> 00:30:18,776
No, stop it. Stop it, dear.
Let it go, let it go.

613
00:30:19,262 --> 00:30:21,500
Don't think about it.

614
00:30:22,881 --> 00:30:25,565
Oh, an Oscar. Oh, okay.

615
00:30:25,729 --> 00:30:29,626
No, thank you. Just-- I just love the work.

616
00:30:29,795 --> 00:30:32,579
It's enough for me. It really is.
It really is. Really is.

617
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:35,163
It's enough. It's enough. It's plenty.

618
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:38,302
Oh, God, it's plenty.
You're lucky to be alive.

619
00:30:39,591 --> 00:30:42,276
<i>And now, Chuck Porter and Cindy Martin.</i>

620
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:45,126
Well, the much-awaited,
star-studded Hollywood epic...

621
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:47,560
<i>...The Pride of Plymouth Rock</i>
opens soon...

622
00:30:47,723 --> 00:30:51,205
...and this is one film every patriotic
American has been waiting for.

623
00:30:51,373 --> 00:30:52,617
I'll tell you what, Chuck.

624
00:30:52,781 --> 00:30:55,914
Its two megastars,
Cynthia Chapman and Jim Beyman...

625
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:58,316
...may command the highest salaries
in Hollywood...

626
00:30:58,479 --> 00:31:03,271
...but can all that money buy them
a coveted Best Actor and Actress award?

627
00:31:07,508 --> 00:31:10,160
Oh, look, Daniel.

628
00:31:10,517 --> 00:31:14,096
Gaze upon this bountiful
and beauteous place.

629
00:31:14,615 --> 00:31:16,852
The Lord hath surely guided us
to this New World...

630
00:31:17,016 --> 00:31:21,361
...so that we may till its fertile soil
and plant the seeds of a new life.

631
00:31:21,625 --> 00:31:25,239
Oh, Daniel, let us seize
this glorious moment, now and forever...

632
00:31:25,404 --> 00:31:28,788
...and commit ourselves to do his service
and to love each other, you and I.

633
00:31:31,325 --> 00:31:33,236
I love you, Sarah.

634
00:31:33,855 --> 00:31:35,284
And I you.

635
00:31:38,433 --> 00:31:42,210
<i>Wow, well, I say, dust off the mantle,</i>
<i>Jim and Cynthia.</i>

636
00:31:42,371 --> 00:31:44,160
<i>This could be your year.</i>

637
00:31:44,323 --> 00:31:47,259
<i>That film has a budget of almost</i>
<i>300 million.</i>

638
00:31:47,429 --> 00:31:51,621
<i>My gosh, just how much does</i>
<i>a funny-looking hat cost anyway?</i>

639
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:56,135
- Liz.
- Hey! Hi!

640
00:31:57,417 --> 00:31:59,873
You look so good.
I'm so glad you could make it tonight.

641
00:32:00,042 --> 00:32:01,504
- Oh, me too.
- Thank you.

642
00:32:01,675 --> 00:32:04,043
I finally get off early and you're here.
I'm so happy.

643
00:32:04,204 --> 00:32:07,272
- You look beautiful.
- Oh, thank you.

644
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:13,295
Thanks. You know, I'm glowing
because I have very big news.

645
00:32:13,456 --> 00:32:14,405
What?

646
00:32:14,577 --> 00:32:18,353
First, you're never gonna guess
who I ran into today.

647
00:32:18,675 --> 00:32:21,873
I went to Shoe Barn
because I wanted to get a strappy sandal...

648
00:32:22,036 --> 00:32:25,004
...something open-toed and kind of sexy,
kind of loose.

649
00:32:25,173 --> 00:32:28,720
And you'll never believe
who was the salesman.

650
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:30,257
Take a wild guess.

651
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,310
Your gynecologist.

652
00:32:32,952 --> 00:32:37,232
No. Zach. From <i>Sisters of Stone</i>?

653
00:32:37,402 --> 00:32:39,291
- Remember?
- I'll never remember, but go on.

654
00:32:39,452 --> 00:32:42,388
He's running naked through tombstones.
He finds out he's gay.

655
00:32:42,557 --> 00:32:45,013
- It's a full moon and he--
- Sort of. Is he still acting?

656
00:32:45,182 --> 00:32:49,242
No, he's selling shoes,
but we just had this incredible connection.

657
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:51,318
He was cradling my instep
and looked me in--

658
00:32:51,489 --> 00:32:52,919
Oh, the one with the breath.

659
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:55,582
The one with the breath.
How was it today?

660
00:32:55,746 --> 00:32:58,879
He'd have to have had his guts removed
and his teeth to have it better.

661
00:32:59,044 --> 00:33:00,987
- Does he still stink?
- He doesn't, he's fine.

662
00:33:01,157 --> 00:33:02,564
God, that was the smell of sin.

663
00:33:03,173 --> 00:33:06,852
It was. But he's-- So he looks good?

664
00:33:07,431 --> 00:33:09,920
Yeah. Yeah, he looks good.

665
00:33:10,089 --> 00:33:12,130
Well, he was at your feet.

666
00:33:13,066 --> 00:33:14,693
Not up...

667
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:17,227
It's a good thing
he's not a hat salesman.

668
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:21,549
I had some wonderful news today too.

669
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:24,646
What?

670
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,019
What is it?

671
00:33:28,689 --> 00:33:30,861
I think I might get nominated
for an Oscar.

672
00:33:31,026 --> 00:33:35,468
Oh, my God! Oh, my...
Oh, my God.

673
00:33:35,636 --> 00:33:38,288
- Oh, my God.
- Yes!

674
00:33:41,463 --> 00:33:43,154
I could see it. I could see us.

675
00:33:43,575 --> 00:33:45,551
A little piece of land,
far away from here...

676
00:33:45,721 --> 00:33:47,827
...you teaching acting class
somewhere in town--

677
00:33:47,994 --> 00:33:50,329
- No, that's too far.
- What?

678
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:52,880
The fantasy had gone too far?

679
00:33:59,583 --> 00:34:01,438
It wasn't the apple in the tree...

680
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,463
...but the pear on the ground
that caused all the trouble.

681
00:34:05,889 --> 00:34:06,838
Morning, kids.

682
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:08,767
- Hi, Corey.
- Hi, Corey.

683
00:34:09,891 --> 00:34:11,802
- Big day?
- For her it is.

684
00:34:11,971 --> 00:34:13,827
She shoots her big scene with Marilyn.

685
00:34:15,013 --> 00:34:16,475
Big day for all of you.

686
00:34:16,646 --> 00:34:20,771
No. I have, like, two exteriors with Victor
and then I'm done.

687
00:34:23,657 --> 00:34:25,119
You haven't heard the rumor?

688
00:34:26,378 --> 00:34:27,327
No.

689
00:34:28,875 --> 00:34:32,554
Do you kids like to use
the World Wide "Interweb"?

690
00:34:32,717 --> 00:34:34,092
The Internet?

691
00:34:37,198 --> 00:34:38,311
- It's the Internet.
- Yep.

692
00:34:38,479 --> 00:34:39,822
We do. We know what it is.

693
00:34:39,984 --> 00:34:43,914
Well, there was an item
published on the--

694
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,511
Internet.

695
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:50,442
--and it mentions very favorably
this little picture...

696
00:34:51,125 --> 00:34:54,803
...and in particular, your colleague,
Marilyn Hack.

697
00:34:55,831 --> 00:34:57,206
- Good for her.
- That's so great.

698
00:34:57,367 --> 00:35:02,737
In further "particularlyness,"
a possible Oscar nomination.

699
00:35:03,098 --> 00:35:04,473
- For Marilyn?
- For Marilyn Hack.

700
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:05,618
That's so cool.

701
00:35:05,787 --> 00:35:07,544
- For <i>Home for Purim</i>?
- <i>Home for Purim.</i>

702
00:35:07,708 --> 00:35:10,098
- That's great.
- That's great for her.

703
00:35:10,909 --> 00:35:12,666
Chew upon that.

704
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:15,002
- See you, Corey.
- Yup.

705
00:35:16,063 --> 00:35:18,268
--days in this scene...
- Oh, my, this is too much.

706
00:35:18,433 --> 00:35:20,605
- ...I need to know the script count...
- Too much.

707
00:35:20,769 --> 00:35:22,493
What? What do you have?

708
00:35:22,658 --> 00:35:26,304
I told you there was a blurb
on the Internet.

709
00:35:26,468 --> 00:35:27,843
- Oh, did you get it?
- I did.

710
00:35:28,005 --> 00:35:31,268
- Tell me.
- That lovely AD printed it off.

711
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:33,023
- They can do that now.
- On his own!

712
00:35:33,191 --> 00:35:34,981
- On some connection?
- He has a machine...

713
00:35:35,144 --> 00:35:37,698
- ...and a cord right out of his computer.
- To a printer?

714
00:35:37,865 --> 00:35:39,360
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Amazing.

715
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:42,084
And now I have it here on paper.
Real paper.

716
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:44,548
It's short, but it's powerful.

717
00:35:44,716 --> 00:35:46,244
"Marilyn shines in <i>Home for Purim</i>.

718
00:35:46,413 --> 00:35:48,552
The role of Esther,
like her biblical namesake...

719
00:35:48,717 --> 00:35:50,791
...is laden with the riches
of complexity...

720
00:35:50,959 --> 00:35:54,375
...and guilt as old as the parchment
on which the Purim story was written.

721
00:35:54,544 --> 00:35:56,487
- Yes?
- In the hands of anyone less capable...

722
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:58,989
...the casting would be criminal.

723
00:35:59,154 --> 00:36:02,025
But Marilyn Hack is delivering a performance
sculpted by tools...

724
00:36:02,196 --> 00:36:05,263
...in whose hands only the most
experienced craftsmen should handle...

725
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:08,976
...a performance that could only be
described as Oscar-worthy."

726
00:36:09,142 --> 00:36:12,439
Hello. Well, how about
getting it right, for once?

727
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,845
- It's very nice.
- It's crazy.

728
00:36:14,009 --> 00:36:15,700
He's right. I could have written that.

729
00:36:15,865 --> 00:36:17,393
- Did you?
- I could have.

730
00:36:17,562 --> 00:36:19,287
Could have been your nocturnal labors.

731
00:36:19,451 --> 00:36:22,070
What's my nom de plume?
Remind me.

732
00:36:22,396 --> 00:36:25,594
It's just a bit silly about the Oscar stuff,
don't you think?

733
00:36:25,758 --> 00:36:28,061
Silly? It's the backbone of this industry.

734
00:36:28,223 --> 00:36:30,133
An industry noted
for not having a backbone.

735
00:36:30,304 --> 00:36:32,607
The problem is, there's not enough
pageantry anymore.

736
00:36:32,769 --> 00:36:34,558
People want pizzazz,
they want pageantry.

737
00:36:34,721 --> 00:36:38,105
They want more red carpet, not less.
And what's wrong with that?

738
00:36:39,524 --> 00:36:43,071
And settle in. Roll sound. Okay. Rain up.

739
00:36:45,542 --> 00:36:48,162
And action.

740
00:36:51,241 --> 00:36:55,651
The air is as heavy
as a magnolia blossom...

741
00:36:55,915 --> 00:37:00,652
...with the weight of a thousand teardrops
on its petal.

742
00:37:01,965 --> 00:37:07,751
If you're waiting for forgiveness, Rachel,
I don't believe I can muster the strength.

743
00:37:08,177 --> 00:37:11,178
It don't much matter now, Mama.

744
00:37:13,202 --> 00:37:17,198
It don't much matter who forgives who.

745
00:37:20,565 --> 00:37:22,355
What?

746
00:37:23,863 --> 00:37:26,679
What did I do that was so wrong?

747
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,525
Wanting my daughter to grow up
to be a mama of her own...

748
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:31,763
...with a houseful of babies
and a decent man...

749
00:37:31,931 --> 00:37:34,387
...to cherish and take care of?

750
00:37:34,556 --> 00:37:37,143
You just didn't want the boys around,
Rachel.

751
00:37:37,309 --> 00:37:39,644
What kind of girl
doesn't want to meet a nice fella?

752
00:37:40,479 --> 00:37:43,928
I only invited the best ones over,
the ones whose daddies were professionals.

753
00:37:44,736 --> 00:37:47,039
There wasn't a nebbish in the group.

754
00:37:47,202 --> 00:37:49,953
But you wouldn't have it.
You wouldn't have any of it.

755
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,846
And so you ran.

756
00:37:55,013 --> 00:37:58,462
You ran and tore a chapter
out of your family's life...

757
00:37:59,142 --> 00:38:01,598
...and a piece out of my heart.

758
00:38:02,248 --> 00:38:05,730
I was screaming, Mama,
but you couldn't hear me.

759
00:38:06,186 --> 00:38:08,608
And you couldn't see me
for who I was.

760
00:38:08,779 --> 00:38:11,780
I didn't want your life.
I didn't wanna be in a kitchen...

761
00:38:11,948 --> 00:38:15,430
...with the brisket or the fish balls
or the kreplach or the <i>kugel</i>...

762
00:38:15,598 --> 00:38:18,469
...or go out with boys that turn into men
I don't want to marry.

763
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:20,069
It was all <i>fershteit</i>.

764
00:38:20,496 --> 00:38:22,220
I am not you, Mama.

765
00:38:23,473 --> 00:38:28,658
I am me, Rachel Pischer.

766
00:38:29,363 --> 00:38:33,391
And, oh, yes, I did meet a nice fella.

767
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:37,715
Her name is Mary Pat.

768
00:38:42,842 --> 00:38:46,324
<i>Oy gevalt</i>, what have I done?

769
00:38:55,103 --> 00:38:56,926
- Hi, kids.
- Hi, Corey.

770
00:38:57,088 --> 00:38:59,904
Excuse me. Miss Hack, Miss Hack,
permission to speak with you?

771
00:39:00,065 --> 00:39:03,066
- Of course. How are you on this fine day?
- I'm very well, thank you.

772
00:39:03,234 --> 00:39:06,716
I just got off the phone with
the segment producer from <i>Wake Up L.A.</i>

773
00:39:06,884 --> 00:39:10,049
Guess who they want on their show
tomorrow morning.

774
00:39:10,213 --> 00:39:14,044
- Oh, Corey, you think you're ready?
- No, not me. You.

775
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,357
- Marilyn Hack.
- No.

776
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:18,594
You and Victor Allan Miller.

777
00:39:19,338 --> 00:39:22,022
- Oh, Corey.
- Yeah. Yeah.

778
00:39:24,011 --> 00:39:27,329
You have no idea how difficult it has been
to get people on the phone.

779
00:39:27,501 --> 00:39:28,810
- It was worth it.
- Thank you.

780
00:39:28,973 --> 00:39:30,501
Corey, good job.

781
00:39:30,671 --> 00:39:32,559
See what a little buzz
can do in this town?

782
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:36,747
Just a little bit of buzz, a little bit of
fairy dust and... you're off to the races.

783
00:39:38,706 --> 00:39:42,483
Oh, Victor, incidentally, those radio
auditions have been changed to Friday.

784
00:39:42,644 --> 00:39:44,816
What do you mean, auditions?
Hold on.

785
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,868
- A banana and water, please.
- All right.

786
00:39:47,029 --> 00:39:48,045
- You?
- I don't audition.

787
00:39:48,214 --> 00:39:50,703
- I'm gonna have the corned beef.
- Thank you.

788
00:39:50,871 --> 00:39:53,687
You told me I don't have to
read for commercials. You said that.

789
00:39:53,848 --> 00:39:56,916
I told them that. I said,
"My client should not have to read for this.

790
00:39:57,082 --> 00:39:59,254
I think he's proven himself
time and time again."

791
00:39:59,419 --> 00:40:02,617
- Excellent. So I've got the gig?
- Well, if you read for it.

792
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,439
- Why--?
- I think reading is important.

793
00:40:04,605 --> 00:40:07,094
I don't understand why,
after 40 years in the business...

794
00:40:07,263 --> 00:40:11,006
...I have to read for a freaking radio
commercial in freaking Oregon.

795
00:40:11,168 --> 00:40:14,813
Victor, if you go in and audition, okay,
what you're saying to these guys is:

796
00:40:14,978 --> 00:40:18,241
"Hey, fellas, I know I don't have to
audition for this, but you know what?

797
00:40:18,403 --> 00:40:22,780
I'm going to audition for it, just to show you
why I shouldn't have to audition for it."

798
00:40:22,949 --> 00:40:26,267
Just do me a favor. Let me be
the last person in, if I'm going to do this--

799
00:40:26,438 --> 00:40:28,512
- Gentlemen, pardon the interruption.
- Hi, Corey.

800
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:32,543
Victor, the booking.
Tomorrow morning. <i>Wake Up L.A.</i>

801
00:40:32,713 --> 00:40:35,496
- <i>Wake Up L.A.</i> for Victor?
- For Victor Allan Miller.

802
00:40:35,659 --> 00:40:37,547
- Which is what?
- Which is a morning show.

803
00:40:37,707 --> 00:40:39,049
<i>Wake Up L.A.</i> Wake up.

804
00:40:39,212 --> 00:40:43,044
- I don't have a TV, Morley, as you know--
- Doesn't have a TV. Cherish this client.

805
00:40:43,213 --> 00:40:46,084
One hour infotainment. Variety.
Cohosts: male, female.

806
00:40:46,255 --> 00:40:48,678
Happy addition tomorrow morning,
you and Marilyn Hack.

807
00:40:49,009 --> 00:40:50,602
- Victor, fantastic.
- Congratulations.

808
00:40:50,769 --> 00:40:51,850
Thank you, Mr. Miller.

809
00:40:52,017 --> 00:40:54,474
This ship's turning around.
Thought you'd like to know.

810
00:40:54,642 --> 00:40:56,553
That is so fantastic.

811
00:40:56,724 --> 00:40:59,026
- <i>Wake Up L.A.</i>
- Did I not say--? Am I a mind reader?

812
00:40:59,188 --> 00:41:01,972
- What do you mean?
- <i>Home for Purim.</i> I predicted it.

813
00:41:02,134 --> 00:41:04,240
I said, "This is the one.
This is the vehicle."

814
00:41:04,407 --> 00:41:05,869
Morley, you told me not to do it.

815
00:41:07,384 --> 00:41:10,702
And so a high of 79 in Los Angeles
with a low of 67.

816
00:41:10,874 --> 00:41:14,104
Long Beach is 77 and a low of 65.

817
00:41:14,267 --> 00:41:18,776
Anyway, all around, it's gonna be
a pretty hot day and not very much wind.

818
00:41:18,942 --> 00:41:20,852
Where does wind come from?

819
00:41:21,022 --> 00:41:23,259
Where does wind come from?

820
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,659
I don't know. It just blows around.

821
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,542
That was a complete non sequitur.

822
00:41:27,713 --> 00:41:30,529
We won't worry about it.
We'll go over to Skip and Sanchez.

823
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:33,691
Hello, Skip. Hello, Sanchez.
You look nice today, Sanchez.

824
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,487
Well, thank you very much, Monkey.

825
00:41:35,653 --> 00:41:38,949
Oh, Sanchez, if only...
If only it was your hand and not Nina's.

826
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:41,250
- That's so rude.
- Get in line, get in line.

827
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:43,391
- He always does this.
- Good God.

828
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:48,199
All right. We've got a couple of wonderful
actors coming up on the show this morning.

829
00:41:48,363 --> 00:41:51,364
Miss Marilyn Hack
and Victor Allan Miller.

830
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,570
You know, these two are good.

831
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:57,222
Very tough to do a morning show,
this chitchatty kind of thing.

832
00:41:57,390 --> 00:42:02,149
But these two have an intellect
behind whatever it is they're doing there.

833
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,662
Oh, Skip's a good guy.

834
00:42:03,825 --> 00:42:06,412
He and I worked on
<i>The Jerry Jeckel Show</i> together.

835
00:42:06,578 --> 00:42:09,067
I can't speak for the painted whore
next to him.

836
00:42:09,844 --> 00:42:11,667
Hi, hi, good morning.

837
00:42:11,828 --> 00:42:14,163
In about 30 seconds,
at the end of this break...

838
00:42:14,325 --> 00:42:16,017
- ...you guys are gonna go on.
- Okay.

839
00:42:16,182 --> 00:42:19,347
Now, the seating arrangement
is Mr. Miller is in the middle...

840
00:42:19,511 --> 00:42:22,196
- ...and Miss Heck is next to him.
- Hack.

841
00:42:22,361 --> 00:42:25,177
- Okay, so I'm--?
- Right, so let me show you.

842
00:42:25,338 --> 00:42:27,281
- Mr. Miller is in the middle...
- Yes.

843
00:42:27,451 --> 00:42:29,754
- ...Miss Heck is next to him.
- Hack.

844
00:42:29,917 --> 00:42:31,510
- She's on first?
- That's all right.

845
00:42:31,677 --> 00:42:33,653
- As long as they have the name right.
- Yeah.

846
00:42:33,822 --> 00:42:36,638
- And we're back. <i>Wake Up L.A.</i>
- <i>Wake Up L.A.</i>

847
00:42:36,799 --> 00:42:40,477
- We have two fabulous veteran actors...
- Yes.

848
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:44,384
...that have joined us to talk
about their new movie, <i>Home for</i>--

849
00:42:44,546 --> 00:42:45,495
- We want to--
- <i>Purim.</i>

850
00:42:45,667 --> 00:42:46,616
- <i>Purim.</i>
- <i>Purim.</i>

851
00:42:46,788 --> 00:42:49,374
- That's a Jewish holiday, correct?
- It is a Jewish holiday.

852
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:52,444
It's a wonderful Jewish holiday.
Family, good triumphs over evil.

853
00:42:52,615 --> 00:42:53,728
A wonderful story.

854
00:42:53,894 --> 00:42:56,165
Victor, I want to tell you
that my family and I...

855
00:42:56,328 --> 00:42:58,784
...we stop when your commercials
are running.

856
00:42:58,953 --> 00:43:00,197
Thank you, that's very kind.

857
00:43:00,361 --> 00:43:04,706
Does anybody out there know
Victor's day job as an actor?

858
00:43:04,875 --> 00:43:05,891
- Let him have it.
- I do!

859
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:08,615
- Name of the character?
- This is on the tip of my tongue.

860
00:43:08,781 --> 00:43:10,058
- It's the wiener...
- Yeah.

861
00:43:10,222 --> 00:43:12,590
- Irv the Footlong Wiener!
- The Footlong Wiener, right.

862
00:43:12,751 --> 00:43:14,759
Head of the class.
Told you I'd get one right.

863
00:43:14,928 --> 00:43:17,230
<i>I wanted a wiener</i>
<i>every time I saw your commercials.</i>

864
00:43:17,393 --> 00:43:18,800
- <i>That's the idea.</i>
- <i>Fantastic.</i>

865
00:43:18,961 --> 00:43:21,199
- Good, good.
- <i>And you buy the hot dogs too?</i>

866
00:43:21,394 --> 00:43:24,691
Let me ask you a couple of questions
about <i>Home for Purim</i>.

867
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:28,749
It's a story about a Jewish,
Yiddish family?

868
00:43:28,918 --> 00:43:31,090
- Jewish family.
- Tell us a little about the movie.

869
00:43:31,255 --> 00:43:33,143
- Marilyn, why don't you--?
- Yes, Marilyn.

870
00:43:33,304 --> 00:43:36,950
I just would like a moment
to collect my bearings.

871
00:43:37,113 --> 00:43:38,903
<i>Okay. Can I--? If it's okay with you.</i>

872
00:43:39,067 --> 00:43:41,751
<i>You gave a performance</i>
<i>in</i> Song of Reuben...

873
00:43:41,915 --> 00:43:43,574
Oh, she looks nervous.

874
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:46,294
She's too sensitive for this.
She shouldn't even do that.

875
00:43:46,717 --> 00:43:49,369
You look gorgeous!
I'm calling her on her cell.

876
00:43:49,534 --> 00:43:52,089
I swear, I'm calling her in 10 seconds,
when she goes off.

877
00:43:52,256 --> 00:43:54,810
When they go to commercial break,
I'm calling to tell her.

878
00:43:55,009 --> 00:43:57,760
Yes, Victor!

879
00:43:58,115 --> 00:44:00,156
I don't act for trophies.

880
00:44:00,324 --> 00:44:04,581
I think some people act for trophies.
Some don't.

881
00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:07,590
- This is the range we don't see in actors.
- I hope I don't laugh.

882
00:44:07,751 --> 00:44:10,567
Absolutely not.
Now, Victor, let me ask you something.

883
00:44:11,048 --> 00:44:14,432
Because you are so distinguished
as the wiener...

884
00:44:14,634 --> 00:44:18,792
...do you feel that people
are going to accept you in this role?

885
00:44:18,955 --> 00:44:23,048
Well, if they've seen my theatrical work
over the years, I think they will.

886
00:44:23,213 --> 00:44:27,372
Well, I have to tell you, for my money
and how I feel about it...

887
00:44:27,536 --> 00:44:30,025
...I think you're looking
at an Academy Award nomination.

888
00:44:30,192 --> 00:44:31,502
This is the woman, right here.

889
00:44:31,665 --> 00:44:34,634
No, we know that, but I'm telling you,
I think you can...

890
00:44:34,803 --> 00:44:37,073
- Did he just say what I thought he said?
- What?

891
00:44:37,236 --> 00:44:40,499
Did he just say Oscar buzz at Victor?

892
00:44:40,661 --> 00:44:43,029
He thinks there's gonna be Oscar buzz
around Victor?

893
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:44,435
- That's what he said.
- Great.

894
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:46,934
That's two Oscar nominees.

895
00:44:47,096 --> 00:44:49,781
He said, "Oscar" and "Victor"
in the same breath, didn't he?

896
00:44:49,945 --> 00:44:52,084
- Yes, he did.
- Do you know what this means?

897
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:54,324
- The guy said Victor--
- The man.

898
00:44:54,491 --> 00:44:57,012
- Has to be quiet.
- He thinks Victor's gonna be nominated.

899
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:58,806
- Oscar buzz.
- I need a Selectric.

900
00:44:58,973 --> 00:45:02,488
- Let's send a big gift basket to Victor.
- I need to compose a very long letter.

901
00:45:02,655 --> 00:45:05,438
- Oh, my God, that was...
- Oh, Corey.

902
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:08,635
- My infrastructure had a meltdown!
- No, no, you were perfect.

903
00:45:08,801 --> 00:45:10,493
- Couldn't have done better.
- Don't lie.

904
00:45:10,659 --> 00:45:12,033
- It won't help me.
- I'm not.

905
00:45:12,195 --> 00:45:13,854
I didn't know what I was saying.

906
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:16,671
- Oh, I heard.
- How did he do it?

907
00:45:16,836 --> 00:45:18,812
- Well, he's a natural, okay?
- He is.

908
00:45:18,982 --> 00:45:20,870
You made him look good,
you were so stiff.

909
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:23,901
- I mean, you were a little nervous.
- Stiff? I should be so lucky.

910
00:45:24,072 --> 00:45:25,927
- He was marvelous.
- But you looked pretty.

911
00:45:26,089 --> 00:45:28,031
- She had a sexual feeling to you.
- Thank you.

912
00:45:28,202 --> 00:45:30,625
I'm not used to being a sex object,
more of a food object.

913
00:45:30,795 --> 00:45:32,934
- Get used to it.
- You play the actor so well.

914
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:34,923
- Congratulations.
- You had a quiet drama.

915
00:45:35,084 --> 00:45:36,776
- That was wonderful.
- Sure, thank you.

916
00:45:36,942 --> 00:45:39,179
- Do you know any, like, coaches?
- Come with me.

917
00:45:39,342 --> 00:45:41,285
- Victor, go like this:
- Yeah?

918
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,427
You taste that?

919
00:45:45,713 --> 00:45:47,754
That's the taste of stardom,
my friend.

920
00:45:47,922 --> 00:45:51,469
You're entering a new plateau,
joining the ranks of a very select few.

921
00:45:51,636 --> 00:45:53,328
I know,
I've seen this a hundred times.

922
00:45:53,493 --> 00:45:55,795
I've guided so many actors
to this place.

923
00:45:55,957 --> 00:45:58,992
You are now a star.

924
00:45:59,159 --> 00:46:02,936
You have to start walking and talking
and thinking of yourself as a star.

925
00:46:03,097 --> 00:46:04,210
- Okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

926
00:46:04,378 --> 00:46:07,194
Give Victor Allan Miller fans
the star they've been waiting for.

927
00:46:07,355 --> 00:46:09,014
- Got you, got you.
- Yeah?

928
00:46:10,364 --> 00:46:12,820
In today's "Lost and Found" segment...

929
00:46:12,989 --> 00:46:17,366
...we're going to look at careers that
seemed to be missing for quite some time.

930
00:46:17,536 --> 00:46:21,694
And wouldn't you know it? They both
turned up in exactly the same place.

931
00:46:21,857 --> 00:46:26,911
Marilyn Hack made quite the splash
in <i>Song for Reuben</i> back in 1989...

932
00:46:27,076 --> 00:46:30,143
<i>...for her memorable portrayal</i>
<i>of Imogene the blind prostitute.</i>

933
00:46:30,373 --> 00:46:33,888
Know what they say about blind prostitutes?
You really have to hand it to them.

934
00:46:34,055 --> 00:46:35,746
We can cut that out.

935
00:46:35,911 --> 00:46:38,433
But where did she go? She got lost.

936
00:46:38,601 --> 00:46:41,569
And Victor Allan Miller,
the venerable Broadway veteran...

937
00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:43,909
<i>...best known as</i>
<i>Irv the Footlong Wiener...</i>

938
00:46:44,075 --> 00:46:47,076
<i>...in those amusing commercials</i>
<i>for Felber's Kosher Hot Dogs...</i>

939
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,257
...well, he just up and disappeared.

940
00:46:49,421 --> 00:46:51,495
Until now, Cindy.
They have been found.

941
00:46:51,662 --> 00:46:54,281
And I'm glad to report
they are not only alive and well...

942
00:46:54,447 --> 00:46:56,204
...but more important, they're working.

943
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:00,014
I'll tell you what, Chuck. Both are
starring in the Sunfish Classics feature:

944
00:47:00,178 --> 00:47:02,732
<i>Home for Purim.</i>
And from what we hear...

945
00:47:02,899 --> 00:47:05,650
...they could both be marching
down the red carpet this year.

946
00:47:05,812 --> 00:47:09,196
And Cindy and I will be on the set
of <i>Home for</i>-- How to pronounce?

947
00:47:09,366 --> 00:47:10,576
- Purim.
- <i>Purim</i> tomorrow...

948
00:47:10,742 --> 00:47:13,045
...talking to Marilyn Hack
and Victor Allan Miller...

949
00:47:13,207 --> 00:47:16,525
...and the cast of this hot little movie
that seems to be creating a stir.

950
00:47:16,697 --> 00:47:18,738
We'll have that story
and much more for you...

951
00:47:18,905 --> 00:47:21,241
...on tomorrow night's show.

952
00:47:26,878 --> 00:47:31,189
<i>When Achashverosh heard the news</i>
<i>Of Haman's evil scheme</i>

953
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:34,710
<i>He told his wife Queen Esther</i>
<i>"Don't</i> fabrent

954
00:47:36,449 --> 00:47:40,674
<i>Haman will be punished</i>
<i>And the Jews will all be saved</i>

955
00:47:40,836 --> 00:47:43,739
<i>And you'll</i> shep noches <i>later</i>
<i>In my tent"</i>

956
00:47:45,701 --> 00:47:49,598
<i>Purim, Purim, Purim</i>
<i>It's a time to have some fun</i>

957
00:47:49,767 --> 00:47:54,210
<i>By drowning out the sound</i>
<i>Of Haman's name</i>

958
00:47:54,634 --> 00:47:58,727
<i>Purim, Purim, Purim</i>
<i>Spread the news to everyone</i>

959
00:47:58,988 --> 00:48:04,839
<i>That Mordecai and Esther</i>
<i>Saved the day</i>

960
00:48:11,632 --> 00:48:13,062
- Let's get you back to bed.
- No.

961
00:48:13,522 --> 00:48:16,971
My time is short
and I will not leave the Purim table.

962
00:48:19,092 --> 00:48:23,699
What is it about Purim
that is so special to you, Mama?

963
00:48:24,599 --> 00:48:27,535
I'm an Esther, like the queen.

964
00:48:27,768 --> 00:48:31,511
She was a woman who came
from the worst of times to the best.

965
00:48:31,674 --> 00:48:34,195
To a palace where she had
everything she wanted.

966
00:48:34,587 --> 00:48:37,305
Comfort, riches, power.

967
00:48:37,468 --> 00:48:39,771
And she risked it all,
including her life...

968
00:48:40,189 --> 00:48:41,815
...to serve a higher purpose...

969
00:48:42,270 --> 00:48:45,500
...commit a selfless act
to save a nation.

970
00:48:45,888 --> 00:48:47,798
Your daddy was my king...

971
00:48:48,513 --> 00:48:49,943
...this house, my palace...

972
00:48:50,305 --> 00:48:54,530
...and my selfless act was to protect
my family from all the Hamans.

973
00:48:56,484 --> 00:48:59,802
I don't have much time!
Let's put the toys down!

974
00:49:04,136 --> 00:49:07,847
Only now do I realize the irony...

975
00:49:08,714 --> 00:49:12,130
...that my selfless act
was indeed a selfish one.

976
00:49:13,036 --> 00:49:16,616
Because the Haman I was trying
to protect you from, Rachel...

977
00:49:17,005 --> 00:49:19,592
...turned out to be me.

978
00:49:20,687 --> 00:49:21,865
Mama.

979
00:49:22,224 --> 00:49:23,566
- Mama.
- Mama.

980
00:49:23,728 --> 00:49:25,933
You're no Haman, Mama.

981
00:49:26,226 --> 00:49:30,483
You are... Queen Esther.

982
00:49:34,837 --> 00:49:37,172
- And cut.
- That's a cut.

983
00:49:37,334 --> 00:49:40,270
- Very good, everybody. Very good.
- Thank you very much, everybody.

984
00:49:40,439 --> 00:49:42,644
And we are moving on.

985
00:49:42,809 --> 00:49:44,598
Scene 31, in the kitchen.

986
00:49:44,761 --> 00:49:46,355
- Simon? Simon.
- Yeah?

987
00:49:47,739 --> 00:49:50,195
- Brilliant.
- Do me a favor.

988
00:49:50,364 --> 00:49:54,621
In the next take, extreme close-up
of the kugel, all right?

989
00:49:54,782 --> 00:49:56,539
Make a note of that.

990
00:49:56,703 --> 00:49:58,132
I got it.

991
00:49:58,591 --> 00:50:00,926
- To call attention to...
- I don't alter my reading.

992
00:50:01,088 --> 00:50:03,904
That was terrific, unbelievable.
I loved that. That was great.

993
00:50:04,066 --> 00:50:06,652
Victor? What I want to do is,
I want to come in low.

994
00:50:06,819 --> 00:50:08,893
See your face after lunch.
I want to see your--

995
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:10,751
- Not too low?
- No, not under your chin.

996
00:50:10,917 --> 00:50:12,805
Because I wanna be able
to crosscut after.

997
00:50:12,966 --> 00:50:14,527
- Hello, everyone.
- And Debbie, who--

998
00:50:14,694 --> 00:50:16,997
Everyone, quiet, please.

999
00:50:17,255 --> 00:50:21,447
I have Martin Gibb,
the president of Sunfish Classics.

1000
00:50:21,609 --> 00:50:22,854
- Hi.
- Oh, hello.

1001
00:50:23,018 --> 00:50:25,320
- Victor Allan Miller.
- Hi.

1002
00:50:25,483 --> 00:50:27,142
- This is Marilyn.
- Hi.

1003
00:50:27,499 --> 00:50:29,256
- Marilyn Hack.
- Yeah?

1004
00:50:29,676 --> 00:50:33,355
- And this is the gang.
- I'm Brian Chubb. Nice to see you.

1005
00:50:33,518 --> 00:50:34,696
- Callie Webb.
- Hi.

1006
00:50:36,464 --> 00:50:38,123
The article.

1007
00:50:39,601 --> 00:50:40,779
The article?

1008
00:50:41,394 --> 00:50:43,053
Planet Earth calling.

1009
00:50:43,219 --> 00:50:45,129
Did you get a chance
to see the last take?

1010
00:50:45,492 --> 00:50:48,527
Yeah. Right. <i>Variety.</i>

1011
00:50:48,693 --> 00:50:52,589
So "Star on the Rise" is the headline.

1012
00:50:52,759 --> 00:50:54,865
Okay. "With stellar performances...

1013
00:50:55,032 --> 00:50:58,547
...from its veteran mainstays,
Marilyn Hack and Victor Allan Miller...

1014
00:51:00,058 --> 00:51:02,448
...it is the surprisingly adept
portrayal of Rachel...

1015
00:51:02,619 --> 00:51:05,403
...that could earn Webb
Academy recognition."

1016
00:51:09,822 --> 00:51:11,383
- Made you happy?
- Oh, my God.

1017
00:51:11,551 --> 00:51:14,105
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1018
00:51:15,809 --> 00:51:17,697
- Oh, bye-bye.
- Wow, that's unbelievable.

1019
00:51:17,858 --> 00:51:20,542
- It's gonna be so much fun.
- This is good news for everybody.

1020
00:51:20,707 --> 00:51:23,938
- Bye! Bye, thank you for coming.
- Baby, this is fantastic.

1021
00:51:28,807 --> 00:51:30,695
I just feel like...

1022
00:51:32,136 --> 00:51:34,242
- ...I got in trouble.
- No.

1023
00:51:34,409 --> 00:51:36,417
- Like I don't know you.
- No. You don't--?

1024
00:51:36,586 --> 00:51:39,784
- You're mad at me for something.
- I'm not. I'm...

1025
00:51:39,947 --> 00:51:41,355
You're not happy for me.

1026
00:51:41,516 --> 00:51:43,459
I'm happy for you
because you do good work...

1027
00:51:43,629 --> 00:51:45,801
...and you're wonderful
at what you do.

1028
00:51:45,966 --> 00:51:49,164
You know how embarrassing
that was for me in there?

1029
00:51:49,328 --> 00:51:52,428
- You weren't happy for me.
- Listen, Callie, I'm happy for you.

1030
00:51:52,593 --> 00:51:55,114
- What is your problem?
- I don't have a problem. I'll--

1031
00:51:55,282 --> 00:51:57,290
- You're jealous. That's your problem.
- No.

1032
00:51:57,459 --> 00:52:01,258
If you're not gonna be there for me
then I will do this alone.

1033
00:52:01,428 --> 00:52:03,534
- I'm confused.
- I don't need you.

1034
00:52:03,701 --> 00:52:07,052
I don't need anybody.
I don't need you.

1035
00:52:07,928 --> 00:52:09,969
And you know what, Brian?
You're not confused.

1036
00:52:10,136 --> 00:52:12,593
- Callie.
- I see right through you.

1037
00:52:12,762 --> 00:52:16,408
- Come back here, please.
- I see right through you.

1038
00:52:22,142 --> 00:52:23,801
If you take my meaning.

1039
00:52:23,966 --> 00:52:26,488
Oh, good times, good times.
Well, done.

1040
00:52:26,655 --> 00:52:29,853
- Well done, everybody.
- We're very, very relieved and happy.

1041
00:52:30,017 --> 00:52:32,440
I mean, we had no idea, you know,
what to expect.

1042
00:52:32,610 --> 00:52:34,880
- We've never been here before.
- Babes in the woods.

1043
00:52:35,043 --> 00:52:36,669
It's great. The cast are great.

1044
00:52:36,836 --> 00:52:39,837
We make enough money on this,
there'll be babes in the trailers.

1045
00:52:40,005 --> 00:52:42,014
Hey, hey. Hey, now.

1046
00:52:42,182 --> 00:52:46,494
And so with a few little tweaks
here and there, you know...

1047
00:52:46,697 --> 00:52:48,290
What kind of tweaks?

1048
00:52:48,457 --> 00:52:51,458
Just make it more palatable.
We want a wider audience to see it.

1049
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:53,285
We don't want a very small art movie.

1050
00:52:53,451 --> 00:52:55,274
Oh, I see what you're saying.
No, no, no.

1051
00:52:55,436 --> 00:52:58,088
I don't think you have that problem.
I've seen cut footage.

1052
00:52:58,253 --> 00:53:00,775
It's vital and it's exciting.
It's about real people.

1053
00:53:00,943 --> 00:53:02,766
Yeah, yeah, yeah. But we can--

1054
00:53:02,928 --> 00:53:06,475
It will be if we just tone
some of the themes down a little bit.

1055
00:53:06,705 --> 00:53:08,779
- That's all. Just tone--
- And how would that be?

1056
00:53:08,946 --> 00:53:10,703
- Just--
- What is the theme?

1057
00:53:10,867 --> 00:53:14,928
Well, the Jewishness.
Which is good. Ethnicity is good.

1058
00:53:15,093 --> 00:53:17,647
- Well, they are Jewish.
- Absolutely. Tone that down...

1059
00:53:17,814 --> 00:53:19,407
...and then everyone can enjoy it.

1060
00:53:19,574 --> 00:53:21,430
Wait. This is about a Jewish family.

1061
00:53:21,591 --> 00:53:23,414
They're home for Purim.
That's the title.

1062
00:53:23,576 --> 00:53:26,033
Well, we could--
Yeah, we could change the title.

1063
00:53:26,201 --> 00:53:28,952
I wasn't suggesting we change the title.
I'm pointing out...

1064
00:53:29,115 --> 00:53:32,859
...that Purim is an essential part
of this story.

1065
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:35,028
It looks like guys in suits
are telling you--

1066
00:53:35,197 --> 00:53:36,659
- No, no, no.
- It's not that.

1067
00:53:36,830 --> 00:53:40,061
Just tone down the Jewishness
so everyone can enjoy it.

1068
00:53:40,224 --> 00:53:41,948
- Title change would be good.
- No one...

1069
00:53:42,112 --> 00:53:44,928
...is wearing a hat or has ringlets.

1070
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:47,262
I'm just saying the film as a whole,
the theme...

1071
00:53:47,427 --> 00:53:48,988
...the whole thrust of the film...

1072
00:53:49,155 --> 00:53:52,124
...the whole in-your-face
Jewishness of the film...

1073
00:53:52,293 --> 00:53:54,268
...tone it down.
We could change the title.

1074
00:53:54,438 --> 00:53:56,349
Oh, here's people coming
to see it now.

1075
00:53:56,518 --> 00:53:59,781
It's a good film and there's people
watching. That'd be good, wouldn't it?

1076
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:03,558
What if we do a different holiday
around the table-- Easter.

1077
00:54:03,722 --> 00:54:05,129
--and just focus on the rabbit?

1078
00:54:05,291 --> 00:54:09,221
All I'm saying is have it there,
don't shove it down people's throats.

1079
00:54:09,389 --> 00:54:11,397
I don't-- I don't run around--

1080
00:54:11,566 --> 00:54:14,436
I don't run around going,
"I'm a Gentile, look at my foreskin."

1081
00:54:14,607 --> 00:54:17,096
I don't shove it down your throat,
because I don't care.

1082
00:54:17,552 --> 00:54:20,236
Three, two, one, and hit them.

1083
00:54:20,401 --> 00:54:21,612
We're sitting on the set...

1084
00:54:21,778 --> 00:54:24,911
...of one of the hottest movies
being made in Hollywood today.

1085
00:54:25,076 --> 00:54:26,800
It's called <i>Hello, Purim</i>.

1086
00:54:26,964 --> 00:54:28,274
- <i>Home for Purim.</i>
- No, <i>"Home."</i>

1087
00:54:28,437 --> 00:54:29,714
<i>Home for Purim.</i>

1088
00:54:29,878 --> 00:54:33,196
Some faces we're not familiar with.
Some new faces.

1089
00:54:33,366 --> 00:54:35,920
And I recognize Victor Allan Miller.

1090
00:54:36,088 --> 00:54:38,293
- How are you? Question for you.
- I'm fine, Chuck.

1091
00:54:38,489 --> 00:54:40,759
<i>The Brady Bunch.</i>
What was your favorite character?

1092
00:54:41,338 --> 00:54:43,728
- Jan.
- Well, she's an attractive young lady.

1093
00:54:44,155 --> 00:54:46,523
Mine was-- I think her name was Alice.
Was that it?

1094
00:54:46,685 --> 00:54:49,621
She was the maid. She was the glue
that held the family together.

1095
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:51,679
- You had a question, Cindy?
- Yes. Victor...

1096
00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:54,906
...when word got out
that I was interviewing you today...

1097
00:54:55,072 --> 00:54:57,528
...I was inundated
with phone calls and e-mails...

1098
00:54:57,697 --> 00:55:00,895
- ...all of them asking me to ask you...
- Knocked out by the opportunity.

1099
00:55:01,059 --> 00:55:02,915
- ...the same question.
- Which is?

1100
00:55:03,076 --> 00:55:05,149
Where the heck have you been?

1101
00:55:05,316 --> 00:55:08,165
Oh, aren't you nice?
Well, actually, I've been teaching in--

1102
00:55:08,358 --> 00:55:10,464
That's rhetorical.
You don't have to answer.

1103
00:55:10,631 --> 00:55:12,966
Marilyn Hack,
you play the matriarch here...

1104
00:55:13,128 --> 00:55:15,016
...and you are dying as I understand.

1105
00:55:15,433 --> 00:55:18,052
That must be tough,
doing a dramatic scene like this.

1106
00:55:18,474 --> 00:55:21,672
Let me ask a question.
Anybody play any gags...

1107
00:55:21,836 --> 00:55:23,593
...any pranks on the set?

1108
00:55:23,757 --> 00:55:25,962
Anything funny that happened?

1109
00:55:26,926 --> 00:55:29,545
No high jinks per se, but I--

1110
00:55:29,711 --> 00:55:33,357
Hold it just a second. I gotta take this.
Yeah?

1111
00:55:33,521 --> 00:55:34,895
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

1112
00:55:35,058 --> 00:55:37,328
- Nothing much.
- Yeah, talk amongst yourselves.

1113
00:55:37,491 --> 00:55:39,434
- No, it was easy day.
- Hang up the phone.

1114
00:55:39,603 --> 00:55:41,262
Aren't these things wonderful?

1115
00:55:41,428 --> 00:55:44,746
In a restaurant, you can use them.
You don't have to hunt for a pay phone.

1116
00:55:44,918 --> 00:55:47,570
They say soon we'll be able
to use them on an airplane.

1117
00:55:47,735 --> 00:55:50,354
Callie Webb,
you had to play the daughter...

1118
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:52,976
...that comes home to her mom
who is dying.

1119
00:55:53,145 --> 00:55:55,033
You have a history of standup comedy.

1120
00:55:55,195 --> 00:55:57,716
Were you able to fall back
on your comedy chops...

1121
00:55:57,883 --> 00:55:59,924
- ...in playing a role like that?
- No.

1122
00:56:00,093 --> 00:56:01,882
- It doesn't translate, eh?
- It's a drama.

1123
00:56:02,045 --> 00:56:05,308
Tragedy plus time equals comedy.
I didn't know if it worked the other way.

1124
00:56:05,470 --> 00:56:07,326
- It's a different movie.
- Yeah.

1125
00:56:07,487 --> 00:56:10,172
Years ago, I read a book called
<i>The Little Engine That Could.</i>

1126
00:56:10,337 --> 00:56:11,832
- "I think I can."
- What?

1127
00:56:12,001 --> 00:56:13,857
"I think I can, I think I can...

1128
00:56:14,018 --> 00:56:15,808
- ...I think I can.
- That's what he says.

1129
00:56:15,972 --> 00:56:18,144
- That's what the train said as--
- I think I can...

1130
00:56:18,308 --> 00:56:20,578
- I think it was just three.
- ...I think I can."

1131
00:56:20,741 --> 00:56:24,355
And it reminds me of this little movie
that started out as practically nothing...

1132
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:26,560
...and is chugging up, up, up.

1133
00:56:26,728 --> 00:56:29,380
Who knows if it's gonna
reach its goal and explode.

1134
00:56:29,545 --> 00:56:31,401
It's a wonderful book.

1135
00:56:31,562 --> 00:56:34,859
It's big print, lot of pictures,
not too heavy reading.

1136
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:38,633
If you want something heavy, see <i>Hamlet</i>
or Shakespeare or something like that.

1137
00:56:38,797 --> 00:56:41,002
For me, something you can
get into and out of.

1138
00:56:41,166 --> 00:56:43,785
God bless you all.
Victor, keep plugging at your career...

1139
00:56:43,951 --> 00:56:45,228
...despite what critics say.

1140
00:56:45,393 --> 00:56:47,849
You know, the dogs bark,
but the caravans move on.

1141
00:56:48,018 --> 00:56:51,761
Everyone, keep up the good work.
Tune into our show Friday night...

1142
00:57:10,522 --> 00:57:11,929
C.J. Simon...

1143
00:57:12,122 --> 00:57:14,578
...and a group of people
who stand around him...

1144
00:57:14,747 --> 00:57:17,716
...because there's no studio work.
Please get a name for your band.

1145
00:57:17,885 --> 00:57:21,563
Our next guest finished shooting
a charming little movie this past summer...

1146
00:57:21,726 --> 00:57:23,483
...that was just supposed to pay rent.

1147
00:57:23,647 --> 00:57:26,201
Here we are in January,
with the Oscars around the corner.

1148
00:57:26,368 --> 00:57:29,501
Let me tell you, that charming
little movie not only paid the rent...

1149
00:57:29,666 --> 00:57:31,739
...could end up buying her
the whole block.

1150
00:57:31,907 --> 00:57:33,369
It turned this town on its ear.

1151
00:57:33,539 --> 00:57:36,028
Please welcome the star
of <i>Home for Thanksgiving...</i>

1152
00:57:36,197 --> 00:57:39,232
...Marilyn Hack. Oh, Marilyn?

1153
00:57:46,474 --> 00:57:48,711
I love you, Marilyn!

1154
00:57:50,570 --> 00:57:53,638
- Well, good evening.
- Good evening, Ben.

1155
00:57:53,868 --> 00:57:56,106
Thank you very much
for being here with us.

1156
00:57:56,270 --> 00:57:58,409
Oh, no, thank you.
It's a dream come true.

1157
00:57:58,574 --> 00:58:02,733
Well, we're glad that we could
help you achieve your dream.

1158
00:58:02,897 --> 00:58:05,353
Speaking of which,
there is word on the street...

1159
00:58:05,522 --> 00:58:09,069
...that your performance in this movie
is spellbinding.

1160
00:58:09,235 --> 00:58:12,105
- Well...
- Tell me a little about the movie.

1161
00:58:12,276 --> 00:58:14,317
It's about Thanksgiving,
which I believe...

1162
00:58:14,485 --> 00:58:18,065
...is probably our most elegant holiday.
Don't you think so?

1163
00:58:19,063 --> 00:58:21,366
- I do now.
- Because we say "thank you."

1164
00:58:21,528 --> 00:58:23,668
And I, for one,
can't say thank you enough.

1165
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:27,796
And it's all-inclusive. It includes
everyone, no matter what religion.

1166
00:58:27,963 --> 00:58:30,201
- It's nondenominational.
- Exactly, that's the word.

1167
00:58:30,364 --> 00:58:33,300
And it kicks off Awards season.

1168
00:58:33,470 --> 00:58:36,221
I gotta tell you.
I see a lot of films. I love all of them.

1169
00:58:36,383 --> 00:58:39,035
And <i>Home for Thanksgiving?</i>
I think it's my favorite film.

1170
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:40,509
Favorite film of the year.

1171
00:58:40,897 --> 00:58:42,970
- Well--
- Oh, here we go.

1172
00:58:43,138 --> 00:58:44,546
--I hate to surprise you, Ben...

1173
00:58:45,218 --> 00:58:48,481
...but I also enjoyed it very, very much.

1174
00:58:49,637 --> 00:58:51,580
- You know, when people see--
- I slobbered.

1175
00:58:51,749 --> 00:58:53,638
I don't believe this.

1176
00:58:54,278 --> 00:58:56,352
- Well, thank goodness.
- <i>Home for Thanksgiving...</i>

1177
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:59,488
...is, as far as I'm concerned,
one of the top films of the year.

1178
00:58:59,657 --> 00:59:01,633
I mean, Oscars. I smell Oscars.

1179
00:59:01,802 --> 00:59:03,558
I loved it. I loved the movie.

1180
00:59:03,722 --> 00:59:06,244
KXBD 104.9 Talk Radio.

1181
00:59:06,412 --> 00:59:07,939
- Dinkie and Don--
- Turning you on.

1182
00:59:08,109 --> 00:59:11,144
It's the Morningwood Show.
Morningwood and Holly would if she could.

1183
00:59:11,310 --> 00:59:14,246
- I've got morning wood this morning.
- Yes, we do.

1184
00:59:14,416 --> 00:59:17,548
We got a special guest.
That's the reason for my wood, I tell you.

1185
00:59:17,713 --> 00:59:19,437
- Her name is Callie Webb.
- How are you?

1186
00:59:19,601 --> 00:59:21,904
- I'm good. How are you?
- Excited to have you here.

1187
00:59:22,066 --> 00:59:25,363
We heard there's a little bit of,
I don't know, Awards-season buzz...

1188
00:59:25,524 --> 00:59:27,860
- ...around the film you have opening.
- That's right.

1189
00:59:28,022 --> 00:59:29,778
- Tell us about that.
- I'm very excited.

1190
00:59:29,942 --> 00:59:31,885
The film is called <i>Home for Thanksgiving</i>.

1191
00:59:32,055 --> 00:59:34,161
- And--
- How many topless scenes do you have?

1192
00:59:34,328 --> 00:59:36,304
- There are no topless scenes.
- No scenes?

1193
00:59:36,473 --> 00:59:38,164
- What's the point?
- How is there buzz?

1194
00:59:38,330 --> 00:59:39,508
But there's...

1195
00:59:42,524 --> 00:59:43,735
Gentlemen, welcome.

1196
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:45,307
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

1197
00:59:45,468 --> 00:59:47,444
So here you are, playwrights.

1198
00:59:47,870 --> 00:59:51,865
How has the transition been from writing
for the stage to writing for screen?

1199
00:59:52,512 --> 00:59:55,196
Because it starts out
as a wordsmith's medium.

1200
00:59:55,361 --> 00:59:58,625
It starts out as a medium
in which your script is sacrosanct.

1201
00:59:59,043 --> 01:00:01,891
- Yes.
- Correct? And it's a medium...

1202
01:00:02,052 --> 01:00:05,217
...in the screen,
where the director calls the shots.

1203
01:00:05,381 --> 01:00:09,507
The director designs what's gonna go on,
the sequence of events.

1204
01:00:09,831 --> 01:00:13,727
The director, in fact,
can marshal your words around...

1205
01:00:13,897 --> 01:00:16,265
...and you're relegated.
Do you feel relegated...

1206
01:00:16,874 --> 01:00:18,915
...in this situation?
Or do you feel like...

1207
01:00:19,083 --> 01:00:21,702
...you have reached a position of comfort?

1208
01:00:24,942 --> 01:00:27,245
What up, everybody?
It's your boy, chillaxing.

1209
01:00:27,407 --> 01:00:29,034
We have a special guest today.

1210
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:32,550
He's the star of the upcoming new movie,
<i>Home for Thanksgiving...</i>

1211
01:00:32,722 --> 01:00:34,097
...which comes out this Friday.

1212
01:00:34,258 --> 01:00:36,266
I want you guys
to give a warm welcome...

1213
01:00:36,435 --> 01:00:39,251
...for Victor Allan Miller.

1214
01:00:39,412 --> 01:00:42,130
- Yeah!
- Yes!

1215
01:00:45,207 --> 01:00:47,248
- What's up, man? How you doing?
- How you doing?

1216
01:00:47,416 --> 01:00:50,614
- I'm so glad you could be here.
- I am so thrilled. I'm pumped, stoked.

1217
01:00:50,777 --> 01:00:53,625
Absolutely, absolutely.
Here on <i>Chillaxin'</i>.

1218
01:00:53,787 --> 01:00:56,057
- We're gonna pump this beat now.
- So am I dancing?

1219
01:00:56,220 --> 01:01:00,084
Yeah, exactly.
All right, cool. Right there.

1220
01:01:01,245 --> 01:01:03,188
Let go a little bit.
That's what we gonna do.

1221
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:06,143
That's what I'm talking about, chillaxing.
Let go even more.

1222
01:01:06,304 --> 01:01:07,799
- Let go even more. More.
- More?

1223
01:01:07,968 --> 01:01:09,791
- Absolutely.
- I'm a sandwich, huh?

1224
01:01:09,954 --> 01:01:12,704
- Just have a good time. That's what it is.
- All right, Victor!

1225
01:01:14,276 --> 01:01:16,349
- Yeah, right there.
- <i>Home for Thanksgiving.</i>

1226
01:01:16,516 --> 01:01:19,779
Some love for him right now.
Victor, right now, letting go.

1227
01:01:22,695 --> 01:01:26,275
Well, the countdown
to Awards season has begun.

1228
01:01:26,441 --> 01:01:29,093
The nominations will be announced
in just two days.

1229
01:01:29,258 --> 01:01:32,521
And once again, we have to rely on
Chuck and Cindy's crystal ball...

1230
01:01:32,683 --> 01:01:35,466
...to give us the inside track
on this year's favorites.

1231
01:01:35,629 --> 01:01:38,532
Yes. We will gaze into the crystal ball...

1232
01:01:38,702 --> 01:01:42,151
...and tell you who we see
as our nomination picks.

1233
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,623
Nice accent, incidentally.

1234
01:01:44,785 --> 01:01:47,568
Cindy, who do you see for Best Actor?

1235
01:01:47,762 --> 01:01:50,381
Well, I see two faces appearing, Chuck.

1236
01:01:50,547 --> 01:01:53,199
Ben Connelly
for <i>Whispers in the Attic...</i>

1237
01:01:53,364 --> 01:01:57,228
...and Victor Allan Miller
for <i>Home for Thanksgiving.</i>

1238
01:01:57,654 --> 01:01:59,727
Who do you see
for Best Actress, Chuck?

1239
01:01:59,895 --> 01:02:04,502
I see Louise Mayer for the classy,
big-budget musical, <i>Dream Alley</i>.

1240
01:02:04,666 --> 01:02:07,798
And there seems to be two other faces
fighting for recognition.

1241
01:02:07,962 --> 01:02:11,128
Marilyn Hack and Callie Webb.

1242
01:02:11,293 --> 01:02:13,049
Both for <i>Home for Thanksgiving</i>.

1243
01:02:13,213 --> 01:02:14,643
Yeah, well, I'll tell you what.

1244
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:18,012
Tomorrow night, the Best Supporting
Actor and Actress category.

1245
01:02:18,175 --> 01:02:22,268
- But right now...
- I see a commercial in the future.

1246
01:02:22,433 --> 01:02:25,020
And I'm feeling a lot better
about my accent.

1247
01:02:32,741 --> 01:02:34,204
Guess who. Hi.

1248
01:02:35,047 --> 01:02:36,477
Hi.

1249
01:02:37,224 --> 01:02:38,501
Hi, darling.

1250
01:02:39,112 --> 01:02:41,535
Do you believe this?
Do you believe any of it?

1251
01:02:41,993 --> 01:02:44,133
It's too exciting. How do you feel?

1252
01:02:44,299 --> 01:02:45,674
- I feel good.
- Oh, yes.

1253
01:02:45,835 --> 01:02:49,382
I don't see anything wrong with both of us
being nominated. Don't see why not.

1254
01:02:49,549 --> 01:02:51,754
I'm sure it's been done before,
don't you think?

1255
01:02:51,950 --> 01:02:54,668
I mean, after tomorrow,
I won't talk to you, but...

1256
01:02:55,824 --> 01:02:58,061
- Marilyn?
- Yes, it's exciting.

1257
01:02:58,225 --> 01:02:59,818
It's exciting, isn't it?

1258
01:02:59,985 --> 01:03:01,262
Yeah.

1259
01:03:01,426 --> 01:03:03,085
I'm so-- I'm very happy for you.

1260
01:03:03,251 --> 01:03:05,194
I'm happy for you too, Marilyn.

1261
01:03:05,364 --> 01:03:08,235
I haven't seen Brian here,
my other little baby.

1262
01:03:09,429 --> 01:03:11,285
- We split up.
- You did not.

1263
01:03:11,447 --> 01:03:12,822
- Yeah.
- Tell me you're kidding.

1264
01:03:12,983 --> 01:03:15,351
- Yeah, it's--
- That's awful.

1265
01:03:16,216 --> 01:03:17,908
Hello, blondie.

1266
01:03:18,649 --> 01:03:20,505
Are you a natural blond?

1267
01:03:20,762 --> 01:03:24,025
Oh, no. All of it
is really brown and curly.

1268
01:03:27,101 --> 01:03:30,681
Mixing business with pleasure.
My pleasure.

1269
01:03:31,903 --> 01:03:33,082
Yeah.

1270
01:03:33,248 --> 01:03:36,348
Do you like restaurants? You like wine.
Do you like restaurants?

1271
01:03:37,922 --> 01:03:39,352
- They're okay.
- Yeah.

1272
01:03:39,779 --> 01:03:41,274
Do you wanna go to a restaurant?

1273
01:03:42,083 --> 01:03:43,360
Maybe.

1274
01:03:44,004 --> 01:03:45,761
What sort do you like?

1275
01:03:45,925 --> 01:03:47,387
I like...

1276
01:03:48,551 --> 01:03:51,716
..."latesion"? Lesion?

1277
01:03:52,424 --> 01:03:55,273
Lesion, that's a-- That's like a wound.

1278
01:03:55,433 --> 01:03:58,468
No, it's Latin restaurants...

1279
01:03:58,635 --> 01:04:01,058
- ...but I don't know what the word is.
- Latin?

1280
01:04:01,228 --> 01:04:03,848
Latin restaurants.
You mean, like, Mexican or...?

1281
01:04:04,014 --> 01:04:07,277
No, Latin. The people that speak Latin.

1282
01:04:07,951 --> 01:04:09,512
I need this to calm my nerves.

1283
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:11,786
- I'm not gonna sleep tonight.
- It's so exciting.

1284
01:04:11,953 --> 01:04:15,021
I'm a peeled nerve. I'm just--
I'm all jitters. I can hardly...

1285
01:04:15,187 --> 01:04:18,254
I think Marilyn is very deserving,
but I think Callie is equally...

1286
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:19,827
...as deserving of an award.

1287
01:04:19,989 --> 01:04:22,029
She's wonderful,
but it's an early celebration.

1288
01:04:22,197 --> 01:04:24,020
I don't think she's quite ripened yet.

1289
01:04:24,182 --> 01:04:27,894
But you know what? I have to tell you
that when I was a very little girl...

1290
01:04:28,056 --> 01:04:30,195
...my daddy would say to me,
he said, you know:

1291
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:32,500
"Never let them see you sweat."

1292
01:04:32,666 --> 01:04:36,377
And I think that the voters
can smell the fear. It's like dogs.

1293
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:38,166
They know that she's hungry.

1294
01:04:38,332 --> 01:04:41,400
No, but you know what? I'm sorry.
Dying is easy.

1295
01:04:41,566 --> 01:04:43,127
Playing a lesbian is hard.

1296
01:04:43,295 --> 01:04:46,777
Oh, please. Marilyn Hack is the queen
and tomorrow, there will be a coronation.

1297
01:04:46,944 --> 01:04:48,799
There was a thousand queens
on that set.

1298
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:50,521
- And you know that.
- Your point is?

1299
01:04:50,689 --> 01:04:52,381
Oh, come on. There's a ton of queens.

1300
01:04:53,091 --> 01:04:56,027
It's been a good experience
for everybody. I mean, you know...

1301
01:04:56,196 --> 01:04:59,580
...this is the last bargain-basement deal
you get out of this guy.

1302
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:01,725
You know?
We now have to be more discerning.

1303
01:05:01,895 --> 01:05:04,711
We're not gonna just take
any commercial that comes our way.

1304
01:05:04,872 --> 01:05:07,240
- We're not gonna take any.
- We're not gonna take any.

1305
01:05:07,401 --> 01:05:10,053
Gentlemen, <i>c'est ça</i>.
Now, if I may go out on a--

1306
01:05:10,218 --> 01:05:11,910
- Jesus, don't touch me.
- Sorry.

1307
01:05:12,075 --> 01:05:14,629
Corey, what is it, Pioneer Days
at Moorpark this weekend?

1308
01:05:14,796 --> 01:05:17,797
Certified degree of Indian blood.
It's on my wall, <i>kemo</i>.

1309
01:05:17,966 --> 01:05:21,098
Mr. Miller, I presume you will be
watching the nominations...

1310
01:05:21,262 --> 01:05:23,500
...this morning at 5 a.m.
on your television set.

1311
01:05:23,664 --> 01:05:26,699
Well, I would, except for the fact
that I don't own a television.

1312
01:05:26,866 --> 01:05:29,649
- Has no TV. Yeah.
- I'd be happy to telephone you.

1313
01:05:29,810 --> 01:05:32,015
Call me, Taft, and I will call him. Okay?

1314
01:05:32,179 --> 01:05:33,641
- We're having a meeting.
- Got you.

1315
01:05:33,812 --> 01:05:35,952
Could you step back, physically?

1316
01:05:36,118 --> 01:05:39,348
- Yep. I'm going to go sit in my car.
- Thank you.

1317
01:05:40,087 --> 01:05:41,648
Hello.

1318
01:05:42,264 --> 01:05:43,508
Hello, everybody.

1319
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:45,423
Come around.

1320
01:05:46,874 --> 01:05:49,526
Come on. Okay.

1321
01:05:50,108 --> 01:05:51,450
Okay:

1322
01:05:54,366 --> 01:05:56,788
Okay. Thanks.

1323
01:05:58,271 --> 01:06:02,102
When the enchanting Whitney Brown
first came into my office...

1324
01:06:03,297 --> 01:06:06,943
...I realized I was in
for a very special encounter.

1325
01:06:07,106 --> 01:06:10,752
And when I actually got around
to reading the coverage...

1326
01:06:10,916 --> 01:06:14,846
...I realized I had in my mitts a story...

1327
01:06:15,014 --> 01:06:17,830
...the likes of which
I had not seen before.

1328
01:06:18,279 --> 01:06:20,003
Which goes to show...

1329
01:06:20,168 --> 01:06:23,399
...the suits aren't always the wankers
they're made out to be.

1330
01:06:23,562 --> 01:06:25,188
Hear, hear.

1331
01:06:26,443 --> 01:06:28,713
So with that in mind...

1332
01:06:28,876 --> 01:06:31,212
...I would like to propose a toast...

1333
01:06:31,373 --> 01:06:35,565
...to the future nominees
for <i>Home for Thanksgiving.</i>

1334
01:06:35,983 --> 01:06:37,773
The future nominees.

1335
01:06:37,937 --> 01:06:39,399
<i>Home for Thanksgiving.</i>

1336
01:06:39,569 --> 01:06:42,570
<i>Home for Thanksgiving.</i>

1337
01:06:51,606 --> 01:06:55,055
<i>The backup, however,</i>
<i>remains northbound at Costa Mesa.</i>

1338
01:06:55,224 --> 01:06:59,666
<i>In Hollywood, traffic on the 101</i>
<i>is running smoothly in both directions...</i>

1339
01:06:59,833 --> 01:07:02,682
<i>...through the Cahuenga Pass</i>
<i>and into downtown L.A.</i>

1340
01:07:02,843 --> 01:07:05,015
<i>That is your early drive-time report...</i>

1341
01:07:05,180 --> 01:07:07,832
<i>...and now we head back</i>
<i>to our KAJE coverage...</i>

1342
01:07:07,997 --> 01:07:10,901
<i>...of the nominations from the Academy.</i>

1343
01:07:11,071 --> 01:07:15,775
<i>And now the nominations</i>
<i>for Best Actress in a Motion Picture.</i>

1344
01:07:17,441 --> 01:07:21,305
<i>Veronica Randolph</i>

<i>Cynthia Chapman</i>
<i>in</i> Pride of Plymouth Rock<i>.</i>

1346
01:07:27,077 --> 01:07:28,736
- Okay, say it.
- <i>Sally Ann Middleton...</i>

1347
01:07:28,902 --> 01:07:31,587
- ...<i>in</i> Whispers in the Attic<i>.</i>
- Say it now.

1348
01:07:32,584 --> 01:07:35,684
<i>Louise Mayer in</i> Dream Alley<i>.</i>

1349
01:07:38,187 --> 01:07:41,833
<i>And Monique LeBlanc</i>
<i>in</i> Le Cheval Obscurité<i>.</i>

1350
01:07:42,860 --> 01:07:44,716
Dark Horse.

1351
01:07:45,646 --> 01:07:49,771
<i>The nominations for Best Actor</i>
<i>in a Motion Picture are...</i>

1352
01:07:50,608 --> 01:07:54,832
...<i>Ben Connelly in</i> Whispers in the Attic<i>.</i>

1353
01:07:55,826 --> 01:07:57,037
Marilyn Hack.

1354
01:07:57,202 --> 01:07:59,407
- <i>Jose Mercado in</i> Crystal Lake<i>.</i>
- Just...

1355
01:07:59,572 --> 01:08:02,705
Just say Marilyn Hack.

1356
01:08:02,869 --> 01:08:04,877
- <i>William Montague...</i>
- It's so easy.

1357
01:08:05,046 --> 01:08:07,316
...<i>in</i> Tomorrow Never Sleeps<i>.</i>

1358
01:08:33,891 --> 01:08:36,576
<i>Hi, this is Brian,</i>
<i>please leave me a message.</i>

1359
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:40,287
<i>Brian? Brian, it's Corey.</i>
<i>Corey Taft and Associates.</i>

1360
01:08:40,454 --> 01:08:42,910
<i>Congratulations, my young friend.</i>

1361
01:08:43,079 --> 01:08:45,665
<i>You have achieved a nomination.</i>

1362
01:08:45,831 --> 01:08:49,663
<i>That is very exciting news</i>
<i>for a young actor...</i>

1363
01:08:50,858 --> 01:08:54,886
Good evening America, and anyone else
who can understand the king's English.

1364
01:08:55,052 --> 01:08:58,468
Well, the nominations are in
and there are surprises galore.

1365
01:08:58,637 --> 01:09:02,184
Well, I'll tell you what, Chuck.
Once again, the voters have spoken.

1366
01:09:02,351 --> 01:09:06,444
And it seems that sentiment alone
will not get you that coveted golden statue.

1367
01:09:06,608 --> 01:09:09,872
And because there were so many surprises,
Cindy, I thought to myself...

1368
01:09:10,035 --> 01:09:13,036
...instead of hearing the usual drivel
from the glowing nominees...

1369
01:09:13,204 --> 01:09:14,993
...what could be more
fun than hearing...

1370
01:09:15,156 --> 01:09:19,763
...what the devastatingly disappointed
losers had to say this morning?

1371
01:09:19,927 --> 01:09:23,311
Well, I guess it all depends on what
your definition of fun is, Chuck.

1372
01:09:23,481 --> 01:09:24,910
Fun is where you find it.

1373
01:09:25,081 --> 01:09:28,498
We had our roving cameras on the losers
first thing this morning...

1374
01:09:28,666 --> 01:09:31,188
...and here's what they had to say.

1375
01:09:33,533 --> 01:09:35,476
Hi, Callie. Chuck Porter...

1376
01:09:35,869 --> 01:09:39,351
<i>...Hollywood Now.</i> Scrunch over. I thought
you'd like some company this morning.

1377
01:09:39,519 --> 01:09:43,001
So let me start by saying... no nomination.

1378
01:09:43,169 --> 01:09:46,269
And I say that on behalf of myself
and all your fans.

1379
01:09:46,434 --> 01:09:48,802
Your movie was exceptional.

1380
01:09:48,963 --> 01:09:52,827
But what went wrong?
Why no nomination?

1381
01:09:53,765 --> 01:09:56,636
Honestly, Chuck,
I haven't really thought about it.

1382
01:09:56,806 --> 01:09:58,815
- No thought?
- It doesn't really matter.

1383
01:09:58,983 --> 01:10:01,767
It doesn't matter. Can I have an order
of humble pie over here?

1384
01:10:01,929 --> 01:10:05,705
For Miss Callie Webb? Don't say, "Who?"

1385
01:10:06,219 --> 01:10:08,740
One thing you have to look forward to
is having privacy.

1386
01:10:08,908 --> 01:10:11,724
Not having people come out and say,
"Can I have your autograph?"

1387
01:10:11,885 --> 01:10:13,675
No autographs for this lady.

1388
01:10:13,838 --> 01:10:16,359
What do you mean
you didn't want one anyway?

1389
01:10:16,975 --> 01:10:20,839
Victor Allan Miller is inside auditioning
for a Buffalo-wings commercial.

1390
01:10:21,009 --> 01:10:23,530
Let's sneak inside like a fly on the wall.

1391
01:10:23,698 --> 01:10:25,968
Maybe they won't even notice
we're there.

1392
01:10:26,131 --> 01:10:28,751
Wow, that's spicy.

1393
01:10:29,045 --> 01:10:31,119
- Wow, that's spicy.
- You've sold me.

1394
01:10:31,285 --> 01:10:33,196
I'll take a thousand
of those Buffalo wings.

1395
01:10:33,367 --> 01:10:36,018
Because I got 500 buffalo
I'm teaching how to fly.

1396
01:10:36,183 --> 01:10:38,672
Chuck Porter, <i>Hollywood Now</i>.
Would you all be an angel...

1397
01:10:38,841 --> 01:10:41,046
...and give us two minutes
with Mr. Miller, here.

1398
01:10:41,210 --> 01:10:42,804
- Hello, Chuck.
- How are you, Victor?

1399
01:10:42,971 --> 01:10:44,946
- I'm good, I'm good.
- Victor, listen.

1400
01:10:45,116 --> 01:10:48,281
You're striking
while the iron is cold, right?

1401
01:10:48,958 --> 01:10:51,414
I was shocked that you were
considered for a nomination.

1402
01:10:51,583 --> 01:10:54,072
But once the word came out,
I was rooting for you.

1403
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:57,110
How did it feel when you thought
you were gonna get a nomination?

1404
01:10:57,281 --> 01:11:00,960
You know, when you just came in, I thought
you were gonna say there was a mistake.

1405
01:11:01,123 --> 01:11:03,775
I wish I could have.
There were so many great performances.

1406
01:11:03,940 --> 01:11:06,396
You know, I'm gonna call you Mr. Miller.

1407
01:11:06,565 --> 01:11:09,086
Because it's kind of hypocritical
to call you Victor.

1408
01:11:09,254 --> 01:11:11,197
- You get what I'm saying?
- I get it, yeah.

1409
01:11:11,367 --> 01:11:13,058
Victor, he's certainly not a victor.

1410
01:11:13,224 --> 01:11:15,397
Can I help you?
Are you a member of the union?

1411
01:11:15,561 --> 01:11:18,311
Would you tell your cameraman
I have to sign a release?

1412
01:11:18,474 --> 01:11:20,679
I'm kidding. Just get back there
and make notes.

1413
01:11:20,843 --> 01:11:24,936
We are out of here. We're in Times Square.
And we've watched this man's ball drop...

1414
01:11:25,101 --> 01:11:29,926
...ignominiously, so let's light the sparklers
and move on down the road.

1415
01:11:30,223 --> 01:11:33,006
I think we see Marilyn Hack right now.
Let's pay her a visit.

1416
01:11:33,169 --> 01:11:36,716
Morning, Marilyn. Chuck Porter,
from <i>Hollywood Now</i>.

1417
01:11:36,882 --> 01:11:39,054
- Wrong house.
- No, the right house.

1418
01:11:39,219 --> 01:11:41,456
- I didn't get nominated.
- We wanna talk to Marilyn.

1419
01:11:41,620 --> 01:11:44,851
- Marilyn and trash. What a juxtaposition.
- I didn't get nominated.

1420
01:11:45,014 --> 01:11:46,444
We know that. And what happened?

1421
01:11:46,614 --> 01:11:48,241
- What was that?
- But the important--

1422
01:11:48,407 --> 01:11:50,000
You get close to being nominated.

1423
01:11:50,168 --> 01:11:53,399
- That's what it's all about.
- No, it's not right. It's a big tease.

1424
01:11:53,562 --> 01:11:57,426
Because four out of five of those girls
are gonna lose, bigtime.

1425
01:11:57,595 --> 01:11:59,287
- Can I ask you--?
- Way worse than me.

1426
01:11:59,452 --> 01:12:00,696
I didn't even get nominated.

1427
01:12:00,860 --> 01:12:03,829
- I'm not gonna lose. I'm not gonna lose.
- What happened? All right.

1428
01:12:03,998 --> 01:12:06,071
How could I think I'd win
if I'm not nominated?

1429
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:08,629
- That's what I mean. You came this close--
- Stop it!

1430
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:10,972
- I don't think you--
- I'm gonna go to France.

1431
01:12:11,137 --> 01:12:13,113
- What for?
- How'd the French girl get in?

1432
01:12:13,282 --> 01:12:16,130
The French movie. Drives me nuts,
with the writing on the screen.

1433
01:12:16,291 --> 01:12:20,155
- That's French. It's French. It's not legal.
- I don't think it's late-breaking news.

1434
01:12:20,325 --> 01:12:23,774
Then I'm gonna come back,
and they're gonna say, "Oh, la, la, French."

1435
01:12:23,942 --> 01:12:27,522
"French, foreign. You're so--
Let's give you all the awards."

1436
01:12:27,688 --> 01:12:29,314
And I'll say, "Fuck you.

1437
01:12:29,481 --> 01:12:31,849
You didn't know-- Even know it was me."

1438
01:12:32,010 --> 01:12:35,110
- No. I'm sure--
- Yeah, go see Frenchie.

1439
01:12:35,275 --> 01:12:37,611
No, I think they did a wonderful job.
Best of luck.

1440
01:12:37,773 --> 01:12:39,464
Come in. I got so much food. Come on.

1441
01:12:39,629 --> 01:12:42,445
Marilyn Hack. Now I know
what it feels like...

1442
01:12:42,606 --> 01:12:44,942
...to stare down into the Grand Canyon.

1443
01:12:45,104 --> 01:12:49,743
Chuck Porter, <i>Hollywood Now</i>,
saying, fade out.

1444
01:12:57,269 --> 01:13:01,165
<i>You were never there for me</i>
<i>You never really cared</i>

1445
01:13:01,335 --> 01:13:03,922
<i>I can see right through you</i>

1446
01:13:04,088 --> 01:13:08,213
<i>You were always running scared</i>

1447
01:13:09,435 --> 01:13:13,331
But wait. Were you there for him?

1448
01:13:13,948 --> 01:13:17,179
Did you give him everything he needed?

1449
01:13:18,494 --> 01:13:21,911
Maybe it was you
who was running scared.

1450
01:13:29,187 --> 01:13:31,610
<i>Wait a minute, wait a minute</i>

1451
01:13:31,780 --> 01:13:34,498
<i>You're changing the subject</i>

1452
01:13:34,661 --> 01:13:37,761
<i>I'm getting all confused</i>

1453
01:13:37,927 --> 01:13:40,928
<i>He always was the problem</i>

1454
01:13:41,096 --> 01:13:44,742
<i>I was being used</i>

1455
01:13:46,859 --> 01:13:48,550
Or was I?

1456
01:13:50,669 --> 01:13:55,941
<i>Second chances don't happen every day</i>

1457
01:13:56,111 --> 01:13:58,665
<i>But in every single way</i>

1458
01:13:58,832 --> 01:14:01,899
<i>I will forgive him</i>

1459
01:14:07,827 --> 01:14:10,098
Maybe I will forgive him...

1460
01:14:12,277 --> 01:14:14,351
...in hell!

1461
01:14:28,573 --> 01:14:30,199
What if I told you...

1462
01:14:30,365 --> 01:14:33,366
...that you could have a slim,
trim and sexy body...

1463
01:14:33,535 --> 01:14:35,391
...in just nine and a half days...

1464
01:14:35,552 --> 01:14:38,073
...and have all the fun
of a Hawaiian vacation?

1465
01:14:38,241 --> 01:14:39,584
Sound too good to be true?

1466
01:14:39,746 --> 01:14:42,944
Well, not when you're exercising
with Hula Balls.

1467
01:14:43,107 --> 01:14:46,142
And here to help demonstrate
this fantastic new product...

1468
01:14:46,308 --> 01:14:49,692
...a man who came this close
to getting nominated for an Oscar:

1469
01:14:49,862 --> 01:14:51,456
Victor Allan Miller.

1470
01:14:52,103 --> 01:14:53,281
Victor, welcome.

1471
01:14:53,448 --> 01:14:56,548
And congratulations on almost
being nominated. That's exciting.

1472
01:14:56,713 --> 01:14:58,120
Yes, it is. Thank you very much.

1473
01:14:58,282 --> 01:15:00,224
It was an honor
just to be almost nominated.

1474
01:15:00,394 --> 01:15:02,948
It's an honor to be demonstrating
this fantastic product.

1475
01:15:03,116 --> 01:15:05,506
Let me just show you
how easy it is to use.

1476
01:15:05,677 --> 01:15:08,199
Great. Now, to the untrained eye...

1477
01:15:08,366 --> 01:15:11,434
...it may look like Victor is having
the time of his life...

1478
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:13,837
...but he's actually working
his abdominals...

1479
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,936
...quads, calf and hip muscles.
Victor, may I join you?

1480
01:15:17,106 --> 01:15:18,351
- Please, do.
- Okay.

1481
01:15:18,515 --> 01:15:19,944
Plenty for everybody.

1482
01:15:20,115 --> 01:15:22,866
- God, this is as fun as it looks.
- Feels good, doesn't it?

1483
01:15:23,029 --> 01:15:24,818
- I'm feeling that burn.
- He looks good.

1484
01:15:24,981 --> 01:15:27,633
Good? He's this close from the A-list.

1485
01:15:27,798 --> 01:15:30,669
I mean, this is such a profile booster
for Victor.

1486
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:33,426
Because you gotta be somebody
to sell these balls.

1487
01:15:33,593 --> 01:15:35,056
They don't just ask anybody.

1488
01:15:35,225 --> 01:15:37,528
More people will see this
than all the Shakespeare...

1489
01:15:37,691 --> 01:15:39,547
...and all the Broadway he's ever done.

1490
01:15:39,708 --> 01:15:41,814
He's gonna get a lot of work from this.

1491
01:15:41,981 --> 01:15:44,884
- I'm gonna need some help to get up.
- I'm right here.

1492
01:15:45,471 --> 01:15:49,334
You can't get away from us, Pres.
We're both in your blood.

1493
01:15:50,177 --> 01:15:54,619
This is the country you were born to,
the country you know and trust.

1494
01:15:55,779 --> 01:15:59,872
Amy wouldn't understand.
She'd think there'd be snakes.

1495
01:16:00,036 --> 01:16:01,892
Julia, please.

1496
01:16:03,046 --> 01:16:04,956
- That was good.
- Thank you.

1497
01:16:10,441 --> 01:16:12,417
- Not bad. Not bad.
- Thank you.

1498
01:16:12,586 --> 01:16:13,863
- But indulge me.
- Okay.

1499
01:16:14,027 --> 01:16:15,554
Okay.

1500
01:16:19,053 --> 01:16:20,744
Like I am.

1501
01:16:20,910 --> 01:16:23,846
You can't get away from us, Pres.
We're both in your blood.

1502
01:16:24,015 --> 01:16:28,173
This is the country you were born to,
the country you know and trust.

1503
01:16:28,337 --> 01:16:30,029
Your country, Pres.

1504
01:16:31,378 --> 01:16:34,576
Amy wouldn't understand.
She'd just think there was snakes.

1505
01:16:34,740 --> 01:16:36,529
Julia, please.

1506
01:16:37,909 --> 01:16:39,764
See the difference?

1507
01:16:42,711 --> 01:16:43,988
Was it louder?

1508
01:16:45,817 --> 01:16:48,207
Oh, my darlings, you are so talented.

1509
01:16:48,377 --> 01:16:50,069
That's why you're here, with me.

1510
01:16:50,586 --> 01:16:54,516
But you are so full of yourselves.

1511
01:16:54,973 --> 01:17:00,125
Ask yourself why the naked mole-rat mother
allows 30 babies at once...

1512
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:03,550
...to grow inside her,
feed on her every resource...

1513
01:17:03,712 --> 01:17:06,878
...and stretch her skin
to the point of breaking.

1514
01:17:07,842 --> 01:17:11,673
I'll let you in on a little secret.
Because it feels good.

1515
01:17:12,644 --> 01:17:14,238
She lets it all go. Everything.

1516
01:17:14,405 --> 01:17:17,668
And she's left feeling comfortable
in her own skin.

1517
01:17:17,830 --> 01:17:20,253
Oh, I wish I could jump-cut you babies...

1518
01:17:20,423 --> 01:17:23,491
...right now to the happy place
that I'm in.

1519
01:17:23,657 --> 01:17:26,178
I wish, but that's your own journey.

1520
01:17:26,346 --> 01:17:28,135
It's worth it.

1521
01:17:28,299 --> 01:17:30,187
I have learned...

1522
01:17:30,572 --> 01:17:34,315
...that if I can expunge everything within...

1523
01:17:34,573 --> 01:17:37,575
...I am left comfortable...

1524
01:17:37,743 --> 01:17:40,200
...in my own skin.
