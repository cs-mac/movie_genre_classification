00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,706
See?
-Me too

17
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,587
See?

18
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:40,971
You're no good

19
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:52,274
What's the matter?

20
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,276
Come on

21
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,035
Come on

22
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,351
Mrs. Okubo

23
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:35,275
Thankyou

24
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,278
Nice spinach

25
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:42,324
It's so expensive.
20 yen

26
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,035
Can't even eat spinach now

27
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,955
No. Listen

28
00:04:52,125 --> 00:05:00,008
I heard a funny thing.
Our dues weren't paid

29
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,761
But we paid

30
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:08,684
Yes. Our women's
Assn Chairman said

31
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:11,478
we haven't paid our dues

32
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,773
But I paid

33
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:20,237
So did l.
-Then it's strange

34
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:22,364
It's strange

35
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:26,577
It couldn't be...?
-What?

36
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:31,790
She bought a washing machine

37
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:36,378
Yes, but on installments

38
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:41,091
But isn't it strange
about our dues?

39
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:44,052
Mrs. Okubo

40
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:48,599
She's here.
-Yes

41
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,560
Women's bulletin board!

42
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:53,353
Back?

43
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:58,358
You're early?

44
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:01,570
What is it?

45
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,656
I'm home

46
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:30,098
Where are you going?
Not next door!

47
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:33,810
No, I'm going to study

48
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:41,735
He's crazy about television

49
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:46,198
-Sumo wrestling season?
-Yes

50
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:50,160
Listen

51
00:06:50,536 --> 00:06:55,999
What happened the other day?

52
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,002
It's very strange

53
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:00,671
Why?

54
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:21,567
I'll go over first

55
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:31,410
Please, Mother,
get me another pair of pants!

56
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:37,583
What's the matter? Loose tummy?

57
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,127
Why do you soil your pants?
It's every day

58
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:43,255
I didn't buy a washer
foryour pants!

59
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:55,225
Mother, please give me
a clean pair of pants

60
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:59,521
Watching wrestling's all right

61
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:05,068
But they never learn
anything good over there

62
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:11,533
Figures.
We don't associate with them,

63
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:17,331
but that couple is in pyjamas
all day long

64
00:08:17,873 --> 00:08:21,668
She used to work in a cabaret, so...

65
00:08:22,044 --> 00:08:27,299
Well...she's that kind?

66
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:33,764
Excuse me.
-How much is the sauce?

67
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:37,768
Never mind.
I owe you money too. Later

68
00:08:38,936 --> 00:08:40,437
Then...

69
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:15,097
Hello

70
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:18,684
Come in. Come on

71
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:26,066
Minoru isn't here?

72
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:27,526
No

73
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,210
Wakanohana's good today

74
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:49,464
Any idea who'll win?

75
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:53,385
That's easy. Isn't it?

76
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:57,848
Sure. He's got a great overthrow.

77
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,770
Eat some

78
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,986
Time to go

79
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:25,417
Isn't your next door friend coming?

80
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,129
Shall we call him?

81
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:42,309
-Minoru!
-Minoru!

82
00:10:48,524 --> 00:10:50,150
Come on

83
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,528
What's the matter? Hurry!

84
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:20,013
-I'm going!
-I'm going!

85
00:11:21,557 --> 00:11:22,766
Where are you going?

86
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:26,228
To study English

87
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:28,939
Isamu too?
-Yes

88
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:33,777
Not TV again?
Don't go next door

89
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:40,742
Silly

90
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:48,208
Mrs. Hayashi

91
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:53,005
Excuse me

92
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:05,767
It's a funny question, but...

93
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:11,815
Did you hand over our dues
to our group head?

94
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:15,861
Yes, about 1 0 days ago

95
00:12:16,195 --> 00:12:20,407
I see. I thought so!

96
00:12:21,033 --> 00:12:26,997
But the Chairman said
she didn't receive them

97
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:30,125
Why?

98
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:37,174
Mrs. Haraguchi bought
a washing machine

99
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:40,010
But she wouldn't...

100
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:42,513
No, but...

101
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:46,642
Mrs. Okubo says
she handed them to you

102
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:52,940
Yes, she did.
Shall I ask our group head?

103
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:57,569
But ifshe's...

104
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:01,031
I handed them to her

105
00:13:01,323 --> 00:13:05,619
Ofcourse.
You never make mistakes

106
00:13:05,953 --> 00:13:08,413
What happened then?

107
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:12,251
It's distressing

108
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:39,361
Excuse me

109
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:45,200
Kozo, you're here again?
Why don't you listen?

110
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:47,661
How do you do

111
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:55,294
I'm sorry my son's always bothering you

112
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:59,298
What about your English lesson?

113
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:04,678
Minoru too?
Your mother will scold you, Zen

114
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:08,056
It must be such a nuisance foryou

115
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:11,059
We don't mind a bit

116
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:15,939
Hurry! Come home!
All ofyou!

117
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:20,068
I'm not going. I'm done studying

118
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:24,114
What? I'll tell your mother!
Come!

119
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,037
Excuse me

120
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,635
Good-bye

121
00:14:49,181 --> 00:14:53,310
Tell your teacher "Hello"
from Big Sister

122
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:58,774
You're Big Sister?

123
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:22,005
What was the hold up?
What about your English lesson?

124
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:40,065
Excuse me

125
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:43,068
Yes? Who is it?

126
00:15:46,822 --> 00:15:51,118
I heard from Mrs. Tomizawa

127
00:15:51,577 --> 00:15:54,288
But I handed over the dues

128
00:15:54,538 --> 00:15:58,125
to our group head long ago

129
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:04,423
But the fuss makes me
feel responsible

130
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:06,925
I really...

131
00:16:07,176 --> 00:16:11,346
Don't worry about it, Mrs. Hayashi

132
00:16:11,597 --> 00:16:15,100
We know it's not you

133
00:16:15,434 --> 00:16:18,228
You didn't have to comejust for that

134
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,147
But l...

135
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:24,067
It's because Mrs. Tomizawa mentioned

136
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:30,741
the washing machine, so l...

137
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:34,328
That doesn't concern me

138
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:38,957
Ofcourse not.
Not at all

139
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:44,671
But why hasn't the Chairman
received the dues yet?

140
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:48,759
It's so unpleasant foryou, isn't it?

141
00:16:49,218 --> 00:16:53,305
I'll ask Mrs. Haraguchi

142
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:56,266
I feel responsible

143
00:16:56,517 --> 00:17:02,523
Oh, I wouldn't do that.
It would be hard on her

144
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:04,775
But l...

145
00:17:05,067 --> 00:17:08,737
Don't worry.
We all trust you

146
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:16,453
Time will tell who's to blame.
Don't you worry

147
00:17:16,954 --> 00:17:20,749
It's a whodunit...
Iike that movie, remember?

148
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,668
But l...

149
00:17:22,918 --> 00:17:25,087
Don't you worry

150
00:17:59,872 --> 00:18:01,373
What are you doing?

151
00:18:12,968 --> 00:18:15,387
Did you do the translation?

152
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:17,097
I'm doing it right now

153
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:28,066
Are you done?

154
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:39,119
Read it

155
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:50,255
Translate it

156
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:57,429
My sister is three years old
and younger than me

157
00:18:58,013 --> 00:19:03,143
No, that's a bit different.
Ko?

158
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:11,443
Translate it

159
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:19,576
Go ahead, translate it

160
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:30,629
-Sorry, it's become a habit
-What?

161
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:35,300
We all do it now.
Push here again

162
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:44,309
Fool

163
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:48,021
-Are you all right?
-Sure

164
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:50,065
What is it?

165
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:56,613
I practice every day
eating pumice powder

166
00:19:56,905 --> 00:20:01,201
Stupid. Who said so?
-Zen's father

167
00:20:01,577 --> 00:20:06,290
It's not true.
He was teasing you

168
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:12,546
No, it's true. Isn't it?
He's good at it

169
00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:30,689
You called me?

170
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,526
No.
-I see

171
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,587
I'm back!

172
00:20:57,508 --> 00:20:59,927
I'm back!

173
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:08,685
Why don't you listen to me?
You were next door again.

174
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:14,399
-So what? We went to see TV.
-I said no!

175
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:17,694
-Buy us a TV then!
-Nonsense!

176
00:21:17,945 --> 00:21:23,075
Buy one.
-No! Eat your supper!

177
00:21:52,521 --> 00:21:56,275
Dried fish and miso soup again?

178
00:21:57,317 --> 00:21:58,902
Don't complain!

179
00:22:00,362 --> 00:22:02,948
You, too, lsamu?

180
00:22:05,868 --> 00:22:07,452
Not me

181
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:17,337
You're back?

182
00:22:18,797 --> 00:22:20,257
I'm home

183
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:25,095
-You were together?
-From the station

184
00:22:30,392 --> 00:22:34,479
-You're back
-We're having dried fish again

185
00:22:34,855 --> 00:22:38,609
You said you wouldn't complain!

186
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:46,325
The pork soup's good.
-Is it? Good

187
00:22:46,575 --> 00:22:49,161
No! Not every night!

188
00:22:56,877 --> 00:22:58,170
Aunt!

189
00:23:02,424 --> 00:23:08,722
My teacher said to wait for the
translation until tomorrow

190
00:23:09,097 --> 00:23:10,599
I see

191
00:23:11,433 --> 00:23:14,311
How was the sumo?

192
00:23:15,437 --> 00:23:19,274
I don't know.
We don't have a television set

193
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:23,028
Mom, buy us a TV set!

194
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:24,863
No!

195
00:23:25,697 --> 00:23:27,866
What about the radio?

196
00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:32,955
It has to be a TV.
You can't see on the radio

197
00:23:33,205 --> 00:23:37,751
Buy us a TV set!
-Buy us a TV set!

198
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,254
No, no! I said, "No!"

199
00:23:42,548 --> 00:23:44,299
Would you like a bath?

200
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:47,845
You filled the tub?

201
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:55,686
Who spilled the toothpaste?

202
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:58,981
-Not me
-Me neither

203
00:23:59,231 --> 00:24:00,691
Who then?

204
00:24:06,864 --> 00:24:08,323
I don't know

205
00:24:09,491 --> 00:24:11,326
Neither do I

206
00:24:50,532 --> 00:24:52,117
Good morning, sir

207
00:24:54,161 --> 00:24:55,496
Good morning

208
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:03,378
Don't dawdle on the way

209
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:14,723
Ready?

210
00:25:22,397 --> 00:25:23,899
No good

211
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,615
Good. Push me

212
00:25:32,783 --> 00:25:34,076
Let me

213
00:25:38,205 --> 00:25:39,790
How about it?

214
00:25:42,334 --> 00:25:46,088
You've gotten good.
Do you eat sweet potatoes?

215
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,673
No

216
00:26:03,856 --> 00:26:05,148
Did you call me?

217
00:26:05,941 --> 00:26:07,234
No

218
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:22,291
What is it?

219
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:28,297
I'm going to Kameido.
Do you want some sweets?

220
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:31,049
Yes, buy some

221
00:26:31,842 --> 00:26:33,677
It's a fine day

222
00:26:59,077 --> 00:27:00,245
Yes?

223
00:27:03,332 --> 00:27:04,917
Good morning

224
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:08,170
You're early

225
00:27:10,297 --> 00:27:13,967
Are you done with the translations?

226
00:27:14,635 --> 00:27:20,182
I have to look up
every technical term

227
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:24,436
My office wants it today

228
00:27:24,978 --> 00:27:28,982
-How is the rest?
-Let me see

229
00:27:30,943 --> 00:27:34,112
Will you take this much then?

230
00:27:40,577 --> 00:27:44,957
-I'll finish the rest today
-Ifyou will, please

231
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:49,419
Sis

232
00:27:56,677 --> 00:27:59,179
Welcome, I thought it was you

233
00:27:59,471 --> 00:28:02,558
-Good morning
-Good morning. To work already?

234
00:28:02,808 --> 00:28:06,186
I'm sorry to botheryour brother

235
00:28:06,562 --> 00:28:09,648
No, it's good sidework

236
00:28:10,065 --> 00:28:14,945
My company folded so
I'll do anything

237
00:28:15,696 --> 00:28:19,241
I'll take this.
Thanks

238
00:28:20,242 --> 00:28:27,833
Setsuko. There's talk about doing
The class reunion at Chinzanso

239
00:28:28,125 --> 00:28:33,005
Tell your sister.
-Yes, I will. Then...

240
00:28:34,506 --> 00:28:36,800
Good-bye.
-Excuse me

241
00:28:37,467 --> 00:28:38,969
Good-bye

242
00:28:42,181 --> 00:28:44,016
Setsuko's nice

243
00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:06,622
Wouldn't it be nice
ifshe married you?

244
00:29:06,955 --> 00:29:11,585
Are you joking?
I'm out ofa job now

245
00:29:12,336 --> 00:29:17,549
That's no problem.
You'll find a job

246
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:22,346
What about you?
How's yourjob?

247
00:29:23,847 --> 00:29:26,266
I may sell another Austin today

248
00:29:26,517 --> 00:29:29,144
I see. That's great

249
00:30:02,594 --> 00:30:04,680
It's an insult

250
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:41,884
Excuse me!
Anyone here?

251
00:30:43,343 --> 00:30:45,971
Excuse me!
-Yes

252
00:30:48,974 --> 00:30:54,021
Mrs. Haraguchi.
Come in from the front

253
00:30:54,646 --> 00:30:57,608
Never mind. A word

254
00:30:58,066 --> 00:31:01,403
What is it? Please come in

255
00:31:02,362 --> 00:31:05,616
It's a mess but please

256
00:31:06,325 --> 00:31:08,076
Excuse me then

257
00:31:19,463 --> 00:31:23,675
You know we bought
a washing machine

258
00:31:23,926 --> 00:31:26,303
Yes, I heard

259
00:31:26,553 --> 00:31:31,475
I want one too,
but I can't afford it yet

260
00:31:31,767 --> 00:31:34,102
Buy one ifyou want

261
00:31:34,353 --> 00:31:38,565
It's your own money.
Why worry?

262
00:31:38,815 --> 00:31:42,027
We're not rich like you

263
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:47,074
But we bought one
without bothering anyone else!

264
00:31:48,242 --> 00:31:51,662
Mother's making money too!

265
00:31:52,204 --> 00:31:56,625
We needn't steal the dues

266
00:31:57,626 --> 00:31:59,294
It's an insult!

267
00:31:59,711 --> 00:32:03,465
Who said such a thing?

268
00:32:04,633 --> 00:32:09,930
Don't pretend you don't know.
Askyourself

269
00:32:10,806 --> 00:32:15,686
What?
-I'm fastidious by nature!

270
00:32:16,186 --> 00:32:19,106
I'd never steal anything!

271
00:32:19,356 --> 00:32:23,819
This hateful gossip! I'm going to quit!

272
00:32:24,111 --> 00:32:27,197
I'll quit being group head!

273
00:32:28,198 --> 00:32:29,700
It's making a fool of me!

274
00:32:30,617 --> 00:32:34,079
I'm afraid I don't understand

275
00:32:35,706 --> 00:32:39,877
The dues. You're the treasurer

276
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,963
What about it?

277
00:32:44,089 --> 00:32:47,801
You said you gave me the dues?

278
00:32:48,218 --> 00:32:51,930
That sounds like I cheated!

279
00:32:52,472 --> 00:32:56,602
I haven't received the dues!

280
00:32:56,894 --> 00:32:59,980
I took them over.
I'm sure

281
00:33:00,272 --> 00:33:04,318
When?
-Last month... the 28th

282
00:33:04,568 --> 00:33:07,029
No!
-I did!

283
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:08,989
No!

284
00:33:09,406 --> 00:33:12,242
But I gave it to your mother...!

285
00:33:12,618 --> 00:33:15,704
Then she'd hand it over to me

286
00:33:16,121 --> 00:33:20,667
I wouldn't know. Ask her

287
00:33:22,169 --> 00:33:23,921
Excuse me

288
00:33:25,464 --> 00:33:27,174
Excuse me

289
00:33:29,468 --> 00:33:31,345
How do you do

290
00:33:32,763 --> 00:33:37,267
Want some rubber strings

291
00:33:38,185 --> 00:33:43,482
tooth-brushes, pencils, brushes?

292
00:33:43,815 --> 00:33:47,027
We have everything

293
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:50,948
I see. Everything?

294
00:33:51,782 --> 00:33:54,576
Everybody says so

295
00:33:55,702 --> 00:33:57,538
A pencil then?

296
00:34:00,374 --> 00:34:03,544
Very quiet here, isn't it?

297
00:34:03,961 --> 00:34:07,214
We don't need anything

298
00:34:08,423 --> 00:34:14,555
No? Don't say that.
How about it? Buy a pencil

299
00:34:16,098 --> 00:34:17,933
It cuts good

300
00:34:21,395 --> 00:34:24,731
How about you? Want a pencil?

301
00:34:25,816 --> 00:34:31,363
Pencils, rubber strings,
tooth-brushes, brushes?

302
00:34:35,784 --> 00:34:38,579
Hey, Missus

303
00:34:39,955 --> 00:34:41,790
Whatever...

304
00:34:56,388 --> 00:34:59,808
-Grandmother!
-What's the fuss?

305
00:35:00,058 --> 00:35:03,145
Did the vendor come?

306
00:35:03,645 --> 00:35:06,565
Will you go out when he comes?
He's awful

307
00:35:07,399 --> 00:35:11,278
What? What happened?

308
00:35:13,363 --> 00:35:16,241
Excuse me.
-See? He came!

309
00:35:17,201 --> 00:35:20,370
Yes, who is it?

310
00:35:25,626 --> 00:35:27,044
How do you do

311
00:35:33,926 --> 00:35:40,057
Rubber strings,
tooth-brushes, pencils

312
00:35:41,892 --> 00:35:43,977
Scrubbing brushes

313
00:35:49,274 --> 00:35:51,068
No, thanks

314
00:36:00,869 --> 00:36:04,915
It cuts good. Buy this pencil?

315
00:36:05,582 --> 00:36:12,130
No.
-Don't say that. Buy a pencil

316
00:36:12,714 --> 00:36:15,884
Can I sharpen it to see?

317
00:36:16,176 --> 00:36:21,557
Sure, sharpen it. You can

318
00:36:21,807 --> 00:36:27,771
Never mind.
I'll sharpen it with ours

319
00:36:32,568 --> 00:36:40,075
I've got cotton too. Want some?
-No

320
00:36:50,544 --> 00:36:53,130
Lend me the pencil

321
00:37:08,562 --> 00:37:10,939
It's sharp

322
00:37:12,316 --> 00:37:14,401
How much is this?

323
00:37:17,613 --> 00:37:19,156
50 yen

324
00:37:19,531 --> 00:37:22,618
It's expensive. Too expensive

325
00:37:37,758 --> 00:37:40,427
What's the matter? Leaving?

326
00:37:43,013 --> 00:37:44,723
Come again

327
00:37:46,141 --> 00:37:47,726
Shut the door

328
00:37:59,822 --> 00:38:05,077
-He left?
-Yes, he even left a pencil. See?

329
00:38:05,327 --> 00:38:10,874
-No one can beat you.
-Can't be a coward and be a midwife

330
00:38:16,046 --> 00:38:22,261
Listen, you didn't by any chance
receive the dues?

331
00:38:24,221 --> 00:38:27,140
I would have given it to you

332
00:38:27,474 --> 00:38:30,686
-You would?
-Yes

333
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:36,233
Mrs. Hayashi swears she paid you

334
00:38:36,984 --> 00:38:39,319
She didn't!

335
00:38:44,575 --> 00:38:45,868
What is it?

336
00:38:47,536 --> 00:38:49,496
Wait a minute

337
00:38:56,795 --> 00:38:58,088
This?

338
00:39:03,051 --> 00:39:04,887
Yes, this

339
00:39:05,929 --> 00:39:08,432
Why didn't you give it to me?

340
00:39:08,724 --> 00:39:10,309
But l...

341
00:39:13,395 --> 00:39:15,272
But what?

342
00:39:15,564 --> 00:39:20,986
Thanks to you,
I was ashamed everywhere!

343
00:39:21,737 --> 00:39:27,117
I'm the group head!
I'm blamed for everything!

344
00:39:27,784 --> 00:39:30,579
So senile

345
00:39:30,954 --> 00:39:37,044
Go to Mt. Narayama
where the old go to die!

346
00:39:39,171 --> 00:39:42,132
It makes me sick!

347
00:39:44,176 --> 00:39:46,970
Humiliated when I didn't need to be

348
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:50,224
Senile!

349
00:39:51,225 --> 00:39:53,352
It's the limit!

350
00:40:02,319 --> 00:40:04,947
Always fussing

351
00:40:05,656 --> 00:40:09,326
Thinks she grew up
all by herself!

352
00:40:09,701 --> 00:40:12,788
After driving me crazy

353
00:40:13,956 --> 00:40:17,167
Marrying a no-good husband

354
00:40:17,501 --> 00:40:20,963
Thinks she's hot stuff

355
00:40:21,213 --> 00:40:27,010
Bearing a son like that.
She's got some nerve

356
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,895
Excuse me again

357
00:40:37,938 --> 00:40:39,940
Sorry about earlier

358
00:40:45,445 --> 00:40:47,739
I'm so sorry

359
00:40:50,033 --> 00:40:54,329
My mother is terrible

360
00:40:55,414 --> 00:41:00,377
Shejust told me
she'd received the dues

361
00:41:01,003 --> 00:41:04,423
I don't know how to apologize

362
00:41:04,882 --> 00:41:07,092
I'm very sorry

363
00:41:07,509 --> 00:41:11,096
It's all right ifyou know

364
00:41:11,597 --> 00:41:13,515
I'm really sorry

365
00:41:13,807 --> 00:41:17,644
I'd like to crawl into a hole

366
00:41:17,936 --> 00:41:20,689
Please forget what I said

367
00:41:20,939 --> 00:41:25,110
I don't mind

368
00:41:25,611 --> 00:41:28,071
Really?
-It's over

369
00:41:28,363 --> 00:41:31,074
I'm so glad! Thanks

370
00:41:34,995 --> 00:41:40,292
Don't tell anybody, will you?
People gossip

371
00:41:40,542 --> 00:41:43,003
No, I won't

372
00:41:43,378 --> 00:41:46,381
Please. Excuse me

373
00:41:56,642 --> 00:41:59,645
Listen, Mrs. Haraguchi

374
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:05,317
How about this?

375
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:13,242
A bell to prevent crimes.
Patent's pending

376
00:42:13,492 --> 00:42:16,703
Push this for burglars and fires

377
00:42:16,995 --> 00:42:21,750
and it can be heard for 200 meters

378
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,794
A burglar alarm?

379
00:42:24,336 --> 00:42:28,131
For men who force sales too

380
00:42:28,549 --> 00:42:30,843
You should've come sooner

381
00:42:31,301 --> 00:42:33,554
Did he come here?

382
00:42:34,972 --> 00:42:40,519
I had to buy pencils.
Rubber bands, too

383
00:42:40,853 --> 00:42:47,818
That's why the police
recommend this

384
00:42:48,819 --> 00:42:51,738
How about one?

385
00:42:52,072 --> 00:42:55,159
Well... Shall I buy one?

386
00:42:55,868 --> 00:42:57,703
Your place?

387
00:42:57,953 --> 00:43:02,249
-I have a better one
-You do?

388
00:43:02,583 --> 00:43:06,712
Grandmother.
She can handle most men

389
00:43:17,222 --> 00:43:18,891
What a nice day

390
00:43:19,266 --> 00:43:20,934
Yes, it is

391
00:43:43,081 --> 00:43:48,670
UKIYO RESTAURANT

392
00:44:00,974 --> 00:44:02,267
It's empty

393
00:44:03,852 --> 00:44:06,813
One more!
-Yes

394
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:15,864
It's cold!

395
00:44:19,368 --> 00:44:24,748
-You're late
-I bought this when I went out

396
00:44:26,166 --> 00:44:31,088
Tomorrow's races?
You really like that?

397
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:35,467
How about the third race

398
00:44:36,385 --> 00:44:41,056
It's no good. No chance

399
00:44:41,306 --> 00:44:43,225
No?
-No

400
00:44:43,517 --> 00:44:45,394
The opposite?

401
00:44:45,686 --> 00:44:47,521
No good

402
00:44:47,771 --> 00:44:51,275
-Here you are
-You think?

403
00:44:53,694 --> 00:44:55,028
Me too

404
00:44:57,197 --> 00:44:58,782
One more

405
00:45:01,869 --> 00:45:03,370
Welcome

406
00:45:07,708 --> 00:45:11,044
Did I leave my glove here?

407
00:45:11,336 --> 00:45:15,215
No. Did you see it?

408
00:45:15,716 --> 00:45:18,093
No, I didn't

409
00:45:21,305 --> 00:45:23,015
Mr. Hayashi

410
00:45:25,726 --> 00:45:28,896
Sit down

411
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:32,107
Sit down

412
00:45:35,277 --> 00:45:38,030
Thanks

413
00:45:43,452 --> 00:45:45,162
Here you are

414
00:45:54,046 --> 00:45:56,340
Where to, today?

415
00:45:56,673 --> 00:46:03,972
No prospects but I have to eat

416
00:46:04,264 --> 00:46:06,266
Thanks

417
00:46:11,813 --> 00:46:13,816
When is it foryou?

418
00:46:20,656 --> 00:46:24,451
Retirement

419
00:46:24,952 --> 00:46:29,540
It's terrible.
Like being killed slowly

420
00:46:29,957 --> 00:46:35,587
Companies think we don't eat
after we retire

421
00:46:36,088 --> 00:46:39,550
But I eat and drink

422
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:47,850
My wife fusses
but I can't find a job

423
00:46:48,308 --> 00:46:51,770
I'm bogged down

424
00:46:53,021 --> 00:46:57,401
No place under the sky to hide

425
00:46:57,901 --> 00:47:00,571
It's very sad

426
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:06,785
But your retirement allowance...

427
00:47:07,161 --> 00:47:12,875
No, no, the company's smart

428
00:47:13,125 --> 00:47:16,545
and won't pay much

429
00:47:17,838 --> 00:47:22,426
For 30 years, rain or shine

430
00:47:26,013 --> 00:47:29,016
riding a crowded train

431
00:47:32,561 --> 00:47:35,397
It's all empty...futile

432
00:47:40,652 --> 00:47:42,279
Mr. Tomizawa

433
00:47:47,159 --> 00:47:49,411
Leave me alone

434
00:47:58,170 --> 00:48:02,049
Some well-cooked root cake

435
00:48:34,623 --> 00:48:38,210
What are you doing?
You're not eating?

436
00:48:39,086 --> 00:48:40,379
No!

437
00:48:42,589 --> 00:48:45,175
No? Don't then

438
00:48:48,387 --> 00:48:49,680
It's no fun!

439
00:49:01,233 --> 00:49:03,610
Behave or I'll...

440
00:49:04,653 --> 00:49:06,905
Stingy!

441
00:49:07,322 --> 00:49:10,492
Go hungry for all I care!

442
00:49:11,243 --> 00:49:12,995
Isamu?

443
00:49:13,829 --> 00:49:15,664
I won't eat

444
00:49:16,832 --> 00:49:18,584
Do as you wish

445
00:49:33,765 --> 00:49:38,687
Fools! How long are you going
to keep it up?

446
00:49:39,271 --> 00:49:42,024
Come here, lsamu!

447
00:49:43,066 --> 00:49:44,818
Isamu!

448
00:49:50,115 --> 00:49:51,700
I won't go

449
00:49:55,704 --> 00:50:01,084
Why are you so unreasonable?
I'll tell Father!

450
00:50:01,919 --> 00:50:05,589
I don't care! I'm not afraid!

451
00:50:09,468 --> 00:50:11,553
Here's Father!

452
00:50:14,389 --> 00:50:16,016
It's Father!

453
00:50:17,142 --> 00:50:18,644
You're home

454
00:50:19,978 --> 00:50:21,688
It's cold, no?

455
00:50:23,398 --> 00:50:29,488
Met Mr. Tomizawa at a pub.
He was pretty drunk

456
00:50:34,743 --> 00:50:37,788
-What's up?
-They're impossible

457
00:50:38,163 --> 00:50:41,959
-What's wrong?
-They won't listen to me at all

458
00:50:43,877 --> 00:50:47,130
-What?
-I tell them not to

459
00:50:47,422 --> 00:50:50,717
but they go next door
to watch TV anyway

460
00:50:51,009 --> 00:50:53,887
So buy us one!

461
00:50:55,222 --> 00:50:59,977
They went next door instead
of English class again today

462
00:51:00,561 --> 00:51:03,564
They're a big headache

463
00:51:04,022 --> 00:51:06,066
Then buy us a TV set!

464
00:51:07,109 --> 00:51:08,777
Buy one!

465
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:15,909
-No, no
-Then I'll go next door to watch TV!

466
00:51:16,201 --> 00:51:17,536
Me too!

467
00:51:18,662 --> 00:51:22,875
Stubborn children!
-I don't care!

468
00:51:23,167 --> 00:51:26,670
You're the stubborn one!
We go 'cuz there's no TV at home!

469
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:31,341
Wouldn't go ifwe had one!

470
00:51:32,217 --> 00:51:37,181
Be quiet!
-Stop it! Father will scold you!

471
00:51:37,514 --> 00:51:39,641
I'm not afraid!

472
00:51:40,225 --> 00:51:45,147
-Shut up! Quiet!
-I won't! I don't have to!

473
00:51:45,481 --> 00:51:49,193
Look here! What did you say?

474
00:51:49,651 --> 00:51:53,363
No, let me go! Let go!

475
00:51:53,655 --> 00:51:58,285
You talk too much!
Stop when I say so!

476
00:52:00,787 --> 00:52:03,707
I didn't say anything

477
00:52:04,625 --> 00:52:09,546
Fussing about a small thing
like a woman!

478
00:52:10,047 --> 00:52:14,968
You talk too much for a kid!
Keep quiet!

479
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:21,183
See? You got scolded!

480
00:52:22,184 --> 00:52:26,396
No! I want a TV set!

481
00:52:26,647 --> 00:52:28,649
That's too much talking!

482
00:52:28,941 --> 00:52:32,778
So do grownups!

483
00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:37,366
Hello. Good morning.
Good evening

484
00:52:37,616 --> 00:52:40,953
A fine day.
-Fool!

485
00:52:41,245 --> 00:52:45,791
Where to?Just a ways.
Is that so?

486
00:52:46,083 --> 00:52:48,001
Just a lot oftalk

487
00:52:48,293 --> 00:52:51,421
I see, I see. Screw that!

488
00:52:51,713 --> 00:52:54,091
Shut up! Be quiet!

489
00:53:00,222 --> 00:53:06,228
Boys shouldn't chatter!
Be quiet for a while!

490
00:53:07,354 --> 00:53:11,150
Okay, I will for days!

491
00:53:11,692 --> 00:53:15,362
Yes, I'd appreciate that

492
00:53:15,696 --> 00:53:21,326
1 00 days.
-Yes, be quiet! Don't talk!

493
00:53:22,578 --> 00:53:25,038
Come on, lsamu!

494
00:53:33,130 --> 00:53:35,048
Such a nuisance

495
00:53:51,899 --> 00:53:58,989
Don't answer, lsamu,
no matter what they say

496
00:53:59,239 --> 00:54:01,033
Get me? I mean it!

497
00:54:03,076 --> 00:54:05,787
Don't talk!

498
00:54:06,663 --> 00:54:10,417
-Outside too?
-Yes. A test!

499
00:54:18,008 --> 00:54:19,218
Me too!

500
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:26,517
Okay?
-Okay

501
00:54:27,684 --> 00:54:30,771
This means I can talk?
-Yes

502
00:54:43,116 --> 00:54:44,701
Farting is okay

503
00:54:57,673 --> 00:55:00,175
-I'm home
-You're back

504
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:02,594
You're late

505
00:55:07,850 --> 00:55:11,687
Miss Fukui said

506
00:55:11,979 --> 00:55:15,858
your class reunion may be
at Chinzanso

507
00:55:16,108 --> 00:55:19,194
I see. You went over?
-Yes

508
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:21,238
Where are the boys?

509
00:55:21,488 --> 00:55:23,198
In their room.
-I see

510
00:55:54,563 --> 00:55:57,399
Good. Good. Studying?

511
00:56:02,321 --> 00:56:04,740
Do you want some cake?

512
00:56:05,782 --> 00:56:07,868
It's good

513
00:56:18,128 --> 00:56:20,506
See?

514
00:56:31,141 --> 00:56:34,937
What is it? Don't want any?

515
00:56:41,026 --> 00:56:43,028
All right then

516
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:46,657
We'll eat it. It's awfully good

517
00:57:02,297 --> 00:57:04,758
I'm hungry. Aren't you?

518
00:57:56,101 --> 00:58:01,356
Time to eat, Grandmother!

519
00:58:30,928 --> 00:58:35,682
Buy some pants for him
on your way home

520
00:58:38,727 --> 00:58:40,270
Again?

521
00:58:40,604 --> 00:58:43,732
Yes. Cheap ones will do

522
00:58:48,237 --> 00:58:50,030
More?

523
00:58:54,493 --> 00:58:59,206
No, don't.
Your loose tummy won't get well

524
00:59:48,046 --> 00:59:49,256
More?

525
00:59:56,263 --> 01:00:01,518
Good. Good. It's so quiet.
Don't talk

526
01:00:12,529 --> 01:00:14,698
How long will it last?

527
01:00:31,381 --> 01:00:33,217
Say, "Good-bye."

528
01:00:43,602 --> 01:00:47,356
Good morning. You're early.
Kozo's coming

529
01:00:56,323 --> 01:00:59,284
Kozo. Kozo

530
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:09,711
Good morning. That's a nice scarf

531
01:01:38,323 --> 01:01:40,576
Did you have a fight with Minoru?

532
01:01:40,826 --> 01:01:42,578
No, I didn't

533
01:01:45,706 --> 01:01:46,999
I'm going

534
01:01:48,125 --> 01:01:51,670
What happened? It's funny

535
01:01:56,258 --> 01:01:58,302
Such strange children

536
01:02:00,179 --> 01:02:01,555
What's the matter?

537
01:02:02,598 --> 01:02:03,807
What's up?

538
01:02:06,518 --> 01:02:11,523
The children from across
don't even say hi

539
01:02:13,901 --> 01:02:15,819
What about it?

540
01:02:17,112 --> 01:02:23,452
But they both looked at me
and didn't say a word

541
01:02:24,328 --> 01:02:29,958
Is Mrs. Hayashi still mad at me
about yesterday?

542
01:02:31,335 --> 01:02:33,670
Yesterday?

543
01:02:34,004 --> 01:02:36,924
About the dues

544
01:02:37,466 --> 01:02:41,512
No. Those things happen

545
01:02:42,304 --> 01:02:45,891
It's Grandmother's fault

546
01:02:46,141 --> 01:02:48,977
She didn't tell me

547
01:02:49,812 --> 01:02:55,067
If I hadn't asked her,
she might have taken it

548
01:02:56,443 --> 01:02:59,238
I wouldn't!

549
01:03:00,113 --> 01:03:03,617
Everyone forgets

550
01:03:04,493 --> 01:03:08,163
I don't. Not important things

551
01:03:08,497 --> 01:03:15,504
You do forget! I know

552
01:03:15,838 --> 01:03:19,842
What? What did I forget?

553
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:25,472
The gas bill I paid

554
01:03:25,848 --> 01:03:31,645
That's all! You do too!
lgnoring your faults!

555
01:03:33,355 --> 01:03:37,568
Stop it, stop it!
Stop it now!

556
01:03:41,363 --> 01:03:42,781
I'm going

557
01:03:58,088 --> 01:04:02,801
Saying you don't forget!

558
01:04:03,385 --> 01:04:06,597
Forgetting to pay me back!

559
01:04:07,389 --> 01:04:09,975
Always yakking

560
01:04:11,602 --> 01:04:15,606
Why did I have a daughter like her?

561
01:04:28,619 --> 01:04:30,787
Good morning

562
01:04:30,996 --> 01:04:33,707
Good morning.
Your husband's left?

563
01:04:36,668 --> 01:04:38,754
Listen

564
01:04:45,344 --> 01:04:47,804
She's funny

565
01:04:48,055 --> 01:04:49,848
Lingerie woman?

566
01:04:50,265 --> 01:04:53,352
She's impossible too.
Mrs. Hayashi

567
01:04:53,685 --> 01:04:59,191
-What?
-I was late with the dues

568
01:04:59,441 --> 01:05:03,612
So she tells everyone I bought
a washer with it

569
01:05:03,946 --> 01:05:06,782
She did? That's awful

570
01:05:07,032 --> 01:05:11,495
Yes. I went over to complain

571
01:05:11,787 --> 01:05:14,498
And she apologized

572
01:05:14,790 --> 01:05:17,167
It was settled

573
01:05:17,376 --> 01:05:22,130
But she's still mad.
She told her kids too

574
01:05:22,381 --> 01:05:25,926
This morning I spoke to them
but they ignored me

575
01:05:26,176 --> 01:05:29,805
I couldn't do it

576
01:05:30,055 --> 01:05:33,142
I see! ls she like that?

577
01:05:33,433 --> 01:05:37,980
Yes. I'm surprised at her

578
01:05:38,397 --> 01:05:41,650
I wouldn't have thought it of her

579
01:05:42,025 --> 01:05:45,487
Be careful. She holds grudges

580
01:05:45,737 --> 01:05:48,949
I see. Maybe she does

581
01:05:50,242 --> 01:05:53,245
Should I return the beer
I owe her?

582
01:05:53,495 --> 01:05:55,330
You borrowed some?

583
01:05:55,622 --> 01:05:58,292
You were out of it

584
01:05:58,584 --> 01:06:02,462
That night? You better hurry
and return it

585
01:06:02,754 --> 01:06:06,925
Yes. I'm glad you told me

586
01:06:12,306 --> 01:06:13,891
Good morning

587
01:06:54,431 --> 01:06:58,477
Excuse me.
-Oh, hello

588
01:07:04,983 --> 01:07:07,528
I forgot all about the beer

589
01:07:08,403 --> 01:07:10,656
I borrowed the other day

590
01:07:13,617 --> 01:07:18,080
There's no hurry to return it

591
01:07:18,580 --> 01:07:23,502
And the bus ticket
you paid for me

592
01:07:24,169 --> 01:07:30,300
It's all right.
-No, I must return it

593
01:07:31,218 --> 01:07:33,011
Excuse me

594
01:08:00,831 --> 01:08:06,003
Mrs. Tomizawa. Are you in?

595
01:08:11,049 --> 01:08:13,468
Mrs. Okubo's here

596
01:08:17,139 --> 01:08:19,266
Welcome

597
01:08:20,851 --> 01:08:24,980
Ifyou've borrowed something
from Mrs. Hayashi

598
01:08:25,230 --> 01:08:29,526
return it.
-Why?

599
01:08:29,860 --> 01:08:34,448
She holds grudges
about small things

600
01:08:34,740 --> 01:08:38,118
No. I've borrowed a lot in the past

601
01:08:38,410 --> 01:08:43,040
But she does I was told

602
01:08:43,332 --> 01:08:45,042
I'm surprised too

603
01:08:45,292 --> 01:08:50,672
She seems educated
but one can never tell

604
01:08:51,298 --> 01:08:53,133
Maybe so

605
01:08:54,051 --> 01:09:00,265
Our cat stole her dried fish.
Should I return it?

606
01:09:00,599 --> 01:09:05,103
Yes, you should!
-I see

607
01:09:05,771 --> 01:09:09,107
I did too. A load off my mind!

608
01:09:25,249 --> 01:09:28,210
You understand the game?

609
01:09:29,461 --> 01:09:31,755
Begin with the last letter

610
01:09:31,964 --> 01:09:36,593
Crow-worm-moon

611
01:09:39,763 --> 01:09:42,141
Next?

612
01:09:46,395 --> 01:09:48,063
Akita

613
01:09:48,689 --> 01:09:51,608
Moonlight Mask Man

614
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:57,239
No, it has to begin with an "N"

615
01:10:04,121 --> 01:10:05,956
Shimizu

616
01:10:06,290 --> 01:10:09,126
Suzunosuke

617
01:10:09,459 --> 01:10:12,838
No, no. The letter "N"

618
01:10:18,218 --> 01:10:19,636
Hayashi

619
01:10:24,141 --> 01:10:27,603
What begins with "N"?

620
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:36,945
There are lots ofthem,
aren't there?

621
01:10:40,365 --> 01:10:43,619
What's the matter?

622
01:10:47,456 --> 01:10:52,920
Is anything wrong? The lavatory?

623
01:10:56,507 --> 01:11:00,469
What's that?
What is it?

624
01:11:02,554 --> 01:11:04,389
What?

625
01:11:09,269 --> 01:11:13,982
Read it. Read it for me

626
01:11:22,825 --> 01:11:26,119
Speak up. You can read it

627
01:11:29,081 --> 01:11:31,166
You know the words

628
01:11:35,003 --> 01:11:36,672
Stand there

629
01:11:44,888 --> 01:11:47,015
That's all

630
01:11:48,851 --> 01:11:54,398
Don't forget to bring
your lunch money tomorrow

631
01:11:56,567 --> 01:11:57,901
Don't forget

632
01:11:58,569 --> 01:12:02,281
Bring your lunch money tomorrow

633
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:10,330
Understand?
Raise your hand ifyou do

634
01:13:01,798 --> 01:13:06,720
What about our lunch money?
Can I tell Mother?

635
01:13:07,095 --> 01:13:09,348
No! Don't talk!

636
01:13:09,598 --> 01:13:11,266
What will we do?

637
01:13:30,410 --> 01:13:34,581
How long can they keep it up?

638
01:13:35,249 --> 01:13:40,796
Ignoring them is best.
It's the rebellious period

639
01:13:41,380 --> 01:13:44,508
So much like their father in funny ways

640
01:13:47,469 --> 01:13:48,679
What?

641
01:13:49,263 --> 01:13:51,765
So very stubborn

642
01:13:52,099 --> 01:13:53,934
They took afteryou

643
01:13:54,393 --> 01:13:56,854
That's not true

644
01:13:57,604 --> 01:13:59,982
I wonder

645
01:14:07,447 --> 01:14:08,657
What is it?

646
01:14:14,580 --> 01:14:17,374
What is it?
-What is it?

647
01:14:26,758 --> 01:14:28,051
What do you think?

648
01:14:29,178 --> 01:14:32,973
I wonder. Any idea?

649
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:35,309
No

650
01:14:40,856 --> 01:14:42,649
What is it?

651
01:14:46,111 --> 01:14:49,781
A building? A big house?

652
01:14:50,657 --> 01:14:54,786
The Federal building?
A temple? A hospital?

653
01:14:55,037 --> 01:14:56,830
No?

654
01:14:57,664 --> 01:14:59,500
Oh, school?

655
01:14:59,791 --> 01:15:02,419
School? What about school?

656
01:15:07,090 --> 01:15:09,009
It's on fire?

657
01:15:09,676 --> 01:15:14,097
Not a fire? It's not a fire?

658
01:15:17,643 --> 01:15:20,771
Drink tea? Then what?

659
01:15:23,982 --> 01:15:26,318
Drink tea, then eat?

660
01:15:31,365 --> 01:15:33,867
Money? It's money?

661
01:15:38,997 --> 01:15:43,544
The firemen put out the fire,

662
01:15:43,877 --> 01:15:46,421
you gave them tea and you paid them

663
01:15:49,299 --> 01:15:51,760
What?
-What is it?

664
01:16:04,189 --> 01:16:06,024
Do you know?

665
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:11,113
No, I don't. What is it about?

666
01:16:12,739 --> 01:16:14,575
What is it?

667
01:16:15,576 --> 01:16:17,411
I wonder

668
01:17:01,288 --> 01:17:02,706
He's good

669
01:17:03,832 --> 01:17:07,002
Sure. He works
for the gas company

670
01:17:13,050 --> 01:17:17,304
Minoru's good too
but now he won't talk

671
01:17:19,181 --> 01:17:21,767
Not even at school

672
01:17:59,972 --> 01:18:04,810
Why won't you talk?

673
01:18:16,113 --> 01:18:18,031
It's pretty inconvenient, right?

674
01:18:26,623 --> 01:18:30,169
What's the matter?

675
01:18:33,922 --> 01:18:35,632
Did you make a vow?

676
01:18:37,384 --> 01:18:38,844
What is it?

677
01:18:59,531 --> 01:19:01,158
Fools

678
01:19:04,411 --> 01:19:07,539
Still eating pumice powder?

679
01:19:10,250 --> 01:19:16,423
Keep it up.
You'll die ofa stomach full ofstones

680
01:19:19,301 --> 01:19:22,304
Really?
-Yes

681
01:19:22,805 --> 01:19:25,265
That seal that died at the zoo?

682
01:19:25,891 --> 01:19:29,478
It was full ofstones

683
01:19:30,229 --> 01:19:35,734
It thought the stones
the visitors threw were food

684
01:19:38,403 --> 01:19:39,655
Who is it?

685
01:19:40,781 --> 01:19:44,076
Hello.
-It's you? What is it?

686
01:19:44,827 --> 01:19:49,706
You're here, boys?
Why don't you come and watch TV?

687
01:19:50,666 --> 01:19:54,169
Any vacant rooms here?

688
01:19:54,503 --> 01:19:57,881
I don't think so.
Ask downstairs

689
01:19:58,841 --> 01:20:02,344
Do you know ofany somewhere else?

690
01:20:02,678 --> 01:20:05,764
I don't know. For who?

691
01:20:06,098 --> 01:20:12,771
Me. I want to move.
The neighbors are such a nuisance

692
01:20:13,021 --> 01:20:18,569
Don't you know any place?

693
01:20:20,821 --> 01:20:24,950
You're not kind, are you?
Good-bye

694
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:42,885
Yes?

695
01:20:45,345 --> 01:20:47,431
It's you?

696
01:20:47,931 --> 01:20:49,683
Hello

697
01:20:51,477 --> 01:20:53,729
You're here?

698
01:20:54,146 --> 01:20:56,773
I have another translation

699
01:20:57,441 --> 01:20:59,860
That other work was okay?

700
01:21:01,820 --> 01:21:05,574
I'll come for it in 4 or 5 days

701
01:21:05,949 --> 01:21:09,661
I see. The work's a great help

702
01:21:12,414 --> 01:21:13,999
Thanks

703
01:21:14,666 --> 01:21:18,837
What happened? They won't talk

704
01:21:19,922 --> 01:21:22,925
They were scolded
for talking too much

705
01:21:23,175 --> 01:21:25,719
so they won't talk

706
01:21:26,553 --> 01:21:28,597
That's interesting

707
01:21:29,431 --> 01:21:31,350
What did you say?

708
01:21:38,232 --> 01:21:41,151
Say, lsamu

709
01:21:43,111 --> 01:21:45,113
What happened?

710
01:21:45,656 --> 01:21:50,452
They said grownups
talk too much too

711
01:21:50,702 --> 01:21:55,999
Good morning. Good evening.
Good day. A fine day

712
01:21:57,209 --> 01:22:02,673
I see. It's true

713
01:22:02,965 --> 01:22:06,176
We all say that

714
01:22:06,635 --> 01:22:11,765
Yes, we do.
But maybe it's necessary

715
01:22:12,099 --> 01:22:16,395
It'd be a boring world
ifwe didn't

716
01:22:16,728 --> 01:22:23,110
Yes, but the children
don't understand yet

717
01:22:23,443 --> 01:22:26,613
No, they wouldn't know that yet

718
01:22:27,406 --> 01:22:32,244
But isn't it necessary
in our world?

719
01:22:35,497 --> 01:22:37,875
I think so

720
01:22:39,376 --> 01:22:44,464
Say, lsamu.
What are you mad about?

721
01:22:50,554 --> 01:22:53,765
Is that so? I see

722
01:22:55,142 --> 01:22:59,855
Is it?
Have a drink

723
01:23:05,736 --> 01:23:09,406
-Is it too much?
-No, no. Not at all

724
01:23:09,948 --> 01:23:12,409
Never mind

725
01:23:12,784 --> 01:23:17,789
Drinking, smoking
are a waste oftime too

726
01:23:18,123 --> 01:23:20,167
but why worry?

727
01:23:21,543 --> 01:23:24,004
That's all right

728
01:23:24,588 --> 01:23:32,012
I know how the kids feel
when they askyou to buy it

729
01:23:32,346 --> 01:23:36,266
I'd like one too,
but can't afford it

730
01:23:36,934 --> 01:23:42,272
That's not the problem.
I'm against buying one

731
01:23:43,190 --> 01:23:49,905
Someone said TV would produce
1 00 million idiots

732
01:23:50,155 --> 01:23:54,409
Is that so? What does that mean?

733
01:23:54,660 --> 01:23:59,248
It means all Japanese will become idiots

734
01:23:59,623 --> 01:24:05,379
That would be pretty terrible

735
01:24:05,712 --> 01:24:08,674
But what does it really mean?

736
01:24:09,424 --> 01:24:12,386
What do you think about it?

737
01:24:15,931 --> 01:24:19,768
What?
-About television?

738
01:24:20,144 --> 01:24:24,690
Television?
The 1 00 million idiots?

739
01:24:26,567 --> 01:24:33,991
You knew?
-Yes. TV sets are a nuisance

740
01:24:34,408 --> 01:24:36,785
Think so too?

741
01:24:39,496 --> 01:24:41,832
You don't say

742
01:24:45,919 --> 01:24:50,883
Too many conveniences
are no good?

743
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:55,721
You're right.
-It's a problem

744
01:25:10,486 --> 01:25:11,778
I'm back

745
01:25:27,628 --> 01:25:30,714
Come to visit us, son?

746
01:25:31,048 --> 01:25:34,843
I'm glad you came. Good boy

747
01:25:39,890 --> 01:25:41,934
You're back?

748
01:25:42,810 --> 01:25:46,146
I'm sorry, Mrs. Hayashi

749
01:25:46,647 --> 01:25:51,151
My wife's out?
Thanks for housesitting

750
01:25:51,610 --> 01:25:55,030
Your home's next door

751
01:25:58,951 --> 01:26:01,328
Sorry, sorry

752
01:26:03,580 --> 01:26:05,374
Shall I help you?

753
01:26:06,250 --> 01:26:08,126
No, I'm all right

754
01:26:32,818 --> 01:26:34,528
I'm back

755
01:26:38,991 --> 01:26:41,451
I feel good

756
01:26:42,119 --> 01:26:45,289
You drank again?

757
01:26:48,250 --> 01:26:51,837
Right this time! My own home!

758
01:26:53,964 --> 01:26:56,633
I feel good

759
01:26:58,010 --> 01:27:01,054
Feeling good! The idea!

760
01:27:01,763 --> 01:27:06,643
I feel good. Shut up

761
01:27:10,772 --> 01:27:14,151
It feels good

762
01:27:56,819 --> 01:28:00,405
Listen, are you through?

763
01:28:01,156 --> 01:28:02,616
Not yet

764
01:28:07,579 --> 01:28:09,540
The truck?

765
01:28:10,290 --> 01:28:15,212
It'll come around 3.
Hurry

766
01:28:24,429 --> 01:28:28,142
Are you hurrying? What are
you doing?

767
01:28:45,159 --> 01:28:48,370
Next door is moving, I think

768
01:28:48,704 --> 01:28:54,543
I see. Neighbors here are a pain

769
01:28:55,627 --> 01:28:58,672
I feel like moving out too

770
01:28:58,922 --> 01:29:03,260
Neighbors everywhere

771
01:29:03,594 --> 01:29:08,390
-Unless you live in the mountains
-True

772
01:29:09,766 --> 01:29:14,563
Do mice gnaw on pumice stone?

773
01:29:15,522 --> 01:29:20,194
I don't think they do

774
01:29:20,611 --> 01:29:24,740
No. But it's going fast

775
01:29:25,866 --> 01:29:28,869
Shall I rub rat poison on it?

776
01:29:53,977 --> 01:29:59,441
I'm hungry.
No snacks for a long time now

777
01:30:03,278 --> 01:30:08,826
We won't die? Let's not eat
pumice stones any more

778
01:30:14,957 --> 01:30:20,295
We're not so full ofstones yet?

779
01:30:24,591 --> 01:30:25,968
Excuse me

780
01:30:31,265 --> 01:30:32,558
Excuse me

781
01:30:34,476 --> 01:30:37,729
-It's our teacher!
-What'll we do?

782
01:30:39,314 --> 01:30:40,732
Come!

783
01:31:29,990 --> 01:31:33,160
Is that so?

784
01:31:33,494 --> 01:31:37,915
I scolded them
for talking too much

785
01:31:38,415 --> 01:31:43,796
I see. It's all right
since I know now

786
01:31:44,087 --> 01:31:47,049
Isamu won't talk either

787
01:31:47,382 --> 01:31:51,094
I'm sorry we troubled you

788
01:31:51,386 --> 01:31:55,724
Raising children is very hard

789
01:31:56,058 --> 01:31:59,520
Please use Spartan methods

790
01:31:59,812 --> 01:32:04,483
We don't mind.
-No, I'm afraid not

791
01:32:06,109 --> 01:32:12,908
A guest?
-Please come in. I'm leaving

792
01:32:13,158 --> 01:32:15,577
Excuse me

793
01:32:15,828 --> 01:32:20,374
Thankyou. They'll bring
the money tomorrow

794
01:32:20,707 --> 01:32:23,752
Yes. Excuse me

795
01:32:26,922 --> 01:32:30,342
Come in, Mr. Tomizawa.
-Thanks. Excuse me

796
01:32:35,305 --> 01:32:37,474
Nice weather, isn't it?

797
01:32:37,933 --> 01:32:42,479
Yes. A spell of nice weather

798
01:33:43,123 --> 01:33:47,294
Welcome.
-I'm sorry about last night

799
01:33:47,586 --> 01:33:50,547
My wife gave it to me

800
01:33:52,633 --> 01:33:54,843
You seemed very happy

801
01:33:58,138 --> 01:34:03,310
Please be glad for me.
I found a job

802
01:34:03,811 --> 01:34:07,314
That's great

803
01:34:07,981 --> 01:34:11,485
It's not a big company

804
01:34:11,944 --> 01:34:15,823
Kowa Electric Co. Know it?

805
01:34:16,156 --> 01:34:20,118
Across from an eatery.
I'm in Sales

806
01:34:20,452 --> 01:34:23,539
That's excellent

807
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:34,675
Hard work though.
I must go from door to door

808
01:34:35,968 --> 01:34:42,141
I see. Toasters, mixers...

809
01:34:50,315 --> 01:34:52,568
Washing machines too

810
01:34:52,860 --> 01:34:55,320
How about buying one?

811
01:34:55,571 --> 01:34:57,447
We can't

812
01:34:58,615 --> 01:35:01,827
How about buying something?

813
01:35:04,746 --> 01:35:08,584
We have installments too

814
01:35:09,459 --> 01:35:15,674
We must buy something to celebrate
your newjob

815
01:35:16,216 --> 01:35:20,679
Please do that.
I have other catalogues

816
01:35:21,013 --> 01:35:24,725
I'll get them. Won't be a minute

817
01:35:41,783 --> 01:35:45,996
It's time for us to think about it too

818
01:35:47,539 --> 01:35:48,999
What?

819
01:35:50,125 --> 01:35:51,752
Retirement

820
01:37:03,490 --> 01:37:05,951
Want some tea?

821
01:37:06,368 --> 01:37:08,370
Yes, I do

822
01:37:23,343 --> 01:37:25,637
A mess, isn't it?

823
01:37:26,847 --> 01:37:29,683
Yes. Fun, isn't it?

824
01:37:37,065 --> 01:37:38,692
I want rice

825
01:37:59,379 --> 01:38:01,340
It tastes good

826
01:38:05,552 --> 01:38:07,554
I'd like some side dish too

827
01:38:08,013 --> 01:38:11,517
Shall I get it?
-Yes, get some

828
01:38:56,019 --> 01:38:57,521
Minoru!

829
01:39:22,337 --> 01:39:23,547
Hurry up!

830
01:40:08,550 --> 01:40:09,760
Who is it?

831
01:40:20,729 --> 01:40:22,981
Hello.
-Good evening

832
01:40:25,067 --> 01:40:27,528
Our boys aren't here?

833
01:40:27,778 --> 01:40:30,239
No. Anything wrong?

834
01:40:30,572 --> 01:40:33,784
Did they come at all?

835
01:40:34,117 --> 01:40:36,954
No, not today

836
01:40:41,917 --> 01:40:47,381
What is it?
-They went out in the afternoon

837
01:40:47,881 --> 01:40:51,426
You must be worried

838
01:40:51,718 --> 01:40:57,266
Yes. But they may be home now.
Excuse me

839
01:40:57,599 --> 01:40:59,143
Take care

840
01:41:03,438 --> 01:41:04,815
What happened?

841
01:41:24,126 --> 01:41:29,298
Funny kids.
They're not talking yet?

842
01:41:29,715 --> 01:41:31,884
It's rather interesting

843
01:41:32,718 --> 01:41:35,971
For children

844
01:41:36,305 --> 01:41:40,058
our greetings may seem
like a waste oftime

845
01:41:40,392 --> 01:41:46,565
I do it all the time to sell cars.
I have to

846
01:41:46,857 --> 01:41:52,029
Yes, it acts as a lubricant
in this world

847
01:41:53,322 --> 01:41:56,366
But important things are difficult to say

848
01:41:56,742 --> 01:42:00,954
Whereas meaningless things are
easy to say

849
01:42:02,331 --> 01:42:04,208
You too

850
01:42:07,252 --> 01:42:10,923
-Can't admit you're in love.
-What?

851
01:42:11,215 --> 01:42:18,138
About Setsuko. You only talk
ofthe weather and work

852
01:42:18,514 --> 01:42:23,811
You're wrong.
-I'm not wrong. I know

853
01:42:28,148 --> 01:42:30,651
Get around to important things

854
01:42:37,032 --> 01:42:43,121
Go out and look?
-What?

855
01:42:43,372 --> 01:42:48,335
The kids. They're out since afternoon?
It's too long

856
01:42:49,795 --> 01:42:53,465
Yes. Shall I look for them?

857
01:42:53,924 --> 01:42:56,176
Yes, you do that

858
01:43:03,725 --> 01:43:06,436
It's cold.
Wear something warm

859
01:43:24,788 --> 01:43:27,499
Check in front ofthe movie houses

860
01:44:18,509 --> 01:44:21,762
I'm back. Are they home?

861
01:44:22,095 --> 01:44:24,473
Not yet.
-I see

862
01:44:27,684 --> 01:44:31,230
I went to his apartment

863
01:44:31,522 --> 01:44:33,482
What's that?

864
01:44:33,941 --> 01:44:36,401
I got it at the police station

865
01:44:37,277 --> 01:44:40,572
They left them and ran away

866
01:44:42,449 --> 01:44:44,409
-Where did they go?
-The nuisances

867
01:44:45,369 --> 01:44:48,413
Where'd they go?

868
01:44:53,293 --> 01:44:57,339
I'll go and look.
-No, I'll go

869
01:44:57,756 --> 01:45:02,803
Where'd they go?
-The nuisances

870
01:45:05,597 --> 01:45:08,142
It's cold. Wear something warm

871
01:45:10,602 --> 01:45:11,895
Good evening

872
01:45:20,237 --> 01:45:24,491
Good evening.
Come in

873
01:45:28,620 --> 01:45:33,834
Where were you?
They're back

874
01:45:36,503 --> 01:45:38,964
Please don't scold them

875
01:45:39,465 --> 01:45:43,635
They were watching TV in front
ofthe station

876
01:45:47,431 --> 01:45:53,812
Thankyou very much.
-Idiots. You made us worry

877
01:45:57,316 --> 01:45:59,651
Excuse me

878
01:46:01,278 --> 01:46:05,616
Thankyou very much.
-Thanks a lot

879
01:46:06,408 --> 01:46:08,660
Good-bye

880
01:46:14,374 --> 01:46:15,626
Come in

881
01:46:21,256 --> 01:46:24,802
Don't worry. Come in

882
01:46:31,850 --> 01:46:33,393
Come on up

883
01:46:35,938 --> 01:46:37,523
Come on

884
01:46:54,540 --> 01:46:56,542
Great

885
01:46:56,917 --> 01:47:00,254
TV!
-It's awesome!

886
01:47:08,178 --> 01:47:12,724
You bought it?
-You really bought it?

887
01:47:13,016 --> 01:47:16,103
Yes, Father did

888
01:47:16,854 --> 01:47:22,401
It's awesome!
-Mr. Tomizawa brought it over

889
01:47:22,860 --> 01:47:26,196
How much?
-It's expensive!

890
01:47:26,488 --> 01:47:29,867
How much?
-Never mind

891
01:47:30,284 --> 01:47:35,247
You two study hard now.
-Yes, I will!

892
01:47:35,539 --> 01:47:36,874
Thanks!

893
01:47:46,925 --> 01:47:54,099
Are we lucky! Nice?
We can watch baseball too

894
01:47:54,766 --> 01:47:56,810
Are we lucky!

895
01:47:59,646 --> 01:48:02,232
Aren't you hungry?

896
01:48:02,774 --> 01:48:07,696
No. Teacher treated us
to noodles

897
01:48:07,946 --> 01:48:10,157
Dumplings too

898
01:48:10,449 --> 01:48:12,367
I see. Not hungry, then?

899
01:48:15,037 --> 01:48:16,872
I'm so happy!

900
01:48:26,715 --> 01:48:28,050
Look here!

901
01:48:32,554 --> 01:48:35,599
Ifyou're so noisy,
I'll return it!

902
01:48:40,479 --> 01:48:45,359
He's lying. His face says so

903
01:48:45,943 --> 01:48:48,070
He's smiling

904
01:49:38,912 --> 01:49:41,248
I'm going!
-I'm going!

905
01:49:43,917 --> 01:49:47,880
Have the TV ready
when we come home!

906
01:49:48,714 --> 01:49:50,716
We're off!

907
01:50:03,562 --> 01:50:05,439
Good morning!

908
01:50:05,731 --> 01:50:07,441
Did Kozo go?

909
01:50:10,944 --> 01:50:13,864
Kozo. Kozo

910
01:50:17,201 --> 01:50:19,328
Good morning!

911
01:50:19,620 --> 01:50:21,497
Did Zen go?

912
01:50:23,540 --> 01:50:26,001
Yes, hejust left

913
01:50:28,545 --> 01:50:31,340
Hurry up, Ko!

914
01:50:36,386 --> 01:50:37,888
I'm going!

915
01:50:57,825 --> 01:51:01,161
What's going on?

916
01:51:01,453 --> 01:51:05,749
They talked, didn't they?

917
01:51:06,041 --> 01:51:07,876
What happened?

918
01:51:09,336 --> 01:51:11,922
Listen, Mrs. Tomizawa!

919
01:51:14,007 --> 01:51:15,425
What is it?

920
01:51:18,095 --> 01:51:21,974
Hello. What is it?

921
01:51:22,641 --> 01:51:28,355
The Hayashi boys were
very cheerful this morning

922
01:51:28,647 --> 01:51:33,485
Yes. They said, "Good morning"

923
01:51:33,735 --> 01:51:37,447
You've got them all wrong

924
01:51:37,739 --> 01:51:42,536
That family is nice and Mrs. Hayashi's
very understanding

925
01:51:43,954 --> 01:51:48,709
Think so?
-Yes, you're wrong

926
01:51:49,293 --> 01:51:51,879
I'm going shopping. Need anything?

927
01:51:52,629 --> 01:51:54,339
No? Then...

928
01:52:01,263 --> 01:52:04,600
What's happened to her?

929
01:52:05,017 --> 01:52:11,773
The Hayashis bought
a hot plate or something

930
01:52:12,232 --> 01:52:16,653
Yes. A calculating woman

931
01:52:28,832 --> 01:52:32,002
You still eat pumice stone?

932
01:52:33,879 --> 01:52:36,590
It's bad foryou.
You'll die

933
01:52:39,635 --> 01:52:43,889
I quit.
Changed to burdock

934
01:52:44,306 --> 01:52:45,933
Push me

935
01:52:51,688 --> 01:52:53,190
Me too

936
01:52:56,860 --> 01:52:58,570
You now

937
01:53:03,492 --> 01:53:07,162
No good. You're no good now

938
01:53:15,420 --> 01:53:17,422
What's the matter?

939
01:53:19,550 --> 01:53:22,719
I'm going home

940
01:53:32,271 --> 01:53:33,981
I'll come later

941
01:54:19,193 --> 01:54:21,028
Good morning

942
01:54:21,487 --> 01:54:24,156
Good morning.
Thanks for last night

943
01:54:26,575 --> 01:54:27,993
Where to?

944
01:54:28,702 --> 01:54:30,412
To West Ginza

945
01:54:30,871 --> 01:54:33,123
Then we can go together

946
01:54:37,795 --> 01:54:41,048
A fine day, isn't it?

947
01:54:41,381 --> 01:54:46,512
Yes, really. A fine day

948
01:54:49,848 --> 01:54:53,477
It'll be nice weather for a while?

949
01:54:53,727 --> 01:54:59,233
Yes, it looks like
nice weather for a while

950
01:54:59,483 --> 01:55:04,988
That cloud's an interesting shape

951
01:55:08,325 --> 01:55:11,787
Yes, it's an interesting shape

952
01:55:12,788 --> 01:55:14,998
Looks like something

953
01:55:15,290 --> 01:55:18,085
Yes, like something

954
01:55:21,505 --> 01:55:23,382
A nice day

955
01:55:27,386 --> 01:55:30,222
Yes, a really fine day

956
01:55:49,241 --> 01:55:53,912
You're a fool! A big boy too!

957
01:55:56,123 --> 01:55:57,833
Such a bother!

958
01:56:01,712 --> 01:56:05,716
I won't die, will l?

959
01:56:06,216 --> 01:56:08,677
I swallowed pumice stone
by mistake

960
01:56:09,887 --> 01:56:14,183
You're better offdead!
Absent from school!

961
01:56:17,019 --> 01:56:21,482
I won't feed you till you're well

962
01:56:25,194 --> 01:56:30,073
Give me clean underwear, Mother?

963
01:56:31,074 --> 01:56:36,914
Don't wear any until you're well!

964
01:57:13,158 --> 01:57:20,207
THE END
