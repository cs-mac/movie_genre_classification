1
00:00:27,206 --> 00:00:28,878
Wait!

2
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:35,737
Somebody told me,
love is like waiting for a bus.

3
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:40,053
The one that arrives isn't
the one you expected.

4
00:00:41,538 --> 00:00:45,087
And when the one
you expected arrives,

5
00:00:47,621 --> 00:00:50,215
there will be obstacles blocking
the way to get on it.

6
00:00:50,663 --> 00:00:52,415
This happens all the time.

7
00:01:07,828 --> 00:01:09,784
I've had a crush on Ohm
since elementary school.

8
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,156
This love seems impossible,

9
00:01:16,703 --> 00:01:19,501
but I still had hope,

10
00:01:19,994 --> 00:01:21,586
no matter how many years pass by.

11
00:01:50,784 --> 00:01:53,378
However, our story finally ended,

12
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,514
because Ohm went out with Pam.

13
00:01:58,117 --> 00:01:59,596
They decided to study abroad together.

14
00:02:02,283 --> 00:02:05,320
But my life has to go on.

15
00:02:08,616 --> 00:02:10,334
I later moved to study in Bangkok,

16
00:02:10,574 --> 00:02:15,364
Hoping that I could fall in love
with someone.

17
00:02:22,615 --> 00:02:24,412
But I don't have any feeling toward any.

18
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:26,945
Maybe,

19
00:02:28,573 --> 00:02:30,006
I'm still waiting for Ohm.

20
00:02:57,738 --> 00:02:58,375
Jane

21
00:02:59,196 --> 00:02:59,833
Jane

22
00:03:00,154 --> 00:03:02,952
Get out of your meditation.
Our shop is crowded.

23
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:10,327
What's going on, you two creatures?

24
00:03:10,612 --> 00:03:13,365
While you were meditating,

25
00:03:13,695 --> 00:03:16,971
did you see that

26
00:03:18,528 --> 00:03:22,282
the executive presiding
at the party tonight

27
00:03:23,444 --> 00:03:24,559
is damn...

28
00:03:25,777 --> 00:03:26,653
hot.

29
00:03:28,777 --> 00:03:29,448
Stop it.

30
00:03:31,235 --> 00:03:32,429
I'm in hibernate mode,

31
00:03:34,277 --> 00:03:35,266
on "male" diet.

32
00:03:37,777 --> 00:03:39,130
Here he comes.

33
00:03:43,443 --> 00:03:45,115
He's cool!

34
00:03:51,401 --> 00:03:52,550
Ohm.

35
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:54,944
I know this is ridiculous,

36
00:03:55,317 --> 00:03:58,514
but it's not anymore.

37
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:03,006
Now, he comes back to my life again.

38
00:04:05,025 --> 00:04:07,858
I've never imagined this moment before,

39
00:04:09,066 --> 00:04:10,419
but now it's real.

40
00:04:22,232 --> 00:04:23,221
Sa, right?

41
00:04:39,606 --> 00:04:42,882
I thought you still live in London.

42
00:04:44,064 --> 00:04:46,271
After I finished BA from Harvard.

43
00:04:46,272 --> 00:04:49,264
I went for MA at Oxford.

44
00:04:49,564 --> 00:04:52,078
Then I came back to Thailand.

45
00:04:52,647 --> 00:04:53,602
Urgent,

46
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:56,300
- and...
- And you're alone?

47
00:04:58,146 --> 00:04:59,135
Yes. I'm alone.

48
00:05:00,771 --> 00:05:03,729
I've just come back and
too busy to make new friend.

49
00:05:04,646 --> 00:05:05,556
I just arrived.

50
00:05:07,687 --> 00:05:09,325
Can I have your number?

51
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:35,771
If love is like waiting for a bus

52
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:38,741
I think it's worth every minute.

53
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,028
It may takes years,

54
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:44,927
but my bus arrives now.

55
00:05:47,185 --> 00:05:50,939
I'll get on this bus and begin my journey.

56
00:06:27,099 --> 00:06:30,091
"First Kiss"

57
00:06:45,848 --> 00:06:47,645
Focus on your work,
I'll call you later.

58
00:06:48,306 --> 00:06:48,977
Yes.

59
00:06:50,347 --> 00:06:51,541
Bye-bye.

60
00:07:02,471 --> 00:07:06,623
There is dog hair on your shirt.

61
00:07:07,888 --> 00:07:11,437
I told you this dog is losing hair
and you still wanted to hold it.

62
00:07:12,012 --> 00:07:12,683
Where?

63
00:07:13,304 --> 00:07:14,578
Over there.

64
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:17,990
Let me help.

65
00:07:22,928 --> 00:07:23,644
Kiss?

66
00:07:31,594 --> 00:07:32,583
Concentrate on your work.

67
00:07:34,178 --> 00:07:35,167
I'll give you a call.

68
00:07:35,844 --> 00:07:36,674
Go to work.

69
00:07:47,302 --> 00:07:50,453
When he dropped you off,

70
00:07:51,385 --> 00:07:52,579
I saw everything.

71
00:07:58,426 --> 00:08:00,144
Guilty as charged!

72
00:08:02,551 --> 00:08:05,425
Bitch! Slut!
You seduced him.

73
00:08:05,426 --> 00:08:05,967
True.

74
00:08:05,968 --> 00:08:07,174
But I like it.

75
00:08:07,175 --> 00:08:07,891
You slutty!

76
00:08:19,425 --> 00:08:24,101
You know first kiss is very important.

77
00:08:25,383 --> 00:08:29,979
It foresees the future
between you and your lover.

78
00:08:31,341 --> 00:08:35,459
I broke up with my ex-boyfriend
because of the first kiss.

79
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,479
His tongue is so big.

80
00:08:40,132 --> 00:08:42,168
When I pressed my lips with his,

81
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,513
his saliva was all over my mouth.

82
00:08:46,048 --> 00:08:48,926
It made me feels like
kissing a bulldog.

83
00:08:50,548 --> 00:08:52,778
The point is if your first kiss is good,

84
00:08:53,131 --> 00:08:56,421
it's possible that
your relation would went well.

85
00:08:56,422 --> 00:08:57,377
That's right.

86
00:08:57,797 --> 00:08:58,593
Good luck.

87
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:00,279
Let's go to work.

88
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:09,660
I'm glad you're with me here
at Phu Thab Berg.

89
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:16,784
I'd love to be with you anywhere.

90
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:19,709
Sa...

91
00:09:20,504 --> 00:09:21,459
I love you.

92
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:39,749
Accident!

93
00:09:43,669 --> 00:09:46,502
I gave a signal.
Don't you see?

94
00:09:58,585 --> 00:10:00,860
You ruined my Phu Thab Berg.

95
00:10:03,584 --> 00:10:04,778
What Phu Thab Berg, auntie?

96
00:10:14,834 --> 00:10:15,630
What's wrong with you?

97
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:19,547
Pull over, I'll get off here.

98
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,639
We need to talk.

99
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:27,272
You punk.
Hope I never see your face again, psycho!

100
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:32,581
Stop, please!
I'll get off this stop.

101
00:10:32,582 --> 00:10:35,415
No passenger allow to leave
outside bus stop, auntie.

102
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,179
What did you?!

103
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:44,556
What did you call me?
A psycho?

104
00:10:44,998 --> 00:10:46,831
Do I really look psycho to you?

105
00:10:46,832 --> 00:10:47,790
You are the one who...

106
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:50,588
Hey, stop it!

107
00:10:52,373 --> 00:10:53,705
Shut up, you punk!

108
00:10:53,706 --> 00:10:54,900
...Kiss me.

109
00:10:55,623 --> 00:10:59,093
I didn't intend to kiss you.
I'm sorry.

110
00:10:59,622 --> 00:11:02,420
You didn't intend to?
Then, why do you say sorry?

111
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:05,577
I don't know.

112
00:11:05,664 --> 00:11:07,734
OK. That's my bad.

113
00:11:09,122 --> 00:11:10,555
But I didn't intend to do that.

114
00:11:11,205 --> 00:11:12,160
I did nothing.

115
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:16,084
Nothing?
Obviously, you kissed me.

116
00:11:17,871 --> 00:11:18,428
Quiet!

117
00:11:18,538 --> 00:11:19,812
We did have a kiss.

118
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:21,732
What else could I say?

119
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:25,299
You kissed me.
Kissed me. Kissed...

120
00:12:36,824 --> 00:12:37,779
Hi.

121
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:40,903
Excuse me.
Did you have my cellphone?

122
00:12:41,616 --> 00:12:42,324
Well...

123
00:12:42,325 --> 00:12:43,643
Why did you kiss me?

124
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,912
Why did you steal my phone?

125
00:12:58,448 --> 00:13:00,822
Why did you steal my cellphone,
you rascal?

126
00:13:00,823 --> 00:13:03,815
You threw it to me, remember?

127
00:13:04,031 --> 00:13:05,669
And then you ran away.

128
00:13:06,447 --> 00:13:09,086
How could I give it back to you?

129
00:13:10,614 --> 00:13:12,172
Whatever.

130
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:14,680
You better give it back to me now.

131
00:13:14,822 --> 00:13:15,572
No!

132
00:13:17,238 --> 00:13:20,112
You can't keep it.
It's mine!

133
00:13:20,113 --> 00:13:23,867
Yes, I can.
I'll keep it as a compensation,

134
00:13:24,363 --> 00:13:27,321
for you stole kiss me.

135
00:13:31,612 --> 00:13:35,819
You have to pay me a lot more,
if there were any compensation.

136
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,617
Because you stole my first kiss.

137
00:13:37,862 --> 00:13:38,419
What?

138
00:13:39,612 --> 00:13:41,250
Am I really your first kiss?

139
00:13:41,528 --> 00:13:43,200
How old are you?

140
00:13:44,611 --> 00:13:46,966
You asshole.

141
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:50,033
If you won't give my phone back,

142
00:13:50,194 --> 00:13:52,833
I'll meet you at you school and we'll see!

143
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:54,267
Anytime.

144
00:13:54,777 --> 00:13:59,009
If you can find out where I study,
then, see me there.

145
00:14:12,401 --> 00:14:14,596
Paramee with whatever surnames,

146
00:14:15,151 --> 00:14:17,745
Please come to the disciplinary office.

147
00:14:18,068 --> 00:14:20,502
Paramee with whatever surnames,

148
00:14:20,859 --> 00:14:23,498
Please come to the disciplinary office.

149
00:14:23,734 --> 00:14:24,530
What did you do?

150
00:14:25,609 --> 00:14:27,281
Trouble.

151
00:14:41,608 --> 00:14:43,232
Paramee Jindanin

152
00:14:43,233 --> 00:14:44,648

Paramee Opanunt

155
00:14:50,274 --> 00:14:51,548
What am I doing wrong?

156
00:14:53,315 --> 00:14:55,624
I've never been to the disciplinary office.

157
00:14:58,607 --> 00:15:00,040
I always submit my homework.

158
00:15:03,315 --> 00:15:04,270
What are you mourning for?

159
00:15:08,606 --> 00:15:09,322
Huh?

160
00:15:13,564 --> 00:15:14,713
That's him!

161
00:15:39,729 --> 00:15:40,684
Paramee...

162
00:15:42,229 --> 00:15:44,106
Do you steal her cellphone?

163
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:47,627
Yes, ma'am.

164
00:15:48,395 --> 00:15:51,512
I caught him but
he refused to give it back.

165
00:15:52,895 --> 00:15:54,886
Why did you do that?

166
00:15:55,186 --> 00:15:56,778
Indeed.

167
00:15:57,436 --> 00:16:01,111
I can't believe this kid dare stealing.

168
00:16:01,602 --> 00:16:03,320
You must give her phone back now.

169
00:16:15,476 --> 00:16:17,307
I got to say sorry for my student.

170
00:16:18,976 --> 00:16:19,692
Never mind.

171
00:16:20,643 --> 00:16:24,238
Paramee, for what you have done,

172
00:16:24,809 --> 00:16:26,083
you have to be punished.

173
00:16:42,808 --> 00:16:43,638
Come here.

174
00:16:50,682 --> 00:16:55,517
Ma'am.
I don't think you have to do this.

175
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:58,889
I already get my phone back.
Everything's intact.

176
00:16:58,890 --> 00:16:59,686
No.

177
00:17:00,598 --> 00:17:03,510
He should be punished
for what he has done,

178
00:17:04,432 --> 00:17:05,990
so he won't do it again.

179
00:17:29,097 --> 00:17:29,609
Well...

180
00:17:30,846 --> 00:17:32,598
Just sit and still hurt?

181
00:17:33,263 --> 00:17:36,539
Haven't you been punished
when you were young?

182
00:17:37,554 --> 00:17:40,990
Oh... you can't remember, right

183
00:17:41,554 --> 00:17:43,033
because it's a long long time ago.

184
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:45,696
Cut it off!
I'm not that old.

185
00:17:53,012 --> 00:17:53,603
Here.

186
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,779
What is it?
Herbal drug for old maid?

187
00:17:58,636 --> 00:17:59,512
You dog breath!

188
00:18:00,469 --> 00:18:01,265
Use it.

189
00:18:05,677 --> 00:18:08,430
Auntie, how do you know my name?

190
00:18:08,927 --> 00:18:09,803
And where I study?

191
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:14,853
Do you think I'm blind?

192
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,751
I just couldn't catch your last name.

193
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,592
By the way, stop calling me auntie!

194
00:18:20,593 --> 00:18:21,992
Then, what do you want me to call?

195
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,769
Call me sister Sa.

196
00:18:25,051 --> 00:18:27,849
Why I have to call you sister?

197
00:18:28,884 --> 00:18:30,033
Can I call you Miss Sa?

198
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:32,139
No!
Call me sister.

199
00:18:33,634 --> 00:18:34,862
I don't want to.

200
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,679
Between auntie Sa and Miss Sa,

201
00:18:40,592 --> 00:18:41,308
what do you prefer?

202
00:18:43,092 --> 00:18:44,764
All right! Miss Sa then!

203
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:47,461
- You're unbelievable, stupido!
- Bass.

204
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,630
My name is Bass.

205
00:19:07,548 --> 00:19:08,981
Hello, Ohm.

206
00:19:11,423 --> 00:19:12,333
Tomorrow?

207
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:14,659
I'm available.

208
00:19:18,381 --> 00:19:20,576
The Chinese restaurant on Sukhumvit?

209
00:19:21,214 --> 00:19:23,409
Yes, I remember that place.

210
00:19:44,588 --> 00:19:45,498
What are you doing here?

211
00:19:46,129 --> 00:19:47,642
What a small world?

212
00:19:48,879 --> 00:19:50,278
Are you sure?

213
00:19:50,712 --> 00:19:52,225
Such a coincidence.

214
00:19:59,337 --> 00:20:01,373
I'll come and get it. Punk!

215
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,136
Yes,

216
00:20:06,628 --> 00:20:07,617
I'll take care of it.

217
00:20:08,336 --> 00:20:09,052
Thank you.

218
00:20:28,001 --> 00:20:30,667
Sorry. It was my customer calling.

219
00:20:30,668 --> 00:20:32,898
What is this, Bass?
Why this restaurant?

220
00:20:33,334 --> 00:20:34,528
Don't you think it's too old?

221
00:20:35,626 --> 00:20:37,742
But I think it fits your face.

222
00:20:37,959 --> 00:20:38,709
How is it?

223
00:20:41,584 --> 00:20:43,859
Why you call us to this restaurant?

224
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,649
I want to celebrate.

225
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:50,973
I've just realized that luck is on my side.

226
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:58,451
Peanut tastes great
if you pick it with love.

227
00:21:09,999 --> 00:21:11,193
Thank you very much.

228
00:21:12,957 --> 00:21:13,673
Sa...

229
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:17,615
I'm so glad that we've met again.

230
00:21:32,205 --> 00:21:33,160
Garland?

231
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:57,468
Do you want it or not?

232
00:22:10,911 --> 00:22:14,460
I think you should go to your room.

233
00:22:15,203 --> 00:22:16,431
And I'll call you later.

234
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:18,869
All right.

235
00:22:20,744 --> 00:22:22,097
- Thanks, Ohm.
- Yes.

236
00:22:40,993 --> 00:22:42,472
Hey!
Garland, ma'am?

237
00:22:43,701 --> 00:22:44,895
It's you?

238
00:22:45,534 --> 00:22:47,013
Why you keep getting on my nerve?!

239
00:22:47,742 --> 00:22:49,573
- How much do you want?!
- Stop!

240
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:56,442
Someone like me money can't buy.

241
00:22:56,658 --> 00:22:58,250
So, what do you want?

242
00:22:59,033 --> 00:23:01,945
Tomorrow, meet me here at ten.

243
00:23:02,866 --> 00:23:04,618
And dress beautifully.

244
00:23:05,533 --> 00:23:08,206
You'll go to the cinema with me because...

245
00:23:10,532 --> 00:23:11,248
Are you crazy?

246
00:23:43,947 --> 00:23:44,982
What kind of dress?

247
00:23:45,738 --> 00:23:47,296
I said dress beautifully, didn't I?

248
00:23:49,238 --> 00:23:52,275
This is the best I can.

249
00:23:52,904 --> 00:23:56,863
The best dress for dating with you.

250
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:13,459
Look at that!
He's so cute.

251
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,673
Is he with his mom?

252
00:24:17,069 --> 00:24:19,219
No way.
They don't look alike.

253
00:24:19,861 --> 00:24:21,214
I don't think they're relative.

254
00:24:21,569 --> 00:24:24,208
What do you think?
His girlfriend?

255
00:24:24,527 --> 00:24:26,438
Gosh!
I'm sure she is his mother.

256
00:24:26,611 --> 00:24:30,206
- They might have been Art & Craft Center.
- I guess.

257
00:24:33,568 --> 00:24:36,799
That's why I told you to dress properly.

258
00:24:37,735 --> 00:24:38,690
Do you wanna change?

259
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:42,693
You'd better dress appropriate next time.

260
00:24:43,818 --> 00:24:47,527
Next time? There is no next time.
This is the only last time with you.

261
00:24:50,692 --> 00:24:53,684
- So cute!
- Shouldn't have come with his mom.

262
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,595
What? What are you doing, huh?

263
00:25:04,858 --> 00:25:07,418
I want to show you the trailer
before we enter a theater.

264
00:25:14,732 --> 00:25:15,482
Wait, darling.

265
00:25:20,274 --> 00:25:21,912
- This is better?
- Well, yes, it looks all right.

266
00:25:22,232 --> 00:25:24,063
- Let me help.
- Let's go.

267
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:25,399
Pam?

268
00:25:27,648 --> 00:25:28,524
What's wrong?

269
00:25:31,773 --> 00:25:32,523
Nothing

270
00:25:41,689 --> 00:25:43,247
I know Pam.

271
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,516
I see you date with her boyfriend,

272
00:25:47,355 --> 00:25:49,311
So I brought you here to see it by yourself.

273
00:25:51,772 --> 00:25:53,125
They are getting married.

274
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,509
Married?

275
00:26:17,353 --> 00:26:20,186
Ohm is getting married?
I can't believe.

276
00:26:20,978 --> 00:26:23,173
He seems really love you, Sa.

277
00:26:23,769 --> 00:26:25,964
Have you talked to him?

278
00:26:30,102 --> 00:26:32,013
Someone brings you this, Sa.

279
00:26:38,977 --> 00:26:41,093
Who sent it?
Damn cheesy.

280
00:26:41,352 --> 00:26:42,228
It's me.

281
00:26:52,643 --> 00:26:53,519
Who are you?

282
00:26:53,976 --> 00:26:55,694
- Go to lunch with me?
- Yes, sure!

283
00:27:02,309 --> 00:27:03,298
Follow me.

284
00:27:09,558 --> 00:27:10,149
Hey!

285
00:27:10,558 --> 00:27:13,516
Make sure that
they won't catch you, all right?

286
00:27:26,474 --> 00:27:27,350
You sneaky...

287
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,368
Bitch

288
00:27:33,181 --> 00:27:36,139
I've just seen you cry for Ohm,

289
00:27:36,973 --> 00:27:39,441
in a blink,

290
00:27:40,139 --> 00:27:41,891
you get a new one.

291
00:27:42,139 --> 00:27:44,209
- Food will be served at your table.
- Thank you.

292
00:27:44,597 --> 00:27:45,825
- Evil!
- Slut!

293
00:27:46,222 --> 00:27:46,813
Devil!

294
00:27:49,847 --> 00:27:52,042
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

295
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:55,067
Lady first.

296
00:27:57,638 --> 00:27:58,753
Here you are.

297
00:27:59,471 --> 00:28:00,381
Strong coffee.

298
00:28:03,971 --> 00:28:04,847
Hey, you!

299
00:28:06,346 --> 00:28:08,621
Why don't you introduce your friends?

300
00:28:12,887 --> 00:28:13,842
This is Jane and Mham.

301
00:28:14,345 --> 00:28:15,494
- Hello.
- Good to see you.

302
00:28:15,595 --> 00:28:16,948
My colleagues

303
00:28:17,137 --> 00:28:19,810
This is Bass.

304
00:28:20,345 --> 00:28:21,300
Bass?

305
00:28:22,137 --> 00:28:24,856
He is just a friend.
See him near by.

306
00:28:26,345 --> 00:28:27,460
Why didn't I discover him first?

307
00:28:29,803 --> 00:28:31,680
- You're Bass?
- Yes.

308
00:28:32,261 --> 00:28:33,410
Can I play?

309
00:28:33,969 --> 00:28:34,844
Well, yes.

310
00:28:34,845 --> 00:28:36,163
Stop it.

311
00:28:38,885 --> 00:28:40,426
Excuse me.

312
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:43,676
Give it to me. Over here.
Big wings indeed.

313
00:28:43,677 --> 00:28:44,666
Cock-a-hoop.

314
00:28:45,218 --> 00:28:46,287
- Let's eat!
- Thank you.

315
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:47,465
Thank you.

316
00:28:49,343 --> 00:28:50,412
Please.

317
00:28:52,218 --> 00:28:52,934
I want some.

318
00:29:02,967 --> 00:29:05,800
Wicked!
He doesn't let her pick up the phone.

319
00:29:14,383 --> 00:29:15,452
Great!

320
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,472
Don't even let her read his message.

321
00:29:23,383 --> 00:29:25,533
Can I ask?
Is that my phone?

322
00:29:29,632 --> 00:29:30,542
What are you doing?

323
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:33,500
Nothing.

324
00:29:33,965 --> 00:29:35,796
It's not necessary to get that.
It's nonsense.

325
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,170
Was that Ohm?

326
00:29:41,798 --> 00:29:43,072
She really makes me envy.

327
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:45,459
Why nobody fight for me?

328
00:29:47,256 --> 00:29:49,338
Look at you face...

329
00:29:49,339 --> 00:29:51,170
and decide why men would fight for you?

330
00:29:53,047 --> 00:29:55,766
Just ignore it.
Finish your food, okay?

331
00:29:57,172 --> 00:29:58,127
I gotta go now.

332
00:29:59,755 --> 00:30:00,665
Have something to do.

333
00:30:06,796 --> 00:30:08,912
Hey!
My cellphone is with him.

334
00:30:09,671 --> 00:30:10,547
Yes.

335
00:30:11,254 --> 00:30:12,482
He's gone.

336
00:30:14,504 --> 00:30:16,699
Don't act innocent,

337
00:30:17,254 --> 00:30:18,812
I know you lure him.

338
00:30:19,295 --> 00:30:21,684
So deep.

339
00:30:21,962 --> 00:30:23,128
Her scheme.

340
00:30:23,129 --> 00:30:24,687
Out of my league.

341
00:30:26,962 --> 00:30:31,035
They are just girls.
I'll hit on a woman like Khru Dao.

342
00:30:32,711 --> 00:30:33,507
Who is she?

343
00:30:35,961 --> 00:30:37,314
A new intern teacher.

344
00:30:49,627 --> 00:30:51,982
She resembles my mom.
That's my type.

345
00:31:06,959 --> 00:31:09,519
How come are you here?

346
00:31:26,124 --> 00:31:29,434
Hello. I'm Sa.
I'm a senior in high school.

347
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:38,546
Oh I mean grade 12/4

348
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,940
What did you say?
Senior?

349
00:31:41,957 --> 00:31:44,915
Se... Se... See you there!

350
00:31:46,081 --> 00:31:47,355
Is she study at our school?

351
00:31:47,665 --> 00:31:48,780
She doesn't look familiar.

352
00:31:49,456 --> 00:31:50,775
She looks too old.

353
00:31:51,664 --> 00:31:52,892
Look who's talking.

354
00:31:53,081 --> 00:31:55,356
I've nurtured my skin
since I was a kid.

355
00:31:56,914 --> 00:31:57,630
Damn!

356
00:31:59,705 --> 00:32:02,173
By the way,
I'm not familiar with her.

357
00:32:02,539 --> 00:32:03,938
How can you familiar?

358
00:32:04,747 --> 00:32:06,544
She's not studying in our school.

359
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:11,402
Actually, she's already got a job.

360
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,479
But I'm hitting on her.

361
00:32:15,288 --> 00:32:18,041
That's why she follows me here.

362
00:32:20,537 --> 00:32:21,572
You the man.

363
00:32:21,871 --> 00:32:23,702
See?
She's shy.

364
00:32:25,704 --> 00:32:27,036
You pretty face boy!

365
00:32:27,037 --> 00:32:30,393
Anyway, let me introduce,

366
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,348
Here is Sa.

367
00:32:33,328 --> 00:32:34,761
This is Win and Art, my friends.

368
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:35,859
Hello.

369
00:32:41,744 --> 00:32:44,868
Is he your uncle?
Why is he here?

370
00:32:44,869 --> 00:32:46,826
Does he help you steal things?

371
00:32:46,827 --> 00:32:47,862
How long have you been here?

372
00:32:48,786 --> 00:32:50,583
What?
What long?

373
00:32:51,327 --> 00:32:54,284
Pre-class assembly!
Go! Hurry!

374
00:32:54,285 --> 00:32:56,162
- Yes.
- Hurry.

375
00:32:56,535 --> 00:32:57,251
Run!

376
00:33:09,826 --> 00:33:11,578
Hey!
Get it back to me.

377
00:33:17,325 --> 00:33:18,360
Don't be so hurry.

378
00:33:20,075 --> 00:33:21,588
Since you are here,

379
00:33:23,117 --> 00:33:24,994
Let's have some fun.

380
00:33:27,283 --> 00:33:30,673
Back in high school,
have you ever broken school's rule?

381
00:33:33,908 --> 00:33:34,897
Do you wanna try?

382
00:33:37,824 --> 00:33:39,337
Well...

383
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:43,687
Let's start from bulling you.

384
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,093
All right!
Let see then.

385
00:33:59,281 --> 00:34:02,239
Sa... I'm sorry.

386
00:34:04,989 --> 00:34:06,468
You... die!

387
00:34:09,114 --> 00:34:11,867
Why did you hit me?

388
00:34:24,071 --> 00:34:26,426
Have you ever skipped class?

389
00:34:31,862 --> 00:34:32,897
What are you two doing?

390
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:34,393
Why don't you go to class?

391
00:34:34,904 --> 00:34:36,053
Where you think you're going?

392
00:34:38,403 --> 00:34:39,233
This way!
This way!

393
00:34:43,611 --> 00:34:44,930
Where are you going?

394
00:35:40,024 --> 00:35:42,538
I loved to spend time

395
00:35:43,566 --> 00:35:45,477
in science lab during free class.

396
00:35:48,232 --> 00:35:50,427
Why?

397
00:35:54,357 --> 00:35:57,872
I don't think
it's a good place for relax.

398
00:36:31,271 --> 00:36:33,182
- You're not afraid now?
- Acting.

399
00:36:37,645 --> 00:36:42,036
Where do you love to go
when you skip class?

400
00:36:42,937 --> 00:36:45,656
Mostly, I spent my time at music room.

401
00:36:46,603 --> 00:36:47,797
Practicing with my band.

402
00:36:49,186 --> 00:36:51,939
I don't wanna brag,

403
00:36:53,019 --> 00:36:55,249
but I'm a member of school band.

404
00:36:57,061 --> 00:36:58,176
Are there any band's fans?

405
00:36:59,727 --> 00:37:02,002
No, I just play for fun.

406
00:37:03,352 --> 00:37:04,910
Is that what you want to hear?

407
00:37:06,352 --> 00:37:12,621
Oh... poor little boy.

408
00:37:13,601 --> 00:37:16,638
If there's no one listen
to your song, tell me

409
00:37:17,143 --> 00:37:18,292
I'll go listen to it.

410
00:37:19,351 --> 00:37:20,151
Really?

411
00:37:23,392 --> 00:37:25,986
Oh, by the way...

412
00:37:26,684 --> 00:37:29,994
you haven't told me
why you liked a science lab

413
00:38:01,681 --> 00:38:03,353
I loved a science lab...

414
00:38:06,015 --> 00:38:08,210
because at my school,

415
00:38:09,181 --> 00:38:11,456
if you looked down from the lab's window,

416
00:38:13,556 --> 00:38:15,706
you saw the whole basketball court clearly.

417
00:38:30,138 --> 00:38:31,014
Paramee!

418
00:38:32,804 --> 00:38:33,998
Don't let me catch you.

419
00:38:39,096 --> 00:38:40,290
Are you hiding?

420
00:38:40,762 --> 00:38:41,797
You hiding from me?

421
00:38:46,887 --> 00:38:48,081
Where are they?

422
00:38:57,969 --> 00:38:59,004
Let's go!

423
00:38:59,178 --> 00:39:02,534
Paramee, don't let me catch you!

424
00:39:30,176 --> 00:39:31,370
Should be somewhere in there.

425
00:39:33,509 --> 00:39:34,259
Your wallet...

426
00:39:35,592 --> 00:39:38,632
you better look for it yourself.
I'll wait here.

427
00:39:38,633 --> 00:39:40,942
Hey, wait.
Will you come with me?

428
00:39:43,591 --> 00:39:44,626
No, I won't.

429
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:47,433
You go find it by yourself.

430
00:39:55,049 --> 00:39:55,765
Here.

431
00:40:00,132 --> 00:40:02,168
No matter what happens, don't call me.

432
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:06,685
At this moment you better call an exorcist.

433
00:40:41,838 --> 00:40:42,793
Did you find it?

434
00:40:44,796 --> 00:40:47,833
If you want me to find it quickly,
come and help.

435
00:40:48,254 --> 00:40:51,724
I thought you said you like science lab.

436
00:40:52,337 --> 00:40:55,932
I like watching view from my science lab,

437
00:40:56,295 --> 00:40:57,887
not here.

438
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:00,092
Don't you want to know

439
00:41:00,711 --> 00:41:03,305
looking from this lab's window,

440
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:05,447
what will you see?

441
00:41:28,834 --> 00:41:33,666
Would you love me
if you don't have anyone?

442
00:41:33,667 --> 00:41:37,708
Please open your heart for me

443
00:41:37,709 --> 00:41:45,901
I promise you with my life that
I won't let you down.

444
00:41:47,167 --> 00:41:51,415
Would you love me, please?

445
00:41:51,416 --> 00:41:55,998
I don't want to see anyone have you.

446
00:41:55,999 --> 00:42:03,679
How do I live without you beside me?

447
00:43:07,411 --> 00:43:09,641
I don't want to compare myself with Ohm.

448
00:43:11,869 --> 00:43:13,700
I just want you to forget him.

449
00:43:18,994 --> 00:43:19,904
Is that it?

450
00:43:20,827 --> 00:43:21,976
I want to be your boyfriend.

451
00:43:24,743 --> 00:43:26,938
I just want a chance to take care of you.

452
00:43:34,118 --> 00:43:36,492
Friend can take care of friend.

453
00:43:36,493 --> 00:43:37,846
I don't want to be just friend.

454
00:44:25,281 --> 00:44:29,672
Have I told you love is
like waiting for a bus?

455
00:44:30,531 --> 00:44:31,863
I've found that...

456
00:44:31,864 --> 00:44:33,616
it's not just about waiting.

457
00:44:34,364 --> 00:44:36,924
Also, I've learned that,

458
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:39,418
once the bus arrives,

459
00:44:39,947 --> 00:44:41,858
you have to decide if you get on it.

460
00:44:52,404 --> 00:44:55,362
You looks very blossom
since you were in love.

461
00:44:55,862 --> 00:44:58,012
Putting on makeup,

462
00:44:58,237 --> 00:44:59,875
do you want to compete
the beauty with me?

463
00:45:00,487 --> 00:45:02,603
She can't.
You are way ahead of.

464
00:45:03,487 --> 00:45:04,761
- Who is it?
- Ohm.

465
00:45:05,612 --> 00:45:06,328
Give me.

466
00:45:06,653 --> 00:45:07,483
Don't talk to him.

467
00:45:15,153 --> 00:45:16,268
Coffee, ma'am.

468
00:45:19,194 --> 00:45:20,104
Here it is!

469
00:45:30,485 --> 00:45:32,157
"Love you"

470
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:01,654
"Tutorial School"

471
00:46:05,691 --> 00:46:07,443
Drop off your younger brother?
That's sweet.

472
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:23,295
Would you love me, please?

473
00:46:39,147 --> 00:46:42,344
He forgets to bring his wallet.

474
00:46:54,688 --> 00:46:56,360
Ouch!
My eyelash!

475
00:47:20,478 --> 00:47:22,787
"Love me?"

476
00:47:28,936 --> 00:47:30,767
Sa... You old crone.

477
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:33,713
I know everything now.

478
00:47:34,769 --> 00:47:37,329
Bass's friend is my facebook's friend.

479
00:47:38,935 --> 00:47:41,688
I thought it's his old photo.

480
00:47:43,185 --> 00:47:43,935
Bass?

481
00:47:45,684 --> 00:47:48,039
Are you serious with this relation?

482
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:51,631
Well.
He's good in everything.

483
00:47:52,476 --> 00:47:56,469
What important is you two like him.

484
00:48:01,808 --> 00:48:05,390
No high school boy would
take any love seriously.

485
00:48:05,391 --> 00:48:06,790
This is serious.

486
00:48:07,475 --> 00:48:08,828
Though you don't care anything,

487
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:11,773
at least you think about moral.

488
00:48:12,058 --> 00:48:16,290
We're 26.
We should think about marriage.

489
00:48:17,057 --> 00:48:19,252
It takes many years
before your boyfriend graduates.

490
00:48:19,557 --> 00:48:22,389
Don't you think
he might meet a younger,

491
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:24,381
and prettier woman than you.

492
00:48:24,682 --> 00:48:27,594
It might takes 10 years
before he's ready for marriage.

493
00:48:28,473 --> 00:48:30,111
And 10 years from now,

494
00:48:31,473 --> 00:48:34,112
you womb might be
dysfunctional by then.

495
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:49,682
Come on. Let me help.

496
00:48:53,097 --> 00:48:56,169
Fine, if you don't need my help.

497
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:02,252
Now my friends know that
you are high school boy.

498
00:49:03,388 --> 00:49:04,343
So?

499
00:49:06,512 --> 00:49:07,786
They told me that,

500
00:49:10,762 --> 00:49:15,278
I should have thought more
about future and reality.

501
00:49:17,012 --> 00:49:18,206
What do you mean?

502
00:49:21,678 --> 00:49:23,350
Our age gap is too wide.

503
00:49:24,595 --> 00:49:26,028
We think differently.

504
00:49:29,178 --> 00:49:33,217
How do we feel to each other,
I don't think

505
00:49:33,886 --> 00:49:36,764
it's enough to carry our relationship.

506
00:49:38,385 --> 00:49:40,899
Since you might not even,
think about our future.

507
00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:46,229
I guess we could make it together.

508
00:49:48,426 --> 00:49:51,862
I've thought about our future for a while.

509
00:49:56,467 --> 00:49:58,025
Our future is,

510
00:49:59,467 --> 00:50:03,619
when I graduate,
I will take over my dad's business.

511
00:50:05,675 --> 00:50:07,393
Then we'll getting married.

512
00:50:08,592 --> 00:50:12,551
We'll have two children.

513
00:50:17,091 --> 00:50:20,925
By that time, I will be 28.

514
00:50:21,924 --> 00:50:25,519
You will be 36.

515
00:50:27,757 --> 00:50:29,987
But nobody will care about that
when the time's comes.

516
00:50:37,923 --> 00:50:38,753
Sa.

517
00:50:41,756 --> 00:50:45,351
Do you know, in my life,

518
00:50:46,256 --> 00:50:48,611
I've chosen everything by myself.

519
00:50:51,422 --> 00:50:55,461
It's just a few thing that I couldn't.

520
00:50:57,255 --> 00:50:58,927
I couldn't choose my birthday.

521
00:51:01,463 --> 00:51:03,135
But now I've chosen that,

522
00:51:05,255 --> 00:51:06,654
for the rest of my life,

523
00:51:08,796 --> 00:51:11,310
I will be with you forever.

524
00:51:12,879 --> 00:51:16,474
Every morning, before I go to work,

525
00:51:17,587 --> 00:51:20,943
I want you to tie a tie for me.

526
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:25,535
Why you crying?

527
00:51:27,086 --> 00:51:29,077
You don't like my planned future.

528
00:51:41,919 --> 00:51:42,749
Hey, Sa...

529
00:51:44,752 --> 00:51:46,743
Do you want to come in
and wash your face?

530
00:51:55,418 --> 00:51:56,294
Come on.

531
00:51:59,293 --> 00:52:00,043
Come.

532
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:20,330
Stop!

533
00:52:21,125 --> 00:52:22,524
What are you doing?

534
00:52:22,666 --> 00:52:26,022
- Want me to hit his head? Let go of me!
- Stop!

535
00:52:31,499 --> 00:52:33,888
Sa... this is my father.

536
00:52:42,748 --> 00:52:46,024
Hello, sir.
I'm sorry...

537
00:52:46,290 --> 00:52:49,362
for that extreme greeting.

538
00:52:51,331 --> 00:52:52,446
Who is this woman?

539
00:52:55,831 --> 00:52:56,661
She's my friend.

540
00:52:58,122 --> 00:52:59,475
Look all you have done!

541
00:53:00,289 --> 00:53:02,962
Someone called me
you went to practice with your band.

542
00:53:03,330 --> 00:53:05,366
Did I order you not to play music?

543
00:53:05,747 --> 00:53:08,341
You should stop misbehave
and hang out late.

544
00:53:08,746 --> 00:53:10,702
I won't live forever to teach you.

545
00:53:11,246 --> 00:53:14,204
- Go upstairs!
- I will but let me send my friend back home first.

546
00:53:41,328 --> 00:53:42,451
I'm all right.

547
00:53:42,452 --> 00:53:44,363
By the way, you were great.

548
00:53:44,911 --> 00:53:46,708
If nobody had stopped you,

549
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,594
my father should have been knocked down.

550
00:53:52,702 --> 00:53:54,340
Come on, let's go home.

551
00:53:55,077 --> 00:53:57,910
And don't bother to give me a ride back.

552
00:53:59,076 --> 00:54:00,031
Wait a minute.

553
00:54:01,035 --> 00:54:05,028
Don't tell me that your?

554
00:54:18,283 --> 00:54:21,320
No need.

555
00:54:22,450 --> 00:54:25,328
I'll get some more when I go back.

556
00:54:25,825 --> 00:54:27,224
I'm going to do it once at a time.

557
00:54:29,866 --> 00:54:33,620
Why did your dad do this to you?

558
00:54:36,699 --> 00:54:38,576
He always mad at me since my mom died.

559
00:54:38,824 --> 00:54:40,416
Every activities I can do
when my mom's alive,

560
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:43,924
I couldn't do any now.

561
00:54:45,032 --> 00:54:46,750
My dad only wants me to stay home.

562
00:54:48,365 --> 00:54:49,878
But while I was there,

563
00:54:51,115 --> 00:54:52,753
he always be with another woman.

564
00:54:54,031 --> 00:54:55,623
That's why I go out
and practice music with my band.

565
00:54:57,364 --> 00:55:01,073
Somebody had asked
my band to play in the pub.

566
00:55:02,739 --> 00:55:04,934
Can you?
I think you are underage for such place.

567
00:55:05,489 --> 00:55:06,205
Well...

568
00:55:07,613 --> 00:55:08,932
What about your dad?

569
00:55:10,072 --> 00:55:11,824
Age is not a problem.

570
00:55:12,530 --> 00:55:13,599
But my dad...

571
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:17,055
Forget it.
For him, I always do things wrong.

572
00:55:20,238 --> 00:55:22,194
I have to go.

573
00:55:25,279 --> 00:55:26,507
He has been waiting for too long.

574
00:56:02,943 --> 00:56:03,819
Bass!

575
00:56:27,775 --> 00:56:28,810
Nice place.

576
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:40,987
Who are they?!

577
00:56:44,732 --> 00:56:45,926
My brothers.

578
00:56:46,815 --> 00:56:47,770
Tle and Tik,

579
00:56:48,898 --> 00:56:50,377
The turbulence twin.

580
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:55,536
They do nothing but arguing
who was born before.

581
00:56:59,773 --> 00:57:00,569
Sit here.

582
00:57:02,106 --> 00:57:03,221
I'll give you bandage.

583
00:57:10,189 --> 00:57:12,464
Live by yourself, aren't you feel lonely?

584
00:57:24,354 --> 00:57:29,030
How can you go to school in this condition?

585
00:57:32,937 --> 00:57:36,373
I think you'd better rest here.

586
00:57:37,937 --> 00:57:40,576
If you are hungry,

587
00:57:41,478 --> 00:57:42,911
there are foods in the fridge.

588
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,670
And in the evening,

589
00:57:51,269 --> 00:57:52,384
I'll cook for you.

590
00:57:55,602 --> 00:57:56,318
Here.

591
00:59:25,221 --> 00:59:26,051
Is it good?

592
00:59:27,555 --> 00:59:30,388
Do you want a lie or a truth?

593
00:59:45,053 --> 00:59:46,122
Listen...

594
00:59:47,637 --> 00:59:50,310
You ran away from home like this.
Where will you stay?

595
00:59:50,678 --> 00:59:51,872
Can I stay here?

596
00:59:53,553 --> 00:59:56,431
Please... just for a while.

597
00:59:57,219 --> 00:59:59,050
I'll move out when
I can find a new place.

598
01:00:01,802 --> 01:00:04,999
- Please, please, please.
- All right.

599
01:00:05,927 --> 01:00:07,121
Then...

600
01:00:10,135 --> 01:00:11,250
Go take a shower,

601
01:00:11,843 --> 01:00:14,311
I'll prepare the bed for you.

602
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:48,708
Hey, go to bed.

603
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:52,461
- You have to go to school tomorrow.
- I haven't done my homework yet.

604
01:01:52,462 --> 01:01:53,178
What?

605
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:56,288
Pervert!

606
01:01:56,753 --> 01:01:57,868
What's pervert?

607
01:01:59,295 --> 01:02:02,765
I meant homework as a school assignment.

608
01:02:03,711 --> 01:02:04,826
What do you think it is?

609
01:02:05,252 --> 01:02:08,688
Well... homework as it is.

610
01:02:09,502 --> 01:02:11,538
All right. Forget it.

611
01:02:12,835 --> 01:02:14,507
Come on. What subject?
Let me help.

612
01:02:33,251 --> 01:02:35,128
What is that?

613
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:38,365
Not so smart now?

614
01:02:41,125 --> 01:02:42,114
It's the 'Diff'

615
01:02:43,250 --> 01:02:43,966
Diff?

616
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:46,376
What's Diff?

617
01:02:47,208 --> 01:02:49,927
Is it like 'Dib Boyscout' the singer?

618
01:02:52,999 --> 01:02:53,749
Who's he?

619
01:02:56,457 --> 01:02:58,493
It's Diff Integration.

620
01:02:58,874 --> 01:03:01,342
It's Calculus.
It goes like this.

621
01:03:06,290 --> 01:03:07,166
Get it?

622
01:03:09,832 --> 01:03:11,982
How could you be this stupid?

623
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:15,333
I studied language arts, not maths.

624
01:03:16,873 --> 01:03:17,828
Don't make an excuse.

625
01:03:18,664 --> 01:03:21,178
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

626
01:03:21,372 --> 01:03:25,968
You're just a kid!
Show me some respect!

627
01:03:27,789 --> 01:03:31,099
How could you mess up my head?

628
01:03:48,912 --> 01:03:51,745
You should go sleep in your bed.

629
01:04:45,409 --> 01:04:47,240
What key did you give to the boy?

630
01:04:50,158 --> 01:04:52,035
My room's key

631
01:04:53,283 --> 01:04:56,400
You did it with the boy, didn't you?

632
01:04:57,574 --> 01:05:00,168
You're now immortal!

633
01:05:00,616 --> 01:05:02,095
Are you nuts? Huh?

634
01:05:02,574 --> 01:05:04,724
He's running away from home.

635
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:07,434
You invite him to stay with you?

636
01:05:08,490 --> 01:05:10,606
You're such a big bad bitch!

637
01:05:11,615 --> 01:05:13,173
You're ruining his future.

638
01:05:13,490 --> 01:05:16,004
Nonsense!
I'm not ruining his future.

639
01:05:16,906 --> 01:05:20,137
We are actually planning
our future together.

640
01:05:21,156 --> 01:05:22,589
When he graduates...

641
01:05:23,281 --> 01:05:25,317
He'll take over the family business.

642
01:05:25,531 --> 01:05:28,762
Then, we'll get married.

643
01:05:29,822 --> 01:05:31,574
- Come here.
- Wait!

644
01:05:32,364 --> 01:05:35,083
If he's going to take over
the family business,

645
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:37,350
how come he's staying
in your apartment?

646
01:05:37,613 --> 01:05:38,602
What's your logic?

647
01:05:38,863 --> 01:05:42,299
Sa, I think you should reconcile with Ohm.

648
01:05:44,071 --> 01:05:45,060
He's a married man.

649
01:05:45,363 --> 01:05:46,955
Not that he can't get divorced.

650
01:05:48,488 --> 01:05:50,319
But the age gap of almost 10 years...

651
01:05:50,904 --> 01:05:53,320
can't be reduced to a couple of years

652
01:05:53,321 --> 01:05:55,755
Can't you just keep
your feet on the ground?

653
01:05:56,362 --> 01:05:58,751
A high school kid dreams
as big as he can.

654
01:05:59,404 --> 01:06:01,440
You guys live in two different worlds.

655
01:06:17,736 --> 01:06:19,772
Whoa, I'm starving.

656
01:06:34,443 --> 01:06:35,432
Are you all right?

657
01:06:37,776 --> 01:06:39,448
How's your work today?

658
01:06:45,317 --> 01:06:49,993
Meeting with the client today
made me so exhausted.

659
01:06:50,484 --> 01:06:52,281
They changed the plan
again and again.

660
01:06:52,608 --> 01:06:56,078
When I said I couldn't finish it
by the last quarter.

661
01:06:56,566 --> 01:06:58,065
My boss simply told me

662
01:06:58,066 --> 01:06:59,545
find a subcontract to beat the deadline.

663
01:07:01,441 --> 01:07:03,397
If I can't carry out this project,

664
01:07:04,066 --> 01:07:06,261
I won't get bonus this year.

665
01:07:07,399 --> 01:07:08,718
What should I do?

666
01:07:11,316 --> 01:07:12,305
Seriously...

667
01:07:13,482 --> 01:07:14,915
What is 'the last quarter'?

668
01:07:30,064 --> 01:07:34,103
Well, now that you're escaping home...

669
01:07:34,939 --> 01:07:36,008
What did your dad say?

670
01:07:37,272 --> 01:07:38,341
He doesn't know it yet.

671
01:07:39,355 --> 01:07:42,825
For how long do you expect?

672
01:07:43,397 --> 01:07:45,149
- I'm not going back.
- What?

673
01:07:45,772 --> 01:07:47,808
But don't worry about my future plan,

674
01:07:48,813 --> 01:07:50,007
I have plan B.

675
01:07:51,355 --> 01:07:53,789
I'll work as a pub musician.

676
01:07:54,688 --> 01:07:57,441
Totally, 5,000-6,000 baht a month.

677
01:07:58,646 --> 01:08:00,318
I'll be able to feed you well.

678
01:08:00,979 --> 01:08:01,729
Right.

679
01:08:05,562 --> 01:08:08,394
Yes, meeting is set
at 10 o'clock tomorrow.

680
01:08:08,395 --> 01:08:09,894
Wait a sec. Sorry.

681
01:08:09,895 --> 01:08:11,613
Hello?
Yes. Wait a moment please.

682
01:08:13,186 --> 01:08:15,905
Excuse me?
All right, I've found it.

683
01:08:16,186 --> 01:08:18,222
Of course, I can do it.

684
01:08:20,478 --> 01:08:23,276
How can I possibly finish all the work?

685
01:08:24,019 --> 01:08:25,657
Hire some freelance to do the work.

686
01:08:28,394 --> 01:08:32,751
I think subcontracting is worth investment.

687
01:08:33,310 --> 01:08:36,825
And you'd be able to wrap up the project
before last quarter deadline.

688
01:08:37,476 --> 01:08:38,352
What would you say?

689
01:08:38,768 --> 01:08:40,360
Want me to find you a contact list?

690
01:08:42,184 --> 01:08:42,900
Ohm

691
01:08:45,393 --> 01:08:47,509
I already solved my problem.

692
01:08:48,517 --> 01:08:51,873
From now on, I can take care of you.

693
01:08:54,975 --> 01:08:56,613
You've come back to me...

694
01:08:57,725 --> 01:08:59,238
Wouldn't Pam mind at all?

695
01:09:00,475 --> 01:09:01,544
She doesn't care about me.

696
01:09:03,016 --> 01:09:04,415
We get married

697
01:09:05,766 --> 01:09:07,802
because she's pregnant and left alone.

698
01:09:10,724 --> 01:09:11,998
We don't really love each other.

699
01:09:12,141 --> 01:09:14,052
The one I do love...

700
01:09:17,974 --> 01:09:18,645
...is you.

701
01:09:25,682 --> 01:09:29,675
Although I'm with Pam,

702
01:09:32,140 --> 01:09:33,334
I always think about you.

703
01:09:36,264 --> 01:09:39,017
Pam and I don't get along well

704
01:09:42,222 --> 01:09:46,693
I think we fit together so well.

705
01:09:48,347 --> 01:09:49,336
Don't you think so?

706
01:10:07,221 --> 01:10:11,658
"Ohm is back"

707
01:10:45,135 --> 01:10:46,693
Can I stay with you for a while?

708
01:10:48,551 --> 01:10:49,586
All right.

709
01:10:51,509 --> 01:10:53,739
But don't let your dad know
where you are.

710
01:10:54,426 --> 01:10:57,883
I saw your dad's henchmen the other day.

711
01:10:57,884 --> 01:11:00,921
They looked like bandits.
I'm scared for you.

712
01:11:01,259 --> 01:11:04,092
I don't think you can escape this time, Bass.

713
01:11:05,342 --> 01:11:06,980
My dad is forcing me to study abroad.

714
01:11:11,425 --> 01:11:12,938
You'd better keep a low profile.

715
01:11:13,049 --> 01:11:14,402
Don't wander off for a while.

716
01:11:18,007 --> 01:11:20,131
Got your fake ID card yet?

717
01:11:20,132 --> 01:11:21,881
I've got mine.

718
01:11:21,882 --> 01:11:24,157
So that we can play a gig at that pub.
Got yours?

719
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:26,353
They told me I didn't need one.

720
01:11:27,382 --> 01:11:29,338
Believe me, you can blend in easily.

721
01:11:30,048 --> 01:11:32,164
- With a face like me?
- It'll be a breeze.

722
01:11:32,590 --> 01:11:34,660
I look so young.
How could I pass?

723
01:11:35,048 --> 01:11:35,844
Are you crazy?

724
01:11:40,714 --> 01:11:41,783
Ohm is back.

725
01:11:42,256 --> 01:11:43,166
I knew it!

726
01:11:43,797 --> 01:11:45,276
By the way, who's Ohm?

727
01:11:46,464 --> 01:11:47,214
Right.

728
01:11:49,339 --> 01:11:51,807
He's my girlfriend's ex-boyfriend.

729
01:11:52,380 --> 01:11:53,495
And he's her first love.

730
01:11:55,713 --> 01:11:58,511
So?
You're a hotshot.

731
01:11:58,755 --> 01:12:02,304
Although your dad...
constantly beats you up.

732
01:12:02,505 --> 01:12:04,063
- How come is he better than you?
- Right.

733
01:12:04,754 --> 01:12:06,312
He's got a house...
a car...

734
01:12:06,671 --> 01:12:09,424
and a high paying permanent job.

735
01:12:10,171 --> 01:12:11,126
I'll go for Ohm.

736
01:13:07,167 --> 01:13:09,123
Come on. Come on.

737
01:13:09,333 --> 01:13:13,929
"Incoming Call - Bass"

738
01:13:35,540 --> 01:13:38,850
Oh, god!
The clash of boyfriends!

739
01:13:39,581 --> 01:13:41,776
The doomsday is falling on us, Mham.

740
01:13:43,748 --> 01:13:46,038
We should flee right now.

741
01:13:46,039 --> 01:13:47,154
Let's go.

742
01:13:51,414 --> 01:13:52,608
Hey, Jane... Mham

743
01:13:53,664 --> 01:13:56,303
- Hi, Ohm.
- Hi there.

744
01:13:57,247 --> 01:14:01,704
Is Sa here?
I've been calling her several times.

745
01:14:01,705 --> 01:14:03,263
She doesn't answer the phone.

746
01:14:04,455 --> 01:14:07,094
She said she'd be out running
some errands.

747
01:14:07,913 --> 01:14:10,063
- She might not come back today.
- That's right.

748
01:14:10,246 --> 01:14:12,202
You shouldn't wait.
It's a waste of time.

749
01:14:12,704 --> 01:14:17,286
I'm bringing her the freelance contact list.

750
01:14:17,287 --> 01:14:18,785
Here it is.
Please give it to her.

751
01:14:18,786 --> 01:14:19,458
Sure.

752
01:14:20,537 --> 01:14:23,768
Splendid.
She's using her ex-boyfriend.

753
01:14:24,537 --> 01:14:27,654
You have any plans
for your next vacation?

754
01:14:28,037 --> 01:14:29,311
No, we haven't.

755
01:14:29,411 --> 01:14:32,164
Good.
I've booked a hotel package in Phuket.

756
01:14:32,411 --> 01:14:35,926
I'm taking Sa and
her family on a vacation.

757
01:14:36,328 --> 01:14:38,702
If you don't have any plan, join us.

758
01:14:38,703 --> 01:14:40,500
Well, I...
Thank you.

759
01:14:40,702 --> 01:14:41,930
I think you'd better go.

760
01:14:42,744 --> 01:14:44,416
Or rush into the emergency room.

761
01:14:44,994 --> 01:14:46,712
Be smacked by the boy.

762
01:14:48,452 --> 01:14:49,646
You'd better go.

763
01:14:50,035 --> 01:14:51,659
Please handle that for me.

764
01:14:51,660 --> 01:14:52,868
- I will.
- Sure.

765
01:14:52,869 --> 01:14:55,143
- Thank you very much.
- Bye bye.

766
01:15:02,243 --> 01:15:04,962
That's it.
There he goes.

767
01:15:05,326 --> 01:15:07,681
We'll bring you a sympathy gift basket, Ohm.

768
01:15:15,617 --> 01:15:16,333
Thank you.

769
01:15:28,241 --> 01:15:28,878
Thank you.

770
01:15:34,032 --> 01:15:34,748
Hey, Bass.

771
01:15:35,157 --> 01:15:37,068
She couldn't find you at the school.

772
01:15:37,365 --> 01:15:38,559
So she's been waiting for you here.

773
01:15:45,740 --> 01:15:46,934
Why didn't you go to school?

774
01:15:47,365 --> 01:15:49,925
You could be expelled for skipping school.

775
01:15:57,364 --> 01:15:58,080
Hey...

776
01:15:58,739 --> 01:15:59,694
Hey, look.

777
01:16:00,072 --> 01:16:02,984
I bought a maths books today.

778
01:16:03,489 --> 01:16:05,684
So you would stop calling me stupid.

779
01:16:06,697 --> 01:16:08,096
Let's see what it's all about.

780
01:16:10,821 --> 01:16:14,052
Here!
Calculus... Integration.

781
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:15,679
Probability... Oh?

782
01:16:18,738 --> 01:16:19,966
Do you have a lot of free time?

783
01:16:21,821 --> 01:16:23,573
You don't have to try this hard.

784
01:16:25,487 --> 01:16:27,876
No need to understand what you don't.

785
01:16:28,487 --> 01:16:30,944
I won't try to understand...

786
01:16:30,945 --> 01:16:32,901
what 'last quarter' is either.

787
01:16:36,445 --> 01:16:39,403
But I...
I finished the first chapter.

788
01:16:41,028 --> 01:16:44,259
And now I can solve this kind of equation.

789
01:16:46,069 --> 01:16:47,985
- Hey!
- Huh? What?

790
01:16:47,986 --> 01:16:49,385
What song are we going to play?

791
01:16:50,402 --> 01:16:51,755
Ah... well...

792
01:16:52,527 --> 01:16:54,276
I told you that the rich boy...

793
01:16:54,277 --> 01:16:55,358
...is damn self-willed.

794
01:16:55,359 --> 01:16:56,236
You'd better go back.

795
01:18:06,730 --> 01:18:09,085
"You are my love - Ohm"

796
01:18:40,645 --> 01:18:41,521
Ohm?

797
01:18:46,478 --> 01:18:49,709
Wise choice that you are now dating Ohm.

798
01:18:52,186 --> 01:18:53,824
Sorry, I'm late.

799
01:18:54,102 --> 01:18:55,501
I have an urgent thing to do.

800
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:07,118
She doesn't care about her baby.

801
01:19:07,935 --> 01:19:09,573
I took pity on this little one.

802
01:19:10,768 --> 01:19:12,520
So I'm taking care of him for now.

803
01:19:13,476 --> 01:19:16,195
Well, you're such a good guy.

804
01:19:16,976 --> 01:19:20,764
So much love for women,
children, and everyone.

805
01:19:21,309 --> 01:19:22,662
So much, very much!

806
01:19:23,392 --> 01:19:25,269
You two might have a long conversation.

807
01:19:26,017 --> 01:19:29,805
We will take care of your baby.

808
01:19:30,350 --> 01:19:32,682
- It'd be better.
- Come with me, sweety.

809
01:19:32,683 --> 01:19:33,957
Please take care of her.

810
01:19:35,516 --> 01:19:36,995
How cute!

811
01:19:38,558 --> 01:19:39,388
Here.

812
01:19:48,099 --> 01:19:48,895
Sa...

813
01:19:50,807 --> 01:19:52,081
You wouldn't mind, would you?

814
01:19:54,223 --> 01:19:55,053
Not at all.

815
01:20:09,889 --> 01:20:10,799
Ohm...

816
01:20:13,722 --> 01:20:14,472
Pam

817
01:20:15,930 --> 01:20:16,885
Where are you?

818
01:20:18,347 --> 01:20:21,464
You sound so drunk.
Where are you?

819
01:20:23,305 --> 01:20:25,102
Park right there.
Don't drive.

820
01:20:26,096 --> 01:20:27,245
I'll pick you up in an hour.

821
01:20:28,554 --> 01:20:29,430
Just park right there.

822
01:20:34,096 --> 01:20:36,656
Sa, let's order some food.

823
01:20:41,970 --> 01:20:44,803
- Don't you have to pick...
- Order some food.

824
01:20:52,511 --> 01:20:55,389
Well... I'd like to...

825
01:20:56,552 --> 01:21:01,068
thank you for bringing me the contact list.

826
01:21:04,594 --> 01:21:05,344
Pardon me?

827
01:21:08,177 --> 01:21:09,166
I said...

828
01:21:09,427 --> 01:21:12,976
thank you for bringing me the contact list.

829
01:21:13,510 --> 01:21:18,538
Jen and Mham would love
to join our trip to Phuket.

830
01:21:21,342 --> 01:21:22,616
That's all right.

831
01:21:23,634 --> 01:21:25,943
Good. Good.
The more, the merrier.

832
01:21:30,717 --> 01:21:32,275
You'd better go seeing Pam.

833
01:21:48,549 --> 01:21:52,258
Sa, today is all about you.

834
01:21:53,507 --> 01:21:54,462
But all

835
01:21:55,924 --> 01:21:58,199
You are thinking of is Pam, right?

836
01:22:02,465 --> 01:22:03,295
Sa...

837
01:22:03,881 --> 01:22:04,950
I understand.

838
01:22:07,964 --> 01:22:09,238
It happens to me as well.

839
01:22:13,047 --> 01:22:16,562
I'm trying to be with you.

840
01:22:17,672 --> 01:22:19,230
But what really happens is that...

841
01:22:19,589 --> 01:22:21,739
All the time that we're sitting here,

842
01:22:22,088 --> 01:22:24,158
my mind is on someone else.

843
01:22:26,297 --> 01:22:28,015
I think we feel the same thing.

844
01:22:29,796 --> 01:22:31,212
We thought it's wiser

845
01:22:31,213 --> 01:22:33,204
to be with someone in a league of our own.

846
01:22:34,588 --> 01:22:35,782
But what really happens...

847
01:22:38,129 --> 01:22:40,882
What we are doing is against our hearts.

848
01:22:54,961 --> 01:22:55,950
Sa...

849
01:23:00,378 --> 01:23:01,413
Thank you.

850
01:23:16,668 --> 01:23:19,341
Hey, Sa.
Are you going to work?

851
01:23:19,960 --> 01:23:23,270
- I'll give you a ride.
- That's OK. I can go to work myself.

852
01:23:23,959 --> 01:23:25,153
Come on, Sa.

853
01:23:25,709 --> 01:23:28,064
Think of it as a ride with a brother.

854
01:23:31,251 --> 01:23:34,323
I want to thank you for understanding me.

855
01:23:35,125 --> 01:23:38,162
You made me realize
what I really need to do.

856
01:23:42,791 --> 01:23:44,463
To show you how grateful I am,

857
01:23:45,166 --> 01:23:46,485
I'll take you out for a treat tonight.

858
01:23:47,624 --> 01:23:50,218
Invite as many friends as you'd like.

859
01:23:51,624 --> 01:23:52,261
All right?

860
01:24:42,413 --> 01:24:44,005
Hello, everyone!

861
01:24:44,204 --> 01:24:46,354
All single ladies, put your hands up!

862
01:24:48,287 --> 01:24:50,562
Did anyone here sneak out from boyfriend?

863
01:24:51,995 --> 01:24:54,384
All single and not-so-single ladies,

864
01:24:54,703 --> 01:24:58,252
On this special night, we'll have a fun activity.
We're gonna have...

865
01:24:58,703 --> 01:25:01,979
An auction for a kiss with our hot singer!

866
01:25:05,994 --> 01:25:08,462
Give me some noise!

867
01:25:16,785 --> 01:25:19,140
Even a frog like him
can make girls scream.

868
01:25:19,577 --> 01:25:22,410
If they put my kiss on an auction,
girls will go gaga over it.

869
01:25:23,326 --> 01:25:24,042
Right.

870
01:25:24,535 --> 01:25:26,491
I can't imagine that day.

871
01:25:26,951 --> 01:25:29,784
Whoo!
Look yummy!

872
01:25:30,493 --> 01:25:32,961
Watch me.
His kiss must be mine.

873
01:25:34,742 --> 01:25:37,210
First bid... 500 baht!

874
01:25:37,534 --> 01:25:40,574
Wow, haven't started bidding yet
but we already got 500.

875
01:25:40,575 --> 01:25:42,531
Do I hear a higher bid?

876
01:25:42,908 --> 01:25:43,784
800!

877
01:25:44,325 --> 01:25:45,155
1,000!

878
01:25:45,658 --> 01:25:47,091
2,000!

879
01:25:49,158 --> 01:25:52,673
Jane, don't you think 2,000 baht
is too expensive?

880
01:25:52,908 --> 01:25:54,182
- C'mon.
- Just sit there.

881
01:25:54,324 --> 01:25:55,234
I want him.

882
01:25:55,616 --> 01:25:56,492
5,000!

883
01:26:04,907 --> 01:26:06,977
Ready to drop the hammer
and announce that I win?

884
01:26:09,740 --> 01:26:11,492
Sa, can I borrow your money?

885
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:12,956
Jane...

886
01:26:14,990 --> 01:26:15,706
Take this.

887
01:26:16,406 --> 01:26:17,395
Thank you, Ohm.

888
01:26:20,656 --> 01:26:22,488
5,500 baht!

889
01:26:22,489 --> 01:26:25,287
5,500 baht, going once.

890
01:26:26,114 --> 01:26:29,186
5,500 baht, going twice.

891
01:26:29,655 --> 01:26:30,644
And...

892
01:26:31,364 --> 01:26:32,274
And...

893
01:26:32,364 --> 01:26:35,720
5,500 baht... Sold!

894
01:26:38,738 --> 01:26:40,888
To Table R3!

895
01:26:43,863 --> 01:26:45,694
Well, excuse me.

896
01:26:45,863 --> 01:26:48,935
I have my own rule to kiss only real girls.

897
01:26:51,196 --> 01:26:52,595
We won the auction.

898
01:26:52,862 --> 01:26:54,853
If I don't get the kiss,

899
01:26:55,154 --> 01:26:57,349
One of the girls at my table must get it.

900
01:26:59,987 --> 01:27:02,501
Sa, it's you.

901
01:27:03,112 --> 01:27:04,227
Go on.

902
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:07,985
- Hurry up, otherwise it'll be our lost.
- Yes, it's you.

903
01:27:07,986 --> 01:27:10,898
May the winner come up here.

904
01:27:11,819 --> 01:27:14,128
- Hurry up!
- Go on.

905
01:27:16,361 --> 01:27:18,158
Hurry up.
It's your chance. So cute.

906
01:27:19,694 --> 01:27:20,763
Go on.

907
01:27:21,277 --> 01:27:25,276
- Wow, if you're ready...
- Go on.

908
01:27:25,277 --> 01:27:27,401
Prepare to be kissed.

909
01:27:27,402 --> 01:27:29,150
- You guys!
- Sa!

910
01:27:29,151 --> 01:27:32,109
Have you ever cared to ask me first?

911
01:27:32,110 --> 01:27:34,275
Don't play hard to get.
Here's your chance.

912
01:27:34,276 --> 01:27:37,192
Come on!
Look, he's so handsome.

913
01:27:37,193 --> 01:27:38,441
Cute!

914
01:27:38,442 --> 01:27:43,641
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

915
01:28:29,231 --> 01:28:30,061
Bass

916
01:28:34,939 --> 01:28:36,657
- Let me kiss you instead.
- No, thank you.

917
01:28:51,938 --> 01:28:53,417
Bass! Bass!

918
01:29:01,312 --> 01:29:02,062
Ohm

919
01:29:06,562 --> 01:29:07,597
That kid...

920
01:29:08,978 --> 01:29:10,127
His father is Mr. Kriengkrai?

921
01:29:10,853 --> 01:29:13,845
Do you know Bass's father?

922
01:29:14,686 --> 01:29:15,801
Kriengkrai...

923
01:29:17,478 --> 01:29:18,797
is the father of Pam's baby.

924
01:29:32,727 --> 01:29:35,605
- I've got him.
- Get off me! Let me go!

925
01:29:39,309 --> 01:29:40,742
Get ready to go to the airport.

926
01:29:41,518 --> 01:29:43,748
All you care about is music
and your girlfriend.

927
01:29:44,309 --> 01:29:45,583
You need to learn a lesson.

928
01:29:46,184 --> 01:29:48,379
You need to stop acting like a lunatic.

929
01:29:54,142 --> 01:29:56,258
You don't want to see
your girl in trouble, do you?

930
01:30:22,765 --> 01:30:25,438
Sa... good luck.

931
01:30:27,306 --> 01:30:28,659
You too, Ohm.

932
01:30:49,638 --> 01:30:52,198
If love is like waiting for a bus.

933
01:30:56,304 --> 01:30:59,819
Sometimes even we catch the right one,

934
01:31:01,137 --> 01:31:03,207
it doesn't mean
we'd always have a smooth ride.

935
01:31:10,303 --> 01:31:14,899
- Pam!
- I used to feel reluctant to get on a bus.

936
01:31:15,970 --> 01:31:18,325
- But from now on, I won't be afraid of it.
- Leave me alone!

937
01:31:18,511 --> 01:31:19,227
Pam!

938
01:32:19,674 --> 01:32:22,188
And if that bus is going to run away from me,

939
01:32:22,715 --> 01:32:24,273
I'll run after it. Bass!

940
01:32:25,007 --> 01:32:27,043
Bass! Bass!

941
01:32:27,548 --> 01:32:29,504
Bass! Bass!

942
01:32:30,881 --> 01:32:31,870
Bass!

943
01:32:43,381 --> 01:32:44,370
Bass!

944
01:32:46,172 --> 01:32:46,968
Bass!

945
01:32:47,589 --> 01:32:48,385
Bass!

946
01:33:21,128 --> 01:33:22,243
Are you out of your mind?

947
01:33:23,086 --> 01:33:24,360
Why are you running after me?

948
01:33:37,877 --> 01:33:39,356
You told me once...

949
01:33:42,918 --> 01:33:45,671
You wanted to see me tying
your tie every morning.

950
01:33:50,001 --> 01:33:51,514
Don't you want to see it anymore?

951
01:34:18,999 --> 01:34:19,875
Bass!

952
01:34:24,874 --> 01:34:25,943
Bass!

953
01:34:30,998 --> 01:34:32,067
Bass!

954
01:35:18,329 --> 01:35:22,527
5 years later.

955
01:36:49,531 --> 01:36:50,361
Yes, Mom.

956
01:36:53,197 --> 01:36:54,755
Still have a headache, Mom.

957
01:36:56,822 --> 01:36:58,221
I'll go to bed soon.

958
01:37:03,738 --> 01:37:05,091
Tle and Tik?

959
01:37:06,530 --> 01:37:08,088
You don't have to send them over here.

960
01:37:09,488 --> 01:37:11,877
I can take care of myself.
I'm fine.

961
01:37:15,571 --> 01:37:17,050
I'm going to bed now.

962
01:37:17,904 --> 01:37:18,859
Bye bye.

963
01:39:03,647 --> 01:39:04,636
Yes, Mom.

964
01:39:04,980 --> 01:39:06,652
Have Tle and Tik arrived there yet?

965
01:39:13,605 --> 01:39:15,038
Tle and Tik?

966
01:39:15,771 --> 01:39:18,365
Yes, I send them to check you
out last night.

967
01:39:21,563 --> 01:39:22,393
Sa

968
01:39:22,937 --> 01:39:24,052
Do you hear me?

969
01:39:24,271 --> 01:39:27,270
Yes, Mom.

970
01:39:27,271 --> 01:39:28,894
Call me if you need anything.

971
01:39:28,895 --> 01:39:30,269
Thank you.

972
01:39:30,270 --> 01:39:31,498
Yes, dear.

973
01:43:33,046 --> 01:43:36,083
Please sign here, Mr. Janepob.

974
01:43:46,045 --> 01:43:47,034
Thank you.

975
01:43:48,670 --> 01:43:49,386
Wait.

976
01:43:50,253 --> 01:43:50,924
Yes?

977
01:43:53,919 --> 01:43:54,829
You're fired.

978
01:44:07,169 --> 01:44:08,363
My name is Jeannie.

979
01:44:09,252 --> 01:44:10,751
Dare to show off.

980
01:44:10,752 --> 01:44:12,231
Have you tucked and taped yet?
