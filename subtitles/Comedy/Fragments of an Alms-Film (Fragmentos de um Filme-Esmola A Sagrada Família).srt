1
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,830
A SERBIAN FILM

2
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,580
Baby, I'm gonna fuck you up!

3
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,210
Are you insane?

4
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,710
Haven't we agreed about
putting away your flicks?

5
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,220
What's that?
Give it to mommy.

6
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,390
Sorry, but it's
not a big deal.

7
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,810
I saw my first porn
when I was his age.

8
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,180
How are you, kiddo?

9
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:10,190
But your dad wasn't
starring in it!

10
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,530
Maria, I'm sorry
I didn't mean it.

11
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:17,700
I dug up that DVD because...

12
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,030
Laylah called and
wanted to see me today.

13
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,330
Baby, you want mommy
to make you a toast?

14
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,120
The jumping bread!

15
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:35,500
Mom, what was dad
doing there?

16
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:38,260
Nothing, hon.
Just playing with a girl friend.

17
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:41,470
It's like a cartoon
for the grownups.

18
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,670
Honey, I have to pay
for Petar's singing lessons.

19
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,210
Bye, dad.
- Bye, dad.

20
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:08,180
Easy on that whiskey.
Rye kills sexual appetite.

21
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,640
That's why I drink it.

22
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:21,780
So, how's family life?
- Nice.

23
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:25,160
How are Petar and... Maria?

24
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,830
Yes, Maria.
They're fine.

25
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,700
Next year Petar's
starting school.

26
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:34,750
It'll be interesting
when they ask about

27
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,500
his father's occupation.

28
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:41,210
His father is a fine gentleman
in a premature retirement.

29
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,430
The problem with that pension
is that it's not lifelong.

30
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:47,890
How much do you have
stashed? 5 or 10 grand?

31
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,850
Milos, you were more
than just a porn star

32
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,980
you were an artist.

33
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,650
All actresses you worked with
wanted to marry you.

34
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,740
You're still an artist,
but with a temporary block.

35
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:13,750
And I'm your guardian angel.
Listen.

36
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,960
Something big is about to
happen. Artistic pornography

37
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:21,500
of the highest level.
Here, in Serbia.

38
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,840
In Serbia? -Only filmed here,
but for the foreign market.

39
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:30,260
Terribly professional.
Phenomenally paid. If you accept

40
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:35,060
your family will be settled
till the end of Petar's life.

41
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:43,280
The man's name is Vukmir.
He'll call you in a few days.

42
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,690
Be nice to him.

43
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,950
Here's something for the junior.

44
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:58,920
Wow, where's his pussy?

45
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:02,710
You didn't tell me you brought
your copper bro to the meeting.

46
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,010
I came on my own. I knew you'd
be here and couldn't miss

47
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,140
a chance to see you.
I'm your great admirer.

48
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,730
You're well preserved.

49
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:29,360
Who's the plastic surgeon
we have to thank to?

50
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:34,080
You know I started early.
I don't need plastic yet.

51
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,330
Everybody needs it.

52
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,500
These don't

53
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:52,300
So long, fags.
Milos, you heard my advice.

54
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:59,810
A hooker!
- A porn star.

55
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,520
Has-been.

56
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:06,400
You know the kind of work
she did after you married?

57
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,150
I know.

58
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,530
No one could handle
a dick like she could.

59
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,450
A natural talent.

60
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,960
Funny she hasn't
contacted her dealer

61
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:21,960
in the past few years.

62
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:24,420
Is she off drugs?

63
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:30,590
Doubtful. A new,
rich provider, more likely.

64
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,550
You'll alienate me
from my friends

65
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,350
if you keep checking on them.

66
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,270
Friends, in Serbia?

67
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,310
You can't check them enough.

68
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,440
I gotta go.

69
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:51,320
Say hello to your kid
and his beautiful mom.

70
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,330
I'm paying for the bite.

71
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,870
So long.
- Bye.

72
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:31,530
Sleeping time, hands up.

73
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,320
Dad?
- Yes?

74
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,660
Know that friend of yours

75
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:39,240
that you were
beating in the video

76
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:44,330
It's only a movie. Make believe.
When dad was young.

77
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:47,460
I know, but while
I was watching it

78
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,750
I felt something
strange. - What?

79
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:54,170
Like some kind
of a wheel, spinning.

80
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:58,760
A wheel? Where?
- Down there, near my willie.

81
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,730
Several of them,
like a family, travelling.

82
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,360
Do they live in me?

83
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:12,650
They do, hon, in all of us.
We all have them.

84
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,860
Everyone in the world?
- Yes, everyone.

85
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:21,910
They're gone now,
so close your eyes

86
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,040
think of them and
you'll fall asleep faster.

87
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,430
What language is that?

88
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:41,680
I'm translating
for some Swedes.

89
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:44,350
Swedish? I'm great in it.

90
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:49,730
That's right.

91
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,190
Wait, I know more.
Listen to this.

92
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:05,580
You would be a mega star.

93
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:21,350
So, you say Laylah is
offering you a serious job?

94
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:24,970
So she said.
It's strange.

95
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,190
Why would anyone
offer me big money

96
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:33,020
after such a long pause?
In Serbia?

97
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,530
And after all the crap
I shot, look at this.

98
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:57,510
Maybe they need
the only porn star

99
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,590
a university diploma.

100
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,180
Do you miss it?

101
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,360
What?
- The job.

102
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,190
I don't know. No.

103
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:22,780
I miss the money so we could
escape away from here.

104
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:36,250
All those poor girls
you threw away like condoms...

105
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:42,550
How come you've never
done me like them?

106
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:49,600
Well, I love you.
I've just fucked them.

107
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:04,410
Does it mean that you
never wanted to fuck me?

108
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,150
<i>Am I talking to the
Balkan sex god.</i>

109
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,280
<i>Nikola Tesla of
world pornography?</i>

110
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,780
You must be Vukmir?

111
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,530
<i>Of course. Milos, if you're
ready to change your life</i>

112
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:13,160
<i>right now and provide
your family for good</i>

113
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:16,960
<i>a car will be waiting
at your door in 30 minutes.</i>

114
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:21,630
<i>You just hop in, and take
a ride towards fulfillment</i>

115
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:25,670
<i>of your personal and
my professional fantasies.</i>

116
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,720
<i>Can't wait to meet you!</i>

117
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:53,830
I'm honored to shake hands
to such an artist, I'm Vukmir.

118
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:55,910
I'm Milos, nice to meet you.

119
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:02,250
Right hand is the
sex center in any man,

120
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:07,630
It's direct line between
your brain and cock.

121
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:11,390
Ever since you childhood.

122
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,930
Your hand is special

123
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:18,310
for it has jerked
such a special cock.

124
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,600
Milos, it's an honor

125
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,770
to shake a hand
to such an artist of fuck.

126
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,280
Pornography is art,
but people can't see that!

127
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,200
Why not?

128
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:41,210
Because they just want
to jizz into a napkin

129
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:43,460
what they can't
into a woman.

130
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,050
These movies are
mostly made so that

131
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,630
those who can't
get laid can cum.

132
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:55,470
They're made by butchers

133
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,720
who can't tell a camera
from a broom.

134
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,900
Their 'actors' would be
fucking a hole

135
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:06,480
in the wall if there
were no pussy.

136
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:10,190
Do you know
what proves that

137
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,700
there is art in pornography?

138
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:14,530
What?

139
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,790
You, Milos.

140
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,630
You are the proof!

141
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:28,920
Your sense of handling
a woman, your rhythm

142
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:32,840
of exhausting her,
your talent to umiliate her,

143
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:36,600
and then, when she is reduced
to a dog-shit, to win her back.

144
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,140
And your love for it,
that's art.

145
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:48,150
Sadly, this is
no country for real art.

146
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,450
Where there is no life,
there can't be real art.

147
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,530
A real talent will rot here,
while maggots

148
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,790
are giving press conferences.

149
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:03,710
Have you done anything
I could've seen?

150
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,300
I'm doing stuff
that no one else is.

151
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,550
Just for the selected clients.

152
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,760
All right, but what is it?

153
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:20,560
Art, naked art!

154
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:24,230
Truth.

155
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:29,230
Real people, real situations,
real sex...

156
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,530
minimal editing.

157
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,200
There's a serious script.

158
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,450
We know it, you don't!

159
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:53,380
And what am I
supposed to do?

160
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:58,220
The same as always, Milos.
Just stand before the cameras,

161
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:02,560
whip out your cock,
and fuck until it's raw.

162
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:08,270
I dunno, I'm a little tired
of cameras and fucking.

163
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,940
You're also tired of
humping scum

164
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:15,150
any time your family
needs money.

165
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,910
Kissing some
wretched cunts

166
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,450
with the same lips
you'd kiss your kid.

167
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,510
Thanks, doctor.

168
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,600
What's that?
- The contract.

169
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:53,190
No need to read all,
just the numbers.

170
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,710
Something wrong?

171
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,180
I don't know what I'm
signing, what I'm shooting.

172
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:26,310
You're not supposed to know.

173
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:29,730
If you knew,
you wouldn't be so good.

174
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:28,330
<i>In a winter night
way up the hill</i>

175
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:34,210
<i>A creek was fozen
and covered by the snow.</i>

176
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:40,840
<i>A bunny's weeping
for that frozen creek</i>

177
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:46,550
<i>young bunny's crying
with all his heart.</i>

178
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:53,390
<i>But poor li'l bunny
there upon the hill</i>

179
00:20:54,770 --> 00:21:00,780
<i>perhaps he' after the swallows
heading for a warmer South.</i>

180
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:08,240
Vukmir! Sounds like a name
of one of your guys

181
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,540
at the Hague tribunal.

182
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,160
Are you sure he's not
an arms dealer?

183
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:17,380
No, he's some kind of
an artist philosopher

184
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,550
with a grand plan.

185
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:21,920
So, is it grand?

186
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:26,010
Dunno, but seems like he
desperately needs me

187
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:30,470
since he's willing
to offer such cash.

188
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:36,850
How much?

189
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,650
I won't tell you.

190
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,950
Yes you will,
or I'm not giving it back.

191
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,030
OK, I'll tell you,
just let go.

192
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:05,050
Don't tell me you refused?

193
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,180
Of course I did.

194
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:11,930
I wanted to see if you're
with me for the money.

195
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:15,310
If I were,
I'd have dumped you

196
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,600
for your brother long ago.

197
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:27,200
So, you prefer poor
porn stars to bad cops.

198
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,580
Does it means that I should
rent my dick to Vukmir?

199
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,920
Remember what
you told me

200
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:46,420
when I asked
if you missed your job?

201
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:51,600
Milos, I want both of your
heads to be clear and hard.

202
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:54,140
If it's true...

203
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,390
If what is true?

204
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,230
That you were always
able to have it erected

205
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,900
with no touching
or looking.

206
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:10,070
Like a cock at dawn,
rising to its own song.

207
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:14,410
I also know that
you filmed all your scenes

208
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,620
in the first take.

209
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:19,960
Don't be so modest,

210
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,250
you're the best,
that's why you're here.

211
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,900
How long do you
think it would take?

212
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,450
A few days.

213
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:18,080
I haven't translated
from Russian since 1994.

214
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:31,590
What is it exactly?
Some take-over contract?

215
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:36,590
We're sending some goods
to Moscow for redistribution.

216
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:53,690
Want one?
- Yes.

217
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,660
No thanks.

218
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,870
You said you would.

219
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,540
Oh, sorry.
I'm a bit...

220
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:11,670
I miss female company.

221
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,970
A least you can always
arrest a fine looking lady.

222
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:20,390
Yes, but I doubt I'll
ever have the real thing.

223
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:26,350
A relationship, marriage.
Like two of you.

224
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:31,860
You stopped
hoping too soon.

225
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:34,030
Women here like
men in uniform.

226
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:36,530
Especially if
they're not wearing it.

227
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,700
Sorry, gotta go
to the bathroom.

228
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:24,850
You know what
they say about rye.

229
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:30,810
It's high time you started
taking care of yourself.

230
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:34,480
With great talent comes a great
desire for self-fuckability.

231
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:37,480
Whe, exactly, do we start?
- In three days.

232
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,240
I'm not comfortable with
not knowing a thing.

233
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,780
Milos, get a grip.
You're a porn actor

234
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:48,240
who wants to know
what a porno film is about?

235
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,500
It's a bit absurd.

236
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:54,960
You're not supposed
to know, but only to relax.

237
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:01,170
That's too much money
to leave anything to accident.

238
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:03,260
Nothing is left to accident.

239
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:07,300
Milos, that is
a serious organization.

240
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,850
My clients know
exactly what they want,

241
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,810
and I know
what I'm doing.

242
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:19,570
Don't worry, everything
is already prepared,

243
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:22,240
you just have to appear,
be what you are,

244
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,740
relax and react
as Milos would.

245
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:32,410
Pornography should not
be an illusion,

246
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:35,040
but a live
transmission of sex.

247
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:37,330
<i>Dad.
- Yes, son.</i>

248
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,880
Remember the little wheels?

249
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:43,510
I do.

250
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:46,590
Do you know how
to make them spin?

251
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:51,810
I do. But you
must do it yourself.

252
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,270
We all do it alone.

253
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,350
Tell me how.

254
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:02,190
When you feel them,
try to follow them

255
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:06,740
It's a familiy travelling

256
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:12,620
and you just close
your eyes and follow them.

257
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:21,920
Wait, the wheels are
spinning better at night.

258
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,930
Put it in your ear.

259
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:37,580
<i>Enter the building,
relaxed.</i>

260
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:55,260
"Home for Abandoned
and Orphaned Children"

261
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,870
<i>Walk slowly ahead.</i>

262
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:26,630
Be natural.

263
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:35,360
I wish I impaled
myself on a fence rather

264
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:37,410
than giving birth to you!

265
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:41,120
Haven't told you not to let
the villains take you away?

266
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:44,080
Get lost, you
misbegotten wretch!

267
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,670
What are you staring at?

268
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:58,100
<i>Bravo.</i>

269
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:08,060
What was it like?

270
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,230
Fine.

271
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:17,820
We were filming at
a Home for orphaned children.

272
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:21,080
Where?

273
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:23,000
Drag yourself over here!

274
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,790
Look at yourself.
You can't raise a dick,

275
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,040
how will you raise a child?

276
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:31,420
The child is mine.
Raiko only made it.

277
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:34,260
I gave birth to it.
Come, you bitch!

278
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:39,390
Let me go, villains!

279
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,350
Give me back my child,
you bastards!

280
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:16,980
<i>Honey?
- Hi.</i>

281
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:18,440
<i>What are you doing?</i>

282
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:20,860
I picked up
Petar from classes.

283
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:24,070
I'm taking him to a costume
party. Are you coming?

284
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:27,570
No, I'm tired.
Must get some sleep.

285
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,240
<i>Everything all right?</i>

286
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:31,740
Sure. Just you
enjoy yourselves.

287
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:34,830
Talk to you later,
must park now. Bye.

288
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,920
<i>The cake is coming.</i>

289
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:42,210
<i>Never seen such
a cake in my life.</i>

290
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:47,760
<i>Aren't you in action?
- Marko, you must do me a favor.</i>

291
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,220
I'm all dick.

292
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:55,480
<i>I need a detailed check
on my director,</i>

293
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,020
producer, pimp, goddam
businessman, Vukmir.

294
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:04,440
I don't know his last name.
Check his whole crew.

295
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:10,620
Little bro has changed his
views on checking his friends?

296
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:15,040
Look, it's important
and urgent.

297
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:19,290
Understood.
Everything OK with you?

298
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:22,250
Yes, so far.
How about you?

299
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:24,960
Working on it.

300
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:37,270
<i>Light the candles.</i>

301
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,570
<i>Happy birthday, dear Petar...</i>

302
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:57,120
Baby, the time is flying
and your animal

303
00:39:57,330 --> 00:39:58,870
is snoozing again.

304
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:06,130
<i>Come on, blow harder.
Blow harder.</i>

305
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:11,640
Blow harder.
Bravo!

306
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:18,480
<i>Now we're gonna open
the present from uncle.</i>

307
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,770
This is the present
from your uncle.

308
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:24,480
How do you open this?

309
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:34,990
Happy birthday,
my sweet son.

310
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:31,920
What do you think, how does he
manage to be so hard so long?

311
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:37,100
It's not a dick,
it's a police stick!

312
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:41,020
If you don't know,
I can't help you.

313
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:47,770
The bitches are leaking all over,
he's servicing all three of them.

314
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:52,650
How come he's not tired?

315
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:56,950
Why isn't he fucking limp,
like all the normal people?

316
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:05,540
You're at it again!

317
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:09,840
That's hardly gonna
shape it like we all want.

318
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:14,340
What was so urgent?

319
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:17,640
You tell me,
what are we shooting?

320
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:22,980
Are those cameramen real cops?
Are they protection? What from?

321
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:26,850
Cut the crap!

322
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:31,190
You're drunk, nearly
impotent and turning dumb.

323
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:34,240
I may be dumb,
but not naive.

324
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:38,370
Vukimr knows what he's doing.
I trust him more than myself.

325
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:41,740
They're the greatest pros
you've ever worked with.

326
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:45,460
What've you done previously
with those pros of yours?

327
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:50,040
Don't take it all on me cause
I fuck animals for art's sake,

328
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,670
while you can't take
a bit of uncertainty

329
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,510
for some big bucks.

330
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:59,390
Does it mean I'll have to suck
a donkey's dick for money?

331
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,060
It's not so bad,
trust me.

332
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:05,770
Better than the crap
you've been lately.

333
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:14,820
You know I miss that.
- What?

334
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:17,400
The certainty of that crap.

335
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:19,820
At least I knew
what I was filming.

336
00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:23,700
Do you miss this?

337
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:33,380
You're losing it.

338
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:36,340
Lucky for you
Vukmir hasn't noticed yet.

339
00:43:57,030 --> 00:43:59,820
You're resting
from healthy life.

340
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:04,280
How was the
costume party?

341
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:10,330
Hey, what's that?
- It's a stand up balloon.

342
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:37,570
Your Raiko was
a war hero.

343
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:43,490
If only he knew about
his whife's whoring!

344
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:52,460
He would've killed both you
and that poor child of yours.

345
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:03,280
What the hell
is all this, people?

346
00:46:03,610 --> 00:46:06,070
Hello, I can't work
like this!

347
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,800
Hit the whore.
Hit the whore!

348
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,600
Hit her.

349
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:20,610
Bravo, bravo!
Magnificent!

350
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,070
Milos?

351
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:37,500
Milos, what's wrong?

352
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:39,330
I'm not doing this.
I'm not beating women

353
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:41,170
in front of kids or cameras.

354
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:45,380
Milos, Jeca is our kid.
I'd never dream of hurting her.

355
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:48,720
Her mother fucked everything,
from stones to barbed wire.

356
00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:51,180
You're like
a Sunday picnic for her.

357
00:47:51,350 --> 00:47:53,180
I'm not only an artist
but also a professional.

358
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:55,220
I'd never do a thing
against one's will.

359
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:57,060
You're doing against mine.

360
00:47:57,270 --> 00:47:59,600
I won't stand
any kind of torture.

361
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,520
Yeah, you seem to
know a lot about torture.

362
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,690
Did you enjoy less than
a midget woman whoom

363
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:08,950
you locked up in an oven in
Stuttgart and pierced a hole

364
00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:11,370
in it so she could
suck you up for hours?

365
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:19,160
At least your
dick enjoyed it,

366
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:25,960
and he never lies.

367
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:31,640
Vukmir Vukmir.
His name is also his surname.

368
00:48:34,050 --> 00:48:37,560
Worked as a psychologist
in orphanages until 1992.

369
00:48:41,770 --> 00:48:44,320
Then he moved
to the Children's Program

370
00:48:44,570 --> 00:48:47,030
of the State TV. It's
getting better and better!

371
00:48:47,570 --> 00:48:50,200
A lifelong fascination
with the world of film.

372
00:48:53,490 --> 00:48:56,120
Now, it follows with a
mess I had to clarify

373
00:48:56,370 --> 00:48:58,870
with data from
the State Security.

374
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:03,670
Allegedly, he worked
for them, too.

375
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:09,260
Sent abroad on a mission,
his trace was lost in Japan.

376
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:13,970
If he's done any movies,
no one's seen them.

377
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:19,980
That's about it.

378
00:49:21,270 --> 00:49:23,310
I don't know
what bothers you.

379
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:26,980
According to this

380
00:49:27,110 --> 00:49:29,320
you've never worked
with a more educated man.

381
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:31,780
Who are you gonna trust
if not a child psychologist.

382
00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:33,740
who is working
for the Security?

383
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:51,650
Hit it, dad, tear it, dad,
uncle Vukmir is shooting.

384
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:41,410
Want something to eat?

385
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:43,740
No, I've had my
daily dose of rye.

386
00:51:56,550 --> 00:52:00,050
You don't have to go, you
can do it over the phone.

387
00:52:01,050 --> 00:52:04,600
No, I must show up.
It wouldn't be fair.

388
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:01,950
Today we're shooting
at home again.

389
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:06,240
Without me.
As today, I'm retiring.

390
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:16,380
Is there any way for me
to convince you otherwise?

391
00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:18,130
No.

392
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:24,180
The kids bother me. I can't do
such stuff in the kindergarten.

393
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:27,640
I fully understand you.

394
00:53:29,810 --> 00:53:32,480
But, in that case
between you and the kids,

395
00:53:32,730 --> 00:53:35,900
I must choose kids. They're
my specialty, my whole life.

396
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:40,820
It's my fault. I thought you'd
be better if you didn't know...

397
00:53:42,610 --> 00:53:46,160
If I had known from the start,
I'd only have declined sooner.

398
00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:51,330
What did you say,
kindergarten?

399
00:53:53,170 --> 00:53:55,540
That's a good term.

400
00:53:58,250 --> 00:54:01,510
This whole fucking country is
one big shitty kindergarten.

401
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:05,760
A bunch of kids
discarded by their parents.

402
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:08,810
Do you know
what it feels like?

403
00:54:09,470 --> 00:54:12,310
Your whole life you're
compelled to prove

404
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:15,400
that you're able
to take care of yourself.

405
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:19,320
To prove that you
can shit, eat, fuck

406
00:54:19,570 --> 00:54:21,690
drink, bleed, earn money...

407
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:25,700
do whatever it takes
to survive, until you die

408
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:31,790
Would you believe m
if I told you that me and

409
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:36,170
this wonderful family, that
you're so anxious to leave

410
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:41,210
are the only warrant of
this nation's survival?

411
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:47,180
We are the backbone
of this country's economy.

412
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:51,930
Only we can prove that
this nation is alive

413
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:55,850
and useful for anything.

414
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:03,240
I can see that you're insane,
I need no proof for that

415
00:55:04,110 --> 00:55:07,110
Just tell me, how does it
all connect to pornography?

416
00:55:11,290 --> 00:55:15,250
No, Milos, no, no!

417
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:22,300
Not pornography,
but life itself!

418
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:25,720
That's life of a victim.

419
00:55:26,550 --> 00:55:29,510
Love, art, blood...

420
00:55:31,470 --> 00:55:34,270
Flesh and soul of a victim.

421
00:55:34,890 --> 00:55:38,520
Transmitted live to the
world who has lost all that

422
00:55:39,310 --> 00:55:42,360
and now is paying
to watch that

423
00:55:42,610 --> 00:55:45,690
from the comfort
of an armchair.

424
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:49,320
I have no doubt
that it sells well

425
00:55:49,490 --> 00:55:51,950
based on the sum
you offered me.

426
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:55,830
Victim sells, Milos.

427
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:02,630
Victim is the priciest
sell in this world.

428
00:56:03,550 --> 00:56:07,050
The victim feels the most
and suffers the best.

429
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:10,640
We are victim, Milos.

430
00:56:10,890 --> 00:56:13,890
You, me, this whole
nation is a victim.

431
00:56:14,470 --> 00:56:16,730
We're just too retarded.

432
00:56:17,310 --> 00:56:20,150
And I won't be
a victim because of that.

433
00:56:22,190 --> 00:56:23,360
But Milos...

434
00:56:23,690 --> 00:56:26,440
you're the only one in this
film who is not a victim!

435
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:29,740
Is that so?

436
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,000
Allow me,
as your shepherd

437
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,330
to show you
the power of a real victim.

438
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:07,650
Can it be that you
don't get it?

439
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:10,980
This is a new genre, Milos!

440
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:15,110
Newborn porn!

441
00:59:16,610 --> 00:59:18,280
Newborn!

442
00:59:32,550 --> 00:59:36,220
<i>...so that tomorrow,
on 18th of May...</i>

443
00:59:36,470 --> 00:59:40,100
<i>...you'll witness a new Serbian
jet-set extravagance...</i>

444
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:50,330
<i>Mobile user is not
available at the moment...</i>

445
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:02,670
<i>Mobile user is not
available at the moment...</i>

446
01:05:19,350 --> 01:05:21,310
If you only
knew how easily

447
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:23,690
cattle aphrodisiac
is diluited in whiskey.

448
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:26,730
Actually, rye doesn't kill
sexual desire at all, right?

449
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:31,910
Viagra for bulls!

450
01:05:32,070 --> 01:05:35,660
A special recipe concockted
by our sexy doctor who is

451
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:38,950
so fond of speed that
she puts it into coffee, too.

452
01:05:39,790 --> 01:05:41,120
Can he follow
my words?

453
01:05:43,670 --> 01:05:45,000
Now, that's our stud!

454
01:05:46,170 --> 01:05:47,590
Look at him, look at him!

455
01:05:48,380 --> 01:05:49,760
Bravo, bravo!

456
01:06:38,390 --> 01:06:41,020
<i>She's a dirty junky cunt!</i>

457
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:43,770
<i>She destroyed her child,
daughter of a war hero!</i>

458
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:47,940
<i>Sweet little Jeca watched
her mother fuck the junky bums.</i>

459
01:06:48,190 --> 01:06:51,740
<i>She is scum.
Hit the whore! Hit the bitch!</i>

460
01:06:55,660 --> 01:06:57,780
Yeah, you bitch!

461
01:06:58,870 --> 01:07:01,290
<i>Yes, that's one
of the bitch-mothers</i>

462
01:07:01,540 --> 01:07:03,710
<i>who conceive
babies in lust</i>

463
01:07:03,870 --> 01:07:05,790
<i>and than throw
them into a river.</i>

464
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:07,750
<i>The lustful
brood of wenches</i>

465
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,250
<i>with endless
gashes in them.</i>

466
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:22,560
<i>Imagine she were
your son's mother.</i>

467
01:07:22,770 --> 01:07:25,440
<i>Imagine her turning Petar
into a dog-fucker's bitch!</i>

468
01:07:26,310 --> 01:07:28,020
<i>Imagine that, Milos!</i>

469
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:33,150
<i>Strike her, hit her!</i>

470
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:54,420
<i>That's it!
Bravo!</i>

471
01:07:55,340 --> 01:07:58,300
<i>The unique magic of
rigor mortis!</i>

472
01:10:37,170 --> 01:10:40,010
<i>That's right, make it right.</i>

473
01:10:43,380 --> 01:10:45,140
<i>Fucking cell!</i>

474
01:10:49,390 --> 01:10:51,180
<i>What?</i>

475
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:56,110
<i>Never mind, he'll come to me.
Don't worry, he will.</i>

476
01:10:59,070 --> 01:11:02,570
<i>Fucking hell.
OK, run now.</i>

477
01:11:27,510 --> 01:11:29,600
<i>This one is on me.</i>

478
01:12:05,970 --> 01:12:08,260
<i>Now you ruined it all.
You've destroyed the project.</i>

479
01:12:08,470 --> 01:12:09,930
<i>I did what? How?</i>

480
01:12:10,180 --> 01:12:13,390
<i>You could've drugged any of
your apes to fuck like insane.</i>

481
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:17,810
<i>You had Milos. Now you don't.
Now he's a headless dick.</i>

482
01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:21,610
<i>If only you sliced, say,
his son's ear</i>

483
01:12:21,860 --> 01:12:24,400
<i>he'd be his old self again!</i>

484
01:12:25,110 --> 01:12:28,320
<i>He'd fuck God in the ass
at your command!</i>

485
01:12:28,660 --> 01:12:33,160
<i>Instead, you take a genius and
fill him with a fuck-dope.</i>

486
01:12:34,290 --> 01:12:37,040
<i>You're cheap,
just like everyone else.</i>

487
01:12:37,250 --> 01:12:39,790
<i>Fear is bad.
It's a downer.</i>

488
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:44,130
<i>He needs to rise high. To feel
the ecstasy of a free fuck.</i>

489
01:12:44,510 --> 01:12:47,340
<i>When he feels it,
he'll forget all</i>

490
01:12:47,590 --> 01:12:50,340
<i>including his wife,
son, mother...</i>

491
01:12:51,550 --> 01:12:54,470
<i>What do you know
about free fuck?</i>

492
01:12:55,270 --> 01:12:58,270
<i>What do you
know of ecstasy?</i>

493
01:12:59,190 --> 01:13:01,860
<i>This is no art.
You're no longer an artist!</i>

494
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:05,820
<i>I'm not working
for you anymore.</i>

495
01:13:06,070 --> 01:13:08,700
<i>Nor is Milos.
I'm taking him home.</i>

496
01:15:37,430 --> 01:15:39,220
Get away from me!

497
01:15:49,730 --> 01:15:54,320
<i>God itself brought you, son.
God sent you to deliver us...</i>

498
01:15:55,030 --> 01:15:59,620
God itself brought you, son.
God sent you to deliver us...

499
01:16:00,030 --> 01:16:03,660
from that whore,
may she rest in peace,

500
01:16:05,660 --> 01:16:10,290
She was a shame
to our house.

501
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:16,760
Raiko was a great warrior,
but had a poor taste in women.

502
01:16:18,890 --> 01:16:24,350
Since he was killed, this house
rots with no male to govern it.

503
01:16:25,810 --> 01:16:31,610
That's why God sent you as
our savior from all worry.

504
01:16:38,740 --> 01:16:44,450
There's not only house, but a
daughter to take care of, too.

505
01:16:47,290 --> 01:16:52,090
Our poor Jeca
became an orphan.

506
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:56,630
My Alice in Wonderland.

507
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:01,640
Raiko was killed just
when he was supposed to

508
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:06,020
prove to Jeca that
he's not only a father,

509
01:17:06,310 --> 01:17:09,980
but a man as well.
You came instead of him.

510
01:17:12,230 --> 01:17:16,150
You'll have the honor
of giving her

511
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:20,360
a virgin's communion.
To make her a woman.

512
01:17:22,740 --> 01:17:26,910
Like my late father
did with me.

513
01:17:38,090 --> 01:17:41,510
Come on, come on...

514
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:47,220
Now!

515
01:18:00,610 --> 01:18:02,780
I'm gonna cut it off,
you motherfuckers!

516
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:04,580
No, Milos, no...

517
01:18:16,460 --> 01:18:18,090
<i>Our film jumped
through the window!</i>

518
01:18:18,420 --> 01:18:20,050
<i>What are you waiting
for? After him!</i>

519
01:20:56,370 --> 01:21:00,630
<i>Marko, it's me. Come for me.
Milos, what's wrong?</i>

520
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:04,880
<i>Where are you?
I'm in the Celopecka street, no 7.</i>

521
01:21:05,130 --> 01:21:07,380
<i>Milos!</i>

522
01:21:42,540 --> 01:21:46,090
Hey, baby, where
you headin' for?

523
01:21:46,590 --> 01:21:50,050
Out naked, but
won't take a dick?

524
01:21:52,090 --> 01:21:55,140
Be polite,
the girl is underage.

525
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:59,310
So what if
I am underage?

526
01:22:05,770 --> 01:22:07,400
Look at this jerk!

527
01:22:31,590 --> 01:22:33,970
No, Rasa, don't.

528
01:22:41,770 --> 01:22:44,690
<i>Rare kind of Monks
put seven adult he-goats</i>

529
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:47,150
<i>into a shed
during summer.</i>

530
01:22:47,980 --> 01:22:50,940
<i>They leave them
for a month</i>

531
01:22:51,150 --> 01:22:54,110
<i>until their balls
are like mellons.</i>

532
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:58,700
<i>When they get too hot,
they start fucking one another.</i>

533
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,040
<i>The monks take the dried
bloody cum off their balls</i>

534
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:05,920
<i>and mix it with milk.</i>

535
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:12,420
<i>It makes the finest
bread spread there is.</i>

536
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:18,470
<i>You're a he-goat, Milos.
I'm your monk.</i>

537
01:23:20,060 --> 01:23:22,690
Don't worry, my child.

538
01:23:27,650 --> 01:23:30,150
My he-goat.

539
01:23:33,740 --> 01:23:37,370
I'll provide a
fitting end for you.

540
01:26:50,180 --> 01:26:53,850
Welcome to a
warm family home.

541
01:29:48,700 --> 01:29:52,780
A real, happy
Serbian family.

543
01:29:58,910 --> 01:30:00,290
Art.

544
01:31:29,510 --> 01:31:33,180
That's it, Milos.
That's the cinema.

545
01:32:49,710 --> 01:32:51,750
That's film!

546
01:33:06,190 --> 01:33:07,650
Get away from me!

549

01:39:40,750 --> 01:39:42,750
