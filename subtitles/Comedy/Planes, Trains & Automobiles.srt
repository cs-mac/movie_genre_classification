1
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:07,897
THIS SUMMER

2
00:00:10,131 --> 00:00:10,887
FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER

3
00:00:11,082 --> 00:00:13,099
Welcome to the world's fastest sport!

4
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:16,026
THE WORLD OF CARS

5
00:00:16,061 --> 00:00:17,939
Where only the best of the best compete.

6
00:00:20,323 --> 00:00:21,063
TAKES FLIGHT

7
00:00:24,322 --> 00:00:25,908
Ah, for flyin' out loud.

8
00:00:27,615 --> 00:00:31,406
For the first time
we have a crop duster in the race.

9
00:00:31,453 --> 00:00:32,432
Well, he's gonna die.

10
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:35,392
Rusty, you're going up against
the best racers in the world.

11
00:00:35,393 --> 00:00:36,643
THERE'S JUST ONE PROBLEM

12
00:00:36,694 --> 00:00:38,092
I'm afraid of heights!

13
00:00:38,093 --> 00:00:39,868
That airplane needs some help,
y'all know that, right?

14
00:00:40,065 --> 00:00:40,765
Yeah!

15
00:00:40,766 --> 00:00:43,370
It ain't how fast you fly,
it's how you fly fast.

16
00:00:43,371 --> 00:00:45,974
You can fly a whole lot
higher than you think.

17
00:00:45,975 --> 00:00:48,160
Ballistic!

18
00:00:48,161 --> 00:00:48,958
He's ready.

19
00:00:49,287 --> 00:00:50,161
THE PLANES ARE ARRIVING

20
00:00:50,287 --> 00:00:54,550
Hey, look who made it. It's Rusty.
Dusty. Dusty Crophopper.

21
00:00:54,551 --> 00:00:55,383
Farm boy.

22
00:00:55,594 --> 00:00:56,687
FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD

23
00:00:57,414 --> 00:00:59,658
Wow, you're Bulldog, tallyho!

24
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:02,526
Most people call me Ishani.

25
00:01:02,561 --> 00:01:04,064
I'm El Chupacabra.

26
00:01:04,778 --> 00:01:06,359
We will have many adventures.

27
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,672
We will laugh, we will cry, we will dance!

28
00:01:11,411 --> 00:01:12,739
Probably not with each other.

29
00:01:13,951 --> 00:01:15,669
Don't let anything distract you.

30
00:01:18,343 --> 00:01:22,105
She is like a sunrise after
a lifetime of darkness.

31
00:01:22,106 --> 00:01:27,035
Or like fresh fertilizer on
a field of dying grass.

32
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,637
This is not your thing, my friend.

33
00:01:31,217 --> 00:01:33,913
Danke for representing all us little planes.

34
00:01:33,948 --> 00:01:34,828
But, you're a car.

35
00:01:37,553 --> 00:01:40,185
Serious identity issues.

36
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:40,980
FROM DISNEY

37
00:01:41,126 --> 00:01:43,242
You think you can beat me?

38
00:01:44,498 --> 00:01:46,029
I swish my cape at you!

39
00:01:46,228 --> 00:01:48,236
You have been shamed.

40
00:01:48,436 --> 00:01:49,412
IF YOU LOOKING FOR A HERO

41
00:01:49,518 --> 00:01:50,599
Kennedy approach, over.

42
00:01:51,034 --> 00:01:52,643
Go back to Jersey, ya bum.

43
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:53,897
WATCH THE SKIES

44
00:01:53,938 --> 00:01:57,095
This is Dusty Crophopper.
I'm caught in a storm! I'm going down!

45
00:01:57,738 --> 00:01:58,718
I'm going down!

46
00:02:00,922 --> 00:02:04,585
It's a really compelling underdog story.
Like Old Yeller.

47
00:02:04,586 --> 00:02:06,937
- That's not an underdog story!
- There was a dog in it.

48
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,541
- Go!
- Yes!

49
00:02:15,356 --> 00:02:16,060
What?

50
00:02:16,779 --> 00:02:18,153
Oh, man. That's nasty.

51
00:02:18,154 --> 00:02:19,607
PLANES

52
00:02:19,716 --> 00:02:22,415
Mayday! Mayday! Big castle! Roll right!

53
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:23,518
I owe you my life.

54
00:02:23,716 --> 00:02:26,218
- Are you crying?
- I don't cry, I'm British.

55
00:02:26,537 --> 00:02:27,181
IN THEATRES

56
00:02:27,182 --> 00:02:28,182
IN THEATRES AUGUST 9
