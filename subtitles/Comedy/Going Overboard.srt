1
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:07,165
Move it, dorkus.

2
00:01:10,809 --> 00:01:13,528
Okay, I think you're next.
I'll take your ticket.

3
00:01:14,329 --> 00:01:16,843
Come right around this way.
Keep your back straight.

4
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:18,647
Put your books down on your lap.

5
00:01:18,809 --> 00:01:22,597
Now, look right up at the camera,
okay? Nice smile. Here we go.

6
00:01:22,769 --> 00:01:26,125
Let me focus right over here.
Okay. Get you in.

7
00:01:26,289 --> 00:01:27,642
That's good.

8
00:01:27,809 --> 00:01:30,118
Swing around this way
just a little bit, Gina.

9
00:01:30,289 --> 00:01:32,325
- It's Jenna.
- Look over here, Gina.

10
00:01:32,489 --> 00:01:34,161
It's Jenna!

11
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:47,880
Oh, God.

12
00:01:48,929 --> 00:01:50,601
Oh, no.

13
00:01:57,249 --> 00:01:59,604
I've had enough already.

14
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:10,761
Hey, Jenna.

15
00:02:11,249 --> 00:02:13,080
Matt, please. No more pictures.

16
00:02:13,249 --> 00:02:16,366
Come on. It's your 13th birthday.
We gotta document it.

17
00:02:26,169 --> 00:02:28,683
- Hi, Tom-Tom.
- Hey, Jenna.

18
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:31,158
Hi, Beaver.
How's everything at the dam?

19
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:35,124
- So how'd yours come out, Rink?
- Not so good.

20
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:37,166
Yeah, mine aren't so hot either.

21
00:02:37,329 --> 00:02:40,844
- Tom-Tom, yours are great!
- Yours are the best.

22
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:43,560
God, you're so photogenic.

23
00:02:43,729 --> 00:02:45,048
I'll meet you out front.

24
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:48,519
Do whatever you want. It's not
like she needs a play-by-play.

25
00:02:51,529 --> 00:02:53,963
- Freakazoid.
- See you.

26
00:02:55,169 --> 00:02:57,637
Jenna, could I talk to you
a tiny sec?

27
00:02:59,289 --> 00:03:02,520
I told Chris Grandy me and the
Six Chicks were going to your party.

28
00:03:02,689 --> 00:03:05,522
- And he said he wanted to come with.
- Really?

29
00:03:05,689 --> 00:03:08,965
Yeah, it's too bad we can't make it,
because we really wanted to.

30
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:10,608
- Didn't we, girls?
- Totally.

31
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:12,805
- So, so much.
- We're so sorry.

32
00:03:12,969 --> 00:03:15,688
Miss Measly's up our butts
with this group project...

33
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:17,805
and Chris is gonna help us out...

34
00:03:17,969 --> 00:03:20,688
so I guess he can't come either.

35
00:03:22,649 --> 00:03:26,528
- I could write your report for you.
- Fabuloso.

36
00:03:34,569 --> 00:03:38,005
You know, I can't believe
you invited those clones.

37
00:03:38,169 --> 00:03:39,727
They're my friends.

38
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:42,323
Six Chicks are not your friends, okay?

39
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:44,923
Well, almost. And someday
I'm gonna be a Six Chick.

40
00:03:45,089 --> 00:03:48,968
There's six of them. That's the point.
There can't be a seventh Six Chick.

41
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:50,926
It's just mathematically impossible.

42
00:03:51,089 --> 00:03:53,478
You're cooler than they are.
They're unoriginal.

43
00:03:53,649 --> 00:03:56,607
I don't wanna be original, Matty,
I wanna be cool.

44
00:03:57,969 --> 00:04:00,688
- Want some Razzles?
- Razzles are for kids.

45
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:03,161
Exactly.

46
00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:09,967
- Arrivederci.
- Au rev oir.

47
00:04:48,969 --> 00:04:50,482
- Hey, sweetie.
- Happy birthday!

48
00:04:50,649 --> 00:04:52,799
Tell us about your new
life as a teenager.

49
00:04:52,969 --> 00:04:55,244
What did you do?
Are you wearing a bra?

50
00:04:55,409 --> 00:04:59,118
- Go away!
- Oh, honey, what's wrong?

51
00:04:59,289 --> 00:05:01,723
Wayne. Self-image.

52
00:05:02,289 --> 00:05:05,520
- Jenna, it's going to be all right.
- It is not, Mom! Look at me!

53
00:05:05,689 --> 00:05:10,080
- This is not okay. This is fatal.
- It's not fatal, honey. It's realistic.

54
00:05:10,249 --> 00:05:11,523
I hate my life.

55
00:05:11,689 --> 00:05:13,919
You don't look like girls
in Poise magazine...

56
00:05:14,089 --> 00:05:16,842
but you're beautiful
in your own way.

57
00:05:17,009 --> 00:05:19,204
I don't wanna be beautiful
in my own way.

58
00:05:19,369 --> 00:05:21,678
I wanna look like these people.

59
00:05:22,209 --> 00:05:24,677
Oh, those aren't people, honey.
Those are models.

60
00:05:25,769 --> 00:05:30,047
"Thirty, flirty and thriving. Why the
30s are the best years of your life."

61
00:05:30,209 --> 00:05:31,642
I wanna be 30.

62
00:05:32,849 --> 00:05:34,407
Well, you will be, honey.

63
00:05:34,569 --> 00:05:37,606
But right now you're my
beautiful 13-year-old.

64
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:09,761
- Happy birthday!
- Oh, my God.

65
00:06:09,929 --> 00:06:13,808
This is just part one of your present.
I got something else to give you later.

66
00:06:14,089 --> 00:06:15,568
What is it?

67
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:19,963
You know how you always
wanted a Barbie Dream House?

68
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:25,886
Well, I decided to make you
your own Jenna Dream House.

69
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:33,607
- You made all this? Oh, Matty.
- Yeah.

70
00:06:34,849 --> 00:06:38,398
See, that's you in your bubble bath,
reading your favourite magazine.

71
00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:41,845
And there's your bedroom,
with a massive stereo...

72
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:44,204
and every record ever made.

73
00:06:44,369 --> 00:06:45,768
The good ones.

74
00:06:45,929 --> 00:06:51,128
And there's that bum Rick Springfield
loafing on the couch.

75
00:06:52,929 --> 00:06:56,399
And there I am, to make sure the
creep keeps his hands to himself.

76
00:06:57,409 --> 00:07:01,721
Oh, almost forgot. Wishing dust.

77
00:07:02,049 --> 00:07:06,361
It says, "This wishing dust knows
what's in your heart of hearts.

78
00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:08,918
It'll make all your dreams
come true."

79
00:07:29,609 --> 00:07:31,327
They're here.

80
00:07:31,489 --> 00:07:33,207
What do we do?

81
00:07:35,089 --> 00:07:37,649
Oh, my God. Matt, I'm just
gonna put this away, okay?

82
00:07:37,809 --> 00:07:39,686
So there's room to dance.

83
00:07:42,609 --> 00:07:44,486
Put some music on.

84
00:07:47,249 --> 00:07:50,764
Dad, you promised you were
gonna stay upstairs. Go!

85
00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:56,599
Hi, guys. The party's downstairs.

86
00:08:06,209 --> 00:08:07,961
Fabuloso.

87
00:08:50,769 --> 00:08:54,125
- What is this?
- I'm not sure. It's Matt's.

88
00:09:03,489 --> 00:09:05,878
Sorry, Beave-head. Majority rules.

89
00:09:07,289 --> 00:09:11,077
Narrow, man.
Narrow, hopeless people.

90
00:09:11,369 --> 00:09:13,724
- Freak.
- Robot.

91
00:09:18,409 --> 00:09:20,479
I'm gonna go next door
and get my Casio.

92
00:09:20,649 --> 00:09:23,846
Do whatever you want, Matt.
It's not like I need a play-by-play.

93
00:09:25,569 --> 00:09:27,560
See you, loser.

94
00:09:32,529 --> 00:09:34,963
Hey, I have an idea, girls.

95
00:09:35,129 --> 00:09:37,359
Let's play
Seven Minutes in Heaven.

96
00:09:37,529 --> 00:09:39,884
You can go first,
because you're the birthday girl.

97
00:09:40,049 --> 00:09:41,687
How does that one go, again?

98
00:09:41,849 --> 00:09:45,478
Well, you go in the closet, and some
lucky guy's gonna go in there...

99
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:49,927
and do whatever he wants
with you for seven whole minutes.

100
00:09:51,169 --> 00:09:52,807
And guess who wants to go first.

101
00:09:52,969 --> 00:09:54,766
- Who?
- Chris Grandy.

102
00:09:54,929 --> 00:09:57,284
- No way.
- Way.

103
00:10:04,809 --> 00:10:07,323
Before I forget,
where's our project proposal?

104
00:10:07,689 --> 00:10:09,566
- On the table.
- Thanks.

105
00:10:09,729 --> 00:10:12,846
Remember, no peeking.
Keep that blindfold on.

106
00:10:13,809 --> 00:10:17,165
And just so you know,
Chris loves going for second base.

107
00:10:28,809 --> 00:10:31,926
Let's go. I think I can get
my brother to buy us some beer.

108
00:10:39,329 --> 00:10:42,127
- I got the cheez doodles.
- Wait, give me that drink.

109
00:10:42,289 --> 00:10:44,803
Thank you. Leave it, George.
Come on.

110
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:52,359
- What's going on?
- Jenna's waiting for you in the closet.

111
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:13,960
I thought you weren't gonna come.

112
00:11:22,329 --> 00:11:24,206
Where are you?

113
00:11:29,809 --> 00:11:31,083
Oh, Chris.

114
00:11:32,129 --> 00:11:35,087
- It's not Chris, it's Matt.
- What are you doing here?

115
00:11:36,169 --> 00:11:39,002
- Where's Chris?
- He's gone. Everybody left.

116
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:43,807
- What'd you do?
- Nothing!

117
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:46,085
- Yes, you did!
- I just went to get my Casio!

118
00:11:46,769 --> 00:11:48,805
- Get out!
- Wait! Jenna, let me talk to you!

119
00:11:48,969 --> 00:11:51,244
- Get out! No!
- Jenna, please, just come out!

120
00:11:51,409 --> 00:11:53,969
I hate you! I hate me!
I hate everybody!

121
00:11:54,289 --> 00:11:57,008
- Jenna, what are you talking about?
- I wanna be 30!

122
00:11:57,169 --> 00:12:00,320
Just let me play you this song, okay?
It’ll make you feel better.

123
00:12:00,489 --> 00:12:05,404
I wanna be 30.
Thirty and flirty and thriving.

124
00:12:06,369 --> 00:12:09,441
Thirty and flirty and thriving.

125
00:12:09,609 --> 00:12:14,399
Thirty and flirty and thriving.
Thirty and flirty and thriving.

126
00:12:14,569 --> 00:12:19,245
Thirty and flirty and thriving.
Thirty and flirty and thriving.

127
00:12:19,409 --> 00:12:22,685
Thirty and flirty and thriving.

128
00:13:13,849 --> 00:13:15,328
Mom?

129
00:13:23,049 --> 00:13:24,562
Mom?

130
00:13:28,209 --> 00:13:29,801
Dad?

131
00:14:14,289 --> 00:14:16,041
What is happening?

132
00:14:16,969 --> 00:14:21,565
Oh, what is happening?
What is going on?

133
00:14:35,729 --> 00:14:38,721
"Jenna Rink."

134
00:14:38,889 --> 00:14:43,280
"Jenna Rink.
Jenna Rink, Jenna Rink."

135
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:45,167
I live here.

136
00:14:50,929 --> 00:14:52,806
- Hi. Sorry we missed your call.
- Dad?

137
00:14:52,969 --> 00:14:55,529
Well, not that sorry,
because we're in the Caribbean.

138
00:14:55,689 --> 00:15:00,080
So we'll be back on the 18th,
so call us then. Have a good day.

139
00:15:00,249 --> 00:15:03,286
You went on a cruise without me?

140
00:15:05,329 --> 00:15:09,880
Oh, this is a dream.
This is a really weird dream.

141
00:15:28,889 --> 00:15:32,928
- Hey, sweet bottom!
- Oh, my God.

142
00:15:40,049 --> 00:15:44,008
I know you're there! And my parents
are totally gonna be home any minute!

143
00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:47,441
Hey, where's the conditioner?

144
00:15:48,009 --> 00:15:50,842
- You're naked!
- Well, not yet.

145
00:15:54,169 --> 00:15:56,364
You could join me if you want.

146
00:15:58,449 --> 00:16:00,121
Sweet bottom!

147
00:16:06,489 --> 00:16:08,047
Can you hear that music?

148
00:16:08,209 --> 00:16:10,677
Jenna? Can you hurry up
a little bit, please?

149
00:16:10,849 --> 00:16:13,363
He made a commitment.
Jenna? Can you come over here?

150
00:16:13,529 --> 00:16:16,248
I don't care if you have to
grab him by his testicles...

151
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:18,479
I want him in New York
in 12 hours.

152
00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:20,844
He needs to be at the party.
Hold on a second.

153
00:16:21,049 --> 00:16:23,722
- Get in the car.
- I don't get in the car with strangers.

154
00:16:23,889 --> 00:16:25,800
Get in the car.
We're gonna be late.

155
00:16:25,969 --> 00:16:28,039
- I don't know you.
- Just get in the car.

156
00:16:28,209 --> 00:16:30,598
- Not with strangers!
- You're being paranoid.

157
00:16:30,769 --> 00:16:33,761
Sweet bottom! Don't make me
come down there and grab you.

158
00:16:33,929 --> 00:16:37,444
Lucy Wyman. He has my number.
Could you please get in the car?

159
00:16:37,609 --> 00:16:39,167
- Jenna!
- We are gonna be late.

160
00:16:39,329 --> 00:16:43,686
Look, he made a commitment. He has
my number. My name is Lucy Wyman.

161
00:16:43,849 --> 00:16:44,998
Just go away!

162
00:16:48,689 --> 00:16:52,159
Honey, I know I'm your best friend,
but the slip dress is a little '97.

163
00:16:52,329 --> 00:16:55,639
- Unless it's retro.
- Are you really my best friend?

164
00:16:56,209 --> 00:16:58,928
- You're pregnant.
- Oh, no! Oh, my God, no!

165
00:16:59,089 --> 00:17:01,967
Thank God. You scared me.
What did you do last night?

166
00:17:02,129 --> 00:17:05,280
See, that's the thing. Something
really strange is happening.

167
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:08,043
I slept in an apartment
I've never seen before...

168
00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:11,406
and there was a naked man
in my shower and I saw his thingy.

169
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:13,127
Oh, God. Not his thingy.

170
00:17:13,289 --> 00:17:16,167
Driver, could you please pull over,
since we're here?

171
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:18,763
- Stop!
- Wait. I don't wanna get out of the...

172
00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:21,807
I don't think you're listening.
Wait, hang on.

173
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:25,886
Wait, listen to me. I'm 13.

174
00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:28,882
If you're gonna start lying about
your age, I'd go with 27.

175
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:32,439
Wait! I know it sounds strange,
but some weird dream is... Like that!

176
00:17:32,609 --> 00:17:34,565
Do you hear it? Did you hear that?

177
00:17:34,729 --> 00:17:38,722
Would you stop being ridiculous?
It's probably just Richard.

178
00:17:40,209 --> 00:17:42,723
- Who's Richard?
- You drink too much.

179
00:17:42,889 --> 00:17:44,686
Richard, your boss.

180
00:17:44,849 --> 00:17:48,364
Brown, curly hair. British. Richard.

181
00:17:48,529 --> 00:17:50,121
- Hello?
- Hey, sweet bottom.

182
00:17:50,289 --> 00:17:54,521
You. You. Put on your pants
and stop calling me "sweet bottom."

183
00:17:54,689 --> 00:17:56,680
- Look, baby...
- And get out of my house!

184
00:17:56,849 --> 00:17:58,282
Who is that?

185
00:17:58,449 --> 00:18:01,361
I don't know his name.
I don't know what's happening.

186
00:18:01,529 --> 00:18:04,282
Okay, Jenna. Jenna.
Just calm down, okay?

187
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:08,844
We have a meeting in 10 minutes.
I'll tell you what to do. Repeat after me:

188
00:18:09,009 --> 00:18:12,365
I am Jenna Rink,
bigtime magazine editor.

189
00:18:12,529 --> 00:18:14,918
- I am?
- Repeat it.

190
00:18:15,249 --> 00:18:18,878
I am Jenna Rink,
bigtime magazine editor.

191
00:18:19,049 --> 00:18:20,198
I'm a tough bitch.

192
00:18:23,689 --> 00:18:27,648
- Say it.
- I am a tough bitch.

193
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:31,006
I'm gonna walk into that office,
I won't let anyone know I'm hung-over.

194
00:18:31,169 --> 00:18:33,558
But that's not the point.
I'm not hung-over...

195
00:18:34,529 --> 00:18:37,123
I'm gonna walk into that office
and not let anyone know I'm hung-over.

196
00:18:37,289 --> 00:18:41,487
Because the future of Poise
depends on me.

197
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:44,047
Poise?

198
00:18:45,649 --> 00:18:46,843
Oh, jeez.

199
00:18:52,169 --> 00:18:53,648
Poise magazine. Thank you.

200
00:18:53,889 --> 00:18:55,686
Good morning, Miss Rink,
Miss Wyman.

201
00:18:55,849 --> 00:18:58,761
- Good morning. What's her name?
- Who cares?

202
00:18:59,249 --> 00:19:01,638
Jenna. Please don't yell at me,
it's not my fault.

203
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:03,879
They need a decision right now.

204
00:19:04,049 --> 00:19:06,119
- Just pick one.
- That one.

205
00:19:06,289 --> 00:19:07,768
Love. Knew it. Genius.

206
00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:10,443
Eminem's on the phone.
He wants a decision now.

207
00:19:11,249 --> 00:19:12,682
Plain.

208
00:19:14,129 --> 00:19:16,518
Peanut. Plain.

209
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:20,841
There's the dynamic duo! I trust my
executive editors are late again...

210
00:19:21,009 --> 00:19:23,477
because they were out
promoting us at parties.

211
00:19:23,649 --> 00:19:26,243
- You got it, Richard.
- Richard. You're my boss.

212
00:19:26,409 --> 00:19:28,718
That's right, baby.
Who's your daddy?

213
00:19:28,889 --> 00:19:30,083
Wayne Rink.

214
00:19:30,809 --> 00:19:32,367
Morning.

215
00:19:35,849 --> 00:19:38,124
Two words: Summer, Saint Barts.

216
00:19:38,289 --> 00:19:40,849
Oh, you're not gonna go
to Fire Island this summer?

217
00:19:41,009 --> 00:19:43,648
- Are you insinuating I'm gay?
- It's a joke.

218
00:19:52,049 --> 00:19:55,246
Is there anything else you
need from me, Miss Rink?

219
00:19:57,929 --> 00:19:59,885
You mean like a favour?

220
00:20:01,089 --> 00:20:02,602
Sure. Like a favour.

221
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:05,124
- I need to find this guy in New Jersey.
- Okay.

222
00:20:05,289 --> 00:20:06,608
I have his number.

223
00:20:10,449 --> 00:20:13,646
- Arlene, will you leave us, please?
- Sorry.

224
00:20:22,849 --> 00:20:24,760
Jenna's a little hung-over today.

225
00:20:26,449 --> 00:20:28,360
Rough.

226
00:20:28,529 --> 00:20:30,759
Okay, children.

227
00:20:43,089 --> 00:20:46,798
I wonder which one
Holly Housewife is going to go for.

228
00:20:46,969 --> 00:20:49,802
The 10th or the 11 Th secret?

229
00:20:59,409 --> 00:21:02,606
Seven months in a row now
they scoop us.

230
00:21:02,769 --> 00:21:07,047
I mean, it's like they've got
Sparkle-cams hidden in all our walls.

231
00:21:07,209 --> 00:21:10,121
Richard, we're installing passwords.

232
00:21:10,289 --> 00:21:12,359
We're building firewalls
on all the computers.

233
00:21:12,529 --> 00:21:14,724
- Jenna fired Charlotte yesterday.
- Did you?

234
00:21:16,649 --> 00:21:19,243
I guarantee she has friends
at Sparkle. She always took notes.

235
00:21:19,409 --> 00:21:21,798
- She was a secretary.
- Yeah, whatever.

236
00:21:23,569 --> 00:21:27,039
Our party tonight is now huge.

237
00:21:27,209 --> 00:21:29,245
We need to make
an unequivocal statement...

238
00:21:29,409 --> 00:21:31,525
that Poise is still hot
and happening.

239
00:21:31,689 --> 00:21:34,840
Now, we need a newsstand
circ analysis done immediately.

240
00:21:35,009 --> 00:21:38,638
I also strongly suggest we take apart
our F.O.B., overhaul the B.O. B...

241
00:21:38,809 --> 00:21:41,881
think about new heads, decks
and slugs. Jenna, what do you think?

242
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:45,168
Can I go to the bathroom?

243
00:22:13,569 --> 00:22:15,844
It's the naked guy.

244
00:22:24,529 --> 00:22:29,159
"Jenna, girl, margaritas anytime.
Love you, Madonna."

245
00:22:30,009 --> 00:22:32,569
I'm friends with Madonna?

246
00:22:40,289 --> 00:22:41,768
Here are your messages.

247
00:22:41,929 --> 00:22:43,999
And your mother called
from Barbados.

248
00:22:44,169 --> 00:22:46,399
My mom called?
I wish you'd told me.

249
00:22:46,569 --> 00:22:48,685
Oh, I'm sorry, Miss Rink.

250
00:22:48,849 --> 00:22:51,727
I thought you said never
to bother you with family calls.

251
00:22:52,169 --> 00:22:55,081
- I did? I said that?
- Please don't fire me.

252
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:58,366
No, no, I won't. It's not your fault.
I forgot that I said that.

253
00:22:58,529 --> 00:23:00,440
Next time my mom calls,
let me know.

254
00:23:00,609 --> 00:23:02,008
Yes, ma'am.

255
00:23:02,169 --> 00:23:05,798
Oh, I have that information
that you asked for.

256
00:23:06,209 --> 00:23:07,881
Matt!

257
00:23:08,689 --> 00:23:10,884
The phone number
you gave me was his parents'

258
00:23:11,049 --> 00:23:14,359
I told them that I worked for Visa
and he's in a lot of trouble.

259
00:23:14,529 --> 00:23:16,804
You lied to the Flamhaffs!

260
00:23:16,969 --> 00:23:21,485
He's in the Village.
212 Bank Street, apartment 2B.

261
00:23:22,009 --> 00:23:24,887
- Which village?
- The... Greenwich Village.

262
00:23:25,049 --> 00:23:27,563
Oh, right. Cool.

263
00:23:29,249 --> 00:23:31,399
Wait! Should I cancel
your 2:30 meeting?

264
00:23:35,729 --> 00:23:37,082
Sorry.

265
00:23:38,929 --> 00:23:40,681
Excuse me?

266
00:23:41,529 --> 00:23:43,042
Sir?

267
00:23:46,129 --> 00:23:47,278
Hello?

268
00:24:13,009 --> 00:24:14,840
Yeah, yeah. Hello. Yeah.

269
00:24:15,009 --> 00:24:17,125
Hi, this is Jenna
and I'm looking for Matt.

270
00:24:17,369 --> 00:24:20,441
I don't know if you're him,
but if you lived on Spruce Street...

271
00:24:20,609 --> 00:24:24,124
and if your favourite shirt is a grey
velour one, I need to speak to you.

272
00:24:24,289 --> 00:24:28,123
Hello? Hello? Hello?
You know what? I got none of that.

273
00:24:28,289 --> 00:24:32,521
If you're here from Ming Gardens,
ring twice. If not, I really don't want it.

274
00:24:40,489 --> 00:24:42,798
You're not Chinese.

275
00:24:43,089 --> 00:24:45,444
- Matt?
- Yeah.

276
00:24:47,249 --> 00:24:50,685
You're tall. You're different.

277
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:54,561
- Yeah.
- You don't know me?

278
00:24:54,729 --> 00:24:56,959
That's weird, because
yesterday you were there.

279
00:24:57,129 --> 00:24:59,404
No, it wasn't yesterday,
because I'm not 13.

280
00:24:59,569 --> 00:25:01,605
- Jenna.
- Yes!

281
00:25:01,769 --> 00:25:04,442
- Jenna Rink.
- Yes! Matt, it's me!

282
00:25:11,609 --> 00:25:14,328
- Hey.
- Oh, Matty!

283
00:25:14,489 --> 00:25:16,241
Come on in.

284
00:25:21,649 --> 00:25:22,923
You still take pictures?

285
00:25:23,089 --> 00:25:26,764
Yeah. You know, it pays the bills.

286
00:25:26,929 --> 00:25:28,999
Hey, Jenna, what are...?
Why are you here?

287
00:25:29,169 --> 00:25:32,718
Matty, I told you. Something
really weird is happening.

288
00:25:32,889 --> 00:25:35,926
Yesterday was my 13th birthday
and then...

289
00:25:36,089 --> 00:25:38,603
And then today I woke up
and I'm this.

290
00:25:38,769 --> 00:25:41,488
And you... I mean, you're that.
You get it?

291
00:25:41,649 --> 00:25:46,200
Are you high? You been smoking pot?
Doing X? Falling into a K-hole?

292
00:25:46,369 --> 00:25:50,965
- Are you doing drugs?
- No. No. Look...

293
00:25:51,129 --> 00:25:55,327
I was sitting in my closet
and I skipped everything.

294
00:25:55,489 --> 00:25:58,481
I mean, it's like a weird dream.
I can't remember my life.

295
00:25:58,649 --> 00:26:00,526
You need to help me
remember my life.

296
00:26:00,689 --> 00:26:02,805
- Me? I can't do that.
- Why not?

297
00:26:04,169 --> 00:26:06,444
I don't know anything
about you, all right?

298
00:26:06,609 --> 00:26:09,328
I haven't seen you
since high school.

299
00:26:10,049 --> 00:26:13,837
- What?
- We're not friends anymore, Jenna.

300
00:26:14,289 --> 00:26:17,565
- Matty, you're my best friend.
- No.

301
00:26:19,889 --> 00:26:22,278
Okay. It's cool.

302
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:25,126
- It's cool.
- Is it warm in here?

303
00:26:25,289 --> 00:26:28,838
It's... Maybe I should open
a window.

304
00:26:29,009 --> 00:26:32,046
I need fresh air and a glass
of water and a fluffy pillow.

305
00:26:32,209 --> 00:26:35,246
Have a seat. I'll get you some...
You want a glass of water?

306
00:26:35,409 --> 00:26:37,923
- You want ice in that?
- I want a fluffy pillow!

307
00:26:38,089 --> 00:26:41,001
A fluffy pillow, coming right up.
Sorry.

308
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:45,327
You all right?

309
00:26:47,529 --> 00:26:52,159
Jenna, I think you should go back to
your apartment. I'll help you find it.

310
00:26:54,209 --> 00:26:57,838
We went separate ways. We went
to different colleges, different careers.

311
00:26:58,009 --> 00:27:01,001
Well, what about Christmas?
Didn't you wanna see me then?

312
00:27:02,369 --> 00:27:05,406
I think I saw you through a frosted
window once, six years ago.

313
00:27:05,569 --> 00:27:07,685
- Six years ago?
- Yeah.

314
00:27:07,849 --> 00:27:09,840
Wasn't I home last Christmas?

315
00:27:10,009 --> 00:27:13,126
I don't know. Doesn't your crowd
do Saint Barts for Christmas?

316
00:27:13,289 --> 00:27:15,007
I don't know.

317
00:27:15,289 --> 00:27:17,325
Is this you?

318
00:27:17,489 --> 00:27:21,323
Yeah. This is where I live now.

319
00:27:27,449 --> 00:27:30,282
Okay, so, nice seeing you.

320
00:27:32,729 --> 00:27:34,242
Good luck.

321
00:27:35,729 --> 00:27:38,323
- Okay?
- Okay.

322
00:27:38,489 --> 00:27:41,322
- Bye.
- Bye.

323
00:27:45,089 --> 00:27:46,488
Matt.

324
00:27:47,889 --> 00:27:50,119
Who is Saint Bart?

325
00:27:56,489 --> 00:28:00,607
The most depressing years of my life.
Our high-school yearbook.

326
00:28:00,769 --> 00:28:02,122
Matt, was I a Six Chick?

327
00:28:02,289 --> 00:28:04,883
Yeah, you were
pretty much their leader.

328
00:28:08,569 --> 00:28:11,003
There's Tom-Tom.
I wonder what happened to her.

329
00:28:11,169 --> 00:28:14,844
Last I heard, you were still good
friends. I think you even work together.

330
00:28:15,009 --> 00:28:17,728
Lucy. Oh, my God, yes.

331
00:28:17,889 --> 00:28:21,802
She's Lucy Wyman now.
She looks so different.

332
00:28:21,969 --> 00:28:25,962
Yeah, she's pretty big into the
whole plastic surgery movement.

333
00:28:26,129 --> 00:28:28,723
- I was the prom queen.
- Yep.

334
00:28:28,889 --> 00:28:32,359
- And I went with Chris Grandy.
- Yep.

335
00:28:32,529 --> 00:28:36,568
Oh, this is incredible. I can't believe it.
I got everything I ever wanted.

336
00:28:37,009 --> 00:28:40,479
Yeah, Jenna, you got it all.
Congratulations.

337
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:44,567
It's your phone.

338
00:28:51,889 --> 00:28:54,084
- Hello?
- Hi, Gramercy calling to confirm...

339
00:28:54,249 --> 00:28:56,479
your limousine pickup
for 08:30 this evening.

340
00:28:56,649 --> 00:29:00,119
My...? Yes, my limousine for 8:30.

341
00:29:00,289 --> 00:29:02,644
I will be prepared to take
my ride at that time.

342
00:29:02,809 --> 00:29:04,845
Oh, can you tell me where
I'm going?

343
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:09,127
- The Palace, 27 Wall Street.
- Thank you.

344
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:12,645
I'm going to a party in a limo!

345
00:29:14,009 --> 00:29:17,638
Great. Looks like you're back to
your old self. I should probably go.

346
00:29:17,809 --> 00:29:21,040
- You don't wanna go to the party?
- No, I gotta work. Thanks.

347
00:29:21,209 --> 00:29:23,484
Shoot, I forgot you have a job.

348
00:29:23,649 --> 00:29:26,447
- It's kind of cool we both have jobs.
- Totally.

349
00:29:26,689 --> 00:29:30,921
Well, if you decide you want to come,
it's gonna be fun. 27 Wall Street.

350
00:29:31,089 --> 00:29:34,286
Okay, great. Thanks, Jenna.
Bye-bye.

351
00:29:34,929 --> 00:29:36,487
Matt.

352
00:29:37,529 --> 00:29:41,238
- Yeah.
- What if this isn't just a dream?

353
00:29:41,929 --> 00:29:44,966
What if what I wished for
actually happened?

354
00:29:45,809 --> 00:29:49,563
Then you got everything you ever
wanted. You might as well enjoy it.

355
00:29:50,849 --> 00:29:52,680
All right, Jenna.

356
00:29:57,569 --> 00:29:59,958
- Matty.
- Yeah.

357
00:30:00,729 --> 00:30:03,641
- Arrivederci.
- I'll see you.

358
00:30:03,809 --> 00:30:06,243
- Matt.
- Yeah.

359
00:30:07,609 --> 00:30:08,837
Au rev oir.

360
00:31:39,129 --> 00:31:42,724
- I'm Jenna, by the way.
- Yeah, I know. I'm Becky.

361
00:31:42,889 --> 00:31:44,845
How old are you, anyway?

362
00:31:45,009 --> 00:31:47,569
- Thirteen.
- Me too.

363
00:31:47,889 --> 00:31:49,880
Used to be.

364
00:31:52,849 --> 00:31:54,601
Why are you talking to me?

365
00:31:55,089 --> 00:31:58,923
- Why not? We are neighbours, right?
- But you usually ignore me.

366
00:32:01,609 --> 00:32:04,999
- I like your shoes.
- Thanks.

367
00:32:05,169 --> 00:32:06,397
I like your dress.

368
00:32:06,569 --> 00:32:09,925
It's because I've got these
incredible boobs to fill it out.

369
00:32:12,209 --> 00:32:13,688
- I like your bag.
- Thanks.

370
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:16,602
You should come by sometime.
I've got a zillion of them.

371
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:19,681
- Really?
- Yeah, it'd be totally cool.

372
00:32:19,849 --> 00:32:21,965
Hey, Becky?

373
00:32:22,129 --> 00:32:25,280
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah, sure.

374
00:32:25,449 --> 00:32:28,646
Can you tell I'm wearing underwear?
Because I totally am.

375
00:32:28,809 --> 00:32:32,199
I think that's kind of the point.

376
00:32:55,169 --> 00:32:57,922
Try it. It's soft-shell crab.

377
00:33:10,409 --> 00:33:11,888
Thanks.

378
00:33:24,529 --> 00:33:25,803
Hi, Tom-Tom.

379
00:33:25,969 --> 00:33:28,927
Oh, God, no one's called me that
since I had my nose job.

380
00:33:29,089 --> 00:33:31,887
- You had a nose job?
- Yeah, and yours is better.

381
00:33:32,049 --> 00:33:34,244
Anything to drink, ladies?

382
00:33:34,409 --> 00:33:38,118
- An apple Martini.
- Can I have a lemonade, please?

383
00:33:38,289 --> 00:33:42,248
Oh, wait. Make it
a piña colada, not virgin.

384
00:33:42,409 --> 00:33:44,525
Do you wanna see my ID?
Totally have it.

385
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,361
There you two are.

386
00:33:46,529 --> 00:33:49,282
Lucy, very nice.

387
00:33:49,449 --> 00:33:51,405
Sort of a dangerous mermaid look.

388
00:33:51,569 --> 00:33:54,447
And you... Barbie meets Britney.

389
00:33:54,609 --> 00:33:56,679
You look just
"scrum-didlee-umpcious"!

390
00:33:56,849 --> 00:33:58,680
I know. I mean, thank you.

391
00:33:58,849 --> 00:34:01,807
Everybody Wang Chung tonight,
right?

392
00:34:04,329 --> 00:34:06,206
Here you go.

393
00:34:09,729 --> 00:34:11,765
Thank you.

394
00:34:12,769 --> 00:34:15,408
- I'm sorry, it's late.
- We're keeping you up, are we?

395
00:34:15,569 --> 00:34:17,924
It's only 11:00. Stay a while.

396
00:34:25,049 --> 00:34:28,086
It's 11:00 on a school night,
and I'm at a party. It's so cool.

397
00:34:28,249 --> 00:34:31,719
It's 11:00 and people are leaving.
This is a disaster.

398
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:33,288
It is?

399
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:36,168
Speaking of disasters,
what is she doing here?

400
00:34:36,329 --> 00:34:38,604
- Who?
- Sparkle's editor in chief, Trish Sackett.

401
00:34:38,769 --> 00:34:41,203
Twelve o'clock and headed our way.

402
00:34:42,329 --> 00:34:46,561
Hi, girls. Our J. Lo issue is selling
like hotcakes. How's yours doing?

403
00:34:46,729 --> 00:34:50,642
My God, are things so bad you had
to come to our party to eat free food?

404
00:34:50,809 --> 00:34:52,765
Put some crab
in your purse for later.

405
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:56,444
You might want to keep some
of that biting wit for your magazine.

406
00:34:56,609 --> 00:34:59,646
Or you could change the name
to something more appropriate...

407
00:34:59,809 --> 00:35:03,961
like Poison or Pitiful.
Whatever's more pathetic.

408
00:35:04,129 --> 00:35:05,562
You know what?

409
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:10,723
You are rude and mean and sloppy
and frizzy. I don't like you at all.

410
00:35:11,089 --> 00:35:13,478
Well, fortunately,
I don't care about being liked.

411
00:35:13,649 --> 00:35:15,879
- I care about winning.
- This is delicious.

412
00:35:18,489 --> 00:35:20,241
Ladies.

413
00:35:26,409 --> 00:35:28,365
Do I smell?

414
00:35:28,529 --> 00:35:30,440
Do I have bad breath?

415
00:35:30,609 --> 00:35:35,205
- Am I malodorous in any way?
- No.

416
00:35:35,609 --> 00:35:38,999
People seem to be running for the exit
like someone set off a stink bomb.

417
00:35:39,169 --> 00:35:40,363
I don't smell anything.

418
00:35:40,529 --> 00:35:42,599
I think he means
the party is a stinker.

419
00:35:42,769 --> 00:35:47,081
A dud. A flop. A zero
on a scale of one to 10.

420
00:35:48,209 --> 00:35:50,120
Maybe if somebody
played something else.

421
00:35:50,289 --> 00:35:52,678
- Something with a melody.
- Play whatever you want.

422
00:35:52,849 --> 00:35:57,161
All I know is if those people don't
start dancing really, really soon...

423
00:35:58,209 --> 00:36:00,882
Here's to early retirement.

424
00:37:13,969 --> 00:37:15,800
Matty! Matty, come here.

425
00:37:16,689 --> 00:37:20,841
- Hey.
- Matty, come here.

426
00:37:21,009 --> 00:37:23,000
"Thriller." Matty.

427
00:37:23,169 --> 00:37:25,967
Me? No, no, no.
Take that thing away.

428
00:37:26,409 --> 00:37:29,003
- "Thriller." Come on.
- No way.

429
00:37:29,169 --> 00:37:31,000
Come on, man! Go!

430
00:37:31,729 --> 00:37:33,082
Jenna, no way.

431
00:37:33,249 --> 00:37:34,921
Come on, let's go.

432
00:37:35,089 --> 00:37:36,681
I don't remember those moves.

433
00:37:36,849 --> 00:37:40,364
I haven't done this in 15 years.
What are you, crazy?

434
00:37:46,969 --> 00:37:48,687
Tear it up, dude!

435
00:37:55,529 --> 00:37:57,724
- Come on, Matty.
- All right, all right.

436
00:38:01,049 --> 00:38:03,324
Okay, here we go.

437
00:38:19,169 --> 00:38:21,160
Go, Arlene!

438
00:38:26,009 --> 00:38:28,159
Come on, let's go!
Let's go, Jenna!

439
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:53,799
Go, Richard!

440
00:39:12,129 --> 00:39:15,246
- Jenna. I'm sorry, I gotta go.
- What do you...?

441
00:39:15,409 --> 00:39:17,877
- I'm sorry.
- Wait. Don't.

442
00:39:18,369 --> 00:39:20,166
Matt.

443
00:39:20,529 --> 00:39:23,726
Groove on, baby!

444
00:39:28,689 --> 00:39:31,078
I adore you!

445
00:39:53,169 --> 00:39:57,287
- Miss Rink! Miss Rink!
- Your credit card. Your credit card!

446
00:40:36,289 --> 00:40:38,644
- Thank you.
- To being 30.

447
00:40:38,809 --> 00:40:41,607
- I've decided it's gonna be awesome.
- Of course it is.

448
00:40:41,769 --> 00:40:45,000
You're thin, you're hot, you can
get any guy you want, "biatch."

449
00:40:45,169 --> 00:40:48,844
Not to mention, biatch, the hottest
magazine editor in the world.

450
00:40:49,009 --> 00:40:50,601
Second hottest.

451
00:40:51,249 --> 00:40:52,807
- Tied for first?
- Deal.

452
00:40:54,009 --> 00:40:56,239
And speaking of hot...

453
00:40:56,409 --> 00:41:00,322
Mr. Hotty behind you is totally
scamming on you right now.

454
00:41:09,609 --> 00:41:13,158
He is not. He's totally cute.

455
00:41:13,329 --> 00:41:15,968
- Should I go talk to him?
- You're not married.

456
00:41:19,929 --> 00:41:21,487
Good.

457
00:41:30,769 --> 00:41:32,282
Hi.

458
00:41:34,249 --> 00:41:36,444
Could I borrow your ketchup?

459
00:41:36,609 --> 00:41:38,201
Sure.

460
00:41:40,809 --> 00:41:43,164
I actually came over here...

461
00:41:43,329 --> 00:41:45,479
because I think you're really cute.

462
00:41:47,089 --> 00:41:51,002
- So do you wanna go out sometime?
- Yeah. Can you drive?

463
00:41:51,169 --> 00:41:54,957
Time to go. What, do you wanna
go to jail? I meant that guy.

464
00:41:55,129 --> 00:41:56,847
The man? Oh, gross.

465
00:41:57,489 --> 00:42:00,606
No more daiquiris for you tonight.

466
00:42:00,769 --> 00:42:03,488
You can never find a taxi
in this neighbourhood.

467
00:42:03,649 --> 00:42:06,209
Oh, my God. It's the naked man.

468
00:42:06,369 --> 00:42:08,724
- Hey, beautiful.
- He thinks I'm beautiful?

469
00:42:08,889 --> 00:42:13,121
- Well, he should. He's your boyfriend.
- My boyfriend?

470
00:42:14,809 --> 00:42:17,369
Why is that lady asking
for my boyfriend's autograph?

471
00:42:17,529 --> 00:42:18,757
Thank you so much.

472
00:42:18,929 --> 00:42:20,840
He may not be
the best New York Ranger...

473
00:42:21,009 --> 00:42:23,079
but he's the Ranger
with the best ass.

474
00:42:24,889 --> 00:42:26,117
Jenna?

475
00:42:26,729 --> 00:42:29,004
- Oh, my God. Matt. Hi!
- Hey.

476
00:42:29,809 --> 00:42:31,720
How are you?

477
00:42:32,329 --> 00:42:34,923
I'm sorry about the other night.

478
00:42:35,089 --> 00:42:38,445
- Beaver, is that you?
- Hey, Tom-Tom. How are you?

479
00:42:38,609 --> 00:42:40,645
You lost all your baby fat.

480
00:42:40,809 --> 00:42:44,438
- How does the Beave stay warm?
- Yeah, it's good to see you again too.

481
00:42:44,609 --> 00:42:47,203
I almost didn't recognize you.
Did you get a nose job?

482
00:42:47,369 --> 00:42:49,644
I can't believe you're here.
What are you doing?

483
00:42:49,809 --> 00:42:53,961
I'm... I'm actually... I'm doing
some shopping with my...

484
00:42:54,129 --> 00:42:56,279
Jenna, this is Wendy, my fiancée.

485
00:42:58,489 --> 00:43:00,127
- I'm Jenna.
- Matt told me all about...

486
00:43:00,289 --> 00:43:03,804
his blast from the past.
It was really sweet of you to stop by.

487
00:43:03,969 --> 00:43:07,041
Matty's the sweet one. I don't know
what I would've done without him.

488
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:09,882
- I'm sure you'll be fine.
- Are you a photographer too?

489
00:43:10,049 --> 00:43:12,722
I see you guys have spent
so much time talking about me.

490
00:43:12,889 --> 00:43:15,164
- Wendy's an anchorwoman.
- Anchorperson.

491
00:43:15,329 --> 00:43:18,002
I do the weather for WWEN
in Chicago.

492
00:43:18,169 --> 00:43:21,878
Matt and I were just talking about him
finally joining me in the Windy City.

493
00:43:23,409 --> 00:43:26,526
- You're moving to Chicago?
- We were just discu...

494
00:43:26,689 --> 00:43:28,919
We haven't really...
Is that Alex Carlson?

495
00:43:29,089 --> 00:43:31,808
Jenna, sorry. Sorry I'm late.

496
00:43:31,969 --> 00:43:33,243
Well, hi.

497
00:43:34,129 --> 00:43:35,801
- Hey. Who are you folks?
- Hey.

498
00:43:35,969 --> 00:43:39,325
I'm sorry. This is my good friend Matt
and this is his friend Wendy.

499
00:43:39,489 --> 00:43:45,325
- Fiancée.
- Right. So weird. And this is...

500
00:43:46,329 --> 00:43:49,719
You're Alex Carlson. Nice to meet you.
You're a great hockey player.

501
00:43:49,889 --> 00:43:51,322
- I'm a big fan.
- Thank you.

502
00:43:51,489 --> 00:43:55,801
You want me to sign your shirt or
your forehead? Now, I don't do butts.

503
00:43:56,849 --> 00:43:58,202
I'm just joshing you. Sorry.

504
00:43:58,369 --> 00:44:02,282
I crack a lot of jokes after we win,
on account of I'm in such a good mood.

505
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:08,001
Okay, well, we should
probably get going.

506
00:44:08,169 --> 00:44:10,558
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to see you folks.

507
00:44:10,729 --> 00:44:13,721
Nice to see you folks. Bye.

508
00:44:17,329 --> 00:44:19,638
You mind if I steal her
from you for the night?

509
00:44:19,929 --> 00:44:22,762
Nope. I had my eye on
something a little better inside...

510
00:44:22,929 --> 00:44:26,285
so I'll see you guys later.
Have a good night.

511
00:44:26,449 --> 00:44:29,043
Excuse me one second. Lucy?

512
00:44:30,929 --> 00:44:33,284
Should I go to his place alone?

513
00:44:33,449 --> 00:44:37,522
Yeah. Why not?
Go play. You deserve it.

514
00:44:37,689 --> 00:44:40,408
Play. You mean
like games and stuff?

515
00:44:40,569 --> 00:44:46,724
Yeah, games. All kinds of games.

516
00:44:58,609 --> 00:45:00,839
I couldn't wait to see you tonight.

517
00:45:02,129 --> 00:45:03,926
You wanna play a game?

518
00:45:04,089 --> 00:45:07,001
- Do you have Battleship?
- Yeah, I have Battleship.

519
00:45:07,169 --> 00:45:09,967
I'll show you my destroyer.

520
00:45:10,129 --> 00:45:13,804
- I call the red board.
- Well, I call the blue board.

521
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:23,721
What?

522
00:45:28,049 --> 00:45:30,927
Okay. I know. I forgot.

523
00:45:33,409 --> 00:45:35,479
I owe you one raunchy striptease.

524
00:45:45,849 --> 00:45:47,407
Oh, God.

525
00:45:48,209 --> 00:45:50,518
Oh, gross.

526
00:45:56,209 --> 00:46:01,567
Who's got the moves
on the ice and off the ice, ice, baby?

527
00:46:01,729 --> 00:46:05,881
Wait! Wait! Wait! I don't wanna see
that thing again. Put it away.

528
00:46:06,049 --> 00:46:07,801
Put it away!

529
00:46:07,969 --> 00:46:09,925
God.

530
00:46:15,249 --> 00:46:19,083
We can play Monopoly!
We can play Parcheesi!

531
00:46:20,169 --> 00:46:22,683
He didn't have Battleship.
He didn't have any games.

532
00:46:22,849 --> 00:46:24,328
Boys are so stupid.

533
00:46:24,489 --> 00:46:27,083
Becky, it's even worse
than you think.

534
00:46:27,249 --> 00:46:29,763
How come the ones
that you like never like you?

535
00:46:29,929 --> 00:46:34,002
Well, you have to fight for what
you want. Rule number one:

536
00:46:34,169 --> 00:46:36,364
Love is a battlefield.

537
00:46:36,529 --> 00:46:40,488
That's deep. Really deep.

538
00:46:40,649 --> 00:46:44,244
- Good luck with fractions.
- Have fun at work.

539
00:46:45,889 --> 00:46:47,880
To the office, Tom.

540
00:46:49,809 --> 00:46:52,328
"Fifty-seven ways to have an orgasm."

541
00:46:52,329 --> 00:46:53,809
"Fifty-seven ways to have an orgasm."

542
00:46:54,209 --> 00:46:57,679
- I didn't know there were 57.
- "Touch-her-there underwear."

543
00:46:57,849 --> 00:46:59,965
No.

544
00:47:00,129 --> 00:47:02,438
"He loves you, but..."

545
00:47:02,609 --> 00:47:04,884
- "He loves your butt."
- Yes.

546
00:47:05,049 --> 00:47:07,688
- " He lies, he cheats...
- So typical.

547
00:47:07,849 --> 00:47:10,647
What are you doing wrong?"

548
00:47:14,489 --> 00:47:18,721
There's no easy way of saying this,
so I'm just gonna come out with it.

549
00:47:20,849 --> 00:47:24,319
The circs are in.
Our numbers are dismal.

550
00:47:24,489 --> 00:47:29,643
We're below 600,000 total circulation.
Sparkle is closing in on a million.

551
00:47:29,809 --> 00:47:35,645
I've come off the phone with corporate,
and they have dropped the R word.

552
00:47:35,809 --> 00:47:37,845
Redesign?

553
00:47:38,009 --> 00:47:39,806
Redesign Poise?

554
00:47:39,969 --> 00:47:42,437
Wait. Sparkle copies everything
we come up with...

555
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:44,725
and we have to redesign?
That's bullshit.

556
00:47:44,889 --> 00:47:50,600
Well, either we redesign and bring up
our numbers, or they pull the plug.

557
00:47:50,769 --> 00:47:52,999
Richard, redesign is a death sentence.

558
00:47:53,169 --> 00:47:56,844
No, it's not. It's a chance
to have some fun.

559
00:47:57,329 --> 00:48:01,959
Let Sparkle have all our
secondhand, stale, grody ideas.

560
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:04,723
We'll open up the F.O.B.,
overhaul the B.O.B.

561
00:48:04,889 --> 00:48:07,881
It's time for us to prove
we have some poise left.

562
00:48:08,049 --> 00:48:12,839
Well, I shall be leaving it
to my dynamic duo...

563
00:48:13,009 --> 00:48:15,398
to come up with something
utterly fabulous.

564
00:48:17,009 --> 00:48:21,560
We have two weeks,
four hours and 30 minutes.

565
00:48:22,209 --> 00:48:25,167
- I have your urgent messages.
- Let's hear them.

566
00:48:25,329 --> 00:48:27,445
Well, okay.

567
00:48:27,609 --> 00:48:30,203
Emily Pratt called
and wanted me to tell you:

568
00:48:30,369 --> 00:48:34,078
"I can't believe you scooped my story
on Vivienne Tam, you backbiting bitch.

569
00:48:34,249 --> 00:48:36,399
That was a new level
of sleaze, even for you.

570
00:48:36,569 --> 00:48:38,799
I hope you die in one
of her casual pantsuits."

571
00:48:38,969 --> 00:48:41,847
Oh, my God, that was so mean.

572
00:48:42,009 --> 00:48:46,082
Miss Lewis called. She said,
"I hope you choke on your own bile...

573
00:48:46,249 --> 00:48:50,037
you pretentious, conniving snake."

574
00:48:50,209 --> 00:48:52,359
- Maybe I should read them myself.
- Good.

575
00:48:52,529 --> 00:48:54,918
Oh, great.

576
00:48:58,929 --> 00:49:01,807
- Miss Rink's line.
- Put that little bitch on the phone now.

577
00:49:01,969 --> 00:49:04,642
Please don't take that tone.
I'm just her assistant.

578
00:49:04,809 --> 00:49:05,958
Tell her to call Todd.

579
00:49:07,169 --> 00:49:12,197
"Sweet bottom, you seem uptight.
Let me come over and give you my..."

580
00:49:20,049 --> 00:49:22,722
- Yes.
- Alex is on line one, Miss Rink.

581
00:49:22,889 --> 00:49:26,564
Oh, gag me. Can you
please tell him I'm busy?

582
00:49:26,729 --> 00:49:30,278
Okay, but he wants to know
what time would be good for dinner.

583
00:49:30,449 --> 00:49:33,725
How about in 10 zillion years?
Ask him how that works.

584
00:49:33,889 --> 00:49:37,006
- Okay, I'll ask.
- Okay.

585
00:49:41,009 --> 00:49:43,079
- Yeah?
- I'm sorry to bother you again.

586
00:49:43,249 --> 00:49:45,479
- Pete Hansen is here to see you.
- Who?

587
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:48,800
Tracy from the
art department's husband.

588
00:49:49,369 --> 00:49:51,599
Oh, okay. Sure.

589
00:50:01,769 --> 00:50:06,126
I was just dropping off Tracy's lunch,
thought I'd say hello.

590
00:50:08,569 --> 00:50:11,720
You brought Tracy her lunch?
That's so sw...

591
00:50:14,849 --> 00:50:16,840
What are you doing?

592
00:50:17,009 --> 00:50:18,681
What's wrong, pooky?

593
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,487
"Pooky"?

594
00:50:20,649 --> 00:50:24,039
Pukey. You're married,
and to a girl I work with.

595
00:50:24,209 --> 00:50:27,884
Well, that didn't stop us from rattling
some desk drawers loose last week.

596
00:50:28,289 --> 00:50:32,202
So come on.
Lie down and take a memo.

597
00:50:40,449 --> 00:50:44,328
Listen, hire the best photographer,
and I don't want Jenna to find out.

598
00:50:44,489 --> 00:50:46,400
- No. Roger that.
- Okay?

599
00:50:46,569 --> 00:50:50,357
God, what is up with her lately,
anyway? I mean, she seems so lost.

600
00:50:50,529 --> 00:50:53,839
I have no idea. I'm getting
so sick of having her around...

601
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:56,204
with this crazy new act
she has going on.

602
00:50:56,369 --> 00:50:59,327
You know how she stole
Charlotte's idea and then fired her?

603
00:50:59,489 --> 00:51:01,684
I say we go ahead
with our own presentation...

604
00:51:01,849 --> 00:51:03,567
and let her fall on her ass.

605
00:51:03,729 --> 00:51:05,845
Oh, God, yeah.

606
00:51:35,889 --> 00:51:38,357
Okay, you're not Cajun.

607
00:51:40,169 --> 00:51:43,241
- Wanna go for a walk?
- Sure.

608
00:51:50,369 --> 00:51:52,519
I still can't believe
you're getting married.

609
00:51:52,689 --> 00:51:55,408
In two weeks.

610
00:51:57,889 --> 00:52:00,687
Is she your soul mate, Wendy?

611
00:52:01,649 --> 00:52:06,564
My soul mate? I don't know if I believe
in those. I think that's kind of naive.

612
00:52:07,089 --> 00:52:10,968
But you get goose bumps
when you're around her...

613
00:52:11,129 --> 00:52:13,085
and butterflies?

614
00:52:13,249 --> 00:52:18,118
No, I haven't gotten crazy like that
about a girl since high school.

615
00:52:18,729 --> 00:52:20,640
Matty.

616
00:52:23,129 --> 00:52:25,518
What...? What happened to us?

617
00:52:25,689 --> 00:52:28,044
I mean, how come
we never stayed friends?

618
00:52:30,289 --> 00:52:32,086
I don't know. I forget.

619
00:52:32,249 --> 00:52:34,558
No, what happened?

620
00:52:35,889 --> 00:52:39,279
I don't know. I can pretty much
peg it to your 13th birthday party...

621
00:52:39,449 --> 00:52:41,963
when you were playing that game.
Spin the Rapist?

622
00:52:42,129 --> 00:52:44,199
Seven Minutes in Heaven.
Everybody ditched.

623
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:46,599
And that is the last thing I remember.

624
00:52:47,569 --> 00:52:50,129
We don't have to get into this.
It's a long time ago.

625
00:52:50,289 --> 00:52:53,167
- It really doesn't matter anymore.
- It matters to me.

626
00:52:53,329 --> 00:52:55,206
Just tell me.

627
00:52:58,329 --> 00:52:59,842
You came out of the closet...

628
00:53:00,009 --> 00:53:03,206
and I started to sing
my birthday song to you.

629
00:53:03,369 --> 00:53:06,281
And then you picked up
and threw at me...

630
00:53:06,449 --> 00:53:08,360
with impressive force, I might add...

631
00:53:08,529 --> 00:53:11,839
the dream house that I spent
three weeks building for you.

632
00:53:12,009 --> 00:53:15,046
And then you just stopped
being my friend...

633
00:53:15,209 --> 00:53:18,918
and you never spoke to me
again after that, ever.

634
00:53:22,289 --> 00:53:24,359
I'm so sorry.

635
00:53:24,929 --> 00:53:27,841
Forget it, Jenna. It was a long
time ago. It doesn't matter.

636
00:53:28,009 --> 00:53:31,399
Matt, stop being so nice to me.
I don't deserve it.

637
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:34,920
Do you know what
kind of person I am now?

638
00:53:35,089 --> 00:53:37,922
Do you know who I am right now? I...

639
00:53:40,009 --> 00:53:42,728
I don't have any real friends. I...

640
00:53:42,889 --> 00:53:45,687
I did something bad
with a married guy.

641
00:53:45,849 --> 00:53:48,682
I don't talk to my mom and dad.

642
00:53:49,449 --> 00:53:52,327
I'm not a nice person.
And the thing is...

643
00:53:53,809 --> 00:53:55,879
I’m not 13 anymore.

644
00:54:00,249 --> 00:54:02,046
Jenna.

645
00:54:17,889 --> 00:54:19,720
Behind you.

646
00:55:49,209 --> 00:55:51,882
Oh, it's good to be home.

647
00:56:01,049 --> 00:56:02,801
- Daddy.
- Jenna?

648
00:56:02,969 --> 00:56:05,324
What in the world?

649
00:56:06,209 --> 00:56:08,120
- Sweetheart.
- I missed you guys so much.

650
00:56:08,289 --> 00:56:10,598
Are you all right?

651
00:57:11,889 --> 00:57:14,039
Mom.

652
00:57:14,649 --> 00:57:17,482
Do you ever wish you could go back...

653
00:57:17,649 --> 00:57:19,241
like to another time?

654
00:57:19,409 --> 00:57:22,640
I wouldn't mind giving back
some of these wrinkles.

655
00:57:23,569 --> 00:57:25,480
Okay.

656
00:57:26,369 --> 00:57:31,318
If you were given one do-over,
anything in your life, what would it be?

657
00:57:37,249 --> 00:57:38,921
Nothing.

658
00:57:39,089 --> 00:57:42,001
- Really?
- Really.

659
00:57:42,169 --> 00:57:44,558
But did you ever make
a big mistake?

660
00:57:44,729 --> 00:57:48,085
Or a huge one that could
change your life? What about that?

661
00:57:48,249 --> 00:57:50,888
Well, Jenna, I know
I made a lot of mistakes...

662
00:57:51,049 --> 00:57:53,483
but I don't regret
making any of them.

663
00:57:54,169 --> 00:57:55,488
How come?

664
00:57:56,249 --> 00:57:58,205
Because if I hadn't have
made them...

665
00:57:58,369 --> 00:58:01,167
I wouldn't have learned
how to make things right.

666
00:58:09,329 --> 00:58:12,048
I'm sorry I missed last Christmas.

667
00:58:51,289 --> 00:58:53,678
Carrie, I'm heading out, okay?

668
00:58:56,329 --> 00:58:58,126
I'm so exhausted.

669
00:58:58,289 --> 00:59:00,041
- Jenna's working late.
- She has been.

670
00:59:10,409 --> 00:59:12,320
- Hey.
- Hey.

671
00:59:12,489 --> 00:59:16,004
I was gonna stop by your office.
I tried to call you a bunch of times.

672
00:59:16,169 --> 00:59:19,957
- I didn't get any messages.
- I was in a hurry.

673
00:59:20,129 --> 00:59:22,279
But I did try to reach you.

674
00:59:22,449 --> 00:59:26,601
I actually wanted to talk to you
about this whole redesign thing.

675
00:59:26,769 --> 00:59:30,045
I hope you don't mind, but I've been
working on something on my own.

676
00:59:30,209 --> 00:59:32,882
It's really last-minute.

677
00:59:33,049 --> 00:59:36,598
- I hope you don't mind.
- No, of course not...

678
00:59:36,769 --> 00:59:39,124
because I'm doing the same thing.

679
00:59:50,889 --> 00:59:54,040
- Hey, Jenna.
- Hey.

680
00:59:54,209 --> 00:59:56,962
Someone's got
a big photo shoot going on.

681
00:59:57,129 --> 00:59:58,767
- Yeah.
- What's happening?

682
00:59:58,929 --> 01:00:01,727
- Did you bring them?
- Oh, yeah, I got a few.

683
01:00:02,529 --> 01:00:04,281
- What are you doing?
- I'm hiring you.

684
01:00:04,449 --> 01:00:07,521
Actually, Poise
is hiring you for the week.

685
01:00:08,049 --> 01:00:09,846
Here.

686
01:00:16,409 --> 01:00:18,923
This is the first half.
The rest when we finish.

687
01:00:19,089 --> 01:00:22,286
I could really use this, but you
don't need to do me any favours.

688
01:00:22,449 --> 01:00:25,441
I'm asking you to do me a favour.
I love your work.

689
01:00:26,449 --> 01:00:28,121
I hope you'll do this with me.

690
01:00:30,569 --> 01:00:35,404
You know, I've seen your magazine.
My stuff is not your style at all.

691
01:00:37,609 --> 01:00:39,565
Exactly.

692
01:00:40,569 --> 01:00:42,878
Who gets Francis?

693
01:00:43,409 --> 01:00:46,446
There we go.
Okay, let's do it.

694
01:00:46,609 --> 01:00:48,725
Up, up!

695
01:00:48,889 --> 01:00:51,483
- Okay, everybody.
- Okay, everybody, climb up there.

696
01:00:51,649 --> 01:00:53,321
Lots of energy.

697
01:00:53,489 --> 01:00:56,765
- All right. Nice. You're the real deal.
- Keep up the flag.

698
01:00:56,929 --> 01:01:00,888
All right. Jenna, this is
your class of 2004.

699
01:01:01,049 --> 01:01:03,244
All right, guys. Ready?

700
01:01:13,249 --> 01:01:16,207
Very good. Very good.

701
01:02:40,049 --> 01:02:42,643
- They're beautiful.
- Yeah, they came out okay, huh?

702
01:02:42,809 --> 01:02:44,128
- I think so.
- Yeah.

703
01:02:44,289 --> 01:02:46,803
- Do you?
- I do, yeah.

704
01:02:55,369 --> 01:02:57,599
Yeah, it's getting late.
I should get home.

705
01:02:57,769 --> 01:02:59,760
It's getting pretty late here.

706
01:02:59,929 --> 01:03:02,807
You know what I wish I had
right now?

707
01:03:02,969 --> 01:03:04,687
No, what?

708
01:03:04,849 --> 01:03:06,840
Razzles.

709
01:03:07,009 --> 01:03:08,965
Razzles?

710
01:03:09,129 --> 01:03:12,360
I haven't had Razzles...

711
01:03:13,369 --> 01:03:15,121
in 15 years.
Remember...

712
01:03:15,289 --> 01:03:17,962
they're both a candy and a gum.
That's incredible.

713
01:03:18,129 --> 01:03:21,246
I can't believe they had them.
Okay, don't waste a minute.

714
01:03:21,409 --> 01:03:24,242
It's been a long time. Careful.

715
01:03:25,649 --> 01:03:27,241
Yeah.

716
01:03:29,529 --> 01:03:31,281
What are you laughing at?

717
01:03:31,449 --> 01:03:32,962
I don't know.

718
01:03:33,129 --> 01:03:37,008
Life. Timing. Being here with you,
eating Razzles.

719
01:03:41,489 --> 01:03:44,287
I've had a really great time
working with you this week.

720
01:03:44,449 --> 01:03:45,677
- Me too.
- And everything.

721
01:03:45,849 --> 01:03:47,407
Yeah.

722
01:03:49,529 --> 01:03:51,042
Hey, Matty.

723
01:03:52,129 --> 01:03:54,279
Tell me something.

724
01:03:54,449 --> 01:03:56,485
What colour is my tongue?

725
01:03:56,649 --> 01:03:58,799
- What?
- What colour is my tongue?

726
01:03:58,969 --> 01:04:00,846
It's red. I don't know. Red.

727
01:04:01,009 --> 01:04:03,079
"Red" red? Or tongue red?

728
01:04:03,689 --> 01:04:05,407
Razzle red.

729
01:04:05,569 --> 01:04:07,002
- Show me yours.
- What?

730
01:04:07,169 --> 01:04:09,922
- Your tongue. I showed you mine.
- I'm not showing you.

731
01:04:10,089 --> 01:04:12,045
Show me your tongue.
I showed you mine.

732
01:04:12,209 --> 01:04:15,246
- I didn't ask to see yours.
- Matty, I need to see your tongue.

733
01:04:17,569 --> 01:04:19,525
Razzle red.

734
01:04:23,009 --> 01:04:24,840
You wanna know a secret?

735
01:04:26,049 --> 01:04:27,846
Yeah.

736
01:04:28,009 --> 01:04:30,239
You're the sweetest guy
I've ever known.

737
01:04:35,009 --> 01:04:37,079
I bet I can still beat you off the jump.

738
01:04:40,729 --> 01:04:43,163
Whoever goes the furthest,
the other owes a drink.

739
01:04:43,329 --> 01:04:45,399
- An Orange Julius.
- Upping the stakes.

740
01:04:45,569 --> 01:04:48,527
And dinner Friday night at 8:00...

741
01:04:48,689 --> 01:04:51,044
at the 24th Street Diner...

742
01:04:51,209 --> 01:04:53,643
to celebrate our redesign
being chosen.

743
01:04:53,809 --> 01:04:56,004
Deal. One.

744
01:04:57,889 --> 01:04:59,880
- Two.
- Two.

745
01:05:00,849 --> 01:05:02,487
- Three!
- Three!

746
01:05:05,489 --> 01:05:06,842
Are you okay?

747
01:05:07,009 --> 01:05:09,045
I should've tucked and rolled.

748
01:05:09,209 --> 01:05:10,767
I'm getting old.

749
01:05:10,929 --> 01:05:12,840
No, you're not,
because that means I am.

750
01:05:13,009 --> 01:05:14,408
Well?

751
01:05:20,369 --> 01:05:21,643
- Hey.
- Yeah?

752
01:05:21,809 --> 01:05:23,686
You got arm hair.

753
01:05:25,249 --> 01:05:27,717
It's never quite got
that reaction before.

754
01:06:00,009 --> 01:06:02,000
It was like it wasn't even me.

755
01:06:02,169 --> 01:06:04,046
Like I had just...

756
01:06:04,209 --> 01:06:07,406
watched us down below, kissing.

757
01:06:08,849 --> 01:06:11,488
Then I just floated home on a cloud.

758
01:06:13,689 --> 01:06:16,044
That is so romantic.

759
01:06:19,369 --> 01:06:21,405
- Look.
- You've got goose bumps.

760
01:06:21,569 --> 01:06:24,083
I totally know. They won't go away.

761
01:06:24,929 --> 01:06:26,408
Do you love him?

762
01:06:26,569 --> 01:06:28,366
Duh.

763
01:06:29,009 --> 01:06:30,681
When will you see him again?

764
01:06:30,849 --> 01:06:33,317
I don't know, actually.
I don't know if I can.

765
01:06:33,489 --> 01:06:36,686
- What? Why?
- It's complicated.

766
01:06:36,849 --> 01:06:38,885
It's a grownup thing.

767
01:06:40,089 --> 01:06:42,967
Well, at least you have
someone to dream about.

768
01:06:43,129 --> 01:06:45,962
Guys don't wanna jump your bones
when you're a metal-mouth.

769
01:06:46,129 --> 01:06:49,087
What is that attitude?
We are young.

770
01:06:50,049 --> 01:06:53,758
Heartache to heartache, we stand.

771
01:06:53,929 --> 01:06:57,239
Love is a battlefield.

772
01:07:29,009 --> 01:07:31,728
But I like it like this,
with freckle girl and the dog.

773
01:07:32,529 --> 01:07:35,407
- These photos are unbelievable, Jen.
- Okay, here's the dog.

774
01:07:35,569 --> 01:07:38,163
- Francis is the dog's name.
- Okay. What do you think?

775
01:07:38,329 --> 01:07:42,607
Well, I think I'm gonna start reading
Poise for the first time in my life.

776
01:07:58,529 --> 01:08:01,089
No, I got a place I rent in Brooklyn.

777
01:08:01,489 --> 01:08:05,801
That'll work? All right,
I'll see you then. Bye-bye.

778
01:08:09,649 --> 01:08:13,324
Hey. I wasn't expecting to see you...

779
01:08:13,489 --> 01:08:16,162
Wendy. I thought you were
flying in tomorrow.

780
01:08:16,329 --> 01:08:18,797
What, are you expecting
someone else?

781
01:08:19,569 --> 01:08:20,763
No. Hi.

782
01:08:20,929 --> 01:08:22,760
I wanna take you to lunch. Hungry?

783
01:08:22,929 --> 01:08:26,205
Yeah, yeah. What a surprise.

784
01:08:26,369 --> 01:08:27,882
Okay, where do you?

785
01:08:28,049 --> 01:08:30,279
- How was your flight?
- It was good.

786
01:08:30,449 --> 01:08:33,168
You can take pictures of
vitamin bottles anywhere.

787
01:08:33,329 --> 01:08:36,401
And I was just thinking that we
should try to resolve this now.

788
01:08:36,569 --> 01:08:41,324
Instead of being a commuter couple
during our first year of marriage.

789
01:08:42,929 --> 01:08:44,567
What?

790
01:08:44,729 --> 01:08:46,606
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

791
01:08:46,769 --> 01:08:49,237
Could you? I missed that.

792
01:08:50,449 --> 01:08:52,485
- Arlene, do you have any more...?
- Jenna.

793
01:08:53,049 --> 01:08:55,802
My balls, excuse my French,
are in an iron vice.

794
01:08:55,969 --> 01:08:59,564
Corporate are twisting like a bunch
of dominatrixes on steroids.

795
01:08:59,729 --> 01:09:02,926
Now Lucy's presenting her own
redesign. Tell me what's going on.

796
01:09:03,089 --> 01:09:05,398
What is going on is you
will have more choices.

797
01:09:05,569 --> 01:09:09,323
All respect to Lucy, I'm more anxious
to know what you're working on.

798
01:09:09,489 --> 01:09:11,400
- Thank you.
- I'm not complimenting you...

799
01:09:11,569 --> 01:09:13,082
I’m trying to pressure you.

800
01:09:13,249 --> 01:09:15,888
How long until your balls
get totally squished?

801
01:09:16,049 --> 01:09:18,768
Hopefully never. I'm really rather
attached to my balls.

802
01:09:18,929 --> 01:09:20,840
Can they hang in there till 5?

803
01:09:21,689 --> 01:09:23,884
Jenna, you are not yourself
at the moment.

804
01:09:24,049 --> 01:09:28,201
Since when do you keep me out of
the loop? I'm really freaking out here.

805
01:09:28,369 --> 01:09:31,122
- The rest of the prints are ready.
- Goody. Hang in there.

806
01:09:31,289 --> 01:09:33,166
Why does nobody listen
to a word I say?

807
01:09:33,329 --> 01:09:35,638
Arlene, aren't you coming?

808
01:09:35,809 --> 01:09:39,085
Oh, you're invited, are you?
Okay, bye-bye.

809
01:09:39,249 --> 01:09:41,638
Oh, no, excuse me.
Go ahead.

810
01:09:42,529 --> 01:09:44,406
You know, what am I?
I'm just the...

811
01:09:44,569 --> 01:09:48,198
editor in chief. Whatever.

812
01:09:48,369 --> 01:09:52,521
We've gotta go to 23rd, please,
between 5th and 6th.

813
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:56,045
- It's 29 West 23rd.
- You got it, lady.

814
01:09:56,209 --> 01:09:58,728
The new and improved Poise
will explore the last frontier.

815
01:09:58,729 --> 01:10:01,368
The new and improved Poise
will explore the last frontier.

816
01:10:01,529 --> 01:10:04,043
It will go heroin chic one better.

817
01:10:04,209 --> 01:10:05,722
It will OD.

818
01:10:05,889 --> 01:10:08,562
It will kill.

819
01:10:08,729 --> 01:10:11,766
Cause of death? Chicness.

820
01:10:11,929 --> 01:10:17,049
The new Poise will go farther than
any fashion magazine ever before.

821
01:10:17,209 --> 01:10:20,201
It will be deadly serious.

822
01:10:20,369 --> 01:10:22,803
Fashion suicide.

823
01:10:26,369 --> 01:10:28,360
So, what do you think?

824
01:10:38,289 --> 01:10:39,722
Thank you, sir.

825
01:10:39,889 --> 01:10:42,562
- How much time do we have?
- We have two minutes. Hurry.

826
01:10:48,529 --> 01:10:50,599
Jeez. Such a bitch.

827
01:10:59,729 --> 01:11:01,640
I know this is different.

828
01:11:01,809 --> 01:11:04,323
I mean, from anything
we've ever done.

829
01:11:04,489 --> 01:11:08,960
And I know you might hate it
and think I'm completely crazy.

830
01:11:09,929 --> 01:11:12,523
But I won't care, even if I get fired.

831
01:11:12,689 --> 01:11:17,319
And I don't mean that disrespectfully,
it's just that I've realized something.

832
01:11:19,409 --> 01:11:21,479
Who are these women?

833
01:11:21,649 --> 01:11:23,287
Does anyone know?

834
01:11:23,449 --> 01:11:25,917
I don't recognize any of them.

835
01:11:30,609 --> 01:11:32,600
I wanna see...

836
01:11:32,769 --> 01:11:35,761
my best friend's big sister...

837
01:11:37,609 --> 01:11:40,169
and the girls from the
soccer team.

838
01:11:40,689 --> 01:11:42,759
My next-door neighbour.

839
01:11:42,929 --> 01:11:46,126
Real women who are smart and pretty
and happy to be who they are.

840
01:11:46,289 --> 01:11:48,644
These are the women
to look up to.

841
01:11:53,329 --> 01:11:56,366
Let's put life back
into the magazine.

842
01:11:57,409 --> 01:12:00,958
And fun and laughter and silliness.

843
01:12:02,129 --> 01:12:06,884
I think we all... I think all of us
wanna feel something...

844
01:12:07,889 --> 01:12:11,086
that we've forgotten
or turned our backs on.

845
01:12:11,969 --> 01:12:16,042
Because maybe we didn't realize
how much we were leaving behind.

846
01:12:22,289 --> 01:12:25,440
We need to remember
what used to be good.

847
01:12:32,209 --> 01:12:34,086
If we don't...

848
01:12:34,249 --> 01:12:38,037
we won't recognize it
even if it hits us between the eyes.

849
01:12:41,329 --> 01:12:43,081
I just...

850
01:12:46,169 --> 01:12:48,524
Bravo!

851
01:12:52,529 --> 01:12:54,918
Brilliant.

852
01:12:56,809 --> 01:13:01,246
We will present this to corporate
first thing tomorrow morning.

853
01:13:05,569 --> 01:13:09,164
- So who's this mystery photographer?
- Matt Flamhaff.

854
01:13:09,329 --> 01:13:11,160
Is he Arthur or Martha?

855
01:13:11,329 --> 01:13:12,921
Matt. He's Matt.

856
01:13:13,089 --> 01:13:16,479
No, no. Is he gay?

857
01:13:16,649 --> 01:13:18,924
Are you gay?

858
01:14:26,329 --> 01:14:28,206
- City and listing?
- Manhattan.

859
01:14:28,369 --> 01:14:31,361
Sparkle magazine on Park Avenue.

860
01:14:32,209 --> 01:14:34,769
- Sparkle magazine.
- Trish Sackett, please.

861
01:14:47,409 --> 01:14:51,527
Jenna, I'm sorry to barge in on you like
this, but I really have to talk to you...

862
01:14:51,689 --> 01:14:54,123
Hey, Beaver.

863
01:14:54,289 --> 01:14:56,849
I mean Matt. I'm sorry.

864
01:14:57,009 --> 01:14:58,442
Old habits die hard, you know.

865
01:14:58,609 --> 01:14:59,837
Fine. Is Jenna around?

866
01:15:00,009 --> 01:15:03,240
Are you here about your photos?

867
01:15:03,929 --> 01:15:06,523
No, actually, I'm not.

868
01:15:06,689 --> 01:15:08,680
I guess I should just tell you...

869
01:15:08,849 --> 01:15:11,966
that Jenna's decided to go
in a different direction...

870
01:15:12,129 --> 01:15:16,168
with a more established
photographer.

871
01:15:16,329 --> 01:15:21,801
She's gonna use the guy who shoots
the official photos of her sweetie pie.

872
01:15:21,969 --> 01:15:25,405
So don't take it personally,
because there's just a little bias.

873
01:15:25,569 --> 01:15:29,005
I'm sorry to be so honest
with you, because...

874
01:15:29,169 --> 01:15:31,729
I think your pictures
are really cute.

875
01:15:31,889 --> 01:15:33,607
It was nice talking to you.

876
01:15:33,769 --> 01:15:37,318
Hey, Matt. While I've got you here,
do you wanna sign a general release?

877
01:15:37,489 --> 01:15:39,719
Maybe we can use your
pictures in a catalogue.

878
01:15:39,889 --> 01:15:41,607
Fine.

879
01:16:41,249 --> 01:16:42,443
Hi.

880
01:16:42,609 --> 01:16:45,646
- Jenny, right?
- Jenna.

881
01:16:46,609 --> 01:16:47,803
I was looking for Matt.

882
01:16:47,969 --> 01:16:51,200
I wanted to tell him some really great
news about his photographs.

883
01:16:51,369 --> 01:16:52,518
Everybody loved them.

884
01:16:52,689 --> 01:16:56,318
That's great. I'll tell him when he gets
back. He's out getting his tux.

885
01:16:56,489 --> 01:16:59,128
- His tux?
- I know. Men.

886
01:16:59,289 --> 01:17:00,961
Everything's the last minute.

887
01:17:01,129 --> 01:17:03,404
I mean, hello. We're getting
married tomorrow.

888
01:17:03,569 --> 01:17:07,767
This'll be the cutest little backyard
wedding since I don't know when.

889
01:17:07,969 --> 01:17:10,767
- Congratulations.
- Thanks. I'll tell Matt you stopped by.

890
01:17:10,929 --> 01:17:13,045
- Okay.
- Bye.

891
01:17:22,569 --> 01:17:26,721
We wanna feel something
again that we've forgotten.

892
01:17:26,889 --> 01:17:30,120
Because we didn't stop to notice
how much we were leaving behind.

893
01:17:30,929 --> 01:17:34,160
We need to remember
what used to be good.

894
01:17:37,969 --> 01:17:39,197
You ready?

895
01:17:41,169 --> 01:17:43,000
The meeting's cancelled, Jenna.

896
01:17:43,169 --> 01:17:44,727
What, until tomorrow?

897
01:17:44,889 --> 01:17:46,288
It's over.

898
01:17:47,889 --> 01:17:49,447
It's over?

899
01:17:50,609 --> 01:17:52,486
Lucy...

900
01:17:52,649 --> 01:17:55,721
She took all your designs
to Sparkle. Everything.

901
01:17:55,889 --> 01:17:57,845
She's their new editor in chief.

902
01:17:58,049 --> 01:18:00,483
Your photos showed up
in Sparkle Online last night.

903
01:18:00,649 --> 01:18:02,287
They're in outdoor ads everywhere.

904
01:18:02,449 --> 01:18:04,519
She can't take Matt's pictures.
Those belong to us.

905
01:18:04,689 --> 01:18:07,806
- She can't do it!
- She can, and she is.

906
01:18:07,969 --> 01:18:10,358
She got him to sign this.

907
01:18:16,569 --> 01:18:18,127
Lucy, you stole Matt's pictures.

908
01:18:18,609 --> 01:18:21,760
Oh, which one do you wanna be
today, the pot or the kettle?

909
01:18:21,929 --> 01:18:23,920
If you don't mind,
I'd like to be the pot.

910
01:18:24,089 --> 01:18:27,001
Maybe the kettle. It doesn't really
matter. They're both black.

911
01:18:27,169 --> 01:18:30,559
- What are you talking about?
- I found this in your office yesterday.

912
01:18:30,729 --> 01:18:33,084
Does it look familiar?
It has your name on it.

913
01:18:33,249 --> 01:18:36,241
- You went through my things?
- Oh, give me a break.

914
01:18:36,409 --> 01:18:38,969
How horrible. How terrible.
I can't believe I did it.

915
01:18:39,129 --> 01:18:40,528
What is this?

916
01:18:40,689 --> 01:18:43,567
You can wipe off the " Bambi
watching her mother get shot...

917
01:18:43,729 --> 01:18:46,527
and strapped to the back of
a van" look from your face.

918
01:18:46,689 --> 01:18:48,680
I talked to Trish Sackett yesterday.

919
01:18:48,849 --> 01:18:51,807
It's okay, Jenna. I know all
about your little deal.

920
01:18:51,969 --> 01:18:53,880
It's a sweet little deal, actually.

921
01:18:54,049 --> 01:18:56,643
Editor in chief if you help them
hit a million copies?

922
01:18:56,809 --> 01:18:58,606
- So you'd give them tips.
- Oh, my God.

923
01:18:58,769 --> 01:19:02,478
Not bad. I just wish I would
have thought of it.

924
01:19:02,649 --> 01:19:05,322
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

925
01:19:05,489 --> 01:19:08,526
Only, now I'm taking your job,
you stay here with the magazine...

926
01:19:08,689 --> 01:19:10,680
you single-handedly flushed
down the toilet.

927
01:19:11,129 --> 01:19:12,608
What about Matt?

928
01:19:12,769 --> 01:19:15,044
Why did he sign this?
What did you say to him?

929
01:19:15,209 --> 01:19:17,279
Let's see. I think that I told him...

930
01:19:17,449 --> 01:19:20,202
you had decided to go
in a different direction.

931
01:19:20,569 --> 01:19:22,287
Which you are now.

932
01:19:24,289 --> 01:19:29,124
I might have told him something else,
too, but I just can't remember.

933
01:20:38,729 --> 01:20:42,358
George Washington Bridge,
New Jersey.

934
01:20:53,169 --> 01:20:54,443
Jenna.

935
01:20:54,609 --> 01:20:57,328
- Jenna Rink.
- Yeah?

936
01:20:57,489 --> 01:20:59,798
Chris Grandy.

937
01:20:59,969 --> 01:21:01,960
So, what are you doing?
Are you married?

938
01:21:02,129 --> 01:21:05,644
Because if you're single,
I definitely want a number.

939
01:21:05,809 --> 01:21:07,037
We could get together.

940
01:21:07,209 --> 01:21:08,847
I'm still living at home...

941
01:21:09,009 --> 01:21:10,965
- Come on, Grandy! Come on.
- Holy Christ!

942
01:21:11,129 --> 01:21:15,247
This is the tune we first
tangled tongues to.

943
01:21:15,409 --> 01:21:17,639
What's the dude who sings this?

944
01:21:17,809 --> 01:21:21,006
- Rick Springsteen.
- It's Springfield, Grandy.

945
01:21:21,169 --> 01:21:22,761
I'm out of here.

946
01:21:22,929 --> 01:21:26,239
I thought you wanted my number.

947
01:21:49,769 --> 01:21:51,566
I'll take these.

948
01:21:53,489 --> 01:21:54,842
Good afternoon.

949
01:21:56,969 --> 01:21:58,163
You remember, Wayne.

950
01:21:58,329 --> 01:22:01,799
It was with the Flamhaffs
at San Ysidro Ranch.

951
01:22:01,969 --> 01:22:04,608
San Ysidro Ranch.

952
01:22:05,249 --> 01:22:09,527
It's so pretty. It's perfect.
It looks great.

953
01:22:23,449 --> 01:22:25,599
Hi.

954
01:22:25,769 --> 01:22:27,282
Hey.

955
01:22:32,849 --> 01:22:36,603
I don't know what Lucy said to you
about me, but I want you to know...

956
01:22:36,769 --> 01:22:39,522
that whoever that was she
was talking about...

957
01:22:40,289 --> 01:22:42,245
wasn't me.

958
01:22:44,809 --> 01:22:46,401
It doesn't matter what Lucy said.

959
01:22:46,569 --> 01:22:50,198
I stopped trusting her after she stole
my Pop Rocks in the third grade.

960
01:22:52,009 --> 01:22:53,647
Matt.

961
01:22:55,529 --> 01:23:00,683
I am not the awful person
that I know that I was.

962
01:23:00,849 --> 01:23:03,044
I don't even know that person.

963
01:23:04,489 --> 01:23:07,003
And I'd like to believe...

964
01:23:07,169 --> 01:23:10,718
I have to believe
that if you knew that...

965
01:23:10,889 --> 01:23:14,768
if in your heart, you really,
really knew that...

966
01:23:15,889 --> 01:23:18,483
you wouldn't be getting ready
to marry someone now.

967
01:23:18,649 --> 01:23:22,198
Unless that someone were me.

968
01:23:34,169 --> 01:23:37,844
Jenna, I'm not gonna lie to you.

969
01:23:40,289 --> 01:23:42,678
I have felt things...

970
01:23:42,849 --> 01:23:45,044
these past few weeks...

971
01:23:46,129 --> 01:23:49,326
that I didn't know I could
feel anymore.

972
01:23:50,249 --> 01:23:54,037
But I have realized
in these past few days...

973
01:23:56,009 --> 01:23:59,081
you can't just turn back time.

974
01:24:00,609 --> 01:24:02,884
Why not?

975
01:24:03,049 --> 01:24:04,607
I moved on.

976
01:24:04,769 --> 01:24:06,122
You moved on.

977
01:24:06,449 --> 01:24:09,566
We've gone down different paths
for so long.

978
01:24:09,729 --> 01:24:12,323
We made choices.

979
01:24:12,489 --> 01:24:15,208
I chose Wendy.

980
01:24:16,969 --> 01:24:19,642
That's her family down there.

981
01:24:20,209 --> 01:24:22,769
We care about each other,
you know?

982
01:24:24,529 --> 01:24:28,841
You don't always get the dream
house, but you get awfully close.

983
01:24:32,649 --> 01:24:34,879
Please don't cry, Jenna.

984
01:24:35,049 --> 01:24:37,802
Oh, I'll be fine, I promise.

985
01:25:06,929 --> 01:25:08,885
Matty, can I have it?

986
01:25:09,049 --> 01:25:10,641
Please?

987
01:25:10,809 --> 01:25:13,004
- You're not gonna whip it at me?
- No.

988
01:25:20,369 --> 01:25:23,566
Look, I won't have you be late.
Just go.

989
01:25:24,009 --> 01:25:27,319
Go on. I'm fine. I'm just crying
because I'm happy.

990
01:25:27,489 --> 01:25:30,447
I want you to be so, so happy.

991
01:25:32,849 --> 01:25:34,919
I love you, Matt.

992
01:25:38,129 --> 01:25:39,847
You're my best friend.

993
01:25:42,369 --> 01:25:44,439
Jenna, I...

994
01:25:45,569 --> 01:25:48,003
I've always loved you.

995
01:27:45,409 --> 01:27:48,207
Jenna's waiting for you in the closet.

996
01:27:58,809 --> 01:28:00,606
Matty.

997
01:28:07,249 --> 01:28:09,444
You really know what you're doing.

998
01:28:09,849 --> 01:28:12,124
Come on.

999
01:28:13,209 --> 01:28:15,848
- Sorry, I forgot my scarf.
- You know what?

1000
01:28:16,009 --> 01:28:20,002
You can be the pot and kettle
all by yourself from now on, biatch.

1001
01:28:20,169 --> 01:28:21,522
Come on, Matt.

1002
01:28:21,689 --> 01:28:23,839
- What did you call me?
- We're gonna be late.

1003
01:28:24,009 --> 01:28:25,806
- For what?
- You'll see.

1004
01:29:17,129 --> 01:29:18,926
A Razzle, Mr. Flamhaff?

1005
01:29:19,089 --> 01:29:21,364
Thank you, Mrs. Flamhaff.

1006
01:33:43,609 --> 01:33:45,600
