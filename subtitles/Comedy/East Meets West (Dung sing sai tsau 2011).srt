00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,279
In 2011, a scientist from
the University of Cambridge

2
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,749
William Tunstall-Pendoe

3
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,598
input over 3 hundred million pieces of data

4
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,916
into a supercomputer

5
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,430
in order to determine the precise date

6
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,073
of the single least meaningful day of
the last century

7
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,876
it was a peaceful day, with not much
happening of international import

8
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,352
except that by some strange coincidence
I managed to be born

9
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,239
I've been spending over 30 years

10
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,914
ignorantly passing through this tunnel called life

11
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,598
I see the same people every time when I get drunk

12
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,028
they tell me to get out of this tunnel
as soon as possible

13
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,958
and go to see the outside world

14
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,069
I'm Sammi

15
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,073
I do makeup for the dead

16
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,076
What

17
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,678
Fortunately modern Chinese culture

18
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,432
still has room for shrimp dumplings and shaomai

19
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,995
When I see them together, inseparable

20
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,270
I can't help but think of Romeo and Juliet

21
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,629
Iove and hate mixing together

22
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,352
So powerful!

23
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,114
20 please, Miss

24
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,555
20 my ass, never paid more than 14

25
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,319
Well here's a discounted package for you then

26
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,397
It's a set menu. Night Lovers For Two

27
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,999
When shrimp dumplings meets shaomai

28
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,991
on this honeymoon banana split

29
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,354
the original price was 26.8

30
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,915
now it's only 20 for you
because fate had us meet here

31
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,873
I didn't ask for a banana split

32
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,271
Miss, this banana is mine

33
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,994
Please get a new bag of shaomai for this lady

34
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,151
It's quarter to midnight

35
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,629
only 1 5 minutes to March 1st

36
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,795
that's when these shaomai expire

37
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,953
fate doesn't have to be decided by god

Hey Miss, don't leave yet

44
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,518
You really need our service

45
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,396
You know why?.

46
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,556
take a look, according to our database

47
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,672
the women who come to convenience stores

48
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,398
...are sad, why?.

49
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,874
They must be workaholics

50
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,519
- Of course not
- Well, even worse

51
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,795
no boyfriends taking care of you

52
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,636
it's ok to refuse me

53
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,836
but don't refuse fate

54
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,918

- Hey Hey!
- don't follow me

58
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,592
You're a pro, perfect!

59
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,591
don't move! freeze!

60
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,789
What are you doing?.

61
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,792
Let me check you out first

62
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,711
I just want to see if it's love at first sight

63
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,194
According to the theory of

64
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,157
the psychologist professor Pandora from Harvard

65
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,355
the first time two people meet

66
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,028
if one's body temperature stays
a constant 38.6 degrees Centigrade

67
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,078
there is an 80% probability of love at first sight

68
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:50,911
bullshit

69
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,712
I don't believe in either love or marriage

70
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,517
Well said

71
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,557
Having sex without love,
living together without marriage

72
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,709
Either is ok with me

73
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,676
Alright?.

74
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,558
Hello? what's wrong dad?

75
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,991
Huh? Shenzhen?

76
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,709
What are you doing in Shenzhen?

77
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,109
Just watching her move

78
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,510
I can tell she's no ordinary woman

79
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,235
what's more she absolutely is no ordinary woman

Look at your dead looking face,
goofing around your whole life

84
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,675
What goofing around?.

85
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,118
It's my job to be a zombie

86
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,430
You called me urgently yesterday

87
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,390
I called back but your phone was off

88
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,828
I called your home and no one answered

89
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,633
Have a little common sense

90
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,158
I'm up to my ears in debt,
how can I turn on my cellphone?

91
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,157
You're kidding me?. you're in debt again?

92
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,992
Not me this time, it's your mother

93
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,878
I'm sorry, it's stepmother

94

We broke up seven times within two years

95
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,390
It's getting hard to keep her in line

96
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,430
Harder than raising a daughter

97
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,117
You deserve it

98
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,554
She is the most vain of all my classmates

99
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,357
and you picked her?

100
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,039
if you hadn't called her up to fix the computer

101
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,876
how was I supposed to make her your mom?

102
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,790
I didn't call her

103
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,949
I called her boyfriend Tommy

104
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,155
and she invited herself

105
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,630
What are you reading uncle?

106
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,876
Horse Racing Tips

107
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,391
Those tips are a scam

Here's my tips for you

109
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,558
I'm off now uncle

110
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,549
Scarlet, where are you going?

111
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,755
Back to home to wait for a call

112
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,035
Wait for me

113
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,716
ok! I'm going to Betting Center

114
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,676
Wait

115
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,230
What is it?.

116
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,388
Race 2, 3 hooks 38, 90, 12

117
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,598
What's Scarlet running away from this time?.

118
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,390
She promised a businessman Charles from Guangzhou

119
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,713
to hold The Wynners' 38th anniversary concert

120
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,836
and already spent the 500 thousand deposit

121
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,116
Just have the uncles come out for help

122
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,231
Hey! aren't you supposed to
scare people as a zombie?.

123
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,230
You can't just stand around

124
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,519
Jeez! You scared the shit outta me!

125
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,552
You think I didn't call them?

126
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,518
they all have work to do

127
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,870
That's right,

128
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,598
I just can't understand
why every one from the Wynners has work

129
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,636
only you could end up like this

130
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,712
What? Like what?
at least I stand on my own two feet

131
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,590
Being a zombie is
a perfectly respectable occupation

132
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,155
I beat three students from Hong Kong University

133
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,793
when I had my interview

134
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,758
I didn't scare those last two guys,
I'll try harder next time

135
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,155
Is there any point so low that
I haven't seen it with my own two eyes

136
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,319
and yet with millions of
Hong Kong citizens watching me

137
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,794
I can't make a single wrong move

138
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,791
for fear that I would let them down

139

140
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,197
Hello!

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,793
Is Bee with you?.

142
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,993
Scarlet you stupid bitch

143
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,317
Not answering Mr Charles's call?
where's your wife?

144
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,875
Stop! freeze!

145
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,678
- You're at Art Capital?
- Ah!! Go!

146
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,599
Tell your dad to meet me

147
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,597
Art Capital

148
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,948
Was it Scarlet?

149
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,793
Yes! said she found knock off Wynners

150
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,790
Jump...

151
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,436
What are you doing?

152
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,353
They told us to jump

153
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,790
Who?

154
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,278
Roger. The fourth bird from the side

155
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,238
next to her is his cousin Elaine

156
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,237
My God, you understand bird talk now

157
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,793
Yes, I do understand

158
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,712
It's been happening a lot recently

159
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,199
Get them back to see Mr Charles

160
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,554
Yes! Don't say I didn't warn you

161
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,598
Wow! I can't believe we survived the fall

162
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,715
It's God's will that
I go to Guangzhou to chop that bitch

163
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,596
They are down there

164
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,759
The birds are pecking them

165
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,519
It's mutation of bird flu Dad

166
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,955
Thank you Roger

167
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,079
Daughter, I've heard there are lots of singers

168
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,153
staying in Art Capital hoping to be discovered

169
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,637
Well, your wife is "lucky" this time,
let me tell you

170
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,915
I'm here to chop her up

171
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,752
I'm heading back to Hong Kong
after I'm done! Got me?

172
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,911
No way! If we could just handle this concert

173
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,513
I could turn over a new leaf

174
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,314
What if those knock off Wynners get popular

175
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,959
I am their manager

176
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,158
Art Capital, please

177
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,676
Megan, here's my chance

178
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,118
If I become an actor
I could finally get close to you

179
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,596
Roger

180
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,559
I am Wen from Foshan

181
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,793
I graduated from the movie Yip Man
and the sequel

182
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,430
Hey Driver

183
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,153
Don't drive so Donnie Yen

184
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,349
Just a little more Lynn Xiong please

185
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,356
Hey!

186
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,430
We have no money

187
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,675
but talent and strong will

188
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,989
I am a policeman

189
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,590
weeding out the bad and
protecting the good is my sworn duty

190
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,874
It's Method Acting

191
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,595
I just turned Yip Man into a policeman

192
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,189
using only my imagination and a gun

193
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,391
but his name is still Yip Man

194
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,829
Fantastic

195
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,149
Well, I'll give you a chance

196
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,515
Alright, character, role, personality?

197
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,630
taxi driver

198
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,953
Ok! sit tight

199
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,069
This is crazy, does he has driving license?

200
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:17,917
...You two talent scouts, I could take on

201
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,751
it's just like flying a plane!

202
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,750
...ten Donnie Yens!

203
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,272
What are you doing?

204
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,749
I'm looking for singers, not circus performers

205
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,237
dad

206
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,189
What do you want?

207
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,309
I'm looking for my wife

208
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,796
Scarlet

209
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,592
What you said has inspired me

210
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,795
I'll sing a song for you

211
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,428
You are not the only singer here, I can sing too

212
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,517
manager

213
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,075
Go

214
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,279
Miss Jade! Miss Jade!

215
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,236
It's too dangerous here

216
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,516
they're just jealous of your music talent

217
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,959
why don't we just go home?.

218
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,640
I scarred my face and ran away from home

219
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,279
you think I'm an idiot?.

220
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,958
OK, dad would make me to be his CEO if I go back

221
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,588
but now I just need those two managers
to give me a chance

222
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,510
I want to sing

223
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,789
Bravo

224
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,552
why don't we invite managers home

225
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,188
then talk about the details?.

226
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,516
home my ass

227
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,114
hello, My Dear Lord, how are you

228
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,236
I almost persuaded her to come home

229
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,320
I am Noah and this is my ark

230
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,994
we are family from now on

231
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,036
and your business is mine

232
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,315
and my business is yours

233
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,393
don't go manager!

234
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,829
come on! come on!

235
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,068
hurry up dad, we're running out of time!

236
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,309
Bing, hold me tight

237
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,677
Yes, and you hold me tight too, Miss

238
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,394
guys I just wrote a song

239
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,238
it's called Don't Be Jealous of My Talent,
wanna hear it?.

240
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:16,832
not necessary

241
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,228
- Hello
- help me

242
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,118
where are you honey?. we are at Art Capital

243
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,555
you son of a bitch, you are a good troublemaker
and a great swindler

244
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,311
but not much of a wife

245
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,236
your husband got his ass kicked because of you

246
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,868
son of a bitch, how could those bastards find me

247
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,632
if you didn't lose the phone?.

248
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,109
bitch, I'm looking for my husband,
it's none of your fucking business

249
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,036
where the hell are you?.
I'm coming over to chop you up now

250
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,750
hey, be quiet, where are you?.

251
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,512
she's at Shengshi Financial Center

252
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,756
see me at 9AM if you don't want anything to
happen to your wife

253
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,910
who are you?.

254
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,637
I'm Charles

255
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,995
the boss who was cheated out of
500'000 by your wife

256
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,794
you leave her alone

257
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,310
excuse me, you two are scouts

258
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,635
or gangsters?.

259
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,309
they look like scouts, actually they are gangsters

260
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,159
this character has so many levels

261
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,277
I'm following the right person, bro

262
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,828
I'll drive you to chop...

263
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,519
there's a man!

264
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,511
about to crash!

265
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,556
dad

266
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,397
We can't find your mom, kid

267
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,191
I'm not surprised

268
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,835
hurry up

269
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,310
I can't imagine what that
Charles could do to Scarlet

270
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,919
why are you caring about her so much?.

271
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:35,996
when we see Charles later

272
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,639
we have to make the first move, stun him first

273
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,749
Xiaofang

274
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,750
it's a miracle

275
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,356
it can't be explained

276
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,670
I'm telling you

277
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,596
I've never believed in miracles

278
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,353
your father was dead

279
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,672
but somehow he came back to life again

280
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,353
I can't accept this

281
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,950
to prove that there are no miracles

282
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,190
I'm asking your dad to jump off the rooftop

283
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,190
OK?.

284
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,238
If he survives this, I'm a believer

285
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,038
dad

286
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,757
I'm warning you! I'll be really angry

287
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,638
if you push me away again next time

288
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,394
""dad almost killed you by not paying
attention""

289
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,999
"I saw a woman just looking like your mom,""

290
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,833
""so I lost my mind and ran out to the street""

291
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,992
"I was trying to get you
a new record on your video game""

292
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,995
"but I didn't only lose the game
I deleted your save as well"

293
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:46,830
"I'm so useless, no wonder your
mom left me"

294
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,430
it's not true

295
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,552
you transformed into superman when you hit the car

296
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,069
"you read too many comics"

297
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,389
it's not like that

298
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,634
I'm a run-away, I can't give you my address

299
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,155
are you on twitter?. Email?.

300
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,833
and them too

301
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,718
a man and a lady

302
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,836
both flew out of the car

303
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,116
and transformed into super heroes

304
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,557
Listen, Xiaofang...

305
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,829
Every time the Eight Heavenly Dragons
return to the mortal world

306
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,036
there is always a witness

307
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,995
since the Dragons lose their memory
from previous lives

308
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,837
you will be the one to pass
their secrets on in this life

309
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:44,078
At the beginning of the world,
humans were good by nature

310
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,558
so God sent the Eight Heavenly Dragons
to the mortal world

311
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,790
to protect mankind from turning to evil

312
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,908
but one of the Dragons called Yaksha

313
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:57,198
couldn't resist the pleasures of the mortal world

314
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,076
he killed the other seven Dragons

315
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,913
before they even knew what was happening

316
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,631
but Yaksha only destroyed their physical bodies

317
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,030
he couldn't destroy their souls

318
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,555
so they returned once every generation

319
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,395
to fight with Yaksha for revenge

320
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,957
unfortunately they lost every time

321
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,951
I hope in this life they can find a way
to dissolve this hatred

322
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,190
and the eight of them could reunite once again

323
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:30,228
and carry out the mission of
guiding the mortals to the path of goodness

324
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,312
finally he said bye bye to me, and that was it

325
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,279
did you record it on your cell phone?.

326
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,029
I want to post it on twitter for Megan Fox

327
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,953
No! he said this was confidential

328
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,678
he couldn't get involved

329
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,431
damn!

330
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,554
this crazy boy is bullshit!

331
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,996
their story truly inspired me

332
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,115
Bing, guitar

333
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,633
this song is called My Talent is Bullshit

334
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,078
how great a father's love is

335
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,749
hello?. Dear Lord Father

336
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:12,556
Yes! Yes! I've successfully
convinced her to come home

337
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,111
See you then, bye-bye

338
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,514
You two, you guys knocked her out

339
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,630
Yes

340
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,034
A-men

341
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,591
Hey, kid, you have quite the imagination

342
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,718
you should be an actor!
He's so good at making things up

343
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,189
you should encourage him to be a scriptwriter.
Such a waste

344
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,113
think about it, what kind of a dad are you?.

345
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,277
dad, he doesn't believe me

346
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,508
"stop lying"

347
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,069
even you don't believe me?. I'm not speaking to you

348
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,794
""reported this morning-""

349
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,552
""six miraculously survive car crash-
more on A4"

350
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,273
I can come up to talk to you today

351
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,358
it means we are brave and determined

352
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,030
Well! In a word,
I'll return the half million deposit

353
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,519
in five years

354
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,671
otherwise we die together...!

355
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,235
OK, you need time to think about it

356
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,559
I count down from five. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

357
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,709
it's a deal sweetie

358
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,233
sweetie my ass

359
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,118
you are Mr. Charles now, not my dad

360
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,952
could you try getting into character?.

361
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,073
whatever

362
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,835
you really think this'll work?.

363
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,353
it works every time

364
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,754
didn't you lose your tour guide license

365
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,114
Iast time you tried to intimidate

366
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,599
your customers into shopping

367
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,234
no one would marry a woman like you

368
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,392
give me break, I don't believe in love or marriage

369
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,753
Mr. Charles is waiting for you two

370
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,951
Whatever, I'm not scared of you

371
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,955
he didn't follow the rules, he attacked us first

372
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,996
He thought he could get the upper hand
by striking the first blow

373
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,559
He will know the meaning of badass

374
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,791
William Shakespeare used to say

375
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,838
during difficult times

376
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,156
one can tell the real character of a person

377
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,788
today you dare come talk to me with empty hands

378
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,831
it shows bravery and determination

379
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,792
it proves sincerity and willpower

380
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,357
in a word, get me the million in five days

381
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,111
what?. isn't it half a million?.

382
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,636
I know, a million, you need time to think about it

383
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:03,153
5, 4, 3, 2...

384
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,070
dad?.

385
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,915
a pro is a pro

386
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,872
you can give two people a haircut at the same time

387
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,077
but why did you give me a Beatles cut?.

388
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,074
I used to be a hairstylist ten years ago

389
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,673
everything I have now

390
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,876
I got from a pair of scissors

391
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,596
I'm an expert at everything,
finance, real estate, trade

392
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,359
I want to try my hand at entertainment this year,

393
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,152
my first case is The Wynners

394
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,399
and you're telling me it can't be done?.

395
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,390
I'll lose my reputation if people find out

396
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,191
my stocks will plummet

397
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,269
Mr. Charles, it's not that
we don't care about your reputation

398
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,839
I did ask my old buddies

399
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,877
they are really not available, I tried my best

400
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:41,836
did you?.

401
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,989
- honey!
- Scarlet!

402
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,312
I spent all the money

403
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,512
there's still a handbag I didn't pay for

404
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,551
I know you need time to think about it

405
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,832
One second, OK or not?.

406
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,276
OK!

407
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,796
Let her go

408
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,029
Yes, boss

409
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,951
didn't you say you came to chop me?.

410
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,634
birthday cake?.

411
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:39,756
son of a...

412
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,434
Iet's celebrate our getting back together
for the seventh time

413
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,277
bastard

414
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,158
surprised me every...

415
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,190
time

416
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,992
I did want to chop you up, bitch

417
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,269
but the cake saved you

418
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,671
Ha...

419
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,149
surprised me again

420
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,237
surprised me too, if it wasn't for getting you out

421
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,750
I never would have promised
Charles to manage this concert

422
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,319
I am doomed this time

423
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,071
don't worry, one must bear
the consequences of their own actions

424
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,992
the worst thing is to be sold as a prostitute

425
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,709
plastic surgery, breast enlargement
will help get a good price

426
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,154
but I don't want to sell you

427
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:16,752
sell me?.

428
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,432
aren't we talking about her?.

429
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,996
- you bitch! fuck you!
- Peace, peace, peace

430
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,792
somebody call the police

431
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,435
Lord will out in 1 5 minutes

432
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,277
get the car ready, over!

433
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:25,997
Copy!

434
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:33,831
Lord

435
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:38,431
Bing, ask Miss Jade if she'd rather
study medicine in the US or

436
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,199
study law in Britain?.

437
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,075
Miss, My Lord has compromised already

438
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,151
you don't have to be CEO of the company

439
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,278
he only begged you to go to college,
please show some respect

440
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,712
did I ask you to beg her?.

441
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,672
Iove well, hate well

442
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:03,196
I completely felt your fatherly love from the slap

443
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,712
but did you feel

444
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,269
any filial affection from the back of my head?.

445
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,236
Get out

446
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,150
OK

447
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,636
I am fine

448
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,396
it was fine to make mistakes when you were younger

449
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:31,279
now you're grown up,
you can't make any wrong moves

450
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,912
wasting youth is a huge mistake,
one you have to recognize

451
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,878
you always make the others apologize

452
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,152
which woman were you with

453
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,958
the night my mother died?.

454
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,949
considering my social position now

455
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,189
I don't have to apologize to anybody

456
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,594
apologize for what?.

457
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:57,237
I feed a lot of people

458
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,396
I contribute to this family

459
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,830
and this society! I'm not like you

460
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,076
you are still wearing your dead mom's crappy scarf

461
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,878
playing that crappy music

462
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,350
daughters always belong to others, My Lord

463
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,312
don't worry My Lord, I'm with you

464
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,112
I will be tough and mature

465
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,236
have you thought about adopting me?.

466
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,158
what the hell are you talking about?.

467
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,751
Only if I lost this unfilial daughter

468
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,512
Oh, I see My Lord

469
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,631
We are getting in the car

470
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:32,990
OK

471
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,831
- what are you doing?.
- get in or I'll kill you

472
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,152
dad, Ah!

473
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:45,877
you

474
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,594
don't blame me

475
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,758
The Lord asked me to do this

476
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,628
Ah...! what are you doing?. Ah...

477
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,513
Oh My God

478
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,997
that kid's heavenly dragon story is true

479
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,753
Miss, I spent days and nights

480
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,878
thinking of ways to make you transform

481
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,638
and came up with this idea

482
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,068
it was to stab you

483
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,872
and it worked

484
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,433
what did you do?.

485
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:36,200
Yeah, I think it would work on you too

486
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,994
where are you taking me?.

487
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,240
scared?. you'll be free once we get the ransom

488
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,794
the money is not a problem
as long as you let me go

489
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,595
a ghost

490
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,116
Ieave me alone! what do you want from me?.

491
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,390
what are you scared of?.
I thought you were fearless?.

492
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,715
beat me

493
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,715
I'm warning you

494
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,071
don't you ever stop your daughter
from playing music,

495
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,355
you hear me?.

496
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,349
no matter how much money you have,

497
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,630
no matter how many people
you take care of out there

498
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,592
you have never taken care of you family

499
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,239
including the woman standing behind you

500
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,073
that makes whatever
you've done out there meaningless

501
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,276
You heard so many women saying they loved you

502
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:01,514
but have you ever said that to the woman you loved

503
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,556
You selfish bastard!

504
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,632
it's easy to lose one's temper
after a transformation

505
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,279
don't blame her, bye!

506
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,639
I did exactly the same thing as the others

507
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,279
how come I transformed into a one armed swordsman?.

508
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,789
even worse...a lefty

509
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,310
Cousin

510
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,829
Cousin Da Xiong

511
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,158
A Qiao knows you've been upset ever
since you two separated

512
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,958
So we came by to visit you

513
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,990
Why don't you just move out
since you are not happy here

514
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:07,389
"Move out?. I don't have any other
place to live"

515
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,836
Just rent his place

516
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,399
that way it's easier for you
to take care of Xiaofang

517
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,158
And my three daughters as well

518
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,709
Then he can focus on taking care of me

519
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,874
"Where can I get money for the rent?. "

520
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:24,033
Here! I bought some contracts from the usury

521
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,794
You'll get your money once you sign these papers

522
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,877
just sign it, make it simple!

523
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,110
I can't be your wife

524
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,113
but it's fate I become your landlady

525
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,236
Sign here

526
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:40,918
Here, sign here, and here, here you are

527
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,879
dad! dad!

528
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,676
"Why did you get into a fight?. ""

529
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,877
The kids at school beat me up
because I said you were Superman

530
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:10,796
Su...

531
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,949
Superman?.

532
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,753
Stop with the nonsense, Xiaofang

533
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,639
I'm not lying, my dad is Superman

534
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:28,391
Right! He's not lying. I'm telling you

535
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,631
his dad is a Superman

536
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,359
Kid, I'm with you

537
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,190
Let's find the taxi driver Wen right now

538
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,512
How are you?. Are you alright?.

539
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,990
You did this?. are you the driver?.

540
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:11,990
I remember your license plate

541
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:15,516
Your pained reactions

542
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,432
need some levels. You didn't show it

543
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:18,755
And...your blood

544
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,195
as for the blood, you should be spouting

545
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,315
Really?.

546
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,514
Are you getting paid for

547
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:30,908
all of this teaching you're doing?.

548
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:33,510
Horsy

549
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,875
Just exchanging some acting tricks,
and who are you?.

550
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,196
I cover this area

551
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,999
for extorting money. Got a problem?.

552
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,118
No problem, very clear, no problem

553
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,275
Wen

554
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,919
My friend is calling me, I'm off

555
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,830
Ok! I know this place very well,
let's see how far you can go

556
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:53,995
What's up?.

557
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,515
Do you remember him?.

558
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,071
Of course, the great screenwriter

559
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,755
We truly are gods...

560
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,632
What?. no kidding?.

561
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,079
- Shhh!
- Why are you dressed like this?.

562
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,196
So they can't recognize me

563
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,239
You stupid bitch

564
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,674
trust me, you are not going anywhere

565
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,076
dad, sneaking out like this isn't your style

566
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,231
Scarlet must have forced you

567
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,789
You bitch...Shh!

568
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,756
Shh!

569
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,350
I'm part of this, I'm an accomplice

570
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,956
dad, you gave him your word

571
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,912
you keep saying millions of Hong Kong citizens
are watching you

572
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,513
how can you break your promise

573
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,989
what's the big deal with Charles

574
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:09,193
if you and I work together and put on a great show

575
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,039
then we can settle down

576
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,595
huh?. immigrate to Guangzhou?.

577
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,717
She blinked! damn it

578
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,110
What?.

579
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,153
Her eyes are blinking

580
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,509
What are you doing?.

581
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,433
Every time she cheated on exams,
played hooky, lied

582
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:24,958
she never blinked before

583
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,553
she is blinking now

584
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,709
What are you trying to say?.

585
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,036
She wants to stay and seduce Charles

586
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,350
Impossible! no one knows her better than I do

587
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,160
she doesn't believe in love and marriage

588
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,795
I'm sorry

589
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,274
I had the wrong reaction

590
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:46,432
My baby! I'm so happy you found Mr. Right

591
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,074
but I can't find the Wynners

592
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,276
Don't worry, dad, it's enough to have you

593
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,953
and we can find people to fake the other four

594
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,757
fake?.

595
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,672
Hmm! Well. This concert

596
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,236
is going to have a theme, Wynners in Space

597
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,150
so everyone needs a mask

598
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,514
how can the audience tell the difference?.

599
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,717
Ha...! You think the audience
is as easy to fool as your dad

600
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,189
We can tell the audience that
the climax of the concert

1270
01:36:30,986 --> 01:37:20,536
Repair and Synchronization by
<i><font color=yellow> Syful Noa Bluebiru </font></i>

601
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,510
is to have those spacemen take their masks off

602
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,796
and you take off first, dad,
and then the other four

603
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,995
once they take their masks off

604
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,515
I'll cut the power and set fire to
the stage, start chaos

605
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,433
After the concert is over,
Charles has nothing to say

606
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,235
Good idea

607
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,670
Get to the point

608
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,112
Hey...!

609
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:28,871
Right

610
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,549
The point is that I want to
get a chance to meet Charles

611
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,791
a Harvard psychology professor once said

612
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,149
if a man and a woman stay in a room alone

613
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,117
and their body temperature stays at 38.6
degrees Centigrade

614
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,191
there will be an 80% probability of
love at first sight

615
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,920
Dad, you've got to help me

616
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,719
It's not that I don't want to help you

617
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,918
but we don't have enough people
to fake the Wynners

618
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:11,836
Manager

619
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,077
You have to believe we all are supermen

620
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,678
and space supermen

621
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,309
It's God's will

622
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,990
Yeah!

623
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,231
Boss, why the Wynners?.

624
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,753
aren't they too retro?.

625
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,349
We are making a good image for Shengshi stock

626
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,879
nostalgia is the mainstream

627
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,036
to support a Wynners concert

628
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,077
will help build a positive image, understand?.

629
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:42,509
We want our money back!

630
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,430
Get away!

631
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,117
Boss!

632
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,999
Mr. Charles, let's shake hands, best of luck

633
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,315
but we will succeed even without shaking hands

634
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,669
Excuse me, Bee

635
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,117
how can you go to the concert with that haircut?.

636
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,317
I'll just put on a wig and
be as handsome as I used to be

637
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,112
You've got to be kidding

638
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,391
What are you up to?.

639
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,715
I'm up to the things that I do

640
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,676
before I know what you're up to

641
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,796
Good! I like cautious man

642
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,836
so what are you up to exactly?.

643
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,796
You cut my hair the other day

644
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,796
I thought you...you know...me

645
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,956
so I want to check your body temperature.
According to what...

646
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,792
the Harvard psychology professor,
Pandora once said

647
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,109
if a man and woman stay in a room alone

648
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,998
and their body temperature stays a constant 38.6
degrees Centigrade

649
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,913
the probability of love at first sight will be 80%

650
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,750
So...

651
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:44,870
you really fell for me...

652
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,758
fifteen years ago before I became a barber

653
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:47,750
I lead the life of an intellectual

654
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,717
I worked my way through Harvard's
Psychology Program through correspondence

655
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:52,553
Love at 38.6 Degree

656
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,358
was the essay I wrote for the entrance exam

657
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,033
Pandora is my pen name

658
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,155
and I made it all up

659
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,514
for those ignorant fools

660
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,148
After that I realized I made more money
by cutting hair than writing articles

661
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:05,199
so I decided to be a barber, understand?.

662
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,311
In the future,
please don't touch random womens' hair

663
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,152
it gives people the wrong impression

664
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,917
Didn't I only cut your hair that day?.

665
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,678
why didn't your dad misunderstand?.

666
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,516
I'm very sorry to leave you alone in the elevator

667
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,749
I should've been with you

668
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,315
it wouldn't be boring if I was with you

669
00:40:49,920 --> 00:41:01,354
Wynners! Wynners! Wynners!

670
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,228
Stop looking at me like that

671
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,119
I don't think of myself as Juliet now

672
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,118
I can live without Romeo

673
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,074
these days you still have to work,

674
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,311
eat and shit even if no man wants you

675
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,592
that's a heroine

676
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,955
come on

677
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,595
are you screwing with me?.

678
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:13,718
I'm not! I just don't want to be screwed with

679
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:18,750
mask off!

680
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,273
ARE YOU READY?.

681
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,669
Today's masquerade

682
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,159
is not just for myself

683
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,355
but also for my dad

684
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,916
5!

685
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,269
- take it
- 4!

686
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,435
- what is it?.
- 3!

687
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,192
- I don't want my dad to be controlled by you
- 2!

688
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,316
1!

689
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:54,675
damn bitch! you are good

690
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,229
I know

691
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:20,514
Ashura! You hate Gandharva so much in this life

692
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:24,593
did you know that you sacrificed yourself
for her in a previous life?.

693
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:29,511
You should cherish your karma this time

694
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,276
I am able to communicate with animals

695
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:49,076
the kid is on the level

696
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,358
"Naga"

697
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:57,629
""Kinnara""

698
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:58,949
Yeah!

699
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,992
""Deva""

700
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,796
"Garuda"

701
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,393
Ah, what's up?.

702
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:14,675
Wow! The Crippled Master?.

703
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,034
I know, last time I lost a hand

704
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,076
this time, grew a leg

705
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:18,275
never once has it been normal

706
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:32,348
Let's see if you're making any progress?.

707
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:49,991
Help them!

708
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:51,550
Ok!

709
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:52,711
Ok!

710
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,511
"Mahiraga""

711
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,633
Huh?. It's soft, didn't hurt at all

712
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,314
it's made of flour

713
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,678
Flour - parachute

714
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:45,069
Bee, I love you!

715
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,435
Grandma, you like Bee so much

716
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,238
you'll live forever

717
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:58,797
I love you! Ultraman!

718
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:15,910
my baby!

719
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:20,869
Huh?. free milk?.

720
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:25,634
This god is so considerate

721
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:44,636
who are you?.

722
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,309
You bitch

723
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:47,231
I'm no bitch

724
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:48,515
I'm Ganharva

725
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:51,672
"Ganharva"

726
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,628
""Ashura""

727
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:11,430
who are you?.

728
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:13,151
Sammi told me

729
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:14,992
you're the type that only thinks of themselves

730
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,436
so I'd be wasting my time explaining it to you

731
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:20,670
Don't leave

732
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:39,796
God! God!

733
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,274
You left so early last night without calling me

734
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:05,000
dad help me!

735
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:05,876
I'm doing a test on him

736
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:07,632
I think your son is Yaksha

737
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:09,394
since we are the Eight Heavenly Dragons

738
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,158
when we aren't busy saving people

739
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:13,709
we can find something else to do as cover,
like having a band, or playing music

740
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:15,757
to carry on the spirit of Woodstock

741
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,273
Iove and peace

742
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,032
wrong! we should be flying around
shopping for smuggled goods

743
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,270
Europe first and then Japan for cosmetics

744
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:21,997
with our power

745
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,798
we could definitely get the limited editions

746
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,353
You dummy, we are gods

747
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:26,635
not gaudy

748
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,392
millions of Hong Kong citizens are watching me

749
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,551
I can't afford any mistakes, right?.

750
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,230
Right! Not only millions, all of China now

751
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:36,839
so I say we make a Chinese Avatar

752
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,718
We'll beat James Cameron! Why?.

753
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,717
we'll do real stuff instead of special effects

754
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:42,638
You guys are not united at all

755
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,153
how can we find the eighth one?.

756
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,073
I have reasons to think the woman
in green is the eighth

757
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:49,038
Why didn't she reunite with us?.

758
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,713
- Why?.
- I know why

759
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,313
- have no idea?.
- Why?. tell me

760
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:54,954
calm down, sis

761

what do you want?.

763
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:09,438
Iast night's concert made headlines today

764
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:10,590
so what do you think?.

765
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,799
Alan Tam and the band have gone already

766
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,110
how can we sing with just a bunch of assistants?.

767
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,751
they are ok

768
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:20,554
But your friend is the important one,
the goddess who saved me

769
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,677
I've never done business with Gods

770
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,438
just ask her to name a price

771
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:39,677
Hmm?. how come your ears are turning red?.

772
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,277
anyway you get these gods for me

stay away!

00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:12,316
freeze!

778
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,033
I've saved you seven times,
so you won't become sashimi

779
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,155
you just keep swimming back

780
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,880
just inform the whales to
stay away from the Sea of Japan

781
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,155
it's radioactive

782
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,349
We're out of money this month,
what can we do, son?.

783
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:25,232
don't worry, I'm here

784
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:28,154
I have lots of gold, here you go

785
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:35,398
I'll change the bars into cash next time, sorry

786
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:43,549
Wow! all four limbs

787
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:45,712
that was a perfect transformation

788
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:46,551
Really?.

789
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:47,556

You thieves

792
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:24,991
I ordered this handbag a long time ago

793
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:27,549
They paid for it! Not thief!

794
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:28,915
Give it back to me!

795
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:31,389
Someone call an ambulance,
we got a brain-damaged god here

796
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,594
What?. You got my signature last time,
and now you want an autographed photo?.

797
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:38,716
why would I carry my picture around with me?.

798
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:41,390
Hey at least I'm a god

799
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:43,830
You think I am your son?. do everything for you

to see through Shall I compare thee
to a summer's day?.

820
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:34,033
Thou art more lovely and more temperate

821
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:38,511
"Good poem! but what's the meaning"

822
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:40,513
Brother, are you Ok?.

823
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:43,399
I'll avenge you! I'll kill all those cops

824
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:44,191
Su Junior

825
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:48,310
Su Junior

826
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:52,990
Who is it?.

827
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:54,191
Doctor

828
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:55,270
Zhivago

829
00:53:58,960 --> 00:53:59,710
What are you doing?.

830
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:04,350
You're losing too much blood,
anybody got type O blood serum?.

831
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,073
Yes! Take it!

832
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,513
What?. what are you doing?.

833
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:11,153
- What are you doing?.
- Giving him a blood transfusion

834
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:13,438
awesome, isn't it?.

835
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:14,675
Ieave Su Junior alone

836
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:15,750
calm him down

837
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:19,750
try to think about something else

838
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,353
just don't about...you know

839
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:22,915
otherwise the blood will spout out

840
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,031
of your thigh

841
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:30,349
Why are you saving me?.

842
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,357
Don't you like being thief?.
I want you to keep having fun

843
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:37,032
Right! Iet's play I'd-rather-die

844
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:42,554
Ah! it hurts

845
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:45,909
Brother

846
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:48,834
Wow, his kidney's like a sieve

847
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:49,910
change it right away!

848
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:50,910
just a minute

849
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:51,996
Yes!

850
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,035
use yours

851
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:55,030
Awesome!

852
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,230
surprised me again

853
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:58,276
calm him down again

854
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:05,274
now you can think about it

855
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:09,435
that way you won't feel any pain

856
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,271
Yes, I just transplanted
one of your kidneys to Su Junior

857
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,237
and removed a kidney stone from the other one

858
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:17,114
Stop saving me

859
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,759
It's alright! Let's play again

860
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:19,915
I'm not going

861
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:20,751
Go

862
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:29,438
Get ready for a face replacement! Got a face?.

863
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,318
Yes, doctors are kind-hearted

864
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:32,316
take mine

865
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:34,590
I don't want his face, mine is fine

866
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:36,753
Maybe he doesn't like this type

867
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:38,069
Iet's help him find his inner beauty

868
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:41,073
Well then, you don't appreciate it

869
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:44,835
No! I won't be a thief ever again, leave me alone

870
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:46,550
Su Junior

871
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:47,709
calm him down

872
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:50,798
Yeah?. You like that?.

873
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:52,235
take your time

874
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,592
pick one out for Su Junior

875
00:55:58,200 --> 00:55:59,758
You're kidding?.

876
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:01,639
you can make him look this good?.

877
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,632
Alright!

878
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,035
Beautiful

879
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:07,036
Brother

880
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:07,916
Who are you?.

881
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:10,116
Bro, I'm your younger bro Su Junior

882
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:11,829
Ah?. what happened to you?.

883
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:19,998
Those seven oriental gods

884
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:21,799
not only stop crimes

885
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:24,156
but also save the environment

886
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:26,197
many young people are copying them

887
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:27,271
suddenly

888
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:30,113
they've become a focus of media attention
all over the world

889
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,672
""HOT GODS"

890
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:42,831
Come down here if you have guts

891
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:46,709
You made so much dirty money, Charles

892
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:50,634
You'll die before you can spend it all.
Come down here if you have guts

893
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:55,271
Always complaining, I'll fire all of you!

894
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:01,833
Boss, actually the spit just now...

895
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:06,631
Boss!

896
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:09,870
Look

897
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:27,276
Have you ever thought what
if you died like that just now

898
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:28,714
everything you have would be meaningless

899
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:34,030
I'm blessed and lucky all the time

900
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:39,992
And I have a friend like you, what am I afraid of?.

901
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,436
To people like you, everyone below you is a slave

902
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:45,709
whoever is against you is an enemy

903
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:47,952
and whoever you can benefit from is your friend

904
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,312
If I'm so terrible why did you save my life?.

905
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:59,073
there is no good, no bad

906
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:00,673
no rich and no poor in god's eyes

907
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:02,919
mercy is our most basic obligation

908
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:06,038
We've saved so many people in the last seven days

909
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:08,108
there are a lot just like you

910
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:11,878
they think because they have support of
the gods they are important

911
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,276
and as a result they become
more selfish, more careless

912
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:19,629
someone said that there was one day
that was the last century's least meaningful

913
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:22,395
because nothing important happened on that day

914
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:35,077
I don't agree, it was a nice day

915
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:38,317
Hey

916
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:46,157
Hey

917
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:55,076
Hey! Don't you leave me! Take me down!

918
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:26,519
38.6 degree

919
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:30,312
Iove at the first sight is real

920
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:37,033
I'd been drinking so much iced water the other
night, trying to reduce my body temperature

921
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,115
but it didn't work

922
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:48,917
I'm still feverish

923
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:18,989
Hey!

924
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:21,390
What are you doing?.

925
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:24,513
I watched The Omen again last night. It's so scary

926
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:27,514
What are you scared of?.
we watched it dozens of times

927
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,558
The lead in the movie

928
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:32,035
Iooks just like the woman in green the other night

929
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:35,719
It's a bit of an Omen

930
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:37,315
What do you see?.

931
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:39,270
Underwear

932
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:42,110
Omen! Nothing

933
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:46,229
Omen! Nothing!

934
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:58,551
Hey,

935
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,069
I just wrote a new song

936
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:01,434
It's pretty good

937
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,911
Give me a break, could you sing for the others?.

938
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:06,275
They all listened, you are the last one

939
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:09,597
Why did you save someone like him?.
just leave him to die

940
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:13,153
Thank you for building a school for our kids

941
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:16,030
No, they thank him

942
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:18,668
The Shengshi protests had been getting worse

943
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:20,796
until last night the Chairman Charles

944
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:24,111
announced a package of amendments to
put down the protest

945
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:25,952
In addition to raising their salaries

946
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:29,396
the company also will also invest 80%% of
their profits every year

947
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:31,079
on employee welfare

948
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:34,428
"Do you think it's a con?. "

949
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:36,439
Could you just find a pen to write it down?.

950
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:37,914
I can't understand you

951
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:42,553
""This is a con""

952
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:43,516
I see

953
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:45,793
""He is much smart than you"

954
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:48,789
Will this decision affect

955
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:50,791
the other companies?.

956
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,793
This is his personal business decision,
I won't do that.

957
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:56,635
I bet the stock of Shengshi will drop

958
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:58,749
profiteer

959
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:00,350
It seems your new decision

960
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:02,676
is not popular with your business associates

961
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:06,874
William Shakespeare said

962
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:08,992
The time of life is short

963
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:12,988
To spend that shortness basely

964
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:15,394
were too long

965
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,194
You wouldn't have said something like this before,

966
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:18,954
what changed?.

967
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:35,912
A friend of mine reminded me

968
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:39,308
Is your friend one of your business partners?.

969
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:44,557
My friend isn't a businessman

970
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:47,869
but I have learned from her values

971
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:51,556
Iike how young people nowadays

972
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:55,350
don't know how to share their success with others

973
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:57,832
As a man I am able to sense

974
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,558
that he is chasing after a pretty young thing

975
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:54,360
Boss, the God Imitation Competition we sponsored

976
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:55,669
has been opposed by the most of our shareholders.

977
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:56,955
Care to give it a second thought?.

978
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:02,113
Whatever! I will not change what has been decided

979
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:05,270
All the girls playing god tonight

980
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:06,993
will receive a 1 00%%% annual salary bonus!

981
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:08,275
Thank you boss

982
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:09,396
Think about it, boss

983
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:10,789
It's late, go home

984
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:15,634
Let's get out

985
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:36,796
Come out

986
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:39,839
Come out

987
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:09,835
Playing with me?. save it

988
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:12,639
the party is not over yet,

989
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:15,676
go ahead

990
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:39,393
"Your decision is helping people""

991
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:41,518
"Don't let this passion down"

992
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:43,717
"Please keep it at 38.6 degrees Centigrade"

993
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:52,508
Say something, Mr. Charles

994
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:54,439
why did you sponsor this competition?.

995
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:56,676
I hoped the young people
could imitate something good

996
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:59,874
the whole city is imitating those gods

997
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:05,311
You call me every five minutes, aren't you tired?.

998
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:06,954
I need sleep even if you don't

999
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:10,795
I know I am annoying,
but I don't know what else I can do

1000
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,234
Could you do me a favor?.

1001
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:14,951
The god came to see me the other night

1002
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:16,593
but I missed her

1003
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:20,993
I wanted to say to her...hello?. hello?.

1004
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:24,110
Mr. Charles

1005
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:33,316
""The God Imitation Competition"

1006
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:36,751
GOD BE WITH YOU God Imitation Competition

1007
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:38,751
I've informed them already, what else?.

1008
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:39,991
Nothing

1009
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:41,833
I just want to see the god

1010
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,752
I've been busy these days

1011
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:46,309
I'll tell her next time when I see her. Wow...

1012
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:47,396
What are you doing?.

1013
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:49,910
Why are you calling me right in front of my home?.

1014
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:53,229
I, I just see that...

1015
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:54,958
You don't see a thing!

1016
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:55,956
Exactly

1017
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:57,719
It's a feather, and it's pink

1018
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:01,631
You got me

1019
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:03,836
I'll tell her to see you tomorrow at sunset

1020
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:05,988
For real?.

1021
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:09,152
Hello!

1022
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:47,872
Sorry, I'm late

1023
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:53,194
It's ok, saving lives is more important

1024
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:07,996
Mortals are different than immortals

1025
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:13,199
we lack confidence most of the time,
that's why we drink alcohol

1026
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:15,912
we can say anything after we're drunk

1027
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:19,876
It seems you have a lot to tell me

1028
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:24,233
Sammi and you are right

1029
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:26,239
I should be straight

1030
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:30,719
I fell in love with someone

1031
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:36,033
at first sight

1032
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:39,797
I have a letter here I've been writing for a week

1033
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:41,269
Iet me read it for you

1034
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:48,839
The first time I saw you,
I remember my temperature

1035
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:51,590
stayed a constant 38.6 degrees Centigrade

1036
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:54,632
but I didn't have much experience

1037
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:56,918
and was too proud

1038
01:09:58,400 --> 01:09:59,435
and afraid of being hurt

1039
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:03,153
To hide my feelings

1040
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:05,039
I cut your hair

1041
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:09,630
Are you alright?.

1042
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:14,149
It's ok, keep going

1043
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:19,594
When my fingers touched your hair

1044
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:21,673
I felt a tingle

1045
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:25,430
so I had to cut your dad's hair

1046
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:28,557
to distract myself

1047
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,353
Shakespeare said

1048
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:38,075
A murderous guilt shows not itself more soon than
love that would seem hid

1049
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:44,750
In the whole time I've known her

1050
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:49,433
I've never found it as easy to speak with her
as I do with you

1051
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:50,716
Why is that?.

1052
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:53,952
I grew up an orphan

1053
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:56,270
you saved me last time

1054
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:58,510
it was like being with my mother,
I felt so safe with you

1055
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:04,071
Mom, how should I tell Sammi my feelings?.

1056
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:08,875
OK, after mom freshens up a little bit

1057
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:18,156
Silly Boy! I'm not your mom

1058
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:22,677
I'm your girl!

1059
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:34,077
Hello?.

1060
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:35,912
This is Jade! something has happened

1061
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:37,871
Da Xiong's Son and my dad have been kidnapped

1062
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:38,916
How did this happen?.

1063
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:39,916
I have no idea

1064
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:43,113
They just left behind a souvenir from the TV tower

1065
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:21,193
I thought I would never
have a chance to tell you...

1066
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:33,032
actually I was the god
in your office the other night

1067
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:38,311
I know, I knew it a long time ago

1068
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,355
It was a setup, otherwise

1069
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:45,994
how could I have trapped all of you idiots here?.

1070
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:56,074
What's on your lips?.

1071
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:58,397
A Love Poison made especially for the gods

1072
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:01,435
you succumbed to me like this in the last life

1073
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:03,509
but you've forgotten

1074
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:08,872
mortals lack self-respect

1075
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:12,877
and an immortal with
a mortal's feeling even more so

1076
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:18,675
I saw every one of you fell for
the ones around you

1077
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:24,514
and I realized that what these mortals called love

1078
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:27,314
could be better used for deception

1079
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:38,078
daughter! Do you hear me?.

1080
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:39,912
How did this happen?.

1081
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:41,633
My shadow caught them all

1082
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:43,114
do you want to meet my shadow?.

1083
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:17,636
Omen! Omen!

1084
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:19,279
Who are they?.

1085
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:24,278
Every single time after we kill them,
they forget what to call us

1086
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:27,433
why don't you help them remember clearly this time

1087
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:32,790
Ha...I am the eighth dragon

1088
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:34,075
you've been looking for this whole time

1089
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:35,635
Yaksha

1090
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:40,112
Huh?. total eight or nine?.

1091
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:44,229
huh?. Yaksha is bisexual?.

1092
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:46,595
So it's like Laurel and Hardy

1093
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:50,550
How about showing some respect to Mr. Laurel?.

1094
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:54,271
you can't just play with Hardy! Yeah!

1095
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:56,236
Scarlet!

1096
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:57,389
What did you do?.

1097
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:01,991
I owed...you in the...past life...

1098
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:05,551
You two fight over everything

1099
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:07,598
even over dying

1100
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:08,989
Every time you guys died and were reincarnated

1101
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:10,718
I sat and waited patiently here for you to show up

1102
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:12,518
figuring out a way to kill you

1103
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:14,271
it was the only thing that gave me pleasure

1104
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:17,671
for last eighty eight thousand
and eight hundred eighty eight lives

1105
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:22,796
What are you laughing at?.

1106
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:24,354
Your life is boring as hell

1107
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:25,834
what are you laughing at?.

1108
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:27,230
What?.

1109
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:28,793
What do you mean what?.

1110
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:31,515
you'll have to wait for decades
before you can kill us again

1111
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:32,835
and during those years

1112
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:35,270
What the hell you going to do, fool?.

1113
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:38,359
He's got company! His shadow

1114
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:42,032
What's the use of talking to a shadow?.

1115
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:44,279
What if it's a cloudy day?.

1116
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,560
Where are you Hardy?. Iike this?.

1117
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:52,152
If we're going to die, let's put up a fight

1118
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:53,031
Ok

1119
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:01,869
You think you can win?.

1120
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:16,231
Please be accurate! Please!

1121
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:22,553
how can you fight with me

1122
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:24,392
if you can't beat my shadow?.

1123
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:46,709
My mom's scarf! Bing!

1124
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:49,390
Got it! Miss

1125
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:04,949
Stop it!

1126
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:07,389
I surrender

1127
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:11,676
Huh?. feel something?. hurt?.

1128
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:21,519
Isn't it all very sad?. Haha!

1129
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:22,556
You've met me in so many past lives

1130
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:24,119
but I didn't know that

1131
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:28,592
it could be so painful to love you

1132
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:51,070
I see

1133
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:52,196
This is not fun at all

1134
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:53,959
I got you guys so easily

1135
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:56,353
each life is less interesting than the last

1136
01:18:58,080 --> 01:18:59,957
Wait! Let me finish my last word

1137
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:04,836
Even though the seven of us couldn't defeat him
in any of our past lives

1138
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:08,239
but we lived and died together

1139
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:10,671
in these eighty eight thousand and
eight hundred and eighty eight lives

1140
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:14,718
wherever in heaven, hell or the mortal world

1141
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,833
We can still play music together ok?.

1142
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:18,512
Ok

1143
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:22,997
"This is true happiness""

1144
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:25,236
Scarlet

1145
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:37,032
""I LOVE YOU"

1146
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:44,111
Huh?. playing the friendship card?.

1147
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:48,552
You've never tried this before! Haha!

1148
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:50,438
This is the first time
in my life giving a hand to others

1149
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:52,758
and it got broken

1150
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:54,393
and it's my right hand

1151
01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:57,391
Thanks

1152
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:01,196
Ah! it's hurt, Miss

1153
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:19,556
daughter

1154
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:38,034
Ya! OK, got it

1155
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:40,158
I knew you've been secretly fond of me

1156
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:42,955
I could be son-in-law if I can't be godson

1157
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:51,914
Hey! I'm Wen from Foshan,
it's very nice to meet you in this life

1158
01:20:58,280 --> 01:20:59,599
See you next life

1159
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,355
""38.6 degrees Centigrade""

1160
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:08,029
Ok! See you next life

1161
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:21,669
It's not over yet

1162
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:22,676
Listen to me

1163
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:25,192
We still have an old man and a boy to play with

1164
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:28,189
Iet us see the boy kill the old man

1165
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:33,190
Where'd they go?.

1166
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:36,874
they can't have gone too far

1167
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:57,271
Let's get down! Come on!

1168
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:04,759
OK! everybody

1169
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:08,909
Group suicide was a great plan, let's not waste it

1170
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:10,593
Ok! Iet's roll

1171
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:11,716
- OK
- Move

1172
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:17,396
It's heavily polluted here

1173
01:23:17,640 --> 01:23:19,198
no wonder he has so much anger

1174
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:26,589
Hey! We're running out of time

1175
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:28,113
We have to get it done before we reincarnate

1176
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:28,996
Oh!

1177
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:35,712
Be quick

1178
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:21,754
Well, I wanted you to kill the boy for me

1179
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:23,556
You disobey me?.

1180
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:31,756
Iet me strangle you to death, you old fool

1181
01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:53,796
Let me help you

1182
01:26:48,280 --> 01:26:49,110
What did you do?.

1183
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,991
Hey?. What did you this time?.

1184
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:09,150
I have no idea

1185
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:11,756
I just feel that it's more comfortable
to kiss him than strangle him

1186
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:13,156
don't you think so?.

1187
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:15,868
Yes...yes...

1188
01:27:16,160 --> 01:27:17,309
Yes my ass

1189
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:21,510
Don't be afraid! Iet me do it

1190
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:26,029
Don't you come over! don't you come over!

1191
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:33,110
What now?.

1192
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:37,430
I don't know! I can't control myself!

1193
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:42,916
When a woman is in love

1194
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:47,230
she cares how much she can give

1195
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:49,792
instead of how much she can get

1196
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:53,072
It's fine that you couldn't do it this time

1197
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:58,557
But next time when you meet a girl you like

1198
01:27:58,720 --> 01:27:59,630
please remember

1199
01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:03,359
that a woman's heart should be cared for

1200
01:28:04,120 --> 01:28:05,348
not deceived

1201
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:35,635
What the hell are you doing?.

1202
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:42,237
It seems she is not dead yet, and she's inside me

1203
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:44,509
What are you talking about?.

1204
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:49,071
I can't control myself

1205
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:51,312
That woman...

1206
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:54,318
Don't you listen to her!
Don't you listen to her! Listen to me!

1207
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:55,949
Why?.

1208
01:28:57,960 --> 01:28:59,188
Why do you care

1209
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:00,230
when you never listened to her in any past life?.

1210
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:01,674
Are you listening to me?.

1211
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:05,990
I'm so confused

1212
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:13,076
Don't panic! Don't panic!

1213
01:29:13,880 --> 01:29:15,108
I'll get in there and kill her

1214
01:29:47,320 --> 01:29:48,753
There was only me in his heart

1215
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:50,553
What are you doing sneaking around

1216
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:51,829
trying to group suicide?.

1217
01:29:53,160 --> 01:29:55,754
Oh, just help him to find his conscience

1218
01:29:56,520 --> 01:29:58,795
His conscience is fine as always

1219
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:02,757
Give me a chance Jade Emperor

1220
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:06,151
They died by my hand in every life

1221
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:08,791
but I never thought they would
still return with kindness

1222
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:12,195
now I understand that

1223
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:17,153
forgiveness is key to releasing hatred

1224
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:21,198
please take my life in exchange for theirs

1225
01:30:23,720 --> 01:30:24,596
What?.

1226
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:27,552
Have you thought it through?.

1227
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:28,716
Yes, I have

1228
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:32,749
coward!

1229
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:34,829
coward!

1230
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:40,558
I've hurt her in every on of the last

1231
01:30:42,680 --> 01:30:44,875
eighty eight thousand and
eight hundred eighty eight lives

1232
01:30:47,080 --> 01:30:48,957
I hope it won't happen again next time around

1233
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:09,995
No...!

1234
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:12,839
I'm not letting you die for her!

1235
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:14,311
Before the concert starts,

1236
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:16,317
you are going to present
with the sponsors on stage

1237
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:18,790
Here's the draft, please take a look to see
if there's any changes?.

1238
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:43,236
Hi

1239
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:44,992
Thank you everyone, thank you Alan

1240
01:32:45,200 --> 01:32:47,839
Don't mention it, it was our pleasure

1241
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,228
It couldn't have been done

1242
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:52,310
if you guys didn't help Bee

1243
01:32:52,680 --> 01:32:54,352
Of course we support Bee

1244
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:56,516
and we also want to help our niece

1245
01:32:58,160 --> 01:33:00,435
Niece?. who?.

1246
01:33:00,640 --> 01:33:03,200
It's Sammi, it was her

1247
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:04,435
who put everything together

1248
01:33:12,920 --> 01:33:13,750
You are Sammi?.

1249
01:33:15,240 --> 01:33:16,229
Bee's daughter?.

1250
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:19,357
Yes!

1251
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:24,359
Why I have never seen you?.

1252
01:33:26,840 --> 01:33:28,592
I was in Hong Kong contacting all the Wynners

1253
01:33:29,160 --> 01:33:30,195
that's why we've never met

1254
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:41,389
I'm Charles

1255
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:44,356
Sammi

1256
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:50,109
The Eight Heavenly Dragons

1257
01:33:50,280 --> 01:33:52,350
are immortals but not gods

1258
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:56,231
your abilities are beyond those of human beings
but beneath those of the gods

1259
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,309
so you can't return to heaven

1260
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:03,195
until you finish your austerity observance

1261
01:34:04,680 --> 01:34:07,114
Yaksha decided to practice from
the beginning this time

1262
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:09,950
it means that the karma between you has run out

1263
01:34:10,640 --> 01:34:14,315
his memories of you will cease to exist

1264
01:34:14,920 --> 01:34:17,957
If you want to help him,
you should keep the secret

1265
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:22,751
and secretly help him to
become a good immortal again

1266
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:33,829
Boss, we're starting

1267
01:36:00,040 --> 01:36:01,029
if I could choose

1268
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:04,960
I'd rather forget a love I shared

1269
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:08,835
than remember one that was forbidden

9999
