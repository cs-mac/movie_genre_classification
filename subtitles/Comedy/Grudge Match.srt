1
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,408
Hello again, everybody, I'm Jim Lampley.

2
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,608
Certain athletes are born enemies:

3
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,047
Bird and Magic. Ali and Frazier.

4
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,929
Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding.

5
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,209
But the fiercest rivalry
was between two fighters from Pittsburgh...

6
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,522
with the names Razor and Kid.

7
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,246
The fight of the year! Both men exhausted.

8
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,129
<i>1982, Pittsburgh.</i>

9
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,489
<i>Razor and Kid,
both undefeated top-ranked contenders...</i>

10
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,881
<i>divide the city in a spectacular war.</i>

11
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,963
Now Kid's smelling
blood, punishing Razor...

12
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,451
with a relentless fury.

13
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,887
And down goes Razor.
Down goes Razor.

14
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,246
Down goes Razor.

15
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,890
<i>"LAMPLEY".
The brutal 15-round bout...</i>

16
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,323
<i>is still considered one of
the greatest fights of the '80s.</i>

17
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,728
<i>Kid and Razor quickly rose
to superstardom.</i>

18
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,642
<i>And the man behind their meteoric ascent
was the late fight impresario, Dante Slate.</i>

19
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,650
My dad was king of the ring
and bringer of the bling.

20
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,481
And that makes me royalty,
blessed with all his powers.

21
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,968
Really good, Dante, but don't
look into the camera. Just look at me.

22
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,805
I don't know. It's better when
I'm connecting with people.

23
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,167
- Yeah, I don't think...
- What's up, people?

24
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,240
<i>"LAMPLEY".
As the world clamored for a rematch...</i>

25
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,767
<i>Slate knew that ratings would turn to
dollar signs for both fighters.</i>

26
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,526
What a turn of events! Unbelievable!

27
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,682
<i>The rematch drew the biggest audience...</i>

28
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,161
<i>since the Thrilla in Manila
nine years earlier.</i>

29
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,921
Kid goes down!

30
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,043
<i>But this time, the story was different.</i>

31
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,330
<i>Razor soundly defeated Kid in a lopsided
victory that was over in four rounds.</i>

32
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,371
<i>What lay ahead was the grudge match that
would've brought each fighter millions.</i>

33
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,047
<i>Then came an announcement
that shocked the world.</i>

34
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,885
Today, I'm announcing my
retirement from professional boxing.

35
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,126
The man's a coward.
I'm gonna get my rematch.

36
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,806
You hear me, Razor?
I'm getting my ****ing rematch!

37
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,521
Sharp has declined to comment further
on his decision to this very day.

38
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,251
And sadly, like many
former professional athletes...

39
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,523
he lost his fortune just years
after his retirement.

40
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,490
<i>Razor went back to Benson
Shipbuilders in 1987...</i>

41
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,642
<i>where he had worked
before he went pro.</i>

42
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:25,409
As the spotlight faded, Kid became a pitchman
for everything from Jockey to jock itch.

43
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,167
<i>Today, he runs a successful car dealership
and a popular restaurant in Pittsburgh.</i>

44
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,367
Hey!

45
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,600
<i>Still, one can
almost imagine him tonight...</i>

46
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,007
<i>on the 30th anniversary
of the fight that never was...</i>

47
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,561
<i>contemplating yet another year
of growing older...</i>

48
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,081
<i>obsessed with a fight
that never happened...</i>

49
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,685
<i>and never will.</i>

50
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,602
- And just for the record, I never
had jock itch. WOMAN: Ha, ha.

51
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,091
I'm just a great actor.

52
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,130
Hey, champ. How's it going?

53
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,760
Don't call me "champ."
Come on. I got your "champ."

54
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,611
Ha-ha-ha!
A little early to start drinking.

55
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,205
You still got it!

56
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,244
I got nothing!

57
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,724
Guys. All right, yeah.

58
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,291
- Walter.
- Hey.

59
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,683
- What the hell is happening?
- You didn't see yourself on TV?

60
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,571
I don't have a TV. Bad for the brain.

61
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,121
There was this thing on
about you and Kid.

62
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,369
Oh, who cares about that?

63
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,885
Man, come on, like...

64
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,042
Why'd you drop out? Seriously.

65
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,571
- You really wanna know?
- Yeah.

66
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,564
Never told anybody this...

67
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,290
but, deep inside...

68
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,970
I wanna dance.

69
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,321
- I wanna dance. The Bristol Stomp.
- Ha-ha-ha.

70
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,171
- The Ching-a-Ling. Pony.
- Stop, you really need to get a TV.

71
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,449
You don't know a good thing
when you see it.

72
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,324
<i>- What's it like?
- It's strong, but it goes down easy.</i>

73
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,163
No, but seriously. Did you know that
Razor Sharp was ambidextrous?

74
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,646
No, I hadn't heard that.

75
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,009
Yeah, you can knock him out
with either hand.

76
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,323
Kind of like how you went down
over and over in that last fight.

77
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,360
- Ooh.
- Got a comedian in the house.

78
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,131
Sir, why do you have to be so rude
to me in my own place?

79
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,282
Easy, Kid, that's a lady you're talking to.

80
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,205
Are you sure, Joey, because this guy's
got a real set of balls on him.

81
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,364
Hey, asshole. It's been 30 years since
those fights. Your shit's getting boring.

82
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,047
Look, I wasn't prepared for that fight.
I was arrogant. I was overconfident.

83
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,565
I just didn't train enough.

84
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,367
Unless you call having sexual intercourse
16 times a week adequate training.

85
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,562
But don't worry, honey,
you would've been safe.

86
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,245
Ooh!

87
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,125
Aha! We got a good audience tonight.

88
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,090
- Mr. Conlon, come on. Let me in, man.
- No, go away!

89
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,642
Hey, what's going on?
What's the problem?

90
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,883
He barricaded himself in with his scooter.
Second time this week.

91
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,247
Second time? Sorry, Nora.

92
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,926
Lightning, it's me. What's the problem?

93
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,010
That degenerate out there!
He replaced my girl, Maria!

94
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,642
Hey, don't say that. You don't even know
the guy. He looks like a nice guy.

95
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,207
No! Maria gives me the sponge bath!

96
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,648
Not this guy.
His hands are like 80 grit sandpaper.

97
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,923
And he's throwing himself into it too much,
if you know what I mean.

98
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,920
Christ, I've never been so clean
in my entire life.

99
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,764
- Hey, I'm just doing my job.
- I know.

100
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,082
Yeah, that's what my scoutmaster said.

101
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,371
Mr. Sharp, we've
had this conversation before.

102
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,081
I appreciate it, but he's just going
through a bad time. He'll get over it.

103
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,442
He's gonna have to start looking
for another facility.

104
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,921
- Okay. No problem.
- Sorry.

105
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,288
Wait, wait, wait. Let me back up. Wait!

106
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:58,964
What kind of man knowingly takes a job
where he's gotta wash another man's balls?

107
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,600
He's a hero as far as I'm
concerned, pal. Heh.

108
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,444
You watch that TV show last night?

109
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,045
Yeah, I heard.

110
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,124
- Listen, uh, your thing. Turn it down.
- What?

111
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:12,330
Oh, the hearing aid.
Goddamn thing drives me crazy.

112
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,689
- Feel like R2-freaking-D2.
- Heh.

113
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,889
Well, I'm still steamed up
over that show last night.

114
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,281
- You could've beaten that punk.
- Save your breath.

115
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,881
That book is closed.
Why does everybody wanna open that book?

116
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,408
Just forget about it. Let it go.
Sleeping dogs and all that.

117
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,562
They told me about the new meds.
You try them?

118
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,964
They say they'll add a couple of years to
your life. Maybe you'll reach, heh, 1000?

119
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,164
What difference does it make?
I can't afford them and you're not paying.

120
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,731
You done enough already.

121
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,009
Hey. No, no. It's all right. I'll
take care of it. Don't worry.

122
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,208
You're the only one
that's never screwed me over.

123
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,328
That's gotta count for something.

124
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,643
Don't change the subject.
I'm still very, very pissed off at you.

125
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,849
Pissed off at me? The fight was
3O years ago. You gotta let it go.

126
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,049
Man, we had so much on the table.
Why did you walk away?

127
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,647
We could be sitting in hot tubs
now with big-ass blonds.

128
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,531
Heh, heh. Yeah. You can't swim.

129
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,810
You would've drowned.

130
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,043
On that note, I'll leave you
with the blonds you'll never have.

131
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,164
Tell Mr. Sandpaper Hands
I want my two sleeping pills.

132
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,322
- It's 10 in the morning.
- Then I want four.

133
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,689
I wanna be dreaming of all them hookers
that you deprived me of.

134
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,206
Hey!

135
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,403
Hey, you can't park here.

136
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,726
Take it easy, man.
I'm the Ghost of Christmas Present.

137
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,927
Really?

138
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,328
Oh, come on, Razor. Razor.

139
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,881
It's Dante Jr. Don't act like
I didn't grow up to be a fine looking man.

140
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,088
Right. Too bad your father
didn't show up...

141
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,403
so I can belt him
for taking what was left of my purses.

142
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,561
Dad passed away last year. - If you
didn't see him dead, I wouldn't trust that.

143
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,960
I did.

144
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,564
Now you make me feel a little bad.

145
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,090
- Wanna come in or something?
- I would love to come in, Razor.

146
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:07,849
You look good. Hey, should I roll my
window up? Is this a good area?

147
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:13,487
Tuna fish, some overripe bananas
that you probably bought on sale.

148
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,801
You shop like my grand mom.

149
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,681
Bananas are a good source of potassium
and I had double coupons for the fish.

150
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,925
That's not fish. Fish is like a sushi.
That's a step above cat food, Razor.

151
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,926
It's dolphin safe and I don't sweat the
extra nickel because it's the right thing.

152
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,209
Not my business. Your house, sorry.

153
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,683
What is this?
It's like a mouse or something?

154
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,961
A dog.

155
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,367
- A dog?
- It's a dog.

156
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,444
- So why you here, Junior?
- Why am I here?

157
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,531
You know what this is, Razor?

158
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,284
A bad movie?

159
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,124
- It's a video game.
- Right.

160
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,362
When did they unfreeze you,
Captain America?

161
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,884
"Captain America"? You know, I'd
like to take you down a peg...

162
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,202
but it looks like
somebody beat me to it.

163
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,406
A height joke.
That was good. That's original.

164
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,369
Height ain't nothing but a number.

165
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,603
See, in Thailand, I'm in the 95th
percentile. I'm okay over there.

166
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,411
So, what you say can't hurt my feelings.
Let's talk turkey.

167
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,887
The guys that made this game
saw your HBO special.

168
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,850
They loved it. I loved it.
Did I tell you? I really did.

169
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,968
Anyway,
they wanna put you and Kid in the game.

170
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,327
Okay?
Before you say anything, hear me out.

171
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,405
All they do is videotape you throwing
a couple punches, record you making noises.

172
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,801
Unh! Unh! Ugh! I'm gonna kill you.

173
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,406
Except in a white guy's voice.
They don't wanna scare anybody.

174
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,600
- That's how simple this is.
- It ain't that simple.

175
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,526
- I can't be in the same room as that guy.
- Okay, okay. Now listen. Slow down.

176
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,967
That's the case,
I'll bring you in on separate days.

177
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,521
You're talking less than
an hour for 10 grand.

178
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,487
Ten grand, man. Easy.

179
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,928
No. Not worth it.

180
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,850
The hell you mean, it ain't worth it?
I'm looking at your house!

181
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,604
No. You're obviously doing well...

182
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,764
with all this F-you mouse sculpture
making money you got.

183
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,161
It's a dog and I don't do it for money.

184
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,647
Tell you what, you wanna play hardball?
Twelve Gs.

185
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,962
Twelve Gs. I pulled it out my ass.
Twelve Gs.

186
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,521
I'll get 12 Gs,
you knickknack-making son of a bitch.

187
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,441
I don't like the way you
looking at me, as if...

188
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,362
Stubborn piece of shit.

189
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,046
You were right to rip him off, Daddy.
You should've.

190
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,400
Come here with a perfectly damn good deal,
you gonna throw it back in my face?

191
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,882
Like I'm crazy? Okay. That's fine.

192
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,805
Piece of shit!

193
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,647
Damn it!

194
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,404
I'll do it for 15.

195
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,241
But I don't wanna see him.

196
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,880
Done and done. That is done.

197
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,491
Ha, ha.

198
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,211
Hey, Raze, real quick.
Do you got any jumper cables?

199
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,564
You think you can give me a jump?

200
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,801
No.

201
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,646
Okay, it's fine.

202
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,966
I'll figure it out.

203
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,169
You've made the right decision.
It's gonna be great.

204
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,290
Thank you, Raze!

205
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,327
He said yes! Whoo!

206
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,285
Excuse me!

207
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:33,050
Come on! It's like ripping off a Band-Aid.
Just come in here and get it over with.

208
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,964
This is stupid. What is this mess?

209
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,122
"This mess" is the future.

210
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,489
Now, come on, Razor. I don't got
time to be playing with you all day.

211
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,122
You got male camel toe.

212
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,285
You look like Buzz Lightyear.

213
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,088
"To infinity and beyond!"
Stop it.

214
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,163
I'm playing. Come on, man.

215
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,883
- I'm not doing this.
- What you talking about? You look great.

216
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,726
- I wish I could put you in a martini glass.
- I've never been this uncomfortable.

217
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,168
Will you relax? It's gonna take you a
few minutes. How bad could it be?

218
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,481
And fix your crotch, man.

219
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,280
- We're ready.
- We're good, Raze. Let's go.

220
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,209
- Looks good, huh?
- Money time, baby.

221
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,648
Looks good. Okay, Razor.
Let's throw some jabs at Wilbur the dummy.

222
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,641
- We're recording your punch form.
- Okay.

223
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,925
One, two. One, two.

224
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,367
Okay. Can you put a little oomph into it?

225
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,921
Heh. This is stupid.

226
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,445
Let's try, okay?

227
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,841
Act like the dummy is real
and the dummy's hitting back.

228
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,087
Imagine that somebody just sold you
a overpriced can of tuna. There you go.

229
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,163
Come on, Razor!
Imagine it's Kid.

230
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,200
- That's good.
- Huh? Damn right, it's good.

231
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,687
Hey, I hope I don't look like that
big of an asshole.

232
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,047
- You set me up?
- Nobody set anybody up, Razor.

233
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,210
What'd I tell you? I told you
to come in 1:00. - I came early.

234
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,569
I wanted to see my old friend. He's
been ducking me 3O years. I missed him.

235
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,530
It don't look like you're missing
any meals. I'm out of here.

236
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:02,685
No, you're not. Not till you admit that
you quit because you were scared of me.

237
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,760
- Why do you talk like that?
- What do you mean?

238
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,008
- Just admit it. It's true.
- You know what?

239
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,128
I'm getting out of here,
and I'm asking nice.

240
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,884
- Or what?
- Just get out of the way.

241
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,364
Listen. Those punches might get these nerds
all hot under the pants, but you know what?

242
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:19,565
They're the same half-assed punches you
threw 30 years ago when you ran from me.

243
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,405
- Move, or I'm moving you.
- Try and move me. Go ahead.

244
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,643
You know, maybe you're right.
I might pop a disc, you're just so fat.

245
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,720
What weight class you fighting at now,
LAP-BAND?

246
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:32,208
- I can still take you.
- Maybe to the prom if you ask nice.

247
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,885
- Pushing your luck now.
- Hey! Hey!

248
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,081
I'm sorry.

249
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,084
- I'm sorry. I did it to you, all right?
- You're just sorry?

250
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,730
You're a lucky guy.

251
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,400
No, no. No! No, man! What are you doing?

252
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,642
- No, no. Razor!
- What you doing with that?

253
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,524
Oh, man.

254
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,243
What are you doing?
Stop it. Don't do that!

255
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,401
I would have beat you!

256
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,400
You done lost your mind?

257
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,886
Come on, come OH, come on.

258
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,610
Come on. Come on.

259
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,886
What are you doing?

260
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,931
Guys, this is...

261
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,764
It's not the behavior of old men!

262
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,086
Yo, guys, you gotta see this. Come here.

263
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,000
Check this out.

264
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,249
And the number one play of the week.

265
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,210
Check out this clip of two former
Light Heavyweight Champs...

266
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,249
that is blowing up online.

267
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:34,962
In fact, Razor Sharp and Kid McDonnen's
brawl has gotten so popular...

268
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,406
it's gone animated.

269
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,681
<i>Come on, come on.</i>

270
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,649
<i>Unh! You're</i> a <i>lucky guy.</i>

271
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,248
You two some kind of superheroes?

272
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,330
Yeah, I'm the Green Champion
and he's the Emerald SuperPussy.

273
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,411
Yeah, must be tough for you, huh?
SuperPussy?

274
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,050
SuperPussy.

275
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:58,167
You can't run or hide anymore, can you?
And you can't ignore me anymore.

276
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,005
Huh? You can't ignore me.
Can't ignore me.

277
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,561
Will one of you hurry up
and rape this guy, already?

278
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,006
Yo, Sharp, McDonnen.
You made bail.

279
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,009
Soon as we get out of these cops' eyelines,
I'm gonna punch you again.

280
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,844
Tell me so I know when to say "Ow."

281
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,163
Ladies! My God, please don't embarrass
yourselves any further out here.

282
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,004
Come look at this. Look at this video.

283
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,889
- What's this?
- It's going viral.

284
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,361
It's got over,
like, a million views right now.

285
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,682
You don't know what I mean
by "going viral."

286
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,524
Razor, you know what YouTube is?

287
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,526
Neither one of you know what "viral" means?
What type of two out-of-touch, old...

288
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,761
- Hey.-
- Hey.-

289
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,729
Sorry. No, no. Uncalled-for. Forget it.

290
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,282
- Look, it's a video of your fight.
- That's me? Hey, that's me.

291
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,887
- They say the camera adds 10 pounds.
- What's your excuse for the other 20?

292
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,805
Do me a favor? Save the verbal jousting
for a more important time.

293
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,644
I'm about to lay something huge on you.

294
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,049
I got a company that wants the rematch.
December 15th, Palace Theatre.

295
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,680
- They want to pay each of us 75 grand.
- Each of us?

296
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,491
I meant each of you.
They're gonna pay you 100 grand.

297
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:03,163
You just said 75. Now you went to 100? - I
was thinking about the thing at the house.

298
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,970
Don't worry, it ain't gonna happen.

299
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,566
Just give me the 15 grand you promised
for the game.

300
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,688
Hey, jagoff, you promised him 15 grand?

301
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,046
He did. Give me the money.

302
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,571
They're not gonna pay you.

303
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,166
Lucky if they don't sue
for breaking the equip...

304
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,085
- I needed that money.
- I should be doing this for the 15.

305
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,686
You should get off me
in front of this police station.

306
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:24,401
I got more money for you. - Nothing
you could offer me. I ain't fighting.

307
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,925
You're still a chickenshit.

308
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,481
- Razor, don't walk away.
- Why don't you wanna do it?

309
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,086
- Please.
- It's a chance of a lifetime, you moron.

310
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,401
Not helping. Razor!

311
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,530
- What are you provoking him for?
- I'm not. I didn't do anything.

312
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:40,009
Well, I did do something,
but that's a long time ago.

313
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,602
And that's probably what it is.

314
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,564
I banged his girlfriend.

315
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,724
- I'm sorry, what?
- I knocked her up. His girlfriend.

316
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,406
Great segue into information
I needed to know earlier.

317
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,722
Probably wasn't a good idea.

318
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,041
A momentary lapse in judgment.

319
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,571
I'll say.

320
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,530
Putting your thing where it doesn't belong.
That's what you...

321
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:06,082
I can't... This is white people shit, man.

322
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,691
Son of a bitch. He ain't
ever gonna fight me.

323
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,962
Can't believe you would. It's insane.

324
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,283
Oh, yeah? What? Give me one reason.

325
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,442
You're old. You're fat.

326
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,120
You got a bad back.
You got weak knees.

327
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,281
You're fat.

328
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,125
Hey, you know, don't sugarcoat it.
Be honest.

329
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,649
Ah...

330
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,922
It ain't gonna happen anyway.

331
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,481
It's never gonna happen.

332
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,642
Thank God for that.

333
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,409
Walter, where you going?

334
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:54,281
More layoffs, man. After 30 years,
they let me go just like that.

335
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,487
You're kidding.

336
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,405
Hey, Razor, boss needs to see you.

337
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,728
Least you don't have a family, man.

338
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,161
Okay, Razor.

339
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,004
No, done and done.

340
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,050
Hey, hey, look, get off my phone
before you change your mind.

341
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,009
Okay, man. Bye.

342
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,844
I am done with you! That's right.
It is over, you piece of shit.

343
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,845
Hell, yeah!

344
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,531
Yo! Get back in your car!

345
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,967
Ain't my car no more, bitch! Okay?
I'm getting a new one!

346
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,363
Sorry! I just won a cracker lottery!

347
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,885
Thank you, Jesus!

348
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:38,570
Thirty years! Thirty goddamn years!

349
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,367
Yes! Yes! Yes!

350
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,521
Yes, yes, yes!

351
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,324
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

352
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,131
Yes! Yes!

353
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,690
Phew.

354
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,810
I gotta get in shape.

355
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,767
All right, Pittsburgh.
Who's ready to make history, huh?

356
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,921
I love it.

357
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:30,050
Okay, without further ado,
I'd like to reintroduce to the world...

358
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,329
Billy "The Kid" McDonnen
and Henry "Razor" Sharp!

359
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,601
Come on, now!

360
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,000
- Thought you said there'd be a crowd.
- Trust me. Sit.

361
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,208
I want you all to forget two things:

362
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,091
The Rumble in the Jungle,
the Thrilla in Manila.

363
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,123
But what you will never forget...

364
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,169
Grudgement Day! Questions.

365
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,244
- Uh, is this fight some kind of joke?
- No, it's not. Next question.

366
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,007
If one of you gets knocked down, is it safe to
say that you've fallen and you can't get up?

367
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,920
Okay. Does anybody have a real question?

368
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,890
Razor, who do you think is in better shape?
You or the Kid?

369
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,963
Depends what kind of shape
you're talking about.

370
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,600
- If it's round, he is.
- Ha, ha.

371
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,128
- So who's gonna train you?
- Who's gonna train me? Frankie Brite.

372
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,327
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

373
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,967
- Isn't he training Geronimo Padilla?
- He is, but he's gonna train me too.

374
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:23,331
What precautions are you taking? At your age,
this really does seem dangerous, even deadly.

375
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:27,451
Understand something. This fight will be
cleared as if it was any other bout, okay?

376
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,764
- Are either of you worried that you won't pass?
- No, I'm not worried. I had all my shots.

377
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,490
Johnny Walker, Jack Daniel's.

378
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,564
- Jose Cuervo.
- Ha-ha-ha.

379
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:40,169
Dante, is there any shot this would be the first
fight that features Life Alert necklaces?

380
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,090
You're being very disrespectful.

381
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,165
A man turns 60, all of a sudden he's washed
up and you kick him out of the workplace.

382
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,006
That may have been fine 100 years ago,
when men were dying at the age of 50.

383
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,289
But in this world, it's different.
The elderly are strong.

384
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,160
Their spirit is strong.
And they have a voice.

385
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,330
And that voice is in these two men
and they will be heard.

386
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,523
Respect, bitches.

387
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,840
Get up, right now.

388
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,363
- That's the way you sell a fight.
- You bet your old grizzly ass it is.

389
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,088
Hey, Razor.

390
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,004
- Whoa, Sally Rose.
- Hey.

391
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,049
I thought I saw you. I wasn't sure.

392
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,806
- Hey.
- You look good. How you been?

393
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,007
So why you here?

394
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,369
- I came to see you.
- You did?

395
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,008
Why would you want
to do something like that?

396
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,561
To talk you out of this crazy fight.

397
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,126
I know what you mean. It's a little crazy.
You think it's kind of a joke, right?

398
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,490
I just don't want you to get hurt.
That's all.

399
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,411
That's good.

400
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,565
Nice seeing you.

401
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,807
How many alcoholic beverages
do you consume?

402
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,923
Normal. Five, maybe six.

403
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,244
- A week?
- Well, maybe a little more than normal.

404
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,768
Ah! Oh, baby Jesus.

405
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,445
It feels normal.

406
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,610
To you, maybe.

407
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,528
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma.

408
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,929
- There they are.
- Hey! Ha, ha.

409
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,242
Just like I said. Paragons of health, huh?

410
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,044
Passed with flying colors.

411
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,445
Clean bill of health.

412
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,080
Not quite "with flying colors."

413
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,607
But it's our paintbrushes
that we painting with.

414
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,923
So look, I'm gonna introduce you
to a guy that's making this happen.

415
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,567
Lou Camare, our promoter. - I would've
met you at the press conference...

416
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,281
but Junior begged me to let him
go in front of the cameras by himself.

417
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,568
This face needs solo exposure.
You know that.

418
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,961
You know, my brother's
the doctor who saw you.

419
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,963
And my other brother,
he's the commissioner.

420
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,283
I can get a dogfight sanctioned if
I needed to. This one was tricky.

421
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,681
Are you saying that I can bring
my dog here too?

422
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,083
That's not what he said. Why do I
feel like there's something coming?

423
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,720
Here's the thing.
The conference didn't go as planned.

424
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,087
We gotta sell 5000 tickets, baby.
Five thousand.

425
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,924
So I'm gonna need help promoting it.

426
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:08,084
Not individuals, both of you.
Together. As a group, okay?

427
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,011
I could never spend
more than three minutes with this bum...

428
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,602
unless I was beating the brains out
He's got it backwards.

429
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,649
He's punch-drunk.
I was smacking him around.

430
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,882
I smacked him from ring post to ring post.

431
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:22,482
A little too much of this in the head.
Little too much.

432
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,642
- When's the fight?
- Boom.

433
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:28,640
If we
don't sell tickets, we don't make money.

434
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,127
- No tickets, no money.
- "No tickets, no money." I'm in.

435
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,490
- That's my guy. No ticket, no money.
- No tickets, no money. No money, no fight.

436
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,330
No ticket, no money.

437
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,848
No fight, no money, no tickets.
Either way you put it, all three ways:

438
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,765
No tickets, no fight, no money.
No money, no fight, no tickets.

439
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,002
No fight, no money, no tickets.
What's the third one?

440
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,880
- All three ways.
- You got it covered.

441
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,047
What's your problem?

442
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,204
You gonna fight, fight.
You're not gonna fight, don't fight.

443
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,169
You fight,
you have to do these things.

444
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,688
The point that I'm making,
in order to do it, we gotta do it together.

445
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,842
Yeah, together. Okay.

446
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,644
<i>It's show time at the Miroquois Casino.</i>

447
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,168
<i>Slots, entertainment and the best buffet
on the Monongahela River!</i>

448
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,481
<i>Just ask these two.</i>

449
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,723
Whoa, will you get a load
of that hunk of meat?

450
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:16,488
Hey, watch your mouth, Billy "The Kid"
McDonnen, onetime Light Heavyweight Champ.

451
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,889
I'm right over here.
Right over by the delicious prime rib.

452
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,886
Sorry, Henry "Razor" Sharp,
onetime Light Heavyweight Champ.

453
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:28,728
I didn't hear you as I am distracted
by this mouth-watering chicken breast.

454
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,565
If you got a gambling problem,
if you're a degenerate...

455
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,405
I wouldn't come down here
because gambling is a cancer.

456
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,404
Cut! Please just follow the script, Razor.

457
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,686
It's not that.

458
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:42,401
The pictures make this look glamorous
but it could be a problem for people...

459
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,369
and I'm saying it should be known.

460
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,364
What is this, improv night at Chuckles?
Come on, say the words.

461
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,046
Well, maybe I just happened
to hit a sore spot, huh?

462
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,044
Didn't you lose 200 grand betting
the Buffalo Bills?

463
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,522
Who loses the Super Bowl four times
in a row? - I don't know. You.

464
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,610
- I thought they'd win once.
- Maybe you got a talent for losing.

465
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,240
- I got a talent for busting your...
- Hey, hey!

466
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,846
- You're getting personal.
- I'm standing here.

467
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,923
<i>I'm gonna put that shit right up your ass!</i>

468
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,367
Heh. No such thing as bad publicity.

469
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,171
<i>Those two ex-fighters
are making news again...</i>

470
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,601
<i>and are trending on Twitter.
We'll have that...</i>

471
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,161
- What a lot of crap.
- What's the matter?

472
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:21,405
You gotta fight in 12 weeks, you're doing
stupid publicity stunts. Who's training you?

473
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,762
Somebody I can trust.

474
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,088
Well, that's easy,
because you don't trust nobody.

475
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,129
- I trust you.
- Ha, ha.

476
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,928
Forget it. I'm a dinosaur.

477
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,006
Come on, we did pretty good
for 13 years together.

478
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,960
In case you haven't noticed, I can hardly
take care of myself. I'm like an infant baby.

479
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,645
Except I got three white pubic hairs.

480
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,122
Heh. You can do this.

481
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,489
I haven't got time.
I gotta find myself a place to stay.

482
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,927
You can stay with me
until I find you a new place.

483
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,890
No. Don't spend any more money on me.
I'm almost done.

484
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,804
It's like polishing a turd.

485
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,326
Do you remember the first time
I came to the gym?

486
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,804
Do you remember what you said to me?
I do.

487
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,644
I said, "it looks like the garbage man
forgot to take out the trash."

488
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,882
Heh. Yeah. Something cheerful like that.

489
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,645
Then you said:

490
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,326
"If I take you on, kid,
you're stuck with me."

491
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,845
You said that.

492
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,446
Don't quit on me, Light.
I won't quit on you.

493
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,850
Oh, here we go.

494
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,525
Call it.

495
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,161
It's a quarter.

496
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,244
Come on. Light, I need your help.

497
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,687
It'd be fun. One last time.

498
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,526
You know why I said what I did
about the garbage?

499
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,681
No.

500
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,205
I didn't want your head to get swelled up.
You were so goddamn good.

501
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,605
Thanks, buddy.

502
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,444
- Raze?
- Hmm?

503
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,364
Give me my quarter back.

504
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,691
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

505
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,530
How can you be so cheap?

506
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,160
I haven't got any money.
Give me my damn quarter.

507
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,526
Okay. Fine.

508
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,725
Nice car.

509
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,203
Oh, wow! This is exciting. Look who's here
to meet me. Kid McDonnen.

510
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,045
You know him from the Internet.
"Two old guys fighting."

511
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,727
He used to be Light Heavyweight Champ.
Wow, you put on a couple pounds?

512
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,684
- You're gonna get me in shape.
- Oh, really?

513
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,961
He's gonna get me in shape.

514
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,048
- Give us a couple minutes.
- They can come.

515
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,884
Watch a real reality show.

516
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,361
- Watch us negotiate.
- Okay. Okay! Ha, ha.

517
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,006
Hey! Ho-ho! All right.

518
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,806
- Let's get real, Kid.
- Okay, let's get real.

519
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,689
Me training you, it ain't happening.

520
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,731
Well, this might be a problem,
because I already made the announcement.

521
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,928
You, my friend, are embarrassing yourself.

522
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,447
A great performer knows
when it's time to get off the stage.

523
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,685
- What? Foreman fought when he was old.
- He was 15 years younger than you.

524
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,285
Listen, you know what I'm gonna do?

525
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,967
I'll go down there and fight
any one of those fighters, the best one.

526
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,569
And then if you see that I don't
have what you want, I'll walk away.

527
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,246
It's over.

528
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,811
Where's your dignity?

529
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,169
You're in my office, begging me
for a comeback you don't deserve?

530
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,800
- Well, take your best shot now.
- Whoa, Kid.

531
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,246
What are you flexing for?

532
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,641
Don't try it. I'm warning you.
I'll lay you out.

533
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,768
- Don't worry, I won't.
- All right.

534
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,490
Oh. Come on, Kid.

535
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,450
- What?
- I saw your fist clench 10 seconds ago.

536
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,251
I saw your eyes dart at my gut
five seconds ago.

537
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,840
You're an old man. You're washed up.

538
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,804
- Ooh!
- Did you see that five seconds ago?

539
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,406
Huh? Huh? What? My eyes darted there first.

540
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,850
I can't believe you. After what I
did for your father, your family...

541
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,122
how you ever could say no to me.

542
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,487
You wouldn't have all
this if it wasn't for me.

543
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,291
You wouldn't have this gym
if it weren't for me.

544
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,444
I don't understand.

545
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:09,080
You mention my father. That's a low blow.
I respect what you did for my family.

546
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,641
- What are you gonna do?
- Okay, I'll let you train here.

547
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:15,009
Good.<i>- I'll</i> even get some
of my guys to help you out.

548
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,606
But you and I both know
I won't be doing jack.

549
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,364
Okay. Thanks.

550
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,648
- Long as we're clear.
- Yeah, all right.

551
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,531
See? You got me moving faster already.

552
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,324
Hey. You again?

553
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,166
- Think I can talk to you for a second?
- Why do you keep following me around?

554
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:38,563
My name's BJ. I'm your son, Kid.

555
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,289
We should get some coffee.

556
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,291
Yeah, I'd like that.

557
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,446
Excuse me, can I just
ask you something real quick?

558
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,887
- You're in training, right?
- Uh-huh.

559
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,407
What are you training for?
A pie-eating contest? Heh.

560
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,403
That's all carbs.

561
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,449
That's good. Maple syrup. It's healthy.

562
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,411
Some Scotch?

563
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:27,247
So when did your mother tell
you about me? - Just last week.

564
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,927
Gotta tell you, if you weren't all over
the news, I don't think she would've.

565
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,085
So how is she?

566
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,928
Well, she's, uh...

567
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,243
She's emotional, you know?

568
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:43,770
My dad. Her husband, the guy who raised me,
he passed away recently so...

569
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,606
- Ah. Sorry to hear that.
- Thank you.

570
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,444
- Was he good to you?
- Oh, yeah.

571
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,090
Yeah, he was the best.

572
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,965
So.

573
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,725
What'd she say about me?

574
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,241
That you were pretty much the worst.

575
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,970
- Really?
- Yeah.

576
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,681
Anything specific?

577
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,326
More specifically. All right. All right.

578
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,290
She, um... She said
you turned into an asshole.

579
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,930
Heh, that's what she said.

580
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:16,246
She said you became a womanizer
and a drunk. Loudmouth, you know?

581
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,811
- Is that all?
- That's it.

582
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,442
- That's bullshit.
- Ha, ha.

583
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,967
Well, I was all those things
way before I met your mother.

584
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:27,284
Yeah, she wasn't too happy
about me coming to see you today so...

585
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,884
Yeah. Well...

586
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,406
Well, why did you?

587
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,684
Guess I was curious.

588
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,290
You were never curious about me?

589
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,440
Your mother asked me to not make any
contact with you so I respected that.

590
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,250
You respected that, but...

591
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,323
You did know you had a son, right?

592
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,927
I wasn't ready to be a dad
and your mother got pregnant accidentally.

593
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,689
You had me and I was a mistake
you didn't want to deal with, right?

594
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,003
- I didn't mean it like that. I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay, I get it.

595
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,845
- Don't take it like that.
- I'm not taking it any way.

596
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,483
You're not a mistake. You're here.
The situation was a mistake. I don't know.

597
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,768
It's okay. You don't owe me nothing.
Take that.

598
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,764
- Put that towards your double bypass.
- What's all this about?

599
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,366
When I came here today,
I was pissed off at my mom...

600
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:22,320
because she kept you a secret from me,
but I think I get why she did it.

601
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,721
Good luck.

602
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,847
Home, sweet home.

603
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,844
It's exactly the
same as it was 2O years ago.

604
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,281
What's that?

605
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,404
It's my hobby. I got a creative side.
Didn't know that, did you?

606
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,607
No.

607
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,569
So where's the TV? You don't got a TV?

608
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,404
I don't do TV.

609
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,688
- You don't do TV.
- Mm-mm.

610
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,330
You got an iPad?

611
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,891
No, I got a regular couch.

612
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,410
It's not a couch, dummy.

613
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,886
I know what an iPad is.
I'm just jerking your chain.

614
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,571
Do you know what an iPad is?

615
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,328
Yeah, I do. It's one of those flat things
you push around with your fingers.

616
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:15,929
It sounds great. Makes me wanna buy one
because you're making it sound so appealing.

617
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,691
Don't use sarcasm on me.
I'm an old man. I confuse easy.

618
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,051
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

619
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,044
<i>please rise for our national anthem
as sung by boxing legends...</i>

620
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,090
<i>Henry "Razor" Sharp

621
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,769
Oh, say can you <i>see.</i>

622
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:39,447
<i>By the dawn's early light.</i>

623
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:46,245
<i>What so proudly we hailed
At the twilight's last gleaming?</i>

624
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,047
Oh, shit.

625
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,164
<i>LeBron burst in your hair.</i>

626
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,367
What?

627
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,808
<i>Gave proof to the night</i>

628
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,325
Unnecessary.

629
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,766
Time to train.

630
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,809
All right. I'm up, I'm up, I'm up.

631
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,686
Just...

632
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:22,971
Unnecessary!

633
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,128
I said it's time to train.

634
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,241
What have I done?

635
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,167
Where's Frankie?

636
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,164
Frankie's not coming till later.
I'm your trainer, Mikey.

637
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,881
You can't be my trainer.
Maybe I'd believe you ate my trainer.

638
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,201
Nice.

639
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,682
<i>Forty-six and chilly downtown.</i>

640
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,729
<i>It's not gonna get much warmer
this afternoon.</i>

641
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,167
<i>Highs today in Pittsburgh
only around the 60s.</i>

642
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,448
<i>Grab a sweater and maybe an extra
cup of Joe.</i>

643
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,841
<i>Right now, here's today's six at 6.</i>

644
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,524
Do fighters still do this?
Seems like a lot of cholesterol.

645
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,841
Quiet.

646
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,120
Drink up.

647
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,970
And don't throw up.

648
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,562
Anything good in the magazine, Mike?

649
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,371
Besides the crumbs
from your breakfast burrito?

650
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,251
Same shit.

651
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,887
Can you believe how bad these Hollywood
stars look without their makeup?

652
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,451
It's horrifying.

653
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,645
What's so funny?

654
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,646
- I was thinking about something.
- Bullshit.

655
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,007
- What are you laughing at?
- Your moobs.

656
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,207
Huh?

657
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,488
- Your moobs.
- My what?

658
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:56,884
Your moobs, they bounce when you jump.
It's like bad Baywatch.

659
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:09,244
Let's go, let's go!
You've only got 50 feet to go.

660
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,844
My ass is numb from
this goddamn scooter.

661
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,851
Hey.

662
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,525
You need a lift?

663
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,282
Why'd you come find me again?

664
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,762
Because I knew you didn't mean it.

665
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,286
How you been?

666
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,291
You mean since the last time I saw you
in 1984? I've been okay, thanks.

667
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,965
Hey! You got 50 more feet!

668
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,408
- Don't quit on me now!
- In a minute, Light.

669
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,610
- Lightning?
- Yeah.

670
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,883
Oh, my God.
I can't believe he's still alive.

671
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,281
I mean, not in a bad way.

672
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,484
So why are you here, Sally?

673
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:04,641
I just think we got off on the wrong
foot at the press thing...

674
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,962
and I just thought we could go and talk.

675
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,484
Well, I'm training right now. Can't do it.

676
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,325
Look, lately,
I've seen a lot of clips of you.

677
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,768
You know, because of the fight and all
and clips of us...

678
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:24,090
and I thought I had filed all of
that away some place really neatly...

679
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,481
Well, that's good.
I mean, you were always neat.

680
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,961
You know, Henry, it's taken me almost
3O years to say this...

681
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,405
but I truly am sorry. I apologize.

682
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,011
It's okay.

683
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,288
You look cold. I'm cold.

684
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,642
It's good seeing you, but I gotta go.

685
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,488
I'm in the phone book under Anderson.

686
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:53,362
My late husband's name,
if you ever wanna talk about this.

687
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:57,364
Why would I ever
wanna talk about this, Sally?

688
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,891
Hey!

689
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,964
Is he a good kid?

690
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,047
The best.

691
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,370
You'd like him.

692
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,885
Well, well.

693
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,605
She's single.

694
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,081
Call her before she remembers
that you're you.

695
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,720
Don't eavesdrop on my
private conversations, okay?

696
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,570
I had my hearing aid turned down.

697
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,041
But you could see she was sending
all the signals.

698
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,966
You could be doing the bone dance with her
instead of welding mice out of crap.

699
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,167
They're dogs.

700
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,930
And I said mind your own business.

701
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,320
Damn it!

702
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:04,404
Why don't you have a goddamn TV?
I could be watching Dancing <i>With</i> the Stars.

703
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:09,088
I'm an old guy. I gotta be watching
Dancing <i>With</i> the Stars. I'm serious.

704
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,082
Come on, baby. Come on, old man.

705
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,285
Your timing's off, Kid.

706
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,123
He's out-hustling you, Kid.

707
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,444
Your timing's way off.

708
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,965
Touch him with the jab.

709
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,565
Move your head.

710
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,487
Tap him with that jab.

711
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,961
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Stop. Shmoo, ease up.
He's like 80 years old.

712
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,645
I am easing up, baby. Come on.

713
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,371
Kid, let's call it a session.
I'm tired just watching.

714
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,291
I can't quit, he's moving too fast.
I can't land anything.

715
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:45,283
Hey, you think I could just make
a suggestion real quick?

716
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,164
- Come again?
- I won't interrupt.

717
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,966
Just a quick suggestion.
He's got a hitch in his jab.

718
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,122
Try timing it with the right.
See what happens.

719
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,970
- Hey, you his trainer?
- No, I'm not.

720
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,286
Then back the hell off!

721
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,680
All right.

722
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,204
Let's go. Ready? Come on.

723
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,640
Oh!

724
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,684
Hey, Kid.

725
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,320
I don't need this shit.
I was doing you a favor.

726
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,801
If you wanna listen to him,
be my guest, all right?

727
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,521
That's my son. He's the first person to talk
to me like a boxer instead of a pair of tits.

728
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,241
Get out of here.

729
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:27,569
You know what? I'm gonna show
you something, you fat piece of shit.

730
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,290
- What the hell?
- Come back here.

731
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,841
Come back, you fat bastard,
I'm gonna kick your ass.

732
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,365
I'll show you a pair of tits!

733
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,010
So Why'd you come back?

734
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,851
I just wanna give you
these back, all right?

735
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,331
I have a dealership. I can't have my son
drive around in that old piece of shit.

736
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,881
I appreciate the gesture,
all right, but just...

737
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,361
You're not buying me into your life.
It's not gonna happen.

738
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:55,524
Just take the keys. Take the keys, please.

739
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,647
- Fine.
- Let it go, Kid.

740
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:02,767
Hey, what's "BJ" stand for?

741
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:06,489
Bradley James.
It stands for Bradley James, but I just...

742
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,721
I like BJ.

743
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,041
We all do, kid.

744
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,010
It's one thing to get one
and it's another to be called one.

745
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,481
Oh, that is clever, I gotta tell you.

746
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,210
Kids in school use to say that...

747
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:19,045
until I smacked the loudest one
and made the rest stop.

748
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,401
I'll bet.

749
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,840
So I spent like a month in the principal's
office because of people saying that.

750
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,963
I guess I actually kind of liked it.

751
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:32,050
- Fighting, you mean?
- No, the principal. She was hot.

752
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,770
Yeah, well, that sounds familiar.

753
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:38,049
So you like boxing too? Noticed this.

754
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,083
I surely got the nose, huh?
Nothing like you.

755
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:47,609
I had some amateur fights,
went to nationals, but Mom made me quit.

756
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,081
My dad, he signed me up for football.

757
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,571
How'd you do?

758
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,688
Played corner in college.

759
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:57,764
But I coach now. I do strength
and conditioning over at Pitt.

760
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,844
- Wow. Panthers. Impressive.
- No.

761
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,129
It's just I got a knack for kicking
fat asses into shape, that's all.

762
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,521
Where'd you get that smart mouth on you?

763
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:09,445
- Did the guy who raised you give you that?
- Definitely not.

764
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:13,730
Ha, ha. No, sir. Funny, nobody could ever
figure it out where I got that from.

765
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,922
Now I'm thinking maybe Mom
had a pretty good idea.

766
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,764
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

767
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,650
Hey, how about you help me?

768
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,847
With What?

769
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,200
Help get me back in shape.

770
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,281
- Like you want me to train you?
- Yeah.

771
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,129
Ha, ha. You're crazy.

772
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,401
- I ain't helping you.
- Huh?

773
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,284
- No, I don't wanna do that.
- Come on.

774
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,489
- I don't think so.
- Come on, just till I find somebody else.

775
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,720
This'll be your salary.

776
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:46,564
It's a Dodge Dart, not a Porsche.
You act like you're giving me something.

777
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,767
That's a piece of shit.

778
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,764
It is a piece of shit, isn't it?

779
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,201
How about I kick a dent in it,
you'll like it better?

780
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:57,091
- There's an idea.
- Want me to scratch it up with a key?

781
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:58,886
Huh?

782
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:03,284
I tell you what. You've got yourself
a deal. You start tomorrow. Six a.m.

783
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,844
- How about 10:30?
- How about 6 a.m.?

784
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,480
- How about 8:30?
- How about 6 a.m.?

785
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:12,929
And do me a favor. Lay off the, uh, flapjacks
and the Scotch, all right, Stay Puft?

786
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,522
Mom is not gonna like this one.

787
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,330
Well, we'll turn her.

788
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,209
"We'll turn her"? Good luck.

789
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:25,203
Oh, by the way, Kid, you, uh...
You got a grandson.

790
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,362
His name's Trey and he's 8.

791
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,042
How do I look in this thing? Pretty good?

792
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,163
Don't get into an accident.

793
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,687
I'm not sure about this place.
Why don't we go outside and do road work?

794
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:48,164
No, your legs are fine. It's just the rest
of your muscles are as rusty as my balls.

795
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,005
Hey, Light. Filter.

796
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,366
Hey.

797
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,530
- Your head's making noise.
- You wanna hear a noise?

798
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,889
It's gonna be the sound of you crying
if you don't get out of here.

799
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,725
That was nice.

800
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:05,248
Like I was saying. We're gonna focus
on your endurance and your speed...

801
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:09,405
so you get so fast, he's gonna crawl
right back up into his mama's vagina.

802
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,245
- Hey, Light.
- What?

803
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,243
"What?" Take a Walk.

804
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:15,881
You sit down right here.

805
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:18,930
Hey, Moses. Looks like Dundee
found your new sparring partner.

806
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,480
Another funny one, Frank.

807
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,689
- He's closer to a pro fighter in
age than you are. KID: Keep it up.

808
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,766
Kid, there's somebody I want you to meet.
My son, Trey.

809
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:29,207
No way.
My family gets bigger and bigger.

810
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:31,408
- Can I call you Grandpa?
- No.

811
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,364
No. Kid. Call me Kid.

812
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:35,244
That seems weird because you're old.

813
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,960
- Just call him Billy.
- Nice to meet you, Billy.

814
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,000
- Nice to meet you.
- I'm gonna go do my homework.

815
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,445
- Okay.
- Go get them.

816
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,921
- Okay, Dad.
- You ready, Grandpa?

817
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,724
- Don't call me Grandpa.
- Don't like that?

818
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:49,202
Last night I decided we're going to
train in a very particular way.

819
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:51,283
We're going to train old school.

820
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,603
None of this... None of this Pilates crap.

821
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:58,924
I'm talking real old school. I'm talking
Johnson, I'm talking Dempsey, I'm talking Louis.

822
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:02,004
And today, we're gonna start
with pool punching.

823
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,730
What's pool punching?

824
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:10,724
Let's go! Joe Frazier did this three hours
a day! You're not even going five minutes.

825
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,530
Joe Frazier didn't do this.

826
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:13,966
So what?

827
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,930
Let's go. Let's go. Give me 10. What
do you say? Attaboy. Let's go, there's one.

828
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,925
And...

829
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,491
a...

830
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:25,641
half.

831
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,165
Are you kidding me?

832
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,482
Really? That's it?

833
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:30,880
One and a half?

834
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,681
Ali-Frazier.

835
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:00,686
What did Frazier do? He drove him nuts by
rolling under that right hand and, barn...

836
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:03,002
he threw the left hook.
Roll and throw, Kid.

837
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:06,448
So you work on that,
I'm gonna surprise you with balls.

838
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,046
It reminds me of a woman
I met in Bangkok...

839
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,611
Surprise!

840
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:18,165
What do you think he's got here?
Hundred? Two hundred acres?

841
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,881
All this stuff here just rusting.

842
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:25,166
He's sitting on a gold mine.
He's got endless piles of crap.

843
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,891
- Light, you're killing me.
- Put up 100, 150...

844
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,802
500 condominiums here.

845
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,008
You gotta be quiet. Unh.

846
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:37,370
Five, six hundred. I bet you $10,000,
he'd sell the whole goddamn thing.

847
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:40,564
- Unh.
- Don't stop. Don't stop!

848
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,004
Ha, ha!

849
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:45,367
- Didn't I tell you not to stop?
- Aah!

850
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,000
Ha!

851
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:04,561
Attaboy.

852
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,001
Let's go, get your elbows up.
Find a rhythm.

853
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,488
Attaboy. Attaboy.

854
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,722
Through the bell, through the bell,
through the bell!

855
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:28,411
Time! Attaboy. Attaboy.

856
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:30,810
Sorry you had to see that, Trey.

857
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:37,247
Hey, Kid.

858
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:40,364
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm sore.

859
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:58,123
- Hey! What are you doing?
- I thought you wanted me to hit this.

860
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:01,284
What are you gonna do?
Beat up the meat? That's not sanitary.

861
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,289
No, we're just here to buy dinner.

862
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,926
- You don't have to punch everything.
- Right.

863
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:14,601
Let's go, up! Pop. Pop.
Attaboy. Come on! Up! Up!

864
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,608
What is it exactly
that you're doing right now?

865
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:20,125
- What are you doing?
- Resting.

866
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:22,681
Taking a rest, huh?
That's gonna get the job done.

867
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:25,002
Jesus Christ, did you just fart on me?

868
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:29,290
Did you just fart on me? Are you
kidding me? You gotta be kidding me.

869
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,330
Good God, come on.
You're better than that.

870
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:36,007
You kidding me?
You know, my head's right there.

871
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,329
Hey. This is insane.

872
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:47,171
What? You paratrooped in 'Nam.
What's the problem?

873
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:49,681
Hey, that was 40 years ago,
for crying out loud.

874
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:52,446
Shut up! Get out of the plane!
This is great promotion!

875
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:55,206
Guys, go get ready.
Because the target is right there.

876
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,361
All right, let's go!

877
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:03,009
- Go now?
- You're good!

878
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:06,441
Oh, Shit!

879
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:12,041
Ha-ha-ha!
- God, that felt good.

880
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,363
You jagoff!

881
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,362
- You threw his old ass out the plane!
- Why are you laughing?

882
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:21,330
I forgot to tell you,
first one down gets an extra five grand.

883
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,488
- Shit!
- Don't forget to pull the string!

884
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:31,251
Oh.

885
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:42,090
That's just beautiful! Precious!

886
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:44,891
Magic!

887
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:48,563
<i>Sharp and McDonnen made quite
the splash when the two 60-plus fighters...</i>

888
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,564
- Oh, my <i>God. They're nuts!
- ...parachuted into</i> a <i>parking lot.</i>

889
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,240
- Nuts!
- Although <i>their</i> landing...

890
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:59,771
<i>didn't go exactly as planned...</i>

891
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,840
- Thank you.
- Both men <i>walked</i> away...

892
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,769
<i>with only a few bruises.</i>

893
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:05,841
Wow.

894
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,929
Okay, new regimen.

895
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:13,210
Starting today, you're gonna be soaking your
hands in this stuff. Make them leathery.

896
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,767
- What is it?
- It's horse urine.

897
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,282
I'm not sticking my hand in horse urine.

898
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,920
Oh, you're telling me
you're better than Jack Dempsey?

899
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:26,762
Because every day Jack Dempsey
would soak his hands in horse urine.

900
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,770
And nobody had a tougher punch
than Jack Dempsey.

901
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,287
Did you heat it up or is it fresh?

902
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:45,250
- Ha!
- What?

903
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,606
It's vinegar.

904
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,487
- I knew that.
- I'm kidding.

905
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,565
<i>It's horse piss.</i>

906
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:52,960
It's vinegar.

907
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:54,646
I'm kidding.

908
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:55,961
Vinegar.

909
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:59,767
- I am kidding, actually.
- Come on!

910
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,810
Take a shower.
Wash your hands very, very thoroughly.

911
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,400
- You can still smell the horse piss.
- Wait, don't put it...!

912
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,481
Don't put it in there.
Just throw it in my room.

913
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,927
- Why? What's wrong with...?
- Just get it off the box.

914
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:13,801
What do you got in there, the Hope
Diamond? - Don't worry about it.

915
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:15,848
- Your porn stash?
- It's not funny.

916
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,081
Letters from Sally.

917
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:22,482
Aw, for God's sakes, call her up!

918
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:24,125
What are you talking about?

919
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:30,281
Deal with Sally, or your head won't be clear
and she's gonna screw up your fight again.

920
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:33,800
- What do you mean, "again"?
- Oh, for God's sakes.

921
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,645
A guy has sex with my girl,
I want to knock his teeth out.

922
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,167
- Why didn't you?
- Because Kid loved boxing.

923
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:42,011
I wanted to take from him
the one thing he cared about most...

924
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:46,285
because that's what he took from me. - Well,
you sure have a funny way of showing it.

925
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:49,840
You're my buddy.
But be careful where you're going...

926
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,804
because you don't
know anything about it.

927
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:55,762
Forgive me, but you keep talking
about how much she meant to you.

928
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:59,362
All I remember is you would show up
at the gym first thing in the morning.

929
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:04,048
You would be the last person to leave at night.
You didn't have time for anybody or anything.

930
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,328
You blamed her for ruining
the relationship.

931
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:10,050
Well, maybe the real problem was you.

932
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,645
- Trey, you have a good time?
- Yeah, I did.

933
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:27,361
- I know you're kidding.
- Hey, Sally. Long time.

934
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,280
- Ma, look...
- You're not training this guy.

935
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:31,527
- It was my idea. Don't get mad at him.
- I'm serious.

936
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,045
- I understand.
- BJ, I'm serious.

937
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:36,090
What's the point of telling me
if you don't want me interacting with him?

938
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,561
Interacting's one thing.
Working with is another.

939
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,324
- Why?
- You can't be trusted.

940
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:41,925
He's training me. That's all.

941
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,641
- I don't care!
- Stop yelling!

942
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:47,088
I think everyone's a little cranky
because they haven't eaten.

943
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:48,401
I say we do this.

944
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,728
- Burger, burger...
- Salad.

945
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:53,325
And a glass of white wine.

946
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:56,081
Works, right?

947
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:57,765
- That sounds good.
- Sound good?

948
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:07,286
You know, it might be helpful if you told
us what you hated about the guy so much.

949
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,124
Yeah. He doesn't seem that bad.

950
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,248
- You know I offered to marry her?
- You did?

951
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:14,404
- He didn't want to marry me.
- No, I offered to marry you.

952
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:17,771
You also offered to sleep with my sister
the same night.

953
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:19,405
I can still hear you!

954
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:23,804
- You did sleep with Carol, my friend.
- That's what she said.

955
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:27,646
You must be really tired if you fall asleep
with all these people.

956
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:31,285
- Sometimes people make you tired.
- You know what?

957
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,808
I've got some quarters. Why don't
you go play a game? That'd be fun.

958
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:38,442
Come on! This is the best dinner
conversation we ever had.

959
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:40,409
Trey. Why don't you go ahead, okay?

960
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:44,971
So, what happened?

961
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:47,646
- I was an idiot.
- No, you weren't an idiot.

962
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:51,327
- You were young and confused.
- "Confused"? Oh, man.

963
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:54,006
You thought you liked him.
You realized you loved me.

964
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:58,529
One thing led to another
and I couldn't handle settling down.

965
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:01,160
So I was gonna do the right thing.
I was gonna marry you.

966
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:02,651
I didn't want to marry you.

967
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,649
I didn't love you. I loved him.

968
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:06,171
Why did you sleep with me?

969
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:07,481
I was stupid.

970
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,842
Well, girls have slept with me for less.

971
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,163
There was this one girl, slept with me.
She thought I was Marv Albert.

972
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:16,403
- Because my haircut was different.
- You are unbelievable.

973
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:19,763
Why couldn't you pick George Foreman?
We would've been rolling in grill money.

974
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:24,363
I've been with three people.
Three men in 30 years.

975
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:25,646
- Mom...
- Two, I loved.

976
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:28,087
Your father, not him. And Razor.

977
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:29,964
Ma, don't go.

978
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,441
What a bunch of nonsense. What is this?

979
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:44,126
What are you talking about?
It's called promotion, Kid.

980
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:45,486
- Hey.
- Yes, Razor.

981
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:48,883
I know we've got a contract,
but I can't stand being around that clown.

982
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:53,125
What is up with you? Huh? Did you wake up
on the wrong side of the tenement?

983
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,442
Hey, Webster. Show a little respect.

984
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:59,326
And I choose to believe that you called me
Webster because of my vocabulary...

985
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:02,761
- ...not because of my height and race.
- No, it's because you're short and black.

986
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,609
That's funny. That's real funny.

987
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:06,728
What was Jesus like?
I'm curious. Was he cool?

988
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,245
They're ready for you.

989
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,971
They call your names,
head right up to the octagon.

990
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:12,491
The octagon?

991
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,324
Well, what kind of stupid sport is this?

992
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:17,404
Boxing's better? They fight in a
square and they call it a ring.

993
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:18,891
What is the problem, guys?

994
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:20,809
- Good point.
- Thank you.

995
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:24,360
Walk up on me and I promise
I'm gonna bust your ass.

996
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:27,410
Please welcome boxing legends,
Billy "The Kid" McDonnen...

997
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:29,244
and Henry "Razor" Sharp.

998
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,365
Pleasure to see you.

999
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:33,851
Thank you for your time.

1000
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:37,411
Guys, thank you very much. Welcome.
Thanks for joining us.

1001
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:38,647
Thanks for having us.

1002
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,609
So, what do you guys
think of the event?

1003
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:45,004
I mean, no offense, but to me,
next level beyond boxing, huh?

1004
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:47,208
I don't... I don't get it.

1005
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,084
- Yeah, me either.
- What are you doing?

1006
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,608
If I wanted to see two guys grab
each other's balls...

1007
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:56,765
- ...I'd try the men's room at Kid's restaurant.
- That's why we throw him out all the time.

1008
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:59,605
Called Knocked Out, by the way.
337 Charles Street.

1009
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,603
- Everybody's invited.
- Come on, Kid!

1010
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,730
Listen. You gotta hold it down
because you're driving me crazy.

1011
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:07,207
I'm sorry. Do I give a shit? No!

1012
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:10,284
Man, are you gonna be feisty
when you hit puberty.

1013
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:15,202
What is it that you do not like
about mixed martial arts?

1014
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:17,840
It's okay. We had a name for guys
that kicked when they fought:

1015
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,047
Girls.

1016
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:24,563
You know what? I think our audience
is taking offense to the fact...

1017
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:27,041
that you don't believe
this is a skilled art form.

1018
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,487
Look at this! Look at this!

1019
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:31,051
They booing us!

1020
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:33,967
- What did...?
- Say whatever you want.

1021
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:35,730
That's great. That's great.

1022
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:38,326
You can kiss my black ass
if this shit don't happen.

1023
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:40,446
That's fine.

1024
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:43,649
Kid, compare MMA to boxing.

1025
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,962
Well, to me, it's more like pro wrestling.

1026
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:47,849
Really? Interesting.

1027
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:50,847
- Chael Sonnen!
- Hey, Grandpa!

1028
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:53,844
Is this what they call manners?

1029
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,241
You come here to our venue
in front of our fans.

1030
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,448
You're gonna compare us to rassling?

1031
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:01,211
Ha. Did he say "rassling"?

1032
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:04,284
Why don't you stand there
in your sweatshirt and look stupid...

1033
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:07,370
- while I speak to your fellow geriatric?
- Hey.

1034
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:10,524
Look at this guy. Who are you?
I don't even know what your name is.

1035
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:14,526
I'm the guy asking you to pick up one of
your arms and throw it in my direction...

1036
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:18,685
so I can put you on your ass and you
can tell these fans if it felt scripted.

1037
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:19,841
Go.

1038
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,286
- Hey.
- Go ahead.

1039
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:25,047
You know what? Yeah, be my guest.
You take your first shot. I challenge you.

1040
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,009
Hit him! What are you wasting your time?

1041
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:30,607
Why are you interrupting? You got
some courage? You want to take a shot?

1042
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:33,371
I don't want to take a shot.
I want you to smash him.

1043
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:36,524
Go ahead. Hit him. Hit him. He
wants to be hit. - Shut up, old man.

1044
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:41,565
Oh, shit!

1045
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:44,563
Guess that's that.

1046
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:47,645
That was a lucky shot.

1047
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:01,881
<i>Hello?</i>

1048
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:05,083
Why didn't you say anything?

1049
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,680
It was busy.

1050
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:09,127
No one's phone is busy
anymore with call waiting.

1051
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:12,730
It's probably her.

1052
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:14,331
What? How'd she know?

1053
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,244
Caller ID.

1054
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:20,288
Would it be easier if I said
she had magic powers?

1055
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:23,011
- Don't.
- Hold on, Sally.

1056
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:30,081
Sally. How you doing?

1057
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,083
<i>- Hello.
- Hi. Hey.</i>

1058
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:33,401
Well, hey.

1059
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:37,201
Uh, call and hang up,
just like the good old days.

1060
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:41,684
<i>Heh. You know, I just saw you on TV
punch some guy out.</i>

1061
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:42,887
<i>I mean, wow.</i>

1062
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:45,686
I mean, your punch is really great.

1063
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:47,080
<i>Yeah, I was lucky.</i>

1064
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:49,083
<i>- No, really.
- I appreciate it. Thanks.</i>

1065
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:52,449
Listen, I was thinking about
what you were saying about meeting.

1066
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:55,410
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you know, just to catch up.

1067
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:57,449
<i>Sure. I'd love to.</i>

1068
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,090
<i>When?</i>

1069
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:00,969
Whoa. Wow.

1070
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,043
<i>- Wow,</i> what?
<i>- No, I was just...</i>

1071
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:05,851
I don't know, maybe tomorrow?
Tomorrow would be good.

1072
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,047
<i>Okay-</i>

1073
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:09,171
<i>So I'll see you then, okay?</i>

1074
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:57,081
Whenever you're ready, come see us.
Thank you.

1075
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:59,485
Judd, what's with the crowd?

1076
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:02,405
Well, apparently,
everybody wants to buy a car from you.

1077
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:03,925
Well, that's a good change.

1078
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:08,764
Hey, what's going on, Lou?

1079
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:11,003
Nothing. I'm in my office right now.

1080
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:12,810
Hey, hey, how we selling?

1081
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:14,281
Oh, that's good.

1082
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:16,283
No, that's real good, Lou.

1083
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,041
What?

1084
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:19,611
Are you kidding me right now?

1085
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:21,643
- Hey, shut up!
- Hold on.

1086
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:24,969
Don't tell me to shut up! You shut up!
I found out I'm about to be rich.

1087
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:26,884
You know what?
I'm gonna buy this place...

1088
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:30,089
and turn it into a gentlemen's club
and I'm not gonna hire you.

1089
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:33,005
I'm gonna hire everybody else,
except you two.

1090
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:35,529
Uh! Uh!

1091
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,564
Hey, way to do it, Kid!

1092
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:44,323
Look who's here. Look who's here. Wow.

1093
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:46,244
Did you see this guy on TV last night?

1094
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:49,244
Was that amazing or what?
I mean, you really kicked ass.

1095
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:51,368
You made us old-timers
look real good last night.

1096
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:55,200
Kid, you know what I was thinking?
Thought I'd train you today.

1097
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,488
- Yeah? Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

1098
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:58,926
Follow me.

1099
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:01,408
Johnny, get up in the ring. Spar with Kid.

1100
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:05,087
Looking good. Good job, Kid.
It was great last night. All right.

1101
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,090
- Thanks, Frankie.
- Stay loose.

1102
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:09,811
I like it. You're looking like
new money in there. Ha, ha.

1103
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:11,166
All right.

1104
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:14,043
I thought you were his trainer, Dad.

1105
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:15,531
Yeah, buddy, so did I.

1106
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:18,001
Yeah, Frank.

1107
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,243
You know, this is great, Frankie.

1108
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:25,926
Being in the main ring with you and the crew
and all that, but I already have a trainer.

1109
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,889
- Can you stop filming?
- No, don't stop.

1110
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:31,525
Stop filming.

1111
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:33,964
What's your problem, Kid?

1112
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:36,480
I thought you'd be thankful
I was offering to work with you.

1113
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:37,761
I'm trying to do you a favor.

1114
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:41,567
I'm grateful. Nice of you to come down
from your mountain to do me this favor...

1115
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:43,563
but I don't need a favor.
I need a trainer.

1116
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:45,800
You stuck me with that guy,
who's such a dumbshit...

1117
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:48,207
he doesn't even know
I'm talking about him right now.

1118
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:49,805
- See?
- It's what it is.

1119
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:52,281
The only reason you give a shit
is I finally got some heat.

1120
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:54,647
- Let's be honest, Frank.
- Oh.

1121
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:55,926
- Really?
- Yeah.

1122
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:57,445
- Really?
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

1123
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:00,410
Oh, okay. You're the original media whore.

1124
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:01,800
- Your mother's a whore.
- What?

1125
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:05,965
Your mother's a whore. And I named my
son after her best trick. Right, BJ?

1126
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:07,407
Trey, you stay here.

1127
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:09,847
You call my mother a whore?
You call my mother a whore?

1128
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,764
You call my... Unh!

1129
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:15,811
Well, that's that.

1130
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:17,486
Start the car.

1131
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:20,130
Come on, buddy. Let's go.

1132
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:21,770
Let's go, yeah. Let's go, Dad.

1133
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:29,007
Dad? What do the letters in your name mean?
The B and the J?

1134
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:31,845
You gotta be kidding me.
You see what you started?

1135
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,002
You started this.

1136
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:36,401
Well, you know, Trey? I'll answer that.

1137
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:39,080
B and J stands for...

1138
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:42,365
"butterscotch jellybeans."
Really?

1139
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:44,488
A lot of guys
like butterscotch jellybeans.

1140
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:46,051
But you know the problem?

1141
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:49,005
Sometimes, women don't like
to give guys butterscotch jellybeans.

1142
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:52,647
- Ha-ha-ha.
- I love butterscotch jellybeans a lot.

1143
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:56,009
I like to have, like, 100 a day.

1144
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:59,130
Well, what an appetite you have.
Boy, oh, boy.

1145
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:03,164
Hey, you know, uh,
what you did back there...

1146
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:05,370
you stepping up like that.

1147
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:08,205
I appreciate it. I just
want to let you know.

1148
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,048
I don't have any use for that jagoff.

1149
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:14,646
Crap, I'm gonna be late
for football practice.

1150
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:17,087
'Hey', Trey-Trey, you got
your stuff, right? - Yep.

1151
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:19,971
I'm gonna drop you off at grandma's
on the way to Kid's.

1152
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:21,406
I wanna stay with Kid.

1153
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:23,688
Oh, you wanna stay with Kid?
Well, you can't.

1154
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:26,411
No, you know what?
Maybe he could stay over tonight.

1155
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:29,006
We can have like a sleepover.
What do you think? Huh?

1156
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:30,481
You like that?

1157
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,405
Your grandmother will have my hide.
It ain't happening.

1158
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:35,085
- Come on!
- Look what you started.

1159
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:37,368
- Come on! Please!
- You gotta jump in there too?

1160
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:39,204
Yeah, you're the dad. Come on.

1161
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:41,567
- Please.
- All right, all right. I tell you what.

1162
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:46,089
You can stay, as long as we make it
a dudes-only secret.

1163
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:50,211
Works for me. You know dude secrets
are very important in life, Trey.

1164
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:52,328
Your buddies, they gotta look out for you.

1165
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:56,166
Like, if you're in a movie and you start
crying, you don't want people to know.

1166
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:58,561
They won't tell anybody
because they're your buddies.

1167
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:00,848
They cover for you when
you get in trouble...

1168
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,800
like when you have a gambling problem
or an unexpected visit in the drunk tank.

1169
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:08,851
- I think he probably he gets the point.
- No, he's a very smart, intelligent kid.

1170
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,490
It's amazing you're 8 years old.

1171
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:13,405
I thought you'd be maybe like 9 or 10,
or even 11.

1172
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:15,403
- I'm almost 9.
- Almost 9.

1173
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:18,928
Dad, for my birthday
can I have butterscotch jellybeans?

1174
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:21,361
Ha-ha-ha. I don't know, bud.

1175
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:24,444
- You got a few years to wait on that one.
- Please?

1176
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:29,005
So...

1177
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:32,244
anyone in your life these days?

1178
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:35,087
There's been a few over the years.

1179
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:38,691
They stick around for a while,
and then they see these kind of, uh...

1180
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:41,047
Oprah shows about relationships.

1181
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:43,965
They tell me, "How come
you don't talk about your feelings more?"

1182
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:46,964
And I say,
"Well, women are more verbal than men."

1183
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:50,283
And they go, "Huh?" And "What?" Heh.

1184
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:51,805
Then they leave.

1185
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:54,201
Wow, listen to you.

1186
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:56,203
"Women are more verbal than men."

1187
01:04:56,360 --> 01:05:00,445
Yeah, I read an article in Time magazine that's
"Women are More Verbal than Men."

1188
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:03,651
It's true.

1189
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:07,371
You know, I know it was a long time ago,
but...

1190
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:10,283
what happened? Really.

1191
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:13,644
You were everything in my life.

1192
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:15,890
Then Kid beat you.

1193
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:18,841
And you were different.

1194
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,126
And I was lost.

1195
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:22,248
And everything started to fall apart.

1196
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:26,126
Listen. This is ancient history.

1197
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:30,162
I put it behind me.
And I don't wanna get emotional about it.

1198
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:33,330
I hope you've put it behind you.
I just want to keep it calm.

1199
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:34,527
But why him?

1200
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:37,331
I mean, seriously,
of all the people in the world?

1201
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:39,968
I can't get it through my head.

1202
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:41,525
I lay in bed at night.

1203
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:44,490
I want to pound my head against...
I dream about killing this guy.

1204
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:47,644
Why him? He's the worst guy in the world.

1205
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:50,371
- Why?
- Okay. Okay.

1206
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:53,884
Remember when you went to the Catskills
to train?

1207
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:57,328
You wanted to be alone.
You wouldn't return my calls.

1208
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:58,891
Six months turned into a year.

1209
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:02,169
I know that now,
but I was focused on winning the title.

1210
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:06,120
I know that. I know that.
But I was so in love with you.

1211
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:09,727
And I even flew up to surprise you.

1212
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:11,530
And then I saw you with that woman.

1213
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:15,526
I didn't know her. Nothing happened. I had
no idea who she was. She just showed up.

1214
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:16,727
What did I know?

1215
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:20,043
I just wanted to hurt you
as much as I thought you had hurt me.

1216
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:24,201
And so...

1217
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:27,567
Kid.

1218
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:30,727
Kid.

1219
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:37,404
Kid. All right.

1220
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:39,050
I understand.

1221
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:42,364
Wow.

1222
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:45,251
I think we've depressed the shit
out of these pigeons.

1223
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:47,368
- No, don't say that. Right?
- Ha, ha.

1224
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:00,601
It's the first time taking you alone.
You nervous?

1225
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:05,448
For you, maybe. If I told my dad you used
a 12 pack of beer for a car seat...

1226
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:06,806
he will not be happy-

1227
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:10,288
He should've given us one,
but you know what? It'll be our secret.

1228
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:13,967
- And I'll drive slow. All right?
- Mm-hm.

1229
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:18,603
So, what do you wanna do tonight, huh?
Go to the movies?

1230
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:20,802
If it's PG-13 or R. I don't do G.

1231
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:25,603
- Oh, wow. You're old for your years.
- You too.

1232
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:29,046
Yeah. Dante.

1233
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:30,770
We bigger than Pittsburgh, Kid!

1234
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:32,968
<i>- Well, what do you mean?
- What's it</i> mean?

1235
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:36,963
It means we sold too many seats.
It means we need a bigger venue.

1236
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:39,043
<i>Dude, the UFC thing put us over the top.</i>

1237
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:42,001
- How we gonna get a new venue?
<i>- What</i> do you mean? <i>It's</i> already done!

1238
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:44,811
<i>The Consol Energy Center wants us!
Eighteen thousand seats.</i>

1239
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:47,884
- You messing with me?
- No, I ain't messing, you geriatric prick.

1240
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:50,003
<i>Pay-per-view and HBO too.
I forgot that.</i>

1241
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:54,404
<i>Let me tell you, if people buy this thing,
do you understand this will set us straight?</i>

1242
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:55,971
<i>A different type of money.</i>

1243
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:59,283
I'm talking about
that Kardashian sex tape type money.

1244
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:01,681
- Don't mess with me, man.
- This is real, man.

1245
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:03,001
<i>This is money, baby!</i>

1246
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:05,003
Yeah, good. All good. Good.

1247
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:06,721
- I just wanted to let you know.
- Good.

1248
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:08,649
- Bye, man.
- Thanks.

1249
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:10,526
Yeah.

1250
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:12,763
I'm making it, baby!

1251
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:15,841
I left my keys in the house. Goddamn it.

1252
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,924
So since we established
that I've never been that verbal...

1253
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:23,369
and even you told me I had a hard time
communicating. Remember that?

1254
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:26,922
- Uh, yeah.
- You didn't have to say it like that. Heh.

1255
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:28,610
Well, you were right.

1256
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:30,524
And I worked at it.

1257
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:35,481
I started making things
from junk or objects...

1258
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:39,204
that I found at the yard.
And I made this for you.

1259
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:42,283
Oh, it's darling.

1260
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:45,327
- It's...
- A mouse, I guess.

1261
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:49,201
No, it looks more like a dog.
Yeah, it's a dog.

1262
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:52,325
- When did all this start?
- I don't know. A long time ago.

1263
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:57,003
It's just that some people look at old rusty
scrap metal and say, "Ah, that's just junk."

1264
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:58,571
But I see something else.

1265
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:00,725
Oh!

1266
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:03,884
That's beautiful! I love that.

1267
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:05,885
Excuse me, Mr. Sharp.

1268
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:08,202
You have a phone call
from a Mr. Dante Slate.

1269
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:09,566
Please tell him I'm busy.

1270
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:14,567
I'm afraid he insisted that it was quote, "mad
important," and that "shit just got real."

1271
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:18,331
Maybe you should take it
because it's mad important.

1272
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:19,720
Shit just got real.

1273
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:21,570
Heh. Okay.

1274
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:27,726
- Am I missing something here?
- What?

1275
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:30,121
Dante just told you
you're playing the Consol Center.

1276
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:32,601
- Yeah?
- And you act more nervous than excited.

1277
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:34,603
No, listen, I'm excited.

1278
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:37,240
I don't drive a lot at night
and I'm concentrating.

1279
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:38,521
This is gonna be huge...

1280
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:44,090
- Unh. Ooh.
- Sally!

1281
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:47,007
Are you okay?
No, you're cut up here.

1282
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:51,125
I never saw that guy. He came out of nowhere.
I swear to God, I never saw him. Jesus!

1283
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:55,445
You guys all right?

1284
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:56,847
You guys Okay?

1285
01:09:57,040 --> 01:10:03,810
Pay-per-view! Pay-per-view! Pay-per-view!
- It's gonna be real. Can you believe this?

1286
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:06,406
I'm not believing
you brought this boy to the bar.

1287
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:07,766
We're going to the movies.

1288
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:10,924
We will. We're just gonna celebrate
for a little bit, okay?

1289
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:12,809
Keep an eye on him, Joey, okay?

1290
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:24,130
Now you all have to chug!

1291
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:25,685
Now we all have to chug!

1292
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:33,962
Let's you and I get out of here.

1293
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:35,730
Well, I can't, I got him, so...

1294
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:37,928
He's fine. He's having fun.

1295
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:39,923
Look. Time of his life.

1296
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:43,646
Come on.

1297
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:47,330
We'll be quick about it.

1298
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:55,243
What do you think? Will it leave a scar?

1299
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:59,849
Well, it's running right along your
hairline, so I doubt you'll notice a thing.

1300
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,685
- Unless I go bald.
- Which, of course, you won't.

1301
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:05,361
You won't, I promise. But if you do...

1302
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:10,287
you're gonna be one smoking hot bald lady with
a little scar that I'd love to hang outwith.

1303
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:12,681
- Okay. You folks have a good evening.
- Same.

1304
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:14,681
- Thank you.
- Look at the two of you.

1305
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:16,211
Who would have thunk it?

1306
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:17,885
Lightning, hi.

1307
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:19,366
- Good to see you, Sally.
- Hi.

1308
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:21,682
Strange how life works out, huh?

1309
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:25,168
Oh, I'm flashing on to a stripper
I knew once in Korea.

1310
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:29,127
She never charged me.
Not even for the most daring requests.

1311
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:31,726
I keep hoping
I'd run into her again someday.

1312
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:35,202
- Her and her ping-pong ball.
- Ooh. Hey.

1313
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:38,204
I'm just saying, seeing the two
of you together gives me hope.

1314
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:40,089
Aw, that's sweet.

1315
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:42,083
- No, it's not.
- I think.

1316
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:43,890
You look good.
So how you feeling?

1317
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:47,726
Oh, I'm fine. I'm fine.
No big deal at all. - Good.

1318
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:51,640
Listen, can I talk to you for a minute?

1319
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:54,891
- So, what'd you want to talk about?
- Call it.

1320
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:57,164
Come on, I wasn't paying attention.

1321
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,209
When were you going to tell me
you're blind in one eye?

1322
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:06,481
How'd you know?

1323
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:10,087
How'd I know? When that bum bitch-slapped
you at the UFC fight.

1324
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:13,926
A two-year-old could've seen that coming.
When were you gonna tell me?

1325
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:15,286
What happened?

1326
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:20,767
A crucible blew up at the yard
a couple of years ago.

1327
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:24,763
Detached the retina. I
thought it would heal.

1328
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:29,447
I figured I could get by. - "Get by"?
Not only did you put Sally at risk...

1329
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:32,570
if he finds out he can hit you
on the right, he can kill you.

1330
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:35,849
Then I go to my left.
I need to do this, Light.

1331
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:43,284
Look, I know you're doing this for my sake
and I appreciate it. Believe me.

1332
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:46,445
It's too dangerous.

1333
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:50,569
We gotta call off the fight.

1334
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:05,246
I'm tired. Have you seen Kid?

1335
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:08,603
No. You know, go over there
and try his office.

1336
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:11,766
He's cute.

1337
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:13,410
You're cute.

1338
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:15,767
You look exactly like Angelina Jolie.

1339
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:24,926
Kid?

1340
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:26,491
You in here?

1341
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:27,880
Kid?

1342
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:57,646
Trey!

1343
01:13:58,360 --> 01:13:59,964
- What are you doing?
- You scared me!

1344
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:01,366
Stop the car!

1345
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:04,649
Why is your shirt off? - Stop the
car. Turn around and stop the car.

1346
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:07,531
- I can't reach the brakes, Grandpa!
- Don't call me Grandpa.

1347
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:10,524
- Get off the seat and press the brake.
- Sir! Go on! Get it!

1348
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:11,966
Press the brake down there.

1349
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:16,164
Go down and press the brake.
Press the brake!

1350
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:19,962
- Ugh.
- Please don't tell my dad.

1351
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:23,363
Oh, no, no. Never. This is our big
dude secret. Never. Lifelong.

1352
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:28,001
Uh-oh.

1353
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:29,844
Oh, my goodness.

1354
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,684
- Lightning's right.
- Why is he right?

1355
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:34,491
- Why is he right and I'm wrong?
- You can't do this fight.

1356
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:38,565
I'm in the best shape I've been in
2O years. - You can't risk it. Why?

1357
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:41,849
What have you wanted most
for the last 3O years?

1358
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,081
This fight...

1359
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:45,444
or something else?

1360
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:50,006
Excuse me.

1361
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:51,685
Trey? Trey?

1362
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:53,086
Dad!

1363
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:56,041
I turned my back, like, for a minute.
That was it.

1364
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:59,727
Turn your back in a bar?
What'd you say to me? What did you say?

1365
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:02,929
You said, "Dinner, maybe a movie."
Then you took my son to a bar.

1366
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:06,402
Dad, it's not his fault.
Or the naked lady's. - What?

1367
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:11,761
One night I ask you to step up, like a
father, and you can't keep it together.

1368
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:14,969
Come on, BJ. Nobody got hurt.
Everybody's okay. Come on.

1369
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:17,600
"Everybody's okay"?
Who's okay? I'm not okay.

1370
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:19,444
Kid, all right? It's my son.

1371
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:22,570
He means everything to me.
A concept you would never understand.

1372
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:24,927
- Come on.
- No, no. Listen to me.

1373
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:27,327
I'm gonna need you
to stay away from us, okay?

1374
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:30,723
You stay away from me.
You stay away from my son. That's it.

1375
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:44,443
Hey! Look at you.
Still alive, defying the odds. Heh.

1376
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:49,567
Ha, ha. Good one. Makes it a lot easier
for me to say what I gotta say.

1377
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:52,447
- He's out.
- "Out"? What do you mean "out"?

1378
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:55,001
- Fight's off. See you.
- "See you"?

1379
01:15:55,160 --> 01:16:00,121
Hey! Wait, ain't no damn "see you." Get back
here, you wrinkled, Hobbit-faced son of a bitch.

1380
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:01,401
I got a contract.

1381
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:03,722
- Razor is gonna fight.
- He's not gonna fight.

1382
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:08,169
Take some of the money your father skimmed
off Razor, get yourself a new guy.

1383
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:09,970
Razor's not gonna fight.

1384
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:12,327
You know what?
Screw you and screw my dad.

1385
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:14,608
You think you the only one
that got ripped off? Huh?

1386
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:18,765
Only thing my dad left me was a bad reputation,
which is why I need this to happen.

1387
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:22,003
I got a boy in private school,
which means he has white friends...

1388
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:24,083
which means he wants
white people shit.

1389
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:27,369
He asked me for a bar mitzvah.
Any idea how expensive that shit is?

1390
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:28,607
It's expensive!

1391
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:34,486
I feel your pain and I'm sorry your father was
such a prick, but Razor's not doing the fight.

1392
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:37,807
Let me tell you something.
I'll tell you what's...

1393
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:39,166
I'm talking to you.

1394
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:42,682
You not even gonna storm off
in a fast fashion? You gonna walk slow?

1395
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:45,005
For you to walk off makes me look...

1396
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:48,802
Oh, shit!

1397
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:51,128
Yo, I gotta take the car back?

1398
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:55,088
<i>Gone astray is the bluebird.</i>

1399
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:59,643
<i>Here to stay is the new bird.</i>

1400
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:04,164
<i>He sings a love song
As we go along</i>

1401
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:12,728
Dante. This better be good news
because I can't handle anything bad.

1402
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:17,610
- Where are you, Sally Rose?
- Hey.

1403
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:18,807
H9)'-

1404
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:21,406
- I've got a really great idea.
- Okay, let's hear it.

1405
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:22,607
How about this?

1406
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:24,569
Ow. Heh, ow.

1407
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:25,926
- We go out of town.
- Yeah?

1408
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:28,560
- Let's get out of here.
- Okay. Let's do it. Where?

1409
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:32,202
Do you remember how we always loved
the Adirondacks and we never went?

1410
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:33,964
- Yeah.
- Millions of times, right?

1411
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:35,246
Right. Millions of leaves.

1412
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:37,767
- And we regretted it, right?
- Yeah.

1413
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:40,406
Well, okay, what? No more regrets?

1414
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:43,323
Jesus! Aah!

1415
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:47,326
You gonna quit again?
Again, you're gonna quit?

1416
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:49,847
- Get out of here, Kid.
- No way. I don't think so.

1417
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:53,402
No, no. I'm not gonna get out of here
till you say you're gonna fight me.

1418
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:58,208
Oh! What are you doing, you moron? - Oh,
will you look...? I can't believe this.

1419
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:01,609
- Get out of here, Kid.
- Is that why you quit? Because of her?

1420
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:06,405
- Because of her? Did she make you quit?
- Henry.

1421
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:12,921
Hey, you made me wait 3O years to prove
to the world I could kick your ass.

1422
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:14,884
And that's what I'm gonna do,
kick your ass.

1423
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:17,447
- You're gonna move on. Move on!
- What, move on?

1424
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:20,763
Now that you got her, you want me
to move on? And what do I got?

1425
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:22,121
Nothing. Nothing.

1426
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:24,931
How do you live with yourself
knowing that we tied?

1427
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:28,290
There was no grudge match.
You never beat me.

1428
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:30,408
I was there! He kicked your ass!

1429
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:34,810
He didn't kick my ass. He knew I wasn't
ready for that fight. He didn't do shit.

1430
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:36,962
I lost because I was out of shape.

1431
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:39,566
The first one, I kicked his ass
because I was in shape.

1432
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:41,563
- You're pathetic.
- "You're pathetic."

1433
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:44,451
Go ahead, tell her! Tell her! Tell her!

1434
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:47,126
- He wasn't ready.
- Yeah, see?

1435
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:50,481
You were afraid of that fight. - Not
even a little. I was gonna knock you out!

1436
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:54,889
- Yeah? Well, let's do it now, then!
- Look at us. What are you talking about?

1437
01:18:55,080 --> 01:18:56,764
Yeah, look at us! We're not dead!

1438
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:59,327
Everybody's laughing! The
world's laughing! - Right.

1439
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:04,008
But we're not dead. In fact, this whole thing
has made me feel more alive than ever!

1440
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:05,641
You? What about you?

1441
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:08,161
- Huh? Don't let her get in the way.
- Leave her out of it.

1442
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:11,041
- Or what? You're not gonna fight?
- Leave her out of it. You and me.

1443
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:13,481
- Yeah! It's me and you! Right!
- You're a child.

1444
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:18,846
What are you doing? Give him his balls back!
Let him fight me! Let him reclaim his manhood!

1445
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,002
Please, I'm begging you. I'm begging you.

1446
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:26,007
This is our last chance. Let's finish this
once and for all. Come on. Come on!

1447
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:28,287
Come on.

1448
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:31,324
It ain't gonna happen.

1449
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:33,126
Wha...?

1450
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:35,124
What are you doing?

1451
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:41,565
I'm done. Come on.

1452
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:12,247
Hey.

1453
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:14,802
Don't make a mess,
or I have to clean it up.

1454
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:18,885
Walter. Are you working here now?
I didn't know that.

1455
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:23,927
Yeah, man. You know, well, it's always
been my life passion, to wait tables.

1456
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:25,969
Well, a job's a job, right?

1457
01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:27,485
- I am not complaining.
- Right.

1458
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:29,085
I'm happy to have a job.

1459
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:31,841
It would kill me
if I couldn't bet on you, man.

1460
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:37,401
I don't know about the betting. You know,
things happen. You never know for sure.

1461
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:40,922
Me and a bunch of guys from the plant,
we're gonna be in the nosebleeds.

1462
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:42,127
That's nice of you.

1463
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:46,080
Don't let this high-paying job fool you.
We could all use a win.

1464
01:20:46,240 --> 01:20:49,403
- And that sorry-ass burger is on me.
- Ha-ha-ha.

1465
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:51,927
- Be cool, man.
- All right, man.

1466
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:36,286
I got it.

1467
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:40,843
Hey, Trey. Let's go! Breakfast is on the table.
I don't wanna be waiting on you. Five minutes.

1468
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:42,201
Okay, Dad.

1469
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:46,089
- Hey.-
- Hey.-

1470
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:49,290
- You're BJ?
- Yeah, that's right. How you doing?

1471
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:52,001
Mom, she's told me all about you.

1472
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:53,446
You know, recently.

1473
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:55,803
- You look like her.
- Really?

1474
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:57,007
No, not really.

1475
01:21:57,160 --> 01:21:59,162
Heh. I was gonna say. Come on inside.

1476
01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:01,368
Hey, Ma, Razor's here.

1477
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:03,608
Can I get you something? Some juice?

1478
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:05,444
No, I'm okay.

1479
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:09,491
Listen, don't tell my morn I said this.
If she knew, she'd stab me with a fork...

1480
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:13,440
but I think she's really glad you're
around. She thinks you're a good guy.

1481
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:16,285
I don't know,
I just wanted you to know that.

1482
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:19,326
- Thank you. I like that.
- Good.

1483
01:22:19,480 --> 01:22:20,845
Hey, Ma.

1484
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,641
Excuse me. Heh.
I'm gonna let you guys be.

1485
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:25,847
Okay.

1486
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:31,091
- Good kid.
- He's a good boy.

1487
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:34,204
I'm gonna fight.

1488
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:38,130
Don't let him use me
to shame you into doing this.

1489
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:40,851
I'm not. I'm not.

1490
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:43,605
Not at all.

1491
01:22:44,240 --> 01:22:47,767
I made so many mistakes, Sally.
I made so many.

1492
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:51,003
Maybe I shouldn't have quit boxing
3O years ago.

1493
01:22:51,160 --> 01:22:53,925
Maybe I should've spent more time with you.
I ignored you so much.

1494
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:57,004
Maybe I could've forgiven you
and helped raise your kid.

1495
01:22:57,200 --> 01:22:59,726
Maybe I could've done so many things
that I didn't do.

1496
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:02,850
I just don't wanna make any more mistakes.
I'm done with that.

1497
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,765
I let him take from me...

1498
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:09,562
the two things that mattered most:

1499
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:12,849
You and boxing. I just shut it out.

1500
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:16,642
I don't even have a TV.

1501
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:17,921
Can you believe that?

1502
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:21,527
Because I'm afraid I might flip
to a fight by accident...

1503
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:25,042
and be embarrassed because I'm a
fighter. I was born to be a fighter.

1504
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:27,328
I had some talent. I did.

1505
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:30,046
And I just walked away so early.

1506
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:36,485
I love you.

1507
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:39,682
Always have. Always will.

1508
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:43,806
You're stuck with me, believe me.

1509
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:49,971
But I've always regretted
not beating Kid at his best.

1510
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:54,441
No matter how hard you guys work,
it won't be your best.

1511
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:57,049
It's the best we got.

1512
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:04,807
Then go kick his ass.

1513
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,207
Well, since you put it like that.

1514
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:12,889
Heh, he's a dead man.

1515
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:32,040
Stay left.

1516
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:33,647
Stay left.

1517
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:36,564
Left. Left!

1518
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:05,204
Bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo!

1519
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:35,886
I think I might be ready.

1520
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:39,881
Yeah, you're ready.
You're a one-eyed monster.

1521
01:25:43,160 --> 01:25:44,491
Agh!

1522
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:47,962
Okay, so this is my VIP section,
I need to fill it with VIPs. Understand?

1523
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:50,561
I want a Kardashian.
Give me a big-tittied Playmate.

1524
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:54,088
Whatever pussy actor
that played a boxer in a movie, I want him.

1525
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:55,924
- Lou, you got anybody?
- My mother.

1526
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:58,924
These are VIP. That woman can't see.
I can put her up top. She can hear.

1527
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:01,640
- She's looking forward to this.
- I'm not gonna waste that time.

1528
01:26:01,680 --> 01:26:03,250
Down! Set.

1529
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:06,246
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1530
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:07,481
BJ, you got a visitor.

1531
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:11,405
They're yours, coach.

1532
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:13,286
All right, listen up!

1533
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:22,121
Look, I know you got every right
to hate me. And I don't blame you.

1534
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:25,802
But I need you now.
I need you in my corner.

1535
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:27,850
You're the best person for me.

1536
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:31,207
I know I wasn't there for you and Trey.

1537
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:35,327
I can't take that back. I can't fix it.

1538
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,365
I brought him these.

1539
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:43,602
- Butterscotch jellybeans.
- Heh.

1540
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:46,087
Figure he's old enough now.

1541
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:48,925
Yeah, you're really not very
good at this. - No, I'm not.

1542
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:52,640
But I'm trying, you know.

1543
01:26:54,640 --> 01:26:56,244
And I brought this too.

1544
01:26:56,400 --> 01:27:00,769
I collected these over the years.
Just so you know the whole story.

1545
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:28,289
Hello again, everybody. I'm Jim Lampley
and welcome to Pittsburgh...

1546
01:27:28,440 --> 01:27:33,002
where a raucous sold-out crowd
has assembled for this unique grudge match.

1547
01:27:33,160 --> 01:27:36,004
Now, you stand to the left
and you keep him in your vision.

1548
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:37,810
- I will. Don't worry.
- I am worried.

1549
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:40,846
I love you like a son,
but I'm telling you right now:

1550
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:42,968
If you're taking a beating,
I'm throwing this in.

1551
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:45,009
- Don't do that.
- I'm gonna. I'm not asking.

1552
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:46,764
I am telling you.

1553
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:48,604
I'll also tell you something else.

1554
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:51,889
If you beat this mug, there's gonna be
a new television in the living room.

1555
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:53,121
I don't want one.

1556
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:55,362
Not for you. For me.

1557
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:10,329
I gotta tell you. It's probably the
shittiest wrap job I ever seen.

1558
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:13,211
Thought maybe you could
use a little help today, huh?

1559
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:15,647
Yeah, I could. Sure.

1560
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:33,723
Remember what I taught you.
Don't mess this up.

1561
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:35,882
Just sit back and relax.
I'm doing it perfect.

1562
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:38,560
- You've got fragile hands.
- You're a stubborn son of a bitch.

1563
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:40,967
Where do you think I got it from? Ha-ha-ha.

1564
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:44,725
- Guys, it's time.
- Showtime.

1565
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:46,401
Okay.

1566
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:50,930
- Be careful.
- Let's go! You ain't getting any younger!

1567
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:53,681
Nice.

1568
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:55,046
Time, guys.

1569
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:57,202
All right. All right, we'll be right there.

1570
01:28:57,360 --> 01:28:58,486
Breathe for me.

1571
01:28:58,680 --> 01:29:00,205
Breathe, that's it.

1572
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:01,930
Okay. That's it.

1573
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:04,250
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1574
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:05,965
You think I still got it?

1575
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:07,610
I think you still got it.

1576
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:10,764
Hey, somehow, you never lost it. All right?

1577
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:13,567
Good.

1578
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:16,760
Let's go to work.

1579
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:18,565
Let's do this.

1580
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:45,646
I guess the city of Pittsburgh missed all the
fanfare about what a joke this fight is.

1581
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:48,280
- This is some crowd.
- This could be good.

1582
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:51,891
Holy shit.

1583
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:53,606
Well put.

1584
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:04,089
Going without the scooter?

1585
01:30:04,240 --> 01:30:05,321
You kidding me?

1586
01:30:05,480 --> 01:30:08,962
With all that hot talent out there,
I can land me some snapper tonight.

1587
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:10,645
I just threw up in my mouth.

1588
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:27,526
<i>LAMPLEY". And here comes
Billy "The Kid" McDonnen.</i>

1589
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:35,923
<i>McDonnen, if you're dusting off your history
book, was 41-1 in his 12-year career.</i>

1590
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:38,526
<i>The one loss was against Sharp.</i>

1591
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:51,525
That's the Kid!

1592
01:30:58,280 --> 01:31:01,204
<i>And now, Razor Sharp
makes his way into the arena.</i>

1593
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:18,408
<i>It's not very often
we've seen a crowd in one city...</i>

1594
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:20,881
<i>so evenly divided, Jim.</i>

1595
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:35,406
<i>"LAMPLEY". In his nine-year career, Sharp
had 33 professional wins and only 1 loss.</i>

1596
01:31:35,560 --> 01:31:37,369
<i>And we all know who that was to.</i>

1597
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:43,085
Welcome to this evening's
very special main event.

1598
01:31:43,240 --> 01:31:45,129
Ladies and gentleman...

1599
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:50,605
let's get ready to rumble!

1600
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:54,000
Introducing first,
fighting out of the blue corner...

1601
01:31:54,160 --> 01:31:56,401
wearing his trademark
kelly-green trunks...

1602
01:31:56,560 --> 01:32:00,406
and weighing in at 175 pounds,
from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania...

1603
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:01,721
Yeah, Kid!

1604
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:03,962
"Fighting out of the
Kid McDonnen Auto Mall...

1605
01:32:04,160 --> 01:32:06,845
where zero percent financing
will knock you out."

1606
01:32:07,680 --> 01:32:09,444
- Open Sundays!
- Oh, come on, man.

1607
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:13,571
The former Light Heavyweight Champion
of the world...

1608
01:32:13,720 --> 01:32:19,124
Billy "The Kid" McDonnen!

1609
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:23,284
And fighting out of the red corner...

1610
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:25,044
wearing white with black...

1611
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:28,090
weighing in at 178 pounds...

1612
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:30,481
also from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania...

1613
01:32:32,120 --> 01:32:35,647
former Light Heavyweight World
Champion...

1614
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:41,125
Henry "Razor" Sharp!

1615
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:48,770
All right, boxers out.

1616
01:32:49,640 --> 01:32:51,642
Boxer out, one second.

1617
01:32:53,960 --> 01:32:56,964
All right, gentlemen.
You had my detailed instructions.

1618
01:32:57,120 --> 01:32:59,600
I expect you to obey
my commands at all times.

1619
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:01,325
Protect yourself at all times.

1620
01:33:01,480 --> 01:33:02,811
Are there any questions?

1621
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:05,440
Gutsy move going without a bra.

1622
01:33:05,640 --> 01:33:09,008
I've got a surprise for you when you
get home. I took a shit on your porch.

1623
01:33:09,160 --> 01:33:12,084
- We are live, guys. We are live right now.
- Touch them up.

1624
01:33:12,680 --> 01:33:14,489
Is this about me and you? Or her?

1625
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:17,009
Me and you.

1626
01:33:17,160 --> 01:33:20,130
Oh, thank God. I thought he was
gonna say it was about the shit.

1627
01:33:24,680 --> 01:33:25,966
And here we go.

1628
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:29,806
Box!

1629
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:33,603
<i>"LAMPLEY". We can expect both men
to feel each other out at this point.</i>

1630
01:33:38,920 --> 01:33:41,810
<i>"MERCHANT". Sharp not looking very Sharp
at the moment.</i>

1631
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:44,361
<i>Well, that's no surprise
after</i> a <i>30-year layoff.</i>

1632
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:48,841
<i>And there's</i> a <i>wild hook by Billy
"The Kid" that misses by</i> a <i>mile.</i>

1633
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,048
Don't load up, Pop! Don't load up!

1634
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:53,487
<i>Lots of rust on both sides.</i>

1635
01:33:53,640 --> 01:33:56,723
<i>"LAMPLEY". What do you think of this
It's not pretty at all.</i>

1636
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:58,723
Let's go, let's go.
Let's start the fight.

1637
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:05,282
<i>"LAMPLEY". Now Sharp stepping forward
a little more assertively behind that jab.</i>

1638
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:06,805
<i>McDonnen says, "Come on."</i>

1639
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:08,724
Come on, Kid! Roll and throw.

1640
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:10,723
<i>Sharp jabbing, then backing up.</i>

1641
01:34:12,040 --> 01:34:14,566
<i>- That's it!
- Razor was hurt by that punch!</i>

1642
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:18,321
- Dear God.
- And, boom, <i>there it</i> is.

1643
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:21,723
- Kid's famous left hook finally showed up.
- Might've <i>hurt</i> Razor.

1644
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:25,322
- Razor appears cut above his right eye.
- Razor is cut.

1645
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:31,161
Come on!

1646
01:34:36,440 --> 01:34:37,441
<i>"LAMPLEY". Bell sounds.</i>

1647
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:39,443
- What?
- Hey.

1648
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:44,091
<i>"LAMPLEY". That was a hard right hand
immediately after the bell.</i>

1649
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:50,207
- That will lead to a point deduction.
- That can cost the Kid a round.

1650
01:34:50,360 --> 01:34:51,600
Give him some water.

1651
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:54,286
- You're doing real good, you pussy.
- That's not helping.

1652
01:34:54,440 --> 01:34:56,124
I'm 800 years old, I say what I want.

1653
01:34:56,280 --> 01:34:57,960
- Can you stop the bleeding?
- For a while.

1654
01:34:58,080 --> 01:34:59,969
What are you doing,
hitting him after the bell?

1655
01:35:00,120 --> 01:35:02,726
You're gonna get us thrown out.
I need you to be smart.

1656
01:35:02,920 --> 01:35:04,684
- All right?
- Relax.

1657
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:07,611
- He's gonna figure you out.
- Either way, I'm taking him out.

1658
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:09,404
- Do it quick.
- Right.

1659
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,120
<i>"LAMPLEY". And now round two
is about to get underway.</i>

1660
01:35:21,200 --> 01:35:24,283
<i>MERCHANT". Have to give round one to Sharp
after that foul.</i>

1661
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:25,851
Roll and throw, Kid!

1662
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:29,643
<i>"LAMPLEY". And Razor Sharp will waste
no time pressing his advantage.</i>

1663
01:35:30,640 --> 01:35:31,926
Come on, Kid. Move that head.

1664
01:35:32,120 --> 01:35:33,326
- Unh!
- Oh!

1665
01:35:34,240 --> 01:35:36,811
<i>"LAMPLEY".
Razor is unrelenting. Pounding away.</i>

1666
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,765
- All right! All right!
- Roll and throw!

1667
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:42,164
<i>"LAMPLEY".
Razor continues to unload.</i>

1668
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:46,606
- Down goes Kid on a massive left hand.
- Oh, <i>yes.</i>

1669
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:49,441
<i>Referee Pat Russell will pick up the count.</i>

1670
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:51,648
You got him! You got him! Now finish him!

1671
01:35:52,160 --> 01:35:54,083
<i>The Kid is taking a ton of punishment...</i>

1672
01:35:54,240 --> 01:35:56,402
<i>but that's always
been a part of his game.</i>

1673
01:35:56,600 --> 01:35:59,524
- He's stronger than he looks.
- I'm okay, I'm okay.

1674
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,445
<i>He's got Kid in trouble.</i>

1675
01:36:05,160 --> 01:36:07,845
<i>- "JONES". Oh, got him.
- Down he goes!</i>

1676
01:36:08,760 --> 01:36:10,649
Get over there! Two!

1677
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:13,690
"Why in the hell did I do this?"

1678
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:15,604
Roll and throw! Do it now!

1679
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:19,606
You have got to start slipping punches
and letting your hands go. Roll and throw.

1680
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:22,491
- You hear me? Roll and throw.
- Seven! You getting up?

1681
01:36:22,640 --> 01:36:24,210
Eight! Walk to me.

1682
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:26,121
You okay, Kid?

1683
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:27,691
Show me something. Box!

1684
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:35,005
Get out of the corner! It's a trap!
Get out of the corner!

1685
01:36:35,160 --> 01:36:36,571
Now! Right now!

1686
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:38,201
<i>"LAMPLEY". Oh, boy!</i>

1687
01:36:38,360 --> 01:36:39,725
- Attaway, Kid!
- Goddamn it!

1688
01:36:41,960 --> 01:36:43,405
Now, let your hands go!
That's it!

1689
01:36:50,920 --> 01:36:52,570
- Bell! Time!
- No boxing here.

1690
01:36:52,720 --> 01:36:54,529
<i>This is an all-out war.</i>

1691
01:36:54,680 --> 01:36:55,727
Let's go, baby!

1692
01:36:56,200 --> 01:36:58,567
Attaboy! Attaboy! Way to work!

1693
01:36:58,720 --> 01:37:00,484
Listen, he's got you figured out.

1694
01:37:00,640 --> 01:37:03,405
- So what?
- So I'm gonna call the fight.

1695
01:37:03,560 --> 01:37:06,848
He's slipping. Now you're fighting smart.
Keep that pressure on him.

1696
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:08,411
Do not let up. Do not let up.

1697
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:11,484
- You want to get your head bashed in?
- Don't worry about it.

1698
01:37:11,640 --> 01:37:14,086
- I'm watching that.
- It's all right.

1699
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:15,480
I'm fine.

1700
01:37:15,680 --> 01:37:17,400
He's going down.
He's a sucker for the left.

1701
01:37:17,560 --> 01:37:19,244
Stay on him.
Breathe for me. That's it.

1702
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:41,841
<i>I have to give that round to Kid.</i>

1703
01:37:53,240 --> 01:37:55,402
<i>That round dominated by Sharp.</i>

1704
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:25,724
<i>"LAMPLEY". It's been a hellacious display
of courage by both fighters.</i>

1705
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:37,480
<i>Kid has Razor in trouble.</i>

1706
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:55,126
That's it! Bell!

1707
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:57,091
I'm taking you out.

1708
01:38:59,320 --> 01:39:01,448
- Are you stupid?
- Calm him down!

1709
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:08,649
- He's done. Best man won.
- No, you're beating a guy with one eye.

1710
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:10,211
- That's all.
- What do you mean?

1711
01:39:10,360 --> 01:39:11,885
Your eye's almost swollen shut.

1712
01:39:12,040 --> 01:39:14,850
Didn't work anyway.
At least you don't have to cut me.

1713
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:18,447
- You don't listen to a thing I say, do you?
- Not this time. He's hurting too. He is.

1714
01:39:18,600 --> 01:39:21,365
Sharp's right eye is badly swollen...

1715
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:23,204
fighting half blind.

1716
01:39:23,360 --> 01:39:26,807
Every time you come from the left, you
knock the snot out of him. He can't see it.

1717
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:28,530
- That's bullshit.
- It's not bullshit.

1718
01:39:28,680 --> 01:39:30,205
- How do you know?
- Mom told me.

1719
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:32,607
What do you think? She made it up?
That's the way it is.

1720
01:39:32,760 --> 01:39:34,410
It don't matter. I'm kicking his ass.

1721
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:36,881
What are you gonna do that for?
You attack his blind eye.

1722
01:39:37,040 --> 01:39:39,120
Everyone's gonna say
you didn't beat him at his best.

1723
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:41,408
You're not gonna be able to sleep at night!

1724
01:39:41,560 --> 01:39:43,608
Screw that.
I'm taking what's coming to me.

1725
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:46,570
Kid, do this right.
Stand in front where he can see you!

1726
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:50,251
Go knock him out!
Now, hurry up! I gotta pee.

1727
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:54,007
Box!

1728
01:39:54,160 --> 01:39:56,891
<i>"LAMPLEY".
Final round! Too close to call!</i>

1729
01:39:59,240 --> 01:40:01,720
<i>So many times in a three-fight rivalry...</i>

1730
01:40:01,880 --> 01:40:04,167
<i>the rubber match is the best.</i>

1731
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:07,245
<i>- Kid on the attack.
- No!</i>

1732
01:40:08,240 --> 01:40:09,321
Oh!

1733
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:10,726
What a pounding!

1734
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:12,841
Lightning!

1735
01:40:15,360 --> 01:40:16,930
<i>"LAMPLEY". Sharp is in trouble.</i>

1736
01:40:18,760 --> 01:40:20,410
<i>Razor backpedals woozily.</i>

1737
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:22,927
<i>And down goes Razor.</i>

1738
01:40:23,120 --> 01:40:25,080
<i>- Sharp was hurt by that punch.
- It's your fight!</i>

1739
01:40:57,480 --> 01:40:58,766
You wanna keep going?

1740
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:01,602
Yeah. You bet your ass.

1741
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:03,641
Hey, you can't do that!

1742
01:41:03,800 --> 01:41:04,961
I just did. Come on.

1743
01:41:05,160 --> 01:41:06,605
<i>Kid lifted Razor off the canvas.</i>

1744
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:12,245
What's he doing?

1745
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:17,483
Unbelievable! In all my years
of covering boxing, I've never seen it.

1746
01:41:17,640 --> 01:41:19,005
- I told him to do that!
- Oh!

1747
01:41:19,160 --> 01:41:21,003
That's my idea! I told him to do that!

1748
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:24,001
<i>Now, Pat Russell
is gonna confer with the judges.</i>

1749
01:41:24,760 --> 01:41:26,171
Give me those gloves.

1750
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:30,800
And now the ref, in good sportsmanship,
is gonna wave them on.

1751
01:41:31,320 --> 01:41:33,766
I'm right in front of you. No excuses.

1752
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:35,607
No excuses.

1753
01:41:38,360 --> 01:41:40,840
<i>They touch gloves one last time.</i>

1754
01:41:44,920 --> 01:41:47,366
Now Kid has stopped ducking
and going to Sharp's left.

1755
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:51,127
He's playing right into Sharp's strength.
Almost like he's challenging him.

1756
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:55,568
Nail him! Now!

1757
01:41:56,880 --> 01:41:59,281
<i>- That's it!
- Kid attacking with the left hook!</i>

1758
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:00,680
<i>Sharp is in trouble.</i>

1759
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:05,126
The fighters exchange a flurry.
Brutal stuff. Finally, toe-to-toe!

1760
01:42:09,120 --> 01:42:10,804
<i>Fifteen seconds left.</i>

1761
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:15,486
<i>Oh, there's a massive
right hand by Razor...</i>

1762
01:42:15,640 --> 01:42:17,404
and Kid is on the canvas.
He is down!

1763
01:42:17,560 --> 01:42:19,210
Yeah, yeah!

1764
01:42:33,720 --> 01:42:35,563
<i>Kid is not getting up.</i>

1765
01:42:35,720 --> 01:42:37,245
<i>This fight could be over!</i>

1766
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:52,243
Hey, Kid. No <i>mas?</i>

1767
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:56,525
<i>Razor pulls Kid up before the count of 10.</i>

1768
01:42:56,680 --> 01:42:58,330
Oh, for God's sakes.

1769
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:04,201
I might actually cry now.

1770
01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:07,563
Oh, shit, I'm cry...
It's coming down a little bit.

1771
01:43:12,480 --> 01:43:14,562
- I didn't need your help.
- Right.

1772
01:43:24,080 --> 01:43:25,206
Are you okay, Kid?

1773
01:43:26,040 --> 01:43:27,280
Not really.

1774
01:43:28,280 --> 01:43:30,806
I'm dying, but I've never felt better.

1775
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:33,247
Heh. Hey, you did the right thing.

1776
01:43:33,400 --> 01:43:34,640
Thanks, son.

1777
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:36,286
I love you, Dad.

1778
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:38,847
Well, I'll never call you a pussy again.

1779
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,048
- Stupid, that's what I'll call you.
- Heh.

1780
01:43:41,200 --> 01:43:43,646
- I am so proud of you!
- Oh, yeah.

1781
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:44,961
I told you it'd be okay.

1782
01:43:51,520 --> 01:43:54,808
Ladies and gentlemen,
we go to the scorecards.

1783
01:43:54,960 --> 01:44:00,330
Judge Alfredo Padillo scores
it 92-91 for Sharp.

1784
01:44:00,480 --> 01:44:04,405
Judge James Caballa scores it
90 to 89...

1785
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:06,483
for McDonnen.

1786
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:09,691
And Judge Marco Rosario scores it...

1787
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:12,286
91 to 89...

1788
01:44:12,440 --> 01:44:15,683
to the winner by split decision...

1789
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:20,243
Henry "Razor" Sharp!

1790
01:44:22,120 --> 01:44:24,407
Sorry you lost, Kid.

1791
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:25,971
No. He didn't lose nothing.

1792
01:44:27,120 --> 01:44:29,122
Trey, call me Grandpa.

1793
01:44:41,320 --> 01:44:43,129
Guess it was a mistake, picking me up.

1794
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:44,770
No, I wanted you at your best.

1795
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:46,371
Well, you got it.

1796
01:44:47,320 --> 01:44:49,288
- Thanks for the shot.
- Anytime.

1797
01:44:50,160 --> 01:44:51,685
But I still hate you.

1798
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:53,649
I hate you too.

1799
01:44:54,200 --> 01:44:55,281
Wanna do this again?

1800
01:44:56,160 --> 01:44:58,208
- Definitely not.
- You sure?

1801
01:44:59,680 --> 01:45:00,727
Yeah.

1802
01:45:02,040 --> 01:45:03,929
Bullshit! Fix!

1803
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:05,844
- Who paid off those judges?
- Light!

1804
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:07,526
- What?
- Light! We won.

1805
01:45:07,680 --> 01:45:08,966
Who did? What?

1806
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:10,167
We won.

1807
01:45:10,360 --> 01:45:12,840
- We won? Get the hell out of here!
- Heh, no.

1808
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:15,365
- Goddamn hearing aid.
- Yeah.

1809
01:45:29,360 --> 01:45:32,045
See? This is why I don't do TV.
I'm going to Sally's.

1810
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:34,009
Sit down.
There's gonna be a big finish.

1811
01:45:34,160 --> 01:45:38,131
<i>I</i> wanna know if you're <i>with me.</i>

1812
01:45:38,280 --> 01:45:40,521
<i>Can't stand stickin' around.</i>

1813
01:45:40,680 --> 01:45:42,011
<i>Hey!</i>

1814
01:45:44,200 --> 01:45:46,567
- Now I wish I was blind in both eyes.
- Oh, wow.

1815
01:45:48,520 --> 01:45:49,601
See you.

1816
01:45:50,200 --> 01:45:53,761
- He has a certain elegance, doesn't he?
- Yeah, a little bit. A little bit.

1817
01:46:01,320 --> 01:46:03,800
I guarantee you,
he's gonna get some snapper tonight.

1818
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:07,288
Dude, you're a pervert. Like, it goes
right to sex with you. I'm done.

1819
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:10,808
Give me a towel so I can get this
vinegar off my feet. It's strong!

1820
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:12,325
Why is it that strong?

1821
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:14,926
It might be bad.
I think the vinegar might be bad.

1822
01:46:21,640 --> 01:46:25,008
Listen. If you thought Grudgement Day
was big, then this is gonna be huge.

1823
01:46:25,160 --> 01:46:28,243
They're talking Wembley Stadium
for the rematch. Ninety thousand people.

1824
01:46:28,440 --> 01:46:30,488
I can get you seven figures, maybe eight.

1825
01:46:30,640 --> 01:46:33,484
Bottom line is I can get you guys paid.
What do you say?

1826
01:46:33,640 --> 01:46:35,961
- I'm in.
- That's what I'm talking about.

1827
01:46:36,120 --> 01:46:38,327
- What about you, Evander?
- No.

1828
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:41,927
Come on, Evander! So the man
went a little batshit and bit your ear off.

1829
01:46:42,120 --> 01:46:44,964
It's not like he liked the way
you tasted. - Taste like ass.

1830
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:47,009
Did you hear? You didn't taste good.

1831
01:46:47,160 --> 01:46:49,162
Mike, do me a favor?
Tell him you're sorry.

1832
01:46:49,320 --> 01:46:51,561
- I'm sorry.
- Mike, like you mean it.

1833
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:54,611
- Sorry.
- I felt that.

1834
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:56,564
- Come on, Evander. What do you say?
- No.

1835
01:46:59,880 --> 01:47:02,406
I get you one month at
the Playboy Mansion. - No.

1836
01:47:02,600 --> 01:47:05,171
Okay, final offer. I'll
throw in a Bentley. - No.

1837
01:47:06,680 --> 01:47:10,287
<i>- I'll</i> get you a part in Hangover IV.
- I'm listening.

1838
01:47:10,480 --> 01:47:12,164
- You son of a bitch.
- Now hold on!

1839
01:47:12,360 --> 01:47:13,850
- Guard your ears.
- Wait, Mike! No!
