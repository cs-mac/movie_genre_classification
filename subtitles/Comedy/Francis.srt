00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:14,431
"State Commercial Bank"

00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:33,214
Thank You.

00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:06,024
I appreciate it very much. Ms. Gordon.
Most helpful.

00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:08,560
We thought you had to know. 

00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:11,392
Absolutely you know we bankers can't be too careful.

00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,432
Give my best to the husband of yours.

00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,195
Thank You.

00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:30,640
Yeah? Yes sir.

00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:33,584 
Hey, Stirling, Mr. Munroe wants to you.

00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,656
"Out to lunch"

00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:47,195
You sent for me, sir?

00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:49,201
That's all Miss King.

00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:55,401
Sit down, young man.

00:02:56,776 --> 00:03:00,177
Stirling, how long have you been with this bank?

00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:03,613
About four years, sir.

00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:06,846
Counting the time before the war.
Four years.

00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:12,280
I'll go and speak frankly.  
There's a great deal of talk going around town,

00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,918
Talk that aren't good for you or the bank.

00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:17,724
- Yes sir. Oh, so you know about this?

00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:21,096
- Oh Yes sir. 
- Well, young man then you can understand.

00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:24,568
In the banking business, we can't be too careful.

00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:27,703
The talk's all nonsense of course.

00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:30,705
Oh, But sorry it's not nonsense.

00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:33,075
Aren't not ... What?

00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:35,580
I mean it's true, sir.

00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:38,147
But how can such an absurd ridiculous. 

00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,516
Stirling what's the matter with you.

00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:42,748
Well .. could I.. , could I tell you about it?

00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:45,814
- Tell me? 
– Yes, you just let me explain.

00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:51,421
- See here I'm an extremely busy man.
- But, sorry. It means my job.

00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:55,866
- Well, then ... take it brief..
- Yes sir.

00:03:55,935 --> 00:04:00,235
You see, sir. 
It all began a few years ago over in Burma.

00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:02,968
- Burma? 
- Yes sir.

00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:05,408
The jungle was the hottest I'd ever known at that day.

00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:09,114
Still there was no excuse for me a second lieutenant.

00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:12,583
Getting separated from my platoon.  
No excuse at all.

00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:16,748
<I> When I realized that I was alone </ i> <i> lost behind Jap lines ... </ i>

00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:18,950
<I> I was scared. </ I>

00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:20,959
<I> Then I thought </ i> <i> that my company commander... </ i>

00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:23,052
<I> would say when I told him </ i> <i> I lost my platoon. </ I>

00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:25,120
<I> and I was really scared.</ I>

00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:39,243
<I> At last I took refuge </ i> <i>under a tree. </ I>

00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,142
<I> I must have been exhausted, </ i> <i>because I fell asleep. </ I>

00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:49,622
<I> Our barrage woke me. </ I>

00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:51,623
<I> My mouth felt dry. </ I>

00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:55,955
<I> It's funny how wet you can be outside so dry inside. </ I>

00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:26,087
Hey, watch you, if you don't wanna live, I do.

00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,127
Keep your head down.

00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:33,899
Who said that?

00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,001
Who said that?

00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,560
I'd, here.

00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:42,975
Where you are? Come on or I'll shoot.

00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:48,537
Lieutenant.., you'd better put that gun up before you hurt somebody.

00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:51,208
- Who's speaking? 
- Me.

00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:56,087
- Who's me? 
– Me, The mule.

00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:01,689
Something ridiculous.

00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:05,891
Coming from a Second Lieutenant, that's all most ironic.

00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:13,799
- It must be a booby trap to some kind.. 
- You're all the know.

00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:18,207
But it's fantastic.... I don't believe it.

00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:20,444
Hey.

00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:25,016
- What are you? 
 - I'm just a army mule...

00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:27,552
.. and my name happens to be Francis.

00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:30,912
- Francis?

00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:34,760
- It's a girl's name.

00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:36,886
- Aha.. Let's keep sex out of it.

00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:40,865
The name is still Francis, with the an "I"

00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:44,334
- Where the sound?. 
- Why?

00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,134
Uh, it's some kind of a trick.

00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:49,197
Sent a mule that does talk.

00:06:58,217 --> 00:07:01,243
We are facing an extremely serious situation, uh?

00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,687
- I must decide what a course of action to take. 
- Brilliant Lieutenant..

00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,918
..smug deal of no bore no brilliant.

00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:13,727
I must be crazy I'm freaking if you can talk.

00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:19,597
The hit of my head must be worse than I thought.

00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:21,606
I get to get out of here.

00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,939
- Say.
- Uh?

00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,911
- Could you carry me out of here?

00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:39,057
Carry you? And slow myself up? Uh! Uh! Uhuh

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,452
But I'm an officer!

00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:44,792
A second lieutenant.

00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:47,560
Why wouldn't be very patriotic.

00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,567
You mean my life isn't worth saving?

00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:55,133
Well.. the question is.. would it be worth risking mine to do it.

00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,232
What do you mean?

00:07:56,309 --> 00:08:00,575
Is there a shortage of second lieutenants? Certainly not.

00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:03,774
The War Department have announced that got a lot surplus.

00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,148
But mules? Ehh.. That is a different story.

00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:08,779
Nooo. I just couldn't do it.

00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:11,551
It's not with my interest in furthering the war effort.

00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:25,168
All ears here!

00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:41,878 
- My leg, I've been hurt.
- This what happen.

00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:45,185
- By the tail of my Greta aunt Regret that won one Derby ... 

00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:48,591
.. how are leave you here from Jap space?

00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:51,687
- Go ahead go ahead, save yourself.

00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:56,264
- You know perfectly well I can't leave you now.

00:08:56,335 --> 00:09:00,294
Well, I thought you said I was just a second Lieutenant wasn't worth saving.

00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:05,208
- A whole name. Wouldn't you become a matter of principle.

00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:10,113
- Never mind then, come on, get on my back and I'll take you to an aid station.

00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:23,921
- Francis, I have you make this carefull, please.

00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:31,134
What as mulas goes through with a couple of straikes.

00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,642
- Lieutenant Stirling?
- Yes sir?

00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:45,878
- How's your leg?
- It's just a flesh wound Capitan.

00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:47,749
- I understand getting out of here in a couple of days.

00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,085
- Fine. Uh, cigarette?
- No, thank you.

00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:53,148
- Stirling ...

00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:55,523
- I am from G-2.

00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,756
- G-2?

00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,764
- What is intelligence wants of me?.

00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,833
- You lived quite an experience up there, didn't you?

00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:04,096
- Yes sir.

00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:07,435
- The men of my patrol ...did they all go well?
- They're all back safe and sound.

00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:11,609 
- So okay Lieutenant, those things can happen on patrol.

00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:15,044
- Where we were crawling along on the hillside sir, and then suddenly I was alone.

00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,741
- I was afraid the call out.

00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:19,148
- Lucky for you that mule found its way to headquarters.

00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:22,710
- Mule? Oh!, Francis.

00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:25,691
- Francis?

00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:29,387
- The mule, sir, Francis, he spelled it with an 'i'.

00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,689
- You seem to know quite a lot about this mule.

00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:34,699
- On what he told me sir.

00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:38,398
- What, who told you?

00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,065
- Francis?
- Yes sir. The mule.

00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:44,008
- That's what I thought you said.

00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:51,347
- But Lieutenant, this doesn't indicate there's anything the matter with your mind?

00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:53,385
Where's the reason, sir?

00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:58,151
- But.. what you just told me.. a mule talked to you?

00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:00,784
- He did, sir..
- You're sure that?

00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:04,819
- Yes sir. I.. I ain't believe it at first either but he really did.

00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:09,262
- Now.. we're.. take it easy, Lieutenant.  

00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:12,133
Just ... take it easy.

00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:31,923
- Well young feller How are you getting along?

00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:33,515
- Fine, sir.

00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:36,390
- A little bump on the head too didn't you.?
- Yes sir.

00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:39,158
- Doesn't seem do amount to a thing.
- No sir.

00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:44,260
- I hear you talk Captain Grant and the mule talk to you, it's that right?

00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,131
Yes sir.

00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,574
Well my patients like to have their little jokes.

00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:55,444
- But I wasn't joking, sir..
- Come lieutenant, this is no time for leg pulling.

00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:58,449
- There's a war going on you know mules can't talk.

00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:01,975
- Oh, that's what I thought, but this one talk to me.

00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:05,114
You mean the animal talk to you the way I'm speaking now?

00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:08,058
Maybe maybe not so loud sir.

00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:10,827
Tell me, Stirling ...

00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:13,59
Tell me Sterling is it just one particular mule who talks to you?

00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:17,295
- or do all the mules talk?
- Oh, just Francis, sir. 
- Francis?

00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:20,439
That's the mule's name...

00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:22,440
It spells it with an 'I'

00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:26,770
Do any other animals talk to you? Elephants, rabbits..

00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:29,007
..chickens, goldfish?

00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,106
No sir. Of course not.

00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:35,381
The very thought of such things talking is ridiculous isn't that young man?

00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:37,422
Yes sir.

00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:41,790
Lieutenant! yours is not an unusual case nothing unusual about it at all

00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:44,227
In no time we'll have you fixed up good as new.

Good morning, boys.

Samuel. Ben.

00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:02,506
Hi, Raymond.

00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:04,071
Feeling better?

00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:08,784

Colonel Plepper wants to see you.
Colonel Plepper?

00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:16,390
Yes, sit up, up, Psychiatrist.

00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:19,488
Psychiatrist? But I do not need a psychiatrist.

00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:21,499
Now, now, come along.

00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:40,817
Lieutenant ...

00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:42,820
This is Colonel Plepper.

00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,620
No, no my boy none of that, just sit down.

00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:49,718
Make yourself like at home.

Thank you sir.

00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,599
How long have you been with us Lieutenant? Let me see..

00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:57,593
Ten days.

00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:00,932
Huhum, I see you gain a pound per day?

00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,201
I've been on a condensed milk diet.

00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:07,702
Huhum, Remarkable look into ful man remarkable.

00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,872
You feel fatter?

00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:11,749
- Yes sir.
- It's perfectly natural.

00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:14,718
Wonderful the way the army is able to put weight on the men.

00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:17,620
This is go to the beautiful art chart.

00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:23,023
Now, Lieutenant ...

00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:26,656
Suppose you tell us all about your friend the mule, who talks, uh?

00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:35,134
Well, Colonel, sir, I must of been wrong about that.

00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:38,472
Just imagine it.
It could have been that bang on the head.

00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,637
Or perhaps I was just shell shocked.

00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,944
Oh no, we call it combat fatigue.

00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,149
You're thinking of the last war, Sterling.

00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:49,915
Well, I must begin fatigued.
But I'm perfectly all right now so.

00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:51,650
Of course you are.

00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:55,023
Why don't you report to Colonel Saunders, this afternoon, for assignment on duty?

00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:58,095
See how quickly the Army can do you?

00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,087 
Ohoh God

00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:27,648
Yeah.. Uhuh 

00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:32,423
Fine. Then I'll bring Miss. Gelder over right away.

00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:35,934
Your calls are all the way. The ladies of the Red Cross are waiting to welcome you.

00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:39,327
Oh, mercy. they are so kind to let me stay.

00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:41,100
Still under the wing of the army you know?

00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:43,539
Yes but maybe so little time before, we're sure that it's safe for you 

00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,736
to return to your father's trading post..

00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,714
I am so attached with the war and your trouble with me.

00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,115
Papa would be very grateful.

00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:55,983
If only we could find that, all we know you're all right.

00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:57,989
But who knows where he is?   

00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:01,117
The Japanese came in so fast we had to take to the hills ...

00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:03,718
we've scarcely time to pack up things.

00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:08,665
Then Papa and I got separated. 
I was looking for him when your patrol found me.

00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:10,895
We'll do everything we can to find your father.

00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,997
- In the meantime my idea we've better to get you settle.
 <I>- Merci </ i>, Colonel Saunders.

00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:17,542
<I> Merci encore </ i>, Colonel Hooker.

00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:40,865 
I hope you'll be comfortable in your quarters.

00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:43,524
Gentlemen.  

00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,805
I hope you are not too busy to attend the staff meeting this afternoon.

00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:02,046
- Know what have the Colonel that I haven't guys? 
- Ranck, Captain. Ranck.

00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:05,421
And me only a second Lieutenant.

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,393
And matter of reason for the staff meetings, gentlemen.

00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:14,393
Of course this opening in the intelligence action over the usual opportunity for an advancement.

00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:19,199
Gentleman I'd like to ask that any officer in this headquarters..

00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:23,765
..who feels too he has special qualifications for G2 work. ...  

00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,477
- Lieutenant Brimm?

00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,172
- Sir, I speak seven languages of the Far East.

00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,215
- I was a professor at Duke University.

00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:34,150
- Fine. Make a note, Lieutenant.
- Captain Norman?

00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:38,713
- I've spent nine years in Burma prospecting I know the country and the people.

00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:42,227
- Do you speak the language?-->
- Yes sir. All dialects, fluently. 

00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:44,819
Very good. Note that, Lieutenant.

00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,957
Lieutenant Stirling?

00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:52,431
- Second Lieutenant Stirling!
- Yes sir?

00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:55,735
Lieutenant, you have any special qualifications for intelligence work?

00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:57,901
No sir. None at all, sir.

00:17:57,976 --> 00:18:00,638
I do not even ... No, sir. None.

00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:08,913
G-2 Intelligence? 

00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:15,555
"Limit the City of Angels"

00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:32,836
You know it's hard to picture of you, a  young beautiful girl like you  ...

00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:34,811
...living in the jungle training post.

00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,782
- But you find it pretty dull?
- The jungle dull? Mai no...

00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:42,150
It is <i> mystérieuse, </ i> wonderful, thrilling. 

00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:45,918
And I'm afraid that all of the men around here don't find it so thrilling.

00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:49,859
Oh , that is because they are so lonely, nes pa?

00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:53,625
It is sacrilege the way that lots of sound would been a wasted.

00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:57,635
Yeah, I can hear the Colonel last two red corpse so yelling for reinforcements.

00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:59,295
Something reality in the fooll dish.

00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:01,965
It's in all their faces.

00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:06,043
A sort of ... sadness.

00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:09,376
Oh no, no, not sad, my dear, hunger.

00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:11,382
They are all hoping I'll drop dead.
Ooh..

00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:17,878
...and they're all so handsome, so attractive.

00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:21,448
Well, it is a good strategy if I did share you with them.

00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:24,228
Come out, I'll introduce you.

00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,492 
Hello.

00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:34,865
Hello.

00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:39,309 
Lieutenant Stirling?

00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:44,111
No no no no no I haven't sir, but it's wonderful. 
A pleasure, Lieutenant.

00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,583
Lieutenant Stirling , he's just been assigned to intelligence.

00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:50,016
Oh, and so very young too, my compliments Lieutenant.

00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:53,182
- Thank You.

00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:06,066
You must be Lieutenant Sterling's friend.

00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:09,235
Fascinating.

00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:11,936
Simply fascinating.

00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:14,979
Ehm, and you can to ask me to dance, Lieutenant?

00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:18,539
You mean you would? I, I mean would you?

00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:20,312
Me oui, but of course.

00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:24,287
After Lieutenant Colonel Sanders, and the two Majors, and ...

00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:26,950
Lieutenant. Lieutenant Stirling.

00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:33,361
Surprise Lieutenant, someone looking for you.

00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:44,468
Lieutenant Sterling was my favourite patience, such as unusual ...

00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:46,033
Shall We Dance?

00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:54,579
Lieutenant? The Colonels, the Majors, the Captains ...

00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:58,020
- What will they think?
- Oh, oh, what have I done?

00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,888
Forgive me, I'll take you right back.

00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:06,624
Me no, I like a masterful man that sweeps me away from everyone.

00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:11,735
Oh, gee, I did this night?

00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:20,077
"French"

00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:35,420
<i> Monsieur, monsieur. </ I> Please, please.

00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:39,487
This is the masterful young Lieutenant Stirling.

00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,900
Bonjourn mon ami, bonjourn.

00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:45,392
Oh, Ms. Gelder? 

00:21:46,902 --> 00:21:48,392
Uh, comment allez vous?

00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,174
Oh, tres bien, merci, Eh, I see you studies <i> français. </ I>

00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:54,769
That is very nice.

00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:57,576
279
<I> Oui. </ I> But when I say it, it does not sound like you do.

00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:01,449
Well, this is the same for me that only,<i> English,</ I> you see? 

00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,454
And at the trading post I do not learned,

00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:06,184
but there's only papa.. and he's worse even than me. 

00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:08,419
Tell me, <i> monsieur ... </ i>

00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:11,360
if your army should have a message from papa...

00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,227
They will tell me, no?

00:22:13,298 --> 00:22:16,756
Well, you see, but you mustn't worry. 

00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:20,236
Maybe I can, well, look into, and let you know.

00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:24,332  
Oh, ceci tres gentil. So very kind of you to trouble

00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:26,707
I would be most grateful..

00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:29,406
..until then.. <I> Au revoir, monsieur. </ I>

00:22:48,937 --> 00:22:54,064 
Ahh, bonjourn monsieur le sergent.
Good morning, sir.

00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:57,297
Morning.

00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,594
"Come at once, Francis."

00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:38,305 
Oh, sergent, do I for a ride?

00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:40,681
All right, yes sir.

00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:37,298
Francis, it's me, the second Lieutenant.

00:24:47,856 --> 00:24:50,188
Hey, hey Francis?

00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:53,188
Remember me?

00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,154
Sure, maybe I am more crazy.  

00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:02,666
Most Second Lieutenants are.

00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:12,376
All right, all right!

00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:15,140
Then, then you can talk?

00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:17,613
I, I did hear you the first time.

00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:21,778
I didn't imagine this all. I'm not crazy.

00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,616
That's debatable, Lieutenant.

00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:26,490
But, well, then why did you send for me?

00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:29,026
Me? Send for you?

00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:30,789
Yes, this note you wrote me?

00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:34,764
- I never put anything in writing..
- But it's signed "Francis"?

00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:37,802
Get smart, Lieutenant, you've been rimmed by your buddies.

00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,393
Rimmed?

00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:42,631
Uh, then the joke's on them,  you can talk.

00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:44,902
I'm going to bring them out here and prove it.

00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:47,604
Lieutenant, meet the Sphinx.

00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:56,445
You mean, you let a laugh at me?

00:25:56,521 --> 00:25:58,819
Let them think I'm a mental case?

00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,757
Nice that you know that you send me home as a psycho.

00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:03,623
- So?
- Well, I know what you think ...

00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:06,926
a Second Lieutenant,  but even we want to help win the war.

00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:10,729
Come back here. You're my rouse ragain.

00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:14,670
I never thought I'd have that whet nurse a Lieutenant but...

00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,764
How'd you like to be a hero?

00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:18,570
Me? A hero?

00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:21,578
For your information there's a Jap observation post ...

00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:25,173
spot in your base about 2000 yards from headquarters.

00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,309
Oh, don't be an ass.

00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:31,754
Be that as it may, that Jap observation post is there.

00:26:31,823 --> 00:26:34,690
Well, then why aren't you doing something about it?

00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:38,752
- I am, I'm telling you.
- Me? Why?

00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,764
You know what section you're in?

00:26:40,832 --> 00:26:43,801
Well, certainly, I'm in G-2, intelligence.

00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:47,827
Than, don't sound so all fired surprised when I give you some.

00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:50,334
This must be reported immediately.

00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:53,468
Now look! Haven't you been in the army ...

00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:57,106
..long enough the knowing that you don't get medals for just reporting?

00:26:57,182 --> 00:27:00,515
- But what else can I do? 
- What else can you do?

00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:04,214
- You can go out and capture that post.
- Who? Me?

00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:07,986
Either you're a soldier or an optical illusion? 

00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:11,324
And that night I have to find out which?

00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:24,974
Ohh, that's must be an illusion.

00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:28,035
What do you made up for, Lieutenant?

00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:40,552
My acking back.

00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:47,898
Shows of my great aunt Regret tail..

00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:51,902
You're making enough noise to wake up the all Jap army.

00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:04,709
Well, well. What are you made up for Lieutenant?

00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:08,549
What secret weapon have you got hidden in that pack, huh?

00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:12,014
It's a shelter hat.

00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:16,390
In case it rains or do you expect to shack up with the all Japs? 

00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:18,929
Come On.. Get rid of it. Come On!

00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:28,134
- Why the shovel?
- We may have to dig entrenchments.

00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:32,540
Look, Lieutenant! If there's need to be digging down, then would be to bury you.

00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,544
Get rid of it.

00:28:37,982 --> 00:28:40,780
And that gas mask too.

00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:43,719
I have an order to wear my gas mask at all times.

00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:47,781
Do you really believe that two Japs in the middle of the jungle ...

00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:50,953
Are gonna launch the first gas attack to the war ...

00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:52,758
against you, personally?

00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:54,765
That go all too.

00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:04,566
Now, how many grenades, you got there, uh?

00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:08,570
- A dozen.
- A dozen?

00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:11,638 
Look, Lieutenant. We're going after two.

00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:14,617
Get it? Two frightened Japs. 

00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:17,820
How do you know that are frightened?

00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:20,449
Two Japs solo on are always frightened.

00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:22,993
One grenade planned it.

00:29:24,195 --> 00:29:26,823
A whole dozen grenades.

00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:37,505 
- Now, that revolver..
- Oh, suppose the tommy gun doesn't work?

00:29:37,575 --> 00:29:41,477
Then, you won't need anything except flowers.

00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:43,036
Yeah. Huhu...

00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:52,119
- Francis, you stripped me.
- Ahhah, we're all ready to go.

00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,658
And for the love of Burma men, quiet!

00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:56,216
Come on.

00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:22,618
Hey, go yen. I am sensitive.

00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:24,880
Come on.

00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:34,129
I thought you said it was only 2000 yards.

00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:36,861
Oh, we haven't even gone 200 yet.

00:30:51,449 --> 00:30:52,916 
Shhhh, they're right up there.

00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:56,945
What do we do now?

00:30:57,922 --> 00:30:59,617
I'm gonna get behind them.

00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:02,251
You stay here. When I yell ...

00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:05,353
- Fire a couple shots to the air.
- In the air?

00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:08,358
Shh, shhh, shhh, quiet.

00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:10,367
In the air.

00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:16,066
Pull down your guns

00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,074
You're surraunded! 

00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:24,811
Come down! On a double!

00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:32,318
Holding with your men, Lieutenant!

00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:34,814
I'm I'm coming!

00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,886
Forward, men.

00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,007
I'm Lieutenant Sakia. Please to make your acquaintance.

00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:55,375
Save me a bows . One false move will brilliant.

00:31:55,446 --> 00:31:58,176
Very good, very good. We surrender.

00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,410
I hope you kiss a duck, you surrender.

00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:03,420
Keep those hands higher, high!

00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:07,347
- Come aroud here, Lieutenant!
- Yes sir.

00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:11,990
Get them up.

00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:15,829
Not need to worry my good fellow.. We know when the game is up.

00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:19,893
Eheh.. Quite a call of it in accent, you got there.

00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:24,271
- Harvard, I presume.
- Harvard? Certainly not.

00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:28,301
- Yale.
- Ohh, "socially". Let's go.

00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:32,906
What happened?

00:32:35,386 --> 00:32:36,910
"What happened?"

00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:41,748
Well, my boy, you've army congratulated.

00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:44,454
- G-2 is proud of you.
- No, no thank you, sir.

00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:46,019
Yes sir.

00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:51,732
Yeah..

00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:54,795
- How about one of these?
- No, no. Thank you, sir.

00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:59,434
I suppose you realize, Sterling, what you've done all of highly irregular, mind you, but of tremendous value.

00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:02,411
And you did it alone. That's give remarkable part of it.

00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,812
Oh, no sir. That's not quite...

00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:08,083
- What's up Lieutenant?
- I mean yes, sir.

00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:10,313
The General is dilighted.

00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:12,856
And now, Lieutenant just.. a few questions.

00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:16,155
- Yes sir.
- The Japanese observation post..

00:33:16,227 --> 00:33:18,627
just how did you find out about it?

00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:22,823
What's the matter? It's a simple question.

00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:26,432
- Yes sir.
- Well?

00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:30,099
Well, I don't know, sir.

00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:34,440
- What kind of an answer is that?
- I mean, I'd rather not say, sir.

00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:37,174
You're rather not say. You Capture a Jap observation post ...

00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:39,682
Within 2000 yards of headquarters and you'd rather not say.

00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:43,016
- Why?
- Well, even if I told you, sir, you would't believe me.

00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:45,351
Well I'll be the judge of that, Well?

00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:48,756
- Do you really wanna know?
- I demand to know.

00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:53,221
Well, sir, it all happened like this.

00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:55,231
The mule ...

00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:10,472
Well, Lieutenant, welcome home.

00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,916
It's, it's... that mule again?

00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:23,890
Such a fascinating fun that we have. Such fascinating.

00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,038
Is Colonel Plepper.

00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:37,603
- Good morning, Colonel Plepper.
- Good Morning.

00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:39,643
No. No, my boy.

00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:43,805
- Well, well. Then how are we today?
- Fine, sir.

00:34:43,881 --> 00:34:46,509
Of course. we are nothing serious the matter with us.

00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:48,518
Nothing at all.

00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:52,518
But you do have a cool feeling at these your fingers?

00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,285
No sir.

00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:58,624
- Then you suffer from a little dizziness, everything seems to be revolving?
- No sir.

00:34:58,696 --> 00:35:02,598
I mean there are times when you feel faint, out of breath?

00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:05,665
- No sir, I don't think so sir..
- No.

00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:11,368
Oh, I understand, Stirling.

00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:13,433
The thing that's bothering you is here, Uhm, uhm

00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:16,639
You're feeling perfectly all right, then suddenly ...

00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:18,773
There's a sharp violent pain?

00:35:22,353 --> 00:35:23,911
No.

00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:29,016
- Lieutenant did they take X.rays of your head?
- Yes sir.

00:35:29,093 --> 00:35:31,561
- And what did they show?
- I've nothing, sir.

00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:50,510
Lieutenant, what the devil of the matter with you?

00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:52,276
There's nothing about with me, sir.

00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:56,218
Nothing? Uh!, I've an attitude for a military man.

00:35:57,088 --> 00:36:01,286
Drive my doctors crazy, drive my psychiatrists crazy, drive my entire staff crazy.

00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:02,986
- I'm sorry sir.
- Sorry?, uh!

00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:06,689
Half of them say you're loco, the other half says you won't.

00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:09,631
Me and here docs right think they are loco.

00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:13,431
- People mad have a good dose of castor oil and hot bath, if there is crazy resistant ...

00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,870
- Doesn't make much difference anyway..
- Yes sir.

00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:19,740
- How did you ever get your commission Lieutenant?
- In Officer's candidate school, sir.

00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:21,778
- absolved your examinations?
- Yes sir.

00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,541
Doesn't prove a thing.

00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:26,014
459
- Father and mother are living?  
- Yes sir.

00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:27,880
- Sane?
- Yes sir.

00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:30,011
Doesn't prove a thing.

00:36:30,087 --> 00:36:32,749
Well that's it, gentlemen. What do you think?

00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:36,692
A clear cut case of hyper imaginative reaction ...

00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:38,729
induced by emotional starvation.

00:36:38,796 --> 00:36:40,559
Acute symptoms impelled by battle fatigue.

00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:43,896
- What treatment would you suggest, colonel?
- Activity.

00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:45,492
Violent activity.

00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:48,061
Give him 4 aspirins and send him back to duty.

00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:51,864
Sterling, the medics have recommended activity.

00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:54,969
- For you fortunately I've got just a thing.
- Really, sir?

00:36:55,046 --> 00:37:00,450
- Yes. Do you see this area, Lieutenant?
- Yes sir.

00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:03,919
We have reason to believe that there is a Jap patrol in there.

00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:05,916
- That colose?
- Right.

00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:08,220
We don't know the number of men  or just where they are.

00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:10,817
So, we decided to send out a patrol tomorrow.

00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:11,953
Of course, sir.

00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:14,623
- And I've chosen you to lead it.
- Yes sir.

00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:17,293
- Who? Me? But ...
- But what?

00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:19,928
But ... Yes, sir.

00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:22,634
"Secret"

00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:25,574
"Hill X246" "Camp"

00:37:30,514 --> 00:37:32,004
Yes?

00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:34,918
Who is this?

00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:39,545
- Francis who?
<I>Lieutenant, please </ i>.

00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:43,324
But if you can't talk on the telephone?

00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:46,227
<I> I'm hearing you're leading </ i> <i>an expedition. </ I>

00:37:46,297 --> 00:37:49,425
you know what? That's impossible.

00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:53,095
<I> For you to lead an expedition </ i> <i>or for me to hear about it? </ I>

00:37:54,538 --> 00:37:58,269
- You're just guessing. <I>
- "Is Hill X246" guessing? </ i>

00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:02,811
For heaven sake's, that's top secret.

00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,872
<I> Now you're showing signs </ i> <i>of basic intelligence. </ I>

00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,544
<I> Then you'll show a little more </ i> <i>and get over here. </ I>

00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,780
Yes sir.., I mean, I'll be there.

00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,635
How did you know I was lead a patrol?

00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:35,475
How did you find it about Hill X246?

00:38:35,546 --> 00:38:38,947
If I found out it could be sure the Japs know.

00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:41,211
- But that's terrible.
- Why?

00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:44,345
Oh, they'll ambush us, well, I have to call off the patrol.

00:38:44,422 --> 00:38:47,687
Ohh, nothing of the sort that's the beauty of it.

00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:51,717
We know, they know, now all we gotta do is the out manoeuvre on.

00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:53,058
Who is "we"?

00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:56,327
Well let's just say that we're going to work it out to get there.

00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,268
- For why'd out?
- The information that the Japs have ...

00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:03,136
It gives you a great opportunity.

00:39:03,207 --> 00:39:04,265 
- For what?

00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:07,038
To carry out your mission successfully.

00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:09,238
But what have I do?

00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:12,749
I don't know why I worry about you, Lieutenant.

00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:15,843
I can't even understand why I like you.

00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:20,220
I suppose and all these are traces of the mother complex.

00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:42,635
Lieutenant? This mule should be in the river, with the rest up.

00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:45,944
I want him on to the front.
I know, but that is the way it's done.

00:39:46,016 --> 00:39:48,450
Sergeant, shall am I in charge of this patrol?

00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:50,987
- Yeah, So they told me.
- What's sir?

00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,579
Sir.

00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:57,421
- Tell them to close up.
- They're close enough.

00:39:57,495 --> 00:40:00,020
- Sergeant Chillingbacker!
- Yes sir.

00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,539
Have a boy, Lieutenant.

00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:13,043
- What are we do now?
- Why you just go ahead with the patrol?

00:40:24,855 --> 00:40:27,517
This is it. X-246.

00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:35,127
Take the men down for our security post on the edge of the clearing. 
And tell them to keep alert.

00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:37,690
Those are supposed to be 20 yards out in the jungle.

00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:40,630
I want them on the edge of the clearing.

00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:42,968
And tell them to pitch the tents in the center.

00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:47,009
- You mean out there in the open?
- That's right.

00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,875
- But, Lieutenant ...
- There.

00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:52,107
Okay.

00:40:52,183 --> 00:40:54,743
- What's sir?
- Sir.

00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:16,204
- What now?

00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:19,868
Have them give the campfire ready, a big one. 

00:41:19,944 --> 00:41:22,708
What? I will not.

00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:25,715
Are we gonna handle this, Lieutenant?

00:41:27,451 --> 00:41:29,442
We are.

00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:56,075
What a way to fight a war.

00:42:03,888 --> 00:42:06,914
What do we do now? Just wait to be white out?

00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:11,257
- Now ... we light the fire.
- Light the fire?

00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,218
Splendid. Fine job.

00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:12,421
And now, Lieutenant, just how did you know ...

00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:14,423
that the Japs were going to ambush you?

00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,088
Yes? 

00:43:22,967 --> 00:43:26,596
Good morning, Lieutenant. We have a visitor.

00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:31,107
- Ohh no.. No another doctor.
- Not this time.

00:43:31,175 --> 00:43:34,110
Colonel Plepper says you need stimulation.

00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:36,703
Stimulation. Bless that dude

00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,248
Yes, but who... who is it?

00:43:39,316 --> 00:43:41,250
- Are we respectable?
- Yes.

00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:42,808 
Yes.

00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:48,291
You may come in.

00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:59,766
No, no, no. Please do not get up.

00:43:59,837 --> 00:44:02,032
And how is my Lieutenant?

00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:06,804
Well, fine since you came.

00:44:06,877 --> 00:44:08,811
Then I'm happy to be here.

00:44:08,879 --> 00:44:13,976
- Will you be all right, Lieutenant?
- Oh.. I'll take very good care of him.

00:44:14,051 --> 00:44:15,985
I'll be outside.

00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,256
Just in case.

00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:28,188
- Please let me.
- Thank you.

00:44:32,469 --> 00:44:34,562
I thought this would pleased you.

00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:36,433
Gee.

00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:39,237
Thanks. And then thanks for coming.

00:44:39,309 --> 00:44:41,436
Oh, Thank you.
 
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:43,412
Me? What for?

00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:48,816
What for? Why everyone know hell courses, we talk of nothing else.

00:44:48,886 --> 00:44:53,949
Killing all those ... And not one of your men even wounded.

00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:56,618
It was so very wonderful.

00:44:56,694 --> 00:45:00,721
- Yes, but wasn't I ...
- Please don't be so modest.

00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:04,427
Gee. You're so beautiful, Maureen.

00:45:07,905 --> 00:45:10,100
I'm sorry. Forgive me.

00:45:10,174 --> 00:45:13,041
Forgive you? For what?

00:45:14,011 --> 00:45:16,445
Oh, oh Please.

00:45:16,513 --> 00:45:19,038
I like to hear you say Maureen.

00:45:20,284 --> 00:45:23,651
Gee. My name is Peter.

00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:25,882
Peter.

00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:31,753
What is that?

00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:37,932
- I don't know.
- Have you ever seen it before?

00:45:38,001 --> 00:45:41,459
No, not that I ... Say it look someone's like...

00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:44,439
Could it be that someone is trying to send a message to you?

00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:48,535
Who would want to reach me? Gosh, I can't read these signals. 

00:45:48,612 --> 00:45:50,705
At Papa traiding post we had a wireless.

00:45:50,781 --> 00:45:52,715
- Can you read that?
- I would try.

00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:57,710
BUT ...

00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:04,319
QUICK.

00:46:05,162 --> 00:46:06,823
- "But quick". Yes?
- F ...

00:46:06,897 --> 00:46:10,094
RAN ...

00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:13,534
ClS.

00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,868
- What does it mean?
- "But quick Francis.". 

00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:17,770 
Then must be in trouble. I get to get out of here.

00:46:20,477 --> 00:46:23,446
- Going somewhere, Lieutenant?
- No, no.

00:46:30,988 --> 00:46:33,684
There are guards out there. What might I gotta do now?

00:46:33,757 --> 00:46:36,988
- You wish to get outside?
- I must gotta see Francis.

00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:40,996
Oh.. That is very simple. I will go out.

00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,938
In two minutes, they will not be there.

00:46:56,613 --> 00:46:58,604
Francis, Francis, where are you?

00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:06,352
Francis, you're hurt.

00:47:06,423 --> 00:47:08,983
I got you fast as I could. Tell me what happened.

00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:12,324
Nothing. Don't you ever get tired?

00:47:12,396 --> 00:47:14,557
I just wanted to tell you ...

00:47:15,899 --> 00:47:17,196
Ah, ah.. You've brought company.

00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:26,139 
- Why don't you wait for me?
- But, well,  I didn't think there wasn't time.

00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:28,371
Now, what were you saying, Francis?

00:47:28,445 --> 00:47:30,845
- Who are you talking to, Peter?
- Francis.

00:47:30,914 --> 00:47:35,010
- Why did you send for me?
- Lieutenant.

00:47:35,085 --> 00:47:37,110
It was you to sent signals, wasn't it?

00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,789
Well? say something.

00:47:40,457 --> 00:47:43,893
What's the matter with you?
Don't you realize that I had to escape from a psycho ward to get here?

00:47:43,961 --> 00:47:45,451
I could be call martial for this.

00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:49,863
Oh, my lieutenant. Do not excite yourself like this.

00:47:49,933 --> 00:47:53,892
- Come, let us go back.
- No. he can't do this to me.

00:47:53,971 --> 00:47:56,599
Now why did you send for me? Come on, now start talking.

00:47:56,673 --> 00:47:59,506
But <i> mon ami, </ i> come with Maureen.

00:47:59,576 --> 00:48:03,808
- This is not good for you.
- Then you think I'm crazy too.

00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:06,247
- But I tell you, Francis can talk.

00:48:06,316 --> 00:48:08,784
Oh yeah. Yes, of course.

00:48:08,852 --> 00:48:11,582
And then very intelligent mulas too.

00:48:11,655 --> 00:48:13,816
You must do have he's said.

00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:18,658
- But he hasn't said anything.
- You have too excited to hear him.

00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:22,358
He said, it was all a big mistake.

00:48:22,432 --> 00:48:25,595
And you must go back with Maureen and rest.

00:48:26,503 --> 00:48:30,030
The nurse she will be so angry with both of us.

00:48:30,107 --> 00:48:32,575
Let us start walking.

00:48:32,643 --> 00:48:35,578
Now see what you've done. Why don't you talk?

00:48:35,646 --> 00:48:38,513
Please, please, Lieutenant, come let us go.

00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:40,880
You got me into this you. You! You!

00:48:40,951 --> 00:48:45,615
Oh. Peter, I know. You wait right here.

00:48:45,689 --> 00:48:48,715
I'm in right back. Wait like a good boy.

00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:51,920
Just one moment. Wait. Uh?

00:48:56,066 --> 00:48:57,931
Quite a dame.

00:48:58,001 --> 00:49:00,333
Oh, now that ruined everything for me, you talk, uh?

00:49:00,404 --> 00:49:02,668
Well I have you know Ms. Gelder is no dame.

00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:06,766
That's a matter of view point. Now maybe we can talk.

00:49:06,843 --> 00:49:10,040
Francis, stop treating me like a child. Remember, I'm an officer.

00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:13,514
Remember? Lieutenant, didn't owns me.

00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:17,041
- Oh I now, why did you send for me?
- Cause I've got so highly information.

00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,645
Oh no. Oh no. Not again.

00:49:19,723 --> 00:49:23,523
- Look. Look At Me. You see this?
- Mmm. A pajamas.

00:49:23,593 --> 00:49:25,060
- JUS I presume?

00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:27,062
Yeah, from the psycho ward where you put me.

00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:31,529
Uh, uhu... 
Still, it's in credit to be have, and I thought you might just this well ...

00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:34,126
Would you please stop trying to bill me up?

00:49:34,204 --> 00:49:36,832
A few months ago, I was a perfectly happy second lieutenant ...

00:49:36,907 --> 00:49:39,501
Mind in my all business... bothering nobody.

00:49:39,576 --> 00:49:41,737
Then I met you and what happens?

00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:44,144
I spend half of my time in the booby hatch.

00:49:44,214 --> 00:49:48,014
Well, thanks very, thanks, but I've had enough. 
Maybe now, I get stay out of the hospital.

00:49:48,085 --> 00:49:50,280
Okay. If you're don't minding yourself ...

00:49:50,354 --> 00:49:53,983
...bombing in the camp this afternoon, I don't know why'd you worry.

00:49:54,057 --> 00:49:55,183
Are you crazy?

00:49:55,258 --> 00:49:59,217
Hey.. you're the one in the psycho ward, remember?

00:50:02,265 --> 00:50:04,597
N.. Now.. Wait a minute, Francis.

00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:07,967
- What do you mean "bombing in the camp"?
- Uh..That's better.

00:50:08,038 --> 00:50:11,098
I've got so highly information, and better be pass on fast.

00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:16,168
At 4:35 this afternoon, headquarters gets hit. Three waves of enemy bombers.

00:50:17,047 --> 00:50:19,447
An array? But this is serious.

00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:22,349
I hope to kiss my great aunt Regret it is serious.

00:50:22,419 --> 00:50:26,082
Remember: 4:35 three waves of enemy bombers.

00:50:26,156 --> 00:50:28,454
Uhh, looks like the dame came for help.

00:50:30,827 --> 00:50:34,456
Oh.. What will I do now? They take me back to the psycho ward now, I won't be able the..

00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:37,898 
Cause then there's an old army maneuver known as "squamen".

00:50:37,968 --> 00:50:41,028
Quick, behind those bushes over there. Hurry.

00:50:47,644 --> 00:50:50,511
If you are not right about that the array, I'll be klept raid out the army.

00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:53,447
Might be a patriotic gesture. Duck!

00:50:59,156 --> 00:51:01,716
- You sure that is the place Ms.? 
- <I>Oui </ i> I'm sure..

00:51:01,792 --> 00:51:05,319
This is the mule. But the poor lieutenant is gone.

00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:08,364
Never should I've left not for a moment.

00:51:08,432 --> 00:51:12,425
- So that's talking mule, eh?
- Why don't we ask him where his pal is.

00:51:12,502 --> 00:51:14,766
Do not waste time with this stupid thing...

00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:18,035
while the poor Lieutenant is getting lost somewhere in the jungle.

00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:20,406
Oh, he's probably halfway back the camp, right now.

00:51:20,477 --> 00:51:22,570
Come then. We must sure.

00:51:22,646 --> 00:51:25,114
Ohh, my poor lieutenant.

00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,655
Remember enemie Bombers at 4:35.

00:51:33,723 --> 00:51:36,658 
Ohh.. my poor lieutenant.

00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:46,360
Lieutenant do you realize the seriousness of this information?

00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:48,404
Yes sir.

00:51:51,174 --> 00:51:54,507
Where's you'd get it? If you tell me was that, that jackass again, I ...

00:51:54,578 --> 00:51:56,978

- For you, sir.

00:52:04,154 --> 00:52:06,679

00:52:06,756 --> 00:52:09,987
- Lieutenant, one of us is crazy.
- Yes sir.
- Yeah..

00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:12,688
- Do not be impertinent, young man.
- Oh no sir.

00:52:12,762 --> 00:52:15,822
- All right. Lieutenant.
- I got to take the chance on your task, than I'm gonna trust you. 

00:52:15,899 --> 00:52:18,197 
- I can afford not to, that's all.

00:52:19,336 --> 00:52:20,826
Lieutenant. 

00:52:21,738 --> 00:52:24,229
Do you know the status of a buck privates and men's are a mean?

00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:27,606
well, if the information you gave me isn't right, heaven help you.

00:52:27,677 --> 00:52:30,202
I could I have you busted so low ...

00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:33,579
.. that you'll have to use a telescope to look up to a buck private.

00:52:34,351 --> 00:52:35,841
Yes sir.

00:52:55,572 --> 00:52:58,132
Engineers basis. Delaminate. Red alert.

00:53:09,953 --> 00:53:11,921
May heaven help you, Lieutenant.

00:53:31,841 --> 00:53:33,934
Sergeant, get those boxes and leave.

00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:46,250
Lieutenant, the only thing I can say is ...

00:53:46,323 --> 00:53:48,587
heaven help you.

00:53:48,658 --> 00:53:51,559
Do not complain. This is for the duration of the war plus six months.

00:53:51,628 --> 00:53:53,687
Quick. There is heat, are the Japs.

00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:47,583
For heaven's sake, Francis, you're not sleeping?

00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:58,284
It's after 4:35. It's after 4:35.

00:54:58,361 --> 00:55:01,524
Ehh.. usually it is bad this time of day.

00:55:01,598 --> 00:55:03,589
But nothing's happened.

00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:06,898
I hope headquarters didn't go to sleep on that information.

00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:09,871
- Go to sleep.. We brought and find warplanes from every units in Burma.

00:55:13,109 --> 00:55:15,703 
Francis, Francis, are you... are sure of your information?

00:55:15,779 --> 00:55:20,011
- Ohhh.. I suspect it's all right.
- Suspect? Suspect? 

00:55:20,083 --> 00:55:22,017
Do you know what are gonna do to me?

00:55:22,085 --> 00:55:25,054
I' gonna have to use a telescope to look up a buck private.

00:55:25,121 --> 00:55:27,589
Oh why had I even listening you.

00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:30,023
My career is ruined.

00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:35,461
Did a mean. Do second Lieutenants have careers?

00:55:44,307 --> 00:55:46,207
Wait a minute.

00:55:46,276 --> 00:55:49,939
- I think I hear something.
- And they're mosquitoes.

00:55:58,254 --> 00:56:00,620
Francis, they're coming. Look. Up there.

00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:02,920
I can see them. Look.

00:56:12,736 --> 00:56:15,170
And here come our interceptors.

00:56:22,345 --> 00:56:24,245
I knew you're right all the time, pal.

00:56:24,314 --> 00:56:26,407
I'm so happy, I could kiss you.

00:56:26,483 --> 00:56:30,010
Relax, Lieutenant. I can take it as well as an ex mule ...

00:56:30,086 --> 00:56:32,145
but this has a limit to everything.

00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:38,861
- Lieutenant?
- No. Thank you, sir.

00:56:38,928 --> 00:56:44,628
And as I said Lieutenant, this entire command will be eternally in your debt.
 Eternally.

00:56:44,701 --> 00:56:46,794
Now come, come. No more nonsense.

00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:50,465
You must realize, that this is going the army joking stage.
- But, Sir..

00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:53,907
You know, Lieutenant, I'm with you very fond of you.

00:56:53,977 --> 00:56:55,342
Yes sir?

00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:57,972
- And, I'm on act as your father.
- Yes sir.

00:56:58,047 --> 00:57:03,679
And.. Isn't an <i>affaire d'amour, </ i>hey, Lieutenant?

00:57:04,387 --> 00:57:05,752
I could understand.

00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:09,752
<I> D'amour? </ I>Oh, oh. No, sir. There wasn't any  girl.

00:57:09,826 --> 00:57:11,760
Oh.. No girl.

00:57:12,629 --> 00:57:16,497
But what the Great God Jupiter, why that so long find confidential your source of information?

00:57:16,566 --> 00:57:17,931
I just can't tell you, sir.

00:57:18,001 --> 00:57:21,164
- Why?, Why?
- Because you won't believe me, if I did.

00:57:21,237 --> 00:57:23,569
Oh. No, no. No that mule again...

00:57:25,975 --> 00:57:27,465
Yes sir.

00:58:03,613 --> 00:58:07,913
Hello of you! Is that our cute home mule again?

00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:09,542
How fascinating. Simply fascinating. 

00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:12,315
Lieutenant Humpert, hasn't anyone come to see me?

00:58:12,388 --> 00:58:15,824
If, by anyone, you mean Miss. Gelder, yes ...

00:58:15,892 --> 00:58:19,794
But the Colonel Plepper's orders are "no stimulation".

00:58:19,863 --> 00:58:22,661
No one is permanent can visit you, ...Except 

00:58:22,732 --> 00:58:27,066
- Except? Except who?
- Except the Commanding General.

00:58:27,136 --> 00:58:29,263
Who did you say?

00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:31,739
Lt. Gen. Stevens.

00:58:31,808 --> 00:58:34,299
Nobody can stop him from seen you.

00:58:34,377 --> 00:58:37,471
The Commanding General wants to see me? Oh no.

00:58:37,547 --> 00:58:39,208
But it's nothing to be afraid of.

00:58:39,282 --> 00:58:41,273
He's just another man.

00:58:42,819 --> 00:58:44,787
General Stevens.

00:58:49,893 --> 00:58:52,589
At ease, Lieutenant.

00:58:52,662 --> 00:58:54,823
- Sit down.
- Thank you sir.

00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:59,858
Well, you've been having quite a time. Haven't you son?

00:59:00,603 --> 00:59:01,865
Yes sir.

00:59:01,938 --> 00:59:05,237
You prop on very service both to your country and to my command.

00:59:06,009 --> 00:59:07,670
And you've also caused truly turmoil.

00:59:07,744 --> 00:59:09,735
You know that, don't you?

00:59:09,812 --> 00:59:11,871
I'm afraid I have, sir, but I didn't mean to.

00:59:11,948 --> 00:59:14,212
But, I'm sure that you did.

00:59:14,284 --> 00:59:18,084
And I think you and I can get to the crocks of these situations successfully.

00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:23,189
Now, in every interview, you're claim an army mule talks to you.

00:59:23,259 --> 00:59:25,489
- Is that right?
- Yes sir.

00:59:27,096 --> 00:59:29,894
My boy, I want you to understand the position ...

00:59:29,966 --> 00:59:31,957
In which you plays ball me and my command.

00:59:32,702 --> 00:59:35,899
Now, your actions are worth of the highest commendation.

00:59:35,972 --> 00:59:38,566
But your explanation of those actions is an affront ...

00:59:38,641 --> 00:59:41,269
the intelligence to dignity of my command.

00:59:42,545 --> 00:59:45,139
How do you suppose this tale of the talking mule ...

00:59:45,214 --> 00:59:47,705
will sounds when communicate in Washington?

00:59:47,784 --> 00:59:49,081
But it's true, sir.

00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:53,818
Am I do understand you refuse to tell the real truth, Lieutenant?

00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:57,724
Oh no. Sir.. 
I have told the real truth. It's just that nobody believe me.

00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:01,428
Hell I'm stamped. Completely stamped.

01:00:01,497 --> 01:00:04,261
You really believe a mule talked to you, don't you?

01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:05,596
I know it, sir.

01:00:06,669 --> 01:00:10,036
Positively, the wierdest tale I ever heard.

01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:12,836
West Point, 35 years in the army ...

01:00:12,909 --> 01:00:16,538
nine campaigns, seven children, four of 'em in the army.

01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:18,672
I thought I'd seen everything.

01:00:18,748 --> 01:00:22,081
But a Lieutenant who insists he know the mule can talk.

01:00:22,151 --> 01:00:25,746
May.. May I make a suggestion, sir?

01:00:25,822 --> 01:00:28,290
May? Ohh.. I insist that you do.

01:00:28,358 --> 01:00:32,124
Well Perhaps.. Perhaps you're going have a talk with Francis.

01:00:32,195 --> 01:00:34,493
Perhaps I what?

01:00:34,564 --> 01:00:37,397
You mean you want me to meet this animal?

01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:41,597
Yes, sir. Then you can ask if what I said isn't that true, sir.

01:00:41,671 --> 01:00:44,435
Me? Ask a mule?

01:00:44,507 --> 01:00:48,204
Well. If I have did such a thing, I lose my command.

01:00:49,078 --> 01:00:52,070
Talk to a mule?

01:00:52,148 --> 01:00:54,082
But I should say not.

01:00:58,921 --> 01:01:02,618
Lieutenant, this is the animal?

01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:07,395
Yes sir. Hello, Francis.

01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:12,333
How are you today?

01:01:18,408 --> 01:01:22,276
Francis, I want you to meet the Commanding General.

01:01:24,414 --> 01:01:26,405
Francis, the commanding general.

01:01:28,217 --> 01:01:30,151
Is something that matter?

01:01:41,998 --> 01:01:44,933
Sir, I'm afraid I should have told you this before.

01:01:45,001 --> 01:01:47,936
Francis is scared that the army will discover he can talk.

01:01:48,004 --> 01:01:49,232
What?

01:01:49,305 --> 01:01:52,240
He said he was afraid that he sent to the Officer Candidet School.

01:01:54,777 --> 01:01:57,507
- The mule?
- But that what he said, sir.

01:01:58,581 --> 01:02:00,845
- Well, what are we do?
- Well, sir ...

01:02:00,917 --> 01:02:03,283
Francis has been in the army for seven years...

01:02:03,352 --> 01:02:05,513
and he takes great pride in the military.

01:02:05,588 --> 01:02:08,557
I believe if you're giving him orders, he'd obey them.

01:02:08,624 --> 01:02:10,785
Orders? What sort of orders?

01:02:12,495 --> 01:02:15,953
Well, perhaps maybe.. maybe you could trick in the talking, sir.

01:02:16,032 --> 01:02:19,991 
Lieutenant. As an officer, have you required to do some mighty strange things ...

01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:22,128
But giving orders to a mule to trichk her..him..it..

01:02:22,839 --> 01:02:27,742
..it.. in the talking.

01:02:27,810 --> 01:02:30,506
Well, I just wonder what the limit is.

01:02:41,991 --> 01:02:42,923
Attention!

01:02:45,995 --> 01:02:47,519
Right hand!

01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:54,566
Left hand!

01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:59,938
About, FACE!

01:03:06,215 --> 01:03:08,206 
March Hand!

01:03:10,853 --> 01:03:12,252
At ease.

01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:18,584
Attention! 

01:03:20,329 --> 01:03:21,796
Renumber!

01:03:25,868 --> 01:03:29,463
Want you try it again, sir?

01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:34,336
A step forward. March.

01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:38,579 
Report!

01:03:43,686 --> 01:03:44,618
At ease.

01:03:47,890 --> 01:03:50,882
A remarkable well trained mule, Lieutenant.

01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:54,054
But there is no indication that the animal can talk.

01:03:56,299 --> 01:03:58,494
May I try again, sir?

01:03:58,568 --> 01:04:00,559
Go ahead.

01:04:02,939 --> 01:04:06,932
Francis, you and I have came through a lot together.

01:04:08,244 --> 01:04:10,235
We faced death together.

01:04:10,913 --> 01:04:14,440
So for my sake. Would you, please ...

01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:16,781
please talk to the General?

01:04:24,594 --> 01:04:28,052 
This all thing is ridiculous, Lieutenant. It is inexcusable.

01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:30,189
Some of you junior officers are the army.

01:04:30,266 --> 01:04:33,133
You're full up, of broon and broon juice.

01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:35,136
You confuse me, you confuse the G-I

01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:37,138
You confuse the all war up.

01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:39,697
When I think at what you'll use the postwar world ...

01:04:39,775 --> 01:04:42,369
The hell that I have left stand to the danger.

01:04:42,445 --> 01:04:44,879
General, you said a mouth for.

01:04:44,947 --> 01:04:48,041
Just give me some junior officers and then I have the best...

01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:55,353
Who said that?

01:04:55,424 --> 01:04:58,621
It does my heart good, General to hear you talk that way...

01:04:58,694 --> 01:05:02,391
Just echo what I've been thinking ever since Pearl Harbor.

01:05:02,465 --> 01:05:05,662
Lieutenant, you're a ventriloquist.

01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:07,225
Oh No sir.

01:05:11,474 --> 01:05:12,406
Attention!

01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:17,178
No nonsense, this is an order.

01:05:17,246 --> 01:05:19,305
I want to right answers to direct questions.

01:05:20,249 --> 01:05:22,649
- Name?
- Francis.

01:05:23,486 --> 01:05:26,944
- Organization?
- 123 Mulas detachment, sir. 

01:05:27,023 --> 01:05:30,356
- Serial number?
- M-5-2-5-1-9.

01:05:30,426 --> 01:05:32,087
- At ease.

01:05:43,706 --> 01:05:46,197
That I'll be hand.

01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:48,368
I'll be bouble and triple hand.

01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:50,605
I'll be hand in 72 languages.

01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:53,774
- So you can talk?
- Yes sir.

01:05:59,822 --> 01:06:02,256 
Lieutenant Stirling, I owe you an apology.

01:06:03,159 --> 01:06:05,184
We all owe you an apology.

01:06:05,261 --> 01:06:06,751
Yes sir.

01:06:07,830 --> 01:06:11,197
You Francis have done a truly magnificent job for the army.

01:06:11,267 --> 01:06:16,170
Ohh.. shocks.. I would try to do my duty as I saw exel.

01:06:16,238 --> 01:06:20,004
When America hears about you little core more, feel a role in the war.

01:06:20,076 --> 01:06:22,010
That's the last thing I want, sir.

01:06:22,078 --> 01:06:23,909
And pardon the presumption, sir ...

01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,914
It's the last thing you should want to.

01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:29,076
- What you point?
- For my point here is the three-star general ...

01:06:29,151 --> 01:06:32,814
..won't get me further in those army psychiatrists than lieutenant here.

01:06:32,888 --> 01:06:35,049
Well, they would say different things when hear you talk.

01:06:35,124 --> 01:06:36,819
But they're not going to.

01:06:36,892 --> 01:06:40,726  
- What? You mean you won't talk?
- That's right, sir.

01:06:40,796 --> 01:06:44,527
- What if I order you to talk?
- I hope you won't, sir.

01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:46,329
But I'm the commanding general.

01:06:46,402 --> 01:06:50,805
And I'm a mule, sir, and I have the right to act like one.

01:06:52,975 --> 01:06:54,840
Francis, the one thing I won't tollerate ...

01:06:54,910 --> 01:06:57,140
in my command is willful insubordination.

01:06:57,213 --> 01:07:01,013
I'll obey any ordinary mule orders, sure. but that's all.

01:07:01,083 --> 01:07:04,519
You'll obey any orders you're qualified to obey, talkiong including.

01:07:04,587 --> 01:07:07,715
And if I don't? What happens to you?

01:07:09,592 --> 01:07:11,457
Are you threatening me?

01:07:11,527 --> 01:07:15,327
I mean to remind you, sir, what happened to the lieutenant.

01:07:15,398 --> 01:07:18,333
I'm perfectly aware what happened to the...

01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:22,193
Lieutenant, but I ...

01:07:22,271 --> 01:07:24,136
For the good of the service, I suggest ...

01:07:24,206 --> 01:07:26,436
..we forget about this little meeting.

01:07:26,509 --> 01:07:29,342
Well. If you going to be stubborn ehm ...

01:07:32,314 --> 01:07:34,305
Maybe I have a point on that.

01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:37,284
Anyway, for the second strategy, you leave me no alternatives.

01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:40,814
But how am I gonna get out of the psychopathic ward?

01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:43,552
Hell, that'll be take care of somehow.

01:07:44,794 --> 01:07:48,025
Then I think of it. And maybe you're right.

01:07:48,097 --> 01:07:50,031
This should go no further.

01:07:52,802 --> 01:07:56,568
- Very well, and are we all agreed?
- Yes sir.

01:07:58,507 --> 01:08:00,065
Well?

01:08:01,143 --> 01:08:03,077
Ohh, Yes sir.

01:08:08,284 --> 01:08:09,774
Yes?

01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:12,812
Surprise. Surprise, Lieutenant.

01:08:14,290 --> 01:08:17,316
Let's gonna start another ducky new basket.

01:08:17,393 --> 01:08:19,327
- Here you are. 
- Oh no yet. Don't.

01:08:19,395 --> 01:08:21,727
As the Colonel Plepper heard from General Stevens jet?

01:08:21,797 --> 01:08:25,096
Oh yes. In fact, he is with the General right now.

01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:30,231
Lieutenant, is it anything wrong with the General?

01:08:30,306 --> 01:08:32,638
Half of the medical staff is over there.

01:08:37,646 --> 01:08:41,343
Orders are orders, Colonel, and I order you to discharge Lieutenant Stirling.

01:08:41,417 --> 01:08:43,009
Sir, regulations are regulations.

01:08:43,085 --> 01:08:45,280
And I can't discharge a man in Sterling conditions.

01:08:45,354 --> 01:08:47,845
For the umpteenth time, Colonel, there's nothing wrong with Stirling.

01:08:47,923 --> 01:08:49,754
He is perfectly normal.

01:08:49,825 --> 01:08:54,057
Normal people normally don't go around truly in conversations with mules.

01:08:57,666 --> 01:09:00,191
Gentlemen, I was hoping I'd to avoid this ...

01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:04,598
but, for Lieutenant Stirlingt sake, you force me to...

01:09:07,109 --> 01:09:10,272
Colonel Carmichael, in according to the army regulations...

01:09:10,346 --> 01:09:13,008
You periodically giving me a thorough physically examination?

01:09:13,682 --> 01:09:14,774
Oh, yes sir.

01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:18,115
- You've always find my reflexes to be normal?
- Yes, General.

01:09:18,187 --> 01:09:21,156
You found no sign of neurosis, abnormality or mental elaboration?

01:09:21,223 --> 01:09:22,554
- No sir.
- Very good.

01:09:24,226 --> 01:09:27,024
Gentlemen, I have news for you.

01:09:27,096 --> 01:09:29,587
Lieutenant Stirling's mule can talk.

01:09:29,665 --> 01:09:32,395
I've talked with him, and once more, he's talked back.

01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:37,464
Really now, General.

01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:39,030
Steady, Plepper.

01:09:40,042 --> 01:09:43,273
- General..
- What is it?, Colonel Carmichael?

01:09:43,345 --> 01:09:45,677
Nothing, sir.

01:09:45,748 --> 01:09:48,683
I was mearly trying to remember when you had your last phisical.

01:09:48,751 --> 01:09:51,515
Get that through loco on of your eyes , Colonel.

01:09:51,587 --> 01:09:53,521
You're not getting me in any psycho ward.

01:09:53,589 --> 01:09:55,750
I tell you Francis can talk. Do you understand?

01:09:55,824 --> 01:09:57,917
- That mule can talk.
- Yes, General.

01:09:57,993 --> 01:10:00,154
If you say so, that mule can talk.

01:10:01,230 --> 01:10:03,095
That's better.

01:10:04,466 --> 01:10:07,867
Now, gentlemen, for obvious reasons ...

01:10:07,937 --> 01:10:10,371
Not a word of this should get out outside this office.

01:10:11,740 --> 01:10:13,867
Furthemore, I gave the mule my word.

01:10:15,945 --> 01:10:19,244 
Tell me, sir. Is it just Stirling's mule who talks to you..

01:10:19,315 --> 01:10:21,249
or do all mules talk?

01:10:23,385 --> 01:10:25,876
Excuse me, General. Put it right over there, Sergeant.

01:10:27,623 --> 01:10:29,682
Hooker, what the devil's the matter with you?

01:10:29,758 --> 01:10:33,057
It's just been a transcription of Tokyo broadcast. I think you should hear it, sir.

01:10:33,128 --> 01:10:36,222
Colonel Carmichael, when did you last examine Colonel Hooker?

01:10:36,298 --> 01:10:37,731
<I> This is Radio Tokyo ... </ i>

01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:40,394
<I>bringing you the voice </ i> <i>of your Tokio correspondent. </ I>

01:10:40,469 --> 01:10:42,903
<I> Good afternoon, fellows. </ I> <i>How's it going? </ I>

01:10:42,972 --> 01:10:44,667
<I>But before I give you the news of the day ... </ i>

01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:47,368
<I>I picked up a little top secrets </ i> <i>too good to keep. </ I>

01:10:47,443 --> 01:10:52,244
<I>Believe it or not, the Americans </ i> <i> have talking mule in the Burma command. </ I>

01:10:52,314 --> 01:10:56,876
<I>Nor mule talk, mind you, </ i> <i>but really important conversations. </ I>

01:10:56,952 --> 01:11:01,082 
<I> He report some Japanese movements, </ i> <i>and helps plans defense strategies. </ I>

01:11:01,156 --> 01:11:03,317
<I> At least </ i> <i>that with the General plans.</ I>

01:11:03,392 --> 01:11:06,884
<I>And three-star General </ i> <i>can't be wrong. </ I>

01:11:06,962 --> 01:11:08,725
<I> Can ya', fellows? </ I>

01:11:08,797 --> 01:11:11,061
<I>Well, that's the schedule bet, boys. </ I>

01:11:11,133 --> 01:11:14,569
<I>Of course, it's just barely possible </ i> <i>the poor man can be</ i>

01:11:15,571 --> 01:11:17,801
<I>Well, you'll guess as it good as mine</ I>

01:11:17,873 --> 01:11:22,173
<I> But it does make me wonder which jack-ass </ i> <i>would be the better General. </ I>

01:11:22,244 --> 01:11:25,441
C'est la guerre, <i> boys. </ I> <i>Not you're, that you, you are. </ I>

01:11:25,514 --> 01:11:27,379
Turn and blast that thing off.

01:11:27,449 --> 01:11:30,577
It is obvious the Japs got wins the Stirling's hallucination...

01:11:30,653 --> 01:11:33,087
and they'd reduce this in those damaging propaganda.

01:11:33,155 --> 01:11:35,180
- Brilliant deduction Colonel.
- I suggest, General ...

01:11:35,257 --> 01:11:37,782
We hence should immediate deny and state the real facts.

01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:40,260
But I'd like to know is how the news leaked out.

01:11:40,329 --> 01:11:43,093
I'm sure Francis didn't say anything.

01:11:43,165 --> 01:11:46,259
Hardly, let we share the lieutenant's delusions about the animal.

01:11:46,335 --> 01:11:48,895
Try the funny if have. Imagine if a mule really could talk.

01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:50,404
What do you mean "imagine"?

01:11:50,472 --> 01:11:52,872
The truth the Mule's idea isn't that to speak up these confidential....

01:11:54,043 --> 01:11:55,067
Yes.

01:11:56,412 --> 01:11:58,573
I beg your pardon, sir?

01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:02,379
A teletype, sir. Urgent.

01:12:12,027 --> 01:12:14,791
Well, we're due for a visit.

01:12:14,863 --> 01:12:16,990
Plane load of correspondents ...

01:12:17,066 --> 01:12:18,966
on their way, they come in heard the Tokyo broadcast.

01:12:19,034 --> 01:12:21,628
- They request permission to land.
- Of course, we're refuse this, sir.

01:12:21,704 --> 01:12:23,638
What? And make them think I'm really crazy?

01:12:23,706 --> 01:12:26,106
That mule is gonna have to talk to the press.

01:12:28,544 --> 01:12:30,842
Gentlemen, with your permission.

01:12:30,913 --> 01:12:34,974
Colonel Hooker, release Stirling and have him bring Francis here.

01:12:35,050 --> 01:12:37,484
Here, sir? Yes sir.

01:12:39,988 --> 01:12:42,479
- Colonel Hooker.
- Yes sir?

01:12:42,558 --> 01:12:45,755
Tell him do... brush him up a bit.

01:12:45,828 --> 01:12:47,318
Yes sir.

01:12:54,737 --> 01:12:56,932
And if you think of starting me on a basket...

01:12:57,005 --> 01:12:59,371
I have three of you a court martial.

01:12:59,441 --> 01:13:00,931
Dismissed.

01:13:21,029 --> 01:13:22,826
What's the idea, Lieutenant?

01:13:22,898 --> 01:13:24,923
The General's orders, sir.

01:13:45,354 --> 01:13:48,846
General, Lt. Stirling and a mule reporting, sir.

01:13:48,924 --> 01:13:50,915
Send them in.

01:14:01,503 --> 01:14:03,471
At ease.

01:14:03,539 --> 01:14:05,530
What catch you, Lieutenant?

01:14:05,607 --> 01:14:08,508
Oh, Francis still wouldn't come, sir 
He's here now under protest.

01:14:08,577 --> 01:14:10,738
- Oh, he is, eh?
- Yes sir.

01:14:10,813 --> 01:14:13,543
If you use him to double crossed. He's not gonna talk.

01:14:13,615 --> 01:14:16,083
- What?
- I'm sorry, Francis.

01:14:16,151 --> 01:14:19,120
An unfortunate development, but that's war.

01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:26,290
Francis, I want  you to meet Colonel Hooker. He's being a bit skeptical.

01:14:26,361 --> 01:14:29,194
The G-2 men, you know, hard to convince.

01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:40,231
Speak to.

01:14:47,249 --> 01:14:49,308
It's a pleasure, Francis.

01:14:49,384 --> 01:14:52,842
The General has spoken very highly of you.

01:14:55,557 --> 01:14:58,958
Now listen, Francis. This is no time for personal feelings.

01:14:59,027 --> 01:15:01,723
The morale of this entire command's at stake.

01:15:02,598 --> 01:15:04,532
Perhaps you should rest a while, General.

01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:08,195
- You looks very tired.
- Nonsense. He's just that stubborn....

01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:10,568
He's just stubborn, that's all.

01:15:10,639 --> 01:15:12,106
That's plane do in any minutes.

01:15:14,409 --> 01:15:15,899
Attention!

01:15:17,746 --> 01:15:20,840
- Attention!
- General, please you gotta get wholy yourself.

01:15:20,916 --> 01:15:23,043
Get wholly of myself indeed.

01:15:23,118 --> 01:15:27,418
My orders being defied by a stupid, insubordinate jack-ass.

01:15:27,489 --> 01:15:29,787
- Keep it hit shaft for this.
- It should be, General.

01:15:29,858 --> 01:15:32,258
This would solve a lot of problems.

01:15:32,327 --> 01:15:33,760
You can't do this, to me.

01:15:33,829 --> 01:15:37,265
You're ungrateful, unpatriotic, meansinable ...

01:15:41,136 --> 01:15:43,070
Believe me, Francis, I don't know...

01:15:43,138 --> 01:15:45,265
Japs got the news, anymore than you do.

01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:47,808
Yes, there's a few questions I'd like to ask on that subject.

01:15:47,876 --> 01:15:49,844
If he won't talk to me, he won't talk to you.

01:15:49,912 --> 01:15:51,846 
Oh..I wasn't talk to the mule, sir.

01:15:56,919 --> 01:15:59,717
Lieutenant Stirling? Who did you talk to, about Francis?

01:15:59,788 --> 01:16:03,622
- Sir?
- Who did you talk to, about Francis?

01:16:04,326 --> 01:16:08,319
Well, no one, sir. There is, I'm alone to Maureen..Uh.., Miss. Gelder.

01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:09,762
Ohh..  Ms. Gelder?

01:16:09,831 --> 01:16:12,322
But I had to prove that I wasn't crazy, sir.

01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:16,360
And I just happened to mention that Francis' talked to the General too.

01:16:16,438 --> 01:16:18,838
That's all I wanted to know.

01:16:18,907 --> 01:16:21,501
Sir. I may have the answer to everything. I should know in a few minutes.

01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:23,738
- May I be excused, sir?
- Very well.

01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:29,483
G-2 Intelligence!

01:16:29,551 --> 01:16:32,042
Ahh, shoot him and we might win this war.

01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:33,417
My sentiment's exactly the same.

01:16:36,124 --> 01:16:38,684
Francis, I knew you won't let the General down.

01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:43,493
Keep you sure, son. The gentlemen of the press will get not copy out of me.

01:16:43,565 --> 01:16:45,556 
Oh..but how you not use your head, Francis.

01:16:45,634 --> 01:16:48,535
You stand on the threshold of fame such as few men ...

01:16:48,604 --> 01:16:51,869
Few people ... Few creatures have ever enjoyed.

01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:53,931
Oh, I wouldn't that joy, sir.

01:16:55,243 --> 01:16:57,268
Just picture it, Francis.

01:16:57,346 --> 01:17:01,112
A special unit had activated to handle you. Waited on handled for it.

01:17:01,183 --> 01:17:03,583
Millions listening to you every word.

01:17:03,652 --> 01:17:06,712  
One of the most "report and sales" sucks I've ever heard.

01:17:06,788 --> 01:17:11,919
One that follow of it, sir, make me shivers right down on my tale.

01:17:11,994 --> 01:17:15,691
Think of the opportunity. Why? You're a nobody.

01:17:15,764 --> 01:17:19,598
Well, the "John-nobody", sir, who will win in this mule's war?

01:17:23,305 --> 01:17:26,797
Francis, I've given 35 years of my life to the army.

01:17:26,875 --> 01:17:29,366
And, in all modesty, up to now ...

01:17:29,444 --> 01:17:31,537
I have been considered a pretty sound military man.

01:17:31,613 --> 01:17:35,049
But my all career will be ruined today if you don't talk.

01:17:35,117 --> 01:17:37,415
And mine will be ruined if I do.

01:17:38,620 --> 01:17:41,612
But Francis, think about my family.

01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:44,557
You got me there, General. I haven't got a family.

01:17:44,626 --> 01:17:48,426
And according to all scientific report, I can never quite one.

01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:51,398
But the answer is still  no.

01:17:51,466 --> 01:17:54,230
And I'm still the commanding General of this theater..

01:17:55,604 --> 01:17:57,162
Have a good mine and a horse sweeped you

01:17:57,239 --> 01:18:01,869
Easy now, general. Suppose you raise one little finger to me.

01:18:01,943 --> 01:18:05,743
Just a General slap, mind you. Then suppose I talk.

01:18:05,814 --> 01:18:10,615
I can see the headlines. "Defenseless Mule, beating by General".

01:18:10,686 --> 01:18:12,677
What a story?.

01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:16,681
You're.. You're not worth the gun powder to blow you'd use it...

01:18:16,758 --> 01:18:19,090
Mess at my life, mess at my command...

01:18:19,161 --> 01:18:21,152
Mess at the all war ever.

01:18:21,229 --> 01:18:22,856
You too!

01:18:22,931 --> 01:18:25,195
Out of my sight, both of you.

01:18:28,336 --> 01:18:30,930 
Yes sir. Come on, Francis.

01:18:32,007 --> 01:18:35,807
- Well, your surly don't argue, you see?
- Lesson, Lieutenant. Lesson.

01:18:39,181 --> 01:18:41,115
Get back there, Lieutenant. You can't leave now.

01:18:41,183 --> 01:18:43,310
But the General's orders, sir?

01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:48,822
Lord, sir, the correspondents have arrived. They are on the way in.

01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:51,324
Get that animal another site, keep another site.

01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:52,792
Yes sir.

01:18:52,861 --> 01:18:55,523
Sir, the correspondents must didn't see the mule.

01:18:55,597 --> 01:18:58,930
Why not? Hiding him it wouldn't hide my humiliation.

01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,763
But you not gonna be humiliated ...

01:19:00,836 --> 01:19:02,770
and the correspondents have going in the story.

01:19:04,139 --> 01:19:07,870
- Behind the backboard, Lieutenant.
- Stop talking in circle, Hooker.

01:19:07,943 --> 01:19:09,672
I'm in no mood for guessing game.

01:19:09,745 --> 01:19:13,875
Geeral,  Miss. Gelder has been induced to substitute.

01:19:13,949 --> 01:19:16,509
She is ready and waiting for the press conference.

01:19:16,585 --> 01:19:18,519
Does that answer things for you, sir?

01:19:19,521 --> 01:19:22,888
Yes Yes.

01:19:22,958 --> 01:19:26,724
And if she doesn't make them forget what they came for...

01:19:26,795 --> 01:19:29,229
I do not know war correspondents.

01:19:29,297 --> 01:19:31,231
Very good, Colonel.

01:19:32,234 --> 01:19:34,395
I'm afraid I've been a bit testy.

01:19:34,469 --> 01:19:36,232
I can well understand, sir.

01:19:36,304 --> 01:19:38,499
Come on. Let's meet the press.

01:19:40,041 --> 01:19:41,941
Lieutenant, swirling around him.

01:19:42,010 --> 01:19:45,207
- The tail show it.
- Yes sir.

01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:47,214
- And ... Lieutenant.
- Yes sir?

01:19:47,883 --> 01:19:50,374
- Not a word, none of either obvious.
- No sir.

01:19:57,926 --> 01:20:02,363
I wonder.. I wonder what Maureen can do to satisfy the correspondents.

01:20:02,430 --> 01:20:05,092
Well. How about a fan dance? Yeah.. Hey, hey.

01:20:06,968 --> 01:20:11,166
And as you know, this is one of the manly area, 
of action of this war.

01:20:11,239 --> 01:20:14,003
This strategic situation here is entirely dependent...

01:20:14,075 --> 01:20:16,475
..from the army there up and flows supply.

01:20:16,545 --> 01:20:19,605
The airlift is, you're aware, definitely limited.

01:20:19,681 --> 01:20:21,615
General, what about this Tokyo broadcast?

01:20:21,683 --> 01:20:24,743
But, despite of all obstacles, the job is being done.

01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:26,720
General, do we can look at this famous mule?

01:20:27,589 --> 01:20:28,749
How about a picture to mule talk?

01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:30,655
A surprising interview with this amazing mule?

01:20:30,725 --> 01:20:33,421
Yeah, what does that Tokyo rose on talking mule?

01:20:33,495 --> 01:20:38,728
Oh, yes, the story of the mule..who's winning the war single hunt...

01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:40,927
Single footing

01:20:41,002 --> 01:20:44,699
What we could do with an army of sent true remarkable creatures. 
Ehh?, Colonel Hooker?

01:20:44,773 --> 01:20:47,207
Indeed, General. But I did with lot of through without them ...

01:20:47,275 --> 01:20:49,641
in despite the enemy ridiculous propaganda.

01:20:49,711 --> 01:20:52,339
As much as we may spoil news value for you, gentlemen ...

01:20:52,414 --> 01:20:54,644
But I'm not quite ready for the psychopathy ward.

01:20:55,784 --> 01:20:57,809
But you're not going on empty-hands.

01:20:57,886 --> 01:21:01,049
Colonel Hooker, I suppose you bring the boys a lots of story for them.

01:21:01,122 --> 01:21:04,888
Let do General. As you know, both the British and American armed forces ...

01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:08,293
They have been operating in this theater with complete collaboration.

01:21:08,363 --> 01:21:11,764
Sometime back, British intelligence picked up the trail 
of a very beautiful young woman's  ...

01:21:11,833 --> 01:21:13,926
supposedly French, suspected of being part of...

01:21:14,002 --> 01:21:16,470
a network of agents collaborating with the enemy.

01:21:16,538 --> 01:21:19,666
She was last active somewhere in Sumatra.

01:21:19,741 --> 01:21:23,074
Recently one of our patrols, picked the supposed daughter of a Dutch trade agent...

01:21:23,144 --> 01:21:24,907
Also a very beautiful young woman,

01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:27,448
helping her papy at their own trading post in the Burma hills.

01:21:27,515 --> 01:21:31,483
No, that's not true.
Shh.. Shh.. Shh..

01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:35,489
We suspect it, she was the same girl, but we have no proves.

01:21:35,557 --> 01:21:37,525
So we dig around an ingenual young officer ...

01:21:37,592 --> 01:21:40,390
Who assigned to intelligence and dangling as bait.

01:21:40,462 --> 01:21:43,454
So, that's what you were doing in the G-2, a booby trap.

01:21:43,531 --> 01:21:46,728
When you see the girl and then take a look at Lieutenant Stirling ...

01:21:46,801 --> 01:21:48,860
you'll realize that her only interested in him ...

01:21:48,937 --> 01:21:52,065
could it been for the purpose of getting information.

01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:55,439
We've sorted that the Lieutenant give her miss information.

01:21:55,510 --> 01:21:59,606
But, when he contact the fantastic story of the talking mule ...

01:21:59,681 --> 01:22:01,672
Miss. Gelder couldn't resist it.

01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:04,275
She send it over to the enemy and the trap  exploded.

01:22:05,253 --> 01:22:08,154
Well gentlemen, there's your story. Well coming worth?

01:22:08,223 --> 01:22:10,885
Sure, if you look as good as you listens.

01:22:15,063 --> 01:22:16,928
- Bring Miss Gelder in..
- Let me go.

01:22:19,234 --> 01:22:22,931
Pigs. So brave, so strong, these Americans ...

01:22:23,004 --> 01:22:25,632
Two of them to guard one girl.

01:22:25,707 --> 01:22:28,403
- You have no evidence against me.
- No evidence?

01:22:28,476 --> 01:22:30,034 
You're the only one to whom Lieutenant Stirling...

01:22:30,111 --> 01:22:33,012
told that have safe talking mule tale... the story.

01:22:33,081 --> 01:22:35,049
And then this information got to Tokyo.

01:22:35,116 --> 01:22:37,016
What prove have you got that I sent it?  

01:22:37,085 --> 01:22:39,713
Who accuses me, anyway? That lunatic Lieutenant?

01:22:39,788 --> 01:22:41,221
Ohh. No, Maureen.

01:22:41,289 --> 01:22:44,690
I.. I didn't. I haven't it thing in do it this way. I don't it believe any of it.

01:22:44,759 --> 01:22:46,693
Sir, this is obvious a terrible mistake why...

01:22:46,761 --> 01:22:50,822
- She could not done it.
- But you could. And you did, didn't you?

01:22:52,667 --> 01:22:55,101
Anyone crazy enough to think that a mule can talk ...

01:22:55,170 --> 01:22:57,570
is crazy enough to send messages to the enemy.

01:22:57,639 --> 01:22:59,732
Is not so, Peter?

01:23:01,242 --> 01:23:04,211
- Why do you not confess?
- Maureen.

01:23:04,279 --> 01:23:08,045
Lieutenant, keep your mouth shut. I'll handle this.

01:23:08,116 --> 01:23:12,485
Sir, this dame got in so good be able to say anything.

01:23:12,554 --> 01:23:15,546
Silence, Francis, you speak when you spoken to.

01:23:20,729 --> 01:23:24,096
So you.. you can talk.

01:23:24,165 --> 01:23:27,225
I hope that kiss a duck, I can talk.

01:23:29,904 --> 01:23:33,271
And now I'll tell you how she got that information to the enemy.

01:23:33,341 --> 01:23:36,105
You know that all Burmese temple after Road of the Peace?

01:23:36,177 --> 01:23:39,305
Well you'll find a couple of natives, hanging around the back door.

01:23:39,381 --> 01:23:41,747
They're her messengers boys.

01:23:41,816 --> 01:23:44,410
Maureen, why do not you say something? Why do not you deny it?

01:23:44,486 --> 01:23:47,148 
I deny it? You stupid idiot. It's all your fault.

01:23:47,222 --> 01:23:50,783
- You and that stinking mule.
- Take her out.

01:23:50,859 --> 01:23:52,690
No, you cannot do this.. They have no proof.

01:23:56,097 --> 01:24:00,830
Thank you, Francis. I'm glad to have at least one jack-ass at my command.

01:24:04,472 --> 01:24:09,205
Gentlemen, I didn't model to deceive you, but in the interest self...

01:24:09,277 --> 01:24:12,178
Spy stories, there a dime a dozens, but a talking mule...

01:24:12,247 --> 01:24:14,306
But I still don't believed it mass of nosense.

01:24:14,382 --> 01:24:16,748
Sure, the whole thigs is a gag.

01:24:16,818 --> 01:24:21,187
We're right to be in play per subtle or gonna as balmy as lieutenant.

01:24:21,256 --> 01:24:22,985
This thing can't talk.

01:24:23,058 --> 01:24:26,186
A mule is the stupidest beast in the existence.

01:24:26,261 --> 01:24:28,786
Next the correspondents.

01:24:28,863 --> 01:24:32,128
So you're genius that know everything, huh?

01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:35,328 
Well, I got some news for ya'. 

01:24:35,403 --> 01:24:39,840
Quote! There's a war going on. Unquote.

01:24:39,908 --> 01:24:43,469
So go sell ya' papers. We got some fight that do.

01:24:45,547 --> 01:24:48,414
Francis. Please, remember that these gentlemen count thousands of miles to meet you.

01:24:48,483 --> 01:24:50,883
And if I had known, I'd have baked a cake.

01:24:50,952 --> 01:24:54,786
Francis, these men are leading representative of the press.

01:24:54,856 --> 01:24:57,222
Just go to proves what I always said.

01:24:57,292 --> 01:25:00,352
The only reliable reading is the encyclopedia.

01:25:02,330 --> 01:25:06,357
Well.. what am I supposed to do, is to write their all wash pond?

01:25:06,434 --> 01:25:09,426
All we wanted a few statement.

01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:12,439
Okay, shoot.

01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:16,100
How did you learn to talk?

01:25:16,177 --> 01:25:18,941
Hehh stupid question. How'd you learn?

01:25:19,013 --> 01:25:23,074
- Well, my mother taught me.
- Must they have quite a struggle.

01:25:23,151 --> 01:25:25,415
Francis, a little courtesy. that's an order.

01:25:25,487 --> 01:25:26,852
Yes sir.

01:25:26,921 --> 01:25:30,084
Francis, how about a couple of shots with you and the General?

01:25:30,158 --> 01:25:31,853
Well, That's up to you, sir.

01:25:31,926 --> 01:25:34,121
But certainly, certainly.

01:25:34,963 --> 01:25:37,397
All right, gentlemen?

01:25:37,465 --> 01:25:38,762
Shoot.

01:25:51,246 --> 01:25:53,180
Attention!

01:25:55,550 --> 01:25:57,381
High!

01:26:00,522 --> 01:26:03,116
"The Car of Francis"

01:26:03,191 --> 01:26:06,922
You understand, General, I'm making this trip under protest.

01:26:06,995 --> 01:26:08,986
Orders from Washington.

01:26:09,063 --> 01:26:11,190
They're convinced the correspondents are crazy ...

01:26:11,266 --> 01:26:13,598
and do holding the stories until you arrive.

01:26:13,668 --> 01:26:15,602
They've assigned six men to you as ordinances.

01:26:15,670 --> 01:26:17,535
You will arrive to Washington on Sunday.

01:26:17,605 --> 01:26:19,869
And then on you're under the direct orders of the Pentagon.

01:26:19,941 --> 01:26:21,602
Everything is being reins for your convenience.

01:26:21,676 --> 01:26:25,134
Just what I deserve for not keep my big mouth shut.

01:26:25,213 --> 01:26:27,147
But think of the good you can do.

01:26:27,215 --> 01:26:29,843
War bond driver, speeches, public appearances.

01:26:29,918 --> 01:26:31,579
You'll have a tremendous influence.

01:26:31,653 --> 01:26:34,679
Horse peter's. I'm a fighting mule.

01:26:34,756 --> 01:26:38,385
I wouldn't be surprised if I'd run out all known shows.

01:26:38,459 --> 01:26:42,020
But.. but you couldn't do that, Francis.

01:26:42,096 --> 01:26:45,896
No.. I couldn't. But then again, maybe I could.

01:26:47,068 --> 01:26:49,036
You better get starting.

01:26:50,405 --> 01:26:52,771
Good boy.

01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:55,434
You know something? I'm gonna miss you, Lieutenant.

01:26:58,346 --> 01:27:02,248
Gee Francis, well, it's only for a couple of days.

01:27:02,317 --> 01:27:03,944
I'm going meet you in Washington.

01:27:04,018 --> 01:27:06,714
Oh, must be something a matter with me.

01:27:06,788 --> 01:27:08,619
Why?

01:27:08,690 --> 01:27:11,488
Oh, I ain't to leave you.

01:27:13,461 --> 01:27:15,986
Well, keep you about the shine.

01:27:16,064 --> 01:27:17,964
Good bye, Francis.

01:27:18,032 --> 01:27:20,364
Yes, so long.

01:27:26,708 --> 01:27:30,610
- Take care of yourself.
- That's a hobby of mine.

01:27:31,279 --> 01:27:34,214
Amazing. Simply amazing.

01:27:41,789 --> 01:27 :44,485
- Do you have your orders? 
- Yes sir. 24 copies I've of 'em.

01:27:44,559 --> 01:27:48,791
Right, I'll you proceed directly from the airport to the Pentagon. 
Francis would be there.

01:27:48,863 --> 01:27:52,594
You will stay with him reporting the General Fullbright Morale services.

01:27:52,667 --> 01:27:55,465
- Well your plane will leave in a few minutes.
- Goodbye Sir.

01:27:55,536 --> 01:27:57,595
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, sir.

01:27:59,007 --> 01:28:00,497
Take good care of Francis.

01:28:00,575 --> 01:28:03,874
- Good luck, Lieutenant.
- Thank You.

01:28:05,079 --> 01:28:07,479
What? Wait, Lieutenant. Wait.

01:28:09,250 --> 01:28:11,548
Are you sure?

01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:13,685
It's official?

01:28:15,823 --> 01:28:17,950
All of them?

01:28:19,994 --> 01:28:22,053
No word of him?

01:28:24,165 --> 01:28:26,895
Yes, just as soon as you get anything.

01:28:26,968 --> 01:28:28,902
I'll wait.

01:28:35,476 --> 01:28:36,602
There's been an accident.

01:28:36,678 --> 01:28:38,236
What's, sir?

01:28:38,313 --> 01:28:40,781
The plane has crashed.

01:28:40,848 --> 01:28:42,873
Francis' crashed?

01:28:42,950 --> 01:28:45,441
Oh no. What happened, sir?

01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:47,715
- We do not know.
- Where?

01:28:47,789 --> 01:28:51,247
In the hills of Kentucky, a few minutes ago. No further details.

01:28:51,326 --> 01:28:52,759
The Crew?

01:28:52,827 --> 01:28:54,761
All parachuted and safety.

01:28:55,863 --> 01:28:58,058
The mule refused to leave the plane.

01:29:04,372 --> 01:29:07,535
So I was returned the United States.

01:29:07,608 --> 01:29:10,133
I've searched directly to the plane.

01:29:10,211 --> 01:29:12,475
Francis's body wasn't there.

01:29:12,547 --> 01:29:15,744
Then, I've started coming the Kentucky countryside.

01:29:15,817 --> 01:29:17,978
I looked everywhere, sir. Everywhere.

01:29:18,052 --> 01:29:20,316
And of course, you've never found him.

01:29:20,388 --> 01:29:23,050
- What's, sir?
- I say you've never found him.

01:29:23,124 --> 01:29:24,614
Ohh yes sir. I found him.

01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:27,286
You... What?

01:29:27,362 --> 01:29:29,694
- I found him, sir.
- You did?

01:29:29,764 --> 01:29:31,629
But what happened to him?

01:29:31,699 --> 01:29:33,360
Oh, he is living with me in my house.

01:29:33,434 --> 01:29:36,164
- living with you now?
- Yes.

01:29:36,237 --> 01:29:39,764
- Would you like you come to meet him?
- Who? Me?

01:29:44,712 --> 01:29:49,411
<I> My baby is </ i> <i> the other side of the ocean </ i>

01:29:49,484 --> 01:29:53,386
<I> My baby is </ i> <i> across the sea </ i>

01:29:58,526 --> 01:30:02,656
- Is this the animal?
- Yes sir. This is Francis.

01:30:03,364 --> 01:30:07,926
Wake up, fella. I've brought the bank's president
Mr. Munroe out to meet you.

01:30:08,002 --> 01:30:10,994
He's heard the story and thought am I a little crazy.

01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:12,664
So I want to put his mind to rest.

01:30:12,740 --> 01:30:15,937
Into your mind that need to rest, not mine young man.

01:30:16,010 --> 01:30:19,776
If that stupid looking thing has a thought and take ..
that along.. talk.

01:30:19,847 --> 01:30:21,371
And I'm a jack-ass too.

01:30:21,449 --> 01:30:23,383
Here we go, again....

01:30:28,890 --> 01:30:34,851
"The End"
