One for you.

75
00:03:27,973 --> 00:03:31,170
How come we can't ever have
just, like, a salad?

76
00:03:31,643 --> 00:03:33,668
Be grateful, Juan Pablo.

77
00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:36,209
Today is especially delicious.

78
00:04:48,754 --> 00:04:52,246
Orphans, smile and be happy,

79
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:56,188
for God has blessed us
with a new teacher.

80
00:04:56,695 --> 00:04:59,755
She hails from
the Oaxaca Parish Convent

81
00:04:59,998 --> 00:05:04,526
of the Immaculate Heart
Sisters Lady Mountains

82
00:05:05,537 --> 00:05:06,765
of Guadalupe.

83
00:05:07,806 --> 00:05:11,139
Sister Encarnacion.

84
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:30,061
Thank you, Brother.

85
00:05:42,207 --> 00:05:47,076
Children, today I want to tell you
a story about Isabel.

86
00:05:58,924 --> 00:06:00,824
Okay, new game.

87
00:06:00,926 --> 00:06:03,861
- Go get it!
- Hey, that's my ball!

88
00:06:12,437 --> 00:06:13,495
Sister.

89
00:06:16,074 --> 00:06:17,473
I'm Ignacio.

90
00:06:19,111 --> 00:06:21,272
God be with you, Ignacio.

91
00:06:22,814 --> 00:06:23,940
Anyways,

92
00:06:25,617 --> 00:06:27,551
I was wondering
if you would like to join me

93
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:30,588
in my quarters this night
for some toast.

94
00:06:34,993 --> 00:06:36,119
Look alive!

95
00:06:38,096 --> 00:06:41,827
There is a man sick with influenza.
I need for you to pay him a visit, huh?

96
00:06:41,933 --> 00:06:43,958
- But the sister and I...
- You are always complaining

97
00:06:44,069 --> 00:06:46,264
of never having priestly duties.

98
00:06:46,371 --> 00:06:48,271
Here is your big duty, huh?

99
00:06:49,374 --> 00:06:50,534
Go now,

100
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,108
so that Sister and I may talk
of holy things.

101
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:29,780
I like your cow.

102
00:07:59,444 --> 00:08:00,809
Where is he?

103
00:08:15,961 --> 00:08:19,863
Holy Father, please receive this man
to your kingdom.

104
00:08:51,496 --> 00:08:53,430
Thank you for coming here today.

105
00:08:56,968 --> 00:08:59,869
This man lived a good life.

106
00:09:01,573 --> 00:09:04,406
He had a wonderful woman,

107
00:09:07,412 --> 00:09:08,936
a lush garden,

108
00:09:15,387 --> 00:09:18,322
and a collection
of Russian nesting dolls.

109
00:09:20,525 --> 00:09:22,254
May he rest in peace.

110
00:09:53,158 --> 00:09:54,216
Okay.

111
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:00,323
Hey!

112
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,386

00:11:46,471 --> 00:11:47,563
Okay.

118
00:11:59,918 --> 00:12:01,283
How's it going?

119
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,881
It's very late, Ignacio.

120
00:12:09,861 --> 00:12:11,328
Give me a second.

121
00:12:27,712 --> 00:12:28,804
Good toast.

122
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,509
So,

123
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:41,623
<i>everyone calls you guero.</i>

124
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:46,756
My mother was a Lutheran missionary
from Scandinavia

125
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:49,999
and my father,
a deacon from Mexico.

126
00:12:59,344 --> 00:13:01,403
They tried to convert each other,

127
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,845
but they got married instead.

128
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:08,852
And then they died.

129
00:13:25,904 --> 00:13:29,863
So anyways, let's get down
to the nitty-gritty.

130
00:13:31,042 --> 00:13:32,236
Tell me,

131
00:13:32,944 --> 00:13:34,912
who is this Encarnacion?

132
00:13:38,349 --> 00:13:39,407
Well,

133
00:13:40,485 --> 00:13:43,579
my favorite color is light tan.

134
00:13:44,756 --> 00:13:48,351
My favorite animal is puppies.

135
00:13:49,694 --> 00:13:51,457
I like serving the Lord.

136
00:13:52,564 --> 00:13:53,963
Hiking.

137
00:13:54,866 --> 00:13:56,026
Play volleyball.

138
00:13:56,134 --> 00:13:57,795
You gotta be kidding me.

139
00:13:58,002 --> 00:14:01,563
Everything you just said
is my favorite thing to do

140
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:03,540
every day.

141
00:14:05,143 --> 00:14:08,772
So, you enjoy yourself here
at the Brotherhood?

142
00:14:11,282 --> 00:14:14,410
The children, I love the children.
They are my heart.

143
00:14:15,153 --> 00:14:17,087
But to tell you the truth,

144
00:14:18,223 --> 00:14:21,283
the brothers make me cook stew
and stuff all day,

145
00:14:21,392 --> 00:14:24,327
but they don't give me money
for fresh ingredients.

146
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:31,162
And they don't think I know a buttload
of crap about the Gospel, but I do.

147
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:32,828
Okay?

148
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:39,370
Today, I saw a man in town.

149
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:45,580
People were throwing daisies at him
and giving him goodies.

150
00:14:47,218 --> 00:14:49,880
Sometimes I would like
that kind of respect.

151
00:14:49,988 --> 00:14:51,455
Who was this man?

152
00:14:53,258 --> 00:14:56,091
<i>Well, to tell you the truth,
he was a luchador.</i>

153
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:00,891
Wrestling is ungodly, Ignacio.

154
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,668
People cheer for him,
but he is a false idol.

155
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:09,034
Whatever.

156
00:15:16,314 --> 00:15:18,077
Be patient, Brother.

157
00:15:18,683 --> 00:15:20,310
This, too, shall pass.

158
00:15:46,778 --> 00:15:48,109
What is this?

159
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,579
Leftovers.

160
00:15:50,682 --> 00:15:51,944
Enjoy.

161
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:54,051
There is no flavor.

162
00:15:54,152 --> 00:15:56,416
There are no spices.
Where are the chips?

163
00:15:57,121 --> 00:15:58,918
Somebody stole them.

164
00:15:59,023 --> 00:16:02,049
Did you not tell them
that they were the Lord's chips?

165
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,855
I was trying to...

166
00:16:04,896 --> 00:16:08,195
- You are useless, Ignacio.
- Silence, Brothers.

167
00:16:11,669 --> 00:16:15,628
This is the worst lunch
I ever had.

168
00:16:16,374 --> 00:16:18,501
Your only job is to cook.

169
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:23,807
Do you not realize
I have had diarrhea since Easters?

170
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:26,942
Okay.

171
00:16:27,719 --> 00:16:30,210
Maybe I am not meant
for these duties.

172
00:16:30,588 --> 00:16:34,786
Cooking duty. Dead guy duty.

173
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:38,385
Maybe it's time for me
to get a better duty.

174
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,145
I think your food is good.

175
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:03,419
I am the gatekeeper
of my own destiny,

176
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:07,284
and I will have my glory day
in the hot sun.

177
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:08,817
Okay?

178
00:17:12,163 --> 00:17:13,323
See you.

179
00:18:37,615 --> 00:18:39,480
Hey! Listen to me! Hey!

180
00:18:39,584 --> 00:18:41,882
<i>Mucho take it easy.
I need your help.</i>

181
00:18:47,158 --> 00:18:48,716
Take out the legs!

182
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,991
Listen to me!

183
00:18:51,095 --> 00:18:54,531
Today, I have the chance of a lifetime,
but first I need a man.

184
00:18:54,632 --> 00:18:55,860
Get off me!

185
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:01,895
Don't you see?

186
00:19:02,006 --> 00:19:05,703
Your skills plus my skills
in the ring, tag team.

187
00:19:06,511 --> 00:19:07,808
You're crazy!

188
00:19:08,946 --> 00:19:11,642
Aren't you tired
of getting dirt kicked in your face?

189
00:19:11,749 --> 00:19:12,841
I am!

190
00:19:14,886 --> 00:19:17,047
Don't you want a little taste
of the glory?

191
00:19:17,155 --> 00:19:19,089
See what it tastes like?

192
00:19:19,257 --> 00:19:20,246
No!

193
00:19:23,761 --> 00:19:25,695
If we win, we get 200 pesos!

194
00:20:06,404 --> 00:20:07,632
Chancho!

195
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:10,267
Chancho!

196
00:20:14,745 --> 00:20:17,339
Chancho, I need to borrow
some sweats.

197
00:20:17,448 --> 00:20:18,938
Are you leaving us?

198
00:20:19,617 --> 00:20:21,812
No, Chancho,
I would never leave you.

199
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,853
I just need to borrow
some sweats.

200
00:22:22,273 --> 00:22:24,639
NEW WRESTLERS TOURNAMENT

201
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,221
His hair. We bet his hair.

202
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:16,117
What?

203
00:23:16,227 --> 00:23:18,127
You can take the Stallion.

204
00:23:18,629 --> 00:23:20,392
I'll take the Pony.

205
00:23:20,498 --> 00:23:21,692
I can't wrestle him.

206
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:25,758
But you are tall and fast like
a gazelle. You can do it.

207
00:23:26,437 --> 00:23:28,564
Pray to the Lord for strength.

208
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:31,301
I don't believe in God,
I believe in science.

209
00:23:34,478 --> 00:23:36,241
You have not been baptized?

210
00:23:38,349 --> 00:23:40,442
Hey. How you doing?

211
00:23:42,653 --> 00:23:43,984
He's good.

212
00:23:46,891 --> 00:23:48,051
Hello!

213
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:51,259
I'm talking to you.
I will come.

214
00:23:51,862 --> 00:23:53,921
Save me a piece of that corn.

215
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,134
Save me a piece of that corn
for later.

216
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:07,168
Hey. Take it easy.

217
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:23,149
Come on, Esqueleto!

218
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:27,556
Okay.

219
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:35,163
No problem.
We are dancing.

220
00:24:42,847 --> 00:24:44,144
That didn't hurt!

221
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,012
And then I disappear!

222
00:24:52,089 --> 00:24:55,490
Taste it. Yes!
I'm going to pull you.

223
00:25:00,831 --> 00:25:01,923
The shoe!

224
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:15,172
Anaconda squeeze.

225
00:25:16,046 --> 00:25:17,206
Okay.

226
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:23,217
Nacho! Nacho! Nacho!
Nacho! Nacho!

227
00:25:26,824 --> 00:25:30,817
Semental! Semental!
Semental! Semental!

228
00:25:35,132 --> 00:25:37,498
Those guys were
a couple of wussies, huh?

229
00:25:38,736 --> 00:25:40,636
They scalped my hairs, okay?

230
00:25:42,339 --> 00:25:44,807
- I look hideous.
- Come on, baby.

231
00:25:45,443 --> 00:25:48,173
And you gave them permission
to hurt me like this.

232
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:51,612
But I couldn't have anybody see
my face, Steven, come on.

233
00:25:53,284 --> 00:25:54,512
Tonight,

234
00:25:55,219 --> 00:25:57,153
I felt something deep inside me,

235
00:25:57,688 --> 00:25:59,315
I've never felt before.

236
00:26:05,596 --> 00:26:07,530
Do you remember that one time

237
00:26:08,232 --> 00:26:10,530
when everyone was shouting
my name

238
00:26:11,802 --> 00:26:14,464
and I used my strength
to rip my blouse?

239
00:26:15,139 --> 00:26:16,128
Yeah.

240
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,038
And I saw them
knock you unconscious, all right?

241
00:26:28,419 --> 00:26:29,579
What's this?

242
00:26:29,987 --> 00:26:31,921
It's money.
What did you think?

243
00:26:33,557 --> 00:26:34,922
But we lost.

244
00:26:35,626 --> 00:26:37,025
We all get a piece.

245
00:26:37,528 --> 00:26:38,688
Listen,

246
00:26:38,996 --> 00:26:41,260
the people, they like you guys.

247
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:45,828
Come back next week,
and I will get another fight for you.

248
00:28:46,824 --> 00:28:47,950
Chancho.

249
00:28:50,461 --> 00:28:52,088
When you are a man

250
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:55,726
sometimes you wear stretchy pants

251
00:28:56,634 --> 00:28:57,794
in your room.

252
00:28:58,335 --> 00:28:59,563
It's for fun.

253
00:29:00,537 --> 00:29:03,131
Don't worry.
I won't tell nobody.

254
00:29:17,688 --> 00:29:19,747
I'm a little concerned right now.

255
00:29:20,524 --> 00:29:23,391
About your salvation and stuff.

256
00:29:24,662 --> 00:29:26,789
How come
you have not been baptized?

257
00:29:27,898 --> 00:29:30,560
Because I never got around
to it, okay?

258
00:29:38,909 --> 00:29:41,673
I don't know why you always
have to be judging me

259
00:29:42,212 --> 00:29:44,612
because I only believe
in science.

260
00:29:45,349 --> 00:29:46,680
But tonight,

261
00:29:47,551 --> 00:29:50,281
we are going up
against Satan's Cavemen.

262
00:29:51,255 --> 00:29:54,019
And I just thought
it would be a good idea if you...

263
00:29:54,124 --> 00:29:56,183
Praise the Lord!

264
00:30:05,169 --> 00:30:07,729
Hey, we're not allowed
to watch that.

265
00:32:04,054 --> 00:32:05,817
Hey! Hey!

266
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:07,618
Tag me!

267
00:33:08,752 --> 00:33:10,219
What? What are you doing?

268
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,185
No, no, no, no! No, no!

269
00:33:18,095 --> 00:33:19,426
Ignacio.

270
00:33:19,529 --> 00:33:21,463
<i>No! No, no, no!
No, no, no!</i>

271
00:33:21,565 --> 00:33:22,759
What the...

272
00:33:23,033 --> 00:33:24,000
Move!

273
00:34:58,095 --> 00:34:59,995
Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight!

274
00:35:00,097 --> 00:35:03,089
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

275
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,963
Chancho! Put him down!

276
00:35:05,068 --> 00:35:07,229
- Fight! Fight!
- Put him down, Chancho! Stop it!

277
00:35:07,337 --> 00:35:10,306
- Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
- Please, stop it!

278
00:35:10,707 --> 00:35:13,107
Break it up! Break it up!
Break it up!

279
00:35:13,844 --> 00:35:15,539
What's wrong with you?

280
00:35:17,547 --> 00:35:18,707
But, Sister,

281
00:35:19,149 --> 00:35:22,209
<i>they are just ninos trying
to release their wiggles.</i>

282
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:26,052
Ignacio, they are wrestling
in a sacred place.

283
00:35:27,924 --> 00:35:32,190
Okay, orphans, listen to me.
Listen to Ignacio.

284
00:35:33,096 --> 00:35:34,927
I know it is fun to wrestle.

285
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:37,560
A nice pile-drive to the face,

286
00:35:37,901 --> 00:35:39,698
or a punch to the face,

287
00:35:40,537 --> 00:35:42,300
but you cannot do it.

288
00:35:42,439 --> 00:35:46,102
Because it is in the Bible
not to wrestle your neighbor.

289
00:35:46,476 --> 00:35:48,239
So you've never wrestled?

290
00:35:48,478 --> 00:35:50,810
Me? No, come on. Don't be crazy.

291
00:35:51,648 --> 00:35:54,981
Listen, I know the wrestlers
get all the fancy ladies,

292
00:35:56,019 --> 00:35:57,384
and the clothes,

293
00:35:58,021 --> 00:36:00,649
and the free creams and lotions,

294
00:36:01,591 --> 00:36:03,320
but my life is good.

295
00:36:03,927 --> 00:36:05,326
Really good.

296
00:36:06,263 --> 00:36:10,461
I get to wake up every morning
at 5:00 a. m. and make some soup.

297
00:36:11,468 --> 00:36:13,993
It's the best.
I love it.

298
00:36:15,138 --> 00:36:18,596
I get to lay in a bed by myself
all of my life.

299
00:36:19,743 --> 00:36:21,108
It's fantastic.

300
00:36:26,716 --> 00:36:27,705
Go.

301
00:36:28,218 --> 00:36:29,412
Go away!

302
00:36:30,487 --> 00:36:32,045
Read some books!

303
00:36:49,172 --> 00:36:51,402
Have you ever had feelings
for a nun?

304
00:36:52,109 --> 00:36:53,235
No way.

305
00:36:57,914 --> 00:36:59,279
There is this nun.

306
00:37:01,051 --> 00:37:04,748
I just wish I could take off this robe
so she could see how strong I am.

307
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:08,689
Well, bring her
to our next wrestling match.

308
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,488
Yeah, right.

309
00:37:11,928 --> 00:37:14,362
Then I'll get kicked
out of the monastery.

310
00:37:19,536 --> 00:37:20,798
I have an idea.

311
00:37:21,838 --> 00:37:22,896
Tell me.

312
00:37:23,406 --> 00:37:25,237
Take her on a date tonight

313
00:37:25,575 --> 00:37:28,408
and I will bring some of my friends
to beat you up,

314
00:37:28,745 --> 00:37:30,508
but we will let you win.

315
00:37:37,287 --> 00:37:39,084
So where are you taking me?

316
00:37:39,189 --> 00:37:42,590
Well, Sister,
I saw a bum here today.

317
00:37:42,959 --> 00:37:44,449
There were two bums,

318
00:37:44,694 --> 00:37:46,184
and I said to myself,

319
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:49,594
"Let's talk to these guys
about the Gospel. "

320
00:37:50,667 --> 00:37:52,134
Well, where are they?

321
00:37:53,603 --> 00:37:54,934
I don't see them.

322
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,808
They should be coming by.

323
00:38:03,547 --> 00:38:05,606
Where is your robe, Ignacio?

324
00:38:07,717 --> 00:38:10,151
It was stinky.

325
00:38:10,487 --> 00:38:12,887
But these are
my recreation clothes.

326
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:22,658
- They look expensive.
- Thank you.

327
00:38:23,466 --> 00:38:24,728
I mean, yes,

328
00:38:25,802 --> 00:38:28,703
they may have
the appearance of riches,

329
00:38:28,872 --> 00:38:32,330
but beneath the clothes,
we find a man.

330
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:34,800
And beneath a man,

331
00:38:36,513 --> 00:38:40,506
we find his nucleus.

332
00:38:41,851 --> 00:38:44,319
- Nucleus?
- Yes.

333
00:38:47,691 --> 00:38:50,660
Listen, I don't like the way
those guys just looked at you.

334
00:38:51,928 --> 00:38:54,692
Hey! Can't you see
this woman's a nun?

335
00:38:56,299 --> 00:38:58,597
And if you guys
have a problem with that,

336
00:38:58,702 --> 00:39:00,670
well, you can just fight me.

337
00:39:21,324 --> 00:39:22,382
Okay.

338
00:39:23,226 --> 00:39:24,488
You ready?

339
00:39:24,594 --> 00:39:26,789
You messed with
the wrong guy this time.

340
00:39:26,896 --> 00:39:28,761
You ever seen these moves? Huh?

341
00:39:29,299 --> 00:39:31,267
You see these moves? Huh?

342
00:39:31,368 --> 00:39:33,928
You think you gonna... Huh?

343
00:39:34,037 --> 00:39:36,665
- Come on!
- This way. I think he's over here.

344
00:39:54,758 --> 00:39:56,020
Surprise.

345
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,551
Get that corn out of my face!

346
00:40:08,338 --> 00:40:10,203
Release! Release!

347
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:17,175
I looked like a fool last night!
What took you so long?

348
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:23,417
It's no use.

349
00:40:23,887 --> 00:40:25,650
I wanna be a great fighter,

350
00:40:26,289 --> 00:40:29,224
but I can't even beat
a couple of guys in the street.

351
00:40:40,804 --> 00:40:41,896
Nacho.

352
00:40:42,806 --> 00:40:45,366
I think I know someone
who can help you.

353
00:40:45,475 --> 00:40:47,238
- The Lord?
- No.

354
00:40:47,944 --> 00:40:49,639
He's a water gypsy.

355
00:40:50,046 --> 00:40:52,344
He know wheres to find eagle eggs.

356
00:40:52,449 --> 00:40:53,780
Eagle eggs?

357
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:57,684
I'm not listening to you.
You're crazy.

358
00:40:59,255 --> 00:41:02,418
Nacho, I'm telling you.
This is for reals.

359
00:41:03,093 --> 00:41:05,994
His eagle eggs possess
magical powers.

360
00:41:08,932 --> 00:41:12,265
You could become the greatest fighter
who ever lived.

361
00:41:24,881 --> 00:41:29,375
In order for you
to become empowered

362
00:41:30,286 --> 00:41:31,776
by the eagle,

363
00:41:32,789 --> 00:41:35,155
you must climb that cliff,

364
00:41:36,726 --> 00:41:38,717
find the egg,

365
00:41:39,195 --> 00:41:41,129
crack open one of them,

366
00:41:42,198 --> 00:41:44,359
and then swallow the yolk.

367
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:49,235
So, what you're saying to me

368
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:52,108
is if I can eat this yolk,

369
00:41:53,109 --> 00:41:56,374
my moves will become
the best in the whole world.

370
00:41:58,915 --> 00:42:00,246
Definitely.

371
00:42:03,386 --> 00:42:04,683
High five.

372
00:43:36,913 --> 00:43:40,405
- Summon your eagle powers.
- What do you think I am doing?

373
00:44:16,586 --> 00:44:19,111
Eagle powers, come to me!

374
00:44:19,522 --> 00:44:20,648
Please!

375
00:44:57,927 --> 00:44:59,451
Tag. Tag! Tag!

376
00:45:26,089 --> 00:45:28,489
Those eggs were a lie, Steven.

377
00:45:29,158 --> 00:45:30,318
A lie!

378
00:45:31,394 --> 00:45:33,555
They gave me no eagle powers!

379
00:45:34,063 --> 00:45:36,088
They gave me no nutrients!

380
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:38,226
Sorry.

381
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,003
I don't want to get paid to lose.

382
00:45:46,709 --> 00:45:48,233
I want to win!

383
00:45:54,183 --> 00:45:56,151
I need professional help.

384
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:59,354
I need Ramses.

385
00:46:00,757 --> 00:46:02,224
He's the best.

386
00:46:03,526 --> 00:46:06,086
We need to get in
with him and his buddies.

387
00:46:06,195 --> 00:46:08,163
We must learn their ways.

388
00:46:08,998 --> 00:46:12,627
But they are pros.
They only hang out with each other.

389
00:46:12,935 --> 00:46:14,664
Then we must go pro!

390
00:46:15,204 --> 00:46:18,731
But going pro is not that easy.
It's political, obviously.

391
00:46:19,709 --> 00:46:21,233
<i>My area, amigo.</i>

392
00:46:37,827 --> 00:46:39,351
You see that guy over there?

393
00:46:40,463 --> 00:46:42,397
<i>His name is Senor Ramon.</i>

394
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:45,395
He's Ramses' manager

395
00:46:46,102 --> 00:46:48,502
and he owns all of the big arenas.

396
00:46:51,107 --> 00:46:53,507
He's having a party tomorrow night.

397
00:46:54,343 --> 00:46:57,210
We need to go and show him
we mean business,

398
00:46:57,447 --> 00:47:00,041
that we are ready for the big leagues.

399
00:47:02,318 --> 00:47:05,344
Over there in the tree
is a chipmunk nest.

400
00:47:06,322 --> 00:47:10,019
Here we have the corn.
The best in the city. It's delicious.

401
00:47:10,727 --> 00:47:14,060
That is where I get the day-old chips,
over in a secret place.

402
00:47:14,697 --> 00:47:16,665
And that is a crazy lady.

403
00:47:17,734 --> 00:47:21,602
So now you got a little taste
of what I do.

404
00:47:23,306 --> 00:47:25,570
It's pretty dang exciting, huh?

405
00:47:31,047 --> 00:47:32,207
Ramses!

406
00:47:37,453 --> 00:47:39,921
- How do you know him?
- He's the best.

407
00:47:40,022 --> 00:47:41,455
No, he's not.

408
00:47:46,462 --> 00:47:48,453
May I have his autograph?

409
00:47:50,299 --> 00:47:51,459
Please?

410
00:47:52,702 --> 00:47:54,932
Okay. Let me see what I can do.

411
00:48:08,284 --> 00:48:09,478
Ramses.

412
00:48:10,386 --> 00:48:11,751
How are you?

413
00:48:15,591 --> 00:48:16,580
Hi.

414
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:24,557
I was wondering
if the children could get a

415
00:48:25,635 --> 00:48:28,365
signature from you
and maybe a picture.

416
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:43,115
Listen, the kids are orphans.

417
00:48:43,219 --> 00:48:46,211
They like you. You are the best.

418
00:48:58,401 --> 00:49:00,460
This party's gonna be crazy.

419
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:02,963
I mean, we're gonna be pros.

420
00:49:05,508 --> 00:49:06,702
Feel it.

421
00:49:07,376 --> 00:49:10,038
Go on. I made them.

422
00:49:15,651 --> 00:49:16,982
Go lay down.

423
00:49:22,358 --> 00:49:24,849
Ignacio,
I've been looking for you.

424
00:49:25,061 --> 00:49:27,325
- Where have you been?
- I've been here.

425
00:49:28,097 --> 00:49:29,792
I've been sleeping.

426
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,395
In a frilly shirt and slacks?

427
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:35,628
They are my PJs.

428
00:49:37,506 --> 00:49:38,973
Can I come in?

429
00:49:39,141 --> 00:49:42,668
No, people might get
the wrong idea about you.

430
00:49:44,146 --> 00:49:45,636
Like maybe you are a floozy.

431
00:49:48,745 --> 00:49:50,406
Ignacio, I was in the kitchen

432
00:49:50,513 --> 00:49:52,879
and there's no food
for tomorrow's breakfast.

433
00:49:52,982 --> 00:49:54,244
Don't worry,
I'll take care of it.

434
00:49:54,350 --> 00:49:55,578
- But when?
- Good night.

435
00:50:01,725 --> 00:50:04,125
Hey, let go my blouse.

436
00:50:04,327 --> 00:50:06,921
We are wrestlers, too.
We are invited.

437
00:50:24,447 --> 00:50:26,938
- Give me a boost.
- Okay.

438
00:50:34,791 --> 00:50:36,782
Hey. What about me?

439
00:50:37,761 --> 00:50:39,820
I don't think I can lift you.

440
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:41,688
You are too fat.

441
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:45,397
Good luck.

442
00:51:15,665 --> 00:51:17,030
<i>Senor Ramon.</i>

443
00:51:18,268 --> 00:51:21,999
<i>- Who are you?
- I am Esqueleto, the luchador.</i>

444
00:51:23,573 --> 00:51:25,973
<i>Everybody is a luchador,
mi amigo.</i>

445
00:51:26,910 --> 00:51:30,368
I think that me and my friend
are ready to go pro.

446
00:51:33,216 --> 00:51:37,084
Ramses, would you like to fight
this man in the ring?

447
00:51:40,223 --> 00:51:43,454
So you want to make a name
for yourself, horseface?

448
00:51:44,661 --> 00:51:46,822
Win the Battle Jam next week.

449
00:51:47,330 --> 00:51:50,925
The winner will fight Ramses
in exhibition

450
00:51:51,034 --> 00:51:54,060
in front of 5,000 people.

451
00:51:56,539 --> 00:51:58,439
Then you will be a pro.

452
00:53:33,336 --> 00:53:34,701
I forgive you.

453
00:53:38,007 --> 00:53:39,838
Come here, soldier.

454
00:53:40,343 --> 00:53:42,538
How did you get up here so fast?

455
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:46,138
Secret tunnels.

456
00:53:53,890 --> 00:53:56,358
Some say wrestlers make
bad lovers.

457
00:53:57,026 --> 00:54:00,427
That they save themselves
for the ring.

458
00:54:09,238 --> 00:54:10,296
Huh?

459
00:54:11,407 --> 00:54:12,738
I love you.

460
00:54:29,559 --> 00:54:31,026
Sing!

461
00:54:31,294 --> 00:54:34,058
Sing something for Ramses!

462
00:54:36,232 --> 00:54:38,632
Okay, my friend,
this one's yours.

463
00:54:38,868 --> 00:54:39,926
What?

464
00:54:40,403 --> 00:54:41,893
This one yours.

465
00:54:56,419 --> 00:55:01,322
<i>I am singing at the party</i>

466
00:55:03,259 --> 00:55:04,988
<i>I am singing</i>

467
00:55:05,094 --> 00:55:08,894
<i>It's my turn to sing
at the party</i>

468
00:55:09,899 --> 00:55:11,924
<i>Everyone is dancing</i>

469
00:55:12,035 --> 00:55:14,936
<i>Happy party</i>

470
00:55:16,572 --> 00:55:21,407
<i>But Ramses is not dancing
He does not dance at the parties</i>

471
00:55:23,279 --> 00:55:27,443
<i>Ramses is number one
He knows the secrets of desire</i>

472
00:55:29,986 --> 00:55:34,013
<i>Ramses is the one
He puts the people all on fire</i>

473
00:55:36,459 --> 00:55:37,756
<i>Ramses</i>

474
00:55:47,937 --> 00:55:49,097
Steven!

475
00:55:50,173 --> 00:55:51,470
Come here.

476
00:56:00,116 --> 00:56:01,447
That party was lame.

477
00:56:02,151 --> 00:56:03,812
I hate that place.

478
00:56:09,625 --> 00:56:10,649
Hey!

479
00:56:19,702 --> 00:56:21,135
Take it easy.

480
00:56:59,509 --> 00:57:01,602
It sucks to be me right now!

481
00:57:05,681 --> 00:57:07,876
- How come?
- How come you think?

482
00:57:08,885 --> 00:57:12,252
I used to really like Ramses.
I wanted to become him.

483
00:57:13,389 --> 00:57:16,586
But it turns out
he's a real douche.

484
00:57:18,327 --> 00:57:23,094
Well, win the Battle Jam this week
and you can fight him yourself.

485
00:57:33,676 --> 00:57:34,870
Forget it.

486
00:57:35,645 --> 00:57:36,737
What?

487
00:57:37,914 --> 00:57:40,382
Because I can't go on
living a lie.

488
00:57:42,752 --> 00:57:44,310
Earth to Steven.

489
00:57:45,354 --> 00:57:46,753
I'm a friar.

490
00:57:47,790 --> 00:57:49,621
I'm not for that world.

491
00:57:50,092 --> 00:57:54,119
The orphans, they need me,
and I have forsaken them.

492
00:57:55,264 --> 00:57:58,324
I got no groceries for breakfast
because of you!

493
00:57:58,434 --> 00:58:01,665
I'm sick of hearing
about your stupid orphans.

494
00:58:02,104 --> 00:58:05,665
- What did you just say?
- I hate orphans.

495
00:58:06,175 --> 00:58:09,303
- Say it again to my face.
- I hate them!

496
00:58:09,579 --> 00:58:10,705
Come again?

497
00:58:10,813 --> 00:58:13,577
I hate all the orphans
in the whole world.

498
00:58:25,995 --> 00:58:27,963
I'm not listening to you.

499
00:58:28,831 --> 00:58:32,699
You only believe in science.
That's probably why we never win.

500
00:58:32,969 --> 00:58:34,869
We never win because you are fat.

501
00:58:48,985 --> 00:58:50,714
<i>Buenos dias, Sister.</i>

502
00:58:53,956 --> 00:58:55,651
So, what you cooking?

503
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:58,657
Breakfast.

504
00:59:10,106 --> 00:59:13,735
Ignacio, you have a responsibility
to these children.

505
00:59:14,377 --> 00:59:15,537
I know.

506
00:59:17,647 --> 00:59:20,207
Well, where have you been?

507
00:59:21,150 --> 00:59:25,086
I've been gone because I had
a lot of church-y opportunities lately,

508
00:59:25,187 --> 00:59:26,882
outside of the orphanage.

509
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:31,121
Like what?
Where were you last night?

510
00:59:34,630 --> 00:59:38,566
To tell you the truth,
I went to a wrestling match.

511
00:59:41,537 --> 00:59:44,028
You went to watch a wrestling match?

512
00:59:47,710 --> 00:59:48,904
Kind of.

513
00:59:49,745 --> 00:59:51,804
You are a man of the cloth.

514
00:59:52,481 --> 00:59:54,415
<i>Lucha libre, it's a sin.</i>

515
00:59:55,318 --> 00:59:57,149
But why?

516
00:59:57,787 --> 01:00:00,654
Because those men
fight for vanity,

517
01:00:01,257 --> 01:00:02,554
for money,

518
01:00:03,025 --> 01:00:04,390
for false pride.

519
01:00:06,295 --> 01:00:08,661
Yes, it's terrible. Terrible.

520
01:00:10,333 --> 01:00:12,631
But is it always a sin to fight?

521
01:00:14,470 --> 01:00:15,459
No.

522
01:00:17,673 --> 01:00:19,664
If you fight
for something noble,

523
01:00:20,276 --> 01:00:22,744
or for someone
who needs your help,

524
01:00:23,312 --> 01:00:25,974
only then will God bless you
in battle.

525
01:00:29,785 --> 01:00:31,980
You must pray for forgiveness.

526
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:39,293
Excuse me, Ignacio.

527
01:01:23,506 --> 01:01:25,098
<i>Precious Father,</i>

528
01:01:25,207 --> 01:01:28,074
<i>why have you given me
this desire to wrestle</i>

529
01:01:28,177 --> 01:01:30,771
<i>and then made me
such a stinky warrior?</i>

530
01:01:31,747 --> 01:01:36,207
<i>Have I focused too much on my boots
and all my fame and my stretchy pants?</i>

531
01:01:37,253 --> 01:01:38,345
<i>Wait a second.</i>

532
01:01:38,454 --> 01:01:41,423
<i>Maybe you want me to fight
and give everything I win</i>

533
01:01:41,524 --> 01:01:43,253
<i>to the little ones
who have nothing</i>

534
01:01:43,359 --> 01:01:46,055
<i>so they can have better foods
and a better life.</i>

535
01:01:47,963 --> 01:01:49,555
<i>Yeah, maybe that.</i>

536
01:01:49,999 --> 01:01:52,968
<i>Okay, if I win tonight
at the Battle Jam,</i>

537
01:01:53,102 --> 01:01:55,093
<i>I will know that you bless
my mission</i>

538
01:01:55,204 --> 01:01:58,605
<i>and that you want me to be
a wrestling servant of you.</i>

539
01:02:00,876 --> 01:02:02,138
<i>I smell cookies.</i>

540
01:02:03,045 --> 01:02:04,273
Flame! Flame!

541
01:02:06,549 --> 01:02:09,541
No, no, no! No, no, no, no, no!

542
01:02:13,789 --> 01:02:15,416
Roll, you fool!

543
01:02:21,997 --> 01:02:23,760
Flame, flame, flame!

544
01:02:54,396 --> 01:02:56,091
Yes, it's true!

545
01:02:57,233 --> 01:03:00,293
<i>I am Nacho, the luchador.</i>

546
01:03:05,808 --> 01:03:06,832
Who?

547
01:03:07,076 --> 01:03:09,237
Maybe you have seen me on TV.

548
01:03:14,350 --> 01:03:16,443
Nacho!

549
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:27,252
No. This is forbidden.

550
01:03:27,997 --> 01:03:29,294
I knew it.

551
01:03:30,499 --> 01:03:32,433
He is not a man of God.

552
01:03:36,438 --> 01:03:37,632
Tonight,

553
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:40,941
I will fight
the seven strongest men in town,

554
01:03:41,343 --> 01:03:42,935
maybe the world,

555
01:03:45,114 --> 01:03:46,638
and I will win

556
01:03:47,116 --> 01:03:50,608
because our Heavenly Father
will be in the ring with me.

557
01:03:50,786 --> 01:03:52,879
And he and I will win
10,000 pesos.

558
01:03:52,988 --> 01:03:54,387
And with it,

559
01:03:54,857 --> 01:03:57,849
I will buy the orphans
a big bus

560
01:03:58,561 --> 01:04:01,621
to go on field trips to parks
and places like that.

561
01:04:02,298 --> 01:04:03,663
I'm serious!

562
01:05:28,317 --> 01:05:30,877
Nipple twist!

563
01:07:27,302 --> 01:07:29,167
You can't win them all.

564
01:07:42,050 --> 01:07:43,176
Nacho!

565
01:07:44,453 --> 01:07:46,182
Where are you going?

566
01:07:48,791 --> 01:07:51,385
There is no place for me
in this world, Chanchito.

567
01:07:52,961 --> 01:07:54,929
I don't belong out there

568
01:07:55,597 --> 01:07:57,656
and I don't belong in here,

569
01:07:58,267 --> 01:08:00,565
so I'm going into the wilderness,

570
01:08:00,736 --> 01:08:03,170
probably to die.

571
01:08:04,540 --> 01:08:06,531
Well, you might need this.

572
01:08:14,650 --> 01:08:17,619
My mother gave it to me
before she died.

573
01:08:18,253 --> 01:08:21,745
<i>It was her lucky machete.
You can have it.</i>

574
01:08:38,907 --> 01:08:41,205
I hope to see you again,
little Chancho.

575
01:08:45,047 --> 01:08:46,912
Maybe in the next life.

576
01:10:52,107 --> 01:10:54,075
How did you find me here?

577
01:10:54,643 --> 01:10:56,270
I saw you from the village.

578
01:11:08,757 --> 01:11:10,122
I have some news.

579
01:11:13,762 --> 01:11:16,424
Silencio isn't going to be able
to fight Ramses.

580
01:11:20,102 --> 01:11:21,592
He got injured.

581
01:11:44,726 --> 01:11:46,887
Silencio bruised his bunions.

582
01:11:47,195 --> 01:11:49,356
They are swollen really hard.

583
01:11:51,633 --> 01:11:54,295
He's not gonna be able
to fight tonight.

584
01:11:55,570 --> 01:11:57,401
You were second place.

585
01:11:57,906 --> 01:11:59,840
You get to fight Ramses.

586
01:12:01,743 --> 01:12:03,938
But I have given up wrestling.

587
01:12:06,882 --> 01:12:09,783
Nacho, you are a great fighter.

588
01:12:10,886 --> 01:12:13,616
And you got something
none of these guys have.

589
01:12:23,899 --> 01:12:26,094
The childrens need a real hero.

590
01:12:27,803 --> 01:12:30,795
But I thought you hated
all the orphans in the whole world.

591
01:12:33,041 --> 01:12:34,406
Not anymore.

592
01:12:35,043 --> 01:12:36,442
I like them.

593
01:12:39,247 --> 01:12:41,215
And they need you, Nacho.

594
01:13:02,370 --> 01:13:03,428
Okay.

595
01:13:42,611 --> 01:13:45,512
<i>Dear Sister, I know
you probably hate my guts by now</i>

596
01:13:45,614 --> 01:13:49,641
<i>and already believe that I must have
died long ago in the wilderness.</i>

597
01:13:49,751 --> 01:13:52,219
<i>But you are wrong,
I'm still alive.</i>

598
01:13:52,721 --> 01:13:55,656
<i>Tonight I'll be fighting
the greatest wrestler who ever lived,</i>

599
01:13:55,757 --> 01:13:57,224
<i>the great Ramses.</i>

600
01:13:57,325 --> 01:13:58,656
<i>I know you don't like wrestling,</i>

601
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:01,923
<i>but know that I am leaving
all my monies to the orphans.</i>

602
01:14:02,030 --> 01:14:06,296
<i>And if I die in the ring, know that
I always loved you as a brother in God.</i>

603
01:14:06,935 --> 01:14:08,163
<i>Ignacio.</i>

604
01:14:09,271 --> 01:14:13,537
<i>P.S. If we didn't end up taking
our vows of celibacy,</i>

605
01:14:13,909 --> 01:14:18,141
<i>we could maybe get married
and have a family with some ninos.</i>

606
01:14:19,147 --> 01:14:21,081
<i>But, you know, whatever.</i>

607
01:14:21,850 --> 01:14:24,375
<i>Hug, hug, kiss, kiss,</i>

608
01:14:24,553 --> 01:14:26,817
<i>hug, hug, big kiss,</i>

609
01:14:27,122 --> 01:14:30,956
<i>little hug, kiss, kiss,
little kiss.</i>

610
01:15:20,141 --> 01:15:22,541
Ramses is the number one.

611
01:15:23,912 --> 01:15:26,710
His legs are number one.

612
01:15:27,449 --> 01:15:30,350
His eyes are number one.

613
01:15:31,152 --> 01:15:33,985
His muscles are number one.

614
01:15:35,290 --> 01:15:38,191
Ramses is the number one.

615
01:15:45,567 --> 01:15:47,728
While I was in the wilderness

616
01:15:49,237 --> 01:15:51,432
I wrote a song for Encarnacion

617
01:15:53,942 --> 01:15:55,273
in my mind.

618
01:15:56,778 --> 01:15:59,269
- Shall I sing it for you?
- Sure.

619
01:16:10,692 --> 01:16:14,287
<i>When the fantasy has ended</i>

620
01:16:14,863 --> 01:16:17,855
<i>And all the children are gone</i>

621
01:16:18,733 --> 01:16:22,225
<i>Something good inside me</i>

622
01:16:22,837 --> 01:16:25,567
<i>Helps me to carry on</i>

623
01:16:25,674 --> 01:16:29,440
<i>I ate some bugs
I ate some grass</i>

624
01:16:29,544 --> 01:16:33,241
<i>I used my hand
To wipe my tears</i>

625
01:16:33,348 --> 01:16:37,284
<i>To kiss your mouth
I'd break my vow</i>

626
01:16:37,385 --> 01:16:40,980
<i>No, no, no
No, no, no way, Jose</i>

627
01:16:41,256 --> 01:16:43,383
<i>Unless you want to</i>

628
01:16:43,491 --> 01:16:47,552
<i>Then we'd break
our vows together</i>

629
01:16:48,763 --> 01:16:53,132
<i>Encarnacion</i>

630
01:16:53,234 --> 01:16:56,499
<i>Encarnacion</i>

631
01:16:56,604 --> 01:16:59,129
<i>Encarnacion</i>

632
01:17:00,975 --> 01:17:04,467
<i>Encarnacion</i>

633
01:17:06,014 --> 01:17:07,743
They are ready for you now.

634
01:17:40,248 --> 01:17:43,740
Nacho! Nacho! Nacho!

635
01:18:05,607 --> 01:18:07,370
Maybe we should pray.

636
01:18:12,814 --> 01:18:17,217
Dear Lord, please bless Nacho
with nutrients and strength.

637
01:18:17,685 --> 01:18:19,084
- Amen.
- Amen.

638
01:18:19,888 --> 01:18:23,790
Ramses! Ramses! Ramses! Ramses!

639
01:18:29,597 --> 01:18:31,792
Ramses! Ramses!

640
01:18:49,217 --> 01:18:50,514
High five.

641
01:18:51,419 --> 01:18:52,852
Take it easy.

642
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:07,225
Go, go, go, go, go.

643
01:20:17,372 --> 01:20:21,775
Nacho! Nacho! Nacho! Nacho!

644
01:20:21,876 --> 01:20:23,969
Nacho! Nacho!

645
01:22:28,770 --> 01:22:30,863
Okay. Vertebrae kick!

646
01:22:46,020 --> 01:22:47,180
Timber!

647
01:23:59,494 --> 01:24:00,756
I did it!

648
01:24:26,921 --> 01:24:29,355
Hey! We did it!

649
01:24:30,725 --> 01:24:31,817
Yes!

650
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:01,346
Yes!

651
01:25:01,823 --> 01:25:03,484
- Yes!
- Yes!

652
01:25:10,431 --> 01:25:11,762
Yes!

653
