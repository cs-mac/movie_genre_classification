NUMMELA FILMI & PORKKANA RYHMÄ
presents

2
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,626
Let's do a tail slate.

3
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:44,741
<i>This was the last</i> scene of
<i>Excalibur 4: The Rod in the Stone.</i>

4
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:47,088
I just want to tell you all-

5
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:50,668
that l have taken out a huge loan
to finance this film.

6
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:56,971
My mum, my granny and my sax-wife's
ex-mother acted as guarantors.

7
00:02:57,928 --> 00:03:00,147
Thanks, everyone...

8
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:03,473
The wrap party is cancelled.
Fuck you!

9
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:11,327
Kurre, how was my acting?
I think I found the right focus.

10
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,696
It was a penetrating portrayal.

11
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:18,164
Kurre, wait.

12
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:23,247
Here's <i>the poster draft for
Excalibur 3: The Rod in the Stone.</i>

13
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:29,344
Not bad, eh? You can see the trolls,
the cannibals and the wizard.

14
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:32,337
<i>This is Excalibur 4.
-what?</i>

15
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:37,305
<i>The first two were Excalibur and
Excalibur 2: The Return of the King.</i>

16
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:40,304
<i>The Return of the G-String?
-The King.</i>

17
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:43,551
<i>The Return of the Dingaling.</i>

18
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:47,650
This will be awesome. This is good.

19
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:50,730
Tomi Paatelainen
promised to work for us.

20
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:54,943
He's a great graphic designer.
He married our Stina.

21
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:58,194
Now they're living
in our villa in Kallvik.

22
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:03,746
You lovade to fix the lodge.
- I'm busy.

23
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:07,197
You're always like that!
You don't do anything.

24
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:12,249
Hey, I'm working. I have to make
the poster for Excalibur.

25
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:20,083
Your dad is breathing down my neck.
- Then hire a decorator.

26
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,463
I don't know any builders.

27
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:34,189
<i>Directory enquiries. May I help you?
-Mauri Mähönen, Tyrnävä.</i>

28
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:38,498
<i>Here's a master builder
named Monkki Mähönen.</i>

29
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:42,367
<i>It might be a professional name.
- Put me through, please.</i>

30
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:45,237
<i>Just a moment.
-Hello?</i>

31
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:52,247
<i>This is</i> Tomi <i>Paatelainen, hi.
-You little prick. What's up?</i>

32
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:57,454
I'm in advertisement business.
Film posters and graphic design.

33
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:01,594
Listen, are you still doing
renovation jobs?

34
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:07,193
This place is rotten.
It should be torn down.

35
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:11,139
This is our family villa.
One should respect history...

36
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,230
Don't you teach your father to fuck.

37
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:17,645
Am I not allowed
to peek inside the walls?

38
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:21,270
Stina, let Monkki check the building.

39
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:24,294
Let's take a look at the structure.

40
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:31,243
Shit a brick and fuck me with it.
It's always like this.

41
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:38,350
Well, what do you see?
- This is full of shit!

42
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:43,543
Do you smell it?

43
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,519
Your old bass guitar.
Have you played recently?

44
00:05:57,149 --> 00:06:01,693
What's the meaning of this?
- We're old band mates.

45
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:05,872
Monkki was the drummer of Cobra.
- I should've known.

46
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:10,167
Hey, cow. Don't you know
how good a bassist your hubby is?

47
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:14,625
Time to make a hole.

48
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:18,963
We asked you here to fix the lodge.

49
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:24,104
You can sleep in our sauna.
- All right.

50
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,730
For the lodge I have thought...
Please, take a look.

51
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:33,258
A fifties-style wallpaper -

52
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:37,220
a white panel ceiling
and drapes from this fabric.

53
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:42,398
Shit! That flower stung me!
Fucking hell...

54
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:46,825
Tomi, I have pots and pans in my van.
- Pots and pans?

55
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:51,327
Drums? Really?

56
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:54,841
Let's put them in the lodge.
They'll fit in there.

57
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:59,627
He's an intolerable oaf.
He doesn't listen and calls me a cow.

58
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:02,850
Darling Stina,
he's a man of the people.

59
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:05,961
You should try to be nice to him.

60
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:13,731
You forgot the brochures
on the porch.

61
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:19,060
It'd be jättekiva if you could make
the lodge a little bit cosier...

62
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:22,659
Okay, but I need
a full case of beer.

63
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:26,401
Are you going to bring it
now or immediately?

64
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:28,564
<i>Javisst,</i> of <i>course.</i>

65
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:05,908
Vad is that? I was startled.

66
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:10,402
Good double bass drumming. Listen.

67
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:17,841
I'm sure he's not going to play
for long at his age.

68
00:08:56,703 --> 00:09:02,090
"He's not going to play for long.“
He's a tireless... grottman.

69
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:05,953
What is grottman in Finnish?
-A caveman.

70
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:19,104
It sounded really good.
You've always had good drum sounds.

71
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:21,800
That's right.
- Is this the old drum set?

72
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:27,822
Stina asked me...
or rather told me to ask you -

73
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:30,530
when are you going to begin
your work?

74
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:33,704
Is this a labour camp?
- Of course not.

75
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:38,083
No pressure from me.
- How much will you pay me?

76
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:41,620
Of course we'll pay you.
what is your hourly rate?

77
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:46,500
Do you think I'm gonna count hours?
- Of course not.

78
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:50,716
It's a thousand euros a day. In cash.
- That's quite a lot.

79
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:57,422
Hey, come on, compadre.
Your old lady is loaded.

80
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:03,558
What are these fucking slimeballs?

81
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:08,099
It's scallop pasta.
- It's shit, you trollop!

82
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:12,321
I want shepherd's pie and sausages
before I starve to death.

83
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:15,157
And bring me the hard stuff.

84
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:19,501
On the double!

85
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:25,044
Hey, Monkki. Have some mercy.
-"Have some mercy."

86
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:29,005
Give me some sub.
I want an advance on wages.

87
00:10:29,213 --> 00:10:34,895
...5,800, 5,900, 6,000.

88
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:40,597
Is the lodge going to be ready
in time for our crayfish party?

89
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:48,015
I have a couple of
wallpaper choices.

90
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:53,730
Give me the booze.

91
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:27,731
Now he stopped.
- I'm scared.

92
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:33,643
You är going to Helsinki tomorrow.
I'm stuck here with that monkey man.

93
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,209
Everything's going to be okay.

94
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:05,509
Did it go through?

95
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:08,609
What? Are you shagging?

96
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:11,073
Yuck.

97
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:29,913
<i>It burns!</i>

98
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,761
<i>My arse is on fire!</i>

99
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:14,009
<i>Toni Paatelainen. Leave a message.</i>

100
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:17,586
It's <i>jag.</i> Listen, Tomi...

101
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:22,000
Mähönen was in our toilet.
Luckily, he's gone now.

102
00:13:22,094 --> 00:13:27,088
He took our money.
I hope he's not coming tillbaka.

103
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:36,611
What's the matter, Stina?
Are you ill?

104
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:39,367
No, everything's fine.

105
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:00,748
Let's play "Wild Beast".

106
00:14:54,186 --> 00:14:57,733
Amazing women by the sea!

107
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:11,048
Do you have any Coca-Cola?
I can't drink this straight.

108
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:20,786
Stina, they're really nice guys.

109
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:27,588
Gerhard Rihmakallo is
a German mushroom expert -

110
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,683
who moved to Finland in the '80s.

111
00:15:30,848 --> 00:15:33,636
His real name is
Gerhard ScheiBenhaus.

112
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:36,271
He's the king of riffs.

113
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:41,784
And the singer,
David Foster aka Tapio Mäkinen -

114
00:15:41,859 --> 00:15:44,327
is my old schoolmate.

115
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:49,410
He's working for the municipality of
Tyrnävä, marking baseball lines.

116
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:57,386
How do you know them?
- They are Cobra.

117
00:16:00,419 --> 00:16:04,334
Gerhard, you're the brains
in your band.

118
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,974
You seem like an intelligent man.

119
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,857
Do you understand Swedish?
Talar du svenska?

120
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:16,304
Okay, let's try German.

121
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:45,975
<i>Hjälp!-'</i>

122
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:09,956
This is a new song,
"David's On Fire".

123
00:17:10,489 --> 00:17:13,941
It begins with a massive guitar riff.

124
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:18,207
The drumming begins with a gong.
And it's awesome -

125
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:21,202
to have our bassist playing with us.

126
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:27,734
Now the going's so good
that I could use a beer.

127
00:18:27,983 --> 00:18:35,481
Välkommen to our traditional
crayfish party here in Kallvik.

128
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:40,742
I have invited a couple of important
co-operation partners to join us.

129
00:18:40,871 --> 00:18:43,624
Here's a film director
and my dear friend -

130
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:46,839
<i>Kurt “KurreKurre” von Riikonen.</i>

131
00:18:47,002 --> 00:18:53,017
Maybe you could say something about
your fantastic new film, Excalibur}.

132
00:18:54,635 --> 00:18:56,545
Four.

133
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:06,568
The film's genre is not just sci-fi.
There's also a dash of fantasy.

134
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:10,025
And here's my dear vän-

135
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:15,372
the editor-in-chief of
The Sensationalist, Julle Rekola.

136
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:23,827
I've had a gay old time with Julle.
Our co-operation has been great.

137
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:27,741
Kalle, Kurre and everyone -

138
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:32,136
it's always a great pleasure
to be with real men's men -

139
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:37,011
whether on land, sea or air.

140
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:40,983
Skål, everyone. To crayfish.

141
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:04,614
Now I feel we should play "Lizard".

142
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:14,955
What the helvete is this?

143
00:20:41,325 --> 00:20:44,991
Who the hell are you?

144
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:47,798
You have no...

145
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:51,258
Hey, Swede. Shut the fuck up.

146
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:56,585
Didn't you hear what David said?
He said "hush".

147
00:20:57,257 --> 00:21:01,173
David, go ahead.
- Gerhard, you had something to say.

148
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:05,847
Go ahead, Gerhard.
- Let's play "Fireball".

149
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:24,693
My darling <i>lilla</i> Stina will now come
with me to talk about your future.

150
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:29,501
And I'm going to give the Excalibur
poster to a good graphic designer.

151
00:21:29,998 --> 00:21:33,285
And Tomi... You're fired.

152
00:21:33,544 --> 00:21:37,933
You have two days
to get rid of that riffraff.

153
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:56,692
<i>Drink some water.
Now we're going to calm down...</i>

154
00:22:16,545 --> 00:22:18,621
what are you thinking?

155
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:22,164
My wife's gone.

156
00:22:23,927 --> 00:22:28,258
Don't you worry.
Now we can practice in peace.

157
00:22:29,516 --> 00:22:33,467
Look, it's Leather Jaska,
Mullethead and Stud.

158
00:22:33,979 --> 00:22:36,518
But where's Spunk?

159
00:22:36,732 --> 00:22:39,994
There he is! Spunk is coming!

160
00:22:44,489 --> 00:22:48,950
TWO DAYS LATER

161
00:23:01,924 --> 00:23:04,557
<i>what the helvete?!</i>

162
00:23:04,635 --> 00:23:08,585
They're just setting up the gear.
The party is tomorrow.

163
00:23:32,371 --> 00:23:35,254
Hey, this guy is causing trouble.

164
00:23:36,959 --> 00:23:43,140
Kalle, you're running wild.
why are you rampaging?

165
00:23:43,215 --> 00:23:46,976
What is happening here?
- The guys are setting up the gear.

166
00:23:47,094 --> 00:23:51,638
Cobra is playing tomorrow.
- It'll attract over 600 people.

167
00:23:51,723 --> 00:23:54,820
Cobra's concert?
- You're dumb as a doorknob.

168
00:23:54,977 --> 00:23:57,445
This is a great place.

169
00:23:57,604 --> 00:24:01,365
Rihmakallo said this point of land
is made for festivals.

170
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:06,021
Just add parking, tents,
the stage and a bar.

171
00:24:06,154 --> 00:24:11,577
When we cut down those trees,
there's room for 15 to 20,000 people.

172
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,879
A festival? 50,000 people?

173
00:24:14,037 --> 00:24:18,747
The lodge could be used as a jail.
Do you want to go to jail, Kalle?

174
00:24:19,126 --> 00:24:21,914
Cow... I mean Stina.
-Vad?What?

175
00:24:22,004 --> 00:24:26,643
Why are you always so tense?
You're whining day and night.

176
00:24:28,135 --> 00:24:30,543
Tomi is a bass artist.

177
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:35,975
And don't you worry about
the renovation. Spunk will handle it.

178
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:40,641
I don't have time to do it.
I'm a percussion instrument artist.

179
00:24:41,106 --> 00:24:47,121
Are you going to live here?
- Absolutely not.

180
00:24:47,237 --> 00:24:51,568
Maybe during the summer
and the Christmas season.

181
00:24:55,537 --> 00:25:01,161
Tomi?
- Sorry, baby. This is the real me.

182
00:25:10,552 --> 00:25:14,764
You're not coming here.

183
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:17,643
Go away and come back tomorrow.

184
00:25:17,726 --> 00:25:22,614
Shay what you want. We're coming in.
- No, you're not. Shtay away.

185
00:25:24,107 --> 00:25:30,039
Are you making fun of my lishp?
-of courshe not. Shtay away.

186
00:25:30,197 --> 00:25:33,744
He's making fun of you.
- Are you making fun of my lishp?

187
00:25:33,867 --> 00:25:37,699
He's making fun of Jouni.
- Wanna get your head smashed in?

188
00:25:40,916 --> 00:25:45,994
I'll wipe that shmile off your face.
- Please, go away.

189
00:25:46,755 --> 00:25:51,430
He's afraid of you.
- Attack!

190
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:56,173
Have a gingerbread ice cream.
- I don't like them.

191
00:25:56,306 --> 00:26:01,016
Have an ice jolly.
- That's not real ice cream.

192
00:26:03,522 --> 00:26:07,698
Everyone getsh a choc ice.

193
00:26:09,444 --> 00:26:12,861
I want a choc ice.
- I'll have the same.

194
00:26:14,741 --> 00:26:18,028
Me too.
- And me.

195
00:26:19,788 --> 00:26:24,593
One choc ice, please.
- What has happened to you, Risto?

196
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:27,714
I fell off my moped in a bend.

197
00:26:28,338 --> 00:26:32,218
One choc ice, please.
- You have a black eye and bruises.

198
00:26:32,384 --> 00:26:36,086
I fell off in the same bend.
-One choc ice, please.

199
00:26:36,263 --> 00:26:39,300
Pentti, did you crash your ATV
in the same bend?

200
00:26:39,433 --> 00:26:42,150
Yeah, it was a pile-up.

201
00:26:43,604 --> 00:26:47,685
It must be one slippery bend.
- One choc ice, please.

202
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:51,447
Jarmo, I guess you crashed
your moped in the same bend.

203
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:55,580
No, we got our arses kicked
by a group of heavy metal roadies.

204
00:26:55,741 --> 00:27:01,827
We didn't manage
to throw even one punch. Bye.

205
00:27:02,164 --> 00:27:07,965
The men in our village...
-Risto is ugly and stupid.

206
00:27:08,128 --> 00:27:12,008
Pentti is fat.
Antti is just super annoying.

207
00:27:12,132 --> 00:27:15,798
I bet they're all virgins.
- And then there's Jouni.

208
00:27:17,763 --> 00:27:21,275
A pathetic splutterer.
- Thinks he's the leader.

209
00:27:21,391 --> 00:27:25,532
Have you noticed how he looks at you?
- But he's really small.

210
00:27:25,646 --> 00:27:30,225
Could you imagine being with him?
- Not even if he was the last man.

211
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:35,496
Take a look at their little thingies.
They're just a bunch of buffoons.

212
00:27:42,454 --> 00:27:45,242
I'm not buying anything
from thish shop.

213
00:27:49,962 --> 00:27:52,596
Jouni, why didn't you buy ice cream?

214
00:27:53,757 --> 00:27:57,969
I'll put plenty of sausages
in your fresh sausage soup.

215
00:28:00,597 --> 00:28:03,694
That's nice. I like lumpsh.

216
00:28:03,934 --> 00:28:06,437
COMEDY, DRAMA
CRIME

217
00:28:09,982 --> 00:28:13,743
Don't watch your films until dawn.

218
00:28:13,986 --> 00:28:17,248
Then you'll just snooze
till afternoon.

219
00:28:17,406 --> 00:28:22,151
<i>What is that movie called?
-Shpiderman 3.</i>

220
00:28:52,733 --> 00:28:56,363
Risto, be careful with those.
Jouni is calling.

221
00:28:58,447 --> 00:29:00,037
<i>Antti.
-where are you?</i>

222
00:29:00,199 --> 00:29:01,860
What?
-where are you?

223
00:29:02,201 --> 00:29:06,531
We're watching Pentti's dad's cows.
- Come to the Shkull Cave.

224
00:29:07,164 --> 00:29:08,920
Okay.)'-

225
00:29:12,711 --> 00:29:15,464
We're going to rob
jushtiina's shop.

226
00:29:15,589 --> 00:29:19,006
What?
- We're going to rob Jushtiina's shop.

227
00:29:19,176 --> 00:29:22,462
All the cash and tenderloinsh.
- Why?

228
00:29:22,804 --> 00:29:25,379
Becaushe they're fucking with ush.

229
00:29:26,725 --> 00:29:30,107
It's an impossible mission.
- I have a plan.

230
00:29:30,604 --> 00:29:35,349
Justiina is going to kill us.
- What is this plan of yours?

231
00:29:37,611 --> 00:29:43,068
You've all sheen Harrishon Ford in
Witnessh with those Amish guysh.

232
00:29:43,659 --> 00:29:48,119
<i>Me and Antti will go to Justiina's
shop dressed ash the Amish.</i>

233
00:29:49,873 --> 00:29:55,260
<i>We'll shurvey the shecurity shystems.
There are two shurveillance camerash.</i>

234
00:29:56,630 --> 00:30:01,269
<i>A shecurity guard visitsh jushtiina's
shop at leasht once a day.</i>

235
00:30:01,552 --> 00:30:05,502
<i>He enters through the back door
which has a double padlock.</i>

236
00:30:05,764 --> 00:30:10,902
That's a tricky one. But the shop
has a weak point: the tin roof.

237
00:30:11,937 --> 00:30:16,196
The ceiling is made of shoft
Haltex panelsh. Passh it around.

238
00:30:18,277 --> 00:30:22,572
We're entering through the ceiling.
-justiina will strangle us.

239
00:30:22,739 --> 00:30:26,500
We need a wild bunch.
Shpecialists!

240
00:30:26,743 --> 00:30:31,382
Shteven Sheagal, Shylvester
Shtallone, Charlesh Bronson and...

241
00:30:32,666 --> 00:30:35,051
...Telly Shavalash!

242
00:30:35,294 --> 00:30:38,141
Where are you going, Rishto?
- Mealtime.

243
00:30:38,255 --> 00:30:42,135
It's my mealtime, too.
- I'm going for a swim.

244
00:30:42,801 --> 00:30:44,877
Let's go, boys.

245
00:30:48,724 --> 00:30:53,149
Jouni, you have been
in your own world recently.

246
00:30:54,062 --> 00:30:56,388
What do you mean?

247
00:30:57,149 --> 00:31:00,696
You haven't mown the lawn
or chopped firewood.

248
00:31:02,029 --> 00:31:04,532
And you should clean your room.

249
00:31:05,949 --> 00:31:10,125
This morning,
you didn't ﬂush the toilet.

250
00:31:11,371 --> 00:31:16,710
Shorry.
- Here's a cucumber sandwich.

251
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:21,842
Thanksh.
- Don't watch films all day.

252
00:31:24,259 --> 00:31:26,929
What is this movie called?

253
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:11,467
Jouni is calling. Antti.

254
00:32:11,557 --> 00:32:13,882
<i>Where are you?
-On the beach.</i>

255
00:32:13,976 --> 00:32:17,642
<i>Immediately to the Shkull Cave.
-But</i> I <i>haven't swum yet.</i>

256
00:32:17,771 --> 00:32:20,785
Okay. To the Skull Cave.

257
00:32:20,858 --> 00:32:23,326
I haven't swum yet.
- Now.

258
00:32:42,379 --> 00:32:45,048
Boysh, do you know what these are?

259
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:48,338
Rishto.
- They look like suction caps.

260
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:54,466
Me and jarmo will climb onto the roof
ushing shuction cupsh.

261
00:32:55,684 --> 00:32:59,896
Seems quite difficult.
- What do you mean "difficult"?

262
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:04,810
The wall is not smooth.
The suction cups won't work.

263
00:33:05,444 --> 00:33:08,457
<i>They don't adhere
to a porous surface.</i>

264
00:33:10,741 --> 00:33:13,315
<i>Bugger. Ish that she?</i>

265
00:33:15,287 --> 00:33:20,092
jarmo, why are you naked?
- I left my swimming trunks at home.

266
00:33:20,209 --> 00:33:25,037
But why are you naked?
- I told him to swim in his underwear.

267
00:33:25,172 --> 00:33:28,019
He didn't have any,
so he swam in his shorts.

268
00:33:28,175 --> 00:33:32,565
The shorts came off because
the elastic band was too loose -

269
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:35,254
and he had his keys in his pocket.

270
00:33:35,349 --> 00:33:39,110
Why are you jumping, jarmo?
- I have water in my ear.

271
00:33:41,355 --> 00:33:44,202
Blimey, jarmo is jumping.

272
00:33:45,192 --> 00:33:50,246
So?
- It's whatchamacallit... Parkour!

273
00:33:50,447 --> 00:33:53,485
What's that?
-It's city jumping.

274
00:33:53,617 --> 00:33:57,034
You've seen <i>it in</i> Casino Royale.

275
00:33:57,204 --> 00:34:00,835
<i>I'm going to jump like a brown hare
onto the tin roof.</i>

276
00:34:00,999 --> 00:34:04,167
<i>Then I'll throw a rope to jarmo.</i>

277
00:34:04,336 --> 00:34:09,141
jarmo is not able to climb the wall.
- He's going to climb the wall.

278
00:34:12,594 --> 00:34:15,382
Now my ear is empty.

279
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:21,527
<i>We'll cut a hole in the tin roof with
a shide grinder and lower me inshide.</i>

280
00:34:21,728 --> 00:34:26,533
How do you get electricity?
- Good point. Let me think.

281
00:34:26,733 --> 00:34:31,871
We can borrow my dad's generator.
- We'll use a generator.

282
00:34:32,948 --> 00:34:36,235
<i>Then we can ushe the grinder-</i>

283
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:40,290
<i>to cut a hole for me.</i>

284
00:34:46,086 --> 00:34:49,788
<i>The ceiling is
a piece of cake for me.</i>

285
00:34:50,257 --> 00:34:53,840
Then I'll lower myself
into jushtiina's shop.

286
00:34:57,264 --> 00:35:01,179
But you said that there are
two surveillance cameras.

287
00:35:01,727 --> 00:35:04,859
Bugger. That's a good point.

288
00:35:05,981 --> 00:35:08,769
What are we going to do now?

289
00:35:09,526 --> 00:35:13,157
When are we going to go
to the shop dressed as the Amish?

290
00:35:13,238 --> 00:35:16,940
Go swimming.
Fish out Jarmo's shorts -

291
00:35:17,075 --> 00:35:19,745
and the Shkull Cave's shpare key.

292
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:23,785
Happy Birthday, Jouni.
Have some cake.

293
00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:26,384
Sit down. I'll take a picture.

294
00:35:26,502 --> 00:35:31,888
49 years. when you turn fifty,
we'll cut those sideburns.

295
00:35:32,799 --> 00:35:35,967
No way. I'd look stupid.

296
00:35:42,267 --> 00:35:43,809
<i>Mat“.
-Where are you?</i>

297
00:35:43,894 --> 00:35:47,406
We're driving dougnuts.
-To the Shkull <i>Cave.</i>

298
00:35:47,523 --> 00:35:51,473
But I haven't driven the lawnmower.
- Now!

299
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:53,449
Okay.)'-

300
00:35:54,404 --> 00:35:56,813
To the Skull Cave!

301
00:36:01,453 --> 00:36:04,491
Rishto,
you'll go to Jushtiina's shop-

302
00:36:04,748 --> 00:36:09,577
<i>and take a photo of the area where
the shurveillance camera ish pointed.</i>

303
00:36:10,587 --> 00:36:12,806
The camera records in B & W -

304
00:36:12,923 --> 00:36:17,503
<i>so you musht develop a B & W photo
in a dark room.</i>

305
00:36:17,594 --> 00:36:19,979
Then you'll build a mount-

306
00:36:20,097 --> 00:36:25,863
and shecretly hang your photograph -

307
00:36:25,978 --> 00:36:31,435
<i>in front of the shurveillance camera.</i>

308
00:36:32,693 --> 00:36:36,988
But I haven't got a camera.
And how do we find a dark room?

309
00:36:38,991 --> 00:36:43,250
Why are you like that?
Don't be like that!

310
00:36:43,745 --> 00:36:46,759
We'll fool the shurveillance camera -

311
00:36:46,915 --> 00:36:50,048
sho that I can be lowered
into the store.

312
00:36:50,169 --> 00:36:53,930
But what if the security guard
is in the shop?

313
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:58,592
What then?
- What are we going to do now?

314
00:37:04,141 --> 00:37:08,436
Pentti, Antti, Rishto and jarmo,
why are you messhing with me?

315
00:37:08,604 --> 00:37:13,112
Jouni, you are messing with us.
- Pentti is right.

316
00:37:13,275 --> 00:37:17,356
You have a short fuse.
- A short fushe!

317
00:37:19,406 --> 00:37:24,330
Fushe... I figured out how to
get rid of the shecurity guard.

318
00:37:24,453 --> 00:37:27,799
Pentti, you know how to weld.
- Yeah.

319
00:37:28,624 --> 00:37:33,132
Your mother is coming, Jouni.
Terttu is coming.

320
00:37:37,132 --> 00:37:39,980
I brought you
marble cake and squash.

321
00:37:42,721 --> 00:37:45,225
What are you planning, boys?

322
00:37:45,933 --> 00:37:50,572
Are you up to your tricks again?
- Of course not.

323
00:37:50,729 --> 00:37:53,114
You're such nice boys.

324
00:37:53,899 --> 00:37:58,408
Goodbye.
- Thanks for the cake, Terttu.

325
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:00,955
Thanks.
- Thanks, Terttu.

326
00:38:01,532 --> 00:38:05,293
Pentti, you can weld the shop's
back door shut.

327
00:38:06,703 --> 00:38:12,291
<i>The shecurity guard can't get in
becaushe the door is welded shut</i> -

328
00:38:12,376 --> 00:38:14,037
<i>and he goesh home.</i>

329
00:38:14,211 --> 00:38:20,546
And then I can get inshide
jushtiina's village shop.

330
00:38:21,009 --> 00:38:25,470
<i>You haven't taken into account
that Justiina might be in her shop.</i>

331
00:38:30,269 --> 00:38:31,301
Shit.

332
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,525
<i>Jouni!
-Yea h?</i>

333
00:38:33,647 --> 00:38:37,527
<i>Your egg sandwich is on the table.
Good night.</i>

334
00:38:38,527 --> 00:38:42,039
<i>What are you watching?
- All the Batmanfilmsh.</i>

335
00:38:47,202 --> 00:38:51,378
It's Jouni. Antti.
- Where are you?

336
00:38:51,498 --> 00:38:54,785
I'm at home, in bed.
- To the Shkull Cave!

337
00:38:58,213 --> 00:39:02,294
What about Rishto, Pentti and jarmo?
- They're not coming.

338
00:39:02,467 --> 00:39:06,015
They said they no longer
want to be involved.

339
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:08,339
Why not?

340
00:39:08,932 --> 00:39:13,737
Pentti doesn't want to borrow
his dad's generator all the time.

341
00:39:14,563 --> 00:39:19,641
Jarmo is afraid of the side grinder
and the dark room confuses Risto.

342
00:39:20,777 --> 00:39:25,831
Then they said you boss around
and don't listen to their ideas.

343
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:29,359
But they don't have any ideas.

344
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:32,704
Risto meant that if they had ideas.

345
00:39:36,126 --> 00:39:39,080
What about you?
- I have nothing else.

346
00:39:40,714 --> 00:39:42,850
Jouni?
- What?

347
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,960
What does "Amish" mean?

348
00:40:10,494 --> 00:40:12,748
Come here, boysh.

349
00:40:14,748 --> 00:40:18,794
<i>“Mo, do you know 'aha
Tupshu shim about yen'!?</i>

350
00:40:19,127 --> 00:40:22,414
No.
- She shaid that you're shtupid.

351
00:40:22,881 --> 00:40:24,851
That's right.

352
00:40:25,259 --> 00:40:31,131
Guess what she shaid about you,
Rishto? She shaid you're a virgin.

353
00:40:31,723 --> 00:40:33,764
That's right.

354
00:40:34,476 --> 00:40:37,739
Guess what she shaid about you,
Pentti?

355
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:42,619
She shaid that you're
a four-eyed fatsho.

356
00:40:42,776 --> 00:40:47,486
Really?
-justiina made fun of our rides.

357
00:40:47,656 --> 00:40:52,081
What? That's a bit rich!
These aren't even finished yet.

358
00:40:52,452 --> 00:40:55,905
<i>Hum 'x .
' “M- Mn“.!</i>

359
00:41:11,054 --> 00:41:16,014
<i>1 want to be Shteven Sheagal
-1 want to be Steven Seagal</i>

360
00:41:16,143 --> 00:41:20,972
<i>I don't want to be Richard Gere
-1 don't want to be Richard Gere</i>

361
00:41:21,106 --> 00:41:26,184
<i>1 want to be Schwarzenegger
-I want to be Schwarzenegger</i>

362
00:41:26,278 --> 00:41:30,739
<i>who wantsh to be Hugh Grant?
-Nobody! Nobody!</i>

363
00:41:31,783 --> 00:41:34,501
You know that
justiina is talking crap.

364
00:41:34,578 --> 00:41:37,247
I'm pretty sure
that I'm not a virgin.

365
00:41:37,706 --> 00:41:40,340
And Pentti is not fat.
He is just heavy.

366
00:41:41,001 --> 00:41:44,881
When we have robbed
jushtiina's shop-

367
00:41:44,963 --> 00:41:48,629
jushtiina's and Tupshu's livesh
will go down the drain.

368
00:41:48,717 --> 00:41:52,977
They'll have to file for pershonal
bankruptcy. They'll be poor.

369
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:59,447
And they will both be
begging ush for shex.

370
00:42:03,315 --> 00:42:05,949
Yes, where wash I?

371
00:42:06,193 --> 00:42:10,737
We have eliminated the camerash,
out-faxed the shecurity guard -

372
00:42:11,323 --> 00:42:15,903
and now I can once again
lower myself into jushtiina's shop.

373
00:42:16,078 --> 00:42:19,530
Jouni...
- What ish it?

374
00:42:19,623 --> 00:42:23,764
What about Justiina and Tupsu?
They're in the shop.

375
00:42:23,877 --> 00:42:28,208
Pentti, the answer is Antti.
- Antti?

376
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:30,250
Antti.
- What?

377
00:42:30,634 --> 00:42:35,688
<i>We 'll shpray Antti with self-tanning
lotion and greashe him up.</i>

378
00:42:35,806 --> 00:42:38,440
He'll be our decoy.
- What does it mean?

379
00:42:38,642 --> 00:42:40,932
A shtool pigeon.

380
00:42:41,019 --> 00:42:44,686
<i>While Antti flexes his musclesh
like Schwarzenegger-</i>

381
00:42:44,773 --> 00:42:48,534
I'm going to rob Jushtiina's shop.

382
00:42:48,861 --> 00:42:54,627
Any questionsh?
- Sounds good.

383
00:42:56,994 --> 00:43:01,573
Here are your costumes
for the youth society's masked ball.

384
00:43:01,665 --> 00:43:04,382
I don't want to go
to a masked ball.

385
00:43:04,501 --> 00:43:08,167
You're going.
These are our costumes.

386
00:43:09,923 --> 00:43:14,004
Oh, that's right.
- But they're not black.

387
00:43:14,094 --> 00:43:17,108
I think black
is such a depressing colour.

388
00:43:17,222 --> 00:43:20,853
And what colour did you ushe?
- Different colours.

389
00:43:24,271 --> 00:43:28,945
Bloody hell.
I guess we'll have to wear these.

390
00:43:44,917 --> 00:43:47,385
Now it begins.

391
00:43:47,961 --> 00:43:54,297
Antti, have I been all keyed up?
- It's nothing. Don't worry.

392
00:43:54,384 --> 00:43:58,051
Jouni, what are we going to do?
- Don't ashk me.

393
00:43:58,222 --> 00:44:00,606
Antti?

394
00:44:01,099 --> 00:44:03,769
Men, attack!

395
00:44:16,657 --> 00:44:21,236
Kalle, is the drummer and his band
Cobra still living in the villa?

396
00:44:21,411 --> 00:44:25,552
No, they're on tour, in Germany.

397
00:44:26,083 --> 00:44:29,500
When will I get the Excalibur poster?

398
00:44:29,628 --> 00:44:33,140
It's on its way.
just a little longer.

399
00:44:33,882 --> 00:44:37,892
Julle, how is The Sensationalist
involved in the marketing?

400
00:44:38,095 --> 00:44:41,761
I've been thinking about
a hunting trip.

401
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:45,307
Let's go and shoot
a shitload of bears.

402
00:44:45,811 --> 00:44:50,319
We can do a story about the makers of
Excalibur hunting bears.

403
00:44:54,069 --> 00:44:58,210
Pentti! Oh my God!
- Do you see that?

404
00:44:58,657 --> 00:45:03,118
What the helvete?
- What is this circus?

405
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:06,748
Wait a moment.
I'll take some pictures.

406
00:45:07,666 --> 00:45:13,289
Erkki "Slop Bucket" Sysimetsä,
this is how we sell magazines.

407
00:45:13,463 --> 00:45:16,667
Beginner's luck.
You just happened to be there.

408
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,683
Don't you get smart with me.

409
00:45:19,928 --> 00:45:25,267
You're writing stories about
Keijo-Sinikka's summer cottage.

410
00:45:25,726 --> 00:45:29,866
Sinikka has a gold record.
- In the seventies, Sysimetsä!

411
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:33,397
1973.
-You write too much.

412
00:45:33,483 --> 00:45:37,992
People want pictures. Here are some
pictures. Look and learn.

413
00:45:38,655 --> 00:45:42,796
This arsehole is Antti Peräkorpi.
He was flexing his muscles -

414
00:45:42,868 --> 00:45:45,158
to lure the shop assistants out.

415
00:45:45,329 --> 00:45:50,157
This is Pentti Alakarvasto. He was
supposed to weld the back door shut -

416
00:45:50,292 --> 00:45:53,460
but a spark lit him up.

417
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:55,510
This is Risto Näre.

418
00:45:55,672 --> 00:46:00,750
He was supposed to fool the
surveillance camera with a photo.

419
00:46:00,969 --> 00:46:05,774
This is jarmo Komulainen. They
managed to cut a hole in the roof -

420
00:46:05,933 --> 00:46:08,092
but Komulainen got stuck.

421
00:46:08,393 --> 00:46:12,569
This guy is
the "brains" of the outfit.

422
00:46:12,689 --> 00:46:18,313
Jouni Hirvi had a panic attack
and cried for his mummy in a ditch.

423
00:46:18,487 --> 00:46:21,524
I got the best material -

424
00:46:21,823 --> 00:46:24,671
when the shopkeeper
justiina found out-

425
00:46:24,785 --> 00:46:27,739
that these nitwits
tried to rob her shop.

426
00:46:27,913 --> 00:46:33,964
Look at this shit.
I just had to start shooting video.

427
00:46:34,253 --> 00:46:37,290
The images are moving.
- This is a YouTube hit.

428
00:46:37,464 --> 00:46:42,767
What will happen to those guys?
will they do time?

429
00:46:42,886 --> 00:46:46,552
No, every talk show
wants to have them.

430
00:46:46,682 --> 00:46:51,676
They'll be touring in a helicopter
and releasing records and books.

431
00:46:51,854 --> 00:46:56,658
Jouni got excited when he heard that
they're making a film based on them.

432
00:46:56,733 --> 00:47:00,435
You're fired!
Stide, is the fake tits here?

433
00:47:00,529 --> 00:47:02,783
What?
- Is the fake tits here?

434
00:47:02,948 --> 00:47:06,045
There she is. Where's Thomas?
- Julle.

435
00:47:06,535 --> 00:47:11,779
There's a slight problem with my
costume. I don't have the sword...

436
00:47:11,915 --> 00:47:15,617
Kalle!
- <i>Vad</i> is it?

437
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:19,662
Stide is going to take pictures
of fake tits and Thomas.

438
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:24,349
Then Stide will send them to me
and I will publish them.

439
00:47:24,469 --> 00:47:27,353
Okay. Go, go, go.

440
00:47:30,475 --> 00:47:34,355
Did you say that I'm fired?

441
00:47:36,815 --> 00:47:42,747
Listen to me, Julle. I began to write
for The Sensationalist in the '60s...

442
00:47:42,863 --> 00:47:45,651
Shut up. You're fired.

443
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,952
Now! Get the fuck out of here.

444
00:47:49,161 --> 00:47:51,569
Get out of this building.

445
00:48:12,643 --> 00:48:15,929
Listen... Hey, listen!

446
00:48:16,688 --> 00:48:21,742
Do you remember...
of course not.

447
00:48:23,195 --> 00:48:28,332
But listen... One sunny morning,
about fifty years ago -

448
00:48:28,492 --> 00:48:34,115
I was on my way to The Sensationalist
offices for the very first time.

449
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:39,049
<i>It was spring.
The air was oozing with eroticism.</i>

450
00:48:42,339 --> 00:48:45,626
<i>Urpo Lehtinen
was the editor-in-chief.</i>

451
00:48:45,843 --> 00:48:49,544
<i>He gave me the nickname
"Slop Bucket'.</i>

452
00:48:49,888 --> 00:48:55,191
<i>Urpo told me to write a feature
about the sinful Finnish summer.</i>

453
00:48:57,437 --> 00:49:00,985
<i>At the same time,
organ repairman Arvo Hakala -</i>

454
00:49:01,066 --> 00:49:04,827
<i>was leaving his dog
with his neighbour for the summer.</i>

455
00:49:04,945 --> 00:49:07,982
Thank you, Alma.
Have a nice summer.

456
00:49:08,115 --> 00:49:11,947
Arvo, try to leave the ladies alone.

457
00:49:12,369 --> 00:49:15,572
Otherwise, there'll be hell to pay.
- Of course.

458
00:49:15,789 --> 00:49:17,949
Bye.
- Bye.

459
00:49:18,166 --> 00:49:21,263
Well, hello Seija.

460
00:49:21,879 --> 00:49:25,046
You're still delivering the post.

461
00:49:39,104 --> 00:49:43,019
What is our route?
- First to Alahärmä. A tuning job.

462
00:49:43,984 --> 00:49:46,997
Then to Ylihärmä'.
An organ needs servicing.

463
00:49:47,154 --> 00:49:52,777
The B-foot and 16-foot pipe valves
are stuck -

464
00:49:52,910 --> 00:49:55,698
and the woodpipes are clogged up.

465
00:49:55,871 --> 00:49:58,825
There's a full renovation job
in Köyrä.

466
00:50:00,792 --> 00:50:05,752
In Köyrä...
we've never been to Köyrä.

467
00:50:05,881 --> 00:50:09,891
First we'll take a pump organ
to Nurmo.

468
00:50:10,719 --> 00:50:13,756
To Nurmo? The school of Ala-Yrvä?

469
00:50:14,515 --> 00:50:16,733
Helena is there.
- Yes, she is.

470
00:50:36,954 --> 00:50:43,764
<i>Each tiny floweret whispers
the great life-givers name</i>

471
00:50:44,294 --> 00:50:47,082
I have brought you an organ.

472
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:52,668
Thank you, children.
You can go home already.

473
00:50:52,928 --> 00:50:57,187
I have other things to do.

474
00:50:57,391 --> 00:51:02,220
It's wonderful that you're here.
But what if the headmaster comes?

475
00:51:02,396 --> 00:51:07,284
Helena, it's been an eternity
since I last kissed your lips -

476
00:51:07,818 --> 00:51:10,452
felt your sensitive bosom -

477
00:51:10,529 --> 00:51:14,112
and caressed
the soft skin of your buttocks.

478
00:51:19,246 --> 00:51:23,078
It's not the headmaster
who will come soon.

479
00:51:44,188 --> 00:51:46,513
Helena?

480
00:51:46,690 --> 00:51:50,487
<i>The pump</i> organ is <i>working now.
- Thank you, Yrjö'.</i>

481
00:51:50,694 --> 00:51:53,198
Thank you.
- Yrjö

482
00:51:53,363 --> 00:51:55,582
<i>Yes'!
-This will take a moment.</i>

483
00:51:56,033 --> 00:51:58,821
Okay, I'll wait for you in the car.

484
00:52:00,495 --> 00:52:02,750
Helena?
- Yes?

485
00:52:02,873 --> 00:52:05,827
Have a nice summer.
-Likewise.

486
00:52:19,598 --> 00:52:22,730
Where are you, Helena?

487
00:52:26,271 --> 00:52:30,103
Our pump organ
has been serviced.

488
00:52:30,526 --> 00:52:33,373
I must pump it immediately.

489
00:52:35,364 --> 00:52:38,710
What is that sound
coming from the map room?

490
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:45,288
Helena? Is something wrong?

491
00:52:55,384 --> 00:52:58,231
What a sight.

492
00:53:10,357 --> 00:53:15,744
Crikey, the pump organ repairman is
pumping Helena with his organ.

493
00:53:21,702 --> 00:53:24,549
It's as thick as a yardstick.

494
00:53:27,374 --> 00:53:30,411
Get a grip, Isotalo.

495
00:53:50,689 --> 00:53:54,035
<i>And so went the summer.</i>

496
00:53:54,193 --> 00:53:56,233
<i>Yrjö' drove the car -</i>

497
00:53:56,403 --> 00:54:00,449
<i>and Arvo drove women crazy.</i>

498
00:54:07,789 --> 00:54:10,578
Hello. Is something wrong?

499
00:54:11,001 --> 00:54:15,889
Hello. We have a flat tyre.
Do you happen to have a jack?

500
00:54:16,173 --> 00:54:20,219
Sure, we have a jack for you.

501
00:54:22,804 --> 00:54:26,945
I wonder if there are any
raspberries in the bushes?

502
00:54:27,809 --> 00:54:31,855
Let's check it out.
- Yes.

503
00:54:34,983 --> 00:54:38,116
I'm Wolf Scout leader
Peter Ramfeld.

504
00:54:38,278 --> 00:54:41,826
Heidi is a Bunny Scout leader
from Munkkiniemi.

505
00:54:42,658 --> 00:54:46,798
We were on our way to a jamboree,
when our tyre blew out.

506
00:54:47,663 --> 00:54:52,242
I'm a knot course instructor and
Heidi is running a first aid course.

507
00:54:54,461 --> 00:54:58,412
I might get to go to sauna
with Heidi tonight.

508
00:55:01,093 --> 00:55:04,759
What was that?
A badger? A pine marten?

509
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:08,311
Sounds like it.
- That's not a pine marten.

510
00:55:08,517 --> 00:55:12,812
Maybe it's a rutting badger.
- That's not a badger.

511
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:18,223
Was that all?
- Yes. Thanks for the help.

512
00:55:20,279 --> 00:55:23,233
Everyone's happy now.

513
00:55:24,408 --> 00:55:26,567
Get in the car, Heidi.

514
00:55:32,291 --> 00:55:34,699
Okay then...

515
00:55:37,421 --> 00:55:41,881
I had trouble writing my story -

516
00:55:42,050 --> 00:55:45,930
because I had been on a bender
the whole summer.

517
00:55:46,430 --> 00:55:51,389
I had been travelling around Finland
on The Sensationalist's tab -

518
00:55:51,602 --> 00:55:56,406
<i>and was stuck in a motel
somewhere in Northern Ostrobothnia.</i>

519
00:55:56,481 --> 00:55:59,115
<i>But one evening,
the action picked up.</i>

520
00:55:59,318 --> 00:56:04,455
<i>Two organ repairmen came in,
Yrjö Kortesmäki -</i>

521
00:56:04,573 --> 00:56:08,204
<i>and Arvo Hakala,
who was a superstud.</i>

522
00:56:12,539 --> 00:56:17,997
<i>Half an hour later, and the waitress
was ready and willing.</i>

523
00:56:19,755 --> 00:56:24,928
I never figured out why women
were interested in Hakala -

524
00:56:25,052 --> 00:56:28,338
<i>but the waitress was like putty
in his hands.</i>

525
00:56:28,472 --> 00:56:32,862
His singing sends butterflies
to my stomach.

526
00:56:39,399 --> 00:56:42,152
Oh dear me...
- What is it?

527
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:44,787
Well...

528
00:56:45,072 --> 00:56:48,453
Do you have fresh towels
in your room?

529
00:56:49,368 --> 00:56:52,037
Let's go and check it out.

530
00:56:59,336 --> 00:57:01,211
Oh yes!

531
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:03,954
<i>Hakala': downfall was the fact -</i>

532
00:57:04,132 --> 00:57:09,649
<i>that this world is full of
jealous and vengeful men.</i>

533
00:57:10,848 --> 00:57:14,134
Your friend is quite the ladies' man.

534
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:17,777
Well, I don't know about that.

535
00:57:18,397 --> 00:57:23,107
We're organ repairmen.
We're just doing our job.

536
00:57:23,235 --> 00:57:28,752
<i>Yrjö' was a novice drinker,
so I started buying him drinks -</i>

537
00:57:28,866 --> 00:57:34,703
<i>and pumping him for information
on Hakala's female encounters.</i>

538
00:57:35,205 --> 00:57:40,912
<i>1 realised that this is the story
I'd been looking for.</i>

539
00:57:41,295 --> 00:57:45,803
"Superstud took the waitress'
hand and guided her to the stairs -

540
00:57:45,883 --> 00:57:48,671
leading to a sinful motel room."

541
00:57:48,886 --> 00:57:54,023
"The waitress felt hot and cold
waves going through her..."

542
00:57:57,603 --> 00:57:59,928
"ﬂ-body-n

543
00:58:08,739 --> 00:58:13,069
I have a sensational story for you.
I'm sending it right away.

544
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:23,665
Don't puke on the ﬂoor!
- I didn't do it on purpose.

545
00:58:24,963 --> 00:58:29,887
I'm sorry.
- I'm sending you a bill.

546
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:33,557
How can I contact you?
- Call me on the porcelain phone.

547
00:58:33,639 --> 00:58:37,186
Where's Raili?
- She's taking a shower.

548
00:58:37,309 --> 00:58:40,062
Shit!
- What's wrong, Yrjö?

549
00:58:41,355 --> 00:58:44,143
Should I drive today?
- Gentlemen...

550
00:58:44,358 --> 00:58:48,498
where are you headed?
- To Köyrä', I think.

551
00:58:49,321 --> 00:58:53,331
To Köyrä? I'm going there, too.

552
00:58:55,911 --> 00:58:58,794
Can I tag along?

553
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:03,180
Life on the road
must be quite wild.

554
00:59:03,919 --> 00:59:07,336
Well, all kinds of things happen
along the way.

555
00:59:08,382 --> 00:59:12,842
My life's not always this wild.
- I can believe that.

556
00:59:14,346 --> 00:59:22,473
<i>I was so smitten
but you gave me the mitten</i>

557
00:59:22,813 --> 00:59:30,477
<i>La la la la la la,
why did you make a fool out of me?</i>

558
00:59:31,321 --> 00:59:34,952
The organ repairmen, I presume.
Welcome to Köyrä.

559
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:40,124
Our organ is in need of service.
I'm cantor Sakari Res.

560
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:50,880
Well, well, well.
We have never serviced this organ.

561
00:59:51,049 --> 00:59:53,719
The vicar has been stingy-

562
00:59:53,969 --> 00:59:58,394
but soon our organ will be clean as
a whistle. It's a lead-pipe cinch!

563
01:00:00,267 --> 01:00:04,478
How come every other
pedalboard key is broken?

564
01:00:04,646 --> 01:00:10,329
There's a big wedding coming up.
I'll be going up the aisle -

565
01:00:10,402 --> 01:00:12,870
with a beautiful woman.

566
01:00:16,158 --> 01:00:19,112
You're getting married?
Congratulations.

567
01:00:19,244 --> 01:00:21,214
I do!

568
01:00:25,626 --> 01:00:28,295
I'm playing my trouser trumpet.

569
01:00:46,396 --> 01:00:50,157
I'm the vicar of this parish.
Rauno Ylämäki.

570
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:53,414
Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

571
01:00:53,862 --> 01:00:58,406
Are the organ repairmen
busy at work?

572
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:01,085
Yes, they're tuning the organ.

573
01:01:01,203 --> 01:01:06,411
Go tell them that there's a lunch
waiting at the vicarage.

574
01:01:06,583 --> 01:01:10,759
Elk soup.
- Thanks for the invite.

575
01:01:10,921 --> 01:01:17,731
What the hell? Your Camionnette's
radiator is leaking.

576
01:01:19,179 --> 01:01:24,352
I'm not a big fan of organ music.

577
01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:29,699
Our Sakari is such a bad
organ player-

578
01:01:29,815 --> 01:01:33,695
that he can barely play any hymns -

579
01:01:34,403 --> 01:01:37,250
let alone Christmas songs.

580
01:01:43,662 --> 01:01:50,543
Okay, that's enough. But now our
organ will be ready for the wedding.

581
01:01:50,711 --> 01:01:54,756
An esteemed cantor
is coming from Nurmo.

582
01:01:54,923 --> 01:01:58,506
He knows all the wedding marches
by heart.

583
01:02:00,179 --> 01:02:02,812
Sakari told us about the wedding.

584
01:02:02,931 --> 01:02:06,763
That's right.
And it's going to be a big wedding.

585
01:02:07,352 --> 01:02:12,561
My daughter Susanna and Sakari
are getting married.

586
01:02:12,774 --> 01:02:17,319
They're going to love each other
till death does them part.

587
01:02:21,909 --> 01:02:23,819
That was a good one!

588
01:02:25,329 --> 01:02:29,789
Whoever is holding a fart,
is keeping a secret.

589
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,176
And if shit doesn't stink,
it's gone bad!

590
01:02:37,841 --> 01:02:43,429
<i>Ben appétit!
-The vicarage was a madhouse.</i>

591
01:02:43,722 --> 01:02:46,439
We spent weeks in Köyrä.

592
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:51,274
The cantor had completely crushed
the organ.

593
01:02:57,736 --> 01:03:00,619
That'll do!

594
01:03:07,079 --> 01:03:09,404
<i>Yrjö and Arvo beavered away.</i>

595
01:03:09,581 --> 01:03:12,998
<i>I must say,
they were true professionals.</i>

596
01:03:15,128 --> 01:03:16,849
A little too high.

597
01:03:17,005 --> 01:03:19,888
<i>They were staying
in the vicarage granary.</i>

598
01:03:20,008 --> 01:03:26,130
<i>They slept all night
and worked all day.</i>

599
01:03:27,558 --> 01:03:28,839
Oh yeah.

600
01:03:28,976 --> 01:03:32,428
<i>I decided to observe
how the situation would unfold.</i>

601
01:03:32,521 --> 01:03:34,680
<i>I lied to the vicar-</i>

602
01:03:34,815 --> 01:03:37,947
<i>that I was a poet
who needed a workroom.</i>

603
01:03:38,193 --> 01:03:41,231
I'm a poet who needs a workroom.

604
01:03:41,363 --> 01:03:45,872
There's always room for a poet
in our granary.

605
01:03:46,076 --> 01:03:48,212
I know a poem.

606
01:03:49,037 --> 01:03:53,498
<i>I was just fifteen
when I took my grandfather's life</i>

607
01:03:53,709 --> 01:03:58,099
<i>I taught him a lesson
by tickling his ribs with my knife</i>

608
01:04:00,757 --> 01:04:04,637
<i>I wrote my best work
in that granary.</i>

609
01:04:04,970 --> 01:04:08,067
<i>"Finland's sinful summer",
"Superstud" -</i>

610
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:12,280
<i>"Superstud and the three tarts '1
"Superstud sows his seeds</i> ” -

611
01:04:12,394 --> 01:04:16,226
<i>"The return of Superstud",
"Superstud rides again" -</i>

612
01:04:16,315 --> 01:04:20,325
<i>"who is Superstud?'
and 'This is Superstud".</i>

613
01:04:22,237 --> 01:04:28,917
Those magazines sold like hot cakes,
and I got my nickname, "Slop Bucket".

614
01:04:29,203 --> 01:04:32,904
But then the story
took an unexpected turn.

615
01:04:33,165 --> 01:04:39,287
<i>Arvo was a restless man.
He couldn't sleep.</i>

616
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:41,102
Good evening.
- Good evening to you, too.

617
01:05:42,484 --> 01:05:46,945
You play the saw beautifully.
Fancy a walk this night?

618
01:05:50,534 --> 01:05:53,820
I don't want to marry
that farting ogre.

619
01:05:55,289 --> 01:05:59,749
He behaves like a pig.
And my father just laughs.

620
01:06:00,627 --> 01:06:03,724
He thinks that Sakari is a funny guy.

621
01:06:03,797 --> 01:06:06,466
You cannot force love to happen.

622
01:06:13,473 --> 01:06:14,814
I want to run away.

623
01:06:14,933 --> 01:06:18,849
Arvo, it is a new work day.

624
01:06:20,272 --> 01:06:23,190
Today, we're going to polish
organ pipes.

625
01:06:28,447 --> 01:06:30,286
Arvo?

626
01:06:33,410 --> 01:06:35,700
Is Arvo here?

627
01:06:42,628 --> 01:06:44,763
Goddamn...

628
01:06:48,008 --> 01:06:50,013
THIS IS SUPERSTUD

629
01:06:50,219 --> 01:06:52,758
Fucking hell!

630
01:06:56,517 --> 01:06:57,763
YOU rat!

631
01:06:58,143 --> 01:07:03,387
Hello? This is headmaster Isotalo.

632
01:07:03,857 --> 01:07:09,315
I have a question.
- Ask away.

633
01:07:09,446 --> 01:07:17,075
Is an organ repairman named
Arvo Hakala repairing your organ?

634
01:07:18,288 --> 01:07:19,914
Well... yes.

635
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:25,332
Do you read magazines?

636
01:07:25,671 --> 01:07:29,966
Let's cut his balls off-

637
01:07:30,092 --> 01:07:36,024
with a rusty fighting knife.

638
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:41,636
Susanna?

639
01:07:41,937 --> 01:07:44,820
Susanna!

640
01:07:45,816 --> 01:07:47,951
Where is Susanna?
- Susanna!

641
01:07:48,068 --> 01:07:51,414
Who is Susanna?
- Susanna is Susanna!

642
01:07:51,488 --> 01:07:55,913
Susanna!
- I'm going to kill him!

643
01:07:56,118 --> 01:07:59,535
I'm going to kill him!
- Kill! Kill!

644
01:08:03,041 --> 01:08:07,846
Arvo, wake up.
You have to go now.

645
01:08:11,091 --> 01:08:14,437
Susanna, I think I love you.

646
01:08:15,137 --> 01:08:17,806
I love you too, Arvo.

647
01:08:23,437 --> 01:08:26,783
Where is he?
-where is that lothario?

648
01:08:27,357 --> 01:08:29,612
Is he in the cupboard?

649
01:08:30,736 --> 01:08:33,120
I'm going to kill him!

650
01:08:33,405 --> 01:08:40,535
Rauno, do you have heavier weapons
in the attic or under the floor?

651
01:08:45,083 --> 01:08:47,219
I sure do.

652
01:08:57,471 --> 01:08:59,511
Arvo!

653
01:09:04,019 --> 01:09:06,807
What is this commotion?

654
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:14,787
Arvo, you're in trouble.

655
01:09:16,657 --> 01:09:18,733
They're pissed off.

656
01:09:29,628 --> 01:09:32,582
They hit the engine.

657
01:09:38,053 --> 01:09:41,316
Yrjö, thanks for everything.
I'm sorry.

658
01:09:58,282 --> 01:10:03,205
It's time to break out
the heavy artillery.

659
01:10:24,016 --> 01:10:26,804
Sakari, a little to the left.
- What?

660
01:10:26,977 --> 01:10:31,901
Everyone, squeeze up a bit.
Taneli, chin up.

661
01:10:32,524 --> 01:10:35,692
Don't look into the camera.
Say cheese.

662
01:10:36,737 --> 01:10:39,027
Great.

663
01:10:39,573 --> 01:10:41,792
Get the hell out of our way.

664
01:10:41,992 --> 01:10:46,038
Superstud, your game's up.
It's payback time!

665
01:10:46,205 --> 01:10:49,657
Time to meet your maker, lothario!

666
01:10:57,090 --> 01:11:05,146
<i>I was so smitten
but you gave me the mitten</i>

667
01:11:05,641 --> 01:11:13,234
<i>La la la la la la,
why did you make a fool out of me?</i>

668
01:11:50,644 --> 01:11:53,148
Are you happy now?

669
01:12:12,833 --> 01:12:18,634
<i>Arvo Hakala was remembered by
Susanna, Yrjö and Rekku the dog.</i>

670
01:12:19,715 --> 01:12:25,338
<i>Also a multitude of women
paid their respects to a man -</i>

671
01:12:25,512 --> 01:12:29,024
<i>who had brought joy
to their everyday lives.</i>

672
01:12:29,558 --> 01:12:35,395
<i>Ever since the funeral, there have
been fresh ﬂowers on his grave -</i>

673
01:12:35,647 --> 01:12:38,601
<i>and an eternal flame.</i>

674
01:12:39,902 --> 01:12:43,912
That was the beginning of my career,
but it's all over now.

675
01:12:44,156 --> 01:12:48,415
Don't you want to order anything?
- No. I've had enough.

676
01:12:53,749 --> 01:12:56,537
Hey, you forgot your magazines.

677
01:13:06,595 --> 01:13:09,229
INTERNATIONAL FUNDING
FOR EXCALIBUR?

678
01:13:09,681 --> 01:13:13,229
This is sub-par work.
who did the poster?

679
01:13:13,310 --> 01:13:16,762
Me. It's not that bad.

680
01:13:17,731 --> 01:13:22,121
I have to get a couple million.
Otherwise, it's bye-bye life.

681
01:13:22,236 --> 01:13:24,953
Has Make the Millionaire arrived?
- No.

682
01:13:25,072 --> 01:13:28,654
But the room is full of
international sponsors.

683
01:14:33,515 --> 01:14:37,810
Sometimes Igor has a little taster.
How do you say it in English?

684
01:15:36,787 --> 01:15:38,946
Well?

685
01:15:39,164 --> 01:15:43,376
The Americans have left.
They're so rude.

686
01:18:04,726 --> 01:18:09,021
Do you have to talk over it?
Now the Germans have left.

687
01:18:09,189 --> 01:18:13,105
Achtung! Ze programm kontinues.

688
01:18:13,443 --> 01:18:17,454
Lapland! You burned Rovaniemi.

689
01:18:17,948 --> 01:18:22,207
Just to let you know,
Make the Millionaire is now here.

690
01:18:22,369 --> 01:18:25,323
Make is here. Great.
- No, it's not.

691
01:18:38,677 --> 01:18:42,818
What were you saying?
- Make drank three bottles of booze.

692
01:18:42,973 --> 01:18:45,049
He is shitfaced.

693
01:18:49,313 --> 01:18:51,697
Fucking hell.

694
01:18:57,112 --> 01:18:59,366
I have money!

695
01:19:04,286 --> 01:19:07,003
Let's go.
- I'm on the ceiling.

696
01:19:15,923 --> 01:19:18,936
The cannibals
get the shit kicked out of them.

697
01:20:16,441 --> 01:20:20,986
I have a train to catch.

698
01:20:22,865 --> 01:20:27,041
"1 have a train to catch."
Catch that train then!

699
01:20:27,202 --> 01:20:32,446
What about your train? And your bus?
- I have a dentist appointment.

700
01:20:32,624 --> 01:20:37,050
Go catch your trains and buses! Go!
The train is leaving!

701
01:20:37,212 --> 01:20:41,092
Go! All aboard!

702
01:20:45,888 --> 01:20:47,608
What kind of mistake?

703
01:21:10,871 --> 01:21:13,445
<i>Make!
-Yeah?</i>

704
01:21:14,124 --> 01:21:18,419
The Japs say that (Ögil killed
John's father Bill in part II.

705
01:21:18,504 --> 01:21:21,387
<i>(Ögil poisoned him.</i>

706
01:21:22,174 --> 01:21:26,635
why didn't anyone tell me?
- You never ask <i>anything.</i>

707
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:30,430
<i>Dear 3695-"...</i>

708
01:21:50,661 --> 01:21:53,200
It was a great success.

709
01:21:54,748 --> 01:21:58,130
Don't you fucking write about this.
- Of course not.

710
01:21:59,628 --> 01:22:03,638
Kurre. These Japanese gentlemen
have something to say.

711
01:22:09,429 --> 01:22:13,012
Screw <i>Zero, Nagamoto,
hara/rirl} kamikaze</i> and <i>banzai.</i>

712
01:22:39,585 --> 01:22:43,666
Soon we'll be hunting bears!
We're tough as nails!

713
01:22:44,923 --> 01:22:48,020
Hey, try to behave back there.

714
01:22:48,802 --> 01:22:51,306
What the fuck?

715
01:22:51,430 --> 01:22:55,511
We just got 18 million!
Shut the fuck up, you flying monkey!

716
01:22:55,642 --> 01:22:58,988
Don't you know who I am?
john Excalibur!

717
01:22:59,771 --> 01:23:03,153
I don't care! I have money.

718
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:07,541
<i>I have so much money
that even death is funny</i>

719
01:23:07,696 --> 01:23:12,086
<i>I have such an expensive toy
that even death brings me joy</i>

720
01:23:12,284 --> 01:23:14,538
Look at those country bumpkins.

721
01:23:19,249 --> 01:23:22,097
Try to hit them.

722
01:23:27,758 --> 01:23:31,020
Hey, flying monkey, land there.

723
01:23:31,178 --> 01:23:33,313
We're getting out.

724
01:23:33,555 --> 01:23:38,479
This is not your destination.
- Do as Kurre tells you.

725
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:41,479
Land the whirlybird.
- Land the whirlybird.

726
01:23:41,605 --> 01:23:44,358
Land the whirlybird!

727
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:50,205
Daddy! A helo!
The Vietnam War is starting!

728
01:23:50,322 --> 01:23:53,454
Are you okay, boys?
-Jeremias is fine.

729
01:23:53,575 --> 01:23:57,241
Hesekiel is okay. They dropped
a hundred kilos of napalm.

730
01:23:57,329 --> 01:23:59,334
Don't exaggerate.

731
01:23:59,498 --> 01:24:02,844
They're just arrogant arseholes
from Helsinki.

732
01:24:03,126 --> 01:24:05,796
Calm down.

733
01:24:07,422 --> 01:24:11,183
More. A little bit more.
That's good.

734
01:24:15,556 --> 01:24:19,696
Guys, guess what this lake is called?

735
01:24:20,686 --> 01:24:23,094
This is Jordan.

736
01:24:24,731 --> 01:24:28,398
Make, let's booze.

737
01:24:34,032 --> 01:24:37,070
A killer. Don't point it at me.

738
01:24:37,536 --> 01:24:39,612
Good.

739
01:24:41,456 --> 01:24:45,597
This is chamois from
Mount Kilimanjaro. 400 euros a kilo.

740
01:24:45,794 --> 01:24:48,511
I have a hundred kilos
in the freezer.

741
01:24:48,922 --> 01:24:52,873
Tender as fuck.
Marbled chamois.

742
01:24:53,385 --> 01:24:56,968
Let's leave the meat to cook
and shoot some bears.

743
01:24:57,556 --> 01:25:02,230
Take your CB radios.
- Be quiet for a moment.

744
01:25:02,394 --> 01:25:05,846
Shush! Listen.

745
01:25:09,610 --> 01:25:13,121
The wilderness... It's so relaxing!

746
01:25:24,499 --> 01:25:26,540
Where are the bears?

747
01:25:30,005 --> 01:25:33,173
Put the safety on!
- Where is it?

748
01:25:35,385 --> 01:25:38,339
There's something wrong
with my rifle.

749
01:25:40,516 --> 01:25:46,282
A bullet hit momma's jar.
- Esteri, my wife!

750
01:25:47,231 --> 01:25:51,905
Father Isaskar, those townies have
set up camp without permission.

751
01:25:52,110 --> 01:25:56,322
Nobody camps here,
with or without permission.

752
01:25:56,823 --> 01:25:59,920
Calm down, boys.
- But we're already calm.

753
01:25:59,993 --> 01:26:05,297
Yeah, but more.
I'm declaring a holy war.

754
01:26:33,861 --> 01:26:37,277
Metusalem, bury these.

755
01:26:37,656 --> 01:26:42,900
If you live by the elk rifle,
you die by the elk rifle.

756
01:26:43,036 --> 01:26:47,746
It's time to teach these fucktards
a valuable lesson.

757
01:26:49,168 --> 01:26:53,712
Throw them in there.
- Thomas! Korhonen!

758
01:26:54,131 --> 01:26:56,848
Don't move. They'll see you.

759
01:26:57,801 --> 01:27:00,435
There's one of those vermin.

760
01:27:00,596 --> 01:27:05,306
Look.
The townies are surprisingly fast.

761
01:27:06,059 --> 01:27:08,563
Lead it a little.

762
01:27:10,814 --> 01:27:13,068
That's my boy!

763
01:27:13,859 --> 01:27:16,268
Go get the body.

764
01:27:20,699 --> 01:27:23,653
What is this thingy?

765
01:27:27,497 --> 01:27:30,001
Shut

766
01:27:34,254 --> 01:27:36,473
You townie monkey.

767
01:27:52,856 --> 01:27:55,181
Wake up, Make!

768
01:28:02,032 --> 01:28:05,295
Hello? Does anyone hear me? Over.

769
01:28:38,569 --> 01:28:41,665
Hello? Does anyone hear me? Over.

770
01:28:43,323 --> 01:28:46,171
Hello? Does anyone hear me? Over.

771
01:28:47,369 --> 01:28:50,501
<i>Hello. Over.</i>

772
01:28:53,542 --> 01:28:57,208
Hello. Our camp has been destroyed.

773
01:28:57,713 --> 01:29:01,924
Crazy hillbillies are hunting us,
just like in Deliverance.

774
01:29:02,176 --> 01:29:04,501
I want to get the fuck out of here.

775
01:29:10,309 --> 01:29:14,319
<i>Come to the forest road,
and we'll pick you up.</i>

776
01:29:14,479 --> 01:29:18,110
<i>There's no need to use swear words.
Help is on its way.</i>

777
01:29:18,317 --> 01:29:22,113
<i>Thank you and goodbye.</i>
- Bye.

778
01:29:28,535 --> 01:29:31,418
Did someone call for a rescue party?

779
01:29:35,083 --> 01:29:37,658
He's zigzagging.

780
01:29:58,690 --> 01:30:00,850
It's no use.

781
01:30:05,614 --> 01:30:09,529
Kurre?
- Kurre! Over here!

782
01:30:09,826 --> 01:30:12,994
Kom here!
- Great, Kurre!

783
01:30:13,163 --> 01:30:15,323
Open this door.
- Get pliers.

784
01:30:15,499 --> 01:30:18,631
Shut up! You're going to wake them.
- Kurre!

785
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:20,722
Kurre?
- Are you leaving?

786
01:30:20,796 --> 01:30:24,142
Shut up! You're going to wake
the catapult guy up.

787
01:30:24,508 --> 01:30:27,640
This bike has no chain.

788
01:30:30,639 --> 01:30:32,798
<i>Donkey KN“?-!</i>

789
01:30:39,648 --> 01:30:41,487
Kurre!
- Help us!

790
01:30:41,567 --> 01:30:43,726
Kurre!
- Fuck of-f!

791
01:30:52,953 --> 01:30:55,587
Hey, he's Excalibur.

792
01:30:57,833 --> 01:31:01,914
The action man. Come.

793
01:31:02,212 --> 01:31:04,348
Get away! Not you!

794
01:31:08,093 --> 01:31:10,229
I'm going to make it. I'm a star.

795
01:31:19,104 --> 01:31:25,605
Let's watch all the Exralibur films.
Metusalem, bring us some mead.

796
01:31:25,694 --> 01:31:28,233
Mead!
- Mead!

797
01:31:28,405 --> 01:31:31,288
Mead!
- Mead.

798
01:31:32,951 --> 01:31:36,534
What kind of mead?
- Strong mead.

799
01:32:01,688 --> 01:32:05,271
What are we going to watch next?
- Part II.

800
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:09,232
But we just watched it.
- We're watching it again.

801
01:32:12,699 --> 01:32:17,694
You can fly.
- No, not really.

802
01:32:17,829 --> 01:32:20,962
Have a fish.
- It's a stuntman.

803
01:32:22,876 --> 01:32:27,954
<i>You have ﬂown a spaceship.
-Have you seen trolls or orcs?</i>

804
01:32:28,590 --> 01:32:30,975
What?
- Trolls and orcs.

805
01:32:31,093 --> 01:32:34,854
Can you do anything?
Do you know how to fence?

806
01:32:35,389 --> 01:32:38,307
As a matter of fact,
I know how to fence.

807
01:32:38,725 --> 01:32:42,522
You need to know
how to hold a sword.

808
01:32:43,647 --> 01:32:45,557
I see.

809
01:32:48,944 --> 01:32:53,155
Metusalem goes mental
when he grabs a sword.

810
01:32:53,323 --> 01:32:57,998
He's unbeatable.
- He punctured Jeremias' eye.

811
01:32:58,412 --> 01:33:02,991
I recommend a turtle defence,
but I'm afraid it won't save you.

812
01:33:03,083 --> 01:33:06,037
Nothing will save you.
-Break a leg!

813
01:33:06,253 --> 01:33:08,792
Let the tournament begin.

814
01:33:11,175 --> 01:33:16,169
He'd probably need a stuntman.
That's good!

815
01:33:16,930 --> 01:33:21,676
That hit left his head spinning
and ears ringing.

816
01:33:23,228 --> 01:33:25,483
Great!

817
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:33,075
That was a cowardly move.
A kick in the nuts from behind.

818
01:33:33,155 --> 01:33:35,563
His nuts can't take such punishment.

819
01:33:41,788 --> 01:33:44,636
Watch out!
- He's behind you!

820
01:33:47,127 --> 01:33:49,132
Hit him!

821
01:33:49,796 --> 01:33:52,750
Done.
- He's dead.

822
01:34:01,183 --> 01:34:06,640
Thomas is dead.
They killed Thomas!

823
01:34:07,064 --> 01:34:11,524
They'll kill us all.
They're going to lynkka us.

824
01:34:11,777 --> 01:34:13,996
Shit! We're all going to db'.

825
01:34:14,238 --> 01:34:18,153
I didn't want to go
on a hunting trip!

826
01:34:18,283 --> 01:34:22,424
Quit your whining!
-Shut up!

827
01:34:23,288 --> 01:34:30,098
<i>Listen to them.
- Let's rut this off first.</i>

828
01:34:31,380 --> 01:34:35,081
Then we'll stick the knife
into the rectum.

829
01:34:35,300 --> 01:34:41,481
We'll stick the knife deep inside
and slice open the belly.

830
01:34:43,058 --> 01:34:47,638
Like this. And have to be careful
not to burst the gall bladder.

831
01:34:48,188 --> 01:34:53,326
What is that white slime?
- This is a male.

832
01:34:54,236 --> 01:34:56,146
A man.
- It's spunk.

833
01:34:56,280 --> 01:34:58,534
Yes, it's semen.

834
01:34:59,283 --> 01:35:02,545
Give these to the cat.

835
01:35:04,329 --> 01:35:09,253
<i>Vim“.
-Then cut off the head.</i>

836
01:35:09,334 --> 01:35:14,887
They're going to eat us.
They're cannibals.

837
01:35:15,340 --> 01:35:20,145
What about the eyes and the brain?
- This has no brains.

838
01:35:21,430 --> 01:35:27,801
It's time to take you inside.
- Everything's ready.

839
01:35:29,021 --> 01:35:33,600
Everything.
- Forgive me.

840
01:35:35,527 --> 01:35:39,537
You have nothing to fear.
- I love you guys.

841
01:35:46,455 --> 01:35:49,373
Excalibur woke up.

842
01:35:49,666 --> 01:35:52,075
He's a nice guy.

843
01:35:52,252 --> 01:35:56,796
Give me some fish.
Take off your hat.

844
01:35:57,841 --> 01:36:00,001
Korhonen... he's alive.

845
01:36:00,093 --> 01:36:04,305
I have to say
that violence is golden.

846
01:36:22,157 --> 01:36:26,986
Daddy! There are japaneses
in our garden.

847
01:36:36,755 --> 01:36:38,974
It's a Lexus.

848
01:37:36,481 --> 01:37:38,985
What the hell? Where am I?

849
01:37:44,948 --> 01:37:47,108
More violence.

850
01:37:50,662 --> 01:37:55,551
Kurre, I have a horrible hangover.
I need something to drink.

851
01:37:55,834 --> 01:37:59,631
There's some mead.
- Guess how much money I have?

852
01:37:59,922 --> 01:38:02,496
How much?
- I don't know.

853
01:38:03,842 --> 01:38:07,259
<i>We spent another night
at the Toukkas' -</i>

854
01:38:07,471 --> 01:38:10,852
<i>drinking strong mead.</i>

855
01:38:11,141 --> 01:38:14,404
<i>We became best of friends.</i>

856
01:38:14,937 --> 01:38:19,576
<i>we're going to remember this lesson
for the rest of our lives.</i>

857
01:38:20,484 --> 01:38:25,478
<i>Respect your neighbour.
All men are equally worthy.</i>

858
01:38:25,948 --> 01:38:30,207
<i>Wash your hands before meals
and finish your plate.</i>

859
01:38:30,661 --> 01:38:33,378
<i>No singing at the dinner table.</i>

860
01:38:54,935 --> 01:39:00,772
Yes, but I've told you that there
won't be more Excalibur films.

861
01:39:01,108 --> 01:39:04,525
Silence. Rolling.

862
01:39:08,448 --> 01:39:12,031
And action.
- Raspberry fool is a tricky dish.

863
01:39:12,160 --> 01:39:16,171
But you can also use other berries.

864
01:39:16,373 --> 01:39:18,947
Add some sugar.

865
01:39:19,334 --> 01:39:21,802
I'm using potato ﬂour -

866
01:39:22,004 --> 01:39:27,521
but if you can't eat it,
you can use just about anything.

867
01:39:36,310 --> 01:39:41,114
Arvo? Is that you, Arvo Hakala?

868
01:39:42,774 --> 01:39:44,993
Slop Bucket.

869
01:39:51,742 --> 01:39:55,004
How did you get out alive?

870
01:39:58,457 --> 01:40:01,803
There was a cellar
under the floorboards.

871
01:40:02,836 --> 01:40:04,912
Good to hear.

872
01:40:05,422 --> 01:40:10,132
It all worked out in the end.

873
01:40:35,327 --> 01:40:37,901
Last one in the lake is a rotten egg!

874
01:40:44,169 --> 01:40:46,673
Damn, I forgot to take off my watch.

875
01:41:07,860 --> 01:41:12,036
