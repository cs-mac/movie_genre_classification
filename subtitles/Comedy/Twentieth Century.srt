1
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:20,472
But, Daddy, you all know Michael loves me
and I love him.

2
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:23,277
"You can't call that a sin,
his feelings for me."

3
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:25,681
That' s where my brother breaks in,
Mr. Jacobs.

4
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,117
All right, where is Mr. Johnson?

5
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:29,985
- He's outside taking a smoke.
- Joe, go get him, will you?

6
00:01:30,056 --> 00:01:33,184
Everybody be on your toes.
Mr. Jaffe's taking rehearsal today.

7
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:35,193
All right, skip that part, Miss Plotka.

8
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:38,594
Go to the place where you hear your father
has just killed Michael.

9
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:40,132
Come on, make your entrance.

10
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,930
"Mary Jo, where are you all, Mary Jo?"

11
00:01:43,002 --> 00:01:44,128
"What is it, Emmy Lou?"

12
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:46,968
"Your father just met Michael.
He's out there on the lawn."

13
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,735
"Emmy Lou, what are we going to do?"

14
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:51,276
- You hear a shot.
- Two shots, isn't it, Mr. Jacobs?

15
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:52,402
Yes.

16
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:57,345
"Oh, Lordy, Miss Mary Jo.
Your daddy just killed Mr. Michael."

17
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,377
That' s where I scream.

18
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:03,581
There's going to be a lot of screaming
around here, young lady...

19
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:05,385
and it isn't going to be by you, either.

20
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,392
But you said we were just walking through.

21
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,088
- I know we were walking through...
- Max.

22
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:13,161
All right, go ahead, everybody.
Go through it again.

23
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:14,291
"Daddy..."

24
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:17,461
Now that Hoboken Cinderella
isn't going to do.

25
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:20,266
That kind of acting is for pins
in a basement.

26
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,398
You're telling me.

27
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:24,910
She's hopeless, and the worst of it
is that Jaffe's going to blame me...

28
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:28,379
for the fact that a lingerie model
hasn't turned out to be a Bernhardt.

29
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:30,382
The more you direct her, the worse she gets.

30
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,886
Max, which one of these foul guinea hens
is named Lily Garland?

31
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:36,046
Not so loud, Owen.
We're discussing something.

32
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:38,716
Listen, you foul Corsican,
these are orders from on high.

33
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:41,589
I just encountered Mr. Jaffe in the lobby,
all of a twitter.

34
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:42,923
- Is he here?
- Yes, he's here...

35
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:46,159
and he wants her pulsing life story
trumpeted through the press...

36
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:48,462
by tomorrow morning.
Where is the little baggage?

37
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:49,627
Who are you talking about?

38
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:51,602
Lily Garland, you business giant.

39
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,469
There's nobody of that name
connected with the organization.

40
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:57,374
And please, don't come around here
when you've been drinking.

41
00:02:57,443 --> 00:03:00,469
- It doesn't make for discipline.
- Isn't that too bad?

42
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,777
Call the roll. Lily Garland, front and center.

43
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:08,377
Come on now, fess up. Which one of you
pretty witches is named Lily Garland?

44
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:12,047
Say, what is this wall of silence,
a conspiracy?

45
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,353
Maybe you got the name wrong.

46
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:16,259
Where's the phone? I can still hear, can't I?

47
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:20,026
No, the master spoke with his usual clarity.

48
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,499
Hello, Myrtle, put the wizard on the wire.
He's in the sanctum.

49
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,936
I'll tell him you wish to speak to him.

50
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:37,839
I don't wish to be interrupted now,
Miss Schultz.

51
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:40,279
Mr. O'Malley.

52
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:45,090
I don't want to talk to you now, Owen.
I gave you your orders. Carry them out.

53
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:47,625
Yes, Lily Garland. She's on the stage.

54
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:49,059
She is, is she?

55
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:52,461
Send me down your ouija board
and I'll try and get in touch with her.

56
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:54,432
<i>Can't you carry out your orders?</i>

57
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:58,702
Say, listen, sire, there's only one blonde
roosting on this foul stage.

58
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:01,069
You, with the legs, what' s your name?

59
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,198
Mildred Plotka.

60
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:04,140
She claims her name is Mildred Plotka.

61
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,404
That' s her.

62
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:08,572
I forgot to tell you with all the other things
on my mind.

63
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:13,085
Her old name didn't seem suitable.
I changed it to Lily Garland.

64
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:16,588
Tell Mr. Jacobs he has exactly three minutes
to get everyone assembled.

65
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:17,953
I'm coming right down.

66
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:19,150
Yes, sire.

67
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,128
- What is it? What' s the matter?
- Hold your bonnets.

68
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:26,688
The all-highest is on his way down
amid a shower of meteors.

69
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:37,775
Thank you, child.

70
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:44,006
- Good morning, Mr. Jaffe.
- Good morning.

71
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,778
Well, O.J., welcome to our midst.

72
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:49,845
I don't like anyone chewing gum
on the stage, Oliver. Spit it out, please.

73
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:55,888
- Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
- Good morning, sir.

74
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,293
Sit down, please.

75
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:04,062
I have been looking forward
to this little occasion for some time.

76
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:07,595
There's no thrill in the world
like launching a play.

77
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,400
Watching it come to life little by little.

78
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:15,607
Seeing the living characters emerge
like genii from the bottle.

79
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:19,050
Now, before we begin...

80
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,215
I want you all to remember one thing.

81
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,848
No matter what I may say...

82
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:28,824
no matter what I may do on this stage
during our work...

83
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:31,593
I love you all.

84
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:34,531
The people who have been through
my battles with me...

85
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,898
will bear me out in testifying...

86
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:39,767
that above everything in the world...

87
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:41,430
I love the theater...

88
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:45,008
and the charming people in it.

89
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,570
All right, Oliver, call the rehearsal.

90
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,773
They're all ready.

91
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,180
Thank you, Max,
for carrying the ball thus far.

92
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,945
How does it feel to you?

93
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:56,513
I'd like to talk to you for a minute.

94
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:57,578
Indeed.

95
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:01,652
What appears to be on your mind?

96
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:05,289
I'm afraid Miss Plotka, she isn't going to do.

97
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,492
Miss Plotka? Who is she?

98
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:10,295
Mary Jo, the lead, your latest discovery.

99
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:13,065
You mean Lily Garland? What about her?

100
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:16,336
Let me explain, O.J.
I took a little liberty last night.

101
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:18,137
I think it was an inspiration.

102
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,645
Another one of your inspirations?
Well, out with it.

103
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,772
I happened to run into Francine Anderson...

104
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:25,875
and we got to chinning about the show
and I told her the truth.

105
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:27,010
It slipped out.

106
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:28,246
What slipped out?

107
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:31,620
About Plotka, Garland,
being such a disappointment...

108
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:35,092
such a washout.
And to make a long story short...

109
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,788
I talked Francine into stepping into the part.

110
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:39,388
You did?

111
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:41,558
No, don't. Wait a minute, O.J.

112
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:45,001
So that' s what you've been doing
behind my back. Undermining me again.

113
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,369
- Listen, O.J.
- Francine Anderson.

114
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,069
That piece of human tripe. In my play.

115
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:52,304
Now, wait a minute.

116
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:54,209
What do you know about talent?

117
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,647
What do you know about the theater?
What do you know about genius?

118
00:06:57,717 --> 00:07:00,151
What do you know about anything,
you bookkeeper?

119
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:02,813
You try to force that palooka
down the public's throat...

120
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:04,254
and you'll find out what I know.

121
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:06,814
I've had enough of your treachery. Get out!

122
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:11,927
From now on, I close the iron door on you.

123
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:15,501
Okay. I'll take that job with the Schuberts.

124
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:18,503
- Leave my theatre, you gray rat!
- I'm...

125
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:23,406
And don't have that fat wife of yours
come around again, pleading for you!

126
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:27,703
Let the rehearsal begin.

127
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,805
- Places. Act 1.
- No.

128
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:34,112
We will start with Miss Garlanïs entrance.

129
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:37,451
That' s you all, Mary Jo.
Where'll we send the body?

130
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:38,717
Come on.

131
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:42,022
I'm at the tiller now, Mr. Jacobs.

132
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:51,469
Now, don't be nervous, child.

133
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,303
You're not Lily Garland anymore.

134
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,174
You're little Mary Jo Calhoun.

135
00:07:58,211 --> 00:07:59,872
The scent of jasmine...

136
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:03,507
is floating through the open window
of a summer evening.

137
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:06,346
You've just kissed your lover goodnight.

138
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:09,853
You're full of vibrations.

139
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:12,716
The scene is pure purple...

140
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:16,457
as you come drifting
into this old Southern mansion.

141
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:19,391
All right.

142
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:25,965
The door is opened
by the old family retainer, Uncle Remus.

143
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:28,363
- Yes, sir.
- All ready.

144
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,404
Just a moment.

145
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:39,577
That is the way an iceman
would enter the house. Not Mary Jo.

146
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:41,451
Shyly, please.

147
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,879
Try it again.

148
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,020
"Daddy."

149
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:54,396
Just wait, dear.

150
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:56,898
You're in America now.

151
00:08:57,003 --> 00:09:00,166
Don't you know the Old South
does not yodel?

152
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:02,572
Once more, please.

153
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:10,475
"Daddy.

154
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,279
"Hello, Daddy."

155
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:15,649
Come on, dear child.
Are you nailed to the floor?

156
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:19,853
"You all were talking to somebody
on the lawn. Who was it?

157
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:21,517
"It was Michael, wasn't it?"

158
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:23,289
Frightened, acting frightened.

159
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:26,263
- "It was Michael, Daddy."
- "I thought so."

160
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:28,766
- "Stanley."
- "Where are you all going, Daddy?"

161
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:29,994
Where's the brother?

162
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:33,937
Come on, Brother. Downstairs.
Throw yourself into the room.

163
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,000
"What' s all the matter, Daddy?"

164
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,135
Take out your pistol, Father.

165
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:41,705
"Take your sister to her room, son."

166
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:42,770
"Yes, sir."

167
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,110
"No, Daddy. You all don't..."

168
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:49,416
Just a minute. Where are you going?
This is like a scrimmage.

169
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:50,921
Get me some chalk, Mr. Jacobs.

170
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,083
- Mr. Jaffe, I'm right, this is the...
- I'm sorry.

171
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,592
All right, Brother.

172
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,684
I'm terribly sorry.

173
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:58,059
It' s all right, Mary Jo. Where's the chalk?

174
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,791
Get to your respective places.

175
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:03,767
Now, Mary Jo, I'm going to lay down
tracks for you. Here's the door.

176
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:08,602
Now, when you come on, you stop here
and say, "Daddy."

177
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:12,207
Then over to here.

178
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:15,040
I'll mark it "two."

179
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:17,775
Then when you hear your brother
coming downstairs...

180
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,715
you come over to here, three...

181
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:23,687
then quickly back to here, four.

182
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,388
Then, when your father rushes out...

183
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,393
you won't be knocked down like a ninepin.

184
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,725
Come, we'll start afresh. Entrance.

185
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,490
You're off the track.

186
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:38,431
Let' s get her a trolley.

187
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,869
Quiet, please.
It' s very distracting, that muttering.

188
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:44,000
Now, Mary Jo, remember what I told you.

189
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:45,873
- Mr. Jaffe.
- Who's that?

190
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:47,640
- Excuse me, Mr. Jaffe.
- What?

191
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:50,443
This is the combination of the safe.
It' s the only copy.

192
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:53,781
Why do you bother me with details like that?
What do I hire you for?

193
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:55,445
But you...

194
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:57,716
You hothead.

195
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:01,486
Go over there, sit somewhere
and sit down. Keep out of my way.

196
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,791
Now, come on, Mary Jo, remember...

197
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:07,924
shy but vital. Give it essence.

198
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,063
Give me the chalk, please.

199
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,808
Brother's all right.

200
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,813
Did you get some more chalk?

201
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:28,752
Where are you going to get chalk
in New York at midnight?

202
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:31,756
Try the public schools.
Borrow some from a teacher.

203
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:34,860
School has been out
for some time now, sire.

204
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:39,124
No cooperation from anybody.

205
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:42,999
Never mind. I'll carry through alone.

206
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:48,031
Come on, Mary Jo.

207
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:50,269
Mr. Jaffe, I'm afraid I'm all in.

208
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:53,004
Nonsense, child.
You'll get your second wind in a minute.

209
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:54,273
Where's Uncle Remus?

210
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:55,540
- Yes, sir.
- Father?

211
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:57,775
- Where's your little chum Emmy Lou?
- Right here.

212
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:01,217
Come on, child, get to your place.
We're in the sitting room now.

213
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:04,381
Mary Jo, this time when you hear
of Michael's death...

214
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:07,017
remember what I told you about the scream.

215
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:08,650
It comes from here.

216
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:12,356
Your insides turn to jelly
when you hear the news.

217
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:14,524
And a good long pause after the shot.

218
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,965
Let' s proceed.

219
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:19,529
"Where are you all, Mary Jo?"

220
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:20,833
"What is it, Emmy Lou?"

221
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:23,841
"Your father just met Michael.
He's out there on the lawn."

222
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,934
"Emmy Lou, what are we all going to do?"

223
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:32,777
One, two, sway. Stand there swaying.
Come on, Uncle Remus.

224
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:37,481
"Oh, Lordy, Miss Mary Jo.
Your daddy's just killed Mr. Michael."

225
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,227
What was that?

226
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,258
What?

227
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:49,733
That squeak.

228
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:52,402
Why, Mr. Jaffe...

229
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:56,940
We're going to stay in this theater
till Miss Garland learns how to scream.

230
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:58,067
Dismiss the cast.

231
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:00,772
All right, everybody. 11:00 tomorrow.

232
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:08,648
I can't stand it.
I've done it a thousand times.

233
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:11,212
You can't hammer at me this way
any longer.

234
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,388
Making a fool out of me
in front of everybody.

235
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,952
You squalling little amateur.
On your feet. Get up.

236
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,391
Take that hump out of your back.

237
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,299
You're not demonstrating underwear
anymore.

238
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,303
I've taken all the bullying from you
I'm going to.

239
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:32,504
No man living can kick me around
for eight hours until I can't see straight.

240
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:35,342
I'm a human being, do you hear?
A human being.

241
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:36,779
Now, Miss Garland...

242
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:40,910
My name is Plotka.
It' s a good name, too, just as good as Jaffe.

243
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:46,356
I wanted to be an actress, but I won't
crawl on my stomach for any man.

244
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:48,655
You find somebody else.

245
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:54,830
She's marvelous, just as I thought.

246
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,198
Fire, passion, everything.

247
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:02,235
The gold is all there, but we must mine it.

248
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,616
Lily Garland, I only heard one thing:

249
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,659
that you want to be an actress.

250
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,857
That' s all I want, too.

251
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:26,657
Look at me.

252
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:32,136
Duse had that modeling.

253
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:36,908
Now we're going to teach little Mary Jo
how to scream.

254
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:39,804
Do you trust me, child?

255
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:41,545
Yes.

256
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:44,445
I'm going to find the soul that' s there
and release it...

257
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:47,781
so it' ll fly, soar up to the top gallery.

258
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:49,081
- Oliver.
- Yes, O.J.

259
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:50,621
Go up there. I want you to listen.

260
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:53,021
- Now, listen, O.J.
- Go on.

261
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:56,787
Now, you're going to lift Mr. Webb
out of his seat with that scream.

262
00:14:56,862 --> 00:14:59,660
Come on, child. I'll take all the other parts.

263
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:01,499
Do you want the manuscript?

264
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:04,195
I slept with that manuscript for six months.

265
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:07,205
Come on now, dear. Take off your coat.
We're going into action.

266
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:09,639
There are 2,000 people out there.

267
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,741
All the way up, I said, Oliver.

268
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:14,540
Go on.

269
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:26,689
We'll go back, so that when we come
to the scream, you'll be in the mood.

270
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,750
Now, Emmy Lou comes on.

271
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:32,256
"Mary Jo, where are you, Mary Jo?"

272
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:33,423
"What is it, Emmy Lou?"

273
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:36,366
"Mary Jo, your daddy just met Michael.
They're on the lawn."

274
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,300
"Emmy Lou, what are we all going to do?"

275
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:43,168
Remember the pause. Sway.

276
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:45,704
Keep swaying. Come on, Uncle Remus.

277
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:54,241
"Oh, Lordy, Miss Mary Jo, your daddy's
just gone and shot Mr. Michael."

278
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:03,019
Perfect! Marvelous! How was it, Oliver?

279
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,062
Okay from here.

280
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:10,097
Splendid. Excellent. Brava. <i>Magnifico.</i>

281
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:51,409
Great, Lily. I always knew you'd do it.

282
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:55,243
It' s a smash. The people are waiting
to draw your carriage through the streets.

283
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:57,145
- Where's Mr. Jaffe?
- Never mind. Come on.

284
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:59,241
Make way for Miss Garland there.

285
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:02,084
- But, Owen...
- I'll get him. Go on in.

286
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,885
Say, Mr. Jaffe, it looks like a knockout.

287
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,198
I want to see Mr. Jaffe.

288
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:19,135
You can't see Mr. Jaffe now. He's busy.

289
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:30,275
Was I all right? Was I what you wanted?

290
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:43,651
I came to pay my respects to a great actress.

291
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,301
Go outside, Sadie.

292
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:03,210
I came to apologize and be forgiven...

293
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:06,911
for all those mean things
I said during rehearsals, Lily.

294
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:09,619
Forgive you? Don't talk like that.

295
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:12,555
Everything they applauded was yours,
everything they liked.

296
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:15,457
I felt it was you out there
going through the performance.

297
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:18,894
That' s very generous of you,
but the diamond was there.

298
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:21,364
I merely supplied a little polish.

299
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:25,362
I'm so happy.
And the scream, was it all right?

300
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:29,864
I saved the pin as a souvenir.

301
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:32,704
The sorrows of life are the joys of art.

302
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:37,205
I suppose you have a lot of engagements
this evening?

303
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:40,445
I was going home and dream
about everything that happened tonight.

304
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:42,350
Tonight' s merely the beginning.

305
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:44,855
You're at the foot of the golden stair.

306
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,481
Lily Garland...

307
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:49,692
I'm going to take you by this little hand...

308
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:54,562
higher and further than any woman
of the theater has ever gone before.

309
00:18:55,300 --> 00:19:00,237
The beauty and glamour that were mine
for a little while during those rehearsals...

310
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:03,405
when you thought I was so cruel...

311
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:05,834
now belong to the world...

312
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:09,346
forever and evermore.

313
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:11,974
- Are you there, Mulligan?
- Yes, Mr. Jaffe.

314
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:25,529
It once hung on Bernhard' s door.

315
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:29,796
I almost wish it weren't there.

316
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:31,091
Why?

317
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:36,069
It' s the golden mark that henceforth
sets you apart from the world...

318
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:41,002
beyond the reach of any one man
to have and to hold.

319
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,439
Don't say that. It frightens me.

320
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:48,041
Would you let me kiss you goodbye?

321
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:52,048
Yes.

322
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:02,928
Oscar, don't leave me now.
I'm nothing without you. I never will be.

323
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,462
Where are you going?

324
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:38,264
It' s been ringing 10 minutes.

325
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:40,237
Let it ring. Is Mr. Jaffe.

326
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:43,240
He can stand there pushing that bell
till he rots.

327
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:47,176
Remember the last time
we tried to keep him out? He had fits.

328
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:48,435
Fits.

329
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,774
I'll give him fits. Plenty of them.

330
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:54,084
Oscar, I'm going to...

331
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:58,953
Playing possum?

332
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:03,123
- So Oscar sent you up?
- Nothing of the kind.

333
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:06,494
I wouldn't answer the telephone,
so he gets you to carry his messages.

334
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:07,793
You got it all wrong.

335
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:10,096
I was passing by
and saw your light in the window.

336
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:13,331
I'll make your dirty work easy.
I'm going out tonight to the Ritz.

337
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:14,997
You can tell Mr. Jaffe.

338
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:17,633
The first good time I've had in three years.

339
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:21,477
Sadie, my chinchilla coat,
the one with the silver lining.

340
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:23,571
And her shepherïs crook, Sadie.

341
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:30,851
Say, what' s the meaning of this,
skulking behind barricades?

342
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:33,982
- Did he tell you what the fight was about?
- Well, I...

343
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:39,226
I gathered that in some obscure way...

344
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:41,194
you destroyed his career.

345
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:43,131
Get off that bed. It' s real lace.

346
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:44,964
How do you sleep in this contrivance?

347
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:46,527
Be all right with a pair of oars.

348
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:49,438
Sadie, get me a bottle of gin.
I've only got an hour to live.

349
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:51,237
I wish that were true.

350
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:53,504
Owen, I'll tell you exactly what happened.

351
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:56,809
That Mr. Whatsit of the Mayfair Club
called me up...

352
00:21:56,882 --> 00:22:00,079
and told me they were having
a Lily Garland night and would I come?

353
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,120
Oscar was right there beside me.

354
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:03,313
Rowing?

355
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:04,678
Never mind.

356
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:08,283
He heard the whole conversation,
heard me accept it and never said a word.

357
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,454
I didn't think anything had happened
until I got to rehearsal...

358
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:15,159
and it was "Miss Garland" this
and "Miss Garland" that all over the place.

359
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:17,531
Then he started making those awful faces...

360
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:21,299
simply because he doesn't want me
to mingle with what he calls riffraff...

361
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:24,570
and that' s everybody in the world
except us two.

362
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:27,077
We just sit here and discuss his genius.

363
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:31,013
I'm going out tonight and have a look
at some plain human beings for once...

364
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:32,641
and act like one.

365
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:33,946
I've got a new dress.

366
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:37,011
The first in three years
that doesn't make me look like a Quaker.

367
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:40,024
- Lily.
- You, too? Is he calling out the militia?

368
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:41,559
Can I speak to you confidentially?

369
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:43,423
Go easy, warden, she's got a case.

370
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:45,929
Get out, Owen.
This is a question of life or death.

371
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:47,487
I'll go to my cabin.

372
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:51,869
- Lily, it' s up to you.
- What is?

373
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:54,633
I'm afraid for him, Lily.
He's got that look in his eyes.

374
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,799
I don't care what he's got in his eyes.

375
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,366
- You don't understand him, Lily.
- I don't?

376
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:01,412
When he's wounded,
he's capable of anything.

377
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,472
He's not capable of keeping me
from going to the Mayfair Club.

378
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,449
Sadie, don't wait up for me. I'll be late.

379
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:10,386
It' s none of my business, but after all
he's done for you, I'd go a little easy.

380
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:13,083
He made a million dollars off me,
if that' s what you mean.

381
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:15,888
And I'm not catering
to his senseless, neurotic...

382
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:18,953
egomaniac jealousies any longer.
I'm no Trilby.

383
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,634
Get out, boys.

384
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:31,174
- O.J., can I speak to you alone?
- No.

385
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,671
What time shall I call rehearsal tomorrow?

386
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:36,674
Tomorrow.

387
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:40,011
Goodbye, boys.

388
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,347
All right, D'Artagnan.

389
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:45,083
We'll be lurking on the drawbridge
if you need us. Come on, Oliver.

390
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,153
Oscar, I don't want a scene.

391
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:53,491
I'm all dressed up and I'm going.

392
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,463
Stop making those awful faces.

393
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:58,264
I'm not doing anything
you could possibly object to, Oscar.

394
00:23:58,336 --> 00:23:59,633
I won't have a scene.

395
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:01,035
You can't bully me.

396
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:04,633
For three years, I've never done anything,
read anything, eaten anything...

397
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:06,336
without asking your permission twice.

398
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:09,437
Never met anybody.
I can't even see my own mother.

399
00:24:09,514 --> 00:24:11,846
That' s not love, it' s pure tyranny.

400
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,119
Goodbye, Lily.

401
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:24,088
Oscar.

402
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:28,594
Our little comedy is ending,
just as I always knew it would.

403
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:33,035
You remember that night
you won your spurs...

404
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:36,966
and we tacked a golden star
on your dressing room door...

405
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:40,478
and I told you, you were not for one man
to have and to hold?

406
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:43,207
Go on, Lily.

407
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:48,349
Go and dance in that lovely dress
at that awful place.

408
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:54,219
Let them paw the beauty and glamour
that is mine...

409
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:57,422
for a moment.

410
00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:01,257
- What are you talking about? I'm just...
- Please.

411
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,631
They're waiting for you. You'll be late.

412
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:05,033
What are you going to do?

413
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:08,072
Nothing, while you're here.

414
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:10,935
New York.

415
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:17,546
It received me once when I came here,
a little farm boy.

416
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:21,618
It' ll receive me again.

417
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:27,717
I remember on many a winter's eve...
Lily Garland, I haven't finished yet.

418
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:29,919
Some night when the curtain comes down...

419
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:33,761
and that little world of yours sits there
applauding you, you'll remember me.

420
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:35,527
You'll know I helped a little.

421
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,692
Goodbye.

422
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:37,961
Oscar!

423
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:46,141
You horrible fake. Be a man.

424
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,907
You're not going to jump out
of any window.

425
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:51,847
Trying to make me believe, you cheap ham.

426
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:55,342
You can't talk to me like that.
You forget who I am.

427
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:58,355
I'll tell you what you are. A fake.
Go on, jump. Kill yourself.

428
00:25:58,423 --> 00:26:00,618
You washwoman's daughter.

429
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:02,387
What did you call me?

430
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:07,189
Soaking yourself in perfume like a hired girl.

431
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:10,394
Half undressed for other men.

432
00:26:11,002 --> 00:26:12,629
You don't fool me.

433
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:22,975
Go on, hit me.

434
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:25,005
I'm not stopping you.

435
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:33,455
Lily, I wouldn't hurt you
for anything in the world.

436
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:35,993
Do what you want. Go anywhere you want...

437
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:38,218
only just love me.

438
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:40,058
Say you forgive me.

439
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:44,926
It' s all right. Just don't talk.

440
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:49,233
Put your arms around me. Just hold me.

441
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,788
What a glorious morning. I'm so happy.

442
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:13,558
Do you want me to wait for you, sweet?

443
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:14,724
I don't think so, darling.

444
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,563
You run along and rehearse without me
for a couple of hours.

445
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:19,729
I'm going over the manuscript again,
polishing.

446
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:24,036
Oscar, do you mean to say you're going
to trust me to go to the theater alone?

447
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:27,539
Lily, that' s all changed.

448
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:30,005
I meant every word I said. You'll see.

449
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:32,572
From now on,
I'm not going to be jealous anymore.

450
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:35,211
When you're like this,
I don't want anybody but you.

451
00:27:35,286 --> 00:27:37,754
You know, I've had my lesson, Lily.

452
00:27:38,023 --> 00:27:40,048
Something happened to me last night.

453
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:41,922
That moment at the window.

454
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,462
A sort of change of soul.

455
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:46,724
From now on
you can go and come as you please...

456
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:48,561
and no questions asked whatsoever.

457
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:50,260
I trust you implicitly.

458
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:53,537
- Goodbye, sweet.
- Goodbye, my lovely Lily.

459
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,197
Sadie, did you call the car?

460
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:58,401
- Yes, ma'am.
- Well, hurry up.

461
00:28:01,312 --> 00:28:02,438
Hello.

462
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:05,042
Bleeker 82711.

463
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:10,810
Hello, is this
the McGonigle Detective Agency?

464
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:13,517
Mr. McGonigle speaking. Who?

465
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,118
How do you do, Mr. Jaffe?

466
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:18,685
Glad to hear from you.
What can I do for you this time?

467
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:21,254
I have an actress in my employ
named Lily Garland.

468
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:22,594
Yeah. That' s right.

469
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:25,500
I want her watched, every move,
day and night. Her mail...

470
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:28,198
and can you tap the telephone wires
in her apartment?

471
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:31,674
Yes, Mr. Jaffe.
Tapping telephone wires is our specialty.

472
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:50,659
These are the telephone reports of all calls.

473
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,924
Forty minutes conversation
with the dressmaker...

474
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:54,658
and never told me anything about it.

475
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,928
The bill is for $1,200.

476
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:58,767
Send him a check.

477
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,396
Yes, sir.

478
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:03,935
Good morning.

479
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:07,969
Why aren't you at rehearsal?

480
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:12,210
- You don't need me every minute.
- O.J., just between us, is Lily all right?

481
00:29:12,283 --> 00:29:15,150
I mean, has there been any trouble
in the last week or two?

482
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,949
Certainly not. Whas the matter?

483
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:19,854
You've gotten her upset again.
I told you not to upset her.

484
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:22,415
I was just wondering
if there was any special reason...

485
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:24,394
why she didn't show up at rehearsal today.

486
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:26,020
She was all right when I left.

487
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:28,156
She sounded all right to me this morning.

488
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:30,394
- Get her on the phone.
- I did talk to her.

489
00:29:30,468 --> 00:29:33,301
There seems to be some interference
on her telephone.

490
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:37,102
I've arranged to have someone
go over it from stem to stern.

491
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:39,341
You've done what?

492
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:41,610
You see, O. J...

493
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:45,238
the Vice President of
the telephone company is a friend of mine...

494
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:47,944
- and he promised immediate action.
- You gray rat.

495
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:52,012
Mr. Jaffe, Mr. McGonigle is outside.
I think something's happened.

496
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:55,357
Have him come in.

497
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:56,889
Mr. McGonigle.

498
00:29:57,428 --> 00:29:58,895
Mr. Jaffe, I'm resigning.

499
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:02,023
I undertook this job in good faith,
under the seal of secrecy.

500
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,362
What happened?

501
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,827
She was laying for me in the vestibule.

502
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:09,431
She jumped out with a stick in her hand
just as I was collecting the mail.

503
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:11,634
Who told her that phone was tapped?

504
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:18,440
Stay where you are, Judas Iscariot.

505
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:22,981
McGonigle, did you deny it?
Did you throw the lie in her face?

506
00:30:23,054 --> 00:30:25,249
I stuck with her until she got on the train.

507
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,655
- She almost tore my clothes off.
- What train?

508
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:30,216
We had an awful lot of trouble
through traffic.

509
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:33,355
- She was in her car and I was following...
- Stop babbling.

510
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:35,058
What train did she take?

511
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:36,760
The one to Hollywood.

512
00:30:37,802 --> 00:30:39,793
- Hollywood?
- Yes, sir.

513
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:43,932
And she told me to tell you
that she was through with you forever.

514
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:47,375
Oliver, did you hear that?

515
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:49,473
She's left me.

516
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:51,981
Say the word, O.J., and I'll kill myself.

517
00:30:53,618 --> 00:30:55,643
Gone. Lily.

518
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:12,997
How could you do it?

519
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:38,552
I'll go find her.
I'll bring her back, wherever she is.

520
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:41,190
No. Put me back in the bullring.

521
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:44,235
Sew me up like a picador's horse.

522
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:48,566
Blind me eyes. Let life run over me.

523
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:01,644
I'm willing to do anything
to make amends, O.J.

524
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:07,084
Mockery.

525
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:21,733
Take that name off. Block it out.

526
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:25,742
Look out, O.J. You'll hurt somebody.
We'll have a lawsuit on our hands.

527
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:31,039
Anathema. Child of Satan.

528
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:35,717
No more Lily Garland.

529
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:39,120
Wipe her off the face of the earth,
back into oblivion, Lily Garland.

530
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:41,658
- What' s Rembrandt up to?
- Owen, look.

531
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:44,422
Oblivion.

532
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:48,630
Owen, have the evening papers
gone to press yet?

533
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,463
- In about an hour.
- Get out your pencil.

534
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:52,400
You're in no mood to talk to publications.

535
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,836
- Lie down for a while.
- Are you still here? Get out.

536
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:59,172
I want to make a statement to the press.
I have just fired Lily Garland.

537
00:32:59,243 --> 00:33:02,508
I've thrown her out of my theater
like a dead rat.

538
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,740
Now take it easy, sire.

539
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:07,979
What are we going to do, O.J.?
The announcements are up for the opening.

540
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:10,151
- We'll open.
- But how?

541
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:13,713
Do you think I need any Lily Garland
to open a show of mine?

542
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:16,589
There's no actress in town
who can hold a candle to her.

543
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,652
There isn't? I'll show you.

544
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:20,493
- But who? Who, O.J.?
- Quiet.

545
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:25,432
You, come here.

546
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:32,336
- Now listen to me, O. J...
- Quiet.

547
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:35,839
- What' s your name?
- Valerie Whitehouse.

548
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:39,676
Give Miss Whitehouse Miss Garland' s part.

549
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:41,241
I know it, Mr. Jaffe.

550
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:43,378
O.J., you're crazy. This girl can't act.

551
00:33:43,454 --> 00:33:46,014
She hasn't had any experience.
She's just out of stock.

552
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:49,617
You remember a little lingerie model
named Mildred Plotka...

553
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,685
who was once on this stage,
who couldn't act?

554
00:33:51,763 --> 00:33:54,288
I don't care. I'm not going to let you do this.

555
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:56,299
You're making a fool of yourself.

556
00:33:56,367 --> 00:34:00,360
Lily Garland' s been putting up with
all this tripe you've been getting away with.

557
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:01,496
You amoeba.

558
00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:03,506
It' s the truth, whether you know it or not.

559
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:06,270
Owen, take this creature...

560
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:10,975
who came to me as an office boy,
as Max Mandlebaum...

561
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:14,347
and who is now Max Jacobs
for some mysterious reason...

562
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:15,750
and throw him into the street.

563
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,378
You don't have to throw me. I'll go.

564
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:20,015
- By the scruff of the neck.
- But I'll tell you something.

565
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:21,080
Out!

566
00:34:22,026 --> 00:34:24,187
I close the iron door on you.

567
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:25,757
Okay.

568
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,262
Let the rehearsal begin.

569
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:34,566
Miss Whitehouse,
we'll take your entrance in Act 1.

570
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,639
Oliver, give me some chalk.

571
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:04,968
Chicago. What a town.

572
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:07,527
They should never have taken it away
from the Indians.

573
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:10,972
It' s a good town for a good show.
The Worlïs Fair proved that.

574
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:13,272
Yeah. Fan dances and flea circuses.

575
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:16,370
When you came here two years ago
with Lily Garland...

576
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:19,575
the sheriff didn't have
to tack a sign on the stage door.

577
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:23,450
True, my good mignon, but the sheriff
has been playing a very important part...

578
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:24,818
in our last four productions.

579
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:27,016
All right. Okay. We'll see about that.

580
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:29,457
- What' d he say?
- The sheriff won't listen to reason.

581
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:33,190
If he doesn't get his money by tomorrow
morning, Jaffe don't leave this town.

582
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:35,698
- Kind of tough on Chicago.
- "Joan of Arc."

583
00:35:35,766 --> 00:35:39,293
There was absolutely no excuse
for that show. I told him so.

584
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,167
He's going to end up in the breadline...

585
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:43,366
unless he finds out
that these horse operas...

586
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:47,241
with a lot of people staggering around
in foul iron suits ain't entertainment.

587
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:48,369
Where did you leave Jaffe?

588
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:50,778
At the Morrison Hotel
under the name of Hemingway...

589
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:52,213
which he's adopted in his grief.

590
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:54,649
What are his plans,
further than returning tomorrow?

591
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:56,778
He's going to shoot himself with a gun.

592
00:35:56,854 --> 00:36:00,119
If he gets on that trapeze again,
I'm going to hand him the revolver.

593
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:03,217
He won't kill himself.
Id please too many people.

594
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:07,196
Give me a double bicarbonate of soda.
Thas the fifth I've had today.

595
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:09,625
Oliver, look.

596
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:11,626
Oblivion.

597
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:14,863
The biggest thing in pictures.

598
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:16,372
We could use her.

599
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:18,135
Four flops in a row since she left.

600
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:19,801
Five. I blame her for everything.

601
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:22,277
When she left Jaffe,
she took his genius with her.

602
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:25,941
Do you know how much he paid for
long-distance calls to Hollywood last year?

603
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:29,180
$1,800, and she hung up on him every time.

604
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:32,446
In some Humpty Dumpty way,
that was true love.

605
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:35,558
Yeah, Romeo and Juliet.

606
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:40,959
<i>20th Century leaving for New York</i>
<i>on Track 6. All aboard.</i>

607
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:49,471
Say, listen, my fine-feathered friend,
you're just wasting your time...

608
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,837
patrolling this lonely coast.

609
00:36:50,908 --> 00:36:53,035
Mr. Jaffe is not getting on this train.

610
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:57,046
I'll say he ain't.
I've got four men watching every gate.

611
00:36:57,114 --> 00:36:59,912
He ain't going to leave this state
without paying up...

612
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:02,418
and if you're a smart young fellow...

613
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:04,511
you'll stop making a nuisance of yourself.

614
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:06,113
So you're gonna get personal?

615
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:08,351
I'll cool you off in 17 shades of lavender.

616
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:09,450
Here, what' s going on?

617
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:11,461
This demigod thinks he's in darkest Russia.

618
00:37:11,529 --> 00:37:14,794
Now, just a minute, Owen.
Who is your immediate superior?

619
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:17,629
Never mind that. You see this picture?

620
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:20,293
The minute I lay eyes on this fellow, Jaffe...

621
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:23,807
he's going right over
to the South Clark Street Police Station.

622
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:28,534
I beg your pardon, sir.
May I trouble you all for a match?

623
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:31,207
Sure thing, brother. Here.

624
00:37:31,782 --> 00:37:32,976
Thank you.

625
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:42,319
I'm taking the 20th Century.
I hope I ain't late.

626
00:37:42,393 --> 00:37:45,726
No, it' s over there. You can just make it.

627
00:37:45,896 --> 00:37:47,329
Thanks for your courtesy, sir.

628
00:37:47,398 --> 00:37:49,332
That' s perfectly all right.

629
00:37:52,336 --> 00:37:55,828
There's no use quarreling with
this gentleman. He's only doing his duty.

630
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:58,534
If he's going to arrest Jaffe,
he's going to arrest him.

631
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:00,702
- We can't prevent it.
- All right, Oliver.

632
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:02,336
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye.

633
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:04,745
Thank you all for your hospitality, sir.

634
00:38:04,815 --> 00:38:07,477
Come down and have a julep
with we all sometime, sir.

635
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:08,916
I will, thank you.

636
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:24,528
Very clever, O.J.

637
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:26,832
You had us both fooled for a minute.

638
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:31,765
I never thought I should sink so low
as to become an actor.

639
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,510
It was humiliating.

640
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:37,444
Too bad you didn't play Joan of Arc.

641
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:38,846
Never mind that, Owen.

642
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:41,976
You've been drinking again.
Go and order lunch.

643
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:45,221
Tell them to put me by myself
at a large table.

644
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:48,053
How do you suppose I'm going to do that?
The diner's packed.

645
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:50,389
Tell them it' s for me. Go on.

646
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:53,191
If you want privacy,
why don't you travel in a balloon?

647
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:55,994
O.J., we might as well get it over.

648
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,466
I've got some unpleasant figures here.

649
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:03,298
Do you know what I was thinking about?
On the way to the train?

650
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:05,274
Nothing morbid, I hope.

651
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:08,376
That of all my 68 productions...

652
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:11,237
the most artistic was <i>Joan of Arc.</i>

653
00:39:11,315 --> 00:39:15,012
Yes, it would have been fine if the audience
had known what it was all about.

654
00:39:15,086 --> 00:39:16,451
Audience.

655
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:19,848
I saw the play five times
and cried like a baby.

656
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:23,585
That fire effect was pure genius.
I've never done anything better.

657
00:39:23,661 --> 00:39:28,598
Fire effect and all, we're $74,000
and a few pennies in the hole.

658
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:30,531
Care to look at it?

659
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:32,933
What a magnificent failure.

660
00:39:33,604 --> 00:39:37,267
If I'm a genius, Oliver,
it' s because of my failure.

661
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:39,199
Always remember that.

662
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:48,013
May I take your bag, sir?

663
00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:50,713
Just keep your hands off my bag
and don't bother me.

664
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:53,848
I don't want to see you again
from here to New York City.

665
00:39:53,924 --> 00:39:55,050
Yes, sir.

666
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:26,617
"Repent, for the time is at hand."

667
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,471
Get Flannagan.

668
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:49,035
Yes, sir.

669
00:40:51,649 --> 00:40:52,707
Listen, O.J.

670
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:56,014
Don't talk about money matters now,
Oliver. Do you mind?

671
00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:59,544
I've got to. The first thing
they're going to do tomorrow morning...

672
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:02,922
is to land on the Jaffe Theatre with a writ
and take it away from you.

673
00:41:02,993 --> 00:41:05,257
- And whiskers won't save you.
- They wouldn't dare.

674
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:07,797
Now listen, O.J., there's one way out of this.

675
00:41:07,865 --> 00:41:11,733
Not exactly pleasant, I grant you,
but we can't afford to be squeamish.

676
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:15,567
Now, I had a telegram this morning
from little Max Jacobs.

677
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:19,036
Communicating with Max Jacobs?

678
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:21,669
- Now listen, O.J., I know...
- Treachery?

679
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:23,804
Max Jacobs, that office boy that I fired.

680
00:41:23,881 --> 00:41:26,941
All right, office boy,
but he's got a cold million in the bank.

681
00:41:27,017 --> 00:41:29,884
Now, he's produced three straight
dramatic smashes in a row...

682
00:41:29,954 --> 00:41:33,082
while you've been laying one bad egg
after another. Now that' s fact.

683
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,749
I've had enough of your treachery.

684
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:36,122
- Max Jacobs...
- Get out!

685
00:41:36,193 --> 00:41:37,888
...is the only man that can save you.

686
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:39,293
You Judas.

687
00:41:39,363 --> 00:41:43,732
Go to Mandlebaum or whatever his name is.
You're fired.

688
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:48,271
I know, the iron door.
Okay, I've had enough.

689
00:41:51,108 --> 00:41:53,008
- Say, Oliver...
- And I mean it.

690
00:41:59,216 --> 00:42:01,707
I understand how you feel,
but tell me what happened.

691
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:04,151
I was sitting there reading,
when all of a sudden...

692
00:42:04,221 --> 00:42:05,654
I felt something hit my head.

693
00:42:05,723 --> 00:42:06,781
Did you see anybody pass?

694
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:09,621
No, but when I took off my cap
I found this sticker on it.

695
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:11,126
"Repent, for the time is at hand."

696
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:13,288
Who do you suppose
could be doing such a thing?

697
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:15,525
I don't know, but I've got a pretty good idea.

698
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,397
There's a certain drunk on this train
and I'll talk to him.

699
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:20,198
Come on, Flannagan.

700
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:28,307
- This has gone just far enough.
- What' s biting you?

701
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,870
We had to wash all those things off
with soap and water.

702
00:42:30,948 --> 00:42:33,246
- What things?
- You don't know anything about it?

703
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:34,409
What are you yapping about?

704
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:36,953
- You've got one on your hat.
- Keep your hands off me.

705
00:42:37,021 --> 00:42:39,421
- Is this the same one?
- Yeah, it sure is.

706
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:42,755
- Is this an insane asylum?
- It' s the work of that man who's with you.

707
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:44,020
- Mr. Jaffe?
- No, the other one.

708
00:42:44,094 --> 00:42:47,120
I'm going to turn him over to the authorities.
This is vandalism.

709
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:48,892
- You got a drink?
- See here, young man...

710
00:42:48,966 --> 00:42:50,331
Let him alone. I can handle him.

711
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:53,165
Redskin, me, want firewater.
Plenty wampum. Quick.

712
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:55,330
I paid $12 for that derby.

713
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:58,204
Why did you paste this?
That' s kindergarten stuff.

714
00:42:58,275 --> 00:43:00,766
You'll clean this train
with hot water and soap...

715
00:43:00,844 --> 00:43:02,277
and remove all the stickers.

716
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:04,871
You're screwier than a pretzel.
"Repent for the time..."

717
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:07,315
Are you accusing me
of circulating that propaganda?

718
00:43:07,384 --> 00:43:11,445
Somebody just went to the dining room
and put stickers on all the windows.

719
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:14,514
- What?
- I guess that exonerates Mr. O'Malley.

720
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,924
He won't get away from us this time.
Come on.

721
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:20,225
- Did you see him?
- Whoever he was, he's pretty smart, sir.

722
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,866
- What a trip.
- Join Jaffe and see the world.

723
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:28,632
- Don't mention Jaffe's name to me.
- What' s the matter now?

724
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:31,869
Same old thing.
He doesn't know it yet, but I'm through.

725
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:36,072
I've let that egomaniac jump up and down
on my stomach for the last 16 years...

726
00:43:36,146 --> 00:43:37,511
but this is the end.

727
00:43:37,581 --> 00:43:41,608
Maybe when he's hanging from the rafters
with all of Broadway pecking his eyes out...

728
00:43:41,685 --> 00:43:45,382
maybe he'll realize
what I've done for him. Yeah, maybe.

729
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:47,856
- Englewood.
- Owen.

730
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:49,459
- What is it?
- Look.

731
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,095
Lily Garland.

732
00:43:54,765 --> 00:43:56,562
Look out, she's getting on.

733
00:43:57,935 --> 00:43:59,960
Look out. Don't let her see you.

734
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:03,039
All right, hurry up. Get out.
Everything's all right.

735
00:44:03,107 --> 00:44:06,133
Oh, another compartment.

736
00:44:06,276 --> 00:44:09,006
I told you to get a room with a bed in it,
so I can sleep.

737
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:11,980
- There isn't any bed.
- You're a liar. Go ask the conductor.

738
00:44:12,049 --> 00:44:14,609
Just a minute, darling.
This moron is driving me crazy.

739
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:17,586
- What' s the trouble now?
- The company promised me a bed.

740
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,589
Sadie, it' s on the train somewhere.

741
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,625
- Go on, step on it, Sadie.
- Go on, please.

742
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:23,250
There isn't any bed on the train.

743
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:25,318
Calling me a liar? Go on.

744
00:44:25,396 --> 00:44:27,261
I'm sick and tired of this whole trip.

745
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:29,424
You're mad? Well, you...

746
00:44:30,034 --> 00:44:32,059
I despise temperament.

747
00:44:32,569 --> 00:44:35,299
George, darling, goodbye.
I'm going to miss you so much.

748
00:44:35,372 --> 00:44:37,272
But it isn't goodbye. I'm not getting off.

749
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:38,706
I'm going to New York with you.

750
00:44:38,776 --> 00:44:40,903
Darling, don't be silly.
What will people think?

751
00:44:40,978 --> 00:44:43,674
"Famous film star
smuggles young society man aboard train."

752
00:44:43,747 --> 00:44:47,012
- <i>All aboard.</i>
- Darling, I'm going to miss you. Goodbye.

753
00:44:47,484 --> 00:44:51,420
- I'm missing you already.
- But you needn't, dear. I'm not leaving you.

754
00:44:51,488 --> 00:44:53,979
- What are you talking about?
- Just what I said.

755
00:44:54,058 --> 00:44:55,923
- I'm going with you.
- George, we're moving.

756
00:44:55,993 --> 00:44:57,688
- I don't care.
- The train is moving.

757
00:44:57,761 --> 00:44:59,729
- Do as I say.
- I will not get off this train!

758
00:44:59,797 --> 00:45:01,059
It' s too late now anyway.

759
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:03,599
- This is fine, isn't it?
- Go on. Rave on.

760
00:45:03,667 --> 00:45:06,295
I suppose I'm seeing the true you at last.

761
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:10,101
Fame, success, empty words.

762
00:45:10,174 --> 00:45:11,436
What is therein?

763
00:45:11,508 --> 00:45:14,443
- Stop making those awful faces.
- Stop acting.

764
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:17,775
This is going to be a pleasant journey.

765
00:45:18,682 --> 00:45:20,707
George, you annoy me.

766
00:45:20,784 --> 00:45:23,719
Let' s tell His Highness
they've pitched their wigwam next door.

767
00:45:23,787 --> 00:45:26,347
I'm not talking to him.
If I was, I'd tell him something.

768
00:45:26,423 --> 00:45:28,482
- About what?
- About a million dollars' worth...

769
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,925
if Jaffe and that girl
could get together again.

770
00:45:30,994 --> 00:45:33,019
Yes, Russia and Japan
might get together, too.

771
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:36,260
I don't know whether you realize
but I've had an influence with her.

772
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:39,530
Me, too. Once I actually compelled her
to admit it looked like rain.

773
00:45:39,603 --> 00:45:42,071
Do you think there's a chance
of them getting together?

774
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:45,404
- The quickest way to find out is to ask her.
- Not me. Count me out.

775
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:47,808
Mr. Jaffe fired me once too often.

776
00:45:47,878 --> 00:45:50,711
All right, stay there and pout if you want to.

777
00:45:50,781 --> 00:45:53,375
I still don't see why you wanted
to go to New York alone.

778
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:57,250
- George, you've got to believe in me.
- Yes, when you're dead.

779
00:45:58,088 --> 00:46:00,556
Hello, you peculiar witch.
How's the baby Bernhardt?

780
00:46:00,624 --> 00:46:03,752
The foul Corsican himself.
Who let you on this train?

781
00:46:03,827 --> 00:46:07,194
Say, if you only knew all the trouble we had
getting on this gondola.

782
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:08,891
- Who is we?
- Guess.

783
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:10,800
Holy Moses!

784
00:46:10,868 --> 00:46:13,837
You two mind letting me in
on some of these trade secrets?

785
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:15,496
Mr. O'Malley, Mr. Smith.

786
00:46:15,572 --> 00:46:17,802
- How do you do?
- I didn't get the name.

787
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:20,173
Is Oscar Jaffe on this train?
You'd better tell me.

788
00:46:20,244 --> 00:46:23,509
Right in there. The Little Corporal
is returning from another Moscow.

789
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:25,172
His head bloodied but still unbowed.

790
00:46:25,249 --> 00:46:27,717
Jaffe? That' s why you didn't want me
aboard the train.

791
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:30,652
Shut up. I didn't know he was here.
This is the limit.

792
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:32,848
Listen to me, Lily. I've got to know it.

793
00:46:32,923 --> 00:46:35,221
- Are you going to see this man?
- See him?

794
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:37,954
You think I'm out of my mind?
Thank you for telling me.

795
00:46:38,028 --> 00:46:40,895
I won't step outside this room.
He knew I was on this train...

796
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:42,795
but it' s not going to do him any good.

797
00:46:42,866 --> 00:46:46,097
Owen, I'm free from Mr. Jaffe
and I'm going to stay free.

798
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:49,230
What are you all so scared of, Mary Jo?

799
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:52,537
Scared? That man's belittled
and tortured me for three years.

800
00:46:52,609 --> 00:46:56,670
Ran around telling everybody, "Where would
Lily Garland be without the great Jaffe?"

801
00:46:56,747 --> 00:47:00,911
Well, I think I showed him.
Right on top of the ladder and going up.

802
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:05,580
The lies he told about me and my mom.
Called himself my Svengali.

803
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:09,953
- Hello, Lily.
- You, too?

804
00:47:11,061 --> 00:47:13,052
- Coming back into the fold?
- Am I what?

805
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:16,327
- Did Oscar tell you to ask me that?
- Lily, don't fly off the handle.

806
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,925
Confidentially, I'm not with Jaffe anymore.
Ask Owen.

807
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:21,664
If that egomaniac were in his grave,
the way I feel now...

808
00:47:21,738 --> 00:47:25,196
I'd take a rope and tie it around his neck
and take him on a cook's tour.

809
00:47:25,275 --> 00:47:28,802
- He's played his last dirty trick on me.
- I don't care what you do.

810
00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:30,471
I want to tip you off to something.

811
00:47:30,547 --> 00:47:32,310
Is it all right to talk in front of...

812
00:47:32,382 --> 00:47:34,782
You can get right out now,
that' s what you can do.

813
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:37,787
I happen to be calling on Miss Garland.
I want you to listen.

814
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:40,323
Oscar's broke.
They're going to take his theater away.

815
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:41,550
That' s kind of interesting.

816
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:45,755
They've got him across a barrel.
I'm afraid he's going to do the Dutch act.

817
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:49,128
Still jumping out of windows?
Old fainting Bertha.

818
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:53,067
Don't laugh at him, Lily. If you don't
come across for him, it' s curtains for him.

819
00:47:53,136 --> 00:47:54,467
You're his only chance.

820
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:58,338
I would rather drop dead where I'm standing
than ever do another play with him.

821
00:47:58,408 --> 00:48:00,876
- It might be a smart bet for you.
- What?

822
00:48:00,944 --> 00:48:04,402
You go back and tell that fake Svengali
I wouldn't wipe my feet on him...

823
00:48:04,481 --> 00:48:08,577
- if he were starving, and I hope he is.
- That' s no way for you to talk. He made you.

824
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:11,246
He what? Get out of here.

825
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:14,518
- You've said enough.
- I thought you were a bigger woman, Lily...

826
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:18,288
- but I see I was deeply mistaken.
- Get out. Right outside.

827
00:48:20,697 --> 00:48:22,927
Well, we asked her.
Let' s tell the earth-shaker.

828
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,868
I thought I told you he fired me
for the last time, and I meant it.

829
00:48:32,009 --> 00:48:33,237
Come in.

830
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:37,975
Are you down, O.J.?

831
00:48:40,117 --> 00:48:41,641
And almost out.

832
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:44,881
What was the name of the minnesinger
who cracked about:

833
00:48:44,955 --> 00:48:47,480
"It' s always darkest before the dawn?"

834
00:48:47,991 --> 00:48:50,391
I don't know, Owen, but he was an ass.

835
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:53,759
Did you ever hear of a female
entitled Lily Garland?

836
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:56,061
Don't be humorous, Owen.

837
00:48:56,133 --> 00:49:00,570
O.J., suppose, just hypothetically,
of course, that you, Mr. Bromo...

838
00:49:00,637 --> 00:49:03,538
could get together again with Miss Seltzer.

839
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:09,444
I wouldn't take that woman back if she and I
were the last people in the world...

840
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:12,673
and the future of the human race
depended on it.

841
00:49:13,717 --> 00:49:16,015
Besides, she's 2,000 miles away.

842
00:49:16,086 --> 00:49:18,714
No, she ain't. She's right on this train.

843
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:25,451
- O'Malley, you're a liar.
- Okay, but she's right in there.

844
00:49:29,232 --> 00:49:32,793
- I wonder if she's doing this deliberately.
- I shouldn't think so offhand.

845
00:49:32,869 --> 00:49:35,064
- Owen, it' s a miracle.
- What?

846
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:37,038
She made the first move being here.

847
00:49:37,107 --> 00:49:40,634
I'll meet her halfway.
I'll make the supreme gesture.

848
00:49:40,711 --> 00:49:43,145
You mean you're going to let Lily
work for you again?

849
00:49:43,213 --> 00:49:44,874
How did you guess that?

850
00:49:44,948 --> 00:49:46,108
I'm going to forgive her.

851
00:49:46,183 --> 00:49:49,448
As a matter of fact, sire,
we've already broached the subject to her.

852
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:51,146
What did she say? Tell me everything.

853
00:49:51,221 --> 00:49:53,655
You know her. She screamed like a fishwife.

854
00:49:53,724 --> 00:49:56,249
That' s a good sign. She blew up?

855
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:59,494
That shows the battery isn't dead.

856
00:50:00,564 --> 00:50:03,692
Did you give her any false idea
about her being necessary to me?

857
00:50:03,767 --> 00:50:04,927
- Not a word.
- Are you sure?

858
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:06,936
We just talked
some good horse sense to her.

859
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:09,564
- That' s fine. Where's Oliver?
- You fired him.

860
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:12,233
He's taking advantage of that, is he?

861
00:50:12,743 --> 00:50:16,509
There are only two musketeers left.
Very well, we'll work all the harder.

862
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:19,913
I want you to send a wire to Maurice,
the florist in Toledo...

863
00:50:19,983 --> 00:50:23,510
and tell him to send every gardenia he has
in the shop to Drawing Room...

864
00:50:23,587 --> 00:50:26,283
- What' s the initial?
- "B" as in "bughouse."

865
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:28,548
Drawing Room B, this car.

866
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:30,957
There's a message
I want to go with those gardenias.

867
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:33,963
Take your pencil out, I'll give it to you.

868
00:50:34,431 --> 00:50:37,457
To my little Madonna of the snows.

869
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:40,128
No, wait a minute.
We won't use that this time.

870
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:42,899
Put that down, Owen, it' s very distracting.

871
00:50:42,973 --> 00:50:44,372
I've got it.

872
00:50:45,008 --> 00:50:48,500
From the grave of someone
you loved yesterday.

873
00:50:48,578 --> 00:50:50,978
- How's that?
- A little on the sad side, isn't it?

874
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:54,882
It' s perfect. Wish I could get playwrights
to write like that.

875
00:50:55,018 --> 00:50:57,452
Can I have a little sip now, O.J.?

876
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:00,182
So Oliver thought I was through, did he?

877
00:51:00,257 --> 00:51:01,884
It had all the earmarks of a crisis.

878
00:51:01,958 --> 00:51:05,223
That' s when I'm at my best,
with my back against the wall...

879
00:51:05,295 --> 00:51:07,729
disaster staring me in the face.

880
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:11,325
<i>Joan of Arc</i>, <i>The Bride of Bagdad</i>,
<i>Desert Love.</i>

881
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:14,962
No money, no credit.
My theater, everything gone.

882
00:51:16,139 --> 00:51:18,573
Everything but the name of Jaffe.

883
00:51:19,142 --> 00:51:20,734
They got me down.

884
00:51:20,811 --> 00:51:25,680
But I'm like a prizefighter who gets up at
the count of nine, staggers for a moment...

885
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:28,809
and then leads with the fury
of a wounded lion.

886
00:51:32,522 --> 00:51:35,218
You've seen me in action before.
I don't have to tell you.

887
00:51:35,292 --> 00:51:37,658
It' s been my privilege several times, sire.

888
00:51:37,727 --> 00:51:39,718
I'm going into action now.

889
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:43,293
Now don't interrupt us,
no matter what happens.

890
00:51:48,338 --> 00:51:51,136
Darling, remember that we love each other.

891
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:55,574
- Who is that?
- Who?

892
00:51:55,645 --> 00:51:57,613
That fellow kissing her.

893
00:51:58,715 --> 00:52:00,683
This is the final irony.

894
00:52:01,051 --> 00:52:03,144
Mousing around with boys...

895
00:52:04,221 --> 00:52:06,212
after Oscar Jaffe.

896
00:52:07,224 --> 00:52:09,920
I always knew she'd head for the gutter.

897
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:11,825
I can't stand it.

898
00:52:11,895 --> 00:52:15,023
My heart' s breaking. Conductor!

899
00:52:15,198 --> 00:52:18,793
Where's the conductor? Conductor!

900
00:52:19,936 --> 00:52:21,597
Come here, you.

901
00:52:21,671 --> 00:52:23,571
Who is that man with Lily?

902
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,870
- Who is he? What' s his name?
- I don't know.

903
00:52:25,942 --> 00:52:28,433
Yes, you do, you Mata Hari.

904
00:52:28,512 --> 00:52:31,481
- Is he going to New York with her?
- Is that my fault?

905
00:52:31,548 --> 00:52:33,448
- Mr. Jaffe.
- Did you hear that?

906
00:52:33,517 --> 00:52:36,714
There's a law in this country
about riding on trains.

907
00:52:36,786 --> 00:52:39,220
- I call on you to invoke it.
- What?

908
00:52:39,289 --> 00:52:43,316
Stop the train. I want that man
in Drawing Room B thrown off.

909
00:52:43,393 --> 00:52:47,227
- Nobody can stop this train.
- Oscar Jaffe's telling you to stop this train.

910
00:52:47,297 --> 00:52:50,858
Oscar Jaffe or no Oscar Jaffe.
Fires, floods, or blizzards...

911
00:52:50,934 --> 00:52:54,233
this is the 20th Century
and we get to New York on time.

912
00:52:54,304 --> 00:52:58,570
Now if you'll just go in and relax,
you'll feel much better, I'm sure.

913
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:02,004
<i>Kissing her.</i>

914
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:20,094
Come back here, you. Hold him, Flannagan.

915
00:53:20,163 --> 00:53:23,155
That' s not necessary, gentlemen.
I'm harmless.

916
00:53:23,233 --> 00:53:25,167
I'm a well-known businessman, Conductor.

917
00:53:25,235 --> 00:53:29,467
Here, that' s my line:
Sunshine Fruit Tablets. I'm President.

918
00:53:29,773 --> 00:53:31,798
I'll pay for anything I've done.

919
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:34,673
I'm so ashamed of myself, I can hardly talk.

920
00:53:34,744 --> 00:53:37,338
What' s the idea of running around
pasting those stickers?

921
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:41,043
- Did I put up many of them?
- Why, the place is plastered with them.

922
00:53:41,117 --> 00:53:42,141
Oh, dear.

923
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:44,153
- Is your name Mathew J. Clark?
- Yes, sir.

924
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:46,018
Got a wire here concerning you.

925
00:53:46,089 --> 00:53:48,387
- Is it from my nephew?
- It' s signed Harold Clark.

926
00:53:48,458 --> 00:53:52,918
Thas he. Does it convey the fact that
I'm a little crazy but perfectly harmless...

927
00:53:52,996 --> 00:53:55,157
and that he will meet me in Cleveland?

928
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:56,494
That' s right.

929
00:53:56,566 --> 00:54:00,161
It also says that you're in the habit
of passing out phony checks...

930
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:03,331
for large amounts
and not to accept any of them.

931
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:08,406
You nearly caused a panic among
the passengers. "The time is at hand."

932
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:10,739
They got to worrying
about a wreck or something.

933
00:54:10,814 --> 00:54:12,577
That' s terrible. Don't tell my nephew.

934
00:54:12,649 --> 00:54:15,447
- What did you do it for?
- I don't know.

935
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:17,949
It' s a sort of spiritual call.

936
00:54:18,021 --> 00:54:22,117
But I'm entirely normal now,
and if you'll allow me to go to my room...

937
00:54:22,192 --> 00:54:25,286
I give you my word of honor
not to cause you any more trouble.

938
00:54:25,362 --> 00:54:28,331
- How are you feeling?
- Fine.

939
00:54:28,398 --> 00:54:32,960
Entirely over it. It' s quite gone now.
Here, let me pay you for the trouble.

940
00:54:33,036 --> 00:54:37,234
No, we don't want your money,
but I'm sorry you've got this disease.

941
00:54:37,307 --> 00:54:40,242
Thank you very much.
Let me give you the rest of the stickers.

942
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:42,904
This whole thing is so humiliating to me.

943
00:54:42,979 --> 00:54:45,470
I just hope we can keep it
out of the newspapers.

944
00:54:45,548 --> 00:54:49,416
I'll take care of that. Remember, boys,
not a word about this to anybody.

945
00:54:49,486 --> 00:54:51,852
If you'll just go to your drawing room
and rest...

946
00:54:51,921 --> 00:54:53,616
I'm sure you'll be well taken care of.

947
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:56,420
The reason I'm taking you back
is on account of your wife.

948
00:54:56,493 --> 00:54:57,517
I see.

949
00:54:57,594 --> 00:55:00,893
No need to have the innocent
suffer with the guilty.

950
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:03,226
I have to change my plan of campaign.

951
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:07,031
The first thing to do
is to get rid of the lover, eliminate him.

952
00:55:07,103 --> 00:55:08,331
Now get out your pencil.

953
00:55:08,405 --> 00:55:12,466
We're going to draw up a contract
between Oscar Jaffe and Lily Garland.

954
00:55:12,575 --> 00:55:16,136
- O.J., stop chasing rainbows.
- Make it out in legal form.

955
00:55:16,279 --> 00:55:20,215
She's going to sign a contract with me
before she leaves this train.

956
00:55:20,283 --> 00:55:22,774
Listen, O.J., if you'll allow me to presume.

957
00:55:22,852 --> 00:55:25,082
- What now?
- Now I know this may cost me my job...

958
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:27,180
but if you ask me,
we're not getting anywhere.

959
00:55:27,257 --> 00:55:28,918
- What?
- What we need is a play...

960
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:32,553
something she can read, see herself
walking up and down the stage in.

961
00:55:32,629 --> 00:55:35,723
- I'll find a play.
- Where? You can't pull one out of a hat.

962
00:55:35,799 --> 00:55:40,736
I was born under the sign of Sagittarius.
That' s the archer.

963
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:43,563
You draw up that contract.

964
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:44,868
Wait a minute.

965
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,972
That may be Lily now.

966
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:49,406
Come in.

967
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:57,149
Excuse us, please.

968
00:55:57,654 --> 00:55:58,985
That' s him.

969
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:04,493
Maestro.

970
00:56:05,328 --> 00:56:07,853
- What is this?
- Now run along, we're busy.

971
00:56:07,931 --> 00:56:11,025
Stop that, Oliver.
You know I always see people.

972
00:56:11,501 --> 00:56:13,298
What is it you wish, gentlemen?

973
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:16,396
Maestro, this is a great honor.

974
00:56:19,909 --> 00:56:21,570
Spit it out.

975
00:56:21,644 --> 00:56:23,475
Maestro, I want to say...

976
00:56:26,149 --> 00:56:28,413
Maestro, perhaps...

977
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:30,652
you have seen us sometime.

978
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,415
Actors?

979
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:38,986
We are belonging to the Passion Play.

980
00:56:39,429 --> 00:56:42,057
- The Oberammergau players.
- <i>Ja.</i>

981
00:56:43,032 --> 00:56:45,193
I should have recognized you.

982
00:56:45,268 --> 00:56:49,068
The Oberammergau Players
are the purest branch of the theater.

983
00:56:49,472 --> 00:56:51,099
Oliver, stand up.

984
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:53,641
Hello, boys.

985
00:56:55,478 --> 00:56:58,038
They are the only true actors we have left.

986
00:56:58,114 --> 00:57:00,605
Not like our cheap Broadway hams.

987
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:03,746
They are devoted to their art from infancy.

988
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:05,185
Yeah, I see.

989
00:57:05,321 --> 00:57:08,722
- I am the Judas.
- He's the Judas and I am...

990
00:57:08,792 --> 00:57:11,955
Yes. Now, how do you boys
like the United States?

991
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:15,553
We don't like it so good.
We have had lots of troubles.

992
00:57:15,632 --> 00:57:19,033
Our manager has run away
with all our money.

993
00:57:19,636 --> 00:57:23,128
- And now you want to borrow some.
- Thank you. Yeah.

994
00:57:23,206 --> 00:57:26,437
You see, we got nothing to eat
till we get on the boat.

995
00:57:26,509 --> 00:57:28,204
- Moochers?
- <i>Ja.</i>

996
00:57:29,012 --> 00:57:30,172
I thought so.

997
00:57:30,246 --> 00:57:33,010
Sit down, gentlemen.

998
00:57:33,082 --> 00:57:35,516
Oliver, it' s an inspiration...

999
00:57:35,585 --> 00:57:38,986
at the eleventh hour,
with my back against the wall.

1000
00:57:39,055 --> 00:57:41,615
- How much money do you need, gentlemen?
- $54.

1001
00:57:41,691 --> 00:57:44,854
- Give it to them, Oliver.
- What? We don't even know these people.

1002
00:57:44,928 --> 00:57:48,830
While you were chatting over here,
my mind was active.

1003
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:52,862
The Passion Play:
the greatest drama of the ages.

1004
00:57:53,369 --> 00:57:56,600
At last I've found something
that is worthy of me.

1005
00:57:56,673 --> 00:57:59,369
O.J., can I speak to you a moment?
Come on, boys. Get out.

1006
00:57:59,442 --> 00:58:01,740
- O.J., I've got to speak to you alone.
- What?

1007
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:05,008
- Are you crazy?
- Never mind who's crazy.

1008
00:58:05,081 --> 00:58:06,878
Go on, boys, I'll attend to you later.

1009
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:08,941
I thought you were going to sign them up.

1010
00:58:09,018 --> 00:58:10,679
Of course I'm going to sign them up.

1011
00:58:10,753 --> 00:58:13,278
- Wait a minute, O.J.
- Call them back.

1012
00:58:13,423 --> 00:58:17,154
Now, O.J., I'm going to undertake
a terrible responsibility.

1013
00:58:17,293 --> 00:58:20,023
Now, I know you won't believe me...

1014
00:58:20,096 --> 00:58:24,430
but I'm more than just an employee.
I'm the best friend you've got on earth.

1015
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:27,436
Now, go easy, Oliver. Remember your heart.

1016
00:58:28,638 --> 00:58:31,368
I'm not going to let you do it.
You've done enough.

1017
00:58:31,441 --> 00:58:34,239
I'm not going to let you get mixed up
with any phony art.

1018
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:35,834
Now the trouble with you is...

1019
00:58:35,912 --> 00:58:39,245
you don't know whas happened
to the public in the last three years.

1020
00:58:39,315 --> 00:58:41,408
I'll tell you. I know.

1021
00:58:41,484 --> 00:58:44,453
I've had my ear to the ground like an Indian.

1022
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:48,048
This is what they want
and I'm going to give it to them.

1023
00:58:49,425 --> 00:58:53,828
At least we won't have to worry about
any goose chase with Lily Garland.

1024
00:58:54,063 --> 00:58:58,056
Of course I want it for her.
Why else do you suppose I got it?

1025
00:58:58,134 --> 00:59:01,069
- The Passion Play?
- It fits her like a glove.

1026
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:05,004
What a Magdalene she'll make.
Is a perfect piece of casting.

1027
00:59:05,174 --> 00:59:08,302
Wait till I tell her.
Oliver, our troubles are over.

1028
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:10,039
Oh, are they?

1029
00:59:10,446 --> 00:59:14,246
Where are you going to get $250,000
to produce a spectacle like that?

1030
00:59:14,517 --> 00:59:16,610
By waving your magic wand?

1031
00:59:16,986 --> 00:59:20,513
Don't talk about money matters now, Oliver.
Do you mind?

1032
00:59:20,823 --> 00:59:22,950
I don't care if it kills me.

1033
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:44,844
- Is it all right for you to be out here?
- Yes, thank you, porter. I'm quite all right.

1034
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:49,146
Yes, but the boys are having an awful time
getting those things down.

1035
01:00:03,866 --> 01:00:05,857
Porter, have you got any
bicarbonate of soda?

1036
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:08,529
- Yes, sir.
- Get me some in a hurry.

1037
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:12,598
- lf you are in distress, I have just the thing.
- No, thank you.

1038
01:00:12,976 --> 01:00:15,968
You're in the theatrical business,
aren't you?

1039
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:20,245
I've often thought I'd like to devote myself
to the theater.

1040
01:00:20,316 --> 01:00:22,784
Would you think there might be
a place for me?

1041
01:00:22,852 --> 01:00:24,114
Oh, yes.

1042
01:00:24,187 --> 01:00:27,918
- Probably fill a long-felt want.
- That' s what I thought.

1043
01:00:27,991 --> 01:00:31,188
It might solve my financial difficulties, too.

1044
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:34,889
You know, when one has
so much cash lying around...

1045
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:38,832
it becomes a problem how to invest it,
don't you think?

1046
01:00:38,901 --> 01:00:41,495
I have terrible headaches just thinking of it.

1047
01:00:41,571 --> 01:00:43,596
That' s too bad.

1048
01:00:43,673 --> 01:00:45,664
Why, you haven't taken your tablet yet.

1049
01:00:45,742 --> 01:00:48,176
- They're really very good.
- Thank you.

1050
01:00:48,244 --> 01:00:50,109
I manufacture them myself.

1051
01:00:50,179 --> 01:00:53,080
That' s our ad in the <i>Saturday Evening Post.</i>

1052
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:55,174
- This is your ad?
- Yes.

1053
01:00:55,251 --> 01:00:58,152
We're one of their biggest advertisers.

1054
01:00:58,221 --> 01:00:59,984
Well.

1055
01:01:01,457 --> 01:01:05,257
- And your name is...
- Clark. Mathew J. Clark.

1056
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:07,391
You see, Mr. Clark...

1057
01:01:07,463 --> 01:01:10,694
in the theatrical business,
there are no headaches.

1058
01:01:10,767 --> 01:01:13,531
- No?
- Oh, no.

1059
01:01:13,603 --> 01:01:15,127
Is that so?

1060
01:01:30,953 --> 01:01:33,547
George, why haven't you ever asked me
to marry you?

1061
01:01:33,623 --> 01:01:36,524
What? I'd no idea that you'd be interested.

1062
01:01:37,326 --> 01:01:39,055
George, let' s elope.

1063
01:01:39,128 --> 01:01:41,426
Why elope? There's no one stopping us.

1064
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:43,192
- Hurry, Owen.
- I'm coming.

1065
01:01:43,266 --> 01:01:45,131
- Come on.
- I'm coming.

1066
01:01:45,868 --> 01:01:47,495
What is it, sire?

1067
01:01:48,771 --> 01:01:53,265
We're before Waterloo
with Sheridan 20 miles away...

1068
01:01:53,976 --> 01:01:55,967
but we can't wait for that now.

1069
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:59,276
- Stand by, Owen.
- What' s the program, Richelieu?

1070
01:01:59,348 --> 01:02:02,181
- Where's Oliver?
- He's probably hiding. Who can blame him?

1071
01:02:02,251 --> 01:02:04,845
Here. Help me out with this. Hurry up.

1072
01:02:04,921 --> 01:02:07,253
- Tie it back of me.
- What for?

1073
01:02:07,523 --> 01:02:09,821
This is a little bit of strategy...

1074
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:13,123
in case that young ruffian in there
gets violent.

1075
01:02:13,529 --> 01:02:15,121
Hold yourself in readiness.

1076
01:02:15,198 --> 01:02:16,995
What are you going to do?

1077
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:21,101
I have got to break a human heart.

1078
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:29,874
How little you know
the real Lily Garland, George.

1079
01:02:29,946 --> 01:02:33,404
I've died so often,
made love so much on the stage...

1080
01:02:33,483 --> 01:02:35,508
that I've lost track of what' s real.

1081
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:38,179
What is real?

1082
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:42,547
A house,
a home with a little attic and a cookie jar...

1083
01:02:42,625 --> 01:02:47,255
and a doorstep,
and little feet, pattering up and down.

1084
01:02:51,968 --> 01:02:56,098
I thought it was your voice, Lily.
I just came to say hello.

1085
01:02:56,239 --> 01:02:58,503
I don't want to talk to you, Oscar. Please go.

1086
01:02:58,574 --> 01:03:01,975
I've nothing to say to you. I don't want
to hear anything you've to say.

1087
01:03:02,044 --> 01:03:04,740
I'm warning you
about bothering Miss Garland, and I mean it.

1088
01:03:04,814 --> 01:03:06,111
No violence, George. He'll go.

1089
01:03:06,182 --> 01:03:07,809
- Let me attend to this.
- No. Sit down.

1090
01:03:07,884 --> 01:03:10,352
- He's got to get out.
- A public fight would finish me.

1091
01:03:10,419 --> 01:03:12,853
He'd love to splash our names
on the front pages.

1092
01:03:12,922 --> 01:03:14,651
Let him throw me out, Lily.

1093
01:03:14,724 --> 01:03:16,658
It would be the final irony.

1094
01:03:16,726 --> 01:03:19,194
I came here out of a gallant mood...

1095
01:03:19,595 --> 01:03:20,892
to congratulate you.

1096
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:23,989
And you can get right out again.
You've no right here.

1097
01:03:24,333 --> 01:03:27,302
No right? Doesn't he know about us?

1098
01:03:28,004 --> 01:03:29,733
I thought everybody knew.

1099
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:32,138
It was one of the great romances
of our time.

1100
01:03:32,208 --> 01:03:34,472
- You...
- I broke it in Chicago.

1101
01:03:36,412 --> 01:03:39,904
All right, Oscar.
You've done your usual slimy trick.

1102
01:03:39,982 --> 01:03:43,145
You could never stand to see anything
sweet or decent in my life.

1103
01:03:43,219 --> 01:03:45,881
You couldn't wait to come in here
and blab everything.

1104
01:03:46,422 --> 01:03:49,448
Blab? I'm proud of every hour
that we've spent together.

1105
01:03:49,525 --> 01:03:51,823
So should you be. What' s happened to you?

1106
01:03:51,894 --> 01:03:55,830
- Are you trying to hoodwink this child?
- I gave you your chance.

1107
01:03:55,898 --> 01:03:59,459
Stop! Don't start hammering at me.
I can't stand it.

1108
01:03:59,535 --> 01:04:01,696
Comfort her, sir. Is your privilege.

1109
01:04:01,771 --> 01:04:04,740
Lying to me.
Every minute with every breath, lying to me.

1110
01:04:04,807 --> 01:04:08,038
Yes. I tried to save you pain.
I lied, yes, only to save you.

1111
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:09,941
- That' s from Sappho.
- Get out!

1112
01:04:10,012 --> 01:04:12,173
I hate him! I say it right to his face.

1113
01:04:12,248 --> 01:04:15,513
I loathe and despise him.
I hate the ground he walks on.

1114
01:04:15,585 --> 01:04:17,951
He's part of something horrible in my life.

1115
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:20,250
George, don't leave me with him.

1116
01:04:29,732 --> 01:04:32,166
What an exit. Not a word.

1117
01:04:32,335 --> 01:04:35,133
Thas what we should have had
in <i>The Heart of Kentucky...</i>

1118
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:37,468
when Michael leaves Mary Jo in the first act.

1119
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:41,135
Go and crawl back under your stone
or wherever you came from.

1120
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:43,804
I'll be back in a few minutes
with a little surprise.

1121
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:47,077
Something I've been promising you
for seven years.

1122
01:04:47,783 --> 01:04:50,217
Owen, I've just played a scene.

1123
01:04:50,286 --> 01:04:52,311
Sardou might have written it.

1124
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:56,017
I have her in the perfect mood,
and we must strike at once.

1125
01:04:56,158 --> 01:04:58,251
Where's Oliver with that contract?

1126
01:04:58,327 --> 01:05:00,921
Let' s hurry. Come on. We've got to get at it.

1127
01:05:08,170 --> 01:05:10,764
- You're back all ready to forgive me.
- No.

1128
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:12,671
I don't care to be forgiven by you.

1129
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:14,209
You won't be. I came for my hat.

1130
01:05:14,277 --> 01:05:17,542
- Get it and get out.
- It happens that you're sitting on it.

1131
01:05:18,481 --> 01:05:20,779
Why do people keep hammering at me?

1132
01:05:20,850 --> 01:05:22,545
Hammering and hammering...

1133
01:05:22,618 --> 01:05:26,281
- You're hysterical.
- It happens I'm as calm as a fish.

1134
01:05:26,355 --> 01:05:29,381
Lying to me. Swearing on your love
and honor. You're a fake.

1135
01:05:29,458 --> 01:05:30,584
I'm a fake?

1136
01:05:33,296 --> 01:05:34,729
What are you laughing at?

1137
01:05:34,797 --> 01:05:37,095
- I'll tell you. I have lied to you.
- What?

1138
01:05:37,166 --> 01:05:40,897
All those opera tenors, acrobats,
that Italian bicycle rider I told you about.

1139
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:42,904
They're all lies. The only man in my life...

1140
01:05:42,972 --> 01:05:46,237
- was that cavalier in there, Oscar Jaffe.
- What are you telling me?

1141
01:05:46,309 --> 01:05:48,504
- I was completely loyal to him.
- Loyal?

1142
01:05:48,577 --> 01:05:50,875
Of course. He watched me like a hawk.

1143
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:52,710
And you wanted my respect.

1144
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:56,013
Who cares about your respect?
I'm too big to be respected.

1145
01:05:56,085 --> 01:05:57,985
Men I've known have understood that.

1146
01:05:58,054 --> 01:06:00,181
- Men you've known? Jaffe, you mean.
- Yes, Jaffe.

1147
01:06:00,256 --> 01:06:03,851
He'll tell you what I am:
a first-class passenger entitled to privileges.

1148
01:06:03,926 --> 01:06:05,450
Oh, an artist.

1149
01:06:05,528 --> 01:06:08,088
You're darned tooting I am.

1150
01:06:08,931 --> 01:06:10,125
George, you bore me.

1151
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:12,292
Don't worry. It won't be for long.

1152
01:06:12,368 --> 01:06:16,031
My last words to you are that I hate you.
I despise you.

1153
01:06:16,272 --> 01:06:17,899
Now get out of...

1154
01:06:19,108 --> 01:06:22,908
Why do they keep hammering at me?
Hammering and hammering...

1155
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:25,777
- Sadie, I'm all...
- Come on.

1156
01:06:25,848 --> 01:06:28,009
Give me my makeup. Stop pushing me.

1157
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:33,318
Come on, Owen. We've got to find that.

1158
01:06:36,759 --> 01:06:39,387
That eliminates the lover. Come on, Owen.

1159
01:06:40,429 --> 01:06:42,260
Get Oliver with that contract.

1160
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:46,392
I'll do my best, sire, but we've
crossed the river and I've lost the scent.

1161
01:06:49,071 --> 01:06:50,368
Hello, Sadie.

1162
01:06:50,473 --> 01:06:53,203
I'm surprised
you haven't been around to see me.

1163
01:06:53,442 --> 01:06:54,966
Same old rosy cheeks.

1164
01:06:55,544 --> 01:06:57,603
Miss Garland is taking a nap.

1165
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:00,706
Poor child. No one understands her.

1166
01:07:01,484 --> 01:07:05,045
Now listen, Sadie. Always take care of her.
Promise me that.

1167
01:07:05,121 --> 01:07:07,715
She's very delicate. I think I'll sit.

1168
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:11,057
I'm sorry if I woke you up.

1169
01:07:11,127 --> 01:07:13,857
- Get out of here, Sadie.
- He sneaked in through that door.

1170
01:07:13,929 --> 01:07:16,420
I know. I'll call you if I need you.

1171
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:19,591
What do you want, scorpion?

1172
01:07:20,536 --> 01:07:24,063
If it makes you any happier
to call me names, go ahead.

1173
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:25,698
Oscar, you're complete.

1174
01:07:25,775 --> 01:07:29,711
The most horrible excuse for a human being
that ever walked on two legs.

1175
01:07:30,312 --> 01:07:32,803
You've always misunderstood me, Lily.

1176
01:07:32,915 --> 01:07:36,442
No matter what I said, if he'd been a lover...

1177
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:38,084
a real man...

1178
01:07:38,287 --> 01:07:41,848
he'd have taken you in his arms,
he'd have been tender.

1179
01:07:42,124 --> 01:07:44,957
Instead of that, he stalked out of the room...

1180
01:07:45,494 --> 01:07:49,260
like a Reverend Henry Davidson in <i>Rain.</i>

1181
01:07:51,801 --> 01:07:55,362
Your philosophy of love doesn't interest me,
Mr. Jaffe.

1182
01:07:55,838 --> 01:07:58,671
I wish I could dismiss it like that, but I can't.

1183
01:07:58,841 --> 01:08:03,039
When I love a woman, I'm an Oriental.
It never goes. It never dies.

1184
01:08:03,345 --> 01:08:04,471
Phooey.

1185
01:08:05,514 --> 01:08:10,076
Love blinded me. That was the trouble
between us as producer and artist.

1186
01:08:10,653 --> 01:08:12,814
So thas what it was, was it?

1187
01:08:12,888 --> 01:08:15,914
How about your name in electric lights
bigger than everybody's...

1188
01:08:15,991 --> 01:08:17,959
your delusion
that you were a Shakespeare...

1189
01:08:18,027 --> 01:08:21,394
and a Napoleon and a Grand Lama of Tibet
all rolled into one.

1190
01:08:21,464 --> 01:08:23,193
- You're absolutely right.
- What?

1191
01:08:23,265 --> 01:08:24,732
I'm big enough to admit it.

1192
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:27,860
I never appreciated your real greatness
till I lost you.

1193
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:30,667
How small, how cheap,
what egotism not to know...

1194
01:08:30,739 --> 01:08:34,300
that it was Lily Garland
instead of Oscar Jaffe that really mattered.

1195
01:08:34,376 --> 01:08:36,003
When you ran around telling people...

1196
01:08:36,078 --> 01:08:39,241
that you put chalk marks on the stage
so I'd know where to stand...

1197
01:08:39,315 --> 01:08:41,442
that you had to teach me to talk,
like a parrot.

1198
01:08:41,517 --> 01:08:42,609
It was despicable.

1199
01:08:42,685 --> 01:08:46,451
- I could cut my throat.
- If you did, greasepaint would run out of it.

1200
01:08:49,925 --> 01:08:52,894
That' s the trouble with you, Oscar,
with both of us.

1201
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:55,260
We're not people. We're lithographs.

1202
01:08:55,331 --> 01:08:59,233
We don't know anything about love
unless is written and rehearsed.

1203
01:08:59,335 --> 01:09:01,530
We're only real in between curtains.

1204
01:09:06,475 --> 01:09:08,943
- Why, Lily, you're crying.
- Sure.

1205
01:09:09,411 --> 01:09:12,209
I turn on a faucet. It' s that sort of scene.

1206
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:15,678
- That' s the devil of it.
- That' s the pity of it, you mean.

1207
01:09:15,751 --> 01:09:20,347
Those movies you were in, a sacrilege
throwing you away on things like that.

1208
01:09:20,523 --> 01:09:22,354
When I left that movie house...

1209
01:09:22,424 --> 01:09:26,827
I felt some magnificent ruby
had been thrown into a platter of lard.

1210
01:09:26,962 --> 01:09:30,557
You put yourself back 10 years,
but we can mend all that.

1211
01:09:30,633 --> 01:09:32,533
You'll be greater than ever, Lily Garland.

1212
01:09:32,601 --> 01:09:34,330
Listen, if all this adagio is...

1213
01:09:34,403 --> 01:09:37,497
by any chance preliminary to a contract,
you can save your breath.

1214
01:09:37,573 --> 01:09:39,666
- Contract?
- What are you talking about?

1215
01:09:39,742 --> 01:09:42,108
You'd give anything
to get my name on a contract.

1216
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:44,908
I came in here with a dream
we both had long ago:

1217
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:47,175
the last step of the golden stair.

1218
01:09:47,650 --> 01:09:50,915
The courtesan, the great courtesan role.

1219
01:09:50,986 --> 01:09:53,011
"Look out. Look out."

1220
01:09:53,088 --> 01:09:54,487
What is it this time...

1221
01:09:54,557 --> 01:09:58,254
the big drama about Hairpin Annie,
the pride of the gashouse?

1222
01:09:59,962 --> 01:10:01,395
No, Lily.

1223
01:10:01,497 --> 01:10:05,058
This happens to be
about the greatest woman of all time.

1224
01:10:05,167 --> 01:10:07,192
Just her memory...

1225
01:10:07,269 --> 01:10:10,602
has kept the world weeping for centuries.

1226
01:10:11,674 --> 01:10:15,132
- The Magdalene.
- You mean that play by Sudermann?

1227
01:10:16,078 --> 01:10:18,945
Sudermann? That German hack?

1228
01:10:19,014 --> 01:10:22,142
Listen to me. I'm going to put on
the Passion Play in New York...

1229
01:10:22,218 --> 01:10:23,742
with Lily Garland as the Magdalene.

1230
01:10:23,819 --> 01:10:27,084
I've had it up my sleeve all this time,
waiting for the right moment.

1231
01:10:27,156 --> 01:10:29,021
The wickedest woman of her age...

1232
01:10:29,091 --> 01:10:31,184
sensual, heartless...

1233
01:10:31,327 --> 01:10:34,592
but beautiful,
corrupting everything she touches...

1234
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:38,991
running the gamut from the gutter to glory.
Can you see her, Lily?

1235
01:10:39,134 --> 01:10:40,624
This little wanton...

1236
01:10:42,137 --> 01:10:45,436
ending up in tears at the foot of the cross.

1237
01:10:46,775 --> 01:10:50,541
I'm going to have Judas
strangle himself with her hair.

1238
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:53,810
No, wait.

1239
01:10:53,882 --> 01:10:56,851
Why not have Judas drink the poison
that was intended for me?

1240
01:10:56,919 --> 01:11:00,548
Lily, that' s an inspiration. Go on,
while you're in the creative mood.

1241
01:11:00,623 --> 01:11:03,057
I'll tell you how I can see the whole thing.

1242
01:11:03,125 --> 01:11:04,422
I can see the Magdalene...

1243
01:11:04,493 --> 01:11:07,087
as a woman who was an aristocrat
at the beginning...

1244
01:11:07,162 --> 01:11:11,155
and after being heartbroken
by some man she loved madly and trusted...

1245
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:13,395
she went down...

1246
01:11:13,636 --> 01:11:15,331
down...

1247
01:11:15,404 --> 01:11:17,065
Into the depths.

1248
01:11:17,206 --> 01:11:21,802
Hating and despising all men.
Laughing at them, so cruel, so terrible.

1249
01:11:22,011 --> 01:11:25,845
Lily, if this play runs for five years,
I won't make a dollar.

1250
01:11:26,148 --> 01:11:30,346
You can have all the money.
All I want to do is to stagger New York.

1251
01:11:30,552 --> 01:11:33,180
A desert scene, with a hundred camels.

1252
01:11:35,691 --> 01:11:38,888
And real sand, brought from the Holy Land.

1253
01:11:39,028 --> 01:11:42,327
I'm going to have a Babylonian banquet
with your slaves around you.

1254
01:11:42,398 --> 01:11:47,028
You're covered in emeralds in that scene,
from head to foot, and nothing else.

1255
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:51,267
Suddenly you catch sight
of your greatest menace...

1256
01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:52,932
the soothsayer.

1257
01:11:55,010 --> 01:11:56,375
$40 a week.

1258
01:11:56,445 --> 01:11:59,778
Nevertheless, you go directly into
your snake dance.

1259
01:12:00,049 --> 01:12:04,782
It' s terrific, but it' s nothing compared
to the finish, where you stand in rags...

1260
01:12:05,321 --> 01:12:08,916
and the Emperor Nero himself
offers you half his empire.

1261
01:12:09,224 --> 01:12:12,193
You answer him
with one of the greatest speeches...

1262
01:12:12,261 --> 01:12:15,355
ever written in the history of literature...

1263
01:12:15,497 --> 01:12:18,125
with all the lights pouring down on you...

1264
01:12:18,233 --> 01:12:21,691
transfigured by love and sacrifice.

1265
01:12:22,104 --> 01:12:26,097
And the last we see of you
is this pathetic little figure...

1266
01:12:26,542 --> 01:12:29,136
selling olives in the...

1267
01:12:33,148 --> 01:12:36,117
- What' s the matter with you?
- You're crazy.

1268
01:12:36,485 --> 01:12:37,918
What do you mean?

1269
01:12:38,053 --> 01:12:41,989
Coming in here
with camels and sand from the Holy Land.

1270
01:12:42,057 --> 01:12:43,649
You're a scream.

1271
01:12:43,726 --> 01:12:46,854
You're gonna put on the Passion Play.
Oh, my heavens!

1272
01:12:46,962 --> 01:12:48,486
You haven't $100 to your name.

1273
01:12:48,564 --> 01:12:50,498
But I can raise a million, two million.

1274
01:12:50,566 --> 01:12:54,024
Yes, and I know how you intend to raise it.
Get my name on a contract...

1275
01:12:54,103 --> 01:12:56,867
shake down some new angel
on the strength of my reputation.

1276
01:12:56,939 --> 01:12:59,840
No, thank you.
I'm through being your meal ticket.

1277
01:12:59,908 --> 01:13:02,103
It' s a lie.
You've been listening to my enemies.

1278
01:13:02,177 --> 01:13:05,112
I listened to Mr. Oliver Webb,
who told me some sob story...

1279
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:08,081
that you were gonna commit suicide
unless I took pity on you.

1280
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:11,142
Go and commit it! It would be a blessing
to everybody concerned.

1281
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:15,054
What the... Mr. Webb? He is
no longer with me. I fired him for stealing.

1282
01:13:15,124 --> 01:13:17,319
Shut up. I've had enough of your lies.

1283
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:20,658
I'm offering you a last chance
to become immortal.

1284
01:13:20,796 --> 01:13:24,391
Thanks. I've decided to stay mortal
with a responsible management.

1285
01:13:24,733 --> 01:13:26,394
- Who?
- Max Jacobs.

1286
01:13:27,369 --> 01:13:30,065
- I can't believe it.
- No? Read the papers tomorrow, then.

1287
01:13:30,139 --> 01:13:34,439
- Why do you think I left Hollywood?
- Max Jacobs. He's a thief, illiterate.

1288
01:13:34,643 --> 01:13:36,543
He can hardly write his own name.

1289
01:13:36,612 --> 01:13:40,139
He writes it on checks all right,
great big checks, too.

1290
01:13:41,383 --> 01:13:43,476
So that' s what it is, money.

1291
01:13:43,619 --> 01:13:47,487
If I jingled $10,000 or $15,000
in front of your nose...

1292
01:13:47,556 --> 01:13:51,458
your mouth would begin to water.
You'd start drooling and squealing:

1293
01:13:51,527 --> 01:13:53,757
- "Give me!"
- That' s right, Oscar.

1294
01:13:53,896 --> 01:13:56,763
Now get out before I have the porter
throw you off the train.

1295
01:13:56,832 --> 01:14:01,394
We'll see who's gonna be thrown off
this train. Traveling with a gigolo.

1296
01:14:01,603 --> 01:14:04,265
Get off, you fake, you swindler!

1297
01:14:04,339 --> 01:14:07,638
Stop that, you cheap little shop girl!

1298
01:14:07,709 --> 01:14:11,076
- Get out before I call the conductor!
- Call the conductor!

1299
01:14:11,313 --> 01:14:14,749
- I'll tell the world who's a fake. You are!
- Get away from me!

1300
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:17,876
I taught you everything you know,
even your name!

1301
01:14:18,187 --> 01:14:20,314
Lily Garland, I gave you that.

1302
01:14:20,989 --> 01:14:24,288
As there's justice in heaven,
Mildred Plotka...

1303
01:14:24,359 --> 01:14:26,953
you will end up where you belong...

1304
01:14:27,029 --> 01:14:28,963
in the burlesque houses.

1305
01:14:29,031 --> 01:14:30,259
Get out of here!

1306
01:14:30,332 --> 01:14:33,358
- You coward.
- Who's a coward? You!

1307
01:14:34,069 --> 01:14:35,058
Owen.

1308
01:14:35,637 --> 01:14:39,733
Where's that scoundrel, Webb?
Selling me out behind my back.

1309
01:14:39,808 --> 01:14:42,140
I'll strangle him with these bare hands...

1310
01:14:42,211 --> 01:14:44,577
so help me, if I go to the chair for it.

1311
01:14:44,646 --> 01:14:45,380
- O.J.
- Come in, you gray rat.

1312
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:47,177
- O.J.
- Come in, you gray rat.

1313
01:14:47,649 --> 01:14:51,244
Do you know who I've got with me?
Mathew J. Clark, the patent medicine king.

1314
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:54,289
I've talked him into financing the play
from a religious angle.

1315
01:14:54,356 --> 01:14:56,415
You can write your own ticket. Millions.

1316
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:59,359
- Where is he?
- Just outside the door.

1317
01:14:59,528 --> 01:15:00,688
Show him in.

1318
01:15:02,731 --> 01:15:04,528
Come in, Mr. Clark.

1319
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:07,157
- Mr. Jaffe, Mr. Clark.
- How do you do, sir?

1320
01:15:07,302 --> 01:15:10,396
Mr. Webb has told me
all about you and your work.

1321
01:15:10,806 --> 01:15:15,038
- I'm glad to meet a noble and pious man.
- That' s very kind of you, sir.

1322
01:15:15,210 --> 01:15:19,442
It' s unusual to find a man of your profession
interested in religion.

1323
01:15:19,848 --> 01:15:22,248
What is your denomination?

1324
01:15:30,726 --> 01:15:34,218
I'm proud and happy to say, sir,
that I am a Baptist.

1325
01:15:36,865 --> 01:15:38,594
Will you sit down, please?

1326
01:15:44,306 --> 01:15:47,241
You got some more telegraph blanks?
I want to send another one.

1327
01:15:47,309 --> 01:15:51,268
To John Ringling.
I'm in the market for 25 camels...

1328
01:15:51,446 --> 01:15:53,607
several elephants, and an ibis.

1329
01:15:53,682 --> 01:15:56,583
- A what?
- That is the royal bird of Egypt.

1330
01:15:56,652 --> 01:15:58,279
Give me the rock-bottom price.

1331
01:15:58,353 --> 01:16:00,548
And sign it Oscar Jaffe. Right. Go ahead.

1332
01:16:00,622 --> 01:16:02,146
Say, O. J...

1333
01:16:02,357 --> 01:16:04,757
where are you gonna
house these monsters?

1334
01:16:04,826 --> 01:16:08,455
I'm going to construct a small zoo
next to the green room.

1335
01:16:08,997 --> 01:16:11,295
I wish I knew
the name of the Sultan of Turkey.

1336
01:16:11,366 --> 01:16:14,597
- I don't suppose you know it, do you?
- No. Not offhand.

1337
01:16:14,670 --> 01:16:17,434
What sort of didos are you casting him for?

1338
01:16:17,506 --> 01:16:21,033
I don't want him, you fool.
I want his dervishes, the whirling ones.

1339
01:16:21,109 --> 01:16:23,737
I want a dozen of them.
Now go and get his address.

1340
01:16:23,812 --> 01:16:25,939
I'll go and ask the conductor.

1341
01:16:26,014 --> 01:16:30,576
Owen, something tells me you're
not educated enough for this sort of thing.

1342
01:16:30,852 --> 01:16:33,787
- I'll have to hire some professor.
- Save your dough, sire.

1343
01:16:33,855 --> 01:16:36,449
I yield the lamp of learning to no one.

1344
01:16:37,059 --> 01:16:39,220
Owen, did you see Lily?

1345
01:16:39,361 --> 01:16:43,525
- I harped on that check for a half an hour.
- Go get her, Owen. Don't fail me.

1346
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:46,568
I'll bring her if I have to bring her
on a stretcher.

1347
01:16:46,835 --> 01:16:49,827
- Where are you going, Owen?
- I'm detouring over the Alps again.

1348
01:16:49,905 --> 01:16:53,306
- How did you get on, O.J.?
- Listen, I want to tell you something.

1349
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:54,899
I don't quite trust that man.

1350
01:16:54,977 --> 01:16:57,673
I want you to get off at Cleveland
and cash that check...

1351
01:16:57,746 --> 01:16:59,441
so I can give Lily her pound of flesh.

1352
01:16:59,514 --> 01:17:01,175
Get out your pen so I can endorse it.

1353
01:17:01,249 --> 01:17:03,513
I'm not bragging,
but I'd just like to point out...

1354
01:17:03,585 --> 01:17:06,315
that little Oliver Webb delivers in a pinch.

1355
01:17:06,388 --> 01:17:09,983
I'm thinking of promoting you, Oliver.
We'll have to get you a secretary...

1356
01:17:10,058 --> 01:17:13,824
a little fat one that you can boss around
all by yourself.

1357
01:17:14,129 --> 01:17:16,097
You're not bad-looking, you know...

1358
01:17:16,164 --> 01:17:17,756
if you'd only burn that hat.

1359
01:17:17,833 --> 01:17:20,961
Now run along, Oliver, and leave me alone.
I'm very busy.

1360
01:17:21,036 --> 01:17:22,594
It' s outrageous, that' s what it is.

1361
01:17:22,671 --> 01:17:25,105
- But it isn't the conductor's fault.
- What happened?

1362
01:17:25,173 --> 01:17:27,437
We were sitting here,
and for no reason at all...

1363
01:17:27,509 --> 01:17:30,774
this horrible old man rushed in
and stuck this sticker on the window.

1364
01:17:30,846 --> 01:17:32,336
- He's loose again.
- Did you see him?

1365
01:17:32,414 --> 01:17:35,406
No, sir, he's just up and down
with those stickers like a ghost.

1366
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:37,577
Our lives aren't safe
with this creature loose.

1367
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:40,952
Don't worry. They're taking him off
at Cleveland. We'll be there soon.

1368
01:17:41,023 --> 01:17:42,149
I can't find him anywhere.

1369
01:17:42,224 --> 01:17:44,556
All right, keep on the job.
You take these people...

1370
01:17:44,626 --> 01:17:47,117
into their car and see
that they're well taken care of.

1371
01:17:47,195 --> 01:17:49,959
<i>Happy days are here again</i>

1372
01:17:50,032 --> 01:17:52,057
<i>Happy days are here</i>

1373
01:17:52,134 --> 01:17:53,692
Is that a new one?

1374
01:17:53,869 --> 01:17:55,928
No, same one.
Just had it cleaned and blacked.

1375
01:17:56,004 --> 01:17:57,562
Personally, I prefer a derby.

1376
01:17:57,639 --> 01:18:00,403
- No, I mean the sticker.
- Same one.

1377
01:18:00,742 --> 01:18:03,074
<i>Happy days are here</i>

1378
01:18:03,145 --> 01:18:04,578
Say, we're on time, aren't we?

1379
01:18:04,646 --> 01:18:07,945
Yes. He's not causing Mr. Jaffe any trouble,
is he?

1380
01:18:08,016 --> 01:18:09,040
Who?

1381
01:18:09,117 --> 01:18:12,553
- The gentleman in Drawing Room D.
- Mr. Clark? Not at all.

1382
01:18:12,721 --> 01:18:14,416
<i>Happy days are here</i>

1383
01:18:14,489 --> 01:18:16,252
I see you know his name all right.

1384
01:18:16,324 --> 01:18:18,724
Do you happen to know where he's hiding?

1385
01:18:19,361 --> 01:18:20,521
No, I don't.

1386
01:18:21,129 --> 01:18:22,391
Who are you talking about?

1387
01:18:22,464 --> 01:18:23,931
Mr. Clark.

1388
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:27,298
I've looked over every inch of this train.
I can't find him.

1389
01:18:29,838 --> 01:18:30,998
Who's after him?

1390
01:18:31,073 --> 01:18:34,668
We're trying to keep it undercover,
but it' s a pretty sad case all around.

1391
01:18:35,243 --> 01:18:36,369
What are you talking about?

1392
01:18:36,445 --> 01:18:38,640
Clark. He's the one
putting up these stickers.

1393
01:18:38,714 --> 01:18:40,978
- It' s an infamous lie.
- I'm not going to argue...

1394
01:18:41,049 --> 01:18:43,279
but we caught him red-handed.
Here, read this.

1395
01:18:43,351 --> 01:18:46,787
If you happen to run into him again,
just engage him in conversation...

1396
01:18:46,855 --> 01:18:48,755
and don't let on that you know he's crazy.

1397
01:18:48,824 --> 01:18:51,190
Don't be frightened
because he's perfectly harmless.

1398
01:18:51,259 --> 01:18:54,922
Come on, Bob, we'll go through this train
with a fine-toothed comb.

1399
01:18:59,935 --> 01:19:03,598
I don't know, Owen.
Signing another contract with Oscar is like...

1400
01:19:03,672 --> 01:19:06,402
Come on. Pull yourself together.
Here's the historic quill.

1401
01:19:06,475 --> 01:19:08,340
Look out! You're ruining my negligee.

1402
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:10,139
Owen, it' s like jumping off a cliff.

1403
01:19:10,212 --> 01:19:13,045
What are you saying?
That' s not a contract. It' s a coronation.

1404
01:19:13,115 --> 01:19:15,640
Barrels of rubies,
carpets for your pretty feet...

1405
01:19:15,717 --> 01:19:18,686
onyx bathtubs,
slews of myrmidons at your beck and call.

1406
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:20,051
No, that' s not what I mean.

1407
01:19:20,122 --> 01:19:22,181
Come on,
sign it now while the sap is flowing.

1408
01:19:22,257 --> 01:19:25,488
Wait a minute.
I want to run through it once more.

1409
01:19:33,769 --> 01:19:35,168
Has she signed yet?

1410
01:19:35,237 --> 01:19:38,638
- Not yet, but she's going to.
- Listen, we've been fooled.

1411
01:19:38,740 --> 01:19:41,675
- That fellow, he's a lunatic.
- What fellow is that, pal?

1412
01:19:41,743 --> 01:19:44,940
- Clark, our backer.
- Odds bodkins. What are you gonna do?

1413
01:19:45,013 --> 01:19:47,675
- Me? I'm gonna get plastered.
- You're gonna get plastered?

1414
01:19:47,749 --> 01:19:50,547
Give me that.
Now, Oliver, remember your heart.

1415
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:52,553
You know what the doctor said.

1416
01:19:58,093 --> 01:19:59,287
Say, what is this?

1417
01:19:59,361 --> 01:20:01,727
- Just a formality.
- We're looking for Mr. Clark.

1418
01:20:01,797 --> 01:20:03,162
You got the wrong room.

1419
01:20:03,231 --> 01:20:05,096
What kind of a fellow is this man Clark?

1420
01:20:05,167 --> 01:20:06,896
Very religious and a little eccentric.

1421
01:20:06,968 --> 01:20:08,162
Is anybody in danger?

1422
01:20:08,236 --> 01:20:11,637
No, but we want to get him off the train
before we leave here.

1423
01:20:15,410 --> 01:20:16,399
Yes?

1424
01:20:17,078 --> 01:20:19,512
I can't see you now, gentlemen. I'm busy.

1425
01:20:19,581 --> 01:20:21,310
What are you doing there?

1426
01:20:21,783 --> 01:20:24,183
As it happens, I'm reading the Bible.

1427
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:25,978
Is him.

1428
01:20:26,054 --> 01:20:27,715
Get him.

1429
01:20:27,789 --> 01:20:28,983
Help!

1430
01:20:29,057 --> 01:20:31,651
Owen! Oliver!

1431
01:20:31,726 --> 01:20:34,251
What are you trying to do?
Let him go, you fools!

1432
01:20:34,329 --> 01:20:35,956
That' s Oscar Jaffe.

1433
01:20:36,031 --> 01:20:38,192
Owen, they're trying to strangle me.

1434
01:20:38,266 --> 01:20:40,791
They can't do that to a theater personality.

1435
01:20:40,869 --> 01:20:42,928
All right, I didn't know, Mr. Jaffe.

1436
01:20:43,004 --> 01:20:44,835
I'm sure you'll excuse this mistake...

1437
01:20:44,906 --> 01:20:47,238
but there's a lunatic on board,
I'm sorry to say...

1438
01:20:47,309 --> 01:20:49,504
- and we're trying to track him down.
- A lunatic?

1439
01:20:49,578 --> 01:20:52,069
- That' s rather interesting.
- Yes. A fellow named Clark.

1440
01:20:52,147 --> 01:20:54,638
He had Drawing Room J, right in this car.

1441
01:20:57,219 --> 01:20:59,619
He's hiding from us
and he's given us the slip.

1442
01:20:59,688 --> 01:21:01,815
He's harmless.
There's nothing to worry about.

1443
01:21:01,890 --> 01:21:02,879
Clark? What Clark?

1444
01:21:02,958 --> 01:21:04,983
That' s not Mr. Clark,
the patent medicine man?

1445
01:21:05,060 --> 01:21:06,118
Yes, a sad case.

1446
01:21:06,194 --> 01:21:09,391
They've had him away for over a year
but he escaped from the asylum.

1447
01:21:09,464 --> 01:21:12,092
I hope you'll overlook
the inconvenience, sir.

1448
01:21:13,935 --> 01:21:16,631
Lily, I've been bamboozled. I didn't...

1449
01:21:16,705 --> 01:21:18,969
This is the last time
I'm ever gonna speak to you.

1450
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:20,029
Lily, my beloved...

1451
01:21:20,108 --> 01:21:22,167
You've almost made a fool
out of Lily Garland.

1452
01:21:22,244 --> 01:21:24,940
If you ever bother me again,
I'll get a gun and shoot you.

1453
01:21:25,013 --> 01:21:28,505
Wait a minute. It' s going round.

1454
01:21:28,917 --> 01:21:30,179
I'm dizzy. Oliver!

1455
01:21:30,252 --> 01:21:33,517
No, crazy, you fake, you lunatic!

1456
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:39,418
I can't stand it. Open the window. I'm hot.

1457
01:21:39,594 --> 01:21:41,528
I can't stand it!

1458
01:21:42,197 --> 01:21:43,858
I'm going to break down!

1459
01:21:43,932 --> 01:21:45,331
Hello, Lily.

1460
01:21:45,567 --> 01:21:47,432
Max Jacobs.

1461
01:21:47,502 --> 01:21:50,801
Maxie. My sweetheart.

1462
01:21:50,872 --> 01:21:52,533
My darling. My angel.

1463
01:21:52,607 --> 01:21:55,872
I got a new Somerset Maugham play for you.
Just came out by plane.

1464
01:21:55,944 --> 01:21:59,380
Sweet, thas divine. Is marvelous.

1465
01:22:09,891 --> 01:22:11,017
Come in.

1466
01:22:14,562 --> 01:22:17,190
The Black Watch, sire, with their bagpipes.

1467
01:22:17,265 --> 01:22:20,666
- I suppose you're both drunk.
- Drunk or sober, I'm here, ain't I?

1468
01:22:20,735 --> 01:22:23,260
O.J., I'm in no mood
for a lot of fuzzy lamentations.

1469
01:22:23,338 --> 01:22:26,307
I won't keep you long, Owen.
Just a few words.

1470
01:22:26,374 --> 01:22:27,932
There's nothing more to say.

1471
01:22:28,009 --> 01:22:31,911
I've eaten dirt and crawled on my face
through the mud till I'm sick.

1472
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:34,073
I got some pride, you know.

1473
01:22:35,050 --> 01:22:37,678
That' s the final touch: pneumonia.

1474
01:22:37,752 --> 01:22:41,188
It' s typical of my career
that in the great crises of life...

1475
01:22:41,256 --> 01:22:45,556
I should stand flanked
by two incompetent alcoholics.

1476
01:22:46,094 --> 01:22:47,356
What' s that?

1477
01:22:47,429 --> 01:22:49,693
I'm sorry. I didn't mean for you to see it.

1478
01:22:49,764 --> 01:22:52,164
- Give me that.
- Now you know why I called you.

1479
01:22:52,233 --> 01:22:54,565
- Please.
- Yes, to say goodbye.

1480
01:22:54,636 --> 01:22:56,501
Owen, he's got a gun.

1481
01:22:58,073 --> 01:22:59,199
He's asleep.

1482
01:22:59,341 --> 01:23:02,970
That' s just like the Irish.
They always fail you in a pinch.

1483
01:23:03,044 --> 01:23:06,775
Listen, you foul Corsican, I've been
skinned alive 40 times under your banner.

1484
01:23:06,848 --> 01:23:07,940
Cut it out, Owen!

1485
01:23:08,016 --> 01:23:12,180
Do you remember the day, not long ago,
when I was Oscar Jaffe?

1486
01:23:12,253 --> 01:23:13,686
Stop it, please.

1487
01:23:13,755 --> 01:23:17,122
My outer office filled with celebrities...

1488
01:23:17,325 --> 01:23:18,587
cabinet ministers.

1489
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:21,959
I ain't hearing a word you say
until you put away that fowling piece.

1490
01:23:22,030 --> 01:23:25,022
Please let' s act like grownups for a change.

1491
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:27,796
Yesterday, Oscar Jaffe,
the wizard of Broadway.

1492
01:23:28,036 --> 01:23:31,267
Tomorrow, a foolish old pest...

1493
01:23:31,506 --> 01:23:35,272
haunting the theater lobbies
on other managers' first nights.

1494
01:23:36,311 --> 01:23:38,836
You wouldn't want
to see me like that, boys?

1495
01:23:40,548 --> 01:23:42,277
You'll remember me...

1496
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:45,114
whenever you hear that wild sound
in the night.

1497
01:23:45,186 --> 01:23:46,744
This is screwy.

1498
01:23:46,821 --> 01:23:51,690
Stop it. I can't stand any more joking.
You've made a drunkard out of me.

1499
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:53,091
Goodbye...

1500
01:23:54,562 --> 01:23:56,553
pale messenger of death.

1501
01:23:57,232 --> 01:24:02,067
Cold passport to the great unknown.

1502
01:24:02,771 --> 01:24:03,829
Mr. Jaffe!

1503
01:24:04,672 --> 01:24:08,665
Just an act. He'd keep it up
for three weeks if we stuck around.

1504
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:12,507
Hear those banshees. I don't like that.

1505
01:24:12,647 --> 01:24:13,875
Kill himself!

1506
01:24:14,616 --> 01:24:16,174
He'll outlive us all.

1507
01:24:17,285 --> 01:24:19,185
They always do.

1508
01:24:19,721 --> 01:24:23,316
It' s a dark night full of unfortunate sounds.

1509
01:24:24,492 --> 01:24:26,357
- What was that?
- He's faking.

1510
01:24:26,961 --> 01:24:30,658
Owen. Oliver. I've been shot!

1511
01:24:30,732 --> 01:24:32,495
He did it, the lunatic.

1512
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:34,033
Excuse me.

1513
01:24:34,135 --> 01:24:35,762
Give me that gun. Where'd he get you?

1514
01:24:35,837 --> 01:24:37,930
I don't know. I'm bleeding.

1515
01:24:38,006 --> 01:24:39,701
Lie down. Easy now. Take it easy.

1516
01:24:39,774 --> 01:24:42,334
I'll get a doctor. Don't move.

1517
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:45,902
I did it in self-defense.
He had the gun and pointed it at me.

1518
01:24:45,980 --> 01:24:47,948
It was his life or mine.

1519
01:24:48,016 --> 01:24:52,112
Owen, I was aiming at myself. He grabbed
the gun away from me and shot me.

1520
01:24:52,187 --> 01:24:56,453
That' s the final irony: killed by a lunatic.

1521
01:24:56,524 --> 01:24:58,617
Oscar, is there anything we can do?

1522
01:24:58,693 --> 01:25:01,093
Nothing. No prayers.

1523
01:25:01,162 --> 01:25:03,596
No, don't talk like that.

1524
01:25:03,731 --> 01:25:05,631
They can't hurt you.

1525
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:09,067
You'll be on your feet at the count of nine,
you old wounded lion.

1526
01:25:09,137 --> 01:25:10,934
I got a doctor. He's coming in.

1527
01:25:11,005 --> 01:25:13,473
- How is he? Breathing?
- Gentlemen, I didn't mean to...

1528
01:25:13,541 --> 01:25:15,873
- Keep away from him!
- Stay put or I'll crack you.

1529
01:25:15,944 --> 01:25:17,844
Gentlemen, it was all a mistake.

1530
01:25:17,912 --> 01:25:20,403
- Don't leave me now, boys.
- Never.

1531
01:25:20,482 --> 01:25:24,475
- Anything in the world you say, I'll do.
- Keep them out.

1532
01:25:24,619 --> 01:25:27,247
Maestro.

1533
01:25:28,223 --> 01:25:30,851
Open up here. Here's the doctor.

1534
01:25:30,925 --> 01:25:33,553
Here's the doctor. Hurry, Doctor. He's dying.

1535
01:25:33,661 --> 01:25:34,685
Maestro.

1536
01:25:34,762 --> 01:25:37,287
- Now you'll have to get out of here.
- He's our friend.

1537
01:25:37,365 --> 01:25:39,128
We have a contract with Mr. Jaffe.

1538
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:43,466
<i>Brighten the corner where you are!</i>

1539
01:25:43,605 --> 01:25:47,871
<i>Brighten the corner where you are!</i>

1540
01:25:48,676 --> 01:25:49,938
There you are.

1541
01:25:50,378 --> 01:25:52,744
So often the case,
lots of fright and no damage.

1542
01:25:52,814 --> 01:25:55,681
- You mean it isn't serious?
- Hardly penetrated the surface.

1543
01:25:55,750 --> 01:25:57,843
What do you mean? I'm weak.

1544
01:25:58,086 --> 01:25:59,678
It must be internal.

1545
01:25:59,754 --> 01:26:01,847
This is the worst I've ever been through.

1546
01:26:01,923 --> 01:26:04,915
You can go back to bed now.
You'll be all right in the morning.

1547
01:26:04,993 --> 01:26:07,723
Come on,
I'll help you to your drawing room.

1548
01:26:08,062 --> 01:26:10,622
Come on. The doc says you're in fine fettle.

1549
01:26:10,698 --> 01:26:14,964
Owen, Oliver, I have an inspiration.
Overwhelming.

1550
01:26:15,103 --> 01:26:18,561
- O.J., no more shenanigans.
- You got that contract?

1551
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:20,335
She'll sign it this time.

1552
01:26:20,408 --> 01:26:23,343
She loves me.
I could tell that through her screaming.

1553
01:26:23,411 --> 01:26:26,039
I must reach that love somehow,
bring her to her senses.

1554
01:26:26,114 --> 01:26:29,345
Boys, this is the last thing
I'll ever ask of you.

1555
01:26:29,884 --> 01:26:32,512
Go on, Owen, tell her I'm dying...

1556
01:26:32,587 --> 01:26:34,418
and don't overact.

1557
01:26:34,489 --> 01:26:37,219
Stand by. I'll get her Daisy.
It' s a Jaffe production.

1558
01:26:37,292 --> 01:26:39,260
Come on, Oliver, we're going into action.

1559
01:26:39,327 --> 01:26:42,660
Here, set that chair, center.
Wait a minute, a little bit off-center.

1560
01:26:42,730 --> 01:26:46,598
Fix the lights. We're gonna do this
like the last act of <i>Camille.</i>

1561
01:26:46,701 --> 01:26:48,362
We'll get it exactly, O.J.

1562
01:26:48,436 --> 01:26:49,460
Is it hitting me?

1563
01:26:49,537 --> 01:26:50,834
- How's that?
- Perfect.

1564
01:26:51,339 --> 01:26:52,636
I can't believe it.

1565
01:26:52,707 --> 01:26:55,107
I couldn't believe it either
when I heard it. Hurry.

1566
01:26:55,176 --> 01:26:56,666
I'll be right there.

1567
01:26:58,479 --> 01:27:01,277
- Oliver, remember what I told you.
- She's coming.

1568
01:27:02,650 --> 01:27:04,618
- Here he is.
- Where is he?

1569
01:27:05,553 --> 01:27:06,815
Oscar.

1570
01:27:07,455 --> 01:27:09,980
- Who's that?
- It' s Lily.

1571
01:27:10,158 --> 01:27:11,648
Bring her to me.

1572
01:27:12,193 --> 01:27:16,527
I'm here. My poor Oscar, speak.
Speak to me.

1573
01:27:16,598 --> 01:27:17,963
I'm going to go mad.

1574
01:27:18,032 --> 01:27:22,025
The doctor says is straight
through the heart. He can't talk very much.

1575
01:27:23,605 --> 01:27:25,163
Who is that crying?

1576
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:29,108
- It' s Lily, Lily Garland.
- Lily, give me your hand.

1577
01:27:29,177 --> 01:27:30,576
Where's your hand?

1578
01:27:30,678 --> 01:27:34,136
Why did you do this?
Why did you do this terrible thing?

1579
01:27:34,215 --> 01:27:37,150
It was for the best, Lily. Everyone left...

1580
01:27:37,585 --> 01:27:40,520
those that I loved and needed.

1581
01:27:41,990 --> 01:27:45,653
It' s getting dark. Don't go for a little while.

1582
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:49,491
Oscar, I did it. I drove you to it.

1583
01:27:51,833 --> 01:27:54,802
Dear, lovely Lily. No tears.

1584
01:27:55,503 --> 01:27:59,599
It wasn't your fault. I only wish
I could have seen you once more.

1585
01:27:59,707 --> 01:28:01,607
Held you once.

1586
01:28:02,176 --> 01:28:03,905
- Oliver.
- Yes.

1587
01:28:04,846 --> 01:28:08,839
Where's the contract,
the last one I drew up with Lily Garland?

1588
01:28:08,916 --> 01:28:10,281
Here it is.

1589
01:28:11,319 --> 01:28:14,880
- Boys, can you still hear me?
- Yes.

1590
01:28:15,790 --> 01:28:19,055
I want this buried with me on my body...

1591
01:28:19,327 --> 01:28:23,058
next to my heart
when it has stopped beating.

1592
01:28:23,298 --> 01:28:24,629
No!

1593
01:28:25,366 --> 01:28:26,594
Where is she?

1594
01:28:28,102 --> 01:28:29,729
Is she still here?

1595
01:28:29,804 --> 01:28:32,500
I'm here, beside you.

1596
01:28:32,607 --> 01:28:34,871
It' s hard to die here...

1597
01:28:37,011 --> 01:28:39,605
between nowhere and nowhere.

1598
01:28:39,681 --> 01:28:42,343
I should have waited
till I was back in the theater...

1599
01:28:42,417 --> 01:28:45,614
amongst the dust and echoes that I loved.

1600
01:28:46,020 --> 01:28:47,453
- Oliver.
- Yes?

1601
01:28:47,522 --> 01:28:49,456
- Where's the contract?
- Here it is.

1602
01:28:49,524 --> 01:28:50,718
Ask her.

1603
01:28:50,792 --> 01:28:54,728
Ask her if she'd mind
putting her name on it.

1604
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:57,958
Lily, it' s his last request.

1605
01:28:58,032 --> 01:29:02,366
- Yes, give it to me.
- Here's a pen. Sign on the dotted line.

1606
01:29:03,004 --> 01:29:05,495
Hurry, while I can still see.

1607
01:29:05,573 --> 01:29:07,370
Let me in there. I'm Max Jacobs.

1608
01:29:07,442 --> 01:29:09,239
Lily, look out what you're doing.

1609
01:29:09,310 --> 01:29:13,406
You're too late, Max Mandlebaum.

1610
01:29:16,651 --> 01:29:19,119
D'Artagnan rides again.

1611
01:29:21,489 --> 01:29:25,016
I have been looking forward
to this little occasion for some time.

1612
01:29:25,093 --> 01:29:28,221
There's no thrill in the world
like launching a new play.

1613
01:29:28,296 --> 01:29:31,663
But I want you to realize one thing.

1614
01:29:31,999 --> 01:29:33,796
No matter what I may say...

1615
01:29:33,868 --> 01:29:37,031
no matter what I may do on this stage
during our work...

1616
01:29:38,239 --> 01:29:39,797
I love you all.

1617
01:29:40,308 --> 01:29:41,969
Oliver, call the rehearsal.

1618
01:29:42,043 --> 01:29:43,806
Act 1. Places, please.

1619
01:29:43,878 --> 01:29:47,905
No. We will start
with Miss Garlanïs entrance.

1620
01:29:48,249 --> 01:29:49,477
Miss Garland.

1621
01:29:54,622 --> 01:29:56,283
Good morning, <i>monsieur.</i>

1622
01:29:56,657 --> 01:29:58,488
Now, don't be nervous, child.

1623
01:29:58,893 --> 01:30:00,485
You are Betty Anne.

1624
01:30:00,862 --> 01:30:04,628
This ragged little thing they found
wandering in the cotton fields.

1625
01:30:04,699 --> 01:30:05,825
Yes, Oscar.

1626
01:30:06,267 --> 01:30:09,794
And Col. Merryweather brings you
into this beautiful Southern mansion.

1627
01:30:09,871 --> 01:30:10,929
Yes, I know, Oscar.

1628
01:30:11,005 --> 01:30:12,302
Places, please!

1629
01:30:14,342 --> 01:30:15,809
Make your entrance.

1630
01:30:24,085 --> 01:30:28,146
"Col. Merryweather,
why you all look at me so strange?"

1631
01:30:28,523 --> 01:30:32,084
Stop. Let' s do this thing correctly.

1632
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:35,989
You've been in Hollywood too long.
I think you've forgotten a lot of things.

1633
01:30:36,063 --> 01:30:38,588
- Give me the chalk.
- I want it distinctly understood...

1634
01:30:38,666 --> 01:30:40,793
Now I'll show you
how it' s done in the theater.

1635
01:30:40,868 --> 01:30:42,495
Now when you enter...

1636
01:30:42,570 --> 01:30:46,370
you follow this line here
and you stop right there.

1637
01:30:47,041 --> 01:30:48,872
One, then you come over here...

1638
01:30:48,943 --> 01:30:52,572
Here we go again, Oliver.
With Livingstone through darkest Africa.

1639
01:30:52,647 --> 01:30:55,013
Oscar, you forget who I am.

1640
01:30:55,082 --> 01:30:56,982
You can't talk to me this way!

1641
01:30:57,051 --> 01:31:00,043
Everyone else in Hollywood
would give their souls to have me!

1642
01:31:00,121 --> 01:31:02,146
Oscar, you can't do this to me!
