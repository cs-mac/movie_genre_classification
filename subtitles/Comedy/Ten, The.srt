<i>[4 years ago]
- Where are you?</i>

3
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,940
I just passed Young Wol.

4
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,120
<i>Honey...</i>

5
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,620
What now?

6
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,420
<i>You heading over there is making me nervous for no reason.</i>

7
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:33,650
Then, should I just quit and go home?

8
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:35,660
Do I need to chop off my fingers for you to believe me?

9
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,840
<i>Don't say things like that.</i>

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,730
<i>Hang on.</i>

11
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:41,390
<i>Daddy!</i>

12
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:42,670
Minji!

13
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:47,620
I'll be home early tomorrow after work so listen to Mom...

14
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:48,500
Okay?

15
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,710
<i>Daddy!</i>

16
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,890
Addict

17
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,850
You must want some ice cream.

18
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,120
Minji...

19
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,850
My name is Hyo Jung.

20
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:58,970
We don't need this!

21
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,260
What?

22
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,570
<i>Hey... go bet for someone.</i>

23
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:19,280
I told you I'm resting today.

24
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,550
Shut up and hurry.
I'm in a rush.

25
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,240
I think they'll give us some.

26
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,600
<i>Fine, I can get someone else.</i>

27
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:30,830
What time?

28
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:34,030
You little... trying to play hard to get.

29
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,860
I'll give you the address, write it down.

30
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,550
What address.

31
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:39,000
<i>They told us to go to their house.</i>

32
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:10,030
<i>Who is it?</i>

33
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,500
Did you call for someone?

34
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,590
Mrs. Kwon!

35
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,030
Mrs. Kwon!

36
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:36,430
Did she forget about morning prayer?

37
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,570
Why is it open?

38
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:41,530
Mrs. Kwon! Are you home?

39
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,170
<i>Detective Baek.</i>

40
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:16,280
<i>Come back.</i>

41
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,250
<Quick Mover>
I'm tired of it...

42
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,450
I'm tired of the smell of blood.

43
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:23,960
I'm tired of feeling sorry for myself in Seoul.

44
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,940
This matches me anyway.

45
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:13,360
You're a girl?

46
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,780
You can't tell?

47
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,270
You're a student here?

48
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,800
Junior Class, Room 3.

49
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,760
Oh, sorry...

50
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,050
Sorry, sorry...

51
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,250
What?

52
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,510
<i>An entire family has been murdered.</i>

53
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:37,510
So what?
Call Flounder.

54
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:39,760
<i>Senior, you remember Kang Jong Yoon, right?</i>

55
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:45,620
<i>An entire family was found murdered at Kang Won Do...</i>

56
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,710
<i>...Jung Sun Goon, Shin Won Ri this afternoon.</i>

57
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:52,650
<i>Mr. Lim, who was murdered the night before, had called Mr. Kang...</i>

58
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:55,420
<i>...to help place a bet, based on the statements.</i>

59
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:59,960
<i>Kang killed the family and robbed their house.</i>

60
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,330
<i>The police are currently looking for the fleeing suspect.</i>

61
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:07,830
<i>Meanwhile, Kang, who stole 2 billion dollars at a casino 4 years ago...</i>

62
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:11,090
<i>...was last seen wandering around the venues-</i>

63
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,930
- Hey!
- Senior!

64
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:17,950
Are you sure it's Kang Jong Yoon?

65
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,350
Yes.

66
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,960
Mr. Park had called him into this house the night before the crime.

67
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,510
And we confirmed his face with the witness.

68
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,940
Nothing's changed.

69
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:35,070
This way.

70
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,110
What's wrong with her teeth?

71
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:58,770
Did she get hit?

72
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:01,500
You can't break teeth without injuring the mouth.

73
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,240
I think the victim bit something.

74
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:06,030
He escaped this way.

75
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:13,820
Victim's identity?

76
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,960
He was a loan shark by the name of Im Do Sool.

77
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,420
It looks like he took all the cash that was in the house.

78
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,780
But, they're looking into the exact amount.

79
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,480
What's our radius search?

80
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,820
20 km.

81
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,310
Make it 40.

82
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:28,150
Why?

83
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,020
You were in the Army Reserves.
You wouldn't know...

84
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,060
This bastard was in the Marines Special Forces.

85
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,150
Did you send someone over to his house?

86
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,300
H-house?

87
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,970
How long have you been doing this?

88
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,340
Gwang Pal!

89
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,780
Let me ask a favor!

90
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,360
He took his cash, jewels, everything and split.

91
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,160
Bank account?

92
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,470
<i>Clean.</i>

93
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:05,090
He must have been in a rush,
even leaving the dish soap!

94
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:06,940
Okay. Thank you.

95
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,070
That means he was on the same page.

96
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,730
Everything is set, right?

97
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:28,960
Who do you think I am?

98
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,310
I told them to call as soon as they see a suspicious guy.

99
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:33,480
I already told all the merchant ships.

100
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:37,170
But, is he really coming here?

101
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:40,570
The thing about gambling addicts...

102
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:43,180
Instead of killing people...

103
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:46,280
They care more about gambling.
That's the scary thing.

104
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,400
Their heads go crazy if they think they can't gamble again.

105
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:54,250
Sooner or later, his wife will be here to bring him money.

106
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,040
This is the only place he can keep gambling.

107
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:03,700
Is this the bastard I'm thinking of?

108
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,740
The one who screwed you over!

109
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:11,790
No wonder you're so into it!

110
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,680
If I hear that he smuggled out...

111
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,430
You know what'll happen, right?

112
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:29,890
What?

113
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:32,010
<i>Senior! We found Kang Jong Yoon's cellphone!</i>

114
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:32,740
Where?

115
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,780
Young Wol Terminal.

116
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,930
Young Wol?

117
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:37,200
Young Wol is in the opposite direction!

118
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,900
Is this another mess up?

119
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,030
What?

120
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:15,960
Senior!

121
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,740
<i>Kang Jong Yoon is inside a bus right now.</i>

122
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,430
<i>He'll be arriving in Won Ju at 1:30.</i>

123
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:20,530
Won Ju?

124
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,440
Sorry! Sorry!

125
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,090
Hey Baldie! You wanna die?!

126
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:34,950
Baldie?

127
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:37,500
Okay! Sorry!

128
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,310
Sorry. Sorry.
This is the police.

129
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,860
Wait! Wait!

130
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:01,270
<i>Senior! Now!
He turned his phone on!</i>

131
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,790
What are you doing?!

132
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,890
Stay still.
I'll break your arm.

133
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:15,260
Save me!

134
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:21,870
Who are you?

135
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,240
I only took $30!

136
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,210
I just needed to make a call once I got here.

137
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:35,840
What?

138
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,560
<i>We sighted Kang Jong Yoon not too long ago.</i>

139
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,360
What? Where?

140
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,870
He was in... Jung Sun.

141
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:44,140
Jung Sun?

142
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:40,400
I really thought that was him.

143
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:46,520
What kind of crazy man would do that so close to the police station?

144
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:50,810
What's that?

145
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:54,940
Im Min Sub, the victim's brother.

146
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:57,380
Send him off.

147
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,420
Yes.

148
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,180
Excuse me.

149
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:04,060
You can go back now.
You can't stay here.

150
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,570
We'll contact you later.

151
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,710
Bye.

152
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,540
That's a great photo.

153
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:34,090
Did you forget that we have a hearing next week?

154
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,180
The Boss decided he wants to be involved.

155
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,460
Regional Unit.

156
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,240
What have you been doing not taking the lead?

157
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,640
I'm sorry.

158
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,970
If you give us a week-

159
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:47,430
Give us 3 days.

160
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,060
Because he was caught red-handed...

161
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:03,980
They're wondering how fast we can catch him...

162
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,810
This case is hard as hell but there'll be no reward for catching him.

163
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,460
Is it because of Detective Baek?

164
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:13,560
The way he murdered the family members still doesn't make sense.

165
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:16,950
Anyway...

166
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:21,270
When his kid grows up, this crime will be the most painful for her.

167
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:26,630
What could be more painful than watching the person you love kill someone?

168
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:33,300
I shouldn't have said that.

169
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:35,300
It's fine.

170
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,960
It's more painful to have forgotten the pain.

171
00:19:56,890 --> 00:20:01,530
I can't believe that he was over Jung Sun and didn't run farther away.

172
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:04,110
What in the world could've gotten into him?

173
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,320
Did Kang Jong Yoon show up?

174
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,750
No!

175
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,080
Then why did you call?

176
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,070
Somebody else came looking for him...

177
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,010
Who was it?

178
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:25,660
A rough looking guy.

179
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,140
<i>I thought maybe just in case.</i>

180
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,610
Go ahead and write this down.

181
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:32,760
Silver Grandeur, license number 9881.

182
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,010
Okay.

183
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,640
Search for a Silver Grandeur, license number 9881.

184
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,430
Fine.

185
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:54,700
Wait.

186
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,750
Go back a little.

187
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,000
Stop.

188
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,470
That's Bong Yang, right?

189
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:14,290
Yes.

190
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,190
He went inside at 1:22...

191
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,360
...and came out at 1:45.

192
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:12,200
2 minutes, 57 seconds.

193
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:16,910
If that took 3 minutes, then that means he was here for 20.

194
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:22,010
What did that bastard do here?

195
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,600
Where could he have gone?

196
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,700
Have you seen this man?

197
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,150
I've never seen him.

198
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,000
Mrs.!

199
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,880
Have you seen this person by any chance?

200
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,410
I'm not a Mrs.

201
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:54,230
Sorry to bother you but have you seen this person?

202
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,110
I've never seen him.

203
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,320
I'm not sure...

204
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:25,840
I thought I told you that I've never seen him.

205
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:42,820
You little...

206
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:53,110
Found it!

207
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,600
I was hesitant at first.

208
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,650
What can you do for me for $500?

209
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:29,690
In this economy, the question is what can't I do for you.

210
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,350
If...

211
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:34,840
I wanted to look for someone.

212
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,940
I'm not sure...

213
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:41,460
I have to renew my contract next month...

214
00:24:57,050 --> 00:25:02,060
I can even look for a stray dog that ran away 10 years ago for you.

215
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:04,420
Let's see... who are you looking for?

216
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:12,400
A guy who wants to kill Im Do Sool.

217
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:19,420
A guy that wants to kill Im Do Sool?

218
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,630
I took the money.

219
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:26,970
But isn't it funny?

220
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,760
Why was he looking when he's the one who killed him?

221
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,790
What was the suspect's specialty?

222
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:42,020
Marine.

223
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,750
Do you see something strange?

224
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:46,300
He stabbed him in the chest 8 times...

225
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:49,260
But, he completely avoided the body's pressure points.

226
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:52,250
Could it be a coincidence?

227
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:55,360
It could be... but there's very little chance of that.

228
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,680
The deepest wound was on the left side of the neck.

229
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,250
This is the only time he stabbed at a pressure point.

230
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:04,120
He must be a pro.

231
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:08,980
We found a fiber sample on his neck that matched the daughter's outfit.

232
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:14,820
He must've killed the daughter first and then the father.

233
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:21,290
When do you think the wife was killed?

234
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:23,770
The autopsy isn't complete yet but looking at the muscle contraction,

235
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:27,410
she was killed 1-2 hours before the other two.

236
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:33,140
Wife, daughter, victim.

237
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,060
What?

238
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,060
The order that he killed them.

239
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,120
Did I ever thank you for coming?

240
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,210
You did.

241
00:26:55,990 --> 00:27:00,160
Nam Yeh Ri will stay in Seoul and talk to the suspect's family members.

242
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,800
Is anyone there?

243
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,080
Ah... yes...
Hello.

244
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,020
I'm from the police.

245
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,120
You're Kim Eun Joo's nephew, right?

246
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:16,640
I've broken ties with those people a long time ago.

247
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,200
But! Wait-

248
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,760
I'm here to ask about Kim Eun Joo.

249
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,600
I'm so tired of this!

250
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:30,610
I have some questions about Kim Eun Joo-

251
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,140
What?

252
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,760
Who the hell is that?

253
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,820
Hey punk!

254
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,430
Senior.

255
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:02,890
It's been a year.

256
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,400
What are you doing here?

257
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:07,520
Well...

258
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,520
This case was given to us.

259
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:13,610
You know...
From above...

260
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,070
And so...

261
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,730
You came here trying to take on the case?

262
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:23,170
Yes.

263
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:29,330
Where's Director Yeo?

264
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,070
Encounter

265
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:45,750
There are blood stains on the wall but not on the frame.

266
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:50,240
That means the frame wasn't there during the crime.

267
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:53,640
You're still the same.
Director Yeo.

268
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:58,530
For a culprit who left his fingerprints everywhere...

269
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:02,070
Why would he dare to take the frame off and put it back on?

270
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:04,600
It probably fell during a fight.

271
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,780
Then, what's the motive?

272
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:10,920
The only thing missing from the scene is a couple of checks and some cash.

273
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,230
For that, he stabbed three people?

274
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,720
For some reason...

275
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:20,490
That doesn't fit with this kind of complicated crime scene.

276
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:22,220
What are you saying?

277
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:26,850
Sounds like you're saying the culprit might have been framed...

278
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:32,320
The culprit left Im Do Sool in a not so fatal state...

279
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,720
...and stabbed the wife and daughter first.

280
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,310
Why would he do that?

281
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:41,810
Pain...

282
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:49,790
The culprit wanted the victim to watch his family get murdered.

283
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:53,770
This murder was for revenge.

284
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:56,670
Director Yeo.

285
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,780
What do you know about Kang Jong Yoon?

286
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,760
I know about the attempted murder case from 3 years ago.

287
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,630
I heard you were in charge back then.

288
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:08,990
Then, I'm sure you know that it's the same technique.

289
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:11,350
Kang Jong Yoon is claiming his innocence until the end.

290
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,870
Saying that he only went in because he thought he knew someone...

291
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:17,060
That it's unfair...

292
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:19,060
To not let him go to jail...

293
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:24,040
That he couldn't let his daughter become the daughter of a murderer...

294
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,680
He begged on his hands and knees, that bastard.

295
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:31,110
Do you know the first thing he did after receiving probation?

296
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:47,410
Right when I saw those eyes, I knew.

297
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:51,130
Ah... So this is it.

298
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:55,030
Gambling addicts will do anything to keep gambling.

299
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:59,950
Putting on a show to get what they want is nothing to them.

300
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:02,210
I won't make the same mistake twice.

301
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:05,770
You're the one who helped him get out of jail on probation.

302
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:11,180
Don't tell me they're blaming you for this family's death.

303
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,630
Mixing personal feelings into an investigation...

304
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:18,980
...is the deadliest thing.

305
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:23,400
Personal feelings?

306
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,760
Look who's talking, Director Yeo.

307
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:30,770
You said this was for revenge, didn't you?

308
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:33,510
Ah...

309
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:36,130
Because revenge is your specialty.

310
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:40,730
Isn't that why you're known for?

311
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:48,070
In this territory, there are a lot of things you won't understand.

312
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:52,260
These Detectives are mean and nasty.

313
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,600
They don't like outsiders poking their head in their case.

314
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,600
So leave quietly.

315
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:10,320
Come in.
2nd floor.

316
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:15,200
Did she have any close friends?

317
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,580
No! Only debt collectors.

318
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:22,860
What are these numbers?

319
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,900
She's so strange.

320
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,580
Her daughter is old enough to know her numbers.

321
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:31,380
I don't know why she wrote these numbers on the stairs.

322
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:48,440
No usage of the transportation card or call history after the crime...

323
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:53,910
She didn't meet anyone either...

324
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:03,890
Where could she have gone with her child?

325
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:39,290
These are all new.

326
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,600
A man?

327
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,490
This is Yeo Ji Hoon from the Special Affairs Team.

328
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:11,010
Where is the wine bottle that was at the crime scene?

329
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:14,260
<i>It's in custody at the NFS for fingerprint verification.</i>

330
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:17,170
Would you be able to call them and send me a photo?

331
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:22,020
<i>We have a photo.
But Kang Jong Yoon's fingerprints are very subtle.</i>

332
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:26,450
I don't need the fingerprints.
I need the label.

333
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:35,900
Can we at least eat?
I'm starving.

334
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:39,750
After giving him the orders,
we should be hearing from him soon.

335
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:44,480
Would he actually be that stupid to act up when the police is around?

336
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,280
He's coming.

337
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:03,380
You little punk.

338
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:08,010
How many years has it been and you don't even know anything here.

339
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,210
Let's go.

340
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,350
Cheval Blanc.

341
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:05,930
Keep watch here.

342
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:06,780
Yes, Senior.

343
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:24,160
The account book?

344
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,750
Of course, I brought it.

345
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:48,880
The rest is in here.

346
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,820
Forget the money.

347
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,720
Min Sub.

348
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:03,130
All done, right?

349
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:05,270
I'm leaving first.

350
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:16,060
What are you still doing here and not running away?

351
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:18,870
Why... are you doing this?

352
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:30,500
Stay right there.

353
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,420
Where is Kang Jong Yoon?

354
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:41,120
I said where is Kang Jong Yoon, you bastard.

355
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:44,140
There.

356
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:06,290
Who the hell is this?

357
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:19,630
Assault, robbery, threat.

358
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:22,180
Your records are impressive.

359
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:24,170
I played around when I was a kid.

360
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:27,320
Is there something wrong with that?

361
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,530
So...

362
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,280
You wanted to catch Kang Jong Yoon yourself?

363
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:35,540
He murdered my brother's entire family.

364
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:38,810
If you were me, would you let him get away?

365
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:44,120
License plate 9881, Silver Grandeur.

366
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,790
Was that you?

367
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,470
Yes.

368
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:57,790
What did you give him?

369
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:05,470
If you lie again,
I'll rip your mouth off.

370
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:09,440
The account book.

371
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:13,680
Account book...
What account book?

372
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,750
Who else would want to kill a loan shark except people who are in debt?

373
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:18,720
That's why I made the private-

374
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:23,240
Whenever you open your mouth,
it's always a lie!

375
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:26,530
Why would a killer look for someone that could kill him?!

376
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:29,960
It's true. I just gave him the account book, that's it!

377
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:40,950
Was Im Do Sool ever threatened before in his life?

378
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,020
Threatened?

379
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,120
Think carefully.

380
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:49,190
If he ran a pawn shop for gamblers,
I'm sure there were a few people.

381
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:51,700
What are you saying?

382
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:54,640
Even though his job was shady,
he lived an honest life!

383
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,000
You motherfuc-

384
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:58,680
Motherfucker?

385
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,650
Motherfuc-

386
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,910
I can have you rot in jail for disrupting an interrogation.

387
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,500
Watch your language.

388
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,080
Should I feed you prison food?

389
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,140
Director Yeo.

390
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:26,100
What are you doing?

391
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,960
This is the wine that the criminal drank.

392
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,150
Looking at Im Do Sool's wine collection...

393
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:35,910
Most of the labels were ridiculously expensive.

394
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:37,900
Should I say he had vulgar taste?

395
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:43,050
If he had to choose one wine out of his entire collection...

396
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,060
It would be this one.

397
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,920
1982 Cheval Blanc.

398
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:55,050
Is it a coincidence that the culprit chose to drink this specific wine?

399
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,420
You can fool one's eyes.

400
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:02,460
But you can't fool one's taste.

401
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:03,830
Taste?

402
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:06,380
We've been doing this the wrong way.

403
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:10,030
Kang Jong Yoon isn't the criminal.
He was framed.

404
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:12,090
And he's looking for the real killer right now.

405
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,680
The one wanting revenge against Im Do Sool...

406
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:19,200
The one who likes Cheval Blanc...

407
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:21,950
Wait.

408
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:23,930
So...

409
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:28,580
So you're saying it wasn't that gambler but someone else?

410
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:35,420
Kang Jong Yoon is finding the real killer?

411
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:44,390
Whether it's Cheval or bullshit or whatever-

412
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:47,270
My taste is soju so I'll go my own way.

413
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:54,400
While you write your novel, I'll be investigating the medical facilities.

414
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:01,820
Kang Jong Yoon is calling!

415
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:04,070
He wants to talk to the Detective in charge.

416
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:55,980
Kang Jong Yoon is calling!

417
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:57,860
He wants to talk to the Detective in charge.

418
00:47:15,870 --> 00:47:18,230
This is Yeo Ji Hoon from the Special Affairs Team.

419
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:20,050
<i>It's him!
The bastard who called me!</i>

420
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:23,980
I thought that bastard was dead.

421
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:27,120
<i>The man I met that night wasn't Im Do Sool!</i>

422
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:29,260
Kang Jong Yoon.

423
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:31,360
Right now, you're wanted as the prime suspect.

424
00:47:32,270 --> 00:47:34,120
If you want to prove your innocence, come to the station-

425
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:36,980
You don't think I know that you'll just arrest me?

426
00:47:37,890 --> 00:47:40,110
I'm telling you that the bastard framed me!

427
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:46,880
I'll record this conversation so tell me in detail.

428
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:53,020
Okay.

429
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:53,990
Start.

430
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:57,110
<i>I went to the house...</i>

431
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:00,460
<i>That bastard let me in...</i>

432
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:03,060
<i>I thought it was his house.</i>

433
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:09,350
Good work today.
Have a seat.

434
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:20,660
Have a drink.

435
00:48:24,590 --> 00:48:25,870
Thank you.

436
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:39,680
Did you bring what I asked for?

437
00:48:40,590 --> 00:48:41,980
Ah, yes.

438
00:48:43,530 --> 00:48:45,350
I couldn't find the brand you were looking for.

439
00:48:53,150 --> 00:48:55,340
The frame fell.

440
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:57,350
My daughter likes to play around.

441
00:48:57,350 --> 00:48:59,250
I'm sure you know how 4 year olds can get.

442
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:01,370
Tell me about your family.

443
00:49:01,370 --> 00:49:03,320
Do I really need to say?

444
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:05,890
You don't have to if you don't want to.

445
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,410
Can I have another drink?

446
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:28,640
Today is my daughter's birthday.

447
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,880
The last time I saw her was when she was two.

448
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,610
She should be 6 now.

449
00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:36,530
You should at least call.

450
00:49:37,950 --> 00:49:40,490
I've given up on seeing her in real life.

451
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:44,050
When I think about her and my wife...

452
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:47,170
Someone like me should die.

453
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:49,220
We should go to hell.

454
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,780
I should've cut my wrists back then.

455
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:56,340
There's no point in cutting your wrists.

456
00:49:57,650 --> 00:49:59,860
If you're going to cut them, you should cut them here.

457
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:20,270
If I hire you for 2 days, is 7 enough?

458
00:50:20,270 --> 00:50:21,650
That's plenty.

459
00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:24,440
I initially invested in one week.

460
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:26,390
But something came up.

461
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:43,040
This is for tip.

462
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:55,380
After waiting outside the casino for hours, I went back.

463
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:57,570
They were already dead.

464
00:50:57,570 --> 00:50:59,880
Any witnesses or alibi?

465
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:01,420
Anyone you met?

466
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:03,170
Nobody.

467
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:05,830
I don't know.

468
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:08,320
Hey Kang Jong Yoon!

469
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:11,150
If you already got the money,
why did you go back?

470
00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:12,490
Especially at dawn?!

471
00:51:12,490 --> 00:51:14,910
Why don't you come here and draw the montage then, you bastard?!

472
00:51:14,910 --> 00:51:16,640
<i>That-</i>

473
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,240
<i>It was too dark so I couldn't see him.</i>

474
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,950
Stop lying, you bastard!

475
00:51:23,110 --> 00:51:24,380
That crazy bastard.

476
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:27,110
Trying to act like he didn't see him!

477
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:32,340
Senior! We were able to track his phone.

478
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:34,710
You stay here.
Everyone go go!

479
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:49,160
The perfect scenario to frame someone...

480
00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:52,710
Too cruel...

481
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,930
Too precise...

482
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,970
After a fake phone call...

483
00:52:21,790 --> 00:52:24,150
You even leave a photo?

484
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:30,570
Kang Jong Yoon, you bastard.

485
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:36,160
Monster vs. Viper

486
00:52:58,030 --> 00:52:59,630
Don't make a sound.

487
00:53:01,590 --> 00:53:08,470
We try to create a happy lifestyle for the families of gambling addicts.

488
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:11,410
We encourage them to wear nice clothes and makeup.

489
00:53:11,410 --> 00:53:14,290
We want them to feel attractive.

490
00:53:14,290 --> 00:53:17,640
Because of that,
we often get misunderstandings.

491
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:24,210
Ah... that's...

492
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:28,170
Those are the steps that we encourage them to follow.

493
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:32,930
Kim Eunjoo took them very seriously.

494
00:53:32,930 --> 00:53:35,000
12 steps?

495
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:45,190
We recommended that they write it down on stairs.

496
00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:46,980
So that every time they walked down...

497
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:51,330
They would be able to take in good words of encouragement.

498
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:56,950
Rule #1.

499
00:53:56,950 --> 00:54:00,600
Let's acknowledge the fact that we live with a gambling addict.

500
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:05,190
Rule #2.

501
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:08,750
Let's not blame them.

502
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:17,860
Rule #3.

503
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:23,070
Let's accept the fact that the past is the past.

504
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:27,240
Rule #4.

505
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,270
Let's not give up.

506
00:54:31,410 --> 00:54:32,930
Let's not give up.

507
00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:41,160
Let's not give up.

508
00:54:42,270 --> 00:54:44,360
Let's not give up.

509
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:52,020
She wasn't having an affair.

510
00:54:52,710 --> 00:54:55,960
Wearing makeup...
to be able to smile again...

511
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:58,810
She did this to remind herself never to give up.

512
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:04,020
While hoping for her husband to return...

513
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:47,500
I thought he was just cruel but he's precise too.

514
00:55:50,070 --> 00:55:53,730
Setting everything up in such a short period of time...

515
00:55:53,730 --> 00:55:56,370
This punk is sleek.

516
00:55:56,370 --> 00:55:59,630
What kind of show is he going to put up next time?

517
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:02,550
Senior! But...

518
00:56:02,550 --> 00:56:08,840
Doesn't it seem strange that he would do all that for money?

519
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,240
Like the Seoul team said...

520
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:15,850
Maybe it has to do with money and revenge?

521
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:20,580
You're starting to sound like the Seoul team.

522
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:25,190
Is that a crime scene or a next door gathering?

523
00:56:25,190 --> 00:56:27,190
Why is the whole world in there?

524
00:56:27,810 --> 00:56:30,010
Why are you hitting me?

525
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:33,990
Maybe they went there because they're family of the deceased.

526
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:35,010
Wait.

527
00:56:39,010 --> 00:56:40,870
Isn't there something weird about that bastard?

528
00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:42,550
What?

529
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:49,950
For someone who wants revenge for his brother...

530
00:56:49,950 --> 00:56:52,520
After seeing the body,
he's not interested at all.

531
00:56:54,530 --> 00:56:56,910
There's something fishy about him.

532
00:56:58,290 --> 00:56:59,590
Watch over this.

533
00:57:00,110 --> 00:57:01,640
Where are you going?

534
00:57:13,970 --> 00:57:16,500
There were no extra copies of the account book.

535
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:19,630
It'll take some time for us to search everyone on the list.

536
00:57:21,430 --> 00:57:24,820
There's a book by Dostoevsky called, "Crime & Punishment."

537
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:26,710
It's an interesting title.

538
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:28,050
Crime and punishment...

539
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:34,140
The context is a loan shark and daughter are killed with an ax.

540
00:57:35,310 --> 00:57:40,910
That kind of educational book isn't really meant for loan sharks.

541
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:18,360
Director!

542
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:21,540
You said that this case was an act of revenge, right?

543
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:23,790
After looking into Im Do Sool's medical records...

544
00:58:23,790 --> 00:58:25,630
Something interesting came up.

545
00:58:25,630 --> 00:58:28,220
Im Do Sool got treated for syphilis last month.

546
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:29,190
Syphilis?

547
00:58:29,190 --> 00:58:30,250
Yes.

548
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:34,280
But a week later, Im Min Sub and Nam Min Jung got the same treatment.

549
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:35,790
Who's Nam Min Jung?

550
00:58:35,790 --> 00:58:37,340
<i>Im Min Sub's wife.</i>

551
00:58:37,890 --> 00:58:39,380
The brother's wife?

552
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:41,580
Director.

553
00:58:41,580 --> 00:58:46,320
What if the victim messed with the brother's wife?

554
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:49,410
Im Min Sub.

555
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:51,960
Where is he right now?

556
00:58:54,970 --> 00:58:57,780
What did he do here?

557
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:02,150
What is it?

558
00:59:06,690 --> 00:59:08,520
What did this bastard do?

559
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:35,620
It's backwards.

560
01:00:06,750 --> 01:00:08,850
5 hundred million!

561
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:17,040
5 hundred million inside of this safe?

562
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:25,820
Kang Jong Yoon...

563
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:28,830
You broke into the safe.

564
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:32,420
Wait. Then...

565
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:36,980
Since the brother was the only other person who knew where the money was...

566
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:40,770
The revenge he wanted for his brother...

567
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:44,960
Two rats were fighting each other for this money...

568
01:00:49,830 --> 01:00:50,650
What?

569
01:00:50,650 --> 01:00:51,710
Senior!

570
01:00:51,710 --> 01:00:55,030
The Seoul team went to go catch Im Min Sub.

571
01:00:55,030 --> 01:00:56,380
What?

572
01:00:56,380 --> 01:00:57,410
Why Im Min Sub?

573
01:00:57,410 --> 01:01:00,360
He's now a suspect for this family murder.

574
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:05,200
He killed his own brother for sleeping with his wife.

575
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:08,090
Oh and the Cheval? That thing.

576
01:01:08,090 --> 01:01:11,190
<i>That purchase was found in his credit card transactions.</i>

577
01:01:11,190 --> 01:01:13,500
What the hell are they saying?

578
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:14,600
Im Min Sub?

579
01:01:16,570 --> 01:01:17,930
Where is he right now?

580
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:19,640
<i>I'll look into it.</i>

581
01:01:48,870 --> 01:01:51,340
Shut up!

582
01:01:56,140 --> 01:01:57,570
Who is it?

583
01:02:35,060 --> 01:02:36,510
Im Min Sub!

584
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:38,840
Im Min Sub?

585
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:13,270
Im Min Sub!

586
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:17,550
What happened?

587
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:23,020
Call the ambulance!

588
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:29,460
Get it together!

589
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:32,230
Im Min Sub...
Who did this?

590
01:03:34,630 --> 01:03:35,930
Kang...

591
01:03:38,610 --> 01:03:40,830
Jong Yoon...

592
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:22,820
Subtitles by CJ Entertainment

01:04:23,630 --> 01:04:26,310
<i>Director Yeo almost feel for it.</i>

594
01:04:26,310 --> 01:04:28,040
<i>Didn't I tell you?</i>

595
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:30,740
<i>This is a territory you'll never understand.</i>

596
01:04:30,740 --> 01:04:32,580
<i>Hell...</i>

597
01:04:34,150 --> 01:04:35,620
<i>Where did he go?</i>

598
01:04:36,190 --> 01:04:40,600
<i>What is he doing for us to keep looking for the criminal?</i>

599
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:42,810
<i>I guess there is something difficult for Yeo Ji Hoon.</i>

600
01:04:42,810 --> 01:04:45,340
<i>Come this way.
I have something to show you.</i>

601
01:04:46,070 --> 01:04:50,110
<i>Kang Jong Yoon is waiting for me...</i>

602
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:55,650
<i>Things are just coming together.</i>

603
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:58,570
<i>I don't understand why you're doing this.</i>

604
01:04:58,570 --> 01:05:01,610
<i>Like you said, I don't understand why you're doing this either!</i>
