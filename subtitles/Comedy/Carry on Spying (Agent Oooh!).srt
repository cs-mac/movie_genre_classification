1
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:34,810
Bavaria, August 1944

2
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,280
Come on! All aboard!

3
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,950
- Get on the train, Lieutenant!
- Right away.

4
00:00:46,659 --> 00:00:47,920
Come on! Come on! Aboard!

5
00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:50,909
All aboard!

6
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:54,189
Where were you? The train's leaving.

7
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,909
l know. l was at the doctor's.

8
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:01,039
Clemens, we're going to have a baby.

9
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:15,859
Lisa.

10
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:19,549
Daddy, will you send me a postcard?

11
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,469
l will.

12
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,129
Promise?

13
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:24,599
l promise.

14
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:28,400
A promise is a promise
that you never break.

15
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:31,329
No, l won't.

16
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:41,359
Last call, Lieutenant! All aboard!

17
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:44,189
Come on! All aboard!

18
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:46,290
l'll be back soon.

19
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:53,629
l promise.

20
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,680
l'll be back for Christmas!

21
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:21,180
As Far As My Feet Will Carry Me

22
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,509
Clemens Forell is hereby charged
with violating paragraphs 319 and 320.

23
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:34,460
The Court will now
pronounce judgement on him.

24
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,219
The defendant is guilty

25
00:02:38,669 --> 00:02:41,280
of crimes against the Partisans.

26
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:49,610
He is sentenced.

27
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:53,099
to 25 years of forced labor.

28
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,090
The sentence is in effect
starting today, 13 July 1945.

29
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:11,180
Forell!

30
00:03:15,139 --> 00:03:16,449
lt's your turn.

31
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,990
Everybody turn around!

32
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:02,710
He won't let go! He wont' let go!

33
00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:14,409
Hey, kid! It's me!

34
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,000
He won't hurt you now. He's dead.

35
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,730
Hello, Lisa.
l have something for you today.

36
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:46,449
Here... And now l get a kiss.

37
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,079
What a little hussy!

38
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:16,220
Good day!

39
00:05:17,329 --> 00:05:18,879
Good day! Lisa.

40
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,939
A letter from Clemens?

41
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:12,839
From the Red Cross:

42
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:19,290
We have no record of Clemens Forell
in our lists.

43
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,430
There is no information
about the Russian court martial.

44
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,300
They know nothing.

45
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:36,279
Nothing!

46
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:52,540
Everything will turn out all right...

47
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:06,430
Hail Mary... Mother of mercy.

48
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:12,029
Please, bring my father back home.

49
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,029
Daddy!

50
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,439
Hey, Danhorn.

51
00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:35,079
You were at the divisional headquarters.

52
00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:38,129
And you made maps.

53
00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:42,100
Yeah, and this is my reward.

54
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,689
Where's Cape Dezhnev?

55
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,170
Don't know much about geography, huh?

56
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:54,629
Okay...

57
00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:18,629
Here... from north to south...

58
00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:20,829
The Ural Mountains.

59
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:24,430
To the west...

60
00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:29,319
... that trivial place
we can now forget about: Europe.

61
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:37,070
The Irtysh River... is behind us.

62
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:41,320
We much be here now.

63
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,879
Further east near the Yenisey River.

64
00:08:46,769 --> 00:08:48,259
The Lena...

65
00:08:50,809 --> 00:08:53,419
... the Vitim... the little Olekma.

66
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:57,690
By the way, here everything is little

67
00:08:58,309 --> 00:09:00,299
if it's shorter than 1 ,OOO kilometers.

68
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,179
Cape Dezhnev

69
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:09,120
Yes, well... It's further east

70
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,240
northeast.

71
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:16,379
lt will take ages to get there.

72
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:20,429
We'll never get there.

73
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:22,669
They'll let us starve
and freeze to death first.

74
00:09:23,169 --> 00:09:24,720
Maybe we don't deserve any better.

75
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,529
We did our duty.

76
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:28,279
You were in the SA.

77
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:29,980
And l'm proud of it!

78
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:35,610
Stop it! Have you gone crazy?

79
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:39,879
- That's your last order, Captain!
- Hands off!

80
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:36,470
Four pieces each. Less than usual.

81
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,730
Clemens, we're going to have a baby!

82
00:11:53,789 --> 00:11:55,519
l'll be back for Christmas!

83
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:02,509
l said four pieces, bastard!

84
00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:19,549
Why do they get fed first?

85
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:23,070
You'll all get fed here! Understand?

86
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,940
What about the main course, Captain?

87
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:29,659
You won't have anything
to laugh about soon.

88
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,830
They're gonna let us die.

89
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,009
They uncoupled us, so we'll die.

90
00:14:18,429 --> 00:14:20,830
Mother, pray for me. Don't let me die.

91
00:14:21,299 --> 00:14:23,169
They're gonna let us die.

92
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:26,950
They're gonna shoot us.
They gotta shoot us.

93
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,250
Shut your fucking mouth! Nothing to eat!

94
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:33,460
Come on, kid! Pull yourself together!

95
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,159
My mother's last letter... gives me strength.

96
00:14:45,429 --> 00:14:46,950
Hide it under your lapel.

97
00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:49,450
Don't let them find it.

98
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,309
Try to sleep.

99
00:15:52,259 --> 00:15:54,070
- What's going on?
- l don't know.

100
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,909
They've come for us.
They're taking us away.

101
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,220
Where to?

102
00:19:38,089 --> 00:19:40,779
November, somewhere in Siberia.

103
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,579
This letter will never reach you.

104
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,259
lt will never be sent.

105
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,529
l can't even write it.

106
00:19:52,269 --> 00:19:55,609
l can hardly gather my thoughts
of what l want to say.

107
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:00,579
l saw that huge screeching wheel.

108
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:04,019
That terrible thing
which crushes everything.

109
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:10,289
But l also realize
that no pain is irrevocable.

110
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:13,319
But constant hope is.

111
00:20:42,779 --> 00:20:45,240
Cape Dezhnev Prison Camp, 1946
Headquarters

112
00:20:49,019 --> 00:20:52,680
You saved the company.
You crossed the front line.

113
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,599
That's why you got a medal.

114
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:01,450
- You'll have a drink?
- No, thank you.

115
00:21:07,009 --> 00:21:10,230
You could serve in the
western region or in Leningrad.

116
00:21:10,809 --> 00:21:14,240
lnstead, you are here in Cape Dezhnev. Why?

117
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:19,220
Because l feel it's my duty.

118
00:21:21,819 --> 00:21:23,250
The temptations of a woman!

119
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,420
Alright...

120
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,410
You are responsible for camp security.

121
00:21:30,099 --> 00:21:32,029
l hope you'll be able to cope with it.

122
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,500
Thank you for your confidence, Major.
l'll do my best.

123
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,769
Barracks!

124
00:21:59,829 --> 00:22:01,119
We made it!

125
00:22:29,619 --> 00:22:30,670
Typhoid.

126
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:36,309
We can't go on like this.

127
00:22:41,269 --> 00:22:46,160
We have penicillin. l know.
We got it from the Americans.

128
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:47,789
So, give it to me!

129
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:49,680
l'm warning you, Dr. Stauffer.

130
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:54,019
You're going to be responsible
if an epidemic breaks out!

131
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,059
Don't tell me what l'm responsible for!

132
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:59,779
Don't forget who's in charge here!

133
00:23:16,069 --> 00:23:18,119
You're needed to exam the prisoners.

134
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:20,650
We aren't finished, Lieutenant.

135
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:24,980
The Commander's orders.
And l'm here to carry them out.

136
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:31,920
- You're Dr. Stauffer?
- Yes, sir, Lieutenant!

137
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:38,630
You accompany Dr. Pachmutova.

138
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,160
There's a lot of work to do.

139
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:07,789
No fence! No watchtowers!

140
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,029
They don't need things like that
north of the Arctic Circle.

141
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:17,069
Where would you go anyway?
No trees, no bushes

142
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:20,400
not even a blade of grass to eat.

143
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:30,269
214, 215, 216.

144
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,279
A ship!

145
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:44,990
We're here at the eastern cape.
There must be a harbor around here.

146
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,859
Let's start again!

147
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:19,950
lt's very tedious, Dr. Stauffer.

148
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,390
But there is one great advantage.

149
00:25:24,099 --> 00:25:26,940
This way we'll find out
who's healthy and fit for work.

150
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:29,549
- Then you don't need us.
- Yes, l do.

151
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,380
For the death certificates.

152
00:25:52,529 --> 00:25:53,400
My letter.

153
00:25:54,859 --> 00:25:55,940
Quiet!

154
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,009
What are you hiding?

155
00:26:14,819 --> 00:26:15,779
Just a letter.

156
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:20,240
From my mother.

157
00:26:26,029 --> 00:26:28,019
Take off all your clothes!

158
00:27:14,609 --> 00:27:15,839
What are you doing?

159
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:19,990
Giving my coat to my comrade.

160
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,900
What are you doing?

161
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:30,259
So he doesn't freeze to death.

162
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:34,369
May l say something, Lieutenant?

163
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,309
No.

164
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:39,619
What's your name?

165
00:27:40,369 --> 00:27:41,920
Clemens Forell.

166
00:27:44,569 --> 00:27:46,089
Clemens Forell...

167
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:51,250
Keep your coat. You'll need it.

168
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:28,450
Long live Stalin

169
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:01,289
Keep going, Forell.

170
00:29:22,339 --> 00:29:23,480
What's wrong?

171
00:29:23,769 --> 00:29:28,630
l gotta get out. l can't take this anymore.
l can't stand it!

172
00:29:31,009 --> 00:29:34,289
Go out and join Mattern!
And you'll get your fresh air!

173
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:05,519
What? Are these our sleeping quarters?

174
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:41,029
- They'll be deloused.
- They'll be deloused.

175
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:47,619
We're supposed to take everything off.

176
00:31:55,089 --> 00:31:56,400
- l think this is mine.
- It's mine!

177
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,740
Let go!

178
00:32:41,369 --> 00:32:43,539
The National Committe of Free Germany.

179
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:48,200
Everyone who joins the right side
will get his chance.

180
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,369
- Forell, right?
- Clemens Forell.

181
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,910
- What's wrong?
- Daddy isn't dead.

182
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:08,400
No, Lisa. l'm sure he isn't.

183
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,789
Sorry, nothing.
l don't have any information.

184
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:23,769
That doesn't mean he's dead.

185
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:28,049
New negotiations with the Russians
will take place this autumn.

186
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:29,990
You have to wait.

187
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:33,710
Wait.

188
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:01,789
Damn light!

189
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,349
Danhorn! My God!

190
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:38,300
- Prisoner Forell!
- He's dead!

191
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,630
Comrade Lieutenant!

192
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:09,599
The engineer isn't here.
And that guy is too stupid.

193
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,630
Are you being treated well?

194
00:35:14,789 --> 00:35:15,929
l'm not complaining, but...

195
00:35:16,219 --> 00:35:17,510
Fine.

196
00:35:20,329 --> 00:35:22,409
Come on. Get the machine to work.

197
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,909
Me? How am l supposed to do that?

198
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:30,780
You're a mechanic, prisoner Forell.
It's in your file.

199
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,880
You don't mean to say it's wrong?

200
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,239
MS Alaska

201
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:55,650
Start it.

202
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,630
You speak Russian?

203
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:14,309
- That isn't mentioned in your file.
- Just a few words.

204
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:29,690
- Learn the right ones.
- Yeah.

205
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:06,329
Are you still alive, prisoner Forell?

206
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:12,440
- Yes.
- Louder!

207
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:20,500
Yes, sir! Lieutenant Kamenev!

208
00:39:21,329 --> 00:39:26,550
That's fine! Where were you going? Alaska?

209
00:39:29,739 --> 00:39:32,429
The Union of the Soviet Republics...

210
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:38,739
...had an agreement with
the United States of North America.

211
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:45,050
Even if you'd managed to escape,
they'd have sent you back.

212
00:39:47,789 --> 00:39:48,929
Attention!

213
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:04,789
That's fine.

214
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:34,070
You'll never leave this place.

215
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:36,949
You're going to be buried here.

216
00:40:39,409 --> 00:40:40,699
All of us.

217
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:43,639
Go on.

218
00:40:45,349 --> 00:40:47,219
Your comrades are waiting for you.

219
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:30,179
C'mon, Forell! We're waiting for you!

220
00:41:56,559 --> 00:42:03,039
Stop it! You gotta stop it! Stop it!

221
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:25,550
They really gave it to you.

222
00:42:27,219 --> 00:42:28,420
l'm not surprised.

223
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,599
They're hungry.

224
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:36,929
Nothing to eat for five days.

225
00:42:38,869 --> 00:42:40,269
Who's dump enough... to run away

226
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,239
the first chance he gets?

227
00:42:44,139 --> 00:42:45,480
You'll never get out that way.

228
00:42:49,239 --> 00:42:50,409
Will he make it?

229
00:42:52,679 --> 00:42:54,110
He's tough.

230
00:42:58,219 --> 00:43:00,590
Take him to... sick bay.

231
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:04,219
That's an order.

232
00:43:15,639 --> 00:43:16,869
He's running a high fever.

233
00:43:19,739 --> 00:43:21,260
l hope it isn't typhoid.

234
00:43:23,539 --> 00:43:25,150
Help me.

235
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:30,010
l have to... l have to write home.

236
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:39,159
lt will never arrive.

237
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:49,710
Hi there! Hi there!

238
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,539
- Here, you must eat some good food.
- That's too much. Thank you.

239
00:44:11,219 --> 00:44:15,289
Dear Dad, l want to write you a letter,

240
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,139
but l don't know where to send it.

241
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:21,030
Mom said that you're in Russia.

242
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:26,380
But Russia is so big, so far, so far away.

243
00:44:29,539 --> 00:44:31,909
l'd really like to see you again.

244
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:51,610
Do you know what this is?

245
00:44:53,869 --> 00:44:56,559
These aren't spider webs,
like Pachmutova says.

246
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:01,630
There aren't any spiders here, only lead.

247
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:05,099
- What do you mean?
- It causes lead poisoning.

248
00:45:07,179 --> 00:45:09,639
Typesetters are advised
to find a new profession.

249
00:45:10,449 --> 00:45:12,289
- And there's nothing you can do?
- No.

250
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:15,460
Everybody gets it sooner or later.

251
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:24,429
l gotta go home.

252
00:45:30,969 --> 00:45:33,280
Listen to me... Forell.

253
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:36,739
- You could make it.
- But how?

254
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:41,570
You have to be prepared.
You need the right clothes,

255
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:44,460
sturdy shoes, a compass.

256
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:48,010
How will you find food?
What if you run into other people?

257
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:50,630
How do you start a fire at 40 below?

258
00:45:51,219 --> 00:45:53,590
- l know it's possible.
- Be quiet!

259
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:56,349
You don't know a thing.

260
00:46:01,869 --> 00:46:03,860
lf you reach the Lena within a year,

261
00:46:04,539 --> 00:46:07,699
you can kneel down and thank God.

262
00:46:08,269 --> 00:46:11,400
The Lena is in the middle of Siberia.

263
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:14,489
Yeah.

264
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:17,449
l can help you.

265
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:42,429
- Reuter?
- Fit for work.

266
00:46:45,039 --> 00:46:46,059
Baier?

267
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:51,739
Fit for work.

268
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:55,909
Klugmann?

269
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,639
l cleaned everything. You see?

270
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:05,349
Everything's clean.
Spiders don't have a chance here.

271
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,480
Fit for work.

272
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:12,829
As soon as you get up...

273
00:47:21,409 --> 00:47:22,519
Fever.

274
00:47:26,349 --> 00:47:27,550
Penicillin.

275
00:47:30,619 --> 00:47:32,349
- He's fit for work.
- No.

276
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:34,429
- l think so!
- He has a fever!

277
00:47:34,789 --> 00:47:36,630
You don't decide, Dr. Stauffer.

278
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:38,610
l'm responsible here.

279
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,239
l'm responsible for who gets admitted
and who gets released.

280
00:47:50,179 --> 00:47:51,139
Fit for work.

281
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:00,449
Come see me tonight.

282
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,260
- Any problems?
- No. okay.

283
00:49:07,519 --> 00:49:08,480
Come here.

284
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:14,179
Danhorn drew this map
while he was still alive.

285
00:49:15,030 --> 00:49:16,610
Of course, it might not be precise.

286
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,239
A river that runs like this
can change its course.

287
00:49:19,699 --> 00:49:23,360
The rivers are frozen in the winter
but they're like an ocean in the summer.

288
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,579
You'll have to wait for the next winter...

289
00:49:28,010 --> 00:49:28,880
Get in there!

290
00:49:37,619 --> 00:49:39,320
Do you need me, Lieutenant?

291
00:49:46,059 --> 00:49:48,690
You work too long, Dr. Stauffer.

292
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:01,380
- Why don't you... have a swig.
- Thanks.

293
00:50:05,409 --> 00:50:07,159
Thank you. It hits the spot.

294
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,260
Where did you get this?

295
00:50:17,019 --> 00:50:18,659
Approved by Command Headquarters.

296
00:50:20,090 --> 00:50:23,369
l need it to cut splints
for fractured bones.

297
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,500
We're out of everything.

298
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,829
Don't work any longer tonight.

299
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:41,309
- Turn off the light.
- Yeah.

300
00:50:46,389 --> 00:50:48,909
- Good night.
- Good night.

301
00:51:03,739 --> 00:51:07,369
We were lucky. There's no time left.
l can't tell you everything.

302
00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:14,489
Come here. My sweater. The boots.

303
00:51:16,449 --> 00:51:19,349
Wear everything during the day.
Take some things off at night,

304
00:51:19,889 --> 00:51:23,489
and loosely cover yourself with them.
Come on, let's get started.

305
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:27,170
- You have to show me just how...
- Do you want to escape? Yes or no?

306
00:51:27,659 --> 00:51:30,179
- Of course l do!
- But only today! Now!

307
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:34,949
lf you don't leave tonight, you'll go
back in the mine and never come out!

308
00:51:40,610 --> 00:51:43,710
l've hidden supplies on the hill
where the train goes past.

309
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:47,380
Dried bread and lard
two kilos of machorka!.

310
00:51:47,949 --> 00:51:50,320
Don't smoke it. You'll need it for trading.

311
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:55,460
A spirit cooker, a compass.
Snow shoes, too.

312
00:51:56,719 --> 00:51:58,179
Where did you get all that?

313
00:51:58,619 --> 00:52:01,809
lt was actually for my escape.

314
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:10,050
Here.

315
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:14,130
Carry it under you clothing.
Right next to your belly.

316
00:52:14,739 --> 00:52:18,110
lt's loaded. Eight spare bullets.

317
00:52:19,179 --> 00:52:21,519
They'll shoot you on the spot
if they find you with it.

318
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:24,980
Why don't you escape yourself?

319
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,360
There's a danger of losing your voice.

320
00:52:27,949 --> 00:52:30,639
Talk to yourself.
Talk to trees if you have to.

321
00:52:33,329 --> 00:52:34,760
Take this along with you, too.

322
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:39,809
l scratched my address on it.

323
00:52:42,269 --> 00:52:45,079
From my wife in Magdeburg.

324
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:51,469
Tell her l prepared everything
for my escape.

325
00:52:54,179 --> 00:52:57,690
Yeah. Why don't l escape?

326
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:02,960
Two months ago, l stopped fooling myself.

327
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:06,150
Cancer.

328
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,300
l just have one request, Forell.
If you make it back,

329
00:53:13,630 --> 00:53:15,300
go see my wife.

330
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:18,880
Tell her that l sent you, and tell her...

331
00:53:21,710 --> 00:53:24,489
....that l died in the winter of '50.

332
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:26,909
February.

333
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:29,429
Describe the grave to her.

334
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:36,179
Tell her...
Tell her there's a cross on my grave.

335
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:45,989
No, wait... Tell her it was May.

336
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:52,260
She'll picture it with flowers.
That'll be more like spring.

337
00:53:55,909 --> 00:53:57,369
Promise me?

338
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:07,179
Yeah, okay... don't forget the map.

339
00:54:08,050 --> 00:54:11,179
Here, take the knife with you.
l don't need it anymore.

340
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:14,750
You have a head start
till tomorrow morning. It's not enough.

341
00:54:15,389 --> 00:54:16,289
They'll look for you to the west.

342
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:18,639
Go north to the sea and along the coast.

343
00:54:19,059 --> 00:54:20,519
lt's safer!

344
00:54:29,739 --> 00:54:31,469
Come on, please.

345
00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:38,980
l beg you.

346
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:41,369
- Excuse me.
- l beg you. Wait.

347
00:54:41,789 --> 00:54:43,960
Please, allow me. l'll take care of it.

348
00:54:46,159 --> 00:54:48,469
You see, that's what the German does.

349
00:54:49,190 --> 00:54:51,000
He'll take care of it.

350
00:54:52,099 --> 00:54:54,619
He's glad that he can work.

351
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:56,829
And the two of us can...

352
00:54:57,170 --> 00:54:58,539
l'm warning you.

353
00:54:59,809 --> 00:55:03,849
l'm warning you! If you don't stop
flirting with the Germans,

354
00:55:04,539 --> 00:55:06,469
- especially with that Forell...
- What?

355
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:09,840
What? Maybe you two
already have something going!

356
00:57:19,710 --> 00:57:22,840
Stauffer! Stand up when l talk to you!

357
00:59:39,250 --> 00:59:40,389
Get up!

358
00:59:41,849 --> 00:59:43,340
Get up, bastard!

359
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:46,130
Get to work!

360
00:59:48,530 --> 00:59:51,280
Only if my men get something decent
to eat. Or we won't work.

361
00:59:53,130 --> 00:59:54,969
You know who's to blame.

362
00:59:56,070 --> 00:59:58,119
You're blaming us, too. That isn't fair.

363
00:59:58,539 --> 01:00:00,880
You talk about fairness!

364
01:00:04,010 --> 01:00:04,940
Yes.

365
01:00:06,679 --> 01:00:07,699
You can kill us all

366
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:09,679
but we will never beat
one of our comrades again.

367
01:00:55,389 --> 01:00:58,730
Lieutenant, the search patrol reports back.

368
01:00:59,730 --> 01:01:00,989
What do you have to report?

369
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,449
We combed the plains to the west.

370
01:01:03,869 --> 01:01:06,010
All the way to the foothills.

371
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:08,019
He couldn't have gone that far.

372
01:01:08,369 --> 01:01:10,920
We've been gone for five days.
We're completely exhausted.

373
01:01:11,409 --> 01:01:13,659
l believe he's buried under the snow.

374
01:01:14,110 --> 01:01:16,300
You are expected to carry out orders!

375
01:01:16,750 --> 01:01:19,909
You failed to do the job! Go on!

376
01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:25,880
You've lost control over the camp.

377
01:01:27,030 --> 01:01:29,079
You didn't fulfill your duty.

378
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:31,769
One of them escaped.

379
01:01:34,599 --> 01:01:36,119
You shot one.

380
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:38,170
That is sabotage.

381
01:01:40,570 --> 01:01:42,179
He put up resistance.

382
01:01:42,539 --> 01:01:46,440
Okay, let's assume that's right.

383
01:01:47,710 --> 01:01:51,630
And Forell may have frozen to death.

384
01:01:56,119 --> 01:01:57,760
Write that in your report.

385
01:02:08,429 --> 01:02:11,559
No... he isn't dead.

386
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,429
Our Father... who art in Heaven...

387
01:04:25,769 --> 01:04:27,760
Give us our daily bread...

388
01:04:30,610 --> 01:04:37,670
My bread... give me it now!

389
01:08:09,860 --> 01:08:13,400
l'm sorry, but l need your fat.

390
01:08:19,739 --> 01:08:21,229
l have to go home.

391
01:08:58,439 --> 01:09:03,220
997, 998, 999...

392
01:09:17,130 --> 01:09:18,300
3,OOO

393
01:09:31,409 --> 01:09:38,939
001 , 002, 003, 004...

394
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:11,390
You're... you're a tree! A tree!

395
01:11:12,039 --> 01:11:13,619
You're a tree!

396
01:11:18,949 --> 01:11:20,180
l'm gonna make it!

397
01:11:23,319 --> 01:11:24,340
l'm gonna make it.

398
01:12:05,029 --> 01:12:07,250
Have all stations been informed?

399
01:12:07,770 --> 01:12:10,789
Yes, within a radius of 500 kilometers.

400
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:20,539
lncrease the radius.

401
01:12:22,909 --> 01:12:27,250
He can go further than
500 kilometers in two months.

402
01:12:55,380 --> 01:12:56,810
Drop your guns!

403
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:02,300
lt's all right.

404
01:13:03,390 --> 01:13:05,119
We don't want anything from you.

405
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:08,729
We easily could have shot you already.

406
01:13:09,329 --> 01:13:12,930
But we're hunters and gold-diggers.

407
01:13:13,699 --> 01:13:15,310
ln the summer, we wash gold.

408
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,699
And in the winter, we hunt.

409
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:19,949
We saw the fire.

410
01:13:20,340 --> 01:13:22,859
And we thought we'd take a look.

411
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:29,500
You must be German. And you ran away?

412
01:13:40,829 --> 01:13:42,699
lt will be light soon.

413
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:46,909
A snowstorm is approaching.

414
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:49,140
You must look for a safe place.

415
01:13:49,529 --> 01:13:53,539
We know a safe place.
Come on. Let's go.

416
01:13:54,439 --> 01:13:57,569
l don't need you two. Go away.

417
01:13:58,680 --> 01:13:59,880
Go away!

418
01:14:01,979 --> 01:14:05,380
Whatever you say. Let's go!

419
01:14:05,979 --> 01:14:07,590
Anastas!

420
01:14:08,590 --> 01:14:10,020
What's taking you?

421
01:15:14,590 --> 01:15:17,720
So, you still don't believe us?

422
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:22,159
l'm Semyon. What's your name?

423
01:15:22,689 --> 01:15:23,920
Pjotr.

424
01:15:24,229 --> 01:15:26,949
Right. Don't trust anybody.

425
01:15:27,460 --> 01:15:30,210
And never tell anyone your real name.

426
01:15:32,069 --> 01:15:32,970
Come with us.

427
01:15:33,239 --> 01:15:35,380
You'll never make it alone in Siberia.

428
01:15:51,619 --> 01:15:54,840
lt's becoming spring, Lisa.
l'm on my way to you.

429
01:15:56,329 --> 01:15:57,850
Should l thank God for that

430
01:15:58,329 --> 01:16:00,109
or my Siberian companions?

431
01:16:01,569 --> 01:16:05,000
lt's just a small piece
of the way l have to go.

432
01:16:05,939 --> 01:16:08,659
Semyon said it was 1 O,OOO verst,

433
01:16:09,270 --> 01:16:10,670
and then he laughed.

434
01:16:11,909 --> 01:16:13,640
Semyon is always laughing.

435
01:16:44,069 --> 01:16:46,210
When will we reach
the Kalyma Mountains?

436
01:16:47,380 --> 01:16:50,369
ln two days, maybe in three.

437
01:16:54,819 --> 01:16:56,399
But the river flows north.

438
01:16:57,720 --> 01:17:00,819
No, 500 kilometers to the west.

439
01:17:03,890 --> 01:17:07,289
Take me home, Anastas... On this raft.

440
01:17:08,829 --> 01:17:10,439
We're crossing the Caucasians.

441
01:17:12,239 --> 01:17:15,199
You'll make it. If anybody can, he can.

442
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:18,010
lt would be possible.

443
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:21,449
But actually you shouldn't leave.

444
01:17:23,010 --> 01:17:25,090
Look around you. How magnificent.

445
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:27,220
Siberia is!

446
01:17:27,579 --> 01:17:29,189
Fertile and beautiful.

447
01:17:30,420 --> 01:17:32,170
You can be very happy here.

448
01:17:35,430 --> 01:17:36,720
Okay, Pjotr.

449
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,140
You take the oar.

450
01:17:42,569 --> 01:17:44,850
Now show us what you've learned.

451
01:17:54,140 --> 01:17:56,100
Stay to the left!

452
01:17:56,810 --> 01:17:59,970
Anastas! Straight ahead!

453
01:19:53,359 --> 01:20:02,529
Anastas would have let me drown.

454
01:20:03,939 --> 01:20:06,310
Thank you, Petja.

455
01:20:51,619 --> 01:20:54,430
Eat, Pjotr. Eat.

456
01:20:55,289 --> 01:20:58,220
You can eat these leaves.
l'll teach you everything.

457
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,810
Why did you take me with you?

458
01:21:02,399 --> 01:21:05,529
We ran away from the goldmines.

459
01:21:06,100 --> 01:21:10,899
Anastas thought that
you might give us away.

460
01:21:11,710 --> 01:21:15,079
Sooner or later
they'd have caught you anyway.

461
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:18,810
- But now you're one of us.
- No!

462
01:22:04,109 --> 01:22:07,270
No, l didn't drown!

463
01:22:07,850 --> 01:22:10,569
What should l have done?
Deserted the raft with all our supplies?

464
01:22:11,079 --> 01:22:14,300
- Where's my pack?
- It's gone. It sank.

465
01:22:19,890 --> 01:22:21,529
Hey, it's all here!

466
01:22:27,199 --> 01:22:28,460
What happened to my things?

467
01:22:29,329 --> 01:22:31,350
l thought maybe you had some salt.

468
01:22:32,470 --> 01:22:33,779
We haven't had salt for a long time.

469
01:22:42,510 --> 01:22:44,239
What do you need that for anyway?

470
01:22:46,380 --> 01:22:49,920
There are cities and streets here
that you've never heard of before.

471
01:22:52,359 --> 01:22:54,729
The rivers are being re-routed.

472
01:22:55,359 --> 01:22:57,260
Everywhere they're building,
researching and collectivizing.

473
01:22:57,659 --> 01:23:00,380
That's how it is in the Soviet Union today.

474
01:23:02,930 --> 01:23:05,069
Do you have any salt perhaps?

475
01:23:09,569 --> 01:23:12,119
Didn't you check... to see?

476
01:23:17,279 --> 01:23:19,420
What an idiot l am!

477
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:31,989
Salt!

478
01:23:37,300 --> 01:23:38,909
Vodka!

479
01:23:41,710 --> 01:23:42,970
Vodka!

480
01:23:43,409 --> 01:23:49,239
What luck, Petruchka! Vodka!

481
01:24:22,149 --> 01:24:23,460
Why did you kill him?

482
01:24:25,020 --> 01:24:26,310
Why do you think?

483
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:40,090
We have to bury him.

484
01:24:43,270 --> 01:24:44,670
He'll be taken care of now by the wolves.

485
01:24:45,369 --> 01:24:47,680
He wanted to steal my gold.

486
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:54,119
Listen, Petja.
Take your things and let's go.

487
01:24:54,979 --> 01:25:00,630
We'll get by without him. Come on.

488
01:25:25,939 --> 01:25:28,930
l'm heading home, step by step.

489
01:25:29,510 --> 01:25:31,319
Even if l have to go roundabout ways.

490
01:25:31,949 --> 01:25:35,640
This is what l've learned:
The southern route to the west

491
01:25:36,289 --> 01:25:39,920
goes north sometimes, towards the east.

492
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:47,600
l'm done with. l can't go on.

493
01:25:48,430 --> 01:25:51,329
We'll make it, Semyon.

494
01:25:52,399 --> 01:25:55,390
We have to go on.
Give me your pack. l'll carry it.

495
01:25:55,939 --> 01:25:58,430
That's very nice of you.

496
01:25:59,079 --> 01:26:02,300
But there's only enough gold for one of us!

497
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:04,520
For one of us!

498
01:26:21,369 --> 01:26:22,359
Lisa.

499
01:26:28,909 --> 01:26:31,520
lt was just a dream. Just a dream.

500
01:26:34,510 --> 01:26:36,470
Clam down, sweetheart.

501
01:26:38,579 --> 01:26:41,039
l'm thirsty.

502
01:26:42,250 --> 01:26:44,270
- l'll get you something.
- Okay.

503
01:26:45,119 --> 01:26:48,020
Okay! You're talking like a Yankee.

504
01:26:50,460 --> 01:26:54,119
- You dreamed about Daddy again.
- Yes.

505
01:28:06,739 --> 01:28:09,260
lt's me, Kolka!

506
01:28:10,140 --> 01:28:13,329
And that's... Alyoshka!

507
01:30:30,949 --> 01:30:32,149
Prisoner of war...

508
01:30:37,550 --> 01:30:39,630
You talked in your sleep.

509
01:30:44,090 --> 01:30:45,869
This is Irina.

510
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:50,270
Her grandfather healed you.

511
01:30:51,539 --> 01:30:54,939
He heals everyone who is ill.

512
01:30:55,710 --> 01:30:58,729
But he couldn't help her husband.

513
01:30:59,609 --> 01:31:01,720
The bears tore him apart.

514
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:05,960
My wife.

515
01:31:07,250 --> 01:31:08,859
My son.

516
01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:15,630
l have to go away.

517
01:31:16,430 --> 01:31:18,890
For a long time, with the dogs.

518
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:21,489
But don't be afraid.

519
01:31:21,829 --> 01:31:24,199
No one will harm you here.

520
01:31:25,399 --> 01:31:28,970
But you must drink and eat,

521
01:31:29,640 --> 01:31:31,859
so you get your strength back.

522
01:31:33,109 --> 01:31:35,329
- Okay?
- Yes...

523
01:31:36,510 --> 01:31:38,529
l am Clemens.

524
01:35:30,750 --> 01:35:31,949
This is all we know about him.

525
01:35:32,250 --> 01:35:33,649
The keys.

526
01:35:34,649 --> 01:35:35,439
He wanted to buy a passport
with the gold he stole.

527
01:35:35,689 --> 01:35:38,149
- Imagine that, Comrade Kamenev.
- l'm not interested in him.

528
01:35:38,789 --> 01:35:42,010
l need the other man mentioned
in the report, a German.

529
01:35:42,859 --> 01:35:47,199
- Did he talk about the German?
- Yes, sir, Comrade Kamenev.

530
01:35:48,630 --> 01:35:50,939
Ask him yourself if that's
the German you're looking for.

531
01:36:13,960 --> 01:36:19,380
Attention! State Security asks
all residents of Yakutsk for their help.

532
01:36:20,260 --> 01:36:22,810
Be on the lookout for
a German spy named Pjotr.

533
01:36:23,300 --> 01:36:25,609
His real name is Clemens Forell.

534
01:37:00,699 --> 01:37:03,010
Forell, l have a son!

535
01:37:04,439 --> 01:37:08,010
He's my son! Mine!
What a great little guy!

536
01:37:08,649 --> 01:37:10,899
Look how big he is!

537
01:37:11,350 --> 01:37:13,659
He's going to be a real giant!

538
01:37:14,819 --> 01:37:16,600
Do you have a son?

539
01:37:18,789 --> 01:37:19,989
l don't know.

540
01:37:20,659 --> 01:37:22,560
- l hope so.
- You'll find out.

541
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:26,909
l'm sure you'll find out.

542
01:37:45,750 --> 01:37:47,090
They're looking for you.

543
01:37:48,020 --> 01:37:49,479
lt's too dangerous for you.

544
01:37:54,890 --> 01:37:57,579
l have to go away.

545
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:31,189
Aljoshka will take you
to the great forests.

546
01:38:31,689 --> 01:38:34,710
And then...

547
01:38:36,430 --> 01:38:38,159
... you'll be on your own.

548
01:38:44,739 --> 01:38:46,319
Thank you for everything.

549
01:38:51,609 --> 01:38:52,600
Argish!

550
01:39:00,619 --> 01:39:04,810
He likes you and will go with you.

551
01:39:05,529 --> 01:39:09,279
He's a good hunting dog,
and a small bone is all he needs.

552
01:39:09,970 --> 01:39:13,399
- Alright... good luck.
- Thank you.

553
01:41:15,260 --> 01:41:16,689
Ringing cedar.

554
01:41:19,399 --> 01:41:21,890
lt will protect you.

555
01:41:30,939 --> 01:41:33,020
The spirit of the shaman is with you.

556
01:41:54,359 --> 01:41:58,930
Go home and... forget my name.

557
01:42:14,720 --> 01:42:19,409
Go now! Go!

558
01:42:33,970 --> 01:42:37,189
Argish, go and look after him.

559
01:43:31,060 --> 01:43:34,399
Summer 1951

560
01:44:30,989 --> 01:44:33,130
Hey there! Don't move!

561
01:44:35,829 --> 01:44:37,670
Come here! Move it!

562
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:51,949
- What's your name?
- Answer the Comrade Inspector!

563
01:44:54,409 --> 01:44:57,979
Pjotr Ivanovich. l'm from the Baltic.

564
01:44:58,710 --> 01:45:01,319
My 8 years of forced labor are over.

565
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:04,760
l have to report to the
Rayon commander of the MWD in...

566
01:45:05,289 --> 01:45:15,260
... Chita. Here.

567
01:45:18,329 --> 01:45:19,970
You have a permit?

568
01:45:22,140 --> 01:45:23,340
No, l don't.

569
01:45:24,069 --> 01:45:26,090
- But... An l.D.?
- Yes...

570
01:45:27,310 --> 01:45:30,529
But it's being sent by courier.

571
01:45:31,810 --> 01:45:33,979
Otherwise l could escape.

572
01:45:34,420 --> 01:45:35,850
With an l.D.

573
01:45:41,159 --> 01:45:44,260
l know all about you bastards.

574
01:45:46,060 --> 01:45:48,810
You know how far it is to Chita?

575
01:45:51,529 --> 01:45:54,159
Far. Very far.

576
01:45:54,970 --> 01:45:57,050
800 kilometers.

577
01:46:00,210 --> 01:46:02,460
- Damn dog!
- He's hungry.

578
01:46:03,810 --> 01:46:06,060
We didn't find much to eat in the forest.

579
01:46:34,909 --> 01:46:38,890
Got out and have them give you some food.

580
01:46:45,590 --> 01:46:48,220
Thank you, Comrade Inspector.

581
01:46:56,800 --> 01:46:58,090
We have to report him.

582
01:46:58,399 --> 01:47:03,470
We will, but first we have
to send off our freight.

583
01:47:24,729 --> 01:47:26,369
You're lucky!

584
01:47:27,029 --> 01:47:28,729
There's a freight train going to Chita.

585
01:47:29,100 --> 01:47:30,710
You're going along as the brakeman.

586
01:47:31,130 --> 01:47:33,319
Make sure no tramps hitch a ride.

587
01:47:33,770 --> 01:47:35,500
You check the chains.

588
01:47:35,869 --> 01:47:37,180
- You understand?
- Yeah.

589
01:47:37,909 --> 01:47:38,989
Let's go!

590
01:47:39,279 --> 01:47:42,090
- Bye!
- Good luck.

591
01:48:25,689 --> 01:48:26,649
Attention!

592
01:48:33,930 --> 01:48:36,329
Comrade Lieutenant
the unit is ready for act'ion!

593
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:38,609
Commanding officer... Lieutenant Zykov.

594
01:48:39,770 --> 01:48:41,409
- How many men?
- Fifteen.

595
01:48:43,869 --> 01:48:45,270
- Button up your jacket.
- Sorry.

596
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:07,770
Hey, come on. We're here.

597
01:49:35,560 --> 01:49:37,109
We gotta go!

598
01:49:54,779 --> 01:49:56,090
He isn't here!

599
01:49:56,949 --> 01:49:58,260
At the front of the train!

600
01:50:08,760 --> 01:50:10,020
Be quiet!

601
01:50:19,899 --> 01:50:23,210
Almost on time, Prisoner Forell.

602
01:50:27,739 --> 01:50:29,609
Argish! Stop it!

603
01:53:36,500 --> 01:53:40,369
lt is walled within the ground,
then formed and fired from clay.

604
01:53:41,270 --> 01:53:44,930
Hurry, come around, craftsmen,
the ball must be finished today.

605
01:53:51,810 --> 01:53:55,619
lt is walled within the ground,
then formed and fired from clay.

606
01:53:58,250 --> 01:54:02,029
Craftsmen, hurry, come around,
the bell must be finished today.

607
01:54:02,689 --> 01:54:04,359
Learn as much as you can.

608
01:54:04,960 --> 01:54:06,600
Keep on learning.

609
01:54:07,329 --> 01:54:10,460
The Wanderer's Night Song

610
01:54:11,029 --> 01:54:14,720
Hush'd on the hill the breeze; Scarce by
the zephyr the trees softly are pressed

611
01:54:15,369 --> 01:54:20,289
The woodbird's asleep on the bough.
Wait then, and thou.

612
01:54:21,109 --> 01:54:24,590
Soon will find rest.

613
01:54:31,189 --> 01:54:33,090
That was very nice. Elisabeth.

614
01:54:37,890 --> 01:54:39,180
Go to your seat.

615
01:54:41,800 --> 01:54:43,260
Who else has memorized a poem?

616
01:54:44,930 --> 01:54:45,949
Rudolf.

617
01:56:10,840 --> 01:56:13,649
Central Asian U.S.S.R., August 1952

618
01:59:57,500 --> 02:00:00,779
Lord, forgive my sins...

619
02:00:04,810 --> 02:00:06,069
Forgive me.

620
02:00:06,739 --> 02:00:10,220
Wonders will never cease!

621
02:00:11,479 --> 02:00:18,039
A German asks for forgiveness.

622
02:00:23,890 --> 02:00:25,350
You're obvious.

623
02:00:27,300 --> 02:00:30,170
There are lots of poor destitutes here,

624
02:00:30,699 --> 02:00:33,279
but l've never seen
a German destitute here before.

625
02:00:35,270 --> 02:00:36,789
lf you pardon the expression,

626
02:00:37,140 --> 02:00:39,449
you have quite a strong odor.

627
02:00:41,180 --> 02:00:44,079
You can freshen up at my home.

628
02:00:51,949 --> 02:00:53,819
l want to help you.

629
02:00:59,029 --> 02:01:00,520
ls it a long way?

630
02:01:00,859 --> 02:01:02,789
You have trouble walking?

631
02:01:16,039 --> 02:01:18,699
lt's better to take the side streets.

632
02:02:11,130 --> 02:02:13,939
Soviet Police Headquarters

633
02:02:30,319 --> 02:02:31,430
Come with me.

634
02:03:04,189 --> 02:03:05,590
My brothers...

635
02:03:08,359 --> 02:03:09,850
We came from Poland.

636
02:03:11,390 --> 02:03:13,439
l went to the Soviet Union
and they went to Gdansk.

637
02:03:13,859 --> 02:03:15,380
An uncle of ours lived there.

638
02:03:23,340 --> 02:03:25,449
l burned it...

639
02:03:25,869 --> 02:03:30,260
... when l received the news
that... that also...

640
02:03:34,850 --> 02:03:36,369
Take sugar.

641
02:03:45,960 --> 02:03:47,600
Were you in a camp?

642
02:04:05,680 --> 02:04:09,220
Why did you burn the photograph
of your brothers?

643
02:04:10,850 --> 02:04:13,430
Because l can't look them in the eyes.

644
02:04:15,359 --> 02:04:16,880
l'm sorry.

645
02:04:18,060 --> 02:04:19,520
That's easily said.

646
02:04:22,899 --> 02:04:25,039
What shall we do with you now?

647
02:04:26,300 --> 02:04:28,000
You need a passport.

648
02:04:28,869 --> 02:04:31,909
- A passport?
- You can't cross the border otherwise.

649
02:04:33,109 --> 02:04:36,829
Do you have a name
that you've chosen for yourself?

650
02:04:39,609 --> 02:04:42,220
- Pjotr.
- Pjotr.

651
02:04:44,149 --> 02:04:46,340
Pjotr Ivanovich Ulyanov.

652
02:04:47,520 --> 02:04:51,090
That's about as common here
as Hans Peter Muller in Germany.

653
02:04:54,659 --> 02:04:56,300
Why are you doing this for me?

654
02:04:58,430 --> 02:05:00,739
You want to know
why a Jew would help a German?

655
02:05:01,199 --> 02:05:03,890
Although you Germans killed my brothers.

656
02:05:10,149 --> 02:05:11,989
Not all of us knew about it.

657
02:05:13,619 --> 02:05:15,109
Of course not.

658
02:05:15,720 --> 02:05:19,470
You'd have fought
to save women and children.

659
02:05:20,119 --> 02:05:23,189
You'd have killed
your commanding officer instead.

660
02:05:24,529 --> 02:05:30,159
But you didn't know a thing.
They kept it a secret.

661
02:05:31,069 --> 02:05:34,140
You only did your duty.

662
02:05:39,939 --> 02:05:42,279
l'm doing my duty, too.

663
02:05:44,079 --> 02:05:47,239
We'll prepare a bath for you now.

664
02:05:52,789 --> 02:05:55,250
l feel a bit queasy.

665
02:06:52,380 --> 02:06:54,079
At least the haircut fits.

666
02:06:55,649 --> 02:06:57,430
Wait here.

667
02:06:57,819 --> 02:07:00,039
lt could take a few hours.

668
02:07:00,489 --> 02:07:02,859
When l leave, l turn off the lights.

669
02:07:04,729 --> 02:07:06,779
Stay here in the dark.

670
02:07:07,659 --> 02:07:10,529
- Try to sleep.
- Alright.

671
02:08:04,989 --> 02:08:06,539
No confidence?

672
02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:11,149
l've learned to be careful.

673
02:08:11,590 --> 02:08:14,199
You have to learn to trust people again.

674
02:08:20,170 --> 02:08:22,039
Your passport and travel permit.

675
02:08:22,439 --> 02:08:24,659
The trip costs nothing.

676
02:08:25,109 --> 02:08:26,840
A Soviet achievement.

677
02:08:28,180 --> 02:08:31,140
Now listen, Pjotr Ivanovich Ulyanov.

678
02:08:31,680 --> 02:08:34,340
You're Latvian. That explains your accent.

679
02:08:34,850 --> 02:08:36,779
Memorize the information.

680
02:08:37,989 --> 02:08:39,739
You have to hurry now.

681
02:08:40,119 --> 02:08:42,699
The meeting place is
at the end of the street.

682
02:08:50,829 --> 02:08:52,640
Why are you doing this for me?

683
02:08:53,029 --> 02:08:54,930
Do you have a bad conscience,

684
02:08:55,340 --> 02:08:57,710
because you didn't help a Jew?

685
02:08:59,140 --> 02:09:01,630
You'll have to sort that out yourself.

686
02:09:03,109 --> 02:09:06,859
Go now. With a little luck, you'll make it.

687
02:09:21,329 --> 02:09:22,729
Thank you.

688
02:10:01,199 --> 02:10:02,949
What's wrong?

689
02:10:04,310 --> 02:10:06,449
l've heard of your hospitality.

690
02:10:06,880 --> 02:10:08,430
May l come in?

691
02:11:00,760 --> 02:11:03,890
Daddy, will you send me a postcard?

692
02:11:08,170 --> 02:11:11,239
This postcard, please.

693
02:11:16,909 --> 02:11:18,609
20 copecks.

694
02:11:53,180 --> 02:11:59,510
We have our suspicions about you.
But no evidence.

695
02:12:04,789 --> 02:12:06,079
But who needs evidence!

696
02:12:06,390 --> 02:12:10,430
You don't think that l'd help a German.

697
02:12:14,970 --> 02:12:18,810
l just have to know where he is.

698
02:12:20,810 --> 02:12:22,590
Understand?

699
02:12:35,060 --> 02:12:38,310
Yes, l helped him.

700
02:12:39,729 --> 02:12:42,310
And l'd to it again.

701
02:12:42,800 --> 02:12:48,569
l'd help anyone. Understand?

702
02:13:28,640 --> 02:13:29,899
There's been a landslide.

703
02:13:30,210 --> 02:13:32,640
You'll have to make a detour.

704
02:13:33,109 --> 02:13:34,720
That'll take us out of our way.

705
02:13:35,079 --> 02:13:36,369
What can l do?

706
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:38,939
ls it possible to walk there?

707
02:13:39,220 --> 02:13:42,380
Yes, but it's very far.

708
02:14:30,439 --> 02:14:31,810
How did you get here?

709
02:14:32,069 --> 02:14:34,500
There was a landslide in the mountains.

710
02:14:38,409 --> 02:14:40,520
That's why l walked.

711
02:14:40,949 --> 02:14:44,640
You walked?... It's very far.

712
02:14:45,550 --> 02:14:46,510
Yes.

713
02:14:48,460 --> 02:14:53,239
You see... l have to cross the border today.

714
02:14:54,029 --> 02:14:58,250
Here... valid on 13 August.

715
02:15:00,699 --> 02:15:03,770
The Iranians probably
won't let me cross tomorrow.

716
02:15:05,539 --> 02:15:09,380
Yes, the Iranians probably
won't let you in.

717
02:15:55,619 --> 02:15:56,880
You can go across.

718
02:16:00,260 --> 02:16:01,250
Thanks.

719
02:16:46,200 --> 02:16:47,700
Glory to the Red Army

720
02:18:20,700 --> 02:18:22,840
lt's my victory.

721
02:19:11,920 --> 02:19:15,260
Teheran Federal Prison, December 1952

722
02:19:33,309 --> 02:19:35,590
We believe that he's a Russian spy.

723
02:19:36,040 --> 02:19:37,940
He'll be sentenced to death.

724
02:19:40,049 --> 02:19:41,340
He calls himself Clemens Forell and says

725
02:19:41,649 --> 02:19:44,780
he escaped from Siberia's eastern shore.

726
02:19:45,350 --> 02:19:47,190
He says it took him 3 years to get here.

727
02:19:48,219 --> 02:19:51,120
lt sounds so incredible
that it might even be true.

728
02:19:51,659 --> 02:19:53,440
That is why l granted his request

729
02:19:53,829 --> 02:19:56,520
and asked you to come and identify him.

730
02:20:00,739 --> 02:20:06,950
The last time l saw him was 1937.

731
02:20:07,940 --> 02:20:10,489
Before l was appointed to
the Ministry of Economics in Ankara.

732
02:20:13,350 --> 02:20:16,479
We shall find out
if he really is my nephew.

733
02:20:17,049 --> 02:20:21,239
You have my complete support,
Mr. Baudrexel.

734
02:20:40,739 --> 02:20:41,879
Uncle.

735
02:20:52,520 --> 02:20:54,010
Don't you recognize me?

736
02:20:58,959 --> 02:21:01,829
- You claim to be my nephew.
- It's me.

737
02:21:04,770 --> 02:21:06,319
Sit down.

738
02:21:08,540 --> 02:21:10,440
lf you're Clemens Forell...

739
02:21:11,770 --> 02:21:13,959
l'd like you to answer some questions.

740
02:22:01,760 --> 02:22:04,340
Mountain Troop Regiment Reichenhall.

741
02:22:04,829 --> 02:22:08,729
l gave my mother the photograph
for her birthday in '39.

742
02:22:09,399 --> 02:22:11,129
l wrote it on the back.

743
02:22:21,479 --> 02:22:24,290
To my dear mother on her birthday.

744
02:22:24,809 --> 02:22:28,620
15 July, 1939...

745
02:22:34,590 --> 02:22:35,700
Clemens.
