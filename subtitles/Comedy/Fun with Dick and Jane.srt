1
00:04:24,513 --> 00:04:26,413
- Morning, Mr. Harper.
- Morning, Jeff.

2
00:04:26,582 --> 00:04:28,482
- Hi, Ralph.
- Morning, sir.

3
00:04:37,025 --> 00:04:39,220
- Dick.
- Charlie.

4
00:04:39,395 --> 00:04:41,192
I've been waiting for you.

5
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,259
- How've you been?
- Sit down.

6
00:04:43,432 --> 00:04:46,230
- Pour yourself a drink.
- Thanks, Charlie.

7
00:04:50,672 --> 00:04:53,106
This business stinks, you know that?

8
00:04:53,275 --> 00:04:55,266
- Well...
- It stinks!

9
00:04:55,444 --> 00:05:00,882
It used to be the most exciting business
in the world. Now it stinks on ice.

10
00:05:01,049 --> 00:05:04,246
- It's been a rough year.
- It stinks.

11
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:09,623
- I guess it does stink.
- It stinks on ice!

12
00:05:09,792 --> 00:05:12,022
All right, on ice.

13
00:05:13,862 --> 00:05:19,164
It was a great feeling to be part of the
team that tied the lace on the shoe...

14
00:05:19,334 --> 00:05:22,394
...that took that giant step
for mankind.

15
00:05:24,406 --> 00:05:28,502
You don't get that feeling
from building a goddamn missile.

16
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:34,508
- Now, what's all this crap?
- My plan to reorganize my department.

17
00:05:34,683 --> 00:05:37,243
One small step.

18
00:05:37,586 --> 00:05:39,986
One giant step for mankind.

19
00:05:40,155 --> 00:05:42,419
I wouldn't say that,
but it's not a bad plan.

20
00:05:42,591 --> 00:05:45,424
You know who made that step possible?
We did.

21
00:05:45,594 --> 00:05:47,391
You and me.

22
00:05:47,563 --> 00:05:50,862
And Bob Kane, Frank Chapman.

23
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:57,966
We put Neil and what's his name
on the bloody moon.

24
00:05:58,307 --> 00:06:00,935
And then they gave us the shaft.

25
00:06:01,109 --> 00:06:02,269
It stinks.

26
00:06:03,212 --> 00:06:05,510
On ice.

27
00:06:06,281 --> 00:06:09,273
What do you say we talk turkey?

28
00:06:09,685 --> 00:06:11,118
Right, Charlie.

29
00:06:11,286 --> 00:06:14,221
I was thinking more in terms
of cutting costs than personnel.

30
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:16,482
Gobble, gobble, gobble.

31
00:06:18,427 --> 00:06:20,122
I was just talking turkey.

32
00:06:26,668 --> 00:06:28,363
Dick...

33
00:06:29,872 --> 00:06:33,364
...I always thought you were the kind
of guy I didn't have to bullshit.

34
00:06:33,542 --> 00:06:35,476
I'm glad to hear that.

35
00:06:35,644 --> 00:06:38,204
- Can I level with you?
- Sure.

36
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:43,210
- I mean, really level?
- Charlie, you can tell me anything.

37
00:06:43,719 --> 00:06:45,846
You're fired.

38
00:06:52,227 --> 00:06:56,561
I must have fired 50 people today,
but that's the first time I did it like that.

39
00:06:56,732 --> 00:06:59,462
The first time I ever said, just like,
"You're fired."

40
00:07:00,836 --> 00:07:03,202
Practice makes perfect.

41
00:07:05,941 --> 00:07:07,704
No.

42
00:07:08,877 --> 00:07:11,175
I shouldn't have done that.

43
00:07:11,747 --> 00:07:15,877
- It's just that I'm sick of all the bullshit.
- Wait a minute.

44
00:07:16,785 --> 00:07:19,948
- You're serious?
- Would I kid a pal?

45
00:07:20,455 --> 00:07:23,982
No jokes, Charlie.
You're really firing me?

46
00:07:25,127 --> 00:07:27,755
I don't have to tell you
what a lousy year we've had.

47
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,659
I haven't done a bad job.

48
00:07:29,831 --> 00:07:33,358
You've done a hell of a job.
And don't let anybody tell you different.

49
00:07:33,535 --> 00:07:35,435
Then why me?

50
00:07:36,071 --> 00:07:38,938
My division's outperformed everybody's.

51
00:07:39,107 --> 00:07:40,836
Seniority.

52
00:07:41,009 --> 00:07:43,000
I think that's what it was.

53
00:07:44,413 --> 00:07:48,782
I'm sure that's what it was.
Seniority. Yeah.

54
00:07:48,951 --> 00:07:52,318
Do you mean to tell me that
when you compare the productivity...?

55
00:07:52,487 --> 00:07:53,476
Dick!

56
00:07:54,089 --> 00:07:57,752
Do you mind if we don't go
into all that crap right now?

57
00:07:57,926 --> 00:08:00,622
Frankly, I'm a little bit looped.

58
00:08:01,196 --> 00:08:03,664
And I got blood on my hands.

59
00:08:04,433 --> 00:08:06,367
A lot of blood.

60
00:08:31,493 --> 00:08:32,585
Mr. Harper?

61
00:08:33,395 --> 00:08:34,885
I'll have to get back to you.

62
00:08:36,198 --> 00:08:39,929
I just want to say,
I'm very sorry you're leaving us.

63
00:08:41,603 --> 00:08:42,729
Well, thank you.

64
00:08:42,904 --> 00:08:45,600
Did Mr. Blanchard tell you
about the car?

65
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:49,143
- What car?
- The company car you've been using.

66
00:08:49,311 --> 00:08:51,939
You may retain the use of it
for two weeks.

67
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:53,376
Isn't that thoughtful?

68
00:08:53,715 --> 00:08:57,742
But we must have your company
credit cards now, please.

69
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,286
Goodbye, Mr. Harper.

70
00:09:23,345 --> 00:09:24,937
Jane!

71
00:09:29,751 --> 00:09:31,548
Hey, what is this?

72
00:09:31,753 --> 00:09:33,914
This is distressing.

73
00:09:43,699 --> 00:09:45,166
Jane.

74
00:09:48,136 --> 00:09:51,333
- Hey, Jane!
- Hey, sweetie, you're home early.

75
00:09:51,506 --> 00:09:52,768
I gotta talk to you.

76
00:09:52,941 --> 00:09:55,501
I gotta talk to you, Mr. Harper.

77
00:09:55,744 --> 00:09:58,645
The second payment's
due on the pool.

78
00:10:02,851 --> 00:10:06,218
Billy, will you get your friend
out of the cement!

79
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:09,614
- I've been fired.
- Huh?

80
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,952
I've been fired.

81
00:10:27,976 --> 00:10:29,341
Oh, baby.

82
00:10:29,511 --> 00:10:31,945
What did you say?

83
00:10:32,414 --> 00:10:34,644
He said he's tired.

84
00:10:36,084 --> 00:10:40,020
Hey, Mr. Harper,
you were canned today.

85
00:10:41,556 --> 00:10:43,990
What sign are you?

86
00:10:45,327 --> 00:10:47,090
He's an Aquarius.

87
00:10:47,462 --> 00:10:50,022
You poor bastard. I knew it.

88
00:10:50,565 --> 00:10:51,896
What a bummer.

89
00:10:52,601 --> 00:10:57,402
Mars is in direct conjunction
with Saturn.

90
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,634
It's a tough time for us Aquarians.

91
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:05,576
You know that bill I gave you,
for the pool, the second payment?

92
00:11:05,747 --> 00:11:08,614
I'll give you until next Wednesday.

93
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,960
Esperanza.

94
00:11:28,203 --> 00:11:29,465
<i>La cena</i> is ready.

95
00:11:29,638 --> 00:11:31,367
- Thank you.
- <i>Gracias.</i>

96
00:11:33,341 --> 00:11:35,809
I can't believe that Charlie fired you.

97
00:11:35,977 --> 00:11:39,708
- Charlie fired me.
- Dirty rat.

98
00:11:39,881 --> 00:11:42,782
After all the years of bottom-pinching
I took from him.

99
00:11:43,084 --> 00:11:47,020
Does that mean we're gonna
be poor, like the Waltons?

100
00:11:47,422 --> 00:11:49,549
No, Billy, it doesn't.

101
00:11:50,392 --> 00:11:52,758
What are we gonna do about the pool?

102
00:11:54,496 --> 00:11:56,555
We'll get it finished first.

103
00:11:58,366 --> 00:11:59,697
We won't heat it.

104
00:12:00,702 --> 00:12:02,260
Not until you get another job.

105
00:12:02,437 --> 00:12:04,598
How will we swim in the pool
if it's cold?

106
00:12:04,773 --> 00:12:07,241
Billy is right.
What will the neighbors say...

107
00:12:07,409 --> 00:12:10,469
...if they don't see steam
coming off our pool on a chilly night?

108
00:12:10,645 --> 00:12:12,579
I'm making some economies
around here.

109
00:12:12,747 --> 00:12:15,944
- Billy, we'll give up our ski lessons.
- God!

110
00:12:16,251 --> 00:12:19,482
- No more French wines at home, sir.
- Oh, God!

111
00:12:20,622 --> 00:12:23,113
And I will drop
the Book of the Month Club.

112
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:24,781
What about my drum set?

113
00:12:25,293 --> 00:12:27,386
Family, everything's gonna be all right.

114
00:12:27,562 --> 00:12:30,588
There's absolutely nothing
to worry about.

115
00:12:33,969 --> 00:12:35,459
Take that stuff up there.

116
00:12:35,637 --> 00:12:37,605
You, in the truck,
watch those plants!

117
00:12:37,772 --> 00:12:40,172
That stuff goes too.
Take it easy over there.

118
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,832
Watch those roots on that thing.

119
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:45,571
Hey, those plants go up next too, okay?

120
00:12:47,082 --> 00:12:49,573
- Stop it!
- Hello, Mrs. Harper.

121
00:12:49,951 --> 00:12:50,975
That goes next.

122
00:12:51,152 --> 00:12:53,586
What in God's name
do you think you're doing?

123
00:12:53,755 --> 00:12:55,620
You got our notice, Mrs. Harper?

124
00:12:55,790 --> 00:13:00,318
- Yes. I sent you a check.
- Bouncy, bouncy. That's naughty.

125
00:13:00,495 --> 00:13:02,793
Hey, watch those plants!
Watch that stuff.

126
00:13:02,964 --> 00:13:05,660
- Get it up over there.
- I'll give you another check.

127
00:13:05,834 --> 00:13:08,462
Two checks bounced already,
Mrs. Harper.

128
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:12,697
Your mother carried you for nine months,
but we'll only carry you for two.

129
00:13:13,308 --> 00:13:14,297
Clear that bank off.

130
00:13:14,476 --> 00:13:18,435
Just because the bank made a mistake
is no reason to come and dig up my tree!

131
00:13:18,613 --> 00:13:20,513
- Excuse me.
- Not yours. Ours.

132
00:13:20,682 --> 00:13:22,877
We put this stuff in,
now we'll tear it out.

133
00:13:23,051 --> 00:13:24,040
Watch it.

134
00:13:24,219 --> 00:13:27,279
If you don't wanna lose your shirt,
don't put it on the cuff.

135
00:13:27,455 --> 00:13:29,013
You're using Gestapo tactics.

136
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:31,681
That's impossible. I'm Jewish.

137
00:13:33,495 --> 00:13:36,953
Hey, watch those plants over there.
Come on, watch them roots.

138
00:13:37,132 --> 00:13:40,158
Right. Take all of these bushes out,
all of these trees...

139
00:13:40,335 --> 00:13:44,362
...everything up there, every
rotten weed in this whole garden.

140
00:13:44,539 --> 00:13:48,771
Come here. Would you please remove
this tracheotomy or whatever it's called.

141
00:13:48,944 --> 00:13:52,243
This is not what we ordered,
and I told you so a month ago.

142
00:13:52,847 --> 00:13:56,715
Can you believe this? I told them,
plant what we want or take it all back.

143
00:13:56,885 --> 00:13:58,352
What a rip-off.

144
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,817
Right. Roll up the lawn.

145
00:13:59,988 --> 00:14:04,425
I don't like the lawn either.
AstroTurf has more life than this stuff.

146
00:14:04,893 --> 00:14:08,056
You will never work
in this neighborhood again!

147
00:14:14,235 --> 00:14:18,467
- Hey, Mom, you were terrific.
- You think so, kid?

148
00:14:19,941 --> 00:14:22,535
- What do you want?
- I want the plants inside.

149
00:14:22,711 --> 00:14:25,009
Step one foot in this house,
I'll call the police.

150
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,171
I still want the plants.

151
00:14:32,954 --> 00:14:34,581
Pretty grim, huh?

152
00:14:34,756 --> 00:14:37,281
What are we going to tell Dad
when he comes home?

153
00:14:59,981 --> 00:15:01,346
Well...

154
00:15:02,183 --> 00:15:04,481
...are you gonna tell me
how bad things are...

155
00:15:04,652 --> 00:15:07,086
...or are you gonna wait
for the roof to fall in?

156
00:15:07,255 --> 00:15:09,450
It really isn't as bad as it looks.

157
00:15:09,624 --> 00:15:12,024
Nothing is as bad as this looks.

158
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:14,724
We don't have any income
or any assets.

159
00:15:14,896 --> 00:15:16,921
What do you mean,
we don't have any assets?

160
00:15:17,098 --> 00:15:19,123
Other than the sun in the morning
and the moon at night.

161
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,029
We got this house.

162
00:15:21,202 --> 00:15:23,261
We owe $ 77,000 on this house, Dick.

163
00:15:23,438 --> 00:15:25,497
If you died right now,
how would I pay it off?

164
00:15:25,673 --> 00:15:26,833
Out of the insurance.

165
00:15:27,008 --> 00:15:29,306
We don't have any.
You borrowed against it.

166
00:15:29,477 --> 00:15:31,672
Right, right, right. I forgot.

167
00:15:31,846 --> 00:15:34,144
This is ridiculous.
I'm not gonna die tonight.

168
00:15:34,315 --> 00:15:35,680
The night is young.

169
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:38,250
It's comforting to know
when things get tough...

170
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,752
...l'll have you standing behind me
with an ice pick.

171
00:15:40,922 --> 00:15:43,686
You've been leading a secret life
for these last years.

172
00:15:43,858 --> 00:15:47,692
For example, what are
"insecured municipal debentures"?

173
00:15:47,862 --> 00:15:51,298
I don't know. I gambled on a few things
for us, and I lost. I'm sorry.

174
00:15:51,466 --> 00:15:53,331
You gambled. You lost.
What about me?

175
00:15:53,501 --> 00:15:56,664
I gambled and lost, and I didn't
even get a chance to play.

176
00:15:56,838 --> 00:15:58,635
I didn't even watch.

177
00:15:58,807 --> 00:16:01,833
Your interest in economics
was limited to the spending part.

178
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:04,945
I always thought of you as
a responsible aerospace executive.

179
00:16:05,113 --> 00:16:08,276
Who would have known you were
the Typhoid Mary of high finance.

180
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:11,647
If I'd have consulted you,
I wouldn't have lost my job.

181
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,913
If you think you can do better,
take over.

182
00:16:14,089 --> 00:16:15,852
It would be hard
to do it any worse.

183
00:16:16,024 --> 00:16:18,959
Go ahead, be my guest.
It's all yours.

184
00:16:19,127 --> 00:16:20,890
My very thought.

185
00:16:21,062 --> 00:16:24,190
And my first act as director
of family economics...

186
00:16:24,365 --> 00:16:26,833
...is to put you on an allowance.
- On a what?

187
00:16:27,001 --> 00:16:30,960
What kind of lunatic spends $ 1000 on
lunch when he's out of a job and in debt?

188
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:34,108
The kind that knows you can't
get a job if you look like a loser.

189
00:16:34,275 --> 00:16:37,733
If I was Diners Club, I'd bronze your
stomach and put it in the hall of fame.

190
00:16:37,912 --> 00:16:38,901
Point number two.

191
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,675
Your job is to get on the food stamp
program, look for work in your field...

192
00:16:42,851 --> 00:16:47,652
Excuse me, why don't I get a "job" job?
Like a busboy or a waiter?

193
00:16:47,822 --> 00:16:49,847
If we're not too proud
to go on welfare...

194
00:16:50,024 --> 00:16:52,254
- We can't afford it.
- Can't afford it?

195
00:16:52,427 --> 00:16:56,420
You earn more money on unemployment
than you could in any of those jobs.

196
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:59,226
My job is to get a "job" job.

197
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,858
- You're gonna get a job?
- Yes. Incredible as it may seem.

198
00:17:04,305 --> 00:17:08,173
May I ask... No offense, mind you.
What do you think you're qualified to do?

199
00:17:08,343 --> 00:17:10,504
Secretary of the treasury
seems to be filled.

200
00:17:10,678 --> 00:17:14,205
- There must be lots of things I can do.
- You never worked a day in your life.

201
00:17:14,382 --> 00:17:16,850
You can't type,
and you can't take shorthand.

202
00:17:17,252 --> 00:17:19,311
I'm a college graduate.

203
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:21,953
Reasonably intelligent.
Not altogether unattractive.

204
00:17:22,123 --> 00:17:24,421
Yes, but will you be happy
being a hooker?

205
00:17:26,728 --> 00:17:30,425
The only jobs you consider me
qualified for are secretary and hooker.

206
00:17:30,732 --> 00:17:33,963
You're not qualified to be a secretary.

207
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,005
What an interview.

208
00:17:41,276 --> 00:17:44,712
Don't take it too hard, honey.
It's only the first time.

209
00:17:44,879 --> 00:17:48,337
Take it too hard?
I start on Monday.

210
00:17:48,516 --> 00:17:50,279
That's wonderful.

211
00:18:23,618 --> 00:18:27,076
- The line ends after me, mister.
- Sorry.

212
00:18:31,793 --> 00:18:34,125
- That's a pretty nice suit, mister.
- Thank you.

213
00:18:34,295 --> 00:18:36,889
You've got some nerve
coming here dressed like that.

214
00:18:37,065 --> 00:18:40,865
People in here need this money.
This ain't no damn joy ride.

215
00:18:43,004 --> 00:18:46,667
Hey, you're Mr. Harper, aren't you?
Taft Aerospace.

216
00:18:46,841 --> 00:18:48,672
I'm Raoul Esteban. Remember?

217
00:18:48,843 --> 00:18:51,539
I was in the Taft Maintenance Division.
I used to do your office.

218
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:54,375
- Sure, Raoul. Nice to see you.
- How you doing, man?

219
00:18:54,549 --> 00:18:56,813
Hey, they canned you too, huh?

220
00:18:56,985 --> 00:18:58,953
It's more complicated than that.

221
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,917
- First time in here?
- Damn right.

222
00:19:01,089 --> 00:19:04,252
Man, are you in luck.
I'm gonna take care of you.

223
00:19:04,425 --> 00:19:07,053
- <i>Mi casa, su casa.</i> You know?
- Sure.

224
00:19:07,228 --> 00:19:09,253
First thing, you're in the wrong line.

225
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:11,591
- Wrong line.
- I'm gonna lose my place here.

226
00:19:11,766 --> 00:19:13,961
Information, they make you wait
in line two hours.

227
00:19:14,135 --> 00:19:16,695
All they do is tell you
to fill out one of these.

228
00:19:16,871 --> 00:19:19,066
I'm gonna take care of you,
no problem.

229
00:19:23,645 --> 00:19:26,113
I'm going to have an operation
in a month.

230
00:19:26,281 --> 00:19:28,306
You know, the operation.

231
00:19:28,483 --> 00:19:32,078
And my analyst said I should
start making the adjustment.

232
00:19:32,253 --> 00:19:34,881
And, well, that's why they fired me.

233
00:19:35,056 --> 00:19:39,584
For wearing a most demure gray maxi
with a matching cashmere twin set.

234
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:43,197
- It's here in the letter from my analyst.
- Let me check this out.

235
00:19:43,364 --> 00:19:45,696
Maybe we should pick another line,
what do you say?

236
00:19:45,867 --> 00:19:48,700
Listen, man, it's no sweat.
They ain't gonna hassle you.

237
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:51,395
Look what your card says.
Aerospace executive.

238
00:19:51,572 --> 00:19:53,540
Yeah, but I'm not that anymore.

239
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:56,233
In here, man, you are what you were.

240
00:19:56,411 --> 00:19:59,209
You're gonna get 104 bucks a week.
All I get is 50.

241
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,745
You're top guy around here.

242
00:20:00,915 --> 00:20:03,941
They ain't gonna mess
with a guy like you. No problem.

243
00:20:04,886 --> 00:20:08,219
Why do I have to see the supervisor?
It's all so simple.

244
00:20:08,389 --> 00:20:09,788
I'm sorry.

245
00:20:10,224 --> 00:20:13,455
All right. Shoot.

246
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:22,534
I've seen some fruits in my day,
but he really takes the cake, huh?

247
00:20:22,704 --> 00:20:24,399
Not really.

248
00:20:24,572 --> 00:20:28,235
Come on. That's the flamingest
faggot I've ever seen.

249
00:20:28,676 --> 00:20:31,406
In the first place, he's a transsexual.

250
00:20:31,579 --> 00:20:34,047
Not a fruit, not a fag,
not even a homosexual.

251
00:20:34,215 --> 00:20:38,914
He has the mind, soul and desires
of a woman imprisoned in a man's body.

252
00:20:40,488 --> 00:20:43,457
Now, what can I do for you, sir?

253
00:20:48,696 --> 00:20:50,721
- Thank you.
- Oh, God.

254
00:20:52,433 --> 00:20:53,866
Good night.

255
00:20:54,435 --> 00:20:56,300
Do you resent it that I got a job?

256
00:20:56,471 --> 00:20:58,564
Don't be silly.

257
00:21:01,342 --> 00:21:02,934
You shouldn't feel threatened...

258
00:21:03,111 --> 00:21:06,842
Look, I don't resent you getting a job.
I'm thrilled you got a job.

259
00:21:07,014 --> 00:21:08,743
I can tell by your shouting.

260
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:12,044
I'm shouting because I've got
an interview at 9 in the morning...

261
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,246
...about food stamps,
and I'd like to get some sleep.

262
00:21:15,423 --> 00:21:19,655
Or maybe, now that you've conquered
the business world, we don't need them.

263
00:21:19,827 --> 00:21:22,091
I thought you were going today
to get food stamps.

264
00:21:22,263 --> 00:21:25,061
Jane, you just don't get food stamps.

265
00:21:25,233 --> 00:21:28,600
You don't come in off the street
and say, "I'd like food stamps"...

266
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:30,101
...and they give you some.

267
00:21:30,271 --> 00:21:33,798
It happens to be a very difficult
and complicated process.

268
00:21:33,975 --> 00:21:36,842
- I'm sure you can handle it, sweetie.
- I don't know.

269
00:21:37,011 --> 00:21:40,447
You getting this job
may have screwed up our eligibility.

270
00:21:44,719 --> 00:21:47,347
Spot, will you shut up.

271
00:21:50,024 --> 00:21:55,155
It's all politics, man. You don't
have to worry about it. Come on.

272
00:22:07,675 --> 00:22:09,006
Yeah. So?

273
00:22:09,177 --> 00:22:10,542
A guy comes to your house...

274
00:22:10,711 --> 00:22:13,373
Wait a second.
A guy comes to my house?

275
00:22:13,548 --> 00:22:15,106
He wants to see
where you got to cook...

276
00:22:15,283 --> 00:22:18,582
...and if you're telling the truth about
how many people you got living there.

277
00:22:18,753 --> 00:22:20,516
All right.
A guy comes to my house.

278
00:22:20,688 --> 00:22:23,156
First, you fill out the forms.
Tell him about the forms.

279
00:22:23,324 --> 00:22:24,450
What about the forms?

280
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:28,186
Then, you get to buy vouchers,
which you take to a place that sells...

281
00:22:30,164 --> 00:22:31,426
Are they putting me on?

282
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:34,193
Hey, you wanna know
how to get food stamps, right?

283
00:22:34,368 --> 00:22:35,665
We're trying to explain.

284
00:22:35,837 --> 00:22:39,273
What do you think,
it's dinner for two at Trader Vic's?

285
00:22:39,807 --> 00:22:43,402
All right. So after the visits
and after the forms, how much do I get?

286
00:22:43,578 --> 00:22:46,445
Excuse me. I'm going to explain.

287
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,280
Now, you gonna put down
you got just one wife and one kid?

288
00:22:55,456 --> 00:22:58,016
Yeah. Any of you guys
got more than one wife?

289
00:22:58,192 --> 00:23:00,126
Give him the one wife and kid.

290
00:23:00,728 --> 00:23:03,526
One wife and one kid.

291
00:23:03,698 --> 00:23:06,428
And you're getting
your unemployment now, right?

292
00:23:06,801 --> 00:23:09,133
- How much do I get?
- You get 108 bucks worth a month.

293
00:23:09,303 --> 00:23:11,100
<i>Imigración!</i>

294
00:23:11,906 --> 00:23:13,100
Come on! Let's go!

295
00:23:16,143 --> 00:23:17,371
Something I said?

296
00:23:17,545 --> 00:23:20,776
No, just immigration police
coming in to check things out.

297
00:23:24,719 --> 00:23:28,314
Hey, Francisco,
<i>dos cervezas, por favor.</i>

298
00:23:30,057 --> 00:23:32,992
Okay, Poncho,
let's see your immigration card.

299
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,752
Don't play games. Your card.

300
00:23:34,929 --> 00:23:38,194
Hey, he's an aerospace executive.
He sends people to the moon.

301
00:23:38,366 --> 00:23:42,132
Yeah, and I'm Flash Gordon.
<i>Tarjeta de imigración.</i>

302
00:23:42,303 --> 00:23:44,863
<i>Tarjeta de imigración</i>?
What are you, crazy?

303
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,405
- You got those beers?
- Buddy, you're going downtown.

304
00:23:47,575 --> 00:23:49,634
I'm not your buddy,
and I don't speak Spanish.

305
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:53,109
- That's what they all say.
- Because I said <i>cerveza</i> and <i>por favor</i>?

306
00:23:53,281 --> 00:23:56,876
Everybody says <i>por favor.</i>
How about "<i>vaya con Dios</i>"?

307
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,720
Paula, I don't have the same shoes.

308
00:24:01,889 --> 00:24:04,790
Honey, they're always
sending mismatches.

309
00:24:04,959 --> 00:24:08,520
- Where are the falsies?
- In the box over there on the chair.

310
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:12,297
Just stick this in your heel.
That ought to do it.

311
00:24:12,466 --> 00:24:17,335
And don't worry. After all, modeling
is nothing more but organized walking.

312
00:24:17,505 --> 00:24:20,633
Hey, you're on. Come on.

313
00:24:48,536 --> 00:24:50,299
I'm terribly sorry.

314
00:24:51,606 --> 00:24:53,130
How much is this, please?

315
00:24:53,307 --> 00:24:56,765
- $ 185.
- 185.

316
00:24:57,712 --> 00:24:59,543
Miss. Miss.

317
00:24:59,714 --> 00:25:01,841
How much is this dress?

318
00:25:02,049 --> 00:25:05,143
It's a nightgown. I don't know
anyway, though. I'm sorry.

319
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:07,344
You don't know? What a klutz.

320
00:25:21,268 --> 00:25:22,565
Who is she?

321
00:25:22,737 --> 00:25:25,763
Some friend
of the fashion coordinator's.

322
00:26:06,547 --> 00:26:08,208
Hello, Jane.

323
00:26:08,616 --> 00:26:10,777
Oh, my God, Dick!
What have you done?

324
00:26:10,951 --> 00:26:13,146
A guy named Jim Weeks
is coming to lunch.

325
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,948
He wants to talk to me about a job.

326
00:26:16,123 --> 00:26:18,956
- Where did you get the money?
- I've got friends.

327
00:26:19,126 --> 00:26:21,219
We'll tell him you're on a diet.

328
00:26:21,562 --> 00:26:23,496
Why don't we tell him
you're on a diet?

329
00:26:23,664 --> 00:26:26,827
This is not fun, Jane.
This is serious.

330
00:26:27,601 --> 00:26:29,694
Do you really think
he'll offer you a job?

331
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:33,328
As long as he thinks I don't need one.
I know those bastards.

332
00:26:36,277 --> 00:26:39,178
That's funny. That's funny.

333
00:26:39,346 --> 00:26:41,041
What are you gonna do?

334
00:26:41,382 --> 00:26:44,283
- Okay, what is it?
- An Eskimo peeing.

335
00:26:44,452 --> 00:26:46,647
An Eskimo peeing.

336
00:26:48,289 --> 00:26:50,257
Jane, it's absolutely lovely.

337
00:26:50,424 --> 00:26:53,689
I just wish you could have
joined us, that's all.

338
00:26:54,729 --> 00:26:56,822
Is that funny.

339
00:26:56,997 --> 00:26:59,397
Could we have some coffee
in the living room?

340
00:26:59,567 --> 00:27:01,296
Certainly.

341
00:27:01,969 --> 00:27:05,962
- Shall we repair, Jim?
- I think that's a hell of an idea.

342
00:27:07,475 --> 00:27:09,909
- That's very funny.
- Make yourself comfortable.

343
00:27:10,077 --> 00:27:11,942
Thank you.
I love your house.

344
00:27:12,113 --> 00:27:14,843
It's solid. It's a real home.
Not too much.

345
00:27:15,015 --> 00:27:16,346
Thank you, Jim.

346
00:27:16,517 --> 00:27:18,144
- We like it.
- Thank you.

347
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:21,311
It does tend to grow
a little confining. You know?

348
00:27:21,489 --> 00:27:23,013
Oh, I do. I do. I do.

349
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:27,925
Look, Dick, I'm not going
to beat around the bush with you.

350
00:27:28,095 --> 00:27:29,687
We like you.

351
00:27:29,897 --> 00:27:32,365
- We like your style.
- Thank you, Jim.

352
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,594
- We like your mind.
- Thank you.

353
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:39,035
But we can't pay you the money
you've been getting at Taft.

354
00:27:40,641 --> 00:27:42,370
Not in straight salary, that is.

355
00:27:44,678 --> 00:27:46,771
Thirty thou.

356
00:27:47,181 --> 00:27:48,944
That's our top.

357
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,047
Thirty, eh?

358
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:56,314
Gee, I don't know, Jim.

359
00:27:56,690 --> 00:28:00,251
Well, if you play ball with us,
the sky is the limit.

360
00:28:00,427 --> 00:28:02,657
It's attractive, Jim.
It's damn attractive.

361
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:06,288
I got several irons in the fire now,
and I'd like to think about it.

362
00:28:06,467 --> 00:28:08,731
- I can think about it?
- Sure. Think about it.

363
00:28:08,903 --> 00:28:11,531
I'm not trying to rush you.
I wouldn't dream of it.

364
00:28:11,705 --> 00:28:13,696
I'd like to consider
the complete picture.

365
00:28:13,874 --> 00:28:19,835
Sure, consider the complete picture,
but printed circuits, not rocket ships.

366
00:28:20,014 --> 00:28:24,917
Collecting and storing information right
here on mother earth. That's the future.

367
00:28:25,085 --> 00:28:27,849
And any man with a thought...

368
00:28:28,022 --> 00:28:30,388
...about industry in 10 years' time...

369
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:34,995
Any man thinking about tomorrow
will say goodbye to aerospace today.

370
00:28:36,964 --> 00:28:39,432
- What are you doing?
- I'm closing the shutters.

371
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,932
Why don't you take Mr. Weeks
to see the backyard.

372
00:28:42,102 --> 00:28:44,468
- Backyard?
- <i>Open up the door, Mrs. Harper...</i>

373
00:28:44,705 --> 00:28:48,869
<i>... or we're gonna huff and puff and</i>
<i>we're gonna blow your house down.</i>

374
00:28:50,544 --> 00:28:52,637
<i>We want the indoor plants, deadbeat.</i>

375
00:28:52,847 --> 00:28:56,613
<i>Plants ain't free just because</i>
<i>they grow on trees, deadbeat.</i>

376
00:28:56,784 --> 00:29:00,276
- <i>I know you're in there, deadbeat.</i>
- Excuse me, Jim.

377
00:29:01,622 --> 00:29:04,591
<i>You can't buy a rubber plant</i>
<i>with a rubber check, Harper.</i>

378
00:29:05,092 --> 00:29:07,117
<i>I know you're in there, deadbeat.</i>

379
00:29:07,294 --> 00:29:10,286
- What the hell's going on here?
- We've come for our plants.

380
00:29:10,464 --> 00:29:12,659
I'm having a meeting.
You can't come in now.

381
00:29:12,833 --> 00:29:15,631
I can't? Okay, Tippy.

382
00:29:15,803 --> 00:29:17,134
Excuse me.

383
00:29:20,241 --> 00:29:22,937
"Jane," she asked,
"would you care for a cognac?"

384
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:26,045
"Yes, thank you very much.
I'd like one desperately."

385
00:29:27,581 --> 00:29:29,344
Watch it, lady.

386
00:29:35,055 --> 00:29:38,286
Hey, lgo, could you do something
about that tree?

387
00:29:38,459 --> 00:29:39,824
Yes, sir.

388
00:29:49,103 --> 00:29:50,900
Afternoon, Harper.

389
00:29:51,505 --> 00:29:53,336
Hello, Nesbitt.

390
00:29:54,174 --> 00:29:59,578
The wind's been kicking up your yard
and blowing it into our windows.

391
00:29:59,914 --> 00:30:02,007
I'm going to seed it.

392
00:30:05,252 --> 00:30:07,345
You're having a garage sale?

393
00:30:08,255 --> 00:30:09,916
Yeah. Odds and ends.

394
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:13,287
Déclassé, Harper.
<i>Très</i> déclassé.

395
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:16,987
It brings all the riffraff in the
neighborhood. You know what I mean.

396
00:30:22,069 --> 00:30:25,664
Hey, man, the opera's
coming to town next Tuesday.

397
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:26,828
So what?

398
00:30:27,007 --> 00:30:29,703
So 40 bucks a night, man. Cash.

399
00:30:29,877 --> 00:30:30,866
Can you sing?

400
00:30:31,045 --> 00:30:33,912
Hell, no! All you do is stand around
while they sing.

401
00:30:34,081 --> 00:30:36,777
Sometimes, you carry a spear,
or hold the elephant.

402
00:30:36,951 --> 00:30:38,350
It's real easy, man.

403
00:30:39,653 --> 00:30:42,986
Excuse me, Nesbitt.
Private matter to discuss.

404
00:30:45,626 --> 00:30:48,754
- What about unemployment?
- We don't tell them, man.

405
00:30:48,929 --> 00:30:51,727
- Suppose they find out?
- How are they gonna find out?

406
00:30:51,899 --> 00:30:55,460
They pay us in cash. There's no papers.
No way they're gonna find out.

407
00:30:55,636 --> 00:30:58,264
You mean I'm gonna be
a welfare chiseler?

408
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:02,375
Hey, hey! A welfare chiseler is just
some bum who doesn't wanna work.

409
00:31:02,543 --> 00:31:03,532
We wanna work.

410
00:31:03,711 --> 00:31:07,078
Yeah, but the rules say you can't
work and collect unemployment.

411
00:31:07,247 --> 00:31:11,047
You can't always go by the rules.
There are times to run heavy numbers.

412
00:31:11,218 --> 00:31:13,880
"When in the course of human events..."
You know?

413
00:31:14,355 --> 00:31:16,323
How about guys
like Rockefeller and Dupont?

414
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:19,152
Think they let a few crummy rules
stand in the way?

415
00:31:19,326 --> 00:31:22,625
That's the whole enchilada
that made this country great, man.

416
00:31:23,497 --> 00:31:26,489
- I never thought of it like that.
- You'd better start.

417
00:31:26,667 --> 00:31:30,068
I ain't no deadbeat welfare chiseler,
and neither are you.

418
00:31:30,237 --> 00:31:32,831
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay, man.

419
00:31:59,833 --> 00:32:02,301
Cool it. Cool it. Cool it.

420
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:31,757
Cool it. That's enough.
Wait a minute.

421
00:33:02,663 --> 00:33:04,858
So you didn't work last week,
Mr. Harper?

422
00:33:05,032 --> 00:33:07,296
- That's right.
- That's funny.

423
00:33:07,468 --> 00:33:11,097
I caught your gypsy act
the other night. Divine.

424
00:33:11,271 --> 00:33:13,535
Too bad I won't see you
for three years.

425
00:33:14,942 --> 00:33:17,775
No unemployment for three years.
I can't believe it.

426
00:33:17,945 --> 00:33:20,812
Look on the positive side.
They could have sent you to jail.

427
00:33:20,981 --> 00:33:24,178
Unemployment's the only thing we had.
What am I gonna tell Jane?

428
00:33:24,351 --> 00:33:26,012
I wouldn't tell her.

429
00:33:32,526 --> 00:33:35,086
- Hello, dear.
- Hi, Mom, how are you?

430
00:33:35,262 --> 00:33:38,993
We're just fine, dear.
It's so nice to see you.

431
00:33:39,166 --> 00:33:43,626
How thoughtful of you.
Well, your father's waiting to see you.

432
00:33:45,572 --> 00:33:48,006
- Hi, Dad.
- Jane brought us some flowers, dear.

433
00:33:48,175 --> 00:33:50,006
Hello, Jane.

434
00:33:54,882 --> 00:33:58,079
- Would you like a cup of tea, dear?
- No, thanks, Mom.

435
00:33:59,419 --> 00:34:01,046
Over here.

436
00:34:05,726 --> 00:34:10,891
I discussed your phone call with your
mother yesterday, after I hung up.

437
00:34:11,064 --> 00:34:13,362
"What does she want to see us about?"

438
00:34:13,534 --> 00:34:15,525
- Didn't I say that, Mother?
- Yes.

439
00:34:15,702 --> 00:34:18,330
Something you couldn't discuss
over the phone, you said.

440
00:34:18,505 --> 00:34:21,133
- Yes. That's right, Dad. l...
- Well...

441
00:34:21,875 --> 00:34:25,504
...I narrowed it down
to three possibilities:

442
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:29,809
Health, emotion or money.

443
00:34:30,517 --> 00:34:33,918
Let's take health.
Is there someone ill?

444
00:34:34,721 --> 00:34:38,316
No, I ruled that out myself.
I distinctly remember asking...

445
00:34:38,492 --> 00:34:41,393
...about everyone's health,
and your answer was positive.

446
00:34:41,562 --> 00:34:43,462
Without hesitation.

447
00:34:44,064 --> 00:34:46,294
Which brings us to...

448
00:34:46,633 --> 00:34:48,123
...emotion.

449
00:34:48,769 --> 00:34:52,227
At your age, a euphemism for divorce.

450
00:34:53,273 --> 00:34:56,640
Well, you never came to see us
to talk about marrying him...

451
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:59,779
...so why should you come
to talk about divorcing him?

452
00:34:59,947 --> 00:35:03,974
No, a divorce can be handled
in a phone call.

453
00:35:04,151 --> 00:35:05,675
So...

454
00:35:05,953 --> 00:35:07,682
...it's money.

455
00:35:07,988 --> 00:35:10,786
You're broke. That's it, isn't it?

456
00:35:10,958 --> 00:35:13,324
Who ever said Sherlock Holmes
was dead, eh, Mom?

457
00:35:13,493 --> 00:35:16,656
I was right, Mother, they're broke.

458
00:35:17,998 --> 00:35:20,592
Dick hasn't had a job in
over three months, Dad.

459
00:35:20,767 --> 00:35:22,792
Why didn't you tell us before, dear?

460
00:35:23,237 --> 00:35:26,331
We were sure he could get a job
and didn't want to worry you.

461
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:31,443
I unloaded my aerospace stock the day
they landed on the moon. I knew...

462
00:35:31,612 --> 00:35:33,910
...that was the peak.
I was right.

463
00:35:34,081 --> 00:35:35,742
It's a depressed industry.

464
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:37,842
Depressed and depressing.

465
00:35:38,552 --> 00:35:42,784
- I was right about the stocks.
- You certainly were.

466
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:44,579
Jane...

467
00:35:45,926 --> 00:35:47,518
...l'll make it easier for you.

468
00:35:47,894 --> 00:35:50,419
You've come here to borrow
money, haven't you?

469
00:35:51,565 --> 00:35:53,362
Yes, Dad.

470
00:35:53,934 --> 00:35:57,131
Well, I'd love to help you.
I really would.

471
00:35:57,804 --> 00:36:02,707
But I can't. I'm just opposed to
borrowing or lending on principle.

472
00:36:03,477 --> 00:36:06,378
Self-reliance. It's like a...

473
00:36:07,314 --> 00:36:09,748
...religious thing to me.

474
00:36:10,651 --> 00:36:12,380
Ralph Waldo Emerson.

475
00:36:12,786 --> 00:36:15,220
He's like my God.

476
00:36:15,922 --> 00:36:21,087
- "Need breaks iron." That's what he said.
- Well, it certainly broke us, Dad.

477
00:36:21,561 --> 00:36:25,224
I told Mother that both of you have
been living far beyond your means.

478
00:36:25,399 --> 00:36:28,493
Nothing, just nothing at all
set aside for a rainy day.

479
00:36:29,436 --> 00:36:30,903
All right.

480
00:36:31,605 --> 00:36:33,368
It's the monsoon season...

481
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:37,335
...and you're standing
outside in torn raincoats.

482
00:36:38,812 --> 00:36:40,541
Come through this by yourselves...

483
00:36:40,714 --> 00:36:43,182
...and you'll be dry
for the rest of your lives.

484
00:36:43,517 --> 00:36:45,849
Take money from me and you'll be wet.

485
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:49,446
Soaking wet from now on. Jane...

486
00:36:49,723 --> 00:36:51,623
...it's the best thing
that could happen.

487
00:36:52,025 --> 00:36:53,686
Especially for Dick.

488
00:36:54,461 --> 00:36:58,557
I'm so happy for both of
you. Especially for Dick.

489
00:36:58,832 --> 00:37:00,060
What about Billy?

490
00:37:00,534 --> 00:37:05,301
When I was his age, Mr. Nostic
gave me my first paper route.

491
00:37:06,473 --> 00:37:08,737
I've heard that story already.

492
00:37:09,443 --> 00:37:11,809
Dad, Billy is doing homework
by candlelight.

493
00:37:11,978 --> 00:37:15,175
Splendid. So did Abraham Lincoln.

494
00:37:22,189 --> 00:37:24,487
How are you both doing?

495
00:37:25,692 --> 00:37:27,717
Never better. Jane...

496
00:37:28,362 --> 00:37:31,695
...we have sowed all of our
lives, and we're now...

497
00:37:32,366 --> 00:37:35,130
...reaping the harvest. Reap!

498
00:37:35,669 --> 00:37:38,297
Reap! Reap!

499
00:37:38,472 --> 00:37:41,441
I seem to feel a monsoon dripping in.

500
00:37:42,609 --> 00:37:45,077
It was nice to see you again, Dad.

501
00:37:47,581 --> 00:37:50,607
- Bye, Mom.
- Goodbye, dear.

502
00:37:51,084 --> 00:37:54,178
You tell Dick that he's a lucky man.

503
00:37:54,955 --> 00:37:58,254
Not everybody gets
a real chance to be tested.

504
00:37:58,759 --> 00:38:01,023
You tell him that I'm jealous.

505
00:38:01,628 --> 00:38:06,964
- I'm sure he'll be really thrilled, Dad.
- Don't forget to tell him I'm jealous too.

506
00:38:10,637 --> 00:38:12,195
So long.

507
00:38:15,308 --> 00:38:17,037
Bye-bye.

508
00:38:42,102 --> 00:38:45,697
- Mister, you got problems.
- Why do you think we're here?

509
00:38:45,872 --> 00:38:49,808
I know why you're here.
You got guts. I'll give you that.

510
00:38:50,043 --> 00:38:52,568
Your ad says, "If you've been
turned down elsewhere..."

511
00:38:52,746 --> 00:38:54,213
It didn't say "everywhere."

512
00:38:54,381 --> 00:38:56,611
- It's the first place we've been!
- Lucky us.

513
00:38:56,783 --> 00:39:00,219
Hey, there are lots of places we
can go for abuse. Come on, Dick.

514
00:39:00,387 --> 00:39:02,878
Sit down. Did I say I wasn't
giving you money? Did I?

515
00:39:03,056 --> 00:39:05,388
- No. It's just that...
- Sit down.

516
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,294
Let's look at the pluses and minuses.

517
00:39:09,463 --> 00:39:12,591
- There are a couple...
- We'll start with the minuses.

518
00:39:15,435 --> 00:39:18,131
You two are in hock up to your eyes.

519
00:39:18,472 --> 00:39:20,804
You have nothing serious for collateral.

520
00:39:21,141 --> 00:39:25,305
You're behind in both mortgages, so
we're third in line behind the bank?

521
00:39:26,379 --> 00:39:28,347
And your car is paid for.

522
00:39:28,882 --> 00:39:31,248
But that car and a dime
would get you a cup of coffee.

523
00:39:31,418 --> 00:39:35,855
That's a perfectly good late-model car
worth at least a thousand dollars.

524
00:39:37,057 --> 00:39:39,548
You have some jewelry.
Might be worth a few bucks.

525
00:39:39,726 --> 00:39:42,559
- The car's at least $900.
- I haven't come to the pluses.

526
00:39:42,729 --> 00:39:44,856
Will you wait for me
to come to the pluses?

527
00:39:45,131 --> 00:39:46,564
Okay.

528
00:39:48,201 --> 00:39:52,137
On the plus side, you,
Mrs. Harper...

529
00:39:52,305 --> 00:39:54,034
...are actually working!
- Yes.

530
00:39:54,207 --> 00:39:58,234
Getting paid bupkes, but you're
working. It's regular. And you...

531
00:39:59,646 --> 00:40:02,046
You could get another
job. Who knows?

532
00:40:02,215 --> 00:40:04,342
They might find a cure for cancer, right?

533
00:40:04,684 --> 00:40:06,379
Will you get to the bottom line?

534
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:12,522
The bottom line is that I love people.
So I'm going to let you have...

535
00:40:15,028 --> 00:40:17,895
...$ 1000 for one year at
18 and a half compounded.

536
00:40:18,632 --> 00:40:21,897
- A thousand dollars?
- 18 and a half? That's against the law.

537
00:40:22,068 --> 00:40:23,160
Take it or leave it.

538
00:40:23,336 --> 00:40:24,530
- We'll take it!
- We'll leave it!

539
00:40:24,704 --> 00:40:26,535
- We'll leave it!
- We'll take it!

540
00:40:27,908 --> 00:40:30,877
Seven, eight, nine, 1000.
Thank you.

541
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:40,047
This is a holdup! If nobody moves,
nobody gets hurt! Lie down!

542
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:42,051
- Hands up!
- You said nobody move!

543
00:40:42,222 --> 00:40:43,917
- Shut up!
- I wouldn't offend you.

544
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:46,581
- I told you to lie down and shut up!
- Count on it!

545
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,567
Come on, man!

546
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,940
- I just borrowed this.
- Now you're loaning it.

547
00:41:03,109 --> 00:41:05,475
- Borrow it from him.
- This is legally yours.

548
00:41:05,645 --> 00:41:09,445
- I'm paying it back. What's the interest?
- You already signed the papers.

549
00:41:09,616 --> 00:41:11,174
- Shut up!
- Can we clear this up?

550
00:41:11,351 --> 00:41:14,149
- Who are you stealing this from?
- Shut up!

551
00:41:15,822 --> 00:41:18,586
- What was that?
- It was me. My gun went off.

552
00:41:18,758 --> 00:41:20,453
That'll bring all the heat.

553
00:41:20,627 --> 00:41:22,424
- Did you get the money?
- Yeah.

554
00:41:22,596 --> 00:41:25,463
- Get the broad.
- Hey, man, let's go!

555
00:41:25,632 --> 00:41:29,363
- On your feet, you're coming with us.
- Hey, hold it!

556
00:41:39,546 --> 00:41:41,673
- Where the hell are they?
- Out the back.

557
00:41:41,848 --> 00:41:43,247
They got a woman with them!

558
00:41:43,416 --> 00:41:45,646
Come on, lady, get up!

559
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:47,144
Hold it, police!

560
00:41:47,721 --> 00:41:48,847
Wait, man!

561
00:41:58,598 --> 00:42:02,728
- You want to go to the hospital?
- I'm all right. Jane, are you?

562
00:42:02,936 --> 00:42:05,769
- I'd just like to go home.
- Well, you're free to go.

563
00:42:06,006 --> 00:42:10,636
- You sure were cool under fire, ma'am.
- I'll faint at home. Thanks.

564
00:42:11,611 --> 00:42:13,238
Sorry.

565
00:42:13,446 --> 00:42:17,405
Mr. Harper? How much did you
tell them that you lost?

566
00:42:17,651 --> 00:42:19,118
$ 1000. What do you mean?

567
00:42:19,352 --> 00:42:20,819
You couldn't tell them $2000?

568
00:42:20,987 --> 00:42:25,151
Insurance would have paid. I would have
split the extra grand with you. Schmuck.

569
00:42:31,765 --> 00:42:34,290
- Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.
- Billy, are you going outside?

570
00:42:34,467 --> 00:42:35,456
Yeah.

571
00:42:35,635 --> 00:42:37,500
- Hi, Bill.
- Hi.

572
00:42:42,475 --> 00:42:44,409
Are you feeling all right?

573
00:42:45,645 --> 00:42:47,772
Come in and close the door.

574
00:42:49,649 --> 00:42:51,139
Lock it.

575
00:42:54,287 --> 00:42:58,815
They dropped it, I fell on it, and while the
police chased them I put it in my bag.

576
00:42:59,192 --> 00:43:00,784
Oh, my God!

577
00:43:01,061 --> 00:43:03,586
I don't know what happened to me.
I just did it.

578
00:43:03,763 --> 00:43:07,255
- There's 2000 dollars here.
- I can't believe I did it.

579
00:43:07,434 --> 00:43:10,801
- Neither can I.
- It's not funny. I've committed a crime.

580
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:12,801
And done a hell of a job at it.

581
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:16,608
Why didn't I give it back?

582
00:43:16,776 --> 00:43:19,176
It never occurred
to me to give it back.

583
00:43:19,345 --> 00:43:22,371
- You're sensational.
- I can't believe it. Stop it, Dick.

584
00:43:22,749 --> 00:43:25,445
Would you turn on the faucet?

585
00:43:25,852 --> 00:43:28,946
- I'm going to give it back.
- To who, the robbers?

586
00:43:29,589 --> 00:43:31,955
The money belongs to the loan...

587
00:43:32,992 --> 00:43:35,552
- They have insurance, don't they?
- Exactly.

588
00:43:35,762 --> 00:43:37,923
Suppose they catch those guys.
They saw me.

589
00:43:38,098 --> 00:43:42,194
They'll never catch them. Even if they
finger you, who's going to believe them?

590
00:43:42,368 --> 00:43:45,667
The cops won't believe them.
They'll think they spent it all.

591
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:48,000
I can't believe we're talking like this.

592
00:43:48,441 --> 00:43:51,342
Dick. We've always done
things the straight way.

593
00:43:51,511 --> 00:43:55,743
Yeah, well, I'm tired of
belonging to a minority group.

594
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:59,014
Okay.

595
00:43:59,252 --> 00:44:02,153
- Okay, I'm going to keep it.
- Good.

596
00:44:02,622 --> 00:44:06,319
- I'm going to keep it.
- That's still good.

597
00:44:07,761 --> 00:44:11,458
Hey. Do you think it would be awful
if we had a little celebration?

598
00:44:11,798 --> 00:44:15,290
- Something besides Hamburger Helper?
- A little red wine.

599
00:44:15,468 --> 00:44:19,336
How about a little champagne?

600
00:44:21,007 --> 00:44:24,443
- Love you.
- I love you.

601
00:44:29,315 --> 00:44:32,512
Got the lights. We got our lights back.

602
00:44:33,019 --> 00:44:34,782
I propose a toast.

603
00:44:34,954 --> 00:44:37,388
- Down with candles.
- Down with imitation mayonnaise.

604
00:44:37,557 --> 00:44:40,321
- Down with Hamburger Helper.
- Up the Harpers.

605
00:44:41,027 --> 00:44:42,824
Here's looking at you, Spot.

606
00:44:43,296 --> 00:44:44,285
Wow.

607
00:44:44,464 --> 00:44:46,830
- You can have some.
- Will you get that, honey?

608
00:44:47,033 --> 00:44:48,830
- Sure.
- Spotty, old boy.

609
00:44:50,003 --> 00:44:53,530
- Yes?
- Is this the residence of Richard Harper?

610
00:44:59,012 --> 00:45:00,502
Yes, I'm Mrs. Harper.

611
00:45:01,114 --> 00:45:03,742
You've applied for the
food stamp program?

612
00:45:04,751 --> 00:45:05,775
That's right.

613
00:45:05,952 --> 00:45:09,683
My name is Johnson. I'm the
income maintenance technician.

614
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:11,279
The what?

615
00:45:11,457 --> 00:45:13,857
I've come for the inspection.

616
00:45:16,329 --> 00:45:19,196
- Tonight?
- Want to see my credentials, lady?

617
00:45:19,699 --> 00:45:22,429
No. No.

618
00:45:23,837 --> 00:45:25,134
Please come in.

619
00:45:35,415 --> 00:45:39,613
Darling, this is Mr. Johnson.
The income maintenance mechanic.

620
00:45:39,786 --> 00:45:41,117
Technician.

621
00:45:41,487 --> 00:45:44,513
The food stamps fellow.

622
00:45:54,801 --> 00:45:58,897
- Have you eaten, Mr. Johnson?
- Yes, I had a Big Mac and a small fries.

623
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:03,434
- You don't understand...
- Don't I?

624
00:46:05,378 --> 00:46:08,745
- Would you like some champagne?
- And I also had a Coke.

625
00:46:11,551 --> 00:46:15,783
Truth is, we ripped off a loan company,
and this is the last of our proceeds.

626
00:46:16,389 --> 00:46:18,482
I see, yes.

627
00:46:19,492 --> 00:46:22,359
You want to see if we have
any cooking facilities, right?

628
00:46:23,563 --> 00:46:25,497
Yes. Yes, that's the first thing.

629
00:46:26,633 --> 00:46:28,225
This way.

630
00:46:33,907 --> 00:46:36,171
You don't have any assets
other than what's here?

631
00:46:36,509 --> 00:46:37,635
That's it.

632
00:46:39,045 --> 00:46:41,536
You sure messed up real good.

633
00:46:42,882 --> 00:46:43,974
We sure did.

634
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:47,176
Never mind the editorials,
are we eligible or not?

635
00:46:48,855 --> 00:46:52,222
- According to the rules, you're eligible.
- Thank you.

636
00:46:52,525 --> 00:46:56,325
Don't thank me. It's people like you
who give this program a bad name.

637
00:46:56,496 --> 00:46:58,521
Screw it up for others who need it.

638
00:46:58,965 --> 00:47:00,330
I don't think that's fair.

639
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:04,231
Jane, the old rich are
always sticking it to the new rich.

640
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:06,929
The old poor have to stick
it to the nouveau poor.

641
00:47:07,106 --> 00:47:10,166
- We, in this case, are the nouveau poor.
- We really need it.

642
00:47:10,343 --> 00:47:13,107
No one in this house or in
this neighborhood needs it.

643
00:47:13,279 --> 00:47:17,511
Really? You think we should sell
this house and move to a slum.

644
00:47:17,684 --> 00:47:19,549
We should sell before the bank does.

645
00:47:19,719 --> 00:47:22,085
- Which is next week.
- You can just forget it.

646
00:47:22,255 --> 00:47:24,246
- We're keeping this house.
- How?

647
00:47:24,424 --> 00:47:26,449
- We'll make the payments!
- With what?

648
00:47:26,859 --> 00:47:30,192
You have accepted our current
problems as permanent. They are not.

649
00:47:30,363 --> 00:47:31,830
This is only temporary.

650
00:47:31,998 --> 00:47:33,932
You haven't told me how we'll
make the payments!

651
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:37,226
The middle class is the
backbone of this country.

652
00:47:37,403 --> 00:47:40,804
We've got to survive. If we go
under, the whole country can.

653
00:47:40,974 --> 00:47:44,341
And in these, our bicentennial
years, my contribution...

654
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:47,775
...isn't the destruction of
the American middle class!

655
00:47:47,947 --> 00:47:51,542
I don't know what you're...
Billy, entertain our guest, please.

656
00:47:51,851 --> 00:47:55,343
- We have nothing to worry about?
- Right. Nothing to worry about.

657
00:47:55,521 --> 00:47:58,046
- I'll speak to the bank tomorrow.
- I spoke to them today.

658
00:47:58,224 --> 00:48:00,692
He said, "You are no
longer banking with us...

659
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:03,920
...we're banking with you."
- Very funny. Leave it to me.

660
00:48:04,097 --> 00:48:05,997
- We'll make the payment.
- With what?

661
00:48:06,165 --> 00:48:07,632
We'll make the payment.

662
00:48:19,779 --> 00:48:21,371
This is a stickup.

663
00:48:22,348 --> 00:48:23,542
Stick them up.

664
00:48:24,951 --> 00:48:26,077
Stick them up.

665
00:48:26,452 --> 00:48:29,353
Stick them up. Stick them up.

666
00:48:34,627 --> 00:48:39,155
This is a stickup! Stick
them up! Stick them up!

667
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:41,894
Stick them up.

668
00:48:42,235 --> 00:48:43,725
Stick them up.

669
00:48:43,936 --> 00:48:45,494
Are you kidding?

670
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:48,571
Are you crazy?

671
00:48:48,841 --> 00:48:52,971
Don't come in when I have a gun in my
hand! You'll get your head blown off!

672
00:48:53,212 --> 00:48:57,273
Take that ridiculous thing off your face.
I can't hear a word you're saying.

673
00:48:57,550 --> 00:49:00,280
Never sneak up on a man
holding a gun. You can get killed.

674
00:49:00,453 --> 00:49:02,148
- What are you doing with a gun?
- I'm...

675
00:49:02,321 --> 00:49:04,312
Never mind.
I know what you're gonna do.

676
00:49:04,490 --> 00:49:07,584
Yeah, well, you're right about that.

677
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,785
And give me the keys to the car.

678
00:49:09,962 --> 00:49:13,125
- Hasn't this gone far enough?
- You're not gonna stop me.

679
00:49:13,299 --> 00:49:16,496
I'm gonna get that money.

680
00:49:16,669 --> 00:49:19,331
Is getting arrested gonna help us
get the money?

681
00:49:19,505 --> 00:49:21,496
You don't think I can do it, do you?

682
00:49:21,674 --> 00:49:23,904
I'm a washout. I'm a loser.

683
00:49:24,077 --> 00:49:28,013
Not even capable of holding up
a goddamn grocery store.

684
00:49:28,181 --> 00:49:30,809
Any idiot can hold up a grocery store.

685
00:49:30,983 --> 00:49:33,178
Thank you.

686
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:42,722
- You're really determined to do this.
- That's right, Jane.

687
00:49:42,895 --> 00:49:44,829
- That what you're gonna wear?
- Yeah.

688
00:49:44,997 --> 00:49:46,988
- What do you think?
- I think you look like...

689
00:49:47,166 --> 00:49:49,361
...the Easter Bunny bandit.
- I had to ask.

690
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:52,060
You might as well wear a sign
that says, "Arrest me."

691
00:49:52,271 --> 00:49:54,466
Okay, what do you think I should wear?

692
00:49:54,874 --> 00:49:58,002
Why don't you wear something
a little more inconspicuous, like...

693
00:49:58,177 --> 00:49:59,542
...the Batman costume?

694
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:14,485
How's this?

695
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:15,786
It's fine.

696
00:50:15,962 --> 00:50:18,453
Okay, baby. I'm off.

697
00:50:18,631 --> 00:50:19,757
- Dick?
- Yeah?

698
00:50:19,932 --> 00:50:22,901
Don't you think we've
forgotten something?

699
00:50:23,069 --> 00:50:25,401
The iron. Right.

700
00:50:35,181 --> 00:50:38,241
Dick, don't you think that gun
is gonna attract attention...

701
00:50:38,417 --> 00:50:42,012
...sticking out of your belt like that?
- I'll wear a jacket. Don't worry.

702
00:50:42,188 --> 00:50:44,713
I have to worry. I was a psych major.

703
00:50:44,891 --> 00:50:47,291
You know what Freud said.
Criminals leave clues.

704
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:49,485
They have a compulsion to confess.

705
00:50:49,662 --> 00:50:53,291
I have a compulsion to pay the mortgage.
Did Freud write about that? No.

706
00:50:53,466 --> 00:50:56,902
So there. That takes care of Freud.

707
00:50:59,539 --> 00:51:02,007
- Hello, Mr. Harper.
- Hello, Carol.

708
00:51:02,175 --> 00:51:04,439
Jane, what is Carol doing here?

709
00:51:04,610 --> 00:51:06,601
I'm going with you
to your meeting tonight.

710
00:51:06,779 --> 00:51:10,078
You are not. You're staying here.
I'm going alone.

711
00:51:10,249 --> 00:51:13,912
On the contrary, darling. I wouldn't want
to miss one of your business meetings.

712
00:51:14,086 --> 00:51:17,112
Never know what might happen.
Don't forget to go to bed at 9:30.

713
00:51:17,290 --> 00:51:19,952
- Don't worry, Mrs. Harper.
- Carol, I'm taking you home.

714
00:51:20,126 --> 00:51:22,060
- Sit down, Carol.
- On your feet, Carol.

715
00:51:22,228 --> 00:51:23,320
- Sit down.
- Carol.

716
00:51:23,496 --> 00:51:26,294
- Stay.
- Okay, stay. Both of you, all of you.

717
00:51:26,465 --> 00:51:28,296
Goodnight, have a good time.

718
00:51:30,336 --> 00:51:31,769
Billy!

719
00:51:32,071 --> 00:51:36,235
Billy, you know what the vet said about
Spot sitting so close to the television.

720
00:51:53,993 --> 00:51:56,791
All right, Jane, you can come.

721
00:51:57,797 --> 00:52:00,664
As long as you promise to do
exactly what I tell you.

722
00:52:00,833 --> 00:52:04,200
- I promise.
- You drive.

723
00:52:17,783 --> 00:52:21,241
- What happened?
- I think I ruptured myself.

724
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:25,782
You realize if that thing goes off, you'll
be going on this robbery half-cocked.

725
00:52:25,958 --> 00:52:29,223
Very funny. Just drive, damn it!

726
00:52:35,935 --> 00:52:37,800
How did you happen to pick Monrovia?

727
00:52:38,004 --> 00:52:40,871
I wanted an area far enough
away from us. Any objections?

728
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,770
- Oh, no.
- I can't believe it.

729
00:52:43,943 --> 00:52:47,242
- I am curious about one thing, though.
- I knew it.

730
00:52:47,413 --> 00:52:51,679
How were you going to get to the scene
of the crime if I hadn't come home? Cab?

731
00:52:51,851 --> 00:52:55,184
I was going to steal a car.

732
00:52:57,290 --> 00:52:59,690
Dick, that I would like to see.

733
00:53:00,059 --> 00:53:03,028
We'll be using what is known
as the "two-car method."

734
00:53:03,195 --> 00:53:05,186
- Really?
- You park your regular car...

735
00:53:05,364 --> 00:53:09,323
...steal a car for the actual robbery,
return later to pick up your regular car.

736
00:53:09,535 --> 00:53:11,332
Dick.

737
00:53:11,504 --> 00:53:13,472
Richard, you can't steal a car.

738
00:53:13,639 --> 00:53:16,836
Put a man on the moon.
I think I can steal a car.

739
00:53:23,582 --> 00:53:25,209
Will you stop that whistling?

740
00:53:36,228 --> 00:53:38,628
There's something wrong
with this car. It won't start.

741
00:53:38,931 --> 00:53:43,425
- Why don't you kick it.
- That's right, Jane, just keep riding me.

742
00:53:43,602 --> 00:53:44,728
That's a big help.

743
00:53:46,372 --> 00:53:48,863
If I could just find a Hudson,
wouldn't be any problem.

744
00:53:49,041 --> 00:53:51,032
- Why don't you try this car?
- What?

745
00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:54,441
- Why don't you give this one a shot?
- I don't know foreign cars.

746
00:53:55,014 --> 00:53:58,279
I think you can handle this one,
Dick. The keys are in it.

747
00:54:02,188 --> 00:54:03,450
You.

748
00:54:15,735 --> 00:54:18,397
D is for "drive," dear.

749
00:54:30,316 --> 00:54:32,443
What do you think?

750
00:54:32,618 --> 00:54:36,520
It's too big, it's too bright,
it's crowded. It's ridiculous.

751
00:54:36,689 --> 00:54:39,089
Why are all these people
out shopping this late?

752
00:54:39,258 --> 00:54:41,852
They ought to be home in bed.

753
00:55:05,117 --> 00:55:08,382
- This is it, as they say.
- Let's go home before it's too late.

754
00:55:08,587 --> 00:55:10,782
- Goddamn it, Jane...
- We're not cut out for this.

755
00:55:10,956 --> 00:55:12,787
...I told you I'd do this,
and I mean it.

756
00:55:12,992 --> 00:55:14,482
Sweetie, we'll get the money.

757
00:55:14,693 --> 00:55:17,321
It's not the money,
it's the principle of the thing.

758
00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:20,328
- What principle in robbing a drugstore?
- That's right.

759
00:55:20,533 --> 00:55:24,867
It's the money, that's the principle.
That's the principle of the thing.

760
00:55:25,037 --> 00:55:27,335
You wouldn't understand.
Now don't interfere.

761
00:55:29,008 --> 00:55:31,101
You stay right there.

762
00:55:31,277 --> 00:55:35,839
I'm going in alone, and I don't
want any crap about it.

763
00:55:49,495 --> 00:55:51,087
Kind of a light door.

764
00:56:08,647 --> 00:56:10,444
Yes?

765
00:56:11,150 --> 00:56:12,981
Yes...

766
00:56:17,723 --> 00:56:22,353
- May I help you, sir?
- May you help me? Yeah.

767
00:56:29,235 --> 00:56:32,568
Don't you worry, son.
I think I've got what you're looking for.

768
00:56:32,771 --> 00:56:35,797
Now, here they are, right here.

769
00:56:35,975 --> 00:56:38,773
Some of these are lubricated.

770
00:56:38,944 --> 00:56:42,710
Now, this isn't lubricated,
but it's a good one.

771
00:56:42,882 --> 00:56:47,785
And some of these are
contoured for better fit.

772
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:51,380
We've got them in different colors.
We've got cherry red...

773
00:56:51,557 --> 00:56:56,460
...and we've got midnight blue,
and we've got the rainbow.

774
00:56:56,862 --> 00:56:59,490
- I'll take them all.
- All?

775
00:56:59,665 --> 00:57:02,361
Yeah, yeah.
And wrap them up.

776
00:57:03,035 --> 00:57:07,972
That'll be 8.50.
I wish I were as young as you are.

777
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:11,075
- You don't understand.
- What do you mean, I don't understand?

778
00:57:11,243 --> 00:57:14,440
I'm not that old. There you are.

779
00:57:33,165 --> 00:57:34,860
Now can we go home?

780
00:57:35,067 --> 00:57:38,935
I came out here to do something,
and I'm gonna do it.

781
00:57:44,476 --> 00:57:47,934
This evening could turn out to be
quite expensive, what with gas...

782
00:57:48,113 --> 00:57:50,206
...and sundry items.

783
00:58:24,550 --> 00:58:27,747
Ever hear of a delicatessen that
wouldn't take cash after 10:00?

784
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:29,512
Not a nickel in the register.

785
00:58:29,688 --> 00:58:32,714
- You got somebody to open the register?
- That's right, Jane.

786
00:58:32,891 --> 00:58:35,451
Was she very old
or just crippled and blind?

787
00:58:35,628 --> 00:58:38,825
For your information,
she was quite able...

788
00:59:00,185 --> 00:59:04,349
Nobody move, this is a stickup.
Nobody move.

789
00:59:11,363 --> 00:59:14,423
Just hold it right there. Nobody move.

790
00:59:35,587 --> 00:59:38,715
When did they start busing white
robbers into black neighborhoods?

791
00:59:42,795 --> 00:59:46,595
- What happened?
- No bullets. Thanks a lot.

792
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:50,465
You had to talk me into carrying an
empty gun. I could have gotten killed.

793
00:59:50,636 --> 00:59:53,298
- Please, tell me what happened.
- Nothing happened.

794
00:59:53,472 --> 00:59:58,239
Except I almost got killed, thanks to you.
I knew I shouldn't have brought you.

795
00:59:58,410 --> 01:00:01,470
You would have been busted
in the parking lot without me.

796
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:04,581
How can anybody do anything
with this kind of defeatist talk?

797
01:00:04,950 --> 01:00:09,580
Okay. Maybe there's an orphanage
around. They usually deal in cash, we...

798
01:00:09,788 --> 01:00:11,779
Just shut up, Jane.

799
01:00:35,581 --> 01:00:36,980
What do you think you're doing?

800
01:00:37,149 --> 01:00:39,174
Sitting in a stolen car
makes me nervous.

801
01:00:39,351 --> 01:00:41,945
- I'm going with you, where it's safe.
- Get back in the car.

802
01:00:42,121 --> 01:00:44,112
I said, get back in the car.

803
01:00:44,289 --> 01:00:47,190
That's right. You said, "Get back
in the car," and then I said no.

804
01:00:47,392 --> 01:00:51,590
I'm going in there, and you
better stay right here.

805
01:00:57,002 --> 01:01:01,268
Do you have to louse everything up?
First the pantyhose, then you insisted...

806
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:03,499
You still want pantyhose?
You want pantyhose?

807
01:01:03,675 --> 01:01:05,836
Will you put your pants on,
for God's sake?

808
01:01:06,011 --> 01:01:08,946
Right. This is a respectable
X-rated motel.

809
01:01:09,114 --> 01:01:10,741
I'm warning you.

810
01:01:10,949 --> 01:01:12,416
That bitch, I could kill her.

811
01:01:12,584 --> 01:01:13,949
Whatever turns you on, man.

812
01:01:14,119 --> 01:01:16,917
I don't want any shit out of you,
or I'll blow your head off.

813
01:01:17,089 --> 01:01:19,614
Turn around, put your hands
against the wall. The sill.

814
01:01:19,792 --> 01:01:22,386
Just cool it with that gun, okay?

815
01:01:24,129 --> 01:01:25,391
- Oh, Jesus!
- Oh, my God!

816
01:01:25,564 --> 01:01:28,158
I forgot to go to the bank today.
Harley's gonna kill me.

817
01:01:28,333 --> 01:01:31,200
- He's gonna skin my ass.
- You got something to put this in?

818
01:01:31,370 --> 01:01:33,634
- There's a box on the top shelf.
- Who's Harley?

819
01:01:33,806 --> 01:01:36,707
- The owner. A mean mother.
- Is he really gonna hurt you?

820
01:01:38,210 --> 01:01:40,542
Dick, he's gonna hurt him.
Maybe we shouldn't.

821
01:01:40,746 --> 01:01:42,373
What are you, crazy?

822
01:01:42,781 --> 01:01:44,942
You stand right there.
Don't move nothing.

823
01:01:45,117 --> 01:01:47,051
- I'm sorry.
- Come on, will you?

824
01:01:53,725 --> 01:01:54,714
Goodbye.

825
01:02:15,047 --> 01:02:17,345
They're gonna call us
the "Bickering Bandits."

826
01:02:17,516 --> 01:02:19,279
- That'll be our M.O.
- Right.

827
01:02:19,451 --> 01:02:21,681
- Sure.
- Right. What?

828
01:02:21,854 --> 01:02:25,187
M.O. That's modus operandi.
That's method of operation, you know.

829
01:02:25,357 --> 01:02:27,689
Wait a minute.
We're not having any modus operandi.

830
01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:30,055
- No modus operandi?
- No, tonight was it.

831
01:02:30,229 --> 01:02:33,289
- Halloween comes but once a year.
- Oh, sure.

832
01:02:35,767 --> 01:02:38,668
- Take that one.
- What? I liked it.

833
01:02:38,837 --> 01:02:40,862
- That was too casual.
- What was too casual?

834
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:43,166
You gotta promise me.

835
01:02:43,775 --> 01:02:45,208
- You promise me?
- Promise you?

836
01:02:45,377 --> 01:02:47,436
- You promise me?
- Boy, do I promise you.

837
01:02:47,613 --> 01:02:48,910
- You promise?
- Completely.

838
01:02:49,081 --> 01:02:50,878
Okay.

839
01:04:05,290 --> 01:04:06,814
- Hi. Can I help you, sir?
- Hi.

840
01:04:06,992 --> 01:04:09,017
There's something
wrong with this record.

841
01:04:09,194 --> 01:04:11,560
- What's that?
- There's a gun in it. This is a holdup.

842
01:04:11,730 --> 01:04:16,190
- Do exactly as I say, no one gets hurt.
- Sounds fair to me.

843
01:04:16,501 --> 01:04:20,835
Just keep looking at me and smiling.
Have any Bessie Smith records?

844
01:04:21,006 --> 01:04:22,871
- Bessie Smith?
- She's an old blues singer.

845
01:04:23,075 --> 01:04:27,273
- Yes, sir. Yes, I believe we do, sir.
- Do you like that old jazz?

846
01:04:27,446 --> 01:04:30,938
Well, I like the more modern
kind of stuff. You know, progressive...

847
01:04:31,550 --> 01:04:35,213
Miles and, you know, a few people,
like Sedaka. He's good.

848
01:04:35,387 --> 01:04:39,517
The lady will be leaving soon, and you'll
say, "Thank you very much, Mrs. Jones."

849
01:04:39,725 --> 01:04:42,023
Thank you very much, Mrs. Jones. Okay.

850
01:04:42,627 --> 01:04:45,892
- Nice smile. Go, go.
- Thank you very much, Mrs. Jones.

851
01:04:46,064 --> 01:04:48,794
- Think nothing of it.
- Very nice. I liked the smile.

852
01:04:50,102 --> 01:04:55,233
I'm leaving now. Say to me, "I'll get that
record for you next week, Mr. Jones."

853
01:04:56,141 --> 01:04:57,130
Now!

854
01:04:57,843 --> 01:05:01,108
I'll get that Bessie Jones
record for you next week, Mr. Smith.

855
01:05:01,279 --> 01:05:03,179
Thank you.

856
01:05:05,150 --> 01:05:08,916
Oh, yeah. 4.98, tax and license.

857
01:05:15,794 --> 01:05:20,857
How was the food, folks?
That bad, huh?

858
01:05:22,434 --> 01:05:25,870
Oh, baby. Baby.

859
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:37,840
Oh, God.

860
01:05:38,016 --> 01:05:42,783
- Oh, God, Dick, I'm ruined for life.
- Oh, honey.

861
01:05:42,954 --> 01:05:45,923
I wanna know the name of the
pervert who shut off my phone.

862
01:05:46,091 --> 01:05:49,891
In spite of what you think, we do not
get our kicks cutting off telephones.

863
01:05:50,062 --> 01:05:52,121
- I never got a bill.
- Excuse me, I'm sorry.

864
01:05:52,297 --> 01:05:55,357
- Excuse my ass.
- You'll have to wait in line like...

865
01:05:55,534 --> 01:05:59,129
I'm sorry, excuse me, but I'm afraid
this is what they call a stickup.

866
01:05:59,337 --> 01:06:01,362
They're holding up
the telephone company!

867
01:06:01,573 --> 01:06:03,837
Shoot out the computers
while you're at it.

868
01:06:04,776 --> 01:06:08,837
- All right. Right on!
- God bless you. Give them a hand!

869
01:06:09,581 --> 01:06:13,039
- Beautiful. Beautiful.
- All right!

870
01:06:24,296 --> 01:06:27,891
He's had several offers, but because
of his investments he doesn't have to...

871
01:06:28,066 --> 01:06:31,502
...rush into anything. He's looking
for a very dynamic situation...

872
01:06:31,670 --> 01:06:33,831
...in a company like yours, Jason.

873
01:06:34,005 --> 01:06:36,496
- Are you familiar with the film business?
- Somewhat.

874
01:06:36,675 --> 01:06:39,735
Hey, how about a drink? Come on.

875
01:06:42,414 --> 01:06:44,382
You're welcome.

876
01:06:51,990 --> 01:06:54,686
You've got to go down there.
You owe it to yourself...

877
01:06:54,860 --> 01:06:57,522
- May I borrow my husband?
- Be my guest, Jane.

878
01:06:57,696 --> 01:07:00,688
- Dick.
- Jane, I was making some progress.

879
01:07:00,866 --> 01:07:03,198
That's the condominium king.

880
01:07:03,368 --> 01:07:05,666
You're an aerospace executive,
not a...

881
01:07:05,837 --> 01:07:08,670
Right now I'm feeling pretty flexible.

882
01:07:18,016 --> 01:07:20,143
- Raoul.
- Oh, no, that's okay.

883
01:07:20,318 --> 01:07:22,479
Go and enjoy yourself.
Let me do it, okay?

884
01:07:22,654 --> 01:07:25,122
Mum's the word, eh, Raoul?

885
01:07:31,329 --> 01:07:34,127
This is something else.
Did you find buried treasure?

886
01:07:34,299 --> 01:07:37,325
Living off my investments, Nesbitt.

887
01:07:43,275 --> 01:07:47,609
- Dick. Put her there, pal.
- Glad you could make it. Hello, Mildred.

888
01:07:47,779 --> 01:07:51,647
<i>Olé</i>, Ricardo. We wouldn't
have missed this for the world.

889
01:07:51,816 --> 01:07:55,377
- I love your small pool, Jane. It's so cozy.
- Thank you, Mildred.

890
01:07:55,554 --> 01:07:59,991
- I see you landed on your feet.
- Actually, Charlie, I landed on my ass.

891
01:08:00,158 --> 01:08:03,355
Then, when I fell off my ass,
I had no place to go but my feet.

892
01:08:03,528 --> 01:08:05,996
- What line are you in?
- Robber.

893
01:08:06,164 --> 01:08:10,157
- As in tires and erasers.
- That's a good field.

894
01:08:11,002 --> 01:08:14,665
- Do you make it or sell it?
- Steal it.

895
01:08:14,873 --> 01:08:18,001
Like stealing candy from a baby.
He is so modest.

896
01:08:18,176 --> 01:08:21,805
- Steel. Hey, there's a solid industry.
- I thought he said rubber.

897
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:24,744
Actually, Jane's working now too,
aren't you, Jane?

898
01:08:24,916 --> 01:08:26,884
- What are you doing?
- <i>Adiós.</i>

899
01:08:27,052 --> 01:08:30,852
Investments. Investments.
She's in charge of salting it away.

900
01:08:31,056 --> 01:08:33,752
- Got the guts of a bandit.
- Maybe you could help me.

901
01:08:33,925 --> 01:08:36,985
I have to go to Washington next week.
But I'll give you a...

902
01:08:37,162 --> 01:08:38,993
A little call when I get back.

903
01:08:39,264 --> 01:08:41,664
That could be 15 years to life.

904
01:08:42,167 --> 01:08:45,034
I'm just going to talk to a
congressional committee.

905
01:08:45,237 --> 01:08:48,206
They think Charlie's been paying off
people besides them.

906
01:08:48,406 --> 01:08:49,930
Larry Maguire!

907
01:08:50,809 --> 01:08:53,141
- That's not Larry.
- Taquito?

908
01:08:53,311 --> 01:08:55,074
Thank you.

909
01:09:00,819 --> 01:09:05,313
Is it burning you, Mildred? That's
too bad. Would you like some water?

910
01:09:05,490 --> 01:09:08,050
- I'll get some water.
- Tequila, please.

911
01:09:09,094 --> 01:09:14,657
And now, once again,
bringing you salvation and success...

912
01:09:14,866 --> 01:09:20,862
...righteousness and riches,
the Reverend Dr. Thomas Will.

913
01:09:26,344 --> 01:09:30,747
You know, we've all heard the expression
"The meek shall inherit the earth."

914
01:09:31,349 --> 01:09:34,546
Well, that is exactly what
they're gonna get. Dirt.

915
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:40,548
We all have to learn how to be positive.
You see, I don't want you to say "Amen."

916
01:09:40,725 --> 01:09:44,491
- I want you to say "I am."
- I am.

917
01:09:44,896 --> 01:09:47,865
You have to remember
that God is in you.

918
01:09:48,033 --> 01:09:50,831
And in you and in you
and in you and in me.

919
01:09:51,136 --> 01:09:54,333
Now, if you open up your heart
and you let God inside...

920
01:09:54,506 --> 01:09:57,942
...he will make you rich.
- I am.

921
01:09:58,143 --> 01:10:03,775
Let me remind you
that the cross is a plus sign.

922
01:10:03,982 --> 01:10:07,509
Now, I want you all to repeat after me:
Money loves me.

923
01:10:07,686 --> 01:10:11,053
- Money loves me.
- Money loves to be in my pocket.

924
01:10:11,256 --> 01:10:14,919
- Money loves to be in my pocket.
- I see a whole mountain...

925
01:10:15,093 --> 01:10:16,583
...of money coming towards me.

926
01:10:16,761 --> 01:10:19,730
I see a mountain of money
coming towards me.

927
01:10:19,898 --> 01:10:23,766
Now, I want you all to donate generously
to the ministry today. And remember...

928
01:10:23,935 --> 01:10:26,927
...that every dollar you give,
God will pay back tenfold...

929
01:10:27,105 --> 01:10:30,302
...in some wondrous
and mysterious and exciting way.

930
01:10:30,508 --> 01:10:32,942
A car, a boat, a plane, a home.

931
01:10:33,445 --> 01:10:35,379
Just one other couple, Dr. Will.

932
01:10:35,547 --> 01:10:38,539
Yea, I say unto you: Bring them in,
they're here to win.

933
01:10:38,717 --> 01:10:41,242
- Inspirational sermon, doctor.
- Thank you, thank you.

934
01:10:41,419 --> 01:10:45,321
Yes, particularly the part about
not feeling guilty about prospering.

935
01:10:45,490 --> 01:10:48,550
Well, you see,
that is called "Say 'I am."'

936
01:10:48,727 --> 01:10:53,096
If you want more money, you must get
an expanded idea of yourself.

937
01:10:53,264 --> 01:10:55,994
You must think of yourself
as one who has more money.

938
01:10:56,201 --> 01:10:58,601
We're trying, doctor.

939
01:10:59,204 --> 01:11:03,334
Well, go ahead. Touch it, son.
Don't be afraid. Go on.

940
01:11:04,075 --> 01:11:06,509
Go ahead, dear, touch it.

941
01:11:08,446 --> 01:11:13,679
Go on. That's it, touch it some more.

942
01:11:14,052 --> 01:11:17,283
You see, you must take the limit
off your financial thinking...

943
01:11:17,489 --> 01:11:20,424
...and you will get more money.
Don't worry about how.

944
01:11:20,625 --> 01:11:23,150
- Inspirational.
- Say "I am."

945
01:11:23,361 --> 01:11:25,158
Stick them up.

946
01:11:26,297 --> 01:11:28,822
Did I hear you right, sinner?
You holding me up?

947
01:11:29,033 --> 01:11:32,730
I am. Hands on your head, both of you.

948
01:11:35,340 --> 01:11:37,103
- Move!
- Will you get out of the way?

949
01:11:37,275 --> 01:11:42,235
- God wants you out of the way!
- Guards!

950
01:11:56,895 --> 01:11:59,796
Stop them, for they have sinned!

951
01:12:00,298 --> 01:12:03,495
Would you mind
getting the hell off the car?

952
01:12:04,102 --> 01:12:06,593
<i>Testing. Testing.</i>

953
01:12:10,074 --> 01:12:12,372
Oh, Jesus!

954
01:12:14,913 --> 01:12:17,746
- You all right?
- Yeah, I think so.

955
01:12:24,322 --> 01:12:28,156
<i>Pull over, you sinners!</i>
<i>They are thieves, stop them!</i>

956
01:12:28,326 --> 01:12:31,056
<i>They have stolen all my</i>...
<i>The Lord's money.</i>

957
01:12:31,229 --> 01:12:34,198
- Oh, no!
- God!

958
01:12:34,399 --> 01:12:37,334
<i>If you pull over at the next light,</i>
<i>God will forgive you.</i>

959
01:12:37,535 --> 01:12:39,298
- <i>He is no stool pigeon.</i>
- Oh, my God!

960
01:12:39,471 --> 01:12:42,963
<i>God does not hold a grudge.</i>
<i>Remember, thou shalt not steal.</i>

961
01:12:43,141 --> 01:12:44,870
They're coming closer to us, Dick.

962
01:12:45,076 --> 01:12:49,740
<i>That is the fourth</i>...
<i>That's one of them commandments.</i>

963
01:12:50,782 --> 01:12:53,012
<i>Give me back my</i>
<i>goddamn money, will you?</i>

964
01:12:53,184 --> 01:12:56,347
<i>Step on it. Can't you get more</i>
<i>juice out of this goddamn thing?</i>

965
01:12:56,521 --> 01:13:00,958
<i>Watch out! Jesus Christ!</i>
<i>You almost broke my ass, you fool.</i>

966
01:13:02,427 --> 01:13:03,951
Oh, a cop!

967
01:13:51,376 --> 01:13:53,401
That is my money!

968
01:14:18,536 --> 01:14:20,026
How much we get?

969
01:14:20,204 --> 01:14:23,662
Not very much. It's mostly ones.

970
01:14:23,841 --> 01:14:28,505
Mostly ones?
Hey, where's the other money?

971
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:30,648
What other money?

972
01:14:30,815 --> 01:14:33,648
All the other money,
that's what other money.

973
01:14:33,818 --> 01:14:36,810
- In the shrubbery.
- In the shrubbery?

974
01:14:36,988 --> 01:14:38,956
In the pool.

975
01:14:40,024 --> 01:14:41,548
In the swimming pool?

976
01:14:41,759 --> 01:14:44,694
It's in the utilities,
it's in the car, in the furniture...

977
01:14:44,862 --> 01:14:50,027
...it's in the mortgage, in the insurance.
It's at the Diners Club.

978
01:15:00,912 --> 01:15:05,246
Well, it's not worth it.
I'm not cut out for blue-collar crime.

979
01:15:05,416 --> 01:15:08,749
I have a white-collar mentality.
I panic in the face of death.

980
01:15:15,059 --> 01:15:17,857
Maybe we should retire.

981
01:15:23,067 --> 01:15:26,559
- Are all our debts paid?
- Yes.

982
01:15:27,205 --> 01:15:32,233
At least we won't starve. We've just been
accepted by the food stamp program.

983
01:15:32,410 --> 01:15:34,275
Hurray.

984
01:15:36,481 --> 01:15:38,210
- Charlie!
- Where?

985
01:15:39,017 --> 01:15:41,679
<i>Mr. Blanchard, I would like you</i>
<i>to tell this committee...</i>

986
01:15:41,886 --> 01:15:46,482
<i>... if you have ever, in your position</i>
<i>as president of Taft, bribed anyone...</i>

987
01:15:46,658 --> 01:15:51,186
<i>... either here or abroad, for the purpose</i>
<i>of consummating a business deal.</i>

988
01:15:51,462 --> 01:15:57,458
<i>Senator, no one at Taft Aerospace,</i>
<i>to the best of my knowledge...</i>

989
01:15:57,635 --> 01:15:59,535
<i>... ever bribed anybody.</i>

990
01:16:01,506 --> 01:16:04,805
<i>Maybe that's why business is so bad.</i>

991
01:16:05,243 --> 01:16:08,804
Look at him. Listen to him shovel it.

992
01:16:08,980 --> 01:16:13,576
There's never been a deal at Taft where
somebody didn't get paid off somewhere.

993
01:16:14,085 --> 01:16:16,952
<i>We have already elicited testimony</i>
<i>from other companies...</i>

994
01:16:17,121 --> 01:16:19,487
<i>... involved in the same</i>
<i>business as yours...</i>

995
01:16:19,657 --> 01:16:24,094
<i>... and they claim that payoffs are an</i>
<i>integral part of carrying on business.</i>

996
01:16:24,529 --> 01:16:27,623
<i>Do you mean to tell me</i>
<i>that you are the exception?</i>

997
01:16:27,832 --> 01:16:30,528
You know, guys walk into his office
and walk out again...

998
01:16:30,702 --> 01:16:34,502
...with $200,000 cash in a briefcase.

999
01:16:34,672 --> 01:16:37,937
- Two hundred thousand dollars?
- Watch him. Watch him bob and weave.

1000
01:16:40,244 --> 01:16:44,704
<i>Senator. Now, we at Taft Aerospace</i>
<i>have always prided ourselves...</i>

1001
01:16:44,882 --> 01:16:47,282
<i>... in truth on what we produce.</i>

1002
01:16:47,485 --> 01:16:51,683
- Charlie does his laundry.
- Any idea where he keeps it?

1003
01:16:51,856 --> 01:16:54,518
Yeah, in the safe in his office.

1004
01:17:00,364 --> 01:17:02,491
Fortunately, there are guards
everywhere...

1005
01:17:02,667 --> 01:17:06,034
...and I don't even have a key to
the executive washroom anymore.

1006
01:17:06,204 --> 01:17:11,141
Unfortunately, we've been invited
to a party at Taft next week.

1007
01:17:14,212 --> 01:17:17,909
Fortunately, we don't know
the first thing about safecracking.

1008
01:17:18,082 --> 01:17:22,143
Unfortunately, we are fast learners.

1009
01:17:23,621 --> 01:17:26,954
- Short retirement.
- Very.

1010
01:17:34,766 --> 01:17:36,461
- I felt it.
- Positive?

1011
01:17:36,634 --> 01:17:39,865
Of course I'm positive, honey.
It's gotta be perfect.

1012
01:17:40,037 --> 01:17:43,302
- I've been practicing for days.
- And you've almost got it. Come on.

1013
01:17:43,474 --> 01:17:45,203
You ready? Okay.

1014
01:17:45,376 --> 01:17:50,712
- Deft. Deft. And deft.
- Okay.

1015
01:17:50,882 --> 01:17:54,841
- You should tell me when I should do it.
- Whenever you're ready.

1016
01:18:26,517 --> 01:18:29,247
Well, it's just like old times.

1017
01:18:29,420 --> 01:18:33,254
- I hope you brought the old equalizer.
- Will you cut it out?

1018
01:18:33,424 --> 01:18:35,722
- Hi, Pete, how are you?
- Who is it?

1019
01:18:35,893 --> 01:18:38,987
Pete Winston. Wife, Betty.
Super Bowl, back operation.

1020
01:18:39,163 --> 01:18:42,064
- Really good to see you. How are you?
- Great. Just great.

1021
01:18:42,233 --> 01:18:43,894
You know my wife, Jane, don't you?

1022
01:18:44,068 --> 01:18:47,663
- I don't know if she'll remember me.
- Winston, how can you say that?

1023
01:18:47,839 --> 01:18:51,275
We met you and Betty at the Super Bowl
last winter. How's your back?

1024
01:18:51,442 --> 01:18:53,569
- How nice of you to remember.
- Is Betty here?

1025
01:18:53,744 --> 01:18:55,871
- She's in the back.
- I'll be glad to see her.

1026
01:18:56,047 --> 01:18:58,515
- She'd love to see you too.
- There you are.

1027
01:18:58,683 --> 01:19:00,207
- Charlie.
- What I want to know is...

1028
01:19:00,384 --> 01:19:03,182
...do I get to kiss your wife,
or do I have to make a scene?

1029
01:19:03,354 --> 01:19:07,017
- Do we know this man?
- Some guy who still works at the plant.

1030
01:19:11,863 --> 01:19:12,852
Hi, Charlie.

1031
01:19:13,030 --> 01:19:15,396
I don't know what a good-looking guy
like Dick sees in you.

1032
01:19:15,566 --> 01:19:17,932
- I do yard work.
- You can do work in my yard anytime.

1033
01:19:18,135 --> 01:19:19,534
- Charlie.
- You wanna dance?

1034
01:19:19,704 --> 01:19:21,672
I'd love to.

1035
01:19:25,109 --> 01:19:26,872
- Very nice.
- What?

1036
01:19:27,044 --> 01:19:30,980
- I said, very nice.
- Perfect.

1037
01:20:57,034 --> 01:20:58,296
Charlie, no!

1038
01:20:58,469 --> 01:21:02,166
No? I won't take "no" for an answer.
I'll be waiting.

1039
01:21:21,959 --> 01:21:24,291
Showoff.

1040
01:21:34,438 --> 01:21:38,374
Come on. Dick, Charlie's gonna
come to his office at 11:00.

1041
01:21:38,542 --> 01:21:39,873
- All right.
- We gotta hurry.

1042
01:21:40,044 --> 01:21:43,844
All right. Will you get out of the way?

1043
01:21:46,917 --> 01:21:49,215
Hey, you! Don't move.

1044
01:21:51,722 --> 01:21:54,213
Take that, you honky putz.

1045
01:22:00,965 --> 01:22:03,092
- Oh, my God!
- What?

1046
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:17,073
Come on, will you?

1047
01:22:19,917 --> 01:22:21,782
Come on.

1048
01:22:39,136 --> 01:22:40,763
- These are all make-believe.
- Dick.

1049
01:22:40,938 --> 01:22:42,838
What?

1050
01:22:43,007 --> 01:22:44,497
Does he have a closet?

1051
01:22:44,675 --> 01:22:47,439
I read in the book the most
popular place for safes are...

1052
01:22:47,611 --> 01:22:50,580
- He does indeed have a closet.
- Okay.

1053
01:22:57,521 --> 01:22:59,716
I love you, Jane.

1054
01:23:00,858 --> 01:23:06,319
- Thanks.
- Mosler, model number 1874.

1055
01:23:07,698 --> 01:23:11,759
Mosler. Okay.

1056
01:23:13,971 --> 01:23:18,169
There. Right there is where
you have to drill.

1057
01:23:32,556 --> 01:23:37,858
Dick, it's okay. You can hardly hear
the drilling out here.

1058
01:23:47,738 --> 01:23:49,865
Dick, somebody's coming.

1059
01:23:57,515 --> 01:23:59,710
In the closet.

1060
01:24:09,593 --> 01:24:13,620
- Is it the guard?
- I don't know. I couldn't see.

1061
01:24:22,373 --> 01:24:26,070
It can't be Charlie. It's only 10:15.

1062
01:24:26,243 --> 01:24:28,177
Let me look.

1063
01:24:33,417 --> 01:24:37,114
I can't see anything.
Maybe he won't look in here.

1064
01:24:37,288 --> 01:24:39,483
- Suppose he does?
- Screw him.

1065
01:24:39,657 --> 01:24:42,251
I most certainly will not.

1066
01:24:55,906 --> 01:24:58,739
- That wasn't Charlie.
- Really.

1067
01:25:18,462 --> 01:25:20,555
Come on in.

1068
01:25:31,242 --> 01:25:34,769
Hey, everybody, come on in.

1069
01:25:37,314 --> 01:25:40,545
Hey, my man, what's happening?

1070
01:25:58,502 --> 01:26:02,563
Jane! They're never going to hear the
drill over this. I'm going back to work.

1071
01:26:02,740 --> 01:26:05,004
If somebody's coming, just let me know.

1072
01:26:38,976 --> 01:26:41,706
Jane, it's your turn.

1073
01:27:29,059 --> 01:27:32,722
- It's all the money in the world.
- It gives me goose flesh.

1074
01:27:33,564 --> 01:27:35,964
Oh, my God.

1075
01:27:58,055 --> 01:28:01,957
- Floor show. Floor show.
- Go on.

1076
01:28:02,126 --> 01:28:04,492
Get y'all gone. We talking business.

1077
01:28:06,063 --> 01:28:10,056
- I need more.
- Okay, just a second. Okay, okay.

1078
01:28:10,234 --> 01:28:12,202
It feels so good.

1079
01:28:13,170 --> 01:28:15,934
That's what I've been looking for.
Thank you very much.

1080
01:28:16,106 --> 01:28:19,872
Guys, have a good time,
enjoy yourselves. This is a party.

1081
01:28:28,051 --> 01:28:33,819
Okay. Get the elevator. Around through
the boardroom and to the left.

1082
01:28:41,532 --> 01:28:43,591
Gotcha!

1083
01:28:46,036 --> 01:28:50,666
- Dick followed me up here.
- Hey, Charlie.

1084
01:28:50,874 --> 01:28:53,069
Dick, boy. Hi.

1085
01:28:56,313 --> 01:29:01,216
- Going down?
- Down, yes. Lobby, please.

1086
01:29:01,385 --> 01:29:04,582
Funny, we're going to the lobby too.

1087
01:29:09,092 --> 01:29:12,926
Well, I guess we can all ride together.

1088
01:29:19,269 --> 01:29:21,533
I don't feel very well.
I think we should go.

1089
01:29:21,705 --> 01:29:24,139
Not until you have one
little drink with Charlie.

1090
01:29:24,308 --> 01:29:27,971
- No, Charlie, I really think...
- Here, let me take your purse.

1091
01:29:29,279 --> 01:29:31,543
One little nightcap.

1092
01:29:48,899 --> 01:29:51,629
Nobility. Pride.

1093
01:29:51,802 --> 01:29:55,465
A sense of feeling that
your life amounts to something.

1094
01:29:55,639 --> 01:29:58,802
That's what we lost when
we lost the space program.

1095
01:29:58,976 --> 01:30:01,035
- Sir?
- Nobil... Nobil...

1096
01:30:01,211 --> 01:30:02,940
- What?
- May I have a word with you?

1097
01:30:03,113 --> 01:30:04,671
- Right now?
- Yes, sir.

1098
01:30:04,848 --> 01:30:08,750
Hey, listen. Don't go away.
I'll be right back.

1099
01:30:09,353 --> 01:30:10,843
Let's go.

1100
01:30:11,021 --> 01:30:13,216
Where? Where are we going?

1101
01:30:21,164 --> 01:30:24,793
- We were just gonna walk right out.
- We were. We were.

1102
01:30:27,004 --> 01:30:30,235
There's nothing to worry about.
Charlie wouldn't call the cops.

1103
01:30:30,407 --> 01:30:33,103
This money doesn't exist.
Don't you understand?

1104
01:30:33,277 --> 01:30:36,610
What about all these security guards?
Do they exist or don't they?

1105
01:30:41,518 --> 01:30:46,285
Wait a minute.
Dick, we gotta call the cops.

1106
01:30:46,456 --> 01:30:48,856
- Are you crazy?
- No, no, I'm not kidding.

1107
01:30:49,026 --> 01:30:51,494
Charlie's never gonna admit
there's a slush fund.

1108
01:30:51,662 --> 01:30:55,564
If he sees cops all around, he's gonna
make sure we get out of here safely.

1109
01:30:55,732 --> 01:30:58,360
With the money.

1110
01:30:59,202 --> 01:31:02,262
You're very smart, Jane.

1111
01:31:04,541 --> 01:31:07,135
- Have you got a dime?
- A dime?

1112
01:31:07,311 --> 01:31:09,472
- Yeah.
- No. You?

1113
01:31:13,550 --> 01:31:17,850
Find someone with change of
1000 dollars, for chrissake.

1114
01:31:29,099 --> 01:31:32,432
- Jane feeling better?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure.

1115
01:31:32,603 --> 01:31:35,333
Dick, there's something
I've been meaning to ask you.

1116
01:31:35,505 --> 01:31:37,268
Shoot.

1117
01:31:37,441 --> 01:31:40,672
What's in the bag?
Your makeup?

1118
01:31:42,546 --> 01:31:44,741
Charlie, Charlie.

1119
01:31:49,019 --> 01:31:50,816
- Charlie, can I level with you?
- Sure.

1120
01:31:50,988 --> 01:31:54,856
- Well, I mean really level with you.
- You can tell me anything.

1121
01:31:55,025 --> 01:31:59,621
We just cleaned out your safe.
Every last buck.

1122
01:32:02,099 --> 01:32:04,499
- Did you now?
- Yeah.

1123
01:32:04,668 --> 01:32:09,002
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said it
straight-out like that.

1124
01:32:09,172 --> 01:32:13,040
But I'm just sick of all the bullshit,
you know what I mean?

1125
01:32:13,210 --> 01:32:15,110
How do you propose
to get out of here?

1126
01:32:15,278 --> 01:32:18,338
- With your help, Charlie.
- My help?

1127
01:32:18,515 --> 01:32:21,177
Do you see that big dude over there?

1128
01:32:21,385 --> 01:32:25,845
He can shoot the eye out
of a hummingbird at 50 paces.

1129
01:32:27,591 --> 01:32:31,391
Charlie, we just called the cops.

1130
01:32:43,407 --> 01:32:46,570
- We're gonna give ourselves up.
- This is no joke, friends.

1131
01:32:46,777 --> 01:32:50,577
- We're gonna make a clean breast of it.
- Don't be stupid.

1132
01:32:50,747 --> 01:32:54,979
You keep your mouth shut,
and I'll see that you get out of here.

1133
01:32:55,152 --> 01:32:56,210
With the money?

1134
01:33:00,924 --> 01:33:03,222
You son of a bitch.

1135
01:33:07,264 --> 01:33:12,861
Officers, I'm Charles Blanchard.
I'm the president of Taft Aerospace.

1136
01:33:13,036 --> 01:33:14,469
Maybe I can be of help.

1137
01:33:15,806 --> 01:33:19,503
Dear, you've just seen a demonstration
of what we in the corporate world...

1138
01:33:19,676 --> 01:33:23,077
...refer to as
"hardballing it with the big guys."

1139
01:33:23,246 --> 01:33:26,010
I enjoyed it thoroughly.

1140
01:33:26,183 --> 01:33:29,346
Would you be embarrassed
if I kissed you in a public place?

1141
01:33:29,519 --> 01:33:32,283
I'd be embarrassed if you kissed me
in a private place...

1142
01:33:32,456 --> 01:33:34,083
...with all these people around.

1143
01:33:35,759 --> 01:33:39,217
I'm afraid, officer, that you've been
a victim of a drunken prankster...

1144
01:33:39,396 --> 01:33:44,766
...but if you'd excuse me for one minute,
this young lady isn't feeling very well.

1145
01:33:44,935 --> 01:33:45,924
I'm sorry.

1146
01:33:46,103 --> 01:33:49,561
If I could get these two out of here,
I'd feel a lot better. Run along.

1147
01:33:49,740 --> 01:33:53,938
Now we can talk about that
ridiculous story about my safe.

1148
01:33:54,311 --> 01:33:57,940
- Jane...
- Come along, Jane. Come along.
