- National Competition on Worries! - National Competition on Worries!

5
00:00:13,325 --> 00:00:15,366
Let me introduce our guests for today.

6
00:00:15,366 --> 00:00:16,495
K.will!

7
00:00:16,866 --> 00:00:17,896
(K.will, autumn ballad singer)

8
00:00:17,896 --> 00:00:19,035
Actor Kang Tae Oh!

9
00:00:19,035 --> 00:00:20,135
(Actor Kang Tae Oh, King Kang Tae Oh)

10
00:00:20,135 --> 00:00:21,335
Kang Nam!

11
00:00:21,335 --> 00:00:22,366
(Kang Nam, the handsome and sweet man)

12
00:00:22,405 --> 00:00:23,535
- Hur Young Ji! - Hur Young Ji!

13
00:00:23,535 --> 00:00:24,565
(Hur Young Ji, an idol singer and an entertainer)

14
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:30,245
When we see him on TV, we know that autumn has come.

15
00:00:30,245 --> 00:00:32,145
- He's in season now. - He's in season.

16
00:00:32,145 --> 00:00:34,715
Why do you think you're popular?

17
00:00:34,715 --> 00:00:36,486
Is that something you should think about that seriously?

18
00:00:38,086 --> 00:00:40,385
I don't know why. I guess I'm just lucky.

19
00:00:40,385 --> 00:00:42,255
- I've been a singer for a while. - He sings so well.

20
00:00:42,255 --> 00:00:43,486
- He sings really well. - That must be why.

21
00:00:43,486 --> 00:00:45,456
Honestly, your looks aren't your selling point, right?

22
00:00:46,156 --> 00:00:47,855
Why would you be so sure about that?

23
00:00:48,825 --> 00:00:50,995
Everyone has his own preference.

24
00:00:51,565 --> 00:00:53,865
People who like this kind of looks go crazy about me.

25
00:00:54,635 --> 00:00:55,736
He's right.

26
00:00:56,105 --> 00:00:58,035
Tae Oh is quite peculiar.

27
00:00:58,035 --> 00:00:59,675
- The last time he was here, - Yes.

28
00:00:59,675 --> 00:01:01,645
he looked so sad while saying he missed his hometown,

29
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:03,975
- but his hometown is Incheon. - Incheon.

30
00:01:04,346 --> 00:01:06,145
Incheon is not far from Seoul.

31
00:01:06,246 --> 00:01:09,016
- His eyes welled up with tears. - That's right.

32
00:01:09,016 --> 00:01:11,386
- I thought he was from Haenam. - Exactly.

33
00:01:11,486 --> 00:01:15,785
If Kang Nam says he misses his hometown, I would understand.

34
00:01:15,785 --> 00:01:16,826
- That would be understandable. - That's right.

35
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:18,456
My mom lives in Yongsan.

36
00:01:19,025 --> 00:01:20,255
(Laughing)

37
00:01:20,725 --> 00:01:22,225
What about your father?

38
00:01:22,225 --> 00:01:23,565
My father visits me often.

39
00:01:23,565 --> 00:01:25,236
He comes to Seoul between 2 and 3 times in 1 month.

40
00:01:25,236 --> 00:01:26,296
- I see. - Yes.

41
00:01:26,466 --> 00:01:27,496
He visits me quite often.

42
00:01:27,496 --> 00:01:29,565
Since you're here, tell us about your worries.

43
00:01:29,565 --> 00:01:31,535
I have thin wrists.

44
00:01:31,535 --> 00:01:33,505
- Thin wrists? - Yes.

45
00:01:33,505 --> 00:01:35,246
- So? - Why is that a worry?

46
00:01:35,246 --> 00:01:36,546
- Let me see. - Do you wish they were thick?

47
00:01:36,546 --> 00:01:37,746
I wish my hands were bigger.

48
00:01:37,746 --> 00:01:40,415
- Is this thick enough for you? - Yes.

49
00:01:40,445 --> 00:01:41,886
I have hang ups about my thick bones.

50
00:01:41,886 --> 00:01:43,785
- You have thick bones. - I wish I had thick bones.

51
00:01:44,285 --> 00:01:45,785
What kind of worry is that?

52
00:01:46,255 --> 00:01:47,686
"I wish I had thick bones."

53
00:01:47,686 --> 00:01:50,626
- I wish I had a smaller head. - This is ridiculous.

54
00:01:50,886 --> 00:01:53,096
I have so many worries about my bones.

55
00:01:53,096 --> 00:01:55,725
- I wish I had a smaller head. - I wish I could be reborn.

56
00:01:56,395 --> 00:01:57,725
Your face is ridiculously small.

57
00:01:59,996 --> 00:02:00,996
Is everything small?

58
00:02:02,136 --> 00:02:04,236
(Laughing)

59
00:02:04,236 --> 00:02:05,275
I didn't mean it like that.

60
00:02:05,736 --> 00:02:08,576
Those people with small hands usually have small feet.

61
00:02:08,576 --> 00:02:10,946
Why did you make that hand gesture?

62
00:02:10,976 --> 00:02:13,375
I meant his head, hands,

63
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:15,145
- and feet. - He asked if your are feet small too.

64
00:02:15,145 --> 00:02:17,215
- Tae Oh, what did you think about? - Exactly.

65
00:02:17,215 --> 00:02:18,685
Tae Oh is weird.

66
00:02:18,685 --> 00:02:20,916
- Your ears are red. - He just asked you a question.

67
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:22,256
- His ears are red. - Look at his ears.

68
00:02:22,256 --> 00:02:23,525
Kang Nam, do you have any worries?

69
00:02:23,525 --> 00:02:26,196
There aren't many things I want to do.

70
00:02:26,196 --> 00:02:28,095
What was that word? Hobby.

71
00:02:28,095 --> 00:02:30,066
- I understand... - Hobby?

72
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:31,425
I don't have any hobby.

73
00:02:31,425 --> 00:02:33,166
- That's not how you pronounce it. - Hobby?

74
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:34,566
- Hobby. - Hobby.

75
00:02:34,566 --> 00:02:36,036
- Hobby. - Is that right?

76
00:02:36,036 --> 00:02:38,405
- Yes. - I have nothing to do in my free time.

77
00:02:39,136 --> 00:02:40,236
You can work without a break.

78
00:02:40,236 --> 00:02:42,175
- A brick? - Without a break.

79
00:02:42,305 --> 00:02:44,506
- If you work restlessly... - Hobby. Without a break.

80
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,486
When someone is overly enthusiastic about his hobby,

81
00:02:49,486 --> 00:02:52,756
his family member sends us his story.

82
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:53,786
(They send us their stories.)

83
00:02:53,786 --> 00:02:55,185
- It's good that you're not. - You should be moderate.

84
00:02:55,185 --> 00:02:56,425
- I see. - Too much enthusiasm isn't good.

85
00:02:56,425 --> 00:02:58,456
Let's see what kind of worries we have today.

86
00:02:58,456 --> 00:02:59,796
Show us the keywords please.

87
00:02:59,796 --> 00:03:01,356
(The keywords are revealed.)

88
00:03:01,796 --> 00:03:03,726
- "A Midlife Crisis Is the Worst". - That's true.

89
00:03:03,726 --> 00:03:04,995
"Do I Look Like an ATM?"

90
00:03:04,995 --> 00:03:06,736
"Oh, Save Me".

91
00:03:07,296 --> 00:03:09,365
The title is "A Midlife Crisis Is the Worst".

92
00:03:09,365 --> 00:03:13,875
Hello. I'm a housewife in my 40s. I've been married for 22 years.

93
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:17,745
I'm going to report my husband who is having a midlife crisis.

94
00:03:17,745 --> 00:03:19,546
- He's in a midlife crisis? - Yes.

95
00:03:19,546 --> 00:03:21,816
It began five years ago.

96
00:03:21,816 --> 00:03:25,055
My husband happened to join a contest.

97
00:03:25,055 --> 00:03:26,185
- A singing contest. - "Did you see my dance?"

98
00:03:26,185 --> 00:03:30,155
"I think I've finally discovered my cheery energy hidden inside of me."

99
00:03:30,185 --> 00:03:31,185
"You saw me, right?"

100
00:03:31,185 --> 00:03:34,095
Since then, my husband got hooked on dancing.

101
00:03:34,095 --> 00:03:35,095
- He got hooked on dancing. - I see.

102
00:03:35,095 --> 00:03:36,166
(I see.)

103
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:38,965
"Honey, look at me. Look at my dazzling steps."

104
00:03:38,965 --> 00:03:41,566
"Look. This is called shuffle dance."

105
00:03:41,566 --> 00:03:43,106
"I came up with a new dance move."

106
00:03:43,106 --> 00:03:44,606
"What do you think?"

107
00:03:44,835 --> 00:03:47,175
To me, it seems just horrible,

108
00:03:47,775 --> 00:03:49,405
and funny.

109
00:03:49,405 --> 00:03:50,745
However, he didn't stop there.

110
00:03:50,745 --> 00:03:52,715
"I heard 'National Singing Contest' will be held in our town."

111
00:03:53,046 --> 00:03:54,175
"Honey, wish me luck."

112
00:03:54,175 --> 00:03:56,845
"Honey, 'National Singing Contest' will be held in our neighboring town."

113
00:03:56,845 --> 00:03:58,085
"See you later."

114
00:03:58,486 --> 00:04:02,786
It's unbelievable that he got hooked on dancing when he's almost 50.

115
00:04:02,786 --> 00:04:05,555
Please help me stop his midlife crisis.

116
00:04:05,555 --> 00:04:07,256
(Please help me stop his midlife crisis!)

117
00:04:07,256 --> 00:04:09,895
She said her husband is almost 50.

118
00:04:09,895 --> 00:04:13,095
You know how hard shuttle dance is, right?

119
00:04:13,095 --> 00:04:14,636
- It's shuffle dance. - Shuffle dance.

120
00:04:14,636 --> 00:04:16,866
- Not shuttle bus. - Shuttle dance should be like this.

121
00:04:17,066 --> 00:04:18,806
- Shuttle dance? - Shuttle dance?

122
00:04:19,335 --> 00:04:20,636
- What kind of dance is it? - Get in the bus now.

123
00:04:21,775 --> 00:04:23,176
Shuttle dance?

124
00:04:23,176 --> 00:04:26,145
Anyway, let's meet with our guest.

125
00:04:26,145 --> 00:04:27,676
Please come out.

126
00:04:27,746 --> 00:04:30,816
(Who is the wife of a man who is hooked on dancing?)

127
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:32,715
(Hesitating)

128
00:04:33,616 --> 00:04:34,655
She's wearing a skirt.

129
00:04:34,655 --> 00:04:35,785
(Come on.)

130
00:04:36,926 --> 00:04:38,395
- Aren't they pants? - Look at her glasses.

131
00:04:38,395 --> 00:04:39,395
(Kim Myung Shim)

132
00:04:41,696 --> 00:04:42,866
(It's nice to meet you.)

133
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:43,895
She chose K.will.

134
00:04:43,895 --> 00:04:44,895
(She chose K.will.)

135
00:04:45,895 --> 00:04:47,295
She greeted Kang Nam.

136
00:04:49,465 --> 00:04:51,366
Why did you hold K.will's hand after greeting Kang Nam?

137
00:04:51,366 --> 00:04:52,436
I felt apologetic to him.

138
00:04:52,436 --> 00:04:54,235
- I'm a big fan of K.will's. - I see.

139
00:04:54,235 --> 00:04:56,176
- She's a fan of K.will's. - I see.

140
00:04:56,176 --> 00:04:57,275
She really is a fan of his.

141
00:04:57,275 --> 00:04:59,215
(I have a lot of fans too.)

142
00:05:00,145 --> 00:05:01,746
Please introduce yourself.

143
00:05:01,746 --> 00:05:05,816
Hello. I'm a housewife from Geumsan, South Chungcheong Province.

144
00:05:06,886 --> 00:05:08,256
(Hello.)

145
00:05:08,525 --> 00:05:11,186
Tell us how your husband got hooked on dancing.

146
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:14,926
Five years ago, he appeared on "Morning Forum"...

147
00:05:14,926 --> 00:05:17,866
as his sister suggested. In the segment...

148
00:05:17,866 --> 00:05:20,095
"Sing with Your Family", he danced on stage.

149
00:05:20,095 --> 00:05:22,165
- "Morning Forum"? - I remember that segment.

150
00:05:22,165 --> 00:05:24,806
Ever since he appeared on that show,

151
00:05:24,806 --> 00:05:27,576
the cheerful energy inside of him burst out.

152
00:05:27,576 --> 00:05:31,876
He became so confident in dancing, so he dances all the time.

153
00:05:31,876 --> 00:05:33,215
He became confident.

154
00:05:33,215 --> 00:05:36,585
An episode of "National Singing Contest" was recorded in Geumsan.

155
00:05:36,585 --> 00:05:39,256
- Did he pass the preliminary round? - Yes, he did.

156
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:40,556
He won the Popularity Award.

157
00:05:40,556 --> 00:05:42,285
He must be good at singing.

158
00:05:42,285 --> 00:05:46,256
I wish he had been satisfied with that, but he didn't stop.

159
00:05:46,256 --> 00:05:48,795
He applied for the contest held in Muju too.

160
00:05:48,826 --> 00:05:50,965
Muju isn't a neighboring town. It's in Jeolla Province.

161
00:05:50,965 --> 00:05:52,996
He went for the audition.

162
00:05:52,996 --> 00:05:55,335
The staff must've recognized my husband.

163
00:05:55,335 --> 00:05:56,366
Of course. He won an award.

164
00:05:56,366 --> 00:05:57,766
How long had it been since the contest in Geumsan?

165
00:05:57,766 --> 00:05:59,436
- It had been one year. - I see.

166
00:05:59,436 --> 00:06:02,746
So they said he could apply for it at least three years after that.

167
00:06:02,746 --> 00:06:04,376
- At least three years after that. - I didn't know that.

168
00:06:04,376 --> 00:06:05,876
- I see. - I didn't know that either.

169
00:06:05,876 --> 00:06:09,415
They sent him home, but he's still waiting for a chance.

170
00:06:09,415 --> 00:06:10,686
- Even now? - Yes.

171
00:06:10,686 --> 00:06:14,386
- What's his profession? - He's a used car salesman,

172
00:06:14,386 --> 00:06:17,826
but I don't even know if he's a salesman or a dancer anymore.

173
00:06:17,826 --> 00:06:19,696
He goes wherever he can let his cheerful energy out.

174
00:06:19,696 --> 00:06:23,266
He performs at regional events and birthday parties.

175
00:06:23,266 --> 00:06:25,235
He goes wherever he can perform.

176
00:06:25,235 --> 00:06:27,496
He's even deluded that he's a celebrity.

177
00:06:27,496 --> 00:06:29,136
Does he not greet other people?

178
00:06:29,136 --> 00:06:31,335
Since his appearance on TV,

179
00:06:31,335 --> 00:06:34,235
whenever people compliment about his performance,

180
00:06:34,235 --> 00:06:36,775
- he becomes more confident. - Of course.

181
00:06:37,076 --> 00:06:38,345
Doesn't he get paid?

182
00:06:38,345 --> 00:06:40,545
If he's invited to events like that,

183
00:06:40,545 --> 00:06:42,516
- he must be paid. - I think so too.

184
00:06:42,516 --> 00:06:45,256
No, he performs without getting paid.

185
00:06:45,256 --> 00:06:46,516
- He doesn't get paid? - That's right.

186
00:06:46,516 --> 00:06:47,516
He doesn't get paid.

187
00:06:48,886 --> 00:06:51,795
Dancing isn't a bad thing. It can enrich his life.

188
00:06:51,795 --> 00:06:53,626
It's not necessarily a bad thing, is it?

189
00:06:53,696 --> 00:06:57,266
I don't mind him enjoying himself, but he forces me to join him.

190
00:06:57,266 --> 00:06:58,595
- He wants you to dance with him. - Yes.

191
00:06:58,595 --> 00:07:02,266
He doesn't even care if I'm doing house chores.

192
00:07:02,266 --> 00:07:05,275
"What do you think? I learned this move today. Is it good?"

193
00:07:05,275 --> 00:07:08,506
That's not all. He dances on the streets or public places.

194
00:07:08,506 --> 00:07:11,576
- He practically dances everywhere. - When we're having a barbecue...

195
00:07:11,876 --> 00:07:16,446
with our relatives chatting with each other,

196
00:07:16,446 --> 00:07:18,956
- He dances in front of them? - he stands up all of a sudden,

197
00:07:18,956 --> 00:07:21,155
and starts dancing after saying "Do you want to see my dance?"

198
00:07:21,155 --> 00:07:23,256
- What do your elders say? - In front of his elders?

199
00:07:23,256 --> 00:07:24,895
They just laugh.

200
00:07:24,895 --> 00:07:26,756
- Right. - "He's good."

201
00:07:27,395 --> 00:07:29,595
Her husband is here. Let's meet him.

202
00:07:29,595 --> 00:07:31,025
Where are you?

203
00:07:32,936 --> 00:07:34,905
- Oh, my. - Look at him.

204
00:07:35,436 --> 00:07:39,105
- He has showmanship. - Goodness.

205
00:07:39,806 --> 00:07:44,376
Sir, you shouldn't do that here. Myung Shim's husband.

206
00:07:44,405 --> 00:07:46,576
Do you understand why your wife is worried?

207
00:07:46,576 --> 00:07:48,516
- No, I can't understand her at all. - Right? I knew you'd say that.

208
00:07:48,516 --> 00:07:49,886
Why can't you understand her?

209
00:07:50,085 --> 00:07:54,085
I just enjoy my hobby. I didn't know she would react like that.

210
00:07:54,155 --> 00:07:55,585
Everyone else likes my performances.

211
00:07:55,585 --> 00:07:58,395
I understand that you want to enjoy yourself,

212
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:01,696
but I don't think you really have to show your wife your dance,

213
00:08:01,696 --> 00:08:04,295
or nag her to dance with you.

214
00:08:04,595 --> 00:08:08,196
I want her to see my dance. I need to dance often...

215
00:08:08,506 --> 00:08:09,706
so I can improve my dance skills.

216
00:08:09,706 --> 00:08:11,165
You want her feedback.

217
00:08:11,206 --> 00:08:13,905
- I want her to review my dance. - In fact,

218
00:08:13,905 --> 00:08:16,306
- Other people give me feedback. - there's something you don't know.

219
00:08:16,605 --> 00:08:19,076
Showing reactions all the time is a very hard thing to do.

220
00:08:19,076 --> 00:08:20,946
- It's not easy at all. - Right.

221
00:08:20,946 --> 00:08:23,246
- She has to show reactions always, - It's hard to do it all the time.

222
00:08:23,246 --> 00:08:27,985
and he may get upset if you sound half-hearted, right?

223
00:08:27,985 --> 00:08:30,025
He gets so angry.

224
00:08:30,155 --> 00:08:32,826
He says that I make him feel like his life is meaningless.

225
00:08:32,826 --> 00:08:34,095
His life is meaningless?

226
00:08:34,095 --> 00:08:36,465
- Did he really say that? - He said he didn't want to be home.

227
00:08:36,465 --> 00:08:38,796
You must've complimented his dance at first, right?

228
00:08:38,796 --> 00:08:40,595
At first, I complimented his dance,

229
00:08:40,595 --> 00:08:42,906
but he repeats the same dance move.

230
00:08:43,735 --> 00:08:45,306
So I don't want to see it anymore.

231
00:08:45,306 --> 00:08:46,306
(I'm tired of it.)

232
00:08:46,406 --> 00:08:49,776
Your wife said your dance is just funny, not great.

233
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,375
What genre is your dance?

234
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:54,885
I learned shuffle dance from videos on the internet.

235
00:08:54,885 --> 00:08:56,585
I mixed different kinds of dance.

236
00:08:56,585 --> 00:08:58,485
- Did you create your own dance? - Yes, I did.

237
00:08:58,485 --> 00:09:01,686
What kind of music do you usually dance to?

238
00:09:01,686 --> 00:09:04,786
I dance to dance, trot, and ballad songs.

239
00:09:04,786 --> 00:09:06,826
- Oh, my. - Ballad songs?

240
00:09:06,826 --> 00:09:10,196
So, you can dance to any kind of music.

241
00:09:10,196 --> 00:09:12,066
- That's amazing. - He must be very talented.

242
00:09:12,066 --> 00:09:13,835
- He sounds like a dancing machine. - Right.

243
00:09:14,696 --> 00:09:16,005
- He's a dancing machine. - He's a dancing machine.

244
00:09:16,005 --> 00:09:18,776
Can you dance to K.will's sad ballad songs too?

245
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:20,406
Yes, I can.

246
00:09:21,206 --> 00:09:23,406
- I want to see that. - It's because...

247
00:09:23,406 --> 00:09:25,875
- shuffle dance is very... - It's difficult.

248
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,076
- It's difficult. - The steps are difficult.

249
00:09:27,076 --> 00:09:28,885
You all know T-ara's dance...

250
00:09:28,885 --> 00:09:31,585
for their song "Lovey-Dovey", right?

251
00:09:31,585 --> 00:09:33,585
- I know that. - I'll show you.

252
00:09:33,585 --> 00:09:34,715
- Show us. - Come on out.

253
00:09:34,715 --> 00:09:35,826
You mentioned that because you wanted to dance, right?

254
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:37,326
It looks a bit weird.

255
00:09:38,255 --> 00:09:39,725
- That's good. - This is how they dance.

256
00:09:39,725 --> 00:09:42,066
- This is shuffle dance. - How close will you get to me?

257
00:09:43,965 --> 00:09:45,495
You stood in the center like a lead dancer of a group.

258
00:09:45,495 --> 00:09:50,036
We'd like to see his dance. Can you allow him just for today?

259
00:09:50,365 --> 00:09:51,706
- Look how she's sighing. - Right.

260
00:09:51,706 --> 00:09:53,806
She's worried that he may be even more enthusiastic about dance.

261
00:09:53,806 --> 00:09:55,005
- Exactly. - She must be worried.

262
00:09:55,005 --> 00:09:57,576
- If we see his dance... - We'll know how good he is.

263
00:09:57,576 --> 00:09:59,916
Let's find out if his dance is as horrible as his wife said,

264
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:02,245
or if he's an excellent dancer who has the talent.

265
00:10:02,245 --> 00:10:03,485
- Right. - Please come out.

266
00:10:03,485 --> 00:10:05,085
How should I react to that?

267
00:10:08,956 --> 00:10:10,855
Please stand up, guys.

268
00:10:10,885 --> 00:10:12,796
Let's stand around him while he's dancing.

269
00:10:18,995 --> 00:10:21,166
(If you have lips, pout them.)

270
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:23,206
- Look at him. - Oh, my.

271
00:10:25,505 --> 00:10:28,276
(He moves his body awkwardly.)

272
00:10:28,276 --> 00:10:29,276
Goodness.

273
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:35,186
- He knows how to do this dance. - That's impressive.

274
00:10:35,186 --> 00:10:36,186
(Dancing awkwardly)

275
00:10:38,816 --> 00:10:40,515
That's new.

276
00:10:41,456 --> 00:10:42,485
That's amazing.

277
00:10:46,156 --> 00:10:47,495
(She's the only one who isn't laughing.)

278
00:10:49,826 --> 00:10:50,865
Okay. It's time.

279
00:10:51,835 --> 00:10:53,796
- How about K.will's song? - That would be great.

280
00:10:53,896 --> 00:10:54,906
"Missing You".

281
00:10:57,105 --> 00:10:58,306
He'll dance to this song?

282
00:11:01,806 --> 00:11:02,906
He'll dance to this song?

283
00:11:07,546 --> 00:11:08,546
Look at him.

284
00:11:10,715 --> 00:11:12,585
- That's impressive. - Take a full body shot.

285
00:11:12,585 --> 00:11:13,585
My goodness.

286
00:11:13,585 --> 00:11:14,585
(Oh, my eyes.)

287
00:11:16,585 --> 00:11:17,585
Oh, boy.

288
00:11:17,725 --> 00:11:19,326
Look at K.will's face.

289
00:11:21,026 --> 00:11:22,526
- Look at his face. - Dance without music.

290
00:11:22,526 --> 00:11:24,296
Look at K.will's face.

291
00:11:24,296 --> 00:11:25,595
- How do you feel? - Sorry?

292
00:11:25,595 --> 00:11:27,765
- How do you feel? - I wished my song would stop.

293
00:11:28,196 --> 00:11:30,166
- Please dance without music now. - Dance without music.

294
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:31,166
Ready. Go.

295
00:11:31,406 --> 00:11:33,605
- I was immature - Without music.

296
00:11:33,635 --> 00:11:35,446
- He's singing... - He's tired.

297
00:11:36,776 --> 00:11:40,146
(The dancing machine is already tired.)

298
00:11:40,146 --> 00:11:42,245
Gosh. That must've been tiring.

299
00:11:42,245 --> 00:11:44,215
- He's exhausted. - I'm okay.

300
00:11:45,385 --> 00:11:46,985
- Sir. - He looks like he's going to faint.

301
00:11:46,985 --> 00:11:48,826
I was too immature

302
00:11:49,826 --> 00:11:51,725
When I was in love with you

303
00:11:51,725 --> 00:11:53,095
(He looks so serious.)

304
00:11:53,095 --> 00:11:55,926
May our love

305
00:11:56,196 --> 00:11:58,335
Be fragrant forever

306
00:11:59,196 --> 00:12:01,135
Please give him a round of applause.

307
00:12:01,806 --> 00:12:03,536
- He's amazing. - He is, indeed.

308
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,576
(His wife feels like she's an island.)

309
00:12:07,176 --> 00:12:10,046
How did you feel watching him dancing in front of many people?

310
00:12:10,306 --> 00:12:12,615
I'm embarrassed. I'm so ashamed.

311
00:12:12,615 --> 00:12:15,985
Imagine that he dances like that on the street.

312
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,245
- She must be embarrassed. - How embarrassed she must be.

313
00:12:17,245 --> 00:12:18,916
Do you dance like that in public places?

314
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:22,456
As long as I get invited to events, I don't care where I perform.

315
00:12:22,985 --> 00:12:24,085
What is the reason?

316
00:12:24,286 --> 00:12:25,696
My father...

317
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:29,396
has always dreamed of appearing on "National Singing Contest".

318
00:12:29,396 --> 00:12:30,595
- Your father? - I see.

319
00:12:30,595 --> 00:12:32,235
- Your father has. - Yes.

320
00:12:32,696 --> 00:12:35,265
I wanted to make his dream come true,

321
00:12:35,265 --> 00:12:37,566
and I tried to achieve even more than that.

322
00:12:37,566 --> 00:12:39,176
As I won an award, I came to want more.

323
00:12:39,505 --> 00:12:41,845
- When you turn 60... - Your wife said...

324
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:45,345
that you're deluded that you're a celebrity.

325
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:46,776
- Is that true? - I think it's true.

326
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:48,146
- He thinks it's true. - He admitted it.

327
00:12:48,146 --> 00:12:49,715
- I think it's true too. - People usually deny the problem.

328
00:12:49,715 --> 00:12:51,816
Could you elaborate further?

329
00:12:51,816 --> 00:12:55,056
Ever since my appearance on the show, people...

330
00:12:55,056 --> 00:12:57,625
Do you mean "Morning Forum" or "National Singing Contest"?

331
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:00,125
- I meant both. - I see.

332
00:13:04,365 --> 00:13:05,495
(He's immersed in the moment.)

333
00:13:09,436 --> 00:13:12,276
(He's in the trance.)

334
00:13:13,206 --> 00:13:16,375
People recognized me from the show for a while.

335
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:18,105
As I heard them compliment...

336
00:13:18,546 --> 00:13:20,776
my performance, I became more confident.

337
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:22,485
So I learned and practiced more.

338
00:13:22,485 --> 00:13:24,446
Then, you must be very excited to be here.

339
00:13:24,485 --> 00:13:26,115
I'm so happy to be here.

340
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:28,056
- I can see that. - Are you happy?

341
00:13:28,056 --> 00:13:29,085
Yes.

342
00:13:30,656 --> 00:13:35,326
Does dancing affect your work negatively, by any chance?

343
00:13:35,595 --> 00:13:38,796
I'm sure that it has a negative effect.

344
00:13:38,796 --> 00:13:40,495
Has anyone bought a car because he recognized you?

345
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:42,566
- Yes. - Is that so?

346
00:13:42,566 --> 00:13:44,605
- Then it had a positive effect. - It was helpful.

347
00:13:44,605 --> 00:13:46,436
When it's time for his gig,

348
00:13:46,436 --> 00:13:49,776
- Yes. - he doesn't answer his phone.

349
00:13:50,646 --> 00:13:52,416
- It has a negative effect. - He doesn't answer his phone,

350
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:53,916
and cancels his meetings with his clients.

351
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,245
So it's been affecting his business negatively.

352
00:13:56,245 --> 00:13:58,855
- It caused him a loss too. - I see.

353
00:13:58,885 --> 00:14:01,656
- He doesn't get paid for his gigs. - That's right.

354
00:14:01,786 --> 00:14:05,826
He even buys everyone a drink at the after party.

355
00:14:05,826 --> 00:14:06,995
(He pays the bills at the after party.)

356
00:14:06,995 --> 00:14:08,796
- He attends the after party too? - Yes.

357
00:14:11,365 --> 00:14:12,635
He pays for his gigs.

358
00:14:12,635 --> 00:14:14,365
- Exactly. - Exactly. Also,

359
00:14:14,365 --> 00:14:17,406
because he attends many events, he drinks six times a week.

360
00:14:17,406 --> 00:14:20,706
- My goodness. - He doesn't come home early.

361
00:14:20,706 --> 00:14:22,745
- Why do you drink so much? - What does drinking have to do...

362
00:14:22,745 --> 00:14:24,306
- with dancing? - It's because I can't refuse.

363
00:14:24,306 --> 00:14:26,146
Myung Shim, please tell us.

364
00:14:26,176 --> 00:14:28,515
- He organizes meetings like that. - He asks others to drink with him.

365
00:14:28,515 --> 00:14:29,985
- To show them his dance? - Yes.

366
00:14:30,316 --> 00:14:33,686
He gets excited while dancing, so he drinks.

367
00:14:33,686 --> 00:14:35,456
The drink makes him excited, so he dances again.

368
00:14:35,456 --> 00:14:36,526
I understand.

369
00:14:36,526 --> 00:14:37,725
(That's how the infinite loop of drinking and dancing is formed.)

370
00:14:38,355 --> 00:14:40,656
Do you really perform at events without getting paid?

371
00:14:40,956 --> 00:14:41,995
Yes, I do.

372
00:14:42,595 --> 00:14:43,995
They can buy a car from me instead.

373
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:45,396
I think it's part of my business.

374
00:14:45,396 --> 00:14:46,635
That's not what your wife said.

375
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:50,566
She said you went to practice dancing even when you have...

376
00:14:50,566 --> 00:14:51,706
a meeting with a client.

377
00:14:51,706 --> 00:14:54,076
That was when I was learning to dance.

378
00:14:54,076 --> 00:14:57,776
I learned to dance from a dance tutor.

379
00:14:58,676 --> 00:15:01,416
- My lesson time... - You learned...

380
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:03,416
- My goodness. - You learned to dance?

381
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:05,255
- Yes. - How long did you learn from him?

382
00:15:05,786 --> 00:15:07,085
For about six months.

383
00:15:07,085 --> 00:15:08,956
- You learned for six months? - Yes.

384
00:15:08,956 --> 00:15:10,125
- We thought... - He can't be here.

385
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,896
- Your tutor is not here, right? - That's right.

386
00:15:11,896 --> 00:15:12,995
There's a reason he couldn't come on the show.

387
00:15:13,456 --> 00:15:14,826
(I see.)

388
00:15:14,826 --> 00:15:16,725
- So... - He must be embarrassed.

389
00:15:18,066 --> 00:15:19,835
Could you tell us how it happened?

390
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:21,706
How did you lose a client because of your dance lesson?

391
00:15:21,706 --> 00:15:24,436
When I was scheduled to meet a client at my dance lesson time,

392
00:15:24,975 --> 00:15:27,605
I chose to delay the meeting with my client.

393
00:15:27,605 --> 00:15:29,105
(You delayed a meeting with your client to practice dancing?)

394
00:15:29,406 --> 00:15:31,816
When you call a car dealer to buy a car,

395
00:15:31,816 --> 00:15:34,885
- and the dealer says he's busy, - Right.

396
00:15:34,885 --> 00:15:36,385
- who would buy a car from him? - Exactly.

397
00:15:36,385 --> 00:15:37,845
- You wouldn't buy a car from him. - That's right.

398
00:15:39,115 --> 00:15:41,985
- That's right. - How much longer will you dance?

399
00:15:41,985 --> 00:15:43,286
What's your plan?

400
00:15:43,326 --> 00:15:46,826
Until I release my song album.

401
00:15:47,495 --> 00:15:49,026
- A song album? - Yes.

402
00:15:49,066 --> 00:15:50,396
- Until he releases an album? - A song album?

403
00:15:50,396 --> 00:15:51,735
Do you sing well too?

404
00:15:52,265 --> 00:15:54,095
- You'll release an album? - I've been learning to sing.

405
00:15:54,095 --> 00:15:55,666
- He's learning to sing. - You just started to learn to sing?

406
00:15:55,706 --> 00:15:59,605
If I get lucky and get a good song, I could earn a lot of money too.

407
00:15:59,806 --> 00:16:00,806
You can get paid for your gigs.

408
00:16:00,806 --> 00:16:02,005
Yes, I'll perform at events.

409
00:16:02,005 --> 00:16:03,676
Then, will it be your day job?

410
00:16:04,245 --> 00:16:06,576
It can be my backup plan for my later years.

411
00:16:06,576 --> 00:16:08,046
- For your later years? - Your backup plan?

412
00:16:08,046 --> 00:16:09,885
You're going to dance to prepare for your retirement?

413
00:16:10,446 --> 00:16:11,885
He's quite determined.

414
00:16:11,885 --> 00:16:14,956
We just heard his future plan. Did you know about this?

415
00:16:15,056 --> 00:16:17,686
I do know that, but we have three kids.

416
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:19,625
Our youngest child is only seven.

417
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:21,196
- He's very young. - He's only seven years old.

418
00:16:21,196 --> 00:16:23,265
My daughters are 21...

419
00:16:23,265 --> 00:16:25,465
- and 18 years old. - Her kids have a big age gap.

420
00:16:25,465 --> 00:16:26,796
They have a lot of problems with their dad.

421
00:16:26,896 --> 00:16:28,095
- Which one of them is here? - Is he her youngest child?

422
00:16:28,095 --> 00:16:29,835
My eldest daughter came here with me.

423
00:16:29,835 --> 00:16:31,465
- Oh, she's Myung Shim's daughter. - She looks upset.

424
00:16:31,465 --> 00:16:33,605
Let's meet with Myung Shim's eldest daughter. Hello.

425
00:16:33,605 --> 00:16:34,946
Hello.

426
00:16:35,706 --> 00:16:36,706
(Hello)

427
00:16:37,306 --> 00:16:40,375
Do you understand your mom or your dad more?

428
00:16:40,446 --> 00:16:42,385
I understand my mom's worries.

429
00:16:42,786 --> 00:16:44,786
Why? Why do you understand her?

430
00:16:44,786 --> 00:16:49,585
At first, I thought it'd be okay if Dad enjoys his hobby,

431
00:16:49,585 --> 00:16:52,056
but things got worse and worse.

432
00:16:52,056 --> 00:16:53,125
To me,

433
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:55,995
it just seems like his steps are a bit flashy.

434
00:16:56,196 --> 00:16:57,365
Flashy steps?

435
00:16:57,365 --> 00:16:59,995
But he thinks his dance skills are good.

436
00:16:59,995 --> 00:17:01,365
Also,

437
00:17:01,365 --> 00:17:04,866
I work as a nurse's aide in three shifts.

438
00:17:04,866 --> 00:17:06,475
- That sounds tough. - My dad keeps...

439
00:17:06,475 --> 00:17:09,775
asking me to edit or download dance videos.

440
00:17:09,775 --> 00:17:12,015
It's just too much.

441
00:17:12,075 --> 00:17:15,745
What do you think is troubling your mom the most?

442
00:17:15,745 --> 00:17:18,886
Before, they used to divide house chores.

443
00:17:18,886 --> 00:17:20,785
Since my dad took up dancing,

444
00:17:20,785 --> 00:17:22,725
he's been staying out too much.

445
00:17:22,725 --> 00:17:25,755
All the chores are done by my mom now.

446
00:17:25,755 --> 00:17:28,926
Dad relieves his stress by dancing,

447
00:17:28,926 --> 00:17:31,325
but Mom has to stay home all the time.

448
00:17:31,325 --> 00:17:32,995
I think that troubles her the most.

449
00:17:32,995 --> 00:17:35,505
Have you ever tried to persuade your dad to stop?

450
00:17:35,505 --> 00:17:37,035
Yes, but it didn't work.

451
00:17:37,136 --> 00:17:39,376
He must have helped you out a lot before.

452
00:17:39,376 --> 00:17:41,775
Yes, he did.

453
00:17:41,775 --> 00:17:44,916
We used to go on many trips as well.

454
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:49,015
There are house chores that can only be done by men.

455
00:17:49,015 --> 00:17:51,686
He says I should hire someone...

456
00:17:51,686 --> 00:17:52,815
and leaves home.

457
00:17:52,815 --> 00:17:54,416
- To go dancing? - Yes.

458
00:17:55,025 --> 00:17:58,596
As we live in the countryside,

459
00:17:58,596 --> 00:18:01,156
there's no big hospital nearby.

460
00:18:04,225 --> 00:18:06,096
- It's okay. - Was there a problem?

461
00:18:06,096 --> 00:18:07,795
(She suddenly sighs.)

462
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,666
- She must be very worried. - She's upset.

463
00:18:11,975 --> 00:18:14,475
When kids get sick, their dad should drive them to the hospital.

464
00:18:15,305 --> 00:18:16,876
He probably couldn't.

465
00:18:17,545 --> 00:18:20,315
My in-laws were visiting.

466
00:18:20,545 --> 00:18:22,245
- You mean his parents. - Yes.

467
00:18:22,245 --> 00:18:25,116
My father-in-law...

468
00:18:25,116 --> 00:18:27,285
dislocated our kid's arm by mistake.

469
00:18:27,386 --> 00:18:28,586
It got dislocated?

470
00:18:28,586 --> 00:18:29,586
(Their kid's arm got dislocated.)

471
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,456
It was night.

472
00:18:32,025 --> 00:18:35,426
All clinics were closed. So I called my husband.

473
00:18:35,426 --> 00:18:36,965
(She called her husband.)

474
00:18:36,965 --> 00:18:38,025
- You called him. - Yes.

475
00:18:38,025 --> 00:18:40,235
He said he'd come soon, but he never seemed to come.

476
00:18:40,235 --> 00:18:41,495
(Her husband didn't come.)

477
00:18:42,235 --> 00:18:46,305
So I had to drive the crying kid...

478
00:18:46,305 --> 00:18:47,936
- to the hospital. - That must have hurt.

479
00:18:47,936 --> 00:18:49,646
When did your husband come?

480
00:18:49,646 --> 00:18:51,975
Very late.

481
00:18:51,975 --> 00:18:54,715
Were you drinking...

482
00:18:54,715 --> 00:18:57,745
and dancing with people?

483
00:18:57,745 --> 00:19:00,485
- I was drinking. - Tell us the truth.

484
00:19:00,485 --> 00:19:02,386
I was with someone.

485
00:19:02,386 --> 00:19:04,586
I drank too much.

486
00:19:05,126 --> 00:19:06,456
(He's been neglecting his family.)

487
00:19:07,096 --> 00:19:10,596
Your role is important.

488
00:19:10,596 --> 00:19:11,866
Your son is seven years old now.

489
00:19:11,866 --> 00:19:15,235
At home, I try to spend a lot of time with him.

490
00:19:15,235 --> 00:19:17,406
I dance with him.

491
00:19:17,535 --> 00:19:18,606
Dance?

492
00:19:19,676 --> 00:19:21,235
Does he like it?

493
00:19:21,775 --> 00:19:23,906
I like it.

494
00:19:24,005 --> 00:19:26,245
- What about the kid? - What about the kid?

495
00:19:26,245 --> 00:19:27,876
Does your son like it?

496
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:29,116
He does.

497
00:19:29,446 --> 00:19:31,186
He likes it too.

498
00:19:31,186 --> 00:19:32,485
- I mean... - Do you think...

499
00:19:32,485 --> 00:19:35,025
your son likes to dance with his dad?

500
00:19:35,025 --> 00:19:38,295
- As long as there's music, - He's too young.

501
00:19:38,295 --> 00:19:40,926
- he enjoys himself. - He just mimics his dad.

502
00:19:40,926 --> 00:19:43,825
But my husband dances with him too often.

503
00:19:43,825 --> 00:19:46,336
When I see them dance together,

504
00:19:46,336 --> 00:19:49,136
I see my husband in my son.

505
00:19:49,136 --> 00:19:51,206
I hate it.

506
00:19:53,475 --> 00:19:56,676
Your son goes to daycare center. His dad must be invited to the class.

507
00:19:56,676 --> 00:19:59,916
Yes. He was invited the other day.

508
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:02,545
Instead of introducing himself normally,

509
00:20:02,545 --> 00:20:03,886
- No way. - he...

510
00:20:03,886 --> 00:20:05,686
- In the class? - No way.

511
00:20:05,686 --> 00:20:07,985
- No way. - He danced...

512
00:20:07,985 --> 00:20:11,356
when it was his turn to introduce himself. I was so embarrassed.

513
00:20:11,696 --> 00:20:13,825
I'd love to see it.

514
00:20:13,825 --> 00:20:14,856
What did you do?

515
00:20:15,025 --> 00:20:16,366
It's your turn.

516
00:20:18,596 --> 00:20:20,535
Hello, I'm Geumsan's Psy.

517
00:20:20,765 --> 00:20:22,235
Oh, like that.

518
00:20:22,336 --> 00:20:23,706
His steps are flashy.

519
00:20:24,366 --> 00:20:27,106
Did the teacher say anything?

520
00:20:27,106 --> 00:20:30,075
I didn't hear anything directly,

521
00:20:30,075 --> 00:20:32,075
but my husband bragged about it.

522
00:20:32,176 --> 00:20:34,575
I see.

523
00:20:34,575 --> 00:20:37,346
Let's hear from their son.

524
00:20:37,346 --> 00:20:38,515
- I'd love to hear from him. - What's his name?

525
00:20:39,156 --> 00:20:40,616
- Tae Gyun. - He's so cute.

526
00:20:40,616 --> 00:20:42,586
Tae Gyun. Say something.

527
00:20:42,586 --> 00:20:44,025
- Tae Gyun. - Is your name Tae Gyun?

528
00:20:44,025 --> 00:20:46,055
- Is his name Tae Gyun? - Kim Tae Gyun.

529
00:20:46,055 --> 00:20:47,725
- Kim Tae Gyun? - Even his last name is Kim.

530
00:20:47,725 --> 00:20:49,426
Hi, Tae Gyun.

531
00:20:50,626 --> 00:20:53,436
- Hello. - He's so cute.

532
00:20:53,436 --> 00:20:55,206
Say hi to Tae Gyun.

533
00:20:55,206 --> 00:20:57,035
I'm Kim Tae Gyun. What's your name?

534
00:20:58,136 --> 00:20:59,575
I'm Kim Tae Gyun.

535
00:21:00,535 --> 00:21:03,505
- He's so cute. - Make a conversation.

536
00:21:03,505 --> 00:21:06,376
What do you think when your dad dances?

537
00:21:06,376 --> 00:21:07,475
I like it.

538
00:21:07,946 --> 00:21:10,015
- Is he a good dancer? - Yes.

539
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:12,656
- Are you a good dancer too? - Yes.

540
00:21:12,956 --> 00:21:14,886
- Can you show us? - Yes.

541
00:21:17,555 --> 00:21:19,426
- Well... - Tae Gyun, let's have some fun.

542
00:21:19,626 --> 00:21:21,196
Is it okay without any music?

543
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:23,096
- Do you want some music? - Come here.

544
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:24,626
He's putting on sunglasses.

545
00:21:25,436 --> 00:21:26,565
Look at him.

546
00:21:26,565 --> 00:21:27,795
- Come here. - He's coming here.

547
00:21:27,795 --> 00:21:29,366
- Do you want to come here? - Come here.

548
00:21:29,366 --> 00:21:30,936
- Come closer. - Come closer.

549
00:21:30,936 --> 00:21:32,936
- Come a bit closer. - There you go.

550
00:21:33,136 --> 00:21:34,436
(The kid looks comfortable.)

551
00:21:34,436 --> 00:21:35,775
Play some music.

552
00:21:44,985 --> 00:21:46,215
(She's not smiling.)

553
00:21:55,096 --> 00:21:56,495
(Thank you.)

554
00:21:56,495 --> 00:21:58,765
- He's so cute. - Good job.

555
00:21:58,765 --> 00:22:00,995
Moms usually smile when their son dances.

556
00:22:00,995 --> 00:22:03,465
- Why didn't you smile? - She didn't smile once.

557
00:22:03,465 --> 00:22:04,535
You look so stiff.

558
00:22:04,535 --> 00:22:05,606
She hates to see it.

559
00:22:05,606 --> 00:22:07,535
- Do you hate it? - Yes.

560
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:10,206
It seems like his dad made him practice.

561
00:22:10,206 --> 00:22:12,916
When the kid was dancing,

562
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:14,475
he wasn't looking at the audience.

563
00:22:14,475 --> 00:22:15,916
- He was looking at his dad. - He was looking at his dad.

564
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:17,015
They must have practiced together.

565
00:22:17,015 --> 00:22:19,156
- It breaks my heart. - She hates to see it.

566
00:22:22,586 --> 00:22:25,995
Your husband looks so happy when he dances.

567
00:22:25,995 --> 00:22:27,956
He usually looks stiff,

568
00:22:27,956 --> 00:22:29,295
but he smiles when we talk about dancing.

569
00:22:29,295 --> 00:22:30,366
Dance.

570
00:22:31,196 --> 00:22:33,035
He looks so happy.

571
00:22:33,035 --> 00:22:36,166
Can't you be more patient?

572
00:22:36,436 --> 00:22:40,775
I wouldn't care if he dances as a hobby.

573
00:22:40,775 --> 00:22:44,305
- But there's a problem. - What is it?

574
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:46,416
Because he dances too hard,

575
00:22:46,416 --> 00:22:48,245
it's been affecting his body.

576
00:22:48,245 --> 00:22:50,146
At first, he pulled a ligament in his knees.

577
00:22:50,146 --> 00:22:51,555
- In his knees? - Yes.

578
00:22:51,555 --> 00:22:53,815
After that,

579
00:22:53,815 --> 00:22:58,325
- he cracked his bone. - He cracked his bone?

580
00:22:58,325 --> 00:22:59,825
- How? - While dancing?

581
00:22:59,825 --> 00:23:02,765
- He must have danced so hard. - He was hospitalized.

582
00:23:02,765 --> 00:23:04,126
In the end,

583
00:23:04,126 --> 00:23:08,436
his ligament got ruptured.

584
00:23:09,336 --> 00:23:12,336
His bones got damaged.

585
00:23:12,336 --> 00:23:14,805
He even went through serious surgery.

586
00:23:14,805 --> 00:23:18,975
He was hospitalized for three months.

587
00:23:18,975 --> 00:23:22,015
He went through three months of rehabilitation.

588
00:23:22,015 --> 00:23:23,346
After that...

589
00:23:23,346 --> 00:23:24,956
It's not like he's a professional dancer.

590
00:23:24,956 --> 00:23:26,886
- After that, - He must have needed rest.

591
00:23:26,886 --> 00:23:30,485
he started dancing again as soon as he was feeling better.

592
00:23:30,485 --> 00:23:34,096
I can imagine how hard he must have tried to recover.

593
00:23:34,096 --> 00:23:35,126
He must have wanted to recover so badly.

594
00:23:35,126 --> 00:23:36,166
(It was a hard time.)

595
00:23:36,426 --> 00:23:38,126
- How did you live? - At that time,

596
00:23:38,126 --> 00:23:40,295
- How old was Tae Gyun? - our son was two years old.

597
00:23:40,295 --> 00:23:42,706
I had to carry him on my back,

598
00:23:42,706 --> 00:23:44,936
going back and forth between the hospital and home.

599
00:23:44,936 --> 00:23:46,575
- That must have been tough. - You had to look after him.

600
00:23:46,575 --> 00:23:48,906
- Yes. - How did you cope financially?

601
00:23:48,906 --> 00:23:50,505
Living expenses and stuff.

602
00:23:50,505 --> 00:23:52,815
We were in debt.

603
00:23:52,815 --> 00:23:54,176
(They were in debt.)

604
00:23:54,376 --> 00:23:56,616
Have you paid off your debt?

605
00:23:57,146 --> 00:23:59,255
Pretty much.

606
00:23:59,755 --> 00:24:02,656
- My in-laws helped us out. - She's been...

607
00:24:02,656 --> 00:24:04,956
crying the whole time.

608
00:24:05,356 --> 00:24:06,426
She must have been holding it back.

609
00:24:06,426 --> 00:24:08,465
You're so irresponsible.

610
00:24:08,465 --> 00:24:11,196
You don't seem to understand the situation.

611
00:24:11,196 --> 00:24:15,035
I'm having a hard time trying to understand you.

612
00:24:15,035 --> 00:24:18,035
You're not doing your job well because you dance too much,

613
00:24:18,035 --> 00:24:21,005
and you're hanging out with people too much.

614
00:24:21,005 --> 00:24:22,646
Isn't it problematic?

615
00:24:22,646 --> 00:24:24,075
You even hurt yourself.

616
00:24:26,315 --> 00:24:27,975
I do feel bad for my wife.

617
00:24:27,975 --> 00:24:30,315
We have two daughters and a son together.

618
00:24:30,315 --> 00:24:33,255
I want to show them that they should never give up...

619
00:24:33,255 --> 00:24:34,886
- pursuing their dreams. - Hold on.

620
00:24:34,886 --> 00:24:36,485
- There are things to look after. - What is your goal?

621
00:24:36,485 --> 00:24:39,755
It seems like you have a bigger goal.

622
00:24:39,755 --> 00:24:42,626
You can release an album any time you want.

623
00:24:42,626 --> 00:24:44,265
Cultwo can help you.

624
00:24:44,265 --> 00:24:46,936
If all you want is to release an album.

625
00:24:46,936 --> 00:24:48,196
What are you talking about?

626
00:24:49,666 --> 00:24:51,336
Dong Yeob will help you.

627
00:24:51,775 --> 00:24:53,136
Seriously,

628
00:24:53,136 --> 00:24:56,275
dancing shouldn't damage the rest of your life.

629
00:24:56,275 --> 00:24:58,206
- You have your job. - In my opinion,

630
00:24:58,206 --> 00:24:59,846
he's not being honest.

631
00:24:59,846 --> 00:25:01,846
He must be a bit embarrassed.

632
00:25:01,846 --> 00:25:05,686
I think what he really wants is to become famous.

633
00:25:06,086 --> 00:25:08,555
He wants people to recognize him.

634
00:25:08,555 --> 00:25:12,926
He's so happy when people recognize him.

635
00:25:12,926 --> 00:25:15,325
He wants to become famous. Am I right?

636
00:25:15,325 --> 00:25:17,896
- Yes, you're right. - He wants to become a celebrity.

637
00:25:17,896 --> 00:25:21,196
Who would pay to see you dance? That's absurd.

638
00:25:21,196 --> 00:25:23,565
Will your dream come true if you work hard?

639
00:25:23,565 --> 00:25:26,206
Will you become famous? Will you get paid to perform?

640
00:25:26,206 --> 00:25:29,206
The chance is lower than 0.01 percent.

641
00:25:29,206 --> 00:25:32,015
- It's zero percent. - It won't happen.

642
00:25:32,015 --> 00:25:35,515
I think I should be blunt for you to understand.

643
00:25:35,515 --> 00:25:37,446
That's why I'm being blunt.

644
00:25:37,446 --> 00:25:39,386
There's a zero-percent chance.

645
00:25:39,386 --> 00:25:42,525
They don't normally get this worked up.

646
00:25:42,525 --> 00:25:43,926
I've never seen them so upset.

647
00:25:43,926 --> 00:25:45,856
- It's because... - I don't understand.

648
00:25:45,856 --> 00:25:48,795
They must have had a bad day.

649
00:25:48,795 --> 00:25:50,265
They're so upset.

650
00:25:50,265 --> 00:25:51,866
Let me guess why.

651
00:25:51,866 --> 00:25:53,295
They thought you were doing it as a hobby,

652
00:25:53,295 --> 00:25:55,336
but then you were dreaming of becoming a professional dancer.

653
00:25:55,336 --> 00:25:57,005
- That's what... - You're right.

654
00:25:57,005 --> 00:25:58,136
- shocked... - That's accurate.

655
00:25:58,136 --> 00:25:59,475
these guys.

656
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:02,475
As your wife is aware of it, she's so shocked.

657
00:26:02,475 --> 00:26:03,475
Of course.

658
00:26:03,475 --> 00:26:05,116
She's been crying the whole time.

659
00:26:05,116 --> 00:26:08,785
Do you know what your wife's dream is?

660
00:26:09,086 --> 00:26:10,346
I'm not sure.

661
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:13,815
Let me ask her. You'll hear it for the first time.

662
00:26:13,815 --> 00:26:15,525
Did you have a dream?

663
00:26:15,956 --> 00:26:18,295
- Of course. - What was it?

664
00:26:18,295 --> 00:26:21,096
I got married kind of early.

665
00:26:21,096 --> 00:26:25,795
I used to have many dreams.

666
00:26:26,096 --> 00:26:31,065
Right now, I'd love to become a barista or a cook.

667
00:26:31,065 --> 00:26:33,235
That's not impossible.

668
00:26:33,235 --> 00:26:36,475
- If you start now... - It'll bring them money too.

669
00:26:36,545 --> 00:26:38,575
Let's say she gets a barista certificate.

670
00:26:38,575 --> 00:26:42,346
Would you be happy if she opens a cafe?

671
00:26:42,586 --> 00:26:44,116
- Let me ask you. - Would you support her?

672
00:26:44,116 --> 00:26:45,755
- I'd be happy. - You would?

673
00:26:45,755 --> 00:26:48,285
Her cafe is doing great. But then she takes up dancing.

674
00:26:48,285 --> 00:26:49,856
(I'll become a dancer instead.)

675
00:26:50,156 --> 00:26:52,156
She's neglecting her business.

676
00:26:52,325 --> 00:26:54,755
She says it's her goal to become a member of a girl group.

677
00:26:55,396 --> 00:26:57,025
- What do you think about that? - That's perfect.

678
00:26:57,025 --> 00:26:59,936
- That's a perfect analogy. - What do you think about that?

679
00:26:59,936 --> 00:27:02,035
What do you think about that? Tell us.

680
00:27:02,136 --> 00:27:04,366
If you put it that way, I understand how she feels.

681
00:27:04,366 --> 00:27:05,936
- That's exactly what you are doing. - That's right.

682
00:27:05,936 --> 00:27:08,575
You saw her legs, right? When you came down the slide,

683
00:27:08,575 --> 00:27:10,975
I saw that you have the legs of an idol singer.

684
00:27:10,975 --> 00:27:14,985
She will achieve her dream sooner than her husband's.

685
00:27:15,045 --> 00:27:16,745
- That's entirely possible. - I know.

686
00:27:16,745 --> 00:27:19,386
How does it feel to learn about her dream?

687
00:27:19,386 --> 00:27:20,386
(How does it feel?)

688
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:23,656
I am embarrassed that I didn't know she had a dream.

689
00:27:24,755 --> 00:27:25,896
I feel bad.

690
00:27:26,255 --> 00:27:30,765
You're using a dream as an excuse to enjoy having a good time.

691
00:27:30,825 --> 00:27:33,465
Lastly, say what you want to say to your husband.

692
00:27:33,465 --> 00:27:36,505
Stop crying and be confident. Look at him.

693
00:27:36,505 --> 00:27:38,906
He is your husband.

694
00:27:39,775 --> 00:27:41,975
- From now on... - It's their first eye contact.

695
00:27:41,975 --> 00:27:44,206
From now on,

696
00:27:44,805 --> 00:27:48,416
I hope you would do your best in the work you do...

697
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:51,686
so that we can raise our children without a problem.

698
00:27:52,886 --> 00:27:53,956
Is there anything else you want to say?

699
00:27:55,386 --> 00:27:59,156
If people in the music industry are watching this program,

700
00:27:59,156 --> 00:28:03,166
I hope they wouldn't contact him with an offer to release an album.

701
00:28:03,166 --> 00:28:05,666
- I don't want that. - You don't have to worry.

702
00:28:05,666 --> 00:28:07,666
- You don't have to worry. - It won't happen.

703
00:28:07,666 --> 00:28:09,706
- You don't have to worry. - No one will contact him.

704
00:28:09,706 --> 00:28:10,706
(It's a needless worry.)

705
00:28:11,505 --> 00:28:13,305
Let's start with K.will.

706
00:28:13,336 --> 00:28:14,975
Put yourself in her shoes. Do you think it's a worry?

707
00:28:14,975 --> 00:28:19,245
When you want to do something, you look for excuses.

708
00:28:19,946 --> 00:28:22,646
At first, he said it was his father's dream...

709
00:28:22,646 --> 00:28:26,285
to perform in "National Singing Contest".

710
00:28:26,285 --> 00:28:30,626
Then he said he wants to achieve his dream for his children.

711
00:28:32,825 --> 00:28:35,495
- I don't usually say this, but... - Is it a worry or not?

712
00:28:35,495 --> 00:28:37,265
It's a big worry.

713
00:28:37,265 --> 00:28:40,336
Gosh, a man shouldn't be so chatty.

714
00:28:40,336 --> 00:28:41,866
- I am sorry. - Tae Oh, please keep it short.

715
00:28:41,866 --> 00:28:44,666
I thought that it wasn't a worry.

716
00:28:44,666 --> 00:28:47,735
Hearing the full story let me know that it's a serious worry.

717
00:28:47,876 --> 00:28:49,946
- Kang Nam. - In short, it's a worry.

718
00:28:50,706 --> 00:28:54,015
- Young Ji. - I also think it's a worry.

719
00:28:54,015 --> 00:28:59,055
I think Myung Shim has been raising four children.

720
00:28:59,055 --> 00:29:00,815
- That's right. - You know how children are.

721
00:29:00,815 --> 00:29:04,686
Even when they are sick, they lie in order to play more.

722
00:29:04,686 --> 00:29:07,225
He is being that kind of a nuisance.

723
00:29:07,225 --> 00:29:08,626
- He is an uncontrollable child. - Yes.

724
00:29:08,866 --> 00:29:11,696
If you think it's a worry, please press the button.

725
00:29:11,696 --> 00:29:13,295
(What does the audience think?)

726
00:29:14,035 --> 00:29:17,065
5, 4, 3,

727
00:29:17,065 --> 00:29:19,475
- 2, 1. - I don't think they will stop.

728
00:29:19,676 --> 00:29:21,606
- I don't think they will stop. - Time's up.

729
00:29:21,706 --> 00:29:24,245
Please say a few words to your wife.

730
00:29:24,275 --> 00:29:27,245
Now that we talked about what's on our minds here,

731
00:29:28,446 --> 00:29:30,245
I realized that I should change.

732
00:29:30,285 --> 00:29:31,686
I will try my best.

733
00:29:31,916 --> 00:29:34,086
I am always sorry and thankful. I love you.

734
00:29:34,116 --> 00:29:35,686
Please make this clear.

735
00:29:35,686 --> 00:29:37,825
If an agency contacts you after this episode airs...

736
00:29:37,825 --> 00:29:38,825
(It's 1 in 10,000 chance.)

737
00:29:38,825 --> 00:29:40,295
No one will contact him.

738
00:29:40,295 --> 00:29:42,126
If that happens, would you accept the offer?

739
00:29:42,965 --> 00:29:45,636
I am not ready yet.

740
00:29:46,396 --> 00:29:47,866
You should say that you won't accept the offer.

741
00:29:47,866 --> 00:29:48,866
- Don't say you aren't ready. - He says he isn't ready yet.

742
00:29:50,166 --> 00:29:51,575
I will turn down the offer.

743
00:29:51,575 --> 00:29:55,206
Don't dance in public when you are with your wife.

744
00:29:55,275 --> 00:29:58,346
Your son will enter an elementary school soon.

745
00:29:58,346 --> 00:30:01,616
When there are other parents, don't go, "Let me introduce myself."

746
00:30:01,745 --> 00:30:05,916
It will be hard on your wife.

747
00:30:05,916 --> 00:30:08,386
Let's see how many votes the worry got. Show us the result.

748
00:30:08,856 --> 00:30:10,626
"A Midlife Crisis Is the Worst".

749
00:30:11,325 --> 00:30:12,755
- I am curious. - All right.

750
00:30:12,755 --> 00:30:14,696
- The number is over 100. - Of course it did.

751
00:30:14,696 --> 00:30:17,025
(What will be the result?)

752
00:30:18,795 --> 00:30:19,795
- 155. - 155.

753
00:30:19,965 --> 00:30:22,065
The worry got a lot of votes.

754
00:30:22,065 --> 00:30:23,166
I have a headache.

755
00:30:23,235 --> 00:30:25,676
"Do I Look Like an ATM?"

756
00:30:25,876 --> 00:30:27,676
Hello, I am a woman who turned 30 this year.

757
00:30:27,706 --> 00:30:32,245
My worry involves someone who is incredibly immature.

758
00:30:32,245 --> 00:30:35,116
She leaves the house in a mess and does what she wants to do.

759
00:30:35,116 --> 00:30:38,515
When I scold her, she cries. She is practically a child...

760
00:30:38,656 --> 00:30:40,485
- who lives as she pleases. - Is she going through puberty?

761
00:30:40,485 --> 00:30:43,325
- Is she in 8th grade? - It's my 51-year-old mom.

762
00:30:43,825 --> 00:30:44,956
- Mom? - My goodness.

763
00:30:45,126 --> 00:30:47,156
"Golf is good for the health."

764
00:30:47,295 --> 00:30:50,225
"Ta-da! I bought golf clubs."

765
00:30:50,465 --> 00:30:51,596
"They are 3,500 dollars."

766
00:30:52,436 --> 00:30:53,565
How expensive. She must have bought good ones.

767
00:30:53,596 --> 00:30:57,666
"I need to buy clothes. Please give me 500 dollars."

768
00:30:57,666 --> 00:31:01,206
"Mom, when will you grow up? Please stop causing trouble."

769
00:31:01,305 --> 00:31:04,275
"Gosh, you should be used to my immaturity by now."

770
00:31:04,545 --> 00:31:08,116
"I heard that water skiing is in vogue these days."

771
00:31:08,416 --> 00:31:10,315
"From tomorrow on, I will learn how to water ski."

772
00:31:10,315 --> 00:31:13,785
I don't know who is raising who.

773
00:31:13,856 --> 00:31:15,186
"Mom, what is wrong with your face?"

774
00:31:15,186 --> 00:31:17,386
"Your forehead, chin, and nose are chafed. How did it happen?"

775
00:31:17,426 --> 00:31:20,356
"I think I fell down after I drank yesterday."

776
00:31:20,696 --> 00:31:22,965
"What is wrong with me?"

777
00:31:22,965 --> 00:31:25,295
She is very easily influenced, too. This happened once.

778
00:31:25,565 --> 00:31:28,235
"Ma'am, you have a talent in singing."

779
00:31:28,235 --> 00:31:30,606
- "You could be a singer." - No, no!

780
00:31:30,606 --> 00:31:32,505
- No! - Stop it. Please.

781
00:31:32,505 --> 00:31:33,575
No!

782
00:31:33,575 --> 00:31:35,946
Perhaps there will be a duo after this shoot.

783
00:31:35,946 --> 00:31:38,075
- No. - This is bad.

784
00:31:38,176 --> 00:31:41,515
"I made up my mind. I am going to be a trot singer."

785
00:31:41,916 --> 00:31:42,916
(Their worry came true.)

786
00:31:42,916 --> 00:31:43,916
"Help me release an album."

787
00:31:43,916 --> 00:31:45,956
"I really don't have money. Stop it already."

788
00:31:45,956 --> 00:31:47,815
- Everyone wants an album. - "You have installment savings."

789
00:31:47,815 --> 00:31:49,586
- "Use that money." - My goodness.

790
00:31:49,586 --> 00:31:52,025
I am 30 years old. I need to get married at some point,

791
00:31:52,196 --> 00:31:54,225
but everything I make goes to my mom.

792
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:57,225
How long do I need to live like this?

793
00:31:57,225 --> 00:31:58,696
(Please help my immature mother come to her senses.)

794
00:31:58,696 --> 00:32:01,265
Are we having an album special?

795
00:32:01,265 --> 00:32:02,265
Seriously.

796
00:32:02,265 --> 00:32:03,866
What is your opinion? I don't know what's going on today.

797
00:32:03,866 --> 00:32:06,275
During the first worry, I told Myung Shim's husband that...

798
00:32:06,406 --> 00:32:08,245
there is the right time for everything.

799
00:32:08,346 --> 00:32:10,975
I said he can pursue his dream after his children grow up.

800
00:32:11,005 --> 00:32:13,045
I see now it would be hard.

801
00:32:13,475 --> 00:32:16,015
No one should use his or her child's money for it.

802
00:32:16,045 --> 00:32:18,956
This woman is tired of looking after her immature mom.

803
00:32:18,956 --> 00:32:21,116
Let's talk to her. Please come on out.

804
00:32:21,116 --> 00:32:22,386
(Who is tired of looking after her immature mother?)

805
00:32:26,696 --> 00:32:28,596
(He disappears.)

806
00:32:29,426 --> 00:32:31,836
(He sacrificed himself to make people laugh.)

807
00:32:32,836 --> 00:32:34,765
It's slippery.

808
00:32:36,265 --> 00:32:37,436
(Yoo Min Hee)

809
00:32:37,436 --> 00:32:39,235
She is the daughter.

810
00:32:40,975 --> 00:32:42,846
- Tae Oh, are you okay? - Yes.

811
00:32:43,305 --> 00:32:45,376
Tae Oh, since you collapsed,

812
00:32:45,376 --> 00:32:47,475
we were more worried about you.

813
00:32:47,846 --> 00:32:48,916
I didn't know the pool would be deep.

814
00:32:48,916 --> 00:32:51,386
- Why did you do that? - I don't think that was the case.

815
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:53,356
I think he just collapsed.

816
00:32:53,356 --> 00:32:54,815
He didn't watch where he was going.

817
00:32:54,815 --> 00:32:56,156
Please introduce yourself.

818
00:32:56,225 --> 00:32:57,656
I am from Icheon, Gyeonggi Province.

819
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:00,795
I am a 30-year-old, Yoo Min Hee.

820
00:33:00,795 --> 00:33:02,965
- Min Hee, welcome. - Welcome.

821
00:33:03,866 --> 00:33:05,965
How immature is your mom?

822
00:33:05,965 --> 00:33:09,936
When I was young, my parents got a divorce.

823
00:33:10,065 --> 00:33:11,505
Did it happen long time ago?

824
00:33:11,505 --> 00:33:13,436
Yes. I was in elementary school. Because of that,

825
00:33:13,676 --> 00:33:16,475
I began to live with my mom.

826
00:33:17,376 --> 00:33:20,045
Everyone says that I raise my mom,

827
00:33:20,045 --> 00:33:22,616
not the other way around.

828
00:33:23,386 --> 00:33:27,055
I am responsible for all household chores.

829
00:33:27,055 --> 00:33:29,686
When she goes outside for a short moment,

830
00:33:29,686 --> 00:33:31,525
she tries on dozens of outfits.

831
00:33:31,956 --> 00:33:33,656
- She does that. - She throws them on the floor.

832
00:33:33,656 --> 00:33:35,295
- She doesn't clean after herself. - No, she doesn't.

833
00:33:35,565 --> 00:33:38,535
When she eats at home, she leaves the dishes on the table.

834
00:33:39,065 --> 00:33:41,336
In summer, the food rots.

835
00:33:41,336 --> 00:33:42,366
(It makes the house smell bad.)

836
00:33:42,366 --> 00:33:45,436
It would be moldy. There are times I can't go home...

837
00:33:45,436 --> 00:33:47,075
- because of work. - The food rots.

838
00:33:47,075 --> 00:33:48,176
Yes. It would be moldy.

839
00:33:48,176 --> 00:33:49,575
Does food become moldy?

840
00:33:49,975 --> 00:33:50,975
What?

841
00:33:52,515 --> 00:33:53,676
It happens with leftovers.

842
00:33:53,676 --> 00:33:55,886
- It happens with leftovers. - She never gets leftovers.

843
00:33:56,916 --> 00:33:58,856
It sounds like your mom has to do...

844
00:33:58,856 --> 00:34:01,586
- whatever she wants. - She gets sick otherwise.

845
00:34:01,586 --> 00:34:02,956
- Give us some examples. - She gets depressed.

846
00:34:02,956 --> 00:34:06,256
A few years ago, she was determined to learn how to water ski.

847
00:34:06,555 --> 00:34:10,425
She ended up tearing her knee ligament.

848
00:34:10,425 --> 00:34:12,166
Why do we keep hearing about a torn ligament today?

849
00:34:12,166 --> 00:34:13,966
- We keep hearing about it. - Seriously.

850
00:34:13,966 --> 00:34:16,635
- She got a cast on her leg. - I see.

851
00:34:16,666 --> 00:34:20,776
She was so badly injured that she couldn't go to the toilet.

852
00:34:20,936 --> 00:34:23,376
The next morning, she went to water ski again.

853
00:34:23,845 --> 00:34:25,416
It sounds like she is full of good cheer.

854
00:34:25,416 --> 00:34:27,546
How much is the equipment?

855
00:34:27,546 --> 00:34:28,686
Didn't she rent the equipment?

856
00:34:28,686 --> 00:34:30,015
- No, she didn't. - Did she buy the equipment?

857
00:34:30,015 --> 00:34:31,285
- Yes, she did. - Doesn't it cost 10,000 dollars?

858
00:34:31,285 --> 00:34:32,856
- She bought the equipment? - Yes.

859
00:34:32,856 --> 00:34:36,186
It costs 2,000 dollars a month to water ski.

860
00:34:36,186 --> 00:34:37,626
Did you pay for everything?

861
00:34:37,956 --> 00:34:40,526
Yes, I did. My mom paid a small portion of it.

862
00:34:40,595 --> 00:34:42,095
You must have made a lot of money.

863
00:34:42,466 --> 00:34:44,296
My mom used up everything I earned.

864
00:34:44,296 --> 00:34:46,566
- What about installment savings? - What about golf?

865
00:34:46,566 --> 00:34:49,966
Even before she learned how to golf,

866
00:34:49,966 --> 00:34:52,236
she bought 3,500 dollars' worth of golf clubs.

867
00:34:52,236 --> 00:34:53,975
- Some people buy equipment first. - That's right.

868
00:34:53,975 --> 00:34:56,175
- That's right. - She got an annual membership.

869
00:34:56,175 --> 00:34:57,506
- An annual membership? - Yes.

870
00:34:57,506 --> 00:34:58,575
- Isn't it really expensive? - Yes, it is.

871
00:34:58,575 --> 00:35:00,675
- My goodness. - She golfed once or twice...

872
00:35:00,945 --> 00:35:03,345
and said that it doesn't suit her.

873
00:35:03,586 --> 00:35:05,456
- That's such a waste. - She stopped going.

874
00:35:05,456 --> 00:35:07,256
What is the story about the album?

875
00:35:08,456 --> 00:35:09,725
- She sighed. - My mom...

876
00:35:09,956 --> 00:35:12,495
- often sings for volunteer work. - She doesn't get paid for that.

877
00:35:12,495 --> 00:35:14,555
Whenever she does that, the others tell her...

878
00:35:14,756 --> 00:35:17,265
It's an event that doesn't earn you any money.

879
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:20,595
The others tell her, "You can sing very well."

880
00:35:20,595 --> 00:35:23,865
"You should be a singer." Upon hearing those compliments,

881
00:35:23,865 --> 00:35:28,646
she closed the restaurant and became absorbed in trot music.

882
00:35:28,975 --> 00:35:32,046
Is she currently working as a trot singer?

883
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:33,945
She is a regional singer who isn't well-known.

884
00:35:34,115 --> 00:35:36,686
- A regional singer. - A regional singer.

885
00:35:36,816 --> 00:35:37,945
- Is she a singer? - What's the region?

886
00:35:37,945 --> 00:35:39,686
- Icheon. - Icheon, Gyeonggi Province.

887
00:35:39,686 --> 00:35:41,756
- She doesn't get paid. - No.

888
00:35:42,425 --> 00:35:43,456
What?

889
00:35:43,586 --> 00:35:45,495
That's ridiculous.

890
00:35:45,495 --> 00:35:47,325
The first worry was similar.

891
00:35:47,325 --> 00:35:49,566
At Korean Melon Festival, she receives Korean melons.

892
00:35:49,566 --> 00:35:50,925
- At least she gets something. - At Ceramic Festival,

893
00:35:50,925 --> 00:35:53,035
- she receives ceramics. - At least she gets something.

894
00:35:53,035 --> 00:35:54,796
How many albums has she released?

895
00:35:54,966 --> 00:35:57,305
She has released two albums so far.

896
00:35:57,305 --> 00:35:58,975
- She did release albums. - She is a regional singer.

897
00:35:58,975 --> 00:36:03,445
It costs a lot of money to release an album.

898
00:36:03,675 --> 00:36:05,345
It costs about 40,000 to 50,000 dollars.

899
00:36:05,345 --> 00:36:06,716
(She spends about 40,000 to 50,000 dollars.)

900
00:36:06,816 --> 00:36:08,945
- That's how much it costs. - It's usually cheaper than that.

901
00:36:08,945 --> 00:36:10,445
- It's a single, right? - I don't know.

902
00:36:10,445 --> 00:36:12,816
- Did she film a music video? - No, she didn't.

903
00:36:12,816 --> 00:36:14,115
I am sure...

904
00:36:14,115 --> 00:36:16,456
she got swindled by an agency.

905
00:36:16,456 --> 00:36:18,825
It could be that Min Hee got swindled by her mom.

906
00:36:18,825 --> 00:36:20,296
That's right.

907
00:36:20,296 --> 00:36:21,456
40,000 dollars is a ridiculous amount.

908
00:36:21,456 --> 00:36:22,495
It's one of the two.

909
00:36:22,495 --> 00:36:25,365
My mom also likes to buy clothes.

910
00:36:25,365 --> 00:36:27,495
She doesn't wear the clothes often after she buys them.

911
00:36:27,495 --> 00:36:31,675
Her stage outfit costs about 500 to 600 dollars.

912
00:36:31,776 --> 00:36:34,535
- You must have a negative balance. - She buys designer clothes.

913
00:36:34,606 --> 00:36:37,075
Events are held at different places with different audiences.

914
00:36:37,075 --> 00:36:38,175
She could wear the same outfit.

915
00:36:38,175 --> 00:36:41,646
Even singers wear the outfit they wore on a show...

916
00:36:41,646 --> 00:36:43,385
when they perform at events around the country.

917
00:36:43,385 --> 00:36:44,956
- That's right. - Even the famous ones do that.

918
00:36:44,956 --> 00:36:47,256
They wear the same outfit for a season.

919
00:36:47,256 --> 00:36:49,925
You must have a lot of money.

920
00:36:50,425 --> 00:36:51,456
No, I don't.

921
00:36:51,456 --> 00:36:53,195
It sounds like you are a millionaire.

922
00:36:53,195 --> 00:36:54,256
Seriously.

923
00:36:54,256 --> 00:36:55,296
A conglomerate family.

924
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:58,166
I have credit card debts piled up.

925
00:36:58,166 --> 00:37:01,265
She used up the money she got from selling the restaurant.

926
00:37:01,265 --> 00:37:03,765
We now live in a house with a monthly rent.

927
00:37:03,765 --> 00:37:05,305
- You are becoming poorer. - Yes.

928
00:37:05,305 --> 00:37:06,606
We now live in a house with a monthly rent.

929
00:37:06,606 --> 00:37:08,606
Let's talk to the immature mom. Hello.

930
00:37:08,606 --> 00:37:10,106
- Hello. - Hello.

931
00:37:10,106 --> 00:37:11,475
(Who is the immature mom who uses her daughter's money?)

932
00:37:12,345 --> 00:37:13,776
- Ma'am. - Yes.

933
00:37:13,776 --> 00:37:16,046
Do you think that you are immature?

934
00:37:16,046 --> 00:37:17,245
(Does she think that she is immature?)

935
00:37:17,245 --> 00:37:18,316
Yes, I do.

936
00:37:18,316 --> 00:37:20,416
Really? Did you know...

937
00:37:20,416 --> 00:37:21,626
about your daughter's worry?

938
00:37:21,626 --> 00:37:24,896
Because I only think about myself,

939
00:37:24,896 --> 00:37:28,995
I didn't think it would be a serious worry for her.

940
00:37:28,995 --> 00:37:30,595
When did you take up trot music?

941
00:37:30,595 --> 00:37:33,166
I sang for volunteer work for about 15 years...

942
00:37:33,595 --> 00:37:37,566
at senior care centers and such.

943
00:37:37,566 --> 00:37:39,706
They said, "You can sing very well."

944
00:37:39,706 --> 00:37:42,046
"Why don't you release an album?"

945
00:37:42,046 --> 00:37:43,245
- People asked you that. - Yes.

946
00:37:43,245 --> 00:37:45,046
That's how I released an album.

947
00:37:45,046 --> 00:37:48,146
Your daughter says it doesn't bring in much money.

948
00:37:48,146 --> 00:37:51,856
I mostly donate my talent.

949
00:37:51,856 --> 00:37:53,356
- It's a talent donation. - That's right.

950
00:37:53,356 --> 00:37:55,686
I donate my talent...

951
00:37:55,686 --> 00:37:58,456
for organizations for disabled or neglected people.

952
00:37:58,456 --> 00:38:00,296
- It's good to volunteer. - Yes.

953
00:38:00,296 --> 00:38:02,995
Singing gives me happiness.

954
00:38:02,995 --> 00:38:05,635
Even if I don't have anything to eat tomorrow,

955
00:38:05,635 --> 00:38:07,995
I am happy when I sing.

956
00:38:07,995 --> 00:38:09,365
That's right. It's good...

957
00:38:09,365 --> 00:38:11,066
that you sing for volunteer work.

958
00:38:11,066 --> 00:38:14,106
It would have been great had you not released an album.

959
00:38:14,106 --> 00:38:16,376
That's right. You could have sung hit songs by other singers.

960
00:38:16,376 --> 00:38:19,615
When I performed at events,

961
00:38:19,615 --> 00:38:21,615
people called me a fake singer.

962
00:38:21,615 --> 00:38:22,615
They called you a fake singer.

963
00:38:22,615 --> 00:38:24,745
- She used to cover hit songs. - When I performed,

964
00:38:24,745 --> 00:38:27,316
people said, "Isn't she a fake singer?"

965
00:38:27,316 --> 00:38:30,885
Now that you released albums, do you sing your own songs?

966
00:38:30,885 --> 00:38:32,756
There are times I sing my own songs.

967
00:38:32,756 --> 00:38:34,966
- People don't know your songs. - Of course they don't.

968
00:38:34,966 --> 00:38:37,095
- "What kind of a singer is she?" - I am not surprised.

969
00:38:37,095 --> 00:38:40,296
That's why I don't sing my songs often.

970
00:38:40,296 --> 00:38:43,936
Releasing two albums didn't help much in the end.

971
00:38:44,305 --> 00:38:45,675
- That's why... - They are useless.

972
00:38:45,675 --> 00:38:48,445
Why do you keep asking for your daughter's help?

973
00:38:48,445 --> 00:38:50,776
I depend on my daughter a lot.

974
00:38:50,776 --> 00:38:52,615
That's why I keep asking for her help.

975
00:38:52,615 --> 00:38:55,115
When it's her payday, I can't help but think,

976
00:38:55,115 --> 00:38:56,115
"Won't she give me money?"

977
00:38:56,115 --> 00:38:58,015
When I walk around complaining about money,

978
00:38:58,015 --> 00:39:01,925
she puts allowance on my vanity.

979
00:39:01,925 --> 00:39:04,486
Did you really ask her to close her installment savings account?

980
00:39:04,486 --> 00:39:06,356
Since I wanted to release another album,

981
00:39:06,356 --> 00:39:08,825
I asked her if she has installment savings.

982
00:39:08,825 --> 00:39:11,296
Through which company did you release an album...

983
00:39:11,296 --> 00:39:14,396
- that it cost thousands of dollars? - Seriously.

984
00:39:14,396 --> 00:39:16,936
When I released my first album,

985
00:39:18,236 --> 00:39:19,635
it cost that much.

986
00:39:19,635 --> 00:39:21,475
Were you swindled?

987
00:39:21,475 --> 00:39:24,405
I received songs from a composer.

988
00:39:24,405 --> 00:39:28,986
It wasn't the composer who swindled me.

989
00:39:28,986 --> 00:39:32,086
- The ones around him did. - A broker.

990
00:39:32,086 --> 00:39:33,515
That's right.

991
00:39:33,515 --> 00:39:36,785
She gave that much money because she was told to.

992
00:39:36,785 --> 00:39:39,456
She doesn't even know in which process she got swindled.

993
00:39:39,456 --> 00:39:40,495
- No, she doesn't. - That's right.

994
00:39:40,495 --> 00:39:41,595
She just gave them the money.

995
00:39:41,595 --> 00:39:43,365
How much did it cost to release your second album?

996
00:39:43,365 --> 00:39:45,765
It didn't cost as much.

997
00:39:45,836 --> 00:39:47,296
- How much did it cost? - 30,000 dollars?

998
00:39:47,566 --> 00:39:49,736
- 20,000 dollars. 25,000 dollars. - 40,000 dollars.

999
00:39:49,936 --> 00:39:52,106
We came close, right?

1000
00:39:52,106 --> 00:39:54,436
It didn't cost as much as the first album.

1001
00:39:54,436 --> 00:39:56,376
Since her 1st album cost 50,000 dollars,

1002
00:39:56,376 --> 00:39:58,245
she must have signed a contract readily...

1003
00:39:58,245 --> 00:39:59,845
when someone said he can do it for 40,000 dollars.

1004
00:39:59,845 --> 00:40:01,745
"I was swindled 10,000 dollars."

1005
00:40:01,745 --> 00:40:03,716
Even 40,000 dollars is a ridiculous amount.

1006
00:40:03,716 --> 00:40:05,456
Does she get conned often?

1007
00:40:05,456 --> 00:40:07,356
About six months ago,

1008
00:40:07,956 --> 00:40:09,885
she brought a strange contract.

1009
00:40:09,885 --> 00:40:13,095
I could tell that it was suspicious, so I told her clearly...

1010
00:40:13,095 --> 00:40:14,456
not to sign it.

1011
00:40:14,456 --> 00:40:16,296
However, she went ahead with it without my knowledge.

1012
00:40:16,296 --> 00:40:18,865
I ended up paying 7,000 dollars...

1013
00:40:18,865 --> 00:40:20,595
for the contract.

1014
00:40:20,595 --> 00:40:22,066
She signed a contract with an agency as a singer...

1015
00:40:22,066 --> 00:40:24,135
- and gave them money. - Did she really do that?

1016
00:40:24,135 --> 00:40:26,075
She should be the one receiving money in that situation.

1017
00:40:26,075 --> 00:40:27,975
Everyone should know this.

1018
00:40:27,975 --> 00:40:30,206
There is no proper agency in the world that asks for money.

1019
00:40:30,206 --> 00:40:31,405
It's a con by 100 percent.

1020
00:40:31,405 --> 00:40:33,376
When I perform at events,

1021
00:40:33,376 --> 00:40:35,445
there are people who give me their business cards...

1022
00:40:35,445 --> 00:40:37,816
and introduce themselves as composers.

1023
00:40:37,816 --> 00:40:41,825
"You need vocal training."

1024
00:40:41,825 --> 00:40:46,225
"It will cost money, but you will be able to perform at bigger stages."

1025
00:40:46,225 --> 00:40:47,856
I was scammed.

1026
00:40:47,856 --> 00:40:49,566
- It was a textbook scam. - I guess people still do that.

1027
00:40:49,566 --> 00:40:52,566
When I called them later, it was a non-existent number.

1028
00:40:52,566 --> 00:40:56,236
How much money in installment savings did you lose?

1029
00:40:56,236 --> 00:40:58,575
- Give us an estimate. - I think...

1030
00:40:58,575 --> 00:41:00,135
it's about 40,000 dollars.

1031
00:41:00,905 --> 00:41:01,945
(My goodness.)

1032
00:41:02,175 --> 00:41:03,445
That's a lot of money.

1033
00:41:04,276 --> 00:41:07,445
Has your mom ever paid you back?

1034
00:41:07,776 --> 00:41:09,515
- No, she hasn't. - She hasn't done it once.

1035
00:41:09,515 --> 00:41:10,686
No, not once.

1036
00:41:10,686 --> 00:41:13,086
- She was scammed by her mom. - I will pay her back.

1037
00:41:13,115 --> 00:41:15,155
You will pay her back. How will you do that?

1038
00:41:15,155 --> 00:41:19,296
I don't know how I will do that.

1039
00:41:19,296 --> 00:41:20,495
- What are you talking about? - However, I will pay her back.

1040
00:41:20,495 --> 00:41:22,966
- I will do it by any means. - How will you pay her back?

1041
00:41:22,966 --> 00:41:23,995
(Frustrated)

1042
00:41:24,095 --> 00:41:25,535
How did you save that money?

1043
00:41:25,535 --> 00:41:27,236
(How did she save that money?)

1044
00:41:27,236 --> 00:41:28,805
After I graduated from high school,

1045
00:41:28,805 --> 00:41:31,805
I worked as a salesperson for many years.

1046
00:41:31,805 --> 00:41:34,006
- I sold clothes. - You sold clothes.

1047
00:41:34,006 --> 00:41:37,305
I didn't even eat what I wanted to eat.

1048
00:41:37,305 --> 00:41:39,615
If I wanted to buy clothes,

1049
00:41:39,615 --> 00:41:42,716
I bought things that cost 9 dollars and 99 cents and such.

1050
00:41:42,716 --> 00:41:45,785
I worked hard to save 800 dollars.

1051
00:41:45,785 --> 00:41:47,155
- You saved that much every month. - Yes.

1052
00:41:47,155 --> 00:41:49,086
You saved up diligently.

1053
00:41:49,086 --> 00:41:51,655
- That was the installment savings. - Everything is gone now.

1054
00:41:51,956 --> 00:41:53,695
I don't have anything now.

1055
00:41:53,695 --> 00:41:55,466
- What about for your wedding? - I don't have anything.

1056
00:41:55,466 --> 00:41:57,396
- What should she do? - I don't have money for a wedding.

1057
00:41:57,896 --> 00:41:59,796
Have you tried talking to your mom?

1058
00:41:59,796 --> 00:42:02,166
"I can't give you more money. You really need to stop."

1059
00:42:02,166 --> 00:42:03,405
Have you done that?

1060
00:42:03,405 --> 00:42:05,075
- I have. - What did she say?

1061
00:42:05,075 --> 00:42:08,305
When I tell her that, she cries.

1062
00:42:08,305 --> 00:42:12,716
"Because of me, you can't do what you want to do."

1063
00:42:12,716 --> 00:42:15,615
- My goodness. - "I know that. I am sorry."

1064
00:42:15,615 --> 00:42:17,186
After that,

1065
00:42:17,186 --> 00:42:19,615
she reverts to her usual self.

1066
00:42:19,615 --> 00:42:21,316
- She does that again. - It's a scam.

1067
00:42:21,316 --> 00:42:23,956
- She can't turn down a request. - What has happened because of it?

1068
00:42:23,956 --> 00:42:27,195
- When her friends ask for money... - She lends it to them.

1069
00:42:27,195 --> 00:42:30,166
Even when she doesn't have money, she uses her credit card.

1070
00:42:30,166 --> 00:42:31,796
- Does she use her credit card? - She gets a cash advance...

1071
00:42:31,796 --> 00:42:34,236
and lends it to her friends. The problem is,

1072
00:42:34,236 --> 00:42:37,566
she doesn't know how to ask them to pay it back.

1073
00:42:37,966 --> 00:42:40,106
There is a lot of money she never got back.

1074
00:42:40,475 --> 00:42:41,905
What should we do when the problem is this serious?

1075
00:42:41,975 --> 00:42:43,975
- This is frustrating. - What should we do?

1076
00:42:43,975 --> 00:42:45,546
You know how she earned that money, right?

1077
00:42:45,546 --> 00:42:48,285
I know that she worked hard for that money.

1078
00:42:48,285 --> 00:42:51,515
Then how can you lend that kind of money so easily?

1079
00:42:51,515 --> 00:42:53,716
While I am not good to my daughter,

1080
00:42:53,716 --> 00:42:55,986
I am very good to those around me.

1081
00:42:56,425 --> 00:42:57,725
(What kind of nonsense is that?)

1082
00:42:57,725 --> 00:42:59,526
- My goodness. - How can you be...

1083
00:42:59,526 --> 00:43:00,695
so confident about it?

1084
00:43:00,695 --> 00:43:02,566
I was so surprised to hear her say it so confidently.

1085
00:43:02,566 --> 00:43:03,695
Why do you say that?

1086
00:43:03,695 --> 00:43:06,635
When the others tell me about their situation,

1087
00:43:06,635 --> 00:43:08,566
- I can't turn down their request. - Look.

1088
00:43:08,566 --> 00:43:10,265
Your daughter is telling you about her situation,

1089
00:43:10,265 --> 00:43:11,675
but you aren't listening.

1090
00:43:11,675 --> 00:43:13,706
Why do you listen to everyone...

1091
00:43:13,706 --> 00:43:15,975
- but your daughter? - Seriously.

1092
00:43:15,975 --> 00:43:17,675
When I began to make money,

1093
00:43:17,675 --> 00:43:20,115
my mom kept asking me to do things for my brother.

1094
00:43:20,115 --> 00:43:22,845
I decided to show her how hard I work...

1095
00:43:22,845 --> 00:43:24,345
so that she wouldn't ask me for money so easily.

1096
00:43:24,345 --> 00:43:25,916
I was very busy back then.

1097
00:43:25,956 --> 00:43:28,086
I would attend two shoots in a day...

1098
00:43:28,086 --> 00:43:29,756
and go to eight different events at night.

1099
00:43:29,756 --> 00:43:32,026
I dragged my mom everywhere. I said, "You saw that, right?"

1100
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:36,566
Then I realized it might have been a mistake.

1101
00:43:36,566 --> 00:43:38,765
"I see that you make a lot of money."

1102
00:43:40,695 --> 00:43:42,336
- "You make a lot of money." - She said that.

1103
00:43:42,336 --> 00:43:43,535
It had an adverse effect.

1104
00:43:43,535 --> 00:43:44,836
She didn't know...

1105
00:43:44,836 --> 00:43:47,236
I was making that much money.

1106
00:43:47,236 --> 00:43:49,506
There is a debt...

1107
00:43:49,506 --> 00:43:52,845
you haven't told your daughter about, right?

1108
00:43:53,515 --> 00:43:54,716
Yes, there is.

1109
00:43:55,445 --> 00:43:57,785
- What is it? - Why are you so confident?

1110
00:43:57,785 --> 00:43:59,186
- My goodness. - What is it? Tell us.

1111
00:43:59,186 --> 00:44:01,586
I have a personal loan...

1112
00:44:01,586 --> 00:44:03,425
as well as money I borrowed from a friend.

1113
00:44:03,425 --> 00:44:05,896
It adds up to about 20,000 dollars.

1114
00:44:05,896 --> 00:44:07,055
Why did you borrow money?

1115
00:44:07,356 --> 00:44:10,566
I had to go to different places to perform.

1116
00:44:10,566 --> 00:44:12,535
- You used it for your performances. - Yes.

1117
00:44:12,535 --> 00:44:15,135
- You need money for costumes, - Yes. That's why I took out a loan.

1118
00:44:15,135 --> 00:44:17,905
transportation, and food.

1119
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:20,635
A friend of hers is here. Let's talk to her.

1120
00:44:20,635 --> 00:44:22,945
- Hello. - Hello.

1121
00:44:24,075 --> 00:44:25,175
What are you most upset about?

1122
00:44:25,175 --> 00:44:26,646
What I am most upset about is...

1123
00:44:26,646 --> 00:44:28,316
I didn't know about these problems.

1124
00:44:28,316 --> 00:44:29,885
I am very frustrated right now.

1125
00:44:29,885 --> 00:44:32,055
- You didn't know the full story. - No, I didn't.

1126
00:44:32,055 --> 00:44:33,316
- You didn't know. - No.

1127
00:44:33,486 --> 00:44:36,086
- How does it feel to hear about it? - I am almost in tears.

1128
00:44:36,086 --> 00:44:38,325
When I was struggling with my business,

1129
00:44:38,325 --> 00:44:40,055
I had borrowed 10,000 dollars from her.

1130
00:44:40,055 --> 00:44:42,225
- You had borrowed it from her. - I thought she was doing well.

1131
00:44:42,765 --> 00:44:45,436
Hearing the full story choked me up.

1132
00:44:45,436 --> 00:44:46,796
It's difficult to get the words out.

1133
00:44:46,796 --> 00:44:48,066
You paid back 10,000 dollars, right?

1134
00:44:48,066 --> 00:44:49,736
- Of course I did. - She wouldn't be here otherwise.

1135
00:44:49,736 --> 00:44:50,905
You know,

1136
00:44:51,336 --> 00:44:55,405
- she was scammed many times. - I know about that.

1137
00:44:55,405 --> 00:44:58,046
She used a lot of money to release her albums...

1138
00:44:58,046 --> 00:45:01,445
and have vocal training.

1139
00:45:01,445 --> 00:45:04,015
She was scammed many times.

1140
00:45:04,015 --> 00:45:08,225
She lost about 100,000 or 200,000 dollars...

1141
00:45:08,686 --> 00:45:09,986
as far as I know.

1142
00:45:09,986 --> 00:45:11,256
- 100,000 or 200,000 dollars? - Yes.

1143
00:45:11,256 --> 00:45:14,155
- 100,000 or 200,000 dollars? - In total.

1144
00:45:14,325 --> 00:45:17,995
If Min Hee's mom takes up a different profession,

1145
00:45:17,995 --> 00:45:19,796
the situation wouldn't be this bad.

1146
00:45:19,796 --> 00:45:22,206
It would be the right thing to give up.

1147
00:45:22,405 --> 00:45:26,475
However, thinking about my friend gives me a change of heart.

1148
00:45:26,475 --> 00:45:27,905
- Thinking about her daughter... - Is she a talented singer?

1149
00:45:27,905 --> 00:45:30,046
- What? - Is she a talented singer?

1150
00:45:30,046 --> 00:45:32,876
I think she can sing very well.

1151
00:45:32,876 --> 00:45:36,186
I am curious about her singing skills.

1152
00:45:36,186 --> 00:45:38,416
- I know. - We saw a dance earlier.

1153
00:45:38,416 --> 00:45:39,956
It's time to listen to a song.

1154
00:45:39,956 --> 00:45:41,515
Would you like to dance behind her?

1155
00:45:42,885 --> 00:45:45,095
- He doesn't want to. - He is sick and tired of it now.

1156
00:45:45,095 --> 00:45:47,325
- Thank goodness. - He doesn't want to.

1157
00:45:47,325 --> 00:45:49,695
We are seeing some positive changes.

1158
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:52,595
I would have said something had he gone, "I will do that."

1159
00:45:52,595 --> 00:45:54,095
- She is very tall. - I know.

1160
00:45:54,095 --> 00:45:55,206
She is cool.

1161
00:45:55,606 --> 00:45:57,336
("Brother" by Kum Jan Di)

1162
00:46:00,635 --> 00:46:04,606
(Since you say you love me)

1163
00:46:04,606 --> 00:46:05,776
(My goodness.)

1164
00:46:07,675 --> 00:46:10,615
(Since you say you really do)

1165
00:46:11,756 --> 00:46:12,986
She's pretty good.

1166
00:46:13,956 --> 00:46:17,186
(I ride the clouds)

1167
00:46:21,666 --> 00:46:24,936
(And soar into the bright sky)

1168
00:46:24,995 --> 00:46:26,466
(She isn't half bad.)

1169
00:46:31,265 --> 00:46:36,046
(She sings with a steady and relaxed voice.)

1170
00:46:37,745 --> 00:46:39,675
(This is wrong.)

1171
00:46:41,945 --> 00:46:45,655
(Even if I die right now, I have no regrets)

1172
00:46:49,555 --> 00:46:52,725
(I am happy that I am a woman)

1173
00:46:54,796 --> 00:46:57,995
Wasn't it surprising that she's actually good?

1174
00:46:57,995 --> 00:47:00,736
It felt like she was good...

1175
00:47:00,736 --> 00:47:02,966
because we saw someone dancing first.

1176
00:47:03,106 --> 00:47:06,236
- It's because of that. - His dancing was too weak.

1177
00:47:06,236 --> 00:47:07,535
What did you think of her singing, K.will?

1178
00:47:07,535 --> 00:47:09,876
Watching her, I... My gosh.

1179
00:47:10,945 --> 00:47:12,515
- What is it? - What's wrong?

1180
00:47:12,515 --> 00:47:14,845
She can't give up.

1181
00:47:14,885 --> 00:47:16,515
She can't get rid of the desire.

1182
00:47:16,515 --> 00:47:19,986
I understand that she's very desperate to do it.

1183
00:47:19,986 --> 00:47:22,825
But she can sing anywhere.

1184
00:47:22,825 --> 00:47:25,796
She could sing on the streets. All she needs is a mic.

1185
00:47:25,796 --> 00:47:29,026
She can have just one outfit for her performance.

1186
00:47:29,026 --> 00:47:30,995
- I want to ask her that. - You could have one outfit.

1187
00:47:30,995 --> 00:47:33,796
Ma'am, why do you buy new clothes...

1188
00:47:33,796 --> 00:47:36,436
when you go to different events and meet new people?

1189
00:47:37,365 --> 00:47:40,236
I don't want to go on stage wearing old clothes.

1190
00:47:40,236 --> 00:47:41,436
(She wants to wear new clothes every time she performs.)

1191
00:47:41,436 --> 00:47:43,445
- She is... - She's irresponsible and greedy.

1192
00:47:43,445 --> 00:47:44,745
Look.

1193
00:47:44,745 --> 00:47:47,816
I am starting to doubt...

1194
00:47:48,245 --> 00:47:50,316
if you actually love singing.

1195
00:47:50,316 --> 00:47:52,115
Perhaps you just want to become famous.

1196
00:47:52,155 --> 00:47:54,986
You already act as if you are a big celebrity.

1197
00:47:54,986 --> 00:47:57,825
It's not like your performances are aired on TV,

1198
00:47:57,825 --> 00:47:59,695
and yet you refuse to wear the clothes you’ve worn once.

1199
00:47:59,695 --> 00:48:02,925
It doesn't seem like you love singing so much.

1200
00:48:02,925 --> 00:48:04,126
- It doesn't seem like it. - Yes.

1201
00:48:04,126 --> 00:48:06,635
I don't do that only when I sing.

1202
00:48:06,736 --> 00:48:09,305
- I think that's how she lives. - I love buying new clothes,

1203
00:48:09,305 --> 00:48:10,936
- and I like changing clothes. - But...

1204
00:48:10,936 --> 00:48:12,535
- When I go somewhere... - You need to see the reality.

1205
00:48:12,535 --> 00:48:16,475
Once I wear the clothes once, I rarely wear them again.

1206
00:48:16,475 --> 00:48:20,015
Are you saying you have to live like that because it's how you are?

1207
00:48:20,015 --> 00:48:21,345
Yes.

1208
00:48:21,416 --> 00:48:24,015
You should change the way you think.

1209
00:48:24,015 --> 00:48:25,285
You should change.

1210
00:48:25,285 --> 00:48:26,515
- She should change. - She should change.

1211
00:48:26,515 --> 00:48:28,325
By any chance, do you drink a lot?

1212
00:48:28,325 --> 00:48:29,555
- It's... - I love to drink.

1213
00:48:29,725 --> 00:48:31,186
- What did she say? - I love to drink.

1214
00:48:31,186 --> 00:48:33,256
- Why would you brag it? - She loves to drink too.

1215
00:48:33,296 --> 00:48:36,026
There was a time when she drank every day of the week.

1216
00:48:36,026 --> 00:48:39,336
When I came home from work, all the lights were on.

1217
00:48:39,336 --> 00:48:41,765
All the clothes were scattered in the living room.

1218
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:45,736
I thought someone broke in, and I got really surprised.

1219
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:48,475
When I went in, I found my mother...

1220
00:48:48,475 --> 00:48:51,916
passed out on the bed with her shoes on.

1221
00:48:51,916 --> 00:48:55,885
When I saw her face, her entire face was scratched.

1222
00:48:56,686 --> 00:48:58,086
- You must've been so surprised. - Why did she do that?

1223
00:48:58,086 --> 00:49:01,725
- Really? - She fell after drinking.

1224
00:49:01,725 --> 00:49:03,686
Why do you drink so much?

1225
00:49:03,686 --> 00:49:06,126
- I love drinking. - You binge-drink.

1226
00:49:06,126 --> 00:49:09,365
Yes. I binge-drink, and I get drunk.

1227
00:49:09,365 --> 00:49:10,365
- Some people are like that. - My goodness.

1228
00:49:10,365 --> 00:49:12,635
But the problem is that she can't remember things.

1229
00:49:12,635 --> 00:49:15,706
But I don't behave badly even when I am drunk.

1230
00:49:15,706 --> 00:49:17,936
- That's behaving badly. - That's behaving badly.

1231
00:49:17,936 --> 00:49:19,736
Their positions are switched.

1232
00:49:19,736 --> 00:49:20,836
- I know. - I know.

1233
00:49:20,836 --> 00:49:23,245
She's not a typical mother figure.

1234
00:49:23,445 --> 00:49:26,146
My gosh. Why do you do it?

1235
00:49:26,416 --> 00:49:30,186
I married young and had children young.

1236
00:49:30,186 --> 00:49:34,385
I had a dream, but... I was often upset about it.

1237
00:49:34,456 --> 00:49:38,325
Before I got divorced, whenever my children were sleeping,

1238
00:49:38,325 --> 00:49:40,325
I thought about how unhappy I was.

1239
00:49:40,425 --> 00:49:43,526
I always questioned why I was living the way I was living.

1240
00:49:43,526 --> 00:49:44,995
- That's understandable. - Yes.

1241
00:49:44,995 --> 00:49:47,836
Do you think you traded your life with your daughter?

1242
00:49:47,836 --> 00:49:50,436
And is that why you want her to compensate you for it?

1243
00:49:50,436 --> 00:49:52,805
When I come home after drinking,

1244
00:49:52,805 --> 00:49:54,376
I resent my children.

1245
00:49:54,376 --> 00:49:55,805
- I tell them... - You had to give up your dream.

1246
00:49:55,805 --> 00:49:57,805
I tell them I had to give up my life to raise them.

1247
00:49:57,805 --> 00:49:59,776
But she didn't ask to be born.

1248
00:49:59,776 --> 00:50:01,986
- She didn't have a choice. - I know.

1249
00:50:01,986 --> 00:50:04,745
My daughter sometimes argues that.

1250
00:50:04,816 --> 00:50:06,555
And she says she doesn't know why I live like this.

1251
00:50:07,055 --> 00:50:09,026
Has your mother resented you a lot?

1252
00:50:09,055 --> 00:50:10,285
Whenever she drinks,

1253
00:50:10,686 --> 00:50:14,225
she says her life is ruined because of me.

1254
00:50:14,725 --> 00:50:17,626
- She says you ruined her life. - That's very hurtful.

1255
00:50:18,066 --> 00:50:20,535
She says things like that without filtering them.

1256
00:50:20,535 --> 00:50:21,535
(How does she feel when she hears it?)

1257
00:50:21,535 --> 00:50:23,736
How do you feel when you hear that?

1258
00:50:23,736 --> 00:50:27,405
It makes me wonder if I am actually standing in her way.

1259
00:50:27,736 --> 00:50:29,975
I even thought about that.

1260
00:50:30,146 --> 00:50:31,146
She's crying right now.

1261
00:50:32,416 --> 00:50:34,986
This is how crazy it is. It's beyond common sense.

1262
00:50:34,986 --> 00:50:37,416
- Why are you crying? - I know.

1263
00:50:37,416 --> 00:50:39,515
Does your mother treat you the same, Young Ji?

1264
00:50:39,515 --> 00:50:40,555
She's gotten emotional.

1265
00:50:40,615 --> 00:50:43,055
- Tell us about it. - I am sorry.

1266
00:50:43,356 --> 00:50:44,456
- It's just... - Is your mom...

1267
00:50:44,456 --> 00:50:47,626
- releasing a trot album? - She talks so calmly.

1268
00:50:47,825 --> 00:50:49,966
It must've broken her heart.

1269
00:50:50,026 --> 00:50:53,265
She seems very calm, but she must be...

1270
00:50:54,695 --> 00:50:57,305
- a mess inside. - She got...

1271
00:50:57,305 --> 00:50:59,236
- used to it. - Yes.

1272
00:50:59,236 --> 00:51:01,006
- She did. - She's worn off.

1273
00:51:01,006 --> 00:51:02,546
- She has to be worn off. - Yes.

1274
00:51:02,546 --> 00:51:05,716
She's not used to expressing her feelings.

1275
00:51:05,716 --> 00:51:08,075
I feel sorry for her.

1276
00:51:08,245 --> 00:51:12,456
Growing up, when was the toughest time for you?

1277
00:51:12,555 --> 00:51:14,615
It was when I was about 25 or 26.

1278
00:51:14,615 --> 00:51:16,055
- Why was it tough for you? - Why?

1279
00:51:16,055 --> 00:51:20,126
It was really tough. It was mostly because of Mom.

1280
00:51:20,195 --> 00:51:21,195
At the time,

1281
00:51:22,166 --> 00:51:24,825
I had no desire to live,

1282
00:51:24,825 --> 00:51:26,936
and I didn't go out of the house.

1283
00:51:26,936 --> 00:51:30,035
I didn't want to answer any calls, so I kept my phone turned off.

1284
00:51:30,035 --> 00:51:34,535
I didn't eat either. I lost 12kg in a week.

1285
00:51:34,535 --> 00:51:36,546
- That happens if you don't eat. - I couldn't eat.

1286
00:51:36,546 --> 00:51:37,945
It's not that I didn't want to eat. I couldn't eat.

1287
00:51:37,945 --> 00:51:39,115
How did you get over that?

1288
00:51:39,716 --> 00:51:42,546
Whenever I think about doing something bad,

1289
00:51:42,546 --> 00:51:45,515
I get worried about Mom.

1290
00:51:45,655 --> 00:51:47,486
I think she can't live without me.

1291
00:51:47,785 --> 00:51:49,925
- You're always worried about her. - Your mom is the cause,

1292
00:51:49,925 --> 00:51:51,695
- Yes, I am worried. - and she's also the drive.

1293
00:51:51,695 --> 00:51:53,356
- Yes. - Have you not known about this?

1294
00:51:53,695 --> 00:51:55,265
I thought she was on a diet.

1295
00:51:55,265 --> 00:51:57,725
(She thought her daughter was simply being on a diet.)

1296
00:51:57,725 --> 00:52:00,296
She didn't want to tell you. That's how uninterested you are in her.

1297
00:52:00,296 --> 00:52:02,566
You are so self-centered.

1298
00:52:02,566 --> 00:52:04,135
Right.

1299
00:52:04,135 --> 00:52:06,836
Since she was young,

1300
00:52:06,836 --> 00:52:09,945
we never really talked.

1301
00:52:09,945 --> 00:52:13,175
Something really upsets me, you see.

1302
00:52:13,175 --> 00:52:15,716
You don't seem sorry at all.

1303
00:52:15,716 --> 00:52:17,316
- Why is that? - Why is that?

1304
00:52:17,316 --> 00:52:20,686
I try to understand you, but I keep nearly losing my temper.

1305
00:52:20,916 --> 00:52:23,785
- You don't seem sorry at all. - I think I am an egoistic person.

1306
00:52:24,086 --> 00:52:26,195
- You think you're egoistic. - I am egoistic.

1307
00:52:26,195 --> 00:52:29,595
I had never been this frustrated while being on a TV show.

1308
00:52:29,595 --> 00:52:32,035
- It's because... - Do you have a sibling?

1309
00:52:32,035 --> 00:52:33,495
There are 13 of us.

1310
00:52:34,095 --> 00:52:36,836
- 13 children? - And I am the youngest.

1311
00:52:36,836 --> 00:52:38,736
- You're the youngest of 13. - You're the youngest of 13.

1312
00:52:38,736 --> 00:52:40,805
- Yes. - There are 13 of us.

1313
00:52:40,805 --> 00:52:43,405
- She must've been so loved. - Growing up as the youngest,

1314
00:52:43,405 --> 00:52:45,475
I was always told that I was the best and that I sing well.

1315
00:52:45,475 --> 00:52:48,515
I was always praised highly. Even after giving birth,

1316
00:52:48,515 --> 00:52:51,416
I continued to be constantly complimented.

1317
00:52:51,445 --> 00:52:54,486
And that made me selfish. I became egoistic.

1318
00:52:54,925 --> 00:52:57,186
Right. You are very self-centered.

1319
00:52:57,186 --> 00:53:00,026
How people look at you is very important to you,

1320
00:53:00,026 --> 00:53:02,466
and you want people to pay attention to you.

1321
00:53:02,466 --> 00:53:05,095
And you enjoy it immensely.

1322
00:53:05,095 --> 00:53:07,236
Meanwhile, your family is suffering a lot and going crazy.

1323
00:53:07,236 --> 00:53:08,905
Her daughter's mind is rotting away.

1324
00:53:09,006 --> 00:53:12,206
Our presenters rarely get this upset.

1325
00:53:12,206 --> 00:53:13,475
But they got upset twice today.

1326
00:53:14,135 --> 00:53:15,745
This is really tough.

1327
00:53:15,745 --> 00:53:18,075
- It's really tough. - Please pass the mic to the back.

1328
00:53:18,075 --> 00:53:20,376
This is the toughest shoot I've experienced in 27 years.

1329
00:53:20,515 --> 00:53:22,716
- Sir. - Dong Yeob is famous...

1330
00:53:22,716 --> 00:53:24,916
- Do you understand the lady? - for not showing his feelings.

1331
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:26,316
I think she deserves to be here.

1332
00:53:26,316 --> 00:53:27,316
(He thinks it's a big worry.)

1333
00:53:28,686 --> 00:53:30,885
You are just like her.

1334
00:53:31,356 --> 00:53:33,095
You are just the same.

1335
00:53:33,195 --> 00:53:35,925
- I... - Look at your wife.

1336
00:53:35,925 --> 00:53:36,925
(I give up.)

1337
00:53:36,925 --> 00:53:40,695
There must've been a reason why you decided to take it here.

1338
00:53:40,936 --> 00:53:43,006
What are you mostly worried about?

1339
00:53:43,006 --> 00:53:44,466
Mom...

1340
00:53:45,075 --> 00:53:47,836
- wants to go to Japan. - Why?

1341
00:53:47,836 --> 00:53:49,575
- Japan? - She wants to go to Japan...

1342
00:53:49,575 --> 00:53:51,345
and become a singer there.

1343
00:53:51,345 --> 00:53:52,975
Who did she meet this time?

1344
00:53:52,975 --> 00:53:54,276
Did Kang Nam convince you?

1345
00:53:55,245 --> 00:53:57,416
- Did someone tell you to... - I feel so uncomfortable.

1346
00:53:57,416 --> 00:53:59,555
Does she speak any Japanese?

1347
00:53:59,555 --> 00:54:01,885
Not at all. She has never been to Japan,

1348
00:54:01,885 --> 00:54:04,356
- and she doesn't speak Japanese. - How did you think of this idea?

1349
00:54:04,356 --> 00:54:06,555
- She's unbelievable. - Why do you want to go to Japan?

1350
00:54:06,555 --> 00:54:07,896
I want to go to Japan...

1351
00:54:08,825 --> 00:54:09,896
and sing.

1352
00:54:09,896 --> 00:54:12,436
Wait. Who told you to go there?

1353
00:54:12,436 --> 00:54:13,796
Tell us about it. I want to tell you...

1354
00:54:13,796 --> 00:54:16,805
- if your plan is feasible. - I know someone...

1355
00:54:16,805 --> 00:54:18,805
who's lived in Japan for a long time.

1356
00:54:18,805 --> 00:54:21,436
He asked me to go with him to Japan...

1357
00:54:21,436 --> 00:54:23,075
- and audition at clubs. - But...

1358
00:54:23,075 --> 00:54:25,975
you need a place to stay,

1359
00:54:25,975 --> 00:54:27,876
and you need money to spend. Will that person pay for it?

1360
00:54:27,876 --> 00:54:31,586
- I didn't ask about that. - Who would pay for that?

1361
00:54:32,615 --> 00:54:35,885
It's understandable that you want to go to Japan to chase your dream.

1362
00:54:35,885 --> 00:54:37,225
What will happen to your daughter?

1363
00:54:37,925 --> 00:54:40,555
I didn't think about that.

1364
00:54:40,796 --> 00:54:41,796
(She's really unbelievable.)

1365
00:54:41,796 --> 00:54:44,166
- Since she was young... - Why didn't you think of that?

1366
00:54:44,296 --> 00:54:45,666
- She should've... - Do you think...

1367
00:54:45,736 --> 00:54:47,566
your daughter will pay for your trip?

1368
00:54:47,566 --> 00:54:49,635
- I dropped a hint. - What?

1369
00:54:49,635 --> 00:54:51,776
- What did she say? - She dropped a hint.

1370
00:54:51,805 --> 00:54:53,836
- She dropped a hint. - I asked her...

1371
00:54:53,836 --> 00:54:54,836
if she's got any more money to lend me.

1372
00:54:55,546 --> 00:54:58,615
Don't you think you are being very irresponsible?

1373
00:54:58,615 --> 00:55:01,245
I think it will work out somehow. So I just want to do it.

1374
00:55:01,245 --> 00:55:02,615
I want to start it and see what happens.

1375
00:55:02,615 --> 00:55:04,586
- You're upset, aren't you, Tae Oh? - This is crazy.

1376
00:55:04,986 --> 00:55:07,155
I think she's very immature.

1377
00:55:07,416 --> 00:55:09,026
Right.

1378
00:55:09,456 --> 00:55:12,526
I admit that. I admit that I am immature.

1379
00:55:12,526 --> 00:55:13,796
(Her shamelessness is beyond our imagination.)

1380
00:55:14,495 --> 00:55:15,896
It must be so tough for her daughter.

1381
00:55:15,896 --> 00:55:18,666
- I've been told that I'm immature. - Some of the audience...

1382
00:55:18,695 --> 00:55:20,236
are crying.

1383
00:55:20,236 --> 00:55:21,365
What did you say?

1384
00:55:21,365 --> 00:55:22,736
I've been told that I am too immature for my age.

1385
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:26,475
Don't you think about how to become more mature?

1386
00:55:26,475 --> 00:55:27,975
That's life.

1387
00:55:29,175 --> 00:55:31,376
By any chance, did you drink before coming here?

1388
00:55:32,975 --> 00:55:35,216
It has never been this tough.

1389
00:55:35,515 --> 00:55:39,216
We can't communicate. I feel like I'm talking to a wall.

1390
00:55:39,356 --> 00:55:41,555
"You are selfish". "Yes. I am selfish."

1391
00:55:41,925 --> 00:55:43,825
- Right. - It just bounces back.

1392
00:55:43,885 --> 00:55:46,296
I want to ask you this question to make myself feel better.

1393
00:55:46,325 --> 00:55:49,865
Do you feel sorry to your daughter?

1394
00:55:50,095 --> 00:55:51,265
- Honestly. - I feel sorry.

1395
00:55:51,265 --> 00:55:53,466
- Do you feel very sorry to her? - Yes.

1396
00:55:53,466 --> 00:55:57,405
But do you have a hard time saying sorry? And do you...

1397
00:55:58,206 --> 00:55:59,736
unintentionally say mean things?

1398
00:55:59,836 --> 00:56:02,046
- Yes. - Thank goodness.

1399
00:56:02,345 --> 00:56:04,575
- I am bad at expressing myself. - I asked her that question...

1400
00:56:04,575 --> 00:56:06,316
with a thread of hope. It's because...

1401
00:56:06,546 --> 00:56:10,186
I think everyone who watches this will get disappointed and struggle.

1402
00:56:10,245 --> 00:56:12,956
You only say the most selfish things.

1403
00:56:12,956 --> 00:56:14,816
I asked you that question to try to understand your behavior.

1404
00:56:14,816 --> 00:56:17,885
Ma'am, trot music is different from regular pop music.

1405
00:56:17,885 --> 00:56:20,626
What do you need the most to sing trot?

1406
00:56:20,825 --> 00:56:22,626
- It's the emotions. - Yes.

1407
00:56:22,626 --> 00:56:24,796
You need the feeling of desperate love or sorrow.

1408
00:56:24,796 --> 00:56:26,736
When you sing,

1409
00:56:26,796 --> 00:56:28,836
it's not bad. It's technically good.

1410
00:56:28,836 --> 00:56:30,905
But it doesn't touch our heart.

1411
00:56:30,905 --> 00:56:34,305
In order to sing well, as you dearly hope to,

1412
00:56:34,336 --> 00:56:38,776
you should build a strong bond with your daughter before going to Japan.

1413
00:56:38,776 --> 00:56:43,285
I think your daughter needs your love.

1414
00:56:43,285 --> 00:56:44,716
- Yes. - That's what I think.

1415
00:56:44,716 --> 00:56:47,216
And you need to learn that emotion of love.

1416
00:56:47,216 --> 00:56:49,725
If you contain that emotion in your singing,

1417
00:56:49,785 --> 00:56:52,595
you will be able to touch more people's hearts.

1418
00:56:52,595 --> 00:56:54,356
I...

1419
00:56:54,356 --> 00:56:56,925
- Don't answer right away. - Right.

1420
00:56:56,925 --> 00:56:59,666
You should think before you give an answer.

1421
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:02,706
I eat a lot, but I wait until everything is digested.

1422
00:57:03,635 --> 00:57:05,436
- Really? - Of course.

1423
00:57:05,436 --> 00:57:08,776
What would you want to tell her before we end?

1424
00:57:08,776 --> 00:57:09,845
This is your chance.

1425
00:57:09,845 --> 00:57:12,675
I want us to be like a typical mother and daughter.

1426
00:57:12,675 --> 00:57:14,316
I want us to talk a lot.

1427
00:57:14,316 --> 00:57:16,445
You should tell her yourself.

1428
00:57:18,216 --> 00:57:21,456
- I'm not used to talking to her. - It's awkward for them.

1429
00:57:21,456 --> 00:57:23,086
I will introduce her to you. She's your mother.

1430
00:57:23,655 --> 00:57:25,095
(She should muster up her courage.)

1431
00:57:25,095 --> 00:57:26,296
"Mom."

1432
00:57:28,765 --> 00:57:33,166
Mom. From now on...

1433
00:57:38,166 --> 00:57:42,006
I won't always say no.

1434
00:57:42,276 --> 00:57:45,716
I want you to discuss things with me...

1435
00:57:46,175 --> 00:57:47,745
no matter how menial things are.

1436
00:57:47,945 --> 00:57:51,586
Don't go somewhere and give an autograph.

1437
00:57:51,586 --> 00:57:54,515
I really don't want you...

1438
00:57:55,456 --> 00:57:57,925
to go to Japan.

1439
00:57:57,986 --> 00:57:59,195
Do you love your mom?

1440
00:57:59,195 --> 00:58:01,595
I do, but I've never said it.

1441
00:58:01,595 --> 00:58:03,995
- Let's do it today. - You've never said it?

1442
00:58:07,296 --> 00:58:10,135
Mom, I love you.

1443
00:58:11,035 --> 00:58:12,575
Let's be happy.

1444
00:58:12,575 --> 00:58:14,175
(Let's be happy.)

1445
00:58:15,445 --> 00:58:18,376
All right. Let's start the voting.

1446
00:58:18,376 --> 00:58:19,475
K. will.

1447
00:58:20,245 --> 00:58:22,046
It must've been really tough for her.

1448
00:58:22,546 --> 00:58:26,186
I suddenly feel so thankful to my parents.

1449
00:58:26,186 --> 00:58:29,186
It's a worry.

1450
00:58:29,186 --> 00:58:32,595
I hope you will talk to each other a lot.

1451
00:58:32,595 --> 00:58:34,396
I also think it's a worry.

1452
00:58:34,626 --> 00:58:36,296
It's a very big worry.

1453
00:58:36,865 --> 00:58:39,666
I kept looking at her...

1454
00:58:39,666 --> 00:58:41,236
when she was talking.

1455
00:58:41,236 --> 00:58:43,936
I am so thankful...

1456
00:58:43,936 --> 00:58:47,376
because she grew as such a lovely lady.

1457
00:58:47,376 --> 00:58:50,376
Her mother should be really thankful to her...

1458
00:58:50,376 --> 00:58:51,776
for growing as a lovely lady.

1459
00:58:51,776 --> 00:58:55,586
She should give her a hug for enduring the tough times.

1460
00:58:55,586 --> 00:58:57,385
I feel so thankful to her.

1461
00:58:57,385 --> 00:59:00,486
If you sympathize with her,

1462
00:59:00,486 --> 00:59:01,756
please press the buttons.

1463
00:59:01,986 --> 00:59:03,986
(What does the audience think?)

1464
00:59:04,626 --> 00:59:10,365
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

1465
00:59:10,365 --> 00:59:11,635
- Stop. - Stop.

1466
00:59:11,865 --> 00:59:15,836
Ma'am, this is your time to tell her how you really feel.

1467
00:59:15,836 --> 00:59:18,336
I think I depended on you a lot.

1468
00:59:18,675 --> 00:59:21,876
Now whenever something happens, I will discuss it with you.

1469
00:59:22,376 --> 00:59:23,575
I am sorry.

1470
00:59:24,945 --> 00:59:26,475
And I love you, Min Hee.

1471
00:59:26,776 --> 00:59:27,876
How about Japan?

1472
00:59:29,316 --> 00:59:30,546
I won't go.

1473
00:59:31,186 --> 00:59:32,716
You won't go.

1474
00:59:38,325 --> 00:59:41,526
Ma'am, you can go to Japan,

1475
00:59:41,526 --> 00:59:44,365
but you have to do more research and go when you can afford it.

1476
00:59:44,365 --> 00:59:45,796
I won't go.

1477
00:59:45,796 --> 00:59:48,436
Don't say it like a baby.

1478
00:59:48,436 --> 00:59:50,836
- I really won't go. - Don't go. All right.

1479
00:59:50,836 --> 00:59:53,135
If you go, I will go chase after you.

1480
00:59:53,305 --> 00:59:54,535
Don't you dare go to Japan.

1481
00:59:56,245 --> 00:59:58,276
All right. Let's find out how many votes she got.

1482
00:59:58,276 --> 01:00:00,776
"Do I Look Like an ATM?" Please show us the result.

1483
01:00:00,776 --> 01:00:02,345
(The result)

1484
01:00:02,945 --> 01:00:04,345
Wouldn't it be 156?

1485
01:00:04,345 --> 01:00:05,986
- It could be more than that. 166? - Will she get one more vote?

1486
01:00:05,986 --> 01:00:07,456
It might be 166.

1487
01:00:07,456 --> 01:00:09,225
- 166. - Is it 176?

1488
01:00:09,356 --> 01:00:10,526
(She's nervous.)

1489
01:00:11,026 --> 01:00:12,055
- 176? - 166.

1490
01:00:14,155 --> 01:00:15,425
(She got 166 votes.)

1491
01:00:17,325 --> 01:00:21,195
Before I introduce the next story, I want to say this.

1492
01:00:21,195 --> 01:00:22,905
I was feeling really frustrated a while ago...

1493
01:00:22,905 --> 01:00:25,336
- because I know my story. - Right.

1494
01:00:26,006 --> 01:00:27,405
Thinking about it,

1495
01:00:27,405 --> 01:00:29,975
I think I am in a similar situation.

1496
01:00:29,975 --> 01:00:31,006
No way.

1497
01:00:31,716 --> 01:00:33,575
- Please. - What's wrong with today?

1498
01:00:33,745 --> 01:00:35,646
Why is everything so serious today?

1499
01:00:35,646 --> 01:00:37,546
It's the director's fault.

1500
01:00:37,546 --> 01:00:38,586
(It worries me.)

1501
01:00:38,956 --> 01:00:42,956
Hello. I am a housewife in her 30s...

1502
01:00:42,956 --> 01:00:44,586
who has a romantic husband.

1503
01:00:44,925 --> 01:00:47,356
When I wake up in the morning...

1504
01:00:47,356 --> 01:00:51,736
"Good morning." "O Sole Mio".

1505
01:00:51,836 --> 01:00:53,095
It's just like a while ago.

1506
01:00:54,265 --> 01:00:55,765
It's a little different. Even in the afternoon...

1507
01:00:55,765 --> 01:00:58,166
"O Sole Mio".

1508
01:00:58,236 --> 01:00:59,405
Even at night...

1509
01:00:59,405 --> 01:01:02,146
"O Sole Mio".

1510
01:01:02,146 --> 01:01:05,475
He sings Italian songs day and night.

1511
01:01:05,776 --> 01:01:08,015
It's driving me mad.

1512
01:01:08,015 --> 01:01:11,956
"This is an announcement from the management."

1513
01:01:11,956 --> 01:01:15,825
"A lot of residents are complaining about the noise."

1514
01:01:15,825 --> 01:01:17,725
"Please keep the noise down..."

1515
01:01:17,725 --> 01:01:19,626
"so that your neighbors won't suffer from the noise."

1516
01:01:19,626 --> 01:01:22,425
"My goodness. Isn't that about us?"

1517
01:01:22,526 --> 01:01:26,336
"No, it's not." "O Sole Mio".

1518
01:01:26,595 --> 01:01:29,135
He sings even on streets. What's up with people?

1519
01:01:29,365 --> 01:01:32,606
"Do you want me to sing for you?"

1520
01:01:32,606 --> 01:01:35,575
"O Sole Mio".

1521
01:01:35,575 --> 01:01:38,276
You should at least change the song.

1522
01:01:38,276 --> 01:01:40,975
He even sings to strangers.

1523
01:01:40,975 --> 01:01:42,416
What's wrong with my husband?

1524
01:01:42,416 --> 01:01:45,515
Someone please seal my husband's mouth.

1525
01:01:48,456 --> 01:01:49,986
She must've been so fed up with him.

1526
01:01:49,986 --> 01:01:52,555
- She asked us to seal his mouth. - To seal his mouth.

1527
01:01:52,555 --> 01:01:54,526
- She wants to seal his mouth. - I...

1528
01:01:54,526 --> 01:01:57,126
Let's bring her in. Please come on out.

1529
01:01:58,436 --> 01:02:00,066
(Who's worried about her husband who keeps singing Italian songs?)

1530
01:02:03,466 --> 01:02:04,975
(Sung Si Eun)

1531
01:02:04,975 --> 01:02:06,006
She sat down.

1532
01:02:08,345 --> 01:02:10,445
I will throw a straight question.

1533
01:02:10,445 --> 01:02:12,975
- Is your husband a vocalist? - Please, say yes.

1534
01:02:12,975 --> 01:02:14,845
No, he is not a vocalist.

1535
01:02:15,216 --> 01:02:18,385
- Then... - He did study vocal music.

1536
01:02:18,385 --> 01:02:19,856
- He studied it. - He studied it.

1537
01:02:19,856 --> 01:02:21,416
- Thank goodness. - I'm glad he studied it.

1538
01:02:21,416 --> 01:02:22,425
- I know. - Still...

1539
01:02:22,425 --> 01:02:24,456
He teaches children singing.

1540
01:02:24,456 --> 01:02:25,456
(He's a teacher.)

1541
01:02:25,456 --> 01:02:26,695
At least it's related to what he does for a living.

1542
01:02:27,396 --> 01:02:28,495
Is he going to release an album?

1543
01:02:28,495 --> 01:02:30,966
- Please. - Please.

1544
01:02:30,966 --> 01:02:33,296
Let me ask you that. Is he going to release an album?

1545
01:02:33,495 --> 01:02:35,436
- No. - Thank goodness.

1546
01:02:35,436 --> 01:02:36,535
Thank you.

1547
01:02:36,535 --> 01:02:38,635
Has his ligament ever been ruptured?

1548
01:02:41,675 --> 01:02:42,845
(Please forget it now.)

1549
01:02:42,845 --> 01:02:45,845
Is it a little exaggerated? Or is he really like that?

1550
01:02:45,845 --> 01:02:47,276
- Does he always sing? - Does he constantly sing?

1551
01:02:47,276 --> 01:02:50,586
From the moment he wakes up to just before going to bed,

1552
01:02:50,615 --> 01:02:53,055
he sings for more than six hours.

1553
01:02:53,486 --> 01:02:54,925
Does he sing at home?

1554
01:02:54,925 --> 01:02:56,425
- That would drive you mad. - Yes.

1555
01:02:56,425 --> 01:02:59,055
When he comes home from work,

1556
01:02:59,055 --> 01:03:02,396
I hear my husband singing in the elevator.

1557
01:03:02,396 --> 01:03:05,195
- Does he sing in the elevator? - Yes.

1558
01:03:05,195 --> 01:03:06,535
(K.will is aging quickly.)

1559
01:03:07,695 --> 01:03:09,305
I understand what it's like.

1560
01:03:09,305 --> 01:03:11,135
My father was like this.

1561
01:03:11,135 --> 01:03:12,936
My father has passed away,

1562
01:03:12,936 --> 01:03:15,876
- but he wanted to be a vocalist. - That's amazing.

1563
01:03:15,876 --> 01:03:18,675
So he sang "O Sole Mio" all the time at home.

1564
01:03:18,675 --> 01:03:20,276
- Is that why... - When he drinks,

1565
01:03:20,276 --> 01:03:23,686
- he sings it on the way home. - He sings on the way.

1566
01:03:23,686 --> 01:03:25,186
That's how we knew that he was coming home.

1567
01:03:25,186 --> 01:03:29,385
He used to sing "O Sole Mio" like that 3 or 4 times a week.

1568
01:03:29,385 --> 01:03:30,756
- It's really embarrassing. - By the way,

1569
01:03:30,756 --> 01:03:33,126
does he sing like that even when he's sober?

1570
01:03:33,126 --> 01:03:35,925
He can't drink well.

1571
01:03:37,225 --> 01:03:38,566
- And he sings like that. - He's sober.

1572
01:03:39,535 --> 01:03:41,365
- Is he always sober? - Yes.

1573
01:03:41,365 --> 01:03:43,506
By the way,

1574
01:03:43,506 --> 01:03:46,305
since he studied vocal music, he must sing quite well.

1575
01:03:46,305 --> 01:03:49,546
And since he is a vocal trainer,

1576
01:03:49,546 --> 01:03:50,675
- It must be nice to hear. - it...

1577
01:03:50,675 --> 01:03:54,316
shouldn't stress you out so much.

1578
01:03:54,316 --> 01:03:57,745
Italian songs are not very quiet.

1579
01:03:57,745 --> 01:03:59,356
When you are right next to the person singing,

1580
01:03:59,356 --> 01:04:02,486
especially when he hits high notes, my ears feel as if they're bursting.

1581
01:04:02,486 --> 01:04:04,285
It's like playing drums next to your ears.

1582
01:04:04,285 --> 01:04:06,396
Because he's always so loud,

1583
01:04:06,396 --> 01:04:08,055
our child shouts whenever he comes home.

1584
01:04:08,055 --> 01:04:09,095
(The child copies her husband.)

1585
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:12,336
And my husband scolds my child for shouting.

1586
01:04:12,336 --> 01:04:13,865
When I ask him if he can keep it down a little,

1587
01:04:13,865 --> 01:04:17,035
he says he's an understanding and considerate person.

1588
01:04:17,035 --> 01:04:19,175
He says I am being inconsiderate.

1589
01:04:19,175 --> 01:04:20,475
He's thick-faced.

1590
01:04:20,475 --> 01:04:22,245
Have you never tried telling him not to sing?

1591
01:04:22,245 --> 01:04:24,706
I tell him not to sing in a serious manner.

1592
01:04:24,706 --> 01:04:27,475
Whenever I do that, he says "Okay."

1593
01:04:27,475 --> 01:04:29,845
But when he gets inspired, he sings again.

1594
01:04:29,845 --> 01:04:32,655
I told him I couldn't...

1595
01:04:32,655 --> 01:04:35,186
live with him like this.

1596
01:04:35,186 --> 01:04:38,356
When I said that, he begged and said he wouldn't do it again.

1597
01:04:38,356 --> 01:04:41,155
- But he sings again? - Yes, he sang again after a while.

1598
01:04:41,765 --> 01:04:43,765
(Just imagining it is tough enough.)

1599
01:04:44,296 --> 01:04:47,535
There's a channel for vocal music. It's always on.

1600
01:04:47,535 --> 01:04:49,305
- He always watches that channel. - It's crazy.

1601
01:04:49,305 --> 01:04:52,075
He keeps explaining about the songs and the conductors.

1602
01:04:52,075 --> 01:04:53,535
He constantly talks about it.

1603
01:04:53,535 --> 01:04:55,345
Do you have to react when he says those?

1604
01:04:55,345 --> 01:04:56,845
Or does he not care and just goes on talking?

1605
01:04:56,845 --> 01:04:58,075
He goes on even if I don't react.

1606
01:04:58,075 --> 01:05:00,216
He must be someone who only cares about what he thinks.

1607
01:05:00,216 --> 01:05:01,986
He looks like it.

1608
01:05:02,385 --> 01:05:05,586
- Yes. - Even now,

1609
01:05:05,586 --> 01:05:08,055
he can't wait to talk.

1610
01:05:08,055 --> 01:05:09,356
He keeps nodding.

1611
01:05:09,356 --> 01:05:10,486
- He's waiting for his turn. - Yes.

1612
01:05:10,486 --> 01:05:11,995
Let's not ask him anything.

1613
01:05:12,055 --> 01:05:13,456
Let's end the shoot here.

1614
01:05:13,695 --> 01:05:15,966
Please press...

1615
01:05:16,896 --> 01:05:18,195
I almost pressed the button.

1616
01:05:19,236 --> 01:05:21,535
Let's meet her husband. Hello.

1617
01:05:21,535 --> 01:05:23,066
- Hello. - Hello.

1618
01:05:23,336 --> 01:05:24,405
His voice is good.

1619
01:05:24,405 --> 01:05:26,175
- "Hello." - "Hello."

1620
01:05:26,405 --> 01:05:28,776
This is the question we always give.

1621
01:05:28,776 --> 01:05:30,845
Do you understand your wife's concern?

1622
01:05:30,845 --> 01:05:32,376
It's true that I sing.

1623
01:05:32,376 --> 01:05:34,885
I love singing,

1624
01:05:34,885 --> 01:05:37,816
so I don't think it's a worry.

1625
01:05:37,816 --> 01:05:40,015
It's a worry for your wife, not for you.

1626
01:05:40,015 --> 01:05:41,155
Are you saying it's not a worry for your wife?

1627
01:05:41,155 --> 01:05:42,225
I don't think it's a worry.

1628
01:05:42,225 --> 01:05:44,756
You've seen the man from the first story...

1629
01:05:44,756 --> 01:05:47,256
who dances all the time...

1630
01:05:47,256 --> 01:05:49,896
and the lady who sings trot.

1631
01:05:49,896 --> 01:05:51,966
What do you think about those people?

1632
01:05:52,095 --> 01:05:55,606
I don't think there's something wrong with them.

1633
01:05:56,606 --> 01:05:58,905
They are doing what they love.

1634
01:05:58,905 --> 01:06:00,305
This is going to be tough.

1635
01:06:00,305 --> 01:06:03,075
They should be praised.

1636
01:06:03,075 --> 01:06:04,276
What's wrong with today?

1637
01:06:04,276 --> 01:06:06,046
- They're not problematic. - Is this a special?

1638
01:06:06,046 --> 01:06:09,316
Please don't say that with such a peaceful face.

1639
01:06:09,316 --> 01:06:11,655
I think K.will doesn't suit this show well.

1640
01:06:11,655 --> 01:06:13,285
Whenever he comes out,

1641
01:06:13,285 --> 01:06:14,756
- the stories are very serious. - K.will...

1642
01:06:14,756 --> 01:06:16,555
looks about three years older than when he started.

1643
01:06:16,555 --> 01:06:17,956
(This is Hello effect.)

1644
01:06:18,296 --> 01:06:19,396
You're right.

1645
01:06:19,655 --> 01:06:21,896
She said he sings on streets.

1646
01:06:21,896 --> 01:06:23,896
I heard him singing in the waiting room.

1647
01:06:24,296 --> 01:06:25,865
Was he singing in the waiting room?

1648
01:06:25,936 --> 01:06:27,936
- Didn't you hear that? - He was humming.

1649
01:06:27,936 --> 01:06:29,466
That's why it was so loud.

1650
01:06:29,765 --> 01:06:32,706
Streets, grocery store, cinema, cafe, and hospital.

1651
01:06:32,706 --> 01:06:34,336
- Cinema? - Park.

1652
01:06:34,336 --> 01:06:35,475
He sang a while ago.

1653
01:06:35,475 --> 01:06:37,146
He always sings loud.

1654
01:06:37,146 --> 01:06:38,816
When he walks on a street, there are people in front of him.

1655
01:06:38,816 --> 01:06:41,015
When he sings loudly, people turn back.

1656
01:06:41,015 --> 01:06:42,515
- Right. - He enjoys it.

1657
01:06:42,515 --> 01:06:43,745
Then he pauses.

1658
01:06:44,015 --> 01:06:46,356
When people start walking again, he sings again.

1659
01:06:46,356 --> 01:06:48,986
When they turn back, he pretends it's not him.

1660
01:06:49,225 --> 01:06:51,796
- I'm ashamed. - I can understand.

1661
01:06:52,796 --> 01:06:55,595
Why do you sing all the time?

1662
01:06:55,595 --> 01:06:58,966
I had a desire to be successful by singing,

1663
01:06:58,966 --> 01:07:03,405
but I couldn't accomplish my dream as my parents were against it,

1664
01:07:03,405 --> 01:07:05,776
so I have deep resentment.

1665
01:07:05,776 --> 01:07:09,046
I'm singing all the time to fulfill my desire.

1666
01:07:09,046 --> 01:07:12,115
Then you should sing on the stage,

1667
01:07:12,115 --> 01:07:14,376
not next to people who don't like it.

1668
01:07:14,376 --> 01:07:15,686
You can sing on the stage.

1669
01:07:15,686 --> 01:07:18,046
I do that sometimes,

1670
01:07:18,046 --> 01:07:20,615
but music is my life,

1671
01:07:20,655 --> 01:07:21,925
- so... - Music is your life?

1672
01:07:21,925 --> 01:07:23,756
- I sing all day. - Music is his life.

1673
01:07:23,756 --> 01:07:25,026
(I'll sing for you 24 hours.)

1674
01:07:26,155 --> 01:07:27,325
(It's already ringing in her ears.)

1675
01:07:27,325 --> 01:07:29,566
There are many genres in music.

1676
01:07:29,566 --> 01:07:32,865
I know you like classic, but hip hop's been popular lately.

1677
01:07:32,865 --> 01:07:34,436
How do you feel when you listen to that?

1678
01:07:35,206 --> 01:07:37,066
I'm not interested in hip hop.

1679
01:07:37,066 --> 01:07:40,035
What if your wife raps all day long...

1680
01:07:40,035 --> 01:07:41,876
when you're not interested?

1681
01:07:41,876 --> 01:07:45,015
- Connection - She keeps rapping.

1682
01:07:45,015 --> 01:07:48,015
- Then... - Yangwha bridge

1683
01:07:48,015 --> 01:07:50,015
Yangwha bridge Yangwha bridge

1684
01:07:50,015 --> 01:07:52,756
Yangwha bridge Yangwha bridge

1685
01:07:52,756 --> 01:07:54,055
You wouldn't even want to go near.

1686
01:07:54,115 --> 01:07:56,785
If she does, it's what she likes.

1687
01:07:56,785 --> 01:07:58,995
- Will you accept it? - I don't think it's a worry.

1688
01:07:58,995 --> 01:08:00,195
Your wife likes it?

1689
01:08:01,966 --> 01:08:03,325
I heard you sing in an elevator.

1690
01:08:03,325 --> 01:08:06,035
Yes. I keep singing in the elevator.

1691
01:08:06,035 --> 01:08:09,265
When people get on the elevator, I stop for a second,

1692
01:08:09,265 --> 01:08:11,166
then go down to the first floor.

1693
01:08:12,106 --> 01:08:14,175
- You go down? - I go down and if there's no one,

1694
01:08:14,175 --> 01:08:17,506
I sing again as I go up to my house.

1695
01:08:17,605 --> 01:08:19,176
It rings.

1696
01:08:19,176 --> 01:08:21,315
- It feels great. - Do you sing looking in the mirror?

1697
01:08:21,586 --> 01:08:23,185
Yes, I do.

1698
01:08:23,185 --> 01:08:25,685
Even if you sing in the elevator,

1699
01:08:25,685 --> 01:08:27,886
aren't you aware that the other houses can hear you?

1700
01:08:29,285 --> 01:08:32,155
It's a common sense. I'm aware of it,

1701
01:08:32,155 --> 01:08:34,126
- but I don't care since I like it. - My gosh.

1702
01:08:34,926 --> 01:08:38,065
Before my debut,

1703
01:08:38,435 --> 01:08:41,706
when I wanted to be a singer, I didn't have a place to practice.

1704
01:08:41,706 --> 01:08:43,306
I wanted to practice so badly,

1705
01:08:43,306 --> 01:08:46,136
so I used to sing under the bridge in Jungnangcheon.

1706
01:08:46,235 --> 01:08:48,575
Then there was a big road, I sang in the middle of it.

1707
01:08:48,575 --> 01:08:50,476
- Right. - That's what I did.

1708
01:08:50,506 --> 01:08:52,376
You shouldn't sing in the apartment.

1709
01:08:52,376 --> 01:08:55,985
- That's noise pollution. - There was even an announcement.

1710
01:08:55,985 --> 01:09:00,216
Even if there was an announcement, people can't say it's me.

1711
01:09:00,956 --> 01:09:03,025
(They don't know what to say.)

1712
01:09:04,525 --> 01:09:06,796
You said you're rational and considerate,

1713
01:09:06,855 --> 01:09:09,065
but think about it. It's okay when you don't mind it,

1714
01:09:09,065 --> 01:09:11,596
- but your wife doesn't like it. - Yes.

1715
01:09:11,596 --> 01:09:15,435
You should stop since your wife's getting stressed.

1716
01:09:15,435 --> 01:09:16,605
- Right. - If you're considerate.

1717
01:09:16,605 --> 01:09:19,506
- I feel sorry for her. - It's not like you live alone.

1718
01:09:19,506 --> 01:09:21,806
I reflect on myself too,

1719
01:09:21,806 --> 01:09:25,546
but what is learned in the cradle is carried to the tomb.

1720
01:09:25,546 --> 01:09:27,016
Are you saying you'll do it until you die?

1721
01:09:27,676 --> 01:09:30,785
Why did you describe yourself rational and considerate?

1722
01:09:30,785 --> 01:09:33,315
This isn't rational or considerate.

1723
01:09:33,315 --> 01:09:34,855
You're inconsistent.

1724
01:09:34,855 --> 01:09:36,426
- You're not considerate at all. - I agree.

1725
01:09:36,426 --> 01:09:38,296
- Selfish. - It's not right.

1726
01:09:38,596 --> 01:09:40,426
- What? - The lady next to him...

1727
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:41,865
just said, "He's selfish."

1728
01:09:41,865 --> 01:09:43,995
I got goosebumps.

1729
01:09:44,296 --> 01:09:47,035
Selfish people recognize each other.

1730
01:09:47,035 --> 01:09:49,306
- Did she say he's selfish? - Yes. Just now.

1731
01:09:49,306 --> 01:09:51,136
Is there anyone who likes it?

1732
01:09:51,306 --> 01:09:53,405
When there are many people, he needs to sing together,

1733
01:09:53,405 --> 01:09:55,745
- but his voice stands out. - In the choir?

1734
01:09:55,976 --> 01:09:57,676
It'd make sense if he's in a choir.

1735
01:09:57,676 --> 01:09:59,075
Oh, when he just sings.

1736
01:09:59,075 --> 01:10:01,115
- Yes. When he just sings. - Alone?

1737
01:10:01,115 --> 01:10:02,216
Some people do that.

1738
01:10:02,216 --> 01:10:04,285
So people come to me, and say quietly,

1739
01:10:04,285 --> 01:10:07,216
"Your husband's too loud."

1740
01:10:07,216 --> 01:10:10,285
He's showing off...

1741
01:10:10,285 --> 01:10:12,126
- in public. - Right.

1742
01:10:12,695 --> 01:10:16,995
When I invite someone to my house, or when I'm invited,

1743
01:10:17,195 --> 01:10:20,195
he suddenly gets ready.

1744
01:10:20,195 --> 01:10:21,565
When we're having a conversation,

1745
01:10:21,565 --> 01:10:24,865
he asks the guests, "Would you mind if I sing for you?"

1746
01:10:25,136 --> 01:10:27,676
The guests can't possibly say no.

1747
01:10:27,676 --> 01:10:28,706
- Right. - Right.

1748
01:10:28,706 --> 01:10:30,905
They can't say, "I'm sorry, but no."

1749
01:10:31,176 --> 01:10:32,876
"No."

1750
01:10:32,876 --> 01:10:35,016
If I was there, I probably said no.

1751
01:10:35,685 --> 01:10:39,886
Then he sings 3 or 4 songs.

1752
01:10:39,886 --> 01:10:43,086
I'm worried about the complaints from the neighbors,

1753
01:10:43,086 --> 01:10:46,995
and what the guests would think.

1754
01:10:47,195 --> 01:10:49,766
Is it because of your resentment?

1755
01:10:49,766 --> 01:10:52,565
Other people's goal is to release an album.

1756
01:10:52,565 --> 01:10:56,336
I want to perform in front of Europeans as an Asian.

1757
01:10:56,336 --> 01:11:00,806
I also want to perform in Seoul Arts Center.

1758
01:11:00,806 --> 01:11:03,346
Are you going to release an album if you get to perform?

1759
01:11:03,976 --> 01:11:07,075
If I get a chance, I'll start working on it.

1760
01:11:07,145 --> 01:11:09,886
If you still want to be an opera singer,

1761
01:11:10,046 --> 01:11:13,115
you can stop bothering other people and get a practice room.

1762
01:11:13,115 --> 01:11:14,685
Right. Why would you do that at home?

1763
01:11:14,685 --> 01:11:17,155
I want to show people,

1764
01:11:17,155 --> 01:11:20,096
and let them hear me.

1765
01:11:20,325 --> 01:11:24,226
It'd make sense if he's practicing...

1766
01:11:24,226 --> 01:11:26,895
to perform in a bigger stage,

1767
01:11:26,966 --> 01:11:28,836
but that's not what he wants to do.

1768
01:11:28,836 --> 01:11:31,435
He wants to sing in front of people.

1769
01:11:31,435 --> 01:11:32,605
- He wants to show them. - He wants to show off.

1770
01:11:32,605 --> 01:11:34,976
He wants to enjoy people's reaction.

1771
01:11:34,976 --> 01:11:36,506
The two things...

1772
01:11:36,506 --> 01:11:38,206
- Coexist? - coexist.

1773
01:11:38,716 --> 01:11:40,315
We saw his dance.

1774
01:11:40,575 --> 01:11:41,785
Please come to the stage.

1775
01:11:41,785 --> 01:11:43,145
(Let's listen to your singing.)

1776
01:11:43,985 --> 01:11:45,586
(We don't want to hear it, but we will.)

1777
01:11:46,556 --> 01:11:48,485
("O sole mio")

1778
01:11:48,485 --> 01:11:49,726
Look at his pose.

1779
01:11:51,426 --> 01:11:52,426
(She looks like she heard it million times already.)

1780
01:12:08,775 --> 01:12:09,775
He's actually good.

1781
01:12:16,985 --> 01:12:17,985
(My ears.)

1782
01:12:19,056 --> 01:12:20,086
(Oh, my ears.)

1783
01:12:46,476 --> 01:12:48,846
(The evaluation is up to them.)

1784
01:12:49,016 --> 01:12:50,445
Do you have any other worries?

1785
01:12:50,685 --> 01:12:54,115
He often watches concerts.

1786
01:12:54,115 --> 01:12:56,185
- To watch? - Yes.

1787
01:12:56,185 --> 01:12:58,895
He's there for the rehearsal instead of the actual concert.

1788
01:12:59,195 --> 01:13:02,426
He wants me to go with him for the rehearsal.

1789
01:13:02,426 --> 01:13:04,495
- He wants to go with you. - Yes.

1790
01:13:04,495 --> 01:13:05,895
Everyone's busy in the waiting room.

1791
01:13:05,895 --> 01:13:06,935
Right. Because they have to get ready.

1792
01:13:06,935 --> 01:13:10,006
But he goes off and introduces me...

1793
01:13:10,006 --> 01:13:11,575
- and my daughter to them. - My goodness.

1794
01:13:12,006 --> 01:13:13,836
Do you really think that's necessary?

1795
01:13:13,976 --> 01:13:17,306
Since I love singing, I get vicarious satisfaction.

1796
01:13:17,306 --> 01:13:20,815
I want to be a great professor like them at music college.

1797
01:13:20,815 --> 01:13:22,485
Why would you bring your wife?

1798
01:13:22,485 --> 01:13:24,645
I want to take my wife with me...

1799
01:13:24,645 --> 01:13:26,916
and introduce her to the masters.

1800
01:13:26,916 --> 01:13:29,556
- But why? - She doesn't like it.

1801
01:13:29,556 --> 01:13:31,855
Even though she doesn't like it...

1802
01:13:31,855 --> 01:13:34,895
Your wife doesn't like it, and those people aren't interested.

1803
01:13:34,895 --> 01:13:38,895
- But I do that because I like it. - Gosh.

1804
01:13:38,895 --> 01:13:39,935
He's selfish.

1805
01:13:41,136 --> 01:13:43,365
Don't you think you're beyond selfish?

1806
01:13:43,806 --> 01:13:45,706
I do,

1807
01:13:45,876 --> 01:13:48,605
but rather than doing it alone,

1808
01:13:48,605 --> 01:13:52,615
food tastes better when we share it.

1809
01:13:52,615 --> 01:13:54,275
But it's bad food.

1810
01:13:54,315 --> 01:13:56,485
- What about your wife? - Your wife thinks it's bad food.

1811
01:13:56,485 --> 01:13:58,086
- She has no choice since I like it. - My goodness.

1812
01:13:58,086 --> 01:13:59,115
(She has no choice since I like it.)

1813
01:14:01,756 --> 01:14:04,626
What do you hate the most among what your husband forces you?

1814
01:14:04,785 --> 01:14:06,796
When we go on a trip,

1815
01:14:06,796 --> 01:14:09,596
he sings songs about the place we go,

1816
01:14:09,596 --> 01:14:14,035
and he wants me to film it.

1817
01:14:14,035 --> 01:14:15,565
- Pardon me? - Film it.

1818
01:14:15,565 --> 01:14:17,266
He wants to record himself singing?

1819
01:14:17,266 --> 01:14:19,506
- He wants to remember it. - Do you do it for him?

1820
01:14:19,506 --> 01:14:21,575
Let's watch the video.

1821
01:14:21,706 --> 01:14:22,976
Did you really film that?

1822
01:14:24,075 --> 01:14:25,176
He asked his wife to film it.

1823
01:14:25,176 --> 01:14:26,176
(Next to water)

1824
01:14:26,176 --> 01:14:32,016
(Ship on the way to Gangneung to greet the moon)

1825
01:14:33,586 --> 01:14:35,386
He sings this song when he goes there.

1826
01:14:35,825 --> 01:14:37,185
In Gangneung?

1827
01:14:37,185 --> 01:14:38,185
(Thousand years of Silla)

1828
01:14:38,185 --> 01:14:39,195
- Gyeongju. - Gyeongju.

1829
01:14:39,855 --> 01:14:41,796
(In front of ancient tombs in Gyeongju)

1830
01:14:46,435 --> 01:14:48,405
I've only heard a few songs, but I'm getting sick of it already.

1831
01:14:48,565 --> 01:14:50,706
I'm sure she's pretty stressed to listen to it all day.

1832
01:14:50,706 --> 01:14:54,075
Even when we were on honeymoon, every time he saw a European,

1833
01:14:54,336 --> 01:14:57,445
he'd sing a song from their country.

1834
01:14:57,706 --> 01:15:00,176
Then I'd stand alone and record it.

1835
01:15:00,176 --> 01:15:03,046
You recorded it? You're like a camerawoman.

1836
01:15:03,046 --> 01:15:06,685
I've always wanted to...

1837
01:15:06,685 --> 01:15:09,056
perform in Europe,

1838
01:15:09,056 --> 01:15:12,426
so when I see Europeans, I sing Italian songs,

1839
01:15:12,426 --> 01:15:13,926
and I feel satisfied from it.

1840
01:15:14,495 --> 01:15:16,426
What kind of songs do you like, ma'am?

1841
01:15:17,065 --> 01:15:18,966
I don't like any songs.

1842
01:15:18,966 --> 01:15:20,596
She doesn't like any songs. This is what happens.

1843
01:15:20,766 --> 01:15:22,405
- You make her hate it. - This is what happened to them.

1844
01:15:22,405 --> 01:15:24,706
They are unable to communicate.

1845
01:15:24,706 --> 01:15:27,075
"I like it, so she has no choice."

1846
01:15:27,075 --> 01:15:29,745
They're unable to communicate. It's one way.

1847
01:15:30,006 --> 01:15:33,976
Your wife's stressed because you force her.

1848
01:15:33,976 --> 01:15:36,645
It's not communication. She's in pain.

1849
01:15:37,185 --> 01:15:41,386
My husband made breakfast for me on the weekend,

1850
01:15:41,386 --> 01:15:44,126
but I was tired, and I wanted to sleep in more.

1851
01:15:44,285 --> 01:15:45,796
Bu he forces me to wake up,

1852
01:15:45,796 --> 01:15:47,495
- You have to eat. - and make me eat.

1853
01:15:47,495 --> 01:15:49,296
- With him? - Yes.

1854
01:15:49,296 --> 01:15:52,266
So I tell him I want to sleep for more,

1855
01:15:52,296 --> 01:15:54,636
but he says I must eat before it gets cold.

1856
01:15:54,935 --> 01:15:57,766
Also, if he peels some fruit for me,

1857
01:15:58,006 --> 01:16:01,035
but if I tell him I don't want to eat it,

1858
01:16:01,575 --> 01:16:03,306
he'd ask me why I don't want to eat it.

1859
01:16:03,306 --> 01:16:06,916
- He peeled it. - He forces me to eat it.

1860
01:16:07,945 --> 01:16:10,285
Why do you force her to eat it?

1861
01:16:10,285 --> 01:16:15,056
I have a desire to share everything with my wife.

1862
01:16:15,086 --> 01:16:16,825
That's why.

1863
01:16:16,825 --> 01:16:18,426
That's not love. You're forcing her.

1864
01:16:18,426 --> 01:16:20,855
He'd smile like that and force you to eat it, right?

1865
01:16:21,495 --> 01:16:22,766
That'd be so scary in the morning.

1866
01:16:22,926 --> 01:16:25,796
Why did you marry your husband?

1867
01:16:25,995 --> 01:16:29,136
That's one of the types you find very stressful.

1868
01:16:29,136 --> 01:16:31,506
- He's very unique. - What did you like about him?

1869
01:16:31,676 --> 01:16:33,806
Say something appropriate for the show.

1870
01:16:33,806 --> 01:16:35,006
(Something appropriate for the show)

1871
01:16:35,006 --> 01:16:36,046
Tell me one thing please.

1872
01:16:36,905 --> 01:16:40,075
He's very loving...

1873
01:16:40,075 --> 01:16:41,685
Right. That makes sense.

1874
01:16:41,685 --> 01:16:44,185
But after you married him, what did you think of his love?

1875
01:16:44,185 --> 01:16:46,056
- It's selfish love. - It's one way.

1876
01:16:46,056 --> 01:16:47,416
Yes.

1877
01:16:47,655 --> 01:16:49,155
We know that he has a warm heart,

1878
01:16:49,155 --> 01:16:52,126
but his way of expressing his feelings is wrong.

1879
01:16:52,126 --> 01:16:54,426
- He's the same person you fell for. - I know.

1880
01:16:54,426 --> 01:16:57,495
What about him worries you the most?

1881
01:16:57,495 --> 01:16:59,895
As you can see now, my husband...

1882
01:16:59,895 --> 01:17:03,206
thinks about singing all day long every day.

1883
01:17:03,565 --> 01:17:05,575
If he's that passionate about it,

1884
01:17:05,575 --> 01:17:07,376
I think he should give it a go,

1885
01:17:07,376 --> 01:17:10,876
and study overseas to learn more about it.

1886
01:17:10,876 --> 01:17:12,145
Where will he go? Japan?

1887
01:17:13,016 --> 01:17:15,445
- He should go to Italy. - Yes. To Europe.

1888
01:17:15,445 --> 01:17:17,315
If he fails to build a singing career,

1889
01:17:17,315 --> 01:17:20,685
we can come back to Korea and start from scratch again.

1890
01:17:20,685 --> 01:17:22,956
- She's willing to support him. - Yes, I am.

1891
01:17:22,956 --> 01:17:24,285
- You're so cool. - Well,

1892
01:17:24,285 --> 01:17:25,395
- that's what I think. - I see.

1893
01:17:25,395 --> 01:17:28,266
So I suggested that he should give it a try,

1894
01:17:28,266 --> 01:17:31,966
- but he's worried about his age, - Why?

1895
01:17:31,966 --> 01:17:36,136
and about leaving his parents alone in Korea.

1896
01:17:36,136 --> 01:17:38,166
He wants to be a filial son at the same time?

1897
01:17:38,166 --> 01:17:39,435
Why did you refuse to do that?

1898
01:17:39,435 --> 01:17:42,306
- Your wife is so supportive. - I know. I have...

1899
01:17:42,306 --> 01:17:43,876
many different reasons.

1900
01:17:43,876 --> 01:17:46,416
As I'm not so young,

1901
01:17:46,416 --> 01:17:50,245
I'm not very confident.

1902
01:17:50,245 --> 01:17:54,815
Also, it's not an easy decision to move to Europe...

1903
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:56,785
- with my wife and child. - Then, you should change your mind.

1904
01:17:56,785 --> 01:17:58,695
- You should give up on your dream. - I don't...

1905
01:17:58,695 --> 01:17:59,796
I don't want to do that.

1906
01:17:59,796 --> 01:18:01,596
(He's stubborn, but not driven.)

1907
01:18:02,466 --> 01:18:06,636
You insist on singing your favorite song in front of her.

1908
01:18:06,636 --> 01:18:10,605
Even when she's not in the mood, you force her to hear you sing.

1909
01:18:10,605 --> 01:18:14,636
However, you never accepted her offer.

1910
01:18:14,636 --> 01:18:17,445
I do feel sorry.

1911
01:18:17,445 --> 01:18:20,615
So I pray every single night,

1912
01:18:20,615 --> 01:18:24,216
and reflect on myself, but in the morning, I do the same thing.

1913
01:18:24,216 --> 01:18:27,916
(I do the same thing next morning.)

1914
01:18:27,916 --> 01:18:33,195
I keep telling me to put myself in her shoes and fix my problems.

1915
01:18:33,195 --> 01:18:35,226
You think of it, but you never put that thought into action.

1916
01:18:35,226 --> 01:18:37,395
Wouldn't it be nice if you two could exchange your thoughts?

1917
01:18:37,395 --> 01:18:39,895
When your wife suggests something, you say, "Oh, right. I get it."

1918
01:18:39,895 --> 01:18:42,006
"I'll try harder. Did I do that again? I'm sorry."

1919
01:18:42,006 --> 01:18:43,336
"I can't seem to fix this problem."

1920
01:18:43,336 --> 01:18:46,006
Instead of praying at night and forgetting that in the morning,

1921
01:18:46,006 --> 01:18:48,476
pray every morning to help you not repeat the same mistakes.

1922
01:18:48,645 --> 01:18:49,676
It'd be better to pray in the morning.

1923
01:18:49,676 --> 01:18:52,176
Actually, he's so sly in a sense.

1924
01:18:52,176 --> 01:18:55,685
He doesn't block his ears. He pretends to listen to what she says.

1925
01:18:55,685 --> 01:18:58,185
- Whenever she talks to him, - That's right.

1926
01:18:58,185 --> 01:19:00,615
he pretends to hear her out, but he never changes his mind.

1927
01:19:00,615 --> 01:19:01,956
That's a really bad thing.

1928
01:19:01,956 --> 01:19:03,226
(It's hard if you keep insisting even with a smile.)

1929
01:19:03,226 --> 01:19:05,825
Tell him what you want from him.

1930
01:19:05,825 --> 01:19:07,355
Tell him everything.

1931
01:19:07,355 --> 01:19:10,325
Honey, I think you have a talent,

1932
01:19:10,926 --> 01:19:12,966
and it's rare to have it.

1933
01:19:12,966 --> 01:19:15,336
I also believe you're talented enough...

1934
01:19:15,336 --> 01:19:18,136
to perform on stage in Europe.

1935
01:19:18,136 --> 01:19:20,676
I hope you will relieve your desire in the right direction...

1936
01:19:20,676 --> 01:19:25,315
so you can develop your talent and build your own career.

1937
01:19:25,315 --> 01:19:26,376
Be brave.

1938
01:19:26,716 --> 01:19:28,645
- She's such a cool wife. - That was a great comment.

1939
01:19:28,645 --> 01:19:31,245
- She must love him deeply. - My goodness.

1940
01:19:32,756 --> 01:19:35,185
- Young Ji, let's start with you. - Okay.

1941
01:19:35,185 --> 01:19:37,155
I don't think it's a worry...

1942
01:19:37,155 --> 01:19:40,825
because he has such a great wife.

1943
01:19:40,825 --> 01:19:44,565
I think he can resolve this through communicating with her.

1944
01:19:44,565 --> 01:19:46,035
I don't think it's a worry.

1945
01:19:46,035 --> 01:19:48,365
- Kang Nam. - Oh, no. I didn't...

1946
01:19:48,365 --> 01:19:50,735
- I'm sorry. - You thought it was a worry inside.

1947
01:19:50,735 --> 01:19:52,435
She thought to herself that it's a worry.

1948
01:19:52,435 --> 01:19:53,806
Young Ji may have said cheerful comments,

1949
01:19:53,806 --> 01:19:56,506
- but she actually hated him. - She thinks it's a worry.

1950
01:19:56,506 --> 01:19:58,006
She pressed the button unconsciously.

1951
01:19:58,006 --> 01:19:59,275
She tried to maintain her public image.

1952
01:19:59,275 --> 01:20:02,145
We heard three different stories. All of them made me realize...

1953
01:20:02,145 --> 01:20:05,355
that I shouldn't let my hobby cause any trouble...

1954
01:20:05,355 --> 01:20:06,485
for my family.

1955
01:20:06,485 --> 01:20:08,226
- You pronounced "hobby" wrong. - Hobby.

1956
01:20:08,226 --> 01:20:10,285
I think this is a worry too.

1957
01:20:10,285 --> 01:20:13,226
I still don't think it's a worry.

1958
01:20:13,226 --> 01:20:17,726
If you really love your wife, you should start refraining yourself...

1959
01:20:17,726 --> 01:20:19,336
as your wife wants.

1960
01:20:19,336 --> 01:20:20,495
I...

1961
01:20:20,495 --> 01:20:23,006
won't press the button to keep myself in a good mood.

1962
01:20:23,466 --> 01:20:24,976
(K.will doesn't think it's a worry.)

1963
01:20:24,976 --> 01:20:27,535
If you have just a little self control,

1964
01:20:27,535 --> 01:20:29,645
- That's right. - I think it can be resolved.

1965
01:20:29,645 --> 01:20:33,016
If you think it's a worry, please press the button.

1966
01:20:33,615 --> 01:20:35,546
(What does the audience think?)

1967
01:20:35,546 --> 01:20:40,615
- 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. - 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

1968
01:20:40,615 --> 01:20:41,855
- Stop. - Time's up.

1969
01:20:42,126 --> 01:20:45,525
Say a word to your wife for the last time.

1970
01:20:45,525 --> 01:20:50,426
I would like to apologize to her once again.

1971
01:20:50,426 --> 01:20:52,995
Also, I promise that I will try to refrain myself...

1972
01:20:52,995 --> 01:20:56,865
so her worries can be resolved.

1973
01:20:56,865 --> 01:20:57,865
Thank you.

1974
01:21:00,105 --> 01:21:02,645
What should you do when she says she wants to sleep instead of eating?

1975
01:21:02,645 --> 01:21:04,206
- I should let her sleep. - That's right.

1976
01:21:04,206 --> 01:21:06,546
Is there anything you want him to stop doing?

1977
01:21:06,546 --> 01:21:08,685
I want him to stop singing in front of our baby...

1978
01:21:08,685 --> 01:21:11,516
because our baby is stressed out because of that.

1979
01:21:11,516 --> 01:21:13,516
- It's because he's loud. - No wonder she's a mother.

1980
01:21:13,516 --> 01:21:17,285
Do you think you can stop singing in front of your baby?

1981
01:21:17,285 --> 01:21:19,025
Yes, I'll keep my promise.

1982
01:21:19,025 --> 01:21:21,766
Let's see how many votes she got.

1983
01:21:21,766 --> 01:21:23,365
Please show us the result.

1984
01:21:23,365 --> 01:21:25,336
(The result)

1985
01:21:25,336 --> 01:21:27,666
The current winner got 166 votes.

1986
01:21:31,065 --> 01:21:32,836
(What could be the result?)

1987
01:21:33,806 --> 01:21:35,346
- Okay. - She got 92 votes.

1988
01:21:36,006 --> 01:21:37,105
(She got 92 votes.)

1989
01:21:37,775 --> 01:21:40,745
This week's winner is "Do I Look Like an ATM?"

1990
01:21:41,745 --> 01:21:44,386
We will give you a prize. Congratulations!

1991
01:21:44,386 --> 01:21:46,586
Until the day we are all worry-free...

1992
01:21:46,586 --> 01:21:48,115
Hello will continue to counsel you.

1993
01:21:48,115 --> 01:21:49,855
- Thank you! - Thank you!
