1
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,360
* Going... *

2
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,040
* Where it says
keep off the grass *

3
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:55,280
* Isn't recommended
for the very old *

4
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,040
* But when you're young
and you're in love *

5
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,640
* The world is beautiful *

6
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:10,520
* And I'm not a bit afraid
of you catching cold *

7
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,600
* Running barefoot
through the park *

8
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,200
* Searching bareheaded
in the rain *

9
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,320
* For a midwinter daisy *

10
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,800
* Seems kind of crazy
to do *

11
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,920
* But come along,
my barefoot love *

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,720
* To the fields
that shine with spring *

13
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,480
We just got married!

14
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,680
* Though it's 10 below *

15
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:40,360
* Let me go knee-deep
in daisies with you *

16
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,680
* La la la... *

17
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,000
They just got married.

18
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:49,560
* La la la
la la la la *

19
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:57,320
* La la la la la la

24
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,920
Whoa!

25
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,200
This is the Plaza Hotel,
please.

26
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,320
Plaza.

27
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,760
Corie, it's the Plaza.

28
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,520
Wait a minute.
I'm not finished.

29
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,000
Corie, the man
is waiting.

30
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,440
Give him a big tip.

31
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,320
Paul, tell me you're not sorry
we got married.

32
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,760
After 40 minutes?

33
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,640
Let's give it
a couple of hours first.

34
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,560
If the honeymoon
doesn't work out,

35
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,000
let's not get divorced.

36
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,440
Let's kill each other.

37
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,360
Let's have
a maid do it.

38
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,280
I hear the service
here's wonderful.

39
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,120
Uh...

40
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,360
Here's...

41
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,960
Thank you.

42
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,080
Come on.

43
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,800
Good afternoon.

44
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,600
Yes.

45
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,000
My hand.
I need my hand.

46
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,040
"Mr. Paul Bratter. "

47
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,160
Yes.

48
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,160
Is Mrs. Bratter
staying with you?

49
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,600
My mother?

50
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,040
Oh! Mrs. Bratter, yes.

51
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,440
Mr. And Mrs. Bratter.

52
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,960
How long will you
be staying with us, Mr. Bratter?

53
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,080
Six days.

54
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,200
And nights.

55
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,560
It's a pleasure
to have you at the Plaza.

56
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,600
449.

57
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,160
Ha ha ha!

58
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,280
Come on.
Corie, let's stop.

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,400
This way, please.

60
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,800
Ex-excuse me.
Excuse us, please.

61
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,640
Mr. Adams, I hope you realize
I'm only 15 years old.

62
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,040
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.

63
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,480
They're so stuffy
around here.

64
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,360
Is this what life
is going to be like

65
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,800
for the next
50 years?

66
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,160
Is that all we're going
to be married, 50 years?

67
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,600
That's not very long.

68
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,040
Wait. Don't make
rash judgments.

69
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,400
I think I'm going
to be a lousy wife.

70
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,840
Don't be angry with me.

71
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,760
I love you very much,

72
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,200
and I'm very sexy.

73
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,640
Then let's go inside.

74
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,560
I'm paying $30 a day.

75
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,440
O.K., Paul,
let's start the marriage.

76
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,320
Good luck, Paul.

77
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,000
Good luck, Corie.

78
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,640
Forget it. They're
never coming out.

79
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,560
How long
has it been now?

80
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,680
Five days.

81
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,080
Whew! That must be
a hotel record.

82
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,520
For a political
convention.

83
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,920
A honeymoon record
is nine days.

84
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,320
Wait a minute, Paul!

85
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,760
Where are you going?

86
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,680
Work.
I have to go to work.

87
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,560
I don't do this
for a living, you know.

88
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,000
Can't you call in sick?

89
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,840
I am sick,
but I have to go.

90
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,720
Last night you promised
you'd never leave me.

91
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,160
It's just till 5:30.

92
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,520
If it's a good marriage,
it'll last until 5:30.

93
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,600
See ya.

94
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,720
Tonight, hey?

95
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,240
What was that?

96
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,840
A kiss?

97
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,760
Would you get inside?
It's a nice hotel.

98
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,240
Was that a kiss?

99
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,120
If that's what kisses
are going to be like,

100
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,880
don't bother coming back
at 5:30.

101
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,320
I can't kiss you
anymore.

102
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,600
My lips are numb.
Now will you please go inside.

103
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,480
If you don't give me
a real kiss,

104
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,880
I'm going to give you back
your pajamas.

105
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,200
Right now.

106
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,160
N...

107
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,280
W...

108
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,400
Wait!

109
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,240
Couldn't you
make it 4:30?

110
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,360
Ahem!

111
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,480
Oh!

112
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,600
Tonight.

113
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,040
At the new apartment.

114
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,400
It's 49 West 10th Street.

115
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,880
I love you!

116
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,960
Yeah. Uh.

117
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,800
Thank you, Mr. Dooley.

118
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,480
Next time
you're in New York,

119
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,640
just call me up.

120
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,200
Hello?

121
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,640
Bratter?

122
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,880
Up here, top floor!

123
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,600
Top floor.

124
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,040
Take your time!

125
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,880
Yeah.

126
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,480
Top floor.

127
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,480
It's always
the top floor.

128
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,000
Whatever happened
to elevators?

129
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,840
Let's see.
The bed is 6 feet long

130
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,240
and the room
is 51/2 feet

131
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,240
and I'm in big trouble.

132
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,680
Tele...

133
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,920
Hi. Teleph...

134
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,160
Telephone company.

135
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,280
The phone?

136
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,400
Yeah.

137
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,240
Oh, great!
Come on in.

138
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,160
That's... that's
quite a climb.

139
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,520
Yes. Five flights,
if you don't count the front stoop.

140
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,440
Yeah, I counted
the front stoop.

141
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,320
Uh, would you like
a glass of water?

142
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,440
Please.

143
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,840
I'd offer you soda
or a beer,

144
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,760
but we don't have
anything yet.

145
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,200
A glass
of water's fine.

146
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,880
Except we don't have
any glasses either.

147
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,680
Oh.

148
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,120
You could, uh...

149
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,320
put your head under
and just schlurp.

150
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,200
Oh, no, I don't have
enough breath to slurp.

151
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,520
Well...

152
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,640
Where would you
like the phone?

153
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,640
Gee, uh...

154
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,080
I don't know.

155
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,520
Any suggestions?

156
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,960
Well, it all depends

157
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,840
on what you're going
to do with the room.

158
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,240
You going to have
furniture in here?

159
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,360
Ha!

160
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,640
Sure.

161
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,520
Listen, you can give me
a long extension cord,

162
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,360
and I'll carry it around with me
the first few years.

163
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,680
Good. I'll use
the old connection.

164
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,600
Whew!

165
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,480
You're really going
to live up here, huh?

166
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,520
I mean every day.

167
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,120
Every day.

168
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,440
I hope that's the men
with the furniture.

169
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,560
I don't want to see this.

170
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,800
Hello, Bloomingdale's!

171
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,800
Lord & Taylor's.

172
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,920
Oh.

173
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,160
Up here, top floor!

174
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,160
Oh, my God.

175
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,840
It's probably another wedding gift
from my mother.

176
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,520
She sends wedding gifts
twice a day.

177
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,560
I hope it's
an electric heater.

178
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,360
Is it cold in here?

179
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,800
I can't grip the phone.

180
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,440
Maybe the steam is off.

181
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,880
Maybe that's it.

182
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,320
Just turn it on.

183
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,000
It'll come right up.

184
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,400
It is on.

185
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,680
It's just not
coming up.

186
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,800
Oh.

187
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,400
Your husband have
a lot of sweaters?

188
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,840
I prefer it this way.

189
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,560
It's a medical fact
that steam heat's bad for you.

190
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,520
Yeah? In February?

191
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,040
Just put them down
anywhere.

192
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,800
I know. I know.

193
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,080
Oh, I'm terribly sorry
about the stairs.

194
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,080
I think he wants you
to sign it.

195
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,200
Oh.

196
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,120
Oh, wait a minute.

197
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,640
There you are.

198
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,040
Are you going
to be all right?

199
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,080
That's a shame,

200
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,960
giving a job like that
to an old man.

201
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,400
He's probably
only 25.

202
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,320
They age fast
on this route.

203
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,240
O.K., lady,
you're in business.

204
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,040
My own phone.

205
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,960
Can I make
a call yet?

206
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,880
Your bill started
two minutes ago.

207
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,320
Who can I call?

208
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,200
Oh, by the way,
my name is Harry Pepper.

209
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,120
If you ever have
phone trouble,

210
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,480
do me a favor...
don't ask for Harry Pepper.

211
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,880
What's the matter,
bad news?

212
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,240
It's going to be cloudy tonight
with a light snow.

213
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,640
You'll be the first
in the city

214
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,080
to see it fall.

215
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,440
Hello, is Mr. Paul Bratter
there, please?

216
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,360
This is Mrs. Paul Bratter
calling.

217
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,960
This is terrific.
It works just great.

218
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,520
Just like
a real phone, huh?

219
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,840
Frank, is Paul there?

220
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,960
Hi, Corie.

221
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,920
He left
about 20 minutes ago.

222
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,360
Looked very tired.

223
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,240
Tell him to call me
when he gets in.

224
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,480
I've got great news.

225
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,440
No kidding, Frank.
What is it?

226
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,760
Frank, hang on.
That may be him now.

227
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,640
I didn't
want him to come

228
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,560
till after
the furniture arrived.

229
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,360
Paul?

230
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,480
Corie?

231
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,920
Where are you?

232
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,040
Paul?

233
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,040
Up here!

234
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,440
Paul, up here, top floor!

235
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,200
Oh, it's him!

236
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,920
How long did you say
you were married?

237
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,040
Six days.

238
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,400
He won't notice
the place is empty till June.

239
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,840
So long,
Grammercy 59971.

240
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,760
Have a nice marriage.

241
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,880
Thank you.

242
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,400
And may you soon
have many extensions.

243
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,200
He's on his way up.

244
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,080
Can you hang on
for five more flights?

245
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,200
Paul?

246
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,080
Hurry up, darling!

247
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,800
Now, don't
expect too much,

248
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,200
'cause the furniture
hasn't gotten here yet!

249
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,160
And the paint didn't
turn out exactly right,

250
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,200
but I think it's
going to be beautiful!

251
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,160
Paul?

252
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,080
Paul, are you all right?

253
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,200
I'm coming.

254
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,920
I'm coming.

255
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,040
What?

256
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,480
He's coming.
He's coming.

257
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,840
He's coming.
He's coming.

258
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,680
Hi, sweetheart!

259
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,480
Paul, darling!

260
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,680
Oh! Say something.

261
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,520
It's six flights.
Did you...

262
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,880
Did you know
it's six flights?

263
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,800
Well, it isn't.
It's only five.

264
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,720
What about
that big thing

265
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,880
hanging outside
the building?

266
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,280
That's not a flight.
It's a stoop.

267
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,680
It may look
like a stoop.

268
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,600
It climbs
like a flight.

269
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,480
Is that all
you have to say?

270
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,360
I didn't think
I'd get that much out.

271
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,480
Oh.

272
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,880
But it didn't...

273
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,280
It didn't seem
like six flights

274
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,680
when I first
saw the apartment.

275
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,120
Why... why is that?

276
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,560
You didn't see
this apartment.

277
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,960
Don't you remember?
The woman wasn't home.

278
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,880
You saw the apartment
on the third floor.

279
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,960
That's why.

280
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,400
You don't like it.

281
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,840
I do like it, dear.

282
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,760
I'm just waiting
for my eyes to clear.

283
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,640
I thought
you'd say wow!

284
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,760
I will.

285
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,200
I will.
I'm just...

286
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,440
You...

287
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,600
Wow.

288
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,960
It's going
to be beautiful!

289
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,760
I promise you!

290
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,040
Do you know what?

291
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,160
What?

292
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,560
I missed you.

293
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,680
Really?

294
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,560
In the middle of the
Monday morning conference

295
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,680
I began to...

296
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,520
Let's go back
to the Plaza.

297
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,560
We have an hour
till checkout.

298
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,680
We can't.

299
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,800
Why?

300
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,720
We stole a towel
and three ashtrays. We're hot.

301
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,600
You know, for a lawyer,
you're some good kisser.

302
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,720
Heh-eh!

303
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,840
What?

304
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,240
For a kisser,
I'm some good lawyer.

305
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,360
Something's happened.

306
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,800
Something's happened.
Tell me!

307
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,240
It's not positive.

308
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,120
The office will call
and let me know.

309
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,960
They called.
I mean I called.

310
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,960
When?

311
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,000
Now.

312
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,120
Where?

313
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,560
Over there.
Right now.

314
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,000
You didn't tell me.

315
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,120
I forgot.

316
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,000
You kissed me
and got me all crazy.

317
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,320
Frank. Yes, Frank.
Tell me...

318
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,200
That's very funny,
Frank.

319
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,520
For a lawyer
I'm some good kisser.

320
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,960
I'd love to listen,

321
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,840
but I've got work to do.
You, too.

322
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,240
You've a got
a court case tomorrow.

323
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,680
Frank, are you kidding?

324
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,120
Do you mean this?

325
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,080
The whole thing?

326
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,520
Birnbaum v. Gump.

327
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,960
Marshall just
dumped the case

328
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,880
in our eager, inexperienced
little hands.

329
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,720
This is our chance for the key
to the executive washroom.

330
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,160
Well, we're a cinch.

331
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,560
I'll go over the briefs
here tonight.

332
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,400
I'll meet you at the office at 8:00
in the morning.

333
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,280
Frank, think I have time
to grow a mustache?

334
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,200
Did you hear?
Did you hear?

335
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,640
It's my first case!

336
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,880
I'm going to be
a lawyer!

337
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,320
That's great, Paul.

338
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,320
You going to have
to work tonight?

339
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,240
I'm going to go
over the affidavits.

340
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,640
This furrier's suing
a woman for nonpayment.

341
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,080
I've got the furrier.

342
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,000
I have a black
lace nightgown.

343
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,880
He made four coats
for a Park Avenue woman.

344
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,320
She doesn't want them.

345
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,160
She's 4 foot 8. He'd have to sell them
to a rich midget.

346
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,600
I'll put on a record

347
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,000
and do an original
Cambodian fertility dance.

348
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,440
There's no
signed contract.

349
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,880
What's happening?
What is this?

350
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,240
What are you doing?

351
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,120
I'm trying to get you
all hot and bothered,

352
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,520
and you're summing up
for the jury.

353
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,960
The whole marriage
is over.

354
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,400
Corie,
honey, I'm sorry.

355
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,840
I'm excited,
that's all.

356
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:23,200
You want me to be
rich and famous, don't you?

357
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,640
During the day.

358
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,520
At night I want you
here and sexy.

359
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,960
I will, I prom...

360
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,400
Tomorrow night...
your night.

361
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,320
We'll do whatever
you like, O.K.?

362
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,760
Something wild,
crazy, and insane?

363
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,880
Fine.

364
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,000
Like what?

365
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,440
I'll come home early.

366
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,880
We'll wallpaper
each other.

367
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,800
Tonight, dear,
I've got to work.

368
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,240
Please, O.K.? O.K.?

369
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,840
O.K.

370
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,280
So where
do I sit?

371
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,160
The furniture will be here
in a minute.

372
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,080
It probably got stuck
in traffic.

373
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,520
What about tonight?

374
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,440
I've got court
in the morning.

375
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,840
Maybe we ought
to check into a hotel.

376
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,240
We just checked out
of a hotel.

377
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,640
I want to sleep
in my own apartment.

378
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,080
Where, dear, where?

379
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,960
There's only room
for one in the bathtub.

380
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,160
Where's the bathtub?

381
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,080
There's no bathtub.
There's a shower.

382
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,480
How am I going
to take a bath?

383
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,920
You'll take a shower.

384
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,320
I don't like showers.
I like baths.

385
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,240
How will I
take a bath?

386
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,120
Lie down and hang your feet
over the sink.

387
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,560
Ha ha ha!

388
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,960
You know
it's freezing in here.

389
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,400
Isn't there any heat?

390
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,320
Of course.
There's a radiator.

391
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,040
The radiator's the coolest thing
in the room.

392
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,400
Does the building
have a janitor?

393
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,160
Only Monday, Wednesday,
and Friday.

394
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:51,040
Paul, it's going to warm up
a lot when the furniture gets here.

395
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,080
What about tonight?
I've got court in the morning.

396
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:57,360
Stop saying it like you have a case
every morning.

397
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,280
This is your first one.

398
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,240
Well, how...

399
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,840
What are you doing?

400
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,760
Seeing if these windows
are closed.

401
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,680
Why is it windy
in here?

402
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,600
I don't feel a draft.

403
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,040
I said wind.

404
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,440
There's a brisk northeasterly wind
blowing in here.

405
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,880
Don't get sarcastic.

406
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,280
I'm not getting sarcastic.
I'm getting chapped lips.

407
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,200
How can there be wind...

408
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,160
Aha!

409
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,600
How's this
for an answer?

410
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,320
There's a hole
in the skylight.

411
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,000
Paul,
don't get excited.

412
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,920
We'll plug it up
for tonight.

413
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,840
How?
That's 20 feet high.

414
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,720
Fly over in a plane
and drop something in.

415
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,320
It's only one night.
It's not that cold.

416
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,200
You know what it's like
in February at 3 A.M.?

417
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,440
It's ice-cold freezing.

418
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,360
It's not going
to be freezing.

419
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,160
It's going to be cloudy
with a light snow...

420
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,440
What? What? What?

421
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,640
Light what?

422
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,680
Snow.

423
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,080
Snow?

424
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,000
It's going to snow
tonight?

425
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:02,880
Hmm?

426
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,920
In here?

427
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,720
They're wrong as often
as they're right.

428
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,120
I'm going to be shoveling snow
in my living room.

429
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,520
First of all,
it's just a little hole.

430
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,760
Secondly,
what do you want me to do?

431
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,200
Go to pieces...

432
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,440
like me.

433
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,400
It's natural.

434
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,360
Paul...

435
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,800
I have a better idea.

436
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,800
I'm going to keep you warm.

437
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,200
And there's no charge
for electricity.

438
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,160
All right.

439
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,800
I can't do this.

440
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,200
Do you think
Corie would be upset

441
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,600
if I just popped up
and said hello?

442
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,520
Upset with
her own mother?

443
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,920
Why? I do it
all the time.

444
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,840
They're still practically
on their honeymoon.

445
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,960
She's probably dying
for your advice.

446
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,360
Not Corie.
She gives her own advice.

447
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,280
All right,
let's go home.

448
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,200
I'll just be 10 minutes.

449
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,920
No longer. I'll be circling
the block.

450
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:24,520
I see I haven't got
much of a law career ahead of me.

451
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,440
Good.
I hope we starve.

452
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,320
I hope they find us dead
in each other's arms.

453
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,200
"Frozen skinny lovers
found on 10th Street. "

454
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,760
Then we are in love again?

455
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,680
Yes,
we're in love again.

456
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,200
It's the bed.

457
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,480
It's the bed.

458
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,440
Yes.

459
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,200
I hope it's the bed.

460
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,960
Bloomingdale's?

461
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,440
Surprise!

462
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,400
Oh, no.

463
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,360
Your mother?

464
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,280
I invited her
for Tuesday.

465
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,800
I can't entertain her.
I've got court in the morning.

466
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,120
She's going to think
we're Gypsies

467
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,040
living in an empty store.

468
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,920
Five minutes ago,
this place was paradise.

469
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,360
Suddenly,
it's Cannery Row.

470
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,800
She doesn't
understand, Paul.

471
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,680
She has a different
set of values.

472
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,600
She's practical,
not young like us.

473
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,400
I'm 26
and cold as hell.

474
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,920
Sorry.

475
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,800
What?

476
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,240
Promise me one thing.

477
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,160
Don't tell her
about the rent.

478
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,560
If she asks you,
tell her you're not sure.

479
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,920
I have to know
what my rent is.

480
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,360
I'm a college graduate.

481
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,280
Can't you lie for me?

482
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,680
You don't have
to tell her it's 125.

483
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,600
How much is it,
then?

484
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,560
60.

485
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,520
65.

486
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,960
75, all right?

487
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,840
$75.63 a month, including gas
and electricity.

488
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,760
Paul, will she
believe that?

489
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,200
Anybody
would believe that.

490
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,080
It's the 125
that's hard to swallow.

491
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,520
Yes? Hello.

492
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,880
Yes, it is.

493
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,600
You what?

494
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,560
Thank you very much
for calling.

495
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,480
Furniture's not coming
till tomorrow.

496
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,400
They're sending up
a mattress

497
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,320
and some blankets
for tonight.

498
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,760
Won't that be cozy?

499
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,200
It'll be all right.

500
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,080
Don't let her stay here too long
because I've got...

501
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,440
A case in court in the morning.
I know.

502
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,400
Hello, Mother.

503
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,360
Hello, Mom.

504
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,800
I can't breathe.

505
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,240
Take it easy,
Mother.

506
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,160
I can't catch my breath.

507
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,600
You should
have rested.

508
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,000
I did, but there were always
more stairs.

509
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,440
Paul, help her.

510
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,880
Watch this step.

511
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,840
More stairs?

512
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,160
Mother, would you like
a glass of water?

513
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,040
No, thank you, dear.
I can't swallow yet.

514
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,960
Oh, my.

515
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,880
It's not that high,
Mother.

516
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,320
It's not bad, really.

517
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,240
What is it,
nine flights?

518
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:16,120
It's five. We don't count
the front stoop.

519
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,960
If I had known the people
on the third floor,

520
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,960
I'd have gone
to visit them.

521
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:26,080
Oh, gee, Mother,
what a pleasant surprise.

522
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,520
I'm not staying.

523
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,480
Aunt Harriet's honking the horn for me
in 10 minutes.

524
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,440
Just one good look
around.

525
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,840
I'm not sure
I'm coming back.

526
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,760
You can't
tell anything yet.

527
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:40,120
I wish you'd arrived
after the furniture had come.

528
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,960
I have a marvelous
imagination.

529
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,960
Hmm.

530
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,600
Well?

531
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:54,000
Corie, baby,
it's beautiful.

532
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,240
You hate it.

533
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:58,600
No, no, I love it.
It's a charming apartment.

534
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,440
I love it.

535
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,160
I knew you wouldn't
like it.

536
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,600
I love it.

537
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,520
Paul,
didn't I say that?

538
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,440
She said
she loved it.

539
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,360
I knew
I said it.

540
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:13,240
Are you absolutely
crazy in love with it?

541
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,680
Yes. It's very cute.

542
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,080
There's so much
you can do with it.

543
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,000
I told you
she'd hate it.

544
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,400
Corie, you don't give
a person a chance.

545
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,320
Let me see
the whole apartment.

546
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,760
This is it.

547
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,680
It's a nice large room.

548
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,120
There's a bedroom.

549
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,560
One flight up.

550
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,960
It's just two steps.
See, 1, 2... 3.

551
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,920
Oh, split level.

552
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,200
Where's the bedroom?
Through here?

553
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,600
No, in here.
This is the bedroom.

554
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,520
It's really
just a dressing room,

555
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,400
but I'm going to use it
as a bedroom.

556
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,800
You can just
put a bed in here.

557
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,760
That's right.

558
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,640
How?

559
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,040
It'll fit.
I measured the room.

560
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,480
A double bed?

561
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,920
No, a large single.

562
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,880
Very nice.

563
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,320
Where will
Paul sleep?

564
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,280
With me.

565
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,320
Large single?

566
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,200
But you won't be able
to get to the closet.

567
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,640
Yes, you will.

568
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,560
Without climbing
over the bed?

569
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,440
You have to climb
over the bed.

570
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,880
That's a good idea.

571
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,760
You can just hang your clothes
from the pipe.

572
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,760
That's right.

573
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,920
Everything
is just temporary.

574
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,800
What do they say
in Harper's Bazaar?

575
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,240
It won't take shape

576
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:23,120
until the bride's own
personality becomes clearly defined.

577
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,520
I think it's you
right now.

578
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,280
What's in here?

579
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,400
Oh... the bathroom.

580
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,240
No bathtub.

581
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,800
This is the kitchen.

582
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,480
It's very cozy.

583
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,920
It's chilly in here.

584
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,360
You feel a draft?

585
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,280
Stand over here.
It's warmer.

586
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,600
What you need
is a drink.

587
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:49,720
Would you run down
and get some Scotch?

588
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,640
You have
lots of wall space.

589
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,680
What color are you
going to paint it?

590
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,200
It's painted.

591
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,880
Very attractive.

592
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,320
I've got to go.

593
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,720
No, Mother. Not till you
have a drink.

594
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,120
Aren't you going
to get the Scotch?

595
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,040
I'll stay for
just one drink.

596
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,480
Button up. It's cold.

597
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,440
I've noticed.

598
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,880
Get some cheese.

599
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:12,840
Paul!

600
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,720
I just want to give
my fella a kiss

601
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,160
and wish him luck.

602
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,080
Your new home
is beautiful.

603
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,000
It's a perfect
little apartment.

604
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,920
And you do like it?

605
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,800
Where else can you get
anything like this

606
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,240
for 75.63 a month?

607
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,680
Are you sure,
Paul?

608
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,920
Six flights
of stairs again.

609
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,400
It's the only way
to travel.

610
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,360
Well...

611
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,080
Corie, baby,
I'm so excited for you.

612
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,280
Mother,
it's not exactly

613
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,200
what you pictured,
is it?

614
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,240
Well, it's unusual...

615
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,240
like you.

616
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:52,120
I remember when you were
a little girl.

617
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:55,000
You said you wanted
to live on the moon.

618
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,760
I thought
you were joking.

619
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,600
Well, drunk again, huh?

620
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,560
O.K., I'll take care
of him.

621
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,880
I know what let's do.

622
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,760
Let's open my presents
and see what you sent me.

623
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:28,240
Hey, what's in here?
That sounds expensive.

624
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,840
Now I think
it's a broken clock.

625
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,800
Aunt Harriet
helped me pick it out.

626
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,640
She thinks I should move
into New York City now.

627
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,080
That's an idea.

628
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,480
"Why, Harriet? Just because
I'm alone?" I said.

629
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,400
"I'm not afraid
to live alone.

630
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,280
In some ways, it's better
to live alone,"

631
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,240
I said.

632
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,120
Does this pot
come with directions?

633
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,520
If I had known
about this kitchen,

634
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,920
it would have come
with hot coffee.

635
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,640
Mother,
I love everything.

636
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:12,520
You've got to stop
sending me presents.

637
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,400
You should start
spending your money on yourself.

638
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,520
Myself?

639
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:20,360
What does a woman like me need
living all alone

640
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,280
way out
in New Jersey?

641
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,720
You could travel.

642
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,760
Travel.

643
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:28,400
Alone? At my age?

644
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:31,280
I read a story
in the Times.

645
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,360
Middle-aged woman
traveling alone

646
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,240
fell off the deck
of a ship.

647
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:39,360
They never discovered it
till they got to France.

648
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,680
Mother...

649
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,560
If you ever fell off
the deck of a ship,

650
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,480
somebody would know
about it.

651
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,000
Know what I think
you really need?

652
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,960
I don't want to hear it.

653
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,880
You're afraid
to hear the truth.

654
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,480
It's not the truth
I'm afraid to hear.

655
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,880
It's the word
you're going to use.

656
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,760
Love. Last week I didn't know
what it meant.

657
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,160
Then I checked in
to the Plaza Hotel.

658
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,680
Know what happened there?

659
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,560
I promised myself
I wouldn't ask.

660
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,000
I fell in love.

661
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,920
Spiritual, physical,
and emotional love.

662
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,080
No one should be
without it.

663
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,520
I have you.

664
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,440
I'm not talking
about that kind...

665
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,360
I know what you're
talking about.

666
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,280
You don't want
to discuss it?

667
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,840
Not with you
present.

668
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,520
That must be
Aunt Harriet.

669
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,960
I've got to go.

670
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,160
Some visit.

671
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,600
Just a sneak preview.

672
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,000
I'll see you Tuesday
for the world premiere.

673
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,800
You shouldn't have run
just for me.

674
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,760
Goodbye, love.

675
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,680
I love
your new apartment.

676
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,760
I'll see you both
on Tuesday.

677
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,840
Geronimo.

678
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,440
Paul, what's the matter?

679
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,920
I just had
an interesting talk

680
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,320
with the man
in the liquor store.

681
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,200
We have some of the greatest weirdos
in the country

682
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,640
living
in this building.

683
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,600
Like who?

684
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,520
In Apartment 1C
are the Boscos,

685
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,960
Mr. And Mrs.
J. Bosco.

686
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,400
Who are they?

687
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,800
A lovely young couple
of the same sex.

688
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,200
No one knows
which one that is.

689
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,600
In 3C are
Mr. And Mrs. Gonzales...

690
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,000
Mr. And Mrs. Armandariz,
and Mr. Calhoun,

691
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,920
who must be
the umpire.

692
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,840
Guess who lives in 4D.

693
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,280
I don't know.

694
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,640
Nobody else does either.

695
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,560
Nobody's been seen
in three years,

696
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,320
except every morning
there are nine empty tuna cans

697
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,760
outside the door.

698
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,640
Sounds like a big cat
with a can opener.

699
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,040
Victor Velasco
lives in 6A, the attic.

700
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,440
He's 58. He skis,
he climbs mountains,

701
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,360
he's been married
four times.

702
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,640
He's known as the Bluebeard
of 10th Street.

703
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,880
What does that mean?

704
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,720
Either he attacks girls
or he's got a blue beard.

705
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,920
Where are you going?

706
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,320
To stand in the bedroom
and work.

707
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,680
If the bed or the heat
comes up, let me know.

708
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,640
Paul...

709
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,600
Hmm?

710
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,960
Are you asleep?

711
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:35,240
Just my hands
and my feet.

712
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,160
Know what the trouble is?

713
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,080
We're wearing
too much clothing.

714
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,480
Know how the Eskimos
keep warm?

715
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,400
They check into a motel.

716
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,840
Paul, do you hate me?

717
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,800
Yes.

718
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,760
Say it.

719
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,720
I hate you.

720
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,120
I hate you.

721
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,080
There's somebody
at the door.

722
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,480
If it's the Red Cross,
let them in.

723
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,400
Aren't you
going to answer it?

724
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,800
You found the apartment.
You answer it.

725
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,480
Paul.

726
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,800
Who are you?

727
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,920
Who are you?

728
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,880
I live here.

729
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,880
So do I.

730
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,440
How delightful.

731
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,840
I hope I didn't
disturb you.

732
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,200
My name is Velasco,
Victor Velasco.

733
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,480
The Bluebeard...
from the attic?

734
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,520
I was wondering
if I could use your bedroom.

735
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,960
The bedroom? No.

736
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,880
I can't get
into my apartment.

737
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,760
I wanted to crawl out your window
along the ledge.

738
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,680
Did you
lose your key?

739
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:04,040
I have my key, but it no longer
fits the lock.

740
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,880
The penalty of being
four months behind on the rent.

741
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,200
So, you say
you live here?

742
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,320
Just moved in today.

743
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,680
Really? And what are you,
a folk singer?

744
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,040
No, a wife.

745
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,920
You know, of course,
you're very pretty.

746
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,480
All indications point
to my falling in love with you.

747
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:32,840
I see our ratfink landlord has left
a hole in the skylight.

748
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,720
He's going to fix it,
won't he?

749
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,640
I wouldn't
count on it.

750
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:40,520
My bathtub has been leaking
since 1949.

751
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,880
Tell me... does your husband, uh,
work during the day?

752
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,840
Yes.

753
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,280
In an office?

754
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,240
Yes.

755
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:50,120
Good. I work at home
during the day.

756
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,560
I predict interesting
complications.

757
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,480
Am I making you
nervous?

758
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,440
Very nervous.

759
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,400
Ha! Wonderful.

760
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,840
Once a month

761
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:59,720
I try to make
pretty young girls nervous

762
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,600
just to keep my ego
from going out.

763
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:05,480
I'll save you
a lot of anguish.

764
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,880
I'm 6...
I'm 58 years old

765
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,640
and a thoroughly
nice fellow.

766
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,720
Well, I'm glad
to hear that.

767
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,400
I wish I were
10 years older.

768
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,880
Older?

769
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:20,200
Dirty old men seem to get away
with a lot more.

770
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,120
I'm still
at the awkward age.

771
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,360
When do I get
invited down for dinner?

772
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,760
Dinner? We'd love to have you
for dinner

773
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,680
as soon as we
get set up.

774
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,120
With newlyweds,
I could starve to death.

775
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,120
Shall we say
next Tuesday night?

776
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,520
Tuesday night?
No, my mother's...

777
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,960
Tuesday night's
fine.

778
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,640
It's a date.

779
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,080
I'll bring the wine.

780
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,480
You can pay me
when I get here.

781
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,360
You're invited to my cocktail party
tomorrow night, 10:00.

782
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,680
You do drink, don't you?

783
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,720
Yes, of course.

784
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,760
Good. Bring liquor.
Until tomorrow.

785
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,680
If we don't
freeze first.

786
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,560
You don't know
about the plumbing, do you?

787
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,960
Everything in this museum
works backwards.

788
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:01,320
For example, on the steam,
it says turn right,

789
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,760
so you turn left.

790
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,680
Except I can't reach it.

791
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,080
Will you help me up,
please?

792
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,480
With the greatest
of physical pleasure.

793
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,160
1, 2, 3, up.

794
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,280
Corie, was there anyone...

795
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,360
We were just warming up
the apartment.

796
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,920
Uh, Paul...

797
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:25,880
Whoo!

798
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,280
This is Mr. Velasco
from upstairs.

799
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,200
He was just telling me

800
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,120
that all our plumbing
works backwards.

801
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,320
That's right.

802
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,240
An important thing
to remember is

803
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:38,120
you have to flush up.
Until tomorrow night.

804
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,040
What's tomorrow night?
Where's he going?

805
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,480
Don't forget Tuesday.

806
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:44,120
What's he doing
in the bedroom?

807
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:07,480
That nut went out
the window.

808
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,560
Hello.

809
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,000
Hello, Mother?
It's me.

810
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,400
Did you hear
what I said?

811
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,560
Nothing's wrong.

812
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:23,240
I just want to confirm
our Tuesday night dinner date.

813
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,200
At 2:00
in the morning?

814
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,920
I want to be sure
you'll come.

815
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,720
At 2:00
in the morning?

816
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:31,600
And, Mother, wear something
gay and frivolous.

817
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:34,080
Buy a new dress.

818
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,200
At 2:00
in the morning?

819
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,680
I'll call you
tomorrow. Bye.

820
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,360
Who you waving at?

821
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,200
Him.

822
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,560
I decided to meet you here
every day.

823
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,440
It takes you so long
to climb the stairs,

824
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,360
and I can't wait for you.

825
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,760
The bus driver will think
you're my mother.

826
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,600
Have you
an Aunt Fern?

827
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:37,000
She sent us
a check today.

828
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:39,880
Boy, do you have
a cheap Aunt Fern.

829
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,800
I'll write
and tell her.

830
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,720
Your mother called
from Philly.

831
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,600
She and your father
are coming up,

832
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:49,960
and your sister has
a new boyfriend from Rutgers.

833
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:52,840
He has acne, and
they all hate him,

834
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,280
including
your sister.

835
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,200
Did you miss me
today?

836
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,160
No.

837
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:58,120
Why not?

838
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,560
You called eight times.

839
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:02,440
I don't talk to you
that much when I'm home.

840
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:05,320
Grouch. How'd it go
in court today?

841
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,760
Gump or Birnbaum?

842
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:07,720
Birnbaum.

843
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,160
You won? Oh, Paul!

844
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,640
Oh, I'm so proud.

845
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,440
Aren't you happy?

846
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,360
We were awarded
6 cents.

847
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,760
You have to be
awarded something,

848
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:20,640
so the court made it
6 cents.

849
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,560
How much do you get?

850
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,480
Birnbaum gets
the whole 6 cents.

851
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,920
From here on in,

852
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,760
I get the cases that come in
for a dime or under.

853
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,720
Grouch,
grouch, grouch.

854
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,600
You weren't that grouchy
under the covers.

855
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:41,920
Do you have to carry on a personal
conversation with me on the stairs?

856
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,360
What's wrong with it?

857
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,760
Everybody knows
the intimate details of your life.

858
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:48,640
I ring the bell, and suddenly
we're on the air.

859
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,040
I better make you
a drink.

860
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:53,440
You're supposed to be
charming tonight.

861
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,320
This little dinner
you have planned for tonight

862
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,200
has got fiasco
written all over it.

863
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,080
Maybe they have
a lot in common.

864
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,520
Are you kidding?

865
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,640
Your mother?

866
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,520
That quiet, dainty
little woman from New Jersey

867
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,920
and the Count
of Monte Cristo?

868
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:10,880
You must be kidding.

869
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:11,800
Why?

870
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:13,240
You've seen
his apartment.

871
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,640
He wears Japanese kimonos
and sleeps on rugs.

872
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,480
Your mother wears a hair net
and sleeps on a board.

873
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,000
Boof.

874
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,920
Maybe we could help her.

875
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,840
We don't have
to introduce her

876
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:35,240
as my dull, 52-year-old,
housewife mother.

877
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:37,640
That wasn't the exact wording
I had planned.

878
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:39,560
What did you have
in mind?

879
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:41,000
Something more glamorous.

880
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,240
Former actress.

881
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,600
You know, of course,
that she was in

882
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,520
The Man
Who Came To Dinner.

883
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,920
Your mother? Where?
The East Orange Women's Club?

884
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,320
On Broadway. She was in
the original company

885
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,840
of Strange Interlude,

886
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,240
and she had
a small singing part

887
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,680
in Knickerbocker Holiday.

888
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,120
Are you serious?

889
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,560
Cross my heart.

890
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:05,000
Your mother an actress?

891
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:06,000
Yeah.

892
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,320
You never told me this.

893
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,720
Why didn't you
ever tell me?

894
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:14,120
I didn't think
you'd be interested.

895
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,560
That's fascinating.

896
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,800
I can't get over that.

897
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,000
See?
Now you're interested.

898
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,440
It's a lie.

899
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:23,880
Every bit of it.

900
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,840
I'm going to control
myself.

901
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:49,960
Hello, Mom.

902
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,240
Are you
all right?

903
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:52,200
Paul...

904
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:53,160
Yes, Mom.

905
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:55,560
In my handbag...
are some pink pills.

906
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:56,840
Pink pills? Right.

907
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:59,720
I'll be all right.
I'm a little out of breath.

908
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,640
I'll get you
something to drink.

909
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:04,040
I had to park
three blocks away.

910
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:06,840
It started to rain, so I ran
the last two blocks.

911
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,400
Then my heel got caught in
the subway grating.

912
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:12,280
When I pulled my foot out,
I stepped in a puddle.

913
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,840
Then a cab went by and
splashed my stockings.

914
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:17,240
If the hardware
store downstairs was open,

915
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:20,120
I was going to buy a knife
and kill myself.

916
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,080
Drink this.

917
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:22,520
Here's your pill,
Mom.

918
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,080
A martini
to wash down a pill.

919
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:30,680
It'll make you
feel better.

920
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:33,240
A martini I had at
home made me sick.

921
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:34,840
That's what
the pill's for.

922
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,440
Let me help you
inside.

923
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,000
You need food. I'll get you
an hors d'oeuvre.

924
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:39,960
No, thanks.

925
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:42,360
It's just sour cream
and blue cheese.

926
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:44,280
I wish you hadn't
said that.

927
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:45,560
Like to lie down?

928
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:48,600
No, thanks, dear.
I can't lie down without my board.

929
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:52,440
Right now, all I want to do is
see the apartment.

930
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,360
Well, then...
help you up.

931
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:55,480
Up.

932
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:01,800
Corie.

933
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:03,840
Corie!

934
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,120
Do you like it?

935
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,360
Like it?

936
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:07,320
Tsk.

937
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:11,280
It's magnificent.

938
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:13,840
Oh...

939
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:17,960
Oh. And you did it all
by yourself.

940
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,880
Mr. Velasco gave me
some ideas.

941
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:21,160
- Who?
- Our decorator.

942
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,800
He comes in through the window
once a week.

943
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,920
Oh, the man
that lives upstairs.

944
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,320
Oh, you've heard
about him, eh?

945
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,200
Yes. Corie had me on the phone for
two hours yesterday.

946
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,600
Did you know he's been married
four times?

947
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:36,480
Yes. If I were you,
I'd sleep with a gun.

948
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:39,320
Mother...

949
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,720
See, we did
get the bed in.

950
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,320
Yes. Just fits,
doesn't it?

951
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,720
Just. We have to
turn in unison.

952
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,160
Well, I must admit,

953
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:49,960
I never expected
anything like this.

954
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,680
Can't wait to see
the expression

955
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:54,600
on your parents'
faces tonight, Paul.

956
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:56,520
I beg your...
my what?

957
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:57,800
Your mother
and father.

958
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:59,400
We're dining
with them tonight.

959
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:01,240
Isn't that what
you said, Corie?

960
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:03,160
Is that what
you told her?

961
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:06,040
If I said you had a blind date
with Mr. Velasco,

962
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:08,600
I couldn't have blasted you
out of the house.

963
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:10,200
Blind date
with Mr. Velas...

964
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,800
The man that
lives upst...

965
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:12,760
Good God.

966
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:14,360
What's all the panic,
Mother?

967
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:15,800
He's just a man.

968
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,720
My accountant
is just a man.

969
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:20,120
You make him sound like
Douglas Fairbanks.

970
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:23,000
He looks nothing
like Douglas Fairbanks, does he, Paul?

971
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,880
No. He just
jumps like him.

972
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,440
Come on. You're going to have
a marvelous evening.

973
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:28,720
Come on where?

974
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:30,320
To Mr. Velasco's
for cocktails.

975
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:31,600
I'm not even dressed.

976
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:32,880
You look fine.

977
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,440
For Paul's parents
I just wanted to look clean.

978
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,040
He'll think
I'm a nurse.

979
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:38,640
He'll think you're very
interesting.

980
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:39,920
How's my hair?

981
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:42,320
Fine. Push it up
a bit in back.

982
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:44,720
Paul, is something
wrong with my hair?

983
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,720
Mother, just try to go along
with everything.

984
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:51,120
What do you mean?
Where are we going?

985
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:52,720
Be one
of the fellows.

986
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,000
One of what fellows?

987
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:55,280
Should I go first?

988
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:56,240
Go where?

989
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:58,640
Up there. That's where
the birdman lives.

990
00:49:58,680 --> 00:49:59,640
Good Lord.

991
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:01,600
Oh...

992
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:04,000
Go on, Paul.
It's all right, Mother.

993
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,720
I'll be right
behind you.

994
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:06,680
Oh!

995
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,360
Mother, are you
all right?

996
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,760
Oh, my! You should've
told me about this.

997
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:12,360
I'd have gone
into training.

998
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:14,480
I've got you.
Paul, pull her up.

999
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:15,760
Give me your hand.

1000
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,040
You're pulling
my arm!

1001
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:18,320
Stop pulling
her arm!

1002
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:19,920
I'm not pulling.
I'm helping.

1003
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:20,880
Ohh!

1004
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:23,280
Thank you.

1005
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:26,120
Oh! Isn't this wild?
What do you think, Mother?

1006
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:27,560
I've broken
some straps.

1007
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:28,520
Hello?

1008
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,520
Ah, my guests.

1009
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:32,480
Paul...

1010
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,040
I beg
your pardon?

1011
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,440
I was just saying
hello in Burmese.

1012
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:38,400
Corie,
ra-vi-shing!

1013
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:39,680
What does that mean?

1014
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,440
Ravishing.
That's English.

1015
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:42,880
Ha ha ha ha!

1016
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,800
Paul, would you do
the honors?

1017
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,360
I don't believe you've met Corie's
mother... Mrs. Banks.

1018
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,160
Mom, our new neighbor...
Mr. Velasco.

1019
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:50,440
How do you do?

1020
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:53,280
Mrs. Banks, I've been
looking forward so to meeting you.

1021
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,760
I invited your daughter
to my cocktail party,

1022
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:58,800
and she spent the entire evening
talking of you.

1023
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,760
That must've been
a dull party.

1024
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,040
Not at all.

1025
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:05,240
I meant talking about me
must've been dull, not the party.

1026
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,680
Ha ha. I understand.

1027
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:07,640
Thank you.

1028
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,080
Won't you sit down?

1029
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:21,720
Whishhh!

1030
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,160
Aren't these
marvelous?

1031
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,280
Yes, they're
marvelous.

1032
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:27,200
And now...

1033
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:30,080
Knichi!

1034
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,040
Knichi?

1035
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:32,640
It's an
hors d'oeuvre, Mother.

1036
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,240
Mr. Velasco
makes them himself.

1037
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:36,000
He's a... a
famous gourmet.

1038
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:37,120
Gourmet.
Imagine.

1039
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,680
Didn't you once cook for the
king of Sweden?

1040
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:42,080
Well, we belong to the same
gourmet society.

1041
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:43,520
150 charter
members,

1042
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,520
including the king,
Prince Philip,

1043
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:46,520
Fidel Castro.

1044
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:47,800
Fidel Castro,
too.

1045
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:50,200
Yes. We meet once
every five years

1046
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,720
for a dinner
we cook ourselves.

1047
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,720
In 1987, they're
supposed to come to my house.

1048
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:57,840
We have another
30 seconds.

1049
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:58,800
Till what?

1050
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:00,240
Until they're
edible.

1051
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:01,680
The last 15 seconds,

1052
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:04,080
we just let them
sit there and breathe.

1053
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:06,120
Oh, Paul,
aren't they gorgeous?

1054
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:07,320
Yeah.

1055
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:08,760
When you eat knichi,

1056
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,160
you take a bite
into history.

1057
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,560
Knichi is over
2,000 years old.

1058
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:16,440
Not this particular batch,
of course. Ha ha.

1059
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,200
Ha ha ha ha...

1060
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:19,640
Ha ha ha.

1061
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:23,120
Would you be betraying the society
by telling us what's in them?

1062
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:24,840
Well, if caught,

1063
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:27,240
your taste buds
are ostracized for two years.

1064
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:28,840
But since I'm
among friends...

1065
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,760
It's bits
of salted fish,

1066
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:31,720
grated olives,

1067
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:32,840
spices,

1068
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:34,280
and onion batter.

1069
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:36,400
Ready?

1070
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:38,600
5...

1071
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:39,720
4...

1072
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:40,680
3...

1073
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:41,640
2...

1074
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:43,560
1... 0. Mrs. Banks.

1075
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:45,040
Oh. Thank you.

1076
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,320
What's the fish?

1077
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:48,280
Eel.

1078
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:49,600
Eel?

1079
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:50,680
Eel.

1080
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:53,040
That's why the time element
is so essential.

1081
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:54,480
Eel spoils quickly.

1082
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:56,400
Mrs. Banks,
you're not eating.

1083
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:59,280
I had a martini
and a pink pill, and I think...

1084
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:00,560
Oh, please, please.

1085
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,840
The temperature of the knichi
is very important.

1086
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:04,400
You must eat it now.

1087
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,760
In five minutes,
we throw it away.

1088
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:09,000
Wouldn't want you
to do that.

1089
00:53:09,035 --> 00:53:10,500
Uh, no, no.
Pop it.

1090
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:11,780
I beg
your pardon?

1091
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:13,700
If you nibble,
knichi tastes bitter.

1092
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:15,300
You must, uh, pop it.

1093
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:16,300
Look.

1094
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:19,380
See?

1095
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:20,340
Oh, yes.

1096
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:23,780
Ha ha ha ha.

1097
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:24,740
Here.

1098
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:26,020
Oh. Thank you.

1099
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:33,420
Are you O.K.?

1100
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:35,980
I think I popped it
back too far.

1101
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:42,020
Was that water?

1102
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:44,420
No. Vodka. I use it
in the knichi.

1103
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:45,660
Oh, my stomach.

1104
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:48,060
Of course, the trick
is to pop it

1105
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:50,380
right through the center
of the tongue.

1106
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:53,540
Then it gets the benefit
of the entire palate. Corie.

1107
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:55,500
Well... here goes.

1108
00:53:57,140 --> 00:53:58,540
How about that?

1109
00:53:58,580 --> 00:54:01,900
Perfect! You are the prettiest epicurean
I've ever seen.

1110
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:02,860
Paul.

1111
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:06,020
No. No, thank you.
L... I have a bad arm.

1112
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:08,580
You can try. Paul,
you have to try everything.

1113
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:10,060
Right, Mr. Velasco?

1114
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:12,500
Well, as the French say,
at least once.

1115
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:21,980
Ah.

1116
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:23,940
Bitter.

1117
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:24,900
Right?

1118
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:26,500
You know why,
don't you?

1119
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:28,100
I nibbled,
I didn't pop.

1120
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:30,020
Yeah. Have another.
Try to pop...

1121
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:32,420
I don't care
to pop another one. Besides,

1122
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:34,500
we're over
the five-minute limit.

1123
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:36,900
Are we ready to go out
to dinner?

1124
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:39,460
I thought we were having dinner
at your flat.

1125
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:41,220
No. Our stove
caught fire.

1126
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:42,540
Goodness.
What happened?

1127
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:44,420
Nothing. We just
turned it on.

1128
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:46,340
If you're looking
for the unusual,

1129
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:47,700
I have
a suggestion.

1130
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:49,140
That's what
we want...

1131
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:50,420
The unusual,
right, Mother?

1132
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:52,820
Oh, you know me...
one of the fellows.

1133
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:55,220
Then we're off
to The Four Winds.

1134
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:56,820
The Chinese restaurant,
53rd Street?

1135
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:59,220
No, the Albanian restaurant
on Staten Island.

1136
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:00,500
We'll take
the ferry.

1137
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:01,780
Ferry...
in February.

1138
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:04,180
I love it already!
Come on, Mother.

1139
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:05,620
Paul, help her.

1140
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:09,700
It won't let go
of me. Ha ha! Oh...

1141
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:15,940
Now, don't expect anything
lavish in the way of decor.

1142
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:17,540
Actually,
I'm not even sure

1143
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:19,460
that they have
a restaurant license.

1144
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:22,340
Mr. Velasco,
don't you wear a coat?

1145
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:24,260
Well, it's
only 30 degrees.

1146
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:25,700
For me,
it's springtime.

1147
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:28,100
Ready? My group,
stay close to me.

1148
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:29,380
If anyone gets lost,

1149
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:31,780
we'll meet
at the United States Embassy.

1150
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:35,940
Where were you?

1151
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:37,220
Getting my gloves.

1152
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:40,100
What do you need gloves for?
It's only 30 degrees.

1153
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:41,540
Oh. Sorry, I forgot.

1154
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:43,420
We're having
a heat wave.

1155
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:52,580
Do you have a dime?

1156
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:53,660
Yeah.

1157
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:04,420
Would you look
at her?

1158
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:05,860
Look at her.

1159
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:11,380
She's freezing to death,
but she wouldn't admit that.

1160
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:13,740
I'll admit it.
I'm freezing to death.

1161
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:18,740
Ah! Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!

1162
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:22,100
Ha ha ha! Hi!

1163
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:23,060
Hello!

1164
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:24,500
Ha ha ha!

1165
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:38,620
Voila!

1166
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:41,780
Come on, Mother.

1167
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:50,420
Uh, listen, are you sure we're
in the right place?

1168
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:52,500
Well... inhale.

1169
00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:53,660
This way.

1170
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:54,860
Heavenly!

1171
00:56:56,740 --> 00:56:59,740
Em Shash Kepop...
The Four Winds.

1172
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:01,660
I bid you now enter

1173
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:03,780
a gastronomical
paradise.

1174
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:06,860
Kishama!

1175
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:08,300
Velasco!
Ha ha!

1176
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:09,260
Ha ha!

1177
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:10,540
Ha ha!

1178
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:12,780
Mmm!

1179
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:14,220
You taste
delicious!

1180
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:16,780
You think so?
I put myself on the menu.

1181
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:18,380
How many people
you got?

1182
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:20,780
Four. All cold, all tired,
and all starving.

1183
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:23,180
Good. First you drink,
then you eat,

1184
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:25,100
then you go
up to my bed

1185
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:27,020
and take
a little sleep, huh?

1186
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:30,220
Get up! Huh!

1187
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:43,780
Aha! Ouzo!

1188
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:46,180
My beautiful,
beloved ouzo.

1189
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:47,460
Paul,
do you drink?

1190
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:50,180
Yes, thank you. Ouzo, I'd like
a Scotch, please.

1191
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:52,100
No, no. Uh,
this is ouzo.

1192
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:53,540
She is Mushka.

1193
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:56,260
Paul, didn't you
know this was ouzo?

1194
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:57,380
No.

1195
00:57:57,420 --> 00:57:58,820
Is the glass
dirty?

1196
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:00,260
What color
is ouzo?

1197
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:01,220
White.

1198
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:02,220
It's dirty.

1199
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:11,020
To the beginning
of new friendships.

1200
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:13,900
Viznetz korvorsh
keyem buzu!

1201
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:15,340
What does
that mean?

1202
00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:17,860
I don't know.
I just made it up. Cheers!

1203
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:19,060
Cheers!

1204
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:21,500
Oh!

1205
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:22,540
Whoo!

1206
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:23,620
Wow!

1207
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:25,060
Ha ha ha!
Whoo!

1208
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:26,660
Here's to your
health, Mom.

1209
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:28,380
Thank you.
To my health.

1210
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:32,060
Have another one,
quickly.

1211
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:33,340
No, thank you,
really.

1212
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:35,260
Please. One
can make you sick.

1213
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:37,580
Two starts you
on the road to recovery.

1214
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:41,340
Pelmenchki!

1215
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:42,620
I don't
believe it!

1216
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:44,940
Taste it.
You still won't believe it.

1217
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:46,380
Pelmenchki!
For us!

1218
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:48,780
He only makes it
twice a year.

1219
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:52,540
If you like it,
I make you more next July.

1220
00:58:52,620 --> 00:58:53,500
Ha ha.

1221
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:55,140
To pelmenchki.

1222
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:59,740
Pour it in right away.
Otherwise, it goes sour.

1223
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:19,980
Hey, it's Mushka.

Hey, I like that.
What are they playing?

1231
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:41,420
It's an old
Albanian folk song.

1232
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:43,020
What does
shama shama mean?

1233
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:45,420
Uh, Jimmy crack corn,
and I don't care.

1234
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:46,380
No kidding.

I'll race you
up the stairs!

1261
01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:15,700
No! No! No!

1262
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:16,660
Oh, you!

1263
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:17,620
Oh!

1264
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:19,060
Ha ha ha ha!

1265
01:01:19,140 --> 01:01:20,020
Oh!

1266
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:20,980
Ha ha!

1267
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:22,420
No, you don't!

1268
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:23,380
No! No!

1269
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:24,660
Aah! Aah!

1270
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:25,620
Ha ha!

1271
01:01:26,660 --> 01:01:27,540
Whoo!

1272
01:01:29,380 --> 01:01:30,820
Ohhh, no.

1273
01:01:33,060 --> 01:01:34,620
I won!

1274
01:01:36,340 --> 01:01:38,980
I won. Ha ha
ha ha ha!

1275
01:01:39,060 --> 01:01:41,540
That was not a fair race.
You tickled me.

1276
01:01:42,580 --> 01:01:44,940
Hey, how do you
say it again?

1277
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:45,940
Say what?

1278
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:48,340
Waiter, there's
a fly in my soup.

1279
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:50,260
Oh. Poopla,
sirca al mercoori.

1280
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:51,700
Sirca, poopla
al mercoori.

1281
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:52,620
No, no.

1282
01:01:52,660 --> 01:01:53,700
No?

1283
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:56,260
That's, "fly,
you have a waiter in my soup. "

1284
01:01:56,340 --> 01:01:59,660
I did. He put his hand in
to take out the fly.

1285
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:01,100
Ha ha ha!

1286
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:03,500
Ooh! How's my head
going to feel tomorrow?

1287
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:04,460
Wonderful!

1288
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:05,420
No headache?

1289
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:07,340
No, but
you won't be able

1290
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:10,220
to make a fist
for three days.

1291
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:11,180
Hey!

1292
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:12,980
Look at that!

1293
01:02:13,060 --> 01:02:15,180
Coffee. We promised
to make coffee.

1294
01:02:15,260 --> 01:02:18,060
Oh! And a promise
is a promise!

1295
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:34,220
I forgot the stove
doesn't work.

1296
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:35,780
Hey, upstairs,
everybody, for coffee.

1297
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:37,380
Don't you two
want coffee?

1298
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:39,820
Oh, they'll drink it
if we make it.

1299
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:42,700
Don't you two go away.
Shama shama el mal kema ma.

1300
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:53,020
I feel like
we've died...

1301
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:55,900
and gone to heaven...

1302
01:02:57,420 --> 01:02:59,260
only we had
to climb up.

1303
01:03:02,060 --> 01:03:04,860
Struck down
in the prime of life.

1304
01:03:04,940 --> 01:03:07,740
It isn't exactly
that I feel sick, just...

1305
01:03:07,820 --> 01:03:09,340
kind of numb...

1306
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:13,180
and I can't
make a fist.

1307
01:03:16,060 --> 01:03:18,620
Mom, you want to hear
something frightening?

1308
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:22,900
My teeth feel soft.

1309
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:25,820
Huh. It's funny.

1310
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:28,700
The best thing we had all night
was the knichi.

1311
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:32,540
Ohh... anyway, Corie
had a good time.

1312
01:03:32,620 --> 01:03:35,940
She seems to get
such a terrific kick out of living.

1313
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:38,460
You've got to admire that,
don't you, Paul?

1314
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:40,380
Yes, yes.
I admire anybody

1315
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:42,780
who has three portions
of pelenchki.

1316
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:44,220
I tried, Paul.

1317
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:46,780
I just couldn't seem
to work up an appetite

1318
01:03:46,860 --> 01:03:47,980
the way they did.

1319
01:03:48,060 --> 01:03:49,900
No, you mustn't blame
yourself, Mom.

1320
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:52,780
We're not used
to that kind of food, that's all.

1321
01:03:52,860 --> 01:03:54,700
You don't...
pick up a fork

1322
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:56,620
and dig
into a black salad.

1323
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:58,620
You got to play
with it.

1324
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:01,140
I don't think I could get through
coffee tonight.

1325
01:04:01,220 --> 01:04:03,060
I'm all out
of pink pills.

1326
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:04,340
Where you going?

1327
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:06,900
Home. I'd like to die
in my own bed.

1328
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:08,500
What will I
tell them?

1329
01:04:08,580 --> 01:04:10,420
Make up some
clever little lie.

1330
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:13,300
Tell Corie I'm not
really her mother.

1331
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:16,500
We've decided to have
flaming brandy.

1332
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:18,900
I'm afraid you must
excuse me, darling,

1333
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:20,820
but it is
a little late.

1334
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:22,420
You can't go.
It's early.

1335
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:25,300
I know, but I have a 10:00
dentist appointment at 9:00,

1336
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:27,700
and it's been
a very long evening,

1337
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:30,100
and I don't know
what I'm saying.

1338
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:31,380
You can't do that.

1339
01:04:31,460 --> 01:04:32,660
Darling.
Good night, Paul.

1340
01:04:32,740 --> 01:04:33,940
Good night,
Mr. Velasco.

1341
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:35,220
Good night,
Paul.

1342
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:36,180
Good night.

1343
01:04:36,260 --> 01:04:37,460
Good night,
Corie.

1344
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:38,740
You're not
going, too?

1345
01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:41,100
Certainly. I'm driving
Mrs. Banks home.

1346
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:43,020
Oh, no. I mean,
it's too late.

1347
01:04:43,060 --> 01:04:44,100
For what?

1348
01:04:44,140 --> 01:04:47,180
The buses stop at 2:00.
How would you get home?

1349
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:50,260
Why worry about that?
I'll meet that problem in New Jersey.

1350
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:52,300
Really, Mr. Velasco,
it's very sweet...

1351
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:53,260
Victor.

1352
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:54,500
What?

1353
01:04:54,580 --> 01:04:57,060
If we're spending
the rest of the evening together,

1354
01:04:57,140 --> 01:04:59,980
it must be Victor. And I insist
the arrangement be reciprocal.

1355
01:05:00,020 --> 01:05:01,420
What is it?

1356
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:03,260
What
is what?

1357
01:05:03,340 --> 01:05:04,420
Your name,
Mother.

1358
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:07,380
It's Ethel.

1359
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:10,220
Oh, yes. Ethel, that's right.
My name is Ethel.

1360
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:12,740
That's better.
Are you ready... Ethel?

1361
01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:15,060
If you insist...
Walter.

1362
01:05:15,140 --> 01:05:16,300
Victor. It's Victor.

1363
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:17,260
Yes, Victor.

1364
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:18,420
Good night, Paul.

1365
01:05:19,940 --> 01:05:21,140
Shama shama, Corie.

1366
01:05:21,220 --> 01:05:22,100
Shama shama.

1367
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:23,980
If you don't hear
from us in a week,

1368
01:05:24,060 --> 01:05:26,380
we'll be at the Nacional Hotel
in Mexico City...

1369
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:27,980
Room 703.
Come on, Ethel.

1370
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:29,900
What did he mean
by that?

1371
01:05:29,980 --> 01:05:32,300
Stop worrying, Mother.
Call me in the morning.

1372
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:33,260
Oh...

1373
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:37,660
How about that?
He likes her!

1374
01:05:37,740 --> 01:05:39,620
He likes my mother!

1375
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:42,820
He'll probably
have to sleep over.

1376
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:45,380
Paul, do you
suppose that...

1377
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:46,660
Not my mother.

1378
01:05:50,860 --> 01:05:52,740
Boy, what a night!

1379
01:05:54,860 --> 01:05:57,700
I got an idea. Let's take the bottle
of Scotch downstairs

1380
01:05:57,740 --> 01:06:00,100
and ring all the bells
and yell "police. "

1381
01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:02,980
Huh? Just to see who comes out
of whose apartment?

1382
01:06:03,020 --> 01:06:05,380
What's the matter, darling?
Don't you feel well?

1383
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:07,300
What a rotten
thing to do,

1384
01:06:07,340 --> 01:06:10,980
dragging your mother out like that
into the middle of the harbor

1385
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:13,100
for a bowl
of sheep dip.

1386
01:06:16,620 --> 01:06:19,380
It was Greek bean soup.

1387
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:22,860
And at least
she tasted it.

1388
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:25,260
She didn't jab at it
with her knife

1389
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:26,820
throwing cute
little epigrams like,

1390
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:29,540
"Ho, ho, ho. I think
there's somebody in there. "

1391
01:06:29,620 --> 01:06:31,980
That's, um... quite
a match you made.

1392
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:34,380
I can just hear the conversation.
Sparkling dialogue.

1393
01:06:34,420 --> 01:06:36,780
He's telling her about some great
Japanese restaurant

1394
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:38,700
in East Berlin,
and she's describing

1395
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:41,260
the joys of having
a root canal job.

1396
01:06:43,620 --> 01:06:45,140
Give me your
hand, Ethel.

1397
01:06:45,220 --> 01:06:46,100
My what?

1398
01:06:46,180 --> 01:06:48,500
Your hand. There is ice
on the stoop.

1399
01:06:48,580 --> 01:06:50,460
Don't worry about me.
I can manage.

1400
01:06:50,540 --> 01:06:51,540
Ohhh!

1401
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:57,780
Ethel.

1402
01:06:57,860 --> 01:06:59,220
Are you all right?

1403
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:00,340
Uhhh...

1404
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:01,780
Ohhh...

1405
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:03,300
Well.

1406
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:15,860
I just can't
understand

1407
01:07:15,940 --> 01:07:18,420
how you can be so unconcerned
about all this.

1408
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:20,220
- Unconcerned?
- I really...

1409
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:22,780
Do you think
I'll get one wink of sleep

1410
01:07:22,860 --> 01:07:24,380
until that phone
rings tomorrow?

1411
01:07:24,460 --> 01:07:26,780
I'm scared to death
for my mother.

1412
01:07:26,860 --> 01:07:29,660
And I'm grateful there's finally
something to be scared about.

1413
01:07:31,060 --> 01:07:33,420
What I'm really
concerned about is you.

1414
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:36,340
Me?

1415
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:38,020
Me?

1416
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:39,620
Yeah. I'm beginning
to wonder

1417
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:42,060
if you're capable
of having a good time.

1418
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:44,940
Why? Because I like
to wear my gloves in winter?

1419
01:07:44,980 --> 01:07:48,300
No. Because there isn't the least bit
of adventure in you.

1420
01:07:48,340 --> 01:07:52,140
You know what you are, Paul?
You're a watcher.

1421
01:07:52,180 --> 01:07:54,660
You're a watcher.
There are watchers in this world,

1422
01:07:54,740 --> 01:07:55,940
and there are doers.

1423
01:07:56,020 --> 01:07:58,500
And the watchers
sit around watching the doers do.

1424
01:07:58,580 --> 01:08:00,460
Tonight you watched,
and I did.

1425
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:03,340
It was a little harder
to watch what you did

1426
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:06,220
than it was for you to do
what I was watching.

1427
01:08:06,260 --> 01:08:08,620
You can't even relax
for one evening.

1428
01:08:08,660 --> 01:08:11,140
I don't know, Paul,
sometimes you act like a...

1429
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:13,580
What? Hmm? A stuffed shirt?
Is that it?

1430
01:08:13,620 --> 01:08:14,820
I didn't say that.

1431
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:16,420
That's what you
were implying.

1432
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:17,700
That's what
you're anticipating.

1433
01:08:17,780 --> 01:08:19,300
I didn't say
stuffed shirt.

1434
01:08:19,380 --> 01:08:20,500
Mm-hmm.

1435
01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:23,300
But you're extremely
proper and dignified.

1436
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:30,220
Proper and dignified?
When was I proper and dignified?

1437
01:08:30,300 --> 01:08:32,780
The other night at Delfino's,
you were drunk, right?

1438
01:08:32,860 --> 01:08:34,060
Right.
I was stoned.

1439
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:35,940
Exactly. I didn't
even know it

1440
01:08:35,980 --> 01:08:38,380
until you told me
in the morning.

1441
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:41,260
Uhh... I mean, you're a funny kind
of drunk, Paul.

1442
01:08:41,340 --> 01:08:44,620
You just sat around looking unhappy,
watching your coat.

1443
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:46,220
I was watching
my coat

1444
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:48,620
because I saw someone else
watching my coat.

1445
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:51,180
If you want, I'll get drunk
for you sometime,

1446
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:53,100
make your hair
stand on end.

1447
01:08:53,180 --> 01:08:56,460
In Harry's Bar last New Year's Eve,
I punched an old woman.

1448
01:08:56,540 --> 01:08:58,060
Don't tell me
about drunk.

1449
01:09:00,620 --> 01:09:03,700
When else? When else
was I proper and dignified?

1450
01:09:03,780 --> 01:09:05,140
All the time.

1451
01:09:05,220 --> 01:09:06,580
You're always
dressed right.

1452
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:08,020
You always look right.

1453
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:10,780
You always say
the right thing.

1454
01:09:10,860 --> 01:09:12,540
You're very nearly
perfect.

1455
01:09:12,620 --> 01:09:15,700
That's a rotten
thing to say.

1456
01:09:15,780 --> 01:09:18,580
Before we were married,
I thought you slept with a tie.

1457
01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:20,100
Just for formal sleeps.

1458
01:09:20,180 --> 01:09:22,540
You have absolutely no sense
of the ridiculous.

1459
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:23,900
Like last
Thursday night,

1460
01:09:23,980 --> 01:09:27,100
you wouldn't walk barefoot with me in
Washington Square Park.

1461
01:09:27,180 --> 01:09:28,060
Why not?

1462
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:30,020
Simple answer.
It was 17 degrees.

1463
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:32,380
Exactly. It's very logical,
it's very sensible,

1464
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:33,580
and it's no fun.

1465
01:09:33,660 --> 01:09:35,500
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I am

1466
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:38,060
a little bit too proper
and dignified for you.

1467
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:39,660
Maybe you would've
been happier

1468
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:42,820
with somebody a little more colorful and
flamboyant... like the geek.

1469
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:45,740
It'd be a lot more laughs than
a stuffed shirt.

1470
01:09:45,780 --> 01:09:46,980
You said I wasn't.

1471
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:48,860
Well, you are now.

1472
01:09:48,940 --> 01:09:50,460
I'm not listening
to this.

1473
01:09:50,540 --> 01:09:52,860
I have a court case
in the morning.

1474
01:09:52,940 --> 01:09:54,140
Where are you going?

1475
01:09:54,220 --> 01:09:55,100
To sleep.

1476
01:09:55,180 --> 01:09:56,380
How can you now?

1477
01:09:56,460 --> 01:09:58,940
I'll close my eyes
and count knichis. Good night.

1478
01:09:59,020 --> 01:10:01,460
You cannot sleep now.
We're having a fight.

1479
01:10:01,540 --> 01:10:04,580
You have the fight. When you're
through, turn off these lights.

1480
01:10:04,660 --> 01:10:06,180
That gets me
absolutely insane!

1481
01:10:06,260 --> 01:10:08,340
You can even control
your emotions!

1482
01:10:08,420 --> 01:10:10,900
No, no. I'm just as upset
as you are.

1483
01:10:10,980 --> 01:10:13,780
But when I'm hungry, I eat.
When I'm tired, I sleep.

1484
01:10:13,860 --> 01:10:15,740
I've seen you
eat and sleep.

1485
01:10:15,820 --> 01:10:17,420
Not in midcrisis.

1486
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:19,500
What crisis?
We're just yelling.

1487
01:10:19,580 --> 01:10:21,300
You don't consider
this a crisis!

1488
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:23,540
Our whole marriage
is hanging in the balance.

1489
01:10:23,620 --> 01:10:24,500
It is?

1490
01:10:24,580 --> 01:10:25,940
When did this happen?

1491
01:10:26,020 --> 01:10:28,500
Just now. It's suddenly become
very clear to me

1492
01:10:28,580 --> 01:10:31,220
that you and I have
absolutely nothing in common.

1493
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:33,780
Because I won't
go walking barefoot in the park?

1494
01:10:33,860 --> 01:10:36,100
No case. Adultery, yes,
but cold feet, no.

1495
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:39,620
Don't you oversimplify this.
I am angry. Can't you see that?

1496
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:43,020
It's 2:15. If I can get to sleep
in half an hour,

1497
01:10:43,060 --> 01:10:44,860
I'll get
about 5 hours sleep.

1498
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:48,060
I'll call you from court tomorrow,
and we'll fight by phone.

1499
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:49,660
You won't go to sleep!

1500
01:10:49,740 --> 01:10:52,100
You'll stay here
and fight to save our marriage!

1501
01:10:52,180 --> 01:10:54,660
If our marriage hinges
on those fishbowls and pelmenchki,

1502
01:10:54,740 --> 01:10:58,060
it's not worth saving.
Care to join me in our tiny bed?

1503
01:10:58,100 --> 01:11:00,460
We're sleeping from left
to right tonight.

1504
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:04,300
You won't discuss it!
You're afraid to discuss it!

1505
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:06,180
I married a...
a coward!

1506
01:11:06,340 --> 01:11:08,780
Would you bring in a pail?
The closet's dripping.

1507
01:11:08,860 --> 01:11:10,220
Oh, I hate you!

1508
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:11,980
I really,
really hate you!

1509
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:13,900
There's one thing
I've learned in court.

1510
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:15,940
Be careful when
you're tired and angry.

1511
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:17,860
You may say something
you'll regret.

1512
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:19,460
I am now tired and angry.

1513
01:11:19,540 --> 01:11:21,060
And a coward!

1514
01:11:21,100 --> 01:11:22,180
Maybe you're right.

1515
01:11:22,220 --> 01:11:24,580
Maybe we don't have
anything in common.

1516
01:11:24,620 --> 01:11:26,020
Two people
should have more

1517
01:11:26,060 --> 01:11:27,860
than just
a blood test first.

1518
01:11:27,940 --> 01:11:30,260
Maybe they should
be checked first

1519
01:11:30,340 --> 01:11:32,180
for a little common sense,
understanding,

1520
01:11:32,260 --> 01:11:33,620
and emotional maturity!

1521
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:36,500
All right. Why don't
you get it passed

1522
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:37,940
by the Supreme Court?

1523
01:11:38,020 --> 01:11:40,820
Only those couples bearing a certificate
from their psychiatrist

1524
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:43,700
proving that they're
emotionally mature can be married.

1525
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:45,780
Oh, listen...

1526
01:11:45,860 --> 01:11:46,740
Don't touch me!

1527
01:11:46,820 --> 01:11:48,660
Don't lay
a finger on me!

1528
01:11:48,740 --> 01:11:51,060
I can't stand
to have you near me!

1529
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:54,740
I don't want to be
in the same room with you!

1530
01:11:54,820 --> 01:11:55,700
You're hysterical.

1531
01:11:55,780 --> 01:11:56,820
I am not hysterical!

1532
01:11:56,900 --> 01:11:58,740
I know exactly
what I'm saying.

1533
01:11:58,820 --> 01:12:00,180
It's all over
between us.

1534
01:12:00,260 --> 01:12:02,580
It's never going
to be any good anymore.

1535
01:12:02,660 --> 01:12:04,980
I'm sorry.
I don't want to cry.

1536
01:12:05,060 --> 01:12:06,180
Cry, please. Go ahead.

1537
01:12:06,260 --> 01:12:08,140
Don't tell me
when to cry!

1538
01:12:08,180 --> 01:12:10,540
I'll cry when
I feel like crying.

1539
01:12:10,580 --> 01:12:13,580
I won't cry until you're
out of this apartment.

1540
01:12:13,660 --> 01:12:15,100
What do you mean?

1541
01:12:15,180 --> 01:12:19,700
You certainly don't think we're
going to live here anymore, do you?

1542
01:12:19,780 --> 01:12:20,700
After this?

1543
01:12:20,780 --> 01:12:22,300
Are you serious?

1544
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:23,740
Of course
I'm serious, Paul!

1545
01:12:23,820 --> 01:12:25,100
I want a divorce!

1546
01:12:25,180 --> 01:12:26,340
Divorce!

1547
01:12:26,420 --> 01:12:28,100
I'm sorry.
I can't discuss it anymore.

1548
01:12:28,180 --> 01:12:29,420
Where are you going?

1549
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:30,380
To bed.

1550
01:12:30,460 --> 01:12:31,620
You can't, not now.

1551
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:33,100
You did before.

1552
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:34,180
During a fight.

1553
01:12:34,260 --> 01:12:35,660
This is during
a divorce.

1554
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:38,020
I can't talk to you when
you're hysterical.

1555
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:41,700
I want to know why
you want a divorce.

1556
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:43,780
Huh?

1557
01:12:46,100 --> 01:12:47,020
Why?

1558
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:52,300
Because you and I have absolutely
nothing in common.

1559
01:12:52,340 --> 01:12:53,740
Nothing in common?

1560
01:12:53,780 --> 01:12:57,100
What about the six days
at the Plaza, Corie?

1561
01:12:57,140 --> 01:12:59,980
Six days does
not a week make.

1562
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:03,020
What does that mean?

1563
01:13:06,260 --> 01:13:07,660
I don't know!

1564
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:10,060
I don't know
what it means.

1565
01:13:12,980 --> 01:13:16,300
All I know is
that I want a divorce.

1566
01:13:18,740 --> 01:13:21,580
You know,
I think you mean it.

1567
01:13:21,620 --> 01:13:22,940
You mean this?

1568
01:13:23,020 --> 01:13:24,860
I do.

1569
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:26,780
I really do.

1570
01:13:30,700 --> 01:13:32,540
Let's just...

1571
01:13:32,620 --> 01:13:33,820
think.

1572
01:13:39,340 --> 01:13:41,660
I thought you
weren't going to cry.

1573
01:13:41,740 --> 01:13:43,100
Well, I am!

1574
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:45,500
I'm going to have
the biggest cry

1575
01:13:45,580 --> 01:13:48,380
I've ever had
in my whole life,

1576
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:50,300
and I'm going
to enjoy it!

1577
01:13:50,380 --> 01:13:51,420
I'll cry so hard

1578
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:53,820
I'll keep you
awake all night.

1579
01:13:53,900 --> 01:13:55,580
Good night, Paul.

1580
01:13:55,660 --> 01:13:57,020
I mean goodbye.

1581
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:31,100
Six days does
not a week make.

1582
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:43,100
It's for you. I don't
live here anymore.

1583
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:49,780
Fine. Fine.

1584
01:14:51,340 --> 01:14:54,140
You work and work
for a lousy 6 cents.

1585
01:15:01,420 --> 01:15:04,220
I don't even care.

1586
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:06,140
I don't know...

1587
01:15:06,220 --> 01:15:07,580
why I even bother.

1588
01:15:07,660 --> 01:15:09,860
It's just...
it's just nothing.

1589
01:15:47,900 --> 01:15:49,740
One pound of grapes.

1590
01:15:49,820 --> 01:15:50,700
Anything else?

1591
01:15:50,780 --> 01:15:52,180
No, thank you.

1592
01:16:01,820 --> 01:16:04,140
Ah-choo!

1593
01:16:04,220 --> 01:16:06,540
God bless him.

1594
01:16:06,620 --> 01:16:09,420
If that's for tonight,
you needn't bother.

1595
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:10,860
I have my own dinner.

1596
01:16:10,940 --> 01:16:12,780
I thought you
were moving out.

1597
01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:17,060
I haven't had a chance
to look for a room yet.

1598
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:18,500
I work during the day.

1599
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:19,620
You'll look tonight.

1600
01:16:19,660 --> 01:16:21,540
I'm coming down
with a cold.

1601
01:16:21,580 --> 01:16:23,460
That's why
I'm home early.

1602
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:27,300
I thought I'd take aspirins and get
right into the sofa.

1603
01:16:27,340 --> 01:16:29,220
I'm sure you
can find someplace.

1604
01:16:29,260 --> 01:16:31,140
You can stay
at your club.

1605
01:16:31,180 --> 01:16:34,020
It's not that kind
of a club.

1606
01:16:34,060 --> 01:16:36,900
It's a locker room
and a handball court.

1607
01:16:36,940 --> 01:16:40,340
To sleep over, I'd have
to keep winning the serve.

1608
01:16:40,420 --> 01:16:42,260
Hello, Mrs. Bratter,
Mr. Bratter.

1609
01:16:42,340 --> 01:16:44,420
How's every
little thing?

1610
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:45,860
The little things
are fine.

1611
01:16:45,940 --> 01:16:48,300
Shall I charge it,
Mr. Bratter?

1612
01:16:48,340 --> 01:16:51,660
Charge it to Mrs. Bratter.
It's a new account.

1613
01:16:51,700 --> 01:16:53,460
The grapes are his.

1614
01:17:09,420 --> 01:17:10,460
It's open!

1615
01:17:12,140 --> 01:17:13,140
Hi.

1616
01:17:13,220 --> 01:17:14,100
Hello again.

1617
01:17:14,180 --> 01:17:15,540
Phone's out
of order.

1618
01:17:15,620 --> 01:17:16,980
Yeah. I know.

1619
01:17:17,060 --> 01:17:20,340
I wouldn't be up here
on a social call.

1620
01:17:20,420 --> 01:17:23,220
Hey, you did
a real nice job.

1621
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:24,180
Thank you.

1622
01:17:24,260 --> 01:17:27,060
Know anybody that
might want to rent it?

1623
01:17:27,140 --> 01:17:28,980
Rent it?
You moving already?

1624
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:31,380
I'm looking
for a smaller place.

1625
01:17:31,460 --> 01:17:34,260
Smaller than this,
they're not easy to find.

1626
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:36,660
How do you
like married life?

1627
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:37,900
Very interesting.

1628
01:17:40,580 --> 01:17:41,460
Hello.

1629
01:17:41,540 --> 01:17:42,580
I'm the
telephone man.

1630
01:17:42,660 --> 01:17:43,980
I'm the husband.

1631
01:17:45,660 --> 01:17:49,300
Well, let's see what's
wrong with the phone.

1632
01:18:07,860 --> 01:18:09,540
It's dead.

1633
01:18:09,580 --> 01:18:12,540
I know. It was
murdered last night.

1634
01:18:16,140 --> 01:18:19,460
I'll be out of here
as fast as I can.

1635
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:20,580
Take your time.

1636
01:18:20,620 --> 01:18:22,700
Nobody's rushing you.

1637
01:18:27,980 --> 01:18:31,580
Is there any beer
in the house?

1638
01:18:37,540 --> 01:18:40,860
I said, "Is there any beer
in the house?"

1639
01:18:43,340 --> 01:18:45,860
Would you
like me to look?

1640
01:18:45,940 --> 01:18:48,300
There's no beer
in the house.

1641
01:18:48,380 --> 01:18:50,660
There is no beer.

1642
01:18:56,300 --> 01:18:57,500
Ah!

1643
01:19:00,620 --> 01:19:01,980
That's my trouble... beer.

1644
01:19:02,060 --> 01:19:05,820
I can drink 10 cans
in a night... of beer.

1645
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:14,740
Ahh!

1646
01:19:26,460 --> 01:19:28,700
My laundry come back today?

1647
01:19:33,180 --> 01:19:35,980
Yes, your laundry
came back today.

1648
01:19:36,060 --> 01:19:38,740
They stuffed your shirts
beautifully.

1649
01:19:47,580 --> 01:19:50,300
Would you
like a drink?

1650
01:19:51,980 --> 01:19:54,180
I said, "Would you
like a drink?"

1651
01:19:54,220 --> 01:19:55,620
Who? Me?

1652
01:19:55,660 --> 01:19:56,660
Yeah.

1653
01:19:56,740 --> 01:19:57,700
No.

1654
01:19:57,780 --> 01:19:58,900
Right.

1655
01:20:04,380 --> 01:20:07,140
Just one more little screw
will do it.

1656
01:20:08,380 --> 01:20:09,740
There. I'm finished.

1657
01:20:09,820 --> 01:20:10,700
I'm finished.

1658
01:20:10,780 --> 01:20:13,700
Aah!

1659
01:20:17,260 --> 01:20:19,620
Hello. Yes, it is.

1660
01:20:19,660 --> 01:20:21,060
Just a moment.

1661
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:22,500
It's Aunt Harriet.

1662
01:20:22,540 --> 01:20:25,020
I don't have
an Aunt Harriet.

1663
01:20:28,780 --> 01:20:31,620
I guess you won't
be needing me anymore.

1664
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:32,580
Goodbye.

1665
01:20:32,620 --> 01:20:35,700
Aunt Harriet,
can you hang on a second?

1666
01:20:35,780 --> 01:20:38,500
When do I get it?

1667
01:20:38,540 --> 01:20:39,540
Get what?

1668
01:20:39,620 --> 01:20:41,300
When do I get my divorce?

1669
01:20:41,380 --> 01:20:42,300
I don't know.

1670
01:20:42,380 --> 01:20:44,020
They didn't send
the marriage license yet.

1671
01:20:44,100 --> 01:20:45,700
I want you out tonight.

1672
01:20:45,740 --> 01:20:47,140
Fine.
I'll get my bag.

1673
01:20:47,180 --> 01:20:49,060
I'll pack
my wet suits.

1674
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:50,340
Hi, Aunt Harriet.
What's wrong?

1675
01:20:50,380 --> 01:20:52,260
I'll go sleep
in the park,

1676
01:20:52,300 --> 01:20:54,180
where it's
dry and warm.

1677
01:20:54,220 --> 01:20:56,100
No, Mother's not with me.

1678
01:20:56,140 --> 01:20:58,500
She left about
2:00 this morning.

1679
01:20:58,540 --> 01:21:01,380
Yeah? What happened?

1680
01:21:01,420 --> 01:21:02,820
What?

1681
01:21:02,860 --> 01:21:05,140
Mother?

1682
01:21:05,220 --> 01:21:06,100
My mother?

1683
01:21:06,180 --> 01:21:07,540
Are you sure?

1684
01:21:07,620 --> 01:21:09,460
What's the matter?
What happened?

1685
01:21:09,540 --> 01:21:12,820
No. My phone's been
out of order all day.

1686
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:13,940
Don't get excited.

1687
01:21:14,020 --> 01:21:15,220
I'll call you back

1688
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:17,620
as soon as I find out
anything. Goodbye.

1689
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:19,060
What's wrong
with your mother?

1690
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:20,980
Mother didn't
come home last night.

1691
01:21:21,060 --> 01:21:22,740
Her bed hasn't
been slept in.

1692
01:21:22,820 --> 01:21:23,860
I'm calling the police.

1693
01:21:23,940 --> 01:21:26,260
Take it easy.
There's nothing to be...

1694
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:28,180
Maybe her back
was bothering her,

1695
01:21:28,260 --> 01:21:30,580
and she fell asleep
on the ironing board.

1696
01:21:30,660 --> 01:21:32,980
Would you just go away.
Just go away.

1697
01:21:33,060 --> 01:21:34,420
Where are you going?

1698
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:36,580
Upstairs to find out
what happened to mother.

1699
01:21:36,620 --> 01:21:38,020
You better not come back.

1700
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:40,180
I'm buying
a big dog tomorrow.

1701
01:21:40,260 --> 01:21:43,620
You'll have somebody
to walk barefoot in the park with.

1702
01:21:43,700 --> 01:21:45,100
A dog. That's a laugh.

1703
01:21:45,140 --> 01:21:47,980
When she tries
to take him for a walk,

1704
01:21:48,020 --> 01:21:49,780
he'll get one look
at those stairs

1705
01:21:49,860 --> 01:21:51,860
and go right
for her throat.

1706
01:21:54,180 --> 01:21:57,220
Mr. Velasco, can I see you
for a minute?

1707
01:21:57,260 --> 01:21:59,620
A little dog.
A little doggie.

1708
01:21:59,660 --> 01:22:01,940
I don't need anybody
to protect me, sweetheart,

1709
01:22:02,020 --> 01:22:06,020
because I am a man,
independent, mature,

1710
01:22:06,100 --> 01:22:09,220
self-sufficient
man... ah-choo!

1711
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:11,300
Oh! God bless me.

1712
01:22:11,380 --> 01:22:13,700
I've probably got the flu.

1713
01:22:13,780 --> 01:22:15,620
Yeah.

1714
01:22:15,700 --> 01:22:19,020
Chills, fever, sweaty.

1715
01:22:19,060 --> 01:22:21,380
Probably have
a 24-hour virus.

1716
01:22:23,380 --> 01:22:26,180
Better tomorrow
at a quarter to 4:00.

1717
01:22:27,700 --> 01:22:30,180
Oh!

1718
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:32,060
Thanks. Thanks a lot, pal.

1719
01:22:32,140 --> 01:22:33,940
And thus it was written.

1720
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:35,860
Some shall die
by pestilence,

1721
01:22:35,940 --> 01:22:37,300
some by the plague,

1722
01:22:37,380 --> 01:22:38,420
and one poor schnook

1723
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:41,780
will get it from a hole
in the ceiling.

1724
01:22:43,940 --> 01:22:44,820
Ahh!

1725
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:46,100
That's it. That's it.

1726
01:22:48,620 --> 01:22:50,060
Goodbye, leaky closet.

1727
01:22:52,140 --> 01:22:54,740
Bye, no bathtub.

1728
01:22:54,820 --> 01:22:55,940
Bye, hole.

1729
01:22:57,220 --> 01:22:59,940
Goodbye, six flights.

1730
01:23:00,020 --> 01:23:00,900
Oh!

1731
01:23:00,980 --> 01:23:01,860
Goodbye,
Corie.

1732
01:23:01,940 --> 01:23:03,300
Oh, no goodbye?

1733
01:23:03,380 --> 01:23:05,260
According to law,
I'm entitled to...

1734
01:23:05,300 --> 01:23:06,180
Goodbye!

1735
01:23:07,700 --> 01:23:08,580
What?

1736
01:23:08,660 --> 01:23:10,340
Is it your mother?

1737
01:23:10,420 --> 01:23:12,740
Corie, what is it,
an accident?

1738
01:23:12,820 --> 01:23:14,700
For Pete's sake,
what's it about?

1739
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:17,580
It's not the way
it looks at all!

1740
01:23:17,620 --> 01:23:18,500
Boo-hoo!

1741
01:23:18,580 --> 01:23:19,460
Good God.

1742
01:23:19,540 --> 01:23:21,420
Corie, you've
got to believe me.

1743
01:23:21,460 --> 01:23:22,900
Somebody believe me.

1744
01:23:26,220 --> 01:23:28,100
I warned her.

1745
01:23:28,140 --> 01:23:30,980
I warned her,
and I was right.

1746
01:23:31,420 --> 01:23:33,340
He warned me,
and he was right.

1747
01:23:33,420 --> 01:23:35,300
It must have
been the drinks.

1748
01:23:35,340 --> 01:23:38,180
I had a great deal
to drink last night...

1749
01:23:38,220 --> 01:23:40,540
Martinis, vodka, coffee,
black bean soup, and ouzos.

1750
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:44,420
That's not
my problem.

1751
01:23:44,460 --> 01:23:46,820
I'm well
out of it now.

1752
01:23:49,740 --> 01:23:50,860
Ahh!

1753
01:24:01,580 --> 01:24:02,620
Then after I fell,

1754
01:24:02,700 --> 01:24:05,060
Victor picked me up
and carried me inside.

1755
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:08,420
I couldn't walk because
my shoes fell down the sewer.

1756
01:24:08,460 --> 01:24:09,860
You don't have
to explain.

1757
01:24:09,900 --> 01:24:11,780
He started
to carry me here,

1758
01:24:11,820 --> 01:24:14,180
but his hat
fell over his eyes,

1759
01:24:14,220 --> 01:24:17,060
and we fell down the stairs
into apartment 3C.

1760
01:24:17,100 --> 01:24:18,500
I fell on his foot.

1761
01:24:18,540 --> 01:24:20,900
I thought we'd
have a nice evening.

1762
01:24:20,940 --> 01:24:22,820
Mr. Gonzales, Mr. Armandariz,
and Mr. Calhoun

1763
01:24:22,860 --> 01:24:24,260
carried us both
up there

1764
01:24:24,300 --> 01:24:26,660
and put us down
on the rugs.

1765
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:28,580
When I awoke,
Victor was gone,

1766
01:24:28,620 --> 01:24:30,980
and I was there
in his bathrobe.

1767
01:24:31,020 --> 01:24:33,540
I swear that's
the truth, Corie!

1768
01:24:38,220 --> 01:24:39,620
Got a cold.

1769
01:24:39,660 --> 01:24:42,020
I've had one
for 20 years.

1770
01:24:48,780 --> 01:24:51,140
Ahh!

1771
01:24:51,180 --> 01:24:54,900
Gee, that's a nice coat
you got there.

1772
01:24:54,980 --> 01:24:56,340
What?

1773
01:24:56,420 --> 01:24:57,300
Huh?

1774
01:24:57,380 --> 01:24:58,260
Your coat.

1775
01:24:58,340 --> 01:25:02,100
I'll make you a trade.
What have you got?

1776
01:25:02,180 --> 01:25:03,860
Nothing.

1777
01:25:03,940 --> 01:25:05,340
It's a deal!

1778
01:25:07,980 --> 01:25:10,820
You must believe me.
I've told you everything.

1779
01:25:10,860 --> 01:25:12,260
Then where
are your clothes?

1780
01:25:12,300 --> 01:25:14,180
That I can't tell you.

1781
01:25:14,220 --> 01:25:15,140
Why not?

1782
01:25:15,180 --> 01:25:16,580
You won't believe me.

1783
01:25:16,620 --> 01:25:18,980
I will. Mother,
where are your clothes?

1784
01:25:19,020 --> 01:25:20,420
I don't know.

1785
01:25:20,460 --> 01:25:21,860
I don't believe you.

1786
01:25:21,900 --> 01:25:24,740
Didn't I tell you
you wouldn't believe me?

1787
01:25:24,780 --> 01:25:26,660
I don't know
where they are.

1788
01:25:26,700 --> 01:25:28,580
I've never
been so humiliated.

1789
01:25:28,620 --> 01:25:31,460
I kept having
the most horrible nightmares.

1790
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:34,340
I kept dreaming
my fingers were falling off

1791
01:25:34,380 --> 01:25:37,140
because I couldn't
make a fist. Ohh!

1792
01:25:38,340 --> 01:25:39,620
It's me.

1793
01:25:44,060 --> 01:25:46,260
Mr. Velasco,
are you all right?

1794
01:25:46,340 --> 01:25:50,100
If a broken toe
is all right, I'm fine.

1795
01:25:50,180 --> 01:25:50,980
Hello, Ethel.

1796
01:25:51,060 --> 01:25:52,420
Hello, Victor...
Mr. Victor...

1797
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:53,380
Mr. Velasco.

1798
01:25:53,460 --> 01:25:55,780
I couldn't get up
the ladder again.

1799
01:25:55,860 --> 01:25:58,180
Did you tell Corie
what happened last night?

1800
01:25:58,260 --> 01:25:59,620
Why? What happened
last night?

1801
01:25:59,700 --> 01:26:00,580
Ooh, last night.
Yes.

1802
01:26:00,660 --> 01:26:01,700
Take his arm,
Mother.

1803
01:26:01,780 --> 01:26:05,380
I knew I would come to this,
being helped by women.

1804
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:07,780
Oh, dear, does
your foot hurt?

1805
01:26:07,860 --> 01:26:09,660
Compared
to my stomach, no.

1806
01:26:09,740 --> 01:26:12,060
I think I have
a new ailment

1807
01:26:12,140 --> 01:26:13,980
which I shall call
"intestinal volcano. "

1808
01:26:14,060 --> 01:26:16,380
Are there little men
in there

1809
01:26:16,460 --> 01:26:18,300
running around
in spiked shoes?

1810
01:26:18,380 --> 01:26:19,740
And pointy
steel helmets,

1811
01:26:19,820 --> 01:26:22,620
and they keep
jumping up and down, up and down.

1812
01:26:22,700 --> 01:26:25,500
How long has
this been going on?

1813
01:26:25,580 --> 01:26:26,940
Hardly ever,
except after meals.

1814
01:26:27,020 --> 01:26:28,100
Welcome to my club.

1815
01:26:28,180 --> 01:26:30,500
I think
you have an ulcer.

1816
01:26:30,580 --> 01:26:31,940
An ulcer? Me?
From what?

1817
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:33,220
Too many
spicy foods.

1818
01:26:33,300 --> 01:26:34,660
You'll have
to get used

1819
01:26:34,740 --> 01:26:36,580
to taking
little pink pills.

1820
01:26:36,660 --> 01:26:38,020
Oh, I'd rather die,

1821
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:40,900
but first I must get
rid of this headache.

1822
01:26:40,980 --> 01:26:43,140
Do you have
about 300 aspirins?

1823
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:46,260
I'm not as young
as I think I am.

1824
01:26:46,340 --> 01:26:47,700
Why do you say that?

1825
01:26:47,780 --> 01:26:49,060
Isn't it obvious?

1826
01:26:49,140 --> 01:26:52,420
Last night, I couldn't
carry you up the stairs.

1827
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:54,820
I can't eat
rich food anymore.

1828
01:26:54,900 --> 01:26:56,700
I dye my hair, my...

1829
01:26:56,780 --> 01:26:58,140
Well, it's very nice.

1830
01:26:58,220 --> 01:26:59,100
Thank you.

1831
01:26:59,180 --> 01:27:00,540
So are you.

1832
01:27:00,620 --> 01:27:04,540
You know, Ethel, you are
a very unusual woman.

1833
01:27:04,620 --> 01:27:05,820
Unusual? In what way?

1834
01:27:05,900 --> 01:27:08,060
I took a long look
at you last night.

1835
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:09,980
Do you know
what you are?

1836
01:27:10,060 --> 01:27:10,940
What?

1837
01:27:11,020 --> 01:27:11,900
A good sport.

1838
01:27:11,980 --> 01:27:13,020
Oh, a good sport.

1839
01:27:13,100 --> 01:27:16,380
To have gone through
all you did last night...

1840
01:27:16,460 --> 01:27:17,820
the trip to Staten Island,
the strange food,

1841
01:27:17,900 --> 01:27:22,140
being carried up
to my apartment like that.

1842
01:27:22,220 --> 01:27:23,580
If you remember, eh?

1843
01:27:23,660 --> 01:27:25,260
Ha ha ha!

1844
01:27:28,460 --> 01:27:31,580
Mr. Velasco,
where are my clothes?

1845
01:27:31,660 --> 01:27:34,460
Oh, your clothes. Here.

1846
01:27:34,540 --> 01:27:37,340
I'm sure I wore
more than that.

1847
01:27:37,420 --> 01:27:39,060
It's a cleaning ticket.

1848
01:27:39,140 --> 01:27:41,460
They're sending them up
at 4:00.

1849
01:27:41,540 --> 01:27:43,380
Oh, they're
at the cleaners.

1850
01:27:43,460 --> 01:27:45,220
When did I
take them off?

1851
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:48,020
You didn't. You were
drenched and out cold.

1852
01:27:48,100 --> 01:27:49,700
Gonzales took them off.

1853
01:27:49,740 --> 01:27:50,740
Mr. Gonzales?

1854
01:27:50,820 --> 01:27:52,180
Not Mister... Dr. Gonzales.

1855
01:27:52,260 --> 01:27:53,620
Oh, the doctor.
Dr. Gonzales.

1856
01:27:53,700 --> 01:27:55,060
I guess that's
all right, then.

1857
01:27:55,140 --> 01:27:57,860
How convenient to have
an M.D. In the building.

1858
01:27:57,900 --> 01:27:59,300
He is not an M.D.

1859
01:27:59,340 --> 01:28:01,700
He's a doctor
of philosophy.

1860
01:28:05,300 --> 01:28:06,660
Ha ha ha!

1861
01:28:06,740 --> 01:28:07,620
Here. Aspirin.

1862
01:28:07,700 --> 01:28:09,060
No, thank you.

1863
01:28:09,140 --> 01:28:10,500
I'm feeling
much better now.

1864
01:28:10,580 --> 01:28:11,940
I'll take them.

1865
01:28:12,020 --> 01:28:13,380
Well, I must go.

1866
01:28:13,460 --> 01:28:16,260
Someone is calling
about renting my apartment.

1867
01:28:16,340 --> 01:28:19,180
From now on,
I take elevators.

1868
01:28:19,260 --> 01:28:20,860
Ooh!

1869
01:28:20,940 --> 01:28:22,980
Is there anything
I can do for you?

1870
01:28:24,060 --> 01:28:25,420
Yes, there is.

1871
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:28,380
Would you like to have
dinner with me tonight?

1872
01:28:28,460 --> 01:28:29,220
Me?

1873
01:28:29,300 --> 01:28:31,620
If you don't mind
eating plain food.

1874
01:28:31,700 --> 01:28:34,460
I love plain food.

1875
01:28:34,540 --> 01:28:37,900
Good. I'll call the New York Hospital
for a reservation.

1876
01:28:37,980 --> 01:28:39,660
I'll pick you up at 7:00.

1877
01:28:39,740 --> 01:28:41,540
Whatever you say,
Victor.

1878
01:28:41,620 --> 01:28:42,980
Now, that's funny.

1879
01:28:43,060 --> 01:28:45,540
I was getting
used to Walter.

1880
01:28:47,540 --> 01:28:51,780
You know what I
could use right now?

1881
01:28:51,820 --> 01:28:53,900
A double ouzo.

1882
01:28:56,820 --> 01:29:00,100
What I really could use
is a new outfit.

1883
01:29:00,180 --> 01:29:02,300
Mother,
can I talk to you?

1884
01:29:02,380 --> 01:29:06,140
Do you realize I slept without
a board last night?

1885
01:29:06,220 --> 01:29:08,540
For the first time
in years,

1886
01:29:08,620 --> 01:29:09,980
I slept
without a board!

1887
01:29:10,060 --> 01:29:11,100
You don't suppose

1888
01:29:11,180 --> 01:29:14,460
ouzo is some kind
of Greek miracle drug, do you?

1889
01:29:14,540 --> 01:29:17,340
There's something
I've got to talk to you about.

1890
01:29:17,420 --> 01:29:19,820
How sweet of you.
You're worried about me.

1891
01:29:19,900 --> 01:29:21,700
I'm not worried about you.

1892
01:29:21,740 --> 01:29:23,140
Oh, my hair.

1893
01:29:23,180 --> 01:29:26,100
I wonder what I
could do with my hair?

1894
01:29:26,180 --> 01:29:29,020
Paul and I are
getting a divorce.

1895
01:29:29,100 --> 01:29:31,620
A divorce?

1896
01:29:31,700 --> 01:29:32,580
That's right.

1897
01:29:32,660 --> 01:29:36,260
Paul and I
are splitting up for good.

1898
01:29:36,340 --> 01:29:37,340
You and Paul?

1899
01:29:37,420 --> 01:29:38,500
I don't believe you.

1900
01:29:38,580 --> 01:29:40,580
You saw him leave
with his suitcase.

1901
01:29:40,660 --> 01:29:43,420
What did you think
he had in there?

1902
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:45,340
I know how neat he is.

1903
01:29:45,420 --> 01:29:47,140
I thought
maybe the garbage.

1904
01:29:47,180 --> 01:29:51,580
Mother, I believe you.
Why don't you believe me?

1905
01:29:51,660 --> 01:29:53,020
Because
in my entire life,

1906
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:57,700
I've never seen two people more in love
than you and Paul.

1907
01:29:59,420 --> 01:30:02,220
Well, maybe that
was true yesterday,

1908
01:30:02,300 --> 01:30:05,100
but it sure
isn't true today.

1909
01:30:06,500 --> 01:30:10,380
It couldn't have
been all your fault.

1910
01:30:10,460 --> 01:30:14,220
No? Because of me, you were
running around without your clothes

1911
01:30:14,300 --> 01:30:18,060
and Paul is out there
in the streets with a cold,

1912
01:30:18,140 --> 01:30:20,460
looking for a place
to sleep.

1913
01:30:20,540 --> 01:30:21,900
Whose fault is that?

1914
01:30:21,980 --> 01:30:23,820
Yours.

1915
01:30:23,900 --> 01:30:27,180
You want to know something
that may shock you?

1916
01:30:27,260 --> 01:30:28,860
I still love you.

1917
01:30:28,940 --> 01:30:30,780
And Paul loves you, too.

1918
01:30:30,860 --> 01:30:33,420
And I love him.

1919
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:35,340
I don't know
what he wants.

1920
01:30:35,420 --> 01:30:39,140
I don't know how
to make him happy.

1921
01:30:39,180 --> 01:30:42,020
What am I going
to do, Mother?

1922
01:30:42,060 --> 01:30:44,900
That's the first time
you've asked my advice

1923
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:46,340
since you were 10.

1924
01:30:50,220 --> 01:30:51,620
It's really very simple.

1925
01:30:51,660 --> 01:30:53,060
All you have to do

1926
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:58,340
is give up a little bit
of you for him.

1927
01:30:58,380 --> 01:31:00,260
Don't make
everything a game,

1928
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:03,620
just late at night
in that little room upstairs,

1929
01:31:03,660 --> 01:31:05,540
take care of him.

1930
01:31:05,580 --> 01:31:07,460
Make him feel...

1931
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:08,580
important.

1932
01:31:08,620 --> 01:31:10,500
If you can do that,

1933
01:31:10,540 --> 01:31:13,380
you'll have a happy
and wonderful marriage,

1934
01:31:13,420 --> 01:31:16,260
like 2 out
of every 10 couples.

1935
01:31:16,300 --> 01:31:19,140
You'll be one
of the two, baby.

1936
01:31:21,420 --> 01:31:24,740
Now get out of here
and go find him.

1937
01:31:24,780 --> 01:31:26,500
I've got a date.

1938
01:31:27,660 --> 01:31:30,940
Aunt Harriet isn't going
to believe a word of this.

1939
01:31:31,020 --> 01:31:33,340
If you don't hear
from me tomorrow,

1940
01:31:33,420 --> 01:31:36,620
I'll be in the Nacional Hotel
in Mexico City,

1941
01:31:36,700 --> 01:31:38,540
Room 703.

1942
01:32:43,860 --> 01:32:45,860
Ha ha ha!

1943
01:32:45,940 --> 01:32:47,780
Ha ha ha!

1944
01:32:47,860 --> 01:32:50,020
Ha ha ha!

1945
01:32:53,940 --> 01:32:55,300
Paul!

1946
01:32:55,380 --> 01:32:57,700
It is you!

1947
01:32:57,780 --> 01:32:59,620
I doubt that very much.

1948
01:32:59,700 --> 01:33:02,020
I've been looking
for you everywhere.

1949
01:33:02,100 --> 01:33:02,980
Oh, yeah?

1950
01:33:03,060 --> 01:33:05,380
Oh, well,
you'll never find me.

1951
01:33:05,460 --> 01:33:06,820
Ha ha ha!

1952
01:33:06,900 --> 01:33:07,780
Your coat!

1953
01:33:07,860 --> 01:33:09,220
Where's your coat?

1954
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:11,140
Coat?

1955
01:33:11,220 --> 01:33:14,020
I don't need a coat.

1956
01:33:14,100 --> 01:33:15,860
It's only 2 degrees.

1957
01:33:17,460 --> 01:33:19,300
What have you
been doing?

1958
01:33:19,380 --> 01:33:20,260
Oh.

1959
01:33:20,340 --> 01:33:23,140
Oh. Ha ha ha!

1960
01:33:23,220 --> 01:33:25,060
What have I been doing?

1961
01:33:25,140 --> 01:33:27,460
Just what have I been doing?

1962
01:33:27,540 --> 01:33:31,820
I've been walking
barefoot in the park.

1963
01:33:31,900 --> 01:33:33,460
Paul, you're crazy.

1964
01:33:33,540 --> 01:33:34,660
Shh!

1965
01:33:36,180 --> 01:33:38,660
But guess what I am?

1966
01:33:38,740 --> 01:33:40,580
You're drunk.

1967
01:33:40,620 --> 01:33:42,500
Ha ha ha!

1968
01:33:42,540 --> 01:33:44,420
You finally noticed!

1969
01:33:44,500 --> 01:33:45,980
Ha ha ha!

1970
01:33:48,780 --> 01:33:51,260
You're lousy,
stinking drunk.

1971
01:33:53,940 --> 01:33:55,940
Yee eeh!

1972
01:33:56,020 --> 01:33:58,820
Oh, I see you
still have your shoes.

1973
01:33:58,900 --> 01:34:01,500
Boy, what a stuffed shirt.

1974
01:34:05,260 --> 01:34:06,460
Paul, no!

1975
01:34:08,300 --> 01:34:09,820
Paul!

1976
01:34:15,340 --> 01:34:16,900
Paul?

1977
01:34:16,980 --> 01:34:19,300
Paul, are you all right?

1978
01:34:19,380 --> 01:34:21,700
Corie, I got to
tell you something.

1979
01:34:21,780 --> 01:34:22,820
No, later.

1980
01:34:22,900 --> 01:34:25,220
No, now. I got
to tell you now.

1981
01:34:25,300 --> 01:34:27,620
I got all the way
down the stairs,

1982
01:34:27,700 --> 01:34:29,340
suddenly it hit me.

1983
01:34:29,420 --> 01:34:34,140
Suddenly I saw everything clearly
for the first time.

1984
01:34:34,220 --> 01:34:37,020
I said to myself
this is crazy.

1985
01:34:37,100 --> 01:34:38,580
This is crazy.

1986
01:34:38,660 --> 01:34:42,340
It's all wrong
for me to run away like this.

1987
01:34:42,380 --> 01:34:44,740
There's only one
right thing to do.

1988
01:34:44,780 --> 01:34:47,100
Really, Paul? What?

1989
01:34:47,180 --> 01:34:48,580
You get out.

1990
01:34:48,620 --> 01:34:51,460
Ha ha ha
ha ha ha ha ha.

1991
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:53,220
Ha ha ha ha.

1992
01:34:55,340 --> 01:34:56,860
Ah-choo!

1993
01:35:04,940 --> 01:35:06,620
Why should I get out?

1994
01:35:06,700 --> 01:35:09,060
The lease is in my name.

1995
01:35:13,100 --> 01:35:14,620
I'm going home.

1996
01:35:19,340 --> 01:35:20,980
Drop in anytime.

1997
01:35:22,700 --> 01:35:24,380
You know
my address.

1998
01:35:33,340 --> 01:35:36,940
After all, a man's
home is his castle.

1999
01:35:37,020 --> 01:35:39,340
I'm home, castle.

2000
01:35:39,420 --> 01:35:42,220
Oh! Oh, still here?

2001
01:35:42,300 --> 01:35:44,620
Well, I will...

2002
01:35:44,700 --> 01:35:47,980
I will give you
10 minutes

2003
01:35:48,060 --> 01:35:50,860
to pack up
your pelmenchki

2004
01:35:50,940 --> 01:35:52,780
and go.

2005
01:35:52,860 --> 01:35:54,700
Ah-choo!

2006
01:35:54,780 --> 01:35:57,100
Paul, you're burning up
with a fever.

2007
01:35:57,180 --> 01:35:58,540
How about that?

2008
01:35:58,620 --> 01:35:59,980
You're going
to get pneumonia.

2009
01:36:00,060 --> 01:36:02,860
If that's what you want,
that's what I'll get.

2010
01:36:02,940 --> 01:36:05,900
Paul, take your shoes off.
They're soaking wet.

2011
01:36:05,980 --> 01:36:07,820
I can't. My feet
have swellened.

2012
01:36:07,900 --> 01:36:10,220
I never should
have let you out.

2013
01:36:10,300 --> 01:36:11,660
I've got an idea.

2014
01:36:11,740 --> 01:36:14,060
Let's do that thing
you said before.

2015
01:36:14,140 --> 01:36:15,500
Let's wake the police

2016
01:36:15,580 --> 01:36:17,380
and see if they come out
of the crazy neighbors.

2017
01:36:17,460 --> 01:36:19,300
This building
is under arrest!

2018
01:36:19,380 --> 01:36:20,620
Everybody out!

2019
01:36:20,700 --> 01:36:21,740
- What?
- Paul...

2020
01:36:21,820 --> 01:36:23,180
Will you
get into bed?

2021
01:36:23,260 --> 01:36:24,580
You get in first.

2022
01:36:24,620 --> 01:36:26,020
- You're sick.
- Not that sick.

2023
01:36:26,060 --> 01:36:27,940
No, stop it!

2024
01:36:27,980 --> 01:36:29,300
Stop it.

2025
01:36:29,380 --> 01:36:31,380
I mean it. Stop it.

2026
01:36:34,060 --> 01:36:35,460
Ha! Come here, cutie.

2027
01:36:35,500 --> 01:36:37,380
Come on, Paul,
stop it.

2028
01:36:37,420 --> 01:36:39,300
No! I'm
warning you.

2029
01:36:39,340 --> 01:36:41,700
Hey, you're pretty when
you're mean and rotten.

2030
01:36:41,740 --> 01:36:43,620
Keep away from me!
I'll scream!

2031
01:36:43,660 --> 01:36:45,540
Shh! There's snow
on the roof.

2032
01:36:45,580 --> 01:36:46,980
We'll have
an avalanche.

2033
01:36:47,020 --> 01:36:50,340
You're not supposed
to be walking around. You got a fever.

2034
01:36:50,380 --> 01:36:52,260
Stand still,
the both of you.

2035
01:37:00,620 --> 01:37:02,020
Hey...

2036
01:37:02,060 --> 01:37:03,460
Open this door.

2037
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:04,900
I can't.
I'm scared.

2038
01:37:04,940 --> 01:37:06,020
Of me?

2039
01:37:06,060 --> 01:37:06,980
Yes.

2040
01:37:07,020 --> 01:37:08,100
Why?

2041
01:37:08,140 --> 01:37:09,540
It's not you
anymore.

2042
01:37:09,580 --> 01:37:11,940
I want the old
Paul back.

2043
01:37:11,980 --> 01:37:14,340
That fuddy-duddy?

2044
01:37:14,380 --> 01:37:16,740
He's not a fuddy-duddy.
He's strong and dependable.

2045
01:37:16,780 --> 01:37:18,180
He takes care of me

2046
01:37:18,220 --> 01:37:19,940
and protects me
from people like you.

2047
01:37:19,980 --> 01:37:23,220
I want him to know
how much I love him.

2048
01:37:23,300 --> 01:37:26,260
I'll make everything
exactly the way he wants it.

2049
01:37:26,340 --> 01:37:28,660
I'll fix the hole
in the skylight

2050
01:37:28,740 --> 01:37:30,580
and the leak
in the closet.

2051
01:37:30,660 --> 01:37:32,500
I'll put in a bathtub.

2052
01:37:32,580 --> 01:37:34,420
I'll carry him upstairs
every night,

2053
01:37:34,500 --> 01:37:36,820
'cause that's
how much I love him.

2054
01:37:40,580 --> 01:37:42,340
Paul?

2055
01:37:46,500 --> 01:37:47,620
Paul?

2056
01:37:51,180 --> 01:37:52,380
Hey...

2057
01:37:55,780 --> 01:37:57,060
Paul?

2058
01:38:00,900 --> 01:38:02,020
Paul!

2059
01:38:02,060 --> 01:38:03,780
Aah!

2060
01:38:03,820 --> 01:38:06,780
You're going
to kill yourself! Come down!

2061
01:38:06,860 --> 01:38:09,660
No, I want to be a nut,

2062
01:38:09,740 --> 01:38:12,540
just like everybody else
in this building!

2063
01:38:12,620 --> 01:38:13,780
Aah!

2064
01:38:13,860 --> 01:38:17,820
No, I don't want you
to be a nut. Come down.

2065
01:38:17,900 --> 01:38:19,660
No.

2066
01:38:19,740 --> 01:38:22,060
Not until you've
said it again,

2067
01:38:22,140 --> 01:38:24,740
loud and clear.

2068
01:38:24,780 --> 01:38:26,140
Anything, Paul,
anything.

2069
01:38:26,220 --> 01:38:28,420
My husband...

2070
01:38:28,500 --> 01:38:29,940
My husband...

2071
01:38:30,020 --> 01:38:31,380
Ah-choo!

2072
01:38:31,460 --> 01:38:33,220
Paul Bratter...

2073
01:38:33,260 --> 01:38:34,660
Paul Bratter...

2074
01:38:34,700 --> 01:38:37,180
rising young attorney...

2075
01:38:37,260 --> 01:38:40,100
Aah!
Rising young...

2076
01:38:40,180 --> 01:38:42,460
rising young attorney...

2077
01:38:44,500 --> 01:38:47,700
is a lousy,
stinking drunk.

2078
01:38:47,780 --> 01:38:50,100
Is a lousy,
stinking drunk,

2079
01:38:50,180 --> 01:38:51,940
and I love him.

2080
01:38:53,620 --> 01:38:55,940
I love you,
too, Corie.

2081
01:38:56,020 --> 01:38:59,420
Even when I didn't like you,
I loved you.

2082
01:38:59,500 --> 01:39:02,020
Then, Paul, would
you please come down?

2083
01:39:06,580 --> 01:39:08,500
I can't, not now.

2084
01:39:08,580 --> 01:39:09,500
Why?

2085
01:39:09,580 --> 01:39:11,580
'Cause I'm
going to be sick.

2086
01:39:11,660 --> 01:39:12,660
Oh, no!

2087
01:39:12,740 --> 01:39:13,860
Oh, yes.

2088
01:39:13,900 --> 01:39:17,220
Don't move. I'll be right up
there to get you.

2089
01:39:17,260 --> 01:39:20,740
Would you do that,
'cause I'm getting panicky.

2090
01:39:20,820 --> 01:39:22,660
Paul, I'm coming.
I'm coming.

2091
01:39:24,140 --> 01:39:25,500
Corie? Cor-Corie?

2092
01:39:25,580 --> 01:39:26,780
Corie!

2093
01:39:26,860 --> 01:39:28,260
What? What, Paul, what?

2094
01:39:28,340 --> 01:39:30,180
Don't leave me.

2095
01:39:30,260 --> 01:39:32,100
You're going
to be all right.

2096
01:39:32,180 --> 01:39:34,340
Just hold on tight
and be calm.

2097
01:39:34,420 --> 01:39:37,340
How?
Wh-what should I do?

2098
01:39:37,420 --> 01:39:39,260
What should he do?

2099
01:39:39,340 --> 01:39:41,500
What should he do?
Sing.

2100
01:39:41,580 --> 01:39:42,980
Sing?

2101
01:39:43,020 --> 01:39:44,900
Sing as
loud as you can.

2102
01:39:44,940 --> 01:39:47,380
Don't stop till I get there.
Promise you'll keep singing.

2103
01:39:47,460 --> 01:39:49,220
I promise.

2104
01:39:49,260 --> 01:39:51,620
O.K., don't stop
until I get there.

2105
01:39:51,660 --> 01:39:53,860
I love you, darling.
Keep singing.

2106
01:39:53,940 --> 01:39:55,300
Corie? Corie, Corie!

2107
01:39:55,380 --> 01:39:56,260
Corie!

2108
01:39:56,340 --> 01:39:57,460
What, Paul?

2109
01:39:57,540 --> 01:39:59,420
What song should I sing?

2110
01:40:00,820 --> 01:40:02,180
Shama shama.

2111
01:40:02,220 --> 01:40:03,700
Sh...

2112
01:40:03,780 --> 01:40:04,980
Shama?

2113
01:40:05,060 --> 01:40:07,380
Sing it, Paul.

What's happening?

2131
01:40:40,540 --> 01:40:41,900
I don't know.

2132
01:40:41,980 --> 01:40:43,940
They're looking up
at this house.

2133
01:40:44,020 --> 01:40:46,340
