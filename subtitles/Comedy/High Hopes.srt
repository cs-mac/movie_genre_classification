1
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,199
Excuse me.

2
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,879
Do you know where Ballswood House is?

3
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,999
- Ballswood House?
- Yeah.

4
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,839
What, it's round here, is it?

5
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,839
Yeah.

6
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,079
It's near King's Cross.

7
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,119
Ain't you got no street name?

8
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,559
No what?

9
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,719
This all you got?
Ain't you got no directions?

10
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,999
No, that's it.

11
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,959
Hang on.

12
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,959
Come with me. Come on.

13
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,359
Come on, then.

14
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,359
You heard of a Ballswood House?

15
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,359
Ballswood? What's that - a joke?

16
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,479
No, there's a geezer here
looking for Ballswood House.

17
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,079
Oh, hello. Come in.

18
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,879
Ballswood.

19
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,559
There's Ballspond Road.

20
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,919
I've got that.

21
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,919
Come in. Put your bag down.
Shut the door.

22
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,519
There's no Ballswood.

23
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,039
- Sit down. Want a cup of tea?
- Yes, please.

24
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,799
Go on, sit down.

25
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,199
Thanks.

26
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,359
- Who give you that?
- My mum.

27
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,919
- You on your holidays?
- He's looking for his sister.

28
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,959
I've come to get a job.

29
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,559
Where are you from?

30
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,039
- Byfleet.
- Where's that?

31
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,959
- Surrey, innit.
- Is it?

32
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,959
So you've come to London looking for work?
You'll be lucky, mate.

33
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,879
I'm gonna get a job on a building site.
Vivien said.

34
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,319
Who's Vivien?

35
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,639
My sister, Vivien Bennett.
Do you know her?

36
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,439
No.

37
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,279
Help yourself to a biscuit.

38
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,959
Thanks.

39
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,159
What's that?

40
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,359
It's a cactus, innit?

41
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,039
Guess what its name is.
- Dunno.

42
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,319
Thatcher.

43
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,599
Cos it's a pain in the arse.
Prongs you every time you walk past it.

44
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,359
That bit's Den is.

45
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,959
Is it?

46
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,239
That's Bollock, Dick, Turd, Brains.
That's Willy. That's Knob.

47
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,999
They've all got names.

48
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,879
Did your mum
write that down for you?

49
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,119
- Yeah.
There's a bit missing.

50
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,519
Is there?

51
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,639
She ain't put
the street name down.

52
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,319
How do you mean?

53
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,359
Ballswood House is a block of flats.

54
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,519
No, it's a house. 29, Ballswood House.

55
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,599
Yeah, but it's in a street,
and you ain't got the street name.

56
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,079
Oh, yeah.

57
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,119
When you've had your tea,
go down the station. Ask a cabbie.

58
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,639
They know all the flats.

59
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,879
Who are they?

60
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,839
Cabbies. Taxi drivers.

61
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,079
- You'll be all right.
- Yeah.

62
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,199
Right, then right again.

63
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,359
- Right.
- No, left and left.

64
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,519
- It's quicker to go right.
- No, it ain't.

65
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,799
- It don't make no difference, does it?
- No, it don't, does it?

66
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,079
All right, go left, then left again.

67
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,919
Then again,
you could go right and right.

68
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,799
Whatever, it's just over the back.

69
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,399
See you. Here, what's your name?

70
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,239
Wayne. What's yours?

71
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,359
Shirley. That's Cyril.

72
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,559
Pleased to meet you.

73
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,959
Hello.

74
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,999
Mind how you go, then.

75
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,439
Bye.

76
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,199
Take care of yourself.

77
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,319
Thanks.

78
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,839
Bye.

79
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,679
I bet you a quid he goes left.
- Right, you're on.

80
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,999
Go on, my son. Yes!

81
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,759
What's he doing?

82
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,879
I don't believe it!

83
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,479
Go on, Wayne.

84
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,759
Want to come and see my old lady,
get it over with?

85
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,199
Give us my pound first.

86
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,319
Got no change, have I?

87
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,079
Mum?

88
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,519
How have you been? All right?

89
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,679
Could be better.

90
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,239
Ain't you been well?

91
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,119
- What's the matter?

92
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,319
Nothing.

93
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,439
That's all right then, innit?

94
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,759
Do you want anything?
Want a cup of tea?

95
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,159
Why, what's the time?

96
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,799
It's about three o'clock.

97
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,559
No, it's too early for me.

98
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,399
Please yourself.

99
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,999
It'll spoil my tea, won't it?

100
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,119
Yeah.

101
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,519
You can have one, if you like.

102
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,759
- No, I don't want one.
- I'll have one.

103
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,519
- You want one, do you?
- One sugar.

104
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,839
Biscuit?

105
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,399
Got any chocolate biscuits?

106
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,799
- No.
- Oh, it don't matter.

107
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,279
- You'll have to have plain, then.
- Anything will do.

108
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,879
Save me a couple for my tea.

109
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,999
Yeah, all right, all right.

110
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,119
Been out anywhere, then?

111
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,239
When?

112
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,519
I don't know - yesterday, Friday?

113
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,399
Oh. I thought you meant today.

114
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,159
No.

115
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,319
Where would I go on a Sunday?

116
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,759
Church?

117
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,799
Only joking.

118
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,079
We can't stop long. We just popped round
to see if you were all right.

119
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,439
We only just got here.

120
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,199
You heard from Valerie yet?

121
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,879
No.

122
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,799
You're better off, ain't you?

123
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,239
She can suit herself.

124
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,359
Yeah, she will.

125
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,039
The big seven-O soon, innit?

126
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,119
What's that?

127
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,639
It's your birthday coming up.

128
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,919
Yeah. Be getting a telegram
from the Queen, I expect.

129
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,839
Good mate of yours, is she, the Queen?

130
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,639
When are you going to
smarten yourself up?

131
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:43,039
The day they machine-gun the Royal Family,
I'll comb my hair and put a tie on.

132
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,399
Feel better?

133
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,319
You've been asleep for a couple of hours.

134
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,839
I haven't.

135
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,399
You have.

136
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,959
Shut up.

137
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,079
He's winding you up.

138
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,439
I only shut my eyes for a minute.

139
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,239
What are you doing?

140
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,479
Just looking at these window boxes, ain't I?

141
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,879
- I don't think no-one's in.
- There never is of a weekend.

142
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,919
No, they've gone to their country mansion.

143
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,719
This was a different street
when I was a kid.

144
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,959
Before the middle classes took over.

145
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,159
I bet your mum's
the only council tenant left round here.

146
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,159
Here, have a look at this.

147
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,359
A pity your mum ain't got
central heating, eh?

148
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,039
Ain't the same, is it?

149
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,639
Why do they want to live around here?

150
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,119
They buy these houses for sod all
and sell them for a fortune.

151
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,879
It ain't a home, though.

152
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,399
No, it ain't.
It's a capital investment.

153
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,959
My thumb's aching. Is yours?

154
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,079
Come on, then.

155
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,839
I bet your mum did vote Tory last year.

156
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,439
Course she did.

157
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,519
She wasn't even gonna vote.
We took her round there.

158
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,959
If she'd voted Labour,
she'd have owned up.

159
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,079
Yeah.

160
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,959
Working-class Tories
stabbing themselves in the back.

161
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,639
What did your mum used to work at?

162
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,519
She never had no job.

163
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,719
How about when she first left school?

164
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,879
She worked in a canteen.

165
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,759
Oh, yeah.

166
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,879
It was during the war.

167
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,759
She stayed at home
after she had your Valerie, didn’t she?

168
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,359
I don't know if I'd go back to work or not.

169
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,279
What do you mean?

170
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,199
After I've had a kid, of course.

171
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,519
You ain't got a kid yet.

172
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,159
I know I ain't got a kid yet.

173
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,279
So what are you talking about?

174
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,519
You know what I'm talking about.

175
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,079
It's an over-populated world as it is.

176
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,679
- Oh, wotcha.
- All right?

177
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,879
- What, no luck?
- No.

178
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,639
Couldn't you find it?

179
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,359
No, I found it.

180
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,319
You'd better come in, then.

181
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,119
Thanks.

182
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,359
- You don't live your life to please your mum.
- Cyril don't.

183
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,399
If you've got nowhere to go, you go home.

184
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,039
I can't, really.

185
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,479
- Have you had a row with your mum?
- Sort of.

186
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,479
Yeah? Because you ain't got a job?

187
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,959
- No, cos I got the pies wrong.
- What pies?

188
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:30,759
I was supposed to get steak and kidney pies,
and I got pork pies instead.

189
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,119
That was last week.

190
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,599
Your mum spoke to your sister on the phone,
didn’t she?

191
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,439
When was that?
- Last week.

192
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,319
And your sister knew you was coming?

193
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,479
Yeah.

194
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,559
- How do you know?
- Because my mum said.

195
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,959
Ring your mum
and tell her your sister wasn't in.

196
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,639
- I can't do that.
- Why?

197
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,439
Cos we're not on the phone.

198
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,399
Maybe we ought to
let him stay here tonight.

199
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,759
I think so.

200
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,239
Well, you can stay here tonight,
if you want.

201
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,439
Sleep with Cyril.

202
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,599
Leave it out. We've got another room.
There's a mattress in there.

203
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,319
Is there? Thanks.

204
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,079
Better than walking the streets.

205
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,119
Want a biscuit?
- No, thanks.

206
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,479
- Ain't you hungry?
- No, I had a Wimpy.

207
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,199
What are you doing?

208
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,319
- What am I doing?
- Yeah.

209
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,359
I'm gonna get out of it, Wayne.

210
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,519
How do you mean?

211
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,239
Did you go to that Wimpy
down by the station?

212
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,159
Yeah. There's a lot of people about,
aren't there?

213
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,279
Yeah.

214
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,599
Was you hassled?
Did anyone give you any aggravation?

215
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,679
Yeah. This bloke started staring at me.
And then he said something.

216
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,479
- What did he say?
- Don't know. I didn’t understand.

217
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,279
There's a lot of dodgy geezers about.

218
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,919
You've got to be careful.

219
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:57,439
If your sister ain't in tomorrow,
you'd better go back to Byfleet.

220
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,959
- I can't do that.
- Why?

221
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,039
My mum would be annoyed with me.

222
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,879
Was you wearing them on the way here?

223
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,079
Yeah, I was.

224
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,599
Bright, aren't they?

225
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,919
Shut up, they're nice.

226
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,199
That'll do. Right, right, lay down.

227
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,199
Put your arms in. That's it.

228
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,319
That's it.

229
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,239
One.

230
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,319
Two.

231
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,799
There.

232
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,919
Can I have my stereo, please?

233
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,559
That's a bit smart, innit?

234
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,119
It's a ghetto blaster.

235
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,239
Thanks.

236
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,559
- Goodnight, then.
- Night, Wayne.

237
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,999
Sleep tight.

238
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,599
Hope the fleas don't bite.

239
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,559
What did he say?

240
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,999
He said he hopes the fleas don't bite!

241
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,879
Hark at him.

242
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,679
"Turn that radio off!"

243
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,399
"Wayne, I'll give you a smack!"

244
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,279
"What do you think this is, a bleedin' disco?"

245
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,399
Shut up.

246
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,679
Don't laugh.

247
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,199
He'd get on your wick, though, wouldn’t he?

248
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,839
I hope I don't have a kid that's a bit thick.

249
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,079
Cyril?

250
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,119
Wake up.

251
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,239
He's still asleep. See you.

252
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,639
Your tea's getting cold.

253
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,759
You remember where it is, Ballswood House?

254
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,399
Yeah, just round the corner. Not far, really.

255
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,199
- Let's hope she's there, eh?
- I expect she is.

256
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:27,399
This is Cyril to Greased Lightning.
Cyril to Greased Lightning, over.

257
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,359
If she ain't, you get on the bus
and go back to Byfleet.

258
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,679
Roger. And bloody hurry up!

259
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,799
Yeah, I'm on my bike. Over and out.

260
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,359
Who was you speaking to?

261
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,079
My office.

262
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,959
How fast can this bike go?

263
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,399
- This?
- Yeah.

264
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,279
As fast as I want it to.

265
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,399
Mind your back, then.

266
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,279
I think he'll find it completely overbearing.

267
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,999
I disagree. He'll be tremendously amused.

268
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:31,679
Whereas, one can hardly call Rosie a lady.

269
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,519
I'd like you to give me a hand with these things.

270
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,119
I'll take the pheasant.

271
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,559
Boo! Hi, Mum.

272
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,599
- You're looking well.
- You made me jump.

273
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,399
God, look at me.

274
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,239
They think they own the whole bleedin' street.

275
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,839
Couldn’t you leave him outside?

276
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,639
How many times do I have to tell you?
He is a she, right?

277
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,359
It took me a week to get
all them hairs off the furniture.

278
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,679
It'll give you something to do, won't it?

279
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,679
There you are.

280
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,599
What are they saying about my baby?

281
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,319
What's this?

282
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,159
Happy Christmas.

283
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,719
It's nearly February.

284
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,799
So? Listen, Mum, what are you saying?

285
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,119
Bit late, innit?

286
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,439
You've got it now.

287
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,839
You could have come to us
on Christmas Day, and you didn't.

288
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,079
Do you want it now or dont you?

289
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,279
I don't care.

290
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,879
It's always the same.
You never care. You never have cared.

291
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,839
Well, please yourself.

292
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,719
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

293
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,399
- Are you going in?
- No, I phoned Jeremy.

294
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,839
What did you say?

295
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,119
I told him
something rather urgent had cropped up.

296
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,679
Just a minute.

297
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,119
What do you mean?

298
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,759
I've got a surprise for you.

299
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,239
Where are you going?

300
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,359
Stay where you are.

301
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,919
I like surprises.

302
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,799
When are you coming over?

303
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,519
Dunno.

304
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,119
What about Sunday week?

305
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,919
I'll pick you up.

306
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,479
I'm not going with Martin.

307
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,399
I said I'll pick you up.

308
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,519
Come and get me!

309
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,559
Mr Sausage, hello!

310
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,319
Mr Sausage is on the stairs!

311
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,759
Naughty Mr Sausage!

312
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,039
Very naughty Mr Sausage.

313
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,479
Mr Sausage deserves a smack.

314
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,239
On his botty!

315
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,439
Mr Sausage is coming to get you!

316
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,079
No, he's not.

317
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,239
- Yes, he is.
- No, he isn't.

318
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,799
Yes, he is!

319
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,799
I'm coming to get Mr Sausage.

320
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,159
Oh, jolly good!

321
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,479
Are you gonna open your present or not?

322
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,039
What is it?

323
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,079
It's for your blood pressure.

324
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,639
Look.

325
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,479
Let's open it.

326
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,679
See?

327
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,879
Are you pleased with it? Are you?

328
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,879
Do you want to sign for that?

329
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,519
Just wait a moment, can't you?

330
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,479
Now.

331
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,759
- There you are.
- Terrific.

332
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,399
I don't know what you're on about.
I gave you 100 on Friday.

333
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,519
- So?
- Where's it gone?

334
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,159
- I want you.
- Don't start all that.

335
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,919
- I only want 50.
- Look, I'm busy.

336
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,319
Where are the customers?

337
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,239
- What do you want money for?
- Your dinner's round your mouth.

338
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,239
- Where are you going?
- Shopping.

339
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,679
Use plastic.

340
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,439
I can't. I left them at home.

341
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,599
Go and get them. You've nothing better to do!

342
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,639
- Give me some cash!
- Get off!

343
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,559
Christ, you don't half pong!
What have you got on?

344
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,959
Here's a tenner.

345
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,959
Hi!

346
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,279
Christ, I'm starving.

347
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,479
What's the matter with you?

348
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,599
Nothing. Do you want your dinner?

349
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,679
Course I do.
I could eat a horse between two mattresses.

350
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,959
What have you got?

351
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,439
Something special.

352
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,159
- Wheel it in.
- Are you ready?

353
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,279
And willing.

354
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,519
- What's this?
- Your dinner.

355
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,039
- You trying to be funny?
- No.

356
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,839
- What are you laughing at?
- I'm not laughing.

357
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,039
Typical! You can't take a joke.

358
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:11,519
Take a joke? I can take a joke.
I don't get this joke.

359
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,879
If you don't give me cash,
you get bread and water.

360
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,119
You're round the bloody twist.
I give you a bleedin' fortune.

361
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,839
I'm hungry. Give us that bread!

362
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,359
- No.
- Why not?

363
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,159
Because I have cooked your dinner.

364
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,479
Ben appetito.

365
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,919
I don't want it.

366
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,039
What?

367
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,359
I ain't hungry.

368
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,719
What do you mean?

369
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,839
I had some peanuts in the pub.

370
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,439
Are you gonna eat this or not?

371
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,559
No.

372
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,439
Right!

373
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,279
Baby!

374
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,519
Look what Mummy's cooked for you. Yes!

375
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,439
I want my prescription made up.

376
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,359
It's in my purse.

377
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,159
Must be in the other one.

378
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,679
It's in here somewhere.

379
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,239
Where is it?

380
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,199
- What?
- My purse.

381
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,079
It's got my prescription in it.

382
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,879
Maybe you left it at your house.

383
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,279
I put it in my bag.

384
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,239
I'm sure I did.

385
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,719
That's fine.

386
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,439
Excuse me. Just a minute.

387
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,319
I'm sorry?

388
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,279
I've locked myself out.

389
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,719
- Pardon?
- I can't get in.

390
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,039
Ah. That's not a very clever thing
to have done, is it?

391
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,039
Have you forgotten your keys?

392
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,319
I left my purse on top of the telly.

393
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:36,039
- Couldn't get my pills from the chemist.
- But what have you done with your keys?

394
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,199
In my purse.

395
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,319
Ah. Well erm...

396
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,439
Have you seen a policeman?

397
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,079
Not around here.

398
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,639
Aren't there any neighbours you know
who could help?

399
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,159
Not any more.

400
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:53,639
Is there anyone you know
who has another set of keys?

401
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,399
- My son...
- I'm sorry?

402
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,639
- My son and my daughter.
- Where are they?

403
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,079
My son'll be at work.

404
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,519
What about your daughter?

405
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,159
She might be anywhere.

406
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,079
Is she on the telephone?

407
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,679
Yeah.

408
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:11,639
Might I suggest you give her a ring and tell her
to come here with a set of keys pronto?

409
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,679
But I can't get in.

410
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,039
I'm sorry?

411
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,999
I can't get in my house.

412
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,639
There are such things as telephone booths,
you know.

413
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,959
I ain't got no money.

414
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,359
- Why ever not?
- It's in my purse.

415
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,999
You have got yourself into a pickle,
haven't you?

416
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,639
Well...

417
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:37,279
if you'd like to give me your daughter's number,
I'll give her a quick ring.

418
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,599
I don't know her number.
It's in my book indoors.

419
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,679
Is she in the telephone directory?

420
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,559
I expect so.

421
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,999
Right.

422
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,359
Well...

423
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,519
.. I suppose you'd better come in,
just for a moment.

424
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,479
Chop chop.

425
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:20,479
No, we can't have that thing
in the house, thank you.

426
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,919
- It might get pinched.
- Don't be absurd!

427
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,279
Hello?

428
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,879
Mrs Burke?

429
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,679
Who wants to know?

430
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:48,439
This is Laetitia Boothe-Brain,
your mother's next-door neighbour.

431
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,959
Oh, hi!

432
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:54,719
I have your mother sitting here in my kitchen.
It appears she has locked herself out.

433
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:55,999
So?

434
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,839
Don't you have a spare key?

435
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,239
What if I have?

436
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,399
Perhaps you'd like to bring it over.

437
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,559
Is she being a nuisance or something?

438
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:07,079
No, not as yet, but I am a little pushed.

439
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,199
Hello?

440
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,919
How long are you likely to be?

441
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,479
Excuse me, did I say I was coming?

442
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,599
Well, if you're not, who is?

443
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:22,399
OK, no hassle, we'll send someone over.
All right?

444
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,319
Jolly good. Post haste.

445
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,439
- What?
- Bye-bye.

446
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,039
It's rather a large house for one person,
don't you agree?

447
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,719
I manage.

448
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,279
Milk?

449
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,319
Yes, please.

450
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,239
But you can hardly justify having
three bed rooms, though, can you?

451
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,919
It's my home.

452
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,719
Yes, it is at the moment,
I grant you that. Sugar?

453
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:59,279
I'm not sure it wouldn't be better appreciated
by a professional couple or even a family.

454
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,399
Biscuit?

455
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,399
Thank you.

456
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,559
I've always lived there.

457
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,879
Yes, that's as may be, but times change.

458
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,479
I think you'd be the first to agree

459
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:24,919
you'd be far better off buying yourself
a nice little modern granny flat.

460
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,879
Where would I get the money from?

461
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:33,919
If you were to put your house on the market,
you'll find you've been sitting on a gold mine.

462
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:38,079
Do you have all your original features?

463
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,759
Cornices? Fireplaces?

464
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,839
I've got fireplaces, yeah.

465
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,399
Et voilà. Bring in the estate agents.

466
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,359
It's not my house.

467
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,639
Ah, it belongs to a member of your family?

468
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,679
It belongs to the council.

469
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,479
Oh!

470
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:03,919
Well, mercifully, you people have the opportunity
to purchase your council property nowadays.

471
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,239
I'd snap it up, if I were you.

472
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,959
Then, of course, one resells.

473
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,639
Do you think I could use your toilet?

474
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,879
Ah, the lavatory.

475
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,959
Yah, I'll show you where it is in a minute.

476
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,279
Hello, Burke's Burgers, can I help you?

477
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,239
- Hi!
- What do you want?

478
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,919
Who does Cyril work for?

479
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,159
I dunno, Greasy Pole or something. Why?

480
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,879
- He's got to go round to Mum's.
- What for?

481
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,599
She's had a serious accident.

482
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,359
Is she in hospital?

483
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,079
She's locked out
with that yuppie woman next door.

484
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,399
- Big deal.
- Look, it's a matter of life and death.

485
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,839
Leave it out.

486
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,639
If she dies, on your head be it.

487
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,159
Why don't you go round?

488
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,599
Please!

489
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,759
He could be anywhere, he might be in Timbuktu.
Oi, mind that fat!

490
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,799
Are you gonna get hold of him or not?

491
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,079
I'll try, but...

492
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,479
I love you.

493
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,599
Hang on a minute...

494
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,359
Cyril. Come in, Cyril.

495
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,959
Your old mum's had some bloody accident.
Over.

496
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,719
- Yeah, what's happened to her?
- Dunno. She's next door. Number 55, is it?

497
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,359
I'd better shoot over there. I'm bailing out.

498
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:23,479
You know, if you really don't have the capacity
to remember things,

499
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,199
you ought to put them on a chain
round your neck.

500
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,719
How was your lunch?

501
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,959
- Minimalistic, to say the least.
- Oh, God.

502
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,919
- Not that bloody awful nouvelle cuisine?
- Yah.

503
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,359
You must be ravenous.

504
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:40,879
- I did manage a couple of oysters.
- Ah, well done. I had a dozen.

505
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,919
- Oh, did you really?
- Yah.

506
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,959
The most enormous Chateaubriand.

507
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,399
Everybody else had some bilious-looking fish.

508
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,879
You'll never guess
who Aunt Amanda brought along.

509
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,679
- Who?
- Arrowminta de Winter.

510
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,799
- Really?
- Yah.

511
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,519
- I had no idea they were friends.
- Oh, they've been chums for years.

512
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:00,879
Minty is trying to coax me into doing
some charity work for her.

513
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,799
- Charity work?
- Spring function at Grosvenor House.

514
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,719
I said the only thing I felt sure of

515
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:09,719
was being able to solicit a couple of cases
of something bubbly from my husband.

516
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,359
Did you, indeed?

517
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:14,039
I think that's awfully presumptuous of you.

518
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,879
To whom are we giving this time?

519
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,039
Mentally-handicapped something-or-other.

520
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,959
- Do they drink champagne?
- Yes, I expect so.

521
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,719
Put me down.

522
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,879
Seen anything you like?

523
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,839
I can't see very well without my other glasses.

524
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,679
Oh, you've left those inside as well, have you?

525
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,359
Don't bring them out, as a rule.

526
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,719
We are an old scatterbrain today, aren't we?

527
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,719
When can we expect these keys to arrive?

528
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,919
Well, a.s.a.p, hopefully.

529
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,039
The traffic's appalling.

530
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,119
- All right like this, am I?
- No, DJ, I think.

531
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,319
Do you? Well, put it out, would you?

532
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,319
We're going to the opera.

533
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,079
Jeremy Ructon-Barrington will have to go.

534
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,759
- Do tell.
- Cracking jokes in French.

535
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,079
None of which were remotely amusing.

536
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:08,199
Though I must say the frog teetotaller
guffawed profusely.

537
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:12,879
Anyway, Lance and I are having lunch
next week at the club.

538
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,199
Oh, Jeremy's days are numbered, I feel.

539
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,319
Absolutely.

540
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,679
Now...

541
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,759
how about getting outside with a brush
and giving the front of your house a lick of paint?

542
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,959
- Smarten it up a little bit, eh?
- Yah.

543
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,519
And your garden
leaves a great deal to be desired.

544
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,399
You could have enormous fun out there.

545
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,439
Do you have green fingers?

546
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,799
- My husband used to do all that.
- Ah.

547
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,559
Where is he now?

548
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,319
- He's dead.
- Jolly good.

549
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:44,239
- Where shall we eat afterwards?
- You choose.

550
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,679
The cavalry has arrived.

551
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,399
- Oh, hi.
- Ah.

552
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,839
- I came as soon as I could.
- Thank you.

553
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,479
- Laetitia.
- Yah.

554
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,519
- Help is at hand.
- Ah. Er, hello.

555
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,319
- Hi.
- Have you brought the keys?

556
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,919
- Well, I'm not stupid, am I?
- Jolly good.

557
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,079
- Well, done.
- Hello, Mum.

558
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,119
- Hello.
- Who's been a silly girl, then?

559
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,199
I don't think it'll happen again in a hurry.

560
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,519
- What a nice little room.
- Thank you, very much.

561
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:28,719
It's amazing what you can do with a slum,
isn't it?

562
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:32,079
- So, how long have you been here now?
- About 18 months.

563
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,519
Oh, so long.

564
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,079
So... you like it round here, then?

565
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,639
Yes, we find it extremely satisfactory.

566
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,999
Each to his own.

567
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,759
I don't wish to appear rude,

568
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:45,199
but my husband and I do have an engagement
and I've yet to take my bath.

569
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,879
I didn’t want to come here in the first place,
did I?

570
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:52,599
And I just want to say...
thank you for your hospitality.

571
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,519
Oh... er, it's my pleasure.

572
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,679
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

573
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,959
Full steam ahead!

574
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,999
What are you trying to do to me?

575
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,599
I don't believe this!

576
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,559
- What?
- I've only forgotten the key.

577
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,439
- You haven't,
- I have, if you must know.

578
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,679
Wait here.

579
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,039
And keep your mouth shut.

580
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,159
- May I use your phone?
- The phone?

581
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,399
- What's the problem?
- You won't believe this.

582
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,479
- What?
- She's changed the lock.

583
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,559
- Oh, for goodness' sake!
- Extraordinary.

584
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:43,559
Well, our problem is, I'm afraid,
we're rather strapped for time.

585
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,639
- Absolutely.
- It'll only take a minute.

586
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,599
- Don't you have a phone next door?
- Yeah, but we're locked out.

587
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,639
- You brought the keys...
- The wrong one.

588
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,359
- Oh, bad luck.
- Well, quickly, quickly!

589
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,119
In you come.

590
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,439
- What's happening, Valerie?
- Shut up.

591
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,799
- Who's coming with the keys?
- Trust me for once in your life.

592
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,959
.. working tomorrow
and tomorrow keeps on this petty pace.

593
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,559
Oh, really?

594
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:19,719
If we miss the overture, I suggest
we cut our losses go straight out to dinner.

595
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:23,759
- Yes, I'm well aware of the situation, Rupert.
- Those seats cost £150.

596
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,239
- So what goes on down there?
- That's my husband's study.

597
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,639
Oh, look what they've done to your coal hole,
Mum.

598
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,399
- Can I take a little peek?
- Ah, well...

599
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,759
Rupert!

600
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:40,959
Oh, this is a fun room, isn't it?

601
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,999
- Yah.
- So what do you get up to down here, then?

602
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,159
You're not gonna tell me, are you?

603
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,199
- I bet you keep him on a tight rein.
- For goodness' sake, my bath!

604
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,559
Titty.

605
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,719
- That's a nice suit.
- Thank you.

606
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,359
- Are you in the City?
- No.

607
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,759
I'm in wine, as a matter of fact.

608
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,879
Oh, permanently pickled.

609
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:15,119
- What are you doing?
- I think we're neglecting your mother.

610
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,719
Well, we wouldn’t want to do that, would we?

611
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:15,159
- Are you the biker with the infamous key?
- Yeah. What's happened to her?

612
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,679
- Nothing. She's tiptop.
- Excuse me.

613
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,399
- Do you mind?
- No, do you?

614
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,919
- What you doing here?
- Hi, Shirl.

615
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:24,519
Now, are you quite sure
you brought the right key?

616
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,679
- What are you on about?
- For the door.

617
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,999
- Are you taking the piss?
- What?

618
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,759
- Where's my mum?

619
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,799
Now, look here, I really have no idea
where your mother is,

620
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,799
who she may be,
or indeed whether you have one.

621
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,279
- You want a fat lip?
- What?

622
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,239
- You heard.
- Rupert, don't get involved.

623
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,479
Titty.

624
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:47,119
Now... what made this country great
was a place for everyone

625
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:49,159
and everyone in his place.

626
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,399
And this is my place.

627
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:51,959
- Hear, hear!
- Fascist.

628
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,439
No, he's not, is he?

629
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,999
- Is that Cyril?
- Is this your mother?

630
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:58,039
- Yeah.
- Well, take her away.

631
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,639
And kindly remove that ridiculous
Heath Robinson contraption

632
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,159
from off my property.

633
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,199
- Do you own this, then?
- Yes, we do.

634
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,159
I thought it was Council.

635
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:10,519
- What the bloody hell's going on?
- Forgot her key.

636
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,279
I'll take that, Mrs Bender.

637
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,559
I thought you'd had an accident or something.

638
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:20,199
- And where's your key?
- Oh, hi, Cyril. Long time no see.

639
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,319
I'll put the kettle on.

640
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:25,159
Oi, I'm talking to you.

641
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,719
Are you cold, Mrs Bender?

642
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,759
- I bet she's got her key with her.
- Yeah, she might have.

643
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,439
What happened?

644
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,199
Didn't they treat you right next door?

645
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,319
Mum?

646
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,559
What's the matter?

647
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,319
Your dad ain't come in yet, has he?

648
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,559
I ain't done the potatoes.

649
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,599
Don't be so daft.

650
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,199
Here, give me my purse.

651
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:24,519
And hurry up.

652
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,959
He's not on a late turn, is he?

653
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,319
He's dead, Mum.

654
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,319
Where's my prescription?

655
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,279
There's your keys.

656
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,359
Who's that?

657
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:44,079
- Is this Rene?
- It's Shirley.

658
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,759
You're not too big for a good hiding, you know.

659
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:53,879
Shirl!

660
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,079
- What?
- Come and give us a hand.

661
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,879
I'll give her a right-hander.

662
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,319
I need someone to carry the tray.

663
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,919
You carry the tray!

664
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:06,439
- What's the matter with you?
- Don't kick up such a row.

665
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,159
Sorry.

666
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:11,159
- Want to take your hat off, then?
- No.

667
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,159
Oh, all right.

668
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,879
There's your tea, Mum. I've left the bag in.

669
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,119
- I've had enough tea for one day.
- You don't have to drink it.

670
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,439
- Oi. What are you up to?
- What do you mean?

671
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:27,959
- You know what I mean.
- Yeah.

672
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:30,999
What is this?
Some kind of interrogation or something?

673
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:34,039
- How's your blood pressure, Mum, eh?
- I asked you a question.

674
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,399
- Not in front of Mum, all right?
- Why?

675
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:39,679
- We need to talk.
- So start talking.

676
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,199
Not here.

677
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:43,439
All right. We'll go outside.

678
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:44,879
OK.

679
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:48,279
- Won't be a sec, Mum.
- I'll wait here, eh?

680
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,399
No, come on.

681
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,679
Sunday week, I'm throwing a surprise party
for Mum's 70th birthday

682
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,199
and I want you both to be there. OK?

683
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,079
I want to know who phoned my office.

684
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,759
- Well, I didn’t.
- Well, who did?

685
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:11,959
- Martin.
- They said she'd had an accident.

686
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:14,439
- I didn’t tell him that.
- What did you tell him?

687
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,719
- Oh, he is a bastard.
- Well, what did you say?

688
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:18,759
I told him the truth. What else would I say?

689
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,119
- Of course. What else?
- Thanks, Shirl.

690
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:25,079
- You're out of your mind, you know that?
- Well, it takes one to know one, Cyril.

691
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,119
Are you coming Sunday week or not?

692
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,159
Oh, leave it out.

693
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,559
Try to get him to be there, Shirl.

694
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,279
About 4:30, for Mum's sake. OK?

695
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,399
Bye.

696
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,399
I'll give you a ring, Mum.

697
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,039
- All right?
- Oh, no.

698
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:53,639
Cyril. You'll never guess.

699
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:56,959
- In you come.
- Thanks.

700
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,639
- All right?
- Yes, thanks.

701
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:04,999
- Feel better now?
- Yeah.

702
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:07,759
Good. You shouldn't eat too many Wimpys.

703
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:10,199
- Yeah, I was all full up.
- Wash your hands, then.

704
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,079
Thanks.

705
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:15,719
That's it. Here. Dry your hands on that.

706
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:19,239
- We'll take a walk round there with you, Wayne.
- Yeah.

707
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:21,279
- Round where?
- Round Vivien's.

708
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,919
- Yeah, but she's not in.
- We'll find out, won't we.

709
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:26,039
There you are. Put your coat on.

710
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:31,999
- Can't we go round there tomorrow?
- Come on. Hurry up.

711
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,559
It's freezing out there.

712
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:41,319
Don't look so worried.

713
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:49,399
We should leave.

714
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:52,199
- Come on.
- What if she comes back tonight?

715
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,239
Go on, go. Go. Drive him away.

716
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,959
'Ere, you know who he reminds me of?

717
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,639
- Who?
- ET.

718
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,959
Go home, ET.

719
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,919
- See you, Wayne.
- He's gonna get off.

720
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:30,319
Oh, leave it out.

721
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:07,359
Should we go to that party? At Valerie's.

722
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:08,879
Leave it out.

723
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,559
Well, it might be a good laugh.

724
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:17,039
- You just want to have a look at her house.
- Yeah.

725
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:20,399
- Have a good gander about.
- No, I was thinking about your mum.

726
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,279
She won't notice if we're there or not.

727
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,319
She'll notice if you ain't there.

728
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,759
Get in.

729
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,599
Thank you, very much.

730
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,999
What made this country great...

731
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:45,639
.. was a place for everyone...

732
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:48,479
And everyone in his place.

733
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,679
- And this...
- Is my place.

734
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,679
- Quite right.
- Wanna go back to our place?

735
00:50:56,080 --> 00:51:00,799
Say ye who borrow

736
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:06,399
Love's witching spell

737
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:11,279
What is this sorrow

738
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:15,919
Nought can dispel?
- Must we have that bloody awful hymn?

739
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:19,999
It's not a hymn, darling.

740
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:22,399
- We sang it at school.
- It's from an opera.

741
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:23,519
What?

742
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:27,879
I'll give you a teeny-weeny little clue
as to which one.

743
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:31,799
We saw it tonight.

744
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,279
No.

745
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,439
It's easier in English.

746
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:40,959
What is this sorrow…?

747
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,719
Two stags, same day.

748
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,479
Totally different.

749
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:50,279
Silly sausage.

750
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:55,679
Do you know,
I really wasn't very keen on the soprano.

751
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:59,239
- Too much vibrato.
- Kiri?

752
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:01,319
No, Kiri's a mezzo.

753
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:04,679
- Marvellous.
- I'm talking about Susanna.

754
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:08,399
- Which one's she?
- The little one.

755
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:12,279
- Oh, the dwarf!
- Dreadful thick ankles.

756
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:16,839
Ah! The man dressed as the woman.

757
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:19,119
No, darling.

758
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,159
How many times…?

759
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:25,719
Cherubino is the woman who plays the boy
who dresses up as a girl.

760
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,239
Ah.

761
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:33,279
Is my neck looking a little saggy?

762
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:36,319
Can you see any lines?

763
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,159
Darling!

764
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:43,919
It… It looks absolutely fine.

765
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,799
- No cold hands!
- Sorry.

766
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:57,439
I thank God every day I have been blessed
with such... beautiful skin.

767
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:02,039
You really are a very lucky boy.

768
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:05,319
You take me for granted.

769
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:10,039
You start.

770
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:16,439
- You start.
- You start.

771
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,879
- No, you start.
- You start.

772
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:25,119
No, you bloody start.

773
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:28,679
Oh, come on.

774
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:33,319
You get on top.

775
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:36,199
No, I don't want to get on top.

776
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:48,039
Start what, anyway?

777
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,159
You're Michael Douglas.

778
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:53,759
Who?

779
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:55,879
Michael Douglas.

780
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:00,479
- Who's Michael Douglas?
- Michael...

781
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,959
I ain't Michael Douglas.

782
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:08,279
I'm a virgin.

783
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:22,399
He died with his boots on.

784
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,759
He was too pissed to take them off.

785
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:27,839
Do you want me to help you?

786
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:29,679
Oh, yeah.

787
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,759
- What will you give me, first?
- Anything.

788
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:37,599
Anything?

789
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:40,039
- I might hold you to that.
- You name it.

790
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,119
This is bloody good of you.

791
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,239
Don't mention it, old chap.

792
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:52,599
Unzip a banana...

793
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:58,359
His mum never showed him
how to undo his laces.

794
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,999
Give it... Give it a good tug.

795
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:07,719
Oh, I was gonna ease it off.

796
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,719
I tell you what, eh.

797
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:14,319
If I can't ease it off, I'll give it a good tug.

798
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,199
Oh, that weren't half nice.

799
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:29,959
Did you come?

800
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:40,439
This little piggy went to market.

801
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:44,799
This little piggy stayed at home.

802
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:46,959
This little piggy had roast beef,

803
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:48,999
and this little piggy had none.

804
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:52,239
And this little piggy was a bad little piggy,
and went...

805
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:54,959
wee! all the way home.

806
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:11,879
What's the matter?

807
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:15,679
I'm thinking.

808
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:17,839
What are you thinking about?

809
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:19,719
Something sexy?

810
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:21,559
It has got something to do with sex.

811
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,959
Well, you know me. I'm game for anything.

812
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,439
Are you going to put your cap in?

813
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:35,719
Do I have to?

814
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:37,759
What do you mean, do you have to?

815
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:43,319
Oh, I get it.

816
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:48,919
No, you don't have to. We could go to sleep.

817
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:07,879
- You think I'm being selfish, don't you?
- Yeah.

818
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,999
Well, you can think what you like.

819
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:13,119
All your family are fucked up.

820
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:15,559
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

821
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:21,159
How am I fucked up, then?

822
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,639
Go on. You might be right.

823
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:32,639
Families fuck you up. That's the truth.

824
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:35,719
My family didn’t fuck me up.

825
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:37,839
Well, you were lucky, weren't you?

826
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:42,239
Look at your brother.

827
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:44,279
Struttin' about in his uniform.

828
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,119
That's just my brother, innit.

829
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:48,279
- What about your mum, then?
- What about her?

830
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,359
Well...

831
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,479
She's catatonic, isn't she?

832
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:55,759
Your dad never says two words to her.

833
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,399
They're out of date, families.

834
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:07,879
They ain't no use any more.

835
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,559
Is that what you really think?

836
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,239
Yeah.

837
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:13,359
Two's company. You know what I mean?

838
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:31,519
I like living here. Don't you?

839
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:35,959
Yeah.

840
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:42,359
This is my place.

841
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,239
Our place.

842
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:53,359
Oh, yeah.

843
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:52,399
He's a bit big, isn't he?

844
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:54,199
He was a giant.

845
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:56,319
No, I mean his head.

846
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:00,559
He's all right.

847
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:04,359
What he done was he wrote down the truth.

848
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,599
People was being exploited.

849
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:11,399
Industrial Revolution -
they was forced off the land into the factories.

850
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:14,359
There weren't no working class before then.

851
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,479
He set down a programme for change.

852
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:20,839
He's got his whole family in there with him.

853
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:23,039
Without Marx, there'd have been nothing.

854
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:25,879
Oh, look. His grandson was only four
when he died.

855
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,999
Kids died young in them days.

856
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:30,039
I know.

857
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:31,799
Wouldn't have been no unions,

858
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:32,919
no welfare state,

859
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:35,039
no nationalised industries.

860
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:37,479
I wish I'd brought some flowers now.

861
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,639
Don't matter, does it, flowers?

862
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:42,879
- What you mean, it don't matter?
- He's dead.

863
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,239
You're going on about him.

864
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:46,359
I'm talking about his ideas.

865
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,999
I know.

866
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:07,439
"The philosophers have only interpreted
the world in various ways.

867
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:09,759
The point, however, is to change it. "

868
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,919
There you are.

869
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:30,039
Oh, look. There's the chairman of
the South African Communist Party here.

870
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:39,719
Oh, simpervivums.

871
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:43,039
I've got these in the back room at home.

872
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:46,039
They're succulents.

873
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:59,119
The thing is, change what?

874
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,399
It's a different world now, innit?

875
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:04,599
That ivy could do with a bit of a prune.

876
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:12,999
By the year 2000, there'll be 36 TV stations,
24 hours a day,

877
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:15,679
telling you what to think.

878
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:18,919
They've planted them trees
right on top of them graves.

879
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:22,159
Pissing in the wind, innit.

880
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:31,279
- You ain't interested, are you?
- Yes, I am. I care a lot.

881
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:50,519
- Wotcha, comrades.
- Hello, Suzi.

882
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:52,239
- Long time no see.
- You all right?

883
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:53,919
Yeah, been fine.

884
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:56,239
- Where you been?
- Highgate Cemetery.

885
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,359
Someone dead?

886
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:00,439
Yeah. Karl Marx.

887
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:02,959
- Oh, yeah, course!
- I thought you'd have known that.

888
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:05,119
I did know that. I just forgot.

889
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:12,279
He's a reactionary sod, my dad.

890
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:14,959
When I go home for a visit,

891
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:17,159
I'm sitting there watching telly, right,

892
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:20,519
and I look at him
and I know he wants to clout me.

893
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:22,719
- Perhaps she won't tell him, eh?
- She will.

894
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:25,399
They're like that, them two.
Always have been.

895
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:29,319
When we was kids,
she was always Daddy's golden girl.

896
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:34,359
He's a self-made man, right,
and she's a bleedin' yuppie.

897
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:36,719
He loves all that. He thinks...

898
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:39,639
They both think
the sunshines out of Thatcher's arse.

899
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:42,079
That's out of order,
grassing you up to your old man.

900
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:43,679
Yeah, but she's bitter.

901
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:47,159
If she had her way,
she'd ban abortions altogether.

902
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:54,199
Do you know what she called me
this morning? A murderer.

903
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:56,279
Why can't she have kids, then?

904
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,719
It's something to do with her hormones.

905
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:02,799
She's got to take these tablets...
cos she can't hold an egg.

906
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:05,279
- Can't she?
- And they make her fat

907
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:07,559
so she gets all emotional.

908
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,239
They've got this spare room, right,

909
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:13,319
and that's where I always stay.

910
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:16,519
So, I says to 'em,
"Why don't you let me live here

911
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:19,719
and I'll give you a bit of money
out of my dole every week?"

912
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:25,119
Then, and she says,
"That's not a spare room. That's a nursery. "

913
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:30,199
So I says, "Well, it's not a nursery, is it,
cos you ain't got a baby. "

914
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:32,239
She went up the wall.

915
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:35,919
She said, "You shouldn't have got pregnant
in the first place. "

916
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:38,159
As if I did it on purpose.

917
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:40,519
As if I put myself through all that for fun.

918
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:42,599
I wouldn’t have an abortion.

919
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:44,359
- Wouldn't you?
- Nah.

920
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:46,679
- Well, that's your choice, innit?
- Yeah.

921
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:49,519
- You ain't against them, though, are you?
- You know I ain't.

922
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:54,279
You're like my sister.
You've got a spare room.

923
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:56,759
You could have a baby.

924
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:01,319
You got anyone staying tonight?

925
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:04,079
No, the room's empty.

926
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:10,079
It's nothing to do with governments.

927
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:12,399
It's a woman's choice.

928
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:15,399
And if they find that it's an abnormal foetus,

929
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:18,359
well, again, that's a woman's choice.
It's her body.

930
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:22,519
I think, right, that once a foetus is growing,
it's alive.

931
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:27,319
Yeah, but then how do you know
when it starts to think or feel anything?

932
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:31,999
- Well, you don't, but it's still a living thing.
- So's a cabbage. You still cut it up.

933
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:36,599
What pisses me off is everyone goes on
about the unborn foetus.

934
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:39,279
No-one gives a shit
what sort of world kids are born into.

935
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:45,079
Right. If you ain't got no money,
well, scuse me for breathing, right.

936
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:51,079
I mean, we're fighting, right,
to hold onto rights we fought for years ago.

937
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:55,559
She's already crippled the welfare state.

938
01:05:55,680 --> 01:06:00,559
And now she's gonna kill it off
because the power isn't with the workers.

939
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:05,839
I wanna go to Nicaragua in October,
to help them pick the coffee beans.

940
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:09,239
- That's what we need here, see - a revolution.
- Here we go.

941
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:12,679
That'll put back the power with the people.
Where it belongs.

942
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:15,639
What do you know about revolution?
There won't be none here.

943
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:19,199
You can't say that. The situation's ripe for it.

944
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:22,319
What, with the unemployment
and poverty and that.

945
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,599
We're heading towards a totalitarian state.

946
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:28,279
But the people won't have it.
They're gonna fight.

947
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:31,999
She's taken away the basic right
of the working class.

948
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:34,519
I mean, you look at what she's doing
to the unions.

949
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:37,039
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know about unions.

950
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:39,359
You're not in a union, though, are you?

951
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:41,639
Well, we ain't got no union.

952
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:45,799
Right, that's what you've got to do -
organise yourselves -

953
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:47,479
otherwise you won't have a voice.

954
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:50,119
- Still looking for a job, then?
- There's no point.

955
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:51,839
Unless you're a skilled worker.

956
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:56,159
- What are you gonna do, then?
- Well, I might get a stall in the market.

957
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:58,599
- Like Linda.
- Oh, what - jewellery?

958
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:03,279
Yeah. But I've got to learn how to make it.
I'll have to have a soldering kit.

959
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:06,079
So you're going into business?
Small-time capitalist.

960
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:07,439
She didn’t say that.

961
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:08,679
- She did.
- She never.

962
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:12,519
She talks about revolutionary socialism,
yet she's starting a business. Think.

963
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:14,759
- You think.
- Talks a load of bollocks.

964
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:16,199
She always does.

965
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:29,159
- Are you warm enough, Suzi?
- Yeah, I'm fine, thank you.

966
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:34,559
- Still go to your meetings, then?
- Yes.

967
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:36,759
Wednesday nights.

968
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:41,719
- You should come along, Cyril.
- I'm not much of a lad for meetings.

969
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:45,999
It'd do you good to get out and do something,
instead of sitting on your arse talking about it.

970
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:48,279
So what is it you do at these meetings?

971
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:51,039
- We discuss things.
- Yeah, but what do you actually do?

972
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:53,999
- We talk about things.
- So, you talk. What good's that?

973
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:57,039
- It gets it clear in your brain.
- Oh, yeah?

974
01:07:57,160 --> 01:08:01,559
Yeah, so when you're out in the street talking
to people, you know what you're talking about.

975
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:04,039
But apart from the yabber,
what do you actually do?

976
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:08,239
- We're working towards the revolution.
- You're wasting your time, then, ain't you?

977
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:10,159
Well, what do you do?

978
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:14,359
Sit on my arse.

979
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:36,559
Don't know why you don't get yourself out.
Have some fun. I won't stop you.

980
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:40,719
I'm really dying to go out on the town.
Can't wait.

981
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:43,559
That's why I'm always going on
about having babies.

982
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:49,079
- Same thing, innit?
- What's the same?

983
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:50,559
Nah...

984
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:53,719
All a bourgeois game, innit.

985
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:58,679
Get yourself into a nice house,
couple of kids, dog...

986
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:03,519
- .. garden with a greenhouse.
- I wouldn’t say no to the green house.

987
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:12,559
- You don't know what you want.
- No, you don't know what I want, do you.

988
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:21,879
- I feel cut off.
- What, from me?

989
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,319
No, not from you.

990
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:26,319
- Tell me what you want.
- Don't tell me what to say.

991
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:28,839
I ain't telling you. I'm asking you.

992
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:38,679
I can't say. It's too obvious.

993
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:43,519
- Too complicated.
- Go on.

994
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:47,879
It'll sound stupid.

995
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:57,999
I want everyone to have enough to eat.

996
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:00,119
I told you.

997
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:04,519
- Places to live, jobs.
- Don't we all.

998
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:07,399
Then you have babies.

999
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:16,119
I ain't gonna get what I want, though, am I?

1000
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:17,679
No.

1001
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:28,879
- So, do you want to knock it on the head?
- I can't wave a magic wand.

1002
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:34,119
I'm a dead loss.

1003
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:37,519
Don't do nothing. Just sit here moaning.

1004
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:40,959
Don't know why you don't clear off.

1005
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:44,719
- I would...
- Go on, then.

1006
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:48,719
.. if I didn’t love you.

1007
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:56,439
I don't want you to go.
I just keep feeling I'm holding you back.

1008
01:10:56,560 --> 01:11:00,279
You are holding me back,
you stupid bastard.

1009
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,639
Are you thick?

1010
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:24,679
The world ain't ever gonna be perfect.

1011
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:58,279
Now, then, how's my little birthday girl?

1012
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:02,999
Cheer up - it might never happen.

1013
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:05,879
How old are you? 21?

1014
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,799
17, and never been kissed?

1015
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:11,039
Er... I said "kissed"!

1016
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:16,279
I bet you was a right little raver,
wasn't you, in your day?

1017
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:18,799
Doing the Charleston!

1018
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:20,919
Know what I mean?

1019
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,119
Here, do you fancy a drink?

1020
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:26,279
I don't go in pubs.

1021
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:28,399
Come on - don't be a pain in the arse.

1022
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:33,879
There's a couple of old geezers in my boozer
who'd cream their jeans over you.

1023
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:38,879
Get their pacemakers going at 78, you would.

1024
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:42,439
Where's Valerie?

1025
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,519
Hangover or something.

1026
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:51,039
Cor, I could do with some of that.

1027
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:04,079
Won't be a minute, my darling.
Just got to see a man about a dog.

1028
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,839
All right, my darling? How are you doing?

1029
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:37,559
You gave me a fright.

1030
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:41,199
A little surprise for you.
You like little surprises, don't you?

1031
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:44,319
- What's the time, anyway?
- Come on, give us a kiss.

1032
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:48,839
Come on!

1033
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:50,319
What's the matter?

1034
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:54,959
- I'll put the kettle on.
- Sod that. I ain't got a lot of time. I'm in a rush.

1035
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:57,079
It don't half pong in here.

1036
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:03,599
Gordon Bennett!

1037
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:06,799
- Oi, come on!
- Do you want tea or coffee?

1038
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:09,279
I don't want nothing. Come here.

1039
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:12,799
I waited till half-12 for you the other night.

1040
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:17,159
- Oh, yeah. I got a bit tied up. Sorry about that.
- What do you mean?

1041
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:21,799
Oh, some wallies from Birmingham showed up.
Come on, darling. I'm rock hard.

1042
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:25,439
- Don't be so rude.
- Look, leave it out! I am.

1043
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:29,719
Look, don't mess me about -
I've only got about ten minutes.

1044
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:32,359
- I've got somebody in the car.
- Who?

1045
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:34,239
- Don't matter.
- Who's in the car?

1046
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:38,599
Someone you don't know.
Come on, darling. Let's go to bed.

1047
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:41,639
- Get off.
- You know you want it.

1048
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:43,159
Let's just do it.

1049
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:55,519
- Who is it?
- Who's what?

1050
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:57,119
In the car.

1051
01:14:57,240 --> 01:14:59,239
My mother-in-law, if you must know.

1052
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:02,159
Liar.

1053
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:04,279
It is.

1054
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:18,199
Have you seen your kid?

1055
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:22,319
No. I ain't seen neither of them
since before Christmas.

1056
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:36,799
What are you doing?

1057
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:40,519
I've got to go.

1058
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:52,319
I'll catch up with you, right?

1059
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:07,239
Shall we go home now, then?

1060
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:16,199
Ah! Hi, Cyril.
So, you found it all right? Hi, Shirl.

1061
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:17,599
All right?

1062
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:21,039
Well, don't just stand there. Come in.

1063
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:24,599
Must be cold on that bike.

1064
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:32,679
So, you're gonna hide behind this door.

1065
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:37,679
And when she comes in, I want you to jump out
like this, and give her a surprise. All right?

1066
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:40,759
- Just like that?
- That's right, Shirley.

1067
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:44,839
- We'll frighten the life out of her.
- Cyril, just relax, please.

1068
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:47,159
- I am relaxed.
- Do you think they got lost?

1069
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:48,999
No!

1070
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,599
Oh! Is that for me?

1071
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:56,559
No, it's your mum's birthday present.

1072
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:59,519
- Crisp, Shirl?
- No, thanks.

1073
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:01,519
Cyril won't want one.

1074
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:04,559
- So, what is it, then?
- It's a shawl.

1075
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:06,679
Oh, she won't like that.

1076
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,079
What did you get her?

1077
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:12,479
Well, why should I tell you?
Have you seen our fire?

1078
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:16,079
You can turn it up or down. Look.

1079
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:18,319
It's not real.

1080
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:21,039
- Ain't it?
- Did you choose all this, then?

1081
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:22,919
Yeah. Do you like it?

1082
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,639
- Bit noisy, innit?
- I can't hear anything.

1083
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:30,839
- We're detached.
- Are you?

1084
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:36,759
This supposed to be a chess set, then?

1085
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:39,679
- Don't you play, Shirl?
- Yeah. Do you?

1086
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:42,959
- Yeah!
- Yeah?

1087
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:47,399
You've got all the bits in the wrong place.
That's a rook. That should go on the outside.

1088
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:49,359
And that should go there.

1089
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:52,039
Leave that alone, please! All right? Look.

1090
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:55,439
I like it like that. All right?

1091
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:07,799
Here he is - the jerk in the Merc.

1092
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:10,239
No, the wanker in the tanker.

1093
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:13,479
The weasel in the diesel.

1094
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:15,799
Where the bleedin' hell have you been?

1095
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:19,479
- I got tied up. Business.
- What sort of business?

1096
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:26,599
None of your business. Never mind that.
She wants to go to the khazi. She's bursting.

1097
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:30,959
- Close the door.
- Close your mouth.

1098
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:34,079
All right, Cyril? How you doing? Wotcha, Sheila.

1099
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:35,599
- Shirley.
- Want a drink?

1100
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:39,039
I've got one, thanks... Marvin.

1101
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:49,199
Mum, what are you doing in there?

1102
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:51,279
Oh, come on!

1103
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:54,439
What have you got your hat on for?
Going on your holidays?

1104
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:56,559
Don't leave that there.

1105
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:00,759
Oh, bloody hell!

1106
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:11,119
- You said you was coming for me.
- Shut up.

1107
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:14,799
Happy birthday to you,
happy birthday to you

1108
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:19,679
Happy birthday, dear Mum,
happy birthday to you

1109
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:23,759
- All right?
- Look who's here. It's Cyril. What a surprise!

1110
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:26,199
- All right, Mrs Bender?
- And he's brought Shirley.

1111
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:28,399
Now, what are you having to drink? Sherry?

1112
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:30,239
- Champagne!
- We ain't got champagne.

1113
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:32,519
- We have, actually. Six bottles.
- A cup of tea.

1114
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:34,679
- You don't want tea.
Yes, she does.

1115
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:37,039
- It's your birthday!
- Get her a cup of tea.

1116
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:40,039
We have got all the drink money can buy.
Why has she got to have tea?

1117
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:42,479
Get her a cup of tea.
- It's what she wants.

1118
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:45,079
She always spoils everything. Hello, baby.

1119
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:58,319
I'm sorry, Shirl. Over there, please. Thank you.

1120
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:00,799
Mum, I've got your tea.

1121
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:03,279
This is bloody barmy, sitting round the table.

1122
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:07,119
- Shut up.
- You'd think we was having steak and chips.

1123
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:10,079
- Don't drag her.
- I know how to handle my own mum, thank you.

1124
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:13,999
Sit down. You're the birthday girl.

1125
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:17,119
Shirl, sit down. Cyril, not there.

1126
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:21,119
- Well, where, then?
- Over there, next to Shirley.

1127
01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:23,479
- Martin, what are you doing?
- Getting pissed.

1128
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:25,919
Well, come and sit at the head of the table.

1129
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:29,639
I'll go and get the tea.

1130
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:36,199
I wouldn’t eat them -
you might get stomach-ache.

1131
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:40,039
Handy, though, a brass banana.
You never know when you'll want one of those.

1132
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:41,759
They don't grow on trees.

1133
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:44,519
Martin! The champagne!

1134
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:46,999
All right, keep your hair on.

1135
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:49,359
Shall I give her her present now?

1136
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:50,839
Yeah, go on.

1137
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:53,759
We bought you this for your birthday.

1138
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:55,959
- What is it?
- Well, open it.

1139
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:59,559
- It's a shawl, innit?
- Here we are!

1140
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:06,959
What am I supposed to do with this?

1141
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:09,599
I told you so!

1142
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:12,599
Wrap it round your shoulders.
Keep yourself warm.

1143
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:16,879
- Did you get our present, Mum?
- What?

1144
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,879
- My present.
- No.

1145
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,999
Oh, typical Harrods!

1146
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:24,119
Why don't you shut your gob?

1147
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:27,919
- Shall I get rid of that?
- There we are, blossom.

1148
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:31,719
- I don't want any.
- Go on. It's the best money can buy. Cyril?

1149
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:34,039
- No, I've got a beer. I'll drink that.
- So will I.

1150
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:35,959
You want a beer? 'Ere, get their beers.

1151
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:39,879
- We're not having beer. We've got champagne.
- If they want beer, they shall have it.

1152
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:43,319
- Martin, what are you playing at?
- Get out of it.

1153
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:49,719
Here we are. Dos cervezas, por favor.

1154
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:52,719
Now, my darling,
you know class when you see it, don't you?

1155
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:54,919
- I don't want any.
- Come on, you only live once.

1156
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:57,839
- What about me?
- All right, all right!

1157
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:00,919
Mum, pick up your glass. Pick it up!

1158
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:04,559
- Don't talk to her like that.
- Shirl, this is a family occasion. All right?

1159
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:09,039
I would like to propose a toast to Mum's birthday,
cos it could be her last.

1160
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:54,519
What you've got to learn is,
you've got to speculate to accumulate.

1161
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:58,519
- Accumulate what?
- Money. What's your weekly turnover?

1162
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:03,319
- You mean what the boss makes?
- No, no, what you make.

1163
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:07,279
- Mind your own business.
- Well, you can trust me. Who am I gonna tell?

1164
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:08,919
I earn enough.

1165
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:11,759
- I bet you don't.
- You all right, Mrs Bender?

1166
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:15,719
- I'm still alive.
- And kicking.

1167
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:20,759
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do, Cyril. I'm gonna
give you a piece of professional advice.

1168
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:23,159
Go on.

1169
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:33,319
Your best bet is
to form yourself a little company.

1170
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:34,919
What for?

1171
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:39,599
Well, you let the other wallies do the dirty work,
and you sit in Happy Valley collecting the dosh.

1172
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:42,519
I wouldn’t do that, on principle.

1173
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:46,399
How do you mean?

1174
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:49,159
No, look, I'm being serious.
Business is booming.

1175
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:52,279
They all need delivery boys.
What are you waiting for?

1176
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:55,119
It ain't everybody's purpose in life
to accumulate money.

1177
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:58,719
Ah, out of order, Cyril.
I'll tell you something free of charge -

1178
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:00,839
every man has his price.

1179
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:04,519
- We ain't all like you.
- I know you ain't all like me. Very few are.

1180
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:08,519
He's in a dead-end job. What are you
gonna be doing when you're 45, 50?

1181
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:13,919
You won't want to be on the street, all weathers,
on a moped all day. You've got to think ahead.

1182
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:16,919
- I'll manage.
- Where do you think this lot come from?

1183
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:19,079
Off the back of a lorry.

1184
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:21,519
You ain't as stupid as you look.

1185
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:24,039
Shame I can't say the same about you, innit?

1186
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:30,519
You've got a lot to learn, Cyril.

1187
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:54,839
How long have you and Cyril
been going together?

1188
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:57,399
- About ten years.
- Gonna get married?

1189
01:25:57,520 --> 01:25:59,319
Why? What's it to you?

1190
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:02,799
If you get married,
we'll be related, won't we?

1191
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:08,319
But in the meantime...

1192
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:20,239
Have you ever done any modelling?

1193
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:22,359
No, but I've done a bit of yodelling.

1194
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:30,119
She taught me to yodel, yodel-ay-ee-hee...

1195
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:32,239
I see you ain't done none.

1196
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:41,199
Have you and Cyril got one of these -
what do you call it? -

1197
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:43,799
open relationships, sort of thing?

1198
01:26:44,840 --> 01:26:47,119
- Nip off and do other things?
Like what?

1199
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:49,159
- Bit of this, bit of that.
- Bit of the other?

1200
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:52,519
- You got it.
- Why? Is that what you do, then?

1201
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:55,399
Not me.
I'm a happily married man.

1202
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:59,279
Oh, yeah.
You've got a great big car, ain't you?

1203
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:05,879
- Are you gonna come out in the garden?
- No.

1204
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:09,519
- Give me some of your professional advice?
- Do me a favour.

1205
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:13,479
Actually, there's one particular plant
I'd like you to have a look at.

1206
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:14,999
Yeah, I'll bet there is.

1207
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:18,159
- Down the bottom end, away from the house.
- Yeah?

1208
01:27:18,280 --> 01:27:21,079
Hang on - I'll go
and get my garden shears out.

1209
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:28,519
Come on - it's nice and dark now.

1210
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:36,279
I hope she ain't too cold.

1211
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:38,479
What, like you?

1212
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:44,679
Wanker.

1213
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:49,919
Ah, hello, Cyril.
Have you got everything you want?

1214
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:52,159
Yeah, I have, as it happens.

1215
01:27:56,960 --> 01:28:00,199
What the fuck are you doing?
I'm just sitting down.

1216
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:03,679
- Why are you sitting on the floor?
- I'm getting the cake ready.

1217
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:05,799
Get the cake ready, then.

1218
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:11,679
- Have you drunk all that champagne?
- No!

1219
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:14,159
- Give me some.
- Don't drink all that!

1220
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:17,399
- Listen, get in there.
- Don't you shout at me.

1221
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:23,839
Happy birthday to you,
happy birthday to you

1222
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:30,559
Happy birthday, dear Mum,
happy birthday to you

1223
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:32,959
There. Are you gonna blow the candle out?

1224
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:36,199
Come on - blow!

1225
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:38,959
Mum, blow the candle out.

1226
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:43,239
- Want me to do it for you?
- Cyril, keep your nose out of this, please!

1227
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:46,119
Come on! One, two, three...

1228
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:49,959
- Hurray!
Happy birthday, my darling.

1229
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:52,439
Make a wish.
I know what I'd wish.

1230
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:54,679
- We all know that, Martin.
- You don't.

1231
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:57,639
- Well, we can imagine, can't we?
- No, you can't.

1232
01:28:57,760 --> 01:29:00,999
Now, are you gonna have
some of this delicious cake, Mum?

1233
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:02,999
- I can't eat that.
- Course you are!

1234
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:06,519
- If she don't want none...
- Cyril, she's gonna have some cake.

1235
01:29:06,640 --> 01:29:10,959
Here you are, Mum. Open wide.
Down the hatch. Open.

1236
01:29:11,080 --> 01:29:14,239
Oh, look, leave her alone!

1237
01:29:14,360 --> 01:29:17,319
If she don't want it, she ain't gonna have any.
It's her birthday.

1238
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:21,239
.. And she's having some cake,
or else her wish goes down the drain.

1239
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:23,679
What are you talking about?

1240
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:25,519
Let her eat it in her own time.

1241
01:29:25,640 --> 01:29:28,119
Listen, will you not shout in front of Mum?

1242
01:29:28,240 --> 01:29:33,079
It's her birthday, and you stick a forkful
of cake in her face. What's wrong with you?

1243
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:35,959
You're having a breakdown.

1244
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:40,999
I'm having a breakdown? You've been
having a breakdown for the last 20 years!

1245
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:44,839
No, it's all them drugs, isn't it?
Cos you're a drug addict.

1246
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:48,199
- You wouldn't know, Shirley. You're the same.
- You're always drunk.

1247
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:50,239
Look at yourself! Talking about me!

1248
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:52,959
Go upstairs,
look in the mirror and look at yourself.

1249
01:29:53,080 --> 01:29:55,519
Don't tell me what to do in my own house.

1250
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:59,559
You're a disgrace.
- Who's a disgrace? Look at you!

1251
01:29:59,680 --> 01:30:02,679
You fill the house with expensive tat.

1252
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:06,199
It ain't her birthday party.
It's got nothing to do with her. It's for you.

1253
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:10,719
Let's face it, you are jealous.
You want to put everybody down, Cyril.

1254
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:13,039
You even stopped Mum having her own house.

1255
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:17,319
I stopped Mum having her own house?
You wanted her to buy that house,

1256
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:21,239
just so you could sell it off later on,
when she's gone, and make a huge profit.

1257
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:54,559
You don't half look nice.

1258
01:30:56,080 --> 01:30:58,079
Thanks.

1259
01:30:58,200 --> 01:31:00,199
So do you.

1260
01:31:03,640 --> 01:31:06,799
Val? Come on out.

1261
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:10,399
Hello, Delta? Is that Davey?

1262
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:13,639
It's Cyril from Greased Lightning.

1263
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:15,759
Come on!
- How's it going?

1264
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:19,359
No, no, I don't want no more at the moment.

1265
01:31:19,480 --> 01:31:21,639
No, no, it was great.

1266
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:24,479
I need a cab a bit sharpish.

1267
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:28,719
Yeah, I'll hold on.

1268
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:39,199
Come on, then, Mrs Bender.
Put your coat on.

1269
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:42,799
- Where am I going?
- You're going home.

1270
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:46,679
- Who's taking me?
- I hope he ain't ringing Hong Kong.

1271
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:49,479
We're phoning for a taxi for Mrs Bender.

1272
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:51,919
Who? Oh.

1273
01:31:52,040 --> 01:31:54,879
- I ain't going in no taxi on my own.
- I'll come with you, then.

1274
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:58,519
'Ere, you don't wanna go home yet, darling.
You've only just got here.

1275
01:31:58,640 --> 01:32:00,759
- Who's paying for it?
- We're paying.

1276
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:04,279
- I ain't paying for it.
- No, I ain't paying for it, neither.

1277
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:05,759
Sit down, then.

1278
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:08,119
'Ere, Val,
get your arse down here!

1279
01:32:08,240 --> 01:32:10,039
- 20 minutes.
- I'll go back with her.

1280
01:32:10,160 --> 01:32:12,559
Is that OK? You all right for dosh?

1281
01:32:12,680 --> 01:32:13,879
No.

1282
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:17,839
- Four-eyed fucking moron!
- You talking to me?

1283
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:22,079
Oh, yeah! No, not you, Cyril.
Your bleedin' sister.

1284
01:32:22,200 --> 01:32:23,639
Fair enough.

1285
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:27,399
How much is a cab to King's Cross?

1286
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:30,199
Well, you've got to be talking 15.

1287
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:36,199
- See you later.
- Last of the big spenders, eh, Cyril?

1288
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:38,279
Drive safely.

1289
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:43,399
Cyril, would you like a drop of whisky?
I've got a bottle of Chivas Regal.

1290
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:52,919
'Ere, Cyril, I'll tell you something.

1291
01:32:53,960 --> 01:32:56,959
You're my fucking brother-in-law!

1292
01:33:15,880 --> 01:33:19,159
'Ere, darlin', wanna go to the pub?

1293
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:31,279
Women! All the bleedin' same.
Fucking losers.

1294
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:05,679
Won't be long.

1295
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:11,079
- I don't know the way.
- Don't you?

1296
01:34:13,680 --> 01:34:16,799
You've got a hot-water bottle at your house,
ain't you?

1297
01:34:20,640 --> 01:34:22,639
What do I want to go home for?

1298
01:34:27,080 --> 01:34:30,279
I don't want nothing off her.
Who does she think she is?

1299
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:32,279
- Who?
- Freda.

1300
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:34,399
Who's Freda?

1301
01:34:44,720 --> 01:34:46,919
Brown-Eyed Handsome Man

1302
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:03,879
Quick. Your mum wants to go to the toilet.

1303
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:09,599
- What's happened?
- She didn’t want to go home. She's all right.

1304
01:35:09,720 --> 01:35:13,399
- Mind your hand. You'll get a prick.
- That's all she's short of!

1305
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:17,519
Now, give us your bag. That's it. In you go.

1306
01:35:20,120 --> 01:35:22,119
All right?

1307
01:35:24,200 --> 01:35:27,399
Oh, that's a nice smell. I'm starving.

1308
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:29,599
Oh, I ain't half glad to see you.

1309
01:35:29,720 --> 01:35:32,199
- What's going on?
- She went a bit vague.

1310
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:34,839
- What did you bring her back here for?
- She was upset.

1311
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:38,199
- So?
- She's your mum.

1312
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:45,759
I don't want her here.

1313
01:35:49,080 --> 01:35:51,079
She keeps losing herself.

1314
01:35:53,080 --> 01:35:55,239
Who's Freda?

1315
01:35:55,360 --> 01:35:57,799
- Freda?
- Yeah, she was talking about her.

1316
01:35:57,920 --> 01:35:59,919
That's my Auntie Freda, her sister.

1317
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:05,639
- How long have them pies been in?
- Be ready in a minute. Here, hurry up.

1318
01:36:26,120 --> 01:36:28,119
Don't forget to drink your tea.

1319
01:36:36,520 --> 01:36:39,239
You can have a cup of tea, if you want.

1320
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:41,879
Oh, thanks!

1321
01:36:47,160 --> 01:36:48,519
Is this the bed room?

1322
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:51,079
No, it's the front room, innit?

1323
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:53,039
We sleep in here cos it's warmer.

1324
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:57,159
I've been here.

1325
01:36:57,280 --> 01:36:58,959
No, you ain't.

1326
01:36:59,080 --> 01:37:00,399
I have.

1327
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:02,119
No, this is our house.

1328
01:37:09,480 --> 01:37:13,519
- Man-mad, she was.
Who was man-mad?

1329
01:37:14,720 --> 01:37:16,399
I never took him away from her.

1330
01:37:18,240 --> 01:37:20,039
What's the matter?

1331
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:27,839
- Did Valerie give me a present?
- No, she never.

1332
01:37:34,840 --> 01:37:37,319
She said we was getting off
at the Nag's Head.

1333
01:37:40,160 --> 01:37:42,159
How was I supposed to see?

1334
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:47,399
I caught my shoe in the tram lines.

1335
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:53,839
What did she have to smack my legs for?

1336
01:37:53,960 --> 01:37:55,959
She never laid a finger on Freda.

1337
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:07,079
They both stood there laughing at me,
in front of all them people.

1338
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,999
It weren't my fault.

1339
01:38:14,240 --> 01:38:17,199
Why should I always have to wear
Freda's hand-me-downs?

1340
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:21,919
All right for Rene -
she always had a new frock.

1341
01:38:22,040 --> 01:38:23,279
It's all right.

1342
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:27,999
I told her: I've never been drunk in my life.

1343
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:34,999
I want to go to bed.

1344
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:40,079
- I'd better get her a cab.
- Yeah, I think so. 'Ere, where are you going?

1345
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:43,799
I'm gonna phone 'em up.

1346
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:51,599
She's spark out.

1347
01:38:58,680 --> 01:39:00,559
Who's that?

1348
01:39:01,480 --> 01:39:03,239
It's a skeleton. It's no-one.

1349
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:06,079
It's a poster
for nuclear disarmament.

1350
01:39:09,320 --> 01:39:11,399
I suppose we'd better sleep
in the other room.

1351
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:13,879
There's no way
I'm sleeping in the other room.

1352
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,839
- Ain't there?
- No.

1353
01:39:15,960 --> 01:39:17,759
Oh, all right.

1354
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:25,319
I'll be 70 in 2026, if we're all still here.

1355
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:30,199
That'll be the centenary of the General Strike.

1356
01:39:31,240 --> 01:39:33,239
What?

1357
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:37,839
I'll be 35 in June.

1358
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:43,359
If we have a kid this year,
when you're 70, he'll be 35.

1359
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:47,439
- Oh, leave it out.
- Or she.

1360
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:53,559
- Father Christmas.
- Ho, ho, ho.

1361
01:39:57,520 --> 01:40:00,519
What would you rather have -
a boy or a girl?

1362
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:03,559
I don't mind, really. One of each.

1363
01:40:04,520 --> 01:40:06,439
What would you rather have?

1364
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:09,559
I'd rather have a rusty spike
shoved up my arse.

1365
01:40:21,720 --> 01:40:24,719
What are we gonna do about your mum?

1366
01:40:24,840 --> 01:40:29,559
What was it she said?
She never took him away from her?

1367
01:40:29,680 --> 01:40:31,519
From who?

1368
01:40:31,640 --> 01:40:33,199
- From Freda.
- No.

1369
01:40:33,320 --> 01:40:37,799
- Yeah, she had a thing about her.
- No. It'll be my Auntie Rene.

1370
01:40:42,440 --> 01:40:44,439
She must have meant my dad.

1371
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:51,879
I'll have to go round there more often.

1372
01:40:52,720 --> 01:40:56,079
She needs more than that.
She needs looking after.

1373
01:40:57,280 --> 01:40:59,119
I know.

1374
01:41:03,720 --> 01:41:05,639
Are you scared of getting old?

1375
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:07,759
A bit. Are you?

1376
01:41:09,360 --> 01:41:11,159
Dunno.

1377
01:41:13,440 --> 01:41:16,719
- I'm scared of looking back.
- What do you mean?

1378
01:41:18,440 --> 01:41:23,159
From 25 to 35-
best years of your life, aren't they?

1379
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:25,679
- And what about after that?
- Down hill.

1380
01:41:25,800 --> 01:41:27,959
What, all the way?

1381
01:41:32,200 --> 01:41:34,199
I'm scared of getting bitter.

1382
01:41:36,720 --> 01:41:38,719
You won't get bitter.

1383
01:41:46,040 --> 01:41:48,039
I ain't got my cap in.

1384
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:55,279
What is it?

1385
01:41:55,400 --> 01:41:57,399
Have a look.

1386
01:42:01,120 --> 01:42:04,199
- Did you nick it?
- No, it followed me home.

1387
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:17,119
- You're gonna be late for work.
- Yeah. Can't be helped, though, can it?

1388
01:42:17,240 --> 01:42:19,319
I'll be all right for a bit.

1389
01:42:19,440 --> 01:42:22,039
'Ere. I haven't had my pills.

1390
01:42:22,160 --> 01:42:25,199
- Well, how did you sleep?
- Like a baby.

1391
01:42:25,320 --> 01:42:28,279
Well, you can do without your pills,
then, can't you?

1392
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:32,279
- I'll have to go home soon.
- Yeah, you're a dirty stop-out!

1393
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:35,399
Must have a bath.

1394
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:37,439
Are you warmer now?

1395
01:42:37,560 --> 01:42:39,559
Yeah.

1396
01:42:40,520 --> 01:42:42,319
This is nice.

1397
01:42:46,600 --> 01:42:48,599
All right?

1398
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,879
- 'Ere, where's this?
- On the roof, innit?

1399
01:42:55,880 --> 01:42:57,679
Can you manage?

1400
01:42:58,680 --> 01:43:00,559
Come on.

1401
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:03,319
Want to have a rest?

1402
01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:06,399
Here, sit down here.

1403
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:16,439
- Will we get told off?
- Don't you worry about a thing.

1404
01:43:18,360 --> 01:43:21,479
Hey, Cyril, bring her over here.

1405
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:27,759
Come on.

1406
01:43:30,680 --> 01:43:32,479
Where are we going?

1407
01:43:33,320 --> 01:43:35,319
There's King's Cross. Look.

1408
01:43:39,080 --> 01:43:41,479
And there's St Pancras.

1409
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:44,359
- Station?
- Yeah.

1410
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:52,399
- What's this?
- It's my garden, innit?

1411
01:43:52,520 --> 01:43:55,879
Through there, look - St Paul's Cathedral.

1412
01:43:56,920 --> 01:43:59,399
- Like a tit, innit?
- Shut up!

1413
01:43:59,520 --> 01:44:01,519
Come and have a look at the trains.

1414
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:06,919
- Don't go too close.
- It's all right.

1415
01:44:10,200 --> 01:44:12,719
- It's where Dad used to work, innit?
- I know.

1416
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:15,759
- I know you know.
- Wanna go on a train?

1417
01:44:15,880 --> 01:44:18,079
- Not today.
- No, when it's warmer.

1418
01:44:19,040 --> 01:44:22,199
- Where would you like to go?
- I've been to Margate.

1419
01:44:22,320 --> 01:44:25,879
You don't wanna go there.
We'll take you somewhere nice. Ramsgate.

1420
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:27,719
- Aldgate.
- Harrogate.

1421
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:29,159
- Cow and Gate.
- Watergate.

1422
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:32,959
Do you want to sit down?

1423
01:44:35,640 --> 01:44:38,839
Over there - look. That's where you live.

1424
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:40,839
Yeah, behind the gasworks.

1425
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:49,479
- It's the top of the world.

1426
01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:51,359
I said it's the top of the world.
