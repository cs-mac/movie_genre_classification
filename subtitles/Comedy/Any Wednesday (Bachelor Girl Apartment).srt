00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:36,469
<i>On November 1, 1959, the population</i>
<i>of New York City was 8,042, 783.</i>

2
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,591
<i>If you laid them all end to end, figuring</i>
<i>an average height of 5 feet 6.5 inches...</i>

3
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,599
<i>...they would reach from Times Square</i>
<i>to the outskirts of Karachi, Pakistan.</i>

4
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,952
<i>I know facts like this because I work for</i>
<i>an insurance company, Consolidated Life.</i>

5
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,514
<i>We're one of the top five companies</i>
<i>in the country.</i>

6
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,269
<i>Our home office has 31,259 employees...</i>

7
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,552
<i>...which is more than the entire population</i>
<i>of, uh... Natchez, Mississippi.</i>

8
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,558
<i>I work on the 19th floor.</i>
<i>Ordinary Policy Department...</i>

9
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,639
<i>...Premium Accounting Division,</i>
<i>Section W, desk number 861.</i>

10
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,597
<i>My name is CC Baxter: C for Calvin, C for</i>
<i>Clifford. But most people call me Bud.</i>

11
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,669
<i>I've worked here three years, ten months,</i>
<i>and my take-home pay is $94. 70 a week.</i>

12
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,552
<i>The hours in our department</i>
<i>are 8.50 to 5.20.</i>

13
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:40,075
<i>They're staggered by floor so 16 elevators</i>
<i>can handle the 31,259 employees...</i>

14
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,555
<i>...without a serious traffic jam.</i>

15
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,629
<i>As for myself, I very often stay on at the</i>
<i>office and work for an extra hour or two...</i>

16
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,751
<i>...especially when the weather is bad.</i>

17
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,316
<i>It's not that I'm overly ambitious.</i>
<i>It's just a way of killing time...</i>

18
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,034
<i>...until it's all right for me to go home.</i>

19
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,470
<i>You see, I have this little problem</i>
<i>with my apartment.</i>

20
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,117
<i>I live in the West 60s,</i>
<i>just half a block from Central Park.</i>

21
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,277
<i>My rent is $85 a month.</i>
<i>It used to be $80 until last July...</i>

22
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,154
<i>...when Mrs. Lieberman, the landlady,</i>
<i>put in a second-hand air conditioner.</i>

23
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,718
<i>It's a real nice apartment. Nothing fancy,</i>
<i>but kind of cozy. Just right for a bachelor.</i>

24
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,150
<i>The only problem is</i>
<i>I can't always get in when I want to.</i>

25
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,557
Cut it out, Sylvia.
We've gotta get out of here.

26
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,592
What's the panic?
I'm gonna have another martini.

27
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,790
Please, Sylvia. It's a quarter of nine.

28
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,117
First you can't wait to get me here
and then it's rush, rush, rush.

29
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,312
- Makes a person feel cheap.
- Sweetie, it's not that.

30
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,113
But I promised the guy
I'd be outta here by eight.

31
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:56,633
- What guy? Whose apartment is this?
- Some schnook that works in the office.

32
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,869
- Good evening, Mr. Baxter.
- Mrs. Lieberman.

33
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,755
Some weather we're having. Must be from
all that <i>meshugaas</i> at Cape Canaveral.

34
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,556
- You're locked out of your apartment?
- No, no. Just waiting for a friend.

35
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,311
- Good night, Mrs. Lieberman.
- Good night, Mr. Baxter.

36
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,080
- Where do you live?
- I told you. With my mother.

37
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,272
- Where does <i>she</i> live?
- 179th Street, in the Bronx.

38
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:54,190
- All right. I'll take you to the subway.
- Like hell you will! You'll buy me a cab.

39
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,074
- Why do all you dames live in the Bronx?
- You bring other girls up here?

40
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,953
Certainly not. I'm a happily married man.

41
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,672
- Hello there, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
- Something's the matter?

42
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,713
Uh, no. I... seem to have
dropped my key. Ah, here it is.

43
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,229
Such a racket I heard in your place.

44
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,396
Maybe you had burglars?

45
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,798
Don't worry about that. There's nothing in
here anybody'd wanna steal. Good night.

46
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,557
Sorry to bother you, Buddy-boy,
but the little lady forgot her galoshes.

47
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,036
Mr. Kirkeby, you were supposed
to be outta here by eight.

48
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,551
I know, but those things don't always
run on schedule like a Greyhound bus.

49
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,240
I don't mind in the summer,
but on a rainy night...

50
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,920
- I haven't had any dinner yet.
- Sure, sure.

51
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,996
Oh!

52
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,397
I put in a good word for you
with Sheldrake in Personnel.

53
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,033
- Mr. Sheldrake?
- That's right.

54
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,948
We discussed manpower promotionwise.
I told him you're a bright boy.

55
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,039
They're always on the lookout for
young executives. You're on your way up.

56
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,869
- And you're also out of liquor.
- Mr. Eichelberger, Mortgage and Loans...

57
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,278
...last night he had a Halloween party.
- Lay in some vodka and vermouth for me.

58
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,518
- You still owe me for the last two bottles.
- I'll pay you on Friday.

59
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:22,668
Oh, and whatever happened to those little
cheese crackers you used to have?

60
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,756
Cheese crackers?

61
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,516
Cheers.

62
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,668
- Good evening, Baxter.
- Hi, Doc. Had a late call?

63
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:28,271
Yeah. Some clown at Schrafft's ate
a club sandwich - including the toothpick.

64
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,800
- Well, good night, Doc.
- Say, Baxter.

65
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:36,595
The way you're beltin' that stuff,
you must have cast-iron kidneys.

66
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:40,759
That's not me. Just once in a while
I have a few people in for a drink.

67
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,838
As a matter of fact, you must be
an iron man all around.

68
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,111
From what I hear through the walls,
you're at it every night.

69
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,518
- I'm sorry if it gets noisy.
- And sometimes there's a double-header.

70
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,516
- <i>A nebbish</i> like you.
- Yeah. Well, I'll see you, Doc.

71
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:59,235
You know, I'm doing some research
at the Columbia Medical Center.

72
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,555
- Could you do us a favor?
- Me?

73
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,355
When you make out your will -
and the way you're going, you should -

74
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:09,393
would you mind leaving
your body to the university?

75
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:13,638
My body? I'm afraid you guys'd
be disappointed. Good night, Doc.

76
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,916
Slow down, kid.

77
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,836
Oh, for heaven...

78
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,437
<i>From the world's greatest library</i>

<i>Friends, do you have wobbly dentures?</i>

89
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,758
- Hello.
- Hiya, Buddy-boy.

90
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:41,555
I'm in this bar on 61st Street
and I figured I'd give you a little buzz.

91
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,114
That's very nice of you but... who is this?

92
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,629
Dobisch. Joe Dobisch, in Administration.

93
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:50,389
- Oh, yeah. I didn't recognize your voice.
- That's OK, Buddy-boy.

94
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:54,877
Like I was saying, I'm in this joint
on 61st and I think I got lucky.

95
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,874
I'm sorry, Mr. Dobisch. I like to help
you fellas out, but it's sort of late.

96
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,152
- Why don't we make it some other time?
- Listen, kid. I can't pass this up.

97
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,874
She looks like Marilyn Monroe.

98
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,073
I'm already in bed. And I took a sleeping
pill. So I'm afraid the answer is no.

99
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,559
We're doing the monthly efficiency rating.
I'm putting you in the top ten.

100
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,830
You don't wanna
louse yourself up, do you?

101
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:22,511
No. But how can I be efficient in the
office if I don't get enough sleep at night?

102
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:26,599
It's only eleven, and I just
want the place for 45 minutes.

103
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,558
I'm getting lonely.
Who are you talking to, anyway?

104
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,514
- My mother.
- Oh, that's sweet. That's real sweet.

105
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,678
Ooh!

106
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,719
Make it 30 minutes.
What do you say, Bud, huh?

107
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,477
I'm all out of liquor,
there's no clean glasses...

108
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,115
- There's no cheese crackers. No nothin'.
- Let me worry about that.

109
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,959
Just leave the key under the mat
and clear out.

110
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,036
Yes, Mr. Dobisch.

111
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,474
Anything you say, Mr. Dobisch!

112
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:01,875
No trouble at all, Mr. Dobisch!
Be my guest!

113
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,553
We never close at Buddy-boy's.

114
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,116
"Looks like Marilyn Monroe"!

115
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,598
- This the place?
- Yeah.

116
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,597
- How much?
- 70 cents.

117
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,676
Get the money, will you?

118
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,276
Watch those stingers!

119
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,556
- Give him a buck.
- Thanks, lady.

120
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,356
Put it back, honey!

121
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,117
Attagirl.

122
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,277
- Are you sure this is a good idea?
- Can't think of a better one.

123
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,595
Barging in on your mother so late at night.

124
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:24,157
Don't worry about the old lady. One
squawk from her and she's out of a job.

125
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,556
Get the key, will you?

126
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,395
Not there! Under the mat.

127
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,114
- Under the mat?
- Yeah. Come on.

128
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,195
Open up. We haven't got all night.

129
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,836
- This is your mother's apartment?
- That's right.

130
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,429
Mildred! He's at it again!

131
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,869
- Morning, Mr. Kirkeby.
- How are you, Baxter?

132
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,754
- They keeping you busy these days?
- Yes, sir. They are indeed.

133
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,395
Good morning, Mr. Kessel, Miss Robinson,
Mr. Williams, Miss Livingston.

134
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,239
Good morning, Mr. McKellway,
Mrs. Schubert, Mr. Davis.

135
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,954
Good morning, Mr. Kirkeby.
Good morning, Mr. Baxter.

136
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,799
- Morning, Miss Kubelik.
- That's all. Take it away.

137
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,275
Watch the door, please. Blasting off.

138
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,916
- What did you do to your hair?
- It made me nervous so I chopped it off.

139
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,191
- Big mistake, huh?
- No. I sort of like it.

140
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,914
- You got a lulu.
- Yeah. Better not get too close.

141
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,871
- I never catch colds.
- Really?

142
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,719
I was reading some sickness
and accident claims figures.

143
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:43,277
The average New Yorker aged between
20 and 50 has two and a half colds a year.

144
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,755
- That makes me feel just terrible.
- Why?

145
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,953
If I have no colds a year, some poor slob
must have five colds a year.

146
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,516
- Yeah. It's me.
- You shoulda stayed in bed this morning.

147
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,995
I shoulda stayed in bed last night.

148
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,239
19!

149
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,998
Watch your step.

150
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,588
- And watch your hands, Mr. Kirkeby!
- Pardon?

151
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,076
One of these days I'm gonna
shut these doors on you and...

152
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,912
20 next!

153
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:17,189
That Kubelik. Boy, would I like
to get <i>her</i> on a slow elevator to China!

154
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,756
- She's the best operator in the building.
- I'm pretty good myself.

155
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,838
- But she won't give me a date.
- Maybe it's your approach.

156
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,589
A lot of guys around here have tried
all kinds of approaches. No dice.

157
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,713
- What's she trying to prove?
- She could just be a nice respectable girl.

158
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,229
Listen to him! Little Lord Fauntleroy.

159
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:02,354
Hello. Mr. Dobisch?
This is Baxter on the 19th floor.

160
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,152
Oh, Buddy-boy!

161
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:09,035
I was just about to call you. I'm sorry
about that mess on the living room wall.

162
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:13,153
My friend kept insisting Picasso was
a bum, so she started to do that mural.

163
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,635
It's not Picasso I'm calling about.

164
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:20,231
It's the key to my apartment.
You're supposed to leave it under the mat.

165
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,398
But I did. I distinctly
remember putting it there.

166
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,478
Oh, I found the key all right.
Only it's the wrong key!

167
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,597
It is? No wonder I couldn't get into
the executive washroom this morning.

168
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,075
And I couldn't get into my apartment!

169
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,988
So at 4 AM I gotta wake up the landlady
and give her a whole song and dance.

170
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,237
That's a shame.
I'll send the key right down.

171
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,237
And about your promotion.

172
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,432
I'll send that efficiency report
to Mr. Sheldrake in Personnel.

173
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,915
You may hear from him
before the day's over.

174
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,996
Thank you, Mr. Dobisch.

175
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,791
From Mr. Dobisch.

176
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,876
Wait.

177
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,076
For Mr. Dobisch.

178
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,476
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

179
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,352
Vanderhof. Public Relations.

180
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,436
Oh, yes, Baxter. Just a minute.

181
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,711
All right, Miss Finch.
Type up what we got so far.

182
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,435
Look, I've got you down for tonight...

183
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,757
...but I'll be using the place myself,
so I'll have to cancel.

184
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,633
But it's her birthday.
I already ordered the cake.

185
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:19,709
But I am sick. I got a terrible cold and a
fever. I got to go to bed right after work.

186
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,435
If you got a cold, you go to a Turkish bath.
Spend the night. Sweat it out.

187
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:27,553
That's how you get pneumonia. If I got
pneumonia, I'd be in bed for a month.

188
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:31,912
OK. You made your point. We'll just
have to do it next Wednesday night.

189
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:37,398
- It's the only night I can get away.
- Wednesday, Wednesday... Wednesday.

190
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,155
I got somebody penciled in.

191
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,033
Let me see what I can do.
I'll get back to you.

192
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,919
- Mr. Eichelberger.
- Oh, yes, Baxter. What's your problem?

193
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:04,595
Wednesday is out? Oh, that throws
a little monkey wrench into my agenda.

194
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,871
Thursday? No,
I'm all tied up on Thursday.

195
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,317
Let's schedule that, uh...
meeting for Friday.

196
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,396
Friday.

197
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,919
Let me see what I can do.
I'll get back to you.

198
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:28,070
Premiumwise and billingwise, we are 18
per cent ahead of last year Octoberwise.

199
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,638
Hello? Yeah, Baxter. What's up?

200
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,877
Instead of Friday, could you
possibly switch to Thursday?

201
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,673
You'd be doing me a great favor.

202
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,435
Let me check. I'll get back to you.

203
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,554
Consolidated Life. I'll connect you.

204
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,557
Sylvia, it's for you.

205
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,398
Yeah?

206
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,112
Oh, hello.

207
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,437
Sure I got home all right.
You owe me 45 cents.

208
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:59,109
Look, Sylvia. Instead of Friday,
could we make it Thursday night?

209
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:04,269
Thursday?! Well, that's
<i>The Untouchables</i> with Bob Stack!

210
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,556
Bob who?

211
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,549
All right, so we'll watch it
at the apartment. Big deal!

212
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,074
Hello, Baxter? It's OK for Thursday.

213
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,676
Thank you, Mr. Kirkeby.

214
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,308
Mr. Eichelberger, it's OK for Friday.

215
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,273
Mr. Vanderhof? OK for Wednesday.

216
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,591
All right. I'll tell him.

217
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:57,395
Hey, Baxter, that was Personnel.
Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.

218
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:02,275
She's been trying to reach you for the last
20 minutes. They want you upstairs.

219
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,796
- Are you getting promoted? Or fired?
- Would you care to make a small wager?

220
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:11,959
- I've been here twice as long as you but...
- Let's say a dollar?

221
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,593
It's a bet!

222
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,430
- Going up?
- Oh! Excuse me.

223
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:34,396
27, please. Drive carefully. You're carrying
precious cargo. I mean manpowerwise.

224
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,949
27.

225
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,868
You may not realize it, but I am
in the top ten, efficiencywise...

226
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,673
...and this may be the day promotionwise.

227
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,360
You're beginning to sound
like Mr. Kirkeby already.

228
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,359
- Why not, as they're kicking me upstairs?
- Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.

229
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,029
You know, you're the only one
who takes his hat off in the elevator.

230
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,355
Something happens to men in elevators.

231
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,358
It's the change of altitude.
The blood rushes to their head.

232
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,552
- I could tell you stories...
- I'd love to hear 'em.

233
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,148
We could have lunch
in the cafeteria sometime.

234
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,157
Or some evening, after work?

235
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,350
- 27.
- Oh.

236
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,040
- I hope everything goes all right.
- I hope so.

237
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,799
They <i>would</i> call me today,
what with my cold.

238
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,275
- How do I look?
- Fine. Wait.

239
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,633
Thank you.

240
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:23,390
I noticed, when you were still on the
local elevator, you always wore a flower.

241
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,909
Good luck. And wipe your nose.

242
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,310
CC Baxter, Ordinary Premium Accounting.
Mr. Sheldrake called me.

243
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:47,113
I called you. That is,
I tried to for 20 minutes.

244
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,196
- I'm sorry.
- Go on in.

245
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,953
- Baxter?
- Yes, sir.

246
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,036
Come in, come in.

247
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,793
I was sort of wondering
what you looked like, Baxter.

248
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,309
- Sit down.
- Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.

249
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,399
Been hearing some nice things about you.

250
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,478
Mr. Dobisch says you're loyal,
cooperative, resourceful.

251
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,798
- Mr. Dobisch said that?
- Mr. Kirkeby tells me you often work late...

252
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,071
...without overtime.
- You know how it is. Things pile up.

253
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,230
Mr. Vanderhof in Public Relations and
Mr. Eichelberger in Mortgage and Loans...

254
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,158
...would both like you
transferred to their departments.

255
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,111
Very flattering.

256
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:39,233
Tell me, Baxter. Just what is it
that makes you so popular?

257
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,636
- I don't know.
- Think.

258
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:51,559
- Would you mind repeating the question?
- Look, Baxter. I'm not stupid.

259
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:56,071
I know everything that goes on
in this building every day of the year.

260
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,599
You do?

261
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:02,077
In 1957 we had an employee here,
name of Fowler. He was very popular too.

262
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,794
It turned out
he was running a bookie joint...

263
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:08,310
...tying up our switchboard, using
our IBM machines to figure the odds.

264
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:12,558
The day before the Kentucky Derby I
called in the vice squad, who raided him.

265
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,636
- The vice squad?
- That's right.

266
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,911
What's that got to do with me?
I'm not running any bookie joint.

267
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:21,396
- Just what kind of joint are you running?
- Sir?

268
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:26,389
A key is floating around from Kirkeby
to Vanderhof to Eichelberger to Dobisch.

269
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,431
It's the key to a certain apartment.

270
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:31,836
- Know who that apartment belongs to?
- Who?

271
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,192
Loyal, resourceful, cooperative CC Baxter.

272
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,995
- Oh.
- Are you going to deny it?

273
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:44,755
No. I'm not going to deny it.
If you'd just let me explain.

274
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,152
You'd better.

275
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,236
Well...

276
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:54,476
...about a year ago, I was going to night
school, studying advanced accounting.

277
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:59,390
One of the guys in our department - lives
in Jersey - had to go to a banquet in town.

278
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,752
He needed someplace to change
into a tuxedo, so I gave him the key.

279
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:09,591
Word must've gotten out because all sorts
of guys were suddenly going to banquets.

280
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:14,396
You give the key to one guy, you can't
say no to another. It all got out of hand.

281
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,556
Baxter, an insurance company
is founded on public trust.

282
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,831
Any employee who conducts himself
in a manner unbecoming...

283
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,872
How many charter members
are there in this little club?

284
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,629
Just those four. Out of a total of 31,259.

285
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:34,673
So actually we can be very proud
of our personnel... percentagewise.

286
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:39,271
That's not the point. Four rotten apples
in a barrel, however large the barrel...

287
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,472
- Do you realize if this ever leaked out...
- It won't!

288
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:47,390
Believe me. Never again. Nobody
is gonna use my apartment from now on.

289
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,080
- Where is your apartment?
- West 67th Street.

290
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:55,479
You have no idea what I go through with
the neighbors, the landlady and the key.

291
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,556
How do you work it with the key?

292
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:02,356
I slip it to 'em in the office and they leave
it under a mat. Never again. I promise.

293
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:09,674
- Yes, Miss Olsen?
- Mrs. Sheldrake, returning your call. On 2.

294
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,036
<i>Yes, dear. Where were you?</i>

295
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:21,396
You had to take Tommy to the dentist?
No cavities? Good. Hold it, dear.

296
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,432
- Where are you going, Baxter?
- I don't wanna intrude.

297
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:27,757
- Since this is straightened out...
- I'm not through with you yet.

298
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,996
I won't be home for dinner tonight.

299
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:33,954
The branch manager from Kansas City
is in town. I'm taking him to the theater.

300
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,832
<i>Music Man</i>. What else?

301
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,394
No, don't wait up for me,
darling. Goodbye.

302
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,836
Tell me, Baxter.
Have you seen <i>Music Man</i>?

303
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,474
Not yet. I hear it's one swell show.

304
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,750
How would you like to go tonight?

305
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,998
You and me? I thought you were taking
the branch manager from Kansas City.

306
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,271
No, I have other plans.
You can have both tickets.

307
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,356
Well... that's very kind of you.

308
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:01,359
But I'm not feeling well. I've got
this cold. I'm gonna go right home.

309
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,916
Baxter, you're not reading me.
I told you I have plans.

310
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:08,392
So do I. I'm gonna take
four aspirins, get into bed.

311
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,670
So give the tickets to somebody else.

312
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:15,551
Look, Baxter. I'm not just giving
these tickets. I wanna swap them.

313
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,750
Swap 'em? For what?

314
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:24,590
It also says here that you are
alert, astute and quite imaginative.

315
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,631
Oh?

316
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,436
Oh...

317
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:47,439
That's good thinking, Baxter. There's
gonna be a shift in personnel next month.

318
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:51,269
And as far as I'm concerned,
you are executive material.

319
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,755
- I am?
- Now put down the key.

320
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,756
And put down the address.

321
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:05,629
It's on the second floor. There's no name
over the door. It just says apartment 2A.

322
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,471
- It's that cold.
- Relax, Baxter.

323
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,556
Yes, thank you, sir.

324
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:15,478
You will be careful with
the record player? Shh.

325
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,556
Oh, and about the liquor.

326
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:22,071
I ordered some this morning.
I don't know when they'll deliver it.

327
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,992
- This is going to be our little secret.
- Of course.

328
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,680
- You know how people talk.
- Don't worry about that.

329
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:32,395
- Not that I have anything to hide.
- No! Anyway, it's none of my business.

330
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:36,229
Four apples, five apples.
What's the difference?

331
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,316
Percentagewise.

332
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,908
Here you are, Baxter. Have a nice time.

333
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,996
You too, sir.

334
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:17,508
So I figure, a man in his position,
he'll take me to El Morocco, maybe 21.

335
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:21,997
Instead he takes me to Hamburger
Heaven and some schnook's apartment.

336
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,716
- Good night.
- Good night.

337
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,915
Oh! Miss Kubelik?

338
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:36,077
I've been waiting for you.
I almost didn't recognize you.

339
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,237
This is the first time
I've seen you in civilian clothes.

340
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,555
- How'd it go on the 27th floor?
- Great.

341
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,989
- Look, have you seen <i>The Music Man</i>?
- No.

342
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,678
- Would you like to?
- Sure.

343
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,030
We could get a bite to eat first,
and then go.

344
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,673
- Oh, you mean tonight?
- Yeah.

345
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,758
- I'm sorry, I can't. I'm meeting somebody.
- Oh.

346
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,316
- You mean... like a girlfriend?
- No. Like a man.

347
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:00,831
I wasn't trying to be personal. The fellas
in the office were wondering if you ever...

348
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,837
You tell 'em now and then.

349
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,112
This date, is it... just a date?
Or is it something serious?

350
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:10,550
Well, it used to be serious.
At least, <i>I</i> was. But he wasn't.

351
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,955
So now the whole thing's
more or less kaput.

352
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,594
- In that case, couldn't you...
- I'm afraid not.

353
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:19,679
I promised I'd have a drink with him.
He's been calling me all week.

354
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,470
I understand.

355
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:26,957
Well, it was just an idea. I hate
to see a theater ticket go to waste.

356
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:30,038
- What time does the show go on?
- 8.30.

357
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,435
Well, I could meet you at the theater.

358
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:36,473
That's wonderful!
It's the Majestic on 44th Street.

359
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,397
I'll meet you in the lobby.

360
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:41,876
You know, I felt so lousy
this morning. Had 101 fever.

361
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,356
Now along comes my promotion
and us - 11th row center.

362
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,357
And you said I should've stayed in bed.

363
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,550
- How is your cold?
- What cold?

364
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:53,559
After the show we could go out
on the town.

365
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,353
- I've been taking from Arthur Murray.
- So I see.

366
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,358
There's a great band
at El Chico, in the Village.

367
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,870
- Around the corner from where you live.
- Sounds good.

368
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,437
- How do you know where I live?
- Oh, I... even know who you live with.

369
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,516
Your sister and brother-in-law.

370
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:13,428
I know when you were born and where.
I know all sorts of things about you.

371
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,913
How come?

372
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:19,556
A couple of months ago I looked up
your card in the group insurance file.

373
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:23,434
I know your height and your weight
and your social security number.

374
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:27,314
You had mumps and measles
and you had your appendix out.

375
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,277
Don't mention the appendix
to the fellas in the office.

376
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:35,951
I wouldn't want 'em to get the wrong idea
about how you found out. Bye.

377
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,116
8.30!

378
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:31,953
- Good evening, Mr. Sheldrake.
- Please, Fran. Not so loud.

379
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,435
Still afraid someone
might see us together?

380
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,030
- Let me take your coat.
- No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.

381
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,392
- Can I have a frozen daiquiri?
- It's on the way.

382
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,750
- I see you went ahead and cut your hair.
- That's right.

383
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:50,077
- You know I liked it better long.
- I know.

384
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,953
You want a lock to carry in your wallet?

385
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:57,070
- Evening, lady. Nice to see you again.
- Thank you.

386
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,355
How long has it been, Fran? A month?

387
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,040
Six weeks. But who's counting?

388
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,036
I missed you.

389
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,436
Like old times.

390
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,154
Same booth. Same song.

391
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,959
- It's been hell.
- Same sauce. Sweet-and-sour.

392
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,472
You don't know what it's like,
next to you in that elevator.

393
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,672
"Good morning, Miss Kubelik."
"Good night, Mr. Sheldrake."

394
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,234
I'm still crazy about you, Fran.

395
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:34,639
Let's not start on that again, Jeff. Please?
I'm just beginning to get over it.

396
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,275
I don't believe you.

397
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,318
Look, Jeff. We had two
wonderful months this summer.

398
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,193
But that was it. Happens all the time.

399
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:49,279
Wife and kids go away to the country and
the boss has a fling with his secretary...

400
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,039
...or the manicurist, or the elevator girl.

401
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,436
Come September,
the picnic's over. Goodbye.

402
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:59,439
The kids go back to school,
the boss goes back to the wife...

403
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,516
...and the girl...

404
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,678
They don't make these shrimp
like they used to.

405
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,280
I never said goodbye, Fran.

406
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:17,914
For a while there, you try kidding yourself
that you're going with an unmarried man.

407
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,713
Then one day he keeps
looking at his watch...

408
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,354
...and asks you if any lipstick's showing...

409
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,836
...then rushes out to catch
the 7.14 to White Plains.

410
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,436
So you fix yourself
a cup of instant coffee...

411
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:35,155
...and you sit there
by yourself and you think...

412
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,271
...and it all begins to look so... ugly.

413
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:46,315
How do you think I felt
riding home on that 7.14 train?

414
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,479
Why do you keep calling me, Jeff?
What do you want from me?

415
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,556
I want you back, Fran.

416
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:56,434
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake. I'm full up.
You'll have to take the next elevator.

417
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,314
You're not giving me a chance, Fran.
I have something to tell you.

418
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:04,149
- Go ahead. Tell me.
- Not here. Can't we go someplace else?

419
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,999
- No. I have a date at 8.30.
- Oh?

420
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:11,035
- Important?
- Not very, but I'm gonna be there anyway.

421
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,720
- You ready order dinner now?
- No. No dinner.

422
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,229
Just bring us two more drinks, will you?

423
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,113
Fran, do you remember
that last weekend we had?

424
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:42,916
Do I! That leaky boat you rented, and me
in a black negligee and a life preserver.

425
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,315
Do you remember what we talked about?

426
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,910
- We talked about a lot of things.
- I mean about my getting a divorce.

427
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,315
<i>We</i> didn't talk about it, Jeff. You did.

428
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,396
You didn't believe me, did you?

429
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:57,798
They got it on a long-playing record now.
"Music to String Her Along By."

430
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:02,550
"My wife doesn't understand me. You're
the best thing that ever happened to me."

431
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,877
- That's enough, Fran.
- "Trust me, baby. We'll work it out."

432
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,594
- You're not being funny.
- I wasn't trying.

433
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,954
- Fran, just listen to me for a minute.
- All right. I'm sorry.

434
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:17,949
I saw my lawyer this morning. I wanted
his advice about the best way to handle it.

435
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,435
- Handle what?
- What do you think?

436
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:26,152
Let's get something straight, Jeff.
I never asked you to leave your wife.

437
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,919
Of course not. You had
nothing to do with it.

438
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,876
Are you sure that's what you want?

439
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:37,350
I'm sure... if you'll just tell me
that you still love me.

440
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,396
You know I do.

441
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,998
Fran.

442
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,476
Jeff, darling...

443
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,598
It is getting crowded. Let's get out of here.

444
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,159
Taxi!

445
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:37,716
- Jeff, I have that date, remember?
- But I love you, remember?

446
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,354
Where are we going?

447
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,153
- Not back to that leaky boat?
- I promise.

448
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,875
51 West 67th.

449
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,116
Congratulations.

450
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,758
Would you mind? CC Baxter - that's me.

451
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,076
Thank you.

452
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:14,076
Hi, Buddy-boy.
Congratulations and all that jazz.

453
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,556
- Hi, fellas.
- Well, you made it, just like we promised.

454
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,752
Quite an office.
Name on the door, rug on the floor.

455
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:25,396
Teamwork: that's what counts in this
organization. All for one and one for all.

456
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,476
- Know what I mean?
- I have a vague idea.

457
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,637
Baxter, we're a little disappointed
in you, gratitudewise.

458
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:34,070
- Oh, I'm very grateful.
- Then why are you locking us out?

459
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:39,593
Well, it's been sort of rough the past few
weeks, what with my cold and... like that.

460
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:42,439
We went to bat for you.
Now you won't play ball with us.

461
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:46,712
After all, it's my apartment. It's
private property, not a public playground.

462
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:50,913
So you got yourself a girl. That's OK
with us. But not every night in the week!

463
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,712
How selfish can you get?

464
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:56,469
Last week I had to use my nephew's car
and take Sylvia to a drive-in in Jersey.

465
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,512
I'm too old for that sort of thing -
I mean in a Volkswagen.

466
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:02,757
I sympathize with you.
Believe me, I'm very sorry.

467
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,077
- You'll be a lot sorrier.
- Are you threatening me?

468
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:09,158
Listen, Baxter. We made you
and we can break you.

469
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:13,158
- Good morning, Mr. Sheldrake.
- Good morning, gentlemen.

470
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,239
- Baxter, do you like your office?
- Yes, sir. I wanna thank you very much.

471
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:20,158
Don't thank me.
Your friends here recommended you.

472
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:23,909
- We just dropped by to wish him luck.
- We know you won't let us down.

473
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:28,591
So long, fellas. Drop in any time.
The door is always open... to my office.

474
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,431
I like the way you handled that, Baxter.

475
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:34,028
- How does it feel to be an executive?
- Oh, fine.

476
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:37,835
- I'll work hard to justify your confidence.
- I'm sure you will.

477
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:42,556
About the apartment. Now that you've got
a raise, can't we afford a second key?

478
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,989
- I guess so.
- You know my secretary, Miss Olsen?

479
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,793
- Oh, yeah. Is she the lucky girl that...?
- Oh, no, no.

480
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:52,994
I just meant that she's kind of a busybody,
and passing that key back and forth...

481
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,634
- Why take chances?
- You can't be too careful.

482
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,672
Oh, I... have something
I think belongs to you.

483
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,234
- Me?
- I mean the young lady, whoever she is.

484
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,999
- I found it when I got back last night.
- Oh. Thanks.

485
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:07,476
The mirror is broken.
It was broken when I found it.

486
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,839
- Yeah. She threw it at me.
- Sir?

487
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,349
You know how it is.
They always give you a bad time.

488
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,515
Yeah, I know how it is.

489
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:20,191
You see a girl every week for laughs and
they think you're gonna divorce your wife.

490
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:23,392
- Now I ask you, is that fair?
- No, sir. It's very unfair.

491
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,431
- Especially to your wife.
- Yeah.

492
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:30,231
You know, Baxter, I envy you. A bachelor,
all the dames you want, no complications.

493
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,873
That's the life all right.

494
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,195
- Put me down for Thursday again.
- Roger.

495
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,470
And I'll get that other key.

496
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:51,909
- Merry Christmas. I'll connect you.
- Merry Christmas. Consolidated Life.

497
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,951
Merry Christmas. I'm ringing.

498
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:56,036
Yeah? Yeah?!

499
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,229
Where?

500
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,554
You bet!

501
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:02,832
Somebody watch my line. There's
a swingin' party on the 19th floor!

502
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:35,639
So I said to him "Never again. Either you
get yourself a bigger car or a smaller girl."

503
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,436
Miss Kubelik? Miss...

504
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,796
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.

505
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,878
- I thought you were avoiding me.
- What gave you that idea?

506
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,629
In six weeks you've only been in my
elevator once, and you kept on your hat.

507
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,070
As a matter of fact, I was rather hurt
that night you stood me up.

508
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,156
I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.

509
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,838
- I forgive you.
- You shouldn't.

510
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:06,316
You couldn't help it. You can't
suddenly walk out on one man...

511
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,590
...because you have a date
with another man.

512
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,995
- You did the decent thing.
- Don't be too sure.

513
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:14,476
Just because I wear a uniform,
that doesn't make me a Girl Scout.

514
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:19,151
A second administrative assistant has
to be a pretty good judge of character.

515
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,669
And as far as I'm concerned, you're tops.

516
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:26,316
I mean decencywise and... otherwisewise.

517
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,396
Cheers.

518
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:32,310
- One more.
- I shouldn't drink while driving.

519
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:37,355
You're so right. By the power vested
in me, I declare this elevator out of order.

520
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:39,755
Shall we join the natives?

521
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:43,270
- Why not? They seem friendly enough.
- Don't you believe it.

522
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:47,359
There'll be human sacrifices. White-collar
workers tossed into computers...

523
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:49,630
...and punched full of little square holes.

524
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,876
- How many drinks did you have?
- Three!

525
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,072
- I thought so.
- Wait. I hear the sound of running water.

526
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,668
- I'll be right back!
- I'll be right here.

527
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:00,672
Hi!

528
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,314
How's the branch manager
from Kansas City?

529
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,078
- I beg your pardon?
- I'm Miss Olsen.

530
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,077
Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.

531
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,475
So you don't have to
play innocent with me.

532
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:13,479
He used to tell his wife
I was the branch manager from Seattle...

533
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:17,673
...four years ago when we were having
a little ring-a-ding-ding.

534
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:22,559
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Before me it was Miss Rossi in Auditing.

535
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:25,240
And after me it was
Miss Koch in Disability.

536
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:27,635
And right before you was a Miss, um...

537
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,035
Oh, what's her name? On the 25th floor.

538
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,596
- Would you excuse me?
- What for? You haven't done anything.

539
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:36,792
It's him. Oh, what a salesman!

540
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,635
Always the last booth
in the Chinese restaurant...

541
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,718
...and the same pitch
about divorcing his wife.

542
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:49,038
Then, in the end, you wind up
with egg foo yung on your face.

543
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:51,116
Miss Kubelik!

544
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,838
Well, thank you, Miss Olsen.

545
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,919
Always happy to do a little something
for our girls in uniform.

546
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:02,150
Are you all right? What's the matter?

547
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:04,748
Nothing. There are just
too many people here.

548
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:08,668
Why don't we step into my office? There's
something I want your opinion about.

549
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:13,396
I have my own office now. I'm the second
youngest executive in this company.

550
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:17,069
The only one younger is a grandson
of the chairman of the board.

551
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:20,236
Do you mind?

552
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:27,636
Miss Kubelik, I would like
your honest opinion.

553
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:30,911
I've had this under my desk
for a week. It cost me $15.

554
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:34,191
I haven't been able
to get up enough nerve to wear it.

555
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:44,395
It's what they call the Junior Executive
model. What do you think?

556
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:50,513
I guess I made a boo-boo, huh?

557
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,790
- I like it.
- Really?

558
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:55,718
You wouldn't be ashamed to be seen
with somebody in this hat?

559
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:59,674
- Of course not.
- Maybe if I wore it a little to one side.

560
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:02,439
- Is that better?
- Much better.

561
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:05,154
Since you wouldn't be
ashamed to be seen with me...

562
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,272
...how about goin' out tonight -
you, me and the bowler?

563
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,119
We'll stroll down 5th Avenue,
sort of break it in.

564
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:14,915
- This is a bad day for me.
- I understand. Christmas and family.

565
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,349
I'd better get back to my elevator
or I'll be fired.

566
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:21,155
Don't worry about that. I've got
quite a bit of influence with Personnel.

567
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,236
You know Mr. Sheldrake?

568
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:26,955
- Why?
- He and I are like that.

569
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:29,640
Sent me a Christmas card. See?

570
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:37,759
Makes a cute picture.

571
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:41,274
I could talk to Mr. Sheldrake.
Get you a promotion.

572
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:46,872
- Would you like to be an elevator starter?
- Too many girls have seniority over me.

573
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,238
No problem. Why don't we
discuss it over the holidays?

574
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:54,592
I could call you, pick you up, have
a big unveiling. Am I wearing this right?

575
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,790
I think so. Here.

576
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:59,832
It's not tilted too much?
This is a conservative firm.

577
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:02,918
I don't want people
to think I'm an entertainer.

578
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,156
What's the matter?

579
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:14,189
- The mirror. It's broken.
- Yes, I know.

580
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:18,152
I like it that way.
Makes me look the way I feel.

581
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:24,236
Your phone.

582
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,636
Yes?

583
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:33,952
Uh, just a minute.

584
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:38,437
- If you don't mind, this is sort of personal.
- Have a nice Christmas.

585
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:46,876
Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.

586
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:53,040
No, I didn't forget. The tree is up and the
Tom and Jerry mix is in the refrigerator.

587
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:55,116
Yes, sir. Same to you.

588
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,669
Hey! Where are you goin', Buddy-boy?

589
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:25,950
The party's just starting.

590
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:29,356
Listen, kid. Gimme a break.
How about tomorrow afternoon?

591
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:34,759
I can't take her to that drive-in again.
The car has no heater. Four o'clock. OK?

592
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:14,878
Hey, Charlie! Gimme a shot of bourbon,
and step on it! My sleigh is double-parked!

593
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:22,512
You buy me a drink,
I'll buy you some music.

594
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,596
Rum Collins.

595
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:35,594
Uh...

596
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:39,190
Rum Collins and...
another one of these little mothers.

597
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,717
You like Castro?

598
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:55,559
I mean, how do you feel about Castro?

599
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:59,355
- What is Castro?
- You know. That big shot down in Cuba.

600
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:01,550
- With the crazy beard.
- What about him?

601
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:04,831
Cos as far as I'm concerned,
he's a no-good fink.

602
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:08,191
Two weeks ago I wrote him a letter.
Never even answered me.

603
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:09,275
That so?

604
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:13,075
All I wanted him to do was
let Mickey out for Christmas.

605
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,156
- Who's Mickey?
- My husband.

606
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,748
He's in Havana, in jail.

607
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:21,270
- Mixed up in that revolution?
- Mickey would do nothin' like that.

608
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:25,029
He's a jockey.
They caught him dopin' a horse.

609
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,310
Well, you can't win 'em all.

610
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:35,795
'Twas the night before Christmas,
and all through the house

611
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,876
Not a creature was stirrin'...

612
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,598
Nothin'. No action.

613
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:43,951
Dullsville.

614
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:46,116
- You married?
- No.

615
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,196
- Family?
- No.

616
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,357
A night like this, it sort of spooks you
to walk into an empty apartment.

617
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:58,839
I said I had no family. I didn't say
I had an empty apartment.

618
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,875
Come on, Fran. Don't be that way.

619
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:09,438
Are you just gonna
sit there and keep bawling?

620
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:12,711
You won't talk to me?
You won't tell me what's wrong?

621
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:19,269
I know you think I'm stalling you but...
when you've been married for 12 years...

622
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:23,791
...you just don't sit down to breakfast and
say "Pass the sugar. I want a divorce."

623
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:26,388
It's not that easy.

624
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:32,230
Anyway, this is the wrong time. The kids
are off school, my in-laws are visiting.

625
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:34,316
I can't bring it up now.

626
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:40,909
This isn't like you, Fran. You were always
such a good sport. Such fun to be with.

627
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:47,358
That's me. The happy idiot.
A million laughs.

628
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:52,353
Well, that's a little more like it.
At least you're speaking to me.

629
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,590
A funny thing happened to me
at the office party today.

630
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:59,075
I ran into your secretary, Miss Olsen.

631
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:01,996
You know. Ring-a-ding-ding?

632
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:05,793
And I laughed so much, I like to died.

633
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:10,357
Is that what's been bothering you, Fran?
Miss Olsen? That's ancient history.

634
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:13,438
Well, I never was very good at history.

635
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:18,193
Let me see. There was Miss Olsen,
and then there was Miss Rossi.

636
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:21,312
No, she came before.
Miss Koch came after Miss Olsen.

637
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,749
- Now, Fran...
- And just think.

638
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:27,589
Right now some lucky girl in the building
is gonna come after me.

639
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:30,359
OK. OK, Fran. I guess I deserved that.

640
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:34,439
But ask yourself: why does a man
run around with a lot of girls?

641
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:38,189
Because he's unhappy at home.
Because he's lonely. That's why.

642
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:41,437
But that was before you, Fran.
I've stopped running.

643
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:46,879
How could I be so stupid?
You'd think I would've learned by now.

644
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,357
When you're in love with a married man,
you shouldn't wear mascara.

645
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:55,072
It's Christmas Eve, Fran.
Let's not fight, huh?

646
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,635
- Merry Christmas.
- What is it?

647
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:07,480
Oh. Our friend at the Chinese restaurant.

648
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:13,754
- Thanks, Fran. We'd better keep it here.
- Yeah, we'd better.

649
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,516
Oh, I have a present for you.

650
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:20,838
I didn't know what to get you. Besides,
it's kind of awkward for me shopping, so...

651
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:24,316
Here's $100. You go
and buy yourself something.

652
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:32,152
They have some nice
alligator bags at Bergdorf's.

653
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:47,399
I didn't realize it was so late. It's quarter
to seven. I mustn't miss my train.

654
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:51,877
If we hadn't wasted all this time...
I have to get home and trim the tree.

655
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:56,149
OK. I just thought,
as long as it was paid for...

656
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:58,316
Don't ever talk like that, Fran.

657
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:02,399
- Don't make yourself out to be cheap.
- $100? I don't call that cheap.

658
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:06,479
And you must be paying somebody
something for the use of the apartment.

659
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:08,556
Stop it, Fran.

660
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,556
You'll miss your train, Jeff.

661
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,398
Are you coming?

662
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,080
No, you run along. I'm gonna fix my face.

663
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:26,634
Don't forget to kill the lights.
See you Monday.

664
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:30,196
Sure. Monday... and Thursday...

665
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:33,437
...and Monday again, and Thursday again.

666
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:38,118
It won't always be like this, Fran.

667
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:40,310
I love you.

668
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:42,590
Careful. Lipstick.

669
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:45,836
Merry Christmas.

670
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:09,910
- Drink up, pop. It's closing time.
- But it's early, Charlie.

671
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:13,476
- Don't you know what night this is?
- I know, Charlie. I know.

672
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:15,556
I work for the outfit.

673
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:23,559
Hey, knock it off, will ya? Go home.

674
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,556
O-U-T. Out!

675
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:40,840
Where'll we go? My place or yours?

676
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:46,557
Might as well go to mine.
Everybody else does.

677
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:02,954
Poor Mickey. When I think of him
all by himself in that jail in Havana...

678
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:05,230
Would you like to see his picture?

679
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:07,316
Not particularly.

680
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:13,270
He's so cute. He's 5 foot 2, 99 pounds.

681
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:15,356
Like a little Chihuahua.

682
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:30,712
- Can I ask you a personal question?
- No.

683
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:32,717
You got a girlfriend?

684
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:35,593
She may be a girl
but she is no friend of mine.

685
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:39,713
- Still stuck on her, huh?
- Obviously you don't know me very well.

686
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:42,474
- I don't know you at all.
- Permit me.

687
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:49,109
CC Baxter. Junior executive,
Arthur Murray graduate... lover.

688
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:52,471
I'm Mrs. MacDougall. Margie to you.

689
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:55,756
This way, Mrs. MacDougall.

690
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:08,519
Say! This is snugsville!

691
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:11,154
Mrs. MacDougall,
it's only fair to warn you...

692
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:14,511
...you are now alone
with a notorious sexpot.

693
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:17,200
- No kiddin'!
- Ask anybody around here.

694
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:21,233
As a matter of fact, when it's time for me
to go - and I may go just like that -

695
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:24,158
I have promised my body
to the Columbia Medical Center.

696
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:27,158
Gee! Sort of gives you goose bumps
just to think about it.

697
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:30,431
They haven't got me yet, baby.
Dig up some ice from the kitchen.

698
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:33,358
Let's not waste any more time
preliminarywise.

699
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:35,436
I'm with you, lover.

700
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:51,275
All right, Miss Kubelik. Get up.

701
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:54,156
Come on. It's past checking-out time.

702
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:58,478
The management would appreciate it
if you'd get the hell outta here.

703
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:06,280
I used to like you. I used to like you a lot.
Well, it's all over between us, so beat it.

704
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:08,876
O-U-T, out!

705
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,956
Come on, wake up.

706
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:20,196
Oh my God.

707
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:22,276
Miss Kubelik?

708
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:24,916
Miss Kubelik?

709
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:37,118
I broke a nail tryin' to get the tray out.

710
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:40,198
You oughta buy yourself
a new refrigerator.

711
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:44,272
I didn't mean right now!

712
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:49,116
Dr. Dreyfuss.

713
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:51,636
Doc!

714
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:56,479
There's a girl in my place, took
some sleeping pills. I can't wake her up.

715
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:58,556
- Let me get my bag.
- Hurry up!

716
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:03,870
Hey, over here, lover.
What's all the running around about?

717
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,560
You're gonna wear yourself out.

718
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:09,828
- Not so rough, honey!
- Good night.

719
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:11,916
- Good night?!
- The party's over.

720
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:14,156
What? Did I do somethin' wrong?

721
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:17,477
It's an emergency.
I'll see you some other time.

722
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:19,556
Not this one. In there, Doc.

723
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:24,115
- What's goin' on here, anyway?
- Will you please just get out?!

724
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:25,719
My shoes!

725
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:28,718
Some lover you are! Some sexpot!

726
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:31,479
Here. Find a phone.
Call your husband in Havana.

727
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:36,833
You bet I will! And when I tell him how
you treated me, he'll push your face in!

728
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:38,916
You fink!

729
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:55,796
Is she gonna be all right, Doc?

730
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:59,799
- How many pills were in that bottle?
- It was half-full. About a dozen.

731
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:02,798
- Do you have to take her to the hospital?
- Help me, will you?

732
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:05,480
- Into the bathroom.
- What are you gonna do?

733
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:08,273
Get that stuff out of her stomach
if it isn't too late.

734
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:10,960
You'd better put some coffee on,
and pray.

735
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:05,596
Bring my bag.

736
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:16,996
Roll up her right sleeve.

737
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:28,356
Hold that.

738
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:37,036
Nice veins.

739
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:51,039
Wanna tell me what happened?

740
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:53,720
I don't know. I mean, I wasn't even here.

741
01:07:56,640 --> 01:08:00,269
You see, we had... some words earlier.

742
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:04,359
It was nothin' serious.
You might call it a lovers' quarrel.

743
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:08,118
So you went right out
and picked yourself up another dame.

744
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:12,836
- Something like that.
- You know, Baxter, you're a real cutie pie.

745
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:14,439
Yes, you are.

746
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:27,195
If you'd come home half an hour later,
you'd have had quite a Christmas present.

747
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:47,196
Get the coffee.

748
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:12,559
Let's get some air in here.
Open the windows.

749
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:29,196
What's her name?

750
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:31,914
Miss Kubelik. Fran.

751
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:40,188
Fran, I'm a doctor. I'm here because
you took too many sleeping pills.

752
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:42,436
Do you understand what I'm saying?

753
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:47,430
Fran, I'm Dr. Dreyfuss.
I'm here to help you.

754
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:50,358
You took all those sleeping pills.
Remember?

755
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:54,990
- Sleeping pills.
- That's right, Fran. And I'm a doctor.

756
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:58,519
- Doctor?
- Dr. Dreyfuss.

757
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:02,433
Dreyfuss.

758
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:04,516
Get more coffee.

759
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:07,755
Now tell me again. What's my name?

760
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:13,115
Dr... Dreyfuss.

761
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:15,196
And what happened to you?

762
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:17,398
I...

763
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:19,476
I took sleeping pills.

764
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:22,395
Do you know where you are?

765
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:27,471
- No.
- Yes, you do, Fran. Now concentrate!

766
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:31,276
I don't know.

767
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:34,116
Do you know who that is?

768
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:42,556
Look at him.

769
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:46,353
Mr. Baxter. 19th floor.

770
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:48,996
Hello, Miss Kubelik.

771
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:51,874
Mr.? Miss? Such politeness!

772
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:56,954
We work in the same building.
We try to keep it quiet.

773
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:01,120
What are you doing here?

774
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:06,235
Don't you remember
we were together at the office party?

775
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:08,669
Oh, yes. The office party.

776
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:11,268
- Miss Olsen.
- That's right.

777
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:14,233
I told you we had a fight.
That was what it was about.

778
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:17,557
Miss Olsen. That girl
that was here earlier.

779
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:21,674
I don't understand.

780
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:26,954
The main thing is I got here in time and
you're gonna be all right. Isn't she, Doc?

781
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:30,035
I'm so tired.

782
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:32,116
Come on. Drink this.

783
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:35,074
Please... just let me sleep.

784
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:38,829
No, you can't sleep! Fran, open your eyes!

785
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:41,436
Let's get her walking.

786
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:48,437
We've got to keep her awake for the next
few hours. Now come on, Fran, walk!

787
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:51,028
One, two, three, four!

788
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:53,355
One, two, three, four!

789
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:55,596
Left, right, left, right...

790
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:57,870
...left, right and return!

791
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:01,072
And... one, two, three, four!

792
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:04,476
Now you've got it! One, two, three, four!

793
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:07,717
Walk, Fran! One, two, three, four!

794
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:10,400
One, two... And return again.

795
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:13,512
And... left, right, left, right.

796
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:23,637
She'll sleep on and off
for the next 24 hours.

797
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:27,309
Of course, she'll have
a dandy hangover when she wakes up.

798
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:29,396
Just as long as she's OK.

799
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:34,799
These cases are harder on the doctor than
the patient. I oughta charge by the mile.

800
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:37,878
- Any of that coffee left?
- Yeah, sure.

801
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:41,195
How do you spell her last name?

802
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:43,709
Kubelik. Two <i>k's</i>.

803
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:45,796
What's her address?

804
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:48,476
Where does she live?

805
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:51,795
Why do you wanna know, Doc?

806
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:55,877
- You don't have to report this, do you?
- It's regulations.

807
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:00,790
But it was an accident. She had too much
to drink, didn't know what she was doing.

808
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:02,990
There was no suicide note or anything.

809
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:06,112
- I'm not thinkin' about myself.
- Aren't you?

810
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:09,596
She's got a family,
and there's the people at the office.

811
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:13,474
Can't you forget you're a doctor,
just say you're here as a neighbor?

812
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:16,353
Well, as a doctor, I can't prove
it wasn't an accident.

813
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:19,552
But as your neighbor,
I'd like to kick you around the block.

814
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:22,114
- Mind if I cool this off?
- Help yourself.

815
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:24,549
I don't know what you did to that girl...

816
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:27,114
...but it was bound to happen,
the way you carry on.

817
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:29,595
Live now, pay later. Diners Club!

818
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:34,313
Why don't you grow up, Baxter?
Be a <i>mensch</i>.

819
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:36,749
- You know what that means?
- I'm not sure.

820
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:38,836
A <i>mensch</i>! A human being!

821
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:42,712
So you got off easy this time.
So you were lucky.

822
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:47,311
But you're not out of the woods yet,
because most of 'em try it again.

823
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:50,788
Well, you know where I am
if you need me.

824
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:02,513
Mr. Baxter! Open up already.

825
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:07,551
Oh.

826
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:10,956
- Mrs. Lieberman.
- Who did you think it was? Kriss Kringle?

827
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:13,116
What was going on here last night?

828
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:16,471
- Last night?
- All that marching! Tramp, tramp, tramp!

829
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:19,876
- Army maneuvers maybe?
- I'll never invite those people again.

830
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:24,039
What you get from renting to bachelors.
All night I didn't sleep ten minutes.

831
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:29,439
- And I'm sure you woke up Dr. Dreyfuss.
- Don't worry. He was out on a case.

832
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:34,475
I'm warning you, Mr. Baxter. This is
a respectable house, not a honky-tonky.

833
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:36,556
Come on, Oscar.

834
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:06,911
Operator, I want White Plains,
New York. Mr. JD Sheldrake.

835
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:08,996
Make that person-to-person.

836
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:12,512
Five, four, three, two, one...

837
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:15,108
Let her rip!

838
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:16,798
I'll get the phone.

839
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:19,753
Hey, Dad, why don't we
put a fly in the nose cone?

840
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:22,678
- See if we can bring it back alive.
- That's a thought.

841
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:26,713
Maybe we should put in two flies
and see if they'll propagate in orbit.

842
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:30,833
- See if they'll what?
- Propagate. You know. Multiply.

843
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:34,509
- Baby flies?
- Oh. Oh!

844
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:37,788
- It's for you, Dad.
- Thanks, Jeff.

845
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:40,992
A Mr. Baxter. Person-to-person.

846
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:43,634
Come on. Help me round up some flies.

847
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:48,311
- Hello? What's on your mind, Baxter?
- Something came up that's important.

848
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:51,876
I think you should see me
at the apartment as soon as possible.

849
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:55,595
- What's this all about?
- I didn't wanna tell you over the phone.

850
01:16:55,720 --> 01:17:00,635
But that certain party... You know
who I mean. I found her here last night.

851
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:03,752
- She took an overdose of sleeping pills.
- What?!

852
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:08,914
- What is it, Jeff? Who's on the phone?
- One of our employees had an accident.

853
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:12,316
I don't know why they bother me
with these things on Christmas Day.

854
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:14,192
Yes, Baxter.

855
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:16,276
Just how serious is it?

856
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:19,915
It was touch and go there for a while,
but she's sleeping it off now.

857
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:22,918
I thought maybe you'd like to
be here when she wakes up.

858
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:28,238
That's impossible. You'll have to
handle the situation yourself, Baxter.

859
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:32,592
- As a matter of fact, I'm counting on you.
- Yes, sir. I understand.

860
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:36,918
She left a letter. Would you like me
to open it and read it to you?

861
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:39,679
Well, it was just a suggestion.

862
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:43,554
No, don't worry. I kept your name
out of it, so there'll be no trouble...

863
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:46,035
...policewise or newspaperwise.

864
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:51,438
You see, the doctor is a friend of mine,
so we were very lucky in that respect.

865
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:53,915
Actually, he thinks she's my girl.

866
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:56,910
No, he just jumped to the conclusion.

867
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:59,759
Around here I'm known as
quite a ladies' man.

868
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:03,953
Of course, we're not out of the woods yet.
Sometimes they try it again.

869
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:07,834
Yes, sir. I'll do my best. It'll take her
a couple of days to fully recover...

870
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:11,111
...and I may have a little problem
with the landlady.

871
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:15,110
OK, Mr. Sheldrake. I'll keep her
in the apartment as long as I can.

872
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:18,630
Isn't there some sort of message
you want me to give her?

873
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:21,196
Well, I'll... think of something.

874
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:23,796
Yes, sir. Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.

875
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:28,516
I'm sorry.

876
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:32,710
- I'm sorry, Mr. Baxter.
- What are you doing out of bed?

877
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:35,912
I didn't know. I had no idea
this was your apartment.

878
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:38,634
Here. Let me help you.

879
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:41,076
Oh, I'm so ashamed.

880
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:43,156
Why didn't you just let me die?

881
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:48,638
What kind of talk is that? You got
a little overemotional, but you're fine now.

882
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:50,159
Oh!

883
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:54,432
Oh, my head! It feels just like
a big wad of chewing gum.

884
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:57,199
- What time is it?
- Two o'clock.

885
01:18:57,320 --> 01:18:59,470
Oh, my dress. I have to go home.

886
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:01,955
You're in no shape
to go anywhere but back to bed.

887
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:04,469
- You don't want me here.
- Sure I do. I...

888
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:07,592
It's always nice
to have company for Christmas.

889
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:11,110
- I'm stronger than you are.
- I just wanna brush my teeth.

890
01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:14,630
Oh. Of course. I think I can find
a new toothbrush somewhere.

891
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:17,320
Here. Put that on.

892
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:48,435
- How about some breakfast?
- No. I don't want anything.

893
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:50,516
I'll fix you some coffee.

894
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:54,792
Oh! We're all out of coffee.
You had quite a lot last night.

895
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:56,876
Back in a minute.

896
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:08,150
Mrs. Dreyfuss,
could I borrow some coffee?

897
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:11,909
- And an orange and a couple of eggs?
- Eggs, he asks me for! Oranges!

898
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:16,352
What you need is a good horsewhipping!
From me the doctor has no secrets.

899
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:18,630
Poor girl. How could you do such a thing?

900
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:21,593
I didn't do anything. Honest. It's just...

901
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:27,719
You take a girl out just for laughs and
she thinks you're serious marriagewise.

902
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:31,196
Big shot! For you, I wouldn't lift a finger!

903
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:34,278
But for her, I'll fix a little something to eat.

904
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:44,152
Who are you calling?

905
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:46,316
My sister, to tell her
what happened to me.

906
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:51,195
Wait a minute! Let's talk it over first.
Just what are you gonna tell her?

907
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:55,748
- I haven't figured it out exactly.
- Well, you'd better figure it out exactly.

908
01:20:55,880 --> 01:20:58,838
Suppose she asks you why
you didn't come home last night.

909
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:00,837
I'll say I spent the night with a friend.

910
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:02,916
- Who?
- Someone from the office.

911
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:04,792
- Where are you now?
- In his apartment.

912
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:07,195
- In <i>his</i> apartment?
- In <i>her</i> apartment.

913
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:09,436
- What's your friend's name?
- Baxter.

914
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:12,518
- What's her first name?
- Miss.

915
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:15,359
- When are you comin' home?
- As soon as I can walk.

916
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:17,436
- Your legs hurt?
- No, my stomach.

917
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:20,233
- Your stomach?
- They had to pump it out!

918
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:25,070
You shouldn't call anybody. Not till you
get the chewing gum out of your head.

919
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:28,237
They'll be worried about me.
They might call the police.

920
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:31,432
We have to be careful.
We don't wanna involve anybody.

921
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:34,518
After all, Mr. Sheldrake's a married man.

922
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:37,276
Thanks for reminding me!

923
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:42,876
I didn't mean it that way.

924
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:46,959
I was just talking to him on the phone.
He's very concerned about you.

925
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:49,719
He doesn't give a damn about me.

926
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:53,435
- You're wrong. He told me...
- He's a liar.

927
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:55,710
But that's not the worst part.

928
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:58,115
The worst part is I still love him.

929
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,116
Oh. That must be Mrs. Dreyfuss.

930
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:07,550
Remember the doctor from last night?
That's his wife.

931
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:11,156
So where's the victim?

932
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:14,116
Max the Knife!

933
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:20,713
- <i>Nu</i>, little lady, how are we feeling today?
- I don't know. Kind of dizzy.

934
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:25,994
The best thing for dizzy is noodle soup
with chicken white meat and a glass tea.

935
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:30,398
- No, thank you. I'm really not hungry.
- Go ahead, eat. Enjoy.

936
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:33,318
You wouldn't have such a thing
as a napkin, would you?

937
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:36,512
- I have some paper towels.
- Beatnik.

938
01:22:36,640 --> 01:22:39,996
In my kitchen, third drawer,
under the good silver, are napkins.

939
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:41,439
Yes, Mrs. Dreyfuss.

940
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:44,074
So, what are you waiting for?
A singing commercial?

941
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:46,156
- I can't eat.
- You must eat.

942
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:49,317
And you must get healthy
and you must forget him.

943
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:52,591
Such a fine boy he seemed
when he first moved in here.

944
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:55,598
Clean and cut, a regular Ivy Leaguer.

945
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:59,998
Turns out he's King Farouk,
with the drinking, with the cha-cha.

946
01:23:00,120 --> 01:23:02,076
With the no napkins.

947
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:06,079
A girl like you, for the rest of your life
you wanna cry in your noodle soup?

948
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:08,668
Who needs it? Now you listen to me.

949
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:12,793
You'll find yourself a nice,
substantial man - a widower, maybe -

950
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:16,435
and settle down, instead of
<i>noshing</i> all those sleeping pills.

951
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:19,597
For what? For whom?
For some good-time Charlie?

952
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:21,551
Shh.

953
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:25,559
One napkin comin' up. Wish we had
some champagne to wrap it around.

954
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:28,717
- What did I tell you?
- Mrs. Dreyfuss, you don't have to wait.

955
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:32,628
- I'll wash the dishes.
- You'd break 'em. I'll come back for them.

956
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:35,149
If he makes trouble, give me a yell.

957
01:23:36,440 --> 01:23:40,115
- She doesn't seem to like you very much.
- Oh, I don't mind.

958
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:42,708
As a matter of fact, I'm sort of flattered.

959
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:47,789
That anybody'd think a girl like you would
do a thing like this over a guy like me.

960
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:51,918
Did you find something here?
An envelope?

961
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:53,553
Yes. I've got it.

962
01:23:53,680 --> 01:23:57,878
Don't you think we'd better destroy it
so it won't fall in the wrong hands?

963
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,956
Open it.

964
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:05,948
There's nothing here but a $100 bill.

965
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:09,311
That's right. Will you see
that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?

966
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:12,396
Sure.

967
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:15,796
Take this away, will you?

968
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:19,233
Would you like me to move
the television set in here?

969
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:21,999
- You play gin rummy?
- I'm not very good at it.

970
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:25,954
- I am. Let me get the cards.
- You don't have to entertain me.

971
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:29,675
There's nothing I'd like better.
You know. Togetherness.

972
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:34,316
Guess what I did last Christmas. Had
dinner at the automat, went to the zoo...

973
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:37,113
...then came home and cleaned up
after Mr. Eichelberger.

974
01:24:37,240 --> 01:24:39,515
He had a little eggnog party here.

975
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:41,835
So I'm way ahead this year.

976
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:44,599
Three across. Spades double?

977
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:46,676
High deals.

978
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:49,276
Six? Eight.

979
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:59,713
I think I'm gonna give it all up.

980
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:02,592
Give what up?

981
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:08,398
Why do people have to
love people, anyway?

982
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:11,716
I know what you mean.

983
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:16,796
Queen.

984
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:21,795
- I don't want it.
- Pick a card.

985
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:30,638
What do you call it when somebody keeps
gettin' smashed up in car accidents?

986
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:33,911
- Bad insurance risk?
- That's me with men.

987
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:40,116
I was jinxed from the word go. First time
I was ever kissed was in a cemetery.

988
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:42,276
A cemetery?

989
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:45,039
I was 15. We used to go there to smoke.

990
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:49,119
His name was George and
he threw me over for a drum majorette.

991
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:52,476
Uh, gin.

992
01:25:55,760 --> 01:26:00,834
That's 10, 20... 36.
And 25 makes 61 and two boxes.

993
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:02,951
I have this talent for falling in love...

994
01:26:03,080 --> 01:26:06,390
...with the wrong guy
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

995
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:09,190
Well, how many guys were there?

996
01:26:10,360 --> 01:26:12,112
Three.

997
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:16,028
The last one was the manager of a finance
company back home in Pittsburgh.

998
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:18,116
They found a shortage in his accounts.

999
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:21,835
He asked me to wait for him.
He'll be out in 1965.

1000
01:26:23,320 --> 01:26:25,276
Cut.

1001
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:30,789
So I came to New York and moved in with
my sister and her husband, a cab driver.

1002
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:35,596
They sent me to secretarial school and
then I applied for a job at Consolidated.

1003
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:37,836
But I flunked the typing test.

1004
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:40,633
- Too slow?
- No. I can type up a storm.

1005
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:42,716
I just can't spell.

1006
01:26:43,720 --> 01:26:48,589
So they gave me a pair of white gloves
and stuck me in an elevator.

1007
01:26:48,720 --> 01:26:51,075
And that's how I met Jeff.

1008
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:54,800
Oh God, I'm so fouled up.

1009
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:57,229
What am I gonna do now?

1010
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:01,476
Better win a hand. You're on a blitz.

1011
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:05,793
Was he very upset when you told him?

1012
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:07,876
Mr. Sheldrake? Yeah, very.

1013
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:12,669
Maybe he does love me, only he doesn't
have the nerve to tell his wife.

1014
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:14,199
I'm sure that's it.

1015
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:17,551
- You really think so?
- No doubt about it.

1016
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:21,115
Would you hand me that pad and pencil?

1017
01:27:21,240 --> 01:27:24,152
- What for?
- I'm gonna write to Mrs. Sheldrake.

1018
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:26,510
- You what?
- As one woman to another.

1019
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:30,428
- I'm sure she'll understand.
- I don't think that's a very good idea.

1020
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:33,836
- Why not?
- For one thing, you can't spell.

1021
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:37,919
Secondly, if you did something
like that, you'd hate yourself.

1022
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:41,600
I don't like myself very much anyway.

1023
01:27:43,480 --> 01:27:45,789
Pick up the cards. Let's go.

1024
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:48,878
- Do I have to?
- You bet. I got a terrific hand.

1025
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:58,113
- You really wanna discard that?
- Sure.

1026
01:27:58,240 --> 01:27:59,992
Gin.

1027
01:28:04,160 --> 01:28:08,915
10, 20, 40, 52 and 25... 77.

1028
01:28:09,640 --> 01:28:12,950
Spades are double... 154.

1029
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:19,876
Blitzed. Two games.

1030
01:29:46,360 --> 01:29:49,511
All right, all right, Mrs. Dreyfuss.

1031
01:29:56,720 --> 01:29:58,472
- Hi, Baxter.
- What do <i>you</i> want?

1032
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:00,556
What do I want? Just a minute.

1033
01:30:00,680 --> 01:30:03,240
- You can't come in!
- What's the matter with you?

1034
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:05,351
I made a reservation for four o'clock.

1035
01:30:05,480 --> 01:30:07,710
You can't stay.
Take your champagne and go.

1036
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:11,230
I don't wanna pull rank on you,
but I told the little lady it was all set.

1037
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:14,909
Are you gonna leave, Mr. Kirkeby,
or do I have to throw you out?

1038
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:18,479
Buddy-boy,
why didn't you say so?

1039
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:21,831
- Got yourself a little playmate, huh?
- Now will you get out?

1040
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:30,471
Hey, come on! What are we waiting for?
Open up, will you?

1041
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:32,556
Mildred!

1042
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:38,358
- What's holding things up?
- Say, let's have a party, the four of us.

1043
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:40,436
No!

1044
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:46,710
Well, I don't blame you.

1045
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:49,718
So you hit the jackpot, eh, kid?
I mean Kubelikwise.

1046
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:52,195
Don't worry.
I won't say a word to anybody.

1047
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:54,516
Stay with it, Buddy-boy.

1048
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:10,956
Who was that?

1049
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:14,996
Just somebody delivering
a bottle of champagne. Like some?

1050
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:18,400
Would you mind opening that window?

1051
01:31:21,080 --> 01:31:26,200
- Now don't get any ideas, Miss Kubelik.
- I just want some fresh air.

1052
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:29,551
It's only one story down.
The best you could do is break a leg.

1053
01:31:29,680 --> 01:31:32,274
So they'll shoot me, like a horse.

1054
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:35,831
Please, you gotta promise me
you won't do anything foolish.

1055
01:31:35,960 --> 01:31:38,315
- Who'd care?
- <i>I</i> would.

1056
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:47,594
Why can't I ever fall in love
with somebody nice like you?

1057
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:50,436
Yeah. Well...

1058
01:31:51,080 --> 01:31:53,913
That's the way it crumbles, cookiewise.

1059
01:31:55,240 --> 01:31:57,595
Go to sleep.

1060
01:32:30,360 --> 01:32:34,911
- Good morning, Mr. Sheldrake.
- Miss Olsen, come into my office, please.

1061
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:47,748
- Did you have a nice Christmas?
- Lovely. You were a great help!

1062
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:50,440
Your pep talk to Miss Kubelik
at the office party.

1063
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:54,997
- Sorry, Jeff. I never could hold my liquor.
- I thought you could hold your tongue.

1064
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:57,554
- It won't happen again.
- You bet it won't.

1065
01:32:57,680 --> 01:33:00,513
I'll arrange for you to get
a month's severance pay.

1066
01:33:00,640 --> 01:33:03,518
That's right, Miss Olsen.
I'm letting you go.

1067
01:33:04,240 --> 01:33:06,708
You let me go four years ago, Jeff.

1068
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:11,072
And were cruel enough to make me sit out
there and watch the new models pass by.

1069
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:14,237
I'd appreciate it if you'd be
out of here as soon as you can.

1070
01:33:14,360 --> 01:33:16,316
Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.

1071
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:28,799
Operator, this is Mr. Sheldrake. I'd like
Mr. Baxter's home telephone number.

1072
01:33:28,920 --> 01:33:31,673
He's in Ordinary Premium Accounting.

1073
01:33:46,440 --> 01:33:49,876
- <i>Hello?</i>
- <i>Hello. Jeff Sheldrake. Can you talk?</i>

1074
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:52,352
Yes. She's in the shower.

1075
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:55,074
- She's coming along fine, considering.
- Good.

1076
01:33:55,200 --> 01:33:58,715
- Is there anything you need? Money?
- No, thank you, Mr. Sheldrake.

1077
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:01,877
As a matter of fact, I have
some money for you. $100.

1078
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,353
Oh.

1079
01:34:03,480 --> 01:34:07,155
- If there's anything I can do for you...
- For me? I don't think so.

1080
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:09,919
But I was hoping maybe
you could do something for <i>her</i>.

1081
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:13,431
Like what? Put yourself
in my place, Baxter.

1082
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:15,676
How can I help her? My hands are tied.

1083
01:34:16,920 --> 01:34:19,275
Well... at least you can talk to her.

1084
01:34:20,360 --> 01:34:23,796
Let me put her on. And please, be gentle.

1085
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:26,869
There's a call for you!

1086
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,355
- For me?
- Yeah. Mr. Sheldrake.

1087
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:33,196
I don't wanna talk to him.

1088
01:34:33,320 --> 01:34:35,197
I think you should.

1089
01:34:35,320 --> 01:34:40,440
I gotta run down to the grocery anyway.
There's nothing left here but frozen pizza.

1090
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:43,196
I'll be right back. OK?

1091
01:35:02,840 --> 01:35:04,796
Hello, Jeff.

1092
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:09,237
- Yes, I'm all right.
- Why did you do it, Fran?

1093
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:11,749
It's so childish,
and it never solves anything.

1094
01:35:11,880 --> 01:35:14,440
I oughta be very angry with you,
scaring me that way.

1095
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:19,156
But let's forget the whole thing, pretend
it never happened. What do you say?

1096
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:21,236
Fran?

1097
01:35:21,680 --> 01:35:24,114
<i>Are you there, Fran?</i>

1098
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:29,872
Of course I'm not here, because
the whole thing never happened.

1099
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:33,709
I never took those pills,
I never loved you...

1100
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:35,990
...we never even met.

1101
01:35:37,120 --> 01:35:40,999
- Isn't that the way you want it, Jeff?
- You know I didn't mean it that way.

1102
01:35:41,120 --> 01:35:43,839
You just get well.
Do what the nurse says. I mean Baxter.

1103
01:35:43,960 --> 01:35:46,918
I'll see you as soon as I can.
Goodbye, Fran.

1104
01:36:04,520 --> 01:36:06,988
Hello, Mrs. Sheldrake. This is Miss Olsen.

1105
01:36:07,120 --> 01:36:11,113
Fine, thank you. I was wondering
if we could have lunch together.

1106
01:36:11,960 --> 01:36:15,509
I don't know how important it is,
but you might find it educational.

1107
01:36:15,640 --> 01:36:18,234
It concerns your husband.

1108
01:36:18,360 --> 01:36:21,909
All right. One o'clock,
Longchamps, Madison and 59th.

1109
01:36:27,960 --> 01:36:30,110
Don't worry. I'm on my way.

1110
01:36:30,240 --> 01:36:32,196
Just making a personal call.

1111
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:35,796
Here's a dime.

1112
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:39,959
Going down.

1113
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:54,354
Oh, Mr. Baxter! I'm glad you're here.

1114
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:56,994
- I was just going to get the passkey.
- What for?

1115
01:36:57,120 --> 01:36:59,839
I thought I smelled gas
coming from your apartment.

1116
01:36:59,960 --> 01:37:01,916
Gas?!

1117
01:37:10,640 --> 01:37:12,596
Miss Kubelik?

1118
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:16,356
Miss Kubelik!

1119
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:20,916
- You all right?
- Sure!

1120
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:24,837
- What's that funny smell?
- Gas! Didn't you turn it on?

1121
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:27,838
Yes, to boil water to get
the coffee stains out of my dress.

1122
01:37:27,960 --> 01:37:31,236
- You turned it on but you didn't light it.
- Are you supposed to?

1123
01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:35,035
In this house you're supposed to.
Hey, what are you doing with that?

1124
01:37:35,160 --> 01:37:38,470
I was washing my stockings,
so I thought I'd wash your socks too.

1125
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:42,593
- Oh. Thank you.
- Very curious. I could only find 3<i>/</i> pair.

1126
01:37:42,720 --> 01:37:45,109
Things are a little disorganized
around here.

1127
01:37:45,240 --> 01:37:48,949
I'd say. What's a tennis racket
doing in the kitchen?

1128
01:37:49,080 --> 01:37:53,790
Tennis racket? Oh, I remember.
I was cooking myself an Italian dinner.

1129
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:56,559
I used it to strain the spaghetti.

1130
01:37:56,680 --> 01:37:59,148
- Why not?
- In fact, I'm a pretty good cook.

1131
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:01,953
- Only I'm a lousy housekeeper.
- Yes, you are.

1132
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:06,312
When I was straightening up the couch,
I found six hairpins, a lipstick...

1133
01:38:06,440 --> 01:38:09,955
...a pair of false eyelashes and
a swizzle stick from the Stork Club.

1134
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:13,277
It's just that I'm the kind of guy
who can't say no.

1135
01:38:13,400 --> 01:38:17,313
- I don't mean to girls. I mean...
- To someone like Mr. Sheldrake.

1136
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:20,398
- I guess so.
- I know so.

1137
01:38:22,040 --> 01:38:24,395
- He's a taker.
- What?

1138
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:27,110
Some people take, some people get took.

1139
01:38:27,240 --> 01:38:31,119
And they know they're gettin' took
and there's nothin' they can do about it.

1140
01:38:31,240 --> 01:38:33,196
I wouldn't say that.

1141
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:35,876
What would you like for dinner, huh?

1142
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:39,072
Hey. Onion soup, and canned asparagus...

1143
01:38:39,200 --> 01:38:41,156
I really should be getting home.

1144
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:44,158
- My family'll be flipping by now.
- You can't leave yet.

1145
01:38:44,280 --> 01:38:48,478
The doctor said it takes 48 hours
to get that stuff out of your system.

1146
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:53,638
How long does it take to get someone
you're stuck on out of your system?

1147
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:56,593
If only they'd invent
some kind of pump for that.

1148
01:38:56,720 --> 01:39:02,113
I know how you feel, Miss Kubelik. You
think it's the end of the world. But it's not.

1149
01:39:02,240 --> 01:39:04,708
I went through exactly
the same thing myself.

1150
01:39:04,840 --> 01:39:06,717
- You did?
- Well, not exactly the same.

1151
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:08,512
I tried to do it with a gun.

1152
01:39:08,640 --> 01:39:11,632
- Over a girl?
- Worse. It was the wife of my best friend.

1153
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:16,595
And I was mad about her. But I knew
it was hopeless and I decided to end it all.

1154
01:39:16,720 --> 01:39:20,679
I went to a pawnshop and I bought a .45
automatic and I drove up to Eden Park...

1155
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:22,836
- Do you know Cincinnati?
- No, I don't.

1156
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:25,520
Anyway, I parked the car
and I loaded that gun...

1157
01:39:25,640 --> 01:39:29,838
You read in the papers that people shoot
themselves. Believe me, it's not that easy.

1158
01:39:29,960 --> 01:39:33,430
I mean, how do you do it?
Here? Here? Here?

1159
01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:37,320
- Know where I finally shot myself?
- Where?

1160
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:39,271
- Here.
- In the knee?!

1161
01:39:39,400 --> 01:39:41,834
Yeah! I was sittin' there, tryin' to decide.

1162
01:39:41,960 --> 01:39:44,235
A cop came up because
I was illegally parked.

1163
01:39:44,360 --> 01:39:47,591
I tried to hide the gun
under the seat and it went off.

1164
01:39:47,720 --> 01:39:51,235
- That's terrible!
- It was a year till I could bend the knee.

1165
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:54,352
But I got over the girl in three weeks.

1166
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:59,469
Still lives in Cincinnati.
Has four kids and gained 20 pounds.

1167
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:01,909
Sends me a fruitcake every Christmas.

1168
01:40:02,040 --> 01:40:04,395
Are you just making this up
to make me feel better?

1169
01:40:04,520 --> 01:40:06,476
Of course not! Here's the fruitcake.

1170
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:08,716
- Do you wanna see my knee?
- No, thank you.

1171
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:11,991
The fellas in the office might
get the wrong idea how I found out.

1172
01:40:12,120 --> 01:40:16,079
Let 'em! Look, I'm gonna cook dinner
for us. We'll have fruitcake for dessert.

1173
01:40:16,200 --> 01:40:19,317
You just sit there and rest.
You've done enough for today.

1174
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:22,557
Yes, Nurse.

1175
01:40:36,120 --> 01:40:39,237
- Can I help you?
- I'm lookin' for Miss Kubelik.

1176
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:44,354
- So am I. She didn't report this morning.
- She didn't? Who's in charge here?

1177
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:48,678
That comes under General Office
Administration. Mr. Dobisch, 21st floor.

1178
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:50,472
Thanks.

1179
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:57,192
So I take Sylvia up to the apartment, and
guess who he's stashed in the bedroom.

1180
01:40:57,320 --> 01:40:58,548
- Who?
- Kubelik.

1181
01:40:58,680 --> 01:41:01,672
No kiddin'? Buddy-boy and Kubelik
having a little toot?

1182
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:06,112
Toot? More like a lost weekend.
Neither of 'em showed up for work today.

1183
01:41:06,240 --> 01:41:07,832
AWOL, hm?

1184
01:41:07,960 --> 01:41:10,428
What gripes me is
they guzzled my champagne...

1185
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:13,950
...while Sylvia and I wound up
at the Guggenheim Museum.

1186
01:41:15,560 --> 01:41:17,516
- Mr. Dobisch?
- Yeah.

1187
01:41:18,520 --> 01:41:22,559
I'm Karl Matuschka. My sister-in-law
runs one of the elevators. Fran Kubelik.

1188
01:41:22,680 --> 01:41:24,113
- Miss Kubelik?
- You know her?

1189
01:41:24,240 --> 01:41:27,949
Of course. We have a lot of employees,
but we're one big, happy family.

1190
01:41:28,080 --> 01:41:32,995
She lives with us, and my wife's nervous
cos Fran hasn't been home for two days.

1191
01:41:33,120 --> 01:41:34,439
That so?

1192
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:37,518
So we wondered if somebody here
knew what happened to her.

1193
01:41:37,640 --> 01:41:39,039
I see.

1194
01:41:39,160 --> 01:41:42,630
What do you think, Al?
Can we help the man?

1195
01:41:42,760 --> 01:41:46,036
Why not? We don't owe
Buddy-boy anything.

1196
01:41:46,160 --> 01:41:49,516
Yeah. What's Buddy-boy
done for us lately?

1197
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:53,875
Who is Buddy-boy?

1198
01:42:17,080 --> 01:42:20,789
- Are we dressing for dinner?
- No. Just come as you are.

1199
01:42:20,920 --> 01:42:24,879
- You're pretty good with that racket.
- You should see my backhand.

1200
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:29,718
Wait till you see me serve the meatballs.

1201
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:33,753
- Shall I light the candles?
- It's a must, gracious livingwise.

1202
01:42:52,040 --> 01:42:54,918
- You bought some napkins.
- Might as well go all the way.

1203
01:42:58,200 --> 01:43:00,509
You know, I used to live
like Robinson Crusoe.

1204
01:43:00,640 --> 01:43:02,790
Shipwrecked, among eight million people.

1205
01:43:02,920 --> 01:43:05,957
And then one day I saw
a footprint in the sand...

1206
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:08,036
...and there you were.

1207
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:11,070
It's a wonderful thing, dinner for two.

1208
01:43:11,200 --> 01:43:14,909
- Do you usually eat alone?
- No. Sometimes I eat with Ed Sullivan.

1209
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:17,759
Or sometimes Dinah Shore
or Perry Como.

1210
01:43:17,880 --> 01:43:21,714
The other night it was Mae West.
She was much younger then. Cheers.

1211
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:24,559
- Cheers.
- Know what we're gonna do after dinner?

1212
01:43:24,720 --> 01:43:26,711
- The dishes.
- I mean after that.

1213
01:43:26,840 --> 01:43:29,035
- What?
- You don't have to if you don't want to.

1214
01:43:29,160 --> 01:43:31,469
- Oh, I don't?
- We're gonna finish the gin game.

1215
01:43:31,600 --> 01:43:34,160
So keep a clear head.

1216
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:38,839
Cos I don't wanna take advantage of you,
the way I did yesterday in bed.

1217
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:40,996
- Baxter?
- Yes.

1218
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:52,354
What's with you, Fran?
Did you forget where you live?

1219
01:43:52,480 --> 01:43:56,029
- My brother-in-law, Karl Matuschka.
- Oh! How do you do, Mr. Matusch...

1220
01:43:56,160 --> 01:44:00,392
- Get dressed. I got the cab downstairs.
- Wait. I know what you're thinking, but...

1221
01:44:00,520 --> 01:44:03,193
It's none of my business
what you do. You're over 21.

1222
01:44:03,320 --> 01:44:06,790
- But your sister thinks you're a lady.
- All we were gonna do was eat!

1223
01:44:06,920 --> 01:44:09,309
If there wasn't a lady present,
I'd clobber you.

1224
01:44:09,440 --> 01:44:12,193
All right, Karl! I'll get dressed.

1225
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:22,996
Want a martini?

1226
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:30,549
How about some spaghetti
with meat sauce that I cooked myself?

1227
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:38,513
Your sister-in-law sure is terrific.

1228
01:44:41,640 --> 01:44:45,997
It must be murder drivin' a cab
in New York with the cross-town traffic.

1229
01:44:50,280 --> 01:44:52,236
Hi, Baxter. How's the patient?

1230
01:44:52,360 --> 01:44:54,271
Oh, uh... I'm fine, Doc.

1231
01:44:54,400 --> 01:44:56,356
Not you. Miss Kubelik.

1232
01:44:57,080 --> 01:45:01,835
- What's the matter with Miss Kubelik?
- This is Mr. Matuschka. He's... got a cab.

1233
01:45:01,960 --> 01:45:04,315
- Fran been sick?
- No. Just a little accident.

1234
01:45:04,440 --> 01:45:08,228
- What does he mean, accident?
- Well... these things happen all the time.

1235
01:45:08,360 --> 01:45:10,430
What things? What kind
of a doctor are you?

1236
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:13,632
Not that kind! He just gave her
a shot, pumped out her stomach.

1237
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:16,832
- What for?
- I took sleeping pills. But I'm fine now.

1238
01:45:16,960 --> 01:45:19,428
- Why'd you take sleeping pills?
- On account of me.

1239
01:45:19,560 --> 01:45:21,516
You?

1240
01:45:21,640 --> 01:45:23,358
Who else?

1241
01:45:28,040 --> 01:45:29,996
Leave him alone!

1242
01:45:32,280 --> 01:45:35,431
Oh, you fool. You damn fool.

1243
01:45:37,480 --> 01:45:40,438
- Come on, Fran.
- Goodbye, Mr. Baxter.

1244
01:45:46,160 --> 01:45:48,116
Goodbye, Doctor.

1245
01:45:49,960 --> 01:45:54,511
Well, I don't wanna gloat, but
just between us, you had it coming to you.

1246
01:45:56,720 --> 01:45:59,518
You're gonna have a shiner tomorrow.

1247
01:45:59,640 --> 01:46:01,392
Let me get my bag.

1248
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:05,396
Don't bother, Doc.

1249
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:07,476
It doesn't hurt a bit.

1250
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:30,630
Mr. Sheldrake's office? This is CC Baxter.

1251
01:46:30,760 --> 01:46:33,877
Please tell him I'd like to
come up and see him. It's important.

1252
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:35,956
Will you call me back, please?

1253
01:46:38,640 --> 01:46:41,552
Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you.

1254
01:46:42,720 --> 01:46:44,676
All your troubles are over.

1255
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:48,559
I'm gonna take Miss Kubelik
off your hands.

1256
01:46:49,360 --> 01:46:51,715
The plain fact is, I love her.

1257
01:46:52,600 --> 01:46:55,068
I thought you should be the first to know.

1258
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:57,998
After all, you don't really
want her, and I do.

1259
01:46:58,120 --> 01:47:02,079
And though it may sound presumptuous,
she needs somebody like me.

1260
01:47:02,200 --> 01:47:05,510
So I think it would be best all around.

1261
01:47:05,640 --> 01:47:07,039
Solutionwise.

1262
01:47:07,160 --> 01:47:08,388
Yes?

1263
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:10,590
I'll be right up.

1264
01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:13,951
Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you.

1265
01:47:14,080 --> 01:47:16,036
All your troubles are over.

1266
01:47:20,160 --> 01:47:22,310
19.

1267
01:47:22,440 --> 01:47:25,989
- Hi, Buddy-boy. What happened to you?
- Hit by a swinging door?

1268
01:47:26,120 --> 01:47:28,918
- Or a yellow cab?
- That guy really must've belted him.

1269
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:32,112
Yeah. He's punchy. Talking to himself.

1270
01:47:32,360 --> 01:47:33,679
27.

1271
01:47:33,800 --> 01:47:36,155
Those two days
she spent in the apartment...

1272
01:47:36,280 --> 01:47:39,158
...made me realize
how lonely I'd been before.

1273
01:47:39,280 --> 01:47:42,670
But, thanks to you, I'm
in a financial position to marry her.

1274
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:45,712
If I can ever square things with her family.

1275
01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:48,149
Good morning. CC Baxter.

1276
01:47:51,960 --> 01:47:53,916
- <i>Mr. Baxter is here.</i>
- Send him in.

1277
01:47:56,080 --> 01:47:58,878
Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you.

1278
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,036
And I've got good news for <i>you</i>, Baxter.

1279
01:48:01,160 --> 01:48:03,355
- All your troubles are over.
- Sir?

1280
01:48:03,680 --> 01:48:06,752
I know how worried you were
about Miss Kubelik. Stop worrying.

1281
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:09,633
I'm going to take her off your hands.

1282
01:48:09,760 --> 01:48:12,558
- You're gonna take her off <i>my</i> hands?
- That's right.

1283
01:48:12,680 --> 01:48:15,035
I've moved out of the house.

1284
01:48:15,960 --> 01:48:18,838
I'm gonna be staying in town,
at the Athletic Club.

1285
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:21,838
- You left your wife.
- If you must know, I fired my secretary.

1286
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:26,590
My secretary got to my wife, and my wife
fired me. Ain't that a kick in the head?

1287
01:48:26,720 --> 01:48:28,199
Yeah.

1288
01:48:28,320 --> 01:48:30,151
Now what's your news, Baxter?

1289
01:48:32,240 --> 01:48:35,835
It's about Miss Kubelik. She's feeling
all right again so she went home.

1290
01:48:35,960 --> 01:48:38,918
Swell. And don't think
I've forgotten what you did for me.

1291
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:40,996
This way, Baxter.

1292
01:48:44,280 --> 01:48:46,555
Sit down. Try it on for size.

1293
01:48:47,560 --> 01:48:49,994
- You like? It's all yours.
- Mine?

1294
01:48:50,120 --> 01:48:55,114
My assistant has been shifted to the
Denver office and you're taking his place.

1295
01:48:55,240 --> 01:48:57,595
What's the matter?
You don't seem very excited.

1296
01:48:57,720 --> 01:49:01,793
Well, it's just that so many things
have been happening so fast.

1297
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:04,593
I'm very pleased.
Especially for Miss Kubelik.

1298
01:49:04,720 --> 01:49:09,510
I think she's the kind of girl that definitely
ought to be married to... someone.

1299
01:49:09,640 --> 01:49:14,919
Sure, sure. But first the property has to be
settled. Then it takes six weeks in Reno.

1300
01:49:15,040 --> 01:49:17,838
Meanwhile I'm going to enjoy
being a bachelor for a while.

1301
01:49:17,960 --> 01:49:21,270
Oh, Baxter, you now can have lunch
in the executive dining room.

1302
01:49:21,400 --> 01:49:23,960
That's one of the privileges
that goes with this job.

1303
01:49:24,080 --> 01:49:28,517
You also get a nice little expense account,
use of the executive washroom...

1304
01:49:28,640 --> 01:49:30,949
Say, what happened to you, Baxter?

1305
01:49:31,080 --> 01:49:33,674
- I got kicked in the head too.
- Oh?

1306
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:55,956
Good evening, Mr. Baxter.

1307
01:49:56,080 --> 01:49:57,513
Oh.

1308
01:49:57,640 --> 01:50:00,313
Miss Kubelik. How are you feeling?

1309
01:50:00,440 --> 01:50:03,034
- I feel fine. How's your eye?
- Oh, fine.

1310
01:50:03,160 --> 01:50:05,879
- How are things at the apartment?
- Nothing's changed.

1311
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,833
- We never did finish that gin game.
- I know.

1312
01:50:10,480 --> 01:50:12,755
I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake.

1313
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:15,348
Leaving his wife? Yeah.
I'm very happy for you.

1314
01:50:15,480 --> 01:50:17,948
- I never thought he'd do it.
- I told you all along.

1315
01:50:18,080 --> 01:50:21,470
- You were wrong about Mr. Sheldrake.
- I guess so.

1316
01:50:21,600 --> 01:50:23,556
You were wrong about me too.

1317
01:50:23,680 --> 01:50:26,717
What you said about those who take
and those who get took.

1318
01:50:26,840 --> 01:50:29,912
Mr. Sheldrake wasn't using me.
I was using <i>him</i>. See?

1319
01:50:30,040 --> 01:50:34,352
Last month I was at desk 861 on
the 19th floor. Now I'm on the 27th floor.

1320
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:36,436
A paneled office, three windows.

1321
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:39,472
So it all worked out fine.
We're both getting what we wanted.

1322
01:50:39,600 --> 01:50:42,398
Yes. Will you walk me to the subway?

1323
01:50:42,520 --> 01:50:47,958
No, thank you. Well, I... To tell you the
truth, I have this heavy date for tonight.

1324
01:50:51,320 --> 01:50:54,551
- Aren't you meeting Mr. Sheldrake?
- No. You know how people talk.

1325
01:50:54,680 --> 01:50:59,754
I decided it was best not to see each other
until everything was settled, divorcewise.

1326
01:50:59,880 --> 01:51:01,836
That's very wise.

1327
01:51:02,920 --> 01:51:05,275
- Good night, Mr. Baxter.
- Good night.

1328
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:43,071
- Baxter, could you step in here a minute?
- <i>Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.</i>

1329
01:51:43,200 --> 01:51:45,156
- There you are.
- Much obliged.

1330
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:52,557
Here are the figures on staff turnover. 37%
of females leave to get married and 22%...

1331
01:51:52,680 --> 01:51:55,513
Baxter, you work too hard.
It's New Year's Eve. Relax!

1332
01:51:55,640 --> 01:51:58,518
- Yes, sir.
- I suppose you'll be celebrating tonight.

1333
01:51:58,640 --> 01:52:00,676
- Naturally.
- I'm taking Miss Kubelik out.

1334
01:52:00,840 --> 01:52:02,831
- I finally talked her into it.
- I see.

1335
01:52:02,960 --> 01:52:07,158
The only thing is, I'm staying at the
Athletic Club and it's strictly stag, so...

1336
01:52:07,280 --> 01:52:09,316
If you don't mind?

1337
01:52:10,080 --> 01:52:13,470
- Don't mind what?
- You know my key to your apartment?

1338
01:52:13,600 --> 01:52:16,717
When we had that little scare
about Miss Kubelik...

1339
01:52:16,840 --> 01:52:20,674
...I threw it out the window of the train.
- Very clever.

1340
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:22,995
So now I'll have to borrow your key.

1341
01:52:24,440 --> 01:52:27,159
- Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake.
- What do you mean, sorry?

1342
01:52:27,280 --> 01:52:29,589
You're not bringing anybody
to my apartment.

1343
01:52:29,720 --> 01:52:33,918
- It's not just anybody. It's Miss Kubelik.
- Especially not Miss Kubelik.

1344
01:52:34,040 --> 01:52:37,112
- How's that again?
- No key.

1345
01:52:38,920 --> 01:52:43,357
Baxter, I picked you for my team because
I thought you were a bright young man.

1346
01:52:43,480 --> 01:52:46,790
Do you realize what you're doing?
Not to me, but to yourself?

1347
01:52:46,920 --> 01:52:50,151
Normally it takes years
to work your way up to the 27th floor.

1348
01:52:50,280 --> 01:52:53,192
But it only takes 30 seconds
to be out on the street again.

1349
01:52:53,320 --> 01:52:55,788
- You dig?
- I dig.

1350
01:52:56,920 --> 01:52:58,876
So what's it going to be?

1351
01:53:05,400 --> 01:53:08,358
- Now you're being bright.
- Thank you, sir.

1352
01:53:25,080 --> 01:53:27,674
- Baxter, you gave me the wrong key.
- No, I didn't.

1353
01:53:27,800 --> 01:53:30,360
But this is the key
to the executive washroom.

1354
01:53:30,480 --> 01:53:34,109
That's right. I won't be needing it
because I'm all washed up around here.

1355
01:53:34,240 --> 01:53:37,516
- What's gotten into you?
- Just following doctor's orders.

1356
01:53:37,640 --> 01:53:41,713
I've decided to become a <i>mensch</i>.
Know what that means? A human being.

1357
01:53:41,840 --> 01:53:45,628
- Now hold on, Baxter.
- The old payola won't work anymore.

1358
01:53:45,760 --> 01:53:47,716
Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.

1359
01:54:21,880 --> 01:54:25,668
- We're having a party and ran out of ice.
- Sure, Doc.

1360
01:54:25,800 --> 01:54:27,836
How come you're alone
on New Year's Eve?

1361
01:54:27,960 --> 01:54:29,837
Well, I got things to do.

1362
01:54:29,960 --> 01:54:33,999
- What's this? You're packing?
- Yeah. I'm giving up the apartment.

1363
01:54:34,120 --> 01:54:35,917
Where are you moving to?

1364
01:54:36,040 --> 01:54:38,952
I don't know. All I know is
I gotta get outta this place.

1365
01:54:39,080 --> 01:54:41,036
Sorry to lose you, Baxter.

1366
01:54:41,160 --> 01:54:45,711
Me? Oh, my body. Don't worry, it'll go to
the university, Doc. I'll put it in writing.

1367
01:54:45,840 --> 01:54:48,912
- Could you use some champagne?
- Booze we don't need.

1368
01:54:49,040 --> 01:54:50,792
Say, why don't you join us?

1369
01:54:50,920 --> 01:54:55,710
We got two brain surgeons, a proctologist
and three nurses from Bellevue.

1370
01:54:55,840 --> 01:54:57,717
No, thanks. I don't feel like it.

1371
01:54:57,840 --> 01:55:01,913
In case I don't see you again, how much
do I owe you for taking care of that girl?

1372
01:55:02,040 --> 01:55:05,749
Forget it. I didn't do it as a doctor.
I did it as a neighbor.

1373
01:55:05,880 --> 01:55:08,440
By the way, whatever happened to her?

1374
01:55:09,680 --> 01:55:12,558
You know me with girls.
Easy come, easy go.

1375
01:55:12,680 --> 01:55:15,240
- Goodbye, Doc.
- Happy New Year.

1376
01:55:56,800 --> 01:55:59,155
Sorry I took so long
on the phone. We're all set.

1377
01:55:59,280 --> 01:56:01,589
- For what?
- I rented a car. It'll be here at one.

1378
01:56:01,720 --> 01:56:04,473
- We're driving to Atlantic City.
- Atlantic City?

1379
01:56:04,600 --> 01:56:08,957
I know it's a drag, but you can't find
a hotel room in town on New Year's Eve.

1380
01:56:09,960 --> 01:56:12,713
Ring out the old year, ring in the new.

1381
01:56:12,840 --> 01:56:14,956
Ring-a-ding-ding.

1382
01:56:15,440 --> 01:56:18,671
I didn't plan it this way. It's Baxter's fault.

1383
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:19,755
Baxter?

1384
01:56:19,880 --> 01:56:23,270
He wouldn't give me
the key to the apartment.

1385
01:56:23,400 --> 01:56:25,868
- He wouldn't?
- No. He just walked out on me. Quit.

1386
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,912
Threw that big, fat job right in my face.

1387
01:56:30,280 --> 01:56:34,193
- The nerve.
- The little punk. After all I did for him.

1388
01:56:34,320 --> 01:56:38,518
Said I couldn't bring anybody to the
apartment, especially not Miss Kubelik.

1389
01:56:38,640 --> 01:56:41,313
What's he got against you, anyway?

1390
01:56:41,440 --> 01:56:47,072
I don't know. I guess that's the way
it crumbles, cookiewise.

1391
01:56:49,040 --> 01:56:51,395
What are you talking about?

1392
01:56:52,360 --> 01:56:55,636
I'd spell it out for you, only I can't spell.

1393
01:57:11,440 --> 01:57:13,396
Happy New Year, Fran.

1394
01:57:52,280 --> 01:57:54,236
Fran?

1395
01:57:55,480 --> 01:57:57,436
Where are you, Fran?

1396
01:58:14,840 --> 01:58:16,796
Mr. Baxter!

1397
01:58:17,080 --> 01:58:18,195
Mr. Baxter!

1398
01:58:18,560 --> 01:58:21,438
Mr. Baxter! Mr. Baxter!

1399
01:58:24,320 --> 01:58:25,594
Oh!

1400
01:58:25,720 --> 01:58:28,712
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

1401
01:58:28,840 --> 01:58:31,195
Are you sure? How's your knee?

1402
01:58:31,920 --> 01:58:33,876
I'm fine all over.

1403
01:58:35,840 --> 01:58:39,116
- Mind if I come in?
- Of course not.

1404
01:58:42,720 --> 01:58:44,676
Let me get another glass.

1405
01:58:47,520 --> 01:58:49,556
- Where are you going?
- Who knows?

1406
01:58:49,680 --> 01:58:52,877
Another neighborhood,
another town, another job.

1407
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,230
I'm on my own.

1408
01:58:55,360 --> 01:58:57,316
That's funny. So am I.

1409
01:58:58,480 --> 01:59:00,675
What'd you do with the cards?

1410
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:02,756
In there.

1411
01:59:13,640 --> 01:59:15,596
What about Mr. Sheldrake?

1412
01:59:15,720 --> 01:59:18,678
I'm gonna send him
a fruitcake every Christmas.

1413
01:59:21,040 --> 01:59:22,996
Cut.

1414
01:59:24,600 --> 01:59:26,556
I love you, Miss Kubelik.

1415
01:59:27,080 --> 01:59:28,832
Three.

1416
01:59:28,960 --> 01:59:30,109
Queen.

1417
01:59:30,240 --> 01:59:34,074
Did you hear what I said, Miss Kubelik?
I absolutely adore you.

1418
01:59:36,640 --> 01:59:38,596
Shut up and deal.

1419
01:59:52,960 --> 01:59:55,918
