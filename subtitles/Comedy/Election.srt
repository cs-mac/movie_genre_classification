1
00:03:49,773 --> 00:03:51,191
Hey, Mr. McAllister.

2
00:03:51,233 --> 00:03:53,652
Not wasting any time,
are you, Tracy?

3
00:03:53,735 --> 00:03:57,406
You know what they say
about the early bird.

4
00:03:57,447 --> 00:03:58,865
Yeah, I do.

5
00:04:00,826 --> 00:04:02,327
Good luck there, Tracy.

6
00:04:02,411 --> 00:04:04,621
Thanks, Mr. M.
I'll see you in class.

7
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,126
None of this
would've happened

8
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:11,837
if Mr. McAllister hadn't
meddled the way he did.

9
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:14,214
He should've just accepted
things as they are,

10
00:04:14,256 --> 00:04:16,591
instead of trying
to interfere with destiny.

11
00:04:16,675 --> 00:04:19,511
You see, you can't
interfere with destiny.

12
00:04:19,553 --> 00:04:20,929
That's why it's destiny.

13
00:04:20,971 --> 00:04:22,848
And if you try to interfere,

14
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:25,267
the same thing's
just gonna happen anyway,

15
00:04:25,308 --> 00:04:26,685
and you'll just suffer.

16
00:04:29,146 --> 00:04:31,481
It's hard to remember
how the whole thing started,

17
00:04:31,523 --> 00:04:32,941
the whole election mess.

18
00:04:32,983 --> 00:04:36,194
What I do remember
is that I loved my job.

19
00:04:36,236 --> 00:04:37,696
I was a teacher,

20
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:38,739
an educator,

21
00:04:38,822 --> 00:04:41,491
and I couldn't imagine
doing anything else.

22
00:04:41,575 --> 00:04:43,201
Mr. McAllister.

23
00:04:43,243 --> 00:04:44,828
Mr. M!

24
00:04:44,911 --> 00:04:47,122
Quit day dreaming.
Get back to work.

25
00:04:47,247 --> 00:04:50,667
The students knew
it wasn't just a job for me.

26
00:04:50,751 --> 00:04:52,002
I got involved.

27
00:04:52,085 --> 00:04:53,920
Put down the cards, boys!

28
00:04:54,004 --> 00:04:55,380
This game is over!

29
00:04:55,464 --> 00:04:56,757
And I cared.

30
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,759
Come on, Wolverines!

31
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,718
Defense! Let's go!

32
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,636
And I think
I made a difference.

33
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,555
I knew I touched
the students' lives

34
00:05:03,638 --> 00:05:05,932
during their difficult
young adult years.

35
00:05:06,016 --> 00:05:09,811
And I took that
responsibility seriously.

36
00:05:09,895 --> 00:05:13,148
In the 12 years
I taught U.S. history,

37
00:05:13,231 --> 00:05:15,525
civics, and current events
at Carver,

38
00:05:15,609 --> 00:05:18,403
I was voted
Teacher of the Year 3 times.

39
00:05:18,487 --> 00:05:20,197
A school record.

40
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,200
Teaching was all
I'd ever wanted to do.

41
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,497
Standing in front of
a roomful of young people,

42
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,916
trying to get them excited
about the world,

43
00:05:30,999 --> 00:05:32,834
trying to make them think,

44
00:05:32,918 --> 00:05:36,171
preparing them for the tough
moral and ethical decisions

45
00:05:36,254 --> 00:05:38,090
that they'd face as adults,

46
00:05:38,173 --> 00:05:39,925
that's how I wanted
to spend my life.

47
00:05:40,967 --> 00:05:42,844
So is this
a moral situation

48
00:05:42,886 --> 00:05:44,971
or an ethical situation?

49
00:05:45,055 --> 00:05:47,849
What's the difference between
morals and ethics anyway?

50
00:05:47,933 --> 00:05:49,059
Anybody?

51
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,978
Derek.

52
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,897
Yeah. Ethics is
like when you do

53
00:05:53,939 --> 00:05:56,066
what society tells you
is right to do.

54
00:05:56,149 --> 00:05:57,234
And morals...

55
00:05:59,695 --> 00:06:01,571
Yeah, yeah,
you're on the right track.

56
00:06:01,613 --> 00:06:02,739
Can anybody help him out?

57
00:06:05,325 --> 00:06:06,284
Michelle.

58
00:06:06,368 --> 00:06:08,745
Morals are like...
lessons.

59
00:06:08,829 --> 00:06:10,831
You know, like
the moral of a story.

60
00:06:10,914 --> 00:06:14,501
It's what you learn
from a story or a fable.

61
00:06:14,584 --> 00:06:16,920
Or a life experience. Good.

62
00:06:16,962 --> 00:06:18,171
And ethics?

63
00:06:18,255 --> 00:06:21,717
Um, ethics is how
you use the morals

64
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,760
that you learn
from the story?

65
00:06:23,802 --> 00:06:27,097
Yeah, OK, but I think we're
missing something key here.

66
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,890
What are we missing?

67
00:06:36,565 --> 00:06:37,399
Tracy.

68
00:06:37,441 --> 00:06:39,609
Ethics are rules of conduct...

69
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:41,987
Tracy Flick.

70
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:42,946
Tracy Flick.

71
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,698
I'd seen a lot of
ambitious students

72
00:06:44,781 --> 00:06:46,158
come and go over the years,

73
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:49,494
but Tracy Flick,
she was a special case.

74
00:06:50,662 --> 00:06:52,372
Some people say
I'm an overachiever,

75
00:06:52,456 --> 00:06:53,832
but I think
they're just jealous.

76
00:06:53,915 --> 00:06:55,751
My mom always tells me
I'm different.

77
00:06:55,834 --> 00:06:57,169
You know, special.

78
00:06:57,252 --> 00:06:58,628
And if you look
at all the things

79
00:06:58,712 --> 00:06:59,588
I've accomplished so far,

80
00:06:59,671 --> 00:07:01,965
I think you'd have to agree.

81
00:07:08,305 --> 00:07:10,640
Here I am as Hodel in
FiddlerOn The Roof.

82
00:07:10,682 --> 00:07:13,518
Matchmaker, matchmaker,
I'll bring the veil

83
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,103
You bring the groom

84
00:07:15,187 --> 00:07:18,774
And here I am on KCHS,
our student-run TV station.

85
00:07:18,857 --> 00:07:20,692
The littering must stop.

86
00:07:20,776 --> 00:07:22,402
Tracy Flick reporting.

87
00:07:22,486 --> 00:07:24,529
But it was in the S.G.A.,

88
00:07:24,613 --> 00:07:25,989
the Student Government
Association,

89
00:07:26,073 --> 00:07:27,407
where I made my biggest mark.

90
00:07:27,491 --> 00:07:29,326
I never missed a single meeting.

91
00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:31,244
And I volunteered
for every committee,

92
00:07:31,328 --> 00:07:33,163
as long as I could lead it.

93
00:07:33,246 --> 00:07:34,289
I agree with Ashley!

94
00:07:34,373 --> 00:07:35,999
I think we should rent
the barrels ahead of time

95
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:37,959
because what happened
last time was a travesty.

96
00:07:38,043 --> 00:07:39,127
It was ridiculous,

97
00:07:39,211 --> 00:07:40,796
and I think it really
reflected poorly on all ofus.

98
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:43,173
Now Tracy Flick
was poised to win

99
00:07:43,256 --> 00:07:45,634
the presidency
ofthe student body.

100
00:07:45,717 --> 00:07:48,470
And so far,
she was running unopposed.

101
00:07:48,553 --> 00:07:51,348
Determined by a culture
at a certain time in history.

102
00:07:52,474 --> 00:07:54,267
Oh, there's
one more thing about Tracy

103
00:07:54,351 --> 00:07:55,894
I think you should know.

104
00:07:55,977 --> 00:07:59,898
Her pussy gets so wet
you can't believe it.

105
00:07:59,981 --> 00:08:01,817
Don't tell me that.

106
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,360
Don't tell me that.
I don't want to know that.

107
00:08:03,402 --> 00:08:05,278
A few months
before the election,

108
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,197
she'd gotten herself
in a little trouble

109
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,575
with my best friend
Dave Novotny.

110
00:08:10,659 --> 00:08:12,452
Foxy

111
00:08:12,536 --> 00:08:14,871
Dave came to Carver
the year after I did,

112
00:08:14,955 --> 00:08:16,790
and we hit it off right away.

113
00:08:16,873 --> 00:08:18,709
Dave was one of those guys
who taught

114
00:08:18,792 --> 00:08:20,127
because they never wanted
to leave high school

115
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:21,586
in the first place.

116
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:24,464
But basically, he was a good guy.

117
00:08:24,548 --> 00:08:26,842
Our wives became best friends, too.

118
00:08:26,925 --> 00:08:29,261
And when Dave and Linda's
son Darryl was born,

119
00:08:29,344 --> 00:08:31,638
they asked us to be
his godparents.

120
00:08:33,306 --> 00:08:35,642
You probably think the worst,

121
00:08:35,684 --> 00:08:38,353
that Mr. Novotny was
taking horrible advantage

122
00:08:38,395 --> 00:08:39,771
of one of his students.

123
00:08:39,813 --> 00:08:42,190
But it wasn't like that at all.

124
00:08:42,232 --> 00:08:44,568
Our relationship was
based on mutual respect

125
00:08:44,609 --> 00:08:45,652
and admiration.

126
00:08:45,736 --> 00:08:48,405
I mean, during my
sophomore year in geometry,

127
00:08:48,447 --> 00:08:50,323
it was strictly
professional between us.

128
00:08:50,365 --> 00:08:52,200
I mean, nothing.

129
00:08:52,284 --> 00:08:53,702
It wasn't until junior year

130
00:08:53,744 --> 00:08:55,620
when we worked together
on the year book

131
00:08:55,662 --> 00:08:57,539
that things got kind of serious.

132
00:08:57,581 --> 00:08:59,458
One night he took
us editors out to celebrate

133
00:08:59,499 --> 00:09:00,917
after a deadline.

134
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,295
Eventually, Dave and I
were left alone,

135
00:09:03,337 --> 00:09:04,755
and we got to talking.

136
00:09:04,796 --> 00:09:06,673
Not like teacher and student,

137
00:09:06,715 --> 00:09:08,091
but like 2 adults.

138
00:09:08,133 --> 00:09:09,551
You know, Tracy,

139
00:09:09,593 --> 00:09:11,470
I notice that
you don't seem to have

140
00:09:11,511 --> 00:09:13,388
any close friends at Carver.

141
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:15,307
You seem to be kind of a loner.

142
00:09:15,349 --> 00:09:18,018
No, I'm not.
I'm just real busy.

143
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,562
Oh, no. I know, I know
it's not by choice.

144
00:09:20,604 --> 00:09:22,981
I just mean that, that, well...

145
00:09:23,023 --> 00:09:25,400
being the kind of person you are,

146
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,319
it must be really difficult foryou

147
00:09:27,361 --> 00:09:29,071
to find somebody
you could talk to.

148
00:09:29,112 --> 00:09:30,655
What do you mean?

149
00:09:30,697 --> 00:09:33,033
What kind of person am I?

150
00:09:35,035 --> 00:09:38,830
Tracy, you know, I've been
watching you for going on...

151
00:09:38,872 --> 00:09:40,248
3 years now,

152
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:43,293
and I think you are
one of the most talented,

153
00:09:43,377 --> 00:09:46,421
hard-working,
sensitive, attractive,

154
00:09:46,505 --> 00:09:48,382
brilliant students I...

155
00:09:48,465 --> 00:09:49,383
No.

156
00:09:50,717 --> 00:09:52,969
Human beings I have ever met.

157
00:09:54,221 --> 00:09:55,180
Thank you.

158
00:09:55,263 --> 00:09:58,016
And I know that
sometimes people like you

159
00:09:58,058 --> 00:10:01,853
have to pay a price
for their greatness.

160
00:10:01,895 --> 00:10:04,439
And that price is loneliness.

161
00:10:04,439 --> 00:10:07,776
I don't know.
maybe I'm wrong, but...

162
00:10:07,818 --> 00:10:12,364
it just seems to me like
you might need a friend.

163
00:10:15,826 --> 00:10:17,536
Since I grew up
without a dad,

164
00:10:17,577 --> 00:10:18,995
you might assume, psychologically,

165
00:10:19,037 --> 00:10:21,039
I was looking
for a father figure.

166
00:10:21,081 --> 00:10:23,458
But that had nothing
to do with it at all.

167
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,377
It was just that
Dave was so strong,

168
00:10:25,419 --> 00:10:28,296
and he made me feel
so safe and protected.

169
00:10:28,338 --> 00:10:32,009
It was the first time
somebody ever saw the real me,

170
00:10:32,092 --> 00:10:33,927
the me that nobody else knows.

171
00:10:34,011 --> 00:10:36,930
OK, here. Get down. Get down.

172
00:10:45,981 --> 00:10:47,816
You're once

173
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:48,775
Twice

174
00:10:50,777 --> 00:10:55,032
Three times a lady

175
00:10:56,533 --> 00:11:02,205
And I love you

176
00:11:03,749 --> 00:11:06,043
Yes, you're once

177
00:11:06,126 --> 00:11:07,502
Twice

178
00:11:09,504 --> 00:11:11,340
Three times a lady

179
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:22,309
And I love you

180
00:11:24,311 --> 00:11:27,564
I love

181
00:11:27,647 --> 00:11:29,024
You

182
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,943
When I think back
on my relationship

183
00:11:31,985 --> 00:11:33,362
with Mr. Novotny,

184
00:11:33,403 --> 00:11:36,239
what I miss most is our talks.

185
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,577
You did it in your house?

186
00:11:40,619 --> 00:11:42,037
In your own house?

187
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,040
OK, I know it seems crazy, but...

188
00:11:45,082 --> 00:11:48,251
Jim, what I'm trying
to tell you is that...

189
00:11:48,293 --> 00:11:49,711
Tracy and I...

190
00:11:49,753 --> 00:11:52,089
are totally, totally...

191
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:54,091
in love.

192
00:11:55,258 --> 00:11:57,302
- In love?
- Yeah.

193
00:11:57,386 --> 00:11:58,428
It's serious.

194
00:11:58,512 --> 00:12:01,348
She inspires me in ways
that Linda never has.

195
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:03,392
She even wants to read my novel.

196
00:12:03,475 --> 00:12:05,477
But you haven't
written your novel.

197
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,937
That's the whole point!

198
00:12:06,978 --> 00:12:09,356
I... I've got the whole thing
right here!

199
00:12:09,398 --> 00:12:11,274
I just need
to get it out there.

200
00:12:11,316 --> 00:12:14,611
And Tracy wants me to write it
so she can read it.

201
00:12:14,653 --> 00:12:15,570
It's beautiful.

202
00:12:15,612 --> 00:12:17,030
Dave...

203
00:12:17,072 --> 00:12:20,367
I'm just saying this
as your friend.

204
00:12:20,409 --> 00:12:23,870
What you're doing is
really, really wrong,

205
00:12:23,912 --> 00:12:25,831
and you've gotta stop.

206
00:12:25,872 --> 00:12:27,833
The line you've crossed is...

207
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:29,751
It's immoral,
and it's illegal.

208
00:12:29,835 --> 00:12:31,169
Jim, come on.

209
00:12:31,253 --> 00:12:33,338
I don't need a lecture on ethics.

210
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,548
I'm not talking about ethics.

211
00:12:34,631 --> 00:12:36,091
I'm talking about morals.

212
00:12:37,676 --> 00:12:39,720
What's the difference?

213
00:12:39,761 --> 00:12:41,430
I guess
I don't have to tell you

214
00:12:41,513 --> 00:12:43,348
how this all turned out.

215
00:12:59,281 --> 00:13:01,116
Tracy's mom...

216
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:03,201
she doesn't understand.

217
00:13:03,243 --> 00:13:04,953
No. I'd say she doesn't.

218
00:13:05,037 --> 00:13:09,249
Fact is, I have never seen
a mother so upset.

219
00:13:10,417 --> 00:13:13,337
All right. I know what
Tracy told her mother,

220
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,005
what her mother told me.

221
00:13:15,088 --> 00:13:16,923
I need to hear this from you

222
00:13:17,007 --> 00:13:18,842
because I have
a legal responsibility here.

223
00:13:18,925 --> 00:13:20,719
Let me ask you this.

224
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,891
Did you cross the line
with this girl?

225
00:13:33,273 --> 00:13:34,149
I di...

226
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:36,526
W-We...

227
00:13:38,528 --> 00:13:40,364
We're in love.

228
00:13:44,785 --> 00:13:45,952
Your novel?!

229
00:13:46,036 --> 00:13:47,579
Are you fucking kidding me?

230
00:13:47,663 --> 00:13:48,538
Linda...

231
00:13:48,622 --> 00:13:49,998
After Dave got fired,

232
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,416
Linda kicked him out of the house

233
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,876
and filed for divorce.

234
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,754
He ended up
moving back to Milwaukee

235
00:13:55,837 --> 00:13:56,713
to live with his parents.

236
00:13:56,797 --> 00:13:57,964
He's lucky he's not in jail.

237
00:13:58,048 --> 00:13:59,466
Linda!

238
00:14:01,593 --> 00:14:03,637
And ethics are the basis of...

239
00:14:04,763 --> 00:14:06,640
OK. We'll pick up here next time.

240
00:14:11,937 --> 00:14:13,021
Would it be possible for me

241
00:14:13,105 --> 00:14:15,315
to retake the test
we took yesterday?

242
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:16,733
The test yesterday?
You wanna retake it?

243
00:14:16,817 --> 00:14:18,735
Yeah. I had to work
the night before,

244
00:14:18,819 --> 00:14:19,736
and I didn't have
enough time to study.

245
00:14:19,778 --> 00:14:20,696
Oh, yeah?

246
00:14:21,988 --> 00:14:23,865
Now that I have
more life experience,

247
00:14:23,907 --> 00:14:26,076
I feel sorry
for Mr. McAllister.

248
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:28,954
I mean, anyone who's stuck
in the same little room,

249
00:14:29,037 --> 00:14:30,747
wearing the same stupid clothes,

250
00:14:30,789 --> 00:14:33,625
same exact same things
year after year

251
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:35,043
for his whole life,

252
00:14:35,085 --> 00:14:37,462
while his students
go on to good colleges

253
00:14:37,504 --> 00:14:40,340
and move to big cities
and do great things

254
00:14:40,382 --> 00:14:43,176
and make loads of money,

255
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,137
he's gotta be at least
a little jealous.

256
00:14:45,178 --> 00:14:46,596
I noticed it was
a little low for you.

257
00:14:46,638 --> 00:14:47,973
It's like my mom says:

258
00:14:48,056 --> 00:14:51,393
The weak are always trying
to sabotage the strong.

259
00:14:51,435 --> 00:14:53,770
One thing that's important
to know about me

260
00:14:53,812 --> 00:14:55,230
is that I'm an only child,

261
00:14:55,272 --> 00:14:57,607
so my mom
is really devoted to me.

262
00:14:57,649 --> 00:14:59,067
And I love her so much.

263
00:14:59,109 --> 00:15:00,986
She wants me
to do all the things

264
00:15:01,028 --> 00:15:03,363
that she wanted to do
in life but couldn't.

265
00:15:03,405 --> 00:15:05,282
Mom used to be a stewardess
for Northwest,

266
00:15:05,323 --> 00:15:07,701
and now she works as a paralegal.

267
00:15:07,743 --> 00:15:09,619
She likes to write letters
to successful women

268
00:15:09,661 --> 00:15:11,538
like Elizabeth Dole
and Connie Chung

269
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,457
and ask them how they got
to be where they are

270
00:15:13,498 --> 00:15:15,292
and what advice
do they have for me,

271
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,336
Tracy, her daughter.

272
00:15:17,419 --> 00:15:18,670
9 times out of 10,

273
00:15:18,754 --> 00:15:20,589
they say you have
to hold onto your dreams

274
00:15:20,672 --> 00:15:21,548
no matter what.

275
00:15:21,631 --> 00:15:22,507
The pressures women face

276
00:15:22,591 --> 00:15:24,426
mean you have to work
twice as hard,

277
00:15:24,509 --> 00:15:27,763
and you can't let anything
or anyone stand in your way.

278
00:15:27,846 --> 00:15:29,222
Hey! Hey!

279
00:15:29,306 --> 00:15:31,350
One per person!
Put those back!

280
00:15:31,433 --> 00:15:32,809
Eat me.

281
00:15:32,851 --> 00:15:35,479
But you know,
winning isn't everything.

282
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:39,316
Win or lose, ethical conduct
is the most important thing.

283
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:40,942
Just ask Mr. McAllister.

284
00:15:41,026 --> 00:15:42,194
Mr. McAllister!

285
00:15:42,277 --> 00:15:44,946
Mr. McAllister, wait up!

286
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,490
Mr. McAllister, don't go!

287
00:15:49,451 --> 00:15:51,286
I got all my signatures.

288
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:53,705
There's 158, way more than I need.

289
00:15:53,789 --> 00:15:55,123
Hey, that's super.

290
00:15:55,207 --> 00:15:56,583
Here they are.

291
00:15:56,667 --> 00:15:58,001
Oh, you can just
put them in my box,

292
00:15:58,085 --> 00:15:59,795
and I'll take a look
at them tomorrow.

293
00:15:59,878 --> 00:16:01,380
Could you approve them now

294
00:16:01,463 --> 00:16:03,298
because I'd really like
to kick off my campaign

295
00:16:03,382 --> 00:16:05,217
right away, you know,
in the morning.

296
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,176
Right.

297
00:16:11,932 --> 00:16:14,768
Yeah, yeah.
Those look good to me.

298
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:16,687
Aren't you supposed to keep them?

299
00:16:16,728 --> 00:16:18,146
No. That's fiine.

300
00:16:18,188 --> 00:16:20,107
I thought you were
supposed to keep them.

301
00:16:22,484 --> 00:16:24,361
Yeah, right, fiine, OK.

302
00:16:24,403 --> 00:16:25,821
Thanks for everything.

303
00:16:25,862 --> 00:16:26,780
You bet.

304
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,536
I can't wait
to start campaigning.

305
00:16:32,577 --> 00:16:33,495
What's that?

306
00:16:33,537 --> 00:16:34,955
I can't wait
to start campaigning.

307
00:16:34,997 --> 00:16:36,873
Oh. Well, it should
be easy for you.

308
00:16:36,915 --> 00:16:38,291
So far, no competition.

309
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,210
Yeah, but you know,
Coca-Cola's by far

310
00:16:40,252 --> 00:16:41,169
the world's number one soft drink,

311
00:16:41,211 --> 00:16:43,088
and they spend
more money than anybody

312
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,172
on advertising.

313
00:16:44,214 --> 00:16:47,426
I guess that's how come
they stay number one.

314
00:16:47,467 --> 00:16:48,844
Yeah.

315
00:16:48,885 --> 00:16:51,263
OK. Well, good luck there, Tracy.

316
00:16:51,304 --> 00:16:54,349
You know, Mr. M...

317
00:16:54,433 --> 00:16:56,560
when I win the presidency,
that means you and I

318
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,770
are gonna be spending
a lot of time together,

319
00:16:58,812 --> 00:17:01,773
and I for one would really
like that time to be...

320
00:17:01,857 --> 00:17:04,901
harmonious and productive.

321
00:17:04,985 --> 00:17:06,611
Wouldn't you?

322
00:17:07,654 --> 00:17:08,530
Sure.

323
00:17:10,991 --> 00:17:11,992
OK.

324
00:17:12,075 --> 00:17:13,785
That's what I thought.
I was just checking.

325
00:17:13,827 --> 00:17:16,079
Yeah. Good luck there, Tracy.

326
00:17:16,163 --> 00:17:17,914
OK.

327
00:17:22,461 --> 00:17:25,255
I don't blame Tracy
for what happened with Dave.

328
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:26,631
How could I?

329
00:17:26,673 --> 00:17:28,884
Dave was an adult,
more than twice her age.

330
00:17:28,967 --> 00:17:31,970
Sure, she got on my nerves
once in a while,

331
00:17:32,054 --> 00:17:34,848
but I admired Tracy.
I really did.

332
00:17:36,391 --> 00:17:40,395
Thank God for Diane.
She was my best friend.

333
00:17:40,437 --> 00:17:42,522
My source of love and strength.

334
00:17:42,606 --> 00:17:44,441
Oh, sure, we'd had
our share of bumpy times,

335
00:17:44,524 --> 00:17:46,985
but we'd always seen them through.

336
00:17:47,069 --> 00:17:50,697
After 9 years of marriage,
we were closer than ever.

337
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,200
Anything wrong?

338
00:17:54,618 --> 00:17:55,994
No. No.

339
00:17:56,078 --> 00:17:57,996
Just, you know, school.

340
00:18:03,251 --> 00:18:05,504
When I win the presidency,

341
00:18:05,587 --> 00:18:08,840
we're gonna be spending
a lot of time together.

342
00:18:08,924 --> 00:18:12,719
Lots and lots and lots oftime.

343
00:18:12,761 --> 00:18:15,597
President and advisor.

344
00:18:15,681 --> 00:18:18,934
Harmonious and productive.

345
00:18:19,017 --> 00:18:21,812
Close and special.

346
00:18:21,895 --> 00:18:24,022
You... and I.

347
00:18:54,511 --> 00:18:55,887
Hey, P.J.

348
00:18:55,929 --> 00:18:57,806
What are you doing here
in the boys' locker room?

349
00:18:57,848 --> 00:18:59,307
I've come to see
the star quarterback

350
00:18:59,391 --> 00:19:00,642
before the big game.

351
00:19:00,726 --> 00:19:03,103
But what if Coach Henderson walks in?

352
00:19:03,145 --> 00:19:05,647
Oh, that's OK.
I took care of him.

353
00:19:05,731 --> 00:19:07,399
So, uh, what you reading?

354
00:19:07,441 --> 00:19:10,235
I'm just reviewing my playbook.

355
00:19:10,318 --> 00:19:12,654
I have a playwe can practice.

356
00:19:12,738 --> 00:19:14,156
You be quarterback.

357
00:19:14,197 --> 00:19:16,324
I'll be tight end.

358
00:19:26,668 --> 00:19:29,504
You know,
Coca-Cola is by far

359
00:19:29,546 --> 00:19:32,382
the world's number one soft drink.

360
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:41,933
Paul.

361
00:19:41,975 --> 00:19:42,893
Aah!

362
00:19:49,232 --> 00:19:51,234
Aah! Aaahhh!

363
00:19:51,276 --> 00:19:52,986
Aah!

364
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,946
I was so mad at God
when I broke my leg

365
00:19:54,988 --> 00:19:57,074
at Shadow Ridge over Christmas break.

366
00:19:57,157 --> 00:19:59,660
Why?!

367
00:19:59,743 --> 00:20:01,620
The doctors told me
I'd have to quit sports

368
00:20:01,703 --> 00:20:04,206
for at least a couple
ofyears, if not forever,

369
00:20:04,289 --> 00:20:05,916
which meant
no first-string quarterback

370
00:20:05,999 --> 00:20:07,334
in the fall.

371
00:20:07,417 --> 00:20:09,252
It was like the end of my life.

372
00:20:09,336 --> 00:20:12,130
When I got back to school,
everybody was so supportive,

373
00:20:12,214 --> 00:20:15,008
and they all wanted to sign
my cast and everything,

374
00:20:15,092 --> 00:20:17,219
but I still couldn't
shake the feeling

375
00:20:17,302 --> 00:20:19,346
that now my life had no purpose.

376
00:20:19,429 --> 00:20:21,264
What did God want from me?

377
00:20:21,348 --> 00:20:23,642
Why did I exist?

378
00:20:23,725 --> 00:20:26,520
Sometimes you can search
everywhere for answers.

379
00:20:26,603 --> 00:20:28,939
Then one day,
destiny just walks up

380
00:20:29,022 --> 00:20:30,857
and taps you on the shoulder.

381
00:20:30,941 --> 00:20:33,735
I know because it happened to me.

382
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:38,240
Paul, can I speak
to you for a minute?

383
00:20:38,281 --> 00:20:40,659
Mr. McAllister
changed my life.

384
00:20:40,701 --> 00:20:43,829
And no matter what they say
he did or did not do,

385
00:20:43,912 --> 00:20:46,206
I believe he is a good man.

386
00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:49,584
Paul, I know you've
been pretty down

387
00:20:49,668 --> 00:20:51,211
since your accident.

388
00:20:51,253 --> 00:20:54,589
Yeah. I wanted to play
football again so bad

389
00:20:54,631 --> 00:20:55,716
I could taste it,

390
00:20:55,757 --> 00:20:57,759
and maybe go on
to the playoffs and...

391
00:20:57,801 --> 00:20:58,719
I know.

392
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,970
I understand disappointment.

393
00:21:00,053 --> 00:21:00,971
I really do.

394
00:21:01,013 --> 00:21:01,930
Yeah.

395
00:21:01,972 --> 00:21:03,015
Now, I personally think

396
00:21:03,098 --> 00:21:04,933
you have a very bright
future ahead of you.

397
00:21:05,017 --> 00:21:06,309
And I'm not talking about

398
00:21:06,393 --> 00:21:08,353
the fleeting glory of sports.

399
00:21:08,395 --> 00:21:09,771
What do you mean?

400
00:21:09,813 --> 00:21:11,273
Let me give you a clue.

401
00:21:11,356 --> 00:21:13,025
You're a natural-born leader.

402
00:21:13,108 --> 00:21:15,902
You're one ofthe most
popular students at Carver.

403
00:21:15,986 --> 00:21:17,320
You're honest,
you're straight forward,

404
00:21:17,404 --> 00:21:18,989
and you don't crack under pressure,

405
00:21:19,072 --> 00:21:20,949
as we all saw in
an amazing fourth quarter

406
00:21:21,033 --> 00:21:22,576
against West side.

407
00:21:22,617 --> 00:21:24,536
All the kids look up to you.

408
00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:26,330
Now, what does that spell?

409
00:21:31,835 --> 00:21:33,170
Student...

410
00:21:33,253 --> 00:21:34,629
council...

411
00:21:34,713 --> 00:21:36,298
president.

412
00:21:36,381 --> 00:21:37,966
Who, me?

413
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:39,634
Oh, no. I...

414
00:21:39,718 --> 00:21:43,013
I don't know anything
about that stuff, Mr. M.

415
00:21:43,096 --> 00:21:45,182
I mean, besides,
that's Tracy Flick's thing.

416
00:21:45,265 --> 00:21:46,600
She's always working so hard.

417
00:21:46,683 --> 00:21:48,643
Yeah. She's a real
go-getter, all right.

418
00:21:48,685 --> 00:21:50,520
And she's super nice.

419
00:21:50,562 --> 00:21:51,897
Yeah, yeah,

420
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,815
but one person assured of victory

421
00:21:53,899 --> 00:21:55,734
kind of undermines the whole idea

422
00:21:55,817 --> 00:21:57,069
of democracy, don't you think?

423
00:21:57,152 --> 00:21:58,070
But, Mr. M...

424
00:21:58,153 --> 00:22:00,030
I mean, that'd be more
like a dictatorship

425
00:22:00,072 --> 00:22:01,448
like we studied.

426
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:02,407
But, Mr. M, there's...

427
00:22:02,449 --> 00:22:04,409
Paul, what's your favorite fruit?

428
00:22:04,493 --> 00:22:06,870
Pears.

429
00:22:06,953 --> 00:22:08,664
Pears. Good. OK.

430
00:22:08,705 --> 00:22:09,623
Let's say...

431
00:22:09,665 --> 00:22:11,625
Oh, no, wait.

432
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:13,043
Apples.

433
00:22:13,126 --> 00:22:14,419
Apples.

434
00:22:14,461 --> 00:22:15,420
Fine.

435
00:22:15,462 --> 00:22:18,757
Let's say all you
ever knew were apples.

436
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,635
Apples, apples, more apples.

437
00:22:21,677 --> 00:22:23,553
You might think apples
were pretty good,

438
00:22:23,595 --> 00:22:26,431
even if you got a rotten
one once in a while.

439
00:22:26,473 --> 00:22:27,849
But then one day...

440
00:22:27,891 --> 00:22:29,309
there's an orange.

441
00:22:29,351 --> 00:22:31,228
And now you can
make a decision.

442
00:22:31,269 --> 00:22:32,646
Do you want an apple

443
00:22:32,688 --> 00:22:34,564
or do you want an orange?

444
00:22:34,606 --> 00:22:36,274
That's democracy.

445
00:22:36,358 --> 00:22:38,318
I also like bananas.

446
00:22:39,403 --> 00:22:41,238
Exactly. Good.

447
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:42,698
So what do you say?

448
00:22:42,781 --> 00:22:45,534
Maybe it's time to give
a little something back.

449
00:22:45,617 --> 00:22:47,035
How's that?

450
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:48,495
I think that's...

451
00:22:48,537 --> 00:22:50,288
No. Just a little higher.
A little higher.

452
00:22:50,372 --> 00:22:51,540
Is this OK?

453
00:22:51,581 --> 00:22:54,668
Eric, you can't put tape
on the outside of the poster.

454
00:22:54,751 --> 00:22:56,586
It goes on the back
ofthe poster.

455
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:58,505
You better just take
the whole thing down

456
00:22:58,588 --> 00:22:59,923
and redo it.

457
00:23:04,344 --> 00:23:08,098
Aaah-a-a-aaaah

458
00:23:14,896 --> 00:23:16,189
Who put you up to this?

459
00:23:16,231 --> 00:23:17,566
Oh, hi, Tracy.

460
00:23:17,649 --> 00:23:18,734
Who put you up to this?

461
00:23:18,775 --> 00:23:19,901
What do you mean?

462
00:23:19,985 --> 00:23:21,069
You just woke up this morning

463
00:23:21,153 --> 00:23:23,321
and suddenly decided
to run for president?

464
00:23:23,405 --> 00:23:26,825
No. Um, no,
I just thought that, uh...

465
00:23:26,908 --> 00:23:27,993
Thought what?

466
00:23:28,076 --> 00:23:31,163
Well, I was talking to
Mr. McAllister about my leg

467
00:23:31,246 --> 00:23:33,540
and how I still want to do
something for the school and...

468
00:23:33,623 --> 00:23:35,542
So Mr. McAllister
asked you to run.

469
00:23:35,584 --> 00:23:38,420
Well, um, I talked to him
and everything,

470
00:23:38,462 --> 00:23:39,796
but he just said that he thought

471
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,214
it would be a good idea

472
00:23:41,298 --> 00:23:43,508
and how there's all different
kinds of fruits and, uh...

473
00:23:43,592 --> 00:23:45,761
It's nothing against you, Tracy.

474
00:23:45,802 --> 00:23:47,471
I mean, you're the best.

475
00:23:47,554 --> 00:23:49,389
Uh, I just thought, uh...

476
00:23:49,473 --> 00:23:50,349
OK.

477
00:23:50,432 --> 00:23:52,392
You're on, Mr. Popular.

478
00:23:54,186 --> 00:23:56,063
You might think it
upset me that Paul Metzler

479
00:23:56,104 --> 00:23:57,481
had decided to run against me,

480
00:23:57,522 --> 00:23:59,900
but nothing could be
further from the truth.

481
00:23:59,941 --> 00:24:01,360
He was no competition for me.

482
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,278
It was like apples and oranges.

483
00:24:04,321 --> 00:24:06,114
I had to work
a little harder, that's all.

484
00:24:06,198 --> 00:24:08,075
You see,
I believe in the voters.

485
00:24:08,116 --> 00:24:09,284
They understand that elections

486
00:24:09,326 --> 00:24:11,119
aren't just popularity contests.

487
00:24:12,162 --> 00:24:13,789
They know this country was built

488
00:24:13,872 --> 00:24:16,708
by people just like me
who work very hard

489
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,627
and don't have everything
handed to them

490
00:24:18,669 --> 00:24:19,920
on a silver spoon.

491
00:24:21,505 --> 00:24:23,882
Not like some rich kids
who everybody likes

492
00:24:23,924 --> 00:24:25,801
because their fathers
own Metzler Cement

493
00:24:25,842 --> 00:24:27,719
and give them trucks
on their 16th birthday

494
00:24:27,761 --> 00:24:29,721
and throw them big parties
all the time.

495
00:24:29,805 --> 00:24:31,890
No. They don't ever
have to work for anything.

496
00:24:31,973 --> 00:24:33,475
They think they can just,
all of a sudden,

497
00:24:33,558 --> 00:24:35,435
one day out ofthe blue
waltz right in

498
00:24:35,477 --> 00:24:36,853
with no qualifications whatsoever

499
00:24:36,895 --> 00:24:38,313
and try to take away

500
00:24:38,355 --> 00:24:39,731
what other people have worked for

501
00:24:39,773 --> 00:24:42,609
very, very hard their entire lives!

502
00:24:42,651 --> 00:24:43,568
No!

503
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:45,487
Didn't bother me at all!

504
00:24:46,988 --> 00:24:48,365
Paul.

505
00:24:48,407 --> 00:24:49,741
Paul power.

506
00:24:51,743 --> 00:24:52,619
Paul...

507
00:24:52,703 --> 00:24:54,538
Paul for president.

508
00:24:54,621 --> 00:24:55,998
Paul for president.

509
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:57,416
Promise.

510
00:24:57,499 --> 00:24:59,334
Progress.

511
00:24:59,418 --> 00:25:01,378
Peanut.

512
00:25:19,521 --> 00:25:22,065
There's a place I know

513
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:27,738
Whereyou can look down

514
00:25:30,032 --> 00:25:33,869
The air makes you feel light

515
00:25:35,871 --> 00:25:37,706
The air makes you feel right

516
00:25:37,789 --> 00:25:38,665
What?

517
00:25:38,749 --> 00:25:41,043
I told you. I can't.

518
00:25:41,126 --> 00:25:43,462
It just doesn't
feel right anymore.

519
00:25:45,464 --> 00:25:46,840
But I love you.

520
00:25:49,468 --> 00:25:50,719
I said no.

521
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,431
Hey, Tammy, guess
what happened today.

522
00:25:54,514 --> 00:25:56,350
Don't you fucking knock?

523
00:25:56,433 --> 00:25:58,560
Yeah. Oh, hi, Lisa.

524
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,686
Get out, Paul!

525
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:00,979
Listen. So Mr. McAllister,

526
00:26:01,063 --> 00:26:02,189
he calls me in,
and he tells me...

527
00:26:02,272 --> 00:26:03,523
I gotta go.

528
00:26:05,859 --> 00:26:06,735
You dumb shit!

529
00:26:06,818 --> 00:26:08,320
What'd I do?

530
00:26:08,403 --> 00:26:11,239
It's not like
I'm a lesbian or anything.

531
00:26:11,281 --> 00:26:12,658
I'm attracted to the person.

532
00:26:12,741 --> 00:26:15,535
It's just that all the people
I've ever been attracted to

533
00:26:15,619 --> 00:26:16,995
happen to be girls.

534
00:26:18,497 --> 00:26:19,873
Lisa, wait!

535
00:26:22,834 --> 00:26:23,710
Stop!

536
00:26:27,631 --> 00:26:28,507
What?

537
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,925
Where you going?

538
00:26:30,008 --> 00:26:32,344
I'm not like you, OK?

539
00:26:32,427 --> 00:26:34,221
What do you mean?

540
00:26:34,262 --> 00:26:35,681
I'm not a dyke.

541
00:26:35,764 --> 00:26:37,641
And we're not in love.

542
00:26:37,683 --> 00:26:39,559
We were just...

543
00:26:39,601 --> 00:26:41,186
experimenting.

544
00:26:53,448 --> 00:26:56,785
How can something
that seemed so true

545
00:26:56,827 --> 00:26:59,663
turn out to be such a lie?

546
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,754
Lisa and I were destined
to be together.

547
00:27:07,838 --> 00:27:10,215
Of all the people in the planet
who had ever lived,

548
00:27:10,257 --> 00:27:12,134
somehow we'd found each other.

549
00:27:12,175 --> 00:27:14,052
It was like a miracle.

550
00:27:16,972 --> 00:27:18,849
We had so much fun together,

551
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:20,767
like the time we ate
a bunch of asparagus

552
00:27:20,809 --> 00:27:23,061
to see how long it takes
before your pee smells funny.

553
00:27:24,563 --> 00:27:26,064
It was very scientific.

554
00:27:26,106 --> 00:27:27,649
For me, it was 11 minutes.

555
00:27:27,691 --> 00:27:29,735
For her, it was 17.

556
00:27:30,902 --> 00:27:33,572
Every day I found a new way
to tell Lisa

557
00:27:33,613 --> 00:27:36,158
how much I loved her.

558
00:27:36,199 --> 00:27:37,617
"If you died right now,

559
00:27:37,701 --> 00:27:40,495
I would throw myself under
one of my dad's cement trucks

560
00:27:40,579 --> 00:27:43,248
and get poured into your tomb."

561
00:27:45,751 --> 00:27:48,045
But it just seemed
like the closer we got,

562
00:27:48,128 --> 00:27:49,921
the more she pulled away.

563
00:27:50,005 --> 00:27:51,631
Are you crazy?

564
00:27:51,715 --> 00:27:52,591
What?

565
00:27:52,674 --> 00:27:53,800
These are private.
These are for us.

566
00:27:53,884 --> 00:27:54,843
So?

567
00:27:54,885 --> 00:27:56,636
But other people
can see them, too.

568
00:27:56,678 --> 00:27:57,971
I don't care.

569
00:27:58,055 --> 00:27:59,598
Well, I do.

570
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,354
What did I do
to make her change?

571
00:28:06,855 --> 00:28:08,231
What's wrong with me?

572
00:28:11,193 --> 00:28:13,028
Sometimes when I'm sad,

573
00:28:13,111 --> 00:28:15,906
I sit and watch
the power station.

574
00:28:15,989 --> 00:28:19,242
They say if you lie between
2 of the main wires,

575
00:28:19,326 --> 00:28:21,161
your body just evaporates.

576
00:28:21,244 --> 00:28:23,080
You become a gas.

577
00:28:23,163 --> 00:28:25,999
I wonder what that
would feel like.

578
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:34,633
I don't know why,

579
00:28:34,716 --> 00:28:37,511
but Lisa decided
she wanted to hurt me.

580
00:28:37,594 --> 00:28:40,389
And she knew exactly what to do.

581
00:28:42,516 --> 00:28:44,685
I sure was surprised
the day Lisa Flanagan

582
00:28:44,768 --> 00:28:47,938
asked me for a ride home
and ended up blowing me.

583
00:28:49,106 --> 00:28:51,400
I've wanted this for so long.

584
00:28:52,651 --> 00:28:54,945
I mean, life is so weird.

585
00:28:55,028 --> 00:28:57,656
First, Lisa has a big fight
with my sister,

586
00:28:57,739 --> 00:29:01,326
and the next thing you know,
she's my girlfriend.

587
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:03,912
Since Lisa knew all about
public relations and stuff,

588
00:29:03,996 --> 00:29:06,331
she offered to help me
with my campaign.

589
00:29:06,415 --> 00:29:08,208
We made a great team.

590
00:29:08,291 --> 00:29:11,086
It seemed so natural,
the two of us together.

591
00:29:11,169 --> 00:29:13,005
It was like a miracle.

592
00:29:15,382 --> 00:29:17,801
My leg wasn't bugging me too much

593
00:29:17,884 --> 00:29:19,261
and the weather was so nice.

594
00:29:19,344 --> 00:29:20,721
And every day after school

595
00:29:20,762 --> 00:29:24,558
Lisa and I would go to her house
to fuck and have a hot tub.

596
00:29:43,243 --> 00:29:45,120
If that's the way
they wanted it,

597
00:29:45,162 --> 00:29:46,913
then that's the way
it was gonna be.

598
00:29:46,997 --> 00:29:49,416
But I wasn't going down
without a fight.

599
00:29:55,756 --> 00:29:56,673
Tammy?

600
00:29:58,633 --> 00:30:00,844
Tammy, what are you doing?

601
00:30:00,927 --> 00:30:02,846
You're the advisor.
You should stop her.

602
00:30:02,929 --> 00:30:04,723
She's not qualified.
She's just a sophomore.

603
00:30:04,806 --> 00:30:05,724
Did you know that?

604
00:30:05,807 --> 00:30:07,517
Calm down, Tracy.
Just calm down.

605
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:09,102
We can't both run, can we?

606
00:30:09,186 --> 00:30:10,437
I mean, we're brother and sister.

607
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,521
Can we?

608
00:30:11,605 --> 00:30:13,482
It's a conflict of interest,
and Paul was first.

609
00:30:13,565 --> 00:30:15,859
Anybody who gets signatures
in on time can run,

610
00:30:15,901 --> 00:30:17,778
and she got in
just under the wire.

611
00:30:19,738 --> 00:30:21,907
These are a bunch of burnouts.

612
00:30:21,948 --> 00:30:23,992
And what's this one?
It's illegible.

613
00:30:24,076 --> 00:30:25,327
I can't even read that.

614
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:27,329
That's Tim... Cobsa.

615
00:30:27,412 --> 00:30:29,790
She's doing this
to get back at me.

616
00:30:29,831 --> 00:30:30,749
For what?

617
00:30:30,791 --> 00:30:33,126
I mean, at you.

618
00:30:33,168 --> 00:30:34,586
For what?

619
00:30:34,628 --> 00:30:36,421
Tim Cobsa?

620
00:30:36,505 --> 00:30:39,383
Tim Cobsa? Who's he?
I've never even heard of him.

621
00:30:39,466 --> 00:30:41,218
Look, why don't we
just forget about Tammy?

622
00:30:41,301 --> 00:30:42,678
We'll have the assembly tomorrow.

623
00:30:42,719 --> 00:30:44,096
Everybody can make their speeches,

624
00:30:44,179 --> 00:30:46,515
and I'm sure everything's
gonna be just fine.

625
00:30:46,682 --> 00:30:47,474
Hey! Whee!

626
00:30:47,557 --> 00:30:49,851
Jim, don't.
You're scaring him.

627
00:30:49,935 --> 00:30:51,728
Nah. He likes it.

628
00:30:51,812 --> 00:30:52,729
Not that much.

629
00:30:52,813 --> 00:30:54,189
Around that time,

630
00:30:54,272 --> 00:30:56,108
Diane and I were
hanging out a lot

631
00:30:56,191 --> 00:30:57,359
at Linda Novotny's house,

632
00:30:57,401 --> 00:30:59,444
giving her our love and support

633
00:30:59,528 --> 00:31:02,906
and helping her make it
through a difficult time.

634
00:31:07,703 --> 00:31:10,038
Diane really wanted to have kids,

635
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,331
and so did I,

636
00:31:11,373 --> 00:31:13,834
but it seemed like there
was always a reason to wait:

637
00:31:13,917 --> 00:31:15,752
She had to finish
nursing school,

638
00:31:15,836 --> 00:31:17,212
I had to get my master's,

639
00:31:17,295 --> 00:31:20,090
we needed a new house,
we needed more money.

640
00:31:20,173 --> 00:31:22,300
Finally, we just decided
to go for it.

641
00:31:22,467 --> 00:31:23,719
You gonna do it?

642
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,137
You gonna do it?

643
00:31:25,178 --> 00:31:28,223
And for over a year,
we hadn't had any luck.

644
00:31:28,306 --> 00:31:30,600
Come on. Do it. Do it.

645
00:31:30,684 --> 00:31:32,519
Fill me up. Come on.

646
00:31:32,561 --> 00:31:34,438
Fill me up.

647
00:31:34,479 --> 00:31:35,856
Fill me up.

648
00:31:43,572 --> 00:31:44,489
OK.

649
00:31:49,828 --> 00:31:50,746
Good job.

650
00:31:58,462 --> 00:31:59,588
Say, Jim?

651
00:32:01,089 --> 00:32:02,507
Jim, can you get this?

652
00:32:02,591 --> 00:32:03,717
I can't.

653
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:05,135
Oh, yeah, sure.

654
00:32:05,177 --> 00:32:07,054
Just put it on the table.

655
00:32:07,095 --> 00:32:08,013
All right.

656
00:32:12,351 --> 00:32:13,310
Without Dave around,

657
00:32:13,393 --> 00:32:15,228
Linda needed a lot of help
around the house.

658
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:16,813
Where do you want it, here?

659
00:32:16,855 --> 00:32:17,773
No.

660
00:32:19,107 --> 00:32:20,484
More this way.

661
00:32:21,985 --> 00:32:23,528
Here?

662
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:25,822
Uh, yeah. That's good.

663
00:32:28,742 --> 00:32:31,953
I had always liked Linda,
but we'd never had a chance

664
00:32:32,037 --> 00:32:34,414
to spend any time
alone together.

665
00:32:34,456 --> 00:32:36,416
Oughta warm you up a little bit.

666
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,709
Now with Dave
out of the picture,

667
00:32:37,793 --> 00:32:39,628
I began to see what
an incredibly sensitive

668
00:32:39,711 --> 00:32:42,756
and giving person she was.

669
00:32:42,798 --> 00:32:45,175
We got to be
kind of like buddies.

670
00:32:45,217 --> 00:32:46,343
I even took her to the mall
one time

671
00:32:46,426 --> 00:32:48,345
while her car was in the shop.

672
00:32:51,223 --> 00:32:52,641
What do you think?

673
00:32:54,101 --> 00:32:55,686
You look great.

674
00:32:55,769 --> 00:32:58,355
I can't afford this stuff right now.

675
00:32:58,438 --> 00:33:00,190
Ah, come on.
You've had a hard year.

676
00:33:00,232 --> 00:33:02,192
You're cooped up
all the time with the kid.

677
00:33:02,275 --> 00:33:03,568
Let go. Live a little.

678
00:33:03,652 --> 00:33:04,528
You sure?

679
00:33:04,611 --> 00:33:05,487
Yeah.

680
00:33:08,031 --> 00:33:09,866
So what do you think?

681
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:11,284
Should we get a room?

682
00:33:11,368 --> 00:33:12,744
Should we get a what?

683
00:33:25,298 --> 00:33:26,633
That's not funny.

684
00:33:34,349 --> 00:33:36,226
How'd it go?

685
00:33:36,268 --> 00:33:37,185
Fine.

686
00:33:37,227 --> 00:33:38,145
You know...

687
00:33:38,186 --> 00:33:40,063
just went to Westerly's.

688
00:33:40,105 --> 00:33:41,898
Did you guys have fun?

689
00:33:43,442 --> 00:33:44,860
Um...

690
00:33:44,901 --> 00:33:45,819
yeah.

691
00:33:45,861 --> 00:33:48,322
No, I mean... you know.

692
00:33:48,405 --> 00:33:50,741
What?

693
00:33:50,782 --> 00:33:53,035
Well, Linda's great,

694
00:33:53,076 --> 00:33:55,746
but she can be
a little bit much sometimes.

695
00:33:57,873 --> 00:33:59,124
Yeah.

696
00:33:59,207 --> 00:34:01,626
Oh, God.
Oh, just like that.

697
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:02,627
Yeah.

698
00:34:02,711 --> 00:34:04,046
Fill me up.

699
00:34:04,129 --> 00:34:05,964
Fill me up.

700
00:34:06,048 --> 00:34:08,842
Oh... yeah.

701
00:34:08,884 --> 00:34:09,801
Fill me up.

702
00:34:11,303 --> 00:34:12,220
Oh, God.

703
00:34:12,262 --> 00:34:13,680
Just like that.

704
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:14,890
Oh, yeah.

705
00:34:14,931 --> 00:34:16,016
Fill me up.

706
00:34:16,099 --> 00:34:18,185
God. Oh, God!

707
00:34:18,268 --> 00:34:20,354
Oh, God. Just like that.

708
00:34:20,437 --> 00:34:22,773
Do it, Jim. Fuck me.

709
00:34:22,814 --> 00:34:23,732
Do it, Jim.

710
00:34:23,774 --> 00:34:25,233
Just like that.

711
00:34:25,317 --> 00:34:27,944
Do it, Jim. Fill me up.

712
00:34:28,028 --> 00:34:30,364
Just like that.
Do it, Mr. M.

713
00:34:30,447 --> 00:34:33,075
Do it. Fuck me, Mr. M.
Fuck me!

714
00:34:33,158 --> 00:34:35,160
Fuck me hard, Mr. McAllister.

715
00:34:35,243 --> 00:34:36,119
Harder! Harder!

716
00:34:36,203 --> 00:34:39,039
Fuck me, Mr. McAllister.
Fuck me hard!

717
00:34:39,081 --> 00:34:41,416
Harder! Fuck me! Please!

718
00:34:42,959 --> 00:34:44,294
So like I was saying,

719
00:34:44,378 --> 00:34:46,254
things were going
pretty well in my life.

720
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,632
That is, until things
started going all hay wire

721
00:34:48,715 --> 00:34:50,050
with that damn election.

722
00:34:50,133 --> 00:34:52,928
I love Carver High.

723
00:34:53,011 --> 00:34:56,306
And I will be a dedicated
vice president.

724
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:59,643
A vote for Jerry Slavin is
a vote for good government.

725
00:34:59,726 --> 00:35:03,480
And even if I can't really
stand up for you, I will.

726
00:35:05,023 --> 00:35:06,108
Thank you.

727
00:35:11,279 --> 00:35:12,614
Thank you, Jerry.

728
00:35:12,698 --> 00:35:14,074
Thank you and good luck.

729
00:35:14,157 --> 00:35:17,327
Again, Jerry is running
unopposed for vice president.

730
00:35:17,411 --> 00:35:20,789
So, we'll move on now
to the presidential race

731
00:35:20,872 --> 00:35:22,207
with 3 candidates running.

732
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:24,543
The first,
in alphabetical order,

733
00:35:24,626 --> 00:35:26,461
is Tracy Flick.

734
00:35:26,545 --> 00:35:27,421
Tracy?

735
00:35:34,302 --> 00:35:37,514
Poet Henry David Thoreau
once wrote,

736
00:35:37,597 --> 00:35:39,725
"I cannot make my days longer,

737
00:35:39,808 --> 00:35:41,768
so I strive to make them better."

738
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:44,229
With this election,
we here at Carver

739
00:35:44,312 --> 00:35:45,647
also have an opportunity

740
00:35:45,731 --> 00:35:47,691
to make our
high school days better.

741
00:35:47,774 --> 00:35:50,944
During this campaign,
I've spoken with many of you

742
00:35:51,028 --> 00:35:52,362
about your many concerns.

743
00:35:52,446 --> 00:35:54,781
I spoke with Eliza Ramirez,

744
00:35:54,865 --> 00:35:57,200
a freshman who said
she feels alienated

745
00:35:57,242 --> 00:35:58,744
from her own home room.

746
00:35:58,785 --> 00:36:00,537
I spoke with sophomore Reggie Banks

747
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:02,956
who said his mother works
in the cafeteria

748
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,875
and can't afford to buy him
enough spiral notebooks

749
00:36:04,916 --> 00:36:05,834
for his classes.

750
00:36:05,876 --> 00:36:06,793
Eat me!

751
00:36:06,877 --> 00:36:08,253
Eat me raw!

752
00:36:13,091 --> 00:36:14,468
All right, now.

753
00:36:14,551 --> 00:36:16,845
Hey, ifyou can't be adults

754
00:36:16,928 --> 00:36:19,723
and give these candidates
the courtesy they deserve,

755
00:36:19,806 --> 00:36:22,601
then you don't deserve to be
called adults but children

756
00:36:22,601 --> 00:36:24,019
because that's what children are,

757
00:36:24,061 --> 00:36:25,937
and you'll be treated like children.

758
00:36:25,979 --> 00:36:28,357
So let's all listen up, huh?

759
00:36:32,235 --> 00:36:34,112
I care about Carver,

760
00:36:34,154 --> 00:36:36,031
and I care about each
and every one of you.

761
00:36:36,073 --> 00:36:38,492
And together, we can all
make a difference.

762
00:36:38,575 --> 00:36:41,787
When you cast your vote
for Tracy Flick next week,

763
00:36:41,828 --> 00:36:44,164
you won't just be voting for me.

764
00:36:44,206 --> 00:36:46,249
You'll be voting for yourself

765
00:36:46,291 --> 00:36:48,960
and for every other student
here at Carver.

766
00:36:49,002 --> 00:36:51,380
Our days might not be any longer,

767
00:36:51,421 --> 00:36:53,465
but they can sure be better.

768
00:36:53,507 --> 00:36:54,466
Thank you.

769
00:37:01,515 --> 00:37:04,810
The... The next candidate
for student body president

770
00:37:04,851 --> 00:37:06,269
is Paul Metzler.

771
00:37:06,311 --> 00:37:07,229
Paul?

772
00:37:09,648 --> 00:37:12,067
Woof woof woof woof
woof woof woof woof!.

773
00:37:15,404 --> 00:37:17,197
- Whoo!
- Hey, Paul!

774
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:18,407
Paul!

775
00:37:36,967 --> 00:37:38,802
"As many of you know,

776
00:37:38,885 --> 00:37:40,721
I broke my leg pretty bad this year,

777
00:37:40,804 --> 00:37:42,639
and the experience
has made me reevaluate

778
00:37:42,723 --> 00:37:44,099
what I want to do with my life,

779
00:37:44,182 --> 00:37:45,559
and that is help people.

780
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,977
When you think about it,

781
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,520
a school is more than a school.

782
00:37:48,603 --> 00:37:50,355
It's our second home,
where we spend all our time

783
00:37:50,439 --> 00:37:53,233
and grow as individuals
in the community.

784
00:37:53,316 --> 00:37:55,152
But is our school
everything it could be?

785
00:37:55,235 --> 00:37:58,030
I want our school to reach
its true potential.

786
00:37:58,113 --> 00:37:59,448
That's why I'm running for president.

787
00:37:59,531 --> 00:38:01,366
I know what it is
to fight hard and win,

788
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:03,285
like when we almost went
to State last fall

789
00:38:03,368 --> 00:38:06,163
and I threw the fourth quarter
pass against Westside

790
00:38:06,246 --> 00:38:08,081
for the touchdown that
won the game by 3 points.

791
00:38:08,165 --> 00:38:10,000
I won't let you down
like I didn't then,

792
00:38:10,083 --> 00:38:13,378
and I promise we can all score
a winning touchdown together.

793
00:38:13,462 --> 00:38:15,297
Vote Paul Metzler
for president.

794
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,256
Thank you."

795
00:38:29,269 --> 00:38:30,604
OK, Paul.

796
00:38:30,687 --> 00:38:33,982
The final candidate for
student council president

797
00:38:34,066 --> 00:38:36,360
is another one
ofthe Metzler clan,

798
00:38:36,443 --> 00:38:37,819
sophomore Tammy Metzler.

799
00:38:37,903 --> 00:38:38,820
Tammy.

800
00:38:50,457 --> 00:38:52,125
Ha ha ha ha!

801
00:38:52,209 --> 00:38:54,586
People! People!

802
00:38:58,548 --> 00:39:02,469
Who cares about
this stupid election?

803
00:39:07,432 --> 00:39:09,518
We all know it doesn't matter

804
00:39:09,559 --> 00:39:11,895
who gets elected
president of Carver.

805
00:39:11,978 --> 00:39:15,232
Do you really think it's gonna
change anything around here,

806
00:39:15,273 --> 00:39:19,528
make one single person
smarter or happier

807
00:39:19,569 --> 00:39:21,446
or nicer?

808
00:39:21,488 --> 00:39:23,865
The only person
it does matter to

809
00:39:23,907 --> 00:39:25,784
is the one who gets elected.

810
00:39:25,826 --> 00:39:30,080
The same pathetic charade
happens every year,

811
00:39:30,122 --> 00:39:33,000
and everyone makes
the same pathetic promises

812
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,918
just so they could put it
on their transcripts

813
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,837
to get into college.

814
00:39:36,878 --> 00:39:38,255
So vote for me

815
00:39:38,296 --> 00:39:40,674
because I don't even
wanna go to college,

816
00:39:40,716 --> 00:39:42,092
and I don't care.

817
00:39:42,134 --> 00:39:44,970
And as president,
I won't do anything.

818
00:39:45,012 --> 00:39:48,807
The only promise I will make
is that, if elected,

819
00:39:48,849 --> 00:39:51,685
I will immediately dismantle
the student government

820
00:39:51,727 --> 00:39:53,603
so that none of us will
ever have to sit through

821
00:39:53,645 --> 00:39:55,689
one of these
stupid assemblies again!

822
00:39:59,943 --> 00:40:01,153
Whoo!

823
00:40:01,236 --> 00:40:02,404
Yeah!

824
00:40:02,487 --> 00:40:08,785
Tammy! Tammy! Tammy! Tammy!
Tammy! Tammy! Tammy! Tammy!

825
00:40:08,869 --> 00:40:10,120
Tammy! Tammy!

826
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,914
Or don't vote for me!
Who cares?!

827
00:40:12,998 --> 00:40:14,249
Don't vote at all!

828
00:40:32,225 --> 00:40:33,643
Close the door.

829
00:40:34,811 --> 00:40:37,356
I tell you, that little bitch

830
00:40:37,439 --> 00:40:38,565
made a fool out of us.

831
00:40:38,607 --> 00:40:41,068
I want her out of this election.

832
00:40:41,151 --> 00:40:43,070
I mean, getting everybody
all riled up like that.

833
00:40:43,153 --> 00:40:44,780
She is washed up,
you understand me?

834
00:40:44,863 --> 00:40:45,822
She's finished.

835
00:40:45,906 --> 00:40:47,491
Well, we can't throw
her out of the election

836
00:40:47,574 --> 00:40:49,201
just because we
don't like her speech.

837
00:40:49,284 --> 00:40:52,496
That's not what student
government is about.

838
00:40:52,537 --> 00:40:54,498
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

839
00:40:54,581 --> 00:40:55,999
Look, all I know is

840
00:40:56,041 --> 00:40:58,085
she's a troublemaker,
she's on my list.

841
00:40:58,126 --> 00:40:59,795
All we need to do
is send a message.

842
00:40:59,878 --> 00:41:03,799
So maybe, uh, we should
just suspend her.

843
00:41:05,425 --> 00:41:09,471
That's it. 3 days,
she's suspended for 3 days.

844
00:41:13,183 --> 00:41:15,352
Being suspended is
like getting a paid vacation.

845
00:41:15,435 --> 00:41:17,521
Why do they think
it's a punishment?

846
00:41:17,604 --> 00:41:19,523
It's like your dog
pees on the carpet

847
00:41:19,564 --> 00:41:21,274
and you give him a treat.

848
00:41:21,358 --> 00:41:23,151
Then you get in trouble
for skipping school.

849
00:41:23,235 --> 00:41:24,861
It's so stupid.

850
00:41:24,945 --> 00:41:26,905
Hendricks told me,
"One more time"

851
00:41:26,947 --> 00:41:30,200
and I'd be expelled.
Sounded good to me.

852
00:42:27,591 --> 00:42:30,260
Oh, hi, Tammy.

853
00:42:32,012 --> 00:42:33,305
What do you want?

854
00:42:33,347 --> 00:42:35,307
Well, I went to all your teachers

855
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:36,641
and got your assignments for you.

856
00:42:36,725 --> 00:42:39,102
I... I just thought, you know,

857
00:42:39,144 --> 00:42:40,062
last time you got suspended

858
00:42:40,145 --> 00:42:41,021
you fell so far behind,

859
00:42:41,104 --> 00:42:41,980
and I just didn't want

860
00:42:42,064 --> 00:42:43,440
to see that happen again.

861
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,359
Thanks, Paul. Thanks a lot.

862
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,277
Sure. You bet.

863
00:42:48,904 --> 00:42:50,405
Now could you leave me alone?

864
00:42:50,447 --> 00:42:52,741
Oh, yeah. Um,

865
00:42:52,824 --> 00:42:55,410
Tammy, there's just
one other thing.

866
00:42:55,494 --> 00:42:57,788
You know all
this election stuff,

867
00:42:57,829 --> 00:42:59,706
'cause everybody's
saying it's really weird

868
00:42:59,748 --> 00:43:00,707
that you're running against me

869
00:43:00,749 --> 00:43:02,376
and everything,
and it is kind of weird.

870
00:43:02,459 --> 00:43:04,795
You haven't really told me
why you're doing it

871
00:43:04,878 --> 00:43:06,296
and you didn't
tell me in advance,

872
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:09,299
but that's OK.
I respect your privacy,

873
00:43:09,383 --> 00:43:11,718
it's just...
I want you to know

874
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:12,969
that no matter who wins,

875
00:43:13,053 --> 00:43:15,180
you or me,
there's no hard feelings.

876
00:43:15,263 --> 00:43:17,599
We're still brother
and sister, OK,

877
00:43:17,641 --> 00:43:18,600
even though you're adopted,

878
00:43:18,642 --> 00:43:22,270
'cause I hope you feel the same.

879
00:43:25,983 --> 00:43:27,734
What happened
at the speeches

880
00:43:27,818 --> 00:43:29,945
was an unconscionable travesty.

881
00:43:29,987 --> 00:43:31,655
That little bitch Tammy Metzler

882
00:43:31,738 --> 00:43:32,990
wanted to make a fool out of me.

883
00:43:33,073 --> 00:43:35,492
Well, it wasn't gonna work.

884
00:43:35,575 --> 00:43:38,120
Ifall those students
who cheered for Tammy Metzler

885
00:43:38,161 --> 00:43:40,247
only knew how hard
I worked for Carver,

886
00:43:40,330 --> 00:43:42,582
like all the late nights
I spend at the year book office

887
00:43:42,624 --> 00:43:44,626
just to give them
their stinking memories.

888
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:52,426
One of my duties was
to clean up the group photos.

889
00:43:52,509 --> 00:43:55,804
It was a cinch
with our new software.

890
00:43:57,472 --> 00:44:00,600
People are so ungrateful.

891
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:11,380
Ahh-a-a-aah, aaah-a-a-aaah

892
00:45:28,814 --> 00:45:30,899
Aaagh! Aaagh!

893
00:45:30,983 --> 00:45:34,277
Aaagh!

894
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:23,303
The day before the election

895
00:47:23,387 --> 00:47:26,848
was when things started
to get really complicated.

896
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:28,392
There's your culprit.

897
00:47:28,475 --> 00:47:31,687
Linda had asked me to stop by
on my way to school

898
00:47:31,770 --> 00:47:35,232
to help her out with
a little plumbing problem.

899
00:47:35,315 --> 00:47:37,943
Did you know Dave's a bed-wetter?

900
00:47:38,026 --> 00:47:41,488
No. No, I... I didn't know that.

901
00:47:41,571 --> 00:47:43,615
All his life.
He's tried everything.

902
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:49,705
Is that still running clear?

903
00:47:49,788 --> 00:47:50,747
Yeah.

904
00:47:50,831 --> 00:47:52,499
Better let it run for a while.

905
00:47:52,582 --> 00:47:54,418
OK.

906
00:47:54,501 --> 00:47:56,712
Oh, wait.

907
00:47:56,795 --> 00:47:59,923
Here. This one's clean.

908
00:48:03,427 --> 00:48:05,303
I guess you better
get to work, huh?

909
00:48:05,387 --> 00:48:06,888
You're gonna be late.

910
00:48:06,972 --> 00:48:09,391
Yeah.

911
00:48:19,067 --> 00:48:21,486
Thank you, Jim.

912
00:48:33,915 --> 00:48:36,168
It was something
that just happened.

913
00:48:36,209 --> 00:48:38,128
Neither of us expected it.

914
00:48:38,211 --> 00:48:39,880
Neither of us planned it.

915
00:48:39,921 --> 00:48:43,342
But once we started, we knew
there was no turning back.

916
00:48:43,383 --> 00:48:46,928
It was a miracle.

917
00:48:47,012 --> 00:48:48,805
Oh, Jim.

918
00:48:59,316 --> 00:49:01,818
Hey, take me to that motel,

919
00:49:01,902 --> 00:49:02,986
like you wanted.

920
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:04,655
Now?

921
00:49:04,738 --> 00:49:06,406
Um, come by after school.

922
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:07,908
I'll leave Darryl with a sitter.

923
00:49:07,991 --> 00:49:10,744
Oh. 3:25.

924
00:49:10,827 --> 00:49:12,788
OK, 3:25.

925
00:49:21,630 --> 00:49:22,714
What had blossomed

926
00:49:22,756 --> 00:49:24,549
between Linda and me
was too real,

927
00:49:24,633 --> 00:49:26,426
too powerful to deny.

928
00:49:26,468 --> 00:49:28,053
For the first time in years,

929
00:49:28,136 --> 00:49:30,681
I felt free and alive.

930
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:36,436
Hiya, Jim.

931
00:49:58,291 --> 00:50:00,877
It's not fair,
it's just not fair.

932
00:50:00,961 --> 00:50:02,337
I just don't think somebody

933
00:50:02,421 --> 00:50:04,089
would do something
like that on purpose.

934
00:50:04,172 --> 00:50:06,383
It must be some
sort of mistake,

935
00:50:06,425 --> 00:50:08,343
like a maintenance thing.

936
00:50:08,427 --> 00:50:11,346
Jim, where the hell
have you been?

937
00:50:11,388 --> 00:50:14,641
Nowhere. I... I don't
have any classes

938
00:50:14,725 --> 00:50:15,600
till second period.

939
00:50:15,684 --> 00:50:16,768
Well, I tried you at home,

940
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:18,562
and we've got a situation here.

941
00:50:18,645 --> 00:50:19,980
If Paul loses
this election tomorrow,

942
00:50:20,022 --> 00:50:21,189
there has to be another one

943
00:50:21,273 --> 00:50:22,441
with posters.

944
00:50:22,482 --> 00:50:24,359
Somebody tore down their posters.

945
00:50:24,401 --> 00:50:25,902
Those posters cost
us a lot of money,

946
00:50:25,986 --> 00:50:27,112
and there's no time
to make any more.

947
00:50:27,195 --> 00:50:28,530
All right, we'll get
to the bottom of it.

948
00:50:28,613 --> 00:50:30,282
We still have some extra ones,
don't we?

949
00:50:30,365 --> 00:50:31,658
Maybe we could just use those.

950
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:32,617
It was Tammy.

951
00:50:32,659 --> 00:50:33,577
That's who it was.

952
00:50:33,618 --> 00:50:35,537
Oh, no. Hey, like I said,

953
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:37,080
she just wouldn't do
something like that.

954
00:50:37,164 --> 00:50:38,749
Well, that speech that she gave,

955
00:50:38,832 --> 00:50:40,042
you know, it was pretty...

956
00:50:40,125 --> 00:50:42,127
It was out there.

957
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:43,462
But we'll get
to the bottom of it.

958
00:50:43,545 --> 00:50:45,839
I want you two to go back,

959
00:50:45,881 --> 00:50:47,758
I want you to focus on your studies.

960
00:50:47,799 --> 00:50:50,552
Mr. McAllister will handle
the whole thing.

961
00:50:50,594 --> 00:50:52,554
Right, Jim?

962
00:50:52,637 --> 00:50:56,433
What's that? Oh, yeah.
Sure, yeah, you bet.

963
00:51:04,650 --> 00:51:06,652
Tracy.

964
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:12,658
Tracy, come on in.

965
00:51:12,741 --> 00:51:15,077
Close the door behind you.

966
00:51:20,666 --> 00:51:22,709
Have a seat.

967
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:29,758
I guess you know
why you're here.

968
00:51:32,010 --> 00:51:33,220
If it's about the posters,

969
00:51:33,303 --> 00:51:34,429
I think it's awful.

970
00:51:34,513 --> 00:51:36,306
I think it's a travesty.

971
00:51:36,348 --> 00:51:37,683
Travesty, huh?

972
00:51:37,766 --> 00:51:40,894
Well, that's interesting,

973
00:51:40,977 --> 00:51:43,146
because I think you did it.

974
00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:45,315
What?

975
00:51:46,775 --> 00:51:48,777
Are you accusing me?

976
00:51:48,819 --> 00:51:50,320
You're not serious.

977
00:51:50,362 --> 00:51:52,155
Mr. McAllister,
we've worked together

978
00:51:52,197 --> 00:51:54,366
on the S.G.A. for 3 solid years.

979
00:51:54,408 --> 00:51:56,368
Besides, my own best banner
was torn down.

980
00:51:56,451 --> 00:51:57,744
Did I do that, too?

981
00:51:57,786 --> 00:51:59,121
Were you or were you not

982
00:51:59,204 --> 00:52:01,039
working in the Looking Glass Office

983
00:52:01,123 --> 00:52:02,040
over the weekend?

984
00:52:02,082 --> 00:52:05,669
I was. So?
Mr. Paterno let me in.

985
00:52:05,752 --> 00:52:07,921
As you know, with my
many responsibilities,

986
00:52:08,005 --> 00:52:09,423
I often have to come in
on the weekend.

987
00:52:09,464 --> 00:52:11,425
And I have permission to do so.

988
00:52:11,508 --> 00:52:14,094
But I left very early,
around 6:30.

989
00:52:15,303 --> 00:52:18,890
6:30. 6:30?

990
00:52:18,974 --> 00:52:21,476
How do you know what time
the posters were torn down?

991
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:24,104
I don't. I just know

992
00:52:24,187 --> 00:52:25,605
that they were there when I left.

993
00:52:25,689 --> 00:52:28,025
I'm giving you helpful
information, that's all.

994
00:52:28,066 --> 00:52:29,026
You know, instead
of wasting your time

995
00:52:29,109 --> 00:52:30,068
interrogating me,

996
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:32,112
we should be out there

997
00:52:32,154 --> 00:52:33,280
trying to figure out
who did this.

998
00:52:33,322 --> 00:52:35,449
OK, Tracy.

999
00:52:35,490 --> 00:52:37,075
Who do you think did it?

1000
00:52:37,159 --> 00:52:38,994
Whom should we interrogate?

1001
00:52:39,036 --> 00:52:40,704
Well, I don't know.

1002
00:52:40,787 --> 00:52:42,122
You know, it could
have been anybody.

1003
00:52:42,205 --> 00:52:44,499
There's a lot of subversive
elements here at Carver,

1004
00:52:44,583 --> 00:52:48,045
like Rick Thiessen or
Kevin Speck and those burnouts.

1005
00:52:48,128 --> 00:52:49,171
Or what about Tammy Metzler?

1006
00:52:49,254 --> 00:52:50,172
I mean, her whole thing

1007
00:52:50,213 --> 00:52:52,424
is being anti-this and anti-that.

1008
00:52:53,842 --> 00:52:56,887
Tracy, you're
a very intelligent girl.

1009
00:52:56,970 --> 00:52:59,765
You have a lot of
admirable qualities.

1010
00:52:59,806 --> 00:53:01,641
But one day maybe you'll learn

1011
00:53:01,725 --> 00:53:02,726
that being smart

1012
00:53:02,809 --> 00:53:05,354
and doing whatever you
need to do to get ahead

1013
00:53:05,437 --> 00:53:06,938
and, yes, stepping
on other people

1014
00:53:07,022 --> 00:53:08,273
to get there,

1015
00:53:08,315 --> 00:53:11,902
well, there's a whole lot
more to life than that.

1016
00:53:11,985 --> 00:53:14,488
And, in the end, you're
only cheating yourself.

1017
00:53:15,656 --> 00:53:17,741
Why are you lecturing me?

1018
00:53:17,824 --> 00:53:22,204
This isn't the time or
the place to get into it.

1019
00:53:22,287 --> 00:53:24,498
But there is,
for just one example,

1020
00:53:24,581 --> 00:53:26,500
a certain former colleague of mine

1021
00:53:26,541 --> 00:53:30,087
who made a very big mistake,
a life mistake.

1022
00:53:30,170 --> 00:53:31,546
Now, I think
the lesson here is that,

1023
00:53:31,630 --> 00:53:35,175
old or young,
we all make mistakes.

1024
00:53:35,258 --> 00:53:37,052
And we have to learn
that our actions,

1025
00:53:37,094 --> 00:53:42,015
all of them, can carry
serious consequences.

1026
00:53:42,057 --> 00:53:45,227
Mm-hmm. I don't know
what you're referring to,

1027
00:53:45,268 --> 00:53:47,854
but maybe if certain
older, wiser people

1028
00:53:47,938 --> 00:53:49,856
hadn't acted like such little babies

1029
00:53:49,898 --> 00:53:51,024
and gotten so mushy,

1030
00:53:51,108 --> 00:53:53,068
then everything would be OK.

1031
00:53:53,110 --> 00:53:55,487
I agree, and I also think

1032
00:53:55,570 --> 00:53:57,322
that certain young and naive people

1033
00:53:57,406 --> 00:53:59,282
need to thank their lucky stars

1034
00:53:59,366 --> 00:54:01,076
and be very, very grateful

1035
00:54:01,159 --> 00:54:03,203
the entire school didn't find out

1036
00:54:03,286 --> 00:54:04,621
about certain indiscretions

1037
00:54:04,705 --> 00:54:07,040
that could've ruined
their reputations

1038
00:54:07,124 --> 00:54:10,043
and their chances
to win certain elections.

1039
00:54:10,127 --> 00:54:11,920
And I think
certain older people,

1040
00:54:11,962 --> 00:54:13,880
like you and your colleague,

1041
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:15,799
shouldn't be letching
after their students,

1042
00:54:15,841 --> 00:54:16,800
especially when some of them

1043
00:54:16,842 --> 00:54:18,635
can't even get
their own wives pregnant,

1044
00:54:18,719 --> 00:54:20,345
and they certainly shouldn't be

1045
00:54:20,429 --> 00:54:22,723
making slanderous accusations,

1046
00:54:22,806 --> 00:54:24,891
especially when certain
young, naive people's mothers

1047
00:54:24,933 --> 00:54:26,226
are paralegal secretaries

1048
00:54:26,309 --> 00:54:27,477
at the city's biggest law firm

1049
00:54:27,519 --> 00:54:29,730
and have won many
successful lawsuits.

1050
00:54:29,771 --> 00:54:32,149
And if you want to keep
questioning me like this,

1051
00:54:32,232 --> 00:54:35,235
I won't continue
without my attorney present.

1052
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:42,159
You wanted to see me,
Mr. McAllister?

1053
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:44,369
Just wait outside, Tammy.

1054
00:54:44,453 --> 00:54:47,247
OK, but is this
about the posters?

1055
00:54:47,331 --> 00:54:49,875
Possibly. Please,
just wait outside.

1056
00:54:49,916 --> 00:54:53,045
OK, because I know who did it.

1057
00:54:53,086 --> 00:54:55,839
So, I'll just be outside.

1058
00:54:59,217 --> 00:55:00,510
Don't go anywhere, Tracy.

1059
00:55:00,594 --> 00:55:02,679
Tammy, come on in here.

1060
00:55:04,139 --> 00:55:06,308
This ought to be good.

1061
00:55:09,061 --> 00:55:11,146
So, what do you have
to tell me, Tammy?

1062
00:55:11,188 --> 00:55:13,440
Well, this is hard for me,

1063
00:55:13,482 --> 00:55:15,525
but I think it's
important to be honest,

1064
00:55:15,609 --> 00:55:16,693
don't you?

1065
00:55:16,777 --> 00:55:18,403
Yeah. What is it, Tammy?

1066
00:55:18,487 --> 00:55:23,408
I did it. I'm the one
who tore down Paul's posters.

1067
00:55:23,492 --> 00:55:25,869
I did it.

1068
00:55:25,911 --> 00:55:27,245
When did you do it?

1069
00:55:27,329 --> 00:55:29,956
I don't know...
Yesterday, Sunday.

1070
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:32,417
How'd you get into the school?

1071
00:55:33,752 --> 00:55:35,003
Door was open.

1072
00:55:35,087 --> 00:55:36,880
Which door?

1073
00:55:36,922 --> 00:55:39,466
I don't know.
All I know is I did it.

1074
00:55:39,508 --> 00:55:41,385
Well, I don't believe you.

1075
00:55:41,426 --> 00:55:43,011
I have proof.

1076
00:55:55,315 --> 00:55:58,568
Aaah-a-a-aaah

1077
00:55:58,652 --> 00:56:02,322
Aaah-a-a-aaaah

1078
00:56:03,365 --> 00:56:05,867
Aaah-a-a-a-aaaah

1079
00:56:08,662 --> 00:56:09,579
Tracy?

1080
00:56:09,621 --> 00:56:11,039
Yes?

1081
00:56:11,039 --> 00:56:13,000
Looks like today's your lucky day.

1082
00:56:13,083 --> 00:56:14,292
You're off the hook.

1083
00:56:14,376 --> 00:56:17,004
Tammy here has confessed.

1084
00:56:27,305 --> 00:56:29,850
I told you.

1085
00:56:29,933 --> 00:56:30,976
I told you.

1086
00:56:31,018 --> 00:56:33,061
You're gonna pay for my poster!

1087
00:56:33,145 --> 00:56:34,229
OK, easy, now, now,

1088
00:56:34,313 --> 00:56:35,188
quit while you're ahead,

1089
00:56:35,272 --> 00:56:36,732
will you, Tracy?
Just run along.

1090
00:56:36,773 --> 00:56:38,233
Back to class.

1091
00:56:38,275 --> 00:56:40,360
The rest of
the day was unbearable.

1092
00:56:40,444 --> 00:56:43,739
I kept smelling Linda
on my clothes and my fingers,

1093
00:56:43,822 --> 00:56:46,325
and I just couldn't wait
to get out of there.

1094
00:56:48,452 --> 00:56:50,704
I wanted everything to be perfect

1095
00:56:50,746 --> 00:56:52,205
that afternoon at the motel.

1096
00:56:52,289 --> 00:56:53,665
So I decided to give myself

1097
00:56:53,749 --> 00:56:55,959
a little time to prepare
during eighth period.

1098
00:56:56,001 --> 00:56:57,627
Pop quiz, everybody.

1099
00:56:59,171 --> 00:57:01,590
Put your stuff away.
Come on, no whining.

1100
00:57:01,631 --> 00:57:03,633
If you've done your reading,
this should be an easy one.

1101
00:57:05,385 --> 00:57:07,304
I'd have exactly 48 minutes

1102
00:57:07,387 --> 00:57:08,430
to make all the arrangements.

1103
00:57:08,513 --> 00:57:09,639
If you finish early,
just sit quietly

1104
00:57:09,723 --> 00:57:12,309
and check your work.
I'll be right back.

1105
00:58:27,092 --> 00:58:29,553
OK, everybody.
Pass 'em forward.

1106
00:58:29,594 --> 00:58:31,972
Stephanie, put
your pen down. Stop.

1107
00:58:33,098 --> 00:58:34,891
All right, see you
all on Wednesday.

1108
00:58:34,975 --> 00:58:36,727
Don't forget to vote tomorrow.

1109
00:59:15,557 --> 00:59:17,392
Linda.

1110
00:59:19,645 --> 00:59:21,396
Linda.

1111
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:27,653
Linda!

1112
00:59:35,869 --> 00:59:37,412
Linda!

1113
00:59:38,705 --> 00:59:40,707
Linda.

1114
00:59:47,631 --> 00:59:49,758
Ow!

1115
00:59:50,801 --> 00:59:55,013
Ow. Jesus.

1116
00:59:55,097 --> 00:59:57,891
Oh, fuck.

1117
01:00:05,649 --> 01:00:07,234
Hi. You've reached the Novotnys.

1118
01:00:07,275 --> 01:00:09,194
We're not around, but
we'll call you back real soon.

1119
01:00:09,236 --> 01:00:11,154
Have a nice day.

1120
01:00:11,238 --> 01:00:13,490
Hey, Linda, it's me.

1121
01:00:13,532 --> 01:00:14,950
Are you there? Pick up.

1122
01:00:15,033 --> 01:00:19,621
Um, OK, well,
it's, uh, it's 4:32,

1123
01:00:19,705 --> 01:00:24,751
and, uh, I came by at 3:25,
like we said,

1124
01:00:24,835 --> 01:00:27,754
and, uh, I waited
there, but, um,

1125
01:00:27,838 --> 01:00:31,341
you weren't there, so, so now

1126
01:00:31,425 --> 01:00:34,261
I'm at... at the place
that we talked about,

1127
01:00:34,302 --> 01:00:37,222
suite 246,

1128
01:00:37,305 --> 01:00:41,768
and I'm here.
Everything's all set,

1129
01:00:41,852 --> 01:00:45,188
so, uh, hope you get here soon.

1130
01:00:45,272 --> 01:00:47,441
OK. Bye-bye.

1131
01:00:52,946 --> 01:00:55,866
I don't get it.
I just don't get it.

1132
01:00:55,907 --> 01:00:58,285
What you have against
your mother and me,

1133
01:00:58,327 --> 01:01:01,747
against your brother Paul,
is completely beyond me.

1134
01:01:01,830 --> 01:01:03,707
Your mother's extremely upset,

1135
01:01:03,749 --> 01:01:05,625
she's at the end of her rope.

1136
01:01:05,667 --> 01:01:08,128
Your behavior keeps
getting crazier and crazier

1137
01:01:08,211 --> 01:01:09,963
and wilder and wilder.

1138
01:01:10,047 --> 01:01:11,715
Who knows what the hell else
you're doing out there

1139
01:01:11,798 --> 01:01:14,634
that we don't even know about.

1140
01:01:14,676 --> 01:01:16,720
We just had a long conversation

1141
01:01:16,803 --> 01:01:18,638
with Walt Hendricks.

1142
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:21,600
Just got off the phone
with him at his home.

1143
01:01:21,642 --> 01:01:23,727
You know he doesn't
want you back at Carver.

1144
01:01:23,810 --> 01:01:26,855
He's fed up with you.
Fed up,

1145
01:01:26,938 --> 01:01:27,814
and I don't blame him.

1146
01:01:27,898 --> 01:01:30,025
- Dick, Dick.
- What?

1147
01:01:30,108 --> 01:01:31,401
Tammy, your father and I

1148
01:01:31,443 --> 01:01:32,361
have been talking,

1149
01:01:32,402 --> 01:01:34,237
and we've come to
a decision that we...

1150
01:01:34,321 --> 01:01:36,531
You're going
to Immaculate Heart.

1151
01:01:36,573 --> 01:01:38,367
That's where you belong.

1152
01:01:38,450 --> 01:01:41,995
Maybe the nuns will be able
to straighten you out.

1153
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:44,998
Is that funny?
You think it's funny?

1154
01:03:12,377 --> 01:03:14,171
OK.

1155
01:04:03,053 --> 01:04:04,554
Dear Lord Jesus,

1156
01:04:04,638 --> 01:04:07,224
I do not often speak with You
and ask for things,

1157
01:04:07,265 --> 01:04:08,809
but now I really must insist

1158
01:04:08,892 --> 01:04:10,727
that You help me
win the election tomorrow,

1159
01:04:10,769 --> 01:04:13,146
because I deserve it
and Paul Metzler doesn't,

1160
01:04:13,188 --> 01:04:15,107
as You well know.

1161
01:04:15,148 --> 01:04:16,900
I realize that
it was Your divine hand

1162
01:04:16,984 --> 01:04:18,443
that disqualifiied Tammy Metzler,

1163
01:04:18,527 --> 01:04:21,321
and now I'm asking
that You go that one last mile

1164
01:04:21,363 --> 01:04:23,824
and make sure to put me
in offiice where I belong

1165
01:04:23,907 --> 01:04:25,742
so that I may carry out
Your will on Earth

1166
01:04:25,826 --> 01:04:28,787
as it is in heaven. Amen.

1167
01:04:28,870 --> 01:04:29,913
Dear God,

1168
01:04:29,997 --> 01:04:31,373
I know I don't believe in You,

1169
01:04:31,456 --> 01:04:33,125
but since I'll be starting
Catholic school soon,

1170
01:04:33,208 --> 01:04:35,210
I thought I should
at least practice.

1171
01:04:35,252 --> 01:04:37,671
Let's see, what do I want?

1172
01:04:37,754 --> 01:04:40,048
I want Lisa to realize
what a bitch she is

1173
01:04:40,132 --> 01:04:41,842
and feel really bad and apologize

1174
01:04:41,925 --> 01:04:43,093
for how she hurt me

1175
01:04:43,176 --> 01:04:45,137
and know how much
I still love her.

1176
01:04:45,220 --> 01:04:47,639
In spite of everything,
I still want Paul

1177
01:04:47,723 --> 01:04:48,724
to win the election tomorrow,

1178
01:04:48,807 --> 01:04:52,102
not that cunt Tracy.
Oh, and I also want

1179
01:04:52,185 --> 01:04:54,104
a really expensive
pair ofleather pants,

1180
01:04:54,146 --> 01:04:55,564
and someday I want to be

1181
01:04:55,605 --> 01:04:59,568
really good friends
with Madonna. Love, Tammy.

1182
01:04:59,651 --> 01:05:01,236
Dear God, thank You

1183
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:02,446
for all Your blessings.

1184
01:05:02,529 --> 01:05:03,989
You've given me so many things,

1185
01:05:04,072 --> 01:05:07,451
like good health,
nice parents, a nice truck,

1186
01:05:07,534 --> 01:05:09,369
and what I'm told
is a large penis,

1187
01:05:09,453 --> 01:05:11,079
and I'm very grateful.

1188
01:05:11,121 --> 01:05:13,165
But I sure am worried
about Tammy.

1189
01:05:13,248 --> 01:05:14,916
In my heart
I still can't believe

1190
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,335
she tore down my posters,

1191
01:05:16,376 --> 01:05:19,171
but sometimes she does
get so weird and angry.

1192
01:05:19,254 --> 01:05:21,548
Please help her
be a happier person

1193
01:05:21,631 --> 01:05:23,216
because she's
so smart and sensitive

1194
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:25,260
and I love her so much.

1195
01:05:25,344 --> 01:05:28,263
Also, I'm nervous
about the election tomorrow

1196
01:05:28,347 --> 01:05:30,307
and I guess
I want to win and all,

1197
01:05:30,390 --> 01:05:32,559
but I know that's
totally up to You.

1198
01:05:32,601 --> 01:05:34,478
You'll decide
who the best person is

1199
01:05:34,519 --> 01:05:37,606
and I'll accept it,
and forgive me for my sins,

1200
01:05:37,648 --> 01:05:41,026
whatever they may be. Amen.

1201
01:05:46,698 --> 01:05:48,950
Linda never
came home that night.

1202
01:05:49,034 --> 01:05:51,745
I know, because
I spent 10 hours

1203
01:05:51,787 --> 01:05:53,955
waiting outside her house.

1204
01:06:08,261 --> 01:06:09,971
Oh, God.

1205
01:06:40,210 --> 01:06:41,670
On election day,

1206
01:06:41,753 --> 01:06:43,422
my mom and I got up really early,

1207
01:06:43,505 --> 01:06:47,050
and together we
customized 480 cupcakes.

1208
01:06:52,681 --> 01:06:54,558
Good morning, Mr. M.

1209
01:06:58,145 --> 01:07:00,772
Looks like you could
use a cupcake.

1210
01:07:08,530 --> 01:07:10,157
Hey, what happened to your eye?

1211
01:07:14,786 --> 01:07:16,163
Are you OK?

1212
01:07:16,246 --> 01:07:17,205
" Mr. McAllister,

1213
01:07:18,498 --> 01:07:20,625
Mr. McAllister, somebody
tore down my posters.

1214
01:07:20,709 --> 01:07:22,878
It's not fair, it's not fair.

1215
01:07:22,919 --> 01:07:25,797
Can I have an 'A'?
Can I have a recommendation?

1216
01:07:25,881 --> 01:07:27,883
Can I, can I?"

1217
01:07:27,966 --> 01:07:29,843
Fuck them.

1218
01:07:50,072 --> 01:07:51,615
Hi. You've reached the Novotnys.

1219
01:07:51,657 --> 01:07:53,575
We're not around, but we'll
call you back real soon.

1220
01:07:53,659 --> 01:07:55,869
Have a nice day.

1221
01:07:55,952 --> 01:07:59,498
Why did you do that?
I trusted you completely.

1222
01:07:59,539 --> 01:08:01,458
And you ruined my life,
do you know that?

1223
01:08:01,541 --> 01:08:04,378
Do you realize that?
Huh? Doyou?

1224
01:08:04,461 --> 01:08:06,713
You ruined Diane's life...
You ruined my life,

1225
01:08:06,797 --> 01:08:09,424
is that what you wanted?

1226
01:08:09,466 --> 01:08:13,512
I'm sorry... I'm sorry,
I'm just... I'm going nuts here,

1227
01:08:13,595 --> 01:08:16,723
and I really think we should talk.

1228
01:08:16,765 --> 01:08:20,185
It'sJim. I love you.

1229
01:08:26,441 --> 01:08:28,151
Attention, everyone.

1230
01:08:28,193 --> 01:08:29,569
We have an important announcement

1231
01:08:29,653 --> 01:08:32,823
from our principal,
Dr. Hendricks.

1232
01:08:35,033 --> 01:08:37,244
Good morning, students.

1233
01:08:37,327 --> 01:08:39,997
It, uh, behooves me to inform you

1234
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:42,040
ofan important change
in today's election.

1235
01:08:42,124 --> 01:08:44,376
Effective this morning
sophomore Tammy Metzler

1236
01:08:44,459 --> 01:08:46,211
has been... Metzler has been

1237
01:08:46,294 --> 01:08:48,755
determined ineligible,
I repeat, ineligible

1238
01:08:48,797 --> 01:08:50,340
for S.G.A. president.

1239
01:08:50,382 --> 01:08:52,092
All other candidates
are eligible.

1240
01:08:52,134 --> 01:08:55,220
You may, uh,
vote for any of those,

1241
01:08:55,303 --> 01:08:57,306
but not Tammy Metzler.

1242
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:00,600
When the time
came to cast ourvotes,

1243
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:02,853
I stood in line
just like everyone else.

1244
01:09:02,894 --> 01:09:03,812
Hi, Tracy.

1245
01:09:03,854 --> 01:09:05,647
Tracy Enid Flick.

1246
01:09:05,731 --> 01:09:06,690
I know.

1247
01:09:07,816 --> 01:09:09,568
Thankyou.

1248
01:09:20,454 --> 01:09:21,997
Ready, Phil?

1249
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:23,248
Yeah, ready.

1250
01:09:31,006 --> 01:09:32,549
Thanks, Phil.

1251
01:09:36,470 --> 01:09:38,180
Oh, hey, Tracy.

1252
01:09:38,221 --> 01:09:39,431
Hi, Paul.

1253
01:09:39,514 --> 01:09:41,391
Isn't this exciting?

1254
01:09:41,475 --> 01:09:42,517
Mm-hmm.

1255
01:09:42,601 --> 01:09:44,978
Well, good luck.

1256
01:09:45,062 --> 01:09:47,439
Thanks, Paul. You, too.

1257
01:09:47,481 --> 01:09:49,775
Oh, thanks!

1258
01:09:55,572 --> 01:09:57,199
It's so weird.

1259
01:09:57,240 --> 01:09:59,534
Do people always just
vote for themselves?

1260
01:09:59,618 --> 01:10:02,496
'Cause looking at
my own name on the ballot

1261
01:10:02,579 --> 01:10:04,956
I just... I don't know,

1262
01:10:04,998 --> 01:10:08,043
I just felt like it's not right
to vote foryourself.

1263
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:26,687
Ok, Mr. M.

1264
01:10:27,896 --> 01:10:30,816
All right. So...

1265
01:10:30,857 --> 01:10:32,275
let's start counting.

1266
01:10:32,317 --> 01:10:35,612
OK, well, as the election
committee chairman,

1267
01:10:35,696 --> 01:10:36,738
I'll do the first count.

1268
01:10:36,780 --> 01:10:38,323
And then you can do
the second count,

1269
01:10:38,365 --> 01:10:39,825
you know, for
the 2 independent counts.

1270
01:10:39,866 --> 01:10:42,327
Fine. So do your count.

1271
01:10:42,411 --> 01:10:44,746
Start with president,
and I'll be right back.

1272
01:10:44,788 --> 01:10:47,666
You have the key, Mr. McAllister.

1273
01:10:50,669 --> 01:10:52,963
Right.

1274
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:07,602
Are you OK, Mr. McAllister?

1275
01:11:07,686 --> 01:11:09,813
Yeah. What happened to your eye?

1276
01:11:09,896 --> 01:11:12,441
I'm fiine!
It's just a bee sting.

1277
01:11:12,524 --> 01:11:14,860
A simple little
everyday bee sting.

1278
01:11:14,901 --> 01:11:17,738
Some people can get stung,
it's no big deal.

1279
01:11:17,821 --> 01:11:19,781
Me... I swell up.

1280
01:11:19,823 --> 01:11:22,326
There's not much time left
until eighth period.

1281
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:24,870
I have other things
going on, too, you know.

1282
01:11:24,953 --> 01:11:28,915
Yeah. OK. We know.

1283
01:11:28,999 --> 01:11:31,001
All right.
I'll be right back.

1284
01:11:34,838 --> 01:11:36,882
Hi. You've reached the Novotnys.

1285
01:11:36,923 --> 01:11:38,717
We're not around, but we'll
call you back real soon.

1286
01:11:38,759 --> 01:11:39,843
Have a nice day.

1287
01:11:41,261 --> 01:11:42,763
Uh, it's me again.

1288
01:11:42,846 --> 01:11:45,932
I'm sorry for all
the messages, but, uh...

1289
01:11:46,016 --> 01:11:47,517
Linda, if I could
just hear your voice.

1290
01:11:47,601 --> 01:11:49,478
If you'd only acknowledge that I...

1291
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:51,396
What do you want, Jim?

1292
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:52,981
You're there.

1293
01:11:53,065 --> 01:11:56,276
Yeah, I'm here.

1294
01:11:56,318 --> 01:11:57,235
Linda, I love you.

1295
01:11:58,278 --> 01:12:00,906
Don't say that.
You know it's not true.

1296
01:12:00,947 --> 01:12:03,033
It's the only true thing
I know anymore.

1297
01:12:03,116 --> 01:12:06,036
We made a mistake.
Let's not make it worse.

1298
01:12:06,078 --> 01:12:08,622
A mistake?
That was no mistake!

1299
01:12:08,705 --> 01:12:11,333
I was lonely.
You took advantage.

1300
01:12:11,375 --> 01:12:15,587
Me?! I took advantage of you?

1301
01:12:15,671 --> 01:12:17,964
You hugged me! You kissed me!
You're the one who...

1302
01:12:25,180 --> 01:12:26,765
Hey, Mr. M, big day, huh?

1303
01:12:26,848 --> 01:12:28,600
Not now, Paul.

1304
01:12:33,563 --> 01:12:34,481
What have y ou got?

1305
01:12:34,523 --> 01:12:36,942
Well, I'm not supposed to tell.

1306
01:12:37,025 --> 01:12:38,860
Not until you've counted, too.

1307
01:12:38,944 --> 01:12:39,945
We're each supposed to make

1308
01:12:39,987 --> 01:12:41,071
an independent count.

1309
01:12:41,113 --> 01:12:42,447
You're kidding, right?

1310
01:12:42,531 --> 01:12:44,157
Well, I thought
those were the rules,

1311
01:12:44,241 --> 01:12:45,117
Mr. McAllister.

1312
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:47,035
If they've changed
in anyway, I can...

1313
01:12:47,077 --> 01:12:48,745
Larry, we're not electing
the fucking pope here.

1314
01:12:48,787 --> 01:12:50,497
Just tell me who won.

1315
01:12:55,961 --> 01:12:57,337
It's a squeaker, Mr. M.

1316
01:12:57,421 --> 01:13:00,257
I've got Tracy by a vote.

1317
01:13:00,298 --> 01:13:01,717
Just one vote.

1318
01:13:09,433 --> 01:13:10,851
Mr. M?

1319
01:13:13,103 --> 01:13:14,104
All right.

1320
01:13:15,939 --> 01:13:16,815
OK.

1321
01:13:16,898 --> 01:13:21,361
Well, guess I better do my count.

1322
01:14:15,707 --> 01:14:17,542
Yay!

1323
01:14:17,626 --> 01:14:19,961
Yay!

1324
01:14:24,424 --> 01:14:26,009
Yay!

1325
01:14:29,304 --> 01:14:32,099
I was at the end of
my count when it happened.

1326
01:14:32,182 --> 01:14:35,936
I'd come up with exactly
the same numbers as Larry:

1327
01:14:36,019 --> 01:14:38,605
256 to 257.

1328
01:14:38,689 --> 01:14:41,358
Tracy had won the election
by a single vote.

1329
01:14:44,569 --> 01:14:47,447
I was about to announce
my tally when...

1330
01:14:54,579 --> 01:14:58,041
the sight of Tracy
at that moment affected me

1331
01:14:58,083 --> 01:14:59,960
in a way I can't fully explain.

1332
01:15:00,002 --> 01:15:03,046
Part of it was that she was spying.

1333
01:15:03,130 --> 01:15:06,133
But mostly it was her face.

1334
01:15:09,261 --> 01:15:12,848
Who knew how high
she would climb in life?

1335
01:15:12,931 --> 01:15:16,184
How many people would suffer
because of her?

1336
01:15:16,268 --> 01:15:18,437
I had to stop her...

1337
01:15:18,478 --> 01:15:20,564
now.

1338
01:15:50,761 --> 01:15:52,137
Larry?

1339
01:15:52,179 --> 01:15:54,181
Yeah?

1340
01:15:54,264 --> 01:15:56,516
I think we have a problem.

1341
01:15:56,558 --> 01:15:59,770
253, 254, and 255.

1342
01:15:59,853 --> 01:16:01,355
Yep, I get the same as you, Jim.

1343
01:16:01,438 --> 01:16:03,231
Looks like Paul's
our next president.

1344
01:16:03,273 --> 01:16:04,775
No way!

1345
01:16:04,816 --> 01:16:06,193
It doesn't make sense.

1346
01:16:06,276 --> 01:16:08,612
Well, sorry, Larry,
but my fiigures work out

1347
01:16:08,695 --> 01:16:10,197
exactly the same
as Mr. McAllister's.

1348
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:14,534
I get, uh, 256 for Paul,
255 forTracy.

1349
01:16:14,618 --> 01:16:17,663
And 290 disregards, right?

1350
01:16:17,746 --> 01:16:18,705
If you say so.

1351
01:16:18,789 --> 01:16:20,666
Mostly Tammy fans,
if you can believe it.

1352
01:16:20,707 --> 01:16:22,084
See? It doesn't add up.

1353
01:16:22,125 --> 01:16:25,420
There were 801 ballots,
but 803 people voted.

1354
01:16:25,462 --> 01:16:26,630
Well, there must
be 2 votes missing.

1355
01:16:26,713 --> 01:16:27,839
Check the register.

1356
01:16:27,881 --> 01:16:29,883
He's right. 2 people must
have pocketed their ballots.

1357
01:16:29,966 --> 01:16:31,510
Usually there's more.

1358
01:16:31,593 --> 01:16:35,222
But they were there.
I counted 803 votes.

1359
01:16:35,305 --> 01:16:37,599
It happens, Larry.
People make mistakes.

1360
01:16:37,641 --> 01:16:39,184
I didn't make a mistake.

1361
01:16:39,226 --> 01:16:41,395
Every vote was there
when you sat down.

1362
01:16:41,478 --> 01:16:43,981
Easy, Falch. I don't
like where you're going.

1363
01:16:44,064 --> 01:16:45,357
I'm sorry, Dr. Hendricks,

1364
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:47,442
but every vote
was accounted for.

1365
01:16:47,526 --> 01:16:48,944
Falch, that's enough.

1366
01:16:48,986 --> 01:16:51,196
End of story.

1367
01:17:11,299 --> 01:17:12,509
Paul?

1368
01:17:12,551 --> 01:17:15,554
I just want to let you know
that no matter what happens

1369
01:17:15,637 --> 01:17:16,596
and how this turns out,

1370
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:18,724
you've run a really great campaign.

1371
01:17:18,807 --> 01:17:20,309
Good luck.

1372
01:17:20,350 --> 01:17:22,894
Well, thanks, Tracy.
You, too.

1373
01:17:22,978 --> 01:17:25,063
I'm just glad it's over.

1374
01:17:26,857 --> 01:17:28,317
If we can just get started.

1375
01:17:28,358 --> 01:17:30,861
People. People.

1376
01:17:30,944 --> 01:17:32,446
As soon as the winners
are announced,

1377
01:17:32,529 --> 01:17:34,239
we can all go home, OK?

1378
01:17:34,281 --> 01:17:37,200
Some contests are...

1379
01:17:37,284 --> 01:17:40,370
are so well-fought
that it seems unfair

1380
01:17:40,454 --> 01:17:41,538
for someone to win...

1381
01:17:41,621 --> 01:17:44,958
Act surprised.
Walk slowly to the podium.

1382
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:48,337
Be modest. Thank them
for this incredible honor.

1383
01:17:48,420 --> 01:17:50,589
They're all highly qualifiied

1384
01:17:50,672 --> 01:17:55,093
and embody the, uh,
integrity that we expect

1385
01:17:55,177 --> 01:17:57,387
from the school leadership.

1386
01:17:57,471 --> 01:17:59,222
That said, the whole point
of an election

1387
01:17:59,264 --> 01:18:01,725
is to chose a winner,
and that you have done.

1388
01:18:01,767 --> 01:18:04,144
We'll begin with president.

1389
01:18:04,186 --> 01:18:06,188
I'djust like to add

1390
01:18:06,271 --> 01:18:08,315
that this was
an extraordinarily close race.

1391
01:18:10,275 --> 01:18:12,778
It is my pleasure
to announce the next president

1392
01:18:12,819 --> 01:18:15,238
of George Washington Carver
High School...

1393
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:17,741
Paul Metzler.

1394
01:18:30,253 --> 01:18:32,089
Jeez, you guys, thanks.

1395
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:36,134
Wow! Thanks.

1396
01:18:36,176 --> 01:18:37,844
I promise to do my best

1397
01:18:37,928 --> 01:18:42,015
and do a really good job
and be a good president.

1398
01:18:42,099 --> 01:18:44,267
I just want to thank,
uh, Lisa Flanagan

1399
01:18:44,351 --> 01:18:45,602
for being a super campaign manager.

1400
01:18:45,644 --> 01:18:48,605
I'd also like to say...

1401
01:19:26,727 --> 01:19:28,478
It's Mr. M.

1402
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:31,440
Yes, over there. Yeah, come on.

1403
01:19:34,860 --> 01:19:37,154
Wow, Mr. M.
This is so wild.

1404
01:19:37,195 --> 01:19:38,739
We were just here, uh, you know,

1405
01:19:38,822 --> 01:19:40,198
celebrating my victory,
and you're here.

1406
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:41,616
This is incredible.
This is great.

1407
01:19:41,700 --> 01:19:43,076
Well, these are my parents.

1408
01:19:43,118 --> 01:19:44,244
Hi, Dick Metzler.

1409
01:19:44,328 --> 01:19:45,203
Jim McAllister.

1410
01:19:45,287 --> 01:19:46,580
- Jo Metzler.
- How do you do?

1411
01:19:46,663 --> 01:19:48,123
Paul just thinks
the world ofyou.

1412
01:19:48,165 --> 01:19:49,124
I mean, you should hear him.

1413
01:19:49,166 --> 01:19:50,417
He goes on and on and on.

1414
01:19:50,459 --> 01:19:51,376
Yeah, apparently
you've really

1415
01:19:51,460 --> 01:19:52,669
come behind him,
really helped him out

1416
01:19:52,753 --> 01:19:53,879
with that student
council thing and all.

1417
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:56,381
Oh, well... well, Paul
doesn't need any help from me.

1418
01:19:56,465 --> 01:19:58,592
He's... He's going places.
You should be very proud.

1419
01:19:58,675 --> 01:19:59,551
Oh, we are.

1420
01:19:59,635 --> 01:20:01,303
Hey, look, you're all alone.

1421
01:20:01,386 --> 01:20:02,721
Why don't you come
over and join us?

1422
01:20:02,763 --> 01:20:03,680
Yeah. Yeah, come on.

1423
01:20:03,722 --> 01:20:05,349
Oh, I'm just fiinishing up here.

1424
01:20:05,432 --> 01:20:06,725
I've gotta get home.

1425
01:20:06,892 --> 01:20:08,101
Oh, well, uh,

1426
01:20:08,185 --> 01:20:11,271
why don't you guys
go sit down, and, uh...

1427
01:20:11,355 --> 01:20:13,106
you know, I'll catch up
with you in a minute.

1428
01:20:13,148 --> 01:20:15,025
I'm going to talk to Mr. M
about some important stuff,

1429
01:20:15,067 --> 01:20:15,984
all right?

1430
01:20:16,026 --> 01:20:17,319
All right.
That sounds great.

1431
01:20:17,361 --> 01:20:19,237
- Hey, sure nice to meet you.
- Great to meet you.

1432
01:20:19,279 --> 01:20:20,781
- Pleasure.
- So nice, and thank you.

1433
01:20:20,864 --> 01:20:22,199
You bet.

1434
01:20:26,078 --> 01:20:27,663
So, Mr. M, I was starting
to think about,

1435
01:20:27,746 --> 01:20:29,790
you know, some ideas
for what we could do.

1436
01:20:29,873 --> 01:20:31,500
I was thinking
it would be cool

1437
01:20:31,583 --> 01:20:32,501
to have a carnival.

1438
01:20:32,542 --> 01:20:34,086
You know, with rides and stuff.

1439
01:20:34,169 --> 01:20:36,254
And it could be for,
like, muscular dystrophy.

1440
01:20:36,338 --> 01:20:39,424
And then on Halloween,
a haunted house.

1441
01:20:39,508 --> 01:20:41,176
You know, a really
good haunted house,

1442
01:20:41,259 --> 01:20:42,511
not those cheesy bad ones.

1443
01:20:42,594 --> 01:20:43,637
You know, I mean,

1444
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:45,514
this one would be super-scary.

1445
01:20:45,597 --> 01:20:47,307
And then for home coming,

1446
01:20:47,391 --> 01:20:48,934
well, you know
how last year's theme

1447
01:20:48,976 --> 01:20:51,395
was " Heaven On Earth"?
Well, this year...

1448
01:20:51,478 --> 01:20:55,023
Paul, we'll have plenty of
time to talk about this later.

1449
01:20:55,107 --> 01:20:57,651
A whole year, in fact.

1450
01:20:57,734 --> 01:21:00,112
But right now, I'djust...

1451
01:21:00,195 --> 01:21:02,280
I need to fiinish my pie,

1452
01:21:02,364 --> 01:21:04,241
go on home.

1453
01:21:04,324 --> 01:21:07,494
Yeah, OK. Sorry.

1454
01:21:07,536 --> 01:21:10,414
Uh, Mr. M,
just one more thing.

1455
01:21:10,497 --> 01:21:14,001
So, uh, do you think
Tracy's gonna be OK?

1456
01:21:14,042 --> 01:21:16,378
I mean, I saw her face
after the assembly.

1457
01:21:16,461 --> 01:21:18,672
It looked like she was
taking it pretty hard.

1458
01:21:18,755 --> 01:21:21,091
Don't worry about Tracy.

1459
01:21:21,174 --> 01:21:23,885
She'll be fiine.

1460
01:21:36,815 --> 01:21:38,567
Oh, sweetheart.

1461
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:44,239
Oh, baby. Baby.

1462
01:21:44,281 --> 01:21:46,033
Oh, baby.

1463
01:21:46,116 --> 01:21:48,201
Take one of my pills.

1464
01:21:48,285 --> 01:21:51,079
You'll feel better.

1465
01:21:51,163 --> 01:21:53,123
Here.

1466
01:21:56,251 --> 01:21:59,838
Come on, baby. Come on.

1467
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:03,508
Lie down. Lie down.

1468
01:22:03,592 --> 01:22:06,720
That's a good girl.
Lie down.

1469
01:22:06,803 --> 01:22:09,431
Good girl.

1470
01:22:09,514 --> 01:22:11,391
That's... That's it.

1471
01:22:11,433 --> 01:22:13,101
That's it, baby.

1472
01:22:13,143 --> 01:22:15,395
That's it, honey.

1473
01:22:19,733 --> 01:22:22,819
Maybe you needed
more posters, honey.

1474
01:22:22,903 --> 01:22:26,031
Or if you'djust
taken my suggestions

1475
01:22:26,114 --> 01:22:27,824
about your speech.

1476
01:22:27,866 --> 01:22:30,160
I don't know.

1477
01:22:30,243 --> 01:22:32,120
We'll fiigure it out.

1478
01:22:43,340 --> 01:22:45,175
Diane.

1479
01:22:45,258 --> 01:22:48,512
I... I made a mistake and I...

1480
01:22:56,019 --> 01:22:58,146
Did you want the same room?

1481
01:22:59,982 --> 01:23:01,608
Yeah, OK.

1482
01:23:28,176 --> 01:23:30,053
It's a beautiful day

1483
01:23:30,137 --> 01:23:32,014
The next day, I woke up

1484
01:23:32,055 --> 01:23:34,141
resolved to get
my life back on track.

1485
01:23:34,224 --> 01:23:37,102
The way I saw it, Diane's
kicking me out of the house

1486
01:23:37,185 --> 01:23:38,270
had been a good thing,

1487
01:23:38,353 --> 01:23:39,604
a wake-up call.

1488
01:23:39,688 --> 01:23:42,691
It wasn't a setback.
It was an opportunity.

1489
01:23:42,733 --> 01:23:44,693
I fiigured we just
needed a little time

1490
01:23:44,776 --> 01:23:46,445
to work things out.

1491
01:23:46,528 --> 01:23:48,697
The election was behind me,

1492
01:23:48,780 --> 01:23:50,949
and the worst was over.

1493
01:23:51,033 --> 01:23:53,118
After all, what harm
had really been done?

1494
01:23:53,160 --> 01:23:54,953
Nobody was dead.

1495
01:24:00,167 --> 01:24:01,084
Jim?
Jim?!

1496
01:24:01,126 --> 01:24:02,044
Yeah.

1497
01:24:02,085 --> 01:24:03,587
Walt wants to seeyou.

1498
01:24:03,670 --> 01:24:05,714
OK, thanks.

1499
01:24:16,642 --> 01:24:18,518
You r... rang?

1500
01:24:21,605 --> 01:24:22,981
Mr. McAllister,

1501
01:24:23,065 --> 01:24:25,525
I hope you can help us
clear something up.

1502
01:25:02,854 --> 01:25:04,106
- Yo?
- Pierdo.

1503
01:25:04,189 --> 01:25:05,983
- Tu?
- Pierdes.

1504
01:25:06,066 --> 01:25:07,776
El, ella, usted?

1505
01:25:07,859 --> 01:25:08,735
Pierde.

1506
01:25:08,819 --> 01:25:09,987
Nosotros?

1507
01:25:10,070 --> 01:25:11,571
Pierdemos.

1508
01:25:11,655 --> 01:25:12,990
Gracias.

1509
01:25:15,534 --> 01:25:17,411
Seor Presidente.

1510
01:25:17,452 --> 01:25:21,039
Quieren verte enla ofiicina.

1511
01:25:21,123 --> 01:25:23,041
Huh?

1512
01:25:24,084 --> 01:25:25,460
Dr. Hendricks?

1513
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:30,757
Uh, come on in, son.
We have something...

1514
01:25:30,799 --> 01:25:33,885
hard we have to tell you.

1515
01:25:33,927 --> 01:25:34,845
Is it about Tammy?

1516
01:25:34,886 --> 01:25:36,263
It's about the election.

1517
01:25:39,725 --> 01:25:42,561
After Paul
got the bad news,

1518
01:25:42,602 --> 01:25:44,604
Walt asked for a few minutes
alone with me.

1519
01:25:44,646 --> 01:25:47,190
It was very simple, really.

1520
01:25:47,232 --> 01:25:49,151
I offered my resignation,

1521
01:25:49,192 --> 01:25:51,653
and he accepted.

1522
01:25:51,737 --> 01:25:55,198
Very quietly, it was
all over for Jim McAllister

1523
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:56,658
at Carver High.

1524
01:26:00,329 --> 01:26:02,789
Suddenly everyone knew who I was...

1525
01:26:02,873 --> 01:26:04,249
that corrupt teacher

1526
01:26:04,333 --> 01:26:06,960
who had tried to crush
the dreams of an innocent girl.

1527
01:26:07,002 --> 01:26:09,880
Overnight, all the good things
I had ever done in my life

1528
01:26:09,963 --> 01:26:12,257
evaporated.

1529
01:26:12,341 --> 01:26:14,843
Soon the wire services
picked up on the story.

1530
01:26:14,885 --> 01:26:18,221
It was the kind of absurd news item
people E-mail each other

1531
01:26:18,305 --> 01:26:21,266
or post on the bulletin
board at work.

1532
01:26:21,350 --> 01:26:25,228
To top it all off, Diane had
started divorce proceedings.

1533
01:26:25,312 --> 01:26:28,273
She was completely unforgiving
about the thing with Linda.

1534
01:26:28,357 --> 01:26:30,901
In the end, she took
almost everything,

1535
01:26:30,984 --> 01:26:32,694
including the house.

1536
01:26:32,778 --> 01:26:34,780
I got the car.

1537
01:26:50,295 --> 01:26:52,130
Then one day,

1538
01:26:52,172 --> 01:26:54,216
I realized it was time
to get out of Omaha

1539
01:26:54,257 --> 01:26:55,884
and move on.

1540
01:27:01,890 --> 01:27:03,266
Senior year was great.

1541
01:27:03,350 --> 01:27:07,187
Sure, I didn't get to
play ball or be president,

1542
01:27:07,229 --> 01:27:10,399
but I got elected
homecoming king and prom king.

1543
01:27:10,440 --> 01:27:12,818
I got into Nebraska,
like I wanted,

1544
01:27:12,901 --> 01:27:14,236
and early rushed PhiDelts.

1545
01:27:14,277 --> 01:27:16,071
And at the end of the year,
me and my buddies

1546
01:27:16,154 --> 01:27:19,282
threw a bitchin' Mexican party
down at the cement plant.

1547
01:27:19,366 --> 01:27:21,576
Shit, that was a good party.

1548
01:27:21,702 --> 01:27:25,122
The only really bad thing
about senior year was Lisa.

1549
01:27:25,205 --> 01:27:26,790
Right before Christmas,
she dumped me.

1550
01:27:26,873 --> 01:27:29,042
One minute, she's
totally in love with me,

1551
01:27:29,126 --> 01:27:32,879
and then boom, she goes after
my football buddy Randy.

1552
01:27:32,963 --> 01:27:35,257
Sometimes I wonder
what would have happened

1553
01:27:35,340 --> 01:27:37,134
if I had actually won
the election.

1554
01:27:37,217 --> 01:27:38,760
Maybe my whole life
would be different.

1555
01:27:38,844 --> 01:27:41,680
Like I might never
have gone to Yosemite

1556
01:27:41,722 --> 01:27:43,432
with Greg and Travis.

1557
01:27:43,473 --> 01:27:45,434
Or maybe I'd be dead.

1558
01:27:45,517 --> 01:27:48,353
Alleluia

1559
01:27:48,437 --> 01:27:50,355
Catholic school
was great.

1560
01:27:52,149 --> 01:27:55,402
I mean, the teachers
kind of sucked,

1561
01:27:55,444 --> 01:27:57,863
and they were supposedly
way more strict.

1562
01:27:57,904 --> 01:28:00,240
But you could get away
with murder.

1563
01:28:00,324 --> 01:28:03,160
The best thing
about Immaculate Heart

1564
01:28:03,201 --> 01:28:05,329
was meeting Jennifer.

1565
01:28:05,370 --> 01:28:09,166
JenniferJuniper

1566
01:28:09,207 --> 01:28:12,294
Lives up on the hill

1567
01:28:12,377 --> 01:28:16,256
JenniferJuniper

1568
01:28:16,340 --> 01:28:18,550
Sitting very still

1569
01:28:19,635 --> 01:28:21,511
Is she sleeping

1570
01:28:21,553 --> 01:28:22,929
Jennifer and I
are soul mates

1571
01:28:23,013 --> 01:28:26,099
and we're never, ever,
ever going to be apart.

1572
01:28:26,183 --> 01:28:30,312
JenniferJuniper

1573
01:28:30,354 --> 01:28:33,523
Order! Order. Order!

1574
01:28:33,607 --> 01:28:35,275
Senior year was
very productive for me.

1575
01:28:35,359 --> 01:28:36,860
Let's vote on this issue.

1576
01:28:36,943 --> 01:28:38,695
On top of a very successful
student council year,

1577
01:28:38,779 --> 01:28:40,906
I was in the top
seventh percentile

1578
01:28:40,989 --> 01:28:42,157
of my graduating class.

1579
01:28:42,199 --> 01:28:43,241
Opposed?

1580
01:28:43,325 --> 01:28:44,534
And I got into Georgetown,
like I wanted,

1581
01:28:44,576 --> 01:28:46,953
with scholarships.

1582
01:28:47,037 --> 01:28:48,372
Approved.

1583
01:28:50,082 --> 01:28:53,168
But sometimes I got lonely,
and I'd think about Dave.

1584
01:28:53,210 --> 01:28:54,711
I missed our talks.

1585
01:28:54,795 --> 01:28:57,130
Maybe it could have
worked out between us.

1586
01:28:57,214 --> 01:28:58,298
I don't know.

1587
01:28:58,382 --> 01:29:01,218
I wonder what he's doing now.

1588
01:29:01,301 --> 01:29:05,222
Maybe he fiinally
fiinished his novel.

1589
01:29:05,305 --> 01:29:09,559
But you know, even with
all my my riad accomplishments

1590
01:29:09,601 --> 01:29:11,186
and bright future,

1591
01:29:11,269 --> 01:29:14,022
somehow I just didn't feel
the way you're supposed to feel.

1592
01:29:14,106 --> 01:29:16,024
Everybody else seemed so happy,

1593
01:29:16,108 --> 01:29:20,362
planning big parties and
signing each other's yearbooks.

1594
01:29:20,445 --> 01:29:22,489
Hardly anybody signed mine.

1595
01:29:22,572 --> 01:29:24,408
You'd think as
student body president,

1596
01:29:24,491 --> 01:29:26,034
I'd be the one
surrounded by friends.

1597
01:29:26,118 --> 01:29:28,370
But it wasn't like that at all.

1598
01:29:32,040 --> 01:29:34,793
Brittany Blake Fillmore.

1599
01:29:34,876 --> 01:29:36,586
As far as
Mr. McAllister was concerned,

1600
01:29:36,670 --> 01:29:39,339
you might be surprised,
but I hardly thought about him

1601
01:29:39,423 --> 01:29:40,507
at all anymore.

1602
01:29:40,590 --> 01:29:43,343
Besides, nobody had heard
from him in a long time.

1603
01:29:43,427 --> 01:29:46,722
It was almost like he'd never
existed in the fiirst place.

1604
01:29:46,805 --> 01:29:49,433
Tracy Enid Flick.

1605
01:29:51,435 --> 01:29:53,770
When I got to Georgetown,

1606
01:29:53,854 --> 01:29:56,273
I thought I'd fiinally be
among people who were like me.

1607
01:29:56,356 --> 01:29:58,608
You know, smarter,
more ambitious people.

1608
01:29:58,650 --> 01:30:01,278
I was sure that fiinally
I'd make some true friends.

1609
01:30:02,696 --> 01:30:04,448
Excuse me!

1610
01:30:04,531 --> 01:30:06,533
Would you please be quiet?!

1611
01:30:06,616 --> 01:30:08,660
It wasn't like that at all.

1612
01:30:08,744 --> 01:30:10,495
A lot of them were just
spoiled little rich kids

1613
01:30:10,579 --> 01:30:13,081
who didn't know
how lucky they had it.

1614
01:30:13,165 --> 01:30:16,335
That's OK. I've come to
accept that very few people

1615
01:30:16,418 --> 01:30:18,086
are truly destined to be special,

1616
01:30:18,170 --> 01:30:19,880
and we're solo fliers.

1617
01:30:19,921 --> 01:30:22,090
I guess it really is
like Dave said,

1618
01:30:22,174 --> 01:30:25,218
"If you're gonna be great,
you've got to be lonely."

1619
01:30:29,556 --> 01:30:33,644
What happens to a man
when he loses everything?

1620
01:30:33,685 --> 01:30:35,937
Everything he's worked for.

1621
01:30:36,021 --> 01:30:39,983
Everything he believes in.

1622
01:30:40,067 --> 01:30:42,194
Driven from his home,

1623
01:30:42,277 --> 01:30:44,571
cast out of society,

1624
01:30:44,655 --> 01:30:46,573
how can he survive?

1625
01:30:46,657 --> 01:30:48,033
Where can he go?

1626
01:30:48,116 --> 01:30:50,994
Right this way.

1627
01:30:51,078 --> 01:30:52,663
New York City.

1628
01:31:01,630 --> 01:31:04,591
For centuries, people
have come to New York

1629
01:31:04,675 --> 01:31:08,011
seeking refuge from
their troubled lives.

1630
01:31:08,095 --> 01:31:11,598
Now I am one of them.

1631
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:13,558
Besides, I'd always dreamed
of living in New York.

1632
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:15,644
All that excitement and culture.

1633
01:31:15,727 --> 01:31:18,480
Living in the city brings
surprises all the time.

1634
01:31:18,522 --> 01:31:21,191
Once in a while, I even bump
into former students of mine

1635
01:31:21,233 --> 01:31:23,193
from Carver.

1636
01:31:23,276 --> 01:31:25,737
Oh, sure, my apartment's
a little smaller

1637
01:31:25,821 --> 01:31:27,406
than what I was used to
back in Omaha,

1638
01:31:27,489 --> 01:31:29,282
and the rent's pretty darn steep,

1639
01:31:29,366 --> 01:31:30,867
but it's got a lot of character.

1640
01:31:30,951 --> 01:31:32,703
And I'm cozy enough.

1641
01:31:35,664 --> 01:31:37,666
Besides, it's great
not needing a car.

1642
01:31:37,708 --> 01:31:40,627
And I get a lot of reading
done on the subway.

1643
01:31:40,711 --> 01:31:42,796
Some days I even walk to work.

1644
01:31:45,007 --> 01:31:47,843
The job market is
pretty tight in New York,

1645
01:31:47,926 --> 01:31:50,137
but after hunting around
for a while,

1646
01:31:50,178 --> 01:31:52,556
I fiinally landed a position
in the education department

1647
01:31:52,597 --> 01:31:54,725
at the Museum of Natural History.

1648
01:31:54,808 --> 01:31:57,686
That's right.
I'm teaching again.

1649
01:31:57,769 --> 01:32:01,064
When a school brings
its students to the museum

1650
01:32:01,148 --> 01:32:02,107
on a fiield trip,

1651
01:32:02,190 --> 01:32:04,067
there's a staffof
both volunteer docents

1652
01:32:04,151 --> 01:32:06,028
and trained educators like myself...

1653
01:32:06,069 --> 01:32:09,281
who pick up where
the classwork leaves off.

1654
01:32:09,323 --> 01:32:11,450
And I've started
seeing someone new.

1655
01:32:11,533 --> 01:32:13,452
Her name is Jillian.

1656
01:32:13,535 --> 01:32:16,204
She works at the museum, too,
in Signs and Signage.

1657
01:32:16,246 --> 01:32:18,874
She's really different
from Diane, and, I don't know,

1658
01:32:18,957 --> 01:32:21,209
I've never met anyone
quite like her.

1659
01:32:21,293 --> 01:32:23,920
She just got out of
a long relationship, too,

1660
01:32:24,004 --> 01:32:25,631
so we're trying
to take it slow.

1661
01:32:29,426 --> 01:32:31,887
You might ask if I ever
saw Tracy Flick again.

1662
01:32:31,928 --> 01:32:33,639
Well, I did.

1663
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:35,641
Just once.

1664
01:32:35,724 --> 01:32:40,687
I was down in Washington for
a museum educator's conference,

1665
01:32:40,771 --> 01:32:43,023
and I stayed an extra day
to do some sightseeing.

1666
01:32:45,567 --> 01:32:48,528
After an inspiring morning
on the Mall,

1667
01:32:48,570 --> 01:32:52,240
I was on my way to
the Holocaust Museum when...

1668
01:33:25,607 --> 01:33:27,734
I'll never know ifshe saw me.

1669
01:33:27,776 --> 01:33:29,319
Probably not.

1670
01:33:29,403 --> 01:33:31,780
But in that moment,
all the bad memories,

1671
01:33:31,863 --> 01:33:34,741
all the things I'd ever
wanted to say to her,

1672
01:33:34,825 --> 01:33:36,994
it all came flooding back.

1673
01:33:39,621 --> 01:33:41,665
My fiirst impulse
was to run over there,

1674
01:33:41,748 --> 01:33:42,958
pound on her window,

1675
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,293
and demand that she admit
she tore down those posters

1676
01:33:45,377 --> 01:33:48,547
and lied and cheated her way
into winning that election.

1677
01:33:48,630 --> 01:33:53,552
But, instead,
I just stood there.

1678
01:33:53,635 --> 01:33:58,056
And I suddenly realized
I wasn't angry at her anymore.

1679
01:33:58,140 --> 01:34:00,851
I just felt sorry for her.

1680
01:34:00,934 --> 01:34:02,978
I mean, when I think
about my new life

1681
01:34:03,061 --> 01:34:05,314
and all the exciting
things I'm doing,

1682
01:34:05,397 --> 01:34:08,108
and then I think about
what her life must be like...

1683
01:34:08,191 --> 01:34:10,694
probably still getting up
at 5:00 in the morning

1684
01:34:10,777 --> 01:34:13,030
to pursue her pathetic
little dreams...

1685
01:34:13,113 --> 01:34:15,615
it just makes me sad.

1686
01:34:15,699 --> 01:34:19,036
I mean where is she really
trying to get to anyway?

1687
01:34:19,119 --> 01:34:21,747
What is she doing in that limo?

1688
01:34:21,830 --> 01:34:25,000
Who the fuck does
she think she is?!

1689
01:34:33,425 --> 01:34:36,637
Hey, you! Hey!

1690
01:34:36,720 --> 01:34:38,764
You asshole!

1691
01:34:38,805 --> 01:34:41,058
But that's all
ancient history now.

1692
01:34:41,141 --> 01:34:43,518
I've got a whole new life.

1693
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:45,854
I mean, that's what's
great about America.

1694
01:34:45,937 --> 01:34:47,272
You can always start over.

1695
01:34:47,314 --> 01:34:49,483
So would that make this
an igneous rock

1696
01:34:49,524 --> 01:34:51,693
or a sedimentary rock?

1697
01:34:51,777 --> 01:34:53,487
What's the difference
between igneous

1698
01:34:53,528 --> 01:34:54,946
and sedimentary anyway?

1699
01:35:04,748 --> 01:35:07,167
Anybody?

1700
01:35:10,087 --> 01:35:12,756
I want to know
how love began

1701
01:35:12,839 --> 01:35:15,634
I want to go
to school again

1702
01:35:15,717 --> 01:35:18,845
If you'll be

1703
01:35:18,929 --> 01:35:21,807
The teacher

1704
01:35:21,890 --> 01:35:24,768
Long before
the school bells chime

1705
01:35:24,851 --> 01:35:28,355
I'll be there
ahead oftime

1706
01:35:28,438 --> 01:35:33,026
Just to see my teacher

1707
01:35:33,068 --> 01:35:36,279
Start right
from the fiirst of it

1708
01:35:36,321 --> 01:35:38,240
Don't miss a thing

1709
01:35:38,281 --> 01:35:39,449
I want to get

1710
01:35:39,533 --> 01:35:44,246
All the facts, then
I'll know what to do

1711
01:35:44,287 --> 01:35:48,709
When we graduate,
I'll hold you tight

1712
01:35:48,750 --> 01:35:50,961
Then you'll know
you taught me right

1713
01:35:51,003 --> 01:35:55,632
Teacher, teacher,
I'm in love with you

1714
01:36:02,764 --> 01:36:05,267
If you'll be

1715
01:36:05,350 --> 01:36:08,103
The teacher

1716
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:17,195
If you'll be

1717
01:36:17,237 --> 01:36:19,698
The teacher

1718
01:36:19,781 --> 01:36:23,160
Start right
from the first of it

1719
01:36:23,201 --> 01:36:24,661
Don't miss a thing

1720
01:36:24,745 --> 01:36:25,912
I want to get

1721
01:36:25,996 --> 01:36:30,834
All the facts, then
I'll know what to do

1722
01:36:30,917 --> 01:36:35,422
When we graduate,
I'll hold you tight

1723
01:36:35,464 --> 01:36:37,549
Then you'll know
you taught me right

1724
01:36:37,633 --> 01:36:39,176
Teacher, teacher

1725
01:36:39,259 --> 01:36:41,928
I'm in love with you
