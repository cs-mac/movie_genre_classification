1
00:00:29,997 --> 00:00:32,557
Hand over the milk money, Weaver.

2
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,470
I can't do that, Derek.

3
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,836
I'm not sure
you'll spend it on milk.

4
00:00:42,076 --> 00:00:44,010
That's me, Mitch Weaver.

5
00:00:44,078 --> 00:00:46,911
That's Sam, my lifelong best friend.

6
00:00:46,981 --> 00:00:50,883
I never had a dad growing up,
so Sam's dad Pops filled in a little.

7
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:53,943
He was a boxer, real tough guy.

8
00:00:54,021 --> 00:00:57,889
One thing to remember in life,
no matter where you go or what you do...

9
00:00:57,958 --> 00:01:00,654
don't take no crap from nobody.

10
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:03,891
I never liked the guy,
but he was right about not taking crap.

11
00:01:03,964 --> 00:01:07,058
Wow! My dad sure is great.

12
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:12,003
Hey, do you know where
he hides his guns?

13
00:01:12,073 --> 00:01:13,768
Don't worry.

14
00:01:17,044 --> 00:01:20,741
We planted the guns in the bully's desk
so he'd get in trouble.

15
00:01:20,815 --> 00:01:23,215
It wasn't me!

16
00:01:23,284 --> 00:01:27,118
Let me go!
They weren't mine!

17
00:01:27,188 --> 00:01:30,419
We always did stuff like that,
get back at people who messed with us.

18
00:01:30,491 --> 00:01:34,018
There was this crossing guard
used to grab all the kids' asses.

19
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:36,859
Back then people weren't on
the lookout for that kind of thing.

20
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:39,900
The only way to nail a guy like that
was to catch him red-handed.

21
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:41,958
That's where Super Glue came in.

22
00:01:42,036 --> 00:01:45,995
Look, everybody! Crossing guard's
grabbing 8-year-old's ass over here!

23
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:54,911
We really got back at
this ornery baby-sitter we didn't like.

24
00:01:56,884 --> 00:02:00,650
After all these years,
this picture still makes me horny.

25
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:03,884
I mean, wistful!
It makes me wistful.

26
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:07,257
When I was 16,
the saddest event of my life occurred.

27
00:02:07,328 --> 00:02:08,761
My mom died.

28
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:13,289
Everyone did their best to console me,
particularly Aunt Jenny.

29
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:16,097
It wasn't easy, because
I'm not comfortable expressing my...

30
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,661
What do you call them? Emotions?

31
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:21,503
Anyways, I learned to express myself
in other ways.

32
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:24,339
I started making little notes to myself.

33
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:26,072
Note to self.

34
00:02:26,147 --> 00:02:30,641
Remember, Aunt Jenny is your aunt.

35
00:02:30,718 --> 00:02:33,312
Then there was this character
we had to deal with.

36
00:02:33,387 --> 00:02:35,651
She thought just because she was
a meter maid...

37
00:02:35,723 --> 00:02:38,886
that she had the right to go around
giving everybody parking tickets.

38
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,291
That's where the popcorn
came in handy.

39
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:52,533
In high school, I still didn't take crap
from anyone, man or beast.

40
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:54,699
This Doberman would always chase us.

41
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:57,300
So we borrowed my cousin's
huge German shepherd...

42
00:02:57,378 --> 00:02:59,312
who also happens to be gay.

43
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:02,579
Taught that Doberman some humility.

44
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,213
Boy, those were the days.

45
00:03:05,286 --> 00:03:08,778
But then, something happened.
I grew up.

46
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:12,553
Okay, 132 Highfield Avenue
in three minutes.

47
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:14,821
I can make it.
I can make it.

48
00:03:17,131 --> 00:03:18,564
No!

49
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:33,445
Hi, there.
Thirty minutes or free, right?

50
00:03:33,514 --> 00:03:36,540
And you took 32 minutes.

51
00:03:36,617 --> 00:03:39,313
So close and yet so far.

52
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:42,480
Gimme a break. That free pizza
comes out of my paycheck.

53
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,854
That doesn't seem fair, does it?

54
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:50,223
Then the guy says,
"If you want the money for this pizza...

55
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:53,391
you tell Aldo and the rest
of those sweaty Italian fruits...

56
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:55,401
to come down
and get it from me themselves."

57
00:03:55,469 --> 00:04:00,634
Also, he started saying nasty things
about that Mussolini character.

58
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:05,008
The guy called.
I know you didn't make it on time.

59
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:08,276
None of the other pizza places have
the 30-minute thing anymore.

60
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:09,782
Can't we drop it?

61
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,751
You think we should drop
the 30-minute guarantee?

62
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,948
You think Aldo's should be
just like all the others?

63
00:04:17,191 --> 00:04:20,558
Mitch Weaver, you're not fit
to wear this shirt.

64
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,655
That's my Canadians jersey.

65
00:04:55,062 --> 00:04:57,326
You have anything in a 10-1/2 wide?

66
00:04:58,198 --> 00:05:00,063
Toni-Ann, what are you doing?

67
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:04,227
I've had it. Uncle Aldo called.
He told me he fired you.

68
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:09,140
That's your 14th job in the past
three months! I can't take it anymore!

69
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:12,303
Honey, I understand you're upset.

70
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:15,314
Maybe you'll feel better
after we have some dirty sex.

71
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:19,512
Forget it! I'm through
wasting my life with you.

72
00:05:19,586 --> 00:05:21,019
Good-bye!

73
00:05:21,088 --> 00:05:24,148
- What about the rest of my stuff?
- Your stuff?

74
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:26,158
There is no "your stuff."

75
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:28,786
I have paid for everything
in this apartment.

76
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:32,265
Wait a minute. That's not true.

77
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,426
I paid for the popcorn machine.

78
00:05:47,715 --> 00:05:49,478
What's up, fruity?

79
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:50,983
Hey, ass-bite.

80
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:55,682
By the looks of this popcorn machine, I
guess she tossed you out for good?

81
00:05:55,756 --> 00:05:57,348
Yep.

82
00:05:57,424 --> 00:05:59,619
Passed your car back there.

83
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:02,719
- It's a nasty flat, but I can fix it.
- Thanks, Sam.

84
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:06,493
I was wondering. Could I crash
with you and your dad for a while?

85
00:06:07,368 --> 00:06:11,634
No. I'm gonna turn away my best friend
so he's gotta sleep in his car. Come on.

86
00:06:14,475 --> 00:06:16,409
Hey, that's my shirt.

87
00:06:16,477 --> 00:06:18,809
You're wearing my shirt.

88
00:06:23,951 --> 00:06:25,384
Here you go.

89
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:27,283
No, that's all right.

90
00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:30,016
I was talking to somebody else
that's different than you.

91
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,326
Two, three, up.

92
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,265
Press those knees straight.

93
00:06:41,335 --> 00:06:43,667
And again. Take it down.

94
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,796
Two, three...

95
00:06:45,873 --> 00:06:47,363
and lift it up.

96
00:06:52,446 --> 00:06:55,176
- Pops, how you doin'?
- Pretty good, son.

97
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:58,548
But it'd be goin' a lot better
if you brought me a whore.

98
00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:00,246
I thought you couldn't...

99
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,914
I can't but...

100
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,959
I subscribe to this magazine
to give me a few ideas.

101
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:09,427
There's an article about home
stereo equipment, too. That's for you.

102
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:11,088
That's great.

103
00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:14,191
- I'll be right back, all right?
- Yeah.

104
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,873
Do me a favor.

105
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:23,910
Could you stay with him for a while?

106
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:25,535
What's the matter?

107
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,911
You know how I feel about your father.
I'm uncomfortable around him.

108
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:31,610
He's kind of... I don't know.

109
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:33,676
Creepy, you know?

110
00:07:33,754 --> 00:07:36,018
He creeps the hell out of me,
to tell you the truth.

111
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:37,818
He likes you.

112
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:41,486
I gotta call somebody
to borrow a jack.

113
00:07:41,562 --> 00:07:43,496
Stay with him for a while.

114
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:44,997
All right.

115
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:50,603
Feelin' okay, Mr. McKenna?

116
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:53,105
Don't worry about me.

117
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:56,802
I just want to thank you
for spending a little time with me.

118
00:07:56,877 --> 00:07:59,539
- Well, no problem.
- Yeah, yeah.

119
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:03,014
- I also want to say I'm sorry.
- Sorry for what?

120
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:06,814
For being a creepy old man.

121
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:09,185
I apologize, you rotten bastard!

122
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:13,192
- You say those things about me?
- Pops! Pops! Let go!

123
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:17,196
Get out of here, Sam!
I'll kill this bastard!

124
00:08:17,264 --> 00:08:20,427
I can still hear,
no matter how creepy I look.

125
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:24,096
- It's Mitch! Let go.
- All right, take him.

126
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:26,799
Everything's falling apart.

127
00:08:26,874 --> 00:08:28,933
Remember how things were
when we were young?

128
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,102
Yeah, it was great.

129
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:32,611
Yeah, it was.

130
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,170
I felt good about myself back then.

131
00:08:35,249 --> 00:08:39,049
If somebody messed with me, no problem.
I didn't take crap from anybody.

132
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:43,249
Now I'm in my 30s, I can't hold a job.
I go out with women I don't even like.

133
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:46,690
Worst of all, I take crap
from absolutely everybody.

134
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,389
Things could be worse.

135
00:08:49,463 --> 00:08:52,955
I could've got my nose bit off
by a Saigon whore.

136
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:01,674
You bastard!

137
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:06,471
I'm just messin' with you, Jimmy.
I saw you down there.

138
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:08,913
Get Jimmy a beer on me.

139
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:11,177
Okay. It's okay.

140
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,553
Wow, look at her.

141
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:16,851
Yeah. She's all yours, buddy.
Go get her.

142
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,861
Hi. How ya doin'?
I'm Sam McKenna.

143
00:09:34,474 --> 00:09:36,601
I live with my dad.

144
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:40,511
It appears Travis Cole
has bailed out the city once again...

145
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:44,608
coming up with the necessary funding
to save the Chelsea Opera House.

146
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:47,813
How could a man in my position
not step in and do his civic duty?

147
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:50,083
That opera house is part
of this city's heritage.

148
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:52,682
Heck, yes, I'm gonna keep it up
and running.

149
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:56,092
I love this city,
and as we all know...

150
00:09:56,163 --> 00:09:58,631
I love opera.

151
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:00,132
Right, Spunky?

152
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,034
A guy like Travis Cole
has a great life.

153
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,265
Why? Just because he's rich?

154
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:09,571
No. Because he doesn't take crap
from anybody.

155
00:10:09,643 --> 00:10:11,975
There are two kinds of people in this
world: those who get stomped on...

156
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:14,775
and those who do the stomping.

157
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:16,873
Where'd you come up
with that theory?

158
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,919
That famous guy said it.
What's his name?

159
00:10:19,987 --> 00:10:22,148
Yeah. Jesus.

160
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:23,883
Hi. I'm Mitch.

161
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:26,722
Hello, Mitch.

162
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:29,990
Maybe later you'll drop by the house.

163
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:32,327
You know, check out the hot tub.

164
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,835
- Hey, pal, beat it!
- Why don't you beat it?

165
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:39,702
The lady obviously isn't interested
in you, jerk-off! So get lost!

166
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:42,503
Maybe we should let the lady decide.

167
00:10:42,576 --> 00:10:44,840
- I think you should fight it out.
- Good idea.

168
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:46,674
- Great idea!
- Brilliant idea!

169
00:10:46,747 --> 00:10:50,274
- I love the idea.
- Terry, Jack, Mike, Rick.

170
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:54,218
No. My dumb friend needs me.
I gotta go.

171
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:02,528
Well, Mitch, looks like
we've got ourselves a fight.

172
00:11:02,596 --> 00:11:05,793
Great. It's fightin' time.
Can I be on their side?

173
00:11:07,868 --> 00:11:10,666
Looks like there's gonna be a brawl.
You playin' something good?

174
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:14,696
Hell, yeah!
Rolling Stones' "Street Fighting Man."

175
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:17,300
G-7!

176
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:20,909
You just hit G-8.

177
00:11:24,718 --> 00:11:26,447
Bring it on!

178
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:30,880
How come you get a pool cue?

179
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:35,957
Come on.
You fell right into my trap.

180
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:39,157
Sammy, bite 'em!
Bite 'em in the nose!

181
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:48,973
Note to self.
Learn to fight.

182
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:58,541
I wanna go over there and rip
their heads off, every one of them.

183
00:11:58,618 --> 00:12:03,988
That would probably work, since they're
so tired from beating us mercilessly.

184
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:07,458
But since we rented the cop uniforms,
let's try it my way, all right?

185
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:12,565
- Hey, dude, what's up?
- Neil, is that you?

186
00:12:12,632 --> 00:12:15,999
Yeah, it's me, Neil.

187
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:21,632
It's Jason. We just got back from
beating these guys. Messed 'em up good!

188
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:25,667
The whole time, this guy's lying there,
crying like a little girl.

189
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:28,772
- Wait, I'll get Terry.
- Don't get Terry. I mean...

190
00:12:28,849 --> 00:12:31,249
The reason I'm calling is this.

191
00:12:31,318 --> 00:12:35,049
There's these guys going around
to frat houses pretending to be cops.

192
00:12:35,122 --> 00:12:38,182
But they're not real cops.
They're fake cops.

193
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,658
They just robbed a bunch of stuff
from the Delta Psi house.

194
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:42,661
So don't be fooled, okay?

195
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:44,663
Sure thing.
Thanks for calling.

196
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:46,824
Okay, no problem, dude.

197
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:50,597
Now you go back to doing something
latently homoerotic, all right?

198
00:12:57,878 --> 00:13:02,008
Hello, real cops?
Yes, I'd like to register a complaint.

199
00:13:02,082 --> 00:13:04,915
We got a complaint about the noise.

200
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:07,112
Whatever you say, Officer.

201
00:13:08,088 --> 00:13:09,680
Officer down! We need backup!

202
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:22,227
- Okay, we'll take care of these two.
- You got it.

203
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,770
Hey, frat sisters, remember us?

204
00:13:27,707 --> 00:13:29,800
I'll take this one.

205
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:40,382
- I'll take the next one.
- All right, man.

206
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:51,291
That felt great, man,
getting back at those guys tonight.

207
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:53,958
I've got to admit, that was brilliant,
what you did.

208
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:55,968
You are the king of revenge.

209
00:13:56,036 --> 00:13:59,369
Pipe down! I'm trying to watch
these broads work out.

210
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:01,771
- You want another beer?
- Yeah.

211
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:06,345
Mitch, you wanna come over here?

212
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:08,404
I'm not falling for that one again.

213
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:13,750
- I think I'm having a heart attack.
- Not gonna work.

214
00:14:17,224 --> 00:14:21,251
Pops! You all right?

215
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:33,503
I'm gonna let him sleep.

216
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:36,736
Could you stay with him
while I find the doctor?

217
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:38,744
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

218
00:14:45,252 --> 00:14:47,049
I'm glad you came.

219
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,351
Hey, Mr. McKenna.
I'll go get Sam.

220
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:53,824
No, hold on.
There's something I want to tell you.

221
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:55,987
I'm gonna find Sam.

222
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:58,622
Mitch, sit your ass down!

223
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:05,534
It's embarrassing being physically
afraid of a hundred-year-old man...

224
00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:07,539
who just had a coronary...

225
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:09,541
so could we hurry this up?

226
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:11,873
I'm not doin' too well.

227
00:15:11,945 --> 00:15:15,210
So knowing that, I think
I better tell you this now.

228
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:19,051
- Tell me what?
- I'm your father.

229
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:28,252
You must be delirious,
because you're not my father.

230
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:31,422
I don't know who my father is,
but it's not you.

231
00:15:31,498 --> 00:15:33,159
Here, Mitch.

232
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,195
Look at the picture
in this locket.

233
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:44,065
Holy Lord!

234
00:15:44,144 --> 00:15:48,376
That's a picture of you and my mom
having sex!

235
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:51,542
God! Why would you show me that?

236
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:54,086
I'm sorry, son.

237
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:56,754
I figured you'd never believe me
unless I showed you that picture.

238
00:15:57,757 --> 00:16:02,057
I loved your mother as a friend, but it
wasn't true love. We both knew that.

239
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:07,498
Besides, back then they didn't have
these fancy birth control methods.

240
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:09,262
Like pullin' out.

241
00:16:09,336 --> 00:16:11,531
God!

242
00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:14,505
Stop sayin' dirty stuff for a second,
would you?

243
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:18,941
Does Sam know about this?

244
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:21,572
No. And I don't want you to tell him.

245
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:23,081
Why not?

246
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:27,714
I don't want him to feel
he's been lied to his entire life.

247
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:30,221
Down deep he's very sensitive.

248
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,224
Promise me you won't tell him.

249
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:34,590
I can't promise you.

250
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:36,595
Sam's got a right to know.

251
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,654
I'm gonna tell him.

252
00:16:38,732 --> 00:16:40,996
Hello. I'm Dr. Farthing.

253
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:43,126
Are you Mr. McKenna's son?

254
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:49,007
I gotta talk to Sam.

255
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:53,068
Mitch, don't tell him!
Don't you tell him!

256
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:56,138
Now, let me ask you.

257
00:16:56,216 --> 00:16:58,616
Are you a betting man?

258
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:00,846
I don't know. Sure.

259
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,253
If someone were taking bets on
your father's bout with death...

260
00:17:04,324 --> 00:17:07,452
I'd bet everything I own on death.

261
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:11,094
It's a good bet.
The odds are he'll probably die.

262
00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:15,026
Couldn't you have prepared him
for that?

263
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:17,035
Well...

264
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:20,095
kind of thought I did
with that betting analogy.

265
00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:22,266
What is wrong with my dad?

266
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:24,310
Your dad?

267
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:28,404
In a nut shell,
your dad needs a heart transplant.

268
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:32,941
Because of his age,
he's low priority on the donor's list.

269
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:36,614
Was your father a famous athlete
or rock star?

270
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:40,955
No. He was a boxer,
but he wasn't famous.

271
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:44,489
Sorry, no heart there.

272
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:47,590
But, for $600...

273
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:50,568
I could sell you
a fully-adjustable hospital bed.

274
00:17:50,637 --> 00:17:53,902
Are you crazy?
I don't need a bed.

275
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:58,705
Playing hardball, are you?
Okay, $550.

276
00:17:58,778 --> 00:18:00,939
I don't have to sit here
and listen to this!

277
00:18:01,014 --> 00:18:02,311
No, wait.

278
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:04,680
I can't believe this is happening.

279
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:07,743
Wait. Where're you goin'?
Your friend's leaving...

280
00:18:07,821 --> 00:18:10,585
Come back here. I can help him.

281
00:18:11,825 --> 00:18:14,157
Please, come back, sit down.

282
00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:19,757
I'm sorry.
I'm a compulsive gambler.

283
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:25,362
Now, I know there's nobody to blame
for this but myself.

284
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:29,101
I don't know. Maybe the Buffalo Bills,
or the Boston Red Sox or Mr. "T"...

285
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:30,608
or the Jets.

286
00:18:30,677 --> 00:18:34,374
Mr. "T"? Are you telling me
that you bet on the fight...

287
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,881
in Rocky III,
and you bet against Rocky?

288
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:40,044
Hindsight is 20/20, my friend.

289
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,247
The point is, I'm in trouble.

290
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:47,251
Deep trouble. Which could be good
for Mr. McKenna's father.

291
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:51,696
There is a way I can get his name bumped
to the top of the list to get his heart.

292
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:53,789
How?

293
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,868
If you pay me $50,000.

294
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:02,407
- Did you say $50,000?
- No.

295
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:05,933
I whispered $50,000.
I need it in two weeks.

296
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:10,608
This is awful, but I've given these
bookies practically everything I have.

297
00:19:14,087 --> 00:19:18,217
When I was young, my mom used to tell me
that the lights we see in the sky...

298
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:21,226
are from stars that burned out
millions of years ago.

299
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:23,421
It's like life.

300
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:27,865
Something can be one way you think
all your life...

301
00:19:27,934 --> 00:19:30,664
and in reality
it's completely different.

302
00:19:31,604 --> 00:19:32,935
Yeah.

303
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:35,907
I'm gonna kill you, asshole!

304
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:39,001
Sam, are you pissing
off the side of the building?

305
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:40,511
Sort of.

306
00:19:41,381 --> 00:19:47,149
You know, I'm going crazy here
over Pops. He's gonna die!

307
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,950
He's not gonna die. You're gonna get
the money and get him a heart.

308
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:52,958
$50,000 in two weeks?
Come on!

309
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:56,427
My sister Carol said she'd send
two grand. Where will I get the rest?

310
00:19:56,496 --> 00:20:00,193
- Are you gonna not try?
- Of course I'm gonna try!

311
00:20:01,768 --> 00:20:05,101
What if I got a job?

312
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:07,298
Maybe I could pay this guy off
in installments.

313
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:10,604
Yes. Now you're talkin'.
I'll help you every step of the way.

314
00:20:11,978 --> 00:20:13,673
Thanks, buddy.

315
00:20:16,516 --> 00:20:17,949
You little bastards!

316
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:19,951
That was a hell of a piss.

317
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:23,355
Look at the "help wanted" section.

318
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:26,950
I'm looking at the "buy and sell" ads.
Maybe we can sell something.

319
00:20:27,026 --> 00:20:29,859
- Just look for a job.
- All right, all right!

320
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:31,453
Movie line comin' up.

321
00:20:39,138 --> 00:20:42,164
How's that lookin', baby?

322
00:20:54,854 --> 00:20:57,015
He was supposed to keep drivin'.

323
00:20:59,726 --> 00:21:03,059
To start with,
the bottom stair is a roundover.

324
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:05,791
It does a 180 into the newel post.

325
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:10,461
The bannister has a 90 degree easement
and dies into the newel post.

326
00:21:10,536 --> 00:21:13,198
Ninety degrees.

327
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:15,935
- That's gonna be a problem.
- What's the problem?

328
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:20,173
We lied on our resumes.
We know nothing about construction.

329
00:21:20,246 --> 00:21:21,941
When is lunch?

330
00:21:22,015 --> 00:21:23,448
You're fired.

331
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:27,552
Ass-bite, you sure this is a good idea?

332
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,589
Hell, yeah.
It's 50 bucks for eatin' brownies.

333
00:21:30,657 --> 00:21:33,683
They are safe, but there is a chance
of some side effects...

334
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:38,754
including mild itching, nausea, chills,
hallucinations and rashes.

335
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:41,391
These are good?
Aren't they good?

336
00:21:47,774 --> 00:21:50,242
I think I feel a slight itch.

337
00:21:51,511 --> 00:21:53,138
No, maybe not.

338
00:21:54,013 --> 00:21:56,174
Could be my imagination.

339
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:13,364
We eat the pig and
then together we burn.

340
00:22:15,401 --> 00:22:19,235
- What you talkin' about, Satan?
- Come with me.

341
00:22:19,305 --> 00:22:23,401
You belong with me.

342
00:22:23,476 --> 00:22:25,410
Burn!

343
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:37,182
The hell with that job.
Who wants to be itchy anyway?

344
00:22:37,256 --> 00:22:40,657
All right. Everybody line up.

345
00:22:40,727 --> 00:22:43,491
Don't be dummies.
Just get in line.

346
00:22:43,563 --> 00:22:44,996
That's fine.

347
00:22:45,064 --> 00:22:49,592
Gentlemen, members of the national
office are coming here tonight...

348
00:22:49,669 --> 00:22:52,695
for their annual inspection
of this theater.

349
00:22:52,772 --> 00:22:56,299
Right now, I'm going to explain to you
my managing style...

350
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:59,641
for the benefit of the new guys.

351
00:23:01,848 --> 00:23:04,476
So there you are, tubby.

352
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,814
You look like a bucket of lard
on a bad day.

353
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:08,444
You baby gorilla.

354
00:23:08,521 --> 00:23:10,682
Why don't you work the zoo
and stop bothering people?

355
00:23:10,757 --> 00:23:13,453
Got a call yesterday
from Baskin Robbins.

356
00:23:13,526 --> 00:23:17,826
They said that they're down
to only five flavors.

357
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:20,127
You're swelling up as I talk to you.

358
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:22,292
Look at you. How's this?
How's it doin'?

359
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:27,232
Hello, ice cream.
Having a good time running around?

360
00:23:29,876 --> 00:23:33,812
Are you laughing 'cause I called your
friend a fat pig? Think that's funny?

361
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,974
I was laughing earlier
when you were talking to his belly.

362
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:40,712
Why don't you get a horse and live
in the mountains? Don't bother anybody.

363
00:23:40,787 --> 00:23:42,880
You've got a personality
like a dead moth.

364
00:23:42,955 --> 00:23:46,015
Okay, the fun's over.

365
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:48,993
Anybody messes this thing up
for me tonight is through.

366
00:23:49,061 --> 00:23:52,553
Not only are you fired,
your life is over.

367
00:23:52,632 --> 00:23:57,194
I'll see to it you never work again, and
wind up tearing tickets off in Kuwait.

368
00:23:59,005 --> 00:24:00,438
Everybody's sucking sand.

369
00:24:00,506 --> 00:24:02,667
Nobody messes up, understand me?

370
00:24:02,742 --> 00:24:05,438
Don't mess up!

371
00:24:09,382 --> 00:24:11,350
That guy's gonna be our boss?

372
00:24:11,417 --> 00:24:15,148
After a speech like that, how does
he expect us not to screw him over?

373
00:24:15,221 --> 00:24:18,281
Every one of us said the same thing
our first day working for Hamilton...

374
00:24:18,357 --> 00:24:20,291
only nobody does anything.

375
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:23,726
Trust me, this isn't just talk.
Nobody screws me over like that.

376
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:26,560
- Me, neither.
- I can't help you. I need this job.

377
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:29,624
But if you really screw over Hamilton,
I'll give you ten bucks.

378
00:24:29,702 --> 00:24:32,432
Mark me down for $20.

379
00:24:32,505 --> 00:24:34,837
Mr. Witherspoon.

380
00:24:34,907 --> 00:24:37,307
Class operation, Hamilton.
Good job.

381
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:40,812
Thank you.
Let me get you some refreshments.

382
00:24:42,448 --> 00:24:44,040
Okay, we're all set.

383
00:24:44,116 --> 00:24:46,914
One, two, three. Look away!

384
00:24:55,561 --> 00:24:57,085
Look, an alien.

385
00:24:57,163 --> 00:25:00,223
Yeah, we better have sex
with each other.

386
00:25:06,072 --> 00:25:09,667
Note to self.
Sam just looked at the screen.

387
00:25:09,742 --> 00:25:12,370
No, I didn't.
I was just making sure the reel had...

388
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:18,178
- This alien looks like a hot guy.
- Right. We better have sex with him.

389
00:25:18,251 --> 00:25:21,948
Gimme that.
It took long enough, you dummy.

390
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:35,266
Hamilton, you're through.

391
00:25:37,069 --> 00:25:40,971
That was amazing.
You should do that stuff for a living.

392
00:25:44,176 --> 00:25:45,609
Sam, tonight...

393
00:25:45,678 --> 00:25:48,670
we made a wad of cash for doing
something that comes natural to us.

394
00:25:48,748 --> 00:25:50,443
Revenge.

395
00:25:50,516 --> 00:25:53,110
We should open
a "revenge for hire" business.

396
00:25:53,185 --> 00:25:55,881
I've never heard of
a "revenge for hire" business.

397
00:25:55,955 --> 00:25:57,889
Exactly. We'd be the first.

398
00:25:57,957 --> 00:26:00,949
With every genius business idea,
there's got to be a first.

399
00:26:01,027 --> 00:26:04,519
Like the guy who first thought
of delivering pizza to people's houses.

400
00:26:04,597 --> 00:26:06,531
Or the guy who invented crack.

401
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,625
Who's gonna hire us?

402
00:26:10,703 --> 00:26:13,297
I have a feeling people are going
to pay us a lot of money...

403
00:26:13,372 --> 00:26:15,306
to do their dirty work.

404
00:26:18,377 --> 00:26:21,437
Okay, let's get a few things
straight here.

405
00:26:21,514 --> 00:26:26,008
As long as the rent's on time,
you don't wreck the place, we're okay.

406
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:27,677
If not...

407
00:26:28,688 --> 00:26:30,679
I punch you in the stomach.

408
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:34,783
If that ever comes up,
that Sam's department.

409
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,158
Yeah, that's my department.

410
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:42,063
Good.

411
00:26:42,134 --> 00:26:43,726
Good luck to you.

412
00:26:43,803 --> 00:26:45,236
Thanks.

413
00:26:48,808 --> 00:26:50,241
Mildred!

414
00:26:52,178 --> 00:26:53,645
Wait up.

415
00:26:53,713 --> 00:26:56,079
- Hi, Rich.
- Hi, Mildred.

416
00:26:56,148 --> 00:26:59,584
I guess you forgot my name.
It's not Mildred, it's Kathy.

417
00:26:59,652 --> 00:27:02,177
No, I didn't forget.
You never told me, so I just guessed.

418
00:27:02,254 --> 00:27:05,815
That's a novel approach.

419
00:27:05,891 --> 00:27:09,452
So, how'd the fight with
those fraternity guys turn out?

420
00:27:09,528 --> 00:27:11,120
We kicked their ass!

421
00:27:11,197 --> 00:27:14,394
I was punching one guy
and kicking this other guy.

422
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:16,833
I threw one dude right through
a plate glass window.

423
00:27:16,902 --> 00:27:20,167
- Really?
- Sort of, except the exact opposite.

424
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:23,572
Don't you think it's silly
for grown men to fight?

425
00:27:23,643 --> 00:27:27,010
Did you see the movie Kickboxer?
They're all grown men.

426
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:30,748
Are we going to your apartment now?

427
00:27:32,051 --> 00:27:35,282
I'm going back to work.

428
00:27:35,354 --> 00:27:37,948
- Where do you work?
- Right there.

429
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:42,525
Phillips Motors!
Are you a dirty car salesman?

430
00:27:42,595 --> 00:27:46,292
- No. I'm a dirty accountant.
- Hey, Kathy!

431
00:27:46,365 --> 00:27:51,564
Break's over, sweetheart.
Get your ass in here! Now!

432
00:27:51,637 --> 00:27:54,731
- Who's that dude?
- Anton Phillips, the owner.

433
00:27:54,807 --> 00:27:59,039
- Does he always talk to you like that?
- Well, yeah.

434
00:27:59,111 --> 00:28:02,638
But he's doing a live TV commercial
tomorrow, so he's worse than usual.

435
00:28:03,983 --> 00:28:07,350
Anyway, it was nice
seeing you again, Mitch.

436
00:28:09,889 --> 00:28:12,323
Live TV commercial?

437
00:28:13,325 --> 00:28:16,260
Okay, settle down, prostitutes.

438
00:28:16,328 --> 00:28:21,129
Understand that you each get $20,
and this requires no sex.

439
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,691
No sex at all...

440
00:28:23,769 --> 00:28:25,964
regardless of what
this character tells you.

441
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:29,132
- What's the matter with you?
- What's the matter?

442
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:33,042
We spend most of the money
my sister sent for Pops on this office.

443
00:28:33,112 --> 00:28:36,138
And now we're wasting the rest of it
so you can impress some girl?

444
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:39,241
No. This isn't for her.

445
00:28:39,318 --> 00:28:42,947
This is so we can get a free commercial
for Dirty Work on live television.

446
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:50,859
And in five, four, three, two.

447
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:53,694
Hello, everyone.
I'm Anton Phillips...

448
00:28:53,766 --> 00:28:55,961
President of Phillips Motors.

449
00:28:56,035 --> 00:28:59,004
We'll return in a moment
to the Channel 11 Movie Matinee...

450
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:04,737
but I'm here with you live to show you
some great luxury automobiles.

451
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:08,143
Like this one-year-old
Cadillac Deville...

452
00:29:08,214 --> 00:29:10,409
priced right at $36,000.

453
00:29:10,483 --> 00:29:13,247
Fully loaded:
V-8 engine, standard.

454
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:16,652
Shock-resistant CD player, standard.

455
00:29:16,722 --> 00:29:18,849
- The trunk looks kinda small.
- This is live!

456
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:22,519
I'm on live T...
Trunk's fine.

457
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:25,962
As you can see, friends,
it's not small.

458
00:29:26,031 --> 00:29:28,431
It's a big trunk.
I'll show you right here.

459
00:29:28,501 --> 00:29:30,594
You got a dead hooker in the trunk!

460
00:29:30,669 --> 00:29:32,534
No! It can't be.

461
00:29:32,605 --> 00:29:35,506
- It was. It was a dead hooker.
- It wasn't a dead hooker!

462
00:29:35,574 --> 00:29:38,839
- I know a dead hooker when I see one.
- What's happening?

463
00:29:38,911 --> 00:29:42,369
- Come on down.
- Here's another dead hooker!

464
00:29:42,448 --> 00:29:43,915
What?

465
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:46,242
My goodness!

466
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:50,948
I've never seen so many dead hookers
in all my life.

467
00:29:51,023 --> 00:29:53,218
Lord knows I have.

468
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:57,353
- I can remember a time...
- Look, there's Mitch on TV.

469
00:29:57,429 --> 00:30:00,125
Yeah, there's Mitch.

470
00:30:00,199 --> 00:30:04,295
And there's the Saigon whore...

471
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:07,237
that bit my nose off!

472
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:12,109
These are nice cars.
These are luxury automobiles.

473
00:30:12,178 --> 00:30:15,875
I've got a whole place.
They're fully loaded.

474
00:30:15,948 --> 00:30:18,280
They're loaded
with dead hookers.

475
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:21,581
You're seein' things.
Don't shoot this.

476
00:30:21,654 --> 00:30:24,714
- This is not part of the commercial.
- Some jerk making your life miserable?

477
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:28,817
You want revenge? Call 555-0187
and let us do your dirty work.

478
00:30:28,894 --> 00:30:30,452
And we're clear.

479
00:30:32,231 --> 00:30:33,994
Wake up, slut!

480
00:30:34,066 --> 00:30:35,795
Well, well, well.

481
00:30:35,868 --> 00:30:39,031
We meet again.
Nose biter!

482
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:41,732
Time to pay the fiddler, whore!

483
00:30:43,876 --> 00:30:47,004
That was great.
Let's get out of here.

484
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,174
Nurse, record vital signs, please.

485
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:54,651
If that stethoscope is as freezing cold
as it was yesterday...

486
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,847
I'm gonna shove it
right up your ass!

487
00:30:56,922 --> 00:30:58,947
Vital signs normal.

488
00:31:04,263 --> 00:31:05,696
Hey, Pops!

489
00:31:05,764 --> 00:31:08,961
Sam! Mitch!
What are you two fruits up to?

490
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:12,026
You should've seen it.
We just did this cool thing on TV...

491
00:31:12,104 --> 00:31:14,504
that should really help
our revenge business.

492
00:31:14,573 --> 00:31:16,200
We found our calling.

493
00:31:16,275 --> 00:31:20,803
Looking back, I must've been your age
when I found my calling.

494
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,848
So you became a boxer?

495
00:31:22,915 --> 00:31:25,782
That's when I started working
in stag films.

496
00:31:27,086 --> 00:31:29,020
I'm gonna find Dr. Farthing.

497
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:34,287
Hey, look, Pops.

498
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,692
- I gotta tell you something.
- What?

499
00:31:36,762 --> 00:31:39,788
I've made up my mind.
I'm going to tell Sam.

500
00:31:39,865 --> 00:31:42,333
Or not!

501
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:45,370
I'd appreciate it
if you didn't tell Sam.

502
00:31:45,437 --> 00:31:47,564
He might react badly.

503
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:51,576
I wouldn't want anything to break up
our relationship before I die.

504
00:31:52,745 --> 00:31:56,010
Okay, I won't tell him.

505
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:57,639
Yeah.

506
00:32:04,523 --> 00:32:08,152
Note to self.
Forget about fathering children.

507
00:32:11,931 --> 00:32:15,594
- Any bleeding?
- Only when I sit down.

508
00:32:15,668 --> 00:32:17,602
What happened to your arm?

509
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:21,401
I'm not sure. It's either
from sleeping on it the wrong way...

510
00:32:21,473 --> 00:32:24,601
or from bookmakers throwing me out
of a speeding car.

511
00:32:24,677 --> 00:32:27,942
- Did you get the 50 grand?
- Not yet.

512
00:32:28,013 --> 00:32:32,245
If we get some money in two weeks,
could we pay the rest in installments?

513
00:32:32,318 --> 00:32:35,719
No. Well, there are nine days left.

514
00:32:35,788 --> 00:32:39,690
Might I suggest kidnapping the child
of a celebrity?

515
00:32:39,758 --> 00:32:44,855
You know, I realize Pops isn't your
favorite person in the whole world...

516
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:48,229
so I appreciate how hard
you're trying to help him out.

517
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,892
That's nice.

518
00:32:49,969 --> 00:32:51,903
I've gotta tell you something.

519
00:32:51,971 --> 00:32:55,873
Your father is not only your father.

520
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:00,235
He's also...

521
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:04,146
He's also a good man.

522
00:33:04,216 --> 00:33:06,150
Your father is a good man.

523
00:33:06,218 --> 00:33:07,879
Yeah.

524
00:33:07,953 --> 00:33:09,443
Mitch, you know...

525
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:14,755
I wanted to...

526
00:33:15,694 --> 00:33:18,219
You're my best friend, man.

527
00:33:18,297 --> 00:33:20,527
Keep your distance there, Liberace.

528
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:22,032
I was just...

529
00:33:23,736 --> 00:33:26,204
Hey, Kathy!
I'm glad to see you.

530
00:33:26,271 --> 00:33:30,173
Did you really think you were helping me
with that disgusting stunt?

531
00:33:30,242 --> 00:33:33,609
Hey, maybe you don't realize it,
but that disgusting stunt...

532
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,147
was this idiot's way of saying
he likes you.

533
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:40,610
I'm gonna stand over there.

534
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,751
The guy deserved it.

535
00:33:43,822 --> 00:33:46,950
Because of what you did,
Anton had to sell the dealership.

536
00:33:47,026 --> 00:33:49,859
Now I'm out of a job.
Did I deserve that?

537
00:33:49,928 --> 00:33:53,455
No, but you shouldn't work for a guy
who treats you bad anyway.

538
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:58,162
That is a decision for me to make,
not you or your awful company.

539
00:33:58,237 --> 00:34:00,797
Putting prostitutes
in the trunks of cars?

540
00:34:00,873 --> 00:34:03,842
- That is so...
- Cool!

541
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:06,707
The dead hooker in the trunk thing
was the coolest thing ever.

542
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,941
Wow, Mitch, congratulations.

543
00:34:10,015 --> 00:34:13,007
Now you're famous for being a jerk.

544
00:34:13,085 --> 00:34:15,986
I wish some girl would look at me
the way she looks at you.

545
00:34:16,055 --> 00:34:17,989
What are you talking about?
She hates me.

546
00:34:18,057 --> 00:34:20,457
No, she's mad at you.
There's a difference.

547
00:34:20,526 --> 00:34:23,495
She's mad at you
because she likes you so much.

548
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:27,521
I'm short, not invisible.
Can I get a little help down here?

549
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,727
Heather, who works here,
is an abusive drunk.

550
00:34:30,803 --> 00:34:34,034
Calls me names. Hits me.
Your classic dwarf hater.

551
00:34:34,106 --> 00:34:36,040
Here she comes.

552
00:34:37,476 --> 00:34:39,410
Move over, short stuff.

553
00:34:40,712 --> 00:34:45,376
Hey, baby, you ever had a chick
with a beard before?

554
00:34:45,451 --> 00:34:47,851
I can't say that I have,
bearded broad.

555
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:51,219
Then, sugar, you haven't lived.

556
00:34:53,525 --> 00:34:56,824
Note to self.
I don't want to live.

557
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:00,198
I'll be in my trailer, honey.

558
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:04,201
If you want it, come and get it.

559
00:35:06,572 --> 00:35:09,040
Does that go for me, too?

560
00:35:10,309 --> 00:35:12,277
So can you help me?

561
00:35:12,344 --> 00:35:14,676
Yeah, we can help you.

562
00:35:35,968 --> 00:35:37,765
No beard.

563
00:35:37,836 --> 00:35:40,304
My problem is with
these guys next door.

564
00:35:40,372 --> 00:35:44,035
They drive around in their Porsche
90 miles an hour where my kids play...

565
00:35:44,109 --> 00:35:45,542
blasting their music.

566
00:35:45,611 --> 00:35:49,411
They have loud, wild parties
still going on when I get up for work.

567
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:52,006
- Sounds awful.
- It's unbearable.

568
00:35:52,084 --> 00:35:54,450
It's unbearable to live next door
to that house.

569
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:59,151
Then we'll make it unbearable
to live in that house.

570
00:36:05,931 --> 00:36:07,455
This should do it.

571
00:36:07,533 --> 00:36:10,593
Mitch, this is brutal.

572
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:12,637
We hide these fish
all over the house?

573
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:14,638
And they'll stink for days.

574
00:36:14,706 --> 00:36:16,765
Okay, let's go.

575
00:36:35,227 --> 00:36:37,161
Come on, quick.

576
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,398
My flight doesn't leave for an hour.

577
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,296
- Nice place you've got.
- Yeah, yeah.

578
00:36:51,143 --> 00:36:52,735
You want it?

579
00:36:52,811 --> 00:36:54,244
Check it out.

580
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,613
Looks good.

581
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:00,984
What's the problem?

582
00:37:01,954 --> 00:37:03,387
Smells like fish.

583
00:37:03,455 --> 00:37:05,685
What was that? Some sort of signal?

584
00:37:05,757 --> 00:37:07,725
Is that a signal?
You wearing a wire?

585
00:37:07,793 --> 00:37:10,023
No. It really does smell
like fish in here.

586
00:37:10,095 --> 00:37:12,222
You're a damn cop! That's it.

587
00:37:12,297 --> 00:37:14,765
Show these guys what we do to cops.

588
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:17,301
Say hello to the devil for me.

589
00:37:17,369 --> 00:37:18,802
Behind you!

590
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:23,740
I've been hit. Kill them!

591
00:37:23,809 --> 00:37:25,299
Kill them!

592
00:37:25,377 --> 00:37:28,813
Make your gun fight
like the devil himself!

593
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,247
Burn in hell, you bastards!

594
00:37:32,317 --> 00:37:35,377
Sweet Jesus! He got me.

595
00:37:35,454 --> 00:37:40,391
Mark, over there. Grab it.
I use it to cut firewood.

596
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,890
What's he using? You're killing me
with that chain saw!

597
00:37:49,468 --> 00:37:53,905
He took away my chain saw,
and now he's using it on me.

598
00:37:56,508 --> 00:37:59,341
My, God! Is that a hand grenade?

599
00:38:13,158 --> 00:38:14,591
Good Lord!

600
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:18,721
We gotta get out of here.
Will you come on?

601
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:30,032
That's it!
This noise has got to stop!

602
00:38:32,144 --> 00:38:35,443
My God.
I never asked you to do this.

603
00:38:35,514 --> 00:38:37,812
Ed, we gotta go.

604
00:38:37,883 --> 00:38:39,942
Could you pay us now?

605
00:38:40,018 --> 00:38:43,715
Four hundred bucks, and we need
$50,000 in six days?

606
00:38:43,789 --> 00:38:47,418
- We're not even close.
- I know we're not.

607
00:38:48,126 --> 00:38:50,219
There's a message.

608
00:38:50,295 --> 00:38:52,229
Maybe it's a job.

609
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:55,365
Hey, fatso. Fatso!

610
00:38:55,434 --> 00:38:59,234
It's me, Hamilton, your boss
from the movie theater.

611
00:38:59,304 --> 00:39:01,465
I saw that TV commercial you made.

612
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:05,909
Fat, fat, fat! When you sweat,
marbles come off your ass.

613
00:39:13,018 --> 00:39:15,009
Hello. Dirty Work.

614
00:39:16,555 --> 00:39:20,616
No, I can hear you fine.
It must be your phone.

615
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,418
Sure, we'll be right over.

616
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:35,529
So this whole block will become a
parking lot for the Chelsea Opera House?

617
00:39:35,607 --> 00:39:38,940
Yep, to make sure none
of Travis Cole's friends...

618
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:42,070
have to park their Mercedes
on the street.

619
00:39:42,147 --> 00:39:45,014
I've lived in this house for 62 years.

620
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:47,517
Now the bulldozers
are coming tomorrow.

621
00:39:49,388 --> 00:39:53,552
- You thinking what I'm thinking?
- No, no. I have a plan.

622
00:40:10,075 --> 00:40:12,009
What do you make of this?

623
00:40:12,077 --> 00:40:15,342
Either it's a trick and we're walking
into a huge ambush...

624
00:40:15,414 --> 00:40:19,748
or this is the single, dumbest act
in the history of crime.

625
00:40:32,397 --> 00:40:34,331
How we gonna get out of here?

626
00:40:34,399 --> 00:40:37,459
We can't make bail.
Pops is gonna die.

627
00:40:37,536 --> 00:40:39,970
We're gonna be left here to rot.

628
00:40:40,038 --> 00:40:44,270
I'm not worried about the rotting now,
I'm worried about something else.

629
00:40:44,342 --> 00:40:46,776
What else is there to worry about?

630
00:40:46,845 --> 00:40:50,246
We're in prison with prisoners.

631
00:40:50,315 --> 00:40:52,146
So what?

632
00:40:52,217 --> 00:40:55,914
So what? You know what prisoners do
to each other all the time.

633
00:40:55,987 --> 00:40:58,319
No. What?

634
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:00,153
You don't know?

635
00:41:00,225 --> 00:41:02,557
No!

636
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:04,060
They...

637
00:41:15,774 --> 00:41:17,207
I never heard that.

638
00:41:17,275 --> 00:41:19,470
You never heard that?

639
00:41:19,544 --> 00:41:21,478
How could you have never
heard of that?

640
00:41:21,546 --> 00:41:24,140
That's what prisons
are most famous for.

641
00:41:26,718 --> 00:41:28,151
All right, let's go.

642
00:41:29,888 --> 00:41:32,322
Not you, tubby.

643
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:34,620
You sure you don't want him, too?

644
00:41:36,862 --> 00:41:40,992
The popcorn in the bulldozer stunt
was allegedly perpetrated by these men:

645
00:41:41,066 --> 00:41:43,227
Mitchell Weaver
and Samuel McKenna.

646
00:41:43,301 --> 00:41:46,168
But was this
a dangerous act of mischief...

647
00:41:46,238 --> 00:41:49,730
or a heroic example
of civil disobedience?

648
00:41:49,808 --> 00:41:53,039
Those two boys sure are heroes to me.

649
00:41:53,111 --> 00:41:57,571
If Mitch Weaver and Sam McKenna
are heroes, then who's the villain?

650
00:41:57,649 --> 00:42:00,777
Many would say that would be
the builder of the parking lot...

651
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:04,549
millionaire real estate mogul,
Travis Co...

652
00:42:04,623 --> 00:42:08,081
Damn it. That looks bad.
We've got to stop the hemorrhaging.

653
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:10,684
Martin, could you wait outside?

654
00:42:10,762 --> 00:42:13,253
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry about what happened.

655
00:42:13,331 --> 00:42:16,027
It's all right, Martin.
It wasn't your fault.

656
00:42:19,738 --> 00:42:22,298
By the end of the day, I'd like Martin
jobless, homeless...

657
00:42:22,374 --> 00:42:25,275
penniless and hairless.

658
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:35,385
You fellows have a lot of growing up
to do, I'll tell you that.

659
00:42:35,453 --> 00:42:38,388
Ridiculous!
Completely ridiculous!

660
00:42:39,658 --> 00:42:43,424
Can you believe these characters?
Way out of line!

661
00:42:43,495 --> 00:42:46,953
Have a good mind
to go to the warden about this.

662
00:42:47,032 --> 00:42:50,468
The lack of respect
hurts the most.

663
00:42:50,535 --> 00:42:52,127
That's what hurts the most.

664
00:42:52,203 --> 00:42:55,434
Except for the other thing.
That hurts the most.

665
00:42:55,507 --> 00:42:59,136
But the lack of respect
hurts the second most.

666
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:01,974
Weaver, McKenna,
you're free to go.

667
00:43:06,117 --> 00:43:07,550
Ridiculous!

668
00:43:10,455 --> 00:43:12,582
First of all,
Mrs. Murphy is owed...

669
00:43:12,657 --> 00:43:16,058
my deepest apologies for the hardships
she's unjustly suffered.

670
00:43:16,127 --> 00:43:21,565
Secondly, all charges have been dropped
against Mr. Weaver and Mr. McKenna...

671
00:43:21,633 --> 00:43:24,158
who are not criminals
but heroes.

672
00:43:24,235 --> 00:43:26,897
In fact, all of us are going out
for popcorn.

673
00:43:27,806 --> 00:43:30,172
Okay, Spunky, you can come too.

674
00:43:31,743 --> 00:43:34,712
I think he's got his thumb
up that dog's ass.

675
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:37,577
Gentlemen, I think I have a job for you.

676
00:43:39,517 --> 00:43:44,352
Mitch, Sam, considering your recent
exploits as mischief makers...

677
00:43:44,422 --> 00:43:47,152
I think you may be able to help me.

678
00:43:47,225 --> 00:43:52,788
There's a small walk-up building
I own over at 99 Franklin Street.

679
00:43:52,864 --> 00:43:56,732
It's low-income housing.
My way of giving back to the community.

680
00:43:56,801 --> 00:43:59,929
But much to my chagrin,
the criminal element...

681
00:44:00,005 --> 00:44:03,441
has reared its ugly head
in the form of drug dealers, gangs...

682
00:44:03,508 --> 00:44:06,602
even a house of prostitution.

683
00:44:06,678 --> 00:44:09,943
He's doing that... Why don't you get
the cops to get them out?

684
00:44:10,015 --> 00:44:12,074
It's not that simple.

685
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:15,608
As long as those criminals
pay their rent on time...

686
00:44:15,687 --> 00:44:18,247
the police say I have no grounds
to evict them.

687
00:44:18,323 --> 00:44:22,555
- What do you want us to do?
- Get the building condemned.

688
00:44:22,627 --> 00:44:27,326
By any means necessary. That way,
everyone will be evicted legally.

689
00:44:27,399 --> 00:44:31,165
Then I'll fix it up, rent the apartments
to honest, hardworking people.

690
00:44:31,236 --> 00:44:34,933
I don't know. We've never done
anything this big before.

691
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:38,169
Gentlemen, let me give you
a minute to think it over.

692
00:44:39,911 --> 00:44:41,674
Doesn't it seem like...

693
00:44:41,746 --> 00:44:43,839
He's definitely doing that dog.

694
00:44:43,915 --> 00:44:47,612
Doesn't it seem like we're getting
into something over our heads here?

695
00:44:47,686 --> 00:44:50,587
So, gentlemen, have you decided?

696
00:44:51,489 --> 00:44:53,423
We'll do it...

697
00:44:53,491 --> 00:44:56,289
for $50,000.

698
00:44:57,829 --> 00:45:01,162
Very well.
$50,000 it is.

699
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:07,103
Good news, Mr. McKenna.

700
00:45:07,172 --> 00:45:10,005
All right, boys!
Bring on the whore!

701
00:45:10,075 --> 00:45:12,339
No, it's not a whore.

702
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:15,504
We're gonna get you the $50,000
for your heart transplant.

703
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:17,138
That's good, too.

704
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:19,342
We don't have the money yet, Pops.

705
00:45:19,417 --> 00:45:22,477
- Yeah, but it's a sure thing.
- Excuse me.

706
00:45:22,554 --> 00:45:24,886
Sam, can I have a word with you?

707
00:45:24,956 --> 00:45:27,618
- Sure.
- Thank you.

708
00:45:27,692 --> 00:45:30,627
Wait. You didn't tell him, did ya?

709
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:34,122
Thanks.

710
00:45:34,199 --> 00:45:37,134
But I still want to,
and I can't promise you I won't.

711
00:45:39,204 --> 00:45:42,731
Just getting my photo album.
What are you so jumpy about?

712
00:45:43,708 --> 00:45:47,872
I don't know. Maybe it's your
lifelong pattern of random assault.

713
00:45:47,946 --> 00:45:50,141
Look at this.

714
00:45:50,215 --> 00:45:53,412
That's me fighting for the middleweight
championship of the Golden Gloves.

715
00:45:55,019 --> 00:45:58,648
That's me shaking hands with
Dwight D. Eisenhower, US President.

716
00:45:58,723 --> 00:45:59,985
My goodness!

717
00:46:01,292 --> 00:46:03,886
That's your mom giving me a...

718
00:46:03,962 --> 00:46:05,395
I'm sorry.

719
00:46:05,463 --> 00:46:08,091
That's Sam's mom.

720
00:46:09,167 --> 00:46:11,931
Yeah. Irene.

721
00:46:13,867 --> 00:46:17,268
His blood levels are good.
Should cut down on finger foods.

722
00:46:17,336 --> 00:46:19,270
What happened to your foot?

723
00:46:19,338 --> 00:46:22,967
What I don't understand is,
when you owe a bookie a lot of money...

724
00:46:23,042 --> 00:46:27,502
and he blows off one of your toes,
you still owe him the money.

725
00:46:27,579 --> 00:46:31,606
Doesn't seem fair since he's gonna
kill me in four days anyway.

726
00:46:31,684 --> 00:46:34,881
Mitch says we'll have the money
for you.

727
00:46:34,954 --> 00:46:39,789
Thank God!
I mean, that's good news, Sam.

728
00:46:39,858 --> 00:46:42,383
We just have to get
the building condemned.

729
00:46:42,461 --> 00:46:46,124
We go in, wreck the joint.
Pops is saved.

730
00:46:47,032 --> 00:46:48,659
Did you call him Pops?

731
00:47:17,229 --> 00:47:19,356
What havoc are you planning now?

732
00:47:19,431 --> 00:47:21,695
What are you doing here?

733
00:47:22,701 --> 00:47:24,635
Actually, I was looking for you.

734
00:47:24,703 --> 00:47:27,763
I saw how you and your friend
saved that woman's house.

735
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:32,106
Guess you can use your powers
for good as well as evil.

736
00:47:33,912 --> 00:47:36,380
I'm on my way
to my grandmother's place.

737
00:47:36,448 --> 00:47:38,609
Do you want to walk me?

738
00:47:38,684 --> 00:47:42,017
Note to self. Mitch was right.

739
00:47:42,087 --> 00:47:43,782
No, he wasn't.

740
00:47:43,856 --> 00:47:45,949
It's too late.
It's already on tape.

741
00:47:46,025 --> 00:47:50,394
I'm glad you finally realized
you should never take crap from anybody.

742
00:47:50,462 --> 00:47:53,590
There's my grandma.
Hi, Grandma.

743
00:47:53,665 --> 00:47:57,761
Your grandmother lives here?
At 99 Franklin Street?

744
00:47:57,836 --> 00:48:00,964
Yep. Grandma,
I'd like you to meet Mitch.

745
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:05,170
Hi. Kathy's told me about you.
You're a hero.

746
00:48:05,244 --> 00:48:10,477
Well, today I'm a hero. Tomorrow,
who knows? You might both hate me.

747
00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:14,441
Girls, I'm over here.

748
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:17,387
Excuse me, Mitch.
It was nice meeting you.

749
00:48:19,058 --> 00:48:22,789
Are those prostitutes?
I mean, who are those girls?

750
00:48:23,962 --> 00:48:27,830
They work with my grandmother. She runs
a business out of her apartment.

751
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:30,994
Sixty years old
and still going strong.

752
00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:33,630
Yeah, I bet she is.

753
00:48:33,705 --> 00:48:36,401
Would you like to come in
for some coffee?

754
00:48:36,475 --> 00:48:41,105
No. I have to go lift weights.

755
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:42,613
What?

756
00:48:45,384 --> 00:48:47,852
Okay, some other time, maybe?

757
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,547
That'd be great.

758
00:48:49,621 --> 00:48:52,021
Okay. Bye.

759
00:49:06,638 --> 00:49:10,165
That sweet girl's grandmother
runs a whorehouse...

760
00:49:10,242 --> 00:49:12,608
out of the building
we're about to destroy?

761
00:49:12,678 --> 00:49:16,307
Yeah. I feel awful doing this to Kathy.

762
00:49:16,381 --> 00:49:19,817
Mitch, you're starting to like Kathy,
aren't you?

763
00:49:19,885 --> 00:49:22,285
No!

764
00:49:22,354 --> 00:49:26,688
I know you. When you say no
like that, you mean yes.

765
00:49:26,758 --> 00:49:29,022
- What are you talking about?
- I'll show you.

766
00:49:29,094 --> 00:49:32,063
Did you ever rob a bank?

767
00:49:32,131 --> 00:49:35,259
Did you ever climb Mount Everest?

768
00:49:35,334 --> 00:49:39,737
Did you ever say you could see why
women find Sean Connery sexy?

769
00:49:42,975 --> 00:49:44,966
Okay, so I like Kathy a little.

770
00:49:45,043 --> 00:49:49,173
Man, I hate the fact we have to destroy
her grandmother's building.

771
00:49:49,248 --> 00:49:51,512
- But we have to.
- Yep.

772
00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:41,757
We did it, man!
I can't believe it! Pops lives.

773
00:51:41,827 --> 00:51:44,887
What'd I tell you?
Here's to a brand-new heart.

774
00:51:44,963 --> 00:51:48,262
That's right. I couldn't have done it
without a genius like you.

775
00:51:48,333 --> 00:51:50,597
I couldn't have done it without...

776
00:51:52,304 --> 00:51:55,137
a big oaf to smash down
all the doors like you.

777
00:51:55,207 --> 00:51:56,834
Yeah!

778
00:51:57,976 --> 00:52:00,410
Hey, we should go pick up
our 50 grand.

779
00:52:00,479 --> 00:52:02,447
Good idea.

780
00:52:02,514 --> 00:52:04,812
Hey, is that the building?

781
00:52:06,618 --> 00:52:09,348
Building owner James Kirkpatrick
had little to say.

782
00:52:09,421 --> 00:52:12,219
Kirkpatrick owns that building?

783
00:52:12,291 --> 00:52:16,990
- What happened to the building?
- I have no idea, but I'll find out.

784
00:52:17,062 --> 00:52:19,758
Resident Gladys Waite
lamented the fall of the building.

785
00:52:19,831 --> 00:52:21,822
I don't know what I'll do.

786
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:25,836
I've been running a sewing business
out of my apartment for 30 years.

787
00:52:25,904 --> 00:52:27,735
Sewing business?

788
00:52:27,806 --> 00:52:32,300
Tenants are staying at a local shelter.
But what about the condemned building?

789
00:52:32,377 --> 00:52:35,403
Unfortunately, I'll have to level it.

790
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:38,847
Enough boring talk. I want to talk
about my true passion...

791
00:52:38,917 --> 00:52:41,647
which is the grand reopening
of the opera house.

792
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:44,655
All proceeds go to benefit
the homeless.

793
00:52:44,723 --> 00:52:49,456
You know how I feel about the homeless.
They're human beings and have no homes.

794
00:52:59,104 --> 00:53:01,038
May I help you gentlemen?

795
00:53:01,106 --> 00:53:03,904
Mitch Weaver and Sam McKenna
to see Travis Cole.

796
00:53:03,975 --> 00:53:07,138
Mr. Cole said your services
are no longer needed.

797
00:53:07,212 --> 00:53:09,407
No longer...

798
00:53:09,481 --> 00:53:12,348
Fellas, I have an idea.
Get Mr. Cole on the phone...

799
00:53:12,417 --> 00:53:14,180
I have a better idea.

800
00:53:14,252 --> 00:53:17,050
Why don't we kick
every one of your asses...

801
00:53:17,122 --> 00:53:20,285
and then go upstairs
and kick Cole's ass, too?

802
00:53:30,035 --> 00:53:32,299
All right, I screwed up.

803
00:53:32,371 --> 00:53:35,135
What do we do now?

804
00:53:38,577 --> 00:53:40,010
Homeless guys.

805
00:53:41,079 --> 00:53:46,312
I'll give you a dollar each if you run
into this building and yell and scream.

806
00:53:46,385 --> 00:53:49,946
That's very nice,
but I think what you need...

807
00:53:50,021 --> 00:53:53,457
are like some psycho,
out-of-control homeless guys.

808
00:53:53,525 --> 00:53:56,892
We're more the broken, spiritless...

809
00:53:56,962 --> 00:53:59,931
"I've lost the will to live" type
homeless guys.

810
00:53:59,998 --> 00:54:02,330
How about for two dollars?

811
00:54:20,619 --> 00:54:23,611
Mitch, Sam, what a pleasant surprise.

812
00:54:23,688 --> 00:54:26,589
- Where's our money?
- What money?

813
00:54:26,658 --> 00:54:29,752
You owe us $50,000 for getting the
building on Franklin Street condemned.

814
00:54:29,828 --> 00:54:31,420
We want it now.

815
00:54:31,496 --> 00:54:34,556
But I don't even own the building
on Franklin.

816
00:54:34,633 --> 00:54:38,399
I told you I did, but I lied.
Good luck trying to prove it.

817
00:54:38,470 --> 00:54:39,903
Son of a bitch!

818
00:54:39,971 --> 00:54:43,202
Once you stopped my bulldozer
from leveling that old lady's house...

819
00:54:43,275 --> 00:54:45,505
I couldn't let you get away with it.

820
00:54:45,577 --> 00:54:49,638
So I figured out a way for you to
help me and hurt you at the same time.

821
00:54:49,714 --> 00:54:52,649
I guess I showed you guys something
about dirty work.

822
00:54:52,717 --> 00:54:56,244
Whatever. But we're not leaving
without our 50 grand.

823
00:55:03,795 --> 00:55:07,162
When you jumped on that guard's back
and yelled...

824
00:55:07,232 --> 00:55:10,429
"The CIA put a chip in my brain"...

825
00:55:10,502 --> 00:55:14,199
I was laughing so hard
I almost shit my pants.

826
00:55:14,272 --> 00:55:16,433
Almost?

827
00:55:19,878 --> 00:55:22,039
Thanks. That was fun.

828
00:55:22,113 --> 00:55:24,445
More fun than working for Cole.

829
00:55:25,784 --> 00:55:28,810
- You worked for Cole?
- All of us have.

830
00:55:29,955 --> 00:55:31,547
I had a life...

831
00:55:31,623 --> 00:55:35,992
a house, cars,
respect in the community.

832
00:55:36,061 --> 00:55:38,757
Suddenly it was all taken away.

833
00:55:38,830 --> 00:55:42,288
I finally realized
just how low I'd sunk.

834
00:55:42,367 --> 00:55:45,097
I was at my daughter's soccer game.

835
00:55:45,170 --> 00:55:46,967
She lives with her mom.

836
00:55:47,038 --> 00:55:51,498
I was standing on the sidelines
and a cop asked me to move along.

837
00:55:51,576 --> 00:55:54,272
That's when it hit me.
I'm not even a human.

838
00:55:54,346 --> 00:55:55,779
Here's your $2.

839
00:56:04,456 --> 00:56:08,051
How could you stand outside
my grandmother's home...

840
00:56:08,126 --> 00:56:10,094
the day before you destroyed it?

841
00:56:10,161 --> 00:56:12,857
You're telling me you thought
she was a drug dealer?

842
00:56:12,931 --> 00:56:17,197
- No, I thought she was a whore!
- What is wrong with you?

843
00:56:17,269 --> 00:56:20,363
Look, we made a mistake.

844
00:56:20,438 --> 00:56:22,804
The worst thing is
we didn't even get paid.

845
00:56:22,874 --> 00:56:25,240
The worst thing is
you didn't get paid?

846
00:56:25,310 --> 00:56:29,246
- The reason we needed that money...
- Stop right there.

847
00:56:29,314 --> 00:56:32,750
You drive these people from their homes
and all you care about is money?

848
00:56:32,817 --> 00:56:34,751
I should call the police.

849
00:56:34,819 --> 00:56:38,880
I'm really sorry about what happened,
but listen...

850
00:56:38,957 --> 00:56:42,256
I'm done listening.
Have a nice life.

851
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:50,759
No, beat it, nurse!

852
00:56:51,836 --> 00:56:54,566
Come back when you're a broad!

853
00:56:57,976 --> 00:56:59,637
Hey, fellas.

854
00:57:00,845 --> 00:57:02,779
Why so glum?

855
00:57:02,847 --> 00:57:07,250
We didn't get the money.
Mr. Sure Thing here was wrong.

856
00:57:07,319 --> 00:57:10,584
I don't know what happened.
I messed up. I'm sorry.

857
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:12,122
That was easy.

858
00:57:12,190 --> 00:57:18,026
You can chalk this up as a loss
and forget about it. I can't do that.

859
00:57:18,096 --> 00:57:20,929
Pops is my dad.

860
00:57:20,999 --> 00:57:23,593
I'm sorry.
I gotta tell him. Sam...

861
00:57:23,668 --> 00:57:25,932
No. I'll tell him.

862
00:57:26,004 --> 00:57:27,938
Tell me what?

863
00:57:29,274 --> 00:57:31,469
I'm Mitch's father, too.

864
00:57:33,378 --> 00:57:34,572
It's true.

865
00:57:34,646 --> 00:57:38,275
This is no time for one
of your practical jokes.

866
00:57:38,350 --> 00:57:40,648
Show him the locket.

867
00:57:40,719 --> 00:57:42,050
Show me what?

868
00:57:49,494 --> 00:57:51,428
This is Pops...

869
00:57:53,264 --> 00:57:54,925
and your mother!

870
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,831
Yeah, I know.

871
00:57:56,901 --> 00:57:58,562
You cheated on Mom?

872
00:57:58,637 --> 00:58:02,437
No! She was there, too.
Who do you think took the picture?

873
00:58:03,875 --> 00:58:08,175
Wait a minute.
So that makes us...

874
00:58:08,246 --> 00:58:10,077
Brothers.

875
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:14,245
- You lied to me!
- Pops wouldn't let me tell.

876
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:16,753
Don't blame him.
You should have told me.

877
00:58:16,821 --> 00:58:19,949
You know how hard that man
can squeeze a pair of balls?

878
00:58:20,025 --> 00:58:21,993
It's not bad that we're brothers.

879
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:24,255
Sure, for you!
You've got everything.

880
00:58:24,329 --> 00:58:27,423
You're smart, people like you,
you never have to pay for sex.

881
00:58:27,499 --> 00:58:29,660
Pops was the one thing I had
that you didn't.

882
00:58:29,734 --> 00:58:32,202
Now I don't even have that.

883
00:58:32,270 --> 00:58:35,103
Stay away from me, all right?

884
00:58:48,953 --> 00:58:53,447
That was really funny,
siccing the cops on us.

885
00:58:53,525 --> 00:58:56,016
Really?
I thought it was funny...

886
00:58:56,094 --> 00:59:00,360
but I'm surprised you did
because you got your asses kicked.

887
00:59:04,069 --> 00:59:07,038
Things will get better.
Hang in there.

888
00:59:07,105 --> 00:59:08,697
Thanks for listening.

889
00:59:10,709 --> 00:59:12,142
Listen, pal...

890
00:59:12,210 --> 00:59:17,113
you ever need anything,
I mean anything at all...

891
00:59:18,516 --> 00:59:19,949
you come to me.

892
00:59:20,018 --> 00:59:22,486
- Can I stay at your place tonight?
- This is the thing.

893
00:59:22,554 --> 00:59:26,752
I live over at the Y, as you know.

894
00:59:29,027 --> 00:59:33,589
I got a roommate, Old Jack, who is
a little particular about strangers.

895
00:59:33,665 --> 00:59:35,656
No, problem, Jimmy. Thanks.

896
00:59:35,734 --> 00:59:38,601
He just got his knee drained.

897
00:59:38,670 --> 00:59:40,604
I'll find another place.

898
00:59:40,672 --> 00:59:45,871
He needed it, too. That thing
was getting a little bit ripe.

899
00:59:45,944 --> 00:59:48,936
I get the picture.
I'll sleep in my car.

900
00:59:49,013 --> 00:59:51,709
Old Jack's a odd duck, I tell you.

901
00:59:53,585 --> 00:59:58,045
Many times I catch him staring
at me sleeping, which is off-putting.

902
00:59:58,123 --> 01:00:00,455
- I guess that would be.
- His feet bleed.

903
01:00:00,525 --> 01:00:02,459
I don't want to stay at your place!

904
01:00:02,527 --> 01:00:05,121
Point taken.
Point taken, Mitch.

905
01:00:23,782 --> 01:00:25,511
Hey, buddy.

906
01:00:27,452 --> 01:00:29,647
I'm trying to get some sleep
back here.

907
01:00:50,341 --> 01:00:55,335
Note to self. Remember, no matter
how bad life gets, there is always beer.

908
01:00:58,249 --> 01:01:00,877
All right, I screwed up.
What do we do now?

909
01:01:00,952 --> 01:01:02,385
Homeless guys.

910
01:01:02,453 --> 01:01:06,150
I'll give you a dollar each if you run
into this building and yell and scream.

911
01:01:06,224 --> 01:01:08,749
I left the recorder on.

912
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:14,361
I don't even own the building
on Franklin.

913
01:01:14,432 --> 01:01:17,890
I told you I did, but I lied.
Good luck trying to prove it.

914
01:01:17,969 --> 01:01:19,937
Son of a bitch!

915
01:01:21,806 --> 01:01:26,175
I guess I showed you something
about dirty work.

916
01:01:31,416 --> 01:01:33,008
What are you doing?

917
01:01:33,084 --> 01:01:35,552
Getting the money from Cole.

918
01:01:37,455 --> 01:01:40,288
My tape recorder was running.

919
01:01:40,358 --> 01:01:43,759
Everything in Cole's office
I got on tape. And I got a great plan.

920
01:01:43,828 --> 01:01:48,128
Another plan? Like the plan
that got us here in the first place?

921
01:01:48,199 --> 01:01:53,899
I think I know how to get the $50,000
to save the apartment. I need your help.

922
01:01:56,441 --> 01:02:01,140
Look, a lot of stuff came pouring
out of me at the hospital...

923
01:02:01,212 --> 01:02:04,841
because I was in shock
about what I'd heard.

924
01:02:04,916 --> 01:02:07,976
How did you feel when you found out?

925
01:02:08,052 --> 01:02:11,078
I don't know.
At first I felt a little weird.

926
01:02:11,155 --> 01:02:15,751
But we've always been like brothers.
Now it's just official.

927
01:02:15,827 --> 01:02:18,352
It's kind of cool.

928
01:02:18,429 --> 01:02:22,160
I guess it is cool.
But it does change things.

929
01:02:22,233 --> 01:02:23,530
How?

930
01:02:23,601 --> 01:02:25,831
Remember in second grade...

931
01:02:25,904 --> 01:02:29,499
when we used rusty soda can tops
to become blood brothers?

932
01:02:29,574 --> 01:02:34,204
It was a bunch of trouble for nothing
because we were already brothers.

933
01:02:35,246 --> 01:02:37,009
Yeah, that's right.

934
01:02:37,081 --> 01:02:40,778
Hey, remember in fifth grade
when I was under the monkey bars...

935
01:02:40,852 --> 01:02:43,184
and I peeked at
your sister's underwear?

936
01:02:43,254 --> 01:02:44,915
Remember that?

937
01:02:44,989 --> 01:02:48,288
I was sneaking a peek
at my own sister's underwear.

938
01:02:48,359 --> 01:02:53,854
That's right. And remember
in 12th grade, you had sex with her?

939
01:02:58,603 --> 01:03:01,299
Okay, enough reminiscing.

940
01:03:04,509 --> 01:03:05,976
Listen.

941
01:03:06,044 --> 01:03:10,276
In the past two weeks, I've been
beaten up, thrown out of buildings...

942
01:03:10,348 --> 01:03:13,317
I've slept in my car,
spent the night in jail...

943
01:03:13,384 --> 01:03:16,547
And when you were in jail,
those guys...

944
01:03:16,621 --> 01:03:20,557
The point is, you aren't the only ones
who got screwed over.

945
01:03:20,625 --> 01:03:23,560
Yes, I made a big mistake
destroying your building...

946
01:03:23,628 --> 01:03:25,755
but I know how we can get it back.

947
01:03:25,830 --> 01:03:28,765
Why should we believe you?

948
01:03:28,833 --> 01:03:33,236
I walked through life believing
the only principle I had to live by...

949
01:03:33,304 --> 01:03:35,670
was "Don't take crap from anybody."

950
01:03:35,740 --> 01:03:38,231
Suddenly all that changed.

951
01:03:38,309 --> 01:03:40,937
Suddenly I was trying to do something
for someone else.

952
01:03:41,012 --> 01:03:45,415
We were trying to earn $50,000
to get a heart transplant for our dad.

953
01:03:46,918 --> 01:03:48,749
You two are brothers?

954
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:51,414
Yeah, it's a long story.

955
01:03:51,489 --> 01:03:53,423
My dad boned his mom.

956
01:03:53,491 --> 01:03:55,425
Okay, it's a short story.

957
01:03:56,594 --> 01:04:00,291
I'm saying that when you're doing it
for someone else...

958
01:04:00,365 --> 01:04:03,857
it's not just revenge,
it's standing up for yourself.

959
01:04:03,935 --> 01:04:07,632
That's why I'm asking all of us
to stand up for ourselves.

960
01:04:07,705 --> 01:04:12,768
Travis Cole screwed all of us.
I say we fight back. Are you with me?

961
01:04:16,581 --> 01:04:21,382
Are you with me based on the guarantee
that if I'm wrong, you can kick my ass?

962
01:04:25,656 --> 01:04:29,820
I understand how upset you were
when you found out what we did.

963
01:04:29,894 --> 01:04:31,828
I want to thank you
for going along with us.

964
01:04:31,896 --> 01:04:35,388
I promise you'll get your building back.

965
01:04:35,466 --> 01:04:36,899
Okay, Mitch.

966
01:04:38,870 --> 01:04:41,839
Don't screw me over again.
I mean it.

967
01:04:44,175 --> 01:04:46,109
Why didn't he punch you, too?

968
01:04:46,177 --> 01:04:48,077
I have no idea.

969
01:04:49,113 --> 01:04:54,176
Deciding to fight back against Cole
is turning things around for me.

970
01:04:54,252 --> 01:04:59,417
Travis Cole is empty inside, so he has
to make everyone around him empty.

971
01:04:59,490 --> 01:05:03,551
That's what he did to me.
But I'm not empty anymore.

972
01:05:03,628 --> 01:05:07,291
I'm filled with something,
filled with purpose...

973
01:05:07,365 --> 01:05:10,698
filled with hope,
filled with dignity.

974
01:05:10,768 --> 01:05:12,702
It's all thanks to you g...

975
01:05:14,005 --> 01:05:15,836
Guys?

976
01:05:15,907 --> 01:05:18,341
Guys, wait up.

977
01:05:24,449 --> 01:05:27,543
How you doin'? I got a delivery
of some opera costumes here.

978
01:05:27,618 --> 01:05:30,348
- What's the company name?
- Company name?

979
01:05:35,460 --> 01:05:37,052
Very clever.

980
01:05:46,104 --> 01:05:48,038
These brownies are great.

981
01:05:50,708 --> 01:05:54,474
Let's go, prostitutes, homeless guys.
Shake a leg.

982
01:05:54,545 --> 01:05:57,275
Come on, haven't got all day.
Let's go.

983
01:05:57,348 --> 01:06:00,215
Good Lord! I'm in whore heaven!

984
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:11,053
What are they watching?

985
01:06:11,129 --> 01:06:13,461
In this corner, weighing in...

986
01:06:13,531 --> 01:06:16,500
at 225 pounds...

987
01:06:16,567 --> 01:06:20,594
the former heavyweight champion
of the world...

988
01:06:20,671 --> 01:06:22,536
Kenny Norton!

989
01:06:23,608 --> 01:06:26,975
And his opponent Gary Coleman!

990
01:06:29,580 --> 01:06:33,016
Come on, man, bring it! Bring it!

991
01:06:40,992 --> 01:06:42,584
Well, here we are.

992
01:06:43,961 --> 01:06:47,727
Building tenants, you'll be serving
as the ushers and ticket takers.

993
01:06:47,798 --> 01:06:50,995
So take one of those,
and Kathy will tell you what to do.

994
01:06:51,068 --> 01:06:53,832
I can't believe I'm doing this.
I don't know why I'm here.

995
01:06:53,905 --> 01:06:58,706
Why are you here? Wait, I remember.
Intense physical attraction to me.

996
01:07:03,014 --> 01:07:04,641
What's the trouble, sir?

997
01:07:04,715 --> 01:07:09,812
My costume is not here. I cannot go
on a stage without my costume.

998
01:07:09,887 --> 01:07:13,482
Relax. I will track down
your costume personally.

999
01:07:13,558 --> 01:07:18,222
By the way, you're a fat guy.
Would you care for a brownie?

1000
01:07:19,330 --> 01:07:22,561
Excuse me, coming through.
Pardon me.

1001
01:07:22,633 --> 01:07:25,898
Excuse me. Sorry.
Coming through here.

1002
01:07:25,970 --> 01:07:30,304
I know I must really smell.
Plus, I farted. Coming through.

1003
01:07:30,374 --> 01:07:33,707
Joining me, the man responsible
for this glorious event...

1004
01:07:33,778 --> 01:07:36,110
real estate mogul Travis Cole.

1005
01:07:36,180 --> 01:07:39,843
Thank you. I'm proud of two things
about tonight's event.

1006
01:07:39,917 --> 01:07:44,718
First, all proceeds from the opera
will go to benefit the homeless.

1007
01:07:44,789 --> 01:07:48,987
And secondly, I personally oversaw
every aspect of this production.

1008
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:52,154
And I believe it will be known
as the finest staging...

1009
01:07:52,230 --> 01:07:54,926
of Don Giovanni ever presented.

1010
01:07:54,999 --> 01:07:57,627
Excuse me, coming through.

1011
01:07:59,437 --> 01:08:02,565
Hey, did you fart? I think
that was me from before. Sorry.

1012
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:04,574
Excuse me, coming through.

1013
01:08:04,642 --> 01:08:07,907
Fellas, you've heard the old saying:

1014
01:08:07,979 --> 01:08:11,642
"In the land of the blind,
a man with one eye is king."

1015
01:08:11,716 --> 01:08:14,549
Well, today, in the land
of the skunks...

1016
01:08:14,619 --> 01:08:17,247
the man with half a nose is king.

1017
01:08:23,227 --> 01:08:24,751
Hello, everyone.

1018
01:08:28,833 --> 01:08:31,563
I'm your mayor, Adrian Riggins.
Thank you.

1019
01:08:31,636 --> 01:08:34,571
Before tonight's performance
of Don Giovanni...

1020
01:08:34,639 --> 01:08:38,370
let's take a moment to recognize the man
that made this night possible...

1021
01:08:38,442 --> 01:08:43,379
the best friend this city
has ever had, Travis Cole.

1022
01:08:51,522 --> 01:08:53,456
Enjoy the opera, everyone.

1023
01:09:14,078 --> 01:09:15,670
What the...

1024
01:09:18,249 --> 01:09:21,309
Wow! Get a load
of that mountain range.

1025
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:24,083
Come back, baby.

1026
01:09:25,990 --> 01:09:29,426
This is the most daring portrayal
of Don Giovanni I've ever seen.

1027
01:09:29,493 --> 01:09:33,190
Let's go. Time for Pops
to climb that mountain.

1028
01:09:33,264 --> 01:09:34,697
What's up, fruity?

1029
01:09:34,765 --> 01:09:38,360
How did you... It doesn't matter.
You'll be gone in a minute.

1030
01:09:38,436 --> 01:09:42,133
Aha! You didn't count on
my loyal army of prostitutes, did you?

1031
01:09:44,308 --> 01:09:45,798
What do you want?

1032
01:09:45,876 --> 01:09:48,936
Just relax. Let's watch
your dirty opera.

1033
01:09:49,013 --> 01:09:51,447
You're a hell of a woman, baby.

1034
01:09:51,515 --> 01:09:54,712
Let me take you to Vegas.
You know what they say.

1035
01:09:54,785 --> 01:09:57,754
It ain't over till the fat lady
checks into a hotel with Pops.

1036
01:09:57,822 --> 01:10:01,258
What are you doing?
You're ruining Don Giovanni.

1037
01:10:01,325 --> 01:10:04,021
Don Giovanni?
Who's that dude?

1038
01:10:04,095 --> 01:10:06,086
The opera.
You're ruining the opera.

1039
01:10:06,163 --> 01:10:10,361
The opera. Yes, we are ruining that.
Sam, now!

1040
01:10:10,434 --> 01:10:12,994
You got it, buddy!

1041
01:10:13,070 --> 01:10:17,598
Sing the song, boys!

1042
01:10:18,976 --> 01:10:23,845
Bow, and kneel before me!

1043
01:10:28,486 --> 01:10:31,046
Jimmy! Release the skunks.

1044
01:10:31,122 --> 01:10:33,647
Okay, I got it. I'm on it.

1045
01:10:33,724 --> 01:10:36,750
Don't let me down, boys.

1046
01:10:36,827 --> 01:10:39,921
Run. Fly. Fly away.

1047
01:10:39,997 --> 01:10:43,865
Run! Run out! Fly!

1048
01:10:43,934 --> 01:10:45,367
Fly!

1049
01:10:50,174 --> 01:10:54,736
Skunks used to heighten the atmosphere
of squalor and despair. Brilliant!

1050
01:11:02,953 --> 01:11:05,854
The cameras are here.

1051
01:11:05,923 --> 01:11:07,857
By the way, Travis...

1052
01:11:07,925 --> 01:11:10,450
remember when you said this?

1053
01:11:10,528 --> 01:11:16,057
Note to self. Making love to blowup doll
not as good as advertised.

1054
01:11:17,268 --> 01:11:21,068
Sorry. I must have gone too far.

1055
01:11:21,138 --> 01:11:22,571
I'll just...

1056
01:11:23,808 --> 01:11:26,242
I don't even own the building
on Franklin.

1057
01:11:26,310 --> 01:11:29,677
I told you I did, but I lied.
Good luck trying to prove it.

1058
01:11:29,747 --> 01:11:31,374
Son of a bitch!

1059
01:11:31,449 --> 01:11:35,283
I bet those reporters would love
to get hold of this tape.

1060
01:11:37,621 --> 01:11:39,589
How much do you want?

1061
01:11:39,657 --> 01:11:42,148
All I want is the $50,000
you owe us.

1062
01:11:42,226 --> 01:11:43,716
$50,000.

1063
01:11:43,794 --> 01:11:46,786
Make it out to Dr. Farthing.

1064
01:11:46,864 --> 01:11:49,332
Kirkpatrick.

1065
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:51,664
Kirkpatrick is going to punch you
in the stomach.

1066
01:11:51,735 --> 01:11:53,669
Here you go.

1067
01:11:56,841 --> 01:11:58,775
You'll sign this contract...

1068
01:11:58,843 --> 01:12:02,279
that gives back ownership
of 99 Franklin Street to Kirkpatrick.

1069
01:12:02,346 --> 01:12:05,144
Give it here.

1070
01:12:05,216 --> 01:12:08,276
Thanks, Mitch.
I'm glad I didn't have to punch you.

1071
01:12:08,352 --> 01:12:10,286
Me too, buddy.

1072
01:12:11,655 --> 01:12:14,954
Okay, Cole, it's been nice
doing business with you.

1073
01:12:15,025 --> 01:12:17,619
You probably want to go home,
kick back...

1074
01:12:17,695 --> 01:12:20,789
and enjoy a nice glass
of Chihuahua piss or something.

1075
01:12:20,865 --> 01:12:21,957
Farthing.

1076
01:12:24,368 --> 01:12:27,667
Here's the check for $50,000.

1077
01:12:27,738 --> 01:12:29,171
That's great, Mitch.

1078
01:12:32,276 --> 01:12:34,767
Want to bet I don't go to my bookie?

1079
01:12:34,845 --> 01:12:39,111
You're paying off your bookie so you can
live to perform Pops's heart transplant.

1080
01:12:47,291 --> 01:12:49,691
Note to self.

1081
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:52,627
Stop payment on $50,000 check.

1082
01:12:56,267 --> 01:12:57,461
Travis.

1083
01:12:57,535 --> 01:12:59,332
Son of a bitch, bastard!

1084
01:12:59,403 --> 01:13:03,339
You idiot. That contract
won't hold up for ten seconds...

1085
01:13:03,407 --> 01:13:05,841
after my lawyers get through with it.

1086
01:13:05,910 --> 01:13:09,710
And, oops, what happened
to your tape?

1087
01:13:09,780 --> 01:13:14,513
You wrecked it. Well, don't worry.
I have one on the house P.A. system.

1088
01:13:14,585 --> 01:13:16,280
Hit it, Kathy.

1089
01:13:18,255 --> 01:13:21,088
Note to self. Remember to get
ass wart cream...

1090
01:13:21,158 --> 01:13:23,319
for giant wart on my ass.

1091
01:13:23,394 --> 01:13:26,158
It's a little bit past that.

1092
01:13:26,230 --> 01:13:29,358
You bastard! You can't destroy me.
I'm Travis Cole.

1093
01:13:29,433 --> 01:13:32,493
No one destroy's Travis Cole!
No one!

1094
01:13:36,106 --> 01:13:38,006
Fat lady, are you okay?

1095
01:13:38,075 --> 01:13:43,377
Yes, I'm okay. Just keep
that crazy old man away from me.

1096
01:13:45,549 --> 01:13:47,710
What the hell is going on?

1097
01:13:47,785 --> 01:13:50,720
I don't care if you are my son.
Get your own broad.

1098
01:13:51,722 --> 01:13:53,451
Bravo!

1099
01:13:55,859 --> 01:13:59,920
In a startling turn of events
at the opera house...

1100
01:13:59,997 --> 01:14:04,263
real estate mogul Travis Cole
has been arrested for fraud.

1101
01:14:04,335 --> 01:14:06,269
Mr. Cole, anything to say?

1102
01:14:07,438 --> 01:14:09,702
Good brownies.

1103
01:14:09,773 --> 01:14:13,869
Jenkins, listen to me.
This is very important.

1104
01:14:13,944 --> 01:14:19,610
Stop payment on a check for $50,000
I made out to a Dr. Farthing. Got that?

1105
01:14:19,683 --> 01:14:23,642
Jenkins, are you ready
for some crazy, rough sex?

1106
01:14:24,722 --> 01:14:26,656
Absolutely!

1107
01:14:26,724 --> 01:14:31,388
Good, Jenkins. I'm counting on you.
And find Spunky.

1108
01:14:36,967 --> 01:14:38,229
Hey, Mitch.

1109
01:14:38,302 --> 01:14:42,170
Jimmy. Your new nose looks great.

1110
01:14:42,239 --> 01:14:45,333
Thanks. Best $200 I ever spent.

1111
01:14:47,411 --> 01:14:51,575
- That girl you're with, she's not the...
- Yep.

1112
01:14:51,649 --> 01:14:55,779
Lin-Yung, the Saigon whore
who bit my nose off.

1113
01:14:55,853 --> 01:14:57,480
We're getting hitched.

1114
01:14:59,723 --> 01:15:00,815
Let's go.

1115
01:15:00,891 --> 01:15:06,295
Hold on.
I'm talking to my friend here!

1116
01:15:06,363 --> 01:15:11,426
Jeez, sometimes you got
to remind the hen who the rooster is.

1117
01:15:12,603 --> 01:15:14,537
Good luck to you, Jimmy.

1118
01:15:14,605 --> 01:15:16,937
Okay. See you around.

1119
01:15:19,943 --> 01:15:22,275
When I say "Let's go," you go.

1120
01:15:22,346 --> 01:15:26,373
Yeah? It's time you shut
your cake hole, Yoko!

1121
01:15:26,450 --> 01:15:27,883
Women.

1122
01:15:29,753 --> 01:15:32,847
Don't talk back to me
in front of my friend.

1123
01:15:32,923 --> 01:15:35,357
You're making me really angry.

1124
01:15:35,426 --> 01:15:39,294
Whoa, that scares me to death.

1125
01:15:41,465 --> 01:15:44,901
You bit my new nose off!
Damn it!

1126
01:15:44,968 --> 01:15:47,596
How you feeling with your new heart?

1127
01:15:47,671 --> 01:15:52,335
I feel great thanks to you and Sam,
my two boys.

1128
01:15:52,409 --> 01:15:56,140
Now that I met Gladys, I hope
they can fix another part of my body.

1129
01:15:56,213 --> 01:15:58,511
I'll give you a hint.

1130
01:15:58,582 --> 01:16:00,880
It rhymes with "cock."

1131
01:16:05,389 --> 01:16:10,292
Sam and I got great new jobs.
Pops got his heart. And I got the girl.

1132
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:14,228
And Dr. Farthing, well,
he got over his gambling problem.

1133
01:16:14,298 --> 01:16:18,166
But the bookies beat him
to death anyway, so he's dead.

1134
01:16:19,236 --> 01:16:21,466
That's it. Bye.

1135
01:16:25,409 --> 01:16:28,003
Cole, it's nice
doing business with you.

1136
01:16:28,078 --> 01:16:30,546
Now you probably want to get home...

1137
01:16:36,620 --> 01:16:37,814
Sorry.

1138
01:16:37,888 --> 01:16:40,618
- Nurse, you want to record vitals?
- Cut.

1139
01:16:40,691 --> 01:16:44,525
Cole, it's been nice doing business
with you. Now you...

1140
01:16:44,595 --> 01:16:46,358
Cut.

1141
01:16:50,334 --> 01:16:52,495
Say your line again.

1142
01:16:56,106 --> 01:16:59,234
- Check the gate please.
- Cut.

1143
01:17:02,045 --> 01:17:06,106
- Well, Cole...
- I'm trying to help you.

1144
01:17:06,183 --> 01:17:08,583
Have you always been like this?

1145
01:17:08,652 --> 01:17:10,882
How you got this movie,
I'll never know.

1146
01:17:10,954 --> 01:17:15,288
- Some other time we could go camping?
- What?

1147
01:17:15,359 --> 01:17:18,021
- You know, just you and me.
- Let's go.

1148
01:17:18,095 --> 01:17:20,029
Mitch, I'm lonely.
