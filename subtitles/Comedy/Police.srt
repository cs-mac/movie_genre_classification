1
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,639
Try in another way

2
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,637
Listen to me...

3
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,638
I will fall down being after you all the day

4
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,637
Falling down is not gentle 

5
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,639
I like to beat people, but I don't want to do it now

6
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,639
See the gun? Found on your body

7
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,637
I haven't assay it yet

8
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,637
If it is used...

9
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,636
You must get at least 5 years 

10
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,637
At least, do you know?

11
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,638
The judgers are cold-blooded

12
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,639
But I can assume not to see the gun

13
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,637
Throw it away

14
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,639
But it costs

15
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,637
Cost?

16
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,636
What cost?

17
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,637
You need to help me

18
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:44,639
You need to help me

19
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,639
We can keep the promise

20
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:53,629
What did Luo talk to you in Marseilles?

21
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,637
He wanted to find a dealer

22
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,639
He had no acquaintance to trust

23
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,637
You helped him

24
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,636
No

25
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,639
Luo gave me 30 thousand to bring goods to Holland

26
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,637
Half half profit
Too dangerous

27
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,638
Small trade meeting is ok

28
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,637
Then what did you say to him?

29
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,637
I said I can ask somebody to do

30
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,637
Can you?

31
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,636
Simon

32
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,636
Who is Simon? Simon

33
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,637
Simon...?

34
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,636
Simon Samani

35
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,636
They three brothers cooperate with each other

36
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,639
Simon Maxime and Jean

37
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,637
Dealer in Boliviere

38
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,639
They live in Boliviere, yes

39
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,638
But can't get a deal, they are too rich

40
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,638
They often go to Holland

41
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,638
Bring back one kilogram each time, it's enough for a long time

42
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,639
They are big dealer in Paris and Marseilles

43
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,636
Then?

44
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,638
I told Simon his background

45
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,637
Then you helped Simon trade for drug

46
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,637
No, I didn't

47
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,637
When is Luo's first deal?

48
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,637
I don't remember the date

49
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,637
He called me to ask for 50 grams

50
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,636
Then?

51
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,639
I sent it to him

52
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,637
How much did he pay you?

53
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,637
One thousand and five hundred

54
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,637
One thousand and five hundred for you?

55
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,637
No, I gave the money to Simon

56
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,636
How much did you earn?

57
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,636
Only 200

58
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,637
You 200, then Simon 1300

59
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,637
Great, it's a good deal

60
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,637
Then?

61
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,637
Luo added 200 grams more

62
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,637
This time Simon went with me to Marseilles

63
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,637
Why would Simon go with you?

64
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,638
Because trust is limited, he didn't believe me

65
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,637
I'm afraid I'm (logged)

66
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,636
Will you?

67
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:44,639
Donno, maybe yes

68
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,637
How much did Luo pay you?

69
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,636
6000

70
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,637
How much do you earn?

71
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,638
Nothing

72
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,638
Luo had no money

73
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,638
Then the following one?

74
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,636
He asked for more goods

75
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,636
How many?

76
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,636
300 grams

77
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,636
How many?

78
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,636
I said 300 grams

79
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,637
How much is it?

80
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,636
He paid Samani 9000

81
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,637
Me 1500

82
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,638
I don't understand, why need you?

83
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,637
Simon and Luo has already known each other

84
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,637
Why do you still be the intermediator?

85
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,637
That's our convention

86
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,638
Simon had no such case, 
he didn't want to get involved

87
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,636
You were in charge of carrying of goods

88
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,637
Yes

89
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,637
Then?

90
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,639
It was over, Simon was too crafty

91
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,636
Why?

92
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,637
Impure and expensive

93
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,636
Sure

94
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,636
Then no job?

95
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,637
Yes, no job

96
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,637
Then what about you later?

97
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,639
I help Luo to contact with other people

98
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,636
You know many people

99
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,637
Who was he this time?

100
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,636
Momo

101
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,636
Momo...?

102
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,636
Who is Momo?

103
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,637
Everyone knows who is Momo

104
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,637
I don't know where did you know him?

105
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,636
In Paris?

106
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,636
Bar

107
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,637
Which one?

108
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,636
Can't remembers

109
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,637
Ever saw Simon again?

110
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,637
Before and later

111
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,637
No, but I tried to keep away from him

112
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,636
His two brothers are mad

113
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,636
Why say so?

114
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,639
They always armed with guns...

115
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,637
They were afraid of my business

116
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,636
Their worries are right

117
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,638
Then?

118
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,637
Someday they came to see me

119
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,636
Beat me

120
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:24,639
Do you have the address of Simon?

121
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,637
No, I don't, you must have, give it to me

122
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,638
I just know he lives with a France girl Noria

123
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,638
I don't know the actual place

124
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,636
Who is Noria?

125
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,637
I don't know

126
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,638
Shall I go? Make a record first

127
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,636
Name?

128
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,637
Taylor Luyadi

129
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,636
Why called (Gauthier)?

130
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,639
Coz it has some taste of France...

131
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,636
Where are they now?

132
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,636
I don't see them ever leave

133
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,637
What dose she look like?

134
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,638
Light brown hair, down like this

135
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,636
Is she tall?

136
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,636
Something likes that

137
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,637
Pretty?

138
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,636
Oh, fine

139
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,637
I go to eat something

140
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,636
Bring me ham sandwich

141
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,636
Me, too

142
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,637
You stay here

143
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,637
Xi, must be her

144
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,637
I think she must go to drink coffee

145
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,637
Follow her

146
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,636
Xi, dude!

147
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,639
Monitor the exit of the building

148
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,636
We go to find her

149
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,637
Let's go

150
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,637
I go inside

151
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,637
Police, don't move

152
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,637
Let's leave quietly

153
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,636
I haven't pay for my coffee

154
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,637
I pay

155
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,637
Be quiet, which will be alright

156
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,636
He is upstairs?

157
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,636
Who?

158
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,639
Bring her along

159
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,637
Police, don't move

160
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,637
Come 

161
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,636
It's not my home

162
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,636
Why do you come here?

163
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,636
I'm waiting for a friend

164
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,637
Come on, take on the clothes

165
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,637
We can go to bed when we truly love each other!

166
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,637
What do you think?

167
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,639
The dirty things are not drug

168
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:40,639
There is nothing inside

169
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,636
What on earth are we searching for?

170
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,637
I don't know

171
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,636
We will find

172
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,639
Check the plug on the wall

173
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,637
They must hide something

174
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,639
You must wear it for a long time

175
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,636
Whose?

176
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,637
Mine, the bankbook is mine

177
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,636
You have account in the bank?

178
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,636
Yes

179
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,636
What about you?

180
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,637
No, I don't have an account

181
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,636
I mean that's your...

182
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,637
Come, count!

183
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,637
They must leave already

184
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,636
Catch Stlouis?

185
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,636
Yes

186
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,636
He is cautious, too

187
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,638
Helpful to our case?

188
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,637
In order to inform your

189
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,636
How much?

190
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,636
2000

191
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,638
A big amount

192
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,636
Is that illegal?

193
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,639
Damn, we would eat at 4

194
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,636
Whose is it?

195
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,637
Mine

196
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,637
The keys are yours?

197
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,636
I never saw that

198
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,637
It's not my home

199
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,636
The keys are not mine

200
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,637
They are put on the shelf

201
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,636
Whose keys?

202
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,636
Maybe former owners?

203
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,636
He left many things

204
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,637
What's his name?

205
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,158
I don't know him!

206
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,639
I forget the archive

207
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,639
Xi, it's on time

208
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,639
You maybe useful for sometime

209
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,636
Give the overclothes to me

210
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,637
Quickly!

211
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,637
Your watch

212
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,639
Take off all of them?

213
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,637
All

214
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,637
Lay down

215
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,637
Cough

216
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,637
Ok, take on the clothes

217
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,637
What shall I do?

218
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,637
Tell me one thing

219
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,637
You can change

220
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,637
I'm telling your truth now

221
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,636
Not before?

222
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,639
I don't think it's him

223
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,637
I'm poor

224
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,638
He has credit card

225
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,637
We should make it clear

226
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,637
Yes, but he is a lonely old man

227
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,636
With 4 children

228
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,637
One of which is disabled

229
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,637
I accuse him he is

230
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:04,639
I don't know he has credit card

231
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,638
You knew it before

232
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,638
Don't be woebegone

233
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,636
Do you know him?

234
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,639
Yes, it's him

235
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,636
Can I go to the toilet?

236
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,638
You should go to toilet earlier

237
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:38,639
Stupid, you have no right to do it

238
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,636
He is nervous!

239
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,637
I really can't bear...

240
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,637
Can't bear

241
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,637
You can bear!

242
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,637
They keep me waiting for several hours! Stupid!

243
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,637
Ok, come

244
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,637
It's a brand, with paster

245
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,636
How much?

246
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,636
Around 150

247
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,637
That will put you in jail for 10 years!

248
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,636
That thing?

249
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,638
Nothing found

250
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,639
We can put 100 grams drug here

251
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,637
We all know you are a dealer

252
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,637
You searched my house, nothing yet...

253
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,637
Ask me to do dealer?

254
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,637
Too ridiculous

255
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,637
It's you who are ridiculous

256
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,636
What's your name?

257
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,637
Samani

258
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,639
Everyone calls you Simon

259
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,636
Birth date and place?

260
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,638
August 16, 1955 Tunisia

261
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,637
How long do you live with Noria?

262
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,636
Around one year

263
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,637
Any record?

264
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,636
No

265
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,636
Souce of incoming?

266
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,636
No job for two months

267
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,639
Worked in the outskirts

268
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:44,639
400 monthly, a job of no future

269
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,636
Any bank account?

270
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,636
No

271
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,638
We find the evidence that you bought a car

272
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,636
Where is the money?

273
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,637
That's reserved a month ago

274
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,638
How much is your rent?

275
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,636
The house is Noria's

276
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,637
I ask you how much is your rent?

277
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,636
Donno...150?

278
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,636
She pays the rent

279
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,637
No bank account, but you have savings

280
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,637
I have no money to hide

281
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,636
Then how do you live through recently?

282
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,636
The remaining money of job

283
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,637
Which job?

284
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,638
I have no money,

285
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,636
The deposit of buying a car?

286
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,637
Except the 2250

287
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,637
Other money is not yours

288
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,637
All are mine, they are Noria's

289
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,637
Go to prove that I'm wrong

290
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,638
When did you come to France?

291
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,637
3 years ago

292
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,636
Reason?

293
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,637
Travel

294
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,638
Look at the new style clothes, buy good suit

295
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,637
Good looking

296
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,636
Have you family?

297
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,637
I have 5 brothers

298
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,636
All are in France?

299
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,636
In Tunisia

300
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,638
Do you know Luo Panzers?

301
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,636
Taylor Luyadi?

302
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,638
We are all from Tunisia

303
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,636
Did you meet in France?

304
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,637
No...Ah, ever saw Taylor

305
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,637
Saw him in France

306
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,637
Did you see Luo in Marseilles?

307
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,637
Did you go to Marseilles?

308
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,637
No, never

309
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,638
Ah, I went

310
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,637
I went there to visit him

311
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,636
Once

312
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,636
Why visit him?

313
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,636
There must be a reason

314
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,637
No, just dropped in

315
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,637
Panzers said he met you and Luyadi in Marseilles

316
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,639
He said you want him to trade drug for him

317
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,637
He is lying

318
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,636
Someone named Simon left his telephone number in Paris

319
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,637
3488996...Any impression?

320
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,638
Of course yes, that's my telephone number

321
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,638
Then you provide Luo Heroin

322
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,637
No, I didn't, no one will call me Simon

323
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,637
I gave the telephone number to Luo

324
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,636
We have tracked Panzers's telephone number

325
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,637
He phoned you

326
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,639
A lady asked Luo if he need the goods

327
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,637
What's the matter?

328
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,639
I don't know, ask Noria

329
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,637
Someone told Luo, Simon just left

330
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,637
No one will call me Simon

331
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,636
No one?

332
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,636
That's too ambiguous

333
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,637
Many people named Simon

334
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,637
After that, he asked for Maxime, your brother

335
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,637
Are you clear?

336
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,636
Many people named Maxime!

337
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,637
You admit your brother answered the call

338
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,637
He is not around, not at all in France

339
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,637
He was driven out

340
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,636
After that, he was back

341
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,636
He answered the call

342
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,638
Can you explain?

343
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,636
I have nothing to explain!

344
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,638
If you have any evidence, just accuse me

345
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:24,639
I understand my right

346
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,639
No, I can't hear anything

347
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,637
How do you know?

348
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,636
How?

349
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,636
Wearing grapevine?

350
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,637
I don't know

351
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,636
Is it serious?

352
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,637
They actioned

353
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,637
They all heard

354
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,637
You have no evidence to accuse him

355
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:48,639
Marseilles's police ask you to go for a drive?

356
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,639
Yes, his brother will be happy!

357
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,636
I'm alright

358
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,637
Can I see you later?

359
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,637
When? Later

360
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:04,639
Call me first?

361
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,637
Bye-bye, Lambert

362
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,637
I'm Gam...

363
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,637
Lawyer Lambert, how are you? See you later

364
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,636
No problem

365
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,637
Try to ask them to calm down

366
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,636
Margin is looking for me

367
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,637
Bicha usually hugs me

368
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,637
I prefer he give me money

369
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,636
How much does he owe me?

370
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,637
He will pay off

371
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,636
Does he work now?

372
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,638
But he has a specialty to earn money

373
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,637
You are so good, why do you have no job?

374
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,637
Am I on vacation?

375
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,637
Nobody will put cash at home

376
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,639
Find other things to do
If you are arrested, you will be in big trouble

377
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,637
If I introduce those big figures to you

378
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,638
They will ask who is the buffoon?

379
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,637
I'm joking just now

380
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,636
That's not funny

381
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,638
You won't laugh if bulletin shot in your ass

382
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:52,639
Those people are not humorous

383
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,637
We are already disappointed, especially now

384
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,639
All are killing each other

385
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,637
Simon is arrested

386
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,638
In Tunisia, complain for hiking up of the bread...

387
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,637
600 people died in the riot

388
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,637
Now, he will talk about the case of Simon

389
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,636
He is not my privy C

390
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,638
These are heard

391
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,638
Marseilles orders...

392
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,636
Can you speak again?

393
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,637
What order?

394
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,637
(A hue and cry from court)

395
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,638
Police in Marseilles has already inform relative departments in Paris

396
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,637
That's from judger

397
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,637
For this case, I think they won't let him go

398
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,638
Marseilles will arrest you, that's a bad news

399
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,638
Even harder in Paris

400
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,636
They won't let him go

401
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,636
I will try my best

402
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,637
I will help the girl out

403
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,636
We just care about brothers

404
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,638
Why not bail him out like in USA

405
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,636
Marseilles want to tack him to death

406
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,638
No true gangs in France

407
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,636
What are they afraid of?

408
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,639
In Holland, German, Spain

409
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,638
If bailed out, he can come out

410
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,637
Why don't you warn Simon?

411
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,638
You are our private lawyer, aren't you?

412
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,636
My mother warned him, what does that mean?

413
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,639
Someone blame him out, I just receive the news

414
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:10,639
We are hep

415
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,637
Thanks, great

416
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,636
But I eat too much

417
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,638
Ok, anyway

418
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,636
What's that? How does it come?

419
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,637
Mint wine

420
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,637
The lady over there invites you

421
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,639
Who? Which one?

422
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,638
She is Aicha, Shaby's wife

423
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,636
The one whom you helped out of the jail

424
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,637
Good health!

425
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,639
I have a talk with him

426
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,639
We can trust him

427
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,636
Ok, sign

428
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,637
Sign what? I won't sign

429
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,637
It's you said

430
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,636
I said nothing

431
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,636
I refuse to sign

432
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,638
It's the same whether you sign or not

433
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,639
I won't sign

434
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,636
If he won't say, we are in trouble then

435
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,637
I will catch them, send them to Marseilles

436
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,637
Try another way

437
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,636
He is really troublesome

438
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,638
Let's see then

439
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,637
Your coat

440
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,637
I want to find the policeman

441
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,636
Just a minute, you wait first

442
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,636
I want to see him!

443
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,636
Damn!

444
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,637
You have seen him

445
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,636
Damn!

446
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,637
Late for 2 hours

447
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,638
What do you do with that woman? Idiot

448
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,637
Do you like her?

449
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,636
She excites you?

450
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,636
Xi, don't be nervous

451
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,639
Anyway, she is troublesome now

452
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,636
Her procurer is mad

453
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,638
He can't manage her, he is a madman

454
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,637
He is the damn criminal

455
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,638
Shut up, I can't talk with you seriously

456
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,637
You always ignore

457
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,638
No, tell you, it's she who pursue me, do you know?

458
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,637
Look at your suit

459
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,637
Like a procurer

460
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,637
Of course! He ask me to be a procurer again

461
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,637
Yes, really, friend

462
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,637
Don't you think so?

463
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,637
It's no problem dining with a cheater

464
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,639
But they always want more

465
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,638
You said I become a cheater? Aren't you?

466
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,637
Yes, yes

467
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,637
Ok, we make it clear

468
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,636
I don't like you doing that

469
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,637
Come on

470
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,636
Is Lydie downstairs?

471
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,636
Nobody here

472
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,637
I can't let you in

473
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,636
I see her car is still here

474
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,637
I said, you can't go inside

475
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,636
Is she here?

476
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,637
No, I've already told you

477
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,636
They are talent cheater

478
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,636
You are here!

479
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:56,639
I have friends here, Inspecteur Mangin

480
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:00,639
See one, and then see all!

481
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,638
I was caught by fly cop!

482
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,637
Me? Come on!

483
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,637
I can't work soon

484
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,637
D¨¦d¨¦ will be back soon

485
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,638
Tell him things have gone
He should understand

486
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,638
I told him, he can't believe me

487
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,637
I don't know, prosecute him

488
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,638
Grame him is ok

489
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:24,639
Ok, will your policeman friend help?

490
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,636
What are you doing?

491
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,637
Speak with inspecteur

492
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,637
He will take back the accusation

493
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:34,639
Don't follow her, she is drunk

494
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,637
Sorry, a friend has a birthday party

495
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,637
Come on

496
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,638
I'd better go back first

497
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,636
He is already mad

498
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,637
Now he is really unhappy

499
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,637
Good night, no, wait

500
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,636
Sorry

501
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,638
D¨¦d¨¦ should say sorry to me

502
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,638
Did you see? Ah?

503
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,637
You arrest him, he asks me to defend for him

504
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,637
Can you do that?

505
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,637
Maybe I put him into jail again

506
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,636
He never know it's me

507
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,638
At least I can let him in jail for another two years

508
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,638
He would be in prison and he will thank me

509
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,639
Sometimes, you are really funny

510
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,636
It's the best way dealing with police

511
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,636
No harm at all

512
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,637
If yes, they ask for it

513
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,637
Anyway they deserve

514
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,638
I have tired of defending for my privy C

515
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,637
I tell you

516
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,638
They are murder and thief

517
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,637
Things in their archives are truth

518
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,638
We just do what we need to do

519
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:34,639
I tell judger: (Judger...

520
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,638
He didn't do that, he is a kind man)

521
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,637
My privy C's are all guilty

522
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,637
I'm sure

523
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,957
It's incredible

524
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,637
Can I see inspecteur Lolun?

525
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,639
Ask the lady, go

526
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,638
How is it going? 
Gauthier, are you ok?

527
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,636
Do you go to Pizi restaurant for dinner?

528
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,638
Are you happy yesterday night?

529
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,637
Inspecteur, how are you

530
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,636
How are you?

531
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,637
Let me talk to him

532
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,636
Do you know him?

533
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,637
Ren¨¦, go over there

534
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,637
How about the girl?

535
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,639
I go to see her, contact later

536
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:20,639
Mr. Aijiashu? Follow me

537
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,637
Oh, seat here

538
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,638
Averyone called Ren¨¦?

539
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,637
Yes, French name, I like it

540
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,637
You are criminated in 1980

541
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,639
Yes, bribery and ammo trade

542
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,636
Can you tell me...?

543
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:00,639
Do you have any impression of these names?

544
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,638
No, I don't think so

545
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,638
Do you have any impression of Luo Panzers?

546
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,637
Ever heard of Luo

547
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,637
But Panzers, no impression

548
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,637
I knew one or two Luo in bar

549
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,637
They usually came to the bar

550
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,636
Good, then it seems that...

551
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:26,639
Luo called you in bar in Marseilles

552
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,637
I can't remember whether any guest called me

553
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,637
or anybody called me

554
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,638
Who are responsible for the answering the phone

555
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,636
Me

556
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,637
Then Luo called you

557
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,637
Inspecteur, listen to me, when I had something to do...

558
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,637
I will ask guest or other people to answer the phone

559
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,639
Coz I can't answer myself, no time

560
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,639
Do you have any impression with the people in the photo?

561
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,637
I know this one, he is Simon

562
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,638
I saw the girl one or two times in bar

563
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,637
She was coming to find somebody

564
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,636
Whom?

565
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,638
If I'm not wrong, I met her on the phone

566
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,637
I can recognize her voice

567
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,636
She called to find Simon

568
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,637
How do you know Simon?

569
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,637
I knew him when I was young

570
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:14,639
We are neighbors, I know his family

571
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,638
I know his brothers, Jean and Maxime

572
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,637
Where do they live?

573
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,637
I can't tell you

574
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,639
I don't like those ask for the address of guests

575
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,637
Then you explain...

576
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,638
Why did Panzers call to the bar to find Simon?

577
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,638
Mr. Inspecteur, usually somebody called here

578
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,638
Sometimes I keep the message for the guest

579
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,637
Panzers usually called here

580
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,637
Yes, many times a day

581
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:44,639
But I'm not sure if it was from Panzers

582
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,638
What do you make a living?

583
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,638
They are not my friends

584
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,638
But Simon is a man not attend to his proper work

585
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,638
Jean and Maxime, I don't know

586
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:03,638
I'm not familiar with them, just ordinary guest

587
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,637
Ok

588
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,637
Shall I go?

589
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,671
Make a record first

590
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:18,639
Come here, open it

591
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,637
Ciga?

592
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:36,639
I'm hungry, anything to eat?

593
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,637
What do you want?

594
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,637
Sandwich? Anything

595
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,636
What sandwich?

596
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,636
Ham

597
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,638
What do you drink?

598
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,637
Water

599
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,637
Give me sandwich and water then

600
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,637
Ok, come here

601
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,637
Come here

602
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,639
Get a number, quick

603
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:20,639
Ok, your number

604
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,637
Manager, how are you

605
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,638
It's Marie Vedret

606
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,636
For the training of police

607
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,638
She will work with us

608
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,636
Mangin, take care of her

609
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,637
Sure

610
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,638
If any case, let her do

611
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,637
She is ready anytime

612
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,637
She is really extraordinary

613
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:45,638
Anything funny?

614
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,637
Take a photo first

615
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,637
Sit there

616
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,637
Wait, let me put the things down

617
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,637
Your number?

618
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,637
Take care!

619
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,637
Great

620
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,636
Again

621
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,638
If know then point him out

622
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,637
That's alright, look

623
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,638
Go, they won't hurt you

624
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,638
Ah, it's you, is your finger alright?

625
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,638
Ah, I'm in my shop

626
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,639
Three young men came in

627
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,637
They pointed to me with gun

628
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,638
Order me hand in the keys of the coffer

629
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,636
I refused

630
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:31,639
The one with gun dropped the gun

631
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,637
Picked out a knife

632
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,638
Cut my finger

633
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,637
Did they wear masks?

634
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,636
No, they didn't

635
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,637
We find one of them

636
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,638
Try if you can recognize him, look

637
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,638
Then, I can hardly beare the ache

638
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,637
I waved my arm

639
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,638
I hit the...

640
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,637
Alarm, they ran away

641
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,636
They are all gone

642
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,637
Now listen to me 

643
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,638
Try to recognize the ugly face

644
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,637
Look at behind the curtain

645
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,636
Shall I look?

646
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,637
Don't be afraid, they can't see you

647
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,637
Come, look

648
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,637
Can you see?

649
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,636
Yes

650
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,637
How?

651
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,637
No

652
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,636
I can't recognize anyone here

653
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,637
Which one?

654
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,637
I can't recognize

655
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,636
Not the no. 5?

656
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,637
He isn't

657
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,637
Which number do you say?

658
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:32,639
5, no, he isn't

659
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,637
Ok, come here

660
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,637
Follow me

661
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,636
Lolun, come here

662
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,636
You said no. 5 isn't?

663
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,637
Look at the chart

664
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,638
Any familiar name?

665
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,636
Ah?

666
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,637
No one

667
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,636
Including Gauthier Luyadi?

668
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,636
Yes

669
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,636
Luo from Marseilles?

670
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,637
No

671
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,638
Did Simon ever say where to visit somebody?

672
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,637
I said, I never went there

673
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,636
He didn't say where

674
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,637
But he didn't go to Marseilles!

675
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,637
We know he usually bring heroin to...

676
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,639
Luo gave us names of you two

677
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,637
He lied!

678
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,638
I don't know him, he is lying

679
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,638
You knew him when he called you

680
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:54,639
Impossible, it's impossible to find my number

681
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,636
He called you to reserve the order

682
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,638
It's impossible to find my number

683
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,636
He can't called me

684
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,637
Your number is 3488996

685
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,636
Yes, how?

686
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,637
What?

687
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,637
What are you doing?

688
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,637
Again

689
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:21,639
Let's restart from the beginning

690
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,636
If you don't know Luo

691
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,637
He can't call you

692
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,638
We have track Luo's phone line

693
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,638
He called your number

694
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,636
I'm not interested

695
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,637
You will be interested

696
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:38,639
Educational

697
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,637
Is Simon here?

698
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,636
He has no goods any more?

699
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,639
Too bad, he doesn't know...

700
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,637
What should I do?

701
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,637
Ask him bring some goods tonight!

702
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,637
I have said, he has no goods!

703
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,638
Impossible! I have nothing left!

704
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,637
Even him

705
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,638
We should stop for a while, do you understand?

706
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,637
Why do you ignore without goods?

707
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,637
He had a little yesterday

708
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:15,639
Yesterday, I had no time

709
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,636
You need many?

710
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,636
He know how many I want

711
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,636
Don't know how to say

712
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,636
Today is weekend

713
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,637
Any impression?

714
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,636
That's not me

715
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,637
Great!

716
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,637
He called your number!

717
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:30,639
Maybe he phoned

718
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,636
I don't know him! Damn!

719
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,637
Say it when decided

720
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,636
Don't say any more (damn it!)

721
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,637
You said it's impossible to find your number...

722
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,637
Maybe Simon gave him my number

723
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,638
That's not the voice of Simon

724
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,637
Explain!

725
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,637
No, that's not me

726
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,636
Who is that?

727
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,637
How can I know?

728
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,637
Will woman answer the phone when you are out?

729
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,637
Then who is the woman answering the phone?

730
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,638
Maybe part-time workwoman of weekend

731
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,639
I doubt what on earth did you do in the weekend

732
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,638
Those girls won't answer the phone

733
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,636
They had their things to do

734
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:16,639
What did you do in the weekend?

735
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,637
Amah

736
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:24,639
Where?

737
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:28,639
Wherever has

738
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,636
Nonsense!

739
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,637
I don't believe

740
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,639
Would I say I please you with my voice?

741
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,638
Do you know three brothers Jean, Maxime or Simon?

742
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,636
Heard, but don't know

743
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,636
They are not live in France

744
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,637
Didn't they come to Paris?

745
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,639
Maybe for vacation...

746
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,636
It's your diary?

747
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,636
Yes

748
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,638
Names inside is your friends'?

749
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,637
Yes...

750
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,637
Who is Aicha?

751
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,637
Come...

752
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,638
Who is Aicha?

753
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,637
Aicha?

754
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,639
I remember, Nov. 11, Aicha

755
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,637
The woman I know in gym

756
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,638
She gave me her phone number

757
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,636
To let us contact with you. Do you see her again?

758
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,638
Once...in the street

759
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,636
Didn't she call you?

760
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,639
I didn't gave her my phone number

761
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,638
Where did she live?

762
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,637
Can't remember

763
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,637
You do, where did she live?

764
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:48,639
Maybe 15th district

765
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,637
Strange, we checked her number

766
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,636
The one named Aicha

767
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,638
Lived in 20th district...

768
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,637
I don't understand

769
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:02,639
Gapha, replace me for a while

770
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,639
I will be right back

771
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,636
You look on us as fool?

772
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,636
Don't pretend to be innocent

773
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,637
Tell the truth!

774
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,637
Look, Panzers!

775
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,636
Do you know him?

776
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,556
An old woman know you

777
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,637
What's this?

778
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,637
I tell you...but I want to tell the truth!

779
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:26,639
An old woman saw you and recognized you

780
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,636
Which old woman?

781
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:32,639
The one you cut her finger

782
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,636
Are you silly?

783
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,636
She recognize you!

784
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,637
Who did?

785
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,637
I didn't hurt any old woman

786
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,636
You cut her finger down!

787
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,638
I never cut down the finger!

788
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,638
To get the password of the coffer

789
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,638
Coffer? Password?

790
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,637
Nonsense

791
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,637
Not nonsense, tell the truth

792
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,637
What truth?

793
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,637
The coffer, stupid!

794
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,638
I don't know what are you talking about!

795
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,639
(For our daughter)

796
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,637
She know you can cut somebody's finger

797
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,637
Bad guy can be kind, too

798
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:12,639
I agree that people like you

799
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,636
My T-shirt, shit

800
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,636
Look!

801
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,637
A big fuss

802
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,637
He is son of a gun!

803
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,638
Get down the murder!

804
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:32,639
To a big fuss! Son of a gun!

805
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,637
What happened?

806
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,637
Nothing, I have a backup T-shirt

807
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,639
If I pee shall I hold it?

808
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,636
You are still here?

809
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,636
Don't be so impolite!

810
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,636
Coz you are a trainer?

811
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,637
Be polite

812
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,638
I'm edgy!

813
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,637
Come in

814
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,637
Mangin!

815
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,637
What happened?

816
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:16,639
Nothing, he ram on the table

817
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,637
Write a report to me

818
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,636
Understand

819
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,637
I don't like that!

820
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,636
Can you recognize your own voice?!

821
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,637
Not mine!

822
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,637
Who answered? Aicha?

823
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,637
Where do you find the key?

824
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,637
Can you recognize?

825
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,638
Yours or Simon's?

826
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,637
I never saw that

827
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,636
Not yours?

828
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:42,639
Do you know what will happen to you?

829
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,638
I will send you to be on trial in Marseilles

830
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,637
Shut up...

831
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,637
Shameful

832
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:00,639
He is educating on us!

833
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,636
Listen yourself

834
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,637
What do you want to do?

835
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,639
Tell me what happened?

836
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:34,639
Yours or Simon's?

837
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:40,639
I will send you to Marseilles to be on a trial

838
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,637
Sure!

839
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,636
Follow me

840
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,637
Let's go

841
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,638
Are you sure we can succeed

842
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:07,638
Tell him why you attend the action

843
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,638
They take all my things away

844
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:14,639
For 6 hours, why so long time?

845
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,636
I'm not feeling good

846
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,637
Coz the wine!

847
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,636
Shut up!

848
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,637
Must be

849
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,638
Like an utterly worthless person!

850
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,637
I have a good appetite

851
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,637
An utterly worthless person!

852
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,637
Are you still in India?

853
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,636
Look at your blood pressure!

854
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:34,639
You didn't drink there!

855
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,636
What do you want to do?

856
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,637
Burst the vein!

857
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,637
Do you want to play?

858
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,637
Go away!

859
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,636
No, he is angry

860
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:47,639
Just outside...

861
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,637
I used all the night

862
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,638
Are you familiar with outside?

863
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,636
Everything is familiar!

864
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,636
I have a friend from other place

865
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,636
He is familiar...

866
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,636
Impersonation

867
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,638
I remember when I was young, in the bar

868
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,637
The guy always say to winebottle

869
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,637
The remaining is not too much...

870
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,637
They said to winebottle

871
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,636
He said looking at them...

872
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,638
Sirup... How are you!

873
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,637
See them...?

874
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,637
Mint...rice cake...

875
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,637
The guy is really serious

876
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,637
Me, too

877
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,637
I'm not sure

878
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,637
Almost done, but you mess it up

879
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,636
I want the woman...

880
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:48,639
3, 4, 5...

881
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,637
Ok, done

882
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,637
I like the girl

883
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:00,639
I will be in trouble...

884
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:04,639
You son of a gun!

885
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:41,636
He is done...

886
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,637
Over there...behind Gauthier!

887
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,637
Relax...Come...

888
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:46,636
I finish my archive

889
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:47,636
Have a drink we go to Ren¨¦

890
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,637
Who makes record of me...?

891
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,637
Are you mad?

892
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,636
We are talking about business

893
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,637
Wait... Mr. Mangin?

894
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:55,636
I'm busy

895
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,636
Looking for you

896
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,637
Mangin

897
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,637
Where?

898
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,638
It interests me, I come right now

899
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:07,636
How about commando?

900
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,638
You ask them go

901
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:11,636
I thought you went to bar

902
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:12,636
We are behind

903
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:13,636
A man with knife...

904
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,638
Chahuana Street..., we go

905
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:17,636
D¨¦d¨¦?

906
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:18,636
We find him later

907
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:19,636
The same route

908
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,637
All get on the car

909
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,637
Go!

910
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:36,636
They mess you up

911
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:40,639
They are bound to die!

912
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,637
Find a good dream

913
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,637
I'd better go back to Marseilles by air

914
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:53,636
Only one hour

915
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,637
No, that will mess it up

916
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:56,636
Ok, it's too bad for you

917
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:59,638
Just a business within two days!

918
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,637
Ambulance is coming...

919
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,639
You missed the corpse

920
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:09,636
Shall we check them?

921
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:10,636
Of course not

922
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:13,638
Don't do that in public

923
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,636
You needn't

924
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,637
You needn't ask to get the information

925
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:17,636
What happened?

926
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,637
Someone called that heard sound of gun

927
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,637
No witness

928
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:22,636
But find an arab killed

929
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,637
Is he dead or not?

930
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:27,638
Sent to first aid, it's a miracle he came back

931
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,638
It's the best they kill each other, I like most

932
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:34,639
I track them

933
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:55,638
How are you..., D¨¦d¨¦ beat you again?

934
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:56,636
Do you know why?

935
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:59,638
He loses up the money again

936
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,637
He loses money and she help to sodomize others

937
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,638
You two are really having a good taste

938
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:08,639
He hurt my face, how could I work?

939
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,637
If he beat me like a policeman

940
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:11,636
without wound...

941
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,637
I have regular customer

942
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:14,636
I'm not wandering in the street

943
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,637
I will be used to it

944
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:17,636
Money is evil!

945
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,637
D¨¦d¨¦?

946
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:20,636
I don't want to be cold all the night

947
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,637
He is upstairs..., where else to go?

948
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:24,637
Give the keys to me

949
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:25,636
He hide in my home

950
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:29,639
Oh, that's your home

951
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,638
I pay the rent, rent under my name

952
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:33,636
Let's go

953
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,637
With her? Any trouble?

954
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,637
Don't exaggerate...

955
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:38,636
We can handle him...

956
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,637
People like him always bring us trouble

957
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:41,636
What then?

958
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,637
Don't be slowly

959
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,637
D¨¦d¨¦ is yellow race

960
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:47,636
Only beat woman

961
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,637
That's the thing

962
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:50,636
You stay

963
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:53,638
You'd better follow me...

964
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,637
go there

965
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,637
Contact you later

966
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:02,639
Better he doesn't see you

967
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,638
Don't put me inside!

968
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:25,636
Go back to be procurer!

969
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,637
I hurt my foot when I broke the door!

970
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,637
We find 40 grams' drug

971
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:30,636
That's his, not mine!

972
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,637
Who ask the 40 grams'!

973
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,637
We can see you everyday

974
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,637
The accusal is small

975
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:39,638
Whatever the accusal is

976
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:40,636
My duty is to do like that

977
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,638
Do you want one?

978
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,637
I need, I have got

979
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,638
Search everywhere...

980
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,637
Take him away!

981
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:51,636
Search everywhere!

982
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,637
Let me go!

983
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:57,639
What are you doing here?

984
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:02,636
Police

985
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:06,639
Drive licence and car licence

986
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:11,636
Aren't you crazy?

987
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:15,639
Mangin, he lashed me with belt!

988
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,638
Didn't we arrest him?

989
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:20,637
No, we didn't...

990
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:22,637
Go inside...

991
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:26,639
No, we don't

992
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,637
It's a good place for a policeman

993
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,637
You are rich!

994
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:46,636
Just render one

995
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:47,636
How much does it costs

996
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:48,636
I pay by cash

997
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:51,638
You are so lucky, they just finish

998
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:55,639
I really like it

999
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,637
you are afraid of being ugly

1000
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,637
Go and see!

1001
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:10,636
Do you have children?

1002
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:12,637
Yes, two

1003
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:14,637
How old are they?

1004
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,638
one is 15, the other is 10

1005
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,637
Where do you and your wife sleep?

1006
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,638
But bed seems to be inversed...

1007
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,637
She didn't die in the bed

1008
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:26,637
Now my elder daughter sleep there

1009
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,637
She is living inside the room

1010
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:32,639
I really like it

1011
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:40,636
You are really gentle...

1012
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:41,636
Extreme misery

1013
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:45,639
Say when my feeling is ok!

1014
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,638
Like a shy prostitute!

1015
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:49,636
Can I bathe?

1016
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:53,639
Look, the wine is good

1017
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,637
I spend much money

1018
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,638
Be careful, it is too hot

1019
00:49:58,760 --> 00:49:59,636
Where do you sleep?

1020
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:00,636
Over there

1021
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:01,636
There?

1022
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:05,639
It will be better you are alone there

1023
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,637
My mum is not in good mood, she said...

1024
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,637
If I can start from the beginning

1025
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,637
I would rather be a prostitute

1026
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:41,639
I'm good looking, she said

1027
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:44,638
Like many other women

1028
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,637
She think prostitutes are pretty

1029
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:49,638
or coquettish

1030
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:50,636
How old are you?

1031
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:52,637
19

1032
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:57,639
19 doesn't believe love

1033
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,637
I call you later

1034
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,637
How are you

1035
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,637
Ren¨¦, how are you

1036
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,638
Why didn't you show up last time?

1037
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:28,637
I have something to do

1038
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:30,637
You are in trouble

1039
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:32,636
Go to see Jean

1040
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,637
He needs me, real

1041
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,637
I can't...

1042
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:40,639
Simon is looking for you, too

1043
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:42,637
Ok

1044
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:45,638
He wrote to me, he is disappointed...

1045
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:46,636
I have saved the girl

1046
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:49,638
He wants to know why is he still in

1047
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,637
His phone call is tracked

1048
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,637
His dealer looks me as a fool

1049
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,637
One day he said towel

1050
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:56,636
then spinner

1051
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:58,637
Then selling blanket

1052
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:00,637
fitment

1053
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:01,636
Then he said

1054
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:02,636
Simon planed to carry the goods

1055
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:04,637
The guy is a fool

1056
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:05,636
Listen to me, Luo must take back his affidavit

1057
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,637
A cup of water please?

1058
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,638
Luo will deny in the front of judger

1059
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:11,636
I mean

1060
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,637
I am sure he will deny

1061
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:14,636
Will he admit the crime beforehand?

1062
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:16,637
What shall we do then?

1063
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:19,991
I'm sure he will deny

1064
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:31,636
How are you, Maxime, are you ok?

1065
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:32,636
What's the condition?

1066
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:33,636
Are you ok?

1067
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:34,636
Yes

1068
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:36,637
How is the non-dead guy?

1069
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:37,636
You look yourself

1070
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,637
He is still in bandage after 3 months

1071
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:40,636
That's my tendon

1072
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:42,637
What happened?

1073
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:44,636
Agnail

1074
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:45,636
Which kind?

1075
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:46,636
Can't remember

1076
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:48,637
Dr. told me, but I forget

1077
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:51,638
I didn't wear your shoes luckily

1078
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:52,636
They ask me to operate again

1079
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:54,637
I'm scared

1080
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:56,636
That's not funny

1081
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,638
They must breast him!

1082
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,637
He can't shot right in short distance

1083
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,638
The guns blocked

1084
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:08,639
You mean your gun is blocked?

1085
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:12,639
The one you shot on stays with 4 guys

1086
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:16,637
How lucky you are

1087
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:18,637
Things are bad for you now

1088
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:19,636
Keep lowness

1089
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:23,639
If he doesn't turn out, we shouldn't turn out either

1090
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:28,639
I hope you get him down quickly

1091
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:30,637
He should turn out after the examination

1092
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:32,637
Police in Marseilles know, too...

1093
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:35,638
If they want, maybe delay for one year

1094
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:36,636
One year?

1095
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:37,636
Yes, miss!

1096
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:41,639
Any medicine for headache?

1097
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:43,636
I go to find one

1098
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:44,636
Follow me

1099
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:45,636
I think we have no way

1100
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,637
Here you come

1101
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:48,636
Simon is in prison

1102
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:51,638
Who knows what does Jean want to do

1103
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,637
He is useless

1104
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:56,638
Don't worry, he is not as stupid as me

1105
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:57,636
Of course not

1106
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:01,639
Don't do that after being out

1107
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:02,636
I almost lose my life

1108
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:04,637
You only care about yourself and money!

1109
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:05,636
That's it

1110
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:06,636
Yes, you are right

1111
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:09,638
I'm supprised by the money problem!

1112
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:10,636
I don't like money

1113
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:12,637
Nor any trouble

1114
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:16,639
Is that simple

1115
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,637
Listen to me, if you are questioned

1116
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:30,638
You know nothing, understand?

1117
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:32,637
Never heard of Gauthier

1118
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:35,638
I try to contact your brother

1119
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,637
Why can't you stand in the bright side?

1120
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:38,636
You are overexpose

1121
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:41,638
If I were you, I will go back to Tunisia

1122
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:42,636
Tunisia?

1123
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:43,636
I would rather go to prison

1124
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:44,636
Not long

1125
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:48,639
After things go down, you can come back

1126
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:49,636
Those policemen won't stop

1127
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,637
Till you are dead

1128
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:55,639
Do you notice?

1129
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,637
Ok, enough

1130
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:58,636
Shall we go?

1131
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:02,639
Maxime, we're going

1132
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:04,636
Thanks for your letter

1133
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:06,637
I understand

1134
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:12,637
Mangin, how are you

1135
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,637
Thanks for visiting my privy C

1136
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:16,636
Thanks Gapha, he is fromo Marseilles

1137
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,637
Let me introduce, lawyer Sha

1138
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:20,637
Marie, our training head!

1139
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:21,636
Nice to meet you, I'm Lambert

1140
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,637
You are out?

1141
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,637
Bailed out

1142
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,637
But I have been there for 3 months

1143
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:28,636
You will be innocent

1144
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:30,637
Judger don't like woman to be in prison

1145
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:33,638
They think women are weak and innocent

1146
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:34,636
I'm innocent

1147
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:36,637
It's just my duty

1148
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:39,638
I won't follow one guy to death all my life

1149
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,637
Out is out

1150
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:42,636
Isn't it better?

1151
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:43,636
Why do you come here?

1152
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:44,636
Just drop in

1153
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,637
That's our duty

1154
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:47,636
Then come to your duty

1155
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,637
The date tonight is still ok?

1156
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:50,636
I think so

1157
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:51,636
Bye bye!

1158
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:52,636
I hope you can dine with us tonight

1159
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:54,637
If I am a cheater

1160
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:56,637
I am eager to arrested by you

1161
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:57,636
Shut up

1162
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,637
You are pretty

1163
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:00,636
How about Maxime's lawsuit?

1164
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:01,636
Can't change anything!

1165
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,637
He insisted, so I went to meet him

1166
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,638
Mangin, stop!

1167
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:07,636
Sorry, inside

1168
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:08,636
Will you come tonight?

1169
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:10,637
No, I will go back to Marseilles

1170
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:11,636
Continue trying hard

1171
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:15,639
It's a challenge for me

1172
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:17,637
We try our best to arrest them

1173
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:18,636
The judger just lets them go

1174
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:20,637
You think that's funny!

1175
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:22,637
The woman shouldn't be set free

1176
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:24,637
Doctor, how are you

1177
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,637
Gapha, from Marseilles vice squad 

1178
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,637
I'm making a record for Sha

1179
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:29,636
It's order from court

1180
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,637
How is his situation?

1181
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,637
Physically, I'm ok

1182
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:34,636
Then we start

1183
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:36,637
Please

1184
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:38,637
Ah?

1185
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:45,639
More policemen

1186
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:46,636
Maxime, are you ok?

1187
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:48,637
I'm very fine

1188
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:00,638
Nothing to tell us?

1189
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:03,638
You falled down on the knife when you were on a walk?

1190
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,637
Maybe

1191
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,637
Simon is in prison while you are lying here

1192
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:10,638
How pity is your brother!

1193
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:12,637
Why?

1194
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:15,638
Simon is in prison and you take over his business

1195
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:19,639
Sit side by side with Gauthier, don't you?

1196
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:21,636
No, I mean

1197
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:22,636
Mean what?

1198
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:24,637
Coz...

1199
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:25,636
I don't know him

1200
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:27,637
Listen to him

1201
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:30,638
You accept...       What's wrong with you?

1202
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:31,636
The tendon

1203
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,637
Is your heel ok?

1204
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:35,637
Aching?

1205
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:36,636
Should be

1206
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:38,637
I ask you promise to confess

1207
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,637
Who are you?

1208
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:41,636
Maxime, Simon's brother?

1209
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,637
Maxime...

1210
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,638
How this happened?

1211
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:48,637
I don't know

1212
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:49,590
You don't know

1213
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:23,636
That bag is nice

1214
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,637
Where did you buy it?

1215
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:26,636
Gamin District

1216
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:30,639
These are my brothers, Aicha...Jean...

1217
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:39,637
My little brother Jevin...my lawyer

1218
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:40,636
He introduces...

1219
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:44,639
this person...

1220
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:48,638
He gave us keys of the house

1221
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:51,638
So she looks faithful, but

1222
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:55,639
We don't know what does she do behind us

1223
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,638
You let them to be these way?

1224
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:00,636
Leave it

1225
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:02,637
I bring the money home

1226
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:03,636
You asked for the money

1227
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:06,638
Simon doesn't let me to be a prostitute

1228
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:08,637
You can only do that

1229
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:10,637
You are hopeless, so...

1230
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:11,636
intermeddle all the day

1231
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,637
Simon really chose a winner!

1232
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:16,638
Shut her up, or I will beat her!

1233
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:19,638
I'm going out, bye

1234
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:21,637
Judger will ask you what's (Gray goods)

1235
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:23,637
What's (pink goods)

1236
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:24,636
You say (blanket) is ok

1237
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:25,636
Kidding?

1238
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:27,637
I'll try my best

1239
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:29,636
Ok

1240
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:31,637
He is a fool

1241
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:35,638
He doesn't understand at all

1242
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,637
Wait here like a savior

1243
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:38,636
Come back to Earth!

1244
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,637
Don't you miss your man in prison?

1245
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:42,637
Understand his situation?

1246
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:44,637
A good woman

1247
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:45,636
Always support him behind him

1248
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:47,637
Thanks for your reminder, if sentence him 10 years

1249
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:49,637
I won't wait for him for so long time

1250
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:51,637
As long as I'm alive, he won't stay in prison for 10 years

1251
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:53,637
If yes, you should ask him first

1252
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:55,637
If I see you are with man

1253
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:59,639
I will shot him dead

1254
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:02,638
Ren¨¦, calm down

1255
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:04,637
Simon won't know

1256
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:05,636
Our habit is

1257
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:07,637
Don't touch woman unknown

1258
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:08,636
I'm not stupid

1259
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:10,637
I will find in other places

1260
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:11,636
If you do that, you are finished

1261
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:14,638
If I know, are you sure!

1262
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:16,637
Our family is keen on face-saving

1263
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:20,639
We are all respected by others

1264
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,637
I'm just kidding

1265
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:24,637
Don't joke with such things

1266
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:26,637
Will you go to Marseilles?

1267
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:28,637
Yes, with his mother

1268
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:30,637
Can you give me fare of train?

1269
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:32,637
I'm poor

1270
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:37,637
I need money

1271
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:41,636
More

1272
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:42,636
I want first class

1273
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:44,637
What can she do with 50 dollars?

1274
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:46,637
Then you give her?

1275
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:48,637
What's wrong with you?

1276
01:01:58,760 --> 01:01:59,112
No, let me

1277
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:02,637
No, I invite

1278
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:06,639
Come here, give me the bill

1279
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:11,636
Come on, you have no money

1280
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:12,636
My money is more that yours

1281
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:14,637
Your privy C never change money

1282
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:17,638
You can say they usually lose their money

1283
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:18,636
I bet with them

1284
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:20,637
They always like that

1285
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:22,637
If I bet 10, they will bet 1000

1286
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:23,636
He don't know how to get back the money

1287
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:26,638
He just can say: later

1288
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:27,636
Find it after I help you out

1289
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:28,636
But they never change money!

1290
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:30,637
Oh, really?

1291
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:34,639
You must change money to me

1292
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:38,638
Listen to me, she means

1293
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:40,637
She is too...

1294
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:44,639
Thank you, miss

1295
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:50,638
Shall we...one night?

1296
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:54,639
Can't remember anything?

1297
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:55,636
I remember you

1298
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:57,637
No change

1299
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:01,639
It's a thing 10 years later

1300
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:09,637
Don't touch me

1301
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:12,638
I swear...

1302
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,637
Maybe the clothes...

1303
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:16,637
There are many pretty and lovely women

1304
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:18,637
Less pretty than you

1305
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:22,639
No, I mean

1306
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:26,636
I have been tired of this kind of life

1307
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:27,636
I plan to sell

1308
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:28,636
What do you want to do?

1309
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:29,636
I will leave

1310
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:31,637
There are 4000 lawyer buildings in Paris

1311
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:33,637
Twenty of which accept big case, profitable

1312
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:34,636
200 of which have a good business

1313
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:35,636
Others...

1314
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:38,638
Which one you can go to?

1315
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:40,637
Nowhere

1316
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:41,636
I have other things to do in the future

1317
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:43,637
For example?

1318
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:45,637
Court

1319
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:48,638
Hope one day I can...

1320
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:49,636
Be inspector or judger

1321
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:52,638
Will judger wear diamond earing?

1322
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:54,637
I can take off in the court

1323
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:55,636
Sure?

1324
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:56,636
Let's dance, ok?

1325
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:58,637
No, I don't dance

1326
01:03:58,760 --> 01:03:59,636
I eat too much

1327
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,637
I don't want to go to any place

1328
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,637
If she wants to go...

1329
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:07,639
Let's dance

1330
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:12,639
(You are still so lovely...)

1331
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:14,637
She don't believe I date you

1332
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:15,636
She thought it's another woman

1333
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:17,637
It's none of my business if it's another woman

1334
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,637
You are really...

1335
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:21,637
Really born...

1336
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:23,637
It's yes for her and me

1337
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,637
born to be a couple

1338
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:30,638
You can say so

1339
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:32,637
Full of mysterious

1340
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:33,636
Yes, I don't know why

1341
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:35,637
That's your business

1342
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:45,636
Marie

1343
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:47,637
I want you

1344
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:49,636
Shall we stop?

1345
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:51,637
Do you like me to say (continue)?

1346
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:52,636
You are not grateful at all

1347
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:54,637
You can go

1348
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,637
Mangin, you are stupid

1349
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,637
Should say have a bad taste?

1350
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:03,639
Really? Why?

1351
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:18,637
Two policemen!

1352
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:23,639
Am I really not good?

1353
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:27,639
Actually do you think of it?

1354
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:31,637
Yes, I do

1355
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:33,637
I don't

1356
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:38,639
I never do with policeman

1357
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:40,637
Come

1358
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:52,637
I mean go to bed!

1359
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:55,638
What an attitude you are

1360
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:59,639
Do you want to cajole me?

1361
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:05,639
We now need D¨¦d¨¦

1362
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:12,639
Western Indian will let woman be prostitute quickly

1363
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:17,639
Two weeks later, then abandon them

1364
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:19,637
But they are rhythmic

1365
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:21,637
What's the point?

1366
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:40,637
I know why do you kick me under the table

1367
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:43,638
You put D¨¦d¨¦ to jail, I date with his girlfriend

1368
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:45,637
Son of a gun

1369
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,637
Are you ok?

1370
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:53,637
Ok

1371
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:57,637
Not dancing?

1372
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:59,637
I'm not coming to dance

1373
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:01,637
But go

1374
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:10,637
I wanted to invite you to drink

1375
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:12,637
But here only woman can invite

1376
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:13,636
I have no money!

1377
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:15,637
Bad business?

1378
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:20,638
No, wait...

1379
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:22,637
Calm down

1380
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:25,637
You go tonight by air!

1381
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:26,636
Yes

1382
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:29,638
Or I can't face my work

1383
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:33,639
And I'm work for someone!

1384
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:35,637
Why do you help D¨¦d¨¦

1385
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:39,639
The necklace is beautiful

1386
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:40,636
Anything else?

1387
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:42,637
You can take mine

1388
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:43,636
Do you want?

1389
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:45,637
Too bad, yours is worthless

1390
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:46,636
Worthy of feeling

1391
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:48,637
Don't you like?

1392
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:52,639
You dance well

1393
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:03,637
We are forgeted!

1394
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:05,637
Noria, are you happy?

1395
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:06,636
We shall leave each other?

1396
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:08,637
Yes, ok

1397
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:18,637
Sometimes high, sometimes low

1398
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:22,638
Sometimes alone or not

1399
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:26,639
You will think why are you with bad guy...

1400
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:27,636
Do you always ache like that?

1401
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:29,637
My mother doesn't love me...

1402
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:32,638
So I want to balance with woman

1403
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:35,638
You love to find excuse

1404
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:37,637
May say in that way

1405
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:38,636
Get on the car

1406
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:42,639
I drive you to your car?

1407
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:54,638
Then we say good night?

1408
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:58,639
I fetch the car, you needn't send me back home

1409
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:03,638
Can I ask you a question?

1410
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:07,639
Will you treat me like Lambert did just now?

1411
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:15,637
You won't

1412
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:17,637
Why I won't

1413
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:21,639
Maybe you and she are not alike

1414
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:23,636
You just imitate

1415
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:25,637
Those people don't know how to accept you

1416
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:29,639
I don't want to be accepted by others

1417
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:31,637
Because your man is in the prison

1418
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:33,637
You can't be with others

1419
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:37,639
Lambert is not the style you like

1420
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:39,637
You were factitious when you two are together

1421
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:41,637
You are stupid

1422
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:52,639
Is he good in the bed?

1423
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:55,637
He loves me at his first sight of me

1424
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,637
Sure

1425
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:01,637
It's useful to have a good lawyer

1426
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:04,638
Understand, business matter

1427
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:08,639
Can give me more rights?

1428
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:12,638
Partially, let me go

1429
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:13,636
You are stupid!

1430
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:14,636
Come, kiss me

1431
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:16,637
Stop, are you crazy

1432
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:18,637
That's too ridiculous

1433
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:20,637
Let me go!

1434
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:21,636
That's too ridiculous!

1435
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:24,638
You think if you love a woman for a while

1436
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:28,639
you can...

1437
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:32,637
That's too ridiculous

1438
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:33,636
Sorry

1439
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:37,639
But I believe the moment

1440
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:39,637
Real

1441
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:45,637
I understand

1442
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:07,639
Then what shall we do now?

1443
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:12,639
Let's go for a drive

1444
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:16,639
We go to buy Eiffel Night

1445
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:21,639
I want to read newspaper

1446
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:54,637
Please

1447
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:00,638
I never love anybody

1448
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:02,637
I do

1449
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:12,637
You say, it's...

1450
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:14,637
I love him very much

1451
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:23,638
I think we can last for long

1452
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:24,636
Stupid

1453
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:28,639
If love is like that, it's finished

1454
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:31,638
You will feel uncomfortable at the beginning

1455
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:35,639
It's more sense of safety if believe in nothing

1456
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:42,638
I feel bad

1457
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:46,639
It seems that I have no future

1458
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:50,639
I think I'm wasting my life

1459
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:55,639
No, you will be ok

1460
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:35,639
Now it's ok

1461
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:41,639
We behave like two children

1462
01:13:57,760 --> 01:13:58,636
That's what I like

1463
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:02,639
We talk all the night, forget the time

1464
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:09,639
Do that from 15 or 16

1465
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:23,637
Day is breaking

1466
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:26,637
I'm going

1467
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:32,638
Train will start an hour later
Hello, can I speak to Mr. Mangin

1468
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:37,639
No, it's for me

1469
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:41,639
That's alright, thanks

1470
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:47,639
Can I ask for the second number?

1471
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:55,637
I'm ok

1472
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:56,636
No...

1473
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:57,636
Yes...

1474
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:01,639
Simon's little brother left a bag

1475
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:05,638
I don't know, he tell me not to open it

1476
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:07,637
Have a look!

1477
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:25,637
There are two guns inside

1478
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:26,636
What shall I do?

1479
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:30,639
Do nothing, as if never see it

1480
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:33,637
If someone ask you to send the bag

1481
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:35,637
Never do that

1482
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:37,637
When will you be back?

1483
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:39,637
Tomorrow

1484
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:41,637
One more thing: change a new lock

1485
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:45,639
So that they have no keys to open

1486
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:53,639
You try to contact me less frequently

1487
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:05,637
Anything wrong?

1488
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:06,636
Nothing

1489
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:08,637
But I lose confidence

1490
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:10,637
Don't lose confidence

1491
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:13,638
They won't keep me for long

1492
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:14,636
I know, I'm trying...

1493
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:16,637
I've try my best

1494
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:18,637
Even if we broke up

1495
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:19,636
I think I love you for ever

1496
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:21,637
I never forget you

1497
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:23,637
Even if I'm with other man

1498
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:26,638
I swear I never love others

1499
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:30,639
Do you what happened when girls do that?

1500
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:33,638
You mean you plan to leave me?

1501
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:34,636
No, I swear I won't

1502
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:36,637
I'm sure you are good

1503
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:39,638
You are for my good, I know

1504
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:42,638
Not like your other brothers

1505
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:44,637
I don't want to destroy the feelings of your family

1506
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:45,636
But that's true

1507
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:48,638
They won't let you love any woman

1508
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:50,637
Money is everything

1509
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:51,636
I will go back to be a prostitute at last

1510
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:55,639
They think so

1511
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:57,637
Noria, listen to me

1512
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:00,638
You won't end like that

1513
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:02,637
No need at all...

1514
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:06,639
To end with prostitute like others

1515
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:08,637
If you need money, ask from Ren¨¦

1516
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:09,636
Ok

1517
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:10,636
How to deal with the robbery?

1518
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:14,639
Our people won't steal each other

1519
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:17,637
What do you mean?

1520
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:19,637
What robbery?

1521
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:23,638
All our money are stolen

1522
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:25,637
Noria, they say you stole them

1523
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:26,636
Look, you are so again!

1524
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:29,638
I know it's not you, I believe you

1525
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:30,636
I love you

1526
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:32,637
If it's me I will ask you to forgive me

1527
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:34,637
Won't beg them

1528
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:38,639
None of their business

1529
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:47,639
I want to trust you

1530
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:51,639
I really want, but it's serious

1531
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:55,637
That's about our family

1532
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:58,638
Swear, none of your business

1533
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:00,637
I assure you with my head

1534
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:08,637
Are you nervous, ladies?

1535
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:10,637
She is already ok

1536
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:15,639
Ok, V...

1537
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:19,639
The moment comes, tomorrow is an important date

1538
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:22,636
You are required to accept the exam

1539
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:24,637
Two days later, she can teach you

1540
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:26,637
She will be police officer

1541
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:27,636
Some people can be decided quickly

1542
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:29,637
Some have to wait...

1543
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:30,636
Wait? I can't be trained like that all my life

1544
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:33,638
Normal training is 3 years!

1545
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:35,637
No, thanks

1546
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:43,637
Half pint

1547
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:46,638
Does test give you great pressure?

1548
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:47,636
Bachelor of Arts

1549
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:48,636
No, Master's

1550
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:50,637
Better!

1551
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:52,636
I hate exam

1552
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:55,638
Good, (hallucinogen)

1553
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:56,636
Why call me (hallucinogen)?

1554
01:19:56,760 --> 01:19:58,637
Detective hating love!

1555
01:19:58,760 --> 01:19:59,636
Good!

1556
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:01,637
I think I will miss you much

1557
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:03,637
Let me see if I can find him

1558
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:05,637
That's private !

1559
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:10,637
Where are you?

1560
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:14,639
Who are (they)?

1561
01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:18,637
I come right now

1562
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:25,639
You don't know where I go, ok?

1563
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:29,639
Happy tonight

1564
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:31,637
They will let him say, you don't know them

1565
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:33,637
I don't know them

1566
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:35,637
Who do they think did it

1567
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:36,636
My little brother and I

1568
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:39,638
They think money is stolen by us

1569
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:40,636
What money?

1570
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:43,638
I've said, steal from them

1571
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:45,637
Their mother said to me

1572
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:47,637
How much?

1573
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:50,638
I don't know, she didn't say

1574
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:51,636
I think it's a big amount

1575
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:52,636
How much on earth?

1576
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:54,637
I don't know

1577
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:56,637
Listen to me... If you want me to help you

1578
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:58,637
You should tell me the details

1579
01:20:58,760 --> 01:20:59,636
Understand?

1580
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:01,637
Did you steal the money?

1581
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:03,637
No, I didn't

1582
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:05,637
I mean

1583
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:07,637
Help my brother out

1584
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:08,636
Help me

1585
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:12,639
They will harry him

1586
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:15,637
What do you want me to do?

1587
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:19,639
Go after them with gun?

1588
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:21,636
I depend totally on you

1589
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:23,637
Don't disappoint me

1590
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:25,637
I'm scared

1591
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:28,637
Wait

1592
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:42,637
Come on

1593
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:05,636
Calm down, ok?

1594
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:06,636
Ok

1595
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:08,637
What did you do?

1596
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:10,637
Try to attack

1597
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:15,638
That afternoon, Maxime called me

1598
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:16,636
Said there is a bag for me

1599
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:19,638
Within witch there are two guns, handed to my little brother

1600
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:21,637
Then he said he asked my little brother...

1601
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:23,637
to hand in the bag with guns

1602
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:25,637
Let him testify them

1603
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:29,639
I never see my little brother after that

1604
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:37,639
Here is the name and sign

1605
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:48,636
I never mention about the money

1606
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:50,637
Things are complicated

1607
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:56,636
I stay to monitor her little brother?

1608
01:22:56,760 --> 01:22:57,636
Nonsense!

1609
01:22:57,760 --> 01:22:59,637
I mean! You must stay

1610
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:01,637
See you later

1611
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:13,637
Is your eye better?

1612
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:15,637
Unluckily

1613
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:19,639
My cornea has been operated for 3 times

1614
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:25,637
What are you doing at home?

1615
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:26,636
Waiting for you

1616
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:27,636
Jean has something to talk to you

1617
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:29,637
Don't worry

1618
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:31,637
Nobody is angry

1619
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:37,639
Noria, it's Aicha

1620
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:43,639
Everything is bad, your brother is coming, too

1621
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:46,637
How do you say? Bitch!

1622
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:48,637
Are you crazy?

1623
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:50,637
No, he is just a bit excited

1624
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:51,636
Come on

1625
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:54,638
Let me talk with him

1626
01:23:54,760 --> 01:23:55,636
I want to listen to his voice

1627
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:57,637
Ask him to listen

1628
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:04,637
Come and help me

1629
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:08,638
They will kill me

1630
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:09,636
Please, Noria

1631
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:12,638
Or they will kill me!

1632
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:14,637
You'd better come

1633
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:18,639
Don't bring anybody

1634
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:23,639
I'll be here in one hour

1635
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:26,637
Why do they all go to your place?

1636
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:30,639
You give them keys or they break up the door?

1637
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:31,636
Both

1638
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:33,637
How can?

1639
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:34,636
After I'm out

1640
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:38,639
For the faith, I gave them keys

1641
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:39,636
Then I add a new key

1642
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:43,639
The key is bad, I think they did

1643
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:46,637
You betrayed your brother?

1644
01:24:46,760 --> 01:24:50,639
Come on, one is enough!

1645
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:58,639
I don't hurt Simon

1646
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:02,639
Simon, go to hell!

1647
01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:08,639
I always care about the problem

1648
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:09,636
He is in prison

1649
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:11,637
We are close to each other

1650
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:13,637
I live with him

1651
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:15,636
He really loves me

1652
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:18,638
He is a Muslim

1653
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:20,637
What's the point?

1654
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:24,639
You just know how to misunderstand him

1655
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:49,639
I know what attitude they use to deal with woman

1656
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:54,639
Not bad than us

1657
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:59,639
Noria...

1658
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:17,639
I sleep beside you

1659
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:32,637
That's not my business!

1660
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:33,636
Who are you?

1661
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:34,636
Why beat me?

1662
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:35,636
You are her brother, you must know!

1663
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:37,637
I know nothing!

1664
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:39,637
Shut up, stupid!

1665
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:42,638
Don't talk to him, ok?

1666
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:46,639
We have something to do!

1667
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:48,637
Come on, it's kidnap!

1668
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:50,637
It's time

1669
01:26:57,760 --> 01:26:59,637
If they are in the stairs?

1670
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:01,637
Aicha, do you hear?

1671
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:05,639
I won't come in if it's not my brother who opens the door

1672
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:13,639
I want my brother open the door

1673
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:19,637
Don't be silly

1674
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:23,639
Come in, we can negotiate

1675
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:25,637
Is that negotiation?

1676
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:26,636
That's not my idea...

1677
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:28,637
Don't move

1678
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:31,637
Le me take care of your brother

1679
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:33,637
Do you see what they do?

1680
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:35,637
thanks for keep me here

1681
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:36,636
Whose gun?

1682
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:37,636
Not mine?

1683
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:38,636
Do you want to trap me?

1684
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:42,639
I swear the gun is not mine

1685
01:27:56,760 --> 01:27:58,637
What's that?

1686
01:27:58,760 --> 01:27:59,636
My savings

1687
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:00,636
So many savings

1688
01:28:00,760 --> 01:28:02,637
I struggle for it, legally

1689
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:03,636
Were you amah?

1690
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:06,638
He doubts everyone, including me

1691
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:09,638
Do they use wire?

1692
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:10,636
Yes, 200 volts

1693
01:28:10,760 --> 01:28:12,637
How is your head?

1694
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:13,636
Nothing

1695
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:15,637
Send him to hospital

1696
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:16,636
What did I do?

1697
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:18,637
You will be more sate in my home

1698
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:20,637
No 17, 3rd floors, Dedilace street

1699
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:20,998
Key is here

1700
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:23,637
You know my brother

1701
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:24,636
I saw him in your home

1702
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:25,636
Hello

1703
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:29,639
I need to take back the bag?

1704
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:31,637
Ah? What bag?

1705
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:34,638
Don't tell me you don't know

1706
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:35,636
You are Noria's lawyer

1707
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:38,638
It's you who keeps Noria outside of prison

1708
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:40,637
You know Noria! Know Mangin!

1709
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:41,636
What happened?

1710
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:43,637
Why come to my home at 3am?

1711
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:44,636
What bag?

1712
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:46,637
What's the difference between 3am and 10 am?

1713
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:48,637
We are not scaring you

1714
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:50,637
What does it mean?

1715
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:51,636
You take a seat

1716
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:53,637
Let's talk first, then you can make a phone call

1717
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:57,639
What happened?

1718
01:28:57,760 --> 01:28:58,636
What's the matter?

1719
01:28:58,760 --> 01:29:01,638
You know Noria steal the bag with money and drug

1720
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:02,636
I don't know Noria...

1721
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:05,638
or bag!

1722
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:06,636
What happened?

1723
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:07,636
Is that gun?

1724
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:09,637
I'm lawyer, I'm not bastard

1725
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:11,637
I always tell all I know

1726
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:13,637
Don't cry

1727
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:15,637
We can cry louder than you

1728
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:18,638
You are lawyer all the time

1729
01:29:18,760 --> 01:29:20,637
Now you are a cheater

1730
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:22,637
amphisbaena!

1731
01:29:22,760 --> 01:29:24,637
I don't understand what do you mean

1732
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:26,637
He is a fool

1733
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:28,637
Listen to me, I'm from law society

1734
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:29,636
You will lose your business doing that

1735
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:32,638
He won't pay attention, he is a fool

1736
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:35,638
I'm coming to make it clear

1737
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:38,638
I don't want to have any problem with you and Mangin

1738
01:29:38,760 --> 01:29:40,637
I just come to want my things back

1739
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:42,637
What?

1740
01:29:42,760 --> 01:29:44,637
The bag with drug and money

1741
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:02,636
Any problem?

1742
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:03,636
Aren't you alone?

1743
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:07,639
You are asking or seeing me?

1744
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:15,639
Mangin, I have trouble

1745
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:19,639
What happened?

1746
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:21,637
They act like mad dogs

1747
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:25,639
Noria stole their things and went away

1748
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:28,638
How do you know it was Noria?

1749
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:29,636
They told me

1750
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:31,637
They are abnormal

1751
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:33,637
They think I collude with her

1752
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:35,637
Incredible

1753
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:37,637
They think or know?

1754
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:40,638
No time joking

1755
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:43,638
She is in danger

1756
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:46,638
How much did she take away?

1757
01:30:46,760 --> 01:30:49,638
They said 200 thousand

1758
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:51,637
I'm scared

1759
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:59,639
They will kill her if found her

1760
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:04,639
I must find her

1761
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:09,637
He has detracted the money

1762
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:13,639
They won't find him

1763
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:16,638
I will talk to him, face to face

1764
01:31:16,760 --> 01:31:18,637
Even if I lose my life, I should know the reason

1765
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:20,637
They won't hurt you

1766
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:22,637
They just scare you
I've try to speak for you

1767
01:31:22,760 --> 01:31:24,637
But if they find I can do nothing

1768
01:31:24,760 --> 01:31:26,637
They won't be polite

1769
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:27,636
If they appear, I can't stay and wait for the death

1770
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:30,638
I have gun, I will deal with them with gun

1771
01:31:30,760 --> 01:31:31,636
Don't say that

1772
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:32,636
I'm not warning you

1773
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:33,636
I'm not good at shoot

1774
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,637
The hurt won't be too much

1775
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:37,637
That's gift

1776
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:40,638
They give me the gun

1777
01:31:40,760 --> 01:31:42,637
Are you crazy!

1778
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:43,636
Why accept such gift?

1779
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:47,639
You shouldn't accept such gift

1780
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:56,637
I haven't wear clothes yet

1781
01:31:56,760 --> 01:32:00,639
I think it's safe here

1782
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:02,636
I want to talk to you

1783
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:06,639
They dare to kill policeman

1784
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:10,638
You know how to shot to pretect yourself

1785
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:12,637
Of course I know

1786
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:17,639
I never shoot

1787
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:21,639
Why not find Ren¨¦?

1788
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:27,637
Kidding?

1789
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:31,638
That's put sheep to the mouth of tiger

1790
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:35,639
They are angry with me

1791
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:39,637
Coz I can't bail Simon out

1792
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:41,637
Nothing can be achieved...

1793
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:43,637
I'm finished

1794
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:45,637
You'd better go

1795
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:48,638
I have done something wrong

1796
01:32:48,760 --> 01:32:50,637
I shouldn't sleep with the woman

1797
01:32:50,760 --> 01:32:51,636
She is a bitch

1798
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:53,637
I shouldn't sleep with her

1799
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:57,639
She is a cheater

1800
01:33:06,760 --> 01:33:08,637
What are you doing?

1801
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:11,637
Are you crazy

1802
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:15,637
Let me tell you

1803
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:18,636
Listen to me

1804
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:20,637
You are mad

1805
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:23,637
Shut up!

1806
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:26,638
Shut up and close the door

1807
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:28,637
Did Simon tell you where is the goods

1808
01:33:28,760 --> 01:33:30,637
No one knows

1809
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:35,639
Not in Aicha, not in their mother's either

1810
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:45,639
He knew you pocketed it

1811
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:48,638
Don't speak to me like a policeman

1812
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:52,639
Did you take it?

1813
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:57,639
Is it important any more?

1814
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:07,637
Whom I care about is you

1815
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:11,639
You care about nothing

1816
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:21,637
Did you take the money?

1817
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:23,637
No...

1818
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:30,637
They will kill you

1819
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:32,637
They won't let you go

1820
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:34,637
No, you won't! You are the worst

1821
01:34:34,760 --> 01:34:36,637
Ridiculous

1822
01:34:36,760 --> 01:34:38,637
I'm the enemy of them

1823
01:34:38,760 --> 01:34:39,636
What I care about it's true

1824
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:43,639
Why do you usually cheat me?

1825
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:45,637
Why?

1826
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:49,637
Do you understand?

1827
01:34:54,760 --> 01:34:55,636
I always lie

1828
01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:57,637
I lie all my life

1829
01:34:57,760 --> 01:34:58,636
Cheat teacher in the school

1830
01:34:58,760 --> 01:34:59,636
Cheat my brother

1831
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:03,639
My family, anybody

1832
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:13,637
My family thought I'm studying lodging school

1833
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:16,638
Noria is just the name Simon renamed for me

1834
01:35:16,760 --> 01:35:19,638
I cheated him

1835
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:20,636
I think I love him

1836
01:35:20,760 --> 01:35:24,639
Simon, his brother, Ren¨¦...

1837
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:30,638
They don't care if we tell the truth

1838
01:35:30,760 --> 01:35:34,639
Arab have their habit

1839
01:35:34,760 --> 01:35:36,637
their truth

1840
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:40,638
But they seems cheating

1841
01:35:40,760 --> 01:35:42,637
I like that

1842
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:44,636
Actually they want to kill you

1843
01:35:44,760 --> 01:35:47,638
You won't kill anybody tonight

1844
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:51,639
But others will, they will

1845
01:35:57,760 --> 01:36:01,639
Money is in the storeroom in the central station

1846
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:07,639
I know you are silly to do this, but it's late

1847
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:14,638
Do you love Lambert?

1848
01:36:14,760 --> 01:36:16,637
No

1849
01:36:22,760 --> 01:36:26,639
Can you let me be a policeman's wife?

1850
01:36:26,760 --> 01:36:30,639
Then what do you do tonight?

1851
01:36:36,760 --> 01:36:40,639
Nothing for tonight

1852
01:36:40,760 --> 01:36:42,637
Nothing?

1853
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:47,637
How else?

1854
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:50,637
Do you dream of being in the beach with palm?

1855
01:36:50,760 --> 01:36:54,639
With many waiters serving you

1856
01:36:54,760 --> 01:36:58,639
To me, it's heaven 

1857
01:36:58,760 --> 01:37:00,637
Let go the things of beach

1858
01:37:00,760 --> 01:37:03,638
But you can't go into the water

1859
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:07,639
There are coral and shark

1860
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:09,637
Then you hurry

1861
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:11,637
It's too bad of that kind of life

1862
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:13,637
Of course

1863
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:17,639
Searching, Waiting, tracking, that's the job

1864
01:37:18,760 --> 01:37:20,637
You shouldn't do that, shouldn't like them

1865
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:22,637
Money, money!

1866
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:26,638
They only know how to rob and bet!

1867
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:29,638
I'm not too nervous about money

1868
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:32,638
Will you advice me turn the money back?

1869
01:37:32,760 --> 01:37:36,639
You are as silly as them

1870
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:40,638
I broke them down and the drug

1871
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:44,639
Coz I got the goods

1872
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:51,639
I don't do with you

1873
01:37:52,760 --> 01:37:56,639
You have nothing

1874
01:37:56,760 --> 01:38:00,639
I have nothing

1875
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:13,639
We should find another bastard

1876
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:23,639
You think it is funny

1877
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:55,637
Give me the bag

1878
01:38:56,760 --> 01:38:57,636
Where?

1879
01:38:57,760 --> 01:39:01,639
There, your feet

1880
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:07,637
Wait for me here

1881
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:23,639
Policeman keeping promise

1882
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:27,639
Mangin, 

1883
01:39:32,760 --> 01:39:35,638
That's the most important

1884
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:37,637
Keep promise

1885
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:45,637
Sorry

1886
01:39:45,760 --> 01:39:48,638
All are there

1887
01:39:48,760 --> 01:39:50,637
Think for a while!

1888
01:39:52,760 --> 01:39:54,637
Will, Mangin!

1889
01:39:55,760 --> 01:39:57,637
Thanks

1890
01:39:57,760 --> 01:39:58,636
If you need help, ask me

1891
01:39:58,760 --> 01:40:00,637
I will, bye

1892
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:03,637
Good night, Mangin

1893
01:40:06,760 --> 01:40:07,636
Are you satisfied?

1894
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:10,638
I'm satisfied with the money

1895
01:40:10,760 --> 01:40:14,639
But who knows he has any plan!

1896
01:40:18,760 --> 01:40:20,637
Mr. policeman!

1897
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:23,637
Come here!

1898
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:26,638
No wander, do you remember it?

1899
01:40:26,760 --> 01:40:28,637
Have a cup

1900
01:40:28,760 --> 01:40:30,637
What's this?

1901
01:40:30,760 --> 01:40:31,636
Distilled spirit...

1902
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:33,637
No, whisky

1903
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:34,636
What are you doing here?

1904
01:40:34,760 --> 01:40:36,637
They set you free?

1905
01:40:36,760 --> 01:40:38,637
I'm innocent

1906
01:40:38,760 --> 01:40:40,637
Can't stop you beating me!

1907
01:40:40,760 --> 01:40:41,636
But you can't?

1908
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:43,637
Jpw about your wife and children?

1909
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:46,638
Only 7 to 10 days

1910
01:40:46,760 --> 01:40:47,636
Again?

1911
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:48,636
Yes

1912
01:40:48,760 --> 01:40:51,638
Where is another rattoo?

1913
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:53,637
I will find the place

1914
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:54,636
Which name you would change to?

1915
01:40:54,760 --> 01:40:55,636
Yuxun

1916
01:40:55,760 --> 01:40:57,637
That's my middle name

1917
01:40:57,760 --> 01:41:01,639
Louis.Yuxun.Mangin

1918
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:03,637
She wants to call him Stephin

1919
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:06,638
But that's fucking name, isn't it?

1920
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:09,638
If girl?

1921
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:10,636
Can't be girl

1922
01:41:10,760 --> 01:41:12,637
She checked

1923
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:14,636
No, it's boy

1924
01:41:14,760 --> 01:41:18,639
Yes, if boy

1925
01:41:18,760 --> 01:41:19,636
yes

1926
01:41:19,760 --> 01:41:21,637
Will you go back to sleep tonight?

1927
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:24,638
My woman knows I'm here

1928
01:41:24,760 --> 01:41:25,636
She trusts me very much now

1929
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:28,638
I seldom go out

1930
01:41:28,760 --> 01:41:29,636
I've been much quiet

1931
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:31,034
Goodbye

1932
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:47,637
I'm leaving

1933
01:41:48,760 --> 01:41:51,638
I supposed you will say that sooner or later

1934
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:53,637
But I think...

1935
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:55,637
You will say it with anger

1936
01:41:55,760 --> 01:41:58,638
Now matter how, you won't understand

1937
01:41:58,760 --> 01:42:02,639
The end is just galling

1938
01:42:02,760 --> 01:42:06,639
My mother finds something wrong

1939
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:10,638
But we need to sleep

1940
01:42:10,760 --> 01:42:12,637
I'm tired, too

1941
01:42:12,760 --> 01:42:16,639
It will be clear later

1942
01:42:18,760 --> 01:42:21,638
Do you think sleep can solve the problem?

1943
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:23,637
Yes, because you are tired

1944
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:24,636
I'm not tired

1945
01:42:24,760 --> 01:42:26,637
You are so tired

1946
01:42:26,760 --> 01:42:28,637
No tend to continue at all

1947
01:42:28,760 --> 01:42:29,636
Things have past

1948
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:33,639
No, not past

1949
01:42:36,760 --> 01:42:40,639
I can't live with you
You must be disappointed

1950
01:42:42,760 --> 01:42:46,639
I can't fulfill man's need

1951
01:42:46,760 --> 01:42:50,639
You teach me not to cheat
I just think you can love me

1952
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:55,639
Just so simple
I'm good at love

1953
01:42:56,760 --> 01:42:59,638
Maybe I'm too young

1954
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:03,639
You are still strong like before

1955
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:05,637
Immoral!

1956
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:09,639
You won't care about anything

1957
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:12,638
Like a sealed tower

1958
01:43:12,760 --> 01:43:16,639
Nothing can touch you

1959
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:19,637
That's why I leave you

1960
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:22,638
Do you think they will let you go?

1961
01:43:22,760 --> 01:43:25,638
They have taken back the money

1962
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:28,638
That won't satisfy them

1963
01:43:28,760 --> 01:43:31,638
They are niggards

1964
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:34,638
They only killed several people in ten years

1965
01:43:34,760 --> 01:43:37,638
They won't come to me

1966
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:40,638
They always said

1967
01:43:40,760 --> 01:43:42,637
(Mountains never collide)

1968
01:43:42,760 --> 01:43:45,638
They won't hurt me

1969
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:49,639
One month, one year...

1970
01:43:50,760 --> 01:43:51,636
You are not the same as them

1971
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:52,636
How do you know?

1972
01:43:52,760 --> 01:43:55,638
Everyone said policeman and thief are the same

1973
01:43:55,760 --> 01:43:59,639
You don't afraid of me, I won't care

1974
01:44:00,760 --> 01:44:04,639
I just do things I like

1975
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:11,637
Kiss me goodbye

1976
01:44:14,760 --> 01:44:18,639
Noria, let it go

1977
01:44:20,760 --> 01:44:22,637
Kiss

1978
01:44:22,760 --> 01:44:24,637
No

1979
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:31,639
You want to suppress your love to me?

1980
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:35,637
I'm very sure

1981
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:53,637
The End
