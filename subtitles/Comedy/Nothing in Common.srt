1
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:32,644
- You've done this before. Obviously.
- No.

2
00:00:32,849 --> 00:00:34,965
Oh, God. Obviously.

3
00:00:35,729 --> 00:00:38,448
- I have to go back to work.
- No.

4
00:00:38,729 --> 00:00:41,766
- You don't have to go to work.
- Yes, I do.

5
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:43,925
- It's time.
- No, no.

6
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:46,518
Wait a minute. Just...

7
00:00:46,729 --> 00:00:48,799
Just give me 10 minutes more.

8
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:51,364
Fifteen, 20 minutes more?
Come on.

9
00:00:51,609 --> 00:00:54,760
- I want to show you something.
- What?

10
00:00:54,969 --> 00:00:56,960
What's this?
How does this work?

11
00:00:57,169 --> 00:00:59,319
Am I supposed to twist it
or something?

12
00:00:59,569 --> 00:01:00,843
Was that you?

13
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:03,244
We're experiencing turbulence.

14
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:05,644
Please fasten your seat belts.

15
00:01:06,169 --> 00:01:08,125
Can you get me a cup of coffee?

16
00:01:08,329 --> 00:01:10,843
- No problem.
- Prepare for landing.

17
00:01:11,129 --> 00:01:14,439
I have to get to work.
We'll land in 30 minutes.

18
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:22,563
I'm a frequent flyer,
I got a bonus.

19
00:01:23,409 --> 00:01:24,478
Good morning.

20
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:28,807
We are approaching Chicago's
O'Hare International Airport.

21
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:34,037
Please extinguish all cigarettes.
Return seats to the upright position.

22
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:41,878
The local time is 8:10 am.

23
00:01:42,089 --> 00:01:45,764
On behalf of our crew, thank you
for flying Trans Allied...

24
00:01:45,969 --> 00:01:49,325
...the official airline
of the Indiana Pacers.

25
00:03:44,009 --> 00:03:47,365
- Sign for no lights at Wrigley Field.
- I've signed.

26
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:49,560
No lights at Wrigley Field.

27
00:03:49,809 --> 00:03:52,448
From Davenport?
One of the quad cities?

28
00:03:52,689 --> 00:03:55,567
Twice as good as the Twin Cities.
Good luck.

29
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:57,919
Matty and Matty,
maintenance men.

30
00:03:58,129 --> 00:04:01,644
What are the odds of that?
Two Mattys in one building.

31
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:03,999
Polly, still pushing grapes.

32
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:06,723
Is she filling out an application?

33
00:04:06,929 --> 00:04:10,205
Don't! It's hell through these doors!

34
00:04:10,409 --> 00:04:14,197
Hi, Kathy. Tell that lady
the truth about advertising.

35
00:04:14,409 --> 00:04:15,888
BG and L hell!

36
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:19,047
Here's the guys
who are working very hard.

37
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:22,927
Right inside.
It's all I can spare today.

38
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:24,687
- Thanks, dude.
- Mr. Basner.

39
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:28,325
Two examples for labor laws.
Check out the talent.

40
00:04:28,529 --> 00:04:30,645
I'm back! Remember me?

41
00:04:31,089 --> 00:04:33,444
They're in there.
Thanks, Donovan.

42
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:36,368
Here's a gift from the Bahamas.
Why?

43
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:40,084
Because you crack me up.
You make me laugh.

44
00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:42,883
Is this red tie day?
Nobody told me.

45
00:04:43,089 --> 00:04:46,365
- Bloody Friday.
- Hear what happened to Clemens?

46
00:04:46,609 --> 00:04:49,521
- He got terminated.
- We fired Clemens?

47
00:04:49,729 --> 00:04:51,367
I'm sorry to hear that.

48
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:54,244
He was an asshole. Come on.

49
00:04:54,449 --> 00:04:56,883
- Dave? How are you?
- All right.

50
00:04:57,089 --> 00:04:59,523
Congratulations on the promotion.

51
00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:03,358
That's big of you.
Is today your birthday?

52
00:05:04,089 --> 00:05:07,638
- Welcome back, Basner.
- You want to see my tan line?

53
00:05:07,929 --> 00:05:12,081
Clemens is gone. Rumor has it
he stored drugs in his cubicle.

54
00:05:12,289 --> 00:05:14,564
- Slice his chair.
- Get airport dogs.

55
00:05:14,729 --> 00:05:17,243
Doris, did you miss me? Of course.

56
00:05:19,009 --> 00:05:21,603
Thanks for the quickie.
You wear me out.

57
00:05:21,809 --> 00:05:23,686
Put it out. I see the smoke.

58
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:27,404
Where are our best and brightest?
Our creative aspect.

59
00:05:27,649 --> 00:05:30,641
- The boss is back.
- You don't check anything.

60
00:05:30,849 --> 00:05:32,726
Welcome back, Mr. Basner.

61
00:05:32,929 --> 00:05:37,241
You have 10 urgent messages,
but you're due in the conference room.

62
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:39,804
Get this fixed. It almost killed me.

63
00:05:40,009 --> 00:05:43,240
- Who's got a team?
- We got a team!

64
00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:45,724
Dale, Rick, Brian, Cameron, Mishi...

65
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:49,717
- Who knows where your lips have been.
- How's the Bahamas?

66
00:05:49,929 --> 00:05:52,887
You wouldn't like diving.
You can't smoke.

67
00:05:53,089 --> 00:05:56,047
This is adorable.
Brian, that was great.

68
00:05:56,249 --> 00:05:58,240
- Who locked it?
- It's a joke.

69
00:05:58,529 --> 00:06:01,089
It's an office.
Let's lose the plant.

70
00:06:01,289 --> 00:06:04,679
- Look at this. It's a man's desk!
- Bring any presents?

71
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:06,766
I have gifts for all...

72
00:06:06,969 --> 00:06:11,360
...including a figurehead
from a ship 300 feet below the sea.

73
00:06:11,609 --> 00:06:13,088
That's for me. What?

74
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:16,281
An office with a window.

75
00:06:37,929 --> 00:06:42,047
Oh, for me? This is lovely!
We don't handle these people.

76
00:06:42,249 --> 00:06:44,763
I can see traffic accidents.

77
00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:46,880
- Okay, staff!
- Listen up.

78
00:06:47,089 --> 00:06:50,525
Guys and gals,
the first order of business is: Out.

79
00:06:50,849 --> 00:06:52,077
No work right now.

80
00:06:52,289 --> 00:06:54,359
I love short meetings.

81
00:06:54,609 --> 00:06:57,760
I went shopping.
New office, clothes, new image.

82
00:06:57,969 --> 00:07:00,608
- We have a meeting.
- I won't forget.

83
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:38,048
Talk to me about it.
Somebody, anybody.

84
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,001
The account loves it.

85
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:43,997
Tests show it does big.
Especially in our target, Europe.

86
00:07:44,209 --> 00:07:47,645
- You do nice work.
- He should, with that raise.

87
00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:50,608
That's it. Thank you very much.
Let's go.

88
00:07:50,809 --> 00:07:52,367
Now, about that lunch...

89
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:56,762
No, do that, and put the memo
on my desk in my new office.

90
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:58,727
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

91
00:07:58,929 --> 00:08:01,841
Donovan, play that back for me, okay?

92
00:08:05,249 --> 00:08:07,604
No, don't, Donovan.
David...

93
00:08:07,809 --> 00:08:11,119
...I know you've received
two offers from agencies.

94
00:08:11,329 --> 00:08:14,321
Decline, or I'll
throw you out your window.

95
00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:16,878
Why? They won't make me a partner.

96
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:18,608
Partner?

97
00:08:19,049 --> 00:08:21,802
Boile, Gargas, Lionel and Basner?

98
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:24,364
Like John, Paul, George and Ringo.

99
00:08:24,609 --> 00:08:27,885
- You're pretty cocky.
- No, just pretty capable.

100
00:08:28,369 --> 00:08:31,202
In creating cute
and flashy commercials.

101
00:08:32,009 --> 00:08:36,321
- You have to bring in new accounts.
- Just watch me.

102
00:08:37,129 --> 00:08:39,563
Here's one. Make it up right there.

103
00:08:43,329 --> 00:08:44,808
You pay him!

104
00:08:45,009 --> 00:08:48,922
- I'm dancing, I'm not embarrassed.
- You're drunk.

105
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:50,767
I'm having a drink.

106
00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:52,964
Run it by.

107
00:08:53,609 --> 00:08:55,759
Yo, Davey!

108
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:57,800
Meet Sheila and Louise.

109
00:08:58,009 --> 00:08:59,442
- Louise.
- Great.

110
00:08:59,649 --> 00:09:02,038
Did you lose the wedding ring?

111
00:09:02,249 --> 00:09:05,127
- This is Sam.
- Nice to meet you.

112
00:09:05,609 --> 00:09:09,079
I'm glad you got the job. I mean it.

113
00:09:09,289 --> 00:09:12,361
- Will you drive him?
- What will I tell my folks?

114
00:09:13,369 --> 00:09:16,042
- Jo-Jo, give me a stout.
- Beer's on us.

115
00:09:16,649 --> 00:09:19,004
Thank you. Hey, nice... What?

116
00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:22,167
- Burnett Agency hot shots.
- Jo-Jo's on it.

117
00:09:22,369 --> 00:09:24,519
That's why you're the boss.

118
00:09:25,889 --> 00:09:29,438
Some big outfit
wants to switch ad agencies.

119
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:32,322
What big outfit?
Their computer line? Cosmetics?

120
00:09:32,569 --> 00:09:35,037
- It's an airline.
- Well, which one?

121
00:09:35,249 --> 00:09:38,844
- I'll drop a microphone in the drinks.
- Just find out.

122
00:09:39,049 --> 00:09:43,008
- I'll fix you up with Cameron, okay?
- Yeah.

123
00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:45,359
Just don't be too obvious.

124
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:48,641
Go easy on him.
I need him at the office.

125
00:09:48,849 --> 00:09:49,918
Another round?

126
00:09:51,689 --> 00:09:53,680
I gotta run. Got a hot date.

127
00:09:53,889 --> 00:09:55,288
I wanna talk to you.

128
00:09:57,729 --> 00:09:59,208
Keep your mouth shut.

129
00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:11,362
- Wait. Can we talk a minute?
- No, we can't.

130
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:15,164
You said you liked scuba-diving
and raced seahorses.

131
00:10:15,369 --> 00:10:17,325
- Yes, I did.
- And you like...

132
00:10:19,689 --> 00:10:22,362
Tell me, are you involved
with anybody?

133
00:10:22,609 --> 00:10:24,088
Yes. No. Well...

134
00:10:24,329 --> 00:10:26,445
Does self-involved count?

135
00:10:28,649 --> 00:10:30,162
No phone calls.

136
00:10:30,369 --> 00:10:33,406
I left express orders
not to be disturbed.

137
00:10:33,969 --> 00:10:35,118
I'm David Basner.

138
00:10:35,329 --> 00:10:38,207
I'm looking for new
voiceover talent.

139
00:10:38,409 --> 00:10:41,082
You could be it
if I like your audition.

140
00:10:41,289 --> 00:10:43,723
Leave your name and number.
Action.

141
00:10:44,169 --> 00:10:45,648
It's Max.

142
00:10:45,849 --> 00:10:50,445
Max Basner, your father.
Maybe you heard of me.

143
00:10:50,689 --> 00:10:54,762
I thought you'd like to know
your mother left me today.

144
00:10:57,329 --> 00:10:59,843
- What?
- Oh, you're there.

145
00:11:00,049 --> 00:11:03,359
Yeah, I'm here.
What is this about Mom?

146
00:11:03,609 --> 00:11:06,407
You got a girl there?
Anybody you knew?

147
00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:08,526
Funny. What's this about Mom?

148
00:11:08,729 --> 00:11:10,287
I'm not talking English?

149
00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:13,885
Thirty-six years of marriage,
and she walks out.

150
00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:18,128
She took clothes.
She took pots, pans, the blender.

151
00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:21,048
It's 12:00 at night, and I'm alone...

152
00:11:21,249 --> 00:11:25,401
...with a meatloaf in tinfoil.
- It's a misunderstanding.

153
00:11:25,609 --> 00:11:27,679
It's not a misunderstanding.

154
00:11:27,889 --> 00:11:31,928
A misunderstanding, you take
a toothbrush, not the blender.

155
00:11:32,129 --> 00:11:34,040
Look, I'm...

156
00:11:34,249 --> 00:11:37,719
I'm in the middle of something.
Can I call you back?

157
00:11:47,449 --> 00:11:49,326
Did your mom leave your dad?

158
00:11:49,889 --> 00:11:51,527
I guess so.

159
00:11:55,369 --> 00:11:58,600
People just can't seem to
relate anymore.

160
00:12:09,689 --> 00:12:10,599
Bye-bye.

161
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:19,361
Hello, Mrs. Packanak.
How are the birds?

162
00:12:34,009 --> 00:12:35,965
- Who is it?
- David.

163
00:12:36,169 --> 00:12:38,239
You know where the key is.

164
00:12:55,129 --> 00:12:56,528
Good morning.

165
00:13:06,249 --> 00:13:07,762
You all right?

166
00:13:08,009 --> 00:13:10,079
Never felt better.

167
00:13:14,809 --> 00:13:16,527
So, what's going on?

168
00:13:16,969 --> 00:13:21,281
I got a horse here that cannot lose.

169
00:13:22,249 --> 00:13:26,003
- Am I crazy, or is something burning?
- You're going crazy.

170
00:13:27,409 --> 00:13:30,640
You like what your mother did
with the furniture?

171
00:13:31,369 --> 00:13:33,007
Your mother's a thief.

172
00:13:33,209 --> 00:13:36,918
She took the sofa,
the easy chair, the dining table.

173
00:13:37,129 --> 00:13:39,359
I gotta eat off the card table.

174
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:42,083
I shuffled the toast this morning.

175
00:13:43,809 --> 00:13:45,242
What is this?

176
00:13:46,769 --> 00:13:48,202
It's a steak.

177
00:13:50,809 --> 00:13:53,846
Here, I'll make another one
for myself.

178
00:13:54,049 --> 00:13:56,324
What's with you and Mom?

179
00:13:56,529 --> 00:14:01,045
I can never find the ketchup.
Where does she hide the ketchup?

180
00:14:01,929 --> 00:14:04,648
I haven't lived here in 10 years.

181
00:14:04,849 --> 00:14:08,603
She kept the peanut butter
on the top shelf. Try there.

182
00:14:09,089 --> 00:14:10,078
Here it is.

183
00:14:10,289 --> 00:14:13,645
Your mother hated me using ketchup.
She couldn't cook.

184
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:17,768
You know, the dog didn't die.
He committed suicide.

185
00:14:18,409 --> 00:14:20,559
Now that's a piece of meat.

186
00:14:20,769 --> 00:14:22,839
Want anything for breakfast?

187
00:14:24,969 --> 00:14:26,448
So...

188
00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:28,162
...Mom left?

189
00:14:28,369 --> 00:14:30,405
Do you see anyone else here?

190
00:14:31,249 --> 00:14:34,878
Will you tell me, or are we
gonna play 20 questions?

191
00:14:35,849 --> 00:14:38,921
I told you.
She walked out, she left.

192
00:14:39,529 --> 00:14:41,281
Do you know where she is?

193
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:43,042
Who cares?

194
00:14:44,529 --> 00:14:46,759
I'm better off without her.

195
00:14:47,849 --> 00:14:50,568
She was some bundle of fun, that one.

196
00:14:50,769 --> 00:14:53,408
My sides still hurt from laughing.

197
00:14:54,689 --> 00:14:57,920
It's not your problem.
I won't waste your time.

198
00:14:58,129 --> 00:14:59,881
Be fair.

199
00:15:00,209 --> 00:15:04,327
I hear from you three times.
For Christmas, hockey tickets...

200
00:15:04,569 --> 00:15:07,288
...and "your mother has left me."

201
00:15:07,529 --> 00:15:10,726
You wanna leave.
You been here 10 minutes already.

202
00:15:11,129 --> 00:15:13,438
Got a blond on the other pillow?

203
00:15:13,689 --> 00:15:16,965
A redhead in jeans
with the name across the ass?

204
00:15:17,289 --> 00:15:21,123
When I was a kid we didn't need
a name, just an ass.

205
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:25,200
Go on, get out of here.

206
00:15:59,969 --> 00:16:01,607
Cut! Cut!

207
00:16:01,809 --> 00:16:03,208
What is going on here?!

208
00:16:03,569 --> 00:16:05,366
What's down here?

209
00:16:05,609 --> 00:16:08,442
- Why are my glasses on the set?
- What?

210
00:16:08,689 --> 00:16:10,884
Listen honey, it's "Jeu de paume."

211
00:16:11,089 --> 00:16:13,649
- It's not "Jeu de roller-derby."
- He moved.

212
00:16:13,849 --> 00:16:16,602
You're ripping his face off.
Take five.

213
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,083
Take a break.

214
00:16:18,289 --> 00:16:19,961
Seven minutes to lunch?

215
00:16:20,169 --> 00:16:23,320
You said yes to the Sony,
no to the drunk driving.

216
00:16:23,569 --> 00:16:25,639
- Jane wants you.
- I'll be back.

217
00:16:25,849 --> 00:16:28,647
- Talk to me.
- Lunch at Spiages.

218
00:16:28,849 --> 00:16:31,124
The no-tie meeting's at 2:30.

219
00:16:31,329 --> 00:16:33,638
- Donna call?
- I left three messages.

220
00:16:33,849 --> 00:16:36,363
Someone claiming to be your mother...

221
00:16:36,569 --> 00:16:39,686
- Wait. My mother?
- She said she was.

222
00:16:39,889 --> 00:16:42,403
I didn't know you had parents.

223
00:16:42,649 --> 00:16:45,766
- Get her on the phone.
- There's just an address.

224
00:16:45,969 --> 00:16:48,722
I've got seven layouts.

225
00:16:48,929 --> 00:16:51,204
Rog, we can't break this long.

226
00:16:51,409 --> 00:16:54,128
- Break's over.
- Thanks. Just nod at me.

227
00:16:54,329 --> 00:16:58,686
The client sees me telling you
that smoke won't cover the product.

228
00:16:58,889 --> 00:17:01,164
Find out exactly where this is.

229
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:19,047
I rented the apartment from Lucille.

230
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:22,526
She was our cleaning lady
when you were 6.

231
00:17:22,729 --> 00:17:25,243
My mind was cluttered when I was 6.

232
00:17:26,009 --> 00:17:29,081
- Say hello to Lucille, David.
- Hello, David.

233
00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:31,325
- Good seeing you.
- You too.

234
00:17:31,569 --> 00:17:34,447
- Meet my husband, Arthur.
- How do you do?

235
00:17:35,729 --> 00:17:37,799
Oh, yeah, I remember Lucille.

236
00:17:38,009 --> 00:17:40,000
She was a little taller.

237
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:45,121
After 36 years of being married,
you pretend it didn't happen?

238
00:17:45,329 --> 00:17:46,967
Is that it, Mom?

239
00:17:52,689 --> 00:17:54,839
Is that what your father said?

240
00:17:55,049 --> 00:17:57,722
I just walked out all of a sudden?

241
00:17:58,409 --> 00:18:01,401
No, he didn't.
We just looked for ketchup.

242
00:18:01,649 --> 00:18:06,040
You don't know what it was like
since you moved away.

243
00:18:06,529 --> 00:18:08,759
There was nobody to talk to.

244
00:18:08,969 --> 00:18:12,325
He came home
and there was still nobody to talk to.

245
00:18:12,569 --> 00:18:16,847
I'd check his club chair.
That's how I knew he was home.

246
00:18:17,049 --> 00:18:22,043
I didn't leave because of the yelling.
I left because of the silence.

247
00:18:22,249 --> 00:18:25,127
You don't have to tell me
the whole thing.

248
00:18:27,409 --> 00:18:31,721
It took every ounce of courage
I could muster to walk out.

249
00:18:46,729 --> 00:18:47,878
That's right.

250
00:18:48,129 --> 00:18:51,007
Who can say that amoebas
don't make noise?

251
00:18:51,209 --> 00:18:55,407
The point of this acting exercise
is uninhibited body motion...

252
00:18:55,649 --> 00:18:57,924
...speech, sound.

253
00:18:59,969 --> 00:19:02,164
Open it up!

254
00:19:02,889 --> 00:19:07,963
Michael over here is making
very, very good amoeba noises.

255
00:19:08,249 --> 00:19:11,764
- Zachary, Nancy, what are you doing?
- Making baby amoebas.

256
00:19:11,969 --> 00:19:15,928
- You wouldn't know how.
- I'd prefer asexual reproduction...

257
00:19:16,129 --> 00:19:18,518
...if you don't mind. Thank you.

258
00:19:18,729 --> 00:19:21,289
Is this a required class, Amoebas 101?

259
00:19:21,529 --> 00:19:23,997
- David.
- Professor Donna Martin.

260
00:19:24,529 --> 00:19:27,327
Fancy seeing you here, or anywhere.

261
00:19:28,569 --> 00:19:29,968
Open it up.

262
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,400
Open it up.
Use your vocal capacity.

263
00:19:33,649 --> 00:19:38,598
- Did I forget something?
- You promised to come to my play.

264
00:19:38,809 --> 00:19:42,199
Just admit that you hate
experimental theater.

265
00:19:42,409 --> 00:19:44,127
- That's not true.
- You do.

266
00:19:44,329 --> 00:19:47,958
I did an experiment to see
if I could enjoy it without...

267
00:19:48,169 --> 00:19:51,127
...actually being in the theater.

268
00:19:51,769 --> 00:19:53,168
I'm sorry.

269
00:19:53,849 --> 00:19:56,727
No foreign amoebas, please.

270
00:19:58,769 --> 00:20:00,043
Better.

271
00:20:01,449 --> 00:20:04,088
Are we working you too hard, Bubba?

272
00:20:04,289 --> 00:20:07,725
- All right, take five.
- I gotta go to the bathroom.

273
00:20:07,929 --> 00:20:10,204
There's a lot I'd like to get to...

274
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:14,163
...so let's make this
a 15-minute "take five," please.

275
00:20:14,369 --> 00:20:16,758
Very nice. Good amoeba-ing.

276
00:20:17,089 --> 00:20:18,647
Nice. Very good.

277
00:20:18,849 --> 00:20:20,407
Oh, good book?

278
00:20:20,609 --> 00:20:22,884
You were the best, Bubba.
So far.

279
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:25,557
Ms. Martin, is he your boyfriend?

280
00:20:26,329 --> 00:20:29,446
He's an old flame,
an old high-school flame.

281
00:20:29,969 --> 00:20:33,757
This is what you
want to avoid later in life.

282
00:20:37,649 --> 00:20:39,367
I don't know, David.

283
00:20:39,569 --> 00:20:42,402
My parents were divorced
when I was 10.

284
00:20:42,969 --> 00:20:46,848
My mom said:
"Don't live in the same city as your parents."

285
00:20:47,049 --> 00:20:50,439
What crappy advice.
I can't get my parents to move.

286
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:54,198
I didn't mean that they should move.
I meant...

287
00:20:54,729 --> 00:20:56,845
You know what my scenario was?

288
00:20:57,049 --> 00:21:00,519
I was gonna move away
into a luxurious mansion...

289
00:21:00,729 --> 00:21:02,606
...and they'd visit me once.

290
00:21:02,809 --> 00:21:05,369
"What a nice mansion. We love you."

291
00:21:05,609 --> 00:21:09,807
I'd say, "I love you too."
Then they would go away and die.

292
00:21:11,049 --> 00:21:13,005
Does this make me an asshole?

293
00:21:13,209 --> 00:21:16,201
My ex-husband, Hank,
he was an asshole.

294
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:17,637
You're just...

295
00:21:17,849 --> 00:21:20,647
Childish, immature, selfish?
I am.

296
00:21:20,849 --> 00:21:23,409
I make a lot for being this way.

297
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:26,402
It is economically unsound to grow up.

298
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:31,117
If I did grow up and became an adult,
what would I do?

299
00:21:41,449 --> 00:21:43,644
Good afternoon, Nat.

300
00:21:43,849 --> 00:21:46,044
Hi, Max. Got any tips for me?

301
00:21:46,249 --> 00:21:48,843
Don't go swimming after a heavy meal.

302
00:21:49,049 --> 00:21:51,688
I have girlie pictures
I wanna show you.

303
00:21:51,889 --> 00:21:55,086
If they're as bad as last week,
keep them.

304
00:21:55,729 --> 00:21:59,927
Mr. Young, a prune Danish
and a seltzer.

305
00:22:00,129 --> 00:22:01,960
You got it, Max.

306
00:22:08,729 --> 00:22:10,685
- Hello, Max.
- Hey, Sal.

307
00:22:10,889 --> 00:22:13,403
- How's your wife?
- She's fine.

308
00:22:13,649 --> 00:22:17,403
Send her my best, even though
I know she never liked me.

309
00:22:17,649 --> 00:22:20,209
She never liked me either.

310
00:22:20,809 --> 00:22:24,927
He's a riot. Max Basner,
last of the old-time salesmen.

311
00:22:26,249 --> 00:22:27,364
The pens arrived.

312
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:35,768
- "Stolen from the desk..."
- "Of Max Basner."

313
00:22:37,129 --> 00:22:38,801
It just so happens...

314
00:22:39,009 --> 00:22:41,887
...that this is a great sales gimmick.

315
00:22:42,409 --> 00:22:44,559
It's also a way to meet women.

316
00:22:44,769 --> 00:22:47,408
If you were as interested in sales...

317
00:22:47,649 --> 00:22:51,005
...we'd all be rich!
- Don't you dare yell at me.

318
00:22:51,289 --> 00:22:53,519
You're talking to Max Basner.

319
00:22:55,209 --> 00:22:59,043
I've been a top salesman
in this company for 35 years.

320
00:22:59,249 --> 00:23:01,240
Okay. I'm sorry, Max.

321
00:23:01,529 --> 00:23:06,649
Mr. Keenan from New York
has been on me. Just do better, Max.

322
00:23:07,409 --> 00:23:10,321
Okay? Just do better.

323
00:23:32,569 --> 00:23:34,241
Over here, boss.

324
00:23:34,809 --> 00:23:39,200
- Let's hit the pool.
- Wait, first close your eyes.

325
00:23:41,049 --> 00:23:43,165
I want an honest opinion.

326
00:23:43,369 --> 00:23:46,281
- Who are you grateful to?
- You, Charlie Gargas.

327
00:23:46,529 --> 00:23:48,759
Open your eyes and don't laugh.

328
00:23:50,089 --> 00:23:51,761
Oh, it's you.

329
00:23:52,169 --> 00:23:54,399
- I don't look dumb in this?
- No.

330
00:23:54,609 --> 00:23:56,565
It looks great. I want one.

331
00:23:58,249 --> 00:24:01,002
I'm gonna be in
Advertising Age Magazine.

332
00:24:01,209 --> 00:24:03,643
A horrible title.
They're staring.

333
00:24:03,849 --> 00:24:06,602
- I heard a laugh.
- Changing subject:

334
00:24:06,809 --> 00:24:09,881
- Colonial Airlines is up for grabs.
- I know.

335
00:24:10,089 --> 00:24:14,082
Three agencies will do presentations.
We need to be there.

336
00:24:14,409 --> 00:24:18,527
I've set up a dinner for you
and the owner, Andrew Woolridge.

337
00:24:18,729 --> 00:24:21,527
He's a former Navy pilot.

338
00:24:21,729 --> 00:24:24,562
He's private, cautious,
a man of few words.

339
00:24:24,769 --> 00:24:28,159
Or he's dumb, paranoid
and totally off his rocker.

340
00:24:28,369 --> 00:24:30,246
Nobody knows for sure.

341
00:24:30,449 --> 00:24:32,599
- You're staring again.
- What? No.

342
00:24:32,809 --> 00:24:34,527
- Yes, you are.
- No.

343
00:24:35,289 --> 00:24:38,964
It's time for the real test.
Let's go. Follow me.

344
00:24:39,169 --> 00:24:42,366
Looks good from the back.
Real test of what?

345
00:24:42,969 --> 00:24:46,598
- How it looks underwater.
- It'll look fabulous.

346
00:24:46,929 --> 00:24:48,157
Hold this, please.

347
00:24:53,289 --> 00:24:54,608
How's it look?

348
00:24:54,849 --> 00:24:56,168
It's over there.

349
00:24:57,849 --> 00:24:59,726
Oh, shit, it's sinking.

350
00:25:21,929 --> 00:25:23,601
Room 432, please.

351
00:25:26,089 --> 00:25:28,045
I'll try back, thanks.

352
00:25:32,289 --> 00:25:35,122
Excuse me, do you happen
to have the time?

353
00:25:35,329 --> 00:25:37,206
Yes, it is...

354
00:25:37,409 --> 00:25:39,798
...let's see, 7:30.

355
00:25:40,009 --> 00:25:44,480
We better hurry or the Renaissance
will arrive and we'll be painting.

356
00:25:44,689 --> 00:25:46,805
What are you talking about?

357
00:25:47,329 --> 00:25:49,240
It's a line from a movie.

358
00:25:49,449 --> 00:25:53,237
Didn't work. A Woody Allen movie.
Does that carry weight?

359
00:25:53,449 --> 00:25:55,041
No, it doesn't.

360
00:25:55,729 --> 00:25:57,560
But it wasn't a disaster.

361
00:25:59,369 --> 00:26:01,599
Why don't we try some honesty?

362
00:26:01,809 --> 00:26:05,518
I've the most important
business dinner of my career tonight.

363
00:26:05,729 --> 00:26:06,923
What career is it?

364
00:26:07,129 --> 00:26:12,078
Advertising. After seeing you, it
doesn't seem that important anymore.

365
00:26:12,609 --> 00:26:17,637
- My name is Basner, David Basner.
- David Basner, I'm Cheryl Ann Wayne.

366
00:26:20,289 --> 00:26:23,201
I don't know how long
my dinner will take...

367
00:26:23,409 --> 00:26:26,003
...but could we have a drink later?

368
00:26:26,689 --> 00:26:28,407
No, we can't.

369
00:26:31,769 --> 00:26:36,081
Is my nose bleeding?
I just got tagged. Ouch.

370
00:26:37,369 --> 00:26:42,079
- You know the Heimlich maneuver?
- Why, certainly, sir.

371
00:26:42,289 --> 00:26:43,722
I'll have the trout.

372
00:26:43,929 --> 00:26:47,319
- I'm here to see Andrew Woolridge.
- This way, please.

373
00:26:49,969 --> 00:26:51,243
Mr. Woolridge?

374
00:26:51,849 --> 00:26:53,077
David Basner.

375
00:26:53,289 --> 00:26:58,568
I appreciate you seeing me for dinner.
They serve a notorious lobster bisque.

376
00:26:58,769 --> 00:26:59,997
No dinner.

377
00:27:01,809 --> 00:27:03,845
I'm sorry. No dinner?

378
00:27:04,049 --> 00:27:08,565
Did I stutter? I said no dinner.
I eat alone. We're having drinks.

379
00:27:09,209 --> 00:27:10,642
I see.

380
00:27:11,849 --> 00:27:14,488
I'll have a white wine spritzer,
please.

381
00:27:14,689 --> 00:27:18,318
- I said we're having drinks.
- Stoli on the rocks.

382
00:27:20,209 --> 00:27:22,086
I'll get to the point.

383
00:27:22,769 --> 00:27:26,159
It's great that you're considering
a Chicago agency.

384
00:27:26,369 --> 00:27:29,167
New York is New York.
L.A., who knows.

385
00:27:29,369 --> 00:27:31,166
Chicago is the U.S. Of A.

386
00:27:31,369 --> 00:27:35,123
Boile, Gargas and Lionel
can't wait to do a presentation.

387
00:27:35,329 --> 00:27:39,004
So much so, we're willing
to do it on spec.

388
00:27:39,209 --> 00:27:44,124
Sometimes I eat my whole meal
just using my salad fork.

389
00:27:44,769 --> 00:27:45,758
Really?

390
00:27:45,969 --> 00:27:48,085
I'm sorry I'm gonna miss that.

391
00:27:49,849 --> 00:27:50,804
Anyway...

392
00:27:51,049 --> 00:27:53,165
Sorry, I had to make some calls.

393
00:27:53,769 --> 00:27:57,398
Cheryl Ann Wayne,
media director of Colonial Airlines.

394
00:27:57,889 --> 00:28:02,041
- I was with Capital Air...
- You already have the job.

395
00:28:02,249 --> 00:28:04,001
I want to hear about him.

396
00:28:04,209 --> 00:28:07,360
They're one of three top agencies
in the Midwest.

397
00:28:07,609 --> 00:28:09,918
They are strong with TV spots.

398
00:28:10,129 --> 00:28:14,407
Basner's the new Creative Director.
He's good, but a bit impulsive.

399
00:28:14,649 --> 00:28:17,402
He gives up everything
for a pretty face.

400
00:28:17,969 --> 00:28:20,164
And I wear bikini briefs.

401
00:28:21,769 --> 00:28:25,045
- It's for you, Ms. Wayne.
- Thank you. Excuse me.

402
00:28:25,849 --> 00:28:26,964
Hello?

403
00:28:27,809 --> 00:28:29,003
Yes, Bill.

404
00:28:29,969 --> 00:28:32,722
That won't do.
I need the report tomorrow.

405
00:28:33,409 --> 00:28:34,842
Yes, I'm holding.

406
00:28:37,009 --> 00:28:41,560
I was meaning to ask you,
by eating with the salad fork...

407
00:28:41,769 --> 00:28:44,158
...does that include the soup?

408
00:29:02,169 --> 00:29:06,208
- You don't stay in the same hotel?
- Never where the boss stays.

409
00:29:06,409 --> 00:29:07,922
I like my privacy.

410
00:29:08,129 --> 00:29:11,678
I don't usually mix business
with pleasure...

411
00:29:11,889 --> 00:29:14,403
...but I didn't get to eat.

412
00:29:14,649 --> 00:29:16,401
This is nice.

413
00:29:17,049 --> 00:29:19,847
Basner, let's talk.

414
00:29:20,209 --> 00:29:23,838
It's difficult for a woman
in the corporate world.

415
00:29:24,049 --> 00:29:28,440
We're labeled as having slept
our way to the top. I don't have to.

416
00:29:28,689 --> 00:29:33,479
I have an MBA from the Wharton School
of Business and other credentials.

417
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:37,728
We'll be fine if you stay
on your side of the line.

418
00:29:37,929 --> 00:29:43,049
If you cross it, I'm fully capable
of kicking you in the balls.

419
00:29:47,329 --> 00:29:49,524
I went to the Wharton School.

420
00:29:49,729 --> 00:29:52,846
- That's a lie.
- Yes, I'm lying, I'm sorry.

421
00:29:53,049 --> 00:29:56,598
I'm protecting my balls,
just as at one time or another...

422
00:29:56,809 --> 00:29:59,243
...you have protected your own.

423
00:30:00,929 --> 00:30:04,126
Are you suggesting
that I come on too strong?

424
00:30:04,329 --> 00:30:08,208
- Not for a sumo wrestler.
- Your car, ma'am.

425
00:30:14,649 --> 00:30:16,844
- Get in.
- I beg your pardon?

426
00:30:17,089 --> 00:30:20,968
Leave your car and get in.
I'll take you home.

427
00:30:27,009 --> 00:30:30,240
- Where do you live?
- South Dearborn.

428
00:30:30,449 --> 00:30:32,838
Good. I like new places.

429
00:30:41,129 --> 00:30:45,919
Well, I sure am enjoying working
with Colonial Airlines so far.

430
00:30:46,729 --> 00:30:48,082
Yeah?

431
00:30:48,289 --> 00:30:51,884
I'm enjoying you. Definitely.

432
00:30:52,529 --> 00:30:55,999
You have no presentation,
much less an account.

433
00:30:56,209 --> 00:30:59,440
These are details I will handle.

434
00:31:01,369 --> 00:31:03,360
You're cocky.

435
00:31:03,569 --> 00:31:05,605
My father likes that.

436
00:31:06,249 --> 00:31:08,001
Well...

437
00:31:08,849 --> 00:31:12,046
...l'll have to meet him.
What does he do?

438
00:31:12,729 --> 00:31:16,039
He has a nice job
with Colonial Airlines.

439
00:31:16,809 --> 00:31:18,322
Yeah. He owns it.

440
00:31:21,969 --> 00:31:25,041
- Your father's Andrew Woolridge?
- That's right.

441
00:31:26,609 --> 00:31:29,043
You're Andrew Woolridge's daughter?

442
00:31:29,249 --> 00:31:32,605
I'm in bed with a client's...
Your name is Wayne...

443
00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:35,960
...so I was in bed with
his married daughter.

444
00:31:36,169 --> 00:31:39,127
Oh, way to go, Basner.

445
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:41,088
Are you a minor too?

446
00:31:41,289 --> 00:31:44,281
I'll just turn myself in
to the police now.

447
00:31:44,529 --> 00:31:48,317
- Does your husband own anything?
- There's no husband.

448
00:31:49,049 --> 00:31:51,119
Wayne is my mother's name.

449
00:31:51,329 --> 00:31:54,241
I don't want
to trade on nepotism.

450
00:31:54,649 --> 00:31:59,404
- You're still Woolridge's baby girl.
- Basner, I'm a big girl.

451
00:31:59,649 --> 00:32:02,607
I chose to come here.
Now I choose to go.

452
00:32:02,809 --> 00:32:05,039
You can handle it any way you want.

453
00:32:07,769 --> 00:32:10,078
Well, you don't have to leave.

454
00:32:10,409 --> 00:32:13,162
Why are you leaving? Wait a minute!

455
00:32:13,369 --> 00:32:16,327
I thought we'd spend
some time together!

456
00:32:16,569 --> 00:32:19,322
The before was awfully quick.

457
00:32:19,569 --> 00:32:22,367
The middle was nice.
Very... Really nice.

458
00:32:22,609 --> 00:32:25,521
But I was hoping we could prolong...

459
00:32:25,729 --> 00:32:29,608
...the after for a while.
Spend some time together.

460
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:34,561
I think we've spent
enough time together.

461
00:32:34,769 --> 00:32:36,043
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

462
00:32:36,249 --> 00:32:38,638
All I know is you look great
in black...

463
00:32:38,849 --> 00:32:40,726
...and that you're very...
- I work.

464
00:32:40,929 --> 00:32:43,807
- Busy.
- I have to prepare for meetings.

465
00:32:44,009 --> 00:32:47,160
It was nice. Let's not
make an opera out of it.

466
00:32:47,369 --> 00:32:48,882
Gray or red door?

467
00:32:49,089 --> 00:32:52,240
The gray.
Oh, red if you're going.

468
00:32:52,449 --> 00:32:57,079
I wanted to keep you here.
So unlike a one-nighter then, huh?

469
00:32:57,289 --> 00:33:00,440
I'm sure you've done this
plenty of times.

470
00:33:00,889 --> 00:33:03,005
It has to be a one-nighter.

471
00:33:03,209 --> 00:33:06,918
You're uncomfortable
being with the boss' daughter.

472
00:33:13,369 --> 00:33:16,679
Seduced and abandoned...

473
00:33:19,049 --> 00:33:21,438
- Hello?
- Hi. Andrew Woolridge.

474
00:33:21,689 --> 00:33:24,328
- I want to meet tomorrow.
- What?

475
00:33:24,529 --> 00:33:27,839
- Bad connection, could you speak up?
- Sure.

476
00:33:28,049 --> 00:33:30,882
Woolridge here. I'd like you
to meet me...

477
00:33:31,089 --> 00:33:34,559
Please speak into the phone.
I can't hear you.

478
00:33:34,769 --> 00:33:38,398
I'm speaking into the damn phone.
This is Andrew...

479
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:40,640
Stop shouting. It's not me.

480
00:33:40,849 --> 00:33:44,683
You got my machine.
Shouting won't do any good.

481
00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:48,643
So wait for the beep,
and thanks for calling.

482
00:33:48,849 --> 00:33:51,363
You have a strange sense of humor.

483
00:33:51,609 --> 00:33:54,282
I like golf.
We're going to play...

484
00:33:54,529 --> 00:33:57,839
...at the Wackcucut Country Club.
Be there!

485
00:34:01,769 --> 00:34:04,761
To be honest, this is my first time.

486
00:34:04,969 --> 00:34:07,927
I'm out here because
I want to work for you.

487
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:11,678
A lot of people'd say
that honesty is admirable...

488
00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:13,163
...but I won't.

489
00:34:17,529 --> 00:34:19,679
That's it. That's it. Yes!

490
00:34:19,889 --> 00:34:23,564
Yes, Mr. Woolridge,
you were born to golf.

491
00:34:39,249 --> 00:34:42,082
No, Mr. Basner. It's the size four.

492
00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:44,127
Max. The name is Max.

493
00:34:44,329 --> 00:34:47,639
If you don't buy anything,
it's Mr. Basner.

494
00:34:48,089 --> 00:34:50,159
- Four.
- The blue and white...

495
00:34:50,369 --> 00:34:54,362
...with the little sailboat on it.
You all right, Max?

496
00:34:58,649 --> 00:35:02,278
What kid wouldn't wear that,
that lives in Chicago?

497
00:35:02,529 --> 00:35:05,601
Rough and Tough did that
six months ago.

498
00:35:05,809 --> 00:35:09,165
They don't have the colors.
I have the colors.

499
00:35:10,569 --> 00:35:12,958
Thanks, Lenna. I understand.

500
00:35:13,169 --> 00:35:17,640
Maybe you'll like the summer line.
Thanks again, Lenna.

501
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:19,999
Thanks for nothing.

502
00:35:53,089 --> 00:35:55,808
Oh, shit. Oh, shit!

503
00:35:56,009 --> 00:35:58,159
Hey, mister. You all right?

504
00:36:09,129 --> 00:36:10,767
So how did it happen?

505
00:36:10,969 --> 00:36:12,925
You don't need to know how.

506
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:17,008
I'm the father you kept
waiting for two hours.

507
00:36:19,129 --> 00:36:22,405
Let's go home.
Maybe your mother's back by now.

508
00:36:22,649 --> 00:36:24,605
I wouldn't know about that.

509
00:36:24,809 --> 00:36:26,879
What are you talking about?

510
00:36:27,089 --> 00:36:29,205
- Well...
- What are you saying?!

511
00:36:29,409 --> 00:36:32,367
- She didn't say anything...
- What did she say?

512
00:36:35,289 --> 00:36:37,359
She found your cufflinks...

513
00:36:37,609 --> 00:36:40,521
...and she asked me to return them.

514
00:36:43,649 --> 00:36:46,083
So she's not coming back.

515
00:36:46,289 --> 00:36:48,644
Who the hell needs her?

516
00:36:53,689 --> 00:36:55,884
Come on, get in the car!

517
00:37:03,529 --> 00:37:07,841
Attention, members. The karate
and tai chi class schedules...

518
00:37:08,049 --> 00:37:10,404
...are now posted on the board.

519
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:14,722
David, guess what. I got a job.

520
00:37:14,929 --> 00:37:19,639
- You never had one. What can you do?
- I'm answering phones.

521
00:37:19,849 --> 00:37:23,762
And I'm brushing up
on my office skills and...

522
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:27,965
It's wonderful.
People talk to me and I get paid.

523
00:37:28,169 --> 00:37:32,447
- Want to get in a typing class?
- Jane is helping me brush up.

524
00:37:32,689 --> 00:37:36,967
It's wonderful to have a son
whose secretary cares about you.

525
00:37:39,289 --> 00:37:42,406
Isn't it time for that
yoga class I paid for?

526
00:37:43,369 --> 00:37:45,758
- David.
- Charlie. Hi.

527
00:37:48,169 --> 00:37:50,763
- Does it work in the pool?
- Gave up swimming.

528
00:37:52,089 --> 00:37:54,762
I hear we may have a shot.
Say yes.

529
00:37:54,969 --> 00:37:58,757
Yes. Reading about horse racing,
Tesio and ducks.

530
00:37:58,969 --> 00:38:03,121
Widgeons, canvasbacks,
Donalds, Daffys, all ducks.

531
00:38:03,329 --> 00:38:07,004
Don't get carried away
with Donalds and Daffys.

532
00:38:07,209 --> 00:38:11,168
- Be calm. It's an important account.
- What account?

533
00:38:11,369 --> 00:38:14,088
I'm sorry. Lorraine,
my mother, who works.

534
00:38:14,289 --> 00:38:16,245
Charlie Gargas, whom I work for.

535
00:38:16,409 --> 00:38:20,004
How do you do? This is
your sister, not your mother.

536
00:38:20,209 --> 00:38:24,282
- He's in advertising, watch out.
- Delighted. Excuse me.

537
00:38:24,529 --> 00:38:27,282
Listen carefully, now.
Three things:

538
00:38:27,529 --> 00:38:29,645
Use your humor...

539
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:32,807
...speak specifically about
the agency...

540
00:38:33,009 --> 00:38:35,523
...and what it stands for.

541
00:38:35,729 --> 00:38:38,687
People. Products. Profit.

542
00:38:38,889 --> 00:38:43,121
- Make sure to get an appointment.
- That's why I'm going.

543
00:38:45,129 --> 00:38:48,041
- Is there a problem?
- No. No problem.

544
00:38:48,249 --> 00:38:49,728
- I felt staring.
- No.

545
00:38:49,929 --> 00:38:52,682
I'm between tai chi classes.
Excuse me.

546
00:38:56,569 --> 00:38:59,641
That rug is the worst.
Does he realize it?

547
00:38:59,849 --> 00:39:02,522
He does now.
Have a nice yoga class.

548
00:39:02,729 --> 00:39:05,926
- Charlie!
- Enjoy your weekend, David.

549
00:39:06,889 --> 00:39:10,768
My mom was saying how young you look.
Thirty-five, she said.

550
00:39:33,449 --> 00:39:35,838
Where the heck are the ducks?

551
00:39:52,689 --> 00:39:54,919
This is how you blow it.

552
00:40:01,209 --> 00:40:02,847
Here they come! Up!

553
00:40:17,649 --> 00:40:20,322
The one thing I've learned
in advertising...

554
00:40:20,569 --> 00:40:23,083
Dad, I'm going for more shells.

555
00:40:25,249 --> 00:40:28,719
- My daughter speaks highly of you.
- She does?

556
00:40:28,929 --> 00:40:30,999
She says you're a great lay.

557
00:40:33,209 --> 00:40:34,801
She said that?

558
00:40:35,009 --> 00:40:37,762
Yeah, my baby tells me everything.

559
00:40:37,969 --> 00:40:41,439
Quite a conversation for
a daughter and father.

560
00:40:41,649 --> 00:40:46,006
She's a very modern woman,
I raised her to be an executive.

561
00:40:46,209 --> 00:40:47,927
I raised her to be a man.

562
00:40:48,129 --> 00:40:51,565
So did my father.
I don't tell him anything.

563
00:40:51,769 --> 00:40:53,964
I don't want to hear your story.

564
00:40:54,169 --> 00:40:57,127
Why don't you shoot some more fish?

565
00:41:01,289 --> 00:41:05,043
- Do you know horses?
- My dad has a passion for them.

566
00:41:05,249 --> 00:41:07,444
- Oh, breeding?
- No, betting.

567
00:41:07,689 --> 00:41:10,601
I brought this down.
It's information...

568
00:41:10,809 --> 00:41:15,360
One of my stallions is servicing
Mr. Egan's best mares.

569
00:41:15,609 --> 00:41:18,407
Why don't you take him
to the barn.

570
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:20,520
I have business to tend to.

571
00:41:20,729 --> 00:41:25,564
We can talk about this after the
horses are done servicing each other.

572
00:41:54,809 --> 00:41:57,118
Are you going to dim the lights?

573
00:42:14,929 --> 00:42:18,160
Afterwards what?
Back to the barn for a cigarette?

574
00:43:12,329 --> 00:43:15,719
What do you mean they're for me?
I don't want them.

575
00:43:15,929 --> 00:43:18,887
I can't carry ducks on the plane.

576
00:43:19,129 --> 00:43:22,724
Here's something to make
your city friends envious.

577
00:43:22,929 --> 00:43:25,124
- Oh, thank you.
- Enjoy those.

578
00:43:25,329 --> 00:43:26,728
Great. You know...

579
00:43:26,929 --> 00:43:31,400
...your farm's beautiful.
I particularly loved the horses.

580
00:43:31,649 --> 00:43:33,879
I read a stallion's responsible...

581
00:43:34,089 --> 00:43:36,842
...for 60% of the offspring's traits.

582
00:43:37,049 --> 00:43:39,040
But mares are responsible for 40%...

583
00:43:39,249 --> 00:43:42,366
...of the get's traits.
According to Tesio.

584
00:43:42,609 --> 00:43:44,964
- He's the expert.
- You read Tesio?

585
00:43:45,169 --> 00:43:47,399
As a hobby. Sometimes.

586
00:43:47,649 --> 00:43:51,927
Tell your boss Colonial Airlines
will look at your presentation.

587
00:44:00,529 --> 00:44:02,247
Memo to David Basner:

588
00:44:02,449 --> 00:44:05,759
A date's set to
present to Colonial Airlines.

589
00:44:06,249 --> 00:44:09,719
Your staff has two weeks to
come up with greatness.

590
00:44:09,929 --> 00:44:11,726
I want that account.

591
00:44:11,929 --> 00:44:14,727
Signed: John, Paul,
George and Ringo.

592
00:44:15,409 --> 00:44:17,365
Okay, okay. Possibility!

593
00:44:17,609 --> 00:44:18,519
Mishi?

594
00:44:18,729 --> 00:44:21,846
How about this?
You've got Colonial, right?

595
00:44:22,049 --> 00:44:24,802
"Co" stands for cooperation.

596
00:44:25,009 --> 00:44:27,887
"Lo" means never lonely on a plane.

597
00:44:28,089 --> 00:44:30,080
"Ni," plenty of knee room.

598
00:44:30,289 --> 00:44:33,679
And "ial," you'll have
a good time. Colonial.

599
00:44:33,889 --> 00:44:36,323
- No, no, no.
- Give it a chance.

600
00:44:40,089 --> 00:44:42,557
How about this? Colonial Air...

601
00:44:42,769 --> 00:44:46,398
...you don't have to worry
about getting hijacked.

602
00:44:50,289 --> 00:44:53,520
- Colonial moves people.
- The family!

603
00:44:53,729 --> 00:44:55,560
The family thing's the idea.

604
00:44:55,769 --> 00:44:58,681
I understand that.
It's a good concept.

605
00:44:58,889 --> 00:45:01,403
This is funny.
You won't laugh now...

606
00:45:01,609 --> 00:45:04,203
...but you'll crack up driving home.

607
00:45:04,409 --> 00:45:06,684
They're flying all over
the country.

608
00:45:09,609 --> 00:45:11,964
Tell how your life was shattered...

609
00:45:12,169 --> 00:45:14,205
...when you turned from us...

610
00:45:14,409 --> 00:45:19,199
...and put faith in others?
- I was lost, I had no leg room.

611
00:45:19,529 --> 00:45:21,201
Couldn't even smoke.

612
00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:26,558
So board me, and feel the experience.

613
00:45:26,769 --> 00:45:29,124
Fly Colonial Airlines.

614
00:45:31,009 --> 00:45:33,045
- You're an airplane?
- Yeah.

615
00:45:33,249 --> 00:45:34,728
Want to board Mishi?

616
00:45:34,929 --> 00:45:36,920
- No.
- We need a grandma.

617
00:45:37,289 --> 00:45:39,405
I like the grandma idea.

618
00:45:39,889 --> 00:45:42,244
One, two, three, four.

619
00:45:44,689 --> 00:45:47,123
When you're on a plane
In a comfy seat

620
00:45:47,329 --> 00:45:49,718
And next to you
Is an Arab Sheik

621
00:45:49,929 --> 00:45:52,397
Flying to the sky
Really getting high

622
00:45:52,649 --> 00:45:56,005
You're flying on Colonial
And that's no jive

623
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:02,126
- Can we go to the office?
- No. It's a dry spot.

624
00:46:02,329 --> 00:46:04,684
This is my cubicle.
It's magic.

625
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:07,365
Let's hear the art director.

626
00:46:10,329 --> 00:46:12,126
Colonial Airlines

627
00:46:12,329 --> 00:46:14,081
Colonial

628
00:46:19,049 --> 00:46:21,563
Airlines

629
00:46:21,769 --> 00:46:23,361
I like it. It's bluesy.

630
00:46:23,609 --> 00:46:26,362
You know what it is? Lousy.

631
00:46:26,609 --> 00:46:30,887
But if we use some ideas
and real people, not slides...

632
00:46:31,089 --> 00:46:33,080
- Real people.
- He's asking...

633
00:46:33,289 --> 00:46:37,077
...lots of agencies.
They'll show him the same thing.

634
00:46:37,289 --> 00:46:39,598
- He's sick of it.
- We have people.

635
00:46:39,809 --> 00:46:41,720
Anti-high tech, I love it!

636
00:46:41,929 --> 00:46:44,602
Live people. Live presentation.

637
00:46:44,809 --> 00:46:49,280
No gimmicks, no lasers, none of that.
Anti-high tech.

638
00:46:51,729 --> 00:46:54,562
Hugs the grandchildren. Hugs the...

639
00:46:54,769 --> 00:46:57,442
Special. Special kids.

640
00:46:57,649 --> 00:47:00,402
Yeah, holds them.
Hugs her special kids.

641
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:02,918
Get out of here.
I'm in pre-game.

642
00:47:04,849 --> 00:47:07,409
I just came by to wish you luck.

643
00:47:08,969 --> 00:47:13,918
You're hard to find. I think of you
when I see mounted police.

644
00:47:14,129 --> 00:47:18,042
- Wouldn't be fair to the competition.
- Yeah, I was worried.

645
00:47:18,249 --> 00:47:22,037
So, what happens if I get this
and we work together?

646
00:47:22,249 --> 00:47:25,082
I think it'd be terrific.
We'll handle it.

647
00:47:25,289 --> 00:47:29,328
- The perfect executives?
- We'd make a good team.

648
00:47:29,569 --> 00:47:32,925
You know, I sense that.
But I don't know why.

649
00:47:34,009 --> 00:47:36,648
You see something in me you like.

650
00:47:36,849 --> 00:47:38,282
You see you.

651
00:47:38,809 --> 00:47:40,606
I'll see you inside.

652
00:47:47,209 --> 00:47:48,164
Batman.

653
00:47:55,609 --> 00:47:58,169
We're ready to start, Mr. Woolridge.

654
00:48:08,209 --> 00:48:09,358
We're all set.

655
00:48:19,929 --> 00:48:21,248
Good morning.

656
00:48:21,449 --> 00:48:24,009
Research shows Colonial Airlines...

657
00:48:24,209 --> 00:48:26,848
...has its share of business fliers.

658
00:48:27,049 --> 00:48:31,645
There's room for improvement
with family travelers.

659
00:48:31,849 --> 00:48:36,127
We've come up with a campaign
that targets this market.

660
00:48:36,329 --> 00:48:37,887
Picture this:

661
00:48:39,849 --> 00:48:44,286
A grandmother sits in her house
doing needlepoint.

662
00:48:44,529 --> 00:48:48,920
- Another day, another afghan.
- A cup of tea sits beside her.

663
00:48:49,129 --> 00:48:52,166
- An afghan around her legs.
- That's nice.

664
00:48:52,369 --> 00:48:55,202
- The phone rings.
- Hello?

665
00:48:55,409 --> 00:48:57,206
- Hi, Mom.
- Bad connection.

666
00:48:57,409 --> 00:49:00,321
Grandma!
Tell her I hit my first homer!

667
00:49:00,529 --> 00:49:03,327
- Come for a few weeks.
- That'd be great.

668
00:49:03,569 --> 00:49:06,561
Grandma boards a Colonial airliner.

669
00:49:06,769 --> 00:49:09,237
She is made very comfortable.

670
00:49:09,449 --> 00:49:11,599
- Comfortable, ma'am?
- I'm Hattie.

671
00:49:12,329 --> 00:49:14,684
- They compare needlepoint.
- Look.

672
00:49:14,889 --> 00:49:17,961
- The stewardess tucks her in.
- Thank you.

673
00:49:18,169 --> 00:49:20,683
And brings her a hot cup of tea.

674
00:49:20,889 --> 00:49:23,961
Grandma chats with
the other passengers.

675
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:27,605
- Hi, there.
- In Bombay, I was an internist.

676
00:49:27,809 --> 00:49:30,004
I'm going to a convention.

677
00:49:30,529 --> 00:49:31,598
The plane lands.

678
00:49:31,809 --> 00:49:35,688
We see chauffeurs holding
signs with clients' names.

679
00:49:36,089 --> 00:49:38,125
Is there a T. Jones here?

680
00:49:38,329 --> 00:49:41,048
Looking for Gonzalez.

681
00:49:41,249 --> 00:49:44,127
- What?
- A boy holds a sign that says:

682
00:49:44,329 --> 00:49:46,718
- Grandma!
- Jimmy!

683
00:49:46,929 --> 00:49:48,760
We witness a reunion.

684
00:49:48,969 --> 00:49:51,358
- It's so nice to see you.
- Grandma!

685
00:49:51,609 --> 00:49:55,602
- How you've grown!
- As does the smiling stewardess.

686
00:49:55,809 --> 00:49:59,006
- Bye, Hattie.
- Tell your mom about lemon for colds.

687
00:49:59,209 --> 00:50:00,847
- See you in Toledo.
- Bombay.

688
00:50:01,049 --> 00:50:02,118
- Caracas.
- Where?

689
00:50:02,929 --> 00:50:06,046
Then she sits with the adoring kids.

690
00:50:06,249 --> 00:50:08,240
- Warm enough?
- I love you!

691
00:50:08,449 --> 00:50:10,565
Her daughter brings her tea.

692
00:50:10,769 --> 00:50:12,964
- Here's some tea, Mom.
- Hattie.

693
00:50:13,169 --> 00:50:17,048
Grandma has to
just hug those special kids.

694
00:50:17,249 --> 00:50:19,683
- We're glad you came.
- Thanks, Grandma.

695
00:50:19,889 --> 00:50:25,009
We dissolve to the Colonial plane
flying into a red sunset.

696
00:50:25,849 --> 00:50:27,168
And we hear:

697
00:50:27,369 --> 00:50:29,246
From your home...

698
00:50:29,449 --> 00:50:30,928
...to our home...

699
00:50:31,129 --> 00:50:32,721
...to their home.

700
00:50:34,649 --> 00:50:36,605
Colonial Airlines...

701
00:50:36,809 --> 00:50:38,879
...your home in the skies.

702
00:50:48,409 --> 00:50:50,400
Do you have anything else?

703
00:50:52,209 --> 00:50:54,928
We like this.
It's our strongest concept.

704
00:51:12,889 --> 00:51:14,925
Who got an airline? I did!

705
00:51:15,129 --> 00:51:17,404
- I want to talk to you!
- Wait.

706
00:51:17,649 --> 00:51:19,241
- Who got it?
- Not the grass!

707
00:51:19,769 --> 00:51:21,805
Don't get up.
Standing ovation!

708
00:51:22,009 --> 00:51:26,958
- Everyone knows I got an airline.
- You got it! Congratulations!

709
00:51:27,169 --> 00:51:30,525
- Don't I get a hug?
- That's a friend of mine.

710
00:51:30,729 --> 00:51:33,448
- I deserve congratulations too.
- Why?

711
00:51:33,689 --> 00:51:36,249
Remember that grant I applied for?

712
00:51:36,449 --> 00:51:38,883
They called me today, and I got it!

713
00:51:39,089 --> 00:51:40,761
That's great! How much?

714
00:51:40,969 --> 00:51:44,245
Not a lot.
Enough for the Gemini Theater.

715
00:51:44,449 --> 00:51:46,644
- The garage?
- We'll convert it.

716
00:51:46,849 --> 00:51:49,522
The world needs more
experimental theater.

717
00:51:49,729 --> 00:51:53,927
Let's go out. We'll celebrate
with an expensive, snazzy dinner.

718
00:51:54,289 --> 00:51:56,166
I can't take long.

719
00:51:57,449 --> 00:52:00,919
- You can't park on the lawn!
- We're moving it.

720
00:52:01,129 --> 00:52:04,804
This is a 4-wheel drive.
There was no place to park!

721
00:52:05,009 --> 00:52:07,045
- Who's he?
- Dean of parking.

722
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:10,047
- Who?
- Dean Wood, in the speech department.

723
00:52:10,249 --> 00:52:13,480
Wait. Robert, I'll call you!

724
00:52:13,689 --> 00:52:15,884
- Bye-bye.
- So long, Robin!

725
00:52:17,729 --> 00:52:22,245
Welcome to our 10th Fashion Show
for young lads and little misses.

726
00:52:22,929 --> 00:52:25,841
Hey! The Campbell brothers.

727
00:52:26,089 --> 00:52:27,044
Here.

728
00:52:27,249 --> 00:52:29,604
Have a personal pen
from Max Basner.

729
00:52:31,889 --> 00:52:34,642
When this is over,
come up and we'll talk.

730
00:52:36,849 --> 00:52:40,683
That's Sal Mancuso.
He's one of my biggest customers.

731
00:52:41,129 --> 00:52:44,007
How much business has he given you?

732
00:52:44,609 --> 00:52:46,645
His wife has been sick.

733
00:52:47,529 --> 00:52:50,999
Looks like all your customers
have sick families.

734
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:53,803
Don't worry.
Business will pick up.

735
00:52:54,569 --> 00:52:58,721
A pink dress with a
Pilgrim collar in poly-cotton.

736
00:52:58,929 --> 00:53:00,601
That is super.

737
00:53:01,329 --> 00:53:04,958
Kristen is my choice
for model of the year.

738
00:53:05,249 --> 00:53:09,561
- Well, it's nice to see you, Max.
- Nice to see you, Mr. Keenan.

739
00:53:10,009 --> 00:53:11,727
Turn in your samples.

740
00:53:13,209 --> 00:53:15,359
But that's my spring line.

741
00:53:15,569 --> 00:53:19,198
We have someone else in mind
to take care of that.

742
00:53:19,569 --> 00:53:22,402
We're letting you go.
You're fired.

743
00:53:26,409 --> 00:53:28,718
Item sixteen...

744
00:53:28,929 --> 00:53:32,842
...is Adam, in poly-cotton
gray flannel trousers.

745
00:53:33,049 --> 00:53:36,758
My kid's in the show.
I have to go. I'll see you later.

746
00:53:36,969 --> 00:53:39,722
We thank the kids
who modeled today...

747
00:53:39,929 --> 00:53:43,365
...and all the kids
who were forced to be here.

748
00:53:47,089 --> 00:53:51,685
Goodbye, have a grand year,
and remember our motto:

749
00:53:51,889 --> 00:53:54,244
Be proud to be a salesman.

750
00:55:29,969 --> 00:55:33,325
Ah, don't ad-lib the lines.
Stick to the copy.

751
00:55:33,569 --> 00:55:36,845
Enjoy the language and
read the script.

752
00:55:37,049 --> 00:55:38,607
Relax. Enjoy.

753
00:55:41,609 --> 00:55:43,725
Oh, George.

754
00:55:48,369 --> 00:55:51,725
They think up the commercials
for marketing...

755
00:55:51,929 --> 00:55:54,682
...and send them to
the account executives.

756
00:55:54,889 --> 00:55:58,928
This is called the bullpen.
That's a baseball term.

757
00:55:59,129 --> 00:56:02,644
Please step over here,
and we'll take a break.

758
00:56:03,649 --> 00:56:07,278
I want to hear you say:
"I trust your judgement."

759
00:56:07,529 --> 00:56:11,647
She doesn't look like a grandmother.
She looks like a hooker.

760
00:56:11,849 --> 00:56:14,602
- She's no hooker.
- There are more grandmas.

761
00:56:14,809 --> 00:56:16,447
Tour coming through.

762
00:56:16,689 --> 00:56:20,648
I'm saying grandmothers
are getting younger every day.

763
00:56:20,849 --> 00:56:22,567
You know David Basner?

764
00:56:22,769 --> 00:56:25,727
Number two had
a geriatric youthfulness.

765
00:56:25,929 --> 00:56:29,399
- I need some input.
- Will you come to my office?

766
00:56:29,609 --> 00:56:32,919
Where were you?
I've been waiting for you.

767
00:56:33,129 --> 00:56:35,199
I got cramps from the grapes.

768
00:56:35,409 --> 00:56:37,445
It's noon, Dad. I work here.

769
00:56:37,689 --> 00:56:40,681
- Aren't you gonna introduce me?
- No.

770
00:56:40,889 --> 00:56:44,120
I've been here for five years,
and now you visit.

771
00:56:44,329 --> 00:56:48,686
I had no coffee at home.
I thought maybe you'd have some.

772
00:56:48,889 --> 00:56:52,438
This is something!
Secretaries. Offices.

773
00:56:52,649 --> 00:56:55,527
- It's a regular big deal.
- What do you want?

774
00:56:55,849 --> 00:56:56,964
Not here.

775
00:56:58,009 --> 00:57:01,558
I got a promotion
so I can have an office.

776
00:57:01,769 --> 00:57:04,329
- See my name?
- Not here.

777
00:57:05,289 --> 00:57:09,328
Can't you give me five minutes?
Let's take a drive.

778
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:17,684
- Why don't you get a normal car?
- It's a jeep, Dad. I look good in it.

779
00:57:22,049 --> 00:57:26,804
This goddamn car! You have to
be a mountain climber to get in.

780
00:57:31,609 --> 00:57:34,248
- Want one? They're Honduran.
- No.

781
00:57:34,449 --> 00:57:38,283
- Can't get the Cubans anymore.
- No, thank you.

782
00:57:43,209 --> 00:57:45,439
I lost my lines.

783
00:57:49,609 --> 00:57:51,440
They fired me.

784
00:58:15,729 --> 00:58:17,321
What are you gonna do?

785
00:58:18,129 --> 00:58:21,201
I know you hate me...

786
00:58:21,409 --> 00:58:23,798
...but you have to help me.

787
00:58:34,569 --> 00:58:35,604
No, you don't.

788
00:58:35,809 --> 00:58:38,721
You send her from
the cold to the warm.

789
00:58:38,929 --> 00:58:42,285
That way she doesn't
get pneumonia and die.

790
00:58:49,289 --> 00:58:53,646
- We can have dinner. Macaroni.
- I can't. I've got a date.

791
00:58:53,849 --> 00:58:56,317
I got you X-Rated action
on every page:

792
00:58:56,529 --> 00:58:59,282
Eros, Macho,
Hot and Sexy Mature Women.

793
00:59:01,089 --> 00:59:05,321
You know, that's something
we always had in common.

794
00:59:05,569 --> 00:59:09,528
- Who?
- My father. You. Me.

795
00:59:09,969 --> 00:59:12,529
We could always talk a girl into bed.

796
00:59:12,729 --> 00:59:14,560
Glad you still can, Dad.

797
00:59:14,769 --> 00:59:16,839
- You need asparagus?
- I can't.

798
00:59:19,209 --> 00:59:21,120
I can't do it anymore.

799
00:59:35,369 --> 00:59:37,963
You wanted that clock?
I hope it'll do.

800
00:59:38,169 --> 00:59:40,808
Flashlight.
There was something else.

801
00:59:41,009 --> 00:59:43,682
- Thank you.
- What is that? That's right.

802
00:59:43,889 --> 00:59:47,245
Look at that, Mom.
Look, it's a dog.

803
00:59:48,289 --> 00:59:51,565
- Where did you get him?
- Down at the pound.

804
00:59:51,769 --> 00:59:53,202
Does he have papers?

805
00:59:53,409 --> 00:59:56,526
He gets newspapers.
He's not house-trained.

806
00:59:57,009 --> 01:00:01,685
David, thank you.
Oh, someone to love.

807
01:00:02,729 --> 01:00:04,924
- See you later.
- Bye. Thanks.

808
01:00:05,129 --> 01:00:08,883
Oh, you're so sweet.
Did that scare you?

809
01:00:09,729 --> 01:00:14,439
Who is studying psychology?
Economics? Philosophy? That's good.

810
01:00:14,689 --> 01:00:17,840
Advertising's the
distillation of what we know.

811
01:00:18,449 --> 01:00:22,727
Ask Mr. Buzzword. I love what I do.
I'm not writing novels.

812
01:00:22,929 --> 01:00:26,285
I have no manuscript.
I don't want to direct.

813
01:00:26,529 --> 01:00:30,124
I like advertising.
If you like it, give it a shot.

814
01:00:30,329 --> 01:00:33,924
But if you choke, you could
end up like Mr. Buzzword.

815
01:00:34,129 --> 01:00:37,280
- Isn't that right, Ted?
- Thanks, David.

816
01:00:38,529 --> 01:00:40,884
Mr. Basner loves to kid.

817
01:00:41,289 --> 01:00:44,838
- What's the dilemma?
- What kind of chair do we use?

818
01:00:45,049 --> 01:00:47,165
- What kind are there?
- Excuse me?

819
01:00:47,369 --> 01:00:48,961
- What?
- Dad.

820
01:01:02,849 --> 01:01:03,725
Come on.

821
01:01:04,769 --> 01:01:07,363
Put it back.
Put it back!

822
01:01:08,329 --> 01:01:11,287
Shame on you.
I'm sorry.

823
01:01:11,849 --> 01:01:13,328
Get in the car.

824
01:01:13,849 --> 01:01:17,239
- Cubitode is a bookie.
- You don't know him.

825
01:01:17,449 --> 01:01:21,965
- He's talking about kneecaps.
- They don't break kneecaps for $ 75.

826
01:01:22,169 --> 01:01:27,004
You bought your mother a car!
Aren't my knees worth $75?!

827
01:01:27,209 --> 01:01:29,803
Didn't we do that yesterday?

828
01:01:30,529 --> 01:01:32,679
- What?
- I need a cleaning lady.

829
01:01:32,889 --> 01:01:34,720
You missed my birthday.

830
01:01:34,929 --> 01:01:37,284
They have buses out to the track.

831
01:01:37,529 --> 01:01:39,042
I've got a problem.

832
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:43,204
- The dog wants to say hi.
- I know it's 2 am.

833
01:01:43,409 --> 01:01:47,038
Mom, the AA helps alcoholics.
You need AAA.

834
01:01:47,449 --> 01:01:49,565
I'm sorry I bothered you.

835
01:01:49,769 --> 01:01:52,567
I'm the father he's ashamed of.

836
01:01:52,769 --> 01:01:56,842
- Father's on 7, mother's on 8.
- I was in a meeting!

837
01:01:57,049 --> 01:01:58,926
Don't put me on hold.

838
01:01:59,129 --> 01:02:01,962
I knew him before he had conferences!

839
01:02:02,169 --> 01:02:04,319
- Your mother again.
- That's it.

840
01:02:04,569 --> 01:02:05,888
- I can't.
- Dad on 4.

841
01:02:06,089 --> 01:02:08,922
- I'm your mother.
- I'll go as soon as I can!

842
01:02:09,129 --> 01:02:11,597
You just called an hour ago!

843
01:02:23,249 --> 01:02:25,922
- Who is it?
- David, come on, open up.

844
01:02:26,129 --> 01:02:28,359
- They're driving me crazy.
- Who?

845
01:02:28,569 --> 01:02:30,127
My folks. Can I come in?

846
01:02:30,329 --> 01:02:32,604
- It's midnight.
- Please. I know.

847
01:02:32,809 --> 01:02:34,367
They're driving me crazy!

848
01:02:38,129 --> 01:02:41,201
- This better be...
- Everything is coming true.

849
01:02:41,409 --> 01:02:44,879
- Have we been drinking?
- Just a little, not too much.

850
01:02:45,089 --> 01:02:48,240
It's "get my dry cleaning,
help with groceries...

851
01:02:48,449 --> 01:02:52,886
...I can't drive, take me here, David.
David, David, David."

852
01:02:53,089 --> 01:02:55,205
It's affecting my work, Donna.

853
01:02:55,409 --> 01:02:58,048
I feel like a Swedish au pair boy.

854
01:02:58,249 --> 01:02:59,284
I got Mom a dog.

855
01:02:59,529 --> 01:03:02,919
- Donna? Sweetheart?
- Just a minute.

856
01:03:04,169 --> 01:03:07,161
David, I'm not alone.

857
01:03:08,969 --> 01:03:10,561
Sit here and stay calm.

858
01:03:10,769 --> 01:03:12,407
Stay.

859
01:03:13,889 --> 01:03:15,322
Stay!

860
01:03:20,329 --> 01:03:24,083
What's happening?
I heard drumming.

861
01:03:24,289 --> 01:03:27,281
- An old friend is having a problem.
- Now?

862
01:03:27,529 --> 01:03:31,044
- His parents have split up.
- Well, how old is he?

863
01:03:32,409 --> 01:03:33,728
He needs to talk.

864
01:03:34,129 --> 01:03:37,041
I apologize for barging in like this.

865
01:03:37,249 --> 01:03:39,558
I'm sorry. I won't be long.

866
01:03:39,769 --> 01:03:43,205
- He's drunk.
- I just had a couple scotches.

867
01:03:43,409 --> 01:03:45,684
I know you! We met!

868
01:03:45,889 --> 01:03:48,084
You're in Psychology.
Roland...

869
01:03:48,289 --> 01:03:51,964
- Robert!
- Robert, you're naked.

870
01:03:52,169 --> 01:03:54,364
I came at a real bad time!

871
01:03:54,609 --> 01:03:57,169
- You know what she likes?
- David!

872
01:03:57,369 --> 01:04:00,202
- I'll kill you!
- I'm talking with Robert!

873
01:04:01,409 --> 01:04:06,085
We were like this in high school.
Sometimes like this.

874
01:04:06,289 --> 01:04:08,644
We used to go steady. I like her.

875
01:04:08,849 --> 01:04:12,319
She's got a lot of energy.
Her middle name is Mildred.

876
01:04:12,969 --> 01:04:16,644
- Donna Mildred Martin!
- David, I will use this weapon!

877
01:04:16,849 --> 01:04:21,240
I'm talking about the nervous
breakdown caused by my parents!

878
01:04:21,449 --> 01:04:25,920
- Remember my angry voice?
- I'm an only child. Their breakup...

879
01:04:26,129 --> 01:04:29,565
- Get out! Get out!
- I mean, they don't...

880
01:04:29,769 --> 01:04:31,168
Wait, don't get up!

881
01:04:31,369 --> 01:04:35,760
- She'll put you back in the mood.
- That is not fair!

882
01:04:36,009 --> 01:04:38,603
Your friend has unresolved conflicts.

883
01:04:38,809 --> 01:04:43,087
Don't give me that psychoanalytic
bullshit, please.

884
01:04:43,289 --> 01:04:47,441
My life's endeavors are bullshit?
Glad this came up. I should go.

885
01:04:47,689 --> 01:04:51,045
No, don't go, please. I'm sorry.

886
01:04:55,009 --> 01:04:57,318
Just give me a minute with him.

887
01:05:01,249 --> 01:05:03,763
Just a minute, promise.

888
01:05:07,569 --> 01:05:08,968
I don't believe it.

889
01:05:10,929 --> 01:05:14,808
You've still got it.
Where are these kids, huh?

890
01:05:15,009 --> 01:05:19,287
David Basner, the swim team,
junior class treasurer...

891
01:05:19,529 --> 01:05:23,158
...and Donna Martin, drama club.
Emily, Our Town.

892
01:05:23,369 --> 01:05:25,439
Maria, West Side Story.

893
01:05:25,689 --> 01:05:28,681
Golden high school moments.
Fabulous.

894
01:05:28,889 --> 01:05:31,278
I'd like to talk about tonight.

895
01:05:31,529 --> 01:05:35,044
- Did you hear me?
- I can't think of you with another.

896
01:05:35,289 --> 01:05:37,644
You never ask.

897
01:05:37,849 --> 01:05:41,080
I'm sorry, but we can't
do this anymore.

898
01:05:41,289 --> 01:05:44,122
Who am I gonna talk to? You're my pal.

899
01:05:44,329 --> 01:05:46,399
I don't want to be that.

900
01:05:46,649 --> 01:05:49,880
I want to move on.
I want a relationship.

901
01:05:50,089 --> 01:05:53,161
- Robert?
- With Robert, or someone else...

902
01:05:53,369 --> 01:05:55,041
You change your hair?

903
01:05:55,249 --> 01:05:57,240
- Something is different.
- No.

904
01:05:57,449 --> 01:05:59,326
Is the bathrobe new?

905
01:05:59,569 --> 01:06:02,720
- It's old. You've seen it before.
- No, I haven't.

906
01:06:02,929 --> 01:06:05,887
- You wore it!
- I wore the pink one.

907
01:06:06,089 --> 01:06:07,363
This is pink.

908
01:06:10,689 --> 01:06:12,486
You looked great in it.

909
01:06:12,689 --> 01:06:14,600
Well, let me try it on.

910
01:06:16,009 --> 01:06:18,569
- I want to see if it fits.
- Listen!

911
01:06:18,769 --> 01:06:23,320
I won't be your emotional
pit stop anymore.

912
01:06:23,569 --> 01:06:26,845
An emotional pit stop,
you won't be that anymore.

913
01:06:27,049 --> 01:06:30,883
An "emotional pit stop."
That's beautiful!

914
01:06:31,089 --> 01:06:34,399
Did Robert tell you
this kind of term?

915
01:06:34,609 --> 01:06:39,922
Like check under the hood, and
examine my heart and mental attitude?

916
01:06:40,129 --> 01:06:43,724
And how I'm doing?
How secure I feel, and all that?

917
01:06:43,929 --> 01:06:47,365
It's lovely.
That's psychology, isn't it?

918
01:06:47,569 --> 01:06:50,083
"Psychoanalytical bullshit"...

919
01:06:50,289 --> 01:06:55,317
...I think you described it.

920
01:06:55,689 --> 01:06:59,523
I'll remember that.
Does Robert wear the robe?

921
01:07:01,449 --> 01:07:03,963
Go home, David.

922
01:09:34,609 --> 01:09:37,362
I just can't drive.
I can get around okay.

923
01:09:37,609 --> 01:09:41,602
- You read the racing form like this.
- I like the charts.

924
01:09:41,809 --> 01:09:44,721
It's giving you ink stains
on your eyeballs.

925
01:09:44,929 --> 01:09:48,285
- So let's go.
- All right.

926
01:09:48,529 --> 01:09:51,327
I'll go up,
but I'm going up alone.

927
01:09:51,569 --> 01:09:54,845
Now, you're in a loading zone.
Get going.

928
01:09:55,049 --> 01:09:57,768
You were to see a doctor,
and you didn't.

929
01:09:57,969 --> 01:10:00,119
I want to make sure.

930
01:10:00,329 --> 01:10:02,843
Don't, David. Don't embarrass me.

931
01:10:03,049 --> 01:10:07,520
They'll think I can't
take care of myself.

932
01:10:07,729 --> 01:10:10,721
- I wanna know what the doctor says.
- Certainly.

933
01:10:11,089 --> 01:10:12,602
Call me.

934
01:10:12,809 --> 01:10:14,640
- All right.
- Call me.

935
01:10:21,289 --> 01:10:24,201
Wait a minute!
I had this thing timed.

936
01:10:24,409 --> 01:10:27,958
The bridge is up,
I couldn't go. Whoa, wait!

937
01:10:28,169 --> 01:10:29,841
Give me the ticket.

938
01:10:30,049 --> 01:10:33,166
I bet you're upset
you didn't get to tow it.

939
01:10:33,369 --> 01:10:35,837
That would have made your day.

940
01:10:49,929 --> 01:10:52,523
I'd rather sleep in my own bed.

941
01:10:52,729 --> 01:10:55,880
I don't have a change of clothes.

942
01:10:56,089 --> 01:10:58,398
Are you worried about tomorrow?

943
01:10:58,649 --> 01:11:03,279
We've shot a lot of commercials.
We could do it blindfolded.

944
01:11:03,769 --> 01:11:05,885
As a matter of fact...

945
01:11:06,089 --> 01:11:10,207
...why don't we actually
shoot this commercial...

946
01:11:10,409 --> 01:11:13,048
...with the director blindfolded?

947
01:11:14,849 --> 01:11:18,603
This is a joke.
This is a joke, Cheryl Ann.

948
01:11:18,809 --> 01:11:21,118
I'm making a joke.

949
01:11:21,329 --> 01:11:22,603
You're cute.

950
01:11:25,129 --> 01:11:27,199
Get some sleep.

951
01:11:38,449 --> 01:11:39,962
Hello?

952
01:11:40,169 --> 01:11:42,399
Hi, Jo-Jo. What's going on?

953
01:12:00,129 --> 01:12:03,201
Three beers and 10 air balls.

954
01:12:04,209 --> 01:12:05,688
Thanks for calling.

955
01:12:08,289 --> 01:12:12,328
- You've got very nice moves.
- Thank you.

956
01:12:12,529 --> 01:12:14,520
I played for St. Mary's.

957
01:12:15,129 --> 01:12:16,403
Shoot!

958
01:12:18,329 --> 01:12:19,887
I missed.

959
01:12:22,289 --> 01:12:24,803
- What's the score?
- You're up by two.

960
01:12:25,249 --> 01:12:27,604
- Hi, David.
- Hi, Mom.

961
01:12:28,889 --> 01:12:30,561
This is my son.

962
01:12:30,929 --> 01:12:34,444
You told me you come here,
that the people are nice.

963
01:12:34,649 --> 01:12:38,164
Put on your shoes,
and come out of the cage.

964
01:12:38,369 --> 01:12:40,564
Who says that to their mother?

965
01:12:40,769 --> 01:12:43,567
- Thank you, Mr. Wellington.
- Lloyd.

966
01:12:48,169 --> 01:12:51,525
- I went on a date tonight.
- With Lloyd?

967
01:12:51,729 --> 01:12:54,368
He's just a friend.
I am so thirsty.

968
01:12:54,609 --> 01:12:58,761
- I'll buy you a drink.
- Lloyd drooled on your shoes.

969
01:13:01,809 --> 01:13:03,527
I went out on a date...

970
01:13:03,729 --> 01:13:07,847
...with a pediatrician I met
in yoga class...

971
01:13:08,049 --> 01:13:09,641
...Dr. Bedsole.

972
01:13:09,849 --> 01:13:13,364
We had a wonderful time.

973
01:13:14,289 --> 01:13:18,282
We went to a movie and had some sushi.
It was a great time.

974
01:13:18,529 --> 01:13:19,848
Sounds great.

975
01:13:20,049 --> 01:13:24,042
So why were you crying
and looking for me?

976
01:13:27,729 --> 01:13:29,287
Ed Bedsole...

977
01:13:30,689 --> 01:13:32,759
...kissed me...

978
01:13:36,089 --> 01:13:37,807
...and I got scared.

979
01:13:38,609 --> 01:13:40,486
Why should that scare you?

980
01:13:40,689 --> 01:13:43,123
I just didn't know how to respond.

981
01:13:43,969 --> 01:13:47,757
I didn't know if I liked it
or hated it.

982
01:13:47,969 --> 01:13:50,358
No one's done that in a long time.

983
01:13:50,609 --> 01:13:54,397
Your father hasn't kissed me for years.
Nothing.

984
01:13:54,609 --> 01:13:58,887
For 30 years there was nothing.
No love, no passion. Nothing.

985
01:13:59,449 --> 01:14:02,646
He never left. He was always there.

986
01:14:04,049 --> 01:14:07,200
To eat. And sleep.
And go to the toilet.

987
01:14:10,529 --> 01:14:13,999
He cheated on me.
Everyone knew that.

988
01:14:15,929 --> 01:14:18,238
He humiliated me.
Do you know that?

989
01:14:21,929 --> 01:14:25,126
You never said anything.
Why didn't you tell me?

990
01:14:25,329 --> 01:14:27,923
You were just a little boy.

991
01:14:28,329 --> 01:14:32,288
You said your funny things,
and ran out of the house.

992
01:14:33,729 --> 01:14:36,118
Then, when you moved away...

993
01:14:36,329 --> 01:14:38,399
...you didn't come around much.

994
01:14:38,609 --> 01:14:43,729
Christmas, and flowers on my birthday.

995
01:14:44,009 --> 01:14:47,638
- Coral-pink roses.
- And a Mother's Day call.

996
01:14:47,849 --> 01:14:50,283
Once from Hawaii.

997
01:14:54,889 --> 01:14:56,686
Well, I'm here now.

998
01:14:59,009 --> 01:15:01,239
I know you're here now.

999
01:15:01,449 --> 01:15:05,442
I have a chance to talk about this,
but I am embarrassed.

1000
01:15:07,769 --> 01:15:10,329
A mother shouldn't
say this to her son.

1001
01:15:16,849 --> 01:15:19,568
I wish I'd been
a better mother, David.

1002
01:15:20,129 --> 01:15:22,085
- You did fine.
- No.

1003
01:15:22,609 --> 01:15:24,839
I wanted to do better.

1004
01:15:26,609 --> 01:15:28,645
I didn't even do fine.

1005
01:15:29,529 --> 01:15:32,043
I wanted to do more for you.

1006
01:15:33,369 --> 01:15:35,883
I'm going to the ladies' room.

1007
01:15:44,969 --> 01:15:47,927
Are you crazy?
It's four in the morning.

1008
01:15:48,129 --> 01:15:51,201
You just tell me.
What did you do to her?

1009
01:15:51,409 --> 01:15:54,003
- To who?
- Mom's afraid of other men.

1010
01:15:54,209 --> 01:15:56,040
What the hell did you do?

1011
01:15:56,249 --> 01:15:59,002
I gave her a name. That's what I did.

1012
01:15:59,209 --> 01:16:00,608
I gave her a son.

1013
01:16:00,809 --> 01:16:03,687
I gave her food and clothes
for 36 years.

1014
01:16:03,889 --> 01:16:07,518
- I did pretty good.
- Did you ever say you loved her?

1015
01:16:07,729 --> 01:16:11,358
That's none of your goddamn business!

1016
01:16:14,009 --> 01:16:16,204
Yeah, it is my business.

1017
01:16:16,409 --> 01:16:20,288
You cheated on my mom.
Then you made her feel dirty.

1018
01:16:20,569 --> 01:16:23,561
You have no right
to talk to me like that.

1019
01:16:23,769 --> 01:16:26,806
That's between your mother and me,
not you.

1020
01:16:27,009 --> 01:16:30,638
I grew up in this house!
You kicked my ass for years!

1021
01:16:30,849 --> 01:16:32,760
Now you're doing pretty good.

1022
01:16:32,969 --> 01:16:36,484
You got a jeep, money,
and you're boffing everything.

1023
01:16:36,689 --> 01:16:38,566
I did something right.

1024
01:16:38,769 --> 01:16:43,399
Now that I'm an adult you approve?
You never did when I was a kid!

1025
01:16:43,649 --> 01:16:48,006
I never knew what you were saying!
You were a moody little shit!

1026
01:16:48,209 --> 01:16:52,248
Whenever I took a pee,
you'd have a seahorse funeral!

1027
01:16:55,089 --> 01:16:58,445
Why don't you get
the hell out of here?

1028
01:16:58,689 --> 01:17:01,920
Tell me what you did to my mother.

1029
01:17:06,889 --> 01:17:10,086
You want to know, so I'll tell you.

1030
01:17:10,289 --> 01:17:12,883
From the first night
on our honeymoon...

1031
01:17:13,089 --> 01:17:16,001
...she laid there like a wet rag.

1032
01:17:16,209 --> 01:17:19,246
She was frigid, David.
Your mother was frigid.

1033
01:17:20,049 --> 01:17:23,405
- She wouldn't do what I asked of her.
- She didn't know.

1034
01:17:23,649 --> 01:17:26,641
Just out of Catholic school,
it repulsed her!

1035
01:17:26,929 --> 01:17:31,047
When you go to bed... When you go to
bed, you want to have fun.

1036
01:17:31,849 --> 01:17:35,888
I was her husband, goddamn it!
I wanted some pleasure!

1037
01:17:37,209 --> 01:17:40,087
So I went out and
got it someplace else.

1038
01:17:41,089 --> 01:17:43,444
Yeah, of course you did.

1039
01:17:43,689 --> 01:17:45,725
Your best friend is your dick!

1040
01:17:45,929 --> 01:17:48,523
And where did I learn that?

1041
01:17:48,729 --> 01:17:52,324
Great! Us four will
go out to lunch someday!

1042
01:17:54,529 --> 01:17:58,363
You ran around and acted
like this was a boarding house!

1043
01:17:58,609 --> 01:18:01,123
I grew up in a boarding house, Dad!

1044
01:18:01,329 --> 01:18:04,605
Thank you. I found out
what you did to us.

1045
01:18:04,809 --> 01:18:07,881
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute!

1046
01:18:08,089 --> 01:18:09,761
It was very tough...

1047
01:18:09,969 --> 01:18:12,767
...all of those dreadful things
I did.

1048
01:18:12,969 --> 01:18:16,848
That's how I was brought up.
And I did the best I could!

1049
01:18:17,049 --> 01:18:20,405
Tomorrow I'm doing a
commercial with a family...

1050
01:18:20,649 --> 01:18:22,162
...that loves each other.

1051
01:18:22,849 --> 01:18:24,521
I'm faking it.

1052
01:18:31,089 --> 01:18:33,649
I'm Michelle Wilson.
Call me Mishi.

1053
01:18:33,849 --> 01:18:36,921
Often we have problems
with our monitors.

1054
01:18:37,129 --> 01:18:39,404
See that bouncing black bar?

1055
01:18:39,649 --> 01:18:43,005
It helps when you go like that.
It disappears.

1056
01:18:43,209 --> 01:18:45,165
Not like that. Up and down.

1057
01:18:45,369 --> 01:18:47,837
- Ready?
- Can't we watch there?

1058
01:18:48,049 --> 01:18:50,927
- Sure.
- Quiet, please.

1059
01:18:51,129 --> 01:18:52,642
We're rolling.

1060
01:18:52,849 --> 01:18:55,568
- Colonial Airlines, 4-8, take 1.
- Mark.

1061
01:18:55,769 --> 01:18:57,441
Snow, Bernie.

1062
01:18:57,649 --> 01:18:59,844
And... action!

1063
01:19:00,049 --> 01:19:02,085
We pull back on a cold day.

1064
01:19:02,289 --> 01:19:05,087
We see Grandma by the hearth...

1065
01:19:05,289 --> 01:19:07,564
...and the phone rings.

1066
01:19:08,449 --> 01:19:10,360
Cut! Cut!

1067
01:19:10,609 --> 01:19:12,918
Cut?! Did you say cut?

1068
01:19:13,129 --> 01:19:16,838
I'm the director!
Only I say "action" and "cut."

1069
01:19:17,049 --> 01:19:18,926
Learn to say "action"...

1070
01:19:19,129 --> 01:19:20,960
...since you know "cut."

1071
01:19:21,169 --> 01:19:22,727
Do you hear me?

1072
01:19:25,449 --> 01:19:27,360
What will we do? She's drunk.

1073
01:19:27,609 --> 01:19:29,679
I know. Roger?

1074
01:19:30,609 --> 01:19:33,965
- You already did a drunk-driving spot.
- Yeah.

1075
01:19:34,169 --> 01:19:35,648
A little casting tip:

1076
01:19:35,849 --> 01:19:38,158
Next time, hire a sober actress.

1077
01:19:38,369 --> 01:19:40,007
Not next to the clients.

1078
01:19:40,209 --> 01:19:42,598
You don't need a bullhorn!

1079
01:19:42,809 --> 01:19:44,208
She's hard of hearing.

1080
01:19:44,409 --> 01:19:47,446
Drunk and deaf?
How'd she know to show up?

1081
01:19:47,689 --> 01:19:49,566
I did not hire this actress.

1082
01:19:49,769 --> 01:19:51,248
Don't be so testy.

1083
01:19:51,449 --> 01:19:53,724
This is the face that they want.

1084
01:19:53,929 --> 01:19:57,001
- So we will make it work.
- Yes, yes, we will.

1085
01:19:57,209 --> 01:19:59,200
Pour coffee down...
Whatever.

1086
01:19:59,769 --> 01:20:01,885
- Get me some coffee.
- Yes, sir.

1087
01:20:02,089 --> 01:20:03,363
Do we have decaf?

1088
01:20:03,569 --> 01:20:06,242
This snow is too thick.
Practice, Bernie.

1089
01:20:06,449 --> 01:20:10,761
- My father wants to have lunch.
- I don't have time for lunch.

1090
01:20:10,969 --> 01:20:13,483
Bernie, can we make
actual flakes?

1091
01:20:13,689 --> 01:20:17,398
Just a little problem.
The cup was wet and it slipped.

1092
01:20:17,649 --> 01:20:20,402
She's so sweet.
We'll give her a break.

1093
01:20:20,609 --> 01:20:24,124
I want to show you
the other stage now.

1094
01:20:24,329 --> 01:20:26,889
What are you doing?
Get out of here.

1095
01:20:28,289 --> 01:20:31,087
Where's the kid?
He's still in school?

1096
01:20:31,289 --> 01:20:33,849
You can step out while
they set up.

1097
01:20:34,569 --> 01:20:37,879
- What's this?
- A housecat. You want it more exotic?

1098
01:20:38,089 --> 01:20:41,161
- Where did we get a cat?
- Roger said get a cat.

1099
01:20:41,369 --> 01:20:44,167
Lose the cat. Roger!
Get it out of here!

1100
01:20:44,369 --> 01:20:48,123
- A cat?
- She could say goodbye to the cat.

1101
01:20:48,329 --> 01:20:50,445
- Oh. That's a good idea.
- Yeah.

1102
01:20:50,649 --> 01:20:52,765
Let's do one about
a grandma...

1103
01:20:52,969 --> 01:20:55,563
...who abandons a cat
in winter...

1104
01:20:55,769 --> 01:20:58,442
...so she can romp
with her grandkids!

1105
01:20:58,689 --> 01:21:03,046
We can show the cat trying to
claw its way out to get food!

1106
01:21:03,249 --> 01:21:06,207
Are there more animals...

1107
01:21:06,409 --> 01:21:08,764
...that Grandma can torture?

1108
01:21:08,969 --> 01:21:11,358
Maybe put a squirrel
in the fire?

1109
01:21:11,609 --> 01:21:14,407
Do we want to work
in advertising? No!

1110
01:21:14,649 --> 01:21:17,721
- What're you looking at?
- Go smash this.

1111
01:21:17,929 --> 01:21:21,205
- Let's take a break.
- We haven't had too many!

1112
01:21:21,409 --> 01:21:24,207
- What are these people...
- Just relax!

1113
01:21:24,409 --> 01:21:27,560
Come on! It's me! Come on!

1114
01:21:30,769 --> 01:21:34,523
Why don't you just go home, huh?

1115
01:21:34,729 --> 01:21:38,324
- What's the problem?
- I'm sorry. I had a bad night.

1116
01:21:38,569 --> 01:21:39,558
I'm sorry.

1117
01:21:39,889 --> 01:21:43,359
- You laying some bad pipe?
- It's nothing like that.

1118
01:21:44,009 --> 01:21:45,442
My old man.

1119
01:21:46,049 --> 01:21:48,802
I don't talk to mine, so I don't know.

1120
01:21:50,209 --> 01:21:54,088
Do you remember when
we worked in the mailroom?

1121
01:21:54,649 --> 01:21:59,279
We found out that we were fired,
so we shredded the mail.

1122
01:21:59,529 --> 01:22:01,804
Look at us now, huh?

1123
01:22:02,009 --> 01:22:04,887
These people actually think
we know our job.

1124
01:22:05,089 --> 01:22:07,922
It's a laugh. Isn't it?

1125
01:22:09,249 --> 01:22:12,958
Come on, we said we'd do it
as long as it was fun.

1126
01:22:13,689 --> 01:22:16,681
Why don't you go home,
go to Lincoln Park?

1127
01:22:16,889 --> 01:22:21,246
Let me take care of things.
It's just a commercial.

1128
01:22:26,049 --> 01:22:27,960
Let me see those eyes.

1129
01:22:28,169 --> 01:22:29,807
Right. All right.

1130
01:22:50,809 --> 01:22:51,719
Coffee?

1131
01:22:51,929 --> 01:22:54,079
- Sorry.
- Just keep an eye on things.

1132
01:22:54,289 --> 01:22:56,405
- Is he coming back?
- I don't know.

1133
01:22:58,729 --> 01:23:01,118
He told me to keep an eye on things.

1134
01:23:03,449 --> 01:23:06,521
- Ms. Wayne wants the...
- The copy. I know.

1135
01:23:06,729 --> 01:23:08,924
You don't make jokes anymore.

1136
01:23:09,129 --> 01:23:10,642
You liked those jokes?

1137
01:23:10,849 --> 01:23:12,965
Yeah.

1138
01:23:13,169 --> 01:23:14,761
So did I.

1139
01:23:49,569 --> 01:23:51,127
Hey, Dad?

1140
01:23:53,689 --> 01:23:54,678
Dad?

1141
01:24:00,089 --> 01:24:01,966
Come on, Dad...

1142
01:24:04,009 --> 01:24:08,400
All right. I'm sorry.

1143
01:24:08,649 --> 01:24:11,800
I called all week.
I'm tired of you hanging up.

1144
01:24:12,009 --> 01:24:13,965
I bought some groceries, Dad.

1145
01:24:14,329 --> 01:24:17,002
Mom is sitting like a zombie...

1146
01:24:17,209 --> 01:24:19,006
...recovering from her date.

1147
01:24:19,209 --> 01:24:21,677
I don't know what
you're doing in there.

1148
01:24:22,249 --> 01:24:23,967
Let me take you out, huh?

1149
01:24:24,169 --> 01:24:27,639
You pick the place.
We'll listen to music.

1150
01:24:27,849 --> 01:24:29,760
That's jazz, right?
Jazz music?

1151
01:24:31,409 --> 01:24:33,604
Come on!

1152
01:25:13,529 --> 01:25:15,759
Doesn't that do something to you?

1153
01:25:15,969 --> 01:25:18,881
- Doesn't that do something to you?
- No.

1154
01:25:19,569 --> 01:25:24,006
- Can we go? It's four in the morning.
- What four in the morning?

1155
01:25:26,929 --> 01:25:29,204
Where are your new glasses?

1156
01:25:29,409 --> 01:25:31,240
I lost my slipper someplace.

1157
01:25:31,849 --> 01:25:34,841
Dad? Where are your new glasses?

1158
01:25:35,049 --> 01:25:38,405
They're being fixed.
They didn't fit right.

1159
01:25:38,609 --> 01:25:40,759
...that's about it for tonight.

1160
01:25:40,969 --> 01:25:43,642
Wait a minute, Conrad.
One more time.

1161
01:25:43,849 --> 01:25:45,567
Max, give us a break.

1162
01:25:45,769 --> 01:25:48,044
I haven't even drank my minimum.

1163
01:25:48,249 --> 01:25:50,399
All right, one more time.

1164
01:25:50,649 --> 01:25:53,447
"When the Saints."
One, two, one.

1165
01:26:01,609 --> 01:26:03,440
You didn't go in.

1166
01:26:04,809 --> 01:26:07,881
You didn't go in to
see the doctor, did you?

1167
01:26:10,369 --> 01:26:14,442
I'll get your goddamn slipper.
Then I'm taking you home.

1168
01:26:45,769 --> 01:26:48,283
I'm not staying
in this lousy hospital!

1169
01:26:48,529 --> 01:26:51,362
I'm feeling fine!
I'm going home!

1170
01:26:51,569 --> 01:26:54,845
Let me out of this chair!
Let me out of this chair!

1171
01:26:55,049 --> 01:26:56,767
Let me out of this thing!

1172
01:26:56,969 --> 01:27:00,120
Get your hand off!
I'll claim malpractice!

1173
01:27:00,329 --> 01:27:01,239
I'll handle it.

1174
01:27:01,449 --> 01:27:04,327
- You'll handle nothing!
- It has to be tomorrow.

1175
01:27:04,529 --> 01:27:07,441
Tomorrow, bullshit!
I won't be here!

1176
01:27:07,649 --> 01:27:11,642
If anybody touches my legs,
I'll brain the son of a bitch!

1177
01:27:11,849 --> 01:27:13,805
You've got no choice!

1178
01:27:14,009 --> 01:27:16,318
I knew he'd find something wrong!

1179
01:27:16,529 --> 01:27:19,362
Something is wrong with you!
Put this on.

1180
01:27:19,569 --> 01:27:21,446
I won't!
Your ass hangs out!

1181
01:27:21,649 --> 01:27:23,287
So sleep on your back!

1182
01:27:23,529 --> 01:27:28,159
Don't hang anything up, because
I'm getting out of here!

1183
01:27:29,449 --> 01:27:33,920
Don't tell any of his friends.
He doesn't want them to know.

1184
01:27:34,769 --> 01:27:36,168
How serious is it?

1185
01:27:36,369 --> 01:27:38,519
He could lose his legs.

1186
01:27:40,129 --> 01:27:43,041
Definitely parts of both feet.

1187
01:27:44,049 --> 01:27:45,687
But he'll live?

1188
01:27:45,889 --> 01:27:48,608
Doctor gave me the
malpractice bullshit.

1189
01:27:48,809 --> 01:27:51,881
He said that it's
a major operation...

1190
01:27:52,089 --> 01:27:55,365
...that with patients of Dad's
age and condition...

1191
01:27:55,569 --> 01:28:00,404
...complications could set in
because of the anesthesia and shock.

1192
01:28:00,649 --> 01:28:02,765
That means that he could...

1193
01:28:02,969 --> 01:28:05,437
He could die.
He could cash it in...

1194
01:28:05,649 --> 01:28:07,162
...kick the bucket.

1195
01:28:07,369 --> 01:28:11,806
He could shuffle loose the mortal coil.

1196
01:28:12,009 --> 01:28:14,648
All right, David!
That's enough.

1197
01:28:19,249 --> 01:28:21,365
I knew he was sick.

1198
01:28:21,609 --> 01:28:24,362
Oh, well,
he knew he was sick too.

1199
01:28:24,609 --> 01:28:28,079
But you don't die from diabetes.

1200
01:28:28,289 --> 01:28:31,838
You do if you let it go
this long, Mom.

1201
01:28:32,049 --> 01:28:36,167
It's the number three
cause of death in this country.

1202
01:28:36,369 --> 01:28:39,964
I read this in
a pamphlet at the hospital.

1203
01:28:40,169 --> 01:28:43,047
It's not my fault
that it went this far.

1204
01:28:44,169 --> 01:28:46,729
He knew.
He didn't see a doctor.

1205
01:28:46,929 --> 01:28:50,365
He is a grown man.
I couldn't make him go.

1206
01:28:50,609 --> 01:28:53,681
He smokes cigars before breakfast!

1207
01:28:53,889 --> 01:28:55,117
It's not my fault.

1208
01:28:55,329 --> 01:28:57,047
I know, Mom.

1209
01:28:59,209 --> 01:29:03,043
- Let me make you French toast.
- No, I'm late for work.

1210
01:29:08,809 --> 01:29:12,040
Your home to our home

1211
01:29:12,249 --> 01:29:15,639
To their home

1212
01:29:15,849 --> 01:29:19,364
Colonial Airlines

1213
01:29:19,609 --> 01:29:22,840
Your home in the...

1214
01:29:23,049 --> 01:29:25,847
...sky

1215
01:29:27,449 --> 01:29:30,202
Are there any questions?

1216
01:29:30,409 --> 01:29:33,401
We've just bought
three jumbo aircrafts.

1217
01:29:33,609 --> 01:29:35,406
You didn't mention them.

1218
01:29:35,649 --> 01:29:38,209
We're excited
about the acquisition.

1219
01:29:38,409 --> 01:29:42,197
But it's a tiny part of the fleet
compared to others.

1220
01:29:42,409 --> 01:29:45,606
We showed that you have
more short flights...

1221
01:29:45,809 --> 01:29:49,119
...than any other carrier.
Next question?

1222
01:29:49,409 --> 01:29:52,799
We have a perfect safety record.
You didn't say that.

1223
01:29:53,009 --> 01:29:54,408
It could backfire.

1224
01:29:54,609 --> 01:29:58,363
People think it's luck and wonder
when it will run out.

1225
01:29:58,609 --> 01:30:02,648
We'll use it, but not in mass market.
It's too iffy.

1226
01:30:02,849 --> 01:30:04,487
Suppose we insisted.

1227
01:30:04,689 --> 01:30:06,839
- I'd say no.
- Lf you couldn't?

1228
01:30:07,049 --> 01:30:10,837
I'd walk away. It's a bad move.
I won't be responsible.

1229
01:30:11,049 --> 01:30:14,962
Good enough.
Who cares about safety records?

1230
01:30:15,209 --> 01:30:18,440
This man has a campaign to do.

1231
01:30:18,689 --> 01:30:22,125
This campaign will knock
them on their duff!

1232
01:30:22,569 --> 01:30:25,766
You've got an hour to
meet me at the airport.

1233
01:30:25,969 --> 01:30:28,437
We have the presentation in
New York.

1234
01:30:28,649 --> 01:30:31,721
Oh, yeah, that would be today.

1235
01:30:31,929 --> 01:30:35,126
I'm sorry, I can't make it.
Mustard.

1236
01:30:35,329 --> 01:30:36,808
What?

1237
01:30:37,009 --> 01:30:39,443
I'm not going. My father is ill.

1238
01:30:40,049 --> 01:30:41,960
Well, put him in a hospital.

1239
01:30:42,169 --> 01:30:46,560
I did. But he needs surgery,
and I want to be there.

1240
01:30:46,769 --> 01:30:47,804
Why?

1241
01:30:49,289 --> 01:30:50,847
Why?

1242
01:30:51,049 --> 01:30:53,085
I said we have a meeting.

1243
01:30:53,289 --> 01:30:56,645
I heard you, twice.
I told you I'm not going.

1244
01:30:56,849 --> 01:30:59,727
- Where's Charlie Gargas?
- In Los Angeles.

1245
01:31:00,609 --> 01:31:01,519
Call him.

1246
01:31:01,729 --> 01:31:03,765
- He'll be back this...
- Now!

1247
01:31:03,969 --> 01:31:07,882
Mr. Woolridge, Ted Geller can go.

1248
01:31:08,089 --> 01:31:10,603
- I hired you.
- He's familiar with it.

1249
01:31:10,809 --> 01:31:12,128
Can you talk to him?

1250
01:31:12,329 --> 01:31:16,607
Basner, you have to make the
presentation to our board.

1251
01:31:16,809 --> 01:31:19,846
You have good doctors,
you don't have to stay.

1252
01:31:20,329 --> 01:31:23,878
No, I don't, but I'm going to.

1253
01:31:24,169 --> 01:31:26,125
You're not going to New York?

1254
01:31:26,329 --> 01:31:28,081
I'm not going to New York.

1255
01:31:28,289 --> 01:31:31,201
Look, I'm serious.
I've had enough of this.

1256
01:31:31,409 --> 01:31:32,808
If you want this...

1257
01:31:33,009 --> 01:31:36,718
...you'll get up
off your ass, get packed...

1258
01:31:36,929 --> 01:31:38,328
I'm counting now.

1259
01:31:38,569 --> 01:31:39,888
One!

1260
01:31:40,409 --> 01:31:41,444
Two!

1261
01:31:41,929 --> 01:31:43,999
- Three!
- Jesus Christ!

1262
01:31:44,209 --> 01:31:45,005
Four!

1263
01:31:45,209 --> 01:31:47,848
- He really is counting.
- Five! Six!

1264
01:31:48,049 --> 01:31:51,280
This is the 20th century.
Sir, I'm not...

1265
01:31:51,529 --> 01:31:53,520
...a shit-kicker from your farm.

1266
01:31:53,729 --> 01:31:55,640
Ten!

1267
01:31:55,849 --> 01:31:57,999
Look, I'm done! Take my stuff!

1268
01:31:58,209 --> 01:31:59,961
Do what you want...

1269
01:32:00,169 --> 01:32:02,080
...but I'm not going!

1270
01:32:02,289 --> 01:32:05,725
And don't you ever
fucking touch me again!

1271
01:32:14,049 --> 01:32:15,562
Fire him.

1272
01:32:27,329 --> 01:32:28,648
Quite a show.

1273
01:32:28,849 --> 01:32:32,603
What do you do for an encore?
Burn down a building?

1274
01:32:36,969 --> 01:32:39,039
Did you just make a joke?

1275
01:32:40,009 --> 01:32:42,728
You did, didn't you?
You made a joke.

1276
01:32:42,929 --> 01:32:46,001
Not a great joke,
but you made a joke.

1277
01:32:46,209 --> 01:32:47,358
Cheryl Ann!

1278
01:32:47,609 --> 01:32:50,840
You made light of a heavy situation!
Sense of humor!

1279
01:32:51,049 --> 01:32:54,519
You do, you have one.

1280
01:32:54,729 --> 01:32:57,243
I worked damn hard on this with you.

1281
01:32:57,449 --> 01:33:00,247
I thought that
you were a professional.

1282
01:33:00,449 --> 01:33:02,167
I'm as committed as you.

1283
01:33:02,369 --> 01:33:05,679
I'm going to New York.
You're staying.

1284
01:33:05,889 --> 01:33:08,449
- We have different priorities.
- We do.

1285
01:33:08,649 --> 01:33:11,846
I'm surprised too.
I thought we were the same.

1286
01:33:12,929 --> 01:33:15,921
That's what's sad.
We were a good team.

1287
01:33:16,129 --> 01:33:19,678
I looked forward to seeing you
every morning.

1288
01:33:19,889 --> 01:33:23,438
Wondering what you'd wear,
what you'd say...

1289
01:33:23,689 --> 01:33:27,443
...and how you were gonna tease me...

1290
01:33:27,689 --> 01:33:30,567
...and when we'd
find time to make love.

1291
01:33:31,769 --> 01:33:34,886
You made all
of these exhausting hours fun.

1292
01:33:35,849 --> 01:33:38,807
That I'm gonna miss.
It's hard to find.

1293
01:33:42,929 --> 01:33:45,727
I'll miss you, David.

1294
01:33:45,929 --> 01:33:47,601
Very much.

1295
01:33:55,609 --> 01:33:57,327
You're fired.

1296
01:34:02,089 --> 01:34:05,684
You know, I liked
being with you too.

1297
01:34:05,889 --> 01:34:09,768
You're gonna make a lucky
corporation one hell of a CEO.

1298
01:34:10,129 --> 01:34:12,563
Ms. Wayne, your limo's waiting.

1299
01:34:15,089 --> 01:34:17,319
I do hope your father's okay.

1300
01:34:19,369 --> 01:34:20,688
Where are my copies?

1301
01:34:20,889 --> 01:34:22,925
On my desk, I'll meet you there.

1302
01:34:30,609 --> 01:34:33,248
Hey, will you get out?
I'm creating.

1303
01:34:33,449 --> 01:34:36,725
This is where I do my best work.
Get out!

1304
01:34:36,929 --> 01:34:38,920
Oh, it's only the boss.

1305
01:34:41,289 --> 01:34:42,517
I was sleeping.

1306
01:34:42,729 --> 01:34:45,368
I'm sorry I was gone.
I missed the fireworks.

1307
01:34:45,609 --> 01:34:48,965
You know everyone in L.A.
Has odd-colored hair?

1308
01:34:49,169 --> 01:34:51,444
I saw someone that drew it in.

1309
01:34:51,649 --> 01:34:55,085
Here I am buying hair.
I'll never understand L.A.

1310
01:34:55,289 --> 01:34:57,166
Did we lose the account?

1311
01:34:57,369 --> 01:34:59,678
No, I calmed Woolridge down.

1312
01:34:59,889 --> 01:35:03,040
I told him that I'd throw you
out of a plane...

1313
01:35:03,249 --> 01:35:05,638
...you know,
the usual punishment.

1314
01:35:05,849 --> 01:35:07,805
I'm not a partner by accident.

1315
01:35:08,009 --> 01:35:11,160
I'll apologize to you.
But not to anyone else.

1316
01:35:11,369 --> 01:35:14,247
It's been hard to
deal with all of this.

1317
01:35:16,169 --> 01:35:17,841
Join the club.

1318
01:35:22,929 --> 01:35:24,248
At the end...

1319
01:35:26,449 --> 01:35:30,567
...my dad was in a home.
It was the best in Illinois.

1320
01:35:30,769 --> 01:35:33,567
I was too busy to visit him much.

1321
01:35:33,769 --> 01:35:36,567
But I figured he was well cared-for.

1322
01:35:36,769 --> 01:35:40,284
He was a little senile.
Not much.

1323
01:35:43,409 --> 01:35:46,526
When I got around to seeing him...

1324
01:35:46,729 --> 01:35:49,527
...he didn't recognize me until he died.

1325
01:35:51,129 --> 01:35:53,689
He didn't remember who I was.

1326
01:35:56,409 --> 01:35:59,799
I thought you'd be
the perfect son, Charlie.

1327
01:36:00,729 --> 01:36:04,563
No, they tell me there
was only one of those guys.

1328
01:36:07,249 --> 01:36:09,604
You take care of what you've got...

1329
01:36:09,809 --> 01:36:11,845
...l'll take care of Woolridge.

1330
01:36:12,049 --> 01:36:13,528
Thanks.

1331
01:36:20,889 --> 01:36:23,403
I brought you some stuff from home.

1332
01:36:23,649 --> 01:36:24,968
Okay, all finished.

1333
01:36:25,449 --> 01:36:27,917
Thank you, Harvey. Wait a minute.

1334
01:36:28,129 --> 01:36:30,723
Here. Have a pen.

1335
01:36:30,929 --> 01:36:32,681
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

1336
01:36:32,889 --> 01:36:34,720
- You're welcome.
- Bye-bye.

1337
01:36:40,049 --> 01:36:41,323
You'll be fine.

1338
01:36:41,569 --> 01:36:44,447
Just as long as you aren't my doctor.

1339
01:36:44,689 --> 01:36:47,886
Come on, I could have
been a great doctor.

1340
01:36:48,089 --> 01:36:50,922
You could have been
a great anything.

1341
01:36:55,729 --> 01:36:57,367
Today was crazy at work.

1342
01:36:57,609 --> 01:36:59,804
But I'll be here.
I'm gonna go...

1343
01:37:00,009 --> 01:37:01,488
...get cleaned up...

1344
01:37:01,689 --> 01:37:06,365
...and I'll be here tomorrow.
I'll be here when you get back.

1345
01:37:06,609 --> 01:37:08,839
In other words, you'll be here.

1346
01:37:12,249 --> 01:37:15,127
Why don't you go now,
so I can sleep.

1347
01:37:15,329 --> 01:37:17,240
Or I'll be grumpy tomorrow...

1348
01:37:17,449 --> 01:37:20,088
...and I won't enjoy the operation.

1349
01:37:20,889 --> 01:37:23,039
Well, see you tomorrow.

1350
01:38:13,969 --> 01:38:18,121
I don't have any blood left,
so you can get out.

1351
01:38:37,089 --> 01:38:39,284
I was in the neighborhood.

1352
01:38:43,009 --> 01:38:45,443
What's new?
How are you doing?

1353
01:38:46,369 --> 01:38:49,042
Fine. I'm doing fine.

1354
01:38:50,089 --> 01:38:52,523
I take your word for it.

1355
01:38:53,929 --> 01:38:55,681
Can I offer you something?

1356
01:38:55,889 --> 01:38:59,768
Cookie? Glass of water?
Some morphine?

1357
01:39:00,649 --> 01:39:03,038
Thank you. I'll take a cookie.

1358
01:39:03,249 --> 01:39:04,728
David brought them.

1359
01:39:04,969 --> 01:39:08,405
They're that delicious diabetic kind.

1360
01:39:08,849 --> 01:39:11,568
It's all they'll
let me eat around here.

1361
01:39:12,249 --> 01:39:15,924
I could be dead tomorrow.
They're putting me on a diet.

1362
01:39:17,249 --> 01:39:20,002
I can still make you laugh, can't I?

1363
01:39:20,609 --> 01:39:25,160
When you wanted to, you could make me
laugh. Right from the beginning.

1364
01:39:25,649 --> 01:39:27,879
I was one charming guy, wasn't I?

1365
01:39:28,089 --> 01:39:31,001
- To everybody except my mother.
- Shit.

1366
01:39:33,569 --> 01:39:35,161
What were we, Max?

1367
01:39:35,369 --> 01:39:40,079
Two kids who thought if you went
on a couple of dates, you got married.

1368
01:39:40,289 --> 01:39:44,521
What couple of dates?
We went out eight or nine times!

1369
01:39:44,729 --> 01:39:46,685
We had plenty of laughs.

1370
01:39:46,889 --> 01:39:50,325
I tried to teach you how
to drive that old Hudson.

1371
01:39:57,409 --> 01:40:01,846
I wish there were more
things like that.

1372
01:40:02,209 --> 01:40:04,279
More moments.

1373
01:40:05,889 --> 01:40:10,201
We lived together a long time, Max,
but we were never friends.

1374
01:40:11,409 --> 01:40:14,799
Lorraine, you didn't know
how to have fun.

1375
01:40:15,009 --> 01:40:17,159
- Why didn't you teach me?
- I tried.

1376
01:40:17,369 --> 01:40:21,840
- I tried a million goddamn times!
- No, just a few times!

1377
01:40:22,049 --> 01:40:25,564
- Then you just gave up on me.
- You did the same thing!

1378
01:40:32,809 --> 01:40:35,277
Why didn't we talk, Max?

1379
01:40:35,529 --> 01:40:38,680
Why didn't we tell each other
how we felt?

1380
01:40:41,409 --> 01:40:44,003
Do you know what we were, Max?

1381
01:40:44,929 --> 01:40:47,523
We were roommates.

1382
01:40:49,369 --> 01:40:53,362
Goddamn you for doing what
you did to yourself!

1383
01:40:53,849 --> 01:40:56,124
What you did to us.

1384
01:40:57,049 --> 01:41:00,598
Oh, God, what happened to us, Max?

1385
01:41:01,649 --> 01:41:03,719
I cared.

1386
01:41:04,729 --> 01:41:06,367
I know I cared.

1387
01:41:10,049 --> 01:41:11,687
Bullshit.

1388
01:42:09,569 --> 01:42:11,048
I'm here, Dad.

1389
01:42:11,249 --> 01:42:12,967
You're here.

1390
01:42:22,649 --> 01:42:24,879
It's a Honduran, Dad.

1391
01:42:25,929 --> 01:42:29,888
In case they give you
time for a smoke break.

1392
01:42:37,529 --> 01:42:40,760
Excuse me.
We have to take him to surgery now.

1393
01:43:42,809 --> 01:43:46,882
You look so distinguished, Charlie.
It's coming along great.

1394
01:43:47,329 --> 01:43:50,765
Could we have some makeup?
We have a bit of a shine.

1395
01:43:51,129 --> 01:43:52,039
Thanks.

1396
01:43:52,409 --> 01:43:55,640
- Everyone must leave. He has a call.
- I'll be back.

1397
01:43:55,849 --> 01:43:58,886
- Everybody, let's take five minutes.
- Thank you.

1398
01:44:04,649 --> 01:44:07,117
David, how is he?

1399
01:44:07,409 --> 01:44:10,003
He lost his toes
and part of one foot...

1400
01:44:10,209 --> 01:44:12,848
...but he can walk again
with a cane.

1401
01:44:14,769 --> 01:44:18,887
Thank God it wasn't worse.
When are you coming back to work?

1402
01:44:19,089 --> 01:44:21,762
You're missing my photos
with a naked head.

1403
01:44:23,769 --> 01:44:25,760
I don't know.

1404
01:44:25,969 --> 01:44:28,244
I don't know, Charlie.

1405
01:44:28,849 --> 01:44:32,967
Why don't you give my accounts
to Ted Geller till I come back.

1406
01:44:33,449 --> 01:44:36,168
Babysitting him will drive you crazy.

1407
01:44:38,129 --> 01:44:39,528
Well, maybe.

1408
01:44:39,729 --> 01:44:41,799
But I want to get to know him.

1409
01:44:42,009 --> 01:44:45,319
You never know, he may get
to know me a little too.

1410
01:44:47,729 --> 01:44:48,718
Good luck.

1411
01:44:50,129 --> 01:44:52,040
Thanks, Charlie.

1412
01:44:52,809 --> 01:44:56,040
Don't give up my window.

1413
01:44:56,649 --> 01:44:58,048
Bye-bye.

1414
01:45:08,329 --> 01:45:12,038
- They'll put him to bed soon, sir.
- Thank you.

1415
01:45:58,889 --> 01:46:03,280
I filled the refrigerator, so there
will be food when he comes home.

1416
01:46:03,529 --> 01:46:06,202
And I have some keys for you.

1417
01:46:06,409 --> 01:46:09,207
You'll be needing a second set.

1418
01:46:09,409 --> 01:46:11,365
I won't be coming back.

1419
01:46:14,729 --> 01:46:17,926
Your father might not
get any better, David.

1420
01:46:18,609 --> 01:46:21,760
He's going to need a lot of care.

1421
01:46:23,969 --> 01:46:26,324
I can't...

1422
01:46:26,929 --> 01:46:30,080
I mean, he and I, it's just...

1423
01:46:30,609 --> 01:46:33,077
...impossible.

1424
01:46:33,289 --> 01:46:35,120
It just doesn't work.

1425
01:46:35,889 --> 01:46:37,766
I know, Mom.

1426
01:46:40,809 --> 01:46:43,039
Do you hate me for that?

1427
01:46:44,569 --> 01:46:46,002
No.

1428
01:46:46,609 --> 01:46:49,169
I do not hate you.
You're my mom.

1429
01:46:52,689 --> 01:46:54,327
Call me.

1430
01:47:15,969 --> 01:47:17,561
- Go get the car.
- Yeah.

1431
01:47:17,769 --> 01:47:20,920
- The blue station wagon, right?
- Thanks.

1432
01:47:23,529 --> 01:47:25,087
I found you.

1433
01:47:25,769 --> 01:47:30,206
- I'm taking Max home today.
- Your mother told me.

1434
01:47:30,729 --> 01:47:34,324
- Thank you for coming around so much.
- That's okay.

1435
01:47:34,569 --> 01:47:35,922
You're welcome.

1436
01:47:36,329 --> 01:47:37,762
For your theater?

1437
01:47:37,969 --> 01:47:40,437
- The school donated them.
- All three?

1438
01:47:40,689 --> 01:47:42,839
Well, it's a start.

1439
01:47:43,049 --> 01:47:46,883
The kids went to get my car.
I parked in Detroit.

1440
01:47:49,689 --> 01:47:53,045
You're the only girl I dated
that my parents liked.

1441
01:47:53,969 --> 01:47:58,167
I'm the only girl you dated
that your parents ever met.

1442
01:48:09,529 --> 01:48:11,599
This is comfortable.

1443
01:48:22,289 --> 01:48:24,723
This is very comfortable.

1444
01:48:31,449 --> 01:48:33,758
I think so too.

1445
01:48:51,409 --> 01:48:56,358
- Your son bought you a nice outfit.
- He's always buying me something.

1446
01:48:56,609 --> 01:49:00,124
- Good luck. Thanks for the pen.
- You're welcome, Gina.

1447
01:49:00,329 --> 01:49:04,845
We're signed out. Paid the bill.
Do you people work on commission?

1448
01:49:05,049 --> 01:49:08,564
- The orderly will be at the elevator.
- Thank you.

1449
01:49:17,009 --> 01:49:17,964
You all right?

1450
01:49:20,089 --> 01:49:22,205
That Gina gives a good sponge.

1451
01:49:23,249 --> 01:49:25,126
Let's get out of here.

1452
01:49:37,449 --> 01:49:42,000
You're the last person I thought
would ever come through for me.

1453
01:54:01,729 --> 01:54:02,718
