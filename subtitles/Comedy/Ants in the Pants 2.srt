1
00:00:00,431 --> 00:00:02,569
Cleaning the bathroom
is the most

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:04,228
- valuable thing you do.
- I quit.

3
00:00:04,229 --> 00:00:07,282
I deserve this jacket. It represents
my total unemployability.

4
00:00:07,283 --> 00:00:09,409
I'm just expecting
a text from Brett.

5
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,111
Maybe... be mature
and text him?

6
00:00:11,112 --> 00:00:12,412
Uh... no!

7
00:00:12,413 --> 00:00:15,040
At least you could contact Brett.
I can't even find Jane.

8
00:00:16,523 --> 00:00:19,086
- Who's ready for another?
- Think I'm good.

9
00:00:19,087 --> 00:00:20,787
Yeah, you wouldn't
wanna have a second beer.

10
00:00:20,788 --> 00:00:22,756
You might crash into somebody
on the walk home.

11
00:00:22,757 --> 00:00:24,458
Give her a break.
We gotta wake up early

12
00:00:24,459 --> 00:00:25,659
to prepare for our big bash.

13
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:28,679
This is the first party we've ever
thrown together as a couple.

14
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,681
All of our grad school friends
are gonna be there, so...

15
00:00:30,682 --> 00:00:32,833
Doctor dorks
and law dweebs

16
00:00:32,834 --> 00:00:35,101
this party's gonna be like a
national geographic special

17
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:37,062
on the mating rituals
of the socially challenged.

18
00:00:37,063 --> 00:00:38,021
You're funny.

19
00:00:38,022 --> 00:00:39,815
Is it okay
if I bring somebody?

20
00:00:39,816 --> 00:00:42,025
- Who?
- Brett?

21
00:00:42,026 --> 00:00:43,402
- Ruh-roh.
- What?

22
00:00:43,403 --> 00:00:45,987
When was the last time you even
talked to that hipster tool?

23
00:00:45,988 --> 00:00:47,581
Not since
the ravioli party,

24
00:00:47,582 --> 00:00:50,851
but after my little
social disease scare,

25
00:00:50,852 --> 00:00:53,987
I realized that
I kind of like him.

26
00:00:53,988 --> 00:00:55,722
Wow, a Tina
"I like him"

27
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:57,290
is the equivalent
to most girls'

28
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:59,693
"I'll slit my wrists in a warm
bath if I can't have him."

29
00:00:59,694 --> 00:01:00,627
- [Chuckling]
- Anyway.

30
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:02,095
I thought
I would reach out,

31
00:01:02,096 --> 00:01:04,631
and, you know,
tell him how I feel.

32
00:01:04,632 --> 00:01:06,867
Oh, it sounds like
our little girl's growing up.

33
00:01:06,868 --> 00:01:08,468
Or maybe a sign
of the end times, you know,

34
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:10,011
when the clouds start bleeding,
and animals start talking.

35
00:01:10,012 --> 00:01:11,404
- All: [Chuckling]
- Okay.

36
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,006
We're out.
So we'll see you guys

37
00:01:13,007 --> 00:01:13,932
- tomorrow night?
- Yep.

38
00:01:13,933 --> 00:01:15,575
Retainer and
headgear optional.

39
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:16,852
- Ha, ha.
- Heh.

40
00:01:16,853 --> 00:01:18,745
Actually, I should
probably crash too.

41
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:20,413
- [Whining]
- I'm taking...

42
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:22,649
This placement test
at a temp agency tomorrow.

43
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,651
Seriously, if I don't start
scrounging together

44
00:01:24,652 --> 00:01:26,853
some money soon, I may be
kissing Brooklyn goodbye

45
00:01:26,854 --> 00:01:28,388
- and my parents hello.
- Well...

46
00:01:28,389 --> 00:01:29,789
Maybe you'll meet
a nice girl in St. Louis.

47
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,192
You know, one who loves golf
and making bread.

48
00:01:32,193 --> 00:01:33,326
Sporty and yeasty?

49
00:01:33,327 --> 00:01:35,061
Doesn't sound
too bad to me right now.

50
00:01:35,062 --> 00:01:37,230
God, the only girl I've actually
liked in forever was...

51
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:38,465
- Both: Jane.
- Yeah.

52
00:01:38,466 --> 00:01:40,600
Steals your pants,
leaves a fake number, Jane.

53
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:42,302
If we're gonna have
this conversation again,

54
00:01:42,303 --> 00:01:43,737
I'm gonna need something
harder than a beer.

55
00:01:43,738 --> 00:01:45,038
Sorry.

56
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:46,506
Well, hopefully by the time
you see me tomorrow,

57
00:01:46,507 --> 00:01:49,885
I will be an employed,
tax-paying member of society.

58
00:01:49,886 --> 00:01:52,412
You will be, Jay.
And I'll be with Brett.

59
00:01:52,413 --> 00:01:54,381
Caveat... unless he's gone
full williamsburg

60
00:01:54,382 --> 00:01:57,083
and trained his moustache
into a Salvador Dali.

61
00:01:57,084 --> 00:01:59,895
Then I'm gonna have
to reevaluate.

62
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:02,520
I wonder what those
look like in the morning.

[Groaning]

65
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:18,580
Accuracy below limit.

66
00:02:18,581 --> 00:02:21,833
Ugh, damn it.
Come on.

67
00:02:21,834 --> 00:02:23,251
Fail.

68
00:02:23,252 --> 00:02:26,588
Ugh.

[Cell phone vibrating]

70
00:02:30,927 --> 00:02:31,968
JB?

71
00:02:31,969 --> 00:02:33,428
Hello?

72
00:02:33,429 --> 00:02:34,930
Hi, Jason,
I have JB for you.

73
00:02:34,931 --> 00:02:37,182
Wow, you guys finally got a phone
that can transfer calls.

74
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,727
All right, Jason, you're on
the line with JB brown.

75
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:43,688
Not JB brown.
The "B" is the "brown."

76
00:02:43,689 --> 00:02:44,898
Jesus, Roger.

77
00:02:44,899 --> 00:02:46,666
Give it to me.

78
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:50,237
Hey, good news, Jay.
Mama dog has a bone for you.

79
00:02:50,238 --> 00:02:53,139
A week-long role
that you would be perfect for.

80
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,908
Role? Like,
an acting job?

81
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:59,546
Yes, perfect for a young,
average weight, average height,

82
00:02:59,547 --> 00:03:01,498
vaguely unimpressive
guy like you.

83
00:03:01,499 --> 00:03:04,251
$500 for the week,
and it starts this afternoon.

84
00:03:04,252 --> 00:03:06,753
- Are you interested?
- Yeah, totally.

85
00:03:06,754 --> 00:03:09,840
- You had me at $500.
- Fantastic.

86
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,629
So now I have everything
for my champagne punch.

87
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,130
The secret is
the orange zest.

88
00:03:17,131 --> 00:03:18,698
Great, and I have
everything I need

89
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:19,966
to make my vodka
gummy worms.

90
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:21,401
The secret is
they get you wasted.

91
00:03:21,402 --> 00:03:23,169
Really? Vodka worms?

92
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,771
I mean, this is our
first party as a couple.

93
00:03:24,772 --> 00:03:27,807
I was thinking cheese plates,
my punch...

94
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:29,484
People falling asleep
in flutes of your punch.

95
00:03:29,485 --> 00:03:31,678
"Classy cocktail"
is code for boring.

96
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:32,946
Our first party
should be a banger.

97
00:03:32,947 --> 00:03:35,382
Got a DJ app on my iPad,
we'll get a keg...

98
00:03:35,383 --> 00:03:38,685
A keg? Are the pledges
gonna tap it?

99
00:03:38,686 --> 00:03:40,387
We're having
a cocktail party.

100
00:03:40,388 --> 00:03:42,222
Shouldn't our first party
as a couple

101
00:03:42,223 --> 00:03:44,391
have stuff
we both like?

102
00:03:44,392 --> 00:03:45,492
You're right.

103
00:03:45,493 --> 00:03:47,494
We'll do this
my way and your way.

104
00:03:47,495 --> 00:03:48,762
It'll be the best
of both of us,

105
00:03:48,763 --> 00:03:52,841
instead of just,
you know, the best.

106
00:03:52,842 --> 00:03:55,769
Why do I always get Turkey?
I'm so bored of Turkey.

107
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,304
- What'd you get?
- Turkey.

108
00:03:57,305 --> 00:04:00,106
So it's happening. Today.
I'm gonna go surprise Brett

109
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:02,142
- at his weekly shuffleboard game.
- Wow.

110
00:04:02,143 --> 00:04:04,144
That's so
rom-com of you.

111
00:04:04,145 --> 00:04:05,512
Is there a way you can
make sure it's raining

112
00:04:05,513 --> 00:04:06,980
when you run
to each other and kiss?

113
00:04:06,981 --> 00:04:10,050
I know, but it'll
be exciting, you know?

114
00:04:10,051 --> 00:04:12,185
He'll be like,
"whoa, Tina."

115
00:04:12,186 --> 00:04:14,788
And I'll be like,
"hey, Brett, I missed you."

116
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:16,364
Only not in those words,
'cause I have dignity.

117
00:04:16,365 --> 00:04:18,742
- Do I look okay?
- Yeah.

118
00:04:18,743 --> 00:04:21,027
You look great.
Cute, sweet,

119
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:22,829
but willing
to do the weird stuff.

120
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,264
Thanks.

121
00:04:24,265 --> 00:04:25,498
I'm a little nervous.

122
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:27,626
So what about you?
What's up with your gig?

123
00:04:27,627 --> 00:04:29,836
I don't know much.
JB cast me in something.

124
00:04:29,837 --> 00:04:32,672
It starts this afternoon,
I'd get $500 for it.

125
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:34,708
I'm trying to figure out
what I'd cast you as.

126
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:37,944
Young lesbian coming to terms
with her sexuality,

127
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:40,013
or corpse #2
in a zombie film.

128
00:04:40,014 --> 00:04:41,414
Hey, I'm corpse
#1 material,

129
00:04:41,415 --> 00:04:43,950
but I don't care what it is.
I got a job.

130
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:45,585
I'm so happy,
I could kiss JB

131
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:46,937
right on the tip
of the penis.

132
00:04:46,938 --> 00:04:50,590
Welcome to day one of five,
my foodie thespians.

133
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:52,425
Now your job is
to hit the streets,

134
00:04:52,426 --> 00:04:54,611
and  out
restaurant week flyers.

135
00:04:54,612 --> 00:04:56,571
I want you bastards
to be friendly.

136
00:04:56,572 --> 00:05:00,166
No one wants a flyer from a taco
acting like a turd.

137
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:01,451
Yeah, I'm talking
to you, Joan.

138
00:05:01,452 --> 00:05:03,787
You got an attitude problem.
Adjust it.

139
00:05:03,788 --> 00:05:07,073
Remember, you are responsible
for your own costumes.

140
00:05:07,074 --> 00:05:09,000
Ruin them,
and I dock your pay.

141
00:05:09,001 --> 00:05:11,144
Okay, big smiles.

142
00:05:11,145 --> 00:05:13,346
Aren't you glad you decided
to blow off law school

143
00:05:13,347 --> 00:05:15,256
and become an actor?

144
00:05:15,257 --> 00:05:16,983
So, uh, have you
done this before?

145
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:18,518
Yep. A lot of us

146
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:20,987
work the flyering circuit
pretty regularly.

147
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:23,156
I've been a hammer,
a cell phone...

148
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:24,474
Once I was a tampon.

149
00:05:24,475 --> 00:05:26,101
- Ew.
- It was okay.

150
00:05:26,102 --> 00:05:29,562
It rained.
I absorbed it.

151
00:05:29,563 --> 00:05:31,690
Hey, wanna bake
your cake later?

152
00:05:31,691 --> 00:05:33,149
Makes the day fly by.

153
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:35,168
So I guess any guy
in a food costume will do,

154
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:36,936
- is that it?
- Don't talk to me, Jimmy.

155
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:38,070
Let's keep
this professional.

156
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:48,199
Come on, Brett.

157
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,290
Boom!

158
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:53,670
Nice shot.

159
00:06:09,587 --> 00:06:11,389
Oh, sweet.

160
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:13,191
My old strobe light.

161
00:06:13,192 --> 00:06:14,592
Now it's a party.

162
00:06:14,593 --> 00:06:16,401
Sweet, a seizure party.

163
00:06:16,402 --> 00:06:18,945
- Check out what I got.
- You...

164
00:06:18,946 --> 00:06:20,113
Bought a bag
of severed hands?

165
00:06:20,114 --> 00:06:22,115
They're vintage
and artistic.

166
00:06:22,116 --> 00:06:23,283
The guy at the flea

167
00:06:23,284 --> 00:06:25,285
says it's really trendy
to use them as bowls.

168
00:06:25,286 --> 00:06:26,571
I guess we can use
these trendy hands

169
00:06:26,572 --> 00:06:27,829
to hold my guacamole.

170
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,540
We're serving guacamole?
I was thinking more

171
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:32,834
- cheeses and crudite.
- Listen...

172
00:06:32,835 --> 00:06:34,079
If we're putting out
your hands,

173
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,545
they're gonna
be holding my guac.

174
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:39,174
That sounded dirtier
than I meant it.

175
00:06:39,175 --> 00:06:40,800
I'm gonna go shower.

176
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:42,635
Need a hand?

177
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:44,556
Check out
restaurant week.

178
00:06:44,557 --> 00:06:45,991
Check out
restaurant week?

179
00:06:45,992 --> 00:06:47,057
Check out
restaurant week?

180
00:06:47,058 --> 00:06:48,725
Check out
restaurant week?

181
00:06:48,726 --> 00:06:50,727
Check out
restaurant week.

182
00:06:50,728 --> 00:06:53,098
Get a job, dude.

183
00:06:53,099 --> 00:06:54,432
This is my job.

184
00:06:54,433 --> 00:06:58,359
- Check out restaurant week.
- Thank you.

185
00:06:59,835 --> 00:07:02,530
Jane.

186
00:07:02,531 --> 00:07:03,948
Jason?

187
00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:06,777
- Hey.
- Excuse me.

188
00:07:10,387 --> 00:07:13,500
It's, uh...
It's good to see you.

189
00:07:13,501 --> 00:07:15,543
You too.

190
00:07:15,544 --> 00:07:18,254
So, um, what's
going on here?

191
00:07:18,255 --> 00:07:20,926
I know what
you're thinking:

192
00:07:20,927 --> 00:07:22,394
Why didn't I tell you
when we first met

193
00:07:22,395 --> 00:07:23,676
that I was
an undercover cop?

194
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:25,428
[Laughing]
Nice disguise.

195
00:07:25,429 --> 00:07:26,598
Easy, easy.

196
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:28,181
- You might blow my cover.
- Oh.

197
00:07:28,182 --> 00:07:29,701
Are you on
a stake-out?

198
00:07:29,702 --> 00:07:31,684
Trying to take down
a corrupt muffin?

199
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:34,395
Yeah, it's the tip of
a massive illegal pastry ring.

200
00:07:34,396 --> 00:07:35,522
[Laughing]

201
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:38,024
Actually...

202
00:07:38,025 --> 00:07:40,345
There's something I'd kind of
like to know, so...

203
00:07:40,346 --> 00:07:43,988
That morning,
at my house, you...

204
00:07:43,989 --> 00:07:45,532
Uh, you...

205
00:07:45,533 --> 00:07:46,885
Hey, I got a coffee.

206
00:07:46,886 --> 00:07:47,992
We should go
to the meeting.

207
00:07:47,993 --> 00:07:50,787
Oh, Jason, this is
my coworker grant.

208
00:07:50,788 --> 00:07:52,557
Oh, uh, sorry, hi.

209
00:07:52,558 --> 00:07:54,332
I didn't realize you were
talking to a friend.

210
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:55,959
I've never met
a professional cake before.

211
00:07:57,434 --> 00:07:59,003
Is this, like,
what you do?

212
00:07:59,004 --> 00:08:01,923
Oh, no, no.
I don't do this...

213
00:08:01,924 --> 00:08:04,970
I mean, right now, yes,
I do do this.

214
00:08:04,971 --> 00:08:06,271
I've done other things.

215
00:08:06,272 --> 00:08:07,971
I was an
assistant before.

216
00:08:07,972 --> 00:08:10,275
Not that that's
necessarily higher

217
00:08:10,276 --> 00:08:11,943
on the evolutionary
chart, uh...

218
00:08:11,944 --> 00:08:14,646
I'm just sort of in a
transition phase, you know?

219
00:08:14,647 --> 00:08:16,615
The recession and all
has sort of messed with

220
00:08:16,616 --> 00:08:18,439
my five-year,
uh, plan, and...

221
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,985
This is, um...

222
00:08:21,986 --> 00:08:27,240
This is, you know...
It's like a... temp thang.

223
00:08:29,508 --> 00:08:31,578
Cool. So, uh...

224
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:32,998
We should probably
go to that meeting.

225
00:08:32,999 --> 00:08:36,332
- We're gonna be late for the 5:30...
- Yes, right, shoot, um...

226
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:39,365
Sorry, I gotta run.
Bye, Jason.

227
00:08:39,366 --> 00:08:40,503
Oh, okay.

228
00:08:40,504 --> 00:08:42,839
Uh, bye... Jane.

229
00:08:52,417 --> 00:08:54,767
What was up
with that?

230
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:57,562
I'm ready
to bake my cake now.

231
00:08:59,991 --> 00:09:02,027
Damn it, Jay,
answer your phone.

232
00:09:02,028 --> 00:09:03,860
What is wrong
with you?

233
00:09:03,861 --> 00:09:07,466
Hey, your eyes
look sad.

234
00:09:07,467 --> 00:09:09,000
Not red and squinty
from drugs sad,

235
00:09:09,001 --> 00:09:10,033
but emotion sad.

236
00:09:10,034 --> 00:09:11,636
Like I'm gonna
tell you my problems

237
00:09:11,637 --> 00:09:12,827
so you can
call me a whore.

238
00:09:12,828 --> 00:09:18,166
Come here.

239
00:09:18,167 --> 00:09:20,543
I call this
forgetting juice.

240
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:28,885
Thanks.

241
00:09:28,886 --> 00:09:31,095
For what?

242
00:09:31,096 --> 00:09:33,431
Get it?
Forgetting juice.

243
00:09:33,432 --> 00:09:34,724
[Chuckling]

244
00:09:36,241 --> 00:09:37,829
Here, I've had enough.

245
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:39,229
Yeah, I want
more than enough.

246
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:41,314
I knew I'd
find you here.

247
00:09:41,315 --> 00:09:43,483
I can't believe you brought
another guy to our spot.

248
00:09:43,484 --> 00:09:45,170
Nothing's going on, Jimmy.

249
00:09:45,171 --> 00:09:46,903
Not that it's any of your
business, because we're over.

250
00:09:46,904 --> 00:09:49,822
Watch your ass, man.

251
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:52,944
God, I think
I smoked too much.

252
00:09:52,945 --> 00:09:54,446
My heart's beating
like a hummingbird's.

253
00:09:54,447 --> 00:09:56,412
Yeah, sometimes my brother
puts extra stuff in there.

254
00:09:56,413 --> 00:09:58,665
Salvia, ketamine,
cat tranqs.

255
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,959
Our shift's almost over.
Come on.

256
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,710
A drink will
mellow you out.

257
00:10:02,711 --> 00:10:05,957
Alcohol isn't helping.
I feel weirder.

258
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:07,459
Just roll with it.

259
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,466
I'm gonna go
to the bathroom.

260
00:10:08,467 --> 00:10:10,677
I don'think
I can roll.

261
00:10:10,678 --> 00:10:13,137
Geometrically impossible.

262
00:10:13,138 --> 00:10:15,934
I had a Brett once.

263
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:19,437
Her name was Shyamala.
Our love was hot.

264
00:10:19,438 --> 00:10:22,814
We used to do it everywhere.
Like sex rabbits.

265
00:10:22,815 --> 00:10:24,509
And she told me
I was the one.

266
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:25,977
But I must have been
one of many

267
00:10:25,978 --> 00:10:29,581
because I caught her
with my friend Johnny Gupta

268
00:10:29,582 --> 00:10:31,349
up in her big bosom.

269
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:32,824
All up in them.

270
00:10:32,825 --> 00:10:34,920
- Oh, that sucks.
- I know.

271
00:10:34,921 --> 00:10:37,622
[Phone ringing]

272
00:10:37,623 --> 00:10:39,122
Jay, finally.

273
00:10:39,123 --> 00:10:41,193
Teen, I'm
really wasted,

274
00:10:41,194 --> 00:10:43,728
and I saw Jane, who thinks
I'm a piece of crap

275
00:10:43,729 --> 00:10:45,128
because I'm
a piece of cake.

276
00:10:45,129 --> 00:10:47,098
Slow down.
You saw Jane?

277
00:10:47,099 --> 00:10:48,172
What happened?

278
00:10:48,173 --> 00:10:49,601
Well, I didn't
sweep her off her feet

279
00:10:49,602 --> 00:10:50,969
to go live
under a rainbow.

280
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:53,553
- God, I am such an idiot.
- Just breathe.

281
00:10:53,554 --> 00:10:54,887
Where are you?

282
00:10:54,888 --> 00:10:56,842
E coaster says
windfall pub.

283
00:10:56,843 --> 00:11:00,518
- So... windfall pub.
- Okay, I'm on my way.

284
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:03,938
Just drink a lot of water
and, uh, think happy thoughts.

285
00:11:03,939 --> 00:11:05,951
Oh, and do not look
at your hands.

286
00:11:05,952 --> 00:11:07,519
It freaks you out
when you're high.

287
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,268
Okay. Bye.

288
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:11,779
Ugh.

289
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,489
I've got to go.

290
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:16,200
Hey, how did you
get over Shyamala?

291
00:11:16,201 --> 00:11:18,563
I give Johnny Gupta
food poisoning.

292
00:11:18,564 --> 00:11:19,564
Really?

293
00:11:19,565 --> 00:11:23,541
No, no,
I would never...

294
00:11:23,542 --> 00:11:24,970
[Laughing]

295
00:11:24,971 --> 00:11:27,170
- Thanks, Bobby.
- You're welcome, Tina.

296
00:11:27,171 --> 00:11:30,214
I mean, whore friend
of Jason.

297
00:11:32,232 --> 00:11:35,647
Okay, music is on,

298
00:11:35,648 --> 00:11:37,182
guac's in the hands,

299
00:11:37,183 --> 00:11:38,416
punch is out.

300
00:11:38,417 --> 00:11:39,885
Can I just take
this entire lighting scheme

301
00:11:39,886 --> 00:11:42,894
from boring...
To awesome?

302
00:11:46,663 --> 00:11:50,777
Okay, this is... bad.
Like we have a secret room

303
00:11:50,778 --> 00:11:53,818
where we cage humans
and harvest their skin bad.

304
00:11:53,819 --> 00:11:56,955
Okay, don't panic.
We can still save this.

305
00:11:56,956 --> 00:11:59,757
We'll just go back
to our regular lighting

306
00:11:59,758 --> 00:12:01,592
and put the keg
in the hallway.

307
00:12:01,593 --> 00:12:02,830
I was talking
about your creepy hands,

308
00:12:02,831 --> 00:12:04,228
and I don't get it.

309
00:12:04,229 --> 00:12:05,792
You don't even listen
to this enya-type stuff.

310
00:12:05,793 --> 00:12:07,365
Sometimes I do.

311
00:12:07,366 --> 00:12:08,544
- [Snickering]
- Okay, fine, I don't.

312
00:12:08,545 --> 00:12:09,734
But what about you?

313
00:12:09,735 --> 00:12:11,069
When we went
to my cousin's

314
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:12,437
birthday party
at Rutgers last month,

315
00:12:12,438 --> 00:12:14,272
it was exactly like the party
you're trying to throw,

316
00:12:14,273 --> 00:12:16,474
and you kept complaining
that you were too old for this.

317
00:12:16,475 --> 00:12:18,096
Fine, listen,
you're right, but sometimes...

318
00:12:18,097 --> 00:12:20,890
I just wanna show people
that we still know how to party.

319
00:12:20,891 --> 00:12:25,216
I want to show people that
we've moved past <i>just</i> partying.

320
00:12:25,217 --> 00:12:26,551
But I don't know
why I thought

321
00:12:26,552 --> 00:12:29,190
that involved
punch and easy listening.

322
00:12:29,191 --> 00:12:32,235
Look, we're gonna throw
tons of parties, all right?

323
00:12:32,236 --> 00:12:34,570
So tonight, we'll show everyone
how mature we are.

324
00:12:34,571 --> 00:12:37,195
And at our next party,
we'll prove to everyone

325
00:12:37,196 --> 00:12:38,282
that we can
still throw down.

326
00:12:38,283 --> 00:12:39,826
Sounds great.

327
00:12:39,827 --> 00:12:41,299
But I'm in charge
of the music.

328
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,533
And no hands.

329
00:12:42,534 --> 00:12:44,205
- The hands must go.
- Okay.

330
00:12:44,206 --> 00:12:46,290
- Up top.
- Yeah.

331
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:49,474
You're dehydrated.
This'll make you feel better.

332
00:12:49,475 --> 00:12:51,742
Yeah, well, maybe
this'll make <i>you</i> feel better.

333
00:12:53,085 --> 00:12:54,257
No, thank you.

334
00:12:54,258 --> 00:12:55,883
Sorry, I misread that.

335
00:12:55,884 --> 00:12:57,593
Thought you
were feeling me.

336
00:12:57,594 --> 00:13:00,785
You wanna just
thumb-wrestle instead?

337
00:13:00,786 --> 00:13:03,349
Whoa, Jay, nice look.

338
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,555
Are you too depressed
for me to mock

339
00:13:04,556 --> 00:13:06,727
the full Betty Crocker,
or can I go for it?

340
00:13:06,728 --> 00:13:08,271
Tina.

341
00:13:08,272 --> 00:13:10,440
Uh, pull it
together, Jay.

342
00:13:10,441 --> 00:13:12,363
Man, I thought
I was messed up.

343
00:13:12,364 --> 00:13:14,277
You saw Jane like this?

344
00:13:14,278 --> 00:13:16,267
I don't wanna
talk about Jane.

345
00:13:16,268 --> 00:13:19,574
This is corn, she's so nice.
I really like her,

346
00:13:19,575 --> 00:13:22,243
which is weird,
'cause usually I hate corn.

347
00:13:22,244 --> 00:13:24,242
You know
who I hate? Brett.

348
00:13:24,243 --> 00:13:27,345
He was basically dry-humping
some shuffleboard slut

349
00:13:27,346 --> 00:13:29,333
when I showed up.
It was brutal, Jay.

350
00:13:29,334 --> 00:13:31,215
That's horrible.

351
00:13:31,216 --> 00:13:33,463
Oh, my God, the world
is a horrible place.

352
00:13:33,464 --> 00:13:35,920
This place is
a horrible place.

353
00:13:35,921 --> 00:13:37,955
Let's get out of here and go
to Stacey and Eric's party.

354
00:13:37,956 --> 00:13:39,135
- Aww.
- Hey, C, you wanna come?

355
00:13:39,136 --> 00:13:40,720
Really? You still
wanna go to that?

356
00:13:40,721 --> 00:13:42,927
The idea of being around
happy couples right now

357
00:13:42,928 --> 00:13:44,629
makes me feel like
I wanna shave my head

358
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,350
and fashion my hair
into a noose.

359
00:13:46,351 --> 00:13:48,666
Hey! Sully just told me
you kissed my girl.

360
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:50,855
You and me.
Outside. Now.

361
00:13:50,856 --> 00:13:53,304
- Jimmy, no.
- Shut up.

362
00:13:53,305 --> 00:13:54,439
Hey, don't talk
to her like that.

363
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,740
Mind your
business, bitch.

364
00:13:55,741 --> 00:13:57,708
Hey, don't talk
to <i>her</i> like that.

365
00:13:57,709 --> 00:14:01,012
Yeah, whose got your back?
Cake guy does.

366
00:14:01,013 --> 00:14:02,346
[General gasps]

367
00:14:02,347 --> 00:14:03,548
Jimmy.

368
00:14:03,549 --> 00:14:06,049
- You're an animal.
- [Lascivious snicker]

369
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:11,375
- Jay, are you okay?
- Oh!

370
00:14:11,376 --> 00:14:13,857
Ooh.

371
00:14:17,052 --> 00:14:18,424
- [Whimpering]
- What hurts?

372
00:14:18,425 --> 00:14:21,552
My wallet.
The costume's ruined,

373
00:14:21,553 --> 00:14:23,346
JB's gonna make me
pay for it.

374
00:14:23,347 --> 00:14:26,194
I can't pay for it,
not with money.

375
00:14:26,195 --> 00:14:28,601
Okay, we should go
to Stacey and Eric's.

376
00:14:28,602 --> 00:14:31,166
If anybody can get a stain
out of synthetic fabric,

377
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:33,648
it's Eric.

378
00:14:33,649 --> 00:14:36,505
How much does
my party rock?

379
00:14:36,506 --> 00:14:39,641
So much. I-I feel
like I'm on Jay-Z's yacht.

380
00:14:39,642 --> 00:14:41,697
- I'm gonna go mingle.
- Mingle.

381
00:14:41,698 --> 00:14:43,783
Uh, hey, lench.

382
00:14:43,784 --> 00:14:46,048
- Great party, doctor.
- Thank you, sir.

383
00:14:46,049 --> 00:14:48,454
So, uh, any single girls
here for me,

384
00:14:48,455 --> 00:14:50,873
or anyone here
into the lifestyle?

385
00:14:50,874 --> 00:14:52,667
- Uh, what... what lifestyle?
- You know.

386
00:14:52,668 --> 00:14:55,795
Sharing and caring.
No rules, no hang-ups.

387
00:14:55,796 --> 00:14:57,171
- I don't think so, lench.
- Come on.

388
00:14:57,172 --> 00:14:59,061
We can talk
like men, man.

389
00:14:59,062 --> 00:15:01,509
Don't make it weird just because
I used to date Stace.

390
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,302
In fact, we can talk
about that, if you want to.

391
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:04,554
I have stories.

392
00:15:04,555 --> 00:15:06,368
Uh, yes, she told me the one
about the baby carrots.

393
00:15:06,369 --> 00:15:07,469
She told you that?

394
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:08,849
Well, look, you think that
embarrasses me?

395
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:10,906
That doesn't embarrass me.
I'm proud of that.

396
00:15:10,907 --> 00:15:12,340
There's, like,
five people on earth

397
00:15:12,341 --> 00:15:14,480
that can peel a carrot that way.
[Doorbell ringing]

398
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:16,315
I gotta, uh, get this.

399
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,736
- Hey, uh...
- Where are your soaps?

400
00:15:20,737 --> 00:15:24,386
Why are you a cake?

401
00:15:24,387 --> 00:15:25,620
What the hell
is wrong with Jason?

402
00:15:25,621 --> 00:15:28,828
Stacey, you look
really pretty.

403
00:15:28,829 --> 00:15:31,493
I might kiss
your pretty little wife.

404
00:15:31,494 --> 00:15:33,161
You know, Brett
kisses other girls,

405
00:15:33,162 --> 00:15:35,530
so maybe I should
try it, right?

406
00:15:35,531 --> 00:15:37,753
Ass-head hipster idiot.

407
00:15:37,754 --> 00:15:40,590
Hey, punch!

408
00:15:55,717 --> 00:15:59,108
Tina. I thought
I smelled sassy.

409
00:15:59,109 --> 00:16:00,822
Lench, I will
cut out your retina

410
00:16:00,823 --> 00:16:03,404
with the jagged lid from a can
of soup, I swear to God.

411
00:16:03,405 --> 00:16:05,573
Relax, I'm just
being friendly.

412
00:16:05,574 --> 00:16:08,395
Be friendly from at... at least
three feet away from me.

413
00:16:11,967 --> 00:16:16,138
Tina, so you...

414
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:17,268
I'll catch up later.

415
00:16:22,939 --> 00:16:24,133
Hands! Hands!

416
00:16:24,134 --> 00:16:27,282
Stace!

417
00:16:27,283 --> 00:16:29,430
Stace!

418
00:16:29,431 --> 00:16:31,974
[Laughter and murmurs]

419
00:16:31,975 --> 00:16:34,101
Uh, I-I-I...

420
00:16:34,102 --> 00:16:36,057
I couldn't get the stains
out of my costume

421
00:16:36,058 --> 00:16:39,248
'cause of
the tub of hands.

422
00:16:42,964 --> 00:16:45,254
Um...

423
00:16:49,838 --> 00:16:53,742
I'm gonna
make a toast.

424
00:16:53,743 --> 00:16:55,289
To Stacey and Eric.

425
00:16:55,678 --> 00:16:57,917
You two have it
all figured out, I mean...

426
00:16:57,918 --> 00:17:01,883
You're in love,
you know what you want.

427
00:17:01,884 --> 00:17:03,285
How do you know?
I have no idea.

428
00:17:03,286 --> 00:17:05,821
Uh, okay, uh, Jay,
I-I think that...

429
00:17:05,822 --> 00:17:07,259
No, Eric, no.

430
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:12,765
See most of us, we don't
just get to figure it all out.

431
00:17:12,766 --> 00:17:15,518
Get a cool job,

432
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,998
meet a girl who poops
chocolate ice cream.

433
00:17:19,167 --> 00:17:22,971
Some of us are the losers
of our friends.

434
00:17:22,972 --> 00:17:25,945
That's me, in case
you were wondering.

435
00:17:25,946 --> 00:17:28,739
We think we're
corpse #1 material but...

436
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:32,243
Maybe we're only
cut out to be cake.

437
00:17:32,244 --> 00:17:33,994
Point is...

438
00:17:33,995 --> 00:17:37,164
The point is...

439
00:17:38,765 --> 00:17:41,088
Tina you're... making me lose
my train of thought.

440
00:17:44,492 --> 00:17:46,027
Somebody should
videotape this.

441
00:17:46,028 --> 00:17:47,062
I mean, it's
just soft stuff,

442
00:17:47,063 --> 00:17:50,765
but as kissing vids go,
this is golden.

443
00:17:50,766 --> 00:17:53,634
More tongue.

444
00:17:57,171 --> 00:17:59,440
Tina.

445
00:17:59,441 --> 00:18:01,021
- Tina?
- Uh...

446
00:18:01,022 --> 00:18:03,607
'Ugh. Advil.

447
00:18:03,608 --> 00:18:05,901
My mouth
tastes like pennies.

448
00:18:05,902 --> 00:18:07,782
Hey, you guys.

449
00:18:07,783 --> 00:18:10,072
- Good morning.
- [Evil laugh]

450
00:18:10,073 --> 00:18:11,586
Before you guys yell,

451
00:18:11,587 --> 00:18:14,455
and you have every right
to be mad at us,

452
00:18:14,456 --> 00:18:17,959
but maybe you could
just write, like, an email

453
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,375
with a lot of exclamation marks
instead, 'cause...

454
00:18:21,376 --> 00:18:22,830
A loud noise
could kill me right now.

455
00:18:22,831 --> 00:18:24,765
Did we totally
ruin your party?

456
00:18:24,766 --> 00:18:26,567
Oh, doesn't matter.
Next one's an Eric party.

457
00:18:26,568 --> 00:18:28,236
It'll more than
make up for it.

458
00:18:28,237 --> 00:18:29,425
No, it's fine.

459
00:18:29,426 --> 00:18:31,839
Half my law school friends
took undie pics of you,

460
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,345
and posted them
on... everywhere,

461
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:35,598
so everyone
still had a good time.

462
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:37,600
So, teen, lench
your boyfriend now?

463
00:18:37,601 --> 00:18:39,013
If I wasn't
so hung-over,

464
00:18:39,014 --> 00:18:42,083
I'd say something witty
about your manjamas, but...

465
00:18:42,084 --> 00:18:44,899
I am, so I'm just
gonna go pee.

466
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,984
Ugh...

467
00:18:48,055 --> 00:18:49,695
[Groans]
No!

468
00:18:49,696 --> 00:18:51,197
Oh, good,
you're here.

469
00:18:51,198 --> 00:18:53,928
Listen, I know we kind of
hooked up last night,

470
00:18:53,929 --> 00:18:56,285
but I can't really be
in a relationship right now.

471
00:18:56,286 --> 00:18:58,078
I respect you enough
to tell you...

472
00:18:58,079 --> 00:18:59,830
Get out of here,
I have to pee.

473
00:18:59,831 --> 00:19:03,042
Oh, I'm good.
It's cool, I won't look.

474
00:19:03,043 --> 00:19:08,214
Ugh. Oh, God.

475
00:19:08,215 --> 00:19:10,711
I might look.
Just being honest.

476
00:19:10,712 --> 00:19:12,468
I respect you enough
to be honest with you

477
00:19:12,469 --> 00:19:14,715
about looking
at you pee maybe...

478
00:19:14,716 --> 00:19:16,722
If you...
It'd be... whoa!

479
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:25,860
Oh, who sent me
the sad stripper?

480
00:19:25,861 --> 00:19:27,562
You know, you're supposed
to jump out of the cake,

481
00:19:27,563 --> 00:19:29,363
- not carry it.
- I ruined the costume.

482
00:19:29,364 --> 00:19:30,898
I'm sorry,
I will pay for it.

483
00:19:30,899 --> 00:19:32,154
I don't know how.
I may be...

484
00:19:32,155 --> 00:19:34,602
Sending you installments
from the lemonade stand I set up

485
00:19:34,603 --> 00:19:37,451
outside my parents' place,
but somehow, I will pay.

486
00:19:37,452 --> 00:19:39,829
I knew you'd come begging
for your job back.

487
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,809
Huh? No, no, no,
I'm not...

488
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:43,123
Because if
what you're doing,

489
00:19:43,124 --> 00:19:45,880
if it counts as begging,

490
00:19:45,881 --> 00:19:48,295
then yes, you can have
your job back.

491
00:19:48,296 --> 00:19:51,465
Yes.

492
00:19:51,466 --> 00:19:53,454
Yes, I am,
I'm begging

493
00:19:53,455 --> 00:19:55,427
- for my job back.
- Then say please.

494
00:19:55,428 --> 00:20:00,599
Say, "please, I beg you, JB,
sweet, merciful God of thunder."

495
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,184
Please?

496
00:20:04,452 --> 00:20:06,564
All right.
Come to mama.

497
00:20:06,565 --> 00:20:09,066
- [Chuckling]
- Oh.

498
00:20:09,067 --> 00:20:10,943
So you...
You fired Roger.

499
00:20:10,944 --> 00:20:12,173
No, he quit.

500
00:20:12,174 --> 00:20:13,988
Something about
a hostile work environment.

501
00:20:13,989 --> 00:20:14,989
Oh.

502
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:18,325
Welcome home, puppy dog.
Welcome home.

503
00:20:18,326 --> 00:20:21,136
