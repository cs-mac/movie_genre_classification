1
00:00:28,095 --> 00:00:31,330
Yes. Uh-huh.
I'm not kidding.

2
00:00:31,332 --> 00:00:34,199
That's where this "class act"
brought me.

3
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:37,503
Yeah, you heard me.
Hooters.

4
00:00:37,505 --> 00:00:41,473
This is the first date
I've been on since the divorce,

5
00:00:41,475 --> 00:00:44,309
and the guy brings me
to a Hooters.

6
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:46,378
Is Tyler asleep?

7
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,548
Whoa! Oh, yeah! Whoo!

8
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:50,783
Not all the way.

9
00:00:50,785 --> 00:00:52,017
What's he doing?
Yeah!

10
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:54,853
♪ This t-shirt's
on fire! ♪

11
00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:56,655
Why is he singing that?

12
00:00:56,657 --> 00:00:59,491
Must save planet earth.

13
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:02,461
No, it's all good.

14
00:01:02,463 --> 00:01:04,296
It's out.
What's out?!

15
00:01:04,298 --> 00:01:05,864
Oh, God, I'm coming home.

16
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:07,199
Intruder alert.

17
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:15,007
Yeah, maybe that's
not actually a bad idea.

18
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:16,241
Okay, here's the plan.

19
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:17,810
You're gonna call me
in 10 minutes

20
00:01:17,812 --> 00:01:21,146
so that I can tell this dope
I have an emergency.

21
00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:23,849
Can you
give me my bath now?

22
00:01:23,851 --> 00:01:26,518
Make it five minutes.

Got you, uh, buffalo shrimp
with the sauce on the side.

30
00:02:01,889 --> 00:02:03,455
They'll do that
for me here.

31
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,190
I didn't know
how you took it, so...

32
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:08,127
You realize that
you're not actually

33
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:10,529
looking at my face
right now.

34
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:13,098
Very tight game goin' on up
there. I don't wanna miss it.

35
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,933
<i>Well, I know you</i>
<i>really gotta swing the axe hard</i>

36
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:17,736
<i>to get those, uh, hits in deep</i>
<i>on this quick turn.</i>

37
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:19,104
Hi, Jim.

38
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:21,273
- Hey, Jim.
- Hey, Jim.

39
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:24,143
Cheese sticks
in the shape of a heart.

40
00:02:24,145 --> 00:02:26,879
From me, bunny, Bethany,
and Britney.

41
00:02:26,881 --> 00:02:29,948
Thank you, bubbles.
That's very nice.

42
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,850
Bye.
Have fun.
See ya.

43
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:33,519
All right.

44
00:02:33,521 --> 00:02:37,222
Hey, I noticed that you made
eye contact with boobles,

45
00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:38,657
but I'm... I mean,
I'm not sure it was her eyes

46
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:39,925
you were looking at.

47
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,697
So...

48
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:50,035
You... Organize closets
for a living.

49
00:02:50,037 --> 00:02:52,304
Yes.
Is it hard to find people

50
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:54,806
who can't organize
their own closets?

51
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:56,241
How does that work?

52
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:58,677
Well, it's not that they can't
do it for themselves.

53
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,512
It's that they don't
have the time

54
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,080
or they don't do it
efficiently.

55
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:05,350
Did you start with organizing
glove compartments

56
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:07,419
and just work your way up
from there, or...?

57
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:13,192
Listen, I'm sorry.
I know this is not going well.

58
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:14,593
I, uh...

59
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:17,496
I haven't been on a date
in 20 years.

60
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:22,601
I haven't been on a date
since senior year.

61
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:24,736
You get married in college?

62
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:26,004
Yep.

63
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:27,506
Me too.

64
00:03:27,508 --> 00:03:29,341
Really?
Yes.

65
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:31,577
Is this not the weirdest feeling
in the world right now?

66
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:35,514
Like weird Al
starring in "weird science."

67
00:03:35,516 --> 00:03:38,050
Yes.
I like that.

68
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:39,351
You just came up
with that?

69
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:42,888
Yes.
Very good.

70
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:47,593
You know, I think I will have
one of these buffalo shrimp.

71
00:03:47,595 --> 00:03:49,828
And I'll have it
with the sauce.

72
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,396
Excellent.

73
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:57,836
Oh, my God.

74
00:03:57,838 --> 00:03:59,771
Oh, my God.

75
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:00,806
It's hot.

76
00:04:00,808 --> 00:04:03,609
Oh, my God!
Who makes sauce this hot?!

77
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:06,178
I just...
did you drink my beer?!

78
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,613
No. No, no.
I think you did.

79
00:04:07,615 --> 00:04:11,583
Boobles! Buddy! Britney!
Can you get me some water?!

80
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,652
Here. Have
some French onion soup.

81
00:04:20,194 --> 00:04:22,060
You know... I'm curious.

82
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:24,529
With so many
possible reasons,

83
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:28,267
which one's the one
your wife left you for?

84
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:31,637
Cancer.

85
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:38,043
I'm sorry.

86
00:04:38,045 --> 00:04:43,882
I...Naturally just assumed
you were divorced.

87
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:45,851
It's okay.

88
00:04:45,853 --> 00:04:48,487
I naturally assumed
your husband shot himself,

89
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:50,389
so we're even.

90
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:56,762
I gotta take this.

91
00:04:56,764 --> 00:04:58,230
Hello.

92
00:04:58,232 --> 00:05:00,832
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Calm down!

93
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:04,069
An avalanche?
In our backyard.

94
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:06,471
I'll be home right away.

95
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:09,341
It's an emergency.
I'm sorry.

96
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,878
$20 should cover my half.

97
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,448
He used
the emergency excuse on<i> you?</i>

98
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:19,451
Like<i> he's</i> the one
that had to escape.

99
00:05:19,453 --> 00:05:21,653
Like I'm so horrible.
Huh.

100
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:24,256
Well, everybody has
a bad blind-date story,

101
00:05:24,258 --> 00:05:25,590
and this loser is yours.

102
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:27,392
Who set you up?

103
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:29,561
One of the mothers
in Tyler's class.

104
00:05:29,563 --> 00:05:30,796
Every time I see her,

105
00:05:30,798 --> 00:05:33,198
she tells me
about her "friend Jim."

106
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,634
And "oh, I just have to
meet Jim."

107
00:05:35,636 --> 00:05:37,703
Well, she's a liar
and an idiot.

108
00:05:37,705 --> 00:05:40,372
You should roofie her
and shave her head.

109
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,209
Dick?

110
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:46,545
Hi.

111
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:48,046
No, I can talk.
I'm just at work.

112
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:49,481
Great.

113
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:51,850
I know. I'm so sore.

114
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:57,856
I-I "l" word you, too.

115
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:01,960
Okay.
Talk to you later. Bye.

116
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:07,099
Did you just use
the "l" word with dick?

117
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:08,767
We said it last night.

118
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:12,371
Jen! That's great!
Why didn't you tell me?

119
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:14,005
Oh, you know.

120
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:16,074
I mean, you finally went
on a date, and it was so awful.

121
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:17,876
I didn't want
to make you feel lonelier

122
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:19,578
than you probably
already feel.

123
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,647
No, I'm fine, actually.
And I'm not lonely.

124
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:26,251
I have two wonderful men
in my life, Brendan and Tyler.

125
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:29,554
Brendan needs a girlfriend,
and Tyler needs ritalin.

126
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:31,690
You're suggesting sex
and drugs

127
00:06:31,692 --> 00:06:34,393
as a remedy
for my children's behavior?

128
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:35,794
Oh, my God.

129
00:06:35,796 --> 00:06:38,397
This is the dress
I've been wanting forever!

130
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:39,564
Oh.

131
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,800
What?! No!

132
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:43,402
Who has
that kind of money?

133
00:06:43,404 --> 00:06:44,669
Dick.

134
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:47,339
Try this on.
This is a total milf dress.

135
00:06:47,341 --> 00:06:49,241
We don't try on
the clients' clothes.

136
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:50,642
It's one
of our selling points.

137
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:52,444
"We won't wear
your underwear

138
00:06:52,446 --> 00:06:54,513
while we're organizing
your closets."

139
00:06:54,515 --> 00:06:57,516
I'm just sayin'.
Back to work.

140
00:06:57,518 --> 00:07:00,051
I think right at the bottom
of this rack,

141
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:02,254
we could fit some
more shoes and storage.

142
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:03,388
Jen!

143
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:06,792
Kanye, come
and change the baby.

144
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:07,926
North is wet,

145
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:10,228
and I don't want to drop her
on camera again.

146
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:15,066
Okay, take it off.
No.

147
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:17,836
Look, this whole rack
still has the price tags on.

148
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:20,372
Technically, she hasn't
taken ownership yet.

149
00:07:20,374 --> 00:07:22,040
And besides,
she's at the tennis club.

150
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:23,508
Now, try this on.

151
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:27,045
This dress can change a woman
from the kind a man cheats on

152
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:29,214
to the kind
a man cheats with.

153
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:33,885
I'm gonna go pee.

154
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,993
Expensive. Expensive.

155
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:45,430
Ooh, most expensive.

156
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:55,941
Wow. I didn't know you were
gonna look<i> that</i> good in it.

157
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,877
Oh, honey, what's wrong?

158
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,581
I should have tried harder.

159
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:05,484
I should have
dressed sexier.

160
00:08:05,486 --> 00:08:07,586
You didn't do
anything wrong.

161
00:08:07,588 --> 00:08:08,653
Mark is a pig.

162
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:11,623
But the kids
don't know that.

163
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,959
They just...

164
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:16,561
They want us
to get back together.

165
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:18,697
And I don't know how
to explain it to them.

166
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:20,499
Well, it's time for them
to learn

167
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:22,801
that their dad
is a big pile of crap.

168
00:08:22,803 --> 00:08:24,536
Just... I get so depressed.

169
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:27,138
I-I need to wear
high, sexy heels.

170
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,874
Stop jogging.

171
00:08:28,876 --> 00:08:30,141
It helps.

172
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:31,610
It's freaking me out.

173
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:34,246
Look at me.
I'm ridiculous.

174
00:08:34,248 --> 00:08:35,514
Come here.

175
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:36,715
Come here.

176
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:39,951
Jen's got you.

177
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:42,320
Now I see why they call you
closet queens.

178
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:46,424
Instagram!
Facebook!

179
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:47,926
Yes!
Yes!

180
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:52,898
It was awful, man.
There was no connection at all.

181
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,734
I was so happy when you came up
with the avalanche thing.

182
00:08:55,736 --> 00:08:57,469
That saved my life.

183
00:08:57,471 --> 00:08:58,937
And the way she dressed

184
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:00,872
was like an assistant principal
or something.

185
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,407
I felt like
I was in detention.

186
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:04,476
I got a girl for you.

187
00:09:04,478 --> 00:09:05,677
Yeah?
Blonde lady.

188
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,412
From
my belly-dancing class.

189
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:09,381
A little bit
on the plus size.

190
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:10,916
But when she gets
to moving,

191
00:09:10,918 --> 00:09:13,685
all that flappin'
can make it happen.
No good.

192
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:15,587
That big girl'd hit that Hooters
like a hurricane.

193
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:16,821
Chicken!
Yeah.

194
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:18,490
Steak! Fries!

195
00:09:18,492 --> 00:09:20,091
And a diet coke!

196
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:22,060
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
All right! Gotcha!

197
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:24,029
I'm out, man.
No more dating for me.

198
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:26,398
It's time and money I should be
spending with my kids.

199
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,667
Look who it is.

200
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:30,368
Hey. Larry!

201
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,137
My all-star!
Give me some.

202
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:34,873
It's hilary, dad,
which is bad enough.

203
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,641
You gonna
leave me hangin'?

204
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:39,044
Boom.
Guess what.

205
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:41,212
The new kodiak tents
just arrived.

206
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:42,781
In time for spring break.

207
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:45,784
We're going camping in our
backyard again this year?

208
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:47,385
Why? Are you
too old for that?

209
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:51,089
No. It's just some kids in
my class are going to Florida

210
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,792
or to Colorado
or even Switzerland.

211
00:09:53,794 --> 00:09:55,427
Okay, you got a lot of rich kids
in your school.

212
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:56,561
What do you want from me?

213
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:57,996
We don't got that kind
of money.

214
00:09:57,998 --> 00:09:59,197
I know.

215
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:00,432
It would just be nice
to go<i> someplace.</i>

216
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:02,000
Oh.

217
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:04,803
You know where you could
take her that's cheap?

218
00:10:04,805 --> 00:10:07,038
My belly-dancing class.

219
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,708
Oh. Put that away.
Seriously.

220
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:13,645
Excuse me. Sir?

221
00:10:13,647 --> 00:10:15,947
I'm here to pick up
my basketball uniform.

222
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,983
Did you
just call me "sir"?

223
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:19,150
Yeah.

224
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:21,353
I'm a girl.

225
00:10:23,357 --> 00:10:26,491
That's one fugly girl.

226
00:10:26,493 --> 00:10:28,126
Hey, man,
that's his daughter.

227
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:31,162
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

228
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:33,732
Hey, honey, how's
the math homework coming?

229
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:35,834
Are any of the tutor's
shortcuts helping?

230
00:10:35,836 --> 00:10:38,236
Did you go on a date?

231
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:39,137
A date?

232
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,940
Who told you
I went on a date?

233
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:43,808
You should really change
your e-mail password,

234
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,243
little miss
oh-seven-two-oh-nine-nine.

235
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:47,145
That is the last time

236
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,147
I use your birthday
as a password.

237
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,683
I can't believe
you read my e-mails.

238
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:54,185
Brendan, I love you,
but we have to learn

239
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:57,288
to respect each other's privacy
in this house.

240
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,024
Who's Jim?

241
00:10:59,026 --> 00:11:01,960
Nobody, honey.
A buffoon.

242
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:04,863
Trust me.
It was nothing.

243
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:06,798
You promise?
Promise.

244
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,299
Whoa!
Whee-ooh! Whee-ooh!

245
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:09,467
Hey!

246
00:11:09,469 --> 00:11:10,869
No wheels in the house!

247
00:11:10,871 --> 00:11:12,737
I've told you this!
Yeah!

248
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:14,172
Tackle him, mom!
Get him!
Hey! Hey!

249
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:15,707
Did your dad take you
for ice cream

250
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:16,775
on the way home from school?

251
00:11:16,777 --> 00:11:17,942
Spank him!

252
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:19,277
Rocky road
and mint chocolate chip!

253
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,179
Take him to the ground!
I'm on top of the world!

254
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,748
Goose, goose!
Aah!

255
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,917
Yeah!
You're dead!

256
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:27,519
No more titty twisters, guys!

257
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:30,922
You only have two titties
for the rest of your lives!

258
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:33,658
We need to learn to love
and respect them.

259
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,160
I always did.

260
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:37,295
How many times
have I told you

261
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:41,132
not to pump him full of sugar
before you drop him off?

262
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:42,300
Oh, come on.

263
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:44,069
Goin' out with dad
for an ice cream cone

264
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:46,171
is a lasting memory
for a kid.

265
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:47,272
Oh, okay.

266
00:11:47,274 --> 00:11:48,940
Well, if dad spent
more time with him,

267
00:11:48,942 --> 00:11:51,810
then the memories wouldn't
have to be so "lasting."

268
00:11:51,812 --> 00:11:53,511
Boom. Zing.
Got me again.

269
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:56,681
It's so great spending time
with you, Lauren.

270
00:11:56,683 --> 00:11:58,516
That doesn't go there.

271
00:11:58,518 --> 00:12:02,320
What are we gonna do?

272
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:04,155
Ah. Oh, man.

273
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:06,758
It's gonna explode
in three, two...

274
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,960
oh, thank God.
That was close.

275
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:11,629
It was almost unorganized
for a minute.

276
00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:13,364
Hi.
How are you?

277
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:15,600
Good. Are you going
to Tyler's game on Saturday?

278
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:17,102
Yes! Of course!

279
00:12:17,104 --> 00:12:18,837
Great.
I'm putting you down.

280
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:21,039
It's what you do best.

281
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:24,075
On the board, mark.
On the board.

282
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:26,044
Lauren, the boys
don't need a board.

283
00:12:26,046 --> 00:12:27,345
They don't need a list.

284
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:30,215
They know they can count on me.
That's it.

285
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:32,517
Dad, can you help me
with my homework?!

286
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:34,018
Oh, I can't, bud!
Sorry!

287
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,187
I gotta go to a thing!
Ask your mom!

288
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:38,623
This is not an example
of my behavior.

289
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:42,127

Larry, wanna shoot
some hoops?
Dad!

305
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:20,732
Aah!
Oh! Sorry!

306
00:13:20,734 --> 00:13:23,401
Stop! Get ou...!
Why wouldn't you knock?!

307
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:25,637
I'm sorry, honey!
I didn't see anything!

308
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,772
Oh, thanks a lot!

309
00:13:27,774 --> 00:13:29,007
No, no, no!

310
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:31,442
There was plenty of stuff
to see!

311
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:32,610
Uh, uh...

312
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:36,147
I mean, I didn't see
any gellin' goin' on!

313
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,783
How 'bout a fist bump?
No!

314
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:42,954
Larry, we both need
this fist bump.

315
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:51,529
We're cool.

316
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:55,400
What do you want?

317
00:13:55,402 --> 00:13:57,735
Oh, I just wanted
to say hi.

318
00:13:57,737 --> 00:13:59,404
Now, well, you did,
now leave. You know?

319
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:02,373
Hey, how we doin'
in here?

320
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,209
I'm talkin' to mom.

321
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:07,312
Great. What are you guys
talkin' about?

322
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:10,315
It's girl stuff.

323
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:12,951
Okay.
Well, just so you know,

324
00:14:12,953 --> 00:14:14,319
I'm pretty good
with girl stuff, too.

325
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:18,189
Excuse me for a second.

326
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:23,261
Thanks, dad, but...
I just want to talk to mom.

327
00:14:23,263 --> 00:14:27,966
Sure, sure.
Say hi for me.

328
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:32,003
I'm all out of stickers.

329
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:34,372
You're all out of face.
What happened to you?

330
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:37,175
Can I play
with ESPN now?

331
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:39,677
ESPN is having
her quiet time.

332
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:42,947
Oh.
With invincible mommy?

333
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:44,549
"Invisible." Yes.

334
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:47,919
It's not fair only ESPN
gets to see her.

335
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:50,655
I know.
I wish I could see her.

336
00:14:50,657 --> 00:14:52,523
Me too.

337
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:53,591
Come here.
Mwah.

338
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:56,327
Mwah!

339
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:58,863
Mmm!

340
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:02,967
Mac and cheese?

341
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:04,702
Mac and cheese.
Yeah!

342
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:13,611
I mean,
he's looking around here.

343
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:15,113
Looking for you.

344
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:18,116
I... you knew it was today.
I published the calendar.

345
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:19,817
Lauren, the meeting
went longer than expected.

346
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:21,920
What... what do you
want from me?
You know what?

347
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:25,623
I just want you to be a dad!
I can't take it!

348
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,959
Why don't you
hop over to the snack bar

349
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:29,627
to see if they sell
any chill pills?

350
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:31,229
Chill pills?

351
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:33,965
Why don't you bust a move
back to 1990?

352
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:35,199
Hi.
Do you want to...?

353
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:37,302
You're at a baseball game?

354
00:15:37,304 --> 00:15:40,038
I'm going on a mystery trip
with dick!

355
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,239
That's so great.

356
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:43,174
I have no idea
where we're going.

357
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:45,476
He's so much fun.
Aah! I'm so excited!

358
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:50,415
Now batting, number 23,
Tyler Reynolds!

359
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:53,584
Okay! Come on!
Go, Tyler!

360
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:54,953
Whoo! Come on, Tyler!

361
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:56,387
They're putting
<i>this</i> kid in?

362
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:57,355
League rule.

363
00:15:57,357 --> 00:15:58,890
Every kid has to play
two innings.

364
00:15:58,892 --> 00:16:00,825
Even kids like him.

365
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:03,795
I'll kick your ass
for two innings,
you better shut
your pie hole

366
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:07,432
you Burt Reynolds
scrawny reject!
Or I'm gonna stuff my entire
fist in your mouth!

367
00:16:07,434 --> 00:16:09,000
Hey, how old
is that pitcher?

368
00:16:09,002 --> 00:16:10,702
He looks like
a nascar driver.

369
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:18,910
Stee-rike!
Come on!

370
00:16:18,912 --> 00:16:21,145
That's okay, buddy!
Shake it off!

371
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,547
It's okay!
Oh, no.

372
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:24,482
He's not gonna have one
of his meltdowns, is he?

373
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:27,785
No, he has two more swings.
It's gonna be okay.

374
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:29,220
Okay,
I better go now, then.

375
00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:30,989
Oh, by the way,
I need a week off.

376
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:32,957
Oh, yeah, sure.
When's the vacation?

377
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,592
Two weeks from today.

378
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:35,760
Wait, no.

379
00:16:35,762 --> 00:16:37,528
That's not gonna work
'cause that's spring break

380
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,797
and I've got to take care
of the boys.

381
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:43,134
Stee-rike two!
Why?!

382
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:44,602
It's okay, cutie!
You got this!

383
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:46,938
Check out what happens
when this kid strikes out.

384
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,607
One more comment like that
and it is go time,
you have been warned,
ratso!

385
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:51,876
Do you understand me?!
So check it!
I will crush you!

386
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:53,778
Checkity check it!

387
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,914
I thought mark was taking
the kids white-water rafting.

388
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,349
Oh, shocker.
He canceled.

389
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:01,119
Business trip.
Now I'm racking my brain

390
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:04,222
trying to figure out
how to compete with that.

391
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:05,590
You won't.
There's no time.

392
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:07,425
And why should we both
stay at home?

393
00:17:07,427 --> 00:17:09,594
You are the bestest
business partner ever.

394
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,965
Stee-rike three!

395
00:17:13,967 --> 00:17:15,800
I hate this! I hate this!
I hate this!

396
00:17:15,802 --> 00:17:17,535
I suck!
No.

397
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:18,436
Aah!

398
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:20,671
Oh, boy.
Here we go again.

399
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:24,809
Aah! Aah!
Aaaah!

400
00:17:25,979 --> 00:17:28,046
Maybe you should try
badminton.

401
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:30,615
Maybe you should try
mouthwash!

402
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:31,916
And deodorant!

403
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:33,518
And some testosterone
supplements!

404
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,019
And some Cialis!

405
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:36,854
I'm just assuming!

406
00:17:36,856 --> 00:17:40,558
And shave your neck!

407
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,261
It's very hairy.

408
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,697
Oh, God.

409
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:40,818
What?

410
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:50,862
Ugh.

411
00:18:50,864 --> 00:18:52,530
Ugh.

412
00:18:52,532 --> 00:18:55,600
No. No.

413
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:05,977
Damn it.

414
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:08,713
<i>Rip that little loop</i>
<i>off the back of your shirt.</i>

415
00:19:08,715 --> 00:19:09,747
<i>And step three...</i>

416
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:12,550
Daddy?
Yes?

417
00:19:12,552 --> 00:19:15,887
What do you miss
about mommy?

418
00:19:15,889 --> 00:19:18,389
What do I miss
about mommy?

419
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:22,627
Hmm.
Everything.

420
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:28,633
I miss her laugh
and her smile,

421
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:32,637
and I miss her little nose
that she gave to you.

422
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:34,305
Luckily
you didn't get mine.

423
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:35,406
You'd look very weird.

424
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:37,508
Yeah.

425
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:41,445
I miss every time
"the wizard of oz" was on.

426
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:44,182
I love that movie.
I know.

427
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:45,950
She would sing
all the songs to us,

428
00:19:45,952 --> 00:19:49,353
especially
"somewhere over the rainbow."

429
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:52,657
You know what I miss most
about her?

430
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:55,059
What?

431
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:59,297
Getting to tell her
how much I love her.

432
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:04,202
Are you allowed to do that
with anyone else?

433
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:07,004
Am I allowed?

434
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:11,342
Your mother,
before she left...

435
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:14,011
That's all
she would talk about

436
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:16,347
was me
finding somebody else.

437
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:19,517
But I would tell her
I can't

438
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:22,353
because
she's my one and only.

439
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:25,523
What did mommy say?

440
00:20:25,525 --> 00:20:30,328
Your mom would say
my heart is so big

441
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,763
that it has room for two.

442
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:36,767
That's another thing I miss
about your mother.

443
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:40,304
She actually thought
I was awesome.

444
00:20:40,306 --> 00:20:43,674
I think
you're awesome, daddy.

445
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:48,112
Thank you.

446
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:49,714
Hey, dad?

447
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:52,149
Um, I-I have
a personal errand to run,

448
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:53,851
and I need
to borrow the car.

449
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:55,786
Well, you can't drive
without me yet,

450
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:58,322
and somebody's got to stay here
with your sisters.

451
00:20:58,324 --> 00:21:01,592
Dad,
I have a personal errand.

452
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,127
What does that even mean?

453
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:05,229
Eh, you taking a hit out
on somebody?

454
00:21:05,231 --> 00:21:08,065
Dad, she's monsterating.

455
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:09,267
What?

456
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:12,470
I have my period!
Oh!

457
00:21:12,472 --> 00:21:14,839
I-I forgot you get those.

458
00:21:14,841 --> 00:21:18,476
Tampax pearls.

459
00:21:18,478 --> 00:21:20,411
Douches. Fresh scent.

460
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:23,914
Medicated and sweet romance.

461
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:28,219
Yeah, let's not be doin' the
sweet romance douches quite yet.

462
00:21:28,221 --> 00:21:30,921
"Poy-see" feminine wash.

463
00:21:30,923 --> 00:21:34,025
Poy-see?
That's a little close, guys.

464
00:21:34,027 --> 00:21:36,160
"Always clean"?

465
00:21:36,162 --> 00:21:39,330
I could actually use those.

466
00:21:39,332 --> 00:21:41,499
Uh...
What's a diva cup?

467
00:21:41,501 --> 00:21:43,401
Is that to make coffee?

468
00:21:43,403 --> 00:21:44,935
I don't under...

469
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:49,607
what kind
do you guys use?

470
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:07,992
No!
Hi.

471
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:12,196
Don't tell me.

472
00:22:12,198 --> 00:22:14,799
Lauren.
Lauren.

473
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:16,701
Mr. Hooters.

474
00:22:16,703 --> 00:22:17,735
Jim.

475
00:22:17,737 --> 00:22:19,870
What's goin' on
in the sweater?

476
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:21,672
Just for the articles?

477
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:22,940
Uh, no.

478
00:22:22,942 --> 00:22:26,344
These, um, actually
are, um, for my son.

479
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:29,280
Wow.
What a progressive mother.

480
00:22:29,282 --> 00:22:34,985
No, I-I found a centerfold
under his bed, and I tore it up.

481
00:22:34,987 --> 00:22:38,456
From a magazine,
not the Internet?

482
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:40,358
He's old school.
I respect that.

483
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,692
Why'd you tear it up?

484
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:44,462
Because as a woman,
I was totally offended.

485
00:22:44,464 --> 00:22:45,663
You don't have to be.

486
00:22:45,665 --> 00:22:47,898
It's a normal part
of growin' up.

487
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:54,572
Okay, but he taped a picture
of our babysitter's face on it.

488
00:22:54,574 --> 00:22:56,507
Okay. That's sick.
He needs help.

489
00:22:56,509 --> 00:22:58,075
Borderline
dahmer situation.

490
00:22:58,077 --> 00:23:00,311
I'm sorry to report that.
Oh, very funny.

491
00:23:00,313 --> 00:23:01,846
Okay, but if you had kids,
you'd understand it's...

492
00:23:01,848 --> 00:23:04,482
Three daughters.
...Complicated.

493
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:06,617
You have three daughters?
Yes.

494
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:10,287
Do you have any other children,
or just the masturbator?

495
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:12,690
He has a younger brother.
Uh-huh.

496
00:23:12,692 --> 00:23:14,625
Well, maybe you'll do
a better job with that kid.

497
00:23:14,627 --> 00:23:16,827
I'm just jokin'.

498
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:18,195
So, what?
You're here to replace it

499
00:23:18,197 --> 00:23:19,630
before the kid finds out?

500
00:23:19,632 --> 00:23:23,033
Yes. But I can't tell
what magazine it's from.

501
00:23:23,035 --> 00:23:24,969
I-I-I just...

502
00:23:24,971 --> 00:23:26,971
Do you have any
of the centerfold remnants?

503
00:23:26,973 --> 00:23:30,641
Yes, I do.

504
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:36,847
I, um... I tried
to tape it back up.

505
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:39,417
Did a great job.
You can hardly tell.

506
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,455
Snapper magazine.

507
00:23:44,457 --> 00:23:45,589
How can you tell?

508
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:47,024
From the staple placement

509
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:48,926
and the, uh, the way
the paper feels,

510
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:50,995
and I already have this copy
at home.

511
00:23:50,997 --> 00:23:52,496
How about a fist bump, uh?

512
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:58,135
Yep, that's the one.
Great.

513
00:23:58,137 --> 00:24:00,037
Excuse me. Actually,
I thought of something

514
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:01,105
that might help us both,

515
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:03,607
um, to save us
some embarrassment.

516
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:06,377
How about I bring that up
to the cashier

517
00:24:06,379 --> 00:24:08,479
and you bring this up
for me?

518
00:24:08,481 --> 00:24:11,282
Whoa. Are these
for your daughter?

519
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:12,550
Yeah. She's 15,

520
00:24:12,552 --> 00:24:15,252
and her "friend"
just paid a visit.

521
00:24:15,254 --> 00:24:20,057
Okay. Well, these are
for a much older "friend."

522
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:21,792
A much heavier "friend"

523
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:26,263
staying in a much bigger "room"
than your daughter has.

524
00:24:26,265 --> 00:24:27,665
You lost me.

525
00:24:27,667 --> 00:24:30,134
You found me.
Oh.

526
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:31,368
Can I get a bump?

527
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:32,370
No.

528
00:24:32,371 --> 00:24:34,205
No.

529
00:24:36,174 --> 00:24:38,242
Okay.
So you will do this.

530
00:24:38,244 --> 00:24:40,244
That'll be $13.

531
00:24:40,246 --> 00:24:41,779
Hi, I'm tom.

532
00:24:41,781 --> 00:24:43,314
Here's your change.

533
00:24:43,316 --> 00:24:44,682
Hi, I'm tom.

534
00:24:44,684 --> 00:24:47,485
Yeah, you told me.
Next.

535
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:52,623
Oh. I remember
the slender fit days.

536
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:55,559
You must be doin'
your kegels.

537
00:24:55,561 --> 00:24:59,330
Nowadays I need six of these
taped together.

538
00:25:00,366 --> 00:25:01,398
Okay. Moving on.

539
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,168
Yeah. And we got...

540
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,737
That and, uh, card.

541
00:25:06,739 --> 00:25:09,707
Rockin' Saturday night,
huh, lefty?

542
00:25:09,709 --> 00:25:10,941
Oh, that's not mine.

543
00:25:10,943 --> 00:25:13,277
That... that's her...
for her kid.

544
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,279
Ooh, pretty progressive mom.

545
00:25:16,516 --> 00:25:18,115
Yeah. That's what I... Said
to her, too.

546
00:25:18,117 --> 00:25:19,083
Why would you do that?

547
00:25:19,085 --> 00:25:21,318
I'm sorry.
What is wrong with you?

548
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,620
I'll get you out of it.

549
00:25:22,622 --> 00:25:25,389
She just takes her homeschooling
real serious,

550
00:25:25,391 --> 00:25:26,624
so that's why...

551
00:25:26,626 --> 00:25:28,559
we get those back?

552
00:25:28,561 --> 00:25:32,062
She's gotta get home to the kid
and get him going, so...

553
00:25:32,064 --> 00:25:34,431
Take care.

554
00:25:34,433 --> 00:25:36,267
Yeah.

555
00:25:36,269 --> 00:25:38,569
Hi, I'm tom.

556
00:25:39,939 --> 00:25:41,539
Thanks a lot for selling me out
back there.

557
00:25:41,541 --> 00:25:43,274
Oh, she didn't even
hear about...

558
00:25:43,276 --> 00:25:46,043
I panicked.
I'm sorry. Here.
Oh, I noticed.

559
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:47,211
Thank you.

560
00:25:47,213 --> 00:25:50,614
I can't believe
<i>you</i> have three girls.

561
00:25:50,616 --> 00:25:51,982
What does that even mean?

562
00:25:51,984 --> 00:25:54,985
I just can't imagine you
with three girls.

563
00:25:54,987 --> 00:25:55,953
Don't, then.

564
00:25:55,955 --> 00:25:58,322
I'm sorry.

565
00:25:58,324 --> 00:25:59,757
What are their names?

566
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:03,527
Hilary, Lou, and ESPN.

567
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:04,695
"Espin."
Mm-hmm.

568
00:26:04,697 --> 00:26:06,330
That's unique.
Mm-hmm.

569
00:26:06,332 --> 00:26:09,433
Is it biblical?
No.

570
00:26:09,435 --> 00:26:11,835
Named after
my favorite network.

571
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:20,144
ESPN.

572
00:26:20,146 --> 00:26:21,445
No.
Yep.

573
00:26:21,447 --> 00:26:22,680
What?

574
00:26:22,682 --> 00:26:24,748
Pretty cool.

575
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,750
Oh, my God.

576
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:29,653
Your wife
must have been a Saint.

577
00:26:29,655 --> 00:26:31,188
She was.

578
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:35,960
Your husband must have been
very patient dealing with...

579
00:26:35,962 --> 00:26:37,361
Oh.

580
00:26:37,363 --> 00:26:41,632
Another charming sentiment
from captain cheese sticks.

581
00:26:41,634 --> 00:26:43,534
You know what?
Hooters is too good for you.

582
00:26:43,536 --> 00:26:44,902
I'd never
bring you there again.

583
00:26:44,904 --> 00:26:47,071
Oh, well, then I guess
I'll just have to learn

584
00:26:47,073 --> 00:26:48,939
to get through life
without Hooters.

585
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:51,742
You've been doin' a pretty
damn good job so far!

586
00:26:51,744 --> 00:26:53,711
That doesn't make
any sense.

587
00:26:53,713 --> 00:26:57,047
No, they... I didn't realize
they were that big.

588
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:04,321
Oh, whatever.

589
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:16,634
Guys, unfortunately,

590
00:27:16,636 --> 00:27:18,769
your dad had a business trip
that came up,

591
00:27:18,771 --> 00:27:20,371
so your whitewater
rafting trip

592
00:27:20,373 --> 00:27:22,439
is gonna get postponed
till this summer.

593
00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:25,209
What?!
So we're stuck here
doing nothing all week?!

594
00:27:25,211 --> 00:27:28,178
I have plans. I have
great plans actually.

595
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:31,548
Like what? Bowling
and going to the mall?

596
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,150
How did you know?

597
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:34,718
Bet that's dad!

598
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,987
Maybe he'll take us
on his business trip!

599
00:27:38,356 --> 00:27:41,158
Oh, hey.
Is your mom home?

600
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,094
What do you mean,
"is your mom home"?
Who are you?

601
00:27:44,096 --> 00:27:45,529
I'm Jim.

602
00:27:45,531 --> 00:27:49,433
Jim?
"Jim66@dsg. Com"?

603
00:27:49,435 --> 00:27:52,703
What is this, "dateline nbc"?
Yes, you got it right.

604
00:27:52,705 --> 00:27:54,138
What do you want?

605
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,973
I need to talk to your mother.
Not a big deal.

606
00:27:55,975 --> 00:27:57,908
She said
she's not interested in you.

607
00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:00,277
Well, believe me, Frodo,
I don't like her either.

608
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:02,046
Unfortunately, I have to sort
something out with her.

609
00:28:02,048 --> 00:28:04,214
Brendan, honey,
who's at the...

610
00:28:04,216 --> 00:28:07,151
hey.
Jim.

611
00:28:07,153 --> 00:28:09,319
You lied!
Liar! You like him!

612
00:28:09,321 --> 00:28:12,089
What? I didn't lie, honey.
He's a buffoon.

613
00:28:12,091 --> 00:28:13,991
Just like I said.
Don't talk to me!

614
00:28:13,993 --> 00:28:15,926
Ever!
What?

615
00:28:15,928 --> 00:28:19,163
No, sweetie, come on.

616
00:28:19,165 --> 00:28:20,230
What?

617
00:28:20,232 --> 00:28:21,732
Great.

618
00:28:21,734 --> 00:28:23,767
Which one was the masturbator?
The big one?

619
00:28:23,769 --> 00:28:26,203
Why are you here?
What do you want?

620
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:28,939
The old bag at the pharmacy
mixed up our cards.

621
00:28:28,941 --> 00:28:30,240
Well, that's impossible

622
00:28:30,242 --> 00:28:31,775
because I keep my cards
very organized.

623
00:28:31,777 --> 00:28:33,377
In fact, I keep them
in color-coded sleeves...

624
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:35,746
all right, I'll give this back
to whoever it belongs to.

625
00:28:35,748 --> 00:28:36,947
Lauren Reynolds.

626
00:28:36,949 --> 00:28:38,649
You know her?
Have you met her?

627
00:28:38,651 --> 00:28:41,051
Oh.
God, I...

628
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:43,053
I don't know what's wrong
with me lately.

629
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:44,722
I feel like
I'm losing my mind.

630
00:28:44,724 --> 00:28:46,190
Just come in.

631
00:28:46,192 --> 00:28:49,026
So wait.
How do you know where I live?

632
00:28:49,028 --> 00:28:52,262
I googled you
and "closet queens" came up.

633
00:28:52,264 --> 00:28:53,664
You're a lesbian?

634
00:28:53,666 --> 00:28:55,933
No.

635
00:28:56,634 --> 00:28:59,403
We organize "closets."

636
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:01,839
And we're the best,
so we're "queens."

637
00:29:01,841 --> 00:29:03,107
"Closet queens."

638
00:29:03,109 --> 00:29:06,110
Maybe the picture
was confusing me.

639
00:29:06,112 --> 00:29:07,845
What picture?

640
00:29:10,348 --> 00:29:13,016
Oh, those little weasels.

641
00:29:13,018 --> 00:29:15,853
Your girlfriend, like, does
she know we went on a date?

642
00:29:15,855 --> 00:29:17,888
Is she gonna kill me?
She looks nuts.

643
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:19,923
Lauren!
Well, here she is.

644
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:20,991
I have to talk to you!

645
00:29:20,993 --> 00:29:23,026
Uh...
I-I never touched her.

646
00:29:23,028 --> 00:29:24,495
Sh-she repulses me.

647
00:29:24,497 --> 00:29:25,996
What?
What?

648
00:29:25,998 --> 00:29:27,231
Jen, what's wrong?

649
00:29:27,233 --> 00:29:29,366
It's over
between me and dick.

650
00:29:29,368 --> 00:29:31,568
Over?
I thought you don't like dick.

651
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:35,539
But you guys just started
using the "l" word.

652
00:29:35,541 --> 00:29:36,907
"The l word."
I saw that show.

653
00:29:36,909 --> 00:29:38,809
You guys love that one
I'm... I'm guessin'.

654
00:29:38,811 --> 00:29:39,910
I'm sorry. Who are you?

655
00:29:39,912 --> 00:29:41,245
Are you here
to fix something?

656
00:29:41,247 --> 00:29:42,813
'Cause you should probably
just go and do that.

657
00:29:42,815 --> 00:29:44,748
I'm Jim.
I'm not a threat.

658
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,316
Jim?

659
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:48,285
The blind-date guy.

660
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:49,920
You said
that was a disaster.

661
00:29:49,922 --> 00:29:51,255
Oh, it was.

662
00:29:51,257 --> 00:29:54,324
You said
he was a chubby loser.
He is.

663
00:29:54,326 --> 00:29:57,661
You didn't mention he has
that high phlegmy voice

664
00:29:57,663 --> 00:29:59,763
like he drinks
a lot of dairy.

665
00:29:59,765 --> 00:30:01,398
I know...
standin' right here,
ladies.

666
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,466
Hearin' everything.

667
00:30:02,468 --> 00:30:04,201
All right, our cards
got switched,

668
00:30:04,203 --> 00:30:05,702
so we're just dealing
with that.

669
00:30:05,704 --> 00:30:06,970
What happened with dick?

670
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:09,439
He just dropped
a major bomb on me.

671
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:10,774
He's married.

672
00:30:10,776 --> 00:30:13,577
No, worse.
He's got kids.

673
00:30:16,916 --> 00:30:19,716
Oh, you're still here.
Why?

674
00:30:19,718 --> 00:30:22,820
You still have my card.
"Why?"

675
00:30:22,822 --> 00:30:24,154
Wait.

676
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:26,356
You're just gonna break up
with him

677
00:30:26,358 --> 00:30:27,624
because he has children?

678
00:30:27,626 --> 00:30:30,828
Five children.
Five.

679
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,229
What am I, Julie Andrews?

680
00:30:32,231 --> 00:30:34,164
I'm gonna sew
matching outfits

681
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:36,066
and sing
to escape the Nazis?

682
00:30:36,068 --> 00:30:38,702
He asked me if I wanted to be
"part of the team."

683
00:30:38,704 --> 00:30:40,070
No, I don't!

684
00:30:40,072 --> 00:30:41,939
Well, maybe you should
just go on the trip

685
00:30:41,941 --> 00:30:43,607
and, you know, spend
some alone time with dick

686
00:30:43,609 --> 00:30:44,908
and then...
oh, no.

687
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:46,944
See, he wanted the kids
to come with us.

688
00:30:46,946 --> 00:30:48,679
He wanted me
to get to know them

689
00:30:48,681 --> 00:30:50,547
in a "fun and neutral
environment."

690
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:51,849
Eh, eh, eh, five kids?

691
00:30:51,851 --> 00:30:53,784
Is his last name
theodopolis?

692
00:30:53,786 --> 00:30:55,018
Yes.

693
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,653
That's incredible.
That's my boss.

694
00:30:56,655 --> 00:30:59,356
What?
He owns all
the dick's sporting goods.

695
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:01,491
I-I manage the one
in Ridgefield.

696
00:31:01,493 --> 00:31:02,559
Of course you do.

697
00:31:02,561 --> 00:31:05,395
Dick takes a lot
of special-needs people

698
00:31:05,397 --> 00:31:08,198
and makes them "managers"
of something

699
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,667
so they can have a business card
and feel important.

700
00:31:10,669 --> 00:31:11,902
Good for you!

701
00:31:11,904 --> 00:31:14,671
That explains it.
That explains a lot.

702
00:31:14,673 --> 00:31:17,274
You know, actually I applied
to work at closet queens,

703
00:31:17,276 --> 00:31:19,610
but they said there's already
a gorilla

704
00:31:19,612 --> 00:31:20,878
Filling that position.

705
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,814
It's a thyroid thing.

706
00:31:25,084 --> 00:31:26,583
Where was he gonna take you?

707
00:31:26,585 --> 00:31:27,985
Africa.

708
00:31:27,987 --> 00:31:30,153
It was gonna be incredible.
Look at that.

709
00:31:30,155 --> 00:31:32,823
My God.
Sun, sand, safaris.
Wow.

710
00:31:32,825 --> 00:31:33,991
Oh, my God.
What do we got?

711
00:31:33,993 --> 00:31:35,959
He must really
like you a lot.

712
00:31:35,961 --> 00:31:38,862
Sorry, I'm not gettin' it
at all.

713
00:31:38,864 --> 00:31:41,198
Okay. And this
concludes our business.

714
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,234
Thank you.
Africa.

715
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:46,470
So he's just gonna go here
all by himself

716
00:31:46,472 --> 00:31:47,971
with his kids now?

717
00:31:47,973 --> 00:31:50,340
No.
He's heartbroken now.

718
00:31:50,342 --> 00:31:53,210
Nobody gets to go.
Oh, damn it!

719
00:31:53,212 --> 00:31:55,779
Why does he have
to have joint custody?

720
00:31:55,781 --> 00:31:57,781
I thought the mother
always got the kids.

721
00:31:57,783 --> 00:31:59,349
I mean,
this is a week away.

722
00:31:59,351 --> 00:32:01,184
I hope
he gets his money back.

723
00:32:01,186 --> 00:32:02,653
A week out?
Aah!

724
00:32:02,655 --> 00:32:04,121
Not a chance.

725
00:32:04,123 --> 00:32:06,957
Well, maybe they do things
differently in Africa.

726
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:08,292
Oh, I forgot you were an expert

727
00:32:08,294 --> 00:32:09,860
at closets
and African refund policies.

728
00:32:09,862 --> 00:32:11,128
Okay. Kick him out.

729
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:13,196
Don't let him talk
to you like that.

730
00:32:13,198 --> 00:32:15,866
Get out.
I'm leavin'.

731
00:32:15,868 --> 00:32:18,769
Jen.
My boys would give anything

732
00:32:18,771 --> 00:32:21,371
to go
on a vacation like this.

733
00:32:21,373 --> 00:32:24,007
Mr. theodopolis. Hi.
It's Jim Friedman.

734
00:32:24,009 --> 00:32:26,143
I don't mean
to be a vulture

735
00:32:26,145 --> 00:32:29,179
picking on the carcass
of your dead relationship,

736
00:32:29,181 --> 00:32:30,647
but I wonder...

737
00:32:30,649 --> 00:32:32,816
...if you'd be willin'
to sell me the vacation

738
00:32:32,818 --> 00:32:35,285
you were gonna go on
with Freddy krueger's sister?

739
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:37,120
I mean, I have been
saving and saving.

740
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:39,122
I could never give him
full value for it...

741
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:41,224
...but somethin's better
than nothin', right, sir?

742
00:32:41,226 --> 00:32:42,826
It would just be
the three of us.

743
00:32:42,828 --> 00:32:45,796
It would just be the four of us,
so we'd only need one room.

744
00:32:45,798 --> 00:32:47,331
Oh, my God.

745
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:49,299
Wait until
I tell the boys!

746
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:51,501
Oh.
Wait till I tell the girls!

747
00:32:51,503 --> 00:32:53,570
We're going to Africa!

748
00:32:53,572 --> 00:32:55,005
Aah!
Yeah!

749
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:14,224
I can't believe
we're here.

750
00:33:14,226 --> 00:33:16,026

What is happening
right now?

769
00:34:01,673 --> 00:34:04,141

How about you don't correct
my daughter, okay?

772
00:34:10,082 --> 00:34:12,015
She can say "butthole"
if she wants to.

773
00:34:12,017 --> 00:34:14,284
Butthole! Butthole!
Not you.

774
00:34:14,286 --> 00:34:18,221
I hear thunder on the Mountain.

You still haven't told
the children, my friends?

794

Will you do us a favor?

796
00:35:11,543 --> 00:35:14,077
Just leave us alone

Thank you.
All right. Listen.

799
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:21,518
Would you just reassure my son
that we're not dating?

800
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,954
We are not dating!
I promise you.

00:35:23,956 --> 00:35:27,524
This is not a face I want
to wake up to every morning.

802
00:35:27,526 --> 00:35:28,725
Wow.

803
00:35:28,727 --> 00:35:30,894
You'd be lucky to wake up
to that every day.

804
00:35:30,896 --> 00:35:32,329
My mom is friggin' hot.

805
00:35:32,331 --> 00:35:34,164
Did you just say
your mom was hot?

806
00:35:34,166 --> 00:35:35,665
No! Not hot!

807
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:37,968
That's just wrong.

808
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:40,370
Tyler! Tyler!
Whoo! Yeah!

809
00:35:40,372 --> 00:35:41,771
Get down from there!

810
00:35:41,773 --> 00:35:43,273
Whee-hee!
Oh, God!

811
00:35:43,275 --> 00:35:44,741
Please, please, please...
Whoa!

812
00:35:44,743 --> 00:35:45,976
...please get down!

813
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:48,345
Whoo!
Aah!

814
00:35:48,347 --> 00:35:51,081
This place is ginormous!

815
00:35:51,083 --> 00:35:52,249
Oh, my God!

816
00:35:52,251 --> 00:35:55,051
Follow me.
Right this way.

817
00:35:55,053 --> 00:35:58,388
Welcome to your familymoon.

818
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:59,789
Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa!

819
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:02,292
This is so cool.

820
00:36:02,294 --> 00:36:04,094
Whoa-ho!
Now we're talkin'!

821
00:36:04,096 --> 00:36:05,962
This is Africa, baby!

822
00:36:05,964 --> 00:36:07,030
We'll take this room.

823
00:36:07,032 --> 00:36:09,432
No!
We want this room.

824
00:36:09,434 --> 00:36:13,570
Silly theocropolises!
This is for the children.

825
00:36:13,572 --> 00:36:18,241
This room is
for the mama and the papa.

826
00:36:19,745 --> 00:36:22,679
- Whoa.
- Look at that bed.

827
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:24,514
- Huge!
- Yeah!

828
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:26,650
Awesome.
Look at all this candy.

829
00:36:26,652 --> 00:36:29,319
Here is where you make
more theopotamuses.

830
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,490
My bad.

831
00:36:33,492 --> 00:36:37,027
What part of "not dating"
does this bed fit into?

832
00:36:37,029 --> 00:36:38,428
Oh, boy.

833
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:41,565
Okay. You know what?
Everybody fall into line.

834
00:36:41,567 --> 00:36:44,134
Brendan, Tyler, honey,
I need you on the couch.

835
00:36:44,136 --> 00:36:45,769
Hilary, uh, c-span, Lou...

836
00:36:45,771 --> 00:36:47,137
ESPN, ESPN.

837
00:36:47,139 --> 00:36:48,305
E-e-e-excuse me...

838
00:36:48,307 --> 00:36:49,906
ESPN.
I'm sorry, honey.

839
00:36:49,908 --> 00:36:54,344
Oh, my God.
Dick was gonna propose to Jen.

840
00:36:54,346 --> 00:36:58,148
A family honeymoon.
A "familymoon."

841
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,516
And your dumb friend
ruined it.

842
00:36:59,518 --> 00:37:00,817
So here's what's
gonna happen.

843
00:37:00,819 --> 00:37:02,986
The first room we saw,
we're gonna take that.

844
00:37:02,988 --> 00:37:04,454
And you
and your deranged boys

845
00:37:04,456 --> 00:37:06,456
can have wilt Chamberlain's
headquarters.

846
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:08,391
Dude,
what are you eating?

847
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:10,460
Mm. "Cherry panties."

848
00:37:10,462 --> 00:37:13,763
What are "cherry panties"?

849
00:37:13,765 --> 00:37:14,831
Let me see that.

850
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:16,800
Oh, no! God!

851
00:37:16,802 --> 00:37:18,235
Spit it out!
Why?

852
00:37:18,237 --> 00:37:19,469
Spit it out! Just...

853
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:21,037
no cherry panties ever!
Out, out, out!

854
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:22,305
Hey, mom.

855
00:37:22,307 --> 00:37:24,541
I guess this
used to be a firehouse.

856
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,913
Aaaaah!

857
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:39,489
Look at this place.
Wow.

858
00:37:39,491 --> 00:37:42,058
Hello, Mr. snuffleupagus.

859
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,994
Uh, theodopolis.

860
00:37:43,996 --> 00:37:46,796
Hello...

861
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:48,999
Girls.

862
00:37:49,001 --> 00:37:51,234
Girls.
They're girls.

863
00:37:51,236 --> 00:37:54,604
That's twice.
Let's go, guys... girls.

864
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:57,507
23.
Lookin' for 23.

865
00:37:57,509 --> 00:38:01,745
There it is.

866
00:38:04,283 --> 00:38:06,716
Oh! Hi!
Hey.

867
00:38:06,718 --> 00:38:09,286
How you doin'? I-I think
we're sharin' a table with ya.

868
00:38:09,288 --> 00:38:10,887
Yeah. Hi!
I'm eddy wernick,

869
00:38:10,889 --> 00:38:13,623
and this is ginger wernick
and our son, Jake.

870
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:16,259
We're from Vancouver.

871
00:38:16,261 --> 00:38:17,727
'Kay.
I'm your son, all right?

872
00:38:17,729 --> 00:38:20,030
Ginger would've had to give
birth to me when she was 6.

873
00:38:20,032 --> 00:38:21,264
She's not my mom.

874
00:38:21,266 --> 00:38:23,366
Okay. Get it out there
for everyone.

875
00:38:23,368 --> 00:38:24,567
Sharin' it, lovin' it.

876
00:38:24,569 --> 00:38:26,202
No holdin' back.
That's good.

877
00:38:26,204 --> 00:38:28,138
All right, all right. Let's do
our thing. Come on. Come on.

878
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,073
Isn't this place fantastic?

879
00:38:30,075 --> 00:38:31,541
So romantic.
Ahhh.

880
00:38:31,543 --> 00:38:34,444
Good.
Gonna have a nice trip here.

881
00:38:34,446 --> 00:38:36,546
Um, dad?
Hey, sweetie.

882
00:38:36,548 --> 00:38:37,814
Where should I sit?

883
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:39,482
You can sit
anywhere you want.

884
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:41,885
What about mom?
Where does she sit?

885
00:38:41,887 --> 00:38:44,354
Uh, where do you want her
to sit?

886
00:38:44,356 --> 00:38:45,855
Next to me?

887
00:38:45,857 --> 00:38:47,524
Then, that's where
she'll sit.

888
00:38:47,526 --> 00:38:48,825
Go ahead.
You... you s...

889
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:50,894
get right next to Lou.
Your mom's right there.

890
00:38:50,896 --> 00:38:52,095
Okay.
Okay?

891
00:38:52,097 --> 00:38:54,397
Mm-hmm.
All good.

892
00:38:54,399 --> 00:38:57,667
Ignorin' it.
Ignorin' the weirdness.

893
00:38:57,669 --> 00:39:01,738
Ah. Where's the funeral
at, boys?

894
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,673
Where's the golf tournament
at, girls?

895
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:06,209
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no.

896
00:39:06,211 --> 00:39:07,944
Mfana. Mfana!

897
00:39:07,946 --> 00:39:10,213
Yes! Mrs. uh...

898
00:39:10,215 --> 00:39:11,481
Reynolds.
Palmer!

899
00:39:11,483 --> 00:39:12,849
Just not his wife, okay?

900
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:15,118
I don't wanna sit here.
Not gonna happen.

901
00:39:16,355 --> 00:39:18,588
I'm afraid it must happen,
ma'am.

902
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:21,958
All tables are filled,
a-and this is your family.

903
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,326
Please sit with us.

904
00:39:23,328 --> 00:39:25,795
You give it a try.

905
00:39:25,797 --> 00:39:26,930
Okay.

906
00:39:26,932 --> 00:39:30,367
Every family fights.
You make it better.

907
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:31,668
Mm-hmm.
Yes?

908
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:33,937
Yes.
Try the chakalaka.

909
00:39:33,939 --> 00:39:35,105
Hi, new people.

910
00:39:35,107 --> 00:39:36,339
Hello.

911
00:39:36,341 --> 00:39:37,841
This is Lauren, by the way,

912
00:39:37,843 --> 00:39:39,976
and her children,
the karate kids,

913
00:39:39,978 --> 00:39:41,344
wax on and wax
off.

914
00:39:41,346 --> 00:39:43,246
Oh.

915
00:39:43,248 --> 00:39:46,082
Isn't this place fantastic?

916
00:39:46,084 --> 00:39:48,318
Oh, it's so romantic.

917
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,453
Sorry,
wh-what'd you say?

918
00:39:50,455 --> 00:39:52,956
So romantic!

919
00:39:52,958 --> 00:39:54,224
Easy.

920
00:39:54,226 --> 00:39:55,859
Keepin' it classy,
huh, ginger?

921
00:39:55,861 --> 00:39:58,495
Oh, jakey, you have something
on your face.

922
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:01,965
Oh, it's a mole.

923
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:05,435
Hey!
You can't sit there.

924
00:40:05,437 --> 00:40:06,669
Why not?

925
00:40:06,671 --> 00:40:07,837
My mom's sitting there.

926
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:10,607
Is she in the bathroom
or something?

927
00:40:10,609 --> 00:40:12,175
No. She's sitting there
right now.

928
00:40:14,211 --> 00:40:15,945
Are you on meds or...
ow!

929
00:40:15,947 --> 00:40:20,350
It's okay, ESPN.
We'll get Brendan another chair.

930
00:40:20,352 --> 00:40:22,685
Thank you.
Whatever.

931
00:40:22,687 --> 00:40:24,387
I'm just gonna go
to the buffet.

932
00:40:24,389 --> 00:40:25,522
Tyler, come with me.

933
00:40:25,524 --> 00:40:26,890
They eat
fried caterpillars here.

934
00:40:26,892 --> 00:40:29,692
- Hell yeah!
- Very nice.

935
00:40:29,694 --> 00:40:31,194
Girls, why don't you hit
the buffet also?

936
00:40:31,196 --> 00:40:33,263
Larry, make sure you have
plenty of beef, 'kay?

937
00:40:33,265 --> 00:40:34,464
Gotta bulk up
for the season.

938
00:40:34,466 --> 00:40:36,800
Love ya.
Go on.

939
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:40,236
"Bulk up for the season"?

940
00:40:40,238 --> 00:40:41,438
What is she? A bear?

941
00:40:42,808 --> 00:40:45,074
She's trying out for
girls' varsity this year.

942
00:40:45,076 --> 00:40:47,043
A lot of big ladies
out there.
Oh.

943
00:40:47,045 --> 00:40:49,479
So she's gonna eat her way
into the starting five.

944
00:40:49,481 --> 00:40:50,547
My God.

945
00:40:53,452 --> 00:40:56,152
Hello, everybody!

946
00:40:56,154 --> 00:40:59,088
My name is nickens.

947
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:02,358
And we are thathoo!

948
00:41:03,829 --> 00:41:07,664
We play traditional
South African isicathamiya music

949
00:41:07,666 --> 00:41:12,469
with a little bit
of American soul.

950
00:41:12,471 --> 00:41:15,004
Yebo!

951
00:41:15,006 --> 00:41:17,540
Whoo! It is getting
a little hot in here.

952
00:41:17,542 --> 00:41:18,808
Whoo!
Yes.

953
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:23,046
Finally, my huge African arms
are free.

954
00:41:23,048 --> 00:41:24,681
Yeah, baby!

955
00:41:24,683 --> 00:41:26,816
Yes, they are.

956
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:28,251
No.

957
00:41:28,253 --> 00:41:30,753
I would like to welcome you

958
00:41:30,755 --> 00:41:35,291
to our fourth annual
blended familymoon week!

959
00:41:36,862 --> 00:41:39,195
Yebo!

960
00:41:39,197 --> 00:41:40,396
What's a blended family?

961
00:41:40,398 --> 00:41:42,298
I don't know.
It sounds painful, though.

962
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:46,803
I am looking out at all
you beautiful stepchildren...

963
00:41:46,805 --> 00:41:49,005
Stepdads...
Stepmoms...

964
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:51,941
Half-brothers,
same-sex domestic partners...

965
00:41:51,943 --> 00:41:56,412
...and good old-fashioned
Booty calls gone wrong.

966
00:41:57,949 --> 00:42:02,485
Now, even though the emphasis
is on family,

967
00:42:02,487 --> 00:42:05,822
we here, at the beautiful
sun city resort,

968
00:42:05,824 --> 00:42:10,293
want to make sure you get
some alone time.

969
00:42:10,295 --> 00:42:12,395
Oh!

970
00:42:12,397 --> 00:42:18,134
Because alone time
can sometime take a long time.

971
00:42:18,136 --> 00:42:20,570
We have many
supervised activities

972
00:42:20,572 --> 00:42:22,071
for the young ones to do.

973
00:42:22,073 --> 00:42:25,942
We have a fabulous
jungle play zone.

974
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:34,651
A nightly pool party.

975
00:42:34,653 --> 00:42:37,420
Hey, ESPN.
Why aren't you getting in?

976
00:42:37,422 --> 00:42:39,756
Is your mom afraid
of the water?

977
00:42:39,758 --> 00:42:42,559
Good one, mom.

978
00:42:42,561 --> 00:42:44,694
Magical animal time.

979
00:42:44,696 --> 00:42:47,897
Little one,
wouldn't you like

980
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:50,800
to try petting
a living animal?

981
00:42:50,802 --> 00:42:54,304
He's dead?

982
00:42:54,306 --> 00:42:59,275
And our famous
tekula teen disco!

983
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:02,912
Hey, dude.

984
00:43:02,914 --> 00:43:06,249
There's a lot
of hot chicks out here.

985
00:43:20,532 --> 00:43:23,266
The best time. Yeah.

986
00:43:24,903 --> 00:43:27,804
What the heck is...

987
00:43:27,806 --> 00:43:29,305
what is that?

988
00:43:30,341 --> 00:43:33,076
Are you kidding me?

989
00:43:33,078 --> 00:43:35,478
Oh, my God!
Are you kidding me?

990
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,480
Oh, my God!
Oh, God!

991
00:43:37,482 --> 00:43:39,682
Oh, God!
Crocodile!

992
00:43:39,684 --> 00:43:41,250
Crocodile attack!

993
00:43:41,252 --> 00:43:43,620
Help me!
Somebody help me!

994
00:43:43,622 --> 00:43:46,689
Please don't kill me!
God! Oh, my God!

995
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:52,695
Mr. bellyflopolis,
the crocodiles are fake!

996
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,368
They're fake?!

997
00:43:58,370 --> 00:44:00,370
Yes, they're fake!

998
00:44:00,372 --> 00:44:05,008
Why would you make
them look so realistic?!

999
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:08,244
Well, to scare
the baboons away.

1000
00:44:08,246 --> 00:44:13,349
You just scared a zebra stripe
into my underwear!

1001
00:44:13,351 --> 00:44:14,684
Don't worry!

1002
00:44:14,686 --> 00:44:17,620
What happens in Africa,
stays in Africa.

1003
00:44:25,295 --> 00:44:29,699
Oh. Oh. Tyler. Okay.

1004
00:44:29,701 --> 00:44:31,668
Excuse me.
Oh!

1005
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:33,169
Okay.

1006
00:44:36,041 --> 00:44:37,407
Oh! Oh!

1007
00:44:37,409 --> 00:44:41,077
Uh, that's one way to get him
to sleep through the night.

1008
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:43,346
You saw that?
No, I actually heard it.

1009
00:44:43,348 --> 00:44:44,947
I think they heard it
in Uganda.

1010
00:44:44,949 --> 00:44:47,083
It was a lot easier
when he was Lou's age.

1011
00:44:47,085 --> 00:44:48,985
Of course,
let me help ya out here.

1012
00:44:48,987 --> 00:44:50,453
Here ya are.
You're home.

1013
00:44:50,455 --> 00:44:51,821
Thank you.
Absolu... uh-oh!

1014
00:44:51,823 --> 00:44:52,955
Whoa!
Too late.

1015
00:44:52,957 --> 00:44:54,257
Oh, whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1016
00:44:54,259 --> 00:44:55,825
Whoa, all right,
all right, all right.

1017
00:44:55,827 --> 00:44:57,960
Pick... pick... pick him up.
Three-second rule.

1018
00:44:57,962 --> 00:45:00,063
Oh, God!
Three-second rule.

1019
00:45:00,065 --> 00:45:02,231
Good, good, good.
You're fine. He's fine.

1020
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:18,748
Okay,
now I'm getting scared.

1021
00:45:20,784 --> 00:45:21,884
Okay.

1022
00:45:23,855 --> 00:45:27,223
Sleep, sleep.

1023
00:45:27,225 --> 00:45:30,259
Too hot in here.
No blanket, okay?

1024
00:45:30,261 --> 00:45:32,462
Shh.

1025
00:45:32,464 --> 00:45:35,298
Here's your buddy.

1026
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:38,868
Love ya, love ya.

1027
00:45:42,806 --> 00:45:44,741
Mom's sleeping there.

1028
00:45:44,743 --> 00:45:46,976
Okay, can I sleep with her?

1029
00:45:46,978 --> 00:45:49,011
No, you'll crush her.

1030
00:45:49,013 --> 00:45:51,481
No, I just... I could get in
with her and spoon with her.

1031
00:45:51,483 --> 00:45:52,749
It would be nice.

1032
00:45:52,751 --> 00:45:54,584
I don't wanna see that.

1033
00:45:54,586 --> 00:45:56,853
- No.
- Okay.

1034
00:45:56,855 --> 00:45:58,654
We'll let mommy rest.

1035
00:45:58,656 --> 00:46:00,623
I'll, uh, I'll figure it out.

1036
00:46:00,625 --> 00:46:01,891
I love you.

1037
00:46:01,893 --> 00:46:03,493
I love you too, dad.
Good night.

1038
00:46:03,495 --> 00:46:04,627
Sleep good.

1039
00:46:06,931 --> 00:46:09,665
Me and you there, shorty.

1040
00:46:09,667 --> 00:46:13,703
Okay, that's right.
Right on my neck.

1041
00:46:13,705 --> 00:46:17,507
That's gonna make a nice evening
for me.

1042
00:46:36,827 --> 00:46:41,264
Hey, guys.
It is time to wake up.

1043
00:46:41,266 --> 00:46:45,668
Africa awaits us.
It's a beautiful morning.

1044
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:46,936
Is he crazy?

1045
00:46:46,938 --> 00:46:49,338
Go away.
It's way too early.

1046
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:52,508
Lou, will you wake up
with daddy, please?

1047
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:56,879
In the name
of Lucifer, let us sleep.

1048
00:46:58,382 --> 00:47:02,885
Up, up, up, you two.
I have quite a day planned.

1049
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:08,257
I need a coffee.

1050
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:13,996
Morning.

1051
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:16,032
Big day planned?

1052
00:47:16,034 --> 00:47:19,435
Oh, yeah.
7:15 nature walk.

1053
00:47:19,437 --> 00:47:22,538
8:30 petting zoo.
10:00 A.M. native crafts.

1054
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:25,374
Ah.
The boys,
they're so excited.

1055
00:47:25,376 --> 00:47:27,009
Oh, really? My girls
are ecstatic also.

1056
00:47:27,011 --> 00:47:28,811
They're just jumping
up and down on the bed.

1057
00:47:28,813 --> 00:47:29,946
Can't believe
they're here.

1058
00:47:29,948 --> 00:47:32,181
- Cream?
- No, thank you.

1059
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:35,384
- Sugar?
- Yes, please.

1060
00:47:37,254 --> 00:47:39,155
Couldn't get the boys
out of bed, could you?

1061
00:47:39,157 --> 00:47:40,790
No.
The girls?

1062
00:47:40,792 --> 00:47:43,092
The girls are probably sleeping
the rest of the trip.

1063
00:47:43,094 --> 00:47:46,062
So... Possible exorcism coming
for the little one.

1064
00:47:46,064 --> 00:47:47,897
We'll see what happens.

1065
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:51,267
Well, it's beautiful here.

1066
00:47:51,269 --> 00:47:52,269
Oh, yeah.

1067
00:47:57,941 --> 00:47:59,842
I'll see you around.

1068
00:47:59,844 --> 00:48:01,844
Yeah. Have a good one.

1069
00:48:01,846 --> 00:48:06,449
You won't see that
in New Jersey.

1070
00:48:06,451 --> 00:48:08,451
Okay. All right.

1071
00:48:08,453 --> 00:48:10,486
All right. Here we go. Okay.
Here you go, baby.

1072
00:48:10,488 --> 00:48:11,821
That's it, sweetie.
Take him down.

1073
00:48:11,823 --> 00:48:13,789
Take him!
That's it. Back him.

1074
00:48:13,791 --> 00:48:15,591
Use your weight!
Muscle him!

1075
00:48:16,861 --> 00:48:18,561
Use your body.

1076
00:48:18,563 --> 00:48:20,429
Oh, yes!
Finish it!

1077
00:48:22,033 --> 00:48:23,266
And bam!
That's it! Yes!

1078
00:48:23,268 --> 00:48:25,935
Yes!
Way to go, Larry.

1079
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:30,339
Winner's up. Let's go.
Gimme the ball.

1080
00:48:30,341 --> 00:48:32,008
Buddy.

1081
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:33,376
Up top.

1082
00:48:34,778 --> 00:48:36,045
And we go in.

1083
00:48:36,047 --> 00:48:37,546
Let's go. Get loose.

1084
00:48:37,548 --> 00:48:40,249
Cut. Cut!

1085
00:48:40,251 --> 00:48:41,183
Larry! Move!

1086
00:48:41,185 --> 00:48:44,020
Come on.
What are you doin'?

1087
00:48:46,723 --> 00:48:49,458
Larry?
Just cut!

1088
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:50,493
Go! Break it.

1089
00:48:50,495 --> 00:48:53,095
Shake him off. Come on.
Are you...

1090
00:48:53,097 --> 00:48:54,797
are you voguing right now?

1091
00:48:54,799 --> 00:48:57,166
What is happening?

1092
00:48:57,168 --> 00:48:59,168
Here!
Just take the ball.

1093
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:01,938
Work the kid. Work him.
Lose him.

1094
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:04,840
Cross him. Cross him over.
Cross him.

1095
00:49:04,842 --> 00:49:06,342
Don't skip!
Yo!

1096
00:49:06,344 --> 00:49:08,344
Why you moving like that?
Is it the bra?

1097
00:49:08,346 --> 00:49:10,579
'Cause if... if it's the bra,
just take it off.

1098
00:49:10,581 --> 00:49:11,981
You don't need it anyways.

1099
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:19,622
What?

1100
00:49:22,193 --> 00:49:25,094
What are you doing?
We just started.

1101
00:49:25,096 --> 00:49:27,863
Is your boy okay?
Why does he wear a bra?

1102
00:49:27,865 --> 00:49:29,999
She's a girl.

1103
00:49:31,568 --> 00:49:33,636
You suck.

1104
00:49:33,638 --> 00:49:36,906
♪ You suck, you suck, you suck,
you suck, you suck, you suck ♪

1105
00:49:40,845 --> 00:49:44,513
♪ Your boy has no skills ♪

1106
00:49:44,515 --> 00:49:46,349
♪ you schooled
by a little girl ♪

1107
00:49:46,351 --> 00:49:48,050
♪ you suck, you suck, you suck ♪

1108
00:49:58,729 --> 00:50:00,896
Tyler, slow down!

1109
00:50:00,898 --> 00:50:02,164
Come on, mom!

1110
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:03,699
We're going four Miles
per hour.

1111
00:50:03,701 --> 00:50:06,736
That's plenty fast enough.
Fast and safe.

1112
00:50:06,738 --> 00:50:08,004
Miss Palmer!

1113
00:50:08,006 --> 00:50:09,939
It's okay to go fast.

1114
00:50:09,941 --> 00:50:11,607
Oh, okay, mfana.

1115
00:50:11,609 --> 00:50:13,242
Watch me!

1116
00:50:13,244 --> 00:50:15,644
Whee!

1117
00:50:15,646 --> 00:50:17,079
You're going the wrong way!

1118
00:50:17,081 --> 00:50:18,614
Watch out, grandma!

1119
00:50:18,616 --> 00:50:21,684
Aaah!

1120
00:50:21,686 --> 00:50:23,386
My bad.

1121
00:50:23,388 --> 00:50:27,857
The blending process
is really going well for us.

1122
00:50:27,859 --> 00:50:29,492
My husband's 13-year-old

1123
00:50:29,494 --> 00:50:32,528
still has some hatred issues
towards me.

1124
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:35,231
But it is becoming
less physical.

1125
00:50:35,233 --> 00:50:36,465
So it's a start.

1126
00:50:36,467 --> 00:50:39,168
- That's great.
- Good for you.

1127
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:40,669
Yeah. I woke up this morning

1128
00:50:40,671 --> 00:50:43,105
with a pillow pressed
against my face.

1129
00:50:43,107 --> 00:50:45,441
But I could sense some guilt
afterwards.

1130
00:50:45,443 --> 00:50:47,143
So that's progress.
Yeah.

1131
00:50:47,145 --> 00:50:48,477
Hang in there, ladies.

1132
00:50:48,479 --> 00:50:50,479
There's a light at the end
of the tunnel.

1133
00:50:50,481 --> 00:50:54,683
This little angel here is
finally starting to think of me

1134
00:50:54,685 --> 00:50:55,818
as her second mom.

1135
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:58,921
Not just her former
gymnastics teacher.

1136
00:50:58,923 --> 00:51:00,723
Wha-what are you drawing,
honey?

1137
00:51:00,725 --> 00:51:03,292
It's a picture of elephants
stomping on your head

1138
00:51:03,294 --> 00:51:04,660
and making you dead.

1139
00:51:06,296 --> 00:51:08,064
Stop it.

1140
00:51:09,667 --> 00:51:10,766
Don't worry.

1141
00:51:10,768 --> 00:51:12,401
What happens in Africa
stays in Africa.

1142
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:15,004
Bump my fist?

1143
00:51:15,006 --> 00:51:17,573
Jim's so funny.

1144
00:51:17,575 --> 00:51:18,841
Yeah.

1145
00:51:31,756 --> 00:51:35,491
My head is boiling, mom.

1146
00:51:35,493 --> 00:51:37,059
Get it off.
I'm trying.

1147
00:51:37,061 --> 00:51:39,195
Why did you tie it
with so many knots?

1148
00:51:39,197 --> 00:51:40,596
'Cause I didn't want it
to come flying off.

1149
00:51:40,598 --> 00:51:43,666
Oh, my God!
What happened to her face?

1150
00:51:43,668 --> 00:51:45,468
I painted it.
Sh-she's a kitty cat.

1151
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:47,169
Are you wearing
eye shadow?

1152
00:51:47,171 --> 00:51:50,506
I made daddy a princess,
but he washed the paint off.

1153
00:51:50,508 --> 00:51:51,874
Well, not all the way off

1154
00:51:51,876 --> 00:51:53,509
because he looks a little
like lady gaga.

1155
00:51:53,511 --> 00:51:55,444
Why is this kid
wearing a helmet?

1156
00:51:55,446 --> 00:51:57,880
Are you carryin' him to bed
again or somethin'?

1157
00:51:57,882 --> 00:52:00,116
No, I tied the chin strap
too many times.

1158
00:52:00,118 --> 00:52:01,584
It's...
I can't get it off.

1159
00:52:01,586 --> 00:52:04,153
Best thing about workin'
at a sporting goods store...

1160
00:52:04,155 --> 00:52:05,621
Swiss army knives.

1161
00:52:05,623 --> 00:52:08,224
Just... just be careful.
I'll go easy.

1162
00:52:08,226 --> 00:52:10,326
Aah!
Oh!

1163
00:52:10,328 --> 00:52:12,628
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
Thank you.
Thanks.

1164
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:14,997
Sure.
Daddy, I gotta go
to the bathroom.

1165
00:52:14,999 --> 00:52:17,233
You do? Okay.
Can she take me?

1166
00:52:17,235 --> 00:52:19,401
Umm, she's got, uh,
her own life to live.

1167
00:52:19,403 --> 00:52:21,303
What do you gotta do?
One or two?

1168
00:52:21,305 --> 00:52:22,404
Number one.

1169
00:52:22,406 --> 00:52:24,006
I can handle this.

1170
00:52:24,008 --> 00:52:25,407
Okay.

1171
00:52:25,409 --> 00:52:27,776
Will you watch him?
And I mean watch him.

1172
00:52:27,778 --> 00:52:30,346
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got it, home slice.

1173
00:52:30,348 --> 00:52:31,714
Okay.
For sure.

1174
00:52:31,716 --> 00:52:32,781
What's number one again?

1175
00:52:32,783 --> 00:52:36,185
Um, it's, uh...
it's a pee-pee.

1176
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:40,489
And sometimes,
he wipes too hard.

1177
00:52:40,491 --> 00:52:42,992
Aw, I'm sure
he doesn't mean to.

1178
00:52:42,994 --> 00:52:44,460
No, he's a good daddy.

1179
00:52:44,462 --> 00:52:46,862
He just doesn't have
a bagina.

1180
00:52:48,132 --> 00:52:50,633
Okay, honey.
Let's wash your hands.

1181
00:52:51,669 --> 00:52:53,602
He's a bad daddy!

1182
00:52:53,604 --> 00:52:56,739
He made me look like
the walking dead!

1183
00:52:56,741 --> 00:52:58,474
Oh, no!

1184
00:52:58,476 --> 00:52:59,476
Oh.

1185
00:52:59,477 --> 00:53:03,212
Okay.
All right.

1186
00:53:03,214 --> 00:53:06,148
Let's see what we have
in the magic bag here.

1187
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:09,151
Oh, perfect.

1188
00:53:09,153 --> 00:53:11,654
All right.
LA-da-da!

1189
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:15,191
You're pretty.

1190
00:53:15,193 --> 00:53:18,160
You're prettier.

1191
00:53:18,162 --> 00:53:20,162
I said you are.

1192
00:53:20,164 --> 00:53:23,632
Shut up
and let me do your makeup.

1193
00:53:24,669 --> 00:53:26,602
Don't worry.
They're around.

1194
00:53:26,604 --> 00:53:28,337
Oh, I'm not worried.

1195
00:53:28,339 --> 00:53:30,072
Maybe that's
where they are.

1196
00:53:31,175 --> 00:53:32,241
Aw, yeah!

1197
00:53:32,243 --> 00:53:34,810
Whoo! Yeah!

1198
00:53:34,812 --> 00:53:36,378
Tyler?

1199
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:38,480
Hold on, now!
Excuse me.

1200
00:53:38,482 --> 00:53:40,549
Hold on, big time!

1201
00:53:40,551 --> 00:53:44,153
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1202
00:53:45,423 --> 00:53:47,456
Oh! Oh, my God!
I'm gonna kill him.

1203
00:53:48,926 --> 00:53:55,331
Yeah, baby! Hold on, now!
Whoa! Whoa! Easy, homey, easy!

1204
00:53:55,333 --> 00:53:59,702
Tyler! Get off that dodo bird
right now!

1205
00:53:59,704 --> 00:54:01,604
Oh, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa.
Everything's fine.

1206
00:54:01,606 --> 00:54:03,973
The safety instructor's
on top of it.

1207
00:54:08,479 --> 00:54:10,879
Look at me, mom!
I'm a cowboy!

1208
00:54:10,881 --> 00:54:13,949
Well, partner, I bet I can
stay on longer than you!

1209
00:54:13,951 --> 00:54:15,217
It's on, sheriff.

1210
00:54:15,219 --> 00:54:17,286
No "longer"! No "staying"!

1211
00:54:18,656 --> 00:54:21,090
I can't be beat!
I can't hear you!

1212
00:54:21,092 --> 00:54:22,291
You're going down!

1213
00:54:22,293 --> 00:54:24,159
I'm never gonna fall off!
Never!

1214
00:54:25,696 --> 00:54:29,465
Yeah! Aw, shut up! Whoo!

1215
00:54:29,467 --> 00:54:31,800
Whoo! One hand, mama!
Whoo!

1216
00:54:35,806 --> 00:54:36,972
Good!

1217
00:54:36,974 --> 00:54:38,540
Yes! I win!

1218
00:54:38,542 --> 00:54:40,909
I'm the king of Africa!

1219
00:54:40,911 --> 00:54:44,346
Tyler!

1220
00:54:47,952 --> 00:54:49,418
A winner!

1221
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:51,120
Are you kidding me?

1222
00:54:51,122 --> 00:54:53,389
Yee-haw! Yee-haw!

1223
00:54:53,391 --> 00:54:56,425
Wow. Whoooo, boom!

1224
00:54:56,427 --> 00:54:57,693
You're a moron, okay?

1225
00:54:57,695 --> 00:54:59,395
Because he could've
broken his neck!

1226
00:54:59,397 --> 00:55:01,030
Mom, mom, mom!
Did you see that?

1227
00:55:01,032 --> 00:55:03,666
I stuck the landing
and did the bull dance.

1228
00:55:03,668 --> 00:55:05,234
Yes! I saw it and I just...
you can't...

1229
00:55:05,236 --> 00:55:07,469
thank you so much for taking me
on this trip, mom.

1230
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:09,538
This is the best day of my life!

1231
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:12,608
Okay.
Great! Oh, good! Oh good.

1232
00:55:12,610 --> 00:55:13,842
I love you so much.

1233
00:55:13,844 --> 00:55:16,111
I'm so glad
you're having fun.

1234
00:55:16,113 --> 00:55:18,914
Awww.
You're welcome.

1235
00:55:18,916 --> 00:55:20,849
Thank you so much.

1236
00:55:20,851 --> 00:55:23,419
Why you flipping
my dad off?
Huh? I'm not.

1237
00:55:23,421 --> 00:55:25,921
♪ 2 o'clock
on a Friday mornin' ♪

1238
00:55:25,923 --> 00:55:27,189

yo! Check out white girl

1241
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:33,696
Am I right, my brothers?

1242
00:55:33,698 --> 00:55:35,397
Woot-woot!

1243
00:55:41,638 --> 00:55:44,373
I can't believe
your dad's into my mom.

1244
00:55:44,375 --> 00:55:46,375
He doesn't like her.
She's into him.

1245
00:55:46,377 --> 00:55:48,644
No way. He's goofy
and flabby all over.

1246
00:55:48,646 --> 00:55:50,879
My mom's gorgeous
with a rocking body.

1247
00:55:50,881 --> 00:55:52,981
Hey, hey, that's sick, man.

1248
00:55:52,983 --> 00:55:54,850
That was out of context!

1249
00:55:54,852 --> 00:55:56,385
Was it?

1250
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:26,348
You know, you should just
go talk to him,

1251
00:56:26,350 --> 00:56:28,283
because he probably
won't bite.

1252
00:56:28,285 --> 00:56:31,320
Oh!
No, no. I-I can't.

1253
00:56:31,322 --> 00:56:33,555
Got a boyfriend
back at home?

1254
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:35,324
Please.
All the guys at my school

1255
00:56:35,326 --> 00:56:37,092
pretty much assume
I'm a lesbian.

1256
00:56:37,094 --> 00:56:38,961
And not the hot kind.

1257
00:56:38,963 --> 00:56:42,297
Well,
have you ever considered,

1258
00:56:42,299 --> 00:56:45,267
say, like... Changing
your hairstyle?

1259
00:56:45,269 --> 00:56:46,702
Our barber
only really knows

1260
00:56:46,704 --> 00:56:48,771
how to do this
and crew cuts, so...

1261
00:56:48,773 --> 00:56:49,705
A barber?

1262
00:56:49,707 --> 00:56:52,441
Like the kind
with a pole outside?

1263
00:56:52,443 --> 00:56:54,143
He cut
our grandfather's hair.

1264
00:56:54,145 --> 00:56:56,478
He cuts my dad's hair and...
Now he cuts our hair.

1265
00:56:57,615 --> 00:56:59,681
May I just...?

1266
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:02,885
Yep.

1267
00:57:04,788 --> 00:57:09,057
You have such
a beautiful face.

1268
00:57:11,629 --> 00:57:13,095
You know, it's funny

1269
00:57:13,097 --> 00:57:15,998
because I was actually
on my way to the salon.

1270
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,867
Do you wanna come
check it out with me?

1271
00:57:18,869 --> 00:57:20,803
For what?

1272
00:57:20,805 --> 00:57:25,874
For a hairdo... For a girl...
In this century.

1273
00:57:25,876 --> 00:57:29,478
I-I would, but, um,
I-I'd have to ask my dad

1274
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:30,612
for the money and...

1275
00:57:30,614 --> 00:57:32,281
No. N-n-no.
I don't...

1276
00:57:32,283 --> 00:57:33,415
it's on me.

1277
00:57:33,417 --> 00:57:35,851
Really?

1278
00:57:35,853 --> 00:57:38,620
It would make me
so happy.

1279
00:57:38,622 --> 00:57:40,622
Because I don't get to do this
with my boys.

1280
00:57:40,624 --> 00:57:42,090
Come on, prince Valiant.

1281
00:57:42,092 --> 00:57:45,461
I don't know
who that is, but okay.

1282
00:57:45,463 --> 00:57:47,429
Okay.

1283
00:57:47,431 --> 00:57:51,133
Where do you buy
your clothes?

1284
00:57:51,135 --> 00:57:53,669
Oh, dad gets most
of our clothes from work.

1285
00:57:53,671 --> 00:57:55,804
Oh, then I guess
we should be grateful

1286
00:57:55,806 --> 00:57:57,539
he doesn't work
at Hooters.

1287
00:57:57,541 --> 00:57:59,575
No, my mom
worked at Hooters.

1288
00:57:59,577 --> 00:58:01,777
She what?

1289
00:58:01,779 --> 00:58:04,012
Oh, my mom.
She used to work at Hooters.

1290
00:58:04,014 --> 00:58:06,448
She managed the one
over on lake street.

1291
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:10,619
Oh.

1292
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:20,629
So then he gets down on one knee
and proposes.

1293
00:58:20,631 --> 00:58:22,531
Right in the middle
of kickboxing class.

1294
00:58:24,101 --> 00:58:27,069
He's lucky he didn't get kicked
in the nuts.
Ooh.

1295
00:58:27,071 --> 00:58:29,071
Oh, my nuts!

1296
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:32,007
ESPN.

1297
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:34,977
This is the best passion fruit
I've ever tasted.

1298
00:58:34,979 --> 00:58:36,044
Try it.

1299
00:58:36,046 --> 00:58:39,081
And I got some
for your mom too.

1300
00:58:39,083 --> 00:58:41,049
Thank you.

1301
00:58:41,051 --> 00:58:43,085
You're welcome.

1302
00:58:43,087 --> 00:58:44,753
So how'd you two
sexicans meet?

1303
00:58:44,755 --> 00:58:46,421
Yeah! Hittin' 'em
with the hard questions.

1304
00:58:46,423 --> 00:58:47,456
I like it.

1305
00:58:47,458 --> 00:58:49,458
Well, we met on a blind date.

1306
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:50,592
Ugh.
Huh.

1307
00:58:50,594 --> 00:58:52,661
Those are the worst.
Oh.

1308
00:58:52,663 --> 00:58:54,897
I've been on ten blind dates
in my life.

1309
00:58:54,899 --> 00:58:56,532
All fatties.
Ten for ten.

1310
00:58:56,534 --> 00:58:58,100
All fatties.

1311
00:58:59,336 --> 00:59:01,370
No offense, Jim.

1312
00:59:01,372 --> 00:59:03,505
What?

1313
00:59:03,507 --> 00:59:05,340
So what happened?
Where'd he take you?

1314
00:59:05,342 --> 00:59:08,010
Actually... Hooters.

1315
00:59:08,012 --> 00:59:08,944
Here we go.

1316
00:59:08,946 --> 00:59:11,747
Which was
wonderful service,

1317
00:59:11,749 --> 00:59:14,516
nice people... Really great.

1318
00:59:14,518 --> 00:59:18,520
Aw, how romantic.

1319
00:59:18,522 --> 00:59:20,188
Oh.

1320
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:22,124
Aw, everyone's shimmying now.

1321
00:59:22,126 --> 00:59:24,326
Shimmy, shimmy, shimmy.

1322
00:59:24,328 --> 00:59:25,527
Why you no shimmy, Jimmy?

1323
00:59:25,529 --> 00:59:28,764
Shimmy. Jim?

What happened to Larry?

1333
01:00:11,208 --> 01:00:12,808
I'm right here, dad.

1334
01:00:12,810 --> 01:00:18,647
Why w-w-were the, uh...
how did this, uh...

1335
01:00:18,649 --> 01:00:20,849
w-what's happening
right now?

1336
01:00:20,851 --> 01:00:24,419
Um, well, Lauren gave me
her salon appointment...

1337
01:00:24,421 --> 01:00:26,788
Uh-huh.
...And they put in
hair extensions

1338
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:28,023
and makeup

1339
01:00:28,025 --> 01:00:30,025
and she even told them
how to style it

1340
01:00:30,027 --> 01:00:33,161
and what to do,
what not to do.

1341
01:00:33,163 --> 01:00:35,631
She was pretty amazing.

1342
01:00:35,633 --> 01:00:38,300
She was amazing, huh?

1343
01:00:38,302 --> 01:00:41,403
Do you want to go get some Sushi
from the bar?

1344
01:00:41,405 --> 01:00:43,105
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Easy, scarecrow!

1345
01:00:43,107 --> 01:00:44,039
She's gotta bulk up!

1346
01:00:44,041 --> 01:00:47,643
Pork chops!
Lamb chops! Tri-tip!

1347
01:00:47,645 --> 01:00:49,845
Uh...

1348
01:00:49,847 --> 01:00:51,413
Let's go get our beef on?

1349
01:00:51,415 --> 01:00:54,683
Yeah?

1350
01:00:56,086 --> 01:00:58,186
Uh-oh. I think someone new
came to dinner.

1351
01:00:58,188 --> 01:01:01,189
A flying baby
named cupid.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

1352
01:01:01,191 --> 01:01:02,791
Oh, cu-ping!

1353
01:01:02,793 --> 01:01:05,560
Aw! You got me!

1354
01:01:08,999 --> 01:01:10,666
Now we're both in love.

1355
01:01:14,438 --> 01:01:15,904
What's the matter?

1356
01:01:15,906 --> 01:01:18,040
What's the matter?

1357
01:01:18,042 --> 01:01:19,741
I just looked at my daughter,

1358
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:21,777
and I didn't really
recognize her.

1359
01:01:21,779 --> 01:01:23,578
Kinda threw me off for a minute.

1360
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:25,280
Well, she's 15,
you know?

1361
01:01:25,282 --> 01:01:27,949
She's bound to grow up
at some point.

1362
01:01:27,951 --> 01:01:29,384
I know.
Call me crazy,

1363
01:01:29,386 --> 01:01:32,354
I just thought maybe
that would be my decision

1364
01:01:32,356 --> 01:01:33,555
'cause she's my kid!

1365
01:01:33,557 --> 01:01:36,591
Okay!
Awkward moment.

1366
01:01:36,593 --> 01:01:37,793
Uncomfortable. Tension.

1367
01:01:37,795 --> 01:01:39,327
I'm leavin' the table.
Who's with me?

1368
01:01:39,329 --> 01:01:42,097
Me.
Me, me, me.
I'm going.
Fine.

1369
01:01:42,099 --> 01:01:46,368
Wow. Whoa. I just...
can I ask ya?

1370
01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:49,871
What made you think
you could tart up my daughter

1371
01:01:49,873 --> 01:01:51,506
without my permission?

1372
01:01:51,508 --> 01:01:55,110
You're right.
I'm sorry.

1373
01:01:55,112 --> 01:01:55,977
I am.

1374
01:01:55,979 --> 01:01:57,312
I just find it hypocritical

1375
01:01:57,314 --> 01:01:59,414
from someone
who nearly killed my son.

1376
01:01:59,416 --> 01:02:01,349
Oh, so it was getting even?
Is that it?

1377
01:02:01,351 --> 01:02:03,185
No, it's not getting even,
but I just...

1378
01:02:03,187 --> 01:02:04,019
oh, my God.

1379
01:02:04,021 --> 01:02:05,921
She's beautiful.
Right.

1380
01:02:05,923 --> 01:02:08,790
With that pageboy prince Valiant
haircut you gave her

1381
01:02:08,792 --> 01:02:10,926
and the tracksuit,
are you kidding me?!

1382
01:02:10,928 --> 01:02:13,095
She looked very nice
with that haircut.

1383
01:02:13,097 --> 01:02:15,931
Dying on the inside
to come out!

1384
01:02:15,933 --> 01:02:18,567
Her mother was tomboyish
at her age,

1385
01:02:18,569 --> 01:02:21,236
and that was fine
with me.

1386
01:02:21,238 --> 01:02:23,705
You knew your wife
when she was 15?

1387
01:02:23,707 --> 01:02:25,874
I knew my wife
when I was 13.

1388
01:02:25,876 --> 01:02:27,242
I had a crush on her.

1389
01:02:27,244 --> 01:02:29,978
I have no idea
why she liked me back.

1390
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:32,180
I was 90% goofy
and 10% loser.

1391
01:02:32,182 --> 01:02:38,320
Well, I was 60% urkel
and 40% screech.

1392
01:02:38,322 --> 01:02:40,756
If I didn't have braces,

1393
01:02:40,758 --> 01:02:42,724
my teeth would be hitting you
right now.

1394
01:02:49,031 --> 01:02:51,333
I'm sorry
I yelled at you.

1395
01:02:51,335 --> 01:02:52,467
I feel like a jerk

1396
01:02:52,469 --> 01:02:54,336
because I put your kid
on a gooney bird

1397
01:02:54,338 --> 01:02:56,705
and I didn't ask your permission
and, and, uh...

1398
01:02:56,707 --> 01:02:58,507
no, but listen.
You're right.

1399
01:03:00,376 --> 01:03:03,211
I need to let go of the reins
a little bit.

1400
01:03:03,213 --> 01:03:09,251
I just want to say on behalf
of thathoo how happy we are

1401
01:03:09,253 --> 01:03:13,855

1402
01:03:13,857 --> 01:03:15,490
No, we're not blending.

1403
01:03:15,492 --> 01:03:17,259
We were just having
a conversation.

1404
01:03:17,261 --> 01:03:19,461

so it is being cared for

01:05:58,922 --> 01:06:00,755
Yeah, baby!

1435
01:06:00,757 --> 01:06:01,890
No!

1436
01:06:01,892 --> 01:06:04,626
You can do it, mom!

1437
01:06:04,628 --> 01:06:06,294
Go Lauren! Go Lauren!

1438
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:07,762
Whoa!

1439
01:06:27,450 --> 01:06:30,085
Yeah!

1440
01:06:40,563 --> 01:06:43,531
Emotional.
Jesus.

1441
01:06:43,533 --> 01:06:45,033
Time passing. Changes.

1442
01:06:45,035 --> 01:06:47,802
It's... it's... it's hard.

1443
01:06:47,804 --> 01:06:49,471
You gotta let it go.

1444
01:06:49,473 --> 01:06:51,773
Turning the page.
Movin' on.

1445
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:54,809
She was a little kid
just a...

1446
01:06:54,811 --> 01:06:56,277
processing it.
Accepting it.

1447
01:06:56,279 --> 01:06:57,912
Mm-hmm.
The circle of life.

1448
01:06:57,914 --> 01:06:59,247
Painful, though.

1449
01:06:59,249 --> 01:07:00,482
It hurts, right?

1450
01:07:00,484 --> 01:07:02,851
Nah. Not for me.
I got a boy.

1451
01:07:02,853 --> 01:07:04,953
But you're
in the shithouse.

1452
01:07:04,955 --> 01:07:06,554
Thanks.

1453
01:07:07,923 --> 01:07:11,426
Whoo! Ha! The view is splendid!

1454
01:07:11,428 --> 01:07:15,864
Ubani omunye ozayo?
Which mean "who's next?"!

1455
01:07:15,866 --> 01:07:17,032
Please, mom?!

1456
01:07:17,034 --> 01:07:19,601
What? That?
Are you crazy? No.

1457
01:07:19,603 --> 01:07:21,269
If mfana can do it,
I could do it.

1458
01:07:21,271 --> 01:07:22,670
It's totally safe.

1459
01:07:22,672 --> 01:07:26,708
There is no way I'm going to
let you do that.

1460
01:07:26,710 --> 01:07:33,214
Unless I try it first and
make sure you can handle it.

1461
01:07:33,216 --> 01:07:36,217
Yeah.
Yes! Yeah!

1462
01:07:36,219 --> 01:07:38,520
Cool!
Your mom is gonna do it.

1463
01:07:39,822 --> 01:07:42,957
You have nothing to worry about.
You are in tight.

1464
01:07:42,959 --> 01:07:44,692
You got 50-gauge
webbing here.

1465
01:07:44,694 --> 01:07:48,096
Possibly malaria is the only
thing you gotta think about.

1466
01:07:48,098 --> 01:07:50,331
Don't swallow anything
weird up there.

1467
01:07:50,333 --> 01:07:52,834
Okay. What happens if, like,
I wanna signal for help,

1468
01:07:52,836 --> 01:07:56,604
or, uh, like, if I decide to
change my mind!

1469
01:07:56,606 --> 01:07:57,872
Oh, yeah, baby!

1470
01:07:57,874 --> 01:07:59,541
You look good!
Oh, my God!

1471
01:07:59,543 --> 01:08:01,443
I change my mind!
I change my mind!

1472
01:08:01,445 --> 01:08:03,645
That's awesome!

1473
01:08:03,647 --> 01:08:06,347
Aah! Aah! Ah...

1474
01:08:06,349 --> 01:08:07,649
Oh!

1475
01:08:07,651 --> 01:08:12,053
Oh! Wow!

1476
01:08:12,055 --> 01:08:15,323
Oh, my God!

1477
01:08:15,325 --> 01:08:17,525
It's beautiful!

1478
01:08:17,527 --> 01:08:19,861
Go, mama, go!

1479
01:08:19,863 --> 01:08:21,329
Whoo!
Oh! Oh!

1480
01:08:21,331 --> 01:08:23,131
There are giraffes!

1481
01:08:23,133 --> 01:08:25,600
Jim, there are giraffes
right there!

1482
01:08:25,602 --> 01:08:26,434
I can see them!

1483
01:08:26,436 --> 01:08:29,037
Well, say hello for me!

1484
01:08:30,607 --> 01:08:32,006
Oh, wow!

1485
01:08:32,008 --> 01:08:36,811
Oh, this is so pretty!

1486
01:08:38,048 --> 01:08:41,616
Oh, my God!
Elephants! Elephants!

1487
01:08:41,618 --> 01:08:43,084
Oh!

1488
01:08:45,922 --> 01:08:48,256
Thatta girl!

1489
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:53,061
Why is she screaming?

1490
01:08:53,063 --> 01:08:55,663
She's not screaming.
She's howling.

1491
01:08:55,665 --> 01:08:56,898
She's having fun.

1492
01:09:01,071 --> 01:09:03,371
Lookin' good up there,
baby!

1493
01:09:03,373 --> 01:09:07,775
Fly, Mrs. thorpopolis!
Fly like the wind!

1494
01:09:09,079 --> 01:09:13,081
Tyler!
You've gotta try this!

1495
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:18,686
Why you slowing down?!

1496
01:09:18,688 --> 01:09:20,388
We're out of gas.

1497
01:09:20,390 --> 01:09:21,890
You're out of gas?!
What does that mean?!

1498
01:09:21,892 --> 01:09:25,360
Uh, we used to have gas.
But now we're out.

1499
01:09:25,362 --> 01:09:26,928
Oh!

1500
01:09:26,930 --> 01:09:29,097
Oh! Oh, my God!

1501
01:09:29,099 --> 01:09:32,700
What's happening?
Jim!

1502
01:09:32,702 --> 01:09:34,702
We're out of gas!

1503
01:09:34,704 --> 01:09:36,004
What?!

1504
01:09:36,006 --> 01:09:37,105
Oh, no.
Oh.

1505
01:09:37,107 --> 01:09:38,706
Oh, my God! No!

1506
01:09:38,708 --> 01:09:39,974
This is all your fault!

1507
01:09:39,976 --> 01:09:42,110
Don't worry! My dad's gonna
come up with a plan!

1508
01:09:42,112 --> 01:09:43,444
What's the plan?!

1509
01:09:43,446 --> 01:09:45,580
Look for a gas station.

1510
01:09:45,582 --> 01:09:46,748
You suck.

1511
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:48,983
Why did I let you talk me
into this?!

1512
01:09:48,985 --> 01:09:50,552
Listen to me!

1513
01:09:50,554 --> 01:09:55,123
When you get close to the
ground, start running fast!

1514
01:09:55,125 --> 01:09:57,992
I have the legs
of a corgi dog!

1515
01:09:57,994 --> 01:10:00,028
It doesn't matter
right now!

1516
01:10:00,030 --> 01:10:01,529
Move those little babies!

1517
01:10:01,531 --> 01:10:05,200
You cannot let your kids
see you die like this!

1518
01:10:07,070 --> 01:10:08,136
Go! Go!

1519
01:10:08,138 --> 01:10:10,171
Go! Go!

1520
01:10:10,173 --> 01:10:12,740
Now!
Get those legs goin'!

1521
01:10:13,543 --> 01:10:17,378
Oh, my God!
Rhino!

1522
01:10:19,115 --> 01:10:22,083
No!!!
Spread 'em!

1523
01:10:22,085 --> 01:10:23,151
Oh, my God!

1524
01:10:23,153 --> 01:10:25,153
Spread the legs!

1525
01:10:25,155 --> 01:10:27,121
Her bagina!

1526
01:10:27,123 --> 01:10:29,390
Ow!

1527
01:10:31,727 --> 01:10:33,094
Yeah!

1528
01:10:37,534 --> 01:10:39,601
Go, go, go, go, go!
Dad!

1529
01:11:04,327 --> 01:11:05,893
Whew!

1530
01:11:09,632 --> 01:11:11,532
Ah.

1531
01:11:11,534 --> 01:11:15,503
I didn't have you pegged
for the massage type of guy.

1532
01:11:15,505 --> 01:11:17,672
It's the first massage
I'll ever do in my life.

1533
01:11:17,674 --> 01:11:18,840
I have to.

1534
01:11:18,842 --> 01:11:21,476
To see if they can rub
my pancreas out of my neck.

1535
01:11:21,478 --> 01:11:23,511
My God.
You're welcome, by the way.

1536
01:11:23,513 --> 01:11:25,847
For what?

1537
01:11:25,849 --> 01:11:28,116
"For what?"
For saving you.

1538
01:11:28,118 --> 01:11:29,617
You didn't save me.

1539
01:11:29,619 --> 01:11:32,186
You told me
to keep running.
Oh, my God. I did.

1540
01:11:32,188 --> 01:11:33,354
Why didn't you catch me?

1541
01:11:33,356 --> 01:11:34,956
I was supposed
to catch you?

1542
01:11:34,958 --> 01:11:36,224
Who am I, Batman?

1543
01:11:36,226 --> 01:11:37,626
Comin' at me like
700 Miles an hour.

1544
01:11:37,627 --> 01:11:40,194
You know, you're weighin'
about a buck fifty.

1545
01:11:40,196 --> 01:11:42,430
The inertia would rip
my arms off my body.

1546
01:11:42,432 --> 01:11:44,699
Yes. That's me.
I weigh a buck fifty.

1547
01:11:44,701 --> 01:11:46,901
If I'm holding
your left ass cheek.

1548
01:11:46,903 --> 01:11:49,537
I don't know
what women weigh.

1549
01:11:49,539 --> 01:11:51,105
You don't know anything.

1550
01:11:51,107 --> 01:11:52,840
Mm-hmm.
Have a nice massage.

1551
01:11:52,842 --> 01:11:53,875
We'll see.

1552
01:11:53,877 --> 01:11:55,376
All right.

1553
01:11:55,378 --> 01:11:58,613
Now do the same on your partner
while making sure to continue

1554
01:11:58,615 --> 01:12:01,215
to look deeply
into each others' eyes.

1555
01:12:05,621 --> 01:12:06,621
What is this?

1556
01:12:06,623 --> 01:12:08,022
A scene out
of "the doors"?

1557
01:12:08,024 --> 01:12:10,558
I-I-I don't know.
Uh-uh, I... ma'am?

1558
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:13,695
Yeah.
I-I booked a massage.

1559
01:12:13,697 --> 01:12:16,731
Yes. You've booked for
the art of couples massage.

1560
01:12:16,733 --> 01:12:20,368
Oh! Actually there was an
avalanche in my yard, so I-I...
I just got a call from my
babysitter and there's...

1561
01:12:20,370 --> 01:12:21,703
...was comin' to my...
...An emer...

1562
01:12:21,705 --> 01:12:24,706
come on! This is exactly
what you guys need.

1563
01:12:24,708 --> 01:12:27,308
We'll form a massage train.
I'll be the caboose.

1564
01:12:27,310 --> 01:12:28,609
Unacceptable.

1565
01:12:28,611 --> 01:12:30,378
I'm jokin'.

1566
01:12:33,249 --> 01:12:34,615
Join us.

1567
01:12:34,617 --> 01:12:36,184
No, no, ma'am, seriously...
I'm so good. I...

1568
01:12:36,186 --> 01:12:38,252
I think you should.
This way.

1569
01:12:38,254 --> 01:12:40,688
And... There you go.

1570
01:12:40,690 --> 01:12:42,290
Oh, my God.
Ow!

1571
01:12:42,292 --> 01:12:43,958
Like that. There.
I... I guess.

1572
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:45,660
Okay!

1573
01:12:45,662 --> 01:12:50,164
Let's, uh, loosen things up
by stroking your lover's neck.

1574
01:12:50,166 --> 01:12:51,833
Okay.

1575
01:12:51,835 --> 01:12:54,702
Come on, now.
Don't be bashful.

1576
01:12:54,704 --> 01:12:57,572
Give yourself over
to the pleasure

1577
01:12:57,574 --> 01:12:59,941
of your loving partner's touch.

1578
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:04,545
Yeah.

1579
01:13:07,584 --> 01:13:09,884
Hello.
How are you?

1580
01:13:12,955 --> 01:13:15,323
Ow.

1581
01:13:15,325 --> 01:13:16,657
Remember to keep
the touch soft, uh?

1582
01:13:16,659 --> 01:13:19,360
Lightly brush your fingers
against her skin.

1583
01:13:19,362 --> 01:13:22,296
It's so...

1584
01:13:22,298 --> 01:13:23,698
oh, God!
What's happening?!

1585
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:25,767
Is there a bug on me?!
No.

1586
01:13:25,769 --> 01:13:27,869
There's no bug.
I was just...

1587
01:13:27,871 --> 01:13:31,606
Tryin' to get...
Some skin, like she said.

1588
01:13:31,608 --> 01:13:33,174
Well, that hurts
the jugular.

1589
01:13:33,176 --> 01:13:34,409
I won't do it.
I'm sorry.

1590
01:13:34,411 --> 01:13:39,213
I-I-I don't know...
How to give you a...

1591
01:13:46,355 --> 01:13:48,389
Okay, so...

1592
01:13:48,391 --> 01:13:50,191
There you go.
Oh.

1593
01:13:50,193 --> 01:13:52,527
That's actually
really nice.

1594
01:13:52,529 --> 01:13:54,362
Good.

1595
01:13:54,364 --> 01:13:55,897
Oh, God.

1596
01:13:55,899 --> 01:13:57,432
Oh.

1597
01:13:57,434 --> 01:13:58,966
I feel like I'm relaxing.

1598
01:13:58,968 --> 01:14:01,369
It's just...
oh, it's wonderful.

1599
01:14:01,371 --> 01:14:02,737
Excuse me.

1600
01:14:02,739 --> 01:14:04,839
Am I gonna get
some sorta rub action here

1601
01:14:04,841 --> 01:14:07,708
or does the guy do all the work
in Africa?

1602
01:14:07,710 --> 01:14:09,444
Very funny, Mr. moptopolis.

1603
01:14:09,446 --> 01:14:11,646
But he's right.

1604
01:14:11,648 --> 01:14:14,015
Ladies, it's time for you
to join in.

1605
01:14:14,017 --> 01:14:17,919
As your partner moves down
to your shoulders,

1606
01:14:17,921 --> 01:14:20,254
reach out and touch his ears.

1607
01:14:20,256 --> 01:14:24,692
Gently rub the lobes between
your thumb and index finger

1608
01:14:24,694 --> 01:14:27,995
as if you were rubbing
the morning dew

1609
01:14:27,997 --> 01:14:29,464
off a flower petal.

1610
01:14:29,466 --> 01:14:30,665
Uh-huh.

1611
01:14:30,667 --> 01:14:32,834
Are these
your flower petals?

1612
01:14:32,836 --> 01:14:34,001
Yes.
Now rub the dew.

1613
01:14:34,003 --> 01:14:35,470
Do the dew.

1614
01:14:35,472 --> 01:14:37,705
I'd be doing you
a really big favor

1615
01:14:37,707 --> 01:14:40,608
if I just yanked these
goofy things right off.

1616
01:14:40,610 --> 01:14:42,910
Oh, just sh-sh-shut up,
schlumpy shoulders.

1617
01:14:42,912 --> 01:14:44,378
I do have
schlumpy shoulders.

1618
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:45,746
No, you don't.
They're very nice.

1619
01:14:45,748 --> 01:14:46,881
They're very nice.
I do.

1620
01:14:46,883 --> 01:14:48,516
But you know what helps
if... if y...

1621
01:14:48,518 --> 01:14:49,951
if you need to work
on your posture?

1622
01:14:49,953 --> 01:14:51,686
Here, just lift your arms
a little bit.

1623
01:14:51,688 --> 01:14:53,588
Watch, I'll show you.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

1624
01:14:53,590 --> 01:14:54,856
All right.
Aah!

1625
01:14:56,292 --> 01:14:58,826
God. Feels very good.

1626
01:14:58,828 --> 01:15:01,662
You have nice shoulders.
Really?

1627
01:15:01,664 --> 01:15:03,764
No, you really have
a lot of muscle.

1628
01:15:03,766 --> 01:15:06,167
Eh, no.
Not as much as you.

1629
01:15:06,169 --> 01:15:08,769
From carrying that kid around
and smashing his head.

1630
01:15:10,940 --> 01:15:12,406
Oh, yeah!
Work 'em.

1631
01:15:12,408 --> 01:15:14,542
Mr. wernick. Those are not
your wife's shoulders.

1632
01:15:14,544 --> 01:15:17,245
Busted!

1633
01:15:17,247 --> 01:15:18,546
Lovin' it, though.

1634
01:15:18,548 --> 01:15:20,414
Respect the vision.
I get it.

1635
01:15:20,416 --> 01:15:22,583
Gotta go for it, right?
You do!

1636
01:15:26,890 --> 01:15:29,857
Whoa!

1637
01:15:29,859 --> 01:15:33,594
Mm,
that was so relaxing.

1638
01:15:35,031 --> 01:15:37,565
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

1639
01:15:37,567 --> 01:15:40,801
I hope I put your pancreas
back where it belongs.

1640
01:15:40,803 --> 01:15:43,404
I don't even know
where it is right now.

1641
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:46,574
Are you
my sexy little wormhole?

1642
01:15:46,576 --> 01:15:48,175
Yeah, I'm your sexy
little wormhole!

1643
01:15:48,177 --> 01:15:50,244
Sexy...

1644
01:15:54,617 --> 01:15:56,651
They have fun.

1645
01:16:01,156 --> 01:16:05,326
That's very pretty.

1646
01:16:09,566 --> 01:16:11,165
You were...
you were very nice.

1647
01:16:11,167 --> 01:16:12,500
Thank you.

1648
01:16:12,502 --> 01:16:14,168
Oh, you know.

1649
01:16:14,170 --> 01:16:17,905
You're a strong woman.
Strong hands.

1650
01:16:17,907 --> 01:16:22,076
I'm glad
you like my hands.

1651
01:16:25,447 --> 01:16:26,514
Daddy?

1652
01:16:26,516 --> 01:16:29,216
Can Lauren put me to bed?

1653
01:16:29,218 --> 01:16:33,254
Sweetheart, daddy will put you
to bed in one second.

1654
01:16:33,256 --> 01:16:35,456
But I want Lauren.

1655
01:16:35,458 --> 01:16:36,557
Lauren w...

1656
01:16:36,559 --> 01:16:38,960
another time,
Lauren will do that.

1657
01:16:38,962 --> 01:16:42,263
But I want her
to put me to bed tonight.

1658
01:16:42,265 --> 01:16:43,698
And daddy said no.

1659
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:45,700
No.

1660
01:16:45,702 --> 01:16:47,535
No!

1661
01:16:47,537 --> 01:16:49,604
No!

1662
01:16:49,606 --> 01:16:52,707
I want Lauren.

1663
01:16:53,909 --> 01:16:57,912
I'm flattered.

1664
01:16:57,914 --> 01:17:00,348
That's good.

1665
01:17:00,350 --> 01:17:01,782
You're all right.

1666
01:17:01,784 --> 01:17:06,220
Okay. How's that?
Are you all cozy now?

1667
01:17:06,222 --> 01:17:07,888
Yes.
Daddy?

1668
01:17:07,890 --> 01:17:12,026
Can you give us
some alone time?

1669
01:17:14,496 --> 01:17:16,597
I could go
to the bathroom outside.

1670
01:17:16,599 --> 01:17:18,633
Is that what you want?
You got it.

1671
01:17:18,635 --> 01:17:21,202
Thrown out
of my own tent.

1672
01:17:21,204 --> 01:17:23,270
I own him.

1673
01:17:23,272 --> 01:17:25,072
It seems that way.

1674
01:17:25,074 --> 01:17:28,676
Can you rub my head
so I have good dreams?

1675
01:17:30,412 --> 01:17:32,046
Of course.

1676
01:17:34,516 --> 01:17:37,385
What a cute little head.

1677
01:17:39,255 --> 01:17:41,122
Ew.

1678
01:17:41,124 --> 01:17:44,659
Couldn't go a little further
from the tent?

1679
01:17:44,661 --> 01:17:46,394
What do you want from me?

1680
01:17:46,396 --> 01:17:48,963
There could be gorillas
out here, ready to kill.

1681
01:17:56,039 --> 01:17:57,838
Well,
why don't you get them

1682
01:17:57,840 --> 01:17:59,974
to give you some Flomax
or something.

1683
01:17:59,976 --> 01:18:02,777
Yep, gettin' older.
I'll give you that.

1684
01:18:02,779 --> 01:18:05,646
Can you sing to me?

1685
01:18:05,648 --> 01:18:08,883
Um, sure.

1686
01:18:08,885 --> 01:18:10,718
What should I sing?

1687
01:18:12,788 --> 01:18:19,360
♪ Somewhere over the rainbow ♪

1698
01:19:35,138 --> 01:19:36,637
I'm just kidding!

1699
01:19:36,639 --> 01:19:37,972
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry, I just...

1700
01:19:37,974 --> 01:19:40,107
I couldn't handle how
emotional it was getting.

1701
01:19:40,109 --> 01:19:42,243
I just...
I'm so... get some rest.

1702
01:19:42,245 --> 01:19:43,911
I didn't mean
to do that to you.

1703
01:19:52,921 --> 01:19:54,789
So get in your stance.
That's right.

1704
01:19:54,791 --> 01:19:57,324
And spread your legs just
a little bit. Like an inch.

1705
01:19:57,326 --> 01:19:59,727
Elbow up.
It's all about balance.

1706
01:19:59,729 --> 01:20:00,961
That's right.
That's right.

1707
01:20:00,963 --> 01:20:02,229
Keep your weight
right there.

1708
01:20:02,231 --> 01:20:04,298
How do you even
play cricket?

1709
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:06,066
We're not playing cricket.
We're playing baseball.

1710
01:20:06,068 --> 01:20:07,968
The only thing at the hotel
they had

1711
01:20:07,970 --> 01:20:09,970
was this stupid...
Battle thingamajiggy.

1712
01:20:09,972 --> 01:20:11,005
Who's that guy?

1713
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:12,640
He's some guy named Dale.

1714
01:20:12,642 --> 01:20:14,375
Uhhh,
he'll be pitchin' to ya.

1715
01:20:14,377 --> 01:20:16,811
Yeah, in cricket
we don't pitch, we bowl.

1716
01:20:16,813 --> 01:20:18,612
Hey, Dale.
How much am I payin' ya?

1717
01:20:18,614 --> 01:20:21,348
Five Brooklyn t-shirts from
your sporting goods store.

1718
01:20:21,350 --> 01:20:23,951
Okay, I'm gonna make it four
if you correct me again.

1719
01:20:23,953 --> 01:20:27,254
All right, Dale.
Pitch... or bowl one in.

1720
01:20:29,691 --> 01:20:31,125
I stink at this.

1721
01:20:31,127 --> 01:20:32,459
No, it's not you.
It's not you.

1722
01:20:32,461 --> 01:20:33,894
Dale, you think maybe
you can reach the plate?

1723
01:20:33,896 --> 01:20:35,162
That would help.

1724
01:20:35,164 --> 01:20:37,665
Actually, in cricket
we bounce the...

1725
01:20:37,667 --> 01:20:39,500
I'll try. I'll try.

1726
01:20:39,502 --> 01:20:40,868
All right.

1727
01:20:40,870 --> 01:20:42,903
Elbow up. Come on.
Get there.

1728
01:20:44,973 --> 01:20:47,074
I don't wanna do this!

1729
01:20:47,076 --> 01:20:48,576
Hey, hey.
What are you doin'?

1730
01:20:48,578 --> 01:20:49,810
You don't throw your bat.

1731
01:20:49,812 --> 01:20:51,045
Or whatever this thing
is called.

1732
01:20:51,047 --> 01:20:52,847
A bat.
Thank you.

1733
01:20:52,849 --> 01:20:54,281
You're an athlete.
You're a sportsman.

1734
01:20:54,283 --> 01:20:56,050
You gotta respect
your equipment.

1735
01:20:56,052 --> 01:20:58,052
Yes, sir.

1736
01:20:58,054 --> 01:20:59,954
We ain't leaving here
till you hit the ball

1737
01:20:59,956 --> 01:21:01,622
as good
as you ride an ostrich.

1738
01:21:02,757 --> 01:21:04,124
Pick up the bat.

1739
01:21:04,726 --> 01:21:06,460
Hey.

1740
01:21:06,462 --> 01:21:08,462
I know you're up there
all alone.

1741
01:21:08,464 --> 01:21:11,131
It's scary. You feel like
all the pressure's on you.

1742
01:21:11,133 --> 01:21:14,301
But guess what?
The pressure is on him.

1743
01:21:14,303 --> 01:21:18,172
Doesn't look like
he's feeling the pressure.

1744
01:21:20,742 --> 01:21:22,309
Oh, he's feeling it
all right.

1745
01:21:22,311 --> 01:21:24,578
He doesn't think he can get
the ball past ya.

1746
01:21:24,580 --> 01:21:27,748
I want ya to look him
right in the eyes

1747
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:29,617
and let him know
you own him.

1748
01:21:29,619 --> 01:21:32,186
Go ahead.

1749
01:21:32,188 --> 01:21:35,289
That's it, big time.
Give him the stink eye.

1750
01:21:37,393 --> 01:21:39,894
What's his problem?

1751
01:21:39,896 --> 01:21:42,096
Well, look at that.
You rattled him.

1752
01:21:42,098 --> 01:21:46,233
Okay. Dale, pitch it in
if ya got the guts.

1753
01:21:47,669 --> 01:21:49,870
Whoa!

1754
01:21:49,872 --> 01:21:51,705
Yes!
Did you see that?!

1755
01:21:51,707 --> 01:21:52,973
I killed it!

1756
01:21:52,975 --> 01:21:54,775
Let's do it
a hundred more times.

1757
01:21:54,777 --> 01:21:55,976
If I hit like that,

1758
01:21:55,978 --> 01:21:57,811
my dad's gonna start
comin' to my games.

1759
01:21:57,813 --> 01:21:59,213
What's goin' on here?

1760
01:21:59,215 --> 01:22:01,515
Jim just taught me how to make
the pitcher my bitch.

1761
01:22:01,517 --> 01:22:03,617
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.

1762
01:22:05,487 --> 01:22:07,821
My brother doesn't need you
to teach him how to hit!

1763
01:22:07,823 --> 01:22:09,924
Okay.
You wanna show him how to do it?

1764
01:22:09,926 --> 01:22:11,358
Let's see what you got.

1765
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:13,694
I don't need to prove
anything to you, d-bag.

1766
01:22:13,696 --> 01:22:17,464
Dale, did he really
just call me a d-bag?

1767
01:22:17,466 --> 01:22:19,366
This shit just got real.

1768
01:22:19,368 --> 01:22:21,302
I'm gonna kill you.

1769
01:22:21,304 --> 01:22:24,104
Okay, we'll see.
Let's get your gloves up.

1770
01:22:24,106 --> 01:22:25,306
Face protected.

1771
01:22:25,308 --> 01:22:27,841
Kick his ass, Brendan!
What's that?

1772
01:22:27,843 --> 01:22:30,110
Kick his ass, Jim!
Uh-huh.

1773
01:22:30,112 --> 01:22:31,645
Whoa! Whoa, whoa.

1774
01:22:31,647 --> 01:22:33,681
You see, you gotta...
you gotta look at your target.

1775
01:22:33,683 --> 01:22:36,050
How 'bout I put a picture
of your babysitter on my face?

1776
01:22:36,052 --> 01:22:37,318
Will you look at it then?
Huh?

1777
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:39,887
Oh! Oh, yeah, yeah.

1778
01:22:39,889 --> 01:22:40,921
Just leave her
out of this!

1779
01:22:40,923 --> 01:22:42,189
Use your right hand.

1780
01:22:42,191 --> 01:22:43,590
You're better with that one,
aren't you?

1781
01:22:43,592 --> 01:22:44,959
All right, all right.
Boom.

1782
01:22:44,961 --> 01:22:46,760
Ow.
Oh!

1783
01:22:46,762 --> 01:22:48,195
You seem pissed at me.

1784
01:22:48,197 --> 01:22:50,164
You just hit me!
No! Before that.

1785
01:22:50,166 --> 01:22:52,232
Before that,
like when we first met.

1786
01:22:52,234 --> 01:22:55,336
Just think that my mom
could do better.

1787
01:22:55,338 --> 01:22:56,737
First of all,
she can't do better,

1788
01:22:56,739 --> 01:22:57,871
'cause no one's better
than me.

1789
01:22:57,873 --> 01:22:59,039
I am the greatest.

1790
01:22:59,041 --> 01:23:00,441
Secondly,
I think it's nice

1791
01:23:00,443 --> 01:23:02,476
that you wanna protect
your mommy.

1792
01:23:02,478 --> 01:23:03,644
I hate you!

1793
01:23:03,646 --> 01:23:05,245
Oh!
Oh. Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa.

1794
01:23:05,247 --> 01:23:06,647
Calm down. Calm down.
That was good, though.

1795
01:23:06,649 --> 01:23:08,449
Showin' a little somethin'
in there.

1796
01:23:08,451 --> 01:23:11,318
Listen... Being a man ain't
about pissin' and moanin'

1797
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:13,253
anytime somethin's
botherin' you.

1798
01:23:13,255 --> 01:23:15,222
It's about dealin' with
what's in front of you.

1799
01:23:15,224 --> 01:23:16,757
So deal with me.

1800
01:23:16,759 --> 01:23:18,692
You...

1801
01:23:18,694 --> 01:23:20,094
are you okay?

1802
01:23:20,096 --> 01:23:22,696
That was sneaky.

1803
01:23:22,698 --> 01:23:23,897
But I'm fine.

1804
01:23:23,899 --> 01:23:27,067
Does that make me a man,
now, jimbo?

1805
01:23:27,069 --> 01:23:32,272
No. Askin' me if I was okay,
that was a start.

1817
01:24:04,306 --> 01:24:07,107
The bowler threw it,

1818
01:24:07,109 --> 01:24:09,009
and I hit it
like a mile away.

1819
01:24:09,011 --> 01:24:10,544
Yeah.

1820
01:24:10,546 --> 01:24:12,713
And then Jim taught me
how to box.

1821
01:24:12,715 --> 01:24:16,050
And after five minutes,
I basically knocked him out.

1822
01:24:16,052 --> 01:24:17,251
Yeah!

1823
01:24:17,253 --> 01:24:20,154
Well,
that was nice of him.

1824
01:24:20,156 --> 01:24:23,657
Kinda worked out well,
they came on this trip.

1825
01:24:23,659 --> 01:24:26,627
Yes, it did.

1826
01:24:42,177 --> 01:24:45,012
"Lauren, you looked so hot
in this dress

1827
01:24:45,014 --> 01:24:46,447
"I had to buy it for you.

1828
01:24:46,449 --> 01:24:48,315
And by 'buy, ' I mean 'steal.'"

1829
01:24:48,317 --> 01:24:50,384
"Hope you're having fun
on my vacation."

1830
01:24:58,194 --> 01:25:00,327
So its... its tongue
was ridiculous.

1831
01:25:00,329 --> 01:25:02,563
It got me,
like, all over.

1832
01:25:02,565 --> 01:25:06,100
It was, like, in balls.
They were like...

1833
01:25:06,102 --> 01:25:07,701
Oh! Like a stick...
like a stem.

1834
01:25:07,703 --> 01:25:09,136
Like... like a stem going
against each other,
head-to-head.

1835
01:25:09,138 --> 01:25:10,404
Dad.

1836
01:25:10,406 --> 01:25:12,272
Did you comb your hair?

1837
01:25:12,274 --> 01:25:15,843
No. Got out of the shower
like this, I guess.

1838
01:25:15,845 --> 01:25:17,311
You took a shower?

1839
01:25:17,313 --> 01:25:19,513
I shower!
I'm allowed to shower.

1840

My God.

1841
01:25:20,616 --> 01:25:23,016
I haven't taken a shower
since we got here.

1842
01:25:23,018 --> 01:25:24,718
I know. You stink.
I love it.

1843
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:25,986
Yeah, I stink bad.

1844
01:25:25,988 --> 01:25:27,554
Yeah, you stink real bad.

1845
01:25:27,556 --> 01:25:29,256
Your breath
smells terrible.

Hello.

1859
01:26:14,303 --> 01:26:15,736
Dad!
Say something to her.

1860
01:26:15,738 --> 01:26:19,373
Yes, yes.
You look very, very nice.

1861
01:26:19,375 --> 01:26:21,842
Oh, well, thank you.
You showered.

1862
01:26:21,844 --> 01:26:24,478
Am I really known as
the non-shower guy?

1863
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:26,113
I shower all the time,
guys.

1864
01:26:28,150 --> 01:26:29,917
Ladies and gentlemen...

1865
01:26:29,919 --> 01:26:31,151
Don't listen to her, okay?

1866
01:26:31,153 --> 01:26:33,320
...it's the final night

1867
01:26:33,322 --> 01:26:37,925
of our blended family experience
here in Africa.

1868
01:26:39,094 --> 01:26:41,628
Boo!

1869
01:26:41,630 --> 01:26:45,165
Our tradition is to invite
the kiddies to the pool area

1870
01:26:45,167 --> 01:26:48,602
for our famous kids-only
safari buffet

1871
01:26:48,604 --> 01:26:52,339
and ten-foot chocolate
rain forest fountain!

1872
01:26:52,341 --> 01:26:53,974
Can we go, dad?!

1873
01:26:53,976 --> 01:26:55,108
All right, go ahead.

1874
01:26:55,110 --> 01:26:56,376
Stay with your sisters,
though.

1875
01:26:56,378 --> 01:26:57,778
Oooh! My boy
here's a chocoholic.

1876
01:26:57,780 --> 01:27:00,013
You better watch out.
Or he's gonna jump in

1877
01:27:00,015 --> 01:27:03,116
and come out lookin' like
a handsome hershey bar.

1878
01:27:04,820 --> 01:27:07,554
Did you see that?
I made him smile.

1879
01:27:07,556 --> 01:27:10,791
He tried not to,
but he couldn't help himself.

1880
01:27:10,793 --> 01:27:13,694
We're gonna be
a great family.

1881
01:27:13,696 --> 01:27:15,762
Yes, we are.

1882
01:27:15,764 --> 01:27:17,364
Love you.

1883
01:27:17,366 --> 01:27:21,835
All of the little ones
have gone.

1884
01:27:21,837 --> 01:27:24,905
Tonight
the dining room is...

1885
01:27:24,907 --> 01:27:27,841
Adults-only.

1886
01:27:28,744 --> 01:27:30,477
Yeah, now
we're gettin' there.

1887
01:27:30,479 --> 01:27:33,947
Let's have all you blended

01:27:44,260 --> 01:27:52,260

it's crazy, huh?
The song.

1892
01:28:01,810 --> 01:28:06,413
He took the word "splendid"
and replaced it with "blended."

1893
01:28:06,415 --> 01:28:08,181
So clever. It rhymes!

1894
01:28:08,183 --> 01:28:10,550
But the real word is
"splendored."

1895
01:28:10,552 --> 01:28:12,919
So wouldn't it be
"blendored"?

1896
01:28:12,921 --> 01:28:14,488
What's this now?

1897
01:28:14,490 --> 01:28:16,456
I'm just rambling.
I'm sorry. What...?

1898
01:28:16,458 --> 01:28:19,259
Are you ready,
Mr. chiapetolis?

1899
01:28:19,261 --> 01:28:20,594
"Chiapetolis"?

1900
01:28:20,596 --> 01:28:21,795
All right. That was...
he finally got it.

1901
01:28:21,797 --> 01:28:23,630
Ready for what?

1902
01:28:23,632 --> 01:28:26,900
You scheduled
a star-gazing experience.

1903
01:28:26,902 --> 01:28:31,605
So... Mrs. Chiapetolis, would
you like to come join me?

1904
01:28:31,607 --> 01:28:34,408
Oh. Yeah.

Here we are.
Dinner for two.

1912
01:29:01,337 --> 01:29:03,003
Oh, yeah.

Wow.
It's good.

I gotta give it up
to dick.

1915
01:29:07,409 --> 01:29:10,711
He's probably the most
romantic guy on the planet.

1916
01:29:10,713 --> 01:29:12,433
Yeah, he's got the moves.
No doubt about it.

1917
01:29:13,649 --> 01:29:16,917
I bet this is where he was
gonna ask Jen to marry him.

1918
01:29:16,919 --> 01:29:18,352
Maybe.

1919
01:29:18,354 --> 01:29:21,188
We were able to get everything
you asked for this morning,

1920
01:29:21,190 --> 01:29:23,957
except the sticks of cheese
in the shape of a heart.

1921
01:29:23,959 --> 01:29:25,225
Shh, shh!

1922
01:29:25,227 --> 01:29:28,061
Cheese sticks?

1923
01:29:28,063 --> 01:29:30,130
Did you set this up?

1924
01:29:30,132 --> 01:29:31,631
I wanted a do-over.

1925
01:29:31,633 --> 01:29:33,600
For that
first date fiasco.

1926
01:29:33,602 --> 01:29:35,235

May this be your moment.

1932
01:29:52,121 --> 01:29:54,354
Did you eat pork chops

01:29:54,356 --> 01:29:57,624
with... Tuna fish
today at lunch?

1934

Yes, I did.
I can tell.

1935
01:30:00,229 --> 01:30:01,428
Apologies.

1936
01:30:01,430 --> 01:30:03,397
I will brush my teeth
presently,

Mr. lollipopolis.

1938
01:30:04,433 --> 01:30:06,199
I'd brush 'em twice.

1939
01:30:06,201 --> 01:30:07,841
And did you really
call me "lollipopolis"?

You're a pretty good mom

thanks to you.

1969

Tell your, uh... his father,
the more he works with him,

1970
01:31:31,019 --> 01:31:32,886
the more he's gonna get
confident,

1971
01:31:32,888 --> 01:31:35,355
the more he's gonna belt the
ball anytime he gets up there.

1972
01:31:35,357 --> 01:31:36,756
Yeah, well, his dad's

1973

not really into working
with him, you know,

1974
01:31:39,728 --> 01:31:42,162
'cause to do that,
he'd have to show up,

1975
01:31:42,164 --> 01:31:43,263
which he's just...

1976
01:31:43,265 --> 01:31:44,631
Not good at.

1977
01:31:44,633 --> 01:31:46,933
You gotta show up
for your kids.

1978
01:31:46,935 --> 01:31:50,637
It should be boring how...
Reliable a parent is.

1979
01:31:50,639 --> 01:31:54,007
I... it's funny to me that
some people don't get that.

1980
01:31:54,009 --> 01:31:55,108
You do!

1981
01:31:55,110 --> 01:31:58,111
I mean, your kid
needs to come first

1982
01:31:58,113 --> 01:31:59,746
100% of the time.

1983
01:31:59,748 --> 01:32:01,581
Absolutely. 99%.

1984
01:32:01,583 --> 01:32:03,116
1% of the time,

1985

to get what we want.

1986
01:32:05,888 --> 01:32:08,088
Ah, God.

1987
01:32:08,090 --> 01:32:11,725
I forgot what it was like
to want something.

1988
01:32:11,727 --> 01:32:16,796
I vaguely remember
it... Feels good.

1989
01:32:27,909 --> 01:32:32,612
I can't do this.
I can't do this.

1990
01:32:32,614 --> 01:32:34,347
I'm sorry.

1991
01:32:34,349 --> 01:32:37,317
I really...
I'm... I'm...

1992
01:32:37,319 --> 01:32:38,752
it's not you.

1993
01:32:41,924 --> 01:32:44,491
I thought I could do this.
I just...

1994
01:32:48,696 --> 01:32:51,565
Sorry about them too.

1995
01:32:54,168 --> 01:32:55,902

1996
01:33:01,776 --> 01:33:05,211

1998
01:33:10,552 --> 01:33:11,952

1999
01:33:11,954 --> 01:33:13,653
Although,
you have to admit.

2000
01:33:13,655 --> 01:33:16,022

the violins and stuff?

2001

That is hilarious.

2002
01:33:17,993 --> 01:33:20,794
I can't believe that we both
found these great guys

2003
01:33:20,796 --> 01:33:22,862
and we're not gonna end up
with them.

2004
01:33:25,867 --> 01:33:27,867
Are you gonna get that?

2005
01:33:31,839 --> 01:33:34,708
Hi. It's not a good time
right now.

2006
01:33:34,710 --> 01:33:36,142
Yeah.

2007

I "l" word you so hard.
And you know what?

2008
01:33:38,814 --> 01:33:40,847
I am gonna make
"l" word to you

2009
01:33:40,849 --> 01:33:42,582
for at least
an hour and a half.

2010
01:33:43,785 --> 01:33:46,586
Okay.

2011

Hmm.

2012
01:33:47,756 --> 01:33:50,790
That was my mom.

2013
01:33:50,792 --> 01:33:52,392
And she's doing good.

2014
01:33:53,527 --> 01:33:54,728
All right.

2015
01:33:54,730 --> 01:33:56,496
I'm giving dick
another chance.

2016
01:33:56,498 --> 01:33:59,032
To do what?
Get rid of his kids?

2017
01:33:59,034 --> 01:34:02,002
I'm gonna meet
his children.

2018
01:34:02,871 --> 01:34:04,771
You should try saying that

2019
01:34:04,773 --> 01:34:07,574
without contorting
your face so much.

2020
01:34:07,576 --> 01:34:10,910
I'm gonna meet
his children.

2021

2022
01:34:13,315 --> 01:34:15,548
I'm sorry about Jim.

2023
01:34:15,550 --> 01:34:18,184
Me too.

2024
01:34:42,043 --> 01:34:44,611
Why didn't you
kiss her, man?

2025
01:34:44,613 --> 01:34:47,781
I couldn't.

2026
01:34:47,783 --> 01:34:50,216
I just...

2027
01:34:50,218 --> 01:34:54,654
I was afraid it wasn't
the right thing to do.

2028
01:34:54,656 --> 01:34:57,157

to you?

01:35:18,246 --> 01:35:19,279
Where you off to?

2038
01:35:19,281 --> 01:35:20,980
Oh, I'm goin' on a date
with Jake.

2039
01:35:20,982 --> 01:35:22,215
How can you go out
with Jake?

2040
01:35:22,217 --> 01:35:23,283
He lives in Vancouver.

2041
01:35:23,285 --> 01:35:25,585

2043

Listen, make sure
plenty of beef.

2047
01:35:34,496 --> 01:35:35,729
That's the way.

Just fix it, then.

2051
01:35:41,403 --> 01:35:43,837
So, when are we gonna
see Lauren again?

2052
01:35:43,839 --> 01:35:46,039
Something happened

2053
01:35:46,041 --> 01:35:47,407
No.
What are you, crazy?

2054
01:35:47,409 --> 01:35:48,808
Nothin' happened.

2055
01:35:48,810 --> 01:35:51,010
Dad, come on.
I saw the way you looked at her,

2056
01:35:51,012 --> 01:35:52,545
and I saw the way
she looked at you.

2057
01:35:52,547 --> 01:35:53,913
<i>It's undeniable.</i>

2058
01:35:53,915 --> 01:35:55,915
<i>You guys are infatuated</i>
<i>with each other.</i>

2059
01:35:55,917 --> 01:35:57,417
Jake, butt out.

2060
01:35:57,419 --> 01:35:58,718
<i>Sorry, sir.</i>

2061
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:00,353
Don't you guys have
anything better to do

2062
01:36:00,355 --> 01:36:02,222
than look at people
looking at each other?

2063
01:36:02,224 --> 01:36:04,691
Besides, wha-what am
I supposed to do?

2064
01:36:04,693 --> 01:36:08,595
Change our whole lives just
because I'm in love with her?

2065
01:36:08,597 --> 01:36:11,297
Yes!

2066
01:36:13,868 --> 01:36:15,568
Wow.

2067
01:36:15,570 --> 01:36:16,903
<i>So romantic!</i>

2068
01:36:16,905 --> 01:36:19,773
<i>Lovin' it!</i>
<i>Takin' a risk.</i>

2069
01:36:19,775 --> 01:36:21,908
<i>Go get her, baby!</i>

2070
01:36:25,980 --> 01:36:28,648
I know I confused you.

2071
01:36:28,650 --> 01:36:31,117
I just...
I had to make sure.

2072
01:36:31,119 --> 01:36:33,887
For my wife
and for my kids.

2073
01:36:33,889 --> 01:36:36,456
And for your kids.
And for you. And...

2074
01:36:36,458 --> 01:36:39,559
Just so we have no lies.

2075
01:36:39,561 --> 01:36:42,929
It was me who drank your beer
at Hooters.

2076
01:36:42,931 --> 01:36:44,564
I dunno why I did that.

2077
01:36:44,566 --> 01:36:48,935
I get free beers there,
so it was just panic then.

2078
01:37:05,786 --> 01:37:07,554
Yeah?

2079
01:37:07,556 --> 01:37:10,790
This is 323, right?

2080
01:37:10,792 --> 01:37:12,525
Yeah.

2081
01:37:12,527 --> 01:37:14,928
I was lookin' for l-Lauren.

2082
01:37:14,930 --> 01:37:16,863
You and me both.

2083
01:37:16,865 --> 01:37:18,765
Jim!

2084
01:37:18,767 --> 01:37:21,267
Big time!
Look at you!

2085
01:37:21,269 --> 01:37:24,237
Mom's not home.
This is my dad.

2086
01:37:24,239 --> 01:37:25,939
Mark.

2087
01:37:25,941 --> 01:37:27,507
Yeah. Who are you?

2088
01:37:27,509 --> 01:37:29,409
Jim!
The cool guy from the safari.

2089
01:37:29,411 --> 01:37:32,378
Do you wanna "bowl" me
a few pitches?

2090
01:37:32,380 --> 01:37:35,882
Uh... I'm sure your father
wants to do that with ya.

2091
01:37:35,884 --> 01:37:37,917
Mm. No, he doesn't.

2092
01:37:37,919 --> 01:37:40,720
No, no, no, no.
Go get your bat, big time.

2093
01:37:40,722 --> 01:37:42,055
Hey! We can all play!

2094
01:37:42,057 --> 01:37:44,958
I'll get Brendan's glove.
He never uses it.

2095
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:48,294
Boy, he hasn't shut up
about that Africa trip.

2096
01:37:48,296 --> 01:37:51,264
Your kids are... Incredible.

2097
01:37:51,266 --> 01:37:53,666
Yeah.
That's why Lauren and I

2098
01:37:53,668 --> 01:37:57,704
are, you know, trying to make
things work again.

2099
01:37:57,706 --> 01:37:59,105
For them.

2100
01:37:59,107 --> 01:38:02,642
I didn't know that.
Yeah.

2101
01:38:02,644 --> 01:38:03,977
I'll tell her
you came by.

2102
01:38:03,979 --> 01:38:08,481
And, uh...
I'll put these in the bedroom...

2103
01:38:08,483 --> 01:38:11,217
Next to where we make love.

2104
01:38:13,220 --> 01:38:15,922
Okay.

2105
01:38:15,924 --> 01:38:19,659
Tell, uh, Tyler
I said goodbye.

2106
01:38:22,997 --> 01:38:25,131
Where's Jim goin'?

2107
01:38:25,133 --> 01:38:27,767
He had stuff to do,
I guess.

2108
01:38:27,769 --> 01:38:31,271
Can you and me play,
then?

2109
01:38:31,273 --> 01:38:32,405
Yeah, of co...

2110
01:38:32,407 --> 01:38:35,074
Oooh! Saved by the bell.

2111
01:38:35,076 --> 01:38:37,310
Hey, what's up?

2112
01:38:37,312 --> 01:38:40,280
You busy?

2113
01:39:09,476 --> 01:39:10,643
Hi.

2114
01:39:10,645 --> 01:39:12,178
Oh! Hi.

2115
01:39:12,180 --> 01:39:15,915
Is there a gq
photo shoot going on here?

2116
01:39:15,917 --> 01:39:18,117
No... oh, no.
I'm just, uh...

2117
01:39:18,119 --> 01:39:19,385
I'm just chillin'.

2118
01:39:19,387 --> 01:39:21,421
I'm sorry
that took so long.

2119
01:39:21,423 --> 01:39:24,090
Thank you for watching
after the boys.

2120
01:39:24,092 --> 01:39:25,658
I'm done now
and I'm guessing

2121
01:39:25,660 --> 01:39:27,894
you have somewhere
you gotta go, so...

2122
01:39:27,896 --> 01:39:29,696
How do you always
look so great?

2123
01:39:29,698 --> 01:39:31,164
Yeah?

2124
01:39:31,166 --> 01:39:33,766
It's my haven't-washed-my-hair
in-three-days look.

2125
01:39:33,768 --> 01:39:35,168
Thanks for noticing.

2126
01:39:35,170 --> 01:39:37,103
You're so funny.

2127
01:39:38,472 --> 01:39:41,307
It's hard for me to imagine you
with someone else.

2128
01:39:41,309 --> 01:39:43,576
Really?! It wasn't hard for you
to imagine yourself

2129
01:39:43,578 --> 01:39:45,545
with someone else
when you cheated on me.

2130
01:39:45,547 --> 01:39:48,114
No matter what I say, you
always bring it back to that.

2131
01:39:48,116 --> 01:39:50,016
I could say, "hey,
look at that house."

2132
01:39:50,018 --> 01:39:51,751
And you'd say,
"oh, we lived in a house

2133
01:39:51,753 --> 01:39:53,019
when you cheated on me."

2134
01:39:53,021 --> 01:39:54,821
Or I could say,
"pass that pickle."

2135
01:39:54,823 --> 01:39:56,155
And you could say...

2136
01:39:56,157 --> 01:39:58,037
something about a pickle
and you cheating on me.

2137
01:39:59,561 --> 01:40:02,495
It's fun to laugh with you
again, Lauren.

2138
01:40:02,497 --> 01:40:04,998
We used to do that
all the time.

2139
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:06,933
You brought flowers?

2140
01:40:06,935 --> 01:40:10,036
Yeah.

2141
01:40:11,805 --> 01:40:13,806
Why'd you bring flowers?

2142
01:40:13,808 --> 01:40:16,609
Because you deserve
flowers.

2143
01:40:18,345 --> 01:40:21,247
Lauren, when you went away
to Africa,

2144
01:40:21,249 --> 01:40:23,116
I did a lot of thinking.

2145
01:40:23,118 --> 01:40:25,418
You and I, we have so much
history together.

2146
01:40:25,420 --> 01:40:26,719
Two boys.

2147
01:40:26,721 --> 01:40:28,488
One receptionist.

2148
01:40:28,490 --> 01:40:31,491
I... look,
I made a mistake! That's...

2149
01:40:31,493 --> 01:40:34,794
you made at least four mistakes
that I know of.

2150
01:40:34,796 --> 01:40:36,362
Made. Past tense.

2151
01:40:36,364 --> 01:40:39,165
I-I was a jerk.
Lauren...

2152
01:40:39,167 --> 01:40:41,234
You were the best thing
in my life.

2153
01:40:41,236 --> 01:40:42,602
You and the boys.

2154
01:40:42,604 --> 01:40:47,407
And boys need
their fathers.

2155
01:40:47,409 --> 01:40:49,242
They do.

2156
01:40:49,244 --> 01:40:51,511
I know
that I'm a good father.

2157
01:40:51,513 --> 01:40:54,047
I just need
to prove it to them.

2158
01:40:54,049 --> 01:40:56,449
Well, you can!
It's not too late.

2159
01:40:56,451 --> 01:41:00,620
Is it too late...
For this?

2160
01:41:01,622 --> 01:41:04,357
What... Are you doing?!

2161
01:41:04,359 --> 01:41:06,092
I'm comin' home, baby.

2162
01:41:06,094 --> 01:41:08,961
Oh! G... mark!
Get off of me!

2163
01:41:08,963 --> 01:41:10,930
You don't live here
anymore!

2164
01:41:10,932 --> 01:41:13,533
Is there someone else?

2165
01:41:14,736 --> 01:41:17,703
No. And that's none
of your business anyway.

2166
01:41:17,705 --> 01:41:21,274
You're interested
in being a good father?

2167
01:41:21,276 --> 01:41:24,077
Tyler has a game
on Saturday. Be there.

2168
01:41:44,531 --> 01:41:45,531
Dad?

2169
01:41:45,533 --> 01:41:48,935
I didn't mean to wake you.
Sorry.

2170
01:41:48,937 --> 01:41:52,638
I was talking to mom
before bed.

2171
01:41:52,640 --> 01:41:54,674
Mm-hmm.

2172
01:41:54,676 --> 01:42:00,113
And she says she has
a lot of stuff to do.

2173
01:42:00,115 --> 01:42:02,648
She does?

2174
01:42:02,650 --> 01:42:04,117
Y-yeah.

2175
01:42:04,119 --> 01:42:09,222
So she might not be able
to hang around as much.

2176
01:42:11,893 --> 01:42:13,326
Okay.

2177
01:42:13,328 --> 01:42:17,830
She also said you need to
increase my allowance to $5.

2178
01:42:17,832 --> 01:42:21,534
She's very generous.

2179
01:42:24,338 --> 01:42:27,740
I just...

2180
01:42:27,742 --> 01:42:32,378
I don't want her
to disappear.

2181
01:42:32,380 --> 01:42:36,716
Sweetheart, she's never
gonna disappear.

2182
01:42:36,718 --> 01:42:37,950
Never ever.

2183
01:42:37,952 --> 01:42:39,685
You can let her go.

2184
01:42:39,687 --> 01:42:42,955
She will always
be right here.

2185
01:42:42,957 --> 01:42:44,757
And I will always be
here.

2186
01:42:44,759 --> 01:42:46,993
I promise you.

2187
01:42:57,504 --> 01:43:03,209
By the way,
mom loved the Africa trip.

2188
01:43:03,211 --> 01:43:06,245
So did I.

2189
01:43:08,348 --> 01:43:10,149
I miss her.

2190
01:43:10,151 --> 01:43:13,085
Your mother
was the greatest.

2191
01:43:13,087 --> 01:43:15,755
I mean Lauren.

2192
01:43:18,125 --> 01:43:20,426
Me too.

2193
01:43:20,428 --> 01:43:24,697
We don't have to let go
of her, too, do we?

2194
01:43:24,699 --> 01:43:27,800
Come here.

2195
01:43:37,611 --> 01:43:40,580
Brendan, don't forget that
I'm picking you up for scouts,

2196
01:43:40,582 --> 01:43:42,148
so don't take the bus home.

2197
01:43:43,718 --> 01:43:45,818
Thanks for telling everyone
I'm still in scouts, mom.

2198
01:43:45,820 --> 01:43:48,221
You're a good boy.
Be proud of who you are.

2199
01:44:11,111 --> 01:44:13,479
Say one word
and you're dead.

2200
01:44:13,481 --> 01:44:16,048
You're driving a minivan.

2201
01:44:16,050 --> 01:44:17,650
It's dick's.

2202
01:44:17,652 --> 01:44:21,087
I'm off to buy toilet paper
for team theodopolis.

2203
01:44:21,089 --> 01:44:22,755
When the team
needs toilet paper,

2204
01:44:22,757 --> 01:44:24,657
the co-captain goes
and gets it.

2205
01:44:24,659 --> 01:44:27,326
And believe me, those kids
never stop crapping.

2206
01:44:27,328 --> 01:44:29,996
Kids need to crap.

2207
01:44:29,998 --> 01:44:31,364
You need anything from...

2208
01:44:31,366 --> 01:44:33,266
...Walmart?

2209
01:44:33,268 --> 01:44:35,301
I'm good.

2210
01:44:35,303 --> 01:44:37,937
See ya
at the pta meeting.

2211
01:44:37,939 --> 01:44:39,538
Okay, foxy.

2212
01:44:49,449 --> 01:44:50,983
Yeah.
You've got this one.

2213
01:44:53,387 --> 01:44:56,222
Yeah! Base on!
Please stop that.

2214
01:44:56,224 --> 01:44:58,324
Uh, this is so good,
honey. This...

2215
01:44:58,326 --> 01:45:00,426
that's okay. Great.
This is family.

2216
01:45:00,428 --> 01:45:01,560
This is fun for me.

2217
01:45:01,562 --> 01:45:03,796
All right, all right!

2218
01:45:03,798 --> 01:45:06,198
Way to make contact.

2219
01:45:06,200 --> 01:45:08,401
Way to go, dad.

2220
01:45:08,403 --> 01:45:09,669
One out to go,

2221
01:45:09,671 --> 01:45:10,936
but standard fence
has a rally going.

2222
01:45:10,938 --> 01:45:12,672
Standard fence,
let's do it!

2223
01:45:12,674 --> 01:45:17,543
Now batting, number 23,
Tyler Reynolds.

2224
01:45:20,081 --> 01:45:21,347
Hey, that's not nice!

2225
01:45:21,349 --> 01:45:23,349
Aw, shut up.
That kid's awful.

2226
01:45:23,351 --> 01:45:24,383
Go, Tyler!

2227
01:45:24,385 --> 01:45:25,918
Go, Tyler!

2228
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:27,753
Tracy.

2229
01:45:27,755 --> 01:45:29,955
What's your head
doing here?

2230
01:45:32,426 --> 01:45:33,659
Easy out.

2231
01:45:33,661 --> 01:45:36,095
- New batter!
- Easy!

2232
01:45:37,130 --> 01:45:39,865
You got him, Kevin.

2233
01:45:50,143 --> 01:45:52,178
Strike one!

2234
01:45:52,180 --> 01:45:54,080
I'm so sorry
mark didn't show up.

2235
01:45:54,082 --> 01:45:55,848
I mean, he just
doesn't get it, you know?

2236
01:45:55,850 --> 01:45:59,018
Your kids have to come first
100% of the time.

2237
01:45:59,020 --> 01:46:02,088
Well, like 99%.
You get 1% for yourself.

2238
01:46:02,090 --> 01:46:04,156
That's great news.

2239
01:46:04,158 --> 01:46:08,027
Well, no matter what, you have
to show up for your kids.

2240
01:46:08,029 --> 01:46:10,363
Like him.

2241
01:46:10,365 --> 01:46:12,031
Hey, hey!

2242
01:46:12,033 --> 01:46:14,333
All right, big time!
Come on, Tyler!
Come on, Tyler!

2243
01:46:14,335 --> 01:46:15,634
Lookin' good out there!

2244
01:46:17,372 --> 01:46:20,773
Get that elbow up!
Elbow up!

2245
01:46:20,775 --> 01:46:22,575
Incredible.

2246
01:46:22,577 --> 01:46:26,412
Yeah!
Eye on the ball!

2247
01:46:28,148 --> 01:46:29,648
Come on, Tyler.

2248
01:46:31,351 --> 01:46:33,152
Strike two!

2249
01:46:33,154 --> 01:46:34,754
All right, all right!

2250
01:46:36,857 --> 01:46:40,292
Nice cut, nice cut.
Slow it down a little bit.

2251
01:46:40,294 --> 01:46:43,396
Bend those knees.
Balance, okay?

2252
01:46:43,398 --> 01:46:45,865
Take care of this.
That's it.

2253
01:46:45,867 --> 01:46:48,134
Elbow up.
Higher, higher.

2254
01:46:48,136 --> 01:46:50,903
Now,
remember the stink eye.

2255
01:46:53,641 --> 01:46:56,142
The mustache is rattled.

2256
01:46:56,144 --> 01:46:57,943
Come on, Tyler, let's go!
Come on, Tyler!

2257
01:46:57,945 --> 01:46:59,678
Take 'em deep.

2258
01:47:17,431 --> 01:47:18,664
You hit it!

2259
01:47:18,666 --> 01:47:20,266
Run, Tyler, run!

2260
01:47:28,642 --> 01:47:31,177
Keep goin', brother!
Go!

2261
01:47:31,179 --> 01:47:34,013
Whoo!
Go!

2262
01:47:34,015 --> 01:47:36,482
Don't hesitate.
Come, come!

2263
01:47:37,918 --> 01:47:41,854
Come to me, big time!
Go!

2264
01:47:41,856 --> 01:47:43,689
Run to me!

2265
01:47:43,691 --> 01:47:48,060
Keep it goin', Tyler!
We're goin' home, baby!

2266
01:47:48,062 --> 01:47:50,429
We're goin' home!

2267
01:47:51,833 --> 01:47:52,833
Safe!

2268
01:47:52,834 --> 01:47:55,067
Yeah!
Yes!

2269
01:47:56,903 --> 01:47:59,738
Do you believe in miracles?!

2270
01:48:02,275 --> 01:48:04,176
Yeah! Whoo!

2271
01:48:04,178 --> 01:48:07,880
Yeah!
That's my brother!

2272
01:48:10,150 --> 01:48:11,951
Thank you.

2273
01:48:11,953 --> 01:48:14,587
All you in there,
big time.

2274
01:48:14,589 --> 01:48:17,022
Oh, my God!

2275
01:48:19,526 --> 01:48:22,194
What are you doing?!

2276
01:48:22,196 --> 01:48:24,196
I love you!

2277
01:48:24,198 --> 01:48:25,397
That was amazing.

2278
01:48:25,399 --> 01:48:27,733
I'm so sorry
to show up like this.

2279
01:48:27,735 --> 01:48:30,102
I-I was at your house
the other day

2280
01:48:30,104 --> 01:48:31,537
and I saw your ex-husband
blow off Tyler

2281
01:48:31,539 --> 01:48:33,205
when he wanted to practice

2282
01:48:33,207 --> 01:48:35,174
and I know you guys are trying
to work it out, but it just...

2283
01:48:35,176 --> 01:48:36,642
it just broke my heart.

2284
01:48:36,644 --> 01:48:40,079
We're not working it out.
That's never gonna happen.

2285
01:48:40,081 --> 01:48:41,447
Really?

2286
01:48:41,449 --> 01:48:45,484
What were you doing
at my house?

2287
01:48:45,486 --> 01:48:49,288
I came by
to tell you that...

2288
01:48:49,290 --> 01:48:52,625
I think it's okay now.

2289
01:48:52,627 --> 01:48:55,060
Okay for what?

2290
01:48:55,062 --> 01:48:58,764
Okay to have one
of those rare, rare moments

2291
01:48:58,766 --> 01:49:00,766
where we get
what we want.

2292
01:49:00,768 --> 01:49:05,004
Oh. Well,
what do we want?

2293
01:49:05,006 --> 01:49:07,840
You know what we want.

2294
01:49:07,842 --> 01:49:10,042
Yeah.

2295
01:49:10,044 --> 01:49:12,144
I think the kids
want it, too.

2296
01:49:12,146 --> 01:49:16,115
Not as much as I do there,
schlumpy shoulders.

2297
01:49:17,518 --> 01:49:21,754
Wait.
I can't do this.

2298
01:49:21,756 --> 01:49:23,255
You're kiddin' me.

2299
01:49:23,257 --> 01:49:24,657
Totally.

2300
01:49:24,659 --> 01:49:27,493
I just had to get you back
for Africa.

2301
01:49:27,495 --> 01:49:28,894
Come on.

2302
01:49:37,837 --> 01:49:42,074
You know somethin'?
Your mom is hot.

2303
01:49:42,076 --> 01:49:45,477
Your dad's
pretty hot, too.

2304
01:49:45,479 --> 01:49:47,212
Not hot.

2305
01:49:49,283 --> 01:49:52,151
Come on,
you deserve a nice massage.

2306
01:49:52,153 --> 01:49:53,686
Ow!
Oh, it's good.

2307
01:49:53,688 --> 01:49:54,853
Come on, you like that,
you like that.

2308
01:49:54,855 --> 01:49:56,322
Oh, it hurts so good.

2309
01:49:56,324 --> 01:49:57,690
