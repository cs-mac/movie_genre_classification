1
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:46,550
Pass it left to Jack!

2
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,110
Pass the bloody thing,
Tom!

3
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,350
Tom, pass it left!

4
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,110
Pass the ball!
Come on, Tom!

5
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:51,750
To Jack!

6
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:52,750
Go on, Tom!

7
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,630
Tom!

8
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,990
What's that man's name?!

9
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,110
You see the girls, Jack?

10
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:13,870
Push on!
Move it, boys! Come on!

11
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,230
Stand tall!

12
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,230
There you go... straight.

13
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:20,470
Go on, Vicar!

14
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,550
Sean! Sean!

15
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,310
Go on... keep going!

16
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:42,910
Break it up!

17
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,670
I need you on the field, lad.

18
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,870
- Huh?
- You're all right.

19
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:57,630
Behind you!

20
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,350
Jack!

21
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,030
Take it, Jack!

22
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,670
Well done, old chap!

23
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,630
Well done, Jack.

24
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,830
Is there anything else left
in there?

25
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:36,230
How long you going to be
in that bathtub, Vicar?

26
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,230
As long as I like.

27
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,630
Stand tall, Vicar.

28
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:44,270
Idiot!

29
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:47,310
Willoughby, you look wonderful,
darling.

30
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:48,270
Princess Willoughby.

31
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,270
Miss Willoughby.

32
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,790
Hey, Tom, there's a hair
out of place there, boy.

33
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,950
When are you gentlemen
going to grow up?

34
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,790
"Gentlemen"? Did he
just call us "gentlemen"?

35
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:55,750
I believe he did.

36
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:57,510
- I won't take that from anyone.
- Nor will I.

37
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,990
I like when you do this.

38
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:00,990
Not my hair!

39
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,590
- Willoughby, this is...
- Not the hair!

40
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,230
Not the hair!

41
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,030
And don't think we're going
to take you any more seriously

42
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,550
once you're promoted,
Miss Willoughby.

43
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,990
- We'll see about that.
- Whoo!

44
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:15,070
Ladies.

45
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,030
Don't worry, Vicar,
they're only women.

46
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:18,030
They won't bite.

47
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:18,990
Just be quiet.

48
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,110
Does it hurt?

49
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,230
Uh... yes.

50
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,590
What are you two lovebirds
laughing about?

51
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:38,550
His eye.

52
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,870
Don't fall for it.

53
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,110
He colors it in with a pen.

54
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:43,470
I can draw you one
if you're feeling left out.

55
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,550
Go on, then.

56
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,990
What?

57
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:50,150
Well, I want a black eye
like Jack's.

58
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:53,550
If you really want one, Harry,
I... can facilitate you.

59
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:54,790
Want a second black eye, Jack?

60
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:55,910
No.

61
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:01,590
That's good.

62
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,150
Are you nervous?

63
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,230
Stop it.

64
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,990
What?

65
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,550
What are you two doing?

66
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,510
Nothing.

67
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:30,030
I want to dance.

68
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:32,230
N-Not up there, Ethne.

69
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,350
Now, Ethne, come down
from there, please.

70
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:37,190
Not until you dance with me,
Harry.

71
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,950
Oh, dear, yes, come down, Ethne.

72
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,390
- For God's sake, be careful.
- Oh, please.

73
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,390
Jack, tell her to get down.

74
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:42,630
When does she ever listen to me?

75
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:44,750
Ethne, listen to Jack, please.

76
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:45,950
Relax, Harry.

77
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:46,910
Listen to me.

78
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:48,110
Thank you, Jack.

79
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,110
I will not pirouette.

80
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,350
Dance with me.

81
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,390
Right, right.

82
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,470
- Oh, my God.
- Scary, isn't it, Harry?

83
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,230
Don't be such a bore, Harry.

84
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,910
I'm trying.

85
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:01,870
Ooh! Ooh!

86
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:03,630
Oh!

87
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:04,470
Please be careful, okay?

88
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:05,750
It's not very funny, Ethne.

89
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:06,950
Excuse me, Mr. Faversham, sir.

90
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:11,790
Your father is asking
for you and Miss Eustace.

91
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,030
Oh.

92
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,470
Thank you.

93
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,550
- Sir.
- Sir.

94
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,550
Colonel Sutch.

95
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:22,510
Harry, my boy.

96
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,510
How are you, sir?

97
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:24,510
Well, well. Mum.

98
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:25,510
Colonel Sutch.

99
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,470
I'm sorry to send for you,
my dear.

100
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,830
I was hoping to steal you
for the last dance.

101
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,750
It'd be my pleasure, General.

102
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,390
Your son won't dance with me.

103
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,270
Where were you?

104
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:40,190
Catching a breath of air, sir.

105
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,310
My dear.

106
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:55,910
She is very beautiful, Harry.

107
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,470
Yes, she is, sir.

108
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,150
I was thinking how proud
my father would be

109
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,110
if he were here.

110
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,590
An officer who gave his life
for his country

111
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,830
deserves far more respect
than I do.

112
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,870
I wish I'd met him.

113
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:14,350
Are you ready, my dear?

114
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,950
With all my heart.

115
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:27,790
My lords, ladies and gentlemen,
the general.

116
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:38,550
Dr. Johnson once said

117
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,910
every man feels meanly
about himself

118
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:43,110
for not having been a soldier.

119
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:46,310
Well, that's something
no one here tonight need fear.

120
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:48,630
Whether or not you've seen
active service

121
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:52,710
you have shown yourselves
willing to lay down your lives

122
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,870
and for that...

123
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,670
I salute you.

124
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:59,150
- The Royal Cumbrians!
- The Royal Cumbrians!

125
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:07,270
Now, in my mind, there is
only one sacrifice more noble

126
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:10,070
than pledging one's life
for one's country

127
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:14,350
and that is... loving...

128
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:16,910
and marrying a man who does.

129
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:17,870
- Marry?!
- Marry?!

130
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:21,390
Harry... and Ethne.

131
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:22,870
Harry and Ethne!

132
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:27,910
Bravo!

133
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,950
Bravo! Bravo!

134
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:47,150
Form a square!

135
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,270
Form a square!

136
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:50,990
Well, now that we've had
such a public engagement

137
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:53,470
can we have a nice,
quiet wedding, please?

138
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,870
Not on your life!

139
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:58,030
I want the full works,
the church near my home

140
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:01,030
and then a rousing speech
from your father.

141
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,350
Mm.

142
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:03,310
My father?

143
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,430
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

144
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:06,670
"I'd like
to congratulate my son.

145
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:10,550
When I was his age, I was
in charge of a full regiment."

146
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:12,070
He doesn't sound
anything like that.

147
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,070
Oh, yes, he does.

148
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:15,310
Besides, you will be
in charge of a regiment.

149
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:23,310
Quiet!

150
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,390
It'll be Jack and Isabelle's
turn next.

151
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:26,190
Jack? Oh, no,
Jack will never get married.

152
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,430
He's too much of a soldier.

153
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,310
So are you.

154
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,350
Yes, but not like him.

155
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:34,550
Yes, you are, more than him,
more than any of them.

156
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,710
You're my husband.

157
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,390
Good night, ladies

158
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:40,550
Good night, ladies...

159
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:41,670
Go away.

160
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:42,870
Please, ignore them.

161
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,310
Don't act like children!

162
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:47,790
Merrily, we roll along,
roll along, roll along

163
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:50,670
Merrily, we roll along
until the morning comes

164
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,990
Good night, gentlemen,
good night, gentlemen...

165
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,910
Good night, Ethne!

166
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:58,190
Good night, Harry!

167
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:02,110
Good night, Ethne,
we have to take him home!

168
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,070
Hyah! Hyah!

169
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,190
Come on, Harry, keep up!

170
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,910
Come on, John!

171
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:34,510
Come on, Mr. Castleton,
get it out!

172
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:35,630
Mr. Trench, carry on!

173
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:38,470
Mr. Castleton's dead...
enemy spear through the foot!

174
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,510
Come on, get a move on!

175
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:40,910
Get it out!

176
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:44,510
Come on, let's go! Come on!

177
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,670
Gentlemen, the colonel!

178
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,350
Gentlemen.

179
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:11,670
I have some news.

180
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:16,150
An army of Muhammadan fanatics
under the command

181
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:20,150
of their self-proclaimed
messiah, the Mahdi

182
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:24,390
has attacked a British fortress
in the Sudan.

183
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,710
Our forces there fought a heroic

184
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:29,790
but in the end hopeless,
rearguard action.

185
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:34,790
They were slaughtered to a man.

186
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:37,990
As a result of these hostilities

187
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:42,710
several regiments,
including the Royal Cumbrians

188
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:46,710
will be shipping out
to the Sudan within the week.

189
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:49,750
Congratulations to you all.

190
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:53,710
This government
has finally seen fit

191
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,430
to send its soldiers to war.

192
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,190
Finally, we're off.

193
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:05,990
Gentlemen.

194
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:12,630
God has endowed

195
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:14,470
the British race

196
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:17,110
with a worldwide empire

197
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:19,790
that they may execute

198
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:22,550
His sovereign purpose
in the world.

199
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:25,110
The victories you will have
over the heathen

200
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:31,430
are the victories
of the nobler soul in man.

201
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:35,430
- God save the queen.
- God save the queen!

202
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:45,870
All together!

203
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:49,030
This is what nerves do
to grown men.

204
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:53,230
If we're going to go to war,
I wish we'd just get on with it.

205
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:55,750
Do you ever think
about what it's going to be like

206
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,990
when we get there?

207
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,950
All the time.

208
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:01,510
Don't you?

209
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,150
I sometimes wonder

210
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:06,310
what a godforsaken desert
in the middle of nowhere

211
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:08,030
has to do
with Her Majesty the queen.

212
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,950
What's going on?

213
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:12,950
What happened?

214
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:15,670
Aren't you afraid
you won't come back?

215
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:19,950
Did you have a bad dream
about me or something?

216
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:22,870
Did I get my head lopped off
by one of those Mahdi savages?

217
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:25,350
Yes, Jack.

218
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,990
Of course, I'm scared.

219
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:29,390
Then, what...

220
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,430
...what makes you go?

221
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:37,550
I suppose... I'm going

222
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:38,910
because you're going...

223
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:43,510
you, Trench, Castleton,
even Willoughby...

224
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:46,110
but especially you.

225
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:50,910
There's no one
I'd sooner trust my life with.

226
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:48,750
What is this?

227
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,630
My papers, sir.

228
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:53,710
If it's leave you want,
there's a different procedure.

229
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:56,790
Normally I wouldn't consider it
in the circumstances

230
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:58,990
but given that you've
just got engaged...

231
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:00,150
It isn't leave I want, sir.

232
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:05,630
I wish to resign my commission.

233
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:13,390
If I were you,
I'd think very carefully

234
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:15,750
about what
you're saying, Lieutenant.

235
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:18,150
I've made up my mind, sir.

236
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:22,710
We'll talk about this when
you've spoken with your father.

237
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:26,310
It isn't his decision, sir.

238
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:29,390
I do not accept
these papers, Lieutenant

239
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:31,630
and I do not accept
that one of my men

240
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:32,870
would walk out
on his regiment...

241
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:33,990
- Sir...
...the very week

242
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,550
we are shipping off to war!

243
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:43,910
Now, as far as I'm concerned,
you were never here.

244
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:46,630
You can thank
your father for that.

245
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,630
Sir...

246
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:56,190
I wish to resign my commission.

247
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:03,030
Please leave
these barracks immediately.

248
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,390
Whoa!

249
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:33,510
Hello, Miss Willoughby!

250
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,110
I thought I could smell

251
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:37,630
the scent of fresh roses
in the air.

252
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:38,910
Harry's resigned.

253
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:39,950
Resigned what?

254
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,710
His bloody commission,
what do you think?

255
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,710
What did Hamilton do?

256
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,270
Refuse him leave to marry Ethne?

257
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,710
Hamilton didn't do anything.

258
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,070
There was no excuse for it.

259
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:51,190
"Excuse for it"?

260
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,710
You're talking about Harry.

261
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,470
He's right, Tom.
He's just got engaged.

262
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,190
It's perfectly natural
to have doubts.

263
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:58,990
We're sent to war, and
the very next day he resigns?

264
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,470
There's no doubt about it.

265
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,750
What's that supposed to mean?

266
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:02,830
I think it's perfectly clear
what it means.

267
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:04,470
- Tom, don't be absurd.
- Shut up, Vicar.

268
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,910
It means he's a coward, Jack.

269
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:12,790
Then say that to his face.

270
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:13,990
I would've done

271
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:16,430
only he left the barracks
before I had a chance.

272
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,710
All right, then,
say it to my face.

273
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:19,910
Easy, Jack.

274
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,750
Harry's a disgrace!

275
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:27,910
He's disgraced the regiment!

276
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:28,710
Jack!

277
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,310
He's the best soldier
in the regiment!

278
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:32,390
Obviously not when it counts.

279
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:35,910
Get off!

280
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,630
I will tell him

281
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,830
but not to his face...
he doesn't deserve it.

282
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,030
He deserves to be treated

283
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:44,070
with the same contempt
that he treated us.

284
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:45,070
What contempt?

285
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,190
Did he talk to you about it?

286
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:49,790
Did he talk to any of you?

287
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:50,950
He's left our backs exposed

288
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:52,950
and he doesn't even have
the courage to tell us.

289
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,950
He was my friend, too, Jack.

290
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:11,150
He'll be there.

291
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:21,190
This has to be answered.

292
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:42,510
Do you, Harry Faversham

293
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:46,550
take this woman to be
your lawful, wedded wife?

294
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:48,990
Yes, and you may kiss the bride.

295
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,230
You can't jump ahead like that.

296
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,590
You have to let me enjoy
my wedding.

297
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,550
Oh.

298
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:54,390
It's your fault we won't be able

299
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:56,710
to do the real one
for another six months.

300
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,430
There's no reason why
we can't get married

301
00:19:58,510 --> 00:19:59,550
whenever we like, is there?

302
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:00,550
I've heard that before.

303
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,790
I've left the army.

304
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:08,950
No, Ethne, I...
I have... left the army.

305
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,230
Why?

306
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:25,550
Well, there was talk
they may send us abroad...

307
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:27,510
for a year or two.

308
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:33,550
I didn't want to wait that long
to get married.

309
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:37,630
Well, I would've waited...

310
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:39,550
or come with you.

311
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:41,830
My mother did the same
for my father.

312
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:44,870
Yes, I know, but it isn't
what I wanted for us.

313
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:50,550
You're all that matters
to me now.

314
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:55,070
Where were they going
to send you?

315
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,110
They weren't sure.

316
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,790
Mr. Faversham.

317
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:01,350
Is this your friends' idea
of a joke?

318
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:03,350
What is it, Harry?

319
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,990
Feathers of... of cowardice.

320
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:15,110
Yesterday, we... were informed

321
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:17,350
that our regiment
would be shipping out

322
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:19,310
to the Sudan...

323
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:24,270
...that we would be...
sent to war.

324
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:26,390
You don't know where
they were sending you...

325
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,950
you said so yourself...
and you did it for me.

326
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,430
- Ethne...
- Nobody in their right minds

327
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:33,030
could call you a coward,
especially not your friends.

328
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:35,190
There's been some kind
of misunderstanding.

329
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,070
You have to clear it up.

330
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:39,270
You have to go back
to the regiment and clear it up.

331
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,270
No, I can't.

332
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,350
Then I will.

333
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:44,790
I'll go see Trent, Willoughby
and Castleton myself

334
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:47,590
and tell them it's
my fault you resigned

335
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:48,590
that you did it for me.

336
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:51,310
It has nothing to do with you,
Ethne!

337
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:57,230
Then why?

338
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:03,550
I never wanted to join the army!

339
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:12,150
I did it for my father.

340
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:15,030
I thought I'd serve out
my commission

341
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:15,990
in a year or two

342
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:18,550
keep everyone happy,
and then I could just...

343
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:21,510
You'd what, wait till we were
married to tell me the truth?

344
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:24,550
No, Ethne, l-I never meant
to lie to you.

345
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:27,750
No, but you were quite happy
to let me deceive myself.

346
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:31,630
Do you think people
will let us forget this?

347
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:34,990
I don't care
what people think, Ethne.

348
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:37,110
All I care about is us.

349
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:40,790
It's not about us, Harry.

350
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:44,230
It's not just about us.

351
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:45,190
What about Jack?

352
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,950
He would give his life for you.

353
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:48,430
Don't you think I know that?

354
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,790
Then go back.

355
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:52,110
It's not too late.

356
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:54,590
Tell them
you wouldn't have resigned

357
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:56,790
if it weren't for me.

358
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:59,110
I would... have resigned...

359
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:07,470
...and I wouldn't have gone
to war for anything or anyone.

360
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:14,310
Then you are a coward.

361
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:35,830
Fight for England!

362
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:51,950
"Avoid drinking local water
and spirits

363
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:54,470
"avoid local barrooms
and brothels

364
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:58,550
and, above all, remember,
you're a Christian soldier."

365
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,190
Why'd they give this to me?

366
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,750
It must be for you, Vicar.

367
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:16,550
Father?

368
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,430
After you.

369
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,790
May I speak with you, sir?

370
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,670
I don't know you.

371
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,710
I need to speak with you, sir.

372
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:03,110
British attack
the City of Korti!

373
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:06,630
British casualties in the Sudan!

374
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:48,710
Something wrong, Jack?

375
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:02,830
Well, I don't know about you lot

376
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:05,710
but I'm going to get a drink
before Mustafa does.

377
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:09,910
It's probably poisoned.

378
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:17,350
Mustafa, after you, mate.

379
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:25,110
- Take cover!
- Stay down!

380
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:27,030
Take cover! Take cover!

381
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,030
Where is he?

382
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,190
Get down and stay down!

383
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:30,590
- Get down!
- Take cover!

384
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:31,310
Where is he?

385
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:33,230
Where is he?

386
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,390
Take cover!

387
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:35,870
Stay down!
Stay down, everyone!

388
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:39,910
Find him! Find him!
Where the bloody hell is he?

389
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:40,950
He's on the roof!

390
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,150
- Where?!
- Over there!

391
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:43,510
Over there!

392
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:50,470
Get him!

393
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:02,350
Now!

394
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:07,590
- Move!
- Right, sir.

395
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:38,510
Hey!

396
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:43,310
Put the gun down.

397
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:46,830
Put the gun down.

398
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:56,230
Put the gun down!

399
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:09,950
Tell him to put the gun down!

400
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:15,790
Put your gun down!

401
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:21,030
For God sakes, man,
put your gun down!

402
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:28,830
Don't.

403
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:33,270
Hold your fire.

404
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:37,510
Put the gun down.

405
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,710
Tell him to put his gun down!

406
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:41,990
Don't! Don't! Don't!

407
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:29,190
What's done is done, Harry.

408
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:29,910
No, sir

409
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:31,430
it isn't.

410
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:33,510
Something like this happens...

411
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:38,150
...and you're lost.

412
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:41,870
You don't know

413
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:44,830
who you are anymore
or what you're capable of.

414
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:49,470
Unless I do something...

415
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:53,830
this is how people will
always remember me...

416
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:55,470
a feather...

417
00:30:55,550 --> 00:31:00,270
and that is
how I will always see myself...

418
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:02,190
a coward.

419
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:06,790
All I know is I can't live
with myself like this.

420
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:12,870
Who gave you the fourth feather?

421
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:15,470
Jack Durrance?

422
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,670
No, sir.

423
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,630
Ethne did.

424
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:39,910
Dearest Ethne:

425
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:42,910
Forgive me for all the shame
I've caused you.

426
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:45,190
I can only imagine
the indignities

427
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:47,390
you must have suffered
because of me.

428
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:00,430
I hope my leaving London will
at least allow you

429
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:04,270
to begin your life again,
free of my shadow.

430
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:07,390
I have no right to your trust
or claim to your love

431
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:10,630
but please believe,
I never set out to deceive you.

432
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:12,550
I don't know

433
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:15,790
if an opportunity will ever
arise to redeem myself

434
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:17,710
but I have to believe it will

435
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:19,190
and I have to believe

436
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,790
that this time
I'll face up to my fears

437
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:25,950
and prove to myself and others,
I'm not a coward.

438
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:28,190
What did he pay you
to bring him here?

439
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:30,350
Listen, Gustave,
I wouldn't bring...

440
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:32,270
Take this.

441
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:34,950
Now get out.

442
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:36,630
Don't come back.

443
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:41,630
What do you want?

444
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:44,870
Can you take me
to the British camp at Korti?

445
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:47,110
Across the desert?

446
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:49,190
Yes.

447
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:50,270
Why?

448
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:58,190
Can you take me there or not?

449
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:05,710
For your time.

450
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:10,310
Can you speak Arabic?

451
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:11,950
I can learn.

452
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:13,830
Yes, but can you learn
to look like an Arab?

453
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:16,510
If the Mahdi's men find you...

454
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:20,390
I'm taking a caravan of whores
up to Korti next week.

455
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:22,350
Come and see me then.

456
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:26,390
Left, right, left, right,
left, right, left.

457
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:27,510
Thank you.

458
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:30,390
Left, right, left, right,
left, right, left.

459
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:31,830
Congratulations, Jack.

460
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:33,710
I've decided
to give you a few weeks' leave.

461
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:37,230
Every report I receive
singles you out for praise.

462
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:42,550
You and several other officers
will be going to London

463
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:43,790
to convince Parliament

464
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:45,910
and the public opinion
that it's high time

465
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:47,830
this government ordered us
out of Korti

466
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:50,070
to rescue General Gordon.

467
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:52,430
With your permission, I'd rather
stay here with the regiment.

468
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:53,430
Why?

469
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:55,230
I don't feel
I've done my duty yet.

470
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:57,230
I wouldn't want
to let the others down.

471
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:59,910
Permission refused.

472
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:02,230
Sir, why me?

473
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:04,470
Because you're a hero, Jack.

474
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:06,390
With all due respect, sir

475
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:09,190
I don't think
we've been fighting long enough

476
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:11,430
to have any heroes
in this campaign.

477
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,150
Shut up!

478
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:33,550
Keep them quiet, Saadi!
What do I pay you for?!

479
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:48,350
They are princesses.

480
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:49,590
Can you imagine

481
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,390
even the savages have royalty?

482
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:52,630
But the British soldiers

483
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:54,590
pay me three dirham
an hour for them.

484
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:56,590
Well worth the trip to Korti.

485
00:34:56,670 --> 00:35:00,110
Is this the Mahdi's territory?

486
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:02,830
Everywhere is Mahdi territory.

487
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:31,950
- Mm.
- Mm.

488
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:36,150
What is it?

489
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:37,390
She doesn't like my manners?

490
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:53,270
Savage!

491
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:54,910
Stop it!

492
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:57,830
You're not to look at me!

493
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:00,070
Stop!

494
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:01,390
Stop doing this!

495
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:03,870
Stop it! Stop it!

496
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:05,350
Stop it!

497
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:06,990
I'll teach you manners!

498
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:09,270
Stop it! Enough!

499
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:11,350
That'll teach you manners!

500
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:14,110
Enough!

501
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:26,830
You think she'll thank you
for what you did today?

502
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:29,190
I don't expect her to.

503
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:31,470
Of course you do;
you saved her life.

504
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:33,950
Tsk, tsk! Tsk!

505
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:46,750
They're like children.

506
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:50,190
They have no concept
of gratitude or loyalty.

507
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:54,230
That's something you British
don't understand.

508
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:58,310
You come here,
trying to civilize them

509
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:01,350
with your Christian values.

510
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:19,390
Now, she'll thank you.

511
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:28,390
Don't be so proud, my friend.

512
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:30,750
There are followers of the Mahdi
everywhere in the Sudan.

513
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:34,230
The rebel tribes are gathering
forces under the leadership

514
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:36,470
of the Mahdi to fight us.

515
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:38,630
We do not need
more reinforcements.

516
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:40,710
All we need is
for this government

517
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:42,310
to give an order to march

518
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:44,350
and we will route the enemy

519
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:47,190
and preserve the dignity
of our empire.

520
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:55,270
Have you heard from Harry?

521
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:56,430
No.

522
00:39:58,510 --> 00:39:59,990
Have you?

523
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:02,150
No.

524
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:05,990
Ethne, you can't blame yourself.

525
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,270
You make a stupid mistake

526
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:09,590
and you pay for it
for the rest of your life.

527
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:12,830
I can't forgive myself.

528
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,310
You had your reasons.

529
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:16,550
What reasons?

530
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:17,830
Pride?

531
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:22,390
Because I was afraid
of what people would say.

532
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:26,190
What do I care what people said?

533
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:27,510
I loved him.

534
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:29,430
Ethne, you have to...

535
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,270
He came to me, Jack.

536
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:35,430
He came to me
and I turned him away.

537
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:37,510
It's all right.

538
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:42,150
It won't be like this
for the rest of your life.

539
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:46,350
I'll write to you when I'm gone.

540
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:09,830
Left, right, left, right,
left, right, left.

541
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:13,950
Left, right, left,
right, left, right, left.

542
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:18,230
Left, right, left, right,
left, right, left, right

543
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:20,190
left, right, stop!

544
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:17,310
Referee, come on!

545
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:18,390
That wasn't fair!

546
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:27,470
Congratulations!

547
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:51,830
Open up.

548
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:53,430
He's got no teeth.
Get rid of him.

549
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:55,350
Who's next?!

550
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:56,830
Come on, keep 'em coming,
keep 'em coming.

551
00:43:56,910 --> 00:43:59,270
No, he's too small.

552
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:03,750
I want to see
this man's teeth.

553
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:06,550
He looks strong enough.

554
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:08,950
Put him
with the baggage porters.

555
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:10,590
How many more we got?
How many, Bill?

556
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:13,550
Okay, we need
another three of them.

557
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:17,510
What's going on?!

558
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:19,470
This man comes
from a tribe of slaves.

559
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:21,470
The men will not serve
with him, sir.

560
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:23,870
Look, we need all the help
we can get.

561
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:25,310
Baggage porter!

562
00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:28,030
Get him through.

563
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:29,430
I can't believe it.

564
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:31,510
Come on. Come on.
Get him through.

565
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:32,990
Come on, next.

566
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:35,430
My Dearest Jack:

567
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:38,430
I was so relieved
to receive your last letter.

568
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:40,950
While the whole country
is celebrating

569
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:42,670
your campaign against the Mahdi

570
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:45,190
all I feel is dread
and all I think about are

571
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:49,590
the precious times we spent
together: you, Harry, and I.

572
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:51,430
My father used to say

573
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:54,350
that God takes away
what's dearest to our hearts

574
00:44:54,430 --> 00:44:57,150
to remind us
how much we take for granted.

575
00:44:57,230 --> 00:45:00,750
Now that it's too late,
I wish I could turn back time.

576
00:45:00,830 --> 00:45:04,150
How differently I'd do things
given a second chance.

577
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:06,270
Take good care of yourself,
Jack.

578
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:09,670
I don't mind if you don't
come back covered in glory.

579
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:11,950
Just come back safely.

580
00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:14,750
Your friend forever, Ethne.

581
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:27,510
Thoughtful of General Wolseley

582
00:45:27,590 --> 00:45:29,830
to give us these umbrellas,
eh, Vicar?

583
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:31,790
I burn in the sun.

584
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:54,150
Come on, now, faster!

585
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:55,230
Faster!

586
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:06,030
Watch out!

587
00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:15,150
Abou Fatma.

588
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:21,510
My name is Abou Fatma.

589
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:22,590
Vedu.

590
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:26,790
I was a scout for General Hicks.

591
00:47:29,870 --> 00:47:33,030
There are many in this camp
who serve the Mahdi.

592
00:47:33,110 --> 00:47:36,710
When they find out there's
a British spy amongst them

593
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:39,470
watching them, they'll kill him.

594
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:42,670
It won't be long, Vedu.

595
00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:54,630
Why would you warn me?

596
00:47:59,830 --> 00:48:00,830
For money.

597
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:02,070
I can't pay you.

598
00:48:04,430 --> 00:48:06,150
What's the feather for?

599
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:13,870
First time I killed a man.

600
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:20,030
Five men.

601
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:22,670
Wait.

602
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:28,990
Ten men.

603
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:30,190
This...

604
00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:33,030
I will wear soon.

605
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:39,750
I'm a good soldier.

606
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:41,510
I... will protect you.

607
00:48:57,630 --> 00:49:00,870
Who did this?! Who did this?!

608
00:49:02,030 --> 00:49:03,990
Who did this?!

609
00:49:10,350 --> 00:49:13,550
Who did this?!

610
00:49:39,230 --> 00:49:41,510
Keep your eyes to the front.

611
00:49:47,270 --> 00:49:50,470
Why would a British spy
be hiding from his own soldiers?

612
00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:52,230
I'm not a spy.

613
00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:50,630
Is that the same letter
you read over and over again

614
00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:53,310
or do you get a different one
each day?

615
00:50:55,630 --> 00:50:57,390
He writes them to himself.

616
00:50:58,950 --> 00:51:00,350
Read us a line.

617
00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:01,950
Read your own.

618
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:03,110
Don't be so coy.

619
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:04,750
You're amongst friends.

620
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:07,910
Come on, Jack, you can trust us.

621
00:51:15,790 --> 00:51:19,270
"I'm so glad I came to hear you
speak that day in London."

622
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:23,750
Come on, more than that.

623
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:26,150
Don't leave us hanging on...
elaborate.

624
00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:37,190
"It made me realize how much
your friendship means to me.

625
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:43,870
"Come back safely and soon...

626
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:45,550
my dearest Jack."

627
00:51:48,510 --> 00:51:50,470
Ooh!

628
00:51:50,550 --> 00:51:52,590
Well, well done,
"my dearest Jack"!

629
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:53,990
Who's the lucky lady?

630
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:55,910
Ethne.

631
00:51:59,270 --> 00:52:00,710
I'm going to ask her
to marry me.

632
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:18,190
Congratulations, Jack.

633
00:52:18,270 --> 00:52:19,230
That's fantastic, Jack.

634
00:52:19,310 --> 00:52:20,830
She hasn't said yes.

635
00:52:20,910 --> 00:52:22,950
Aah, she will.

636
00:52:22,990 --> 00:52:25,150
"I realize how much
I bloody love you."

637
00:52:25,230 --> 00:52:27,310
"How much your friendship
means to me."

638
00:52:27,390 --> 00:52:28,590
Same thing.

639
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:31,190
Cheers, Jack.

640
00:52:35,350 --> 00:52:36,590
Congratulations, Jack.

641
00:52:58,950 --> 00:53:00,990
They look like the Mahdi's men.

642
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:03,270
I need to find out
where he's going.

643
00:53:05,230 --> 00:53:06,790
Deserters, sir.

644
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:19,830
Corporal, cease fire!

645
00:53:25,630 --> 00:53:27,270
Harry.

646
00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:39,230
Looks like they've stopped
for the night.

647
00:53:44,710 --> 00:53:47,350
Why is it so important
to follow them?

648
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:49,950
The Mahdi spies will report
on our troop movements.

649
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:51,110
Not the spies...

650
00:53:53,150 --> 00:53:54,710
...your friends.

651
00:53:58,870 --> 00:54:02,510
To help them... if I can.

652
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:10,110
Are you a deserter?

653
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:17,870
Something like that.

654
00:54:22,990 --> 00:54:25,510
I was sent to fight,
and I ran away.

655
00:54:29,110 --> 00:54:30,430
Why?

656
00:54:32,110 --> 00:54:33,670
Why?

657
00:54:36,110 --> 00:54:38,630
Well...

658
00:54:38,670 --> 00:54:40,510
I just...

659
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:45,310
There are many reasons why.

660
00:54:51,270 --> 00:54:53,150
Mostly, I was afraid.

661
00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:11,630
I found you half dead...

662
00:55:12,590 --> 00:55:14,310
...crossing the desert alone.

663
00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:18,750
You say you are afraid?

664
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:27,990
It's a different kind of fear.

665
00:55:37,590 --> 00:55:39,790
Why are you protecting me?

666
00:55:42,670 --> 00:55:44,430
God put you in my way.

667
00:55:44,510 --> 00:55:46,630
I have no choice.

668
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:48,430
God?

669
00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:55,270
Hmm.

670
00:55:55,350 --> 00:55:59,270
An Englishman and a Christian.

671
00:56:02,110 --> 00:56:04,710
You must've done something
terrible to offend him.

672
00:56:14,030 --> 00:56:15,510
You laugh like an Englishman.

673
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:21,590
And how does
an Englishman laugh?

674
00:56:45,710 --> 00:56:47,470
Abou...

675
00:56:47,550 --> 00:56:49,430
they're leaving!

676
00:56:51,630 --> 00:56:52,670
They're getting away.

677
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:55,550
We can't lose them.

678
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:06,110
All right, I'll...

679
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:08,710
I'll just sit here
and wait for you.

680
00:57:10,350 --> 00:57:12,150
Take your time.

681
00:57:15,550 --> 00:57:16,830
Oh.

682
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:45,990
That is the fortress
of Abou Clea.

683
00:57:46,070 --> 00:57:49,310
The British reinforcements
are stationed there.

684
00:57:49,390 --> 00:57:52,710
Why would the spies be going
to a British fort?

685
00:59:02,430 --> 00:59:07,310
The fort has been taken over
by the Mahdi's army.

686
00:59:07,390 --> 00:59:09,950
But this is where
our troops are heading.

687
00:59:36,150 --> 00:59:36,950
Abou!

688
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:41,710
Abou, warn my friends.

689
01:00:54,670 --> 01:00:56,630
Company, halt!

690
01:00:56,710 --> 01:01:01,270
- Company, halt!
- Company, halt!

691
01:01:01,350 --> 01:01:03,630
Hyah! Hyah!

692
01:01:03,710 --> 01:01:07,190
Hyah, hyah, hyah, hyah.

693
01:01:07,270 --> 01:01:08,950
Hyah.

694
01:01:09,030 --> 01:01:10,710
Whoa!

695
01:01:20,230 --> 01:01:21,750
God...

696
01:01:28,270 --> 01:01:30,470
Hyah! Hyah!

697
01:01:30,510 --> 01:01:31,150
Mr. Trench!

698
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:33,350
William!

699
01:01:33,430 --> 01:01:34,950
Get away from them!

700
01:01:35,030 --> 01:01:35,750
Leave them alone!

701
01:01:35,790 --> 01:01:36,790
You filthy...

702
01:01:36,870 --> 01:01:37,750
Sir?

703
01:01:37,830 --> 01:01:39,070
You leave
these bloody men alone!

704
01:01:39,150 --> 01:01:41,190
Hyah! Hyah!

705
01:01:41,270 --> 01:01:42,630
Come back here!

706
01:01:45,990 --> 01:01:48,150
Go on!

707
01:02:03,990 --> 01:02:06,510
Oh...

708
01:02:17,710 --> 01:02:18,750
Sir.

709
01:02:18,830 --> 01:02:21,950
The Egyptians have captured
an enemy scout.

710
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:28,790
Where did you find this man?

711
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:30,270
I came to you myself.

712
01:02:30,350 --> 01:02:33,510
The Mahdi's men have captured
your fort at Abou Clea.

713
01:02:33,590 --> 01:02:34,750
This man is lying, sir.

714
01:02:34,830 --> 01:02:36,630
He's the one who stole
the camels...

715
01:02:36,710 --> 01:02:37,750
They will attack you here!

716
01:02:42,830 --> 01:02:45,310
Tell him a British garrison
would never fall

717
01:02:45,390 --> 01:02:46,630
to the Mahdi savages!

718
01:02:48,590 --> 01:02:50,630
Ask him if he knows the penalty
for being a spy.

719
01:02:50,670 --> 01:02:52,350
I'm not a spy.

720
01:02:52,430 --> 01:02:55,150
The Mahdi's men have left
these bodies to keep you here.

721
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:58,030
Tell him I'll bury him alive
if he speaks another word

722
01:02:58,110 --> 01:02:59,150
of English!

723
01:02:59,230 --> 01:03:01,710
Ask him who sent him here
and why.

724
01:03:11,190 --> 01:03:13,270
He says a British officer
sent him, sir.

725
01:03:13,350 --> 01:03:14,430
A general, no doubt.

726
01:03:14,510 --> 01:03:15,630
What was his name?

727
01:03:24,270 --> 01:03:25,190
Come here, son.

728
01:03:25,230 --> 01:03:26,990
I'll show you
a British officer.

729
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:29,430
This is a British officer!

730
01:03:29,510 --> 01:03:32,230
And this...
is a British officer's blood.

731
01:03:32,310 --> 01:03:34,710
Now lick it up...
every bloody drop!

732
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:42,190
Look! Don't be rash!

733
01:03:42,310 --> 01:03:42,990
Take him away.

734
01:03:43,070 --> 01:03:44,470
Find out why the enemy sent him.

735
01:03:44,550 --> 01:03:45,590
Use any means necessary.

736
01:03:45,670 --> 01:03:49,710
The Muslims always bury
their dead, even the enemy dead.

737
01:03:49,790 --> 01:03:52,630
These bodies have been
left here for a reason!

738
01:03:54,190 --> 01:03:55,670
Come on, you!

739
01:03:58,510 --> 01:04:00,950
Look, I think
you should tell Hamilton.

740
01:04:01,030 --> 01:04:01,910
I agree, Tom.

741
01:04:01,990 --> 01:04:03,670
What for?

742
01:04:08,150 --> 01:04:09,590
As a precaution, Tom.

743
01:04:11,070 --> 01:04:12,790
This man was trying
to mislead us.

744
01:04:15,230 --> 01:04:17,630
I've made my decision.

745
01:04:17,710 --> 01:04:19,710
I'm not going to waste
the colonel's time

746
01:04:19,790 --> 01:04:21,390
by sending
some half-naked savage

747
01:04:21,470 --> 01:04:23,110
in front of him
with a tall tale.

748
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:51,670
What is it, Jack?

749
01:04:51,750 --> 01:04:54,230
There's something up.

750
01:04:54,230 --> 01:04:59,310
Thou God, who reigneth
over all the earth

751
01:04:59,310 --> 01:05:01,790
who art the Lord
of all our salvation

752
01:05:01,790 --> 01:05:03,910
give your ear unto my prayer.

753
01:05:03,910 --> 01:05:08,510
Allah!

754
01:05:08,590 --> 01:05:11,390
For Thou art greater
than the common man.

755
01:05:11,470 --> 01:05:13,470
Everything is as you wish it.

756
01:05:13,590 --> 01:05:15,110
Everything is as you will it.

757
01:05:15,230 --> 01:05:19,710
If what we're doing is just...

758
01:05:19,830 --> 01:05:22,110
then give us the strength
to serve you

759
01:05:22,230 --> 01:05:25,590
for that which I greatly feared
has come upon me...

760
01:05:27,870 --> 01:05:31,510
...and that which I was
afraid of is come unto me.

761
01:05:39,110 --> 01:05:39,870
Form a line.

762
01:05:40,070 --> 01:05:42,750
First company...
a section, if you please.

763
01:05:47,910 --> 01:05:50,590
One section will fix bayonets.

764
01:05:50,710 --> 01:05:51,830
Fix!

765
01:05:55,990 --> 01:05:57,990
Ready!

766
01:05:57,990 --> 01:05:59,510
Present!

767
01:06:02,990 --> 01:06:04,310
- Fire.
- Fire.

768
01:06:04,430 --> 01:06:05,470
Fire!

769
01:06:05,470 --> 01:06:06,830
Reload!

770
01:06:09,990 --> 01:06:10,950
100 yards!

771
01:06:10,950 --> 01:06:12,950
Present!

772
01:06:13,030 --> 01:06:14,310
They're not armed, sir.

773
01:06:14,390 --> 01:06:15,630
- Fire.
- Fire.

774
01:06:15,710 --> 01:06:16,310
Fire!

775
01:06:19,470 --> 01:06:20,910
What in God's name
are they doing?

776
01:06:24,830 --> 01:06:26,870
Present!

777
01:06:29,070 --> 01:06:30,030
- Fire.
- Fire.

778
01:06:30,030 --> 01:06:31,830
Fire!

779
01:06:36,270 --> 01:06:37,310
50 yards!

780
01:06:38,670 --> 01:06:39,990
Present!

781
01:06:44,790 --> 01:06:46,910
- Fire.
- Fire.

782
01:06:46,990 --> 01:06:48,150
Fire!

783
01:06:58,870 --> 01:07:00,710
Thank you, Mr. Willoughby.

784
01:07:00,710 --> 01:07:02,150
Thank you, Sergeant.

785
01:07:02,230 --> 01:07:04,430
Order... up!

786
01:07:05,870 --> 01:07:08,950
Soldier... arm!

787
01:07:08,950 --> 01:07:12,310
Left turn.

788
01:07:12,390 --> 01:07:15,110
Left, right, left!

789
01:07:47,110 --> 01:07:49,990
- Form square!
- Form square!

790
01:08:18,190 --> 01:08:20,310
Form square!

791
01:08:20,310 --> 01:08:23,190
Bring over those camels!
Line them up!

792
01:08:23,270 --> 01:08:25,390
Quickly now, take positions!

793
01:08:29,990 --> 01:08:31,910
Number Three Section, fall in!

794
01:08:39,110 --> 01:08:39,950
Steady.

795
01:08:40,070 --> 01:08:42,190
Steady, boys, steady!

796
01:08:42,190 --> 01:08:44,390
Be calm.

797
01:08:46,190 --> 01:08:48,310
Nice and calm.

798
01:08:55,990 --> 01:08:57,030
Be nice and calm.

799
01:08:59,710 --> 01:09:01,270
Battalion prepare the cavalry,
Mr. Willoughby.

800
01:09:01,350 --> 01:09:02,310
Battalion, prepare the cavalry.

801
01:09:02,510 --> 01:09:04,510
Make way for the cavalry!

802
01:09:07,190 --> 01:09:09,430
Number One Company,
prepare for volley.

803
01:09:09,510 --> 01:09:11,430
Number One Company,
two rounds volley fire!

804
01:09:11,430 --> 01:09:14,670
Number One Company...

805
01:09:14,670 --> 01:09:17,550
two rounds volley fire!

806
01:09:21,310 --> 01:09:23,230
Steady on the right,
Mr. Castleton!

807
01:09:27,710 --> 01:09:28,790
Pick your targets!

808
01:09:44,710 --> 01:09:45,550
Fire!

809
01:09:48,910 --> 01:09:49,590
Fire!

810
01:09:50,830 --> 01:09:51,910
Fire!

811
01:09:56,390 --> 01:09:59,870
Sir, we're being attacked
from behind, sir!

812
01:10:03,510 --> 01:10:05,630
Close in on the right,
Castleton!

813
01:10:08,190 --> 01:10:11,070
Officers to the front!

814
01:10:11,070 --> 01:10:12,990
Present...

815
01:10:13,110 --> 01:10:14,230
aim...

816
01:10:14,230 --> 01:10:16,070
Castleton!

817
01:10:16,070 --> 01:10:16,630
...fire!

818
01:10:20,190 --> 01:10:21,150
Fire!

819
01:10:30,070 --> 01:10:31,990
Keep your horses a target!

820
01:10:32,070 --> 01:10:33,510
Hold this line!

821
01:10:46,670 --> 01:10:49,150
The British Cavalry, sir!

822
01:10:51,630 --> 01:10:53,190
They're retreating!

823
01:10:55,190 --> 01:10:56,830
They're running!

824
01:10:57,790 --> 01:10:59,710
All right, men, cease fire!

825
01:10:59,710 --> 01:11:01,830
Cease fire!

826
01:11:03,350 --> 01:11:04,590
Cease fire!

827
01:11:04,670 --> 01:11:05,630
Congratulations, sir.

828
01:11:05,750 --> 01:11:06,710
Battle's not over yet.

829
01:11:06,790 --> 01:11:08,350
Yes!

830
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:10,350
We sod 'em off, lads!

831
01:11:10,430 --> 01:11:12,470
Send out the skirmishers,
Mr. Willoughby.

832
01:11:12,550 --> 01:11:13,790
Send out the skirmishers!

833
01:11:13,790 --> 01:11:15,150
Well done, Four Section!

834
01:11:15,230 --> 01:11:16,590
Vicar!

835
01:11:16,670 --> 01:11:18,030
Come on, Vicar!

836
01:11:18,110 --> 01:11:19,270
Vicar, come on!

837
01:11:35,110 --> 01:11:37,390
- Close the square!
- Close the square!

838
01:11:44,110 --> 01:11:45,350
Charge!

839
01:12:18,710 --> 01:12:21,310
Deliver me from
blood guiltiness, O God.

840
01:12:55,750 --> 01:13:00,630
It's not the British!
It's the Mahdi!

841
01:13:06,790 --> 01:13:08,710
Get back!

842
01:13:31,030 --> 01:13:33,430
Volley fire, if you please,
Mr. Willoughby!

843
01:13:33,550 --> 01:13:35,350
The skirmishers, sir?

844
01:13:35,350 --> 01:13:37,190
Hold this square at all costs

845
01:13:37,270 --> 01:13:38,030
Mr. Willoughby!

846
01:13:40,150 --> 01:13:42,750
Get back to the square!
Get back to the square!

847
01:13:45,230 --> 01:13:48,190
Get back to the square! Go!

848
01:13:48,310 --> 01:13:52,430
Get back to the square! Go! Go!

849
01:13:52,510 --> 01:13:53,870
Vicar!

850
01:13:53,950 --> 01:13:55,990
...my sins deliver before me!

851
01:13:56,070 --> 01:13:57,990
Volley fire, Mr. Willoughby!

852
01:13:58,070 --> 01:13:59,430
Now!

853
01:14:04,110 --> 01:14:06,510
Mr. Willoughby,
I gave you a direct order!

854
01:14:07,670 --> 01:14:09,110
Castleton!

855
01:14:16,510 --> 01:14:18,510
Save me from my sins!

856
01:14:20,910 --> 01:14:23,990
Vicar,
get back to the four square!

857
01:14:42,790 --> 01:14:44,510
- Go on, Trench! Go on!
- Run!

858
01:14:46,310 --> 01:14:47,190
Present!

859
01:14:51,510 --> 01:14:52,830
Fire!

860
01:14:57,150 --> 01:14:58,710
Don't shoot!

861
01:15:00,910 --> 01:15:02,430
Come on! Let's go!

862
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:07,150
Vicar!

863
01:15:16,710 --> 01:15:17,990
Close the square!

864
01:15:18,070 --> 01:15:19,590
Close the square!

865
01:15:19,710 --> 01:15:21,310
Mr. Willoughby...

866
01:15:38,390 --> 01:15:41,390
Jack!

867
01:15:44,630 --> 01:15:47,790
What are your orders, sir?

868
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:48,670
Sir!

869
01:15:50,310 --> 01:15:51,830
Sound the retreat!

870
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:56,110
"My dear Jack..."

871
01:18:38,710 --> 01:18:39,830
Oh...

872
01:18:48,870 --> 01:18:50,390
I'm a fool.

873
01:18:59,710 --> 01:19:04,510
I was a fool to think
that I could ever go back home.

874
01:19:06,790 --> 01:19:08,030
I can't.

875
01:19:19,270 --> 01:19:21,870
Your friend needs help.

876
01:19:21,950 --> 01:19:24,910
My friend knows
how to help himself.

877
01:19:25,030 --> 01:19:27,310
I can't see.

878
01:19:35,190 --> 01:19:36,910
I can't see.

879
01:19:53,390 --> 01:19:56,950
I can't see!

880
01:20:02,630 --> 01:20:03,590
Oh! Don't!

881
01:20:04,350 --> 01:20:06,630
Don't! Don't! Don't!

882
01:20:08,270 --> 01:20:09,230
Who are you?

883
01:20:09,230 --> 01:20:11,630
I have letters.

884
01:20:29,870 --> 01:20:30,630
Oh...

885
01:20:39,830 --> 01:20:41,150
Who are you?

886
01:20:47,510 --> 01:20:51,230
I can't see. I can't see.

887
01:20:51,350 --> 01:20:52,190
Shh.

888
01:20:54,670 --> 01:20:55,830
I can't see.

889
01:20:55,830 --> 01:20:56,790
Shh.

890
01:21:00,350 --> 01:21:04,870
Shh. Shh...

891
01:21:45,030 --> 01:21:46,870
Hello, Jack.

892
01:21:46,950 --> 01:21:49,270
Ethne.

893
01:22:00,190 --> 01:22:01,910
How are you?

894
01:22:14,190 --> 01:22:16,990
I wanted to ask your advice,
General.

895
01:22:17,070 --> 01:22:19,550
My advice?

896
01:22:19,670 --> 01:22:21,870
Jack Durrance has...

897
01:22:21,950 --> 01:22:23,390
has asked me to marry him.

898
01:22:26,190 --> 01:22:27,630
You don't need my advice.

899
01:22:27,630 --> 01:22:30,790
Jack Durrance is a good man.

900
01:22:34,710 --> 01:22:36,910
I haven't answered him yet.

901
01:22:43,830 --> 01:22:46,310
I was wondering
if you'd heard from Harry.

902
01:22:48,350 --> 01:22:50,070
I've heard nothing

903
01:22:50,150 --> 01:22:53,510
and, uh...

904
01:22:53,630 --> 01:22:55,830
I don't think
I shall hear from him again.

905
01:23:00,230 --> 01:23:03,390
I should've listened.

906
01:23:05,870 --> 01:23:07,990
I miss him.

907
01:23:08,110 --> 01:23:12,990
My son loved Jack Durrance
like a brother.

908
01:23:12,990 --> 01:23:16,550
I know he'd want you
to be happy.

909
01:23:19,390 --> 01:23:23,070
A few more weeks and he'll
be able to ride without help.

910
01:23:23,150 --> 01:23:25,070
Will that be the end
of your penance?

911
01:23:37,830 --> 01:23:38,990
Jack.

912
01:23:39,070 --> 01:23:40,710
Oh-ho-ho-ho.

913
01:23:40,790 --> 01:23:42,150
Not bad.

914
01:23:42,230 --> 01:23:43,750
You should see me on a camel.

915
01:23:48,950 --> 01:23:50,590
Lavender...

916
01:23:50,670 --> 01:23:52,030
and onions.

917
01:23:52,110 --> 01:23:53,950
Sunday lunch.

918
01:23:54,030 --> 01:23:57,670
Take the horse to the stables
and you can have some.

919
01:24:13,710 --> 01:24:15,790
Thank you, Robert,
it's quite all right.

920
01:24:17,430 --> 01:24:18,790
It's me, Jack.

921
01:24:22,150 --> 01:24:23,390
Tom.

922
01:24:42,750 --> 01:24:45,910
They finally made you
captain, Miss Willoughby.

923
01:24:45,910 --> 01:24:47,070
All those decorations.

924
01:24:50,430 --> 01:24:52,070
You must have a few, yourself.

925
01:24:52,150 --> 01:24:54,830
How'd you know
I was visiting today?

926
01:24:54,910 --> 01:24:56,470
l, uh...

927
01:25:01,630 --> 01:25:03,350
I saw Harry, Jack.

928
01:25:09,230 --> 01:25:11,510
Where?

929
01:25:11,630 --> 01:25:14,110
In the Sudan.

930
01:25:17,270 --> 01:25:20,350
I was following our retreat.

931
01:25:20,430 --> 01:25:22,150
We had a terrible time of it.

932
01:25:22,150 --> 01:25:24,070
The enemy hounded us
all the way.

933
01:25:24,190 --> 01:25:26,670
The desert itself
seemed to side with them.

934
01:25:26,750 --> 01:25:29,070
We ran out of water,
medical supplies...

935
01:25:29,150 --> 01:25:31,270
even had
to leave stragglers behind.

936
01:25:31,390 --> 01:25:33,950
Finally, our own native scouts
turned on us.

937
01:25:34,070 --> 01:25:38,190
We lost more men on that retreat
than we did at the battle.

938
01:25:42,990 --> 01:25:44,910
Get out!

939
01:25:47,190 --> 01:25:48,430
Didn't you hear what I said?

940
01:25:48,550 --> 01:25:50,350
I said get out
or I'll have you whipped

941
01:25:50,470 --> 01:25:51,590
you filthy wog!

942
01:25:51,710 --> 01:25:53,430
Like you had my friend whipped?

943
01:26:00,710 --> 01:26:02,070
Harry?

944
01:26:03,990 --> 01:26:05,710
I sent a man to warn you

945
01:26:05,710 --> 01:26:09,350
and you had him tortured
for his pains.

946
01:26:11,830 --> 01:26:13,950
I...

947
01:26:15,790 --> 01:26:17,710
What would it have cost
to listen?

948
01:26:17,790 --> 01:26:19,030
I didn't know it was you.

949
01:26:19,030 --> 01:26:21,070
You should've taken precautions,
Tom.

950
01:26:21,150 --> 01:26:22,310
I didn't know it was you.

951
01:26:26,030 --> 01:26:27,870
For God's sake,
what are you doing here?

952
01:26:44,270 --> 01:26:46,070
And afterwards?

953
01:26:46,070 --> 01:26:50,870
He, uh... he asked me
for some money and left.

954
01:26:50,990 --> 01:26:52,510
To come back?

955
01:26:52,510 --> 01:26:54,230
No.

956
01:26:54,310 --> 01:26:57,310
No, there was a...
there was a rumor going around

957
01:26:57,390 --> 01:26:58,950
that some
of our surviving soldiers

958
01:26:59,030 --> 01:27:00,670
had been captured
and taken to prison.

959
01:27:00,750 --> 01:27:03,430
Harry thought Trench might be
one of them.

960
01:27:03,550 --> 01:27:04,990
He went after him?

961
01:27:05,070 --> 01:27:06,430
I tried to stop him, Jack.

962
01:27:06,510 --> 01:27:08,350
I told him they were only rumors

963
01:27:08,350 --> 01:27:11,990
that the chances of survival
were... virtually none.

964
01:27:12,070 --> 01:27:14,390
He wouldn't listen.

965
01:27:14,470 --> 01:27:19,150
Did you come here
to tell Ethne Harry was dead?

966
01:27:19,270 --> 01:27:21,070
I don't know that he's dead,
Jack.

967
01:27:21,190 --> 01:27:22,990
So you've come to give her hope?

968
01:27:24,430 --> 01:27:26,350
What would you do in my place?

969
01:27:26,470 --> 01:27:31,550
Keep it to myself, Tom,
until I was sure.

970
01:27:49,190 --> 01:27:50,830
What did he say?

971
01:27:50,830 --> 01:27:52,550
Your friend is dead.

972
01:27:52,550 --> 01:27:54,750
I saw Trench taken alive.

973
01:27:54,750 --> 01:27:57,710
Prisoners were taken
to Omdurman last month.

974
01:27:57,830 --> 01:27:59,430
Your army abandoned them.

975
01:27:59,430 --> 01:28:01,350
The shame is no longer yours.

976
01:28:01,470 --> 01:28:04,070
You're responsible
to yourself and to God

977
01:28:04,070 --> 01:28:05,670
not to them.

978
01:28:07,110 --> 01:28:08,950
I am responsible to my friend.

979
01:28:09,030 --> 01:28:10,590
I will find him.

980
01:28:10,670 --> 01:28:12,030
You have learned nothing.

981
01:28:12,110 --> 01:28:13,070
You've done enough.

982
01:28:13,150 --> 01:28:14,390
It's never enough, Abou.

983
01:28:14,510 --> 01:28:16,630
Look, if the Mahdi's men
find out I'm British

984
01:28:16,710 --> 01:28:18,230
they'll take me to their prison.

985
01:28:18,350 --> 01:28:20,150
It's the only way
I'll find my friend.

986
01:28:20,150 --> 01:28:21,510
They will hang you.

987
01:28:21,590 --> 01:28:23,710
Abou, you must help me get
into the prison.

988
01:28:23,790 --> 01:28:26,030
I will not be responsible
for your death.

989
01:28:28,310 --> 01:28:30,990
How could you be responsible
for my death?

990
01:28:34,750 --> 01:28:36,670
I will die if it is God's will.

991
01:28:37,990 --> 01:28:40,990
Yes?

992
01:28:42,990 --> 01:28:46,070
You English walk
too proudly on the earth.

993
01:28:52,950 --> 01:28:55,150
You are a fool...

994
01:28:57,670 --> 01:28:59,190
...my friend.

995
01:29:31,030 --> 01:29:32,670
Trench!

996
01:29:34,110 --> 01:29:35,070
Trench!

997
01:29:37,190 --> 01:29:38,150
Trench!

998
01:29:45,150 --> 01:29:46,110
Trench!

999
01:30:03,830 --> 01:30:04,990
Ibrahim!

1000
01:30:05,070 --> 01:30:06,230
Trench!

1001
01:30:06,310 --> 01:30:07,670
Don't lose our space!

1002
01:30:09,790 --> 01:30:10,630
Come on, son.

1003
01:30:10,750 --> 01:30:11,710
You mustn't fall.

1004
01:30:13,030 --> 01:30:15,070
You mustn't fall.

1005
01:30:18,910 --> 01:30:20,430
All right...

1006
01:30:26,670 --> 01:30:30,390
T-Trench.

1007
01:30:30,390 --> 01:30:32,990
Harry?

1008
01:30:42,390 --> 01:30:43,830
Harry...

1009
01:30:43,910 --> 01:30:47,190
if you didn't come with
the army, then who sent you?

1010
01:30:49,470 --> 01:30:50,830
You did.

1011
01:31:06,070 --> 01:31:10,190
All this way... for a feather.

1012
01:31:10,310 --> 01:31:12,310
I brought some money.

1013
01:31:16,430 --> 01:31:18,070
How much?

1014
01:31:18,070 --> 01:31:19,510
A hundred.

1015
01:31:23,070 --> 01:31:25,270
Hundred?

1016
01:31:34,190 --> 01:31:35,230
What's going on?

1017
01:31:35,310 --> 01:31:36,750
Who are those women?

1018
01:31:38,310 --> 01:31:40,710
They're all relatives
of the men in here.

1019
01:31:40,790 --> 01:31:42,710
They bring them scraps of food.

1020
01:31:42,710 --> 01:31:46,750
Let's see if we can get you
something to eat.

1021
01:31:48,670 --> 01:31:50,870
What can we do with this money?

1022
01:31:50,950 --> 01:31:54,030
Well, there's no chance
of bribing Idris.

1023
01:31:54,110 --> 01:31:57,950
His entire family was wiped out
by one of our artillery attacks.

1024
01:31:59,870 --> 01:32:02,550
Now, Hassan, on the other hand,
is infinitely corruptible.

1025
01:32:02,670 --> 01:32:06,990
For 100 dirhams,
he'll either help us escape...

1026
01:32:06,990 --> 01:32:10,630
or he'll stab us in the back
and keep the money.

1027
01:32:10,710 --> 01:32:12,910
I'll see if I can talk to him.

1028
01:32:13,030 --> 01:32:15,430
The first thing I do
when I get back

1029
01:32:15,510 --> 01:32:18,470
is book a table at Wilton's...
a private room.

1030
01:32:18,590 --> 01:32:20,030
No bloody crowds.

1031
01:32:20,110 --> 01:32:22,430
Two pints of stout,
please, guvner!

1032
01:32:22,510 --> 01:32:25,390
Ha! Not long now, Harry!

1033
01:32:25,470 --> 01:32:26,550
Not long now!

1034
01:32:47,430 --> 01:32:48,990
Trench.

1035
01:32:49,070 --> 01:32:50,910
Please, Trench, get up.
Trench, come on.

1036
01:36:23,030 --> 01:36:25,430
I have some money.

1037
01:36:25,430 --> 01:36:27,350
Money's no good for me.

1038
01:36:30,630 --> 01:36:34,070
I can't bribe
the guards anymore.

1039
01:36:34,070 --> 01:36:37,150
I have nothing left to lose...

1040
01:36:41,270 --> 01:36:43,190
...nothing left to live for...

1041
01:36:45,670 --> 01:36:47,790
...but still, I'm frightened.

1042
01:37:04,470 --> 01:37:07,070
Fear always remains.

1043
01:37:09,470 --> 01:37:11,390
Pray for me, Abou.

1044
01:37:13,110 --> 01:37:15,110
Take as long as you like.

1045
01:37:29,230 --> 01:37:32,270
I don't walk too proudly now.

1046
01:37:40,830 --> 01:37:42,270
Stop.

1047
01:37:53,590 --> 01:37:55,030
Have some food.

1048
01:37:58,190 --> 01:38:00,190
You're looking better.

1049
01:38:02,190 --> 01:38:03,830
You may not feel it,
but you look it.

1050
01:38:04,030 --> 01:38:07,870
When I get better,
will I look as bad as you?

1051
01:38:07,870 --> 01:38:09,590
We'll get you through this,
Trench.

1052
01:38:12,070 --> 01:38:14,270
I don't want to get
through this, Harry.

1053
01:38:16,870 --> 01:38:20,230
I don't think
I can take it anymore.

1054
01:38:25,030 --> 01:38:26,390
I had a visitor today.

1055
01:38:27,990 --> 01:38:30,110
He brought us a gift.

1056
01:38:42,590 --> 01:38:44,870
The poison will take
a few hours to work.

1057
01:38:47,270 --> 01:38:48,830
You won't feel any pain.

1058
01:38:48,910 --> 01:38:50,350
That'll make a change.

1059
01:38:56,190 --> 01:38:57,350
Careful.

1060
01:38:57,430 --> 01:38:59,470
I didn't mean
to be a pig about it.

1061
01:39:02,990 --> 01:39:06,190
How about we give them
one last night of hell?

1062
01:39:06,190 --> 01:39:08,110
I'll drink to that!

1063
01:41:45,070 --> 01:41:46,510
Oh, Trench.

1064
01:41:48,550 --> 01:41:50,830
I can't feel anything
in my legs.

1065
01:41:50,950 --> 01:41:53,030
The poison has paralyzed
your body.

1066
01:41:53,150 --> 01:41:54,390
It'll wear off soon.

1067
01:41:54,470 --> 01:41:56,790
I thought it was supposed
to kill me.

1068
01:41:56,790 --> 01:41:59,190
Only for a while.

1069
01:41:59,270 --> 01:42:02,070
You mean, you knew?

1070
01:42:02,150 --> 01:42:04,070
I couldn't be short-changed.

1071
01:42:04,190 --> 01:42:07,350
That's the last time
I let you buy the drink.

1072
01:42:28,710 --> 01:42:30,630
How many bullets?

1073
01:42:30,750 --> 01:42:31,230
One.

1074
01:42:34,190 --> 01:42:36,510
Better make it count.

1075
01:42:38,310 --> 01:42:38,990
No.

1076
01:42:39,070 --> 01:42:40,150
I can't carry him.

1077
01:42:41,950 --> 01:42:43,310
You can.

1078
01:42:44,630 --> 01:42:46,070
Save my friend.

1079
01:42:47,430 --> 01:42:48,670
Save my friend.

1080
01:47:07,630 --> 01:47:10,110
Look after your friend.

1081
01:47:10,110 --> 01:47:13,070
What will you do now?

1082
01:47:14,430 --> 01:47:16,910
Whatever God has chosen for me.

1083
01:48:07,550 --> 01:48:09,190
Do I look that bad?

1084
01:48:18,870 --> 01:48:22,030
Everyone said how...
much you'd changed.

1085
01:48:24,510 --> 01:48:27,510
I didn't believe them.

1086
01:48:39,110 --> 01:48:40,830
May I have it back?

1087
01:48:43,910 --> 01:48:45,710
That isn't why I came.

1088
01:48:45,830 --> 01:48:48,790
I'd still like it back.

1089
01:49:09,110 --> 01:49:11,790
I'm almost sorry to let it go.

1090
01:49:17,190 --> 01:49:22,350
It's brought me a lot of luck...
over these past few months.

1091
01:49:43,550 --> 01:49:45,750
Have you heard our news?

1092
01:49:45,870 --> 01:49:47,790
Yes.

1093
01:49:52,950 --> 01:49:54,470
How is Jack?

1094
01:49:57,270 --> 01:49:58,990
I think he's happy.

1095
01:49:59,070 --> 01:50:00,910
Good.

1096
01:50:05,310 --> 01:50:07,710
He deserves to be.

1097
01:50:10,790 --> 01:50:12,030
So do you.

1098
01:50:32,270 --> 01:50:33,710
It will pass.

1099
01:50:37,350 --> 01:50:39,830
You will meet someone soon.

1100
01:50:39,950 --> 01:50:43,110
Then you and her
and Jack and I...

1101
01:50:43,110 --> 01:50:44,750
Yes.

1102
01:50:44,750 --> 01:50:46,270
...will set up tea
and chat politely

1103
01:50:46,350 --> 01:50:49,710
as if... as if nothing ever
happened with us before.

1104
01:50:55,470 --> 01:50:57,990
That won't happen, Ethne.

1105
01:51:01,510 --> 01:51:03,630
It has to happen.

1106
01:51:05,750 --> 01:51:08,350
It has to because I love you...

1107
01:51:08,430 --> 01:51:10,350
Harry.

1108
01:51:13,590 --> 01:51:16,870
I love you and I can't...

1109
01:51:24,350 --> 01:51:25,790
I'm sorry.

1110
01:51:52,430 --> 01:51:55,710
Was that Ethne's carriage
outside?

1111
01:51:55,710 --> 01:51:58,310
She is giving me a ride
to the station.

1112
01:52:00,710 --> 01:52:02,030
Why didn't she come out?

1113
01:52:02,150 --> 01:52:06,350
I think she wanted to give us
a minute or two alone.

1114
01:52:06,350 --> 01:52:09,710
Do we need
a minute or two alone, Harry?

1115
01:52:14,710 --> 01:52:16,310
I came to thank you, Jack.

1116
01:52:16,430 --> 01:52:18,550
For what?

1117
01:52:18,550 --> 01:52:20,910
For standing by me.

1118
01:52:25,230 --> 01:52:26,790
If you're talking
about the feathers

1119
01:52:26,870 --> 01:52:27,830
I wasn't there.

1120
01:52:27,950 --> 01:52:29,270
Willoughby told me you were.

1121
01:52:34,750 --> 01:52:37,510
You don't owe me anything,
Harry.

1122
01:52:37,630 --> 01:52:39,630
The wedding isn't
for another month.

1123
01:52:39,710 --> 01:52:41,750
Ethne is free
to make up her own mind.

1124
01:52:41,830 --> 01:52:43,390
She's made up her mind.

1125
01:52:47,110 --> 01:52:48,750
You should trust her judgment.

1126
01:54:34,630 --> 01:54:37,390
To Castleton and all the others
we left behind.

1127
01:54:37,510 --> 01:54:38,830
Indeed.

1128
01:54:47,270 --> 01:54:49,790
You remember the first time we
led a cavalry charge in public?

1129
01:54:49,870 --> 01:54:51,230
Yes, I do, Jack.

1130
01:54:51,310 --> 01:54:52,830
You wiped the floor with me.

1131
01:54:52,950 --> 01:54:55,630
I believe most of my horses
ended up in the bandstand.

1132
01:54:55,710 --> 01:54:59,190
Yes, I did, and...
yes, they did.

1133
01:55:02,150 --> 01:55:05,870
Ethne was there... watching.

1134
01:55:05,990 --> 01:55:07,510
Yes, I remember.

1135
01:55:07,510 --> 01:55:09,030
You should.

1136
01:55:09,150 --> 01:55:10,790
You're the only one
she danced with.

1137
01:55:12,590 --> 01:55:16,710
I've never been so jealous.

1138
01:55:16,830 --> 01:55:19,510
I wanted to prove to her
that I was the better soldier.

1139
01:55:19,590 --> 01:55:21,510
Well, you always were
the better soldier, Jack.

1140
01:55:21,630 --> 01:55:22,950
Yes, of course, but...

1141
01:55:30,230 --> 01:55:34,190
She was the first person
I looked for in the crowd...

1142
01:55:34,270 --> 01:55:36,190
and she was staring at you.

1143
01:55:38,790 --> 01:55:39,830
Everyone else

1144
01:55:39,830 --> 01:55:42,310
was applauding me...

1145
01:55:42,430 --> 01:55:44,550
and she was staring at you.

1146
01:55:52,870 --> 01:55:54,310
Nothing's changed.

1147
01:56:00,070 --> 01:56:03,630
She's beautiful...

1148
01:56:03,630 --> 01:56:05,430
isn't she?

1149
01:56:09,270 --> 01:56:11,110
Yes, she is.

1150
01:56:33,350 --> 01:56:38,830
You may be lost...
but you are not forgotten.

1151
01:56:42,750 --> 01:56:45,990
For those who have journeyed far

1152
01:56:46,110 --> 01:56:50,790
to fight in foreign lands

1153
01:56:50,790 --> 01:56:55,030
know that the soldier's
greatest comfort

1154
01:56:55,110 --> 01:56:58,390
is to have his friends
close at hand.

1155
01:56:58,470 --> 01:57:00,950
Welcome home, Harry.

1156
01:57:02,790 --> 01:57:06,070
Thank you, sir.

1157
01:57:06,150 --> 01:57:09,230
In the heat of battle

1158
01:57:09,310 --> 01:57:11,430
it ceases to be an idea

1159
01:57:11,510 --> 01:57:15,270
for which we fight...

1160
01:57:15,350 --> 01:57:17,750
or a flag.

1161
01:57:17,750 --> 01:57:20,830
Rather...

1162
01:57:20,830 --> 01:57:25,790
we fight for the man
on our left

1163
01:57:25,790 --> 01:57:30,310
and we fight for the man
on our right...

1164
01:57:33,590 --> 01:57:36,630
...and when armies
have scattered

1165
01:57:36,750 --> 01:57:43,150
and when the empires
fall away...

1166
01:57:43,270 --> 01:57:52,470
all that remains is the memory
of those precious moments...

1167
01:57:56,870 --> 01:57:59,670
...we spent side by side.

1168
01:58:27,670 --> 01:58:29,670
Forgive me.

1169
01:58:29,790 --> 01:58:32,070
I did you a great wrong.

1170
01:58:32,190 --> 01:58:33,310
There is nothing to forgive.

1171
01:58:33,430 --> 01:58:34,870
Yes, there is.

1172
01:58:34,870 --> 01:58:37,550
I should've stood by you, Harry.

1173
01:58:37,630 --> 01:58:39,350
I should've understood.

1174
01:58:41,110 --> 01:58:44,270
I used to be so sure
about everything.

1175
01:58:44,350 --> 01:58:47,310
We both were, Ethne.

1176
01:58:47,310 --> 01:58:49,230
And now?

1177
01:58:59,310 --> 01:59:00,550
And now...

1178
01:59:02,470 --> 01:59:07,270
Well... well,
now I have no choice, Ethne.

1179
01:59:07,270 --> 01:59:10,070
God put you in my way.
