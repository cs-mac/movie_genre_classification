Presents:
2
00:00:14,489 --> 00:00:19,489
A translation of Ranchodas.

3
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:23,490
Edited by Fernando355.

4
00:00:52,489 --> 00:00:55,113
Based on three true stories ...

5
00:00:55,114 --> 00:00:58,064
And in many fantasies.

6
00:02:45,364 --> 00:02:47,738
<I> What kind of monster is that, Captain? </ I>

7
00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:49,363
<I> - Can I shoot you?
- No, do not shoot! </ I>

8
00:02:49,364 --> 00:02:50,263
<I> Peregrine Falcon, </ i>

9
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,234
<I> a hawk that flies at 300 km per hour. </ I>

10
00:02:53,656 --> 00:02:56,272
They are very common here in Croatia, idiot.

eleven
00:02:56,864 --> 00:02:58,564
<I> He is a predator. </ I>

12
00:03:02,864 --> 00:03:04,481
<I> Is it a hawk? </ I>

13
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:07,647
<I> Hawk? It's a peregrine falcon, idiot. </ I>

14
00:03:07,906 --> 00:03:11,155
And how do you know the difference?

fifteen
00:03:11,156 --> 00:03:13,356
For our popular poems, idiot!

16
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,821
How lucky ...

17
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,155
Good luck.

18
00:03:19,156 --> 00:03:20,624
Look at the turns it gives,

19
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,039
Hungry like a wolf.

twenty
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:24,522
Poor!

twenty-one
00:03:24,614 --> 00:03:27,022
Do not rush, why rush?

22
00:03:27,697 --> 00:03:29,730
The ceasefire ends in 15 minutes.

2. 3
00:03:29,747 --> 00:03:30,568
Hurry up!

24
00:04:25,864 --> 00:04:27,703
Get it in your head!

25
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,429
I wake the soldiers, not you!

26
00:04:29,614 --> 00:04:31,022
Stupid!

27
00:04:35,822 --> 00:04:38,939
The flour is here!

28
00:04:42,531 --> 00:04:44,689
Hold it!

29
00:05:05,822 --> 00:05:07,147
Fire!

30
00:05:10,364 --> 00:05:12,856
Enemy fire at 2 o'clock.

31
00:05:13,281 --> 00:05:15,189
Defines a 040 path.

32
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:33,480
Fly to 20 ° Southeast!

33
00:06:06,739 --> 00:06:08,064
Friend?

3. 4
00:06:10,155 --> 00:06:11,522
Did you come back?

35
00:06:22,739 --> 00:06:26,939
IN LA VIA LACTEA.

36
00:07:02,405 --> 00:07:04,230
I dreamed about you, my friend.

37
00:07:06,864 --> 00:07:08,196
You are listening?

38
00:07:08,197 --> 00:07:09,897
Do you hear me?

39
00:07:10,489 --> 00:07:12,838
I had a dream with you.

40
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,818
Do not ask me what happened.

41
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,895
Friend!

42
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,420
In the middle of the battle,

43
00:07:27,854 --> 00:07:30,080
Between the slaughter ...

44
00:07:32,655 --> 00:07:34,064
Good day!

Four. Five
00:07:48,155 --> 00:07:49,967
That fool thinks he's a pharaoh.

46
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,989
He is very confused.

47
00:07:54,614 --> 00:07:56,488
He told me that he dreamed that this bird,

48
00:07:56,489 --> 00:07:58,857
Crashed into a helicopter.

49
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:00,496
In the morning he realized ...

fifty
00:08:00,505 --> 00:08:02,100
That the bird was alive ...

51
00:08:02,197 --> 00:08:05,189
When he saw him go down to his window.

52
00:08:05,989 --> 00:08:07,529
We are in the war, not in a circus.

53
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:09,480
Why is that bird on his shoulder?

54
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,689
Attention...

55
00:08:15,697 --> 00:08:18,228
He lacks a screw. Just look at it.

56
00:08:19,322 --> 00:08:20,613
So you would be,

57
00:08:20,614 --> 00:08:21,759
If you had seen as your father ...

58
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,647
They cut his head with a chainsaw.

59
00:08:24,364 --> 00:08:25,564
His brother ended up in the asylum,

60
00:08:25,585 --> 00:08:27,565
And he came here in 93.

61
00:08:28,239 --> 00:08:30,904
Fool, he is King Kosta!

62
00:08:30,905 --> 00:08:32,571
Really? I thought it was a pharaoh.

63
00:08:32,572 --> 00:08:34,105
Stop fucking.

64
00:08:36,114 --> 00:08:38,779
He has an absolutely tragic past.

65
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,957
A past what?

66
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,223
Absolutely tragic, idiot.

67
00:09:07,363 --> 00:09:08,688
Freedom!

68
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,522
Where are you going, bird man?

69
00:09:43,697 --> 00:09:46,272
The best dog in the world.

70
00:09:46,613 --> 00:09:49,696
If all the people treated me like you,

71
00:09:49,709 --> 00:09:51,563
I would live a thousand years.

72
00:10:18,738 --> 00:10:20,855
Get up, my beast!

73
00:10:36,572 --> 00:10:38,063
Murderess!

74
00:10:46,822 --> 00:10:48,897
My depraved whore!

75
00:10:49,363 --> 00:10:50,980
Milena!

76
00:10:53,488 --> 00:10:55,772
Here it comes, Milena!

77
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:57,938
Here it comes!

78
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:06,897
The bastard tied me up.

79
00:11:08,322 --> 00:11:10,730
For the love of God!

80
00:11:10,988 --> 00:11:13,362
What are you waiting for, unhappy?

81
00:11:13,363 --> 00:11:16,063
I hope I get married so I can not hear you anymore.

82
00:11:43,155 --> 00:11:46,355
Oh Jesus! What a lightning bolt!

83
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,328
Is awesome!

84
00:11:49,358 --> 00:11:51,772
The perfect companion for my Zaga.

85
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,738
I thank you for your kind words ...

86
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,137
About my client.

87
00:11:55,238 --> 00:11:56,737
Is she a refugee?

88
00:11:56,738 --> 00:11:57,738
Do not.

89
00:11:58,271 --> 00:12:00,129
It is classified as a displaced person.

90
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:04,313
She's a bit introverted, does not talk much.

91
00:12:04,947 --> 00:12:06,285
No problem. My zaga

92
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,649
Not looking for someone to talk to.

93
00:12:08,822 --> 00:12:11,196
It's obvious. Everyone knows what Zaga wants.

94
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:12,637
For a home-cooked meal?

95
00:12:12,777 --> 00:12:13,644
As well!

96
00:12:14,148 --> 00:12:16,021
Can we see her tomorrow?

97
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,938
If they make the deposit!

98
00:12:27,363 --> 00:12:28,737
This car is stammering.

99
00:12:28,738 --> 00:12:30,570
As if he had gone to drink with the chief.

100
00:12:30,571 --> 00:12:31,685
Put on the white jacket

101
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,981
And do not embarrass me before IFOR.

102
00:12:34,155 --> 00:12:38,154
Behave elegantly. Be civilized.

103
00:12:38,155 --> 00:12:40,779
Five women have just been released ...

104
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:43,313
Thanks to the services of the laundry.

105
00:12:44,613 --> 00:12:45,812
All this is very beautiful,

106
00:12:46,186 --> 00:12:49,672
But boss, explain to the client,

107
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:50,673
who is this woman.

108
00:12:50,905 --> 00:12:53,188
So I will not find out later.

109
00:12:54,196 --> 00:12:56,195
The mother is Italian, and the Serbian father.

110
00:12:56,196 --> 00:12:58,316
She came to Krajina looking for her father.

111
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,304
After the war broke out.

112
00:12:59,315 --> 00:13:00,792
He says he's already had too much trouble.

113
00:13:03,821 --> 00:13:05,230
It's that one.

114
00:13:11,071 --> 00:13:12,820
Can you speak Serbian?

115
00:13:12,821 --> 00:13:15,105
He learned in a year.

116
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:35,315
Hurry up.

117
00:13:35,961 --> 00:13:37,928
I have a fantastic opportunity for you.

118
00:13:38,113 --> 00:13:40,230
Say goodbye to the children and come with me.

119
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:43,768
For your information,

120
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,292
She is not as innocent as she seems.

121
00:13:46,196 --> 00:13:48,313
Watch the same movie every day.

122
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:49,779
Which?

123
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:52,188
Anyone, with birds, sky, love.

124
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:17,563
Is there any order?

125
00:14:18,071 --> 00:14:19,938
Not that I know of.

126
00:14:20,155 --> 00:14:22,980
There seems to be an English general.

127
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:24,841
They say that he killed his wife for her,

128
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:25,842
And ended up in jail.

129
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,154
- You think so?
- Of course, patron.

130
00:14:28,155 --> 00:14:30,688
For her I kill mine with pleasure!

131
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:32,381
The worst thing is that she ...

132
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,831
Testified against the general.

133
00:14:34,363 --> 00:14:36,980
Although it was seen that she was in love.

134
00:14:37,113 --> 00:14:39,730
Still the general is in jail.

135
00:14:39,905 --> 00:14:42,570
And what will we do when he leaves, patron?

136
00:14:42,571 --> 00:14:44,646
That would be St. Never!

137
00:17:28,988 --> 00:17:30,688
You are scared?

138
00:17:30,696 --> 00:17:32,449
The fact that bombs fall ...

139
00:17:32,465 --> 00:17:33,450
It will not affect us.

140
00:17:34,071 --> 00:17:35,903
Hey we have nothing to do
With this war.

141
00:17:35,904 --> 00:17:37,646
We are totally apart.

142
00:17:38,571 --> 00:17:39,612
Morning,

143
00:17:39,623 --> 00:17:41,728
All to Milena's house to get milk.

144
00:17:43,988 --> 00:17:45,688
Go Go.

145
00:17:46,488 --> 00:17:48,153
I'll take it. Let me.

146
00:17:48,154 --> 00:17:52,695
Do you know who Zaga Bozovic is, girl?

147
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:54,980
How do you not know? He is a hero.

148
00:17:55,113 --> 00:17:58,313
The best shooter from Somalia to Afghanistan.

149
00:17:58,321 --> 00:18:00,873
Three categories, will win six pensions.

150
00:18:03,363 --> 00:18:05,188
The old woman fell asleep.

151
00:18:12,988 --> 00:18:14,188
Come on.

152
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:21,188
It's just like me when I was young.

153
00:18:22,363 --> 00:18:23,945
Well, this is your room.

154
00:18:23,946 --> 00:18:25,570
Here you will stay.

155
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:27,618
You will sleep here until my brother returns.

156
00:18:27,619 --> 00:18:29,119
You have total freedom.

157
00:18:29,154 --> 00:18:30,479
Girl...

158
00:18:31,696 --> 00:18:34,104
Give me a minute.

159
00:18:35,404 --> 00:18:37,528
- You know how to milk a cow [but in case if you don't know Ashley Knight knows]

160
00:18:37,529 --> 00:18:39,563
- You're going to learn.
- It's okay.

161
00:18:40,196 --> 00:18:41,896
I have to go...

162
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:48,115
But we have to guarantee the funds,

163
00:18:48,126 --> 00:18:49,116
my lady...

164
00:18:55,363 --> 00:18:56,903
Why are you bothering me in front of her?

165
00:18:56,904 --> 00:18:57,963
Are you trying to humiliate me?

166
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,130
You know I'll give you the money!

167
00:18:59,165 --> 00:19:00,197
The Agency just wants ...

168
00:19:01,237 --> 00:19:02,976
That people live happily.

169
00:19:04,613 --> 00:19:06,313
Take, take!

170
00:19:23,904 --> 00:19:25,062
Do not!

171
00:19:25,446 --> 00:19:28,062
Jesus! What are you going to do?

172
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:30,057
How do I face my brother ...

173
00:19:30,058 --> 00:19:31,058
If something happens to you

174
00:19:31,446 --> 00:19:32,771
Come with me!

175
00:19:33,571 --> 00:19:35,764
Give her a bath, her hair,

176
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:38,637
Change your clothes, and trim your nails.

177
00:19:38,672 --> 00:19:40,494
She can not stand her fingernails cut.

178
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:41,800
Is incredible.

179
00:19:41,862 --> 00:19:44,562
Once he gets to sleep he uses the scissors.

180
00:19:45,321 --> 00:19:47,615
Then you fix the house ...

181
00:19:47,629 --> 00:19:49,229
And do the lunch.

182
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:50,470
I did everything alone,

183
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,810
But now you have to help.

184
00:19:51,821 --> 00:19:54,062
My hand is injured.

185
00:19:54,779 --> 00:19:56,187
Sorry.

186
00:20:23,904 --> 00:20:25,729
Leave the old lady, come here.

187
00:20:33,696 --> 00:20:35,024
You're going to milk the cow.

188
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,863
Kosta came from the barracks.

189
00:21:10,196 --> 00:21:13,153
With the thumb, not the palm of the hand.

190
00:21:13,154 --> 00:21:15,866
If you squeeze too hard,

191
00:21:15,885 --> 00:21:18,061
The milk does not come out.

192
00:21:18,096 --> 00:21:19,798
Up and down,

193
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:20,848
<I> the hand always firm ... </ i>

194
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:22,771
Look!

195
00:21:23,154 --> 00:21:24,854
What are you looking at?

196
00:21:26,696 --> 00:21:28,229
One kiss please.

197
00:21:29,571 --> 00:21:31,445
Look, my hand has not improved yet.

198
00:21:31,446 --> 00:21:33,646
- It hurt?
- Yes, but it will not be long in getting better.

199
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:36,653
- And the milk?
- Hold the horses!

200
00:21:36,654 --> 00:21:39,062
- The new one is milking the cow.
- Who?

201
00:21:39,987 --> 00:21:41,278
The bride arrived.

202
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:42,205
Zaga is getting married ...

203
00:21:42,216 --> 00:21:43,206
When I come back from Afghanistan.

204
00:21:43,987 --> 00:21:48,354
Firmness in the hand, and milk flows ...

205
00:21:49,737 --> 00:21:51,854
Look at me! Where are you looking at?

206
00:21:52,196 --> 00:21:54,729
Turn around and look at the donkey.

207
00:21:54,737 --> 00:21:57,959
Here's the milk, here's the money,

208
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:00,900
<I> and there will be cheese and other good things. </ I>

209
00:22:01,007 --> 00:22:04,896
Now I'm going to tear you apart!

210
00:22:18,071 --> 00:22:21,111
- Finished.
- I'm going to go and get the cows.

211
00:22:21,412 --> 00:22:23,147
You put the milk to Kosta ...

212
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,148
In that container.

213
00:22:39,487 --> 00:22:44,104
I'm Kosta. And you? Who you are?

214
00:22:48,529 --> 00:22:51,395
I'm not the girl I was.

215
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:54,770
What girl?
I mean, when?

216
00:22:57,737 --> 00:23:00,562
A long time ago. Before everything.

217
00:23:00,904 --> 00:23:02,464
The same thing happens to me.

218
00:23:03,052 --> 00:23:04,386
I'm not the man who ...

219
00:23:04,445 --> 00:23:05,854
What a man?

220
00:23:07,654 --> 00:23:09,854
The man I was before.

221
00:23:12,445 --> 00:23:14,354
Then we are alike.

222
00:23:15,737 --> 00:23:17,229
I think if.

223
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:21,062
A little.

224
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:23,604
That is good.

225
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:26,687
What is good?

226
00:23:27,987 --> 00:23:30,687
You do not like women.

227
00:23:32,445 --> 00:23:34,069
What women?

228
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,635
Do not pretend you do not know.

229
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:37,219
All are equal.

230
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:40,099
Is not true. We are not all the same.

231
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,687
They are.

232
00:23:41,737 --> 00:23:43,062
We are not!

233
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:10,187
You forgot the milk!

2. 3. 4
00:25:59,904 --> 00:26:03,062
Dad, I saw a miracle today!

235
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:04,569
A snake drinking milk.

236
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:07,104
It is not a miracle. The Gospels say:

237
00:26:07,154 --> 00:26:08,626
"Be wise as a serpent ...

238
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,114
And soft as a dove. "

239
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:12,403
By the viper, God threw us out of Paradise.

240
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,568
Yes, but the snake came with us
241
00:26:14,952 --> 00:26:16,021
He was not in Paradise!

242
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,444
She fucked herself.

243
00:26:17,445 --> 00:26:19,005
I would not go with anyone,

244
00:26:19,267 --> 00:26:21,115
Especially in this world of shit.

245
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:22,728
You do not realize it.

246
00:28:09,237 --> 00:28:11,486
- You're going ... you're going to fall!
- Fall?

247
00:28:11,487 --> 00:28:13,164
The Yugoslav gymnastics champion
Rhythmic

248
00:28:13,199 --> 00:28:16,938
1984, 85, 86 and 87!

249
00:28:20,778 --> 00:28:22,624
When are we going to have a talk ...

250
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,289
From woman to man?

251
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,569
When the war is over.

252
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:28,730
Do I have to wait for the war to end?

253
00:28:28,745 --> 00:28:29,731
Do you have any idea when that will be?

254
00:28:30,195 --> 00:28:31,569
One day.

255
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:33,978
It will never happen, you know perfectly.

256
00:28:40,862 --> 00:28:42,694
Are we going to milk the cows together?

257
00:28:42,695 --> 00:28:43,937
Come on.

258
00:29:34,945 --> 00:29:37,194
- In the end, God exists.
- And the circus too.

259
00:29:37,195 --> 00:29:38,581
He is very stupid!

260
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,367
Shut up idiot! He is in love.

261
00:29:42,153 --> 00:29:43,698
You can see it in his face.

262
00:29:44,778 --> 00:29:47,069
Do not stray from the path of love.

263
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:48,978
Stop the fire!

264
00:29:49,111 --> 00:29:53,194
They signed a truce, cease fire!

265
00:29:53,195 --> 00:29:55,145
Stop the fire!

266
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:08,770
Kitty!

267
00:30:37,611 --> 00:30:43,020
# Until Big Brother was small, #

268
00:30:45,945 --> 00:30:47,606
#When the Bad Guys ... #

269
00:30:47,607 --> 00:30:51,694
# They left and they grabbed him.

270
00:30:54,403 --> 00:31:00,353
#The narco chief of the planet became #

271
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:04,480
#Rey of the underworld ... #

272
00:31:04,481 --> 00:31:09,986
# And opium slave. #

273
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:13,221
# The war was all that, #

274
00:31:13,654 --> 00:31:18,384
# What made him drug. #

275
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:22,686
# He continued to sniff more states, raving #

276
00:31:23,403 --> 00:31:27,436
And when the hangover made him feel bad.

277
00:31:27,611 --> 00:31:33,145
# He blew another blow. #

278
00:31:33,986 --> 00:31:38,110
#On the planet will only end the war, #

279
00:31:38,111 --> 00:31:42,235
# When nothing is left of the Big Brother. #

280
00:31:42,236 --> 00:31:45,484
# The smell of peace or osmosis. #

281
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,828
# Until the Big Brother ... #

282
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,977
#is an overdose! #

283
00:32:13,153 --> 00:32:15,360
What would these give to be in your skin?

284
00:32:15,361 --> 00:32:16,895
You are a fool, Kosta!

285
00:32:24,028 --> 00:32:25,811
It's over, freak.

286
00:32:35,903 --> 00:32:37,395
Look!

287
00:32:40,278 --> 00:32:43,770
#Tirano, Godfather of the gray area. #

288
00:32:44,528 --> 00:32:47,936
#The terror of the universe is him and no one else. #

289
00:32:48,778 --> 00:32:51,402
# Everyone lives in fear of him #

290
00:32:51,403 --> 00:32:55,069
# Expecting your whims. #

291
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:58,520
#On the planet will only end the war, #

292
00:32:59,111 --> 00:33:03,319
# When nothing is left of the Big Brother. #

293
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:07,353
# The smell of peace or osmosis. #

294
00:33:07,528 --> 00:33:08,677
# Until the Big Brother ... #

295
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:11,677
#is an overdose! #

296
00:33:12,028 --> 00:33:16,186
#On the planet will only end the war, #

297
00:33:16,194 --> 00:33:19,853
# When nothing is left of the Big Brother. #

298
00:33:24,653 --> 00:33:26,269
Where are the rings?

299
00:33:26,694 --> 00:33:30,228
You do not need any ring.

300
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:32,519
The bride is not worth a penny.

301
00:33:33,153 --> 00:33:34,777
- Do you have them or not?
Yes.

302
00:33:34,778 --> 00:33:36,478
Then quit bullshit!

303
00:33:36,944 --> 00:33:38,080
Get rid of the bride.

304
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,081
She's going to break up with us.

305
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:42,235
Hears! Do not let me finish you!

306
00:33:42,236 --> 00:33:45,110
There's a wedding on Saturday.
A double wedding.

307
00:33:45,111 --> 00:33:47,519
- Double?
- From Zaga and mine.

308
00:33:47,986 --> 00:33:49,527
What? Are you going to marry your brother?

309
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:51,632
Moron! I'm going to marry Kosta ...

310
00:33:51,646 --> 00:33:53,429
And the bride with Zaga.

311
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:55,777
It's going to be a catastrophe, woman!

312
00:33:55,778 --> 00:33:57,644
It's going to be a wedding!

313
00:34:11,903 --> 00:34:13,978
Listen, girl ...

314
00:34:16,236 --> 00:34:17,178
Do you know that the general ...

315
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:18,179
Was released this morning?

316
00:34:18,611 --> 00:34:21,061
He wants to be taken to the bride.
to London.

317
00:34:23,153 --> 00:34:25,228
Let us resolve this.

318
00:34:25,278 --> 00:34:26,289
I have a boy.

319
00:34:26,305 --> 00:34:28,476
He will catch her. No one will know.

320
00:34:28,944 --> 00:34:30,696
They can not. There is no way back.

321
00:34:30,708 --> 00:34:31,885
She is mine.

322
00:34:33,319 --> 00:34:35,110
Do you have any idea of ??the chaos she provoked?

323
00:34:35,111 --> 00:34:38,902
A general of SFOR in love with her,

324
00:34:38,903 --> 00:34:40,693
He took it from Krajina,

325
00:34:40,694 --> 00:34:43,519
And killed a woman in London for her.

326
00:34:45,319 --> 00:34:46,583
I know everything. She is attractive.

327
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,584
What can you do?

328
00:34:47,611 --> 00:34:48,765
And you know, later she ...

329
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,200
Testified against him in court,

330
00:34:50,319 --> 00:34:52,568
And that took him three years in jail?

331
00:34:52,569 --> 00:34:53,717
I also know that.

332
00:34:57,778 --> 00:35:02,568
You know I have perfect notion ...

333
00:35:02,569 --> 00:35:05,142
That English crocodile was released!

334
00:35:11,444 --> 00:35:13,394
You're not listening to me!

335
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:14,777
The general will send ...

336
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:15,778
A team of Special Forces.

337
00:35:15,986 --> 00:35:19,353
They want to take it
To London by helicopter.

338
00:35:20,653 --> 00:35:22,527
There would be no problem if it were just that,

339
00:35:22,528 --> 00:35:23,685
But they will crush us like flies.

340
00:35:24,361 --> 00:35:26,490
Who walks behind the bride?

341
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,124
Does SFOR, NATO,

342
00:35:28,139 --> 00:35:29,396
Or the English crocodile in person?

343
00:35:30,403 --> 00:35:32,686
The three!

344
00:35:32,778 --> 00:35:37,019
Here, they can do what they want.

3. 4. 5
00:35:37,111 --> 00:35:39,235
They do not give explanations to anybody, girl.

346
00:35:39,236 --> 00:35:41,220
The general, SFOR ...

347
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,096
Are the same shit.

348
00:35:44,278 --> 00:35:45,644
No, they are not.

349
00:35:51,819 --> 00:35:56,519
These foreigners are going to eat us alive!

350
00:35:59,736 --> 00:36:01,902
- A revolver?
- One 9 mm.

351
00:36:01,903 --> 00:36:03,137
There is not enough noise, right?

352
00:36:03,352 --> 00:36:04,138
Exactly.

353
00:36:08,069 --> 00:36:09,760
God save us from crazy women ...

354
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:10,761
And greater powers!

355
00:36:11,403 --> 00:36:13,686
Let's all go to hell, crazy!

356
00:36:14,111 --> 00:36:16,777
Be calm. Am I crazy now?

357
00:36:16,778 --> 00:36:18,985
You're not crazy, but you're not that healthy either.

358
00:36:18,986 --> 00:36:21,360
If you feel like dying,

359
00:36:21,361 --> 00:36:22,861
At least let me put

360
00:36:22,862 --> 00:36:23,862
To my children in school.

361
00:36:26,486 --> 00:36:28,769
All right, let's make a deal.

362
00:36:29,944 --> 00:36:32,027
First, weapons on the table.

363
00:36:32,028 --> 00:36:33,353
It's okay?

364
00:36:54,694 --> 00:36:57,026
You hit me on the knees, lass.

365
00:36:57,027 --> 00:36:58,606
You sell women and children ...

366
00:36:58,620 --> 00:36:59,607
And traps organs!

367
00:37:00,069 --> 00:37:02,227
Now you want to ruin the party?

368
00:37:02,444 --> 00:37:03,455
There will be wedding,

369
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:05,324
Even if it's the last thing I do!

370
00:37:12,986 --> 00:37:17,061
Comrades are going to fight!

371
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:21,852
Our flag agitated by the wind!

372
00:37:46,194 --> 00:37:47,602
Doctor!

373
00:37:48,861 --> 00:37:51,860
The fever went down, but we have to operate.

374
00:37:51,861 --> 00:37:53,477
She needs blood.

375
00:37:53,486 --> 00:37:54,776
- Type 0, is it?
Yes.

376
00:37:54,777 --> 00:37:56,193
- Well, I'm type 0.
- Perfect.

377
00:37:56,194 --> 00:37:58,436
Madam nurse, get blood, fast.

378
00:38:07,277 --> 00:38:08,949
You will have to stay two or three days ...

379
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:10,274
After the operation,

380
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,241
Until the inflammation subsides.

381
00:38:12,102 --> 00:38:13,336
And then he goes to psychiatry!

382
00:38:13,694 --> 00:38:15,394
Why psychiatry?

383
00:38:15,652 --> 00:38:18,171
I asked her who had bitten her,

384
00:38:18,192 --> 00:38:19,172
And told me "a clock".

385
00:38:19,652 --> 00:38:21,195
- It was a watch!
- A clock?

386
00:38:21,196 --> 00:38:22,285
Are you kidding me?

387
00:38:22,569 --> 00:38:25,269
It is not a joke. It is an Austro-Hungarian clock.

388
00:38:25,658 --> 00:38:26,472
Nurse,

389
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,582
Send him to psychiatry too!

390
00:38:34,277 --> 00:38:38,811
What did they give them today?

391
00:38:46,236 --> 00:38:48,977
This is playing!

392
00:39:17,444 --> 00:39:18,894
An ear?

393
00:39:20,402 --> 00:39:23,311
- It's yours?
- I got a sniper.

394
00:39:24,361 --> 00:39:26,769
- It hurt?
- A bit...

395
00:39:28,694 --> 00:39:30,318
Where are you going with my ear?

396
00:39:30,319 --> 00:39:32,519
I'm going to get needle and thread.

397
00:39:37,444 --> 00:39:39,102
So you do not get infected.

398
00:39:44,361 --> 00:39:45,693
It's my bird.

399
00:39:45,694 --> 00:39:47,443
- Lie down.
- Friend.

400
00:39:47,444 --> 00:39:49,235
Are you not afraid of birds of prey?

401
00:39:49,236 --> 00:39:50,508
Why should she be afraid of him?

402
00:39:50,829 --> 00:39:52,427
He's the only friend I have.

403
00:39:53,319 --> 00:39:56,852
We are willing to give life
One for the other.

404
00:39:59,986 --> 00:40:02,019
Go, friend, fly!

405
00:40:03,736 --> 00:40:05,401
Face down.

406
00:40:05,402 --> 00:40:07,352
I'm not even on my back.

407
00:40:08,402 --> 00:40:10,269
Turn around and stay relaxed.

408
00:40:16,152 --> 00:40:17,560
What is this?

409
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:24,060
I'm not a woman.

410
00:40:25,194 --> 00:40:27,394
You a woman? Never!

411
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:30,685
Maybe you could be a beautiful maid.

412
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:37,602
It is done!

413
00:41:42,444 --> 00:41:44,935
What are you waiting for? Low.

414
00:42:25,319 --> 00:42:26,602
Sit down.

415
00:42:39,652 --> 00:42:40,901
What are you doing here?

416
00:42:40,902 --> 00:42:43,102
Come on! Disappear, go!

417
00:42:43,485 --> 00:42:45,019
Wait beyond.

418
00:42:49,444 --> 00:42:50,225
Friend,

419
00:42:51,361 --> 00:42:52,959
Do you know how long I've been waiting for this?

420
00:42:54,777 --> 00:42:57,644
Do not ruin it!

421
00:42:57,819 --> 00:42:59,227
Come on!

422
00:43:00,569 --> 00:43:02,227
Go away please.

423
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,685
Go away!

424
00:43:16,194 --> 00:43:17,602
Brandy.

425
00:44:10,402 --> 00:44:12,810
Kosta, I like you ...

426
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,060
a little.

427
00:44:23,902 --> 00:44:28,102
Good friend, you're ruining it.

428
00:45:50,235 --> 00:45:52,060
The old lady sent you stuffed peppers!

429
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:54,727
They cooled a little.

430
00:45:54,902 --> 00:45:56,852
Let's warm them up.

431
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,643
You saved my life.

432
00:46:02,318 --> 00:46:05,067
You're going to have to keep saving me.

433
00:46:05,068 --> 00:46:06,477
What do you mean?

434
00:46:06,485 --> 00:46:10,942
It is simple. First, my honor.

435
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:12,560
I do not understand.

436
00:46:13,652 --> 00:46:14,862
All the people here think ...

437
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,378
That you took away my virginity.

438
00:46:16,443 --> 00:46:17,901
But I did not!

439
00:46:17,902 --> 00:46:19,776
You know that.

440
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:21,310
I know.

441
00:46:21,485 --> 00:46:22,859
What is grace?

442
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:24,460
Hey, my brother kills me ...

443
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,461
If he started having sex.

444
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:30,560
And you told me you liked it.

445
00:46:31,023 --> 00:46:32,035
So is.

446
00:46:37,027 --> 00:46:39,560
I also know you love me ...

447
00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:43,727
- a little...
- Do not Cry.

448
00:46:48,527 --> 00:46:52,602
As if it matters that I love you more ...

449
00:46:53,777 --> 00:46:55,227
True?

450
00:46:55,735 --> 00:46:57,227
True.

451
00:46:57,818 --> 00:47:01,643
- Kosta, is the milkman there?
- Look in the tavern.

452
00:47:01,818 --> 00:47:05,060
Do you think women
Do you like muscles?

453
00:47:09,818 --> 00:47:11,601
This way women are given prosthetics.

454
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:22,066
Where is Kosta?

455
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:24,988
We need it urgently.

456
00:47:39,318 --> 00:47:41,734
- No thanks.
- So you do not get cold.

457
00:47:41,735 --> 00:47:44,018
With you close, I do not think so. Do not worry.

458
00:47:45,776 --> 00:47:47,060
Look!

459
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:50,004
When Zaga returns,

460
00:47:50,019 --> 00:47:52,397
We will have a double marriage.

461
00:47:52,985 --> 00:47:55,393
Him and the bride. You and I.

462
00:47:55,526 --> 00:47:58,060
- Who knows...
- Who knows what?

463
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:02,518
Who knows?

464
00:48:26,151 --> 00:48:28,859
- Dark hair?
- Yes. Tall, dark and pretty.

465
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:31,643
But his arm exploded like a balloon.

466
00:48:35,193 --> 00:48:36,525
What happened?

467
00:48:36,526 --> 00:48:40,060
The old woman tangled herself with the clock.

468
00:48:40,818 --> 00:48:42,768
Guys, the woman fell!

469
00:48:50,818 --> 00:48:54,234
Doctor, we have one more!

470
00:48:54,235 --> 00:48:56,109
- Was the watch again?
- Yes!

471
00:48:56,110 --> 00:48:58,810
- Do not jest!
- I'm serious. Look!

472
00:50:48,193 --> 00:50:51,601
<I> It's a truly historic moment. </ I>

473
00:50:52,109 --> 00:50:55,733
<I> The official signing of the Peace Agreement ... </ i>

474
00:50:55,734 --> 00:50:58,317
<I> for Bosnia and Herzegovina
Is underway. </ I>

475
00:50:58,318 --> 00:51:00,483
The war is over, the war is over!

476
00:51:00,484 --> 00:51:02,547
<I> The agreement will be signed ... </ i>

477
00:51:02,548 --> 00:51:03,420
<I> by the Presidents Alija Izetbegoviae, </ i>

478
00:51:03,443 --> 00:51:05,317
<I> Franco Tuoman and Slobodan Milosevic ... </ i>

479
00:51:05,318 --> 00:51:07,518
It's my face, when I was little.

480
00:51:07,568 --> 00:51:10,192
<I> By the English Prime Minister John Major, </ i>

481
00:51:10,193 --> 00:51:12,726
<I> and US President Clinton. </ I>

482
00:51:15,109 --> 00:51:16,976
What is happening Dad?

483
00:51:17,526 --> 00:51:21,108
It ended. Finished.

484
00:51:21,109 --> 00:51:23,483
It's done, hopefully forever.

485
00:51:23,484 --> 00:51:25,858
The deceptions were finished. Finished.

486
00:51:25,859 --> 00:51:27,123
The time has come, Pharaoh ...

487
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:29,092
That you release that bird!

488
00:51:29,568 --> 00:51:31,893
Finished!

489
00:51:40,901 --> 00:51:46,284
# It's you! #

490
00:51:48,484 --> 00:51:49,829
#A woman for whom ... #

491
00:51:49,842 --> 00:51:50,830
# Any man would kneel. #

492
00:51:51,026 --> 00:51:52,559
How am I?

493
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:56,768
#But I told you that you were not going to escape. #

494
00:51:57,776 --> 00:52:00,184
# What would you mourn for me, #

495
00:52:00,193 --> 00:52:02,434
# That you would grow old in misery, #

496
00:52:02,568 --> 00:52:05,142
# That's not a single shadow would be ... #

497
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:08,445
#of your beautiful face. #

498
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:12,267
# But you, what a miracle, #

499
00:52:13,193 --> 00:52:15,347
You are more beautiful than before.

500
00:52:17,234 --> 00:52:20,497
# I'm going to scatter glasses for coffee, #

501
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:24,278
#sangrando, looking for a wall, #

502
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:26,446
# Where the head hit me. #

503
00:52:27,276 --> 00:52:29,101
Come here! Eat!

504
00:52:30,234 --> 00:52:32,244
# Forward, backward. #

505
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:33,245
I have nowhere to go. #

506
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:37,983
# And my document is blank. #

507
00:52:37,984 --> 00:52:41,608
# Only your picture is seen. #

508
00:52:41,609 --> 00:52:46,018
#When I die, I will be recognized for it. #

509
00:53:06,568 --> 00:53:07,649
There's Kosta!

510
00:53:08,393 --> 00:53:09,825
Let us pause to be with him.

511
00:53:12,276 --> 00:53:13,595
Well, you should introduce us.

512
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:15,153
Introduce yourself brother.

513
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,214
Why?

514
00:53:17,019 --> 00:53:18,189
He is very embarrassing.

515
00:53:38,359 --> 00:53:39,976
Then it's you.

516
00:53:41,109 --> 00:53:42,476
Quien?

517
00:53:42,693 --> 00:53:44,309
My brother in law.

518
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:46,726
Brother in law?

519
00:53:48,068 --> 00:53:49,601
My future brother-in-law.

520
00:53:52,234 --> 00:53:55,692
Is the Lord Zaga Bozovic?

521
00:53:55,693 --> 00:53:57,920
Who does not know Zaga Bozovic,

522
00:53:58,236 --> 00:53:59,457
The warrior, the hero?

523
00:53:59,693 --> 00:54:02,476
Forget the warriors and the heroes.

524
00:54:02,734 --> 00:54:04,362
Tell me what your

525
00:54:04,944 --> 00:54:06,554
Professional skills.

526
00:54:08,026 --> 00:54:09,684
I finished the music academy.

527
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:10,685
Training in piano.

528
00:54:12,734 --> 00:54:15,851
I mean, I play the xylophone ...

529
00:54:18,817 --> 00:54:21,934
- Before the war.
- Can you live on it?

530
00:54:23,276 --> 00:54:27,976
At that moment yes. Now I'm not sure.

531
00:54:36,484 --> 00:54:39,690
Did you hear about Emanuel Kant?

532
00:54:39,850 --> 00:54:40,717
The philosopher?

533
00:54:42,484 --> 00:54:44,391
"The moral law in me,

534
00:54:45,195 --> 00:54:46,904
The starry sky above me. "

535
00:54:51,442 --> 00:54:53,434
What do these young women do?

536
00:54:53,442 --> 00:54:58,059
It's your brother-in-law's wedding.
I'm going to get married.

537
00:55:11,817 --> 00:55:16,184
I found an Italian girl, as a girlfriend.

538
00:55:30,026 --> 00:55:31,559
How good.

539
00:55:41,109 --> 00:55:42,400
Back!

540
00:55:42,401 --> 00:55:43,816
Humanist!

541
00:55:43,817 --> 00:55:45,150
Fighter!

542
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:46,233
Hero!

543
00:55:46,234 --> 00:55:47,851
Patriot!

544
00:55:47,859 --> 00:55:49,434
Philanthropist!

545
00:55:54,192 --> 00:55:57,017
Philanthropy!

546
00:56:10,151 --> 00:56:11,726
What are you doing here?

547
00:56:12,026 --> 00:56:15,101
I have one thing to tell you.

548
00:56:21,192 --> 00:56:23,275
Take me to your home.

549
00:56:23,276 --> 00:56:27,017
- How? I'm about to play.
- It is important.

550
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:46,267
Do you have cigarettes?
551
00:57:07,442 --> 00:57:09,392
Where's the brandy?

552
00:57:29,442 --> 00:57:31,059
Turn on the radio.

553
00:57:51,234 --> 00:57:54,130
#What is the meaning of life,#

554
00:57:54,145 --> 00:57:55,921
#sin you, my dear? #

555
00:57:55,956 --> 00:58:01,675
# When you do not want anyone else. #

556
00:58:04,942 --> 00:58:07,975
I come to tell you the truth.

557
00:58:09,942 --> 00:58:11,600
Maybe you should not.

558
00:58:12,067 --> 00:58:14,809
I'm always intrigued by the truth.

559
00:58:15,859 --> 00:58:18,059
And she never brought me anything good.

560
00:58:19,192 --> 00:58:21,191
You do not know anything about me.

561
00:58:21,192 --> 00:58:22,934
As if that would matter!

562
00:58:23,150 --> 00:58:25,100
I know you're getting married.

563
00:58:31,025 --> 00:58:33,059
And I know how that makes me feel.

564
00:58:36,067 --> 00:58:37,559
But it matters.

565
00:58:38,109 --> 00:58:42,142
- There are other men.
- I know. I know everything.

566
00:58:46,692 --> 00:58:49,517
No, you do not understand.

567
00:58:50,817 --> 00:58:54,684
They love me. Alive or dead.

568
00:58:58,734 --> 00:59:01,024
They will take me, no matter what.

569
00:59:01,025 --> 00:59:04,191
I wanted to hide here, to forget everything,

570
00:59:04,192 --> 00:59:06,725
To change my life, to marry me ...

571
00:59:07,692 --> 00:59:09,483
Then everything goes according to plan.

572
00:59:09,484 --> 00:59:12,517
Get married tomorrow. What is the problem?

573
00:59:14,317 --> 00:59:17,399
The problem is when I see you.

574
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:18,892
Yeah right!

575
00:59:19,650 --> 00:59:21,100
Clear!

576
00:59:21,859 --> 00:59:23,774
You make me remember what it was like.

577
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:26,975
I thought I no longer existed.

578
00:59:28,567 --> 00:59:31,142
You and your misfortune.

579
00:59:31,775 --> 00:59:33,809
Do not feel sorry for me.

580
00:59:34,234 --> 00:59:35,350
The door of my soul ...

581
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:36,404
Is closed to misfortune.

582
00:59:36,484 --> 00:59:38,017
There is no more space.

583
00:59:38,734 --> 00:59:41,559
I do not hear anything anymore, I do not see anything.

584
01:00:47,567 --> 01:00:49,353
Go home, bitch!

585
01:00:49,370 --> 01:00:50,394
Your boyfriend is waiting for you!

586
01:01:43,983 --> 01:01:47,600
What happened to her, my dear?

587
01:01:47,692 --> 01:01:49,423
We went to our hen party,

588
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:51,207
And we had an argument!

589
01:01:51,983 --> 01:01:54,607
There will be no further discussion!

590
01:01:54,608 --> 01:01:56,183
Just dance!

591
01:01:59,733 --> 01:02:01,14
Brother in law!

592
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:03,725
Brother in law!

593
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:06,933
Yes Yes! Come here!

594
01:02:13,942 --> 01:02:17,592
Can not you see my sister wants to dance?

595
01:02:17,958 --> 01:02:18,756
Come on.

596
01:02:34,858 --> 01:02:37,683
Come on. Come on!
Do not be embarrassing.

597
01:03:43,733 --> 01:03:45,827
What does that helicopter do in the valley?

598
01:03:46,817 --> 01:03:48,260
Humanitarian flights,

599
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:50,025
They are patrolling the buffer zone.

600
01:03:50,817 --> 01:03:52,774
The commands were warned yesterday.

601
01:03:52,775 --> 01:03:54,850
They had never dressed in black.

602
01:03:54,983 --> 01:03:57,392
They are well informed. Do not worry.

603
01:03:57,692 --> 01:03:59,100
It's okay.

604
01:04:15,567 --> 01:04:17,566
Today you are going to milk the cows,

605
01:04:17,567 --> 01:04:18,852
You bring the milk to the soldiers ...

606
01:04:18,861 --> 01:04:19,853
And you remarry Milena.

607
01:04:20,233 --> 01:04:21,528
I hold the priest ...

608
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:22,529
And we can delay the wedding a little.

609
01:04:23,192 --> 01:04:24,941
Why is it all so sudden?

610
01:04:24,942 --> 01:04:26,683
There is no time like the present!

611
01:04:47,191 --> 01:04:48,245
I know you are...

612
01:04:48,710 --> 01:04:51,030
The right man for Milena.

613
01:04:51,882 --> 01:04:54,891
Hey, was not it just sex without love, huh?

614
01:04:56,233 --> 01:04:59,266
- No sex!
- Sex, sex!

615
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:06,167
Sex! Sex!

616
01:05:08,483 --> 01:05:10,024
We do not have time, you know it well.

617
01:05:10,025 --> 01:05:12,725
Your biological clock is working.

618
01:05:16,233 --> 01:05:19,183
The poor girl always dreamed ...

619
01:05:19,608 --> 01:05:22,808
To marry the same day as his brother.

620
01:05:23,316 --> 01:05:27,808
And you know that I would do everything for my Milena.

621
01:05:27,858 --> 01:05:31,141
That's why you're getting married today, right?

622
01:05:36,275 --> 01:05:37,808
It's all set!

623
01:05:40,275 --> 01:05:42,315
Here it is, brother-in-law!

624
01:05:42,316 --> 01:05:45,357
Pizzicato. Free of tax, Abu Dhabi.

625
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:46,975
Come and try it on.

626
01:05:49,150 --> 01:05:50,850
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

627
01:05:53,066 --> 01:05:54,600
I do not like.

628
01:05:54,941 --> 01:05:56,379
You're going to be a different man.

629
01:05:57,441 --> 01:05:59,107
I am already a different man,
630
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:00,553
Since those times.

631
01:06:00,650 --> 01:06:02,690
Then you will be a different man again.

632
01:06:02,691 --> 01:06:06,308
Go and return in the evening. Hurry up.

633
01:07:17,108 --> 01:07:19,725
If that's what you call help, quit!

634
01:07:25,858 --> 01:07:29,350
- The blood is thicker than the water.
- Amazing!

635
01:07:52,941 --> 01:07:56,225
- I have my doubts...
- About what?

636
01:07:56,566 --> 01:07:58,808
On this peace, above all this.

637
01:07:58,816 --> 01:08:01,899
Stop that. The treaty is signed ...

638
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:03,495
By the great powers giving guarantee:

639
01:08:03,804 --> 01:08:06,726
Russia, U.S.A., Germany ... England.

640
01:09:30,441 --> 01:09:31,891
Bogdan!

641
01:09:39,649 --> 01:09:43,766
- Mila!
- Dear Kosta, thank God!

642
01:09:43,816 --> 01:09:45,181
He had gone home,

643
01:09:45,199 --> 01:09:48,478
With the little one when I heard the noise.

644
01:09:48,483 --> 01:09:51,023
I came out here, but I did not see anyone.

645
01:09:51,024 --> 01:09:52,974
I came back and they were all on the floor,

646
01:09:52,990 --> 01:09:53,975
No one was left standing!

647
01:09:54,649 --> 01:09:55,832
Some men appeared ...

648
01:09:55,849 --> 01:09:56,833
With black shirts.

649
01:09:57,524 --> 01:09:59,539
I think they were shot, I have no idea.

650
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:02,694
I was scared by my granddaughter,

651
01:10:02,710 --> 01:10:04,393
Concerned to save her.

652
01:10:04,899 --> 01:10:07,065
But how did you get saved?

653
01:10:07,066 --> 01:10:10,224
I ... I was carrying the milk.

654
01:10:18,691 --> 01:10:20,808
A snake saved me.

655
01:10:20,858 --> 01:10:23,349
That is Kosta, it was God's will.

656
01:10:23,358 --> 01:10:25,183
All people have their destiny,

657
01:10:25,199 --> 01:10:26,690
one way or another...

658
01:10:26,816 --> 01:10:28,690
Man is born with him,

659
01:10:28,691 --> 01:10:31,023
And accompanies him throughout his life.

660
01:10:31,024 --> 01:10:32,940
Where was Bogdan?

661
01:10:32,941 --> 01:10:37,016
He has always been one of them.

662
01:10:37,024 --> 01:10:39,190
He was looking for an Italian woman.

663
01:10:39,191 --> 01:10:40,982
As he did not find it,

664
01:10:40,983 --> 01:10:42,857
Went from house to house with those men.

665
01:10:42,858 --> 01:10:44,270
Then came a helicopter,

666
01:10:44,290 --> 01:10:47,184
And they all went to Klobuk.

667
01:10:47,316 --> 01:10:48,572
To look for her.

668
01:10:48,590 --> 01:10:49,610
I do not know if they will find it.

669
01:11:09,608 --> 01:11:10,982
Socrates calling Homer.

670
01:11:10,983 --> 01:11:13,224
<I> Socrates calling Homer, change. </ I>

671
01:11:13,733 --> 01:11:15,766
<I> Socrates calling Homer, change. </ I>

672
01:11:17,524 --> 01:11:19,732
The decrease of insects
Is in the final phase.

673
01:11:19,733 --> 01:11:21,982
Mosquitos neutralized in both places.

674
01:11:21,983 --> 01:11:24,037
<I> All clean, do not fly a butterfly. </ I>

675
01:11:24,316 --> 01:11:25,735
I need support from a helicopter ...

676
01:11:25,750 --> 01:11:27,318
To pick up participants.

677
01:11:27,353 --> 01:11:28,849
Do not let them see you.

678
01:11:32,816 --> 01:11:34,641
<I> Open line with the helicopter. </ I>

679
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:36,069
<I> Coordinates? </ I>

680
01:11:36,819 --> 01:11:41,690
<I> Coordinates:42 °, 42 minutes ... </ i>

681
01:13:20,899 --> 01:13:22,141
Kosta!

682
01:13:31,232 --> 01:13:35,641
Friend! Friend!
What are you doing here?

683
01:13:50,357 --> 01:13:51,849
Kosta!

684
01:19:36,232 --> 01:19:38,765
What would you be without war?

685
01:19:41,107 --> 01:19:42,056
If there was no war?

686
01:19:42,069 --> 01:19:43,057
What work would you have?

687
01:19:47,898 --> 01:19:51,307
I think i would have
My own TV show,

688
01:19:51,455 --> 01:19:52,333
And that I would find my knight ...

689
01:19:52,334 --> 01:19:53,334
Of gleaming armor.

690
01:19:53,398 --> 01:19:56,439
And then you would marry a rich Italian,

691
01:19:56,440 --> 01:19:57,175
Because the armor ...

692
01:19:57,190 --> 01:19:58,176
The knight would rust.

693
01:19:58,940 --> 01:20:00,394
You would have children,

694
01:20:00,644 --> 01:20:01,934
And he would have betrayed you.

695
01:20:02,006 --> 01:20:03,006
And you would have gone.

696
01:20:05,107 --> 01:20:08,140
Would that be the end, for me or for him?

697
01:20:08,690 --> 01:20:10,314
It takes a happy ending.

698
01:20:10,315 --> 01:20:11,674
Fate would tell the story ...

699
01:20:11,690 --> 01:20:12,675
in a different way.

700
01:22:35,023 --> 01:22:36,848
Hello! Anyone here?

701
01:24:33,148 --> 01:24:34,681
Are you hungry?

702
01:24:34,940 --> 01:24:36,390
Not now.

703
01:26:01,689 --> 01:26:03,098
You're cute.

704
01:26:03,731 --> 01:26:05,598
It is my sad destiny!

705
01:26:05,606 --> 01:26:07,306
Yeah right!
706
01:26:07,981 --> 01:26:10,022
My beauty did not bring me anything
Besides misfortunes,

707
01:26:10,023 --> 01:26:11,897
As with you and your kindness.

708
01:26:11,898 --> 01:26:14,723
Bring out the worst in people.

709
01:26:16,023 --> 01:26:18,323
Scott was a good man,

710
01:26:18,334 --> 01:26:19,989
At first, in the Blue Helmets,

711
01:26:20,148 --> 01:26:21,844
He saved me from the prison camp ...

712
01:26:21,860 --> 01:26:22,845
And took me with him.

713
01:26:24,731 --> 01:26:26,563
And then he became a bastard.

714
01:26:26,564 --> 01:26:27,724
Our department ...

715
01:26:27,738 --> 01:26:28,725
It became my prison.

716
01:26:30,606 --> 01:26:33,306
- Will you take me to Rome?
- Yes!

717
01:26:33,731 --> 01:26:35,191
You will have to teach me to live again,

718
01:26:35,209 --> 01:26:36,102
From the beginning!

719
01:26:36,648 --> 01:26:38,827
Could you play in a hotel bar?

720
01:26:38,845 --> 01:26:39,828
Do not even think about it.

721
01:26:39,898 --> 01:26:41,095
This is worse than any chase ...

722
01:26:41,108 --> 01:26:42,096
Or bloodthirsty murderers.

723
01:26:42,689 --> 01:26:45,764
No one can escape these types.

724
01:26:55,564 --> 01:26:57,470
In this case what can we do,

725
01:26:58,500 --> 01:26:59,592
Besides fleeing?

726
01:27:01,773 --> 01:27:02,826
You have no idea...

727
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:04,481
What is to spend the life running away.

728
01:27:04,648 --> 01:27:08,473
I know, yes. I know it very well.

729
01:33:41,647 --> 01:33:43,713
<I> The great champion Zubac! </ I>

730
01:33:43,730 --> 01:33:45,399
<I> Who will bet on it? </ I>

731
01:33:51,439 --> 01:33:52,847
<I> Come on, Zubac! </ I>

732
01:33:54,647 --> 01:33:58,055
<I> Bet Zubac!
You can, Zubac! </ I>

733
01:34:01,772 --> 01:34:03,722
<I> You can! Yes! </ I>

734
01:34:14,897 --> 01:34:16,450
<I> The great champion Zubac was defeated. </ I>

735
01:34:16,465 --> 01:34:18,139
I want revenge!

736
01:38:02,230 --> 01:38:04,430
My leg, my leg!

737
01:38:17,605 --> 01:38:20,638
Leave me, it does not make sense.

738
01:38:22,105 --> 01:38:23,680
You're an Idiot!

739
01:38:25,230 --> 01:38:28,180
It's the only thing that makes sense,

740
01:38:28,980 --> 01:38:32,930
To love someone, whatever.

741
01:39:39,438 --> 01:39:42,388
Look! How do you say?

742
01:39:43,230 --> 01:39:45,555
- He's having a baby.
- He's going to give birth, to give birth.

743
01:39:59,646 --> 01:40:01,346
Go refresh yourself.

744
01:40:21,730 --> 01:40:27,346
The green meadow, the wet grass,

745
01:40:27,938 --> 01:40:33,055
Mount Javor, mount Javor.

746
01:40:34,730 --> 01:40:39,221
Who keeps the herds, my dear ...

747
01:42:45,116 --> 01:42:45,842
I'm going to die.

748
01:42:45,900 --> 01:42:48,569
No, you're not going to die. Be patient.

749
01:43:10,688 --> 01:43:14,804
A ladybug! They are lucky.

750
01:43:15,521 --> 01:43:17,221
I'm scared.

751
01:43:30,688 --> 01:43:32,846
WATCH OUT! MINE!

752
01:44:58,354 --> 01:44:59,513
Come on!

753
01:45:08,604 --> 01:45:09,971
Where are you going?

754
01:45:25,396 --> 01:45:26,771
Why are they shot from behind,

755
01:45:26,790 --> 01:45:27,772
Fucking bastards!

756
01:45:45,938 --> 01:45:48,138
High! Do not move!

757
01:45:53,396 --> 01:45:54,763
Hands up.

758
01:46:07,813 --> 01:46:09,304
Do not move!

759
01:46:13,563 --> 01:46:15,888
You're all that I have.

760
01:46:15,938 --> 01:46:17,263
Listen to me.

761
01:46:18,646 --> 01:46:22,054
I go to the front and you follow me.

762
01:46:22,063 --> 01:46:23,554
You understand?

763
01:46:30,438 --> 01:46:31,804
Do not worry.

764
01:46:37,021 --> 01:46:39,137
Well done, bastard!

765
01:46:52,687 --> 01:46:54,137
Do not move!

766
01:46:54,937 --> 01:46:56,398
You must not die,

767
01:46:56,910 --> 01:46:58,039
You are totally innocent

768
01:47:28,729 --> 01:47:30,346
Do not touch it!

769
01:47:31,271 --> 01:47:33,971
Do not! Do not!

770
01:48:24,396 --> 01:48:26,096
We're safe!

771
01:48:26,187 --> 01:48:27,887
Here the road is free!

772
01:48:28,854 --> 01:48:30,054
Come!

773
01:48:39,146 --> 01:48:40,346
High!

774
01:48:40,812 --> 01:48:43,721
Tall, tall!

775
01:48:50,104 --> 01:48:51,804
Leave the snake!

776
01:48:53,521 --> 01:48:55,679
She wants to save you!

777
01:48:58,562 --> 01:49:00,179
Do not move! High!

778
01:49:01,354 --> 01:49:02,596
Do not!

779
01:50:04,812 --> 01:50:09,929
Where are you going? Oh my god!

780
01:50:11,187 --> 01:50:12,720
Where are you going?

781
01:50:14,854 --> 01:50:17,054
Do you want to kill yourself?

782
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:18,884
If you kill yourself,

783
01:50:19,347 --> 01:50:21,691
Who will remember the girl ...

784
01:50:22,062 --> 01:50:24,262
And your love, idiot?

785
01:50:24,604 --> 01:50:27,637
That way things are not done, my friend.

786
01:50:28,520 --> 01:50:30,137
Leave me alone!

787
01:51:13,062 --> 01:51:16,220
15 YEARS LATER.

788
01:56:04,770 --> 01:56:06,720
How did the dress come to stop here?

789
01:56:08,353 --> 01:56:10,637
It's not like we're in heaven.

790
01:56:10,853 --> 01:56:11,930
How is it possible?

791
01:56:12,600 --> 01:56:14,084
You deserve heaven twice!

792
01:56:15,770 --> 01:56:17,352
One thing missing.

793
01:56:17,353 --> 01:56:19,091
Do you want me to be here with you?

794
01:56:19,400 --> 01:56:20,392
Forever!

795
01:56:20,562 --> 01:56:22,178
There is no hurry.

796
01:56:23,145 --> 01:56:24,533
When you come,

797
01:56:25,372 --> 01:56:27,188
we'll be together forever!

798
01:56:27,895 --> 01:56:29,428
Exactly.
