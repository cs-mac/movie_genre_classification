- Dear Madame.

- Go now.

- Doctor?
- It hardly seems the time.

However, one must, for the sake
of one's conscience...

And Valerie de Marneffe.

of your kind heart.

As always, Cousin.
Do you remember our garden?

22

- At Saint-Aubin?
- The lilacs.

23
00:03:57,109 --> 00:03:59,977
- Black as plums.
- I would like some at my grave.

24

You have always loved
beautiful things.

You never minded.

29
00:04:24,612 --> 00:04:27,775
A family like ours could only
push forward one girl.

30

Your beauty benefited all of us.

I had seen her married.

I hope I might speak candidly
to you on the subject of...

- Always.
- About a matter...

Delicate?

Needing a mother. Who better?
Who a more logical choice?

Well, you know I love Hortense
as if she were my own daughter.

You don't think it
unseemly haste?

67

Don't you think we should wait?

68
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,427
- We should wait.
- On the other hand...

69

It is what our dear Adeline
would have wanted.

I'll tell the children.

00:18:04,903 --> 00:18:07,031
She believes
she can live on air.

163
00:18:08,141 --> 00:18:11,669
Talk to her, Cousin.
Tell her to be practical.

164
00:18:12,881 --> 00:18:15,350
You've lived all these years
without love.

165
00:18:15,384 --> 00:18:16,783
Hasn't made you unhappy.

166
00:18:20,289 --> 00:18:21,757
I'll see what I can do.

167
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:26,061
MAN: I live mostly on my estate
in the Languedoc.

168
00:18:26,097 --> 00:18:28,760
I find the presence of sheep
and cows very soothing.

169
00:18:29,869 --> 00:18:31,200
Don't you, Mademoiselle?

170
00:18:37,879 --> 00:18:40,314
My neighbor, the Count D'Artois,

171
00:18:40,349 --> 00:18:44,218
argues that the goat's "<i>'</i>na-a-h"<i>'</i>
has more character,

172
00:18:44,254 --> 00:18:45,847
but I find it disturbing.

173
00:18:50,761 --> 00:18:53,230
SECOND MAN: As I always say
to my dear friend,

174
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,733
your father the Baron,

175
00:18:55,768 --> 00:19:00,502
"<i>'</i>Hector, a title is good,
but money is better."<i>'</i>

176
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:01,941
[Sniffing]

177
00:19:02,944 --> 00:19:04,240
[Snorting]

178
00:19:04,278 --> 00:19:07,373
Yes... my dear Hortense,

179
00:19:07,415 --> 00:19:12,684
above all... reigns...
the holy... venerated...

180
00:19:12,722 --> 00:19:16,284
substantial... beautiful...
noble...

181
00:19:17,195 --> 00:19:19,186
...and all-powerful franc.

182
00:19:21,499 --> 00:19:25,267
Do you, uh... know why I've come?

183
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,409
Marry me, my little butterfly.

184
00:19:29,476 --> 00:19:32,913
Get up at once, Monsieur,
or I shall ring the bell!

185
00:19:32,948 --> 00:19:35,110
- It's exquisite.
- Monsieur, get up!

186
00:19:36,752 --> 00:19:38,687
- You won't marry me?
- Never!

187
00:19:39,623 --> 00:19:43,890
I'll give you 200,000 francs for
a glimpse of your naked body.

188
00:19:43,928 --> 00:19:46,762
- Never!
- But why?

189
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,098
You're... too... horrible!

190
00:19:50,402 --> 00:19:53,531
I? The wealthiest man in Paris?

191
00:19:54,474 --> 00:19:57,273
Prodigy parfumier
to the great Buritaud?

192
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:59,303
Chevalier
of the Legion of Honor?

193
00:19:59,381 --> 00:20:00,848
Lord Mayor of Paris?

194
00:20:02,418 --> 00:20:04,819
- And I'm horrible?
- She's spoiled.

195
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:08,417
She has no idea
what her situation is.

196
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:13,129
Monsieur Crevel,

197
00:20:13,164 --> 00:20:16,532
it's possible I have
a more attractive proposition.

198
00:20:16,569 --> 00:20:17,558
Oh?

199
00:20:18,639 --> 00:20:20,436
You know the baron is
the protector...

200
00:20:20,474 --> 00:20:22,305
of the famous singer
Jenny Cadine?

201
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:26,075
An arrangement that makes him
the envy of all Paris.

202
00:20:26,147 --> 00:20:28,378
- He's given her up.
- What?

203
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:29,678
For the moment.

204
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:33,250
If you like, I could arrange...

205
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:36,454
I would give 50,000
to snaffle that imperious,

206
00:20:36,494 --> 00:20:39,089
half-baked aristocrat's mistress
away from him.

207
00:20:40,132 --> 00:20:44,536
Oh, what a joke... if I got in
while he was snoozing.

208
00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:50,170
You know, if I had to choose
between you and the baron...

209
00:20:50,211 --> 00:20:54,170
I mean, Monsieur Hulot is
a clever, handsome man,

210
00:20:54,215 --> 00:20:57,049
but... you, you're...

211
00:20:58,155 --> 00:20:59,520
Solid.

212
00:21:03,194 --> 00:21:05,789
Meet me at
the Théatre des Variétés,

213
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:07,421
Saturday evening at 10:00.

214
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:10,861
By all means.

215
00:21:12,706 --> 00:21:13,968
At your service.

216
00:21:19,448 --> 00:21:20,915
Adieu.

217
00:21:20,949 --> 00:21:22,610
HORTENSE:
The idea of substituting...

218
00:21:22,651 --> 00:21:25,485
a marriage contract for
true love makes my heart shiver.

219
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:28,918
Is that why you never married?

220
00:21:30,294 --> 00:21:33,696
I dreamed of marrying once,
when I was very young.

221
00:21:34,967 --> 00:21:36,662
Younger than you are now.

222
00:21:40,073 --> 00:21:43,601
- Young and deeply in love.
- What happened?

223
00:21:45,014 --> 00:21:47,779
- He married someone else.
- No!

224
00:21:48,785 --> 00:21:51,482
- Did you ever see him again?
- [Baron humming]

225
00:21:55,993 --> 00:21:57,153
Never.

226
00:22:27,198 --> 00:22:28,689
[Man coughing]

227
00:22:35,276 --> 00:22:37,335

[Gasps]

230
00:23:15,126 --> 00:23:16,457
[Coughing]

231
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:22,068
Oh... foolish boy,
what have you done?

232
00:23:24,171 --> 00:23:26,570
Well, we won't speak
about it now.

233
00:23:28,041 --> 00:23:29,201
BETTE: No.

234
00:24:09,827 --> 00:24:11,659
Poor thing, sleep.

235
00:25:12,973 --> 00:25:14,270
Don't be alarmed.

236
00:25:15,276 --> 00:25:17,871
It's Mademoiselle Fisher.
I live downstairs.

237
00:25:19,714 --> 00:25:22,582
Oh. Oh, with a head like that,

238
00:25:22,618 --> 00:25:26,555
there's nothing like a good
onion soup and buttered bread.

239
00:25:27,358 --> 00:25:29,222
MAN: I'm sorry. I...

240
00:25:29,259 --> 00:25:32,593
BETTE: Let's not refer to
your foolishness of last night.

241
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:34,963
I know you're in
desperate circumstances.

242
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:41,239
Your rat traps have kept me
alive for weeks. Did you know?

243
00:25:41,275 --> 00:25:44,439
I know what it's like
to be hungry without friends.

244
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:50,176
I have some savings.
I could help you if you like.

245
00:25:51,188 --> 00:25:53,714
You are too generous.

246
00:25:53,792 --> 00:25:56,625
You'll give me receipts
for the money I spend for you.

247
00:25:58,597 --> 00:26:02,363
And when you are rich,
you can repay it all.

248
00:26:04,705 --> 00:26:07,038
You shall be
the whole world to me.

249
00:26:07,075 --> 00:26:08,940
I shall be your slave.

250
00:26:13,215 --> 00:26:15,843
Will you do
everything I tell you?

251
00:26:15,884 --> 00:26:17,944
Yes, of course.

252
00:26:17,987 --> 00:26:20,148
Then I shall embrace you
as my own.

253
00:26:24,863 --> 00:26:28,425
Here I have a boy...
risen from the grave.

00:26:45,589 --> 00:26:47,785
- You're singing.
- What?

259
00:26:47,825 --> 00:26:49,554
I've never heard you sound
so cheerful.

260

[Audience applauding]

On the other side of heaven

262
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:12,014
I'll be waiting for you

264

And the sky's baby blue

On the other side of heaven

As you fly to me, fly to me,

268
00:27:33,181 --> 00:27:38,177
Fly...

269
00:27:38,254 --> 00:27:41,486
On a gossamer wing

270
00:27:45,931 --> 00:27:47,456
[Audience applauding
and cheering]

271
00:28:01,818 --> 00:28:02,876
Why are you here?

272
00:28:07,792 --> 00:28:11,820
BETTE: He has bold lips
and a sad smile.

273
00:28:11,897 --> 00:28:14,560
HORTENSE: I knew it.
And he's terribly poor.

274
00:28:14,601 --> 00:28:17,628
BETTE: Nearly starved.
HORTENSE: How romantic.

275
00:28:18,872 --> 00:28:22,604
- How old is he?
- Twenty... five.

276
00:28:23,812 --> 00:28:26,577
BETTE: Would you stop
interrogating me?

277
00:28:26,616 --> 00:28:29,210
HORTENSE: Fifteen years
younger than you.

278
00:28:29,252 --> 00:28:31,687
Now I know he can't exist.

279
00:28:31,722 --> 00:28:36,455
BETTE: You little girls think
only yourselves can have lovers.

280
00:28:36,494 --> 00:28:39,088
HORTENSE: Then prove to me
he isn't a fairy tale.

281
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,973
He's a sculptor.
He made this for me.

282
00:28:55,018 --> 00:28:56,953
I've never seen anything
so beautiful.

283
00:28:56,987 --> 00:29:00,583
And there's another. The Four
Horsemen of the Apocalypse.

284
00:29:00,625 --> 00:29:03,686
An antique dealer in my
neighborhood has it in his shop.

285
00:29:03,729 --> 00:29:05,753
What's your sweetheart's name?

286
00:29:06,832 --> 00:29:09,734
- Can you keep a secret?
- Of course.

287
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:13,036
Do you swear... on your happiness
in this world?

288
00:29:13,074 --> 00:29:14,564
I swear.

289
00:29:17,947 --> 00:29:20,780
- Wenceslas.
- Wenceslas.

290
00:29:24,821 --> 00:29:28,155
Let me keep it, please.
Just for a little while.

291
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:32,121
It's so pretty.
It will cheer me up.

292
00:29:37,503 --> 00:29:39,164
Just for a little while, then.

293
00:29:45,847 --> 00:29:47,110
[Knocking on ceiling]

294
00:30:17,087 --> 00:30:20,785
Here, Wenceslas.
Look what I've brought you.

295
00:30:20,859 --> 00:30:22,587
Bette, you're amazing.

296
00:30:24,996 --> 00:30:26,157
Well, eat one
and stop staring at me.

297
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:32,403
Have you been working?

298
00:30:39,213 --> 00:30:41,842
You don't seem to progress
very far.

299
00:30:41,884 --> 00:30:43,648
I'm not sure you deserve these.

300
00:30:45,855 --> 00:30:50,089
Well, you know, dear lady,
there is a saying.

301
00:30:51,396 --> 00:30:55,163
Life is more than work alone.

302
00:31:00,742 --> 00:31:03,769
Make a fortune first,
and then you may have your fun.

303
00:31:03,846 --> 00:31:06,577
And what if I die
before I get rich?

304
00:31:06,616 --> 00:31:11,383
Oh, I won't let you die.
I have life enough for two.

305
00:31:13,458 --> 00:31:17,259
By the way, Hortense thought
your bronze bird very nice.

306
00:31:17,296 --> 00:31:18,786
What did your pretty cousin say?

307
00:31:20,867 --> 00:31:24,030
- Who told you she was pretty?
- You did.

308
00:31:26,741 --> 00:31:29,506
Goodness.
Your sleeve needs mending.

309
00:31:29,544 --> 00:31:30,977
I've been neglecting you.

310
00:31:31,046 --> 00:31:35,177
I imagine she must be the most
beautiful young woman in Paris.

311
00:31:35,251 --> 00:31:38,016
To get out of your predicament,
you must spend...

312
00:31:38,055 --> 00:31:40,819
more time on your work and
less time imagining my cousin.

313
00:31:44,529 --> 00:31:45,621
Mademoiselle!

314
00:31:50,604 --> 00:31:52,333
This wax should keep you busy.

315
00:31:53,541 --> 00:31:56,511
And I've made you a schedule,
much like my own.

316
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:01,480
You work without distraction
from sunrise until noon.

317
00:32:03,053 --> 00:32:06,023
And after a light lunch,
you resume work...

318
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:07,558
until dinner at 6:00,

319
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:09,958
except on Wednesdays,

00:45:12,306 --> 00:45:14,798
- Walking.
- That's ridiculous.

477
00:45:14,877 --> 00:45:17,472
- Why were you walking?
- I was restless.

478
00:45:17,547 --> 00:45:19,981
Muddled, really. I thought
a walk would do me good.

- Work does you good.
- I work night and day.

You call those little red

what good art I'll make then.

reminded of the debt I owe you.

But it was purchased
by Cesar Crevel.

Yes. He must have

Love is the master,

You are the slave

How can one improve upon it?

640
01:00:04,924 --> 01:00:07,985
- Italian?
- Greek.

641
01:00:08,028 --> 01:00:10,690
- Intimidating.
- Not at all.

MAN: I mean, the space.
It's larger than Medais.

So is my talent, dear friend.

This mountain of marble is to be
my first major work.

It is to my future works...

what Raphael's "<i>'</i>Marriage
of the Virgin"<i>'</i> was to his.

Show me the plaster model.

There isn't one.

- You are a genius.
- Ah, it's all up here.

650
01:00:43,571 --> 01:00:46,302
You know what they say. Between
the plaster and the marble,

651

a masterpiece may be ruined.

Claude Vignon?

Will next week do? You'll
have made progress by then.

I intend to do nothing but work.

I will snatch fire from heaven

What is it?

01:01:30,162 --> 01:01:33,326
Wenceslas hasn't worked a day
since we've been married.

664
01:01:34,969 --> 01:01:36,938
A sensible girl
marries an artist...

after he's made his fortune.

666

He talks about working,
but nothing has been done.

to take back the commission.

Will you be long?
I'll be waiting in the carriage.

I don't want to go.

672
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:07,137
You'd be wise
to keep an eye on him.

673
01:02:07,978 --> 01:02:09,411
An eye on Wenceslas?

What begins as a flirtation
more often than not...

- Is Daddy a flirt? No.
- Especially for an artist.

You're the flirt, aren't you?

677

A man with
a passionate temperament.

- What is it, rabbit?
- Never mind.

I'm sure there's nothing
to the talk.

Wenceslas worships

it's a question of temperature.

- I'm not feeling very well.
- None of this is real.

What is real is the secret
language of the stone.

It tells me when
I'm ready to create.

01:10:08,045 --> 01:10:12,142
and pay a small amount,
on account, to each of you.

790
01:10:13,251 --> 01:10:14,343
Mademoiselle Olivier.

791
01:10:18,124 --> 01:10:22,153
- Ah... here is my father!
- Hector! Dear!

792
01:10:22,196 --> 01:10:24,494
HORTENSE: He'll know what to do.
BETTE: What happened?

793
01:10:29,004 --> 01:10:32,600
And only last week, a new pair
of boots and a green velvet...

794
01:10:32,676 --> 01:10:37,512
Stop. My dear, creatures like
that don't know what love is.

795
01:10:37,548 --> 01:10:40,211
- Oh, Cousin...
- You're lucky to be rid of her.

796
01:10:42,954 --> 01:10:44,945
And there is your honor
to think of.

797
01:10:51,465 --> 01:10:52,490
My honor?

798
01:10:52,534 --> 01:10:55,299
You're the Baron
Hector Pierre Hulot.

799
01:10:56,572 --> 01:10:58,062
Yes?

800
01:10:58,107 --> 01:11:00,474
Well, you can't let
such an affront pass.

801
01:11:03,448 --> 01:11:07,681
- N-No.
- You must have satisfaction.

802
01:11:12,058 --> 01:11:13,286
Yes.

803
01:11:14,427 --> 01:11:21,267
Yes! I must have satisfaction
from that... that... businessman!

804
01:11:23,339 --> 01:11:24,465
My pistols!

805
01:11:24,507 --> 01:11:26,703
- One!
- Crevel's as good as dead.

806
01:11:26,744 --> 01:11:28,644
He's never held a pistol before.

807
01:11:28,679 --> 01:11:31,477
- Two!
- We could all be in danger.

808
01:11:31,515 --> 01:11:34,212
- Three!
- Why won't you discuss it?

809
01:11:34,252 --> 01:11:37,245
MAN: Four!
BARON: You have dishonored me.

810
01:11:37,323 --> 01:11:41,090
- Five!
- And stolen my little songbird.

811
01:11:41,128 --> 01:11:43,596
- Six!
- But...

812
01:11:43,663 --> 01:11:46,599
MAN: Seven!
CREVEL: Baron, please!

813
01:11:46,634 --> 01:11:49,900
- Eight!
- I'm half your size!

814
01:11:49,938 --> 01:11:52,635
- Nine!
- There must be another...

815
01:11:52,675 --> 01:11:56,077
Ten! Turn... and fire!

816
01:12:01,988 --> 01:12:05,015
Hector! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry!

817
01:12:07,361 --> 01:12:09,125
BARON: My knee! My knee!

818
01:12:10,698 --> 01:12:13,667
My friend! What have I done?

819
01:12:15,304 --> 01:12:17,864
Cesar, my friend.
My dear friend.

820
01:12:22,180 --> 01:12:24,842
- Who would like to be first?
- Hector.

821
01:12:32,192 --> 01:12:33,454
[Booing and jeering]

822
01:12:38,533 --> 01:12:39,932
[Applause]

823
01:12:48,010 --> 01:12:51,071
Thank you, Mayor Crevel,
for those kind words.

824
01:12:52,717 --> 01:12:54,241
This is a glorious day.

825
01:12:55,387 --> 01:12:59,381
A day that represents a double
honor for the Hulot family.

826
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:03,359
Firstly,
the courage of my uncle,

827
01:13:03,397 --> 01:13:06,094
General Pierre Hulot
de Forzheim...

828
01:13:06,134 --> 01:13:10,401
his lifetime of service
to the Emperor Napoleon...

829
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:14,845
and to our country as a soldier
in the grand army of France.

830
01:13:19,351 --> 01:13:24,289
And this historic occasion
also marks the debut...

831
01:13:24,323 --> 01:13:28,591
of my brilliant and talented
son-in-law...

832
01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:32,021
Count Wenceslas Steinbach.

833
01:13:37,239 --> 01:13:40,835
We have all waited with keen
anticipation for this moment.

834
01:13:42,179 --> 01:13:45,343
And so, without further ado...

835
01:14:00,568 --> 01:14:01,797
Marvelous.

836
01:14:06,076 --> 01:14:07,441
Marvelous!

837
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:10,204
[Crowd outside gate booing]

838
01:14:21,329 --> 01:14:22,762
After all I've done for you!

839
01:14:24,131 --> 01:14:27,568
Practically bankrupted me
with this studio... for these!

840

"<i>'</i>A poor piece of work."<i>'</i>
"<i>'</i>Decorative."<i>'</i>

841
01:14:31,675 --> 01:14:33,869
What have you been doing
in here?

842
01:14:33,910 --> 01:14:36,971
An artist can't always
please the rabble.

843
01:14:37,014 --> 01:14:39,609
Rabble?! Rabble?!

844
01:14:39,651 --> 01:14:41,711
These are the opinions
of the critics!

845
01:14:41,754 --> 01:14:43,619
Blockheads. Ignoramuses.

846
01:14:43,656 --> 01:14:45,352
Oh, shut up!

847
01:14:45,392 --> 01:14:48,020
Shut up, or I'll have you
thrown in jail.

848
01:14:48,061 --> 01:14:50,029
You've humiliated me, ruined me!

849
01:14:51,332 --> 01:14:55,292
You must pay back the
commission... every penny of it.

850
01:14:55,371 --> 01:14:56,497
Listen to this.

851
01:14:56,572 --> 01:15:01,033
"<i>'</i>Steinbach should give up
large-scale sculptures...

852
01:15:01,112 --> 01:15:04,309
"<i>'</i>and concentrate
on romantic groups,

853
01:15:04,348 --> 01:15:07,011
"<i>'</i>small figures, jewelry."<i>'</i>

854
01:15:08,087 --> 01:15:09,179
Jewelry!

855
01:15:11,959 --> 01:15:15,794
I'm going to the ministry.
I'll make a personal apology...

856
01:15:15,830 --> 01:15:18,560
and assure my colleagues that
all the money will be repaid.

857
01:15:24,341 --> 01:15:27,709
It's all right. We'll simply
return the commission.

858
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:31,975
- It's gone.
- Gone?

859
01:15:34,185 --> 01:15:37,850
What do you mean?
Well, surely it's not gone.

860
01:15:37,891 --> 01:15:41,851
You can't have spent 200,000
francs in less than a year!

861
01:15:41,896 --> 01:15:44,331
How do you think
we've been living so well?

862
01:15:44,366 --> 01:15:47,199
If by living well
you mean your imported marble,

863
01:15:47,269 --> 01:15:49,260
your restaurants,
your entertaining,

864
01:15:49,337 --> 01:15:50,429
your flashy wardrobe...

865
01:15:50,505 --> 01:15:52,406
So now it's my fault. I see.

866
01:15:52,442 --> 01:15:56,140
In all this time, I've bought
a baby's pram and a new parasol.

867
01:15:56,180 --> 01:15:57,374
WENCESLAS: Congratulations.

868
01:15:57,414 --> 01:15:59,383
Perhaps we should announce it
in the paper.

869
01:15:59,417 --> 01:16:02,148
Perhaps you'll find
a few sympathetic readers.

870
01:16:02,188 --> 01:16:05,556
Well, let me make myself
perfectly clear.

871
01:16:05,592 --> 01:16:09,495
If anyone thinks I'll take
responsibility for his debts,

872
01:16:09,530 --> 01:16:10,827
they are mistaken.

873
01:16:10,866 --> 01:16:14,667
I'm already up to my nostrils
in debt because of Father.

874
01:16:14,704 --> 01:16:17,036
I won't be left holding the bag!

875
01:16:21,212 --> 01:16:22,440
WENCESLAS: I'm sick of it...

876
01:16:23,814 --> 01:16:29,254
...of you, of your family,
of that endlessly crying baby!

877
01:16:29,322 --> 01:16:30,881
You're mean and cruel!

878
01:16:30,924 --> 01:16:34,087
If you're so holy, why don't
you go out and get the money?

879
01:16:34,129 --> 01:16:36,756
- All right. I will.
- Ha!

880
01:16:36,797 --> 01:16:39,767
You want me to get the money?
Because I can get it.

881
01:16:39,801 --> 01:16:43,568
- Do you hear me? I can get it!
- That's a joke!

882
01:16:47,110 --> 01:16:49,409
Artists should never marry.

883
01:16:49,447 --> 01:16:51,415
I know someone
who'll loan you the money.

884
01:16:51,449 --> 01:16:55,216
Oh, what imbecile
would lend me money now?

885
01:16:55,287 --> 01:16:58,121
Someone who has
a special interest in art.

886
01:16:58,158 --> 01:17:00,456
You must come
and meet her personally.

887
01:17:00,493 --> 01:17:03,224
- Her?
- Jenny Cadine.

888
01:17:03,264 --> 01:17:07,760
The baron's mistress?
Hortense would never agree.

889
01:17:08,571 --> 01:17:10,436
Then you must go
without her knowing.

890
01:17:13,410 --> 01:17:14,776
What else can you do?

891
01:17:18,350 --> 01:17:21,877
But listen, Wenceslas,
I love you both too much...

892
01:17:21,921 --> 01:17:23,718
not to warn you of the danger.

893
01:17:25,292 --> 01:17:27,784
If you go, you must hold fast
to your heart.

894
01:17:30,131 --> 01:17:31,565
The woman is a demon.

895
01:17:33,068 --> 01:17:35,594
And I would never
forgive myself...

896
01:17:35,672 --> 01:17:37,936
if you were unfaithful
to my niece.

897
01:17:44,416 --> 01:17:47,648
CREVEL: Madame!
HORTENSE: Good morning.

898
01:17:48,921 --> 01:17:51,686
Thank you for coming
at such short notice.

899
01:17:51,725 --> 01:17:53,419
Fair lady, at your service.

900
01:17:53,459 --> 01:17:55,325
My dear, kind Monsieur Crevel...

901
01:17:56,496 --> 01:17:59,523
I've asked you here for a matter
of the greatest importance.

902
01:18:01,003 --> 01:18:04,804
I've thought long and hard
about your offer.

903
01:18:04,841 --> 01:18:08,642
- My offer?
- 200,000 for a glimpse.

904
01:18:08,679 --> 01:18:11,046
- That was a year ago.
- I'm ready.

905
01:18:11,083 --> 01:18:16,283
- But why now?
- Do not ask for explanations.

906
01:18:16,322 --> 01:18:18,985
Only do this one thing for me.

907
01:18:19,026 --> 01:18:22,394
You can be sure there is nothing
my gratitude will withhold.

908
01:18:22,430 --> 01:18:25,763
- One thing?
- Well, give me... give...

909
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:29,066
No, do not give, but lend.

910
01:18:29,105 --> 01:18:32,337
Lend to the one whom you once
called your little butterfly.

911
01:18:34,345 --> 01:18:37,041
I need 200,000 francs.

912
01:18:38,384 --> 01:18:40,750
Ah. I see.

913
01:18:41,987 --> 01:18:43,284
Get up, my dear.

914
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:50,197
You need only ask. The daughter
of my dearest friend,

915
01:18:50,231 --> 01:18:52,325
you'll be denied nothing.

916
01:18:52,367 --> 01:18:54,096
You'll have your money
within the hour.

917
01:18:54,136 --> 01:18:57,402
Oh... thank you. Thank you!

918
01:19:10,424 --> 01:19:12,949
BETTE: Monsieur Crevel,
thank God I've caught you.

919
01:19:13,026 --> 01:19:15,495
CREVEL: Mademoiselle Fisher,
what is it? Good heavens!

920
01:19:15,530 --> 01:19:18,796
- Hortense told me everything.
- She did?

921
01:19:18,834 --> 01:19:21,804
- Your life is in danger.
- It is?

922
01:19:22,605 --> 01:19:24,801
There... across the street
behind the lamp.

923
01:19:25,675 --> 01:19:27,143
- What?
- Count Steinbach.

924
01:19:27,178 --> 01:19:28,770
- There?
- He knows about you.

925
01:19:28,813 --> 01:19:31,806
- He's in a rage.
- Surely, if I explain...

926
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:34,581
You know these aristocrats
with their points of honor.

927
01:19:35,855 --> 01:19:38,017
- Yes.
- Go back into the bank.

928
01:19:38,058 --> 01:19:39,719
I'll deal with Wenceslas.

929
01:19:39,793 --> 01:19:42,193
But what about Hortense?
I promised her.

930
01:19:42,229 --> 01:19:45,631
Give me the money...
without him seeing.

931
01:19:45,667 --> 01:19:48,660
And you'll give it to Hortense?
Of course. Brilliant.

932
01:20:08,729 --> 01:20:10,322
[Chorus singing]

933
01:20:17,341 --> 01:20:21,472
[Singing] The eulogy is droning,
you see a reddish glow

934
01:20:21,513 --> 01:20:25,450
You hear a dreadful groaning,
and down the hatch you go

935
01:20:26,252 --> 01:20:27,651
[Chorus singing]

936
01:20:34,395 --> 01:20:35,794
[Cheering and applause]

937
01:21:17,416 --> 01:21:18,940
I look good enough to eat.

938
01:21:25,025 --> 01:21:29,189
My dear, this is my cousin,
Count Wenceslas Steinbach.

939
01:21:29,230 --> 01:21:31,893
Yes, I recognize
Count Steinbach.

940
01:21:32,701 --> 01:21:35,193
I had the pleasure of being
present at your wedding.

941
01:21:36,272 --> 01:21:37,797
How good of you to come.

942
01:21:44,682 --> 01:21:46,947
JENNY: As I see the composition,

943
01:21:46,986 --> 01:21:50,684
Samson has awakened
with his hair shorn.

944
01:21:50,724 --> 01:21:52,248
Delilah is on her knees,

945
01:21:52,292 --> 01:21:55,387
Iooking adoringly
at the man she has destroyed.

946
01:21:55,463 --> 01:21:57,432
It is her power
that I would depict...

947
01:21:57,466 --> 01:22:00,867
her passion that brings
everything to destruction.

948
01:22:00,903 --> 01:22:03,498
No one has ever spoken
to me like this.

949
01:22:08,479 --> 01:22:10,641
Can we really have been
talking all night?

950
01:22:13,819 --> 01:22:16,117
But that's not
why we're here, is it?

951
01:22:17,024 --> 01:22:19,892
Mademoiselle Bette indicated
perhaps...

952
01:22:19,928 --> 01:22:22,021
I'm happy to loan you the money.

953
01:22:23,999 --> 01:22:27,265
- On one condition.
- Yes?

954
01:22:27,304 --> 01:22:29,606
You must create
my Samson and Delilah.

955
01:22:31,241 --> 01:22:35,269
Mademoiselle would perhaps do me
the honor of posing for Delilah.

956
01:22:40,353 --> 01:22:42,685
- I must go now.
- Mademoiselle, wait.

957
01:22:43,557 --> 01:22:46,024
- Don't leave.
- Oh, yes, your money.

958
01:22:46,059 --> 01:22:47,550
WENCESLAS:
I don't care about money!

959
01:23:03,581 --> 01:23:06,483
It isn't the money,
you understand.

960
01:23:06,518 --> 01:23:09,852
It's... the principle
of the thing.

961
01:23:09,889 --> 01:23:11,186
I understand.

962
01:23:11,224 --> 01:23:14,251
- Lf you don't pay us...
- I understand.

963
01:23:14,295 --> 01:23:18,392
...we will kill you
and your wife, your baby...

964
01:23:18,433 --> 01:23:20,368
and dump your bodies
in the Seine.

- I understand. I do.

[Plate shatters]

Come, come, dear. Things are
never as bad as they seem.

970
01:24:17,708 --> 01:24:21,941
Mademoiselle Cadine,
you are like the goddess Diana...

971
01:24:21,979 --> 01:24:24,039
fierce, yet tender.

972
01:24:24,083 --> 01:24:26,985
It breaks my heart.
They say that you are fickle...

973
01:24:27,020 --> 01:24:29,011
and out to conquer
every heart in Paris.

974
01:24:30,157 --> 01:24:33,615
I am an artist. I can look
into a block of marble...

975
01:24:33,694 --> 01:24:38,997
and see a tiger or a girl
with garlands in her hair...

976
01:24:40,203 --> 01:24:41,693
...and a moaning in her heart.

Which am I?

MAN: The public is waiting.
JENNY: Tell them I'm indisposed.

979
01:24:51,249 --> 01:24:53,480
Mademoiselle Cadine,
you cannot be indisposed.

980
01:24:53,519 --> 01:24:55,282
You have a performance
in ten minutes.

981
01:24:55,321 --> 01:24:58,052
In ten minutes,
I'll be with the man I love.

982
01:24:58,091 --> 01:25:01,323
You're too beautiful to be in
love with anyone but yourself.

If you're not on-stage

01:25:05,833 --> 01:25:08,803
- You're fired!
- Have you lost your wits?

986
01:25:08,837 --> 01:25:12,274
No, I've found them,
dear sister, all thanks to you.

987
01:25:13,244 --> 01:25:16,840
- You're talking nonsense.
- Is it nonsense? I think not.

988
01:25:16,882 --> 01:25:21,081
Wenceslas and I are in love.
Soon we'll be leaving Paris.

989
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:22,314
Leaving Paris?!

990
01:25:22,355 --> 01:25:24,916
Back to the country.
Back to Lorraine.

991
01:25:24,958 --> 01:25:26,358
I'll be a peasant again...

and long nights of love!

You a peasant! In those shoes?

994
01:25:33,570 --> 01:25:35,594
You couldn't survive a day
without Paris.

995
01:25:37,207 --> 01:25:39,540
You'll have no admirers,
no servants.

996
01:25:40,611 --> 01:25:43,775
- You can't even open a jar.
- I'll learn.

997
01:25:43,816 --> 01:25:45,785
We had an agreement.

998
01:25:45,819 --> 01:25:48,481
You were to steal Wenceslas
away from Hortense!

999
01:25:48,521 --> 01:25:49,682
And so I have.

1000
01:25:49,723 --> 01:25:52,020
But you weren't supposed
to fall in love!

1001
01:25:52,058 --> 01:25:53,321
Miraculous, isn't it?

1002
01:25:55,596 --> 01:25:56,962
Where are you going?

1003
01:25:56,998 --> 01:26:01,129
To the Rochet de Cancal, a night
of savage sex and dinner.

1004
01:26:01,170 --> 01:26:02,399
Farewell.

1005
01:26:02,439 --> 01:26:06,535
Remember Carribine... and what
happened after she retired.

1006

How will I recognize you when
I stumble over you in the park?

Your black velvet choker,
I think.

Is there no news of Wenceslas?
Have you spoken to Stidmann?

1010
01:26:54,637 --> 01:26:57,937
Has he seen him?
Where can he be?

He's never left me alone
for so long.

1012
01:27:00,711 --> 01:27:02,612

of that fat shrimp Crevel.

And now she expects me to drop
everything and run to her.

01:36:05,694 --> 01:36:08,720
No! I remember perfectly.

1099
01:36:08,797 --> 01:36:12,427
I went immediately to the bank.
I gave the money to your cousin.

1100
01:36:13,804 --> 01:36:15,999
- Where is it?
- Where is what?

1101
01:36:17,275 --> 01:36:20,301
- Where is it?
- What are you doing?

1102
01:36:20,345 --> 01:36:22,370
The pouch Crevel gave you!

1103
01:36:22,413 --> 01:36:24,814
It was intended for me,
and you kept it!

1104
01:36:24,850 --> 01:36:28,048
I want it. I want it! I want it!

1105
01:36:28,088 --> 01:36:29,350
But you have it.

1106
01:36:30,391 --> 01:36:33,588
I gave it to Wenceslas
that very day.

1107
01:36:33,628 --> 01:36:38,033
I went directly to his studio.
He was on his way to the park.

1108
01:36:38,067 --> 01:36:39,261
- The park?
- To meet you.

1109
01:36:39,335 --> 01:36:42,134
No. Not to meet me.

1110
01:36:43,842 --> 01:36:47,711
To meet her.
He's given it to her.

1111
01:36:47,747 --> 01:36:52,242
Oh, my dear.
The devil has a sister.

1112
01:36:53,654 --> 01:36:58,359
- How could he?
- For the sake of their pleasure.

1113
01:36:58,359 --> 01:37:01,796
Men commit
the most appalling crimes.

1114
01:37:03,365 --> 01:37:05,231
It's in their nature,
so it seems.

1115
01:37:08,271 --> 01:37:13,232
- Do you want him back?
- I don't want her to have him.

1116
01:37:20,654 --> 01:37:24,055
There's only one way to get
a tigress to drop her meat.

1117
01:37:30,766 --> 01:37:31,824
Father.

1118

[Kiss]

1119
01:37:51,793 --> 01:37:55,194
- My darling.
- Wenceslas.

1120
01:37:55,230 --> 01:37:56,960
Why aren't you dressed?

1121
01:37:57,033 --> 01:37:59,558
It took longer than
I thought it would to pack.

1122
01:37:59,635 --> 01:38:01,331
I have so many things.

1123
01:38:01,371 --> 01:38:03,305
None of which
you'll ever be needing again.

1124
01:38:03,340 --> 01:38:05,366
Still, I couldn't part
with any of it.

1125
01:38:05,410 --> 01:38:08,778
- Hurry, my love. Come.
- But I have to change, silly.

1126
01:38:08,814 --> 01:38:13,114
- I have a carriage waiting.
- I'm tired. I want a bath.

1127
01:38:13,152 --> 01:38:16,885
- There's no time.
- No, there isn't, is there?

1128
01:38:23,265 --> 01:38:24,699
Do you love me?

1129
01:38:26,168 --> 01:38:32,871
Yes. You're my first and only
love. I'll never know another.

1130
01:38:32,910 --> 01:38:35,243
Never know another?
I should say not.

1131
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:37,511
Kiss me. Hold me.

1132
01:38:39,752 --> 01:38:42,586
Jenny, if we don't leave now,
it will be too late.

1133
01:38:42,623 --> 01:38:45,058
- Please, Wenceslas...
- Why are you behaving so badly?

1134
01:38:47,429 --> 01:38:49,590
- It's just I've been thinking.
- Yes?

1135
01:38:50,934 --> 01:38:55,031
Well, why can't we stay
in Paris... just a little while?

1136
01:38:55,072 --> 01:38:56,903
- Stay?
- Yes.

1137
01:38:59,343 --> 01:39:01,608
JENNY: Where is Bette?
She should be here.

1138
01:39:01,680 --> 01:39:03,444
I need my slippers mended.

1139
01:39:03,483 --> 01:39:05,713
For God's sake, Jenny,
you don't need slippers.

1140
01:39:05,752 --> 01:39:08,950
Oh, but I do. I have
a performance in half an hour.

1141
01:39:10,025 --> 01:39:11,287
What are you saying?

1142
01:39:16,866 --> 01:39:18,128
I'm not leaving.

1143
01:39:19,903 --> 01:39:21,234
I'm not leaving Paris.

1144
01:39:23,174 --> 01:39:24,664
I've grown bored with you.

1145
01:39:26,177 --> 01:39:27,474
Is that plain enough?

1146
01:39:32,785 --> 01:39:36,313
Don't look at me like that.
It breaks my heart.

1147
01:39:38,593 --> 01:39:40,118
What heart, Mademoiselle?

1148
01:39:44,334 --> 01:39:46,929
- You'll have to go now.
- But we...

1149
01:39:52,978 --> 01:39:54,071
Go.

- No! No!

- Oh, Wenceslas!
- Wenceslas...

Madame Hortense Steinbach,

1156

you are hereby placed
under arrest...

1157
01:40:43,741 --> 01:40:46,233
for the murder of your husband,
Count Wenceslas Steinbach.

1158
01:40:47,846 --> 01:40:48,972
Cousin Bette!

1159
01:40:50,350 --> 01:40:54,481
My dear girl...
how shall I live without you?

1160
01:41:06,470 --> 01:41:10,965
No! No!

1161
01:41:20,187 --> 01:41:23,555
Life is so boring,
don't you think?

JENNY, SINGING:
Farewell, my friends

1164
01:41:36,607 --> 01:41:39,839
Who tread the paths of glory

1165
01:41:39,878 --> 01:41:43,815
Who, day and night,
are greeted by success

1166
01:41:44,884 --> 01:41:49,983
My artist friends,
I tell a simple story

1167
01:41:50,058 --> 01:41:54,325
And I abide
at a humble address

1168
01:41:55,097 --> 01:42:00,127
But then,
I need so little from existence

1169
01:42:00,171 --> 01:42:04,505
I've got my life,
a crust of bread to eat

1170
01:42:05,476 --> 01:42:10,575
My eyes are dry,
I gaze into the distance

1171

And sing a song of freedom
in the street

1172
