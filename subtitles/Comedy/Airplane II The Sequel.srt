Release

and unloading of passengers only.

00:01:36,481 --> 00:01:38,970
There is no stopping in the red zone.

00:01:40,424 --> 00:01:45,287
The white zone is for immediate loading
and unloading of passengers only.

5
00:01:45,636 --> 00:01:48,253
There is no stopping in the red zone.

6
00:01:50,621 --> 00:01:54,949
The white zone is for immediate loading
and unloading of passengers only.

7
00:01:55,342 --> 00:01:57,451
There is no stopping in
the red zone.

8
00:01:59,076 --> 00:02:03,700
The white zone is for immediate loading
and unloading of passengers only.

9
00:02:04,144 --> 00:02:06,840
There is no stopping
in the red zone.

10
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,088
Hello. Take this flower from the
Religious Consciousness Church.

11
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,934
- Would you care to make a donation?
- No, but thank you anyway.

12
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:23,016
The red zone is for immediate loading
and unloading of passengers only.

13
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,058
There's no stopping
in the white zone.

14
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,416
No. The white zone is for
loading and unloading.

15
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,378
There's no stopping in the red zone.

16
00:02:33,825 --> 00:02:36,214
The red zone's always been
for loading and unloading.

17
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,934
There's never stopping
in a white zone.

18
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:42,895
Don't tell me which zone's for stopping
and which is for loading.

19
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:46,575
Listen Betty, don't start up with
your white zone shit again.

20
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:53,009
Hello, take this flower from the
Religious Consciousness Church.

21
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,272
Would you like to make a donation?

22
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,794
No, thanks. We gave at the office.

23
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,672
Would you put all your metal objects
into this dish, please?

24
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,313
There's just no stopping
in a white zone.

25
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,277
Really Vernon, why pretend?

26
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,113
We both know what you're
talking about.

27
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,077
You want me to have an abortion.

28
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,550
It's the only sensible thing to do.
If it's done properly,

29
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,598
therapeutically, there's
no danger involved.

30
00:03:35,508 --> 00:03:36,283
Taxi!

31
00:03:44,909 --> 00:03:45,948
I'll be back in a minute.

32
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:57,419
Hello sir, take this flower from the
Religious Consciousness Church.

33
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,428
Would you care...

34
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,973
- Hey, Larry, where's the forklift?
- Forklift?

35
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,654
It's over there by the
baggage loader.

36
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,890
Look out!

37
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,814
- Elaine!
- Ted!

38
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,914
I came home early and
found your note.

39
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,788
I guess you meant for me to read it
later. I've got to talk to you.

40
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,235
I don't want to go over it any more.

41
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,288
Things haven't been right
for a long time,

42
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:55,452
but it'll be different, like it
was in the beginning.

43
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,496
Just be patient and I can
work things out.

44
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,572
I have been patient and
I've tried to help,

45
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,616
but you wouldn't even let me do that.

46
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,193
Don't you feel anything
for me any more?

47
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,478
It takes so many things
to make love last.

48
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,596
Most of all, it takes respect.

49
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,719
I can't live with a man I
don't respect.

50
00:05:24,977 --> 00:05:26,312
What a pisser.

51
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,313
Captain Oveur, white courtesy phone.

52
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,437
Captain Clarence Oveur,
white courtesy phone.

53
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,576
No, the white phone.

54
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,158
This is Captain Oveur.

55
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,232
One moment for your call
from the Mayo Clinic.

56
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,118
Captain Oveur, white courtesy phone,
Captain Clarence Oveur.

57
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,316
- I've got it.
- Thank you.

58
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,277
Go ahead with your call.

59
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,351
This is Dr. Brody at the Mayo Clinic.

60
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,908
There's a passenger on your
Chicago flight,

61
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,958
a little girl named Lisa Davis,
en route to Minneapolis.

62
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,349
She's scheduled for a
heart transplant.

63
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,546
Tell her mother we found a donor
a hour ago.

64
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,711
The heart is ready for surgery.

65
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,156
We must have the recipient on the
operating table within six hours.

66
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,550
Make sure she's kept in
a reclined position,

67
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,518
that a continuous watch
is kept on her IV.

68
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,830
Also, it's very important
she remain calm.

69
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,751
Excuse me, this is the operator.

70
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,799
I have an emergency call on line
five from Mr. Hamm.

71
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,416
Give me Hamm on five, hold the Mayo.

72
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,676
You'll be back tomorrow night.

73
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,716
We'll have dinner. We'll
talk things over.

74
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,156
I won't be back. I've requested
the Atlanta run.

75
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,038
Elaine... I promise I can change.

76
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,874
Then why didn't you take the job that
Louie Netz offered you at Boeing?

77
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:26,089
I haven't been able to get near
a plane since the war.

78
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,195
And they wouldn't hire me because
of my war record.

79
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,795
War record? You're the only one
keeping that alive.

80
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,030
For everyone else, it's
ancient history.

81
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,430
- You expect me to believe that?
- It's the truth.

82
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,478
What's hurt you the most is
your record since the war,

83
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,993
different cities, different jobs,

84
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,390
and not one of them shows you can
accept any real responsibility.

85
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,392
- Elaine, just give me one more...
- It's too late, Ted.

86
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,869
When I get back to Chicago,

87
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,037
I'm going to start my life all
over again. I'm sorry.

88
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,677
Excuse me, take this flower from
the Church of Religious...

89
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,316
Good evening.

90
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,468
There you go. Just follow them to
the back.

91
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:26,252
Any word on that storm lifting over
Salt Lake, Clarence?

92
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,774
No, not likely, Victor.

93
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:32,739
I just reviewed the area report
for 1600 hours through 2400.

94
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,698
There's an occluded front stalled
over the Dakotas,

95
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,577
backed up all the way to Utah.

96
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:41,414
If she decides to push over the Great
Lakes, it could get plenty soupy.

97
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,877
What about that southern route
around Tulsa?

98
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,315
I double-checked the terminal
forecast,

99
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,517
and the wind's aloft and IFR ceilings
all the way.

100
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,352
Where do they top out?

101
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,194
Light scattered cover at 20,000
icing around 18.

102
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:00,448
Looks like over Denver is best.

103
00:09:00,746 --> 00:09:01,778
Denver it is.

104
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,793
Sorry, Clarence.

105
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,151
Latest report shows everything's socked
in from Salt Lake to Lincoln.

106
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,912
Hi, Roger. Glad to have you aboard.

107
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,718
Victor, this is Roger Murdock.
Victor Basta.

108
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,950
- How do you do?
- Nice to meet you.

109
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,612
I was telling Victor
I reviewed the area report...

110
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,851
for 1600 hours through 2400.

111
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:23,031
There's an occluded front
stalled over the Dakotas.

112
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,871
There you go. Thank you.

113
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,998
Can you tell me if Elaine Dickinson
is on this flight?

114
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,530
The whole flight crew has boarded.
Let me see.

115
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,552
Oh, yes. She is on board.

116
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:51,195
I'd like one ticket to Chicago.
No baggage.

117
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,116
- Smoking or non-smoking?
- Smoking, please.

118
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,650
There. Have a nice trip.

119
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,899
Striker, this is Red Leader Four.

120
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:26,050
Primary target covered by fog.

121
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,631
Decision to proceed is yours.

122
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,917
The decision is yours...

123
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,673
is yours... is yours...

124
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,634
Golly, that white fellow
should stay away from my wife,

125
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,234
or I will punch him.

126
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,632
Yes, he is wrong for doing that.

127
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,734
I knew a man
in a similar predicament,

128
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,253
and he ended up being sorry.

129
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,490
Don't be naive, Arthur.

130
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:03,652
Each of us faces
a clear moral choice.

131
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:09,936
Early to bed, early to rise makes a
man healthy, wealthy and wise.

132
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,578
How true!

133
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,615
Golly!

134
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,892
Nervous?

135
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,777
Yes.

136
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,420
First time?

137
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,378
No. I've been nervous lots of times.

138
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,434
Hi. We'll be taking off real soon,
so I better fasten you in tight.

139
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,398
Thank you.
Oh Mother, this is so exciting!

140
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,778
I know but remember,
you must get some rest.

141
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:21,773
That's good advice. You relax, and
I'll be back after takeoff.

142
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,179
Thank you.

143
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:28,656
- I'm going to miss you so much.
- I'm going to miss you, too.

144
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,038
Promise you'll write?

145
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,156
Every day.

146
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,873
Bill!

147
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,076
Better get on board, son.

148
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,796
All aboard!

149
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,031
209er to ground control.
We're ready to taxi.

150
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:49,339
- Goodbye, Bill!
- Goodbye, darling!

151
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,217
I love you, darling!

152
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,234
209er, taxi to runway 19er.

153
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,352
Goodbye, darling!

154
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:02,410
Have your picture taken the minute
you get there and send me one.

155
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,536
OK here, hurry.

156
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,812
It's your watch, you shouldn't.
You're going to need this.

157
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,095
It's all right, it doesn't work.

158
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,011
- Bill!
- Goodbye, darling!

159
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,874
Bill!

160
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,550
Bill, Bill!
I'll keep it with me all the time.

161
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,949
Goodbye, darling.
Take care of yourself, goodbye.

162
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,229
- Flight 209er, clear for takeoff.
- Roger.

163
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,238
- LA departure frequency 1 23.9er.
- Roger.

164
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,149
- Request vector. Over.
- What?

165
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,435
Flight 209er, clear for vector 324.

166
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:39,215
- We have clearance, Clarence.
- Roger, Roger.

167
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,097
What's our vector, Victor?

168
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:45,014
- I want radio clearance. Over.
- That's Clarence Oveur. Over.

169
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,318
- Roger.
- Huh?

170
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,153
- Roger. Over.
- Huh? Who?

171
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,910
Do you feel all right, sir?

172
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,936
Oh, I haven't flown for a long time.

173
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,910
Good evening. This is Captain Oveur speaking.

174
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,072
We'll be cruising at 36,000 feet
this evening...

175
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,216
Relax and enjoy your flight.

176
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,336
Would you like something to read?

177
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,411
Do you have anything light?

178
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:59,133
How about this leaflet,
''Famous Jewish Sports Legends''?

179
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,097
Yes. Thank you.

180
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,037
- Ted! What are you doing here?
- Elaine, I've got to talk to you.

181
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,588
You shouldn't have come.
I don't have time now.

182
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,136
- Stewardess?
- Excuse me.

183
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,209
But...

184
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:28,753
No wonder you're upset. She's lovely.

185
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,439
And a darling figure.

186
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:37,991
Supple, pouting breasts, firm thighs.

187
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,238
It's a shame you two
don't get along.

188
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,276
Yes, I know.

189
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,816
Things used to be different.

190
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,959
I remember when we first met.

191
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,773
It was during the war.

192
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,252
I was in the air force,

193
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:01,855
stationed in Drambuie, off
the Barbary Coast.

194
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,795
I used to hang out at the
Magumba Bar.

195
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,589
It was a rough place. The seediest
dive on the wharf,

196
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:13,435
populated with every reject and cut-throat
from Bombay to Calcutta.

197
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,397
It was worse than Detroit.

198
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,331
The mood in the place was down ugly.

199
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:31,856
You wouldn't be there unless you
knew how to use your fists.

200
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,454
A fight broke out almost every night.

201
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:48,009
I didn't go there that night
to fall in love.

202
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,130
I just wanted a couple of drinks.

203
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,051
And suddenly, there she was.

204
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:05,253
I was captivated, entranced. It
hit me like a thunderbolt.

205
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:09,697
I had to asked this guy to pinch me
to make sure I wasn't dreaming.

206
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,796
I was afraid to approach her,

207
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,519
but that night, fate was on my side.

208
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:30,416
We laughed, we talked, we danced.

209
00:21:30,637 --> 00:21:33,285
I never wanted it to end.
I guess I still don't.

210
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,867
But enough about me. I hope this
hasn't been boring for you.

211
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,973
Whenever I talk about
Elaine I always...

212
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,607
get so carried away.

213
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,437
I lose all track of time.

214
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,636
Would you like to order dinner now?

215
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,518
Joey will have steak and my
wife and I will have fish.

216
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,477
When can I see the cockpit, Dad?

217
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:56,314
The pilots are probably too busy
flying the plane for that.

218
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,958
Aw, gee whizz!

219
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:01,396
I'll talk to the captain and
see what I can arrange.

220
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,630
Gee, that'd be swell!

221
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,616
Would you care to order your dinners?

222
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:12,090
l would like the steak, please.

223
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,689
l'll have the fish.

224
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,938
Excuse me, I happened to be passing.

225
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,409
I thought you might like some coffee.

226
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,094
That's very nice of you. Thank you.

227
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,752
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.

228
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,334
- Cream?
- No thank you, I take it black.

229
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,717
Like my men.

230
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,236
Oh Ted, I never knew
I could be so happy.

231
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,517
These past few months have
been just wonderful.

232
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,276
Tomorrow, why don't we drive to
that little seafood place and...

233
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:12,353
- What's the matter?
- My orders came through.

234
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,817
My squadron ships out tomorrow.

235
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:18,256
We're bombing the storage depots
at Daiquiri at 1800 hours.

236
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,695
We're coming in
from the north, below their radar.

237
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,532
When will you be back?

238
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:26,817
I can't tell you that,
it's classified.

239
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:31,916
Oh Ted, please be careful.
I worry about you so much.

240
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,889
I love you, Elaine.

241
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,971
I love you.

242
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:01,909
Flight 209er,
this is Denver flight control.

243
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,991
You're approaching rough weather.

244
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,435
Please climb to 42,000 feet.

245
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,437
- Roger, Denver.
- We have a visitor.

246
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,009
Hello.

247
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:16,252
Captain Oveur, Mr. Murdock,
and Mr. Basta, this is Joey Hammen.

248
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,910
- Hi, Joey.
- Come up here.

249
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,879
This is for special visitors.
Would you like to have it?

250
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,317
- Thank you. Thanks a lot.
- Sure. Ever been in a cockpit before?

251
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,198
No, I've never been up
in a plane before.

252
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:33,419
Have you ever seen a grown man naked?

253
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:37,493
- Shall I check the weather?
- No, why don't you take care of it?

254
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:41,368
Joey, do you ever hang around
a gymnasium?

255
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:44,816
- We'd better get back.
- No, Joey can stay for a while.

256
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,653
- Could I?
- OK, if you don't get in the way.

257
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:51,449
Flight 209er to Denver,
climbing to cruise at 42,000.

258
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:55,691
Will report again over Lincoln.
Over and out.

259
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:59,568
Wait a minute, l know you.
You're Kareem Abdul Jabbar.

260
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:03,152
You play basketball
for the Los Angeles Lakers.

261
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,596
Sorry, you have me confused
with someone else.

262
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,831
My name's Roger Murdock.
I'm the co-pilot.

263
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:13,629
You are Kareem, I've seen you play.
My Dad's got season tickets.

264
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,837
You should go back to your seat now.
Right, Clarence?

265
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,872
No, he's not bothering anyone.
Let him stay here.

266
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:26,328
All right, but just remember
my name is Roger Murdock.

267
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,092
I'm an airline pilot.

268
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:30,136
I think you're the greatest,

269
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:33,189
but my dad says you don't work hard
enough on defence.

270
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:38,175
And he says lots of times
you don't even run downcourt.

271
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,877
And you don't try,
except during play-offs.

272
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:43,601
The hell I don't!

273
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:49,608
Listen kid, I've been hearing
that crap ever since I was at UCLA.

274
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:53,056
I'm out there busting my buns
every night.

275
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,938
Tell your old man
to drag Walton and Lanier...

276
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:58,250
up and down the court for 48 minutes.

277
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,333
Joey...

278
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,956
Do you like movies about gladiators?

279
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,938
Elaine, just hear me out.

280
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,720
Things haven't been right
for a long time,

281
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:23,839
but it'll be different,
like in the beginning, remember?

282
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,994
I remember everything.

283
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,221
All I have is memories.

284
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,792
Mostly, I remember the nights
we were together.

285
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,156
I remember how you used to hold me,

286
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,471
and how I used to sit on your face
and wriggle, and...

287
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:43,189
afterwards, how we'd watch
till the sun came up.

288
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,477
When it did, it was almost like...

289
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:51,994
like each new day was
created only for us.

290
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:55,059
That's the way
I've always wanted it to be.

291
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,131
But it won't be.

292
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:00,974
Not as long as you insist
on living in the past!

293
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,710
You're too low, Ted! You're too low!

294
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,352
The mind plays tricks on you.

295
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:31,391
He looks so happy today, doesn't he?

296
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,436
You look so happy today.

297
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,508
OK Robert, slip them down.
This won't hurt much.

298
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,520
You got a telegram
from headquarters today.

299
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,636
Headquarters? What is it?

300
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:47,156
A big building where generals meet,
but that's not important.

301
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50,949
They've cleared you of any blame
for what happened on that raid.

302
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,713
- Isn't that good news?
- Is it?

303
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:58,510
Because of my mistake,
six men didn't return from that raid.

304
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,558
Seven. Lieutenant Zip died
this morning.

305
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:05,849
But Dr. Sandler says you'll be out
in a week. Isn't that wonderful?

306
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:10,813
I wish I could say the same
for George Zip.

307
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:15,655
Be patient, Ted. Nobody expects you
to get over this immediately.

308
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:19,494
Hey Striker, how about a break?
I'm getting tired.

309
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,616
Yeah, all right. Take five.

310
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,574
Thanks.

311
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:29,295
I found a wonderful apartment for us.

312
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:31,336
It has a brick fireplace...

313
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:34,651
and a cute bedroom with
mirrors on the ceiling and...

314
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,573
Red Leader!
Red Leader, I'm going down!

315
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:42,097
Captain Geline. He think he's
a pilot, still fighting the war.

316
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:45,979
I've found the tunnel, Johnson!
It's this way!

317
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:48,813
$25 for a cigarette is too much!

318
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,916
- What's his problem?
- It's Lieutenant Hurwitz.

319
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,036
Severe shell shock.

320
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,156
He thinks he's Ethel Merman.

321
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,235
War is hell.

322
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,558
Excuse me, sir. Would you
like coffee before dinner?

323
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:32,370
No. No, thank you.

324
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:37,689
- Would you like another cup?
- I will, but Jim won't.

325
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:40,667
I think I will have another
cup of coffee.

326
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:45,671
Jim never has a second
cup of coffee at home.

327
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,034
- Excuse me, sister.
- Yes?

328
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,475
There's a little girl
onboard who's ill.

329
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:00,233
Oh, yes, I saw. Poor child.

330
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:04,199
Could l borrow your guitar?
I thought maybe I could cheer her up.

331
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,669
- Of course.
- Thank you.

332
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,917
- Hi.
- Hi.

333
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,719
Do you mind if I talk
to your daughter?

334
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,549
I think that'd would be nice.

335
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,519
- Hi, I'm Randy.
- I'm Lisa.

336
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,319
Oh, you have a guitar.

337
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,358
I thought maybe you'd
like to hear a song.

338
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,953
I'd love to.

339
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,679
OK. Let's see...

340
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,751
This is one of my favorites.

341
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,856
You're late. We've been waiting.

342
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:10,090
- Who's first?
- Go ahead, Clarence.

343
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:12,136
How's the weather?

344
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:14,176
We got some heavy stuff ahead.

345
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,091
We've got to climb on top.

346
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:21,853
Yeah, after the war, I wanted
to get as far away as possible,

347
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:25,649
so Elaine and I joined
the Peace Corps.

348
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:30,177
We were assigned
to an isolated tribe, the Molombos.

349
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:33,058
They'd never seen Americans before.

350
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:49,336
It was really a challenge,

351
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,541
introducing them
to our western culture.

352
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,679
At first, they didn't know
what to think of us.

353
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,830
But soon, we gained their trust.

354
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:13,596
It'll help you better
prepare storing foods

355
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:17,331
for the up and coming
monsoon months.

356
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:22,130
Also, Supperware products are
ideal for storing leftovers...

357
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:24,893
to help stretch your food dollar.

358
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:29,189
This two-quart
''Seals-M-Rite'' container...

359
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,874
keeps hot dog buns fresh for days.

360
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:36,612
These people had been completely
isolated from civilization.

361
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:40,375
No one had outlined a physical
fitness program for them,

362
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,257
and they had no athletic equipment.

363
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:44,217
I started them
on simple calisthenics,

364
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,938
worked up to rudimentary game skills,

365
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,353
and finally,
advanced competitive theory.

366
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,591
I was patient,
and they were eager to learn.

367
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:54,898
They seemed to enjoy themselves.

368
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:58,256
Probably due to advanced
American teaching techniques,

369
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:01,138
we bridged the generations
of isolation,

370
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:03,780
and communicated successfully
with the Molombos.

371
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,197
They're getting the hang of it.

372
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,236
When we re-enlist,
I'll teach them baseball.

373
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:17,539
Ted, I don't want to stay here.

374
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:21,818
It's time to go home
to the plans we made before the war.

375
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:27,818
A lot of people made plans
before the war. Like George Zip.

376
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:37,950
At that moment, I realised Elaine
had doubts about our relationship.

377
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:41,999
And that, as much as anything else,
led to my drinking problem.

378
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:46,959
We did come back to the States.
I tried a number of jobs.

379
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,237
I could go on,
but I'd probably bore you.

380
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,959
I couldn't blame Elaine.
She wanted a career.

381
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,399
- I can't stand it.
- What is it?

382
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,471
- Yes?
- It's my stomach.

383
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,712
I haven't felt this awful
since we saw that Ronald Reagan film.

384
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,482
I'll see if I can find
some Dramamine.

385
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,233
Captain, a woman passenger
is very sick.

386
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,799
Airsick?

387
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,952
I think so, but I've
never seen it so acute.

388
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:33,573
Find out if a doctor's onboard
as quietly as you can.

389
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:41,598
Joey, have you ever been
in a Turkish prison?

390
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,161
I shouldn't have had that
second cup of coffee.

391
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,425
Jim never vomits at home.

392
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,072
Sorry to wake you, I'm
looking for a doctor.

393
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,832
There's nothing to worry about.

394
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:10,674
Stewardess, I think the man
next to me is a doctor.

395
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:14,355
Sir, excuse me. Sorry to wake you,
are you a doctor?

396
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,591
- That's right.
- We have sick passengers.

397
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,654
- Could you come look at them?
- Yes, of course.

398
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,642
Let me see your tongue.

399
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,185
I'll be back in a minute.

400
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:14,299
Tell the captain to land.
She must go to a hospital.

401
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,371
A hospital? What is it?

402
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,418
It's a big building with patients, but
that's not important right now.

403
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,860
- I must speak to the captain.
- Certainly.

404
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,276
Victor, we're running into heavy...

405
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,976
Roger, take over!

406
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:59,891
- Captain, how soon can you land?
- I can't tell.

407
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:03,097
- You can tell me. I'm a doctor.
- No, I'm not sure.

408
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:07,285
- Can't you take a guess?
- Not for another two hours.

409
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:11,272
You can't take a guess
for another two hours?

410
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,796
No, we can't land.
Fog has closed down everything.

411
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,950
We've got to get through to Chicago.

412
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,871
Get him out of there!

413
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,476
What is it, Doctor? What's going on?

414
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:56,449
I'm not sure. Haven't
seen anything like this...

415
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:58,496
since the Anita Bryant Concert.

416
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:03,096
- What did we have for dinner?
- We had a choice, steak or fish.

417
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:07,058
Yes, I remember. I had Lasagna.

418
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:09,449
- What did he have?
- He had fish.

419
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:13,579
Doctor, two more are sick.
The other passengers are worried.

420
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,616
We'll handle the passengers.

421
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,732
Find out what the sick people
had for dinner.

422
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,798
This is Captain Oveur speaking.

423
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,784
It's bumpy, but we'll be past it
in a few minutes.

424
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,117
We're now flying over Hoover Dam,

425
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,590
and later we'll pass south
of the Grand Canyon.

426
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,114
Meanwhile, relax
and enjoy your flight, OK?

427
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,952
Chicago, this is flight 209er.
We're in trouble.

428
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:42,496
We need traffic below us cleared...

429
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,855
and priority landing in Chicago.

430
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,435
Yes?

431
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:54,269
My husband's very sick.
Can you do something?

432
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,016
The doctor will be with you
in just a moment.

433
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:59,171
One thing, do you know what he
had for dinner?

434
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:01,376
Yes, we both had fish. Why?

435
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,735
It's nothing to be alarmed about.

436
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,856
We'll be back to you very quickly.

437
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,073
Doctor, Mr. Hammen ate fish,

438
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:18,948
and Randy said there are five
more cases, and they all had fish.

439
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:22,498
The co-pilot had fish.
What did the navigator have?

440
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,172
He had fish.

441
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:27,877
All right, now we know
what we're up against.

442
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:32,750
Those who had fish for dinner
will soon become violently ill.

443
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:37,253
- Just how serious is it?
- Extremely serious.

444
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:40,730
It starts with a slight fever,
dryness of the throat.

445
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:43,539
When the virus penetrates,
the victim becomes dizzy,

446
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:46,771
and begins to experience
an itching rash.

447
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:50,216
From there, the poison works
on the central nervous system,

448
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,131
causing severe muscle spasms,

449
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:54,097
followed by the inevitable drooling.

450
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:56,569
At this point,
the digestive system collapses,

451
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,833
accompanied
by uncontrollable flatulence.

452
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,695
Until finally, the
poor bastard is reduced...

453
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:04,710
to a quivering, wasted
piece of jelly.

454
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,072
Put it on automatic pilot.

455
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,870
Automatic pilot, automatic pilot...
there it is!

456
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,248
I'll go back to the passengers.

457
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,571
Come in, 209er. This is Chicago.

458
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,618
Flight 209er, come in.

459
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:54,474
This is Elaine Dickinson,
the stewardess.

460
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,471
Captain Oveur's passed out.

461
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,950
We've lost the co-pilot
and navigator, too. We're in trouble.

462
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:03,191
Roger. I'm Steve McCroskey,
Chicago air control.

463
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,909
I'll be back in a moment.
Hold all takeoffs.

464
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,560
When 508 reports,
bring it straight in.

465
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:13,394
Suspend all meal service
on flights leaving Los Angeles.

466
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:16,153
Tell all dispatchers
to remain at the post.

467
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:18,412
- How about coffee?
- No, thanks.

468
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,231
I want the weather
on every available landing field.

469
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,958
You understand?

470
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:27,316
Any place available
to land that plane!

471
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:31,109
Go to the tower
and get a runway diagram.

472
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,774
Check down the field
for emergency equipment.

473
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,552
Chief, we got fog every place
east of the Rockies.

474
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:42,189
They'll have
to come through to Chicago.

475
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:45,352
Looks like I picked the wrong week
to quit smoking.

476
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:49,831
Get the best available man
who won't crack under pressure.

477
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,309
How about Mr. Rogers?

478
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:58,770
Get me Rex Kramer.

479
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:07,469
Next to the throttle
is the air speed gauge.

480
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:10,518
What speed does it indicate?

481
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:15,616
- 520 miles per hour.
- Good. Very good.

482
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:18,089
Now, check your altitude.

483
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:21,570
That's the dial below and right
of the speed indicator.

484
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:24,652
35,000 feet.

485
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:27,538
No, wait. 34,000 feet.

486
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:30,976
No. It's dropping,
it's dropping fast.

487
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:34,120
Why is it doing that?

488
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:40,399
Oh, my God! The automatic pilot,
it's deflating!

489
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,755
Elaine, don't panic.

490
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:46,173
On his belt line
there's a hollow tube.

491
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:48,694
That's the manual inflation nozzle.

492
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:51,214
Pull it out and blow on it.

493
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,056
What the hell's going on up there?

494
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,633
- Elaine.
- Yes, Doctor?

495
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,716
Elaine, you're a member of this crew.

496
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,268
- Can you face some unpleasant facts?
- No.

497
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:06,875
Unless we hospitalise
those people quickly,

498
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,758
I can't be sure
of saving their lives.

499
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,829
Is there anyone on board
who can land this plane?

500
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,677
Well...

501
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,712
No one I know of.

502
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:24,033
You ought to know our chances.
Our lives depend on just one thing...

503
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:30,014
finding someone to fly this plane
who didn't have fish for dinner.

504
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:44,914
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your stewardess speaking.

505
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:49,413
We regret any inconvenience
the sudden cabin movement caused.

506
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:53,095
This is due to periodic air pockets.

507
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:57,492
There's no reason to become alarmed.
We hope you enjoy your flight.

508
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:03,176
By the way, is there anyone
on board who can fly a plane?

509
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,032
Hello. I'm Paul Carey
from the airline.

510
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:37,475
- I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.
- Yes. Come in, Paul.

511
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,596
Rex will be right out.

512
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:44,360
Shep, sit. Sit!

513
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:47,079
So I understand there's an emergency.

514
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:51,438
Something like that. There wasn't
time to tell me very much...

515
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,597
Shep, no!

516
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,877
I'll bet exciting things
happen all the time down there.

517
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,394
Airline business
does have its moments.

518
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,994
After a while, you get used to it.

519
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:07,437
Shep! Come!

520
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:12,316
He gets so excited
when new people are here.

521
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,358
- Are you a pilot?
- No, I'm in...

522
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,715
a training program.

523
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:21,497
It's unbelievable.
It's just unbelievable.

524
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:25,470
How many times have I warned
about food inspection?

525
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:28,313
You'd think
someone would listen to you.

526
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,955
Well, airport management,
the FAA, and the airlines...

527
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:35,895
they're all cheats and liars.

528
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,682
All right. Let's get out of here.

529
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,404
I'm sorry, I was just looking
for someone with flying experience.

530
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:55,074
When they built those roads,
they didn't think about drainage,

531
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:58,225
so we had to take a special jeep
up to the main road.

532
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,031
We were lucky to get a jeep,

533
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:06,916
since, just the day before,
only one we had broke down.

534
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:07,833
It had a bad axle...

535
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:09,718
Excuse me, sir.
There's a problem in the cockpit.

536
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,631
The cockpit? What is it?

537
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,917
The little room where the pilot sits.
That's not important.

538
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,592
The first officer is ill,

539
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,717
and the captain needs someone
to help him with the radio.

540
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,189
Do you know anything about planes?

541
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:27,113
I flew in the war years ago.

542
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:29,965
I wouldn't know anything about it.

543
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:32,896
Would you go up, please?

544
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,272
The stewardess said...

545
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:57,029
- Both pilots?
- Can you fly this plane and land it?

546
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,395
Surely, you can't be serious.

547
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,674
I am serious,
and don't call me Shirley.

548
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:06,290
Doctor, I've checked everyone.
Mr. Striker's the only one.

549
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,592
What's your flying experience?

550
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:12,687
I flew single-engine fighters,
but this plane has four engines.

551
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,518
It's an entirely different
kind of flying altogether.

552
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:18,717
It's an entirely different
kind of flying.

553
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,872
I haven't touched
any kind of plane in six years.

554
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:27,191
Mr. Striker,
I know nothing about flying.

555
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:32,376
You're the only one on this plane
who can possibly fly it.

556
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:35,020
You're the only chance we've got.

557
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:20,053
That's right. That's what I said.
You heard me.

558
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:22,096
Tell Omaha to acknowledge
and stand by.

559
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:25,200
Every piece
of emergency equipment available.

560
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:29,538
Alert rescue units every mile
of the way, from here to the Rockies.

561
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:30,212
Chief!

562
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:35,112
We'll need
a free-landing flight check. Fast.

563
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,316
- It's your wife.
- I want the kids in bed by nine,

564
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,550
the dog fed, the yard watered,
the gate locked.

565
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:41,750
Get a note to the milkman -
''No more cheese.''

566
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:46,048
Where the hell is Kramer?

567
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:58,417
No, he can't do that.
The risk of a flame-out's too great.

568
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:02,217
Keep him at 24,000... no, feet.

569
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:08,894
A passenger is going
to land that plane.

570
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:11,972
- Is that possible?
- It's a hundred to one shot.

571
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:19,210
- I know this guy.
- You do? Who is it?

572
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:21,973
Ted striker.
I flew with him during the war.

573
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:24,674
It won't make my job easier.

574
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:28,817
Ted Striker was a crack
flight leader.

575
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:34,133
He was one of those men who...
felt too much inside.

576
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,711
Maybe you know that kind.

577
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,385
He went all to pieces
on a particular mission.

578
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:43,452
Let's just hope
that doesn't happen tonight.

579
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:55,633
Let's see... altitude 24,000 feet.

580
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:00,150
Level flight. Speed, 520 knots.

581
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:02,544
Course Zero Niner Zero.

582
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:07,169
Trim, mixture.
Wash, soap, rinse, spin.

583
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:15,198
Ted, what are you doing here?
You can't fly this plane.

584
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,316
That's what I'm trying to tell them.

585
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:21,632
Elaine. I don't have time to be
gentle, so I'll be very direct.

586
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:24,154
Everyone is in a desperate situation.

587
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:27,471
Mr. Striker is the only hope we got.

588
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,715
Those are the flaps.
This is the thrust.

589
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,288
This must turn on the landing lights.

590
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:57,190
- Mayday, Mayday!
- Mayday? What the hell is that?

591
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:01,189
May Day's the Russian new year.
We'll have a big parade and serve...

592
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:14,450
I can't stand it any more.

593
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:15,432
I've got to get out of here!

594
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,871
Calm down! Get a hold of yourself!

595
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,918
- Please let me handle this.
- I've got to get out...

596
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:26,676
Calm down, get to your seat.
I'll take it.

597
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,671
Calm down. Get ahold of yourself.

598
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:30,990
Doctor, you're wanted on the phone.

599
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:34,310
Everything will be all right.

600
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:37,432
- Sister, I can handle this.
- Got to get out of here!

601
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:44,894
Excuse me, we'd like you to have
this flower.

602
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:48,298
Excuse me sir, would you...

603
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,612
Donations for Reverend Moon?

604
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:53,352
Jews for Jesus?

605
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:55,460
Read about Jehovah's Witness?

606
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:58,300
How about Buddhism?

607
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:01,068
Help Jerry's kids?

608
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,252
- Scientology?
- For nuclear power?

609
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:15,708
Your attention, please.
No-frills passengers now arriving.

610
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:19,679
Please have your baggage
claim checks ready to show

611
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:21,910
upon leaving the terminal.

612
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:25,412
This guy has no airline experience.

613
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:28,253
He's a menace
to everything in the air.

614
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:30,092
Yes, birds, too.

615
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:33,536
OK, he's a terrible risk,
but what other choice have we got?

616
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:36,719
That's the whole story, Rex.
Everything we know.

617
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:39,990
Let's face a few facts.

618
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:43,219
I flew with Striker during the war.

619
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:47,293
He can't afford to worry about those
times when things weren't so good.

620
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:51,453
- Right now things aren't so good.
- Let me tell you something.

621
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:54,577
Striker was a top-notch
squadron leader long ago.

622
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:58,776
Get on the horn
and talk that guy down.

623
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:02,438
Let him get the feel
of that airplane,

624
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:06,523
then you'll have to talk him
right down to the ground.

625
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,913
Very well.
Put Striker on the speaker.

626
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,180
Use my radio.

627
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,169
I took the wrong week
to quit drinking.

628
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:22,146
You can work them direct
from here, Captain.

629
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:30,068
Striker? Striker, this is
Captain Rex Kramer speaking.

630
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:37,468
Yes, Captain Kramer.
Read you loud and clear.

631
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:42,938
All right. It's obvious
you remember me.

632
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:48,065
What do you say we forget about
everything, except what we must do?

633
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:50,456
Let's not kid each other, Kramer.

634
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:53,878
You know I've never flown
a bucket like this.

635
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:56,753
- I'll need all the luck there is.
- Stand by, Striker.

636
00:56:57,900 --> 00:57:02,735
Our one hope is to build this man up.
I've got to give him confidence.

637
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:06,256
Striker, you ever flown
a multi-engine plane?

638
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:10,137
- No, never.
- Shit! It's a goddamn waste of time.

639
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,704
There's no way he can land
this plane.

640
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:14,854
You got to talk him down! You got to!

641
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:18,250
Route him into Lake Michigan. At
least avoid killing innocent people.

642
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:20,111
You're the only chance they've got.

643
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:23,295
All right.

644
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:27,686
Striker, you listen,
and you listen close.

645
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,195
Flying a plane is no different than
riding a bicycle.

646
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:34,588
It's just harder
to put baseball cards in the spokes.

647
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,797
First, get the feel of the plane.

648
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:39,607
Later, we'll run down
the landing procedure.

649
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:47,293
All right.
Disengage the automatic pilot.

650
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:51,718
Make no violent control movements
like you did in the fighter planes.

651
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:54,758
All right.
I'll unlock the automatic pilot.

652
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:04,395
The controls will feel very heavy
compared to a fighter.

653
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:09,738
Don't worry about that.
It's perfectly normal.

654
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:23,127
Now, one more thing.

655
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:26,360
Can somebody work the radio
and leave you free for flying?

656
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:29,077
The stewardess is here with me.

657
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:31,988
Good. Have her sit
in the co-pilot seat.

658
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:36,448
Elaine, he wants you
to sit in the co-pilot seat.

659
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:48,135
What's going on?
We have a right to know the truth.

660
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:52,036
All right, I'll level with you all.

661
00:58:52,620 --> 00:58:55,303
The most important thing
is that you remain calm.

662
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:57,856
There's no reason to panic.

663
00:58:57,940 --> 00:59:00,631
It's true one of the
crew members is ill.

664
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:02,473
Slightly ill.

665
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:05,814
The other two pilots are just fine.

666
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:07,731
They're flying the plane,

667
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:10,595
free to pursue
a life of religious fulfilment.

668
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:15,207
The radio is all yours. Keep an eye
on number three engine gauge.

669
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:17,110
It's running a little hot.

670
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:23,364
Striker, first I'd like
to say something.

671
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:26,861
I know things must look
pretty rough up there.

672
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:30,333
If you do what I tell you
when I tell you,

673
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:33,059
there's no reason you should
lack confidence...

674
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:36,655
in your chances of coming out
alive and in one piece.

675
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,549
What weather are you in?

676
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:42,916
- Rain.
- And a little ice.

677
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,638
And a little ice.

678
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:50,272
- How's it handling?
- Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.

679
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:53,169
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.

680
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,457
All right, Striker.
You're doing just fine.

681
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:00,699
It's damn good he doesn't
know I hate his guts.

682
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:04,642
It's damn good you don't know
he hates your guts.

683
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:13,171
Can I get you something?

684
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,717
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

685
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:26,277
- Stewardess, I speak jive.
- Good.

686
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:28,771
He said he's in great pain,

687
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:31,818
and he wants to know
if you can help him?

688
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:36,098
Tell him to relax.
I'll be back with some medicine.

689
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:08,539
Call Captain Oveur's wife
and let her know what's going on.

690
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:10,497
This weather bulletin
just came off the wire.

691
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:15,513
Johnny, what can you make out of this?

692
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:20,078
This? I can make a hat
or a brooch or pterodactyl...

693
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:32,530
- Hello?
- Mrs. Oveur?

694
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:34,417
Yes, this is Mrs. Oveur.

695
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,389
This is Ed Macias
calling from the airport.

696
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:39,710
There's trouble
on your husband's flight.

697
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:41,756
We don't know how serious it is,

698
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:45,196
but Steve McCroskey thought you'd
want to come over right away.

699
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:47,156
Yes. I'll be right down.

700
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:52,916
I've got to go to the airport.

701
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,434
You can let yourself
out the back door.

702
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:57,476
There's juice in the refrigerator.

703
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:09,438
Doctor says the sick people
are getting worse.

704
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:10,891
We're running out of time.

705
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:14,912
I've got to concentrate.

706
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:18,791
I've got to concentrate.

707
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:22,352
Hello?

708
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:26,858
Echo!

709
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:31,590
Pinch hitting for Pedro Bourbone,

710
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:33,636
Manny Mota.

711
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:40,789
- How you doing, honey?
- Jack, I'm so hot, I'm burning up.

712
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:42,871
I'll turn on some air.

713
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:51,796
- What's going on?
- Close the window!

714
01:02:53,380 --> 01:02:55,735
Chicago,
the passengers are panicking.

715
01:02:55,820 --> 01:02:57,165
When do we start down?

716
01:02:58,060 --> 01:03:01,379
Not yet. You'll be in radar range
any second now.

717
01:03:02,140 --> 01:03:04,586
They should have been in range
10 minutes ago.

718
01:03:05,780 --> 01:03:07,935
Gunderson, check the radar range.
Anything yet?

719
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:11,537
About two more minutes, chief.

720
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:18,690
Two minutes?
They could be miles off course.

721
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:20,452
Impossible! They're on instruments.

722
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:26,168
This is going to be a real sweat.

723
01:03:26,980 --> 01:03:29,422
Gunderson,
let me know when you get anything.

724
01:03:29,740 --> 01:03:31,332
Got a cigarette, Nels?

725
01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:32,884
I can't take much more of this.

726
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:39,753
Looks like I picked the wrong week
to quit amphetamines.

727
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:43,896
- Johnny, how about some more coffee?
- No, thanks.

728
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:46,133
These reporters want a statement.

729
01:03:46,540 --> 01:03:50,215
- How much longer can they hold out?
- 30, 45 minutes.

730
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:53,019
- Who's flying the plane?
- A passenger.

731
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:56,331
He's an experienced air force pilot.
No cause for alarm.

732
01:03:56,420 --> 01:03:58,536
- Take over.
- What kind of plane?

733
01:03:58,620 --> 01:04:01,009
It's a big, pretty white plane...

734
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:04,012
with red stripes and
curtains in the window...

735
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:06,056
and wheels... it looks like a big Tylenol.

736
01:04:07,384 --> 01:04:09,132
OK boys. Let's get some pictures.

737
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:41,318
This bulletin just handed to me.

738
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:43,311
Stricken airliner
approaching Chicago...

739
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,594
Shana, they bought their tickets.

740
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:02,704
They knew what
they were getting into.

741
01:05:04,523 --> 01:05:06,985
I say, let them crash!

742
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:25,591
- Would you like some whisky, ma'am?
- Certainly not!

743
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:40,191
How are the passengers?

744
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:43,238
I won't deceive you, Mr. Striker.
We're running out of time.

745
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:46,113
Surely, there's something you can do.

746
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:47,220
I'm doing everything I can...

747
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:49,936
and stop calling me Shirley.

748
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:16,680
Randy, are you all right?

749
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:19,695
Oh, Dr. Rumack.

750
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:22,166
I'm scared.

751
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:24,368
I've never been so scared.

752
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:28,553
And besides,
I'm 26 and I'm not married.

753
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:32,006
We're going to make it.
You've got to believe that.

754
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:35,837
Dr. Rumack, do you have any idea
when we'll be landing?

755
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:37,876
Pretty soon. How are you bearing up?

756
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:41,452
To be honest,
I've never been so scared,

757
01:06:42,105 --> 01:06:43,663
but at least I have a husband.

758
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:00,556
Stay in formation.
Target's just ahead.

759
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:03,868
Target should be clear
if you go in low enough.

760
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:07,592
You'll have to decide.
You'll have to decide.

761
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:09,289
You'll have to decide.

762
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:13,669
Stay in formation.
Target's just ahead.

763
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:17,103
Target should be clear
if you go in low enough.

764
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:20,398
You'll have to decide.
You'll have to decide.

765
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:22,174
You'll have to decide.

766
01:07:27,260 --> 01:07:31,014
Oh, rats! Lost number four.

767
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:33,455
What happened? What went wrong?

768
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:36,418
The oil pressure, I forgot to check
the oil pressure.

769
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:40,754
When Kramer hears about this,
the shit's going to hit the fan.

770
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:46,437
I told him to watch that
oil temperature. What's he doing?

771
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:49,193
Stiker, that plane can't land itself,
it needs a pilot.

772
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:52,795
Ease off. It's not his fault.
It could happen to any pilot.

773
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:54,711
It happened to Barbara Stanwyck.

774
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:58,315
Can't push him too hard. Might break.
Remember who you're dealing with.

775
01:07:58,411 --> 01:08:00,516
Nick, Pete, Jerry,
there's a fire in the barn.

776
01:08:03,507 --> 01:08:05,777
He's right.
I can't take the pressure.

777
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,932
I was crazy to think
I could land this plane.

778
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,874
- But, Ted, you're the only...
- I don't care.

779
01:08:12,820 --> 01:08:14,364
I don't have what it takes.

780
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:17,587
They would be better off with someone
who's never flown before.

781
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:31,433
Bad news. Fog's getting thicker.

782
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:35,561
And Leon's getting larger.

783
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:01,508
I know what you're going to say,
so save your breath.

784
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:07,773
Well, I don't have a thing to say.

785
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:09,828
You've done the best you could.

786
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,921
You really have. The best you could.

787
01:09:14,380 --> 01:09:16,159
We can't expect to win them all.

788
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:23,082
I want to tell you something I've
kept to myself through these years.

789
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:26,162
I was in the war myself.
Medical corps.

790
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:31,745
One night, they brought in
a badly wounded pilot from one raid.

791
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:34,390
He could barely talk.

792
01:09:34,980 --> 01:09:37,016
He looked up at me, he said,

793
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:41,696
"The odds were against us there,
but we went in anyway."

794
01:09:41,780 --> 01:09:46,522
"I'm glad. Captain made
the right decision."

795
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:51,035
The pilot's name was George Zip.

796
01:09:53,180 --> 01:09:54,658
George Zip said that?

797
01:09:56,740 --> 01:09:58,696
The last thing he said to me,

798
01:09:58,780 --> 01:10:01,240
"Doc", he said, "sometime..."

799
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:04,536
"the crew is up against it."

800
01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:06,850
"The breaks are beating the boys."

801
01:10:06,940 --> 01:10:10,772
"Tell them to give it all they've got..."

802
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:15,077
"and win just one for the Zipper."

803
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:19,983
"I don't know where
I'll be then", he said...

804
01:10:21,740 --> 01:10:24,765
"but I won't smell too good,
that's for sure."

805
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:28,763
Excuse me, Doc.

806
01:10:30,180 --> 01:10:31,771
I've got a plane to land.

807
01:10:39,820 --> 01:10:41,811
You'd better stay up there a bit.

808
01:10:41,900 --> 01:10:44,130
When the fog lifts,
we'll bring you in.

809
01:10:44,220 --> 01:10:46,211
I'll take it, Elaine.

810
01:10:55,180 --> 01:10:59,222
Listen, Dr. Rumack says the sick
people are in critical condition.

811
01:10:59,660 --> 01:11:02,166
Every minute counts.
We've got to land now.

812
01:11:02,780 --> 01:11:06,773
Don't be a fool, Striker. You know what landing
like this means more than anybody.

813
01:11:06,860 --> 01:11:08,737
I'm ordering you to stay up there.

814
01:11:08,820 --> 01:11:10,731
No dice, Chicago.

815
01:11:10,820 --> 01:11:12,724
I'm giving the orders,
and we're coming in.

816
01:11:13,820 --> 01:11:16,215
I guess the foot's on the other
hand now, isn't it Kramer?

817
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:21,529
He'll never make it in this soup,
not one chance.

818
01:11:21,620 --> 01:11:25,135
I know I know, but it's his ship now, his
command, he's in charge.

819
01:11:25,759 --> 01:11:28,400
He's boss, head man, top dog,

820
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:30,630
big cheese, head honcho...

821
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:31,778
Captain, look at this.

822
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:35,314
"Passengers certain to die."

823
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:37,325
"Airline negligent."

824
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:39,860
There's a sale at Penny's!

825
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:46,716
I'll need three men in the tower.
You, Neubauer, you, Macias.

826
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,756
Me John. Big tree.

827
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:52,450
Striker, we're going to the tower.
Good luck.

828
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:54,305
They're going to the tower.

829
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:58,833
The tower, the tower!
Rapunzel, Rapunzel!

830
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:06,713
Stewardess, how soon till we land?

831
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:08,800
It won't be long now.
Try not to worry.

832
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:24,356
We're all ready, sir.

833
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:27,476
Captain McCroskey,
this is Captain Roberts.

834
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:29,676
Captain Kramer,
this is Captain Colosimo.

835
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,557
Captain Hinshaw,
this is Captain Gantz.

836
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:34,289
Captain Kramer, Captain Gantz.
Captain Hinshaw, Captain Roberts.

837
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:37,071
Colosimo, you work the relay.

838
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:39,276
Roberts, check air traffic.

839
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:43,159
Get that finger out of your ear.
You don't know where it's been.

840
01:12:45,860 --> 01:12:48,135
- Steve!
- Got a cigarette, Nels?

841
01:12:48,220 --> 01:12:51,735
Linda, your husband and the others
are alive but unconscious.

842
01:12:51,820 --> 01:12:53,731
Just like Gerald Ford.

843
01:12:53,820 --> 01:12:58,098
There's a chance we can save them
if Striker lands that plane in time.

844
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:00,955
That isn't much of a chance, is it?

845
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:03,975
I don't know. We're doing everything
we can. Now excuse me.

846
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:11,297
Where did you get that dress?
It's awful!

847
01:13:11,380 --> 01:13:14,258
And those shoes and that coat! Geez!

848
01:13:18,220 --> 01:13:21,929
8 miles. Turn right to heading 044.

849
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:27,318
We're now at 2,000 feet
beginning our descent.

850
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:31,871
- Steve, pour every light onto that field.
- It's being right done.

851
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:40,041
Tower to emergency vehicles,
runway is niner.

852
01:13:40,940 --> 01:13:44,410
Airport vehicles,
take positions one and two.

853
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:46,616
Civilian equipment, number three.

854
01:13:48,620 --> 01:13:51,373
Air force, positions four and five.

855
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:53,655
All ambulances go to number three.

856
01:13:53,740 --> 01:13:57,243
Air Israel, please clear the runway.

857
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:05,353
In a moment, we'll ask you
to assume crash positions.

858
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:08,115
Life jackets are under your seat.

859
01:14:08,697 --> 01:14:10,509
Place the jacket over your head.

860
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:13,990
When I give the word, pull the
cord on the right side flap.

861
01:14:15,976 --> 01:14:18,990
Your seat cushions are also equipped
with a flotation device.

862
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:24,818
WZAZ in Chicago,
where disco lives forever.

863
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:32,538
Your altitude's too erratic.
You can't come straight in.

864
01:14:32,620 --> 01:14:35,298
You've got enough fuel left for two
hours of flight.

865
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:38,246
I'll take it, Elaine.
Listen to me, Kramer.

866
01:14:39,020 --> 01:14:41,766
We have people up here who will die
in less than an hour.

867
01:14:43,140 --> 01:14:45,709
I may bend your precious airplane,
but I'll get it down.

868
01:14:45,956 --> 01:14:47,815
I'm putting the landing
gear down now.

869
01:14:48,060 --> 01:14:51,937
- Mr. Striker, the passengers are ready.
- Thanks, Randy.

870
01:14:52,140 --> 01:14:55,220
You better leave, sweetheart.
You might get hurt up here.

871
01:15:05,660 --> 01:15:08,553
- Ted...
- Yes?

872
01:15:09,020 --> 01:15:12,102
I wanted you to know now...

873
01:15:13,220 --> 01:15:14,952
I'm very proud.

874
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:21,444
Tell them the gear is down
and we're ready to land.

875
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:28,558
The gear is down and
we're ready to land.

876
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:31,574
He's on final now.

877
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,889
Put out all runway lights
except niner.

878
01:15:36,620 --> 01:15:39,674
Captain, maybe we ought to turn
on the searchlights now.

879
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:42,807
No.

880
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:45,852
That's just what they'll
be expecting us to do.

881
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:54,636
I want to tell you both good luck.
We're all counting on you.

882
01:15:57,620 --> 01:15:59,770
Now listen carefully.

883
01:15:59,860 --> 01:16:02,090
You'll see the runway at 300 feet.

884
01:16:02,180 --> 01:16:04,663
Touch down a third of the way along.

885
01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:07,689
A slight cross wind, so be ready.

886
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:10,658
Land too fast,
use your emergency brakes.

887
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:14,415
Red handle's right in front.
If that doesn't stop you...

888
01:16:20,740 --> 01:16:24,369
If that doesn't stop you, cur the four
ignition switches over the co-pilot's hand.

889
01:16:27,660 --> 01:16:31,631
Can you see us now? You should
be able to see the field now.

890
01:16:39,380 --> 01:16:42,237
- Sure is quiet out there.
- Yeah, too quiet.

891
01:16:44,660 --> 01:16:47,224
Looks like I picked the wrong week
to quit sniffing glue.

892
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:02,024
There it is.

893
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:06,037
There he is.

894
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,991
Striker, you're coming in too fast.

895
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:11,798
I know, I know!

896
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:13,677
He knows, he knows!

897
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:19,635
Below 700 now. Still going down.

898
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:23,395
675, 650, 625, he's holding.

899
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:25,311
No, he's down, he's down.

900
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:27,356
Sound your alarm now.

901
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:31,834
Now, everybody,
get in crash positions.

902
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,831
Put down 30 degrees of flap.

903
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:46,632
All right, listen to me.
Remember your brakes and switches.

904
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:48,438
Get ready to flare it out!

905
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:50,556
He's all over the place.

906
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:54,155
900 up to 1 ,300 feet.
What an asshole.

907
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:56,879
More left rudder. Put down more flap.

908
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:03,906
Just kidding.

909
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:08,911
Striker, lift your nose.
Straighten your wings.

910
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,878
Coming in too fast. Watch your speed.

911
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:13,588
He's coming right at us!

912
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:21,356
Coming in too hot.
Ease up on the throttle.

913
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:23,790
Watch out for that cross wind.
Level it out.

914
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:26,704
You'll have to dip your left wing.

915
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:33,956
You're drifting. Keep your eyes
on the far end of the runway.

916
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:37,957
You're too low, damn it!

917
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:41,318
Watch your stall speed.

918
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:45,993
Flare it out!

919
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:50,517
Ease her down. Down!

920
01:18:55,260 --> 01:18:58,138
The brake! Pull the red handle!

921
01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:05,521
I want to tell you both good luck.
We're all counting on you.

922
01:19:13,260 --> 01:19:17,651
Flight 209 now arriving
at gate 8.

923
01:19:17,740 --> 01:19:19,856
Gate 9.

924
01:19:19,940 --> 01:19:21,339
Gate 10.

925
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:24,014
Pull out of it! Push that button!

926
01:19:30,460 --> 01:19:33,611
Gate 13. Gate 14.

927
01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:35,213
Gate 15.

928
01:19:45,460 --> 01:19:48,657
Auntie Em! Toto! It's a twister!

929
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:54,615
Gate 23, 24, 25.

930
01:20:18,460 --> 01:20:21,673
I want to tell you both good luck.
We're all counting on you.

931
01:20:27,780 --> 01:20:28,473
Striker?

932
01:20:29,380 --> 01:20:33,532
- Striker, are you all right?
- Yeah. We're OK.

933
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:36,500
Ted, that was probably
the lousiest landing...

934
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:38,056
in the history of this airport.

935
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:41,751
But some of us, particularly me,

936
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:45,150
would like to buy you a
drink and shake your hand.

937
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:53,478
And Ted, when the going got rough...

938
01:20:56,700 --> 01:20:59,089
Have a nice day. OK.

939
01:20:59,180 --> 01:21:02,411
Have a nice day and thank you
for flying TransAmerican.

940
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:05,810
Loneliness, that's the bottom line.

941
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:09,391
I was never happy as a child.

942
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:11,675
Christmas,
what does that mean to you?

943
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:13,830
Mine was living hell.

944
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:16,878
Do you know what it's like
to fall in the mud...

945
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:19,758
and get kicked in the head
by an iron boot?

946
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:22,935
Of course not. It never happens.

947
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:25,315
Sorry. That's a dumb question.
Skip that.

948
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:32,839
There you go. Have a nice day.

949
01:21:48,460 --> 01:21:51,549
Municipal bonds, Ted.
Talking double ''A'' rating.

950
01:21:51,900 --> 01:21:53,368
Best investment in America.

951

01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:29,717
Well, I'll give him another 20
20 minutes, but that's it.
