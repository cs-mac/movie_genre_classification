25.000 English SDH

00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,955
# He is the man of the moment,
the man of today

3
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,510
# Yes, he's the man of the moment,
I'm happy to say

4
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,797
# But he's not here for the moment,
a man on his way

5
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,792
# Just a man of the moment for today

6
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,316
# He's no friend in fair weather,
enjoying the sun

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,915
# He'll quickly vanish forever
if a dark cloud should come

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,151
# The man of the moment
that I've waited for

9
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,755
# Will be my man
of the moment evermore

10
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,116
# Evermore, evermore

11
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,670
# He's not the kind to love 'em
and to leave 'em

12
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,070
# Evermore, evermore

13
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,232
# When he whispers loving words,
you can believe 'em

14
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,471
# He's no friend in fair weather,
enjoying the sun

15
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,189
# He'll quickly vanish forever
if a dark cloud should come

16
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,511
# The man of the moment
that I've waited for

17
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,958
# Will be my man
of the moment evermore #

18
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,509
All right. I'll see they all know.
Right. Goodbye.

19
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:59,117
- Morning, Florrie. Mr Vavistock.
- Morning, Norman.

20
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,714
Hey! Fancy the guv being late!

21
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,189
He's not coming in. He's got the flu.

22
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,238
What a time to pick,
with Tidmarsh on leave.

23
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,392
- Looks like you'll be in charge today!
- Yeah.

24
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,034
Yeah! Acting chief filing clerk! Me!

25
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,835
- Mrs Burton, that'll be all, thank you.
- Oh!

26
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,230
Well, don't stand there, woman.
Go on, run along.

27
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,832
Florrie...

28
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,992
You fell for that one, didn't you?

29
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,594
Oh, Norman!

30
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,513
I thought for a minute you were serious!

31
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,998
Oh, dear.

32
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,471
Morning, Sonia.

33
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,635
You and your film star.

34
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,230
- I saw her last night.
- You never!

35
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,311
- I did.
- In the flesh?

36
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,914
- No, in the pictures.
- Ah.

37
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,834
She weren't half smashing.
I saw it round twice.

38
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,277
If it isn't too inconvenient,
would you kindly get out the files

39
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,717
on Persian mineral deposits,
eastern substrata and pipeline personal?

40
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,758
Yes, sir. Acting chief filing clerk.

41
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,913
Persian mineral deposits,
eastern substrata, pipeline personal.

42
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,956
A, J, K.

43
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,118
Sorry to be so long, sir.

44
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,993
Tea up.

45
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,230
Well then, gentlemen,

46
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:59,110
you will be wondering about
the renewed interest in Tawaki.

47
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,795
Recent developments in the Pacific
have highlighted it

48
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,519
as a possible base of great importance.

49
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,713
One of the islands is uninhabited.

50
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,473
It has an excellent anchorage,

51
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,313
sheltered by an extinct volcano.

52
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,995
Many other countries have been in touch
with the Queen of Tawaki,

53
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:23,596
who is undecided whether to accept
or refuse their offers.

54
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,350
Gentlemen, your job
at the Geneva Conference

55
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,353
will be to get a decision in our favour.

56
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,556
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.

57
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:38,997
Very well. Jackson, get any files
you have on Tawaki sent up.

58
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,593
Right away, sir.

59
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,275
Filing room? Oh, Vavistock.

60
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,874
Away? Then Tidmarsh.

61
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,474
Away too? Then who am I talking to?

62
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,439
Norman? Very well, Norman.
Send up any files you have on Tawaki.

63
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,114
With the utmost celerity, sir.

64
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,673
If that's that the Tawaki file, hurry up.
Mr Jackson's waiting.

65
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,274
Norman? Here a minute.

66
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,271
- Are you going in there?
- Yeah.

67
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,035
Take the tea trolley for me, will you?
It's my tea break.

68
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,795
Isn't it marvellous?

69
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,395
I cannot overstress the importance
our government places

70
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,710
upon this conference at Geneva.

71
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,877
I had a chat with the PM only yesterday.

72
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,474
- And he said...
- Tea up!

73
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,312
Well, bring it in, boy!

74
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,277
(Trolley squeaking)

75
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,909
(Shouting) As I was saying,
I had a chat with the PM yesterday

76
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,389
and he said...

77
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,236
- As I was saying...
- (Clunking)

78
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,232
..I had a chat with the PM and he said...

79
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,232
- (Squeaking)
- .."Horace..."

80
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,315
- Why do you have this?
- I brought it...

81
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,949
- Never mind. Serve the tea.
- I'm not the tea boy!

82
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,270
- I'm the acting chief...
- Shh!

83
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,072
- Oh.
- Let's get down to details.

84
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,551
One thing, Jackson. How many members
do you envisage in the delegation?

85
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,471
- Five.
- How many?

86
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,278
Five.

87
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,194
I'm sorry. I mean eight.

88
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,675
I beg your pardon, but this says
there are six delegates.

89
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,671
My mistake. Six.

90
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,309
I wish you'd make up your mind.
They've melted now.

91
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,960
Is there anything of value on the island?

92
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,635
- Milk?
- No. No milk. Maybe a little oil.

93
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,517
Ain't it marvellous?

94
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:51,276
I'm not clear about this island's position
in relation to the mainland.

95
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,510
It's all quite clear on the map here.

96
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,160
Let me show you. Now, er...let me see.

97
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,310
- Where do you want it, sir?
- Just there.

98
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,308
- Take that away.
- You said...

99
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,356
Take it away!

100
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,749
Am I right in saying just there?

101
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,876
No, not there. There.

102
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,310
Will you take that away?

103
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,994
Oh, have a cake.

104
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,197
- Are there any rocks?
- Only one. Who's going to have it?

105
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,318
Will you get out?

106
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,551
There'll be six travelling.
Shall I lay on the transport?

107
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,552
- I take it we're going by air.
- Coming down.

108
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,314
I think we've covered everything now.

109
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,994
Take a filing clerk with you, Jackson.

110
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,594
Yes, sir. I'll see to that right away.

111
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,558
Oh! Where's that wretched tea boy?

112
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,232
Who wants me?

113
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,430
- Who did that?
- Get out!

114
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,715
Get out!

115
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,398
If you spent less time studying
movie stars and more on your job...

116
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,914
- Where's Mr Vavistock?
- Flu.

117
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,070
- Where to?
- No, sir, he's got flu.

118
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,116
- Where's his deputy?
- On leave.

119
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,191
- Where's his deputy?
- That's me.

120
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,316
- Good. Got a passport?
- No, sir.

121
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,676
Get one. Got any passport photos?
You'll need two.

122
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,751
I've got this one, sir.

123
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,958
That's me in the football team.
See if you can find me.

124
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,759
- Go on. Pick me out.
- No, that won't do.

125
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,195
Haven't you got one by yourself?

126
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,669
I've got this one. There you are.

127
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,751
It's not my body, of course.

128
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,308
You'd better get some done. File these.

129
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,551
That's all I've got.
Except one from when I was a baby.

130
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,390
- What are you doing up there?
- Putting these away.

131
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,517
Go and get your passport photos taken.

132
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,831
- What do I want photos for?
- You're going away tomorrow.

133
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,639
- Me? Where?
- Geneva.

134
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,792
Geneva? Me? Aargh! Aargh! Hey!

135
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,155
Hey!

136
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,310
- (Knocking)
- Come in.

137
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,676
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

138
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,274
- It's a lovely day.
- Perfectly glorious.

139
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,512
- The sun's shining and...
- Can you take a passport photograph?

140
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,353
- Yes, of course. Do sit down.
- Thank you.

141
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,595
- (Hissing)
- Oh!

142
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,069
Well, get off it, then!

143
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,675
Oh! Ho! Thank you.

144
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,830
Quite still, please.

145
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,711
- Ready?
- Oh! Ha, not me. Him.

146
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,953
No smiling, please.

147
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,713
I'm not. I've got a light
stuck right in me face.

148
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,439
Unfortunately, we have got to see you.

149
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:18,508
I cannot take you smiling. A passport
photograph must not look pleasant.

150
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,639
- And please remove your hat.
- I don't want to take me hat off!

151
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,312
Oh...

152
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,789
Would you like to go somewhere else?

153
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:32,000
- You can't. The Ministry sent him here.
- You know where you can go.

154
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,510
Come out of it. I'll show you.

155
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,794
Ah. Very good. Very good indeed.

156
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,996
Now...

157
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,396
No smiling, please.

158
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,954
Control yourself, please!

159
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:04,556
I can't help it! The more you stop me,
the more I seem to can't help it!

160
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,399
Pull yourself together!

161
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,074
I've got it... Oh, it's going!

162
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,755
Go on! Go on.
Now, force yourself. Go on.

163
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,276
That's it. Go on.

164
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,595
Control yourself!

165
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,636
Come on, then. Go on, take me.

166
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,598
Take me! You're too late!

167
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,509
You missed it again!
Here, look. I'll put this...

168
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,432
I'll put this over me face.

169
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,077
Go!

170
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,758
It's no good!

171
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,038
Leave me alone.
You go look at your camera.

172
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:35,073
- Where you been?
- Leave my studio immediately!

173
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,754
- I shall sue you for this.
- Really?

174
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,513
Oh! Oh... (Mumbling)

175
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,231
Got it.

176
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,755
- Now, are we all here, Mitchell?
- Everybody except the filing clerk.

177
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,400
Filing clerk not here? What a nuisance.

178
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,155
Never mind. He'll have to follow on later.
I think it's this way.

179
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,914
What in heaven's name...?

180
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,794
Oh, no! Not you.

181
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,194
Why, you...!

182
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,989
- Oh!
- Sorry, miss.

183
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,949
- Would you take your seat?
- I'm getting off at the next stop.

184
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,635
You're not allowed to stand, sir.
There is a seat vacant up here.

185
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,312
Be careful. You've done
enough damage for one day.

186
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,039
Would you fasten your belt please, sir?

187
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,351
- I don't wear one.
- I mean your safety belt, sir.

188
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,557
Oh! I thought you were getting me at it!

189
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,835
- Allow me.
- Thank you.

190
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,280
- Sonia!
- I beg your pardon?

191
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,239
Sorry. Picture of Sonia Karol.
Famous film star.

192
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,993
I reckon she's smashing.

193
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,470
When you've finished with that,
can I have it? Please?

194
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,632
Well, yes, in a minute.

195
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,154
Thank you very much.

196
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,629
Do you collect film stars' photographs?

197
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,429
Only hers. I've got 107!

198
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,431
Oh, sorry.

199
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,909
I think she's wonderful.

200
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,230
You must do.

201
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,357
- Enjoying your trip, madam?
- Very much, thank you.

202
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,671
- Everything all right, sir?
- Yes, thank you. Very nice.

203
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,990
Always is on this line.

204
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,833
- Who was that?
- The pilot.

205
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,354
Pilot? Well, who's driving, then?

206
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,237
Hey!

207
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,118
There is another pilot, you know.

208
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,949
(All exclaiming)

209
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:46,150
- You're the British delegation?
- Quite right.

210
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,949
- There will be no baggage examination.
- Thank you.

211
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,034
Hey, what's your game?

212
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,556
- Garfield?
- Yes?

213
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,790
- There you are.
- Cooper?

214
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,519
- I am here.
- You could have got it yourself.

215
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,477
Lloyd? Lloyd!

216
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,357
Hey, Lloydy, come on. Wake up!

217
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,113
That's private.
You can look after the heavy stuff.

218
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,670
There's one here with no name on.
Whose is this with no name on?

219
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,955
Ain't it marvellous?

220
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,316
Hey, it's mine! I'll take that.

221
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,550
Mitchell. Here y'are.

222
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,631
- Jennings?
- Yes?

223
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,517
Jackson. There y'are.

224
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,478
I'll look after this lot.
You can wash and brush up.

225
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,393
- Will you kindly control yourself?
- What's up?

226
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,357
Keep your voice down!

227
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,989
- (Softly) What's up?
- Oh... This way, gentlemen.

228
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,108
- What room am I in, please?
- Your name?

229
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,430
Norman. With the British delegation.

230
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,239
I'm afraid there is no reservation.

231
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,675
What, they left me out?

232
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,149
Hey, Mr Jackson! Mr Jackson!

233
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,550
- I ain't got nowhere to sleep.
- I forgot all about you.

234
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,598
- Would you look after my filing clerk?
- Yes, sir.

235
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,955
- This is he.
- Yes, sir.

236
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,395
Sign here, Mr Norman.

237
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,590
We are very busy.

238
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,593
Top floor. Room 700.

239
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,352
700.

240
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,668
Sorry!

241
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:52,435
- Have you got the key?
- Key?

242
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,117
- Room 700, please.
- Oui, monsieur.

243
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,439
Septième.

244
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,638
The top floor is for staff.
The staff is not allowed to use the lift.

245
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,109
- Oh, I can use the stairs, then?
- Oui.

246
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,156
You're very kind.

247
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,316
I'm only here for a week!

248
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,030
Cor blimey.

249
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,755
(Laughing) Smashing!

250
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,636
Ah! Ah!

251
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,276
(Whistle)

252
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,399
- Oh!
- Ooh!

253
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,519
- Sorry.
- It'd have to be you, wouldn't it?

254
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,114
- Yes. Er...no.
- What a nice surprise.

255
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,519
- Is it?
- No.

256
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,876
- Funny we should bump into each other.
- Most amusing.

257
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,991
- Isn't it marvellous? Hey, miss!
- Yes.

258
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,436
Miss, I know I'm awkward
but I really am sorry.

259
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,113
That was nice of you.
Is this your first trip?

260
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,237
- Yes. And yours?
- Mm, I'm on holiday.

261
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,437
- What are you doing?
- I'm with the British delegation.

262
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,193
- I'm attending a conference.
- Really?

263
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,955
- I'm chief filing clerk.
- How interesting.

264
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,679
A very responsible job.

265
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,035
Yes, I'm sure it is.

266
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,756

(lnaudible)

269
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,790
# All day long in Switzerland

270
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,350
# There's a song in Switzerland

271
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:58,194
# They yodel and yodel away

272

# It's the loveliest language they say

273

keeps your worries away

279
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,993
# And when there's a wedding,

Oh!

292
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,910
Penny!

293
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,357
- Good morning.
- Morning.

294
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,273
There are details to discuss on ltem 17.

295
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,999
- I'll ring for breakfast.
- Yes, right.

296
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,236
(Humming)

297
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,393
- Here is the Pacific Ocean.
- Yes, I see that.

298
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,713
And who did that?

299
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,748
Oh! Ooh! Oh!

300
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,589
Oh, my goodness!
My dear chap.

301
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,240
- Better have a look.
- This is an outrage!

302
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,471
Whoever it is,
they'll pay for this. The indignity!

303
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:48,519
Mitchell! For heaven's sake,
sit up, man. Ohh!

304
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,156
(Conversing quietly)

305
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,710
- Ground floor, please.
- Staff may not use the lift.

306
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,756
I'm not on the staff!

307
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,398
Hey!

308
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,838
Oh!

309
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,470
Coming down! Look out, miss!

00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,516
(Giggling)

311
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,556
Come here, my little duckling!

312
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,675
Which floor is...

313
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,796
Staff is not allowed to use the lift.

314
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,474
Which floor is Mr Jackson on?
He wants me.

315
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,039
Oh. Sixth floor.

316
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:09,671
Oh! I've gotta go up
all those stairs again!

317
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:22,915
You will be very careful
with Mr Mitchell, please.

318
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,833
- Norman.
- You wanted to see me?

319
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:29,469
I do indeed. So does the rest
of the delegation. Come this way.

320
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:33,030
Come this way, my boy.
Just sit down there, would you?

321
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,510
That's right.
Norman, a catastrophe has happened.

322
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,830
Mr Mitchell has been incapacitated.

323
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,639
He only got hit on the head with a bowl.

324
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,756
Oh. Er...

325
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,308
Tomorrow's conference is worrying us.

326
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,676
We'll only have five representatives.
Everyone else has six.

327
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,230
- We can't be outnumbered by Ecuador.
- Nor the United States.

328
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,595
- Good Lord, no.
- No.

329
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:59,229
- No.
- And so...can you put up your hand?

330
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,156
There's a clever boy.
Gentlemen, I ask you.

331
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,516
- Where did you learn to do that?
- At school, if I wanted to go to...

332
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,192
Naturally.

333
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:19,239
Tomorrow, but only for tomorrow,
you will take Mr Mitchell's place.

334
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:22,676
- Me?
- Yes. Just vote when I tell you to.

335
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,274
I'm going to be a delegate?

336
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,670
This is the unhappiest day of my life.
The answer is yes.

337
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,354
But only until Mr Mitchell returns.

338
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,749
- I'll have a suit like yours?
- Course.

339
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,150
- And stripes all down me trousers?
- Yes, indeed.

340
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,038
One minute. I want a proper room.

341
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,953
- With a window.
- That's very difficult.

342
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:46,350
Listen, no window...no delegate.

343
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,396
(All talking at once)

344
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,517
Phone down immediately.
A large room with a window.

345
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,909
- And I want a hat.
- Yes, a hat.

346
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,912
- Then I'll be the same as you!
- Course you will!

347
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,558
(Screaming)

348
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,710
I'll be one of the delegation!

349
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,712
This was Mr Mitchell's room, monsieur.

350
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,519
Monsieur? Key.

351
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:25,750
The gentleman who was moved into
Room 600 may now use the lift.

352
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,592
Bien.

353
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:39,316
Hello? It's Room 600 'ere.

354
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,509
(Posh voice)
This is Mr Norman's secretary speaking.

355
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:50,639
On his behalf, naturally.
Cos he's having a bit of a kip, see.

356
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,954
He's expecting his tailors,
and as soon as they arrive...

357
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,191
would you show them up? Splendid.

358
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,997
- (Knocking)
- Come in.

359
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,271
You rang, sir?

360
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,635
Cor!

361
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,871
Er... Oh, er...I thought
I was switching on the light.

362
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,712
Oh.

363
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:39,554
No, that is the light switch by your bed.

364
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,153
And, er...

365
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,310
this is the bell.

366
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,789
And that is the telephone.

367
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:52,629
But please, sir, ring again
if you need anything.

368
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,671
Erm...well, I'll...

369
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,668
- (Knocking)
- (Muffled) Come in!

370
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,753
Ja?

371
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,752
Nothing I want at all!

372
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,635
La chambre six cents,
s'il vous plaît, mademoiselle.

373
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,669
I'm in the bath!

374
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,036
- (Knocking)
- I'm in the bath!

375
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,556
Bonjour, monsieur.
Here we bring the new suit.

376
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,110
- Oh, my conference clobber!
- Bonjour, monsieur.

377
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,909
- If monsieur is fit, we can fit.
- Bonjour, monsieur.

378
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,950
So! Bon!

379
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,917
Bon, bon!

380
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:21,314
Smashing, eh? I shan't need
that any more, that's one thing.

381
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,356
Smashing, isn't it, eh?

382
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,510
Smashing! So...

383
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,638
I thought...

384
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,517
Hey, now, don't...

385
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,989
(Tailors giggling and chattering)

386
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,998
(Shouting)

387
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,036
(All shouting)

388
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,429
Oooh!

389
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,748
(Confused shouting)

390
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,871
Hilfe! Polizei!

391
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,111
Polizei!

392
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,953
Auf wiedersehen. Polizei!

393
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,916
Fellow delegates,

394
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,391
in this short survey,
I have been quite unable...

395
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,150
..as one single vote
against this resolution

396
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:35,153
will set back the work
of the six sub-committees

397
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,549
and 12 sub-sub-committees

398
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,232
- for 10 months.
- Gracious!

399
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,709
It is the earnest hope of my government

400
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:46,396
that all delegates will give it
their unanimous support.

401
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,596
(Applause)

402
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,752
We will now put this resolution
to the vote.

403
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,593
Those in favour, raise their hands.

404
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,352
- Sonia Karol!
- Sonia, darling.

405
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,795
Oh, please! Thank you.

406
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,111
- Would you like to name your...
- I haven't decided yet.

407
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,354
(Murmuring)

408
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:34,070
This way
to the distinguished visitors' gallery.

409
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,875
And now the next question...

410
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,952
Cor! Sonia Karol!

411
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,436
(Murmuring)

412
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,990
- Oh, I think you're smashing!
- (Laughter)

413
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:12,033
What's the matter with you lot?
She is smashing!

414
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,599
(lnaudible)

415
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,956
I say she ought to be a delegate,
that's what I say!

416
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:27,438
I've seen all your films.
I've got 107 of your pictures.

417
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,272
What's the matter with you?

418
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:40,433
The next question concerns
the islands of Tawaki.

419
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:44,399
The representatives from Tawaki,
at the request of their queen,

420
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,392
ask that discussion be postponed.

421
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,950
The queen requires more time
for consideration.

422
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,713
Mr Chairman, I really must protest.

423
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:58,157
This question has been raised
three times and it's always postponed.

424
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,279
We most definitely support the British
in this matter.

425
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,557
We too cannot agree
to a further postponement.

426
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,235
Under the rules of this conference,
any delegate in favour

427
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,949
of this postponement
may use his right of veto.

428
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,393
One of the British delegates
has voted in favour of postponement.

429
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:35,715
The Tawaki question
postponed till next session.

430
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,155
Get him out of here. Out. Quickly.

431
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:42,118
- What are you doing?
- You're wanted on the phone.

432
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:45,590
- Who, me?
- Yes. Through that door.

433
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,716
Hello?

434
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,878
Hello? Am I wanted on the phone?

435
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,474
Well, I was told...

436
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,835
Well, that's funny.

437
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:14,118
..dining with us.
Nothing formal, mind you.

438
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,760
We want to be very friendly with Tawaki.

439
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:20,355
- Vodka and caviar, six o'clock.
- A cocktail tonight?

440
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:24,319
- Allow me, please...
- Gentlemen, please excuse us.

441
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,432
(All complaining)

442
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,193
- (Knocking)
- Come in.

443
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,912
- Yes, gentlemen?
- Greetings.

444
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,912
- Did you want me on the blower?
- Blower?

445
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,036
Oh, telephone. Sorry.

446
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,680
Allow us to introduce ourselves.

447
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,115
He is Navu and I am Toki.

448
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:53,432
We are from Tawaki
and now, Honourable Sir...

449
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,278
- My name's Norman.
- Honourable Sir Norman.

450
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,750
We are grateful that you are
the only delegate to vote for us.

451
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,035
Oh, that was all a mistake.

452
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:09,636
Don't be so modest.
You are a brave man.

453
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,073
Am I?

454
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:14,994
Yes. You have the power and influence
to help our queen.

455
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,479
Me?

456
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:20,917
As you know, the great powers
are trying to take one of our islands.

457
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,956
Our queen is very sad.

458
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:27,955
We in Tawaki wish to be left
in peace and quiet,

459
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,156
not to be a strategic centre.

460
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:34,392
- Otherwise, you know what will happen?
- No.

461
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,473
Where once young lovers
sang love songs under coconut trees

462
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,155
there will be rough soldiers.

463
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:46,313
Where now the young girls
walk barefoot on golden sands,

464
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,391
they will walk on chewing gum.

465
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,596
(Tuts)

466
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:54,832
And all the beautiful flowers
will be choked by barbed wire.

467
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,990
And our gentle queen will weep.

468
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:02,234
- And our people will weep.
- The tears of Tawaki will fall like rain.

469
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:06,074
Bloomin' shame.

470
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:11,152
- Mademoiselle?
- The British delegation office?

471
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,231
- A droit, mademoiselle.
- Left?

472
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,392
- No, no. To the right.
- Thank you.

473
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,949
Find out who is the British delegate
who exercised the veto.

474
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,634
- The Tawaki question didn't come up?
- No.

475
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,950
We were blocked by one man.

476
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,634
You didn't tell me
you were a delegate.

477
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,075
I was terribly impressed.

478
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,755
Oh, well...
I wanted to keep it as a surprise.

479
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,957
Tell me, why did you exercise
your right to veto?

480
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,110
- Hm?
- Well...

481
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,397
That! Someone's got to
look after these people.

482
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,472
It's not right the way
they get kicked around.

483
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:56,393
So I've written to their queen.
Want to hear it?

484
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,278
Yes, please. Well, not if it's private.

485
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,477
Well, it is and it isn't. I'll read it to you.

486
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,835
"Dear Queen,

487
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:08,037
"I just heard
everyone's trying to get your island.

488
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:11,874
"The thought of barbed wire and
chewing gum has made me very sad.

489
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:15,635
"If I was you, I wouldn't let anyone
land on any of my islands.

490
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,029
"I am a member of the British delegation,

491
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:21,157
"and you can count on me
to look after your wishes.

492
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,593
"And so, dear Queen,

493
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:27,231
"hoping this finds you as it leaves me,
affectionately yours, Norman."

494
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,709
Norman, I think that's sweet of you.

495
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:36,757
Monsieur et Madame Bertrand de Laine.

496
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:40,116
Le Comte Antonio Riviera,
Général Coropolos.

497
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,989
Sir Humphrey and Lady Griffiths.

498
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,435
Contessa et Signorina Cozzi.

499
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:51,353
Mr, Mrs, Miss Joshua Rope.

500
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,310
Mademoiselle Sonia Karol.

501
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,034
Evening dress, sir,
and by invitation only.

502
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:10,591
I'm on the list. I'm one of the delegates.
There you are...er...

503
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,274
They missed me off again. Don't worry.

504
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:20,315
I'm sorry, sir.
Evening dress and by invitation only.

505
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,236
- Isn't that De Groot?
- I think you're right, sir.

506
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,476
I hope Mitchell's evening dress
is in here. Where is it?

507
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,391
Right at the back, I suppose.

508
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,429
I'll show 'em! Evening dress!

509
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,909
- Hey, missus!
- Monsieur! Attention!

510
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,230
Oh, I'm sorry!

511
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,799
Non, non!

512
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,750
- Mes verres. Oh!
- Oh.

513
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:49,594
- Careful.
- Ah. Ah, that's fine.

514
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:53,992
- If you will permit me, sir...
- Hey! Me neck!

515
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,236
No, monsieur. No, no.

516
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,112
Allow me. Thank you.

517
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,350
I'm sorry, miss. I didn't do it on purpose.

518
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,670
Hey! Hey, what's your game?

519
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,473
Take it up. Sixth floor.

520
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,834
There y'are. Evening dress.

521
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,038
- Thank goodness that's over.
- It was terrible!

522
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,634
I would like to go to
the Beau Rivage café.

523
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,631
Well, let's go.

524
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:18,516
- It's all right.
- Oh, please. Be happy for my sake.

525
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,117
Monsieur?

526
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,873
Oh, er... Oh, coffee, please.

527
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,110
When you bring it, just leave it here

528
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:31,317
cos I'm gonna dance with
the famous Miss Sonia Karol.

529
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,799
Oui, monsieur.

530
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,075
- Champagne.
- Oui, monsieur.

531
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,754
..you don't play cricket?

532
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,037
Your fan.

533
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:54,793
Miss Karol,
can I have a dance with you, please?

534
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:58,919
Erm...I'm sorry. I'm much too tired.

535
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,516
I won't dance quick.
You can set the pace, long as I have one.

536
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:06,717
I'm much too tired this evening.
Please forgive me.

537
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,836
I don't mind waiting.

538
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,229
She said she's tired.

539
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,478
Goodbye.

540
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:38,555
I didn't dance cos she's tired
and I didn't want to bother her.

541
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,392
Oui, monsieur.

542
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,432
(lnaudible over music)

543
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,556
(lnaudible)

544
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:37,990
# My head and my heart are in trouble

545
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:46,875
# They argue what's right
and what's wrong

546
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:52,478
# My head thinks it's stupid

547
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:57,350
# To make dates with cupid

548
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:08,669
# My heart finds its reasons are strong

549
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:14,835
# The moonshine in your hair

550
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:19,755
# Suggests a love affair

551
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:25,631
# But I hear a voice within me whispering

552
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:29,554
# "Beware"

553
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:35,237
# The beauty of your face

554
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:40,189
# Invites a fond embrace

555
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:46,799
# But I hear a voice within me whispering

556
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:54,150
# "Beware, beware"

557
00:45:54,240 --> 00:46:02,158
# Memories of past loves are fleeting

558
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:11,956
# Into my heart you are creeping

559
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:17,717
# My heart you will entice

560
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:22,032
# My head whispers this advice

561
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:27,990
# "Now, beware

562
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,398
# "Beware

563
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:42,799
# "Beware" #

564
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,836
(Applause)

565
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:52,673
Wonderful.

566
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:55,115
- Oh, please go and see who it was.
- Me?

567
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,953
- Yes, please, hurry.
- (Sighs)

568
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:18,196
- News from Geneva, Mother?
- Yes, dear.

569
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:23,070
Toki says that all the great powers
are offering great riches for Mahoola.

570
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:27,438
But nobody lives there, Mother.
The evil spirits are so strong!

571
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,272
Even the volcano is dead!

572
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:32,477
What harm could it do us
if other people went there?

573
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:37,236
We'd lose our peaceful way of living.
Then what would the riches be worth?

574
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:41,757
Now, what's this about?
"Dear Queen,

575
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:47,312
"I just heard
everybody's trying to get your island.

576
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:51,234
- "And I thought..."
- Who's the letter from, Mother?

577
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:54,710
"Affectionately yours, Norman."

578
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,631
(Explosion)

579
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,631
Mahoola speaks!

580
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,354
An omen! A good omen!

581
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:09,193
Who is he that writes
and wants nothing from me?

582
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:13,796
He is the one to trust.
What he counsels, so will I decide.

583
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:17,714
But Mr Jackson said I could be
a delegate till Mr Mitchell got better!

584
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:22,794
You did enough damage on your first
and last appearance for our country.

585
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,916
You said there were six and I...

586
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,072
Norman, one thing
seems to have escaped you.

587
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:31,197
You are finally and definitely dismissed.

588
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,840
You can't give me the sack!
I won't take it!

589
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:37,037
I'm a civil servant!
I'm acting chief filing clerk!

590
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:39,873
I'm as good as you.
I have a bath every Sunday.

591
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:42,758
Why should I be messed about?
Take a running jump.

592
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:45,149
(Phone)

593
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:46,992
Hello? Hello.

594
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:48,911
What is it?

595
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,911
No. No.

596
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,831
- Well, he ain't.
- (Knocking)

597
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,474
Isn't.

598
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:59,073
Hello, Miss Penny.

599
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:02,516
I was in the chamber.
I thought you were ill or something.

600
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:06,798
I did have a pain in me stomach
so I couldn't vote.

601
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:10,156
- Did you?
- It's not the truth, really.

602
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,038
Mr Jackson won't let me be
a delegate any more.

603
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:15,111
Oh. I see.

604
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,997
- (Knocking)
- Come in.

605
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,710
Oh, hello!

606
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:27,157
- This is Miss Penny Harvey.
- Er...your woman?

607
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:29,231
Well, er...

608
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:34,476
Greetings to
Honourable Sir Norman's woman.

609
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:39,315
My queen sends this reply to your letter.

610
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:44,592
"Her Most Excellent Majesty,
the Queen of Tawaki,

611
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:47,114
"requests me to thank
the Honourable Sir Norman

612
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,316
"for his most considerate letter,

613
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:53,632
"and is very content to leave the
interests of Tawaki in his good hands.

614
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:56,712
"Until he advises her
to agree to any nation's requests

615
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:00,429
"for the right to establish a base
on her island of Mahoola,

616
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:03,557
"she will maintain a steadfast refusal.

617
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:08,395
"Tahou Tanahoola,
Secretary to Her Most Excellent Majesty."

618
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:12,875
The love of the people of Tawaki

619
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,793
is with the only white man
who has written to their queen

620
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:18,030
without hope of gain.

621
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:22,750
Would Honourable Sir be gracious
enough to give photo to take to queen?

622
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,959
Such humility for so great a man
to carry so small a photograph!

623
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:37,352
It will be easy for the queen
to carry with her always.

624
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:40,591
Oh, yes, yes. She will be happy.

625
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:44,673
Honourable Sir Norman,
may your days be many.

626
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:49,880
And may you have many sons,
all like Honourable Sir Norman.

627
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:55,111
Farewell.

628
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:03,957
When he said about you having...

629
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:06,952
If Sir Norman doesn't wipe
that grin off his face,

630
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,634
Sir Norman's woman
will wipe it off for him.

631
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:13,349
The leader of the Brodnian delegation
is expecting to see you.

632
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:17,558
Until Honourable Sir Norman say yes,
my queen say nobody come to Mahoola.

633
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:20,313
- But he is waiting!
- If Honourable Norman say no,

634
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,356
nothing doing.

635
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,036
- Well?
- Nothing doing.

636
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:32,714
Except through this
Honourable Sir Norman.

637
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:36,554
It seems that the queen of Tawaki
trusts him implicitly.

638
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:43,914
It would be better if this Honourable
Sir Norman would be out of the way.

639
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:13,355
(Ship's whistle)

640
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,748
Hello, Penny.

641
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:19,910
- Am I late?
- No, I just got here.

642
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,877
- Good. True?
- True.

643
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:24,872
- What would you like?
- Coffee, please.

644
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:26,712
- Monsieur?
- Two coffees.

645
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,678
- Black or white?
- Just brown.

646
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,671
- OK.
- Bags of sugar.

647
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,952
Do you have to
chain that case to your wrist?

648
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:39,430
Well, as a delegate,
you've got to be careful.

649
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:42,990
Excuse me, have I the honour
to address Mr Norman?

650
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,513
That's right.

651
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:49,390
I have been requested to hand this
into your own safekeeping.

652
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:52,392
- What is it?
- A small token of appreciation

653
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,994
from the conference committee.

654
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:57,958
- Thank you.
- In the meantime, may I suggest -

655
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:01,589
it is very valuable -
that you put it in a safe place.

656
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:05,559
Perhaps it would be best
in the despatch case, no?

657
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,870
That's a good idea.

658
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:13,951
Allow me.

659
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:18,873
Thank you. Now it's as safe
as the Bank of England.

660
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,236
Excellent. Mademoiselle. Monsieur.

661
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:27,110
- That was very nice of him, wasn't it?
- I'm not so sure.

662
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,792
(Ticking)

663
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:32,633
- Hey, Norman! Listen!
- What are you doing?

664
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:36,269
- It's ticking!
- Yes. Perhaps it's a clock!

665
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:38,351
It's a bomb!

666
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:40,476
Where's the key?

667
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:43,710
I don't know! I had it a minute ago!

668
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,756
That man! He pinched the key!

669
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:50,116
- Can't you undo the chain?
- That one's in the hotel!

670
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:53,431
- It's going to explode!
- You go away! Run for it!

671
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:57,638
- No, or I shall never see you again!
- It's making a funny noise now!

672
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:59,358
(Shrieking)

673
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:07,599
It's still ticking! Stay where you are!

674
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:10,399
- What are you going to do?
- Get the other key!

675
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:14,399
(Shrieking) Get out, everyone!
It's a bomb!

676
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,994
Get out of the way, everybody!

677
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,950
(Gibbering)

678
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,996
Sir, no! Excuse me, sir.

679
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:27,878
Please, use the lift.
The manager says you can.

680
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:30,235
- Hurry up.
- You are going up, sir?

681
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:32,515
Yeah, any minute now.

682
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,358
Wait for me!

683
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,550
Where's the key?

684
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,631
I'm going to get blown up in a minute!

685
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,517
Oh, got it! I got it!

686
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:59,757
Argh! Oi! Oi!

687
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:11,151
I'll see you on the ground floor.

688
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:13,196
- Not using the lift?
- Not me.

689
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:17,114
- This is making a funny noise.
- It'll do better than that in a minute.

690
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:24,030
The lift! Hey! Hey! It's a bomb!

691
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:29,437
It's a bomb! Look out! Look out!

692
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:33,878
Stay clear! Bomb! Hey!

693
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:42,993
Monsieur!

694
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:45,640
- No!
- Vous avez laissé quelque chose!

695
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:50,316
I don't want it! It's a bomb!
We'll both get killed!

696
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,515
Oui, oui, oui.

697
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:54,194
Leave it on the seat
and mind your own business!

698
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:56,589
Monsieur!

699
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:59,717
Out of the way! It's a bomb!
lt'll go off in a minute!

700
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:08,030
Oh, no! Shoo! Shoo!

701
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,758
Shoo! Shoo!

702
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,356
Get out of it! Shoo!

703
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:17,671
Watch out! Oh, no!

704
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,637
Go away! Go on! Hop it!

705
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:21,358
Go on! Go!

706
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,749
Get out of it! lt'll go up in a minute!

707
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:28,392
Go away! Go on, hop it! Go on!

708
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:29,879
Oh, God!

709
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:32,758
- Go away!
- I thought you got rid of it!

710
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:33,989
No! Run! Run!

711
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:39,953
- What did you do with the bomb?
- Threw it on that waste ground.

712
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:42,600
- It'll go up in a minute.
- (Ticking)

713
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,596
What's that?

714
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:48,750
Sounds near, doesn't it?

715
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:21,638
- Well?
- It didn't work.

716
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,709
What do you mean, it didn't work?

717
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:30,918
- The bomb worked, but he escaped.
- You...you moron!

718
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,752
You...you fool!

719
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:43,156
Oh, darling, would you come here
a minute, please?

720
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:44,912
Yes, right away.

721
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,675
Believe me, Chief, it wasn't easy.

722
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:53,675
It was an important job
and you bungled it, you useless idiot.

723
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:01,672
- Well?
- Darling, I have a job for you.

724
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,512
OK.

725
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:18,558
(Norman laughing)

726
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:23,918
I'll tell you what. I'll get packed
and then we'll have some dinner.

727
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,037
- In our little café?
- Yes, in our own little café.

728
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:29,998
How lovely, Norman.
That'll be wonderful.

729
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:33,789
Yes. Then we'll catch a plane
for London together.

730
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:35,632
- Good.
- So you get packed.

731
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:37,073
But I have packed.

732
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:39,549
- Have you stuck your labels on?
- Oh, no!

733
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:43,519
Stick your labels on,
then I'll meet you at 9:00 as we arranged.

734
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:45,511
All right. Goodbye.

735
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:47,431
Bye.

736
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:08,990
(Mouthing)

737
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:25,797
Won't you sit down?

738
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:34,838
I want to apologise to you, little man.

739
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:39,151
- Yeah?
- I want us to be friends.

740
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:41,549
Real friends.

741
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:43,437
That suits me!

742
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:46,796
Oh, I'm so glad!

743
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:50,633
Shall I go and get you
a bottle of ginger beer?

744
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:54,554
I have a better idea, my friend.
You shall have dinner with me.

745
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,710
Oh, I couldn't do that.

746
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,631
Alone.

747
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,915
Oh, yeah!

748
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:07,472
Oh, I've...I've got a date.
I've got to go back to...London.

749
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:11,155
- There is plenty of time for all that!
- Yeah?

750
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:14,951
Tell me...

751
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:18,999
have you ever seen the view
of the lake from the mountainside?

752
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:23,233
- No.
- Oh, you must.

753
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:26,596
I will show you everything this evening.

754
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:29,240
(Gurgles)

755
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:31,993
My car will call for you, then, at 8:30.

756
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:35,230
Goodbye.

757
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,596
(Doorbell)

758
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:52,509
- It's me.
- Well, come in!

759
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:55,558
- Come on.
- All right, then.

760
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:08,555
I nearly forgot. I brought you these.

761
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:11,029
How nice of you!

762
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:13,076
They're flowers.

763
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:15,879
Well, put them down and come along in.

764
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:23,029
(Parrot) Not there, you fool!

765
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,638
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

766
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:29,996
Where am I gonna put 'em, then?

767
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:31,957
Oh...

768
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:44,113
Norman...

769
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,077
come here.

770
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:58,154
Come and sit down next to me.

771
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:01,430
Not there. Here.

772
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:07,356
Closer.

773
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:11,428
- Closer.
- More?

774
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:16,995
There we are.

775
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:25,751
(Giddy gurgling)

776
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:29,355
What is the matter? Don't you like me?

777
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:32,989
- Oh, yeah. Smashing.
- Well, then?

778
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:35,150
Oh! Ah!

779
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:44,515
Norman? My cigarettes.
They are in my bedroom.

780
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:46,511
Would you get them for me?

781
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:48,591
Straightaway.

782
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:56,318
(Gunshot)

783
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:03,519
(Gunshot)

784
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:06,276
(Pop!)

785
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:09,272
Please help me, Norman! There you are.

786
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:19,156
Oh, Norman,
do please come and sit down.

787
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:31,832
Do you want a cigarette?

788
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:34,514
- I never use them.
- Nonsense.

789
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:36,830
Here you are. Puff.

790
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:42,156
Ah!

791
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:44,196
Give us a hand.

792
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:45,998
Hey!

793
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:49,711
Oh, come here. Give it to me.

794
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:53,911
And give me that.

795
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:59,116
- Huh?
- Oh...

796
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:05,832
Oh, Norman, would you do me
another favour?

797
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:09,708
Would you get my slippers?
They're beside the mirror.

798
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:11,950
- Yeah.
- Go on, now.

799
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:23,231
Hey! Hey!

800
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:35,830
- You dirty, rotten crooks!
- Go on, you fools!

801
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:39,549
How did I fall in love with you?
Fancy you mixed up with this lot.

802
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:41,835
Now, keep away! Help!

803
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:47,268
Help! I'm being attacked! Hey!

804
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:51,670
Help! Hello? Help! Fire!

805
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:54,672
- He's on the end!
- Do something! Use your knife!

806
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:58,469
- Help! Ah! Hello!
- (Man) 'Hold on, please.'

807
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:00,357
I am holding on!

808
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:08,430
- Monsieur, what are you doing?
- I was on the phone and I got cut off.

809
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:17,079
Would you fasten your seatbelt, madam?

810
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:19,913
- Good heavens!
- Oh!

811
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:31,391
Well, I...

812
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:53,678
Gentlemen,
the Queen of Tawaki says no.

813
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:55,751
What?

814
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:58,513
(Translates in Russian)

815
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:04,394
(Translates into Chinese)

816
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:07,756
You mean, the decision must be left
to your government?

817
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:10,115
- No.
- Your queen?

818
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:13,033
- No.
- For heavens' sake, who is it left to?

819
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:16,829
Honourable Sir Norman.
He look after queen's wishes.

820
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:19,992
- Who's Honourable Sir Norman?
- Never heard of him.

821
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:21,991
Er...allow me.

822
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:27,593
Don't know him. Would you, er...

823
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:30,148
- You know this fellow?
- No.

824
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:33,277
- But you must know him.
- No.

825
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:35,590
Do you know him?

826
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:38,069
- Good gracious!
- What?

827
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:41,758
Norman!

828
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:46,038
You mean this man is the man
the Queen will listen to?

829
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:49,192
That is so. Honourable Sir Norman.

830
01:06:55,400 --> 01:07:00,428
Are you telling me that this
little filing clerk has the Queen's ear?

831
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:05,310
- Yes, Sir Horace. But don't ask me how.
- Dash it, man, I do ask you!

832
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:10,478
- Are you sure it's the same Norman?
- Undoubtedly, Sir Horace.

833
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:13,950
Did you instruct him to take any part
in the negotiations?

834
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:16,190
Indeed I did not, sir.

835
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:18,350
Get him here! Get him here at once!

836
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:22,319
- I, er...
- Well, man? Well?

837
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:25,949
- I have a confession to make.
- Get on with it!

838
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:29,032
I fired him, sir. I sacked him.

839
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:31,076
You what?!

840
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:33,390
Now, where is it?

841
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:34,754
There.

842
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:36,956
Now, what are you going to say?

843
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:42,431
"Please, Sir Horace,
can I have my old job back?

844
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:45,478
- "Cos..." Oh, I can't!
- Hey.

845
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:50,195
Jump to it!
Put the international police on the job.

846
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:55,308
Send out a search party! And get Norman
what's-his-name, whatever the cost.

847
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:57,914
"Please, Sir Horace,
can I have me old job back?

848
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,912
"Cos Penny won't marry me
unless I do get it back

849
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,389
- "and she's the girl for me."
- Yes.

850
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:10,595
(Sir Horace, bellowing) Come in!

851
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:14,556
Good luck.

852
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:21,597
- Well? What do you want?
- That's him er...he, sir.

853
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:24,672
- Who?
- Honourable Norman. I mean, Norman.

854
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:28,548
My boy, how good to see you.
Come along this way, please.

855
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:30,756
- Here he is. Norman.
- Sir Horace...

856
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:35,789
My dear fellow. My dear Norman.
I'm delighted to see you. Delighted.

857
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:38,952
Now, then, Norman.
May I call you Norman?

858
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:41,395
- The cabinet will be told.
- Told what?

859
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:44,119
Oh, come now. No mock modesty.

860
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:46,953
- Mock who?
- Splendid work.

861
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:49,429
I'm delighted. An excellent move.

862
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:53,593
So the Queen of Tawaki
relies on you entirely, eh?

863
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:56,672
You could say we're pen pals.

864
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:59,479
Pals, eh? Ha, ha.
Yes, yes, of course.

865
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:02,279
Pals, eh? Well, my dear Norman.

866
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:05,432
The Ministry is pleased.
Very pleased, indeed.

867
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:08,159
In fact, we're giving a little party for you.

868
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:11,312
- A little soirée.
- I'd sooner have a party, sir.

869
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:14,710
Of course.
A little diplomatic get-together, eh?

870
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:18,349
I think the government will want you
to complete your mission.

871
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:21,716
- Sir Horace, can I have me job back?
- Why, of course!

872
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:24,837
- Penny? Can she come to the party?
- His fiancée.

873
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:28,071
- Delighted.
- Oh, good! Hey, Penny!

874
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:30,958
You can come in now! I've got it!

875
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:41,918
- Shall we look at some furniture first?
- Oh, yeah.

876
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,992
- Oh, can I help you?
- In a little while.

877
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:48,436
- We're just having a look round.
- Very good, sir.

878
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:58,471
(Music starts)

879
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:10,712
# I've got a dream for sale

880
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:16,193
# Will you buy a lovely dream for sale?

881
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:22,628
# Won't you try?
If you will close your eyes

882
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:26,759
# Maybe you can visualise

883
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:33,359
# I'll try to visualise
# A cottage by the shore... #

884
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:38,275
- Painted white?
- # With roses round the door

885
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:44,754
# Gay and bright
# A cosy fireside chair

886
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:50,231
# Big enough for two to share

887
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:58,108
# I like to think
I've made a good impression

888
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:06,073
# I love you, darling,
you're my one obsession

889
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:11,109
# Oh, a chance like this,
I can't afford to miss

890
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:18,436
# It's a fairy tale
with "vacant possession"

891
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:25,392
# If you would care to view

892
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:30,315
# Here's the key of paradise for two

893
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:34,518
# You and me

894
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:38,036
# If you will say you'll be mine

895
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:42,955
# I'll take down the sign

896
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:52,711
# That says I've got a dream for sale

897
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:24,477
# If you will say you'll be mine

898
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:29,634
# I'll take down the sign

899
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:44,238
# That says I've got a dream for sale #

900
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:47,751
Do you take me for a raving lunatic?

901
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:51,230
Sir, the Queen of Tawaki
is under the impression

902
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:54,756
she conducted her negotiations
with a titled diplomat -

903
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:57,229
Honourable Sir Norman.

904
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:59,834
- You mean I...
- I'm afraid so, sir.

905
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:02,912
You must recommend him
for a knighthood.

906
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:09,910
Oh, no!

907
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:26,834
- Well done, Sir Norman!
- Well done!

908
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:37,758
General, you know this guy Norman?

909
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:41,435
The one who has the inside track
with the Queen of Tawaki?

910
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:45,479
- The British have just decorated him.
- Trying to steal a march?

911
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:48,518
- What do you figure we should do?
- Well...

912
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:51,194
Anything the British can do, we can do.

913
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:55,511
Washington. Decorations Board.

914
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:57,556
(Speaking Chinese)

915
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:19,355
..present you with
the Brodnian Order of the Blue Dahlia

916
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:22,512
for courage and service to diplomacy.

917
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:33,518
You know Mr Jackson?

918
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:37,918
Jackson. Jackson, Jackson.

919
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,117
- Young man, if you don't behave...
- Name's Norman.

920
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:43,395
Sir Norman, Jackson.

921
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:46,199
Very well. To remind you, Sir Norman,

922
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:49,909
you are due at the television studios
for Town Topics.

923
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,309
We leave on the stroke of ten.

924
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:55,039
My dear Jackson, such efficiency.

925
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:57,588
You really are hot stuff. Isn't he?

926
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:02,758
Norman, I've just thought of something.

927
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:06,355
When we're married,
I shall be Lady Norman, won't I?

928
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:08,954
- You're a lady now.
- Thank you.

929
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:13,113
You know your instructions.
Concentrate on the girl.

930
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:15,794
If we get her, we've really got Norman.

931
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:19,589
Only need a fairy on me head
and I'll look like a Christmas tree.

932
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:22,717
- Good evening.
- They'll take a lot of living up to.

933
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:26,918
- Why?
- Norman, you haven't earned them yet.

934
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:31,232
- Then why did they give them to me?
- They all want part of Tawaki.

935
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:35,836
But I can't do them any favours.
I've got to look after the Queen.

936
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:39,196
I want to be loyal
but I can't let them mess about...

937
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:43,710
- Oh, no.
- Exactly.

938
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:46,109
Honourable Sir Norman's on the spot.

939
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:49,590
Then they can keep their medals.
I don't want them.

940
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:51,796
- I'll give them back now.
- No! No!

941
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:56,715
Ah, there you are. The car to take you
to the television studio is here.

942
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:00,156
- Hey, I want to talk to you.
- Later, Norman.

943
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:05,791
- Hello, Mac.
- Hello.

944
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:08,155
- What are you doing?
- Town Topics.

945
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:09,832
- Again?
- And you?

946
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:12,878
- A Greek play.
- Again?

947
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:14,712
- Mister?
- What?

948
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:16,631
- Now?
- No, no, not now.

949
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:23,591
Your jolly good health.

950
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:30,398
'Good evening. This is another edition
of Television Town Topics,

'in which we present interesting people
who are in the news today.'

All our worries are over!

953
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:41,315
And here is our first guest,
the distinguished diplomat

954
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:45,279
who one might justly describe as
"the man of the moment".

If you want to see,
there's a little room up there.

956
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:52,232
Thank you.

957
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:56,672
Erm... Well, Sir Norman,

958
01:16:56,760 --> 01:17:01,072
would you tell us what you
intend to do about the Tawaki imbroglio?

959
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:05,232
- Pardon?
- The Tawaki imbroglio.

960
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:08,914
Oh, er... Oh, well, erm...

961
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,639
I shall turn it over in me mind.

962
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:13,517
Splendid.

963
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:26,710
And another thing what I've made up
me mind I'm going to do is, erm...

964
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:30,793
I'm going to sort out everything
so everyone gets a fair chance,

965
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:34,111
- like, all round.
- Splendid.

966
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:38,393
Sir Norman,
I understand that you are engaged.

967
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:40,232
Oh, yeah.

968
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:42,595
My fiancée's here.

969
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:44,875
She's up there having a look.

970
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:49,038
I wonder if we might ask you her name.

971
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:51,350
Penny!

972
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:54,951

Now the mixture's perfectly blended
and the soufflé's ready for the oven.

975
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:10,029
Marvellous.
Now, the oven is at 450 degrees.

976

- Help me, please! Help!
- My soufflé!

- Hey!
- Get out of my kitchen!

979
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:22,910
- Get out of my kitchen!
- Penny! Penny!

- Dad, where's Pat?
- She'll be back soon.

988
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:50,475
- What's her new boyfriend like?
- Very nice. Reliable type. Unlike you.

989

No good will come of it. Mark my words.

Grab this, Penny! Come on! Grab hold!

Yes! Hold on!

It's Percy. In an evening dress...
I mean, a suit,

Trousers and tails.

And you'll notice that...

1007
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:14,950
All right, Charlie. All right, Joe.
You've had it. Back up.

1008
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:18,476
I think we'll send you to the country
for a long holiday.

1009
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:21,472
Sir, these two ruffians
won't bother you again.

1010
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:24,791
I'm Inspector Fabian of Scotland Yard.

1011
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:28,759
Thank goodness! I've had
a terrible time. We've been running...

1012
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:31,673
- Go away! Get out!
- What are you talking about?

1013
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:35,833
- There they are, Inspector. Arrest them!
- Go away.

1014
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:40,198
It's my duty to arrest you. Anything
you say will be taken down and...

1015
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:46,390
Ain't you going to arrest them?

1016

It's perfectly blended
and the soufflé's ready for the oven.

1017
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:01,631
I'll check that the oven's
at the right temperature.

1018
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:04,188
This oven should be at 450 degrees...

1019

Stay out! Stay out!

Cop this lot!

1021

If you try to get hold of me Penny
you'll get more than you bargained for!

1022
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:16,800
No, no, no! Not my soufflé!

1023
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:26,518

and make the next one.

gratitude, Honourable Sir Norman.

It's nothing.
I'd like to have a little chat...

1056
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:09,912
Your Majesty, we are here today at the
special instigation of our government

01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,958
to discuss with you the possibility
and desirability

to grant concessions on Mahoola
solely to our government.

Whereon, if it is agreeable to you,

1061
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:25,708
it is the purpose of my government,
when those rights are assigned,

1062

that we will use the island as a base
for experiments.

If it is agreeable to Your Majesty,

1064

it is further understood that for the
experiments to be conducted properly,

1065

certain precautions will be necessary
to safeguard secrecy.

in territorial waters
