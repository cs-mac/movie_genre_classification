00:00:54,363 --> 00:00:55,044
You know comics?

3
00:00:55,042 --> 00:00:55,906
You know comics?

4
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:57,288
Oh, please.
I'm listening. I'm all ears.

5
00:00:57,475 --> 00:00:59,460
Please, please, tell me!

6
00:00:59,651 --> 00:01:01,818
It's not just comics.

7
00:01:02,017 --> 00:01:02,977
It's about cash.

8
00:01:03,169 --> 00:01:04,195
We could have split it.

9
00:01:04,386 --> 00:01:05,921
We could have split it? No!

10
00:01:06,115 --> 00:01:07,515
It's all mine!

11
00:01:07,714 --> 00:01:09,671
Why? Why? Why would
I split it with you?

12
00:01:09,858 --> 00:01:11,363
Because we were
in this together.

13
00:01:11,554 --> 00:01:14,240
No! I'm in this alone!

14
00:01:14,434 --> 00:01:16,036
My whole life!

15
00:01:16,226 --> 00:01:19,391
Every waking, sleeping,
dreaming moment of my life,

16
00:01:19,586 --> 00:01:21,159
I spent for comics.

17
00:01:21,346 --> 00:01:22,756
What do you
live for, my friend?

18
00:01:22,946 --> 00:01:23,809
You know comics?
You know shit!

19
00:01:23,814 --> 00:01:25,511
You know comics?
You know shit!

20
00:01:25,698 --> 00:01:27,482
Is that what it would
have taken to share?

21
00:01:27,682 --> 00:01:29,859
I know comics, too.

22
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,227
I--I grew up with them.

23
00:01:32,418 --> 00:01:34,432
Oh, yeah, you know comics.

24
00:01:34,626 --> 00:01:36,553
You're the oracle
of delphi of comics.

25
00:01:36,738 --> 00:01:37,956
Yes, um, uh...

26
00:01:38,146 --> 00:01:39,710
First appearance
of superman?

27
00:01:39,906 --> 00:01:41,920
Uh,
action comics
#1.

28
00:01:42,114 --> 00:01:43,044
Everyone knows that.

29
00:01:43,234 --> 00:01:44,519
Batman?

30
00:01:44,706 --> 00:01:46,145
Detective comics
27.

31
00:01:46,338 --> 00:01:48,035
Spider-man?

32
00:01:48,226 --> 00:01:48,955
Spider-man
#1.

33
00:01:49,153 --> 00:01:50,084
Uh-uh!

34
00:01:50,274 --> 00:01:51,713
Oh, wait, wait. Uh...

35
00:01:51,906 --> 00:01:52,587
Amazing fantasy
15.

36
00:01:52,585 --> 00:01:54,119
Amazing fantasy
15.

37
00:01:54,313 --> 00:01:55,310
Golden age flash?

38
00:01:55,496 --> 00:01:56,743
Golden age flash...

39
00:01:58,664 --> 00:01:59,527
Uh,
flash comics
#1.

40
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,554
Silver age flash?

41
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:01,867
Showcase 4.

42
00:02:02,056 --> 00:02:03,620
Human torch?

43
00:02:03,817 --> 00:02:05,352
Uh,
fantastic four
#1.

44
00:02:05,545 --> 00:02:08,106
No! I'm taking about
the 1940's torch!

45
00:02:08,296 --> 00:02:09,543
Oh, uh...

46
00:02:09,736 --> 00:02:12,393
Marvel mystery
#1.

47
00:02:12,585 --> 00:02:13,419
Wonder woman?

48
00:02:13,609 --> 00:02:14,760
Wonder woman...

49
00:02:14,952 --> 00:02:16,592
Come on!
Wonder woman...

50
00:02:16,777 --> 00:02:17,668
Wonder woman--
sensation
1.

51
00:02:17,864 --> 00:02:18,660
Wrong!

52
00:02:18,856 --> 00:02:20,812
No, no, wait.

53
00:02:21,001 --> 00:02:21,356
I'm right.
It's definitely
sensation
1.

54
00:02:21,356 --> 00:02:24,013
I'm right.
It's definitely
sensation
1.

55
00:02:24,201 --> 00:02:25,284
No!

56
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,081
No!

57
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,874
It's not
wonder woman #1,
if that's--

58
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:29,995
what are you trying to do?
What are you trying to do?

59
00:02:30,184 --> 00:02:31,143
Insult me?

60
00:02:31,336 --> 00:02:32,841
Are you patronizing me,

61
00:02:33,032 --> 00:02:34,854
or are you just trying
to get yourself killed?

62
00:02:35,048 --> 00:02:36,324
Because if
you're doing that,

63
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,628
you're doing
a very... good... job.

64
00:02:50,478 --> 00:02:52,013
Our town?

65
00:02:52,206 --> 00:02:53,866
Um... it was normal.

66
00:02:54,063 --> 00:02:56,403
Walk down main street
on a busy Saturday,

67
00:02:56,591 --> 00:02:59,152
and you knew
almost everyone.

68
00:02:59,344 --> 00:03:01,588
Yep, a normal place.

69
00:03:01,775 --> 00:03:05,035
Normal stores
and normal people.

70
00:03:05,231 --> 00:03:07,025
And if it was
a little boring,

71
00:03:07,215 --> 00:03:09,421
no one seemed
to notice but me.

72
00:03:09,615 --> 00:03:12,080
The thing is, looking back,

73
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:15,407
I see it wasn't just normal.
It was real, too--

74
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,515
the real world,
where parents paid bills

75
00:03:18,703 --> 00:03:18,895
and kids worried
about football tryouts,

76
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:21,075
and kids worried
about football tryouts,

77
00:03:21,262 --> 00:03:25,933
where folks argued
whether the president
was a Saint or a sinner.

78
00:03:26,128 --> 00:03:29,101
Yep. Real.

79
00:03:29,295 --> 00:03:31,348
A little piece
of the world

80
00:03:31,535 --> 00:03:34,287
that my friends and me
didn't belong to.

81
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:37,836
See, we had
a world of our own.

82
00:03:38,031 --> 00:03:39,470
Why argue about
the president

83
00:03:39,664 --> 00:03:40,977
when you could argue
for the fate of earth

84
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:42,960
with galactus,
devourer of worlds?

85
00:03:43,151 --> 00:03:44,714
Why try out for football

86
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,359
when you could try out
for the X-Men?

87
00:03:46,543 --> 00:03:47,665
Nah, we didn't
do any of that.

88
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:48,792
Nah, we didn't
do any of that.

89
00:03:48,981 --> 00:03:50,486
But read enough comics,

90
00:03:50,677 --> 00:03:52,432
and it sure made
you feel like you did.

91
00:03:52,629 --> 00:03:54,681
Pathetic? Yeah, maybe.

92
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,855
But all you out there
with your daytime soaps,

93
00:03:57,045 --> 00:03:58,417
as far as I'm concerned,

94
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:01,011
you're in glass houses
throwing stones.

95
00:04:01,205 --> 00:04:03,641
That's me.
The name's Archie lake.

96
00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:07,282
I have to say
that I'm a bit different
from a lot of guys here.

97
00:04:07,478 --> 00:04:09,751
Not by choice,
my parents dying and all.

98
00:04:09,941 --> 00:04:11,869
I was alone.

99
00:04:12,053 --> 00:04:14,221
I had a single room
in a guesthouse.

100
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,445
Me, a bed, and more comic
boxes than I could count.

101
00:04:16,441 --> 00:04:18,771
Me, a bed, and more comic
boxes than I could count.

102
00:04:18,966 --> 00:04:20,405
Most of these guys
live at home.

103
00:04:20,596 --> 00:04:22,965
Why? No rent.

104
00:04:23,157 --> 00:04:25,401
And guess what that
extra dough gets spent on.

105
00:04:25,589 --> 00:04:27,152
And not just
new books every month,

106
00:04:27,349 --> 00:04:28,634
back issues, too,

107
00:04:28,821 --> 00:04:30,969
some costing
some serious dough.

108
00:04:31,157 --> 00:04:34,898
Which is
how and why things turned
a little crazy last year.

109
00:04:35,093 --> 00:04:38,133
Ah, and this
is Raymond macgillicuddy,

110
00:04:38,325 --> 00:04:40,214
owner of this
heaven on earth.

111
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:43,407
Getting in with Raymond
so he thought you were
worth talking to...

112
00:04:43,605 --> 00:04:45,216
Now that was
something to strive for.

113
00:04:45,212 --> 00:04:46,785
Now that was
something to strive for.

114
00:04:46,972 --> 00:04:48,276
When he thought
you were worth the effort,

115
00:04:48,476 --> 00:04:51,516
boy, those talks...
Stimulating.

116
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,597
About things
that really matter.

117
00:04:53,788 --> 00:04:55,581
If you want to fuck
a superheroine,

118
00:04:55,772 --> 00:04:57,728
the golden age canary
wins hands-down over
the modern version

119
00:04:57,915 --> 00:04:59,929
because of the fishnets.

120
00:05:00,124 --> 00:05:01,687
How about the valkyrie
from the
airboy
comic?

121
00:05:03,996 --> 00:05:05,722
Normally,
I'd agree with you, uh,

122
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:07,479
except for
the fact that she was
in suspended animation.

123
00:05:07,676 --> 00:05:09,891
She started screwing
the airboy in the 1940s,

124
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:11,706
then she comes out
of cold storage

125
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:12,533
and starts
screwing the new airboy
in the present?

126
00:05:12,732 --> 00:05:13,978
So?

127
00:05:13,983 --> 00:05:14,233
So?

128
00:05:14,427 --> 00:05:15,616
Well,
the new airboy
in the present

129
00:05:15,803 --> 00:05:16,762
is the son
of the original.

130
00:05:16,955 --> 00:05:18,269
That means the valkyrie

131
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,323
was doing
the father and the son.

132
00:05:19,516 --> 00:05:20,696
That is fucked up.

133
00:05:20,891 --> 00:05:22,368
Ah, ah, gentlemen,

134
00:05:22,556 --> 00:05:24,119
she was lost.
She was lonely.

135
00:05:24,316 --> 00:05:25,668
She was looking
for love, ok?

136
00:05:25,851 --> 00:05:26,772
Which of us,
under those conditions,

137
00:05:26,972 --> 00:05:27,836
wouldn't do the same?

138
00:05:31,451 --> 00:05:32,516
Yes.

139
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,539
And this is conan.

140
00:05:41,723 --> 00:05:42,750
He calls himself that
'cause he says

141
00:05:42,754 --> 00:05:43,493
he calls himself that
'cause he says

142
00:05:43,682 --> 00:05:46,242
Robert e. Howard,
the guy who created
conan the barbarian,

143
00:05:46,434 --> 00:05:47,556
was his great uncle,

144
00:05:47,746 --> 00:05:50,364
which I know is a crock.

145
00:05:50,562 --> 00:05:53,506
He's my Dr. doom,
my archfoe.

146
00:05:53,698 --> 00:05:55,328
Why?

147
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:56,807
He has more money than me,

148
00:05:56,994 --> 00:05:58,529
and he snags
the comics I can't.

149
00:05:58,722 --> 00:06:00,477
Plus, he's in
with Raymond, too.

150
00:06:00,674 --> 00:06:04,386
In fact, it was him
that started all
the craziness.

151
00:06:04,578 --> 00:06:06,525
Though I admit it seemed
innocent at the time

152
00:06:06,722 --> 00:06:09,350
when he opened his mouth,
sweet as pie, and said...

153
00:06:09,538 --> 00:06:10,948
Raymond,

154
00:06:11,138 --> 00:06:11,522
do you know a guy
named David cresswell?

155
00:06:11,526 --> 00:06:12,734
Do you know a guy
named David cresswell?

156
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,282
David cresswell...

157
00:06:14,466 --> 00:06:16,355
No, no. Should--should I?

158
00:06:18,146 --> 00:06:19,364
The new books come in?

159
00:06:19,554 --> 00:06:21,443
Hellboy
by mignola.

160
00:06:21,635 --> 00:06:23,016
Madman
by allred.

161
00:06:23,202 --> 00:06:23,969
The others,
they're the same old crap.

162
00:06:28,674 --> 00:06:30,209
Is that it, arch?

163
00:06:30,402 --> 00:06:31,333
Yeah, unless
my poster came in.

164
00:06:31,523 --> 00:06:33,057
Nope.

165
00:06:33,251 --> 00:06:34,728
Well, what about my
Alex Ross signed hardcover?

166
00:06:34,914 --> 00:06:36,228
Nope, again.

167
00:06:36,418 --> 00:06:39,487
You're not having
much luck today.

168
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:40,296
Ring me up.

169
00:06:40,297 --> 00:06:40,489
Ring me up.

170
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,023
What's going on?

171
00:06:42,217 --> 00:06:43,310
You seem kind of down.
You all right?

172
00:06:43,496 --> 00:06:45,098
I'm fine.

173
00:06:45,289 --> 00:06:46,881
You know, I just really
don't want to talk about it.

174
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,490
Why not?
You're
among friends.

175
00:06:50,185 --> 00:06:52,429
Um, do you remember
my cousin Sam?

176
00:06:52,617 --> 00:06:54,602
I brought him in once
when he was visiting.

177
00:06:54,793 --> 00:06:56,356
Well, it doesn't matter.

178
00:06:56,553 --> 00:06:58,538
Anyway, he got this job
driving a cab in New York,

179
00:06:58,729 --> 00:06:59,947
and he saved up
all this money,

180
00:07:00,136 --> 00:07:01,546
and now he's
going to Europe.

181
00:07:01,736 --> 00:07:02,532
Big deal. What's so
special about that?

182
00:07:04,744 --> 00:07:06,086
Europe isn't--isn't here.
It's--

183
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,047
it's there?

184
00:07:08,745 --> 00:07:09,071
Yeah, it's there.
It's somewhere.

185
00:07:09,068 --> 00:07:11,207
Yeah, it's there.
It's somewhere.

186
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,877
Why would you want
to leave town?

187
00:07:13,064 --> 00:07:14,819
Everything worth
having is right here.

188
00:07:15,016 --> 00:07:16,263
Raymond's store.

189
00:07:16,456 --> 00:07:17,521
Domino's pizza.

190
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:19,239
Very true.

191
00:07:19,432 --> 00:07:22,501
Ah, conan, be careful
of that, um, counter.

192
00:07:22,696 --> 00:07:24,077
The leg's broken.

193
00:07:24,265 --> 00:07:25,377
You going to fix it?

194
00:07:25,576 --> 00:07:26,477
I'll get
around to it.

195
00:07:26,664 --> 00:07:28,036
This, um...

196
00:07:28,232 --> 00:07:30,640
Cresswell character.
Should I know him?

197
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,167
He died.

198
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,307
My mom told me.
She met his mom.

199
00:07:34,505 --> 00:07:35,694
Oh, really?

200
00:07:35,881 --> 00:07:37,837
He was on old guy.
50, 55.

201
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:38,674
He was on old guy.
50, 55.

202
00:07:38,862 --> 00:07:40,522
Collected comic books
his whole life.

203
00:07:40,719 --> 00:07:42,743
I find that
hard to believe,

204
00:07:42,927 --> 00:07:45,325
seeing as I know every
serious comic-book collector
in the tri-county area,

205
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:47,658
and I've never heard
of this cresswell character.

206
00:07:47,854 --> 00:07:49,840
I meant he did until,
like, 5 years ago.

207
00:07:50,031 --> 00:07:51,604
That was before
you opened the store.

208
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:53,901
But he started buying
when he was 8 or 9.

209
00:07:54,095 --> 00:07:55,725
That's like 45 years
of collecting.

210
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,070
It's cool, huh?

211
00:07:59,055 --> 00:08:00,820
And he's deceased, you say?

212
00:08:01,007 --> 00:08:03,404
Too many burgers.
His heart.

213
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,680
Makes you proud
to be a comic fan.

214
00:08:05,871 --> 00:08:06,609
Where--where does
this mother live?

215
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:07,243
Where--where does
this mother live?

216
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:10,961
My mom met her
at the doctor's.

217
00:08:11,151 --> 00:08:12,878
She's like 100
or something,
extremely old.

218
00:08:13,071 --> 00:08:13,896
Who, your mom?

219
00:08:14,095 --> 00:08:15,543
Mrs. cresswell.

220
00:08:15,727 --> 00:08:17,098
Oh.

221
00:08:17,295 --> 00:08:18,830
They met at the doctor's
waiting room.

222
00:08:19,023 --> 00:08:20,270
They don't exchange
numbers or anything.

223
00:08:20,463 --> 00:08:21,815
My mom's hot.

224
00:08:21,999 --> 00:08:23,303
She's trying to date
the u. P. S. Guy,

225
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,172
so I can't see her
giving foot rubs

226
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,798
to some old woman,
you know?

227
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:33,068
C-conan, have you told
this to anyone else?

228
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:35,383
Uh-uh, only you.

229
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:35,861
Uh-uh, only you.

230
00:08:36,054 --> 00:08:37,819
Which wasn't exactly true.

231
00:08:38,006 --> 00:08:39,991
In fact,
it wasn't true at all.

232
00:08:40,182 --> 00:08:41,774
You remember that conan
was my archenemy?

233
00:08:41,973 --> 00:08:44,409
Well, Raymond had
his own Lex Luthor.

234
00:08:44,598 --> 00:08:47,418
Norman link
and his wife Judy

235
00:08:47,606 --> 00:08:49,744
had their own store
across town.

236
00:08:49,941 --> 00:08:52,310
They weren't
hard-core comic fans.

237
00:08:52,501 --> 00:08:55,379
Norman realized
that there was money
to be made in comics,

238
00:08:55,573 --> 00:08:57,721
especially if you
stocked a variety of cards

239
00:08:57,908 --> 00:08:59,443
and games
and stickers and crap

240
00:08:59,637 --> 00:09:01,938
that encouraged mothers
to bring in their kids.

241
00:09:02,133 --> 00:09:04,157
And that's why
Raymond hates them.

242
00:09:04,153 --> 00:09:04,565
And that's why
Raymond hates them.

243
00:09:04,758 --> 00:09:06,139
He feels there's
no real love for comics,

244
00:09:06,325 --> 00:09:08,886
neither Norman or his wife.

245
00:09:09,077 --> 00:09:12,789
Norman, in turn,
hates Raymond as
a professional rival.

246
00:09:12,981 --> 00:09:14,832
I think words
were even exchanged once

247
00:09:15,029 --> 00:09:16,564
when they were
at a stop sign

248
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:17,717
and they both thought
they had the right of way.

249
00:09:19,542 --> 00:09:21,172
I never go into the place.

250
00:09:21,366 --> 00:09:23,380
I have Raymond,
so why would I?

251
00:09:23,573 --> 00:09:24,858
But little did
ray and I know

252
00:09:25,045 --> 00:09:26,005
that conan...

253
00:09:26,197 --> 00:09:27,569
He liked to switch-hit.

254
00:09:27,765 --> 00:09:29,626
Which is why,
earlier that same day...

255
00:09:29,814 --> 00:09:31,895
Do you know a guy
named David cresswell?

256
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:40,989
And that's our cast
of four-color characters.

257
00:09:47,452 --> 00:09:49,878
No, wait.
There's one more.

258
00:09:51,676 --> 00:09:53,306
The reason
I almost forgot him

259
00:09:53,499 --> 00:09:56,578
is that
I didn't know this guy
when it all started.

260
00:09:56,764 --> 00:09:58,874
None of us did
except Raymond,

261
00:09:59,067 --> 00:10:01,695
and even his association
was from a long time ago.

262
00:10:01,695 --> 00:10:01,916
And even his association
was from a long time ago.

263
00:10:26,428 --> 00:10:27,483
Here he is...

264
00:10:27,676 --> 00:10:29,757
J. C. Carter.

265
00:10:29,948 --> 00:10:30,465
Though what
the j and the c stand for

266
00:10:30,466 --> 00:10:31,972
though what
the j and the c stand for

267
00:10:32,162 --> 00:10:34,847
are as mysterious
as the shadow.

268
00:10:35,042 --> 00:10:37,603
And as you can see
at this moment in time,

269
00:10:37,794 --> 00:10:40,288
the last thing
on his mind is comic books.

270
00:10:53,857 --> 00:10:54,625
Hello?

271
00:10:54,817 --> 00:10:55,844
Archie, hey.

272
00:10:56,034 --> 00:10:57,252
Hey, what are you doing?

273
00:10:57,442 --> 00:10:58,756
Babylon 5
is on.

274
00:10:58,946 --> 00:10:59,234
It's a repeat.

275
00:10:59,238 --> 00:10:59,909
It's a repeat.

276
00:11:00,098 --> 00:11:01,441
So?

277
00:11:01,633 --> 00:11:02,976
So don't you have
the week off work?

278
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:05,567
Yep, my boss
is making me take it.

279
00:11:05,762 --> 00:11:07,498
So what are
you going to do with it?

280
00:11:07,682 --> 00:11:09,149
I don't know.

281
00:11:09,347 --> 00:11:11,840
I'll probably re-bag
part of my collection

282
00:11:12,034 --> 00:11:14,086
and practice
how to make the perfect
grilled-cheese sandwich.

283
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:15,838
Hey, um, how'd you like
to spend tomorrow

284
00:11:16,034 --> 00:11:17,252
driving around with me?

285
00:11:19,842 --> 00:11:21,156
It's probably nothing.

286
00:11:21,346 --> 00:11:22,631
No, we can't afford it.

287
00:11:22,818 --> 00:11:24,065
Ok, well,
it's probably nothing,

288
00:11:24,258 --> 00:11:25,764
so don't worry about it.

289
00:11:25,955 --> 00:11:27,201
Well, why are
we bothering
if it's nothing?

290
00:11:27,394 --> 00:11:28,008
Because maybe
it is something.

291
00:11:28,009 --> 00:11:28,517
Because maybe
it is something.

292
00:11:28,713 --> 00:11:29,384
Then we
should worry.

293
00:11:29,577 --> 00:11:30,661
Can--

294
00:11:33,832 --> 00:11:34,887
Norman.

295
00:11:40,552 --> 00:11:42,087
Look, rumors like this one

296
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,815
drip down from
the clouds every few years.

297
00:11:45,097 --> 00:11:46,823
The big collection.

298
00:11:47,017 --> 00:11:49,990
You start hearing about
30, 40, 50 years of comic books

299
00:11:50,185 --> 00:11:52,016
kept pristine
in a basement or a warehouse.

300
00:11:52,201 --> 00:11:54,119
Usually it turns out
to be bullcrap.

301
00:11:54,312 --> 00:11:56,422
50 years
of so-called collecting

302
00:11:56,617 --> 00:11:56,780
turns out to be
a year of
Archie comics
in a cardboard box.

303
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,657
Turns out to be
a year of
Archie comics
in a cardboard box.

304
00:11:59,848 --> 00:12:01,354
Or there's
a few old comics,

305
00:12:01,545 --> 00:12:02,887
but the rats and the damp
have gotten to them.

306
00:12:03,081 --> 00:12:04,040
So why bother?

307
00:12:04,233 --> 00:12:05,547
Because you never know.

308
00:12:05,736 --> 00:12:07,818
There was a collection once.

309
00:12:08,008 --> 00:12:10,377
"The mile-high collection"
they call it now.

310
00:12:10,568 --> 00:12:12,611
The man that found it
built a mini-empire

311
00:12:12,808 --> 00:12:14,765
of comic-book stores
in Colorado and abouts.

312
00:12:14,953 --> 00:12:16,775
Norman,
we can't afford to be
buying collections.

313
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:18,446
Our quarterly taxes
are due next week.

314
00:12:18,633 --> 00:12:20,196
I know it.

315
00:12:20,393 --> 00:12:21,774
Say, you want pizza tonight?

316
00:12:24,361 --> 00:12:25,387
I want a baby.

317
00:12:27,822 --> 00:12:30,450
Gee, I don't know
if I can get that
as a topping, honey.

318
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:31,982
How about, uh, sausage?

319
00:12:32,175 --> 00:12:34,736
You bastard.

320
00:12:34,927 --> 00:12:36,624
Say, where's the phone book?

321
00:12:36,815 --> 00:12:39,405
The number for
the pizza store
is on the refrigerator.

322
00:12:39,599 --> 00:12:43,339
No, I'm thinking
there can't be too many
cresswells in town, right?

323
00:12:44,751 --> 00:12:46,804
Hey, I'm leaving.

324
00:12:46,991 --> 00:12:48,841
I want to take a bath.

325
00:12:49,038 --> 00:12:51,666
Ohh, nice.
Can I watch?

326
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:53,006
No, you can't.

327
00:12:53,199 --> 00:12:54,321
I want an hour
to myself,

328
00:12:54,322 --> 00:12:54,735
I want an hour
to myself,

329
00:12:54,928 --> 00:12:56,366
so don't come over yet.

330
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:57,777
Ok.

331
00:12:57,967 --> 00:12:59,214
So what are
you going to do?

332
00:12:59,406 --> 00:13:01,516
Finish up here.

333
00:13:01,711 --> 00:13:03,639
Oh, will you
grab something
on your way over?

334
00:13:03,823 --> 00:13:05,069
What?

335
00:13:05,262 --> 00:13:06,893
I'm making you
a meal tonight.

336
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:09,455
Macaroni and cheese?

337
00:13:09,647 --> 00:13:13,483
No,
I'm making a roasted
vegetable omelette,

338
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:15,539
and I got everything.
I just need, uh...

339
00:13:15,726 --> 00:13:18,642
Red and yellow
sweet peppers.

340
00:13:18,832 --> 00:13:19,915
Honey?
Huh?

341
00:13:20,111 --> 00:13:21,482
Can you get them?

342
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:22,859
Yeah, yeah.
Green and yellow peppers.

343
00:13:23,055 --> 00:13:23,094
No, red.

344
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:24,081
No, red.

345
00:13:24,277 --> 00:13:25,821
Red and yellow peppers.

346
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:27,732
Ok, I'll get 'em.

347
00:13:27,925 --> 00:13:28,951
Thanks.

348
00:13:31,605 --> 00:13:33,044
Oh, and, uh,

349
00:13:33,237 --> 00:13:36,335
Cheryl said that she saw
Tony here earlier,

350
00:13:36,534 --> 00:13:38,557
but I must have
been backstage.

351
00:13:38,741 --> 00:13:41,398
I've been here hours.
I haven't seen him.

352
00:13:41,589 --> 00:13:44,207
Just be careful,
all right?

353
00:13:44,405 --> 00:13:45,269
Right.

354
00:13:45,461 --> 00:13:46,583
I love you, booby.

355
00:13:48,054 --> 00:13:49,233
Hey!

356
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:51,289
don't you love me?

357
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:56,819
You know it, honeysuckle.

358
00:14:21,436 --> 00:14:22,884
Mr. Carter?

359
00:14:25,052 --> 00:14:26,261
Been a while.

360
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:29,154
Oh, hi, Tony.
How you doing?

361
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:32,025
How or who,
which did you say?

362
00:14:32,219 --> 00:14:33,274
How.

363
00:14:33,467 --> 00:14:34,714
Ah...

364
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:36,509
'Cause if you'd
asked me who,

365
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,688
then I'd have to tell you
that I'm not doing anyone.

366
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,635
But you're doing
someone, though.

367
00:14:40,828 --> 00:14:43,743
Come on, Tony.

368
00:14:43,931 --> 00:14:46,271
We've been
through all this.

369
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:49,404
Your ex-wife
is just that--
your ex.

370
00:14:49,407 --> 00:14:49,983
Your ex-wife
is just that--
your ex.

371
00:14:50,172 --> 00:14:51,351
I didn't
break you guys up.

372
00:14:51,548 --> 00:14:53,533
You were around.

373
00:14:55,451 --> 00:14:56,218
Who are these guys?

374
00:14:56,411 --> 00:14:58,914
My friends.

375
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:02,295
Didn't bring
any of your buddies?

376
00:15:02,492 --> 00:15:04,861
No, I'm, uh...

377
00:15:05,051 --> 00:15:07,420
More of a loner.

378
00:15:36,865 --> 00:15:39,551
don't hurt me.
Please, Carter.

379
00:15:39,745 --> 00:15:42,085
I'll leave you alone.
I promise. I promise.

380
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,442
Oh, yeah?
Well, what makes you think

381
00:15:44,642 --> 00:15:46,023
I don't enjoy
our time together, huh?

382
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:46,949
Hmm?

383
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:47,429
Hmm?

384
00:15:47,618 --> 00:15:48,989
You fuck!

385
00:16:02,018 --> 00:16:03,840
Now,
the new day didn't begin

386
00:16:04,034 --> 00:16:07,851
with a glorious dawn
marking the start
of some grand adventure.

387
00:16:08,034 --> 00:16:09,914
There was one cresswell
listed in the phone book,

388
00:16:10,114 --> 00:16:12,195
no Mr. or Mrs.
alongside it,

389
00:16:12,386 --> 00:16:14,793
so we didn't know
what we'd find
when we got there.

390
00:16:14,978 --> 00:16:15,716
Not me. Not Raymond...

391
00:16:15,721 --> 00:16:17,610
Not me. Not Raymond...

392
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,044
Not Norman.

393
00:16:22,472 --> 00:16:24,812
M-m-Mrs. cresswell?

394
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,947
They're around the back.

395
00:16:27,145 --> 00:16:28,200
What are?

396
00:16:28,393 --> 00:16:29,841
My bottles.

397
00:16:30,025 --> 00:16:32,164
It's about time the city
came and got 'em.

398
00:16:33,705 --> 00:16:35,306
Your bottles?

399
00:16:35,497 --> 00:16:38,087
Yes, I've even
sorted them into
clear and colored.

400
00:16:38,281 --> 00:16:39,979
I've done all
the work for you.

401
00:16:40,168 --> 00:16:41,961
A little
old lady like me,

402
00:16:42,153 --> 00:16:44,071
you ought to be
ashamed of yourselves.

403
00:16:44,265 --> 00:16:44,495
No, I'm--I'm not here
for your bottles,
Mrs. cresswell,

404
00:16:44,492 --> 00:16:47,149
no, I'm--I'm not here
for your bottles,
Mrs. cresswell,

405
00:16:47,337 --> 00:16:48,545
I'm not with the city.

406
00:16:48,744 --> 00:16:50,509
I--I had a, uh,

407
00:16:50,696 --> 00:16:52,518
a city job once, but...

408
00:16:52,713 --> 00:16:53,998
I was actually--
I was wondering

409
00:16:54,184 --> 00:16:55,527
if I might have
a word with you.

410
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,444
Look, if you're
a jehovah's witness,

411
00:16:58,633 --> 00:16:59,976
you're wasting
your time,

412
00:17:00,168 --> 00:17:01,569
because I've made
my peace with god,

413
00:17:01,768 --> 00:17:03,370
and I don't
want to change

414
00:17:03,561 --> 00:17:05,296
the way I say
good morning
and good night to him

415
00:17:05,481 --> 00:17:07,715
at this late date.

416
00:17:07,912 --> 00:17:10,281
No, no, no. I'm not here
about god, either.

417
00:17:10,472 --> 00:17:12,678
Then what
can I do for you?

418
00:17:12,873 --> 00:17:13,266
Well, you, um...

419
00:17:13,263 --> 00:17:16,303
Well, you, um...

420
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:18,930
You had a son, right?

421
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,641
He was 65

422
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,045
and still living
with his mom.

423
00:17:24,238 --> 00:17:26,099
He enjoyed
his life, though.

424
00:17:26,287 --> 00:17:27,764
He never went out.

425
00:17:27,951 --> 00:17:29,677
Not after
he left his job.

426
00:17:29,871 --> 00:17:31,885
Ah, a pleasant
retirement nonetheless.

427
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,998
No, disability.

428
00:17:34,191 --> 00:17:37,490
He slipped at work.

429
00:17:37,678 --> 00:17:40,143
He said there was
grease on the floor.

430
00:17:40,335 --> 00:17:42,032
I think
he was just so fat
that he fell over.

431
00:17:42,034 --> 00:17:42,859
I think
he was just so fat
that he fell over.

432
00:17:47,407 --> 00:17:50,159
But don't get me wrong.
don't get me wrong.

433
00:17:50,351 --> 00:17:51,732
I loved my boy.

434
00:17:51,918 --> 00:17:54,249
I know you did.
So he--he stayed here?

435
00:17:54,447 --> 00:17:57,679
He watched videos,
and he ate ribs
and apple pie,

436
00:17:57,871 --> 00:17:58,964
and that was his life.

437
00:17:59,151 --> 00:18:00,110
Hmm.

438
00:18:00,303 --> 00:18:02,154
I came down one morning

439
00:18:02,351 --> 00:18:04,182
and found him dead
from the night before.

440
00:18:06,575 --> 00:18:09,136
Tragic. What a shame.

441
00:18:11,637 --> 00:18:14,994
Yeah, I can see
the tears in your eyes.

442
00:18:17,877 --> 00:18:18,740
Now, what do you want?

443
00:18:21,781 --> 00:18:23,766
Dave--David was
a collector, right?

444
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:24,792
Yeah.

445
00:18:24,981 --> 00:18:26,266
Comic books?

446
00:18:26,453 --> 00:18:27,633
Yeah, most of his life.

447
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,815
Do you still have them?

448
00:18:30,006 --> 00:18:32,758
Sure, sure. I have
everything of David's.

449
00:18:32,949 --> 00:18:35,155
See, I'm a bit
of a collector myself,

450
00:18:35,349 --> 00:18:38,648
and I'd actually
might be interested
in buying them from you.

451
00:18:38,837 --> 00:18:39,576
Well, I'm sorry,
but you see,
they're not for sale.

452
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:41,878
Well, I'm sorry,
but you see,
they're not for sale.

453
00:18:42,069 --> 00:18:45,042
Oh, well, I'm sure
we could come to some sort
of
understanding.

454
00:18:45,237 --> 00:18:46,676
Not unless
you understand

455
00:18:46,869 --> 00:18:48,663
that I'm not interested.

456
00:18:50,517 --> 00:18:52,818
Well, could I at least
just see what he had?

457
00:18:53,013 --> 00:18:55,602
No. I don't see
the point of it,
you know?

458
00:18:55,797 --> 00:18:57,849
I-I'd like to know...

459
00:18:58,037 --> 00:18:59,955
For my own peace of mind.

460
00:19:04,341 --> 00:19:06,585
Well...

461
00:19:06,773 --> 00:19:08,183
Never let it be said

462
00:19:08,373 --> 00:19:10,550
that I denied anybody
his peace of mind.

463
00:19:10,748 --> 00:19:11,679
Come on.

464
00:19:38,652 --> 00:19:42,584
No humidity.
No light.

465
00:19:42,779 --> 00:19:45,148
That's good.

466
00:19:58,139 --> 00:19:59,357
Oh, god.

467
00:19:59,547 --> 00:20:01,053
Goddamn it,
there he goes.

468
00:20:01,244 --> 00:20:03,546
Ohh, this
doesn't look good.

469
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,303
Oh, goddamn it.

470
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:05,893
Shit!

471
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:06,274
Shit!

472
00:20:06,467 --> 00:20:07,493
Fuck! Shit!

473
00:20:08,802 --> 00:20:10,173
Goddamn it!

474
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:12,163
Jesus Christ!
I bet you he found her!

475
00:20:12,354 --> 00:20:13,793
I see--
look at his face!

476
00:20:13,986 --> 00:20:15,300
I bet you that
son of a bitch
found her!

477
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:16,449
You know what
this about, Archie?

478
00:20:16,642 --> 00:20:18,119
This is about that house

479
00:20:18,306 --> 00:20:19,227
being a quarter of a mile
closer to his shop

480
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:20,452
than my fucking shop!

481
00:20:20,641 --> 00:20:22,147
A quarter of a fucking mile!

482
00:20:22,338 --> 00:20:24,103
What are you
going to do?

483
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:25,181
I don't know!

484
00:20:31,331 --> 00:20:32,156
Mrs. cresswell?

485
00:20:32,354 --> 00:20:33,610
Yes.

486
00:20:33,794 --> 00:20:34,657
Hi. You just
saw my colleague?

487
00:20:34,662 --> 00:20:35,486
Hi. You just
saw my colleague?

488
00:20:35,682 --> 00:20:37,159
Your colleague?

489
00:20:37,346 --> 00:20:40,607
My--I mean
my partner, um, Norman.

490
00:20:40,801 --> 00:20:42,432
He said I should,
uh, introduce myself.

491
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,486
I don't know why.

492
00:20:44,674 --> 00:20:46,208
I told him I wasn't
interested in selling them.

493
00:20:47,425 --> 00:20:48,864
The comic books?

494
00:20:49,058 --> 00:20:51,110
Well, what else
would I be talking about?

495
00:20:51,298 --> 00:20:53,120
Oh, well, um...

496
00:20:53,314 --> 00:20:55,999
See, Norman, uh, thought
I should--I should
take a look at them.

497
00:20:56,194 --> 00:20:58,985
Look, I told him,
and I'm telling you

498
00:20:59,171 --> 00:21:01,309
I don't want to sell
my son's things.

499
00:21:01,506 --> 00:21:03,434
Oh, and I'm--
I'm sorry for your loss,

500
00:21:03,433 --> 00:21:03,941
oh, and I'm--
I'm sorry for your loss,

501
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:05,805
but could I look at
the comic books anyway?

502
00:21:05,992 --> 00:21:08,198
Your partner
already saw them.

503
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,636
I know, ok, but see,

504
00:21:10,825 --> 00:21:13,031
he--I'm--he's not me.
And I'm...

505
00:21:13,225 --> 00:21:14,443
I'm a collector,

506
00:21:14,632 --> 00:21:17,318
and your son
was a collector.

507
00:21:17,512 --> 00:21:20,073
And I have so much
respect for...

508
00:21:20,265 --> 00:21:22,634
Uh... collecting.

509
00:21:24,489 --> 00:21:25,764
Please?

510
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,451
Oh, well...

511
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,722
It's nice to hear
a gentleman say please.

512
00:21:31,912 --> 00:21:32,200
Come on in.

513
00:21:32,204 --> 00:21:33,384
Come on in.

514
00:22:59,701 --> 00:23:01,053
Did you see them?

515
00:23:18,164 --> 00:23:20,178
They're beautiful!

516
00:23:23,765 --> 00:23:25,261
They're beautiful.

517
00:23:25,461 --> 00:23:27,293
She won't sell,
you said. The end.

518
00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:27,538
She won't sell,
you said. The end.

519
00:23:27,733 --> 00:23:28,596
No.

520
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:30,286
That's it, Norman.

521
00:23:30,485 --> 00:23:32,029
You had no right
to offer her our life savings.

522
00:23:32,213 --> 00:23:33,873
We could offer her more.

523
00:23:34,069 --> 00:23:34,904
We could take out a loan.

524
00:23:35,093 --> 00:23:36,561
Are you high?

525
00:23:36,757 --> 00:23:37,947
Maybe we could sell
that car. Who needs it?

526
00:23:38,133 --> 00:23:39,092
Get something cheaper.

527
00:23:39,285 --> 00:23:40,657
This is fucking crazy.

528
00:23:40,853 --> 00:23:42,398
don't swear.
I hate it when you swear.

529
00:23:42,582 --> 00:23:44,529
Oh, well, I swear I'll
walk out that fucking door

530
00:23:44,725 --> 00:23:46,010
if you keep this up!

531
00:23:46,197 --> 00:23:47,252
These collections
have pedigree.

532
00:23:47,445 --> 00:23:49,871
We could charge more,

533
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:52,410
4, 5 times more
than
the comic book
price guide
says.

534
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,899
Old lady cresswell
is sitting on a gold mine.

535
00:23:55,093 --> 00:23:56,062
She don't even know it.

536
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,115
She don't even know it.

537
00:23:57,308 --> 00:24:00,444
I saw the complete runs
of marvel's and DC's,

538
00:24:00,636 --> 00:24:02,266
some of them going back
to the golden age,

539
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,771
and all of them perfect.

540
00:24:04,955 --> 00:24:07,286
All the ecs,
all the early
showcases

541
00:24:07,484 --> 00:24:08,769
with the origin
of the flash,

542
00:24:08,955 --> 00:24:10,231
the green lantern,
and the atom.

543
00:24:10,427 --> 00:24:12,058
Look...

544
00:24:12,251 --> 00:24:13,987
The guide says,

545
00:24:14,171 --> 00:24:19,379
"$32, 000. $5, 500.
And $1, 500."

546
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,923
We could charge
4 times that,

547
00:24:21,116 --> 00:24:22,420
and that's
just 3 comic books, honey.

548
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,097
The guy had thousands.

549
00:24:24,284 --> 00:24:24,830
I'm serious. Thousands.

550
00:24:24,831 --> 00:24:26,433
I'm serious. Thousands.

551
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:29,689
Here.
Bedtime reading for you.

552
00:24:29,883 --> 00:24:31,322
Yeah, I'll kill you
with it in your sleep,

553
00:24:31,516 --> 00:24:32,791
or I'll hit you
over the head.

554
00:24:32,988 --> 00:24:35,031
Look, it's a gamble,
I admit it.

555
00:24:35,228 --> 00:24:37,146
But if it pays off,

556
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:40,668
we can expand.
You can have a kid.

557
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:43,555
We could have it all.

558
00:25:43,873 --> 00:25:45,024
Norman.

559
00:25:45,218 --> 00:25:45,889
Norman,
honey, wake up.

560
00:25:46,082 --> 00:25:47,300
What?

561
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:48,286
We have to get
those comics.

562
00:25:48,482 --> 00:25:49,479
What happened?

563
00:25:57,128 --> 00:26:00,523
Look,
man driving bus,
not funny.

564
00:26:00,712 --> 00:26:03,656
Monkey driving bus,
chuckles a-plenty.

565
00:26:03,848 --> 00:26:05,670
Man icing cake,
no laughs.

566
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:07,878
Monkey icing cake,
big laughs.

567
00:26:08,073 --> 00:26:09,099
Man walking dog...

568
00:26:09,289 --> 00:26:11,523
Hey.

569
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,389
What's with you?
Why aren't you
joining in?

570
00:26:13,576 --> 00:26:15,081
You usually like
to take part in
this kind of stuff.

571
00:26:15,272 --> 00:26:16,519
Provocative monkeys?

572
00:26:16,713 --> 00:26:17,960
Yeah.
I don't know.

573
00:26:18,152 --> 00:26:19,917
Excuse me
if I'm wrong. Um...

574
00:26:19,916 --> 00:26:20,712
Excuse me
if I'm wrong. Um...

575
00:26:20,905 --> 00:26:22,382
Weren't you the one who
tried to start the campaign

576
00:26:22,569 --> 00:26:24,295
to get linda Hamilton
nominated for an Oscar

577
00:26:24,489 --> 00:26:25,477
for
Terminator ii?

578
00:26:25,672 --> 00:26:26,957
No, that was me.

579
00:26:27,145 --> 00:26:28,171
I love that movie.

580
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,761
Me, too.

581
00:26:32,169 --> 00:26:34,250
No, I was--
I was just thinkin'.

582
00:26:34,441 --> 00:26:37,510
About the comics
at Mrs. cresswell's?

583
00:26:37,705 --> 00:26:40,036
Um, no.

584
00:26:40,232 --> 00:26:42,122
Just, like,
about the town.

585
00:26:42,312 --> 00:26:43,530
What about it?

586
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:47,435
You know--nothin'.

587
00:26:47,625 --> 00:26:48,689
Yeah, you know, lately

588
00:26:48,687 --> 00:26:50,222
yeah, you know, lately

589
00:26:50,415 --> 00:26:52,238
a lotta stuff's
been eatin' at me, too,

590
00:26:52,431 --> 00:26:54,800
drivin' me crazy.

591
00:27:10,351 --> 00:27:11,310
Booby.

592
00:27:11,503 --> 00:27:13,517
Oh, hey, honey.

593
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:15,091
I was just thinkin'
about you.

594
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:16,210
Oh, yeah?

595
00:27:16,399 --> 00:27:17,454
Warm thoughts, I hope.

596
00:27:17,458 --> 00:27:19,444
Warm thoughts, I hope.

597
00:27:19,631 --> 00:27:21,223
Is there any other kind?

598
00:27:21,423 --> 00:27:22,325
Uh-uh.

599
00:27:22,511 --> 00:27:24,208
I brought you lunch.

600
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:27,976
How's it goin' in here?

601
00:27:28,175 --> 00:27:31,157
Well...

602
00:27:31,342 --> 00:27:34,383
At least
another 4 months.

603
00:27:34,575 --> 00:27:36,493
Really?
Why that long?

604
00:27:36,687 --> 00:27:41,204
See that? It's damp.

605
00:27:41,391 --> 00:27:43,434
Wall's rotten
with it.

606
00:27:43,631 --> 00:27:46,230
That's work
I hadn't counted on.

607
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:47,409
That's work
I hadn't counted on.

608
00:27:47,605 --> 00:27:49,974
Hmm.

609
00:27:50,166 --> 00:27:54,040
Still I, uh...

610
00:27:54,229 --> 00:27:56,118
Wish I didn't have
to sell this place.

611
00:27:59,605 --> 00:28:01,073
You know, selling them
when they're fixed up

612
00:28:01,269 --> 00:28:02,516
feels good, usually,

613
00:28:02,709 --> 00:28:05,624
but I don't know.
This time...

614
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:12,690
I kinda feel like
I'm losin' somethin',
you know?

615
00:28:12,885 --> 00:28:15,005
Really, baby?
Why this place?

616
00:28:15,001 --> 00:28:16,113
Really, baby?
Why this place?

617
00:28:16,309 --> 00:28:20,088
I don't know.

618
00:28:20,276 --> 00:28:22,617
It feels right, somehow.

619
00:28:25,845 --> 00:28:28,722
Is this room
gonna be the den?

620
00:28:28,917 --> 00:28:30,107
If I have to sell it,
sure.

621
00:28:30,294 --> 00:28:35,252
But I was figuring...

622
00:28:35,445 --> 00:28:39,156
That if I put insulation
in the walls...

623
00:28:41,397 --> 00:28:43,776
It'd make a pretty cool
studio for your music.

624
00:28:43,772 --> 00:28:44,702
It'd make a pretty cool
studio for your music.

625
00:28:44,891 --> 00:28:46,550
What do you think?

626
00:28:49,787 --> 00:28:51,264
Well, I mean, you been
bustin' your ass

627
00:28:51,452 --> 00:28:52,603
to afford
recording equipment.

628
00:28:52,796 --> 00:28:56,028
I mean, at least now

629
00:28:56,219 --> 00:28:58,300
we have somewhere
to put it, right?

630
00:29:00,284 --> 00:29:02,106
We?
Mm-hmm.

631
00:29:05,051 --> 00:29:08,446
You and me, baby...

632
00:29:08,636 --> 00:29:10,679
Till death.

633
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,197
Mrs. cresswell.

634
00:29:20,636 --> 00:29:22,237
Um... maybe.

635
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,153
I'm Judy.

636
00:29:24,347 --> 00:29:28,442
Well, I'm happy
for you, darling.

637
00:29:31,548 --> 00:29:33,111
Oh, no. Judy.
Norman's Judy?

638
00:29:33,308 --> 00:29:36,540
The guy interested
in your comic books.

639
00:29:36,731 --> 00:29:38,237
You mean my son's.

640
00:29:38,428 --> 00:29:41,314
Mm-hmm. That's right.
Your son's comic books.

641
00:29:41,314 --> 00:29:41,698
Mm-hmm. That's right.
Your son's comic books.

642
00:29:41,891 --> 00:29:44,097
Um, I was wondering
if we could talk
about that.

643
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:46,343
I wasn't very interested

644
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:48,994
in talking to your
husband about them.

645
00:29:49,186 --> 00:29:50,654
Right. And I was
just thinking that

646
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:51,780
maybe it was the way
my Norman brought it up

647
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:53,409
that you didn't like.

648
00:29:53,603 --> 00:29:55,012
You know,
men.

649
00:29:55,201 --> 00:29:57,062
And then there was
the real nervous one.

650
00:29:57,251 --> 00:30:00,291
He said he was
with you, too.

651
00:30:00,482 --> 00:30:02,112
He's a liar,

652
00:30:02,306 --> 00:30:05,030
a terrible,
terrible liar.

653
00:30:05,218 --> 00:30:07,424
A bit touched, too,
if you ask me.

654
00:30:07,618 --> 00:30:08,836
So, listen, let's talk.

655
00:30:09,026 --> 00:30:10,081
I mean, surely
there's a way

656
00:30:10,086 --> 00:30:10,306
I mean, surely
there's a way

657
00:30:10,498 --> 00:30:12,742
we can come
to an understanding.

658
00:30:12,738 --> 00:30:14,302
Just us girls, huh?

659
00:30:14,498 --> 00:30:16,455
That's right. Us girls.

660
00:30:17,826 --> 00:30:20,291
Ok.

661
00:30:21,922 --> 00:30:23,015
I--I love the garden.

662
00:30:23,202 --> 00:30:24,229
I'm the gardener.
Oh, yeah?

663
00:30:24,418 --> 00:30:26,557
I am the gardener.
Yeah.

664
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,983
I all but went down
on the old bitch.

665
00:30:33,218 --> 00:30:34,532
Nice goin'.

666
00:30:34,722 --> 00:30:35,490
You know, I offered her
15 grand?

667
00:30:35,682 --> 00:30:36,862
Yeah?

668
00:30:37,058 --> 00:30:38,602
And then I upped it
to 20.

669
00:30:38,786 --> 00:30:38,853
20 grand? Do we--
do we even have
that much?

670
00:30:38,857 --> 00:30:40,132
20 grand? Do we--
do we even have
that much?

671
00:30:40,329 --> 00:30:42,055
I mean, by that point,
I didn't care.

672
00:30:42,249 --> 00:30:44,138
20 grand will keep
this rusted old woman
until she dies,

673
00:30:44,329 --> 00:30:46,439
and she still
turned it down.

674
00:30:46,633 --> 00:30:49,577
All right. It's ok.
Good job, sweetie.

675
00:30:49,768 --> 00:30:50,947
Good try.
Uhh!

676
00:30:51,145 --> 00:30:51,855
We'll figure
somethin' out.

677
00:30:52,041 --> 00:30:53,259
Yeah.

678
00:30:53,449 --> 00:30:55,012
It's ok.

679
00:30:55,208 --> 00:30:56,580
Hey, it's ok.
You did a good job.

680
00:30:56,776 --> 00:30:58,215
Mm-hmm.

681
00:30:58,408 --> 00:30:59,175
I mean,
at least we're
workin' together

682
00:30:59,368 --> 00:31:00,835
like a team.

683
00:31:01,033 --> 00:31:02,701
There was a time
when I didn't even
think

684
00:31:02,888 --> 00:31:04,586
our marriage was
gonna last anymore,

685
00:31:04,777 --> 00:31:06,762
because we didn't
have anything
in common.

686
00:31:06,952 --> 00:31:07,623
Hey...

687
00:31:07,628 --> 00:31:09,863
Hey...

688
00:31:10,057 --> 00:31:12,397
The way I feel
about you now,

689
00:31:12,584 --> 00:31:14,474
I know that we're
gonna make it.

690
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:17,187
I do.

691
00:31:17,384 --> 00:31:19,341
You know what
I feel like?

692
00:31:19,528 --> 00:31:21,542
Closin' early?

693
00:31:21,736 --> 00:31:23,750
That's it, tiger.
Talk dirty.

694
00:31:25,672 --> 00:31:27,111
So,
she wouldn't sell?

695
00:31:27,305 --> 00:31:28,676
Uh-uh.

696
00:31:28,873 --> 00:31:31,951
Not to me.
Not to Norman.

697
00:31:32,137 --> 00:31:35,398
What are you
gonna do?

698
00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:36,398
I don't know, arch.
All right?

699
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:37,675
I don't know, arch.
All right?

700
00:31:37,871 --> 00:31:40,365
Norman and his wife
are gonna come at her
with more money.

701
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,314
I know that.
More money, and then
more fuckin' money,

702
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:43,440
'cause that's--
that's their style.

703
00:31:43,631 --> 00:31:44,974
I know that much.

704
00:31:45,167 --> 00:31:48,399
Man, you gotta
fight fire with fire.

705
00:31:48,591 --> 00:31:50,097
Fight fire with fire?

706
00:31:50,286 --> 00:31:51,245
Who are you,
the punisher,
all of a sudden?

707
00:31:51,439 --> 00:31:52,820
I don't have any money.

708
00:31:53,007 --> 00:31:55,241
I'm broke.
You know that.

709
00:31:55,439 --> 00:31:56,782
No, I don't.

710
00:31:58,096 --> 00:32:00,944
I guess you wouldn't.

711
00:32:01,135 --> 00:32:03,858
Arch, I don't have
a nickel to my name.

712
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,169
I'm hangin' on
by the short hairs.

713
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:05,583
I'm hangin' on
by the short hairs.

714
00:32:05,776 --> 00:32:07,377
The day-to-day
comic business
is in recession.

715
00:32:07,566 --> 00:32:10,539
Last year was miserable.
This year is gonna be worse.

716
00:32:10,735 --> 00:32:12,365
Thank god
I don't have a house.

717
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:14,295
I woulda lost it
by now.

718
00:32:14,479 --> 00:32:16,685
But you have
loyal customers.

719
00:32:16,878 --> 00:32:18,509
Yeah, so does
McDonalds, ok?

720
00:32:18,702 --> 00:32:20,784
But they just got
a couple billion more
than I do.

721
00:32:20,974 --> 00:32:23,247
You know the counter?

722
00:32:23,439 --> 00:32:24,974
It's gonna cost
400 bucks

723
00:32:25,167 --> 00:32:26,577
to replace
or repair that.

724
00:32:26,767 --> 00:32:28,589
I can't--I--I--
I don't have 400 bucks.

725
00:32:28,783 --> 00:32:30,126
You know how I was
on the roof last week?

726
00:32:30,318 --> 00:32:32,658
The next heavy rain,
buckets aplenty

727
00:32:32,847 --> 00:32:33,941
on the floor,
my friend.
Buckets aplenty.

728
00:32:33,942 --> 00:32:35,025
On the floor,
my friend.
Buckets aplenty.

729
00:32:37,782 --> 00:32:41,014
Well, why don't you
just go to Norman,

730
00:32:41,205 --> 00:32:43,133
and maybe you guys
could work
something out.

731
00:32:47,286 --> 00:32:48,734
No--uh--
I don't know.

732
00:32:48,918 --> 00:32:50,894
Man, give it a shot.

733
00:32:57,621 --> 00:33:00,182
Hello.
I'm Raymond macgillicuddy.

734
00:33:00,374 --> 00:33:02,263
Hello. Um...

735
00:33:02,454 --> 00:33:02,713
Um... total--

736
00:33:02,713 --> 00:33:04,151
um... total--

737
00:33:04,341 --> 00:33:06,739
hello, sworn enemy.

738
00:33:06,933 --> 00:33:08,275
That's a lovely dress
that you're wearing.

739
00:33:08,469 --> 00:33:10,166
That--
that's a lovely dress.

740
00:33:10,357 --> 00:33:11,738
How do you do?

741
00:33:11,925 --> 00:33:13,748
You're very lovely.
And your name is?

742
00:33:13,941 --> 00:33:15,217
I'd like to do
some business.

743
00:33:19,381 --> 00:33:20,148
Waa!

744
00:33:24,949 --> 00:33:27,471
Oh, baby,
the thought
of finding it--

745
00:33:27,669 --> 00:33:30,613
unh--this treasure--
it's exciting.

746
00:33:30,805 --> 00:33:31,486
It makes me wet.

747
00:33:31,484 --> 00:33:32,664
It makes me wet.

748
00:33:32,859 --> 00:33:34,749
It turns me on.
The bed!

749
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:36,321
No, no, no, no, no.
We don't need a bed.

750
00:33:36,507 --> 00:33:38,042
That's right.
We don't need a bed.

751
00:33:38,236 --> 00:33:39,454
Up against the wall.
I love it that way.

752
00:33:39,644 --> 00:33:40,891
You do?

753
00:33:41,084 --> 00:33:42,494
Oh, fuck me
against the wall.

754
00:33:42,684 --> 00:33:44,093
I love being fucked
up against the wall.

755
00:33:44,283 --> 00:33:46,201
We never did it
against the wall before.

756
00:33:46,396 --> 00:33:48,986
Shut up. You're
thinking too much.

757
00:33:49,179 --> 00:33:50,234
Come on.

758
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:52,030
Oh!
Make me come.

759
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,601
I know you can
make me come.
I can do it.

760
00:33:53,787 --> 00:33:54,651
You can make me
come this time.

761
00:33:54,843 --> 00:33:56,253
You hang in there.

762
00:33:56,444 --> 00:33:57,624
You better hang in there!
Hang in there!

763
00:33:57,819 --> 00:33:58,874
Who's my fucker?

764
00:33:59,068 --> 00:34:00,257
Who's my little fucker?

765
00:34:00,443 --> 00:34:01,786
I'm your fucker.
You're my fucker!

766
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:04,214
I wanna be
your little fucker.

767
00:34:09,436 --> 00:34:11,613
Hi. I'm Raymond
macgillicuddy.

768
00:34:13,979 --> 00:34:16,607
It was, uh, not easy.

769
00:34:16,796 --> 00:34:18,138
We've been across town
for so long

770
00:34:18,332 --> 00:34:20,058
and never formally
really--

771
00:34:20,252 --> 00:34:21,537
well,
it was a long walk--

772
00:34:21,723 --> 00:34:23,507
just--just get
to your proposal.

773
00:34:23,708 --> 00:34:25,952
Ok, ok.

774
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,415
Well, I think I've
thought of a way

775
00:34:27,612 --> 00:34:29,022
in which both of us
can benefit

776
00:34:29,026 --> 00:34:29,285
in which both of us
can benefit

777
00:34:29,473 --> 00:34:30,787
from the lady's
collection--

778
00:34:30,978 --> 00:34:32,762
both?

779
00:34:32,962 --> 00:34:34,315
Uh, all 3 of us.
Mm-hmm.

780
00:34:34,499 --> 00:34:36,350
Both parties is what
I meant to say.

781
00:34:36,546 --> 00:34:38,982
How?
Well, um...

782
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:40,513
I don't have
any money,

783
00:34:40,706 --> 00:34:42,403
and I can't
buy the books,
whoa.

784
00:34:42,594 --> 00:34:44,637
What'd you just say?
No money?

785
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:46,655
Yes, I'm coming
to you honestly.

786
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:50,658
I'm com--I'm
completely broke.

787
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:52,797
B-but what I--

788
00:34:52,994 --> 00:34:55,909
what I offer is
a knowledge
and an expertise

789
00:34:56,098 --> 00:34:57,604
in the books
themselves.

790
00:34:57,794 --> 00:34:57,798
I know comics.
I know the people.

791
00:34:57,798 --> 00:34:59,265
I know comics.
I know the people.

792
00:34:59,459 --> 00:35:01,127
I know the real
value of the books.

793
00:35:01,314 --> 00:35:04,575
And you--you can make
a tremendous amount
of money,

794
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,017
and I'll help you,

795
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:08,675
and I don't even want
a penny.

796
00:35:08,867 --> 00:35:09,634
Now I've heard
everything.

797
00:35:09,827 --> 00:35:11,237
Well, wait.

798
00:35:11,426 --> 00:35:12,998
Have you ever been
to San Diego?

799
00:35:13,186 --> 00:35:14,011
Have you been
to San Diego--
to the convention?

800
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:15,456
I've been there.

801
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:17,117
It's the major
convention, ok?

802
00:35:17,314 --> 00:35:18,695
And if you go back
into the dealers
room,

803
00:35:18,882 --> 00:35:21,021
there's a--there's
a table on the left,

804
00:35:21,217 --> 00:35:22,656
and it's up
against the wall,

805
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:24,384
and that's where
the major players
sit.

806
00:35:24,578 --> 00:35:26,573
That's--that's--
that's where
the celebrity--

807
00:35:26,569 --> 00:35:27,020
that's--that's--
that's where
the celebrity--

808
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:29,769
the-there's a name
that you garner

809
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,428
by sitting
at that table,

810
00:35:31,624 --> 00:35:34,185
and I want
to take my place
among the men

811
00:35:34,376 --> 00:35:36,582
that found
the white mountain
collection,

812
00:35:36,777 --> 00:35:39,021
the mohawk collection,
the winnipeg collection.

813
00:35:39,208 --> 00:35:42,440
I--I--we could
do this tonight.

814
00:35:42,633 --> 00:35:44,234
Why, we could decide.

815
00:35:44,424 --> 00:35:45,987
We could have
the macgillicuddy/link
collection.

816
00:35:46,184 --> 00:35:49,167
I--look, I know--
I know who I am,

817
00:35:49,353 --> 00:35:50,504
and I know
how people look at me.

818
00:35:50,696 --> 00:35:52,451
I'm not stupid.

819
00:35:52,648 --> 00:35:53,799
But if I could just
go to San Diego

820
00:35:53,993 --> 00:35:55,335
and sit down
at the table

821
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:57,321
and have Mike allred
come up

822
00:35:57,512 --> 00:35:59,939
or Matt Wagner just
pat me on the back...

823
00:36:00,136 --> 00:36:02,150
Have--have
gaston dominguez say,

824
00:36:02,344 --> 00:36:05,288
"you--you want
the danger trails,
1 through 5?

825
00:36:05,481 --> 00:36:09,231
Go to
Raymond macgillicuddy.
His are pristine."

826
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:12,706
If I could just have
that quip...

827
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:15,148
It would all
be worth it.

828
00:36:16,776 --> 00:36:20,076
If you allow me that,

829
00:36:20,264 --> 00:36:23,046
my services are yours.

830
00:36:26,735 --> 00:36:28,270
That's--

831
00:36:30,448 --> 00:36:33,584
that's the most pathetic
thing I've ever heard.

832
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:36,335
No money?

833
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:37,965
Jeez. I mean,
you haven't got
the money,

834
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:39,281
get out of dodge.

835
00:36:39,471 --> 00:36:41,034
Honey--
my god, and here I am

836
00:36:41,231 --> 00:36:42,708
up all night worrying
that he's gonna up the ante

837
00:36:42,895 --> 00:36:44,170
and blow us away.

838
00:36:44,367 --> 00:36:45,614
What I was hoping
to offer was--

839
00:36:45,808 --> 00:36:47,639
you sleazy creep...
Honey...

840
00:36:47,823 --> 00:36:49,032
Get away from my house.

841
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:50,352
Honey, there--there's no--

842
00:36:50,543 --> 00:36:52,049
no, no, no, no.
Honey?

843
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:52,881
No.
Excuse me, I--

844
00:36:52,882 --> 00:36:53,295
no.
Excuse me, I--

845
00:36:53,488 --> 00:36:55,214
honey?
No. No, no, no.

846
00:36:55,408 --> 00:36:58,678
This fly is gonna
be in our ointment,
he gets involved.

847
00:36:58,863 --> 00:37:00,110
Get him outta here.

848
00:37:00,303 --> 00:37:01,675
I came in a spirit
of kindness.

849
00:37:01,871 --> 00:37:03,501
I came in a spirit
of fairness.

850
00:37:03,695 --> 00:37:05,526
I told you how hard
it was for me
to walk up here.

851
00:37:05,711 --> 00:37:07,053
You've been
a gentleman.

852
00:37:07,247 --> 00:37:08,331
Your wife has been
an animal.

853
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:09,361
Excuse me?
An animal?

854
00:37:09,551 --> 00:37:10,740
Yes, an animal!

855
00:37:10,927 --> 00:37:11,915
I think it's best
if you--

856
00:37:12,111 --> 00:37:13,550
I offered an olive branch!

857
00:37:13,743 --> 00:37:15,153
I think it's best
that you leave, Raymond.

858
00:37:15,342 --> 00:37:17,011
You know what?
It's--I withdraw my offer,

859
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:18,187
because you don't
know comics!

860
00:37:18,383 --> 00:37:19,697
You're a dabbler.

861
00:37:19,887 --> 00:37:21,105
Why don't you go
back to your store

862
00:37:21,295 --> 00:37:21,650
and sell your
action figures

863
00:37:21,654 --> 00:37:22,392
and sell your
action figures

864
00:37:22,581 --> 00:37:23,828
and your magic cards?!

865
00:37:24,021 --> 00:37:25,843
Now. Now...
What's your--what's your--

866
00:37:26,037 --> 00:37:27,898
what's your favorite
Mac rad boy
run, huh?

867
00:37:28,086 --> 00:37:29,841
What's your favorite

868
00:37:30,038 --> 00:37:32,186
you can't tell me.
You can't tell me,
'cause you don't know!

869
00:37:32,373 --> 00:37:33,687
You know who knew?
Elvis knew.

870
00:37:33,878 --> 00:37:35,412
Elvis knew!
Ok.

871
00:37:35,606 --> 00:37:37,783
You dabbler. You dabbler!
You magic card seller!

872
00:37:37,974 --> 00:37:39,249
You action figure seller!

873
00:37:39,446 --> 00:37:40,884
There is no need
for a commotion.

874
00:37:41,077 --> 00:37:42,458
Oh--oh, I'll make
a commotion, all right.

875
00:37:42,645 --> 00:37:44,016
It's too late...
Oh, it's not too late.

876
00:37:44,214 --> 00:37:45,624
It's not too late.
It's just starting!

877
00:37:45,813 --> 00:37:47,386
For a commotion.

878
00:37:47,574 --> 00:37:48,533
Is this what you
sell at your store?

879
00:37:48,725 --> 00:37:50,097
No, you stop!

880
00:37:50,293 --> 00:37:50,428
don't do it.
No! No!

881
00:37:50,425 --> 00:37:52,506
don't do it.
No! No!

882
00:37:52,693 --> 00:37:55,637
That's my--
no! Hey!

883
00:38:04,854 --> 00:38:06,541
Then for a time,
the great adventure

884
00:38:06,741 --> 00:38:08,918
became the great game,
or so it seemed to me.

885
00:38:10,709 --> 00:38:12,119
Norman and Judy
on one side,

886
00:38:12,309 --> 00:38:13,105
trying to win
Mrs. cresswell's favor...

887
00:38:13,302 --> 00:38:14,040
Aah!

888
00:38:16,789 --> 00:38:19,196
Raymond on the other.

889
00:38:19,196 --> 00:38:19,896
Raymond on the other.

890
00:38:21,724 --> 00:38:23,220
Back and forth...

891
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:27,931
Back and forth.

892
00:38:31,931 --> 00:38:33,082
Unh!

893
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:50,202
Hi, Mrs. cresswell.
Here are the groceries
you wanted.

894
00:38:50,396 --> 00:38:52,832
Well, you're not Raymond.
Where's Raymond?

895
00:38:53,019 --> 00:38:54,458
No, I'm Archie.

896
00:38:54,652 --> 00:38:56,225
Um, Raymond had his
weekly comic delivery.

897
00:38:56,412 --> 00:38:57,850
He had to be back
at his store.

898
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:00,758
You want the funny books,
too, I suppose?

899
00:39:04,124 --> 00:39:05,524
I won't lie. If you're
gonna get rid of 'em,

900
00:39:05,724 --> 00:39:07,258
I want Raymond to get them.

901
00:39:07,451 --> 00:39:08,957
Well, that's fair.

902
00:39:09,148 --> 00:39:10,068
What's in it
for you?

903
00:39:10,268 --> 00:39:11,649
I'm Raymond's friend.

904
00:39:11,836 --> 00:39:14,070
That's it?

905
00:39:14,267 --> 00:39:15,840
Isn't that enough?

906
00:39:18,946 --> 00:39:20,672
You like funny books,
don't you?

907
00:39:20,866 --> 00:39:22,564
Yeah. I guess.

908
00:39:22,753 --> 00:39:26,216
I buy them,
and I read them.

909
00:39:26,402 --> 00:39:28,291
Not really as much
anymore.

910
00:39:28,482 --> 00:39:29,441
Buy or read.

911
00:39:29,634 --> 00:39:30,430
Why's that?

912
00:39:30,625 --> 00:39:33,857
I don't know.

913
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:36,802
Um, just lately I've
been sorta thinking

914
00:39:36,994 --> 00:39:39,775
that comics aren't
the real world.

915
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:43,624
Like last night,
I had on CNN for a while

916
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:45,508
instead of
the cartoon network.

917
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:45,797
Instead of
the cartoon network.

918
00:39:45,985 --> 00:39:47,232
I know that sounds stupid.

919
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:49,123
Comics aren't
the real world?

920
00:39:49,314 --> 00:39:51,012
Now, that's
dangerous talk.

921
00:39:54,882 --> 00:39:56,072
That's a nice photo.

922
00:39:56,258 --> 00:39:58,559
That's me
and my husband.

923
00:39:58,754 --> 00:40:00,384
We were
on our honeymoon.

924
00:40:00,578 --> 00:40:02,822
Spain, in '48.

925
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:04,641
God, perfect!

926
00:40:04,834 --> 00:40:06,695
Right after
world war ii.

927
00:40:06,882 --> 00:40:09,308
'48. Wow.

928
00:40:09,506 --> 00:40:11,040
Why, you interested?

929
00:40:15,945 --> 00:40:17,863
You're not just
giving me lip service

930
00:40:18,057 --> 00:40:19,591
like Norman, right?

931
00:40:19,785 --> 00:40:21,578
No, I'm interested.

932
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,524
Do you drink tea?

933
00:40:29,545 --> 00:40:30,820
Yeah, actually, I do.

934
00:40:33,256 --> 00:40:35,366
You remind me so much
of my husband.

935
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,603
Really?

936
00:40:37,801 --> 00:40:39,719
No, of course not.
No, I guess not.

937
00:40:39,913 --> 00:40:42,598
But you--you have
this real pale skin.

938
00:40:42,793 --> 00:40:43,052
It's--yeah, so does
half of Sweden.

939
00:40:43,052 --> 00:40:45,641
It's--yeah, so does
half of Sweden.

940
00:40:49,449 --> 00:40:51,338
Um, so Spain,
was it nice?

941
00:40:51,529 --> 00:40:54,022
Mmm. It was
the only time

942
00:40:54,217 --> 00:40:55,848
that I ever
left America.

943
00:40:56,041 --> 00:40:57,135
It was--
it was perfect.

944
00:40:57,321 --> 00:40:58,788
It was perfect.

945
00:40:58,985 --> 00:41:02,600
You talked about Spain?

946
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:05,066
Yeah. And she told me
about how her
and her husband

947
00:41:05,257 --> 00:41:06,609
went on a trip
there once

948
00:41:06,793 --> 00:41:08,232
and spent 2 weeks
traveling around.

949
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:09,729
He even ran
with the bulls
in Pamplona.

950
00:41:09,928 --> 00:41:11,827
Paloma.
What?

951
00:41:11,823 --> 00:41:12,331
Paloma.
What?

952
00:41:12,527 --> 00:41:14,033
That run with the bulls
is in Paloma.

953
00:41:14,223 --> 00:41:16,975
Uh, no, ray,
I'm pretty sure
it's Pamplona.

954
00:41:17,167 --> 00:41:20,082
I mean, who's Paloma?

955
00:41:20,271 --> 00:41:21,326
Isn't that
somebody's daughter?

956
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:22,900
Mm-mmm.

957
00:41:23,087 --> 00:41:24,679
So, when did you
get around to talking

958
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,714
about the comic books?

959
00:41:25,903 --> 00:41:28,051
Well, it just--

960
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:29,543
I didn't feel right
about it,

961
00:41:29,743 --> 00:41:31,402
so it just
didn't come up.

962
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,559
So, what'd you
talk about?

963
00:41:32,751 --> 00:41:34,928
Well, I told you, stuff.

964
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:36,077
You know, her life.

965
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:37,805
Stuff?!
Yeah, stuff.

966
00:41:37,998 --> 00:41:39,542
So you never thought
to ask her

967
00:41:39,726 --> 00:41:40,590
if she was comin' around
to selling me the books?

968
00:41:40,594 --> 00:41:41,266
If she was comin' around
to selling me the books?

969
00:41:41,455 --> 00:41:43,018
Oh, no, I did get around
to asking her that much.

970
00:41:43,215 --> 00:41:44,338
And?

971
00:41:44,526 --> 00:41:45,524
No way.

972
00:41:51,695 --> 00:41:53,805
I've been reading
Hemingway.

973
00:41:53,999 --> 00:41:56,655
"Papa" Hemingway.

974
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,545
It's all because
of you, you know?

975
00:41:58,735 --> 00:42:02,350
Oh, dear, what have
I gone and done now?

976
00:42:02,543 --> 00:42:03,886
It's all that talk
about Spain.

977
00:42:04,078 --> 00:42:05,517
The running
of the bulls.

978
00:42:05,711 --> 00:42:08,147
You're not reading
cliff notes now?
No.

979
00:42:08,335 --> 00:42:09,361
Or comic versions?

980
00:42:09,366 --> 00:42:10,641
Or comic versions?

981
00:42:10,838 --> 00:42:12,880
Wasn't there a comic company
that used to adapt books?

982
00:42:13,077 --> 00:42:15,446
Yeah, it was called
classics illustrated.

983
00:42:15,638 --> 00:42:17,335
But they did
mostly older books,

984
00:42:17,526 --> 00:42:20,144
like, um, h. G. Wells
and
3 musketeers.

985
00:42:20,341 --> 00:42:23,870
I bet they could not
transport you like Hemingway.

986
00:42:24,053 --> 00:42:25,645
Now, hold on.

987
00:42:25,845 --> 00:42:27,677
There are good
and bad writers
in all mediums.

988
00:42:27,861 --> 00:42:30,930
Comics are just
a different type
of storytelling.

989
00:42:31,125 --> 00:42:32,986
You don't really
internalize as much.
Oh.

990
00:42:33,174 --> 00:42:34,766
Did you like that?

991
00:42:34,965 --> 00:42:37,718
Wow. Internalize.

992
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:38,140
I think
it's probably
the first time

993
00:42:38,137 --> 00:42:39,096
I think
it's probably
the first time

994
00:42:39,285 --> 00:42:40,119
I've ever
used that word.

995
00:42:41,781 --> 00:42:43,191
don't you go
getting giddy on me.

996
00:42:49,653 --> 00:42:51,255
You know,
I didn't realize

997
00:42:51,445 --> 00:42:53,009
that you needed help
gardening. I can do that.

998
00:42:53,205 --> 00:42:54,740
Oh, no,
that's all right.

999
00:42:54,933 --> 00:42:57,015
Archie's doing great.

1000
00:42:57,205 --> 00:42:58,069
He used to help
his mother.

1001
00:42:58,261 --> 00:42:59,067
Did you know that?

1002
00:42:59,253 --> 00:43:01,746
No, I didn't.

1003
00:43:01,941 --> 00:43:04,665
Yeah, um, back
before she died.

1004
00:43:04,854 --> 00:43:06,484
Hmm.

1005
00:43:06,678 --> 00:43:06,908
How's Norman?

1006
00:43:06,908 --> 00:43:07,742
How's Norman?

1007
00:43:07,931 --> 00:43:09,533
Recovering.

1008
00:43:09,724 --> 00:43:11,325
That was careless of him

1009
00:43:11,516 --> 00:43:15,026
not to turn off
that fuse box,
wasn't it?

1010
00:43:15,228 --> 00:43:16,954
Right.

1011
00:43:18,716 --> 00:43:21,152
Well, I'll
see you later.

1012
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:23,066
Bye-bye.

1013
00:43:28,572 --> 00:43:30,010
She seems upset.

1014
00:43:30,203 --> 00:43:31,296
Well, not to worry.

1015
00:43:31,484 --> 00:43:33,115
What harm can it do?

1016
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:48,410
Chocolate?

1017
00:43:48,603 --> 00:43:50,138
Isn't that boy toy
you got her sweet enough?

1018
00:44:04,801 --> 00:44:07,870
God, ray,
I'm sorry.

1019
00:44:08,066 --> 00:44:09,763
Broken.

1020
00:44:09,954 --> 00:44:12,093
Broken in 3 places.

1021
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:13,603
The doctor says
I might have

1022
00:44:13,794 --> 00:44:17,218
permanent wrist
mobility problems.

1023
00:44:17,411 --> 00:44:19,626
God, that really sucks.

1024
00:44:19,810 --> 00:44:21,374
She said her foot slipped
on the accelerator.

1025
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:23,105
Like, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, sure--that happened.

1026
00:44:23,298 --> 00:44:24,967
Well, why didn't you
tell the police?

1027
00:44:25,154 --> 00:44:26,276
I mean, they should
at least know about
the comics.

1028
00:44:26,466 --> 00:44:28,096
No, ok?

1029
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:29,537
I'm not talkin'
to the police.

1030
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:30,852
Yeah, but that's
like motive--

1031
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:32,510
nah-uh-uh!

1032
00:44:32,706 --> 00:44:33,224
Ok, this is between
me and Norman and Judy.

1033
00:44:33,222 --> 00:44:36,578
Ok, this is between
me and Norman and Judy.

1034
00:44:36,770 --> 00:44:38,918
Now, I got
my wrist fixed...

1035
00:44:39,106 --> 00:44:41,082
But now I'm gonna
fix them!

1036
00:44:43,394 --> 00:44:44,804
No!

1037
00:44:44,994 --> 00:44:46,653
Yes. Who knows what
Raymond'll try next?

1038
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:48,806
Why was it
that he didn't
have me arrested?

1039
00:44:48,994 --> 00:44:50,394
I just want
to feel safe.

1040
00:44:50,594 --> 00:44:52,071
Just tell me that,
smarty-pants.
No!

1041
00:44:52,259 --> 00:44:54,052
Do you understand me?
I forbid you, ok? No.

1042
00:44:54,242 --> 00:44:57,445
Forbid me?
Yeah, right.

1043
00:45:05,737 --> 00:45:06,638
What can I do for you?

1044
00:45:06,824 --> 00:45:08,359
Deal me in.

1045
00:45:08,553 --> 00:45:09,675
I'm the one waving
the plastic today.

1046
00:45:09,865 --> 00:45:11,466
You need a gun?

1047
00:45:11,656 --> 00:45:13,507
No, garden fertilizer.

1048
00:45:13,705 --> 00:45:15,277
I understand.

1049
00:45:15,464 --> 00:45:16,682
The streets
aren't as safe
as they used to be.

1050
00:45:16,873 --> 00:45:18,120
Yeah,
not with her drivin'.

1051
00:45:18,313 --> 00:45:20,260
Might I recommend
a derringer?

1052
00:45:20,456 --> 00:45:22,672
Petite,
for a woman's hand
or clutch purse.

1053
00:45:22,857 --> 00:45:24,257
I thought it was illegal
for a guy like you

1054
00:45:24,456 --> 00:45:25,674
to use words like petite
or clutch purse.

1055
00:45:25,864 --> 00:45:27,945
Let's talk high-caliber.

1056
00:45:28,136 --> 00:45:29,258
The . 45.

1057
00:45:29,449 --> 00:45:30,629
Damn it, no. Listen.

1058
00:45:30,824 --> 00:45:31,975
If you're gonna
get a gun,

1059
00:45:32,168 --> 00:45:33,482
at least get
a small gun.

1060
00:45:33,673 --> 00:45:35,341
I mean, let's
be realistic, right?

1061
00:45:35,529 --> 00:45:36,488
Why don't you
just take a look
at this 9 millimeter?

1062
00:45:39,913 --> 00:45:41,448
And bullets, of course?

1063
00:45:55,305 --> 00:45:57,156
So, I forget
which anthology
it was in,

1064
00:45:57,352 --> 00:45:59,309
but Larry never
talks about

1065
00:45:59,497 --> 00:45:59,535
how superman can never
even marry Lois.

1066
00:45:59,535 --> 00:46:01,070
How superman can never
even marry Lois.

1067
00:46:01,263 --> 00:46:02,510
At least,
if he did, he could
never screw her.

1068
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:07,079
'Cause he'd have
supersperm,

1069
00:46:07,278 --> 00:46:08,851
which would never die
and be superstrong

1070
00:46:09,039 --> 00:46:10,957
and would mess up
her insides.

1071
00:46:11,151 --> 00:46:12,494
Well,
I gotta think about this.

1072
00:46:12,687 --> 00:46:13,973
Why stop there?

1073
00:46:14,159 --> 00:46:16,623
I mean, if supes had
supersperm,

1074
00:46:16,815 --> 00:46:18,925
then he would come
in a superspurt.

1075
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:20,461
Who's to say
it wouldn't shoot

1076
00:46:20,655 --> 00:46:22,765
right out the top
of Lois' head?

1077
00:46:22,959 --> 00:46:24,503
Yeah, I think
he commented on that.

1078
00:46:24,687 --> 00:46:26,442
In the book.

1079
00:46:26,639 --> 00:46:28,307
The writer talks about
how superman couldn't
even jerk off,

1080
00:46:28,306 --> 00:46:29,294
the writer talks about
how superman couldn't
even jerk off,

1081
00:46:29,487 --> 00:46:31,597
because the sperm
would have the ability
to fly.

1082
00:46:31,792 --> 00:46:33,911
'Cause they're
tiny versions of him,

1083
00:46:34,095 --> 00:46:36,071
and how they'd forever
fly around the world

1084
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:37,872
looking for eggs
to impregnate.

1085
00:46:48,783 --> 00:46:50,193
And that was
what it took.

1086
00:46:50,383 --> 00:46:52,972
Heavy rain
and buckets aplenty

1087
00:46:53,167 --> 00:46:56,466
to make Raymond see...

1088
00:47:02,613 --> 00:47:04,723
It was time
for desperate measures...

1089
00:47:09,813 --> 00:47:11,798
Seniors...

1090
00:47:20,437 --> 00:47:24,532
And desperate men.

1091
00:47:30,517 --> 00:47:32,407
What are we doin' here?

1092
00:47:32,598 --> 00:47:34,775
Uh, I'm just gonna
go see a friend of mine.

1093
00:47:34,965 --> 00:47:37,142
Since when did you
have friends west
of third street?

1094
00:47:37,333 --> 00:47:39,088
Never mind, ok? Just--

1095
00:47:39,285 --> 00:47:41,241
no. Since when
did you have friends
west of third street,

1096
00:47:41,429 --> 00:47:42,897
who hang out
in topless bars?

1097
00:47:43,093 --> 00:47:43,995
He's an old friend of mine
from high school.

1098
00:47:44,181 --> 00:47:45,907
He's a good friend.

1099
00:47:46,101 --> 00:47:47,444
So, why are you
seeing him now?

1100
00:47:47,637 --> 00:47:49,239
What's with
all the questions, ok?!

1101
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:50,389
I thought you were
my friend.

1102
00:47:50,581 --> 00:47:51,953
I asked you to help me.

1103
00:47:52,149 --> 00:47:53,213
I need some help
right now, ok?
Ok.

1104
00:47:53,397 --> 00:47:54,615
Will you help me?
Ok.

1105
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:54,745
Will you help me?
Ok.

1106
00:47:54,939 --> 00:47:55,774
I need help.
Help. Help me!
Fine. Ok.

1107
00:47:58,588 --> 00:47:59,834
What do you want me
to do?

1108
00:48:00,028 --> 00:48:02,589
Here. I want you
to hold this.

1109
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:03,960
What?!

1110
00:48:04,156 --> 00:48:05,470
Are you
shittin' me, man?!

1111
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:06,658
Look, it's dangerous
in there, ok?

1112
00:48:06,844 --> 00:48:08,148
And if I come out runnin',

1113
00:48:08,348 --> 00:48:09,508
just, uh, fire a shot
in the air--

1114
00:48:09,692 --> 00:48:10,517
fire a shot
in the air?!

1115
00:48:10,716 --> 00:48:12,029
Yeah. Scare 'em.

1116
00:48:12,219 --> 00:48:13,466
But what if they
don't get scared?

1117
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:15,041
What if they
shoot back at me?

1118
00:48:15,227 --> 00:48:16,407
Just--just--
I'll be back in a minute.

1119
00:48:16,431 --> 00:48:38,431
...:::Lord Sadler:::...
lordsadler2012@gmail.com

1120
00:49:08,514 --> 00:49:09,953
Hey, Carter.

1121
00:49:10,146 --> 00:49:13,570
It's--it's--it's me,
Raymond macgillicuddy.

1122
00:49:13,763 --> 00:49:15,460
No bells.

1123
00:49:15,649 --> 00:49:17,635
Come on,
central high spartans,

1124
00:49:17,826 --> 00:49:20,128
class of '84. Whoo!

1125
00:49:20,322 --> 00:49:20,936
Still no bells.

1126
00:49:20,934 --> 00:49:22,180
Still no bells.

1127
00:49:29,219 --> 00:49:31,204
Ain't she sweet?

1128
00:49:33,282 --> 00:49:34,913
Oh, yeah.

1129
00:49:35,106 --> 00:49:36,353
That's one sweet piece

1130
00:49:36,546 --> 00:49:38,435
of pussy pie
right there, huh?

1131
00:49:38,626 --> 00:49:41,983
That's my girlfriend.

1132
00:49:42,178 --> 00:49:45,602
Uh, um...

1133
00:49:45,794 --> 00:49:48,163
So, what do you want?

1134
00:49:48,354 --> 00:49:49,314
I haven't seen you
here before.

1135
00:49:49,506 --> 00:49:49,708
Which is surprising,

1136
00:49:49,705 --> 00:49:50,923
which is surprising,

1137
00:49:51,112 --> 00:49:52,934
'cause I see your kind
here all the time.

1138
00:49:53,129 --> 00:49:54,538
Well, I don't have
that many dollar bills

1139
00:49:54,728 --> 00:49:57,193
to throw around,
unfortunately.

1140
00:49:57,385 --> 00:49:59,015
Which is why I came
to see you.

1141
00:49:59,209 --> 00:50:01,645
Uh, see, some
of the guys and I
from high school,

1142
00:50:01,833 --> 00:50:03,233
you know, we get
to talking and stuff,

1143
00:50:03,432 --> 00:50:05,293
and your name pops up,
and, uh, you know,

1144
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:06,986
no one really knows much
about what's goin' on,

1145
00:50:07,177 --> 00:50:08,356
but there are,
you know--

1146
00:50:08,553 --> 00:50:09,867
there are rumors
about you.

1147
00:50:10,057 --> 00:50:11,754
Oh, yeah?

1148
00:50:11,944 --> 00:50:13,287
Who says what?

1149
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:15,878
Well, it's--
ok, it's not important.

1150
00:50:16,072 --> 00:50:18,479
What is--whew. Whoo!
Time out.

1151
00:50:18,476 --> 00:50:19,109
What is--whew. Whoo!
Time out.

1152
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,162
Oh, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

1153
00:50:29,352 --> 00:50:31,175
I'm remembering now.

1154
00:50:31,368 --> 00:50:33,776
I used to beat
the crap outta you.

1155
00:50:33,961 --> 00:50:35,812
Mackill-a-kiddie.
Yeah, yeah.

1156
00:50:36,008 --> 00:50:38,252
Yeah, macgillicuddy.
Cuddy.

1157
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:39,975
Yeah, you used to cry
when I hit you.

1158
00:50:40,169 --> 00:50:42,278
Kicked you
in the balls once,
and you fainted.

1159
00:50:42,472 --> 00:50:44,812
No, I--I threw up
in front of
science class,

1160
00:50:45,001 --> 00:50:47,245
but, um, hey,
bygones be bygones, ok?

1161
00:50:47,247 --> 00:50:48,398
But, um, hey,
bygones be bygones, ok?

1162
00:50:48,591 --> 00:50:50,125
'Cause, see, I, uh,

1163
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:51,988
think I've got
some work for you.
I want--I--

1164
00:50:52,175 --> 00:50:55,599
I need you to steal
something for me.

1165
00:50:55,791 --> 00:50:57,038
What's in it for me?

1166
00:50:57,231 --> 00:51:00,079
Well, I can't pay you.

1167
00:51:00,271 --> 00:51:01,652
Good-bye.

1168
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:03,182
Listen, please.
Just give me a moment.

1169
00:51:03,375 --> 00:51:06,032
Uh, look--but I'll
give you a half--

1170
00:51:06,223 --> 00:51:07,853
a half of the profits
after resale,

1171
00:51:08,047 --> 00:51:12,430
and I'm talkin',
like, a lot of cash.

1172
00:51:12,622 --> 00:51:14,061
So what's to steal?

1173
00:51:14,255 --> 00:51:15,885
Comic books.

1174
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:17,968
Good-bye.
No! No, listen!

1175
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:19,540
Just hear me out.
Now, don't--
don't think--

1176
00:51:19,727 --> 00:51:21,194
forget I said comics.

1177
00:51:21,391 --> 00:51:22,321
don't even think comics.
Just think something

1178
00:51:22,511 --> 00:51:24,074
worth a lot of money.

1179
00:51:24,271 --> 00:51:26,477
Ok, just think--just
think the mother lode,
ok?

1180
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:27,946
The holy grail
of comics.

1181
00:51:28,144 --> 00:51:30,992
Just--it's just--
it is worth--

1182
00:51:31,183 --> 00:51:32,621
god knows
what it's worth.

1183
00:51:32,815 --> 00:51:35,376
Million dollars,
maybe more.

1184
00:51:35,567 --> 00:51:37,302
I used to like comics.

1185
00:51:39,311 --> 00:51:41,545
So, are you interested?

1186
00:51:41,743 --> 00:51:43,411
Do we have a deal,
or can we partner
on this thing?

1187
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:44,338
What's goin' on?

1188
00:52:06,997 --> 00:52:08,244
What did you--

1189
00:52:08,438 --> 00:52:10,327
I told you to wait
in the car!

1190
00:52:22,869 --> 00:52:24,816
Well, I called
the bank about that,

1191
00:52:25,014 --> 00:52:26,682
and they haven't
called back yet.

1192
00:52:26,869 --> 00:52:28,979
They haven't called back.
You know, you can call again.

1193
00:52:34,453 --> 00:52:36,400
Hello, norm. Judy.

1194
00:52:36,597 --> 00:52:37,815
Hey.

1195
00:52:38,005 --> 00:52:39,223
How's it goin'?

1196
00:52:39,414 --> 00:52:41,811
Oh, I'm fine. Fine.

1197
00:52:42,006 --> 00:52:42,332
Um, do you have
the most recent
Neil gaiman hardcover?

1198
00:52:42,332 --> 00:52:46,523
Um, do you have
the most recent
Neil gaiman hardcover?

1199
00:52:46,716 --> 00:52:48,385
Uh, the British edition,
not the American.

1200
00:52:48,572 --> 00:52:50,874
Oh, well,
we had that one,
but we're out now.

1201
00:52:51,068 --> 00:52:53,657
You're, uh,
slow on the uptake.
That's not like you.

1202
00:52:53,852 --> 00:52:55,291
Well, I didn't think
I wanted it,

1203
00:52:55,484 --> 00:52:57,508
but I changed my mind.

1204
00:52:57,692 --> 00:52:59,380
Well, change
is good.

1205
00:52:59,579 --> 00:53:00,893
Say, you take
your collectin'

1206
00:53:01,084 --> 00:53:02,590
pretty
seriously,
don't ya?

1207
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:03,931
You spend a lot
every month.

1208
00:53:04,124 --> 00:53:05,505
Every week,
practically.

1209
00:53:05,691 --> 00:53:07,197
Yeah, between here
and Raymond's store,

1210
00:53:07,388 --> 00:53:09,268
you must spend
every single
spare cent, huh?

1211
00:53:09,467 --> 00:53:11,107
It's ok.
We know about
Raymond's store.

1212
00:53:11,103 --> 00:53:11,420
It's ok.
We know about
Raymond's store.

1213
00:53:11,612 --> 00:53:12,802
We don't
really consider

1214
00:53:12,988 --> 00:53:14,359
his store
competition.

1215
00:53:14,556 --> 00:53:16,157
We feel like
we offer
so much more.

1216
00:53:16,347 --> 00:53:18,265
In fact, we like
that you go there.

1217
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:20,225
Say, conan, how
would you like
free comics?

1218
00:53:20,412 --> 00:53:22,934
Every week.
Gratis.

1219
00:53:23,132 --> 00:53:24,475
What would I have to do?

1220
00:53:31,547 --> 00:53:33,465
She said she wasn't
going to sell.

1221
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:35,166
What was I supposed to do?

1222
00:53:35,355 --> 00:53:37,590
Do nothing, man.
You shrug
your shoulders,

1223
00:53:37,788 --> 00:53:39,427
you walk away,
and get on with the
rest of your life.

1224
00:53:39,612 --> 00:53:39,871
Archie, this
is my life, all right?
This is my life.

1225
00:53:39,874 --> 00:53:42,214
Archie, this
is my life, all right?
This is my life.

1226
00:53:42,402 --> 00:53:44,129
And then I saw
those beautiful books,

1227
00:53:44,322 --> 00:53:48,101
and I saw a way
I could finally
improve things. Finally.

1228
00:53:49,794 --> 00:53:50,561
When?

1229
00:53:50,754 --> 00:53:52,490
Tonight.

1230
00:53:52,674 --> 00:53:54,659
don't worry, ok?
I told him to be careful

1231
00:53:54,851 --> 00:53:56,155
and not hurt
your little girlfriend.

1232
00:53:57,505 --> 00:54:00,747
Oh. Hi, conan.

1233
00:54:00,930 --> 00:54:02,273
Hi, guys.

1234
00:54:12,802 --> 00:54:15,113
This is crazy.
Those lunatics are
gonna steal the books?

1235
00:54:15,298 --> 00:54:17,092
That's right.
This whole thing

1236
00:54:17,282 --> 00:54:18,653
has turned into
a sea of madness,

1237
00:54:18,851 --> 00:54:20,261
and we're clinging
to a buoy.

1238
00:54:20,449 --> 00:54:22,109
A boy? You on about
having a kid again?

1239
00:54:22,306 --> 00:54:24,579
Not a boy. A buoy.

1240
00:54:26,690 --> 00:54:28,637
A life buoy.

1241
00:54:28,834 --> 00:54:30,695
Oh! Oh.

1242
00:54:30,882 --> 00:54:31,678
Now I've lost
my train of thought.

1243
00:54:31,874 --> 00:54:33,255
Sorry. Sorry.

1244
00:54:33,443 --> 00:54:34,267
Clinging to a buoy
in a sea of madness.

1245
00:54:34,466 --> 00:54:35,713
Mm-hmm.

1246
00:54:35,905 --> 00:54:37,421
We can make this
simple again.

1247
00:54:37,417 --> 00:54:37,446
We can make this
simple again.

1248
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:38,858
Why, I--I don't think
going in there with a gun

1249
00:54:39,049 --> 00:54:39,912
is simple.
I don't think so.

1250
00:54:40,105 --> 00:54:41,841
We stop the crime.

1251
00:54:42,025 --> 00:54:43,655
The old woman
sees us do it,
and she's grateful.

1252
00:54:43,849 --> 00:54:45,153
How can she
not be grateful?

1253
00:54:45,352 --> 00:54:46,896
Then we offer her
the money again.

1254
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:49,449
Why don't we just tell
the cops what we know?

1255
00:54:49,641 --> 00:54:52,134
Then she'll be
grateful to them.
Jeez, norm. God.

1256
00:54:52,329 --> 00:54:54,151
It's whoever she sees
doing her right.

1257
00:54:54,345 --> 00:54:55,918
Oh.

1258
00:54:56,104 --> 00:54:57,092
This is
too dangerous,
I think.

1259
00:54:59,209 --> 00:55:01,386
If you do this for me,
I'll let you smoke a cigarette.

1260
00:55:15,369 --> 00:55:18,313
So began
the long night of
twists and turns.

1261
00:55:21,448 --> 00:55:23,817
Though looking back,
I still wonder about Carter,

1262
00:55:24,009 --> 00:55:27,529
with his violent temper
and his damp walls,

1263
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:29,897
why he decided
to do what he did...

1264
00:55:33,992 --> 00:55:34,961
And how things
might have been
if he hadn't.

1265
00:55:34,959 --> 00:55:36,657
And how things
might have been
if he hadn't.

1266
00:55:54,222 --> 00:55:56,399
Is there anything
I should know about?

1267
00:55:56,591 --> 00:55:58,279
What?

1268
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,947
You know, is there
anything I should know about

1269
00:56:00,143 --> 00:56:01,965
about you
and the old lady?

1270
00:56:02,159 --> 00:56:03,731
Is there anything,
like, Harold and maude
goin' on or somethin'?

1271
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:04,430
Is there anything,
like, Harold and maude
goin' on or somethin'?

1272
00:56:04,623 --> 00:56:06,637
Gross! No.
We're just friends.

1273
00:56:06,831 --> 00:56:08,471
Look, I--hey!
I'm not saying, you know,

1274
00:56:08,655 --> 00:56:09,835
it would be
wrong if there was.

1275
00:56:10,031 --> 00:56:11,786
It's just, uh...

1276
00:56:11,983 --> 00:56:13,671
You know, far be it
for me to judge.

1277
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:15,665
The heart wants
what the heart wants.

1278
00:56:15,856 --> 00:56:17,332
You're
creeping me out.

1279
00:56:17,519 --> 00:56:18,832
Oh, I'm creeping
you
out?

1280
00:56:19,023 --> 00:56:20,615
I'm not the one
doin' an old lady.

1281
00:56:20,815 --> 00:56:22,388
I'm not doin'
the old lady, ok?
She's my friend.

1282
00:56:22,576 --> 00:56:24,848
We hang out.
We talk about Spain.

1283
00:56:26,639 --> 00:56:29,967
Whatever you say, Romeo.
It's just...

1284
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,337
You don't seem happy
about this whole thing.

1285
00:56:32,527 --> 00:56:34,071
I'm ecstatic
about it.

1286
00:56:37,878 --> 00:56:40,592
Just remember,
it's for the best.

1287
00:56:40,790 --> 00:56:43,158
The best.
The best
for who, ray?

1288
00:56:43,349 --> 00:56:45,430
Jesus. Do you
give a shit

1289
00:56:45,621 --> 00:56:46,964
what I think
about anything?

1290
00:56:47,157 --> 00:56:49,017
No, you don't!

1291
00:56:49,205 --> 00:56:51,919
I'm like
an accessory
to you.

1292
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:53,469
Jesus!

1293
00:56:57,206 --> 00:56:58,452
Carter is
half an hour late.

1294
00:56:58,645 --> 00:56:59,796
We got here
15 minutes early.

1295
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:01,275
I am sick
of this shit.

1296
00:57:01,273 --> 00:57:01,426
I am sick
of this shit.

1297
00:57:01,621 --> 00:57:03,510
Look, ok. If you're
so sick of this shit,

1298
00:57:03,702 --> 00:57:04,632
why don't you just go home,
back to your 4 walls
and a microwave?!

1299
00:57:04,821 --> 00:57:06,615
Is that what you want?

1300
00:57:09,397 --> 00:57:12,379
Archie... come on.

1301
00:57:15,061 --> 00:57:16,912
Ray.

1302
00:57:17,109 --> 00:57:19,286
Did you say that
Carter drove
a blue truck?

1303
00:57:19,477 --> 00:57:21,626
You did,
right? Blue?
Yeah.

1304
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:23,088
I think I see it
parked behind

1305
00:57:23,286 --> 00:57:23,957
Mrs. cresswell's
house.

1306
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:24,859
What?

1307
00:57:32,027 --> 00:57:34,559
I completely understand.

1308
00:57:34,748 --> 00:57:36,187
I'd be mad, too,
if I was being robbed.

1309
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:40,341
But, uh... you know,

1310
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:42,976
it's kinda like
a roller coaster ride.

1311
00:57:43,164 --> 00:57:44,765
There's nothin'
you can do,

1312
00:57:44,956 --> 00:57:47,613
except hang on and hope.

1313
00:57:49,852 --> 00:57:51,396
It's a nice house
you got here,
by the way.

1314
00:57:51,579 --> 00:57:53,881
Are you going to kill me?

1315
00:57:54,076 --> 00:57:55,898
I haven't decided yet.

1316
00:57:59,067 --> 00:58:01,053
But I like this town.

1317
00:58:01,244 --> 00:58:03,652
And, uh...

1318
00:58:03,836 --> 00:58:06,329
You identifying me,
you can imagine.

1319
00:58:08,028 --> 00:58:10,550
I'm an old woman.
I forget things.

1320
00:58:10,748 --> 00:58:13,308
Oh, yeah. That's right.

1321
00:58:13,499 --> 00:58:17,211
You're the, uh...

1322
00:58:17,403 --> 00:58:20,098
You're the drooling,
old, senile type,
aren't you?

1323
00:58:21,884 --> 00:58:23,361
Who you trying to fool?

1324
00:58:25,148 --> 00:58:27,584
Your voice is clear,
your eyes are sharp,

1325
00:58:27,586 --> 00:58:29,284
your voice is clear,
your eyes are sharp,

1326
00:58:29,474 --> 00:58:31,459
and this house
doesn't have that, uh,

1327
00:58:31,650 --> 00:58:34,527
that stale piss smell
most old folks'
places do.

1328
00:58:36,642 --> 00:58:40,641
Yeah, you're one
smart little cookie,
aren't you?

1329
00:58:40,835 --> 00:58:42,503
I tell you
what I'm gonna do.

1330
00:58:42,690 --> 00:58:44,704
These are the last
of the boxes.

1331
00:58:44,898 --> 00:58:48,264
I'm gonna load 'em up
into my truck,
and, uh...

1332
00:58:48,450 --> 00:58:50,560
And then I'll
make up my mind.
All right?

1333
00:58:51,810 --> 00:58:52,673
Aah! Aah!

1334
00:58:52,866 --> 00:58:54,592
Freeze!

1335
00:58:54,786 --> 00:58:56,359
Mrs. cresswell,
are you ok?

1336
00:58:56,358 --> 00:58:56,741
Mrs. cresswell,
are you ok?

1337
00:58:56,930 --> 00:58:58,244
You're late.

1338
00:58:58,434 --> 00:58:59,585
Oh, yeah? Well,
look who's early.

1339
00:59:02,082 --> 00:59:04,221
I figured
you'd see my truck
and follow me in.

1340
00:59:04,417 --> 00:59:07,170
Oh.

1341
00:59:07,362 --> 00:59:09,289
Thank you, god.
I'm so relieved.
I just--

1342
00:59:09,474 --> 00:59:10,529
Raymond, did you hear
what he just said?

1343
00:59:10,722 --> 00:59:12,161
He might kill Mrs. cresswell.

1344
00:59:12,354 --> 00:59:13,534
Yeah, I thought you--
I thought you might

1345
00:59:13,730 --> 00:59:14,468
wanna pull
a double cross.

1346
00:59:14,658 --> 00:59:16,039
Oh, I am.

1347
00:59:16,226 --> 00:59:17,636
So you're gonna kill
all 3 of us then?

1348
00:59:17,826 --> 00:59:19,360
No, you two
can walk.

1349
00:59:19,554 --> 00:59:21,376
You'd be implicated
if you talked,
and, uh...

1350
00:59:23,394 --> 00:59:24,545
Believe me,
you and jail time

1351
00:59:24,738 --> 00:59:25,132
would be
an uneasy union.

1352
00:59:25,129 --> 00:59:26,059
Would be
an uneasy union.

1353
00:59:26,248 --> 00:59:28,425
Now you can
turn around

1354
00:59:28,617 --> 00:59:29,768
and go back out
the way you came.

1355
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:31,428
Not without Mrs. cresswell.

1356
00:59:31,624 --> 00:59:33,255
I'm not goin' anywhere
without those comics.

1357
00:59:33,448 --> 00:59:36,000
Because I--I--I would
rather be dead

1358
00:59:36,201 --> 00:59:37,544
than leave
without those comics.

1359
00:59:37,736 --> 00:59:38,791
Suit yourself.

1360
00:59:38,984 --> 00:59:41,286
I've got the gun.

1361
00:59:42,889 --> 00:59:44,395
So do I.

1362
00:59:45,961 --> 00:59:47,208
Hold it!
Drop your gun!

1363
00:59:47,401 --> 00:59:49,616
Uh, uh, you,
drop the gun!

1364
00:59:54,985 --> 00:59:56,903
Drop the gun,
you motherfucking asshole!

1365
00:59:58,152 --> 00:59:58,929
Rawr!

1366
00:59:59,112 --> 01:00:01,376
Finally...

1367
01:00:01,576 --> 01:00:02,698
Someone here
who speaks my lingo.

1368
01:00:04,329 --> 01:00:05,393
Get away from
the comic books!

1369
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:08,867
Now you! Drop your gun!

1370
01:00:09,064 --> 01:00:10,407
Drop your fucking gun!

1371
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:12,969
No! No! No!
Those are mine!

1372
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:15,184
Those are mine,
goddamn it!
They're not yours!

1373
01:00:15,368 --> 01:00:17,449
And him, him I might
have listened to.

1374
01:00:17,641 --> 01:00:19,780
But not you, you bitch!

1375
01:00:21,736 --> 01:00:22,666
Oh, what are you smiling at?

1376
01:00:22,671 --> 01:00:23,247
Oh, what are you smiling at?

1377
01:00:23,439 --> 01:00:25,012
Nothing. It's just
that I thought

1378
01:00:25,199 --> 01:00:26,638
I was dealing
with fools.

1379
01:00:26,831 --> 01:00:28,298
Well, now you see
differently, my friend.

1380
01:00:29,519 --> 01:00:30,574
No, I don't.

1381
01:00:35,406 --> 01:00:36,461
P-p-put the gun down.

1382
01:00:38,286 --> 01:00:39,859
Come on, ray.
What are you doin'?

1383
01:00:40,047 --> 01:00:40,977
We're not gunmen.
We're comic book
collectors.

1384
01:00:43,343 --> 01:00:46,767
Archie's right.
This is
my
home.

1385
01:00:46,959 --> 01:00:48,234
And I want you
out of here.

1386
01:00:49,614 --> 01:00:51,159
Mrs. cresswell.

1387
01:00:51,343 --> 01:00:51,439
Put the--
put the gun--oh!

1388
01:00:51,442 --> 01:00:52,114
Put the--
put the gun--oh!

1389
01:00:52,303 --> 01:00:53,041
Baby!

1390
01:00:56,207 --> 01:00:57,041
Baby, are you ok?

1391
01:00:57,231 --> 01:00:58,123
You shot me!

1392
01:00:58,319 --> 01:00:59,249
Are you ok?

1393
01:00:59,439 --> 01:01:00,906
Here, Mrs. cresswell.

1394
01:01:03,215 --> 01:01:05,545
Oh, god. Are you ok?

1395
01:01:05,743 --> 01:01:07,699
Raymond, call
an ambulance.

1396
01:01:07,887 --> 01:01:10,448
I have to go after Carter.
He's got most of the books.
You coming?

1397
01:01:10,639 --> 01:01:13,449
She is bleeding
to death! Call 911!

1398
01:01:13,647 --> 01:01:16,016
She's dying, Archie, all right?
There's nothin' you can--
she--she's done.

1399
01:01:17,806 --> 01:01:19,216
You motherfucker.

1400
01:01:19,407 --> 01:01:20,213
I'm goin'. Now,
are you comin' with me?

1401
01:01:20,214 --> 01:01:21,240
I'm goin'. Now,
are you comin' with me?

1402
01:01:21,429 --> 01:01:22,934
Are you with me?!

1403
01:01:23,125 --> 01:01:25,427
Aw, shoot.

1404
01:01:25,622 --> 01:01:26,456
Baby, can you walk?

1405
01:01:26,646 --> 01:01:27,375
Yeah.

1406
01:01:36,853 --> 01:01:38,426
Aah!

1407
01:01:38,613 --> 01:01:40,914
You're such a big boy.
Let's go, baby.

1408
01:01:41,109 --> 01:01:42,385
Call 911.
I can't leave her.

1409
01:01:42,581 --> 01:01:43,742
I'm trying to stop
the bleeding.

1410
01:01:43,926 --> 01:01:45,297
You can walk,
you think?

1411
01:01:45,493 --> 01:01:47,248
I am begging you!
It is not too late!

1412
01:01:47,445 --> 01:01:48,317
It is for her.
That bitch should have sold
while she could.

1413
01:01:55,189 --> 01:01:56,023
You ok?

1414
01:01:58,037 --> 01:01:59,409
Do you know
how to get to
the hospital from here?

1415
01:01:59,605 --> 01:02:00,507
Yeah, honey, but we're
not goin' there,

1416
01:02:00,693 --> 01:02:01,489
not yet. You're ok.

1417
01:02:01,685 --> 01:02:03,229
No, I'm hurt!

1418
01:02:03,414 --> 01:02:04,977
I know, but you're
on your feet.
You'll live,

1419
01:02:05,173 --> 01:02:05,941
and if we
get these comics,
you'll live well.

1420
01:02:06,133 --> 01:02:06,939
You and me.

1421
01:02:12,469 --> 01:02:14,128
What?

1422
01:02:14,325 --> 01:02:17,758
Mrs. cresswell,
I need you to hold
your own stomach.

1423
01:02:17,756 --> 01:02:17,852
Mrs. cresswell,
I need you to hold
your own stomach.

1424
01:02:18,044 --> 01:02:20,767
I've got to get
to the phone.

1425
01:02:20,955 --> 01:02:24,379
No. No. No.
don't leave me.

1426
01:02:24,572 --> 01:02:27,545
I'm...

1427
01:02:27,740 --> 01:02:30,137
Done.

1428
01:02:30,332 --> 01:02:32,164
Why didn't you
just sell?

1429
01:02:32,348 --> 01:02:34,419
To one or the other.
It would have
been so simple.

1430
01:02:35,996 --> 01:02:37,818
Oh, god.

1431
01:02:38,012 --> 01:02:40,668
My son wasted...

1432
01:02:40,859 --> 01:02:44,312
Himself collecting.

1433
01:02:44,507 --> 01:02:46,531
He never truly
lived his life.

1434
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:48,608
He never truly
lived his life.

1435
01:02:50,332 --> 01:02:54,935
But they were his things.
And, uh...

1436
01:02:55,132 --> 01:02:57,529
I miss him so much.

1437
01:03:00,059 --> 01:03:01,977
Listen to me.

1438
01:03:02,171 --> 01:03:05,154
I want you to take the...

1439
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:06,836
The funny books...

1440
01:03:07,035 --> 01:03:10,334
That that...

1441
01:03:10,523 --> 01:03:14,906
Motherfucker left behind.

1442
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:15,301
I want you to go to my...

1443
01:03:15,298 --> 01:03:18,434
I want you to go to my...

1444
01:03:18,625 --> 01:03:21,282
My son's room.

1445
01:03:21,474 --> 01:03:24,418
And in the closet.

1446
01:03:27,138 --> 01:03:31,521
He didn't just
collect funny books.

1447
01:03:34,019 --> 01:03:36,455
Mrs. cresswell,

1448
01:03:36,642 --> 01:03:37,630
if only I would have
just told ray--

1449
01:03:37,825 --> 01:03:38,660
hush!

1450
01:03:42,018 --> 01:03:44,071
I am... I was...

1451
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:44,223
I am... I was...

1452
01:03:44,418 --> 01:03:46,691
Getting bored anyway.

1453
01:05:08,425 --> 01:05:09,221
Hey, kiki.

1454
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:15,153
Hey, be quiet.

1455
01:05:15,342 --> 01:05:16,685
It's a little
late for that.

1456
01:05:16,879 --> 01:05:18,068
Besides, who's around
at this hour?

1457
01:05:18,255 --> 01:05:18,898
Normal,
careful of glass.

1458
01:05:19,086 --> 01:05:19,950
Ow!

1459
01:05:20,142 --> 01:05:21,063
Oh, shit.

1460
01:05:21,263 --> 01:05:22,481
Are you ok?

1461
01:05:22,671 --> 01:05:24,273
Now I'm bleeding
in 2 places!

1462
01:05:24,463 --> 01:05:27,983
All right, honey. Well,
look for a rolodex,

1463
01:05:28,175 --> 01:05:29,652
anything that might
have Carter's address,

1464
01:05:29,838 --> 01:05:31,756
a phone number, even.

1465
01:05:33,774 --> 01:05:35,184
What a palace.

1466
01:05:35,375 --> 01:05:36,209
Ow.

1467
01:05:36,399 --> 01:05:37,099
Come on, honey.

1468
01:05:43,504 --> 01:05:45,355
Found it.

1469
01:05:45,551 --> 01:05:48,045
This oughta do.
Yeah, this'll do.

1470
01:05:48,238 --> 01:05:49,744
It was hard, 'cause
there was all the--

1471
01:05:49,935 --> 01:05:52,179
the power tools
and saws and...

1472
01:05:52,367 --> 01:05:55,561
I mean,
are you fucking
the hardware guy?

1473
01:05:55,758 --> 01:05:57,168
Is it Carter's?

1474
01:05:57,359 --> 01:05:59,028
Yeah?

1475
01:05:59,215 --> 01:06:01,516
Yeah, I pretty much
figured he was
a handy kinda guy.

1476
01:06:05,743 --> 01:06:06,548
Where is he?

1477
01:06:06,735 --> 01:06:07,474
I don't know.

1478
01:06:10,165 --> 01:06:12,179
You have such
a beautiful body.

1479
01:06:14,166 --> 01:06:17,456
I saw you
at the club
dancing that day.

1480
01:06:17,653 --> 01:06:19,514
You were
so graceful.

1481
01:06:21,270 --> 01:06:22,526
But not when you
spread your legs.

1482
01:06:22,709 --> 01:06:23,793
That was--
that was obscene.

1483
01:06:23,990 --> 01:06:25,591
That was
unnecessary.

1484
01:06:28,149 --> 01:06:30,067
don't like
guys like me, do you?

1485
01:06:30,261 --> 01:06:31,738
What's it take?
Does it take money?

1486
01:06:31,926 --> 01:06:33,748
I've got money.
I've got some money.

1487
01:06:36,853 --> 01:06:38,647
You know what
I could do to you
with this hammer?

1488
01:06:38,837 --> 01:06:41,245
You wouldn't
dance anymore.

1489
01:06:45,717 --> 01:06:47,500
Where's Carter?

1490
01:06:47,701 --> 01:06:49,015
I don't know.

1491
01:06:49,206 --> 01:06:50,778
You're lying.

1492
01:06:50,965 --> 01:06:52,500
See, I wish
I could have
a girl like you--

1493
01:06:52,694 --> 01:06:53,624
beautiful and loyal.

1494
01:06:56,053 --> 01:06:57,818
I'd treat you good.

1495
01:06:58,005 --> 01:06:59,894
Oh, god.

1496
01:07:02,581 --> 01:07:05,363
I wouldn't let you
dance naked for men.

1497
01:07:08,507 --> 01:07:10,943
He's not worth it.

1498
01:07:11,132 --> 01:07:13,942
If I was your man,
I wouldn't let you
be here all alone.

1499
01:07:14,140 --> 01:07:15,358
Where is he?

1500
01:07:15,548 --> 01:07:17,025
I don't know.
I don't know.

1501
01:07:17,211 --> 01:07:18,487
don't lie to me!
don't fucking
lie to me!

1502
01:07:18,684 --> 01:07:20,448
don't fucking
lie to me!

1503
01:07:20,636 --> 01:07:23,034
I hate
girls like you!

1504
01:07:23,228 --> 01:07:24,859
Where is he?!

1505
01:07:25,052 --> 01:07:26,778
I don't know!

1506
01:07:31,772 --> 01:07:34,045
Anything yet?

1507
01:07:34,235 --> 01:07:34,239
No.

1508
01:07:34,239 --> 01:07:35,390
No.

1509
01:07:35,579 --> 01:07:37,497
All right,
keep looking.

1510
01:07:37,692 --> 01:07:39,677
See, I'm startin'
to feel dizzy.

1511
01:07:41,660 --> 01:07:44,537
Listen, we'll go
to the hospital soon,
lover, ok?

1512
01:07:46,011 --> 01:07:47,316
I feel tingly.

1513
01:07:47,516 --> 01:07:50,240
Soon. Just search
the counter.

1514
01:07:50,428 --> 01:07:51,895
It's the first place
I looked.

1515
01:07:52,092 --> 01:07:53,434
Keep looking!

1516
01:07:53,627 --> 01:07:55,737
Maybe I'll...

1517
01:07:55,932 --> 01:07:58,492
Look underneath.
Maybe something fell underneath.

1518
01:08:06,178 --> 01:08:08,393
Ow! Ow! Ow!

1519
01:08:08,579 --> 01:08:09,950
What is it?!

1520
01:08:10,146 --> 01:08:12,869
The counter! I think
it broke my foot!

1521
01:08:13,057 --> 01:08:15,426
Oh, aah! Honey!

1522
01:08:15,618 --> 01:08:17,181
Come on, honey. Just try
and wiggle it free.

1523
01:08:17,378 --> 01:08:19,459
No! No--aah!
No wiggling!

1524
01:08:19,650 --> 01:08:21,990
Please,
just wiggle.
I'm pinned.

1525
01:08:22,178 --> 01:08:24,067
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1526
01:08:24,258 --> 01:08:25,275
Put that fire out.

1527
01:08:25,474 --> 01:08:26,788
That could spread.

1528
01:08:26,978 --> 01:08:28,388
I think I saw
a fire extinguisher.

1529
01:08:28,578 --> 01:08:29,921
Hurry up, honey!
It's starting to spread!

1530
01:08:32,002 --> 01:08:33,767
Ow!

1531
01:08:33,954 --> 01:08:35,738
I'm coming, honey!

1532
01:08:35,938 --> 01:08:36,907
Damn it! I'm stuck!

1533
01:08:39,522 --> 01:08:40,452
Aah!

1534
01:08:42,947 --> 01:08:46,179
Damn lazy bastard
didn't keep
the pressure up.

1535
01:08:50,178 --> 01:08:50,945
Hey, I'm really
stuck, Judy.

1536
01:08:52,578 --> 01:08:54,170
Shit. Honey,
the line is dead.

1537
01:08:56,770 --> 01:08:58,266
All right, I'm gonna try
freeing you again, baby.

1538
01:08:58,466 --> 01:08:59,396
Come on.

1539
01:09:01,321 --> 01:09:03,277
It's really starting
to get hot, Judy. Hurry up.

1540
01:09:03,464 --> 01:09:06,342
Ok. I have to find
a pay phone, ok? Ok.

1541
01:09:08,777 --> 01:09:10,177
No. No. No.
don't leave me here!

1542
01:09:11,593 --> 01:09:13,387
If you leave me, I'll burn.

1543
01:09:13,577 --> 01:09:15,303
It's really
getting hot, Judy!
I don't wanna burn!

1544
01:09:22,984 --> 01:09:24,710
I don't wanna burn, Judy!

1545
01:09:24,904 --> 01:09:27,081
Oh, please.

1546
01:10:40,207 --> 01:10:43,602
Oh, I'm sorry.
Am I interrupting you?
Reading by the fire?

1547
01:10:43,792 --> 01:10:44,942
You fucking weirdo!

1548
01:10:46,863 --> 01:10:48,206
Back in high school,
you were so mean.

1549
01:10:48,399 --> 01:10:50,355
Weren't you, lone wolf?

1550
01:10:50,543 --> 01:10:52,778
You used to scare
the jocks shitless.

1551
01:10:52,974 --> 01:10:55,602
But you always
liked comic books.

1552
01:10:55,797 --> 01:10:58,894
See, that part,
that part
I should've remembered.

1553
01:10:59,093 --> 01:11:00,925
Used to have
quite a collection.

1554
01:11:01,109 --> 01:11:03,660
Yeah. You used
to take most of mine.

1555
01:11:05,428 --> 01:11:08,152
So, how'd you find me?

1556
01:11:08,341 --> 01:11:10,998
Oh, your
girlfriend kiki.

1557
01:11:11,188 --> 01:11:13,845
I went down by the club,
and she gave me
a little dance.

1558
01:11:15,861 --> 01:11:18,326
We got to talking,
and I asked,
and she told me.

1559
01:11:20,117 --> 01:11:21,901
What are you reading?

1560
01:11:22,101 --> 01:11:24,346
Avengers
#4.

1561
01:11:26,197 --> 01:11:27,981
First modern appearance
of captain America.

1562
01:11:28,181 --> 01:11:30,204
I know.

1563
01:11:30,388 --> 01:11:32,460
That's $1, 000 book
you got there.
You better be careful.

1564
01:11:32,661 --> 01:11:34,062
The moisture
from your fingertips

1565
01:11:34,261 --> 01:11:35,805
is devaluing it
as we speak.

1566
01:11:38,358 --> 01:11:39,509
Where's the rest
of the books?

1567
01:11:39,702 --> 01:11:41,840
Still in the truck.

1568
01:11:42,037 --> 01:11:43,610
Catch my breath.

1569
01:11:46,389 --> 01:11:48,950
You know, as I was
drivin' over here,

1570
01:11:49,141 --> 01:11:52,373
I began remembering
reading comic books
back when, and, uh...

1571
01:11:55,196 --> 01:11:57,948
All the facts
and figures...

1572
01:11:58,139 --> 01:12:01,822
About superpowers,

1573
01:12:02,012 --> 01:12:03,354
secret identities

1574
01:12:03,548 --> 01:12:06,588
we took the time
to memorize.

1575
01:12:08,156 --> 01:12:09,624
That some of us
still do.

1576
01:12:09,819 --> 01:12:12,121
Sometimes I think
if I woulda spent

1577
01:12:12,316 --> 01:12:14,109
just an eighth
of the time studying,

1578
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:18,366
say, physics equations,
rather than comic book trivia,

1579
01:12:18,555 --> 01:12:20,569
I'd probably have won
the nobel prize. Huh?

1580
01:12:20,764 --> 01:12:21,761
Hmm.

1581
01:12:23,259 --> 01:12:25,245
So, uh...

1582
01:12:25,436 --> 01:12:28,764
Kiki just
gave me up, huh?

1583
01:12:30,587 --> 01:12:32,534
She didn't even lie.
She said, "oh, Carter?

1584
01:12:32,732 --> 01:12:35,292
Oh, yeah. I'll tell you
where he is."

1585
01:12:40,732 --> 01:12:41,787
Sorry.

1586
01:12:44,668 --> 01:12:46,807
So...

1587
01:12:47,003 --> 01:12:47,770
What now?

1588
01:12:47,963 --> 01:12:50,725
What now?

1589
01:12:50,722 --> 01:12:50,751
What now?

1590
01:12:50,946 --> 01:12:53,765
I have a gun. Ok?

1591
01:12:53,953 --> 01:12:55,584
And my hand's
not shaking anymore.

1592
01:12:55,777 --> 01:12:56,995
Not now.

1593
01:12:57,186 --> 01:12:58,692
And I want your gun.

1594
01:13:00,673 --> 01:13:01,565
What gun?

1595
01:13:01,763 --> 01:13:03,201
don't fuck with me!

1596
01:13:03,394 --> 01:13:04,708
I see you have
a gun right there!

1597
01:13:04,898 --> 01:13:07,142
In the back
of your pants, Carter.

1598
01:13:10,273 --> 01:13:13,467
Aah! Ah! Ah! Ah ha ha!
Ha! Slowly!

1599
01:13:15,970 --> 01:13:16,766
Toss it.

1600
01:13:21,858 --> 01:13:23,162
Ok, up. Let's go.

1601
01:13:31,362 --> 01:13:32,762
Why don't you lead?

1602
01:13:34,050 --> 01:13:35,843
Ok. You're the boss.

1603
01:13:37,986 --> 01:13:38,916
Watch that cable.

1604
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:00,134
Motherfucker.

1605
01:14:07,752 --> 01:14:09,421
Aah! Aah!

1606
01:14:15,496 --> 01:14:17,040
Aah!

1607
01:14:17,036 --> 01:14:17,352
Aah!

1608
01:14:17,545 --> 01:14:18,696
Aw.

1609
01:14:18,889 --> 01:14:20,778
Macgillicuddy
fall down.

1610
01:14:26,024 --> 01:14:27,022
Ungh!

1611
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:40,164
Ha!

1612
01:14:46,895 --> 01:14:47,633
Aah!

1613
01:14:57,839 --> 01:15:01,743
Aah! Aah!

1614
01:15:19,662 --> 01:15:20,976
Son of a bitch!

1615
01:15:21,167 --> 01:15:21,810
What the fuck
are you doin'?!

1616
01:15:29,647 --> 01:15:31,949
Son of a bitch! Aah!

1617
01:16:09,365 --> 01:16:12,118
Aw, shit!

1618
01:16:12,121 --> 01:16:12,409
Aw, shit!

1619
01:16:14,805 --> 01:16:15,860
Jesus!

1620
01:16:17,910 --> 01:16:20,432
Son of a bitch!

1621
01:16:38,165 --> 01:16:40,889
You son of a bitch!

1622
01:16:41,084 --> 01:16:42,522
If you'd only
done as I asked,
we'd both be rich.

1623
01:16:42,716 --> 01:16:44,922
But no! No!

1624
01:16:45,116 --> 01:16:47,647
See, I would have
been somebody.

1625
01:16:47,835 --> 01:16:49,945
But you...

1626
01:16:51,899 --> 01:16:53,050
Who--who--who
were you gonna
sell 'em to, huh?

1627
01:16:53,243 --> 01:16:55,641
They're comics,
you ass!

1628
01:16:55,836 --> 01:16:58,272
I remember them
from when I was a kid.

1629
01:16:58,460 --> 01:16:59,831
I didn't need you.

1630
01:17:00,028 --> 01:17:01,725
Oh! Ok! Oh, yeah!

1631
01:17:01,916 --> 01:17:03,930
You're a fucking
encyclopedia
about comics.

1632
01:17:04,124 --> 01:17:07,519
You're the oracle
of delphi on comics!
Please! Please!

1633
01:17:07,708 --> 01:17:09,309
First appearance
of superman.

1634
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:09,663
Uh,
action comics
#1.

1635
01:17:09,663 --> 01:17:11,706
Uh,
action comics
#1.

1636
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:12,993
Everyone knows that.

1637
01:17:13,180 --> 01:17:15,002
Batman.

1638
01:17:15,196 --> 01:17:17,469
Uh...
Detective comics
27.

1639
01:17:17,660 --> 01:17:19,453
Spider-man.

1640
01:17:19,643 --> 01:17:20,986
Uh,
spider man
#1.

1641
01:17:21,179 --> 01:17:22,359
Uh-uh.

1642
01:17:22,556 --> 01:17:24,291
Oh, wait. Wait.
Uh, uh...

1643
01:17:24,476 --> 01:17:27,161
Amazing fantasy
15.

1644
01:17:27,356 --> 01:17:29,628
Golden age flash.

1645
01:17:29,819 --> 01:17:31,478
Flash comics
#1.

1646
01:17:31,676 --> 01:17:33,316
Silver age flash.

1647
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:35,447
Showcase
4.

1648
01:17:35,644 --> 01:17:38,434
Uh, uh,
the human torch.

1649
01:17:38,434 --> 01:17:38,722
Uh, uh,
the human torch.

1650
01:17:38,914 --> 01:17:41,829
Human torch...
Fantastic four
#1.

1651
01:17:42,018 --> 01:17:44,387
No! I am
talking about
the 1940's torch.

1652
01:17:44,578 --> 01:17:46,717
Oh. Oh. Uh...

1653
01:17:46,914 --> 01:17:49,120
Marvel mystery
#1.

1654
01:17:49,314 --> 01:17:50,819
Wonder woman.

1655
01:17:51,010 --> 01:17:53,926
Wonder woman.
Wonder woman.
Wonder woman.

1656
01:17:54,114 --> 01:17:54,948
Sensation
1.

1657
01:17:55,138 --> 01:17:56,797
Ahh! Wrong!

1658
01:17:59,746 --> 01:18:03,141
No. No. Wait.
I'm right.

1659
01:18:03,330 --> 01:18:04,865
It's definitely
sensation
1.

1660
01:18:05,058 --> 01:18:07,207
Wrong! Wrong!

1661
01:18:07,206 --> 01:18:07,397
Wrong! Wrong!

1662
01:18:07,585 --> 01:18:10,146
Well, it's not
wonder woman
#1,

1663
01:18:10,338 --> 01:18:11,517
if that's what
you're thinking.

1664
01:18:11,714 --> 01:18:12,932
What are you
trying to do?

1665
01:18:13,122 --> 01:18:14,273
Are you trying
to insult me?

1666
01:18:14,466 --> 01:18:16,135
Do you
think I'm stupid?

1667
01:18:16,322 --> 01:18:18,307
I'm standing here
before you.
You think I'm stupid?

1668
01:18:18,498 --> 01:18:19,774
Wonder woman first
appeared in
all star
8,

1669
01:18:19,969 --> 01:18:21,379
a justice society
backup story.

1670
01:18:21,570 --> 01:18:22,846
So either you're
trying to patronize me,

1671
01:18:23,042 --> 01:18:24,577
or you're trying
to fuck with me,

1672
01:18:24,769 --> 01:18:26,314
or you're trying
to get yourself killed.

1673
01:18:26,498 --> 01:18:28,675
And, by the way,
you're doing
a very good job.

1674
01:18:28,866 --> 01:18:29,921
No, wait.

1675
01:18:35,682 --> 01:18:35,980
And the bullets
didn't even bounce
off your chest.

1676
01:18:35,977 --> 01:18:38,796
And the bullets
didn't even bounce
off your chest.

1677
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:30,215
Hi.

1678
01:19:32,744 --> 01:19:33,521
Who is it?

1679
01:19:33,519 --> 01:19:34,258
Who is it?

1680
01:19:36,367 --> 01:19:38,860
It's me,
ray macgillicuddy

1681
01:19:40,302 --> 01:19:41,875
what do you want?

1682
01:19:44,815 --> 01:19:47,145
Some polite
conversation.

1683
01:19:54,094 --> 01:19:56,214
Drink?

1684
01:19:57,391 --> 01:19:58,129
Yeah.

1685
01:20:10,959 --> 01:20:12,781
I don't drink.

1686
01:20:22,127 --> 01:20:23,633
I don't smoke.

1687
01:20:28,847 --> 01:20:29,873
Ok.

1688
01:20:30,063 --> 01:20:31,061
Come on.
Come on.

1689
01:20:31,062 --> 01:20:32,951
Come on.
Come on.

1690
01:20:36,245 --> 01:20:38,739
My store's on fire.

1691
01:20:40,021 --> 01:20:41,431
It was an accident.

1692
01:20:41,622 --> 01:20:43,319
It's ok.

1693
01:20:43,509 --> 01:20:44,948
It's ok.
These things happen.

1694
01:20:51,894 --> 01:20:54,426
I killed a man tonight.

1695
01:20:56,468 --> 01:20:57,466
Me, too.

1696
01:21:01,268 --> 01:21:02,228
Did yours
deserve it?

1697
01:21:04,981 --> 01:21:07,637
Yes. Yes, he did.

1698
01:21:09,845 --> 01:21:11,351
Did yours?

1699
01:21:28,533 --> 01:21:28,600
Remember that feeling?

1700
01:21:28,604 --> 01:21:30,560
Remember that feeling?

1701
01:21:30,747 --> 01:21:33,557
That feeling
when the hunt
became everything.

1702
01:21:35,260 --> 01:21:37,561
Just the comics
and us hating you

1703
01:21:37,756 --> 01:21:39,137
and you hating us.

1704
01:21:40,892 --> 01:21:45,122
And food and sex
and deep breaths,

1705
01:21:45,308 --> 01:21:48,185
everything felt better.

1706
01:21:50,171 --> 01:21:53,182
I remember food
tasting really good.

1707
01:21:55,100 --> 01:21:56,510
All because
of comic books.

1708
01:22:03,932 --> 01:22:06,263
It was rude
to run you over.

1709
01:22:06,459 --> 01:22:08,991
Yeah. I oughta...

1710
01:22:09,179 --> 01:22:11,452
I oughta get ya
for that one! Aah!

1711
01:22:16,763 --> 01:22:18,518
Whoo!

1712
01:22:18,716 --> 01:22:20,826
Oh!

1713
01:22:24,507 --> 01:22:26,147
My ride's here.

1714
01:22:26,146 --> 01:22:26,655
My ride's here.

1715
01:22:32,322 --> 01:22:34,240
I gotta go.

1716
01:22:34,434 --> 01:22:37,829
I've got nothing left,
and I've got no reason to stay.

1717
01:22:39,458 --> 01:22:40,609
Are you comin'?

1718
01:22:42,658 --> 01:22:45,248
Ah, the store's
open late.

1719
01:22:45,442 --> 01:22:47,332
If they come in,
maybe they'll
buy something.

1720
01:22:50,659 --> 01:22:51,646
It's a nice shop.

1721
01:23:44,936 --> 01:23:46,854
Summer was
a hot one that year.

1722
01:23:47,048 --> 01:23:48,458
It came about
a month later,

1723
01:23:48,649 --> 01:23:51,497
hotter than hell.

1724
01:23:51,688 --> 01:23:52,455
All the worse for
the guys I knew.

1725
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:54,378
All the worse for
the guys I knew.

1726
01:23:54,568 --> 01:23:55,911
They had to make the trek
to the next town

1727
01:23:56,104 --> 01:23:57,447
for their comic books now,

1728
01:23:57,640 --> 01:24:00,968
with Raymond dead
and Judy in jail.

1729
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:03,433
It made me sad so few
of Raymond's customers

1730
01:24:03,625 --> 01:24:05,869
came to his funeral.

1731
01:24:06,056 --> 01:24:07,783
You'd have thought
he mattered more to people,

1732
01:24:07,976 --> 01:24:10,796
but I guess he knew better,

1733
01:24:10,984 --> 01:24:13,506
especially at the end.

1734
01:24:13,705 --> 01:24:15,661
When the town did get
a new comic store,

1735
01:24:15,848 --> 01:24:17,603
it made sense
who'd run it.

1736
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:20,169
Conan's mom had money.

1737
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:21,233
I just never guessed
how much.

1738
01:24:21,231 --> 01:24:22,411
I just never guessed
how much.

1739
01:24:22,606 --> 01:24:26,328
Not that I cared by then.
I had money, too.

1740
01:24:26,512 --> 01:24:27,720
And I was long gone.

1741
01:24:29,679 --> 01:24:32,010
I'd done what
Mrs. cresswell had told me.

1742
01:24:32,206 --> 01:24:36,560
I looked in her son's closet
and found baseball cards.

1743
01:24:36,750 --> 01:24:40,078
Robinson, koufax,
mays, mantle,

1744
01:24:40,271 --> 01:24:42,803
and a million other names
I never even heard of--

1745
01:24:42,991 --> 01:24:45,456
together worth more than
even the comic books.

1746
01:24:47,055 --> 01:24:48,331
The thing is,

1747
01:24:48,526 --> 01:24:50,003
I don't like baseball...

1748
01:24:50,002 --> 01:24:51,345
I don't like baseball...

1749
01:24:51,535 --> 01:24:53,424
So I sold them.

1750
01:24:55,246 --> 01:24:58,958
Does that make me
as bad as the others?

1751
01:24:59,152 --> 01:25:02,643
I don't know.
I don't know.

1752
01:25:08,526 --> 01:25:09,610
But at least
I did something

1753
01:25:09,808 --> 01:25:11,313
with the money,

1754
01:25:11,502 --> 01:25:14,130
like I think Mrs. cresswell
would have wanted.

1755
01:25:14,319 --> 01:25:15,815
After all that had happened,

1756
01:25:16,014 --> 01:25:18,230
life and the living of it
seemed too fleeting

1757
01:25:18,415 --> 01:25:18,770
to waste in one place...

1758
01:25:18,774 --> 01:25:20,538
To waste in one place...

1759
01:25:20,725 --> 01:25:22,739
Or on arguing
whether superman

1760
01:25:22,933 --> 01:25:24,851
was stronger
than the hulk.

1761
01:25:25,046 --> 01:25:28,115
So I traveled.

1762
01:25:28,309 --> 01:25:31,004
First America,
then Europe...

1763
01:25:31,189 --> 01:25:33,203
Really taking my time
at each place

1764
01:25:33,397 --> 01:25:35,766
learning and growing,

1765
01:25:35,958 --> 01:25:39,794
but always knowing where
I'd eventually settle down.

1766
01:25:41,558 --> 01:25:43,543
Barcelona.

1767
01:25:47,094 --> 01:25:47,545
They have comics here, too.

1768
01:25:47,545 --> 01:25:50,105
They have comics here, too.

1769
01:25:50,293 --> 01:25:51,924
But I can't understand them.

1770
01:25:51,948 --> 01:26:13,948
