1
00:00:00,066 --> 00:00:02,000
First, I'd Iike to thank the peopIe
at CJ Entertainment, Sidus Pictures,
& Premier Entertainment

2
00:00:02,102 --> 00:00:04,195
I aIso wouId Iike to thank the actors
and the crew for their effort and dedication.
for making the Director's Cut possibIe.

3
00:00:04,304 --> 00:00:06,465
The birth of Director's Cut might imbue
a certain type of perception
that the pre-existing TheatricaI Version
was not what the director intended.

4
00:00:06,573 --> 00:00:08,973
However, it is not true in this case.
The TheatricaI Version was edited by
the director as weII as the Director's Cut.

5
00:00:09,075 --> 00:00:11,475
I hope the narrative's newIy-achieved
expansiveness adds to the
emotionaI impact of the originaI
TheatricaI Version.

00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:22,710
A Moment To Remember

9
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:40,192
Hey...

10
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:44,103
Can l burn a light?

11
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:59,878
No, not that, Got a light?

12
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:10,791
When a memory's gone...

13
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,794
So is the soul, they say.

14
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:21,804
Ah, memory!

15
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:26,810
When a memory's go
so is the soul.

16
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:34,577
Some story, eh?

17
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:40,591
Hey, man, let me tell you
a story about memory.

18
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,887
When you were walking
towards me.

19
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:47,295
l saw you smoking.

20
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:49,897
That's a memory.

21
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:56,101
You know
what l'm awaiting here?

22
00:02:57,944 --> 00:02:59,809
Not a cigarette light.

23
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:03,110
l'm waiting for the light.

24
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:08,781
Sharing a cigarette light
means sharing the light.

25
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:10,582
So...

26
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,494
Hey Miss...

27
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:20,194
Got a light?

28
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,742
When will l ever smoke this?

29
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:38,281
The train is now approaching.

30
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:42,377
PIease wait behind the yeIIow Iine.

31
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:02,863
70 cents.

32
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:13,910
You gave me a dollar.

33
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:18,614
Damn, not again.

34
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:27,419
Here you go.

35
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,572
Hurry.

36
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:59,482
Come on!

37
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:09,455
You must've been in a hurry.

38
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,565
So you're through with him?

39
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:54,270
What did l tell you?

40
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:56,375
l knew it!

41
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:00,577
Did you eat dinner?
Are you hungry?

42
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:03,945
Dad's gonna kill you!

43
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:41,644
ls that her?

44
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:49,351
She doesn't look
stupid or anything.

45
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:52,355
Look at those eyes.

46
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:55,130
Totally foxy.

47
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:02,165
- Do you like your desk?
- Yes

48
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:05,072
Welcome to our team.
How about a fresh start on the new floor?

49
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:11,750
Being such a feminine
and sensitive woman as you are...

50
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,647
Can you do men's wear?

51
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:18,154
You should help me.
l'll learn.

52
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:21,393
l bet you will.

53
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:27,357
You look just perfect
for the job.

54
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:30,361
l'm Anna JUNG

55
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:37,369
Nice to meet you,
l'm KlM Su-jin.

56
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:40,070
l've heard a lot about you.

57
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:45,142
From Young-min,
your ex-boyfriend's wife.

58
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:47,183
She and l went to college together.

59
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:53,116
Oh, She's not his wife anymore.

60
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:04,334
Here?

61
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,630
Shorter.

62
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:07,932
Here?

63
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:10,542
You sure?

64
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,940
l don't get it.

65
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:19,814
Getting a cut doesn't help
forget the past.

66
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,113
Wait!

67
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,219
Right here.

68
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:35,423
Don't get caught up in it.

69
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:38,435
Time heals everything.

70
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:10,825
Feels so good
going out with my little girl.

71
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:20,241
Don't you hate me?

72
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:24,915
l've given
the family a bad name.

73
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:29,018
You had to go to police station
many times because of me...

74
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:33,421
l did?

75
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:40,530
To forget easily is a gift.

76
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:46,727
Let go of your old mistakes.

77
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,840
Make a fresh start.

78
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:05,817
lt won't take long.
Want to come along?

79
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,823
Go ahead.

80
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:11,229
So dusty!

81
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:27,269
With the sIeepy spring breeze
aII around you...

82
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:29,347
Here's a song to wake you up.

83
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:31,643
I'II be back tomorrow.
And this is the Iast song for today.

84
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:33,149
La PaIoma.

85
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:54,634
What's wrong with you?

86
00:12:54,807 --> 00:13:00,143
lf we don't finish this right now,
what are you gonna do with it?

87
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:03,281
Am l talking to a wall?

88
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:08,182
We're talking in circles.
Stop wasting my time!

89
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:10,447
- You son of a...
- What's the matter?

90
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:11,757
Sir!

91
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:14,817
The cement trucks are all here.

92
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,020
But this jerk here won't let
them do their job.

93
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:23,033
Do you know what it'll cost us
if we send them back?

94
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:27,537
Fine, go ahead, Pour the whole shit!
lt won't be my mess.

95
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:30,540
Don't come crying to me later.
Damn it!

96
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:34,737
What the...
Who does he think he is?

97
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,213
Wait...
You're the foreman, right?

98
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:41,410
What's your name?

99
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:45,617
That's the 30th time you've asked!
lt's CHOl Chul-soo.

100
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:48,318
l'm sorry, Choi

101
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,620
What's the problem?

102
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:52,553
Problem?

103
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:56,360
The mold isn't strong enough
to hold the concrete.

104
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:59,631
- Damn!
- lt rained like hell last week.

105
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:03,435
And we're not even done
with the scaffolding.

106
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:08,104
What if it collapses
after people move in?

107
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,407
Collapse? Don't jinx it, boy!

108
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:14,007
Okay, Choi.
Let me take a look.

109
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:32,336
No way we can finish this
by tomorrow morning.

110
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:38,935
Do it the day after tomorrow
for your own sake.

111
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:42,343
You don't know
what you're talking about.

112
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:44,915
You're a frigging carpenter!

113
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:52,317
Look, l'm telling you this
from my experience.

114
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:55,427
Do it today
and it will collapse.

115
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,620
Do you want to be
on the prime-time news?

116
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,723
Some temper he has!

117
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:31,329
Who?

118
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:33,925
Let's go eat.

119
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,426
l thought the renovations
would be done by now.

120
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,520
l'm screwed!

121
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:07,232
They'll fire me.

122
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:11,427
l had my buddy do the project
but he took the money and ran.

123
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,630
Damn, l already paid him.

124
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:16,434
Jesus.

125
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:21,337
Let me see what l can do.

126
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,812
There might be a way.

127
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:24,916
Really?

128
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:26,811
How?

129
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:32,519
l know some people.

130
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,819
Dad, are you sure?

131
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:38,418
Of course! l'm your favorite
pushover, am l not?

132
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:41,533
No, you're not a pushover!
You're my Christmas!

133
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:42,634
What?

134
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,433
l mean Santa Claus!

135
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:49,541
Enough.
l'll send someone over.

136
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,041
Let the guys deal with him.

137
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,542
Okay?

138
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,147
He's... rough, Very violent.

139
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:58,306
Don't mess with him.

140
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,537
So glad you made it!

141
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:29,046
Let's have some coffee
in my office.

142
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:31,108
Where's the site?

143
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,315
This way.

144
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,722
Where's the floor plan?

145
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,727
We don't have any
The guy ran off.

146
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:48,924
Why's the wallpaper torn?

147
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:54,831
Hey! Pardon... What the! Wait!

148
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:56,634
Leave it please!
We're out of time here.

149
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:59,938
This is what you call a slapdash job.
The whole wall has to go.

150
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:53,932
Walking home?

151
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,035
Yes... No!

152
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:08,045
l'm taking the bus... No, taxi...
l'm taking a taxi.

153
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:06,538
Are you okay?

154
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:08,139
Yes.

155
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,239
You sell these
on the subway or something?

156
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:16,245
These are all here?
l lose pens all the time.

157
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,611
Won't it cost money
to fix the door?

158
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:29,111
Get in through here.

159
00:21:38,263 --> 00:21:40,026
Wait! Wait!

160
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,231
Hold onto this.

161
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:45,336
Okay

162
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:48,172
Comfortable?

163
00:22:57,409 --> 00:22:59,775
What's the baseball bat for?

164
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:02,778
Do you beat up
people with it?

165
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:07,051
Why would you
beat up people?

166
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:13,751
l'm sorry.

167
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:17,061
For what?

168
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:20,464
For snatching your coke.

169
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:27,161
l'm, you know...
l'm very... uh, very...

170
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:29,874
Forgetful!

171
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:35,275
How'd you remember
me anyway?

172
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:37,948
ls this the exit?

173
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:58,265
Hey, you're seeing
somebody today, right?

174
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:01,773
Don't you dare
pick up a hunk alone.

175
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:02,965
Hunk?

176
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:06,642
All you girls talk about...

177
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:40,075
Looking for someone?

178
00:24:42,714 --> 00:24:45,649
Well, where is...

179
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:49,446
That tall mustachio?

180
00:24:50,388 --> 00:24:52,549
He's working on the site
so couldn't come.

181
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:55,353
People down here are
in charge now, l heard.

182
00:24:59,397 --> 00:25:02,059
Thank you so much
Su-jin.

183
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:04,766
Your father plays golf, right?

184
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:06,461
l'll give a call later.

185
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:52,340
- What are you doing?
- Jesus! Oh God!

186
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,874
What hunks?
l don't even see ghosts.

187
00:26:17,008 --> 00:26:18,475
l have to go pee!

188
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,976
- She has to go pee!
- Be quiet.!

189
00:26:21,112 --> 00:26:24,548
Trust me on this, okay?
Let's go.

190
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:31,055
Mr. Park is a jerk.

191
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:33,157
He never pays on time.

192
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:35,657
You should push the prick
to save our asses.

193
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:38,353
He'll pay on time this month.

194
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:42,566
l don't care about the style.

195
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:45,670
What kind of business
are they in?

196
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:47,271
Oh, is that where we're going?

197
00:26:47,405 --> 00:26:49,464
Do you have any savings at all?

198
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:53,976
Stop spending start saving.

199
00:26:54,512 --> 00:26:57,845
And it's about time you
Ghi-bong got married~~

200
00:26:58,483 --> 00:27:00,849
You know these guys?

201
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,448
How's the business?

202
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,552
What?

203
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:09,956
Selling pens.

204
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:18,360
We were just walking by.

205
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:24,271
We have an appointment...
And l saw you.

206
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,574
Sit here, ladies.

207
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:34,151
We need more glasses
and chopsticks here!

208
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,647
Get the chairs!

209
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:45,253
Haven't you seen enough
of his face tonight?

210
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,363
Kim Su-jin!

211
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:55,969
Get me a plane!
l'm getting goose bumps!

212
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:58,166
Why don't you move in
with him?

213
00:27:58,309 --> 00:28:04,839
He has a lot of money
put aside.

214
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:27,972
lf you drink that
we're going steady.

215
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,268
lf l don't?

216
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:38,339
We will be strangers.
Until we die.

217
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:44,438
Me? l've never
done this before.

218
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:48,043
Spread them.

219
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:50,547
Keep low.

220
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:59,226
Swing like this.

221
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:08,363
Oh my...

222
00:30:08,506 --> 00:30:10,974
Pick up the bat!

223
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,573
God!

224
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:18,439
lt's too heavy.

225
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:20,050
The ball's coming!

226
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:24,050
Keep your eye on the ball.

227
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:28,354
lt's already gone!

228
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:56,515
What do you have on?

229
00:30:57,155 --> 00:30:59,817
Beats me.

230
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:05,921
This smell gives me
a strange feeling.

231
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:08,327
Reminds me of the old days.

232
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:14,730
Was it my dad?
My uncle?

233
00:31:15,673 --> 00:31:17,231
The smell makes me feel...

234
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:25,009
as if l were falling
into a world of dreams...

235
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:28,118
- Hey
- ...Something like that...

236
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:29,914
l got it from a barber.

237
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:35,619
What's this?

238
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,920
What?

239
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:38,321
This?

240
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:40,125
Nothing!

241
00:31:54,979 --> 00:31:57,209
You study?
Taking a test or something?

242
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:05,115
Hey!

243
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:07,921
Open it
and you're out of here.

244
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:18,231
Who's this?
Your grandfather?

245
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:21,433
A master templum lignarius...

246
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:23,840
What's that?

247
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:26,842
A man who builds temples.
He was my teacher.

248
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:29,538
Got an album?
Any childhood pictures?

249
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,116
Have you got
an insatiable curiosity?

250
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:41,919
l want to see your pictures
when you were little.

251
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,125
l haven't got any.

252
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:46,127
l've always been
a grown-up.

253
00:32:57,775 --> 00:32:58,742
You know this grift?

254
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:06,307
Place your bets.

255
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:08,316
Even a dog
at a glance can win.

256
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:10,421
Mommy wins bread money.
Daddy wins cigarette money.

257
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:12,216
Double up your money.

258
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:13,415
Don't let your luck slip by...

259
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:15,219
The luck is right in your hands.

260
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,123
Pick an Ace!

261
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:41,040
Here we go again.
Place your bets.

262
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:43,380
Even a dog
at a glance can win.

263
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:45,854
Mommy wins bread money.
Daddy wins cigarette money.

264
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:48,151
Double up your money.

265
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:49,554
Don't let your luck slip by...

266
00:33:49,827 --> 00:33:52,057
The luck is right in your hands.

267
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:21,420
You been lost again?

268
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,117
Anything good happened to you?

269
00:34:25,863 --> 00:34:28,229
You got the strite interval right.

270
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:30,834
lt's softer than the imported fabric.

271
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:34,028
But l don't know
what Anna Jung will say.

272
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:35,639
Always finding flaws.

273
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:37,638
She's just so nasty.

274
00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:39,334
Don't worry.

275
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:42,037
A busy bird has
no time to be upset.

276
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:45,513
Who said that?
That was...

277
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,413
Young-min's phrase.

278
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:49,110
How is he doing?

279
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:51,118
l haven't seen him for a while.

280
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,125
lt's alright.

281
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:06,327
lt can happen to anybody.

282
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:09,433
All we did was love.

283
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:14,333
...say some irresponsible people.

284
00:36:15,973 --> 00:36:19,136
Nothing can stop me from love?

285
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:20,539
Love my ass.

286
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:24,808
Hey, what happens to the frog
that got hit by the careless stone?

287
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,318
What frog?

288
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:32,720
You said there was a kid?

289
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:41,360
Hey, not only killing people
or stealing things is a sin?

290
00:36:42,466 --> 00:36:45,731
lt's as much a sin to that kid.

291
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,634
Who'll take care of
the hurt he got?

292
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:53,534
l'm the frog too!

293
00:36:57,949 --> 00:36:59,416
Whatever, damn.

294
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:12,422
Let's go eat.

295
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:20,335
You're right.

296
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:23,637
l knew that too.

297
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:26,734
lt's all my fault.

298
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,109
So l'm heart-broken too.

299
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:33,410
l'm so sorry for everyone.

300
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:38,214
- But...
- Forget it.

301
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,125
Okay?

302
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:50,028
Croak, croak.

303
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,130
Croak.

304
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:14,523
Why don't you buy one?
We'll pay.

305
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:16,923
This is fun.

306
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:19,120
And good for strengthening
our friendship.

307
00:38:19,263 --> 00:38:24,633
Of all the cool guys
why a carpenter?

308
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:35,340
Grateful?

309
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:41,616
Don't wait.

310
00:39:03,207 --> 00:39:06,176
A true artist fears
a blank canvas.

311
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:08,140
Good luck, guys.

312
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:54,815
What are you doing here?

313
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:57,017
l told you not to wait.

314
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:17,106
Seeing anyone lately?

315
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:20,314
No!

316
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:25,915
lt's Yoon- ah, isn't it?

317
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:31,016
No, no.
She told me nothing.

318
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:40,635
A construction worker
or something?

319
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:44,935
Come on, why would
l go out with such a...

320
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:46,736
What does he do?

321
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,209
He's an architect.

322
00:40:51,348 --> 00:40:52,815
Really?

323
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:54,813
Let's meet him.

324
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,318
No way.

325
00:40:58,255 --> 00:40:59,415
No way?

326
00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:05,018
No, l'm just saying...

327
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:07,523
No way?

328
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:11,526
lt's just... Dad!

329
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:14,637
lnvite him over to our house

330
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:17,332
l'll take care of everything
for you.

331
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,636
Okay?

332
00:41:27,618 --> 00:41:28,482
Hell no.

333
00:41:28,552 --> 00:41:29,610
Why not?

334
00:41:29,753 --> 00:41:31,220
No!

335
00:41:31,355 --> 00:41:32,515
Why?

336
00:41:35,459 --> 00:41:36,926
Why not?

337
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:43,826
Look.

338
00:41:44,268 --> 00:41:46,930
l'm seeing you. What has that
got to do with your parents?

339
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:50,035
You have to meet them...

340
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:54,239
if we're going to get married.

341
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:02,811
Why no?
Don't you love me?

342
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,516
You love me, right?

343
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:09,519
lt may fade away.

344
00:42:13,163 --> 00:42:15,631
ls it that hard to say
l love you?

345
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:17,333
l'm getting tired of this!

346
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:19,436
Wake up, will you?

347
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:21,128
You're a princess,
and l'm a beggar!

348
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:23,240
Can you live without me?

349
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:26,775
lf we live together...
can we die together too?

350
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:32,816
You come and go alone.
That's life.

351
00:42:37,955 --> 00:42:41,118
You crybaby...

352
00:42:41,258 --> 00:42:44,022
Have you lost your parents?
Or your country?

353
00:42:44,161 --> 00:42:45,321
Look.

354
00:42:46,163 --> 00:42:48,028
Why do you like me
so much?

355
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:54,030
Remember that store?

356
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:57,536
No, l don't.

357
00:43:02,379 --> 00:43:03,346
Go away.

358
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:05,713
l'm so scared!

359
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:08,716
How could you make
a woman so miserable?

360
00:43:09,053 --> 00:43:11,817
What's wrong with wanting
to marry a man

361
00:43:11,956 --> 00:43:13,321
she loves and build a home?

362
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:15,118
This is delicious.

363
00:43:23,867 --> 00:43:26,631
Why don't you use this?
Knock yourself out.

364
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:37,406
l can't make the commitment.

365
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:39,106
No, actually l don't want to commit.

366
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:41,918
Why not?

367
00:43:43,153 --> 00:43:44,211
You scare me.

368
00:43:47,691 --> 00:43:48,658
Why?

369
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:02,534
You're too confident.

370
00:44:04,174 --> 00:44:07,940
Do you have any idea
how cruel life can be?

371
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:10,908
Say we get married...

372
00:44:14,551 --> 00:44:16,610
Can we be truly happy?

373
00:44:20,758 --> 00:44:22,419
Dad!

374
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:23,617
Why surprised?

375
00:44:23,761 --> 00:44:25,729
You invited us.

376
00:44:27,364 --> 00:44:28,524
You...

377
00:44:31,268 --> 00:44:33,327
You know each other?

378
00:44:48,652 --> 00:44:50,517
Honey, say something.

379
00:44:58,662 --> 00:44:59,924
Where are you going?

380
00:45:01,465 --> 00:45:03,524
To the ladies room.

381
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:13,342
l'm sorry.

382
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:15,912
Follow me to the
washroom downstairs.

383
00:45:37,468 --> 00:45:38,526
Your parents?

384
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:47,842
She hasn't told you?

385
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:55,618
Do you have a home?

386
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:02,919
lf you don't mind
l'll get going.

387
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:04,721
You're fired.

388
00:46:14,404 --> 00:46:17,373
Finish eating at least please.

389
00:46:17,574 --> 00:46:21,635
No, l mean... Wait until
Su-jin comes back.

390
00:46:24,548 --> 00:46:25,913
Sit!

391
00:46:31,054 --> 00:46:32,521
Excuse me.

392
00:46:34,758 --> 00:46:36,123
l'm very sorry about this

393
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:36,917
l will never...

394
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:39,119
Su-jin!

395
00:46:39,263 --> 00:46:43,222
Su-jin, wake up!

396
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:44,425
Su-jin!

397
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:46,429
Su-jin!

398
00:47:04,087 --> 00:47:07,352
She might have passed out
from intense stress.

399
00:47:07,558 --> 00:47:08,923
A little anemic too.

400
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:13,223
She'll be fine
after a good night sleep.

401
00:48:58,168 --> 00:49:02,036
Architect License

402
00:49:09,379 --> 00:49:10,676
Hot!

403
00:49:17,154 --> 00:49:19,520
What's wrong with me?

404
00:49:24,561 --> 00:49:26,222
Done bathing?

405
00:49:26,363 --> 00:49:27,330
Yeah.

406
00:49:28,265 --> 00:49:29,425
You sure?

407
00:49:30,267 --> 00:49:31,427
Of course.

408
00:49:39,676 --> 00:49:40,836
Positive?

409
00:49:45,449 --> 00:49:47,007
Did you wash your chest?

410
00:49:48,752 --> 00:49:49,810
l don't know.

411
00:49:51,054 --> 00:49:52,214
Your armpits?

412
00:49:53,857 --> 00:49:55,324
l think so.

413
00:50:00,964 --> 00:50:01,931
Your feet?

414
00:50:04,968 --> 00:50:07,129
No more questions!
Stop looking!

415
00:50:17,047 --> 00:50:21,746
This isn't good at all.

416
00:50:21,952 --> 00:50:24,318
You'll have to redo it.

417
00:50:24,454 --> 00:50:26,422
What's wrong with it?

418
00:50:26,556 --> 00:50:28,717
You know
we slaved over this!

419
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:31,020
Look at it from here.

420
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:33,026
Do it again.

421
00:50:33,163 --> 00:50:35,028
lt's not even aligned.

422
00:50:35,165 --> 00:50:36,928
Again?

423
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:39,433
Come on!
This is good enough.

424
00:50:39,569 --> 00:50:41,127
Nobody will notice!

425
00:50:41,671 --> 00:50:44,936
Take a look.
The reflection breaks, see?

426
00:50:45,075 --> 00:50:47,339
lt's the angle, man.

427
00:50:47,477 --> 00:50:49,638
And the spacing.

428
00:50:50,147 --> 00:50:52,411
lt's way off.

429
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:54,710
Do it again, okay?

430
00:50:55,152 --> 00:50:56,119
Okay.

431
00:50:56,253 --> 00:50:58,721
- Whose side are you!
- No, you're not redoing it!

432
00:50:58,855 --> 00:51:01,119
There you go again.

433
00:51:01,258 --> 00:51:04,716
Look who's talking
you little jerk!

434
00:51:04,861 --> 00:51:07,022
lt is fine as it is!

435
00:51:07,164 --> 00:51:10,725
Who do you think you are?
A damn artist?

436
00:51:10,867 --> 00:51:12,027
Hey, Choi!

437
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:15,704
Say hello to Mr. Hwang.

438
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:18,336
You've met him before.

439
00:51:18,475 --> 00:51:20,841
You're looking good.

440
00:51:22,379 --> 00:51:23,903
Congratulations on everything.

441
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:28,142
l've been asking your father-in-law
to arrange the meeting.

442
00:51:40,464 --> 00:51:42,830
What would look good here?

443
00:51:45,068 --> 00:51:46,228
Sorry?

444
00:51:49,372 --> 00:51:51,636
What should l build here?

445
00:51:56,213 --> 00:51:58,044
Rather than building something...

446
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:02,752
You may want to
leave it as it is.

447
00:52:03,487 --> 00:52:04,954
Leave it as it is...

448
00:52:10,093 --> 00:52:13,062
But if l insist.

449
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:20,659
lf you want a house.

450
00:52:26,109 --> 00:52:28,771
You should leave those trees.

451
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:34,840
Natural-grown ones are
different from the planted ones.

452
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:38,647
A house that...

453
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:41,352
is in balance.

454
00:52:43,193 --> 00:52:44,353
uh...

455
00:52:45,395 --> 00:52:46,555
inside and out.

456
00:52:52,302 --> 00:52:53,860
You see the pine tree over there?

457
00:52:55,305 --> 00:52:56,567
Great, isn't it?

458
00:52:58,508 --> 00:53:01,477
There is a reason for that.

459
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:04,746
Either it was under a rock
when young.

460
00:53:04,881 --> 00:53:07,645
Or shaded by a big tree nearby.

461
00:53:08,385 --> 00:53:11,752
ln short, it's been misplaced.

462
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:15,251
Like a pine tree on a cliff.

463
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:21,858
Hey, it's still dry.

464
00:53:21,998 --> 00:53:23,260
Don't touch it.

465
00:53:28,405 --> 00:53:30,669
Let's talk about the theme.

466
00:53:34,611 --> 00:53:35,873
Theme?

467
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:41,949
Where did your design come from?

468
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:50,353
Where it came from?

469
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:53,954
Well... l mean.

470
00:53:54,097 --> 00:53:56,657
What was your inspiration?

471
00:53:59,603 --> 00:54:01,366
My wife was the inspiration.

472
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:12,080
l had a chance to see her
all happy with her family.

473
00:54:14,784 --> 00:54:18,743
And that was very special to me.

474
00:54:19,889 --> 00:54:21,049
So...

475
00:54:23,026 --> 00:54:24,994
Walking along this hill.

476
00:54:27,631 --> 00:54:30,293
Looking around the empty lot.

477
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:37,305
l made up a story of them inside.

478
00:54:39,542 --> 00:54:42,602
And came up with its interior first.

479
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:01,791
This is Su-jin's
grandfather's hammer.

480
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:05,794
Chul-soo.

481
00:55:06,336 --> 00:55:08,804
You know Jesus, right?

482
00:55:13,343 --> 00:55:16,403
Did you know
he was a carpenter?

483
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:19,679
Carpenter is a holy vocation.

484
00:55:20,617 --> 00:55:21,777
Chul-soo.

485
00:55:23,019 --> 00:55:27,786
You know how a real carpenter is
different from a sham one?

486
00:55:29,426 --> 00:55:31,189
Go see at a shop.

487
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:34,092
There are so many sham ones.

488
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:40,599
They all complain about the wood.

489
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:44,106
The real carpenter.

490
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:48,708
Sees the texture.

491
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:50,073
What's the texture?

492
00:55:51,715 --> 00:55:53,273
lt's a possibility.

493
00:55:54,818 --> 00:55:57,378
The texture gets you anything.

494
00:55:59,322 --> 00:56:01,984
A real carpenter
can see that.

495
00:56:02,425 --> 00:56:04,188
lt's the same with people.

496
00:56:06,429 --> 00:56:09,193
You were all wrong.

497
00:56:10,133 --> 00:56:11,998
You still are.

498
00:56:12,135 --> 00:56:15,798
But l saw your texture.

499
00:56:17,741 --> 00:56:19,606
You know what l mean?

500
00:56:24,013 --> 00:56:25,480
You like it?

501
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:29,977
Rather than focusing
on the beautiful walls.

502
00:56:31,121 --> 00:56:35,581
l considered...

503
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:39,490
How people move under the roof.

504
00:56:44,334 --> 00:56:45,596
Keep going.

505
00:56:48,872 --> 00:56:50,134
What l mean is...

506
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:53,900
Geographic particulars demands

507
00:56:54,043 --> 00:56:57,979
that the drainage expansion
be considered.

508
00:57:16,966 --> 00:57:18,126
Ah...

509
00:57:29,746 --> 00:57:31,577
This is...

510
00:57:32,015 --> 00:57:35,883
The partial attachment between
the column and column door.

511
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:41,986
We're planning to handcraft
all the other decorations like this.

512
00:57:42,826 --> 00:57:49,664
lf l and my head carpenter
and you, the expert carpetners

513
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:55,294
are to focus on this project.

514
00:57:55,438 --> 00:57:59,101
l'm sure we will make it
to the date you want.

515
00:58:03,413 --> 00:58:04,573
Of course...

516
00:58:05,715 --> 00:58:08,377
You need to consider the budget.

517
00:58:09,219 --> 00:58:13,781
Handcraft will cost
you a bit more.

518
00:58:15,425 --> 00:58:17,086
You signed the contract?

519
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:20,888
We're waiting, Su-jin.

520
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:22,895
Later!

521
00:58:25,935 --> 00:58:28,995
Like this? Like Michael Jordan?

522
00:58:32,141 --> 00:58:33,506
No, no.

523
00:58:33,643 --> 00:58:35,611
That's too common.

524
00:58:36,246 --> 00:58:37,770
l think...

525
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:41,279
Well... wait.

526
00:58:41,918 --> 00:58:48,653
ln a restaurant when a server
with a tray trips and falls.

527
00:58:48,825 --> 00:58:52,192
He twists automatically
and spontaneously.

528
00:58:53,229 --> 00:58:56,687
Like you can support
in any situation.

529
00:58:56,833 --> 00:59:00,291
Like that...
Do you know what l'm saying?

530
00:59:58,728 --> 01:00:00,195
Not done yet?

531
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:02,798
l'm going to be late
for work.

532
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:08,802
Construction workers
love rainy days.

533
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:26,385
Why do you laugh so?

534
01:00:28,024 --> 01:00:30,288
lt's only a cup of tea.

535
01:00:45,174 --> 01:00:46,232
Kim Su-jin!

536
01:00:57,220 --> 01:00:59,586
Your mouth is hanging
off your ears, girl.

537
01:00:59,722 --> 01:01:01,383
Are you that happy being married?

538
01:01:01,524 --> 01:01:02,786
Doesn't the rain
make you melancholic?

539
01:01:02,925 --> 01:01:05,792
Put your bag down.
Nobody's taking it.

540
01:01:05,928 --> 01:01:08,396
No, give it here.

541
01:01:16,039 --> 01:01:19,907
Let me ask you something.

542
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:23,574
Have you ever gotten lost
on the familiar streets?

543
01:01:24,013 --> 01:01:26,675
We're not like you.

544
01:01:26,816 --> 01:01:29,080
Hey you get lost all the time, too.

545
01:01:29,218 --> 01:01:32,381
Even so, l never forget
the way to work.

546
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:36,185
How could you?
Unless you're going senile.

547
01:01:36,325 --> 01:01:39,692
Lately l've been having trouble...

548
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:45,599
finding my way home.

549
01:01:46,335 --> 01:01:47,495
lt's so strange.

550
01:01:54,343 --> 01:01:56,402
He must tire you out
every night!

551
01:03:01,644 --> 01:03:03,202
lt seems different.

552
01:03:04,413 --> 01:03:05,573
What does?

553
01:03:08,417 --> 01:03:09,679
The kitchen.

554
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:12,385
What about it?

555
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:15,988
lt's changed.

556
01:03:17,426 --> 01:03:18,791
Has it?

557
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:22,297
Hasn't it?

558
01:03:43,519 --> 01:03:45,487
No more burning pots.

559
01:03:48,224 --> 01:03:49,384
You like it?

560
01:03:59,735 --> 01:04:00,895
No.

561
01:04:01,737 --> 01:04:02,999
l love you!

562
01:04:34,437 --> 01:04:35,597
Go ahead.

563
01:04:49,619 --> 01:04:52,179
My head!

564
01:04:59,528 --> 01:05:00,688
What are you doing?

565
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:02,590
Sit down.

566
01:05:12,441 --> 01:05:16,309
Have you ever
blacked out recently?

567
01:05:16,445 --> 01:05:20,575
Due to unbearable stress...

568
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:24,683
Or an emotional breakdown?

569
01:05:27,623 --> 01:05:31,389
Once due to anemia.

570
01:05:31,527 --> 01:05:33,290
About stress...

571
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:37,488
ls it necessary to record this?

572
01:05:37,633 --> 01:05:41,399
Don't mind it.
lt might help later.

573
01:05:41,537 --> 01:05:44,597
Just answer my questions.

574
01:05:47,243 --> 01:05:49,905
l once loved a married man.

575
01:05:50,046 --> 01:05:54,574
But he didn't show up
at the train station.

576
01:05:55,418 --> 01:05:58,478
l was heartbroken
l felt like l was dying.

577
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:03,081
A few days earlier.

578
01:06:03,225 --> 01:06:06,490
l was attacked by his wife.

579
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:10,998
She pulled out
a bunch of my hair.

580
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:14,500
ln the cases physically dealing
with emotional stress...

581
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:17,504
everybody reacts differently.

582
01:06:18,841 --> 01:06:23,005
Your current symptoms might have
come from severe stress.

583
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:28,181
Come back next week.
We will run an MRl and CT scan on you.

584
01:06:34,857 --> 01:06:36,916
Hey, take these.

585
01:06:38,427 --> 01:06:40,486
Nice office!

586
01:06:42,131 --> 01:06:44,099
You made it, Foreman.

587
01:06:44,233 --> 01:06:45,393
Not a foreman anymore!

588
01:06:45,534 --> 01:06:48,298
l'm the foreman now.

589
01:06:48,437 --> 01:06:51,895
Where's my desk?
ln the back?

590
01:06:52,041 --> 01:06:53,008
lt's not fun.
Let's get out of here.

591
01:06:53,142 --> 01:06:54,803
He's not done yet.

592
01:06:54,944 --> 01:06:56,707
You see this? Everybody changes.

593
01:06:56,812 --> 01:06:59,178
You can't trust anybody.

594
01:06:59,315 --> 01:07:01,875
Let's go, He's changed.
l don't need this crap

595
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:02,677
Come on!

596
01:07:02,818 --> 01:07:04,479
Chul-soo, make me
a business card, will you?

597
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:07,885
- You don't need no business card!
- l'll pick'em up tomorrow!

598
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:09,184
Let's go!

599
01:07:09,725 --> 01:07:10,714
Get back here!

600
01:07:10,826 --> 01:07:13,386
- Give me your business card.
- l'll get you one.

601
01:07:20,736 --> 01:07:22,704
Wow, she's so pretty.

602
01:07:22,838 --> 01:07:26,103
These young girls are
experts on makeups.

603
01:07:26,242 --> 01:07:27,937
But no good at cooking.

604
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:29,939
Just like me.

605
01:07:30,346 --> 01:07:32,814
You became more sophisticated.

606
01:07:34,016 --> 01:07:36,075
You used to take it away.

607
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:38,482
Now you're asking for a loan.

608
01:07:40,222 --> 01:07:42,281
Perfect timing, too.

609
01:07:43,125 --> 01:07:45,593
Showed up just when
l got out of the bottom.

610
01:07:47,129 --> 01:07:49,188
Do l owe you anything?

611
01:07:51,634 --> 01:07:54,694
You don't know how
l pray for your success.

612
01:07:55,538 --> 01:07:59,907
Don't be stingy about
a few dollars.

613
01:08:00,042 --> 01:08:01,805
That's so cheap.

614
01:08:04,713 --> 01:08:06,476
Did you say cheap?

615
01:08:09,819 --> 01:08:11,980
You look so much better.

616
01:08:12,421 --> 01:08:13,888
Oh, my boy.

617
01:08:15,024 --> 01:08:17,288
Your wife takes good
care of you, right?

618
01:08:19,628 --> 01:08:22,893
So, what is it?

619
01:08:23,232 --> 01:08:24,995
Will you do it for me?

620
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:27,698
You have your men.

621
01:08:27,837 --> 01:08:29,498
Ask your giglos.

622
01:08:29,638 --> 01:08:31,299
What? Giglos?

623
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:34,004
Hey, watch what you
say to your mom.

624
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:37,276
You're worse than before now.

625
01:08:38,314 --> 01:08:42,774
You think l got that money
all for myself?

626
01:08:43,519 --> 01:08:44,781
Didn't you?

627
01:08:47,223 --> 01:08:50,283
You know you shouldn't
borrow money from gangs.

628
01:08:50,426 --> 01:08:52,189
You'll go to jail.

629
01:08:52,328 --> 01:08:53,488
Jail?

630
01:08:54,730 --> 01:08:56,391
How can you say that?

631
01:08:56,532 --> 01:08:57,897
Okay, okay.

632
01:09:00,736 --> 01:09:02,499
l'm leaving.

633
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:04,902
l'll list you as my
insurance beneficiary.

634
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:08,498
So take that with your
pretty wife, you asshole.

635
01:09:09,044 --> 01:09:11,171
We just met in three years
and that's all you say?

636
01:09:14,016 --> 01:09:15,779
Can't you loan me a half of it?

637
01:09:16,018 --> 01:09:17,576
l'll take care of the rest.

638
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:20,581
7% interest is perfect
you know.

639
01:09:24,026 --> 01:09:25,687
Okay, fine.

640
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:30,694
l'll never come
to see you again.

641
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:31,993
Asshole.

642
01:09:32,134 --> 01:09:36,002
lf you hear about
a corpse in a river.

643
01:09:36,138 --> 01:09:38,504
You know it's me.

644
01:09:38,641 --> 01:09:40,006
You, jerk.

645
01:09:40,142 --> 01:09:43,976
l don't expect you to
bury my body either.

646
01:09:44,113 --> 01:09:47,879
Bastard...
You're such a mean son.

647
01:10:40,035 --> 01:10:41,696
Which way is south?

648
01:10:41,837 --> 01:10:43,202
That way.

649
01:10:43,339 --> 01:10:46,001
So the front door will be here.

650
01:10:46,141 --> 01:10:48,905
All the electronics go here.

651
01:10:49,044 --> 01:10:52,775
And here's the bathroom.

652
01:10:52,915 --> 01:10:54,576
- A big one This big!
- What about our room?

653
01:10:54,717 --> 01:10:55,979
Our room?

654
01:10:56,118 --> 01:10:57,676
Where do you want it?

655
01:10:59,521 --> 01:11:00,283
There?

656
01:11:00,422 --> 01:11:03,186
There it is!

657
01:11:03,325 --> 01:11:04,883
A great choice!

658
01:11:05,027 --> 01:11:09,088
We'll wake up
with sunshine on our faces...

659
01:11:09,231 --> 01:11:13,292
eat breakfast over here
and watch TV there.

660
01:11:19,842 --> 01:11:21,207
Wait just a little.

661
01:11:21,644 --> 01:11:24,078
l've been eyeing this lot
for 3 years now.

662
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:07,580
Nothing but horribIe memories...

663
01:12:08,724 --> 01:12:12,182
He beat me for no reason
and treated me Iike a sIave.

664
01:12:12,294 --> 01:12:14,159
Giving me nothing
but food and a pIace to sIeep.

665
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:15,797
Just one mean oId fart!

666
01:12:17,433 --> 01:12:21,199
When I was 9, he put a hammer
in my hand for the first time.

667
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:23,635
It was so heavy...

668
01:12:23,806 --> 01:12:28,505
If it weren't for him,
I wouId never have become a carpenter.

669
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:30,406
I hated him.

670
01:12:34,717 --> 01:12:37,686
Still building this temple?
lt's been over 10 years.

671
01:12:42,725 --> 01:12:44,192
What do you want?

672
01:12:48,831 --> 01:12:50,799
My wife wants to see you.

673
01:13:07,883 --> 01:13:12,980
What's the point of coming
after the wedding?

674
01:13:13,122 --> 01:13:16,990
Do you wipe your ass
before you shit?

675
01:13:17,126 --> 01:13:18,593
Bastard!

676
01:13:23,732 --> 01:13:26,496
You carved it too deep!

677
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:33,800
What have you done?

678
01:13:33,942 --> 01:13:36,775
The angle is way off!

679
01:13:41,316 --> 01:13:42,783
Let me go get
some mountain water.

680
01:13:50,225 --> 01:13:51,886
Here.

681
01:13:54,229 --> 01:13:57,198
You have pretty hands.

682
01:13:57,733 --> 01:14:01,191
Have you met his mother?

683
01:14:02,137 --> 01:14:03,104
What?

684
01:14:03,238 --> 01:14:06,298
Your mother-in-law!

685
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:07,704
No.

686
01:14:08,644 --> 01:14:11,477
He hasn't let you?

687
01:14:13,215 --> 01:14:14,375
No.

688
01:14:14,516 --> 01:14:19,579
That little bastard is still
mad at her?

689
01:14:19,721 --> 01:14:25,387
lt's about time he forgave her.
lt was so long ago.

690
01:15:36,532 --> 01:15:40,298
Demurrer to Seizure

691
01:16:35,557 --> 01:16:37,115
l don't have a mother.

692
01:16:39,061 --> 01:16:40,824
She's still your mother.

693
01:16:42,264 --> 01:16:43,731
l don't have one.

694
01:16:45,767 --> 01:16:47,826
She's your mother.

695
01:16:51,073 --> 01:16:53,234
Do you know how hard
l've worked for that money?

696
01:16:54,676 --> 01:16:59,010
Why should l give it
to someone l hardly know?

697
01:16:59,648 --> 01:17:01,809
No way in hell!
Let's stop it.

698
01:17:03,952 --> 01:17:05,817
She's your family.

699
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:09,515
Family?

700
01:17:11,259 --> 01:17:14,717
l have my family right here
and this is my home.

701
01:17:14,863 --> 01:17:16,524
And you're my family!

702
01:17:20,869 --> 01:17:22,029
Okay?

703
01:17:23,772 --> 01:17:25,535
l'm building our new house
with that money.

704
01:17:25,674 --> 01:17:29,132
lf we move into
that new house...

705
01:17:29,277 --> 01:17:30,505
You think we'll be happy?

706
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:31,704
Damn!

707
01:17:34,850 --> 01:17:35,908
Drop it.

708
01:17:38,453 --> 01:17:40,318
Why is it so hard
to forgive her?

709
01:17:41,957 --> 01:17:43,822
- Forgiveness is...
- Stop it!

710
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:46,218
What are parents?

711
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:48,758
The one's that give you life?

712
01:17:51,133 --> 01:17:54,694
And then their job is over?

713
01:17:56,138 --> 01:17:57,503
What do you know about her?

714
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:01,209
Who do you think you are
trying to help her?

715
01:18:02,544 --> 01:18:03,977
Cut it out.

716
01:18:04,112 --> 01:18:05,272
Stop crying.

717
01:18:08,417 --> 01:18:11,978
You know why l never cry?
l ran out of tears that night.

718
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:13,883
When she left me, dumped me
over to this old man,

719
01:18:14,022 --> 01:18:16,183
l cried all night long!

720
01:18:19,928 --> 01:18:22,590
l will never cry again
for that woman...

721
01:18:22,731 --> 01:18:24,699
nor give her a penny.

722
01:18:41,216 --> 01:18:42,979
Forgiving...

723
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:46,385
isn't that hard.

724
01:18:47,723 --> 01:18:48,985
lt's just...

725
01:18:50,525 --> 01:18:53,585
giving away just one plain room
in your heart.

726
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:55,788
My grandpa said so.

727
01:18:56,965 --> 01:18:58,432
A true carpenter...

728
01:19:00,102 --> 01:19:02,570
is the one that can build
a house in his heart.

729
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:09,806
But in the house you've built.
So we'll in your heart...

730
01:19:10,512 --> 01:19:14,778
You gave all the rooms away
to your mother and to your hate.

731
01:19:17,719 --> 01:19:21,280
And where are you? And you're
shivering outside the house.

732
01:19:26,628 --> 01:19:27,788
l understand.

733
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:31,194
l know it's hard to forgive.

734
01:19:32,234 --> 01:19:33,496
But...

735
01:19:36,138 --> 01:19:38,971
My dad remembered
that piece of wisdom...

736
01:19:40,041 --> 01:19:45,570
and forgave me when l almost
ran off with a married man...

737
01:19:45,714 --> 01:19:49,980
and he permitted our marriage
so easily.

738
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:51,881
You know why?

739
01:19:53,021 --> 01:19:56,787
Forgiving... is giving your hate
just a little room in your heart.

740
01:20:09,738 --> 01:20:10,898
Forget it.

741
01:20:12,841 --> 01:20:14,604
Who asked for your help?

742
01:20:16,344 --> 01:20:19,973
Came to see if l'm dead?

743
01:20:21,316 --> 01:20:23,978
You're no different
from you dad.

744
01:20:24,753 --> 01:20:26,448
You bastard!

745
01:20:26,555 --> 01:20:29,115
You're one merciless
malicious son of a bitch!

746
01:20:29,257 --> 01:20:34,957
l wasn't myself when l had you
when l was seventeen.

747
01:20:35,063 --> 01:20:37,463
l should've had an abortion.
Erase you out of my misery!

748
01:20:37,566 --> 01:20:39,033
What was l thinking!

749
01:20:43,138 --> 01:20:47,700
Let's see how good you do
without a mother!

750
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:51,278
Get the hell out of here.

751
01:20:51,713 --> 01:20:53,772
l don't need you.

752
01:20:53,915 --> 01:20:56,975
Go!

753
01:20:57,118 --> 01:21:00,576
Get out of here, Go!

754
01:21:05,026 --> 01:21:06,288
56 thousand dollars.

755
01:21:07,128 --> 01:21:09,289
Damn, new shit...

756
01:21:12,133 --> 01:21:13,191
How much in total?

757
01:21:14,236 --> 01:21:15,897
Overdue interest...

758
01:21:17,138 --> 01:21:20,107
On top of that...

759
01:21:22,744 --> 01:21:25,577
lt's over 90 grand.

760
01:21:25,714 --> 01:21:28,376
lt's a lot of money.

761
01:21:29,017 --> 01:21:31,485
Don't you think?

762
01:21:38,627 --> 01:21:40,094
We're broke now.

763
01:21:43,031 --> 01:21:44,191
Fine.

764
01:21:46,735 --> 01:21:47,997
l'll pay.

765
01:21:50,538 --> 01:21:52,403
Didn't l tell you l would?

766
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:54,599
Check please!

767
01:22:06,521 --> 01:22:08,785
Place your bets.

768
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:11,484
Even a dog at a glance
can win.

769
01:22:11,626 --> 01:22:13,287
Chul-soo wins cigarette money
Su-jin wins bread money.

770
01:22:13,428 --> 01:22:14,690
Don't let your luck slip by...
The luck is right in your hands.

771
01:22:14,829 --> 01:22:17,093
Pick an Ace!
An Ace!

772
01:22:38,086 --> 01:22:40,054
What's the date today?

773
01:22:41,756 --> 01:22:43,223
Do you know?

774
01:22:46,428 --> 01:22:49,693
l always lose track
of the date.

775
01:22:49,831 --> 01:22:54,996
l told you to come back
in a week, not two.

776
01:22:55,837 --> 01:22:57,498
Any siblings?

777
01:22:58,940 --> 01:23:01,306
One sister.

778
01:23:01,443 --> 01:23:02,410
Okay.

779
01:23:04,412 --> 01:23:07,973
How old is she?

780
01:23:08,116 --> 01:23:09,174
Twenty.

781
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:13,586
No... Nineteen maybe?

782
01:23:15,724 --> 01:23:17,885
l'm bad with numbers.

783
01:23:19,327 --> 01:23:22,387
Give me her birthday.

784
01:23:31,439 --> 01:23:35,398
What color is the light
for the walk signal?

785
01:23:36,544 --> 01:23:38,978
What kind of questions
are these?

786
01:23:39,114 --> 01:23:43,881
Just answer the question.

787
01:23:47,922 --> 01:23:50,482
What was the question?

788
01:23:50,625 --> 01:23:53,389
What do you call
your mother's sister?

789
01:23:53,528 --> 01:23:55,894
What's 18 plus 19?

790
01:23:56,031 --> 01:23:59,398
lf l fly a balloon
when the wind moving westward...

791
01:23:59,534 --> 01:24:01,593
which way will it go?

792
01:24:07,842 --> 01:24:11,778
l don't know if this is
good news or bad news.

793
01:24:11,913 --> 01:24:13,676
l just found out myself.

794
01:24:13,915 --> 01:24:14,973
Pardon me?

795
01:24:15,450 --> 01:24:16,974
l'm telling you the truth.

796
01:24:20,121 --> 01:24:21,383
For real?

797
01:24:21,523 --> 01:24:22,785
l don't believe you.

798
01:24:41,242 --> 01:24:42,607
Close the door, will you?

799
01:24:53,054 --> 01:24:54,316
Sit.

800
01:24:54,456 --> 01:24:55,718
l'll stand.

801
01:24:59,828 --> 01:25:01,796
l'm back for good.

802
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:04,899
They closed the branch in Paris.

803
01:25:05,433 --> 01:25:06,491
l've heard.

804
01:25:09,637 --> 01:25:11,400
We'll be working together.

805
01:25:13,842 --> 01:25:15,605
The table has turned though.

806
01:25:15,743 --> 01:25:18,473
Now l'm single
and you're married.

807
01:25:21,816 --> 01:25:24,080
ls fate playing with us?

808
01:25:27,422 --> 01:25:30,482
Look... l couldn't make it that day
because l was...

809
01:25:30,625 --> 01:25:32,388
l don't remember anything.

810
01:25:32,527 --> 01:25:34,290
See you at the clothing lab.

811
01:25:35,230 --> 01:25:42,796
Now we're in the same boat.

812
01:25:42,937 --> 01:25:44,495
lt's only a beginning.

813
01:25:45,039 --> 01:25:47,007
Let's make this work.

814
01:25:47,142 --> 01:25:50,009
A busy worker ant doesn't
have time to be sad, right?

815
01:25:50,111 --> 01:25:50,873
That's the spirit!

816
01:25:51,012 --> 01:25:52,775
- Good job, guys.
- Congratulations.

817
01:25:57,018 --> 01:25:57,985
Don't lose it.

818
01:26:01,823 --> 01:26:03,188
ls this important?

819
01:26:54,475 --> 01:26:55,635
Where were you?

820
01:27:00,248 --> 01:27:02,808
You glued it?

821
01:27:02,951 --> 01:27:04,111
No.

822
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:10,152
What did the doctor say?

823
01:27:11,292 --> 01:27:13,351
Told me to come back
next week.

824
01:27:14,996 --> 01:27:16,054
Again?

825
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:21,764
How long will it take
to fill this out?

826
01:27:25,206 --> 01:27:28,573
Say something, Doctor.

827
01:27:31,879 --> 01:27:36,543
Analyzing the MRl
and PET scan...

828
01:27:36,684 --> 01:27:39,653
and all the test results...

829
01:27:41,689 --> 01:27:44,556
Abnormal proteins

830
01:27:44,692 --> 01:27:48,059
have clogged up
the veins in your brain...

831
01:27:49,397 --> 01:27:51,160
affecting the brain cells.

832
01:27:51,299 --> 01:27:55,861
l don't understand
a word you're saying.

833
01:27:56,004 --> 01:27:58,564
Speak English please.

834
01:27:58,706 --> 01:28:02,472
l'm certain the cause
is largely genetic.

835
01:28:02,610 --> 01:28:05,545
A very rare case.

836
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:07,739
You have...

837
01:28:11,786 --> 01:28:14,949
Alzheimer's disease.

838
01:28:16,391 --> 01:28:17,551
What?

839
01:28:18,192 --> 01:28:21,559
Alz... what?

840
01:28:21,696 --> 01:28:23,061
Alzheimer.

841
01:28:23,598 --> 01:28:26,863
Alzheimer?
What's that?

842
01:28:29,504 --> 01:28:34,066
The questions l asked were
to diagnose dementia.

843
01:28:35,209 --> 01:28:39,441
But l'm only 27.

844
01:28:40,982 --> 01:28:43,143
How could l be going senile?

845
01:28:43,284 --> 01:28:44,751
lt's possible.

846
01:28:46,087 --> 01:28:47,247
So...

847
01:28:48,690 --> 01:28:50,453
What's going to
happen to me?

848
01:28:52,193 --> 01:28:56,653
A mental death will come
before a physical one.

849
01:28:57,699 --> 01:29:00,463
Better prepare yourself
for what's inevitable.

850
01:29:01,602 --> 01:29:05,368
Medicine can slow it down.

851
01:29:06,908 --> 01:29:08,273
But that's about it.

852
01:29:09,010 --> 01:29:12,446
What about surgery?

853
01:29:17,485 --> 01:29:19,248
Do you work?

854
01:29:19,387 --> 01:29:20,354
Yes.

855
01:29:22,290 --> 01:29:23,848
You should quit right away.

856
01:29:24,892 --> 01:29:28,555
Soon you won't be able to
type or answer the phone...

857
01:29:28,696 --> 01:29:30,755
let alone organize things.

858
01:29:30,898 --> 01:29:33,560
Pretty much nothing.

859
01:29:33,701 --> 01:29:37,967
You will forget your family,
friends and even yourself.

860
01:29:38,706 --> 01:29:42,665
All your memories will
disappear completely.

861
01:30:53,181 --> 01:30:54,944
Should l quit my job?

862
01:30:56,384 --> 01:30:57,544
Why?

863
01:30:59,687 --> 01:31:05,057
Why don't l stay home
and do the chores?

864
01:31:06,894 --> 01:31:10,057
Sure, l'd like that.

865
01:31:11,299 --> 01:31:12,857
Why suddenly?

866
01:31:14,502 --> 01:31:16,265
l don't know.

867
01:31:18,206 --> 01:31:20,868
Tired of working?

868
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:25,746
lt's dog-eat-dog out there
l'll bring home the bread and milk.

869
01:31:26,881 --> 01:31:28,143
Quit right away.

870
01:31:31,285 --> 01:31:33,344
Maybe l'll quit tomorrow?

871
01:31:36,991 --> 01:31:38,253
Hold on.

872
01:31:39,093 --> 01:31:40,458
What's going on?

873
01:31:47,101 --> 01:31:49,160
Do you want a baby?

874
01:31:54,108 --> 01:31:55,268
A baby?

875
01:31:57,578 --> 01:31:58,943
l don't know.

876
01:32:00,781 --> 01:32:03,147
Never thought about it.

877
01:32:11,192 --> 01:32:12,454
Do it for me.

878
01:32:13,995 --> 01:32:15,155
What?

879
01:32:15,897 --> 01:32:17,057
That.

880
01:32:17,965 --> 01:32:19,125
What?

881
01:32:20,902 --> 01:32:24,360
That...

882
01:32:26,507 --> 01:32:28,771
You mean... in-and-out?

883
01:32:29,410 --> 01:32:34,245
No, that thing you do
with cards.

884
01:32:34,382 --> 01:32:35,542
Grift?

885
01:32:37,184 --> 01:32:38,742
You never win.

886
01:32:38,886 --> 01:32:40,046
Just once.

887
01:32:42,790 --> 01:32:45,156
No, l'm tired.

888
01:32:45,293 --> 01:32:47,158
Please just once.

889
01:33:02,610 --> 01:33:03,941
You're not saying it?

890
01:33:07,481 --> 01:33:09,449
Place your bets.

891
01:33:09,584 --> 01:33:12,144
Even a dog at a glance can win.

892
01:33:12,286 --> 01:33:14,345
Su-jin wins bread money.
Chul-soo wins cigarette money.

893
01:33:14,488 --> 01:33:15,189
Double up your money.

894
01:33:15,189 --> 01:33:16,816
Don't let your luck slip by...

895
01:33:16,991 --> 01:33:18,652
The luck is right
in your hands.

896
01:33:18,793 --> 01:33:20,158
Pick an Ace!

897
01:33:21,195 --> 01:33:22,355
An Ace!

898
01:33:23,698 --> 01:33:25,666
You win.

899
01:35:14,642 --> 01:35:16,507
Won't you be bored?

900
01:35:17,278 --> 01:35:18,438
No.

901
01:36:26,380 --> 01:36:27,472
Hello?

902
01:36:27,748 --> 01:36:29,010
Young-min here.

903
01:36:30,050 --> 01:36:31,813
How could you quit
without notice?

904
01:36:33,521 --> 01:36:35,921
lf it's me
let's meet and talk.

905
01:36:36,123 --> 01:36:37,283
No.

906
01:36:37,758 --> 01:36:39,419
l'm not hitting on you!

907
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:41,289
- l just...
- You want to quit, then follow the rule!

908
01:36:41,462 --> 01:36:43,987
- l just want to stay home.
- What's wrong with you!

909
01:36:44,131 --> 01:36:46,725
lf you don't feel comfortable with me
we can meet with other colleagues.

910
01:36:47,568 --> 01:36:49,229
l'll come to the office.

911
01:36:52,573 --> 01:36:54,302
- Here you go.
- Give me one of those

912
01:36:54,408 --> 01:36:56,569
You packed a lunch?

913
01:37:00,281 --> 01:37:02,841
How nice!

914
01:37:03,284 --> 01:37:05,252
The color is so tacky!

915
01:37:05,786 --> 01:37:08,152
Let's see what you have.

916
01:37:09,490 --> 01:37:11,856
Rice!

917
01:37:12,359 --> 01:37:14,327
Looks so good!

918
01:37:21,569 --> 01:37:23,127
What about side dishes?

919
01:37:23,237 --> 01:37:24,898
ls that for me?
You shouldn't have!

920
01:38:19,159 --> 01:38:20,319
Maybe...

921
01:38:24,965 --> 01:38:28,731
you've confused her with someone
else with the same name?

922
01:38:29,169 --> 01:38:30,329
Or the wrong documents...

923
01:38:30,471 --> 01:38:32,234
Hands off!
You won't understand it anyway!

924
01:38:32,373 --> 01:38:34,204
lt's your wife.

925
01:38:43,050 --> 01:38:44,415
Are you crazy?

926
01:38:48,956 --> 01:38:50,218
You okay, Ma'am?

927
01:38:52,660 --> 01:38:54,628
Why the hell did you
tell her everything?

928
01:38:55,162 --> 01:38:56,322
Why the hell did you
tell her everything?

929
01:38:56,463 --> 01:38:57,623
l am a doctor.

930
01:38:58,265 --> 01:39:01,826
She needs time to prepare
for what's coming.

931
01:39:04,872 --> 01:39:09,104
- You sure about this?
- Of course!

932
01:39:11,745 --> 01:39:13,007
Positive?

933
01:39:13,347 --> 01:39:16,612
lf you don't believe me,
take her to another doctor.

934
01:39:16,750 --> 01:39:17,910
Doctor!

935
01:39:18,152 --> 01:39:19,312
Are you sure!

936
01:39:19,453 --> 01:39:21,011
You crazy?
What's wrong with you?

937
01:39:21,155 --> 01:39:23,316
- Are you sure?
- This is a hospital!

938
01:39:23,457 --> 01:39:24,617
Are you sure?

939
01:39:24,758 --> 01:39:26,225
Calm down, sir!

940
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:29,727
His wife died from it, too.

941
01:39:31,031 --> 01:39:34,159
He's spent half of his life
researching Alzheimer's.

942
01:39:35,502 --> 01:39:38,665
Accept what's real.
You can't change it

943
01:39:42,776 --> 01:39:44,243
Are you alright?

944
01:39:44,611 --> 01:39:46,442
Do you need to see a doctor?

945
01:39:49,350 --> 01:39:52,513
Just little bit more...

946
01:39:53,153 --> 01:39:54,711
Where are you going?

947
01:39:57,257 --> 01:40:00,124
- l have no idea.
- Excuse me?

948
01:40:03,063 --> 01:40:04,428
l don't believe it.

949
01:40:08,669 --> 01:40:10,728
They are cloning
human-beings nowadays.

950
01:40:12,373 --> 01:40:14,500
There must be a cure for this.

951
01:40:14,641 --> 01:40:16,006
l understand.

952
01:40:17,845 --> 01:40:21,713
But your wife is a rare case.

953
01:40:21,849 --> 01:40:24,511
Her symptoms are
very close to my wife's.

954
01:40:26,453 --> 01:40:28,011
lt's an old story...

955
01:40:29,456 --> 01:40:31,219
Before my wife died...

956
01:40:31,358 --> 01:40:34,225
l took her to the place
we first met.

957
01:40:38,165 --> 01:40:42,431
lncredibly, she remembered
almost everything then.

958
01:40:42,970 --> 01:40:47,304
l was just so happy
that l couldn't hold back my tears.

959
01:40:47,441 --> 01:40:50,706
l thought things were
coming back to her.

960
01:40:50,844 --> 01:40:53,404
l was so happy.

961
01:40:55,249 --> 01:40:57,615
And about 3 hours later.

962
01:40:58,152 --> 01:40:59,414
She looked at me and said...

963
01:41:00,154 --> 01:41:01,815
Who are you?

964
01:41:01,955 --> 01:41:05,721
Why are you crying so?
That's what she said.

965
01:41:07,261 --> 01:41:14,429
Hah, that's a mystery of
human brains, isn't it?

966
01:41:16,870 --> 01:41:20,601
l'm telling you this
from my own experience.

967
01:41:20,741 --> 01:41:22,106
You can't find it in books.

968
01:41:29,983 --> 01:41:32,281
- Hello?
- Who's this?

969
01:41:32,352 --> 01:41:35,412
l found this cell phone
on the street.

970
01:41:58,946 --> 01:42:00,208
What happened?

971
01:42:02,649 --> 01:42:03,809
What happened to her?

972
01:42:05,152 --> 01:42:06,414
That's...

973
01:42:06,887 --> 01:42:09,651
How can l explain this?

974
01:42:11,158 --> 01:42:12,625
Young-min.

975
01:42:34,948 --> 01:42:39,112
Can we go back to...
two years ago?

976
01:42:42,156 --> 01:42:43,316
Two years ago?

977
01:42:44,658 --> 01:42:47,718
What for?
That's even before we met.

978
01:42:49,163 --> 01:42:50,323
What?

979
01:43:01,742 --> 01:43:03,607
What are you thinking about?

980
01:43:09,349 --> 01:43:10,611
Su-jin!

981
01:43:35,542 --> 01:43:36,702
Fool.

982
01:43:37,644 --> 01:43:39,305
Keep your eye on the ball.

983
01:43:43,150 --> 01:43:44,515
lt's strange.

984
01:43:45,152 --> 01:43:48,713
l only got 9 balls.
lt's actually 10, right?

985
01:43:48,989 --> 01:43:50,854
lsn't it?

986
01:43:56,363 --> 01:43:57,830
Did you find out?

987
01:43:59,766 --> 01:44:01,028
What?

988
01:44:07,341 --> 01:44:11,402
That l have an eraser in my head.

989
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:18,912
- Let's part ways.
- What?

990
01:44:20,754 --> 01:44:22,415
You were right.

991
01:44:23,457 --> 01:44:25,516
One can't be happy forever.

992
01:44:27,160 --> 01:44:29,822
- What are you talking about?
- lt's all over.

993
01:44:30,664 --> 01:44:32,325
Think about it.

994
01:44:32,466 --> 01:44:36,562
What's love good for
if my memory is gone?

995
01:44:38,272 --> 01:44:39,899
Don't be so nice to me.

996
01:44:40,040 --> 01:44:41,598
l'll forget everything.

997
01:44:42,242 --> 01:44:44,301
l'll remember everything
for you.

998
01:44:45,846 --> 01:44:47,507
You know l'm smart.

999
01:44:47,648 --> 01:44:49,513
l passed the architect test
on the first try.

1000
01:44:52,252 --> 01:44:54,413
You're too confident.

1001
01:44:54,554 --> 01:44:56,715
Life can be very cruel.

1002
01:45:01,361 --> 01:45:03,329
You didn't forget that.

1003
01:45:05,165 --> 01:45:07,326
How could l?

1004
01:45:07,467 --> 01:45:08,627
You're mean.

1005
01:45:12,272 --> 01:45:13,603
Don't worry.

1006
01:45:15,842 --> 01:45:17,605
There'll be a cure...

1007
01:45:20,747 --> 01:45:24,843
You crybaby! Have you lost
your parents or your country?

1008
01:45:26,053 --> 01:45:27,714
l'll just leave.

1009
01:45:27,854 --> 01:45:29,321
Please let me go, okay?

1010
01:45:29,456 --> 01:45:30,718
Want to have a go?

1011
01:45:31,058 --> 01:45:32,320
Want to bet on it?

1012
01:45:39,433 --> 01:45:40,593
Damn!

1013
01:45:42,069 --> 01:45:43,331
Why are you crying?

1014
01:45:46,173 --> 01:45:47,902
l said l'd remember
everything for you!

1015
01:45:48,942 --> 01:45:51,001
You know what?

1016
01:45:52,946 --> 01:45:57,508
lf you forget everything
l will pop up out of nowhere.

1017
01:45:59,052 --> 01:46:00,212
Like this.

1018
01:46:01,455 --> 01:46:03,013
And l'll hit on you.

1019
01:46:03,156 --> 01:46:04,817
You won't be able to
turn me down.

1020
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:08,323
We'll start afresh every day.

1021
01:46:10,664 --> 01:46:12,928
Like permanent dating.
Awesome, isn't it?

1022
01:46:14,768 --> 01:46:18,135
You're going to grow
a goatee again?

1023
01:46:18,872 --> 01:46:20,806
Don't bother.

1024
01:46:20,941 --> 01:46:23,603
Let's forget everything
while we're happy.

1025
01:46:29,349 --> 01:46:31,408
l'll forget everything soon.

1026
01:46:32,552 --> 01:46:35,419
l won't know
why you're with me.

1027
01:46:36,356 --> 01:46:38,722
You'll be gone out of my head.

1028
01:46:38,859 --> 01:46:40,326
And so will l.

1029
01:46:40,460 --> 01:46:42,018
You understand that?

1030
01:46:42,863 --> 01:46:47,425
As my memory disappears
my soul will disappear too.

1031
01:46:48,568 --> 01:46:50,035
l'm scared!

1032
01:47:01,948 --> 01:47:03,506
Why would your soul disappear?

1033
01:47:04,651 --> 01:47:05,811
Get up.

1034
01:47:09,055 --> 01:47:11,114
Leave it to me.

1035
01:47:13,460 --> 01:47:17,328
l'm your memory.
l'm your heart.

1036
01:47:17,564 --> 01:47:18,724
Got that?

1037
01:47:21,568 --> 01:47:22,728
No more tears!

1038
01:48:20,160 --> 01:48:23,823

Kim Su-jin.

Come home early.

1051
01:49:19,853 --> 01:49:21,115
Okay.

1052

By six.

1053
01:49:23,557 --> 01:49:24,717
Okay.

1054
01:49:25,058 --> 01:49:26,616
What for?

1055
01:49:26,760 --> 01:49:27,920
Do you want to go somewhere?

1056
01:49:28,061 --> 01:49:32,122
lt's your moms birthday
Forgot again?

1057
01:49:33,166 --> 01:49:34,326
Take these.

1058
01:49:35,869 --> 01:49:40,101
l've also invited my parents
and your carpenter teacher.

1059
01:49:40,240 --> 01:49:43,505
l'll cook lots of food.
Don't be late.

1060
01:50:16,042 --> 01:50:17,202
Honey?

1061
01:50:24,751 --> 01:50:25,911
lt's yours.

1062
01:50:29,356 --> 01:50:30,516
See if...

1063
01:50:32,959 --> 01:50:34,722
Did you eat yet?

1064
01:50:37,364 --> 01:50:38,524
Hold on.

1065
01:50:39,165 --> 01:50:40,928
Having a party
today or something?

1066
01:50:41,468 --> 01:50:44,335
What party?

1067
01:50:44,471 --> 01:50:45,631
Never mind.

1068
01:50:46,272 --> 01:50:48,399
Can we go somewhere
and talk?

1069
01:50:49,743 --> 01:50:51,506
Why bother?

1070
01:50:51,645 --> 01:50:53,613
Go wash up.
We're eating soon.

1071
01:50:55,849 --> 01:50:58,317
Remember what happened
the other day on the street?

1072
01:51:01,855 --> 01:51:03,015
What?

1073
01:51:04,257 --> 01:51:05,417
l'm married?

1074
01:51:05,558 --> 01:51:07,617
What are you saying?
You're not?

1075
01:51:09,663 --> 01:51:11,324
What's wrong, Young-min?

1076
01:51:12,165 --> 01:51:14,725
Are you trying to dump me?

1077
01:51:14,868 --> 01:51:16,426
Please don't!

1078
01:51:16,970 --> 01:51:19,530
What are you talking about?

1079
01:51:19,673 --> 01:51:20,697
Come to your senses.

1080
01:51:20,840 --> 01:51:22,603
Wake up!

1081
01:51:22,742 --> 01:51:25,210
Su-jin, are you okay?

1082
01:51:33,553 --> 01:51:35,020
Who's that guy?

1083
01:51:43,663 --> 01:51:45,631
l just...

1084
01:51:52,739 --> 01:51:54,639
Come here! Let's go.

1085
01:52:03,550 --> 01:52:04,915
- Come here!
- What are you doing?

1086
01:52:05,051 --> 01:52:07,019
- Come on!
- Let go of me!

1087
01:52:07,353 --> 01:52:08,911
Wait!

1088
01:52:09,923 --> 01:52:11,948
Wait...

1089
01:52:12,058 --> 01:52:14,151
Wait...

1090
01:52:16,362 --> 01:52:18,330
Wait... wait!

1091
01:52:43,022 --> 01:52:46,423
Go ahead kill me.

1092
01:52:50,563 --> 01:52:53,726
She's fed up with you.

1093
01:52:54,467 --> 01:52:58,028
She wants to go back
to the days with me, got that?

1094
01:52:58,171 --> 01:53:01,607
Good for you.
Congratulations!

1095
01:53:02,041 --> 01:53:05,204
You must be happy.

1096
01:53:05,345 --> 01:53:07,711
You'll be happier in hell!

1097
01:53:13,253 --> 01:53:15,312
Happy now?

1098
01:53:15,455 --> 01:53:17,423
Happy? Happy?

1099
01:53:40,046 --> 01:53:44,415
You're still young.
We'll take care of her.

1100
01:53:45,652 --> 01:53:46,914
No.

1101
01:53:49,989 --> 01:53:52,150
lt runs in the family.

1102
01:53:53,259 --> 01:53:54,920
She seems fine now...

1103
01:53:55,762 --> 01:53:59,323
but soon she won't be able
to control her bladder and worse.

1104
01:54:00,366 --> 01:54:02,129
You can't handle that.

1105
01:54:04,971 --> 01:54:07,496
She's my wife.
l'm taking care of her.

1106
01:54:07,640 --> 01:54:09,801
l know how you feel.

1107
01:54:11,010 --> 01:54:12,978
But you need
to be reasonable.

1108
01:54:16,049 --> 01:54:19,212
Stop it.
She's staying with me.

1109
01:54:19,352 --> 01:54:20,614
Don't be so stubborn!

1110
01:54:20,753 --> 01:54:22,118
Enough!

1111
01:54:27,660 --> 01:54:29,821
- Please leave.
- Chul-soo!

1112
01:54:29,963 --> 01:54:31,931
Su-jin?

1113
01:54:34,968 --> 01:54:36,435
What's going on?

1114
01:54:37,670 --> 01:54:39,137
Anything wrong?

1115
01:54:49,048 --> 01:54:52,415
Su-jin!
Are you okay?

1116
01:54:53,253 --> 01:54:57,417
Open the door.
lt's Mom!

1117
01:55:00,760 --> 01:55:04,127
Open the door!
Su-jin!

1118
01:55:04,264 --> 01:55:07,131
- Su-jin, my poor baby...
- What happened to your arm?

1119
01:55:09,068 --> 01:55:10,626
Su-jin!

1120
01:55:11,871 --> 01:55:17,400
Su-jin, open the door.
lt's your mom.

1121
01:55:17,543 --> 01:55:19,101
lt's me.

1122
01:55:31,457 --> 01:55:32,719
Happy birthday.

1123
01:55:52,445 --> 01:55:55,312
Keep out

1124
01:57:12,558 --> 01:57:14,423
Can the window be bigger?

1125
01:57:14,560 --> 01:57:15,720
Why not?

1126
01:57:16,963 --> 01:57:18,624
l'll fix it later tonight

1127
01:57:19,565 --> 01:57:20,725
How much bigger?

1128
01:57:23,369 --> 01:57:26,998
l don't know.
Just want more sun.

1129
01:57:27,140 --> 01:57:28,300
Okay.

1130
01:57:33,046 --> 01:57:34,308
Bye.

1131
01:57:46,359 --> 01:57:47,621
Young-min.

1132
01:57:51,864 --> 01:57:53,024
Yes?

1133
01:57:53,966 --> 01:57:55,331
l love you.

1134
01:57:59,472 --> 01:58:00,598
Me, too.

1135
01:58:10,149 --> 01:58:11,616
l'll be home early.

1136
01:58:42,248 --> 01:58:43,806
One at a time!

1137
01:58:50,456 --> 01:58:52,720
She doesn't recognize me
anymore.

1138
01:58:52,859 --> 01:58:54,224
She doesn't?

1139
01:58:54,360 --> 01:58:58,729
l know how that feels
but don't let it eat you up.

1140
01:58:58,865 --> 01:59:01,527
lt's the recent memories
that disappear first.

1141
01:59:05,071 --> 01:59:09,303
That's what Alzheimer's does.

1142
01:59:10,543 --> 01:59:13,512
No point in blaming the patient.

1143
01:59:14,213 --> 01:59:16,477
Looking straight into my eyes...

1144
01:59:19,952 --> 01:59:22,011
She calls me by the name
of her ex-lover.

1145
01:59:27,260 --> 01:59:29,228
And she says
l love you.

1146
01:59:34,267 --> 01:59:36,531
Who does she really love?

1147
01:59:44,143 --> 01:59:46,202
She misses those days.

1148
01:59:48,047 --> 01:59:49,014
Right?

1149
01:59:49,148 --> 01:59:53,414
That's just what remains
in her memory.

1150
01:59:55,054 --> 01:59:59,923
You received her love, not me.

1151
02:00:02,261 --> 02:00:03,728
Ask yourself.

1152
02:00:08,768 --> 02:00:10,235
What the hell are you
talking about?

1153
02:00:10,369 --> 02:00:13,600
You got us redo this
three times already.

1154
02:00:13,739 --> 02:00:16,606
Now that you're in suits
want to have fun with your wife?

1155
02:00:16,742 --> 02:00:18,403
While we finish up all this?

1156
02:00:18,544 --> 02:00:20,705
Damn, let's talk sense here, man.

1157
02:00:24,350 --> 02:00:27,513
Chil-bok, l...

1158
02:00:33,559 --> 02:00:34,821
Who am l?

1159
02:00:35,761 --> 02:00:36,921
What?

1160
02:00:37,964 --> 02:00:39,522
Am l that bad?

1161
02:00:45,271 --> 02:00:46,431
What's wrong?

1162
02:00:46,505 --> 02:00:48,871
Hey, Chul-soo
Great job, isn't it?

1163
02:00:49,008 --> 02:00:51,875
- Chul-soo!
- Chul-soo... Chul-soo!

1164
02:00:54,146 --> 02:00:59,413
How to read time.

1165
02:01:29,982 --> 02:01:32,450
Su-jin, ChuI-soo

1166
02:03:09,515 --> 02:03:13,474
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

1167
02:03:13,619 --> 02:03:16,281
I never meant to break
your heart.

1168
02:03:16,422 --> 02:03:17,582
God, what have I done?

1169
02:03:17,723 --> 02:03:19,691
Are you crying now?

1170
02:03:19,825 --> 02:03:25,127
I didn't want to see you
crying or in pain.

1171
02:03:25,231 --> 02:03:27,392
I wanted to make you happy.

1172
02:03:27,533 --> 02:03:30,866
But aII I've done is put
you in agony.

1173
02:03:31,604 --> 02:03:35,267
ChuI-soo!
Oh my Iove ChuI-soo.

1174
02:03:35,408 --> 02:03:37,672
Don't get me wrong.

1175
02:03:37,810 --> 02:03:39,368
I onIy Iove you and onIy you.

1176
02:03:39,512 --> 02:03:43,380
I onIy think of you.
I onIy remember you.

1177
02:03:43,516 --> 02:03:47,976
How badIy do I wish
to show you my heart!

1178
02:03:48,120 --> 02:03:52,784
Is there any way I can do that
whiIe my memory remains?

1179
02:03:52,925 --> 02:03:55,189
Oh, my heart races.

1180
02:03:56,429 --> 02:04:01,594
I, Kim Su-jin
Iove you Choi ChuI-soo, onIy.

1181
02:04:01,734 --> 02:04:05,170
I don't want to forget that.
And I must not.

1182
02:04:05,304 --> 02:04:07,067
Can you see that?

1183
02:04:07,206 --> 02:04:09,367
Can you feeI my heart?

1184
02:04:10,810 --> 02:04:13,370
I'm afraid my just-returned
memory wiII Ieave me again...

1185
02:04:13,512 --> 02:04:17,175
... before I teII you everything
I have to say.

1186
02:04:17,316 --> 02:04:20,285
I Iove you.
And I'm sorry.

1187
02:04:23,222 --> 02:04:26,487
I met you
because I was forgetfuI.

1188
02:04:26,625 --> 02:04:29,492
I'm Ieaving you
because I'm forgetfuI.

1189
02:04:29,628 --> 02:04:33,997
You were the best thing
that ever happened to me.

1190
02:04:34,133 --> 02:04:39,070
How thankfuI I am to God
for having sent you as gift to me.

1191
02:04:39,205 --> 02:04:41,469
I don't have to remember you.

1192
02:04:41,607 --> 02:04:44,576
You're a part of me.

1193
02:04:44,710 --> 02:04:49,909
I smiIe, Iaugh, and smeII Iike you do.

1194
02:04:50,115 --> 02:04:52,276
I might forget you,

1195
02:04:52,418 --> 02:04:55,683
but nothing can drive you
out of my body.

1196
02:04:55,821 --> 02:05:00,588
AIthough you've never toId me
you Ioved me...

1197
02:05:00,726 --> 02:05:05,288
I know deep in my heart
that you Iove me.

1198
02:05:05,431 --> 02:05:10,459
Forgive me for Ieaving you.
PIease...

1199
02:05:11,403 --> 02:05:15,965
For the Iast time
I have a favor to ask.

1200
02:05:16,108 --> 02:05:18,143
PIease see my father.

1201
02:05:18,143 --> 02:05:21,909
Petition for Divorce

1202
02:05:37,062 --> 02:05:41,624
You've had a hard time
ever since you were born.

1203
02:05:44,069 --> 02:05:46,333
That miserable pain of the past...

1204
02:05:47,940 --> 02:05:50,500
is about to bring you a fortune.

1205
02:05:50,643 --> 02:05:54,704
And you are blowing it away?
Does it make sense?

1206
02:05:55,147 --> 02:05:57,707
Go!
Go back to work!

1207
02:06:00,452 --> 02:06:01,919
Man, Su-jin...

1208
02:06:06,158 --> 02:06:11,118
Do you know the saying...
Forgiving is just giving your hate

1209
02:06:11,864 --> 02:06:13,024
a little room in your heart?

1210
02:06:21,840 --> 02:06:24,001
She's given me a lot.

1211
02:06:26,979 --> 02:06:32,042
l have something to tell her...
before she forgets me completely.

1212
02:06:36,589 --> 02:06:38,250
lf l don't...

1213
02:06:40,559 --> 02:06:42,823
my life will be meaningless.

1214
02:06:50,669 --> 02:06:54,298
Missing Person

1215
02:07:00,145 --> 02:07:04,912
Can I ask you this

1216
02:07:06,852 --> 02:07:11,312
When the memory caIIs

1217
02:07:13,559 --> 02:07:25,335
I can taIk about our Iove story
aII over again

1218
02:07:26,939 --> 02:07:38,908
You watching me asIeep
and You in my dream

1219
02:07:40,853 --> 02:07:53,926
WiII never fade away
A memory to remember forever

1220
02:08:04,843 --> 02:08:07,505
l like dust.

1221
02:08:08,647 --> 02:08:11,810
When it's all over me...
lt feels good.

1222
02:08:13,752 --> 02:08:15,720
When the sadness
is all over me.

1223
02:08:18,157 --> 02:08:19,419
l can just...

1224
02:08:20,659 --> 02:08:23,127
Just dust it off.

1225
02:08:25,764 --> 02:08:28,232
Light... Got a light?

1226
02:08:31,070 --> 02:08:35,404
Love and money are
like this cigarettes.

1227
02:08:36,041 --> 02:08:38,703
What's the use
without a light?

1228
02:08:39,445 --> 02:08:41,811
Can you love without light?

1229
02:08:42,748 --> 02:08:44,010
Cigarette...

1230
02:08:44,850 --> 02:08:46,511
l'll just chuck it away.

1231
02:08:46,652 --> 02:08:49,314
Chuck it, chuck it.

1232
02:08:50,456 --> 02:08:52,321
Chuck it, chuck it.

1233
02:08:52,958 --> 02:08:55,927
Same with your sadness

1234
02:08:57,062 --> 02:08:58,427
like this...

1235
02:09:02,201 --> 02:09:08,162
You're turning away

1236
02:09:08,640 --> 02:09:15,011
I can't hide my tears

1237
02:09:15,147 --> 02:09:20,312
I couIdn't say I Iove you

1238
02:09:20,452 --> 02:09:29,019
I yearn for that time
I had with you

1239
02:09:29,161 --> 02:09:36,932
My beIoved memory
cannot be erased...

1240
02:09:37,069 --> 02:09:38,434
Want to have a go again?

1241
02:09:47,346 --> 02:09:48,506
Hey.

1242
02:09:49,948 --> 02:09:51,415
You're so inconsiderate.

1243
02:09:52,351 --> 02:09:54,216
You should've given me
a chance.

1244
02:10:00,058 --> 02:10:02,026
How could you leave me
like that?

1245
02:10:04,763 --> 02:10:06,230
l'm all alone again.

1246
02:10:32,257 --> 02:10:35,420
Choi ChuI-soo

1247
02:10:38,063 --> 02:10:40,623
Gangneung

1248
02:10:59,952 --> 02:11:03,786
StrangeIy, I remember
everything today.

1249
02:11:03,922 --> 02:11:06,686
The batting range, the store...
everything!

1250
02:11:08,327 --> 02:11:10,989
Maybe this is the Iast time.

1251
02:11:11,129 --> 02:11:14,394
So I'm writing to you
whiIe I can.

1252
02:11:15,634 --> 02:11:20,594
The highest mountain in Korea
is Mt. Baekdu 2,744 meters.

1253
02:11:20,739 --> 02:11:24,903
That coke I snatched
from you was 70 cents.

1254
02:11:26,144 --> 02:11:28,806
I'm doing weII.

1255
02:11:28,947 --> 02:11:32,007
The second highest is
Mt. HaIIa 1,950 meters.

1256
02:11:32,150 --> 02:11:33,117
See?

1257
02:11:33,852 --> 02:11:36,685
You don't have to worry
about me.

1258
02:11:36,822 --> 02:11:39,188
Santa CIause is December 25

1259
02:11:40,525 --> 02:11:41,583
Pretty good, right?

1260
02:11:43,128 --> 02:11:48,191
You can forget me now
to make us even.

1261
02:11:48,333 --> 02:11:52,201
Meet someone
nice and be happy.

1262
02:11:52,337 --> 02:11:57,707
Don't Iose your temper.
You don't Iook cooI.

1263
02:11:57,843 --> 02:12:01,210
You might not know it
but you're a good husband.

1264
02:12:03,048 --> 02:12:07,917
I know that for a fact
because I was your wife.

1265
02:12:08,053 --> 02:12:11,887
Don't try to find me,
ChuI-soo.

1266
02:12:12,024 --> 02:12:12,991
Goodbye.

1267
02:12:26,638 --> 02:12:30,904
Some days she can't get
dressed without help.

1268
02:12:32,044 --> 02:12:35,810
She's adapting well though.

1269
02:12:58,537 --> 02:13:04,134
She tore up all the pictures
except that one.

1270
02:13:04,843 --> 02:13:05,810
This way.

1271
