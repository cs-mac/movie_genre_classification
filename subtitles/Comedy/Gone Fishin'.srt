1
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:38,269
This summer's gonna
be great, right, Gus?

2
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:41,364
- Yeah, it can't get
any worse than last summer.
- That's for sure.

3
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:43,875
See, last summer was
a learning experience.

4
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:47,276
For instance, we learned where
my father keeps his cigars.

5
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,349
Now, Joe, you shouldn't be smokin'.
Man, it's bad for you.

6
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,874
Rolled on the thighs
of Cuban honeys.

7
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:56,478
- I swear, this summer's gonna be a ten.
- Ten plus.

8
00:00:56,556 --> 00:01:00,993
Borderline 11!

9
00:01:09,102 --> 00:01:12,833
See? I told you
not to be smoking.

10
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:31,752
Holy smokes!

11
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:34,259
Hey, Gus.

12
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:09,386
Hey, Joe.

13
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:17,026
Oh, Gus!

14
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:19,697
- This is gonna be great, isn't it?
- It's gonna be a ten, Joe.

15
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,706
A ten? A ten plus.

16
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,641
Borderline 11!

17
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:34,013
- It's quiet in here, Joe.
- Boy, it is.
I wonder where everybody is.

18
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,851
- Oh, it sounds like
they're in the kitchen.

19
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:40,552
I don't care what they say, all right?

20
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:43,027
It doesn't matter
what people say.

21
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:46,030
But they called
Pops and Uncle Gus jerks.

22
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:49,033
If they
were jerks, they wouldn't
have won the fishing contest.

23
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:51,228
We weren't gonna let them
get away with this.

24
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:54,329
All right, you heard me.
No more fightin', all right?

25
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:57,172
- Your fathers are not jerks.
- Yeah, tell that...

26
00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:59,575
Hey, w-what's goin' on?

27
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:02,876
Take a look at your sons.

28
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:05,314
Were you guys, uh,
playin' football again?

29
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:08,115
They're gonna be good
football players, Joe.

30
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,486
- They sure are, Gus.
They're gonna be great like Gus.
- Yeah. Yeah.

31
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,321
So, does anybody want
to help us pack or what?

32
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:18,831
- I want to help, but I wanna
just tell you one thing.
- Would you help your fathers?

33
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:21,731
- Uh-oh, here comes
Little Miss One Thing's speech.

34
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:24,531
Gus, this Billy "Catch" Pooler's
the best, ain't he?

35
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:27,505
Even though they say that
only idiots use these lures,

36
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,805
it's the idiots who ain't
using 'em that's the idiots.

37
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:34,107
We won his fishin' contest, Joe.
Man, I can't believe it!

38
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,114
- And remember...
- He's the greatest, Joe.

39
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,344
- Dad, look. Are you
gonna wear your shorts?
- Yeah, they're my lucky shorts.

40
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,944
Baby, get my lucky shorts
too, okay?

41
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:44,421
You gotta be the one
you want to catch.

42
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:46,856
- Yeah, you can have that.
- Hey, keep packing, guys.

43
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:49,417
It's the hands, the hands.
Believe in your hands.

44
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:52,226
- You gotta flick.
- Flick.

45
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:55,029
- And dip.
- Dip.

46
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:57,364
- Flick.
- Flick.

47
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:59,997
- And dip.
- Dip.

48
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:03,474
Okay, everybody, come on. Let's
help the contest winners pack.

49
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:08,574
Okay, everybody.
You're doing a good job.

50
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:10,615
Okay, everybody out now.

51
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:14,779
- Thanks. All right.
- 'Cause me and Aunt Cookie wanna
say one thing to your fathers.

52
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:17,790
- Find mine, Tracey.
- All right, listen.

53
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:22,089
We know how important
this trip is to you. We really do.

54
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:24,619
- But I just gotta say this one thing.
- One thing.

55
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:27,495
- Thanksgiving's on Thursday, you know?
- Thursday.

56
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:29,694
And call me silly,
but I'm worried...

57
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:32,930
that you're gonna end up
in the hospital or somethin'
like last year.

58
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:36,203
- Or in jail like you did
the year before.
- Yeah.

59
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:39,734
- Everything's gonna be fine.
Yeah, this is gonna be good.
- Come on. Everything's okay.

60
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:44,613
But here's the thing.
You've gone fishin' every year
since before we knew you,

61
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:48,016
and so far everything
has never been okay and fine.

62
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,612
And you've never been
as far away as Florida.

63
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:53,626
But that's why this trip is so nice.
That's why it's so important.

64
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,060
We're goin' to the Everglades.
That's the biggie, right, Joe?

65
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,927
- Yeah, the Everglades.
Hey, listen to this.
- Everglades, yeah.

66
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:01,262
- We're gonna catch
tarpon, snook, pompano...
- Yeah, tarpon.

67
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,065
- Catch this.
- I know you'll love that.

68
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,695
If you two are not back
by Thanksgiving,

69
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:09,173
we have agreed to kill you.

70
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:11,800
Yeah, that's
what's gonna happen.

71
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:14,072
- Whooooo!
- Whooooo!

72
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:21,476
Donna, don't forget now,

73
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:24,988
because I want
that recipe.

74
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:27,116
Football.
Don't forget football.

75
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:29,218
Bye.

76
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:32,526
- Okay. Hey, 4:30.
- 4:30.

77
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:35,396
- You know, 4:30.
- Open this door.

78
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:38,495
- You got the key, lady?
- No. Here.

79
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:49,406
- Good morning.
- Good morning. Hi, honey.

80
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:58,452
Joe?

81
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:02,352
- Got the boat?
- Check.

82
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:05,989
- Coupons?
- Check.

83
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:09,364
- Beer, gear, Dramamine?
- Check, check, check.

84
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:13,702
- Insert Billy "Catch" Pooler tape.
- Check that too.

85
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:16,571
We've gone fishin'!

86
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:07,684
"What on earth could make
a man happier...

87
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:11,450
than O.F.H. in the G.O. M?"

88
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:13,491
What's that stuff
you was readin'?

89
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:15,652
O.F.H., G.O. M?
What's that mean?

90
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:18,559
That's Optimum Fishing Hour
in the Gulf of Mexico.

91
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:23,194
Hmm, alligators.
Hey, Joe, listen to this.

92
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:27,171
"Alligators will attack their prey,
but not eat them immediately.

93
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:31,073
- "Often, they will drag their
unlucky half-dead victim...

94
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:34,874
"into their cave, where they
will let the carcass rot,

95
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:38,178
nibbling on them
at their delight."

96
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,215
A-And this too.

97
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:46,588
"Legend has it that alligators
are vengeful creatures.

98
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:49,026
"If threatened or disturbed,

99
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:52,792
"they will become obsessed with
their target, not resting...

100
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:57,336
until they have successfully
unleashed their retribution."

101
00:08:57,403 --> 00:08:59,337
- Ohhh!
- Obsessed?

102
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:03,432
Yeah, obsessed, man.
I mean, they could follow you
to the end of the world.

103
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,137
Wow! Hey, check this out.

104
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:12,477
Boy, holy smokes.
Hey, Gus, we don't have
to worry about that, right?

105
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,851
- We're gonna be fishin', right?
- Right, right, right, right.

106
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:19,847
- Yeah. Hey, Joe, it-it's
nice gettin' away, man.
- Oh, yeah.

107
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:22,655
The little one weighs 62.

108
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:40,311
Boy, that's somethin'!

109
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:42,870
Yeah, she's pretty good, huh?

110
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:45,177
It's a killer!

111
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:47,378
I-It's okay.

112
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,581
And it's got some fish.

113
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:53,183
Yeah. Hey, what kind
of fish is that?

114
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:56,285
- Ah, a grouper.
- Grouper, huh? And what's this?

115
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,729
That's a strawberry grouper.

116
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:01,733
Strawberry grouper, huh?
I thought it was a salmon.

117
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:03,894
- Yeah, that's a strawberry grouper.
- What's this one, Gus?

118
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:06,597
- Kingfish.
- Kingfish, huh?

119
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:09,904
Yeah.

120
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:13,945
Hey, Gus, if we had money,
we'd set this up different.
We'd catch a lot of fish.

121
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:15,446
- Yeah, who needs it?
- Yeah.

122
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:17,141
- Guys who can't fish.
- Exactly.

123
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:20,208
L-Look at it this way.
You was a great football player, right?

124
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:22,812
- Yeah.
- If a great football player
got a bad football...

125
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:24,823
- He's still a great football player.
- Exactly.

126
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:27,325
Hey, how about this clean,
fresh Florida air?

127
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,659
Hey, a real Florida
palm tree in the flesh.

128
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:34,359
Holy smoke! Gus,
I never thought I'd see a palm tree.

129
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:38,130
- I feel like a million dollars, Joe.
- I feel like two million.

130
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:40,831
Let's go eat.

131
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:42,841
- And then fish.
- Yeah.

132
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:47,437
No, no. You got the last one.
It's on me. Forget about it.

133
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:50,071
Hey, Joe, check out
them ugly sticks.

134
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:52,150
Hey, don't say that.

135
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:55,676
- They gonna break.
- You got number nine ready?

136
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:59,054
- Here you go.
- Let's sit over here.
Hey, don't say that.

137
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:01,889
Hey, Gus, I can't
believe you. You tell me,
"Look at these ugly chicks."

138
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,588
I was gonna laugh right
in their faces over there.

139
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,825
I said, "Ugly sticks."
For fishin'.

140
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:10,232
Oh, I thought you said
"ugly chicks" 'cause this
girl's sittin' there.

141
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:14,102
You gotta have ugly sticks
here because they feed
a lot of fishermen.

142
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:15,901
- Hiya.
- Hi.

143
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:17,408
Y'all know
what you want?

144
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,501
Uh...

145
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:22,206
Hey, Gus. What do you
think, Gus? Should I get
this Southern Plate?

146
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:24,612
Then you can have
my toast and my bacon.

147
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:26,912
Yeah, then I'll get the
Fisherman's Feast, and you can
have my sausage and pancakes.

148
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,953
If you're gonna do that,

149
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,114
why don't I get
the Mariner and you can have
the whole side of ham?

150
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:34,124
Oh, never mind us.
This happens all the time.

151
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:37,059
Must be enjoyable for ya.

152
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:41,623
May I suggest
the Panama Platter?
It really hit the spot.

153
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:43,635
Oh, yeah? Thanks.

154
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:46,729
Um... what do you think?
Shall we get a couple of those?

155
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:48,831
- Yeah, a couple of those.
- Two of those?

156
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,638
- A couple of those, yeah.
- Yeah. Thanks.

157
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:55,279
- Gus, check this out.
- Yeah.

158
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:59,044
- Pure Billy "Catch" Pooler.
Watch this.
- Okay.

159
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:01,178
Back, drop.

160
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,586
- Back, drop.
- Y-You're flickin' too much.

161
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:07,285
- I can't get the flick.
- Okay, wait. Let me show you.

162
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:09,294
Which is the flick?
Which is the dip?

163
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:12,297
Think of flick
instead of flip.

164
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:14,128
- Flick.
- Flick, dip.

165
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,601
See, I can't...
I get the flick and the dip
mixed all the time.

166
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:19,898
- Uh, pardon me.
- Oh, sorry.

167
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:23,497
- I couldn't help noticing you have a
fishing lure on your key ring.
- Yeah.

168
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:26,442
- That wouldn't be
a deadly invader, would it?
- It is!

169
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:28,707
- You fish?
- Not professionally.

170
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:30,748
You could call me
a frustrated amateur.

171
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:34,115
You're a frustrated amateur.

172
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:37,316
- That's good.
- I was just kiddin'.
Just makin' a joke.

173
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:39,449
- It was a joke.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

174
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:42,824
What about you two?
You're professionals, right?

175
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:45,456
Well, I guess you could
say that, in a way.

176
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:49,365
We're semipro.
We won a lot of fishin' medals
and things like that.

177
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,835
- Not lately, though.
- Well, scout camp...

178
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:55,031
That counts, doesn't it?
Stuff like that.

179
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:58,440
- The reason I ask is... Sorry. Sorry.
- Oh.

180
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:01,513
- Do you mind if I join you?
- No, come on.

181
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,378
Thanks.

182
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:07,509
You see, my father was
a professional fisherman.

183
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:09,884
- Really?
- He was telling me...

184
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:12,823
that he was working
on the deadly invader.

185
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:16,419
You know, I think
this might have been one
of his last original designs.

186
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:19,191
- By the way, I'm Joe.
- Oh, uh, Martin.

187
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,823
- How ya doin'?
- Martin Jeffries.

188
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,925
Gus. Yeah.

189
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:26,938
- Anyway, are you two married?
- Uh, yeah, yeah.

190
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:29,804
- Children?
- No, they're our age.

191
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:32,400
- No, I don't think
that's what he meant.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

192
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:34,945
- Do you have children?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

193
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:37,413
- They all get together.
- They're great kids, though.

194
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:40,713
- See, Fiona and I,
we never had children.
- Oh, geez.

195
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:43,847
When Fiona died,
I suddenly realized...

196
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:46,255
I'd wasted so much
of my life, you know?

197
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:49,419
- I'd spent 20 years behind a desk.
- That's a long time to sit.

198
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:52,827
- You're 100% right.
- Right, Joe?

199
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:57,062
- I was always jealous of men like you.
- Really?

200
00:13:57,136 --> 00:14:00,469
Of course, I'm changing all that now,
you know. My life's different.

201
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:04,567
Listen, I won't hold you up.
Anyway, look, it was
a real honor meeting you.

202
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,202
- Hey, the pleasure's ours.
- Yeah, thanks.

203
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:09,679
Thanks so much.
And good luck with the fishing.

204
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:12,183
- Yeah.
- Hey, try fishing.
You'll see.

205
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:15,685
- I'll give it a try.
- All right. He's a nice guy, huh?

206
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:18,713
Hey, what kind of accent
is that? Polish or somethin'?

207
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,089
- I think it's Irish.
- Yeah, Irish, Scottish.

208
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:25,495
Here. I'm glad y'all didn't buy
a bridge from that gentleman.

209
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:28,795
Why? He seemed
like a nice guy. He didn't
try to sell us anything.

210
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:32,827
- Seemed like a nice guy
havin' a tough time.
- Oh, really?

211
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:35,840
- Poor guy just recently
lost his wife, you know?
- Yeah.

212
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:39,035
Did you know you just recently
lost your car?

213
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:41,704
- There's a car just like mine!
- Joe, that's your car!

214
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:45,614
It is! With my keys!

215
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:48,916
Hey, Joe!

216
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,998
Holy smokes!

217
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:03,667
It's simple.

218
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:06,602
When we find that guy
who stole my mom's money
and broke her heart,

219
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:08,606
I'm gonna kill him.

220
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,373
- Food.
- What... What?

221
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:19,974
- Food.
- Oh, no. Come on.
We already lost two hours.

222
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:28,888
- Hi.
- Hi. How are you?

223
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:33,126
Okay.
What happened?

224
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:36,793
Oh, we just had ourselves
a little boatin' accident.

225
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:39,633
Some fella stole a car.

226
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:43,807
- Big mess.
- Oh, yeah?

227
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:47,504
He didn't happen to look
like this guy, did he?

228
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:52,247
Well, that was him.

229
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:55,151
- He was here!
- Well, when did he leave?

230
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,849
- A couple hours ago.
- Was he alone?

231
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:00,755
When he got here.

232
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:04,058
Then he sat over at that table
with a couple of fellas and...

233
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:07,691
they chit-chatted for a while
and... and he took their car.

234
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:13,567
Those guys whose car was stolen,
what about them?

235
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:17,665
Oh, you shouldn't have
any trouble findin' them.

236
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:32,990
My poor car, Gus.
My poor car.

237
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:36,688
My poor feet. Hey.

238
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,397
Hey, you dorks!

239
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:58,605
This trip ain't even a one.
It's a friggin' zero.

240
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:01,483
- It could be worse, Joe.
- How could it be worse?

241
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:04,147
You can't get any lower
than zero, right, Gus?

242
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:07,852
Hey, at least we're alive.
We almost got killed by our own boat.

243
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:11,659
My life stinks, Gus. But it stunk
a lot less when my car was in it.

244
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:14,665
- Yeah.
- That car meant a lot to me, Gus.

245
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:17,895
I got memories of that car
I can't even remember.

246
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:20,665
Yeah, but at least
we're goin' fishing.

247
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:22,798
Yeah.

248
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:25,308
- Hey, Joe?
- Yeah?

249
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:28,972
I-I was just thinkin;
Say, 100 years ago
we were goin' fishin;

250
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,676
- This is what we'd be doin'.
- What do you mean?

251
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,777
Yeah, think about it.

252
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,584
This is how we'd get
our boat to the water.

253
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:41,022
So we can't let that guy ruin
our Florida vacation, eh?

254
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:43,186
Hey, maybe you're right.

255
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:47,698
Yeah, and 1,000 years ago,
we wouldn't even have paved roads.

256
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:51,896
Hey, that's right, Gus. It would be
filled with rocks and everything, right?

257
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:54,404
Y-Y-Yeah. And the boats
would be heavier.

258
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:58,909
That's right. We got
the latest technology wood.
This boat's light, right, Gus?

259
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:01,775
Yeah, and guess what, Joe?
A million years ago,

260
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:05,248
we wouldn't even have
wheels for our trailer.

261
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:08,444
We wouldn't even have
a friggin' trailer, right, Gus?

262
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:11,945
A-A-And Gus, if it was that long ago,
our brains would be smaller.

263
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:15,460
- We wouldn't even think
about anything like that.
- Oh, man, yeah.

264
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:19,453
- So, it may not be a ten yet,
- Yeah.

265
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:22,467
but it definitely ain't a zero.

266
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,765
Hey, hey!

267
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,771
- Hey, Gus, they're pulling over.
- Yeah.

268
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:32,275
- Hey.
- Hey, Gus.

269
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:35,280
- Yeah?
- Babes.

270
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:38,112
You guys need a ride?

271
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,516
Gus, what kind of knot
did you tie?

272
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:45,682
A double shambo
figure eight.

273
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:50,194
You went over, under, over.
Uh, the shambo goes over, under, under.

274
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:54,391
- Hey, Joe, trust me. It's over, under.
- It's under, under.

275
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:59,195
- Hi.
- Hi.

276
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:02,467
Hey, it's really nice
of you girls to give us a ride.
We really appreciate it.

277
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,475
- Yeah.
- You're welcome.

278
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:06,773
It's really too bad
about your car. I feel bad.

279
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:09,439
- We feel bad too, yeah.
- Yeah. Hmm.

280
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:12,041
- Did you report the car stolen?
- Yeah, with the deputy.

281
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:15,279
'Cause the sheriff was out fishin'.
Ain't that a bummer?

282
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:18,152
Y-You know the... You know your license
plate number, right?

283
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,954
That's the one thing
that Joe does remember.

284
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,757
That's right.
Uh, "JGTT 542."

285
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:27,788
- Can you... What is it? "J" what?
- Wait. Could you do that again?

286
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:30,801
- Maybe I'll bump into
the police, and I can help you.
- Yeah, that's a great idea.

287
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:34,100
- Thank you. That's nice of you.
- One more time.

288
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:36,174
- "J" for Joe, "G" for Gus...
- That's me.

289
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,369
"T" for tuna,
"T” for trout.

290
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:40,809
- "5." I was five years old
the first time I tasted beer.
- Yeah.

291
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:44,975
And "42" was
Gus's old football jersey before
he dislocated both his knees.

292
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,475
Yeah, but that's not
how I hurt my knees, you know.
I sleepwalk when I eat red meat.

293
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,819
- Sleepwalk?
- That's right. Hey, listen to this.

294
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:54,984
One time at a July 4th
barbecue we had...

295
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:59,530
After it was over,
Gus sleepwalked all the way over
to the 7-11 on the interstate.

296
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:03,090
Got wiped out by a motorcycle.
Almost killed him. Hey,
true story, I swear to God.

297
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:05,103
- It's a true story.
- Right, Gus?

298
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,104
- Yeah, right.
- Excuse us.

299
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,106
Hey, we'll
talk to you later.

300
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:16,110
Hey, hey, you know, Joe?

301
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:18,241
Life is so
unpredictable, man.

302
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:20,615
One minute,
we're draggin' our boat,

303
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:23,348
next minute, we're gettin'
a ride with babes!

304
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:27,518
Hey, you know somethin' else?
I think they find us attractive.

305
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:30,117
- Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Notice that?

306
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:32,221
Hey, maybe
they think we're cute.

307
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:34,526
- Yeah, yeah.
- W-Why not? What's wrong with us?

308
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:37,431
We have the license plate
number. We know that
it's a blue Barracuda.

309
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:40,130
And if we see this guy,
we're going to call the police.

310
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,230
- Of course, we're gonna call the police.
- Okay.

311
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:44,832
- Hey, hey, remember the killer looks?
- The what?

312
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:46,968
- The killer looks.
- Killer looks?

313
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:50,845
Oh, Joe! Your memory's so bad.
In high school.

314
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:54,579
We'd be sittin' in the bleachers
and givin' the killer looks...

315
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:57,747
to Susan Dixon
and Marilyn Mitchell.

316
00:20:57,856 --> 00:20:59,847
- Oh, yeah! Killer looks!
- Yeah.

317
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,620
What we gotta do is figure out
what to do with these guys.

318
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:06,095
You know what?
I was thinkin' of that low-down dir...

319
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:08,792
That's if...

320
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:11,200
- Hi.
- Hi.

321
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:13,601
What's wrong?
Are you guys all right?

322
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:15,400
Oh, we're good, yeah.

323
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:18,999
Okay, well, um, look,
I just need to ask you...
The guy who stole your car...

324
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:23,138
Was he carrying anything?
Like a... Like a black bag
or a suitcase or...

325
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:27,208
Uh, it was... It looked
more like a purse to me.

326
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:30,345
Yeah, yeah, he was a man
with a purse, yeah.

327
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:33,016
Oh, yeah, well, this guy
with the purse, did he maybe...

328
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,650
tell you which way he was going
or something like that?

329
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:38,924
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
- Uh, no. That's all we know, really.

330
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:42,228
- Let me ask you a question: How come
you're asking so many questions?
- Yeah.

331
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:45,464
Well, it's because...
The guy who stole your car...

332
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:49,631
No, the guy...

333
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:53,541
- Hey, Joe, the beer!
- Gus! Get the beer, Gus!

334
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,545
- I got it, Joe.
- Get the beer.

335
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:58,241
Hey, Joe!

336
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,682
Hey, good save, Gus!
Good save!

337
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,791
Oh, Gus!

338
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:09,986
J-Joe!

339
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:13,929
Hey, Joe!

340
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,399
Hey, Joe!

341
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:20,598
Hey, hold on, Joe!
I'm coming!

342
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:31,046
- Thanks, Gus.
- Hey.

343
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:37,211
Hey, Gus, I told you
it was under and under.

344
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:39,313
Yeah, okay, Joe.
Maybe you're right.

345
00:22:39,424 --> 00:22:43,019
Hey, nice R.V., Gus.

346
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:50,462
Hey, Gus, is there any way
to steer this thing?

347
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:53,527
I-I-I don't know. We better
find a way to stop it, though.

348
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:57,940
- Where'd they go?
- What?

349
00:22:57,976 --> 00:22:59,534
Th-They're gone.

350
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:02,807
- The boat, the beer,
everything. They're gone!
- Weird.

351
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,974
- Hey, Gus.
- Huh?

352
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:07,984
- The anchor.
- Get it, Joe. Throw it.

353
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:20,926
- Hey, Gus.
- Yeah.

354
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:22,330
- It was just like a ride.
- Yeah.

355
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:25,700
Uh-oh.

356
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:28,830
- Train!
- Train!

357
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:33,007
- Hey, Gus, you pushing or pulling?
- Pushin'.

358
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:35,545
It's stuck on something.

359
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:38,844
Joe, go get the...
go get the anchor!

360
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:44,618
- Hurry up!
- I'm doin' it.

361
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:46,624
Hurry up!

362
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,222
Let's go.

363
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:09,078
Boy, that was close, Gus.

364
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:38,702
You know who I
feel sorry for, Gus?

365
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:41,540
- Who?
- Those girls. You know, the babes.

366
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:44,411
- Yeah.
- I bet they're drivin' all around
lookin' for us, right?

367
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:46,609
Yeah, you're
probably right, Joe.

368
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:49,415
Hey, look at this setup,
huh, Gus?

369
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:51,547
Where're you
guys headed?

370
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:53,648
Uh, we're goin'
to the Everglades.

371
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:55,659
- Hop in.
- Hey, thanks.

372
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:10,564
I usually use
a 80-pound test line...

373
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:15,078
with a Bluefin II
1955 stand-up rods with those uni-butts,

374
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:17,308
so I can pull it out of the rod holder
when the fish is pulling hard.

375
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:19,316
Do you anchor
or do you drift?

376
00:25:19,384 --> 00:25:22,478
We usually power drift
along the break, if we can find one.

377
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:24,987
- Yeah.
- And set each hook bait
with a different depth.

378
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:27,991
Man, we know a ton
of great fishin' secrets.

379
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:30,323
Last year, the Everglades
were like a feeding frenzy.

380
00:25:30,395 --> 00:25:32,590
No way you weren't
gonna catch some beauties.

381
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:35,689
Don't worry about your boat.
Ours is big enough for all four of us.

382
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:38,828
- Hey, Joe!
- Hey, Gus, that's my car!

383
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:43,399
Hey, stop!

384
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:46,907
We'll be all right now.
I got my car.

385
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:49,209
- Hey, where are you guys headin'?
- Tigertail Lagoon.

386
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:51,714
- Hey, we'll see you there.
- Good luck.

387
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:55,047
- Guys are lucky, ain't they?
- Yeah. Oh, man, I know.

388
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,918
I wish I was them.

389
00:25:57,956 --> 00:26:00,982
Hey, where is the guy
that, uh, parked this car?

390
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:03,550
- Yeah.
- He's in the john.

391
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:09,365
- What are you doin; Joey?
- He's gonna get a little
piece of Newark, Gus.

392
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:12,368
- Oh, come on, Joey. It ain't worth it.
- It's worth it, Gus.

393
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:15,405
- No, it's not worth it, Joey!
- It's worth it, Gus!

394
00:26:15,473 --> 00:26:18,601
- Hey, what about O.F.H. first?
- It's worth it.

395
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:22,407
Oh, man.

396
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:04,278
Hey! Hey! Look
what you're doin' there.

397
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:09,454
Hey, what's going on
over there?

398
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:13,260
Joe, what about O.F. H?
Man, we still got time.

399
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,766
It's not worth it!
It's not worth it! He's got a gun!

400
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:18,563
- He's got a gun? Shoot!
- Got a gun.

401
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:24,070
Come on, Joe!
He's got a gun!

402
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,575
Hurry up!

403
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,875
- Hey, mister. Hey!
- Let's go!

404
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:34,076
It's against the law to start your car
while I'm pumping gas!

405
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:36,779
Oh, boy,
that was close, Gus.

406
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:39,187
- That guy could've killed us, Joe.
- I know.

407
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:42,591
- Joe, what happened?
- I went in. I was gonna
hit him with the club, see.

408
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:45,187
- He was lookin' for me. He
was underneath the toilet.
- Yeah, yeah.

409
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:48,324
So I get up on top,
and the club gets caught
on this, uh, thing.

410
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,597
- And I look, and he's got a gun.
- Was it real?

411
00:27:51,636 --> 00:27:54,298
No, he's loadin' a water pistol.
Yeah, it was real!

412
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:57,398
- So I ran outta there right
away, and I ran into you.
- Yeah. Yeah.

413
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:00,137
- Where was you goin'?
- I-I was comin' in to help you.

414
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:03,944
As soon as I tell you it was a gun,
you was the first one in the car.

415
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:07,577
- Yeah, that's why I ran first.
I got longer legs, man.
- Yeah, you were scared, Gus.

416
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:13,090
What's goin' on?

417
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:17,652
- I don't know, man. Yeah.
- God! There must be a fire
or somethin', huh? Man.

418
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:20,665
Hey, Gus, check in there.
See if this guy touched anything.

419
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:23,759
- I'll kill him.
- Better not have touched our tapes.

420
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:27,804
Yeah, the tapes are in there too.
What's that?

421
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:30,602
- A knife.
- Holy smokes!

422
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:33,678
- Yeah.
- Hey, Gus, it looks like
it's got blood on it.

423
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:36,681
Sure does.
There's blood on it, Joe.

424
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:40,480
Hey, we could use it
to scale our fish.

425
00:28:40,585 --> 00:28:43,281
Yeah, that's a good idea.
We'll use it to scale our fish.

426
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:46,721
It feels good to get the car
back, Gus. I'll tell you that.

427
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:48,725
Smells good too.

428
00:28:48,793 --> 00:28:51,193
Yeah.

429
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:54,493
Holy smokes!
Look at this place, Gus!

430
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:57,033
- Yeah, this must be it, Joe.
- Yeah.

431
00:28:57,102 --> 00:28:59,593
But the sign says
"Rod & Gun Club," Gus.

432
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:02,571
Oh. Glory Glades
must be a few miles away.

433
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,733
- Yeah, this ain't it, huh?
- Yeah.

434
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:07,869
- It's probably just as nice.
- I bet it's even nicer.

435
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:11,039
- Yeah, that's right.
- Yeah.

436
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:15,449
So far, Gus, I-I don't
like the landscaping, I'll tell ya that.

437
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:19,082
Yeah, somebody
ain't doin' their job, that's for sure.

438
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:22,024
This must be where the workers stay.
Let's ask somebody.

439
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,220
Yeah, let's go ask.

440
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:24,250
Yeah, let's go ask.

441
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:28,758
Sure doesn't look
like a paradise, Joe.

442
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:36,102
Howdy there, folks.
Can I help y'all?

443
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:38,972
Yeah, we're lookin'
for Glory Glades Lodge.

444
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:40,977
This here's it.

445
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:44,014
- This is it?
- No, no. Like here.

446
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:46,310
- Show him the coupon.
- See? Glory Glades.

447
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:49,683
- That Glory Glades.
- Ah, the lodge!

448
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:51,985
We got two coupons
we won.

449
00:29:52,023 --> 00:29:55,925
It was a beautiful lodge,
but she's gone now.

450
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:59,987
- Gone?
- Hurricane Andrew flattened it
flatter than flat.

451
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:03,590
Took us ten months
to clean this place up.

452
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:09,736
But not to worry. We got plenty of room.
Let me see that coupon again.

453
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:12,800
Oh, yeah, here.

454
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:16,803
Hmm. Well, y'all can stay
in one of them campers.

455
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:23,318
We gotta stay in there?
Both of us?

456
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:28,121
Why, that's a big camper.
There's room for four or five,
and it's just the two of you.

457
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,821
- You ain't got no pets, have you?
- Ain't you got nothin' else?

458
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:34,057
Oh, that's the top of the line.
I don't think you want what else we got.

459
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:36,930
- I guess we'll go check it out.
- Yeah.

460
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:40,131
That's the top of the line.
I just cleaned her out.

461
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:43,834
Hey, hey, give me that!

462
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:46,274
Friggin' slob.

463
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:49,744
I'll tell you what, Gus.
It doesn't look anything
like the picture.

464
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:53,750
Yeah, they should've sent us
a new brochure if they're gonna
change the picture like that.

465
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:57,447
- Yeah.
- Yeah, they got a lotta nerve
callin' this first prize.

466
00:30:57,555 --> 00:31:00,490
- I wonder what the losers got.
Six months in Sing Sing?

467
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:03,688
- Yeah, maybe.
- Careful. Why don't you go first?

468
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:06,491
There might be rats.
Go ahead, you're bigger.

469
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:09,125
- Me?
- Go ahead.

470
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:15,004
It's okay. Come on in, Joe.

471
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,735
- Richard?
- Who was Dionysus?

472
00:31:21,846 --> 00:31:24,314
- Correct.
- Holidays and Observances for 100.

473
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:29,011
In 1915, President Wilson
proclaimed this holiday
as the second Sunday in May.

474
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,111
Richard.

475
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:31,210
- What is Mother's Day?
- Right.

476
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:33,224
Yeah, change it.

477
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:35,123
- It's a stupid show anyway.
- Yeah, I know.

478
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:37,353
Hey, Country's Criminals.
This is a good show.

479
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:40,022
- Yeah, I like this one.
- Yeah, you see some action stuff here.

480
00:31:40,131 --> 00:31:42,964
I love you so much, Gladys.
I could not live without you.

481
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:45,662
- Honestly.
- Sure he could.

482
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,865
Gladys Sussner
is one of 43 women...

483
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:52,535
who this ruthless con artist
married and then stole from.

484
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:54,578
Wow, 43 ladies.

485
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:57,945
And it was Gladys
who was found dead with stab wounds.

486
00:31:57,982 --> 00:32:00,576
This man
is the prime suspect.

487
00:32:00,618 --> 00:32:02,813
- Hey, Gus, look who it is!
- Dekker Massey.

488
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:04,582
- It's the guy who stole my car!
- Yeah!

489
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:08,183
Dekker's partner, his
educationally challenged
brother Quentin...

490
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:11,490
- This guy's a killer,
and we didn't even know it.
- was arrested...

491
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,791
but the police and
the federal authorities...

492
00:32:13,898 --> 00:32:16,696
are still searching for Dekker Massey
and the murder weapon.

493
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:18,793
Hey, we got the evidence.

494
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:20,894
We don't have
any evidence, Joe.

495
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:23,405
- A $100,000 reward...
- A $100,000 reward!

496
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:25,534
for evidence linking
Massey to the crime.

497
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:28,305
- The knife in the car!
- The knife!
Yeah, with the blood on it.

498
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:30,904
- Yeah, with the blood on it.
- Maybe he used that
to stab that poor old lady.

499
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,917
- Yeah.
- Holy smokes, Gus!

500
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,647
And $5 million
in cash and jewelry,

501
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:39,622
believed to have been
hidden away by Dekker's brother,
is still missing.

502
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:42,557
- Joe... We're gonna be rich, Joe!
- We're gonna be rich!

503
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:46,757
- If you can help us, please call today.
- Gus, write down the number!

504
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:50,062
- Write the number down!
- We'll be right back.

505
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:54,070
I don't believe it, Gus.
A hundred thousand dollars.
We're gonna be rich, Gus.

506
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:56,766
All we have to do is turn the knife in,
and we get the reward!

507
00:32:56,841 --> 00:33:00,709
Gus, you know what we'll do.
Tomorrow we buy a fishing boat
first and go fishin'!

508
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:03,804
- Yeah, we'll get a boat
just like our old one, Joe!
- Better! Better, Gus!

509
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:07,282
- Joe, this is easy.
- Oh, man, I can't believe it.

510
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:11,378
- No more worries, Gus.
- No more worries, Joe!

511
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:42,212
Whoo!

512
00:33:45,823 --> 00:33:49,953
I hear you!

513
00:34:04,175 --> 00:34:08,271
What's blank "shrugged."
Five letters, ending in an "S."

514
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:11,815
That'd be "Atlas,"
as in Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand,

515
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:14,384
a Russian-born
American writer.

516
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:16,478
Oh, yeah.

517
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:19,490
Is the manager in?

518
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:21,492
That'd be myself.

519
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:23,619
Yeah?

520
00:34:23,694 --> 00:34:27,721
Wonderful. Listen.

521
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:30,427
I was wondering if you're
still honoring these?

522
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:34,130
What the hell is it with these...
damn coupons?

523
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:37,834
- Why, has somebody else
been in with one?
- Two fellas come in last night.

524
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:40,843
- They still here?
- No, they gone this mornin'.

525
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:43,312
Do you know where
they've gone?

526
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:45,747
They asked me where
they could buy a boat.

527
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:48,752
And did you
suggest a place?

528
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:51,687
Yep.

529
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:55,358
Which place?

530
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:57,724
Phil Beasly's.

531
00:34:57,829 --> 00:35:02,357
Oh, it's nice, Joe.
It has a kitchen.

532
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,868
You know, hey, Joe,
this is real nice.

533
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:07,460
- Hey, let me see.
- Hey, yeah, nice kitchen.

534
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:09,905
- Oh, yeah.
- Beds.

535
00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:12,636
But these are
pleasure boats, Gus.

536
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,768
- See?
- Oh, that's nice, Joe.

537
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:18,280
- They're not fishin' boats.
We don't need that.
- Yeah, we don't need that.

538
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:21,283
The guys who can't fish get these.
They're show-offs.

539
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:24,479
They're pleasure boats.
Here's one like our old one.

540
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:26,649
- Yeah.
- Holy smokes!

541
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:29,022
- Whoo!
- Why is it so expensive, Gus?

542
00:35:29,093 --> 00:35:31,527
- Because we bought ours used
20 years ago.
- Yeah.

543
00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:35,293
Yeah. Hey, Joe, maybe we
oughta just fish off the dock,

544
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:38,630
like we used to do
in the old days, yeah?

545
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:42,139
Look, I don't care.
You wanna just rent one?
We'll rent one.

546
00:35:42,206 --> 00:35:45,801
Yeah, we can rent one.
Then we'll buy a real nice
used one when we get back home.

547
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:49,346
- It's sad, isn't it?
- What?

548
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:52,007
The Little Guy.

549
00:35:52,116 --> 00:35:54,846
That's what we call this boat.
"The Little Guy."

550
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:58,616
- Yeah!
- Oh! 'Cause you got all the
big guys around... I see, yeah.

551
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:01,556
Right.
Phil Beasly, Sr.

552
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:04,254
- Uh, Gus.
- Uh, Joe.

553
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:07,696
Yeah, the Little Guy's sad.
But you know what's sadder?

554
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:12,265
Follow me, guys.

555
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:18,765
- The Little Guy.
- Yeah, but maybe he'll show us
somethin' real nice.

556
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:23,579
- Watch your step here, guys.
- Yeah.

557
00:36:28,819 --> 00:36:31,287
- Hey, how much further?
- Oh, just right up here.

558
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:33,290
- I wanna show you guys
somethin' different.
- All right.

559
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:35,087
- Something special.
- Yeah.

560
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,923
- Most of my customers
just shop the showroom.
- Yeah.

561
00:36:37,995 --> 00:36:40,589
But I can see you guys
are professional fishermen.

562
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,791
I'm sure you can judge
this boat in the water.

563
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:45,597
- We're semipro, not professional.
- You've probably won some awards.

564
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:47,933
- Yeah, we won a few.
- Yeah. Oh, we've won a lot of 'em.

565
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,507
Yeah, well, that's good.
Right here, guys.

566
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:53,510
- Hey, Gus, it's the Ranger 250C.
- Wow!

567
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:56,809
Yeah, the 250C. Let me tell you what's
sad about this boat.

568
00:36:56,914 --> 00:37:00,680
A lot of people look at this
and believe it's only a dream.

569
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:02,946
You fellas know
anyone like that?

570
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:05,683
- Yeah, us.
- But there's nothin'
wrong with lookin'.

571
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:07,849
Good point.

572
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:11,793
I cite this nudie photo
as a prime example.

573
00:37:11,862 --> 00:37:14,558
- You men married?
- Yeah.

574
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:17,090
Then you'll understand me when
I say you're allowed to look.

575
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:19,363
- Yeah.
- That is the American way.

576
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:23,372
You're allowed all the eyeballing
your eyeballs can eyeball.

577
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:27,867
You’re just not allowed to touch.
You're not allowed to play.

578
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:31,415
Well, I got good news
for you guys.

579
00:37:31,482 --> 00:37:36,419
Go right ahead.
Touch. Play.

580
00:37:36,487 --> 00:37:39,081
- Excuse me.
- Thanks a lot, Phil.

581
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:41,784
- Yeah.
- We might as well, Gus.
It can't hurt none, right?

582
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:43,987
Yeah, sure.
Oh, man!

583
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:46,792
- Wow, look at this. This is something.
- Man!

584
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:50,426
How about this guy? Tryin' to give us
the old salesman pitch.

585
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:54,597
With his nudie girl photo.
He never saw a girl
like that in his life.

586
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:57,299
- Yeah, yeah. He tried
to pull one on us.
- Yeah.

587
00:37:57,408 --> 00:37:59,933
- Guys?
- Yeah?

588
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:02,241
Someone I want you to meet.
This is my assistant.

589
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:06,077
Julie, this is Gus and Joe.

590
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:08,550
- Hello, guys.
- Hi.

591
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:11,054
I'll sign those papers now.

592
00:38:11,088 --> 00:38:13,648
Nice boat.
You guys look great in it.

593
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:17,354
- Thanks.
- I'm tellin' you, that baby's cryin;

594
00:38:17,395 --> 00:38:19,556
- Screamin'.
- Yeah.

595
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:22,464
- No, the boat.
- Yeah, that's what I was talkin' about.

596
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,367
Let me tell you something, guys.

597
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:32,067
If I'm not honest with you,
I'm not lyin' to anyone.

598
00:38:32,176 --> 00:38:35,577
I started this business
because I'm a fisherman
and a boatman,

599
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:39,174
not because my time equals sales
plus commission minus overhead.

600
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:41,684
To me, it's
the people that matter.

601
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:44,084
- Yeah, people.
- Yeah. People, yeah.

602
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:47,181
I wouldn't want you
to fall in love with...
just for example...

603
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:49,885
A boat like mine.
That's the Waveliner II.

604
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:52,622
She'd be overkill
for you fellas.

605
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:55,393
- Yeah, overkill. Too much.
- Yeah, overkill.

606
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:58,798
The truth is, this boat you're
standin' in, the Ranger 250C...

607
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:02,033
Gentlemen, this boat...

608
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:05,233
Well... can you
just see the neighbors?

609
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,538
- Yeah, the neighbors.
- The neighbors.

610
00:39:07,578 --> 00:39:09,739
- Wazinski.
- Yeah.

611
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:13,045
Can you just see them?
I'm tellin' you, that's
the best part of my job.

612
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:16,850
Not keepin' boats afloat,
but keepin' a man's self-image
above the water.

613
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:19,252
- Yeah, self-image.
- Self-image, yeah.

614
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:23,555
Y-You see, Phil, we were thinkin' about
buyin' the, uh, Little Guy?

615
00:39:23,594 --> 00:39:25,687
- Yeah. It's too, um...
- But it's too, uh...

616
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:29,062
- Cheap?
- Yeah, cheap.

617
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:32,194
- Where do you fellas fish?
- Glory Glades.

618
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:34,362
Fellas, are you familiar
with the phrase...

619
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:36,770
"No one fishes Glory Glades"?

620
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,774
- No.
- I never heard that.

621
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:41,276
Guys, if you learn
anything from me today,

622
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:44,372
remember the two words...
Tigertail Lagoon.

623
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:47,077
- Hey, that's where Bubba and J. P...
- J.P., yeah.

624
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:49,618
- We got a couple of friends
of ours fish over there.
- Yeah, yeah.

625
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:52,918
It's where I fish.
Here, have a pen.

626
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:55,390
- Hey.
- Hey.

627
00:39:55,493 --> 00:39:57,222
Yeah.

628
00:39:57,294 --> 00:40:01,890
- Phil, would you sign this for me?
- Oh, yeah. Gladly.

629
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:05,102
Are you guys okay?

630
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:07,104
- Fine, thanks.
- Yeah, fine.

631
00:40:07,204 --> 00:40:10,298
- Okay. Thank you.
- Thank you, Julie.

632
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:16,005
Thank you, Julie. Uh, Phil, you know,
there's no way we can afford...

633
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:20,709
Gus, prices are relative to your outlook
and how you approach a matter.

634
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:24,517
- For example, I say ten dollars.
- Yeah.

635
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:28,023
You say two. That's eight dollars
worth of play, my friends.

636
00:40:28,058 --> 00:40:30,026
- Yeah, it's eight dollars.
- Yeah.

637
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,324
Can we not disagree
on somethin'?

638
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:35,423
- We can't... We can't disagree.
- No.

639
00:40:35,466 --> 00:40:38,867
I think we reached that
place already, minutes ago.
Now here's my point.

640
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:41,234
- And you can take this to the bank.
- Yeah.

641
00:40:41,338 --> 00:40:44,739
Think for a moment
of the words "easy payments."

642
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:47,140
- Easy payments.
- Easy payments.

643
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:52,673
I'm talkin' 810 easy payments...
they're easy now... of $39.95.

644
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:55,150
- $39.95. That's not bad.
- No.

645
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:59,748
Each. That's $39.95.
This boat, your boat.

646
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:02,291
Think about it.

647
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:05,988
All we need is a signature,
and you've already got a pen.

648
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:09,497
- Yeah.
- Excuse me.

649
00:41:12,336 --> 00:41:15,305
What do you think?
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

650
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:18,637
- Yeah. It depends
on what you're thinkin'.
- Yeah, well...

651
00:41:18,709 --> 00:41:22,702
P.S. There's a 30-day
money-back guarantee.

652
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:26,146
So it's a test-drive.
You don't like it...
which you will...

653
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:28,617
you call, we come,
we pick it up.

654
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:31,017
End of story,
see you next time, no questions asked.

655
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:33,114
- That's like free rent, Gus.
- Yeah.

656
00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:36,557
You guys, if you need anything...
I mean anything...

657
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:39,721
just say out loud
the word "Phil"!

658
00:41:39,763 --> 00:41:42,732
Excuse me.

659
00:41:46,737 --> 00:41:48,671
- Hey, Phil!
- Hey, Phil!

660
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:51,731
Hey, Gus, did you ever think
we'd own a boat like this?

661
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:54,369
Oh, man, no.
Look at the navigation, Joe.

662
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:57,538
- Yeah. What's this?
- That's the three-dimensional sonar.

663
00:41:57,648 --> 00:42:00,913
- Hey, Gus, I know we gotta
bring back the knife.
- Yeah.

664
00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:03,920
But do you think we could
get a little O.F.H. in first?

665
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:07,389
Yeah, we do a little O.F.H.,
and then we take the knife back.

666
00:42:07,424 --> 00:42:09,722
Hey, Gus, look at this!

667
00:42:09,793 --> 00:42:13,786
- A hundred yards north of here.
Look at all that fish activity!
- Wow!

668
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:17,299
Hey, Joe,
they all around us, man!

669
00:42:17,401 --> 00:42:21,303
- Hey, we're surrounded by fish.
- Hey, we made it, Joe!

670
00:42:21,405 --> 00:42:26,138
Hey, you know what, Gus?
This is the first time on
this trip that life is good.

671
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,508
- Hey, a ten.
- A ten plus.

672
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:32,209
Borderline 11!

673
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:37,644
I can't wait to try out
the new "flick dip," you know?

674
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:39,814
Flick, dip.

675
00:42:49,366 --> 00:42:52,927
- What happened, Gus?
- You knocked me over with the flick.

676
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:54,971
- Gus!
- Oh, no!

677
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:02,774
- Joe, look at the fish
activity here! Whoo!

678
00:43:05,683 --> 00:43:09,676
Hey, what-what-what?

679
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:13,588
Look! Gus!

680
00:43:13,691 --> 00:43:16,182
- Let go of the pole!
- Hey, it broke!

681
00:43:16,226 --> 00:43:18,990
Get off! Get off!

682
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:21,792
What's it say, Joe? What's it say?

683
00:43:21,832 --> 00:43:24,130
- I can't find it. Ignition. Ignition.
- Huh?

684
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:26,897
Shut it down!

685
00:43:27,037 --> 00:43:30,200
Sorry.

686
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,834
Slow down!
Shut it off!

687
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:36,107
- Let me have it.
- It's broke! It's broke!

688
00:43:36,146 --> 00:43:38,512
Try shuttin' the key off, Gus.

689
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:41,813
- Shut the what off again?
- Shut the key off!

690
00:43:41,919 --> 00:43:44,149
- You broke it.
- Yeah, it broke.

691
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:48,716
Sorry!
Oh, I feel bad, Gus.

692
00:43:48,826 --> 00:43:51,556
Move out of the way!
Move out of the way!

693
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:54,325
- Sorry.
- Hey, Joe, where are we goin'?

694
00:43:54,431 --> 00:43:57,161
- Hey, J... J. P!
- Hey, it's J. P! Bubba!

695
00:43:59,737 --> 00:44:01,967
- Oh, Joe!
- Oh, Gus!

696
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:05,203
- Joe, get in! Get in!
- Gus! Gus!

697
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:16,883
Joe, the knife! Get the knife!
Get it, Joe. Get it!

698
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:19,319
- Gus! Oh!
- Get it!

699
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:23,087
- I can't get it.
- Come on, Joe. You get it?

700
00:44:23,193 --> 00:44:26,492
- Did you get it, Joe?
- No, I can't get it, Gus.

701
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:29,693
You couldn't get it, Joe?
Ohhh!

702
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:32,293
Gus, what are we gonna do?
We don't...

703
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:35,533
- I don't know, Joe.
- I can't believe it. I can't
believe we lost that knife.

704
00:44:35,606 --> 00:44:38,302
- Me either. I can't believe it.
- That was everything to us.

705
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:40,708
- Everything.
- I know. Oh, we in big trouble, Joe.

706
00:44:40,744 --> 00:44:42,712
Hey, there they are!

707
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:44,714
- Gus!
- Let's move!

708
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:47,716
Slow down!
Where are you goin'?

709
00:44:47,751 --> 00:44:50,549
- Why are they chasin' us?
- I don't know why.

710
00:44:50,654 --> 00:44:52,815
Look like they're
gainin' on us, Joe!

711
00:44:52,923 --> 00:44:56,916
Get outta here! It's not our fault!
It broke! The thing broke!

712
00:44:57,027 --> 00:45:00,360
Leave us alone!
We got enough problems!

713
00:45:00,397 --> 00:45:03,366
Watch those bushes, Gus!

714
00:45:07,004 --> 00:45:09,268
Watch out!

715
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:18,705
That's my boat!

716
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:36,426
- Hey, Phil!
- Hey, Phil!

717
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:39,594
Hey, Phil, we decided
to bring the boat back
before the 30 days was up.

718
00:45:39,703 --> 00:45:43,195
- Right, Joe?
- Yeah. Look, Phil,
this stuff all broke.

719
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:46,209
You better get it all fixed.
Thanks, anyway.

720
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:48,905
Yeah, thanks, man.
You know, you need better material.

721
00:45:49,012 --> 00:45:51,310
Yeah. Sorry.

722
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:59,651
These guys are
a two-man disaster area.

723
00:45:59,723 --> 00:46:02,851
They just bought a boat and destroyed it
in less than an hour.

724
00:46:03,994 --> 00:46:07,953
Look, these idiots
won't get very far.

725
00:46:07,998 --> 00:46:10,364
Now they've got my map.

726
00:46:10,467 --> 00:46:13,061
It might take me
another day to find them.

727
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:15,867
But I will find them.
Don't worry.

728
00:46:15,973 --> 00:46:19,704
And when I'm finished with them,
I'll know where the money is.

729
00:46:20,677 --> 00:46:24,306
We're gonna be working
every weekend for the rest
of our lives, Gus.

730
00:46:24,381 --> 00:46:26,372
How come?

731
00:46:26,483 --> 00:46:29,577
Because that boat cost
more than our house.

732
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:35,624
At least we'll
be home on time.

733
00:46:35,726 --> 00:46:38,695
Wrong.
We're gonna be home a day earlier,

734
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:41,424
and that's worse than
gettin' there on time.

735
00:46:41,498 --> 00:46:46,094
Besides, that friggin' knife
is somewhere at the bottom
of Tigertail Lagoon.

736
00:46:48,005 --> 00:46:50,405
In any case, we're goin' home.

737
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:53,505
- Flat.
- Flat.

738
00:46:55,512 --> 00:46:57,742
I got it, Gus.

739
00:47:01,185 --> 00:47:04,245
- Hey, Gus.
- What?

740
00:47:04,354 --> 00:47:07,653
- What's this?
- What's what, Joe?

741
00:47:07,758 --> 00:47:11,387
Look, look. It looks like
a map of somethin'.

742
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:17,500
Joe, it's a map
to the money and jewels.

743
00:47:17,568 --> 00:47:20,366
What jewels and money?

744
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:23,064
Joe, your memory's so bad.

745
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:26,301
Remember the $2-1/2 million
in stolen jewels and money...

746
00:47:26,376 --> 00:47:28,401
the guy on TV
said was hidden away?

747
00:47:28,478 --> 00:47:31,072
- This is it?
- Yeah. Who cares about the knife?

748
00:47:31,114 --> 00:47:35,813
We get the reward anyway.
Hey, w-we got a map
to $2-1/2 million dollars!

749
00:47:35,919 --> 00:47:39,082
- Hey, we're gonna
get the reward anyway!
- We're gonna be rich!

750
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:43,091
- We're gonna be rich...
- Wait, wait, wait, wait!

751
00:47:43,126 --> 00:47:46,789
- Gus, Gus, Gus, listen!
Gus, Gus! Listen.
- Huh? Yeah.

752
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:49,697
Listen. Who cares
about the reward is right.

753
00:47:49,733 --> 00:47:53,225
Forget about the reward. Let's
just take the 2-1/2 million
in money and jewels.

754
00:47:53,303 --> 00:47:56,204
We're millionaires!
Millionaires, Gus! We're rich!

755
00:47:56,306 --> 00:47:59,537
Joe, that guy stole that
from 43 women.

756
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:02,443
That's a whole lot
of broken hearts.

757
00:48:04,248 --> 00:48:08,651
Yeah, i-i-it's not nice.
We wouldn't like it if it
was somebody in our families.

758
00:48:08,752 --> 00:48:10,845
- We can't take it.
- But think, Joe.

759
00:48:10,954 --> 00:48:15,550
Not only is it a lot of women...
That means a lot of rewards.

760
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:17,854
It's a lot of rewards!

761
00:48:17,961 --> 00:48:21,397
- It's more than one reward.
We're rich! We're rich!
- We're gonna be rich.

762
00:48:21,465 --> 00:48:23,865
- We're gonna be rich.
- We're rich. That's right.

763
00:48:23,967 --> 00:48:26,868
Instead of one reward,
we get a bunch of rewards.

764
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:30,667
- We're really rich now.
And we're picking up...

765
00:48:30,707 --> 00:48:33,403
We're goin' fishin'!

766
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,574
- Holy smokes! Look at this place, Gus.
- Oh, yeah.

767
00:48:39,616 --> 00:48:42,710
Hey, Gus, Gus, you check us in, and I'll
give the guy the car.

768
00:48:42,819 --> 00:48:46,380
All right.
Hey, Joe, this is us. I can feel it.

769
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:49,584
Welcome to the Rod & Gun Club.
Will you be checking in, sir?

770
00:48:49,693 --> 00:48:51,991
- Yes, I am.
- Can I help you with your bags?

771
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:54,086
- I only got one bag.
- All right.

772
00:48:54,197 --> 00:48:57,428
And I'll get it myself.
It's okay. It's just an overnight bag.

773
00:48:57,501 --> 00:49:00,026
- Here's your hat, sir.
- Oh, that stays here.

774
00:49:00,137 --> 00:49:02,628
Enjoy your stay.

775
00:49:02,673 --> 00:49:05,335
Yeah. Careful
with this car.

776
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:13,648
Good evening, sir.

777
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:15,650
Hi.

778
00:49:32,769 --> 00:49:35,465
- Hey, Joe, don't... don't do that, man.
- You were scared, huh, Gus?

779
00:49:35,505 --> 00:49:39,066
It's dead.
You were scared.

780
00:49:39,109 --> 00:49:42,203
I'm sorry, gentlemen.
There are no rooms.

781
00:49:42,279 --> 00:49:46,306
The only room available
is the, uh, Presidential Suite.

782
00:49:46,383 --> 00:49:49,318
We'll take it.

783
00:49:49,419 --> 00:49:52,320
The, uh,
Presidential Suite...

784
00:49:52,389 --> 00:49:56,883
is at a rate
of $850 per evening.

785
00:49:56,994 --> 00:50:00,088
Oh, yeah, we'll, uh... So,
we'll take it per evening.

786
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:02,098
Yeah.

787
00:50:02,132 --> 00:50:05,693
Hey, Gus, this is pretty cool.
They give us rich people's
clothes to wear, huh?

788
00:50:05,736 --> 00:50:09,228
Yeah, we better get
used to it, Joe. We'll be
doing this a whole lot, man.

789
00:50:09,306 --> 00:50:12,036
Yeah.

790
00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:15,101
- Why don't I try
that pink one on, Gus?
- Yeah, yeah.

791
00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:17,442
- It might fit a little better.
- Yeah.

792
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:20,312
- 'Cause that's big.
- Yeah.

793
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:26,217
- I like the blue one better, Gus.
- Yeah, I like the pink one.
It looked better on me.

794
00:50:26,323 --> 00:50:29,156
The blue one
looks great on you.

795
00:50:32,062 --> 00:50:34,326
- Yeah, this is good.
- Yeah, it looks good.

796
00:50:34,431 --> 00:50:37,332
Yeah, this is good.
Let's go eat.

797
00:50:42,773 --> 00:50:46,368
Chicken praline.

798
00:50:46,443 --> 00:50:49,241
- Excuse us.
- Yes. Ahem. Excuse me.

799
00:50:49,346 --> 00:50:51,280
Gentlemens!

800
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:56,151
- Very nice to see you tonight.
You look very nice.
- Thank you.

801
00:50:56,253 --> 00:50:58,653
- My name is Kirk.
I am your waiter. K-I-R-K.
- Hi, Kirk.

802
00:50:58,755 --> 00:51:00,518
- I'm Joe.
- I'm Gus.

803
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:03,991
Gus. Nice to see you, Gus.
Nice to see you tonight.

804
00:51:04,094 --> 00:51:06,790
- Nice place, Joe.
- Thanks.

805
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:08,889
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

806
00:51:08,932 --> 00:51:11,423
- Excuse me, sir.
- It's good.

807
00:51:11,501 --> 00:51:13,901
Hey, look. I see
something I want already.

808
00:51:14,004 --> 00:51:16,234
- I'm gonna have the halibut.
You can have my tomatoes.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

809
00:51:16,306 --> 00:51:18,900
And I'll have
the New York strip.
You can have my vegetables.

810
00:51:18,942 --> 00:51:21,206
Gus, Gus,
I ain't takin' your vegetables,
'cause you ain't havin' steak.

811
00:51:21,311 --> 00:51:26,010
- What?
- I ain't stayin' in a room with
no zombie sleepwalking freak.

812
00:51:26,116 --> 00:51:29,552
- Hey, Joe, it's gonna be
all right. Hey-Hey, Kirk.
- Yes?

813
00:51:29,653 --> 00:51:31,712
He's gonna have halibut.
I'm gonna have the New York strip.

814
00:51:31,822 --> 00:51:34,052
- Oh, Gus, don't.
- Very nice.

815
00:51:34,124 --> 00:51:38,117
- I'll be all right, Joe.
- Okay. To drink?

816
00:51:38,228 --> 00:51:40,526
Uh, drink. Let's see.
Something special.

817
00:51:40,564 --> 00:51:43,124
Yeah, it's a special occasion.
We'll have some, some wine.

818
00:51:43,166 --> 00:51:44,827
Some wine? Yes.
Red? White?

819
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:48,837
- Something good, Kirk.
- Okay, very good.
Welcome. Welcome.

820
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:52,136
That guy gets so excited. Nice guy.

821
00:51:52,175 --> 00:51:54,769
- He makes me excited, man.
- This is great stuff.

822
00:51:54,878 --> 00:51:58,780
- This is a... borderline 11!
- Borderline 11!

823
00:51:58,849 --> 00:52:01,716
Shhh!

824
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:04,720
- What are they lookin' at?
- Yeah.

825
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:07,723
- I don't know, Rita.
I don't see anything.
- Did you find anything?

826
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:09,782
Just these.

827
00:52:09,826 --> 00:52:12,488
- Pork rinds, ugh!
- Healthy.

828
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:16,090
A bunch of fishing magazines,
some half-smoked bad cigars...

829
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:18,693
and this, uh, pen from...

830
00:52:18,735 --> 00:52:22,000
"Phil Beasly's Boat Emporium."

831
00:52:22,105 --> 00:52:25,506
Look, ladies, you gotta stop.
Okay? Party's over.

832
00:52:25,609 --> 00:52:28,407
I could lose my job.
That's it. Okay?

833
00:52:28,512 --> 00:52:31,640
Hey, that's why I gave you $20.
Now, the guy who was driving this car...

834
00:52:31,748 --> 00:52:34,216
- Where is he?
Do you know where he is?
- Rita.

835
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:37,309
- Is he your husband?
- No, he's not my...
Do you know where he is?

836
00:52:37,354 --> 00:52:40,323
Most likely, he's
in the dining room, okay?

837
00:52:40,357 --> 00:52:43,019
"Dirt road.
Chokoloske Road.

838
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:45,823
Go along the bank.
Sign for Snickerson's."

839
00:52:45,929 --> 00:52:48,056
Let me see that, Joe.

840
00:52:48,131 --> 00:52:51,032
Gentlemens,
I've gots the wine for you.

841
00:52:51,067 --> 00:52:53,627
Huh?

842
00:52:59,442 --> 00:53:02,605
Hey, that's...
What are we supposed to say, Kirk?

843
00:53:02,712 --> 00:53:06,876
You're supposed to say,
"Kirk, that looks good to me."

844
00:53:06,983 --> 00:53:09,383
Kirk, it looks good to me.

845
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:14,422
Yeah, me too, Kirk.

846
00:53:14,491 --> 00:53:17,016
It looks real good to me.
It's imported.

847
00:53:17,093 --> 00:53:19,391
- There.
- That's it?

848
00:53:19,429 --> 00:53:22,990
Kirk, I'm not exactly
a little kid, you know.
I can drink a full glass.

849
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:26,591
He gave me a little stuff like that.

850
00:53:26,636 --> 00:53:29,605
- I know. More, more.
- That's more like it.

851
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:32,539
- Give me a whole glass too, Kirk.
- Okay.

852
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:38,904
Hey, Kirk, do you know
where this is?

853
00:53:40,517 --> 00:53:44,613
Yes, that is Snickerson's.
That's about 20 miles south of here.

854
00:53:44,654 --> 00:53:49,216
- Oh, thanks.
- Okay? Okay. Okay.
Enjoy, gentlemens.

855
00:53:49,259 --> 00:53:51,420
It's 20 miles
south of here, Joe.

856
00:53:51,461 --> 00:53:53,656
That's all, man.
We're in great shape.

857
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:57,860
Huh? Hey, Gus, do you think
you should show Kirk that map?

858
00:53:57,934 --> 00:54:00,164
- He didn't know what it was.
- Ehhh.

859
00:54:00,203 --> 00:54:03,263
Maybe you're right, Joe.
We gotta be extra careful now.

860
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:13,883
- Oh, my...
- To not screwin' up, Joe.

861
00:54:13,984 --> 00:54:17,420
- To not screwin' up, Gus.
- Hey, Joe!

862
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,579
- Yeah?
- Hey, look! The girls!

863
00:54:19,689 --> 00:54:22,624
Hey, it's the girls
that gave us the ride.

864
00:54:22,692 --> 00:54:25,593
Beautiful ladies for
the very nice gentlemens.

865
00:54:25,695 --> 00:54:27,890
- Hi, Angie. Uh, thanks, Kirk.
- Hi.

866
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:30,297
- This is great.
- Sit down. Sit down.

867
00:54:30,333 --> 00:54:34,099
We didn't know what
happened to you guys.

868
00:54:34,137 --> 00:54:37,004
No, we just turned around,
and you were like gone.

869
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:40,407
- Yeah.
- You know what happened?
The boat slipped off.

870
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:44,641
- Gus tied the shambo wrong.
- I-I missed a knot.

871
00:54:44,748 --> 00:54:47,615
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

872
00:54:47,651 --> 00:54:50,313
We're celebrating
getting my car back.

873
00:54:50,353 --> 00:54:53,220
- Yeah. Yeah.
- And, uh, where's the guy?

874
00:54:53,256 --> 00:54:55,224
- The guy?
- Yeah.

875
00:54:55,258 --> 00:54:57,453
- The guy that took the car?
- Uh-huh.

876
00:54:57,527 --> 00:55:00,758
We just left him there.

877
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:06,064
Did he leave anything
in the car? You know,
like a bag or papers or...

878
00:55:06,169 --> 00:55:08,865
- A knife, knife...
- A knife?

879
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:10,906
- Yeah, but we lost the knife.
- What?

880
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:14,171
- We had a boating accident.
- Yeah.

881
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:17,475
So, like, did he leave
maybe a clue or something?

882
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:19,980
You know, where he might
be going, a tip?

883
00:55:20,016 --> 00:55:24,077
H-H-Hey, how come you girls
are so interested in this guy?

884
00:55:24,187 --> 00:55:27,088
Let's put our cards
on the table. You're
after the reward, right?

885
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:30,182
Oh, we could care less about
the reward, believe me.

886
00:55:30,226 --> 00:55:32,490
Yeah, they know about
the reward, I think.

887
00:55:32,529 --> 00:55:35,089
- 'Cause we were watching Jeopardy...
- You guys watch Jeopardy?

888
00:55:35,198 --> 00:55:37,291
Yeah. They take away Science,
I'll kill 'em.

889
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:41,097
- I'll kill 'em
if it weren't for History.
- Yeah, that's right.

890
00:55:41,204 --> 00:55:44,139
Anyway, then we put on
This Country's Criminals,
and we saw this guy.

891
00:55:44,207 --> 00:55:47,199
- And that's what you want.
You want the reward.
- Yeah.

892
00:55:47,243 --> 00:55:50,940
We just want the guy caught.
I don't care about the reward.
We don't, do we?

893
00:55:51,047 --> 00:55:54,016
- No.
- And what did he do to you?

894
00:55:54,117 --> 00:55:57,348
Look, my father,
he died almost 12 years ago.

895
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:00,287
And my mom, she's
been alone all this time...

896
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:02,587
until she met
this guy, Dekker.

897
00:56:02,659 --> 00:56:05,184
- Yeah, that's the guy.
- Yeah.

898
00:56:05,261 --> 00:56:10,460
Well, anyway, he charmed her
and then he married her...
and then he took everything.

899
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,798
Everything.

900
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:17,101
He skipped town
with her whole life savings.

901
00:56:17,173 --> 00:56:20,574
- And it broke her heart, you know?
- Yeah.

902
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:23,602
And he could have killed her
like that other woman, you know?

903
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:26,410
Hey, hey, come on.
It's okay.

904
00:56:26,516 --> 00:56:29,314
Honey, please don't cry.
It's gonna be okay, right?

905
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:31,479
The cops are gonna
take care of everything. Right, guys?

906
00:56:31,588 --> 00:56:35,524
I'm sorry. I didn't mean...
Did you have dinner?
Why don't you eat with us?

907
00:56:35,592 --> 00:56:38,026
- Join us for dinner.
- Yeah! Yeah, that's a great idea.

908
00:56:38,094 --> 00:56:40,892
Like you're really
on a vacation, right?

909
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:44,388
- Champagne.
- Champagne. Very nice.
Come on, come on, come on!

910
00:56:44,434 --> 00:56:46,902
Yeah, come on, come on,
come on, come on!

911
00:56:46,936 --> 00:56:49,734
Bubble, bubble.

912
00:57:24,874 --> 00:57:28,173
Hey, Gus?

913
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,271
Gus?

914
00:57:32,382 --> 00:57:35,374
What time is it?

915
00:57:44,694 --> 00:57:48,892
How come you're up so early?
It feels like I just went to bed.

916
00:57:55,939 --> 00:57:58,999
Hey, Gus?
Are you okay, Gus?

917
00:58:03,546 --> 00:58:07,949
Gus, you okay? Hey, Gus,
you ain't sleepwalkin', are ya?

918
00:58:09,853 --> 00:58:12,185
Uh-oh.

919
00:58:12,255 --> 00:58:16,453
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

920
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:20,953
You're sleepwalkin', Gus.
Gus, you're sleepwalkin'.

921
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:23,295
Gus, you are!

922
00:58:25,568 --> 00:58:28,765
I need water.

923
00:58:28,872 --> 00:58:32,069
- Gus, I need water!
- All right, Tommy, I'm on my way.

924
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:48,885
Gus, you ain't never
eatin' meat again!

925
00:58:48,925 --> 00:58:52,417
No more steak, ever!
That's it!

926
00:58:57,834 --> 00:59:00,029
The phone. Hello?

927
00:59:00,069 --> 00:59:03,038
I have received a report
of some noise.

928
00:59:03,139 --> 00:59:06,336
Where, in this room?
Uh, no way. No way.

929
00:59:08,578 --> 00:59:11,547
- I-I'll call you back.
- I'm leaving, Cookie.

930
00:59:11,648 --> 00:59:14,742
- I gotta go. Gus! Gus!
- See you tonight.

931
00:59:14,851 --> 00:59:16,546
Hello?

932
00:59:17,654 --> 00:59:20,589
Whooaahh!

933
00:59:24,494 --> 00:59:29,557
Gus! Gus!

934
00:59:33,703 --> 00:59:36,365
Gus! Gus!

935
00:59:38,308 --> 00:59:41,709
Hello?

936
00:59:41,811 --> 00:59:45,269
- Gus! Gus!
- Is everything all right?

937
00:59:45,381 --> 00:59:48,009
Gus, will you wake...
Gus!

938
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:50,382
Gus! Gus!
Wake up, Gus!

939
00:59:51,888 --> 00:59:53,981
Hello?

940
00:59:56,392 --> 00:59:59,919
- Gus!
- Joe! Joe, what are you doin'?

941
00:59:59,996 --> 01:00:02,794
You're sleepwalkin' again, you jerk!

942
01:00:02,832 --> 01:00:04,424
- Gus, our room!
- What?

943
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:06,695
- That's our room!
- What?

944
01:00:06,736 --> 01:00:08,931
- The map, Gus.
- What?

945
01:00:09,005 --> 01:00:13,305
That's our room on fire.
It's our room. It's our room!

946
01:00:13,409 --> 01:00:16,344
The map is gone and everything.
You were sleepwalking!

947
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:18,607
How did you know I was sleepwalking?

948
01:00:18,715 --> 01:00:21,513
- You weren't fishing.
You were sleepwalking.
- Hey, hey, hey!

949
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:24,212
Hey, valet!
We gotta get outta here.

950
01:00:24,253 --> 01:00:28,212
- Get our car for us.
- A blue Barracuda, ' 68 Plymouth.

951
01:00:28,257 --> 01:00:29,815
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Hurry up!

952
01:00:29,859 --> 01:00:32,020
- Go, go, go, go.
- Don't worry about the fire.

953
01:00:32,061 --> 01:00:33,824
- They'll fix it.
- Yeah.

954
01:00:33,863 --> 01:00:36,525
- What are you doing?
- Leave the girls a note.

955
01:00:36,566 --> 01:00:40,730
Yeah, okay, that's good.
Tell them we're gonna meet 'em
at Snickerson's Landing.

956
01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:43,136
- How many K's in Snickerson's?
- Just one, Joe.

957
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:46,265
- Yeah, yeah.
- There's a shack around
there too, right?

958
01:00:46,376 --> 01:00:49,243
- Yeah. Yeah.
- They should know about the shack.

959
01:00:49,345 --> 01:00:54,248
- Give this note to the girls
in the El Camino, remember?

960
01:00:54,283 --> 01:00:57,446
- Rita and Angie. I'll give you
a big tip when I come back.
- Come on, Joe!

961
01:00:57,553 --> 01:00:59,453
- Okay, I'm coming.
- You're leaving 'em again?

962
01:00:59,555 --> 01:01:02,991
Yeah. Hey, excuse me.

963
01:01:09,799 --> 01:01:12,996
Joe, all that starin'
at the map before dinner...

964
01:01:13,102 --> 01:01:15,127
and all you remember
is Snickerson's?

965
01:01:15,204 --> 01:01:17,399
Hey, Gus, it was
a complicated map.

966
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:19,601
Your memory's so bad
it's amazing.

967
01:01:19,642 --> 01:01:22,634
I'll tell you what's amazing,
Gus. I-It's how you walk around
while you're sleepin'.

968
01:01:22,745 --> 01:01:25,805
- That's amazing.
- Well, just try to remember
the map, okay?

969
01:01:25,915 --> 01:01:28,406
I'm sorry if I don't have
a photographic memory, Gus.

970
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:31,112
- You don't even have a memory.
- You wanna talk about memories?

971
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:34,451
Do you recall settin'
a hotel room on fire?

972
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:39,325
For Rita and her mother,
just try to remember the map.
Okay? Think.

973
01:01:41,431 --> 01:01:45,265
- Well, what?
- I'm tryin'.

974
01:01:45,334 --> 01:01:47,825
- Give me a chance.
- Okay.

975
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:50,338
I can't remember nothing.
Let's just go home.

976
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:52,967
No, we're gonna find
the money.

977
01:01:53,076 --> 01:01:56,045
No, I'll tell you
where we're going. We are going...

978
01:01:56,145 --> 01:02:00,411
Nowhere.

979
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:41,917
It could be worse, Joe.

980
01:02:42,024 --> 01:02:45,118
- What?
- It could be worse.

981
01:02:45,161 --> 01:02:48,255
Hey, Gus, please don't say that, okay?
'Cause it can't get any worse.

982
01:02:48,331 --> 01:02:52,631
I mean, I'm so sick of,
like, every time that we...
we get in trouble,

983
01:02:52,735 --> 01:02:56,535
if something goes bad, we think
of, like, worse situations
just so we could say,

984
01:02:56,639 --> 01:02:59,039
"You know, this ain't so bad.
It could be a lot worse."

985
01:02:59,075 --> 01:03:02,272
- All I said...
- Hey, Gus, the truth is,
it can't get any worse.

986
01:03:10,019 --> 01:03:12,988
Hey, Joe!

987
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:19,887
Joe?

988
01:03:19,929 --> 01:03:21,897
Hey, Joe?

989
01:03:21,931 --> 01:03:24,092
I-It just got worse, Gus.

990
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:26,794
- What?
- You saw the lightning.
You know what happens.

991
01:03:26,836 --> 01:03:29,634
Joe, what are the chances
of you gettin' hit
by lightning again?

992
01:03:29,705 --> 01:03:32,503
Hey, Gus, what were the odds
the first time I got hit?

993
01:03:32,542 --> 01:03:35,443
And what about the odds
the second time I got hit?

994
01:03:35,511 --> 01:03:39,811
Hey, Joe, if I could fix the car,
I'd do it myself.

995
01:03:39,916 --> 01:03:43,716
Besides, that's the worst
place you could be is behind a tree.

996
01:03:45,521 --> 01:03:50,220
Yeah, you see?
I mean, I can't... I can't
fix the Barracuda, man.

997
01:03:50,259 --> 01:03:53,922
So let's just fix the Barracuda
and go find the money, all right?

998
01:03:53,963 --> 01:03:56,158
Hey, come on, here.

999
01:03:58,434 --> 01:04:01,460
I me... Oh, come on, Joe,
don't be silly.

1000
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:04,166
Hey, Gus, I'm trying to be intelligent
about this, you know?

1001
01:04:04,207 --> 01:04:05,333
What do you mean, intelligent?
You're being silly, man.
Nothing's gonna happen!

1002
01:04:05,374 --> 01:04:08,366
What do you mean, intelligent?
You're being silly, man.
Nothing's gonna happen!

1003
01:04:08,411 --> 01:04:11,903
Hey, Gus, it hurts
to get hit by lightning. You
don't know what it feels like.

1004
01:04:11,981 --> 01:04:14,074
Hey, Joe, watch. Uh, look.

1005
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:18,779
Hey... hit me!
See?

1006
01:04:18,888 --> 01:04:23,291
Hit me! You see?

1007
01:04:23,392 --> 01:04:26,225
Right here. See?

1008
01:04:26,295 --> 01:04:28,889
See what I mean?
Hey, here I am!

1009
01:04:28,998 --> 01:04:32,991
You got a free shot!
Take it! Right here! Hit me!

1010
01:04:33,102 --> 01:04:35,900
See wha...
See what I mean, Joe?

1011
01:04:35,938 --> 01:04:38,202
Yeah, it's a little silly.

1012
01:04:38,307 --> 01:04:40,798
Here, here, here.
Let's go fix the car.

1013
01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:43,708
There. See?

1014
01:04:48,317 --> 01:04:50,251
Here.

1015
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:52,753
Whoo. Whoo!

1016
01:04:52,822 --> 01:04:56,258
Uh-huh.

1017
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:06,396
Hey, Joe!

1018
01:05:09,272 --> 01:05:14,209
Joe! Joe?
Joe, talk to me. Joe, talk to me.

1019
01:05:14,277 --> 01:05:18,270
Joe, I-I didn't mean
to talk you into doin' it, Joe.

1020
01:05:18,314 --> 01:05:22,182
I should've listened to you!
I said nothing's gonna happen,
and it happened.

1021
01:05:22,285 --> 01:05:27,689
A-A-All the little guy
wanted to do was go fishin'.

1022
01:05:27,790 --> 01:05:31,920
Is that askin' too much?
Ain't nothin' wrong
with that, is there?

1023
01:05:31,994 --> 01:05:34,326
Oh, he's a...
he's a good guy.

1024
01:05:34,397 --> 01:05:37,389
I mean, he's a good guy.
The best.

1025
01:05:37,433 --> 01:05:40,095
Joe, we all love ya.

1026
01:05:51,847 --> 01:05:53,815
Joe, Joe, Joe.

1027
01:05:53,849 --> 01:05:57,410
Hey, Gus,
I remember the map.

1028
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:59,454
Snickerson's Airboat Rentals.

1029
01:05:59,555 --> 01:06:02,251
Left, right, right,
left, left, right, right.

1030
01:06:02,358 --> 01:06:06,590
Channel number 27,
11 paces to the big tree
underneath the water nest.

1031
01:06:06,662 --> 01:06:09,654
That's where the treasure lies,
where Mad Maggie rests.

1032
01:06:09,765 --> 01:06:12,700
- Hey, we're gonna be rich!
- We're gonna be rich!

1033
01:06:12,768 --> 01:06:15,896
We're gonna be rich.
We're gonna be rich.

1034
01:06:23,379 --> 01:06:26,075
He was not there, and
they don't want to talk to me.

1035
01:06:26,115 --> 01:06:29,380
- What happened here?
- A fire.

1036
01:06:29,485 --> 01:06:31,976
I can see it was a fire.
How did it start?

1037
01:06:32,088 --> 01:06:36,184
- Two guys from up north
blew up their room.
- You don't say?

1038
01:06:36,292 --> 01:06:40,194
One tall, one short,
in a blue car?

1039
01:06:40,296 --> 01:06:44,790
Yes. Yeah. I, uh...

1040
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:50,431
I wait on the tables
for the tall and the small one.

1041
01:06:50,506 --> 01:06:53,339
They say
where they were going?

1042
01:06:53,409 --> 01:06:58,039
The tall one,
he come to me and he said...

1043
01:06:58,114 --> 01:07:00,878
He showed me a map,

1044
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:04,044
and he want to know
where was Snickerson's.

1045
01:07:04,153 --> 01:07:06,383
- Airboats. Gotcha.
- So I... So I...

1046
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:11,588
If you see them,
you tell them...

1047
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:14,788
that I love them very much
and I want to see them again...

1048
01:07:14,864 --> 01:07:18,800
- and that they're very nice,
very attractive boys.

1049
01:07:20,669 --> 01:07:22,967
You sure we're going the right way?

1050
01:07:23,005 --> 01:07:26,964
Yeah, there's the arch, Gus.
We gotta go under that arch
and turn right, Gus.

1051
01:07:27,009 --> 01:07:30,570
- We should be able to see the
island once we get past this.
- Oh, yeah?

1052
01:07:30,613 --> 01:07:34,379
- What's the next landmark?
- We gotta go right,
and then there's twin trees.

1053
01:07:34,483 --> 01:07:36,075
I can't wait
to get there.

1054
01:07:36,185 --> 01:07:37,880
- Sure scary in here, Gus.
- Yeah.

1055
01:07:37,987 --> 01:07:41,081
- What's that?
That's a log over there?
- That's only a log.

1056
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:45,388
- Oh, okay. Here.
- It's only a log.

1057
01:07:45,494 --> 01:07:48,520
- We goin' through the arch?
- Go through this arch, then go right.

1058
01:07:48,597 --> 01:07:51,532
Straight through there, Gus.
That's it!

1059
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:54,330
- Straight, Gus.
- We're on our way, Joe.

1060
01:07:54,403 --> 01:07:57,236
It's a lot of work,
but it's gonna be worth it, Gus.

1061
01:07:57,306 --> 01:07:59,536
I-It's the palm tree
with nothin' on it.

1062
01:07:59,608 --> 01:08:03,135
We make a left here
and then there's a tree
with a flower on it, Gus.

1063
01:08:03,245 --> 01:08:07,181
That's it. Hey, look!
There's a tree with a flower
on it. That's it.

1064
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:09,274
- That's a pretty flower.
- That's it.

1065
01:08:09,385 --> 01:08:13,344
And there's the cave, Gus.
It just said watch out for Mad Maggie.

1066
01:08:13,389 --> 01:08:15,357
Who's Mad Maggie?

1067
01:08:15,391 --> 01:08:19,054
It was just something
on the map, probably
to keep people away.

1068
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:23,464
Mad Maggie.
Keep them away, yeah.

1069
01:08:23,499 --> 01:08:26,832
- Come on, Gus.
- All right.

1070
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:30,600
We're gonna be rich.

1071
01:08:35,511 --> 01:08:36,773
That's the cave, huh?

1072
01:08:36,846 --> 01:08:38,609
- That's it, Gus.
- Yeah.

1073
01:08:38,681 --> 01:08:41,980
- I remembered everything.
I can't believe it.
- Well, this is the cave.

1074
01:08:42,017 --> 01:08:45,475
- The cave is inside.
This is the hole, though.
- This is the hole, that's right.

1075
01:08:45,521 --> 01:08:49,082
- Yeah. It's kind of dark
in there, Joe.
- I got a light for you, Gus.

1076
01:08:49,191 --> 01:08:52,490
- For me?
- Well, I figured you
should go in first, Gus.

1077
01:08:52,595 --> 01:08:55,587
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Because I know I can fit in this hole,

1078
01:08:55,698 --> 01:08:58,531
- but we want to make sure
you get in here.
- Yeah, that's right.

1079
01:08:58,601 --> 01:09:01,434
- Right?
- You're not scared, are you, Joe?

1080
01:09:01,537 --> 01:09:04,734
- No. Hey, Gus, I'll go.
- Oh, no, that's all right.
I know you're not.

1081
01:09:04,773 --> 01:09:06,741
- 'Cause I'm not scared, Gus.
- Okay. You just watch out.

1082
01:09:06,775 --> 01:09:08,538
- I just want to get the money.
- Yeah, okay.

1083
01:09:08,644 --> 01:09:10,839
- All right?
- The jewels are right in there.

1084
01:09:10,946 --> 01:09:13,437
- I wonder what this
Mad Maggie stuff is about.
- What?

1085
01:09:13,482 --> 01:09:15,450
Nothing, nothing. Okay.

1086
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:18,544
- Easy now.
- Here it... How's that, Gus?

1087
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:20,554
Yeah.

1088
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:27,493
It's hard to see.
Joe, over here in front of me.

1089
01:09:27,563 --> 01:09:31,897
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, my eyesight gets bad
when I get in close places.

1090
01:09:34,770 --> 01:09:37,603
- What you see?
- I don't see nothing, Gus.

1091
01:09:37,673 --> 01:09:40,665
- It stinks in here, doesn't it?
- It ain't me.

1092
01:09:40,776 --> 01:09:43,176
It smells
like rotten meat.

1093
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:47,274
Hey, Gus. There's
something back there, Gus.

1094
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:49,579
- Look at this. See that?
- Yeah, I see it.

1095
01:09:49,685 --> 01:09:51,915
- I-It's a case.
- Yeah.

1096
01:09:52,021 --> 01:09:54,581
This is it.
Hold this, Gus.

1097
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:57,181
You got it?

1098
01:09:57,226 --> 01:09:59,694
- Oh, be careful.
- I got it.

1099
01:09:59,728 --> 01:10:02,526
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1100
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:13,201
- Holy smokes!
- That's it, Joe!

1101
01:10:13,309 --> 01:10:16,506
- Holy smokes!
Hey, we're gonna be rich, Gus.
- Yeah.

1102
01:10:16,545 --> 01:10:19,139
- We get 100,000, right?
- We get $100,000,Joe.

1103
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:22,241
Let's get it outta here.
We're gonna be rich.

1104
01:10:22,351 --> 01:10:25,616
We did it, Gus. We did it.

1105
01:10:25,721 --> 01:10:29,157
- What are you shushing me for?
- I didn't shush you, Joe.
Come on. Let's go.

1106
01:10:29,258 --> 01:10:31,726
- You didn't shush me?
- No, I didn't shush you.

1107
01:10:37,833 --> 01:10:41,428
Mad Maggie!

1108
01:10:45,341 --> 01:10:48,538
Let go of it!

1109
01:10:48,577 --> 01:10:51,137
Watch it, Gus! Gus!
What the heck are you doin'?

1110
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:53,478
I can get it, Joe.
I can get it.

1111
01:10:53,549 --> 01:10:56,643
- Gus, what are you doing?
Are you crazy?
- H-Hey, pull!

1112
01:10:56,752 --> 01:10:58,913
Get it out!
Pull harder, Joe!

1113
01:10:59,054 --> 01:11:01,488
You're crazy, Gus!

1114
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:04,491
I got it, Joe!

1115
01:11:04,593 --> 01:11:08,029
What do I do now, Joe?

1116
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:10,588
Hey, Gus, be careful!
Let it go.

1117
01:11:10,633 --> 01:11:12,726
Spin him around, Gus.
I'll kick him in the nuts.

1118
01:11:12,801 --> 01:11:16,100
He's a she, Joe.
She ain't got no nuts.

1119
01:11:17,606 --> 01:11:20,700
Get her, Joe, get her!
Harder, harder, Joe, harder!

1120
01:11:23,846 --> 01:11:27,043
- Come on, Gus!
- Let's get outta here.

1121
01:11:29,018 --> 01:11:31,816
- Holy smokes! Look at that, Gus.
- We did it, Joe.

1122
01:11:31,887 --> 01:11:33,821
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1123
01:11:33,889 --> 01:11:35,948
You know, Gus, there's a lot
of family heirlooms here.

1124
01:11:36,025 --> 01:11:37,959
Those poor people.
That's not nice.

1125
01:11:38,027 --> 01:11:40,120
- Yeah, a lot of "hairlooms"
in there, yeah.
- Yeah.

1126
01:11:40,229 --> 01:11:42,129
W-We're gonna get
reward money, anyway.

1127
01:11:42,231 --> 01:11:43,858
- We're gonna be rich.
- Yeah, and famous.

1128
01:11:43,932 --> 01:11:45,957
Oh, really?

1129
01:11:46,035 --> 01:11:48,833
- Now, move!
- Yeah.

1130
01:11:48,871 --> 01:11:51,396
- Move!
- Okay, I'm movin'. I'm movin'.

1131
01:11:51,473 --> 01:11:54,169
I'm moving.

1132
01:11:54,243 --> 01:11:56,438
- What's he doing, Joe?
- I don't know, Gus.

1133
01:11:56,545 --> 01:12:01,073
Rugby-playing jerk.
I'd like to get him on a football team.

1134
01:12:02,718 --> 01:12:05,278
- Now push.
- What? What?

1135
01:12:05,354 --> 01:12:09,290
- Just push the car!
- Hey!

1136
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:14,092
I've wasted a lot of time
looking for you two.
Now, you do what I say.

1137
01:12:14,129 --> 01:12:17,792
Gus, it's all right, Gus.
It's all right. Don't...
Don't get in trouble, Gus.

1138
01:12:17,866 --> 01:12:20,300
- Bet he can't play no football.
- Push the car!

1139
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:22,327
- I just can't.
- Push the car!

1140
01:12:22,404 --> 01:12:26,033
- He said he's gonna push!
- Do you want me to put
a bullet through his head?

1141
01:12:26,108 --> 01:12:28,099
- No, he's gonna push.
- Do it now.

1142
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:29,905
- Push, Joe.
- Gus, I can't.

1143
01:12:30,012 --> 01:12:31,502
- I know.
- He scared me.

1144
01:12:31,613 --> 01:12:34,707
I know, Joe.
It's tough, man. It's tough.

1145
01:12:34,817 --> 01:12:37,149
- Oh, Gus.
- It's tough.

1146
01:12:43,525 --> 01:12:45,459
My car, Gus.

1147
01:12:45,527 --> 01:12:48,018
You'll get
another one, Joe.

1148
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:13,177
You two wouldn't understand.
I really deserve that money.

1149
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:18,182
I made those women feel
like somebody really
loved them, you know?

1150
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:23,096
Believe me, it wasn't easy.
I deserve every penny.

1151
01:13:25,801 --> 01:13:28,099
So you just sit there...

1152
01:13:28,137 --> 01:13:32,403
and think about me
going off to a life
of wealth and luxury...

1153
01:13:32,441 --> 01:13:36,138
while you've only got your
dreary little poverty-stricken
lives to go back to.

1154
01:13:40,215 --> 01:13:43,707
But I'm sure you'll enjoy
spending Thanksgiving
here together.

1155
01:13:43,819 --> 01:13:47,812
Oh, what? Have I ruined your plans
for the holidays?

1156
01:13:47,856 --> 01:13:50,552
Oh, I am so sorry.

1157
01:13:52,561 --> 01:13:54,756
You think you're so big.

1158
01:13:54,830 --> 01:13:57,628
A big tough guy
picking on women.

1159
01:13:57,733 --> 01:13:59,633
- You go rob women.
- Hey, Joe.

1160
01:13:59,735 --> 01:14:01,669
Beat up on them
and kill them and stuff.

1161
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:04,898
- Shut up, Joe.
- I'm not scared of him, Gus.

1162
01:14:04,973 --> 01:14:07,669
It's who he is.
You want to fight everybody.

1163
01:14:07,709 --> 01:14:10,177
Why don't you join the army
if you want to fight?

1164
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:12,372
Go join the Marines,
fight with them.
See how tough you are.

1165
01:14:12,481 --> 01:14:16,918
- Hey, Joe, don't make him mad.
- He made us push my car
in that swamp.

1166
01:14:17,019 --> 01:14:20,216
Thanks a lot,
creep, creep, creep, creep.

1167
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:22,814
- You're a creep. Creep, creep.
- Yeah. Joe!

1168
01:14:22,891 --> 01:14:25,587
Creep, creep...

1169
01:14:25,694 --> 01:14:28,891
J-J-Joe! Tell him you're sorry, Joe.
H-H-He didn't mean it.

1170
01:14:28,931 --> 01:14:31,798
Don't hurt him.
Joe, tell him you're sorry.
You're hurting him.

1171
01:14:31,834 --> 01:14:34,132
Tell him you didn't mean it, Joe.
You're hurting him.

1172
01:14:34,203 --> 01:14:37,400
He's sorry. He said he's sorry.

1173
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:41,535
- Joe! You're gonna kill him!
Joe! Don't kill him!

1174
01:14:41,610 --> 01:14:46,604
- Joe.
- You know, for an insignificant,
ignorant little man...

1175
01:14:46,648 --> 01:14:49,617
you've got
a really big mouth.

1176
01:14:49,718 --> 01:14:51,811
Now shut it.

1177
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:54,013
You all right, Joe?

1178
01:14:54,122 --> 01:14:56,750
Joe, I hate that guy.

1179
01:14:56,825 --> 01:15:00,056
I'd love to stay
and chat with you, but, uh,

1180
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:02,596
I've got a plane to catch.

1181
01:15:09,271 --> 01:15:12,763
You know, you two should
really grow up. You've got
children of your own, you know?

1182
01:15:12,808 --> 01:15:16,471
Now that is
a really scary thought.

1183
01:15:23,619 --> 01:15:26,486
I could kill you now,
but it's not worth it.

1184
01:15:26,588 --> 01:15:30,388
The alligators
will probably get you.

1185
01:15:44,907 --> 01:15:47,603
- Big tough guy when we're
tied up, huh, Gus?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1186
01:15:47,643 --> 01:15:49,941
- When we can't do nothing.
- I know.

1187
01:15:50,045 --> 01:15:53,105
- Lucky we were tied, right, Gus?
- Yeah, it's lucky we were tied.

1188
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:55,445
What's wrong with us
anyway, Gus?

1189
01:15:55,517 --> 01:15:58,213
W-We work hard.
We've got great families...

1190
01:15:58,320 --> 01:15:59,947
and kids
and beautiful wives.

1191
01:15:59,988 --> 01:16:02,752
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- We work hard. We go to church.

1192
01:16:02,791 --> 01:16:05,760
- All we like to do is fish.
We don't bother nobody.
- Yeah, we're lucky, Joe.

1193
01:16:05,794 --> 01:16:08,661
- Why does everything
go wrong around us?
- 'Cause we're lucky, Joe.

1194
01:16:08,697 --> 01:16:12,360
- We're lucky?
- Yeah, you said it all, Joe.

1195
01:16:12,467 --> 01:16:15,664
We got great families.
We got kids. Our wives love us.

1196
01:16:15,771 --> 01:16:18,171
You know?
We go to church. We work hard.

1197
01:16:18,273 --> 01:16:20,605
- All we do is want to go fishin'.
- Yeah.

1198
01:16:20,676 --> 01:16:21,973
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1199
01:16:22,077 --> 01:16:24,011
- Yeah.
- I never thought of it like that.

1200
01:16:24,079 --> 01:16:26,013
- Yeah, but that's...
- We are lucky, huh, Gus?

1201
01:16:26,081 --> 01:16:28,015
- We're lucky. We're lucky.
- Yeah.

1202
01:16:28,083 --> 01:16:30,017
We can't help it if everything
goes wrong around us.

1203
01:16:30,085 --> 01:16:32,019
- Yeah. Yeah, it ain't our fault.
- Yeah.

1204
01:16:32,087 --> 01:16:35,716
Yeah.

1205
01:16:35,791 --> 01:16:38,282
- Hey, Gus, do you think
he's coming back?
- No.

1206
01:16:38,327 --> 01:16:40,693
It sounds like somebody's
gonna rescue us, Joe.

1207
01:16:40,796 --> 01:16:45,096
- Hey, you remember
that movie Deliverance?

1208
01:16:45,133 --> 01:16:47,397
Sounds like those guys.

1209
01:16:48,604 --> 01:16:51,334
I don't wanna squeal
like a pig.

1210
01:16:51,406 --> 01:16:54,000
- I don't wanna squeal
like a pig, either.

1211
01:16:55,911 --> 01:16:58,243
- Hey!
- Gus!

1212
01:17:09,658 --> 01:17:11,888
You know who
I think it is, Gus?

1213
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:14,053
Yeah, it's
Catch Pooler, Joe.

1214
01:17:14,096 --> 01:17:16,064
It's him.
I can't believe it.

1215
01:17:16,164 --> 01:17:18,064
- Oh, it's Catch Pooler.
- Yeah, that's Catch.

1216
01:17:18,166 --> 01:17:19,895
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Hey, Catch.

1217
01:17:19,968 --> 01:17:21,765
Catch, yeah.

1218
01:17:21,870 --> 01:17:24,065
- I saw that guy bring ya in.
- Yeah.

1219
01:17:24,106 --> 01:17:26,074
Are you all right?

1220
01:17:26,108 --> 01:17:29,077
- See that, Gus?
- Yeah, I saw it.

1221
01:17:29,111 --> 01:17:32,774
- He untied a triple shambo
with one hand.
- One hand. That's Catch.

1222
01:17:32,881 --> 01:17:34,781
- You know that's Catch.
- I know that's Catch.

1223
01:17:34,883 --> 01:17:37,181
- You know that's Catch.
Hey, Catch, Joe Waters.
- Joe.

1224
01:17:37,219 --> 01:17:39,187
- I'm Gus Green.
- Gus.

1225
01:17:39,221 --> 01:17:42,088
We won your contest, you know?
"Why you want to fish
in the Everglades?"

1226
01:17:42,124 --> 01:17:44,684
Yes, sir, I know that.

1227
01:17:44,726 --> 01:17:47,695
- He knows.
- But remember...

1228
01:17:47,729 --> 01:17:50,425
- Yeah?
- don't ever forget:

1229
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:54,833
The canary sings,
but the eagle flies.

1230
01:17:56,938 --> 01:17:59,202
- The canary sings.
- The canary sings.

1231
01:17:59,241 --> 01:18:01,937
- The eagle flies.
- The eagle flies.

1232
01:18:02,044 --> 01:18:05,536
- Hmm, there must be
some hidden meaning there, Gus.
- Yeah, that's...

1233
01:18:05,647 --> 01:18:07,581
- Right?
- Yeah.

1234
01:18:27,769 --> 01:18:29,703
Hey, Catch,
see my car over there?

1235
01:18:29,771 --> 01:18:31,705
- Yeah.
- This guy's so mean.

1236
01:18:31,773 --> 01:18:35,607
He made us push my car
in the water. We really
wanna get this guy.

1237
01:18:35,677 --> 01:18:38,578
- He said he's gonna take a plane.
He's gotta catch a plane.
- Yeah.

1238
01:18:38,613 --> 01:18:41,104
Well, there's no airport
around here for miles.

1239
01:18:41,183 --> 01:18:43,981
- There's not?
- We don't know what to do.

1240
01:18:44,019 --> 01:18:46,078
Hey, Catch,
we gotta catch him.

1241
01:18:46,121 --> 01:18:48,487
- We don't hate nobody, Catch.
- No.

1242
01:18:48,523 --> 01:18:50,218
- This guy's real mean.
- Yeah.

1243
01:18:50,292 --> 01:18:52,089
- He took money and jewels
from old women.
- Yeah.

1244
01:18:52,127 --> 01:18:53,890
- And he killed one!
- He killed one.

1245
01:18:53,995 --> 01:18:55,895
- Catch, he tried to kill me and Joe!
- He tried to kill us.

1246
01:18:55,997 --> 01:18:58,830
- Yeah.
- We really... We really
want this guy, Catch.

1247
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:00,959
- Yeah.
- You will catch him, Joe.

1248
01:19:01,069 --> 01:19:04,038
- We will?
- Gus, you will catch him.

1249
01:19:04,139 --> 01:19:08,041
- We will?
- Remember... the hands.

1250
01:19:08,076 --> 01:19:10,044
- The hands.
- The hands.

1251
01:19:10,145 --> 01:19:11,635
It's in the hands.

1252
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:13,841
- It's in the hands.
- It's in the hands.

1253
01:19:13,949 --> 01:19:15,883
And be the one
you want to catch.

1254
01:19:15,951 --> 01:19:18,943
- Be the one you wanna catch.
- Be the one you wanna catch.

1255
01:19:18,987 --> 01:19:22,946
And flick... and dip.

1256
01:19:23,058 --> 01:19:26,789
- And flick and dip.
- And flick and dip.

1257
01:19:26,862 --> 01:19:30,696
- And flick and dip.
- And flick and dip.

1258
01:19:30,799 --> 01:19:34,064
- And flick and dip.
- And flick and dip.

1259
01:19:34,169 --> 01:19:38,868
- Flick and dip.
- Flick and dip.

1260
01:19:38,907 --> 01:19:41,808
- And flick and dip.
- And flick and dip.

1261
01:19:41,877 --> 01:19:44,505
- And flick and...
- And flick and...

1262
01:19:44,579 --> 01:19:49,073
He-Hey, Gus, he's gone!
Hey, Catch!

1263
01:19:49,184 --> 01:19:51,880
- So long, Catch!
- Catch!

1264
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:54,388
- What a guy, huh?
- Oh, C-Catch.

1265
01:19:54,422 --> 01:19:56,720
Gus, what are we gonna do?
He said there's no airport around here.

1266
01:19:56,792 --> 01:19:58,885
- How are we gonna catch this guy?
- Yeah.

1267
01:20:01,429 --> 01:20:04,398
- A seaplane!
- A seaplane!

1268
01:20:04,499 --> 01:20:06,626
- He knew!
- He knew!

1269
01:20:06,735 --> 01:20:08,896
- Hey, Gus! Help me
get the airboat, Gus!
- Hey... He-Hey!

1270
01:20:09,004 --> 01:20:11,996
- We gotta follow that plane.
- Hey, Joe, h-h-how do you know
that's a seaplane?

1271
01:20:12,107 --> 01:20:14,507
That's it! It's gotta be!

1272
01:20:14,609 --> 01:20:17,601
- Joe, what are you doing?
- We'll take this boat.
We'll follow the plane.

1273
01:20:17,646 --> 01:20:21,138
- Gus, we'll get that guy.
- J-Joe, we don't even know
if that was the plane.

1274
01:20:21,216 --> 01:20:24,743
It's a seaplane! Come on,
Gus, you know he was right.
That's the plane!

1275
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:27,015
- We'll follow it.
- Yeah, I know he knew.
I know he knew! I know that!

1276
01:20:27,055 --> 01:20:29,717
- So, let's go!
- Joe, we can't even drive the boat.

1277
01:20:29,758 --> 01:20:32,625
- I'll drive it, Gus.
- Oh, Joe!

1278
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:36,757
Gus, this guy wrecked our boat.
Look what he did to my car!

1279
01:20:36,865 --> 01:20:40,562
Hey, Gus, he tried to kill us.
He embarrassed me, Gus.

1280
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:45,333
I don't know about you,
but he made me cry. I don't
feel much like a man, Gus.

1281
01:20:45,373 --> 01:20:47,933
I thought you would
want to help me.

1282
01:20:48,043 --> 01:20:49,977
Okay for you, Gus.

1283
01:20:50,045 --> 01:20:53,242
Oh! Come on, Joe, I'll drive.

1284
01:21:06,094 --> 01:21:08,688
Whoa!

1285
01:21:23,211 --> 01:21:26,044
Hey, look!
I got the hang of it.

1286
01:21:49,371 --> 01:21:52,966
- I got it! I got it!
- You got it now.

1287
01:21:55,277 --> 01:21:58,769
Gus, look!
There he is! Look!

1288
01:21:58,847 --> 01:22:01,975
We got him now, Joe!

1289
01:22:10,091 --> 01:22:12,491
Hey, you wanna drive?

1290
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:29,206
We got you, creep!

1291
01:22:29,244 --> 01:22:31,610
No matter which side,
we're gonna get ya.

1292
01:22:31,713 --> 01:22:34,944
Gonna get you now!
Gonna get ya!

1293
01:22:35,016 --> 01:22:36,813
Whoa!

1294
01:22:37,919 --> 01:22:40,319
Watch out!

1295
01:22:53,435 --> 01:22:55,960
I'll get us
out of this, Joe!

1296
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:00,972
- What does this look like to you?
- Swigging bones.

1297
01:23:01,076 --> 01:23:03,806
- No, "S."
- Swigging bones. What's that?

1298
01:23:03,878 --> 01:23:06,210
There they are!
The girls!

1299
01:23:06,281 --> 01:23:08,408
The girls, Gus. Hey,
I don't think they saw us.

1300
01:23:08,483 --> 01:23:12,283
Hey, we're chasing Dekker!

1301
01:23:17,892 --> 01:23:20,087
- H-H-Hey, Joe!
- What's he doing?

1302
01:23:20,128 --> 01:23:22,596
Drive across!

1303
01:23:46,755 --> 01:23:49,724
- Faster, Gus!
- I'm goin' as fast as I can!
You wanna drive?

1304
01:23:49,758 --> 01:23:52,556
- Give me that! I'll drive!
- No, let me drive!

1305
01:23:58,333 --> 01:24:00,597
- We gotta go around him, Gus!
- I know, I know!

1306
01:24:00,668 --> 01:24:03,967
- Faster. On the left!
- See, I'm going faster, Joe!

1307
01:24:25,293 --> 01:24:27,591
Around, Gus!

1308
01:24:54,355 --> 01:24:56,915
He's gettin' away!
He's gettin' away!

1309
01:25:03,498 --> 01:25:08,060
Grab the pole, Joe!
Remember: flick, dip.

1310
01:25:08,169 --> 01:25:10,501
Right.

1311
01:25:13,975 --> 01:25:17,376
- I got him, Gus!
- Whooo!

1312
01:25:17,479 --> 01:25:19,379
- I got him, Gus!
- You got him!

1313
01:25:19,481 --> 01:25:21,779
Reel him in, Joe!

1314
01:25:28,590 --> 01:25:31,718
Now pull him in!

1315
01:25:42,403 --> 01:25:44,633
What do you have to say
for yourself, Dekker?

1316
01:25:44,706 --> 01:25:46,901
How does it feel
to be going to jail?

1317
01:25:47,008 --> 01:25:49,806
I'm not talking to you
or anybody about anything.

1318
01:25:49,844 --> 01:25:51,937
Hey, you got any
identification?

1319
01:25:52,013 --> 01:25:54,106
Hey, Joe, he's got a uniform.
Give him the bag.

1320
01:25:54,215 --> 01:25:56,615
Joe!

1321
01:25:56,651 --> 01:25:59,643
Hey, you look so good.

1322
01:25:59,754 --> 01:26:02,052
Thank you so much.

1323
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:05,752
- I told you we'd catch him.
- Oh, that was great.

1324
01:26:05,860 --> 01:26:08,454
That was so great. That was so great.
I couldn't believe it.

1325
01:26:08,496 --> 01:26:11,488
I mean, when you hit the highway...
kind of like...

1326
01:26:11,566 --> 01:26:14,262
- I left a note for you.
- What did it say?

1327
01:26:14,302 --> 01:26:16,270
- Snickerson's.
- Yeah.

1328
01:26:16,304 --> 01:26:18,295
- Snickerson's.
- Snickerson's. We looked for you.

1329
01:26:18,373 --> 01:26:20,898
Yeah, 'cause the room blew up,
and I didn't know if we'd see you again.

1330
01:26:20,975 --> 01:26:22,772
I know. What was that about?
That was so scary.

1331
01:26:22,810 --> 01:26:24,778
- Gus was sleepwalking again.
- Again?

1332
01:26:24,812 --> 01:26:26,803
WIN TV. We're set up
for your interview now.

1333
01:26:26,881 --> 01:26:28,974
- Oh, we have to do an interview.
- Oh, okay.

1334
01:26:29,017 --> 01:26:31,315
You didn't have to tell 'em
I was sleepwalking.

1335
01:26:31,419 --> 01:26:33,979
- We were out looking for this guy...
- We... Well, she...

1336
01:26:34,088 --> 01:26:36,283
- Those guys were so great.
They did everything for us.
- They were so wonderful...

1337
01:26:36,391 --> 01:26:38,416
- If it wasn't for them,
you know, this guy...
- They were wonderful.

1338
01:26:38,526 --> 01:26:41,290
- He deserves to go in jail
'cause he's hurt so many people.
- Yeah, it's true.

1339
01:26:41,396 --> 01:26:43,796
This is Deana Bernini
in Florida...

1340
01:26:43,898 --> 01:26:46,389
with Gus Green
and Joe Waters,

1341
01:26:46,434 --> 01:26:50,495
who helped capture
Dekker Massey,
the bigamist murderer,

1342
01:26:50,538 --> 01:26:55,305
and uncover the $2-1/2 million
in cash and jewels...

1343
01:26:55,410 --> 01:26:58,607
stolen from his unsuspecting wives.

1344
01:26:58,713 --> 01:27:01,546
An incredible story
of the human spirit.

1345
01:27:01,649 --> 01:27:03,844
- Gentlemen?
- Yeah?

1346
01:27:03,885 --> 01:27:05,853
- Your car was stolen.
- Right.

1347
01:27:05,954 --> 01:27:08,354
- You had to steal it back.
- Yeah.

1348
01:27:08,389 --> 01:27:10,983
- You were almost shot.
- Yeah.

1349
01:27:11,092 --> 01:27:14,255
- That's... Yeah.
- At any point were you two scared?

1350
01:27:14,295 --> 01:27:16,456
- Nope.
- Oh, no, no.

1351
01:27:16,564 --> 01:27:18,464
- Well, a little bit.
- Yeah, a little bit.

1352
01:27:18,566 --> 01:27:20,466
- Just a little bit.
- Not too much.

1353
01:27:20,568 --> 01:27:23,059
Well, after all of this,
what's the best part?

1354
01:27:23,171 --> 01:27:25,196
- Uh, we caught him.
- Yeah, capturing him.

1355
01:27:25,273 --> 01:27:27,400
- Yeah, yeah.
- Capturing him, yeah.

1356
01:27:27,475 --> 01:27:30,808
Did you get an insight
into the workings of Massey's mind?

1357
01:27:30,878 --> 01:27:33,312
Th-This guy
was a very bad man.

1358
01:27:33,381 --> 01:27:35,576
- Not a nice person.
- Yeah, yeah. He wasn't nice at all.

1359
01:27:35,617 --> 01:27:38,279
- Everything he did
to those women and all...
- Wow.

1360
01:27:38,386 --> 01:27:40,786
- And he tried to kill both of us.
- Yeah.

1361
01:27:40,888 --> 01:27:43,686
- Yeah.
- I went at him, you know?
He met his match with me.

1362
01:27:43,791 --> 01:27:45,691
- Yeah, he sure did.
- Right, Gus?

1363
01:27:45,793 --> 01:27:48,227
- With both of us, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

1364
01:27:48,296 --> 01:27:51,288
Well, after all of this,
how does it feel...

1365
01:27:51,332 --> 01:27:54,733
to be the recipients
of our $100,000 reward?

1366
01:27:54,802 --> 01:27:57,236
- Are you kidding?
That's the best part.
- Yeah, yeah.

1367
01:27:57,305 --> 01:27:59,398
- Where's the money?
- Yeah.

1368
01:27:59,507 --> 01:28:00,804
- When do we get the money?
- Yeah.

1369
01:28:00,842 --> 01:28:01,740
- When do we get the money?
- Yeah.

1370
01:28:01,843 --> 01:28:03,936
You know, Joe,

1371
01:28:03,978 --> 01:28:07,937
after we pay
for the Ranger 250C,

1372
01:28:07,982 --> 01:28:10,075
replace our boat,

1373
01:28:10,151 --> 01:28:12,244
fix the Barracuda...

1374
01:28:12,353 --> 01:28:15,789
- Joe, do me a favor.
- Yeah, Gus, I'd do anything for you.

1375
01:28:15,890 --> 01:28:18,154
- You know that.
- I know that.

1376
01:28:18,192 --> 01:28:21,787
Stop smoking.
I-I-I want you to stop smoking.

1377
01:28:21,863 --> 01:28:25,390
For me, your wife,
your family, everybody.
We love you, man.

1378
01:28:25,466 --> 01:28:27,400
- Okay?
- Okay, Gus.

1379
01:28:27,468 --> 01:28:29,766
- All right.
- Eh-eh-eh!

1380
01:28:29,804 --> 01:28:31,772
Did you forget?

1381
01:28:39,380 --> 01:28:42,315
Yeah, pay for the resort fire,

1382
01:28:42,383 --> 01:28:45,580
our gear, food, clothing,
flight home...

1383
01:28:45,687 --> 01:28:49,589
we have a grand total
of $42 profit.

1384
01:28:49,691 --> 01:28:52,387
Yeah, at least we
made it home on time, Gus.

1385
01:28:52,427 --> 01:28:54,895
Yeah...
to the wife and family.

1386
01:28:54,929 --> 01:28:57,830
They were happy about that.

1387
01:28:57,899 --> 01:28:59,890
- You know what's great, Gus?
- What, Joe?

1388
01:28:59,934 --> 01:29:02,528
After being here, you realize
you don't have to go far away
to live the good life.

1389
01:29:02,637 --> 01:29:05,231
You sure do. You realize, it's right
in your own backyard, Joe.

1390
01:29:05,273 --> 01:29:08,572
- That's right. I love it.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1391
01:29:08,643 --> 01:29:10,873
- Hey, Gus, you know what we should do?
- What?

1392
01:29:10,945 --> 01:29:13,846
Let's do like we used
to do in the old days and take a dip.

1393
01:29:13,948 --> 01:29:16,473
- It's cold, Joe.
- Yeah.

1394
01:29:16,551 --> 01:29:19,486
What about
that Polar Bear Club in Coney Island?

1395
01:29:19,587 --> 01:29:22,055
Those guys go in the water
in freezing weather.

1396
01:29:22,090 --> 01:29:25,548
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I-I heard about that. It's good
for your heart and everything.

1397
01:29:25,660 --> 01:29:28,356
- Want to try?
- I'll do it if you do it.

1398
01:29:28,463 --> 01:29:30,556
- I'll do it if you do it.
- Just a quick dip.

1399
01:29:30,665 --> 01:29:33,361
A quick dip.

1400
01:29:33,468 --> 01:29:36,995
- Hey, Gus, this is gonna be great.
- Yeah, it's gonna be a ten, Joe.

1401
01:29:37,071 --> 01:29:38,504
- Ten plus.
- Hey...

1402
01:29:38,573 --> 01:29:41,565
Borderline 11!

1403
01:29:47,615 --> 01:29:50,778
- Hey, Gus, what are you
shushing me for?
- I ain't shushing you, Joe.

1404
01:29:50,818 --> 01:29:52,786
- You didn't shush me?
- No. You didn't shush me, did you?

1405
01:29:52,820 --> 01:29:53,787
- You didn't shush me?
- No. You didn't shush me, did you?
