Dude, you gotta hear this.

35
00:03:09,738 --> 00:03:12,229
Meat sticks.

36
00:03:12,308 --> 00:03:13,570
Huh?

37
00:03:13,642 --> 00:03:15,371
You want anything?

38
00:03:15,444 --> 00:03:17,969
What are you having? Pops?

39
00:03:18,047 --> 00:03:21,608
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, whip me up a bowl.

40
00:03:21,684 --> 00:03:25,051
Ooh, uh, sprinkle some, uh,
Cap'n Crunch on top.

41
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,054
Man, what's up?

42
00:03:27,122 --> 00:03:28,783
Dude, pulled another all-nighter.

43
00:03:28,857 --> 00:03:31,417
My blood sugar's all...

44
00:03:32,828 --> 00:03:35,854
Miss Lucille,
don't you look lovely today.

45
00:03:35,931 --> 00:03:37,694
Is that for me?

46
00:03:39,435 --> 00:03:42,598
Hey, hey, come on.
Wait for the milk. Come on.

47
00:04:12,468 --> 00:04:14,197
Neal.

48
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:17,329
Hey, man. Uh, dude,

49
00:04:17,406 --> 00:04:20,705
I-I can't find any spoons.

50
00:04:20,776 --> 00:04:23,142
Right here, Willie.

51
00:04:23,212 --> 00:04:25,942
Oh, fantastic.

52
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:29,041
- Oh, dude, that's nasty.
- Hey.

53
00:04:29,118 --> 00:04:31,518
Neal.

54
00:04:32,955 --> 00:04:34,354
Bruce.

55
00:04:38,627 --> 00:04:41,653
I have Jets and Wackies. Interested?

56
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:45,996
It's a... definite no on the Jets.

57
00:04:46,068 --> 00:04:47,933
A definite yes on the Wackies.

58
00:04:48,003 --> 00:04:49,436
These have banana-flavored bits.

59
00:04:49,505 --> 00:04:51,268
They're the only people that do that.

60
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,035
9.04.

61
00:04:53,108 --> 00:04:54,973
Okay, nine even.

62
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:57,979
But you still owe me $26. 12
on the Donkey Kong Flakes

63
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:00,379
- and the Honeycomb Doorbell, remember?
- Yeah.

64
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:04,180
- Did you hear about the Cheerio on eBay?
- No.

65
00:05:04,253 --> 00:05:06,778
Some kind of Cheerio in their box
approximately the size of a doughnut.

66
00:05:06,855 --> 00:05:09,949
Hard to tell at low-res whether
it's smooth like an actual Cheerio,

67
00:05:10,025 --> 00:05:11,959
or whether it's several
smaller ones melted together.

68
00:05:12,995 --> 00:05:14,121
Probably a two-chip camera.

69
00:05:14,196 --> 00:05:15,128
Anyway,

70
00:05:15,197 --> 00:05:17,427
I got a bid in, so...

71
00:05:17,499 --> 00:05:18,591
fingers crossed.

72
00:05:18,667 --> 00:05:21,067
Yeah, you keep me posted on that.

73
00:05:21,136 --> 00:05:23,604
Originally, it was Cheery Oats,
but they changed it.

74
00:05:23,672 --> 00:05:25,299
General Mills, 1945.

75
00:05:25,374 --> 00:05:28,036
So you've told me.
So what are you having?

76
00:05:31,146 --> 00:05:34,081
Hey, Mr. Tom.

77
00:05:34,149 --> 00:05:36,208
- Is that a new one?
- Australian bush hat.

78
00:05:36,285 --> 00:05:37,946
I just got it.

79
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:41,615
Had to have my shoe guy
add the chinstrap.

80
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:43,681
That's a righteous lid.

81
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,159
I do get lots of comments on it.

82
00:05:46,228 --> 00:05:48,662
Yeah, I'll bet you do.

83
00:05:48,731 --> 00:05:50,562
Thank you.

84
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:57,368
All right.
Made up your mind?

85
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,165
I think I will have the one that sports

86
00:06:01,243 --> 00:06:02,767
the longest-lasting characters

87
00:06:02,845 --> 00:06:05,279
to ever represent a Kellogg's product.

88
00:06:13,288 --> 00:06:14,949
Impressive.

89
00:06:15,023 --> 00:06:17,423
I didn't think you'd know.

90
00:06:17,493 --> 00:06:19,484
It scares me that I do.

91
00:06:26,769 --> 00:06:29,829
Do you have anything
with the Mardi Gras beads on them?

92
00:06:29,905 --> 00:06:31,770
You know, with the purple
and the gold?

93
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,934
Um, yeah.
There's a nice assortment

94
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:37,001
of lovely, meaningless crap
across the street.

95
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:40,810
I suggest the shellacked
baby alligator heads.

96
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:46,317
Why do the tourists
even come here?

97
00:06:46,388 --> 00:06:50,324
Don't they know that Florida
was created specifically for them?

98
00:06:51,794 --> 00:06:54,262
I should just go back to
making some straight tie-dye.

99
00:06:54,329 --> 00:06:56,854
At least I sold a few of those.

100
00:06:56,932 --> 00:07:02,529
But they're just
so horribly decorative.

101
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,814
- How are ya?
- Good.

102
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:23,722
Great. So, uh,

103
00:07:23,792 --> 00:07:26,989
this is like a, uh...
like a cereal bar, or...

104
00:07:27,062 --> 00:07:30,190
- Yeah.
- Cool. Cool idea.

105
00:07:30,265 --> 00:07:32,392
Cool, cool, cool.

106
00:07:32,467 --> 00:07:35,334
Um, what's the most popular?

107
00:07:35,404 --> 00:07:37,201
Uh, in here,
it's anything cocoa.

108
00:07:37,272 --> 00:07:38,739
We get a lot
of stoners in here.

109
00:07:38,807 --> 00:07:40,297
I think, nationally,
it's Corn Flakes.

110
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:41,865
Correct. Corn Flakes.

111
00:07:41,944 --> 00:07:43,809
The first and still the favorite.

112
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,039
Corn Flakes wasn't first, man.

113
00:07:47,115 --> 00:07:49,549
- First mass-produced.
- Oh.

114
00:07:49,618 --> 00:07:51,984
Okay. All right.
Mass-produced. Uh-huh.

115
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:53,521
You know that's what I meant.

116
00:07:54,923 --> 00:07:58,415
So, uh, what was the first?
Like, Wheaties or something?

117
00:07:58,493 --> 00:08:00,427
Like no.

118
00:08:00,495 --> 00:08:02,690
Wheaties is 1924.

119
00:08:03,799 --> 00:08:07,200
The first cereal
was Kellogg brothers.

120
00:08:07,269 --> 00:08:09,169
Took a bunch of wheat
and mashed it up.

121
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:10,500
Made, like, a giant flake

122
00:08:10,572 --> 00:08:13,700
which you could break up
into little smaller flakes.

123
00:08:13,775 --> 00:08:16,403
Cereal was health food then.

124
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:19,276
The whole thing was started
by these radical

125
00:08:19,348 --> 00:08:24,547
religious, health-freak nuts
up in Battle Creek.

126
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:28,488
Disciples of this, uh,
Christian Science chick.

127
00:08:28,557 --> 00:08:30,286
Mary Baker Eddy.

128
00:08:30,359 --> 00:08:33,453
Yeah. Isn't that a trip, man?

129
00:08:33,528 --> 00:08:36,895
Cereal as religion?

130
00:08:36,965 --> 00:08:39,900
It's like we're in church right now.

131
00:08:39,968 --> 00:08:42,402
C.W. Post wasn't
a health nut or insightful.

132
00:08:42,471 --> 00:08:44,837
He was a failed inventor
and a snake oil salesman.

133
00:08:44,907 --> 00:08:47,273
He was a dick.

134
00:08:47,342 --> 00:08:50,573
He built a factory right across
the street from the Kellogg brothers.

135
00:08:50,646 --> 00:08:54,013
They would riot in the streets,
man, over cereal.

136
00:08:54,082 --> 00:08:58,314
Actually the riots to which you refer
happened over a softball game.

137
00:09:02,057 --> 00:09:03,581
All right.
This place is great.

138
00:09:03,659 --> 00:09:05,251
It's completely cross-demographic.

139
00:09:05,327 --> 00:09:07,557
- Everybody loves cereal, right?
- Yeah.

140
00:09:07,629 --> 00:09:10,120
Eight essential vitamins and
all part of a balanced breakfast.

141
00:09:10,198 --> 00:09:11,756
Stuart Zeringue.

142
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,733
Neal Downs.

143
00:09:13,802 --> 00:09:15,167
Neal. Pleasure.

144
00:09:15,237 --> 00:09:16,704
What can I get you?

145
00:09:16,772 --> 00:09:19,798
Um...

146
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,467
I don't know.
What is that?

147
00:09:21,543 --> 00:09:23,067
- Yeah.
- That is Quake.

148
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:25,739
Used to be Quisp's rival
in the commercials.

149
00:09:25,814 --> 00:09:27,304
- Quisp's. Yeah, yeah.
- It's discontinued.

150
00:09:27,382 --> 00:09:30,749
- They don't make this anymore.
- So, how do you still get it?

151
00:09:35,557 --> 00:09:38,287
Huh.

152
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,454
Um, so are you...
are you the owner here?

153
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:43,259
No. The manager.

154
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:46,358
The owner's the guy
in his jammies over there.

155
00:09:46,435 --> 00:09:48,232
Oh. Hello.

156
00:09:48,303 --> 00:09:51,830
Uh...

157
00:09:51,907 --> 00:09:53,568
Do you, uh...

158
00:09:53,642 --> 00:09:56,839
Do you know if he's ever
thought about franchising?

159
00:09:59,648 --> 00:10:02,276
What? What? What?

160
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:05,684
No. Look, the franchise model
is very simple

161
00:10:05,754 --> 00:10:08,348
and very low risk to the franchisee,
you know what I mean?

162
00:10:08,423 --> 00:10:10,357
You guys have already done
the hardest part.

163
00:10:10,425 --> 00:10:12,916
But now you just have to get,
you know, like, 50 other people

164
00:10:12,995 --> 00:10:15,623
to do what you guys have
already figured out how to do,

165
00:10:15,697 --> 00:10:18,689
then you implement
some economies of scale,

166
00:10:18,767 --> 00:10:21,497
and then you just make,
like, a bunch of money.

167
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:23,435
Yeah. That sounds great, man.

168
00:10:23,505 --> 00:10:25,996
We could, um, put them in

169
00:10:26,074 --> 00:10:27,701
shopping malls and gas stations,

170
00:10:27,776 --> 00:10:29,505
<i>and call small ones "grande,"</i>

171
00:10:29,578 --> 00:10:32,012
and come up with precious
Latin names for the cereal.

172
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,071
We could be titans of industry!

173
00:10:34,149 --> 00:10:36,083
That's why nobody likes us, man,

174
00:10:36,151 --> 00:10:38,711
'cause everything in America
has to be franchised

175
00:10:38,787 --> 00:10:40,516
and standardized and "cerealized"

176
00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:42,181
till it becomes totally
fuckin' homogenized.

177
00:10:42,257 --> 00:10:44,623
We're capitalists,
and that's how we capitalize.

178
00:10:44,693 --> 00:10:48,629
I mean, look, you are practicing
capitalism right now...

179
00:10:48,697 --> 00:10:51,825
right this... second.

180
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,333
Keep the change.
Do you see how...

181
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:55,529
Look, all I'm trying
to say is,

182
00:10:55,604 --> 00:10:57,731
someone is gonna capitalize
on this great idea.

183
00:10:57,806 --> 00:10:59,740
Why shouldn't
that someone be you?

184
00:10:59,808 --> 00:11:02,072
Because it would strangle him.

185
00:11:02,144 --> 00:11:04,772
You can create
or you can accumulate,

186
00:11:04,846 --> 00:11:06,245
but you can't nurture
your soul

187
00:11:06,314 --> 00:11:09,078
and babysit a big pile of money
at the same time.

188
00:11:09,151 --> 00:11:11,517
You could open a thousand stores
and make a billion dollars,

189
00:11:11,586 --> 00:11:13,952
and you know what you'd be
at the end of the day?

190
00:11:14,022 --> 00:11:15,284
A businessman.

191
00:11:15,357 --> 00:11:17,882
Right. I mean,
what's wrong with that?

192
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:19,756
Look, l-l-l...

193
00:11:19,828 --> 00:11:22,991
I am totally spaced.

194
00:11:23,065 --> 00:11:28,731
What is... the fourth... charm?

195
00:11:28,804 --> 00:11:33,969
Hearts, moons, stars...

196
00:11:35,577 --> 00:11:37,511
and...

197
00:11:39,047 --> 00:11:41,447
Clover... Clovers.

198
00:11:41,516 --> 00:11:44,041
Clover! Yeah!

199
00:11:45,053 --> 00:11:47,453
Green clover!

200
00:11:47,522 --> 00:11:48,955
Thank you.

201
00:11:49,024 --> 00:11:50,889
They put these new ones in.

202
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,486
Completely messed me up.

203
00:11:57,232 --> 00:11:59,359
Yeah, it gets a little hazy.

204
00:12:00,936 --> 00:12:02,369
Okay, I'm sorry.

205
00:12:02,437 --> 00:12:05,565
I guess you can just
keep doing this...

206
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,870
what you're doing now...

207
00:12:07,943 --> 00:12:11,879
until you become... that.

208
00:12:25,527 --> 00:12:26,960
Wait.

209
00:12:42,677 --> 00:12:45,077
This is...

210
00:12:45,147 --> 00:12:47,877
- Excuse me.
- Enjoy.

211
00:12:47,949 --> 00:12:50,747
I need you to be done here.

212
00:12:50,819 --> 00:12:52,411
- Willie!
- What?

213
00:12:52,487 --> 00:12:53,749
I'm done here.

214
00:12:53,822 --> 00:12:55,312
Yeah. Okay.

215
00:13:01,163 --> 00:13:02,994
- What do you wanna do?
- Hold hands.

216
00:13:03,064 --> 00:13:04,088
All right!

217
00:13:11,706 --> 00:13:13,435
<i># Run along #</i>

218
00:13:13,508 --> 00:13:17,137
<i># Run a long way
to find the one #</i>

219
00:13:17,212 --> 00:13:21,478
<i># Find the one
who could turn you on #</i>

220
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,485
<i># Underneath cloudless sun #</i>

221
00:13:26,855 --> 00:13:29,346
<i># Can't you see #</i>

222
00:13:29,424 --> 00:13:33,520
<i># If I could be anything
I want to be #</i>

223
00:13:33,595 --> 00:13:36,860
<i># I would be you, see
Can't you see #</i>

224
00:13:36,932 --> 00:13:41,266
<i># If I could be anything #</i>

225
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:15,529
Thanks for your applause.
Thank you.

226
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:19,199
Feels like it took forever
to finally get our CD.

227
00:14:19,274 --> 00:14:20,536
Finally finished it.

228
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:22,474
So if you want one,

229
00:14:22,544 --> 00:14:24,876
go talk to Jay
at the back door.

230
00:14:24,946 --> 00:14:27,244
Thanks. Good night.

231
00:14:32,921 --> 00:14:36,379
Neal! Neal!

232
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,323
What is up your heinie?

233
00:14:38,393 --> 00:14:41,419
Those guys started making
that CD way after I did.

234
00:14:43,999 --> 00:14:45,591
You know, I just... I can't...

235
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:49,068
I can't just rush it and churn out
some lame-ass shit, you know?

236
00:14:50,538 --> 00:14:52,836
I mean, if my stuff ain't great,

237
00:14:52,907 --> 00:14:55,432
if it ain't fuckin' incendiary, you know,

238
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,137
then I'm just another chump

239
00:14:57,212 --> 00:14:58,941
with a PowerBook and a microphone

240
00:14:59,014 --> 00:15:01,574
making a CD, you know?

241
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,584
It's so VH1,
it makes my ass clench.

242
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:06,587
Well, maybe being incendiary
takes more than spare minutes.

243
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,452
What you need to do

244
00:15:08,523 --> 00:15:10,718
is take a week off
Cerealville and finish.

245
00:15:10,792 --> 00:15:13,158
I can't just take a week off.
It's my job.

246
00:15:13,228 --> 00:15:14,991
You know, the means
by which I live?

247
00:15:15,063 --> 00:15:17,793
Why don't you live off some of
that cash you've been hoarding?

248
00:15:17,866 --> 00:15:21,461
No, that's for pressing
and printing and jewel boxes.

249
00:15:21,536 --> 00:15:23,561
If I don't have that money,
I don't have a release.

250
00:15:23,638 --> 00:15:24,627
I can't.

251
00:15:26,341 --> 00:15:28,206
I quit my job today.

252
00:15:29,611 --> 00:15:32,273
- You what?
- I didn't tell you?

253
00:15:32,347 --> 00:15:35,578
No! You gave up your stall.

254
00:15:37,218 --> 00:15:39,311
Oh, okay. Great.

255
00:15:39,387 --> 00:15:40,911
So, what, are you
gonna go back to

256
00:15:40,989 --> 00:15:41,921
living on Decatur Street

257
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:43,321
with the fuckin' gutter punks?

258
00:15:43,391 --> 00:15:46,792
No. I have an idea.
Hire me at Flakes.

259
00:15:46,861 --> 00:15:48,522
What?

260
00:15:48,596 --> 00:15:51,463
That way, you can get your week
and finish your CD,

261
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:54,195
and I can get some extra cash
until I figure out my next move.

262
00:15:54,269 --> 00:15:55,702
It's a great idea.

263
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:57,795
No, it's not a great idea.
It's a fucked idea.

264
00:15:59,107 --> 00:16:00,938
You can't work at Flakes.
No way.

265
00:16:08,049 --> 00:16:12,042
Hey. It would be a total
conflict of interest.

266
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,213
- Why?
- How would I boss you around?

267
00:16:14,289 --> 00:16:16,951
How do we say you aren't getting
special treatment 'cause you fuck the boss?

268
00:16:17,025 --> 00:16:19,789
Well, if that's the problem, then ha-ha.

269
00:16:19,861 --> 00:16:22,125
That's not the point, okay?
The point is...

270
00:16:22,197 --> 00:16:24,097
The point is that
the road to hell starts,

271
00:16:24,165 --> 00:16:25,632
okay, with one little tiny step,

272
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,565
'cause you got a fuckin'
cash flow problem.

273
00:16:27,635 --> 00:16:30,729
I won't let you do it.
I won't make you a whore.

274
00:16:30,805 --> 00:16:32,466
A whore?

275
00:16:34,209 --> 00:16:35,642
Jesus, Neal. Come on.

276
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,575
Well, actually,
that might be a good idea.

277
00:16:37,645 --> 00:16:39,977
Maybe I should do a little whoring.
It'd be fun.

278
00:16:40,048 --> 00:16:44,041
- Gotta let me watch.
- I'll make you watch.

279
00:16:44,119 --> 00:16:46,417
- You know I'm right.
- Oh, that's it. You're right.

280
00:16:46,488 --> 00:16:49,082
When you're 70, and you've
finally finished your CD,

281
00:16:49,157 --> 00:16:51,489
you can come and visit me
in my cardboard box.

282
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:53,493
I'm gonna finish my CD, okay?

283
00:16:53,561 --> 00:16:57,622
And you are not gonna sleep
in a cardboard box...

284
00:16:57,699 --> 00:16:59,633
'cause you haven't heard
my great idea.

285
00:16:59,701 --> 00:17:01,464
Move in with me.

286
00:17:01,536 --> 00:17:05,199
Move in with you?
Are you crazy?

287
00:17:05,273 --> 00:17:07,571
You don't move in together
out of pity, Neal!

288
00:17:07,642 --> 00:17:09,473
It's not out of pity.
I'm trying to make you happy.

289
00:17:09,544 --> 00:17:12,206
And that's gonna make me happy?
Moving in with you?

290
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,374
- Well, it'll make me happy.
- Well, fine, then.

291
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:17,008
Okay, wait a minute.

292
00:17:17,085 --> 00:17:18,552
When you say,
"Fine, then," does that mean

293
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,178
"Fine, then, end of discussion,"

294
00:17:20,255 --> 00:17:22,086
or "Fine, then, I'll move in
with you, you idiot"?

295
00:17:22,157 --> 00:17:24,352
What do you think?

296
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,498
Oh, look in the suitcase.

297
00:17:34,569 --> 00:17:37,094
I made us
a living-in-sin present.

298
00:17:40,909 --> 00:17:43,605
Oh, wow!

299
00:17:43,678 --> 00:17:45,612
You painted these?
These are amazing.

300
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,011
Mm-hmm.

301
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:58,188
There.

302
00:17:58,259 --> 00:18:00,921
All shacked up
like naughty Catholics.

303
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:03,363
Mmm.

304
00:18:06,801 --> 00:18:08,496
Almost.

305
00:18:13,341 --> 00:18:15,707
What's that for?

306
00:18:15,777 --> 00:18:17,642
This.

307
00:18:17,712 --> 00:18:21,045
Why, Mr. Downs, that would
leave me in my altogethers.

308
00:18:21,115 --> 00:18:23,242
That's the idea, Miss Katz.

309
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:37,295
Airstream.

310
00:18:37,365 --> 00:18:40,300
- But it has to be a shiny one.
- Mm-hmm.

311
00:18:40,368 --> 00:18:43,030
- Not dull gray, shiny.
- Yeah.

312
00:18:43,104 --> 00:18:46,301
And we'll pull it with...
with one of those

313
00:18:46,374 --> 00:18:49,434
enormous, old
Eldorado convertibles.

314
00:18:49,511 --> 00:18:51,979
- Yeah.
- And we'll wear those helmets

315
00:18:52,046 --> 00:18:53,980
with the walkie-talkies in them.

316
00:18:54,048 --> 00:18:56,073
- Steer horns on the Caddy.
- A must.

317
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:59,085
- Yeah.
- And we'll park in Good Sam campgrounds

318
00:18:59,153 --> 00:19:01,280
and Wal-Mart parking lots,

319
00:19:01,356 --> 00:19:03,085
and we'll keep
the old people awake

320
00:19:03,157 --> 00:19:05,717
with the rock music,

321
00:19:05,793 --> 00:19:07,658
which we'll have boatloads of,

322
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:10,095
because we'll use
our AARP discounts

323
00:19:10,164 --> 00:19:12,689
to buy as many records as we want.

324
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:15,497
Nothing but CDs and subwoofers
in the trunk of the Caddy.

325
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:17,128
Mm-hmm.

326
00:19:17,205 --> 00:19:19,196
And no one will suspect

327
00:19:19,274 --> 00:19:22,437
that the two old farts
in the antique Airstream

328
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,705
are the famous Mr. Neal Downs,

329
00:19:24,779 --> 00:19:26,576
rock and roll cult leader,

330
00:19:26,648 --> 00:19:28,616
and the hypnotic

331
00:19:28,683 --> 00:19:32,278
Miss Pussy Katz, art legend.

332
00:19:32,353 --> 00:19:35,720
Incestuous twins
of different mothers.

333
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:44,195
What could be new
about eating?

334
00:19:44,265 --> 00:19:46,495
I don't know.
Maybe it's a new diet thing.

335
00:19:46,568 --> 00:19:48,433
Put it in your ass
and digest it backwards.

336
00:19:48,503 --> 00:19:50,494
It'd be hard to eat an apple.

337
00:19:51,806 --> 00:19:55,298
- A shish kebab?
- Oh, God!

338
00:19:55,376 --> 00:19:56,866
Soup would take a long time.

339
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,606
Yeah, soup would
take a long time.

340
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,773
- Sushi'd be fun.
- Yeah.

341
00:20:03,384 --> 00:20:05,944
What are you doing, man?

342
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,385
Handles.

343
00:20:07,455 --> 00:20:09,582
Got a gig with
the High-steppers tonight.

344
00:20:09,657 --> 00:20:11,955
- Must have grippage.
- High-steppers?

345
00:20:12,026 --> 00:20:14,392
Man, how do you play
that brass band shit?

346
00:20:14,462 --> 00:20:16,726
- I play it all, Homer.
- Gentlemen,

347
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:18,163
behold.

348
00:20:18,232 --> 00:20:21,998
I bring tidings... of great joy.

349
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,594
Bloody hell.

350
00:20:24,739 --> 00:20:27,970
A box of cereal?
In here?

351
00:20:28,042 --> 00:20:31,273
No, no, no, no.
This is not cereal.

352
00:20:31,346 --> 00:20:33,644
This is Saturday mornings
watching DangerMouse,

353
00:20:33,715 --> 00:20:35,580
eating Cool Whip out of a tub.

354
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:37,515
What was that...
What was that jingle?

355
00:20:37,585 --> 00:20:39,519
# We are the Freakies
We are the Freakies #

356
00:20:39,587 --> 00:20:41,384
# This is a Freaky tree #

357
00:20:41,456 --> 00:20:44,619
# We never miss a meal
'cause we love our cereal #

358
00:20:44,692 --> 00:20:46,182
- Right on!
- I want it. How much?

359
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,693
- Thirty.
- Deal.

360
00:20:47,762 --> 00:20:49,821
Thirty bucks for old cereal?

361
00:20:49,897 --> 00:20:51,228
Come on.

362
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:53,199
There's people who would pay
30 grand for what's in this box.

363
00:20:53,267 --> 00:20:55,428
Yeah, some very stupid people.

364
00:20:55,503 --> 00:20:56,936
For childhood in a box?

365
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:59,940
Whose childhood? Were you even born
when they made those things?

366
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,600
Put them on your account?

367
00:21:01,676 --> 00:21:03,200
I wasn't around for
the Velvet Underground, either,

368
00:21:03,277 --> 00:21:05,541
but I sure as shit
know who they are.

369
00:21:05,613 --> 00:21:07,274
Well, let's pop
them open, Goober.

370
00:21:07,348 --> 00:21:09,282
Nope. Emergency stash.

371
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:11,375
Hey.

372
00:21:11,452 --> 00:21:12,749
Remember me?

373
00:21:14,222 --> 00:21:16,520
Called me Strawberry.

374
00:21:17,558 --> 00:21:19,924
Yeah. Hi.

375
00:21:21,763 --> 00:21:25,597
You, uh...
You lent me this.

376
00:21:25,667 --> 00:21:27,567
Oh, yeah.
Uh, what'd you think?

377
00:21:27,635 --> 00:21:29,500
Oh, my God.
It totally shook me.

378
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:31,401
Yeah, it's some sick,
amazing shit, right?

379
00:21:32,907 --> 00:21:34,738
Oh, he's a fucking genius.

380
00:21:34,809 --> 00:21:37,369
I, like, made MP3s
for everyone I know.

381
00:21:37,445 --> 00:21:40,107
Whoa. You made MP3s?

382
00:21:40,181 --> 00:21:42,115
You robbed Gil Scott-Heron?

383
00:21:42,183 --> 00:21:45,914
I-I-I just thought...

384
00:21:45,987 --> 00:21:47,682
I know what you just thought.
Here's what I just think.

385
00:21:47,755 --> 00:21:49,279
Go out there and buy
20 copies of his records

386
00:21:49,357 --> 00:21:50,722
so his kids get
their fucking money.

387
00:21:50,792 --> 00:21:52,259
Don't you think a black artist
in the '70s

388
00:21:52,326 --> 00:21:53,953
didn't get ripped off
enough by his label?

389
00:21:54,028 --> 00:21:55,359
Yeah. Yeah, 'cause as musicians,

390
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:57,193
we gotta be thinking
about that kind of shit,

391
00:21:57,265 --> 00:21:59,529
'cause one day in the future...

392
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,194
or some of us, the very distant future...

393
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:05,034
we're gonna be, like, living
off of royalties and shit.

394
00:22:05,106 --> 00:22:07,233
Um, actually, for Neal,

395
00:22:07,308 --> 00:22:09,003
it's gonna be
in the very near future,

396
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:10,806
'cause he's gonna finish
his CD in a week.

397
00:22:10,878 --> 00:22:14,006
One week from today.
It's gonna be incendiary.

398
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:16,277
No, shit? A week?
Well, how come...

399
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,942
Who's playing drums
on it, dude?

400
00:22:18,019 --> 00:22:20,487
- Dude, why didn't you...
- All right, all right, all right.

401
00:22:20,555 --> 00:22:22,819
You'll keep this low until
I get a chance to tell Willie,

402
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:24,915
but I think I'm gonna
take a week off and...

403
00:22:24,992 --> 00:22:27,756
Hey, something's happening across
the street that's blowing my mind.

404
00:22:41,309 --> 00:22:44,938
That's not a new concept.

405
00:22:45,012 --> 00:22:47,242
Aw, hell, no,
that's not a new concept.

406
00:22:47,315 --> 00:22:49,840
It's a stolen concept.

407
00:22:49,917 --> 00:22:52,283
Who the fuck would...

408
00:22:52,353 --> 00:22:53,945
- No way.
- What?

409
00:22:54,021 --> 00:22:54,988
No way.

410
00:22:55,056 --> 00:22:56,648
That's the banana Republican.

411
00:22:56,724 --> 00:22:58,658
It's the guy that was
asking me all the questions.

412
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:04,762
He was pumping me
for information the whole time.

413
00:23:04,832 --> 00:23:06,299
Probably already had
a lease on the building.

414
00:23:06,367 --> 00:23:09,734
Well, isn't Flakes, like,
patent pending or something?

415
00:23:09,804 --> 00:23:11,863
Willie should sue
the shit out of that guy.

416
00:23:11,939 --> 00:23:13,372
Nah.

417
00:23:13,441 --> 00:23:16,171
That asshole ain't gonna make us
soil ourselves with lawyers.

418
00:23:16,244 --> 00:23:18,178
Come on.

419
00:23:18,246 --> 00:23:21,147
Oh, come on.
We have to.

420
00:23:57,785 --> 00:24:00,253
Welcome to New Original Flakes.
Can I help you guys?

421
00:24:00,321 --> 00:24:03,757
Yeah, you can, actually,
uh, Stuart.

422
00:24:03,825 --> 00:24:06,316
My friends and I
are in the mood for some cereal.

423
00:24:06,394 --> 00:24:08,453
Perhaps something vintage. Um...

424
00:24:10,131 --> 00:24:12,463
You have any Fruit Brute?

425
00:24:14,068 --> 00:24:15,501
Um...

426
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:18,505
It's one of the discontinued
monster cereals.

427
00:24:18,573 --> 00:24:21,701
Um, I've got Boo Berry.

428
00:24:21,776 --> 00:24:24,745
Do you now?
So does Winn-Dixie.

429
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:32,648
I've also got a box of...
Yummy Mummy.

430
00:24:35,623 --> 00:24:37,022
No, thanks.

431
00:24:37,091 --> 00:24:39,685
Yummy Mummy is the lesser
of the monster cereals.

432
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,228
No, I think
I'm more in the mood

433
00:24:42,296 --> 00:24:44,161
for a bowl of, uh, Alpen.

434
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:46,860
- That's, uh, muesli from Can...
- Canada.

435
00:24:46,934 --> 00:24:48,799
Swiss style.

436
00:24:49,904 --> 00:24:52,372
Large, medium or small?

437
00:24:53,574 --> 00:24:55,565
<i>Grande.</i>

438
00:25:28,242 --> 00:25:30,107
I'll tell you what.

439
00:25:30,177 --> 00:25:32,805
Since we're neighbors,
first bowl's on the house.

440
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,848
Aw.

441
00:25:37,084 --> 00:25:40,076
Does that include the extra milk?

442
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:04,908
He's a chump!

443
00:26:04,979 --> 00:26:08,779
Skim milk, dude.
Blue milk and a plastic spoon?

444
00:26:08,849 --> 00:26:11,317
Looks nice, though, man.
Like all clean and shit.

445
00:26:11,385 --> 00:26:13,444
Ah, you got nothing to worry
about, man. He's a pinhead.

446
00:26:13,521 --> 00:26:14,783
He's gonna be eating our dust.

447
00:26:14,855 --> 00:26:16,186
No, man, he'll take the tourists.

448
00:26:16,257 --> 00:26:18,316
They don't tip anyway.
Can't touch Flakes.

449
00:26:18,392 --> 00:26:20,519
Not our people.
No fucking way.

450
00:26:20,594 --> 00:26:22,653
They did have
that Yummy Mummy stuff.

451
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:26,131
It's C.W. Post, man.

452
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,998
- It's Battle Creek all over again!
- Don't freak out, Willie.

453
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,264
Don't freak.
Look, listen to me.

454
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:32,670
This guy is gonna be belly-up
in a few days.

455
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:36,267
Post is what divided
the Kellogg brothers, man!

456
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:37,834
Little Kellogg took over,

457
00:26:37,912 --> 00:26:38,844
sold out,

458
00:26:38,913 --> 00:26:40,210
totally screwed big Kellogg!

459
00:26:40,281 --> 00:26:42,010
They never reconciled!

460
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:45,484
- Utopia? Hah! Gone!
- Hey, we're not the Kellogg brothers.

461
00:26:45,553 --> 00:26:47,418
- Riots!
- We're not the Kellogg brothers, okay?

462
00:26:47,488 --> 00:26:49,956
Look, this guy's a loser.
Come on. What does he got?

463
00:26:50,024 --> 00:26:52,686
Some, uh, Windex and a bunch
of hard chairs that match.

464
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:56,526
Woo-fuckin'-hoo.
He's a joke.

465
00:26:56,597 --> 00:26:58,462
Come on. Who...

466
00:26:58,532 --> 00:27:00,796
Who's the Captain of Crunch?

467
00:27:00,868 --> 00:27:02,392
Huh? Come on.

468
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:04,700
Who's the Champion of Breakfasts?

469
00:27:04,772 --> 00:27:06,637
I wanna...
I wanna hear you say it.

00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,987
has got Willie very freaked out.

477
00:27:21,055 --> 00:27:22,647
I'm not just gonna abandon the guy.

478
00:27:22,723 --> 00:27:24,486
I think that'd be a little bit selfish.

479
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:27,322
Taking care of yourself isn't selfish.

480
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:28,760
I'm gonna do it, okay?

481
00:27:28,829 --> 00:27:30,888
It's just not the right week.

482
00:27:30,965 --> 00:27:32,660
So make it the right week.

483
00:27:32,733 --> 00:27:34,132
Hire me.

484
00:27:34,201 --> 00:27:35,896
Look, it's not
a conflict of interest

485
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:37,562
if you're not there.

486
00:27:37,638 --> 00:27:38,935
You don't even have to pay me.

487
00:27:39,006 --> 00:27:41,372
I'll just babysit the hippy man

488
00:27:41,442 --> 00:27:42,875
while you do your work...

489
00:27:42,943 --> 00:27:45,002
you know, your real work.

490
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:48,571
I'm sure I can figure out
how to fix cereal.

491
00:27:48,649 --> 00:27:51,049
Is it that you can't hear me?

492
00:27:51,118 --> 00:27:52,881
No, I hear you.

493
00:27:52,953 --> 00:27:53,920
You're scared.

494
00:27:53,988 --> 00:27:54,955
Scared it'll suck.

495
00:27:55,022 --> 00:27:56,182
Scared it'll be great.

496
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:58,725
Look, I know scared.

497
00:27:58,793 --> 00:28:00,351
I'm scared all the time.

498
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:02,362
And right now, I'm scared

499
00:28:02,396 --> 00:28:04,364
you're a cereal guy
doing a little music

500
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:08,198
instead of a musician
working in a cereal bar.

501
00:28:10,304 --> 00:28:12,295
A cereal guy?

502
00:28:13,574 --> 00:28:15,974
Thanks for that, baby.

503
00:28:16,043 --> 00:28:18,307
Thanks for the love and support.

504
00:28:22,216 --> 00:28:24,707
It is love.

505
00:29:04,725 --> 00:29:06,659
Nice one, Tom.
Sherlock Holmes.

506
00:29:06,727 --> 00:29:08,922
It's a deer slayer.
I had to order it.

507
00:29:08,996 --> 00:29:10,861
- You ever slay any deer?
- Nope.

508
00:29:10,931 --> 00:29:13,331
You got the proper headgear for it.

509
00:29:17,138 --> 00:29:19,072
Miss Lucille,
how the fuck are you?

510
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,005
Don't you be trash-mouthing me, little man.

511
00:29:21,075 --> 00:29:23,839
- I'll fuck you up.
- How about trying something new today?

512
00:29:23,911 --> 00:29:26,675
Some Apple Jacks or Honeycombs...
the one-inch?

513
00:29:26,747 --> 00:29:28,612
Just give me my cereal,
you little cracker.

514
00:29:28,682 --> 00:29:30,547
Don't make me go across
the street on your ass.

515
00:29:30,618 --> 00:29:32,279
Don't do that.
I'd break off our engagement.

516
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:34,184
They're giving cereal away
over there,

517
00:29:34,255 --> 00:29:35,688
but I ain't like that.

518
00:29:35,756 --> 00:29:38,748
Now fix me my cereal,
you little motherfucker.

519
00:29:38,826 --> 00:29:40,691
Miss Lucille's
special concoction...

520
00:29:40,761 --> 00:29:42,626
Cocoa Puffs,
Cocoa Krispies,

521
00:29:42,696 --> 00:29:45,164
chocolate chips
and chocolate milk.

522
00:29:45,232 --> 00:29:46,995
Mmm!

523
00:29:47,067 --> 00:29:48,932
One Soul Power Special.

524
00:29:49,003 --> 00:29:52,769
Now, before I started eating this,
I was white as your ass.

525
00:29:53,774 --> 00:29:56,902
Hey, why is that
phony Flakes guy

526
00:29:56,977 --> 00:29:59,275
hanging up flags?

527
00:29:59,346 --> 00:30:01,610
Looks like
a used car place.

528
00:30:03,417 --> 00:30:06,318
Oh, dang, he is desperate.

529
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:08,753
He's gonna have
the Cheese Rock 104 van any minute

530
00:30:08,822 --> 00:30:10,949
giving out free hot dogs and Cokes.

531
00:30:11,025 --> 00:30:13,687
Yeah, man.
Hot dogs and shit.

532
00:30:13,761 --> 00:30:15,626
I told you he'd tank.
I told you.

533
00:30:15,696 --> 00:30:17,561
Yeah, we kicked his dick
in the dirt!

534
00:30:17,631 --> 00:30:19,826
Yeah! We beat somebody
at something!

535
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,765
We're gonna be here forever!

536
00:30:21,835 --> 00:30:23,826
- We're like cockroaches!
- Whoo!

537
00:30:23,904 --> 00:30:27,635
- Flakes forever, man!
- Flakes forever!

538
00:30:27,708 --> 00:30:29,869
Flakes! Flakes! Flakes! Flakes!

539
00:30:29,944 --> 00:30:32,003
Flakes! Flakes! Flakes! Flakes!

540
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:34,274
Flakes! Flakes!
Flakes! Flakes!

541
00:30:34,348 --> 00:30:37,044
Flakes! Flakes! Flakes!
Flakes! Flakes!

542
00:30:37,117 --> 00:30:40,143
- Whoo!
- Flakes! Flakes! Flakes! Flakes!

543
00:30:40,221 --> 00:30:43,679
Flakes! Flakes! Flakes! Flakes!
Flakes! Flakes! Flakes!

544
00:30:43,757 --> 00:30:46,021
Flakes! Flakes! Flakes! Flakes! Flakes!

545
00:30:46,093 --> 00:30:48,186
- Flakes! Flakes! Flakes! Flakes!
- Neal!

546
00:30:48,262 --> 00:30:50,355
- Flakes! Flakes!
- Neal!

547
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:53,298
Flakes. Flakes. Flakes. Flakes.

548
00:30:53,367 --> 00:30:56,029
Look, this is nonsense.
Take care of yourself.

549
00:30:56,103 --> 00:30:57,434
Willie's happy,

550
00:30:57,504 --> 00:30:59,836
so hire me and go do
your week, okay?

551
00:30:59,907 --> 00:31:03,206
Whatever it was that was
sufficient to get us to this place

552
00:31:03,277 --> 00:31:05,643
is insufficient
to get us to the next place.

553
00:31:05,713 --> 00:31:07,806
I got that from a fortune cookie,
and it's true.

554
00:31:07,881 --> 00:31:10,543
You have to leave this place
to get to the next place.

555
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:12,518
So hire me and do your week.

556
00:31:13,954 --> 00:31:17,185
- Can we talk about this another time?
- No, Neal. Come on.

557
00:31:17,258 --> 00:31:19,488
This is ridiculous.

558
00:31:21,128 --> 00:31:23,358
Okay.

559
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:25,660
- You gotta promise me one thing.
- Yeah.

560
00:31:25,733 --> 00:31:27,667
No matter what happens
in our professional life,

561
00:31:27,735 --> 00:31:31,000
- Mm-hmm.
- it will not affect our private life.

562
00:31:31,071 --> 00:31:33,596
- Okay.
- Okay, that means if I boss you around,

563
00:31:33,674 --> 00:31:35,301
make you work late,
fire you, anything,

564
00:31:35,376 --> 00:31:37,241
- it's not going to affect our private life.
- Yeah.

565
00:31:37,311 --> 00:31:39,905
Yeah. That's easy. Yeah.
Okay. I promise.

566
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:42,778
Okay. Then you're hired.

567
00:31:46,353 --> 00:31:48,651
Now you're fired.

568
00:31:52,893 --> 00:31:54,884
You promised.

569
00:32:57,725 --> 00:33:00,956
As soon as business picks up,
I'll be sure to give you a call.

570
00:33:01,028 --> 00:33:03,690
No, I can help you pick up
your business right now.

571
00:33:03,764 --> 00:33:06,358
See, I think I can help you
put Flakes out of business,

572
00:33:06,433 --> 00:33:08,264
and then you can make
all the money you want.

573
00:33:08,335 --> 00:33:09,700
You wanna put Flakes
out of business?

574
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:11,704
I have to. Mercy killing.

575
00:33:11,772 --> 00:33:13,637
You in?

576
00:33:13,707 --> 00:33:14,867
Did your boyfriend dump you?

577
00:33:14,942 --> 00:33:17,706
Is that really relevant
in a job interview?

578
00:33:17,778 --> 00:33:19,575
Right.

579
00:33:19,646 --> 00:33:21,170
Sorry.

580
00:33:21,248 --> 00:33:23,045
Look, I'm not a bad guy, you know?

581
00:33:23,117 --> 00:33:24,209
I just saw an opportunity here

582
00:33:24,284 --> 00:33:25,376
that wasn't being taken advantage of.

583
00:33:25,452 --> 00:33:26,714
Those guys are never
gonna do anything

584
00:33:26,787 --> 00:33:27,754
with that business.

585
00:33:27,821 --> 00:33:29,345
I never said
you were a bad guy.

586
00:33:29,423 --> 00:33:31,653
I said, I think I can help you.

587
00:33:31,725 --> 00:33:34,558
Okay, well... Look, thanks,

588
00:33:34,628 --> 00:33:36,152
but I think I'll be okay.

589
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:37,891
It's a pretty simple business model.

590
00:33:37,965 --> 00:33:39,296
People like to eat cereal,

591
00:33:39,366 --> 00:33:41,231
and they like to be
in a place that's clean,

592
00:33:41,301 --> 00:33:43,769
and where the staff
doesn't yell at you.

593
00:33:43,837 --> 00:33:45,862
I just have to be patient
while they find me.

594
00:33:45,939 --> 00:33:48,339
Did you know that Willie's mom
left him that building?

595
00:33:48,409 --> 00:33:50,138
So he pays no rent.

596
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:54,078
You... and I'm
just guessing here...

597
00:33:54,148 --> 00:33:56,582
have a... an investor

598
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:58,083
who pays through the hoo-hoo

599
00:33:58,152 --> 00:34:01,417
for this very pricy locale.

600
00:34:01,488 --> 00:34:03,285
You might as well
just call them and tell them

601
00:34:03,357 --> 00:34:04,847
that you have no idea
what you're doing

602
00:34:04,925 --> 00:34:07,519
and that this is never
gonna work out.

603
00:34:07,594 --> 00:34:08,925
- Oh, no?
- No,

604
00:34:08,996 --> 00:34:11,794
because people don't go
to Flakes to eat cereal.

605
00:34:11,865 --> 00:34:13,526
They can do that at home.

606
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,727
They go there to be a part
of something cool,

607
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:17,293
and they're never
gonna find that here,

608
00:34:17,371 --> 00:34:19,805
no matter
how patient you are.

609
00:34:23,343 --> 00:34:26,608
What do you think?

610
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,375
Oh.

611
00:34:28,449 --> 00:34:32,385
Uh, I think we better
use your real name.

612
00:34:33,387 --> 00:34:35,218
This is my real name.

613
00:34:37,858 --> 00:34:40,725
Then I think we better
make something up.

614
00:34:57,578 --> 00:34:59,170
Hey, hey, hey.

615
00:34:59,246 --> 00:35:01,180
- Initiation time.
- Great.

616
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:13,353
What's she doing?

617
00:35:17,297 --> 00:35:20,027
Making me watch.

618
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:23,399
<i># I took my time #</i>

619
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:27,065
<i># And made a list #</i>

620
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,937
<i># Of all #</i>

621
00:35:29,009 --> 00:35:30,977
<i># The things #</i>

622
00:35:31,044 --> 00:35:33,410
<i># I hate #</i>

623
00:35:34,781 --> 00:35:39,741
<i># You are one #</i>

624
00:35:41,822 --> 00:35:47,226
<i># You are one #</i>

625
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:58,535
- Hey!
- Hey.

626
00:35:58,605 --> 00:36:01,438
- You been in your studio?
- Uh, yeah.

627
00:36:01,508 --> 00:36:04,306
That's great.
Oh, if you have anything

628
00:36:04,378 --> 00:36:07,040
that you'd like to play me,
I would love to hear it.

629
00:36:07,114 --> 00:36:09,139
When it's ready.

630
00:36:10,484 --> 00:36:12,349
Listen, about that "firing you" thing...

631
00:36:12,419 --> 00:36:15,013
Oh, it's fine.
I got another job.

632
00:36:15,088 --> 00:36:18,182
Is that a problem?
'Cause it's just a job.

633
00:36:18,258 --> 00:36:21,022
Just like you working at Flakes.

634

Shit, you're eating them?

635
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,123
- Sing the song again.
- Mm-mm.

636
00:36:55,195 --> 00:36:57,390
Come on, man.
At least fix me up a bowl, then.

637
00:36:57,464 --> 00:36:59,523
- Mm-mm.
- Neal.

638
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,364
Neal, come here.
She's doing something.

639
00:37:02,402 --> 00:37:04,632
With plants.

640
00:37:04,705 --> 00:37:08,232
- It's temporary.
- Huh?

641
00:37:08,308 --> 00:37:10,936
Don't sound temporary
to me, Magoo.

642
00:37:11,011 --> 00:37:13,275
Come on, man.
Dose me up with some Freakies.

643
00:37:13,347 --> 00:37:14,837
Here.

644
00:37:15,949 --> 00:37:17,883
Eat this.

645
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:21,511

Oh, come on, man!

646

I need the Freakies!

I'll give you that. I just...

Yeah. Thanks.

- Bad idea.

- Go back inside.
- Hear me out.

No. We didn't... We...

that we can do.

792
00:45:14,661 --> 00:45:16,891
Oh, my, my, my.

793
00:45:16,963 --> 00:45:18,590
That was the stupidest...

794
00:45:18,665 --> 00:45:20,496
way the stupidest stunt

795
00:45:20,567 --> 00:45:22,159
you've ever pulled.

796
00:45:22,235 --> 00:45:24,897
Vintage Neal Downs lunacy.

797
00:45:24,971 --> 00:45:26,939
Yes, it was pretty fucked up.

798
00:45:27,006 --> 00:45:28,598
Yes, it was.

799
00:45:28,675 --> 00:45:31,508
Brilliant, inspired stupidity.

800
00:45:31,578 --> 00:45:34,411
Oh. Plus, between
you two morons,

801
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:36,608
some very poor people got fed today.

802
00:45:36,683 --> 00:45:39,174
That was beautiful.

803
00:45:39,252 --> 00:45:42,847
God, Neal, if you could ever
harness that kind of madness

804
00:45:42,922 --> 00:45:45,482
- in your art instead of that cereal shop...
- Oh, God.

805
00:45:45,558 --> 00:45:49,358
For your information,
Miss Harpy Nag,

806
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:53,694
I hired someone
to do just that today.

807
00:45:55,301 --> 00:45:56,791
What? You re...

808
00:45:56,870 --> 00:45:58,804
You really...
You really hired someone?

809
00:45:58,872 --> 00:46:01,033
Did I stutter?

810
00:46:01,107 --> 00:46:02,335
Who?

811
00:46:02,408 --> 00:46:04,603
That Strawberry chick.

812
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:08,572
Baby Spice?

813
00:46:08,648 --> 00:46:11,674
Oh, come on.
Listen to you, hypocrite,

814
00:46:11,751 --> 00:46:14,879
with your little Stuey
to keep you company, huh?

815
00:46:14,954 --> 00:46:16,683
That is not what that is like.

816
00:46:16,756 --> 00:46:18,883
Oh, Miss P, you put
trees outside my store.

817
00:46:18,958 --> 00:46:21,017
- Stuart is not... Shut up.
- I love you so much!

818
00:46:21,094 --> 00:46:22,755
Okay, look, you're right.

819
00:46:22,829 --> 00:46:25,093
As long as you're doing
your week, that's all that matters.

820
00:46:25,165 --> 00:46:27,030
- Yeah.
- You are doing your week, right?

821
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:28,761
- Yes, I'm doing my week.
- Good.

822
00:46:28,835 --> 00:46:30,700
- So you can quit now, right?
- Right.

823
00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:33,568
- Good. Ow!
- Don't take my stuff without asking, you turd!

824
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:35,437
What is your problem?
Get off me.

825
00:46:35,508 --> 00:46:37,169
Get back, too, huh?
Ow! Ow!

826
00:46:37,243 --> 00:46:39,211
Too hard. I'm a girl.
Get away.

827
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:44,483
Here you go.

828
00:46:45,618 --> 00:46:48,109
Ta-da!

829
00:46:48,188 --> 00:46:50,713
You can go now if you want.
I think I got the hang of it.

830
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:53,554
- You sure?
- Yeah. It's cool.

831
00:46:53,626 --> 00:46:56,789
Okay. Make sure you keep
an eye out across the street.

832
00:46:56,863 --> 00:46:59,764
If you see any more than 50 people
in there at a time, call the fire marshal.

833
00:46:59,832 --> 00:47:01,732
It's illegal.
I left the number by the phone.

834
00:47:01,801 --> 00:47:02,893
Got it.

835
00:47:03,937 --> 00:47:07,634
Neal, have you done inventory?

836
00:47:07,707 --> 00:47:09,766
- What?
- Inventory!

837
00:47:09,842 --> 00:47:12,106
Th-That's when you count stuff, man.

838
00:47:12,178 --> 00:47:14,840
And... And no more refills.

839
00:47:14,914 --> 00:47:17,144
You hear that? No more refills.

840
00:47:17,217 --> 00:47:19,845
This doesn't grow on trees,
you know.

841
00:47:19,919 --> 00:47:22,615
You... You don't work here.

842
00:47:22,689 --> 00:47:24,623
Yeah, I do.

843
00:47:24,691 --> 00:47:26,352
We can't afford that.

844
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:27,688
She works for free.

845
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:30,456
- I don't care. Out! Out!
- Okay. Sorry.

846
00:47:31,531 --> 00:47:33,396
Willie, what is that?

847
00:47:33,466 --> 00:47:36,697
It's toilet paper. I got it from
the Burger King on the way from the bank.

848
00:47:36,769 --> 00:47:38,236
You were at a bank?

849
00:47:39,472 --> 00:47:41,531
Twice.

850
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:45,009
I sat at the desk, too,
not the counter.

851
00:47:48,982 --> 00:47:51,542
I talked to the manager.

852
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:54,348
They're gonna seize your assets.

853
00:47:57,490 --> 00:48:00,254
No, no, no, no, no. You can't quit.

854
00:48:00,326 --> 00:48:02,760
We just started. Look at what
you've already done here.

855
00:48:02,829 --> 00:48:04,922
- Is that a new shirt?
- What?

856
00:48:04,998 --> 00:48:07,228
Look, this sketch...
I love this.

857
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:09,495
You know, I took art history class,
and I know good art.

858
00:48:09,569 --> 00:48:11,503
This is really, really good.

859
00:48:11,571 --> 00:48:14,768
Look, okay, I was gonna
say this before, I swear.

860
00:48:14,841 --> 00:48:16,706
I want you to bring
your work here.

861
00:48:16,776 --> 00:48:19,574
You know, you can make this,
like, your gallery.

862
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:22,137
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What do you think?

863
00:48:23,816 --> 00:48:25,750
I think it looks better.

864
00:48:25,818 --> 00:48:28,753
No, I meant about
the gallery thing.

865
00:48:28,821 --> 00:48:31,255
I know what you meant.

866
00:48:35,361 --> 00:48:37,693
Those bastards stole my life.

867
00:48:37,764 --> 00:48:40,028
They stole my whole gig, man.

868
00:48:40,099 --> 00:48:41,896
The name, everything.

869
00:48:41,968 --> 00:48:43,458
You know who's over there now?

870
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:46,563
Everyone.

871
00:48:46,639 --> 00:48:49,107
A bunch of high school kids
and tourists,

872
00:48:49,175 --> 00:48:52,167
a bunch of punks,
normal-looking guys.

873
00:48:52,245 --> 00:48:54,770
A woman that Skinny Larry
says is his mom...

874
00:48:54,847 --> 00:48:56,712
She's over there right now.

875
00:48:56,783 --> 00:48:58,546
- That is his mom.
- Whatever.

876
00:48:58,618 --> 00:49:01,451
She's eating Special K
out of a fucking bathtub.

877
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:04,046
Got to be
a whole box in there!

878
00:49:04,123 --> 00:49:06,683
How could you let
this happen, Neal?

879
00:49:06,759 --> 00:49:08,693
- Me?
- You're the manager!

880
00:49:08,761 --> 00:49:12,128
Because one day, you said,
"Hey, Neal, be the manager."

881
00:49:13,333 --> 00:49:14,891
You, Bob...

882
00:49:14,967 --> 00:49:15,991
Tom.

883
00:49:16,069 --> 00:49:18,037
T-Tom.

884
00:49:18,104 --> 00:49:19,969
You're a lawyer, aren't you?

885
00:49:20,039 --> 00:49:21,529
You're a lawyer?

886
00:49:23,609 --> 00:49:25,474
Let's sue him.
Can we do that?

887
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:27,877
Don't even joke about that, Willie.
We're stronger than that, man.

888
00:49:27,947 --> 00:49:31,314
Come on, Tom. Say we can
sue him. Identity theft, right?

889
00:49:31,384 --> 00:49:33,682
That's possible.

890
00:49:33,753 --> 00:49:36,449
I'll have to look it up
in, you know,

891
00:49:36,522 --> 00:49:39,218
<i>the Louisiana Code
of Civil Procedures.</i>

892
00:49:39,292 --> 00:49:40,657
Yes, look it up, man.
Look it up.

893
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:42,820
I don't have
those books anymore.

894
00:49:42,895 --> 00:49:45,659
Doesn't Loyola have
a fucking library?

895
00:49:52,538 --> 00:49:54,369
I'm gonna die.

896
00:49:56,709 --> 00:49:58,574
- I'm gonna die.
- Come on, man.

897
00:49:58,644 --> 00:50:02,341
You're not gonna die, Willie.
You're gonna be fine.

898
00:50:02,415 --> 00:50:05,680
Maybe I should
just close down.

899
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:07,014
What?

900
00:50:08,321 --> 00:50:11,518
No, that's crazy talk.
You can't close down.

901
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:14,082
Everything's gonna be fine.

902
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,594
All right.
I'm gonna handle this.

903
00:50:16,662 --> 00:50:18,960
Nicholas, score Willie a joint.

904
00:50:19,031 --> 00:50:22,262
Mr. Tom, you come with me.

905
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:24,235
Now, listen, this guy Stuart's just

906
00:50:24,303 --> 00:50:25,964
a little grad school pussy, okay?

907
00:50:26,038 --> 00:50:27,903
So just say a bunch
of law shit to him,

908
00:50:27,974 --> 00:50:29,942
sound serious and threatening.

909
00:50:30,009 --> 00:50:32,477
I can't believe
I'm touching a lawyer.

910
00:50:32,545 --> 00:50:34,410
All right, Mr. Tom.
This is your chance to atone

911
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,779
- for all those years of practice...
- Six months.

912
00:50:39,385 --> 00:50:42,354
Six months of practice
as an ambulance-chasing weasel.

913
00:50:53,699 --> 00:50:55,291
Okay, old-timer.

914
00:50:55,368 --> 00:50:57,928
You pull this off,
free cereal for life.

915
00:50:58,004 --> 00:51:01,269
Hell, if you pull this off,
I'll even buy you a sombrero.

916
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:03,433
But I don't think
I want my artwork used

917
00:51:03,509 --> 00:51:05,909
as a marketing tool
for a cereal shop.

918
00:51:05,978 --> 00:51:07,912
See, that's what
I don't understand.

919
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:10,778
To me, it's, like, things are either
for sale or they're not for sale.

920
00:51:10,850 --> 00:51:13,318
And I really think
we can sell your stuff.

921
00:51:13,386 --> 00:51:15,854
Stuart, this is Willie's attorney,

922
00:51:15,922 --> 00:51:17,184
and he has something that he'd like...

923
00:51:17,256 --> 00:51:20,191
T-Tom. Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom.
Come on.

924
00:51:22,261 --> 00:51:24,855
He has something
he'd like to tell you.

925
00:51:31,938 --> 00:51:34,304
Hi. Stuart Zeringue the 4th.

926
00:51:34,373 --> 00:51:36,898
You're a lawyer? Maybe you know
my father, Tre Zeringue?

927
00:51:36,976 --> 00:51:38,910
Riley, Zeringue & Carmouche?

928
00:51:38,978 --> 00:51:40,570
Ooh.

929
00:51:40,646 --> 00:51:42,739
I already have a sombrero.

930
00:51:44,417 --> 00:51:46,977
A what?

931
00:51:47,053 --> 00:51:48,918
What the fuck are you
still doing here?

932
00:51:48,988 --> 00:51:50,012
What are you doing here?

933
00:51:50,089 --> 00:51:53,388
You're supposed to be working
on your CD in your studio, Neal.

934
00:51:54,927 --> 00:51:57,589
Her name's Rachel.

935
00:51:57,663 --> 00:52:01,030
Rachel Irene Katz.

936
00:52:02,668 --> 00:52:05,398
And your daddy
probably knows her daddy.

937
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:12,837
Did you say a gallery?

938
00:52:14,247 --> 00:52:17,080
<i># Ten turns against me #</i>

939
00:52:17,149 --> 00:52:20,744
<i># And you've gone #</i>

940
00:52:22,054 --> 00:52:28,050
<i># I put your favorite records on #</i>

941
00:52:29,929 --> 00:52:33,387
<i># And sit around #</i>

942
00:52:33,466 --> 00:52:36,867
<i># It spins around #</i>

943
00:52:36,936 --> 00:52:42,568
<i># And you're around again #</i>

944
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:55,218
<i># Cue every memory
at half-speed #</i>

945
00:52:55,288 --> 00:52:57,722
<i># It's Just like #</i>

946
00:52:57,790 --> 00:53:01,385
<i>- Oh, fuck.
- # Try and slow me down #</i>

947
00:53:02,828 --> 00:53:06,025
Come on, Willie!
You promised me!

948
00:53:24,850 --> 00:53:26,010
I'm just afraid there might be

949
00:53:26,085 --> 00:53:28,280
a conflict of interest here.

950
00:53:28,354 --> 00:53:29,480
No, it's not a problem.

951
00:53:29,555 --> 00:53:30,988
We keep our private
lives separate.

952
00:53:31,057 --> 00:53:33,082
It's just a job.

953
00:53:33,159 --> 00:53:35,889
Okay, but this is not Flakes.

954
00:53:35,962 --> 00:53:38,931
Here, we keep track
of hours and inventory

955
00:53:38,998 --> 00:53:40,932
and portion control.

956
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,230
And you have to wear a hat.

957
00:53:43,302 --> 00:53:44,735
It's a health code requirement.

958
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:46,669
We'll get you a little name tag.

959
00:53:46,739 --> 00:53:49,173
And... rubber gloves

960
00:53:49,241 --> 00:53:51,471
for whenever
you handle the product.

961
00:53:52,878 --> 00:53:55,176
You know, there's
one more thing, too, Neal.

962
00:53:55,247 --> 00:53:58,307
When you were at Flakes,
you were rude

963
00:53:58,384 --> 00:54:01,649
and self-righteous and sarcastic

964
00:54:01,721 --> 00:54:04,622
and full of all that antiestablishment talk.

965
00:54:04,690 --> 00:54:06,715
You know, "fight the power"

966
00:54:06,792 --> 00:54:08,919
and all that?

967
00:54:10,563 --> 00:54:12,497
Do that here.

968
00:54:16,669 --> 00:54:18,603
It sells.

969
00:54:25,044 --> 00:54:27,444
- Your change.
- Thanks.

970
00:54:35,988 --> 00:54:37,387
Hi, Feral.

971
00:54:42,628 --> 00:54:44,926
What are you doing here?

972
00:54:44,997 --> 00:54:47,227
Same as you.
Just needed a job, you know?

973
00:54:47,299 --> 00:54:50,132
Now that Flakes is closed down.

974
00:54:50,202 --> 00:54:52,727
What is this, the new special?
You buy three bowls of cereal,

975
00:54:52,805 --> 00:54:55,467
get a free Miss P. art smock?

976
00:54:55,541 --> 00:54:57,702
I can't look at you
in that hat.

977
00:54:57,777 --> 00:55:00,405
Oh, will you excuse me
for a moment?

978
00:55:00,479 --> 00:55:03,039
Good morning, ma'am.

979
00:55:03,115 --> 00:55:05,242
- Good morning.
- Can I help you?

980
00:55:05,317 --> 00:55:08,343
Yes. I would like the Mix-a-Bunch
with double maple granola,

981
00:55:08,421 --> 00:55:10,912
skim milk and crumpled
boysenberry crumble.

982
00:55:10,990 --> 00:55:12,821
- Excellent choice.
- Thank you.

983
00:55:36,215 --> 00:55:39,207
There you are. Enjoy.

984
00:55:39,285 --> 00:55:41,276
Keep the change.

985
00:55:41,353 --> 00:55:43,981
Thank you very much.

986
00:55:45,391 --> 00:55:47,325
- Hello, Mr. Zeringue.
- How we doing over here, guys?

987
00:55:47,393 --> 00:55:49,327
I meant to tell you,
silica packets

988
00:55:49,395 --> 00:55:51,693
in the bulk containers
will help keep things crunchy.

989
00:55:51,764 --> 00:55:54,358
They use them in electronics gear
to keep them dry.

990
00:55:54,433 --> 00:55:56,367
Will used to get them
in old stereo boxes,

991
00:55:56,435 --> 00:55:58,596
but I'm sure you'll
just want to buy some.

992
00:55:58,671 --> 00:56:01,538
Good looking out, Neal.
Big help. Thanks.

993
00:56:11,016 --> 00:56:13,109
And based on her energy,

994
00:56:13,185 --> 00:56:14,880
commitment, and leadership skills,

995
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:16,785
I'd like to announce
that Feral is going to be

996
00:56:16,856 --> 00:56:19,120
our first assistant manager.

997
00:56:26,198 --> 00:56:28,530
So, effective...

998
00:56:30,202 --> 00:56:32,102
Effective immediately,

999
00:56:32,171 --> 00:56:34,230
she will be responsible for staffing,

1000
00:56:34,306 --> 00:56:35,898
promotions, inventory.

1001
00:56:35,975 --> 00:56:38,205
Basically, as much of my job
as I can dump on her.

1002
00:56:48,087 --> 00:56:51,113
So, that's basically all, um...

1003
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:52,782
all...

1004
00:56:52,858 --> 00:56:54,792
Uh, meeting adjourned.

1005
00:57:00,032 --> 00:57:02,000
Neal.

1006
00:57:03,302 --> 00:57:05,566
Can you come here
for a second?

1007
00:57:05,638 --> 00:57:07,868
<i>Jawohll</i>

1008
00:57:13,913 --> 00:57:15,403
You're fired.

1009
00:57:31,764 --> 00:57:35,757
Nooo! No!

1010
00:57:37,536 --> 00:57:39,868
You owe me $86.38, Neal!

1011
00:57:39,939 --> 00:57:42,567
Fuck off, Benedict!

1012
00:57:53,986 --> 00:57:57,752
Neal! Neal, I got in!

1013
00:57:57,823 --> 00:58:00,553
Loyola Jazz Studies program, man.
I got in!

1014
00:58:00,626 --> 00:58:02,617
I fucking got in!

1015
00:58:04,296 --> 00:58:06,787
That's great, man.
You can do weddings now.

1016
00:58:06,866 --> 00:58:08,766
Yeah, weddings
and Bar Mitzvahs and shit!

1017
00:58:08,834 --> 00:58:10,165
Dude, I'm gonna play
everywhere.

1018
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:12,500
I'm gonna play till
my fuckin' arms fall off.

1019
00:58:12,571 --> 00:58:15,131
I'm gonna go let people know.
Later, man!

1020
00:58:26,118 --> 00:58:27,449
What?

1021
00:58:28,821 --> 00:58:31,813
I made 200 bucks for being
employee of the month today.

1022
00:58:34,326 --> 00:58:37,818
I would like you to blow it all with me
in a very fancy restaurant.

1023
00:58:39,732 --> 00:58:43,293
I was thinking, mmm, Antoine's.

1024
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:09,894
Better?

1025
00:59:09,962 --> 00:59:11,987
It's an old high school trick
I learned.

1026
00:59:12,064 --> 00:59:14,624
Do that first on the date,
and everything else seems easy.

1027
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:16,361
That was nice.

1028
00:59:16,435 --> 00:59:18,335
<i>Des huitres en coquille
 la Rockefeller.</i>

1029
00:59:18,404 --> 00:59:21,532
<i>Magnifique.</i>

1030
00:59:23,542 --> 00:59:26,602
Mmm! Those dead snails
look divine.

1031
00:59:28,681 --> 00:59:30,478
<i>Les Escargots a la Bourguignonne.</i>

1032
00:59:31,583 --> 00:59:33,608
We use the little
Barbie forks for these?

1033
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:37,279
Uh, Enrique, one more thing.

1034
00:59:38,624 --> 00:59:40,489
I heard a rumor
that fat cats come in here

1035
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:41,992
and use a secret code

1036
00:59:42,061 --> 00:59:44,928
to order pitchers of martinis
disguised as water.

1037
00:59:44,997 --> 00:59:47,022
True?

1038
00:59:47,099 --> 00:59:49,590
I really couldn't say.

1039
00:59:52,037 --> 00:59:53,527
How's the firewater, boys?

1040
01:00:02,982 --> 01:00:04,609
Cheers.

1041
01:00:04,683 --> 01:00:07,311
Cheers.

1042
01:00:15,694 --> 01:00:18,891
Mmm! Man, that's good.

1043
01:00:18,964 --> 01:00:20,397
How is yours?

1044
01:00:20,466 --> 01:00:22,263
It's great.

1045
01:00:22,334 --> 01:00:23,631
I mean, the fish is amazing.

1046
01:00:23,702 --> 01:00:25,829
But buried under a pound
of crab and shrimp,

1047
01:00:25,904 --> 01:00:27,166
it's out of fucking control.

1048
01:00:33,445 --> 01:00:36,744
- Hey, Neal.
- Mm-hmm?

1049
01:00:36,815 --> 01:00:39,716
You know how we talked
about the Airstream...

1050
01:00:39,785 --> 01:00:41,878
rock and roll cult leader
and art legend?

1051
01:00:41,954 --> 01:00:43,421
Mm-hmm.

1052
01:00:43,489 --> 01:00:46,049
You understand that that's a plan.

1053
01:00:46,125 --> 01:00:47,786
That's not a fantasy.

1054
01:00:50,329 --> 01:00:53,526
I know... that I screwed
some stuff up.

1055
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:55,965
- But...
- It's okay.

1056
01:00:56,035 --> 01:00:57,969
I can get another job.

1057
01:00:58,037 --> 01:00:59,800
What?

1058
01:00:59,872 --> 01:01:02,102
I can have another one tomorrow.
It's just a job.

1059
01:01:02,174 --> 01:01:04,267
Stop saying that!

1060
01:01:04,343 --> 01:01:05,833
There's no such thing
as just a job.

1061
01:01:05,911 --> 01:01:07,845
Anything that takes up your time
takes up your life.

1062
01:01:07,913 --> 01:01:10,404
What if you never do anything
that you think is important?

1063
01:01:10,482 --> 01:01:12,416
Oh, what? Like you?
You think you're gonna

1064
01:01:12,484 --> 01:01:14,418
become an art legend
selling fuckin' souvenirs?

1065
01:01:14,486 --> 01:01:17,216
Next, you're gonna be gluing
googly eyes onto conch shells

1066
01:01:17,289 --> 01:01:19,780
with the New Original logo
"We crushed the little guy."

1067
01:01:19,858 --> 01:01:22,622
You killed Flakes!
You're a fuckin' sellout!

1068
01:01:22,694 --> 01:01:24,127
I said I screwed
some stuff up!

1069
01:01:24,196 --> 01:01:26,187
I just thought that
if Flakes was gone, that...

1070
01:01:26,265 --> 01:01:29,291
You know what? At least I'm trying.
Are you trying anything?

1071
01:01:29,368 --> 01:01:32,030
How are you supposed to get to the dream,
Neal, if you don't try anything?

1072
01:01:32,104 --> 01:01:34,470
Have you committed
one note, one word?

1073
01:01:34,540 --> 01:01:36,405
Hell, yes!
Fuck, yes, I have!

1074
01:01:36,475 --> 01:01:39,535
- Well, then, play me a song!
- Well, then, bring me a guitar!

1075
01:01:41,213 --> 01:01:43,147
I'll cancel the desserts for you.

1076
01:01:44,216 --> 01:01:45,877
Good night.

1077
01:01:48,887 --> 01:01:50,821
Thank you, Enrique.

1078
01:02:01,166 --> 01:02:03,396
Oh, man.

1079
01:02:03,469 --> 01:02:06,461
Whoo! We got kicked out
of Antoine's.

1080
01:02:06,538 --> 01:02:09,200
Right on.

1081
01:02:10,876 --> 01:02:13,606
Oh.

1082
01:02:13,679 --> 01:02:16,079
Oh, so you think I've just been
fucking around all this time,

1083
01:02:16,148 --> 01:02:19,083
- and I got nothing, huh?
- No. l... No.

1084
01:02:19,151 --> 01:02:21,142
I think it's really hard
to drag something

1085
01:02:21,220 --> 01:02:23,211
out of yourself
and show it to someone.

1086
01:02:31,296 --> 01:02:33,161
Oh.

1087
01:02:34,166 --> 01:02:35,656
Oh, God.

1088
01:02:35,734 --> 01:02:37,668
I didn't mean to do this now.

1089
01:02:37,736 --> 01:02:40,500
l... Maybe I did. I don't know.

1090
01:02:40,572 --> 01:02:44,804
But, um, I can't keep waiting.

1091
01:02:45,944 --> 01:02:49,175
Well... Well, wait a minute.

1092
01:02:49,248 --> 01:02:51,113
What are you talking about?

1093
01:02:51,183 --> 01:02:53,481
What the hell happened to all
that "I'm so committed" stuff?

1094
01:02:53,552 --> 01:02:57,113
I don't know.

1095
01:02:59,057 --> 01:03:01,924
I don't know.

1096
01:03:04,029 --> 01:03:06,054
Oh.

1097
01:03:06,131 --> 01:03:08,122
Are you... Are you okay?

1098
01:03:09,535 --> 01:03:11,298
- What?
- Oh, fuck.

1099
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:13,531
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- No, it's not that.

1100
01:03:13,605 --> 01:03:16,938
I'm not used to all that meat
and butter and shit.

1101
01:03:17,009 --> 01:03:19,671
That's because
you only eat cereal!

1102
01:03:19,745 --> 01:03:21,406
It's not food!

1103
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:22,879
It's baby food.

1104
01:03:22,948 --> 01:03:25,542
Oh, God, you want me to grow up?
Is that what this is all about?

1105
01:03:25,617 --> 01:03:27,710
No, no, I don't want that.

1106
01:03:27,786 --> 01:03:30,653
I don't ever want that.
I just want you to grow.

1107
01:03:31,757 --> 01:03:33,782
I'm sorry
to disappoint you again.

1108
01:03:35,928 --> 01:03:37,691
Fuck you, Mr. Downs.

1109
01:03:37,763 --> 01:03:40,630
Fuck you
for breaking my heart!

1110
01:03:58,584 --> 01:04:00,074
P?

1111
01:04:02,788 --> 01:04:04,278
P.

1112
01:04:06,225 --> 01:04:07,988
Wait a minute.

1113
01:04:08,060 --> 01:04:10,858
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait a minute.

1114
01:04:10,929 --> 01:04:13,830
I got... I got something
I want you to hear.

1115
01:04:13,899 --> 01:04:15,924
I got 10 songs here
I've been working on.

1116
01:04:16,001 --> 01:04:18,026
You think I've been working
on nothing, huh?

1117
01:04:18,103 --> 01:04:20,401
I want you
to listen to this.

1118
01:04:20,472 --> 01:04:22,064
Wait a minute.

1119
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:24,131
Hey!

1120
01:04:24,209 --> 01:04:25,904
Don't go.

1121
01:04:25,978 --> 01:04:27,878
Do not go!

1122
01:04:27,946 --> 01:04:29,971
Fuck!

1123
01:04:33,719 --> 01:04:35,277
Listen.

1124
01:04:37,923 --> 01:04:39,754
Listen!

1125
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:43,625
You wanted me
to play you a song!

1126
01:04:43,695 --> 01:04:45,686
I'm playing you a song!

1127
01:05:06,418 --> 01:05:08,283
Shut up!

1128
01:05:26,338 --> 01:05:28,306
<i># I sit around #</i>

1129
01:05:28,373 --> 01:05:30,739
<i># Nothing's the same #</i>

1130
01:05:30,809 --> 01:05:33,209
<i># I'm lookin' for answers #</i>

1131
01:05:33,278 --> 01:05:36,611
<i># But I'm already late #</i>

1132
01:05:36,682 --> 01:05:40,812
<i># You say you need me
one more night #</i>

1133
01:05:40,886 --> 01:05:43,616
<i># And then you're
packing your bags #</i>

1134
01:05:43,689 --> 01:05:47,318
<i># Saying, "It's all right" #</i>

1135
01:05:47,392 --> 01:05:49,519
<i># I don't know why #</i>

1136
01:05:49,594 --> 01:05:52,461
<i># I wait and I wait #</i>

1137
01:05:52,531 --> 01:05:54,499

1138
01:05:54,566 --> 01:05:57,933

1139
01:05:58,003 --> 01:06:02,201

1140
01:06:02,274 --> 01:06:05,072

1141
01:06:08,780 --> 01:06:12,739
<i># I turn around

1142
01:06:12,818 --> 01:06:16,879
<i># Now you've gone away #</i>

1143
01:07:50,382 --> 01:07:53,044
Willie!

1144
01:07:53,118 --> 01:07:55,484
Willie, open up!

1145
01:07:59,958 --> 01:08:03,121
This shit really isn't very good.

1146
01:08:03,195 --> 01:08:04,753
I'm trying to finish up
all the milk

1147
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:06,889
so it won't go to waste.

1148
01:08:06,965 --> 01:08:09,297
I need all the paperwork
for Flakes.

1149
01:08:11,102 --> 01:08:13,935
I'm taking the Maypo.

1150
01:08:14,005 --> 01:08:15,939
Let me know if
there's anything you want,

1151
01:08:16,007 --> 01:08:17,941
before I let Bruce look it over.

1152
01:08:18,009 --> 01:08:21,240
Don't let Bruce look
anything over. Not yet.

1153
01:08:21,313 --> 01:08:22,507
Come on.
The paperwork, Willie.

1154
01:08:22,581 --> 01:08:23,775
I need, uh,

1155
01:08:23,849 --> 01:08:26,443
incorporation papers,
occupational license,

1156
01:08:26,518 --> 01:08:28,452
taxes for the last two years,

1157
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:30,454
any press clippings you have
about the place.

1158
01:08:30,522 --> 01:08:33,685
Oh, maybe. In my place.

1159
01:08:33,758 --> 01:08:35,953
- Your place?
- Mm-hmm.

1160
01:08:36,027 --> 01:08:37,892
Okay, let's go.

1161
01:08:37,963 --> 01:08:40,523
There's another bag of milk.

1162
01:08:40,599 --> 01:08:42,533
Let it go, man.

1163
01:08:46,605 --> 01:08:48,470
What are we doing?

1164
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:51,065
We ain't letting Flakes die
without a fight.

1165
01:08:51,142 --> 01:08:52,734
Where's the papers?

1166
01:08:52,811 --> 01:08:56,144
I don't know.
Probably somewhere.

1167
01:08:56,214 --> 01:08:58,045
In here.

1168
01:09:01,686 --> 01:09:03,745
Aw, shit!

1169
01:09:03,822 --> 01:09:05,983
No wonder we tanked.

1170
01:09:07,492 --> 01:09:10,256
This is sick, man.
You gotta find what's important,

1171
01:09:10,328 --> 01:09:13,627
and then hit the rest of this shit
with some kerosene and a match.

1172
01:09:13,698 --> 01:09:16,758
You're gonna smother
under all this crap.

1173
01:09:16,835 --> 01:09:18,700
All right.
Department of Health.

1174
01:09:18,770 --> 01:09:21,068
This should be
your occupational license,

1175
01:09:21,139 --> 01:09:24,233
which needed to get inspected
once every six months.

1176
01:09:24,309 --> 01:09:25,742
Wow, man.

1177
01:09:25,810 --> 01:09:28,540
When did you get to be
an expert on paperwork, man?

1178
01:09:28,613 --> 01:09:32,379
I'm not. Ashton Hale is.

1179
01:09:35,287 --> 01:09:36,254
Let me get this straight.

1180
01:09:36,321 --> 01:09:38,755
These places
serve breakfast cereal?

1181
01:09:38,823 --> 01:09:40,757
Corn Flakes, Total, shit like that?

1182
01:09:40,825 --> 01:09:43,157
I'll be damned.

1183
01:09:43,228 --> 01:09:47,722
And you're telling me that
Tre Zeringue's boy runs the other place?

1184
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:51,132
Oh, man,
am I gonna love this.

1185
01:09:51,202 --> 01:09:54,694
Okay.
Here's our game plan.

1186
01:09:54,773 --> 01:09:57,401
We're gonna lob a temporary
restraining order at him.

1187
01:09:57,475 --> 01:09:59,602
Now, it won't hold.
But it'll really piss him off.

1188
01:09:59,678 --> 01:10:01,202
And when Junior gets the TRO,

1189
01:10:01,279 --> 01:10:02,712
well, he's gonna
show it to Daddy.

1190
01:10:02,781 --> 01:10:04,476
And when Daddy
sees my name on it,

1191
01:10:04,549 --> 01:10:07,040
you can bet your left nut he's gonna
pick up the phone and give me a jingle,

1192
01:10:07,118 --> 01:10:10,110
because he doesn't want this
going to court.

1193
01:10:10,188 --> 01:10:12,486
I mean, no offense,
but to him, this is chickenshit.

1194
01:10:12,557 --> 01:10:14,957
This is so beneath him,
he's just gonna wanna settle.

1195
01:10:15,026 --> 01:10:16,891
Well, I'm gonna tell him,
"Hell, no,"

1196
01:10:16,962 --> 01:10:19,396
'cause he still owes me
for that big 'Bama/LSU game.

1197
01:10:19,464 --> 01:10:22,922
And then I'll tell him, "Well, we're
gonna think about arbitration."

1198
01:10:23,001 --> 01:10:25,868
And, uh...
You know what arbitration is?

1199
01:10:27,238 --> 01:10:28,603
Oh.

1200
01:10:28,673 --> 01:10:31,233
It's kind of like pretend court.

1201
01:10:31,309 --> 01:10:32,799
You get everybody in a room.

1202
01:10:32,877 --> 01:10:34,435
It's like you have a trial

1203
01:10:34,512 --> 01:10:36,002
without all the bullshit of a trial.

1204
01:10:36,081 --> 01:10:38,072
But everything is still
legally binding, okay?

1205
01:10:38,149 --> 01:10:40,845
Yeah, and everyone
has to be there,

1206
01:10:40,919 --> 01:10:42,181
whether they wanna
be there or not.

1207
01:10:42,253 --> 01:10:44,050
Oh, yeah. If we call them,
they have to be there.

1208
01:10:44,122 --> 01:10:46,215
- Yeah, well,
- Thank you.

1209
01:10:46,291 --> 01:10:49,021
we should talk to our lawyer.

1210
01:10:50,328 --> 01:10:52,421
Yeah, the man
who recommended you

1211
01:10:52,497 --> 01:10:54,897
is also a lawyer, sort of.

1212
01:10:54,966 --> 01:10:56,399
Name?

1213
01:10:56,468 --> 01:10:59,062
Tom. Tom... something.

1214
01:10:59,137 --> 01:11:00,570
- Guidry?
- Uh, yeah.

1215
01:11:01,573 --> 01:11:02,904
Old Tommy Guidry?

1216
01:11:05,543 --> 01:11:08,103
My dad tried his first case
against him with the D.A.

1217
01:11:08,179 --> 01:11:10,044
Handed him his ass.

1218
01:11:10,115 --> 01:11:12,208
That's probably why
he recommended us to you.

1219
01:11:12,283 --> 01:11:14,444
Oh, yeah. It's kind of like
a legend in my family.

1220
01:11:14,519 --> 01:11:16,714
The dad my daddy beat
the smartest man in Louisiana.

1221
01:11:16,788 --> 01:11:20,121
Oh, yeah. Old Tommy.
He's smarter than hell.

1222
01:11:20,191 --> 01:11:23,490
Yeah.
But having a 300 IQ

1223
01:11:23,561 --> 01:11:25,461
is kind of like having
a 20-inch dick.

1224
01:11:25,530 --> 01:11:27,259
You know what I mean?
It's real impressive,

1225
01:11:27,332 --> 01:11:28,799
but when you get right down to it,

1226
01:11:28,867 --> 01:11:30,095
there's not a whole lot of it

1227
01:11:30,168 --> 01:11:31,692
you can actually use.

1228
01:11:34,339 --> 01:11:36,534
You're part of
the N.O. Flakes team.

1229
01:11:36,608 --> 01:11:39,338
We need these. We need you.

1230
01:11:39,411 --> 01:11:41,538
What do you want? I can get you
anything you want. A loan...

1231
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:44,007
Stuart Zeringue.

1232
01:11:44,082 --> 01:11:45,947
Yeah.

1233
01:11:47,085 --> 01:11:49,019
Sign by your name.

1234
01:11:55,727 --> 01:11:57,752
It's a temporary restraining order.

1235
01:12:00,265 --> 01:12:02,790
Oh, my God.
They hired Ashton Hale.

1236
01:12:02,867 --> 01:12:05,495
He's like a $300-an-hour
legal assassin.

1237
01:12:05,570 --> 01:12:08,232
Do you know anything
about this?

1238
01:12:10,442 --> 01:12:13,377
Oh, my dad is gonna
have an aneurysm.

1239
01:12:13,445 --> 01:12:17,347
Do you know where I can find
a Miss Pussy Katz?

1240
01:12:30,462 --> 01:12:31,895
Stuey.

1241
01:12:31,963 --> 01:12:33,453
Hey, Dad.

1242
01:12:34,766 --> 01:12:36,859
Tuck your shirt in, son.

1243
01:12:36,935 --> 01:12:38,994
Tre, how are you?
Good to see you.

1244
01:12:39,070 --> 01:12:40,537
This makes us "even Steven"

1245
01:12:40,605 --> 01:12:41,629
on the LSU bet,

1246
01:12:41,706 --> 01:12:43,139
you big 'Bama bastard.

1247
01:12:43,208 --> 01:12:45,142
"Roll Tide."

1248
01:12:45,210 --> 01:12:46,177
Are we seriously doing this

1249
01:12:46,244 --> 01:12:48,178
over a goddamn breakfast
cereal restaurant?

1250
01:12:48,246 --> 01:12:50,407
You own it.

1251
01:12:52,083 --> 01:12:54,017
- You open, Mr. Hale.
- Thank you.

1252
01:12:55,086 --> 01:12:56,747
This is
a pretty straightforward

1253
01:12:56,821 --> 01:12:58,812
trademark and copyright
infringement.

1254
01:12:58,890 --> 01:13:02,326
Uh, Mr. Willie Bergeron here
developed the concept,

1255
01:13:02,393 --> 01:13:05,692
the name Flakes,
the atmosphere, everything.

1256
01:13:05,764 --> 01:13:07,664
And then Tre's boy...

1257
01:13:07,732 --> 01:13:09,029
sorry, client...

1258
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:10,761
appropriated it all

1259
01:13:10,835 --> 01:13:12,427
and opened a duplicate
across the street

1260
01:13:12,504 --> 01:13:13,869
in order to capitalize

1261
01:13:13,938 --> 01:13:15,633
on an established
business concern

1262
01:13:15,707 --> 01:13:16,765
and its clientele.

1263
01:13:16,841 --> 01:13:18,672
So we'll be seeking
a name change

1264
01:13:18,743 --> 01:13:21,268
and a cash settlement
for revenues lost.

1265
01:13:21,346 --> 01:13:23,541
Trademark
and copyright papers?

1266
01:13:23,615 --> 01:13:26,413
Don't need them.
We have ownership from creation.

1267
01:13:26,484 --> 01:13:28,042
Well, the statutes are vague,

1268
01:13:28,119 --> 01:13:30,212
and we found
no relevant precedents.

1269
01:13:30,288 --> 01:13:32,051
<i>Vortolon vs. Clemens.</i>

1270
01:13:32,123 --> 01:13:34,250
Full-weight brand coffee brought suit

1271
01:13:34,325 --> 01:13:37,260
against full major brand and won.

1272
01:13:37,328 --> 01:13:38,989
1932.

1273
01:13:41,466 --> 01:13:42,956
Mr. Guidry?

1274
01:13:44,502 --> 01:13:45,799
I thought you were dead.

1275
01:13:48,339 --> 01:13:53,367
So, you, uh, researched this
yourself, Mr. Guidry?

1276
01:13:53,444 --> 01:13:56,709
Yeah, he's a genius
at these kinds of things.

1277
01:13:59,851 --> 01:14:01,785
All right.
Let's settle this.

1278
01:14:01,853 --> 01:14:03,445
I got a lunch at Commander's.

1279
01:14:03,521 --> 01:14:05,716
Now, if we went to trial,
we'd lose the name,

1280
01:14:05,790 --> 01:14:07,223
so we'll give you that.

1281
01:14:07,292 --> 01:14:09,453
Now it's just money.

1282
01:14:09,527 --> 01:14:11,688
It's impossible
to assess revenues lost,

1283
01:14:11,763 --> 01:14:14,197
so I'm gonna write
a number down,

1284
01:14:14,265 --> 01:14:17,962
and you either accept it,
or we go fightin'.

1285
01:14:27,846 --> 01:14:31,009
Twenty thousand bucks?

1286
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:35,719
I'll take it, man!
Shit, yeah!

1287
01:14:35,787 --> 01:14:37,550
- Yeah!
- Damn it. He'd have taken 10.

1288
01:14:39,357 --> 01:14:41,222
Thank you, Mr. Hale!

1289
01:14:41,292 --> 01:14:43,123
You're welcome, Mr. Bergeron.

1290
01:14:43,194 --> 01:14:44,627
Yeah.

1291
01:14:44,696 --> 01:14:46,926
Uh, we're not quite done here,
young lady.

1292
01:14:46,998 --> 01:14:49,330
Hold on, Ashton.
Don't push it.

1293
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:50,799
Your client's happy.

1294
01:14:50,869 --> 01:14:52,302
Yeah.

1295
01:14:52,370 --> 01:14:55,339
Mr. Bergeron's not my client.

1296
01:14:55,406 --> 01:14:57,203
Mr. Downs paid my retainer.

1297
01:14:57,275 --> 01:14:59,470
What?

1298
01:14:59,544 --> 01:15:02,274
You hired him?

1299
01:15:02,347 --> 01:15:06,511
This is how you finally part
with your precious CD money?

1300
01:15:07,518 --> 01:15:09,952
What could you possibly
want from this?

1301
01:15:15,894 --> 01:15:17,759
Oh, what does he want?

1302
01:15:17,829 --> 01:15:20,662
A lifetime supply of Cheerios?

1303
01:15:20,732 --> 01:15:22,757
What the hell is this?

1304
01:15:22,834 --> 01:15:26,270
And it's gotta be a shiny one,
not dull gray.

1305
01:15:26,337 --> 01:15:28,862
Fine! A shiny one.

1306
01:15:28,940 --> 01:15:31,170
Get this and get it over with.

1307
01:15:43,688 --> 01:15:45,918
It's not a fantasy.
It's a plan.

1308
01:15:45,990 --> 01:15:48,550
Oh, Mr. Downs!

1309
01:15:58,670 --> 01:16:00,638
Damn.

1310
01:16:14,218 --> 01:16:16,686
Whoa.

1311
01:16:20,091 --> 01:16:22,719
Well, we're gonna
take off, Willie.

1312
01:16:22,794 --> 01:16:24,659
So you're gonna be okay
on your own, right?

1313
01:16:24,729 --> 01:16:27,630
It's cool. I figure we'll
be staying open a long time

1314
01:16:27,699 --> 01:16:29,894
before I use up
20 grand, right?

1315
01:16:29,968 --> 01:16:32,300
- Yeah.
- You can do better than that.

1316
01:16:33,638 --> 01:16:36,732
I just told my dad
to fuck off, so...

1317
01:16:36,808 --> 01:16:39,538
I now owe him a hundred grand
for the initial investment,

1318
01:16:39,610 --> 01:16:41,134
plus 20 grand to you, Willie,

1319
01:16:41,212 --> 01:16:43,203
and whatever
that trailer thing costs,

1320
01:16:43,281 --> 01:16:46,739
so... I'd be a pretty motivated partner.

1321
01:16:49,454 --> 01:16:52,446
Don't let Flakes die
when you run out of that money.

1322
01:16:52,523 --> 01:16:55,083
Plus you need a manager, right?

1323
01:17:00,765 --> 01:17:01,754
I'm starving.

1324
01:17:05,370 --> 01:17:08,703
Yeah, I'm getting
my MBA at Tulane.

1325
01:17:08,773 --> 01:17:11,298
No way.
I got my MBA at Tulane.

1326
01:17:11,376 --> 01:17:13,674
Look, Phi Gamma.

1327
01:17:13,745 --> 01:17:15,940
Oh, my God!
I'm a Kappa!

1328
01:17:36,801 --> 01:17:38,632
We are what?

1329
01:17:38,703 --> 01:17:40,466
What are we,
horny consumers?

1330
01:17:40,538 --> 01:17:41,766
No!

1331
01:17:41,839 --> 01:17:43,397
No, no.

1332
01:17:43,474 --> 01:17:44,668
Fuck them.
Consumers are parasites.

1333
01:17:44,742 --> 01:17:46,107
So what are we, then?

1334
01:17:46,177 --> 01:17:48,270
Rebels?

1335
01:17:48,346 --> 01:17:51,440
No, no, no.
Rebels are wanderers, man.

1336
01:17:51,516 --> 01:17:54,178
No, we are the ones that
make originals from copies,

1337
01:17:54,252 --> 01:17:56,447
the ones that turn poison
into food.

1338
01:17:57,789 --> 01:17:59,780
We're the ones that take
every brand-ass,

1339
01:17:59,857 --> 01:18:02,189
mass-marketing
commercial product

1340
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:04,125
and turn it into
something that rocks.

1341
01:18:11,769 --> 01:18:15,296
# We are the Freakies
We are the Freakies #

1342
01:18:15,373 --> 01:18:18,171
# And this is

1343
01:18:19,410 --> 01:18:21,901
# We never miss a meal #

1344
01:18:21,979 --> 01:18:23,913

1345

# We are the Freakies

1356

1358
01:19:12,263 --> 01:19:13,594
# Eating you #

1359
01:19:16,467 --> 01:19:18,162

1360
01:19:18,236 --> 01:19:19,794
# Playing with great crap #

1361
01:19:19,871 --> 01:19:22,840
# Wait for the jobs to shut #

1362
01:19:22,907 --> 01:19:25,876
# They like us soft and fat #

1363
01:19:25,943 --> 01:19:28,036
# But we don't buy into that #

1364
01:19:28,112 --> 01:19:29,773
# We don't buy into that #
