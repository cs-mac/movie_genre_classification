Bad boys, bad boys

00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,357
Boys will be boys

Bad boys, bad boys

11
00:00:42,043 --> 00:00:44,754
- Boys will be boys
- Get me feeling breathless

12
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:47,423
Bad boys, bad boys

13
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:50,051

00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:18,996
The way you hold me tight

21
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,874
You get me so excited

22
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:28,881
You do me, oh, so right

23
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:32,885
My heart goes beep-beep
beep-beep, beep-beep

24
00:01:35,096 --> 00:01:38,891
Bad, bad, bad, bad boys

00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:41,686
You make me feel so good

26

Bad, bad, bad, bad boys

00:01:49,527 --> 00:01:52,238
You make me feel so good

28
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:55,282
Knew you would

00:02:17,513 --> 00:02:20,057

32
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,815

Bad boys, bad boys

37
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:43,414
And when he drives me home

38
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:46,625
I feel safe at night

39
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:53,966
You call me on the phone

40
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:59,764
It goes ring, ring, ring
Ring-a-ring-ring

41
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:03,559
Bad, bad, bad, bad boys

00:04:06,038 --> 00:04:08,624

- Boys will be boys

57
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:13,921
Bad boys, bad boys

58
00:04:14,005 --> 00:04:16,507
- Boys will be boys

59
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,218
Bad boys, bad boys

60
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:21,595
Boys will be boys

61
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:24,432
- Good evening.
- Is this the penthouse?
- Yes, ma'am.
- On the roof.

62
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:30,521
Welcome to another edition of
Lifestyles of the Average and Anxious.

63
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:33,899
We move about the apartment
of Peter Mitchell...

64
00:04:33,983 --> 00:04:36,736
young architect about town.

65
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:41,699
It's his late 30s... Or is it his
early 40s? We'll never know...

66
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:43,617
- birthday party!
- Hi!

67
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:46,912
Entranced by
the euphoria and ease...

68
00:04:46,996 --> 00:04:49,707
these glamourous people exude...

69
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:53,461
I think I spy
the birthday boy himself.

70
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:55,838
Peter!
How are you, old chum?

71
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:58,716
You're looking so well, so well.

72
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:04,805
Over here is his semi-main squeeze,
Rebecca Davidson.

73
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:10,227
The public wants to know
what an attractive,
witty, successful woman sees...

74
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:12,521
in a bozo like my roommate.

75
00:05:12,605 --> 00:05:15,691
Well, he's, um,
he's charming and he's sweet.

76
00:05:15,775 --> 00:05:18,944
He's very thoughtful.
He's sort of boyishly handsome.

77
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:23,616
But he has got
the most amazing...

78
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:28,537
- Thank you, Rebecca.
- You're welcome, Michael.

79
00:05:28,621 --> 00:05:33,250
So, Peter, tell me, are you
and Rebecca still exclusive? Hmm?

80
00:05:33,334 --> 00:05:36,003
- Me and Rebecca?
- Yeah.
- No, we both see other people.

81
00:05:36,087 --> 00:05:38,798
- Oh, really? Oh.
- Yeah, a lot.
- Oh, that's nice to know.

82
00:05:38,881 --> 00:05:41,509
- Bye, Vanessa.
- Bye.

83
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:44,470
- Hey, uh, birthday boy.
- Oh, hi, Adam.

84
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:46,889
- Rebecca's looking sexier than ever.
- Yeah.

85
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:51,143
- You two, uh, still together?
- Oh, yeah. Me and Rebecca
for fýve years now.

86
00:05:51,227 --> 00:05:53,312
- Tight. Tight as ever. Excuse me.
- Cool.

87
00:05:56,732 --> 00:05:59,235
- Good lovin'
- Gimme that good, good lovin'

88
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:01,654
- Good lovin'
- All I need is good lovin'

89
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:03,739
- Good lovin'
- James!

90
00:06:03,823 --> 00:06:06,367
- Yeah, baby.
- Remember the Young Rascals?
What happened to them?

91
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:09,036
- Man, they old.
- No, don't say that.
- Real old.

92
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,206
- I think one of them's a senator now.
- No, God, no, no!

93
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:15,167
- A real old senator!
- Jack. Jack. Can I talk
to you for a minute?

94
00:06:15,251 --> 00:06:17,545
Paul, I'm serious. I'm not doing
commercials any more. Really.

95
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:21,924
No more talking T-bones
or cowboys with heartburn.
I'm only doing serious stuff now.

96
00:06:22,008 --> 00:06:24,010
- Hi. How are ya?
- Oh, Jack.

97
00:06:24,093 --> 00:06:27,054
Whew! Angela. Whew, boy,
you look different. What happened?

98
00:06:27,138 --> 00:06:29,390
- I'm dressed.
- That's it. That's it.

99
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:36,731
Everybody gather 'round now

100
00:06:36,814 --> 00:06:39,233
Move your body to the beat

101
00:06:43,863 --> 00:06:46,073
Gentlemen, I'm in love.

102
00:06:46,157 --> 00:06:48,492
- You?
- Yeah. In a generic sense.

103
00:06:48,576 --> 00:06:50,786
- Right. Right.
- Oh, my. Oh.

104
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,913
- So many women...
- And so little time.

105
00:06:52,997 --> 00:06:55,583
So little time, yeah.

106
00:06:56,876 --> 00:06:59,086
- So, Jack.
- Yeah, what's up?

107
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:02,590
- You're not really gonna
do this movie in Turkey, are ya?
- Yes. Yes, I am.

108
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:05,301
As a matter of fact, I leave
in a few short hours. Here.

109
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:10,765
- What is it, uh, Zalmon the Beautician?
- Barbarian. Zalmon the Barbarian.
I knew you were gonna say that.

110
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:13,809
Okay, well, what about the play in Soho?
The one you said you wanted to do.

111
00:07:13,893 --> 00:07:15,519
- You said it was a chance to...
- Uh, excuse me, please.

112
00:07:15,603 --> 00:07:19,690
Excuse me. You said it was
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

113
00:07:19,774 --> 00:07:20,941
- Hi.
- Oh, come on.

114
00:07:21,025 --> 00:07:25,446
What d... What do you want,
my inevitably brilliant reviews,
or, uh, next month's rent?

115
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:29,575
Forget about next month's rent.
I'll cover you, you do the play.

116
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:33,579
That's sweet of you. You know,
you are a very decent man, Peter.

117
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:37,416
- I'm a goddamned saint.
- "Saint" is a little bit much, but...

118
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,961
Hey, how's it goin', baby?

119
00:07:41,045 --> 00:07:43,381
Name's Johnny. Gimme fýve.

120
00:07:43,464 --> 00:07:47,885
Ooh, I mean, gimme three.
Yeah. Yeah.

121
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:51,764
I can't believe you draw Johnny Cool.
Coolest cat in the world, right?

122
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:54,100
No one cooler, baby.

123
00:07:55,017 --> 00:07:58,270
I can't believe it.
Makes me so happy.

124
00:07:58,354 --> 00:08:01,107
- What's wrong?
- It's David.

125
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:06,070
- The guy you broke up with?
- The good-looking one.
Incredibly good-looking.

126
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:09,782
He used to read me Johnny Cool
every morning over breakfast.

127
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:13,244
Hey. Hey, hey.
Oh, you poor baby.

128
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:15,996
You know how
to get over a lover, hmm?

129
00:08:17,832 --> 00:08:21,085
Dance with a stranger.

130
00:08:22,837 --> 00:08:25,172
David's an incredible dancer.

131
00:08:25,256 --> 00:08:28,426
He studied for three years
with the Joffrey Ballet.

132
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,471
Three years? Joffrey Ballet?

133
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:38,436
I think you guys
are gonna get back together.

134
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:42,356
You think that I could call him up
and invite him to the party?

135
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,483
Uh, yeah, uh...

136
00:08:44,567 --> 00:08:46,402
Come on, shake your body
Baby, do that conga

137
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:48,487
I know you can't
control yourself any longer

138
00:08:48,571 --> 00:08:50,656
Feel the rhythm of the beat
It's getting stronger

139
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,451
Don't you fight it
till you try to do that conga beat

140
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:56,871
Twins!

141
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:01,125
There it is.

142
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:06,422
Yeah! Arguably one of the best
clutch shots of all time.

143
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:11,844
Forget the guys playing today.
Nobody played this game better
than Reed, West, Chamberlain, Baylor.

144
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:14,263
I'll run it for you again
in slow motion.

145
00:09:14,347 --> 00:09:17,767
People are asking for you.
Come on, let's go mingle.

146
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:21,187
I hate that word. It sounds like
something sea lions do before they mate.

147
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,856
You are the guest of honour,
and they love you.

148
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:26,442
Of course they do,
but these guys need me in here.
Don't you need me in here, guys?

149
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:30,404
- Go on, get outta here.
- Leave your money.
- Yeah, we need that.

150
00:09:30,488 --> 00:09:33,532
- Wait, there it is.
- Yeah!

151
00:09:33,616 --> 00:09:37,119
- Undoubtedly, the greatest clutch shot
in basketball history.
...clutch shot in basketball...

152
00:09:37,203 --> 00:09:39,830
- Unarguably.
- In slow motion.

153
00:09:39,914 --> 00:09:41,582
The best.

154
00:09:43,334 --> 00:09:45,544
Oh, Paul, Paul. Wait, wait.
Listen to me, man.

155
00:09:45,628 --> 00:09:48,005
You are my friend.
You're a great director.

156
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:50,383
But I am not doing commercials
ever again. I mean it.

157
00:09:50,466 --> 00:09:53,594
Jack, I don't want you to do
a commercial. I need a favour.

158
00:09:53,678 --> 00:09:55,680
Oh. Yeah, all right, shoot. What?

159
00:09:55,763 --> 00:09:58,557
I'm having a package delivered tomorrow,
but I won't be home to get it.

160
00:09:58,641 --> 00:10:01,852
I gotta go off to San Francisco all week
on a commercial shoot.

161
00:10:01,936 --> 00:10:04,563
- You're gonna shoot in San Francisco?
- Yeah.

162
00:10:04,647 --> 00:10:06,982
- Who are you using?
- Oh, Len Peters.

163
00:10:07,066 --> 00:10:11,237
Lenny. Lenny. What's wrong? Didn't you
like my last dog food commercial?

164
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,447
Oh, Jack, that was a classic.

165
00:10:13,531 --> 00:10:16,450
But now look,
I was hoping that I could have
this package delivered here instead.

166
00:10:16,534 --> 00:10:18,577
Sure, no problem. No problem.

167
00:10:18,661 --> 00:10:21,580
Listen, let me ask you something here.

168
00:10:21,664 --> 00:10:26,168
- Do you think I'm overexposed?
- Overexposed? Oh, no, Jack, not at all.

169
00:10:26,252 --> 00:10:28,879
Now look, it'll be delivered tomorrow
and picked up by a couple of guys
on Thursday morning.

170
00:10:28,963 --> 00:10:31,465
- That's all there is to it.
- All right. Tomorrow, pick up Thursday.

171
00:10:31,549 --> 00:10:35,386
Okay, but this is... this is
a very delicate matter, Jack, so don't
mention it to anybody, all right?

172
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:38,514
- All right, yeah. Delicate.
- Happy birthday to you

173
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:44,103
Happy birthday, dear Peter

174
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:48,941
Happy birthday to you

175
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:55,031
He's so shy.

176
00:10:55,114 --> 00:10:58,451
- Speech! Speech!
- Oh, look, um...

177
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,665
First of all, um, uh...

178
00:11:04,749 --> 00:11:08,210
I wanna thank, uh,
Jack and Michael and Rebecca...

179
00:11:08,294 --> 00:11:13,215
for, uh, embarrassing me
with this unending flow of sentiment.

180
00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:15,217
- Oh!
- I, uh...

181
00:11:15,301 --> 00:11:18,346
- Thanks for coming.
- Hey, all right! All right!

182
00:11:18,429 --> 00:11:21,640
- Go on! Blow out the candles! Quick!
- Whoa! Whoa!

183
00:11:25,436 --> 00:11:28,773
I think everybody had a great time.
Don't you?

184
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:31,275
I sure did.

185
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:36,697
Why don't you stick around a while?

186
00:11:38,324 --> 00:11:40,951
I thought sentiment
made you uncomfortable.

187
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,789
- I can handle it...
- Mm-hmm.

188
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:47,291
As long as it's disguised as sex.

189
00:11:49,669 --> 00:11:52,088
So stay tonight.

190
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:58,594
I can't.

191
00:11:58,678 --> 00:12:01,931
- I have to be up at 7:00
for a pretrial meeting.
- Yeah?

192
00:12:03,641 --> 00:12:05,643
Yeah.

193
00:12:12,108 --> 00:12:14,527
Happy birthday, Peter. Mmm.

194
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:19,740
Yeah, right.

195
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:24,412
It was a great party.

196
00:12:32,503 --> 00:12:36,632
You know, in this light
you're kinda ugly. Yeah.

197
00:12:36,716 --> 00:12:40,094
Yeah, that rut
in the middle of your forehead?
Gettin' out of hand. Out of hand.

198
00:12:40,177 --> 00:12:42,346
- How come that always happens to you?
- What?

199
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,598
Well, as soon as you get
a woman into your room...

200
00:12:44,682 --> 00:12:47,727
you turn into her big brother
and start solving her problems.

201
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:51,981
Well, unlike yourself and our
sexually insatiable roommate...

202
00:12:52,064 --> 00:12:56,152
I happen to be a sensitive guy,
and I have more on my mind
than simply pronging chicks.

203
00:12:56,235 --> 00:12:59,864
Hey, guys. Say, what's a good year
for pronging chicks?

204
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:02,199
The '82 bordeaux on the left
works every time.

205
00:13:02,283 --> 00:13:04,869
Thank you very much.

206
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:07,288
- What happened here? Somebody die?
- Rebecca left early.

207
00:13:07,371 --> 00:13:11,334
- Oh.
- Michael saved another
doomed relationship.

208
00:13:11,417 --> 00:13:13,669
Post-party depression.

209
00:13:13,753 --> 00:13:18,132
Listen, you guys, you know,
I'm outta here tomorrow for ten weeks.

210
00:13:18,215 --> 00:13:20,593
What do you say
I get rid of Cherise...

211
00:13:20,676 --> 00:13:24,638
No, no, the three of us
hunker down here with a bottle of wine
and shoot some pool.

212
00:13:24,722 --> 00:13:28,851
I got a better idea.
Why don't you two guys hunker down,
shoot some pool, and I'll, uh, take...

213
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:31,896
- No, no, no.
- Why don't you just go
and have a good time?

214
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:35,399
- Yeah, enjoy yourself.
- Oh, guys.

215
00:13:35,483 --> 00:13:38,986
Tough job, but it's gotta be done.
Oh.

216
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:42,740
- He's unbelievable.
- The man is one giant gland.

217
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:50,998
- Jack.
- Seventy-nine.

218
00:13:51,082 --> 00:13:54,210
- Jack!
- He left already, Cherise. Eighty.

219
00:13:54,293 --> 00:13:56,504
- Hi, this is Peter, Michael and Jack.
- Great. I think he took my mousse.

220
00:13:56,587 --> 00:13:58,506
- We're out playing
and can't come to the phone.
- That's our boy. Eighty-two.

221
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:01,509
- We'll call you back as soon as we can.
- So leave a message
at the sound of the tone.
- Thanks, Peter. See you around.

222
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:03,928
Yeah. Eighty-four.

223
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:07,640
Hi, it's me, Jack. Uh, I'm at the
airport just about to board the plane.

224
00:14:07,723 --> 00:14:12,353
But I forgot to tell you something.
There's a package
gonna be delivered today.

225
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:15,022
Uh, some guys'll pick it up
Thursday before noon.

226
00:14:15,106 --> 00:14:17,608
Just put it aside, don't worry about it.
And, oh, wait a minute.

227
00:14:17,692 --> 00:14:21,570
It's, uh, it's a very delicate
matter, so don't, don't say
anything to anybody. Okay?

228
00:14:21,654 --> 00:14:26,158
I'll bring you guys something back
from Turkey if you're good.
Maybe a drumstick or somethin'.

229
00:14:26,242 --> 00:14:29,662
- See you later. Bye-bye.
- Ninety.

230
00:14:40,131 --> 00:14:43,467
- Hi, Harry.
- Good morning, sir.

231
00:15:02,111 --> 00:15:04,572
Michael! Michael, get out here!

232
00:15:05,698 --> 00:15:08,325
- What is it?
- Just get out here.

233
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,711
What?

234
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:23,341
- What's goin' on?
- I don't know. What's goin' on?

235
00:15:23,424 --> 00:15:26,469
Oh, okay.
Just look out in the hall.

236
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:30,473
- Yeah?
- Just look out in the hall.

237
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:35,102
Okay.

238
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:40,566
- That's a baby.
- Oh, I know it's a baby.

239
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:43,903
- What's it doing there?
- It's sleeping.

240
00:15:43,986 --> 00:15:46,864
Oh, okay. Who do you
suppose it belongs to?

241
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:50,659
Oh, Peter, there's a little note.

242
00:15:50,743 --> 00:15:54,497
All right, I'll just go in and...

243
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,999
okay, play along.

244
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:02,129
"Dear Jack, here is our baby..."

245
00:16:02,213 --> 00:16:04,340
Oh, no.

246
00:16:04,423 --> 00:16:07,093
- You really don't know
anything about this?
- I knew it.

247
00:16:07,176 --> 00:16:10,638
I knew it. I knew this was gonna
happen to him sooner or later.

248
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:15,309
- "I can't handle this now.
I don't know where else to turn.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Right.

249
00:16:15,393 --> 00:16:18,729
- "Someday I hope
you can both forgive me.
- Unbelievable.

250
00:16:18,813 --> 00:16:21,148
Her name is Mary. Love, Sylvia."
Who's Sylvia?

251
00:16:21,232 --> 00:16:25,695
How am I supposed to know?
You have to be a social secretary
to keep track of all his women.

252
00:16:25,778 --> 00:16:28,614
He left a message about a package.
He said it'd be delivered today.

253
00:16:28,698 --> 00:16:30,866
He said to put it aside
and not to worry about it.

254
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:34,286
- He said that about a baby?
- I'd say he takes his procreation
business a little lightly.

255
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:37,832
- So what are we supposed
to do about this?
- We pick it up.

256
00:16:37,915 --> 00:16:40,459
- You pick it up.
- I'm not picking it up.

257
00:16:40,543 --> 00:16:42,712
You found it!

258
00:16:48,217 --> 00:16:52,013
- Look, we gotta do something.
One of us has to pick it up.
- Well, it's not gonna be me!

259
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:03,649
Now what? I don't know anything
about taking care of babies.

260
00:17:03,733 --> 00:17:06,068
Well, neither do I!

261
00:17:06,152 --> 00:17:08,571
- Look, we gotta do something!
- Be my guest.

262
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:11,157
- Hey, it's not my responsibility.
- It's not mine either!

263
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,618
- Don't yell at me, Peter.
- Well, it can't be that diffýcult.

264
00:17:14,702 --> 00:17:16,912
All we gotta do is, is feed it.
It'll shut up.

265
00:17:16,996 --> 00:17:19,582
- Well, I don't know what babies eat.
- Soft stuff.

266
00:17:19,665 --> 00:17:22,418
I mean, we were babies once, for God's
sake. What did... What did we eat?

267
00:17:22,501 --> 00:17:25,171
I don't know. It couldn't have been
very good. I can't remember.

268
00:17:28,174 --> 00:17:31,761
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Where you goin'?
- I'm going to the market
to get some baby food.

269
00:17:31,844 --> 00:17:33,888
We can't feed it birthday cake
and goat cheese.

270
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:37,183
- So what am I supposed to do?
- Entertain it.

271
00:17:37,266 --> 00:17:39,685
"Entertain it."

272
00:17:42,855 --> 00:17:46,025
Entertain it?
How do you entertain a baby?

273
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:49,737
Hey, junior. Hey, look.
L-Look at my hands. Hey.

274
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:53,324
Hey. Look at this. Look at this.

275
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:56,994
Oh, it's a... it's a gla... it's a prism.
Whoa. Look at those colours, huh?

276
00:17:57,078 --> 00:18:00,373
This is nice stuff, huh? This is
expensive. You don't like that, huh?

277
00:18:00,456 --> 00:18:02,958
Well, how about, uh... Oh! Ooh, look!
It's almost like, uh...

278
00:18:03,042 --> 00:18:06,212
Look, Japanese origami, almost,
with the hands.

279
00:18:06,295 --> 00:18:08,547
It's a bird! It's a bird!
No, huh?

280
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:14,095
Uh... Uh... I'm gettin' a headache.
You're givin' me a headache.

281
00:18:14,178 --> 00:18:16,764
Uh, how about, uh... how about this?
How about this? Look at this.

282
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:20,643
Look at the hairy chest.
You like that? You like that?
You wanna... You want one of these?

283
00:18:20,726 --> 00:18:23,145
Price check!

284
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,441
Excuse me. Uh, where could I
get a jar of baby food?

285
00:18:27,525 --> 00:18:29,944
- Uh, third aisle to the right.
- Right.

286
00:18:36,534 --> 00:18:39,370
- Joe, I need a cheque okay on three.
- It's the larger size?

287
00:18:39,453 --> 00:18:42,039
- Got it.
- This is cheaper.
- Oh.

288
00:18:47,086 --> 00:18:49,130
They gotta be kidding.

289
00:18:49,213 --> 00:18:52,550
What's happenin', baby?
How you doin' today, huh?

290
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:55,845
My name is Johnny.
That's right. That's right.

291
00:18:55,928 --> 00:18:58,097
But you can call me Mr Cool.
You know what I'm sayin'?

292
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:02,018
Hey, wh-what's your name, huh?
Huh? Haven't I seen you
around the neighbourhood?

293
00:19:02,101 --> 00:19:04,478
Come on, baby, wh... Wait, what's
the matter? Cat got your tongue?

294
00:19:04,562 --> 00:19:07,857
Why can't you talk? Huh? Huh?

295
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:14,655
Come on, kid, laugh it up.
I'm doin' my best.

296
00:19:18,242 --> 00:19:21,287
Mr Foley, I need
a cheque okay on two.

297
00:19:24,206 --> 00:19:27,126
Excuse me. Uh, is this
a good meal for a baby?

298
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:29,754
- That's for toddlers.
- Toddler? What's a toddler?

299
00:19:29,837 --> 00:19:33,132
- Ayear and half, two years.
- No, no, l-I need something for a baby.

300
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:35,134
- This is your fýrst.
- First what?

301
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:39,055
- Baby.
- Uh, yeah. First and the last.

302
00:19:39,138 --> 00:19:42,433
- No matter how much you prepare, you're
never quite ready for 'em, are you?
- No, you're not.

303
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:46,020
- Um, listen, could you... Can you hel...
- Did you know that what an infant eats
in its fýrst 12 months...

304
00:19:46,103 --> 00:19:49,315
can determine its entire
psychological and physical future?

305
00:19:49,398 --> 00:19:51,984
That's fascinating,
but all I need is some food.

306
00:19:52,068 --> 00:19:54,612
Just some food, that's all, uh, Edna.

307
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:57,281
- What's the best-selling brand?
- That white can over there.

308
00:19:57,365 --> 00:20:02,828
- Great. This is the best, then?
- No, it's the cheapest.
That's why it sells the most.

309
00:20:02,912 --> 00:20:05,331
- Uh-huh. How about this one, then?
- Oh, that's good.

310
00:20:05,414 --> 00:20:07,792
- Good.
- But it's got iron in it.

311
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:10,461
- Is that bad?
- It is if your baby's allergic to it.

312
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:13,756
- How do you know
if she's allergic to it?
- They throw up all over you.

313
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:17,843
Of course, they throw up all over you
even if they're not allergic to it too.

314
00:20:17,927 --> 00:20:20,680
Some babies can't hold anything down
for more than a minute.

315
00:20:21,514 --> 00:20:24,475
- What about this one?
- That's for older babies.

316
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:26,977
How old's your baby?

317
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:32,274
- About that old.
- You don't know how old your baby is?

318
00:20:32,358 --> 00:20:34,735
Yes, I do. I know...
I know how old my baby is.

319
00:20:34,819 --> 00:20:36,487
- Is she teething?
- Teething?

320
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:39,240
Well, you know, uh,
does she cry all night?

321
00:20:39,323 --> 00:20:41,409
Does she chew on her fýst
and drool a lot?

322
00:20:41,492 --> 00:20:47,790
All right, okay, then I'll take three of
these and I'll take some of these, and
thanks very much for your time, Edna.

323
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:52,294
You've been a source of great stress.

324
00:20:52,378 --> 00:20:56,757
Don't forget, if the baby's
less than three months old,
you gotta sterilize the nipples.

325
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:02,013
Aw, shit!

326
00:21:04,515 --> 00:21:06,392
Here I come!

327
00:21:13,524 --> 00:21:19,405
Hey, hey, hey, look, I'll, uh... I'll
give you ten bucks if you stop crying.
Huh? Ten bucks. Huh? You like that?

328
00:21:21,282 --> 00:21:25,828
Hey, I'm gonna pick you up now, huh?
Here you go, junior. Here you go.

329
00:21:25,911 --> 00:21:28,414
Is that better? No, huh?

330
00:21:28,497 --> 00:21:32,043
All right, well, how about,
uh, how about a little walk, huh?
How about a little walk?

331
00:21:32,126 --> 00:21:35,129
Here, hey, wait a minute. Let me...
Let me... Here you go. Here we go.

332
00:21:35,212 --> 00:21:37,840
Okay. Hey, how 'bout this, huh?

333
00:21:37,923 --> 00:21:41,093
There... N-No, no-no, no-no-no.
We're not gonna keep cryin'.

334
00:21:41,177 --> 00:21:44,722
No, no, no, no! No, no!
Hey, wait a minute. Oh, look! Hey!

335
00:21:44,805 --> 00:21:48,684
Rock-a-bye baby
On the treetop

336
00:21:48,768 --> 00:21:51,937
When the bough breaks...

337
00:21:52,021 --> 00:21:54,357
Something and something
Something...

338
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,568
Come on. Where the hell is he,
milkin' the cows or somethin'?

339
00:21:57,651 --> 00:22:00,613
Hey, look. No, no, no, no, no crying.
No, no, no. No... No crying.

340
00:22:00,696 --> 00:22:03,991
Hey, wait a minute. Whoa, ooh, no!
You can... You can drive a guy to drink.
You know that?

341
00:22:04,075 --> 00:22:08,454
No. No, not you.
You're a cute little thing. Yeah, yeah.

342
00:22:08,537 --> 00:22:11,874
Oh, wait a minute. How about...
Hush, little baby, don't you cry

343
00:22:11,957 --> 00:22:15,586
When Peter gets home
I'm gonna punch him in the eye... Hush.

344
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:20,257
All right... All right, here we are.
Here we are in my room. Yeah.

345
00:22:20,341 --> 00:22:22,760
Look... Look around here.
This is nice, huh?

346
00:22:22,843 --> 00:22:26,764
Uh, uh, maybe you can, uh...
Here, we'll sit down here and, uh...

347
00:22:26,847 --> 00:22:29,225
Oh, look! Look!
We're gonna watch a little TV.

348
00:22:29,308 --> 00:22:33,479
Yeah. Yeah. We'll watch a little TV.
Just you and me, huh?

349
00:22:33,562 --> 00:22:37,983
Here you go. There you go.
Amuse yourself.

350
00:22:38,067 --> 00:22:41,320
Women are wondering:
Are they having an orgasm?

351
00:22:41,404 --> 00:22:45,866
- Men are worried
maybe their penis isn't...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

352
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:49,954
No, no, no, no, no, you don't want
to hear that. No, no, no, no, no.

353
00:22:50,329 --> 00:22:53,749
Okay, we're gonna have a nice
conversation with Uncle Peter...

354
00:22:53,833 --> 00:22:56,085
and let him have some fun now, yeah?

355
00:22:56,168 --> 00:22:59,797
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Where the hell have you been?

356
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,341
- Oh, hi, Mrs Hathaway.
- Mr Kellam, this package just arri...

357
00:23:02,425 --> 00:23:05,261
- Oh, what a darling little baby.
- Yeah.

358
00:23:05,344 --> 00:23:07,722
- Is it yours?
- No, no, no, no. It's not mine.

359
00:23:07,805 --> 00:23:11,851
- Mr Mitchell's?
- No, no, no, no, no.
Someone sort of loaned it to us.

360
00:23:11,934 --> 00:23:14,937
- W-We're watching her for a while.
- Well, what is its name?

361
00:23:15,021 --> 00:23:18,065
Her name is, uh, it's, uh, Sylvia.

362
00:23:18,149 --> 00:23:20,651
No, Mary. Mary. Mary. Yeah.

363
00:23:20,735 --> 00:23:23,279
Well, we've had a tough morning,
and we're all tuckered out.

364
00:23:23,362 --> 00:23:26,240
We've been drooling, so, uh,
we're gonna just say goodbye, okay?

365
00:23:26,324 --> 00:23:29,869
- Bye-bye, Mrs Hathaway. Bye-bye. Yeah.
- Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

366
00:23:29,952 --> 00:23:35,291
Oh, by the way, um, this package
Just arrived for you downstairs.

367
00:23:35,374 --> 00:23:39,003
Uh, all right, great. Great.
Th-Thanks, Mrs Hathaway.

368
00:23:39,086 --> 00:23:42,006
- Could I hold her for just a minute?
- Oh, I don't think so.
She doesn't really...

369
00:23:42,089 --> 00:23:45,760
I just love babies. Oh, yes.

370
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:49,889
I just love babies.

371
00:23:49,972 --> 00:23:54,060
Unfortunately, Mr Hathaway and I
were never able to have any of our own.

372
00:23:54,143 --> 00:23:57,521
- Mr Hathaway has a low sperm count.
- Well, some guys have all the luck.

373
00:23:57,605 --> 00:24:00,316
Oh, oh, you are...

374
00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:03,444
You are a cute little bundle,
aren't you?

375
00:24:05,529 --> 00:24:09,283
You do realize she did a doodle.
Yes, you did.

376
00:24:09,367 --> 00:24:13,037
Would you like me to
give you a hand in changing her?

377
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,332
No. No, no, no, I can do it.
L-l-I'm used to it. I'm used to it.

378
00:24:16,415 --> 00:24:19,502
Well, thanks a lot, Mrs Hathaway.
We gotta go now. All right?

379
00:24:19,585 --> 00:24:21,962
So, uh, so we're gonna say bye-bye now.

380
00:24:22,046 --> 00:24:24,423
- All right? Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye. Bye-bye, Mary.

381
00:24:24,507 --> 00:24:27,468
- Bye-bye. Bye. Bye-bye. Okay, bye.
- Little child.

382
00:24:27,551 --> 00:24:29,804
Of course, if you ever need
anyone to babysit...

383
00:24:29,887 --> 00:24:31,847
All right. Yeah? All right.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

384
00:24:31,931 --> 00:24:35,142
- Mr Mitchell, she's a lovely baby.
- Yeah, adorable.

385
00:24:35,226 --> 00:24:38,688
Where the hell have you been?
This baby hasn't stopped crying
since you left, and she did a doodle.

386
00:24:38,771 --> 00:24:42,650
"Doodle"? What the hell's that?
No, don't tell me. I don't want to know.

387
00:24:42,733 --> 00:24:45,695
Oh, you're gonna know, pal, 'cause
she did it. What's with all the bags?

388
00:24:45,778 --> 00:24:49,865
I had to go to three different places to
buy four different kinds of formula...

389
00:24:49,949 --> 00:24:54,745
two different kinds of diapers,
bottles, towels, nipples.

390
00:24:54,829 --> 00:24:57,331
You have no idea
how much crap these kids need.

391
00:24:57,415 --> 00:25:00,042
- How old is she, anyway?
- How should I know? You want me
to check her driver's licence?

392
00:25:00,126 --> 00:25:02,378
- Feel her teeth.
- What?
- Just feel her teeth.

393
00:25:02,461 --> 00:25:05,089
The druggist said that you can tell
how old she is by feeling her teeth.

394
00:25:05,172 --> 00:25:08,509
Well, I'm not feeling her teeth!
You feel her teeth!
I'm tired of holding her, anyway! Here!

395
00:25:08,592 --> 00:25:11,470
No! Uh, no, I can't hold her and,
and make her bottle at the same time.

396
00:25:11,554 --> 00:25:14,598
All right, I'll hold her,
you check for the teeth, okay?

397
00:25:16,225 --> 00:25:18,853
- Come on!
- All right.

398
00:25:25,943 --> 00:25:27,695
- I can't feel anything.
- What do you think that means?

399
00:25:27,778 --> 00:25:31,532
- It means she doesn't
have any damn teeth!
- Well, neither did Gabby Hayes,
and he was 90! So what?

400
00:25:31,615 --> 00:25:35,369
All right, then we'll give her
the stuff for newborns,
hope she's not allergic to it.

401
00:25:35,453 --> 00:25:39,623
You have no idea how much stuff
these kids can be allergic to.
What's that stench?

402
00:25:39,707 --> 00:25:43,753
Michael, hold her.
Just hold her. That's it.

403
00:25:43,836 --> 00:25:47,840
- Wait a minute. Peter, this is a girl.
Should we be doing this?
- Michael, just hold her, will ya,
so I can get the diaper off.

404
00:25:49,383 --> 00:25:51,886
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

405
00:25:51,969 --> 00:25:55,473
How can something so small create
so much of something so disgusting?

406
00:25:55,556 --> 00:25:59,560
Oh, God. Beats the shit out of me.
All right, hand me the other diaper.
There, take...

407
00:26:01,437 --> 00:26:03,773
- Wait a minute.
Shouldn't we wash her fýrst?
- Uh, we'll wash her later.

408
00:26:03,856 --> 00:26:07,234
Just... Well, give me the cotton.
Give me the... Oh!

409
00:26:07,318 --> 00:26:10,237
How about this?

410
00:26:10,321 --> 00:26:12,448
Come on. Uh, Michael, l...
Just give me a little cotton.

411
00:26:12,531 --> 00:26:14,408
- I don't need a package.
I just need some cotton.
- All right, here.

412
00:26:14,492 --> 00:26:17,662
Oh, no, wait, g... The wipies. Get me the
g... the, you know, the cotton wipies.

413
00:26:17,745 --> 00:26:20,164
Right.

414
00:26:22,124 --> 00:26:24,669
Here it is.

415
00:26:24,752 --> 00:26:27,463
- All right.
- Ooh, this is disgusting.

416
00:26:27,546 --> 00:26:31,634
It's all over, and it's, it's...
it's sticky and...

417
00:26:31,717 --> 00:26:34,762
We're gonna need some kind of
cleaning fluid to get it off.

418
00:26:34,845 --> 00:26:38,557
- How about after-shave?
- Aw, come on, Michael!
Just get me one of the diapers!

419
00:26:38,641 --> 00:26:40,434
All right.

420
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:47,108
All right, good. Now, these tape things
go in the front or the back?

421
00:26:47,191 --> 00:26:50,903
- Uh, how am I supposed to know?
- Okay. There.

422
00:26:50,986 --> 00:26:53,322
Whoa! These diapers are way too big.

423
00:26:53,406 --> 00:26:56,617
- What size did you get, adult?
- They're ultra-absorbent.

424
00:26:56,701 --> 00:26:58,995
The more absorbent the better,
if you ask me.

425
00:26:59,078 --> 00:27:01,580
Will you hold her for a minute?
The kid's going crazy. L...

426
00:27:01,664 --> 00:27:03,332
- I don't want to.
- Come on, Michael!

427
00:27:03,416 --> 00:27:06,002
- Hey, don't pull that so hard.
It's gonna rip.
- I'm not gonna rip it.

428
00:27:06,085 --> 00:27:08,504
Yes, you are.

429
00:27:08,587 --> 00:27:11,799
All right, well, okay, uh, get me
another diaper. I'll use the tape.

430
00:27:11,882 --> 00:27:15,594
I'll use the tape from the diaper,
I'll tape it up.
I'm an architect, for Christ's sakes.

431
00:27:15,678 --> 00:27:18,889
I build 50-storey skyscrapers.
I assemble cities of the future.

432
00:27:18,973 --> 00:27:21,976
I can certainly put together
a goddam diaper.

433
00:27:22,059 --> 00:27:24,353
Take it easy, kid, all right?

434
00:27:27,398 --> 00:27:30,276
There. There. See? It's working.

435
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:33,446
Piece of cake. There. Yeah.

436
00:27:35,197 --> 00:27:38,242
Nice job, Pete.

437
00:27:47,043 --> 00:27:52,423
The little insect was just waiting
for that diaper to fall off.

438
00:27:52,506 --> 00:27:55,384
I think we're in trouble.

439
00:28:01,974 --> 00:28:04,393
I'm gonna kill Jack.

440
00:28:06,604 --> 00:28:08,189
I'm gonna kill him.

441
00:28:18,741 --> 00:28:21,202
- This is the deal. Yeah, that's it.
- Michael.

442
00:28:21,285 --> 00:28:23,954
- What?
- You're gonna have to wash
where the poop was.

443
00:28:24,038 --> 00:28:26,916
- Now, come on.
- All righty.

444
00:28:26,999 --> 00:28:29,251
- Come on.
- I've got that handled.
- No, no, just...

445
00:28:29,335 --> 00:28:31,671
- Perfect.
- You're not getting
anything off that way.

446
00:28:31,754 --> 00:28:34,924
There. There you go.

447
00:28:35,007 --> 00:28:36,926
- That's clean. Isn't that clean?
- Yeah, right.

448
00:28:37,009 --> 00:28:39,011
- And her... her privates.
- I'll rinse her.

449
00:28:39,095 --> 00:28:41,639
- All right. Rinse her out a little bit.
- There we go.

450
00:28:41,722 --> 00:28:45,810
Okay. This says...
This says "For moisturizing and..."

451
00:28:45,893 --> 00:28:48,521
- Don't use the baby lotion now.
It's lotion.
- Well, it says... -

452
00:28:48,604 --> 00:28:51,190
- It says "Prevents
chapping and chaffýng."
- Just wash the baby.

453
00:28:51,273 --> 00:28:55,277
Well, I should put some in there anyway
Just to sort of make sure she's not...

454
00:29:09,125 --> 00:29:10,918
Okay.

455
00:30:01,302 --> 00:30:03,471
We gotta get some help.

456
00:30:03,554 --> 00:30:09,602
Jack said this is a delicate situation,
that we shouldn't tell anybody.

457
00:30:09,685 --> 00:30:15,274
Can you believe him, putting us through
hell to save his precious reputation?

458
00:30:15,358 --> 00:30:17,777
I'm not doing it any more.

459
00:30:20,655 --> 00:30:22,448
Odds.

460
00:31:33,894 --> 00:31:36,313
Willie, they need you
over here a minute.

461
00:31:40,526 --> 00:31:43,237
Make a little room.

462
00:31:43,321 --> 00:31:47,825
- Well, at least it ain't rainin'.
- You're gonna have a headache.
- Try sleepin' nights, Peter.

463
00:31:48,617 --> 00:31:51,495
Mary, let me have the pen.

464
00:31:51,579 --> 00:31:55,374
Come on. Come on. I'm later than usual
this week for the deadline.

465
00:31:55,458 --> 00:31:58,669
Come here. Okay... Oh!

466
00:32:07,345 --> 00:32:10,389
Actually, Sam, l... I don't seem
to have them here after all.

467
00:32:10,473 --> 00:32:15,186
I must have left them at the offýce,
but, uh, I'll get them
fýrst thing in the morning. Right.

468
00:32:17,563 --> 00:32:19,982
Your daddy's a dead man.

469
00:32:29,158 --> 00:32:32,036
- Rebecca, you're...
- Yeah, I came as soon as I got
your messages. What's the emer...

470
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:34,872
- Who are... Who are you?
- Um...
- Jan.

471
00:32:34,955 --> 00:32:38,959
- This is Jan Clopatz.
This is Peter Mitchell.
- Pleasure to meet you.
- How do you do? Come on.

472
00:32:39,043 --> 00:32:41,545
Jan is a cellist from Hungary.

473
00:32:41,629 --> 00:32:44,423
He's playing with the Brauslau
Baroque Ensemble at Carnegie Hall.

474
00:32:44,507 --> 00:32:47,718
- What a thrill.
- Peter, what's the emergency?

475
00:32:47,802 --> 00:32:51,347
Just come with me.

476
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:53,849
This is the big emergency.

477
00:32:57,478 --> 00:33:02,149
- It's a baby.
- Why is that the fýrst thing
everybody says..."It's a baby"?
Of course it's a baby.

478
00:33:02,233 --> 00:33:04,777
- It's your baby?
- No, it's not my baby.

479
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:07,071
- It's Jack's baby.
- Jack has a baby?

480
00:33:07,154 --> 00:33:10,992
I realize such a concept
tends to negate our belief
in a benevolent God, but yes.

481
00:33:11,075 --> 00:33:13,911
Well, it doesn't look like Jack.
Jack's got more hair.

482
00:33:13,995 --> 00:33:17,081
I'm glad you can joke at a time
like this. See? She needs to be held.

483
00:33:17,164 --> 00:33:20,209
- Babies like to be held.
- Hmm.

484
00:33:20,292 --> 00:33:22,503
- Where is he?
- Jack? Oh.

485
00:33:22,586 --> 00:33:25,548
Jack's in Turkey, which is where I'd be
if my baby was in New York.

486
00:33:25,631 --> 00:33:27,675
Now look, Rebecca, we're dying here.

487
00:33:27,758 --> 00:33:31,429
Michael doesn't know
anything about babies.
I don't know anything about babies.

488
00:33:31,512 --> 00:33:34,140
On top of that,
I got deadlines hanging all over me.

489
00:33:34,223 --> 00:33:37,810
I've been reading these...
these books about babies.

490
00:33:37,893 --> 00:33:40,312
I can't fýgure it out.
For instance, it says here... Look.

491
00:33:40,396 --> 00:33:44,692
"Feed every two hours." Well, it takes
me two hours to get her to eat anything.

492
00:33:44,775 --> 00:33:47,528
So does it mean feed her
every two hours from when I start?

493
00:33:47,611 --> 00:33:49,405
- Yeah.
- Or every two hours from when I fýnish?

494
00:33:49,488 --> 00:33:53,617
Because I've been feeding her
every two hours from when I start,
and I'm feeding her all the time!

495
00:33:53,701 --> 00:33:56,495
- Mmm.
- So which is it?

496
00:33:56,579 --> 00:33:58,873
- Why are you asking me?
- Because you're a woman.

497
00:33:58,956 --> 00:34:01,834
Yeah. That doesn't mean I automatically
know what to do with babies.

498
00:34:01,917 --> 00:34:03,753
Rebecca, now, pl...

499
00:34:05,463 --> 00:34:09,592
please, uh, stay with me and,
and help me take care of her.

500
00:34:09,675 --> 00:34:12,094
- You want me to take care of her.
- Yes.

501
00:34:12,178 --> 00:34:15,806
- Now?
- No, when she graduates from college.
Yes, now.

502
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:18,142
I can't do that, Peter.

503
00:34:18,225 --> 00:34:22,104
Baby take very,
very much work, huh? Yeah.

504
00:34:22,188 --> 00:34:25,649
Thank you for telling me that, Jan.
I didn't know that.
What is he, an idiot savant?

505
00:34:25,733 --> 00:34:28,319
Rebecca, we... we'll be late and...

506
00:34:28,402 --> 00:34:32,114
Uh... W... Uh... Rebecca, no, now...

507
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:38,663
Rebecca, please! Stay with me!

508
00:34:38,746 --> 00:34:41,999
- I have got a date.
- Oh?

509
00:34:43,376 --> 00:34:45,878
Oh, excuse me for cramping
your romantic style.

510
00:34:45,961 --> 00:34:47,630
Rebecca, we'll be late, huh?

511
00:34:47,713 --> 00:34:50,299
- Uh, just...
- You can't be serious about this guy.

512
00:34:50,383 --> 00:34:53,552
Oh, come on, Peter. You go out
with other people and so do I.
We agreed to that.

513
00:34:53,636 --> 00:34:56,597
You can go out with the whole damn
string section for all I care.
That's not the issue.

514
00:34:56,681 --> 00:34:59,183
- Right now I need you here.
- Well, I can't be here now.

515
00:34:59,266 --> 00:35:02,687
- Oh! She doodled.
- Doodled!

516
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:05,898
Yes, doodled! What's the matter?
Don't babies doodle in Hungary?

517
00:35:05,981 --> 00:35:09,235
- We're leaving.
- Uh, Rebecca, no, wait.

518
00:35:10,695 --> 00:35:13,239
Come on, Rebecca, please. Don't go.

519
00:35:14,615 --> 00:35:17,785
Peter, you're a very big boy,
you're very capable...

520
00:35:17,868 --> 00:35:20,913
and you're gonna get through this
Just fýne.

521
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:26,836
I hate the cello.

522
00:35:26,919 --> 00:35:29,380
Don't.

523
00:35:32,967 --> 00:35:37,513
I keep waiting for Candid Camera
to walk through the door.

524
00:35:37,596 --> 00:35:41,976
- What did you cancel for tonight?
- Box seats at Shea. You?

525
00:35:42,059 --> 00:35:44,478
Dinner with Cheryl.

526
00:35:46,731 --> 00:35:49,150
Two more days.

527
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:56,866
Where'd you put the baby powder?

528
00:35:56,949 --> 00:35:58,576
I'll get it.

529
00:35:58,659 --> 00:36:02,371
What'd you put it out there for? We're
bathing her in here. You should have
brought it in with her bath stuff.

530
00:36:02,455 --> 00:36:05,499
- It's just down the hall.
- Well, we're not bathing her
in the hall, are we?

531
00:36:05,583 --> 00:36:08,002
Well, maybe we should start, goddam it!

532
00:36:09,378 --> 00:36:11,797
You're going to clean that up.

533
00:36:15,384 --> 00:36:18,971
- What time are those guys
supposed to get here?
- Jack's message said before noon.

534
00:36:19,055 --> 00:36:21,390
Good. I gotta see my editor
about 1:00.

535
00:36:23,225 --> 00:36:26,645
Michael, did you move my blueprints? I
need 'em for my meeting this afternoon.

536
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,693
Sorry.

537
00:36:42,453 --> 00:36:45,498
I think she did a doodle.
Your turn to change her.

538
00:36:46,874 --> 00:36:49,585
I'll give you a thousand dollars
if you'll do it.

539
00:36:57,134 --> 00:36:59,428
Check this out.

540
00:37:00,763 --> 00:37:03,182
What do you know?

541
00:37:04,934 --> 00:37:07,353
Coming! Coming!

542
00:37:09,438 --> 00:37:11,857
- Does, uh, Jack Holden live here?
- Yeah.

543
00:37:11,941 --> 00:37:14,902
- Someone asked us to pick up a package.
- A package?

544
00:37:14,986 --> 00:37:18,531
I love the way everybody
keeps calling it a package.

545
00:37:18,614 --> 00:37:22,660
You can tell Sylvia for us
that she's got a lot of nerve
dumping her problems in our laps.

546
00:37:22,743 --> 00:37:25,621
- Who's Sylvia?
- When it fýrst got here,
we considered calling the cops.

547
00:37:25,705 --> 00:37:28,791
- Hey, w... Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait. No, no, w...
- But we didn't. We stuck it out, even
though it totally disrupted our lives.

548
00:37:28,874 --> 00:37:32,211
No, you wait. Hey, we haven't
been able to work or to sleep.

549
00:37:32,294 --> 00:37:34,880
- And there's been shit
all over this place for days.
- "Shit"?

550
00:37:34,964 --> 00:37:37,508
- What?
- You mean the package? It busted?

551
00:37:37,591 --> 00:37:40,511
Busted? Yeah.
Yeah, you could say that.

552
00:37:40,594 --> 00:37:44,682
- Well, did you put the shit back?
- Put it back? No, we had it bronzed for
posterity. What do you think we did?

553
00:37:44,765 --> 00:37:47,184
Michael.

554
00:37:49,645 --> 00:37:53,024
Her next bottle's in 45 minutes. I
made it up already. It's in the basket.

555
00:37:54,775 --> 00:37:57,403
- It's a baby.
- You're sharp, aren't ya?
He's all right, huh?

556
00:37:57,486 --> 00:38:00,489
Twenty minutes after she eats,
she gets tired. Put her to bed.

557
00:38:00,573 --> 00:38:04,410
- And I'm getting you a can
of powdered milk.
- Oh, yeah.

558
00:38:04,493 --> 00:38:08,998
- Yeah.
- Right. Powdered milk. Right.
- Yeah, powdered milk.

559
00:38:09,081 --> 00:38:13,377
So, all right, so we'll
take the "powdered milk"
and, uh, we'll get out of here.

560
00:38:23,429 --> 00:38:25,848
What, you want us to take the baby?

561
00:38:25,931 --> 00:38:28,434
That was the arrangement.

562
00:38:29,769 --> 00:38:33,564
- Are you sure that's the plan?
- You're damn straight.

563
00:38:33,647 --> 00:38:37,443
Well, if you say so. Let's go.

564
00:38:37,526 --> 00:38:40,404
- You won't forget what we said?
- No.

565
00:38:40,488 --> 00:38:43,658
And she likes to be
rocked to sleep. Gently.

566
00:38:43,741 --> 00:38:48,704
Gently. Absolutely. Gently.
L-I can handle it.

567
00:38:48,788 --> 00:38:52,458
Maybe you should leave a phone number,
in case you need some advice.

568
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:55,002
Oh, uh, I'll call you.

569
00:39:07,473 --> 00:39:12,895
Do you hear that, Peter?
Just listen. Isn't it wonderful?

570
00:39:12,978 --> 00:39:16,732
- Isn't what wonderful?
- Quiet.

571
00:39:16,816 --> 00:39:19,568
Peace and quiet.

572
00:39:19,652 --> 00:39:23,197
There's something screwy going on,
Michael. I got a funny feeling.

573
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,075
What are you talking about?
You've been tense the last fýve days.

574
00:39:26,158 --> 00:39:28,577
It's just your nerves unwinding.

575
00:39:31,038 --> 00:39:33,457
Maybe you're right.

576
00:39:45,845 --> 00:39:48,472
Michael.

577
00:39:51,475 --> 00:39:54,186
- Michael, what is this?
- A package.

578
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:56,981
- When did it get here?
- Sunday.

579
00:39:57,064 --> 00:40:00,943
- Mrs Hathaway br...
- Go to the window.
See if you can stop them.

580
00:40:01,027 --> 00:40:04,030
I gotta try and catch up with them!

581
00:40:10,786 --> 00:40:12,997
Hi. Hello.

582
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,458
Yeah, you're beautiful.
Come on. Wanna go for a ride?

583
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,798
Hey! Hey, up here!

584
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:35,144
- Where am I gonna put this little baby?
- Right on your lap.

585
00:40:35,227 --> 00:40:38,189
Huh? No, we need
a little baby car seat, I think.

586
00:40:38,272 --> 00:40:42,193
- Put her in the trunk.
- Yeah? You wanna go for a ride
in the car, in the trunk?

587
00:40:42,276 --> 00:40:44,570
Huh? Wanna go in the trunk?

588
00:40:53,037 --> 00:40:57,124
Oh, no. Oh, my God.

589
00:40:57,208 --> 00:41:00,252
Hey, hey. You wanna try this?
It's an adventure.

590
00:41:02,254 --> 00:41:06,884
Why am I listening to you? Why... Why do
I listen to you? I mean, this is absurd.
I can't put a little baby in the trunk.

591
00:41:08,427 --> 00:41:10,930
- Hey!
- It's okay. Yeah.

592
00:41:11,013 --> 00:41:13,057
- Oh, Mr Wonderful.
- Hey!

593
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,601
- Yeah?
- Look, uh, I gave you the wrong package.

594
00:41:15,685 --> 00:41:18,062
- W-W-What wrong package?
What are you talking...
- I made a... I made a terrible mistake.

595
00:41:18,145 --> 00:41:20,981
I gave you the wrong package.
Look, I've got... Give me the baby fýrst.

596
00:41:21,065 --> 00:41:23,275
- No. Hey, no... Take it easy. Be gentle.
- Give me the... Give me the baby fýrst.

597
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:26,153
- Give me the baby. Give me the baby.
- Be gentle. You're disturbing the baby.

598
00:41:26,237 --> 00:41:27,780
- Hey, hey, hey, what are you, crazy?
- Give me the baby fýrst.

599
00:41:27,863 --> 00:41:30,825
- Look, hey, Satch.
Hey, listen, this guy's an animal.
- Give me the baby! Please!

600
00:41:30,908 --> 00:41:33,285
I keep him chained to the wall.
I feed him raw meat.

601
00:41:33,369 --> 00:41:36,497
- Hey! What's goin' on here?
- Oh, God, it's Roy and Trigger.

602
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:39,208
- I said, what's goin' on here?
- Nothing, Offýcer.

603
00:41:39,291 --> 00:41:43,129
- You gonna ride
with that kid in the trunk?
- No! Of course not. That's absurd.

604
00:41:43,212 --> 00:41:46,382
I mean, it's unhealthy for the child,
and it's illegal also, I understand.

605
00:41:46,465 --> 00:41:48,009
- No, he's not, Offýcer.
Give me the baby.
- Yeah...

606
00:41:48,092 --> 00:41:51,137
- All right, let me see
your licence and registration.
- Why?

607
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:53,973
- Why?
- Yeah, why?
- 'Cause you're double-parked, wise guy!

608
00:41:54,056 --> 00:41:56,058
- Oh. Why... All right.
Wait a minute. What's...
- Give me the baby.

609
00:41:56,142 --> 00:41:59,645
Just be gentle. Be gentle. Be gentle.

610
00:41:59,729 --> 00:42:01,981
- Hey. Stay there.
- One second, Offýcer.
I'll be right with you.

611
00:42:04,025 --> 00:42:06,527
Book! Book! Book! Book!

612
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:09,822
Hey, come back here! You, freeze!

613
00:42:12,074 --> 00:42:16,287
I have no intention of moving, Offýcer.
I'm not a criminal, I'm an architect.

614
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:19,415
- W-With a baby. See?
- Ah, let me see some I.D.

615
00:42:19,498 --> 00:42:22,668
Oh, yeah, sure.

616
00:42:22,752 --> 00:42:26,213
- I don't have any with me.
- Up against the car. Spread 'em.

617
00:42:26,297 --> 00:42:29,008
Uh, Offýcer, look, uh, uh,
my wallet's up in my apartment.

618
00:42:29,091 --> 00:42:31,635
It's right up there. You can
come up with me. You're welcome to.

619
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:37,141
Uh, uh, l-I'll some you some I. D,
but I'm not gonna spread 'em because
I have a baby, as you can plainly see.

620
00:42:37,224 --> 00:42:39,643
All right, architect, let's go.

621
00:42:45,483 --> 00:42:48,944
Here we are. Come on in. Can I
get you a cup of coffee or something?

622
00:42:49,028 --> 00:42:51,072
No, thanks.
I'll just wait here by the door.

623
00:42:51,155 --> 00:42:54,075
Michael!
I'll just be a second.

624
00:42:54,158 --> 00:42:57,536
Come with me, Michael.
Here we go. I'm coming.

625
00:42:57,620 --> 00:43:01,791
Uh, just listen. The package
those guys came for is full of drugs.

626
00:43:01,874 --> 00:43:04,919
- What?
- Drugs. All right, here.

627
00:43:06,253 --> 00:43:08,756
- Coming. Do something with it.
- Like what?

628
00:43:08,839 --> 00:43:11,884
Hide it. I gotta show him some I.D.
I'm coming.

629
00:43:15,388 --> 00:43:20,309
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
There you are.
- Would you mind removing that
from the cover, please?

630
00:43:20,393 --> 00:43:24,063
- Well, sure.
- Thank you.

631
00:43:25,564 --> 00:43:28,567
Shh, shh. Shh, shh. Shh, shh, shh.

632
00:43:28,651 --> 00:43:32,071
Shh. Sure. Shh. Shh. Shh.

633
00:43:32,154 --> 00:43:35,199
Thanks for coming up, Offýcer.
I hope it hasn't been an inconvenience.

634
00:43:35,282 --> 00:43:37,743
And if there's anything else
I can do for you, just let me know.

635
00:43:37,827 --> 00:43:40,246
I was just doin' my job.

636
00:43:42,373 --> 00:43:47,294
Hi. I'm Detective Sergeant Melkowitz,
Narcotics.

637
00:43:47,378 --> 00:43:49,422
Offýcer, you can go down
and saddle up now.

638
00:43:49,505 --> 00:43:51,924
- Yes, sir.
- I'll handle this.

639
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:01,642
Aren't you gonna ask me in?

640
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:13,070
Can I, uh, get you a cup of coffee,
some water, a beer?

641
00:44:13,154 --> 00:44:15,531
No, no. No, thanks, I'm fýne.

642
00:44:15,614 --> 00:44:17,450
Ah.

643
00:44:17,533 --> 00:44:22,038
- You don't mind me asking
a few questions, do you?
- No, not at all.

644
00:44:22,121 --> 00:44:24,707
- Is that your baby
I saw you with downstairs?
- No.

645
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:27,209
Uh, well, um, it's my roommate Jack's.

646
00:44:27,293 --> 00:44:29,920
Well, who were those two men
I saw you talking to?

647
00:44:30,004 --> 00:44:34,800
Friends. Of the mother's.
They were gonna take her for a ride.

648
00:44:34,884 --> 00:44:37,303
The baby! Baby. Not the mother.

649
00:44:37,386 --> 00:44:40,765
But they couldn't, see,
because they brought the wrong car.
There's no baby seat.

650
00:44:42,433 --> 00:44:47,063
Well, do you mind if I have a look at
that baby? I just love little babies.

651
00:44:47,146 --> 00:44:50,650
She's sleeping.

652
00:44:50,733 --> 00:44:53,819
Sounds like she's awake to me.
Do you mind if I see her?

653
00:44:53,903 --> 00:44:56,822
I don't know. You know,
she doesn't really like strangers.

654
00:44:56,906 --> 00:45:00,534
- She may not be decent.
- Oh, I don't think she'll mind.

655
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:08,209
Well, there she is.
And she's got a friend.

656
00:45:08,292 --> 00:45:10,503
Oh, yeah,
this is my, uh, other roommate.

657
00:45:10,586 --> 00:45:12,880
Uh, Detective Melkowitz,
this is Michael Kellam.

658
00:45:12,963 --> 00:45:16,759
- Hello.
- Oh, what a cutie.

659
00:45:16,842 --> 00:45:18,969
Do you mind if I hold her?
I just love kids.

660
00:45:19,053 --> 00:45:21,305
Well, I'd rather not, actually.
She's, um...

661
00:45:21,389 --> 00:45:26,102
- Go ahead, Michael. It won't hurt her.
- Uh, well, you know how she is
around people, Peter. She's so...

662
00:45:26,185 --> 00:45:31,232
Michael, will you let him hold her.
He's not gonna hurt her.
He's a police offýcer.

663
00:45:31,315 --> 00:45:33,526
- All right.
- Oh.
- Yeah.

664
00:45:35,069 --> 00:45:37,905
Oh. Oh.

665
00:45:43,285 --> 00:45:46,163
You're a heavy little girl,
aren't you?

666
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:52,044
Yes. Yes, she really is heavy,
isn't she?

667
00:45:52,128 --> 00:45:54,505
- She's a good eater.
- Yeah. That's a good sign.

668
00:45:54,588 --> 00:45:57,883
It means she won't grow up
to be a nervous adult.

669
00:45:57,967 --> 00:46:01,220
You've got nothing to be nervous about,
have you, sweetie?

670
00:46:04,557 --> 00:46:07,143
- Feels as though
she's ready for a change.
- Oh.
- Yeah.

671
00:46:07,226 --> 00:46:10,396
- Oh. You know babies.
- Yep.
- All they do is eat, sleep and poop.

672
00:46:10,479 --> 00:46:13,149
- Here, Michael.
- Yeah, I'll take her.
- Good idea.

673
00:46:13,232 --> 00:46:15,943
Oh, what a cute little baby.

674
00:46:16,027 --> 00:46:18,237
Uh, do you happen to know
where her father is at the moment?

675
00:46:18,321 --> 00:46:22,199
- No. Uh, yeah, he's on location,
uh, doing a TV movie.
- Huh?

676
00:46:22,283 --> 00:46:25,870
- But l-I don't have any idea where.
- Uh, do you know this guy?

677
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:34,670
Oh, not very well. He's a friend of
Jack's. Uh, I don't remember his name.

678
00:46:34,754 --> 00:46:38,215
His name is Paul Milner.
He directs TV commercials.

679
00:46:38,299 --> 00:46:41,969
And on the side, he just happens to
dabble in a little heroin smuggling.

680
00:46:44,764 --> 00:46:48,351
- Really?
- Yeah.

681
00:46:48,434 --> 00:46:50,728
I don't know him. I don't...

682
00:46:50,811 --> 00:46:54,523
I'd appreciate that glass of water now,
Mr Mitchell.

683
00:46:54,607 --> 00:46:57,526
- Of course. No problem.
- Thank you.

684
00:46:59,904 --> 00:47:01,906
I got it.

685
00:47:13,751 --> 00:47:15,961
- Hi, this is Peter...
- Michael...
- and Jack.

686
00:47:16,045 --> 00:47:18,589
- We're out playing
and we can't come to the phone...
- But we'll call you back.

687
00:47:18,673 --> 00:47:21,425
- Shit!
- So please leave a message
at the sound of the tone.

688
00:47:21,509 --> 00:47:24,512
- Hold on. Whoever it is, I'm here.
- Uh, Peter! Jack.

689
00:47:24,595 --> 00:47:29,600
Yeah, how are you? L-Listen, uh,
I got a message saying you're trying
to get through to me. What's up?

690
00:47:29,684 --> 00:47:36,357
Jack, Michael and I really have to
talk to you, but, uh, uh, you called us
at a bad time. We'll call back later.

691
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:39,485
Wh-whoa, wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Don't hang up. I'm calling from Turkey.

692
00:47:39,568 --> 00:47:43,781
It took me an hour to put this call
through. It's not an easy place
to phone from, you know.

693
00:47:43,864 --> 00:47:46,367
Hey, Peter, this place is amazing.

694
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:49,537
You will not believe some of the stuff
I bought for you guys.

695
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:52,748
- Jack!
- I mean, the shit is so cheap here.

696
00:47:52,832 --> 00:47:55,960
I probably bought too much of it,
but what the hell,
I can always smuggle it in.

697
00:47:57,211 --> 00:47:59,296
- Just kidding.
- Jack, thanks for calling.

698
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:02,133
Uh, and we'll see you when you get back.

699
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:16,355
I gotta get him a glass of water
so his mouth doesn't go dry
when he reads me my rights.

700
00:48:21,402 --> 00:48:24,071
- Here you are, Sergeant.
- Oh, thanks.

701
00:48:35,291 --> 00:48:37,752
Goodbye.

702
00:48:37,835 --> 00:48:40,880
Nice talking to you.
It was very illuminating.

703
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,179
- He heard the phone call.
- We're dead.

704
00:48:48,262 --> 00:48:50,765
- You think Jack's involved in this?
- I don't know.

705
00:48:50,848 --> 00:48:53,267
We gotta talk to Paul Milner.

706
00:48:53,351 --> 00:48:55,853
- Why him?
- Because he is involved.

707
00:48:58,606 --> 00:49:00,775
Couldn't you think of somewhere better
to hide the drugs?

708
00:49:00,858 --> 00:49:03,486
Hey, it was perfect until you insisted
that he hold the baby.

709
00:49:03,569 --> 00:49:06,572
All right, you're right, Michael.
I'm sorry. Where'd you put 'em now?

710
00:49:06,656 --> 00:49:10,534
In the garbage pail
under the other dirty diapers.
Nobody's gonna look for it there.

711
00:49:10,618 --> 00:49:12,411
You realize we're in trouble
with this cop.

712
00:49:12,495 --> 00:49:15,915
You realize, of course, that
no one's coming back to get this kid.

713
00:49:15,998 --> 00:49:19,251
...is not in service.
- Jesus, you're right.

714
00:49:19,335 --> 00:49:21,587
We're stuck with her
until Jack gets back.

715
00:49:21,671 --> 00:49:24,840
It's disconnected.

716
00:49:24,924 --> 00:49:27,718
- Oh, I'm late.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute, so am I.

717
00:49:27,802 --> 00:49:29,887
Oh, damn it.

718
00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:31,972
Mr Kellam?

719
00:49:32,973 --> 00:49:35,893
Mr Mitchell?

720
00:49:37,853 --> 00:49:40,690
- Hello, Mrs Hathaway.
- Oh, Mr Mitchell.

721
00:49:40,773 --> 00:49:45,444
It seems that a horse
has befouled the front walk.
Do you know anything about it?

722
00:49:47,154 --> 00:49:50,992
- Mrs Hathaway, how nice to see you.
- Really nice to see you.

723
00:49:51,075 --> 00:49:53,452
Oh.

724
00:49:53,536 --> 00:49:55,705
- She can sit till 5:00.
- Well, I'll try and hurry.

725
00:49:55,788 --> 00:49:59,041
Me too. I'm worried.

726
00:50:02,586 --> 00:50:06,549
- I got the one with the mustache.
- I'll call Sergeant Melkowitz
and tell him we're moving.

727
00:50:06,632 --> 00:50:08,551
Right.

728
00:50:20,855 --> 00:50:22,857
There.

729
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:34,785
Here you go, pal.
What can I do for ya?

730
00:50:34,869 --> 00:50:39,415
I'd like, uh, Sports Illustrated,
Popular Science, some of this gum...

731
00:50:39,498 --> 00:50:42,001
and that giraffe up there.

732
00:50:42,084 --> 00:50:45,421
- Which one's the giraffe?
- The rubber one.

733
00:50:45,504 --> 00:50:48,215
That's not a giraffe.
That's a dinosaur.

734
00:50:48,299 --> 00:50:52,053
- Whatever.
- You mean the one with
the little polka dots up there?

735
00:50:52,136 --> 00:50:54,638
- Yes, uh, thank you.
- That's a dinosaur.
A giraffe has big ears.

736
00:50:54,722 --> 00:50:58,434
- I don't care whether it has ears
or not. Just give me the damn thing.
- It's got little ears. It's a dinosaur.

737
00:51:00,102 --> 00:51:03,230
- Hey, what about your change?
- Never mind.
- What about your change, pal?

738
00:51:22,875 --> 00:51:26,629
He left at 4:00.
He'll be back on Thursday.

739
00:51:26,712 --> 00:51:30,007
Mrs Hathaway.
Mrs Hathaway, I'm home.

740
00:51:34,261 --> 00:51:37,014
Mrs Hathaway.
Mrs Hathaway, where's Mary?

741
00:51:37,098 --> 00:51:39,517
- I don't know. I don't know.
- Where's Mary?

742
00:51:42,228 --> 00:51:44,313
Mary?

743
00:51:44,397 --> 00:51:46,190
Oh, my God.

744
00:51:47,608 --> 00:51:50,111
Mary! Mary!

745
00:51:51,696 --> 00:51:53,489
Mary.

746
00:51:56,325 --> 00:51:58,119
Mary!

747
00:51:59,578 --> 00:52:01,372
Mary!

748
00:52:03,374 --> 00:52:05,167
Mary!

749
00:52:09,505 --> 00:52:11,298
Mary!

750
00:52:25,688 --> 00:52:28,107
Thank God.

751
00:52:32,194 --> 00:52:35,156
Thank God.

752
00:52:35,239 --> 00:52:38,784
No, everything's fýne, darling.
Everything's fýne.

753
00:52:38,868 --> 00:52:41,287
Don't you worry.

754
00:52:43,247 --> 00:52:46,584
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
No. It's okay.

755
00:52:46,667 --> 00:52:49,879
Peter? Peter!

756
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,841
She's okay. She's not hurt.

757
00:52:57,928 --> 00:53:00,890
- How are you?
- I'm fýne. Just...

758
00:53:02,224 --> 00:53:06,020
See what those bastards did
to my videotapes?

759
00:53:06,103 --> 00:53:08,522
We got a message.

760
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:12,276
What'd it say?

761
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:14,862
"Next time we'll take the baby."

762
00:53:14,945 --> 00:53:19,033
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Mr Kellam.

763
00:53:20,451 --> 00:53:23,120
Mr Mitchell!

764
00:53:23,204 --> 00:53:26,999
"The champ caught Smith
with a savage left hook...

765
00:53:27,083 --> 00:53:31,337
"that sent the challenger
crashing into the ropes.

766
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:38,719
"Smith, his left eye swollen
and the cut above his right eye
now much more bloody...

767
00:53:38,803 --> 00:53:42,390
countered with a barrage
of vicious body blows."

768
00:53:42,473 --> 00:53:47,186
- What are you reading her?
- It doesn't matter what I read.

769
00:53:47,269 --> 00:53:49,730
It's the tone you use.

770
00:53:49,814 --> 00:53:53,317
She doesn't understand the words anyway.
Now, where were we?

771
00:53:53,401 --> 00:53:57,196
"The champ began the fýfth round...

772
00:53:57,279 --> 00:54:00,282
"like a man possessed...

773
00:54:00,366 --> 00:54:04,620
"going straight for
his opponent's body...

774
00:54:04,704 --> 00:54:07,123
with ferocious energy."

775
00:54:14,505 --> 00:54:16,924
Here you go, darlin'.

776
00:55:52,061 --> 00:55:54,605
Stupid... I can't believe...

777
00:56:01,988 --> 00:56:05,825
My face! Watch out for my face!
Peter, it's me, Jack!

778
00:56:05,908 --> 00:56:08,160
- Jack!
- Jesus, Jack!

779
00:56:08,244 --> 00:56:11,539
- Get up!
- No, wait...
- W-What are you... Get him off!
- You irresponsible... Come here!

780
00:56:11,622 --> 00:56:15,042
- What is it with you guys?
- We should be asking you that question!

781
00:56:15,126 --> 00:56:18,796
- Why? What'd I do?
- What the hell are you doing
back so soon anyway?

782
00:56:18,879 --> 00:56:21,340
- My part got cut. Okay?
- Good!

783
00:56:21,424 --> 00:56:23,926
What is with him? Wh... Je...

784
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:28,097
Look at this place.
Will somebody please tell me
what the hell is goin' on around here?

785
00:56:30,016 --> 00:56:33,060
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, shit!

786
00:56:33,144 --> 00:56:36,439
What was that?
No, I'm not goin' anywhere
until you tell me what's goin' on.

787
00:56:36,522 --> 00:56:39,150
- We'll be glad to.
- That really hurt, Peter.

788
00:56:39,233 --> 00:56:43,321
- Ow, ow, ow.
- Sunday morning
I come back from jogging...

789
00:56:43,404 --> 00:56:48,784
to fýnd this basket with this baby in it
waiting in the vestibule.

790
00:56:48,868 --> 00:56:52,204
- Well, why...
- Inside is a little note
from a Sylvia...

791
00:56:52,288 --> 00:56:55,708
saying that the baby was yours
and she was leaving it here
for you to deal with it.

792
00:56:55,791 --> 00:56:59,670
- M-Mine?
- Then along comes another little
package with your name on it...

793
00:56:59,754 --> 00:57:02,548
only this time
the package has heroin in it...

794
00:57:02,631 --> 00:57:06,552
and the narcotics squad permanently
camped downstairs knows all about it.

795
00:57:06,635 --> 00:57:11,349
The cops? I don't believe this.
I don't know anything about any drugs
or any police.

796
00:57:11,432 --> 00:57:15,436
I mean, I thought
I was just doing a favour for Paul.
I didn't know what was in that package.

797
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:17,521
And I certainly don't know anything
about that baby.

798
00:57:17,605 --> 00:57:23,653
I mean, for God's sake, somebody
drops a baby off on, on your doorstep,
and you automatically assume he's mine?

799
00:57:23,736 --> 00:57:26,489
Look, the child doesn't look
anything like me.

800
00:57:28,074 --> 00:57:31,160
I'm bigger and, and I have more hair.

801
00:57:31,243 --> 00:57:36,165
"Dear Jack, Here is our baby.
I can't handle this now.
I don't know where else to turn. S..."

802
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:40,670
Sylvia? Oh, my...

803
00:57:40,753 --> 00:57:44,465
Oh, my God. Stratford.
Ayear and a ha...

804
00:57:44,548 --> 00:57:47,760
Ayear and a half ago.

805
00:57:47,843 --> 00:57:50,554
I was doing Taming of the Shrew.
She was the shrew.

806
00:57:50,638 --> 00:57:54,183
I mean, I did some of
my best work in that.

807
00:57:54,266 --> 00:57:57,687
- I got great reviews.
- Jack, you're such a jerk.

808
00:57:57,770 --> 00:58:02,358
- You're always thinkin' about yourself.
I wanna kill you.
- Michael, you won't have to.

809
00:58:02,441 --> 00:58:07,697
Jack, I would like to introduce you
to your daughter Mary.

810
00:58:11,117 --> 00:58:16,247
Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute,
you guys. You can't be sure
that this is my kid. Uh... Um...

811
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:22,086
- What the hell am I
supposed to do with it?
- We've put our lives on hold, Jack,
taking care of this kid...

812
00:58:22,169 --> 00:58:25,506
and now it's your turn.

813
00:58:27,258 --> 00:58:29,760
Okay. All right. All right, fýne.

814
00:58:30,886 --> 00:58:35,683
All right, until I straighten this mess
out, I'll, uh, I'll take care of her.

815
00:58:35,766 --> 00:58:38,477
I mean, sure, why not?

816
00:58:38,561 --> 00:58:41,605
I'm an actor.
I can, uh, I can do a father.

817
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:47,695
Yeah. Yeah. See, huh?
What could be so diffýcult, huh? Yeah.

818
00:58:47,778 --> 00:58:51,365
- Goodnight, Jack.
- Goodnight, Jack.
- Goodnight. Goodnight.

819
00:58:51,449 --> 00:58:54,452
Oh. Down we go.

820
00:58:54,535 --> 00:58:57,163
W-W-Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
What-What's the matter with her?

821
00:58:57,246 --> 00:58:59,999
- Goodnight, Jack.
- Goodnight, Jack.

822
00:59:06,339 --> 00:59:10,426
Hold still, kid. Gee... Hey, how do you
put on these goddam things anyway?

823
00:59:10,509 --> 00:59:13,763
Figure it out for yourself,
dickhead.

824
00:59:13,846 --> 00:59:16,182
- Nice shot.
- Look at that stuff. Oh, my God!

825
00:59:16,265 --> 00:59:18,768
What are you guys feeding her, huh?
Oh, no, no, please!

826
00:59:18,851 --> 00:59:21,896
Not on the silk sheets.
Not on the silk sheets. Please, please!

827
00:59:21,979 --> 00:59:24,857
Maybe I should show him
how to put on the diaper.

828
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:29,528
Oh, no. I don't believe this.
Why me? Oh, come on, baby.

829
00:59:29,612 --> 00:59:33,532
Nope. Let's give him
another half hour.

830
00:59:33,616 --> 00:59:36,035
Let him suffer.

831
00:59:38,037 --> 00:59:41,290
Yes, yes, I'm trying
to reach Paul Milner.

832
00:59:41,374 --> 00:59:44,251
No, he was supposed to be
in San Francisco, but I can't fýnd him.

833
00:59:44,335 --> 00:59:49,173
Wo-Would you please tell him to call
Jack Holden as soon as he gets in?

834
00:59:49,256 --> 00:59:52,635
- Is this urgent?
- Yeah, urgent's an understatement.

835
00:59:53,761 --> 00:59:56,180
Lady.

836
00:59:58,057 --> 01:00:01,310
I don't know why I bother giving you
this. It just goes right through you.

837
01:00:01,394 --> 01:00:03,688
- Did you get a hold of your friend?
- No.

838
01:00:03,771 --> 01:00:06,691
- Don't forget to bolt the door.
- I won't.

839
01:00:06,774 --> 01:00:10,361
And remember, there's
a quarter of a million dollars
in heroin in that diaper pail.

840
01:00:10,444 --> 01:00:12,989
- And the new baby wipes
are in the cabinet.
- Right.

841
01:00:13,072 --> 01:00:16,450
Heroin's in the diaper pail.
Baby wipes are in the cabinet.

842
01:00:16,534 --> 01:00:19,745
Where else would they be?
I can't believe this.

843
01:00:19,829 --> 01:00:24,125
You're kidding me. Thirty-two
Benningtons i-in the London area?

844
01:00:24,208 --> 01:00:27,169
Yes, sir.

845
01:00:27,253 --> 01:00:30,923
Uh, uh, uh, I'll get back to you.
L-l...

846
01:00:32,049 --> 01:00:34,468
Oh, boy.

847
01:00:34,552 --> 01:00:38,347
Oh, baby. Look, l-I know.
I know. I know. Yes.

848
01:00:38,431 --> 01:00:40,850
Yes, yes, yes.

849
01:00:45,479 --> 01:00:48,733
Oh, God. Y-Yeah.

850
01:00:48,816 --> 01:00:51,736
Well, we tried your mommy.
Maybe I should, uh...

851
01:00:51,819 --> 01:00:54,864
Maybe I should try mine, huh?

852
01:00:58,868 --> 01:01:01,287
Yeah.

853
01:01:03,581 --> 01:01:05,833
Mom?

854
01:01:05,916 --> 01:01:08,836
- Well, where is she?
- Oh, Mom, wait till you see her.

855
01:01:08,919 --> 01:01:12,006
Oh, you won't believe this.
She is so beautiful.

856
01:01:12,089 --> 01:01:14,425
She looks just like you.

857
01:01:14,508 --> 01:01:17,803
- You know, you boys live like pigs.
- Oh, Mom.

858
01:01:17,887 --> 01:01:19,889
Look, look. There.
Isn't she beautiful?

859
01:01:19,972 --> 01:01:23,809
There she is.
Look at that little baby!

860
01:01:23,893 --> 01:01:25,645
- Yeah.
- You're such a pretty little girl.

861
01:01:25,728 --> 01:01:27,855
Will you come to me?
I'm gonna pick you right up.

862
01:01:27,938 --> 01:01:30,733
- Yes, I'm gonna pick you right up.
- Oh, I am in awe. I mean, look at you.

863
01:01:30,816 --> 01:01:32,860
You-You pick her up like a pro.

864
01:01:32,943 --> 01:01:35,488
I pick her up like a grandmother.

865
01:01:35,571 --> 01:01:38,074
It's called experience.
Darling.

866
01:01:38,157 --> 01:01:41,619
Let's see you. Oh, she's so lovely.
What's her name?

867
01:01:41,702 --> 01:01:44,288
- Mary.
- Mary.

868
01:01:44,372 --> 01:01:47,667
Well, Mary!

869
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:50,378
Look at the way
she's looking at me.

870
01:01:51,671 --> 01:01:56,425
- For a moment there, I had her laughing.
- Yeah, just like me, huh?

871
01:01:56,509 --> 01:01:59,303
Don't ruin this for me, Jack.

872
01:01:59,387 --> 01:02:01,847
- Oh!
- Oh, she adores you!

873
01:02:01,931 --> 01:02:04,850
- You... Well, well, well.
- She knows that you're her grandmother.

874
01:02:04,934 --> 01:02:08,104
It's like a... It's like a biological
thing, an instant connection.

875
01:02:08,187 --> 01:02:11,023
Cut the crap, Jack.
What do you want?

876
01:02:12,608 --> 01:02:16,028
Mom, I can't take care of her.

877
01:02:16,112 --> 01:02:18,114
I don't know what to do.

878
01:02:18,197 --> 01:02:20,783
I was kinda hoping that... that maybe you
could take her, just for a little while.

879
01:02:20,866 --> 01:02:23,452
Not forever. You know,
until she's ready to vote.

880
01:02:23,536 --> 01:02:28,666
Oh, I would love to.
Do you know, Jack?

881
01:02:28,749 --> 01:02:32,253
Some people live all their lives...

882
01:02:32,336 --> 01:02:35,631
without having anything as wonderful
as this to show for it?

883
01:02:35,715 --> 01:02:40,428
- I know, Mom.
- So I'm gonna do the most wonderful
thing in the world for you.

884
01:02:40,511 --> 01:02:43,848
Absolutely nothing.

885
01:02:43,931 --> 01:02:46,434
Why?

886
01:02:46,517 --> 01:02:49,395
Jack, you've always run away
from responsibility.

887
01:02:49,478 --> 01:02:52,857
Now you have to turn and face it.

888
01:02:54,942 --> 01:02:58,612
Mom, I'm a screw-up.

889
01:02:58,696 --> 01:03:01,574
You were a screw-up.
Now you're a father.

890
01:03:02,908 --> 01:03:05,661
And you'll be a fýne one.

891
01:03:07,038 --> 01:03:09,415
- You think so?
- I know it.

892
01:03:13,627 --> 01:03:16,505
Your father, God rest his soul...

893
01:03:16,589 --> 01:03:19,842
he was a screw-up
and he turned out just fýne.

894
01:03:19,925 --> 01:03:22,553
- Really?
- Don't you remember?

895
01:03:22,636 --> 01:03:25,973
- Well, yeah, I guess.
- Now, give me a kiss.

896
01:03:27,725 --> 01:03:30,061
Mary, give me a kiss.

897
01:03:31,479 --> 01:03:36,192
And now, you and your friends
clean this place up.

898
01:03:36,275 --> 01:03:39,945
If not for yourselves,
do it for my granddaughter.

899
01:03:40,029 --> 01:03:42,365
- We-We will. We will.
- Bye.

900
01:03:42,448 --> 01:03:44,867
Bye. Thanks anyway, Mom.

901
01:03:46,827 --> 01:03:50,915
Well, looks like it's just
you and me now, kid.

902
01:03:50,998 --> 01:03:53,376
What? Mama.

903
01:03:55,628 --> 01:03:58,839
Oh, Jack? There's four bottles
prepared already.

904
01:03:58,923 --> 01:04:00,925
So you should be fýne
till tomorrow morning.

905
01:04:01,008 --> 01:04:03,094
And if her bottom gets red,
you just give her a bottle of water.

906
01:04:03,177 --> 01:04:05,638
Works miracles.
In about three hours, white as marble.

907
01:04:05,721 --> 01:04:07,807
We'll be in seats D-11,
12, 13 and 14.

908
01:04:07,890 --> 01:04:11,352
Yeah, if there's a problem, just call.
The usher will come and get us. Oh!

909
01:04:11,435 --> 01:04:13,854
Here's the number.

910
01:04:15,773 --> 01:04:18,442
- Wait a minute.
Are you leaving right now?
- Yeah, now.

911
01:04:18,526 --> 01:04:20,820
- When are you coming back?
- About midnight.

912
01:04:20,903 --> 01:04:23,656
All right. Don't worry about us.
Wait a minute. Is this a four?

913
01:04:23,739 --> 01:04:26,158
Yeah, it's a four.

914
01:04:28,995 --> 01:04:31,414
It's good to have.

915
01:04:33,124 --> 01:04:35,209
So, uh, what do you want to do?

916
01:04:43,217 --> 01:04:46,178
You know, this show's been running
longer than Mary's been alive?

917
01:04:46,262 --> 01:04:48,973
Peter, we agreed not to mention
her name tonight, right?

918
01:04:49,056 --> 01:04:52,101
- Right. My mistake.
- Who did you guys con
into sitting for you?

919
01:04:52,184 --> 01:04:55,313
- Jack.
- Jack? Daddy?

920
01:04:59,567 --> 01:05:01,986
Patty.

921
01:05:07,325 --> 01:05:10,870
Are you hungry? Huh?
Well, we're in luck here.

922
01:05:10,953 --> 01:05:12,955
Uh, oh-ho-ho!

923
01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:15,541
Tonight, uh, the chef has, uh...

924
01:05:15,624 --> 01:05:17,835
cooked up something
very special for you.

925
01:05:17,918 --> 01:05:20,588
He has taken the juice
of one cow...

926
01:05:20,671 --> 01:05:24,050
and, uh, sauteed it,
uh, with a fýne sauce.

927
01:05:24,133 --> 01:05:27,678
It is, uh, presented
surrounded by a bottle...

928
01:05:27,762 --> 01:05:31,974
and topped off, uh, with
a delicious rubber nipple, huh?

929
01:05:32,058 --> 01:05:35,186
Oh-ho. Yes.
Oh, excellent choice. Yes, yes.

930
01:05:35,269 --> 01:05:38,731
Here we go. Oh, yes.

931
01:05:40,149 --> 01:05:42,568
Wh-What?

932
01:05:43,694 --> 01:05:46,238
Here you go. Come on.

933
01:05:48,199 --> 01:05:50,618
Please?

934
01:05:52,286 --> 01:05:54,872
You don't want it, huh?

935
01:05:58,668 --> 01:06:02,380
Yeah, I just changed you. Huh?

936
01:06:02,463 --> 01:06:06,133
And you're not hungry.
What else is there in life?

937
01:06:13,140 --> 01:06:15,726
I always wanted to be
a musical comedy star.

938
01:06:15,810 --> 01:06:17,645
- Did you ever try?
- No.

939
01:06:22,441 --> 01:06:26,779
Ladies and gentlemen,
act two will begin in three minutes.

940
01:06:26,862 --> 01:06:29,573
Three minutes.

941
01:06:29,657 --> 01:06:32,118
Michael, have you
ever done any acting?

942
01:06:32,201 --> 01:06:35,830
No. No, I leave that to Jack.
The idiot.

943
01:06:41,043 --> 01:06:44,588
I got sunshine on a cloudy day

944
01:06:44,672 --> 01:06:48,968
When it's cold outside
I've got the month of May

945
01:06:49,051 --> 01:06:52,972
I guess you say

946
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:57,852
What can make me feel this way
My girl

947
01:06:57,935 --> 01:07:00,730
But maybe he fell asleep.
Maybe he fell and hit his head.

948
01:07:00,813 --> 01:07:03,607
He's probably unconscious.

949
01:07:03,691 --> 01:07:06,110
- Will you come on? It's started.
- It's terrible, terrible.

950
01:07:06,193 --> 01:07:07,945
- I had a great time.
- I'll see you at P.J.'s later.

951
01:07:08,029 --> 01:07:10,865
Oh, you can sing us a song
from the second act, okay?

952
01:07:10,948 --> 01:07:13,200
Are they always this strange?

953
01:07:13,284 --> 01:07:17,455
Yes, since they got involved
with another woman.

954
01:07:19,206 --> 01:07:22,501
Wasn't that fun, huh? Yeah.
Oh, cover that.

955
01:07:22,585 --> 01:07:25,046
- Jack?
- Jack, where are you?

956
01:07:25,129 --> 01:07:28,632
- Jack!
- I'm right here. What? What?

957
01:07:28,716 --> 01:07:32,511
- What are you doing?
- Well, what's it look
like I'm doing, Peter?

958
01:07:32,595 --> 01:07:35,598
- Is everything all right?
- Everything's fýne, yeah.

959
01:07:35,681 --> 01:07:38,142
Why you guys back so soon
anyway, huh?

960
01:07:38,225 --> 01:07:41,437
Uh, we thought that we might
have left the stove on.

961
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:43,522
No, no. The stove's not on.

962
01:07:43,606 --> 01:07:47,610
I think that Uncle Peter
and Uncle Michael are having
a nervous breakdown, yes.

963
01:07:47,693 --> 01:07:52,823
I called, Jack.
I let the phone ring for fýve minutes.

964
01:07:52,907 --> 01:07:57,411
- Why didn't you answer the phone?
- Well, because Mary and I
were taking a shower.

965
01:07:57,495 --> 01:07:59,664
Weren't we?
Yeah, we didn't hear anything.

966
01:07:59,747 --> 01:08:04,210
Yeah. Yeah.
Isn't that the truth, mademoiselle?

967
01:08:04,293 --> 01:08:05,878
Yes.

968
01:08:09,173 --> 01:08:10,716
Oh, you are cute, yes.

969
01:08:11,384 --> 01:08:14,053
I never put a phone
in a shower before.

970
01:08:14,136 --> 01:08:17,014
- You get many calls in here?
- A steady stream.

971
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:22,853
- What if you slipped down there?
- Well, I did try.

972
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:28,567
- We did pretty well
for the fýrst time out.
- Yeah.

973
01:08:33,114 --> 01:08:35,533
- Here.
- What?

974
01:08:38,786 --> 01:08:41,122
"Commercial director hospitalized
after mugging."

975
01:08:41,205 --> 01:08:44,333
- What?
- Yeah, take a look at this.
This is your friend, Paul Milner.

976
01:08:44,417 --> 01:08:46,419
"Don't let this happen to you.

977
01:08:46,502 --> 01:08:48,921
"Be at the phone booth at the corner
of 81 st and Columbus...

978
01:08:49,005 --> 01:08:51,007
at exactly 8:00 p.m. Tonight."

979
01:08:52,967 --> 01:08:55,136
They're trying to intimidate us.
I hate that.

980
01:08:55,219 --> 01:08:58,723
- I've had enough of this doo-doo.
- I want to fýnish this, okay?

981
01:09:11,694 --> 01:09:14,071
Hello?

982
01:09:14,155 --> 01:09:17,158
Yeah, we got your message.

983
01:09:17,241 --> 01:09:19,785
Uh-uh. No good.

984
01:09:19,869 --> 01:09:22,163
We do it our way.

985
01:09:22,246 --> 01:09:26,792
Because we got the stuff,
and if you don't do it our way...

986
01:09:26,876 --> 01:09:30,338
- Come on.
- Say it, say it.

987
01:09:32,089 --> 01:09:34,592
We flush it down the toilet!

988
01:09:34,675 --> 01:09:38,054
Okay, now listen, and listen good.

989
01:09:38,137 --> 01:09:40,306
There's a... a construction site.

990
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:31,107
Car 20 following suspects,
southbound Central Park West.

991
01:10:47,248 --> 01:10:50,001
Come on, Peter!

992
01:10:57,299 --> 01:11:00,803
- Damn it, Joe! We lost 'em!
- I got it. Three blocks, turn around.

993
01:11:02,138 --> 01:11:05,891
That was great. That was great.
Everybody remember what they're
supposed to do?

994
01:11:05,975 --> 01:11:07,977
Oh, come on, Peter.
It's not that complicated a plan.

995
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:10,271
Yeah, next he's gonna want us
to synchronize our watches, right?

996
01:11:10,354 --> 01:11:13,232
Should we do that?

997
01:11:29,999 --> 01:11:32,168
Yes, thank you.

998
01:11:32,251 --> 01:11:35,713
Hello, Sergeant Melkowitz.
Uh, my name is Jack Holden.

999
01:11:35,796 --> 01:11:37,798
I think you know my two roommates.

1000
01:11:37,882 --> 01:11:41,093
I must have been crazy
to agree to this. Goddam.

1001
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:45,556
- Orange elevator. Here it is.
- Right.

1002
01:11:56,817 --> 01:11:59,528
Close door.

1003
01:12:03,574 --> 01:12:05,576
- Okay, 15, please.
- Fifteen?

1004
01:12:05,660 --> 01:12:08,954
Yeah. I'm all fýlthy
and everything.

1005
01:12:28,265 --> 01:12:32,478
What's wrong, my sweetheart?
Come here. What is it, huh?

1006
01:12:32,561 --> 01:12:34,981
Sweetie.

1007
01:12:36,732 --> 01:12:40,903
Oh. Well, you should have
told me before we left.

1008
01:12:42,947 --> 01:12:46,701
Oh, boy, this is not a...
this is not a good time to do this.

1009
01:12:46,784 --> 01:12:48,869
Hold still.

1010
01:12:48,953 --> 01:12:51,539
Oh, you make such a...
There you go.

1011
01:12:53,874 --> 01:12:56,002
Michael.

1012
01:12:56,085 --> 01:12:58,504
They're here.

1013
01:13:00,006 --> 01:13:02,299
- Hey, look. Hey, you know,
this is really aggravating.
- I'm here.

1014
01:13:02,383 --> 01:13:05,094
- I'm here by the pipes.
- You know, I don't have
a lot of time, but, uh...

1015
01:13:05,177 --> 01:13:07,888
- Hold it.
- What, what, what?
- Hold it! All right, just hold it.

1016
01:13:07,972 --> 01:13:11,058
Look, where is the stuff?
Will you give it to me?

1017
01:13:11,142 --> 01:13:13,311
- It's in the elevator.
- Oh, bullshit.

1018
01:13:13,394 --> 01:13:16,439
Uh, i-it's in the control panel.
Uh, check for yourself.

1019
01:13:16,522 --> 01:13:19,442
What am I supposed to do,
bring my handy little tool kit here?

1020
01:13:19,525 --> 01:13:22,236
You realize that, uh...

1021
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:25,031
we had absolutely nothing
to do with this.

1022
01:13:25,114 --> 01:13:27,950
We had no idea
what was in the package.

1023
01:13:28,034 --> 01:13:30,953
Yeah, no kidding. I mean, I could have
fýgured that out in about four seconds.

1024
01:13:31,037 --> 01:13:34,123
I mean, you know, you guys
don't behave like a couple of pros.

1025
01:13:34,206 --> 01:13:36,709
- You know what I mean?
- Right.
- Yeah.

1026
01:13:36,792 --> 01:13:39,211
- We're not pros.
- I just said that, didn't I?

1027
01:13:39,295 --> 01:13:41,380
I'm sensitive to that.

1028
01:13:41,464 --> 01:13:43,799
I mean, why do you make it
so complicated?

1029
01:13:44,925 --> 01:13:48,596
- We've never done this.
- I got it.
- Great.

1030
01:13:48,679 --> 01:13:52,183
You're forgiven this time.

1031
01:13:52,266 --> 01:13:54,852
Very wise of you to cooperate,
fýnally.

1032
01:13:54,935 --> 01:13:58,481
- Glad it's over.
- No-No happier than I am, believe me.

1033
01:13:58,564 --> 01:14:02,443
I mean, dealing with, uh, amateurs
is a real pain in the ass.

1034
01:14:02,526 --> 01:14:05,279
- So is dealing with professionals.
- No doubt.

1035
01:14:08,866 --> 01:14:11,952
Hey, what is that?

1036
01:14:12,036 --> 01:14:15,539
- What, are you abusing
my trust here or what?
- Whoa!

1037
01:14:15,623 --> 01:14:17,625
- There's someone in there!
- Come on.

1038
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:24,590
Come on, Michael.

1039
01:14:24,674 --> 01:14:26,926
- Oh, no.
- Oh, look... look out.

1040
01:14:35,935 --> 01:14:37,895
- I lost my balance.
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1041
01:14:37,979 --> 01:14:41,399
- Did you get it?
- Yeah. Yeah, I got it!
- We got 'em!

1042
01:14:52,243 --> 01:14:55,705
Who's doing this? Huh?
I want that camera, punk!

1043
01:14:59,041 --> 01:15:03,462
- There's six switches!
- Aw, these guys wrecked my day.

1044
01:15:10,136 --> 01:15:12,138
- Jack!
- What the hell happened?

1045
01:15:12,221 --> 01:15:15,850
- He hit the wrong button.
- He what?

1046
01:15:15,933 --> 01:15:18,185
- Can it go any faster or what?
- This is it.

1047
01:15:18,269 --> 01:15:23,441
- Huh? Come on. You punks!
- Jack!

1048
01:15:23,524 --> 01:15:27,445
- Jack!
- Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.

1049
01:15:27,528 --> 01:15:31,532
I want that home movie.
I'll wait for you. I want that movie.

1050
01:15:32,742 --> 01:15:36,829
- Oh, no.
- Jack!

1051
01:15:36,912 --> 01:15:40,583
- Hit the button on the left!
- The button on the left, Jack!

1052
01:15:40,666 --> 01:15:44,253
- What? What?
- Hit the button on the left!

1053
01:15:44,337 --> 01:15:47,048
There is no left. The le...

1054
01:15:48,674 --> 01:15:51,302
- Come on, get it going faster,
will ya? Is that it?
- I can't.

1055
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:55,514
Please.

1056
01:15:55,598 --> 01:15:58,017
- Hey, why are we stopped?
What's the matter? Huh?
- I don't understand.

1057
01:15:58,100 --> 01:15:59,644
- Why is this elevator stopped?
- What do you want? It's dead.
The whole thing's no good.

1058
01:15:59,727 --> 01:16:02,271
I got 'em!

1059
01:16:02,355 --> 01:16:04,523
- It ain't running.
It just ain't running.
- What's going on?

1060
01:16:04,607 --> 01:16:08,110
- Did you hit the button? Jesus.
- Yeah, it's dead.
- Oh, boy.

1061
01:16:08,194 --> 01:16:11,697
Uncle Peter and Uncle Michael are
gonna be plenty ticked off with Daddy.

1062
01:16:16,619 --> 01:16:19,914
- Aren't you glad he's on our side?
- What happened? What happened?
Can you get...

1063
01:16:19,997 --> 01:16:22,124
You wait for me.
I know where you live, man!

1064
01:16:43,312 --> 01:16:46,899
- Oh, no, no, Vince.
- Oh, why? Why is this happening?

1065
01:16:46,983 --> 01:16:50,277
- Oh, no!
- Why is this happening? Why?

1066
01:16:50,361 --> 01:16:52,363
Okay. It's okay, guys. It's okay.

1067
01:16:55,032 --> 01:16:58,536
Hi. Um, are you Sergeant Melkowitz?

1068
01:16:58,619 --> 01:17:01,205
- Yeah.
- Oh, good.

1069
01:17:01,288 --> 01:17:04,208
- Are you... Are you the father?
- Yes. Yes, yes, I am.

1070
01:17:04,291 --> 01:17:06,794
Hey! Oh, thanks for the phone call.

1071
01:17:06,877 --> 01:17:09,296
Oh, actually it was, uh,
Peter's idea. Hi, guys.

1072
01:17:09,380 --> 01:17:11,382
- She's okay, she's okay.
- Hello, Sergeant.

1073
01:17:11,465 --> 01:17:14,844
- The guys you want are in that elevator.
- The drugs are up there too.

1074
01:17:14,927 --> 01:17:18,055
- Everything you need
to know is right here.
- It's very illuminating.

1075
01:17:18,139 --> 01:17:20,224
Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot.

1076
01:17:20,308 --> 01:17:22,059
If I have any questions,
I know where to reach you guys.

1077
01:17:22,143 --> 01:17:24,145
- Yeah.
- Okay, fellas.
- Let's get 'em, Jimmy.

1078
01:17:24,228 --> 01:17:27,148
- Hey, can I hold the baby, huh?
- No.

1079
01:17:27,231 --> 01:17:30,443
- No.
- Oh, I guess not.

1080
01:17:33,571 --> 01:17:37,491
When the sun goes down
and it's getting late

1081
01:17:37,575 --> 01:17:40,703
You say it's time for bed

1082
01:17:42,121 --> 01:17:46,542
Shejust takes her time
acting like she never

1083
01:17:46,625 --> 01:17:50,338
Heard a word you said

1084
01:17:51,922 --> 01:17:56,218
Little baby
want to hold you tight

1085
01:17:56,302 --> 01:18:00,681
She don't ever wanna
say goodnight

1086
01:18:00,765 --> 01:18:05,978
She's in love
She want to be Daddy's girl

1087
01:18:08,439 --> 01:18:12,693
When the morning comes
and it's time to go

1088
01:18:12,777 --> 01:18:15,196
Start another day

1089
01:18:17,156 --> 01:18:21,952
She won't let you leave
and she does her best

1090
01:18:22,036 --> 01:18:24,580
Try to make you stay

1091
01:18:27,041 --> 01:18:31,295
Pretty baby
gonna start to cry

1092
01:18:31,379 --> 01:18:35,341
She don't ever wanna
say goodbye

1093
01:18:35,424 --> 01:18:41,097
She's in love
She want to be Daddy's girl

1094
01:18:44,141 --> 01:18:48,896
She don't ever wanna be
without you

1095
01:18:48,980 --> 01:18:53,275
Never have to worry
She won't doubt you

1096
01:18:53,359 --> 01:18:57,530
Then she puts her head
upon your shoulder

1097
01:18:57,613 --> 01:19:02,118
- Says she'll marry you
when she gets older
- Go again, please.

1098
01:19:03,244 --> 01:19:06,580
- I will see you burn in hell.
- You'll see me where?

1099
01:19:06,664 --> 01:19:09,750
- In hell. You heard me.
- Yes, and where will you be...

1100
01:19:09,834 --> 01:19:11,919
while I'm burning in hell?

1101
01:19:12,003 --> 01:19:15,423
I'll tell you where I'll be,
you silly bitch.

1102
01:19:15,506 --> 01:19:18,718
I will be in Niagara Falls,
that's where.

1103
01:19:20,928 --> 01:19:23,723
Can you say "Michael"?
Michael.

1104
01:19:23,806 --> 01:19:27,977
Huh? Yeah.
Can you say "Michael"?

1105
01:19:28,060 --> 01:19:31,355
Michael. Michael.

1106
01:19:31,439 --> 01:19:36,110
She won't understand
why you're feeling sad

1107
01:19:36,193 --> 01:19:41,407
'Cause she's leaving you alone

1108
01:19:41,490 --> 01:19:45,786
Little woman gonna make you cry

1109
01:19:45,870 --> 01:19:50,207
You don't ever
wanna say goodbye

1110
01:19:50,291 --> 01:19:56,255
She's a lady
She'll always be Daddy's girl

1111
01:19:59,050 --> 01:20:03,304
Little woman
gonna break your heart

1112
01:20:03,387 --> 01:20:05,431
- She's a lady
- One bottle, please. One bottle.

1113
01:20:05,514 --> 01:20:08,100
- She'll always be Daddy's girl
- Bottle.

1114
01:20:08,184 --> 01:20:13,314
- Bottle, please. Bottle. Here it comes.
- Always be Daddy's girl

1115
01:20:13,397 --> 01:20:16,901
She'll always be Daddy's girl

1116
01:20:30,331 --> 01:20:34,919
Shh. I know, I know, I know, I know.
I know, I know. Yes, yes, yes.

1117
01:20:42,051 --> 01:20:45,346
- What's the matter?
- I don't know. She just... She doesn't
seem to want to stop crying.

1118
01:20:45,429 --> 01:20:47,723
That's not like her.

1119
01:20:47,807 --> 01:20:50,351
- Well?
- Let's give it a try.

1120
01:20:50,434 --> 01:20:53,604
Really? All right. I'll, uh...

1121
01:20:56,399 --> 01:21:00,695
Goodnight, sweetheart
Well, it's time to go

1122
01:21:02,446 --> 01:21:07,159
Goodnight, sweetheart
Well, it's time to go

1123
01:21:08,577 --> 01:21:13,624
I hate to leave you
but I really must say

1124
01:21:13,708 --> 01:21:17,503
Goodnight, sweetheart
Goodnight

1125
01:21:18,629 --> 01:21:21,507
Well, it's 3:00

1126
01:21:21,590 --> 01:21:24,135
In the morning

1127
01:21:24,218 --> 01:21:28,639
Baby, I just can't treat you right

1128
01:21:28,723 --> 01:21:31,851
Well, I hate to leave you, baby

1129
01:21:31,934 --> 01:21:34,562
I don't mean maybe

1130
01:21:34,645 --> 01:21:37,690
Because I love you so

1131
01:21:40,609 --> 01:21:44,155
Goodnight, sweetheart
Well, it's time to go

1132
01:21:45,614 --> 01:21:50,494
Goodnight, sweetheart
Well, it's time to go

1133
01:21:50,578 --> 01:21:55,124
I hate to leave you
but I really must say

1134
01:21:55,207 --> 01:21:59,628
Goodnight, sweetheart
Goodnight

1135
01:22:09,805 --> 01:22:12,433
I didn't know you sang so well.

1136
01:22:12,516 --> 01:22:14,935
Well, you know, it, uh,
kind of helps her sleep.

1137
01:22:18,022 --> 01:22:21,984
This is having quite an effect on you.
You gonna have any more kids?

1138
01:22:22,068 --> 01:22:24,904
I don't want to talk about it,
Rebecca. Goodnight.

1139
01:22:32,953 --> 01:22:35,873
Peter, I'm having
a lot of trouble sleeping.

1140
01:22:35,956 --> 01:22:38,709
Could you sing to me, please?

1141
01:22:53,307 --> 01:22:56,227
All right, so, uh...

1142
01:22:56,310 --> 01:22:58,938
Thank you. Thank you.

1143
01:22:59,021 --> 01:23:01,440
Great.

1144
01:23:03,609 --> 01:23:06,237
- Good morning.
- Hello.

1145
01:23:12,243 --> 01:23:14,662
There you go.

1146
01:23:19,875 --> 01:23:22,753
Yes?

1147
01:23:22,837 --> 01:23:25,256
I'm Sylvia.

1148
01:23:26,590 --> 01:23:28,592
Mary's mother.
I've come to get her.

1149
01:23:33,514 --> 01:23:36,267
- Just a minute.
- How is she doing?

1150
01:23:39,061 --> 01:23:43,983
She's fýne. She's teething.
That can be rough.

1151
01:23:47,194 --> 01:23:51,032
- Can I see her?
- Yeah, sure. Come on in.

1152
01:24:05,921 --> 01:24:10,259
I don't believe
how wonderful she looks!

1153
01:24:10,343 --> 01:24:13,387
Oh! Hello, Mary.

1154
01:24:13,471 --> 01:24:15,723
Hello, my darling.

1155
01:24:15,806 --> 01:24:20,186
It's your mommy.
Yes, it's your mommy.

1156
01:24:20,269 --> 01:24:24,398
You're very beautiful.
Your hair is growing.

1157
01:24:24,482 --> 01:24:27,234
You've changed so much,
and I've missed it.

1158
01:24:27,318 --> 01:24:29,904
Mommy has missed you.

1159
01:24:29,987 --> 01:24:33,741
Oh, I never thought
I'd miss her this much.

1160
01:24:33,824 --> 01:24:36,410
Hello!

1161
01:24:36,494 --> 01:24:39,330
Hello!

1162
01:24:39,413 --> 01:24:42,500
Where's my baby?
Is Jack here?

1163
01:24:44,418 --> 01:24:48,798
- I'll get him.
- Mary, look how big you've gotten!

1164
01:24:52,969 --> 01:24:55,262
Michael. Michael.

1165
01:24:57,974 --> 01:25:00,601
Sylvia's here.

1166
01:25:00,685 --> 01:25:03,104
Mary's leaving.

1167
01:25:26,127 --> 01:25:28,754
She looks very happy, Jack.

1168
01:25:28,838 --> 01:25:32,091
You've obviously taken
good care of her.

1169
01:25:34,176 --> 01:25:36,804
I'm sorry.

1170
01:25:36,887 --> 01:25:40,850
I shouldn't have left her
the way I did.

1171
01:25:40,933 --> 01:25:43,477
I hope it didn't cause
too much trouble.

1172
01:25:45,313 --> 01:25:48,065
Uh, no, no. No trouble at all.

1173
01:25:51,569 --> 01:25:54,447
Sylvia.

1174
01:25:54,530 --> 01:25:57,158
There's something I need to know.

1175
01:25:57,241 --> 01:25:59,660
Is she really mine?

1176
01:26:01,579 --> 01:26:03,998
Yes. She is.

1177
01:26:10,463 --> 01:26:14,842
So, uh, what are you gonna do now?
Do you... Do you have any idea?

1178
01:26:14,925 --> 01:26:17,470
I, um...

1179
01:26:17,553 --> 01:26:19,555
I'm going home.

1180
01:26:19,639 --> 01:26:22,558
I can't work and take care
of Mary on my own...

1181
01:26:22,642 --> 01:26:25,478
so, um...

1182
01:26:25,561 --> 01:26:28,397
we're going to move in
with my family.

1183
01:26:28,481 --> 01:26:30,900
They said they'd help.

1184
01:26:32,777 --> 01:26:35,196
You're going to London?

1185
01:26:37,615 --> 01:26:40,034
Yeah.

1186
01:26:50,586 --> 01:26:53,214
When?

1187
01:26:53,297 --> 01:26:55,716
Tonight.

1188
01:26:58,427 --> 01:27:02,056
- Is that what you really want to do?
- Sorry?

1189
01:27:02,139 --> 01:27:04,558
Never mind.

1190
01:27:08,312 --> 01:27:12,233
- You pack all the bottles?
- Yeah.

1191
01:27:12,316 --> 01:27:14,902
And cans of formula?

1192
01:27:14,986 --> 01:27:17,530
- You packed 'em.
- Yeah.

1193
01:27:19,782 --> 01:27:23,744
What about the blender?
Maybe we should give her that,
to mash up bananas and stuff.

1194
01:27:23,828 --> 01:27:26,497
Sure.

1195
01:27:26,580 --> 01:27:30,251
And diapers?
You pack extra Pampers?

1196
01:27:30,334 --> 01:27:32,753
Yeah.

1197
01:27:34,380 --> 01:27:38,259
How can he let her go?
If I were Jack, I would not let her go.

1198
01:27:38,342 --> 01:27:41,929
Neither would I, Michael.
Neither would I.

1199
01:27:42,013 --> 01:27:45,558
But he's the father.

1200
01:27:45,641 --> 01:27:47,977
I don't think he wants her to go...

1201
01:27:48,060 --> 01:27:50,479
but he just can't admit it.

1202
01:27:55,234 --> 01:27:58,404
You know, if you want anything,
anything at all, you call us, okay?

1203
01:27:58,487 --> 01:28:02,450
She'll probably be hungry in an hour.
She's a real good eater, so, uh...

1204
01:28:02,533 --> 01:28:05,578
- Like her daddy.
- Some of this stuff's fragile in here.

1205
01:28:05,661 --> 01:28:08,539
- Okay, I got it.
- You know, if she... if she wakes up
in the middle of the night...

1206
01:28:08,622 --> 01:28:10,624
she likes to be sung to.

1207
01:28:10,708 --> 01:28:12,877
'50s and '60s music works best.

1208
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:16,881
- Thanks. I'll remember that.
- You're all set. Everything's packed.

1209
01:28:16,964 --> 01:28:19,759
If there's anything else you need,
Just, uh, call us.

1210
01:28:19,842 --> 01:28:23,971
- Anything. Okay?
- Thank you.

1211
01:28:24,055 --> 01:28:26,557
Well, maybe, uh...

1212
01:28:26,641 --> 01:28:29,060
Here, let me, uh... Go ahead.

1213
01:28:35,232 --> 01:28:38,235
- Gloucester Hotel, please.
- The Gloucester, okay.

1214
01:28:38,319 --> 01:28:41,989
I'll write and let you know
how we're doing.

1215
01:28:43,115 --> 01:28:45,743
Come on, darling.

1216
01:28:45,826 --> 01:28:48,412
Wave goodbye, sweetheart.

1217
01:28:48,496 --> 01:28:51,248
- Bye, Mary.
- Bye, Mary.

1218
01:29:03,886 --> 01:29:08,975
Goodnight, sweetheart
Well, it's time to go

1219
01:29:10,977 --> 01:29:15,982
Goodnight, sweetheart
Well, it's time to go

1220
01:29:17,650 --> 01:29:22,863
I hate to leave you
but I really must say

1221
01:29:22,947 --> 01:29:28,828
Oh, goodnight, sweetheart
Goodnight

1222
01:29:30,621 --> 01:29:35,459
Goodnight, sweetheart
Well, it's time to go

1223
01:29:37,128 --> 01:29:42,049
Goodnight, sweetheart
Well, it's time to go

1224
01:29:43,759 --> 01:29:48,639
I hate to leave you
I really must say

1225
01:29:48,723 --> 01:29:54,770
Oh, goodnight, sweetheart
Goodnight

1226
01:29:54,854 --> 01:29:58,441
Well, it's 3:00

1227
01:29:58,524 --> 01:30:00,943
In the morning

1228
01:30:02,653 --> 01:30:07,700
Baby, I just can't do right

1229
01:30:07,783 --> 01:30:12,079
Well, I hate to leave you, baby

1230
01:30:12,163 --> 01:30:15,082
I don't mean maybe

1231
01:30:15,166 --> 01:30:19,003
Because I love you so

1232
01:30:21,964 --> 01:30:26,886
Goodnight, sweetheart
Well, it's time to go

1233
01:30:28,429 --> 01:30:33,643
Goodnight, sweetheart
Well, it's time to go

1234
01:30:35,144 --> 01:30:39,982
I hate to leave you
I really must say

1235
01:30:40,066 --> 01:30:45,112
Oh, goodnight, sweetheart
Goodnight

1236
01:30:47,531 --> 01:30:52,411
I hate to leave you
I really must say

1237
01:30:52,495 --> 01:30:56,999
Oh, goodnight, sweetheart
Goodnight

1238
01:31:10,554 --> 01:31:13,766
Guys like us shouldn't be
raising kids anyway.

1239
01:31:13,849 --> 01:31:15,518
Right?

1240
01:31:15,601 --> 01:31:18,020
Well, should we?

1241
01:31:18,104 --> 01:31:20,731
I suppose not.

1242
01:31:20,815 --> 01:31:22,817
She's better off with her mother.

1243
01:31:25,987 --> 01:31:30,825
And we are defýnitely better off
now that everything's back to normal.

1244
01:31:30,908 --> 01:31:33,244
- Right?
- Whatever you say, Jack.

1245
01:31:36,414 --> 01:31:38,833
Right.

1246
01:31:43,087 --> 01:31:46,007
So how come I feel so bad?

1247
01:31:46,090 --> 01:31:48,634
What'd you say?

1248
01:31:48,718 --> 01:31:53,139
How come I feel so bad?
I have this ache right here.

1249
01:31:53,222 --> 01:31:56,267
I don't know.
What do you think, Mike?

1250
01:31:56,350 --> 01:31:58,644
- It could be the wine.
- It's not the wine.

1251
01:31:58,728 --> 01:32:01,314
Well, what is it then?

1252
01:32:01,397 --> 01:32:04,442
I don't know.
I wish it would go away.

1253
01:32:04,525 --> 01:32:06,527
Maybe it's something you ate.

1254
01:32:08,070 --> 01:32:12,700
- Maybe you're not getting enough sleep.
- It's not that.

1255
01:32:12,783 --> 01:32:15,119
Then what the hell is it?

1256
01:32:16,620 --> 01:32:19,707
I miss Mary.

1257
01:32:21,876 --> 01:32:24,587
Okay?

1258
01:32:24,670 --> 01:32:27,089
I miss Mary.

1259
01:32:28,507 --> 01:32:31,052
I just wish there was
something I could do.

1260
01:32:33,095 --> 01:32:35,931
Well, maybe there is.

1261
01:32:37,308 --> 01:32:40,144
- What?
- When's her flight leaving?

1262
01:32:45,024 --> 01:32:47,360
- Yo, taxi!
- Taxi!

1263
01:32:47,443 --> 01:32:49,862
- Taxi!
- Taxi!

1264
01:32:51,697 --> 01:32:53,699
- Kennedy Airport.
- Yeah, Kennedy.

1265
01:32:53,783 --> 01:32:56,202
Kennedy Airport.

1266
01:33:00,373 --> 01:33:03,084
- Who you guys chasing?
- My baby girl.

1267
01:33:03,167 --> 01:33:06,504
- Her mother's taking her to London.
- Oh, yeah? How old?

1268
01:33:06,587 --> 01:33:09,465
- Se-Seven months.
- Seven months.
- Seven months? That's hard work.

1269
01:33:09,548 --> 01:33:11,550
But pretty soon,
they start to walk.

1270
01:33:11,634 --> 01:33:13,636
And let me tell you, the fýrst time you
hear the word "Daddy"...

1271
01:33:13,719 --> 01:33:16,847
I don't care who you are,
your heart just melts.

1272
01:33:16,931 --> 01:33:19,100
- Can you drive a little faster, please?
- Yeah.

1273
01:33:35,074 --> 01:33:38,536
- Thank you.
- Good luck to you.

1274
01:33:38,619 --> 01:33:41,497
Thanks. Good luck, guys.

1275
01:34:00,558 --> 01:34:04,061
Four. Gate four.

1276
01:34:06,022 --> 01:34:08,357
Excuse me, sir.
Hold it, fellas. One at a time.

1277
01:34:08,441 --> 01:34:11,068
Please, one at a time.
Any metal.

1278
01:34:11,152 --> 01:34:13,654
Put it in here, please.

1279
01:34:15,239 --> 01:34:18,367
Thank you, sir.
One at a time. Thank you.

1280
01:34:25,333 --> 01:34:28,836
One, two, three, four. Four!

1281
01:34:32,632 --> 01:34:36,010
- 176. Flight 176?
- That's it.

1282
01:35:29,563 --> 01:35:31,983
Thank you. Goodnight.

1283
01:36:04,807 --> 01:36:07,852
Sylvia, are you all right?
What happened?

1284
01:36:07,935 --> 01:36:11,564
- We thought you'd gone.
- I couldn't go, Jack. I couldn't do it.

1285
01:36:11,647 --> 01:36:13,983
I mean, I don't want to
make another mistake.

1286
01:36:14,066 --> 01:36:17,945
And I knew if I took her away,
I'd just be making another mistake.

1287
01:36:18,029 --> 01:36:19,613
I mean, l-I have to work.

1288
01:36:19,697 --> 01:36:23,200
I mean, I can't do that
and take care of Mary alone.

1289
01:36:23,284 --> 01:36:25,286
I mean, do you know what it's like?

1290
01:36:25,369 --> 01:36:28,247
A one-room flat,
on your feet all day...

1291
01:36:28,331 --> 01:36:30,750
working or auditioning.

1292
01:36:30,833 --> 01:36:32,877
And I'm on the job sometimes
until 3:00 in the morning.

1293
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:35,796
- And since Mary gets up at 5:30...
- Oh, I know, I know. It's awful.

1294
01:36:35,880 --> 01:36:38,341
- I mean, you can imagine
how much sleep I get.
- Yeah.

1295
01:36:38,424 --> 01:36:40,968
A-And after the 5:30 bottle,
it starts all over again at 9:00.

1296
01:36:41,052 --> 01:36:43,304
And by the time I change her and play
with her a little, it's already 8:00.

1297
01:36:43,387 --> 01:36:45,389
Well, forget about sleeping after that.
It's impossible.

1298
01:36:45,473 --> 01:36:47,475
And then the babysitters
until 3:00 in the morning.

1299
01:36:47,558 --> 01:36:49,560
All my money
is sucked down the tubes.

1300
01:36:49,644 --> 01:36:52,146
And me so tired.
I can't take Mary to the park.

1301
01:36:52,229 --> 01:36:54,857
Oh, tell me about it. Gettin' time to
take her to the park? That's a bitch.

1302
01:36:54,940 --> 01:36:58,736
- Sit down.
- I mean, I love my job, but...

1303
01:36:58,819 --> 01:37:01,530
I sometimes feel like I'm
Just working to pay the sitters...

1304
01:37:01,614 --> 01:37:03,949
and I run around all day...

1305
01:37:04,033 --> 01:37:06,243
and l-I don't get enough sleep.

1306
01:37:07,870 --> 01:37:10,498
And what's worse, I don't think
I'm taking very good care of Mary.

1307
01:37:10,581 --> 01:37:13,501
- No, of course you are.
- I am? I mean, I couldn't cope.

1308
01:37:13,584 --> 01:37:17,713
- Sylvia, we know how hard it is.
- Yeah, there's three of us.
We could hardly manage.

1309
01:37:17,797 --> 01:37:22,385
And I don't want to go to London.
I want to work in New York.

1310
01:37:22,468 --> 01:37:25,096
But I can't do that alone.

1311
01:37:25,179 --> 01:37:28,724
I hope I don't have to.

1312
01:37:28,808 --> 01:37:32,061
I need help.
I need someone to help me.

1313
01:37:32,144 --> 01:37:34,063
We'll help. We will help.

1314
01:37:34,146 --> 01:37:36,774
- Yes, yes, absolutely. I mean,
you can leave her anytime you want.
- Yes. Yes.

1315
01:37:36,857 --> 01:37:38,859
- We'd love to have her.
- Oh, gosh, yeah.

1316
01:37:38,943 --> 01:37:41,988
When you go for an audition or...
or you go shopping, or... or whatever.

1317
01:37:42,071 --> 01:37:44,615
- You want to be by yourself.
- I was hoping you would say that.

1318
01:37:44,699 --> 01:37:46,492
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Really? Oh...

1319
01:37:46,575 --> 01:37:48,619
- Thank you so much. Mary.
- Yeah, of course.

1320
01:37:48,703 --> 01:37:52,456
Hold it, guys. I don't think
I like this arrangement.

1321
01:37:52,540 --> 01:37:55,960
I just don't want to be
Mary's babysitter.

1322
01:37:56,043 --> 01:38:00,881
I want... We want to be able
to see her all the time. May I?

1323
01:38:00,965 --> 01:38:03,217
L-I agree. So what are you saying?
What do you... What do you mean?

1324
01:38:03,301 --> 01:38:05,511
I'm saying...

1325
01:38:05,594 --> 01:38:09,557
that I think Mary should
move in with us permanently...

1326
01:38:09,640 --> 01:38:11,851
that we should be her family.

1327
01:38:11,934 --> 01:38:14,687
Well, l-I think it's lovely
of you to offer, Peter...

1328
01:38:14,770 --> 01:38:16,772
but l-I couldn't let Mary...

1329
01:38:16,856 --> 01:38:19,066
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
- Oh, no, you don't understand.

1330
01:38:19,150 --> 01:38:22,778
You're right, Sylvia. She's... She's your
daughter. She needs a full-time mother.

1331
01:38:22,862 --> 01:38:27,366
- That's why we think that...
that... that you should move in too.
- We... We...

1332
01:38:27,450 --> 01:38:29,410
- Oh, it's a great idea. Oh, Sylvia.
- Yeah!
- L...

1333
01:38:29,493 --> 01:38:31,495
- What do you think? Come on.
- Of course, it's better than...
Four is better than three.

1334
01:38:31,579 --> 01:38:34,248
Uh... Do you... Do you have room?

1335
01:38:34,332 --> 01:38:36,876
I'll build you a room.
I'll build Mary a room.

1336
01:38:36,959 --> 01:38:38,919
- That's what he does in life.
- Yeah, that's what he does.
He builds rooms.

1337
01:38:39,003 --> 01:38:41,756
- Oh, please, say yes.
- Yes!

1338
01:38:41,839 --> 01:38:44,759
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1339
01:38:53,726 --> 01:38:56,979
Something happened, baby
in my life

1340
01:38:57,063 --> 01:38:59,065
The minute I saw you

1341
01:38:59,148 --> 01:39:01,233
The minute I saw you

1342
01:39:01,317 --> 01:39:04,362
All the others faded from my life

1343
01:39:04,445 --> 01:39:07,615
The minute I saw you

1344
01:39:07,698 --> 01:39:11,702
Hey, nothing mattered, baby
in my life

1345
01:39:11,786 --> 01:39:13,954
Till the minute I saw you

1346
01:39:14,038 --> 01:39:16,248
The minute I saw you

1347
01:39:16,332 --> 01:39:19,293
All the others faded from my life

1348
01:39:19,377 --> 01:39:21,796
The minute I saw you

1349
01:39:39,188 --> 01:39:42,191
I'm happy when I'm near to you

1350
01:39:42,274 --> 01:39:46,070
Yeah, it's true
Can't get any better

1351
01:39:46,153 --> 01:39:49,532
If someone else
would ever turn from me

1352
01:39:49,615 --> 01:39:53,703
You would see
that I wouldn't let her

1353
01:39:53,786 --> 01:39:57,456
Trust me, baby
You're the only one

1354
01:39:57,540 --> 01:40:01,210
Trust me
Don't let me be the lonely one

1355
01:40:01,294 --> 01:40:04,422
Something happened, baby
in my life

1356
01:40:04,505 --> 01:40:06,632
The minute I saw you

1357
01:40:06,716 --> 01:40:08,801
The minute I saw you

1358
01:40:08,884 --> 01:40:11,929
All the others faded from my life

1359
01:40:12,013 --> 01:40:14,432
The minute I saw you

1360
01:40:15,891 --> 01:40:19,353
Hold me, hold me

1361
01:40:19,437 --> 01:40:23,316
All I want to do
is kiss your baby face

1362
01:40:23,399 --> 01:40:26,861
Hold me, hold me

1363
01:40:26,944 --> 01:40:31,115
I wanna rock you in my arms
till I know you're safe

1364
01:40:33,534 --> 01:40:35,953
Till I know you're safe

1365
01:40:39,206 --> 01:40:42,293
Been waitin'all my life for you

1366
01:40:42,376 --> 01:40:46,255
Yeah, it's true
You better believe it

1367
01:40:46,339 --> 01:40:49,592
There ain't nothin'
I would hide from you

1368
01:40:49,675 --> 01:40:53,888
Trust my heart
You're all that I needed

1369
01:40:53,971 --> 01:40:57,600
Trust me
Baby, you're the only one

1370
01:40:57,683 --> 01:41:01,437
Trust me
Don't let me be the lonely one

1371
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:04,398
Something happened, baby

The minute I saw you

1376
01:41:15,409 --> 01:41:17,828
Hey

Something happened, baby
in my life

1378
01:41:39,850 --> 01:41:41,936

01:41:42,019 --> 01:41:44,230
The minute I saw you

1380
01:41:44,313 --> 01:41:47,316
All the others faded from my life

1381
01:41:47,400 --> 01:41:50,361
The minute I saw you

1382
01:41:50,444 --> 01:41:54,657
Yeah, something happened, baby
in my life

1383
01:41:54,740 --> 01:41:56,951

01:42:07,878 --> 01:42:11,340
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, yeah, yeah

1389
01:42:12,675 --> 01:42:15,177

1390
01:42:15,261 --> 01:42:17,972
Hey, hey

1391
01:42:18,055 --> 01:42:22,601
Just don't want to
leave her alone
