<i>ABBIE: He described
the appearance of the man</i>

2
00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:04,173
<i>that I saw in perfect detail.
He described</i>

3
00:00:04,207 --> 00:00:05,140
a man with no head.

4
00:00:05,175 --> 00:00:06,141
You think we're both crazy?

5
00:00:06,176 --> 00:00:07,242
Possibly.

6
00:00:07,277 --> 00:00:08,443
What about Brooks?
What about him?

7
00:00:08,478 --> 00:00:11,180
<i>BROOKS: I told you to
stay away from him.</i>

8
00:00:11,214 --> 00:00:12,347
I tried,

9
00:00:12,382 --> 00:00:13,348
<i>but you didn't listen.</i>

10
00:00:13,383 --> 00:00:15,517
<i>ABBIE:
That is not what happened.</i>

11
00:00:15,552 --> 00:00:17,352
Morales, right?
Yes, sir.

12
00:00:17,387 --> 00:00:18,987
You used to date
Lieutenant Mills?

13
00:00:19,889 --> 00:00:20,956
Abbie.

14
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:22,157
<i>ABBIE:
I think I found something.</i>

15
00:00:22,192 --> 00:00:23,492
<i>JENNY:
The square and compass.</i>

16
00:00:23,526 --> 00:00:24,660
You're a Mason?

17
00:00:24,694 --> 00:00:26,962
These... these men
are my brothers.

18
00:00:26,996 --> 00:00:29,331
<i>My life is tied to the
Horseman's, and his to mine.</i>

19
00:00:29,365 --> 00:00:31,667
If I die... he dies.

20
00:00:31,701 --> 00:00:33,635
I know a man who can help.

21
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,805
<i>Someone who can separate you
from the Horseman.</i>

22
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,874
(softly):
I feel him no more.

Paul!

36
00:02:11,401 --> 00:02:13,068
(distorted, echoing):
They're here!

37
00:02:22,245 --> 00:02:24,379
My God.

38
00:02:25,815 --> 00:02:29,284
Where did you procure such
massive quantities of reserves?

39
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:30,719
Is there a nearby citadel?

40
00:02:30,753 --> 00:02:33,322
A supermarket... (groans)
called Buy Plus.

41
00:02:33,356 --> 00:02:35,590
Buy in bulk, spend less.

42
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:37,125
I will take you there someday.

43
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,727
Do you know what we
could have done

44
00:02:38,761 --> 00:02:39,928
with these supplies
during the war?

45
00:02:39,963 --> 00:02:41,997
We'd have taken Lexington
in a day.

46
00:02:42,031 --> 00:02:43,665
Right now we have to make sure

47
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,500
that if the Horseman
attacks Sleepy Hollow,

48
00:02:45,535 --> 00:02:48,103
you could hunker down here.
Now that your blood tie

49
00:02:48,137 --> 00:02:50,572
with him his severed,
you're vulnerable.

50
00:02:54,677 --> 00:02:56,645
"Pine Springs."

51
00:02:56,679 --> 00:02:58,747
Is that a variation

52
00:02:58,781 --> 00:03:00,749
of water?

53
00:03:00,783 --> 00:03:02,985
A brand.
Cheapest one.

54
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:04,419
You paid?

55
00:03:04,454 --> 00:03:05,854
For water?

56
00:03:06,723 --> 00:03:08,156
(laughs)

57
00:03:08,191 --> 00:03:11,159
Why not drink from one of the
thousands of taps around town?

58
00:03:11,194 --> 00:03:12,961
Or the lake?

59
00:03:12,996 --> 00:03:15,297
Well, tap water's
got chemicals in it.

60
00:03:15,331 --> 00:03:17,499
And the lake,

61
00:03:17,533 --> 00:03:18,934
you don't even want to know.

62
00:03:18,968 --> 00:03:20,602
The extent of which
your generation

63
00:03:20,636 --> 00:03:22,804
has defiled this earth
is truly mind-boggling.

64
00:03:22,839 --> 00:03:24,840
(ringtone playing)

65
00:03:30,513 --> 00:03:33,682
The Horseman
will ride after dark.

66
00:03:33,716 --> 00:03:35,984
After we finish the kits,

67
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:37,786
why don't you meet
with the Masons

68
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,121
while I grab Corbin's shotgun

69
00:03:39,155 --> 00:03:40,522
from the precinct.
Rutledge says

70
00:03:40,556 --> 00:03:41,890
they've discovered information

71
00:03:41,924 --> 00:03:44,693
of how best to exploit
the Horseman's weaknesses.

72
00:03:44,727 --> 00:03:47,362
Are you certain you can forgo
such a conversation?

73
00:03:47,397 --> 00:03:48,830
They won't let me.

74
00:03:48,865 --> 00:03:51,666
The "no girls allowed" rule
really gets under my skin.

75
00:04:02,745 --> 00:04:03,912
Mills!

76
00:04:03,946 --> 00:04:06,081
Where were you today?
I'm on the late shift.

77
00:04:06,115 --> 00:04:08,417
I'm kind of in the middle
of something right now.

78
00:04:08,451 --> 00:04:09,985
What?
Prepping.

79
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:11,386
Prepping what?

80
00:04:11,421 --> 00:04:12,982
For my sister, Jenny--
she's getting out

81
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:14,756
of the institution tomorrow,
moving in with me.

82
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:16,558
Wow, that's a big change.

83
00:04:16,592 --> 00:04:19,061
Abs. Hey, two minutes.

84
00:04:19,095 --> 00:04:21,196
Come on, I just wanted
to talk to you

85
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,031
without having the Brit
hovering over my shoulder.

86
00:04:23,066 --> 00:04:24,332
Look, Abbie, I know things

87
00:04:24,367 --> 00:04:26,201
have been weird between us
since we broke up.

88
00:04:26,235 --> 00:04:28,003
I really do not
have time for this.

89
00:04:28,037 --> 00:04:30,772
But I see you every day.
I don't know if it's Corbin

90
00:04:30,807 --> 00:04:34,242
or Jenny or all of it,
but I care about you, Abbie.

91
00:04:34,277 --> 00:04:36,044
Abbie...
Luke.

92
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:38,280
<i>I am here.</i>

93
00:04:38,314 --> 00:04:42,284
LUKE: Before we dated, we
used to be friends, remember?

94
00:04:42,318 --> 00:04:43,919
Can we at least
get back to that?

95
00:04:43,953 --> 00:04:45,620
How about coffee?

96
00:04:48,257 --> 00:04:50,892
Tomorrow afternoon.
Oh, slow down. I didn't think

97
00:04:50,927 --> 00:04:53,528
<i>we were gonna be
moving this fast.</i>

98
00:04:53,563 --> 00:04:56,231
Temper expectations, please.

99
00:05:08,244 --> 00:05:09,911
MAN:
Morales.

100
00:05:15,618 --> 00:05:17,719

Brooks.

103
00:05:32,301 --> 00:05:34,536
I-I... thought
you were dead.

104
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:36,238
Ah.

105
00:05:36,272 --> 00:05:39,174
Rumors of my demise
have been...

106
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,309
pretty much true.

107
00:05:41,344 --> 00:05:42,978
What are you?

108
00:05:43,012 --> 00:05:44,346
I saw you

109
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,680
with Abbie Mills.

110
00:05:45,715 --> 00:05:47,082
Stay away from her.

111
00:05:47,116 --> 00:05:48,984
What?
Stay away from Abbie Mills.

112
00:05:49,018 --> 00:05:50,652
I'm the only one that
can protect her.

113
00:05:50,686 --> 00:05:53,088
You're protecting her?
From what?

114
00:05:53,122 --> 00:05:55,423
The end. I can protect
her from the end.

115
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:57,259
Everyone will die...

116
00:05:57,293 --> 00:06:01,329
except for the chosen few.

117
00:06:01,364 --> 00:06:03,832
(distorted): There's a war going
on, Morales, a war you won't see

118
00:06:03,866 --> 00:06:05,867
or hear until

119
00:06:05,902 --> 00:06:08,336
it's upon you,
and by then it will be too late.

120
00:06:08,371 --> 00:06:10,372
There are others like me
in Sleepy Hollow,

121
00:06:10,406 --> 00:06:12,140

122

(panting)

124
00:06:18,347 --> 00:06:20,448
The time's coming soon

125
00:06:20,483 --> 00:06:22,584
for you to pick a side.

126
00:06:22,618 --> 00:06:25,453

Right there.

00:09:19,929 --> 00:09:22,297
Okay, that's enough for now.

155
00:09:22,332 --> 00:09:23,581
This goes without saying,

156
00:09:23,701 --> 00:09:25,092
but in your description
of events,

157
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,290
let's make sure
the perp isn't headless.

158
00:09:27,324 --> 00:09:29,525
Crane, you said
you knew these men.

159
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,562
Who are they?
A local chapter of the Freemasons.

160
00:09:32,596 --> 00:09:35,898
A centuries-old organization
of craftsmen with knowledge...

161
00:09:35,933 --> 00:09:37,367
I know who the Freemasons are.

162
00:09:37,401 --> 00:09:39,969
Why did they get
their heads chopped off?

163
00:09:40,003 --> 00:09:41,371
For 500 years...

164
00:09:41,405 --> 00:09:44,040
the Masons have been involved
in a secret war

165
00:09:44,074 --> 00:09:45,842
between good and evil.

166
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:48,878
They're brave soldiers.

167
00:09:48,912 --> 00:09:51,080
These were good men.

168
00:09:51,115 --> 00:09:52,348
Where are all the heads?

169
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,851
He took them, sir.
I am running out of rope

170
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:57,120
with which to hang myself.

171
00:09:57,154 --> 00:10:00,390
For now, our working theory
is cult ritual suicide,

172
00:10:00,424 --> 00:10:02,525
understand?

173
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:03,659
I'm helping you.

174
00:10:03,694 --> 00:10:05,361
I'm trying to give you
what you need

175
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:08,364
to take this bastard down,
but this just keeps getting

176
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,167
bigger and bigger,
and I still do not have proof

177
00:10:11,201 --> 00:10:12,869
that the Horseman really exists.

178
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:14,904
ABBIE:
Four beheaded Masons

179
00:10:14,938 --> 00:10:16,372
isn't proof?
Of four Masons

180
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:17,774
without a head, yes,

181
00:10:17,808 --> 00:10:20,443
Of a headless horseman, no.

182
00:10:22,546 --> 00:10:24,414
I have to notify the families.

183
00:10:24,448 --> 00:10:26,916
We'll talk about this
back at the precinct.

184
00:10:33,657 --> 00:10:36,025
Crane?

185
00:10:44,902 --> 00:10:46,602
Find anything?
Not yet. The Masons said they had

186
00:10:46,637 --> 00:10:49,238
information on the Horseman,
so it must be here somewhere.

187
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:51,507
Crane, I'm sorry.

188
00:10:51,542 --> 00:10:52,909
It's war.

189
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:55,077
It's not the first time
I've lost friends in battle

190
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:57,146
and it certainly
won't be the last.

191
00:10:58,148 --> 00:11:00,216
It must be here.

192
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:04,454
Horseman of Death...

193
00:11:13,096 --> 00:11:14,931
(shouts)

194
00:11:19,603 --> 00:11:21,804
You okay?
In 1781,

195
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,341
when the Horseman slashed open
my chest,

196
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:27,176
I knew I was a dead man.

197
00:11:30,848 --> 00:11:35,585
But before I collapsed,
I had one last thought...

198
00:11:36,687 --> 00:11:39,155
...if I die,
he's coming with me.

199
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:42,625
That dying wish became prophecy

200
00:11:42,659 --> 00:11:44,994
when our bloodlines merged
on the battlefield,

201
00:11:45,028 --> 00:11:47,029
<i>entwining our mortality</i>

202
00:11:47,064 --> 00:11:49,866
and our fate.

203
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,635
Until the Sin Eater
severed your blood tie.

204
00:11:52,669 --> 00:11:57,006
What if the Horseman came here
tonight looking for you?

205
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,141
Then I pray next time
he finds me.

206
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:01,410
He may kill my Mason brothers.
He may even kill me.

207
00:12:01,445 --> 00:12:03,679
But I will not go alone.

208
00:12:03,714 --> 00:12:06,282
I will not leave this earth
with him still on it.

209
00:12:06,316 --> 00:12:07,950
He beheaded my mentor.
I want him killed

210
00:12:07,985 --> 00:12:09,886
just as badly as you do.

211
00:12:14,892 --> 00:12:16,893
(exhales)

212
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:28,304
I know why the Horseman
came here tonight.

213
00:12:28,338 --> 00:12:30,206
He was looking for his skull.

214
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,908
Why would he think it was here?

215
00:12:31,942 --> 00:12:35,511
The Masons are the
traditional guardians of secrets

216
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:38,247
and artifacts
for the side of good.

217
00:12:38,282 --> 00:12:40,416
The Horseman would've assumed

218
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:42,084
that his skull was
in their possession.

219
00:12:42,119 --> 00:12:44,420
When the Horseman came
last time,

220
00:12:44,454 --> 00:12:48,524
Katrina warned us that if he got
his skull, the other three

221
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,526
Horsemen of the
Apocalypse would rise.

222
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:53,329
The Horseman is here to hasten
the end of days,

223
00:12:53,363 --> 00:12:55,431
just as he tried before.

224
00:12:55,465 --> 00:12:57,433
We must retrieve his head
before he does.

225
00:12:57,467 --> 00:12:59,302
And this time...

226
00:12:59,336 --> 00:13:01,103
we destroy it.

227
00:13:08,645 --> 00:13:11,047
(knocking) You're asking my permission
to destroy evidence?

228
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:13,883
Agent Collins from the FBI.

229
00:13:13,917 --> 00:13:16,185
Call back. I have a few more.
Marlene Ramsay?

230
00:13:16,219 --> 00:13:18,788
The victim's wife. I'll call her
as soon as I'm done.

231
00:13:18,822 --> 00:13:21,357
And your daughter wanted to remind you
it's Cynthia's birthday tomorrow.

232
00:13:21,391 --> 00:13:22,792
She kept the damn dog.
Do I really need to call her

233
00:13:22,826 --> 00:13:23,859
on her birthday?

234
00:13:23,894 --> 00:13:25,227
Mother of your child.

235
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:26,262
Like I could forget.

236
00:13:26,296 --> 00:13:27,897
(chuckles)

237
00:13:29,232 --> 00:13:31,067
(door shuts)

238
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:34,270
I just told you I needed
more proof and you respond

239
00:13:34,304 --> 00:13:36,272
by asking me to destroy evidence?
Sir,

240
00:13:36,306 --> 00:13:37,773
I'll take care of it.

241
00:13:37,808 --> 00:13:39,241
It'll never come back to you.

242
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:41,243
I don't have it.

243
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:44,046
I sent the skull out
to another lab.

244
00:13:44,081 --> 00:13:45,715
CRANE:
Marlene Ramsay,

245
00:13:45,749 --> 00:13:47,984
have you informed her
of her husband's passing?

246
00:13:48,018 --> 00:13:49,986
Yes.

247
00:13:52,656 --> 00:13:55,458
During the war,
I personally informed the family

248
00:13:55,492 --> 00:13:57,727
when a soldier
in my regiment was killed.

249
00:13:57,761 --> 00:13:59,996
There is no worse feeling
than telling someone

250
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:01,731
their loved one's gone.

251
00:14:01,765 --> 00:14:04,133
Especially
when it's under your watch.

252
00:14:06,169 --> 00:14:07,970
The Horseman will kill
every night

253
00:14:08,005 --> 00:14:09,505
until he gets what he came for.

254
00:14:09,539 --> 00:14:13,142
And you'll have to make
that call over and over again.

255
00:14:16,346 --> 00:14:18,581
You've come this far, sir.

256
00:14:18,615 --> 00:14:20,616
You need to trust us.

257
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:22,284
(knocking, door opens)

258
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:24,086
The D.A.'s on line one.

259
00:14:25,122 --> 00:14:28,124
I'll call her from the car.

260
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:32,028
Stick around.
I won't be gone long.

261
00:14:37,134 --> 00:14:39,135
(muffled music playing)

262
00:14:40,637 --> 00:14:43,305
Paul?

263
00:14:56,753 --> 00:14:59,155
Hey.
Thanks for coming in so late.

264
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:02,291
No problem. Unfortunately,

265
00:15:02,325 --> 00:15:04,460
we still can't figure out
what kind of processes

266
00:15:04,494 --> 00:15:06,395
were done to the skull.

267
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:09,298
We put it through the woodwork.
(grunts)

268
00:15:09,332 --> 00:15:11,834
Biopsy came back unreadable,

269
00:15:11,868 --> 00:15:14,336
so we ran cytology:

270
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:16,372
nothing. PCR?

271
00:15:16,406 --> 00:15:18,040
Still nothing.

272
00:15:18,075 --> 00:15:19,308
I'm running carbon dating,

273
00:15:19,342 --> 00:15:20,743
but that takes
a few more weeks.

274
00:15:20,777 --> 00:15:21,844
There's so much more to test.

275
00:15:21,878 --> 00:15:24,046
No definable cell structure,

276
00:15:24,081 --> 00:15:25,848
no DNA markers--

277
00:15:25,882 --> 00:15:28,484
it's been scrubbed
of any sign of life.

278
00:15:28,518 --> 00:15:29,985
And yet, there it is.

279
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,520
Do you have a box?

280
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:41,230
(sputters)

281
00:15:49,975 --> 00:15:52,277
I know we got the right size box
in here somewhere.

282
00:15:52,397 --> 00:15:55,646
If you don't have a box,
I'll take a bag.

283
00:16:00,152 --> 00:16:02,620
(automatic gunfire)

284
00:16:11,029 --> 00:16:12,330
Oh, my God.

285
00:16:13,499 --> 00:16:16,367
(gunshots)

286
00:16:30,215 --> 00:16:31,315
(cocks shotgun)

287
00:16:32,284 --> 00:16:33,751
(cocks shotgun)

288
00:16:42,594 --> 00:16:45,530
(cocks shotgun)
I got you, you headless son of a bitch.

289
00:16:45,564 --> 00:16:47,498
(hissing)

290
00:16:53,872 --> 00:16:55,873
(thunder rumbles)

291
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,681
(starts engine)

292
00:17:09,755 --> 00:17:11,188
(tires screech)

293
00:17:13,425 --> 00:17:15,726
(horse neighs)
(tires screeching)

294
00:17:18,797 --> 00:17:20,731
(thunder rumbles)

295
00:17:22,901 --> 00:17:26,704
I wanted to call my guys
in Manhattan and hunt him down.

296
00:17:26,738 --> 00:17:30,608
But local PD says all the
surveillance cameras at the lab

297
00:17:30,642 --> 00:17:32,577
cut out. There's
no evidence

298
00:17:32,611 --> 00:17:33,644
of the Horseman.
It's like

299
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,246
at the precinct with Brooks.

300
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,447
They can't be seen
until they want

301
00:17:36,481 --> 00:17:38,482
to be seen.
It's all true?

302
00:17:38,517 --> 00:17:40,551
Everything you told me
from day one?

303
00:17:40,586 --> 00:17:43,387
This is insane.
He murdered Paul

304
00:17:43,422 --> 00:17:45,723
in front of me.

305
00:17:45,757 --> 00:17:47,925
I need to... fill out a report.

306
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,594
I need to call the governor.

307
00:17:49,628 --> 00:17:50,761
What are you going to tell him?

308
00:17:50,796 --> 00:17:51,762
What do you think
I'm gonna tell him?

309
00:17:51,797 --> 00:17:53,064
A headless horseman

310
00:17:53,098 --> 00:17:56,067
is mowing people down
to bring about the end of days?

311
00:17:56,101 --> 00:17:58,235
For further questions,
please call Ichabod Crane,

312
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,637
the man who beheaded him
in 1781.

313
00:17:59,671 --> 00:18:01,973
It was a mere inquiry.

314
00:18:02,007 --> 00:18:04,108
You wanted proof.

315
00:18:04,142 --> 00:18:07,645
Honestly...

316
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,947
I wanted it to be a lie.

317
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:15,152
Well, we got him.

318
00:18:15,187 --> 00:18:17,622
Now let's destroy it.

319
00:18:27,165 --> 00:18:29,634
How rare to stare

320
00:18:29,668 --> 00:18:31,636
into the face of Death.

321
00:18:33,505 --> 00:18:36,674
It's something I never intend
to do again.

322
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:45,349
(bubbling, sizzling)

323
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:09,040
(explosion)

324
00:19:14,546 --> 00:19:17,114
There's a junkyard in Tarrytown

325
00:19:17,149 --> 00:19:19,116
with an industrial
car compactor.

326
00:19:19,151 --> 00:19:21,919
I've seen it turn an SUV
into an ice cube.

327
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:24,121
If it can't crush the skull,
nothing can.

328
00:19:24,156 --> 00:19:26,657
The myriad of destructive
devices you have in this century

329
00:19:26,692 --> 00:19:28,693
is remarkable.

330
00:19:30,262 --> 00:19:32,930
It's late.

331
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:36,701
They weren't there earlier.

332
00:19:37,803 --> 00:19:38,769
Is that common?

333
00:19:38,804 --> 00:19:41,072
Four lanterns lit in a carport?

334
00:19:41,106 --> 00:19:42,139
Don't know.

335
00:19:42,174 --> 00:19:43,607
Probably not.

336
00:19:43,642 --> 00:19:46,343
Why?
In my day, Paul Revere developed a system:

337
00:19:46,378 --> 00:19:48,145
one lantern,
the enemy comes by land.

338
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,313
Two, they come by sea.

339
00:19:49,347 --> 00:19:51,148
Paul Revere, midnight ride.

340
00:19:51,183 --> 00:19:53,150
"One if by land, two if by sea."

341
00:19:53,185 --> 00:19:54,952
You've heard of it?

342
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:57,121
Word may have gotten around.

343
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:59,156
What does four lanterns mean?

344
00:20:22,047 --> 00:20:24,181
Why would the Horseman do this?

345
00:20:25,517 --> 00:20:29,820
The Masons believe their minds
are akin to a temple.

346
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:32,323
A sacred, holy place.

347
00:20:34,493 --> 00:20:38,496
We're tampering with his head
and he's responding in kind.

348
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:44,001
He lined the heads with silver.

349
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:48,939
Is it... along the top
of the skull?

350
00:20:52,644 --> 00:20:54,612
Does that mean something to you?

351
00:20:54,646 --> 00:20:57,615
Paul Revere utilized
the same technique

352
00:20:57,649 --> 00:21:00,317
the night the Crown arrived
in the colonies.

353
00:21:00,352 --> 00:21:04,188
<i>In 1775 Paul Revere lined
the lanterns with silver</i>

354
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:05,623
<i>to enhance their illumination.</i>

355
00:21:05,657 --> 00:21:08,125
<i>I was guarding the safe house</i>

356
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:12,429
<i>where Sam Adams and John
Hancock were evading arrest.</i>

357
00:21:12,464 --> 00:21:14,298
<i>When I alerted Adams
that the Crown was coming</i>

358
00:21:14,332 --> 00:21:18,035
<i>by sea, I observed him hand
Paul Revere a document,</i>

359
00:21:18,069 --> 00:21:21,472
<i>a continuous manuscript kept
by the Masons containing</i>

360
00:21:21,506 --> 00:21:23,707
<i>enemy secrets that could be
used to defeat the Crown.</i>

361
00:21:23,742 --> 00:21:24,909
<i>There was a symbol</i>

362
00:21:24,943 --> 00:21:28,913
on the manuscript,
a demonic heptagram.

363
00:21:28,947 --> 00:21:30,347
I've seen it in Corbin's files.

364
00:21:30,382 --> 00:21:34,685
It's a star within a star.

365
00:21:34,719 --> 00:21:37,054
<i>ABBIE: The Devil's trap--
I've seen it, too.</i>

366
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:40,357
<i>But it's a symbol used
to entrap and defeat demons.</i>

367
00:21:40,392 --> 00:21:41,559
Why would that be
on a manuscript

368
00:21:41,593 --> 00:21:43,260
containing enemy secrets?

369
00:21:43,295 --> 00:21:44,762
Maybe they weren't
secrets of the Crown.

370
00:21:44,796 --> 00:21:46,897
They were secrets
for conquering evil.

371
00:21:49,301 --> 00:21:51,302
My God.

372
00:21:53,004 --> 00:21:54,605
The Horseman of Death was there

373
00:21:54,639 --> 00:21:56,140
that night.

374
00:21:56,174 --> 00:21:57,875
Where?

375
00:21:57,909 --> 00:22:01,345
<i>CRANE: Paul Revere told us of an
enemy assailant who chased him</i>

376
00:22:01,379 --> 00:22:03,113
on his ride into Lexington.

377
00:22:03,148 --> 00:22:05,015
<i>He believed it was</i>

378
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:08,118
<i>a cold-blooded mercenary
for the Crown, but...</i>

379
00:22:09,788 --> 00:22:11,956
But it was Death himself.

380
00:22:15,493 --> 00:22:17,061
He was after the manuscript.

381
00:22:17,095 --> 00:22:19,196
It must contain
a secret about him,

382
00:22:19,231 --> 00:22:22,466
uh, his weakness or flaw.

383
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,302
Do you think that it was updated
after you cut off his head?

384
00:22:25,337 --> 00:22:26,537
I do.

385
00:22:29,241 --> 00:22:30,741
I'd wager that's the information

386
00:22:30,775 --> 00:22:32,679
the Masons wanted
to share with us.

387
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,685
We got to find that manuscript.

388
00:22:42,246 --> 00:22:46,149
Tarrytown Museum
of Colonial History.

389
00:22:46,183 --> 00:22:48,418
This venue holds
the manuscript?

390
00:22:48,452 --> 00:22:51,287
Amongst other
historical artifacts.

391
00:22:51,321 --> 00:22:52,889
This might be your happy place.

392
00:22:52,923 --> 00:22:54,123
GUIDE:
Paul Revere

393
00:22:54,158 --> 00:22:57,160
was a Renaissance man--
a silversmith,

394
00:22:57,194 --> 00:22:59,996
an early industrialist, and even

395
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:02,231
a highly acclaimed dentist.

396
00:23:02,266 --> 00:23:04,734
All right, kids, follow me.

397
00:23:04,768 --> 00:23:07,437
It's apocryphal, what this man
is telling these children.

398
00:23:07,471 --> 00:23:08,805
Let it go.

399
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:10,440
Uh...

400
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:22,118
Were you charged a fee
for that water?

401
00:23:22,152 --> 00:23:24,587
My God, it should be
an inalienable right.

402
00:23:24,621 --> 00:23:26,923
Where do the courts fall on this?
GUIDE: Gather round.

403
00:23:26,957 --> 00:23:28,925
Uh...Wait.
And make sure everybody can see.

404
00:23:28,959 --> 00:23:30,693
Now, while Revere was,

405
00:23:30,727 --> 00:23:32,995
well, revered

406
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:35,031
for his many talents,
he is most famous

407
00:23:35,065 --> 00:23:37,934
for what historical event?

408
00:23:37,968 --> 00:23:40,369
CHILDREN: The midnight ride.
That's right.

409
00:23:40,404 --> 00:23:44,340
In fact, many refer to it
as Paul Revere's midnight ride

410
00:23:44,374 --> 00:23:46,275
since he was
the first patriot to yell

411
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,944
"The British are coming!"
as he rode into Concord.

412
00:23:47,978 --> 00:23:49,111
Uh, pardon the interruption,

413
00:23:49,146 --> 00:23:50,847
but Paul Revere never arrived
in Concord.

414
00:23:50,881 --> 00:23:53,850
That was
Samuel Prescott's route,

415
00:23:53,884 --> 00:23:57,286
and the warning all the riders
gave, as discreetly as possible,

416
00:23:57,321 --> 00:24:01,924
was "The Regulars are coming,"
not "The British are coming."

417
00:24:01,959 --> 00:24:03,559
See, we, too,
were British at the time

418
00:24:03,594 --> 00:24:05,728
so that would have been
most unhelpful.

419
00:24:05,762 --> 00:24:06,963
Did you just say "we"?

420
00:24:06,997 --> 00:24:08,698
Excuse us.

421
00:24:08,732 --> 00:24:11,567
My cousin Steve forgot to take
his medication this morning.

422
00:24:11,602 --> 00:24:12,935
Didn't you, Steve?
I'm the only one amongst you

423
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:14,210
who doesn't require medication.

424
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,508
A highly acclaimed dentist.

425
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:20,543
The man was a silversmith.

426
00:24:20,577 --> 00:24:22,845
That's the last person you want
poking around in your mouth.

427
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,081
So I spoke to one
of the curators.

428
00:24:25,115 --> 00:24:26,516
I have good news and bad news.

429
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:27,683
What do you want first?

430
00:24:27,718 --> 00:24:28,851
Is this a riddle?

431
00:24:28,886 --> 00:24:30,953
Never mind.

432
00:24:30,988 --> 00:24:32,488
Bad news:
the manuscript's on loan

433
00:24:32,523 --> 00:24:33,656
to the National Army Museum

434
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:35,157
in London.

435
00:24:35,192 --> 00:24:36,325
London.
Mm-hmm.

436
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,561
That's a three-month voyage
by sea.

437
00:24:38,595 --> 00:24:40,229
That's where
the good news comes in.

438
00:24:40,264 --> 00:24:41,998
They've uploaded
the manuscript online.

439
00:24:42,032 --> 00:24:44,333
That is excellent news.

440
00:24:44,368 --> 00:24:46,602
You have no idea what
I'm talking about, do you?

441
00:24:46,637 --> 00:24:47,737
No, I do not.

442
00:24:53,544 --> 00:24:55,511
Oh, uh...

443
00:24:55,546 --> 00:24:56,512
(tapping keyboard)

444
00:24:56,547 --> 00:24:58,381
(murmuring)

445
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:01,684
I really hope you're right
about this manuscript.

446
00:25:01,718 --> 00:25:04,420
12 hours until the
Horseman rides again.

447
00:25:05,656 --> 00:25:09,559
Uh, Lieutenant, I've done
something catastrophic.

448
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:22,271
You printed this five times.

449
00:25:22,306 --> 00:25:23,439
Correct.

450
00:25:23,473 --> 00:25:24,607
Why?

451
00:25:24,641 --> 00:25:26,242
In case the picture
vanishes from the screen

452
00:25:26,276 --> 00:25:27,977
like it did a moment ago.

453
00:25:35,485 --> 00:25:38,654
The manuscript-- written
in some kind of code.

454
00:25:40,691 --> 00:25:42,758
Adams would have used
a Vigenère cipher.

455
00:25:45,429 --> 00:25:47,830
I vaguely remember that
from Criminology 101.

456
00:25:47,864 --> 00:25:49,298
It's similar
to a Caesar shift cipher,

457
00:25:49,333 --> 00:25:51,567
but instead of shifting
the alphabet based on a letter,

458
00:25:51,602 --> 00:25:53,169
it's based on a word.

459
00:25:53,203 --> 00:25:55,905
A VigenÃ¨re cipher is several
Caesar ciphers in a sequence

460
00:25:55,939 --> 00:25:57,473
with different shift values.

461
00:25:57,507 --> 00:26:00,076
Therefore,
without the code word,

462
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:02,345
the text is impossible
to decrypt.

463
00:26:02,379 --> 00:26:04,513
Oh, so you're looking
for a password?

464
00:26:04,548 --> 00:26:08,017
This is definitely
your area of expertise.

465
00:26:08,051 --> 00:26:09,251
Flummoxed by a foreign concept

466
00:26:09,286 --> 00:26:12,021
that resembles close to nothing
of what you know?

467
00:26:12,055 --> 00:26:14,423
Can't imagine how that feels.

468
00:26:17,194 --> 00:26:20,329
(ringtone playing)

469
00:26:20,364 --> 00:26:22,331
I'm trying to crack a
very complicated code.

470
00:26:22,366 --> 00:26:23,799
Is that noise going to cease?

471
00:26:23,834 --> 00:26:26,268
I must have quietude
to concentrate.

472
00:26:26,303 --> 00:26:27,603
Calm down.

473
00:26:27,638 --> 00:26:29,705
I'm gonna make a quick call,

474
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:32,708
uh, give you some privacy.

475
00:26:32,743 --> 00:26:34,176
If you're going
to annul an engagement

476
00:26:34,211 --> 00:26:35,811
with a man who works
across the street,

477
00:26:35,846 --> 00:26:38,681
don't you think
you should do it in person?

478
00:26:38,715 --> 00:26:40,483
How do you know I'm meeting
with Luke later?

479
00:26:40,517 --> 00:26:43,119
You're much easier to read
than a VigenÃ¨re cipher.

480
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:48,658
(indistinct radio transmissions)

481
00:26:48,692 --> 00:26:50,693
(phone ringing)

482
00:26:55,132 --> 00:26:56,832
<i>BROOKS (distorted):
There are others like me.</i>

483
00:26:56,867 --> 00:26:58,000
<i>Except for the chosen few.</i>

484
00:26:58,035 --> 00:26:59,301
<i>There's a war going on,
Morales.</i>

485
00:27:02,572 --> 00:27:03,806
<i>Watching.</i>

486
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,807
<i>I saw you with Abbie Mills.</i>

487
00:27:04,841 --> 00:27:05,975
<i>Waiting.</i>

488
00:27:06,977 --> 00:27:08,778
(ringtone playing)

489
00:27:08,812 --> 00:27:10,613
<i>Stay away from her.</i>

490
00:27:10,647 --> 00:27:13,282
(ringtone playing)

491
00:27:13,316 --> 00:27:14,850
<i>I trust you'll make
the right decision.</i>

492
00:27:15,686 --> 00:27:18,220
(ringtone playing)

493
00:27:18,255 --> 00:27:20,156
<i>Stay away from Abbie Mills.</i>

494
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:21,957
<i>I'm the only one
that can protect her.</i>

495
00:27:21,992 --> 00:27:23,292
(ringtone playing)

496
00:27:27,898 --> 00:27:29,632
Hey, this is Luke.
Leave me a message.

497
00:27:29,666 --> 00:27:30,833
Hey, Luke, it's Abbie.

498
00:27:30,867 --> 00:27:32,702
I know we were supposed
to have coffee today,

499
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,003
but something just came up

500
00:27:34,037 --> 00:27:35,871
and I'm not gonna be able
to make it,

501
00:27:35,906 --> 00:27:37,740
so give me a call
when you get this

502
00:27:37,774 --> 00:27:41,310
and we'll figure out
another time.

503
00:27:41,344 --> 00:27:42,745
Okay.

504
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:45,314
Okay, talk soon.

505
00:27:49,619 --> 00:27:51,220
(Brooks groans)

506
00:27:51,254 --> 00:27:53,222
Andy?

507
00:27:54,124 --> 00:27:56,025
You're supposed to be dead.

508
00:27:56,059 --> 00:27:58,360
(crunches)

509
00:27:58,395 --> 00:28:00,362
(grunts)

510
00:28:00,397 --> 00:28:02,765
I am dead.

511
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:05,534
Is that not apparent?

512
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:11,107
Brooks... what happened?

513
00:28:11,141 --> 00:28:13,909
Abbie, I'm, I'm stuck.

514
00:28:15,746 --> 00:28:18,380
I want this to end,
but he won't let me.

515
00:28:18,415 --> 00:28:20,616
You sold your soul?

516
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:24,353
I know you don't believe me,
but I'm trying to protect you.

517
00:28:26,256 --> 00:28:28,257
(tapping keyboard)

518
00:28:35,465 --> 00:28:37,133
Well, how did we get here?

519
00:28:39,503 --> 00:28:42,104
Well, that is wildly
inappropriate.

520
00:28:42,139 --> 00:28:43,839
Hey, sexy.

521
00:28:43,874 --> 00:28:45,441
Want to chat?

522
00:28:45,475 --> 00:28:46,675
(clears throat)

523
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:48,844
Well, I'm flattered, madam,

524
00:28:48,879 --> 00:28:51,747
but I'm afraid
I am espoused to another.

525
00:28:51,782 --> 00:28:53,816
Ooh.

526
00:29:01,346 --> 00:29:02,993
Still here.

527
00:29:30,987 --> 00:29:33,989
â™ª

528
00:29:40,363 --> 00:29:42,865
Cicero is the password.

529
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:47,703
Oh, Revere, you rum beggar.

530
00:29:49,072 --> 00:29:52,041
You hid the password
on the back of his teeth.

531
00:29:59,693 --> 00:30:01,427
The Horseman won't
stop coming after you

532
00:30:01,461 --> 00:30:03,262
until he gets his head.

533
00:30:03,296 --> 00:30:05,598
Well, that's not gonna happen.

534
00:30:05,632 --> 00:30:08,167
Horseman's indestructible,
Abbie, he is Death.

535
00:30:08,201 --> 00:30:10,269
We're getting that idea,
thank you.

536
00:30:10,303 --> 00:30:11,537
That's what I'm here
to tell you.

537
00:30:11,571 --> 00:30:15,141
You can't kill Death,
but you can trap him.

538
00:30:15,175 --> 00:30:17,743
That's the only way
you can defeat him.

539
00:30:19,513 --> 00:30:21,480
<i>ABBIE:
How?</i>

540
00:30:21,515 --> 00:30:24,116
<i>BROOKS:
I don't know.</i>

541
00:30:24,151 --> 00:30:26,485
<i>I just know it's a secret
he doesn't want let out.</i>

542
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,820
Brilliant.

543
00:30:27,854 --> 00:30:29,555
Why should I believe
anything that you say?

544
00:30:29,589 --> 00:30:30,990
Because I care
about you, Abbie.

545
00:30:35,529 --> 00:30:37,530
Is that the sheriff's turncoat?

546
00:30:37,532 --> 00:30:39,765
Andy Boks.

547
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:41,634
My name is Andy Brooks.

548
00:30:41,668 --> 00:30:44,069
We saw you die in that cell.

549
00:30:44,104 --> 00:30:45,804
Yeah.

550
00:30:46,706 --> 00:30:49,074
It's not my best day.

551
00:30:53,046 --> 00:30:55,447
Are you still in communication
with the Horseman?

552
00:30:55,482 --> 00:31:00,152
I am... but that's
not why I'm here.

553
00:31:00,187 --> 00:31:01,687
I want to help Abbie.

554
00:31:04,691 --> 00:31:06,592
Here's how you can help.

555
00:31:06,626 --> 00:31:09,428
Deliver this message
to the Horseman:

556
00:31:09,462 --> 00:31:11,497
if he wants his head back,

557
00:31:11,531 --> 00:31:14,300
he can meet me at the cemetery
when night falls.

558
00:31:17,904 --> 00:31:21,607
Okay, I'll tell him.

559
00:31:23,109 --> 00:31:26,245
If you return here,
there will be consequences.

560
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:27,479
Do you understand?

561
00:31:27,514 --> 00:31:30,049
Don't threaten me.

562
00:31:42,062 --> 00:31:45,064
You all right?

563
00:31:45,098 --> 00:31:47,066
(sighs)

564
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,634
(cocks gun)

565
00:31:48,668 --> 00:31:50,636
He said the Horseman
can't be killed.

566
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:52,571
Only trapped.

567
00:31:52,606 --> 00:31:54,573
He's right.

568
00:31:54,608 --> 00:31:56,909
And I think I know how.

569
00:31:56,943 --> 00:31:59,845
I cracked the code.

570
00:31:59,879 --> 00:32:01,847
You've got crazy
good handwriting.

571
00:32:01,881 --> 00:32:03,282
This?

572
00:32:03,316 --> 00:32:05,017
Chicken scratch.

573
00:32:05,019 --> 00:32:07,886
There is a lot of useful
information in this manuscript.

574
00:32:07,921 --> 00:32:11,390
I'm not surprised the Horseman
wanted it destroyed.

575
00:32:11,424 --> 00:32:14,860
<i>1782, the Masons updated
this manuscript</i>

576
00:32:14,894 --> 00:32:17,096
<i>with a way to defeat
the Horseman of Death.</i>

577
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:20,266
<i>Then Paul Revere engraved the
key to decoding the manuscript,</i>

578
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,868
<i>the word "Cicero," in the back
of the Horseman's teeth.</i>

579
00:32:22,902 --> 00:32:25,437
What did he say about
the Horseman, post-beheading?

580
00:32:25,472 --> 00:32:27,406
(papers rustling)

581
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,575
"Death cannot be slain,

582
00:32:29,609 --> 00:32:33,279
"but it can be captured and
caged against its fiery will.

583
00:32:33,313 --> 00:32:35,114
"As sunlight is
his only weakness,

584
00:32:35,148 --> 00:32:36,749
"a witch must be summoned

585
00:32:36,783 --> 00:32:38,584
"to cast a spell,
transforming the moon

586
00:32:38,618 --> 00:32:41,420
into the sun,
whilst Death is exposed."

587
00:32:41,454 --> 00:32:43,889
Great. We need a witch.

588
00:32:43,923 --> 00:32:46,558
Too bad we can't
summon your wife.

589
00:32:46,593 --> 00:32:50,062
Yes, the thought
had crossed my mind, thank you,

590
00:32:50,096 --> 00:32:52,965
though not as a means
to defeat our present enemy.

591
00:32:52,999 --> 00:32:56,268
Sorry. Understood.

592
00:32:56,303 --> 00:33:01,473
Perhaps there are still witches
in Sleepy Hollow?

593
00:33:04,411 --> 00:33:06,111
Lieutenant?

594
00:33:06,146 --> 00:33:08,113
When Adams wrote
in this manuscript,

595
00:33:08,148 --> 00:33:11,784
witches were the only means
of creating sunlight at night.

596
00:33:11,818 --> 00:33:15,220
But today, we have UV light,
ultraviolet

597
00:33:15,255 --> 00:33:17,156
light, also known as
artificial sunlight.

598
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:19,892
It's the modern version of
what Adams was talking about.

599
00:33:19,926 --> 00:33:21,994
We can simulate the sun.

600
00:33:23,663 --> 00:33:26,799
Well, as long as it doesn't
include the 'ninnanet,'

601
00:33:26,833 --> 00:33:28,467
then, I'm amenable.

602
00:33:28,501 --> 00:33:31,103
(slurping loudly through straw)

603
00:33:31,137 --> 00:33:33,005
Aah!

604
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:34,940
(laughing):
Stop!

605
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:39,578
No excuses.

606
00:33:40,814 --> 00:33:42,581
You guys have had straws
for a millennium.

607
00:33:42,615 --> 00:33:46,285
Mm. This water was free
at the market.

608
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:48,654
So was the arsenic
that comes with it.

609
00:33:50,857 --> 00:33:52,991
So, we have to lure him
into the tunnels.

610
00:33:53,026 --> 00:33:54,193
Any ideas?

611
00:33:54,227 --> 00:33:55,694
A few.

612
00:33:55,729 --> 00:33:56,962
Though they require supplies

613
00:33:56,996 --> 00:33:58,997
which could take
some time to prepare.

614
00:33:59,032 --> 00:34:01,133
I'm not sure
they'll be completed by sundown.

615
00:34:01,167 --> 00:34:03,102
What if we got help?

616
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:05,170
<i>IRVING:
Assuming this works,</i>

617
00:34:05,205 --> 00:34:07,639
which is generous,
say we trap him.

618
00:34:07,674 --> 00:34:09,675
Where are we gonna keep him?

619
00:34:09,709 --> 00:34:11,810
I'm not dropping him
in the drunk tank.

620
00:34:11,845 --> 00:34:12,945
The Masons have a cell protected

621
00:34:12,979 --> 00:34:14,813
by a supernatural
barrier, designed

622
00:34:14,848 --> 00:34:15,981
by Thomas Jefferson.

623
00:34:16,015 --> 00:34:17,683
Jefferson. Huh.

624
00:34:17,717 --> 00:34:19,818
What was he like?

625
00:34:19,853 --> 00:34:21,887
Oh, a true Renaissance man.

626
00:34:21,921 --> 00:34:23,756
Artisan, scholar.

627
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:25,791
How do you figure
a guy who wrote,

628
00:34:25,825 --> 00:34:28,193
"All men are created equal"

629
00:34:28,228 --> 00:34:31,130
justified owning slaves?

630
00:34:31,164 --> 00:34:32,564
That's actually
a good question.

631
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:35,167
I can say with some certainty

632
00:34:35,201 --> 00:34:37,536
that he recognized
the severe immorality of it.

633
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:39,571
He supported
abolition in Virginia.

634
00:34:39,606 --> 00:34:42,007
Perhaps his firsthand experience
added to his eloquence

635
00:34:42,041 --> 00:34:44,109
in drafting a document used
to justify it.

636
00:34:44,144 --> 00:34:45,711
ABBIE:
Or

637
00:34:45,745 --> 00:34:48,380
maybe Sally Hemings
inspired him.

638
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:52,818
Who is Miss Hemings?

639
00:34:52,852 --> 00:34:54,586
Hogwash!

640
00:34:54,621 --> 00:34:56,255
Thomas was a loyal husband.

641
00:34:56,289 --> 00:34:58,824
Your press knows no bounds!

642
00:34:58,858 --> 00:35:01,860
They still favor
salacious speculation to fact.

643
00:35:01,895 --> 00:35:03,028
I once said to Thomas,

644
00:35:03,062 --> 00:35:04,763
"A man who reads nothing at all

645
00:35:04,798 --> 00:35:06,198
"is better educated than a man

646
00:35:06,232 --> 00:35:07,833
who reads nothing
but newspapers."

647
00:35:07,867 --> 00:35:10,669
We had a good laugh
about that one.

648
00:35:14,073 --> 00:35:16,074
I hate to burst your bubble,

649
00:35:16,109 --> 00:35:18,544
but we have something called
DNA evidence,

650
00:35:18,578 --> 00:35:22,681
which scientifically proves
that your pal Thomas Jefferson

651
00:35:22,715 --> 00:35:26,285
fathered six kids by one
of his slaves-- Sally Hemings.

652
00:35:26,319 --> 00:35:29,354
ABBIE: And not to kick
you while you're down,

653
00:35:29,389 --> 00:35:33,225
but... Jefferson took credit
for your line about the press.

654
00:35:35,094 --> 00:35:37,296
Well...

655
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:41,733
we never really know people,
do we?

656
00:35:41,768 --> 00:35:44,503
Should be ten minutes
or so till sundown.

657
00:35:44,537 --> 00:35:46,939
The seventh time
you've checked.

658
00:35:48,975 --> 00:35:50,776
I suspect you're also
awaiting news from Luke.

659
00:35:52,979 --> 00:35:55,514
Oh, it's probably for the best.

660
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:59,218
Not like
we could've had a real...

661
00:35:59,252 --> 00:36:01,119
real friendship or anything.

662
00:36:02,655 --> 00:36:05,224
And why is that?

663
00:36:10,864 --> 00:36:12,931
It's always gonna be this.

664
00:36:12,966 --> 00:36:15,400
Canceling last minute,
lying about it,

665
00:36:15,435 --> 00:36:17,002
keeping secrets.

666
00:36:17,036 --> 00:36:18,537
The most important parts
of my life,

667
00:36:18,571 --> 00:36:20,072
the parts
that I want to share--

668
00:36:20,106 --> 00:36:22,641
they're off limits.

669
00:36:22,675 --> 00:36:24,643
So what's the point?

670
00:36:25,979 --> 00:36:27,312
Why are you smiling?

671
00:36:29,349 --> 00:36:32,551
Katrina once expressed
a similar view.

672
00:36:32,585 --> 00:36:35,187
She believed a liaison with me

673
00:36:35,221 --> 00:36:37,356
would compromise our roles
in the war.

674
00:36:38,358 --> 00:36:40,392
I suppose she wasn't wrong.

675
00:36:41,394 --> 00:36:42,961
If you hadn't been in love,

676
00:36:42,996 --> 00:36:44,963
she would've let you die
with the Horseman.

677
00:36:44,998 --> 00:36:46,965
Most likely.

678
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,500
She wouldn't be in Purgatory.

679
00:36:48,535 --> 00:36:50,402
Also true.
And you wouldn't be here.

680
00:36:50,436 --> 00:36:51,937
Stuck in the modern era,

681
00:36:51,971 --> 00:36:55,541
where everyone I care about
has been dead for 200 years.

682
00:36:55,575 --> 00:36:57,209
That must be hard.

683
00:36:57,243 --> 00:36:59,278
It's an adjustment.

684
00:37:03,349 --> 00:37:05,784
If it makes you feel
any better,

685
00:37:05,818 --> 00:37:09,688
I feel pretty alone
sometimes, too.

686
00:37:09,722 --> 00:37:14,226
Perhaps this is the sacrifice
that witnesses must carry.

687
00:37:15,728 --> 00:37:17,696
All we really get...

688
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:20,032
is one another.

689
00:37:25,605 --> 00:37:27,606
(laughs)

690
00:37:30,426 --> 00:37:32,393
Sun's almost down.

691
00:37:32,428 --> 00:37:34,896
The Horseman's going to ride.

692
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:37,565
It's time.

693
00:37:47,407 --> 00:37:49,608
(thunder crackling)

694
00:37:51,478 --> 00:37:54,280
CRANE:
I received your message.

695
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:57,149
My reply.

696
00:37:57,184 --> 00:38:00,019
(horse neighing)

697
00:38:04,858 --> 00:38:06,325
(thunder crackling)

698
00:38:14,534 --> 00:38:16,235
(gunshot)

699
00:38:24,911 --> 00:38:27,179
(neighing)

700
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:32,518
(neighing)

701
00:38:35,589 --> 00:38:37,590
(thunderclaps)

702
00:38:46,133 --> 00:38:47,500
(panting)

703
00:38:49,603 --> 00:38:50,536
(grunts)

704
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:53,939
Oh, that was... terrifying.

705
00:39:19,299 --> 00:39:21,367
(cackling)

706
00:39:39,986 --> 00:39:42,721
ABBIE:
Hey.

707
00:39:42,756 --> 00:39:44,256
Do you want to talk about it?

708
00:39:44,291 --> 00:39:46,725
Feeling mocked yet?

709
00:39:49,596 --> 00:39:50,896
(gasps)

710
00:39:52,032 --> 00:39:53,766
Snuff the light!

711
00:40:12,219 --> 00:40:15,287
ABBIE:
Crane, I'm hurt.

712
00:40:15,322 --> 00:40:18,357
I think I broke my ankle.

713
00:40:18,391 --> 00:40:20,392
(groaning)

714
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:26,031
Crane, help me.

715
00:40:26,066 --> 00:40:28,167
Keep quiet.
I'm coming for you.

716
00:40:28,201 --> 00:40:30,336
Crane?!

717
00:40:32,172 --> 00:40:33,839
(Abbie gasps)

718
00:40:33,874 --> 00:40:35,808
Crane, he's here! (gasping)

719
00:40:36,909 --> 00:40:37,976
Now!

720
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:40,879
(clacking)

721
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:44,472
(gasping)

722
00:40:57,863 --> 00:41:08,763
