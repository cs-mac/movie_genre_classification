1
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:36,295
Terri!

2
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:41,198
You clean up the tub ring?

3
00:00:41,274 --> 00:00:43,868
I'm still in here, Uncle James.

4
00:00:43,943 --> 00:00:46,707
Did you?
Last night you said you'd clean it up.

5
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:52,679
I can't clean it
because I'm still in here, okay?

6
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:57,682
You'll be late for school, Terri.

7
00:00:57,757 --> 00:01:00,555
Do you want me to go to school
or do you want me to clean the tub,

8
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:02,618
because I can't do both.

9
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:06,591
I'm hungry. You cook us up some steaks.

10
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:10,232
No. Those are for dinner, okay?

11
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:13,861
How about I make us 
some beans on toast?

12
00:01:14,531 --> 00:01:15,673
How's that sound?

13
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:56,525
- Hey, guys, come on. Let's go.
- Why didn't you pass it to me?

14
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:58,127
- Go.
- All right.

15
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,105
Yeah, wait up.

16
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:09,345
Zach, wait up!

17
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:26,556
Hey, slow down!

18
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,148
For all you people
who want to blame the camera

19
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:51,918
for your bad yearbook picture,
recent freshman's shot.

20
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:57,059
- But don't look for us, though.
- Because we nailed our pictures!

21
00:04:57,163 --> 00:04:58,425
Yeah! I know I did!

22
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:00,227
- Until tomorrow, peace!
- Peace!

23
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,130
Peace.

24
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:05,902
All right, people,
I got a couple of announcements to make.

25
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:09,497
Want to remind you that those
large, round, metal receptacles

26
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:10,974
you see around campus?

27
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:12,773
They're for trash. Use them.

28
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:15,846
- Hey!
- National Honor Society essays

29
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:18,213
and applications deadline
is next Wednesday.

30
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:19,410
You can give them to me,

31
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,816
- or there's a designated box...
- Yo.

32
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:22,821
...in the main office.
- Trash heap.

33
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:24,322
- You know this?
- The Pioneers will be playing

34
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:26,492
three away games this month
and the team needs drivers.

35
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:28,720
- You know this. Shit is old school.
- And if anyone's parent can volunteer,

36
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:30,495
please have them contact...

37
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:32,463
- Old school?
- Hip-hop.

38
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:34,690
Go Pioneers!

39
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:38,294
- Rappers get all the pussy.
- We're instituting a no-tolerance policy...

40
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:39,929
...against cell phones.
- Okay.

41
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,600
If you're found texting or... Yes, Terri.

42
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:44,677
May I go to the restroom, please?

43
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,745
You just got here. Absolutely not.

44
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:50,078
If you're found texting or using
your phone in class,

45
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:53,209
phone will be confiscated and returned
to you at the end of the school day.

46
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:56,255
You may use the phone
during nutrition and lunch.

47
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,721
- You know about eating pussy, right?
- The library

48
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,987
will be closed intermittently next week
while construction's going on.

49
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,223
And if your study hall is being relocated,
there will be a notice posted by the door.

50
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:06,265
Why are you doing this?

51
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:08,127
We're all aware of the false...

52
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,192
Players be choking to death on the pussy.

53
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:11,702
...disruptions to the entire school,
as well as...

54
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:13,568
Okay, I get it. Okay?

55
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:17,666
Do not take it lightly
and, then, the authorities will not either.

56
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:19,968
You know about eating butt holes, right?

57
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,181
- I said I get it!
- Terri!

58
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:25,375
Chill out, titty-balls. Damn!

59
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:27,112
Titty-balls.

60
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:30,615
Has reminded me
to ask you not to leave food in your lockers.

61
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:15,625
Mr. Ribis, I see you brought
a hat to school today.

62
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:18,363
- Yes, I did, sir.
- You know that I collect hats.

63
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:23,372
I have a large collection.

64
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:27,179
If you would like your hat
to stay yours and not mine,

65
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:30,147
I suggest you put it in your
backpack and keep it there.

66
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:33,447
- Go to class, Mr. Ribis.
- You got it, Mr. Fitzgerald.

67
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:23,065
We have mice in the attic.

68
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,096
We have to do something about this.

69
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,697
We have valuable documents up there.

70
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,737
Feeling better, Uncle James?

71
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:35,112
Up and down.

72
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:37,648
I'm gonna go to the market
and get some traps and some cheddar.

73
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:41,550
You can set the traps tonight
before bedtime, okay?

74
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:45,221
I don't want to do that, Uncle James.

75
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:48,849
Well, if I set them, I'll forget to check.

76
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:51,556
- I can remind you.
- No, Terri.

77
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:53,455
You have no chores.

78
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,797
You have no one breathing down your neck.

79
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,995
I mean, you live a prince's life here.
You know that.

80
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:00,971
- I know.
- Good.

81
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:04,338
I'm gonna set up the ladder
next to the crawl space.

82
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:02,566
I want to talk to you
about my boyfriend.

83
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:03,795
Well, I don't want to talk to you.

84
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:05,496
Oh, you tango divine!

85
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,866
I don't know if you have heard,

86
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,070
but there's going to come a time...

87
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:27,625
How did we do up there?

88
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:31,956
Terri?

89
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:35,762
- Five mice!
- That's not bad.

90
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:44,141
Well, we'll put them in the marsh.

91
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,002
Let the other animals pick them off.

92
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,040
Just think of it
as feeding the animals, Terri.

93
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,579
- I'm hurrying as fast as I can.
- I just really don't want

94
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,239
- Mrs. Vick to...
- All right, class.

95
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,612
Now today we're going to learn
how to crack an egg.

96
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,517
- Do you know how to crack an egg?
- No.

97
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:31,317
I'm sure you think you do,
but there is a special way.

98
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:34,120
Now what you do is,
one, two, three, crack.

99
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,990
It's all in the wrist.

100
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:38,997
One, two, three, crack. Wrist.

101
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:40,822
It's so easy and a way...

102
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:45,426
I just want to be with you.
This is just the perfect moment.

103
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:46,528
All right, come on, come on.

104
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:48,937
I know you guys think
you'll never lose your memory,

105
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:50,475
but believe me, you will.

106
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,908
One, two, three, crack.

107
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:46,147
Ms. Hamish,
please send Terri Thompson in.

108
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:20,842
Terri Thompson.

109
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:25,386
I had hoped we wouldn't
have to meet like this.

110
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:28,223
In fact, I was sure we wouldn't have to.

111
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:32,559
Do you know all the students' names?

112
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:36,092
No, it wouldn't be possible for me
to know all the students' names.

113
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:38,995
- No.
- Why do you...

114
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:42,133
I mean, how do you know mine?

115
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:48,771
Well, every year there's two groups of kids,
who stand out here.

116
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:51,010
Okay?

117
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,880
There's the good-hearted kids.

118
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,687
And there's the bad-hearted kids.

119
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,287
And those are the ones
whose names I learn.

120
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,257
And which one am I?

121
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:07,661
Don't you know, dude?

122
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,400
I don't know if I know.

123
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:15,638
Well, you strike me as one of
the good-hearted ones, Terri,

124
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:19,301
which is why I'm upset
that we have to meet here today,

125
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:21,141
for reasons of discipline.

126
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:23,174
Sit down, Markson!

127
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:25,740
Sit down! In the chair!

128
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:35,086
There's something wrong with that kid.

129
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:37,321
Is he one of the bad hearts?

130
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:41,097
No. With him, we're dealing
with a third category.

131
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,631
As yet, unnamed and unknowable.

132
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:47,402
Where were we?

133
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:51,941
You were getting mad
at me about my tardies.

134
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:54,277
No. Um...

135
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:58,348
Listen, you want a Malt Ball?

136
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:01,314
Yeah. Thank you.

137
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:07,524
I'm not mad, but

138
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,222
we have a real problem here
on our hands,

139
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,131
and I'm for dealing with it head-on.

140
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:19,270
What do you think about that?

141
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:22,303
Okay.

142
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:23,430
Okay.

143
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:26,741
Good.

144
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:49,830
Well, what's the deal?

145
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:54,629
Your grades are dropping.

146
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,505
Your teachers are telling me
you won't participate in the lessons,

147
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:02,046
you've begun to wear pajamas every day.

148
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:04,938
Do you understand,

149
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:09,751
from my perspective, how those things
could be categorized as red flags?

150
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:11,349
They're just comfortable on me.

151
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:15,455
Why are you late
to school every day, Terri?

152
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:27,832
- It's getting harder to be able...
- Okay.

153
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,599
Okay.

154
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:35,339
Stop right there.

155
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:53,326
- You all right there, Ms. Hamish?
- Fine.

156
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:56,691
You're just clearing out the old pipes, huh?

157
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,761
Dynamite. Listen, do me a favor.

158
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,698
Set aside my Monday mornings
for Terri Thompson.

159
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:09,004
Terri Thomp...

160
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:12,806
Thomp... Thomp...

161
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:16,681
And if you could also let
Mrs. Davidson know

162
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:20,122
that Terri is mine
on Monday mornings, please.

163
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:21,851
All right?

164
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:25,385
T-H-O-M...

165
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:31,096
So here's what I'm proposing.

166
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:35,400
We meet once a week
and check in with each other.

167
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:39,541
See how we're faring against the world.

168
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,810
You know what I mean?

169
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:47,812
Really?

170
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:54,056
What is weird about two guys sitting down,
sharing snacks and shooting the breeze?

171
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:57,952
- Nothing, I guess.
- Nothing is right, dude.

172
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:00,254
And by the way,

173
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:03,732
you get out of homeroom
at the beginning of each week.

174
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:05,229
Come on! Are you kidding me?

175
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:08,570
Up high! Fitzy needs a high five.

176
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,360
All the traps were empty this morning.

177
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:41,038
That's very good, Terri. We won't be
seeing those boys anymore, will we?

178
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:45,538
No, I think they'll come back,
probably next week.

179
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:48,006
- I bet they'll come back.
- Mmm.

180
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,237
I don't think so.

181
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:52,340
Once you dispatch that front line,

182
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:55,045
the troops always fall back
for safer ground.

183
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:59,123
You know, they got to find their food
in the woods like before.

184
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:05,425
You got plans for the weekend?

185
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:34,414
A hummingbird in flight
has the highest metabolism of all animals

186
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:36,688
with the exception of insects,

187
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:40,664
which is necessary to support
the rapid beating of their wings.

188
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:44,429
Incubation can last two to three weeks.

189
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:46,227
After hatching...

190
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:31,872
What's this about cheddar cheese?
When did you start liking that?

191
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:38,117
I don't understand.

192
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:41,390
I need you to explain this to me.

193
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:46,954
You enjoyed hurting these animals,
is that it?

194
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:57,033
I don't know.

195
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:01,608
Well, I'm so ashamed.

196
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:07,017
I didn't even know you were capable
of doing something so ugly.

197
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:24,062
It's like I went crazy or something.

198
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:28,004
I've never done
anything like that before.

199
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,873
It's bloodlust, dude.

200
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:38,249
It can be a hard habit to break, they say,
once you get started in on it.

201
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:40,911
I think I'm going to become a vegetarian.

202
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,554
Whoa. Wait a minute now.

203
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:48,015
Let's not get carried away.
I mean, you are remorseful.

204
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,228
And that's a positive.

205
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:54,755
I knew a kid growing up that used
to tie flaming tennis balls to cats' tails,

206
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:55,959
and loved every minute of it.

207
00:23:56,668 --> 00:23:58,363
Apparently, he's a cop now.

208
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:01,873
Anyway, the thing about
this mouse scenario is

209
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:05,773
even if your uncle says he doesn't
understand why you did it,

210
00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:09,372
guess what, he does.

211
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:14,612
He does and so do I. All right?

212
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,650
Now, that's not to say
that it's not wrong or weird

213
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:19,815
because, believe me, it is.

214
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:25,854
But it's important for you to get
that we get it, okay? We get it!

215
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,760
Right?

216
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:41,078
Open your legs. Okay?

217
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:51,684
What the hell is your problem?
You promised me.

218
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:53,519
Open your damn legs.

219
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:58,219
Terri, can you do the French toast?

220
00:25:03,034 --> 00:25:06,470
- Hello, Earth to Terri.
- What?

221
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:09,471
- You're on French toast, okay?
- Yeah, sure.

222
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:36,091
Oh, my God.

223
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,069
What, Terri?

224
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,438
What? What?

225
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:49,038
Guys.

226
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,981
Oh, my God.

227
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:56,881
- Oh, my God.
- Seriously?

228
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:58,923
- I can't believe they're doing that in class.
- Oh, my God.

229
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:01,254
- In class. In class.
- So gross.

230
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:04,452
Hey, guys, come over here.

231
00:26:05,797 --> 00:26:08,425
Do you see that? Right below the desk.

232
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:12,998
You stud.

233
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:16,871
- Is he so desperate to get some?
- I'd say.

234
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:27,816
Damn, dude.

235
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:36,058
Oh, my God.

236
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:41,026
Oh, my God!

237
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:43,960
What is it?

238
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:52,607
- Tell me what it is.
- Come here.

239
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,955
Is it true?

240
00:27:12,664 --> 00:27:14,723
- Is it true?
- Yeah. Yeah, here.

241
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,626
- It's true.
- It's true!

242
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,470
- Watch the finger.
- I'm sorry.

243
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,939
Let me see it again!
Let me see it again!

244
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:28,673
Watch it! Watch it!

245
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:30,846
Come on, use your traps.

246
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:32,473
That's it. All right.

247
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:36,680
I got a nose down here, so don't...
Don't kick back. Push!

248
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:39,914
Hey!

249
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,992
Mr. Thompson, we've been waiting for you.

250
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:48,298
I'm sorry, Mr. Flemisch.
There was a hold-up last period.

251
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:50,025
A what? A hold-up?

252
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:54,396
What do you mean, like a robbery?
Like a bandido-esque...

253
00:27:58,176 --> 00:27:59,165
You know, let me ask you something.

254
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:02,941
This is something that's been bothering
me for quite a while now.

255
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:07,576
Why do you bear so blatant a grudge
towards physical education and wellness?

256
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,947
Hey, Mr. Flemisch.

257
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:14,817
- I don't think grudge is the right word.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

258
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:16,656
Well, let's get it right, then.

259
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:21,461
How do you feel about physical education
and wellness, Terri? Hmm?

260
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:28,339
The feeling is no feeling.

261
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:32,302
All right, Terri.
Well, I got some news for you.

262
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:35,505
After warm-ups today, we're going
to start working on the high jumps.

263
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:38,214
Now, will you or will you not participate?

264
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:40,615
And I encourage you to think
before you answer.

265
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:44,380
I will not.

266
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:47,822
Well, then you get out of my gymnasium
and don't come back!

267
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:48,984
Shit!

268
00:28:57,802 --> 00:28:58,791
Ms. Miles!

269
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:02,332
Mr. Ribis, you are in deep doo-doo!

270
00:29:02,807 --> 00:29:05,503
No, I'm not mad. I am furious!

271
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:11,348
I am disappointed because I just
lost two average students.

272
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:15,547
This kind of thing is punishable by law!

273
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,417
- What's wrong, Marcus?
- Are you out of your mind?

274
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:22,483
Those guys got in trouble
and it made my meeting stop.

275
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:25,390
Don't worry, Marcus.
You'll be back in there soon.

276
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:28,693
I don't know how much more
these two lovebirds can take.

277
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:31,630
Do you meet with Mr. Fitzgerald
every Monday?

278
00:29:34,806 --> 00:29:37,104
Who all comes into these meetings,
Ms. Hamish?

279
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:44,272
Well, let's see.

280
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:48,074
On Mondays, there's you and Marcus.

281
00:29:48,586 --> 00:29:51,020
And on Tuesdays, Amber Zane.

282
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:54,290
- Amber Zane?
- That's right.

283
00:29:55,426 --> 00:29:57,690
And on Wednesdays, there's
that little boy in the wheelchair.

284
00:29:57,829 --> 00:30:00,059
I can never remember his name.

285
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:01,592
Donny Washburn.

286
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,966
Oh! Donny. That's right.

287
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:08,966
And on Fridays, there's Chad Markson.

288
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,977
It's quite a group.

289
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:27,756
Terri? What's up, dude? You all right?

290
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:30,356
Good hearts my ass!

291
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:39,162
Fuck.

292
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:33,250
Nice pajamas, man.

293
00:32:12,463 --> 00:32:14,658
Uncle James? Are you okay?

294
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,498
Terri, what are you doing here?

295
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:21,564
Did you take too many pills?

296
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:24,864
I just need to be near some bodies.

297
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:27,867
- Come on, let's get you home.
- Okay.

298
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:53,790
Terri?

299
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:57,625
Check it out. Double D's got a shit slip.

300
00:33:58,803 --> 00:34:02,330
People, hush! Terri, go.

301
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:21,182
What did you do?

302
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,660
I cut school yesterday.

303
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:33,898
Donny, wait out here
one second, will you?

304
00:34:45,316 --> 00:34:47,113
- Hey, dudes.
- Hey, Donny.

305
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:48,480
You already done in there?

306
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:50,111
We're taking five
so he can see you guys.

307
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:52,221
Why are you wearing sunglasses?

308
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:54,622
What? Oh. These things?

309
00:34:57,061 --> 00:34:59,052
Seriously, what do you guys do in there,
play volleyball?

310
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:01,188
Cool Breeze Club. Members only.

311
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:02,592
Get your butt in here!

312
00:35:03,901 --> 00:35:05,232
Right now!

313
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:08,303
Uh-oh! Watch out.

314
00:35:08,372 --> 00:35:09,361
What is it with you?

315
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,639
It's always something, isn't it?

316
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:15,174
What did he do? Do you know?

317
00:35:15,546 --> 00:35:17,104
It's bad, dude.

318
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:18,978
He's not too happy
with you ditching either, Terri.

319
00:35:19,183 --> 00:35:22,346
You're off the creek, pal,
and that's three detentions.

320
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,888
Count them, one, two, three.
Now, get out of here.

321
00:35:34,832 --> 00:35:36,390
Geez!

322
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:45,299
Mr. Thompson, we've got a problem!
Get in here. Close the door.

323
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:49,540
- Have a seat.
- Here it comes.

324
00:35:49,614 --> 00:35:51,775
What can you be thinking?

325
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:54,784
- The school is not a country club.
- Heads up.

326
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,679
I'm not really mad at you, okay?

327
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:01,020
Just go along with me, all right?

328
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:04,892
Not an option
for you to be coming in here

329
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:08,056
and try to do that kind of thing
in my school!

330
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:17,899
Sorry, Ter. That was a little show
for old Ms. Hamish out there.

331
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:21,743
She loves it when I lay into you kids.
It's keeping her going.

332
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,941
You yelled and screamed at me for her?

333
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:29,214
Sounds bad, I know. Yeah. Um...

334
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:32,620
The thing is she's not doing so hot.

335
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:36,022
Truth is she's dying.

336
00:36:36,427 --> 00:36:37,792
She's dying now?

337
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:41,093
Not this second, no, but soon.

338
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:45,361
- What is she dying of?
- She's dying of cigarettes.

339
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:49,736
Okay? She's dying of death.

340
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:53,235
Was it all a joke with Chad Markson, too?

341
00:36:53,444 --> 00:36:54,775
No, dude.

342
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:59,707
It's always something with that kid,
and today he outdid himself.

343
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:03,946
I will show you in pictograph form

344
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,452
What I'm talking about.

345
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:15,798
This is what he said to Mr. Flemisch
in front of the entire class today.

346
00:37:17,201 --> 00:37:20,227
Yeah. Yeah, he's a tough one.

347
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:24,235
Very smart and very angry.

348
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:31,271
But, Terri, I didn't call you in here today
to talk about Chad, did I?

349
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:33,344
No.

350
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:35,280
No.

351
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:38,618
I called you in to talk about what
you said in the hallway there.

352
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:40,948
I was mad.

353
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,587
And I don't blame you, dude.

354
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:49,131
- But I think you misunderstood the facts.
- What's to misunderstand?

355
00:37:49,634 --> 00:37:54,799
I'm a part of a group of monsters,
you know?

356
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:05,312
I'm going to show you something,

357
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:10,281
and it's something that I've never shown
to any other student, okay?

358
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:33,239
Come on, Terri. There's something in there
I think might help.

359
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,173
Do you recognize that guy?

360
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:44,412
Cute little baby, happy baby.
Simpler times, right?

361
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:47,585
Moving right along.

362
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,822
And what could go wrong?
It's a Shangri-La.

363
00:38:56,934 --> 00:38:58,026
Boom.

364
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:06,176
Now, whenever I'm down or depressed,

365
00:39:07,578 --> 00:39:11,105
I take a look at that
and it clears me right up.

366
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:16,579
- This picture makes you feel better?
- Of course.

367
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:21,847
Because you see, Terri,
I thought I was a monster, too.

368
00:39:23,961 --> 00:39:27,397
And believe me when I tell you,
I was treated like one.

369
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:35,066
I like this person.

370
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:40,200
I look forward to these days
and I look forward to my life.

371
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:43,941
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?

372
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:46,640
Mr. Fitzgerald,

373
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:51,277
you were treated like a monster
because you were a monster.

374
00:39:51,355 --> 00:39:53,380
- Wait a second.
- I'm treated like a monster

375
00:39:53,457 --> 00:39:54,981
because that's what I am to them.

376
00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:56,316
- Terri.
- This morning,

377
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,919
they asked me if I suck on my own breasts.

378
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:12,237
Mr. Fitzgerald? Are you okay?

379
00:40:17,848 --> 00:40:19,372
I'm just tired.

380
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:26,451
You know, sometimes I think
I should just leave you kids on your own.

381
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:27,951
The way these other kids treat you,

382
00:40:28,025 --> 00:40:30,926
maybe that's preparation
for the real world.

383
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:39,827
I'm just trying to help you, right?

384
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:46,405
I'm just trying to give you some help, Terri.

385
00:40:49,413 --> 00:40:52,576
I guess I just wish I didn't need help,
you know?

386
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:06,686
Coming at you.

387
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:15,533
So, what about the ditching?

388
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:21,103
Don't worry about it.
I mean, I already yelled at you, right?

389
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:24,739
Am I right?
You were so freaking scared.

390
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:26,373
I wasn't that scared.

391
00:41:26,717 --> 00:41:29,277
Oh, dude, you were scared.

392
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:36,384
Heather Miles
and parent to see you, Mr. Fitzgerald.

393
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:38,988
Thank you, Ms. Hamish.
Just ask them to have a seat, please.

394
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:41,554
We're just about finishing up here.

395
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:44,692
What are you going to do with her?

396
00:41:45,736 --> 00:41:47,363
What can I do?

397
00:41:48,138 --> 00:41:51,835
Ribis is out.
It wouldn't be right if she got to stay on.

398
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,172
Where will she go?

399
00:41:55,379 --> 00:41:59,839
She will transfer to Hollyfield,
I would imagine, like Ribis did.

400
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:02,086
All right, Terri,
we will see you next week, yeah?

401
00:42:02,086 --> 00:42:05,055
All right, Terri,
we will see you next week, yeah?

402
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:15,390
Okay, Heather, Mrs. Miles,
if you could join me here?

403
00:42:18,836 --> 00:42:19,825
Have a seat.

404
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:29,040
Could you tell Mr. Fitzgerald that
I need to see him right away?

405
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:30,874
- What?
- Tell him it's an emergency.

406
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:39,245
Mr. Fitzgerald,
Terri Thompson says he wants to see you.

407
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:41,782
He says it's an emergency.

408
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:49,796
Dude, I have an important conference here.
What is up?

409
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:53,597
- I know, sorry. It's about Heather.
- What about her?

410
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,202
Terri, I'm in the middle of a...

411
00:42:57,274 --> 00:43:01,233
It just seemed to me like Dirty Zach
was making her, you know?

412
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:09,842
That is not what I heard.

413
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:13,484
It's my understanding
she was a willing participant.

414
00:43:14,124 --> 00:43:16,217
Maybe once they got started,
but I saw it from the beginning,

415
00:43:16,293 --> 00:43:19,194
she was shaking her head
and holding him off.

416
00:43:20,497 --> 00:43:23,330
I'm telling you, she didn't want to do it.

417
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,295
You can't kick somebody out of school

418
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:28,998
for something that they didn't want to do,
Mr. Fitzgerald.

419
00:43:31,575 --> 00:43:34,476
Terri, can I ask where this is coming from?

420
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:37,609
This sudden concern?

421
00:43:39,249 --> 00:43:40,238
What do you mean?

422
00:43:44,722 --> 00:43:47,657
All I know is that she didn't want to do it.

423
00:43:47,891 --> 00:43:50,325
That's the truth. No bull.

424
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:56,791
Okay.

425
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:45,239
Chad?

426
00:44:49,987 --> 00:44:53,889
Just wanted to come over
and see what you're doing today, okay?

427
00:44:56,093 --> 00:44:57,117
Oh!

428
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:18,539
- Everything all right?
- Best ever. Thanks, Uncle James.

429
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,453
Yeah, it's great. Thanks.

430
00:45:31,628 --> 00:45:33,255
Where's your mom?

431
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:35,998
I don't know.

432
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,527
Where's your dad?

433
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:41,704
I don't know.

434
00:46:04,294 --> 00:46:06,285
You don't like the beans?

435
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:08,465
I like the beans, Terri.

436
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:18,004
I'm glad you're having a good time.
This is super fun.

437
00:46:22,212 --> 00:46:27,844
I'm Joe Hollywood and I can make you
and I can break you.

438
00:46:28,085 --> 00:46:30,349
So, don't forget to IM me

439
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:35,858
because I'm hemorrhaging money here
and the 101's a freaking parking lot.

440
00:46:38,729 --> 00:46:42,096
The humane thing to do would be to take
the set outside and put it out of its misery.

441
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:44,859
I might have mastered life.

442
00:46:44,935 --> 00:46:48,132
Yeah, baby. Joe Hollywood.

443
00:47:05,088 --> 00:47:07,613
So, what did Fitzgerald
give you for ditching?

444
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:10,058
Uh, he was...

445
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:13,553
He was... He was pretty mad.

446
00:47:13,964 --> 00:47:15,829
Yeah, he was mad. He was mad.

447
00:47:15,899 --> 00:47:17,127
He's a weird dude.

448
00:47:17,201 --> 00:47:19,135
Half the time, I think he wants to hit me,
the other half,

449
00:47:19,203 --> 00:47:21,364
I'm scared he's gonna
kiss me or something.

450
00:47:22,072 --> 00:47:23,164
He wants to help us, Chad.

451
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:25,001
It only creeps me out.

452
00:47:25,475 --> 00:47:28,000
This one time, he shows me
this picture of him as a teenager

453
00:47:28,078 --> 00:47:29,067
with hardly any clothes on.

454
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:32,806
He kept putting his hairy freaking mitts
on my shoulders,

455
00:47:32,883 --> 00:47:34,475
going on about my good heart.

456
00:47:34,551 --> 00:47:36,781
I think it's some straight up weird shit
I don't even want to...

457
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:38,378
He didn't show you Yesterdays.

458
00:47:38,455 --> 00:47:41,219
Yeah, that was it, Yesterdays.

459
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:43,350
"I've never
shown this to anyone before in my life."

460
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:46,122
- Chad, you have to go.
- Why? What's wrong, Terri?

461
00:47:47,331 --> 00:47:49,322
I've got homework to do.
I need to be alone. Please go, Chad.

462
00:47:49,399 --> 00:47:52,630
- It's Sunday. What are you talking about?
- Chad, please just leave me alone.

463
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,261
- Terri, what's wrong?
- Just leave, Chad.

464
00:47:54,338 --> 00:47:56,568
- Whoa! Dude, Terri. Chill out, man. All right.
- You need to go.

465
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,131
Terri, what the hell is the matter with you?

466
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:03,201
What are you? Faggot fucking psycho?

467
00:48:03,413 --> 00:48:04,710
Fucking big-titty piece of shit?

468
00:48:04,781 --> 00:48:06,806
What the fuck's the matter with you?

469
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:14,050
- Where'd your friend go?
- Home, I guess.

470
00:48:15,826 --> 00:48:18,158
I'm glad you're having visitors.

471
00:48:21,164 --> 00:48:21,231
I do understand it.

472
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:22,493
I do understand it.

473
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:24,567
Well, you're underestimating me.

474
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:29,232
Wait. How could you... How... Well, how
could you think that I don't understand it?

475
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:33,841
Because it's got nothing to do
with aesthetics, that's why.

476
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:35,845
No. It's basic mathematics.

477
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:39,849
It has to do with incoming money
and outgoing expenses, Janet.

478
00:48:41,318 --> 00:48:42,307
Hello?

479
00:48:46,657 --> 00:48:49,956
The woman wants to cannonball
into a pool of Italian high-heeled shoes.

480
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:58,894
You tell me something, Terri,
is there anything wrong with my aesthetic?

481
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:05,366
What's up with you, Terri Bear?

482
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,107
Don't call me that.

483
00:49:14,017 --> 00:49:15,143
All right, let's have it.

484
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:17,919
Come on, tell me what's wrong.

485
00:49:17,988 --> 00:49:19,683
Me and Chad Markson
hung out this weekend

486
00:49:19,756 --> 00:49:22,919
and my uncle made us
beans on toast and we talked.

487
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:27,392
Beans on toast?

488
00:49:27,831 --> 00:49:29,423
What, you live in a hobo village?

489
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:32,797
You guys go off on your donkeys after that?

490
00:49:34,371 --> 00:49:36,805
He told me that
you showed him Yesterdays.

491
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:40,843
Oh, I see.

492
00:49:42,913 --> 00:49:44,881
Yeah. "Oh."

493
00:49:49,186 --> 00:49:50,175
Fitzgerald.

494
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:55,981
Where?

495
00:49:58,729 --> 00:50:00,526
The same handwriting?

496
00:50:03,734 --> 00:50:05,827
All right, I'm coming down.

497
00:50:09,072 --> 00:50:10,061
Let's take a walk.

498
00:50:16,172 --> 00:50:17,469
I don't even understand this.

499
00:50:19,075 --> 00:50:21,908
Well, a zombie is someone that's died
and comes back to life.

500
00:50:21,978 --> 00:50:24,139
Yeah, I know what a zombie is, Bob.

501
00:50:28,051 --> 00:50:29,313
I don't see the connection.

502
00:50:34,624 --> 00:50:35,716
Well, go get the paint.

503
00:50:43,299 --> 00:50:44,288
I'm sorry, Terri.

504
00:50:46,369 --> 00:50:48,929
Come sit down over here with me.

505
00:51:05,588 --> 00:51:08,648
Did you notice the new secretary
in my office?

506
00:51:09,192 --> 00:51:13,856
A temp agency sent her over to help out
while Ms. Hamish was in the hospital.

507
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:17,624
Her name is Samantha.
She's a really sweet girl.

508
00:51:18,568 --> 00:51:21,332
She's a newlywed, she lives here in town.

509
00:51:23,106 --> 00:51:24,095
And...

510
00:51:25,708 --> 00:51:27,300
I could tell from the moment she got here

511
00:51:27,376 --> 00:51:30,470
that she really wants
to work here permanently.

512
00:51:31,247 --> 00:51:37,846
I mean, it's a five-minute commute,
very convenient for her, right here in town.

513
00:51:39,288 --> 00:51:41,916
It'd be a great job for her, you know?

514
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:46,421
Anyway, this morning,

515
00:51:46,496 --> 00:51:50,398
she was trying to figure out
through a series of sideways questions

516
00:51:50,466 --> 00:51:53,401
exactly how serious
Ms. Hamish's illness was.

517
00:51:54,537 --> 00:51:57,768
And she was acting concerned, of course,

518
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:02,334
but I could see in her eyes, you know,
she doesn't know Ms. Hamish.

519
00:52:02,411 --> 00:52:04,072
She can't help it.

520
00:52:04,347 --> 00:52:09,512
There's a part of her
that wants Ms. Hamish to die.

521
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:13,285
It'll get her the job.

522
00:52:15,858 --> 00:52:16,882
So?

523
00:52:19,495 --> 00:52:21,429
So, Ms. Hamish is dead, Terri.

524
00:52:22,365 --> 00:52:24,765
I got the call about an hour ago.

525
00:52:26,035 --> 00:52:28,060
I'm sorry, Mr. Fitzgerald.

526
00:52:29,205 --> 00:52:31,901
Don't say things you don't mean, Terri.

527
00:52:32,975 --> 00:52:34,909
You're not sorry she's gone.

528
00:52:35,278 --> 00:52:37,041
You barely knew her.

529
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:38,740
Sorry.

530
00:52:40,716 --> 00:52:42,411
Now, after I got off the phone
with the hospital,

531
00:52:42,485 --> 00:52:45,010
I called the temp agency and I told them,

532
00:52:45,087 --> 00:52:47,487
you know, we're gonna
hire Samantha permanently.

533
00:52:47,557 --> 00:52:50,048
And they thanked me and they said
they'd call her and give her the news.

534
00:52:50,126 --> 00:52:53,391
And I said, "You know, if you don't mind,
I would rather do it,"

535
00:52:53,462 --> 00:52:55,453
because I kind of wanted
to spring the news on her.

536
00:52:55,531 --> 00:53:00,298
You know, what a great way for she and I
to start our working together, right?

537
00:53:01,938 --> 00:53:06,637
But now, I have to tell her she's got the job

538
00:53:08,377 --> 00:53:13,371
and I will have to watch
while she pretends to be sad.

539
00:53:18,754 --> 00:53:20,517
Life's a mess, dude,

540
00:53:23,159 --> 00:53:26,720
but we're all just doing
the best we can, you know.

541
00:53:27,597 --> 00:53:30,930
You, and me, and Samantha,

542
00:53:34,070 --> 00:53:36,265
we're just doing what we can.

543
00:53:38,174 --> 00:53:43,339
So, if I hurt you or if I lied to you,
all I can tell you is I'm sorry,

544
00:53:45,214 --> 00:53:47,341
and I will try to do better.

545
00:53:49,485 --> 00:53:54,548
Maybe I will do better
or maybe I'll do even worse. I don't know.

546
00:53:56,158 --> 00:54:00,618
I screw up all the time
because that's what people do,

547
00:54:02,999 --> 00:54:04,125
you know?

548
00:54:07,803 --> 00:54:09,168
Okay, Mr. Fitzgerald.

549
00:54:12,375 --> 00:54:14,900
Ms. Hamish's funeral is this Friday.

550
00:54:16,312 --> 00:54:20,373
She doesn't have any family
or even any friends.

551
00:54:20,483 --> 00:54:24,112
I was going to go over there alone
and pay my respects,

552
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:28,953
but I got to be honest,
it is starting to feel like a real downer.

553
00:54:30,326 --> 00:54:32,692
I just don't know. Uh...

554
00:54:35,931 --> 00:54:37,922
Do you want to come with?

555
00:54:47,943 --> 00:54:50,241
You can come sit
over here with us, Terri.

556
00:54:50,313 --> 00:54:51,302
I'm okay. Thanks.

557
00:54:53,816 --> 00:54:55,044
What a jerk!

558
00:55:03,125 --> 00:55:05,855
Enough, people, enough.

559
00:55:07,963 --> 00:55:11,126
This is something that we're going
to have to get through together,

560
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,326
as a group.

561
00:55:14,904 --> 00:55:19,705
Now, there will be a test this Friday

562
00:55:21,143 --> 00:55:25,102
where you will be asked to showcase
your mucho sewing skills

563
00:55:25,181 --> 00:55:27,843
with a traditional Mexican poncho.

564
00:55:33,956 --> 00:55:35,856
Take them off, Heather.

565
00:55:37,593 --> 00:55:41,154
Take the sunglasses off, Heather Miles.

566
00:55:41,297 --> 00:55:42,992
Take them off, Heather! God!

567
00:55:50,072 --> 00:55:52,836
Hey, everybody, look at me,
I'm Joe Hollywood.

568
00:55:52,908 --> 00:55:57,436
I am successful. You should come
because I'm going to help you out.

569
00:55:57,546 --> 00:56:01,175
I'm hemorrhaging.
I'm on a parking lot.

570
00:56:01,350 --> 00:56:03,284
Oh, Joe Hollywood.

571
00:56:03,586 --> 00:56:04,985
Very nice, Terri.

572
00:56:09,859 --> 00:56:12,054
Would you mind
if we continue with the lesson?

573
00:56:12,261 --> 00:56:13,455
I'm sorry, Ms. Vick.

574
00:56:21,704 --> 00:56:25,037
Now, the traditional
Mexican poncho

575
00:56:26,542 --> 00:56:29,340
is centuries and centuries old.

576
00:56:29,645 --> 00:56:34,947
And what makes it extraordinary
is the individuality of all the design,

577
00:56:35,017 --> 00:56:36,951
and that's where you all come in.

578
00:56:37,319 --> 00:56:42,313
Each one of you is going to leave
indelibly your own imprint.

579
00:56:43,225 --> 00:56:48,822
The traditional Mexican costume
is exquisite.

580
00:56:49,565 --> 00:56:54,229
And because they do not have
the kind of industrialization that we have,

581
00:56:54,336 --> 00:56:56,201
they've been able to maintain

582
00:56:56,705 --> 00:57:02,075
this ancient and traditional
culture and dress.

583
00:57:03,045 --> 00:57:05,309
You're all capable
of going on the computer.

584
00:57:05,381 --> 00:57:10,546
I want you all to look and decide
where is your particular poncho from.

585
00:57:11,086 --> 00:57:13,486
Think about what towns,

586
00:57:13,556 --> 00:57:16,525
is it going to be Minatitlán?
Is it going to be Oaxaca?

587
00:57:16,659 --> 00:57:19,321
Is it going to be San Miguel de Allende?

588
00:57:20,996 --> 00:57:24,295
What have we got?
We've got yarn. Look at those colors.

589
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:27,594
And the Mexican flag.
Look how brilliant that flag is.

590
00:57:27,937 --> 00:57:33,170
I want you to incorporate these
with bright, basic colors into your ponchos.

591
00:57:34,243 --> 00:57:35,904
And for people that are shy,

592
00:57:35,978 --> 00:57:39,846
this will be excellent to start coming out
and wear bright colors

593
00:57:39,949 --> 00:57:42,577
and say to the world,
"Here I am. This is me."

594
00:57:52,361 --> 00:57:53,692
Bye, guys.

595
00:57:58,868 --> 00:58:00,597
Oh, my God, that was so funny.

596
00:58:02,338 --> 00:58:03,327
Bye, Heather.

597
00:58:14,650 --> 00:58:16,345
Hey, hold on a minute?

598
00:58:21,257 --> 00:58:24,420
Um, hi. Do you have a second?

599
00:58:25,127 --> 00:58:26,151
Yeah, sure.

600
00:58:27,663 --> 00:58:30,826
I guess I just wanted to say thank you

601
00:58:32,067 --> 00:58:34,558
for doing that thing in there,
with the sunglasses.

602
00:58:35,771 --> 00:58:37,238
Okay, yeah.

603
00:58:39,074 --> 00:58:41,133
Can I ask you something, though?

604
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:47,171
I mean, why did you help me?

605
00:58:49,652 --> 00:58:51,142
I'm... I don't know, why not?

606
00:58:54,089 --> 00:58:55,181
I don't know.

607
00:58:57,226 --> 00:59:02,095
Since last week, it seems like
everyone has decided to hate me

608
00:59:02,798 --> 00:59:03,856
except for you.

609
00:59:07,403 --> 00:59:09,462
Do you know what I think it is, Heather?

610
00:59:12,841 --> 00:59:17,210
I think that there's good-heart kids
and that there is bad-heart kids

611
00:59:17,279 --> 00:59:18,268
here at the school.

612
00:59:19,648 --> 00:59:23,311
But when I look at you,
when I really look at you,

613
00:59:23,385 --> 00:59:27,822
I know that you're a good-heart person.

614
00:59:30,392 --> 00:59:31,518
And I guess that

615
00:59:33,395 --> 00:59:38,526
makes me want to help you
or be nice to you or...

616
00:59:38,601 --> 00:59:43,698
Because that's what good hearts get.

617
00:59:43,772 --> 00:59:45,137
I don't know.

618
00:59:46,308 --> 00:59:48,276
Well, thank you, Terri.

619
00:59:50,779 --> 00:59:51,768
I'll see you tomorrow.

620
00:59:53,749 --> 00:59:54,738
Bye, Heather.

621
01:01:07,790 --> 01:01:08,848
Hi, Chad.

622
01:02:43,886 --> 01:02:48,346
Terri Thompson, the man with the plan.
Terri T, super kid.

623
01:02:49,892 --> 01:02:52,622
- Hi, Samantha.
- Terri! Terri!

624
01:02:54,696 --> 01:02:57,392
Terri Thompson's here to see you.

625
01:02:57,499 --> 01:02:58,488
Yeah, just one second.

626
01:03:09,144 --> 01:03:12,045
Look, I'm sorry I freaked out on you, okay?

627
01:03:16,218 --> 01:03:17,276
Why?

628
01:03:19,922 --> 01:03:22,823
Why'd I freak out on you,
or why am I sorry?

629
01:03:24,626 --> 01:03:25,615
Why?

630
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:33,089
Okay.

631
01:03:34,303 --> 01:03:38,433
I freaked out on you because
you made me feel bad about Mr. Fitzgerald.

632
01:03:40,342 --> 01:03:44,836
And I don't want to feel bad about him
because he's my good friend.

633
01:03:44,913 --> 01:03:48,349
- And you can think I'm...
- All right. Who is ready to mourn?

634
01:03:51,987 --> 01:03:55,320
Samantha, why wasn't Chad told
that his Friday meeting was canceled?

635
01:03:56,458 --> 01:03:59,188
Um... Right. Just... One second.

636
01:03:59,595 --> 01:04:03,429
I'm sorry about this, Chad, but you must
have heard about Mrs. Hamish's passing.

637
01:04:03,565 --> 01:04:07,262
Well, Terri and I are just going
to the funeral to see her off, so...

638
01:04:08,503 --> 01:04:09,492
Yeah.

639
01:04:10,105 --> 01:04:12,539
We'll make it up next week.
We'll do Thursday and Friday.

640
01:04:12,608 --> 01:04:15,406
- How about that?
- Mr. Fitzgerald, could Chad come with us?

641
01:04:16,478 --> 01:04:19,038
I was just going to say the same thing.

642
01:04:19,948 --> 01:04:20,937
To the funeral?

643
01:04:22,117 --> 01:04:23,550
You know, I really liked Ms. Hamish.

644
01:04:24,152 --> 01:04:26,484
She was... She was my friend.

645
01:04:29,491 --> 01:04:30,480
Yeah.

646
01:04:31,660 --> 01:04:33,355
I don't know, Chad...

647
01:04:33,428 --> 01:04:36,454
Yeah? I can go?
I'm really going to miss her.

648
01:04:37,766 --> 01:04:41,827
I'm going to need you to cut out
any kind of weirdness there, Chad.

649
01:04:41,970 --> 01:04:43,062
Can I have your word on that?

650
01:04:43,238 --> 01:04:44,637
Oh, yeah. Totally.

651
01:04:45,207 --> 01:04:46,799
All right, boys.

652
01:04:50,679 --> 01:04:52,044
What? What?

653
01:04:53,348 --> 01:04:56,374
Please write down the schedule,
Thursday and Friday.

654
01:05:00,055 --> 01:05:01,852
Terri, check out her skull.

655
01:05:03,725 --> 01:05:05,659
Gracias. Thank you.

656
01:05:21,410 --> 01:05:23,935
Please don't make me laugh.

657
01:05:24,046 --> 01:05:26,571
Boys, have some respect.

658
01:05:27,549 --> 01:05:29,949
There's a dead person right here.

659
01:05:33,355 --> 01:05:36,483
- We're just... This is us.
- Sure.

660
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:39,759
All righty.

661
01:05:43,365 --> 01:05:44,889
Please. Please.

662
01:06:11,126 --> 01:06:12,115
Amen.

663
01:06:20,202 --> 01:06:21,191
Amen.

664
01:06:22,971 --> 01:06:24,165
Um...

665
01:06:53,268 --> 01:06:57,500
No baked beans in this whole place,
if you can believe it or not.

666
01:07:02,577 --> 01:07:04,807
I just never know what to get.

667
01:07:08,683 --> 01:07:10,480
What are you getting?

668
01:07:12,788 --> 01:07:14,221
Are you guys ready to order?

669
01:07:14,289 --> 01:07:17,087
You know, we're going to
need another minute, if that's all right.

670
01:07:17,159 --> 01:07:18,148
Of course.

671
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:29,502
Hey, that reminds me.
What's up with you and that girl Heather?

672
01:07:30,405 --> 01:07:34,205
- Oh! Did you see that?
- That did look like something, yeah.

673
01:07:34,876 --> 01:07:36,707
Nothing. We've just been talking.

674
01:07:38,246 --> 01:07:39,804
She's coming over tonight.

675
01:07:40,115 --> 01:07:43,243
Wait, like, tonight? As in tonight, tonight?

676
01:07:44,119 --> 01:07:46,212
- 7:00, she said.
- And it's a date?

677
01:07:47,389 --> 01:07:50,483
- She didn't say.
- What are you guys going to do?

678
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:53,227
I don't know.

679
01:07:54,696 --> 01:07:59,224
I guess I'II... I'm going to show her around
and I'll show her my paperbacks,

680
01:07:59,301 --> 01:08:02,702
and introduce her to Uncle James.

681
01:08:02,771 --> 01:08:06,468
And he's got some old records
and I think she likes music, so...

682
01:08:07,709 --> 01:08:09,870
Is your heart breaking right now?

683
01:08:10,245 --> 01:08:11,644
Mine is.

684
01:08:13,815 --> 01:08:14,907
All right, Terri, no offense,

685
01:08:14,983 --> 01:08:16,610
but it's time to take your head
out of your ass, okay?

686
01:08:16,685 --> 01:08:18,277
Chad, watch it.

687
01:08:18,753 --> 01:08:20,653
Sorry, Mr. Fitzgerald.

688
01:08:20,722 --> 01:08:23,885
You have the biggest set of tits
in the entire school, besides yours,

689
01:08:23,959 --> 01:08:25,517
- coming to your house tonight.
- Chad.

690
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:29,254
She says she just wants to come over
and see where I live.

691
01:08:29,464 --> 01:08:31,091
Oh, you're going to blow it.

692
01:08:31,433 --> 01:08:33,731
If you do, she won't. Get it?

693
01:08:36,338 --> 01:08:39,136
What is wrong with you, Chad? Honestly.

694
01:08:42,177 --> 01:08:44,611
- Right here. Stop.
- Okay.

695
01:08:51,653 --> 01:08:55,214
Listen, Ter,
thanks for tagging along today, Ter.

696
01:08:56,858 --> 01:08:59,486
It was weird.

697
01:09:00,428 --> 01:09:03,124
- It was really weird.
- It was awesome.

698
01:09:04,399 --> 01:09:07,368
And good luck tonight, Terri.
You look out for yourself, okay?

699
01:09:08,103 --> 01:09:10,230
Thanks, Mr. Fitzgerald. Bye.

700
01:09:17,779 --> 01:09:19,644
Don't touch the radio.

701
01:09:45,740 --> 01:09:47,537
What's with the face?

702
01:09:48,343 --> 01:09:49,469
Someone steal your crackers?

703
01:09:51,213 --> 01:09:52,578
Are you...

704
01:09:54,583 --> 01:09:55,572
You look pretty good.

705
01:09:57,018 --> 01:09:59,043
No rhyme or reason to it.

706
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:02,578
I don't want to be rude, but I want
to take advantage of this window,

707
01:10:02,657 --> 01:10:04,454
if you don't mind.

708
01:10:04,526 --> 01:10:05,515
Yeah, sure.

709
01:10:06,561 --> 01:10:08,893
I'm going to go clean for a bit.

710
01:12:04,312 --> 01:12:05,301
Oh.

711
01:12:06,214 --> 01:12:07,272
Hey, Terri.

712
01:12:07,482 --> 01:12:08,506
How's it going?

713
01:12:08,583 --> 01:12:09,641
What are you doing here, Chad?

714
01:12:09,984 --> 01:12:13,215
Look, I don't want
to break up a party or anything.

715
01:12:14,422 --> 01:12:15,446
Is she here?

716
01:12:15,523 --> 01:12:18,253
No, but she's going to be here any minute,
and I just put Uncle James down.

717
01:12:18,426 --> 01:12:21,520
- Are you gonna get out of here or what?
- Yeah, totally.

718
01:12:21,930 --> 01:12:23,158
Listen, though.

719
01:12:26,468 --> 01:12:27,628
Can I use your restroom real quick?

720
01:12:28,203 --> 01:12:31,297
No. Go pee in the woods. I'll see you
tomorrow and I'll tell you all about it.

721
01:12:33,041 --> 01:12:36,067
I'm afraid it's a little more serious
than that, Terri.

722
01:12:38,079 --> 01:12:39,205
Are you almost done in there?

723
01:12:40,048 --> 01:12:43,484
What? Who is it?

724
01:12:45,453 --> 01:12:47,717
Terri? Terri Thompson?

725
01:12:48,623 --> 01:12:52,320
I never liked you, Terri.
Why are you so mean?

726
01:12:56,464 --> 01:12:59,524
Delivery!

727
01:12:59,601 --> 01:13:02,866
Delivery, Terri.

728
01:13:08,510 --> 01:13:09,636
Ooh!

729
01:13:12,914 --> 01:13:14,245
Hi, Terri.

730
01:13:17,485 --> 01:13:19,476
Terri?

731
01:13:28,930 --> 01:13:30,022
Um...

732
01:13:30,999 --> 01:13:32,728
Is that your uncle?

733
01:13:33,735 --> 01:13:36,636
It's my friend Chad.
He'll be gone in a minute.

734
01:13:38,406 --> 01:13:39,998
Terri.

735
01:13:40,842 --> 01:13:43,333
What's wrong with him?

736
01:13:43,411 --> 01:13:45,709
A few different things, I think.

737
01:14:00,195 --> 01:14:02,789
Have you been drinking alcohol, Chad?

738
01:14:03,665 --> 01:14:05,132
A little bit.

739
01:14:11,906 --> 01:14:17,037
If you honestly think that I'm going to kill
the buzz of a $200 bottle of whiskey.

740
01:14:17,111 --> 01:14:21,138
$200 for one bottle?

741
01:14:21,216 --> 01:14:25,312
- It's not $200, Chad.
- It is so and it is fucking delicious.

742
01:14:26,988 --> 01:14:28,455
You want... You want me to go get it?

743
01:14:32,227 --> 01:14:35,094
I don't want any, Heather,
but if you do, you should go ahead.

744
01:14:38,566 --> 01:14:41,558
Yeah? I should go? I'm going to find it.

745
01:14:45,974 --> 01:14:47,032
Never mind, Chad.

746
01:14:53,414 --> 01:14:57,009
You know, he's probably
not going to find it anyways.

747
01:15:01,089 --> 01:15:03,421
Hey, do you want to go see your uncle?

748
01:15:11,933 --> 01:15:13,867
Can he hear us?

749
01:15:14,202 --> 01:15:15,669
I'm not sure.

750
01:15:17,572 --> 01:15:21,736
Anyways, even if he could hear us,
he wouldn't remember it later on.

751
01:15:25,113 --> 01:15:26,580
He looks sad.

752
01:15:36,024 --> 01:15:39,482
Maybe he can hear us,
but he just doesn't care.

753
01:15:45,567 --> 01:15:46,556
What are you doing?

754
01:16:01,316 --> 01:16:06,344
There's no use in pretending
you're thinking of anybody but yourself.

755
01:16:16,464 --> 01:16:17,453
Why do you say that?

756
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:20,429
Heather, he's sick.

757
01:16:21,970 --> 01:16:24,200
Does he talk to you like that?

758
01:16:28,710 --> 01:16:29,734
No.

759
01:16:33,548 --> 01:16:34,947
Last one to puke is a rotten egg.

760
01:16:38,753 --> 01:16:39,845
Hmm.

761
01:16:43,124 --> 01:16:45,319
Meet you in the shed then, fuckers.

762
01:16:48,763 --> 01:16:52,722
Come on. Let's let him rest.
You can go have a drink with Chad.

763
01:17:03,678 --> 01:17:05,339
I propose a toast,

764
01:17:08,082 --> 01:17:10,277
to good times and friends.

765
01:17:16,224 --> 01:17:18,192
That's not how you're supposed
to drink it, Terri.

766
01:17:18,292 --> 01:17:20,590
- It's how I drink it, okay?
- Wait a minute.

767
01:17:20,662 --> 01:17:23,028
Shut up and listen, you guys.

768
01:17:23,097 --> 01:17:26,066
Sounds like... Like...

769
01:17:30,938 --> 01:17:34,533
Hey, give me that. They're not yours.

770
01:17:34,676 --> 01:17:35,665
Hey!

771
01:17:38,479 --> 01:17:39,537
What the hell was that?

772
01:17:39,614 --> 01:17:42,947
- Chad, they're my uncle's.
- Your uncle has a whole houseful, okay?

773
01:17:43,451 --> 01:17:46,079
He's not going to notice
three little pills missing.

774
01:17:53,294 --> 01:17:55,262
I don't think we should.

775
01:17:55,963 --> 01:17:56,952
Well...

776
01:18:02,537 --> 01:18:04,027
Think she'll fuck us both?
Yes or no?

777
01:18:04,105 --> 01:18:06,539
What? What?

778
01:18:07,075 --> 01:18:10,772
- I know you met her first, Terri.
- Chad, I want you to take it easy, okay?

779
01:18:11,179 --> 01:18:12,976
No, I'm pretty sure that...

780
01:18:13,781 --> 01:18:16,443
Do we really need the radio right now?

781
01:18:16,517 --> 01:18:18,041
Look, look at me.

782
01:18:18,953 --> 01:18:23,720
I need you to take a breath and calm down.
Look at me. Calm down, okay?

783
01:18:23,791 --> 01:18:25,418
I'm totally calm.

784
01:18:26,994 --> 01:18:29,519
Look, pay attention
next time I'm over there

785
01:18:29,597 --> 01:18:32,225
because she's looking at me
like I'm up for auction.

786
01:18:32,300 --> 01:18:35,098
Maybe we can just deal without the radio.

787
01:18:38,406 --> 01:18:42,274
I don't want you to be uncomfortable,
but I think it would be okay

788
01:18:42,343 --> 01:18:44,368
if we just took one each.

789
01:18:44,445 --> 01:18:46,413
Fuck, yeah. Let's do it.

790
01:18:49,183 --> 01:18:52,175
- What's it going to do to me?
- Just make you feel nice.

791
01:18:53,287 --> 01:18:54,447
I already feel nice.

792
01:18:55,189 --> 01:18:57,214
You can always feel nicer.

793
01:18:58,993 --> 01:19:00,017
Only one, though, right?

794
01:19:00,361 --> 01:19:01,623
Only one.

795
01:19:22,884 --> 01:19:23,873
You took two pills.

796
01:19:27,155 --> 01:19:28,247
Shh!

797
01:19:28,322 --> 01:19:29,949
Don't tell Terri.

798
01:19:30,892 --> 01:19:32,883
Who cares about that guy?

799
01:19:33,494 --> 01:19:36,725
I care. He's my great big sweetheart.

800
01:19:36,964 --> 01:19:37,565
Hey.

801
01:19:37,565 --> 01:19:37,963
Hey.

802
01:19:38,733 --> 01:19:39,859
Uh...

803
01:19:40,768 --> 01:19:45,102
Heather, I have a question.

804
01:19:45,706 --> 01:19:46,798
Um...

805
01:19:48,676 --> 01:19:50,871
- Why did you get fingered that one time?
- Chad!

806
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:54,248
- Come on.
- I'm sorry, Heather.

807
01:19:54,916 --> 01:19:57,248
You don't have to answer that
if you don't want to.

808
01:19:59,287 --> 01:20:00,879
I'll answer it.

809
01:20:06,627 --> 01:20:08,822
Oh, good.

810
01:20:34,355 --> 01:20:40,453
All girls get fingered sooner or later, Chad,
but I guess you wouldn't know about that.

811
01:20:42,363 --> 01:20:43,694
Yeah. That's nice.

812
01:20:43,764 --> 01:20:46,528
Look, what I was trying to get at is,

813
01:20:46,601 --> 01:20:49,832
why did you get fingered
in Home Economics?

814
01:20:52,673 --> 01:20:55,005
That's where he wanted to do it.

815
01:20:57,278 --> 01:20:59,269
He said nobody would see.

816
01:21:01,849 --> 01:21:03,578
But why Dirty Zach?

817
01:21:05,019 --> 01:21:08,682
Because he wanted to, okay?

818
01:21:10,825 --> 01:21:13,589
And it feels good to be wanted.

819
01:21:16,697 --> 01:21:19,131
Maybe that sounds sad to you guys.

820
01:21:20,801 --> 01:21:22,268
I don't know.

821
01:21:32,613 --> 01:21:35,104
No, it's not sad.

822
01:21:36,484 --> 01:21:38,247
It's not sad at all.

823
01:22:12,820 --> 01:22:15,288
- I feel strange.
- I feel awesome!

824
01:22:18,059 --> 01:22:21,790
It's probably just the pill, Terri.
Is it too strong? Are you okay?

825
01:22:24,598 --> 01:22:26,031
You look like an adult over there.

826
01:22:27,768 --> 01:22:30,100
- I do?
- Like a big shot.

827
01:22:33,674 --> 01:22:35,266
You're so shiny.

828
01:22:37,011 --> 01:22:38,000
I am?

829
01:22:39,947 --> 01:22:40,936
I'm shiny?

830
01:22:41,148 --> 01:22:43,844
I just want to
fuck the whole world.

831
01:22:44,018 --> 01:22:46,282
Cut a hole in the ground,
I'll fuck it all night.

832
01:22:52,126 --> 01:22:54,924
It feels like I peed my pants, but I didn't.

833
01:22:55,162 --> 01:22:57,062
Me, too.

834
01:22:57,932 --> 01:23:00,264
Hey, let's pee our pants on purpose, huh?

835
01:23:00,501 --> 01:23:01,593
What?

836
01:23:03,437 --> 01:23:04,836
Go for it, Chad.

837
01:23:04,939 --> 01:23:05,963
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

838
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:08,770
- You don't think I'll do it?
- I hope you do.

839
01:23:09,543 --> 01:23:12,637
- I'm doing it, doing it right now.
- Okay.

840
01:23:47,782 --> 01:23:49,875
What did you think of that?

841
01:23:53,387 --> 01:23:54,615
Chad, that was amazing.

842
01:23:58,659 --> 01:24:00,889
What did you think about that?

843
01:24:02,096 --> 01:24:05,998
- Well, it was new.
- Yeah?

844
01:24:07,168 --> 01:24:08,192
Your turn.

845
01:24:08,269 --> 01:24:12,433
My turn to what, pee all over my clothes?
No, thank you.

846
01:24:13,274 --> 01:24:15,242
You got to do something.

847
01:24:15,743 --> 01:24:18,211
I mean, I didn't just do all that for nothing.

848
01:24:19,013 --> 01:24:21,072
I think you did, actually.

849
01:24:22,083 --> 01:24:24,176
Chad, what are you talking about?

850
01:24:24,251 --> 01:24:26,719
You have to do something, Heather.

851
01:24:28,422 --> 01:24:31,186
Gee, Chad, what do you want me to do?

852
01:24:33,861 --> 01:24:35,419
Yeah, that's right.

853
01:24:37,264 --> 01:24:40,791
I want you to suck my cock.

854
01:24:53,414 --> 01:24:54,403
Cock?

855
01:24:56,450 --> 01:25:01,012
You call that little pink thing
stuck to your balls a cock?

856
01:25:17,938 --> 01:25:19,269
Fuck this.

857
01:25:36,490 --> 01:25:37,650
Terri.

858
01:25:41,362 --> 01:25:42,829
Fucking hell!

859
01:26:11,192 --> 01:26:12,523
Hey, guys.

860
01:26:33,214 --> 01:26:35,512
You're not drinking your drink.

861
01:26:38,385 --> 01:26:41,912
You're supposed to hit it, not babysit it.

862
01:27:01,742 --> 01:27:03,869
What are you thinking about?

863
01:27:05,913 --> 01:27:07,938
He wants to see your tits.

864
01:27:25,532 --> 01:27:27,261
Do you want to see?

865
01:27:29,436 --> 01:27:30,425
I don't know.

866
01:27:31,972 --> 01:27:32,961
No, no.

867
01:27:34,675 --> 01:27:38,008
She wants to see your tits.

868
01:27:39,313 --> 01:27:41,008
Show her your tits, Terri.

869
01:28:10,611 --> 01:28:13,045
- Let's take our clothes off.
- I can't.

870
01:28:14,581 --> 01:28:15,912
I'll help.

871
01:29:13,741 --> 01:29:14,901
Terri.

872
01:29:16,410 --> 01:29:17,502
Look.

873
01:29:30,724 --> 01:29:32,351
Terri, come here.

874
01:29:44,371 --> 01:29:48,432
Terri, come over here. Come on.

875
01:29:51,278 --> 01:29:52,472
Terri.

876
01:30:03,657 --> 01:30:07,024
Terri, please come over here.
I'm right here, please.

877
01:30:10,297 --> 01:30:11,457
Terri.

878
01:30:14,835 --> 01:30:15,995
Terri.

879
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:29,393
Did you have somebody
over here last night?

880
01:33:30,297 --> 01:33:31,491
A girl?

881
01:33:33,300 --> 01:33:34,426
Yeah.

882
01:33:35,068 --> 01:33:36,558
A pretty girl.

883
01:34:46,039 --> 01:34:48,507
Who... Was... What happened?

884
01:34:58,251 --> 01:34:59,479
Come on.

885
01:35:11,598 --> 01:35:13,190
Thank you, Terri.

886
01:35:13,834 --> 01:35:16,769
There's some aspirin in the nurse's station.

887
01:35:17,571 --> 01:35:19,562
Yeah, that would be good.

888
01:35:31,618 --> 01:35:34,849
Well, that was easy.
What the hell is this lock for anyway?

889
01:35:35,155 --> 01:35:36,554
Aspirin and iodine?

890
01:35:39,860 --> 01:35:41,452
Can I have one, too?

891
01:36:09,389 --> 01:36:10,856
Sky hoop.

892
01:36:13,326 --> 01:36:14,486
Sky hoop.

893
01:36:30,644 --> 01:36:32,305
What do you think?

894
01:36:35,081 --> 01:36:36,742
She's embarrassed.

895
01:36:39,319 --> 01:36:40,809
I'm not going to say anything
about what happened

896
01:36:40,887 --> 01:36:43,378
if that's what she's worried about.

897
01:36:43,657 --> 01:36:46,455
Well, I'm sure she would appreciate that.

898
01:36:57,537 --> 01:36:58,868
It's okay.

899
01:37:00,307 --> 01:37:02,673
I don't think I'm ready
for all that stuff yet anyway.

900
01:37:04,511 --> 01:37:07,480
Who is, you know?

901
01:37:20,460 --> 01:37:24,419
So, do you think you and your wife
are going to get divorced?

902
01:37:25,732 --> 01:37:27,723
No. No.

903
01:37:29,836 --> 01:37:31,303
Just a fight.

904
01:37:33,073 --> 01:37:34,734
One of many.

905
01:37:40,113 --> 01:37:41,774
What was it about?

906
01:37:44,751 --> 01:37:48,551
For some people, Terri,
enough is just not enough.

907
01:38:01,434 --> 01:38:02,924
How do I look?

908
01:38:04,471 --> 01:38:06,439
Like you slept in a car.

909
01:38:07,207 --> 01:38:08,231
Oh, well.

910
01:38:08,675 --> 01:38:10,802
Are you going to go home now?

911
01:38:10,877 --> 01:38:15,314
Yeah. I might as well get it over with.
Where are you gonna go?

912
01:38:15,382 --> 01:38:17,873
I'll probably see how Chad's doing.

913
01:38:18,919 --> 01:38:23,253
Listen, Terri,
we did not just enter school property.

914
01:38:25,125 --> 01:38:26,114
- Okay.
- Yeah?

915
01:38:26,192 --> 01:38:28,922
- Are we clear on that?
- Very clear.

916
01:38:28,995 --> 01:38:30,326
All right. Lay five on me.

917
01:38:40,974 --> 01:38:42,942
Come on, lay five on me.

918
01:38:44,678 --> 01:38:47,670
I will see you on Monday
for our meeting, yeah?

919
01:38:47,914 --> 01:38:49,279
- Monday.
- All right.

920
01:38:53,987 --> 01:38:55,716
Thank you.
