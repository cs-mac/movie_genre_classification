THE FACTS.

320
00:26:29,865 --> 00:26:33,183
A FOREIGNER COMES TO
MY COUNTRY, TAKES A GIRL TO BED
AFTER KNOWING HER A FEW HOURS,

321
00:26:33,418 --> 00:26:35,119

MUCH LIQUOR.

322
00:26:35,186 --> 00:26:37,221
NEXT MORNING
SHE IS DEAD.

323
00:26:37,289 --> 00:26:39,756
THE FOREIGNER SAYS
HE IS INNOCENT.
I AM.

324
00:26:39,824 --> 00:26:42,559
HIS HANDS ARE COVERED
WITH HER BLOOD,
AND HIS FINGERPRINTS...

325
00:26:42,627 --> 00:26:46,196
ARE ALL OVER
THE MURDER WEAPON.

326
00:26:46,431 --> 00:26:51,302
WITH A GUILTY PLEA, THE COURT
MAY BE PERSUADED BY MY ARGUMENTS

I WAS NOT INSANE.
I'M NOT PLEADING GUILTY.

329
00:26:57,442 --> 00:26:59,376

THE JUDGE...

330
00:26:59,444 --> 00:27:03,013
AND THE TWO MEMBERS OF
THE PUBLIC SITTING NEXT TO HER,
CALLED "PEOPLE'S ASSESSORS,"

331

334
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:16,026
MORAL EDUCATION OF CRIMINALS
IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE.

335
00:27:16,094 --> 00:27:18,728

TO THOSE WHO CONFESS.

ON THEIR INNOCENCE.

338
00:27:23,034 --> 00:27:25,936

WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY.
YES.

1163
01:45:13,389 --> 01:45:18,760
WOULD IT BE ACCURATE TO SAY
THAT MY OWN COMPANY,
McANDREWS COMMUNICATIONS,

1164
01:45:18,828 --> 01:45:21,262
WAS HOFFCO TELEKOMM'S

LET ME REPHRASE.
LIN DAN,

1170
01:45:38,681 --> 01:45:41,783
McANDREWS COMMUNICATIONS
DID NOT OFFER YOU
AN EQUIVALENT POSITION.

1171
01:45:41,851 --> 01:45:46,521
THAT HAD NOT BEEN DISCUSSED.
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH HONG LING'S MURDER.

IT HAS EVERYTHING TO DO

[Chinese]
[Male Interpreter]
WHY DOES THE COURT PERMIT THIS ?

1176
01:45:55,865 --> 01:45:59,334

YOU USED HER
AND YOU SACRIFICED HER--

1177
01:45:59,401 --> 01:46:02,237
TO SABOTAGE THE DEAL
YOUR FATHER WAS COMPLETING
WITH McANDREWS.

1178
01:46:02,304 --> 01:46:05,040
WITH WHOM HE HAD A LONG
PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP.  IT
COULD'VE LEFT YOU IN THE COLD.

1179
01:46:05,108 --> 01:46:07,142
THESE ARE NOT QUESTIONS.

1180
01:46:07,210 --> 01:46:11,412
BUT THIS IS.
WHAT WAS THE NATURE OF YOUR
RELATIONSHIP WITH HONG LING ?

1181
01:46:11,480 --> 01:46:13,749
I HAD NO RELATIONSHIP
WITH HONG LING.

1182
01:46:13,816 --> 01:46:16,985
NONE AT ALL ?

1183
01:46:17,053 --> 01:46:19,054
WOULD YOU LIKE TO RECONSIDER
THAT STATEMENT ?

1184
01:46:19,122 --> 01:46:23,424
I KNEW HER, KNEW OF HER FAMILY.
BUT THERE WAS NO RELATIONSHIP.

1185
01:46:23,492 --> 01:46:26,728
NO RELATIONSHIP.
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THIS ?

1186
01:46:29,665 --> 01:46:32,033
THIS IS HONG LING'S LOCKET.

1187
01:46:32,101 --> 01:46:35,670
SHE WORE IT
THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER.
JUST TURNED UP.

1188
01:46:40,342 --> 01:46:44,112
INSIDE IS A PICTURE

A PHOTOGRAPH OF YOU AND
HONG LING INSIDE HER LOCKET ?

1200
01:47:20,382 --> 01:47:22,818
THERE WAS NO RELATIONSHIP.

1201

ON THE NIGHT HONG LING
WAS KILLED,

1208
01:47:44,207 --> 01:47:46,641
THREE CALLS WERE MADE
FROM THIS NUMBER.

1209

- TWO CALLS WERE RECEIVED.

THE FIRST CALL RECEIVED
WAS FROM HONG LING
EARLY THAT NIGHT.

1211

THEN LATER,

<i>A CALL WAS MADE

AT 5:46 A.M.,

1217
01:48:12,835 --> 01:48:16,637
A TWO-MINUTE CALL
WAS MADE FROM THIS NUMBER
TO POLICE HEADQUARTERS.

1218
01:48:16,705 --> 01:48:20,375
[Interpreters]
- THIS IS CHAOS
- I WILL HAVE YOU REMOVED.

1219

I DO.

1221
01:48:25,714 --> 01:48:27,949
CAN YOU GIVE THE COURT
THE NUMBER OF THAT PHONE ?

1222
01:48:28,017 --> 01:48:31,719
I AM NOT A SECRETARY,
AND I RARELY CALL MYSELF,
SO I WOULD NEED TO CHECK IT.

1223
01:48:31,787 --> 01:48:35,690
IS THE NUMBER OF YOUR

1224
01:48:35,758 --> 01:48:37,325
NO, IT IS NOT.

1225

YOU'RE QUITE SURE ?
EVEN THOUGH YOU RARELY
CALL YOURSELF ?

YES, I AM QUITE SURE.

1227

HAS THAT NUMBER ?
5-1-7-8-5-7.

1228

IS THE TELEPHONE NUMBER YOURS,

WHY ARE YOU AFRAID ?

1233
01:49:20,101 --> 01:49:23,804
YOU USED YOUR FATHER'S PHONE
'CAUSE YOU KNEW THE RECORDS
OF AN OFFICIAL CAN BE WITHHELD.

1234
01:49:23,872 --> 01:49:26,740

TO SET ME UP IN SOME WAY,
WASN'T SHE ?

DRUGGED ME WITH CHLOROFORM.
