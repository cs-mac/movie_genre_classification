1
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:12,765
I'm truly sorry,

2
00:00:12,829 --> 00:00:15,765
but it's just that this is a really important opportunity for me.

3
00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:18,675
Can you be understanding just once more?

4
00:00:19,903 --> 00:00:21,100
All right.

5
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:23,245
Really? Really?

6
00:00:23,373 --> 00:00:25,245
You're not upset, are you?

7
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:27,310
No, I'm not upset.

8
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:29,710
You're not lying, are you? Are you really okay?

9
00:00:29,713 --> 00:00:31,555
Yes, I'm really fine.

10
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,555
Thank you Seo Jin. I really appreciate it.

11
00:00:34,684 --> 00:00:36,455
Then I'll see you at home later. Okay?

12
00:00:42,859 --> 00:00:44,195
I'm all right.

13
00:00:46,363 --> 00:00:47,535
Really.

14
00:00:49,266 --> 00:00:50,805
I'm really all right.

15
00:00:53,236 --> 00:00:56,330
What? You're making a contract with YS entertainment?

16
00:00:56,339 --> 00:00:57,670
Yes.

17
00:00:57,674 --> 00:01:01,710
That's great news! It's a big company with famous celebrities.

18
00:01:01,711 --> 00:01:05,085
People are finally realizing my talents as an actor now.

19
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:07,685
Really?

20
00:01:08,919 --> 00:01:10,195
Right. Seo Jin.

21
00:01:10,353 --> 00:01:13,195
I'm sorry for bailing on you today.

22
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:15,220
No, It's fine.

23
00:01:15,225 --> 00:01:16,635
It was for work.

24
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:19,220
And you had to go through so much trouble without management.

25
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:20,405
Congratulations.

26
00:01:20,597 --> 00:01:21,765
Thanks.

27
00:01:22,532 --> 00:01:25,505
Jun Ki, you might really become famous now.

28
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:28,430
Maybe I should get your signature in advance.

29
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:32,115
I've been practicing my new sign. Do you want one?

30
00:01:32,576 --> 00:01:33,640
Sure.

31
00:01:33,643 --> 00:01:35,785
Okay. In that case,

32
00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:39,415
I'll give you my first signature.

33
00:01:42,552 --> 00:01:46,595
Lee...

34
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:17,295
Gosh, I fell asleep.

35
00:02:19,823 --> 00:02:22,020
Jun Ki, isn't it finished yet?

36
00:02:22,025 --> 00:02:23,720
Just wait a bit longer.

37
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:25,735
- Then I'll go to my room now. - What?

38
00:02:25,862 --> 00:02:28,860
I need to study to get my baking certificate.

39
00:02:28,865 --> 00:02:30,205
Really?

40
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,505
When I'm done with this, I'll take it to your room.

41
00:02:33,637 --> 00:02:34,730
Okay.

42
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:37,845
Now that the "Lee" part is over...

43
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:42,945
Jun...

44
00:02:55,325 --> 00:02:58,265
(The Dancer in the Dark)

45
00:03:00,697 --> 00:03:01,865
Yes, Father.

46
00:03:03,066 --> 00:03:04,875
I'm going to sign the contract.

47
00:03:05,535 --> 00:03:09,475
Don't worry. I've read the contract in detail.

48
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:13,485
Yes. I'll call you afterwards. Okay.

49
00:03:14,644 --> 00:03:16,210
What did he say? Is he happy?

50
00:03:16,213 --> 00:03:18,380
Yes. He doesn't show it,

51
00:03:18,381 --> 00:03:20,855
but I can feel how happy he is.

52
00:03:21,551 --> 00:03:23,255
I didn't expect this day to come.

53
00:03:23,353 --> 00:03:25,180
You've finally turned your life around, right?

54
00:03:25,188 --> 00:03:26,525
Right.

55
00:03:26,756 --> 00:03:29,295
I went through a lot for 10 years while working as a nameless actor.

56
00:03:29,326 --> 00:03:31,995
Well, you did go through a lot.

57
00:03:34,097 --> 00:03:36,905
- You're going to act like that? - Tell me, you scum.

58
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:38,530
I got fired again.

59
00:03:38,535 --> 00:03:40,745
With ink like this...

60
00:03:42,005 --> 00:03:43,375
Gosh, even thinking about that is horrible.

61
00:03:44,074 --> 00:03:45,845
- I'm going now. - Bye.

62
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:51,280
Where did Soo Ah go after making me answer...

63
00:03:51,281 --> 00:03:53,055
all these inquiries on the shopping mall?

64
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,985
Du Shik! Du Shik!

65
00:03:57,787 --> 00:03:59,720
- Look at this. - Why the fuss?

66
00:03:59,723 --> 00:04:02,250
- What is it? - I designed it myself.

67
00:04:02,259 --> 00:04:06,365
If we only resell products, we won't be able to go further.

68
00:04:06,796 --> 00:04:09,535
So you want to sell clothes that you've designed?

69
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,235
Yes. Do you want to see it?

70
00:04:12,102 --> 00:04:13,675
Look.

71
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:17,575
It's Soorgio Armhany 2018 SS vintage collection,

72
00:04:17,741 --> 00:04:20,210
Ultra-V-Neck Sweater. What do you think?

73
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:24,155
Well, but why is the chest part so exposed?

74
00:04:25,048 --> 00:04:28,480
Normal V-necks are so normal, and they're not sexy.

75
00:04:28,485 --> 00:04:32,450
This one has the V-neck line further down just above the navel.

76
00:04:32,455 --> 00:04:34,795
It emphasizes sexiness.

77
00:04:34,924 --> 00:04:36,390
What do you think? Isn't it cool?

78
00:04:36,393 --> 00:04:38,665
It's cool, but I think...

79
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:40,760
it's too exposed.

80
00:04:40,764 --> 00:04:42,690
No, it's fine.

81
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,235
People like unconventional designs nowadays.

82
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,705
But why aren't you wearing it?

83
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:50,045
What?

84
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:52,440
You want me to wear it? Why?

85
00:04:52,442 --> 00:04:55,110
You're the model. We should take a picture and upload it.

86
00:04:55,111 --> 00:04:56,440
What? Me?

87
00:04:56,446 --> 00:04:58,040
When, where, what, how, and why?

88
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:00,180
You should just do it if your boss says so.

89
00:05:00,183 --> 00:05:02,110
- Be quiet, and follow me. - Why me?

90
00:05:02,118 --> 00:05:03,950
I'm busy, you bad boss.

91
00:05:03,953 --> 00:05:07,325
- Follow me! - No, it will show my naval.

92
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,530
What do you think? Do you like the conditions?

93
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:18,160
Yes, it's all good.

94
00:05:18,168 --> 00:05:20,205
In that case, sign it.

95
00:05:21,538 --> 00:05:22,705
Should I?

96
00:05:26,976 --> 00:05:31,055
Lee...

97
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:37,895
Jun...

98
00:05:40,056 --> 00:05:45,165
- Isn't it done yet? - Jun...

99
00:05:45,395 --> 00:05:49,465
Ki...

100
00:05:53,303 --> 00:05:54,575
It's done now.

101
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:55,975
Really?

102
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,645
I look forward to working with you.

103
00:05:58,675 --> 00:06:00,715
Thank you. I look forward to it too.

104
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:05,710
So... See here.

105
00:06:05,715 --> 00:06:09,150
The baby tiger and the daddy tiger...

106
00:06:09,152 --> 00:06:12,720
lived together happily ever after.

107
00:06:12,722 --> 00:06:14,065
The end.

108
00:06:15,325 --> 00:06:18,695
Sol, what do you think the point of this story is?

109
00:06:19,863 --> 00:06:23,530
The point of this story is "daddy".

110
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:25,935
Say "daddy".

111
00:06:26,236 --> 00:06:29,605
Gosh, you're not easy, are you?

112
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:33,815
Sol, please say "daddy".

113
00:06:33,843 --> 00:06:36,070
Just once? Please?

114
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:38,685
- Say "daddy". - What are you doing?

115
00:06:39,549 --> 00:06:42,385
Nothing. I was reading a book for Sol.

116
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,125
What is that? It looks like something a cool beggar would wear.

117
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,120
What? A cool beggar?

118
00:06:51,127 --> 00:06:54,065
It looks like it'd be really cool if you wore it.

119
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,930
Where did you buy that?

120
00:06:55,932 --> 00:06:57,160
I didn't buy this.

121
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:59,600
Soo Ah designed this herself.

122
00:06:59,602 --> 00:07:02,000
What? Soo Ah makes clothes now?

123
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:03,200
Yes.

124
00:07:03,206 --> 00:07:06,240
That's not the end. She wants me to wear it around for publicity.

125
00:07:06,242 --> 00:07:09,645
Gosh, Min Soo Ah is definitely crazy.

126
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,210
- I'm home. - Hello.

127
00:07:12,215 --> 00:07:13,950
Hello. How was the contract?

128
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,385
It was okay.

129
00:07:17,554 --> 00:07:19,495
What is that? It looks like something a cool beggar would wear.

130
00:07:19,722 --> 00:07:21,650
He says Soo Ah designed it.

131
00:07:21,658 --> 00:07:23,295
Isn't it funny?

132
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,830
It's so funny. I can see your naval.

133
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,765
You're so open-minded. Gosh.

134
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:30,705
Seriously. Stop.

135
00:07:33,336 --> 00:07:36,275
What is this? Why did you stop talking when I arrived?

136
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:38,240
You were saying bad things about me, weren't you?

137
00:07:38,241 --> 00:07:39,545
No.

138
00:07:39,809 --> 00:07:42,845
We were complimenting your clothes.

139
00:07:43,112 --> 00:07:44,640
He's right.

140
00:07:44,647 --> 00:07:47,855
It's great. It makes Du Shik look so much better.

141
00:07:49,152 --> 00:07:51,180
Really? Do you like it that much?

142
00:07:51,187 --> 00:07:52,695
- What? - What?

143
00:07:54,123 --> 00:07:56,095
Now, look at you two.

144
00:07:57,527 --> 00:07:58,665
Be quiet.

145
00:07:58,962 --> 00:08:00,505
What is this?

146
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:04,460
You guys look like three cool beggar brothers.

147
00:08:04,467 --> 00:08:06,375
- Don't they? - They do.

148
00:08:06,703 --> 00:08:10,000
You look cool and sexy, Dong Gu.

149
00:08:10,006 --> 00:08:12,915
Why are you doing that, Yoon Ah? It's so embarrassing.

150
00:08:13,109 --> 00:08:14,515
What is this?

151
00:08:14,644 --> 00:08:17,380
But why is Soo Ah suddenly into designing?

152
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:20,155
I don't know. She's so passionate,

153
00:08:20,216 --> 00:08:22,985
so I can't tell her it's weird. Gosh, it's driving me crazy.

154
00:08:23,186 --> 00:08:25,755
But still, what is this? Gosh.

155
00:08:26,122 --> 00:08:27,850
- Right, Yoon Ah? - Exactly.

156
00:08:27,857 --> 00:08:30,265
It's a bit too extreme, right?

157
00:08:30,293 --> 00:08:31,535
- It's... - Stop.

158
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,095
Hey, you were all here.

159
00:08:34,531 --> 00:08:37,135
What is this? Why are you all quiet again?

160
00:08:37,734 --> 00:08:39,960
You've been saying bad things about me, haven't you?

161
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:41,030
Of course not.

162
00:08:41,037 --> 00:08:43,030
We were saying...

163
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,670
the sweater you designed looked awesome.

164
00:08:44,674 --> 00:08:47,510
That's right. They look so sophisticated.

165
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:48,815
It's so pretty.

166
00:08:48,845 --> 00:08:51,155
Really? You like it that much?

167
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:56,655
What is this?

168
00:08:56,819 --> 00:08:58,125
The sleeves are...

169
00:08:59,522 --> 00:09:01,090
just too long.

170
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:02,720
Oh, it's...

171
00:09:02,725 --> 00:09:06,460
a part of Soorgio Armhany's 2018 SS Cutie Collection.

172
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,160
It's called Bongsan Number Five.

173
00:09:08,164 --> 00:09:11,275
It was inspired by the Bongsan mask dance.

174
00:09:12,835 --> 00:09:13,975
I see.

175
00:09:14,337 --> 00:09:17,700
But aren't the sleeves a bit too long?

176
00:09:17,707 --> 00:09:21,215
That's the point.

177
00:09:21,244 --> 00:09:24,510
Existing hoodies look so boring.

178
00:09:24,514 --> 00:09:27,550
By adding extremely long sleeves,

179
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,355
I gave the hoodie a cute look.

180
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,155
What do you think? Isn't it so cute?

181
00:09:32,221 --> 00:09:34,850
It is. Thank you.

182
00:09:34,857 --> 00:09:35,950
You're welcome.

183
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:38,160
Just wear it every day...

184
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:40,190
so people can see it, okay?

185
00:09:40,196 --> 00:09:42,235
- Okay. - Okay.

186
00:09:42,398 --> 00:09:44,275
- We will. - Of course.

187
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:46,305
Hello.

188
00:09:46,736 --> 00:09:47,875
Yes.

189
00:09:48,271 --> 00:09:49,405
What?

190
00:09:49,872 --> 00:09:51,045
Me?

191
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,745
Okay.

192
00:09:55,645 --> 00:09:57,080
Who was it?

193
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,985
It was the director of my agency.

194
00:09:59,082 --> 00:10:01,485
Choi Min Sik was supposed to throw the first pitch,

195
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,425
but he caught the flu.

196
00:10:03,653 --> 00:10:06,895
So the director wants me to do it instead.

197
00:10:08,491 --> 00:10:11,420
- You'll throw the first pitch? - For a professional game?

198
00:10:11,427 --> 00:10:13,790
- Yes. - Congratulations.

199
00:10:13,796 --> 00:10:16,130
Only real celebrities get to do that.

200
00:10:16,132 --> 00:10:17,275
I know.

201
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,775
I guess this is a perk of having an agency.

202
00:10:20,937 --> 00:10:23,105
- I'll throw the first pitch. - I can't believe it.

203
00:10:23,406 --> 00:10:24,615
Congratulations.

204
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:28,085
Let's go over first pitches that attracted a lot of attention.

205
00:10:28,311 --> 00:10:29,815
Clara's leggings.

206
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,085
Cheng Xiao's 360° turn.

207
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:35,055
Shin Soo Ji's acrobatic first pitch.

208
00:10:35,084 --> 00:10:36,680
After their first pitches,

209
00:10:36,686 --> 00:10:39,720
their images improved by 13-fold.

210
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:42,720
And the awareness increased by 20-fold.

211
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,195
Really?

212
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,005
They hold a meeting for the first pitch?

213
00:10:48,197 --> 00:10:51,075
A big company sure is different.

214
00:10:51,834 --> 00:10:54,105
We need something new and different.

215
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:55,530
Do you have any ideas?

216
00:10:55,538 --> 00:10:59,045
Jun Ki is playing an anchor in the drama.

217
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:02,340
He could dress like Sohn Suk Hee...

218
00:11:02,345 --> 00:11:04,840
and throw a ball that looks like a microphone.

219
00:11:04,847 --> 00:11:06,580
That sounds boring.

220
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:07,955
Do you have any other ideas?

221
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:09,685
No?

222
00:11:10,353 --> 00:11:13,425
There are so many of us. How can we have no other ideas?

223
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,435
Honey.

224
00:11:20,363 --> 00:11:21,505
What?

225
00:11:22,865 --> 00:11:25,100
You want to learn pole dancing?

226
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,930
Sure. Do whatever you want.

227
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,575
Okay.

228
00:11:31,641 --> 00:11:32,745
Hold on.

229
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:35,045
Pole dance?

230
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,025
Well...

231
00:11:43,886 --> 00:11:46,755
You want me to practice pole dancing here?

232
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:50,195
The director doesn't want it to leak to the press.

233
00:11:50,593 --> 00:11:51,820
Confidentiality is everything.

234
00:11:51,828 --> 00:11:54,390
But a pole dancing first pitch just sounds weird.

235
00:11:54,397 --> 00:11:56,660
I can't throw a ball while pole dancing.

236
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:57,760
It doesn't make sense.

237
00:11:57,767 --> 00:12:00,275
What can we do? It's the director's idea.

238
00:12:01,204 --> 00:12:02,700
Gosh, it's driving me crazy.

239
00:12:02,705 --> 00:12:04,840
Should we start practicing?

240
00:12:04,841 --> 00:12:08,140
I'll demonstrate for you. Watch carefully.

241
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,285
Okay.

242
00:12:12,548 --> 00:12:13,655
Gosh.

243
00:12:18,187 --> 00:12:20,055
What do you think? Doesn't it look easy?

244
00:12:20,189 --> 00:12:22,265
No. I can't do this.

245
00:12:22,391 --> 00:12:23,525
Please excuse me.

246
00:12:24,427 --> 00:12:27,205
Come on. Practice makes perfect.

247
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,030
Let's start from hanging.

248
00:12:29,031 --> 00:12:30,605
Hanging?

249
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,200
Be serious.

250
00:12:37,206 --> 00:12:38,845
Use your arms. Try again.

251
00:12:42,378 --> 00:12:43,685
It's hot. Hey.

252
00:12:43,746 --> 00:12:44,855
Again.

253
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:47,585
Again.

254
00:12:49,252 --> 00:12:50,780
Ma'am!

255
00:12:50,787 --> 00:12:54,165
Help me! Ma'am!

256
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:56,725
Gosh, it's killing me.

257
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,395
Gosh.

258
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:02,205
After spending all day on the pole, my whole body aches.

259
00:13:02,298 --> 00:13:04,160
Is this really necessary?

260
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:07,100
What can I do? It's the director's idea.

261
00:13:07,103 --> 00:13:09,045
I'm worried you'll hurt yourself.

262
00:13:09,105 --> 00:13:12,175
It's okay. This is such a great opportunity.

263
00:13:13,576 --> 00:13:15,045
I... Gosh.

264
00:13:15,411 --> 00:13:17,855
I'll work hard and become successful...

265
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,280
so that I can give you...

266
00:13:20,283 --> 00:13:21,855
anything you want.

267
00:13:22,318 --> 00:13:25,425
I'm so touched I want to cry.

268
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,165
Bacca.

269
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,665
I don't think pain-relieving patches are enough.

270
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,665
I need something else too.

271
00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:33,965
What do you mean?

272
00:13:36,465 --> 00:13:38,100
Gosh.

273
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,035
Why did you hit me?

274
00:13:40,169 --> 00:13:42,930
If you have to hit me, do it with your lips.

275
00:13:42,939 --> 00:13:44,040
Forget it.

276
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,715
- Don't be like that. - Stop.

277
00:13:49,979 --> 00:13:51,985
We're not getting any orders.

278
00:13:52,715 --> 00:13:53,780
Look at that.

279
00:13:53,783 --> 00:13:55,825
I knew no one would want that sweater.

280
00:13:56,219 --> 00:13:58,425
I hope no one I know sees this.

281
00:13:58,955 --> 00:14:01,195
I'll have to ask Soo Ah to take down these pictures.

282
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,435
Soo Ah. By the way...

283
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,605
She seems pretty serious.

284
00:14:13,402 --> 00:14:14,905
Did she fall asleep like this?

285
00:14:20,743 --> 00:14:21,885
Gosh, it stinks.

286
00:14:22,178 --> 00:14:23,615
What did she eat?

287
00:14:24,847 --> 00:14:26,085
What?

288
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:30,780
Hey. What are you doing here?

289
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:32,125
I just came by.

290
00:14:35,324 --> 00:14:37,050
What is it? Why are you laughing?

291
00:14:37,059 --> 00:14:38,495
Well...

292
00:14:38,761 --> 00:14:41,635
I just farted in my dream.

293
00:14:43,032 --> 00:14:46,275
It felt so real.

294
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:48,705
Of course.

295
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:51,015
I'm sure it did.

296
00:14:51,674 --> 00:14:52,800
Director Bong.

297
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:55,645
Have we gotten any orders for the sweater I designed?

298
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:58,315
Not yet.

299
00:14:58,447 --> 00:14:59,515
Really?

300
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:02,455
Why isn't anyone buying it?

301
00:15:02,551 --> 00:15:04,555
Is my design that bad?

302
00:15:05,288 --> 00:15:08,565
It hasn't been exposed a lot yet.

303
00:15:08,858 --> 00:15:09,990
Cheer up.

304
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,495
- You think so? - Yes.

305
00:15:11,594 --> 00:15:13,895
Should we try to expose it more?

306
00:15:15,197 --> 00:15:16,465
I have an idea.

307
00:15:24,607 --> 00:15:26,375
What's that?

308
00:15:27,109 --> 00:15:29,510
This is Soorgio Armhany's new product,

309
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:32,080
Ultra-V-Neck Sweater. Take a look.

310
00:15:32,081 --> 00:15:33,110
Here.

311
00:15:33,115 --> 00:15:34,310
Take a look.

312
00:15:34,317 --> 00:15:37,820
It's so pretty, right? It looks amazing. It's so sexy.

313
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,095
Girls, take a look.

314
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,765
Thank you.

315
00:15:42,258 --> 00:15:44,395
Come take a look.

316
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,265
Hey.

317
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:50,900
Thank you. We're Soorgio Armhany.

318
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:54,130
- Soo Ah, I can't believe you. - It was designed by me.

319
00:15:54,136 --> 00:15:55,805
- This is just too much. - Soorgio Armhany...

320
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:58,045
- It's so embarrassing. - Ultra-V-Neck Sweater.

321
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,380
- You're getting the hang of it. - Right?

322
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,755
I became a lot better after practicing all night.

323
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:15,295
But I'm not sure if I can throw a ball while dancing.

324
00:16:15,524 --> 00:16:17,590
Is that so? Do you want me to help?

325
00:16:17,593 --> 00:16:18,760
I'm free today.

326
00:16:18,761 --> 00:16:21,635
Really? That'd be great.

327
00:16:23,432 --> 00:16:24,505
You're an angel.

328
00:16:25,501 --> 00:16:28,375
- Let's have fun at the playground. - Okay.

329
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,695
Chae Rin, let's go to another playground.

330
00:16:55,464 --> 00:16:57,430
- Jun Ki. - Yes?

331
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,935
Should we start?

332
00:17:00,369 --> 00:17:01,705
Will you be all right?

333
00:17:02,204 --> 00:17:03,770
You've never played baseball.

334
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:05,815
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

335
00:17:05,908 --> 00:17:07,100
Throw the ball.

336
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,745
Are you sure? Then I'll throw it.

337
00:17:15,584 --> 00:17:16,725
Seo Jin!

338
00:17:17,686 --> 00:17:20,155
Seo Jin! Are you okay?

339
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:24,135
I'm okay. Try again.

340
00:17:24,827 --> 00:17:27,060
- I'll try again. - Okay.

341
00:17:27,063 --> 00:17:28,335
I'm sorry.

342
00:17:35,404 --> 00:17:36,575
Hold on.

343
00:17:40,709 --> 00:17:43,085
- I'm sorry. - You're doing great.

344
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:53,925
Do you want to try?

345
00:18:11,707 --> 00:18:13,745
Designing clothes is not easy.

346
00:18:19,048 --> 00:18:21,480
How long do we have to wear these?

347
00:18:21,484 --> 00:18:23,185
It's so embarrassing.

348
00:18:23,419 --> 00:18:25,380
Don't say that in front of Soo Ah.

349
00:18:25,387 --> 00:18:26,750
She's working hard.

350
00:18:26,755 --> 00:18:28,220
Still, this is just not okay.

351
00:18:28,224 --> 00:18:31,265
No one would want this rag. Don't you think?

352
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,420
Maybe we should tell her the truth and make her give up...

353
00:18:33,429 --> 00:18:35,405
for her sake.

354
00:18:36,665 --> 00:18:37,860
We shouldn't just play along with her.

355
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:39,875
- I'd rather go naked... - Gosh.

356
00:18:40,769 --> 00:18:41,845
Soo Ah.

357
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:44,915
I get it. That's what you thought.

358
00:18:46,075 --> 00:18:48,345
- Soo Ah, it's not what you think. - I'm sorry...

359
00:18:48,744 --> 00:18:50,345
for forcing you to wear rags.

360
00:18:51,514 --> 00:18:54,010
Soo Ah. That's not what I mean.

361
00:18:54,016 --> 00:18:55,810
- Soo Ah. - Listen, Soo Ah.

362
00:18:55,818 --> 00:18:57,425
- Soo Ah. - Soo Ah.

363
00:19:00,589 --> 00:19:02,165
I'm sorry, Soo Ah.

364
00:19:02,691 --> 00:19:05,265
I didn't mean that you weren't talented.

365
00:19:05,528 --> 00:19:08,105
Your clothes are so unconventional.

366
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,760
It's hard for me to look good in them.

367
00:19:10,766 --> 00:19:12,600
He's right. Your clothes are pretty.

368
00:19:12,601 --> 00:19:14,630
They don't look good because our bodies are ugly.

369
00:19:14,637 --> 00:19:16,775
Forget it. You're right.

370
00:19:16,939 --> 00:19:18,745
I can't be a designer.

371
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:23,415
- What's that sound? - There must be an order.

372
00:19:23,612 --> 00:19:24,885
That's great.

373
00:19:26,515 --> 00:19:28,225
- What? - What's wrong?

374
00:19:28,317 --> 00:19:29,485
Look at this.

375
00:19:29,818 --> 00:19:31,895
I have orders for the v-neck sweater.

376
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:33,850
- Someone ordered 5. - 5?

377
00:19:33,856 --> 00:19:36,525
What? Someone also ordered the hoodie.

378
00:19:37,893 --> 00:19:40,565
Some people buy them after all.

379
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:45,275
Didn't I tell you that unconventional styles were popular?

380
00:19:45,401 --> 00:19:47,475
You know nothing about fashion.

381
00:19:49,138 --> 00:19:52,000
I'm sorry. I didn't have an eye for it.

382
00:19:52,007 --> 00:19:53,215
Right.

383
00:19:53,309 --> 00:19:56,115
We should be honored to wear such amazing clothes.

384
00:19:58,247 --> 00:20:01,755
Really? I have some clothes that I recently designed.

385
00:20:02,351 --> 00:20:03,780
- Do you want them? - What?

386
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:04,925
What?

387
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,720
- Soo Ah. - Yes?

388
00:20:12,728 --> 00:20:14,235
What kind of shorts are these?

389
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:19,475
They are a part of Soorgio Armhany's 2018 SS Sexy Collection.

390
00:20:19,501 --> 00:20:21,370
They're called Ultra Fire Shorts.

391
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:23,800
I shortened the length of the shorts...

392
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:25,445
to focus on sexiness.

393
00:20:25,608 --> 00:20:27,575
- What do you think? - They're nice.

394
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:30,185
They're sexy and cool.

395
00:20:30,412 --> 00:20:31,585
They're embarrassing.

396
00:20:32,214 --> 00:20:33,415
Soo Ah.

397
00:20:33,549 --> 00:20:36,650
Aren't these too short though?

398
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:39,725
Come on, that's the charm.

399
00:20:39,788 --> 00:20:42,750
I'm giving them to you as a special gift.

400
00:20:42,758 --> 00:20:46,265
Wear it every day so people can see it, okay?

401
00:20:46,362 --> 00:20:48,535
- Okay. - Of course.

402
00:20:50,232 --> 00:20:51,475
They look great.

403
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:58,315
You'll do well today, right?

404
00:20:58,707 --> 00:21:02,210
Of course. You helped me so much.

405
00:21:02,211 --> 00:21:03,645
I have to do well.

406
00:21:04,213 --> 00:21:06,885
If you came and cheered for me,

407
00:21:06,949 --> 00:21:08,585
I would do better.

408
00:21:08,717 --> 00:21:11,450
I'm sorry, but I have work today.

409
00:21:11,453 --> 00:21:13,595
It's okay. Work can't be helped.

410
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:15,365
Instead...

411
00:21:17,092 --> 00:21:19,095
- Ta-da. - What's that?

412
00:21:19,595 --> 00:21:21,635
- Is it a mustache? - It's a lucky charm.

413
00:21:21,897 --> 00:21:23,065
Give me your hand.

414
00:21:23,832 --> 00:21:26,330
Even if I'm not with you, take a look at it.

415
00:21:26,335 --> 00:21:29,045
Think that I'm always beside you, okay?

416
00:21:29,638 --> 00:21:30,805
Thank you.

417
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:32,645
You know that I'm your number one fan, right?

418
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,415
Don't forget that I'm always cheering for you.

419
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:36,715
I won't.

420
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:39,685
I have another present.

421
00:21:40,082 --> 00:21:41,255
What is it?

422
00:21:45,154 --> 00:21:46,955
You can do it, Jun Ki. See you later.

423
00:21:47,089 --> 00:21:48,265
I can do it.

424
00:21:48,424 --> 00:21:49,990
- Have a good time. - Bye.

425
00:21:49,992 --> 00:21:51,235
You can do it.

426
00:21:57,466 --> 00:21:59,775
My goodness.

427
00:22:00,035 --> 00:22:01,570
I have to go to the office.

428
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:04,615
How can I go while looking like this?

429
00:22:05,207 --> 00:22:08,615
I should get changed and leave from the window.

430
00:22:10,312 --> 00:22:11,855
Du Shik, may I borrow your laptop?

431
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,755
What are you doing?

432
00:22:16,118 --> 00:22:18,955
Are you taking it off?

433
00:22:20,522 --> 00:22:22,765
No, I was putting it on.

434
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:25,165
I really like your clothes.

435
00:22:26,061 --> 00:22:27,990
Really? Where's Du Shik?

436
00:22:27,996 --> 00:22:30,205
He went out to meet a friend for a while.

437
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:35,775
Yes, director...

438
00:22:36,672 --> 00:22:38,875
I'm on my way.

439
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:41,645
I'll hurry. I'm sorry.

440
00:22:42,678 --> 00:22:44,540
Are you going to the office? See you.

441
00:22:44,546 --> 00:22:45,685
Thanks.

442
00:22:48,384 --> 00:22:50,625
You should go. Make sure many people see it.

443
00:22:50,652 --> 00:22:51,825
Okay.

444
00:22:54,022 --> 00:22:55,865
- What is it? - I have something to take out.

445
00:22:57,025 --> 00:22:58,235
See you later.

446
00:22:59,428 --> 00:23:01,665
Where is the laptop?

447
00:23:18,013 --> 00:23:19,215
What's this?

448
00:23:24,353 --> 00:23:26,025
These are the clothes that you asked for.

449
00:23:26,255 --> 00:23:27,725
Thank you.

450
00:23:28,857 --> 00:23:31,020
What's Soorgio Armhany anyway?

451
00:23:31,026 --> 00:23:33,195
Why do you ask me to order clothes for you?

452
00:23:33,896 --> 00:23:36,830
I have my reason. I'm sorry for bothering you.

453
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:40,575
Are you wearing boxers? You look embarrassing.

454
00:23:41,103 --> 00:23:43,005
Everyone is looking at you.

455
00:23:43,939 --> 00:23:45,600
What? They look cute.

456
00:23:45,607 --> 00:23:48,345
Unconventional style is popular these days.

457
00:23:48,744 --> 00:23:49,885
Hey.

458
00:23:50,446 --> 00:23:52,810
Do you want to try it on? Try it on.

459
00:23:52,815 --> 00:23:54,950
If you like it, recommend it to other people.

460
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:56,255
Go on and try it.

461
00:23:56,418 --> 00:23:58,880
- Are you embarrassed? Try it. - Stop it!

462
00:23:58,887 --> 00:24:00,755
- Come on. - Keep it!

463
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,335
You can start over now.

464
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:15,705
You still have time.

465
00:24:15,904 --> 00:24:19,145
Find work that will make you happy all your life.

466
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:22,110
- Will I make it if I try? - I'll help you with studying.

467
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,985
- You can do it, Soo Ah. - I can do it.

468
00:24:25,647 --> 00:24:27,925
I'll start an online shopping mall.

469
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,355
It's Armhany.

470
00:24:29,852 --> 00:24:33,395
- Shopping Mall Soorgio Armhany - Soorgio Armhany

471
00:24:33,455 --> 00:24:36,095
How can I go home first when you're out here?

472
00:25:03,218 --> 00:25:05,325
- Soo Ah, what are you doing here? - What?

473
00:25:06,321 --> 00:25:08,565
- Nothing. Why? - Why are you annoyed?

474
00:25:08,624 --> 00:25:12,465
I borrowed a game from a friend. Want to play and bet on noodles?

475
00:25:13,161 --> 00:25:15,260
No, thanks. I'm tired, so I'll rest.

476
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,435
You're a pig.

477
00:25:16,832 --> 00:25:18,305
What? Wait.

478
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:21,605
Pig? Where did that come from?

479
00:25:21,637 --> 00:25:22,945
She's crazy.

480
00:25:25,841 --> 00:25:27,145
Did you practice a lot?

481
00:25:27,175 --> 00:25:29,070
Yes, I did my best.

482
00:25:29,077 --> 00:25:31,115
Good job. I guarantee you.

483
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,140
If it gets aired, you'll become popular.

484
00:25:33,148 --> 00:25:35,185
- Do a good job. - Yes, sir.

485
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:36,725
- Where's the outfit? - Yes, sir.

486
00:25:37,352 --> 00:25:38,555
They're here.

487
00:25:39,821 --> 00:25:43,165
Wait, why do you have this?

488
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:46,395
It's a great outfit. It's perfect for pole dancing.

489
00:25:46,728 --> 00:25:48,805
Where did you buy this?

490
00:25:49,031 --> 00:25:52,275
There's a shopping mall that's popular among the stylists.

491
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:54,605
- It's called Soorgio Armhany Mall. - What?

492
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,300
Is Soorgio Armhany Mall popular?

493
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:59,875
Yes, the owner is now selling clothes of her own brand.

494
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,445
The designs are amazing.

495
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:03,215
Isn't it unconventional and sexy?

496
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:05,155
Yes, I guess.

497
00:26:07,916 --> 00:26:09,725
Good job on the interview.

498
00:26:09,952 --> 00:26:11,625
Since work is finished,

499
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:14,195
shall we go somewhere to eat?

500
00:26:14,389 --> 00:26:16,565
- Sorry? Actually... - Yes?

501
00:26:17,025 --> 00:26:20,965
If there isn't more work to do, may I go somewhere?

502
00:26:21,229 --> 00:26:24,565
- I have something to do. - Well... All right.

503
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:27,405
Thank you. See you tomorrow.

504
00:26:28,804 --> 00:26:30,075
Goodbye.

505
00:26:33,909 --> 00:26:37,345
You gave a shocking pole dancing performance today.

506
00:26:37,412 --> 00:26:39,810
The viewer response is already amazing.

507
00:26:39,815 --> 00:26:42,150
Where did you get the idea?

508
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:45,855
The president of my agency came up with the idea.

509
00:26:46,088 --> 00:26:48,250
Many other people helped me...

510
00:26:48,256 --> 00:26:50,325
so that I could give a better performance.

511
00:26:54,329 --> 00:26:55,505
Seo Jin.

512
00:26:56,264 --> 00:26:58,460
- Hello, sir. - What brings you here?

513
00:26:58,467 --> 00:27:01,875
I was in the neighborhood, so I stopped by.

514
00:27:02,671 --> 00:27:04,640
Pole dancing couldn't have been easy.

515
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,970
Wasn't it difficult?

516
00:27:05,974 --> 00:27:09,685
Of course, it was, but many people helped me.

517
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:13,585
There's someone who helped me practice every day.

518
00:27:14,149 --> 00:27:16,285
As I stand here,

519
00:27:16,318 --> 00:27:19,155
I'd like to thank her very much.

520
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:22,425
Is the person your girlfriend?

521
00:27:22,524 --> 00:27:23,695
It is, isn't it?

522
00:27:23,959 --> 00:27:26,465
Pardon? Girlfriend?

523
00:27:35,303 --> 00:27:36,905
No, I don't have a girlfriend.

524
00:27:37,773 --> 00:27:41,145
Really? What's your ideal type?

525
00:27:41,543 --> 00:27:42,745
I'm not sure.

526
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,255
Please support pole dancing.

527
00:27:53,522 --> 00:27:55,495
Jun Ki is still the most searched.

528
00:27:55,824 --> 00:27:57,595
"Pole dancing 1st pitch" is the 2nd most searched.

529
00:27:57,693 --> 00:27:59,065
"I took a dump," is the third.

530
00:28:00,295 --> 00:28:02,090
You got so popular.

531
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:04,290
Pole dancing worked, didn't it?

532
00:28:04,299 --> 00:28:07,375
I had no idea that the response would be so positive.

533
00:28:08,737 --> 00:28:11,275
Life is full of surprises.

534
00:28:12,808 --> 00:28:15,515
There's one thing that makes me uncomfortable.

535
00:28:15,811 --> 00:28:18,115
- What? - You don't have a girlfriend?

536
00:28:19,081 --> 00:28:22,125
Do you not want to be alive any longer?

537
00:28:23,351 --> 00:28:25,650
It's because the president...

538
00:28:25,654 --> 00:28:28,620
told me not to tell anyone that I have a girlfriend.

539
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:31,295
He was so adamant about it, so I couldn't help it.

540
00:28:31,893 --> 00:28:34,165
Seo Jin, I'm really sorry.

541
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:36,505
I should have told you beforehand.

542
00:28:37,265 --> 00:28:38,735
It's okay.

543
00:28:39,067 --> 00:28:40,475
It can't be helped.

544
00:28:40,602 --> 00:28:42,075
Thank you for understanding.

545
00:28:43,505 --> 00:28:46,075
Jun Ki. Why did you wear that outfit?

546
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,375
Aren't those the pieces Soo Ah made?

547
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:49,815
Actually, my stylist brought that outfit.

548
00:28:50,212 --> 00:28:52,340
Apparently, Soo Ah's online shopping mall is really popular...

549
00:28:52,347 --> 00:28:53,510
among stylists these days.

550
00:28:53,515 --> 00:28:55,825
- What? Really? - I'm telling you.

551
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:58,620
Stylists are praising her and saying that she'll become...

552
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,850
the next Coco Chanel.

553
00:28:59,855 --> 00:29:01,925
- Coco Chanel? Really? - Yes.

554
00:29:04,059 --> 00:29:07,260
Gosh. I saw you do the ceremonial first pitch the other day.

555
00:29:07,262 --> 00:29:09,005
I noticed you received a huge response. It was amazing.

556
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,160
Thank you.

557
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,760
I should be the one thanking you.

558
00:29:11,767 --> 00:29:14,005
Thanks to you, our drama got promoted.

559
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:16,245
I was meaning to ask you. You saw the script, right?

560
00:29:16,404 --> 00:29:17,630
Yes, of course.

561
00:29:17,639 --> 00:29:20,570
How does it feel to play the opposing role of Cindy...

562
00:29:20,575 --> 00:29:22,340
who's receiving unconditional love from middle-aged men?

563
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:23,685
It's an honor, of course.

564
00:29:24,045 --> 00:29:26,485
By the way, who are all those people?

565
00:29:27,315 --> 00:29:28,550
They're Cindy's fans.

566
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:30,655
So they're the middle-aged male fans I've been hearing about.

567
00:29:30,819 --> 00:29:32,795
She really must be popular.

568
00:29:32,921 --> 00:29:35,220
- Look. Cindy's here. - It's Cindy. She's coming in.

569
00:29:35,223 --> 00:29:37,190
- Cindy. - Cindy.

570
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,235
- Stop them. - Cindy. Cindy.

571
00:29:39,928 --> 00:29:42,605
- Cindy. - Cindy. Look over here.

572
00:29:47,803 --> 00:29:48,870
(My Love, Cindy, Beautiful Cindy, I love you)

573
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,475
- Cindy. - Cindy.

574
00:29:51,973 --> 00:29:55,915
- Cindy. - Cindy.

575
00:29:57,479 --> 00:29:59,685
- Cindy. - I'll love you forever, Cindy.

576
00:30:00,916 --> 00:30:02,425
- Cindy. - Cindy.

577
00:30:02,484 --> 00:30:04,180
Now, this will be the next scene.

578
00:30:04,186 --> 00:30:07,580
Hae Na, a rookie reporter, meets her first love, Song Jun Seok.

579
00:30:07,589 --> 00:30:10,790
Hae Na notices her first love and runs to Jun Seok...

580
00:30:10,792 --> 00:30:12,460
and throws herself into his arms.

581
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,820
- All right? - Yes.

582
00:30:13,829 --> 00:30:16,035
Let's start shooting right away then.

583
00:30:17,165 --> 00:30:19,135
We'll be starting the shoot now.

584
00:30:21,803 --> 00:30:24,345
Ready and action.

585
00:30:26,308 --> 00:30:27,575
Jun Seok?

586
00:30:28,009 --> 00:30:29,085
Jun Seok.

587
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,355
What do you think you're doing?

588
00:30:36,852 --> 00:30:37,925
Hae Na?

589
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:39,250
It's you, isn't it?

590
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:41,355
Jun Seok. It's been a long time.

591
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:44,965
Cut. All right. That was great.

592
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:47,635
- We'll move onto the bus scene. - Yes, sir.

593
00:30:48,063 --> 00:30:51,030
I must've gotten lipstick on your clothes. I'm sorry.

594
00:30:51,032 --> 00:30:52,860
It could happen.

595
00:30:52,868 --> 00:30:54,075
Don't worry about it.

596
00:30:59,341 --> 00:31:00,815
(May your career be filled with glory, Cindy.)

597
00:31:12,921 --> 00:31:15,165
Why are they looking at me like that?

598
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:17,325
They're scaring me.

599
00:31:18,193 --> 00:31:22,505
(Baking and Confectionery License Performance Test)

600
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:24,905
Almighty. Almighty.

601
00:31:25,166 --> 00:31:28,800
Please help Yoon Ah pass the test.

602
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:31,145
Bring her luck.

603
00:31:31,206 --> 00:31:34,945
I beg you. Please.

604
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:36,085
Gosh. That startled me.

605
00:31:37,212 --> 00:31:39,715
Yoon Ah. Yoon Ah. I'm over here.

606
00:31:40,415 --> 00:31:42,755
Did you finish the test? Did you do well?

607
00:31:45,053 --> 00:31:47,980
What's wrong? You didn't do well?

608
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:49,065
No.

609
00:31:49,424 --> 00:31:51,895
I think I made a lot of mistakes.

610
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:55,235
I get the feeling that I'm going to fail.

611
00:31:55,263 --> 00:31:57,705
The results haven't even come out.

612
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,735
I'm sure you'll pass.

613
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:03,375
I really worked hard for this.

614
00:32:04,472 --> 00:32:08,175
For Sol's sake, I really wanted to pass this test.

615
00:32:13,815 --> 00:32:15,385
Why are you crying?

616
00:32:15,617 --> 00:32:17,725
Don't worry. You'll pass.

617
00:32:18,219 --> 00:32:19,895
Stop crying. Stop.

618
00:32:20,822 --> 00:32:22,325
Dong Gu.

619
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:25,395
Gosh. Come here.

620
00:32:26,294 --> 00:32:28,835
You'll be all right.

621
00:32:34,069 --> 00:32:35,405
It's all right.

622
00:32:41,142 --> 00:32:45,455
(Misfortune Always Comes)

623
00:32:45,981 --> 00:32:47,155
Jun Seok.

624
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:49,825
What do you think you're doing?

625
00:32:49,985 --> 00:32:51,980
Gosh. Jun Ki hugged Korea's sweetheart, Cindy.

626
00:32:51,987 --> 00:32:54,320
Who would've thought this could happen?

627
00:32:54,322 --> 00:32:56,665
Don't make a fuss. We were just acting.

628
00:32:56,791 --> 00:32:58,920
Anyway, Seo Jin, it must bother you.

629
00:32:58,927 --> 00:33:00,035
You must be jealous.

630
00:33:00,528 --> 00:33:03,035
Why would I be jealous of that? It's just acting.

631
00:33:03,131 --> 00:33:04,230
She's right.

632
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:06,335
Bacca's not that narrow-minded.

633
00:33:06,634 --> 00:33:07,900
Right.

634
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:09,030
Let's eat at that restaurant...

635
00:33:09,037 --> 00:33:10,805
we couldn't go to last time this Sunday.

636
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,270
That's all right. I know you're busy these days.

637
00:33:13,274 --> 00:33:15,510
No. It's not just any other day. It's your birthday.

638
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:17,085
How could we possibly not celebrate?

639
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:19,940
I'll make it this time no matter what,

640
00:33:19,948 --> 00:33:21,810
so make sure to keep your schedule open, okay?

641
00:33:21,816 --> 00:33:23,055
All right. I will.

642
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,685
It's your birthday?

643
00:33:26,054 --> 00:33:28,695
How can you not know your one and only sister's birthday?

644
00:33:29,024 --> 00:33:31,165
That would be expecting too much from you, right?

645
00:33:34,529 --> 00:33:36,865
I'm going to do some grocery shopping.

646
00:33:41,703 --> 00:33:43,475
Hey. What's wrong with Yoon Ah?

647
00:33:44,172 --> 00:33:46,445
I don't think she did too well on the license test.

648
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:49,015
She's been gloomy the past several days.

649
00:33:49,144 --> 00:33:51,540
Then why don't you take her out and cheer her up?

650
00:33:51,546 --> 00:33:54,055
I've tried, but nothing works.

651
00:33:54,349 --> 00:33:56,385
Do you know any way I could cheer her up?

652
00:33:56,484 --> 00:33:58,695
In that case, what's most important is...

653
00:33:59,721 --> 00:34:01,725
for you to find a way yourself.

654
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:04,165
- I have a shoot to do. Bye. - Bye.

655
00:34:04,426 --> 00:34:05,535
That jerk.

656
00:34:10,698 --> 00:34:12,035
Jun Ki. I'm sorry.

657
00:34:12,067 --> 00:34:14,160
I was on my way to pick you up when the car broke down.

658
00:34:14,169 --> 00:34:16,530
It's all right. I can grab a taxi.

659
00:34:16,538 --> 00:34:19,245
Don't worry about it. I'll see you at the set.

660
00:34:22,343 --> 00:34:23,370
Taxi.

661
00:34:23,378 --> 00:34:25,685
My goodness. Gosh.

662
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,240
What was that?

663
00:34:27,248 --> 00:34:29,625
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

664
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:31,655
I dropped it by mistake while watering my plants.

665
00:34:32,887 --> 00:34:34,555
You should've been more careful.

666
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:37,465
I could've gotten hurt!

667
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:39,820
I'm truly sorry. Please forgive me. I'm sorry.

668
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:41,135
Never mind. It's all right.

669
00:34:43,131 --> 00:34:44,765
That scared me to death.

670
00:34:46,868 --> 00:34:48,005
Taxi.

671
00:34:50,305 --> 00:34:52,045
Welcome, sir.

672
00:34:52,307 --> 00:34:53,500
Where would you like me to take you?

673
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:55,245
JBC broadcasting station, please.

674
00:34:56,377 --> 00:34:58,315
I think I've seen you somewhere.

675
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,915
You recognize me.

676
00:35:00,115 --> 00:35:02,350
You must've seen my pole dancing during the ceremonial first pitch.

677
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,885
Pole dancing first pitch? What is that?

678
00:35:05,553 --> 00:35:06,755
Do you not know?

679
00:35:07,388 --> 00:35:09,220
Then you must watch the drama "Newsroom".

680
00:35:09,224 --> 00:35:10,425
"Newsroom"?

681
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:13,595
That's right. You're Song Jun Seok.

682
00:35:14,662 --> 00:35:17,130
There was a scene where you hugged Cindy.

683
00:35:17,132 --> 00:35:19,535
You even remember specific scenes.

684
00:35:20,468 --> 00:35:22,045
You're right. That was me.

685
00:35:23,671 --> 00:35:25,540
Would you like my autograph?

686
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,745
No, thank you.

687
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:28,645
I'll be going now then.

688
00:35:37,418 --> 00:35:39,855
How could you get carsick from a taxi ride?

689
00:35:41,122 --> 00:35:42,265
I don't even want to talk about it.

690
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:44,465
You wouldn't imagine how fast the driver was driving.

691
00:35:44,526 --> 00:35:46,265
I thought I was going to die.

692
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:47,735
Come to think of it, it's strange.

693
00:35:47,929 --> 00:35:50,530
Earlier on, a flower pot fell toward my head.

694
00:35:50,532 --> 00:35:52,535
I could've almost died.

695
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:54,435
Today must be an unlucky day.

696
00:35:54,602 --> 00:35:55,845
I guess so.

697
00:35:57,305 --> 00:35:58,445
Hold on.

698
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,015
That taxi driver...

699
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:03,115
looked familiar.

700
00:36:03,545 --> 00:36:06,080
There was a scene where you hugged Cindy.

701
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,225
Cindy. Milky-white Cindy.

702
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:12,620
That's right. It was him. He's one of Cindy's middle-aged fans.

703
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:15,220
What? The taxi driver was one of Cindy's middle-aged fans?

704
00:36:15,223 --> 00:36:16,220
Yes.

705
00:36:16,224 --> 00:36:18,735
He was one of the fans that came to root for Cindy on set.

706
00:36:19,561 --> 00:36:20,695
Wait.

707
00:36:20,995 --> 00:36:22,260
My goodness.

708
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:23,430
Are you all right?

709
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:25,905
Cindy!

710
00:36:27,569 --> 00:36:31,505
Wait. That guy that dropped the flower pot was also Cindy's fan.

711
00:36:31,673 --> 00:36:33,700
That can't be. You must've mistaken them.

712
00:36:33,708 --> 00:36:35,215
No. I'm positive.

713
00:36:35,243 --> 00:36:37,515
You don't think they're getting back at me...

714
00:36:37,645 --> 00:36:39,440
for hugging Cindy in that scene, do you?

715
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:41,080
Gosh. That's nonsense.

716
00:36:41,082 --> 00:36:42,925
I don't think the fans would harass you for hugging her.

717
00:36:44,419 --> 00:36:45,555
Right?

718
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:57,830
Why would I? Why would I like Du Shik?

719
00:36:57,832 --> 00:37:01,375
He's not good-looking and doesn't even have a good body.

720
00:37:04,505 --> 00:37:05,615
But...

721
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:08,175
he is cute in his own way.

722
00:37:09,277 --> 00:37:11,410
What am I saying? I'm crazy.

723
00:37:11,412 --> 00:37:13,710
I must've lost my mind.

724
00:37:13,715 --> 00:37:15,950
Get a hold of yourself. This isn't like you. What's wrong with you?

725
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:17,025
What are you doing?

726
00:37:17,218 --> 00:37:18,895
Why are you looking at a picture of me?

727
00:37:20,622 --> 00:37:21,855
I wasn't looking at it at all.

728
00:37:21,923 --> 00:37:23,790
I was just erasing your pictures because you're so ugly.

729
00:37:23,791 --> 00:37:25,635
What? You brat.

730
00:37:26,127 --> 00:37:27,760
Never mind. Be quiet. Get out.

731
00:37:27,762 --> 00:37:29,630
You're so ugly. I don't want to look at you. Get out, you pig.

732
00:37:29,631 --> 00:37:31,190
What? Pig?

733
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:34,075
Hey. Why do you keep calling me a pig? Are you crazy?

734
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:38,045
I don't want to talk to you, so get out, you pig.

735
00:37:38,706 --> 00:37:40,775
All right. I'll leave you, you fool.

736
00:37:41,142 --> 00:37:42,415
Go on farting.

737
00:37:47,048 --> 00:37:50,155
See? He's ugly and even has a bad temper.

738
00:37:51,886 --> 00:37:53,825
But he is kind of tough.

739
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:55,495
He's sexy.

740
00:37:56,224 --> 00:37:58,935
Wait. What am I saying? I've gone crazy.

741
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,035
No. This isn't me. This isn't me.

742
00:38:03,398 --> 00:38:04,430
He's amazing.

743
00:38:04,432 --> 00:38:06,435
(Song Jun Seok of "Newsroom" Pole Dances During the First Pitch.)

744
00:38:07,302 --> 00:38:08,635
Good job.

745
00:38:13,241 --> 00:38:15,885
(Actor Lee Jun Ki Is Currently Single!)

746
00:38:19,914 --> 00:38:23,625
What do you think you're doing? You should be working.

747
00:38:24,952 --> 00:38:26,195
It's Lee Jun Ki.

748
00:38:26,688 --> 00:38:28,255
This guy is really popular these days.

749
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:30,025
You were a fan of Lee Jun Ki too?

750
00:38:31,459 --> 00:38:32,595
Yes.

751
00:38:33,027 --> 00:38:34,765
- You see, Jun Ki's my... - Yes?

752
00:38:37,098 --> 00:38:39,600
No. I mean he's my brother's friend.

753
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,675
Really?

754
00:38:40,835 --> 00:38:42,170
That's great.

755
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:45,205
Then I'll ask you for help if I need an interview.

756
00:38:45,873 --> 00:38:47,045
- Sure. - Okay.

757
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,085
Anyway, I'm going on a date soon. What should I wear?

758
00:38:57,485 --> 00:39:00,620
Is this the workroom of the rapper who's in charge of our soundtrack?

759
00:39:00,621 --> 00:39:02,750
Yes, he's called MC Dacopy.

760
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,595
He's on the rise these days.

761
00:39:05,526 --> 00:39:07,565
His raps are great.

762
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:09,235
Dacopy.

763
00:39:10,498 --> 00:39:12,775
He's here. Hello.

764
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:16,105
What's up?

765
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:17,945
Long time no see.

766
00:39:19,374 --> 00:39:20,970
Who's he?

767
00:39:20,975 --> 00:39:24,315
He's Kang Dong Gu, the production assistant.

768
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,685
- Hello. - Nice to meet you.

769
00:39:28,583 --> 00:39:30,525
- Put your fist up. - All right.

770
00:39:31,919 --> 00:39:33,925
- Nice to meet you. - Let's get it.

771
00:39:34,322 --> 00:39:36,350
How's the music going?

772
00:39:36,357 --> 00:39:38,295
It's okay.

773
00:39:38,693 --> 00:39:41,790
I heard that it's a spy movie in Dubai.

774
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:44,530
I've prepared some samples that fit the concept.

775
00:39:44,532 --> 00:39:46,435
Do you want to hear them?

776
00:39:46,501 --> 00:39:48,105
- Shall we? - Okay, let's get it.

777
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:57,715
Okay, let's get it.

778
00:40:12,226 --> 00:40:14,695
Dubai, Dubai, Dubai, Dubai

779
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:19,575
How do you like it?

780
00:40:20,301 --> 00:40:24,305
Isn't this Psy's "Champion"?

781
00:40:24,539 --> 00:40:26,315
I think you just changed the lyrics.

782
00:40:27,742 --> 00:40:30,145
What the... What did you say?

783
00:40:30,244 --> 00:40:32,780
Are you suggesting that I plagiarized?

784
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:35,725
No, I just think it's similar.

785
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:37,850
Oh, my gosh.

786
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:41,420
Do you think it sounds like Psy's "Champion", Director?

787
00:40:41,422 --> 00:40:44,125
No, it's totally different.

788
00:40:44,725 --> 00:40:46,435
He doesn't know music.

789
00:40:46,494 --> 00:40:47,860
Don't mind him.

790
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:50,130
Then I'll show you the next song.

791
00:40:50,131 --> 00:40:51,305
Okay.

792
00:40:56,971 --> 00:40:59,775
I never knew, but I knew

793
00:41:03,244 --> 00:41:04,710
Dubai

794
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,540
I didn't know well

795
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:09,455
But don't send me to Dubai

796
00:41:13,921 --> 00:41:15,750
Why's your expression like that?

797
00:41:15,756 --> 00:41:16,925
Well,

798
00:41:17,091 --> 00:41:20,935
I think this one sounds a lot like Big Bang's "Lie".

799
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:24,490
What are you talking about? It's totally different.

800
00:41:24,499 --> 00:41:26,735
- What's wrong with you? - Well,

801
00:41:27,502 --> 00:41:29,275
I thought that the rhythms were similar.

802
00:41:29,804 --> 00:41:32,030
You're pickier than I thought. All right.

803
00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:34,900
I'll give you something you've never heard of.

804
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:38,485
I wanted to change my style from traditional rapping.

805
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,655
I'll let you listen to it.

806
00:42:00,167 --> 00:42:02,675
What? Have you heard of this too?

807
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,815
Well, no. No.

808
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:09,915
It's nice and new.

809
00:42:10,845 --> 00:42:13,055
Yes, it's good.

810
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,415
We'll use this one.

811
00:42:16,817 --> 00:42:18,525
- Okay, let's get it. - All right.

812
00:42:18,653 --> 00:42:21,580
I'll work on it a bit more, and we'll discuss it more later.

813
00:42:21,589 --> 00:42:22,795
Okay.

814
00:42:24,926 --> 00:42:26,865
I went to Dubai

815
00:42:27,595 --> 00:42:28,765
I already memorized it.

816
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:35,075
In this scene, Hae Na suddenly visits Jun Seok's house.

817
00:42:35,403 --> 00:42:37,900
You need to look at him for a few seconds...

818
00:42:37,905 --> 00:42:40,775
with watery eyes and then kiss him suddenly.

819
00:42:41,242 --> 00:42:42,815
- Do you understand? - Yes.

820
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:44,170
We'll start shooting then.

821
00:42:44,178 --> 00:42:46,055
- Let's make it as real as possible. - Okay.

822
00:42:46,847 --> 00:42:48,055
We're shooting.

823
00:42:49,183 --> 00:42:51,750
Get ready. Action!

824
00:42:51,752 --> 00:42:52,925
Who is it?

825
00:42:54,755 --> 00:42:57,125
Hae Na, what brings you here?

826
00:42:57,425 --> 00:42:58,595
Jun Seok.

827
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,195
Come inside. We can talk inside.

828
00:43:11,806 --> 00:43:12,940
- Oh, my. - Gosh.

829
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:14,070
Are you all right?

830
00:43:14,075 --> 00:43:15,640
What are you doing?

831
00:43:15,643 --> 00:43:16,885
I'm sorry, sir.

832
00:43:16,978 --> 00:43:19,715
- Are you all right, Jun Ki? - I'm okay.

833
00:43:26,087 --> 00:43:27,180
Cindy?

834
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:30,125
What's that? Cindy? Is he...

835
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:32,620
We'll start the kissing scene again.

836
00:43:32,627 --> 00:43:34,295
All right.

837
00:43:35,096 --> 00:43:37,805
Get ready. Action!

838
00:43:42,336 --> 00:43:43,575
- Are you all right? - Gosh!

839
00:43:44,171 --> 00:43:45,530
Cut. What's wrong?

840
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:49,145
- Jun Ki. Jun Ki, are you all right? - Yes.

841
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:51,210
Are you out of your minds?

842
00:43:51,212 --> 00:43:53,115
What's wrong with everyone today?

843
00:43:53,147 --> 00:43:54,915
Gosh, what's wrong so suddenly?

844
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:56,780
I'm sorry, Jun Ki.

845
00:43:56,784 --> 00:43:58,755
It's okay.

846
00:44:03,658 --> 00:44:05,295
Cindy?

847
00:44:05,526 --> 00:44:07,435
Is he also...

848
00:44:08,629 --> 00:44:09,965
Are you all right?

849
00:44:11,499 --> 00:44:14,200
Yes, I'm fine.

850
00:44:14,201 --> 00:44:16,945
We'll take a break until we have the light set up again.

851
00:44:17,104 --> 00:44:18,875
- Take a break, Jun Ki. - Yes.

852
00:44:22,777 --> 00:44:25,985
Something's not right. Something's going wrong.

853
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:27,915
Jun Ki, are you all right?

854
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:29,350
Something's wrong.

855
00:44:29,350 --> 00:44:32,820
I think all the staff members are Cindy's fans.

856
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:34,320
Gosh, are you talking about that again?

857
00:44:34,321 --> 00:44:36,820
It's not like that. I'm sure there's something.

858
00:44:36,824 --> 00:44:38,965
Calm down and drink this.

859
00:44:40,327 --> 00:44:41,495
Thanks.

860
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:50,275
What's wrong with this?

861
00:44:53,074 --> 00:44:56,015
Hey, the expiry date was a year ago.

862
00:44:56,544 --> 00:44:58,985
Really? I'm sorry.

863
00:44:59,313 --> 00:45:00,780
I just bought it from the shop.

864
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:02,485
Gosh, it's fine.

865
00:45:02,917 --> 00:45:05,880
Hey, I don't have anything to do on Sunday, right?

866
00:45:05,886 --> 00:45:07,955
I have an important appointment.

867
00:45:08,055 --> 00:45:09,120
- Sunday? - Yes.

868
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:10,295
Just wait a moment.

869
00:45:10,858 --> 00:45:12,265
Sunday.

870
00:45:14,261 --> 00:45:15,860
(My Love Cindy)

871
00:45:15,863 --> 00:45:19,705
Cindy? My manager is... He's also...

872
00:45:20,234 --> 00:45:23,205
- What's wrong? - It's nothing.

873
00:45:23,838 --> 00:45:26,340
Are you all right? Do you want some coffee to wake you up?

874
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:28,445
No! I'll never drink that!

875
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:29,815
Why are you getting angry?

876
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:37,585
Jun Ki!

877
00:45:46,227 --> 00:45:47,865
This is it.

878
00:45:48,095 --> 00:45:50,365
Park Seo Jun is my style,

879
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:52,875
not Du Shik.

880
00:45:53,067 --> 00:45:54,305
How can he be?

881
00:45:56,403 --> 00:45:58,405
He's so handsome.

882
00:46:11,786 --> 00:46:13,095
What's wrong?

883
00:46:13,487 --> 00:46:15,595
You're out of your mind. Gosh.

884
00:46:16,056 --> 00:46:17,725
Min Soo Ah, you must be crazy.

885
00:46:19,226 --> 00:46:20,365
- What are you doing? - Gosh.

886
00:46:21,595 --> 00:46:24,665
Why do you care what I do, you pig?

887
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:27,400
You're calling me pig again. Hey!

888
00:46:27,401 --> 00:46:28,730
Why am I a pig?

889
00:46:28,736 --> 00:46:30,105
You stupid, dumb sea animal!

890
00:46:30,171 --> 00:46:32,305
She must be a psychopath. She's crazy.

891
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:34,215
Gosh, Jun Ki.

892
00:46:35,409 --> 00:46:36,570
Why are you so pale?

893
00:46:36,577 --> 00:46:38,985
Du Shik, I'm so scared.

894
00:46:40,181 --> 00:46:42,315
She must be a psychopath. She's crazy.

895
00:46:42,349 --> 00:46:43,685
Gosh, Jun Ki.

896
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:46,050
Why are you so pale?

897
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:48,450
Du Shik, I'm so scared.

898
00:46:48,455 --> 00:46:50,095
What are you afraid of?

899
00:46:51,458 --> 00:46:54,695
What? You think Cindy's fans are terrorizing you?

900
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:57,460
Yes. Every time something weird happens,

901
00:46:57,464 --> 00:46:58,860
it involves her fans.

902
00:46:58,866 --> 00:47:01,330
I think they're revenging on me...

903
00:47:01,335 --> 00:47:03,330
now that we are in love.

904
00:47:03,337 --> 00:47:04,675
Does that make sense?

905
00:47:04,772 --> 00:47:06,140
You're paranoid.

906
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:09,485
It's not that! I'm certain something's going on!

907
00:47:09,543 --> 00:47:11,515
You should just go to bed and get some sleep.

908
00:47:11,612 --> 00:47:13,755
- You're just tired. - Really?

909
00:47:14,582 --> 00:47:15,855
Maybe that's it.

910
00:47:16,217 --> 00:47:18,625
- It's get better when I rest. - You should go and rest.

911
00:47:20,054 --> 00:47:21,225
All right.

912
00:47:23,123 --> 00:47:25,690
Gosh, it's so dangerous. It's dangerous outside this room.

913
00:47:25,693 --> 00:47:26,965
It's dangerous.

914
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,800
(I'll kill you, Jun Ki. Cindy is mine. Get away from her.)

915
00:47:34,802 --> 00:47:37,345
Jun Ki, what's wrong?

916
00:47:38,606 --> 00:47:41,770
Look at this. Cindy's fans are blackmailing me.

917
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:43,915
Someone must have been in here.

918
00:47:45,045 --> 00:47:47,555
I can't be safe even in my own bed.

919
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:51,425
Jun Ki, where are you going?

920
00:47:51,719 --> 00:47:52,925
What's with him?

921
00:47:58,225 --> 00:48:00,865
(Stay away from Cindy, or you'll be dead meat.)

922
00:48:11,071 --> 00:48:13,875
(My Love, Cindy)

923
00:48:20,814 --> 00:48:21,985
What are you doing?

924
00:48:22,850 --> 00:48:24,725
I bought some sundae for you.

925
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:26,525
Thank you.

926
00:48:32,126 --> 00:48:34,635
Are you still depressed about the exam?

927
00:48:35,429 --> 00:48:36,535
No.

928
00:48:37,131 --> 00:48:38,990
You have a lot of work these days, right?

929
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:42,230
Yes. I'm leaving for Dubai in a week.

930
00:48:42,236 --> 00:48:43,745
I have a lot to prepare.

931
00:48:43,871 --> 00:48:45,730
You'll be away for a month, right?

932
00:48:45,739 --> 00:48:46,815
Yes.

933
00:48:47,808 --> 00:48:51,245
I'll miss you and Sol so much.

934
00:48:51,378 --> 00:48:52,410
Should I just not go?

935
00:48:52,413 --> 00:48:54,685
Don't be silly.

936
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:57,110
I hope you'll have a safe trip.

937
00:48:57,117 --> 00:48:58,255
I mean,

938
00:48:58,285 --> 00:49:01,325
I'm worried I'll fall for another girl.

939
00:49:06,093 --> 00:49:08,860
I'm just joking to make you laugh.

940
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:09,965
I'm sorry.

941
00:49:11,732 --> 00:49:14,275
I met someone really funny today. Do you want to hear?

942
00:49:14,902 --> 00:49:16,200
Who did you meet?

943
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:19,340
I met the rapper who is working on our sound track.

944
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:22,815
But all his songs sounded so familiar.

945
00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:26,140
He copied Psy, Big Bang, and iKon's songs.

946
00:49:26,146 --> 00:49:28,855
All he did was change lyrics.

947
00:49:29,316 --> 00:49:30,425
Really?

948
00:49:30,451 --> 00:49:32,355
What was his name?

949
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,595
MC Dacopy?

950
00:49:35,255 --> 00:49:36,750
Oh, is he called Dacopy...

951
00:49:36,757 --> 00:49:38,565
because he copies songs?

952
00:49:39,026 --> 00:49:40,590
MC Dacopy?

953
00:49:40,594 --> 00:49:42,360
What? You've heard of him?

954
00:49:42,363 --> 00:49:45,530
Of course. He's my favorite rapper.

955
00:49:45,532 --> 00:49:49,545
He's the one who inspired me to dream of becoming a rapper.

956
00:49:50,204 --> 00:49:51,345
Really?

957
00:49:51,638 --> 00:49:53,915
It's my dream to meet him.

958
00:49:54,208 --> 00:49:56,185
Do you want me to introduce you to him?

959
00:49:56,477 --> 00:49:59,885
Really? That'd be so fantastic.

960
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:02,555
My goodness. You're finally smiling.

961
00:50:02,616 --> 00:50:03,850
Are you that happy?

962
00:50:03,851 --> 00:50:05,525
Yes, I'm so happy.

963
00:50:06,153 --> 00:50:08,850
Thank you so much. I appreciate it.

964
00:50:08,856 --> 00:50:09,995
My goodness.

965
00:50:12,726 --> 00:50:13,895
I can't believe it.

966
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:17,490
- Hi. - Hi.

967
00:50:17,498 --> 00:50:19,135
Hi.

968
00:50:19,867 --> 00:50:21,405
Jun Ki, you're here.

969
00:50:21,902 --> 00:50:24,675
You must be tired. Do you want some coffee?

970
00:50:25,005 --> 00:50:26,645
Sure. Thanks.

971
00:50:43,323 --> 00:50:45,765
I don't want to drink it. No!

972
00:50:56,970 --> 00:50:58,745
Why are you eating alone?

973
00:50:58,906 --> 00:50:59,975
Let me join you.

974
00:51:01,642 --> 00:51:03,245
I'm okay.

975
00:51:03,577 --> 00:51:05,585
You have rice on your face.

976
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:27,075
Give it to me.

977
00:51:27,134 --> 00:51:29,375
I'm saving it for when I'm drunk later.

978
00:51:29,803 --> 00:51:30,975
Don't touch it!

979
00:51:46,253 --> 00:51:47,625
Gosh.

980
00:51:48,455 --> 00:51:49,565
Cindy...

981
00:51:50,290 --> 00:51:52,090
You startled me.

982
00:51:52,092 --> 00:51:55,295
Are you angry with me for something?

983
00:51:56,997 --> 00:51:58,235
No.

984
00:51:58,265 --> 00:52:00,175
Then why are you avoiding me?

985
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:03,175
You don't talk to me, and you ignore me when I say hi.

986
00:52:04,438 --> 00:52:06,540
Did I do something wrong?

987
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,500
No, that's not it.

988
00:52:08,509 --> 00:52:10,745
Tell me if I did something wrong.

989
00:52:11,278 --> 00:52:13,915
I'll try to change. Please.

990
00:52:18,919 --> 00:52:20,225
Are you crying?

991
00:52:22,990 --> 00:52:24,865
The thing is...

992
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:27,520
What's wrong?

993
00:52:27,528 --> 00:52:29,395
I think something went in my eye.

994
00:52:29,897 --> 00:52:32,765
Really? Let me see.

995
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:48,815
Done. I've updated all our new products.

996
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:50,180
I'm so tired.

997
00:52:50,184 --> 00:52:52,180
What is Soo Ah doing? Why are you doing all the work?

998
00:52:52,186 --> 00:52:54,880
I don't know. She's so mean.

999
00:52:54,888 --> 00:52:57,565
She never does any work, and she calls me a pig.

1000
00:52:57,624 --> 00:52:58,925
She's weird.

1001
00:52:59,326 --> 00:53:01,060
She's never been normal.

1002
00:53:01,061 --> 00:53:02,265
That's right.

1003
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:04,690
Now that I'm finished,

1004
00:53:04,698 --> 00:53:07,230
I'll play with the number of viewers...

1005
00:53:07,234 --> 00:53:09,275
for "President Is Bruce Lee" a bit.

1006
00:53:11,905 --> 00:53:14,815
Hold on. "Lee Jun Ki" is the most searched word right now.

1007
00:53:15,776 --> 00:53:17,815
Do you think it's the Lee Jun Ki we know?

1008
00:53:21,515 --> 00:53:22,580
What's that?

1009
00:53:22,583 --> 00:53:24,310
"Cindy and Lee Jun Ki are dating."

1010
00:53:24,318 --> 00:53:25,655
"A secret date"?

1011
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:29,180
What? What are you talking about?

1012
00:53:29,189 --> 00:53:30,295
Well...

1013
00:53:30,991 --> 00:53:33,190
(Cindy And Lee Jun Ki's Secret Date)

1014
00:53:33,193 --> 00:53:34,535
What's that?

1015
00:53:35,062 --> 00:53:38,205
I don't know. What's going on?

1016
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:41,475
I'm back.

1017
00:53:42,169 --> 00:53:43,375
What are you guys doing?

1018
00:53:43,937 --> 00:53:46,270
Did you find something interesting? I want to see it too.

1019
00:53:46,273 --> 00:53:48,375
I want to see it.

1020
00:53:50,911 --> 00:53:52,980
Wait. What is this?

1021
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:54,885
What's going on?

1022
00:53:55,082 --> 00:53:56,725
Did you kiss Cindy?

1023
00:53:57,684 --> 00:53:59,955
No. What are you talking about?

1024
00:54:00,053 --> 00:54:01,920
It's not true.

1025
00:54:01,922 --> 00:54:03,490
It's just a misunderstanding.

1026
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:04,920
What's this picture then?

1027
00:54:04,925 --> 00:54:07,720
Well... She had something in her eye,

1028
00:54:07,728 --> 00:54:09,705
so I was blowing it out.

1029
00:54:09,896 --> 00:54:11,335
It's true.

1030
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:13,705
Seo Jin, you trust me, don't you?

1031
00:54:14,101 --> 00:54:16,035
Is that right?

1032
00:54:17,304 --> 00:54:18,805
I knew it.

1033
00:54:19,306 --> 00:54:20,715
Gosh.

1034
00:54:20,874 --> 00:54:22,740
Who wrote this article?

1035
00:54:22,743 --> 00:54:24,610
Seo Jin, don't worry.

1036
00:54:24,611 --> 00:54:27,410
I'll make sure a correction is published right away.

1037
00:54:27,414 --> 00:54:28,485
Okay.

1038
00:54:38,625 --> 00:54:39,735
(CEO)

1039
00:54:45,499 --> 00:54:48,305
Hello. Have you seen the article?

1040
00:54:48,835 --> 00:54:50,745
It's a misunderstanding.

1041
00:54:50,837 --> 00:54:52,675
Nothing is going on between Cindy and me.

1042
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,945
We should publish a correction right away.

1043
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:56,145
"A correction"?

1044
00:54:56,810 --> 00:54:58,510
Why? Just leave it.

1045
00:54:58,512 --> 00:55:00,980
What? What are you...

1046
00:55:00,981 --> 00:55:03,310
Jun Ki. Who is Cindy?

1047
00:55:03,317 --> 00:55:05,785
She's the nation's little sister.

1048
00:55:05,919 --> 00:55:08,520
A scandal with Cindy will make you famous...

1049
00:55:08,522 --> 00:55:11,990
and bring you a ton of media coverage.

1050
00:55:11,992 --> 00:55:13,965
Still...

1051
00:55:14,828 --> 00:55:17,065
Stay quiet for the time being.

1052
00:55:17,164 --> 00:55:19,730
I'll make a comment at an appropriate time. Okay?

1053
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:20,905
Well...

1054
00:55:21,535 --> 00:55:22,735
Sir?

1055
00:55:25,205 --> 00:55:26,615
It's driving me crazy.

1056
00:55:30,210 --> 00:55:31,585
Well...

1057
00:55:31,645 --> 00:55:32,710
(Lee Jun Ki and Cindy dating)

1058
00:55:32,713 --> 00:55:34,385
He's still on top.

1059
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:36,525
More articles are coming out every second.

1060
00:55:38,518 --> 00:55:40,925
What did he say? Will they publish a correction?

1061
00:55:41,388 --> 00:55:42,625
Well...

1062
00:55:42,823 --> 00:55:45,695
The CEO wants to wait.

1063
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:47,490
- What? - Well...

1064
00:55:47,494 --> 00:55:51,265
He thinks the rumor will make me famous.

1065
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:54,035
He wants me to stay quiet.

1066
00:55:55,335 --> 00:55:56,845
Gosh, it's driving me crazy.

1067
00:55:58,171 --> 00:55:59,275
Is that so?

1068
00:55:59,873 --> 00:56:01,815
What can you do?

1069
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:05,140
I'm okay. Don't worry.

1070
00:56:05,145 --> 00:56:07,555
Jun Ki, this is not okay.

1071
00:56:07,914 --> 00:56:10,085
How would Seo Jin feel?

1072
00:56:10,317 --> 00:56:12,550
She can't tell people you're his boyfriend,

1073
00:56:12,552 --> 00:56:14,280
and she even has to put up with your dating rumors.

1074
00:56:14,287 --> 00:56:15,555
Isn't that too much?

1075
00:56:15,689 --> 00:56:18,325
Seo Jin, I'm sorry.

1076
00:56:18,925 --> 00:56:20,160
I really am.

1077
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,260
Don't worry.

1078
00:56:21,261 --> 00:56:23,265
It's not your fault.

1079
00:56:23,830 --> 00:56:26,290
By the way, when you hugged Cindy in the drama,

1080
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:27,760
her fans went crazy.

1081
00:56:27,768 --> 00:56:30,400
With the rumors spreading, won't they try to...

1082
00:56:30,404 --> 00:56:31,805
kill you?

1083
00:56:32,105 --> 00:56:34,515
Right. I'm in trouble.

1084
00:56:34,908 --> 00:56:36,710
And we're celebrating Seo Jin's birthday tomorrow.

1085
00:56:36,710 --> 00:56:38,910
We can celebrate at home.

1086
00:56:38,912 --> 00:56:41,515
I've already booked a place.

1087
00:56:41,715 --> 00:56:44,885
And we can't just stay home on your birthday.

1088
00:56:45,252 --> 00:56:47,250
I'll figure it out.

1089
00:56:47,254 --> 00:56:49,995
We are going on a date tomorrow, okay?

1090
00:56:50,290 --> 00:56:51,925
Okay.

1091
00:56:55,162 --> 00:56:57,505
Unbelievable.

1092
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:00,805
Let's get it.

1093
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:04,175
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1094
00:57:04,905 --> 00:57:06,770
Thank you for making time.

1095
00:57:06,773 --> 00:57:08,245
You're welcome.

1096
00:57:08,742 --> 00:57:11,770
I had no idea your girlfriend...

1097
00:57:11,778 --> 00:57:13,585
was my fan.

1098
00:57:13,713 --> 00:57:15,415
Neither did I.

1099
00:57:16,116 --> 00:57:19,350
Your music inspired me to dream of...

1100
00:57:19,352 --> 00:57:21,225
becoming a rapper.

1101
00:57:21,655 --> 00:57:23,095
But I've given up.

1102
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:24,350
Really?

1103
00:57:24,357 --> 00:57:26,265
You dreamed of becoming a rapper?

1104
00:57:27,761 --> 00:57:28,835
Let's get it.

1105
00:57:34,134 --> 00:57:36,830
Now that you're here,

1106
00:57:36,837 --> 00:57:38,745
why don't you try recording something?

1107
00:57:39,639 --> 00:57:41,975
- Really? - Of course.

1108
00:57:42,075 --> 00:57:43,285
Give it a try.

1109
00:57:43,610 --> 00:57:45,615
It'll be a good time. It would be memorable.

1110
00:57:45,645 --> 00:57:47,085
Which song would you like to sing?

1111
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:50,150
Your main song...

1112
00:57:50,150 --> 00:57:53,395
"Mapo Bridge" is my favorite. May I sing it once?

1113
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:54,655
Sure, why not?

1114
00:57:54,754 --> 00:57:56,080
Go to the recording room. Let's get it.

1115
00:57:56,089 --> 00:57:57,195
Okay.

1116
00:58:01,962 --> 00:58:04,690
Yoon Ah, let's get started.

1117
00:58:04,698 --> 00:58:06,405
- Don't be nervous. - Okay.

1118
00:58:06,433 --> 00:58:07,975
Okay, let's get it.

1119
00:58:14,474 --> 00:58:17,745
It's the same as "Yanghwa Bridge" by Zion.T.

1120
00:58:17,878 --> 00:58:21,185
I can't believe this. Unbelievable.

1121
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:32,990
I was always alone at my home

1122
00:58:32,993 --> 00:58:35,735
Mother was a bus driver

1123
00:58:35,795 --> 00:58:38,060
When I asked her where she was

1124
00:58:38,064 --> 00:58:40,005
It was always Mapo Bridge

1125
00:58:40,567 --> 00:58:43,105
Let's be happy

1126
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:45,645
Let's be happy

1127
00:58:46,106 --> 00:58:47,975
Don't be sad

1128
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:50,585
Don't be sad

1129
00:58:51,578 --> 00:58:52,845
Wait, Yoon Ah.

1130
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:54,380
Yes, what is it?

1131
00:58:54,381 --> 00:58:56,415
Your singing reminds me...

1132
00:58:56,750 --> 00:58:58,485
of Zion.T.

1133
00:58:58,919 --> 00:59:01,925
You seem confused with "Yanghwa Bridge" by Zion.T.

1134
00:59:02,188 --> 00:59:04,650
This is my song, "Mapo Bridge".

1135
00:59:04,658 --> 00:59:06,760
It's not "Yanghwa Bridge". You know what I'm saying?

1136
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:08,695
Yes, I'm sorry.

1137
00:59:09,229 --> 00:59:12,365
Don't ever sing like Zion.T, okay?

1138
00:59:12,666 --> 00:59:14,605
- Okay. - Let's start again.

1139
00:59:14,734 --> 00:59:15,905
Let's get it.

1140
00:59:27,314 --> 00:59:30,210
I was always alone at my home

1141
00:59:30,216 --> 00:59:32,910
Mother was a bus driver

1142
00:59:32,919 --> 00:59:35,280
When I asked her where she was

1143
00:59:35,288 --> 00:59:37,125
It was always Mapo Bridge

1144
00:59:37,757 --> 00:59:40,120
Let's be happy

1145
00:59:40,126 --> 00:59:41,295
Stop it, stop it.

1146
00:59:42,596 --> 00:59:45,005
You sound like Zion.T again.

1147
00:59:45,231 --> 00:59:48,200
This song is completely different.

1148
00:59:48,201 --> 00:59:49,635
Why do you keep getting confused?

1149
00:59:50,070 --> 00:59:51,900
Yanghwa Bridge and Mapo Bridge...

1150
00:59:51,905 --> 00:59:54,445
are at least over 1km apart.

1151
00:59:54,874 --> 00:59:58,415
There's Seogang Bridge in between. How are you confused? I mean...

1152
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:02,955
Be happy... No.

1153
01:00:04,150 --> 01:00:06,325
Let's be happy

1154
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:08,755
Let's be happy

1155
01:00:08,955 --> 01:00:11,065
Is this so hard?

1156
01:00:11,291 --> 01:00:12,625
I'm sorry.

1157
01:00:14,995 --> 01:00:17,330
Let's do it one last time.

1158
01:00:17,330 --> 01:00:18,505
Okay.

1159
01:00:26,506 --> 01:00:28,015
Gosh, Bacca.

1160
01:00:28,808 --> 01:00:32,045
- You look so pretty today. - Really?

1161
01:00:32,512 --> 01:00:34,785
We haven't gone on a date in a while, so I dressed up.

1162
01:00:34,914 --> 01:00:37,285
- Do I look okay? - Yes, you look beautiful.

1163
01:00:38,652 --> 01:00:40,425
- Shall we go? - Okay.

1164
01:00:40,687 --> 01:00:42,595
I almost forgot. Wait.

1165
01:00:45,692 --> 01:00:48,620
- What are you doing? - In case reporters catch me,

1166
01:00:48,628 --> 01:00:51,405
the president told me to go outside like this.

1167
01:00:52,565 --> 01:00:53,660
Really?

1168
01:00:53,667 --> 01:00:55,735
Okay, let's go.

1169
01:00:56,336 --> 01:00:57,505
Let's go.

1170
01:01:02,108 --> 01:01:03,375
Welcome.

1171
01:01:05,812 --> 01:01:07,085
Do you have reservations?

1172
01:01:08,348 --> 01:01:10,555
- Chewbacca. - Please go that way.

1173
01:01:18,058 --> 01:01:19,165
Wait just a moment.

1174
01:01:19,793 --> 01:01:20,895
Here.

1175
01:01:22,796 --> 01:01:24,265
The chair is going in.

1176
01:01:32,138 --> 01:01:33,275
Thank you.

1177
01:01:33,306 --> 01:01:36,140
Anyway, will you keep those on?

1178
01:01:36,142 --> 01:01:37,315
What do you mean?

1179
01:01:38,845 --> 01:01:40,615
Oh, I should take these off.

1180
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:44,680
You should order, Seo Jin.

1181
01:01:44,684 --> 01:01:47,380
I'll buy you everything that you want today.

1182
01:01:47,387 --> 01:01:49,595
Really? I'm so excited.

1183
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:51,525
What shall I eat?

1184
01:01:52,058 --> 01:01:54,565
Yes, I just arrived.

1185
01:01:54,728 --> 01:01:57,535
The interview just ended. Yes.

1186
01:01:58,064 --> 01:01:59,405
Which room was it?

1187
01:01:59,632 --> 01:02:01,275
On the right? Okay.

1188
01:02:03,036 --> 01:02:05,745
Gosh, I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

1189
01:02:06,172 --> 01:02:07,345
It's okay.

1190
01:02:12,345 --> 01:02:15,015
What shall we eat? How about this?

1191
01:02:20,053 --> 01:02:21,225
Let's see.

1192
01:02:21,788 --> 01:02:23,665
Sirloin? Tenderloin?

1193
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:25,925
Seo Jin, decide what you want.

1194
01:02:25,959 --> 01:02:28,195
- I'm going to the restroom. - Okay, go ahead.

1195
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:30,305
Sirloin?

1196
01:02:43,676 --> 01:02:44,845
Pardon me.

1197
01:02:45,912 --> 01:02:47,455
You're Lee Jun Ki, right?

1198
01:02:47,881 --> 01:02:49,910
No, you're mistaken.

1199
01:02:49,916 --> 01:02:51,750
Come on, you are Lee Jun Ki.

1200
01:02:51,751 --> 01:02:53,825
I saw you sitting in the room.

1201
01:02:54,087 --> 01:02:57,625
Mr. Lee, could you say something about your romantic life?

1202
01:02:57,690 --> 01:02:58,750
Do you admit it?

1203
01:02:58,758 --> 01:03:00,320
- I'm not Lee Jun Ki. - Come on.

1204
01:03:00,326 --> 01:03:03,860
Then why don't you lower your mask a bit?

1205
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:05,760
I'll let you go if you aren't him. Show me a little.

1206
01:03:05,765 --> 01:03:07,600
- Lower it a little. - Goodness.

1207
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:10,000
- Wait, Mr. Lee Jun Ki. - Gosh.

1208
01:03:10,003 --> 01:03:12,545
Wait, Mr. Lee Jun Ki!

1209
01:03:17,911 --> 01:03:19,945
Why isn't he back yet?

1210
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:22,955
(Jun Ki)

1211
01:03:23,082 --> 01:03:25,725
It's him. What's going on?

1212
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:29,955
Jun Ki, why aren't you back yet?

1213
01:03:30,089 --> 01:03:32,765
Seo Jin, a reporter is chasing me.

1214
01:03:33,193 --> 01:03:36,295
I can't go back to the restaurant. What should I do?

1215
01:03:36,629 --> 01:03:37,805
What?

1216
01:03:37,831 --> 01:03:39,005
I'm really sorry.

1217
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:43,375
Gosh, she's still chasing me.

1218
01:03:43,603 --> 01:03:46,045
See you later at home. I'm sorry.

1219
01:04:22,208 --> 01:04:23,615
Seo Jin, you're home.

1220
01:04:24,310 --> 01:04:26,345
I'm sorry about what happened.

1221
01:04:26,713 --> 01:04:28,855
A reporter was waiting for me in the hallway.

1222
01:04:29,382 --> 01:04:33,425
She asked me if the rumor was true. I couldn't help but run away.

1223
01:04:34,721 --> 01:04:36,555
I'm really sorry.

1224
01:04:38,992 --> 01:04:42,935
Seo Jin, I'm really sorry.

1225
01:04:46,733 --> 01:04:48,635
I have something to say.

1226
01:04:48,701 --> 01:04:51,045
You do? What is it?

1227
01:04:52,538 --> 01:04:54,415
Let's take some time to think.

1228
01:04:56,042 --> 01:04:57,245
What?

1229
01:04:58,711 --> 01:05:00,915
"Take some time to think"?

1230
01:05:02,482 --> 01:05:03,825
What do you mean by that?

1231
01:05:04,651 --> 01:05:05,925
I mean...

1232
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:09,895
we should reconsider our relationship.

1233
01:05:11,658 --> 01:05:12,825
What?

1234
01:05:15,361 --> 01:05:17,605
What's wrong with him?

1235
01:05:17,630 --> 01:05:20,435
"Yanghwa Bridge" and "Mapo Bridge" sound the same.

1236
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:24,145
He's the one who copied the song. Why did he take it out on you?

1237
01:05:25,972 --> 01:05:28,000
Yoon Ah, cheer up.

1238
01:05:28,007 --> 01:05:29,615
He was the one who was acting strange.

1239
01:05:30,343 --> 01:05:32,085
It's okay.

1240
01:05:32,812 --> 01:05:35,255
I gave up on being a rapper anyway.

1241
01:05:38,318 --> 01:05:39,725
Dong Gu.

1242
01:05:41,988 --> 01:05:44,325
Why can't I do anything well?

1243
01:05:44,958 --> 01:05:48,035
I can neither bake nor rap.

1244
01:05:48,428 --> 01:05:49,535
Come on.

1245
01:05:50,630 --> 01:05:52,965
Don't think so negatively.

1246
01:05:53,099 --> 01:05:54,275
I'm sorry.

1247
01:05:55,101 --> 01:05:58,145
I know that you're trying to cheer me up,

1248
01:05:59,072 --> 01:06:00,475
but I can't cheer up.

1249
01:06:03,409 --> 01:06:05,585
You can't do this anymore.

1250
01:06:06,012 --> 01:06:09,515
Yoon Ah, I prepared something for you.

1251
01:06:10,350 --> 01:06:11,525
What is it?

1252
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:16,455
Yes, get it

1253
01:06:17,090 --> 01:06:20,635
The first wound stays in the heart, the tears fall

1254
01:06:20,660 --> 01:06:22,160
Even if you're lonely or sad

1255
01:06:22,161 --> 01:06:23,520
Don't cry

1256
01:06:23,529 --> 01:06:24,905
My dear Yoon Ah

1257
01:06:25,331 --> 01:06:28,100
What are you doing, Dong Gu?

1258
01:06:28,101 --> 01:06:30,260
Look at my eyes

1259
01:06:30,269 --> 01:06:31,430
Forget about MC Dacopy

1260
01:06:31,437 --> 01:06:34,200
Erase everything, and run

1261
01:06:34,207 --> 01:06:36,100
Run toward your dream, just go

1262
01:06:36,109 --> 01:06:37,285
Where?

1263
01:06:39,379 --> 01:06:41,040
Let me start over. Again.

1264
01:06:41,047 --> 01:06:42,455
Just Go

1265
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:47,320
You're laughing, right?

1266
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:48,795
Then you're feeling better, right?

1267
01:06:51,391 --> 01:06:54,235
It sure is hard to cheer you up.

1268
01:06:54,460 --> 01:06:55,860
Gosh. That was embarrassing.

1269
01:06:55,862 --> 01:06:58,065
Why? You're a good rapper.

1270
01:06:59,499 --> 01:07:00,975
I could never be as good as you.

1271
01:07:01,067 --> 01:07:04,005
Gosh, Sol. What do you think about my rap skills?

1272
01:07:07,807 --> 01:07:10,685
(Ms. Han Yoon Ah, Congratulations. You've passed the test.)

1273
01:07:11,411 --> 01:07:12,785
Why? What is it?

1274
01:07:12,879 --> 01:07:14,515
I passed the test.

1275
01:07:15,081 --> 01:07:17,750
I passed the baking license test.

1276
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:18,925
Really?

1277
01:07:20,820 --> 01:07:24,190
You see? What did I tell you? I told you you'd pass the test.

1278
01:07:24,190 --> 01:07:25,465
Congratulations, Yoon Ah.

1279
01:07:25,691 --> 01:07:26,790
Thank you.

1280
01:07:26,793 --> 01:07:28,335
Wait a minute.

1281
01:07:28,528 --> 01:07:30,220
We should celebrate on a day like this.

1282
01:07:30,229 --> 01:07:31,405
Let's have a party.

1283
01:07:31,798 --> 01:07:34,135
Wait here for a minute. I'll go buy a cake, all right?

1284
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:35,435
Dong Gu.

1285
01:07:41,641 --> 01:07:42,775
Yoon Ah.

1286
01:08:05,898 --> 01:08:09,300
(Welcome to Waikiki)

1287
01:08:09,302 --> 01:08:11,430
What? Sol's father's here?

1288
01:08:11,437 --> 01:08:12,845
Why are you here?

1289
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:14,140
Daddy.

1290
01:08:14,140 --> 01:08:15,700
Blood really must be thicker than water.

1291
01:08:15,708 --> 01:08:18,410
I'd like to take care of Yoon Ah and Sol.

1292
01:08:18,411 --> 01:08:19,910
After all this time, you want to take care of them now?

1293
01:08:19,912 --> 01:08:21,540
I still love Yoon Ah.

1294
01:08:21,547 --> 01:08:23,680
This won't change anything.

1295
01:08:23,683 --> 01:08:25,550
But it won't change the fact that I'm Sol's father.

1296
01:08:25,551 --> 01:08:27,780
I want to ask you for your forgiveness. Is that wrong?

1297
01:08:27,787 --> 01:08:30,220
Why do I keep thinking of Du Shik? Why?

1298
01:08:30,223 --> 01:08:31,650
You're crazy, Soo Ah.

1299
01:08:31,657 --> 01:08:33,565
You've completely lost your mind.

1300
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:36,360
- My stomach. - What's wrong? Are you sick?

1301
01:08:36,362 --> 01:08:37,830
Is there a Bong Du Shik here?

1302
01:08:37,830 --> 01:08:40,675
I have something to say to you.

1303
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:43,035
I think I...

1304
01:08:43,169 --> 01:08:46,145
I thought I was a strong person, but I guess I'm not.

1305
01:08:46,372 --> 01:08:50,040
You mean you're going to let go of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity?

1306
01:08:50,042 --> 01:08:51,070
You should move out of there first.

1307
01:08:51,077 --> 01:08:54,080
- So? - I'm breaking up with Seo Jin.

1308
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:56,140
I'd like to tell you all the truth...

1309
01:08:56,149 --> 01:08:58,985
about the romance rumor between Cindy and myself.
