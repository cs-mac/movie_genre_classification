1
00:02:24,115 --> 00:02:28,347
¶So are we now
where Christ has led ¶

2
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:32,686
A-a-a-alleluia ¶

3
00:02:32,757 --> 00:02:36,887
¶ Following our exalted head ¶

¶ A-a-a-alleluia ¶

¶ Made like him
Like him we rise ¶

6
00:02:45,337 --> 00:02:49,467
¶ A-a-a-alleluia ¶

7
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:53,773
Ours across the great blue sky ¶

8
00:02:53,845 --> 00:03:01,911
¶ A-a-a-alleluia ¶

00:03:01,986 --> 00:03:04,250

11
00:03:10,462 --> 00:03:12,657
Nathanial.

12
00:03:12,731 --> 00:03:17,725
- This arrived for you this morning.
- Thank you, Headmaster.

13
00:03:17,802 --> 00:03:20,737
Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah--

14
00:03:20,805 --> 00:03:23,433
What sweet news!

15
00:03:23,508 --> 00:03:27,000
My dear daddy has arranged
for my immediate departure...

16
00:03:27,078 --> 00:03:29,672
from Stephenwood, tomorrow,
after graduation.

17
00:03:29,748 --> 00:03:34,014
And he's booked me first-class
passage on the Queen Catherine.

18
00:03:34,085 --> 00:03:35,450
Of course. Heaven forbid...

19
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,318
that you should experience
even the slightest discomfort.

20
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:40,415
Yes. Good point.

21
00:03:40,492 --> 00:03:43,757
- As I'm sure you're well aware,
Reichmaster Timmons,

22
00:03:43,828 --> 00:03:48,026
I'm to take over
the family-run hotel chain
in beautiful sun-drenched Hawaii.

23
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:52,365
I'm sure that's almost
as exciting as being a frustrated,
shabbily-dressed headmaster.

24
00:03:52,437 --> 00:03:54,871
- Yes? 
- Young Nathanial.

25
00:03:54,939 --> 00:03:59,069
The faculty and myself have made
endless attempts to teach you to curb...

26
00:03:59,144 --> 00:04:01,669
your condescensions
towards others.

27
00:04:01,746 --> 00:04:07,241
As a fancy lad,
respecting those around you is
both your duty and your obligation.

28
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:12,381
I'm sorry,, sir. I was just
pondering what drifter's corpse
you stole those shoes from.

29
00:04:12,457 --> 00:04:15,585
My God!

30
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,925
You are a hateful creature,
aren't you?

31
00:04:18,997 --> 00:04:21,397
Come on, it was just a joke.

32
00:04:24,569 --> 00:04:28,938
The origin of the bowler...
can be traced back...

33
00:04:29,007 --> 00:04:31,567
to the turn of the century.

34
00:04:31,643 --> 00:04:36,080
The simplest and most popular
way to tip... a hat...

35
00:04:36,147 --> 00:04:38,741
is the Chatman Street method.

36
00:04:38,817 --> 00:04:41,684
It is performed thusly.

37
00:04:48,393 --> 00:04:51,487
Nathanial!
You may sit down, Lawrence.

38
00:04:51,563 --> 00:04:55,659
It is unfair to ask you to continue in
the presence of this cackling baboon!

39
00:04:57,168 --> 00:05:02,470
Somebody's daddy's missing a leg!

40
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:06,499
Since you seem so anxious
to interrupt the proceedings
with your infantile babble,

41
00:05:06,578 --> 00:05:09,138
kindly step forward
and give us your presentation.

42
00:05:09,214 --> 00:05:12,706
It would my pleasure,
my dear underpaid professor.

43
00:05:15,119 --> 00:05:17,679
Excuse me.

44
00:05:17,755 --> 00:05:20,588
This, my silly, dim-witted
looking classmates,

45
00:05:20,658 --> 00:05:24,150
is a 14th century
Norwegian evening derby.

46
00:05:24,229 --> 00:05:28,598
Very few of these exist today,
and those that do reside in museums
or in the possession...

47
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:34,161
of extraordinarily rich young men who
happen to have rather large penises.

48
00:05:38,643 --> 00:05:41,874
Well...
good-bye, Nathanial.

49
00:05:41,946 --> 00:05:44,039
You are now officially
a fancy lad.

50
00:05:44,115 --> 00:05:48,916
And it is my sincere hope
that you will bring dignity
and humility to that high honor.

51
00:05:48,987 --> 00:05:53,549
Good luck. And do tell
your father I send my regards.

52
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:56,753
Sure. In fact,
I think I have the picture
of his backside in my wallet...

53
00:05:56,828 --> 00:05:59,092
if you care to kiss it
right here.

54
00:05:59,163 --> 00:06:01,927
Nathanial, whatever shall
become of you?

55
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,460
Don't worry, about me, Timmons.
My life shall never be anything
less than perfect.

56
00:06:06,538 --> 00:06:09,632
Hey! Here you go, Chubby.

57
00:06:09,707 --> 00:06:12,904
Go buy yourself a spritzer.

58
00:06:12,977 --> 00:06:17,277
Okay, come on. Let's get this
thing moving! And thank
you for opening the door for me.

59
00:06:17,348 --> 00:06:20,078
That was so nice,
you moron!

60
00:06:20,151 --> 00:06:25,384
Good riddance, you horrible,
dreadful, nasty little bastard.

61
00:06:25,456 --> 00:06:28,721
You're driving too fast.
Slow it down!

62
00:06:28,793 --> 00:06:32,559
Not that slow, imbecile. Speed up!

63
00:06:37,335 --> 00:06:40,793
Why on earth have you stopped
this wretched vehicle?
What do you think--

64
00:06:40,872 --> 00:06:44,865
- Get the hell outta here,
you fresh-mouthed little freak.
- Hey! Hey!

65
00:06:44,943 --> 00:06:48,071
What do you think you're doing?

66
00:06:50,515 --> 00:06:54,576
I merely suggested that
you have the driving ability
of a brain-dead laboratory, ape.

67
00:06:54,652 --> 00:06:58,645
- Welcome to the real world, kid.
- Well, fiine.

68
00:06:58,723 --> 00:07:01,749
I'll just get right back in.
I don't know what you--
Hey! Come back here, you!

69
00:07:01,826 --> 00:07:05,091
Hey! Hey!
You can't take my luggage!

70
00:07:05,163 --> 00:07:07,427
I'll have you incarcerated.

71
00:07:11,703 --> 00:07:13,728
Dear Lord,

72
00:07:13,805 --> 00:07:17,297
I'm about to embark
on a brisk walk,

73
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:21,038
the first bit of exercise
in my young privileged life.

74
00:07:21,112 --> 00:07:25,446
I pray, do not allow me
to break a sweat.

75
00:07:25,516 --> 00:07:28,576
Okay. Here I go.

76
00:07:28,653 --> 00:07:31,884
Yup.
One, two, I'm walking.

77
00:08:07,258 --> 00:08:10,022
The Golden Mist Seaport.

78
00:08:10,094 --> 00:08:13,723
Thank you. Thank--

79
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:18,161
Whoa-ho-ho. My luxurious suite
on the Queen Catherine awaits me.

80
00:08:18,232 --> 00:08:21,690
I'll be with you uno momento,
my friend.

81
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:43,686
Yes.
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

82
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:47,193
Finally. Okay.

83
00:08:47,261 --> 00:08:49,729
Watch it.
Watch--

84
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:52,390
Would you--
Lady! Eeew, yuck.

85
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:55,333
Eeew! Oooh!
Eeew. Eeew!

86
00:08:59,106 --> 00:09:02,098
Pardon me--

87
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:04,666
Get off me.

88
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:06,975
Geez.
Where are you--

89
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:09,345
Stop it! Stop.

90
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:12,579
I've had it with you
bunch of stinkos in here.

91
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:14,951
You, you, old man.

92
00:09:15,022 --> 00:09:17,889
Look, I am in desperate need
of assistance.

93
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:21,621
Well, well, well, what's
on your mind, little girl?

94
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:25,756
I realize that you are most likely
the product of lower class inbreeding.

95
00:09:25,832 --> 00:09:29,199
- But perhaps you could help me.
- Gosh, I certainly hope so.

96
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:32,466
I have been wandering
this dreary, village...

97
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:35,269
in hopes of finding
the Queen Catherine.

98
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:38,834
- You wouldn't have any idea
where she might be docked?
- You know what you are?

99
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,938
You're one of those
little fancy lads, aren't ya?

100
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:46,452
Boy, you're cute.
Gosh, what a sweet little outfit.

101
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,182
Is it your little spring outfit?

102
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:52,919
You couldn't be cuter.
You're so adorable. My.

103
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:56,019
You know, you remind me
of my niece Sally. Lovely girl.

104
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,326
She's a dietitian. Hey.

105
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:01,993
- Would you like to buy a monkey?
- I don't wanna buy a monkey.

106
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:05,095
- Are you sure?
- No, I'm on my way. Your family
must be very, proud of you.

107
00:10:05,172 --> 00:10:08,141
We'll see ya, honey.
Hey, wait a minute.
Jennifer, come here.

108
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:09,140
What?

109
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:11,803
I can show you
to that ship of yours.

110
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:13,812
- You will?
- Right down this road.

111
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,747
-Right there.
-Marvelous. I should hurry...

112
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:20,412
because they're gonna start
the banquet soon and I must
tell you, I am famished.

113
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:25,151
Well, why wouldn't ya be?
Big girls have big appetites,
don't they?

114
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:30,492
Listen, do yourself a favor.
Don't let 'em give you any
of that flank steak bullshit.

115
00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:34,728
You know what I'm sayin'?
Try, the London Broil. Yeah.

116
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,668
- That's a good tip. I shall do it.
- Sure, pamper yourself.

117
00:10:37,738 --> 00:10:39,672
- I will.
- My. Okay.

118
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:43,073
Well, I must tell you, for a yellow-eyed,
gamey-smelling lowlife,

119
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:46,078
-you really have quite
a decent heart about you.
- Well, thanks.

120
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:50,082
I'm not gonna touch you,
shake your hand or get near you
because you're all of that.

121
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,085
- But I am gonna be on my way.
- Good for you.

122
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:57,487
-Off I go.
- Hey, listen, have a good trip, Suzy.
Bye-bye.

123
00:10:57,557 --> 00:11:00,924
- Bye.
- Think about me, all right?

124
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,929
Man, man,

125
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:08,093
do I hate them fancy lads.

126
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:30,249
Uh, hey, um... I'm looking
for the steward of the Q.C.

127
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:34,919
Uh-- I'm watching the boat till
everyone gets back from lunch.

128
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:38,658
Then departure was delayed
on my behalf. Very, good.

129
00:11:38,732 --> 00:11:40,757
Uh, here's my boarding pass.

130
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:46,033
Please take me to the ship's
finest quarters 'cause I wish
to draw a hot bath. What a day.

131
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:48,666
I ain't supposed to let
nobody on the boat 'cause--

132
00:11:48,742 --> 00:11:50,676
Leo, no, no, no.

133
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:54,475
I know, I look too disheveled
to board, but I assure you,
the captain will understand.

134
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:59,850
- Wow. You know the captain?
- I should say so. He owes
his entire career to my daddy.

135
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,481
- Can we?
- Okay, since you know him and all.

136
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:07,186
Okay, fine.
Boy! Boy!

137
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:14,725
Hey--
What the--

138
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:19,397
Well, is this the tug
that's supposed to take us out
to the Queen Catherine?

139
00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:22,533
- It's a boat.
- The-- Uh--

140
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:26,170
Ho-ho-ho. I see.
This is the Queen Catherine.

141
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:30,307
It's one of those theme ships, isn't it?
Yes, I've read about these things.

142
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:34,285
Where we passengers pretend
we're common type and slum
it up a bit.

143
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:36,914
Deliciously chic.

144
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:41,120
Step, step, step.

145
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:46,063
- Step, step.
- Yes, I know they're steps.
I've seen steps before.

146
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:51,296
Marvelous!!

147
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:56,172
The best bunk we got is the captain's.
But I don't think he'd mind,
since you know him.

148
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:03,314
My, they sure do have an eye
for detail, don't they?

149
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:05,977
Awards all around.

150
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:09,078
You sure got things
figured out, don't ya?

151
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:14,058
I was never real good at figurin' stuff
out. Captain says I'm dumb as a carp.

152
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:16,994
Here's how
a harem girl dances.

153
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:29,098
Okay, well, thank you for that,
whatever that was.

154
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:33,305
And now, enough of your silly
gibberish. Go fetch me a cup
of bouillon before I retire.

155
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:37,077
- Yes? Good boy. Off you go.
- Thank you. Okay. Okay.

156
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,817
Bowl-yun.

157
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:44,652
Bowl-yawn.

158
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:49,126
Maybe it's just
a fancy word for chum.

159
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,340
Eeew. Eeew.

160
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:21,991
Pipe down, you imbecile.
My head is throbbing as it is.

161
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:25,862
Sorry,. For a second, I thought
you were my granny. She's dead.

162
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:27,957
- Right.
- Well, here's your bouillon.

163
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:31,800
Thank you very, much.
Now, will you please make sure
that I'm not disturbed till 'morrow.

164
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,634
- Okay. Bye, lady.
- Fine.

165
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:40,940
My.

166
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:47,486
A bit spicy.

167
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:50,182
Quite robust.

168
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:54,920
Your friend's here.
He's all tucked in for the night.

169
00:14:54,995 --> 00:14:56,326
Whatever you say, Einstein.

170
00:14:56,396 --> 00:15:00,264
We figured you were hungry,,
so we bought you a stick of gum.

171
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:05,293
Don't chew it all
in one place, shit-for-brains.

172
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:10,876
Gum.

173
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:16,473
All right, listen up!
We're gonna sail outta here tonight...

174
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:19,347
and keep running straight
on through till mornin'.

175
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,546
We'll drop our nets
at daybreak...

176
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:25,819
and catch them scaley bastards
while they're still groggy!

177
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:37,130
¶¶

178
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:04,594
So, Skunk, what do you think?
We got enough ocean behind us?

179
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:08,156
Yeah, yeah.
No trouble for us tonight.

180
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:12,671
- I think I'll turn in. Keep it steady,
whatever works for you.
- Okeydokey.

181
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:26,318
Uh!

182
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:14,359
- Hi. How ya doin'?
- Very well. Thank you.

183
00:17:18,843 --> 00:17:21,539
Don't this beat all, boys?

184
00:17:21,612 --> 00:17:23,546
We got us a half-crazed
boat-hopper.

185
00:17:23,614 --> 00:17:26,981
Now, see here. I don't know
what kind of nonsense you're...

186
00:17:27,051 --> 00:17:30,543
trying to pull here,
but it's painfully obvious--

187
00:17:30,621 --> 00:17:33,556
I see.

188
00:17:33,624 --> 00:17:36,616
This is all part of
the theme, right? Sure.

189
00:17:36,694 --> 00:17:40,858
And you're just stage actors
pretending to be filthy drunkards.

190
00:17:40,931 --> 00:17:43,798
Bravo. Bravo, everyone.
Long live the theater.

191
00:17:43,868 --> 00:17:49,568
- Am I missing something here?
- Holy shit in a handbasket.
This moron got on the wrong boat.

192
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,438
Now, wait a second.
Are you-- What--

193
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:55,001
Are you meaning to imply this
is not the Queen Catherine?

194
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:56,011
Uh-uh.

195
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,345
You're not its well-trained crew
here to cater to my every whim?

196
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:00,348
Nope.

197
00:18:00,417 --> 00:18:05,150
- Kid, we're just here
to catch fish and stink.
- Mostly the latter.

198
00:18:05,222 --> 00:18:07,656
Whoo! Oooh! Okay.

199
00:18:07,725 --> 00:18:10,455
Okay, um--
All right, look.

200
00:18:10,528 --> 00:18:14,988
Obviously there's been a little mix-up
here and I seem to have boarded
the wrong vessel.

201
00:18:15,065 --> 00:18:18,466
Okay. I apologize, but there's
a happy ending to all this.

202
00:18:18,536 --> 00:18:21,994
You just point this thing towards
Hawaii and drop me off there. Great.

203
00:18:22,072 --> 00:18:23,004
End of controversy.

204
00:18:23,073 --> 00:18:25,974
Now, let's go enjoy some tea
and honey-dipped willy pumps.

205
00:18:26,043 --> 00:18:28,910
Gimme the go-ahead, Cap,
and I'll kill him.

206
00:18:28,979 --> 00:18:32,574
- I knew I shouldn't have had
that last bottle of rotgut.
- Gentlemen, no, no, no.

207
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:35,676
Don't walk away from me.
Come back. No, no, no.
Don't make me run.

208
00:18:35,753 --> 00:18:38,517
Come on. You too.
Come, come, come.

209
00:18:38,589 --> 00:18:42,685
It's painfully obvious to me
that you have no idea
who you're dealing with here.

210
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:47,788
You see, I... am a fancy lad.

211
00:18:47,865 --> 00:18:51,028
Fancy lad!

212
00:18:51,101 --> 00:18:56,664
If you hinder my arrival, I'll just
have my daddy put you all on trial
and have you hanged.

213
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,607
Were you dropped on your head
as a toddler?

214
00:19:01,145 --> 00:19:04,205
Listen up, you doozy-lookin'
deuce in shoes!

215
00:19:04,281 --> 00:19:07,045
We're out here for the next
three months to catch us some fish!

216
00:19:07,117 --> 00:19:10,951
So, unless you wanna end up
as bait, stay outta my face!

217
00:19:11,021 --> 00:19:11,953
Aaah.

218
00:19:12,022 --> 00:19:15,981
Don't you walk away from me,
you big talking walrus!

219
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:18,756
This issue is not negotiable.

220
00:19:18,829 --> 00:19:20,922
I hate this.

221
00:19:20,998 --> 00:19:23,262
My christening wig!

222
00:19:23,334 --> 00:19:25,325
I've had it since infancy.

223
00:19:25,402 --> 00:19:28,963
Well, you ain't got it
no more, peckerhead.

224
00:19:33,644 --> 00:19:37,512
There, by the grace of God,
floats away my manhood.

225
00:19:45,256 --> 00:19:49,818
Simply put, a five-pound box of
chocolate-covered macadamia nuts
is yours...

226
00:19:49,894 --> 00:19:53,295
if you'll point this swill heap
towards Hawaii, comprende?

227
00:19:53,364 --> 00:19:54,831
Sorry,, I'll have to pass.

228
00:19:54,899 --> 00:20:00,303
These stockings I'm wearing
are made of pure imported silk
from the mountains of Bennenia.

229
00:20:00,371 --> 00:20:03,807
- They're yours if you get me to Hawaii.
- Yeah?

230
00:20:03,874 --> 00:20:07,867
These socks I'm wearin' are pure wool
and they've been on my feet
for three straight weeks.

231
00:20:07,945 --> 00:20:10,641
And if you don't blow,
you're gonna swallow them
like an aspirin.

232
00:20:10,714 --> 00:20:15,981
If my poor daddy doesn't hear
from me soon, there's no telling
what he might do.

233
00:20:16,053 --> 00:20:19,750
I'm afraid
he'll become despondent
and turn a pistol upon himself.

234
00:20:19,823 --> 00:20:23,259
Hey, you wanna learn
a little fisherman's Greek?

235
00:20:25,396 --> 00:20:30,163
""Gadinga pachinga castinga.''
That means ""I kissed a girl.''

236
00:20:32,736 --> 00:20:35,432
""Patuka cachuka stabuka.''

237
00:20:35,506 --> 00:20:38,566
That means,
""I felt up a girl's ass.''

238
00:20:38,642 --> 00:20:41,133
All right. Fine.

239
00:20:41,211 --> 00:20:45,341
""Katinka kawinka kalinka.''
You know what that means.

240
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:47,577
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

241
00:20:47,651 --> 00:20:52,179
Is there not one person on this boat
who's not monstrously insane?

242
00:20:52,256 --> 00:20:55,919
Oooh, it's maddening.
I'm at my wit's end. I can't take it--

243
00:21:18,983 --> 00:21:21,884
Hello?

244
00:21:21,952 --> 00:21:25,285
I can't say as I blame you,
standing by yourself.

245
00:21:25,356 --> 00:21:29,122
There's no such thing as
pleasant companionship
on this tawdry vessel.

246
00:21:29,193 --> 00:21:32,788
Sorry,, but I ain't supposed to
talk to nobody while I'm on watch.

247
00:21:32,863 --> 00:21:36,629
Captain Greybar says I got
the attention span of a circus monkey.

248
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:41,728
I don't think your Capt. Greybar
is qualified to cast aspersions
on the character of others.

249
00:21:43,974 --> 00:21:46,465
Sorry,,
I don't speak Spanish.

250
00:21:48,012 --> 00:21:50,480
Pardon me, I seem
to have forgotten your name.

251
00:21:50,547 --> 00:21:52,378
Kenny.

252
00:21:52,449 --> 00:21:54,781
Kenneth, uh...

253
00:21:54,852 --> 00:22:00,256
your captain has been under
a great deal of stress recently
and he's in need of a holiday.

254
00:22:00,324 --> 00:22:02,952
You mean like Halloween?

255
00:22:03,961 --> 00:22:06,486
Yes.
Like Halloween.

256
00:22:06,563 --> 00:22:11,330
Wouldn't you like to help
your weary, captain rest
his rum-soaked bones?

257
00:22:11,402 --> 00:22:15,839
Uh...yeah, I guess...
if you think he'd like that.

258
00:22:15,906 --> 00:22:19,467
- What do I gotta do?
- It's magnificently simple.

259
00:22:19,543 --> 00:22:22,205
Tonight, after they've
all fallen asleep,

260
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:25,715
change the course of the boat
and head it for Hawaii.

261
00:22:25,783 --> 00:22:28,843
- You think you're capable of that?
- Sure.

262
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:33,219
I ain't too swift about other stuff,
but I know maps real good.

263
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:36,020
So, he'll be happy
about this?

264
00:22:36,093 --> 00:22:38,789
No, absolutely. In fact,
I overheard him telling somebody,

265
00:22:38,862 --> 00:22:43,356
""My wouldn't it be jolly-jack splendid
to spend a fortnight or two in Hawaii?''

266
00:22:43,434 --> 00:22:46,995
Yup, that sounds like him.
You do good impressions.

267
00:22:47,071 --> 00:22:51,030
Right. Okay, then fine.
After they've all fallen into
their alcohol-induced slumbers,

268
00:22:51,108 --> 00:22:53,338
we'll put our little plan
into action.

269
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:56,846
Remember, this is
our little secret, yeah?

270
00:22:56,914 --> 00:22:59,382
Okay.

271
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:02,647
All right. You're--
You're a big happy one, aren't you?

272
00:23:14,598 --> 00:23:16,532
Swine.

273
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,034
Filthy swine.
Echh!

274
00:23:20,237 --> 00:23:24,003
Okay.
The pigs are all asleep.

275
00:23:24,074 --> 00:23:27,737
Okay. Looks like all
we gotta do is shift her...

276
00:23:27,811 --> 00:23:31,747
250,000 degrees...
northeast...

277
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:35,680
and we'll be headed
straight for Hawaii.

278
00:23:35,752 --> 00:23:39,313
- Okay, fine. Do it quickly now.
- Okay. Let's see here.

279
00:23:50,467 --> 00:23:52,401
Okay, we're goin' to Hawaii.

280
00:23:52,469 --> 00:23:55,461
Okay, great.
Well, good job, old boy.

281
00:23:55,539 --> 00:24:00,841
And you know what?
When we reach the islands, I may
buy you a big red, shiny apple.

282
00:24:00,911 --> 00:24:03,937
Geez, thanks.

283
00:24:04,014 --> 00:24:06,539
A human tree stump.

284
00:24:06,617 --> 00:24:11,782
After a brief derailment, my life
is back on its proper course.

285
00:24:11,855 --> 00:24:15,985
Fret not, Daddy. I shall
be with you in a saint's whisper.

286
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,327
Stupid.

287
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:09,801
What in the Savior's name--

288
00:25:12,939 --> 00:25:18,104
What do you think you're doing?
This is no time for stunt sailing.
Stop this immediately.

289
00:25:18,178 --> 00:25:21,545
- I'm trying.
- You're not trying hard enough. Aaah!

290
00:25:21,614 --> 00:25:23,605
Get off me!

291
00:25:28,054 --> 00:25:30,887
What the--
You doofus!

292
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:37,553
Everybody, get your asses outside!
Move, move, move!

293
00:25:42,202 --> 00:25:45,729
- Maybe I should drop anchor.
- Do you think that'll help?

294
00:25:45,805 --> 00:25:49,434
- I don't know.
I'm not very, bright, remember?
-Just do it!

295
00:25:49,509 --> 00:25:53,275
Try, anything, will ya!
What am I supposed to--

296
00:25:53,346 --> 00:25:57,407
Don't worry,.
It seems a lot worse than it is.

297
00:25:57,483 --> 00:25:59,417
- What?
- Ooo-aaah!

298
00:26:03,089 --> 00:26:05,250
Whoo! Whoo!

299
00:26:05,325 --> 00:26:08,783
Paddle your rump back here
and steer this boat!

300
00:26:08,862 --> 00:26:12,798
Tell Capt. Greybar
I hope he enjoys Hawaii.

301
00:26:12,866 --> 00:26:16,165
And remind him that
we're almost out of margarine.

302
00:26:16,236 --> 00:26:19,865
Come back! Oooh, you can't do
this to me! Come-- Come back!

303
00:26:21,574 --> 00:26:24,372
- Secure that boom!
- Aye-aye, Captain.

304
00:26:24,444 --> 00:26:26,935
Ooo-hooo!
Stop this! Aaah!

305
00:26:27,013 --> 00:26:29,880
- Oooh!
- Grab the wheel!

306
00:26:29,949 --> 00:26:32,543
Okay, Skip!

307
00:26:33,887 --> 00:26:36,219
Whoo-whoo-hoo!

308
00:26:36,289 --> 00:26:39,258
Shit!

309
00:26:42,495 --> 00:26:45,487
I don't like this!

310
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,829
Looks like Kenny
got us off course.

311
00:26:50,904 --> 00:26:55,466
That don't sound like Kenny.
He's dumb but he don't take
a leak before tellin' me.

312
00:26:55,541 --> 00:26:59,602
Well, it's his scribbles.
If this thing's right,
look where it's landin' us.

313
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:03,046
Sweet Jake, Hell's Bucket!

314
00:27:04,884 --> 00:27:09,287
Kenny! Get your fat,
worthless ass over here!

315
00:27:09,355 --> 00:27:13,382
- I ain't seen
that little sow anywhere.
- Hey. What the hell is this!

316
00:27:13,459 --> 00:27:16,519
Aaaw!

317
00:27:16,596 --> 00:27:19,759
Get over here, perfume boy!

318
00:27:21,935 --> 00:27:24,369
Look at this.

319
00:27:24,437 --> 00:27:27,531
Well, I merely suggested
to Kenneth that...

320
00:27:27,607 --> 00:27:31,509
perhaps it would be fun if we set
the ship's course for Hawaii.

321
00:27:31,577 --> 00:27:34,569
- Jesus Christ!
- Why, why, why,

322
00:27:34,647 --> 00:27:38,606
had I known he'd be blown overboard
by a gust of wind, I never
would have suggested it.

323
00:27:38,685 --> 00:27:42,280
Get outta my sight
before you join him!

324
00:27:42,355 --> 00:27:43,913
- What, I--
- Aaah!

325
00:28:01,374 --> 00:28:06,175
If I'd have just listened
to Mommy, I'd have gone into
the goddamned butcher business,

326
00:28:06,245 --> 00:28:09,442
and I wouldn't be in this predicament
in the first place.

327
00:28:09,515 --> 00:28:12,507
""No, Daddy,
I wants to be a sailor.''

328
00:28:12,585 --> 00:28:17,352
Goddammit. Fuck it.
I'll never get out of here.

329
00:28:17,423 --> 00:28:19,755
And the net's torn to pieces.

330
00:28:19,826 --> 00:28:23,318
Goddammit, what am I supposed
to do now? Catch 'em with my hands?

331
00:28:23,396 --> 00:28:26,559
We're in deep shit, Greybar.
What the hell are we gonna do?

332
00:28:26,632 --> 00:28:28,259
What do you think?
Give me a clue, will ya?

333
00:28:28,334 --> 00:28:31,235
The engine's flooded,
the mizzenmast is down...

334
00:28:31,304 --> 00:28:35,172
- and we got a crack in
the mid-section that's drawing water.
- Wonderful!

335
00:28:35,241 --> 00:28:37,573
Aaah! We got
any options here?

336
00:28:37,643 --> 00:28:41,306
The only thing to do as far as
I can tell is find a safe harbor
and fix the boat.

337
00:28:41,381 --> 00:28:46,785
As you know, there's only one island
in Hell's Bucket and I am not crazy
about landing there.

338
00:28:46,853 --> 00:28:50,949
Yeah, well, I ain't crazy about
sittin' on a boat till she sinks
and we wind up flounder shit.

339
00:28:51,024 --> 00:28:54,585
Yeah, those flounders
are bloodthirsty bastards.

340
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:57,151
Looks like we ain't
got a choice.

341
00:28:57,230 --> 00:29:00,893
If we don't make it to that island,
we're all gonna end up on the bottom.

342
00:29:00,967 --> 00:29:04,095
We stay in Hell's Bucket long enough,
that's the least of our worries.

343
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:07,867
There's bad mojo
all around here.

344
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:11,933
Instead of
standing around philosophizin'
like a bunch of old washer women,

345
00:29:12,011 --> 00:29:17,005
let's get to the goddamned island,
fix the boat and blow outta this hole!

346
00:29:17,083 --> 00:29:20,678
And I say we dump that jinx kid.
He's a born Jonah.

347
00:29:20,753 --> 00:29:23,779
As soon as we get to the island,
he's history,.

348
00:29:23,856 --> 00:29:27,792
We'll send him out to pick berries
or somethin' and then haul ass.

349
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:31,318
Yeah, pick berries.

350
00:29:38,037 --> 00:29:42,667
- Please don't harm me.
I'm meek as a kitten. Truly I am.
- Stop. Cease.

351
00:29:42,742 --> 00:29:45,609
Listen here, boy.
You got us groin-deep in trouble...

352
00:29:45,678 --> 00:29:49,409
and I am this close to turning
your powdered ass into chum.

353
00:29:49,482 --> 00:29:52,645
I must take offense to that.
I haven't powdered my bottom
since I was 17--

354
00:29:52,718 --> 00:29:55,846
Cork it! From here on out,
since we're one hand short,

355
00:29:55,922 --> 00:30:01,087
you're gonna do every, dirty, shitty,
snot-soaked job that needs doin'
around here!

356
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,560
- Got it?
- Is there any good news?

357
00:30:03,629 --> 00:30:07,258
The good news...
is that I may let you live.

358
00:30:07,333 --> 00:30:09,563
And if you behave yourself,

359
00:30:09,635 --> 00:30:12,502
we'll drop you off in Hawaii,

360
00:30:12,572 --> 00:30:15,837
-Japan, wherever the hell you're goin'.
- Thank you, Captain.

361
00:30:15,908 --> 00:30:19,173
- That's what I wanted to hear.
- Okay! First things first.

362
00:30:19,245 --> 00:30:23,875
Get outta these sissy clothes and
go put on some of Kenny's duds.
God rest his sweet soul.

363
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:29,081
And I want you to think of
his fat, pimpled ass every time
you slip into his boots!

364
00:30:29,155 --> 00:30:33,023
I just pray that those boots
have adequate arch support
because I have problem feet--

365
00:30:33,092 --> 00:30:35,151
Git!

366
00:30:36,238 --> 00:30:38,399
Yuck.

367
00:30:40,276 --> 00:30:43,074
Okay. Here we go.

368
00:30:43,145 --> 00:30:45,340
Be calm.
Do it. Do it to it.

369
00:30:45,414 --> 00:30:50,374
Oooh! That's it. The head
came off and what's inside
stinks and that's all I'm doing.

370
00:30:50,453 --> 00:30:52,387
- I'm done.
- Hi.

371
00:30:52,455 --> 00:30:54,685
Come on, you're doing very well.

372
00:30:54,757 --> 00:30:57,385
- Aaah, I hate you.
- Sorry,.

373
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,758
Aaah!

374
00:31:05,468 --> 00:31:07,868
He did it.

375
00:31:07,937 --> 00:31:11,771
There. Now here's something
your fancy ass can't screw up.

376
00:31:11,841 --> 00:31:16,574
And don't quit until every, square inch
of this deck is clean...

377
00:31:16,646 --> 00:31:19,080
as a church piss house.

378
00:31:21,851 --> 00:31:25,514
Oddly enough, it kind of tastes
like marzipan. Go figure.

379
00:31:25,588 --> 00:31:27,522
Aaaw. Aaaw.

380
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:31,048
I'm sorry,. Could you explain
this chore to me one more time?

381
00:31:31,127 --> 00:31:34,062
It's a little something
we call ""outward watch.''

382
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:37,861
Here's how it works:
We'll let out some rope
so you can drift along behind us.

383
00:31:37,933 --> 00:31:42,961
All you gotta do is keep
your eyes open for other boats,
cars, flying saucers, shit like that.

384
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:46,941
And exactly, how much rope
are you gonna let out,
about ten feet or so?

385
00:31:47,009 --> 00:31:49,409
Two miles worth.

386
00:31:49,478 --> 00:31:53,574
That sounds a trifle peculiar
but I suppose you're the experts.

387
00:31:53,649 --> 00:31:57,745
Hey, one more thing? Is it true
it's unsafe to drink seawater?

388
00:32:00,289 --> 00:32:02,985
That's a new one to me.
It's water, ain't it?

389
00:32:03,059 --> 00:32:06,358
We gave you a carton of chocolate milk.
What else you want?

390
00:32:06,429 --> 00:32:09,921
All right, Geronimo.
Let's get your ass out there.

391
00:32:09,999 --> 00:32:15,096
And in about a week,
when your shift is over, give
this rope a tug and we'll haul you in.

392
00:32:15,171 --> 00:32:18,766
Okay.
Well, I'm off.

393
00:32:18,841 --> 00:32:21,207
Not crazy about the idea.

394
00:32:21,277 --> 00:32:25,737
- Send us a postcard, Daisy.
- Bon voyages.

395
00:32:25,815 --> 00:32:29,649
Great idea, Skipper.
Finally, some peace and quiet.

396
00:32:37,293 --> 00:32:39,887
Boom-boom.
Water, boom-boom.

397
00:32:39,962 --> 00:32:42,294
Hot sun, water.

398
00:32:42,364 --> 00:32:44,798
Boring.
What's another word for it?

399
00:32:44,867 --> 00:32:47,893
Dullsville.
It's Dullsville.

400
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:51,804
I hate it. I hate it.
I hate it.

401
00:32:51,874 --> 00:32:54,206
I hate it. I hate it.

402
00:32:57,613 --> 00:33:00,514
It's hot.

403
00:33:00,583 --> 00:33:03,575
I'm burning up. There's gotta be
some lotion in here.

404
00:33:03,652 --> 00:33:07,952
What's this? Cooking oil.
Maybe that's nature's moisturizer.

405
00:33:12,328 --> 00:33:14,990
That should do it.

406
00:33:15,064 --> 00:33:19,330
About a number 15
it feels like. Ooo-kay.

407
00:33:25,074 --> 00:33:28,840
What are you doing here?
He didn't know--
Boo! Boo! Bow!

408
00:33:31,313 --> 00:33:33,645
Boo.

409
00:33:33,716 --> 00:33:37,618
It's lunchtime.
Yeah, it's lunchtime.

410
00:33:37,686 --> 00:33:39,677
Let's get something to eat.
Come on.

411
00:33:39,755 --> 00:33:43,657
Yeah, let's have our good friend.
We'll have our--

412
00:33:43,726 --> 00:33:46,627
It's a pretty color.

413
00:33:48,898 --> 00:33:52,265
But it don't
taste pretty. Uh-uh. Oooh.

414
00:33:52,334 --> 00:33:56,202
I need something to drink fast.
Come on! Come on. Come on.

415
00:33:56,272 --> 00:33:58,900
Aaa-aaah. Aaah.

416
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:04,170
Thirsty.

417
00:34:17,259 --> 00:34:20,524
Good afternoon, madam.
Would you like to buy a donkey?

418
00:34:20,596 --> 00:34:24,191
Donkeys are on sale today
through Thursday and be sure
to visit our linen department...

419
00:34:24,266 --> 00:34:28,362
for spectacular savings on
stereophonic pumpkins and
glow-in-the-dark bowling balls.

420
00:34:28,437 --> 00:34:32,100
- Hey, man, pull yourself together.
 - Kenny!

421
00:34:32,174 --> 00:34:34,870
What are you doing here?

422
00:34:34,944 --> 00:34:36,571
I just wanted to stop by and say,

423
00:34:36,645 --> 00:34:38,909
""Hang in there.
You're doin' a hell of a job.''

424
00:34:38,981 --> 00:34:43,008
- Very, kind of you, Kenny.
- Well, keep up the good work.

425
00:34:43,085 --> 00:34:45,918
Bonsoir.

426
00:34:50,359 --> 00:34:54,159
He's going down into the water.

427
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:56,926
Okay. Well, you know, most people
would think they were insane...

428
00:34:56,999 --> 00:35:01,129
if they saw something like that,
but luckily I have an open mind
about this sort of thing--

429
00:35:01,203 --> 00:35:04,263
Now, I know what you're thinkin'.

430
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:08,777
What could be stranger than
a big, fat-ass, floating cupcake?

431
00:35:08,844 --> 00:35:11,472
Hey, how 'bout one
that spits tobacco?

432
00:35:13,849 --> 00:35:16,943
See ya around, buddy.

433
00:35:17,019 --> 00:35:20,250
That's a cute kid.

434
00:35:20,322 --> 00:35:24,383
Okay, it's official. Nathanial
Mayweather has lost his mind.

435
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:28,829
I've got cabin fever or raft fever.
I've got some kind of fever.

436
00:35:28,898 --> 00:35:32,857
Look, look, I can fly.
I'm a parakeet!

437
00:35:32,935 --> 00:35:35,904
Somebody give me
a sunflower seed.

438
00:36:45,307 --> 00:36:47,138
Has it been a week already?

439
00:36:47,209 --> 00:36:49,973
Actually it's been nine days.
Time flies.

440
00:36:50,045 --> 00:36:52,741
We'll probably have to
shovel him off that raft.

441
00:36:52,815 --> 00:36:56,376
Yeah. Maybe if we're lucky,
he'll die in a few hours.

442
00:36:56,452 --> 00:37:00,047
This kid ain't real.

443
00:37:00,122 --> 00:37:03,057
I'm back, fellas.

444
00:37:03,125 --> 00:37:06,617
Whooo!
Hooo-oooh. Hi.

445
00:37:06,695 --> 00:37:09,255
Thank you.

446
00:37:09,331 --> 00:37:12,823
Greeting, fellow fishermen.
Oooh-hoow.

447
00:37:12,901 --> 00:37:15,699
I never thought I'd be
so happy to see you again--

448
00:37:15,771 --> 00:37:17,500
and this stinking garbage scow.

449
00:37:17,573 --> 00:37:20,701
Big Teddy, thank you.
A welcome home sandwich.

450
00:37:20,776 --> 00:37:24,109
You sure got
a lot of energy for someone
who's half-dead from exposure.

451
00:37:24,179 --> 00:37:29,207
That's a very, good point.
I would have been dead had it
not been for the sharkman.

452
00:37:29,284 --> 00:37:31,479
Sharkman?

453
00:37:31,553 --> 00:37:35,956
judging from his appearance,
that's the most appropriate name
I could come up with for him.

454
00:37:36,025 --> 00:37:38,459
I hate this kid.

455
00:37:38,527 --> 00:37:40,893
This, uh, thing
you're talkin' about.

456
00:37:40,963 --> 00:37:45,798
- Did it have the body of a shark
and the arms and face of a man?
- That's the chap.

457
00:37:45,868 --> 00:37:49,634
- Holy jumpin' jack fish. Chocki!
- Chocki!

458
00:37:49,705 --> 00:37:53,402
- Who the hell is Chocki?
- Half-man, half-shark.

459
00:37:53,475 --> 00:37:58,469
Legend has it, a Viking ship went down
in Hell's Bucket 500 years ago.

460
00:37:58,547 --> 00:38:02,779
One of the Vikings was spared
a grisly death by a shark
who fell in love with him.

461
00:38:02,851 --> 00:38:06,150
Well, you know how it goes.
One thing led to another and--

462
00:38:06,221 --> 00:38:08,451
The Viking knocked up
the shark?

463
00:38:08,524 --> 00:38:12,255
And they had one offspring::
Chocki.

464
00:38:12,327 --> 00:38:16,423
just when you think you've heard
everything about Hell's Bucket,

465
00:38:16,498 --> 00:38:20,457
along comes another
nauseating legend.

466
00:38:22,771 --> 00:38:26,298
And the bad thing is Chocki's
kind of flighty by nature.

467
00:38:26,375 --> 00:38:29,310
He can be friendly one minute,
and then hate you the next.

468
00:38:29,378 --> 00:38:33,940
Now that he's taken
a shine to the kid here,
he's probably following us,

469
00:38:34,016 --> 00:38:38,043
- and that could be trouble.
- Well, why's he so flighty?

470
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:41,385
Who the hell knows. We're talkin'
about a half-man, half-shark.

471
00:38:41,457 --> 00:38:45,621
There's gotta be some kind
of a chromosomal damage
with a matchup like that.

472
00:38:45,694 --> 00:38:48,754
Hey! Take a look at this.

473
00:38:48,831 --> 00:38:52,665
Lord, spare me another one
of these insanities.

474
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:59,569
Sweet Henry,. She's got more whiskers
than a laid-off circus clown.

475
00:38:59,641 --> 00:39:02,906
Gee, they ought to rename
this place ""Wackyville.''

476
00:39:02,978 --> 00:39:07,142
Ooh, 'cause it's wacky.

477
00:39:16,025 --> 00:39:20,587
Aaah. Oooh, I'll feel better
once we get outta these waters.

478
00:39:20,663 --> 00:39:25,123
All this anxiety from being
in a strange and mysterious land...

479
00:39:25,201 --> 00:39:27,965
- is giving me gas.
- Aw, Christ.

480
00:39:28,037 --> 00:39:30,767
Geez.

481
00:39:32,408 --> 00:39:35,707
Purple lightning.
That's always a good sign.

482
00:39:40,182 --> 00:39:43,982
Here they are.
Your fish stick kitties.

483
00:39:44,053 --> 00:39:46,988
My own invention.
Thank you very, much.

484
00:39:47,056 --> 00:39:50,924
I thought mealtime could use
a little sprucing up around here.

485
00:39:50,993 --> 00:39:53,484
Paps, here's your kitty.

486
00:39:53,562 --> 00:39:56,759
I'm awful tasty, Paps--

487
00:39:56,832 --> 00:39:59,995
Get out of my face,
you half-assed Edgar Bergen.

488
00:40:00,069 --> 00:40:02,003
Here.
Have some coffee.

489
00:40:06,409 --> 00:40:09,867
Paps, you're such a little card.

490
00:40:09,945 --> 00:40:13,073
Now, where's that naughty Captain?
He knows it's suppertime.

491
00:40:13,149 --> 00:40:16,516
¶

492
00:40:21,524 --> 00:40:25,688
¶ When I go ashore
and get my pay ¶

493
00:40:25,761 --> 00:40:29,595
¶ I'll go and meet
my Essie May ¶

494
00:40:29,665 --> 00:40:33,066
¶ She'll hike her skirt
and toss her shoe ¶

495
00:40:33,135 --> 00:40:37,071
¶ She'll clean my pipes,
my buddies' too ¶

496
00:40:37,139 --> 00:40:41,371
¶ Don't need a church
to find my way ¶

497
00:40:42,678 --> 00:40:46,637
¶'Cause I found heaven
with Essie May ¶¶

498
00:40:52,288 --> 00:40:54,222
¶

499
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:58,989
That was the most beautiful thing
I've ever heard.

500
00:40:59,061 --> 00:41:01,928
It was like honey
from the lips of an angel.

501
00:41:04,266 --> 00:41:07,360
Bless you.

502
00:41:07,436 --> 00:41:11,270
Cappy, tell me
about all of this.

503
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:14,241
Tell me about the sea.
What does it mean to you?

504
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:18,576
Basically, money. I come from
six generations of seamen.

505
00:41:18,647 --> 00:41:24,244
All with the same goal in life: Catch
fish, sell 'em, get drunk and get laid.

506
00:41:25,688 --> 00:41:29,055
- I don't thinkAristotle
could've said it better.
- Uh-

507
00:41:29,125 --> 00:41:32,617
Yeah. You might say I dropped
outta my mama's womb...

508
00:41:32,695 --> 00:41:35,755
with galoshes on my feet
and a fishing rod in my hand.

509
00:41:35,831 --> 00:41:39,323
Ouch. That poor woman.

510
00:41:41,704 --> 00:41:42,636
I don't know, Cappy.

511
00:41:42,705 --> 00:41:45,367
I'm beginning to wonder
if it's really people like you...

512
00:41:45,441 --> 00:41:50,105
who wander the world
like shaggy, unkempt beasts,

513
00:41:50,179 --> 00:41:52,613
who really know
what's important in life.

514
00:41:52,681 --> 00:41:56,947
- Okay, boy. I'm officially sick
of you now. Take off.
- Are you quite sure?

515
00:41:57,019 --> 00:42:00,079
Sometimes if we've had
a little too much to drink
we tend to say the opposite--

516
00:42:00,156 --> 00:42:04,456
- Blow!
- Okay. That'll do it for me.
I'll just move it on out.

517
00:42:20,109 --> 00:42:24,910
¶¶

518
00:42:34,223 --> 00:42:38,023
¶¶

519
00:42:38,093 --> 00:42:43,030
My Lord,
she's the most beautiful thing
I've ever laid eyes on.

520
00:42:43,098 --> 00:42:48,900
Every, instinct in my lower half
tells me the Holy Father
has preordained our meeting.

521
00:42:48,971 --> 00:42:51,371
Hello, miss!

522
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,603
Miss, excuse me? Geez.

523
00:42:54,677 --> 00:42:59,376
just my luck. I fall in love
for the first time in my life
and it's with a corpse.

524
00:43:01,016 --> 00:43:03,041
What the--

525
00:43:03,118 --> 00:43:06,747
What the hell are you doing?

526
00:43:06,822 --> 00:43:11,259
Thank heavens. There's still some life
left in her after all. Thank you, Lord.
I owe you one.

527
00:43:11,327 --> 00:43:14,819
Uh... here.
Willkommen.

528
00:43:17,299 --> 00:43:19,597
Aaah, geez.

529
00:43:19,668 --> 00:43:22,330
You idiot! Do you know
what you just did?

530
00:43:22,404 --> 00:43:26,272
- You just ruined my chance at setting a world's record.
-  - Say what?

531
00:43:26,342 --> 00:43:30,244
I was swimming around the world,
Maryland to Maryland.

532
00:43:30,312 --> 00:43:34,408
And I was halfway there
until you blew the whole thing!

533
00:43:34,483 --> 00:43:38,476
No, you were just lying there
like a rat in a swimming pool--

534
00:43:38,554 --> 00:43:43,218
I was sleeping!
And by you yanking me onto
this floating Dumpster,

535
00:43:43,292 --> 00:43:47,456
I violated one of the rules set forth
by the World's Record committee.

536
00:43:47,529 --> 00:43:52,364
""At no time shall a swimmer's body
come in contact with anything solid.''

537
00:43:52,434 --> 00:43:57,565
Yeah, okay. But technically,
I'm not solid. My texture's
much more like moist bread.

538
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:01,576
Shit. I knew it was bad luck
to swim through Hell's Bucket.

539
00:44:01,644 --> 00:44:04,670
Look, you have a hard
piece of seaweed stuck to you.
Let me just pull it.

540
00:44:04,747 --> 00:44:08,444
- Relax. My wig!
- Take your hands off me.

541
00:44:09,485 --> 00:44:12,215
Faith has truly
brought us together.

542
00:44:12,288 --> 00:44:15,917
-Just... stay the hell away from me.
- Oooh.

543
00:44:15,991 --> 00:44:18,551
Attentionne, messieurs.

544
00:44:18,627 --> 00:44:22,563
Please join me on the upper deck.
I have a little surprise for you.

545
00:44:22,631 --> 00:44:26,499
Come on, fellas. Looky what
I fished out of the ocean.

546
00:44:26,568 --> 00:44:32,097
That's one little cute fishy
this cabin boy done caught hisself.

547
00:44:32,174 --> 00:44:34,540
Aw, not bad. I'd do it.

548
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:37,579
Where in the hell
did you come from, missy?

549
00:44:37,646 --> 00:44:40,774
The last thing we need
is another straggler.

550
00:44:40,849 --> 00:44:44,512
First of all, I was minding
my own business until your son
yanked me up here.

551
00:44:44,586 --> 00:44:49,182
And secondly, don't you call me
missy again unless you wanna
lose the rest of your teeth.

552
00:44:49,258 --> 00:44:52,955
Sassy little thing, ain't she?
Want me to give her a spanking?

553
00:44:53,028 --> 00:44:56,020
I'd like her to give me a spanking.

554
00:44:56,098 --> 00:44:59,659
- How'd you like me
to put my foot up your ass?

555
00:44:59,735 --> 00:45:01,828
Come on, now.
Gentlemen, please.

556
00:45:01,904 --> 00:45:06,932
I know that salty sea talk
is a big part of being a fisherman,
but Trina is our guest.

557
00:45:07,009 --> 00:45:11,036
And until we take her to Maryland,
could we please curb the language?

558
00:45:11,113 --> 00:45:15,846
So we're gonna drop her off
in Maryland? What the hell
is this, a crosstown bus?

559
00:45:15,918 --> 00:45:20,787
je-sus! I never saw a man
p-whipped so fast in my life!

560
00:45:20,856 --> 00:45:24,189
P-whipped. Now, I'm confused.
Isn't that French for pudding?

561
00:45:24,259 --> 00:45:29,026
Hopeless. Absolutely,
utterly goddamned hopeless.
I don't know why we keep trying.

562
00:45:29,098 --> 00:45:32,067
Damn.

563
00:45:32,134 --> 00:45:35,535
Now, he'll have some company
on that island.

564
00:45:35,604 --> 00:45:37,697
Yeah.

565
00:45:41,844 --> 00:45:45,610
Paps, I think you can go ahead and run
downstairs and play now if you like.

566
00:45:47,449 --> 00:45:51,852
So, things are settling down...
which is good.

567
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,582
A quiet time.
Sssh.

568
00:45:56,555 --> 00:46:01,356
¶¶

569
00:46:01,426 --> 00:46:04,691
Do-si-do.

570
00:46:04,763 --> 00:46:07,288
Now, heel and toe.

571
00:46:10,168 --> 00:46:12,363
Aaah.

572
00:46:15,274 --> 00:46:18,505
Yowza!

573
00:46:25,584 --> 00:46:28,485
What a bunch of lunkheads.

574
00:46:28,553 --> 00:46:31,613
Trina!.

575
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:34,853
Trina, I'm so glad you decided
to join us. I was just putting on...

576
00:46:34,926 --> 00:46:39,329
- a show for the fellas.
- So this is what
you guys do for fun?

577
00:46:39,398 --> 00:46:42,196
- Yeah.
- Humiliate an imbecile?

578
00:46:42,267 --> 00:46:46,067
Sure he's clumsy and he's stupid
and he's a screwup,

579
00:46:46,138 --> 00:46:49,335
but you don't have to
treat him like an animal.

580
00:46:49,408 --> 00:46:51,569
Funny you should
mention screwups,

581
00:46:51,643 --> 00:46:55,704
because an hour ago,
I made the mistake of using
your swimming diary to light the stove.

582
00:46:55,781 --> 00:47:01,549
I've been keeping that diary,
for 15 years, you ape!

583
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:04,885
- Dance, boy, dance!
- ¶¶

584
00:47:04,956 --> 00:47:08,915
All right. Hold him tonight.
just one bear cub to you.

585
00:47:14,099 --> 00:47:16,499
What the hell's that?

586
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:23,399
I'm afraid to say it.

587
00:47:23,475 --> 00:47:28,913
Chocki. He must of sensed
we were kind of debasing the kid
a little bit. Now, he's pissed.

588
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:35,447
If he opens up that hole
any wider, we're all gonna be
bunkin' on the bottom tonight.

589
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,455
We gotta throw that kid overboard.

590
00:47:38,523 --> 00:47:42,015
Wait a second.
Maybe there's a way out of this.

591
00:47:46,198 --> 00:47:48,758
Let her rip.

592
00:47:53,138 --> 00:47:56,539
There goes your little buddy
Nathanial, Chocki!

593
00:47:56,608 --> 00:47:59,941
Go play with him.
Play nice.

594
00:48:06,952 --> 00:48:11,218
He fell for it!
Skunk, Skunk, you're a genius!

595
00:48:11,289 --> 00:48:15,783
For the ten millionth time,
don't kiss me!

596
00:48:15,861 --> 00:48:20,059
Why must we always
hide our emotions,
Mr. Macho Man?

597
00:48:26,071 --> 00:48:30,599
- Gimme three.
- Three? Very, interesting.

598
00:48:30,675 --> 00:48:32,836
- Paps?
- Six.

599
00:48:32,911 --> 00:48:35,471
Six?

600
00:48:35,547 --> 00:48:39,608
It's relaxing up here.

601
00:48:39,684 --> 00:48:42,346
Staring off into the night sky.

602
00:48:42,421 --> 00:48:46,255
Those sparkly, twinkly things.
I forget their technical name.

603
00:48:46,324 --> 00:48:48,622
- Stars.
- Whatever.

604
00:48:48,693 --> 00:48:51,890
Thinking about the future.
What it might bring.

605
00:48:51,963 --> 00:48:56,059
Actually, I was thinking
I'd kill for a cheesesteak
and a bottle of scotch.

606
00:48:56,134 --> 00:49:00,093
Trina. I don't know
why or how this is happening to me,

607
00:49:00,172 --> 00:49:03,835
but I am developing
deep, deep feelings for you...

608
00:49:03,909 --> 00:49:07,936
- despite the fact that you have
the breeding of a carnival barker.
- Lovely.

609
00:49:08,013 --> 00:49:12,211
I must also tell you
that these feelings are not
just of the zipper variety.

610
00:49:12,284 --> 00:49:14,809
That's a relief.

611
00:49:16,154 --> 00:49:18,122
Listen, Nathanial,

612
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:21,819
I've been working in steel mills
since I was nine years old,

613
00:49:21,893 --> 00:49:25,385
ever since I ran away
from the honor farm.

614
00:49:25,464 --> 00:49:29,127
I'm a drifter
and a loner at heart.

615
00:49:29,201 --> 00:49:32,659
Between forging girders
and swimming,

616
00:49:32,737 --> 00:49:35,865
I don't have a lot
of time for relationships.

617
00:49:35,941 --> 00:49:39,433
Understand?

618
00:49:39,511 --> 00:49:43,971
I'm sorry,. I was just thinking how
much fun it is to roast pumpkin seeds.

619
00:49:44,049 --> 00:49:47,075
Did I mention I have
an incredible crush on you?

620
00:49:47,152 --> 00:49:51,179
That's wonderful. I'm flattered when
a psychotic becomes smitten with me.

621
00:49:51,256 --> 00:49:55,886
No problem. But, not another
peep, zip, boop. You need your rest.

622
00:49:55,961 --> 00:49:59,920
We'll continue this tomorrow.
Besides, you're wearing me out
with your incessant babbling.

623
00:49:59,998 --> 00:50:04,230
It's in my ear all night.
Yadda-babba-babba-babba.

624
00:50:04,302 --> 00:50:07,203
Well, it was nice almost
communicating with you.

625
00:50:07,272 --> 00:50:11,368
Kiddo, you are ""A'' number one
in my book, you know that?
You are top dollar.

626
00:50:11,443 --> 00:50:15,777
You know, I honestly think
we're onto something here.
Hey, nice shoes. Those--

627
00:50:26,491 --> 00:50:29,324
- Bet one.
- See ya.

628
00:50:29,394 --> 00:50:31,658
- I'm in.
- Paps?

629
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:34,164
- Six.
- Six.

630
00:50:44,906 --> 00:50:47,204
This makes a lot of sense.

631
00:50:47,275 --> 00:50:51,405
We go to bed a few hours ago,
it's 80 degrees. Now we're
freezin' our tails off.

632
00:50:51,479 --> 00:50:54,243
Hell's Bucket.
No rhyme or reason to it.

633
00:50:54,315 --> 00:50:56,977
That observation's
gettin' a little old.

634
00:50:57,051 --> 00:51:01,545
Christ!
Take a look.

635
00:51:01,622 --> 00:51:03,749
Azure Peak!

636
00:51:03,825 --> 00:51:06,385
Brr! Uh, could
somebody please turn up the heat?

637
00:51:06,461 --> 00:51:10,591
I told the man a thousand times
not to open the window
in the nanny's room.

638
00:51:10,665 --> 00:51:12,826
Arf, arf, arf!.

639
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:15,596
Good morning, Paps.

640
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:19,367
Ooh, my, isn't this weather
Christmassy?

641
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:23,501
Hey, let's make snow angels.
Come on, come!

642
00:51:23,578 --> 00:51:26,979
What're we going to do, Captain?
We can't just sit here
and freeze to death.

643
00:51:27,048 --> 00:51:29,278
No shit!
Okay, moron,

644
00:51:29,350 --> 00:51:32,319
you go stand in the bow
and let us know when
we're coming' close to ice.

645
00:51:32,386 --> 00:51:34,581
Skunk, Ted, you guys stand watch
port and starboard.

646
00:51:34,655 --> 00:51:38,455
Me and Paps will steer through
as best we can. Hey, woman!

647
00:51:38,526 --> 00:51:43,020
Shake your butt outta bed, Thumbelina,
we got a lot of work to do!

648
00:51:43,097 --> 00:51:45,531
Jesus.
Where the hell are we?

649
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:49,593
You just stay up there and
keep them mascara-caked eyes
of yours peeled for icebergs.

650
00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:52,366
- Can ya handle that?
- Kiss my ass!

651
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:55,932
Believe I'll pass on that one,
thank you very, much.

652
00:52:06,454 --> 00:52:10,322
- Okay, you hit one.
- Damn it, tell us before we hit
the bloody thing.

653
00:52:10,391 --> 00:52:13,155
Now I get it! Sorry,!

654
00:52:13,227 --> 00:52:17,288
This little system's
workin' out great.

655
00:52:20,034 --> 00:52:24,869
I don't know exactly what this means,
but a giant iceberg just winked at me.

656
00:52:24,939 --> 00:52:28,340
Not a promising development.

657
00:52:31,412 --> 00:52:33,505
Whoa, mama.

658
00:52:36,884 --> 00:52:40,911
I don't know how to break it
to you guys, but you're about
to make a new friend.

659
00:52:40,988 --> 00:52:43,047
What's she lippin' off
about now?

660
00:52:51,866 --> 00:52:55,029
A walkin' Popsicle!

661
00:52:55,102 --> 00:53:00,665
Sir, it is very, bad manners to pay
a visit without a formal invitation.

662
00:53:00,741 --> 00:53:04,609
I'm sorry,, I didn't catch that.
I have a trick ear.

663
00:53:07,982 --> 00:53:10,712
Quick, grab something
to whack him with!

664
00:53:10,785 --> 00:53:13,652
- What good'll that do?
- How should I know?
In a situation like this,

665
00:53:13,721 --> 00:53:15,655
you make up shit
as you go along!

666
00:53:15,723 --> 00:53:18,556
Now sic him! Come on, sic him!

667
00:53:23,297 --> 00:53:27,393
Come on, Skunk!
Poke his eye out or somethin'.

668
00:53:27,468 --> 00:53:31,529
I, I gotta make a phone call!

669
00:53:40,548 --> 00:53:42,675
What the hell ya doin'?

670
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:46,015
I think it's obvious.
I'm trying to give him foot pain.

671
00:53:46,087 --> 00:53:49,318
What? Get outta here!

672
00:53:49,390 --> 00:53:51,790
Crazy kid?

673
00:53:57,498 --> 00:54:01,832
- Keep 'im occupied, Ted.
- I got me an idea.

674
00:54:01,902 --> 00:54:04,598
Talk about an embarrassing obituary,!
Aah!

675
00:54:04,672 --> 00:54:07,766
Poked to death by
a giant human iceberg! Uuh!

676
00:54:13,914 --> 00:54:18,442
All right, you icy bastard!
How about a hot cup o' joe?

677
00:54:20,187 --> 00:54:22,815
Ha!

678
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:25,154
Sorry,, we're all outta decaf!.

679
00:54:25,226 --> 00:54:29,686
Melt, you frozen, goofy-lookin'
son-of-bitch! Melt!

680
00:54:29,764 --> 00:54:32,096
Get 'im!
Get 'im!

681
00:54:33,734 --> 00:54:35,702
Yeah!

682
00:54:38,939 --> 00:54:41,874
Finito!

683
00:54:43,944 --> 00:54:47,710
I've got it!

684
00:54:47,782 --> 00:54:52,014
Iced cappuccino.
Thank you, garcon.

685
00:54:54,088 --> 00:54:56,852
Yeah, get 'im! Get 'im!
Get 'im, Paps!

686
00:55:05,466 --> 00:55:10,028
Gives me the
double-dark willies just eye-ballin' it.

687
00:55:10,104 --> 00:55:14,040
It looks like
somethin' you'd dream about
after a quart of Jack Daniels...

688
00:55:14,108 --> 00:55:16,872
and a couple
of bad sausages.

689
00:55:16,944 --> 00:55:18,969
Whoo!

690
00:55:27,388 --> 00:55:31,586
Uh, we made it!
Uh, thank you! Thank you!

691
00:55:34,829 --> 00:55:37,525
- All right, already!
you're givin' me the creeps!

692
00:55:37,598 --> 00:55:40,567
Okay, let's not waste any time.
Here's what we need:

693
00:55:40,634 --> 00:55:44,570
driftwood, palm leaves, tree sap,
tree glue and a shit-load of gravel.

694
00:55:44,638 --> 00:55:47,038
- Why, are we going to bake a cake?
- The goal is to blow out of here...

695
00:55:47,108 --> 00:55:49,042
before sundown,
so no screwing around.

696
00:55:49,110 --> 00:55:52,375
I'd like to get me a fish in the boat
sometime before I'm 90.

697
00:56:01,121 --> 00:56:03,055
Hello.

698
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:19,438
Gentlemen, may I talk to you
about a subject which brings me
great embarrassment?

699
00:56:19,506 --> 00:56:23,306
Let me guess.
Your little swimmer friend is
giving you the old freeze job?

700
00:56:23,376 --> 00:56:26,709
I-I just don't get it. She seems
totally uninterested in me,

701
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:28,714
despite my smothering
obsessiveness.

702
00:56:28,782 --> 00:56:31,808
Did you ever try,
pattin' her on the ass?
That usually drives 'em wild.

703
00:56:31,885 --> 00:56:34,376
Or dance around the room
in your underwear
till she gets hot.

704
00:56:34,454 --> 00:56:36,319
That's how I got
my last four wives.

705
00:56:36,389 --> 00:56:40,155
- No, it's just no use.
- When it comes to women, I'm just--

706
00:56:40,226 --> 00:56:43,821
I'm all thumbs.
I'm just so stupid!

707
00:56:43,897 --> 00:56:45,865
Boom! Boom!

708
00:56:45,932 --> 00:56:49,333
Wait a sec.
Come to think of it,

709
00:56:49,402 --> 00:56:52,030
there is someone who could help you
with this problem of yours.

710
00:56:52,105 --> 00:56:57,407
Lordy, I know
what you're thinkin; Mr. Skunk.

711
00:56:57,477 --> 00:56:59,411
What? W-W-W-What?
What, what, what?

712
00:56:59,479 --> 00:57:03,438
Well, they say there's a woman
on this very, island...

713
00:57:03,516 --> 00:57:06,280
who's helped many a green,
young cabin boy come of age...

714
00:57:06,353 --> 00:57:08,844
and blossom
into manhood.

715
00:57:10,290 --> 00:57:13,020
In other words, she'll clean
your pipes six ways to Sunday.

716
00:57:13,093 --> 00:57:15,618
- You know what I mean?
- No, but go on.

717
00:57:15,695 --> 00:57:20,394
Well, the downside is,
she isn't real easy to get to.
She lives in a cave up on a cliff.

718
00:57:20,467 --> 00:57:24,631
I don't care.
I'll do whatever it takes
to win over Trina.

719
00:57:24,704 --> 00:57:28,800
How do I get to this woman?
Come on, give me precise
directions, will ya?

720
00:57:28,875 --> 00:57:32,242
Basically, you just saunter
your ass into the jungle.
You'll run into her eventually.

721
00:57:32,312 --> 00:57:34,906
All right, fine.
That's what I'm gonna do then.

722
00:57:34,981 --> 00:57:40,146
Thank you, fellow crewmates,
I'm off. And when I return,
I shall be a cabin man.

723
00:57:42,222 --> 00:57:44,417
¶

724
00:57:44,491 --> 00:57:46,823
SweetZeus,
he's off to meet Calli.

725
00:57:46,893 --> 00:57:51,227
And they never,
ever saw him again.

726
00:57:51,297 --> 00:57:54,494
The end!

727
00:57:54,567 --> 00:57:56,501
Whoo!

728
00:58:02,709 --> 00:58:04,677
Wowser!

729
00:58:11,051 --> 00:58:14,578
You're doing it.
You're actually climbing a cliff.

730
00:58:28,968 --> 00:58:30,902
Well, this is it.

731
00:58:30,970 --> 00:58:33,234
Good luck, Nathanial.
Be brave.

732
00:58:33,306 --> 00:58:35,501
I will be, Nathanial.
All right.

733
00:58:35,575 --> 00:58:37,167
Let's go, Nathanial. Okay.

734
00:58:37,243 --> 00:58:39,803
Hello.

735
00:58:39,879 --> 00:58:42,439
Hello?

736
00:58:42,515 --> 00:58:45,279
Howdy do?

737
00:58:45,351 --> 00:58:47,285
Uh--

738
00:58:57,464 --> 00:58:59,398
What th--

739
00:58:59,466 --> 00:59:01,491
Ooh-whee ¶

740
00:59:05,271 --> 00:59:09,765
- ¶Ooh, ooh, ooh-whee ¶
- Yeah. -

741
00:59:15,615 --> 00:59:19,847
Oo-ooh, ooh-whee-ee ¶

742
00:59:28,128 --> 00:59:30,221
- Excuse me, miss, uh--
-Have mercy ¶

743
00:59:31,998 --> 00:59:35,695
- Who are you?
- I'm, uh, young Nathanial,

744
00:59:35,769 --> 00:59:40,433
uh, cabin boy of The Filthy Whore,

745
00:59:40,507 --> 00:59:43,032
and I, um--

746
00:59:43,109 --> 00:59:46,840
See, Skunk said
that you were gonna--

747
00:59:46,913 --> 00:59:51,213
Do not be embarrassed,
cabin boy.

748
00:59:51,284 --> 00:59:54,048
I know why you are here.

749
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:58,921
You do? Great.
Well, that'll save us a lot of time.

750
00:59:58,992 --> 01:00:01,460
Geez, you must spend
a fortune on mittens.

751
01:00:01,528 --> 01:00:05,362
However, I cannot help you
with your problem...

752
01:00:05,431 --> 01:00:09,891
unless you answer
the three riddles of the island.

753
01:00:09,969 --> 01:00:12,369
Sure. That sounds like fun.
Hit me.

754
01:00:12,438 --> 01:00:17,637
How does the moon
greet her daughters?

755
01:00:17,710 --> 01:00:20,178
Yee... hoo.

756
01:00:23,049 --> 01:00:26,883
Well, if she's a refined
lady, and I'm sure she is,

757
01:00:26,953 --> 01:00:30,411
she may probably greet
her lassies with a gift of some sort.

758
01:00:30,490 --> 01:00:33,823
Uh, maybe a box of peppermints
or some hair care products,

759
01:00:33,893 --> 01:00:36,225
and then, you know,
it's off to the mall and lunch.

760
01:00:36,296 --> 01:00:38,730
""Have fun girls, bye-bye.''
That sort of thing.

761
01:00:40,633 --> 01:00:43,124
Why don't you ask me
something hard?

762
01:00:47,473 --> 01:00:51,967
What are the seven
contradictions of Zeripa,

763
01:00:52,045 --> 01:00:54,343
watcher of the equator?

764
01:00:56,015 --> 01:01:00,179
Geez!
I knew this too.

765
01:01:00,253 --> 01:01:02,517
Uh--

766
01:01:02,589 --> 01:01:06,787
Forget it.
Uh, you really-- This one you
got me completely stumped on.

767
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:09,795
I'm sorry,.
Does it have something to do
with the metric system?

768
01:01:09,863 --> 01:01:13,458
Forget it.
This is a waste of time.

769
01:01:13,533 --> 01:01:18,197
Come on over here, honey.
You've managed to charm me
with your moronic innocence.

770
01:01:18,271 --> 01:01:22,332
Great. Well, you know
what I always say:

771
01:01:22,408 --> 01:01:26,868
- ¶ Baby ¶ - It pays to be yourself.
 Uh--

772
01:01:26,946 --> 01:01:30,313
Come on, we've gotta finish before
my husband, Mulligan, comes home.

773
01:01:30,383 --> 01:01:35,047
- Okay.
-Your love is super-sweet love ¶

774
01:01:35,121 --> 01:01:38,522
- One down, five to go.
This could take all night.
-When you put it all--¶

775
01:01:40,393 --> 01:01:42,384
¶

776
01:01:42,462 --> 01:01:45,192
- Okay, you're gonna do that.
- Ooh.

777
01:01:45,265 --> 01:01:50,464
Ee! Geez, that's different,
isn't it? Uh-

778
01:01:56,709 --> 01:01:58,643
These pipes...

779
01:01:58,711 --> 01:02:02,112
are clean!

780
01:02:04,884 --> 01:02:08,081
And how.

781
01:02:22,502 --> 01:02:25,027
Hello, Trina.

782
01:02:25,104 --> 01:02:27,231
What happened to you?

783
01:02:29,175 --> 01:02:33,544
Well, let's just say I've finally
shed my feminine side

784
01:02:33,613 --> 01:02:36,741
like a snake sheds its fur.

785
01:02:36,816 --> 01:02:40,684
You look so strong... confident.

786
01:02:40,753 --> 01:02:43,620
- Yeah. 
- Not nearly as idiotic.

787
01:02:50,730 --> 01:02:54,666
I'm now going to show you
everything I've been taught.

788
01:02:54,734 --> 01:02:58,727
I only pray that I'm not thrown off
by your lack of four additional arms.

789
01:03:11,261 --> 01:03:15,197
Hi, honey.
How was your day at the shop?

790
01:03:15,265 --> 01:03:17,460
Sweet of you to call it a shop, Calli.

791
01:03:17,534 --> 01:03:20,765
We both know it's just a hole
in the side of a mountain.

792
01:03:20,837 --> 01:03:23,704
- Was business brisk?
- Brisk?

793
01:03:23,773 --> 01:03:29,143
Not really. I sold one electric
toothbrush to a flyin' leprechaun.

794
01:03:29,212 --> 01:03:31,146
Well, don't be
discouraged, dear.

795
01:03:31,214 --> 01:03:33,341
I'm sure things will pick up
once word of mouth gets out.

796
01:03:33,416 --> 01:03:36,579
Who am I kidding?

797
01:03:36,653 --> 01:03:39,713
It was a stupid idea
to open up a housewares store
on this island.

798
01:03:39,789 --> 01:03:43,850
I might as well go back to devourin'
wild boar and sleep on the beach.

799
01:03:43,927 --> 01:03:45,918
Stop talking like that.

800
01:03:45,996 --> 01:03:49,090
What the hell is this?

801
01:03:52,235 --> 01:03:55,568
Uh, it's Linda's.
She must've left it here.

802
01:03:55,639 --> 01:03:59,507
What are you talkin' about?
Your sister hasn't visited in months.

803
01:04:04,114 --> 01:04:06,048
Frozen seafood.

804
01:04:07,951 --> 01:04:10,215
There was a fisherman here,
wasn't there?

805
01:04:10,287 --> 01:04:14,781
Of course not.
Where would you get that silly idea?

806
01:04:14,858 --> 01:04:18,021
What do you call this?

807
01:04:20,163 --> 01:04:22,654
Uh--

808
01:04:22,732 --> 01:04:27,931
Damn it, woman! You promised me
when we were married,
you'd quit helping lonely sailors.

809
01:04:28,004 --> 01:04:32,532
You don't understand. It's boring
laying around this dump all day.

810
01:04:32,609 --> 01:04:34,907
Least you have a job
to go off to.

811
01:04:34,978 --> 01:04:39,438
No! I told you
a long time ago, no wife
of mine is ever gonna work.

812
01:04:39,516 --> 01:04:42,212
Where are you going?

813
01:04:42,285 --> 01:04:46,312
I'm going to kick me
some sailor-boy ass.

814
01:04:46,389 --> 01:04:48,550
Bring back bread.

815
01:04:48,625 --> 01:04:52,789
It's beautiful countryside,
isn't it?

816
01:04:52,862 --> 01:04:56,559
Kinda reminds me
of Long Island City.

817
01:04:56,633 --> 01:04:59,227
Hey, where the hell
are they going?

818
01:04:59,302 --> 01:05:03,602
Wonderful! The boys must
have fixed the boat and they're
taking it out for a test drive.

819
01:05:03,673 --> 01:05:06,938
- Congrats, gents!
- Don't you understand?

820
01:05:07,010 --> 01:05:10,537
Those idiots are leaving us here.
We're completely abandoned.

821
01:05:10,613 --> 01:05:15,141
Trina, would you have
a little faith in mankind?
They would never do that to me.

822
01:05:15,218 --> 01:05:17,652
I've become one of them.
We've bonded.

823
01:05:17,721 --> 01:05:20,656
Nathanial,
how can you be so naive?

824
01:05:20,724 --> 01:05:22,885
Well, how can you just
stand there like that and just--

825
01:05:25,528 --> 01:05:27,519
Holy crap!

826
01:05:29,299 --> 01:05:34,794
A little birdie inside my brain is
telling me that that's probably Mulligan.

827
01:05:34,871 --> 01:05:39,308
He's found out about me and Calli,
and now he must think that
I'm out there on the boat.

828
01:05:39,376 --> 01:05:42,140
Can you see the question mark
above my head?

829
01:05:42,212 --> 01:05:44,146
Yeah, well, it's a complicated story,.
I'll fill you in on it later.

830
01:05:44,214 --> 01:05:46,148
But right now, we have to go
help our friends.

831
01:05:46,216 --> 01:05:49,674
Why? They left us here to rot.
I hope he kills 'em all.

832
01:05:49,753 --> 01:05:54,315
- Kill! Kill! Destroy!
- Stop it. Trina, stop!

833
01:05:54,391 --> 01:05:57,519
As your recently trained lover,
I'm ordering you to assist me.

834
01:05:57,594 --> 01:06:00,028
Wow.

835
01:06:00,096 --> 01:06:05,762
Nathanial, no man's ever
talked to me like that
without eating my knuckles.

836
01:06:05,835 --> 01:06:11,330
For some reason, when you say it,
I actually like it.

837
01:06:11,408 --> 01:06:15,071
Geez! Okay, okay, keep it in your
pants for five seconds, will ya, honey?

838
01:06:15,145 --> 01:06:17,705
Come on, we're on an official
rescue mission here. Let's go.

839
01:06:19,449 --> 01:06:23,647
Holy Christ
in a dump truck!

840
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:27,486
Skunk?
Mr. Expert?

841
01:06:27,557 --> 01:06:31,425
Mr. Mythology Whiz,
what the hell is that?

842
01:06:31,494 --> 01:06:35,157
I have no idea.
just a big guy, I guess.

843
01:06:35,231 --> 01:06:38,962
We gotta head him off
before he gets his grubby hands
on The Filthy Whore! Move!

844
01:06:39,035 --> 01:06:41,503
Move! Move!

845
01:06:57,587 --> 01:07:00,522
Which one of you scumbags
diddled my wife?

846
01:07:00,590 --> 01:07:05,152
Come on, mister, don't be sore at us.
We didn't diddle nobody,
especially your wife.

847
01:07:05,228 --> 01:07:09,858
If there's one thing I hate,
it's a wiseass.

848
01:07:19,609 --> 01:07:23,602
Hurry,, Trina! Faster, faster!

849
01:07:26,282 --> 01:07:29,183
Come on.
Go, girl, go.

850
01:07:29,252 --> 01:07:32,415
All right, Trina,
I'll take it from here.

851
01:07:32,489 --> 01:07:34,457
Ooh!

852
01:07:34,524 --> 01:07:38,051
I stabbeth thee,
ye wretched giant...

853
01:07:38,128 --> 01:07:40,926
shoe salesman-looking creature!

854
01:07:40,997 --> 01:07:43,727
Hey!

855
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:46,860
Now what should I do?

856
01:07:46,936 --> 01:07:51,532
Kill you separately, or toss you
in the boat with your little
friends and then sit on it?

857
01:07:51,608 --> 01:07:57,103
No! It was me who made sweet
love to your receptive wife.
The others are innocent.

858
01:07:57,180 --> 01:08:01,310
Do you know what I do
to guys who, quote unquote,
sleep with my wife?

859
01:08:01,384 --> 01:08:05,650
Discuss your disappointment
with them over a cup
of hot chocolate?

860
01:08:05,722 --> 01:08:07,280
¶Close ¶¶

861
01:08:07,357 --> 01:08:10,087
I cut their heads off
with a nail clipper.

862
01:08:11,628 --> 01:08:15,257
- Come here, you little rat bastard.
- Uh--

863
01:08:15,331 --> 01:08:19,131
Ya know, I think
I'll pass on that, um--

864
01:08:19,202 --> 01:08:21,500
But I'd be happy to take
you up on a leg waxing.

865
01:08:21,571 --> 01:08:24,506
Don't you guys
have any guns or anything?
Can't we do something?

866
01:08:24,574 --> 01:08:28,670
Yeah, look the other way.
This is gonna be gruesome.

867
01:08:35,084 --> 01:08:36,483
Die!

868
01:08:38,588 --> 01:08:42,957
- It's Chocki!
- I guess he's still got a soft
spot for the kid after all.

869
01:09:13,122 --> 01:09:15,522
Yes!

870
01:09:18,461 --> 01:09:20,656
Big dummy.
Yeah!

871
01:09:20,730 --> 01:09:23,494
Must come... down!

872
01:09:33,810 --> 01:09:37,246
That-a-boy! I knew you'd do it.

873
01:09:37,313 --> 01:09:39,873
Yes!

874
01:09:39,949 --> 01:09:43,282
Yeah.

875
01:09:45,655 --> 01:09:49,557
Ahmm-moo-baa!

876
01:09:49,626 --> 01:09:51,753
Way to go, kid!

877
01:09:55,431 --> 01:09:58,594
Good-bye, sweet Chocki.
I shan't forget you.

878
01:09:58,668 --> 01:10:02,263
Half man, half shark...

879
01:10:02,338 --> 01:10:05,034
equals one
complete gentleman.

880
01:10:11,681 --> 01:10:14,377
- Here you go.
Help him up here. Come on.
- Atta boy.

881
01:10:14,450 --> 01:10:16,850
Hi.

882
01:10:17,923 --> 01:10:20,517
- Whoo!
- Yeah! Ha-ha!

883
01:10:20,592 --> 01:10:23,618
I'm so proud of you,
Nathanial.

884
01:10:23,695 --> 01:10:28,064
That was the most courageous
and bizarre thing I've ever seen.

885
01:10:28,133 --> 01:10:31,864
You saved our lives, kid.
I knew ya had it in ya.

886
01:10:31,937 --> 01:10:36,374
You're the best cabin boy
ever, you little monkey!

887
01:10:36,441 --> 01:10:38,375
Not bad for a Jonah.

888
01:10:38,443 --> 01:10:43,403
Here's a switch: You play
and we'll dance for you!

889
01:10:43,482 --> 01:10:45,382
¶

890
01:11:09,708 --> 01:11:12,734
Well, uh, I guess
I got everything.

891
01:11:12,811 --> 01:11:16,076
What's wrong, pally?
This ain't no time to drag
your ass. You got it made now.

892
01:11:16,148 --> 01:11:20,608
I guess you'll be eatin' off of
silver slippers from here on out?

893
01:11:20,686 --> 01:11:24,486
That's right. No more fish sticks
and chocolate milk for our cabin boy!

894
01:11:26,792 --> 01:11:30,626
Fellas, I was just thinking.
I'm sure my daddy would give you
all jobs at the hotel.

895
01:11:32,464 --> 01:11:35,991
Come on, squirt.
We're just a bunch of old,
broken-down fishermen.

896
01:11:36,068 --> 01:11:38,434
All we know
how to do is fish.

897
01:11:38,503 --> 01:11:40,994
- And stink.
- Right.

898
01:11:41,073 --> 01:11:43,303
But the sea is part
of me now too.

899
01:11:43,375 --> 01:11:47,505
It courses through my veins
and through my organs
and through my bladder.

900
01:11:47,579 --> 01:11:52,915
Now, don't be silly, champ.
Your place is here with your papa.
You know that.

901
01:11:52,985 --> 01:11:57,820
You're a fancy lad and
you ought to be proud of it.

902
01:12:03,228 --> 01:12:06,823
My big Teddy. Thanks.

903
01:12:06,899 --> 01:12:11,427
Yeah, see ya, kid. Go get yourself
a couple of high-priced Hawaiian
whores for me?

904
01:12:11,503 --> 01:12:14,165
Okay.

905
01:12:14,239 --> 01:12:16,173
Skunk.

906
01:12:16,241 --> 01:12:18,607
Take care, kid.

907
01:12:18,677 --> 01:12:20,702
Paps.

908
01:12:20,779 --> 01:12:25,580
Paps, you've been like the drunken,
abusive grandfather I never had.

909
01:12:25,651 --> 01:12:29,883
Stop that. You'll have
my glass eye foggin' over. Here.

910
01:12:31,256 --> 01:12:35,750
Cappy, you're the hardest one
to say good-bye to.

911
01:12:35,827 --> 01:12:38,523
I felt closest to you
throughout all of this.

912
01:12:38,597 --> 01:12:41,964
You're kind of like the scarecrow
in that classic children's story,.

913
01:12:42,034 --> 01:12:45,299
- The Wizard of Oz.
- No, I'm fairly certain it was
The Great Gatsby.

914
01:12:45,370 --> 01:12:49,830
Uh--
Good luck, Butch.

915
01:12:49,908 --> 01:12:53,036
Fish sticks ain't gonna
be the same without ya.

916
01:12:53,111 --> 01:12:56,547
All right, don't, don't do that.
You're going to get me going.

917
01:12:56,615 --> 01:12:59,379
- Get out! Get, get!
- I-I'm-- Okay.

918
01:13:03,422 --> 01:13:07,256
Trina? Trina,
what's your problem?

919
01:13:07,326 --> 01:13:10,420
What?
Are you drunk or something?

920
01:13:12,431 --> 01:13:15,423
Nathanial,

921
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:18,697
it could never
work out with us.

922
01:13:18,770 --> 01:13:22,706
You have this whole fancy life
waiting for you here.

923
01:13:22,774 --> 01:13:25,436
I can't be part of that.

924
01:13:33,151 --> 01:13:35,711
May I charter you
a private jet for your trip home?

925
01:13:35,787 --> 01:13:39,689
No. Thanks, but I plan to
swim back right after I grab lunch.

926
01:13:43,362 --> 01:13:46,354
Okay, a handshake. Well, uh,
a handshake's good, I guess.

927
01:13:46,431 --> 01:13:48,456
Good-bye, Nathanial.

928
01:13:48,533 --> 01:13:52,230
Good-bye, Trina.

929
01:13:52,304 --> 01:13:56,206
Well, I'm off then.

930
01:13:56,274 --> 01:13:58,208
Good-bye, everyone.

931
01:13:58,276 --> 01:14:03,373
May your days be full of mirth
and good fortune.

932
01:14:03,448 --> 01:14:05,712
Bye.

933
01:14:05,784 --> 01:14:07,979
Good-bye.

934
01:14:18,530 --> 01:14:23,593
Look at you.
Dirty, shabby, common-looking.

935
01:14:23,668 --> 01:14:25,602
Well, I hope you're happy.

936
01:14:25,670 --> 01:14:30,300
You have the honor of being the first
Mayweather to smell a bit gamy.

937
01:14:32,210 --> 01:14:37,238
I smell of the sea, and there's
no smell more honest or admirable.

938
01:14:37,315 --> 01:14:39,340
My God!
You're delirious!

939
01:14:39,418 --> 01:14:42,410
Nathanial, what are we
going to do with you?

940
01:14:44,743 --> 01:14:47,644
Where in the Savior's name
are you going?

941
01:14:50,815 --> 01:14:53,283
This is for you!

942
01:14:53,351 --> 01:14:57,583
Come back here, boy!
You're out of your mind.

943
01:15:03,228 --> 01:15:05,253
Nathanial?

944
01:15:05,330 --> 01:15:07,491
Trina! Trina.

945
01:15:11,636 --> 01:15:13,604
Trina, you're still here.

946
01:15:13,671 --> 01:15:15,696
Yeah, I was just about to head out.

947
01:15:15,774 --> 01:15:18,299
My steak and eggs are
pretty well digested.

948
01:15:18,376 --> 01:15:23,473
Listen to me. I wanna spend
the rest of my life with you at sea,

949
01:15:23,548 --> 01:15:27,314
with the crew of The Filthy Whore,
like one big, happy,

950
01:15:27,385 --> 01:15:30,513
pungent,
mildly dysfunctional family.

951
01:15:30,588 --> 01:15:32,681
Are you sure
this is what you want?

952
01:15:32,757 --> 01:15:35,692
Yeah! I am sure.

953
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:38,092
I've permanently yanked
the silver spoon from my mouth,

954
01:15:38,163 --> 01:15:41,030
and I buried it 6,000 miles
beneath the Earth's crust.

955
01:15:41,099 --> 01:15:43,124
I mean, figuratively
speaking, of course.

956
01:15:43,201 --> 01:15:46,364
I mean, who could do such a thing?
That would be insane.

957
01:15:46,438 --> 01:15:47,200
Nathanial.

958
01:15:47,272 --> 01:15:49,900
Your words melt
like butter in my brain.

959
01:16:01,820 --> 01:16:04,118
Come on, Trina.

960
01:16:04,189 --> 01:16:06,623
We've got a boat to catch.

961
01:18:50,622 --> 01:18:54,615
¶

962
01:18:54,692 --> 01:18:57,456
Ooh-whee ¶

963
01:19:01,132 --> 01:19:05,831
Ooh, ooh-whee-ee ¶

Ooh-whee-ee ¶

Ooh-ooh-ooh-whee ¶

Ooh-ooh-whee ¶

Ooh-whee ¶¶
