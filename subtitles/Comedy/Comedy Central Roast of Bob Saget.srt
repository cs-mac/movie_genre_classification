00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:38,498
Holy.

162
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:42,498
John, you--

163
00:07:42,499 --> 00:07:45,498
John, you lost your wife
to the fat kid

164
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:47,499
from <i>stand by me.</i>

165
00:07:49,499 --> 00:07:51,498
Holy shit.

166
00:07:51,499 --> 00:07:54,498
Look at you,
you greasy Greek bastard.

167
00:07:54,499 --> 00:07:55,498
I look at you and I wonder,

168
00:07:55,499 --> 00:07:57,498
how can there be
an energy crisis?

169
00:07:57,499 --> 00:07:58,498
We shouldn't be drilling
in Alaska.

170
00:07:58,499 --> 00:08:04,498
We should be wringing out
your family's pillowcases.

171
00:08:04,499 --> 00:08:08,375
Norm MacDonald is here,
one of the funniest people ever.

172
00:08:08,376 --> 00:08:09,498
Norm's got
a giant gambling problem.

173
00:08:09,499 --> 00:08:11,498
He's dropped more coin
in a casino

174
00:08:11,499 --> 00:08:14,498
than Michael j. Fox
at a parking meter.

175
00:08:14,499 --> 00:08:16,498
It's a fucking roast.

176
00:08:16,499 --> 00:08:18,498
Groany-groan-groan.

177
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:23,498
Brian posehn, look at him,
that giant fucking ghoul.

178
00:08:23,499 --> 00:08:26,498
We've all seen you shirtless
on <i>the Sarah silverman</i> show.

179
00:08:26,499 --> 00:08:27,498
It's hard to believe
you could be so out of shape

180
00:08:27,499 --> 00:08:29,498
considering how often
the townspeople

181
00:08:29,499 --> 00:08:31,499
must chase you around
with torches.

182
00:08:36,499 --> 00:08:38,498
The great cloris leachman,
of course, is here.

183
00:08:38,499 --> 00:08:40,498
Cloris leachman, yup.

184
00:08:40,499 --> 00:08:43,499
[Cheers and applause]

185
00:08:46,499 --> 00:08:47,498
Cloris is so old

186
00:08:47,499 --> 00:08:51,498
she lost her virginity
to a druid.

187
00:08:51,499 --> 00:08:52,498
What are you doing here, cloris?

188
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:54,498
You're the only person
with any talent.

189
00:08:54,499 --> 00:08:56,498
You won an Oscar and nine emmys.

190
00:08:56,499 --> 00:08:57,498
When it comes to winning awards,

191

than jon lovitz

Jon lovitz,

a more effeminate Jew

Susie essman, look at you.
You're a mess.

197
00:09:25,499 --> 00:09:29,498
You're like screech with tits.

198
00:09:29,499 --> 00:09:34,498
I guess cloris leachman is here
to make you seem fuckable.

199
00:09:34,499 --> 00:09:38,498
Gilbert gottfried's here.
Gilbert recently had a baby.

200
00:09:38,499 --> 00:09:39,498
Who would fuck you?

201
00:09:39,499 --> 00:09:42,499
You have the sex appeal
of a school bus fire.

202
00:09:46,499 --> 00:09:47,498
Which brings me
to the man of the hour,

203
00:09:47,499 --> 00:09:49,498
Bob saget, everybody, huh?

Bob--

207
00:09:55,499 --> 00:10:00,498
Bob, you are a genital wart
on the cock of American culture.

208
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:04,498
Seriously, who gives a shit
about Bob saget?

209
00:10:04,499 --> 00:10:07,498
With your long neck,
pointy beak, and granny glasses,

210
00:10:07,499 --> 00:10:11,498
you're like
the vlasic pickle stork.

211
00:10:11,499 --> 00:10:13,498
Except instead
of delivering babies,

212
00:10:13,499 --> 00:10:15,499
you're not funny.

213
00:10:19,499 --> 00:10:20,498
You're like
my seven-year-old son.

214
00:10:20,499 --> 00:10:22,498
You think cursing is hilarious,

215
00:10:22,499 --> 00:10:23,498
and you're not surprised
your dick

216
00:10:23,499 --> 00:10:27,498
is the same size it was
in the first grade.

217
00:10:27,499 --> 00:10:29,498
And where the hell
are the Olsen twins?

218
00:10:29,499 --> 00:10:31,498
The olsens
are like tom green's testicles.

219
00:10:31,499 --> 00:10:34,498
They look the same, but one
is fake and empty inside,

220
00:10:34,499 --> 00:10:38,498
and the other one's been licked
by heath ledger.

He'd be cool with it, fuckers.

222
00:10:42,499 --> 00:10:44,498
I read an interview
where you referred to yourself

223
00:10:44,499 --> 00:10:45,498
as an artist.

224
00:10:45,499 --> 00:10:47,498
Are you fucking kidding me?

225
00:10:47,499 --> 00:10:48,498
As an artist?

226
00:10:48,499 --> 00:10:50,498
You used the phrase,
"as an artist"?

227
00:10:50,499 --> 00:10:53,498
You are a vortex
of artistic compromise.

228
00:10:53,499 --> 00:10:58,498
Charlie sheen watches you
and feels good about himself.

229
00:10:58,499 --> 00:10:59,498
You--

230
00:10:59,499 --> 00:11:00,498
you are an artist
in the same way

231

You're not an artist, Bob,

234
00:11:10,499 --> 00:11:13,498
and stop enjoying
your ironic hipness

235
00:11:13,499 --> 00:11:14,498
that's going on
with you these days.

236
00:11:14,499 --> 00:11:16,498
You're not cool.

237
00:11:16,499 --> 00:11:17,498
Stop trying to be hip.

238
00:11:17,499 --> 00:11:20,498
At one point in your act,
you actually say,

239
00:11:20,499 --> 00:11:22,498
"who's your daddy?
Say my name.

240

244
00:11:33,499 --> 00:11:35,498
I'm done being mean, Bob.
I've met you a bunch of times.

245
00:11:35,499 --> 00:11:38,498
You've always been hilarious
and super cool,

246
00:11:38,499 --> 00:11:40,498
and everybody that knows you
loves and respects you.

247
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:42,498
Nobody ever has a bad thing
to say about you,

248
00:11:42,499 --> 00:11:45,498
and that's
particularly surprising,

249
00:11:45,499 --> 00:11:47,498
because you're Jewish,

250
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:49,498
and you're obnoxious people.

251
00:11:49,499 --> 00:11:50,498

Our next roaster

00:12:14,491 --> 00:12:16,490
Tonight he's debuting a
character he's been working on:

260
00:12:16,491 --> 00:12:18,490

Geraldo Rivera?

265
00:12:42,491 --> 00:12:44,490
Yes.

266
00:12:44,491 --> 00:12:46,490
I tell you, that's
the first time I've been roasted

00:12:46,491 --> 00:12:49,490
by an illegal alien.

268
00:12:49,491 --> 00:12:52,490
You know, Bob's
a good friend of mine.

269
00:12:52,491 --> 00:12:54,490
He's probably one
of my best friends,

270
00:12:54,491 --> 00:12:56,490
and there's been a rumor
going around Los Angeles

271
00:12:56,491 --> 00:13:00,490
for the last 50 years
that Bob is gay.

272
00:13:00,491 --> 00:13:01,490
And he's not gay.

273
00:13:01,491 --> 00:13:03,490
You know, he's got
a beautiful wife,

274
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:07,490
beautiful girlfriend.

275
00:13:07,491 --> 00:13:09,490
So I'd like to sing
some songs now

276
00:13:09,491 --> 00:13:11,490
to kill the rumor
that he's gay.

277
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:15,490
And this first song is called
<i>Bob saget isn't gay</i>

278
00:13:15,491 --> 00:13:17,490
and hopefully
will kill the rumors that he is,

279
00:13:17,491 --> 00:13:19,490
which he is not.

He's a wonderful man
named Ben saget.

297

Ben saget was so proud
of his son's success,

298

he wrote a book about it.

The book is a loving tribute
from a father to his son.

<i>"catch the drippings in a cup,</i>

318
00:15:20,491 --> 00:15:24,490
<i>"pour them back</i>
<i>into me intravenously</i>

319
00:15:24,491 --> 00:15:27,491
<i>vs. 100."</i>

320
00:15:30,491 --> 00:15:33,491
I'd read you more,
but it starts to get gross.

321
00:15:36,491 --> 00:15:39,490
Good-bye, everybody!
Good-bye!

322
00:15:39,491 --> 00:15:42,491
[Cheers and applause]

323
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:51,490
- For your safety,
please avert your eyes

324
00:15:51,491 --> 00:15:54,490
and welcome
the pork roastmaster general

325
00:15:54,491 --> 00:15:56,490
Jeffrey Ross.

326
00:15:56,491 --> 00:15:59,491
[Cheers and applause]

327
00:16:03,491 --> 00:16:06,491
Wow, give it up for chachi.

328
00:16:10,491 --> 00:16:12,490
Ladies, I spoke to flavor flav.

329
00:16:12,491 --> 00:16:14,491
He said you can be on the show.

330
00:16:17,491 --> 00:16:20,490
They're still here
from last year's roast.

331
00:16:20,491 --> 00:16:23,490
Wow.

332
00:16:23,491 --> 00:16:24,490
I know this is a big night,

333
00:16:24,491 --> 00:16:28,490
because cloris leachman
put her teeth in.

334
00:16:28,491 --> 00:16:30,490
Wow, what a legend.

335
00:16:30,491 --> 00:16:33,491
Shakespeare did <i>her</i> in the park.

336
00:16:39,491 --> 00:16:42,491
You look great, babe,
not a day over dead.

337
00:16:44,491 --> 00:16:48,491
She come her in a limo
or a time machine?

338
00:16:50,491 --> 00:16:52,490
Wow, doesn't Lisa lampanelli
look fant--

339
00:16:52,491 --> 00:16:56,491
oh, that's Jeff garlin.
Sorry.

340
00:17:00,491 --> 00:17:02,490
Norm MacDonald's so stoned

341
00:17:02,491 --> 00:17:04,491
he thinks he's at a roast
for Bob seger.

342
00:17:07,491 --> 00:17:09,490
I love you, norm.

343
00:17:09,491 --> 00:17:11,490
Wow, you never come out, norm.

344
00:17:11,491 --> 00:17:13,491
You're like the j.D. Salinger
of dick jokes.

345
00:17:15,491 --> 00:17:16,490
Ugh.

346
00:17:16,491 --> 00:17:19,490
Of course, Bob saget directed
norm MacDonald's movie,

347
00:17:19,491 --> 00:17:20,490
<i>dirty work.</i>

348
00:17:20,491 --> 00:17:22,491
Yeah.

349
00:17:25,491 --> 00:17:28,490
A move that transformed
norm MacDonald into a star...

350
00:17:28,491 --> 00:17:30,491
Bucks employee.

351
00:17:33,491 --> 00:17:35,490
- Did you say something
after "star"?

352
00:17:35,491 --> 00:17:38,490
- What's the over-under tonight?
What's gonna happen, norm?

353
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:39,490
- No, I wanted
to read something funny,

354
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:41,490
so I'm reading <i>marmaduke.</i>

355
00:17:41,491 --> 00:17:43,490
- [Laughs]

356
00:17:43,491 --> 00:17:44,490
Oh, my God.

357
00:17:44,491 --> 00:17:46,491
This is what happens when
you book a dais off craigslist.

358
00:17:49,491 --> 00:17:51,490
Jon lovitz, great job tonight.

359
00:17:51,491 --> 00:17:54,490
Jon lovitz is single out there,
ladies, if you're single.

360
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:56,490
Yeah.

361
00:17:56,491 --> 00:17:58,490
Jon lovitz went on match.Com.

362
00:17:58,491 --> 00:18:03,490
They paired him up with a couch
and a bottle of hand lotion.

363
00:18:03,491 --> 00:18:04,490
Yeah.

364
00:18:04,491 --> 00:18:06,490
That's a three-way for him.

365
00:18:06,491 --> 00:18:08,490
[Laughs]

366
00:18:08,491 --> 00:18:10,490
And Dave coulier,
in case you think

367
00:18:10,491 --> 00:18:13,491
we forgot about you, we did.

368
00:18:15,491 --> 00:18:17,490
Oh.

369
00:18:17,491 --> 00:18:18,490
But, ladies and gentlemen,
I'm here today

370
00:18:18,491 --> 00:18:21,490
because I only roast
the ones I love,

371
00:18:21,491 --> 00:18:23,490
and I love Bob saget.

372
00:18:23,491 --> 00:18:24,490
I love him--

373
00:18:24,491 --> 00:18:25,490
I love him
like a perverted Uncle

374
00:18:25,491 --> 00:18:27,490
who pays for lunch

375
00:18:27,491 --> 00:18:31,490
and then follows me
into the men's room.

376
00:18:31,491 --> 00:18:34,490
Bob saget is a sick bastard.

377
00:18:34,491 --> 00:18:35,490
He has two daughters in college

378
00:18:35,491 --> 00:18:40,490
and three girlfriends
in high school.

379
00:18:40,491 --> 00:18:42,490
Bob saget's girlfriend
is so young,

380
00:18:42,491 --> 00:18:45,491
r. Kelly wouldn't pee on her.

381
00:18:50,491 --> 00:18:51,490
Most comics dream
of performing

382
00:18:51,491 --> 00:18:53,490
in Las Vegas, Nevada.

383
00:18:53,491 --> 00:18:56,491
Bob saget dreams of performing
in <i>Hannah Montana.</i>

384
00:19:00,491 --> 00:19:02,490
<i>Full house</i> should've
been called <i>Blackjack,</i>

385
00:19:02,491 --> 00:19:04,490
'cause he hit on the olsens
when they were eight.

386
00:19:04,491 --> 00:19:08,490
He didn't stop
till they were 21.

387
00:19:08,491 --> 00:19:11,490
Is it true you used to give
Mary-Kate acting lessons?

388
00:19:11,491 --> 00:19:15,490
He'd tell her,
"act like this never happened."

389
00:19:15,491 --> 00:19:18,491
She'd be like,
"you got it, dude."

390
00:19:25,491 --> 00:19:28,490
Actually, Mary-Kate and Ashley

391
00:19:28,491 --> 00:19:29,490
were supposed
to be here tonight,

392
00:19:29,491 --> 00:19:31,491
but they heard
there was gonna be food.

393
00:19:35,491 --> 00:19:37,490
And although Bob saget
is not an insult comic,

394
00:19:37,491 --> 00:19:40,491
I am insulted
when people call him a comic.

395
00:19:43,491 --> 00:19:45,490
But if some of us
use dirty words as a crutch,

396
00:19:45,491 --> 00:19:48,490
then Bob saget
must be a quadriplegic.

397
00:19:48,491 --> 00:19:50,490
- [Laughs]

398
00:19:50,491 --> 00:19:52,490
- But here's one
four-letter word

399
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:54,490
I know he's never heard:

400
00:19:54,491 --> 00:19:56,491
Haha.

401
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:01,490
Bob, in case you haven't
figured it out yet,

402
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:02,490
this isn't a roast.

403
00:20:02,491 --> 00:20:04,490
It's an intervention.

404
00:20:04,491 --> 00:20:07,491
You can keep doing drugs,
but please stop doing comedy.

405
00:20:09,491 --> 00:20:11,490
Please.

406
00:20:11,491 --> 00:20:15,490
The people have spoken.

407
00:20:15,491 --> 00:20:17,490
And, Bob, you may have noticed

408
00:20:17,491 --> 00:20:19,490
I didn't use
any curse words tonight,

409
00:20:19,491 --> 00:20:22,490
'cause I didn't want
to compete with the master.

410
00:20:22,491 --> 00:20:25,490
Out of all the comics I know,
you have the filthiest mouth

411
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:26,490
and the kindest heart,

412
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:29,490
and I knew there was no way
I could top you.

413
00:20:29,491 --> 00:20:32,490
But in honor of the late,
great George carlin,

414
00:20:32,491 --> 00:20:34,490
I would like to leave you
all with another seven words

415
00:20:34,491 --> 00:20:37,490
you can never hear
on television:

416
00:20:37,491 --> 00:20:40,490
And the emmy goes
to Bob saget.

417
00:20:40,491 --> 00:20:43,491
[Cheers and applause]

418
00:21:02,147 --> 00:21:03,146
That's all I got to say,

419
00:21:03,147 --> 00:21:05,146
'cause that's the punch line.

420
00:21:05,147 --> 00:21:07,146
Bob saget.

421
00:21:07,147 --> 00:21:08,146
[Laughs]

422
00:21:08,147 --> 00:21:11,146
It doesn't even need a setup.

423
00:21:11,147 --> 00:21:14,146
Bob, did you really need
a roast?

424
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:16,146
Your career
wasn't enough of one?

425
00:21:16,147 --> 00:21:18,146
<i>Full house.</i>

426
00:21:18,147 --> 00:21:20,146
Are you kidding me?

427
00:21:20,147 --> 00:21:23,146
What the fuck was that about?

428
00:21:23,147 --> 00:21:26,146
I think it's based
on what passes through the brain

429
00:21:26,147 --> 00:21:28,146
of a comatose child molester.

430
00:21:28,147 --> 00:21:32,146
It was like watching a stroke
in slow motion.

431
00:21:32,147 --> 00:21:35,146
<i>America's funniest home videos.</i>

432
00:21:35,147 --> 00:21:37,146
Were they, Bob?

433
00:21:37,147 --> 00:21:39,146
Were they really the funniest?

434
00:21:39,147 --> 00:21:40,481
How'd you do it, Bob?

435
00:21:40,482 --> 00:21:42,146
How the fuck did you do it?

436
00:21:42,147 --> 00:21:44,146
Why did you do it?

437
00:21:44,147 --> 00:21:46,146
To make me feel better
about my career,

438
00:21:46,147 --> 00:21:48,146
which at that point
was in the dumpsters--

439
00:21:48,147 --> 00:21:51,146
I played pisshole clubs
across the country--

440
00:21:51,147 --> 00:21:53,146
so I can feel better
about myself,

441
00:21:53,147 --> 00:21:55,146
so I could think, "well,
things are shitty,

442
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,146
"but at least I'm not saget.

443
00:21:57,147 --> 00:21:58,146
"I'm just a stripper.

444
00:21:58,147 --> 00:22:00,146
At least I'm not a whore."

445
00:22:00,147 --> 00:22:03,146
Well, I got to go.

446
00:22:03,147 --> 00:22:04,146
All the best, Bob.

447
00:22:04,147 --> 00:22:05,146
And, stamos,

448
00:22:05,147 --> 00:22:08,147
you are so gay.

449
00:22:15,147 --> 00:22:18,146
I tried to get
our next roaster's autograph.

450
00:22:18,147 --> 00:22:21,146
Then I realized
she wasn't gene Simmons.

451
00:22:21,147 --> 00:22:24,146
Please welcome
the least attractive cast member

452
00:22:24,147 --> 00:22:28,146
on <i>curb your enthusiasm,</i>
susie essman.

453
00:22:28,147 --> 00:22:31,147
[Cheers and applause]

454
00:22:35,147 --> 00:22:37,146
- Thank you, pretty boy.

455
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:40,146
I had no idea, John,
you had such a sharp tongue.

456
00:22:40,147 --> 00:22:43,147
That must really hurt
saget's ass.

457
00:22:46,147 --> 00:22:49,146
You know, Bob, I was talking
about your career the other day,

458
00:22:49,147 --> 00:22:52,146
and out of nowhere,
a fat lady started singing.

459
00:22:52,147 --> 00:22:56,146
It was so weird.

460
00:22:56,147 --> 00:22:57,146
Most of you don't know that Bob

461
00:22:57,147 --> 00:22:59,146
is the complete opposite
of his image.

462
00:22:59,147 --> 00:23:03,146
His image, by the way, is funny.

463
00:23:03,147 --> 00:23:06,146
Jeff, my darling husband--
not in real life.

464
00:23:06,147 --> 00:23:08,146
But you know,
you know I love you.

465
00:23:08,147 --> 00:23:09,146
People are always
fascinated by Jeff,

466
00:23:09,147 --> 00:23:12,146
and they're always asking me,
"is Jeff really fat?"

467
00:23:12,147 --> 00:23:16,147
No, the camera adds 465 pounds.

468
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:20,146
Doesn't matter.
You're funny.

469
00:23:20,147 --> 00:23:22,146
Doesn't matter
if you're a fat fuck,

470
00:23:22,147 --> 00:23:23,146
'cause you're funny, right?

471
00:23:23,147 --> 00:23:24,146
That's all that really matters.

472
00:23:24,147 --> 00:23:25,146
Lot of funny here.

473
00:23:25,147 --> 00:23:28,146
This dais is graced
with many, many fine comedians

474
00:23:28,147 --> 00:23:30,146
and Bob saget.

475
00:23:30,147 --> 00:23:31,146
- [Laughs]

00:23:31,147 --> 00:23:33,146
- What do you get
when you cross Gilbert gottfried

477
00:23:33,147 --> 00:23:34,146
with Jim Norton?

478
00:23:34,147 --> 00:23:38,146
I don't know, but you wouldn't
want to fuck it.

479
00:23:38,147 --> 00:23:42,146
Greg giraldo: The reason
vaginal dryness was invented.

480
00:23:42,147 --> 00:23:45,146
Stamos, you're doable,
but I wouldn't,

481
00:23:45,147 --> 00:23:48,146
because you're one of those
narcissistic good-looking boys,

482
00:23:48,147 --> 00:23:50,146
like the kind of guy
who calls out his own name

483
00:23:50,147 --> 00:23:52,147
when he's cumming.

484
00:23:56,565 --> 00:23:58,146
Let's face it.

485
00:23:58,147 --> 00:24:00,146
The only one
who's getting screwed tonight

486
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:04,146
is Bob saget.

487
00:24:04,147 --> 00:24:06,146
Bob is one of those people who
every time you see him on TV,

488
00:24:06,147 --> 00:24:09,146
you think, "whose dick
did he suck to get that gig?"

489
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:10,146
You know?

490
00:24:10,147 --> 00:24:12,146
Bob spends more times
on his knees

491
00:24:12,147 --> 00:24:13,146
after a big audition

492
00:24:13,147 --> 00:24:16,147
than Mary-Kate does
after a big meal.

493
00:24:19,147 --> 00:24:21,146
Bob will do anything for money.

494
00:24:21,147 --> 00:24:22,146
That's why he's always
getting into cars

495
00:24:22,147 --> 00:24:23,146
on Santa Monica boulevard.

496
00:24:23,147 --> 00:24:25,146
And for years, I thought
he just needed a ride.

497
00:24:25,147 --> 00:24:27,146
You know, I'm such an innocent.

498
00:24:27,147 --> 00:24:29,146
You know,
and I met your girlfriend.

499
00:24:29,147 --> 00:24:30,146
She's lovely.

500
00:24:30,147 --> 00:24:31,146
And one good thing we know

501
00:24:31,147 --> 00:24:33,147
is at least she's not
a star fucker.

502
00:24:37,147 --> 00:24:39,146
The reason I'm here
is because

503
00:24:39,147 --> 00:24:40,146
it was a challenge to me.

504
00:24:40,147 --> 00:24:42,146
I love to putter in the kitchen,

505
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,146
and this was an opportunity
I couldn't pass up,

506
00:24:44,147 --> 00:24:47,146
because I've baked a cake,
I've fried a chicken,

507
00:24:47,147 --> 00:24:49,146
and this is the first time
I had a chance

508
00:24:49,147 --> 00:24:51,146
to roast an asshole.

509
00:24:51,147 --> 00:24:54,146
So I figured
I would just show up and do it.

510
00:24:54,147 --> 00:24:56,146
And you know, I just got
a text message

511
00:24:56,147 --> 00:24:57,146
from my self-respect,

512
00:24:57,147 --> 00:24:58,397
and it said I have to leave.

513
00:24:58,398 --> 00:25:01,146
So good night, everybody.

514
00:25:01,147 --> 00:25:02,146
Thank you.

515
00:25:02,147 --> 00:25:05,147
[Cheers and applause]

516
00:25:12,147 --> 00:25:14,146
- We're lucky to have
our next comic, Brian.

517
00:25:14,147 --> 00:25:16,146
After the roast,
he's got to get back

518
00:25:16,147 --> 00:25:20,146
to the cabin in the woods
to skin some teenagers.

519
00:25:20,147 --> 00:25:22,146
To avoid startling the creature,

520
00:25:22,147 --> 00:25:26,146
please no flash photography
for Brian posehn.

521
00:25:26,147 --> 00:25:29,147
[Cheers and applause]

522
00:25:39,147 --> 00:25:41,146
- Keep it going for John stamos.

523
00:25:41,147 --> 00:25:44,147
[Cheers and applause]

524
00:25:46,147 --> 00:25:47,146
Wow, John.

525
00:25:47,147 --> 00:25:48,146
If you and I were at a party,

526
00:25:48,147 --> 00:25:53,146
our cocks would have nothing
to talk about.

527
00:25:53,147 --> 00:25:55,146
[Chuckles]

528
00:25:55,147 --> 00:25:57,146
Your dick has
a more impressive resume

529
00:25:57,147 --> 00:26:01,146
than you do.

530
00:26:01,147 --> 00:26:02,146
You know what?
I don't even know Bob saget.

531
00:26:02,147 --> 00:26:03,146
I've met him twice.

532
00:26:03,147 --> 00:26:05,146
I'm only here
because Lisa lampanelli

533
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:08,147
finally got murdered
by one of her black boyfriends.

534
00:26:12,147 --> 00:26:15,146
That's right.

535
00:26:15,147 --> 00:26:16,146
Norm MacDonald is here.

536
00:26:16,147 --> 00:26:19,146
He does an amazing
Burt Reynolds impression.

537
00:26:19,147 --> 00:26:23,147
And by that, I mean he's not
in movies anymore either.

538
00:26:27,147 --> 00:26:28,146
Jodie sweetin's in the crowd.

539
00:26:28,147 --> 00:26:30,146
Remember her?

540
00:26:30,147 --> 00:26:31,146
Yeah.

541
00:26:31,147 --> 00:26:33,146
[Cheers and applause]

542
00:26:33,147 --> 00:26:35,146
I can't point her out,
but she's the <i>full house</i> girl

543
00:26:35,147 --> 00:26:37,146
that isn't a crazy Christian

544
00:26:37,147 --> 00:26:39,146
or a vagina on a stick.

545
00:26:39,147 --> 00:26:41,146
So, uh--

546
00:26:41,147 --> 00:26:44,146
Jodie sweetin, by the way,
hosted this terrible cable show

547
00:26:44,147 --> 00:26:46,146
called <i>pants-off dance-off.</i>

548
00:26:46,147 --> 00:26:47,146
Yeah.

549
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:51,147
Which is how I
used to watch <i>full house.</i>

550
00:26:52,147 --> 00:26:55,146
That's right.

551
00:26:55,147 --> 00:26:59,146
Yeah, how about Jeffrey Ross,
my buddy?

552
00:26:59,147 --> 00:27:00,146
Yeah, yeah.

553
00:27:00,147 --> 00:27:03,146
[Cheers and applause]

554
00:27:03,147 --> 00:27:05,146
Jeff wants to be
an old comic so bad

555
00:27:05,147 --> 00:27:07,147
that he's having
his balls lowered.

556
00:27:13,147 --> 00:27:16,146
Cloris leachman, look at you.

557
00:27:16,147 --> 00:27:19,147
You're older than the dirt
you sleep in.

558
00:27:23,147 --> 00:27:27,146
Ah, that's so mean.

559
00:27:27,147 --> 00:27:31,146
Susie, I know what it's like
to be called ugly like you.

560
00:27:31,147 --> 00:27:33,146
I do.
I--my whole life.

561
00:27:33,147 --> 00:27:35,146
Don't take it
personally, though,

562
00:27:35,147 --> 00:27:38,147
'cause if you were a chick,
I would totally fuck you.

563
00:27:42,147 --> 00:27:46,146
Seriously, I came here
to honor Bob saget.

564
00:27:46,147 --> 00:27:48,146
Yeah.

565
00:27:48,147 --> 00:27:51,146
[Cheers and applause]

566
00:27:51,147 --> 00:27:53,146
That's right.

567
00:27:53,147 --> 00:27:54,146
Bob has done a lot
for this country.

568
00:27:54,147 --> 00:27:57,146
For eight seasons,
half an hour a week,

569
00:27:57,147 --> 00:28:01,146
<i>full house</i> kept pedophiles
off the street.

570
00:28:01,147 --> 00:28:05,146
In fact, three of them
were on the show.

571
00:28:05,147 --> 00:28:07,146
Bob, I love
how you reinvented yourself

572
00:28:07,147 --> 00:28:09,146
as this dirty comic,
you know?

573
00:28:09,147 --> 00:28:13,146
But it worked a few times,
and now no one cares.

574
00:28:13,147 --> 00:28:16,146
You're like the boy
who cried, "cunt."

575
00:28:16,147 --> 00:28:18,146
- [Laughs]

576
00:28:18,147 --> 00:28:22,146
- But, Bob, you've been
a big influence on me, man.

577
00:28:22,147 --> 00:28:25,146
When Sarah silverman asked me
to play a gay guy on TV,

578
00:28:25,147 --> 00:28:27,146
I didn't want to.

579
00:28:27,147 --> 00:28:29,147
But then I thought, "hey, if
saget can do it..."

580
00:28:34,147 --> 00:28:37,146
Bob, in all seriousness,
and I mean this deeply,

581
00:28:37,147 --> 00:28:41,146
I hope horrible things
happen to you

582
00:28:41,147 --> 00:28:45,146
tonight and for the rest
of your pitiful life.

583
00:28:45,147 --> 00:28:46,146
I'm kidding, buddy.

584
00:28:46,147 --> 00:28:47,146
Congratulations,
and have a good night.

585
00:28:47,147 --> 00:28:49,146
Thanks, you guys.

586
00:28:49,147 --> 00:28:52,147
[Cheers and applause]

587
00:28:59,952 --> 00:29:02,951
- Our next roaster
has never been to a roast,

588
00:29:02,952 --> 00:29:07,328
but in 1620, she was almost
burned as a witch.

589
00:29:11,952 --> 00:29:14,952
Her first std was the plague.

590
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:19,951
Please welcome cloris leachman!

591
00:29:19,952 --> 00:29:22,952
[Cheers and applause]

592
00:29:37,952 --> 00:29:43,951
- I am not here
to roast Bob saget.

593
00:29:43,952 --> 00:29:46,952
I'm here to fuck John stamos.

594
00:30:01,952 --> 00:30:03,951
Stamos, you shouldn't
talk so much.

595
00:30:03,952 --> 00:30:06,951
Your mouth is canceling out
all the hard work

596
00:30:06,952 --> 00:30:09,952
your ass is doing.

597
00:30:12,952 --> 00:30:14,951
If you play your cards right,
I'll do something

598
00:30:14,952 --> 00:30:17,951
no woman has ever done to you:

599
00:30:17,952 --> 00:30:20,952
Put you in the movies.

600
00:30:27,952 --> 00:30:30,951
Does any one of you
actually know who I am?

601
00:30:30,952 --> 00:30:32,951
I was on
the <i>Mary Tyler Moore</i> show.

602
00:30:32,952 --> 00:30:35,952
[Cheers and applause]

603
00:30:37,953 --> 00:30:41,951
Total slut, by the way.

604
00:30:41,952 --> 00:30:45,951
She taught me everything I know.

605
00:30:45,952 --> 00:30:48,951
Here's something
you don't know about Mary.

606
00:30:48,952 --> 00:30:52,952
When she had an orgasm,
she threw her hat in the air.

607
00:30:56,952 --> 00:31:01,951
I don't know
who any of you people is.

608
00:31:01,952 --> 00:31:03,951
Maybe that's 'cause I watch TV
and go to the movies

609
00:31:03,952 --> 00:31:06,952
and read the trades.

610
00:31:14,952 --> 00:31:18,951
I have vibrators older
than most of you.

611
00:31:18,952 --> 00:31:20,951
The difference is,
my vibrators still work.

612
00:31:20,952 --> 00:31:22,952
They do.

613
00:31:28,952 --> 00:31:31,952
You, the fat one.

614
00:31:39,952 --> 00:31:43,952
Not you, the ugly fat one.

615
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:55,951
Yeah, your name is Jeff Ross?

616
00:31:55,952 --> 00:31:57,951
- Yeah.

617
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:00,951
- I just want to thank you
for doing the jokes

618
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:03,952
my father used to tell me
when I was seven.

619
00:32:08,952 --> 00:32:12,952
I'm sure this is the first time
you've ever made a woman happy.

620
00:32:16,952 --> 00:32:20,951
None of this dirty joke stuff
is shocking to me.

621
00:32:20,952 --> 00:32:23,951
I mean, during the golden era
of comedy,

622
00:32:23,952 --> 00:32:25,951
I broke my ankle
when I tripped over

623
00:32:25,952 --> 00:32:27,952
Milton berle's cock.

624
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:36,952
Which one of you fellas
is susie essman?

625
00:32:41,952 --> 00:32:45,951
Normie MacDonald.

626
00:32:45,952 --> 00:32:47,951
I've never met you before,
but I want you to know

627
00:32:47,952 --> 00:32:50,952
I'm carrying mace.

628
00:32:53,952 --> 00:32:54,951
Norm can't stay much longer.

629
00:32:54,952 --> 00:32:59,952
He has to get his suit back
to his father's coffin.

630
00:33:06,952 --> 00:33:08,951
I'm an academy award winner.

631
00:33:08,952 --> 00:33:09,951
For the love of God,

632
00:33:09,952 --> 00:33:11,951
will someone please
punch me in the face

633
00:33:11,952 --> 00:33:13,952
so I can see some stars?

634
00:33:26,952 --> 00:33:30,952
I can't believe
I shaved for this.

635
00:33:34,952 --> 00:33:36,951
I mean, what am I even
doing here?

636
00:33:36,952 --> 00:33:39,951
Who cares about Bob saget?

637
00:33:39,952 --> 00:33:41,951
I was giving reach arounds
to Jack Benny

638
00:33:41,952 --> 00:33:44,952
before you were born.

639
00:33:47,952 --> 00:33:50,952
And that man had timing.

640
00:33:54,952 --> 00:33:56,951
I was actually offered a role
on <i>full house.</i>

641
00:33:56,952 --> 00:33:58,951
I turned it down,
'cause I wanted

642
00:33:58,952 --> 00:34:03,951
to focus on comedy.

643
00:34:03,952 --> 00:34:06,952
I'm glad I got out of sitcoms
before you killed them.

644
00:34:09,952 --> 00:34:11,951
You didn't just kill sitcoms.

645
00:34:11,952 --> 00:34:14,952
You raped them and left them
for dead in a ditch...

646
00:34:17,952 --> 00:34:21,952
Just like I did
with Gavin macleod in 1975.

647
00:34:25,952 --> 00:34:29,952
And then again in 1978,
that bald bitch.

648
00:34:34,952 --> 00:34:38,951
Bob, dearest,

649
00:34:38,952 --> 00:34:41,951
I've seen some of your work.

650
00:34:41,952 --> 00:34:44,951
And you're not an actor.

651
00:34:44,952 --> 00:34:47,951
Not one of you is.

652
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:50,951
I was classically trained
in live theater.

653
00:34:50,952 --> 00:34:52,951
I improvised.
No script, no director.

654
00:34:52,952 --> 00:34:56,952
Just me and the donkey.

655
00:35:03,952 --> 00:35:06,951
Five sold out shows a night
for six years

656
00:35:06,952 --> 00:35:10,951
till the donkey died
of exhaustion.

657
00:35:10,952 --> 00:35:14,951
Then I was finally ready
for Hollywood.

658
00:35:14,952 --> 00:35:17,951
What have you nothings done?

659
00:35:17,952 --> 00:35:21,952
"My YouTube video
has 400 hits."

660
00:35:26,952 --> 00:35:30,952
Fuck a donkey,
then talk to me.

661
00:35:32,952 --> 00:35:35,951
Now, get up here, stamos.
Let's see what you got.

662
00:35:35,952 --> 00:35:38,952
[Cheers and applause]

663
00:35:52,952 --> 00:35:55,952
You're very funny.

664
00:36:10,142 --> 00:36:12,141
- You.

665
00:36:12,142 --> 00:36:16,141
Our next roaster used to be
on <i>Saturday night live.</i>

666
00:36:16,142 --> 00:36:18,141
Now he just watches it,

667
00:36:18,142 --> 00:36:22,141
well, up until last week
when a hooker stole his TV.

668
00:36:22,142 --> 00:36:26,141
Please welcome
the incoherent norm MacDonald.

669
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:29,142
[Cheers and applause]

670
00:36:38,142 --> 00:36:39,141
- Yeah, I want to start
with John stamos,

671
00:36:39,142 --> 00:36:41,141
our esteemed roastmaster.

672
00:36:41,142 --> 00:36:43,141
John--well, John
has a reputation

673
00:36:43,142 --> 00:36:45,267
for being a bit of a swinger.

674
00:36:45,268 --> 00:36:47,141
Did you know instead
of an umbilical cord,

675
00:36:47,142 --> 00:36:50,142
John was born
with a bungee cord?

676
00:36:55,142 --> 00:36:56,141
And cloris leachman is here.

677
00:36:56,142 --> 00:36:58,141
Cloris?

678
00:36:58,142 --> 00:37:01,142
[Cheers and applause]

679
00:37:03,142 --> 00:37:05,141
Cloris, if people say
you're over the hill,

680
00:37:05,142 --> 00:37:06,141
don't believe them.

681
00:37:06,142 --> 00:37:07,141
Why, you'll never be
over the hill,

682
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:10,142
not in the car you drive.

683
00:37:14,142 --> 00:37:16,141
Greg giraldo is here.

684
00:37:16,142 --> 00:37:19,141
He has the grace of a swan,
the wisdom of an owl,

685
00:37:19,142 --> 00:37:20,141
and the eye of an eagle.

686
00:37:20,142 --> 00:37:23,142
Ladies and gentleman,
this man is for the birds.

687
00:37:42,142 --> 00:37:44,141
Susie essman, of course,

688
00:37:44,142 --> 00:37:47,141
is famous
for being a vegetarian.

689
00:37:47,142 --> 00:37:50,141
Hey, she may be a vegetarian,

690
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:51,141
but she's still full of bologna
in my book.

691
00:37:51,142 --> 00:37:53,142
I--

692
00:37:58,142 --> 00:38:02,141
Gilbert gottfried,
one of my best friends.

693
00:38:02,142 --> 00:38:03,141
I love Gilbert.

694
00:38:03,142 --> 00:38:05,141
When you go
to the men's room later,

695
00:38:05,142 --> 00:38:07,141
you'll see a sign
that says, "gentlemen,"

696
00:38:07,142 --> 00:38:08,141
pay no heed.

697
00:38:08,142 --> 00:38:10,142
Go right in.

698
00:38:15,142 --> 00:38:18,142
There's no room
that says "scoundrel" on it.

699
00:38:20,142 --> 00:38:23,141
But now we come to Bob saget,
and that's why we're all here.

700
00:38:23,142 --> 00:38:25,141
Bob.

701
00:38:25,142 --> 00:38:28,142
[Cheers and applause]

702
00:38:30,142 --> 00:38:33,141
Bob, you have a lot
of well wishers here tonight,

703
00:38:33,142 --> 00:38:35,141
and a lot of them would like
to throw you down one--

704
00:38:35,142 --> 00:38:37,141
a well.

705
00:38:37,142 --> 00:38:42,141
They want to murder you
in a well.

706
00:38:42,142 --> 00:38:45,141
Seems a little harsh, but--

707
00:38:45,142 --> 00:38:48,141
apparently, they want
to murder you in a well,

708
00:38:48,142 --> 00:38:51,142
it says here on this card.

709
00:38:54,142 --> 00:38:56,141
No, but Bob has
a beautiful face

710
00:38:56,142 --> 00:38:57,141
like a flower--

711
00:38:57,142 --> 00:39:00,142
yeah, a cauliflower.

712
00:39:04,142 --> 00:39:08,141
No offense, but your face

713
00:39:08,142 --> 00:39:10,141
looks

714
00:39:10,142 --> 00:39:15,141
like a cauliflower.

715
00:39:15,142 --> 00:39:17,141
Now, I heard you have hair
on your chest, Bob.

716
00:39:17,142 --> 00:39:20,141
And, well, let me
tell you something.

717
00:39:20,142 --> 00:39:22,141
That isn't your only resemblance

718
00:39:22,142 --> 00:39:24,141
to rin tin tin.

719
00:39:24,142 --> 00:39:28,141
- [Laughs]

720
00:39:28,142 --> 00:39:30,142
- You're a fucking dogface.

721
00:39:34,142 --> 00:39:36,142
How can you not get that?

722
00:39:42,142 --> 00:39:46,141
No, there are times when Bob
has something on his mind:

723
00:39:46,142 --> 00:39:49,142
When he wears a hat.

724
00:39:53,142 --> 00:39:55,141
But no thoughts at all.

725
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:59,141
Just a hat.

726
00:39:59,142 --> 00:40:02,141
And Bob isn't
the biggest sports fan.

727
00:40:02,142 --> 00:40:04,141
I don't think I'm telling
any tales out of school.

728
00:40:04,142 --> 00:40:07,141
I took him to a--

729
00:40:07,142 --> 00:40:09,141
I took him
to a ball game,

730
00:40:09,142 --> 00:40:12,141
and he came toting
a double-barreled shotgun.

731
00:40:12,142 --> 00:40:14,141
Do you remember that?

732
00:40:14,142 --> 00:40:19,141
I said, "what the 'h'
is that for?"

733
00:40:19,142 --> 00:40:23,141
Bob said, "I heard the lions
were playing the tigers."

734
00:40:23,142 --> 00:40:24,141
Do you remember that?

735
00:40:24,142 --> 00:40:25,142
- Yeah.

736
00:40:31,142 --> 00:40:33,141
- No, he's a good guy.
He's a good guy.

737
00:40:33,142 --> 00:40:35,141
He's never bought
Christmas seals.

738
00:40:35,142 --> 00:40:38,142
He told me he wouldn't know
what to feed them.

739
00:40:40,142 --> 00:40:45,141
This concludes the joke--

740
00:40:45,142 --> 00:40:48,142
[cheers and applause]

741
00:40:50,142 --> 00:40:53,141
In all seriousness,
Bob was the first comedian

742
00:40:53,142 --> 00:40:58,141
that I ever saw perform
when I was a boy live,

743
00:40:58,142 --> 00:41:00,141
and I loved him.

744
00:41:00,142 --> 00:41:03,141
But one thing
that bonds us as comedians is,

745
00:41:03,142 --> 00:41:05,141
we're bitter and jealous,

746
00:41:05,142 --> 00:41:08,141
and we hate everyone else
that has any success.

747
00:41:08,142 --> 00:41:14,141
But Bob honestly has never
had an unkind word for anybody,

748
00:41:14,142 --> 00:41:15,141
and I love him,

749
00:41:15,142 --> 00:41:17,141
and I hope everybody else does,

750
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:19,141
so I just wanted to say that.

751
00:41:19,142 --> 00:41:21,141
Thank you.

752
00:41:21,142 --> 00:41:24,142
[Cheers and applause]

753
00:41:32,142 --> 00:41:34,141
- Norm MacDonald.

754
00:41:34,142 --> 00:41:37,141
[Cheers and applause]

755
00:41:37,142 --> 00:41:40,141
We're very lucky
to have our next roaster.

756
00:41:40,142 --> 00:41:42,141
He's a legend.

757
00:41:42,142 --> 00:41:44,141
The executive
who bought <i>full house</i>

758
00:41:44,142 --> 00:41:46,141
to network television:

759
00:41:46,142 --> 00:41:48,141
Sol Schwartz.

760
00:41:48,142 --> 00:41:51,142
[Cheers and applause]

761
00:41:59,142 --> 00:42:05,141
- I remember the day
that they came to me

762
00:42:05,142 --> 00:42:08,141
with the <i>full house</i> pitch.

763
00:42:08,142 --> 00:42:11,141
It was the last day
my assistant jaclyn blew me.

764
00:42:11,142 --> 00:42:14,141
I remember it clearly.

765
00:42:14,142 --> 00:42:17,141
And in walked in
the <i>full house</i> people.

766
00:42:17,142 --> 00:42:20,141
And they pitched
their little show,

767
00:42:20,142 --> 00:42:23,141
their dream show,
their classic.

768
00:42:23,142 --> 00:42:26,141
And I said, "it's a yes,

769
00:42:26,142 --> 00:42:28,141
"but I want it to star
three schmucks

770
00:42:28,142 --> 00:42:30,141
"I've never heard of.

771
00:42:30,142 --> 00:42:33,142
'Cause I want to prove
that time slot is everything."

772
00:42:38,142 --> 00:42:42,141
Let me tell you something,
John stamos.

773
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:47,141
You are the most talented actor
that I have ever come across.

774
00:42:47,142 --> 00:42:48,141
You are wonderful.

775
00:42:48,142 --> 00:42:50,141
You're delightful.

776
00:42:50,142 --> 00:42:51,141
You're a dream!

777
00:42:51,142 --> 00:42:54,141
You're fantastic.

778
00:42:54,142 --> 00:42:57,141
No one has ever touched
your talent.

779
00:42:57,142 --> 00:42:59,141
It is remarkable.

780
00:42:59,142 --> 00:43:02,141
You are the best performer
I have ever seen.

781
00:43:02,142 --> 00:43:05,141
No one in the world
has ever come close

782
00:43:05,142 --> 00:43:09,976
to the magic that you bring
to the stage, to the screen.

783
00:43:09,977 --> 00:43:13,141
My balls are clapping.

784
00:43:13,142 --> 00:43:17,142
You are truly God's
favorite actor, John stamos.

785
00:43:20,142 --> 00:43:24,141
Oh, by the way, I've already
read tomorrow's <i>variety.</i>

786
00:43:24,142 --> 00:43:25,141
I get it early.

787
00:43:25,142 --> 00:43:28,142
You've been replaced on <i>er</i>
by Jerry O'Connell.

788
00:43:32,142 --> 00:43:35,141
It's true.

789
00:43:35,142 --> 00:43:38,141
Let's talk about a true mensch,

790
00:43:38,142 --> 00:43:41,141
my pride and joy,
who I discovered 25 years ago,

791
00:43:41,142 --> 00:43:43,141
Bob saget.

792
00:43:43,142 --> 00:43:44,141
I'm not--
[Cheers and applause]

793
00:43:44,142 --> 00:43:46,141
Yes.

794
00:43:46,142 --> 00:43:50,141
I think you're more
than just the sitcom dad

795
00:43:50,142 --> 00:43:53,141
or the guy who hosts
that video show.

796
00:43:53,142 --> 00:43:55,141
You're really one
of the shittiest comics

797
00:43:55,142 --> 00:43:58,141
I've ever seen.

798
00:43:58,142 --> 00:44:00,141
The other day, I--

799
00:44:00,142 --> 00:44:02,141
after all these years,
I'd never met the Olsen twins.

800
00:44:02,142 --> 00:44:04,141
He introduced me to them.

801
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:06,141
I said to him,
"how do I tell them apart?"

802
00:44:06,142 --> 00:44:10,142
He says, "Ashley swallows."

803
00:44:15,142 --> 00:44:18,141
What's my character's name
again?

804
00:44:18,142 --> 00:44:19,141
Saul Schwartz.

805
00:44:19,142 --> 00:44:22,141
Bob--he called him sol.

806
00:44:22,142 --> 00:44:24,141
John stamos is so not Jewish.

807
00:44:24,142 --> 00:44:28,141
"Please welcome sol Schwartz."

808
00:44:28,142 --> 00:44:30,141
[Laughs]

809
00:44:30,142 --> 00:44:31,141
The truth is, Bob,

810
00:44:31,142 --> 00:44:34,141
we've worked together
for many, many years,

811
00:44:34,142 --> 00:44:36,141
and I'm starting to think
I have Alzheimer's,

812
00:44:36,142 --> 00:44:37,141
because I can't remember

813
00:44:37,142 --> 00:44:41,141
a single funny thing
you ever said.

814
00:44:41,142 --> 00:44:43,141
All right,
I'm not fucking around.

815
00:44:43,142 --> 00:44:45,141
I said to them before the show--

816
00:44:45,142 --> 00:44:47,141
I said, "I want to say
something nice about him now,"

817
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:51,141
and I swear, on the screen,
it says, "sincere moment."

818
00:44:51,142 --> 00:44:54,142
[Laughs]

819
00:44:56,142 --> 00:44:58,141
What a sincere moment.

820
00:44:58,142 --> 00:45:00,141
No, what I want to say
to you is,

821
00:45:00,142 --> 00:45:01,141
we never hang out.

822
00:45:01,142 --> 00:45:04,141
I'd like to.

823
00:45:04,142 --> 00:45:06,141
We see each other.

824
00:45:06,142 --> 00:45:08,141
We're always happy
to see each other.

825
00:45:08,142 --> 00:45:09,141
I've always liked you.

826
00:45:09,142 --> 00:45:11,141
And I remember
when we first met,

827
00:45:11,142 --> 00:45:13,141
you asked me
if I knew how dry

828
00:45:13,142 --> 00:45:14,141
my grandma's vagina was.

829
00:45:14,142 --> 00:45:16,141
Those were the first thing--
- really?

830
00:45:16,142 --> 00:45:18,141
- I was opening for you
in the '80s,

831
00:45:18,142 --> 00:45:20,141
and that's the first thing
you said to me,

832
00:45:20,142 --> 00:45:23,141
and I knew that I liked you
from that moment on.

833
00:45:23,142 --> 00:45:24,141
Isn't that a fantastic--

834
00:45:24,142 --> 00:45:26,141
you ever met somebody--

835
00:45:26,142 --> 00:45:29,141
"hey, do you know how dry
your grandma's vagina is?"

836
00:45:29,142 --> 00:45:31,141
That's fucking great!

837
00:45:31,142 --> 00:45:34,141
You know he's a great person.

838
00:45:34,142 --> 00:45:36,141
But I think the world of you.

839
00:45:36,142 --> 00:45:39,141
And for me, it was an honor
to be here tonight.

840
00:45:39,142 --> 00:45:41,141
Thanks.

841
00:45:41,142 --> 00:45:44,142
[Cheers and applause]

842
00:45:52,981 --> 00:45:54,981
- We're roasting Bob saget?

843
00:45:55,182 --> 00:45:57,181
I heard that Bob saget

844
00:45:57,182 --> 00:46:00,181
calls his balls
the Olsen twins.

845
00:46:00,182 --> 00:46:01,181
And that's actually--

846
00:46:01,182 --> 00:46:05,181
I know for a fact
that's not true, because

847
00:46:05,182 --> 00:46:07,181
he calls them Michelle.

848
00:46:07,182 --> 00:46:10,181
Greg giraldo,
it's like I don't--

849
00:46:10,182 --> 00:46:12,181
I think he's hispanic.

850
00:46:12,182 --> 00:46:14,181
He's, like,
nine different things.

851
00:46:14,182 --> 00:46:15,181
He's, like,
nine different nationalities.

852
00:46:15,182 --> 00:46:17,181
Or maybe eight.

853
00:46:17,182 --> 00:46:19,181
I don't know.
Is gay a nationality?

854
00:46:19,182 --> 00:46:22,181
Norm, Jim Norton,
Greg giraldo--

855
00:46:22,182 --> 00:46:23,181
why don't they just--

856
00:46:23,182 --> 00:46:25,181
they should've done the roast
at the racetrack,

857
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:29,181
you know, where norm works.

858
00:46:29,182 --> 00:46:31,181
Oh, who's the, like,
really pretty little girl

859
00:46:31,182 --> 00:46:33,181
from <i>full house?</i>

860
00:46:33,182 --> 00:46:35,181
Oh, um,

861
00:46:35,182 --> 00:46:36,641
John stamos.

862
00:46:36,642 --> 00:46:39,181
He's hosting it.

863
00:46:39,182 --> 00:46:41,181
That should be good.

864
00:46:41,182 --> 00:46:45,181
I wish so much that I could be
at the roast in person,

865
00:46:45,182 --> 00:46:47,181
but I, um--

866
00:46:47,182 --> 00:46:49,181
just after everything
I've been through lately,

867
00:46:49,182 --> 00:46:51,181
I really need
to be around people

868
00:46:51,182 --> 00:46:54,181
that can make me laugh.

869
00:46:54,182 --> 00:46:57,181
I got Bob's mother
to tape something.

870
00:46:57,182 --> 00:47:00,182
And I just got it,
so let's look at it.

871
00:47:03,182 --> 00:47:07,181
- Bobby, what a son.

872
00:47:07,182 --> 00:47:08,181
[Laughs]

873
00:47:08,182 --> 00:47:11,181
I was proud of you
when you were bar mitzvahed,

874
00:47:11,182 --> 00:47:12,181
and when you got married

875
00:47:12,182 --> 00:47:15,181
and had
those wonderful children.

876
00:47:15,182 --> 00:47:20,181
And all those millions
you made on <i>full house</i>

877
00:47:20,182 --> 00:47:22,181
and <i>America's home videos.</i>

878
00:47:22,182 --> 00:47:26,181
And oh, if I had
to do it over again,

879
00:47:26,182 --> 00:47:29,181
I'd probably get an abortion.

880
00:47:29,182 --> 00:47:30,181
- [Sighs]

881
00:47:30,182 --> 00:47:32,182
God, I know that's Bob's mother,

882
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:34,181
and it was so sweet of her
to do that,

883
00:47:34,182 --> 00:47:35,181
but I just hate that.

884
00:47:35,182 --> 00:47:39,181
I hate when people
use words like "abortion"

885
00:47:39,182 --> 00:47:40,181
just for a laugh.

886
00:47:40,182 --> 00:47:41,557
You know what I mean?
It's cheap.

887
00:47:41,558 --> 00:47:45,181
It's like--it's lazy comics
just getting a laugh

888
00:47:45,182 --> 00:47:46,181
with shock value,

889
00:47:46,182 --> 00:47:53,181
especially when it
comes to susie essman's cunt.

890
00:47:53,182 --> 00:47:56,182
[Cheers and applause]

891
00:48:01,182 --> 00:48:04,181
- Many comics on this dais
have worked holes in the wall.

892
00:48:04,182 --> 00:48:09,181
Our next roaster
just sucked a cock through one.

893
00:48:09,182 --> 00:48:11,181
You can see him
on the Internet sensation,

894
00:48:11,182 --> 00:48:15,181
<i>one guy, two cups, and a baby.</i>

895
00:48:15,182 --> 00:48:18,182
From meganslaw.Com...

896
00:48:20,182 --> 00:48:24,181
It's the Uncle fester
of unfunny, Jim Norton.

897
00:48:24,182 --> 00:48:27,182
[Cheers and applause]

898
00:48:32,182 --> 00:48:33,181
- Oh, thank you.

899
00:48:33,182 --> 00:48:35,181
How about a nice hand
for John stamos?

900
00:48:35,182 --> 00:48:36,182
Isn't he terrific?

901
00:48:40,182 --> 00:48:42,181
This is, honest to God,
the biggest collection

902
00:48:42,182 --> 00:48:45,181
of non-celebrities
I've ever seen in an audience.

903
00:48:45,182 --> 00:48:48,181
You know you have a shit crowd
when Alonzo bodden

904
00:48:48,182 --> 00:48:51,181
is "the big get."

905
00:48:51,182 --> 00:48:54,181
Winner of <i>last comic standing</i>
season three

906
00:48:54,182 --> 00:48:55,181
25 minutes before they did

907
00:48:55,182 --> 00:49:00,181
<i>last comic standing</i>
season four.

908
00:49:00,182 --> 00:49:03,182
Your head looks like one
of Shaq's balls.

909
00:49:09,182 --> 00:49:12,181
And Sarah silverman
was terrific.

910
00:49:12,182 --> 00:49:14,181
I know she's having a hard time,
but don't feel bad.

911
00:49:14,182 --> 00:49:16,181
Sarah's fucked
so many comedians,

912
00:49:16,182 --> 00:49:18,181
she has a little light
over her bed

913
00:49:18,182 --> 00:49:20,182
so they know when
they have two minutes left.

914
00:49:30,182 --> 00:49:34,181
And Brian posehn,
I'm so happy you're here.

915
00:49:34,182 --> 00:49:36,181
Your face always looks

916
00:49:36,182 --> 00:49:39,182
like you just saw
the ark of the covenant.

917
00:49:44,182 --> 00:49:47,181
Bob, how many people
turned down comedy central

918
00:49:47,182 --> 00:49:50,181
before they finally
settled on you?

919
00:49:50,182 --> 00:49:52,181
I mean, not to be a dick,
but like, you know,

920
00:49:52,182 --> 00:49:54,181
on the fucking
comic scale of importance,

921
00:49:54,182 --> 00:49:56,181
you're two notches below
Blair's cousin geri

922
00:49:56,182 --> 00:49:58,182
on <i>the facts of life.</i>

923
00:50:03,182 --> 00:50:07,181
Jeff garlin, how fat a man
do you intend on being?

924
00:50:07,182 --> 00:50:10,182
Fuck enthusiasm.
Curb your appetite.

925
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:21,181
Norm MacDonald, God bless you.

926
00:50:21,182 --> 00:50:23,181
Watching your set
was like watching Henry Fonda

927
00:50:23,182 --> 00:50:26,182
pick blueberries.

928
00:50:36,182 --> 00:50:38,181
- Is that--
now, wait a minute.

929
00:50:38,182 --> 00:50:41,181
- What's that?
Oh, he wants to say something.

930
00:50:41,182 --> 00:50:43,181
- No, I just think
it would be--

931
00:50:43,182 --> 00:50:46,181
why, I don't think
there's a person in here

932
00:50:46,182 --> 00:50:48,181
that would not love
to watch Henry Fonda

933
00:50:48,182 --> 00:50:50,181
pick blueberries.

934
00:50:50,182 --> 00:50:53,182
- [Laughs]

935
00:50:54,182 --> 00:50:56,182
You raise a good point, norm.

936
00:51:01,182 --> 00:51:03,181
Jon lovitz,
it's gotten to a point

937
00:51:03,182 --> 00:51:08,182
where I almost feel like success
has a restraining order on you.

938
00:51:11,182 --> 00:51:13,181
God bless cloris leachman.

939
00:51:13,182 --> 00:51:14,181
You were terrific tonight.

940
00:51:14,182 --> 00:51:15,181
[Cheers and applause]

941
00:51:15,182 --> 00:51:17,182
Terrific.

942
00:51:24,182 --> 00:51:27,182
She costarred
in <i>young Frankenstein.</i>

943
00:51:28,182 --> 00:51:31,181
Wonderful.

944
00:51:31,182 --> 00:51:32,181
Although back then,

945
00:51:32,182 --> 00:51:34,181
she worked
under a different name:

946
00:51:34,182 --> 00:51:36,182
Peter boyle.

947
00:51:43,182 --> 00:51:45,181
I don't mean
to be a little blue here,

948
00:51:45,182 --> 00:51:50,181
but cloris leachman's pussy
is so dry,

949
00:51:50,182 --> 00:51:54,182
that when I tickled the lips,
it coughed on me.

950
00:51:59,182 --> 00:52:00,181
Life sucks.

951
00:52:00,182 --> 00:52:02,181
Pryor's dead.
Carlin's dead.

952
00:52:02,182 --> 00:52:05,182
Saget?
Healthy as a mule.

953
00:52:12,182 --> 00:52:13,181
Bob, you're a great guy,

954
00:52:13,182 --> 00:52:15,181
and I'm honored
to have been here with you,

955
00:52:15,182 --> 00:52:17,181
and you're a friend,
and I thank you so much.

956
00:52:17,182 --> 00:52:19,181
And it really is it out of love
that we shit on each other.

957
00:52:19,182 --> 00:52:20,181
Thank you guys so much.

958
00:52:20,182 --> 00:52:22,181
The great Bob saget.

959
00:52:22,182 --> 00:52:25,182
[Cheers and applause]

960
00:52:37,316 --> 00:52:38,315
We all know that,

961
00:52:38,316 --> 00:52:40,315
but once in a while
you got to kiss up to him,

962
00:52:40,316 --> 00:52:42,315
because he plays
the guitar well.

963
00:52:42,316 --> 00:52:43,315
And in case you have
a bar mitzvah

964
00:52:43,316 --> 00:52:45,315
or a private party,
you need somebody in the garden

965
00:52:45,316 --> 00:52:47,315
to stroll along
with the dirty words

966
00:52:47,316 --> 00:52:48,315
and his little guitar pick.

967
00:52:48,316 --> 00:52:51,315
I'm not gonna lie to you, Bob.
You have no talent.

968
00:52:51,316 --> 00:52:53,067
Get a harmonica,
put it on your ass,

969
00:52:53,068 --> 00:52:54,315
and try to come up
with a tune.

970
00:52:54,316 --> 00:52:57,315
John stamos, I can't believe it.

971
00:52:57,316 --> 00:53:00,315
You are the mc
of a guy that's going nowhere.

972
00:53:00,316 --> 00:53:01,315
And John, I'm a friend.

973
00:53:01,316 --> 00:53:02,315
Your case comes up Friday.

974
00:53:02,316 --> 00:53:05,315
She was only 11,
11 years old.

975
00:53:05,316 --> 00:53:07,315
You kept pulling on the dress.
You don't need that, John.

976
00:53:07,316 --> 00:53:09,315
Get yourself a day job
in Greece.

977
00:53:09,316 --> 00:53:10,315
Live there.
Clean apples.

978
00:53:10,316 --> 00:53:11,315
Do something.

979
00:53:11,316 --> 00:53:13,315
Run around looking for zorba.

980
00:53:13,316 --> 00:53:15,315
Bob, do yourself a favor.

981
00:53:15,316 --> 00:53:16,315
Go to Israel,
and get picked off.

982
00:53:16,316 --> 00:53:18,315
Get the Hamas to knock you off.
It's all over.

983
00:53:18,316 --> 00:53:21,315
In the meantime,
I'm going back to my estate,

984
00:53:21,316 --> 00:53:22,315
and we need a guy
to clean the lawn.

985
00:53:22,316 --> 00:53:23,315
So I'll give you a buzz, okay?

986
00:53:23,316 --> 00:53:25,316
Take care of yourself.

987
00:53:31,316 --> 00:53:34,315
Our next roaster
never opens his eyes,

988
00:53:34,316 --> 00:53:37,315
because he can't bear
to watch the audience walk out.

989
00:53:37,316 --> 00:53:40,315
Here to scream obscenities
in a screeching voice

990
00:53:40,316 --> 00:53:41,315
that never gets old,

991
00:53:41,316 --> 00:53:43,315
Gilbert gottfried.

992
00:53:43,316 --> 00:53:46,316
[Cheers and applause]

993
00:53:55,316 --> 00:54:00,315
- Thank you, John.

994
00:54:00,316 --> 00:54:03,315
Boy, is he funny or what?

995
00:54:03,316 --> 00:54:07,315
How can you follow John stamos?

996
00:54:07,316 --> 00:54:10,315
And they say greeks
aren't funny.

997
00:54:10,316 --> 00:54:13,315
And they say greeks smell bad.

998
00:54:13,316 --> 00:54:17,315
And they say their women
are fat and hairy.

999
00:54:17,316 --> 00:54:21,316
But enough about John
and his sisters.

1000
00:54:23,316 --> 00:54:25,315
Now, a lot of you are saying,

1001
00:54:25,316 --> 00:54:28,315
"why did we pick Bob saget?

1002
00:54:28,316 --> 00:54:30,315
"Why should we pick Bob saget,

1003
00:54:30,316 --> 00:54:36,315
"who raped and killed a girl
in 1990?

1004
00:54:36,316 --> 00:54:41,315
"Should we even waste
two seconds on Bob saget,

1005
00:54:41,316 --> 00:54:45,315
who raped and killed a girl
in 1990?"

1006
00:54:45,316 --> 00:54:47,315
Well, first of all,
it's not true.

1007
00:54:47,316 --> 00:54:55,315
It's not true that Bob saget
raped and killed a girl in 1990.

1008
00:54:55,316 --> 00:54:59,315
So if you have any proof
that Bob saget

1009
00:54:59,316 --> 00:55:02,315
raped and killed a girl in 1990,

1010
00:55:02,316 --> 00:55:04,315
stop gossiping,

1011
00:55:04,316 --> 00:55:07,316
and go right
to the police with it.

1012
00:55:17,316 --> 00:55:19,315
Jim Norton is a pervert.

1013
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:21,315
He's a necrophiliac.

1014
00:55:21,316 --> 00:55:25,316
Last night, he fucked
norm MacDonald and his career.

1015
00:55:27,316 --> 00:55:29,316
- [Laughs]

1016
00:55:34,316 --> 00:55:37,315
- And cloris leachman.

1017
00:55:37,316 --> 00:55:42,315
Cloris leachman is so old
that her tits are labeled,

1018
00:55:42,316 --> 00:55:46,316
"whites only"
and "colored."

1019
00:55:55,316 --> 00:56:00,316
Her tits are a shameful time
in this country's history.

1020
00:56:03,316 --> 00:56:07,315
When I saw a great man
like nipsey Russell

1021
00:56:07,316 --> 00:56:10,315
pushed away
from one of her tits,

1022
00:56:10,316 --> 00:56:14,315
it was wrong.

1023
00:56:14,316 --> 00:56:20,315
Now, I watched Bob saget's
hbo special in high-def,

1024
00:56:20,316 --> 00:56:22,315
because in order to enjoy it,

1025
00:56:22,316 --> 00:56:25,316
you have to be
either high or deaf.

1026
00:56:35,316 --> 00:56:39,315
But his career's
totally insignificant.

1027
00:56:39,316 --> 00:56:40,315
I googled "Bob saget,"

1028
00:56:40,316 --> 00:56:44,316
and it came back, "why?"

1029
00:56:47,316 --> 00:56:50,315
Now I'd like to do
an old joke.

1030
00:56:50,316 --> 00:56:53,315
John stamos walks into a bar.

1031
00:56:53,316 --> 00:56:54,315
The bartender says,

1032
00:56:54,316 --> 00:56:56,315
"we have a drink
named after you."

1033
00:56:56,316 --> 00:56:58,315
John stamos says,

1034
00:56:58,316 --> 00:57:01,316
"you have a drink
named secret fag?"

1035
00:57:08,316 --> 00:57:14,315
Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen
walk into a bar.

1036
00:57:14,316 --> 00:57:18,315
They say to the bartender,
"give us two ass hurts."

1037
00:57:18,316 --> 00:57:20,315
The bartender says,

1038
00:57:20,316 --> 00:57:23,315
"how do you make an ass hurt?"

1039
00:57:23,316 --> 00:57:26,315
The Olsen twins say,
"well, Bob saget

1040
00:57:26,316 --> 00:57:29,315
"hands you a chocolate milk
that he just made,

1041
00:57:29,316 --> 00:57:33,315
"and you wake up
three hours later

1042
00:57:33,316 --> 00:57:35,316
lying on your stomach."

1043
00:57:50,316 --> 00:57:53,315
And lastly,

1044
00:57:53,316 --> 00:57:56,315
Bob saget walks into a bar,

1045
00:57:56,316 --> 00:57:59,315
and he says to the bartender,

1046
00:57:59,316 --> 00:58:01,315
"give me the Bob saget."

1047
00:58:01,316 --> 00:58:04,315
The bartender says,
"what's a Bob saget?"

1048
00:58:04,316 --> 00:58:07,315
And he says,
"you give me one shot,

1049
00:58:07,316 --> 00:58:09,315
"I suck it for eight years,

1050
00:58:09,316 --> 00:58:12,316
then you give me
$100 million."

1051
00:58:18,316 --> 00:58:20,315
God bless you all.

1052
00:58:20,316 --> 00:58:23,315
Don't use drugs.

1053
00:58:23,316 --> 00:58:26,316
[Cheers and applause]

1054
00:58:45,054 --> 00:58:48,053
- Well, it's been
a great night of comedy.

1055
00:58:48,054 --> 00:58:50,053
But all good things
must come to an end,

1056
00:58:50,054 --> 00:58:54,053
which means it's time
for our guest of honor.

1057
00:58:54,054 --> 00:58:56,053
I can't believe that
after spending so many years

1058
00:58:56,054 --> 00:58:59,053
begging him to shut up,
I'm now gonna ask him to speak.

1059
00:58:59,054 --> 00:59:00,053
It takes a big man

1060
00:59:00,054 --> 00:59:02,053
to sit up here
and take all this.

1061
00:59:02,054 --> 00:59:03,053
And I'll tell you two guys

1062
00:59:03,054 --> 00:59:05,053
that are laughing
the hardest tonight:

1063
00:59:05,054 --> 00:59:06,054
Our fathers.

1064
00:59:09,054 --> 00:59:13,053
Please welcome
the great Bob saget.

1065
00:59:13,054 --> 00:59:16,054
[Cheers and applause]

1066
00:59:37,054 --> 00:59:38,053
- Thank you.

1067
00:59:38,054 --> 00:59:40,053
Thank you very much.

1068
00:59:40,054 --> 00:59:42,053
What a night.

1069
00:59:42,054 --> 00:59:43,053
Thank you, John.

1070
00:59:43,054 --> 00:59:45,053
This is the longest
John stamos has gone

1071
00:59:45,054 --> 00:59:48,054
without putting his cock
in a desperate actress.

1072
00:59:51,054 --> 00:59:52,053
Yeah.

1073
00:59:52,054 --> 00:59:54,053
You know, they say
the measure of a man

1074
00:59:54,054 --> 00:59:56,053
is judged
by the company he keeps.

1075
00:59:56,054 --> 01:00:00,053
I'm fucked.

1076
01:00:00,054 --> 01:00:02,053
Greg giraldo,
you should be a bigger star.

1077
01:00:02,054 --> 01:00:03,053
You should be much bigger.

1078
01:00:03,054 --> 01:00:06,053
You have more talent
in your little finger--

1079
01:00:06,054 --> 01:00:09,053
oh, sorry.
That's your dick.

1080
01:00:09,054 --> 01:00:13,053
Jeff garlin
is a very funny fuck.

1081
01:00:13,054 --> 01:00:14,053
I'm sorry.
Last minute changes.

1082
01:00:14,054 --> 01:00:15,053
I apologize.

1083
01:00:15,054 --> 01:00:20,053
Jeff garlin is a very fat fuck.

1084
01:00:20,054 --> 01:00:22,053
Jeff's so fat...

1085
01:00:22,054 --> 01:00:23,053
[Chuckles]

1086
01:00:23,054 --> 01:00:28,053
His last comedy special
was shot in imax.

1087
01:00:28,054 --> 01:00:30,053
Norm MacDonald, norm,

1088
01:00:30,054 --> 01:00:33,053
you're the funniest man I know,

1089
01:00:33,054 --> 01:00:36,054
because these are
the other people that I know.

1090
01:00:40,054 --> 01:00:43,053
Norm is such a horrible gambler,

1091
01:00:43,054 --> 01:00:46,054
he bet that jon lovitz
would be funny tonight.

1092
01:00:48,054 --> 01:00:50,053
Okay, now I'd like
to say a few words

1093
01:00:50,054 --> 01:00:52,053
about susie's vagina.

1094
01:00:52,054 --> 01:00:54,053
I don't want to say
that her vagina is foul,

1095
01:00:54,054 --> 01:00:57,053
but it has a beak and feathers.

1096
01:00:57,054 --> 01:01:00,053
In fact, her vagina
got a job last year

1097
01:01:00,054 --> 01:01:05,053
as the monster in <i>cloverfield.</i>

1098
01:01:05,054 --> 01:01:07,053
Jeff Ross,
Jeff, we're buddies...

1099
01:01:07,054 --> 01:01:09,053
- Yeah!

1100
01:01:09,054 --> 01:01:10,053
- But I've always wanted
to tell you this.

1101
01:01:10,054 --> 01:01:12,053
You look like they took
the friars club

1102
01:01:12,054 --> 01:01:14,053
and beat you
in the face with it.

1103
01:01:14,054 --> 01:01:15,053
If you looked
any more like a horse,

1104
01:01:15,054 --> 01:01:19,053
norm MacDonald
would lose ten grand on you.

1105
01:01:19,054 --> 01:01:22,053
[Sighs]

1106
01:01:22,054 --> 01:01:25,053
Brian posehn.
Am I saying it right?

1107
01:01:25,054 --> 01:01:28,053
Is it bri-an?

1108
01:01:28,054 --> 01:01:30,053
Look at that face.

1109
01:01:30,054 --> 01:01:32,054
Did any other lesbians
survive the fire?

1110
01:01:37,054 --> 01:01:39,053
Which brings us to jon lovitz.

1111
01:01:39,054 --> 01:01:42,053
Jon, your act
is like masturbation.

1112
01:01:42,054 --> 01:01:43,053
You're the only one
who enjoys it,

1113
01:01:43,054 --> 01:01:48,053
and you should be arrested
for doing it in public.

1114
01:01:48,054 --> 01:01:49,053
But I love you, John

1115
01:01:49,054 --> 01:01:52,053
stamos.

1116
01:01:52,054 --> 01:01:56,053
Cloris leachman, it's truly
an honor to have you here.

1117
01:01:56,054 --> 01:01:59,054
[Cheers and applause]

1118
01:02:00,054 --> 01:02:03,053
Cloris was very hard
to get for this roast,

1119
01:02:03,054 --> 01:02:07,053
because she communicates
by telegraph.

1120
01:02:07,054 --> 01:02:08,053
Gilbert gottfried.

1121
01:02:08,054 --> 01:02:12,053
Gilbert.
Gilbert.

1122
01:02:12,054 --> 01:02:14,053
Why are you always squinting?

1123
01:02:14,054 --> 01:02:18,054
Seriously, it's like
you're staring at an eclipse.

1124
01:02:23,054 --> 01:02:27,053
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's your career.

1125
01:02:27,054 --> 01:02:28,053
Look at you.

1126
01:02:28,054 --> 01:02:31,053
That's the face
of a pedophile.

1127
01:02:31,054 --> 01:02:33,053
What better way
to lure a kid into a van

1128
01:02:33,054 --> 01:02:35,054
than to use the parrot voice
from <i>Aladdin?</i>

1129
01:02:45,054 --> 01:02:47,053
Jim Norton,

1130
01:02:47,054 --> 01:02:49,053
you look like something
that just got burned

1131
01:02:49,054 --> 01:02:53,053
off stamos's cock.

1132
01:02:53,054 --> 01:02:54,053
You are the most
repugnant creature

1133
01:02:54,054 --> 01:02:56,053
I have ever seen.

1134
01:02:56,054 --> 01:03:00,054
You look like a mongoloid
fucked an iguana.

1135
01:03:03,054 --> 01:03:06,053
And then there's my good friend
John stamos.

1136
01:03:06,054 --> 01:03:09,054
[Cheers and applause]

1137
01:03:10,054 --> 01:03:11,053
He's so handsome.

1138
01:03:11,054 --> 01:03:14,053
Even his dick
has a great hairline.

1139
01:03:14,054 --> 01:03:19,053
During <i>full house,</i>
John's dick had a mullet.

1140
01:03:19,054 --> 01:03:20,053
In the '80s,
there were two things

1141
01:03:20,054 --> 01:03:22,053
every actress wanted to be on:

1142
01:03:22,054 --> 01:03:26,053
<i>The love boat</i>
and John stamos's cock.

1143
01:03:26,054 --> 01:03:28,053
Neither help your career,
but at least <i>the love boat</i>

1144
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:31,053
didn't try
to fuck you in the ass.

1145
01:03:31,054 --> 01:03:33,054
That would have been
exciting and new.

1146
01:03:36,054 --> 01:03:40,053
I love you, Jesse.

1147
01:03:40,054 --> 01:03:42,053
This, honestly,
has been quite a night.

1148
01:03:42,054 --> 01:03:44,053
I was concerned,
because it's hard

1149
01:03:44,054 --> 01:03:46,053
to make fun of my friends
and the people I love,

1150
01:03:46,054 --> 01:03:50,053
but luckily,
none of them are here.

1151
01:03:50,054 --> 01:03:52,053
And it's really--truly,
it's really great to be honored

1152
01:03:52,054 --> 01:03:53,053
and to be part
of a hit show,

1153
01:03:53,054 --> 01:03:55,053
and I know this
is gonna be a hit show,

1154
01:03:55,054 --> 01:03:56,053
because I'm on it,

1155
01:03:56,054 --> 01:03:58,053
and we're gonna edit out
jon lovitz.

1156
01:03:58,054 --> 01:04:00,053
'Cause that's what I do.

1157
01:04:00,054 --> 01:04:02,053
I star in monster TV shows,
and I cut out the lame parts,

1158
01:04:02,054 --> 01:04:06,053
you talentless,
white motherfuckers.

1159
01:04:06,054 --> 01:04:09,053
So in summation,
and I mean this to all of you

1160
01:04:09,054 --> 01:04:11,053
from the bottom of my heart,

1161
01:04:11,054 --> 01:04:14,053
fuck you all,
and suck my $100 million cock.

1162
01:04:14,054 --> 01:04:15,053
[Cheers and applause]

1163
01:04:15,054 --> 01:04:18,054
Good night, and thank you.
