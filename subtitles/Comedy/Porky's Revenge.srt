1
00:03:07,112 --> 00:03:08,246
Lock onto him, R2.

2
00:03:08,548 --> 00:03:11,984
Master, General Grievous's ship is directly ahead-

3
00:03:12,085 --> 00:03:14,315
the one crawling
with vulture droids.

4
00:03:14,421 --> 00:03:16,946
Oh, I see it.
Oh, this is going to be easy.

5
00:03:24,598 --> 00:03:27,158
- Oddball, do you copy?
- Copy, Red Leader.

6
00:03:27,267 --> 00:03:29,565
Mark my position.
Form your squad up behind me.

7
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,570
We're on your tail,
General Kenobi.

8
00:03:31,672 --> 00:03:33,572
Set S-foils in attack position.

9
00:03:47,521 --> 00:03:49,512
This is where the fun begins.

10
00:03:49,623 --> 00:03:51,648
Let them pass between us.

11
00:04:08,408 --> 00:04:12,344
They're all over me. Get them off my-

12
00:04:12,446 --> 00:04:14,346
- I'm gonna go help them out.
- No.

13
00:04:14,448 --> 00:04:17,144
No, they are doing their job
so we can do ours.

14
00:04:31,131 --> 00:04:33,691
Missiles. Pull up.

15
00:04:35,135 --> 00:04:37,660
- They overshot us.
- They're coming around.

16
00:04:42,042 --> 00:04:44,875
All right, R4.

17
00:04:44,978 --> 00:04:47,503
No, no, no, no-
No, nothing too fancy.

18
00:04:50,784 --> 00:04:54,515
Surge all power units, R2.
Stand by reverse thrusters.

19
00:05:02,329 --> 00:05:05,856
We got 'em, R2.

20
00:05:14,207 --> 00:05:16,232
Flying is for droids.

21
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:27,250
- I'm hit. Anakin?
- I see them. Buzz droids.

22
00:05:34,861 --> 00:05:36,852
R4, be careful.
You have a-

23
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:41,896
Oh, dear.

24
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,901
They're shutting down
all the controls.

25
00:05:46,006 --> 00:05:49,032
- Move to the right so I can
get a clear shot at them.
- The mission.

26
00:05:49,142 --> 00:05:52,976
Get to the command ship. Get the chancellor.
I'm running out of tricks here.

27
00:05:55,882 --> 00:06:00,148
Oh! In the name of-

28
00:06:02,489 --> 00:06:06,425
- Hold your fire! You're not helping here.
- I agree. Bad idea.

29
00:06:12,866 --> 00:06:15,596
I can't see a thing.
My cockpit's fogging.

30
00:06:18,905 --> 00:06:20,770
They're all over me.
Anakin!

31
00:06:23,844 --> 00:06:27,507
- Move to the right.
- Hold on, Anakin. You're gonna get us both killed.

32
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:31,984
Get out of here.
There's nothing more you can do.

33
00:06:32,085 --> 00:06:34,246
I'm not leaving
without you, Master.

34
00:06:43,263 --> 00:06:46,096
Get him, R2.

35
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:49,532
Watch out.

36
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,472
R2, hit the buzz droid's
center eye.

37
00:07:03,717 --> 00:07:06,015
- Yeah, you got him!
- Great, R2.

38
00:07:08,321 --> 00:07:10,221
The general's command ship
is dead ahead.

39
00:07:12,325 --> 00:07:14,384
Well, have you noticed
the shields are still up?

40
00:07:14,494 --> 00:07:16,485
Sorry, Master.

41
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,129
Oh, I have a bad feeling
about this.

42
00:07:40,987 --> 00:07:43,114
There they are.
Get them.

43
00:07:52,532 --> 00:07:56,662
R2, locate the chancellor.

44
00:08:05,045 --> 00:08:07,741
The chancellor's signal is coming from right there-

45
00:08:07,847 --> 00:08:10,907
the observation platform
at the top of that spire.

46
00:08:11,017 --> 00:08:12,951
I sense Count Dooku.

47
00:08:13,053 --> 00:08:16,318
- I sense a trap.
- Next move?

48
00:08:16,423 --> 00:08:20,018
Spring the trap.

49
00:08:20,126 --> 00:08:23,289
R2, go back.
I need you to stay with the ship.

50
00:08:23,396 --> 00:08:25,296
Here. Take this
and wait for orders.

51
00:08:39,646 --> 00:08:43,104
What's the situation, Captain?

52
00:08:43,216 --> 00:08:47,152
Two Jedi have landed in the main hangar bay.
We're tracking them.

53
00:08:47,253 --> 00:08:51,553
Just as Count Dooku predicted.

54
00:08:54,995 --> 00:08:56,758
Destroyers.

55
00:09:05,005 --> 00:09:07,838
Drop your weapons.
I said drop 'em.

56
00:09:07,941 --> 00:09:09,431
- Roger.
- Roger, roger.

57
00:09:09,542 --> 00:09:10,736
Roger, roger.

58
00:09:18,385 --> 00:09:20,285
Those are Jedi fighters
all right.

59
00:09:24,924 --> 00:09:26,915
- Did you press the stop button?
- No. Did you?

60
00:09:27,027 --> 00:09:30,292
- No.
- Well, there's more than one way out of here.

61
00:09:30,397 --> 00:09:32,194
We don't want to get out.

62
00:09:32,298 --> 00:09:37,998
We want to get moving.
R2, activate elevator 31174.

63
00:09:38,104 --> 00:09:40,299
- Come in, R2.
- What that?

64
00:09:40,407 --> 00:09:42,307
R2, do you copy?

65
00:09:42,409 --> 00:09:44,309
R2, activate
the elevator number...

66
00:09:44,411 --> 00:09:46,641
31174.

67
00:09:46,746 --> 00:09:49,681
Get back to work.
That nothin'.

68
00:09:49,783 --> 00:09:52,718
Activate the elevator 31174.

69
00:09:52,819 --> 00:09:54,719
R2, we-

70
00:09:59,893 --> 00:10:02,453
Always on the move.

71
00:10:02,562 --> 00:10:04,462
R2, switch on the comlink.

72
00:10:04,564 --> 00:10:06,555
R2, can you hear me?

73
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:09,134
R2?

74
00:10:09,235 --> 00:10:10,497
Whoa!

75
00:10:10,603 --> 00:10:12,696
R2! R2!

76
00:10:16,176 --> 00:10:19,509
Stop. Stop.
R2, we need to be going up.

77
00:10:21,981 --> 00:10:23,881
Hands up, Jedi.

78
00:10:23,983 --> 00:10:26,178
R2, do you copy?

79
00:10:26,286 --> 00:10:30,245
R2, do you hear me?
R2, we need to be going up, not down.

80
00:10:35,128 --> 00:10:38,097
Hey, you!

81
00:10:41,301 --> 00:10:43,201
Now, that's better.

82
00:10:43,303 --> 00:10:47,569
You stupid little astro droid.

83
00:10:48,508 --> 00:10:50,772
Uh-oh.

84
00:10:57,784 --> 00:10:59,684
Oh, it's you.

85
00:11:01,821 --> 00:11:03,618
My eyes! My eyes!

86
00:11:03,723 --> 00:11:06,191
- What was that all about?
- Well, R2 has been-

87
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:09,227
- Uh, no loose wire jokes.
- Did I say anything?

88
00:11:09,329 --> 00:11:11,263
- He's trying.
- I didn't say anything.

89
00:11:48,902 --> 00:11:50,802
- Chancellor.
- Are you all right?

90
00:11:50,904 --> 00:11:53,498
Count Dooku.

91
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:00,978
- This time we will do it together.
- I was about to say that.

92
00:12:09,923 --> 00:12:13,120
Get help. You're no match for him.
He's a Sith lord.

93
00:12:13,226 --> 00:12:17,287
Chancellor Palpatine,
Sith lords are our speciality.

94
00:12:17,397 --> 00:12:20,298
Your swords, please.

95
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,858
We don't want to make a mess of things
in front of the chancellor.

96
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:26,200
You won't get away
this time, Dooku.

97
00:12:37,217 --> 00:12:39,151
I've been looking forward
to this.

98
00:12:39,252 --> 00:12:42,449
My powers have doubled since
the last time we met, Count.

99
00:12:42,555 --> 00:12:46,013
Good. Twice the pride,
double the fall.

100
00:13:06,112 --> 00:13:07,079
Get-

101
00:13:32,338 --> 00:13:37,401
I sense great fear
in you, Skywalker.

102
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:41,173
You have hate.
You have anger.

103
00:13:41,281 --> 00:13:43,181
But you don't use them.

104
00:14:02,835 --> 00:14:06,601
Good, Anakin. Good.

105
00:14:06,706 --> 00:14:08,697
Kill him.

106
00:14:10,209 --> 00:14:11,767
Kill him now.

107
00:14:17,417 --> 00:14:19,317
I shouldn't.

108
00:14:22,188 --> 00:14:24,349
Do it.

109
00:14:35,335 --> 00:14:38,236
You did well, Anakin.

110
00:14:38,338 --> 00:14:42,274
He was too dangerous
to be kept alive.

111
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:44,775
Yes, but he was
an unarmed prisoner.

112
00:14:44,877 --> 00:14:47,744
I shouldn't have done that.
It's not the Jedi way.

113
00:14:47,847 --> 00:14:52,978
It is only natural. He cut off your arm,
and you wanted revenge.

114
00:14:53,086 --> 00:14:56,112
It wasn't
the first time, Anakin.

115
00:14:56,222 --> 00:14:59,988
Remember what you told me
about your mother and the Sand People?

116
00:15:02,762 --> 00:15:06,357
Now we must leave before
more security droids arrive.

117
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:13,762
Anakin,
there's no time.

118
00:15:13,873 --> 00:15:17,104
We must get off this ship
before it's too late.

119
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:21,203
- He seems to be all right.
- Leave him, or we'll never make it.

120
00:15:21,314 --> 00:15:24,010
His fate will be
the same as ours.

121
00:15:28,454 --> 00:15:30,615
Prepare for attack!

122
00:15:31,991 --> 00:15:34,824
All batteries, fire!
Fire!

123
00:15:44,904 --> 00:15:46,804
Elevator's not working.

124
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:53,204
R2, activate elevator 3224.

125
00:16:11,931 --> 00:16:15,162
- Reverse stabilizers.
- Reversing stabilizers.

126
00:16:34,454 --> 00:16:36,547
Magnetize!
Magnetize!

127
00:16:43,162 --> 00:16:46,461
Fire the emergency
booster engines.

128
00:16:51,504 --> 00:16:53,369
We're leveling out, sir.

129
00:16:56,542 --> 00:16:58,976
Oh!

130
00:17:09,155 --> 00:17:11,316
Easy. We're in a bit of a situation here.

131
00:17:11,424 --> 00:17:14,052
- Did I miss something?
- Hold on.

132
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,321
- What is that?
- Uh, oops.

133
00:17:16,429 --> 00:17:18,420
R2. R2, shut down
the elevator.

134
00:17:18,531 --> 00:17:20,465
Too late. Jump!

135
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,743
Let's see if we can find something
in the hangar bay that's still flyable.

136
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,909
R2, get down here.

137
00:17:40,019 --> 00:17:42,283
R2, do you copy?

138
00:17:46,225 --> 00:17:48,955
General, we found the Jedi.

139
00:17:49,061 --> 00:17:53,464
- They're in hallway 328.
- Activate ray shields.

140
00:17:55,868 --> 00:17:57,768
Ray shields.

141
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,770
Wait a minute.
How did this happen?

142
00:17:59,872 --> 00:18:02,204
- We're smarter than this.
- Apparently not.

143
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:07,373
- I say patience.
- Patience?

144
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,779
Yes. R2 will be along
in a few moments...

145
00:18:10,883 --> 00:18:14,148
and then... he'll release
the ray shields.

146
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,990
See? No problem.

147
00:18:25,331 --> 00:18:27,231
Don't move.

148
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,164
Ow!

149
00:18:30,303 --> 00:18:33,170
Do you have a plan "B"?

150
00:18:38,844 --> 00:18:43,406
Ah, yes.
The negotiator.

151
00:18:43,516 --> 00:18:47,748
General Kenobi.
We've been waiting for you.

152
00:18:47,853 --> 00:18:50,014
Excuse me.

153
00:18:50,122 --> 00:18:52,886
- That wasn't much of a rescue.
- You're welcome.

154
00:18:52,992 --> 00:18:55,426
And-

155
00:18:55,528 --> 00:18:58,326
Anakin Skywalker.

156
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:04,131
I was expecting someone with
your reputation to be a little... older.

157
00:19:06,272 --> 00:19:10,538
General Grievous.
You're shorter than I expected.

158
00:19:10,643 --> 00:19:15,171
Jedi scum.

159
00:19:15,281 --> 00:19:18,045
We have a job to do, Anakin.
Try not to upset him.

160
00:19:22,855 --> 00:19:27,519
Your lightsabers will make
a fine addition to my collection.

161
00:19:27,627 --> 00:19:31,290
Not this time.
And this time, you won't escape.

162
00:19:31,397 --> 00:19:33,627
R2.

163
00:19:37,403 --> 00:19:40,099
Crush them!

164
00:19:40,206 --> 00:19:42,265
Make them suffer!

165
00:19:46,312 --> 00:19:47,973
Come. Now!

166
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,241
- Stay at your stations!
- Whoa!

167
00:19:56,922 --> 00:19:59,413
Get him! Get him!

168
00:20:01,861 --> 00:20:03,761
Ow!

169
00:20:17,777 --> 00:20:19,677
Run!

170
00:20:23,249 --> 00:20:26,776
- Don't bother with them. Keep the ship in orbit.
- Yes, sir.

171
00:20:37,797 --> 00:20:40,459
You lose, General Kenobi.

172
00:21:04,323 --> 00:21:06,382
Get out of here! Run!

173
00:21:19,538 --> 00:21:22,029
Time to abandon ship.

174
00:21:29,281 --> 00:21:31,681
All the escape pods have been launched.

175
00:21:31,784 --> 00:21:34,844
Grievous. Can you fly a cruiser like this?

176
00:21:34,954 --> 00:21:37,946
- You mean, do I know how to land
what's left of this thing?
- Well?

177
00:21:38,057 --> 00:21:41,652
Well, under the circumstances,
I'd say the ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant.

178
00:21:41,761 --> 00:21:44,594
Strap yourselves in.

179
00:21:44,697 --> 00:21:47,564
Open all hatches.
Extend all flaps and drag fins.

180
00:22:02,181 --> 00:22:06,447
We lost something.

181
00:22:06,552 --> 00:22:09,020
Not to worry. We are still
flying half a ship.

182
00:22:12,324 --> 00:22:16,283
Now we're really picking up speed.

183
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:26,733
Eight plus 60.

184
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:30,866
- We're in the atmosphere.
- Grab that. Keep us level.

185
00:22:44,056 --> 00:22:47,150
Steady.

186
00:22:47,259 --> 00:22:49,887
Easy, R2.

187
00:22:53,098 --> 00:22:56,795
5000. Fire ships on
the left and the right.

188
00:22:56,902 --> 00:22:59,598
- We'll take you in.
- Copy that.

189
00:23:02,041 --> 00:23:05,807
- Landing strip, straight ahead.
- We're coming in too hot.

190
00:23:36,609 --> 00:23:38,873
Another happy landing.

191
00:24:09,108 --> 00:24:13,067
- Are you coming, Master?
- Oh, no. I'm not brave enough for politics.

192
00:24:13,178 --> 00:24:15,078
I have to report
to the council.

193
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:17,648
Besides, someone needs
to be the poster boy.

194
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:21,584
Hold on.
This whole operation was your idea.

195
00:24:21,687 --> 00:24:24,781
Let us not forget, Anakin,
that you rescued me from the buzz droids.

196
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:27,358
And you killed Count Dooku,
and you rescued the chancellor...

197
00:24:27,459 --> 00:24:29,359
carrying me unconscious
on your back.

198
00:24:29,461 --> 00:24:31,986
All because of
your training.

199
00:24:32,097 --> 00:24:35,589
Anakin, let's be fair.
Today you were the hero...

200
00:24:35,701 --> 00:24:38,761
and you deserve your glorious day
with the politicians.

201
00:24:38,871 --> 00:24:42,932
All right. But you owe me one, and not for
saving your skin for the 10th time.

202
00:24:43,042 --> 00:24:47,274
Ninth time. That business
on Cato Neimoidia doesn't- doesn't count.

203
00:24:47,379 --> 00:24:49,279
I'll see you
at the briefing.

204
00:24:54,653 --> 00:24:57,178
Chancellor Palpatine,
are you all right?

205
00:24:57,289 --> 00:25:00,190
Yes. Thanks to your
two Jedi knights.

206
00:25:00,292 --> 00:25:04,956
They killed Count Dooku,
but General Grievous has escaped once again.

207
00:25:05,064 --> 00:25:08,591
General Grievous will run and hide,
as he always does. He's a coward.

208
00:25:08,701 --> 00:25:13,001
But with Count Dooku dead,
he is the leader of the droid army.

209
00:25:13,105 --> 00:25:18,873
And I assure you, the senate will vote
to continue the war as long as Grievous is alive.

210
00:25:18,978 --> 00:25:23,005
Then the Jedi Council will make
finding Grievous our highest priority.

211
00:25:24,483 --> 00:25:26,417
- Watch it.
- Excuse me.

212
00:25:26,518 --> 00:25:29,487
- Come along, R2.
- The Republic cannot praise you enough.

213
00:25:29,588 --> 00:25:31,715
Thank you, Senator Organa.

214
00:25:31,824 --> 00:25:35,385
Well, it couldn't possibly be as bad as all that.

215
00:25:35,494 --> 00:25:37,428
Now there I agree with you.

216
00:25:37,529 --> 00:25:40,896
In fact, I could do with a tune-up myself.

217
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,131
But the fighting will continue
until General Grievous is spare parts.

218
00:25:46,238 --> 00:25:48,729
Well, I will do everything I can in the senate.

219
00:25:48,841 --> 00:25:51,105
- Excuse me.
- Certainly.

220
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,620
Oh, Anakin.

221
00:26:04,923 --> 00:26:08,381
I've missed you, Padmé.

222
00:26:09,595 --> 00:26:12,826
There were whispers
that you'd been killed.

223
00:26:12,931 --> 00:26:15,491
I'm all right.

224
00:26:15,601 --> 00:26:18,593
It feels like we've been
apart for a lifetime.

225
00:26:18,704 --> 00:26:21,502
And it might have been,
if the chancellor hadn't been kidnapped.

226
00:26:21,607 --> 00:26:24,872
I don't think they would have ever
brought us back from the outer rim sieges.

227
00:26:24,977 --> 00:26:27,707
- Wait. Not here.
- Yes, here.

228
00:26:27,813 --> 00:26:31,305
I'm- I'm tired of all this deception.
I don't care if they know we're married.

229
00:26:31,417 --> 00:26:33,681
Anakin, don't say
things like that.

230
00:26:42,494 --> 00:26:46,123
Are you all right?
You're trembling.

231
00:26:46,231 --> 00:26:48,324
What's going on?

232
00:26:50,436 --> 00:26:53,371
Something wonderful
has happened.

233
00:26:53,472 --> 00:26:57,841
Ani, I'm pregnant.

234
00:27:01,847 --> 00:27:03,747
That's-

235
00:27:08,921 --> 00:27:11,446
Well, that's won-
That's wonderful.

236
00:27:13,192 --> 00:27:16,184
What are we gonna do?

237
00:27:17,696 --> 00:27:21,097
We're not gonna worry
about anything right now. All right?

238
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,668
This is a happy moment.

239
00:27:25,671 --> 00:27:27,969
The happiest moment
of my life.

240
00:28:33,806 --> 00:28:36,969
Yes, Lord Sidious?

241
00:28:37,075 --> 00:28:38,975
General Grievous...

242
00:28:39,077 --> 00:28:44,174
I suggest you move
the separatist leaders to Mustafar.

243
00:28:44,283 --> 00:28:48,151
It will be done,
my lord.

244
00:28:48,253 --> 00:28:52,519
The end of the war
is near, General.

245
00:28:52,624 --> 00:28:56,253
But the loss
of Count Dooku-

246
00:28:56,361 --> 00:29:00,661
His death was
a necessary loss.

247
00:29:00,766 --> 00:29:04,896
Soon I will have
a new apprentice-

248
00:29:05,003 --> 00:29:10,270
one far younger
and more powerful.

249
00:29:37,302 --> 00:29:40,328
Ani, I want to have our baby
back home on Naboo.

250
00:29:40,439 --> 00:29:43,772
We can go to the lake country
where no one will know...

251
00:29:43,876 --> 00:29:45,776
where we can be safe.

252
00:29:47,012 --> 00:29:50,311
I can go early
and fix up the baby's room.

253
00:29:52,351 --> 00:29:57,618
I know the perfect spot.
Right by the gardens.

254
00:30:01,894 --> 00:30:05,193
You are so... beautiful.

255
00:30:06,832 --> 00:30:08,857
It's only because
I'm so in love.

256
00:30:08,967 --> 00:30:11,401
No.

257
00:30:11,503 --> 00:30:14,700
No, it's because
I'm so in love with you.

258
00:30:14,806 --> 00:30:18,333
So love has blinded you?

259
00:30:20,145 --> 00:30:22,170
Well, that's not
exactly what I meant.

260
00:30:23,782 --> 00:30:25,807
But it's probably true.

261
00:30:33,392 --> 00:30:36,953
Anakin, help me!

262
00:31:40,192 --> 00:31:42,092
What's bothering you?

263
00:31:44,529 --> 00:31:46,520
Nothing.

264
00:31:48,433 --> 00:31:50,799
I remember when
I gave this to you.

265
00:31:50,902 --> 00:31:55,100
How long is it gonna take
for us to be honest with each other?

266
00:31:57,709 --> 00:31:59,609
It was a dream.

267
00:31:59,711 --> 00:32:01,838
Bad?

268
00:32:01,947 --> 00:32:04,381
Like the ones I used to have
about my mother...

269
00:32:04,483 --> 00:32:06,383
just before she died.

270
00:32:06,485 --> 00:32:08,385
And?

271
00:32:11,256 --> 00:32:13,190
And it was about you.

272
00:32:15,761 --> 00:32:17,661
Tell me.

273
00:32:19,431 --> 00:32:21,365
It was only a dream.

274
00:32:34,312 --> 00:32:36,246
You die in childbirth.

275
00:32:36,348 --> 00:32:39,146
And the baby?

276
00:32:39,251 --> 00:32:41,583
I don't know.

277
00:32:43,088 --> 00:32:44,988
It was only a dream.

278
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:47,888
I won't let this one
become real.

279
00:32:48,994 --> 00:32:51,622
This baby will change
our lives.

280
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:54,665
I doubt the queen will continue
to allow me to serve in the senate.

281
00:32:54,766 --> 00:32:57,496
And if the council discovers
you're the father, you'll be expelled-

282
00:32:57,602 --> 00:33:00,093
I-I know. I know.

283
00:33:00,205 --> 00:33:03,868
Do you think Obi-Wan
might be able to help us?

284
00:33:05,911 --> 00:33:07,936
We don't need his help.

285
00:33:09,281 --> 00:33:12,273
Our baby is a blessing.

286
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:32,630
Premonitions?
Premonitions. Hmm.

287
00:33:32,737 --> 00:33:35,900
These visions you have-

288
00:33:36,007 --> 00:33:39,602
They're of pain,
suffering.

289
00:33:41,546 --> 00:33:43,446
Death.

290
00:33:43,548 --> 00:33:47,917
Yourself you speak of,
or someone you know?

291
00:33:49,421 --> 00:33:51,446
Someone.

292
00:33:51,556 --> 00:33:53,456
Close to you?

293
00:33:54,659 --> 00:33:56,854
Yes.

294
00:33:56,962 --> 00:34:00,830
Careful you must be when
sensing the future, Anakin.

295
00:34:00,932 --> 00:34:05,232
The fear of loss is a path
to the dark side.

296
00:34:07,506 --> 00:34:10,771
I won't let these visions
come true, Master Yoda.

297
00:34:10,876 --> 00:34:14,073
Death is
a natural part of life.

298
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:18,843
Rejoice for those around you
who transform into the Force.

299
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:22,249
Mourn them, do not.
Miss them, do not.

300
00:34:22,354 --> 00:34:25,448
Attachment leads
to jealousy.

301
00:34:25,557 --> 00:34:28,993
The shadow of greed that is.

302
00:34:29,094 --> 00:34:31,927
What must I do, Master Yoda?

303
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:35,056
Train yourself
to let go...

304
00:34:35,167 --> 00:34:38,603
of everything
you fear to lose.

305
00:34:49,014 --> 00:34:51,744
You've missed the report on the outer rim sieges.

306
00:34:53,185 --> 00:34:55,585
I'm sorry. I was held up.

307
00:34:55,687 --> 00:34:59,282
- I have no excuse.
- In short, they are going very well.

308
00:34:59,391 --> 00:35:04,795
Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos
has moved his troops to Boz Pity.

309
00:35:04,896 --> 00:35:06,887
What's wrong, then?

310
00:35:06,998 --> 00:35:09,592
The senate is expected...

311
00:35:09,701 --> 00:35:13,193
to vote more executive powers
to the chancellor today.

312
00:35:13,305 --> 00:35:17,674
Well, that can only mean less deliberating
and more action. Is that bad?

313
00:35:17,776 --> 00:35:20,176
It'll make it easier
for us to end this war.

314
00:35:21,947 --> 00:35:24,245
Be careful of
your friend Palpatine.

315
00:35:25,917 --> 00:35:27,817
Be careful of what?

316
00:35:27,919 --> 00:35:30,547
- He has requested your presence.
- What for?

317
00:35:30,655 --> 00:35:35,285
- He would not say.
- He didn't inform the council?

318
00:35:35,393 --> 00:35:38,851
- That's unusual, isn't it?
- All of this is unusual.

319
00:35:38,964 --> 00:35:41,398
And it's making me feel uneasy.

320
00:35:56,381 --> 00:35:58,281
I hope you trust me, Anakin.

321
00:35:58,383 --> 00:36:00,510
Of course.

322
00:36:01,686 --> 00:36:03,586
I need your help, son.

323
00:36:04,723 --> 00:36:06,748
What do you mean?

324
00:36:06,858 --> 00:36:12,057
- I'm depending on you.
- For what? I don't understand.

325
00:36:12,163 --> 00:36:17,726
To be the eyes, ears
and voice of the Republic.

326
00:36:17,836 --> 00:36:19,963
Anakin...

327
00:36:20,071 --> 00:36:24,235
I'm appointing you to be my personal
representative on the Jedi Council.

328
00:36:24,342 --> 00:36:27,607
Me? A master?

329
00:36:29,214 --> 00:36:31,114
I'm overwhelmed, sir.

330
00:36:33,018 --> 00:36:36,112
But the council elects its own members.
They'll never accept this.

331
00:36:36,221 --> 00:36:39,713
I think they will.
They need you.

332
00:36:39,824 --> 00:36:42,224
More than you know.

333
00:36:52,937 --> 00:36:57,738
Allow this appointment lightly
the council does not.

334
00:36:57,842 --> 00:37:01,243
Disturbing is this move
by Chancellor Palpatine.

335
00:37:02,447 --> 00:37:04,005
I understand.

336
00:37:04,115 --> 00:37:09,178
You are on this council,
but we do not grant you the rank of master.

337
00:37:09,287 --> 00:37:11,312
What?

338
00:37:16,127 --> 00:37:19,790
How can you do this?
This is outrageous.

339
00:37:19,898 --> 00:37:22,025
It's unfair.

340
00:37:23,435 --> 00:37:26,666
How can you be on the council
and not be a master?

341
00:37:26,771 --> 00:37:30,263
Take a seat,
young Skywalker.

342
00:37:33,378 --> 00:37:35,608
Forgive me, Master.

343
00:37:38,717 --> 00:37:41,652
We have surveyed all systems in the Republic...

344
00:37:41,753 --> 00:37:45,484
but have found no sign
of General Grievous.

345
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:48,354
Hiding in the outer rim
Grievous is.

346
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:51,554
The outlying systems
you must sweep.

347
00:37:51,663 --> 00:37:53,893
We do not have
many ships to spare.

348
00:37:53,998 --> 00:37:56,193
What about the droid attack
on the Wookiees?

349
00:37:56,301 --> 00:37:59,998
It is critical we send an attack group
there immediately.

350
00:38:00,105 --> 00:38:03,506
He's right. It's a system
we cannot afford to lose.

351
00:38:04,843 --> 00:38:06,970
Go I will.

352
00:38:07,078 --> 00:38:10,070
Good relations
with the Wookiees I have.

353
00:38:10,181 --> 00:38:14,515
It's settled then.
Yoda will take a battalion of clones...

354
00:38:14,619 --> 00:38:16,917
to reinforce
the Wookiees on Kashyyyk.

355
00:38:17,021 --> 00:38:19,080
May the Force
be with us all.

356
00:38:21,326 --> 00:38:23,954
What kind of nonsense is this?

357
00:38:24,062 --> 00:38:26,496
Put me on the council
and not make me a master?

358
00:38:26,598 --> 00:38:29,294
It's never been done in the history of the Jedi.
It's insulting.

359
00:38:29,401 --> 00:38:32,302
Oh, calm down, Anakin.
You have been given a great honor.

360
00:38:32,404 --> 00:38:36,431
To be on the council at your age-
it's never happened before.

361
00:38:36,541 --> 00:38:39,942
The fact of the matter is
you are too close to the chancellor.

362
00:38:40,044 --> 00:38:43,844
The council doesn't like it
when he interferes in Jedi affairs.

363
00:38:43,948 --> 00:38:49,648
- I swear to you, I didn't ask
to be put on the council.
- But it's what you wanted.

364
00:38:49,754 --> 00:38:53,087
Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine
seems to have paid off.

365
00:38:53,191 --> 00:38:55,091
That has nothing
to do with this.

366
00:38:55,193 --> 00:38:58,128
The only reason the council
has approved your appointment...

367
00:38:58,229 --> 00:39:01,221
is because
the chancellor trusts you.

368
00:39:01,332 --> 00:39:04,358
- And?
- Anakin, I am on your side.

369
00:39:04,469 --> 00:39:07,734
- I didn't want to put you in this situation.
- What situation?

370
00:39:11,843 --> 00:39:16,177
The council wants you to report on
all the chancellor's dealings.

371
00:39:16,281 --> 00:39:18,647
They want to know
what he's up to.

372
00:39:23,188 --> 00:39:26,055
They want me to spy
on the chancellor?

373
00:39:26,157 --> 00:39:28,785
- But that's treason.
- We are at war, Anakin.

374
00:39:30,795 --> 00:39:33,764
Why didn't the council give me
this assignment when we were in session?

375
00:39:33,865 --> 00:39:36,299
This assignment
is not to be on record.

376
00:39:36,401 --> 00:39:40,337
The chancellor
is not a bad man, Obi-Wan.

377
00:39:40,438 --> 00:39:43,464
He befriended me.
He's watched out for me ever since I arrived here.

378
00:39:43,575 --> 00:39:45,668
That is why
you must help us.

379
00:39:45,777 --> 00:39:49,269
Anakin, our allegiance is to the senate,
not to its leader...

380
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:53,077
who has managed to stay in office
long after his term has expired.

381
00:39:53,184 --> 00:39:55,152
The senate demanded
that he stay longer.

382
00:39:55,253 --> 00:39:58,416
Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin.
Something is out of place.

383
00:39:58,523 --> 00:40:03,085
You're asking me to do something
against the Jedi code...

384
00:40:03,194 --> 00:40:06,925
against the Republic,
against a mentor and a friend.

385
00:40:07,031 --> 00:40:10,831
That's what's out of place here.
Why are you asking this of me?

386
00:40:13,137 --> 00:40:15,037
The council
is asking you.

387
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:26,781
Anakin did not take to his new assignment
with much enthusiasm.

388
00:40:26,885 --> 00:40:30,048
It's very dangerous, putting them together.

389
00:40:30,154 --> 00:40:32,486
I don't think
the boy can handle it.

390
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:35,081
I don't trust him.

391
00:40:35,193 --> 00:40:39,061
With all due respect, Master,
is he not the chosen one?

392
00:40:39,163 --> 00:40:42,860
Is he not to destroy the Sith
and bring balance to the Force?

393
00:40:42,967 --> 00:40:45,834
So the prophecy says.

394
00:40:45,937 --> 00:40:50,806
A prophecy
that misread could have been.

395
00:40:52,644 --> 00:40:54,544
He will not let me down.

396
00:40:54,646 --> 00:40:56,580
He never has.

397
00:40:56,681 --> 00:40:59,707
I hope right you are.

398
00:41:23,041 --> 00:41:28,411
Sometimes I wonder
what's happening to the Jedi order.

399
00:41:28,513 --> 00:41:31,539
I think this war is destroying
the principles of the Republic.

400
00:41:33,418 --> 00:41:36,615
Have you ever considered
that we may be on the wrong side?

401
00:41:36,721 --> 00:41:39,212
What do you mean?

402
00:41:39,324 --> 00:41:43,920
What if the democracy we thought
we were serving no longer exists...

403
00:41:44,028 --> 00:41:47,623
and the Republic has become
the very evil we've been fighting to destroy?

404
00:41:47,732 --> 00:41:49,757
I don't believe that.

405
00:41:49,867 --> 00:41:51,960
And you're sounding
like a separatist.

406
00:41:53,972 --> 00:41:56,907
This war represents
a failure to listen.

407
00:41:57,008 --> 00:41:59,033
Now you're closer
to the chancellor than anyone.

408
00:41:59,143 --> 00:42:02,408
Please, ask him to stop the fighting
and let diplomacy resume.

409
00:42:02,513 --> 00:42:05,038
Don't ask me to do that.

410
00:42:06,651 --> 00:42:10,280
Make a motion in the senate,
where that kind of a request belongs.

411
00:42:10,388 --> 00:42:13,186
- What is it?
- Nothing.

412
00:42:14,525 --> 00:42:18,359
Don't do this. Don't shut me out.
Let me help you.

413
00:42:20,431 --> 00:42:22,797
Hold me.

414
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:26,028
Like you did
by the lake on Naboo.

415
00:42:26,137 --> 00:42:29,937
So long ago, when there was
nothing but our love.

416
00:42:30,041 --> 00:42:33,477
No politics,
no plotting, no war.

417
00:43:12,717 --> 00:43:16,050
- You wanted to see me, Chancellor.
- Yes, Anakin. Come closer.

418
00:43:16,154 --> 00:43:18,782
I have good news.

419
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:24,226
Our clone intelligence units have discovered
the location of General Grievous.

420
00:43:24,328 --> 00:43:26,228
He's hiding
in the Utapau system.

421
00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:28,230
At last.

422
00:43:29,634 --> 00:43:32,831
We'll be able to capture
that monster and end this war.

423
00:43:32,937 --> 00:43:36,304
I would worry about
the collective wisdom of the council...

424
00:43:36,407 --> 00:43:38,807
if it didn't select you
for this assignment.

425
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:42,243
You're the best
choice, by far.

426
00:43:43,681 --> 00:43:46,673
Hmm. Sit down.

427
00:43:46,784 --> 00:43:48,684
Leave us.

428
00:44:00,665 --> 00:44:02,565
Anakin...

429
00:44:02,667 --> 00:44:07,104
you know I'm not able
to rely on the Jedi Council.

430
00:44:08,873 --> 00:44:13,071
If they haven't included you
in their plot, they soon will.

431
00:44:13,177 --> 00:44:15,270
I'm not sure
I understand.

432
00:44:15,379 --> 00:44:19,076
You must sense
what I have come to suspect.

433
00:44:19,183 --> 00:44:22,550
The Jedi Council want
control of the Republic.

434
00:44:23,955 --> 00:44:26,446
They're planning
to betray me.

435
00:44:26,557 --> 00:44:28,957
- I don't think that-
- Anakin.

436
00:44:30,161 --> 00:44:32,061
Search your feelings.

437
00:44:34,265 --> 00:44:36,825
You know, don't you?

438
00:44:41,239 --> 00:44:44,333
- I know they don't trust you.
- Hmm. Or the senate.

439
00:44:44,442 --> 00:44:49,277
Or the Republic, or democracy,
for that matter.

440
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:54,408
I have to admit,
my trust in them has been shaken.

441
00:44:54,519 --> 00:44:56,487
Why?

442
00:44:58,055 --> 00:45:00,080
They asked you
to do something...

443
00:45:00,191 --> 00:45:02,455
that made you feel dishonest,
didn't they?

444
00:45:05,496 --> 00:45:08,329
They asked you to spy
on me, didn't they?

445
00:45:12,904 --> 00:45:15,372
I don't, uh-

446
00:45:15,473 --> 00:45:17,407
I don't know
what to say.

447
00:45:17,508 --> 00:45:21,069
Remember back
to your early teachings.

448
00:45:21,179 --> 00:45:25,479
All who gain power
are afraid to lose it.

449
00:45:25,583 --> 00:45:30,247
- Even the Jedi.
- The Jedi use their power for good.

450
00:45:30,354 --> 00:45:32,481
Good is a point of view,
Anakin.

451
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:37,755
The Sith and the Jedi
are similar in almost every way...

452
00:45:39,797 --> 00:45:42,561
including their quest
for greater power.

453
00:45:44,101 --> 00:45:47,127
The Sith rely on their passion
for their strength.

454
00:45:47,238 --> 00:45:50,002
They think inwards-
only about themselves.

455
00:45:51,209 --> 00:45:53,439
And the Jedi don't?

456
00:45:53,544 --> 00:45:58,106
The Jedi are selfless.
They only care about others.

457
00:46:08,292 --> 00:46:13,252
Did you ever hear the tragedy
of Darth Plagueis the Wise?

458
00:46:17,501 --> 00:46:19,935
- No.
- I thought not.

459
00:46:20,037 --> 00:46:22,437
It's not a story
the Jedi would tell you.

460
00:46:23,908 --> 00:46:26,240
It's a Sith legend.

461
00:46:26,344 --> 00:46:28,244
Darth Plagueis...

462
00:46:28,346 --> 00:46:34,012
was a dark lord of the Sith
so powerful and so wise...

463
00:46:34,118 --> 00:46:38,953
he could use the Force to
influence the midi-chlorians...

464
00:46:39,056 --> 00:46:42,253
to create... life.

465
00:46:43,928 --> 00:46:46,954
He had such a knowledge
of the dark side...

466
00:46:47,064 --> 00:46:52,092
he could even keep
the ones he cared about...

467
00:46:52,203 --> 00:46:54,103
from dying.

468
00:46:58,442 --> 00:47:02,242
He could actually...
save people from death?

469
00:47:02,346 --> 00:47:07,613
The dark side of the Force is
a pathway to many abilities...

470
00:47:07,718 --> 00:47:11,950
some consider to be unnatural.

471
00:47:13,057 --> 00:47:14,922
Wh-What happened to him?

472
00:47:15,026 --> 00:47:18,086
He became so powerful...

473
00:47:19,363 --> 00:47:22,332
the only thing
he was afraid of was...

474
00:47:22,433 --> 00:47:24,333
losing his power.

475
00:47:24,435 --> 00:47:27,893
Which eventually,
of course, he did.

476
00:47:28,005 --> 00:47:33,875
Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice
everything he knew.

477
00:47:33,978 --> 00:47:37,641
Then his apprentice
killed him in his sleep.

478
00:47:39,784 --> 00:47:41,684
It's ironic.

479
00:47:41,786 --> 00:47:43,811
He could save
others from death...

480
00:47:44,922 --> 00:47:47,015
but not himself.

481
00:47:51,195 --> 00:47:53,720
Is it possible
to learn this power?

482
00:47:57,568 --> 00:47:59,695
Not from a Jedi.

483
00:48:16,587 --> 00:48:18,487
All Red units, over here!

484
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:33,366
Palpatine thinks General Grievous is on Utapau?

485
00:48:33,471 --> 00:48:36,531
A partial message was intercepted
in a diplomatic packet...

486
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:39,768
- from the chairman of Utapau.
- Hmm.

487
00:48:39,877 --> 00:48:42,607
Act on this we must.

488
00:48:42,713 --> 00:48:47,446
The capture of General Grievous
will end this war.

489
00:48:47,551 --> 00:48:51,385
Quickly and decisively
we should proceed.

490
00:48:51,489 --> 00:48:56,517
The chancellor has requested...
that I lead the campaign.

491
00:48:56,627 --> 00:48:59,960
The council will make up
its own mind who is to go...

492
00:49:00,064 --> 00:49:02,032
not the chancellor.

493
00:49:02,133 --> 00:49:07,070
A master is needed,
with more experience.

494
00:49:07,171 --> 00:49:11,665
I concur.
Master Kenobi should go.

495
00:49:11,776 --> 00:49:14,142
- I agree.
- Aye.

496
00:49:14,245 --> 00:49:16,145
Aye.

497
00:49:16,247 --> 00:49:19,944
Very well. Council adjourned.

498
00:49:25,656 --> 00:49:28,750
- The droids have started up
their main power generators.

499
00:49:28,859 --> 00:49:34,320
- Then now the time is, Commander.
- Yes, sir.

500
00:49:46,544 --> 00:49:48,512
Charge!

501
00:50:03,461 --> 00:50:05,361
Head for cover!

502
00:50:20,978 --> 00:50:23,845
- You're gonna need me on this one, Master.
- Oh, I agree.

503
00:50:23,948 --> 00:50:28,044
- However, it may turn out
just to be a wild bantha chase.
- Master.

504
00:50:29,987 --> 00:50:35,323
I've disappointed you. Uh, I haven't been
very appreciative of your training.

505
00:50:35,426 --> 00:50:39,829
I've been arrogant,
and I apologize.

506
00:50:39,930 --> 00:50:42,296
I've just been so frustrated
with the council.

507
00:50:45,603 --> 00:50:49,334
You are strong and wise, Anakin,
and I am very proud of you.

508
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:52,068
I have trained you since
you were a small boy.

509
00:50:52,176 --> 00:50:54,269
I have taught you
everything I know.

510
00:50:54,378 --> 00:50:58,109
And you have become a far greater Jedi
than I could ever hope to be.

511
00:50:58,215 --> 00:51:00,911
But be patient, Anakin.

512
00:51:01,018 --> 00:51:04,954
It will not be long before the council
makes you a Jedi master.

513
00:51:12,363 --> 00:51:15,628
Obi-Wan.
May the Force be with you.

514
00:51:15,733 --> 00:51:18,600
Good-bye, old friend.
May the Force be with you.

515
00:51:41,225 --> 00:51:45,787
Fortunately, most of the cities are
concentrated on this small continent here.

516
00:51:45,896 --> 00:51:49,957
- On the far side.
- I'll keep them distracted until you get there.

517
00:51:50,067 --> 00:51:53,468
- Just don't take too long.
- Come on. When have I ever let you down?

518
00:51:53,571 --> 00:51:55,471
Very well.

519
00:51:55,573 --> 00:52:00,010
The burden is on me not to destroy
all the droids until you arrive.

520
00:52:25,669 --> 00:52:27,569
Save your energy.

521
00:52:27,671 --> 00:52:29,696
I can't.

522
00:52:29,807 --> 00:52:31,570
Don't give up, Padmé.

523
00:52:45,055 --> 00:52:47,523
Obi-Wan's been here,
hasn't he?

524
00:52:47,625 --> 00:52:49,650
He came by this morning.

525
00:52:51,061 --> 00:52:52,961
What did he want?

526
00:52:53,063 --> 00:52:54,997
He's worried about you.

527
00:52:57,501 --> 00:53:01,437
He says you've been under a lot of stress.

528
00:53:01,538 --> 00:53:04,302
I feel lost.

529
00:53:05,442 --> 00:53:08,570
Lost? What do you mean?

530
00:53:10,514 --> 00:53:12,880
Obi-Wan and the council
don't trust me.

531
00:53:12,983 --> 00:53:16,384
They trust you
with their lives.

532
00:53:18,155 --> 00:53:20,214
Something's happening.

533
00:53:20,324 --> 00:53:22,952
I'm not the Jedi
I should be.

534
00:53:25,329 --> 00:53:27,229
I want more.

535
00:53:28,465 --> 00:53:30,365
And I know I shouldn't.

536
00:53:32,503 --> 00:53:34,471
You expect too much
of yourself.

537
00:53:38,442 --> 00:53:41,639
- I found a way to save you.
- Save me?

538
00:53:41,745 --> 00:53:43,679
From my nightmares.

539
00:53:43,781 --> 00:53:45,715
Is that what's
bothering you?

540
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:49,412
I won't lose you, Padmé.

541
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,613
I'm not gonna die
in childbirth, Ani.

542
00:53:51,722 --> 00:53:54,122
- I promise you.
- No, I promise you.

543
00:54:38,102 --> 00:54:40,502
Greetings, young Jedi.

544
00:54:40,604 --> 00:54:44,040
What brings you to
our remote sanctuary?

545
00:54:44,141 --> 00:54:46,075
Unfortunately, the war.

546
00:54:46,176 --> 00:54:50,738
There's no war here-
unless you brought it with you.

547
00:54:50,848 --> 00:54:54,045
With your kind permission,
I should like some fuel...

548
00:54:54,151 --> 00:54:59,987
and to use your city as a base as I search
nearby systems for General Grievous.

549
00:55:08,098 --> 00:55:11,363
He is here.
We are being held hostage.

550
00:55:11,468 --> 00:55:14,369
- They are watching us.
- I understand.

551
00:55:14,471 --> 00:55:19,272
Tenth level,
thousands of battle droids.

552
00:55:19,376 --> 00:55:21,844
Tell your people
to take shelter.

553
00:55:21,945 --> 00:55:24,914
If you have warriors,
now is the time.

554
00:55:35,826 --> 00:55:40,024
Take the fighter back to the ship.
Tell Cody I've made contact.

555
00:55:41,999 --> 00:55:46,060
- Is he bringing additional warriors?
- He didn't say.

556
00:56:28,412 --> 00:56:33,645
It won't be long before the armies
of the Republic track us here.

557
00:56:36,253 --> 00:56:41,452
I am sending you to the Mustafar system
in the outer rim.

558
00:56:48,966 --> 00:56:51,298
It is a volcanic planet.

559
00:56:51,401 --> 00:56:54,700
- You will be safe there.
- Safe?

560
00:56:54,805 --> 00:56:58,798
Hmph! Chancellor Palpatine
managed to escape your grip, General.

561
00:56:58,909 --> 00:57:03,346
Without Count Dooku, I have doubts
about your ability to keep us safe.

562
00:57:03,447 --> 00:57:06,382
Be thankful, Viceroy...

563
00:57:06,483 --> 00:57:09,384
you have not
found yourself in my grip.

564
00:57:12,890 --> 00:57:16,348
Your ship is waiting.

565
00:57:32,476 --> 00:57:34,637
Hello there.

566
00:57:36,613 --> 00:57:41,880
General Kenobi.

567
00:57:41,985 --> 00:57:44,510
You are a bold one.

568
00:57:44,621 --> 00:57:48,022
Kill him.

569
00:58:03,874 --> 00:58:06,001
Back away.

570
00:58:06,109 --> 00:58:10,045
I will deal with
this Jedi slime myself.

571
00:58:10,147 --> 00:58:12,342
Your move.

572
00:58:12,449 --> 00:58:14,349
You fool.

573
00:58:14,451 --> 00:58:20,048
I've been trained in your
Jedi arts by Count Dooku.

574
00:58:26,630 --> 00:58:29,064
Attack, Kenobi.

575
00:59:45,442 --> 00:59:47,774
Army or not...

576
00:59:47,878 --> 00:59:52,975
you must realize
you are doomed.

577
00:59:53,083 --> 00:59:55,051
Oh, I don't think so.

578
01:00:24,081 --> 01:00:26,743
Uh-oh.

579
01:00:31,888 --> 01:00:33,856
Hyah!

580
01:00:52,609 --> 01:00:54,804
Cover that corner.

581
01:01:01,284 --> 01:01:03,343
Master Windu, may I interrupt?

582
01:01:03,453 --> 01:01:06,217
General Kenobi has made contact
with General Grievous...

583
01:01:06,323 --> 01:01:08,587
and we have begun our attack.

584
01:01:08,692 --> 01:01:11,092
Thank you, Commander.

585
01:01:11,194 --> 01:01:14,357
Anakin, deliver this report
to the chancellor.

586
01:01:14,464 --> 01:01:17,024
His reaction will give us
a clue to his intentions.

587
01:01:17,134 --> 01:01:19,227
Yes, Master.

588
01:01:26,042 --> 01:01:29,307
I sense a plot
to destroy the Jedi.

589
01:01:29,412 --> 01:01:32,040
The dark side of the Force
surrounds the chancellor.

590
01:01:32,149 --> 01:01:36,483
If he does not give up his emergency powers
after the destruction of Grievous...

591
01:01:36,586 --> 01:01:39,146
then he should be removed
from office.

592
01:01:39,256 --> 01:01:42,919
The Jedi Council would have to
take control of the senate...

593
01:01:43,026 --> 01:01:45,153
in order to secure
a peaceful transition.

594
01:01:45,262 --> 01:01:49,722
To a dark place this line
of thought will carry us.

595
01:01:49,833 --> 01:01:55,465
Hmm. Great care
we must take.

596
01:02:01,545 --> 01:02:03,672
Chancellor.

597
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:06,305
We've just received a report
from Master Kenobi.

598
01:02:06,416 --> 01:02:09,078
He has engaged
General Grievous.

599
01:02:09,186 --> 01:02:12,519
We can only hope that Master Kenobi
is up to the challenge.

600
01:02:14,390 --> 01:02:16,358
I should be there with him.

601
01:02:16,459 --> 01:02:18,825
It's upsetting to me
to see that the council...

602
01:02:18,928 --> 01:02:22,193
doesn't seem to fully appreciate
your talents.

603
01:02:22,298 --> 01:02:26,394
Don't you wonder
why they won't make you a Jedi master?

604
01:02:28,104 --> 01:02:30,072
I wish I knew.

605
01:02:31,407 --> 01:02:33,898
More and more I get
the feeling that...

606
01:02:34,010 --> 01:02:36,240
I'm being excluded
from the council.

607
01:02:43,252 --> 01:02:47,154
I know there are things about the Force
that they're not telling me.

608
01:02:49,425 --> 01:02:51,825
They don't trust you, Anakin.

609
01:02:51,928 --> 01:02:54,590
They see your future.

610
01:02:54,697 --> 01:02:59,657
They know your power
will be too strong to control.

611
01:02:59,769 --> 01:03:05,503
You must break through the fog of lies
the Jedi have created around you.

612
01:03:06,843 --> 01:03:10,973
Let me help you to know
the subtleties of the Force.

613
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:13,844
How do you know the ways of the Force?

614
01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:18,614
My mentor taught me
everything about the Force.

615
01:03:18,721 --> 01:03:21,690
Even the nature of
the dark side.

616
01:03:23,693 --> 01:03:26,025
You know the dark side?

617
01:03:26,129 --> 01:03:28,563
Anakin...

618
01:03:28,664 --> 01:03:31,963
if one is to understand
the great mystery...

619
01:03:32,068 --> 01:03:34,628
one must study
all its aspects...

620
01:03:34,737 --> 01:03:37,706
not just the dogmatic
narrow view of the Jedi.

621
01:03:37,807 --> 01:03:41,607
If you wish to become
a complete and wise leader...

622
01:03:41,711 --> 01:03:45,374
you must embrace a larger view
of the Force.

623
01:03:45,481 --> 01:03:48,075
Be careful of the Jedi,
Anakin.

624
01:03:48,184 --> 01:03:50,379
Only through me...

625
01:03:50,486 --> 01:03:54,354
can you achieve a power
greater than any Jedi.

626
01:03:54,457 --> 01:03:57,756
Learn to know
the dark side of the Force...

627
01:03:57,860 --> 01:04:01,523
and you will be able to
save your wife...

628
01:04:01,631 --> 01:04:03,656
from certain death.

629
01:04:04,801 --> 01:04:06,701
What did you say?

630
01:04:06,803 --> 01:04:10,432
Use my knowledge.
I beg you.

631
01:04:12,141 --> 01:04:14,302
You're the Sith lord.

632
01:04:14,410 --> 01:04:18,278
I know what's been troubling you.
Listen to me.

633
01:04:18,381 --> 01:04:22,943
Don't continue to be a pawn
of the Jedi Council.

634
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:28,545
Ever since I've known you,
you've been searching for a life...

635
01:04:28,658 --> 01:04:31,218
greater than that
of an ordinary Jedi.

636
01:04:31,327 --> 01:04:33,693
A life of significance...

637
01:04:33,796 --> 01:04:36,162
of conscience.

638
01:04:40,336 --> 01:04:44,568
- Are you going to kill me?
- I would certainly like to.

639
01:04:45,675 --> 01:04:48,075
I know you would.

640
01:04:48,177 --> 01:04:51,977
I can feel your anger.

641
01:04:52,081 --> 01:04:54,777
It gives you focus...

642
01:04:54,884 --> 01:04:57,216
makes you stronger.

643
01:05:03,493 --> 01:05:07,623
- I'm going to turn you over to the Jedi Council.
- Of course. You should.

644
01:05:07,730 --> 01:05:10,756
But you're not sure
of their intentions, are you?

645
01:05:10,867 --> 01:05:14,394
I will quickly discover
the truth of all this.

646
01:05:14,504 --> 01:05:16,938
You have great wisdom,
Anakin.

647
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:20,668
Know the power
of the dark side.

648
01:05:20,776 --> 01:05:23,540
Power to save Padmé.

649
01:06:52,735 --> 01:06:55,795
Aaah!

650
01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:33,240
So uncivilized.

651
01:07:40,411 --> 01:07:42,436
Master Windu, I must talk to you.

652
01:07:42,546 --> 01:07:46,607
Skywalker, we just received word
that Obi-Wan has destroyed General Grievous.

653
01:07:46,717 --> 01:07:50,653
We're on our way to make sure the chancellor
returns emergency power back to the senate.

654
01:07:50,754 --> 01:07:54,485
He won't give up his power.
I've just learned a terrible truth.

655
01:07:54,591 --> 01:07:57,685
I think Chancellor Palpatine
is a Sith lord.

656
01:07:57,795 --> 01:07:59,763
A Sith lord?

657
01:07:59,863 --> 01:08:02,696
Yes. The one we've been
looking for.

658
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:06,759
- How do you know this?
- He knows the ways of the Force.

659
01:08:06,870 --> 01:08:08,997
He's been trained
to use the dark side.

660
01:08:09,106 --> 01:08:11,904
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

661
01:08:13,377 --> 01:08:15,607
Then our worst fears
have been realized.

662
01:08:15,713 --> 01:08:19,171
We must move quickly
if the Jedi order is to survive.

663
01:08:19,283 --> 01:08:21,717
Master, the chancellor
is very powerful.

664
01:08:21,819 --> 01:08:24,117
You'll need my help
if you're going to arrest him.

665
01:08:24,221 --> 01:08:27,156
For you own good,
stay out of this affair.

666
01:08:27,257 --> 01:08:30,021
I sense a great deal of confusion in you,
young Skywalker.

667
01:08:30,127 --> 01:08:32,288
There is much fear that
clouds your judgment.

668
01:08:32,396 --> 01:08:34,557
- I must go, Master.
- No.

669
01:08:36,567 --> 01:08:38,535
If what you've
told me is true...

670
01:08:38,635 --> 01:08:40,535
you will have
gained my trust.

671
01:08:40,637 --> 01:08:43,162
But for now, remain here.

672
01:08:44,408 --> 01:08:47,206
Wait in the council chambers
until we return.

673
01:08:48,545 --> 01:08:50,740
Yes, Master.

674
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:23,105
You do know, don't you...

675
01:09:23,213 --> 01:09:25,579
if the Jedi destroy me...

676
01:09:25,682 --> 01:09:29,641
any chance of saving her
will be lost.

677
01:10:58,575 --> 01:11:03,012
Master Windu. I take it General Grievous
has been destroyed then.

678
01:11:03,113 --> 01:11:06,378
I must say you're here
sooner than expected.

679
01:11:06,483 --> 01:11:10,112
In the name of
the Galactic Senate of the Republic...

680
01:11:10,220 --> 01:11:12,154
you're under arrest,
Chancellor.

681
01:11:12,256 --> 01:11:14,850
Are you threatening me,
Master Jedi?

682
01:11:14,958 --> 01:11:16,892
The senate will decide
your fate.

683
01:11:16,994 --> 01:11:20,828
- I am the senate.
- Not yet.

684
01:11:26,169 --> 01:11:28,501
It's treason then.

685
01:13:06,269 --> 01:13:11,036
You are under arrest,
my lord.

686
01:13:12,175 --> 01:13:14,735
Anakin, I told you
it would come to this.

687
01:13:14,845 --> 01:13:16,472
I was right.

688
01:13:16,580 --> 01:13:18,741
The Jedi are taking over.

689
01:13:18,849 --> 01:13:21,317
The oppression of the Sith
will never return.

690
01:13:21,418 --> 01:13:23,648
You have lost.

691
01:13:23,754 --> 01:13:25,722
No.

692
01:13:25,822 --> 01:13:29,417
No. No.
You will die!

693
01:13:31,528 --> 01:13:34,088
He's a traitor!

694
01:13:34,197 --> 01:13:37,462
He is the traitor!

695
01:13:39,202 --> 01:13:43,696
I have the power
to save the one you love.

696
01:13:43,807 --> 01:13:46,605
You must choose.

697
01:13:47,711 --> 01:13:50,271
Don't listen to him, Anakin!

698
01:13:51,381 --> 01:13:53,975
Don't let him kill me.

699
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:59,816
I can't hold it any longer.

700
01:13:59,923 --> 01:14:03,290
I-I-I-I can't.
I-I-I'm weak.

701
01:14:03,393 --> 01:14:05,361
I'm-I'm too weak.

702
01:14:05,462 --> 01:14:06,895
Anakin.

703
01:14:06,997 --> 01:14:09,465
Help me. Help me!

704
01:14:12,636 --> 01:14:16,163
I-I-I can't
hold on any longer.

705
01:14:16,273 --> 01:14:19,401
I am going to end this
once and for all.

706
01:14:19,509 --> 01:14:21,477
You can't.

707
01:14:21,578 --> 01:14:23,512
He must stand trial.

708
01:14:23,613 --> 01:14:27,014
He has control of
the senate and the courts.

709
01:14:27,117 --> 01:14:29,347
He's too dangerous
to be left alive.

710
01:14:29,453 --> 01:14:33,412
I'm too weak.
Oh. Don't kill me. Please.

711
01:14:33,523 --> 01:14:35,423
It's not the Jedi way.

712
01:14:35,525 --> 01:14:37,049
He must live.

713
01:14:39,329 --> 01:14:41,320
Please don't.

714
01:14:41,431 --> 01:14:43,661
I need him.

715
01:14:43,767 --> 01:14:45,997
- Please don't!
- No!

716
01:14:52,242 --> 01:14:54,767
Power!

717
01:14:59,683 --> 01:15:05,121
Unlimited power!

718
01:15:15,565 --> 01:15:18,295
What have I done?

719
01:15:26,576 --> 01:15:31,604
You're fulfilling
your destiny, Anakin.

720
01:15:31,715 --> 01:15:34,445
Become my apprentice.

721
01:15:34,551 --> 01:15:39,989
Learn to use
the dark side of the Force.

722
01:15:42,659 --> 01:15:45,628
I will do
whatever you ask.

723
01:15:47,063 --> 01:15:50,226
Good.

724
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:54,529
Just help me save
Padmé's life.

725
01:15:56,506 --> 01:15:58,872
I can't live without her.

726
01:16:02,045 --> 01:16:06,448
To cheat death is a power
only one has achieved...

727
01:16:06,550 --> 01:16:10,748
but if we work together...

728
01:16:10,854 --> 01:16:14,654
I know we can discover
the secret.

729
01:16:16,092 --> 01:16:18,390
I pledge myself...

730
01:16:19,796 --> 01:16:22,822
to your teachings.

731
01:16:22,933 --> 01:16:24,958
Good.

732
01:16:25,068 --> 01:16:27,628
Good.

733
01:16:35,912 --> 01:16:40,349
The Force is strong
with you.

734
01:16:40,450 --> 01:16:46,013
A powerful Sith
you will become.

735
01:16:46,122 --> 01:16:50,388
Henceforth
you shall be known as...

736
01:16:50,493 --> 01:16:53,121
Darth...

737
01:16:53,230 --> 01:16:55,198
Vader.

738
01:16:59,336 --> 01:17:02,362
Thank you, my master.

739
01:17:04,574 --> 01:17:06,542
Rise.

740
01:17:19,689 --> 01:17:24,626
Because the council did not trust you,
my young apprentice...

741
01:17:26,196 --> 01:17:30,963
I believe you are the only Jedi
with no knowledge of this plot.

742
01:17:32,302 --> 01:17:35,032
When the Jedi learn
what has transpired here...

743
01:17:35,138 --> 01:17:37,106
they will kill us...

744
01:17:37,207 --> 01:17:39,835
along with all the senators.

745
01:17:39,943 --> 01:17:41,911
I agree.

746
01:17:42,012 --> 01:17:45,607
The council's next move
will be against the senate.

747
01:17:45,715 --> 01:17:48,707
Every single Jedi...

748
01:17:48,818 --> 01:17:52,083
including your friend
Obi-Wan Kenobi...

749
01:17:52,188 --> 01:17:55,749
is now an enemy
of the Republic.

750
01:17:56,793 --> 01:17:58,761
I understand, Master.

751
01:17:58,862 --> 01:18:01,456
We must move quickly.

752
01:18:01,564 --> 01:18:03,532
The Jedi are relentless.

753
01:18:03,633 --> 01:18:09,435
If they are not all destroyed,
it will be civil war without end.

754
01:18:11,141 --> 01:18:14,907
First I want you to
go to the Jedi temple.

755
01:18:16,012 --> 01:18:19,543
We will catch them
off-balance.

756
01:18:19,578 --> 01:18:23,074
Do what must be done,
Lord Vader.

757
01:18:23,186 --> 01:18:27,179
Do not hesitate.
Show no mercy.

758
01:18:27,290 --> 01:18:32,057
Only then will you be strong enough
with the dark side...

759
01:18:32,162 --> 01:18:35,188
to save Padmé.

760
01:18:35,298 --> 01:18:39,166
What about the other Jedi
spread across the galaxy?

761
01:18:39,269 --> 01:18:42,329
Their betrayal
will be dealt with.

762
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:47,539
After you have killed all the Jedi
in the temple...

763
01:18:47,644 --> 01:18:50,340
go to the Mustafar system.

764
01:18:50,447 --> 01:18:53,712
Wipe out Viceroy Gunray...

765
01:18:53,817 --> 01:18:57,253
and the other
separatist leaders.

766
01:18:57,354 --> 01:19:03,259
Once more the Sith
will rule the galaxy!

767
01:19:04,494 --> 01:19:06,394
And...

768
01:19:06,496 --> 01:19:11,263
we shall have... peace.

769
01:19:54,611 --> 01:19:57,444
Sergeant, over here!

770
01:19:57,547 --> 01:19:59,481
Hurry! Follow them!

771
01:20:01,584 --> 01:20:04,144
All Red units,
let's move it!

772
01:20:04,254 --> 01:20:06,154
Come on. Let's go!

773
01:20:20,036 --> 01:20:22,027
Commander, contact
your troops.

774
01:20:22,138 --> 01:20:24,106
Tell them to move to
the higher levels.

775
01:20:24,207 --> 01:20:26,107
Very good, sir.

776
01:20:26,209 --> 01:20:28,336
Oh, by the way,
I think you'll be needing this.

777
01:20:28,445 --> 01:20:32,006
Thank you, Cody. Now let's get a move on.
We've got a battle to win here.

778
01:20:32,115 --> 01:20:34,015
- Hyah!
- Yes, sir.

779
01:20:40,790 --> 01:20:42,849
Commander Cody...

780
01:20:42,959 --> 01:20:46,292
the time has come.

781
01:20:46,396 --> 01:20:50,628
Execute order 66.

782
01:20:50,733 --> 01:20:52,701
Yes, my lord.

783
01:20:57,173 --> 01:20:59,698
Blast him!

784
01:21:24,634 --> 01:21:26,898
Come on!

785
01:22:16,986 --> 01:22:21,480
Execute order 66.

786
01:22:21,591 --> 01:22:23,718
It will be done, my lord.

787
01:23:06,069 --> 01:23:08,333
It will be done, my lord.

788
01:23:44,874 --> 01:23:47,308
Master Skywalker,
there are too many of them.

789
01:23:47,410 --> 01:23:49,378
What are we going to do?

790
01:23:59,856 --> 01:24:04,020
The chancellor's office indicated
Master Anakin returned to the Jedi temple.

791
01:24:04,127 --> 01:24:07,187
Don't worry.
I'm sure he'll be all right.

792
01:24:36,459 --> 01:24:39,519
- What's going on here?
- There's been a rebellion, sir.

793
01:24:39,629 --> 01:24:42,189
Don't worry.
The situation is under control.

794
01:24:42,298 --> 01:24:45,529
I'm sorry, sir.
It's time for you to leave.

795
01:24:47,270 --> 01:24:49,238
And so it is.

796
01:24:52,875 --> 01:24:55,537
Get him!

797
01:25:06,222 --> 01:25:08,087
No!

798
01:25:11,728 --> 01:25:14,253
Don't worry about him.
Let him go.

799
01:25:41,190 --> 01:25:44,125
All these Wookiees are dead.
Move to the east.

800
01:25:44,227 --> 01:25:46,195
Yes, sir.

801
01:25:53,803 --> 01:25:55,703
Good-bye, Tarfful.

802
01:25:55,805 --> 01:25:57,773
Good-bye, Chewbacca.

803
01:25:59,609 --> 01:26:02,510
Miss you I will.

804
01:26:39,515 --> 01:26:41,813
Hopefully we'll be able to
intercept a few Jedi...

805
01:26:41,918 --> 01:26:44,284
before they walk into
this catastrophe.

806
01:26:49,959 --> 01:26:51,893
Did you find Kenobi?

807
01:26:51,994 --> 01:26:53,985
Sir, no one could have
survived that fall.

808
01:26:54,096 --> 01:26:57,395
Start loading your men on the ships.

809
01:26:57,500 --> 01:27:00,264
Move it.

810
01:27:32,301 --> 01:27:34,292
Emergency code 913.

811
01:27:34,403 --> 01:27:36,303
I have no contact
on any frequency.

812
01:27:38,374 --> 01:27:40,467
Master Kenobi.

813
01:27:40,576 --> 01:27:42,567
- Repeat.
- Master Kenobi.

814
01:27:42,678 --> 01:27:46,580
Senator Organa.
My clone troops turned on me. I need help.

815
01:27:46,682 --> 01:27:49,276
We have just rescued
Master Yoda.

816
01:27:49,385 --> 01:27:51,717
It appears this ambush
has happened everywhere.

817
01:27:51,821 --> 01:27:53,948
We're sending you
our coordinates.

818
01:28:00,663 --> 01:28:03,598
Hush! Not so loud.

819
01:28:03,699 --> 01:28:06,725
Are you all right? I heard there was
an attack on the Jedi temple.

820
01:28:06,836 --> 01:28:09,304
- You could see the smoke from here.
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

821
01:28:09,405 --> 01:28:12,932
- I came to see if you and the baby are safe.
- What's happening?

822
01:28:13,042 --> 01:28:15,909
The Jedi have tried to
overthrow the Republic.

823
01:28:16,012 --> 01:28:18,572
I can't believe that.

824
01:28:18,681 --> 01:28:23,243
I saw Master Windu attempt
to assassinate the chancellor myself.

825
01:28:23,352 --> 01:28:26,810
Oh, Anakin.
What are you gonna do?

826
01:28:35,498 --> 01:28:37,693
I will not betray
the Republic.

827
01:28:39,702 --> 01:28:42,671
My loyalties lie
with the chancellor...

828
01:28:42,772 --> 01:28:45,502
and with the senate
and with you.

829
01:28:45,608 --> 01:28:47,803
What about Obi-Wan?

830
01:28:47,910 --> 01:28:50,140
I don't know.

831
01:28:50,246 --> 01:28:52,339
Many Jedi
have been killed.

832
01:28:52,448 --> 01:28:56,248
We can only hope
that he's remained loyal to the chancellor.

833
01:28:56,352 --> 01:28:58,718
Anakin, I'm afraid.

834
01:29:00,656 --> 01:29:03,784
Have faith, my love.

835
01:29:03,893 --> 01:29:06,191
Everything will soon
be set right.

836
01:29:06,295 --> 01:29:09,696
The chancellor has given me
a very important mission.

837
01:29:09,799 --> 01:29:12,996
The separatists have gathered
on the Mustafar system.

838
01:29:13,102 --> 01:29:15,627
I'm going there
to end this war.

839
01:29:15,738 --> 01:29:17,638
Wait for me until I return.

840
01:29:17,740 --> 01:29:20,106
Things will be different.
I promise.

841
01:29:25,948 --> 01:29:27,916
Please, wait for me.

842
01:29:31,988 --> 01:29:34,718
Well, he is under
a lot of stress, R2.

843
01:29:36,959 --> 01:29:38,859
Take care,
my little friend.

844
01:29:43,165 --> 01:29:46,862
Oh, my lady, is there
anything I might do?

845
01:29:46,969 --> 01:29:49,494
No, thank you, 3PO.

846
01:29:49,605 --> 01:29:54,304
Oh. I-
I feel so helpless.

847
01:30:17,166 --> 01:30:20,499
How many other Jedi
have managed to survive?

848
01:30:20,603 --> 01:30:23,936
Heard from no one
have we.

849
01:30:24,040 --> 01:30:27,134
I saw thousands of troops
attack the Jedi temple.

850
01:30:27,243 --> 01:30:29,143
That's why I went
looking for Yoda.

851
01:30:29,245 --> 01:30:31,805
Have we had any contact
from the temple?

852
01:30:31,914 --> 01:30:34,781
Received a coded
retreat message we have.

853
01:30:34,884 --> 01:30:38,911
It requests all Jedi
to return to the temple.

854
01:30:39,021 --> 01:30:42,457
- It says the war is over.
- Well, then we must go back.

855
01:30:42,558 --> 01:30:46,050
If there are any stragglers,
they will fall into the trap and be killed.

856
01:30:46,162 --> 01:30:50,997
Hmm. Suggest dismantling
the coded signal, do you?

857
01:30:51,100 --> 01:30:53,830
Yes, Master.
There is too much at stake.

858
01:30:53,936 --> 01:30:56,496
I agree.

859
01:30:56,605 --> 01:31:00,200
And a little more knowledge
might light our way.

860
01:31:21,197 --> 01:31:24,633
The plan has gone
as you had promised, my lord.

861
01:31:24,734 --> 01:31:27,498
You have done well,
Viceroy.

862
01:31:27,603 --> 01:31:33,439
When my new apprentice
Darth Vader arrives...

863
01:31:33,542 --> 01:31:37,034
he will take care of you.

864
01:31:48,657 --> 01:31:51,785
We're receiving a message from
the chancellor's office, sir.

865
01:31:51,894 --> 01:31:53,862
- Send it through.
- Yes, sir.

866
01:31:55,598 --> 01:32:00,297
Senator Organa, the supreme chancellor
requests your presence...

867
01:32:00,402 --> 01:32:02,370
at a special session
of Congress.

868
01:32:02,471 --> 01:32:05,998
- I will be there.
- He'll be expecting you.

869
01:32:09,011 --> 01:32:12,310
- Could be a trap.
- I don't think so.

870
01:32:12,414 --> 01:32:15,508
The chancellor will not be able
to control the thousands of star systems...

871
01:32:15,618 --> 01:32:17,518
without keeping
the senate intact.

872
01:32:17,620 --> 01:32:21,681
If a special session
of Congress there is...

873
01:32:21,791 --> 01:32:25,090
easier for us to enter
the Jedi temple it will be.

874
01:33:03,566 --> 01:33:05,534
R2, stay with the ship.

875
01:33:30,259 --> 01:33:33,990
Welcome, Lord Vader.
We've been expecting you.

876
01:34:05,861 --> 01:34:10,355
And the Jedi rebellion has been foiled.

877
01:34:10,466 --> 01:34:12,764
- What's happened?
- The chancellor's been elaborating...

878
01:34:12,868 --> 01:34:16,167
on a plot by the Jedi
to overthrow the senate.

879
01:34:16,272 --> 01:34:21,733
The remaining Jedi will be
hunted down and defeated.

880
01:34:37,559 --> 01:34:39,993
Not even the younglings
survived.

881
01:34:41,130 --> 01:34:43,064
Killed not by clones...

882
01:34:43,165 --> 01:34:46,396
this Padawan.

883
01:34:47,503 --> 01:34:50,131
By a lightsaber he was.

884
01:34:57,012 --> 01:35:00,573
Who? Who could have
done this?

885
01:35:11,293 --> 01:35:14,490
The attempt on my life...

886
01:35:14,596 --> 01:35:17,224
has left me scarred...

887
01:35:17,333 --> 01:35:20,325
and deformed.

888
01:35:20,436 --> 01:35:23,337
But I assure you.

889
01:35:23,439 --> 01:35:28,138
My resolve
has never been stronger!

890
01:35:32,348 --> 01:35:36,216
Stop! No!

891
01:35:45,861 --> 01:35:49,524
In order to ensure
the security...

892
01:35:49,631 --> 01:35:52,191
and continuing stability...

893
01:35:52,301 --> 01:35:56,203
the Republic
will be reorganized...

894
01:35:56,305 --> 01:36:01,743
into the first
Galactic Empire!

895
01:36:01,844 --> 01:36:03,869
For a safe...

896
01:36:03,979 --> 01:36:08,507
and secure society.

897
01:36:17,926 --> 01:36:20,622
So this is how liberty dies.

898
01:36:20,729 --> 01:36:23,425
With thunderous applause.

899
01:36:25,868 --> 01:36:28,063
The war is over.

900
01:36:28,170 --> 01:36:32,266
Lord Sidious promised us peace.
We only want-

901
01:36:40,416 --> 01:36:45,115
I have recalibrated the code,
warning all surviving Jedi to stay away.

902
01:36:45,220 --> 01:36:47,654
For the clones...

903
01:36:47,756 --> 01:36:51,852
to discover the recalibration
a long time it will take.

904
01:37:04,206 --> 01:37:06,265
Wait. Master.

905
01:37:06,375 --> 01:37:09,538
There is something
I must know.

906
01:37:15,651 --> 01:37:18,119
If into the security
recordings you go...

907
01:37:18,220 --> 01:37:20,120
only pain will you find.

908
01:37:20,222 --> 01:37:23,658
I must know
the truth, Master.

909
01:37:30,566 --> 01:37:32,500
It can't be.

910
01:37:32,601 --> 01:37:34,501
It can't be.

911
01:37:34,603 --> 01:37:38,664
You have done well,
my new apprentice.

912
01:37:38,774 --> 01:37:41,766
Now, Lord Vader...

913
01:37:41,877 --> 01:37:45,404
go and bring peace
to the Empire.

914
01:37:45,514 --> 01:37:47,675
I can't watch any more.

915
01:37:47,783 --> 01:37:52,345
Destroy the Sith we must.

916
01:37:54,156 --> 01:37:56,249
Send me to kill
the emperor.

917
01:37:56,358 --> 01:37:58,656
I will not kill Anakin.

918
01:37:58,760 --> 01:38:03,493
To fight this Lord Sidious,
strong enough you are not.

919
01:38:03,599 --> 01:38:06,830
He is like my brother.
I cannot do it.

920
01:38:06,935 --> 01:38:12,669
Twisted by the dark side
young Skywalker has become.

921
01:38:12,774 --> 01:38:16,175
The boy you trained,
gone he is.

922
01:38:16,278 --> 01:38:19,179
Consumed by Darth Vader.

923
01:38:19,281 --> 01:38:22,273
I do not know where
the emperor has sent him.

924
01:38:22,384 --> 01:38:24,614
I don't know where to look.

925
01:38:25,921 --> 01:38:29,618
Use your feelings, Obi-Wan,
and find him you will.

926
01:38:40,169 --> 01:38:42,763
When was the last time
you saw him?

927
01:38:42,871 --> 01:38:46,238
- Yesterday.
- And do you know where he is now?

928
01:38:47,342 --> 01:38:49,310
No.

929
01:38:49,411 --> 01:38:53,006
Padmé, I need your help.

930
01:38:53,115 --> 01:38:56,107
- He is in grave danger.
- From the Sith?

931
01:38:56,218 --> 01:38:58,186
From himself.

932
01:39:00,622 --> 01:39:02,715
Padmé...

933
01:39:02,824 --> 01:39:05,224
Anakin has turned
to the dark side.

934
01:39:05,327 --> 01:39:08,763
You're wrong.
How could you even say that?

935
01:39:11,567 --> 01:39:15,401
I have seen a-
a security hologram...

936
01:39:15,504 --> 01:39:17,938
of him...

937
01:39:18,040 --> 01:39:19,940
killing younglings.

938
01:39:20,042 --> 01:39:23,068
Not Anakin.
He couldn't.

939
01:39:23,178 --> 01:39:26,147
He was deceived by a lie.
We all were.

940
01:39:26,248 --> 01:39:30,742
It appears that the chancellor
is behind everything, including the war.

941
01:39:32,588 --> 01:39:35,318
Palpatine is the Sith lord
we've been looking for.

942
01:39:35,424 --> 01:39:39,520
After the death of Count Dooku,
Anakin became his new apprentice.

943
01:39:45,734 --> 01:39:47,702
I don't believe you.

944
01:39:49,104 --> 01:39:51,072
I can't.

945
01:39:56,178 --> 01:39:58,669
Padmé...

946
01:39:58,780 --> 01:40:01,044
I must find him.

947
01:40:03,151 --> 01:40:05,517
You're going to kill him,
aren't you?

948
01:40:09,191 --> 01:40:11,682
He has become
a very great threat.

949
01:40:14,296 --> 01:40:16,264
I can't.

950
01:40:29,478 --> 01:40:31,412
Anakin is the father,
isn't he?

951
01:40:35,217 --> 01:40:38,050
I'm so sorry.

952
01:41:23,598 --> 01:41:25,259
Milady, let me come with you.

953
01:41:25,367 --> 01:41:28,131
There's no danger.
The fighting's over. And this is personal.

954
01:41:28,236 --> 01:41:30,636
As you wish, milady,
but I strongly disagree.

955
01:41:30,739 --> 01:41:34,402
I'll be all right, Captain.
This is something I must do myself.

956
01:41:34,509 --> 01:41:36,875
Besides, 3PO will look after me.

957
01:41:38,747 --> 01:41:40,715
Oh, dear.

958
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:53,453
Do you know?

959
01:41:53,562 --> 01:41:57,157
I think I'm beginning to get
the hang of this flying business. Hmm.

960
01:42:24,559 --> 01:42:27,995
The separatists have been
taken care of, my master.

961
01:42:28,096 --> 01:42:30,997
It is finished then.

962
01:42:32,401 --> 01:42:38,203
You have restored
peace and justice to the galaxy.

963
01:42:38,306 --> 01:42:43,209
Send a message to the ships
of the Trade Federation.

964
01:42:43,311 --> 01:42:48,476
All droid units
must shut down immediately.

965
01:42:48,583 --> 01:42:50,642
Very good, my lord.

966
01:43:50,612 --> 01:43:52,671
I saw your ship.

967
01:43:55,517 --> 01:43:58,509
- What are you doing out here?
- I was so worried about you.

968
01:43:59,988 --> 01:44:02,855
Obi-Wan told me
terrible things.

969
01:44:02,958 --> 01:44:05,085
What things?

970
01:44:05,193 --> 01:44:08,128
He said you've turned
to the dark side.

971
01:44:08,230 --> 01:44:10,630
That you...

972
01:44:10,732 --> 01:44:12,859
killed younglings.

973
01:44:14,402 --> 01:44:17,098
Obi-Wan is trying
to turn you against me.

974
01:44:17,205 --> 01:44:20,971
- He cares about us.
- Us?

975
01:44:21,076 --> 01:44:23,806
He knows.

976
01:44:23,912 --> 01:44:25,812
He wants to help you.

977
01:44:28,917 --> 01:44:32,910
Anakin, all I want
is your love.

978
01:44:33,021 --> 01:44:35,353
Love won't save you, Padmé.

979
01:44:35,457 --> 01:44:38,722
- Only my new powers can do that.
- At what cost?

980
01:44:38,827 --> 01:44:41,227
You're a good person.
Don't do this.

981
01:44:41,329 --> 01:44:44,059
I won't lose you the way
I lost my mother.

982
01:44:44,165 --> 01:44:48,397
I am becoming more powerful
than any Jedi has ever dreamed of.

983
01:44:48,503 --> 01:44:51,301
And I'm doing it for you.
To protect you.

984
01:44:52,607 --> 01:44:54,575
Come away with me.

985
01:44:54,676 --> 01:44:57,338
Help me raise our child.

986
01:44:57,445 --> 01:45:01,677
- Leave everything else behind while we still can.
- Don't you see?

987
01:45:01,783 --> 01:45:05,014
We don't have to
run away anymore.

988
01:45:05,120 --> 01:45:07,645
I have brought peace
to the Republic.

989
01:45:07,756 --> 01:45:10,623
I am more powerful
than the chancellor.

990
01:45:10,725 --> 01:45:12,818
I-I can overthrow him.

991
01:45:14,896 --> 01:45:17,956
And together, you and I
can rule the galaxy...

992
01:45:18,066 --> 01:45:20,466
make things the way
we want them to be.

993
01:45:26,808 --> 01:45:28,799
I don't believe
what I'm hearing.

994
01:45:30,312 --> 01:45:33,611
Obi-Wan was right.
You've changed.

995
01:45:35,817 --> 01:45:38,684
I don't want to hear
any more about Obi-Wan.

996
01:45:38,787 --> 01:45:42,951
The Jedi turned against me.
Don't you turn against me.

997
01:45:44,659 --> 01:45:46,650
I don't know you anymore.

998
01:45:48,296 --> 01:45:50,264
Anakin...

999
01:45:50,365 --> 01:45:52,959
you're breaking my heart.

1000
01:45:53,068 --> 01:45:56,037
You're going down a path
I can't follow.

1001
01:45:56,137 --> 01:45:58,901
Because of Obi-Wan?

1002
01:45:59,007 --> 01:46:01,805
Because of what you've done.

1003
01:46:01,910 --> 01:46:03,810
What you plan to do.

1004
01:46:05,046 --> 01:46:07,708
Stop. Stop now.
Come back.

1005
01:46:07,816 --> 01:46:10,751
- I love you.
- Liar!

1006
01:46:13,622 --> 01:46:15,487
No.

1007
01:46:15,590 --> 01:46:19,321
You're with him!
You brought him here to kill me.

1008
01:46:19,427 --> 01:46:22,362
- No.
- Let her go, Anakin.

1009
01:46:23,932 --> 01:46:25,490
Anakin.

1010
01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:27,761
Let her go.

1011
01:46:37,746 --> 01:46:39,771
You turned her against me!

1012
01:46:41,383 --> 01:46:43,578
You have done that yourself.

1013
01:46:48,323 --> 01:46:50,518
You will not
take her from me!

1014
01:46:50,625 --> 01:46:54,459
Your anger and your lust for power
have already done that.

1015
01:46:57,632 --> 01:47:02,763
You have allowed this dark lord
to twist your mind, until now-

1016
01:47:04,339 --> 01:47:07,502
until now you have become
the very thing you swore to destroy.

1017
01:47:07,609 --> 01:47:09,543
Don't lecture me,
Obi-Wan.

1018
01:47:09,644 --> 01:47:12,135
I see through
the lies of the Jedi.

1019
01:47:13,248 --> 01:47:15,648
I do not fear the dark side
as you do.

1020
01:47:17,485 --> 01:47:19,419
I have brought peace...

1021
01:47:19,521 --> 01:47:21,216
freedom, justice...

1022
01:47:21,322 --> 01:47:25,156
and security
to my new empire.

1023
01:47:25,260 --> 01:47:28,127
Your new empire?

1024
01:47:28,229 --> 01:47:31,562
Don't make me kill you.

1025
01:47:31,666 --> 01:47:36,160
Anakin, my allegiance
is to the Republic, to democracy!

1026
01:47:36,271 --> 01:47:38,865
If you're not with me...

1027
01:47:39,908 --> 01:47:41,808
then you're my enemy.

1028
01:47:43,812 --> 01:47:46,303
Only a Sith
deals in absolutes.

1029
01:47:48,917 --> 01:47:51,317
I will do what I must.

1030
01:47:51,419 --> 01:47:53,819
You will try.

1031
01:48:25,587 --> 01:48:29,614
I hear a new apprentice
you have, Emperor.

1032
01:48:29,724 --> 01:48:34,184
Or should I call you
Darth Sidious?

1033
01:48:34,295 --> 01:48:36,525
Master Yoda.

1034
01:48:36,631 --> 01:48:38,690
You survived.

1035
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:41,530
Surprised?

1036
01:48:41,636 --> 01:48:46,232
Your arrogance blinds you,
Master Yoda.

1037
01:48:46,341 --> 01:48:48,400
Now you will experience...

1038
01:48:48,510 --> 01:48:52,970
the full power
of the dark side.

1039
01:49:34,923 --> 01:49:38,620
I have waited a long time...

1040
01:49:38,726 --> 01:49:41,286
for this moment...

1041
01:49:41,396 --> 01:49:45,924
my little green friend.

1042
01:49:54,976 --> 01:49:59,606
At last the Jedi are no more.

1043
01:49:59,714 --> 01:50:03,946
Not if anything to say about it I have.

1044
01:50:04,052 --> 01:50:05,383
Aaah!

1045
01:50:08,556 --> 01:50:11,616
At an end your rule is.

1046
01:50:13,494 --> 01:50:15,928
And not short enough it was.

1047
01:50:19,868 --> 01:50:22,894
If so powerful you are...

1048
01:50:24,172 --> 01:50:26,470
why leave?

1049
01:50:26,574 --> 01:50:29,134
You will not stop me.

1050
01:50:29,244 --> 01:50:33,840
Darth Vader will become
more powerful than either of us.

1051
01:50:33,948 --> 01:50:38,317
Faith in your new apprentice
misplaced may be.

1052
01:50:39,621 --> 01:50:43,682
As is your faith
in the dark side of the Force.

1053
01:55:11,325 --> 01:55:14,055
Hurry. Careful timing
we will need.

1054
01:55:14,162 --> 01:55:16,960
Activate your homing beacon
when you're ready.

1055
01:55:17,064 --> 01:55:19,430
There's no sign
of his body, sir.

1056
01:55:19,534 --> 01:55:23,197
- Then he is not dead.
- Double your search.

1057
01:55:23,304 --> 01:55:25,534
Yes, sir.
Right away, sir.

1058
01:55:25,640 --> 01:55:30,737
Tell Captain Kagi to prepare my shuttle
for immediate takeoff.

1059
01:55:30,845 --> 01:55:35,908
- Yes, Master.
- I sense Lord Vader is in danger.

1060
01:56:44,752 --> 01:56:48,518
Into exile I must go.

1061
01:56:48,623 --> 01:56:50,716
Failed I have.

1062
01:58:30,124 --> 01:58:32,092
I have failed you, Anakin.

1063
01:58:32,193 --> 01:58:34,093
I have failed you.

1064
01:58:34,195 --> 01:58:37,096
I should have known the Jedi
were plotting to take over.

1065
01:58:37,198 --> 01:58:39,996
Anakin, Chancellor Palpatine is evil!

1066
01:58:40,101 --> 01:58:42,763
From my point of view,
the Jedi are evil.

1067
01:58:42,870 --> 01:58:44,428
Well, then you are lost!

1068
01:58:56,317 --> 01:58:58,842
This is the end for you,
my master.

1069
01:59:23,377 --> 01:59:27,473
It's over, Anakin.
I have the high ground.

1070
01:59:29,150 --> 01:59:31,846
You underestimate my power.

1071
01:59:31,952 --> 01:59:34,318
Don't try it.

1072
01:59:56,410 --> 01:59:59,174
You were the chosen one!

1073
02:00:00,681 --> 02:00:03,878
It was said that you would
destroy the Sith, not join them!

1074
02:00:06,520 --> 02:00:08,579
Bring balance
to the Force...

1075
02:00:08,689 --> 02:00:11,214
not leave it in darkness!

1076
02:00:22,002 --> 02:00:24,334
I hate you!

1077
02:00:31,779 --> 02:00:34,043
You were my brother, Anakin.

1078
02:00:36,116 --> 02:00:38,448
I loved you.

1079
02:01:18,325 --> 02:01:20,293
Oh. Master Kenobi.

1080
02:01:20,394 --> 02:01:22,658
Um, we have
Miss Padmé on board.

1081
02:01:22,763 --> 02:01:25,288
Yes. Please,
please hurry.

1082
02:01:25,399 --> 02:01:27,560
We should leave
this dreadful place.

1083
02:01:39,613 --> 02:01:41,581
Obi-Wan.

1084
02:01:43,117 --> 02:01:45,312
Is Anakin all right?

1085
02:02:53,921 --> 02:02:56,719
Your Majesty, this way.

1086
02:02:56,824 --> 02:02:58,724
There he is.

1087
02:02:58,826 --> 02:03:00,987
He's still alive.

1088
02:03:03,998 --> 02:03:06,228
Get a medical capsule
immediately.

1089
02:03:06,333 --> 02:03:08,301
Yes, sir. Right away.

1090
02:03:43,504 --> 02:03:46,200
Excuse me,
Master Yoda.

1091
02:03:52,146 --> 02:03:54,307
Obi-Wan Kenobi
has made contact.

1092
02:04:11,165 --> 02:04:13,565
We'll take her to the medical center.
Quickly.

1093
02:04:43,130 --> 02:04:46,122
Medically,
she's completely healthy.

1094
02:04:46,233 --> 02:04:49,430
For reasons we can't explain,
we are losing her.

1095
02:04:50,804 --> 02:04:53,534
- She's dying?
- We don't know why.

1096
02:04:53,640 --> 02:04:55,699
She has lost
the will to live.

1097
02:04:55,809 --> 02:04:58,972
We need to operate quickly
if we are to save the babies.

1098
02:04:59,079 --> 02:05:00,671
Babies?

1099
02:05:00,781 --> 02:05:02,646
She's carrying twins.

1100
02:05:42,289 --> 02:05:44,723
Ee-see-tah oy-doh.

1101
02:05:44,825 --> 02:05:47,589
Luke.

1102
02:05:54,501 --> 02:05:58,028
Oh, Luke.

1103
02:06:01,608 --> 02:06:05,874
Ooh-bah, ooh-bah.

1104
02:06:05,979 --> 02:06:09,380
Ooh-bah.

1105
02:06:15,389 --> 02:06:18,358
Ee-see-tah oy-dah.

1106
02:06:18,458 --> 02:06:21,393
- It's a girl.
- Leia.

1107
02:07:03,370 --> 02:07:05,998
Obi-Wan?

1108
02:07:10,244 --> 02:07:12,144
There's good in him.

1109
02:07:14,848 --> 02:07:16,782
I know.

1110
02:07:16,884 --> 02:07:19,478
I know there's...

1111
02:07:19,586 --> 02:07:21,554
still-

1112
02:07:55,756 --> 02:07:58,452
Lord Vader.

1113
02:07:58,558 --> 02:08:00,651
Can you hear me?

1114
02:08:03,697 --> 02:08:06,165
Yes, Master.

1115
02:08:08,302 --> 02:08:11,135
Where is Padmé?

1116
02:08:11,238 --> 02:08:13,900
Is she safe?

1117
02:08:15,008 --> 02:08:16,999
Is she all right?

1118
02:08:18,745 --> 02:08:23,273
It seems, in your anger,
you killed her.

1119
02:08:24,318 --> 02:08:27,219
I? I couldn't have.

1120
02:08:27,321 --> 02:08:30,313
She was alive.
I felt it!

1121
02:08:50,110 --> 02:08:54,410
No!

1122
02:09:04,291 --> 02:09:08,921
Hidden, safe
the children must be kept.

1123
02:09:09,029 --> 02:09:13,261
We must take them somewhere
where the Sith will not sense their presence.

1124
02:09:14,368 --> 02:09:18,304
Hmm. Split up
they should be.

1125
02:09:18,405 --> 02:09:20,532
My wife and I
will take the girl.

1126
02:09:22,109 --> 02:09:25,044
We've always talked
of adopting a baby girl.

1127
02:09:25,145 --> 02:09:27,375
She will be loved with us.

1128
02:09:27,481 --> 02:09:30,279
And what of the boy?

1129
02:09:30,384 --> 02:09:34,718
To Tatooine.
To his family send him.

1130
02:09:36,556 --> 02:09:38,990
I will take the child
and watch over him.

1131
02:09:43,697 --> 02:09:48,134
Until the time is right,
disappear we will.

1132
02:09:49,936 --> 02:09:53,531
Master Kenobi,
wait a moment.

1133
02:09:55,075 --> 02:10:00,274
In your solitude on Tatooine,
training I have for you.

1134
02:10:00,380 --> 02:10:02,940
Training?

1135
02:10:03,050 --> 02:10:07,612
An old friend has learned
the path to immortality.

1136
02:10:09,689 --> 02:10:12,783
One who has returned from
the netherworld of the Force.

1137
02:10:12,893 --> 02:10:15,384
Your old master.

1138
02:10:15,495 --> 02:10:17,486
Qui-Gon?

1139
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:23,265
How to commune with him
I will teach you.

1140
02:10:24,771 --> 02:10:26,932
- Captain Antilles.
- Yes, Your Highness?

1141
02:10:27,040 --> 02:10:28,940
I'm placing these droids
in your care.

1142
02:10:29,042 --> 02:10:30,942
Treat them well.
Clean them up.

1143
02:10:31,044 --> 02:10:32,944
Have the protocol droid's
mind wiped.

1144
02:10:33,046 --> 02:10:34,513
What?

1145
02:10:36,383 --> 02:10:38,351
Oh, no.
