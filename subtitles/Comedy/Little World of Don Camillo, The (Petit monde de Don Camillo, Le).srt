1
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:32,407
Children, all of you: sit or stand up straight!

2
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:36,995
This way! Look at the camera!

3
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:40,082
Children! Come on!

4
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,836
Children, turn forward and stand still, if you please!

5
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:47,506
This way! Straight! The two of you who are fighting......

6
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:53,679
At school our teacher gave us a funny essay topic...

7
00:00:55,889 --> 00:01:01,270
"What do you want to be when you grow up?"

8
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:12,656
Come on, Nicolas, it is not difficult.

9
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:16,451
It's difficult, if you don't know what you want to be.

10
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,829
The others knew...

11
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:24,126
Alceste, for example, wants to be a minister...

12
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:27,713
Alceste is my best friend. He's a fatty who's always eating.

13
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:32,676
That is blood sausage, this is thymus,
those are kidneys...

14
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,888
And that is liver pate.
That seems yucky, but it's really tasty.

15
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:39,266
Why does he want to be minister?

16
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:43,478
Because you often get to go to banquets.

17
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:54,281
On Christmas Eve we're having Grandma,
Aunt Dorothe, and Uncle Eugene.

18
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:58,744
We're having liverwurst, stuffed turkey, and chestnuts.

19
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:03,874
Geoffroy will be working with his father.

20
00:02:12,508 --> 00:02:15,719
Geoffroy lives in a large house, with a huge garden.

21
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,641
He even has a swimming pool in the form of an onion.

22
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:27,022
Geoffroy's Pop is very rich, and buys him whatever he wants.

23
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:31,193
You should not get involved with Geoffroy while he's dressing.

24
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:43,038
Because his father is rich,
Albert the gardener brings him to school.

25
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,502
That's Clotaire. He loves bikes.

26
00:02:51,547 --> 00:02:54,633
It is an ultra fast racing bike!

27
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:02,140
~ Why's it got saddlebags?
~ For quick errands.

28
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:09,898
Clotaire wants to be a champion bike-rider.

29
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:18,740
~ Clotaire, what did I just say?
~ Clotaire is the class dunce.

30
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:24,037
~ Scaffold?
~ What is a scaffold?

31
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:28,292
Something for them to shave wood?

32
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,337
Go into the corner.

33
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:38,135
He always gets everything upside down.

34
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:44,892
Thanks to his report card he can't watch TV anymore,...

35
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,269
and he gets no dessert.

36
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:52,566
The Director tells him this:

37
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:56,653
Your parents have a good education...why not you?

38
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:02,492
The report card ceremony is hardly fun for anyone.

39
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:07,414
Nicolas: "Often distracted, could do better."

40
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:10,292
The only one who doesn't care is Eudes.

41
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:14,922
Eudes: "Bully in the classroom and in the playground,...

42
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,715
"with adequate grades."

43
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:23,388
My father never says anything. You know why not?

44
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,016
I look him straight in the eye.

45
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:31,355
Then he looks at the report card, and says nothing.

46
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:40,572
What an awful report card! No dessert tonight!

47
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:44,701
Given his father's eyes, the trick isn't likely.

48
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,788
Eudes says he wants to be a bandit.

49
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,083
But that's not a job, bandit?

50
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:54,461
Sure it is! If there were no crooks,
there were no policemen.

51
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,214
And then your father would be out of a job,
and you'd live in a shack.

52
00:04:57,464 --> 00:05:00,008
~ What did you say?
~ I said, in a shack!

53
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:04,388
Rufus wants to be a policeman, like his father.

54
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:11,395
But when it comes to mischief, he's the best!

55
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,398
Guys, look, who am I?

56
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,277
~ Frankenstein?
~ Dracula?

57
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:20,612
~ The Phantom of the Louvre?
~ A werewolf?

58
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,117
No, guys! It is Mr. Bouillon!

59
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,623
Mr. Bouillon, the playground guard.

60
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:35,586
We call him that because he always says: "Look into my eyes."

61
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:38,297
Bouillon soup and staring eyes.

62
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:41,717
I don't actually understand it myself, but the big guys have told me.

63
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,804
He loves to give lines.

64
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,265
Write 100 times: "I can not stab the dragon,...

65
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:50,601
"with the invigilator, in such a grotesque way,...

66
00:05:50,893 --> 00:05:53,353
"that definitely is  not the reality upon which the object is based."

67
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,316
He's never bothered Agnan.

68
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:01,445
Agnan is the best in the class, and the teacher's pet.

69
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:03,906
But his specialty is as a dirty snitch.

70
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:06,491
Miss, Miss! They're talking.

71
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:11,663
We can hate him, but we can't beat him up...

72
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,665
because he wears glasses.

73
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:19,254
Agnan doesn't know what he wants to do.

74
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,131
Miss, he's trying to copy!

75
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:27,846
At my age, my dad knew what he wanted to be.

76
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:31,934
He often says that if he weren't married to Mom,...

77
00:06:32,643 --> 00:06:35,312
then he would have been a star footballer.

78
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:43,987
Or maybe a swimming champion.

79
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:55,040
~ Or:...
~ Cycling champion.

80
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:58,961
A Gossip-champion, you could be sure. World-class, even.

81
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:00,838
That's Mr. Blediole, our neighbor.

82
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:04,341
Have you nothing better to do than eavesdrop?

83
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:07,928
I listen without prejudice, I enjoy it. Just like the rest of the neighborhood.

84
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,098
~ You've been warned.
~ Why, what you gonna do?

85
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:13,433
He and Daddy really like bickering.

86
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:15,853
He's a champion gossiper at the drop of a hat?

87
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:22,901
And then there's Mom...

88
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:29,992
My mother always wanted to be just a mother.

89
00:07:30,868 --> 00:07:34,371
I think they have everything they want.

90
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:41,587
I do not know why I would want anything different later...

91
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:45,048
because my life is now just super-fantastic.

92
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:48,051
I definitely would not want that to change.

93
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,763
Who can me tell the story of Tom Thumb?

94
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,933
~ Eudes?
~ ...He was small?

95
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:42,684
Yes, OK. But more?

96
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:48,190
~ Rufus?
~ He's small enough to break into places easily?

97
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,859
Not quite.

98
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:58,784
~ Alceste?
~ He's small because he doesn't eat enough.

99
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,579
~ Not quite.
~ Miss, Miss, Miss!

100
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,167
Nicolas?

101
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:13,340
~ Miss, Miss!
~ Well, go ahead, Agnan.

102
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:18,929
He was called Tom Thumb, Tom Thumb,
because he was as small as a thumb.

103
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:21,890
He was the youngest son of a poor woodcutter family.

104
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:27,229
His parents decided that they were too poor to keep their kids and left them in the forest.

105
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:28,939
Then...

106
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:48,834
Joaquim! Congratulations!

107
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,563
News Flash: Joaquim has a new brother!

108
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:10,981
Silence!

109
00:12:18,322 --> 00:12:19,948
Clotaire, what are you doing?

110
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:30,167
I was having a nice sleep. Then my dad woke me up.

111
00:12:31,043 --> 00:12:37,508
He had dressed quickly, and hadn't shaved --- then he said I had a brother!

112
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:38,675
And then?

113
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,345
Then my father brought me to my mother.

114
00:12:41,345 --> 00:12:44,598
She lay in a hospital bed, and was as happy as my dad.

115
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:48,352
And beside her...sigh...My brother.

116
00:12:50,354 --> 00:12:53,023
~ And you aren't happy?
~ Why should I be?

117
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:55,901
He screams all day, which my father says is cute.

118
00:12:56,235 --> 00:12:59,738
But when I try it, he slaps me on the head.

119
00:13:00,531 --> 00:13:03,408
Just get near the cradle, and I get another one to the head.

120
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,371
~ How big is the baby?
~ Maybe so big...

121
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,456
Pretty soon he'll be up to here.

122
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,167
Yes, and then you'll have to share your room with him!

123
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:14,336
Never! It's MY room!

124
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:16,588
~ Well, he could still sleep in the garden?
~ We don't have one.

125
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,843
~ Then make a garden?
~ Or in the garage?

126
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:24,471
This is the pits. I wanted a bike, not a brother.

127
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:26,890
You're doomed. He'll eat up all your candy.

128
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,017
And you can't complain, because they'll think you're jealous.

129
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:33,397
Yeah, exactly, they say you're jealous and you get your head bashed.

130
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:39,945
~Before you know it, you'll be sleeping in the garage.
~ I tell you, you're doomed.

131
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:46,285
~ But did they say anything, though?
~ No.

132
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:49,621
~ Although, my father was acting strange lately.

133
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:53,834
~ How?
~ He was super-kind to my mother.

134
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:58,046
For example, he carried a lot of heavy shopping.

135
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:01,508
And then he said: "No, honey, don't tire yourself out."

136
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:07,472
He even took out the trash without grumbling. Weird.

137
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:13,729
~ Mama?
~ Yes, darling?

138
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:15,606
How are babies made?

139
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:22,446
~ Ah, look, your father's home!
~ Surprise!

140
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:33,332
"For Nicolas, son of a hard working father.

141
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:35,459
"Signed: Roger Moucheboume."

142
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,879
Mr. Moucheboume is Daddy's boss.

143
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:41,381
Sir, have you already read the letter I had placed on your desk?

144
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:42,257
What letter?

145
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:46,011
That letter about my salary increase. I thought since we last discussed...

146
00:14:46,345 --> 00:14:48,931
This can wait. Besides, I have a job for you.

147
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:51,975
My parents often fight over his job.

148
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:54,102
He exploits you, and you do nothing about it!

149
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:57,689
OK, I'll hand in my resignation! Nicolas, pack your suitcase.

150
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,316
We'll live in a caravan.

151
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:01,568
Super! I'm packing...

152
00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:04,988
Dad and Mom often argue anyway.

153
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:11,370
~ What have you brought home?
~ A trifle, really. It was a bargain.

154
00:15:11,662 --> 00:15:14,790
Where will we put it? Anyhow, we'll soon truly poor, is that what you want?

155
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,959
We'll find somewhere. Maybe that round table?

156
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,710
But I thought Mr. Moucheboume had said...

157
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:21,922
It's not certain. So where do you want this?

158
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:23,799
It's not certain? We can’t really pay for a TV,

159
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:25,342
The car isn't even paid off yet.

160
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:28,220
Should I bring it back? What do you want me to do?

161
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:31,348
Boil me in oil, but I can't stand this!

162
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:33,851
But eventually they always cooperate.

163
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:36,353
Well...Put it over there.

164
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:47,739
Well, almost always...

165
00:15:52,244 --> 00:15:53,912
~ Nicolas?
~ Yes?

166
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:56,665
~ Don't ever get married.
~ OK.

167
00:16:01,712 --> 00:16:04,464
Nicolas, maybe you should write a letter,...

168
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:06,508
a thank-you note to Mr. Moucheboume.

169
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:09,052
Dear sir... no...Moucheboume Dear sir,

170
00:16:09,428 --> 00:16:14,558
No... Dear Mr. Moucheboume...Wait...Dearest?

171
00:16:15,184 --> 00:16:17,895
Dear, Dear or Dear Mr. Moucheboume?

172
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,355
I hear nothing while I'm in the kitchen.

173
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:22,858
Dear, Dear or Dear Mr. Moucheboume?

174
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:26,570
~ Dear Mr. Moucheboume.
~ No, that is too conventional.

175
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:29,448
If you know things that well, why ask me then?

176
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:35,120
Well then...Moucheboume Dear Sir, Space...

177
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:38,665
I was very surprised by your surprise...no.

178
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:44,505
I was very pleased with your happy...no, surprise. I was surprised by your impressive...no.

179
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:46,924
I was pleasantly surprised by your huge surprise...

180
00:16:46,924 --> 00:16:49,635
Oh, yes...make it gargantuan.

181
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:54,097
Well...the big surprise...your beautiful gift received...

182
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:56,517
~ Your...
~ Super-gift?

183
00:16:56,517 --> 00:16:58,268
No...your wonderful gift.

184
00:16:58,602 --> 00:17:00,938
The kid is right, "super" sounds much more sincere...

185
00:17:00,938 --> 00:17:03,941
How can we write if you keep interrupting us?

186
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:07,444
Well, your beautiful gift, the following sentence.

187
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:12,866
Sincerely Yours...no.

188
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:19,373
Sincerely, or Yours?

189
00:17:22,376 --> 00:17:29,383
Write it...my love...and ready. Give me.

190
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:44,898
Nicolas, please.

191
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:52,406
Nicolas!

192
00:17:58,662 --> 00:18:00,706
Stop that God-forsaken thing!

193
00:18:24,313 --> 00:18:26,190
So I never get that better job.

194
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:36,617
Maybe if we ask the Moucheboumes over for dinner?

195
00:18:53,217 --> 00:18:56,595
"He even took out the trash without grumbling."

196
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:38,762
~ No, Honey, I'll go...
~ How sweet of you.

197
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:44,810
~ Where are the cups?
~ Oh wait, I'll get them.

198
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:49,147
~ No problem, relax.
~ Oh, let me do it.

199
00:19:58,156 --> 00:19:59,616
~ I'm getting a little brother!
~ Where?

200
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:02,536
No idea, but it went exactly as Joaquim said!

201
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,290
Where is Joaquim, anyway?

202
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,585
Children.

203
00:20:15,883 --> 00:20:18,719
No lessons today, the school doctor is here for your checkups.

204
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:23,223
Miss, Joaquim isn't here yet.

205
00:20:23,557 --> 00:20:25,267
I already know, his parents called.

206
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:27,811
Follow me in silence.

207
00:20:29,438 --> 00:20:32,733
~ Strange about Joaquim.
~ Maybe it's his brother!

208
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:35,903
Maybe his parents left him in the woods,...

209
00:20:35,903 --> 00:20:37,654
like Tom Thumb!

210
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:46,079
~ Did it hurt?
~ A super lot of pain.

211
00:20:46,455 --> 00:20:48,707
So bad they had to tie us down.

212
00:20:50,626 --> 00:20:52,794
I don't want to! Mama!

213
00:20:53,295 --> 00:20:56,298
What is going on? Calm down.

214
00:20:58,675 --> 00:21:02,638
If you're good at the doctor, then I'll call on you more often.

215
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:08,018
~ Even during recess?
~ Yes. ~ Yes!

216
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:14,691
Come on, let's go.

217
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:36,421
I'm going to show you pictures, and you say what you think of.

218
00:21:37,506 --> 00:21:38,257
Ready?

219
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:40,801
What do you see?

220
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:43,345
My father's car.

221
00:21:46,515 --> 00:21:47,724
My father's boat.

222
00:21:51,979 --> 00:21:53,605
My father's airplane.

223
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:54,857
Cough again.

224
00:21:55,274 --> 00:21:55,941
Fine.

225
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:00,320
~ Cough again?
~ That's fine.

226
00:22:01,572 --> 00:22:03,156
Cough again?

227
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:09,288
Go ahead.

228
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,167
I do not know how, I haven't studied for this.

229
00:22:13,917 --> 00:22:15,878
Say just what you think.

230
00:22:17,296 --> 00:22:19,173
It looks like a date.

231
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:22,467
A date. You see a date?

232
00:22:23,135 --> 00:22:28,432
~ I don't know.
~ A date.

233
00:22:31,727 --> 00:22:36,273
~ That wasn't me.
~ Not you. OK.

234
00:22:40,235 --> 00:22:42,529
And this?

235
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:47,618
~ That's not fair, I didn't draw these.

236
00:22:50,204 --> 00:22:52,289
Take your glasses off and tell me what you see.

237
00:22:56,043 --> 00:22:57,961
Take your glasses off, I said.

238
00:23:00,464 --> 00:23:05,427
~ And this? Something from your father?
~ No, this is my mom's fur coat...

239
00:23:06,512 --> 00:23:08,222
the fur coat my father bought.

240
00:23:10,182 --> 00:23:13,685
Next. No, no bread.

241
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:22,986
It's a boy who finds a bean.

242
00:23:23,487 --> 00:23:29,618
He plants it but it grows into a baby,...

243
00:23:30,244 --> 00:23:32,955
getting bigger and bigger...

244
00:23:33,664 --> 00:23:36,333
and finally it's giant, that the boy attacks.

245
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,460
He kills it and eats it.

246
00:23:47,803 --> 00:23:51,390
So I said: Why not come over for a cozy dinner...

247
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:53,392
together with Mrs. Moucheboume?

248
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:57,604
~ And what did he say?
~ He thought it's great. I consult with you and we pick a date!

249
00:23:57,604 --> 00:24:00,983
I'm so happy, honey! But tell me,...

250
00:24:01,525 --> 00:24:03,652
what kind of woman is Mrs. Moucheboume?

251
00:24:04,361 --> 00:24:06,446
No idea, a boss's wife, that sort of thing I guess?

252
00:24:06,822 --> 00:24:10,701
~ But she is very cultivated, or...
~ No idea, we've never met.

253
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:20,752
~ Anyway, if they come, then everything must be perfect!
~  Of course.

254
00:24:21,044 --> 00:24:25,507
And what about Nicolas? He stays here?

255
00:24:26,008 --> 00:24:31,722
~ No, that's impossible.
~ I'm afraid you're right.

256
00:24:45,277 --> 00:24:51,867
~ Nicolas, won't you eat? To grow up big and strong!

257
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:57,331
And next weekend, if we agree, how about a nice walk in the woods?

258
00:25:08,425 --> 00:25:10,093
You've got to get a handle on this.

259
00:25:11,011 --> 00:25:13,222
Exactly, you just give a gift to your mother.

260
00:25:13,222 --> 00:25:15,766
A ham for example.

261
00:25:16,308 --> 00:25:19,144
Then she'll see that you're good, and she won't leave you.

262
00:25:20,062 --> 00:25:22,606
No, you have to buy her a ring! My dad always does.

263
00:25:22,898 --> 00:25:25,317
That always works.

264
00:25:25,943 --> 00:25:28,153
I have only 3 francs.

265
00:25:33,242 --> 00:25:35,202
Hello. Can I help you?

266
00:25:35,494 --> 00:25:37,538
Hi, I would like to buy some flowers for my mother.

267
00:25:37,913 --> 00:25:39,790
How sweet! She's lucky, your mother.

268
00:25:40,123 --> 00:25:42,209
Then they won't leave him in the woods.

269
00:25:45,045 --> 00:25:46,964
~ How much are those roses there?
~ 3 francs.

270
00:25:47,172 --> 00:25:49,883
Super, I'll take that!

271
00:25:52,845 --> 00:25:54,513
No --- 3 francs per flower.

272
00:25:56,473 --> 00:25:59,101
Can I borrow some money, I'll pay you back.

273
00:25:59,434 --> 00:26:01,645
I'm sorry, I've just got enough for my lunch.

274
00:26:02,145 --> 00:26:03,272
~ How about you?
~ I don't have any.

275
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:06,733
~ Why, you still have your pocket money, right?
~ Yeah, so? That's my money!

276
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:08,777
~ Some friends!
~ It's for your mother!

277
00:26:08,777 --> 00:26:11,613
If I wasn't holding these flowers, I'd clobber you!

278
00:26:11,905 --> 00:26:12,531
Calm down, kids!

279
00:26:12,781 --> 00:26:15,826
~ I'm keeping them down here.
~ Here, take this!

280
00:26:22,499 --> 00:26:23,792
Murderer!

281
00:27:12,341 --> 00:27:14,551
What a beautiful rose, Darling!

282
00:27:17,387 --> 00:27:20,140
Clotaire was right. The tactic had worked nicely.

283
00:27:20,807 --> 00:27:23,644
Over the next few days, I did everything I could to please Mom.

284
00:27:24,895 --> 00:27:27,439
I even wore my itchy blue suit...

285
00:27:28,482 --> 00:27:32,945
to go along with Mom for dinner at Mrs. Court-Plaque's.

286
00:27:34,404 --> 00:27:39,868
~ And he's so handsome!
~ Here's a kiss.

287
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:42,329
Ah, there's Marie-Edwige!

288
00:27:48,752 --> 00:27:54,716
This is Marie-Edwige. Quite attractive, but she's a girl, so she's not so interesting.

289
00:27:58,554 --> 00:28:00,681
Show Nicolas your room!

290
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,518
What'll we play?

291
00:28:07,354 --> 00:28:08,856
We could play "nursing sister".

292
00:28:09,231 --> 00:28:15,153
It is wartime, and you're injured and frightened. I take care of you.

293
00:28:17,281 --> 00:28:18,782
I'd rather play cards.

294
00:28:20,117 --> 00:28:23,287
~ OK, what can you play?
~ War?

295
00:28:24,371 --> 00:28:25,622
I know a better game.

296
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:29,585
It was very complicated., Marie-Edwige won the game.

297
00:28:30,377 --> 00:28:32,754
She always had good cards because she took mine.

298
00:28:33,046 --> 00:28:35,549
Now she had them...

299
00:28:36,842 --> 00:28:38,385
and I did not.

300
00:28:41,388 --> 00:28:43,891
Even the cards had a different value.

301
00:28:45,475 --> 00:28:48,228
So she took a my king with a 3.

302
00:28:48,645 --> 00:28:49,897
~ But...
~ What?

303
00:28:50,939 --> 00:28:52,357
And then there were the tricks...

304
00:28:54,943 --> 00:28:56,486
And I always lost.

305
00:28:57,779 --> 00:28:59,698
~ It's sticky.
~ Quit squirming!

306
00:29:03,368 --> 00:29:05,579
Later on the girlfriends
of Marie-Edwige dropped by.

307
00:29:10,918 --> 00:29:12,961
And we played fine.

308
00:29:23,722 --> 00:29:24,973
But after a while...

309
00:29:28,268 --> 00:29:31,021
Maybe I could change schools.

310
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:39,238
~ Good bye, Nicolas!
~ Bye, Nicolas!

311
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,703
That was a nice day.

312
00:29:47,746 --> 00:29:50,749
Good bye, Marie-Edwige, I had a good time.

313
00:29:50,749 --> 00:29:53,335
I think you're very cute, and hope to see you again soon.

314
00:29:54,837 --> 00:29:57,464
But I finally said...

315
00:30:06,265 --> 00:30:09,476
~ I am very proud of you, Nicolas!
~ Mom was very happy...

316
00:30:12,062 --> 00:30:13,897
But all the effort was for nothing.

317
00:30:14,273 --> 00:30:17,442
Tomorrow...we were walking in the woods!

318
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:02,070
Nicolas, what are you doing? Come on, open up.

319
00:31:06,492 --> 00:31:10,120
Get with it! Ha-ha, very funny...now open up!

320
00:31:11,955 --> 00:31:13,457
Open the door immediately!

321
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,127
This is unacceptable! You open that door now!

322
00:31:17,628 --> 00:31:22,216
What are you afraid of? I'm your Mom!

323
00:31:22,591 --> 00:31:23,592
Open up.

324
00:31:25,135 --> 00:31:28,847
And how are we going home, if you don't open the doors?

325
00:31:56,542 --> 00:32:00,003
The rest of the afternoon Mom and Dad were fighting.

326
00:32:04,716 --> 00:32:07,636
I really didn't want to leave my mom.

327
00:32:09,012 --> 00:32:11,682
But I knew that Daddy would eventually win her over.

328
00:32:15,978 --> 00:32:18,689
We're setting up a secret group to help Nicolas.

329
00:32:19,356 --> 00:32:20,232
What's a secret group?

330
00:32:20,691 --> 00:32:22,568
We're heroes who come together to help people.

331
00:32:22,943 --> 00:32:25,445
And our group is called: "El Cid - Children"!

332
00:32:26,363 --> 00:32:27,489
The we have to have a place to hang out.

333
00:32:27,781 --> 00:32:29,616
Good idea, but we also need a password.

334
00:32:30,367 --> 00:32:31,493
"Undaunted Courage"!

335
00:32:32,369 --> 00:32:34,872
Only those who know the password can enter.

336
00:32:36,456 --> 00:32:39,293
Children, time to line up!

337
00:32:46,758 --> 00:32:49,052
Here's a note from my parents.

338
00:32:52,055 --> 00:32:55,350
"Excuse our son Clotaire for not finishing his homework."

339
00:32:57,102 --> 00:32:58,353
Who wrote this?

340
00:33:00,063 --> 00:33:01,148
"Daddy"

341
00:33:16,121 --> 00:33:17,331
~ Excuse me, Miss?
~ Yes?

342
00:33:17,581 --> 00:33:19,917
If we can't see the apple, can we stand up?

343
00:33:20,125 --> 00:33:20,751
Of course.

344
00:33:21,418 --> 00:33:22,920
Sit!

345
00:33:25,589 --> 00:33:26,882
Stand up!

346
00:33:27,341 --> 00:33:28,300
Sit down.

347
00:33:29,468 --> 00:33:32,846
Children, I can tell you with joy,...

348
00:33:32,846 --> 00:33:35,474
that the Minister of Education is coming to visit our school.

349
00:33:36,183 --> 00:33:42,814
I trust you will give him a memorable reception.

350
00:33:43,398 --> 00:33:45,192
And I invite your teacher,...

351
00:33:45,692 --> 00:33:47,444
who will craft a display with you...

352
00:33:48,237 --> 00:33:53,075
of a spectacle, in which culture and education go together.

353
00:33:53,826 --> 00:33:56,912
It will make a deep impression.

354
00:33:58,121 --> 00:34:01,250
But our teacher was not so very pleased with a spectacle.

355
00:34:01,792 --> 00:34:06,213
She already tried something already with us: a play.

356
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:17,391
But Geoffroy, what the hell is that costume for?

357
00:34:18,851 --> 00:34:19,768
A close-order drill.

358
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:28,694
Alright...but what are you doing, away?

359
00:34:28,944 --> 00:34:31,613
Pay attention! And left and right and left...

360
00:34:32,447 --> 00:34:35,826
Bunch of amateurs! Are you the pride of France?

361
00:34:39,163 --> 00:34:47,504
And even a choir...But it was beyond us.

362
00:34:49,173 --> 00:34:51,425
Sorry, that's all I can do.

363
00:34:53,051 --> 00:34:57,222
It may well slow down the curriculum.

364
00:34:59,141 --> 00:35:05,606
~ Someone could recite a poem?
~ Very well.

365
00:35:06,732 --> 00:35:09,151
~ "The Raven and the Fox" or something.
~ Yes, fine.

366
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:16,283
You, little friend, can you recite for me "The Raven and the Fox"?

367
00:35:16,867 --> 00:35:17,910
I do not know it by heart,...

368
00:35:18,285 --> 00:35:20,996
but it was a raven with blue cheese in its mouth.

369
00:35:21,455 --> 00:35:22,706
No, really it was Camembert!

370
00:35:22,998 --> 00:35:27,002
Not, Camembert melts in your mouth out, and it's totally yucky!

371
00:35:30,756 --> 00:35:36,094
Enough, enough! Everyone quiet down!

372
00:35:38,263 --> 00:35:40,599
Go on drawing.

373
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:02,913
~ Password:
~ "Undaunted Courage".

374
00:36:05,457 --> 00:36:07,584
~ Password:
~ "Undaunted Courage".

375
00:36:09,545 --> 00:36:11,213
"Undaunted Courage".

376
00:36:13,006 --> 00:36:14,299
"Undaunted Courage".

377
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:21,306
~ Password:
~ "Terrible Courage"?

378
00:36:22,307 --> 00:36:23,684
Password, or you can't enter.

379
00:36:24,184 --> 00:36:25,018
"Many Courage"?

380
00:36:27,062 --> 00:36:28,188
"Super Courage"?

381
00:36:29,231 --> 00:36:32,401
Well, first we need a boss. That's me.

382
00:36:32,401 --> 00:36:35,821
~ And why you?
~ Because I'm a natural leader.

383
00:36:35,821 --> 00:36:39,658
~ The strongest is the Boss!
~ No, the oldest is the Boss...so it's me.

384
00:36:39,658 --> 00:36:41,952
No, Clotaire's the oldest, he was left back.

385
00:36:42,286 --> 00:36:45,497
We didn't come here to fight.

386
00:36:45,497 --> 00:36:46,707
We can do that at school.

387
00:36:49,668 --> 00:36:52,504
Hello? Just a moment, I'll check...

388
00:36:53,297 --> 00:36:58,552
Sir? The Minister --- he wants an appointment with you.

389
00:37:00,262 --> 00:37:03,557
~ Here, see for yourself here in the agenda.
~ Very well, sir.

390
00:37:06,476 --> 00:37:09,313
~ Your shirts are ready, Sir.
~ Thank you, lay them down.

391
00:37:10,564 --> 00:37:12,900
I also polished your shoes.

392
00:37:20,782 --> 00:37:23,285
~ Do you hear what I say?
~ Huh?

393
00:37:23,785 --> 00:37:25,454
I said I changed my mind.

394
00:37:25,996 --> 00:37:28,332
I don't want to have dinner with the Moucheboumes after all.

395
00:37:28,332 --> 00:37:29,500
What? Why not?

396
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:33,921
Because I have no dress, no jewelry, and I can't drive.

397
00:37:38,717 --> 00:37:40,427
Honey, what do you mean?

398
00:37:40,636 --> 00:37:43,305
I don't want to look like a boring housewife in front of Mrs. Moucheboume.

399
00:37:49,353 --> 00:37:51,980
What's boring?

400
00:37:52,231 --> 00:37:54,775
Do you think her husband stops Mrs. Moucheboume from driving?

401
00:37:55,108 --> 00:37:57,444
No! Do you think she takes the bus? Absolutely not!

402
00:37:57,694 --> 00:38:00,030
~ So she can drive but I can't?.
~ Seems logical.

403
00:38:01,073 --> 00:38:04,284
Do you think Madame Moucheboume doesn't have a nice dress to go out?

404
00:38:04,701 --> 00:38:07,621
~ Of course she does.
~ But I don't.

405
00:38:07,621 --> 00:38:10,374
~ How about that mint-green dress I bought for you, then...

406
00:38:10,374 --> 00:38:13,293
~ I can't wear that old thing every time!
~ You don't.

407
00:38:14,002 --> 00:38:15,462
She does pretty often, though.

408
00:38:16,713 --> 00:38:19,800
Do you think Mrs. Moucheboume is only concerned with only her family, her home?

409
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,677
No, she's a modern woman.

410
00:38:22,177 --> 00:38:26,139
Classy, independent, and I'm only a hausfrau.

411
00:38:26,431 --> 00:38:29,726
All I can do is cook, I am not going to humiliate myself for the entire evening.

412
00:38:30,853 --> 00:38:31,937
So let's cancel the dinner.

413
00:38:35,107 --> 00:38:39,862
Well, then. I do not want my wife to feel humiliated.

414
00:38:40,404 --> 00:38:42,656
Tomorrow we'll go buy a dress at Galerie Lafayette.

415
00:38:43,323 --> 00:38:45,701
~ With jewelry?
~ With jewels.

416
00:38:46,368 --> 00:38:50,164
~ And driving lessons?
~ That, too.

417
00:38:54,168 --> 00:38:56,545
How expensive can it be?

418
00:38:59,715 --> 00:39:06,346
~ "Courage... " Well?
~ "Inflamed"!

419
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:12,769
So, everyone is the Boss of his own group.

420
00:39:13,312 --> 00:39:19,568
For example: Geoffroy is the boss for Eudes, Rufus, and Alceste and me.

421
00:39:19,902 --> 00:39:23,906
Rufus is the boss of Eudes, Clotaire, and me...

422
00:39:24,198 --> 00:39:28,035
Eudes was the boss of Geoffroy,
Rufus, me, and Alceste.

423
00:39:28,368 --> 00:39:31,663
And I have you all in my group. Agreed?

424
00:39:34,166 --> 00:39:36,502
~ Yes.
~ OK, now what?

425
00:39:40,297 --> 00:39:41,757
Eureka, I know!

426
00:39:42,049 --> 00:39:48,847
We'll clean your house. Your parents will be so happy that they'll love you.

427
00:39:49,139 --> 00:39:50,641
So be nice, Nicolas.

428
00:39:51,558 --> 00:39:54,102
We'll be back in about two hours if your mother cooperates.

429
00:39:54,728 --> 00:39:57,189
Why did you say that? "If your mother cooperates?"

430
00:39:57,189 --> 00:40:03,111
~ Simply that I do not know.
~ Well, then just say that.

431
00:40:12,412 --> 00:40:13,580
We have two hours.

432
00:41:36,121 --> 00:41:37,915
~ Accelerator...
~ Stop it!

433
00:41:38,165 --> 00:41:39,666
I'm doing my best!

434
00:41:44,087 --> 00:41:45,005
Brake!

435
00:41:55,682 --> 00:41:59,394
Now what? Don't give up too soon.

436
00:42:05,567 --> 00:42:11,573
I was very curious how my parents would find the house...

437
00:42:13,575 --> 00:42:15,869
OK, the first time was not all...

438
00:42:41,645 --> 00:42:44,648
I would never succeed in making them like me.

439
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,944
So I decided to run away from home.

440
00:42:51,864 --> 00:42:54,575
I took everything I thought I'd need.

441
00:42:55,826 --> 00:42:57,369
So I went on the road.

442
00:43:01,748 --> 00:43:05,377
I wanted to go far away,
far away to China or someplace.

443
00:43:08,255 --> 00:43:12,467
Mom and Dad would miss me.
and I would just return,...

444
00:43:12,467 --> 00:43:17,514
if I was captain of a warship, and could earn lots of money.

445
00:43:19,224 --> 00:43:21,310
With my money, I'd take them to the cinema,...

446
00:43:21,768 --> 00:43:23,854
and everyone would say: Look! It's Nicolas!

447
00:43:24,062 --> 00:43:27,524
He has heaps of money and even pays for the cinema for his parents...

448
00:43:28,192 --> 00:43:30,944
even though they don't much care for him!

449
00:43:49,463 --> 00:43:50,839
So you gave up?

450
00:43:51,131 --> 00:43:52,341
No, I've been thinking.

451
00:43:53,967 --> 00:43:55,594
I'm not the one who should leave.

452
00:43:56,094 --> 00:43:57,638
After all, I was here first.

453
00:43:58,263 --> 00:43:59,723
The person who's got to go is the baby.

454
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:01,808
So if the baby shows up...

455
00:44:03,185 --> 00:44:04,353
we get rid of it.

456
00:44:07,481 --> 00:44:08,315
How?

457
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:09,817
We bring him to the shelter!

458
00:44:10,108 --> 00:44:12,236
That won't work, they'll know he's not an animal.

459
00:44:12,528 --> 00:44:14,404
I know! We leave him behind in the jungle.

460
00:44:14,696 --> 00:44:16,073
Then he'll be raised by wolves!

461
00:44:16,406 --> 00:44:18,075
I've read something about that, it's terrible.

462
00:44:18,408 --> 00:44:19,868
No, the jungle is too far away.

463
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,913
We'll hide him in a hut, and he'll be our secret.

464
00:44:23,247 --> 00:44:24,456
We'll bathe and feed him.

465
00:44:24,832 --> 00:44:27,876
~ I can only help on Thursdays.
~ Yeah, me, too...

466
00:44:28,293 --> 00:44:29,503
And me, just Thursdays.

467
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,756
Me too, unless I'm grounded, but that's almost all the time.

468
00:44:33,298 --> 00:44:36,927
Well, he could hunt. Like my grandma's cat.

469
00:44:37,219 --> 00:44:40,764
Very funny, babies aren't cats --- they can't feed themselves.

470
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:44,393
I heard everything.

471
00:44:45,853 --> 00:44:47,604
What have you heard, Tattletale?

472
00:44:48,105 --> 00:44:51,275
You want the Nicolas's baby brother to live in a hut in the jungle...

473
00:44:51,567 --> 00:44:54,528
and you're going to make him eat a cat.
I'm going to tell the teacher,...

474
00:44:54,903 --> 00:44:57,114
and also the Director! You'll be severely punished!

475
00:44:58,407 --> 00:45:00,409
~ Unless...
~ Unless what?

476
00:45:00,868 --> 00:45:04,872
~ Unless you back my idea for the spectacle to the teacher.

477
00:45:05,289 --> 00:45:06,498
And what's your idea?

478
00:45:28,896 --> 00:45:29,980
We have a good idea,...

479
00:45:30,272 --> 00:45:31,940
but we can not kidnap the baby ourselves.

480
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:34,109
When the police catch on, we'd be doomed.

481
00:45:34,651 --> 00:45:35,402
The only solution:

482
00:45:36,069 --> 00:45:38,363
The baby has to be abducted by a gangster.

483
00:45:38,989 --> 00:45:41,909
A gangster? But where do you get that idea?

484
00:46:04,515 --> 00:46:07,518
Pssst! Sir!

485
00:46:09,561 --> 00:46:15,776
Come here!

486
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:37,172
Who can tell me what river passes through Paris?

487
00:46:40,175 --> 00:46:40,926
Clotaire?

488
00:46:43,512 --> 00:46:44,847
Clotaire, did you hear the question?

489
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:47,224
Which river runs through Paris?

490
00:46:48,016 --> 00:46:49,393
Yeah, what's that river?

491
00:46:53,856 --> 00:46:56,984
~ Come on!
~ It is...

492
00:47:14,626 --> 00:47:16,628
~ Clotaire?
~ Yes, Ma'am?

493
00:47:17,546 --> 00:47:19,923
Have you ever been with your parents on a boat before?

494
00:47:20,215 --> 00:47:22,551
~ Yes, Ma'am.
~ And where was that?

495
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:24,303
Along the Seine.

496
00:47:27,097 --> 00:47:28,098
You see?

497
00:47:34,688 --> 00:47:37,483
Underlying the litteratie is the counting of syllables...

498
00:47:37,774 --> 00:47:41,320
If the accentuation, which is found in the Icelandic poetry...

499
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:44,531
such Snorrisn SNN... ...uh

500
00:47:46,492 --> 00:47:47,659
I can't really comment.

501
00:47:47,868 --> 00:47:48,619
Then you simply sit.

502
00:47:48,911 --> 00:47:51,205
Help me or give me some feedback?

503
00:47:51,663 --> 00:47:53,290
Snorri Sturluson

504
00:47:53,749 --> 00:47:55,792
Snorri Sturluson who has laid the basis,

505
00:47:55,792 --> 00:47:59,796
by the noun to replace...

506
00:48:00,088 --> 00:48:01,465
a paraphrase or a metaphor.

507
00:48:02,716 --> 00:48:05,928
~ One more thing...music!
~ Ah no, Darling...

508
00:48:06,345 --> 00:48:08,514
I do not think Mrs. Moucheboume wants to talk about music,...

509
00:48:08,805 --> 00:48:11,558
especially after everything you've said about Scandinavian poetry from the 13th century.

510
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:15,062
I think she is a happy, cultivated person to meet...

511
00:48:15,395 --> 00:48:17,773
who enjoys interesting conversation...

512
00:48:18,106 --> 00:48:20,067
while their men talk business.

513
00:48:20,692 --> 00:48:22,569
~ Come on.
~ The Baroque-style.

514
00:48:22,903 --> 00:48:27,032
This arises from the Portuguese word Barocco...

515
00:48:29,493 --> 00:48:33,872
Guys! Look!

516
00:48:36,041 --> 00:48:37,417
Francis Leborgne!

517
00:48:39,086 --> 00:48:40,420
Him we must have!

518
00:48:41,922 --> 00:48:46,385
Recess is over? Come on, you brats!

519
00:48:53,684 --> 00:48:59,314
Children. Your teacher is away a few days.

520
00:48:59,857 --> 00:49:01,650
She will be replaced Mrs. Navaranne.

521
00:49:03,569 --> 00:49:04,778
There she is.

522
00:49:16,331 --> 00:49:18,667
Geography: Rivers of France.

523
00:49:31,972 --> 00:49:33,182
Sit down.

524
00:49:34,099 --> 00:49:35,517
Silence!

525
00:49:38,896 --> 00:49:44,651
Well, today's lesson is about rivers.

526
00:49:45,569 --> 00:49:49,072
I know you know all about this subject.

527
00:49:53,285 --> 00:49:57,789
But first we must hang up the map. Who'll do that?

528
00:49:58,415 --> 00:49:59,833
Sit!

529
00:50:00,876 --> 00:50:03,504
I decide who hangs up the map.

530
00:50:06,256 --> 00:50:09,968
You there, in back...Your name?

531
00:50:11,094 --> 00:50:13,514
Clotaire, Ma'am.

532
00:50:14,890 --> 00:50:16,850
You seem more disciplined than the others.

533
00:50:18,018 --> 00:50:19,394
Go and hang up the map.

534
00:50:21,897 --> 00:50:25,317
~ But Miss...
~ Silence!

535
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:33,867
I see a stubborn fellow.

536
00:50:34,868 --> 00:50:39,832
And stubborn little guys, I break. Clear?

537
00:50:45,712 --> 00:50:48,090
You there. Tell me about the Seine.

538
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,927
The Seine flows from the Plateau of Langres.

539
00:50:52,219 --> 00:50:53,762
And has a length of 776 km.

540
00:50:54,555 --> 00:50:55,848
It extends into the English Channel.

541
00:50:56,515 --> 00:50:57,850
Very good. And you?

542
00:50:58,475 --> 00:51:01,770
The famous rivers: they are
the Aube, the Loing, the Oise, and the Loing.

543
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:02,896
Excellent!

544
00:51:03,814 --> 00:51:07,317
And you, Joker? Yes, yes, you.

545
00:51:07,776 --> 00:51:10,779
If I ask you something, you'll have something to say about the Seine?

546
00:51:12,781 --> 00:51:18,328
I guess not. Into the corner.

547
00:51:18,787 --> 00:51:20,747
That will teach you not to be the class clown.

548
00:51:23,333 --> 00:51:24,376
What's the matter?

549
00:51:24,793 --> 00:51:26,128
He is not used to it, Ma'am.

550
00:51:27,629 --> 00:51:34,094
~ Come on, I'll show you.
~ Very thoughtful of you.

551
00:51:38,765 --> 00:51:40,601
~ There is no yellow-pages for gangster!
~ Search Leborgne.

552
00:51:44,521 --> 00:51:46,648
Francis Leborgne! Got it.

553
00:52:00,287 --> 00:52:01,872
~ Hello?
~ Francis Leborgne?

554
00:52:02,414 --> 00:52:04,708
Just a moment. Francis, for you!

555
00:52:06,919 --> 00:52:09,713
Ask if he can handle the new teacher.

556
00:52:11,465 --> 00:52:12,883
~ Yes?
~ Francis Leborgne?

557
00:52:13,342 --> 00:52:16,053
~ Yes, I am.
~ I've got a clean-up job for you.

558
00:52:16,345 --> 00:52:18,514
A clean-up chore? Wouldn't it better to bring it here?

559
00:52:18,847 --> 00:52:21,183
~ Why come there?
~ I can do it in detail here.

560
00:52:22,601 --> 00:52:30,067
~ No, we just want something solved.
~ Well, that costs money.

561
00:52:33,904 --> 00:52:37,199
If I come, callout costs at least 500 francs.

562
00:52:38,033 --> 00:52:38,784
We'll call you back.

563
00:52:40,994 --> 00:52:43,205
~ What did he say?
~ Tell us!

564
00:52:45,374 --> 00:52:46,959
He wants 500 francs.

565
00:52:48,836 --> 00:52:50,879
What a con, a real gangster!

566
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:53,757
And for the new teacher, how much?

567
00:53:01,473 --> 00:53:04,101
Hey, whose are all those old chocolates?

568
00:53:04,476 --> 00:53:06,895
Do not eat from that, Honey, they've gone off.

569
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:14,486
"Staff room"

570
00:53:18,991 --> 00:53:22,953
~ Yes?
~ Here, a present for you!

571
00:53:25,414 --> 00:53:29,209
Oh...that's nice of you. Thank you.

572
00:53:29,918 --> 00:53:32,504
~ A housekeeper?
~ Yes, I want us to hire a housekeeper.

573
00:53:33,255 --> 00:53:36,633
I won't always have to get up from the table to get food.

574
00:53:37,426 --> 00:53:38,719
And it IS more stylish.

575
00:53:41,263 --> 00:53:44,600
And the menu: "Homard à la mayonnaise".

576
00:53:45,309 --> 00:53:47,436
You know what that would cost?

577
00:53:47,561 --> 00:53:48,812
80 francs per kilo!

578
00:53:53,859 --> 00:53:56,987
We can just do something else with mayonnaise?

579
00:53:57,946 --> 00:54:00,324
And the rest, perhaps, simpler?

580
00:54:00,991 --> 00:54:01,867
A simple meal?

581
00:54:02,159 --> 00:54:05,913
We can also try ham sandwiches in front of the TV if you just want to eat.

582
00:54:11,668 --> 00:54:13,587
I spent the night wondering...

583
00:54:14,129 --> 00:54:17,382
how my friends and I could come up with 500 francs.

584
00:54:18,717 --> 00:54:23,514
Geoffroy brought something special to school.

585
00:54:26,225 --> 00:54:27,100
How does that work?

586
00:54:27,726 --> 00:54:31,939
Got a coin? You choose a number, e.g. 6...

587
00:54:32,356 --> 00:54:35,734
You put the coin on the grid, I crank the roulette wheel,...

588
00:54:36,068 --> 00:54:37,402
And drop the ball...

589
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:42,825
And you've lost.

590
00:54:44,117 --> 00:54:46,203
Thus we'd get 500 francs as the house cut.

591
00:54:46,787 --> 00:54:49,039
We'd have to play against adults, for their money.

592
00:54:51,041 --> 00:54:54,711
What are you doing? Playing roulette? And for money?

593
00:54:55,462 --> 00:54:56,463
This takes the biscuit!

594
00:54:56,755 --> 00:55:00,592
Do you know where this leads? Prison!

595
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:08,976
Hand it over. What a great gift from your parents!

596
00:55:09,893 --> 00:55:11,395
And now, everybody into the classroom.

597
00:55:20,362 --> 00:55:23,615
Bad news for you...

598
00:55:25,117 --> 00:55:29,621
Your replacement has suddenly become ill.

599
00:55:31,039 --> 00:55:33,959
"He murders his teacher!"

600
00:55:37,212 --> 00:55:39,590
The accused is found guilty!

601
00:55:40,632 --> 00:55:42,968
And he is a dirty snitch.

602
00:55:52,019 --> 00:55:53,270
Agnan, what is it?

603
00:55:53,896 --> 00:55:56,398
You can't beat me up, I wear glasses.

604
00:55:58,108 --> 00:56:02,446
Julie the teacher just has a cold, and she's staying home today.

605
00:56:02,946 --> 00:56:05,908
You'll stay in the classroom, under the supervision of a fellow student.

606
00:56:06,575 --> 00:56:09,453
I need someone I can trust.

607
00:56:18,295 --> 00:56:20,797
Well, today we do arithmetic.

608
00:56:21,298 --> 00:56:23,634
Open your workbooks, we'll go with some exercises.

609
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:26,220
Silence, I'm the boss.

610
00:56:26,595 --> 00:56:27,804
Shrink your head, Tattletale!

611
00:56:28,013 --> 00:56:29,765
Eudes, into the corner.

612
00:56:29,973 --> 00:56:31,850
You gonna eat arithmetic.

613
00:56:32,726 --> 00:56:35,270
~ I'm wearing my glasses!
~ Not for long!

614
00:56:38,524 --> 00:56:41,568
Geoffroy! We'll get you back the roulette wheel!

615
00:56:42,027 --> 00:56:42,903
OK, but how?

616
00:57:10,305 --> 00:57:14,101
~ "Death to the teachers"?!
~ No, the profiteers!

617
00:57:14,393 --> 00:57:17,813
Let's go tell that to Mr. Director.

618
00:57:24,403 --> 00:57:28,365
Seldom have I seen something so shameful!

619
00:57:29,783 --> 00:57:31,702
I will not spare you, my young friend.

620
00:57:32,411 --> 00:57:35,247
What punishment do you propose, Mr. Bouillon brouileur... ...er...?

621
00:57:36,373 --> 00:57:40,627
300 times: "I can not write outrageous things,...

622
00:57:41,003 --> 00:57:42,963
"the buildings belonging to the school,...

623
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:47,676
"education and leading me to providing service to the Republic."

624
00:57:49,052 --> 00:57:51,346
As far as "school" seems sufficient.

625
00:57:53,223 --> 00:57:56,059
And don't leave school until you've handed it in!

626
00:57:57,728 --> 00:57:58,979
Understood, little friend?

627
00:58:14,912 --> 00:58:15,913
Do you want a go, Ma'am?

628
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:19,208
I'll try it, it looks like fun!

629
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:22,127
~ How much can I bet?
~ 10 francs!

630
00:58:27,174 --> 00:58:30,552
~ And on what number?
~ Anything you want.

631
00:58:31,178 --> 00:58:34,223
~ Four, for example.
~ Come on, then, four.

632
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:37,142
Ten on number four...in it goes!

633
00:58:43,065 --> 00:58:45,609
I won!

634
00:59:22,187 --> 00:59:24,898
But...is that everything you did in one hour?

635
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:37,202
Like this.

636
01:00:02,102 --> 01:00:04,229
But where is she?

637
01:00:11,236 --> 01:00:14,239
~ Honey, can you tie this?
~ I'm tied up myself!

638
01:00:14,573 --> 01:00:17,367
I spent the whole day slaving in the kitchen and now she's not here.

639
01:00:17,618 --> 01:00:19,203
Where is she?

640
01:00:23,499 --> 01:00:25,417
~ Calm down...
~ Why calm, tell me that?

641
01:00:25,667 --> 01:00:28,086
The Moucheboumes are almost here, and I have no one to serve!

642
01:00:28,337 --> 01:00:29,838
Ah, there she is.

643
01:00:32,549 --> 01:00:37,012
Here, put that in back in the trash...! Hup hup hup!

644
01:00:40,474 --> 01:00:43,310
~ What's this?
~ That's "Homard à la mayonnaise".

645
01:00:43,936 --> 01:00:48,482
This is great for guests, but you get delicious ravioli!

646
01:00:49,316 --> 01:00:52,569
~ I don't want it, I want lobster.
~ Nicolas, stop it!

647
01:00:56,031 --> 01:00:58,200
But where is she now, that klutz!

648
01:01:04,039 --> 01:01:06,542
~ Good evening Mr. Moucheboume!
~ Good evening, Madam.

649
01:01:07,835 --> 01:01:09,086
My wife isn't here?

650
01:01:10,295 --> 01:01:13,215
I had sent her on ahead, while I parked the car!

651
01:01:13,465 --> 01:01:14,174
She's disappeared.

652
01:01:19,763 --> 01:01:23,809
Oh, Mrs. Moucheboume! What a mistake, sorry!

653
01:01:24,643 --> 01:01:29,815
Come with me...We are all...

654
01:01:38,907 --> 01:01:40,033
Nicolas, go get your dad.

655
01:01:50,586 --> 01:01:52,796
Good evening, Mr. and Mrs. Moucheboume.

656
01:01:53,130 --> 01:01:55,465
Ah! Here's the famous Nicolas!

657
01:01:56,550 --> 01:01:58,552
Are you happy with your humming top?

658
01:01:58,844 --> 01:02:00,596
You bet! But Dad does not want me playing with it,...

659
01:02:00,596 --> 01:02:02,347
because the bitch makes such a racket.

660
01:02:03,348 --> 01:02:04,975
The next time I'll give you something else.

661
01:02:06,185 --> 01:02:07,186
What would you like?

662
01:02:08,479 --> 01:02:10,731
If you could give me 500 francs, that would be super.

663
01:02:14,568 --> 01:02:16,612
What would you do with 500 francs?

664
01:02:17,863 --> 01:02:19,406
I can only whisper.

665
01:02:22,576 --> 01:02:26,580
I'll get my new brother kidnapped, so my parents don't throw me away.

666
01:02:33,086 --> 01:02:39,301
Nicolas, listen, if you want to earn money, you must work hard.

667
01:02:41,345 --> 01:02:42,638
You'll have the money then.

668
01:02:42,930 --> 01:02:44,765
If you give it to me now, I'll thank you immediately.

669
01:02:45,432 --> 01:02:46,809
Nicolas, go to the kitchen!

670
01:02:49,269 --> 01:02:50,854
Oh, he's just a child.

671
01:02:51,730 --> 01:02:54,733
~ I told them goodbye.
~ Very well, here.

672
01:02:57,653 --> 01:02:59,321
And you can start eating.

673
01:03:19,049 --> 01:03:21,635
Do you fancy Scandinavian literature, Mrs. Moucheboume?

674
01:03:23,387 --> 01:03:26,431
Personally, I prefer poetry from the 13th century.

675
01:03:28,058 --> 01:03:32,855
Replacing the personal pronoun, a metaphor...

676
01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:37,776
That is very interesting.

677
01:03:40,362 --> 01:03:41,530
Erm...

678
01:03:44,491 --> 01:03:46,702
I have a particular weakness for...
Snorrie-verses.

679
01:03:48,078 --> 01:03:49,163
Snurkie-Snuf...

680
01:03:50,247 --> 01:03:53,917
Mustache... ...Storkie Stor-sleeve.

681
01:03:55,210 --> 01:03:56,753
Smeurkiestuf

682
01:04:06,889 --> 01:04:10,476
Did you know that the word "baroque" comes from Portugal?

683
01:04:12,227 --> 01:04:15,564
The city Barocco, known for its oysters.

684
01:04:15,939 --> 01:04:18,942
And by Luly and the chocolate with the same name.

685
01:04:33,749 --> 01:04:36,835
~ Are we hungry?
~ Yes!

686
01:04:39,046 --> 01:04:41,048
It will be a simple meal.

687
01:04:41,548 --> 01:04:43,425
That's lucky. I hate people...

688
01:04:43,884 --> 01:04:45,761
who try to impress us with things like,...

689
01:04:45,761 --> 01:04:47,763
"Homard à la mayonnaise".

690
01:04:50,390 --> 01:04:52,059
One small moment...

691
01:05:09,409 --> 01:05:10,744
Voilà!

692
01:05:45,863 --> 01:05:49,074
"WELCOME TO THE MINISTER"

693
01:05:54,538 --> 01:05:56,456
We can sing in the streets!

694
01:05:56,707 --> 01:05:58,667
Or sell things on the street!

695
01:06:00,252 --> 01:06:02,963
No, we have to find something quickly --- it's a lot of  money.

696
01:06:03,463 --> 01:06:05,716
Wait! My dad told me how he became rich!

697
01:06:06,717 --> 01:06:10,804
He found an apple on the street, and sold for 1 franc.

698
01:06:11,263 --> 01:06:11,763
And then?

699
01:06:11,763 --> 01:06:14,766
With the franc, he bought 2 apples, which he sold for 2 francs.

700
01:06:14,975 --> 01:06:15,309
And then?

701
01:06:16,393 --> 01:06:18,479
Then his aunt died, and he got all her money.

702
01:06:19,855 --> 01:06:20,772
And then?

703
01:06:21,607 --> 01:06:22,858
Guys, the girl is back!

704
01:06:38,165 --> 01:06:38,874
There they are!

705
01:06:41,210 --> 01:06:42,920
I want exemplary behavior.

706
01:06:43,420 --> 01:06:45,672
The first one who gives kicks up gets a life sentence.

707
01:06:46,006 --> 01:06:47,257
Is that clear?

708
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:54,890
OK, good.

709
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:14,618
Sit, children.

710
01:07:20,749 --> 01:07:26,588
Say, how is your school? Well?

711
01:07:29,591 --> 01:07:31,718
They need to relax, these children.

712
01:07:33,303 --> 01:07:37,099
I have a riddle for you. Listen up.

713
01:07:37,349 --> 01:07:43,605
What is yellow, very small, and it says krok krok.

714
01:07:49,111 --> 01:07:52,447
A chick that eats chips.

715
01:08:04,126 --> 01:08:06,879
~ What have you learned this year?
~ Rivers.

716
01:08:09,339 --> 01:08:13,302
~ I'll try that.
~ Well, just stand up, Agnan.

717
01:08:13,302 --> 01:08:17,556
No, the boy in back.

718
01:08:21,059 --> 01:08:24,813
~ What's your name, boy?
~ Clotaire, Sir.

719
01:08:25,355 --> 01:08:26,940
Well. Say...

720
01:08:27,524 --> 01:08:31,278
Which river flows through Paris?

721
01:08:39,453 --> 01:08:43,499
I think...the river, which flows through Paris.

722
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:01,141
"Have you ever been with your parents on a boat before?"

723
01:09:11,527 --> 01:09:12,528
The Seine.

724
01:09:23,330 --> 01:09:24,998
Good, Clotaire!

725
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:28,836
Was it a tough question?

726
01:09:35,717 --> 01:09:36,927
How are the negotiations going?

727
01:09:37,594 --> 01:09:38,470
I would stand firm.

728
01:09:38,887 --> 01:09:40,806
And about what percentage are we talking?

729
01:09:40,806 --> 01:09:41,640
Minimum 10.

730
01:09:42,391 --> 01:09:44,476
Draft a summary for me of the file.

731
01:09:50,524 --> 01:09:52,359
~ Hello?
~ It's me.

732
01:09:52,860 --> 01:09:55,362
Did Mr. Moucheboume say anything about the food?

733
01:10:06,540 --> 01:10:09,877
I know how to get the money together! Look!

734
01:10:44,828 --> 01:10:47,289
Hey, Guys, are you, like, invincible?

735
01:10:47,581 --> 01:10:48,415
What are you talking about?

736
01:10:48,665 --> 01:10:50,501
Come to the swampy vacant lot --- you know it!

737
01:10:56,924 --> 01:10:58,008
OK, then?

738
01:10:58,467 --> 01:11:00,761
We have the formula of this potion!

739
01:11:03,222 --> 01:11:05,390
Drink it, and you'll get really strong!

740
01:11:06,225 --> 01:11:07,184
It costs 5 francs.

741
01:11:07,559 --> 01:11:08,936
And how do we know it works?

742
01:11:09,561 --> 01:11:12,439
You there. Come here.

743
01:11:31,041 --> 01:11:34,211
And now go push on that bus.

744
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:36,356
~ Next! Pay first.

745
01:12:40,819 --> 01:12:41,612
Paid.

746
01:12:56,543 --> 01:12:59,129
~ Do we have enough?
~ We might just.

747
01:13:19,942 --> 01:13:23,111
All together, then...

748
01:13:24,905 --> 01:13:26,281
530 francs!

749
01:13:27,658 --> 01:13:31,036
What have you done with my son?

750
01:13:32,412 --> 01:13:33,872
I want to talk to your parents!

751
01:13:34,498 --> 01:13:36,124
Bunch of crooks!

752
01:13:40,712 --> 01:13:45,425
You guys are in for a hiding!

753
01:13:56,770 --> 01:13:58,272
We have money for the cleanup chore.

754
01:13:58,605 --> 01:14:02,985
~ Well, where is the car?
~ Uh, we'll call you back.

755
01:14:04,486 --> 01:14:06,155
Now he wants us to have a car!

756
01:14:28,802 --> 01:14:30,095
What flavor, sir?

757
01:14:32,222 --> 01:14:35,184
~ Pardon?
~ Strawberry-Chocolate!

758
01:14:35,684 --> 01:14:36,477
Very well, sir.

759
01:14:54,536 --> 01:14:56,413
The others are waiting at the telephone.

760
01:14:58,665 --> 01:15:01,210
~ What?
~ I don't know how to drive.

761
01:15:01,710 --> 01:15:04,171
~ You have to use the key.
~ He took it with him!

762
01:15:04,379 --> 01:15:06,298
Then you have to jump the cables.

763
01:15:06,298 --> 01:15:07,841
I remember that from a movie.

764
01:15:37,955 --> 01:15:42,251
Turning: reasonable. Maneuver in the city: moderate.

765
01:15:43,752 --> 01:15:45,712
Let's see how you park.

766
01:15:48,173 --> 01:15:49,508
Let's head down town.

767
01:15:57,224 --> 01:15:58,725
Come on, follow that car!

768
01:15:59,268 --> 01:16:02,437
Faster, come on, pedal to the metal!

769
01:16:19,454 --> 01:16:21,290
Go down there!

770
01:16:28,005 --> 01:16:29,756
I need a confidant in this company.

771
01:16:30,507 --> 01:16:32,259
You know, I don't plan to live forever.

772
01:16:32,551 --> 01:16:34,720
I must think of a successor.

773
01:16:35,721 --> 01:16:37,055
Look out!

774
01:16:43,228 --> 01:16:46,273
Say, good thing you were there.

775
01:16:48,192 --> 01:16:51,111
By the way, what do you think about internationalization?

776
01:16:51,945 --> 01:16:53,614
You can not deny Europe.

777
01:16:54,072 --> 01:16:55,949
Exactly, I think that now.

778
01:16:56,450 --> 01:16:57,493
~ But...
~ Shut up.

779
01:17:31,860 --> 01:17:33,320
Parking is also OK.

780
01:17:34,029 --> 01:17:34,863
Thank you.

781
01:17:58,762 --> 01:18:00,347
Your ideas never work out!

782
01:18:03,392 --> 01:18:05,394
Will we get to the phone in time?

783
01:18:05,686 --> 01:18:06,603
I don't know.

784
01:18:08,730 --> 01:18:11,650
~ Huh?
~ How did we end up here?

785
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:18,240
~ Hi, I would like to talk with Francis Leborgne.

786
01:18:19,658 --> 01:18:20,742
I'll hang on.

787
01:18:22,411 --> 01:18:25,998
~ Hey, that's Joaquim!
~ Hey, Guys!

788
01:18:27,791 --> 01:18:29,376
But...you're not gone?!

789
01:18:29,793 --> 01:18:32,254
No, I only had the chickenpox.

790
01:18:35,257 --> 01:18:38,677
See, here's my brother. Look how nice he is!

791
01:18:40,888 --> 01:18:43,015
Don't touch him or he'll get sick.

792
01:18:43,515 --> 01:18:44,808
Babies are very sensitive.

793
01:18:48,187 --> 01:18:49,855
Hear that, he said my name!

794
01:18:50,772 --> 01:18:52,232
But you didn't want a brother!

795
01:18:52,483 --> 01:18:53,734
No, but that was before.

796
01:18:54,276 --> 01:18:55,319
Why?

797
01:18:55,736 --> 01:18:58,363
Before I knew it was super being a big brother.

798
01:18:58,614 --> 01:19:01,074
I can teach him all sorts of great things.

799
01:19:01,575 --> 01:19:03,076
Soccer, or cycling.

800
01:19:03,660 --> 01:19:05,329
And I will always be an example.

801
01:19:05,746 --> 01:19:08,624
"At your age, Joachim could already..."

802
01:19:09,082 --> 01:19:10,792
And he will be super impressed.

803
01:19:11,335 --> 01:19:13,921
I can give him orders, and he'll do what I want.

804
01:19:16,215 --> 01:19:18,175
Well, bye, Guys.

805
01:19:28,143 --> 01:19:33,482
Yes? Hello? Hello!

806
01:19:36,819 --> 01:19:40,364
I'm never going to drive a car again in my entire life!

807
01:19:40,823 --> 01:19:43,909
~ But you got your license!
~ NEVER!

808
01:19:44,952 --> 01:19:46,662
Mommy! Daddy!

809
01:19:47,162 --> 01:19:49,039
Thanks. I'm so happy!

810
01:19:49,373 --> 01:19:50,374
Why, Baby?

811
01:19:50,374 --> 01:19:52,709
~ I'm going to have a brother!
~ What did you say, Nicolas?

812
01:19:52,709 --> 01:19:55,671
~ What brother?
~ The baby that Mom gets!

813
01:19:57,965 --> 01:20:01,802
You're not getting a brother --- how did you get that idea?

814
01:20:02,803 --> 01:20:06,390
But...I want a brother!

815
01:20:07,015 --> 01:20:08,559
That would be great, a little brother.

816
01:20:10,185 --> 01:20:12,104
Why can't I have one?

817
01:20:14,106 --> 01:20:16,316
You never get me anything!

818
01:22:09,304 --> 01:22:14,935
That evening, my parents went overboard continuing with their jokes.

819
01:22:16,562 --> 01:22:18,939
One day, when I came home,...

820
01:22:24,111 --> 01:22:27,656
they had big news to tell me.

821
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:32,119
I do not know how long it takes,...

822
01:22:32,452 --> 01:22:36,123
but a baby takes longer than waiting for Christmas.

823
01:22:36,832 --> 01:22:39,209
~ Day after tomorrow, then?
~ Afraid not.

824
01:22:41,712 --> 01:22:45,132
Life was back to the old ways.

825
01:22:48,969 --> 01:22:52,181
Geoffroy was in trouble for stealing the car.

826
01:22:53,390 --> 01:22:57,394
Now he must walk to school.

827
01:23:00,105 --> 01:23:01,523
I saw Marie-Edwige again.

828
01:23:01,523 --> 01:23:03,192
They invited me to her birthday.

829
01:23:03,567 --> 01:23:08,113
Thursday? I'm busy then, but I'll make time on Friday.

830
01:23:09,656 --> 01:23:11,867
Somehow that didn't sound right...

831
01:23:15,871 --> 01:23:17,581
And we got a new neighbor.

832
01:23:19,249 --> 01:23:23,337
Dad and he have been bickering, too.

833
01:23:28,091 --> 01:23:29,551
And I keep on waiting...

834
01:23:29,968 --> 01:23:31,178
~ Tomorrow?
~ No.

835
01:23:31,804 --> 01:23:32,930
But soon.

836
01:23:33,305 --> 01:23:36,850
I could not wait to teach my brother things.

837
01:23:51,281 --> 01:23:52,449
And then one morning...

838
01:23:53,283 --> 01:23:55,410
We all went to the hospital.

839
01:23:57,412 --> 01:23:59,540
And then my little brother finally arrived.

840
01:24:01,583 --> 01:24:03,919
~ It's a girl!
~ WHAT?

841
01:24:06,171 --> 01:24:07,422
Well, give it a kick!

842
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:16,515
Look!

843
01:24:23,230 --> 01:24:25,858
She's so sweet, a real angel!

844
01:24:26,233 --> 01:24:28,902
She looks exactly like her father.

845
01:24:29,236 --> 01:24:31,321
No, she's the spitting image of her mother.

846
01:24:41,123 --> 01:24:42,624
And Nicolas, are you happy with your sister?

847
01:24:43,333 --> 01:24:44,209
Hard to say.

848
01:24:45,878 --> 01:24:49,047
She is not finished yet, they still  have to install the hair and teeth.

849
01:24:49,506 --> 01:24:51,675
~ But she's cute anyway?
~ Cute?

850
01:24:52,301 --> 01:24:55,804
She's bright red and wrinkled like roasted peppers.

851
01:24:57,014 --> 01:25:00,309
She sees nothing with her eyes, but she's mastered drooling.

852
01:25:01,310 --> 01:25:05,522
Everyone says she laughs, but she's just blowing bubbles.

853
01:25:08,609 --> 01:25:12,488
I wanted a brother, but Mom had that there instead.

854
01:25:13,113 --> 01:25:14,281
I'm not sure why.

855
01:25:16,825 --> 01:25:21,288
She looks like a shaved cat.

856
01:25:24,625 --> 01:25:28,045
If I had known, I'd have asked for a dog instead.

857
01:25:37,429 --> 01:25:44,853
It's crazy, but at that moment I knew what my essay should be on.

858
01:25:59,451 --> 01:26:01,161
What did I want to do when I grew up?

859
01:26:01,495 --> 01:26:03,247
Make people laugh.

860
01:26:11,463 --> 01:26:14,174
Look at me. Look at me.
