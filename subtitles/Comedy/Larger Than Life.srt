1
00:00:39,325 --> 00:00:40,656
Thank you.

2
00:00:41,027 --> 00:00:43,325
Thank you and welcome,
ladies and gentlemen...

3
00:00:43,396 --> 00:00:45,591
...to the 34th Annual Convention...

4
00:00:45,665 --> 00:00:48,862
...of the American Motion
Upholstery Association.

5
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:52,159
Thank you.

6
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,673
Wasn't lunch wonderful?

7
00:00:56,843 --> 00:00:58,606
Perfect. As you know...

8
00:00:58,678 --> 00:01:01,545
...this year's not been
an easy one for our industry.

9
00:01:01,647 --> 00:01:04,810
As we're listening to our inspiring
keynote speaker today...

10
00:01:04,884 --> 00:01:07,978
...he'll be giving us a useful shot in the arm.

11
00:01:09,822 --> 00:01:12,222
He is the author of the book Get Over lt...

12
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:14,953
...a rising star in the field
of personal motivation.

13
00:01:15,027 --> 00:01:16,289
Yes, Mom.

14
00:01:17,029 --> 00:01:19,190
I will. On time.

15
00:01:19,699 --> 00:01:22,600
No, okay, but I've got be on time, now,
for my introduction.

16
00:01:22,668 --> 00:01:24,533
Please don't call during the speech.

17
00:01:24,604 --> 00:01:27,004
Remember,
as we listen to his inspiring words...

18
00:01:27,073 --> 00:01:30,270
...that motion is our middle name.

19
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,973
And forward motion is our goal.

20
00:01:34,847 --> 00:01:38,874
I'm glad you're gonna
get to know Jack Cochran.

21
00:01:39,452 --> 00:01:40,749
Corcoran!

22
00:01:45,958 --> 00:01:47,391
I'm over it.

23
00:01:52,632 --> 00:01:55,499
Hello. Thank you. Thank you, John.

24
00:01:57,036 --> 00:01:59,027
My father died before I was born...

25
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:03,136
...trying to save a child
drowning in icy water.

26
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:08,112
And it took me a long time
before I stopped resenting that.

27
00:02:08,781 --> 00:02:10,271
Finally I did.

28
00:02:11,651 --> 00:02:13,016
Finally...

29
00:02:14,587 --> 00:02:16,578
...I was able to get over it.

30
00:02:18,257 --> 00:02:19,519
And when I did...

31
00:02:19,592 --> 00:02:21,025
...I found out...

32
00:02:21,294 --> 00:02:22,761
...a lot of things...

33
00:02:23,129 --> 00:02:24,562
...about me...

34
00:02:24,931 --> 00:02:26,592
...that were neat.

35
00:02:26,799 --> 00:02:29,427
Neat things that I wanted to
share with other people...

36
00:02:29,502 --> 00:02:32,596
...who maybe didn't know
some neat things about themselves.

37
00:02:33,206 --> 00:02:36,903
Now, I see some people out here
looking just confused as heck.

38
00:02:36,976 --> 00:02:39,638
Now, here's somebody here
who's just bored to tears.

39
00:02:40,446 --> 00:02:44,610
Don't tell him I'm gonna look at his nametag.
Richie, I caught you!

40
00:02:44,851 --> 00:02:48,787
I caught him. Richie's here
building a pyramid of sugar cubes.

41
00:02:49,589 --> 00:02:51,819
You made a nice pyramid.
You have good ideas.

42
00:02:51,891 --> 00:02:54,519
You want to do things, you're motivated.
That's okay.

43
00:02:54,594 --> 00:02:57,825
But wouldn't you rather
work with people than with sugar cubes?

44
00:02:58,698 --> 00:03:00,928
Don't think about it too much. Come here.

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,026
Come on, help me out here.
Who else we got here? Who's this?

46
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:06,600
Joe, stand up. Come on here.
You're a big guy.

47
00:03:06,672 --> 00:03:08,435
Looks like a hip cat, right? Who else?

48
00:03:08,508 --> 00:03:11,534
Come here, you.
You're a big drink of water. Get over here.

49
00:03:11,611 --> 00:03:12,908
Careful, everybody.

50
00:03:12,979 --> 00:03:16,745
Are you supposed to be in a parade, later?
Nice outfit. Lookin' great.

51
00:03:17,016 --> 00:03:19,610
Would you mind getting down
on your hands and knees?

52
00:03:20,386 --> 00:03:23,082
Come on, make a move.
I don't have all day. Let's go.

53
00:03:23,155 --> 00:03:25,817
These are busy people,
and we don't have all day.

54
00:03:25,892 --> 00:03:28,292
Mike, is it?
Will you play our game? Come on.

55
00:03:28,361 --> 00:03:29,692
You ever done this before?

56
00:03:29,762 --> 00:03:33,220
It's a big thing in our country.
Get right up on Marion, here, okay?

57
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:36,165
Put a knee right in the middle
of Marion's back.

58
00:03:36,235 --> 00:03:38,931
Come on. You're gonna love this.

59
00:03:39,005 --> 00:03:41,633
Hey, come on, you.
You're a mid-size. Get over here.

60
00:03:41,707 --> 00:03:43,038
Get over here, on him.

61
00:03:43,109 --> 00:03:45,805
Get over here. A knee on him.
You've seen it before.

62
00:03:45,878 --> 00:03:49,336
Okay, we want an itty-bitty.
Betty, come on. Let's go.

63
00:03:50,149 --> 00:03:53,277
No, it's not horsy this time. No, I'm sorry.

64
00:03:53,352 --> 00:03:56,378
This isn't the vacation you dreamed of.
Right over here.

65
00:03:56,656 --> 00:03:58,886
Let me help you out here now.

66
00:04:01,661 --> 00:04:03,424
Help me, somebody.

67
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:07,791
I'm a motivator, not a physical therapist.
Get over here.

68
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,630
Look, center. Come on, here. All right, now.

69
00:04:10,803 --> 00:04:12,794
Come here. Help me out.

70
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,736
Lift her.

71
00:04:15,942 --> 00:04:16,931
Ally...

72
00:04:17,009 --> 00:04:19,273
One, two, three.

73
00:04:22,214 --> 00:04:25,479
- Is that the kind of thing you hoped for?
- Yeah.

74
00:04:25,985 --> 00:04:28,681
We got men and women
working together for the same cause.

75
00:04:28,754 --> 00:04:30,153
We've built something beautiful.

76
00:04:30,222 --> 00:04:34,181
Let's get this over in a hurry.
Joe, come on. Pull 'em out here. All right.

77
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:38,788
Whereas my first wife, Gloria,
was a caretaker, a codependent...

78
00:04:39,165 --> 00:04:42,134
...a complainer, my fiancée, Celeste...

79
00:04:42,368 --> 00:04:46,828
...will be a caring person, my coequal,
and a celebrator.

80
00:04:47,707 --> 00:04:49,766
I'm graduating from my A, B, Cs...

81
00:04:49,842 --> 00:04:52,504
...to D, E and F.

82
00:04:53,312 --> 00:04:56,645
Deliberate, Eliminate, and Finish.

83
00:04:56,849 --> 00:04:59,340
Jack Cochran, ladies and gentlemen.

84
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,700
First, on the side.

85
00:05:16,769 --> 00:05:19,636
Yes, right on the side, and then the olive.

86
00:05:19,705 --> 00:05:22,640
Always better if you put the parsley on first.

87
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:23,834
You see there?

88
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:25,433
- Sweetheart.
- Hi.

89
00:05:25,511 --> 00:05:27,877
Change out of your suit, honey.

90
00:05:27,947 --> 00:05:30,438
I stopped by your place
and got your sports jacket.

91
00:05:30,516 --> 00:05:31,881
Thank you.

92
00:05:34,987 --> 00:05:36,284
He is so cute.

93
00:05:42,962 --> 00:05:46,454
You got three dates coming up.
You got Modesto on the 18th...

94
00:05:46,532 --> 00:05:48,523
...the Wall Applications Association.

95
00:05:48,601 --> 00:05:50,933
Is that anything like wallpaper?

96
00:05:52,605 --> 00:05:55,768
Don't hurt me like that, okay?
I go very deep for you, Jack.

97
00:05:55,841 --> 00:05:59,504
This is when he was a baby.
This was when he was in the sixth grade.

98
00:05:59,578 --> 00:06:02,103
On the 21st,
the American Sand and Gravel Congress.

99
00:06:02,181 --> 00:06:06,743
Now we are doubling up, because I think I
did the Grit Festival 2 months ago, didn't I?

100
00:06:06,819 --> 00:06:08,446
They're not interested in your jokes.

101
00:06:08,521 --> 00:06:09,818
Isn't he gorgeous?

102
00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:13,484
Their entire focus is going to be
on expanding their market share.

103
00:06:13,559 --> 00:06:16,756
Why don't you put your focus
on getting me some better gigs?

104
00:06:16,829 --> 00:06:18,694
I got you a better gig, all right?

105
00:06:18,764 --> 00:06:21,494
The Investment Strategy Summit,
New Orleans.

106
00:06:21,567 --> 00:06:25,731
- That could lead to an infomercial.
- From your mouth to God's ears.

107
00:06:26,072 --> 00:06:27,300
Listen...

108
00:06:27,473 --> 00:06:31,307
...if I may say,
I endorse this engagement fully, all right?

109
00:06:31,577 --> 00:06:34,478
Without family obligations,
you're vulnerable to drift.

110
00:06:35,114 --> 00:06:36,809
You are a romantic.

111
00:06:38,784 --> 00:06:40,149
I'm gonna drift.

112
00:06:43,055 --> 00:06:45,615
- Jack, she's wonderful.
- Great.

113
00:06:45,691 --> 00:06:48,159
Jack, congratulations, you old son-of-a-gun.

114
00:06:49,395 --> 00:06:52,660
- Hey, Jack, congratulations. Beautiful.
- Thank you, Moonman.

115
00:06:59,772 --> 00:07:01,569
These are old.

116
00:07:01,807 --> 00:07:03,968
These are magic animals, Mr. Matt.

117
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:05,575
Really?

118
00:07:05,845 --> 00:07:07,176
My father made these.

119
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,038
Time for telegrams.

120
00:07:09,148 --> 00:07:11,207
"You've only just begun.

121
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:14,410
"A kiss for luck, and you're on your way.

122
00:07:15,054 --> 00:07:16,180
"Walter."

123
00:07:16,756 --> 00:07:18,621
That's lovely!

124
00:07:18,891 --> 00:07:20,518
It's from a song.

125
00:07:21,093 --> 00:07:22,117
Yeah, I'm here.

126
00:07:22,194 --> 00:07:24,685
"Dear Mr. Corcoran." It's for me.

127
00:07:25,531 --> 00:07:28,967
"We regret to inform you
of the death of your father."

128
00:07:30,035 --> 00:07:32,230
Well, this is original, anyway.

129
00:07:32,938 --> 00:07:35,065
I hope nobody thought that was funny.

130
00:07:35,374 --> 00:07:36,398
Hold on a second.

131
00:07:36,475 --> 00:07:39,273
This says he died last month in Maryland.

132
00:07:39,645 --> 00:07:42,705
That's not funny.
That's not funny at all. Here, let me...

133
00:07:42,782 --> 00:07:44,010
All right, wait.

134
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:47,177
"We have been placed
in charge of his effects...

135
00:07:47,253 --> 00:07:50,347
"...and rather large inheritance." We're rich.

136
00:07:50,422 --> 00:07:54,552
"We recommend that you come to our offices
as soon as possible to claim same.

137
00:07:54,627 --> 00:07:56,288
"Trowbridge Bowers, Attorney at Law."

138
00:07:56,362 --> 00:08:00,696
- Is that true?
- No, this is just some bureaucratic bungling.

139
00:08:00,766 --> 00:08:02,734
Don't worry, I'll call them tomorrow.

140
00:08:02,802 --> 00:08:06,431
You don't need to call a lawyer
and tell him your husband died 40 years ago.

141
00:08:06,505 --> 00:08:10,999
- I'll tell them we'll take the inheritance.
- Just let me do it, Jackie, please.

142
00:08:14,914 --> 00:08:16,575
Are you all right?

143
00:08:16,949 --> 00:08:19,645
Of course. I'm always all right.

144
00:08:21,587 --> 00:08:24,249
You haven't called me Jackie
since I was a little kid.

145
00:08:25,457 --> 00:08:26,446
Mom...

146
00:08:28,527 --> 00:08:30,791
Mom, you just can't say:

147
00:08:31,163 --> 00:08:34,132
"Okay, maybe he hasn't been dead
all these years.

148
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:35,732
"Let's do the dishes."

149
00:08:36,902 --> 00:08:39,803
- Well, what can I say?
- You can't say that.

150
00:08:39,872 --> 00:08:41,499
Jackie, just calm down.

151
00:08:41,574 --> 00:08:45,908
I had a dad all these years and I didn't know
it, and now that I know, I don't have one.

152
00:08:45,978 --> 00:08:49,277
Jack? Why don't we go in...

153
00:08:49,348 --> 00:08:51,316
Am I crazy?

154
00:08:52,418 --> 00:08:53,885
I left him, Jack.

155
00:08:53,953 --> 00:08:58,185
I left him, and I took you with me,
and I didn't tell him where we were going.

156
00:08:59,325 --> 00:09:01,691
- Did he beat you?
- No, he didn't beat me.

157
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,320
- Was he a criminal?
- No, he wasn't a criminal.

158
00:09:04,396 --> 00:09:06,921
Well then, tell me, Mom, what was he?

159
00:09:07,066 --> 00:09:09,296
He was irresponsible!

160
00:09:10,536 --> 00:09:12,060
Irresponsible?

161
00:09:12,137 --> 00:09:13,968
He wouldn't hold down a job.

162
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:16,530
He kept moving us
from one place to another.

163
00:09:16,609 --> 00:09:20,045
I couldn't count on a man like that
when I had a baby.

164
00:09:21,914 --> 00:09:24,474
- He was irresponsible, so you killed him.
- Jack, l...

165
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:28,077
- Jack, she didn't kill him.
- She did kill him. She drowned him.

166
00:09:28,153 --> 00:09:33,113
I couldn't have him influencing you.
Boys learn from their fathers.

167
00:09:33,826 --> 00:09:35,817
I'll have to take your word on that.

168
00:09:36,629 --> 00:09:37,721
Jack!

169
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:41,594
Did I do something wrong?

170
00:09:43,502 --> 00:09:44,764
Let him walk it off.

171
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,945
Yes, I'm on hold.

172
00:09:58,417 --> 00:10:01,545
Excuse me, I'm looking for
Trowbridge Bowers, Attorney at Law.

173
00:10:04,223 --> 00:10:06,088
My name is Jack Corcoran.

174
00:10:06,158 --> 00:10:08,183
- Your people sent me this.
- You're him.

175
00:10:10,429 --> 00:10:12,954
Mr. Bowers, it's the son.

176
00:10:13,766 --> 00:10:14,824
Yes?

177
00:10:16,368 --> 00:10:20,134
Well, Mr. Corcoran, at last. Come in.

178
00:10:20,439 --> 00:10:23,203
Nice to meet you,
under difficult circumstances, son.

179
00:10:23,275 --> 00:10:25,505
Have the... brought around now.

180
00:10:25,778 --> 00:10:28,338
Sit down. All right, sir.

181
00:10:28,847 --> 00:10:30,838
Took a while to find you.

182
00:10:32,251 --> 00:10:34,344
I know this came as a shock.

183
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:37,412
- Mr. Bowers, I never knew my father.
- Nor did I.

184
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,048
Heart attack.

185
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:41,517
Happened to be passing through town.

186
00:10:42,094 --> 00:10:45,325
Since I represent
the facility where he was appearing...

187
00:10:45,397 --> 00:10:47,991
...it fell to me to take charge...

188
00:10:48,067 --> 00:10:49,728
...of his effects.

189
00:10:49,902 --> 00:10:51,233
Appearing?

190
00:10:52,004 --> 00:10:52,993
This...

191
00:10:53,305 --> 00:10:55,068
...should clarify.

192
00:10:57,242 --> 00:10:59,107
My father was a giant?

193
00:10:59,244 --> 00:11:02,077
We saved his nose. Here.

194
00:11:06,085 --> 00:11:07,575
I had a clown for a dad?

195
00:11:07,653 --> 00:11:10,986
And a very jolly one, I understand.
Traveled with a small circus.

196
00:11:11,056 --> 00:11:13,752
When he passed away,
the caravan moved on.

197
00:11:13,826 --> 00:11:16,624
Now, Mr. Corcoran, as to your bequest.

198
00:11:16,695 --> 00:11:19,459
There's a rather substantial
dollar figure involved.

199
00:11:21,667 --> 00:11:23,066
I'm over it.

200
00:11:23,702 --> 00:11:24,726
How much?

201
00:11:24,803 --> 00:11:27,738
Marcy, can you bring in
Mr. Corcoran's papers, please?

202
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:30,539
Thank you.

203
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:35,979
Right here, Mr. Corcoran, is the amount.

204
00:11:36,615 --> 00:11:39,140
$35,000?

205
00:11:39,318 --> 00:11:41,411
Well, thanks, Dad, for something.

206
00:11:41,653 --> 00:11:45,555
- What? Do I have to sign something?
- Yes, right there.

207
00:11:47,059 --> 00:11:49,459
Marcy, if you'll witness, please.

208
00:11:54,199 --> 00:11:55,894
Now, forgive me for asking...

209
00:11:55,968 --> 00:11:58,801
...but this a great deal of money.

210
00:11:59,938 --> 00:12:02,429
How will you be paying the $35,000?

211
00:12:02,841 --> 00:12:05,969
What? Wait a minute. Me, pay you?

212
00:12:06,045 --> 00:12:10,038
- My fee, property damage, upkeep...
- Upkeep of a trunk?

213
00:12:11,984 --> 00:12:14,509
There's the bulk of your inheritance.

214
00:12:17,356 --> 00:12:18,414
No.

215
00:12:18,857 --> 00:12:20,256
I don't want it.

216
00:12:20,359 --> 00:12:22,259
Why would the man leave me an elephant?

217
00:12:22,327 --> 00:12:24,090
Hey, come back here!

218
00:12:25,264 --> 00:12:28,256
There's your property damage.
It hates fences.

219
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,301
Well, I'm not paying for
what somebody's elephant does.

220
00:12:31,503 --> 00:12:33,027
I'll take this.

221
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,775
- My dad never gave me enough toys anyway.
- I am not in the elephant business.

222
00:12:37,843 --> 00:12:40,368
You ain't much of a lawyer either.
This can't be legal.

223
00:12:40,446 --> 00:12:41,879
Signed and witnessed.

224
00:12:41,947 --> 00:12:44,814
I was misled. I am not responsible.

225
00:12:44,883 --> 00:12:46,350
And I am out of here.

226
00:12:46,418 --> 00:12:48,181
You'll be hearing from my mother.

227
00:12:48,253 --> 00:12:50,346
Mr. Corcoran, I love litigation.

228
00:12:55,994 --> 00:12:58,519
It's out again. Get off the street.

229
00:13:00,499 --> 00:13:02,729
It's yours! It's him!

230
00:13:02,801 --> 00:13:04,428
It's that elephant man!

231
00:13:04,503 --> 00:13:06,027
It should be in a zoo.

232
00:13:06,605 --> 00:13:09,506
- Hope you got insurance, pal.
- You should both be in a zoo.

233
00:13:09,575 --> 00:13:11,008
Take it out of here!

234
00:13:11,076 --> 00:13:12,737
Get it out of here.

235
00:13:13,445 --> 00:13:15,276
Nice town, nice people.

236
00:13:43,108 --> 00:13:44,666
Move or die!

237
00:13:48,714 --> 00:13:50,181
Heads up!

238
00:14:16,241 --> 00:14:17,765
Stay!

239
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:19,809
Sit!

240
00:14:43,502 --> 00:14:47,632
In the park, multiple citizen reports of
an elephant running loose...

241
00:14:48,006 --> 00:14:51,305
- You're gonna have to get your elephant out.
- It's not my elephant.

242
00:14:51,543 --> 00:14:53,943
I was defrauded.
I want to lodge a complaint.

243
00:14:54,246 --> 00:14:56,043
Look, you weasel-faced shyster.

244
00:14:57,382 --> 00:14:58,576
Come on out.

245
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:01,949
If you don't take charge of that elephant,
you're going to jail.

246
00:15:02,354 --> 00:15:06,051
I've got to make speeches in Modesto,
Tampa, and New Orleans.

247
00:15:06,124 --> 00:15:08,388
I've got an apartment with a no-pet clause.

248
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:11,827
I'll slap a lien on that
and garnish your fees for those speeches.

249
00:15:11,897 --> 00:15:14,991
And if you don't pay me $35,000 in 14 days...

250
00:15:15,067 --> 00:15:17,501
...you might as well
pitch a tent in our courtroom.

251
00:15:17,569 --> 00:15:21,335
You well-dressed worm, get outta there.
Slide outta there, will you, please?

252
00:15:22,274 --> 00:15:25,801
Folks in this town used to think
we hated New Yorkers more than anything.

253
00:15:25,877 --> 00:15:28,311
Now they run a close second to elephants.

254
00:15:34,586 --> 00:15:35,814
Not now.

255
00:15:38,457 --> 00:15:40,084
It's your mommy.

256
00:15:43,395 --> 00:15:45,727
Is there any way I could get back to you?

257
00:15:46,031 --> 00:15:48,966
No, you don't know him. He's a new friend.

258
00:15:49,468 --> 00:15:50,958
I've gotta go.

259
00:15:59,244 --> 00:16:01,269
I believe your elephant likes you.

260
00:16:01,346 --> 00:16:04,247
I believe you remind that elephant
of your old man.

261
00:16:05,484 --> 00:16:09,818
- Didn't my father leave instructions for this?
- Ask the well-dressed worm.

262
00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:12,949
Here's the will, for what it's worth.

263
00:16:14,893 --> 00:16:16,019
What's its name?

264
00:16:17,262 --> 00:16:18,388
Vera.

265
00:16:20,465 --> 00:16:21,762
My God.

266
00:16:23,035 --> 00:16:25,230
He named it after my mother.

267
00:16:29,241 --> 00:16:31,766
"To Jackie.
I know I haven't been the best father."

268
00:16:32,044 --> 00:16:35,502
Dad, shouldn't this read,
"I've been no father at all"?

269
00:16:36,848 --> 00:16:39,282
"But do me one favor, son." Sure.

270
00:16:39,818 --> 00:16:41,718
"Take care of her.

271
00:16:42,287 --> 00:16:43,515
"If stuck...

272
00:16:44,122 --> 00:16:45,487
"...call Blockhead.

273
00:16:46,325 --> 00:16:47,383
"K.C."

274
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:48,858
That's a nice touch.

275
00:16:48,927 --> 00:16:52,294
Last words to me,
and you sign off with your initials.

276
00:16:53,432 --> 00:16:55,866
"Call Blockhead."
What's that supposed to mean?

277
00:16:55,934 --> 00:16:58,835
Call Vera "Blockhead"? Blockhead.

278
00:16:59,004 --> 00:17:00,869
Don't get huffy, now, that was...

279
00:17:00,939 --> 00:17:03,840
...Dad's sole piece of advice.

280
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:08,208
Where would you dump an elephant?
The zoo.

281
00:17:13,185 --> 00:17:14,846
Yes, information?

282
00:17:15,354 --> 00:17:17,322
Can I have the number of the local...

283
00:17:17,522 --> 00:17:18,750
Hey.

284
00:17:23,729 --> 00:17:26,698
He taught you that one? Very nice little trick.

285
00:17:27,165 --> 00:17:29,030
All right, wise guy, give it to me.

286
00:17:36,575 --> 00:17:37,564
Give it to me.

287
00:17:42,914 --> 00:17:44,438
Okay. All right.

288
00:17:44,783 --> 00:17:47,343
Put it down now. Step on it.

289
00:17:54,025 --> 00:17:55,822
What is your problem?

290
00:18:07,005 --> 00:18:07,994
Great.

291
00:18:09,174 --> 00:18:10,903
Come on. Let's go.

292
00:18:13,745 --> 00:18:14,837
Hey!

293
00:18:16,114 --> 00:18:18,082
Wait up. Wait up there.

294
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:26,951
I saw your show.

295
00:18:27,225 --> 00:18:28,522
It's not my show.

296
00:18:28,593 --> 00:18:29,855
You're not the clown?

297
00:18:30,128 --> 00:18:31,527
He was my...

298
00:18:32,631 --> 00:18:34,394
Could you direct me to the local zoo?

299
00:18:34,466 --> 00:18:38,232
You should've seen that clown get it
to do tricks with different whistles.

300
00:18:38,303 --> 00:18:39,634
Whistles?

301
00:18:39,838 --> 00:18:40,930
Stop!

302
00:18:41,673 --> 00:18:42,935
Find a pay phone.

303
00:18:43,175 --> 00:18:45,166
The zoo's a couple of miles from here.

304
00:18:45,477 --> 00:18:46,705
Really?

305
00:18:47,045 --> 00:18:48,740
I don't have the space here.

306
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,207
My mission is small animals.

307
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:54,783
Haven't you ever seen a petting zoo before?

308
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,385
Is that yours? Could you get it off me?

309
00:18:57,456 --> 00:19:00,892
- Johnny, shoo.
- Get off of me.

310
00:19:04,863 --> 00:19:06,194
Throw something bigger.

311
00:19:07,365 --> 00:19:08,389
Thank you.

312
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,092
Can you recommend a facility
that takes animals of this size?

313
00:19:16,374 --> 00:19:18,706
$300 is what pops into my mind.

314
00:19:19,344 --> 00:19:22,541
$300? That's a little steep for one night,
don't you think?

315
00:19:24,449 --> 00:19:25,609
Compared to what?

316
00:19:26,418 --> 00:19:27,783
Compared to the Ritz.

317
00:19:29,287 --> 00:19:30,652
So, go there.

318
00:20:09,794 --> 00:20:12,661
Back roads all across the country.

319
00:20:13,498 --> 00:20:14,487
What a life.

320
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:26,700
And that will.

321
00:20:31,049 --> 00:20:32,573
"Call Blockhead.

322
00:20:34,052 --> 00:20:35,314
"K.C."

323
00:20:35,554 --> 00:20:36,578
Hello, Mom.

324
00:20:36,821 --> 00:20:37,981
I was kidnapped.

325
00:20:38,056 --> 00:20:40,991
I just got off the phone
with Trowbridge Bowers.

326
00:20:41,059 --> 00:20:42,083
How is Mr. Bowers?

327
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:46,324
He's wondering how you were
going to come up with $35,000.

328
00:20:46,464 --> 00:20:47,624
Sell Vera for dog food.

329
00:20:47,699 --> 00:20:49,394
Is that supposed to be funny?

330
00:20:49,467 --> 00:20:53,062
- Mom, Vera is the elephant.
- My God.

331
00:20:53,338 --> 00:20:55,568
How is that supposed to make me feel?

332
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,972
Mom, in the will he mentioned somebody...

333
00:20:58,043 --> 00:20:59,510
...from Kansas City.

334
00:20:59,744 --> 00:21:04,272
Yeah, the Human Blockhead,
Vernon Sawitsky.

335
00:21:04,449 --> 00:21:05,882
The Human Blockhead?

336
00:21:06,585 --> 00:21:08,018
Be home, Vernon.

337
00:21:08,453 --> 00:21:09,442
Be home.

338
00:21:09,888 --> 00:21:11,082
Hello?

339
00:21:11,156 --> 00:21:13,784
- Hello, may I speak with Vernon, please?
- Gone to bed.

340
00:21:13,858 --> 00:21:15,155
Can I get a number?

341
00:21:15,226 --> 00:21:19,629
I'm at area code 410, Klingman 5...

342
00:21:20,065 --> 00:21:21,726
...87-56.

343
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:23,266
Who is this?

344
00:21:23,368 --> 00:21:25,598
I'm Kirby's son.

345
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:27,035
Hello!

346
00:21:27,105 --> 00:21:28,265
Hello.

347
00:21:33,044 --> 00:21:35,376
Where am I gonna find a zoo
open at this hour?

348
00:21:35,513 --> 00:21:37,413
The west coast, perhaps.

349
00:21:40,752 --> 00:21:41,844
Yeah?

350
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,581
- Mo, in Elephants?
- Yeah.

351
00:21:43,655 --> 00:21:46,351
I'm sorry, for a second there,
you sounded like a woman.

352
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:49,958
I just got an elephant all of a sudden,
and everyone...

353
00:21:50,028 --> 00:21:52,826
All the zoos say, "Talk to Mo in San Diego."

354
00:21:52,964 --> 00:21:54,226
Did Terry put you up to this?

355
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:56,859
Terry tries to snake up every
elephant that comes my way.

356
00:21:56,935 --> 00:21:58,334
Who's Terry?

357
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:01,138
Put that down.

358
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,667
Down, Vera!

359
00:22:07,212 --> 00:22:08,975
My elephant just picked up a VW Bug.

360
00:22:09,047 --> 00:22:10,207
I don't have time for this.

361
00:22:10,281 --> 00:22:12,112
You don't? Vera!

362
00:22:13,718 --> 00:22:14,742
She put it down.

363
00:22:14,819 --> 00:22:17,845
My name is Jack Corcoran,
and I just inherited an elephant...

364
00:22:17,922 --> 00:22:20,755
...from my father the clown,
and I was wondering...

365
00:22:20,892 --> 00:22:22,883
...do you know anybody
who needs an elephant?

366
00:22:22,961 --> 00:22:25,691
If you're on the level, Jack,
I happen to need one myself.

367
00:22:25,764 --> 00:22:27,026
It's none of your beeswax...

368
00:22:27,098 --> 00:22:30,431
...but on the 24th of this month
I'm sending a herd to Sri Lanka...

369
00:22:30,502 --> 00:22:32,094
...for a gene-pool experiment.

370
00:22:32,203 --> 00:22:35,969
Air Force is allowing us to piggyback
on one of their humanitarian missions.

371
00:22:36,107 --> 00:22:37,665
You got a breeding-age female?

372
00:22:37,742 --> 00:22:40,905
Well, I think she would have to be.
Her name is Vera.

373
00:22:40,979 --> 00:22:42,037
My name's Mo.

374
00:22:42,113 --> 00:22:45,742
If male elephants are anything
like male police horses, she's a female.

375
00:22:45,817 --> 00:22:48,650
Look at the bottom of her foot
and tell me if it's wrinkled.

376
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,153
How can I look at the bottom...

377
00:22:50,221 --> 00:22:53,315
If you can't, you don't have any business
being with an elephant.

378
00:22:53,391 --> 00:22:57,555
I have no business being with an elephant.
Wait a second. Hold on. I know this one.

379
00:22:58,296 --> 00:22:59,524
Vera...

380
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,731
What is your problem?

381
00:23:09,674 --> 00:23:11,505
Good. Okay. At ease.

382
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,947
It's incredibly smooth.

383
00:23:17,015 --> 00:23:20,143
Excellent! Means she's young enough
to breed. Where are you?

384
00:23:20,218 --> 00:23:21,549
I'm in a junkyard in Maryland.

385
00:23:21,619 --> 00:23:22,745
A junkyard?

386
00:23:22,887 --> 00:23:23,911
Get her out of there.

387
00:23:23,988 --> 00:23:26,081
You know what? The Hilton's all booked up.

388
00:23:26,157 --> 00:23:28,717
You bring her here,
I'll give you $30,000 for her.

389
00:23:28,793 --> 00:23:32,695
How about this? You come here and get her,
and you give me $36,000.

390
00:23:32,764 --> 00:23:35,392
- I can't go that high.
- I can't get her that far.

391
00:23:35,467 --> 00:23:37,901
- Bring her by rail.
- How am I gonna do that?

392
00:23:37,969 --> 00:23:41,097
You don't make an elephant do anything.
You treat it with respect.

393
00:23:41,172 --> 00:23:43,470
Show her that you care,
and she'll take the train.

394
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:46,009
Excuse me,
I just gotta brush away a tear here.

395
00:23:46,077 --> 00:23:48,602
Dare I ask
if you're even feeding her properly?

396
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:52,343
An elephant needs 200 pounds
of grains, fruits and vegetables a day...

397
00:23:52,417 --> 00:23:55,045
...not to mention at least 25 gallons of water.

398
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,111
Mo, I don't eat that well, okay?

399
00:23:57,188 --> 00:23:59,452
Now look, can you come up with $34,000?

400
00:23:59,524 --> 00:24:04,086
Listen to me. The herd is leaving
on the 24th, with or without her.

401
00:24:04,229 --> 00:24:06,288
I'm gonna have to entertain other offers.

402
00:24:06,364 --> 00:24:09,333
I'm probably gonna talk to Roy
of Siegfried and Roy.

403
00:24:10,068 --> 00:24:11,160
Hello?

404
00:24:12,537 --> 00:24:14,767
Pleasure chatting, Mo.

405
00:24:19,077 --> 00:24:20,738
Be my friend, please.

406
00:24:26,885 --> 00:24:28,512
No, come on back.

407
00:24:28,653 --> 00:24:31,213
Come on back, Mr. Tough Junkyard.

408
00:24:31,856 --> 00:24:34,120
You want some of me? Stay outta this, Vera.

409
00:24:34,192 --> 00:24:35,557
Want some of me?

410
00:25:28,012 --> 00:25:29,070
Is this Vernon?

411
00:25:30,415 --> 00:25:32,110
Kirby, I declare.

412
00:25:32,784 --> 00:25:34,547
I'm sure sorry to hear that.

413
00:25:34,719 --> 00:25:37,847
I knew Kirby as well as anyone,
outside of Vera, of course.

414
00:25:37,922 --> 00:25:41,289
Don't you spill Grandpa's coffee, Baby Boop!

415
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,385
You managed to have a career and family.

416
00:25:44,462 --> 00:25:45,554
It wasn't hard.

417
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:47,860
So, can you just tell me how to handle her?

418
00:25:47,932 --> 00:25:51,629
Well, son, I couldn't begin
to show you that over the telephone.

419
00:25:51,703 --> 00:25:54,501
- Why don't you come see us in Kansas City?
- Come see you?

420
00:25:54,739 --> 00:25:58,573
I'll tell you what. If I'm in Kansas City,
I definitely will come and see you.

421
00:25:58,643 --> 00:26:00,736
Say hi to Mrs. Blockhead.

422
00:26:02,447 --> 00:26:05,439
She didn't break your fence.
She leaned on it.

423
00:26:06,084 --> 00:26:08,882
And your dog doesn't have a scratch on it.

424
00:26:11,489 --> 00:26:13,286
Yeah, but his spirit's broke.

425
00:26:13,358 --> 00:26:17,226
At the age of 32, this one man,
Anthony Robbins...

426
00:26:17,295 --> 00:26:21,527
...has helped over a million people
dramatically improve their lives.

427
00:26:21,633 --> 00:26:23,328
Recognized by Time...

428
00:26:23,401 --> 00:26:24,959
The guy changed my life.

429
00:26:27,071 --> 00:26:30,871
Too bad. There's a sign,
"No shoes, no shirt, no service."

430
00:26:30,942 --> 00:26:32,637
Just deal with it, okay?

431
00:26:35,346 --> 00:26:36,711
All right.

432
00:26:37,081 --> 00:26:38,844
Stop when you get to 25 gallons.

433
00:26:39,984 --> 00:26:41,417
That's one.

434
00:26:43,321 --> 00:26:45,516
- How much is your salad bar?
- $4.95.

435
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:49,117
I mean, the entire salad bar.
Your lunch crowd is over anyway, right?

436
00:26:53,564 --> 00:26:54,758
To go, please.

437
00:26:55,433 --> 00:26:56,866
There you go.

438
00:27:00,305 --> 00:27:02,899
Touch the lettuce please, don't touch me.

439
00:27:03,574 --> 00:27:04,768
Don't touch me!

440
00:27:29,734 --> 00:27:32,396
- You the guy who called about the elephant?
- Elephant?

441
00:27:36,174 --> 00:27:37,471
Yeah.

442
00:27:37,542 --> 00:27:42,172
That's great. That is wonderful.
But that is not what I asked for.

443
00:27:42,246 --> 00:27:45,409
Put your nose down,
and come on up into the car.

444
00:27:45,483 --> 00:27:49,749
Here's Kirby's trunk. Come on, let's go.
On three. One, two, three.

445
00:27:52,223 --> 00:27:53,281
No.

446
00:27:53,691 --> 00:27:54,988
No, God!

447
00:27:55,059 --> 00:28:00,019
No, this is not the right thing.
This is the wrong thing. We did this already.

448
00:28:00,098 --> 00:28:03,761
No, don't sit down.
Please, don't sit down. Please.

449
00:28:03,835 --> 00:28:07,566
No, don't sit down. Stand up.
You can sit down in the car.

450
00:28:08,272 --> 00:28:09,830
Come on. God.

451
00:28:09,907 --> 00:28:12,842
Well, clip my mane, and call me baldy.

452
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:14,901
What is this here?

453
00:28:16,781 --> 00:28:18,749
What does this here look like?

454
00:28:19,417 --> 00:28:21,282
This here is an elephant.

455
00:28:22,553 --> 00:28:24,521
Dead? Not on my train.

456
00:28:24,589 --> 00:28:27,683
She's not dead. She's just stubborn.
She's just impossible.

457
00:28:29,093 --> 00:28:33,189
Get up, dammit. Get up, Vera.

458
00:28:34,465 --> 00:28:37,764
- Your train? Who are you?
- Hurst.

459
00:28:38,002 --> 00:28:39,629
And I haven't approved this.

460
00:28:39,704 --> 00:28:41,569
But I called and arranged everything.

461
00:28:41,639 --> 00:28:43,334
You arranged with the local fellow.

462
00:28:43,408 --> 00:28:46,104
You didn't arrange with the train, or with me.

463
00:28:46,277 --> 00:28:50,941
You want me to be responsible for a tipped-
over elephant, all the way to San Diego?

464
00:28:51,682 --> 00:28:52,671
First...

465
00:28:53,618 --> 00:28:55,745
...she's not gonna stay tipped over.

466
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,185
So you say.

467
00:28:58,956 --> 00:29:02,084
- Second...
- Every state line has laws and inspections.

468
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,890
Which means at every state line,
my job is on the line.

469
00:29:05,496 --> 00:29:10,229
I get fired now, my pension's only $13,500.
I make it to retirement, and it's $28,000.

470
00:29:10,301 --> 00:29:13,361
Take that, and factor in all this... Let's see.

471
00:29:13,438 --> 00:29:17,169
Kansas, Colorado, Nevada, and that's...

472
00:29:17,375 --> 00:29:18,808
$2,600!

473
00:29:20,378 --> 00:29:22,938
Now, you got 30 seconds, friend.

474
00:29:23,014 --> 00:29:24,311
We're gonna roll...

475
00:29:24,649 --> 00:29:26,412
...with him or without him.

476
00:29:26,851 --> 00:29:28,876
- It's a her.
- I don't care what it is.

477
00:29:28,953 --> 00:29:30,887
It don't make me no never mind.

478
00:29:30,955 --> 00:29:32,718
I've got $600 in cash.

479
00:29:33,091 --> 00:29:34,217
To San Diego?

480
00:29:34,425 --> 00:29:36,825
With an elephant manifestly uncontrollable?

481
00:29:36,894 --> 00:29:39,829
Why didn't you learn how to manage her
before this trip?

482
00:29:39,897 --> 00:29:41,694
What about Kansas City?

483
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,593
Well, I don't know.

484
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,328
All right.

485
00:29:47,405 --> 00:29:49,100
If you two hustle in there, right now.

486
00:29:49,173 --> 00:29:51,539
- Not me. I'm flying.
- No.

487
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:55,278
Unaccompanied elephant would be...

488
00:29:55,446 --> 00:29:57,277
...twice the risk.

489
00:30:02,086 --> 00:30:04,953
- I'll ride with her in the boxcar.
- I thought so.

490
00:30:09,193 --> 00:30:11,184
She seems to like you.

491
00:30:12,997 --> 00:30:16,125
You keep that door
near about closed, Colonel. Charlie!

492
00:30:16,934 --> 00:30:20,199
'Cause anybody sees you two,
you're walkin' the tracks.

493
00:30:30,348 --> 00:30:31,610
I hate you.

494
00:30:41,792 --> 00:30:44,192
This is a funny joke, Dad.

495
00:30:49,934 --> 00:30:51,663
You think this is funny?

496
00:31:19,497 --> 00:31:20,794
Quick, hide.

497
00:31:25,036 --> 00:31:26,094
Hey.

498
00:31:33,844 --> 00:31:35,368
We're comin' into St. Louis.

499
00:31:35,446 --> 00:31:37,380
Be in K.C. in the morning.

500
00:31:38,382 --> 00:31:39,474
Here.

501
00:31:45,423 --> 00:31:46,788
Late night snack.

502
00:31:46,991 --> 00:31:48,185
That'll be $10.

503
00:31:51,028 --> 00:31:52,052
No.

504
00:31:57,068 --> 00:32:00,196
I thought you were probably
holdin' back a little cash on me.

505
00:32:01,005 --> 00:32:03,064
Then I began to "D," deliberate.

506
00:32:03,908 --> 00:32:06,240
- You what?
- I recognized you right away.

507
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:08,175
You addressed our union convention.

508
00:32:08,246 --> 00:32:12,114
I never thought of working
these little sidelines till after I heard you talk.

509
00:32:12,717 --> 00:32:14,617
You make me very proud.

510
00:32:31,636 --> 00:32:34,161
I don't know about you, but I'm gettin' off.

511
00:32:36,774 --> 00:32:38,173
Excuse me, fellas.

512
00:32:38,242 --> 00:32:41,473
Can you tell me where there's
a cesspool I can scrub up in?

513
00:32:47,618 --> 00:32:51,076
- Kirby's boy, step right up.
- My God.

514
00:32:51,322 --> 00:32:52,812
Step right up.

515
00:33:00,298 --> 00:33:01,663
Hello, there.

516
00:33:02,099 --> 00:33:04,567
Hello. How ya doin'?

517
00:33:04,635 --> 00:33:06,899
How're you makin' out, Vera?

518
00:33:06,971 --> 00:33:10,566
My goodness gracious,
it's so good to see you.

519
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:13,602
There you go.

520
00:33:14,178 --> 00:33:15,372
Good girl.

521
00:33:16,514 --> 00:33:17,947
That's the way they are.

522
00:33:18,082 --> 00:33:20,710
That's how they greet people,
how they greet each other.

523
00:33:20,785 --> 00:33:22,377
They sniff each other out.

524
00:33:22,453 --> 00:33:24,182
Don't worry though, I just shake hands.

525
00:33:26,157 --> 00:33:28,990
I would've known you for Kirby's boy.

526
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:32,518
Except Kirby always prided himself
on neatness.

527
00:33:37,134 --> 00:33:38,328
Walter, I'll make Modesto.

528
00:33:38,402 --> 00:33:42,361
You better make Modesto, I swear to God.
My ass is hanging out there.

529
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,533
I got three days. I'll work it out.

530
00:33:44,608 --> 00:33:45,734
I need the money.

531
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:47,801
- Who doesn't need the money?
- More than ever.

532
00:33:47,878 --> 00:33:50,210
Don't turn your back on New Orleans.
We need it!

533
00:33:50,281 --> 00:33:52,249
Jack, this is my wife, Luluna.

534
00:33:52,883 --> 00:33:56,250
Your washables are drying.
I did what I could with your suit.

535
00:33:56,887 --> 00:33:58,980
Why don't you sit? Here, on the couch.

536
00:33:59,924 --> 00:34:02,085
You won't get any circus cooties.

537
00:34:04,962 --> 00:34:07,294
He's as particular as his mother.

538
00:34:07,665 --> 00:34:08,689
You look beat.

539
00:34:09,266 --> 00:34:11,860
Why don't you stay with us
for a couple of days?

540
00:34:12,436 --> 00:34:13,562
I have to get going.

541
00:34:13,637 --> 00:34:16,231
I wouldn't want you to think
all we eat is sandwiches.

542
00:34:16,307 --> 00:34:18,775
Anything you serve up
goes down with a bang.

543
00:34:18,843 --> 00:34:23,803
And that comes from a man that ate fire,
steel and something you rarely see.

544
00:34:23,981 --> 00:34:26,472
I stick a spoon up this nostril,
a fork up this one.

545
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:30,247
- Now, my sinuses were just...
- Vernon. He doesn't want to hear shop talk.

546
00:34:32,223 --> 00:34:35,920
- He wants to know about his father.
- I want to know how to deal with Vera.

547
00:34:35,993 --> 00:34:37,392
There he is.

548
00:34:38,963 --> 00:34:40,453
It was old...

549
00:34:40,731 --> 00:34:42,358
...so I decoupaged it.

550
00:34:42,433 --> 00:34:44,697
If I'd let her, she'd decoupage me.

551
00:34:45,569 --> 00:34:46,627
There's Dad.

552
00:34:47,805 --> 00:34:50,171
Right below the fat lady
and above the dancing bear.

553
00:34:50,241 --> 00:34:52,539
Your dad didn't have Vera
when he met your mother.

554
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:54,737
Some town in New York State.

555
00:34:55,713 --> 00:34:58,011
Brockport. She was in college.

556
00:35:00,284 --> 00:35:03,048
You know,
she told me a story that he saved a kid's life.

557
00:35:03,254 --> 00:35:05,245
Well, he was a fireman in the act.

558
00:35:05,322 --> 00:35:09,156
You know, fire truck, clowns in and out,
they'd toss this baby doll around.

559
00:35:09,226 --> 00:35:11,820
Your mother used to travel with us.
Took tickets.

560
00:35:11,896 --> 00:35:14,831
- It looked like she was becoming one of us.
- She had you.

561
00:35:14,899 --> 00:35:16,867
Then she was gone. She and you.

562
00:35:17,268 --> 00:35:19,395
Kirby left us for several years and...

563
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:21,995
...then he came back, with Vera.

564
00:35:23,874 --> 00:35:26,900
Performing is when your dad let himself go.

565
00:35:26,977 --> 00:35:29,309
Him and Vera were some act.

566
00:35:29,647 --> 00:35:32,980
I mean, he trained her himself.
I don't know how he knew how.

567
00:35:33,417 --> 00:35:35,749
Hello there, sir. Thank you very much.

568
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,651
- Thank you very much, sir.
- Vernon!

569
00:35:37,721 --> 00:35:40,781
- What?
- Don't influence the children.

570
00:35:41,091 --> 00:35:42,615
You wanna see my scrapbook?

571
00:35:42,693 --> 00:35:44,490
No, thank you.

572
00:35:49,066 --> 00:35:50,090
There he is.

573
00:35:50,401 --> 00:35:54,497
- What's that thing he's holding?
- That's a back-scratcher. She responds to it.

574
00:35:54,572 --> 00:35:56,631
She does? I've got this thing in the trunk.

575
00:35:56,707 --> 00:36:00,370
Well, you show her that, she'll lead
right along. If you got a feel for her.

576
00:36:00,544 --> 00:36:01,806
Wow, what is that?

577
00:36:02,146 --> 00:36:04,239
That's the trick that made Vera famous.

578
00:36:04,315 --> 00:36:06,613
She'd push a calliope uphill, all by herself.

579
00:36:06,684 --> 00:36:08,083
She always led the parade.

580
00:36:08,152 --> 00:36:10,814
Only elephant in the world
that can walk on her hind legs.

581
00:36:10,888 --> 00:36:13,652
All right, I really gotta get going.
This has been great.

582
00:36:15,226 --> 00:36:17,490
I forgot that was in there.

583
00:36:17,561 --> 00:36:20,826
Luluna and your dad were engaged
before your mom came along.

584
00:36:21,665 --> 00:36:25,101
Don't worry.
You wouldn't have been born tattooed.

585
00:36:26,604 --> 00:36:28,071
I wasn't thinking that.

586
00:36:29,073 --> 00:36:30,370
She can salute.

587
00:36:35,946 --> 00:36:37,470
She knows how to skip.

588
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:42,816
How about that?

589
00:36:42,887 --> 00:36:44,115
She skips better than I do.

590
00:36:44,188 --> 00:36:45,519
Take a bow.

591
00:36:49,426 --> 00:36:52,691
Well, what about the hard stuff,
like "go, stop."

592
00:36:52,997 --> 00:36:54,897
Simplicity itself.

593
00:36:55,165 --> 00:36:56,154
Go.

594
00:37:02,273 --> 00:37:03,399
Stop.

595
00:37:05,175 --> 00:37:06,972
Why, she's a treasure.

596
00:37:07,111 --> 00:37:08,772
Jack, you try.

597
00:37:12,416 --> 00:37:14,316
Here. Yeah. Come on.

598
00:37:15,853 --> 00:37:17,081
All right.

599
00:37:17,688 --> 00:37:18,677
Go.

600
00:37:24,695 --> 00:37:27,459
She's messing with me now.
Come on, let's try it again.

601
00:37:27,565 --> 00:37:28,896
Go.

602
00:37:29,433 --> 00:37:30,457
No.

603
00:37:31,101 --> 00:37:32,830
Stop.

604
00:37:33,337 --> 00:37:34,668
No, the other stop.

605
00:37:34,872 --> 00:37:36,840
You just need to get a feel for each other.

606
00:37:36,907 --> 00:37:39,671
Once you're sure you know what she wants,
she'll do it.

607
00:37:40,678 --> 00:37:43,579
What about the famous trick?
The one that my dad did with her.

608
00:37:43,647 --> 00:37:45,945
She wouldn't do that for nobody
but your dad.

609
00:37:48,586 --> 00:37:50,520
We'll give it a try.

610
00:37:54,758 --> 00:37:56,953
I guess that trick died with your dad.

611
00:37:57,628 --> 00:38:00,461
What are you gonna do?
Work up an act, take her on the road?

612
00:38:00,531 --> 00:38:02,726
No, I'm gonna free her.

613
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,160
- Free her?
- Mercy.

614
00:38:04,368 --> 00:38:07,701
There's a woman at the San Diego Zoo
taking elephants to Sri Lanka...

615
00:38:07,771 --> 00:38:10,569
Sri Lanka? Who would she know there?

616
00:38:10,641 --> 00:38:12,404
She'd get to live in the rain forest.

617
00:38:12,476 --> 00:38:14,910
Rain forest?
That's just another word for jungle.

618
00:38:14,979 --> 00:38:17,106
They're gonna give me $30,000.

619
00:38:17,181 --> 00:38:20,878
I know this outfit in Hollywood,
give you a lot more than $30,000 for her.

620
00:38:21,485 --> 00:38:22,952
They'd make Vera a star.

621
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,612
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.

622
00:38:24,688 --> 00:38:27,156
You need to appreciate your dad's
way of life more.

623
00:38:27,224 --> 00:38:29,317
I'm gonna drive you out there in the vehicle.

624
00:38:29,393 --> 00:38:31,588
- Now, Vernon!
- Now, don't "Now, Vernon" me.

625
00:38:31,662 --> 00:38:33,254
I gotta change my clothes.

626
00:38:51,048 --> 00:38:53,380
Aye, this is the life, ain't it?

627
00:38:53,717 --> 00:38:56,481
We'll stop along the road someplace,
put on a show.

628
00:38:56,620 --> 00:39:00,454
Like your dad always said,
"If you ain't on the road, you're in a rut."

629
00:39:02,993 --> 00:39:06,326
What about these people in LA?
You think we should call them first?

630
00:39:06,397 --> 00:39:10,697
Gotta deal with these people face-to-face,
or they'll take us for rubes, bumpkins...

631
00:39:10,768 --> 00:39:12,065
...suckers from the sticks.

632
00:39:12,136 --> 00:39:13,626
I'll do the negotiating.

633
00:39:13,871 --> 00:39:17,307
One time, I traded a blind lion...

634
00:39:17,374 --> 00:39:19,103
...for a flatbed truck...

635
00:39:19,243 --> 00:39:21,973
...ten dancing chickens and a trampoline.

636
00:39:24,214 --> 00:39:25,738
That noise, what was that?

637
00:39:26,784 --> 00:39:30,481
See, our polar bear got arrested
for breaking and entering.

638
00:39:30,554 --> 00:39:32,920
Wasn't really a polar bear per se.

639
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:37,791
What we done was, we took this
regular bear, and we bleached him.

640
00:39:45,436 --> 00:39:47,165
Are we on fire?

641
00:40:11,495 --> 00:40:14,555
Last time you took off,
you got three miles further.

642
00:40:15,165 --> 00:40:17,429
Let's take you back to the barn, Vernon.

643
00:40:23,607 --> 00:40:25,632
Jack, darling, I called Polk City.

644
00:40:25,709 --> 00:40:28,803
It's about eight miles ahead.
There's a truck-rental yard there.

645
00:40:28,879 --> 00:40:32,110
- Wish we could drive you both.
- Thanks for everything, Luluna.

646
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:35,948
If you could just give me the name.

647
00:40:36,019 --> 00:40:37,748
Yeah.

648
00:40:39,423 --> 00:40:41,220
Don't send her to the jungle.

649
00:40:41,525 --> 00:40:44,016
She doesn't get along with monkeys.

650
00:40:44,294 --> 00:40:45,591
Who does?

651
00:40:45,662 --> 00:40:48,187
Another thing your dad always said:

652
00:40:48,532 --> 00:40:51,831
"Everywhere you go, every line of work...

653
00:40:52,169 --> 00:40:53,932
"...there're two kinds of people.

654
00:40:54,004 --> 00:40:55,904
"There's the carnies and the rubes."

655
00:40:56,306 --> 00:40:58,433
Don't be on the rubes' side, kid.

656
00:40:58,509 --> 00:41:00,306
Don't live the life of a rube.

657
00:41:11,321 --> 00:41:12,652
Wanna go for a walk?

658
00:41:12,823 --> 00:41:17,192
I've got this Wall-Applications Gala
in three days.

659
00:41:17,261 --> 00:41:20,196
How am I going to make that?
What's the carny move here?

660
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,898
Now, you better be worth a lot of money.

661
00:41:26,103 --> 00:41:28,663
That's a $2,000 gig.

662
00:41:28,739 --> 00:41:32,175
I've gotta call Walter and make excuses.
I hate that.

663
00:41:34,044 --> 00:41:35,773
You're probably right.

664
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,710
Heck with Walter. He's a rube.

665
00:41:42,553 --> 00:41:43,577
Stay.

666
00:41:44,588 --> 00:41:47,557
Don't frighten the straights. Come on, stay.

667
00:41:47,758 --> 00:41:50,556
Don't frighten the squares. Come on, stay.

668
00:41:53,497 --> 00:41:55,658
I need a truck quick. Stay.

669
00:41:56,867 --> 00:41:58,892
That'll be two major credit cards.

670
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:01,459
Stop.

671
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:04,298
That's to stop. Stop it.

672
00:42:04,374 --> 00:42:05,898
And a trucker's license.

673
00:42:05,976 --> 00:42:08,706
That's what the hijackers took first.
That's how they work.

674
00:42:08,779 --> 00:42:10,371
No license, no truck.

675
00:42:10,447 --> 00:42:14,577
Do you think I'd be going across Kansas
on foot with an elephant?

676
00:42:15,052 --> 00:42:17,816
They took my rig, bro!

677
00:42:21,191 --> 00:42:24,092
All right. And I'll take...

678
00:42:24,528 --> 00:42:25,825
...this.

679
00:42:26,463 --> 00:42:28,192
I'll need more to go.

680
00:42:28,332 --> 00:42:30,061
This is a nice one.

681
00:42:30,534 --> 00:42:32,559
- No.
- This is a sweet one.

682
00:42:33,036 --> 00:42:34,264
Yeah, no.

683
00:42:34,371 --> 00:42:35,429
How 'bout a pick-up?

684
00:42:35,505 --> 00:42:38,235
That's a little small, I think, don't you?

685
00:42:38,876 --> 00:42:40,810
Hey, I got one over here you'd like.

686
00:42:40,878 --> 00:42:43,676
Isn't this the truck here?

687
00:42:44,581 --> 00:42:46,310
That one's got a loose seat.

688
00:42:47,584 --> 00:42:49,916
I've handled loose seats before.

689
00:42:52,289 --> 00:42:53,779
I'll take her.

690
00:44:18,275 --> 00:44:19,537
Come on.

691
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,754
Learn to drive, you son of a bitch!

692
00:45:11,395 --> 00:45:13,124
I can't drive this.

693
00:45:24,441 --> 00:45:25,465
Help!

694
00:45:25,709 --> 00:45:27,734
Put it in the granny hole.

695
00:45:27,811 --> 00:45:29,210
Same to you.

696
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:40,087
Granny hole's first gear, birdbrain.

697
00:45:42,826 --> 00:45:44,350
Thank you.

698
00:45:55,605 --> 00:45:59,006
There ought to be a seat lever
right under your left butt-cheek.

699
00:45:59,076 --> 00:46:00,907
Just don't touch the magic button.

700
00:46:00,977 --> 00:46:02,808
Okay, thanks. Thanks again.

701
00:46:04,915 --> 00:46:06,405
What's the magic button?

702
00:46:57,767 --> 00:47:01,498
I'm sorry for everything I've ever done.

703
00:47:01,571 --> 00:47:02,595
I'm sorry.

704
00:47:02,672 --> 00:47:04,799
Help me.

705
00:47:25,195 --> 00:47:26,389
Nice rental!

706
00:47:46,416 --> 00:47:48,441
How long you think it's gonna take?

707
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:53,612
I don't know what you done
to that transmission, but...

708
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:56,056
...that truck ain't goin' nowhere
for a few weeks.

709
00:47:56,126 --> 00:47:58,594
Now, you do know how to drive a truck?

710
00:48:01,598 --> 00:48:04,294
Vera, let's go find ourselves a new rig.

711
00:48:07,904 --> 00:48:09,098
Hey, Mister...

712
00:48:09,406 --> 00:48:11,237
...you tipped this one up, too.

713
00:48:16,613 --> 00:48:20,379
Natural Talent?
Yes, may I speak with Terry Bonura, please?

714
00:48:22,219 --> 00:48:23,982
Well, when will Terry be back?

715
00:48:24,187 --> 00:48:26,485
I have to make a speech in three days.

716
00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:28,521
You heading west?

717
00:48:28,925 --> 00:48:30,051
East.

718
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:32,057
I have a highly trained elephant.

719
00:48:32,128 --> 00:48:34,358
I have a number of attractive offers for her...

720
00:48:34,431 --> 00:48:37,298
...but I want to give you people a shot.
You heading west?

721
00:48:37,667 --> 00:48:38,964
This your elephant?

722
00:48:39,636 --> 00:48:40,898
Yes, we are on foot.

723
00:48:41,271 --> 00:48:42,932
Did you just hang up on me?

724
00:48:44,541 --> 00:48:47,669
- Can you take some more cargo?
- Is he afraid of mice?

725
00:48:48,311 --> 00:48:49,778
Are you hauling mice?

726
00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:55,875
Vera, kill.

727
00:48:59,456 --> 00:49:01,481
- Mo?
- Yeah?

728
00:49:01,558 --> 00:49:02,582
Jack Corcoran.

729
00:49:02,659 --> 00:49:05,423
I got a more attractive offer for my elephant.

730
00:49:05,495 --> 00:49:08,987
- Is that right? Who from?
- Terry Bonura of Natural Talent.

731
00:49:09,065 --> 00:49:11,192
I knew you'd hook up with Terry.

732
00:49:11,268 --> 00:49:14,362
- That's the Terry you were talking about?
- Don't kid a kidder.

733
00:49:14,437 --> 00:49:15,426
Do the right thing.

734
00:49:15,505 --> 00:49:18,963
Have your elephant at the San Diego Airport,
Tuesday the 24th, 8:00 p.m.

735
00:49:19,042 --> 00:49:22,136
This is not just an elephant.
This is a highly trained...

736
00:49:22,212 --> 00:49:24,043
...skilled, professional elephant.

737
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:26,478
I don't give a shit if she can play the banjo.

738
00:49:26,549 --> 00:49:28,949
Healthy and fertile's all I need.

739
00:49:31,488 --> 00:49:33,513
I am having a rough night.

740
00:49:34,624 --> 00:49:36,717
I told you to kill.

741
00:49:42,632 --> 00:49:45,032
Hi, honey. I'm in Kansas.

742
00:49:46,403 --> 00:49:50,737
Would you call Walter and tell him
that I will not be able to make Modesto?

743
00:49:54,177 --> 00:49:55,906
I know that.

744
00:49:56,346 --> 00:50:00,373
I will definitely make the last two dates,
especially New Orleans.

745
00:50:01,284 --> 00:50:02,615
Sure I miss you.

746
00:50:11,194 --> 00:50:12,559
Headed west?

747
00:50:13,663 --> 00:50:14,891
Sweet dreams.

748
00:50:15,265 --> 00:50:16,789
Okay, bye-bye.

749
00:50:22,172 --> 00:50:24,106
- Give me Terry Bonura.
- You've got her.

750
00:50:24,174 --> 00:50:25,698
And who is this?

751
00:50:26,009 --> 00:50:27,738
- Terry?
- Hold on a sec.

752
00:50:27,811 --> 00:50:29,904
Your thighs, kind of ivory.

753
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:33,713
But make sure you get it
all the way up to the thong mark.

754
00:50:33,783 --> 00:50:35,910
Remember what happened last time.

755
00:50:36,086 --> 00:50:37,178
Sorry about that.

756
00:50:37,554 --> 00:50:38,816
I was...

757
00:50:38,955 --> 00:50:40,252
...expecting a man.

758
00:50:40,323 --> 00:50:41,756
Are you terribly crushed?

759
00:50:42,726 --> 00:50:44,660
- I'm Jack Corcoran.
- Are you an Aries?

760
00:50:44,994 --> 00:50:47,155
- Pisces.
- Pisces?

761
00:50:47,564 --> 00:50:49,259
You sound so firm.

762
00:50:50,967 --> 00:50:53,527
I have a rather large elephant here.

763
00:50:53,737 --> 00:50:55,705
Not every man can say that.

764
00:50:56,573 --> 00:51:00,031
And she's talented, very trained, and...

765
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:03,973
...Mo at the San Diego Zoo says that
she'd like to take her to Sri Lanka.

766
00:51:04,047 --> 00:51:07,244
Well, that's just because she can't
get anyone else to go with her.

767
00:51:07,784 --> 00:51:09,046
Can you call me back?

768
00:51:09,386 --> 00:51:12,947
Sure. But what kind of a dollar figure
would we be talking about here?

769
00:51:13,022 --> 00:51:15,081
Mo had offered $30,000.

770
00:51:15,392 --> 00:51:18,190
Well, I can do at least $40,000.

771
00:51:18,795 --> 00:51:20,854
Are you sure you're not an Aries?

772
00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:22,588
Well, I'm on the cusp.

773
00:51:22,665 --> 00:51:26,032
You're on the cusp,
and you're too modest to admit it.

774
00:51:26,569 --> 00:51:29,163
That's very sweet. Call me back, okay?

775
00:51:29,572 --> 00:51:30,834
- Okay.
- Don't forget.

776
00:51:30,907 --> 00:51:32,670
- See ya.
- Okay.

777
00:51:34,978 --> 00:51:36,138
I must be in love.

778
00:51:36,279 --> 00:51:38,406
I just lied about my sign.

779
00:51:40,550 --> 00:51:42,450
How are we gonna get to California?

780
00:51:44,187 --> 00:51:47,315
All right, I want you to wait here.

781
00:52:15,751 --> 00:52:16,979
Coffee.

782
00:52:17,687 --> 00:52:19,450
And scrambled eggs.

783
00:52:19,722 --> 00:52:21,883
Bacon, sausage, or ham?

784
00:52:22,792 --> 00:52:24,020
Sausage.

785
00:52:28,097 --> 00:52:30,964
- You know what you just ordered, don't you?
- The Bob Hope.

786
00:52:31,167 --> 00:52:32,794
Government waste.

787
00:52:33,536 --> 00:52:34,867
School-lunch program.

788
00:52:35,104 --> 00:52:36,765
Kids don't eat that free lunch.

789
00:52:36,839 --> 00:52:40,036
You got some retard come down
and suckin' on the government teat.

790
00:52:40,109 --> 00:52:42,043
Come and scrape it off the garbage cans.

791
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:44,409
Then the pig farmers slop their hogs with it.

792
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:47,938
Then shoot 'em up with every
antibiotic known to man.

793
00:52:48,150 --> 00:52:51,517
'Cause the AMA's in on this, too. Yeah.

794
00:52:51,587 --> 00:52:54,283
You think they want us healthy?
Better think again.

795
00:52:54,357 --> 00:52:56,621
- Would you help me?
- No, they don't.

796
00:52:56,859 --> 00:52:58,793
They grind that stuff up and call it meat.

797
00:52:58,861 --> 00:53:00,761
Come on. You ever seen a pig's pecker?

798
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:02,957
Shaped like a doggone corkscrew.

799
00:53:03,032 --> 00:53:04,624
It's like that. Like a corkscrew.

800
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:08,727
And that's exactly what they're tryin'
to do to you every time you eat that pork.

801
00:53:10,039 --> 00:53:11,267
Serious.

802
00:53:14,977 --> 00:53:18,037
Anytime now, that phone right there's
gonna ring-a-ding-ding.

803
00:53:18,247 --> 00:53:21,739
I'm gonna skip on across town,
pick me up a load of bowlin' pins.

804
00:53:21,817 --> 00:53:24,081
Head clear west to California.

805
00:53:24,153 --> 00:53:27,145
Yeah. Hey, my name's Tip. We ain't met yet.

806
00:53:29,258 --> 00:53:30,418
T-l-P, Tip.

807
00:53:30,726 --> 00:53:34,685
Call me that, 'cause you stick with me
you'll get a few for free, as you can see.

808
00:53:36,132 --> 00:53:38,532
Yo, sweetie, hit me again, baby, come on.

809
00:53:43,873 --> 00:53:47,138
You know how long that pig
will stay in your system if you eat it?

810
00:53:47,576 --> 00:53:48,838
I'll be right back.

811
00:53:48,911 --> 00:53:52,403
12 to 16 years.

812
00:53:54,717 --> 00:53:57,242
Come on, now. Hey, don't eat that stuff.

813
00:53:57,319 --> 00:53:58,718
Don't do it.

814
00:54:00,122 --> 00:54:01,749
What do you think's in there?

815
00:54:01,824 --> 00:54:04,816
You think it's doggone blueberries,
don't you?

816
00:54:05,828 --> 00:54:07,523
Tip-Top Truckin', Tip speakin'.

817
00:54:07,830 --> 00:54:11,994
Yeah, that, bowling-pin load,
we're gonna have to cancel that.

818
00:54:12,067 --> 00:54:12,965
Cancel it?

819
00:54:13,769 --> 00:54:15,760
- Termites.
- Termites?

820
00:54:17,139 --> 00:54:18,834
Termites, my ass.

821
00:54:18,908 --> 00:54:20,273
I know who's behind this.

822
00:54:20,342 --> 00:54:23,607
Them butt-buddies at the trucking
commission. That's who. Hello?

823
00:54:23,813 --> 00:54:24,973
Hello?

824
00:54:29,785 --> 00:54:31,548
Now they broke my phone!

825
00:54:31,987 --> 00:54:34,182
Break my phone, cancel my load!

826
00:54:34,256 --> 00:54:37,089
Goddoggit,
how's a man supposed to make it?

827
00:54:38,194 --> 00:54:41,061
Damn, I don't believe this. I don't believe it.

828
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:43,496
Now I got to deadhead clear to California.

829
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:45,999
Maybe I can help.

830
00:54:47,770 --> 00:54:50,671
Of course the rats are just
runnin' hog-wild around the place.

831
00:54:50,739 --> 00:54:53,435
The people are chasin' them
right into the grinder.

832
00:54:53,509 --> 00:54:55,773
Rats and excreta, you know.

833
00:54:55,945 --> 00:54:57,776
It's all meat to them.

834
00:54:57,847 --> 00:54:59,940
They got the balls to call that a hamburger?

835
00:55:00,015 --> 00:55:02,848
You better pull the other one, Uncle Sam.
Right?

836
00:55:03,052 --> 00:55:07,386
So, is an elephant a clean animal?
You know, they eat out the dirt and all.

837
00:55:09,225 --> 00:55:10,214
She's clean.

838
00:55:10,793 --> 00:55:11,851
She?

839
00:55:19,835 --> 00:55:20,824
I mean...

840
00:55:21,170 --> 00:55:23,434
...how do they do it? You know?

841
00:55:23,572 --> 00:55:26,735
Make whoopie? I cannot see a big,
old, flumpy thing like her...

842
00:55:26,809 --> 00:55:30,176
...laying back, legs up,
four tons of love coming on top of her...

843
00:55:30,246 --> 00:55:34,444
...and she's laying back just goin',
"Give it to me. Give it to me."

844
00:55:40,823 --> 00:55:44,190
That's a lot of weight to roll around.
You know what I'm talkin' about?

845
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:47,491
You know what I'm sayin'?
Come on, man. That's somethin' else.

846
00:55:47,563 --> 00:55:51,124
That's got to be a sight to see.
That is hard to picture in this old mind.

847
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:54,897
- I don't know how they do it.
- I heard that. I don't either.

848
00:55:57,540 --> 00:55:58,905
I'll tell you what.

849
00:56:03,212 --> 00:56:04,941
The Rocky Mountains.

850
00:56:05,014 --> 00:56:06,811
Clean spring water, right?

851
00:56:07,883 --> 00:56:09,646
Right. Come on.

852
00:56:09,718 --> 00:56:12,243
Government don't want the stuff clean.

853
00:56:12,721 --> 00:56:16,487
I'm gonna have to go ride in the back
with Vera for a while.

854
00:56:17,459 --> 00:56:18,551
She's lonesome.

855
00:56:20,429 --> 00:56:24,593
We got Jack and Tip in the cab on the road.
You and me, pal.

856
00:56:27,136 --> 00:56:28,933
Tip, do you ever sleep?

857
00:56:29,038 --> 00:56:30,869
Yeah, I slept last week.

858
00:56:59,068 --> 00:57:00,729
Top of the Divide.

859
00:57:02,204 --> 00:57:04,764
Did Dad ever let you get out and take a look?

860
00:57:06,208 --> 00:57:07,334
Tip Tucker. Yeah.

861
00:57:07,576 --> 00:57:09,976
At this rate, we'll be in LA tomorrow night.

862
00:57:12,448 --> 00:57:14,507
Maybe I'll go out to dinner with Terry.

863
00:57:14,750 --> 00:57:17,810
Hell, no, I didn't pick up
the bowlin' pins. What?

864
00:57:17,886 --> 00:57:20,719
Perhaps she'll have
a little elephant buddy for you.

865
00:57:21,123 --> 00:57:22,249
Oh, is that right?

866
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:25,850
Is that so?

867
00:57:32,301 --> 00:57:33,598
It doesn't look real.

868
00:57:37,106 --> 00:57:39,006
You don't do that to me.

869
00:57:39,274 --> 00:57:43,005
You don't do that to Tip Tucker
and his Tip-Top Trucking!

870
00:57:43,078 --> 00:57:44,670
Get over it. I had to do it.

871
00:57:44,747 --> 00:57:48,205
"Get over it," nothing.
You canceled my bowling pins.

872
00:57:48,283 --> 00:57:50,012
Look, a bald eagle.

873
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:52,747
There ain't no... Hey!

874
00:57:58,027 --> 00:58:00,655
- Tip, I had to do it.
- Had to do...

875
00:58:04,266 --> 00:58:08,362
Okay, look, I'm from the playground, man.
City kid. I got game.

876
00:58:08,437 --> 00:58:10,735
Watch out. Look out. Come on.

877
00:58:15,444 --> 00:58:16,433
Wait.

878
00:58:16,512 --> 00:58:18,139
Let's you and me get in the truck.

879
00:58:18,213 --> 00:58:21,011
We'll drive down 3,000 feet.
We'll do this there.

880
00:58:21,083 --> 00:58:22,482
I like it here.

881
00:58:33,829 --> 00:58:35,660
Whose playground now?

882
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:47,639
The only reason you're doing this
is 'cause I ain't popular with people.

883
00:58:48,043 --> 00:58:49,874
Don't make me feel bad about this.

884
00:59:01,056 --> 00:59:02,648
Get away from me.

885
00:59:03,392 --> 00:59:05,121
You hijacked me.

886
00:59:05,327 --> 00:59:07,488
And that animal right there tried to kill me.

887
00:59:07,563 --> 00:59:11,363
I'm gonna put the both of youse
behind bars in the state penitentiary.

888
00:59:11,433 --> 00:59:13,230
Her for attempted murderer...

889
00:59:13,302 --> 00:59:16,533
...and you for being a interstate felon.

890
00:59:16,605 --> 00:59:18,630
What do you think of that?

891
00:59:21,376 --> 00:59:25,437
Nobody does that to Tip Tucker
and gets away with it. You hear me?

892
00:59:30,085 --> 00:59:32,986
I will be back, with the law.

893
00:59:33,288 --> 00:59:35,483
With the law!

894
00:59:35,657 --> 00:59:36,646
Well...

895
00:59:36,759 --> 00:59:38,750
...we'd better change our course.

896
00:59:40,963 --> 00:59:43,625
Dad's got a southerly route marked here.

897
00:59:43,699 --> 00:59:45,894
Back roads through New Mexico.

898
00:59:47,269 --> 00:59:48,736
It's either that, or...

899
00:59:49,972 --> 00:59:51,701
...you get the chair.

900
01:00:15,197 --> 01:00:18,655
Well, we know where it'll be
if I ever come back this way.

901
01:00:40,322 --> 01:00:43,485
Okay, I've got some good news
and some bad news.

902
01:00:44,326 --> 01:00:45,452
Good news is...

903
01:00:46,361 --> 01:00:48,158
...it's all downhill from here.

904
01:00:49,031 --> 01:00:50,293
The bad news is...

905
01:00:50,899 --> 01:00:52,423
...you're gonna carry me.

906
01:00:52,968 --> 01:00:54,128
Okay.

907
01:00:55,737 --> 01:00:56,726
Hold still.

908
01:00:58,340 --> 01:00:59,432
Hey.

909
01:01:00,108 --> 01:01:01,336
All right.

910
01:01:04,546 --> 01:01:05,774
All right.

911
01:01:09,484 --> 01:01:11,816
Okay, honey, where's the stairs?

912
01:01:15,724 --> 01:01:16,918
Well...

913
01:01:21,029 --> 01:01:22,257
...does that hurt?

914
01:01:25,734 --> 01:01:26,723
All right...

915
01:01:28,737 --> 01:01:30,170
...let's try this one.

916
01:01:30,906 --> 01:01:33,898
What the heck is going on?

917
01:01:35,110 --> 01:01:36,600
Okay, hold it there, babe.

918
01:01:36,778 --> 01:01:38,006
Hold it.

919
01:01:38,881 --> 01:01:40,143
Come on.

920
01:01:40,949 --> 01:01:41,938
God.

921
01:01:43,485 --> 01:01:44,474
Baby.

922
01:01:45,554 --> 01:01:46,919
Don't let me go.

923
01:02:09,778 --> 01:02:11,143
Turn right.

924
01:02:14,716 --> 01:02:16,115
Go.

925
01:02:22,791 --> 01:02:24,486
Okay, not so fast.

926
01:02:25,894 --> 01:02:28,192
Okay. Easy.

927
01:03:05,167 --> 01:03:06,998
Wrong way. Over here.

928
01:03:07,369 --> 01:03:09,769
Wrong way. Get away.

929
01:03:10,072 --> 01:03:11,903
That's cold. Get away.

930
01:03:11,974 --> 01:03:13,908
Get away from there. Help.

931
01:03:13,976 --> 01:03:15,034
Don't do it.

932
01:03:15,110 --> 01:03:16,975
Take a drink, and that's it.

933
01:03:29,524 --> 01:03:31,048
Can you swim?

934
01:03:43,505 --> 01:03:45,302
Hey, no kicking.

935
01:04:09,564 --> 01:04:10,895
You bully!

936
01:04:17,806 --> 01:04:20,741
You're gonna leave a ring around this lake.

937
01:04:27,749 --> 01:04:30,149
You know, if you just stay there,
we'll be fine.

938
01:04:30,218 --> 01:04:32,379
Okay, I'll tell you when to move.

939
01:04:34,056 --> 01:04:37,150
Never mind. No. That's okay. Go on ahead.

940
01:04:37,392 --> 01:04:39,656
It's not you, it's your truck.

941
01:04:39,728 --> 01:04:41,059
Thank you.

942
01:04:41,163 --> 01:04:42,630
That's what happens. You know?

943
01:04:42,697 --> 01:04:44,722
Sometimes you're hot, sometimes you're not.

944
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:47,564
I don't know if you ever heard that one,
but it's a truism.

945
01:04:49,905 --> 01:04:51,133
This could be.

946
01:04:51,506 --> 01:04:53,940
This could be. Yeah, you're the man.

947
01:04:54,009 --> 01:04:56,671
Come on, big man,
let me hear you downshift.

948
01:04:56,745 --> 01:05:00,044
Yes, hit those brakes. Come on. Yes, sir.

949
01:05:01,249 --> 01:05:03,376
Stay there. Don't come out.

950
01:05:03,452 --> 01:05:05,317
You the man.

951
01:05:05,620 --> 01:05:09,021
You the good Samaritan. Yes, sir.

952
01:05:09,091 --> 01:05:12,959
Hey, goin' all the way to Los Angeles,
how about that?

953
01:05:13,028 --> 01:05:15,360
- Santa Monica.
- Santa Monica.

954
01:05:15,430 --> 01:05:16,988
Outstanding.

955
01:05:17,132 --> 01:05:18,497
Man.

956
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,730
No, what've you done? No.

957
01:05:21,837 --> 01:05:24,863
My gosh, who taught you how to hitchhike?

958
01:05:25,340 --> 01:05:27,900
There's two types of animals in this world...

959
01:05:27,976 --> 01:05:30,945
...ones you can hitch with
and ones you can't hitch with.

960
01:05:33,248 --> 01:05:35,182
God, get back there.

961
01:05:35,250 --> 01:05:37,309
Get back. Back. Come on.

962
01:05:38,887 --> 01:05:40,081
Freeze.

963
01:05:40,522 --> 01:05:41,853
We need aerial surveillance.

964
01:05:41,923 --> 01:05:44,824
We got to have road blocks,
east and west and north and south.

965
01:05:44,893 --> 01:05:46,656
We need bloodhounds sniffing 'em down...

966
01:05:46,728 --> 01:05:48,355
...and we need this shotgun loaded.

967
01:05:48,430 --> 01:05:50,955
You know what I'm saying?
This ain't no picnic walk.

968
01:05:51,032 --> 01:05:55,264
I'm tellin' ya, you turn your back on the
skillet, the grease is gonna burn your butt.

969
01:05:58,306 --> 01:06:00,866
The dumb are lucky, aren't they?

970
01:06:07,883 --> 01:06:10,249
Should know better
than rely on the authorities.

971
01:06:10,318 --> 01:06:12,047
Get off of my truck!

972
01:06:13,355 --> 01:06:16,483
Tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna go form my own dragnet.

973
01:06:17,159 --> 01:06:19,684
Or better yet, I might just go it alone.
That's right.

974
01:06:19,761 --> 01:06:20,750
Man.

975
01:06:40,749 --> 01:06:42,216
To repeat...

976
01:06:42,284 --> 01:06:44,479
...brown eyes, gray complexion, weight...

977
01:06:44,553 --> 01:06:47,545
...approximately 8,000 pounds.

978
01:06:51,726 --> 01:06:54,217
I have no idea where we are.

979
01:06:55,430 --> 01:06:58,866
I wonder what Kirby means by
"Badlands of New Mexico."

980
01:07:01,570 --> 01:07:05,267
You know, I was just thinking about
all those poor people on the Interstate.

981
01:07:07,008 --> 01:07:08,635
They're missin' all of this.

982
01:07:24,893 --> 01:07:26,360
Good morning.

983
01:07:28,396 --> 01:07:30,261
Sorry, good afternoon.

984
01:07:34,269 --> 01:07:37,033
Why in the hell aren't you a camel?

985
01:07:37,239 --> 01:07:39,673
I don't want an elephant. I want a camel.

986
01:07:59,661 --> 01:08:00,650
Thanks, Vera.

987
01:08:01,730 --> 01:08:05,222
I'm sorry about what I said,
about not wanting an elephant.

988
01:08:20,248 --> 01:08:21,408
It's rain!

989
01:08:21,716 --> 01:08:23,445
Vera, it's rain!

990
01:08:23,785 --> 01:08:24,911
It's rain!

991
01:08:25,654 --> 01:08:27,178
It's raining!

992
01:08:38,099 --> 01:08:40,124
My whining days are over!

993
01:08:44,706 --> 01:08:46,731
No, it's not enough...

994
01:08:47,409 --> 01:08:49,309
...that we gotta be completely lost...

995
01:08:49,377 --> 01:08:51,777
...but we gotta be completely drenched, too!

996
01:08:51,980 --> 01:08:55,780
And I'm wearing a wool coat
that makes me smell like a dog inside a car.

997
01:08:55,850 --> 01:08:56,942
Alto!

998
01:08:59,254 --> 01:09:00,812
New Mexico State Police.

999
01:09:01,022 --> 01:09:02,353
How'd you find us?

1000
01:09:03,692 --> 01:09:04,886
Through prayer.

1001
01:09:08,096 --> 01:09:09,859
Please, we must move faster!

1002
01:09:09,931 --> 01:09:11,262
Over here!

1003
01:09:19,474 --> 01:09:21,442
The church! Get over to the church!

1004
01:09:27,048 --> 01:09:28,743
Is help on the way?

1005
01:09:29,250 --> 01:09:31,218
The phone lines are down.

1006
01:09:31,619 --> 01:09:33,587
There is no village without the church!

1007
01:09:55,543 --> 01:09:57,943
Come on, I can't do it alone. Let's go.

1008
01:10:08,823 --> 01:10:09,881
No!

1009
01:10:16,398 --> 01:10:18,628
Isn't there anything you can do?

1010
01:10:19,701 --> 01:10:21,032
Up here, push up here.

1011
01:10:21,102 --> 01:10:23,332
Come on, honey. Push up here.

1012
01:10:32,781 --> 01:10:34,305
Vera!

1013
01:11:29,838 --> 01:11:31,271
Señor Corcoran.

1014
01:11:31,873 --> 01:11:33,101
Gracias.

1015
01:11:33,908 --> 01:11:37,867
This is the plan for the shrine for Vera.

1016
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:43,583
I prefer Vera to pose for me
for two hours every morning.

1017
01:11:43,818 --> 01:11:46,286
You know,
I have to be taking Vera somewhere else.

1018
01:11:46,354 --> 01:11:47,981
Señor Corcoran...

1019
01:11:48,256 --> 01:11:50,417
...Vera is the savior of our village.

1020
01:11:50,558 --> 01:11:52,048
We want her to stay.

1021
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:53,693
Her and you, of course.

1022
01:11:53,761 --> 01:11:56,286
I don't know where I belong anymore.

1023
01:11:58,967 --> 01:12:00,457
Vera has a calling.

1024
01:12:01,102 --> 01:12:02,933
She's the elephant of my father.

1025
01:12:03,771 --> 01:12:07,002
I think that he would want me to see
that she gets into the movies.

1026
01:12:07,075 --> 01:12:09,236
And you will be in the movies with her?

1027
01:12:09,310 --> 01:12:10,800
With her? Me?

1028
01:12:11,212 --> 01:12:14,545
Of course. I mean, you are a performer, no?

1029
01:12:15,216 --> 01:12:16,205
Well...

1030
01:12:19,454 --> 01:12:20,443
Do you...

1031
01:12:20,622 --> 01:12:22,817
...have a phone that I might use someplace?

1032
01:12:40,708 --> 01:12:41,902
"Terry Bonura.

1033
01:12:41,976 --> 01:12:43,568
"Hollywood, California."

1034
01:12:47,582 --> 01:12:52,178
Jack, I waited and waited.
I thought you fell off the face of the earth.

1035
01:12:52,620 --> 01:12:55,111
Well, Vera and I were perfecting
one of our tricks.

1036
01:12:56,190 --> 01:12:57,623
God, I can't wait.

1037
01:12:57,892 --> 01:13:02,454
Listen, we're doing commercials all week
down at the LA Sports Arena.

1038
01:13:02,530 --> 01:13:03,895
Why don't you come down?

1039
01:13:03,965 --> 01:13:06,695
- I'm the one with all the wild animals.
- Sure.

1040
01:13:06,768 --> 01:13:09,635
Would you call Mo and tell her
we're doing something together?

1041
01:13:09,704 --> 01:13:13,333
I mean, she called me twice, and
I don't know how well you know Mo, but...

1042
01:13:13,408 --> 01:13:14,932
Consider it done.

1043
01:13:15,810 --> 01:13:18,005
- Hello.
- Mo. Jack Corcoran.

1044
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:19,740
I tried to let you down easy...

1045
01:13:19,814 --> 01:13:22,282
...but I understand
you've been harassing Terry.

1046
01:13:22,350 --> 01:13:24,978
Yeah? You tell Terry to come
clean out my cages.

1047
01:13:25,119 --> 01:13:26,950
Just because she has a bigger budget?

1048
01:13:27,021 --> 01:13:28,545
So that's what it's all about, huh?

1049
01:13:28,623 --> 01:13:32,957
You know, Vera deserves more than
three shows a day, seven days a week.

1050
01:13:36,064 --> 01:13:38,430
- Buenos días, Señor Jack.
- Buenos días, Padre.

1051
01:13:38,499 --> 01:13:41,229
The movies will be Vera's shrine.

1052
01:13:41,569 --> 01:13:42,831
How may we help?

1053
01:13:43,037 --> 01:13:44,026
Well...

1054
01:13:44,205 --> 01:13:45,399
...the movies...

1055
01:13:45,740 --> 01:13:49,733
...are in downtown LA,
which is two state lines away from here.

1056
01:13:49,877 --> 01:13:51,208
And I'm kind of...

1057
01:13:51,746 --> 01:13:53,509
- Wanted?
- Yes.

1058
01:13:53,581 --> 01:13:57,039
- Are you on America's Most Wanted?
- Not yet.

1059
01:13:57,385 --> 01:13:58,374
Some day.

1060
01:13:59,587 --> 01:14:02,954
I've been looking at these maps
of my father's and...

1061
01:14:03,791 --> 01:14:05,281
...I got the feeling...

1062
01:14:05,426 --> 01:14:08,156
...that state lines might get kind of fuzzy...

1063
01:14:08,463 --> 01:14:09,930
...around here.

1064
01:14:10,264 --> 01:14:12,698
We have many friends there.

1065
01:14:12,967 --> 01:14:14,400
How else may we help?

1066
01:14:14,902 --> 01:14:17,928
Well, I've noticed that people
have been staring at me.

1067
01:14:18,006 --> 01:14:20,600
They're saying,
"He wears the same clothes every day.

1068
01:14:20,675 --> 01:14:22,768
- "Doesn't he have anything else?"
- Javier!

1069
01:15:32,647 --> 01:15:34,171
That's a beautiful animal.

1070
01:15:34,248 --> 01:15:35,545
Thank you.

1071
01:15:36,017 --> 01:15:37,006
Same to you.

1072
01:16:52,193 --> 01:16:55,185
Yeah, I think you're right.
I smell peanuts, too.

1073
01:17:24,425 --> 01:17:25,551
Hey.

1074
01:17:26,260 --> 01:17:28,091
I guess I know who you two are.

1075
01:17:28,496 --> 01:17:31,021
Big one must be Vera,
and you must be Jack, right?

1076
01:17:31,098 --> 01:17:32,531
Terry.

1077
01:17:33,501 --> 01:17:35,731
You're as pretty as you sound.

1078
01:17:36,204 --> 01:17:39,401
This is Rosie. This is Vera and Jack.

1079
01:17:39,574 --> 01:17:41,633
Where are your manners? Say hello.

1080
01:17:44,579 --> 01:17:46,706
Hey, you've quite a way with her.

1081
01:17:46,781 --> 01:17:48,806
Ever think about doing an act yourself?

1082
01:17:49,016 --> 01:17:50,711
It's funny you should say that.

1083
01:17:50,785 --> 01:17:54,152
First we'll do Vera's deal,
and then we'll talk about your future.

1084
01:17:55,356 --> 01:17:57,483
This is Chris. He'll take care of Vera.

1085
01:17:57,558 --> 01:18:00,789
- You come with me to the office.
- Okay, I'll be right back.

1086
01:18:00,895 --> 01:18:03,056
You know, Jack, I am your only buyer now.

1087
01:18:03,130 --> 01:18:05,189
Word is,
Mo's already spent her whole budget.

1088
01:18:05,266 --> 01:18:07,632
It's gonna take $50,000 for me to break even.

1089
01:18:08,069 --> 01:18:10,663
That's the truck Vera and I should've had.

1090
01:18:13,808 --> 01:18:16,038
$50,000? It's peanuts
to somebody like yourself.

1091
01:18:16,444 --> 01:18:17,741
Dig deep.

1092
01:18:18,312 --> 01:18:19,973
$50,000 it is.

1093
01:18:21,048 --> 01:18:24,711
Let's see, here's the contract.
Where's that damn pen?

1094
01:18:24,785 --> 01:18:26,946
What's this? An electric back-scratcher?

1095
01:18:28,789 --> 01:18:32,054
Back-scratcher?
No, honey, that's an electric goad.

1096
01:18:34,262 --> 01:18:37,663
Don't tell me you got her here from Maryland
without a zing or two.

1097
01:18:37,732 --> 01:18:40,360
Natural Talent, Terry Bonura speaking.

1098
01:18:41,602 --> 01:18:42,591
Hi.

1099
01:18:44,538 --> 01:18:47,473
No, you're supposed to
bring them down to the ranch.

1100
01:18:48,042 --> 01:18:49,339
Get over!

1101
01:18:49,977 --> 01:18:52,969
You can have your wife insured
for $1,000,000, but...

1102
01:18:53,047 --> 01:18:55,914
...that doesn't mean
you can sell her for that much.

1103
01:18:58,719 --> 01:19:02,018
The deal was three shows a day,
seven days a week, right?

1104
01:19:05,159 --> 01:19:06,990
No, they're coming to us, remember?

1105
01:19:07,061 --> 01:19:09,427
I thought we were gonna be partners.

1106
01:19:09,664 --> 01:19:10,995
All right.

1107
01:19:11,165 --> 01:19:14,498
Jack? Vera's okay.
Why don't you sign the papers?

1108
01:19:15,937 --> 01:19:18,167
Look, Cookie, I'm trying to make this work.

1109
01:19:41,729 --> 01:19:44,562
7:48 San Diego time with Bob Mankiewicz.

1110
01:19:50,371 --> 01:19:53,670
I've got an elephant here for Sri Lanka.
The gene-pool project.

1111
01:19:55,409 --> 01:19:57,468
Nothing on the sheet about another elephant.

1112
01:19:57,545 --> 01:20:00,673
- You didn't get the word. It's okay.
- The sheet is the word.

1113
01:20:01,048 --> 01:20:04,040
We didn't come this far
to get stopped by you.

1114
01:20:04,652 --> 01:20:07,120
Turn the vehicle around, sir, now.

1115
01:20:08,389 --> 01:20:09,913
I don't see why not.

1116
01:20:23,437 --> 01:20:28,272
The white zone is for immediate loading
and unloading of passengers only.

1117
01:20:32,113 --> 01:20:37,016
All right, that was a little bumpy.
Sorry. Come out. Let's go.

1118
01:20:37,118 --> 01:20:38,642
Come on, move.

1119
01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:42,485
Hey, y'all!
San Diego country time comin' on 7:57.

1120
01:20:56,337 --> 01:20:58,862
Would everybody in the building
excuse us, please?

1121
01:20:58,939 --> 01:21:01,169
We're trying to make a plane.

1122
01:21:07,548 --> 01:21:10,881
Could you just get up against the wall?
Thank you.

1123
01:21:11,185 --> 01:21:12,174
Come on, honey.

1124
01:21:19,660 --> 01:21:21,753
One more for Sri Lanka, please.

1125
01:21:22,296 --> 01:21:26,665
Sir, you have introduced a dangerous animal
into a situation where people can get hurt.

1126
01:21:26,734 --> 01:21:29,601
She is not dangerous.
She's very large, but she's jolly.

1127
01:21:29,670 --> 01:21:33,606
- You must get her out of here.
- She's not just an elephant, but a role model.

1128
01:21:33,674 --> 01:21:34,902
She saved my life.

1129
01:21:35,142 --> 01:21:38,009
She's trying to make a plane
that leaves in three minutes.

1130
01:21:38,079 --> 01:21:41,606
If she could get on the plane,
she could carve out a new life for herself.

1131
01:21:41,682 --> 01:21:43,707
Excuse me!

1132
01:21:45,219 --> 01:21:46,208
All right.

1133
01:21:46,287 --> 01:21:48,016
How do we know you have a connection?

1134
01:21:48,089 --> 01:21:51,786
- How do we know you're not a...
- A guy walking around with an elephant?

1135
01:21:51,859 --> 01:21:52,951
Fair question.

1136
01:21:53,027 --> 01:21:55,018
Come on, work with me, will you?

1137
01:21:55,096 --> 01:21:57,064
Give us an escort out to the gate.

1138
01:21:57,131 --> 01:21:59,190
Then if I'm lying, you can shoot me.

1139
01:21:59,366 --> 01:22:01,493
You may both shoot me.

1140
01:22:01,902 --> 01:22:04,370
That's a good deal.
That sounds good, doesn't it?

1141
01:22:04,438 --> 01:22:07,339
- Jim? It is Jim, isn't it?
- Yeah, it is.

1142
01:22:07,408 --> 01:22:08,898
Thank you. Good people.

1143
01:22:08,976 --> 01:22:11,206
Jack Corcoran. Appreciate it. Thank you.

1144
01:22:11,278 --> 01:22:14,076
Come back here!
Don't listen to that man right there.

1145
01:22:14,148 --> 01:22:16,480
Him and his fuzzy friend
are homicidal maniacs.

1146
01:22:16,550 --> 01:22:20,646
Mamas, grab your babies!
Pick 'em up slow, and move back.

1147
01:22:22,022 --> 01:22:25,116
You got a nut on your hands here.
Good luck. I'll see ya.

1148
01:22:25,192 --> 01:22:26,989
- Wait a minute.
- I don't have a minute.

1149
01:22:27,061 --> 01:22:29,256
- They tried to hurt you, sir?
- Yeah.

1150
01:22:29,730 --> 01:22:31,425
Tried to hurt me, all right.

1151
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:36,164
Played my trucking buddy a while,
and then tried to kill me.

1152
01:22:36,237 --> 01:22:38,296
- Hijacked my rig!
- Hijacked?

1153
01:22:38,372 --> 01:22:40,966
Yeah. He's gonna try
and do the same thing to your 747.

1154
01:22:41,041 --> 01:22:43,407
Watch him, he's a hustler! He's streetsmart.

1155
01:22:45,312 --> 01:22:47,337
Yeah, proceed with caution.

1156
01:22:53,687 --> 01:22:54,881
What was that?

1157
01:22:57,925 --> 01:22:59,756
- What's that?
- What was what?

1158
01:23:02,763 --> 01:23:05,561
There's something in that bag.
Be careful. Somebody...

1159
01:23:10,104 --> 01:23:11,230
I saw that!

1160
01:23:11,305 --> 01:23:13,330
Back-up. Bring in back-up, I think.

1161
01:23:13,407 --> 01:23:17,104
Don't do it alone. Bring in some back-up.
He's got something in that bag.

1162
01:23:25,119 --> 01:23:27,679
We got a possible case 212. Case 212.

1163
01:23:27,755 --> 01:23:29,586
Concourse D. We need back-up right away.

1164
01:23:29,657 --> 01:23:32,854
We're gonna need a couple pounds
of bacon and some Polish sausage.

1165
01:23:34,628 --> 01:23:36,220
This whole thing is a sting.

1166
01:23:38,899 --> 01:23:42,460
So, what if the thing's
a federal sting operation to get to me?

1167
01:23:42,570 --> 01:23:44,504
Focus.

1168
01:24:02,890 --> 01:24:05,188
I got this from your oily girlfriend.

1169
01:24:10,898 --> 01:24:12,365
Are you gonna help or not?

1170
01:24:13,300 --> 01:24:14,597
Get him, Frank!

1171
01:24:15,302 --> 01:24:17,770
Please, for the love of God, help.

1172
01:24:18,872 --> 01:24:22,308
If an agent goes down,
you're gonna have blood on your hands.

1173
01:24:27,314 --> 01:24:29,179
Come on, this isn't funny now.

1174
01:24:31,485 --> 01:24:32,713
Go!

1175
01:24:40,427 --> 01:24:41,689
Come on.

1176
01:24:42,396 --> 01:24:44,057
Step aside, ladies!

1177
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:48,163
We made it.

1178
01:24:48,702 --> 01:24:50,693
One more for first class!

1179
01:25:01,882 --> 01:25:03,850
- Are you Mo?
- Is this Vera?

1180
01:25:04,285 --> 01:25:05,877
She's beautiful.

1181
01:25:06,053 --> 01:25:07,953
You know, Jack, I spent my whole budget.

1182
01:25:08,022 --> 01:25:09,683
Yeah, Terry told me.

1183
01:25:09,757 --> 01:25:13,090
I'm curious. With all the decent
animal trainers in this world...

1184
01:25:13,160 --> 01:25:15,060
...how could you hook up with Terry?

1185
01:25:15,329 --> 01:25:17,422
Terry had a nice telephone manner.

1186
01:25:18,932 --> 01:25:22,834
- She gonna be all right on that thing?
- Relax, animal lover, she'll be fine.

1187
01:25:23,570 --> 01:25:27,131
They're very good company for one another,
and they're infinitely patient.

1188
01:25:27,574 --> 01:25:29,838
Mo, can I take this one?

1189
01:25:35,749 --> 01:25:36,977
Come on, girl.

1190
01:25:37,284 --> 01:25:38,512
Come on.

1191
01:25:47,695 --> 01:25:50,562
Well, you go on ahead
and have a lot of little elephants.

1192
01:25:50,631 --> 01:25:54,624
You got me to a better place,
and I'm gonna do the same for you.

1193
01:25:55,936 --> 01:25:59,895
I'll even pretend that it doesn't hurt
to watch you get on the plane.

1194
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:16,477
Right now I'm supposed to be giving
the biggest speech of my life.

1195
01:27:17,518 --> 01:27:19,247
I'm $50,000 in the hole...

1196
01:27:20,487 --> 01:27:22,079
...l've stolen a truck...

1197
01:27:23,924 --> 01:27:26,893
...and all I can think about is
how much I'm gonna miss her.

1198
01:27:29,596 --> 01:27:31,962
You know,
they say an elephant never forgets.

1199
01:27:34,234 --> 01:27:36,429
But what they don't tell you is that...

1200
01:27:37,538 --> 01:27:39,369
...you never forget an elephant.

1201
01:28:06,533 --> 01:28:09,627
You wanna go to Salads and Such?
I'm vegetarian.

1202
01:28:10,137 --> 01:28:11,229
So was Vera.
