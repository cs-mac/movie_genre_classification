<i>Once, man and those in the water</i>
<i>were linked.</i>

3
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,955
<i>They inspired us.</i>

4
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,270
<i>They spoke of the future.</i>

5
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,991
<i>Man listened and it became real.</i>

6
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,314
<i>But man does not listen very well.</i>

7
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:50,077
<i>Man 's need to own everything</i>
<i>led him deeper into land.</i>

8
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,550
<i>The magic world of the ones</i>
<i>that live in the ocean...</i>

9
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,995
<i>...and the world of men...</i>

10
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,310
<i>...separated.</i>

11
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,598
<i>Through the centuries, their world,</i>
<i>and all the inhabitants of it...</i>

12
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,637
<i>...stopped trying.</i>

13
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,752
<i>The world of man became more violent.</i>

14
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,552
<i>War upon war played out,</i>
<i>as there were no guides to listen to.</i>

15
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,679
<i>Now those in the water</i>
<i>are trying again...</i>

16
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,354
<i>... trying to reach us.</i>

17
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:27,275
<i>A handful of their precious young ones</i>
<i>have been sent into the world of man.</i>

18
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,034
<i>They are brought in the dead of night...</i>

19
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,397
<i>... to where man lives.</i>

20
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,313
<i>They need only be glimpsed...</i>

21
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,109
<i>...and the awakening of man</i>
<i>will happen.</i>

22
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,511
<i>But their enemies roam the land.</i>

23
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,036
<i>There are laws that are meant</i>
<i>to keep the young ones safe...</i>

24
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,954
<i>...but they are sent</i>
<i>at great risk to their lives.</i>

25
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,838
<i>Many...</i>

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,956
<i>...do not return.</i>

27
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,434
<i>Yet still they try...</i>

28
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,512
<i>... try to help man.</i>

29
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:10,151
<i>But man may have</i>
<i>forgotten how to listen.</i>

Lady in the Water (2006)

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,117
My daughter says to be careful,
Mr. Heep.

32
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,592
Well, it's some kind
of a b-- B-- B-- Bug.

33
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,671
It's very big.

34
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,317
It's very hairy.

35
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:51,030
My other daughter says it's
some kind of creature the devil made.

36
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,474
Tell her it's not a creature.

37
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,712
There's no such thing as creatures,
all right?

38
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,428
You. . . .

39
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,034
You might wanna turn away.

40
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,678
Sorry this is taking so long.

41
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,869
It's over. It's over.

42
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,754
It's-- It's safe.

43
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:44,435
My daughter says
thank you for protecting them.

44
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,959
Mr. Farber?

45
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,918
I'm Cleveland Heep.
Welcome to the Cove.

46
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,231
Mr. Heep!

47
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,234
You are new tenant?

48
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,790
Yeah, this is Mr. Farber. He's in 13B.

49
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,270
Now, Mr. Farber, this is Young-Soon
Choi. She lives with her mother in 8A.

50
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,671
She's a student at the university.

51
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,435
Young-Soon, you don't know. . .

52
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,195
. . .who's been swimming in the pool
the last few nights, do you?

53
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,555
No, Mr. Heep.

54
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,794
By the way, here. Thanks. I liked it.

55
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,518
You're welcome.

56
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,753
Mr. Heep loves learning.
He doesn't want people to know.

57
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,791
Mr. Heep, pool man looking for you.
I tell him you come soon.

58
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,149
Could you wait here just a moment,
please?

59
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,632
Gonna ask something. Answer straight.
You guys having parties in here?

60
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,075
Bubble parties, bubble bath,
everyone skinny-dipping?

61
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,434
No.

62
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,672
-Those bubbles make the water very slick.
-No.

63
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,078
I'll trust you on that. But something
is making this water like this.

64
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,789
There has been someone
swimming at nighttime.

65
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,590
I hear sp-- Sp-- Sp--
Splashing some nights.

66
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,597
I left here yesterday afternoon,
this filter was empty.

67
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,675
You kind of look like maybe
you could work out a little bit, right?

68
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,312
I could give you a vein like that.

69
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,995
I could make it look just like this. Right?

70
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,870
Most people say,
"What's wrong with you, Reggie?

71
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,759
Why you only working out
on one side of your body?"

72
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:38,391
I tell them it's like an experiment.
I'm like a scientist.

73
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,429
This morning I measured my bicep.

74
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,672
Four-and-a-half-inch difference
from one side to the other.

75
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,353
Look at that.

76
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,715
Take a guess at the difference
between my thighs.

77
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,519
-Hello, Reggie.
-Hey.

78
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,035
-Hey. Sorry.
-Hey.

79
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,880
Me and the new guy,
we're talking science.

80
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,554
Okay, that's great. Here we go, Mr. F--

81
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,950
Here we go. Come on.

82
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:12,309
Don't hang out in the stairwell,
Reggie, please.

83
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,675
-Okay.
-All right.

84
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:19,038
Just-- People might trip.

85
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,189
All right.

86
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,193
Reggie's harmless.
He just wants to be special.

87
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,510
He's working out
only one side of his body.

88
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,319
Did he--? Did he tell you that?

89
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,277
<i>--be inside within minutes.</i>

90
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,634
Hello, Mr. Leeds.

91
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,349
<i>Those soldiers are only now beginning to</i>
<i>wonder how long they'll end up staying.</i>

92
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,308
<i>If this does come to combat, we will not</i>
<i>be in the battle for the sake of the battle.</i>

93
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,993
He's been here f-- F-- Forever.

94
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,469
<i>--will not be reached any other way.</i>

95
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,351
Mrs. Bell, she takes in animals.
Smart lady. You'd like her.

96
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,312
-He-- Not just because he died.
-There's a bunch of people better.

97
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,869
-Name four people better.
-Name one better than Fred.

98
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:02,272
Axl Rose. Sebastian Bach.
Bret Michaels is better than he is.

99
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,273
Bret Michaels.
I'd rather listen to Bon-- Jon Bon Jovi.

100
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,555
What? Are you. . .?

101
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,312
This is you.

102
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,792
There's no smoking inside.

103
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,394
And there's no swimming after 7.

104
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:29,030
I hope it's okay to ask: What brings you
here from the West Coast, Mr. Farber?

105
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,237
I've been hired to be the local film
and book critic for the paper.

106
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,311
They flew you all the way
out here for that?

107
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:38,632
-They did.
-Well, you must be very good.

108
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,511
<i>Mr. Heep, Betty Pen again.</i>

109
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,514
<i>I smell something awful</i>
<i>coming from the upstairs apartment.</i>

110
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:07,708
<i>I think someone may have died</i>
<i>and the body is decomposing.</i>

111
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,111
<i>I know I said this last week, but--</i>

112
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,790
<i>Not everyone here</i>
<i>spent Sunday practicing for war.</i>

113
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,839
<i>At Sunday church services,</i>
<i>chaplains rallied the troops.</i>

114
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,434
<i>For these Marines,</i>
<i>a moment for prayer...</i>

115
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:36,958
<i>...at a service that many here believe</i>
<i>will be their last before going to war.</i>

116
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:42,075
<i>U.S. forces predicted today the enemy,</i>
<i>estimated at 3 to 4000...</i>

117
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,832
<i>...may be willing....</i>

118
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,550
<i>--a major-- A major confrontation.</i>

119
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,271
<i>At the same time, the U.S. military</i>
<i>will be fighting a propaganda war.</i>

120
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,115
<i>If there were a silver bullet,</i>
<i>we would've shot that a long time ago.</i>

121
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,914
Hey! I saw you!

122
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,116
I saw you!

123
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,160
Come out of that pool right now!

124
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,759
Hey!

125
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,718
I'm gonna wait.

126
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,879
Hey.

127
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,719
Hey.

128
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,197
Come on out, now. It's--

129
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,755
It's-- It's not safe.

130
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,834
Come on out. This is not f--

131
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,551
This is not funny.

132
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,431
Please sto--

133
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,318
God.

134
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,675
Did you pull me out?

135
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,558
Where are you from?

136
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,910
The Blue World.

137
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,310
Is that an apartment?

138
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,034
Do you feel an awakening?

139
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,552
I'm sorry?

140
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,030
It will feel like pins and needles. . .

141
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,511
. . .inside.

142
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,396
It is not you.

143
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,318
It's late.

144
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,752
You really. . . .

145
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,436
You shouldn't be here.

146
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,112
I'm kind of old-fashioned that way.
I don't even know your name.

147
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,918
My name is Story.

148
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,150
I didn't mean for you to tell--

149
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,631
Why am I not stuttering?

150
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,199
What?

151
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,073
Hello, Story, my name is Cleveland.

152
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,117
"From the cliffs. "

153
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,120
That is what your name means.

154
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,032
Where did you learn that?

155
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,031
From my studies.

156
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:00,034
I promise that I will not
get you into trouble. You can go.

157
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,830
I am scared.

158
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,192
I will wait here with you, Cleveland.

159
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,111
Why are you scared?

160
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,597
You can wait here for a little bit. . .

161
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,274
. . .until you feel not so scared.

162
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,032
Are you okay?

163
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,592
Oh, my God. You're just a kid.

164
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,319
Hello.

165
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,028
Okay. It's time to go. Story, come on.

166
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,313
Okay.

167
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,914
I think you need some fresh air.

168
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,159
I'm just gonna take you outside.

169
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,515
I'm gonna put you
on one of the pool chairs.

170
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,955
I'm gonna get you some coffee. . .

171
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,270
. . .and then you can wake up.

172
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,710
Then I'll walk you home.

173
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,837
Tell me, who in the world
are you, anyway?

174
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,231
-Narf.
-What?

175
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,716
Okay. Come on.

176
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,673
Here we go.

177
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,079
Okay.

178
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,632
It was sort of h-- H-- Hairy, but--
But matted, like clumps. You know?

179
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,394
And it was kind of g-- Green.

180
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,437
-You say green?
-Yeah.

181
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,956
I thought so. Matted is-- Is not right.

182
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:55,240
It was f-- F-- Flat, and--
And thicker than hair.

183
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,519
Like this. Like this.
Flat and this kind of a color.

184
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:05,754
-And-- Is this not helping you at all?
-Forget about its hair for a second.

185
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,595
It's obviously some dumb animal
who muddied himself. About how tall?

186
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,228
-What, was it a Great Dane?
-No, no, no. No, sir.

187
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,234
I mean, are there any w-- W--
Wolves in this area? Hyenas?

188
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,790
Jack, this is Philadelphia.
Where do you think you're living?

189
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,437
Sorry. Something keeps
setting off the sprinklers.

190
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,672
I'll look around the forest and check
behind the dumpsters and stuff.

191
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,990
An animal that size,
the one you're describing. . .

192
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,878
. . .doesn't walk around and not be seen.

193
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,679
There's nowhere for
a dumb big animal to hide.

194
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,749
Cleveland.

195
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,398
Hey.

196
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,832
Got a lot of homework, huh?

197
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,389
University gives many pages of reading.

198
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,279
What they think, I have no social life?

199
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,151
I got more books for you.

200
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,108
Could you look up
the word "narf" for me?

201
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,755
It's an Eastern bedtime story, Mr. Heep.

202
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,069
I do not remember it.

203
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,073
My great-grandmother
used to tell it when she was alive.

204
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,674
A b-- B-- B--

205
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,870
Bedtime story?

206
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,871
What's the story?

207
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,950
I do not remember.

208
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,991
How about your mother?

209
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,873
Hello, Mrs. Choi. Hello.

210
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,150
She wants to know
who told you this word.

211
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,711
Oh, j-- Just a friend. I don't--
I don't-- I don't know her very well.

212
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,994
She said that her grandmother. . .

213
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:03,030
. . .used to tell this story like a prayer.
Like it was true.

214
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:09,558
She said that she knew someone
who knew someone who saw one.

215
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,438
Saw one what?

216
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:19,472
A narf, the bedtime story says,
is a sea nymph.

217
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:26,275
Is-- What--
What happens in the story, please?

218
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,836
No. Mrs.--

219
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,193
In the bedtime story. . .

220
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:50,554
. . .she must be seen
by the one human chosen for her.

221
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,351
This person is called the vessel.

222
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:04,389
Seeing the narf will awaken something
in the chosen one.

223
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:07,358
If she's successful in this. . .

224
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:14,313
. . .she will return with the Great Eatlon,
a giant eagle. . .

225
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,789
. . .and become free.

226
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,270
She won't tell me more.

227
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:24,194
She said, why can't I be like
my older sister. She married a dentist.

228
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,678
Story?

229
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,352
Story?

230
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,832
Cleveland.

231
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,396
Story, could you
put something back on, please?

232
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:12,153
Are you here to meet someone,
see someone in this building?

233
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,231
Is somebody supposed to see you?

234
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,789
Is--?

235
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,989
I--

236
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,997
It is a writer.

237
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,196
Do you know his name?

238
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,355
Do you know what he looks like?

239
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,588
Do you know if it's a--?
A woman or a man?

240
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,879
Is there something
that you wanna tell me?

241
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:16,511
Is this person
writing something important?

242
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,957
When do you have to leave?

243
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,874
I can leave tonight if I meet this person.

244
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,235
I'm gonna help you get home.

245
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,555
Thank you, Cleveland.

246
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,232
I have to go.

247
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,948
Hello. I-- I--

248
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,516
I wanted to ask you
something about your work.

249
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,956
Your c-- C-- Critic work.

250
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,749
How's it-- How's-- How's--
How's it going?

251
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:02,630
I'm seeing a romance film tonight.
Not my cup of tea.

252
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,234
So you-- You--
You haven't written anything yet?

253
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,152
Haven't written anything
for some time.

254
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,108
You were right about that one tenant.

255
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,316
I spoke with Mrs. Bell.

256
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,075
We got along.
She's very good with animals.

257
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,111
You know she wrote a book?

258
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:24,069
Mr. Heep,
I will be taking the cat in directly.

259
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,192
Don't worry, Mrs. Bell.

260
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,038
Lookie here.

261
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,315
My, there's a lot of butterflies
around this building.

262
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:41,756
Strange behavior for them.
They're not usually so trusting.

263
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,956
I understand that you're a writer,
Mrs. Bell.

264
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,633
Now, where'd you hear such things?

265
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:56,111
Maybe I read your book.

266
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,909
That'd be quite a trick.
It's been out of print for 20 years.

267
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,390
Twenty years?
So you haven't written anything recently?

268
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,950
Mr. Farber has been speaking
out of turn.

269
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,151
Look at this cereal character's picture,
Dad.

270
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,393
Looks like Aunt Sylvia when she found out
everybody hated her fruit-bowl painting.

271
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:21,998
I need a nine-letter word
for "in human form. "

272
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,950
You'll figure it out, Dad.

273
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,873
I. . . .

274
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,398
You know, the color on this box
look just like the colors of your car, Dad.

275
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,994
Maybe we should take your car
and go visit Aunt Sylvia.

276
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,752
Incarnate.

277
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:42,432
Well, you're very good
with those word puzzles, Mr. Dury.

278
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,990
He's a grand-master level.
I'm gonna be just like him.

279
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,152
-So you like words a lot, huh?
-I adore them.

280
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,437
Are you-- Are you writing anything,
Mr. Dury?

281
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,033
A book, maybe?

282
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,349
No, I--

283
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:00,150
I'm afraid my skills are limited
to crossword puzzles.

284
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,830
That's some serious reekage, man.

285
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,468
You don't even speak English anymore.

286
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,110
What, reekage? Damn straight
it's English. The state of reek.

287
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,430
There's no "reekage," man.

288
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:17,833
Some toker just like us made it up
somewhere, and here you are speaking it.

289
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:22,073
Let's make up a witty phrase.
It'll become famous.

290
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,232
It needs to be on some T-shirt
or something, you ass.

291
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:30,520
No, it doesn't. It just catches on.
People just start saying it.

292
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,511
Blim-blam.

293
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,910
What? Blim-blam?

294
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,071
Somebody already said that.

295
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:42,715
Gentlemen, I don't suppose. . .

296
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,476
. . .any of you have written
anything lately.

297
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,631
An essay or something?

298
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,274
Something important?

299
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,192
No essays here, my man.

300
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:04,591
Okay. Stop putting your clothes
in the garbage disposal. . .

301
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,149
. . .and stop smoking.

302
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,310
Baby's on the half-tip.

303
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,834
-Snap!
-Yeah.

304
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,309
There you go. There you go.

305
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,629
Mr. Heep.

306
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,951
She told me a little bit more of the story
before she throw cushion at me.

307
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,269
Young-Soon.

308
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,758
You're not writing anything, are you?

309
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:35,276
A p-- P-- P-- Paper, maybe?

310
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,829
Writing? No, Mr. Heep.

311
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,074
This semester all multiple-choice
courses. Young-Soon is not stupid.

312
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,637
She told me about a bad guy in story.

313
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,997
These creatures are called scrunts.

314
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,709
They are meant to kill a narf
when she is out of the water.

315
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,440
They can lay completely flat.

316
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,194
Their back is covered in grass.

317
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,875
My great-grandmother said
that's why man never sees them.

318
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:07,191
They will appear
as a bump in the lawns.

319
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,479
Vick. Anna.

320
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,996
Mr. Heep, the light over my desk
is still not working.

321
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:04,277
I promise I'll get to it.
How's the writing?

322
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,910
-Slow.
-You look tired, Mr. Heep.

323
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,835
How long have you been writing, Vick?

324
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,077
Six months.

325
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,390
What? I should finish, right?

326
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,632
It just-- It just sits on his desk.
My brother's scared.

327
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,597
He'll do anything to get out of writing.

328
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,957
See this? It's the third load of laundry
he's done this week.

329
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:31,034
I can fix that light now, if you want.

330
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,432
A cookbook.

331
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,434
This has gotten s-- S--

332
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,238
Silly.

333
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,152
-That's not how you fold.
-Mr. Heep, tell her to stop annoying me.

334
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,514
I fixed the light.

335
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,557
I'll make you dinner, Mr. Heep.
Thank you.

336
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,073
You're both cooks?

337
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,279
Who, him? He can't cook.
He's banned from the kitchen.

338
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,991
Wait a minute,
I don't understand something.

339
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,594
I'm sorry. My-- My ladder. . .

340
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:54,272
. . .accidentally bumped into your desk.

341
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,830
I ended up seeing the title
of what it is you're writing.

342
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,592
It said <i>The Cookbook</i>.

343
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,910
I know, it's a bad title, right?

344
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,995
It's actually, you know, just my thoughts
on all our cultural problems. . .

345
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,276
. . .and thoughts on leaders and stuff.

346
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,318
I don't know who's gonna
wanna publish the thing.

347
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,195
That is not how you fold.

348
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,709
Your thoughts are very sad.

349
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,548
Most are of one night.

350
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:40,948
A night a man entered your home
when you were not there.

351
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,556
He stole many things
and killed your wife and children.

352
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:50,513
That is when you stopped being happy.

353
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,356
You were a doctor.

354
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,320
I am very sorry for you.

355
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,557
You believe you have no purpose.

356
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,190
You help all that live here.

357
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,113
Anybody can do this job, Story.

358
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,475
You have a purpose.

359
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,914
All beings have a purpose.

360
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,831
I know who you are.

361
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,629
And I think that I've found your vessel.

362
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,599
You know what I'm talking about, right?

363
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,475
He's outside.
Do you need to see him alone. . .

364
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,835
. . .or does he just need to see you?

365
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,836
Cover yourself up.

366
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,394
Hey.

367
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,028
Mr. Heep, I know I sent in that form.

368
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,475
-I gave it to you on the stairs.
-Okay.

369
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:05,750
-My sister's all angry at me now.
-Well, I'll check again.

370
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,760
By the way, this is my friend, Story.

371
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,233
Hi.

372
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,714
Yeah, you were right. Here it is.

373
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,399
Great.

374
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:40,438
You all right? You look a little. . . .

375
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,155
I'm feeling a little funny. It's nothing.

376
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:50,475
Is it a pins-and-needles kind of feeling?

377
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,598
Yeah, kind of.

378
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,079
Yeah.

379
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,955
Maybe you should go lie down.

380
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,312
Nice meeting you.

381
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,234
I'm so very happy we saw each other.

382
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:36,712
You don't have to leave right now,
do you?

383
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,957
I have to go finish a couple of things.
I'll be back.

384
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,678
Is that okay?

385
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,354
Your words are very beautiful.

386
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,754
Your heart is very big.

387
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:02,957
No one knows about my family here.

388
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:09,675
Please do not bring it up again.

389
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,593
Coming.

390
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:28,431
Sorry I'm late, Mrs. Bubchik.
It's-- It's been a long day.

391
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,919
Come on.

392
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,790
Listen, he's on the toilet.
He's been having some gas issues.

393
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,109
Don't tell him I told you.

394
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,078
I-- I thought the toilet was broken.
That's why I came.

395
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:44,711
He may just be looking in the mirror.
I mean, he's got this growth on his ass.

396
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,519
Don't tell him I told you.

397
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,476
Honey, Cleveland's here.
He's come to fix the toilet.

398
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,552
Tell him I had it fixed already.
I called the plumber this morning.

399
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:58,712
-Don't let it hurt his feelings.
-Right.

400
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,999
It's-- It's-- It's okay.

401
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,596
I should come when you call.
It's my job.

402
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:10,152
What if that thing's out there?
It'll try to get you?

403
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,039
There are laws. It will be safe.

404
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,668
I'm allowed to leave this night.

405
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,908
-How long do you think?
-It is time.

406
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,308
You must not watch.

407
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,835
Am I not allowed to watch you leave?

408
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,994
I won't watch.

409
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:36,152
Thank you for letting me wear
your beautiful shirt.

410
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,912
You keep it.

411
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,471
What happened?

412
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,268
Okay. Okay.

413
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:15,831
Hey. Calm down. Calm down.

414
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,036
How'd you get those scratches?

415
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,155
Did the eagle come?

416
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,713
Did something go wrong? Story.

417
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:29,156
Story. Was it that dog again?

418
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,799
What's happening?
I thought it was gonna be safe.

419
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:55,033
Your face doesn't look right.
Are you okay?

420
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,470
Mr. Heep is here. He has a friend.

421
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,358
She's beautiful.

422
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,670
She's not feeling that well:

423
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,592
So she's lying down in my room.

424
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,069
Why is she here?
Why isn't she at his place?

425
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,277
Well, she got sick
in the stairwell downstairs.

426
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:16,478
She's wearing no clothes
under his shirt.

427
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,993
Blim-blam.

428
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:22,917
Mr. Heep is a player.

429
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,479
-I hope it's all right.
-It's fine.

430
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,278
Do we need to take her to a hospital?

431
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,113
-Oh, no. No, no, no. That's f-- F-- F--
-Fine?

432
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,791
Thank you.

433
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,358
No, she just needs some rest.

434
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,750
She can stay here
as long as she needs to.

435
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,275
You started writing again?

436
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,673
Yeah.

437
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,708
I'll be right back. Okay?

438
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,998
Hello. M-- Mrs. Choi,
is Young-Soon at home?

439
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,479
No home.

440
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,279
Great. Unbelievable.

441
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,589
Hey. Hey.

442
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,159
Thanks.

443
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,549
-Yeah, hello?
-<i>Mr. Heep?</i>

444
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,109
-Where are you?
-<i>At a club.</i>

445
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,714
<i>Don 't tell my mother.</i>
<i>She thinks I'm at a dance class.</i>

446
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,108
Okay.

447
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:36,631
What happens if a narf gets scratched?

448
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,634
<i>I don 't know.</i>
<i>Put my mother on, I'll ask her.</i>

449
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,315
Mrs.-- Mrs. Choi. Mrs.--

450
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,709
-Hey.
-Hey. Thank you.

451
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:04,400
Oh, she-- She-- She--
She doesn't look happy.

452
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,074
<i>She said the story</i>
<i>her grandmother told...</i>

453
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:10,312
<i>...said a scrunt has poison</i>
<i>that kill narfs.</i>

454
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,553
<i>But she said</i>
<i>narfs can protect themselves.</i>

455
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:18,315
<i>They are given a mud called Kii</i>
<i>that cures them.</i>

456
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,710
<i>They keep it where they live.</i>

457
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,509
Okay, okay.

458
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:29,596
All right. Now, you said that the eagle
comes to take them back.

459
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,479
Right.
Now, what stops this green thing. . .

460
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:36,633
. . .from attacking them
when the eagle comes?

461
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,313
<i>You're funny, Mr. Heep.</i>

462
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,675
-Yeah, I know.
-<i>You really thought about this.</i>

463
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,956
<i>Put my mom on.</i>

464
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:06,393
-Hey.
-Yeah. Hey. I'm sorry.

465
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,114
Yes?

466
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:11,192
<i>She said only a rogue scrunt</i>
<i>will break the law of that night...</i>

467
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,112
<i>...because most scrunts are afraid.</i>

468
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,952
Afraid of what?

469
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:19,750
<i>Tartutic. They are the law keepers</i>
<i>in this bedtime story.</i>

470
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,639
<i>Her grandmother said</i>
<i>there are three of them...</i>

471
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,837
<i>...but they are called one name:</i>
<i>Tartutic.</i>

472
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,073
<i>They live in the trees.</i>
<i>They are said to look like monkeys.</i>

473
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:35,429
<i>No one knows for sure because</i>
<i>no one who has seen them has lived.</i>

474
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:39,479
<i>The legend says</i>
<i>that they were born so evil...</i>

475
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:43,030
<i>... that they killed their parents</i>
<i>on the night they were born.</i>

476
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:48,228
<i>The fear of them has kept justice</i>
<i>in The Blue World for centuries.</i>

477
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,277
<i>Bye, Mr. Heep.</i>

478
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,033
Thanks.

479
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,509
<i>They are given a mud called Kii</i>
<i>that cures them.</i>

480
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,910
<i>They keep it where they live.</i>

481
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,997
My mom figured out I was at a club.
She made me come home.

482
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,878
She tell me more of the story.

483
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:20,634
-Why you wet?
-That's-- Apartment business.

484
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:26,958
Listen, Mr. Heep,
my mother thinks of you as stranger.

485
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:30,596
You have to make her
see you as a child, innocent.

486
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:33,593
Then she will tell you the bedtime story.

487
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:36,269
There is a reason
the rules might be broken.

488
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,959
<i>A Thousand Narfs</i> is about a rare narf. . .

489
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:42,395
. . .who comes once
in a generation of narfs. . .

490
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:45,438
. . .who is called the Madam Narf.

491
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:48,956
Her vessel is important.
This vessel will cause change.

492
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:53,750
But it is the Madam Narf herself
that is truly the key.

493
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:57,276
She's considered
a queen to her people.

494
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:01,035
Her return will be seen
as a great inspiration.

495
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:04,590
A scrunt will do anything
to kill a Madam Narf. . .

496
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:07,354
. . .even forget his fears of the Tartutic.

497
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:10,751
He might break the rules for that,
Mr. Heep.

498
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:14,194
Will she know
that she's a Madam Narf?

499
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:17,830
No, that is moral of bedtime story.

500
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,912
No one is ever told who they are.

501
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:22,957
I think we are linked.

502
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:25,554
It's more than just a story to me too.

503
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:28,109
I actually want to believe it.

504
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,878
Goodbye, Mr. Heep.

505
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:49,028
You have saved my life again.

506
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:52,830
You made that room.

507
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:59,034
The cracks that I saw. Is that room
supposed to collapse eventually?

508
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:02,510
I'm not allowed to speak
of The Blue World.

509
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:05,274
Well, the door needs a little work.

510
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:11,155
I noticed that you took things
from the apartment. . .

511
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:13,754
. . .that people left around the pool.

512
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:19,670
That's how I saw you.
You were taking something off of a chair.

513
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:29,630
I think I might know why
the scrunt needs to get you so bad.

514
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,394
Why did he break the rules tonight?

515
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:36,394
As it turns out,
I think that you're someone. . .

516
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:40,270
. . .very important to everyone.

517
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:21,269
I tried to tell them about you.
I don't know if I did the right thing.

518
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:24,155
I'm not sure how they're gonna react.

519
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:26,197
I trust you.

520
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:29,119
I believe you are here to protect me.

521
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,032
Is the Kii working?

522
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,156
Yes, thank you.

523
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:40,913
If it is true that I am. . . .

524
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:43,310
He will keep coming after me.

525
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:46,153
I will not be safe until. . . .

526
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:48,550
Until Tartutic comes.

527
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:05,033
My mother said she saw a ghost once,
in the basement.

528
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,714
I was the only one who believed her.

529
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:10,235
She's not an apparition, Anna.

530
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:14,155
I don't know who you are. . .

531
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:17,675
. . .but you did something to me.

532
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:21,671
My thoughts.

533
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,989
Everything became clearer.

534
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:33,113
The fears that were muddling
my thoughts just went away.

535
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:35,916
I can hear myself.

536
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,754
Do you wish to know your future?

537
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:49,472
A boy in the Midwest of this land. . .

538
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:53,872
. . .will grow up in a home where your book
will be on the shelf and spoken of often.

539
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:57,112
He will grow up
with these ideas in his head.

540
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:00,478
He will grow into a great orator.

541
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:03,873
He will speak and his words
will be heard throughout this land. . .

542
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:06,235
. . .and throughout the world.

543
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,118
This boy will become
leader of this country. . .

544
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:14,033
. . .and begin a movement
of great change.

545
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:17,672
He will speak of you and your words.

546
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:22,069
Your book will be the seeds
of many of his great thoughts.

547
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,720
It will be the seeds of change.

548
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,156
<i>The Cookbook?</i>

549
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:41,599
One, two, three.

550
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:16,198
Oh, jeez.

551
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:29,475
Could you tell her that I was interested
in hearing more of the story?

552
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:03,672
Tell her it's a beautiful story.

553
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:08,157
Are there-- Are there any parts
that might be good to hear?

554
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:32,796
-How is she?
-The medicine's helping her.

555
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:35,758
I told her to stay under the shower.
She does better with water.

556
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:38,832
I need to talk with her.
And Vick should be there too.

557
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:44,432
I told them to wait right outside.
I'll tell them what you have to say.

558
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:48,636
Tell her I know that she is not allowed
to tell about her world. . .

559
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:52,918
. . .but maybe I could ask some questions,
and she can just say if it's right or wrong.

560
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:57,439
Know what I did when I was little and me
and my girlfriends would get in trouble?

561
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:59,670
My mom always wanted to know
what happened. . .

562
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:01,956
. . .but I was like,
"I can't tell on my friends. "

563
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:06,352
So she came up with this way
of me telling her things without talking.

564
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:10,399
She would say, "Touch your ear
or something if the answer is yes. "

565
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:12,994
So I would, and then
she would know certain things. . .

566
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:16,038
. . .but I didn't really feel
like I told on my friends.

567
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:20,556
It was cheating, I know,
but made me feel better.

568
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:22,189
We're ready.

569
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:28,152
So in this bedtime story. . .

570
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:31,357
. . .the narf has come
to a preordained place.

571
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:34,910
She must leave from the same spot.

572
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:37,719
This eagle, the Great Eatlon,
coming to take her back. . .

573
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:39,359
. . .is really very important.

574
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,431
And here's the good stuff.

575
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:45,354
There are humans
with powers that can help her.

576
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:47,954
And these people
have been unconsciously drawn. . .

577
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:50,190
. . .to live near the vessel.

578
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:52,794
Now, these humans
don't know who they are. . .

579
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:56,032
. . .and they always
appear in the story earlier.

580
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:58,873
Are there humans with powers
that can help you. . .

581
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,553
. . .but don't know who they are?

582
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:03,029
That's a yes!

583
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:09,551
They've got weird names:
a Symbolist, a Guardian and a Guild.

584
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:10,835
Ask her if that's right.

585
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:15,996
You want something.

586
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:19,394
One of them. Vick.

587
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:24,076
Mr. Heep. Mr. Heep is one of them.

588
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,953
Which one? Guild, Guardian?

589
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:32,190
She thinks Mr. Heep is the Guardian.

590
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:36,757
I was told that there's a Symbolist. . .

591
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:40,151
. . .an interpreter who can read signs
in clouds and other forms.

592
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:42,550
He will interpret messages. . .

593
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:46,193
. . .from the universe
if problems should arise.

594
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:49,352
Do you know who the Symbolist
or Interpreter is?

595
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,677
That's a no.

596
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:55,674
And I was told that there is a Guild. . .

597
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:58,513
. . .whose many hands
will combine to help.

598
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:00,511
Does she know who they are?

599
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:02,796
There is a Guild or something.

600
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,633
They're supposed to help
with their hands.

601
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:08,151
That's another no.

602
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,034
All right, there's one other.

603
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:14,670
I don't know if it's worth mentioning.
It's not in the stories all the time.

604
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:18,196
It's a human, usually a female. . .

605
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:19,998
. . .so full of hope. . .

606
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:24,790
. . .that they can awaken
the life force in all things.

607
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:27,030
Now, that one is called the Healer.

608
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,270
And you can tell
that they're in the story. . .

609
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:32,273
. . .because butterflies
are drawn to the Healer.

610
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:36,714
-Butterflies.
-The last one's a Healer.

611
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:39,348
You don't know
any of these people, do you?

612
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:47,837
Reading? A book?

613
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,831
Learning.

614
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:53,676
She thinks it has to be learned.

615
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:56,035
Is the eagle
going to come back for her?

616
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:00,679
Only one last time.

617
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,236
Mr. Heep,
you know the people in this building.

618
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:04,958
You have to find them.

619
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:13,599
What is it?

620
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,876
You know these walls are paper-thin?

621
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:19,271
I can hear all that bloody noise
downstairs like they were in my kitchen.

622
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,635
Can you do anything about that?

623
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:25,152
Of course not.

624
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:29,719
-What is it you want, anyway?
-Well, I had a question.

625
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:33,714
You're an expert on p-- P-- Plots, right?

626
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:38,476
You know who's gonna do what in a book
or a movie even at the beginning, yes?

627
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:41,871
There is no originality left in the world,
Mr. Heep.

628
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:43,996
That is a sad fact I've come to live with.

629
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:48,517
Well, if there was a mystery. . .

630
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:51,911
. . .and a guy had to figure out
who some people were. . .

631
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:55,197
. . .like he had to find a symbol guy. . .

632
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:58,397
. . .someone who can
figure out messages. . .

633
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:04,237
. . .and a guild of people who are going
to be important at the end as a group.

634
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:06,995
How would you figure that out?

635
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:10,919
The symbol person should be simple.

636
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:14,676
Look for any character
who is doing something mundane. . .

637
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:16,478
. . .but required analysis.

638
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:19,871
Someone who was skilled at puzzles.

639
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:22,235
Joey, you can't have cereal for lunch.

640
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:26,313
This picture on the cereal box
is supposed to make you feel happy.

641
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:30,554
I feel sad, like that time
you forgot to pick me up at school.

642
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:36,068
Joey, Mr. Heep appears disquieted.
Can you give us a moment alone?

643
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,631
Sure, Dad.

644
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,957
<i>As for the guild...</i>

645
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:45,112
. . .look for any group of characters
that are always seen together. . .

646
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:48,033
. . .and have seemingly irrelevant
and tedious dialogue. . .

647
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:50,395
. . .that seems to regurgitate forever.

648
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:53,791
And you just sit around
and talk about nothing?

649
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:56,713
Oh, we talk about serious issues.

650
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,552
On occasion.

651
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:05,589
We talked about Martin Luther King
at the Tequila Hut Tuesday night.

652
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:08,839
You talked about that?

653
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,833
<i>This is the writer's way</i>
<i>of establishing characters...</i>

654
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,753
<i>... who will be important</i>
<i>further in the story.</i>

655
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:18,112
Is there anything further
I can assist you with during my naptime?

656
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:21,955
No. No, Mr. Farber. Thank you.

657
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:39,678
Story, these young men are the Guild.

658
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:42,752
And Mr. Dury-- Mr. Dury?

659
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:46,634
Mr. Dury is the Interpreter.

660
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:51,629
And there's one other person.
Mrs. Bell, could you come in here, please?

661
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:55,915
This is Mrs. Bell, the Healer.

662
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:00,277
Story wants to go home and she can't.

663
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:02,874
Tomorrow night is her last chance.

664
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:05,796
Mr. Dury, please step forward.

665
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:10,192
-Mr. Heep, you're not stuttering.
-Yes, I know. I know. It's only around her.

666
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:16,974
Now, the Interpreter will tell us what
to do if something should go wrong.

667
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:20,929
He will use an instrument
specific to him. . .

668
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:22,898
. . .to interpret.

669
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:26,133
-Try it, Mr. Dury.
-I don't--

670
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:28,690
Let's just see what happens.

671
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:32,139
I think that there's
a message in there for us.

672
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:41,296
Well, nine letters across
is the word "essential. "

673
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:45,980
And it touches. . .

674
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:50,852
. . .27 down, which is "scheme. "

675
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:53,216
-Essential scheme.
-Yes.

676
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:56,532
Now, those were the first two words
that I deciphered in this puzzle. . .

677
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:59,932
. . .and I thought that was--
Well, I thought that was weird.

678
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:06,531
There's a word that seems
out of place to me.

679
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:10,137
-Yes.
-It's a six-letter word for "get-together. "

680
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:12,098
-"Soiree. "
-Soiree.

681
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:15,733
Soiree could mean "party. " How
could a--? How does a party help us?

682
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:18,574
Well, I guess I thought that, you know. . .

683
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:23,690
. . .a party is interesting because
this thing out there is an animal. . .

684
01:02:23,860 --> 01:02:26,329
. . .and it probably has
a very keen sense of smell.

685
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:30,176
-Why is everyone staring at me?
-Go on. Go on, Mr. Dury. Go on.

686
01:02:30,340 --> 01:02:33,936
Humans have a pungent smell
to animals. . .

687
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:37,332
. . .so I thought that maybe everyone
gathered together would confuse him. . .

688
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:41,096
. . .and he wouldn't be able to distinguish
her from amongst all of us.

689
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:42,296
Does that sound right?

690
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:44,975
He's hearing the voice of God
through a crossword puzzle.

691
01:02:45,140 --> 01:02:48,053
-We're just playing here, right?
-No. Wait, wait.

692
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:52,620
See, I don't think that the Great Eatlon. . .

693
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:56,410
. . .will land in the presence
of beings not from its world.

694
01:02:56,740 --> 01:02:59,539
She didn't want me to watch
when the eagle came the first time.

695
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:01,737
That's before she knew
that I was the Guardian.

696
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:03,573
Would I be able to watch now?

697
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:08,532
But there will be--
There'll be hundreds of people at a party.

698
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:12,216
It won't work. It won't work. See if
there's anything else in there, Mr. Dury.

699
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:16,693
This word did give me great difficulty,
and then it came to me.

700
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:20,217
-"Sonorous. "
-Sonorous, sonorous.

701
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:23,214
It could mean music, a band.

702
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:27,613
Maybe we gather everyone inside
at the last minute to hear a band. . .

703
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:31,091
. . .and we who are of the world
stay with her. . .

704
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:34,890
. . .to help her with that thing and. . . .

705
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:36,733
Until she's taken.

706
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:39,419
He's a prophet.

707
01:03:39,580 --> 01:03:42,618
We're all just seeing what we want to.
I just made all that up.

708
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:45,375
No, I think that it worked.
I think that it worked.

709
01:03:45,540 --> 01:03:48,135
That is why they're the Guild.

710
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:52,180
I think they're supposed
to use their hands to throw us a party.

711
01:03:52,340 --> 01:03:54,696
-Is he serious?
-We're gonna throw a party.

712
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:58,771
-Huge party. We are serious.
-Tell them--

713
01:03:58,940 --> 01:04:01,933
Anything you can do for us,
all right? Tables. . . .

714
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:05,491
We definitely need a band. It's like
the most important thing. Oh, my God.

715
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:14,814
You don't think this is gonna work,
do you?

716
01:04:16,540 --> 01:04:18,452
I'm nervous too.

717
01:04:19,340 --> 01:04:21,901
You being out there tomorrow night.

718
01:04:22,340 --> 01:04:25,413
Me not knowing what to do
as the Guardian.

719
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:31,580
Think I can go out there tonight
and maybe face that thing without you?

720
01:04:32,740 --> 01:04:34,971
Get a little practice with him?

721
01:04:35,140 --> 01:04:37,018
Scare him, maybe?

722
01:04:37,180 --> 01:04:39,092
Show him who's boss?

723
01:04:42,580 --> 01:04:44,890
I know you wanna get home.

724
01:04:53,780 --> 01:04:55,817
You will need a mirror.

725
01:04:56,620 --> 01:04:58,976
<i>Can you hear me? I'm here.</i>

726
01:04:59,420 --> 01:05:01,616
Peer over your shoulder carefully.

727
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:06,297
It is only through a mirror that one can
see the eyes of a scrunt in the grass.

728
01:05:06,460 --> 01:05:11,137
It will appear to you
as two red spots in the darkness.

729
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:15,056
<i>Yeah, I-- I don 't-- I....</i>

730
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:18,060
Wait.

731
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:20,333
I see him.

732
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:25,901
The Guardian has instincts
of when the scrunt will attack.

733
01:05:26,060 --> 01:05:28,780
He is a great weapon against him.

734
01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:33,414
You should walk backwards
towards him.

735
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:36,539
When you are close enough
to be certain of his position. . .

736
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:39,169
. . .turn and face the hidden scrunt.

737
01:05:43,580 --> 01:05:45,458
I'm facing him.

738
01:05:46,540 --> 01:05:48,418
<i>I am scared.</i>

739
01:05:48,860 --> 01:05:51,534
<i>It is about to get very dangerous.</i>

740
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:53,539
Okay.

741
01:05:55,260 --> 01:05:56,979
I'm ready.

742
01:05:57,900 --> 01:06:02,770
You must invoke the ancient words
"<i>Nef Ra Mora</i>. "

743
01:06:02,940 --> 01:06:08,015
It is a command to rise
and a challenge to fight.

744
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:18,538
<i>What is happening?</i>

745
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:22,451
He's rising out of the grass.

746
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:27,058
His legs are bending and coiling. . .

747
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:29,573
. . .underneath him.

748
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:33,854
Oh, my God. Oh, my-- Oh, no.

749
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:35,940
<i>He's standing in front of me.</i>

750
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:37,739
The Guardian can hypnotize a scrunt.

751
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:40,369
If the Guardian looks directly
into the scrunt's eyes. . .

752
01:06:40,540 --> 01:06:44,011
. . .it will be compelled to stay frozen
or move backwards.

753
01:06:44,540 --> 01:06:47,260
What is the J.G. scrunt's reaction?
Is he frightened?

754
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:48,854
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

755
01:06:49,020 --> 01:06:51,057
-Look into his eyes.
-<i>I am.</i>

756
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:53,689
-Is he moving away?
-<i>No.</i>

757
01:06:53,860 --> 01:06:55,897
The Guardian can control his mind.

758
01:06:56,060 --> 01:06:58,814
The J.G. scrunt will not
be able to attack.

759
01:06:59,100 --> 01:07:03,572
-Okay.
-<i>You must look into his eyes.</i>

760
01:07:03,740 --> 01:07:05,413
I think something's wrong.

761
01:07:05,580 --> 01:07:07,572
<i>He's stepping forward.</i>

762
01:07:08,180 --> 01:07:09,694
He's stepping forward?

763
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:11,772
Something's wrong!

764
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:16,535
Cleveland, run!

765
01:07:22,220 --> 01:07:25,418
What is it you are doing?

766
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:28,613
Hey there.

767
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:35,216
Anything I can do for you there,
Mr. F-- F-- F-- Farber?

768
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:37,094
No.

769
01:07:43,780 --> 01:07:47,410
So how was the m-- Movie?

770
01:07:47,580 --> 01:07:49,173
-Sucked.
-Oh, what a-- What a shame.

771
01:07:49,340 --> 01:07:52,856
Characters were walking around
saying their thoughts out loud.

772
01:07:53,020 --> 01:07:54,534
Who does that?

773
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:55,895
And a typical romance. . .

774
01:07:56,060 --> 01:08:00,100
. . .where the couple finally tell each other
they love one another in the rain.

775
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:04,694
Why does everyone like to stand around
and talk in the rain in movies?

776
01:08:05,260 --> 01:08:07,331
Well, maybe. . . .

777
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:11,780
Maybe it's a metaphor for purification,
starting new.

778
01:08:12,860 --> 01:08:15,580
No. It's not.

779
01:08:16,060 --> 01:08:17,892
Are you okay?

780
01:08:19,580 --> 01:08:22,573
He'll choose to move
only when no one is looking.

781
01:08:22,740 --> 01:08:24,777
They're masters of hiding.

782
01:08:24,940 --> 01:08:28,695
A scrunt will hide unless
he cannot hide in his environment.

783
01:08:28,860 --> 01:08:31,773
If a tenant hadn't walked by. . .

784
01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:34,455
. . .I'd have been eaten alive.

785
01:08:36,180 --> 01:08:38,649
I had no powers over him.

786
01:08:38,820 --> 01:08:41,130
You are not the Guardian.

787
01:08:42,580 --> 01:08:44,936
I do not understand.

788
01:08:50,940 --> 01:08:53,375
I cannot protect you.

789
01:08:54,220 --> 01:08:56,496
Where are the Tartutic?

790
01:08:56,660 --> 01:08:58,936
Why isn't he being punished?

791
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:02,090
Where is the justice?

792
01:09:20,140 --> 01:09:22,496
How come you don't ask
about bedtime story anymore?

793
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:28,213
I've been busy.

794
01:09:33,780 --> 01:09:36,579
You-- You coming to the party tonight?

795
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:38,693
I have to study.

796
01:09:38,860 --> 01:09:40,613
Bye, Mr. Heep.

797
01:09:46,900 --> 01:09:50,052
Mr. Leeds,
did you hear about the p-- Party?

798
01:09:54,340 --> 01:09:55,535
You coming?

799
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:57,498
<i>--a picture here</i>
<i>of the enemy they're....</i>

800
01:09:57,660 --> 01:09:59,891
Does man deserve to be saved,
Mr. Heep?

801
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:02,097
-What?
-Man.

802
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:06,894
Yes.

803
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:09,059
That's not the answer I expected.

804
01:10:09,220 --> 01:10:12,691
Why'd you a-- Ask me that?

805
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:15,137
I know about your family.

806
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:18,454
I looked you up
when you started working here.

807
01:10:19,180 --> 01:10:21,376
I know someone killed them.

808
01:10:21,540 --> 01:10:25,853
But you can't give up.
You can't hide here, son.

809
01:10:27,340 --> 01:10:28,820
I know.

810
01:10:28,980 --> 01:10:31,290
You don't wanna become like me.

811
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:36,255
By the way, your invitation would sound
more real if it had the guy's name on it.

812
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:39,369
There's something strange going on
around this building.

813
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:41,338
Don't think I haven't noticed.

814
01:10:48,260 --> 01:10:49,853
It is finished?

815
01:10:52,860 --> 01:10:55,295
You can see things in the future?

816
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:57,372
Some things.

817
01:10:57,860 --> 01:11:00,216
I have a question to ask you.

818
01:11:01,020 --> 01:11:04,172
I will do my best to answer it.

819
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:06,457
You'll tell me the truth, right?

820
01:11:07,820 --> 01:11:09,300
Yes.

821
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:13,691
Change doesn't happen the way
you say it's gonna happen. . .

822
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:17,331
. . .without dramatic events
that accelerate thinking.

823
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:19,529
I wrote this thing.

824
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:23,216
It might take decades or longer
to create a reaction. . .

825
01:11:23,660 --> 01:11:26,573
. . .before it anchors
in the consciousness.

826
01:11:27,220 --> 01:11:30,736
That's not the type of change
you're telling me is gonna happen, right?

827
01:11:32,460 --> 01:11:35,339
I was wondering
why he didn't meet me. . .

828
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:38,855
. . .this leader who's just a boy.

829
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:43,778
If he was so inspired by my words,
why didn't he try to meet me?

830
01:11:44,980 --> 01:11:48,860
There's a lot of things in <i>The Cookbook</i>
people won't like to hear.

831
01:11:51,260 --> 01:11:56,335
I'm not anything, you know?
I don't think I'm anything special.

832
01:11:56,500 --> 01:11:59,538
So I started thinking,
"How is this gonna happen?

833
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:03,489
Why are people gonna suddenly
take me seriously?

834
01:12:04,380 --> 01:12:06,576
And why didn't he meet me?"

835
01:12:09,660 --> 01:12:12,095
And I thought of how it could happen.

836
01:12:12,540 --> 01:12:17,296
Story, I wanted to ask you,
is something gonna happen to me?

837
01:12:18,460 --> 01:12:21,692
Is someone gonna kill me
because I write this?

838
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:23,733
Yes.

839
01:12:24,220 --> 01:12:27,736
Man thinks they're each alone
in this world.

840
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:30,017
It is not true.

841
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:32,811
You are all connected.

842
01:12:33,340 --> 01:12:36,856
One act can one day affect all.

843
01:12:41,820 --> 01:12:45,097
What are you guys whispering about?

844
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:48,173
Is he trying to get you to tell him
how many kids he's gonna have?

845
01:12:48,340 --> 01:12:51,299
I told him eight, all bratty boys.

846
01:12:51,460 --> 01:12:54,453
I asked her if she knew the name
of the deaf, dumb and blind guy. . .

847
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:56,213
. . .that's gonna marry you.

848
01:12:56,380 --> 01:12:59,418
Very funny, Herb.

849
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:11,574
Okay.

850
01:13:13,220 --> 01:13:15,496
Don't tell my sister.

851
01:13:45,340 --> 01:13:49,050
Hi. I'm Mr. Farber.

852
01:13:50,940 --> 01:13:53,296
I wanted to thank you.

853
01:13:53,740 --> 01:13:58,576
I was completely surprised by all of this.

854
01:13:59,020 --> 01:14:02,934
I was expecting some kind of greeting,
of course.

855
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:07,179
But this is beyond my expectations.

856
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:11,492
I'm 13B.

857
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:15,413
-Oh, yeah. How you doing? What's up?
-Oh, yeah. Good for you.

858
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:19,859
I know of your future, Cleveland.

859
01:14:20,340 --> 01:14:22,332
Do you wanna hear it?

860
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:23,900
No.

861
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:29,970
Tell me what happens
when the eagle takes you back.

862
01:14:30,380 --> 01:14:33,373
It is only what I have been told
by others.

863
01:14:33,820 --> 01:14:38,941
They tell us the world will line up
and reveal we are on the right path. . .

864
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:41,376
. . .that the universe will give us signs.

865
01:14:42,180 --> 01:14:44,331
The Tartutic could have not come yet.

866
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:47,732
I can still sense
the scrunt's presence near.

867
01:14:48,220 --> 01:14:53,136
You have to believe
that this all makes sense somehow.

868
01:14:56,380 --> 01:14:59,100
I don't know why I'm the Madam Narf.

869
01:14:59,260 --> 01:15:04,130
I'm not special. I'm clumsy.
They make fun of me.

870
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:06,610
I don't know how to lead.

871
01:15:08,260 --> 01:15:12,140
Do you get sick
every time you break a rule?

872
01:15:12,820 --> 01:15:16,018
Every time that you tell me
something that you shouldn't?

873
01:15:19,060 --> 01:15:21,529
There's a storm coming.

874
01:15:25,100 --> 01:15:29,014
-I am scared.
-It's okay to be scared.

875
01:15:29,340 --> 01:15:31,809
I do not have courage.

876
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:34,497
I do not want to be a Madam Narf.

877
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:36,891
You do what you think is right.

878
01:15:37,060 --> 01:15:39,416
You are very brave.

879
01:15:40,260 --> 01:15:43,537
You were always meant to lead, Story.

880
01:15:46,540 --> 01:15:48,259
Cleveland. . .

881
01:15:49,580 --> 01:15:52,141
. . .the Great Eatlon is coming.

882
01:17:01,780 --> 01:17:03,134
Okay.

883
01:17:06,660 --> 01:17:08,856
I'm glad you read my journal.

884
01:17:09,940 --> 01:17:13,490
Don't worry. We're all watching you.

885
01:17:46,140 --> 01:17:49,099
Oh, come on.
The music should have started already.

886
01:17:50,740 --> 01:17:53,255
Do not leave this spot.

887
01:17:55,820 --> 01:17:57,891
-Yo, come on.
-Hey.

888
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:08,257
Find a mirror.

889
01:19:00,060 --> 01:19:03,133
Why hasn't the m-- Music started?

890
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:06,611
It's been working smooth.
We've been playing with it all night.

891
01:19:07,900 --> 01:19:10,096
You used up the battery.

892
01:19:10,340 --> 01:19:12,059
Wave to him.

893
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:23,496
They told her that the universe
would line up. . .

894
01:19:23,660 --> 01:19:27,415
. . .and reveal that we're
on the right p-- Path.

895
01:19:27,780 --> 01:19:29,897
Why isn't this working?

896
01:19:56,540 --> 01:19:58,054
Okay.

897
01:20:10,860 --> 01:20:14,137
Sometimes animals just look dead.

898
01:20:18,620 --> 01:20:22,614
Something went wrong.
They took her inside, up by the pool.

899
01:20:51,420 --> 01:20:54,254
It is not time for you to go.

900
01:20:56,460 --> 01:21:00,818
It is not time for you to go.

901
01:21:08,060 --> 01:21:10,859
Isn't this supposed to work?

902
01:21:15,100 --> 01:21:18,411
Fourteen across.

903
01:21:20,380 --> 01:21:21,939
No. No.

904
01:21:26,740 --> 01:21:28,413
I don't know.

905
01:21:29,900 --> 01:21:31,619
I don't know.

906
01:21:34,900 --> 01:21:39,258
This world is about finding
your purpose, right?

907
01:21:39,420 --> 01:21:43,573
And the only way to do that is to find
your own voice. You told us that.

908
01:21:44,060 --> 01:21:47,417
I don't feel like an Interpreter.

909
01:21:47,980 --> 01:21:51,098
Is it possible that that isn't my purpose?

910
01:21:52,380 --> 01:21:56,499
I mean, I don't see anything
in these words, and I didn't before.

911
01:21:59,180 --> 01:22:01,649
And finding one's purpose
is a profound thing.

912
01:22:01,820 --> 01:22:04,699
Sometimes it isn't always
what it seems.

913
01:22:08,060 --> 01:22:09,938
What if these young men
are not the Guild?

914
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:11,614
Look at what happened at the party.

915
01:22:11,780 --> 01:22:14,090
These things haven't seemed right
from the beginning.

916
01:22:14,260 --> 01:22:17,731
Why are you so certain that I am
the Interpreter and they are the Guild?

917
01:22:22,260 --> 01:22:24,695
He was so sure.

918
01:22:24,860 --> 01:22:26,214
What?

919
01:22:26,660 --> 01:22:28,253
I. . .

920
01:22:29,580 --> 01:22:31,776
. . .asked someone.

921
01:22:31,940 --> 01:22:34,091
He acted like he knew.

922
01:22:34,260 --> 01:22:36,138
What kind of person
would be so arrogant. . .

923
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:38,940
. . .to presume to know the intention
of another human being?

924
01:22:39,100 --> 01:22:41,092
Who put this young girl's life
in jeopardy?

925
01:22:47,940 --> 01:22:49,613
Hello?

926
01:22:56,700 --> 01:22:59,898
Is the bathroom on this level working?

927
01:23:02,140 --> 01:23:04,336
A dog inside the building.

928
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:07,334
Go. Shoo!

929
01:23:12,460 --> 01:23:14,133
Why, you're not a dog at all.

930
01:23:17,700 --> 01:23:19,293
My God.

931
01:23:19,900 --> 01:23:22,859
This is like a moment
from a horror movie.

932
01:23:24,540 --> 01:23:27,613
It is precisely the moment
where the mutation or beast. . .

933
01:23:27,780 --> 01:23:31,296
. . .will attempt to kill
an unlikable side character.

934
01:23:31,460 --> 01:23:35,454
But in stories where there
has been no prior cursing, nudity. . .

935
01:23:35,620 --> 01:23:38,693
. . .killing or death,
such as in a family film. . .

936
01:23:38,860 --> 01:23:42,615
. . .the unlikable character
will narrowly escape his encounter. . .

937
01:23:42,780 --> 01:23:45,056
. . .and be referenced again
later in the story. . .

938
01:23:45,220 --> 01:23:48,258
. . .having learned valuable lessons.

939
01:23:48,820 --> 01:23:50,618
He may even be given
a humorous moment. . .

940
01:23:50,780 --> 01:23:53,693
. . .to allow the audience
to feel good about him.

941
01:23:55,780 --> 01:23:58,693
This is where I turn to run.

942
01:23:58,860 --> 01:24:01,170
You will leap for me.

943
01:24:01,340 --> 01:24:03,252
I will shut the door.

944
01:24:03,420 --> 01:24:07,733
And you will land
a fraction of a second too late.

945
01:24:10,860 --> 01:24:12,613
Why would they lie to her
about Tartutic?

946
01:24:12,780 --> 01:24:16,137
These cannot just be fairy tales
they tell to make the narfs risk their lives.

947
01:24:16,300 --> 01:24:17,700
This has gotta be about faith.

948
01:24:17,860 --> 01:24:20,773
Her world works by different rules
than ours. She may not be dead.

949
01:24:20,940 --> 01:24:23,774
-We need to be told what to do.
-We need to find the Interpreter.

950
01:24:23,940 --> 01:24:26,375
How are we suddenly
going to realize someone's purpose?

951
01:24:26,540 --> 01:24:29,817
This is someone doing something ancient.
An ancient thing in modern times.

952
01:24:29,980 --> 01:24:32,700
It could be someone who sees purity
in what we see as mundane.

953
01:24:32,860 --> 01:24:34,772
Sees the voice of God
in the ordinary.

954
01:24:34,940 --> 01:24:37,011
He is someone who sees meaning
in the ordinary.

955
01:24:37,180 --> 01:24:40,537
Does anyone have any idea
who this is?

956
01:24:42,620 --> 01:24:44,100
My God.

957
01:24:46,140 --> 01:24:47,540
I do.

958
01:24:48,580 --> 01:24:50,697
There is a message.

959
01:24:53,260 --> 01:24:55,570
There is a ceremony to be done.

960
01:24:55,740 --> 01:24:57,936
You're doing great, Joey.

961
01:24:59,820 --> 01:25:04,133
The hands of the Guild will be needed,
plus two others.

962
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:07,020
Joey, who is the Guild?

963
01:25:09,300 --> 01:25:12,532
It is a ceremony of seven sisters.

964
01:25:12,700 --> 01:25:15,135
Sisters? The Guild is women?

965
01:25:16,380 --> 01:25:19,259
They will touch together
with their hearts as one. . .

966
01:25:19,420 --> 01:25:21,776
. . .to bring strength to the moment.

967
01:25:21,940 --> 01:25:23,693
Nice, Joey.

968
01:25:26,140 --> 01:25:28,860
You will need a man
who has no secrets. . .

969
01:25:29,020 --> 01:25:32,650
. . .and one whose opinion
is highly respected as witnesses.

970
01:25:34,020 --> 01:25:38,617
All must hurry.
This will all be over in moments.

971
01:26:07,060 --> 01:26:09,450
Mr. Perez de la Torre.

972
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:15,255
I need to speak with your
f-- F-- F-- F-- Five daughters.

973
01:26:19,660 --> 01:26:23,574
Honey? Honey,
there's some people here to see you.

974
01:26:30,340 --> 01:26:31,774
Sweetheart?

975
01:26:33,340 --> 01:26:35,650
He's probably rinsing his mouth.

976
01:26:35,820 --> 01:26:37,652
He's got terrible breath.

977
01:26:37,820 --> 01:26:40,255
Don't tell him I told you.

978
01:26:54,060 --> 01:26:57,849
<i>--huge explosions</i>
<i>right in the very heart of the capital.</i>

979
01:26:58,020 --> 01:27:03,049
<i>Several explosions, I felt at least four</i>
<i>very close to the center of the city.</i>

980
01:28:07,820 --> 01:28:10,255
I think we have everybody.

981
01:28:13,020 --> 01:28:16,900
A man who has no secrets. . .

982
01:28:17,060 --> 01:28:22,294
. . .and one whose opinion
I greatly respect.

983
01:28:22,460 --> 01:28:26,454
They will be w-- W-- Witnesses.

984
01:28:26,620 --> 01:28:30,819
Will the Guild please come forward?

985
01:28:35,260 --> 01:28:36,774
Yeah.

986
01:28:37,940 --> 01:28:39,852
And you make seven.

987
01:28:40,540 --> 01:28:42,452
Seven sisters.

988
01:28:44,860 --> 01:28:46,692
Come, come.

989
01:28:48,940 --> 01:28:50,374
Yeah.

990
01:28:51,100 --> 01:28:53,296
Everything's right now.

991
01:28:57,860 --> 01:29:00,011
Come back to us now.

992
01:29:01,100 --> 01:29:05,094
Come back to us now, honey.
Come back to us.

993
01:29:11,740 --> 01:29:12,890
I can't believe it.

994
01:29:13,060 --> 01:29:16,736
This is crazy. This woman
is probably dying as we're talking.

995
01:29:16,900 --> 01:29:18,459
She needs to get to a hospital.

996
01:29:18,620 --> 01:29:22,660
This is not right. We can't just stand here
playing make-believe.

997
01:29:22,820 --> 01:29:25,494
I wanted to believe more than most.

998
01:29:26,060 --> 01:29:28,370
I wanna be like a child again.

999
01:29:28,860 --> 01:29:31,739
I needed to believe there's more
than this awfulness around us. . .

1000
01:29:31,900 --> 01:29:33,539
. . .but at some point we have to stop.

1001
01:29:33,700 --> 01:29:38,650
Mr. Leeds, it is time to prove
some stories are real.

1002
01:29:39,700 --> 01:29:41,657
I read it wrong.

1003
01:29:46,380 --> 01:29:48,053
It was my first time.

1004
01:29:48,220 --> 01:29:51,099
I thought it said, "She will lead
a ceremony of seven sisters. . .

1005
01:29:51,260 --> 01:29:53,491
. . .to bring strength to the moment. "

1006
01:29:54,140 --> 01:29:57,690
I looked at it again. It says "he. "

1007
01:29:57,860 --> 01:30:03,413
"He will lead a ceremony of seven sisters
to bring strength to the moment. "

1008
01:30:03,580 --> 01:30:06,732
Mrs. Bell is not the Healer.

1009
01:30:06,900 --> 01:30:09,017
It said the Healer could be a man.

1010
01:30:09,180 --> 01:30:11,615
But I-- But I--
I saw a butterfly land right on her.

1011
01:30:11,780 --> 01:30:12,850
Butterflies?

1012
01:30:13,020 --> 01:30:16,331
Yeah, the bedtime story
said butterflies are drawn to the Healer.

1013
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:18,856
But, Mr. Heep,
you brought that butterfly to me.

1014
01:30:19,020 --> 01:30:22,331
It caught my eye as you walked over.

1015
01:30:24,700 --> 01:30:26,054
I did?

1016
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:34,213
Wait, no.

1017
01:30:34,380 --> 01:30:36,099
You must try.

1018
01:30:36,260 --> 01:30:39,333
-There's no time.
-I can't. I can't. I can't.

1019
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:41,014
Shut up. . .

1020
01:30:41,980 --> 01:30:43,460
. . .and try.

1021
01:31:22,940 --> 01:31:26,058
Say something to bring out your energy.

1022
01:31:29,900 --> 01:31:32,779
I'm sorry I couldn't protect you.

1023
01:31:38,500 --> 01:31:40,253
I should have been there.

1024
01:31:40,420 --> 01:31:42,651
I am always gonna regret. . .

1025
01:31:44,700 --> 01:31:47,090
. . .just not being there.

1026
01:31:52,540 --> 01:31:54,930
I'll miss your faces.

1027
01:31:57,660 --> 01:32:00,221
Oh, they remind me of God.

1028
01:32:06,140 --> 01:32:08,939
I'm so lost without you guys.

1029
01:32:14,300 --> 01:32:19,614
I met this very nice lady,
and her name's Story.

1030
01:32:20,900 --> 01:32:23,210
And I think you would've liked her.

1031
01:32:25,980 --> 01:32:28,097
I think she might be. . .

1032
01:32:29,780 --> 01:32:31,692
. . .an angel. . .

1033
01:32:33,820 --> 01:32:36,381
. . .because she has to go home.

1034
01:32:41,060 --> 01:32:43,131
I love you all.

1035
01:32:44,620 --> 01:32:47,181
I love you all so much.

1036
01:33:31,100 --> 01:33:34,093
Thank you for all you have done.

1037
01:33:45,100 --> 01:33:48,298
Your sister will have seven children.

1038
01:33:48,460 --> 01:33:50,577
You will see the first two.

1039
01:36:00,540 --> 01:36:04,250
Oh, my God. He's the Guardian.

1040
01:36:04,780 --> 01:36:05,975
Reggie!

1041
01:36:06,140 --> 01:36:08,336
Reggie! Reggie,
just keep looking in his eyes!

1042
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:10,810
Keep looking in his eyes!

1043
01:37:52,660 --> 01:37:55,255
Thank you for saving my life.
