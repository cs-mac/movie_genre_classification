1
00:00:13,207 --> 00:00:17,962
'Twas the night before Christmas,
and all through the house,

2
00:00:18,047 --> 00:00:23,360
not a creature was stirring,
not even a mouse.

3
00:02:00,447 --> 00:02:02,802
Goddamn, Day-Day.

4
00:02:04,287 --> 00:02:08,360
Take it all.
One, two, get up, three.

5
00:02:08,447 --> 00:02:11,200
That's what I'm talkin' about.

6
00:02:22,167 --> 00:02:26,558
Damn! That's an ugly-ass baby.
Eyes cocked like a pistol.

7
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:30,845
All I want, Santa Claus,
is two fat bitches and a bag of weed

8
00:02:30,927 --> 00:02:34,124
and two bags of chips
to give to the fat bitches.

9
00:02:35,727 --> 00:02:36,842
What the...

10
00:02:36,927 --> 00:02:38,838
Damn, these niggas are broke.

11
00:02:38,927 --> 00:02:42,636
No Christmas ham in here. Nothing.

12
00:02:42,727 --> 00:02:44,399
lt's a damn shame.

13
00:02:44,487 --> 00:02:46,796
All l want is two fat bitches
and some cheeseburgers

14
00:02:46,887 --> 00:02:48,605
so Cheeco can lick on them

15
00:02:48,687 --> 00:02:50,723
and two years' supply
of rolling paper.

16
00:02:50,807 --> 00:02:53,321
Two pieces of bologna. Yeah, baby.

17
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:56,604
This gonna be good right here.
I'm so hungry.

18
00:02:58,247 --> 00:03:00,044
What the hell
you doin' in my house

19
00:03:00,127 --> 00:03:01,765
eatin' a big-ass sandwich and shit?

20
00:03:01,847 --> 00:03:04,156
Nigga, I'm Santa Claus.
Where's the milk and cookies?

21
00:03:04,247 --> 00:03:05,760
Santa Claus!

22
00:03:05,847 --> 00:03:06,996
Shit!

23
00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:09,237
You better get your ass outta here!

24
00:03:09,327 --> 00:03:10,396
Goddamn!

25
00:03:10,487 --> 00:03:12,079
Day-Day! Day-Day!

26
00:03:29,767 --> 00:03:33,123
All I want is a fat bitch with
a name belt that say ''Glitter'' on it.

27
00:03:37,247 --> 00:03:39,397
Day-Day! Help me, man!

28
00:03:48,927 --> 00:03:50,599
Merry Christmas, motherfucker!

29
00:04:02,887 --> 00:04:04,286
As you can see.

30
00:04:04,367 --> 00:04:06,801
I got my black ass
back in the ghetto.

31
00:04:06,887 --> 00:04:09,162
the only place
where you can get robbed

32
00:04:09,247 --> 00:04:11,317
by Santa Claus
on Chistmas Eve.

33
00:04:11,407 --> 00:04:12,476
Shit!

34
00:04:12,567 --> 00:04:15,764
I don't know if I can handle
another goddamn Friday.

35
00:04:15,847 --> 00:04:17,166
This shit hurt.

36
00:04:18,247 --> 00:04:21,239
Day-Day! Wake up, man!
We just got robbed!

37
00:04:22,247 --> 00:04:24,636
Get your scary ass up, man!
I know you heard that shit!

38
00:04:25,967 --> 00:04:27,161
Get out of here, man!

39
00:04:27,927 --> 00:04:29,724
Wake your ass up!

40
00:04:29,807 --> 00:04:31,559
Come on, man,
I gotta call the po-po!

41
00:04:33,447 --> 00:04:36,245
What you say? Damn.

42
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,646
We just got robbed, Cheeco.

43
00:07:42,247 --> 00:07:46,160
Unit 415. man
in the middle of the street.

44
00:07:46,247 --> 00:07:48,158
Then what happened?

45
00:07:48,247 --> 00:07:51,159
Then I caught him.
I hit him, like, four times.

46
00:07:51,247 --> 00:07:54,125
I would've been a boxer,
but I was in Special Education.

47
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:56,482
I'm telling you,
I was whooping his ass!

48
00:07:56,567 --> 00:07:58,478
Craig got to fightin' with him,
he beat his ass.

49
00:07:58,567 --> 00:08:00,159
- Go check out the bedrooms.
- Sure.

50
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:01,885
What else did he get?

51
00:08:02,767 --> 00:08:05,327
Like I said,
he took all of our presents,

52
00:08:05,407 --> 00:08:07,318
he took my CD collection,

53
00:08:07,407 --> 00:08:10,604
he even took
Day-Day's baby pictures.

54
00:08:10,687 --> 00:08:13,645
And he got our speaker
with all our rent money in it.

55
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:14,716
Rent money!

56
00:08:16,527 --> 00:08:18,358
- Sit your ass down!
- Who got the rent money?!

57
00:08:18,447 --> 00:08:21,086
You ain't about to do nothin'.

58
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,646
Jumpin' up like you Mr. Get Bad.

59
00:08:22,727 --> 00:08:25,195
Where was you when he was
beatin' my ass with that tree?

60
00:08:25,287 --> 00:08:27,847
- Craig, my leg is hurtin', man.
- Good!

61
00:08:27,927 --> 00:08:30,839
Yeah, he got
the rent money. All of it.

62
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,361
You're positive he was dressed
like Santa Claus?

63
00:08:33,447 --> 00:08:35,563
Jolly white fat guy,
little red suit,

64
00:08:35,647 --> 00:08:38,366
couple elves packin' the bags.

65
00:08:38,447 --> 00:08:39,926
He's a project Santa Claus.

66
00:08:40,007 --> 00:08:42,567
Picture Ol' Dirty Bastard
in a Santa Claus suit.

67
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,160
Can you picture that?

68
00:08:44,247 --> 00:08:46,807
Do you know who
Ol' Dirty Bastard is?

69
00:08:46,887 --> 00:08:48,764
I'm not big on that.

70
00:08:48,847 --> 00:08:50,724
You oughta be nervous.
You a black cop.

71
00:08:50,807 --> 00:08:53,367
You two motherfuckers huddle up
or something and find this dude.

72
00:08:53,447 --> 00:08:54,926
Stay right there.

73
00:08:55,367 --> 00:08:56,436
I ain't goin' nowhere.

74
00:08:56,527 --> 00:08:58,040
- Calm down.
- I'm calm.

75
00:08:58,127 --> 00:09:00,118
- You're gonna sit in the car.
- Do your fucking job!

76
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:01,606
You're pushing the wrong buttons.

77
00:09:01,687 --> 00:09:03,439
We the victims, man.

78
00:09:03,527 --> 00:09:06,485
That victim shit is way overblown.

79
00:09:06,567 --> 00:09:08,603
Just sit there and shut up.

80
00:09:08,687 --> 00:09:10,086
Asshole.

81
00:09:10,167 --> 00:09:12,078
Santa Claus strikes again.

82
00:09:12,167 --> 00:09:14,442
Makes me want to go home
and lock up all my shit.

83
00:09:14,527 --> 00:09:16,483
You gotta stop talking
to the police like that.

84
00:09:16,567 --> 00:09:18,523
Shut up! You better stop
talking to me like that.

85
00:09:18,607 --> 00:09:20,962
I could kick your ass
for the way you actin' this morning.

86
00:09:21,047 --> 00:09:22,526
We gonna have our Christmas party?

87
00:09:22,607 --> 00:09:25,883
How we gonna have a party
with our apartment looking like this?

88
00:09:25,967 --> 00:09:29,004
We can't cancel the party, man!
What about the hos we had coming?

89
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,679
I invited some nice-ass girls.

90
00:09:30,767 --> 00:09:31,995
They gonna fuck for a buck,

91
00:09:32,087 --> 00:09:33,918
do something strange
for a little piece of change,

92
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:36,362
and I know we gonna
make them holler for a dollar.

93
00:09:36,447 --> 00:09:38,438
One said they was gonna
suck my dick from the back.

94
00:09:38,527 --> 00:09:40,722
I ain't never had that
ever happen to me.

95
00:09:40,807 --> 00:09:45,756
I'm trying to go see
what that be like right there--

96
00:09:45,847 --> 00:09:48,805
Look, man, I don't give
a shit about you, that party.

97
00:09:48,887 --> 00:09:50,320
All I got to worry about is the rent,

98
00:09:50,407 --> 00:09:53,080
and it was your idea
to use half the rent money...

99
00:09:56,127 --> 00:09:57,879
Dix, I think we got something here.

100
00:09:57,967 --> 00:10:00,003
Well, well. Whose is this?

101
00:10:00,087 --> 00:10:02,203
Actually, it's both of ours.

102
00:10:02,287 --> 00:10:03,276
No, it ain't!

103
00:10:04,207 --> 00:10:07,005
lt is, but it's for
medicinal uses only.

104
00:10:07,087 --> 00:10:09,806
I mean, he got cataract,
lazy eye, a little glaucoma.

105
00:10:09,887 --> 00:10:13,004
- See that eye right there?
- Little shot of gonorrhea, see?

106
00:10:13,087 --> 00:10:15,555
Do you guys have any idea
what we could do to you for this?

107
00:10:15,647 --> 00:10:17,922
- No.
- Juvenile center?

108
00:10:18,007 --> 00:10:20,805
We can make your Christmas
worse than it already is.

109
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:21,956
Being that it's Friday,

110
00:10:22,047 --> 00:10:24,641
that means you're not gonna
see a judge till possibly Monday.

111
00:10:24,727 --> 00:10:25,762
Maybe.

112
00:10:25,847 --> 00:10:29,237
But, since we're nice guys,
we'll just confiscate this plant,

113
00:10:29,327 --> 00:10:31,795
take it with us until we find
this Santa Claus character.

114
00:10:31,887 --> 00:10:33,798
That's fucked up, too.

115
00:10:33,887 --> 00:10:36,276
Oh, hey,
and when we find St. Nick,

116
00:10:36,367 --> 00:10:38,927
what do y'all want us
to do to him, you know?

117
00:10:39,007 --> 00:10:42,477
Cracked ribs, fractured skull,
little eye gouge?

118
00:10:42,567 --> 00:10:45,001
Fractured skull,
beat the shit out that motherfucker.

119
00:10:45,087 --> 00:10:47,999
- Eye gouge, that's the shit.
- And an eye gouge.

120
00:10:48,087 --> 00:10:50,920
I say stick a plunger in his ass,
like they did in New York.

121
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,998
Fractured skull.

122
00:10:53,087 --> 00:10:56,557
This is Officer Brian Dix.
I'm Officer Alvin Hole.

123
00:10:56,647 --> 00:10:58,319
We'll let you know
if anything develops.

124
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:01,399
Officer A. Hole and B. Dix.

125
00:11:01,487 --> 00:11:02,806
We'll call you...

126
00:11:02,887 --> 00:11:05,037
if we find anything.

127
00:11:06,087 --> 00:11:07,998
I like them police right there.

128
00:11:10,287 --> 00:11:13,597
You got a big pile of dog shit
in the middle of your bed.

129
00:11:13,687 --> 00:11:16,042
You might want to check that out.

130
00:11:16,127 --> 00:11:17,480
Merry Christmas.

131
00:11:19,247 --> 00:11:20,760
He's the dick.

132
00:11:21,007 --> 00:11:22,645
What the hell
is going on around here?!

133
00:11:22,727 --> 00:11:24,160
Happy Holidays, Miss Pearly.

134
00:11:24,247 --> 00:11:28,286
Police running in and out!
What the hell is going on?

135
00:11:28,367 --> 00:11:31,200
Somebody broke in
and stole all our stuff.

136
00:11:31,287 --> 00:11:32,640
That bullshit security.

137
00:11:32,727 --> 00:11:35,161
I sure hope they
didn't get the rent money

138
00:11:35,247 --> 00:11:37,715
'cause you two niggas
been ducking and dodging me

139
00:11:37,807 --> 00:11:38,922
for about three weeks now.

140
00:11:39,007 --> 00:11:39,996
Me--

141
00:11:40,087 --> 00:11:44,444
Today is the day
you motherfuckers is gonna kick in!

142
00:11:44,527 --> 00:11:47,360
Why you always bring your ass
up here harassing us?

143
00:11:47,447 --> 00:11:48,880
With that big ol' wolf pussy?

144
00:11:48,967 --> 00:11:51,162
You come here all the time
smelling like that.

145
00:11:51,247 --> 00:11:53,807
- You don't even own the place!
- You just the manager.

146
00:11:53,887 --> 00:11:57,163
And I'm gonna manage
to evict your skinny-punk black ass

147
00:11:57,247 --> 00:12:00,637
out of here today if you two
motherfuckers don't pay up your rent.

148
00:12:00,727 --> 00:12:02,843
Man, get that lined up.

149
00:12:02,927 --> 00:12:05,395
Don't you worry about it, bitch.
I know somebody like it.

150
00:12:05,487 --> 00:12:09,082
Take your ass back downstairs,
'cause you ain't evictin' nobody

151
00:12:09,167 --> 00:12:11,203
unless you got
a motherfucking army with you.

152
00:12:11,287 --> 00:12:14,643
I don't need no army, Mr. Smart-Ass!

153
00:12:14,727 --> 00:12:17,036
My son Damon home right now.

154
00:12:17,127 --> 00:12:18,162
Damon!

155
00:12:18,247 --> 00:12:20,886
I had a nightmare
about that fool last night.

156
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,320
Day-Day!

157
00:12:23,407 --> 00:12:24,920
Craig!

158
00:12:26,647 --> 00:12:29,002
Which one of you bitches
want to wash my drawers tonight?

159
00:12:29,087 --> 00:12:30,566
- That'd be him.
- Him.

160
00:12:32,167 --> 00:12:33,395
Okay.

161
00:12:33,487 --> 00:12:36,445
I wash on Sundays, anyway.

162
00:12:36,527 --> 00:12:38,085
Starch or press?

163
00:12:38,167 --> 00:12:39,600
Starch, nigga!

164
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,482
Move!

165
00:12:43,567 --> 00:12:45,398
Come on in, Miss Pearly.

166
00:12:45,487 --> 00:12:47,955
- When did he get out?
- Last night.

167
00:12:48,407 --> 00:12:51,524
And I'm gonna let you two bitches
in on a little secret--

168
00:12:51,607 --> 00:12:55,077
when you spend 12 years
on a level-4 prison yard,

169
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:59,160
you become quite fond
of little ol' girls like yourselves.

170
00:12:59,247 --> 00:13:02,045
So either I'm gonna
get my rent money today,

171
00:13:02,127 --> 00:13:05,244
or somebody getting
their salad tossed tonight!

172
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:06,316
Damn!

173
00:13:06,407 --> 00:13:07,760
That ain't even necessary.

174
00:13:07,847 --> 00:13:08,836
Sure ain't!

175
00:13:08,927 --> 00:13:11,157
We start our new job today,

176
00:13:11,247 --> 00:13:13,636
and I swear to God we're gonna
have your money later on tonight--

177
00:13:13,727 --> 00:13:15,922
cash...in your hand!

178
00:13:16,007 --> 00:13:17,201
You better!

179
00:13:17,287 --> 00:13:22,156
Either you fixin' to come see me,
or Damon gonna come see you.

180
00:13:22,247 --> 00:13:23,919
Simple as that.

181
00:13:24,007 --> 00:13:25,998
You like 'cause your son is a fag?

182
00:13:26,087 --> 00:13:27,839
Shut up, bitch!

183
00:13:30,127 --> 00:13:33,517
Tell your fine daddy I said...

184
00:13:37,967 --> 00:13:39,639
I hate that bitch!

185
00:13:39,727 --> 00:13:42,036
Tight-ass pants, man! Shit!

186
00:13:43,247 --> 00:13:45,556
Look how tight
these motherfucking pants are.

187
00:13:45,647 --> 00:13:48,115
I can't even do
the James Brown in these pants.

188
00:13:48,207 --> 00:13:50,084
Good. I don't want
to see you do the James Brown.

189
00:13:50,167 --> 00:13:52,761
We ain't never gonna get
no pussy in these clothes.

190
00:13:52,847 --> 00:13:54,041
I'm gonna get some.

191
00:13:54,127 --> 00:13:56,004
Tasha, how we look?

192
00:13:56,087 --> 00:13:57,361
Like a couple of rent-a-cops.

193
00:13:57,447 --> 00:13:59,324
What about them rent-a-tits?

194
00:14:00,767 --> 00:14:02,837
See, the clothes don't make the player,

195
00:14:02,927 --> 00:14:04,679
the player make the clothes.

196
00:14:04,767 --> 00:14:06,246
Rent-a-cops get pussy, too.

197
00:14:06,327 --> 00:14:08,158
I'm not no rent-a-cop,
I'm a Top Flight Security

198
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:10,158
and don't you never forget it.

199
00:14:10,247 --> 00:14:12,807
I swear, the first motherfucker
get out of hand...

200
00:14:12,887 --> 00:14:14,878
- I'm gonna beat the--
- Shit!

201
00:14:14,967 --> 00:14:16,525
Craig and Day-Day.

202
00:14:19,247 --> 00:14:21,442
Just the niggas I need to see.

203
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,438
Yo, what's up, O.G., triple O.G.,

204
00:14:23,527 --> 00:14:26,439
O.G. triple, triple...O.G.?

205
00:14:26,527 --> 00:14:27,880
You got out last night?

206
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:30,083
I ain't seen y'all
in about 12 years, nigga.

207
00:14:30,167 --> 00:14:31,805
I was little. I was about--

208
00:14:31,887 --> 00:14:33,036
You're grown up now, though.

209
00:14:34,647 --> 00:14:36,558
Give a nigga a hug, dawg.

210
00:14:38,767 --> 00:14:40,120
I'm about to go--

211
00:14:42,727 --> 00:14:44,922
lt's cool, dawg, it's cool. Come here.

212
00:14:45,487 --> 00:14:46,636
Yeah, right there.

213
00:14:48,007 --> 00:14:50,441
- Group hug, nigga.
- Come on, Craig.

214
00:14:51,607 --> 00:14:52,676
All right, come here.

215
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,997
Get your ass over here.
Talk to you for a minute.

216
00:14:55,087 --> 00:14:56,759
What's up, dawg?

217
00:14:56,847 --> 00:14:58,360
lt's good to be home,

218
00:14:58,447 --> 00:15:01,484
'cause in the prison, dawg,
ain't nothin' but the fellas, nigga.

219
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,762
- That's what I heard.
- I swear, man.

220
00:15:03,847 --> 00:15:06,122
We got to care about each other.

221
00:15:06,207 --> 00:15:07,481
That's right.

222
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,280
Somebody go get my mother!

223
00:15:12,407 --> 00:15:15,558
I heard you motherfuckers
ain't paid your rent this month.

224
00:15:15,647 --> 00:15:17,558
Ducking and dodging
my moms and shit!

225
00:15:18,327 --> 00:15:19,919
Get your tittie off my chin!

226
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,317
Show up here tonight
without that rent money,

227
00:15:23,407 --> 00:15:26,285
and we gonna get
real motherfucking acquainted.

228
00:15:26,367 --> 00:15:27,402
You dig?

229
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:30,797
- I can't breathe, I swear to God!
- He can't breathe!

230
00:15:30,887 --> 00:15:31,922
Do you dig?!

231
00:15:32,007 --> 00:15:33,804
I'm feeling you, dawg. Trust me.

232
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:36,117
- Digging it.
- Good, good.

233
00:15:36,207 --> 00:15:38,437
'Cause I'm gonna
only say this shit once.

234
00:15:39,527 --> 00:15:40,846
Come on, man, let's go.

235
00:15:41,847 --> 00:15:44,520
Y'all look good in your little
tight-ass rent-a-cop outfits.

236
00:15:44,607 --> 00:15:46,802
Merry Christmas, niggettes.

237
00:15:48,207 --> 00:15:50,562
Shit, man! That's bullshit, man.

238
00:15:50,647 --> 00:15:53,366
He's gonna try and do
something strange to us!

239
00:15:53,447 --> 00:15:55,119
I'm gonna think of something.

240
00:15:55,207 --> 00:15:56,560
That's fucked up, man.

241
00:15:56,647 --> 00:15:59,207
He might do something strange
to you, though.

242
00:16:05,807 --> 00:16:07,604
Puff-puff and give, motherfucker.

243
00:16:07,687 --> 00:16:10,360
This is good shit.
I ain't gonna be your mother--

244
00:16:10,447 --> 00:16:12,324
- Damn!
- Hurry up!

245
00:16:23,207 --> 00:16:26,244
About a yean ago.
my Pops quit his dog-catching job

246
00:16:26,327 --> 00:16:29,125
and went into business
with my Uncle Elroy.

247
00:16:29,207 --> 00:16:31,926
They opened up a spot
called Bros. Barb-B-Q.

248
00:16:32,007 --> 00:16:34,840
''Tastes so good.
make you wanna slap youn mama. ''

249
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:36,724
You might've
seen the commencial.

250
00:16:36,807 --> 00:16:39,275
Y'all tired of that barbecue
from up the street.

251
00:16:39,367 --> 00:16:41,119
where they give you
more sauce than meat?

252
00:16:41,207 --> 00:16:43,198
Bning youn big ass down
to Bros. Bar-B-Q.

253
00:16:43,287 --> 00:16:45,881
15837 South Crenshaw Boulevard.

254
00:16:45,967 --> 00:16:47,400
That's right off Manciesten.

255
00:16:47,487 --> 00:16:51,002
Bros. Bar-B-Q. Tastes so good.
make you want to slap youn mama!

256
00:16:51,087 --> 00:16:52,122
Don't it. Willie?

257
00:16:52,207 --> 00:16:54,118
Yeah. boy. Hey. Mama.

258
00:16:54,207 --> 00:16:55,560
What the hell you want?

259
00:16:57,567 --> 00:17:00,240
Ain't but one location.
so it's nearest you.

260
00:17:00,327 --> 00:17:01,726
You might've missed it.

261
00:17:01,807 --> 00:17:04,196
They only had enough money
for a 15-second spot.

262
00:17:04,287 --> 00:17:06,357
But. anyway. my Pops
got me and Day-Day

263
00:17:06,447 --> 00:17:09,120
thesejobs
at the same strip mall

264
00:17:09,207 --> 00:17:10,879
as Christmas-help security.

265
00:17:10,967 --> 00:17:15,119
Look, Day-Day,
we only security guards, okay?

266
00:17:15,207 --> 00:17:17,118
Ghetto security guards at that.

267
00:17:17,207 --> 00:17:19,926
We ain't Cops.
we ain't America's Most Wanted.

268
00:17:20,007 --> 00:17:22,999
NYPD Blue.
none of that shit you watch.

269
00:17:23,087 --> 00:17:24,725
We something like them.

270
00:17:24,807 --> 00:17:26,001
No. Nothing like it.

271
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:29,079
All we gonna do--take it easy,
make this money,

272
00:17:29,167 --> 00:17:30,759
you're gonna watch your temper--

273
00:17:30,847 --> 00:17:31,916
I ain't got to watch shit!

274
00:17:32,007 --> 00:17:34,043
You gonna treat people right,
talk to people right.

275
00:17:34,127 --> 00:17:36,322
You can get your ass kicked
around here real quick.

276
00:17:36,407 --> 00:17:38,204
I don't care about it
getting out of hand.

277
00:17:38,287 --> 00:17:40,278
I ain't getting into shit
because of you.

278
00:17:40,367 --> 00:17:42,961
This is a job, man.
This ain't an adventure.

279
00:17:43,047 --> 00:17:45,800
This is real, and I'm gonna
let you know, I'm not having it.

280
00:17:45,887 --> 00:17:47,525
Everybody's a suspect today.

281
00:17:47,607 --> 00:17:49,120
And I told you, I'm a player.

282
00:17:49,207 --> 00:17:51,118
I don't care about none of that.

283
00:17:52,087 --> 00:17:53,122
Damn!

284
00:17:53,207 --> 00:17:55,323
Get your ass out, player.

285
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,635
Fuck, you remedial!

286
00:17:56,727 --> 00:17:58,524
- What does that mean?
- Retarded!

287
00:17:58,607 --> 00:18:01,121
- That wasn't nothing.
- Dumb-ass, let's go.

288
00:18:01,207 --> 00:18:02,481
I mess up all the time.

289
00:18:08,847 --> 00:18:10,200
Come here! Look!

290
00:18:13,327 --> 00:18:15,204
- That's him!
- Let's get that mother!

291
00:18:21,207 --> 00:18:23,641
Get him! Kick him!

292
00:18:25,207 --> 00:18:27,084
- Craig! Day-Day!
- Uncle Willie!

293
00:18:27,167 --> 00:18:28,520
What the hell you doing to me?

294
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,996
What's happening?

295
00:18:31,087 --> 00:18:32,202
Man, I didn't know!

296
00:18:32,287 --> 00:18:34,642
Pop, I thought
you were somebody else!

297
00:18:34,727 --> 00:18:37,116
Willie, what are you doing
to them boys back there?

298
00:18:37,207 --> 00:18:39,118
Nothing! I'm counting
money at the register.

299
00:18:39,207 --> 00:18:41,243
These fools
knock the hell out of me...

300
00:18:41,327 --> 00:18:44,842
We made a mistake. Day-Day
ran in and jumped on Daddy!

301
00:18:44,927 --> 00:18:46,121
He's lying!

302
00:18:46,207 --> 00:18:48,198
Why you boys
beating up on Santa Claus?

303
00:18:48,287 --> 00:18:50,676
He broke in our house
and stole our presents.

304
00:18:50,767 --> 00:18:53,235
- And Craig let him do it!
- Why, Craig?

305
00:18:53,327 --> 00:18:56,000
- Why blame me?
- 'Cause you did!

306
00:18:56,087 --> 00:18:57,725
I tried to fight him, and Day-Day...

307
00:18:57,807 --> 00:18:59,718
I was screaming,
he wouldn't even help.

308
00:18:59,807 --> 00:19:01,559
What did you do, Day-Day?

309
00:19:01,647 --> 00:19:03,717
Nothing!
He stayed asleep the whole time.

310
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,126
Can I tell my story?

311
00:19:05,207 --> 00:19:08,279
I ain't done shit, but he could have
did something about it!

312
00:19:08,367 --> 00:19:09,925
What did he look like?

313
00:19:10,007 --> 00:19:12,567
Like Bobby Brown
in a goddamned Santa Claus suit!

314
00:19:12,647 --> 00:19:13,841
I heard about him.

315
00:19:13,927 --> 00:19:17,124
They call him
the ''Santa Clause Crook.''

316
00:19:17,207 --> 00:19:19,323
He robbed a lady
in the parking lot last week.

317
00:19:19,407 --> 00:19:21,602
He called her
a ''ho ho ho'' and kept running.

318
00:19:21,687 --> 00:19:23,120
Who the fuck are you?

319
00:19:23,207 --> 00:19:27,837
I'm Cookie, the new waitress,
and, um...

320
00:19:27,927 --> 00:19:30,725
Elroy's new girlfriend.

321
00:19:31,567 --> 00:19:33,922
You got another one?
You're gonna catch something!

322
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:36,680
You should have kept
Sugar's nasty ass. What happened?

323
00:19:36,767 --> 00:19:38,758
I kicked her country ass
to the curb.

324
00:19:38,847 --> 00:19:40,997
Hooked up with her little sister.

325
00:19:41,087 --> 00:19:42,884
That's how we players roll!

326
00:19:42,967 --> 00:19:48,280
Elroy, read my lips--
you ain't no player!

327
00:19:48,367 --> 00:19:50,881
You don't know nothing
about being a player.

328
00:19:50,967 --> 00:19:55,279
Betty done had your ass
pussy-whipped for about 30 years!

329
00:19:55,367 --> 00:19:57,517
Nobody got me pussy-whipped.

330
00:19:57,607 --> 00:20:01,043
l...whips...pussy!

331
00:20:04,727 --> 00:20:08,003
You boys look really good
with your rent-a-cop outfits on.

332
00:20:08,087 --> 00:20:09,440
Yes, very attractive.

333
00:20:09,527 --> 00:20:13,156
This is Top Flight Security.
We ain't no rent-a-cops.

334
00:20:13,247 --> 00:20:14,680
Daddy, how I look?

335
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:18,120
- Like a damn snitch!
- Man, that's cold!

336
00:20:18,207 --> 00:20:20,801
Look like you're ready
to tell on somebody right now!

337
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:23,321
Where's your flashlight at?
You're supposed to have one.

338
00:20:23,407 --> 00:20:25,443
You've got to shine some damn body!

339
00:20:25,527 --> 00:20:28,963
We're supposed to get handcuffs,
flashlights, taser guns--

340
00:20:29,047 --> 00:20:30,196
Two German shepherds.

341
00:20:30,287 --> 00:20:33,757
Y'all must not know what happened
to the last security guards.

342
00:20:35,607 --> 00:20:38,326
Mama's in the kitchen with the sauce.

343
00:20:38,407 --> 00:20:40,125
Aw, shit! The sauce! Move, girl!

344
00:20:40,207 --> 00:20:42,163
What happened
to the other two sec--

345
00:20:42,247 --> 00:20:43,316
Wait a minute!

346
00:20:43,407 --> 00:20:45,125
Go say hello to your grandmother.

347
00:20:45,207 --> 00:20:47,675
Come on, let's go. Move your big ass!

348
00:20:47,767 --> 00:20:50,201
What happened with
the last two security guards?

349
00:20:52,887 --> 00:20:55,117
- Wake up, Mama.
- What the hell you want?

350
00:20:55,207 --> 00:20:57,596
You burned the sauce again.
Give me the spoon.

351
00:20:57,687 --> 00:20:59,120
Nobody's gonna hit you.

352
00:20:59,207 --> 00:21:01,402
You've lost your mind
since Willie slapped you.

353
00:21:01,487 --> 00:21:03,000
Damn, what happened to her?

354
00:21:03,087 --> 00:21:05,647
You should never have let her
into the commercial, anyway.

355
00:21:05,727 --> 00:21:07,126
Got no business working.

356
00:21:07,207 --> 00:21:09,084
You're the one
gave her a concussion, Willie.

357
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:12,079
- You were supposed to be acting.
- I should have smacked you!

358
00:21:12,167 --> 00:21:13,202
How's she doing?

359
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,882
Hey, Big Mama, you all right?

360
00:21:16,967 --> 00:21:19,117
- Who are you?
- lt's Craig, Mama.

361
00:21:19,207 --> 00:21:21,243
- Who Craig?
- Don't worry about it.

362
00:21:21,327 --> 00:21:24,160
Your oldest grandson.
The smart one, not Day-Day.

363
00:21:24,247 --> 00:21:26,636
She's still having blackouts
and blurred vision.

364
00:21:26,727 --> 00:21:28,126
Bet you remember Day-Day!

365
00:21:28,207 --> 00:21:30,277
Why you always
playing with her all the time?

366
00:21:30,367 --> 00:21:32,437
That's enough
damn salt there, Willie.

367
00:21:32,527 --> 00:21:34,165
I know what I'm doing.

368
00:21:34,247 --> 00:21:36,477
Don't nobody want all that salt
in their potato salad!

369
00:21:36,567 --> 00:21:37,761
Y'all argue too much!

370
00:21:37,847 --> 00:21:40,042
What's wrong with y'all?
Y'all should get married.

371
00:21:40,127 --> 00:21:42,721
Why are you in so much
competition with me?

372
00:21:42,807 --> 00:21:44,160
You jealous, Willie.

373
00:21:44,247 --> 00:21:46,807
I can't help it!
I look better than you do!

374
00:21:46,887 --> 00:21:47,922
You don't.

375
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:49,565
- I cook better than you.
- You can't.

376
00:21:49,647 --> 00:21:52,684
- My dick is bigger than yours.
- lt was cold that night.

377
00:21:52,767 --> 00:21:55,839
Think--last year at this time,
you had won the Lotto,

378
00:21:55,927 --> 00:21:57,963
over $1 million.

379
00:21:58,047 --> 00:22:00,880
Anybody else would be living
in the French Riviera.

380
00:22:00,967 --> 00:22:03,162
You're back here
cooking pigs' feet with me

381
00:22:03,247 --> 00:22:05,158
at Bros. B-B-B-Bar-B-Q.

382
00:22:05,247 --> 00:22:07,238
You tied-tongued dog catcher!

383
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:10,125
You best check on the sauce.
Mama's out on her feet again.

384
00:22:10,207 --> 00:22:11,640
Dumb-ass dog catcher.

385
00:22:11,727 --> 00:22:15,083
''I'm a Lotto stud.
Lotto fucking stud.''

386
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,727
So after Pops and Unc argued
for another 15 minutes.

387
00:22:17,807 --> 00:22:19,445
it was time
to meet our new boss.

388
00:22:19,527 --> 00:22:20,596
His name is Moly.

389
00:22:20,687 --> 00:22:23,963
He ran the whole strip mall
and owned Holy Moly Donuts.

390
00:22:24,047 --> 00:22:29,804
But trust me. don't even. even. even.
even. even. even. even eat there.

391
00:22:31,887 --> 00:22:33,764
We'll take the usual, Moly.

392
00:22:36,327 --> 00:22:37,601
How you doing, boy?

393
00:22:37,687 --> 00:22:39,837
Good, buddy.
Merry Christmas, buddy.

394
00:22:39,927 --> 00:22:41,724
Happy Hanukkah. L'claim.

395
00:22:41,807 --> 00:22:43,035
These are my boys.

396
00:22:43,127 --> 00:22:45,118
I'll be with you
in just one minute, buddy.

397
00:22:45,207 --> 00:22:47,198
Take your time.

398
00:22:47,287 --> 00:22:49,118
Just be still.

399
00:22:49,207 --> 00:22:50,799
What's up? How's business?

400
00:22:50,887 --> 00:22:53,526
Everything is wonderful. Yeah, boy!

401
00:22:53,607 --> 00:22:55,325
Have you seen our commercial?

402
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:58,126
Barbecue so good, makes you
want to smack your mama.

403
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:02,045
- What the fu--
- Hey, buddy!

404
00:23:02,127 --> 00:23:03,685
What the fuck wrong with you?

405
00:23:03,767 --> 00:23:05,359
Sorry, buddy. Reaction.

406
00:23:05,527 --> 00:23:08,405
Hey, guys, I hear
someone's looking for a job.

407
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:09,920
I want to ask a question.

408
00:23:10,007 --> 00:23:10,996
l...okay.

409
00:23:11,087 --> 00:23:12,725
When we get our guns?

410
00:23:12,807 --> 00:23:15,321
No guns. You are Top Flight
unarmed security guards.

411
00:23:15,407 --> 00:23:17,841
- What about walkie-talkies?
- And flashlights?

412
00:23:17,927 --> 00:23:21,203
Whoever catch the girl back there
giving head behind the trash can?

413
00:23:21,287 --> 00:23:24,085
I have to come back there
with the flashlight and catch her.

414
00:23:24,167 --> 00:23:27,682
You are supposed to be tough guys.
You don't need gadgets, huh?

415
00:23:27,767 --> 00:23:29,644
All you need is this here.

416
00:23:31,087 --> 00:23:33,078
lf there's any problems,
you just blow. Toot-toot!

417
00:23:33,167 --> 00:23:35,476
These guys are here
all the time. They come running.

418
00:23:35,567 --> 00:23:37,080
Goddamn, Craig!

419
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:39,203
- Can we have more donuts?
- Please.

420
00:23:39,287 --> 00:23:41,517
See? Very quick
response time, huh?

421
00:23:41,607 --> 00:23:43,325
You guys ready for tour of property?

422
00:23:43,407 --> 00:23:46,444
Give me a twister. Make it two.
Hold the flies.

423
00:23:46,527 --> 00:23:48,757
Keep up. Come on.
One-two, one-two, one-two.

424
00:23:48,847 --> 00:23:49,882
Come on.

425
00:23:49,967 --> 00:23:53,642
Since you've been here many times,
I'm gonna make it short and sweet.

426
00:23:53,727 --> 00:23:54,955
Buddy, come on.

427
00:23:55,047 --> 00:23:57,242
As you know, this here is my place.

428
00:23:57,327 --> 00:23:59,557
This is
the Holy Moly Donut Shop, huh?

429
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:02,559
Say it with me, guys--
''Holy Moly Donut Shop.''

430
00:24:05,327 --> 00:24:08,285
Very good. You get one
free bear claw every lunch break.

431
00:24:11,207 --> 00:24:12,845
- Come on, guys.
- Come on, come on.

432
00:24:12,927 --> 00:24:17,045
Okay.
Over here is the Chrome Dome.

433
00:24:17,127 --> 00:24:18,924
You got cars, they got rims.

434
00:24:19,007 --> 00:24:21,965
This, of course, is your
family business, Bros. Bar-B-Q.

435
00:24:22,047 --> 00:24:24,163
That's check cashing.
No l.D. required.

436
00:24:24,247 --> 00:24:26,886
This one here
is a brand-new store.

437
00:24:26,967 --> 00:24:30,676
lt's Pimps and Hos--
some kind of flashy clothing.

438
00:24:30,767 --> 00:24:32,359
- Damn!
- Damn!

439
00:24:32,447 --> 00:24:34,039
Who is that?

440
00:24:34,127 --> 00:24:37,005
That's Donna.
She's the owner's girlfriend.

441
00:24:37,087 --> 00:24:40,363
He's a funny-dressing kind of guy
from out of town or something.

442
00:24:41,607 --> 00:24:45,156
He's kind of a pig, though.
He treat her like shit, man.

443
00:24:45,247 --> 00:24:47,317
I would love for her
to be one of my wives, huh?

444
00:24:47,407 --> 00:24:49,045
Damn, how many wives you got?

445
00:24:49,127 --> 00:24:51,083
Me? 12, buddy.

446
00:24:51,167 --> 00:24:53,158
Yeah. All of them freaks, too, huh?

447
00:24:53,247 --> 00:24:55,602
# Freaks come out at night,
what, what, what? #

448
00:24:55,687 --> 00:24:57,166
# Freaks come out at night... #

449
00:24:57,247 --> 00:24:58,566
Whodini. You know Who--

450
00:24:58,647 --> 00:25:00,399
Yeah, buddy! Okay!

451
00:25:00,487 --> 00:25:03,957
He's a character. Real big character.

452
00:25:04,047 --> 00:25:05,765
He's short but big.

453
00:25:06,767 --> 00:25:11,204
# Hold up, wait a minute,
let me put some pimping in it #

454
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:17,124
He's funny-looking, huh?

455
00:25:17,207 --> 00:25:20,005
I don't know. Why he dress like this?

456
00:25:20,087 --> 00:25:23,045
How are you? Doesn't matter.
Get the trunk.

457
00:25:23,127 --> 00:25:24,116
Thank you.

458
00:25:24,207 --> 00:25:25,481
He's got problems.

459
00:25:25,567 --> 00:25:28,320
Quickly, now, quickly.
Got a business to run.

460
00:25:28,407 --> 00:25:30,557
Hey, buddy.

461
00:25:32,047 --> 00:25:33,480
And don't drag that coat.

462
00:25:33,567 --> 00:25:36,081
lt costs more than you do.

463
00:25:37,087 --> 00:25:39,965
Okay, and over here,
this is a liquor store.

464
00:25:40,047 --> 00:25:42,959
Don't let nobody hang out
in front of liquor store.

465
00:25:43,047 --> 00:25:44,036
Nobody, buddy.

466
00:25:44,127 --> 00:25:45,276
Nobody.

467
00:25:45,367 --> 00:25:48,359
And this is your booth.

468
00:25:48,447 --> 00:25:49,482
Any questions?

469
00:25:49,567 --> 00:25:51,876
- l've got one question.
- What's up, buddy?

470
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,720
What happened to the last guards
that worked here?

471
00:25:54,807 --> 00:25:58,516
You ask too many questions, man.
lt's time to get to work.

472
00:25:58,607 --> 00:26:01,485
Remember, you guys are
Top Flight security guards,

473
00:26:01,567 --> 00:26:03,398
best in the whole world, huh?

474
00:26:03,487 --> 00:26:06,206
You have to defend this whole place
with your own life.

475
00:26:06,287 --> 00:26:07,959
And I'll die for this shit, too.

476
00:26:08,047 --> 00:26:11,164
Remember, Christmas Eve
means lots of shoppers.

477
00:26:11,247 --> 00:26:13,636
lf there's any trouble,
you come get me--

478
00:26:13,727 --> 00:26:15,922
when you take care of it,
then come get me.

479
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:17,804
Okay, go, go. Come on.

480
00:26:17,887 --> 00:26:20,276
Come on. Keep it real, huh?

481
00:26:20,367 --> 00:26:22,961
When are you gonna ask him
for an advancement

482
00:26:23,047 --> 00:26:24,480
on our first week's pay?

483
00:26:24,567 --> 00:26:27,127
Don't worry about that.
I'll ask when the time is right.

484
00:26:27,207 --> 00:26:28,845
Just keep your rabbit-ass mouth shut.

485
00:26:28,927 --> 00:26:31,680
- Remember what Damon said.
- You remember what I said.

486
00:26:31,767 --> 00:26:36,079
Don't start trying to outthink me,
because you're gonna hurt yourself.

487
00:26:37,567 --> 00:26:39,046
Where you think you going?

488
00:26:39,127 --> 00:26:41,687
- lt's small in here.
- No, you're big in here.

489
00:26:43,647 --> 00:26:45,603
Get off my foot!

490
00:26:46,287 --> 00:26:49,199
- Just scoot over there.
- You scoot over, man!

491
00:26:52,967 --> 00:26:56,164
This shit is uncomfortable, man.
Can't even move in here.

492
00:26:56,247 --> 00:26:58,841
So what? Just deal with it. I got to.

493
00:27:00,047 --> 00:27:01,446
What are we gonna do now?

494
00:27:01,527 --> 00:27:03,757
Sit here and wait
for something to happen.

495
00:27:05,247 --> 00:27:06,999
Not me.

496
00:27:07,087 --> 00:27:08,679
That shit is boring, man.

497
00:27:08,767 --> 00:27:11,281
Good. I like boring.
Easy money for us.

498
00:27:11,367 --> 00:27:13,676
I hope
don't nothing happen all day.

499
00:27:13,767 --> 00:27:16,327
We can sit and watch these females
shop till they drop.

500
00:27:16,407 --> 00:27:18,443
Matter of fact, watch out.

501
00:27:20,567 --> 00:27:23,035
Ain't this a bitch?
I'm waiting on some action to jump off.

502
00:27:23,127 --> 00:27:24,719
You heard what Mr. Moly said.

503
00:27:24,807 --> 00:27:27,367
We Top Flight
security of the world, Craig!

504
00:27:27,447 --> 00:27:30,041
Shit! Not just the city, the world!

505
00:27:30,127 --> 00:27:33,039
Been jacked by Santa Claus,
all kind of shit.

506
00:27:33,127 --> 00:27:35,163
They need security
in the world, Craig!

507
00:27:35,247 --> 00:27:36,316
Shit!

508
00:27:36,407 --> 00:27:39,126
For one thing, calm down.
Slow your roll.

509
00:27:40,127 --> 00:27:43,597
Don't let that man pump you up
and get your ass shot out here.

510
00:27:43,687 --> 00:27:46,679
We ain't no damn
Top Flight security of the world!

511
00:27:46,767 --> 00:27:49,600
We Craig and Day-Day,
so just kick back, relax--

512
00:27:49,687 --> 00:27:51,996
You heard what happened
to the last security guards.

513
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,317
You didn't even hear what happened,

514
00:27:54,407 --> 00:27:56,602
so how the fuck was I gonna hear it?

515
00:27:56,687 --> 00:27:58,882
Just do your job,
and I'm gonna do mine.

516
00:28:00,367 --> 00:28:02,562
- Shit.
- No problem.

517
00:28:02,647 --> 00:28:05,036
- I'm gonna do my job.
- No problem.

518
00:28:05,127 --> 00:28:07,118
Get your damn feet
out of my f--

519
00:28:10,927 --> 00:28:15,045
# Joy to the world,
the Lord is come #

520
00:28:15,127 --> 00:28:17,687
Bingo! I got action.

521
00:28:19,487 --> 00:28:21,364
What's up?

522
00:28:21,447 --> 00:28:24,598
# Let every heart
prepare him room #

523
00:28:24,687 --> 00:28:26,996
# And heaven and nature sing... #

524
00:28:33,647 --> 00:28:36,036
Heaven and--
fuck all that shit!

525
00:28:36,207 --> 00:28:39,643
Y'all hos got to get off
this corner with that!

526
00:28:39,727 --> 00:28:41,319
Excuse me, sugar,
what did you just say?

527
00:28:41,407 --> 00:28:44,080
You heard me what I said.
Y'all hos got to move off this corner.

528
00:28:44,167 --> 00:28:46,237
You better watch
your little filthy mouth.

529
00:28:46,327 --> 00:28:48,443
You are talking
to children of the Lord.

530
00:28:48,527 --> 00:28:49,596
That's right!

531
00:28:49,687 --> 00:28:52,076
I want you to know
who you're talking to, too--

532
00:28:52,167 --> 00:28:54,556
Top Flight
motherfucking security!

533
00:28:54,647 --> 00:28:57,559
You can't talk to these
old-ass ladies like that!

534
00:28:57,647 --> 00:28:59,478
Just back me up
and do your damn job!

535
00:28:59,567 --> 00:29:01,523
Y'all movin' on
and take that shit--

536
00:29:01,607 --> 00:29:04,326
Wait a minute, bitch!
I ain't no killer, you understand me?

537
00:29:04,407 --> 00:29:06,079
But don't you push me,
don't you touch me!

538
00:29:06,167 --> 00:29:09,364
You gonna make me blow this.
I'll clear all this shit out with this.

539
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:11,756
Joker, fuck you and your whistle!

540
00:29:11,847 --> 00:29:15,123
Y'all trying to use the Lord
to sell pussy on this corner.

541
00:29:15,207 --> 00:29:17,084
Shut your little filthy mouth!

542
00:29:18,887 --> 00:29:20,400
Calm down.

543
00:29:20,487 --> 00:29:23,479
Let's go on to church, and we
gonna pray for these niggas.

544
00:29:23,567 --> 00:29:26,001
Have mercy, Jesus.
Forgive me, Lord.

545
00:29:26,087 --> 00:29:27,566
What's wrong with you?

546
00:29:27,647 --> 00:29:30,525
You can't talk to people like that.
That's somebody grandmama, fool!

547
00:29:30,607 --> 00:29:32,996
I can talk to people
any fucking way I want to,

548
00:29:33,087 --> 00:29:34,884
and I'm the law around here.

549
00:29:34,967 --> 00:29:37,356
And I'm gonna write your ass up
for insubordination.

550
00:29:37,447 --> 00:29:39,642
Let me do my job and you do yours.

551
00:29:39,727 --> 00:29:40,955
Top Flight!

552
00:29:41,047 --> 00:29:44,005
Man. I couldn't believe
how Day-Day was acting.

553
00:29:44,087 --> 00:29:46,237
Even since he got
that whistle around his neck.

554
00:29:46,327 --> 00:29:49,000
He been acting like
a neal asshole rent-a-cop.

555
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:51,123
Look at him!

556
00:29:51,207 --> 00:29:52,640
Where you going?

557
00:29:52,727 --> 00:29:55,002
I'm trying to park so I can go
in the check-cashing place.

558
00:29:55,207 --> 00:29:58,165
You can't park right here
because there's a new policy.

559
00:29:58,247 --> 00:30:00,078
Give me the number,
or you can't park here.

560
00:30:00,167 --> 00:30:01,964
I ain't never heard
of no policy like that.

561
00:30:02,047 --> 00:30:05,403
You ain't never met a Top Flight
security nigga like me!

562
00:30:05,487 --> 00:30:07,842
Give me the number
or get to fucking rolling.

563
00:30:07,927 --> 00:30:11,363
Look at that fool.
I've got to put a stop to this shit.

564
00:30:11,447 --> 00:30:13,483
...no parking spot, okay,
'cause I'm married!

565
00:30:13,567 --> 00:30:16,718
- Get this piece of shit out of here!
- He's just playing.

566
00:30:16,807 --> 00:30:18,798
No, I'm not playing.
You better not park!

567
00:30:18,887 --> 00:30:20,525
- Bye-bye.
- Bring that car back here!

568
00:30:20,607 --> 00:30:23,075
Man, what did I do?

569
00:30:23,167 --> 00:30:24,361
I got this.

570
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:26,756
Why every time you get
a little position of power,

571
00:30:26,847 --> 00:30:28,166
you abuse your authority?

572
00:30:28,247 --> 00:30:30,078
You need to work
on your people skills.

573
00:30:30,167 --> 00:30:33,159
That's bullshit. My people skills
are way better than yours.

574
00:30:33,247 --> 00:30:35,442
Just sit down and relax.

575
00:30:39,207 --> 00:30:41,357
Bingo! Got more action!

576
00:30:46,087 --> 00:30:48,123
Get y'all little bad-ass mo'
over here!

577
00:30:48,207 --> 00:30:50,721
Leave them damn kids alone!
They ain't messing with you!

578
00:30:53,687 --> 00:30:56,759
Stop blowing that goddamn whistle!

579
00:30:56,847 --> 00:30:58,758
What's wrong with you? You tripping!

580
00:30:58,847 --> 00:31:00,917
Some L.A.P.D. shit.

581
00:31:01,007 --> 00:31:03,601
You know what?
Don't hate...appreciate.

582
00:31:03,687 --> 00:31:05,803
You're just mad
'cause I'm always on the...

583
00:31:07,207 --> 00:31:08,481
...crime whistle!

584
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:10,478
I'll calm your ass down
one way or another.

585
00:31:10,567 --> 00:31:13,001
- You ain't got to calm me down.
- Fire that up.

586
00:31:13,087 --> 00:31:15,999
Not on duty. Not on duty!

587
00:31:16,087 --> 00:31:17,600
You better fire this up!

588
00:31:17,687 --> 00:31:21,043
I ain't no grocery-store bouncer.
I'm a Top Flight security guard.

589
00:31:21,127 --> 00:31:23,766
You got to recognize
the difference between the police--

590
00:31:23,847 --> 00:31:26,964
- Light the shit.
- We are not little no more.

591
00:31:27,047 --> 00:31:29,163
- Come on!
- What?

592
00:31:32,927 --> 00:31:34,155
You know what?

593
00:31:34,247 --> 00:31:36,841
You're not gonna be punking me
when we get 40.

594
00:31:36,927 --> 00:31:39,646
This shit gonna stop one day, dude.

595
00:31:39,727 --> 00:31:43,083
Well, it ain't
gonna stop today, so light it up

596
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:44,759
before I beat that ass.

597
00:31:44,847 --> 00:31:47,042
- Whatever.
- Yeah, yeah.

598
00:31:47,127 --> 00:31:49,163
This Barney Fife shit.

599
00:31:54,367 --> 00:31:56,562
I'm thinking of something right now.

600
00:31:56,647 --> 00:31:58,285
That's some good shit, right?

601
00:31:58,367 --> 00:32:01,200
no. You're a bad-ass influence
on my life.

602
00:32:01,287 --> 00:32:03,118
Ever since
l've been kicking it with you,

603
00:32:03,207 --> 00:32:05,163
my life
has been a shambles, dude.

604
00:32:06,167 --> 00:32:08,044
Give me my goddamn joint.

605
00:32:08,127 --> 00:32:09,958
Hold on.
Let me hit it one more time.

606
00:32:10,047 --> 00:32:12,242
One more time,
let me hit it, man!

607
00:32:12,327 --> 00:32:13,760
You gave it to me to smoke!

608
00:32:13,847 --> 00:32:16,998
I ain't no bad influence on you.
I'm the best cousin you've got.

609
00:32:17,087 --> 00:32:20,079
lf it wasn't for me, you'd be
getting punked all the time.

610
00:32:20,167 --> 00:32:23,079
And I keep you safe
and I keep you warm,

611
00:32:23,167 --> 00:32:24,805
'cause you know
how little timid you are.

612
00:32:24,887 --> 00:32:26,206
Look. Look.

613
00:32:28,167 --> 00:32:29,156
Whatever.

614
00:32:31,167 --> 00:32:33,158
Man, it's just us,
Craig and Day-Day. Damn!

615
00:32:35,247 --> 00:32:37,442
I was about to Barry Bonds
y'all's black asses!

616
00:32:37,527 --> 00:32:39,324
You almost made me
catch a heart attack!

617
00:32:39,487 --> 00:32:42,240
I ought to hit your ass
and give you brain damage.

618
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:45,000
Let me hit that before Willie
bring his old square ass out here.

619
00:32:45,087 --> 00:32:47,999
You can go to jail
for some shit like that, for real.

620
00:32:48,087 --> 00:32:49,964
He been real brand-new today.

621
00:32:50,047 --> 00:32:51,446
How's it going out here so far?

622
00:32:51,527 --> 00:32:53,199
lt's been boring and quiet.

623
00:32:53,287 --> 00:32:54,561
Just wait around.

624
00:32:54,647 --> 00:32:57,036
Them young thugs don't come out
till about 1 :00 or 1 :30.

625
00:32:57,127 --> 00:33:00,039
They coming. I just pray to God
I'm here when they come.

626
00:33:00,127 --> 00:33:03,517
Uncle Elroy gonna beat
the shit out of 'em!

627
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:05,040
Ho ho ho, motherfuckers!

628
00:33:05,127 --> 00:33:07,516
What you looking at
before I shoot you in your mouth?

629
00:33:07,607 --> 00:33:09,518
Up against the wall!

630
00:33:09,607 --> 00:33:11,006
Jesus!

631
00:33:11,087 --> 00:33:13,362
Shut up! What you got, toothpick?

632
00:33:13,447 --> 00:33:15,324
I ain't got nothing.

633
00:33:15,407 --> 00:33:18,319
Done shit on yourself!
What you looking at?

634
00:33:18,407 --> 00:33:19,635
Don't I know you?

635
00:33:19,727 --> 00:33:22,366
You gonna know a bullet in your ass!
This all you got?

636
00:33:22,447 --> 00:33:24,324
I ain't got nothing
but 20 funky-ass dollars.

637
00:33:24,407 --> 00:33:26,682
I ought to shoot your broke ass.

638
00:33:26,767 --> 00:33:28,041
What's up, Al Green?

639
00:33:28,127 --> 00:33:31,437
You remind me of them old players
that be clubbing with young girls.

640
00:33:31,527 --> 00:33:35,406
You remind me of a young nigga
fucking with the wrong old nigga!

641
00:33:35,487 --> 00:33:38,126
He's gonna shoot your ass!
Get up against the wall!

642
00:33:38,207 --> 00:33:40,641
Shut up! Give me the watch!

643
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,046
No, not the Rolie.

644
00:33:42,127 --> 00:33:45,119
Now it's a ''stoley.''
Looking like a Mississippi pimp.

645
00:33:45,207 --> 00:33:48,040
Bitch better have my
sweet potatoes. Top Flight Security!

646
00:33:48,127 --> 00:33:50,243
Merry Christmas, motherfuckers.

647
00:33:50,327 --> 00:33:52,045
Santa Claus got my Rolex!
Let's get him!

648
00:33:52,127 --> 00:33:54,118
Do something! Do something!

649
00:33:54,967 --> 00:33:58,482
- Don't just stand there. Help me.
- Shit! How?

650
00:33:59,527 --> 00:34:01,483
Move, move, move!

651
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:05,396
...three quarters,
two dimes, and a nickel!

652
00:34:09,687 --> 00:34:11,837
Y'all didn't hear me
blowing this whistle?

653
00:34:11,927 --> 00:34:12,996
What is it, buddy?

654
00:34:13,087 --> 00:34:16,636
We just got jacked by Santa Claus!
He almost tied us up and fucked us!

655
00:34:16,727 --> 00:34:18,877
- He pulled out a pistol...
- Dodo, you on crack, buddy?

656
00:34:30,887 --> 00:34:34,436
- Hey, man, just let it go.
- Get your goddamn hands off me!

657
00:34:34,527 --> 00:34:37,963
Me, my cousin, and my daddy--
we just got jacked by Santa Claus!

658
00:34:38,047 --> 00:34:39,639
But you're security guard, buddy.

659
00:34:39,727 --> 00:34:42,446
That's why I asked your ass
for them two flashlights.

660
00:34:44,447 --> 00:34:45,675
These guys!

661
00:34:45,767 --> 00:34:47,359
That's why I hate the fuckin' law!

662
00:34:47,447 --> 00:34:49,119
Get your fat ass up and do something!

663
00:34:49,207 --> 00:34:51,038
You get up, too!

664
00:34:51,127 --> 00:34:54,164
Give me flashlights,
or we gonna get killed around here!

665
00:34:54,247 --> 00:34:56,238
Jacked by Santa Claus
on Christmas Eve!

666
00:34:56,327 --> 00:34:58,716
Twice in one day!

667
00:34:58,807 --> 00:35:02,038
You wanted to grab somebody,
you should've grabbed that nigga!

668
00:35:02,127 --> 00:35:05,119
Security! You need to
turn in your damn whistle!

669
00:35:15,327 --> 00:35:16,965
Where you going, Mama?

670
00:35:17,047 --> 00:35:18,844
I'm going to make my daily rounds.

671
00:35:18,927 --> 00:35:21,043
Could you make me a sandwich
when you get back?

672
00:35:21,127 --> 00:35:23,038
Make your own damn sandwich.

673
00:35:32,567 --> 00:35:35,525
Tupac. Tupac, Tupac!

674
00:35:35,607 --> 00:35:38,121
Goddamn, you fine!

675
00:35:40,367 --> 00:35:42,756
Ooh, the way
you talk gangsta, nigga!

676
00:35:59,047 --> 00:36:00,958
Yoo-hoo!

677
00:36:01,047 --> 00:36:03,038
Anybody home?

678
00:36:05,727 --> 00:36:07,080
Ain't nobody here.

679
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,965
Oh, my goodness.

680
00:36:13,927 --> 00:36:17,078
What in the hell
done happened to the mail?

681
00:36:18,887 --> 00:36:21,082
I ain't the only one they owe.

682
00:36:22,887 --> 00:36:24,320
Dirty bastards.

683
00:36:37,807 --> 00:36:40,321
This child is filthy!

684
00:36:45,807 --> 00:36:47,718
Wishful thinking.

685
00:36:52,927 --> 00:36:53,962
Weed!

686
00:36:57,407 --> 00:36:59,045
Got me some weed!

687
00:36:59,127 --> 00:37:02,005
That's why they ain't paid
their damn rent!

688
00:37:05,687 --> 00:37:08,076
So what happened after that?

689
00:37:08,167 --> 00:37:10,920
I don't want to talk about that.
Y'all ain't gonna catch no damn body.

690
00:37:11,007 --> 00:37:13,567
I just want you to stop and whip
some ass on the way to the station.

691
00:37:13,647 --> 00:37:15,239
Least I'll feel better then.

692
00:37:15,327 --> 00:37:17,045
What were you doing
in the alley, anyway?

693
00:37:17,127 --> 00:37:18,719
I was emptying the trash!

694
00:37:18,807 --> 00:37:21,275
- I had already taken it out.
- Well, it was full!

695
00:37:21,367 --> 00:37:24,165
Don't you mess with this b-b-barbecue.
I'm gonna keep my eye on you.

696
00:37:24,247 --> 00:37:28,035
I don't give a damn 'bout your lazy eye,
you Popeye-lookin' son of a--

697
00:37:28,127 --> 00:37:31,085
Nah, wait a minute!
I started this barbecue shit!

698
00:37:31,167 --> 00:37:34,000
ls this the motherfucking
thanks I get?

699
00:37:34,087 --> 00:37:35,759
That's enough! Calm down!

700
00:37:35,847 --> 00:37:38,441
I just appreciate you
even blessing me with your presence.

701
00:37:38,527 --> 00:37:42,440
Bishop Magic Don Juan
and Money motherfucking Mike!

702
00:37:42,527 --> 00:37:43,880
What they know about that?

703
00:37:43,967 --> 00:37:45,525
Let me get this straight--

704
00:37:45,607 --> 00:37:50,044
for the second time,
y'all got jacked by Santa Claus?

705
00:37:50,127 --> 00:37:51,116
Black guy, wasn't it?

706
00:37:51,207 --> 00:37:54,040
Nah. This was a nigga that did this.

707
00:37:54,127 --> 00:37:56,357
lf I build it, the hos will come.
Learn from the best.

708
00:37:56,447 --> 00:37:58,722
God bless you, Mike.
Keep your game tight, hear, player?

709
00:37:58,807 --> 00:37:59,922
Absolutely.

710
00:38:00,007 --> 00:38:01,599
...got Daddy's Rolex.

711
00:38:01,687 --> 00:38:05,316
# Dashing through these hos
in a one-horse open sleigh... #

712
00:38:05,407 --> 00:38:09,116
Everything is 25% off.
Everything must go.

713
00:38:09,207 --> 00:38:10,879
Maybe even you.

714
00:38:11,807 --> 00:38:13,877
Explain yourself now, player.

715
00:38:15,607 --> 00:38:17,882
- Day-Day!
- Ow, Daddy!

716
00:38:17,967 --> 00:38:19,036
You talk too damn much!

717
00:38:19,127 --> 00:38:21,880
He didn't want to blow
his whistle, so I blew mine.

718
00:38:23,127 --> 00:38:24,355
Pay attention!

719
00:38:24,447 --> 00:38:27,041
That's the reason we got jacked
in the first damn place.

720
00:38:27,127 --> 00:38:29,482
We'll make out our report
and get back to you.

721
00:38:31,207 --> 00:38:34,005
Guys, y'all have to get dressed.
The kids will be here any minute.

722
00:38:34,087 --> 00:38:35,361
Back to work.

723
00:38:44,007 --> 00:38:48,398
I didn't know you can make
a snowman in 80-degree weather.

724
00:38:48,487 --> 00:38:51,684
Anything is possible.
All you need is a can of snow.

725
00:38:51,767 --> 00:38:54,679
What's cracking? My name's Craig.

726
00:38:54,767 --> 00:38:56,485
- I'm Donna.
- What's up, Donna?

727
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:58,239
What kind of stuff y'all sell in here?

728
00:38:58,327 --> 00:39:01,603
We got everything--
FUBU, Sean John, Dada.

729
00:39:01,687 --> 00:39:03,757
What are you looking for?

730
00:39:03,847 --> 00:39:06,156
Anything's better than what I got on.

731
00:39:06,247 --> 00:39:08,317
What, you don't like the flashlight look?

732
00:39:10,047 --> 00:39:11,844
I see you got jokes.

733
00:39:11,927 --> 00:39:13,997
Well, you can always buy
your girlfriend something.

734
00:39:14,087 --> 00:39:15,600
We have ladies' wear, too.

735
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:17,006
Yeah, y'all do, huh?

736
00:39:17,087 --> 00:39:19,043
I don't really got
a girlfriend, you know.

737
00:39:19,127 --> 00:39:21,322
I usually get rid of them
this time of year.

738
00:39:21,407 --> 00:39:23,079
That way, you ain't got
to buy them shit.

739
00:39:24,247 --> 00:39:25,760
For real?

740
00:39:25,847 --> 00:39:26,836
Yeah, why not?

741
00:39:27,847 --> 00:39:28,882
I'm just playing.

742
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:32,606
- I see you got jokes.
- A couple.

743
00:39:32,687 --> 00:39:34,996
So that's your little
midget boyfriend?

744
00:39:35,087 --> 00:39:37,078
Little micro-mini pimp
up in there?

745
00:39:38,607 --> 00:39:40,199
Oh! What's cracking, baby?

746
00:39:40,287 --> 00:39:44,360
My name is Day-Day, right?
This is my big-head-ass cousin.

747
00:39:44,447 --> 00:39:46,756
You know, beevo-latte, got
more head than he got body.

748
00:39:46,847 --> 00:39:48,405
Check this out--

749
00:39:48,487 --> 00:39:50,205
I just spotted you
way across from the lot,

750
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:53,245
and I'm gonna let you know,
it ain't your booty, it's your beauty.

751
00:39:53,327 --> 00:39:55,761
lf you see anything
suspicious around here...

752
00:39:57,527 --> 00:39:59,358
Let me know, 'cause
I got my eyes on everything.

753
00:39:59,447 --> 00:40:00,766
Let's start off with your number.

754
00:40:00,847 --> 00:40:02,917
That's the only way we're gonna
be able to communicate.

755
00:40:03,007 --> 00:40:04,998
No, you gotta get your ass
back to that booth.

756
00:40:05,087 --> 00:40:06,805
But, man, she like me!

757
00:40:14,127 --> 00:40:15,196
Come on, woman.

758
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:17,642
I can't move that fast
with this stomach.

759
00:40:22,727 --> 00:40:24,319
Why you got to bring
your ass over here?

760
00:40:24,407 --> 00:40:27,080
I was trying to see if she seen
a Santa Claus with a suit on.

761
00:40:27,167 --> 00:40:30,955
- What your ass doing over here?
- You know what I'm doing over here.

762
00:40:32,647 --> 00:40:34,080
I just don't want no bullshit.

763
00:40:34,167 --> 00:40:35,839
You know, all that
''my hair retain heat.''

764
00:40:35,927 --> 00:40:37,201
I don't know nothin' about that.

765
00:40:37,287 --> 00:40:40,279
I'm sorry.
I have to go help them.

766
00:40:40,367 --> 00:40:42,198
Fine piece, boy.

767
00:40:42,287 --> 00:40:43,606
She fine.

768
00:40:43,687 --> 00:40:44,836
She liked me, didn't she?

769
00:40:44,927 --> 00:40:47,122
- No.
- Yes, she did.

770
00:40:47,207 --> 00:40:49,641
How she gonna like you
when she like me?

771
00:40:49,727 --> 00:40:51,365
'Cause she hadn't seen me yet.

772
00:40:51,447 --> 00:40:54,086
I wish I hadn't seen you yet.

773
00:40:54,167 --> 00:40:55,236
Can I help you?

774
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:56,840
I just walked in the store.

775
00:40:56,927 --> 00:40:59,441
Let me look around a little bit. Dang!

776
00:41:03,047 --> 00:41:05,641
I could use some help over here.
ln the men's.

777
00:41:05,727 --> 00:41:08,195
Burn a pimp,
see what happen to you.

778
00:41:08,287 --> 00:41:10,562
That's all you gotta do,

779
00:41:10,647 --> 00:41:13,081
l'd like this FUBU sweatshirt
with some socks.

780
00:41:14,127 --> 00:41:15,116
Are you all right?

781
00:41:15,207 --> 00:41:17,004
I'm fine, I just--

782
00:41:24,047 --> 00:41:26,083
This can't be happenin',

783
00:41:26,167 --> 00:41:27,600
Oh, no, player!

785
00:41:30,847 --> 00:41:33,441
Turn him off!
What the hell's wrong with him?

786
00:41:33,527 --> 00:41:36,041
Come on, Bill, let's go.
I don't see nothing in here I like.

787
00:41:36,127 --> 00:41:39,278

Baby still kicking?

Yeah, feel like twins.

791
00:41:44,207 --> 00:41:46,118

792
00:41:46,207 --> 00:41:48,243
Let me go!

Stop letting her kick your ass!

795
00:41:55,287 --> 00:41:56,640
Y'all going to jail!

796
00:41:56,727 --> 00:41:59,321
For shop-stealing
and stealing everything!

797
00:41:59,407 --> 00:42:01,079
We ain't stole shit!

798
00:42:01,167 --> 00:42:02,236
What about this?

799
00:42:02,327 --> 00:42:03,442
Uh-huh!

801
00:42:05,767 --> 00:42:09,123
- That ain't nothin' you like?

802
00:42:09,207 --> 00:42:11,562
Girl, I can't believe you did this!
I'm appalled!

803
00:42:11,647 --> 00:42:13,877
You ain't Paul!
You a nigga that steals!

804
00:42:18,207 --> 00:42:22,200
Y'all got the game messed up!
Huh? You gonna steal from a pimp?

805
00:42:27,727 --> 00:42:29,558
Where is Elroy?

806
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:31,638
He's in the back.
He doesn't want to come out.

807
00:42:31,727 --> 00:42:32,762
What?!

808
00:42:32,847 --> 00:42:34,246
Keep your voice down.

809
00:42:35,447 --> 00:42:37,677
Merry Christmas, everybody.

810
00:42:37,767 --> 00:42:40,281
Come on out here right now

811
00:42:40,367 --> 00:42:41,641
or you and I are gonna fight!

812
00:42:41,727 --> 00:42:45,003
All the money we spent for these.
Get your butt out here, man.

813
00:42:46,207 --> 00:42:48,482
Aw, Elroy, you look cute.

814
00:42:48,567 --> 00:42:50,125
Oh, he's a cutie-pie.

815
00:42:50,207 --> 00:42:52,437
We ought to be celebrating
Kwanzaa, anyway.

816
00:42:52,527 --> 00:42:55,405
Messing with these kids' heads
with this white man's holiday.

817
00:42:55,487 --> 00:42:57,125
Oh, shut up, Elroy.

818
00:42:57,207 --> 00:42:59,402
Prance your ass over
and let them kids pet on you.

819
00:42:59,487 --> 00:43:01,318
Oh, hell, no, Willie!

820
00:43:01,407 --> 00:43:04,126
That's where I put my hoof down.
Ain't nobody pettin' on me!

821
00:43:04,207 --> 00:43:06,675
Will you shut up?
Prance your ass over there!

822
00:43:06,767 --> 00:43:09,201
Let them kids pet on you.
What's wrong with you?

823
00:43:09,287 --> 00:43:11,517
That ain't prancin'. lt ain't Easter.

824
00:43:11,607 --> 00:43:12,881
I ain't know no damn reindeer.

00:43:12,967 --> 00:43:15,037

00:43:30,207 --> 00:43:32,960

833
00:43:33,047 --> 00:43:34,241

835
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:39,635

Nah, nah, let him through.

837
00:43:41,207 --> 00:43:42,481
You little shrimp motherfucker.

838
00:43:42,567 --> 00:43:44,523
I'm gonna sue your ass!
Come on, cut me!

839
00:43:44,607 --> 00:43:45,642
No, no, no!

840
00:43:47,487 --> 00:43:48,920
Give me that, give me that.

841
00:43:49,007 --> 00:43:51,123
I guarantee I wanna do my thing!

842
00:43:51,207 --> 00:43:53,767
- Think about your mama, man.
- I'm thinking about your ass.

843
00:43:53,847 --> 00:43:55,519
Think about what
your mama would say.

844
00:43:55,607 --> 00:43:57,120
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

845
00:43:57,207 --> 00:44:00,119
You know what I'm saying?
I got a little razzle-dazzled.

846
00:44:00,207 --> 00:44:02,846
My name is Money Mike, player.
How you doing?

847
00:44:02,927 --> 00:44:04,201
All right, don't squeeze hard.

848
00:44:04,287 --> 00:44:05,925
All right, what's happening?

849
00:44:06,007 --> 00:44:08,123
This is my young girl Donna.
Say hi, woman.

850
00:44:08,207 --> 00:44:09,196
What's up?

851
00:44:09,287 --> 00:44:11,005
That'll be quite enough.
Thank you so much.

852
00:44:11,087 --> 00:44:12,964
See, the thing is,
we just opened up around here,

853
00:44:13,047 --> 00:44:14,162
you know what I'm saying?

854
00:44:14,247 --> 00:44:16,602
And we've been having
some problems, obviously, as you see.

855
00:44:16,687 --> 00:44:18,200
I appreciate what y'all did

856
00:44:18,287 --> 00:44:20,482
'cause these cockroaches
would've cleaned me out.

857
00:44:20,567 --> 00:44:22,762
Speaking of cockroaches,
where was your antennas

858
00:44:22,847 --> 00:44:25,156
when them niggas were stealing
my shit out the store?

859
00:44:25,247 --> 00:44:28,045
- I didn't see them take anything.
- You didn't see 'em take anything.

860
00:44:28,127 --> 00:44:30,083
Well, look next time! Use your eyes!

861
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:33,682
They ain't supposed to just be hazel,
they supposed to do some damn work!

862
00:44:33,767 --> 00:44:35,883
This ain't for play.
I don't do this for fun.

863
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:37,002
I'm sorry.

864
00:44:37,087 --> 00:44:40,716
Don't be sorry.
Ho, be careful! Lord Je--

865
00:44:40,807 --> 00:44:42,035
You know what?

866
00:44:42,127 --> 00:44:44,118
I'm tired of your presence. Dismissed.

867
00:44:44,207 --> 00:44:45,925
Nice meeting you guys.

868
00:44:46,007 --> 00:44:47,520
See you later.

869
00:44:48,607 --> 00:44:51,041
You got her trained, nigga, damn!

870
00:44:51,127 --> 00:44:54,199
You can lead a ho to water, player,
but you can't make 'em think.

871
00:44:54,287 --> 00:44:55,481
You dig what I'm sayin'?

872
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:57,159
I got to keep it
breezy around this bitch.

873
00:44:57,247 --> 00:44:58,805
Anyway, I need to take care of y'all.

874
00:44:58,887 --> 00:45:00,525
I appreciate
what y'all did for a player.

875
00:45:00,607 --> 00:45:02,245
I can't be everywhere at all times.

876
00:45:02,327 --> 00:45:03,316
No charge.

877
00:45:03,407 --> 00:45:05,045
- What about our rent money?
- No charge.

878
00:45:05,127 --> 00:45:06,685
Y'all sure?

879
00:45:06,767 --> 00:45:09,839
Positive. We just doing our job.
We can't charge you, man.

880
00:45:09,927 --> 00:45:11,280
Don't argue with ''no charge.''

881
00:45:11,367 --> 00:45:13,085
You can come to the store
anytime you want.

882
00:45:13,167 --> 00:45:15,601
Can we get some clothes,
30% off, 40% off?

883
00:45:15,687 --> 00:45:17,837
- A FUBU short set?
- You don't need shit.

884
00:45:17,927 --> 00:45:19,519
Man.

885
00:45:19,607 --> 00:45:22,075
Look, we just having a little
Christmas party tonight.

886
00:45:22,167 --> 00:45:25,239
Why don't you and your lady come or
hang out with us and our folks?

887
00:45:25,327 --> 00:45:27,158
Let me check my Palm Pilot.

888
00:45:28,287 --> 00:45:29,720
Look like I ain't doin' shit.

889
00:45:29,807 --> 00:45:30,876
Bring a bunch of bitches--

890
00:45:30,967 --> 00:45:33,606
I'm talking about
a busload of them hos if you can.

891
00:45:33,687 --> 00:45:36,759
I was gonna get drunk and watch
The Grinch. so I'll be there.

892
00:45:36,847 --> 00:45:39,361
I'll get the address from y'all later.
I'll see you later, too.

893
00:45:39,447 --> 00:45:41,085
Yo, yo, player, hold up.

894
00:45:41,167 --> 00:45:42,646
Never know
what I might need this for.

895
00:45:42,727 --> 00:45:45,605
Might want to shave.
Might want to shave somebody else!

896
00:45:45,687 --> 00:45:47,166
Never know.

897
00:45:48,407 --> 00:45:49,840
I like that nigga! I like him!

898
00:45:49,927 --> 00:45:52,646
Look, that's real pimpin'.
Now, that's pimpin'.

899
00:45:52,727 --> 00:45:54,604
Get off his dick, Day-Day.

900
00:45:55,847 --> 00:45:57,405
What do you want
for Christmas, young fella?

901
00:45:57,487 --> 00:46:00,479
I want a X-Box with all the games,
all the new gear,

902
00:46:00,567 --> 00:46:02,842
a new Lexus
with a banging system

903
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:04,406
and chrome feet on it.

904
00:46:05,647 --> 00:46:07,683
Here's my address, Mr. Jones.

905
00:46:07,767 --> 00:46:09,758
Mr. Jones?

906
00:46:09,847 --> 00:46:11,803
No, Santa.

907
00:46:11,887 --> 00:46:14,082
- I'm Santa.
- Bullshit! You Mr. Jones.

908
00:46:14,167 --> 00:46:17,000
I know where you live, too,
so I expect everything by tomorrow.

909
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:18,076
You feel me?

910
00:46:18,167 --> 00:46:20,476
Put everything in my mom's name.

911
00:46:20,567 --> 00:46:22,842
He don't look like no reindeer,
he look like a pit bull.

912
00:46:22,927 --> 00:46:24,326
Giddy-up, pit bull.

913
00:46:24,407 --> 00:46:28,036
You better stop jumping up and down
before I have to bite your little ass.

914
00:46:28,127 --> 00:46:30,322
Can you lock your jaws
and shake like a pit bull?

915
00:46:30,407 --> 00:46:32,318
Yeah. Want me to show you?

916
00:46:32,407 --> 00:46:35,046
My brother said if a pit bull
locks his jaws like that,

917
00:46:35,127 --> 00:46:37,163
you're supposed to do this to him...

918
00:46:39,607 --> 00:46:42,246
I didn't have to take anything.
lt was all her. Come on, man.

919
00:46:42,327 --> 00:46:44,204
Take her! Let me go! Come on!

920
00:46:45,927 --> 00:46:48,600
- Later, Moly.
- Okay, buddy, take care.

921
00:46:48,687 --> 00:46:50,359
A-Team!

922
00:46:51,287 --> 00:46:54,085
# Bad boys!
What you gonna do? #

923
00:46:54,167 --> 00:46:56,123
Dodo! Good job, buddy.

924
00:46:56,207 --> 00:46:57,799
- Thanks.
- You, too, Clyde.

925
00:46:57,887 --> 00:47:00,685
- Take lunch, one half-hour.
- That's cool right there.

926
00:47:00,767 --> 00:47:02,200
Don't be late.

927
00:47:04,567 --> 00:47:06,239
That's a dirty motherfucker.

928
00:47:06,327 --> 00:47:08,158
He blowin' smoke in our face
on the first arrest?

929
00:47:08,247 --> 00:47:09,282
That's bullshit.

930
00:47:09,367 --> 00:47:11,801
I told you there ain't no future
in being a company man.

931
00:47:11,887 --> 00:47:14,276
- Let's just go to lunch.
- Let's go. I'm hungry.

932
00:47:15,527 --> 00:47:17,085
Ain't that...

933
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:19,442
Get them niggas! Come on, sugars!

934

00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:30,002
Pimping ain't easy but--

951
00:48:30,087 --> 00:48:31,076
No!

00:48:33,167 --> 00:48:34,520
Get your fake ass out of my way!

954
00:48:34,607 --> 00:48:36,962
Oh, this is bullshit.

955
00:48:37,047 --> 00:48:39,117
I'm in between
a pimp and a hard place.

956
00:48:40,327 --> 00:48:45,037
Donna! Man down!
1 1-30! Pimp in distress!

957
00:48:45,127 --> 00:48:46,640
Oh, Lord, where the hell is Donna?

958
00:48:46,727 --> 00:48:48,843
- Can I help you?
- Yo, move!

959
00:48:48,927 --> 00:48:51,282

- What's your problem? Move!

960
00:48:51,367 --> 00:48:53,437
- I can't let you back there.
- Why? Who back there?

961
00:48:53,527 --> 00:48:54,562
Did you hear me?!

962
00:48:54,647 --> 00:48:57,115
Go, go, go!

963
00:49:02,127 --> 00:49:04,516

Let's jump. Let's jump.

970
00:49:42,807 --> 00:49:45,958
Yo, Moly! I heard

971
00:49:46,047 --> 00:49:48,083
that's been harassing
my grandmother and things.

972
00:49:48,167 --> 00:49:49,316
Two new guys--Clyde and Dodo.

973
00:49:49,407 --> 00:49:52,001
You remember what we did
to the last security guards?

974
00:49:52,087 --> 00:49:53,918
Yes, I do, buddy.

975
00:49:54,007 --> 00:49:57,795
When you see them,
you tell them we said this...

976
00:49:57,887 --> 00:50:00,355
Help! Somebody, help me!
Help me, please!

977
00:50:00,447 --> 00:50:02,085
Somebody, help me, please!

978
00:50:03,927 --> 00:50:05,997
Did you see
what they just did to Moly?

979
00:50:06,087 --> 00:50:07,998
They gonna kick our ass
when they catch us.

980
00:50:08,087 --> 00:50:10,078
That's why
they ain't gonna catch us.

981
00:50:13,807 --> 00:50:15,365
Where them rent-a-cops at, huh?

982
00:50:17,447 --> 00:50:20,564
What you looking at, old man?
Mind your own fuckin' business.

983
00:50:20,647 --> 00:50:23,002
Come on. Let's just jump
on Moly's car.

984
00:50:23,087 --> 00:50:24,520
Craig, I'm scared, man.

985
00:50:24,607 --> 00:50:27,075
So what? Me, too.

986
00:50:30,007 --> 00:50:30,996
Oh, fuck this.

987
00:50:31,087 --> 00:50:33,999
I'm not about to get my motherfuckin'
ass kicked over no job!

988
00:50:34,087 --> 00:50:36,157
You smart as a motherfucker today.

989
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:38,720
Shit.

990
00:50:40,087 --> 00:50:41,315
This way.

991
00:50:42,727 --> 00:50:44,399
Oh, shit!

992
00:50:47,087 --> 00:50:49,157
Wow! Oh, my God!

993
00:50:49,247 --> 00:50:50,919

996
00:50:58,047 --> 00:51:00,845
Oh, good observation, buddy.
Where were you, buddy, huh?

997
00:51:00,927 --> 00:51:02,485
We was on our lunch break.

998
00:51:02,567 --> 00:51:05,365
Trying to get something to eat
so we could secure this nasty-ass lot.

999
00:51:05,447 --> 00:51:07,597
Good, you were eating
while I was getting beating.

1000
00:51:07,687 --> 00:51:10,155
Look like somebody beat the bricks
off your motherfucking ass.

1001
00:51:10,247 --> 00:51:11,839
You're supposed to be
security guard, no?

1002
00:51:11,927 --> 00:51:13,565
We are security. Ain't that a bitch?

1003
00:51:13,647 --> 00:51:15,239
We are security guards.

1004
00:51:16,367 --> 00:51:17,846
Oh, no, not anymore.
You're both fired.

1005
00:51:17,927 --> 00:51:19,280
Oh, man!

00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:20,641
Man, what the fuck?

1007
00:51:20,727 --> 00:51:21,921
Oh, hell, no!

1008
00:51:22,007 --> 00:51:24,680
We just got this job!

I don't know. I'm not
even in the spirit no more.

1030
00:52:22,247 --> 00:52:24,602

00:55:19,607 --> 00:55:20,756
We miss you down there!

1092
00:55:20,847 --> 00:55:22,838
Man, I know y'all do.
Why'd you fire me, Pink?

1093
00:55:22,927 --> 00:55:25,805
I had to! You was always late, fool!

1094
00:55:25,887 --> 00:55:27,036
Say it again!

1095
00:55:27,167 --> 00:55:28,236
Say it again!

1096
00:55:36,407 --> 00:55:38,079
Damn, girl, you eating again?

1097
00:55:42,447 --> 00:55:43,960
What's up O.G., triple O.G.?

1098
00:55:44,047 --> 00:55:46,083
- What's up?
- How you doing, man?

1099
00:55:46,167 --> 00:55:47,236
Everything all right?

1100
00:55:47,327 --> 00:55:49,079
- I'm cool, dawg.
- Good.

1101
00:55:49,167 --> 00:55:52,921
Got my shank in case
shit jump off in this motherfucker.

1102
00:55:53,007 --> 00:55:55,396
Relax, homey, ain't nothin'
about to jump off in here.

1103
00:55:55,487 --> 00:55:57,637
That's my people, man!
That's my folks.

1104
00:55:57,727 --> 00:55:59,638
My grandma, my uncle.

1105
00:56:02,247 --> 00:56:04,715
What you need to do, man,
is grab one of these females

1106
00:56:04,807 --> 00:56:06,160
and get your boogie on.

1107
00:56:06,247 --> 00:56:08,442
I don't want to dance
with none of these hos.

1108
00:56:08,527 --> 00:56:09,721
You're a fool.

1109
00:56:11,727 --> 00:56:13,957
Ooh, what's up?

1110
00:56:14,047 --> 00:56:15,799
Merry Christmas.

1111
00:56:15,887 --> 00:56:17,081
Who is that?

1112
00:56:17,167 --> 00:56:18,361
How are you?

1113
00:56:18,447 --> 00:56:19,880
Oh, I'm all right.

1114
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:20,956
You look great.

1115
00:56:21,047 --> 00:56:24,437
That's, uh, that's Donna.

1116
00:56:24,527 --> 00:56:26,199
You the greenest
little troll I ever seen!

1117
00:56:26,287 --> 00:56:28,517
Who the nigga she with?

1118
00:56:28,607 --> 00:56:30,086
That's just Money Mike.

1119
00:56:30,167 --> 00:56:33,443
Little Lucky Charms,
little micro-mini pimp.

1120
00:56:33,527 --> 00:56:36,041
Oh, that nigga look
magically delicious, nigga.

1121
00:56:36,127 --> 00:56:37,640
That's right.

1122
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:38,796
Perm and shit.

1123
00:56:38,887 --> 00:56:40,320
Craig, look who here!

1124
00:56:40,407 --> 00:56:43,080
Yeah, bring him over here.
Bring his ass right here.

1125
00:56:43,167 --> 00:56:45,522
Oh, man, thanks
for coming through, man.

1126
00:56:45,607 --> 00:56:47,199
I appreciate that.

1127
00:56:47,287 --> 00:56:48,845
No problem.
Thanks for inviting us.

1128
00:56:48,927 --> 00:56:52,203
We had to show y'all some love
after what y'all did for us at the store.

1129
00:56:52,287 --> 00:56:53,845
Don't she look good?

1130
00:56:53,927 --> 00:56:55,724
lntroduce me to your friend, Craig.

1131
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:59,117
Oh, that's Money Mike.

1132
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:00,799
- That's Donna.
- Hi. Merry Christmas.

1133
00:57:00,887 --> 00:57:03,276
This Damon. He live downstairs.

1134
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:07,327
That was like The Matrix!

1135
00:57:07,407 --> 00:57:09,967
Got some testosterone problems.

1136
00:57:10,047 --> 00:57:12,607
Why don't you go get me
something to drink, please?

1137
00:57:12,687 --> 00:57:13,961
Thank you.

1138
00:57:14,047 --> 00:57:15,924
- Where is it?
- Right through here.

1139
00:57:18,167 --> 00:57:19,156
No, no.

1140
00:57:21,887 --> 00:57:24,321
Like to dislocated my shoulder.

1141
00:57:24,407 --> 00:57:27,365
Yo, homey, you ever been to the pen?

1142
00:57:27,447 --> 00:57:32,362
Hell, no, but thanks for asking.
Won't bother asking you, though.

1143
00:57:32,447 --> 00:57:35,245
- Uh, Craig?
- Yeah.

1144
00:57:35,327 --> 00:57:36,601
Where your bathroom at, player?

1145
00:57:36,687 --> 00:57:38,359
I got to piss
like a Russian racehorse

1146
00:57:38,447 --> 00:57:40,802
at the Kentucky Derby
with a glue truck behind him.

1147
00:57:44,167 --> 00:57:45,486
Yo, it's right through there.

1148
00:57:45,567 --> 00:57:47,956
I got to pee diddy! About to get it on.

1149
00:57:48,047 --> 00:57:50,163
Hey, don't piss on the seat.

1150
00:57:59,567 --> 00:58:01,762
What's up, O.G., triple O.G.?

1151
00:58:01,847 --> 00:58:03,405
You got that look in your eye.

1152
00:58:03,487 --> 00:58:05,523
Fresh fish on the line, nigga.

1153
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:07,484
Ain't nothin' like that shit.

1154
00:58:10,927 --> 00:58:13,157
Yeah, baby! Yeah!

1155
00:58:14,287 --> 00:58:17,677
Have to drink a little bit more water.
Smell like ammonia in this bitch.

1156
00:58:17,767 --> 00:58:19,359
Come on. There you go.

1157
00:58:21,127 --> 00:58:23,800
One at a time, player, one at a time.

1158
00:58:23,887 --> 00:58:25,479
Busy right now,
working with a monster.

1159
00:58:25,567 --> 00:58:27,205
You know what this is, new booty!

1160
00:58:27,287 --> 00:58:29,084
- New booty?
- Don't fight the shit.

1161
00:58:29,167 --> 00:58:30,600
- Fight what shit?
- Let it happen.

1162
00:58:30,687 --> 00:58:32,723
Let what happen?
What the hell you doing?

1163
00:58:32,807 --> 00:58:35,196
Phone books? Nigga,
I ain't even in the phone book.

1164
00:58:35,287 --> 00:58:38,563
This ain't funny, nigga.
I'll bitch-slap your ass.

1165
00:58:38,647 --> 00:58:39,875
Come on, I ain't playin'.

1166
00:58:39,967 --> 00:58:42,356
No!

1167
00:58:43,607 --> 00:58:46,360
Here's my card right here
if y'all ever want to be pimped.

1168
00:58:46,447 --> 00:58:47,516
Day-Day.

1169
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:50,519
Better not let Pinky see that shit.
We ought to give it to him, though.

1170
00:58:50,607 --> 00:58:52,120
That's a barbecue card.

1171
00:58:52,207 --> 00:58:55,040
Don't give a fuck. That's where
I'm pimping, out of the barbecue place.

1172
00:58:55,127 --> 00:58:58,358
Come and get
barbecue-slapped. Shit.

1173
00:59:00,327 --> 00:59:02,682
Sneaky son of a bitch.

1174
00:59:02,767 --> 00:59:04,564
Damn, he's been
in there a long time.

1175
00:59:04,647 --> 00:59:06,046
I told you he was sick.

1176
00:59:06,127 --> 00:59:08,243
He might be in there
throwing up anything.

1177
00:59:08,327 --> 00:59:09,919
Why don't we just step in here?

1178
00:59:10,007 --> 00:59:11,759
We can sit down
and wait for him in here.

1179
00:59:13,047 --> 00:59:14,446
All right.

1180
00:59:23,647 --> 00:59:26,923
You got a nice room here.
Pretty clean for a bachelor.

1181
00:59:27,007 --> 00:59:30,443
I got a nice bed, too.
Wanna try it?

1182
00:59:30,527 --> 00:59:33,200
- You funny, huh?
- I'm not trying to be funny.

1183
00:59:33,287 --> 00:59:36,199
I'm trying to spread
a little holiday cheer,

1184
00:59:36,287 --> 00:59:38,676
get close to you.

1185
00:59:41,087 --> 00:59:43,965
So, what brings you to California

1186
00:59:44,047 --> 00:59:47,005
with this little
half-a-Prince motherfucker?

1187
00:59:47,087 --> 00:59:49,078
You know, I ask myself
that same question.

1188
00:59:49,167 --> 00:59:51,920
What am I doing way out here,

1189
00:59:52,007 --> 00:59:56,922
away from my family
this time of year?

1190
00:59:57,007 --> 00:59:59,760
But it's just hard.

1191
00:59:59,847 --> 01:00:02,156
Shit, just leave.

1192
01:00:02,247 --> 01:00:04,636
You don't understand.
lt's not that easy.

1193
01:00:05,807 --> 01:00:08,401
I mean, he got you
all the way out here

1194
01:00:08,487 --> 01:00:11,923
so he can, you know,
mistreat you,

1195
01:00:12,007 --> 01:00:13,725
do all them things to you--

1196
01:00:13,807 --> 01:00:16,002
you know, I want
to do some things to you

1197
01:00:16,087 --> 01:00:17,918
that, um...

1198
01:00:18,927 --> 01:00:21,316
You sure you don't want
to just, like, lean back?

1199
01:00:21,407 --> 01:00:23,523
What you think?

1200
01:00:26,367 --> 01:00:27,595
No!

1201
01:00:27,687 --> 01:00:28,961
Don't do it!

1202
01:00:29,047 --> 01:00:30,321
You got some condoms?

1203
01:00:30,407 --> 01:00:32,523
Day-Day, get the hell out of here!

1204
01:00:32,607 --> 01:00:35,121
You know damn well you got
all the rubbers in your--

1205
01:00:35,207 --> 01:00:37,926
Get the fuck out of here!

1206
01:00:38,007 --> 01:00:39,725
She liked me anyway, didn't you?

1207
01:00:40,807 --> 01:00:41,956
You're a trip.

1208
01:00:42,047 --> 01:00:44,436
You know what? Don't pay
no attention to Day-Day.

1209
01:00:44,527 --> 01:00:46,882
- That boy, he just a fool.
- You know what?

1210
01:00:46,967 --> 01:00:49,800
Let's just go before
Mike comes busting in on us.

1211
01:00:50,767 --> 01:00:54,476
And, Craig, a word of advice--
you should get a lock on this door.

1212
01:00:56,367 --> 01:00:58,323
I ain't never gonna get no pussy.

1213
01:00:59,407 --> 01:01:02,046
What if I tried to get
a lock right now and just--

1214
01:01:03,807 --> 01:01:05,035
All right. God!

1215
01:01:06,087 --> 01:01:08,647
- Come on out of there!
- Pop, what's the matter?

1216
01:01:08,727 --> 01:01:09,955
Who's in the bathroom?

1217
01:01:10,047 --> 01:01:11,765
That eggnog about
to kick back up on me.

1218
01:01:11,847 --> 01:01:13,075
You know I got them bad guts.

1219
01:01:13,167 --> 01:01:15,317
Man, Pops gotta boo-boo, come on!

1220
01:01:15,407 --> 01:01:16,965
Don't tell everybody!

1221
01:01:17,047 --> 01:01:18,526
Hey, you know what?

1222
01:01:18,607 --> 01:01:20,882
The lady will let you
use it downstairs, the landlady.

1223
01:01:20,967 --> 01:01:21,956
Miss Pearly.

1224
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:24,197
Go on down. She'll let you use it.

1225
01:01:24,287 --> 01:01:26,039
Come on out of there, man!

1226
01:01:28,367 --> 01:01:29,766
Honey, where you going?

1227
01:01:29,847 --> 01:01:32,042
I'll be right back. Oh, boy!

1228
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:56,118
All right!

1229
01:01:57,167 --> 01:01:58,680
All right!

1230
01:01:58,767 --> 01:02:01,679
I'm Craig's daddy--Willie Jones.

1231
01:02:01,767 --> 01:02:04,281
As you know, we're having
a little get-together upstairs,

1232
01:02:04,367 --> 01:02:06,403
and the bathrooms are jammed.

1233
01:02:06,487 --> 01:02:08,125
I like the way you got that lined up.

1234
01:02:08,207 --> 01:02:09,765
Mind if I use yours?

1235
01:02:09,967 --> 01:02:11,195
No. Come on in.

1236
01:02:11,287 --> 01:02:13,403
- Where's it at?
- Down the hall.

1237
01:02:13,487 --> 01:02:14,840
Thank you.

1238
01:02:19,207 --> 01:02:20,959
All right, there we go.

1239
01:02:23,527 --> 01:02:26,041
There we go. About time.

1240
01:02:26,127 --> 01:02:28,357
Oh, just what I needed so bad.

1241
01:02:29,567 --> 01:02:32,320
Yeah, there it is.

1242
01:02:39,687 --> 01:02:40,756
How you doing?

1243
01:02:40,847 --> 01:02:43,407
Show me what you working with.

1244
01:02:43,487 --> 01:02:45,717
- Oh, damn!
- What's wrong with you, fool?

1245
01:02:45,807 --> 01:02:47,445
That's my woman you're dancing with.

1246
01:02:47,527 --> 01:02:49,324
Hey, fool, your woman's
freaking with me!

1247
01:02:49,407 --> 01:02:50,760
I bought them titties!

1248
01:02:50,847 --> 01:02:52,041
What's wrong with you?

1249
01:02:52,287 --> 01:02:53,766
I'll bust a cap right in your fat ass.

1250
01:02:53,847 --> 01:02:55,041
Don't mess up the party, Elroy.

1251
01:02:55,127 --> 01:02:57,925
Dance with me, dance with me.
Come on, dance with me.

1252
01:03:03,527 --> 01:03:05,085
Did you pee on me?

1253
01:03:05,167 --> 01:03:08,159
Wake your bitch-ass up,
Lucky Charms.

1254
01:03:08,247 --> 01:03:10,636
I like my fish wet and squirmy.

1255
01:03:10,727 --> 01:03:13,924
I thought I was dreaming.
You almost drowned me, nigga.

1256
01:03:14,007 --> 01:03:16,362
Oh, you dreaming. This a wet dream.

1257
01:03:16,447 --> 01:03:18,722
Wet dream?
Wait a minute, I'm a pimp!

1258
01:03:18,807 --> 01:03:20,798
You lost your mind? What the hell?!

1259
01:03:20,887 --> 01:03:21,922
Am I in prison?

1260
01:03:22,007 --> 01:03:23,838
Donna! Pimp down!

1261
01:03:26,647 --> 01:03:29,161
You got a lot of balls!

1262
01:03:30,607 --> 01:03:34,156
Pimpin', pimpin', pimpin'!

1263
01:03:38,207 --> 01:03:40,437
You was just gonna take it,
wasn't you? Hmm?

1264
01:03:40,527 --> 01:03:42,404
You thought I was
play-pimping, didn't you?

1265
01:03:42,487 --> 01:03:44,159
Yeah, okay, okay.

1266
01:03:47,607 --> 01:03:49,438
- Could you just let me go?
- Say something.

1267
01:03:49,527 --> 01:03:52,087
I was just playing with you.

1268
01:03:52,167 --> 01:03:54,078
I was playing with you, dawg.

1269
01:03:54,167 --> 01:03:55,646
I was playing, man, okay?

1270
01:03:55,727 --> 01:03:57,922
I'm a nice guy
when you get to know me.

1271
01:03:58,007 --> 01:04:00,760
Shut up! What the hell
you talking about?

1272
01:04:00,847 --> 01:04:03,520
I am a boy!

1273
01:04:03,607 --> 01:04:07,282
You are not in prison
anymore, Damon!

1274
01:04:07,367 --> 01:04:09,119
That's not how we do it!

1275
01:04:10,807 --> 01:04:14,436
Say, noog! This is Pinky, noogah!
Look, I got to go pee-pee!

1276
01:04:14,527 --> 01:04:17,519
Uh, Damon, are you a music lover?

1277
01:04:17,607 --> 01:04:20,121
You are? Good. Have you
ever heard of The Nutcracker?

1278
01:04:20,207 --> 01:04:22,357
Oh, shit!

1279
01:04:22,447 --> 01:04:23,960
Have you, huh? Have you heard it?

1280
01:04:24,047 --> 01:04:25,321
Huh? Huh?

1281
01:04:25,407 --> 01:04:27,796
Yes. Yes.

1282
01:04:29,367 --> 01:04:32,803
# Crunching on your balls
in a one-horse open sleigh... #

1283
01:04:36,727 --> 01:04:38,080
Mom, what's the matter?

1284
01:04:38,167 --> 01:04:40,317
Where did your father go?

1285
01:04:40,407 --> 01:04:42,523
He just went downstairs
to use the bathroom

1286
01:04:42,607 --> 01:04:44,438
over at Miss Pearly's, the landlady.

1287
01:04:44,527 --> 01:04:48,725
Oh, Miss Pearly. Hmm...

1288
01:04:48,807 --> 01:04:49,956
Excuse me.

1289
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:54,396
Mama.

1290
01:04:55,447 --> 01:04:57,085
Oh, shit!

1291
01:04:57,167 --> 01:04:58,282
Hey!

1292
01:05:00,087 --> 01:05:03,079
Should be a law against
people with guts like mine.

1293
01:05:03,167 --> 01:05:05,601
That was a monster--
Why it so dark in here, baby?

1294
01:05:05,687 --> 01:05:07,484
What are you about to do,
pray or something?

1295
01:05:07,567 --> 01:05:09,717
Did your son tell you I said hi?

1296
01:05:11,727 --> 01:05:13,445
No. Pertaining to what?

1297
01:05:13,527 --> 01:05:16,200
Your son Craig
ain't paid his rent this month,

1298
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:19,279
and I'm about to throw him
out on his ass tomorrow.

1299
01:05:19,367 --> 01:05:21,722
So how much do you
really love your boy?

1300
01:05:21,807 --> 01:05:25,243
Not enough to pay his fucking rent.
I have enough trouble paying my own!

1301
01:05:25,327 --> 01:05:28,046
I'm not talking about rent,
Willie Jones.

1302
01:05:28,127 --> 01:05:30,197
Well, what you talking about,
Miss Pearly?

1303
01:05:30,287 --> 01:05:32,323
I'm talking about these nuts!

1304
01:05:34,607 --> 01:05:36,837
You're gonna give me
some of this dick today!

1305
01:05:36,927 --> 01:05:38,645
I don't even know you, woman!

1306
01:05:38,727 --> 01:05:40,479
I heard they call you
''Sweet-Dick Willie.''

1307
01:05:40,567 --> 01:05:41,716
- Who, me?
- Yeah!

1308
01:05:41,807 --> 01:05:43,479
- You heard that, huh?
- Yeah.

1309
01:05:43,567 --> 01:05:45,444
Yes, baby, I'm a bad mother.

1310
01:05:45,527 --> 01:05:48,883
- Can I have some of it?
- Let me go, woman! Hell, no!

1311
01:05:48,967 --> 01:05:50,036
I don't know you, woman!

1312
01:05:50,127 --> 01:05:51,480
Oh, Sweet-Dick Willie!

1313
01:05:51,567 --> 01:05:53,797
Willie, get your ass off that heifer!

1314
01:05:54,727 --> 01:05:57,116
Daddy, get your ass off that heifer!

1315
01:05:59,887 --> 01:06:01,878
Yeah, pimping!

1316
01:06:04,127 --> 01:06:06,766
That's right.

1317
01:06:06,847 --> 01:06:08,883
Hey, I want everybody back!

1318
01:06:08,967 --> 01:06:11,276
There's gonna be
ball juice everywhere!

1319
01:06:11,367 --> 01:06:13,119
Everybody get back!

1320
01:06:13,207 --> 01:06:14,481
Get back in the house!

1321
01:06:16,047 --> 01:06:18,402
Don't take anybody!

1322
01:06:19,527 --> 01:06:21,165
Y'all get the hell
out of my house!

1323
01:06:21,247 --> 01:06:23,044
My dick wouldn't get hard!

1324
01:06:23,127 --> 01:06:24,845
Whip his ass, Mama!

1325
01:06:24,927 --> 01:06:27,395
Miss Pearly, you ain't right,
trying to give my daddy V.D.

1326
01:06:27,487 --> 01:06:29,398
I'm calling the police on y'all, fool!

1327
01:06:29,487 --> 01:06:31,637
Well, get that lined up,
too, first, bitch!

1328
01:06:31,727 --> 01:06:33,001
Go to hell!

1329
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:36,045
Player. Player!

1330
01:06:36,127 --> 01:06:37,162
What's going on?

1331
01:06:37,247 --> 01:06:38,282
Ain't nothin', player.

1332
01:06:38,367 --> 01:06:40,244
Thanks for inviting me. I appreciate it.

1333
01:06:40,327 --> 01:06:41,362
Donna, get the car.

1334
01:06:41,447 --> 01:06:42,880
Come on, player.

1335
01:06:42,967 --> 01:06:44,605
Hey, them my vise grips, man!

1336
01:06:44,687 --> 01:06:48,157
Yeah, that's his nuts, too.
You can have them both back!

1337
01:06:48,247 --> 01:06:49,919
Look, I'm just saying, man,

1338
01:06:50,007 --> 01:06:51,918
let him go, and there
won't be no hard feelings.

1339
01:06:52,007 --> 01:06:53,042
No hard feelings?

1340
01:06:53,127 --> 01:06:55,038
Have you ever seen
a rottweiler bite a chihuahua?

1341
01:06:55,127 --> 01:06:56,446
No.

1342
01:06:56,527 --> 01:06:58,995
Me, neither, but it
ain't pretty, I'm sure of it.

1343
01:06:59,087 --> 01:07:00,759
Now you hold on
till I get in the car.

1344
01:07:00,847 --> 01:07:04,920
Dude, I'm not about to touch
his nuts or them vise grips.

1345
01:07:05,007 --> 01:07:07,043
- Oh, yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.

1346
01:07:07,127 --> 01:07:09,083
- Yes, you are!
- Bullshit.

1347
01:07:09,167 --> 01:07:11,237
You invited me to this party,
ain't that right?

1348
01:07:11,327 --> 01:07:13,887
That's right. Whatever
y'all do, make it quick.

1349
01:07:13,967 --> 01:07:15,923
I think I'm gonna pass out.

1350
01:07:16,007 --> 01:07:17,042
No, no, no--

1351
01:07:17,127 --> 01:07:19,641
lt's your party, your pliers,
his nuts in your hand.

1352
01:07:19,727 --> 01:07:22,082
That's how it's going.
Donna, get the door.

1353
01:07:22,167 --> 01:07:23,964
I'll get the car door.

1354
01:07:25,167 --> 01:07:27,397
Give me a call
when you get a chance.

1355
01:07:27,487 --> 01:07:29,443
Yeah.

1356
01:07:29,527 --> 01:07:31,324
I'll call you.

1357
01:07:31,407 --> 01:07:33,443
Hold on.

1358
01:07:33,527 --> 01:07:35,802
[SlLENTLY] Call me.

1359
01:07:35,887 --> 01:07:36,956
- Hey!
- What?!

1360
01:07:37,047 --> 01:07:38,878
- Can you hear me now?
- Yeah.

1361
01:07:38,967 --> 01:07:40,480
Get these pliers!

1362
01:07:40,567 --> 01:07:41,966
All right. You ready?

1363
01:07:42,047 --> 01:07:43,275
I'm ready. I'm ready.

1364
01:07:43,367 --> 01:07:44,925
- You ready?
- Oh, I'm ready, player.

1365
01:07:45,007 --> 01:07:46,804
On the count of three--

1366
01:07:46,887 --> 01:07:48,957
- Here we go. One...
- On your balls...

1367
01:07:49,047 --> 01:07:50,400
- Two...
- Grab a handful...

1368
01:07:50,487 --> 01:07:52,159
- Three!
- Go!

1369
01:07:53,287 --> 01:07:54,686
Hey!

1370
01:07:54,767 --> 01:07:58,476
Donna, you can't leave me!
Hey, pimp in distress!

1371
01:07:58,567 --> 01:08:00,523
Bitch, I ain't--hold on!

1372
01:08:00,607 --> 01:08:03,041
How the fuck
you gonna leave me?!

1373
01:08:03,127 --> 01:08:05,197
He gonna fuck the lining
out of Little Prince.

1374
01:08:05,287 --> 01:08:08,836
Code 1 1-32--pimp missing!

1375
01:08:12,887 --> 01:08:13,876
What?

1376
01:08:13,967 --> 01:08:15,400
You see that mother?

1377
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:17,318
That-that's--

1378
01:08:17,407 --> 01:08:19,967
He the one
broke in the apartment!

1379
01:08:36,887 --> 01:08:37,876
You see him?

1380
01:08:37,967 --> 01:08:40,037
Yeah, he just went
through there on the side.

1381
01:08:47,967 --> 01:08:51,164
- You ready?
- I'm not going in there, man.

1382
01:08:51,247 --> 01:08:54,205
Stop being so scary.
All our stuff might be in there.

1383
01:08:54,287 --> 01:08:56,801
Why you always
got to be a hero, man?

1384
01:08:56,887 --> 01:08:58,036
Take your--go over there.

1385
01:08:58,127 --> 01:09:00,766
I bet something bite you in the ass.
I'm not going.

1386
01:09:00,847 --> 01:09:02,963
No, I don't want
to get bit in the ass.

1387
01:09:03,047 --> 01:09:05,402
Ten more minutes before Christmas.

1388
01:09:05,487 --> 01:09:08,684
Ten more minutes.
That's what I'm talking about.

1389
01:09:08,767 --> 01:09:13,238
Lord have mercy,
I'm tired as a runaway slave.

1390
01:09:13,327 --> 01:09:14,885
Let's see what I got.

1391
01:09:14,967 --> 01:09:17,003
Don't nobody get me nothin', anyway.

1392
01:09:18,887 --> 01:09:20,559
Oh, snap.

1393
01:09:20,647 --> 01:09:22,763
Dada.
I always wanted me a Dada.

1394
01:09:22,847 --> 01:09:24,485
Hell, yeah.

1395
01:09:24,567 --> 01:09:27,286
Extra medium?
Extra medium?

1396
01:09:27,367 --> 01:09:30,279
Hell, got to have something
for the skinny niggas.

1397
01:09:30,367 --> 01:09:33,040
Day-Day, this could be
our last chance.

1398
01:09:33,127 --> 01:09:36,119
You keep your timid ass here.
I'm going to get my shit.

1399
01:09:38,647 --> 01:09:41,115
Yeah, I roll to the club
just like this, baby.

1400
01:09:41,207 --> 01:09:44,279
Santa Claus up here,
grabbing me some wallets,

1401
01:09:44,367 --> 01:09:47,086
cigarette lighters, some car keys.

- Yo, Day-Day.

1479
01:15:09,087 --> 01:15:11,078
I'm glad we got
our rent money back, baby.

1480
01:15:11,167 --> 01:15:12,725
What are we gonna do
with that fool?

1481
01:15:12,807 --> 01:15:15,082
I don't know. Po-pos will get
his dumb ass sooner or later.

1482
01:15:15,167 --> 01:15:18,159
Ho ho ho, motherfucker!

1483
01:15:18,247 --> 01:15:19,760
There you have it.

1484
01:15:19,847 --> 01:15:23,044
Another Friday gone.

1485
01:15:24,327 --> 01:15:25,999
Wejust took oun stuff
back to the panty

1486
01:15:26,087 --> 01:15:29,079
and left Santa Claus on the roof
for the police to get.

1487
01:15:29,167 --> 01:15:33,604
Fan as I know.

1488
01:15:33,687 --> 01:15:36,838
Pimp down!

1489
01:15:36,927 --> 01:15:38,155
And Money Mike.

1490
01:15:38,247 --> 01:15:40,078
you know. he's still
getting chased by Damon

1491
01:15:40,167 --> 01:15:41,600
all through the 'hood.

1492
01:15:41,687 --> 01:15:44,565
There's a loud party upstairs
that's keeping me up.

1493
01:15:44,647 --> 01:15:46,797
Could you please send a unit?

1494
01:15:46,887 --> 01:15:48,878
Miss Peanly kept on hating on us.

1495
01:15:48,967 --> 01:15:51,640
We didn't even cane.
We kept on partying.

1496
01:15:51,727 --> 01:15:54,082
My uncle got drunk
and eventually passed out.

1497
01:15:54,167 --> 01:15:55,759
And look at Pops--

1498
01:15:55,847 --> 01:15:58,964
You know. he showed his ass
till the po-pos came.

1499
01:15:59,047 --> 01:16:03,086
- Open the door! Let's do this!
- Put down the b-b-b-b-barbecue.

1500
01:16:03,167 --> 01:16:04,885
But all they wanted
was some mone weed.

1501
01:16:04,967 --> 01:16:06,195
So we looked them up.

1502
01:16:06,287 --> 01:16:09,882
and I even kept
Day-Day's dumb ass occupied.

1503
01:16:09,967 --> 01:16:11,400
And a German shepherd mix!

1504
01:16:14,447 --> 01:16:16,881
That's till
my moms walked in on him.

1505
01:16:16,967 --> 01:16:20,164
And me. you know how a player do.

1506
01:16:20,247 --> 01:16:22,363
I convinced Donna
to bring her fine ass

1507
01:16:22,447 --> 01:16:23,846
back to the panty.

1508
01:16:23,927 --> 01:16:25,360
got her in my room.

1509
01:16:25,447 --> 01:16:27,483
slid the dresser
in fnont of the door.

1510
01:16:27,567 --> 01:16:30,081
and got myself
an early Christmas present.

1511
01:16:30,167 --> 01:16:32,078
You know!

1512
01:16:37,287 --> 01:16:39,357
I'll beat-box your ass!
