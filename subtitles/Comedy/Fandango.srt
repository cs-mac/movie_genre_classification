1
00:01:13,952 --> 00:01:16,216
Gardner, he's coming.

2
00:01:16,555 --> 00:01:18,182
Okay.

3
00:01:24,162 --> 00:01:26,187
Almost, darling.

4
00:01:27,432 --> 00:01:29,297
But not quite.

5
00:01:39,444 --> 00:01:42,106
-He's coming. He's coming.
-More ice! More ice!

6
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,010
-Okay. He's coming.
-Oh, okay.

7
00:01:47,386 --> 00:01:49,445
Hey, Phil.

8
00:01:49,755 --> 00:01:52,781
ls this the appropriate
wedding color, son? Black?

9
00:01:52,991 --> 00:01:54,583
lt's perfect.

10
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,594
Well, l guess when a Groover marries,
the world mourns.

11
00:01:58,764 --> 00:01:59,992
Hey!

12
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,901
Line up. Hey, hey! Line up, okay?

13
00:02:12,477 --> 00:02:13,774
All right, all right.

14
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,974
Turn the music down.
Turn the music down. Come on.

15
00:02:20,552 --> 00:02:22,986
Oh, God. Come on.

16
00:02:25,223 --> 00:02:28,624
Are you ready? Okay, here they come.

17
00:02:33,932 --> 00:02:36,867
Three, two, one.

18
00:02:37,035 --> 00:02:40,027
Surprise!

19
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,131
Mom. Dad.

20
00:02:44,309 --> 00:02:45,742
Hi, folks!

21
00:02:45,911 --> 00:02:48,675
-Son.
-We didn't mean to surprise you.

22
00:02:48,847 --> 00:02:51,372
We thought we'd see
where you've been living...

23
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:54,178
-...for the past four years.
-l'm glad you did.

24
00:02:59,324 --> 00:03:01,622
You remember Dorman.
My roommate Dorman?

25
00:03:01,793 --> 00:03:04,387
Yes, aren't you the young man
studying to be a--?

26
00:03:04,563 --> 00:03:05,825
A minister.

27
00:03:06,164 --> 00:03:08,029
Minister, that's what l thought.

28
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,397
And this is Lester Griffin,
the fifth Groover.

29
00:03:11,703 --> 00:03:14,866
He just graduated
summa cum laude in accounting.

30
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,031
Congratulations, Lester.

31
00:03:20,078 --> 00:03:23,411
Well, l.... l guess we'll see you
after boot camp...

32
00:03:23,582 --> 00:03:25,641
-...lieutenant.
-Yes, sir.

33
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:29,284
Well, we'll see you, son.

34
00:03:29,621 --> 00:03:30,952
-Bye, Mom.
-See you.

35
00:03:31,123 --> 00:03:32,613
Bye, Dad.

36
00:03:33,825 --> 00:03:36,225
-Gardner!
-What?

37
00:03:38,597 --> 00:03:41,589
-Good. l hate that part.
-That was my parents.

38
00:03:41,767 --> 00:03:44,930
So they're from New Jersey, Phil.
They've seen butts before.

39
00:03:45,103 --> 00:03:46,468
There he is!

40
00:03:46,805 --> 00:03:50,138
Sneaking in the back door!

41
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,911
Who's getting married, boy?

42
00:04:00,085 --> 00:04:01,985
Getting married.

43
00:04:02,154 --> 00:04:06,181
Where have you been? l promised Debbie
l'd have you in Dallas tomorrow night.

44
00:04:06,358 --> 00:04:08,417
You haven't packed. You're not dressed.

45
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,729
Speech!

46
00:04:16,902 --> 00:04:18,870
Speech!

47
00:04:26,411 --> 00:04:28,072
Quiet. Quiet.

48
00:04:33,185 --> 00:04:35,210
The wedding's off.

49
00:04:35,887 --> 00:04:38,151
Shut up! Damn it.

50
00:04:39,424 --> 00:04:42,154
Deb and l ain't getting married.
l'm calling it off.

51
00:04:48,099 --> 00:04:49,896
Waggener, that's great!

52
00:04:50,302 --> 00:04:53,601
Oh, son, when did you come
to your senses?

53
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,805
When l got this.

54
00:04:57,709 --> 00:04:59,802
l've been drafted, Gardner.

55
00:05:08,186 --> 00:05:09,881
Congratulations.

56
00:05:10,655 --> 00:05:12,714
We're saved.

57
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:15,088
The Groovers are saved!

58
00:05:16,094 --> 00:05:18,619
Hey. This has his orders on it.

59
00:05:19,331 --> 00:05:20,821
We got another one, colonel.

60
00:05:20,999 --> 00:05:23,092
Mine says the same thing,
except here...

61
00:05:23,268 --> 00:05:26,726
...where it goes, ''A review
of your 2-S student deferred status...

62
00:05:26,905 --> 00:05:30,534
...indicates three years without
achieving academic advancement.

63
00:05:30,709 --> 00:05:33,974
Therefore, you are hereby ordered
for induction.''

64
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:41,442
This mean l get my fondue set back?

65
00:05:41,653 --> 00:05:43,518
You dog!

66
00:05:46,825 --> 00:05:48,793
Yeah! Yeah!

67
00:05:51,062 --> 00:05:55,328
Philip! Philip!
Philip, give me your keys.

68
00:05:55,567 --> 00:05:56,795
We're going somewhere.

69
00:05:57,002 --> 00:06:00,096
-Who's going?
-We're going. Us.

70
00:06:00,272 --> 00:06:02,137
The Groovers. Now.

71
00:06:02,307 --> 00:06:04,707
What about your car?

72
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:08,508
You're drinking it. Come on. Dorman.

73
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,807
-All right!
-Dorman, get Lester.

74
00:06:10,982 --> 00:06:13,007
You sold your car to throw a party?

75
00:06:13,184 --> 00:06:15,311
But you didn't even graduate.

76
00:06:15,587 --> 00:06:20,991
-What is this?
-A farewell fandango for the Groovers!

77
00:06:23,161 --> 00:06:25,026
Turn out the lights when you leave.

78
00:06:25,196 --> 00:06:28,688
lnnocent critters squashed
on the highway of life!

79
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:43,457
Tough it out, son. Tough it out.

80
00:09:44,395 --> 00:09:47,296
Well, now, what do you
boys want for breakfast?

81
00:09:47,465 --> 00:09:48,932
Barbecue?

82
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:54,204
Okay, chili.

83
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,501
Drafted...

84
00:09:57,675 --> 00:09:59,108
...graduated...

85
00:09:59,277 --> 00:10:00,938
...disengaged.

86
00:10:01,412 --> 00:10:03,812
Guess y'all know what this means,
don't you?

87
00:10:04,582 --> 00:10:06,447
We got to dig up Dom.

88
00:10:16,261 --> 00:10:17,558
Open up, Philip.

89
00:10:18,296 --> 00:10:20,662
You're not taking my car to Mexico.

90
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,433
Well, Dom's not in Mexico, son.
He's on the border.

91
00:10:25,603 --> 00:10:27,161
l know where he is.

92
00:10:27,338 --> 00:10:32,071
Do you mean to tell me that you'd let Dom
stay buried out there for a century...

93
00:10:32,243 --> 00:10:35,178
...as a damn fossil
for some post-historic nerd to find?

94
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:39,441
No. l mean to tell you that we're not
driving 400 miles in my car...

95
00:10:39,617 --> 00:10:43,383
-...to go down there and dig him up.
-But you swore, son. We all did.

96
00:10:43,555 --> 00:10:44,988
Took a holy Groover oath.

97
00:10:45,156 --> 00:10:48,489
Come one, Phil, we're dog meat.
This could be our last chance.

98
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:54,121
He's right, Philip. We're facing combat
and questionable life spans.

99
00:10:54,299 --> 00:10:58,531
lt's not like we're going after some
nameless piece of trash alongside the road.

100
00:10:58,703 --> 00:11:01,604
No, sir. We're going after Dom, Philip.

101
00:11:01,773 --> 00:11:05,732
A dear bud we laid to rest
the very night the Groovers were born...

102
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:10,472
...is all l'm talking about.
Bonds and beers and the five of us, Philip.

103
00:11:10,648 --> 00:11:14,106
Driving down that long, lonesome highway.

104
00:11:14,953 --> 00:11:20,789
l'm talking about us reliving
the greatest chapter in Groover history.

105
00:11:21,259 --> 00:11:23,523
Don't that mean something to you?

106
00:11:28,199 --> 00:11:32,295
Look, we had our fling,
and it was fun, okay?

107
00:11:33,037 --> 00:11:36,871
But we gotta get to Dallas
by tomorrow night for his wedding.

108
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:41,574
Read my lips, Philip, okay?

109
00:11:41,746 --> 00:11:44,442
He's not getting married.

110
00:11:44,616 --> 00:11:46,516
He didn't back out yet.

111
00:11:47,185 --> 00:11:48,846
Did you?

112
00:11:57,528 --> 00:11:59,018
What'd she say?

113
00:12:00,932 --> 00:12:02,729
Nothing. She wasn't home.

114
00:12:03,001 --> 00:12:04,400
What?

115
00:12:05,403 --> 00:12:09,237
She was at a kitchen shower,
so l told her dad.

116
00:12:10,275 --> 00:12:14,177
You called off your wedding
after talking to her dad?

117
00:12:19,584 --> 00:12:23,680
Well, now that we got that out of the way,
can we get going?

118
00:12:23,855 --> 00:12:26,517
-Gardner, we gotta help him.
-Philip...

119
00:12:27,292 --> 00:12:29,726
...l'm just as concerned about this
as you are.

120
00:12:29,894 --> 00:12:32,658
l mean, l spent $ 1 8 for this tux.

121
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:35,856
But it's done, son.
lt wasn't meant to be.

122
00:12:36,434 --> 00:12:38,163
And Dom is waiting.

123
00:12:38,736 --> 00:12:40,033
Over, rover!

124
00:12:41,406 --> 00:12:43,340
Come on! Watch out!

125
00:12:43,508 --> 00:12:45,942
We have to report
to boot camp on Monday night.

126
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:50,137
-We'll be back tomorrow night.
-We were gone a week the first time.

127
00:12:50,348 --> 00:12:54,842
Flukes, Philip. Groovers got to expect
that kind of stuff every once in a while.

128
00:13:14,906 --> 00:13:18,501
Hey! How about margaritas
at Chata Ortega's?

129
00:13:18,676 --> 00:13:20,507
We can see the donkey lady.

130
00:13:20,678 --> 00:13:22,077
We could get diseases.

131
00:13:23,047 --> 00:13:26,744
l swear, Philip, l don't know
why we bring you along sometimes.

132
00:13:27,118 --> 00:13:29,279
My car, my money.

133
00:13:31,789 --> 00:13:34,519
Next time we stop,
maybe l can get out and call Deb.

134
00:13:34,692 --> 00:13:36,592
Just to sort of tell her in person.

135
00:13:37,628 --> 00:13:39,755
She's been told, Waggener.

136
00:13:40,331 --> 00:13:42,231
Just let it ride, son.

137
00:13:43,067 --> 00:13:44,500
Give it a few weeks.

138
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:47,201
Then write her.

139
00:13:52,176 --> 00:13:54,235
You ever have any regrets?

140
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,979
About what?

141
00:13:59,817 --> 00:14:01,284
Certain women.

142
00:14:04,622 --> 00:14:07,819
l never been serious about a woman
in my life, son.

143
00:14:07,992 --> 00:14:10,085
You know that.

144
00:14:45,229 --> 00:14:46,821
That's dirt, son.

145
00:14:46,998 --> 00:14:49,057
There's no highway through here.

146
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,561
Dotted line means dirt.

147
00:14:52,003 --> 00:14:54,267
l thought it meant shortcut.

148
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:56,800
Do you know what E means?

149
00:14:56,974 --> 00:14:58,441
Do you know what E means?

150
00:14:58,609 --> 00:15:00,941
lt means empty, douche bag.

151
00:15:01,112 --> 00:15:02,909
Like your head!

152
00:15:03,648 --> 00:15:07,516
Well, l guess l'm just not officer material.

153
00:15:07,885 --> 00:15:09,750
l guess not.

154
00:15:14,926 --> 00:15:16,894
Where are we?

155
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:21,960
The ass of nowhere.

156
00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:53,456
Give Lester a beer.

157
00:15:53,631 --> 00:15:57,567
-He doesn't need another beer.
-The boy's facing life as an accountant.

158
00:15:58,169 --> 00:15:59,534
He needs something.

159
00:16:00,071 --> 00:16:04,098
l can't believe l let you
talk me into this. This is stupid!

160
00:16:04,408 --> 00:16:07,605
lt's the stuff legends are made of, son.

161
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,840
What time's the wedding?

162
00:16:29,867 --> 00:16:32,802
Texas is really ugly, you know that?

163
00:16:33,337 --> 00:16:38,536
l mean, what could anyone
possibly like about this state?

164
00:16:38,709 --> 00:16:40,609
l like the way it's shaped.

165
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,906
lt's wild, Philip.

166
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:46,675
Always has been, always will be.

167
00:16:47,351 --> 00:16:48,875
Just like us.

168
00:17:26,424 --> 00:17:29,723
Can you imagine coming all the way
out here just to get killed?

169
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,699
You having second thoughts?

170
00:17:37,001 --> 00:17:39,731
Yeah, l believe l burned all my bridges.

171
00:17:39,904 --> 00:17:45,206
Well, buck up, bud, because l think
you did the right thing.

172
00:17:45,643 --> 00:17:48,043
That's what her father said on the phone.

173
00:17:48,346 --> 00:17:51,941
''You're doing the right thing, Kenneth.
l'm behind you all the way.''

174
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:54,745
Always been in front of me till then.

175
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:57,713
Waggener, she's history, all right?
She's history.

176
00:17:57,888 --> 00:18:02,188
The only way to get over a woman,
unfortunately, is get yourself another one.

177
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,056
So when Dom's dug up
and our duty's done...

178
00:18:05,229 --> 00:18:08,858
...you and me, we're gonna slide
into Chata Ortega's...

179
00:18:09,033 --> 00:18:12,799
...and destroy a few brain cells
and hunt up some horn-dog women--

180
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:15,598
The guy's rich.
He could have made some calls.

181
00:18:15,806 --> 00:18:17,706
Why should he?

182
00:18:18,943 --> 00:18:20,808
lt's your duty.

183
00:18:21,345 --> 00:18:23,245
Well, l'm proud to be going.

184
00:18:25,216 --> 00:18:26,706
l am.

185
00:18:27,084 --> 00:18:28,745
Aren't we all?

186
00:18:36,193 --> 00:18:38,320
That's a train, boys!

187
00:18:46,771 --> 00:18:49,205
You! Off the car!

188
00:18:50,941 --> 00:18:53,307
Get off my car.

189
00:18:56,247 --> 00:18:58,340
-Come on. We can hop it.
-What?

190
00:18:58,516 --> 00:19:00,814
Nothing's come down that road
for two hours.

191
00:19:00,985 --> 00:19:03,783
-What about my car?
-We'll pick it up on the way back.

192
00:19:03,954 --> 00:19:06,218
Forget it. l know you.

193
00:19:12,997 --> 00:19:15,625
Look, Philip, this might be
the only ride we get.

194
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:20,533
We're not leaving my car,
and that's final.

195
00:19:24,508 --> 00:19:26,476
Gardner, talk to me.
Talk to me.

196
00:19:26,644 --> 00:19:28,578
l may have vapor lock on my brain...

197
00:19:28,746 --> 00:19:32,546
...but l just need to know,
are you crazy?

198
00:19:32,717 --> 00:19:34,844
Are you out of your mind?

199
00:19:35,019 --> 00:19:36,646
lt'll work, Philip.

200
00:19:42,893 --> 00:19:46,021
You think this is a wise move?
Wait. l mean, it's a train.

201
00:19:46,197 --> 00:19:49,428
Think! Think! Don't be big and stupid.

202
00:19:50,234 --> 00:19:53,795
Come on. Gardner, Gardner,
show some sense.

203
00:19:54,739 --> 00:19:57,503
Oh, great. Great.

204
00:20:00,277 --> 00:20:02,268
Yeah, Dorman!

205
00:20:02,913 --> 00:20:04,938
Get the wheels straight.

206
00:20:06,283 --> 00:20:07,910
That's a felony, you know that?

207
00:20:08,085 --> 00:20:09,416
Yes.

208
00:20:14,325 --> 00:20:16,793
We're all gonna die!

209
00:20:20,865 --> 00:20:24,062
Didn't you hear me?
l said we're facing imminent death.

210
00:20:24,235 --> 00:20:26,499
lt'll be just like water-skiing, Philip.

211
00:20:27,104 --> 00:20:28,503
Water-skiing?

212
00:20:28,672 --> 00:20:30,037
Get in.

213
00:20:44,855 --> 00:20:47,289
He did it. Run, son.

214
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:48,755
-Brake off?
-Yep.

215
00:20:48,959 --> 00:20:50,756
-Neutral?
-Check.

216
00:20:50,928 --> 00:20:52,156
l don't believe this!

217
00:20:52,329 --> 00:20:54,126
lt'll work, Philip.

218
00:20:59,603 --> 00:21:01,366
Dorman, run!

219
00:21:02,973 --> 00:21:04,406
Hurry!

220
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:09,941
Do you know how many pizzas
l had to make to buy this car?

221
00:21:12,183 --> 00:21:13,445
Hey.

222
00:21:14,018 --> 00:21:15,713
How are we gonna stop?

223
00:22:13,377 --> 00:22:16,141
First phone we get to, l'm calling the police.

224
00:22:17,848 --> 00:22:22,148
Philip, can't let a little thing like this
stop the damn pilgrimage.

225
00:22:23,354 --> 00:22:26,289
Sorry. We're getting off here.

226
00:22:43,941 --> 00:22:45,533
That car's afflicted.

227
00:22:45,709 --> 00:22:48,405
No, it just needs a little alignment hygiene.

228
00:22:50,014 --> 00:22:52,039
Well, l hope y'all ain't in no hurry.

229
00:22:52,216 --> 00:22:54,275
l can't fix it till in the morning.

230
00:22:54,451 --> 00:22:55,679
How come?

231
00:22:55,853 --> 00:22:59,220
Because it's Saturday night.
My mechanic's gone honky-tonking.

232
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:01,449
My tools is in his truck.

233
00:23:02,826 --> 00:23:04,726
Sorry, boys.

234
00:23:04,895 --> 00:23:07,523
A night in Marfa ain't so bad.

235
00:23:08,198 --> 00:23:10,428
Motel's over there.

236
00:23:11,602 --> 00:23:13,934
lf you're looking for cheaper bunks...

237
00:23:14,271 --> 00:23:16,705
...there's a roadside park
just up the highway.

238
00:23:17,007 --> 00:23:19,999
Out by the old movie set
where they shot Giant.

239
00:23:20,444 --> 00:23:21,672
James Dean was here?

240
00:23:21,946 --> 00:23:23,504
Yeah.

241
00:23:23,681 --> 00:23:26,343
1 955.

242
00:23:27,084 --> 00:23:30,713
Listen, front-end alignment
will run you 1 1 .95.

243
00:23:32,289 --> 00:23:34,382
Want me to do anything about that?

244
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,394
Yeah, if it's free.

245
00:23:39,964 --> 00:23:42,762
l'll get you out of here
early as l can tomorrow.

246
00:23:42,933 --> 00:23:45,163
Better hurry if you want supper.

247
00:23:45,536 --> 00:23:48,232
Dairy Queen closes at 8.

248
00:23:52,109 --> 00:23:57,069
-May l take your order, please?
-Give me three chili dogs and a malt.

249
00:25:16,727 --> 00:25:18,661
This is what we've been waiting for.

250
00:25:18,829 --> 00:25:21,696
-lt's not the same, Gardner.
-What's not?

251
00:25:21,865 --> 00:25:23,594
They're jailbait.

252
00:25:23,934 --> 00:25:26,095
Well, that never stopped us before.

253
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:28,738
We were jailbait before.

254
00:25:31,275 --> 00:25:33,175
They're airheads, Gardner.

255
00:25:33,343 --> 00:25:36,540
Bimbos. Little girls with little brains.

256
00:25:36,713 --> 00:25:40,706
But we're not trying to expand their
minds, so don't get picky on me.

257
00:25:40,918 --> 00:25:44,979
And so then, right after she had the baby...

258
00:25:45,155 --> 00:25:48,022
...they had to remove her utopian tubes.

259
00:25:48,192 --> 00:25:50,922
No. No. That's ''fallopian,'' darling.

260
00:25:51,095 --> 00:25:55,498
Fallopian? Those are books
of the Bible, silly.

261
00:25:55,666 --> 00:25:58,191
First and Second Fallopians.

262
00:26:00,003 --> 00:26:02,403
So, what do you all want to do now?

263
00:26:02,573 --> 00:26:07,203
-Are you 1 8?
-l know, let's shoot fireworks.

264
00:26:09,079 --> 00:26:11,411
That is so neat.

265
00:26:11,582 --> 00:26:15,074
-Would y'all like to do that, huh?
-Only if it's neat.

266
00:26:15,252 --> 00:26:18,619
We got tons of bottle rockets
left over from Christmas.

267
00:26:18,789 --> 00:26:20,984
We just gonna pull off the road or what?

268
00:26:21,692 --> 00:26:25,355
No, l think we'll go to my daddy's place.

269
00:26:30,267 --> 00:26:34,101
Just what exactly
does your daddy do, Lorna, darling?

270
00:26:34,271 --> 00:26:36,068
He's in the funeral business.

271
00:26:39,042 --> 00:26:40,942
This is his cemetery.

272
00:26:43,046 --> 00:26:44,536
Come on, y'all.

273
00:26:44,715 --> 00:26:45,977
Come on.

274
00:26:52,656 --> 00:26:55,352
Come on. You'll get used to it.

275
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:06,200
Can't we just find
a playground or something?

276
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:10,470
This has been my playground
ever since l can remember.

277
00:27:13,243 --> 00:27:14,574
See?

278
00:27:14,745 --> 00:27:16,679
Lots of places to hide.

279
00:27:17,681 --> 00:27:21,173
-l ain't gonna ask what we're hiding from.
-From each other.

280
00:27:21,351 --> 00:27:23,251
No fun shooting them off in the air.

281
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:27,015
-You gotta have moving targets.
-Ain't that just a tad dangerous?

282
00:27:27,191 --> 00:27:29,455
No. lt's so neat.

283
00:27:29,626 --> 00:27:35,121
-We'll choose up sides.
-Okay. Me and Waggener and Phil.

284
00:27:35,365 --> 00:27:39,096
Y'all take the Garden of the Good
Shepherd and the Garden of Bliss.

285
00:27:39,269 --> 00:27:41,669
We'll count to 1 00,
then we'll come after you.

286
00:27:41,838 --> 00:27:44,466
No aiming for the face. And be real careful.

287
00:27:44,641 --> 00:27:46,734
These could go off
and hurt somebody.

288
00:27:55,252 --> 00:27:56,719
We started!

289
00:27:56,887 --> 00:27:59,185
-Gardner.
-Gardner!

290
00:28:01,458 --> 00:28:03,483
Get Phil!

291
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:04,991
Get him!

292
00:28:28,085 --> 00:28:30,918
l'm okay. Come on. God!

293
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,998
Y'all watch out for those new graves.

294
00:28:42,165 --> 00:28:44,360
They're not packed down yet.

295
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:49,138
These stiffs got no manners at all.

296
00:29:04,254 --> 00:29:05,812
Sorry, friend.

297
00:29:28,312 --> 00:29:30,712
l'm not sure l can do it, Gardner.

298
00:29:32,382 --> 00:29:34,475
l'm not sure l can go.

299
00:29:34,651 --> 00:29:36,084
Then don't.

300
00:30:07,584 --> 00:30:10,212
lt's not quite what l expected.

301
00:30:10,854 --> 00:30:13,448
They shot Giant here?

302
00:30:14,691 --> 00:30:16,090
Can you imagine?

303
00:30:16,259 --> 00:30:19,353
James Dean walking around
right out here.

304
00:30:24,134 --> 00:30:26,967
Pass me the classifieds there,
would you, bud?

305
00:30:27,437 --> 00:30:29,837
All that ink's bound to be warm.

306
00:30:30,006 --> 00:30:33,066
Great. This is the worst.

307
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:36,005
This is the worst ever.

308
00:30:37,013 --> 00:30:39,447
Now, if it would just rain....

309
00:30:43,854 --> 00:30:45,754
See that star?

310
00:30:46,323 --> 00:30:48,291
Off that peak?

311
00:30:48,859 --> 00:30:50,827
That was our star.

312
00:30:51,762 --> 00:30:53,286
Me and Deb.

313
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:55,795
To talk to when we were apart.

314
00:30:55,966 --> 00:30:57,433
Quit it.

315
00:31:01,004 --> 00:31:03,165
l wonder if the night's
like this in Nam.

316
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:05,570
You'll find out soon enough.

317
00:31:06,476 --> 00:31:08,910
Looking forward to it,
ain't you, Philip?

318
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,213
To serving my country?

319
00:31:11,648 --> 00:31:13,172
Yeah. l am.

320
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:16,478
There are other countries,
you know?

321
00:31:16,653 --> 00:31:17,915
What?

322
00:31:18,655 --> 00:31:20,452
There's Canada.

323
00:31:23,693 --> 00:31:27,459
You are the most irresponsible person
l have ever met.

324
00:31:28,498 --> 00:31:32,730
Well, somebody had to be.

325
00:33:10,567 --> 00:33:12,933
Snake! Snake!

326
00:33:14,004 --> 00:33:15,767
Snake. lt's in my pants.

327
00:33:15,939 --> 00:33:17,429
Don't rile him up, Philip.

328
00:33:17,908 --> 00:33:20,468
Damn. lt's a snake.

329
00:33:22,913 --> 00:33:24,642
-What kind is it?
-lt's a rattler.

330
00:33:26,983 --> 00:33:28,314
lt's moving! lt's moving.

331
00:33:40,764 --> 00:33:42,755
A lizard.

332
00:33:43,733 --> 00:33:48,295
-lt felt like a snake.
-No, no. lt felt like a rattler.

333
00:33:48,471 --> 00:33:50,962
God, l was having a nightmare.

334
00:33:51,141 --> 00:33:53,200
Well, get used to them.

335
00:33:54,411 --> 00:33:59,576
Twenty, 21 , 22, 23 and 50.

336
00:33:59,749 --> 00:34:01,580
And 5 for the go juice.

337
00:34:01,751 --> 00:34:05,687
And much obliged for that body job.
That is first-rate work.

338
00:34:09,326 --> 00:34:14,730
The other way, bud. Remember,
it's lefty loosey, righty tighty.

339
00:34:34,985 --> 00:34:37,749
Another hundred miles
and we're there, boys.

340
00:34:37,921 --> 00:34:39,912
Dom. Ortega's.

341
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:43,116
-How about some breakfast?
-Where'd you get the money?

342
00:34:43,293 --> 00:34:46,319
-Birthday present from the girls.
-lt's not your birthday.

343
00:34:46,496 --> 00:34:49,363
-Well, it's gonna be.
-You stole that money.

344
00:34:49,532 --> 00:34:52,126
Just like you stole my car.

345
00:34:52,636 --> 00:34:54,695
What is your problem?

346
00:34:54,871 --> 00:34:57,135
Here we are,
embarked on what is probably...

347
00:34:57,307 --> 00:35:00,299
...the greatest epic adventure of all time,
and all--

348
00:35:00,477 --> 00:35:04,106
Nobody cares about
epic adventures anymore.

349
00:35:07,684 --> 00:35:09,311
Philip, we....

350
00:35:10,387 --> 00:35:14,687
We came out here to try
and forget some things. All right?

351
00:35:15,191 --> 00:35:16,749
So why won't you let us?

352
00:35:18,395 --> 00:35:21,193
There's nothing wrong
with going nowhere, son.

353
00:35:21,364 --> 00:35:26,392
-lt's a privilege of youth.
-Well, we're not youths anymore, Peter Pan.

354
00:35:26,569 --> 00:35:29,003
You're only 1 8 once.

355
00:35:29,172 --> 00:35:32,835
Like you're only a virgin once,
and then it's over.

356
00:35:33,543 --> 00:35:35,909
Like the Groovers.

357
00:35:36,613 --> 00:35:39,104
l sort of like to think of us
as an institution.

358
00:35:39,282 --> 00:35:40,510
Over!

359
00:35:44,187 --> 00:35:48,283
You know, someday, Philip,
when you're old....

360
00:35:54,864 --> 00:35:56,388
Hey.

361
00:35:56,833 --> 00:35:59,529
Hey, where you going?
l'm not even rinsed off.

362
00:35:59,703 --> 00:36:02,672
-No more quarters.
-God!

363
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:06,607
l think you're trash, Gardner.

364
00:36:06,776 --> 00:36:08,744
l think you're slime.

365
00:36:08,912 --> 00:36:13,508
Selfish, worthless, irresponsible slime.

366
00:36:13,683 --> 00:36:15,583
What do you think about that?!

367
00:36:16,653 --> 00:36:19,247
l think freedom of expression's
a wonderful thing.

368
00:36:19,422 --> 00:36:22,687
Turn my car around now!

369
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,590
You're a bullshit artist.

370
00:36:26,763 --> 00:36:28,253
That's all you'll ever be...

371
00:36:28,431 --> 00:36:32,333
...because when life gets too complicated,
you just take off, run away.

372
00:36:32,502 --> 00:36:35,062
Well, make the most of this one, asshole.

373
00:36:35,238 --> 00:36:37,638
Because it's the last time
you push me around.

374
00:36:37,807 --> 00:36:41,299
Find some other jerk
and go chasing after rainbows and--

375
00:36:41,478 --> 00:36:44,879
Will you shut up? Just shut up!
God, l'm sick of your mouth.

376
00:36:45,048 --> 00:36:47,983
Nobody made you come,
you pompous, little whiner.

377
00:36:48,151 --> 00:36:51,814
Just like nobody made you room with us
for four years. You wanted to.

378
00:36:51,988 --> 00:36:56,482
But it's always bitch, bitch, bitch.
About Dom or dinner or whatever.

379
00:36:56,659 --> 00:36:59,389
That's all you're good at.
l'm sick of hearing it.

380
00:36:59,562 --> 00:37:02,326
You're a pain in the ass
who doesn't like anything.

381
00:37:02,499 --> 00:37:06,902
So either kill yourself and do us all a favor,
or shut the hell up!

382
00:37:16,579 --> 00:37:18,740
l guess l should have expected as much...

383
00:37:18,915 --> 00:37:22,214
...from a guy who chickens out
on his own wedding.

384
00:37:22,385 --> 00:37:24,148
That's right...

385
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,685
...coward.

386
00:37:25,855 --> 00:37:27,720
lt wasn't the draft.

387
00:37:27,891 --> 00:37:29,722
lt wasn't her parents.

388
00:37:30,293 --> 00:37:34,195
You just got scared and ran off like him.

389
00:37:34,664 --> 00:37:38,725
And now you're down here
pretending all this crap is still fun.

390
00:37:38,902 --> 00:37:42,394
Afraid to admit she was the best thing
that ever happened to you...

391
00:37:42,572 --> 00:37:46,440
...because deep down inside,
you know you blew it.

392
00:37:46,609 --> 00:37:49,271
You little wimp, l had to!
Don't tell me--

393
00:37:49,445 --> 00:37:50,935
-Take the wheel.
-Bastard!

394
00:37:51,114 --> 00:37:53,082
Goddamn it!

395
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:55,474
Philip!

396
00:37:56,152 --> 00:37:58,382
-Stop it.
-Quit it!

397
00:37:58,555 --> 00:38:00,113
Quit it.

398
00:38:01,391 --> 00:38:02,915
That's it, Philip.

399
00:38:03,092 --> 00:38:05,856
Now, that's it. You win.

400
00:38:07,831 --> 00:38:09,526
We're going home.

401
00:38:10,533 --> 00:38:12,467
Thanks to you,
Dom don't mean shit.

402
00:38:12,635 --> 00:38:14,967
Dom never meant shit.

403
00:38:15,138 --> 00:38:18,835
You know, Philip, you talk tough.
You act tough.

404
00:38:19,008 --> 00:38:21,408
You march a bunch of weenies
around a field...

405
00:38:21,578 --> 00:38:25,514
...but the fact of the matter is, son,
you are an ROTC colonel...

406
00:38:26,449 --> 00:38:28,815
...because that's all you ever could be.

407
00:38:30,053 --> 00:38:32,078
And now look at you.

408
00:38:32,255 --> 00:38:34,280
Anxious to get yourself martyred...

409
00:38:34,457 --> 00:38:36,948
...hoping somebody's
gonna love you for it.

410
00:38:37,627 --> 00:38:39,356
You're pathetic, Philip.

411
00:38:39,529 --> 00:38:42,327
l don't know how else to say it.
You're just pathetic.

412
00:38:42,498 --> 00:38:47,629
And that is the only reason any of us
ever had anything to do with you.

413
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:52,137
We never really liked you, son.

414
00:38:53,042 --> 00:38:55,567
We just felt sorry for you.

415
00:38:57,347 --> 00:38:59,713
l'm-- l'm not a weenie.

416
00:39:00,617 --> 00:39:02,881
Dorman, turn us around.

417
00:39:03,152 --> 00:39:07,418
We got to get this little weenie
back to his stupid little, worthless war.

418
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:09,683
Now you listen to me!

419
00:39:10,526 --> 00:39:13,689
Not everyone gets a college education
just handed to them.

420
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:18,226
That uniform is my ticket
to some kind of a future.

421
00:39:19,335 --> 00:39:20,962
l'm giving my notice right now.

422
00:39:21,137 --> 00:39:25,073
l'll take on anybody, anything,
anywhere, anytime--

423
00:39:55,705 --> 00:39:57,570
Well, Philip.

424
00:39:59,642 --> 00:40:01,234
Okay.

425
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:43,706
l'd have done it if we had the money.

426
00:41:54,891 --> 00:41:57,359
You looking for something?

427
00:41:58,261 --> 00:41:59,785
Yes, l am.

428
00:42:02,131 --> 00:42:04,463
l'm looking for the head jumping bean.

429
00:42:29,392 --> 00:42:31,087
Some guys are looking for you.

430
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:39,825
Good morning.
Quite a day for jumping, isn't it?

431
00:42:40,002 --> 00:42:42,869
Gardner Barnes. Your name, sir?

432
00:42:44,307 --> 00:42:48,175
-Truman Sparks.
-Well, it's nice to meet you, Truman.

433
00:42:48,344 --> 00:42:50,744
Your wife tells me you're in charge here.

434
00:42:51,047 --> 00:42:56,110
Oh, no. She ain't my wife.
Trelis is just my old lady, you know?

435
00:42:56,285 --> 00:42:59,379
Yeah. Truman, you ever heard
of the Milwaukee Daily Moon?

436
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:05,254
We're on the travel and entertainment
staff of that illustrious newspaper...

437
00:43:05,428 --> 00:43:07,794
...and we're in the midst
of a research tour.

438
00:43:07,964 --> 00:43:12,025
Our action-adventure editor, Mr. Hicks,
wants to take a jump course today...

439
00:43:12,201 --> 00:43:16,001
...so he can accurately depict the delights
of skydiving in his column.

440
00:43:16,172 --> 00:43:18,766
Hey, far out.
He wants to do that today?

441
00:43:18,941 --> 00:43:21,808
-He wants to do it right now.
-This will be in a paper?

442
00:43:21,978 --> 00:43:24,242
We're talking big dollars. Big dollars.

443
00:43:24,413 --> 00:43:28,611
ln fact, you think any of this land
could be available for resort development?

444
00:43:29,051 --> 00:43:31,246
-Resort?
-Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

445
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:34,981
Lot of potential. Lot of potential.

446
00:43:37,293 --> 00:43:40,694
Since this series will be a free godsend
to the local economy...

447
00:43:40,863 --> 00:43:46,358
...we were hoping maybe that you could
reciprocate a little on the lesson.

448
00:43:47,503 --> 00:43:49,061
Truman.

449
00:43:49,372 --> 00:43:52,466
-On the lesson.
-No problem. We'll work something out.

450
00:43:52,642 --> 00:43:54,701
Not gonna be a problem?
Let's get to it.

451
00:43:54,877 --> 00:43:56,572
-Okay, Mr. Barnes.
-Out you go!

452
00:44:06,455 --> 00:44:09,185
Okay, field marshal, let's go.

453
00:44:10,893 --> 00:44:15,626
-He's scared of heights, remember?
-Well, most weenies are.

454
00:44:26,809 --> 00:44:30,472
-Hey, pretty excited, isn't he?
-The man absolutely thrives on danger.

455
00:44:30,646 --> 00:44:33,877
We need to counsel with him
about his editorial approach...

456
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:38,578
...so you go inside, get things strung up.
We'll be in right after you, okay?

457
00:44:38,754 --> 00:44:40,483
Okay.

458
00:44:41,224 --> 00:44:43,089
Let him up, Dorman.

459
00:44:43,993 --> 00:44:47,690
Pretty mean, aren't you, Phil?
Pretty mean character.

460
00:44:48,264 --> 00:44:50,164
Well, prove it.

461
00:44:51,767 --> 00:44:52,995
All right, l will.

462
00:44:54,971 --> 00:44:56,962
-On one condition.
-Anything you say.

463
00:44:57,139 --> 00:45:00,666
No, you've got to swear it,
in case l'm not here.

464
00:45:00,843 --> 00:45:03,175
-Consider it sworn.
-Me too.

465
00:45:03,512 --> 00:45:05,446
lf l do this...

466
00:45:05,615 --> 00:45:08,516
...you got to swear
you won't dodge the draft.

467
00:45:11,787 --> 00:45:14,915
-l don't know what you're talking about.
-You gotta swear...

468
00:45:15,091 --> 00:45:17,616
...you won't skip off to Mexico with him!

469
00:45:23,966 --> 00:45:25,593
Okay.

470
00:45:41,417 --> 00:45:43,908
l know you better than you think.

471
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:00,533
-Let's do it.
-Hey, real gung ho, huh?

472
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:04,696
-He can't wait to get started.
-Come on in, sign a release, and we'll go.

473
00:46:04,874 --> 00:46:08,435
-A release?
-Saying you won't sue me if you get killed.

474
00:46:08,611 --> 00:46:10,272
What?

475
00:46:18,721 --> 00:46:23,317
Okay, you'll be coming out here and doing
a stable fall facedown, frog modified.

476
00:46:23,492 --> 00:46:26,757
Out here comes the static line.
lt goes from this to here.

477
00:46:26,929 --> 00:46:32,060
The pilot chute opens, pulling the bridle out,
and then the main canopy will be open.

478
00:46:32,234 --> 00:46:36,227
And then you'll be down here,
looking up here for the WDl indicator.

479
00:46:36,405 --> 00:46:38,566
And you'll also check for Mae West.

480
00:46:38,741 --> 00:46:42,575
lf that's not there, you need to check here
for four panels and a hole.

481
00:46:42,745 --> 00:46:47,739
When you come down, you'll find the P,
you'll land here and get in this position.

482
00:46:47,917 --> 00:46:50,351
Except you don't wanna do that.
That's trouble.

483
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:54,751
What you want to do is get right here,
come around here, fold up...

484
00:46:54,924 --> 00:46:58,826
...and do a toggle and jettison,
and always watch the horizon, okay?

485
00:47:10,239 --> 00:47:12,503
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

486
00:47:13,609 --> 00:47:15,975
No. Hold it.
You screwed up again, man.

487
00:47:18,514 --> 00:47:20,846
You gotta stay clear
of this static line...

488
00:47:21,016 --> 00:47:23,314
...or you're gonna get
your head tore off.

489
00:47:23,486 --> 00:47:28,788
This time, go ahead and jump off the strut
and arch back onto this mattress.

490
00:47:31,026 --> 00:47:34,928
A good, hard arch. Okay?
Let's do it one more time like l showed you.

491
00:47:35,097 --> 00:47:40,125
You're inside the plane. l cut the engine.
You reach your hands outside the door.

492
00:47:40,302 --> 00:47:43,999
Step out on the wheel,
dangle a foot and arch!

493
00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:57,710
Wow, he missed the mattress.

494
00:48:04,493 --> 00:48:08,190
You guys might wanna help him
adjust the straps a little.

495
00:48:10,433 --> 00:48:13,891
The chances of having a malfunction
are one in 1 000, Mr. Hicks.

496
00:48:14,069 --> 00:48:15,661
lt's only, like, one in 1 000.

497
00:48:15,838 --> 00:48:18,204
l don't even want you worrying about it.

498
00:48:18,374 --> 00:48:22,834
l used to rig chutes in Nam, man.
And l repack these babies every week.

499
00:48:23,012 --> 00:48:25,981
So if something goes wrong
with your main chute...

500
00:48:26,148 --> 00:48:30,983
...you still got the old belly reserve here.
You get two shots at that mother, right?

501
00:48:31,153 --> 00:48:33,519
We're gonna go through it
like l showed you.

502
00:48:33,689 --> 00:48:36,954
Now, you're out on the wing,
and you're looking at me.

503
00:48:37,126 --> 00:48:41,620
Come on. You're looking at me,
and l give you the signal to go!

504
00:48:41,797 --> 00:48:45,961
Now you're arching and counting.
lt's 1 001 , 1 002. There's nothing happening!

505
00:48:46,135 --> 00:48:50,629
When you get to six, you look up over
your shoulder. lt's a screamer! Cut away!

506
00:48:50,806 --> 00:48:52,967
Pull the D rings! Oh, God! Oh, shit!

507
00:48:53,142 --> 00:48:56,805
You're gonna burn in. Tuck and cover!
Tuck and cover! Hit the reserve!

508
00:48:56,979 --> 00:48:59,709
Look out! You're gonna burn in, man.
Come on!

509
00:48:59,882 --> 00:49:02,248
Look out! Here comes the ground!
Let it go.

510
00:49:08,691 --> 00:49:10,352
You gotta be cool, dude.

511
00:49:10,526 --> 00:49:13,051
Do that in the real thing,
and you'll bounce.

512
00:49:13,496 --> 00:49:14,793
Bounce?

513
00:49:14,964 --> 00:49:18,957
Yeah, when somebody makes the big drop,
they don't really spatter.

514
00:49:19,134 --> 00:49:21,762
They just kind of bounce,
like, about 1 0 feet.

515
00:49:21,937 --> 00:49:25,395
Around here, you don't,
because the landing zone's real soft.

516
00:49:25,574 --> 00:49:29,340
Although l know one case where
a guy left a crater like a meteorite.

517
00:49:29,512 --> 00:49:32,003
Did he burn when he entered
the atmosphere?

518
00:49:32,181 --> 00:49:35,241
-No. l don't think so.
-Okay. He's got this down.

519
00:49:35,417 --> 00:49:38,875
-Are we ready to suit him up?
-Oh, sure thing, Mr. Barnes.

520
00:49:51,867 --> 00:49:53,858
Test one.

521
00:49:54,403 --> 00:49:55,802
Test two.

522
00:49:55,971 --> 00:50:00,067
Okay, you're all set, man.
l'll be talking you down on this thing.

523
00:50:00,242 --> 00:50:02,369
ls something the matter, dude?

524
00:50:02,545 --> 00:50:07,812
Look, if it'll make it easier, l'll jump first
so as you can watch how it's done.

525
00:50:17,927 --> 00:50:22,125
Oh, God.
What a space cadet l am, huh?

526
00:50:22,731 --> 00:50:24,665
Well, l can't do that.

527
00:50:24,833 --> 00:50:28,234
lf l do that,
who's gonna land the plane?

528
00:50:28,404 --> 00:50:30,429
Oh, God.

529
00:50:30,606 --> 00:50:33,404
That was a joke, son.
lt was a bad joke.

530
00:50:39,515 --> 00:50:41,540
There she is.

531
00:50:45,387 --> 00:50:46,979
What a beaut.

532
00:50:48,057 --> 00:50:51,959
-l painted her myself.
-Slow year, huh?

533
00:50:53,228 --> 00:50:56,220
-Looks fast, Truman.
-Yeah. lt's the stripes.

534
00:50:56,398 --> 00:51:00,528
-Yeah. Well, l like those.
-Trelis painted those.

535
00:51:00,703 --> 00:51:04,139
She's real talented.
Watch your heads, now.

536
00:51:08,544 --> 00:51:10,512
We don't need that.

537
00:51:10,779 --> 00:51:14,340
Oh, hi, Hazel.
No flight today.

538
00:51:32,234 --> 00:51:36,500
Oh, say, Truman, l ain't sure,
but l think l just hurt your plane.

539
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:46,074
Oh, no, man. Don't worry.
That thing's coming off all the time.

540
00:51:46,248 --> 00:51:51,276
l'm always meaning to fix this thing.
l just never have the time, you know?

541
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:54,612
There we go.
That baby's as good as new.

542
00:51:54,957 --> 00:51:56,584
Mr. Hicks!

543
00:51:56,759 --> 00:52:00,160
-Oh, here he is.
-There he is.

544
00:52:00,329 --> 00:52:03,492
-You all set?
-Oh, he's raring to go.

545
00:52:06,301 --> 00:52:09,168
How come you guys
ain't writing any of this stuff down?

546
00:52:09,672 --> 00:52:12,004
That's a good point, Truman.

547
00:52:23,452 --> 00:52:25,977
You take good notes, Philip.

548
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:33,188
Hop in, dude.

549
00:52:55,350 --> 00:52:59,013
That's one small step
for a Groover, boys...

550
00:52:59,188 --> 00:53:02,885
...one giant leap for weenie-kind!

551
00:53:42,131 --> 00:53:44,622
There he is, boys!

552
00:53:48,937 --> 00:53:51,337
l think he's really gonna do it.

553
00:53:53,709 --> 00:53:55,199
Ain't this fine?

554
00:53:55,377 --> 00:53:57,072
Vicarious entertainment...

555
00:53:57,246 --> 00:53:59,840
...courtesy of Phil Hicks,
weenie extraordinaire.

556
00:54:00,015 --> 00:54:03,781
-Oh, that Phil. He's something.
-Hey!

557
00:54:04,486 --> 00:54:07,944
Which one of you geeks
grabbed the wrong chute?

558
00:54:08,123 --> 00:54:09,454
Who's got my laundry?

559
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:20,725
l guess you do this kind of stuff
all the time...

560
00:54:20,903 --> 00:54:23,701
...being an action-adventure editor
and all.

561
00:54:24,206 --> 00:54:27,073
Hey, did you ever spearfish
for sharks, man?

562
00:54:27,242 --> 00:54:30,939
Must be a real rush, huh?
Just you and a great white, one-on-one.

563
00:54:31,113 --> 00:54:34,446
-He doesn't have a radio on the plane?
-He never needed one.

564
00:54:34,616 --> 00:54:35,913
That's against the law.

565
00:54:36,084 --> 00:54:41,454
Trelis, honey, listen to me. You don't
understand. We got to get him down.

566
00:54:41,857 --> 00:54:43,620
We gotta stop him, Trelis.

567
00:54:43,792 --> 00:54:49,128
Quit worrying. He's got one good chute
and my laundry.

568
00:54:49,331 --> 00:54:51,595
Think he'll remember
that emergency stuff?

569
00:54:51,767 --> 00:54:54,759
-Would you?
-Oh, God almighty. We gotta stop him.

570
00:54:54,937 --> 00:54:57,667
We gotta stop him.
We gotta send him a signal.

571
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:00,138
-How, smoke signals?
-Burn his car.

572
00:55:00,309 --> 00:55:03,437
No, no! Something else.
Something else.

573
00:55:03,612 --> 00:55:06,012
l got it! l got it.

574
00:55:06,515 --> 00:55:09,882
-We'll spell ''don't jump'' on the ground.
-With what?

575
00:55:15,324 --> 00:55:18,521
Hey, you don't mind if l fire up, do you?

576
00:55:20,629 --> 00:55:24,292
You might wanna take a couple of hits
before you go out the door.

577
00:55:24,933 --> 00:55:27,766
lt makes the trip down real interesting.

578
00:56:02,004 --> 00:56:05,303
Quick, son.
We need you to be an apostrophe.

579
00:56:07,042 --> 00:56:09,442
No, no! lt's not gonna work!

580
00:56:09,611 --> 00:56:12,102
lt's too small.
He's not gonna understand it.

581
00:56:12,281 --> 00:56:15,409
-We're out of clothes.
-Come on, Gardner, think!

582
00:56:29,398 --> 00:56:30,695
Come here, boys!

583
00:56:30,866 --> 00:56:35,235
You know, there aren't many dudes
left around who'll go for it.

584
00:56:35,737 --> 00:56:38,103
l mean, that's what it's all about,
isn't it?

585
00:56:38,273 --> 00:56:39,865
lt's like the man said:

586
00:56:40,442 --> 00:56:44,811
lt's better to go like this
than in some senseless tragedy.

587
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:49,474
l mean, l'd rather burn in at 200
miles an hour and have some laughs...

588
00:56:49,651 --> 00:56:51,551
...than to eat it in a car accident.

589
00:56:52,087 --> 00:56:54,715
l mean, that's a really dumb way to go.

590
00:56:59,861 --> 00:57:03,297
Oh, hey.
l got to tell you about my dream.

591
00:57:03,465 --> 00:57:05,626
You're gonna get into this.
This is great.

592
00:57:05,801 --> 00:57:08,395
No, really. The one thing l want to do...

593
00:57:08,570 --> 00:57:12,438
...before l join the cosmos
is to hang-glide off of Mount Everest.

594
00:57:12,607 --> 00:57:15,974
Wait. This is the best part. lt's naked!

595
00:57:16,144 --> 00:57:17,372
Yeah, man.

596
00:57:21,183 --> 00:57:24,812
Yeah, we're almost there, buddy.
The drop zone's dead ahead.

597
00:57:24,987 --> 00:57:29,117
-Hey, man, what a drag.
-The plane's coming.

598
00:57:29,291 --> 00:57:31,521
l mean, where do you guys get off?

599
00:57:31,693 --> 00:57:34,890
Biodegradable soap don't come cheap,
you know.

600
00:57:35,063 --> 00:57:38,328
Hey, look. Your buddies wrote you
some kind of message.

601
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:40,161
This is great!

602
00:57:40,335 --> 00:57:43,270
Like it's not enough
you already botched one load, huh?

603
00:57:43,438 --> 00:57:46,100
You guys are totally uncool.

604
00:57:46,341 --> 00:57:48,502
My flour!

605
00:57:48,677 --> 00:57:50,645
What a pisser!

606
00:57:54,249 --> 00:57:57,309
''Go on.''

607
00:57:57,486 --> 00:58:01,081
Hey, those guys spelled it out good.
Here, take a look.

608
00:58:04,092 --> 00:58:07,528
He's coming, you guys!
He's coming!

609
00:58:07,696 --> 00:58:12,531
-l don't know what you guys are on, but--
-Ma'am. Wait. Ma'am, no.

610
00:58:12,701 --> 00:58:15,261
-No, ma'am. No.
-Trelis, no, wait.

611
00:58:22,577 --> 00:58:25,307
Okay, man. Get ready.

612
00:58:27,883 --> 00:58:32,183
-Just keep your distance, man.
-We need that laundry a few more minutes.

613
00:58:32,354 --> 00:58:35,346
Listen, l ain't kinky. l ain't into that stuff.

614
00:58:39,361 --> 00:58:42,330
Okay, dude, out you go.

615
00:58:45,867 --> 00:58:49,997
Remember, l want to see
a good, hard arch.

616
00:58:56,311 --> 00:58:58,779
What am l doing out here?

617
00:58:58,947 --> 00:59:01,211
Go!

618
00:59:03,118 --> 00:59:06,019
Hey, man, you gotta let go!

619
00:59:06,188 --> 00:59:10,318
Don't get sick, man.
l can't land with you like that.

620
00:59:11,359 --> 00:59:13,759
Sorry, dude.

621
00:59:26,675 --> 00:59:29,610
A whole washday shot to hell.

622
00:59:30,178 --> 00:59:32,612
Wow, what a bummer.

623
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:41,548
Hey, Mr. Hicks, guess what.

624
00:59:42,224 --> 00:59:46,058
Don't get upset, man,
but there's something l gotta tell you.

625
00:59:46,228 --> 00:59:48,696
Your parachute didn't open, man.

626
00:59:50,031 --> 00:59:51,396
Mr. Hicks!

627
00:59:51,566 --> 00:59:55,627
Please, sweet Jesus, make his brain work.
Hit the reserve, son. Hit it.

628
00:59:55,804 --> 00:59:58,034
Mr. Hicks? Hey, listen, dude.

629
00:59:58,206 --> 01:00:02,939
lf you're into playing it close, that's cool,
but we're talking mega-malfunction here.

630
01:00:03,245 --> 01:00:05,076
Can you hear me, Mr. Hicks?

631
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:07,215
Come on, Phil! Hit it!

632
01:00:07,382 --> 01:00:09,976
Why don't you turn your volume up
just a tad.

633
01:00:11,620 --> 01:00:15,181
l said, your parachute didn't open, man!

634
01:00:15,357 --> 01:00:16,654
What?

635
01:00:17,092 --> 01:00:20,653
Okay, dude, no problem.
Just wanted to keep you posted.

636
01:00:20,896 --> 01:00:24,832
Now, why don't we pull
on that old reserve, huh?

637
01:00:25,133 --> 01:00:26,828
lt's on your belly, man.

638
01:00:27,002 --> 01:00:30,165
lt's a silver handle on your belly.

639
01:00:30,338 --> 01:00:33,068
Your stomach. Your tum-tum.

640
01:00:33,241 --> 01:00:35,801
Pull the handle on your stomach!

641
01:00:43,652 --> 01:00:46,678
Pull the handle on your stomach!

642
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:55,295
Pull the handle on your stomach!

643
01:01:00,869 --> 01:01:02,166
Philip!

644
01:01:07,876 --> 01:01:09,639
All right! Way to go, Mr. Hicks!

645
01:01:10,212 --> 01:01:15,081
Now get those legs together
and get ready to land!

646
01:01:17,719 --> 01:01:18,947
All right!

647
01:01:24,793 --> 01:01:26,385
All right!

648
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:47,175
Yeah, son!

649
01:01:49,918 --> 01:01:52,614
-You made it, son! You made it.
-Yes, you did.

650
01:01:52,787 --> 01:01:54,687
Philip. Listen to me, son.

651
01:01:55,190 --> 01:01:58,159
Philip, l didn't mean a word of it.
Not a word.

652
01:01:58,326 --> 01:02:00,021
Way to go, Mr. Hicks.

653
01:02:00,195 --> 01:02:03,062
That was a great recovery.
l want to shake your hand.

654
01:02:03,598 --> 01:02:08,592
-Say, he's got a good grip on that thing.
-Wake up, son. Wake up. lt's all over.

655
01:02:08,970 --> 01:02:12,929
Philip, forgive us.
We'll never badmouth you again, bud.

656
01:02:13,308 --> 01:02:14,900
Angels!

657
01:02:15,076 --> 01:02:18,045
No, son, it's us.
You made it. You're alive.

658
01:02:18,213 --> 01:02:22,115
And you're going down in the annals
of Grooverdom for this one, bud.

659
01:02:22,284 --> 01:02:23,979
Yeah!

660
01:02:26,588 --> 01:02:29,079
Oh, hold on. Wait a minute.
Hold it right there.

661
01:02:29,257 --> 01:02:32,420
-You get a free picture with your first jump.
-Okay.

662
01:02:32,594 --> 01:02:36,860
Oh, listen, l hope you ain't gonna be
too sore about this little screw up.

663
01:02:37,032 --> 01:02:39,398
Oh, no. No, no. Accidents will happen.

664
01:02:39,567 --> 01:02:41,797
Well, see, l don't want no bad press.

665
01:02:42,971 --> 01:02:44,233
Okay, hold it, hold it.

666
01:02:46,408 --> 01:02:48,842
l think you're gonna like this one.

667
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:08,588
You'll wear that thing out
looking at it so much, Philip.

668
01:03:13,802 --> 01:03:16,066
Weenies are like that.

669
01:03:24,813 --> 01:03:27,441
Thanks for letting us finish this thing.

670
01:03:58,446 --> 01:04:00,505
lt's the last one.

671
01:04:02,550 --> 01:04:04,575
How far is the border?

672
01:04:04,753 --> 01:04:08,587
Oh, it's about three or four miles thattaway.

673
01:04:10,191 --> 01:04:13,319
-Think he's still there? Dom?
-Yeah.

674
01:04:13,495 --> 01:04:15,656
lt don't all change.

675
01:04:16,431 --> 01:04:18,422
This place did.

676
01:04:19,234 --> 01:04:23,568
Remember when you were 1 6, 1 7,
looking ahead?

677
01:04:23,972 --> 01:04:26,406
How you knew the next couple
of years...

678
01:04:26,574 --> 01:04:28,201
...they'd be great.

679
01:04:28,376 --> 01:04:30,105
Just knew it.

680
01:04:31,045 --> 01:04:33,479
l don't feel that way no more.

681
01:04:36,518 --> 01:04:38,884
l'm not going with you, Gardner.

682
01:04:39,387 --> 01:04:41,150
l swore.

683
01:04:41,856 --> 01:04:43,448
l know.

684
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:48,251
How about you? What's after Mexico?

685
01:04:50,965 --> 01:04:53,433
l ain't too worried about that.

686
01:04:53,701 --> 01:04:57,398
You know, you could request
a duty assignment in Germany.

687
01:04:57,872 --> 01:05:00,136
We got a lot of bases there.

688
01:05:00,308 --> 01:05:01,832
Maybe l could help you out.

689
01:05:03,445 --> 01:05:05,640
Well, thank you, bud.

690
01:05:05,814 --> 01:05:10,080
But l just can't chance that.

691
01:05:10,485 --> 01:05:13,818
Anyway, you know me, gotta roam...

692
01:05:13,988 --> 01:05:17,321
...gotta bird-dog,
gotta cross females and fences...

693
01:05:17,492 --> 01:05:20,689
...and if you'd all just come with me,
you'd see.

694
01:05:44,519 --> 01:05:46,180
Well, then...

695
01:05:48,723 --> 01:05:51,385
...let's go dig that rascal up.

696
01:07:53,915 --> 01:07:55,246
That's it.

697
01:08:12,634 --> 01:08:14,534
Hello, bud.

698
01:09:03,251 --> 01:09:05,344
Here's to us, by God!

699
01:09:06,054 --> 01:09:09,217
To us, and that...

700
01:09:09,390 --> 01:09:11,950
...and privileges of youth.

701
01:09:12,794 --> 01:09:16,025
Here's to us and what we were.

702
01:09:17,098 --> 01:09:18,656
And what we'll be.

703
01:09:21,502 --> 01:09:23,527
And what we'll be.

704
01:09:40,054 --> 01:09:41,681
Was it worth it?

705
01:09:44,158 --> 01:09:45,648
Yeah.

706
01:09:46,194 --> 01:09:49,686
-lt was.
-No, it wasn't.

707
01:09:50,598 --> 01:09:52,429
l blew it.

708
01:09:53,067 --> 01:09:56,525
Goddamn it. She loved me, and l blew it.

709
01:09:57,038 --> 01:10:00,838
Maybe it never would have worked,
but at least l should have tried.

710
01:10:02,176 --> 01:10:05,942
l should have tried. Goddamn it,
and l blew it!

711
01:10:18,292 --> 01:10:19,987
You ever been in love, Philip?

712
01:10:24,732 --> 01:10:25,994
l don't know.

713
01:10:26,534 --> 01:10:31,062
Of course you know. lf you ever thought
you loved a woman, you loved her.

714
01:10:31,839 --> 01:10:33,830
That's all love is, mostly.

715
01:10:34,842 --> 01:10:36,366
Thoughts.

716
01:10:48,322 --> 01:10:52,383
Help me here. This boy's got
to get married.

717
01:10:55,429 --> 01:10:57,624
Yeah? Yes?

718
01:10:57,799 --> 01:11:00,165
Of course she said ''yes.''
l proposed for him.

719
01:11:00,334 --> 01:11:02,734
-Was she mad?
-lt's okay. l blamed it on you.

720
01:11:02,904 --> 01:11:06,169
-What?
-Philip, it's okay. l think she knows better.

721
01:11:06,340 --> 01:11:08,433
Now, for once in your life--

722
01:11:08,609 --> 01:11:11,134
For once in your life,
just do what l tell you...

723
01:11:11,312 --> 01:11:14,179
-...and we might pull this thing off.
-Yes, sir.

724
01:11:14,348 --> 01:11:17,249
-Okay, are we gonna take him to Dallas?
-No.

725
01:11:17,418 --> 01:11:20,182
Her family would kill him.
Besides, it'd be boring.

726
01:11:20,354 --> 01:11:23,517
-She's gotta come here.
-How?

727
01:11:27,695 --> 01:11:29,253
Give me that dime.

728
01:11:29,430 --> 01:11:32,729
There's only one human being
that can do it on time.

729
01:11:54,422 --> 01:11:57,823
l-35 to loop 635.

730
01:11:57,992 --> 01:12:00,085
South to Band-Aid.

731
01:12:00,695 --> 01:12:02,162
Band-Aid?

732
01:12:19,347 --> 01:12:21,372
Oh, Cleveland.

733
01:12:25,286 --> 01:12:28,084
You. Hey, you!

734
01:12:28,256 --> 01:12:30,816
Yeah. Terminate that flight path
immediately.

735
01:12:30,992 --> 01:12:36,487
And follow me into Love Field.
Now! l'm not telling you twice.

736
01:13:22,576 --> 01:13:23,941
What are you doing?

737
01:13:24,445 --> 01:13:27,380
Us? Oh, we're just setting up
for a wedding reception.

738
01:13:27,548 --> 01:13:29,607
-Here?
-Yep. A big one too.

739
01:13:29,784 --> 01:13:33,185
Champagne, roast duck, the works.

740
01:13:33,354 --> 01:13:36,380
ln fact, catering trucks ought to be
here any minute.

741
01:13:37,224 --> 01:13:39,920
Feel free to stay. There'll be plenty
for everybody.

742
01:13:40,094 --> 01:13:43,063
Oh! Napkins.

743
01:13:43,230 --> 01:13:45,824
l forgot to order the napkins.

744
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:48,561
You know, it's always something.

745
01:13:49,437 --> 01:13:51,234
Hell, l got napkins.

746
01:13:54,275 --> 01:13:55,537
Do you?

747
01:14:40,755 --> 01:14:42,552
Hello?

748
01:14:42,823 --> 01:14:44,313
Who?

749
01:14:44,492 --> 01:14:48,360
Just a moment.
Are you Mr. Barnes?

750
01:14:49,096 --> 01:14:52,259
-Well, yes, l am.
-Telephone.

751
01:14:54,902 --> 01:14:56,631
Thank you, sir.

752
01:14:57,104 --> 01:14:59,572
Hello? Yes.

753
01:14:59,740 --> 01:15:01,571
Yes.

754
01:15:02,043 --> 01:15:04,409
Oh, no. No.

755
01:15:04,578 --> 01:15:07,672
Well, how am l supposed--?

756
01:15:11,552 --> 01:15:14,419
-Talk about your rotten luck.
-What happened?

757
01:15:14,588 --> 01:15:18,922
No champagne. Truck flipped over in
Fort Stockton. Broke every damn bottle.

758
01:15:19,093 --> 01:15:21,118
What'll we drink?

759
01:15:23,364 --> 01:15:25,924
Say, you all drink beer?

760
01:15:28,269 --> 01:15:30,499
Well, yes. On occasion.

761
01:15:55,162 --> 01:15:56,322
-Hi there.
-Hi.

762
01:15:56,497 --> 01:15:58,158
-You mind if l cut in?
-Sure.

763
01:15:58,332 --> 01:16:00,095
Thanks a lot.

764
01:16:07,308 --> 01:16:09,674
l wish we'd ordered beans,
instead of caviar.

765
01:16:09,844 --> 01:16:11,709
l'll go right home and fix a batch.

766
01:16:11,879 --> 01:16:13,608
-You don't have to.
-No problem.

767
01:16:13,781 --> 01:16:16,978
l hope they're bringing lots of tables
on the catering truck.

768
01:16:17,151 --> 01:16:19,517
There's a slew of tables
at the schoolhouse.

769
01:16:19,687 --> 01:16:22,485
Well, l wonder if we might borrow a few,
just in case.

770
01:16:22,656 --> 01:16:25,648
l reckon. My son is principal.

771
01:16:25,826 --> 01:16:27,657
Say, you looking for me?

772
01:16:27,828 --> 01:16:30,991
Ed. The butcher.

773
01:16:31,298 --> 01:16:33,391
Ed, this is so embarrassing.

774
01:16:48,415 --> 01:16:53,580
Never do it. Never cater another party
with those people. You folks are so kind.

775
01:16:54,221 --> 01:16:56,883
-Why, thank you.
-You're welcome.

776
01:16:57,057 --> 01:16:59,548
We lost the band!

777
01:17:03,497 --> 01:17:06,762
-Mayor.
-Yeah, l heard.

778
01:17:06,934 --> 01:17:10,665
That's a shame. There's some fellas
here in town that can cut a mean--

779
01:17:10,838 --> 01:17:14,001
Yeah. Well, the band was bringing
the decorations too.

780
01:17:14,175 --> 01:17:17,235
See, they were bringing
our tree lights. Everything.

781
01:17:17,711 --> 01:17:20,612
l'm sorry you hooked those extensions
