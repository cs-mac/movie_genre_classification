1
00:04:04,085 --> 00:04:06,212
Not a single arrest today, Mother.

2
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:09,279
Don't get discouraged.
I'm sure you'll do better next time.

3
00:04:09,357 --> 00:04:10,984
You were great, Sister George.

4
00:04:11,058 --> 00:04:15,461
What do you mean, Sister George?
That's St. George, the dragon killer.

5
00:04:20,234 --> 00:04:22,668
- Did you hear that, Mother?
- I did.

6
00:04:23,604 --> 00:04:27,631
And you're looking at one dragon
St. George isn't going to kill.

7
00:04:29,944 --> 00:04:32,742
Have you discussed the youth rally
with the sisters?

8
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:35,112
Oh, yes. We've talked about it.

9
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:39,113
I can't say they're entirely enthusiastic,
Your Excellency.

10
00:04:39,754 --> 00:04:40,948
Except for Sister George.

11
00:04:41,022 --> 00:04:43,923
But then, going on the rally
was her idea in the first place.

12
00:04:43,991 --> 00:04:45,788
And a very good idea.

13
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,225
The Church wants
our young people involved, Mother.

14
00:04:49,297 --> 00:04:51,561
There are great changes in the air.

15
00:04:51,632 --> 00:04:55,500
And Sister George is close
to what's happening with our youths.

16
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:59,870
Do you mind if I'm not exactly crazy
about what's happening with our youth?

17
00:05:00,608 --> 00:05:03,543
You haven't expressed your
feelings about the rally.

18
00:05:03,611 --> 00:05:07,411
Let's say I'm trying to keep an open mind,
although I do have reservations.

19
00:05:07,481 --> 00:05:11,440
It is a long trip. 3,000 miles by bus.

20
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,851
That's not what I meant, Your Excellency.

21
00:05:13,921 --> 00:05:16,321
Now that you mention it,
if we go to a rally...

22
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:18,221
couldn't we go to one closer to home?

23
00:05:18,292 --> 00:05:19,759
That's not a bad thought.

24
00:05:19,827 --> 00:05:23,263
Perhaps you and Sister George
can organize one in this area.

25
00:05:23,331 --> 00:05:25,060
That's not what I meant, either.

26
00:05:25,132 --> 00:05:28,465
Of course, I realize that
there isn't much time in which to prepare...

27
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:31,403
for such a long journey.
You may not be able to cope with it.

28
00:05:31,472 --> 00:05:33,406
Anyone who's coped with adolescent girls...

29
00:05:33,474 --> 00:05:36,068
for 20 years and survived
can cope with anything.

30
00:05:36,143 --> 00:05:38,373
Splendid. Then it's all settled.

31
00:05:38,446 --> 00:05:41,142
- What's settled?
- That you're going to the rally.

32
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:45,379
- That isn't what I said, Your Excellency.
- You'd rather Sister George took the girls?

33
00:05:45,453 --> 00:05:49,321
I should say not. That bus doesn't leave
with my girls unless I'm on it.

34
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:52,382
Then it is all settled.
You're making the trip, too.

35
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,655
No. You see, I was trying...

36
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,564
You trapped me, Your Excellency.

37
00:05:57,632 --> 00:06:02,296
If I did, it'll be the first time
I've been able to beat you at your own game.

38
00:06:02,703 --> 00:06:04,898
Put aside your reservations, Mother.

39
00:06:04,972 --> 00:06:08,100
I'm sure you're going to enjoy
every minute of it.

40
00:06:08,175 --> 00:06:11,167
- I doubt it, but I'll try.
- I envy you.

41
00:06:11,445 --> 00:06:14,175
It's going to be a wonderful experience.

42
00:06:14,548 --> 00:06:16,880
We really should congratulate
Sister George...

43
00:06:16,951 --> 00:06:20,352
for suggesting that St. Francis
participate in the rally.

44
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:22,753
Yes, of course, Your Excellency.

45
00:06:24,158 --> 00:06:28,652
We need Sister George, Mother.
She's a dynamic force.

46
00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:30,856
But she does need direction.

47
00:06:31,132 --> 00:06:34,932
And with your help,
she'll make an important contribution.

48
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:39,338
You've been very patient with her,
and I know it's been trying.

49
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:43,271
In fact, sometimes I wonder
how you've been able to take it.

50
00:06:43,978 --> 00:06:45,445
I pray a lot.

51
00:06:47,114 --> 00:06:50,811
Well, you couldn't find a better place
to pray in.

52
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,247
There's such serenity here. Such peace.

53
00:06:57,391 --> 00:07:00,656
For these rare blessings,
we should give thanks to- -

54
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,196
Sister George.

55
00:07:23,017 --> 00:07:24,143
It worked!

56
00:07:24,218 --> 00:07:26,743
Of course it worked. What did you expect?

57
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:30,951
I expect you to run a class,
not a training school for mad bombers.

58
00:07:32,026 --> 00:07:36,690
Teaching children to make bombs is
not part of our curriculum, Sister George.

59
00:07:37,164 --> 00:07:40,031
My lecture was intended
to alert the class...

60
00:07:40,101 --> 00:07:43,161
to the dangers
in ordinary household chemicals.

61
00:07:44,171 --> 00:07:48,198
I certainly never expected the girls
to use that information to make a bomb.

62
00:07:48,275 --> 00:07:50,038
- Who would?
- I would.

63
00:07:50,978 --> 00:07:54,744
But then I've had 20 years
in which to familiarize myself...

64
00:07:54,815 --> 00:07:58,273
with the Machiavellian workings
of the adolescent mind.

65
00:07:58,386 --> 00:08:00,718
And you're relatively new at it.

66
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:06,387
I'm also aware that we lack certain
facilities that you were accustomed to...

67
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,793
at your former post,
and that our building is antiquated.

68
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:13,023
Not half as antiquated
as some of the sisters.

69
00:08:14,468 --> 00:08:16,800
They are dedicated nuns and teachers...

70
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:21,274
and St. Francis has one of the
highest scholastic standings in the state.

71
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:25,137
When our girls leave here, Sister,
they are educated.

72
00:08:25,212 --> 00:08:27,578
They're literate, not educated.

73
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:30,779
There is a difference, Mother.

74
00:08:31,285 --> 00:08:34,812
There is a whole world
outside of St. Francis.

75
00:08:35,322 --> 00:08:37,586
And these girls should know about it.

76
00:08:39,693 --> 00:08:42,856
That's true. But first we must do our job.

77
00:08:43,597 --> 00:08:45,622
So in the future, please try to remember...

78
00:08:45,699 --> 00:08:48,930
that when you plant a seed
in a mind like Rosabelle's...

79
00:08:49,003 --> 00:08:52,404
chances are you will get an explosion,
not a flower.

80
00:08:58,846 --> 00:09:02,839
I called you together because I have
very important news for you.

81
00:09:04,485 --> 00:09:08,387
St. Francis will definitely participate
in the Interfaith Youth Rally...

82
00:09:08,456 --> 00:09:11,186
to be held in Santa Barbara, California.

83
00:09:11,659 --> 00:09:15,095
His Excellency is very enthusiastic
about the project.

84
00:09:15,729 --> 00:09:18,254
- Bless him!
- Then we're really going.

85
00:09:18,466 --> 00:09:20,866
It'll be a new experience for us.

86
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:24,200
The rally will be interfaith,
interracial and coeducational.

87
00:09:24,271 --> 00:09:27,763
Coeducational? With boys?

88
00:09:29,677 --> 00:09:33,374
The expenses will run about $150
for each girl...

89
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:36,473
and those chosen to go
will have to contact their parents.

90
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:39,542
We're leaving the day after graduation,
so we have a lot to do.

91
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:43,112
Sister Rose Marie will get in touch
with our schools across the country...

92
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:46,921
and make sleeping arrangements,
Sister Clarissa will drive the bus...

93
00:09:46,994 --> 00:09:51,761
and Sister Celestine will arrange a
music program to be presented at the rally.

94
00:09:51,832 --> 00:09:56,269
And, Sister George, I'd like you
to prepare an art and science display...

95
00:09:56,337 --> 00:09:59,829
to show the other schools there
the kind of things we're doing here.

96
00:09:59,907 --> 00:10:02,899
- I'll get right to it, Mother.
- Sister George...

97
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,942
before I forget it...

98
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:09,008
His Excellency asked me
to congratulate you.

99
00:10:09,183 --> 00:10:10,775
For the bombing?

100
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:14,443
For suggesting that St. Francis
take part in the rally.

101
00:10:14,622 --> 00:10:17,648
I ask you Sisters to recommend
students you think should go...

102
00:10:17,725 --> 00:10:21,286
- based on certain qualifications.
- What are the qualifications, Mother?

103
00:10:21,362 --> 00:10:25,423
Junior and senior girls,
B average or better, and the- -

104
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:26,989
But, Mother, a B average?

105
00:10:27,067 --> 00:10:30,525
That will exclude so many
well- rounded and creative students.

106
00:10:30,604 --> 00:10:35,303
A B average, cooperative attitudes,
and reasonable hygiene habits.

107
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:38,576
I guess that eliminates all my girls.

108
00:10:38,646 --> 00:10:41,615
Maybe if you looked under
those turn- of- the- century gym suits...

109
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:43,149
your girls wear...

110
00:10:43,217 --> 00:10:45,651
you might find one live one
you could recommend.

111
00:10:45,719 --> 00:10:50,247
They're not turn-of-the century.
I designed those gym suits myself in 1946.

112
00:10:50,324 --> 00:10:51,951
More like 1846.

113
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,618
Sisters, please.

114
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:56,595
This is a community of nuns,
not an army barracks.

115
00:10:56,664 --> 00:10:59,155
Boys!

116
00:11:01,635 --> 00:11:05,696
But, Daddy, it's only $150.
That's cheaper than sending me to camp.

117
00:11:05,773 --> 00:11:09,732
And it's going to be very educational.
There'll be folksingers.

118
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:13,610
Folksingers aren't communists, Daddy.
Only those with beards!

119
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:26,217
Password.

120
00:11:26,293 --> 00:11:29,228
''Agent 007's the greatest thing
since popcorn.''

121
00:11:31,198 --> 00:11:33,666
Full house.
We're taking reservations for Friday.

122
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:35,861
- That's not fair.
- So sue me.

123
00:11:37,438 --> 00:11:39,303
- Pay up.
- Okay. I got it.

124
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:53,313
Turn it down!
Do you want to wake up the Gestapo?

125
00:11:55,456 --> 00:11:57,981
- You gave me a Canadian dime.
- Tough.

126
00:11:58,225 --> 00:12:01,956
It sure is, because if you don't pay up,
you're not going to get in anymore.

127
00:12:02,029 --> 00:12:05,089
And if you don't stop bugging me,
I'll go to Reverend Mother...

128
00:12:05,165 --> 00:12:07,759
and tell her you're having orgies
in the bathroom.

129
00:12:07,835 --> 00:12:08,927
Fink.

130
00:12:16,377 --> 00:12:19,403
- How are you doing?
- $112.50 so far.

131
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,244
Not bad, since we've only been in business
for a few months.

132
00:12:22,316 --> 00:12:25,251
That's more than half of what you need
to get you to the rally.

133
00:12:25,319 --> 00:12:28,220
- You'll make it.
- Sure. All I have to do is get chosen.

134
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,484
Reverend Mother thinks
I'm the devil's disciple...

135
00:12:30,557 --> 00:12:33,890
with homicidal tendencies
and overtones of psychotic neuroses.

136
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,588
Nobody's perfect.

137
00:12:52,346 --> 00:12:55,975
- How's business?
- Just fair.

138
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,287
It's going to get worse.

139
00:13:03,624 --> 00:13:05,922
What pea- brain pulled the plug?

140
00:13:20,641 --> 00:13:23,701
As you're all such music lovers,
you'll be delighted to know...

141
00:13:23,777 --> 00:13:27,440
that you're going to spend the next two
weekends cleaning out the music room.

142
00:13:27,514 --> 00:13:29,175
Get Devon off the floor.

143
00:13:30,517 --> 00:13:33,418
As for you two, I'll see you in the morning.

144
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:41,685
Boy, it's getting harder and harder
to make that dollar around this place.

145
00:13:44,465 --> 00:13:45,989
And it's going to get even harder.

146
00:13:46,066 --> 00:13:49,263
As of now, St. Francis- A- Go- Go
is out of business.

147
00:13:53,073 --> 00:13:57,203
All right, girls, on the double!
Left, right, one, two.

148
00:14:05,686 --> 00:14:09,053
- I'll die if I don't get chosen.
- Of course you'll get chosen.

149
00:14:09,123 --> 00:14:13,025
And so will I. After all,
the qualifications are so elementary.

150
00:14:13,427 --> 00:14:17,727
B average, good social attitude,
reasonable hygiene habits.

151
00:14:17,798 --> 00:14:20,198
That takes care of me. I got a D average.

152
00:14:20,267 --> 00:14:23,498
Reverend Mother says my attitude stinks,
and I'm a slob.

153
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:26,471
- Nobody's perfect.
- Hey, we'll be late for class.

154
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:29,304
Who wants to go
to a stinking rally anyways?

155
00:14:29,376 --> 00:14:31,844
You're only saying that
because you're not going.

156
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:33,277
Shrivel up.

157
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:38,442
- And you're not going either.
- I'm straight A's, three years running.

158
00:14:38,619 --> 00:14:41,144
- Grabs you, don't it?
- Not terribly.

159
00:14:41,488 --> 00:14:43,718
Grades only count for so much.

160
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:48,125
You don't get points for blowing up the lab,
except from Sister George.

161
00:14:49,129 --> 00:14:50,187
Bye.

162
00:14:53,534 --> 00:14:57,903
- I think I hate her.
- So why should you be an exception?

163
00:15:02,142 --> 00:15:03,700
No chance, right?

164
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:07,144
About as much as a snowball in...
Hello, Sister George.

165
00:15:08,415 --> 00:15:10,849
What's our local mafia up to today?

166
00:15:10,918 --> 00:15:14,820
- We were just talking about the rally.
- And how great it would be if we're chosen.

167
00:15:14,888 --> 00:15:18,654
It's going to be a memorable experience,
and one that we'll cherish forever.

168
00:15:18,725 --> 00:15:21,353
You don't have to do a snow job on me.

169
00:15:23,497 --> 00:15:27,365
You know, I'm the one who suggested
going to the rally to Mother.

170
00:15:28,502 --> 00:15:30,732
And I have the scars to prove it.

171
00:15:32,105 --> 00:15:35,370
You don't happen to know
if we were chosen, do you?

172
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:39,340
That's classified information.

173
00:15:40,447 --> 00:15:44,281
- But you know whether or not you qualify.
- That's the trouble.

174
00:15:44,585 --> 00:15:48,749
You don't suppose Reverend Mother would
break down and reconsider so we could go?

175
00:15:49,256 --> 00:15:54,159
Right now, Mother wouldn't give
either one of you a free pass to a disaster.

176
00:15:54,561 --> 00:15:56,859
Isn't there anything we can do?

177
00:15:58,665 --> 00:16:00,530
You might try praying.

178
00:16:04,471 --> 00:16:09,170
Praying helps, but making a pitch
can't hurt. I'll see what I can do.

179
00:16:09,243 --> 00:16:12,542
But I'm not promising it'll work.
Meanwhile, cheer up.

180
00:16:12,613 --> 00:16:16,071
You want people to think
St. Francis isn't a fun place?

181
00:16:19,319 --> 00:16:22,777
- Will you take care of these, Sister, please?
- Testing.

182
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:27,624
Testing. One. two. buckle my shoe.

183
00:16:27,694 --> 00:16:29,685
- Sister.
- Watch out below!

184
00:16:33,133 --> 00:16:37,467
I'm sorry, Mother. It's for Sister Clarissa.
She's been looking for it.

185
00:16:37,671 --> 00:16:40,037
I wasn't aware we were going by boat.

186
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:43,968
It's not for sailing, Mother.
It's for sitting.

187
00:16:47,281 --> 00:16:48,942
Thank you. Mother.

188
00:16:49,917 --> 00:16:53,478
There's nothing wrong
with my hearing, Sister, yet.

189
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:58,221
- C- rations?
- For the trip.

190
00:16:58,592 --> 00:17:01,425
I really don't think we'll
need them, Sister.

191
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:03,328
C- rations.

192
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:07,026
We're not going to war, Sister,
we're going to California.

193
00:17:08,335 --> 00:17:11,031
What if we can't find a restaurant sometime?

194
00:17:11,104 --> 00:17:14,972
Then we'll live on nuts and berries,
like the rest of the natives.

195
00:17:15,042 --> 00:17:18,239
Mother, I have a marvelous new poster
to show you.

196
00:17:26,887 --> 00:17:30,789
- You like this sort of thing, Sister?
- Very much.

197
00:17:34,661 --> 00:17:37,562
- It's a light bulb.
- Of course.

198
00:17:38,899 --> 00:17:43,563
I think of it as a contemporary still life
which reflects our culture.

199
00:17:51,745 --> 00:17:54,680
It's great. It's just great.

200
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,311
I'm sorry, Sister.

201
00:18:02,589 --> 00:18:04,989
Ohio, lllinois, Oklahoma, New...

202
00:18:07,494 --> 00:18:10,088
New Mexico comes after Texas, Sister.

203
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:18,836
How I love to hear the organ

204
00:18:19,339 --> 00:18:22,570
In the chapel in the moonlight

205
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,873
As we're strolling down the aisle

206
00:18:24,945 --> 00:18:29,041
We're really not going to do that one
at the rally, are we, Sister?

207
00:18:31,184 --> 00:18:32,378
We are.

208
00:18:32,686 --> 00:18:36,622
We have always sung it.
It's tradition at St. Francis.

209
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:39,624
Where roses entwine

210
00:18:41,028 --> 00:18:44,361
How about if, just this once,
we blow tradition?

211
00:18:45,532 --> 00:18:47,830
Why don't you borrow
some of Rosabelle's records...

212
00:18:47,901 --> 00:18:50,836
and get an idea
of how the kids are swinging?

213
00:18:52,105 --> 00:18:54,266
Ask her for The Gorillas' new album.

214
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:58,368
Got Wheels and I'm Going to Heaven. Baby.

215
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:06,311
She makes the most
outrageous suggestions.

216
00:19:06,386 --> 00:19:09,253
- Reverend Mother, I was supposed to- -
- We're not natives.

217
00:19:09,322 --> 00:19:13,520
Sisters, please.
I'm going to talk to her again.

218
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,894
I know you find
many of her avant-garde ideas...

219
00:19:16,963 --> 00:19:19,864
more becoming to a coffeehouse
than a convent.

220
00:19:19,933 --> 00:19:21,264
I do, too.

221
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:25,831
But we are committed to make this trip,
so let's make the best of things.

222
00:19:25,906 --> 00:19:27,965
I realize it isn't easy for you.

223
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:31,033
But the world is changing,
and if we're to be a part of it...

224
00:19:31,111 --> 00:19:35,172
rather than apart from it,
we may have to make some changes, too.

225
00:19:35,949 --> 00:19:40,045
Even if we don't agree with everything,
it's important that we keep an open mind.

226
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,179
Don't you think so, Sisters?

227
00:19:44,324 --> 00:19:45,382
Brainwashed.

228
00:19:45,459 --> 00:19:46,653
Mother.

229
00:19:47,861 --> 00:19:51,854
- Did Sister Clarissa tell you about the bus?
- What about the bus?

230
00:19:55,035 --> 00:19:58,937
The springs are shot, the radiator leaks,
the clutch slips, the block's cracked...

231
00:19:59,005 --> 00:20:00,666
and we need new tires.

232
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:04,370
- The bus will never make it cross- country.
- It certainly will.

233
00:20:04,444 --> 00:20:07,902
Chuck, at the service station,
said there's still plenty of life in it.

234
00:20:07,981 --> 00:20:11,917
Chuck, at the service station,
doesn't know his gasket from a casket.

235
00:20:11,985 --> 00:20:15,079
The only thing holding
that old jalopy together is a prayer.

236
00:20:15,155 --> 00:20:17,146
What's wrong with prayer?

237
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:19,387
Nothing, Sister.

238
00:20:19,459 --> 00:20:22,724
Every time I get into that old heap,
I pray to God...

239
00:20:22,963 --> 00:20:24,453
for a new bus!

240
00:20:44,384 --> 00:20:47,876
I can't tell you how grateful we are
for the new bus, Mr. Clancy.

241
00:20:47,954 --> 00:20:51,219
- It's very generous of you.
- My pleasure, Reverend Mother.

242
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:55,125
Actually, I made a very good deal
through one of our subsidiary companies...

243
00:20:55,195 --> 00:20:59,097
- and, after all, it is a tax deduction.
- Yes, I know.

244
00:20:59,566 --> 00:21:03,935
Isn't it wonderful how our tax structure
brings out the best in people?

245
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:08,400
That's very good, Reverend Mother.

246
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:11,137
Girls. line up for roll call.

247
00:21:14,214 --> 00:21:16,774
Devon, Janis...

248
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:18,173
Sue Ellen.

249
00:21:19,085 --> 00:21:22,020
We'll take very good care of Marvel Ann,
Mr. Clancy.

250
00:21:22,088 --> 00:21:25,285
- I know how you worry about her.
- Yes, thank you.

251
00:21:25,358 --> 00:21:27,826
Naturally, I'll miss
not being with her this summer.

252
00:21:27,894 --> 00:21:32,456
If my associates and I didn't have business
to transact in Europe...

253
00:21:32,632 --> 00:21:34,759
I'd have her with me, of course.

254
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,003
Of course.

255
00:21:42,943 --> 00:21:46,401
I really appreciate your taking her along
on the rally.

256
00:21:46,546 --> 00:21:50,073
I realize that she didn't qualify exactly.
Her grades- -

257
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:52,812
Other things were taken into consideration.

258
00:21:52,886 --> 00:21:56,447
Goodbye, Daddy.
I'll write every day. Arrivederci!

259
00:21:56,823 --> 00:21:59,690
Barbara, Hilarie...

260
00:22:00,727 --> 00:22:03,195
Marvel Ann, and now Patty.

261
00:22:06,066 --> 00:22:07,055
Bye.

262
00:22:08,335 --> 00:22:09,632
Who you poking?

263
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:12,900
I see your devoted, sore-loser friend
didn't come to say goodbye.

264
00:22:12,973 --> 00:22:15,032
Rosabelle should've been chosen to go.

265
00:22:15,108 --> 00:22:18,134
Maybe Reverend Mother was afraid
she'd blow up the bus.

266
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:20,543
And, of course, the only reason
you were chosen...

267
00:22:20,614 --> 00:22:23,310
is because your father donated the bus
to St. Francis.

268
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:24,748
Don't knock it.

269
00:22:24,818 --> 00:22:28,914
The only crummy thing your father
ever donated to St. Francis was you.

270
00:22:38,999 --> 00:22:40,796
Mother, who is that?

271
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:48,969
One of Mr. Clancy's business associates.

272
00:23:08,128 --> 00:23:10,187
Bye- bye. Take care.

273
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:32,885
We're off and running.
Weather ahead, clear and sunny.

274
00:24:23,069 --> 00:24:27,472
The red ones represent the genes,
and the blue ones are the chromosomes.

275
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:30,938
- What are the white ones for?
- Ping- pong.

276
00:24:50,263 --> 00:24:54,165
Mother, it says here
there's a wonderful zoo in St. Louis.

277
00:24:54,234 --> 00:24:58,000
I was wondering if we could visit there.
I think the girls might enjoy that.

278
00:24:58,071 --> 00:25:00,403
We'll have to wait until we get...

279
00:25:04,244 --> 00:25:05,711
Stop the bus!

280
00:25:23,696 --> 00:25:25,186
Open the door.

281
00:25:48,221 --> 00:25:49,984
The only way to fly.

282
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:56,418
There. That ought to hold it.

283
00:25:57,063 --> 00:26:00,863
Mother, I'm so glad you decided
not to send Rosabelle home.

284
00:26:01,301 --> 00:26:04,793
It would break her heart.
And she did show a great deal of initiative.

285
00:26:04,871 --> 00:26:07,499
Initiative, my foot.
The only reason she's going along...

286
00:26:07,574 --> 00:26:10,008
is because it's too complicated
to send her home.

287
00:26:10,076 --> 00:26:12,510
She did get written permission
from her parents.

288
00:26:12,579 --> 00:26:14,740
To ride on the top of the bus?

289
00:26:14,814 --> 00:26:17,044
She'll have to borrow some clothes
from someone.

290
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:20,814
It's okay, Reverend Mother.
All her clothes are in my suitcase.

291
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:25,557
That figures.

292
00:26:26,092 --> 00:26:29,186
Shall we get the show
on the road again, Sister?

293
00:27:15,308 --> 00:27:18,744
- Thank you, Sister. Come and see us again.
- Thank you, we will.

294
00:27:18,811 --> 00:27:21,075
$12.40!

295
00:27:21,147 --> 00:27:23,638
My old bus wouldn't use that much gas
in a month.

296
00:27:23,716 --> 00:27:26,480
It couldn't. It was usually
in the garage, being repaired.

297
00:27:26,553 --> 00:27:28,248
All the girls on the bus, Sister?

298
00:27:28,321 --> 00:27:31,347
Everyone but Sister George,
Rosabelle, and Marvel Ann.

299
00:27:31,424 --> 00:27:33,824
Where have they taken off to now?

300
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:38,289
...four, six, eight,
Rotelle, we won't negotiate!

301
00:27:38,398 --> 00:27:42,562
One, two, three, four,
patronize another store!

302
00:27:42,635 --> 00:27:47,004
Two, four, six, eight,
Rotelle, we won't negotiate!

303
00:27:47,073 --> 00:27:51,305
One, two, three, four,
patronize another store.

304
00:27:51,411 --> 00:27:53,504
Five, six, seven, nine...

305
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:56,113
Get those three out of that line.

306
00:29:03,383 --> 00:29:06,216
- What is it, Sister?
- The engine stalled.

307
00:29:06,853 --> 00:29:11,017
Keep your seats. Don't panic.
The train's not in sight. Keep trying.

308
00:29:14,594 --> 00:29:16,084
Open the door.

309
00:29:18,498 --> 00:29:20,728
- I can't. It's stuck.
- Oh, no!

310
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:24,065
The emergency exit. Out the back door.
Don't stop to take anything.

311
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:25,331
Out of the bus.

312
00:29:30,743 --> 00:29:32,711
Out of the way! Open the door!

313
00:29:32,779 --> 00:29:34,747
I can't! It's jammed!

314
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:39,209
Open the windows!
Climb out the windows, girls!

315
00:29:39,886 --> 00:29:44,687
- I'll get the door from the outside!
- Hurry, girls! Don't panic!

316
00:29:56,636 --> 00:29:58,934
It's stuck. Rosabelle, help me!

317
00:30:03,076 --> 00:30:05,374
Come on, girls, quickly. Hurry.

318
00:30:13,586 --> 00:30:14,917
Push!

319
00:30:21,961 --> 00:30:24,452
Mary Jo, go. Mary Jo, please, go.

320
00:30:26,999 --> 00:30:29,695
Come, darling. Sister, help me, please.

321
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:17,465
It's the same at both ends, Sister.

322
00:32:17,543 --> 00:32:20,637
Mother, did you see
what Sister George is doing?

323
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:33,821
As Rosabelle says,
"It's the only way to fly."

324
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:43,325
Boy, wasn't that great?

325
00:32:44,871 --> 00:32:48,671
You get such a charge out of things.
I don't know how you ever became a nun.

326
00:32:48,741 --> 00:32:51,039
I get a charge out of that, too.

327
00:33:00,253 --> 00:33:02,653
- Let's do it again!
- Let's switch.

328
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:09,153
- Better get those two out of there.
- Yes, Mother.

329
00:33:24,577 --> 00:33:28,411
- Are you going on this one, too, Sister?
- Sure. I'm going on everything.

330
00:34:02,481 --> 00:34:04,415
Oh, my, this is so exciting!

331
00:34:16,162 --> 00:34:19,529
I think we should get started.
Round up the girls, Sister.

332
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,932
- Where are they, Mother?
- Wherever Sister George is.

333
00:34:23,069 --> 00:34:25,765
Considering the amount of time
the girls spend with us...

334
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:29,205
- I really don't know why we came along.
- We were blackmailed.

335
00:35:29,935 --> 00:35:31,698
It's a lovely place, dear Sister.

336
00:35:31,771 --> 00:35:34,899
I hope the arrangements you've made
across the country are as nice.

337
00:35:34,974 --> 00:35:36,635
Thank you, Mother.

338
00:35:43,949 --> 00:35:45,041
Boys!

339
00:35:58,731 --> 00:36:02,098
Hold it down, fellows!
You've seen girls before.

340
00:36:04,336 --> 00:36:08,238
- I'm Father Chase. Welcome to St. Francis.
- Thank you, Father.

341
00:36:08,474 --> 00:36:11,341
- They're boys.
- I should hope so.

342
00:36:11,477 --> 00:36:15,504
St. Francis is a boys' school, Sister.
This is our summer session.

343
00:36:15,614 --> 00:36:19,106
All right, fellows,
let's get some of that luggage down.

344
00:36:19,351 --> 00:36:20,841
Please, don't.

345
00:36:23,456 --> 00:36:25,390
Were you aware
when you made arrangements...

346
00:36:25,458 --> 00:36:27,585
that this was a boys' school,
Sister Rose Marie?

347
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:30,595
- Mother- -
- I made these arrangements, Mother.

348
00:36:35,901 --> 00:36:37,061
I see.

349
00:36:39,171 --> 00:36:43,301
Mother, we could use the emergency fund
and go to a motel.

350
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:55,721
No, we'll stay here,
just as Sister George planned.

351
00:36:55,788 --> 00:36:59,781
All right, girls, get your things.
We're spending the night here.

352
00:37:00,126 --> 00:37:02,026
Kids, hold it down.

353
00:37:04,163 --> 00:37:05,824
Mother, I'm sorry- -

354
00:37:05,898 --> 00:37:08,423
Contain yourself, Sister.
It's not the end of the world.

355
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:10,933
But it could be the end of us...

356
00:37:11,203 --> 00:37:14,832
if we just sit around
and wait for our arteries to harden...

357
00:37:14,907 --> 00:37:17,876
while the rest of the world is in a turmoil.

358
00:37:22,414 --> 00:37:25,212
I want to make a meaningful contribution.

359
00:37:25,584 --> 00:37:27,882
And I want to make it with joy.

360
00:37:29,054 --> 00:37:32,148
If I conduct myself
like a 20th century woman...

361
00:37:32,424 --> 00:37:35,120
I don't want to be patronized
by people who say:

362
00:37:35,194 --> 00:37:39,187
"Look at that darling little nun.
She's just like a real person."

363
00:37:39,598 --> 00:37:43,659
I am a real person.
Flesh, blood, feelings and convictions.

364
00:37:44,036 --> 00:37:48,097
That's for sure. Sister's a
real firebrand, isn't she, Mother?

365
00:37:49,441 --> 00:37:52,877
Let's hope she doesn't intend
to burn down the church.

366
00:37:53,979 --> 00:37:57,312
No, just warm it up a bit.

367
00:38:00,219 --> 00:38:02,016
More coffee, Sisters?

368
00:38:03,756 --> 00:38:07,192
- Please continue, Sister.
- I'm sure Sister intends to.

369
00:38:09,628 --> 00:38:14,327
Father Chase, don't you feel
the most important thing...

370
00:38:15,134 --> 00:38:17,830
is to share people's lives and problems?

371
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:22,666
And we certainly can't do that if we're
locked away in a little "nun world."

372
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:25,537
I don't think you can call us "locked away."

373
00:38:25,611 --> 00:38:28,307
After all, we're not a cloistered order.

374
00:38:29,882 --> 00:38:34,216
Cloister isn't always a place, Mother.
Sometimes, it's a state of mind.

375
00:38:34,753 --> 00:38:36,584
That's very true, Sister.

376
00:38:36,655 --> 00:38:41,422
But aren't you afraid of becoming less a nun
than say, well, a social worker, Sister?

377
00:38:43,028 --> 00:38:46,225
No, Father. Wherever we go,
our faith goes with us.

378
00:38:46,832 --> 00:38:49,232
And we hold it up for all to see.

379
00:38:49,335 --> 00:38:52,793
Faith, like love, should be shared,
not hoarded.

380
00:38:55,908 --> 00:38:58,843
- Beautifully put, Sister.
- Thank you, Father.

381
00:38:59,245 --> 00:39:01,907
There's a new wind blowing
through the church, and I -

382
00:39:01,981 --> 00:39:05,439
A new wind is fine,
but we can do without a typhoon.

383
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:38,045
I know each time she smiles at you

384
00:39:38,117 --> 00:39:40,711
You think you found an angel's face,

385
00:39:40,786 --> 00:39:43,186
But don't give in. my friend

386
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:48,215
Where angels go. trouble follows

387
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:54,290
And when she's in your arms
you feel so heavenly

388
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,401
that you can't see the danger there

389
00:39:57,469 --> 00:40:00,302
Take care. where angels go

390
00:40:02,107 --> 00:40:03,438
trouble follows

391
00:40:05,077 --> 00:40:07,443
Come on down

392
00:40:07,513 --> 00:40:10,914
Get your feet back on the ground

393
00:40:10,983 --> 00:40:15,920
And your head out of the clouds above

394
00:40:16,221 --> 00:40:18,587
My friend. now listen to me

395
00:40:18,857 --> 00:40:20,825
Take it slow

396
00:40:20,893 --> 00:40:24,294
'Cause there's something you should know

397
00:40:25,531 --> 00:40:30,161
Angels never fall in love

398
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:34,098
Fall in love

399
00:40:34,173 --> 00:40:37,404
Fall in love

400
00:40:41,146 --> 00:40:44,604
So if she flies away today

401
00:40:44,683 --> 00:40:48,585
Don't feel too bad. and don't be sad
It's just as well

402
00:40:49,021 --> 00:40:51,546
You know. where angels go

403
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:54,917
trouble follows

404
00:40:56,929 --> 00:41:01,525
Trouble follows

405
00:41:03,202 --> 00:41:05,500
Come on down

406
00:41:05,571 --> 00:41:09,007
Get your feet back on the ground

407
00:41:09,074 --> 00:41:14,011
And your head out of the clouds above

408
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:16,610
My friend. now listen to me

409
00:41:16,949 --> 00:41:21,909
Take it slow
'Cause there's something you should know

410
00:41:23,622 --> 00:41:28,525
Angels never fall in love

411
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:33,988
Fall in love

412
00:41:39,104 --> 00:41:42,699
So if she flies away today

413
00:41:42,775 --> 00:41:46,802
Don't feel too bad. and don't be sad
It's just as well

414
00:41:47,112 --> 00:41:49,603
You know. where angels go

415
00:41:51,583 --> 00:41:53,483
trouble follows

416
00:41:54,987 --> 00:41:59,856
Trouble follows

417
00:42:05,798 --> 00:42:08,631
- Sister Celestine. Celestine!
- Yes, Mother.

418
00:42:10,269 --> 00:42:13,602
Where did our girls
get those things they're wearing?

419
00:42:13,672 --> 00:42:17,574
- They must have shortened them, Mother.
- Your girls look wonderful, Mother.

420
00:42:17,643 --> 00:42:22,205
- This is a night my boys will never forget.
- Neither will I.

421
00:42:28,253 --> 00:42:31,245
- Interesting art form, don't you think?
- Very.

422
00:42:34,493 --> 00:42:36,256
Remarkable likeness.

423
00:42:36,361 --> 00:42:38,761
They're only paper boxes, Mother.

424
00:42:39,064 --> 00:42:42,033
Good. So disposable.

425
00:42:46,672 --> 00:42:50,836
- You certainly run a swinging school.
- We try.

426
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:55,409
We should have a dance like this
at the end of each term.

427
00:42:55,481 --> 00:42:59,747
I know our Bishop would approve.
He's really responsible for our being here.

428
00:42:59,818 --> 00:43:02,116
- Isn't that right, Mother?
- Yes.

429
00:43:03,755 --> 00:43:05,086
Bless him.

430
00:43:05,257 --> 00:43:10,217
Trouble follows

431
00:43:43,395 --> 00:43:44,760
All clear.

432
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:02,473
- How about it?
- Don't blow your cool, she's working on it.

433
00:44:22,501 --> 00:44:23,900
Almost done.

434
00:44:49,161 --> 00:44:51,254
Here's the formula. Pay up.

435
00:44:51,597 --> 00:44:54,225
- You turn me off.
- So who wants you on?

436
00:44:55,834 --> 00:44:56,994
Come on, split!

437
00:45:03,976 --> 00:45:07,434
Pete, I'm stuck in the laundry chute! Help!

438
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:27,227
Good morning, Father.

439
00:45:27,833 --> 00:45:31,200
Now, don't tell me
you slept in that chair all night?

440
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:35,338
- I did.
- Don't you trust your girls, Mother?

441
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:41,545
Of course.
Just as much as you trust your boys.

442
00:45:45,417 --> 00:45:48,386
- Breakfast?
- I could use a cup of tea.

443
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:04,132
Goodbye.

444
00:46:04,202 --> 00:46:06,329
Don't forget to write, okay?

445
00:46:09,007 --> 00:46:10,838
It's been very interesting.

446
00:46:10,909 --> 00:46:13,377
I hope someday
you and your boys will visit us.

447
00:46:13,445 --> 00:46:16,573
- I'll bet you do.
- Father?

448
00:46:17,282 --> 00:46:20,410
I hope I can find you at the Pray-In
in Washington next month.

449
00:46:20,485 --> 00:46:22,612
Just look for me. I'll be wearing black.

450
00:46:22,688 --> 00:46:25,088
- More like red.
- What was that, Mother?

451
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:27,955
I said, we're ready to go, Father.
Thank you again.

452
00:46:28,026 --> 00:46:31,826
- Have a good trip. I'll pray for you.
- And I'll pray for you.

453
00:46:32,097 --> 00:46:33,689
Somebody better.

454
00:46:34,499 --> 00:46:36,694
If there's gonna be a happening,
it better happen.

455
00:46:36,768 --> 00:46:38,133
It sure better.

456
00:46:40,372 --> 00:46:41,771
It's groovy.

457
00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:48,545
Rosabelle! Marvel Ann!
The bomb worked great!

458
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:53,776
Rosabelle, don't you want your money?

459
00:46:53,852 --> 00:46:56,844
Reverend Mother, would you give
this to Rosabelle and Marvel Ann?

460
00:46:56,922 --> 00:46:59,789
You give it to Father Chase
to replace the broken window.

461
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:02,486
- But they deserve it.
- Don't you worry.

462
00:47:02,561 --> 00:47:04,961
I'll give them what they deserve.

463
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:11,803
You mean, we're supposed to wash
the whole bus, Reverend Mother?

464
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:14,498
From bumper to bumper.

465
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:17,570
But it's such a big bus, Reverend Mother.

466
00:47:17,642 --> 00:47:19,872
Yes, isn't it?

467
00:47:45,871 --> 00:47:48,032
- It's all hooked up.
- Maybe we ought to wait...

468
00:47:48,106 --> 00:47:50,802
- till the man gets back from lunch.
- It'll be too late.

469
00:47:50,876 --> 00:47:52,241
We'll leave the money for him.

470
00:47:52,310 --> 00:47:54,972
But you've never worked
anything like this before.

471
00:47:55,046 --> 00:47:57,537
You have never driven a bus before.

472
00:47:59,017 --> 00:48:03,283
Come on, hurry. It's a cinch.
Any 5- year- old could work this thing.

473
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,625
Here we go!

474
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:22,163
This is a ball!

475
00:48:35,654 --> 00:48:37,315
Close the windows!

476
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:42,487
Marvel Ann, close the windows!

477
00:48:52,571 --> 00:48:53,697
Help!

478
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:07,280
- Close the windows!
- I can't!

479
00:49:22,701 --> 00:49:23,827
Help!

480
00:50:00,705 --> 00:50:03,606
How did you miss out on this caper, Sister?

481
00:51:21,386 --> 00:51:25,789
If the gas gauge read empty, why didn't you
fill up at the last town, Sister?

482
00:51:25,857 --> 00:51:29,884
When it read empty in the old bus,
there was still five gallons in the tank.

483
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:31,952
I understood the old bus.

484
00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:36,833
I'd appreciate it if you established
a similar rapport with the new bus.

485
00:51:36,901 --> 00:51:40,962
Please see if you can flag down a motorist
and get some help.

486
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:44,002
- Yes, Mother.
- I'll go with you, Sister.

487
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:48,973
Do we have any more cold drinks
for the girls?

488
00:51:49,047 --> 00:51:53,074
No, but we've plenty of hot ones.
The ice melted.

489
00:51:54,285 --> 00:51:58,551
- I said that we should use dry ice.
- Chemicals are unhealthy.

490
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:00,522
So is dying of thirst.

491
00:52:01,059 --> 00:52:05,655
And incidentally, if we pull these skirts up
to an intelligent length...

492
00:52:05,897 --> 00:52:08,798
we might stand a fighting chance
of surviving this heat.

493
00:52:08,867 --> 00:52:10,528
And show our legs?

494
00:52:11,770 --> 00:52:14,671
Why, it's no secret we have legs,
is it, Sister?

495
00:52:14,739 --> 00:52:18,038
If we had any sense,
we'd get rid of this medieval garb...

496
00:52:18,109 --> 00:52:21,340
and get into something nice and cool
and drip- dry.

497
00:52:21,546 --> 00:52:23,343
Drip- dry nuns?

498
00:52:24,449 --> 00:52:27,384
Did you hear what she said, Mother?
Drip- dry.

499
00:52:27,652 --> 00:52:30,951
In this heat,
I wouldn't mind being drip-dry myself.

500
00:53:08,927 --> 00:53:10,827
Let me, Mother, please.

501
00:53:11,262 --> 00:53:14,891
- Little bird's got trouble.
- So help them, man. Help them.

502
00:53:14,966 --> 00:53:18,333
You're sending loud and clear, baby.
Loud and clear.

503
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:21,637
But you're getting the wrong message.

504
00:53:21,706 --> 00:53:23,799
Get back to the bus, girls.

505
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:27,878
Man, it's a penguin.

506
00:53:29,147 --> 00:53:32,275
- Is she for real, man?
- So ask her, man.

507
00:53:33,918 --> 00:53:35,385
You for real?

508
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:38,779
Yes, I'm for real.

509
00:53:38,857 --> 00:53:41,951
Ain't you hot
in them weird black threads, lady?

510
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:45,393
No hotter than you are
in those weird black threads.

511
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:56,606
- You got a big mouth, lady.
- And you have a big knife.

512
00:53:57,542 --> 00:54:00,636
But that doesn't necessarily
make you a big man.

513
00:54:27,438 --> 00:54:30,236
- Cool it.
- What for, man?

514
00:54:30,441 --> 00:54:32,102
Because I said so.

515
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:48,349
You shouldn't get him mad, lady.
I mean, he's a real bad boy.

516
00:54:50,261 --> 00:54:52,354
Bad boys don't frighten me.

517
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:56,861
Especially when they have to carry knives
to give them courage.

518
00:54:56,935 --> 00:55:00,268
- I bet you don't carry a knife.
- How would you know that, lady?

519
00:55:00,338 --> 00:55:02,533
Because obviously, you're the leader...

520
00:55:02,607 --> 00:55:06,509
and a leader doesn't need guns or knives
to give him authority.

521
00:55:06,778 --> 00:55:08,871
His weapon is intelligence.

522
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:13,148
You know what? You're right.
But now tell me something.

523
00:55:14,085 --> 00:55:18,488
You were real scared, weren't you,
when you saw the knife coming at you?

524
00:55:18,590 --> 00:55:23,186
You'd like for me to say that I was,
because if I was scared...

525
00:55:23,261 --> 00:55:27,698
then what I am and what I believe in
really isn't all that great. Right?

526
00:55:30,435 --> 00:55:32,460
Okay. So, you're smart.

527
00:55:33,104 --> 00:55:36,005
But I still want to know. Were you scared?

528
00:55:37,141 --> 00:55:40,941
Let's just say
that I feared for my mortal life...

529
00:55:41,012 --> 00:55:43,572
but not for my immortal soul.

530
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:50,547
Crazy.

531
00:55:56,427 --> 00:55:58,588
Sister George.

532
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:04,702
Here's the money for the gas.

533
00:56:04,769 --> 00:56:07,636
I'll offer it to him, Mother,
but I doubt if he'll take it.

534
00:56:07,705 --> 00:56:08,831
Sister George.

535
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:12,638
I still don't understand how
you got them to do this for us.

536
00:56:12,977 --> 00:56:14,569
We communicated.

537
00:57:12,270 --> 00:57:14,704
It's flat, all right. I have to change it.

538
00:57:14,772 --> 00:57:18,469
Don't be ridiculous, Sister.
You can't handle that monster.

539
00:57:21,679 --> 00:57:25,206
Out of gas,
a flat tire in the middle of nowhere...

540
00:57:26,751 --> 00:57:28,082
What next?

541
00:57:29,921 --> 00:57:34,119
Maybe there's a town or a ranch somewhere.
I'll start walking. Maybe I can get a lift.

542
00:57:34,192 --> 00:57:38,959
We haven't seen a car in the last half- hour.
You couldn't possibly walk in this heat.

543
00:57:52,443 --> 00:57:54,877
Doesn't anyone live in New Mexico?

544
00:58:02,286 --> 00:58:04,982
Mother, she can't do that.
She just can't do that.

545
00:58:05,056 --> 00:58:07,047
I mean, it's humiliating.

546
00:58:07,191 --> 00:58:08,988
Humiliating, my foot.

547
00:58:09,427 --> 00:58:13,261
It's the way the Blessed Virgin rode
into Bethlehem, isn't it?

548
00:58:13,431 --> 00:58:14,420
Giddyup.

549
00:59:12,323 --> 00:59:14,587
There she blows. Help's coming!

550
00:59:38,716 --> 00:59:40,240
How do, ladies?

551
00:59:46,657 --> 00:59:48,386
Ride them, cowboys!

552
00:59:54,332 --> 00:59:55,765
Go get them!

553
00:59:56,367 --> 00:59:58,835
How many of those boys
are your sons, Mr. Farriday?

554
00:59:58,903 --> 01:00:02,999
- Only six of them.
- What a lovely family.

555
01:00:03,474 --> 01:00:07,672
- You must be a Catholic, Mr. Farriday.
- No, ma'am. Baptist.

556
01:00:08,012 --> 01:00:11,311
But we Baptists
are kind of partial to begetting, too.

557
01:00:11,382 --> 01:00:13,247
- Right, Sister?
- Right.

558
01:00:13,384 --> 01:00:15,215
Mr. Farriday enlightened me...

559
01:00:15,286 --> 01:00:18,346
on so many things
on our drive back to the bus.

560
01:00:23,361 --> 01:00:26,353
It's very kind of you
to put us up for the night, Mr. Farriday.

561
01:00:26,430 --> 01:00:27,692
It's my pleasure.

562
01:00:27,765 --> 01:00:30,131
You wouldn't have made Flagstaff
till midnight.

563
01:00:30,201 --> 01:00:33,659
There's a lot of lonely highway
between here and there.

564
01:00:42,246 --> 01:00:44,237
Marvel Ann, look at that.

565
01:01:03,367 --> 01:01:05,665
Get that horse. Look at him go!

566
01:01:11,242 --> 01:01:15,235
Reckon I have to get you
an itty- bitty pony and cart, Juddie boy.

567
01:01:31,729 --> 01:01:33,924
Rosabelle, what's eating you?

568
01:01:38,803 --> 01:01:41,636
Rosabelle! How about this?

569
01:01:58,389 --> 01:02:00,289
That was pretty stupid.

570
01:02:00,358 --> 01:02:03,350
Acting like a goon
isn't going to break up that romance.

571
01:02:03,461 --> 01:02:06,658
- Now, if you take my advice- -
- I'd rather take poison.

572
01:02:06,731 --> 01:02:10,189
Temper, temper.
I'm just giving you the facts of life.

573
01:02:10,401 --> 01:02:14,997
Don't you know friendship
flies out the window when love flies in?

574
01:02:15,239 --> 01:02:17,833
Why don't you crawl back under your rock?

575
01:02:18,643 --> 01:02:21,407
I tried. That's my good deed for the day.

576
01:02:21,479 --> 01:02:24,004
And that's my good deed for the day!

577
01:02:32,123 --> 01:02:35,286
Hey, Rosabelle,
they got the greatest goats here!

578
01:02:35,426 --> 01:02:37,257
Come on, I'll show you!

579
01:02:37,828 --> 01:02:39,295
Later, maybe.

580
01:02:48,172 --> 01:02:52,108
- Aren't they adorable?
- Turn purple.

581
01:02:53,277 --> 01:02:55,802
It'd be better than turning green with envy.

582
01:02:55,880 --> 01:03:00,146
After all, Rosabelle can't help it
if she's gorgeous and irresistible.

583
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:03,047
- Bye.
- Drop dead.

584
01:03:18,536 --> 01:03:20,299
Help!

585
01:03:32,683 --> 01:03:35,117
Somebody, please help!

586
01:04:19,463 --> 01:04:23,126
Are you still in bed?
You've already missed half the party.

587
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:26,192
- I'm not going.
- Of course you're going.

588
01:04:26,937 --> 01:04:31,533
Why, the doctor said you were fine.
Come on, get up and get dressed.

589
01:04:32,676 --> 01:04:34,507
The boys are going to give you a prize...

590
01:04:34,578 --> 01:04:38,014
for the best broncobuster
this side of the Rio Grande.

591
01:04:38,649 --> 01:04:42,085
Hey, it's a great party.
You don't want to miss it, do you?

592
01:04:53,697 --> 01:04:56,029
Do you want to tell me about it?

593
01:04:59,870 --> 01:05:02,361
It'll all be forgotten
by the time we get to the rally.

594
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:05,841
- I'm not going to the rally.
- Of course you are.

595
01:05:06,043 --> 01:05:09,774
No. I'm going to call my father tomorrow
and tell him.

596
01:05:11,015 --> 01:05:13,381
He'll fix it for me to meet him somewhere.

597
01:05:13,451 --> 01:05:16,215
Marvel Ann, that's ridiculous.

598
01:05:19,323 --> 01:05:22,656
Maybe if we just talk about
what's bothering you...

599
01:05:23,227 --> 01:05:25,559
I mean, isn't that what friends are for?

600
01:05:25,629 --> 01:05:28,962
I don't know what friends are for.
And I don't need any.

601
01:05:29,033 --> 01:05:32,059
And you're not supposed
to be my friend, anyway.

602
01:05:32,136 --> 01:05:33,694
Marvel Ann, you don't mean that.

603
01:05:33,771 --> 01:05:36,331
I do. And I'm not going
to that stupid rally...

604
01:05:36,407 --> 01:05:39,672
and I don't want to talk about it,
especially to you.

605
01:05:39,743 --> 01:05:42,303
So go away, please! Just go away!

606
01:05:47,685 --> 01:05:48,879
Sister?

607
01:05:49,787 --> 01:05:53,086
- Yes?
- Can I talk to Reverend Mother, please?

608
01:05:53,157 --> 01:05:56,217
I mean, if she isn't busy,
and you can find her.

609
01:05:56,861 --> 01:05:58,158
Of course.

610
01:06:09,406 --> 01:06:10,737
Marvel Ann?

611
01:06:11,542 --> 01:06:13,635
I am sleeping.

612
01:06:14,311 --> 01:06:18,247
- I just wanted to tell you- -
- Kindly do not sit on my bed.

613
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:22,581
The slightest movement
gives me excruciating pain.

614
01:06:22,753 --> 01:06:24,118
I'm sorry.

615
01:06:24,488 --> 01:06:28,447
- I really am sorry, Marvel Ann.
- I don't know what for.

616
01:06:28,792 --> 01:06:32,751
I suppose you can't help it
if you're gorgeous and irresistible.

617
01:06:32,930 --> 01:06:33,954
What?

618
01:06:34,031 --> 01:06:37,489
I said, you can't help it
if you're gorgeous and irresistible!

619
01:06:37,568 --> 01:06:40,833
- Who said I'm gorgeous and irresistible?
- Everyone.

620
01:06:40,905 --> 01:06:42,964
- Well, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

621
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:46,237
In fact, I don't know why
anyone so gorgeous and irresistible...

622
01:06:46,310 --> 01:06:50,337
has anything to do with ugly, fat,
stupid, dopey old me!

623
01:06:50,648 --> 01:06:52,138
You're not stupid.

624
01:06:52,216 --> 01:06:55,242
- Just ugly and fat, right?
- I didn't say that.

625
01:06:55,553 --> 01:06:58,989
You're hopeless.
I don't even know why I came in here.

626
01:07:00,925 --> 01:07:03,291
Then why don't you go?

627
01:07:05,829 --> 01:07:09,822
I'll go when I want to go,
and I just don't happen to want to go.

628
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:14,869
- Nobody's asking you to be a martyr.
- If I want to be a martyr, I'll be a martyr.

629
01:07:15,172 --> 01:07:17,732
Nobody's going to tell me
not to be a martyr.

630
01:07:17,808 --> 01:07:19,435
As a matter of fact...

631
01:07:19,510 --> 01:07:23,173
if the pay weren't so bad, I'd probably
take up martyring for a profession.

632
01:07:23,247 --> 01:07:26,216
Saint Rosabelle! That'd be a kick.

633
01:07:26,650 --> 01:07:27,878
Don't knock it.

634
01:07:27,952 --> 01:07:31,149
You should be so lucky
to have a friend who's a saint.

635
01:07:31,221 --> 01:07:36,181
- Big deal! What's that make me?
- It makes you my best and dearest friend!

636
01:07:37,628 --> 01:07:38,652
Honest?

637
01:07:38,729 --> 01:07:41,254
Cross my heart
and hope to suffer all the fires of- -

638
01:07:41,332 --> 01:07:43,266
I believe you.

639
01:07:43,968 --> 01:07:45,799
Did I hurt your poor, broken body?

640
01:07:45,869 --> 01:07:49,771
It's not broken, just bent a little.
Come on, you can sit down.

641
01:07:52,743 --> 01:07:54,574
- Go ahead.
- No, you first.

642
01:07:55,279 --> 01:07:57,179
I only wanted to say...

643
01:07:59,016 --> 01:08:02,577
I was dumb to be jealous.
Real friends don't get jealous...

644
01:08:02,653 --> 01:08:06,851
just because their real friends happen
to be pretty and have a very high IQ.

645
01:08:06,924 --> 01:08:10,758
- Look, I know I'm kind of nothing- -
- You're not.

646
01:08:11,261 --> 01:08:14,196
You're the bravest,
most loyal person I know.

647
01:08:15,633 --> 01:08:18,830
And don't ever say again
that you're fat and ugly.

648
01:08:19,169 --> 01:08:21,694
- How about stupid?
- That you can say.

649
01:08:22,506 --> 01:08:24,599
- Stop crying.
- Who's crying?

650
01:08:25,009 --> 01:08:28,536
I happen to have a very advanced case
of soggy eyeballs.

651
01:08:29,179 --> 01:08:30,669
It's catching.

652
01:08:31,548 --> 01:08:33,743
- You know what?
- What?

653
01:08:34,018 --> 01:08:37,181
- I feel good.
- Me, too.

654
01:08:40,391 --> 01:08:42,552
You're behaving like a child, Sister.

655
01:08:42,626 --> 01:08:46,323
I'm sorry. But I just don't understand.

656
01:08:47,097 --> 01:08:50,294
I thought I was close to Marvel Ann,
to all the girls.

657
01:08:50,367 --> 01:08:53,461
And you are. Possibly
just a little too close.

658
01:08:53,971 --> 01:08:56,531
Perhaps that's why she felt
she couldn't confide in you.

659
01:08:56,607 --> 01:08:59,337
You see, Sister, you've put
yourself on the girls' level...

660
01:08:59,410 --> 01:09:01,878
and that's fine, but only to a point.

661
01:09:01,945 --> 01:09:05,540
Because if we, or their parents,
or adults generally, are on their level...

662
01:09:05,616 --> 01:09:08,744
then who are they going to go to
when they're really in trouble?

663
01:09:08,819 --> 01:09:11,652
Do you mean Marvel Ann
couldn't talk to me?

664
01:09:11,722 --> 01:09:13,747
Couldn't come to me for understanding?

665
01:09:13,824 --> 01:09:15,849
Sister, when a 4- year- old gets hurt...

666
01:09:15,926 --> 01:09:18,486
he doesn't go running to his friend
for consolation.

667
01:09:18,562 --> 01:09:22,555
- He goes crying home to mother.
- Marvel Ann isn't four years old.

668
01:09:22,833 --> 01:09:26,360
But she's still a child, and in that
respect, most of us remain children.

669
01:09:26,437 --> 01:09:30,874
She was hurt and upset, and she didn't
want a friend, she wanted a mother.

670
01:09:31,275 --> 01:09:34,369
- Are you saying I've failed with the girls?
- No.

671
01:09:35,079 --> 01:09:38,480
You're a smashing success
with the girls, on their level...

672
01:09:38,549 --> 01:09:41,143
and if you don't change,
that's where you'll remain.

673
01:09:41,218 --> 01:09:43,709
They need and want more than that from us.

674
01:09:43,787 --> 01:09:47,917
If it's wrong for me
to be on the same level with the girls...

675
01:09:48,358 --> 01:09:52,795
then it's equally wrong for you to be
so far above them you can't be reached.

676
01:09:52,896 --> 01:09:54,193
I know you're upset.

677
01:09:54,264 --> 01:09:58,701
You enjoy the nun mystique, don't you,
Mother, as it places you above the ordinary?

678
01:09:58,769 --> 01:10:02,205
- It makes you something special.
- Don't say things you'll regret.

679
01:10:02,272 --> 01:10:06,868
You resent me because I represent change,
and you don't want change.

680
01:10:10,547 --> 01:10:13,812
It's only natural to cling
to what one understands.

681
01:10:14,251 --> 01:10:16,913
Even if that understanding is limited?

682
01:10:17,354 --> 01:10:21,916
Nothing which remains static can survive!
That is the truth, Mother.

683
01:10:23,026 --> 01:10:25,893
And there are also some truths
you had better face, Sister.

684
01:10:25,963 --> 01:10:28,693
Like whether or not I'm fit to be a nun?

685
01:10:29,199 --> 01:10:31,793
I didn't pose the question, Sister.

686
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:34,498
You did.

687
01:10:35,439 --> 01:10:37,100
Now you answer it.

688
01:10:44,314 --> 01:10:46,248
Goodbye, Mr. Farriday.

689
01:10:47,751 --> 01:10:51,050
That's a beauty, Mr. Farriday.
I'll treasure it forever.

690
01:10:51,121 --> 01:10:52,418
Excuse me.

691
01:10:55,225 --> 01:10:58,524
Mr. Farriday, thank you very much
for everything.

692
01:11:32,763 --> 01:11:36,096
- Marvel Ann, are you okay?
- Sure.

693
01:11:37,334 --> 01:11:40,030
- You hear something?
- Like what?

694
01:11:41,138 --> 01:11:43,538
Like harps?

695
01:11:46,910 --> 01:11:49,708
I can't thank you enough
for all you've done, Mr. Farriday.

696
01:11:49,780 --> 01:11:52,044
It was my pleasure. And my boys'.

697
01:11:52,115 --> 01:11:54,845
They're wonderful boys.
You can be very proud of them.

698
01:11:54,918 --> 01:11:58,615
I wouldn't pin any halos on them.
I gave them a good talking-to yesterday.

699
01:11:58,689 --> 01:12:02,853
No horsing around, and not one word
that couldn't be said in church.

700
01:12:02,926 --> 01:12:06,623
You'd be surprised at some of the things
I've heard said in church.

701
01:12:06,730 --> 01:12:09,563
I guess us Baptists are more strait-laced.

702
01:12:10,234 --> 01:12:11,929
In church, I mean.

703
01:12:14,071 --> 01:12:16,437
Time to go. Thank you again, Mr. Farriday.

704
01:12:16,506 --> 01:12:19,771
- Have a good trip. You'll make it.
- I know we will.

705
01:12:23,146 --> 01:12:24,374
Goodbye.

706
01:13:00,817 --> 01:13:04,275
What in the world happened
between those two yesterday?

707
01:13:04,922 --> 01:13:07,584
- You've got Jud's address?
- I know. We'll write.

708
01:13:09,393 --> 01:13:12,658
One of them grew up
a little sooner than the other.

709
01:14:26,603 --> 01:14:28,833
I'm buying some moccasins, Mother.

710
01:14:28,905 --> 01:14:31,874
They'll be a nice change from your sneakers.

711
01:14:35,145 --> 01:14:38,239
This place has a fascinating
history, Mother.

712
01:14:38,415 --> 01:14:41,543
And the girls tell me
that there's a museum inside the post...

713
01:14:41,618 --> 01:14:43,677
full of old Indian relics.

714
01:14:44,221 --> 01:14:48,351
Let's you and I go see it
and add two more relics to the collection.

715
01:14:52,329 --> 01:14:54,797
- How do I look?
- Stupid.

716
01:15:01,738 --> 01:15:03,831
The man inside said that six priests...

717
01:15:03,907 --> 01:15:07,604
I mean, padres were massacred here
in 1680-something...

718
01:15:07,677 --> 01:15:10,237
and there's an old Pueblo ruin
only a mile from here.

719
01:15:10,313 --> 01:15:12,406
That's very interesting, Tanya.

720
01:15:22,993 --> 01:15:24,756
Excuse me a moment, Sister.

721
01:15:24,828 --> 01:15:26,420
Reverend Mother!

722
01:15:26,930 --> 01:15:31,492
I bought these for you, Reverend Mother.
They're made by the Tanos Indians.

723
01:15:32,402 --> 01:15:36,236
Thank you, dear.
They're just what I've always wanted.

724
01:15:36,306 --> 01:15:39,673
Would you put them in the bus
with the other treasures we've collected?

725
01:15:39,743 --> 01:15:41,836
All right, Reverend Mother.

726
01:15:50,487 --> 01:15:51,715
Mother.

727
01:15:52,556 --> 01:15:54,615
All gassed up and ready to go.

728
01:15:54,691 --> 01:15:58,252
All right. Gather the girls together.

729
01:15:58,462 --> 01:15:59,895
Yes, Mother.

730
01:16:08,105 --> 01:16:11,734
They've got some great rocks inside.
Can't we wait a bit for me to buy some?

731
01:16:11,808 --> 01:16:14,299
And I've got eight more pairs
of moccasins to buy.

732
01:16:14,377 --> 01:16:17,471
I promised the girls at school,
Reverend Mother. I promised.

733
01:16:24,554 --> 01:16:27,990
And promises are important.
Go ahead, girls.

734
01:16:28,058 --> 01:16:29,992
- Good.
- Thank you!

735
01:16:48,445 --> 01:16:51,608
How far out of the way
will the detour take us, Sister?

736
01:16:51,681 --> 01:16:53,273
About 125 miles.

737
01:16:55,652 --> 01:16:58,143
125 miles?

738
01:17:00,390 --> 01:17:04,622
We'll lose close to a day.
There are only two days left to the rally.

739
01:17:04,995 --> 01:17:08,123
The detour was plainly marked
on the TripTik.

740
01:17:08,198 --> 01:17:09,893
I don't know how I missed it.

741
01:17:09,966 --> 01:17:12,901
Well, I do. You had to do it all yourself.

742
01:17:12,969 --> 01:17:16,666
You wouldn't let me or anybody
help you with the maps or the TripTiks.

743
01:17:16,740 --> 01:17:20,574
They were your treasures.
Now look where you've gotten us. Nowhere.

744
01:17:20,744 --> 01:17:23,406
- That will do, Sister.
- I'm sorry, Mother.

745
01:17:23,513 --> 01:17:27,142
It's been a long, hard trip,
and anyone can make a mistake.

746
01:17:27,217 --> 01:17:31,017
Please get back in the bus
before you all have sunstroke.

747
01:17:31,922 --> 01:17:35,323
Sister George, I want to speak to you.

748
01:17:49,773 --> 01:17:52,401
- Sit down, Sister.
- I prefer to stand, Mother.

749
01:17:52,475 --> 01:17:55,000
I don't. So please sit down.

750
01:17:57,581 --> 01:18:00,573
I know you're upset about
what happened last night at the ranch.

751
01:18:00,650 --> 01:18:04,051
What happened last night
has nothing to do with this.

752
01:18:04,354 --> 01:18:07,915
I'm only concerned
with getting those girls to the rally.

753
01:18:08,658 --> 01:18:11,821
If we'd had a professional driver,
this never would have happened.

754
01:18:11,895 --> 01:18:14,455
I said we should have one
from the very beginning...

755
01:18:14,531 --> 01:18:16,931
that it was wrong
to let Sister Clarissa drive.

756
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:20,697
Sister Clarissa has been driving our bus
for over 20 years.

757
01:18:21,037 --> 01:18:25,497
She began at a time when very few of us
had the courage to even venture out alone.

758
01:18:25,575 --> 01:18:29,841
Since then it's been her responsibility,
and she gets great pleasure from it.

759
01:18:29,913 --> 01:18:32,177
Surely, you can understand that.

760
01:18:32,649 --> 01:18:36,779
I think Sister should be commended
for what she did 20 years ago.

761
01:18:37,387 --> 01:18:41,118
But she was not capable of making this trip,
and you know it.

762
01:18:41,992 --> 01:18:44,517
I could argue the point, but I won't.

763
01:18:45,462 --> 01:18:47,930
What's more important
is that replacing Sister...

764
01:18:47,998 --> 01:18:50,398
would have made her feel useless.

765
01:18:50,533 --> 01:18:54,731
And I cannot deny her the joy of giving,
no matter how small the gift.

766
01:18:54,804 --> 01:18:56,533
No concept or institution...

767
01:18:56,606 --> 01:19:00,633
which is indifferent to the needs
of the human spirit can survive.

768
01:19:01,711 --> 01:19:04,544
We must listen to the heart, too, Sister.

769
01:19:04,748 --> 01:19:07,546
Does that mean not facing reality?

770
01:19:08,685 --> 01:19:11,381
Does sentiment preclude common sense?

771
01:19:13,523 --> 01:19:18,460
I am not about to discuss philosophy,
dialectics, or the new look in the church...

772
01:19:19,229 --> 01:19:22,392
not in the middle of the desert
in 100 degree heat.

773
01:19:22,465 --> 01:19:24,194
Come along, Sister.

774
01:19:32,375 --> 01:19:33,933
Reverend Mother.

775
01:19:35,111 --> 01:19:37,579
- Do we know where we're going?
- We do.

776
01:19:37,647 --> 01:19:40,275
But only if we've led good Christian lives.

777
01:19:41,251 --> 01:19:43,651
I wasn't thinking that far ahead.

778
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:14,108
You know,
it may not be a total loss, Mother.

779
01:20:14,617 --> 01:20:17,017
We may get something out of this.

780
01:20:17,420 --> 01:20:20,685
If you mean broken bones,
I couldn't agree with you more.

781
01:20:20,757 --> 01:20:24,022
No, I mean the detour.
It could be very educational.

782
01:20:24,094 --> 01:20:26,790
We go right through an Indian reservation.

783
01:20:27,163 --> 01:20:30,724
- Wild Indians?
- I wouldn't worry about it, Sister.

784
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:33,963
There hasn't been an Indian uprising
in over 100 years.

785
01:21:04,601 --> 01:21:07,764
Stop the bus! Sister, stop the bus!

786
01:21:07,837 --> 01:21:09,668
Sit tight! We'll make it!

787
01:21:16,346 --> 01:21:18,109
This is ridiculous!

788
01:21:18,948 --> 01:21:20,142
Sister!

789
01:21:20,517 --> 01:21:22,985
Stop! No, sit down!

790
01:22:18,308 --> 01:22:21,835
What a scene! I'll win an award for this.
It's terrific.

791
01:22:22,412 --> 01:22:25,313
Beautiful, beautiful. That's it, keep going.

792
01:22:31,387 --> 01:22:32,945
Send more Indians in.

793
01:22:39,028 --> 01:22:42,191
Send more Indians in. Get on that set.
We have Indians, don't we?

794
01:23:24,674 --> 01:23:26,733
No!

795
01:23:28,444 --> 01:23:30,878
Cut!

796
01:23:39,188 --> 01:23:42,248
If I wanted a bus in my picture,
I would have put a bus in it!

797
01:23:42,325 --> 01:23:45,624
But this is 1855,
and the pioneers were very backward.

798
01:23:45,695 --> 01:23:46,923
Please stop shouting.

799
01:23:46,996 --> 01:23:49,590
We said we were sorry,
and we hope you'll forgive us.

800
01:23:49,699 --> 01:23:52,259
Forgive you? Absolution?

801
01:23:53,903 --> 01:23:56,235
She wants absolution from me?

802
01:23:57,373 --> 01:23:59,568
I'm not even a good Catholic.

803
01:23:59,976 --> 01:24:02,137
You're not even a good director!

804
01:24:02,812 --> 01:24:05,975
Mother, I saw his last picture,
and it was rotten!

805
01:24:06,749 --> 01:24:09,912
- You didn't like it?
- Like it? I wanted my money back.

806
01:24:09,986 --> 01:24:11,715
Please go back with the girls.

807
01:24:11,788 --> 01:24:13,779
Maybe you wanted your money back, too.

808
01:24:13,856 --> 01:24:15,949
But you decided to sabotage this picture?

809
01:24:16,025 --> 01:24:18,084
- That's ridiculous.
- It's not ridiculous.

810
01:24:18,361 --> 01:24:21,956
The Sister who drives the bus,
Sister Clarissa, simply panicked.

811
01:24:22,031 --> 01:24:25,330
She's highly imaginative,
and rather inexperienced in these matters.

812
01:24:25,401 --> 01:24:28,564
I'll bet she's inexperienced.
She should be locked up.

813
01:24:28,638 --> 01:24:30,970
Who is this Sister, Sister who?

814
01:24:35,178 --> 01:24:36,475
It's you.

815
01:24:37,347 --> 01:24:40,612
You're dangerous.
You don't know what you're doing.

816
01:24:40,683 --> 01:24:42,378
And neither do you.

817
01:24:44,687 --> 01:24:49,124
According to this pamphlet,
you are using the wrong Indians.

818
01:25:04,340 --> 01:25:06,740
- The wrong Indians?
- Yes.

819
01:25:07,276 --> 01:25:11,007
The Navajos were a peace- loving,
domestic people.

820
01:25:11,147 --> 01:25:15,413
And when this picture comes out,
I intend not to see it.

821
01:25:19,789 --> 01:25:23,156
You're a troublemaker.
All right, everybody, get back to work.

822
01:25:23,226 --> 01:25:26,024
And tell the wardrobe
to change the beads on the Indians.

823
01:25:26,095 --> 01:25:28,029
Don't stand there, get back to work!

824
01:25:28,464 --> 01:25:29,761
Move!

825
01:25:30,900 --> 01:25:32,765
Everybody's an authority.

826
01:25:32,835 --> 01:25:35,770
Everybody's a critic! Nuns, bus drivers...

827
01:25:37,573 --> 01:25:41,168
Sister Clarissa, please get all the girls
back in the bus. We're leaving.

828
01:25:41,244 --> 01:25:42,609
Not today.

829
01:25:43,546 --> 01:25:47,505
And we can forget about the rally.
We're not going to get there.

830
01:25:48,351 --> 01:25:51,047
We broke our axle fighting the Indians.

831
01:26:06,636 --> 01:26:09,867
- Careful. Watch your step, Mother.
- Thank you.

832
01:26:09,939 --> 01:26:12,237
- Be careful.
- Thank you so much.

833
01:26:14,911 --> 01:26:19,507
- It must be wonderful to be so creative.
- Thank you. You're very kind.

834
01:26:19,582 --> 01:26:23,882
I never realized how difficult it is
to make a film. I'm so impressed.

835
01:26:24,420 --> 01:26:26,911
You're a very remarkable man.

836
01:26:28,791 --> 01:26:31,225
That's very sweet of you, Mother.

837
01:26:31,394 --> 01:26:34,090
Why're you all standing here?
You must be terribly hungry.

838
01:26:34,163 --> 01:26:37,929
Why don't you go over to the catering truck
and have a bite? Be my guest.

839
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:41,868
Why, that's most gracious of you.
Don't let me take you from your work.

840
01:26:41,938 --> 01:26:45,931
- I've taken up enough of your time.
- It's been my pleasure, Mother.

841
01:26:49,345 --> 01:26:50,676
You heard what he said.

842
01:26:50,747 --> 01:26:53,545
We're welcome to
this nice gentleman's hospitality.

843
01:26:53,616 --> 01:26:56,779
Unless you'd just rather stand around
for the next two hours...

844
01:26:56,853 --> 01:26:59,822
because that's how long it's going to take
to fix the bus.

845
01:27:04,627 --> 01:27:08,119
Now gather up the other girls
and get something to eat.

846
01:27:15,037 --> 01:27:17,528
Come along, girls. They're serving lunch.

847
01:27:20,109 --> 01:27:23,101
It seems we're going
to make the rally after all.

848
01:27:23,179 --> 01:27:24,669
Yes, I heard.

849
01:27:24,981 --> 01:27:27,449
Aren't you pleased? I know I am.

850
01:27:28,017 --> 01:27:30,008
I don't understand why...

851
01:27:30,486 --> 01:27:33,614
aside from the fact
you don't want the girls to be disappointed.

852
01:27:33,689 --> 01:27:37,090
That's a very good reason,
but it's not the only one.

853
01:27:37,593 --> 01:27:41,552
- I want to get to that rally, too.
- I find that hard to believe.

854
01:27:43,533 --> 01:27:47,060
You've been opposed to the rally
from the very beginning.

855
01:27:47,170 --> 01:27:49,195
I did have my reservations.

856
01:27:49,272 --> 01:27:52,173
But it's proven
to be a wonderful experience.

857
01:27:52,308 --> 01:27:54,902
And in many ways, I have you to thank.

858
01:28:00,783 --> 01:28:02,546
You're thanking me?

859
01:28:04,387 --> 01:28:07,151
After all your objections to my ideas...

860
01:28:10,293 --> 01:28:13,285
and after questioning
my fitness to be a nun?

861
01:28:15,464 --> 01:28:18,900
I only voiced
your doubts and your thoughts, Sister.

862
01:28:19,435 --> 01:28:21,232
And if I spoke to you in anger...

863
01:28:21,304 --> 01:28:24,831
it was because
I was also questioning myself.

864
01:28:28,778 --> 01:28:31,303
Self- examination is always painful...

865
01:28:32,615 --> 01:28:34,173
and disturbing.

866
01:28:38,454 --> 01:28:41,514
I know now the cloister
isn't always a place.

867
01:28:41,657 --> 01:28:43,716
It can be a state of mind.

868
01:28:45,695 --> 01:28:48,528
And if I can't get out of that cloister...

869
01:28:49,232 --> 01:28:52,497
it's time I got out of St. Francis
and let someone else take over...

870
01:28:52,568 --> 01:28:56,664
who can equip our children
for the kind of life they have to live.

871
01:28:58,407 --> 01:29:01,843
- Mother, you can't mean that.
- Now, Sister...

872
01:29:02,845 --> 01:29:06,144
if you were planning
to be charitable to me, don't.

873
01:29:07,383 --> 01:29:09,578
It would be out of character.

874
01:29:12,922 --> 01:29:14,446
I just think...

875
01:29:15,157 --> 01:29:18,991
that it took more courage
for you to say what you just said...

876
01:29:19,495 --> 01:29:23,397
than it would take for me
to march in 100 picket lines.

877
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:27,367
If you leave St. Francis,
it'll be over my dead body.

878
01:29:29,171 --> 01:29:32,265
I know you, and what you are...

879
01:29:33,576 --> 01:29:36,943
and if you leave,
Lord knows who'll take your place.

880
01:29:37,346 --> 01:29:40,179
I just couldn't go through all this again.

881
01:29:42,818 --> 01:29:45,309
Damn, I can't find my handkerchief.

882
01:29:46,355 --> 01:29:47,549
Sister...

883
01:29:49,392 --> 01:29:53,351
- please watch your language.
- Yes, Mother. Thank you.

884
01:29:56,265 --> 01:29:57,562
Mother...

885
01:30:00,636 --> 01:30:03,867
- would you tell me something?
- I'll try.

886
01:30:05,474 --> 01:30:08,341
How did you get that man to do this for us?

887
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:12,907
We communicated.

888
01:30:23,259 --> 01:30:26,490
OK, I owe you two bits, but how did
you know they were going to make up?

889
01:30:26,562 --> 01:30:29,292
Because adults always unite
against the common enemy.

890
01:30:29,365 --> 01:30:30,957
- What enemy?
- Us.

891
01:30:38,107 --> 01:30:41,099
Well, we forded the rivers
and crossed the mountains...

892
01:30:41,177 --> 01:30:45,011
and fought off the Indians.
But we made it to the rally. all right.

893
01:30:45,081 --> 01:30:48,312
And it was worth everything
we went through to get there.

894
01:30:48,384 --> 01:30:51,478
It opened our eyes. and our hearts.
and our minds.

895
01:30:51,754 --> 01:30:54,621
But what's more important. we got involved.

896
01:30:54,690 --> 01:30:57,420
Not just in caring.
because we've always cared...

897
01:30:57,493 --> 01:30:58,983
but in doing.

898
01:30:59,161 --> 01:31:03,120
Though Sister George and I
haven't resolved all of our differences...

899
01:31:03,199 --> 01:31:07,067
there is a good. stiff breeze
blowing through St. Francis.

900
01:31:07,570 --> 01:31:11,301
And you'll see we have changed
some of our habits.
