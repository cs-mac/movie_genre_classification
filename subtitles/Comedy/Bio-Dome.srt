1
00:00:02,521 --> 00:00:03,821
All right, everybody,

2
00:00:03,857 --> 00:00:05,456
let's go ahead and start to shut up.

3
00:00:05,491 --> 00:00:07,291
We're gonna jump right
in on the one subject

4
00:00:07,327 --> 00:00:09,193
that brings me a little
bit of joy in Toledo

5
00:00:09,229 --> 00:00:10,796
where I find myself currently trapped...

6
00:00:10,941 --> 00:00:12,774
Taking down my rival Miles.

7
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:14,343
Now, I had a pretty good idea.

8
00:00:14,378 --> 00:00:16,277
I was thinking maybe we
could hack into his Tesla.

9
00:00:16,312 --> 00:00:18,013
How hard would that be?
I know it's possible.

10
00:00:18,048 --> 00:00:19,243
You think you guys could do that,

11
00:00:19,243 --> 00:00:20,407
or are you guys the kinda nerds

12
00:00:20,407 --> 00:00:21,547
that are good at computers,

13
00:00:21,547 --> 00:00:22,646
or are you the kinda nerds

14
00:00:22,681 --> 00:00:24,182
that smell bad and wear capes?

15
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:32,525
Uh, you know what? Let's
go ahead a pin in that,

16
00:00:32,561 --> 00:00:34,695
because a cute girl who
actually meets my standards

17
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,426
has swiped right on me.

18
00:00:36,481 --> 00:00:38,048
I don't know if you guys
know what that means,

19
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:40,416
but basically, it just means
that it's... it's bang time.

20
00:00:41,395 --> 00:00:44,192
Is it going to be happening
here in front of us?

21
00:00:44,192 --> 00:00:45,753
No, Anthony, it's not gonna be happening

22
00:00:45,753 --> 00:00:47,152
in front of you, you little freak!

23
00:00:47,187 --> 00:00:48,489
No, we're gonna go get a drink.

24
00:00:48,489 --> 00:00:49,922
Guys, gotta say...

25
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:51,831
I got a really good feeling about this one.

26
00:00:51,856 --> 00:00:53,161
Can I get a "get some"?

27
00:00:53,161 --> 00:00:54,299
Get some!

28
00:00:54,762 --> 00:00:56,598
That's my girl! All right!

29
00:00:57,247 --> 00:00:59,541
Um... see ya, dudes.

30
00:01:03,672 --> 00:01:05,238
<i>One, two, three, four!</i>

31
00:01:18,638 --> 00:01:20,464
<i>Now boarding for New York city.</i>

32
00:01:39,073 --> 00:01:41,255
Whoo!

33
00:01:51,107 --> 00:01:52,807
If it's on my license, you know,

34
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,369
they're not gonna want to save me.

35
00:01:54,404 --> 00:01:55,604
- No.
- They're gonna wanna

36
00:01:55,639 --> 00:01:56,763
- harvest my organs.
- Yes!

37
00:01:56,763 --> 00:01:58,115
That's what they want, they want my organs.

38
00:01:58,115 --> 00:02:00,249
Yes, exactly. And I am
not gonna die on the table

39
00:02:00,283 --> 00:02:02,984
so some drunk slob can get my liver.

40
00:02:03,019 --> 00:02:04,385
No, no, no. No, that's not fair.

41
00:02:04,421 --> 00:02:05,753
- No!
- You should have your liver.

42
00:02:05,788 --> 00:02:07,555
It's very good. It's pristine.

43
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,103
- Yeah, exactly.
- Nice...

44
00:02:14,822 --> 00:02:17,490
So, you wanna... head up to your place?

45
00:02:18,493 --> 00:02:20,726
I really like you, Jack.

46
00:02:20,761 --> 00:02:23,480
I just... I just wanna get to
know you a little bit better.

47
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,487
Yeah, sure. More dates.

48
00:02:27,061 --> 00:02:28,212
I'm around.

49
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:29,533
Cool. Good night.

50
00:02:29,533 --> 00:02:30,572
Good night.

51
00:02:37,784 --> 00:02:39,742
Wake up. We're in Toledo.

52
00:02:39,777 --> 00:02:41,155
Time to go to work.

53
00:02:43,146 --> 00:02:44,660
<i>Now boarding for Cleveland...</i>

54
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:49,418
Okeydokey, Principal Durbin.

55
00:02:49,418 --> 00:02:50,917
Here are your daily announcements.

56
00:02:50,952 --> 00:02:52,885
- Thank you, Helen.
- You're welcome.

57
00:02:52,921 --> 00:02:54,721
Betty bought butter but the
butter was bitter, so Betty

58
00:02:54,756 --> 00:02:56,323
bought better butter to make
the bitter butter better.

59
00:02:56,358 --> 00:02:57,462
Ah.

60
00:02:59,094 --> 00:03:01,903
The Magazine Drive ends Friday.

61
00:03:03,729 --> 00:03:05,128
O... kay. Oh!

62
00:03:05,163 --> 00:03:06,986
Oh! Text from Jack.

63
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:09,887
"Running late. Can you
cover for me,<i> bud?"</i>

64
00:03:10,193 --> 00:03:11,971
Called me bud. Helen, you gotta

65
00:03:12,064 --> 00:03:13,847
do the announcements
just this one time, okay?

66
00:03:13,847 --> 00:03:15,580
Oh, no, I can't do that.

67
00:03:15,614 --> 00:03:17,147
I get way too nervous.

68
00:03:17,182 --> 00:03:19,466
I-I was in my cousin's wedding,

69
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:21,585
and if you've never fainted

70
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,454
mouth-first onto a candle...

71
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:25,088
it was a nightmare.

72
00:03:25,123 --> 00:03:27,217
I-I actually ate fire.

73
00:03:27,242 --> 00:03:29,475
No, I can't... I can't do that.

74
00:03:29,511 --> 00:03:31,339
Just read off the paper.
It'll be fine, okay?

75
00:03:31,339 --> 00:03:32,940
It'll be so easy.

76
00:03:37,679 --> 00:03:39,412
Jack! You look really bad.

77
00:03:39,447 --> 00:03:42,082
Yeah. Had a... bit of
a rough one last night.

78
00:03:42,117 --> 00:03:43,950
- I had a date in New York.
- Again?

79
00:03:43,986 --> 00:03:45,819
"Ooh, look at me. I'm Jack.

80
00:03:45,854 --> 00:03:47,920
I'm too good for Toledo women."

81
00:03:47,955 --> 00:03:49,955
Well I'm glad you understand.

82
00:03:49,991 --> 00:03:52,825
Look, maybe taking a bus
to New York isn't ideal,

83
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,560
but it's worth it to date a woman

84
00:03:54,596 --> 00:03:56,162
who doesn't believe in angels.

85
00:03:56,197 --> 00:03:58,130
- They're watching over us.
- They help us.

86
00:03:58,166 --> 00:03:59,737
- Don't hate on an...
- You know what?

87
00:03:59,737 --> 00:04:01,404
Wouldn't it be easier
to just come to the bar

88
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,844
with us tonight?

89
00:04:02,844 --> 00:04:04,444
Come on.

90
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:06,411
Yeah, sure, maybe I should just go ahead

91
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:08,547
and alienate all of my core principles

92
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,482
and date in Toledo. While I'm at it,

93
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:12,216
maybe I can eat pie on the toilet.

94
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,652
- I've done that.
- Okay, see,

95
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:15,395
- don't disrespect pie.
- That's disgusting!

96
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,353
Good morning, Whitlock High.

97
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:21,699
It's your daily announcements.

98
00:04:26,329 --> 00:04:28,632
<i>It's Meatloaf Day in the cafeteria.</i>

99
00:04:28,941 --> 00:04:30,957
There will be a vegetarian option.

100
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,052
Too bad there's not an edible option.

101
00:04:34,981 --> 00:04:36,715
Oh. Thank you.

102
00:04:37,857 --> 00:04:40,176
<i>Creamed spinach will also be served.</i>

103
00:04:41,124 --> 00:04:43,487
<i>And for dessert... Violent illness.</i>

104
00:04:44,823 --> 00:04:46,490
<i>- Salmonella pie.</i>
- Oh!

105
00:04:47,793 --> 00:04:49,493
<i>The green apple two-trot.</i>

106
00:04:50,696 --> 00:04:52,829
That's... funny. That... Okay.

107
00:04:52,865 --> 00:04:54,464
And now, a special guest

108
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,392
to make your morning announcement.

109
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,037
<i>This is Coach Novak.</i>

110
00:05:00,071 --> 00:05:02,371
<i>There's gonna be
immediate suspension</i>

111
00:05:02,407 --> 00:05:04,672
<i>if anybody's gawking at pornography.</i>

112
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:08,120
Ha ha. She's really bustin' my chops.

113
00:05:11,985 --> 00:05:13,952
<i>Hey, guys, this was a real kick.</i>

114
00:05:14,245 --> 00:05:16,046
<i>Don't tell anybody that I, you know,</i>

115
00:05:16,046 --> 00:05:17,346
<i>went over my... Aah!</i>

116
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,265
Oh!

117
00:05:22,313 --> 00:05:24,452
Wow. I always thought announcements were...

118
00:05:24,487 --> 00:05:26,286
a way to impart vital information,

119
00:05:26,322 --> 00:05:27,886
but I guess what people like more

120
00:05:27,886 --> 00:05:30,186
are dumb... stupid dumb jokes.

121
00:05:30,221 --> 00:05:32,088
Okay, everybody, I'm here.

122
00:05:32,235 --> 00:05:33,534
Thank you so much for covering.

123
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,036
I really appreciate it. You're the best.

124
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,949
Best? The best at<i> what?</i>

125
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,946
He is an odd little duck.

126
00:05:39,971 --> 00:05:41,741
- So, did you get some?
- Did I get some?

127
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,947
Oh, my God, Heather, thank you for asking,

128
00:05:43,982 --> 00:05:45,515
but, no, I did not get any.

129
00:05:45,551 --> 00:05:47,417
I been commuting to
New York to go on dates,

130
00:05:47,453 --> 00:05:49,353
which is a little bit
complicated, to say the least.

131
00:05:49,388 --> 00:05:51,421
But now, for practical
reasons, I find myself

132
00:05:51,457 --> 00:05:52,689
considering dating in Toledo.

133
00:05:52,725 --> 00:05:54,391
Uh, at the risk of being contrary,

134
00:05:54,426 --> 00:05:57,078
haven't you already dated in Toledo?

135
00:05:57,543 --> 00:05:59,534
Doesn't your high school
ex-girlfriend live here?

136
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:01,191
Oh, look. It's you.

137
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:03,371
Wonderful. Good to see you, Marcus. Yes.

138
00:06:03,371 --> 00:06:05,183
Meredith is the exception, you know.

139
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:07,064
But there's always gonna be an exception.

140
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,566
You see, sophisticated New York women,

141
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:09,868
they're really more my type.

142
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:11,426
You guys know what type is, right?

143
00:06:11,475 --> 00:06:12,674
Victor, what's your type?

144
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,008
- Huh?
- Your type.

145
00:06:14,044 --> 00:06:15,470
Who would you wanna get with?

146
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:18,131
Like... if I could marry anyone?

147
00:06:18,156 --> 00:06:20,355
Yeah, sure, man. Whatever.

148
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,617
Just say who it is.

149
00:06:21,617 --> 00:06:23,417
- I don't wanna say.
- Why not?

150
00:06:23,834 --> 00:06:26,034
Oh... is it something
weird? Is it like somebody

151
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,376
- in your family?
- No!

152
00:06:27,376 --> 00:06:29,075
Is it a big doll? You
could just say who it is,

153
00:06:29,111 --> 00:06:31,111
or I could just keep guessing.
Is it your sister?

154
00:06:31,146 --> 00:06:33,448
- It's her.
- Oh. Cool.

155
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:35,221
It's somebody who's... in the room.

156
00:06:35,253 --> 00:06:36,560
That's great. We can follow up.

157
00:06:36,595 --> 00:06:38,337
Grace, do you like Victor?

158
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,132
No! That's too bad.

159
00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:42,634
But you know what, it's gotta feel good

160
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,070
to get that off your chest, clear that up.

161
00:06:44,105 --> 00:06:45,504
All right, guys. Good job, everybody.

162
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,484
See ya tomorrow. Grace...

163
00:06:47,842 --> 00:06:49,001
Good job today.

164
00:06:49,001 --> 00:06:50,242
Success!

165
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,675
Oh, look who showed up.

166
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,310
Yeah, well, it was either this

167
00:07:01,353 --> 00:07:03,755
or a 15-hour bus ride to Long Island,

168
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,213
so... it was a toss-up.

169
00:07:05,238 --> 00:07:07,238
Mm-hmm. What the hell are you wearing?

170
00:07:07,621 --> 00:07:09,410
I'm sorry... did you
just come back from court?

171
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:12,044
Yes. And the judge ruled I look awesome.

172
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,179
Ah!

173
00:07:13,214 --> 00:07:14,861
Well, we're glad you came.

174
00:07:14,861 --> 00:07:16,315
- What are you guys drinkin'?
- Oh, I'm not.

175
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:17,750
You don't wanna see me drink.

176
00:07:17,785 --> 00:07:20,319
I get really emotional
and clean out my purse.

177
00:07:20,354 --> 00:07:21,887
- It's nuts.
- Oh, well, that was

178
00:07:21,923 --> 00:07:23,322
a long way around "no, thank you."

179
00:07:23,357 --> 00:07:25,837
- Yeah, she does that.
- So, Jack,

180
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,416
here's what we're talking about.

181
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:30,252
Now, I'm looking to catch
a financially stable man

182
00:07:30,288 --> 00:07:33,323
for a casual yet respectable situationship.

183
00:07:33,331 --> 00:07:34,864
- Hmm.
- And Mary over here

184
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:36,413
is looking for a scuzzy little liar.

185
00:07:36,423 --> 00:07:37,889
Oh, you always hated Mark.

186
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:40,094
Well, he stole your computer.

187
00:07:40,561 --> 00:07:43,691
- He's fixing the<i> viruses.</i>
- No, he's not.

188
00:07:43,746 --> 00:07:45,296
I'll tell you what kind of guy I like.

189
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:47,332
My husband Keith. He's so good to me.

190
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:49,021
He planted me a secret garden.

191
00:07:49,046 --> 00:07:51,547
I don't know what's in
there. I think it's tomatoes!

192
00:07:51,582 --> 00:07:53,515
- Ha ha ha ha.
- So what are you

193
00:07:53,551 --> 00:07:55,025
- looking for, Jack?
- Well...

194
00:07:55,603 --> 00:07:57,519
this one over by the bar
seems acceptable to me.

195
00:07:57,555 --> 00:07:59,353
- Oh, she's acceptable.
- Oh, yes.

196
00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:00,956
- She will serve my needs nicely.
- Her parents must be so proud.

197
00:08:00,991 --> 00:08:03,195
Stop it, I mean, no, she's... she's cute.

198
00:08:03,195 --> 00:08:04,394
That's our yoga teacher Vicky.

199
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,062
- Ah.
- Okay, we'll go grease

200
00:08:06,098 --> 00:08:08,053
the runway, but you have to land the plane.

201
00:08:08,053 --> 00:08:09,471
Uh... I think I got it.

202
00:08:09,496 --> 00:08:11,014
Okay...

203
00:08:11,665 --> 00:08:12,653
Yeah.

204
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,784
I, uh...

205
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:17,729
had sex with the Head of Women's Studies,

206
00:08:18,061 --> 00:08:19,977
so I think I can handle Yoga Vicky, right?

207
00:08:20,525 --> 00:08:21,488
Ah...

208
00:08:21,577 --> 00:08:23,526
This is who we were talking about.

209
00:08:23,562 --> 00:08:25,662
Jack is so smart

210
00:08:25,697 --> 00:08:27,896
and has so many sweaters...

211
00:08:27,896 --> 00:08:30,296
So, Jack, we're gonna
go grab another drink.

212
00:08:30,332 --> 00:08:32,698
Will you keep our friend Vicky company?

213
00:08:32,734 --> 00:08:34,298
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

214
00:08:34,577 --> 00:08:36,010
Hi, Jack. Nice to meet you.

215
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,543
Hi. It's nice to meet you too.

216
00:08:37,579 --> 00:08:39,545
It's, uh... always nice to meet new people.

217
00:08:39,581 --> 00:08:42,052
I just moved here from Cambridge.

218
00:08:42,077 --> 00:08:43,555
That's where Harvard is.

219
00:08:43,758 --> 00:08:45,199
I taught there. At Harvard.

220
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:47,162
I was a philosophy professor, so...

221
00:08:49,051 --> 00:08:50,683
- Okay.
- At Harvard.

222
00:08:50,918 --> 00:08:53,329
It's a prestigious
university in the Northeast.

223
00:08:53,329 --> 00:08:54,387
I know.

224
00:08:54,898 --> 00:08:56,630
Oh... I have a work emergency.

225
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,066
Oh, a yoga emergency?

226
00:08:58,384 --> 00:08:59,616
Michelle told me where you work.

227
00:08:59,651 --> 00:09:01,386
Well, then you know what this is.

228
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,284
Morning, boss!

229
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:14,802
Want a little touch-up before we...

230
00:09:17,427 --> 00:09:19,156
Dennis, roll it.

231
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:20,465
I got a new take.

232
00:09:20,757 --> 00:09:21,889
Okay...

233
00:09:21,925 --> 00:09:23,792
Ahh. Yeah.

234
00:09:24,194 --> 00:09:27,008
Good mornin', Whitlock High!

235
00:09:27,008 --> 00:09:29,775
<i>Here's the morning
announcements in your face!</i>

236
00:09:29,811 --> 00:09:31,063
<i>Ooh!</i>

237
00:09:31,063 --> 00:09:33,171
<i>Guess what's for lunch today. Pizza!</i>

238
00:09:33,262 --> 00:09:35,449
<i>With a side order of hepatitis A.</i>

239
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:37,359
<i>Ha ha. Cafeteria food.</i>

240
00:09:37,676 --> 00:09:39,009
<i>Sucks! Right?</i>

241
00:09:39,044 --> 00:09:40,643
<i>You know who else has hepatitis A?</i>

242
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:42,169
<i>Jeremy Jones.</i>

243
00:09:44,716 --> 00:09:46,924
<i>Jeremy will be spending</i>

244
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:49,247
<i>some time at Children's Hospital,</i>

245
00:09:49,247 --> 00:09:51,847
so everybody sign the big card.

246
00:09:52,183 --> 00:09:53,562
We love you, Jeremy.

247
00:09:53,562 --> 00:09:57,531
<i>Oh! My God, a huge
celebrity just dropped by.</i>

248
00:09:59,169 --> 00:10:00,568
<i>Yo, whazzup?</i>

249
00:10:00,603 --> 00:10:02,708
<i>It's Snoop Da-zoggy Dogg!</i>

250
00:10:02,938 --> 00:10:04,405
<i>Get your tickets</i>

251
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,006
- <i>to the Sadie Hawkins dance.</i>
- What?

252
00:10:06,042 --> 00:10:07,479
I think that's blackface.

253
00:10:07,504 --> 00:10:08,589
<i>Ah, l...</i>

254
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:12,737
What ya thinkin', chief?

255
00:10:13,298 --> 00:10:15,272
Uh, thanks for asking. I don't know.

256
00:10:15,307 --> 00:10:17,942
I don't know. Last
night, I opened myself up

257
00:10:17,977 --> 00:10:19,209
to dating Toledo women.

258
00:10:19,245 --> 00:10:20,321
You clean up?

259
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:22,120
One would think.

260
00:10:22,145 --> 00:10:23,642
Uh, no, you know what? I...

261
00:10:24,506 --> 00:10:25,981
I came up empty all night.

262
00:10:26,243 --> 00:10:28,210
You know, I have devoted my entire life

263
00:10:28,245 --> 00:10:30,813
to studying logic and reason, but this...

264
00:10:31,174 --> 00:10:33,946
this night made me
question everything. Truly.

265
00:10:33,946 --> 00:10:35,150
I-I-I
just...

266
00:10:35,186 --> 00:10:36,781
I don't know what... went wrong.

267
00:10:37,382 --> 00:10:38,771
You probably talked about Harvard

268
00:10:38,772 --> 00:10:40,852
- and philosophy too much.
- Sarika...

269
00:10:42,362 --> 00:10:44,161
you may have stumbled onto something there.

270
00:10:44,196 --> 00:10:46,764
Mm-hmm. You're saying that
it was too in their face

271
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:48,079
how much better I was than them.

272
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,378
That... wasn't really

273
00:10:49,412 --> 00:10:51,046
- what I...
- A preemptive self-rejection.

274
00:10:51,081 --> 00:10:52,781
An interesting concept,
and I think we should

275
00:10:52,816 --> 00:10:54,315
get it on its feet. Victor.

276
00:10:54,351 --> 00:10:55,750
Please, no more...

277
00:10:55,785 --> 00:10:57,118
Is that why you've never confessed

278
00:10:57,153 --> 00:10:58,753
your secret crush on Grace?

279
00:10:58,788 --> 00:11:00,655
Because you're afraid that
she's going to reject you.

280
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:01,922
You think that you are beneath her.

281
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:03,179
Please wake up.

282
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,337
- Please wake up.
- Grace, do you think

283
00:11:04,367 --> 00:11:06,273
you could ever be into Victor?

284
00:11:06,327 --> 00:11:08,836
- What's wrong with him?
- I don't want to say.

285
00:11:08,871 --> 00:11:10,504
Oh. You don't wanna say.

286
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,440
Maybe it's you that's into weird stuff.

287
00:11:12,475 --> 00:11:15,142
- Maybe I should start guessing...
- I have a secret boyfriend.

288
00:11:15,177 --> 00:11:17,110
- Is it me?
- It's not a secret

289
00:11:17,146 --> 00:11:18,345
- to the boyfriend.
- Okay, this is good.

290
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,180
Yeah, no, okay, so, um,

291
00:11:20,215 --> 00:11:22,149
Grace, who is the lucky guy?

292
00:11:23,691 --> 00:11:24,667
It's Marcus.

293
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:26,034
My best friend?

294
00:11:28,886 --> 00:11:31,621
Okay. Well, this has been a
surprisingly productive class.

295
00:11:31,621 --> 00:11:33,487
Thank you, Grace. Thank you, Victor.

296
00:11:33,524 --> 00:11:35,490
This has been very helpful for me.

297
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:37,158
Good work.

298
00:11:37,627 --> 00:11:39,194
Did you make that at home?

299
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,495
- Yeah, girl.
- I might have to

300
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:42,264
- sneak in there.
- Hey, guys. Okay,

301
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:44,315
so I think you were right.
I misplayed it last night.

302
00:11:44,315 --> 00:11:45,414
Oh... ya think?

303
00:11:45,449 --> 00:11:47,436
I get it, I get it. I hashed
it out with my students,

304
00:11:47,461 --> 00:11:49,561
and I realized with my Harvard pedigree,

305
00:11:49,953 --> 00:11:52,287
I was like a Grace in
a bar full of Victors.

306
00:11:52,323 --> 00:11:54,556
But I get it now. Let's get back in there

307
00:11:54,557 --> 00:11:56,279
and let's get after it. I
need you guys to wing me.

308
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:58,713
- Let's go.
- You gonna take our advice?

309
00:11:58,749 --> 00:11:59,670
Yes!

310
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:01,644
What was it again?

311
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,546
Just... be normal.

312
00:12:03,581 --> 00:12:06,388
Right. Just... <i>normal.</i>

313
00:12:06,951 --> 00:12:08,170
Why are you saying it weird?

314
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:10,003
Jack, it's "nermal." Oh, my God,

315
00:12:10,038 --> 00:12:11,638
now I can't say it either.

316
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,691
Sorry, Jack, it's a no.

317
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:15,192
How 'bout this. I'll buy drinks all night.

318
00:12:15,227 --> 00:12:16,526
- Good answer!
- Here we go.

319
00:12:16,562 --> 00:12:18,103
- Good answer, good answer.
- <i>Normal.</i>

320
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:20,465
Thank God I got it back.

321
00:12:20,768 --> 00:12:21,770
Whew!

322
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:26,436
Ooh. Now, there's a sturdy one,

323
00:12:26,472 --> 00:12:29,473
looking like he could
mow his lawn in a tornado.

324
00:12:29,508 --> 00:12:30,742
Well, you better give it up

325
00:12:30,742 --> 00:12:32,008
for these pear-shaped men

326
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:33,523
- lookin' just like they mamas.
- Mmm...

327
00:12:33,524 --> 00:12:35,224
Hey, hey. What do you guys think?

328
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,592
- Took your advice.
- You know,

329
00:12:36,628 --> 00:12:38,857
mm-mm, I'm sorry, I forgot, ladies.

330
00:12:38,882 --> 00:12:40,616
Was our advice to make him look like

331
00:12:40,641 --> 00:12:43,514
a cell phone salesman from the mall kiosk?

332
00:12:43,523 --> 00:12:45,389
Ha ha ha ha. No, no, no.

333
00:12:45,425 --> 00:12:47,525
This is so the Toledo women
will not be intimidated by me.

334
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,762
Oh, so you think this
is what's normal here?

335
00:12:49,762 --> 00:12:52,429
Yep. Tonight I'm just
normal old Toledo Jack.

336
00:12:52,465 --> 00:12:55,099
Oh, waiter? Yeah. Can I
get a plate of cheese fries

337
00:12:55,134 --> 00:12:56,433
and any kind of a beer

338
00:12:56,469 --> 00:12:58,502
that's got a landscape on the can.

339
00:12:59,272 --> 00:13:00,550
Let's do this!

340
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:06,132
All right, guys, ready to set me up?

341
00:13:06,515 --> 00:13:07,747
Grease the runway?

342
00:13:07,782 --> 00:13:09,349
No, no, no, no, no, Toledo Jack.

343
00:13:09,385 --> 00:13:10,683
We wants no parts

344
00:13:10,719 --> 00:13:12,754
- of whatever is happening here.
- Right.

345
00:13:12,817 --> 00:13:14,851
But do leave your tab open... thank you.

346
00:13:14,876 --> 00:13:17,210
Yeah, yeah. All right, here we go.

347
00:13:17,246 --> 00:13:18,945
- Good luck.
- Watch him leave.

348
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,947
Look... Look at it. Look at his belt.

349
00:13:20,982 --> 00:13:23,903
Ah... man. Feels good to sit down.

350
00:13:23,967 --> 00:13:25,089
Can I buy you a drink?

351
00:13:25,935 --> 00:13:28,300
Sure, I'll... I'll have another house wine.

352
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,185
Great. Another house wine, please.

353
00:13:30,898 --> 00:13:32,306
Yeah, so...

354
00:13:33,705 --> 00:13:34,972
Isis.

355
00:13:35,488 --> 00:13:37,304
Don't those guys drive you nuts?

356
00:13:37,305 --> 00:13:38,497
You know, for me,

357
00:13:38,497 --> 00:13:40,364
it's like, ah, God, stop, you know?

358
00:13:40,398 --> 00:13:41,952
You make me sick.

359
00:13:42,786 --> 00:13:44,085
Yeah. Isis isn't great.

360
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,237
Yeah. No. It's like, you know...

361
00:13:52,095 --> 00:13:53,228
Ahh... hey.

362
00:13:53,263 --> 00:13:56,061
Are you, uh, an organ donor?

363
00:13:56,152 --> 00:13:58,085
- Yeah, of course.
- Of course you are. Me too.

364
00:13:58,121 --> 00:14:00,654
I would love to be able
to... you know, donate my...

365
00:14:00,689 --> 00:14:02,322
I mean, I don't wanna die, but if I did,

366
00:14:02,358 --> 00:14:05,427
I wanna give some kid the
gift of sight, you know?

367
00:14:05,794 --> 00:14:07,327
Maybe I would get to see the world

368
00:14:07,363 --> 00:14:08,662
through a child's eyes again.

369
00:14:08,697 --> 00:14:10,588
Is that how it works? I don't know.

370
00:14:10,588 --> 00:14:12,855
I'm just some normal
guy. I don't read much.

371
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,661
- <i>♪ I love gin juice ♪</i>
- That is funny.

372
00:14:19,696 --> 00:14:20,829
<i>♪ Drivin' in my car ♪</i>

373
00:14:20,864 --> 00:14:22,262
<i>♪ Gin juice ♪</i>

374
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,262
Is there anything that
I can do before I go?

375
00:14:26,754 --> 00:14:29,583
No, uh, Helen, I think you've done enough.

376
00:14:29,807 --> 00:14:31,840
- Ralph, is there something...
- Could you close the door?

377
00:14:31,876 --> 00:14:33,742
Can you do that, Helen?
Can you close the door?

378
00:14:33,778 --> 00:14:35,542
Or is that too simple? Do you need to

379
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:36,941
put like a fun spin on it.

380
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:39,037
Or can I have. The door. Closed.

381
00:14:39,062 --> 00:14:41,012
Which is... all I ever... wanted?

382
00:14:43,235 --> 00:14:44,734
See how easy that was?

383
00:14:45,586 --> 00:14:46,618
- Oh, no.
- Excellent.

384
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:48,004
I'm doing this!

385
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:50,903
- This place sucks.
- Please.

386
00:14:50,939 --> 00:14:52,472
Did you think that wearing a golf shirt

387
00:14:52,507 --> 00:14:54,269
and talking about organ donors would work?

388
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:56,069
You know what I think?
I think you're afraid

389
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:57,883
you'll meet someone and like Toledo.

390
00:14:57,883 --> 00:15:00,524
Ooh! Michelle, comin'
through with the realness.

391
00:15:00,549 --> 00:15:02,549
Yes, and you know what? And
while you're "slumming" it

392
00:15:02,585 --> 00:15:04,351
- with the commoners...
- Here we go.

393
00:15:04,386 --> 00:15:06,554
You're missing out on some fabulous women.

394
00:15:06,554 --> 00:15:08,154
- Okay?
- Truth bomb.

395
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:10,957
All right, well, thank
you for the therapy, buds,

396
00:15:10,982 --> 00:15:13,082
I appreciate it, but
I'm done with this place.

397
00:15:13,093 --> 00:15:15,327
Oh, stay! We're gonna get some fire wings

398
00:15:15,362 --> 00:15:17,004
and do pucker shots.

399
00:15:17,029 --> 00:15:18,747
Plus, Michelle is drinking,

400
00:15:18,772 --> 00:15:21,451
and so we might need a white
man to talk to the cops.

401
00:15:21,514 --> 00:15:23,146
Well, this was fun, but I think I'm gonna

402
00:15:23,181 --> 00:15:25,315
- close out my tab. Sorry, guys.
- Oh...

403
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:28,551
Hey, can I close out, please? Thanks.

404
00:15:28,586 --> 00:15:30,583
Not a single imported beer.

405
00:15:30,885 --> 00:15:32,851
God, I forgot I'm in Garbage City.

406
00:15:32,887 --> 00:15:34,278
It's actually Glass City.

407
00:15:37,099 --> 00:15:38,532
Yeah, no thanks.

408
00:15:38,567 --> 00:15:40,667
I'm good. I don't need to
update my cell phone plan.

409
00:15:40,703 --> 00:15:42,202
Oh, no, no, these clothes...

410
00:15:42,237 --> 00:15:44,178
I'm doing a social experiment.

411
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,429
I'm actually just in
town for a brief stint.

412
00:15:46,909 --> 00:15:48,241
I'm taking a break from Harvard.

413
00:15:48,741 --> 00:15:50,076
- Oh.
- Yeah, you know what?

414
00:15:50,112 --> 00:15:51,642
Forget that.

415
00:15:52,014 --> 00:15:53,157
I-I'm Jack.

416
00:15:53,157 --> 00:15:55,290
I take it you're not
from around here either?

417
00:15:55,325 --> 00:15:57,159
Chloe. From Baltimore.

418
00:15:57,194 --> 00:15:59,527
Yeah, I can see that you enjoy this city

419
00:15:59,562 --> 00:16:00,762
about as much as I do.

420
00:16:00,798 --> 00:16:02,030
- It's the worst.
- Yeah.

421
00:16:02,065 --> 00:16:03,698
Oh, don't even try getting decent sushi.

422
00:16:03,733 --> 00:16:05,138
- What?
- It's impossible.

423
00:16:05,138 --> 00:16:07,005
You know what I worry about? I worry about

424
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,706
the doctors. I mean, if you're
actually good at surgery,

425
00:16:08,742 --> 00:16:10,107
what are you doing
here? I mean, how did you

426
00:16:10,143 --> 00:16:11,675
not move to Chicago?

427
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:13,344
Well, at least the people are amazing.

428
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:14,778
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, right? I mean

429
00:16:14,813 --> 00:16:16,747
like that guy over there
with his gut hanging out?

430
00:16:16,782 --> 00:16:19,107
He just invited me to his
summer home in Provence.

431
00:16:19,107 --> 00:16:20,918
- Oh! You gonna go?
- Oh, I have to.

432
00:16:20,953 --> 00:16:22,453
- I think you should.
- How do you turn that down?

433
00:16:22,488 --> 00:16:24,621
Check this out. See da Vinci over there?

434
00:16:24,657 --> 00:16:26,456
Yeah, he just invited me to check out

435
00:16:26,491 --> 00:16:27,925
this crazy new invention

436
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,964
that he's never even tried called "a fork."

437
00:16:30,596 --> 00:16:32,149
We shouldn't be too hard on this place.

438
00:16:32,227 --> 00:16:34,130
- No.
- Right? I mean, after all,

439
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:36,266
there is a table of
scientists right over there.

440
00:16:36,301 --> 00:16:37,853
- Really?
- Yeah.

441
00:16:38,282 --> 00:16:40,149
Ugh! They're brilliant.

442
00:16:40,184 --> 00:16:42,350
Booyah! These shots are
not gonna drink themselves.

443
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:45,987
Hey, you wanna get outta here

444
00:16:46,022 --> 00:16:47,922
before the dumb rubs off on us?

445
00:16:49,459 --> 00:16:50,702
Uh, uh...

446
00:16:52,031 --> 00:16:53,261
I think they're just having fun.

447
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:55,263
And, uh, actually,

448
00:16:55,909 --> 00:16:57,061
they're friends of mine.

449
00:16:57,061 --> 00:16:59,061
Right! My friend is here too.

450
00:16:59,096 --> 00:17:00,662
Right over there. She's the lady

451
00:17:00,697 --> 00:17:02,219
that brought her newborn to the bar.

452
00:17:02,533 --> 00:17:03,932
Busties!

453
00:17:03,967 --> 00:17:05,867
Yeah, first of all, you really know

454
00:17:05,903 --> 00:17:06,950
how to run a joke into the ground.

455
00:17:06,951 --> 00:17:08,474
Secondly, I wasn't kidding.

456
00:17:08,474 --> 00:17:09,901
They really are friends of mine.

457
00:17:10,142 --> 00:17:12,076
You know what? No. I'm
gonna keep this open.

458
00:17:12,111 --> 00:17:14,077
Can I get three blue pucker shots, please?

459
00:17:14,702 --> 00:17:17,833
Uh, actually... make it four.

460
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:19,295
Also...

461
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:21,731
Baltimore... It's a third-rate city.

462
00:17:21,767 --> 00:17:25,017
It sucks. And you have dead
women buried in your parks.

463
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:29,825
- Ladies, some shots.
- Hey!

464
00:17:29,861 --> 00:17:32,060
It looks like you were making
it happen with that one.

465
00:17:32,095 --> 00:17:33,495
What'd you mess up this time?

466
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:35,330
Who knows? But it looked like you guys

467
00:17:35,366 --> 00:17:37,165
were having more fun over
here, so I figured I join you

468
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,300
- and stay.
- Okay!

469
00:17:38,335 --> 00:17:40,058
- All right!
- Hey, hey!

470
00:17:41,037 --> 00:17:42,245
- Mm.
- Yeah!

471
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:43,599
Tornado Dance!

472
00:17:43,974 --> 00:17:45,507
- Yeah...
- Uh...

473
00:17:45,542 --> 00:17:46,659
excuse you?

474
00:17:47,177 --> 00:17:48,509
- Yeah?
- No, no, no, no, no.

475
00:17:48,544 --> 00:17:50,511
Sorry. Sorry, that's on us.

476
00:17:50,546 --> 00:17:52,147
It's not worth it, girl, it's not worth it.

477
00:17:52,182 --> 00:17:53,316
Walk away.

478
00:18:02,834 --> 00:18:05,101
Oops. It looks like there's
a little lighting issue.

479
00:18:05,136 --> 00:18:07,207
There's a shadow. You want me to fix that?

480
00:18:07,207 --> 00:18:08,940
Yeah, sure, Helen. Why don't you just

481
00:18:08,975 --> 00:18:11,809
- take over the whole production?
- I can't take this anymore!

482
00:18:11,845 --> 00:18:13,510
What is this about, Ralph?

483
00:18:14,419 --> 00:18:15,873
Dennis, a moment.

484
00:18:17,268 --> 00:18:19,135
You really don't know
what this is about, do you?

485
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:20,879
Morning announcements were my chance

486
00:18:20,884 --> 00:18:22,094
to be the cool guy,

487
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:23,352
to connect with the students,

488
00:18:23,387 --> 00:18:25,007
and you took them from me!

489
00:18:25,067 --> 00:18:28,568
Oh, Ralph, why would I ever
do anything to hurt you?

490
00:18:28,787 --> 00:18:30,683
<i>You pulled me up from the gutter.</i>

491
00:18:30,683 --> 00:18:31,848
<i>You're an amazing man.</i>

492
00:18:31,884 --> 00:18:34,185
<i>I would never take the
announcements from you.</i>

493
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:36,819
<i>Well, it's too late.
I'm awake now, Helen.</i>

494
00:18:36,828 --> 00:18:38,428
<i>I thought I had this game cornered,</i>

495
00:18:38,464 --> 00:18:39,601
<i>then you came in and did it in a way</i>

496
00:18:39,601 --> 00:18:41,198
<i>that I didn't know what possible!</i>

497
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:43,055
<i>- I'm a fraud.
- No.</i>

498
00:18:43,405 --> 00:18:46,820
<i>- You should do them!
- Oh! I should do them.</i>

499
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:50,226
<i>Ha! You think that's
what people want?</i>

500
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:53,622
<i>Me runnin' around
like a big, dumb goof?</i>

501
00:18:54,614 --> 00:18:57,801
<i>I do that crap for my
nephew, and he's five.</i>

502
00:18:58,109 --> 00:18:59,938
<i>Forever, if you know what I mean.</i>

503
00:19:01,331 --> 00:19:03,140
<i>Holy crap. Is that thing on?</i>

504
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:04,174
<i>Oh...</i>

505
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:09,679
I don't understand what they see in you.

506
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,387
Well... this is fun!

507
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:19,022
Who, uh, who started all this?

508
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:20,490
- You!
- Me?

509
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:22,224
Well, this is already awesome.

510
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,860
- Explain.
- When you revealed

511
00:19:23,895 --> 00:19:25,427
that Victor liked Grace, we also found out

512
00:19:25,463 --> 00:19:27,329
she had a secret boyfriend, Marcus.

513
00:19:27,365 --> 00:19:28,564
But she was actually protecting

514
00:19:28,599 --> 00:19:30,066
her real secret boyfriend, Devin,

515
00:19:30,101 --> 00:19:32,568
not realizing Marcus is
secretly dating Sarika,

516
00:19:32,603 --> 00:19:33,936
who got super-jealous.

517
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:36,039
So Sarika decided to revenge-date Devin.

518
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:38,774
But Devin is fluid, so
he may actually like me.

519
00:19:38,809 --> 00:19:40,676
And unrelatedly, Colin lost his retainer

520
00:19:40,711 --> 00:19:42,178
and is afraid to tell his mom,

521
00:19:42,213 --> 00:19:44,680
and no one is talking to
anyone, a-and we're drowning!

522
00:19:45,033 --> 00:19:46,883
Colin, you need to just tell your mom.

523
00:19:46,917 --> 00:19:49,051
Okay, hey, guys, guys, guys.

524
00:19:49,086 --> 00:19:51,960
Wow! You are being far too dramatic.

525
00:19:52,394 --> 00:19:54,790
I mean, don't you realize how meaningless

526
00:19:54,825 --> 00:19:56,391
these little teenage crushes are?

527
00:19:56,426 --> 00:19:59,594
Come on, only adult romances
actually mean anything.

528
00:19:59,905 --> 00:20:01,472
Look, the point is, you should

529
00:20:01,507 --> 00:20:03,407
all just be focused on your friendships.

530
00:20:03,443 --> 00:20:06,101
Don't worry about all
this petty dating stuff.

531
00:20:06,412 --> 00:20:08,346
Okay? You should all be
downing shots together

532
00:20:08,381 --> 00:20:11,872
and doing dances based on
natural disasters, you know?

533
00:20:12,365 --> 00:20:14,499
Leave all this other crap behind, you know?

534
00:20:14,534 --> 00:20:17,829
Otherwise, you're just gonna be
stuck in Toledo goin' it alone.

535
00:20:18,449 --> 00:20:20,581
Look, you're gonna have your whole lives

536
00:20:20,581 --> 00:20:22,681
to worry about dating, 'kay?

537
00:20:22,717 --> 00:20:24,049
Right now, honestly, you should probably

538
00:20:24,085 --> 00:20:25,970
just be focused on masturbating.

539
00:20:26,093 --> 00:20:27,495
You guys all masturbate, right?

540
00:20:28,612 --> 00:20:29,674
Yeah?

541
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,036
Show of hands real quick.

542
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,740
Oh, no...

543
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,238
Yeah, that's tough. That's tough.

544
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:47,669
I noticed you weren't entangled

545
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:49,337
in any of the love triangles.

546
00:20:49,363 --> 00:20:51,199
You prefer to stay above the fray.

547
00:20:51,488 --> 00:20:52,979
I don't mess with this kid stuff.

548
00:20:54,522 --> 00:20:56,091
I'm looking for a real woman.

549
00:21:02,536 --> 00:21:03,999
Oh, [BLEEP].

550
