1
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,920
Is this a documentary?

2
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:24,717
No, it's
not a documentary.

3
00:00:24,823 --> 00:00:26,415
It's fiction.
It's a drama.

4
00:00:26,525 --> 00:00:28,356
What's it
about? It's fiction?

5
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:31,020
This is a
film I made about six years ago.

6
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:33,530
The subject matter maybe
is a little sensitive...

7
00:00:33,632 --> 00:00:34,860
...with some people.

8
00:00:34,967 --> 00:00:36,559
What is it about, like...

9
00:00:36,668 --> 00:00:39,762
Well, I won't tell you. What
I'll let you do is watch it.

10
00:00:39,872 --> 00:00:41,396
I'm guessing it's about, uh...

11
00:00:41,507 --> 00:00:42,496
...rockets.

12
00:00:42,608 --> 00:00:44,974
No, I'm guessing it's
about male itch.

13
00:00:45,077 --> 00:00:46,942
Hey, turn
on the colour!

14
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:52,609
Make it better. Turn up
the good, turn down the suck.

15
00:00:52,718 --> 00:00:55,152
Turn down the suck knob.

16
00:00:55,254 --> 00:00:59,384
I think you got suck all the
way cranked to ten, Farrel.

17
00:00:59,491 --> 00:01:01,857
Cranked it right up to ten.

18
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,123
I think you broke
the knob off crankin it so hard.

19
00:01:08,934 --> 00:01:13,701
I'm just sitting here
thinking to myself, oh, I could, yeah...

20
00:01:13,806 --> 00:01:17,298
...really go for a six minute
fuckin' sit-through of shit.

21
00:01:17,409 --> 00:01:19,434
And he played drums late and
he never helped her with her...

22
00:01:19,545 --> 00:01:20,842
...fuckin' homework.

23
00:01:20,946 --> 00:01:23,540
Boo fuckin' hoo. Big fuckin'
deal, he plays drums late.

24
00:01:23,649 --> 00:01:27,779
And her fuckin'
yo-yo was busted. Yo, yo fuckin' blows.

25
00:02:25,344 --> 00:02:28,074
Drive yer own fuckin'
car, let yer woman stay at home.

26
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,408
Whoooo!

27
00:02:29,515 --> 00:02:31,278
Hey, hey, hey!

28
00:02:31,383 --> 00:02:34,352
I'll give you a gummer and I'll
giv'er, an' then I'll come an'

29
00:02:34,453 --> 00:02:37,820
...give it. Come an' give it for
to come and giv'er Deaner.

30
00:02:37,923 --> 00:02:39,857
Give'er, give it, Deaner.

31
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:44,122
Basically I would say
an uncooperative and rebellious...

32
00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:48,029
...attitude, which um, well, it
worked itself out in, you know...

33
00:02:48,133 --> 00:02:52,695
...long greasy hair, beer
advertisement t-shirts.

34
00:02:56,642 --> 00:02:58,041
Whoo!

35
00:02:58,143 --> 00:02:59,633
Nail 'em!

36
00:02:59,745 --> 00:03:02,976
I recommend you
try another sport.

37
00:03:03,081 --> 00:03:05,549
Like knitting!

38
00:03:05,651 --> 00:03:08,814
Knit yourself a
fuckin' somebody!

39
00:03:08,921 --> 00:03:12,880
Oh, they like to play
some of the worst of the bands.

40
00:03:12,991 --> 00:03:19,863
Oh what was it? Dead Leopard
or Sick Cougar or some of those.

41
00:03:33,745 --> 00:03:36,737
That was
wonderful, you think?

42
00:03:36,848 --> 00:03:37,974
Yeah.

43
00:03:40,018 --> 00:03:42,953
Currently I'm working
at a furniture store.

44
00:03:43,055 --> 00:03:44,579
Yeah?

45
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:47,215
And I uh... Make tables.

46
00:03:48,627 --> 00:03:50,322
A little under 800 bucks.

47
00:03:50,429 --> 00:03:52,226
For working
one day a week?

48
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:53,263
Two weeks.

49
00:03:53,365 --> 00:03:54,662
For two weeks?

50
00:03:54,766 --> 00:03:56,825
Yeah, I get 400 bucks a week.

51
00:03:56,935 --> 00:03:58,800
But that's before
the government...

52
00:03:58,904 --> 00:04:00,735
...takes their fuckin'
part, you know?

53
00:04:00,839 --> 00:04:02,602
Tell us about that.

54
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:05,108
The government takes their part.

55
00:04:06,812 --> 00:04:09,610
I'm trying to use more pneumatic
tools these days so that it...

56
00:04:09,715 --> 00:04:12,946
...does. So that uh... Easier
on the environment.

57
00:04:29,101 --> 00:04:32,434
He... His job was a
swamper. I don't know but...

58
00:04:32,537 --> 00:04:34,368
...if you're familiar with that?

59
00:04:34,473 --> 00:04:36,407
Explain it,
that would be great.

60
00:04:36,508 --> 00:04:38,999
A swamper is a helper,
is a driver's helper.

61
00:04:39,111 --> 00:04:40,874
See, this
is one that I built.

62
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:43,675
42 inch dewill.
Feels thick, hey?

63
00:04:43,782 --> 00:04:45,909
How thick would
you say that table feels?

64
00:04:46,018 --> 00:04:49,044
The table's actually that thick.
That's why it's called a double...

65
00:04:49,154 --> 00:04:53,557
...edge. Makes it look a lot
thicker. This is solid oak.

66
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:58,790
He would not be doing
anything other than the manual...

67
00:04:58,897 --> 00:05:01,195
...lifting of furniture
in and out of a truck...

68
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,133
...and into a person's home.

69
00:05:04,236 --> 00:05:07,228
You push it through
and it rips it in half.

70
00:05:07,339 --> 00:05:09,204
He don't
do nothing else.

71
00:05:17,316 --> 00:05:18,749
Are you alright?

72
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,374
Yeah, I just fuckin'...

73
00:05:22,688 --> 00:05:25,851
Ever since I quit smoking, I've
just been fuckin' coughing up...

74
00:05:25,957 --> 00:05:27,481
...the weirdest shit.

75
00:05:27,592 --> 00:05:29,457
There would
be a moon here.

76
00:05:29,561 --> 00:05:30,858
A large rocket.

77
00:05:30,962 --> 00:05:34,523
It'll be all dark space
punctuated by planets.

78
00:05:34,633 --> 00:05:38,399
I would have a close-up,
like, of a lady on a cliff...

79
00:05:38,503 --> 00:05:42,098
...and she would have a giant
fuckin' laser gun, and she'd sort...

80
00:05:42,207 --> 00:05:44,437
...ofjust be, protecting.

81
00:05:44,543 --> 00:05:48,377
My son was a very happy
person and he was really uh...

82
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,916
...really good to me, and then
after he met that, that uh...

83
00:05:52,017 --> 00:05:56,147
...that uh... That
woman, he changed.

84
00:05:56,254 --> 00:05:58,518
Chastity.

85
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:06,562
I mean right now
we're not exactly, you know...

86
00:06:06,665 --> 00:06:11,693
...together, right? We don't
live together and...

87
00:06:11,803 --> 00:06:14,636
You know what the
problem is. You know how...

88
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,833
...to change. You know how
to fix the problem.

89
00:06:16,942 --> 00:06:19,308
I know, see, it
always comes down to me.

90
00:06:19,411 --> 00:06:22,437
And it always comes
down to, to Deaner.

91
00:06:22,547 --> 00:06:27,416
As it stands, plan b is just
To keep on givin'er, Farrel.

92
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:29,749
What exactly
does that mean?

93
00:06:29,855 --> 00:06:32,289
Giv'er. You just, you go out,
and you giv'er, like you...

94
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:34,052
...work hard, that's what that.

95
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:36,059
Is that, is that a plan?

96
00:06:36,161 --> 00:06:37,822
Yeah that's
a plan right there.

97
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,560
Look man, I already told
you. I fuckin' play the bass.

98
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:42,499
And that's what I'm gonna do.

99
00:06:44,636 --> 00:06:46,501
Jesus! Ow! Ow!

100
00:06:50,108 --> 00:06:53,134
Well, Dean always
liked to play by himself...

101
00:06:53,245 --> 00:06:55,270
...he had a vivid imagination.

102
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:05,017
I'm trying to
get a gig with a band.

103
00:07:05,123 --> 00:07:08,354
I was in a band a while
ago called Creeper.

104
00:07:10,662 --> 00:07:14,894
It's ringing. Yeah hi,
is Bill there please? Uh, Bill.

105
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,629
So, like whatever you guys are
into, like, give me a mix tape...

106
00:07:18,737 --> 00:07:21,331
...give me a couple days, and
I'll just fuckin', I'll show up...

107
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,431
...and we'll go from there, man.

108
00:07:27,846 --> 00:07:29,575
It's
in normal tuning.

109
00:07:29,681 --> 00:07:31,774
Oh, it's
normal tuning? Okay.

110
00:07:31,883 --> 00:07:34,010
So we're gonna do...

111
00:07:39,224 --> 00:07:41,419
It's like, as far as
tones are concerned, like the...

112
00:07:41,526 --> 00:07:44,757
...tones are a lot lower, and like
the - Your ear actually has to...

113
00:07:44,863 --> 00:07:48,321
...pick up like, a hell of a lot
more than a guitar player's ear.

114
00:07:48,433 --> 00:07:50,765
You actually
have to get a five-string...

115
00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:53,269
...because it's a whole
step down, you need to just...

116
00:07:53,371 --> 00:07:55,896
Well, I'll fuckin'
just like, I'll just giv'er up...

117
00:07:56,007 --> 00:07:58,168
...top and we'll see what happens.

118
00:07:58,276 --> 00:08:00,267
Yeah, just harmonize.

119
00:08:02,614 --> 00:08:05,708
The taste in your tongue
for the spice is like the taste...

120
00:08:05,817 --> 00:08:08,479
...in your fuckin'
bones for the bass.

121
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,287
He may get in a band,
or he may go solo, or he may...

122
00:08:19,397 --> 00:08:21,365
...teach children how to play.

123
00:08:24,603 --> 00:08:26,537
...fuckin' body check.

124
00:08:30,842 --> 00:08:32,673
Watch my fuckin' nuts.

125
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,473
Aw, fuck!

126
00:08:37,582 --> 00:08:38,606
You alright?

127
00:08:38,717 --> 00:08:39,945
Sorry Dean.

128
00:08:40,051 --> 00:08:41,416
Holy shit.

129
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,317
Do you want me to
get you anything.

130
00:08:43,421 --> 00:08:45,252
Dean,
are you alright?

131
00:08:45,357 --> 00:08:47,587
Just fuckin'. Clear
the fuck outta here, okay?

132
00:08:47,692 --> 00:08:49,421
I'm sorry Dean.

133
00:08:49,528 --> 00:08:51,257
You wanna beer?

134
00:08:52,797 --> 00:08:54,958
Terry, you
play goal okay?

135
00:09:04,142 --> 00:09:06,440
Tron.
How's it going buddy?

136
00:09:06,545 --> 00:09:09,844
Sweet. Kick
fuckin' ass! How's it goin?

137
00:09:13,385 --> 00:09:16,354
My name is Troy.

138
00:09:16,454 --> 00:09:22,051
I guess I was kind of uh...
the party... The party leader?

139
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,651
So what are
you up to now man, what are you doing?

140
00:09:24,763 --> 00:09:31,032
I'm welding now, yeah
I got, uh... I got my own shop.

141
00:09:31,136 --> 00:09:36,904
I got Laurie here, and I'm
looking after her, or is it...

142
00:09:37,008 --> 00:09:39,977
...vice versa? I love
those guys you know.

143
00:09:40,078 --> 00:09:45,448
I think they're probably a
couple of the best, best guys...

144
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,778
I've ever run with.

145
00:09:46,885 --> 00:09:48,318
Okay,
we'll get a cube.

146
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,081
We'll fuckin', then
we'll get a two-six.

147
00:09:50,188 --> 00:09:51,587
You wanna Tron?

148
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:52,657
Yeah!

149
00:09:52,757 --> 00:09:54,349
Just like old times, man.

150
00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:57,087
Just fuckin' nail it
shut, like a fuckin', one-two-three fuckin'

151
00:09:57,195 --> 00:09:58,287
...split, right?

152
00:09:58,396 --> 00:09:59,590
I'll swing by.

153
00:09:59,698 --> 00:10:01,131
You know
where we live now?

154
00:10:01,232 --> 00:10:02,221
Yeah.

155
00:10:02,334 --> 00:10:04,199
Troy,
we're already late as it is.

156
00:10:04,302 --> 00:10:06,395
Alright, I'll see ya.
So you coming tonight then?

157
00:10:06,504 --> 00:10:08,369
You should swing
by pretty early, like 7ish...

158
00:10:08,473 --> 00:10:10,270
...or something like
that, half past.

159
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:11,672
No, maybe uh...

160
00:10:11,776 --> 00:10:13,209
No, yeah, you're coming!

161
00:10:13,311 --> 00:10:15,575
You don't gotta work
tomorrow, fuck it.

162
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,012
I'll just say, uh
sorry guys, shuttin'er down...

163
00:10:18,116 --> 00:10:19,708
...uh, no business.

164
00:10:19,818 --> 00:10:21,115
No business!

165
00:10:21,219 --> 00:10:23,483
Not too late,
we'll get started.

166
00:10:23,588 --> 00:10:25,681
Sure, ten after, whenever.

167
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:28,987
Stompin' boots are goin'
on tonight, that's for sure.

168
00:10:31,062 --> 00:10:34,429
Tron's a buddy
we hung out with, like, two years ago.

169
00:10:34,532 --> 00:10:37,899
And we used
to party a lot, but not so much anymore...

170
00:10:38,003 --> 00:10:41,439
...so whenever we do
get together it's fuckin' awesome.

171
00:10:51,783 --> 00:10:54,115
He's gonna be ready
to raise hell...

172
00:10:54,219 --> 00:10:56,517
...like, he's ain't gunna show
up like, "hey guys" he's gunna...

173
00:10:56,621 --> 00:10:59,920
...show up going "whooo!" And we're
gonna be like, "right on. "

174
00:11:06,364 --> 00:11:07,763
I didn't chack.

175
00:11:07,866 --> 00:11:09,265
That's fuckin' embarrassing.

176
00:11:09,367 --> 00:11:11,528
That's an embarrassment
to pilsner.

177
00:11:11,636 --> 00:11:14,070
Look at his
throat move, man.

178
00:11:17,409 --> 00:11:19,741
Right on... You
didn't finish it.

179
00:11:19,844 --> 00:11:22,404
That's absolute
horseshit. I finished that.

180
00:11:22,514 --> 00:11:24,880
I fuckin' finished it.
That rest was foam.

181
00:11:24,983 --> 00:11:28,214
Like, sometimes you go to a party,
right? And everyone's all...

182
00:11:28,319 --> 00:11:31,811
...fuckin' loaded, and you're not
loaded, so you go up to people...

183
00:11:31,923 --> 00:11:34,653
...and you're like, "how's it
goin?" and they're like...

184
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:37,353
'whooooo!" and then you're like
"yeah, okay," and you're trying...

185
00:11:37,462 --> 00:11:39,521
...to talk to them a bit and
they're fuckin' loaded and then...

186
00:11:39,664 --> 00:11:41,962
...you realize, the only way
to keep going is to catch up...

187
00:11:42,067 --> 00:11:45,264
...to them, so you shotgun a few
and then you get good and pissed...

188
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:46,735
...right away.

189
00:11:49,174 --> 00:11:51,267
No, fuck off, fuck off.

190
00:11:57,182 --> 00:12:00,345
Remember last, like,
I don't know, awhile ago...

191
00:12:00,452 --> 00:12:02,010
...the answering
machine was Tron.

192
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,519
And now it's his old lady.

193
00:12:03,621 --> 00:12:05,111
Now it's his fuckin' old lady.

194
00:12:05,223 --> 00:12:07,487
Basically she says,
'if it's not my friends...

195
00:12:07,592 --> 00:12:10,720
...don't fuckin' leave a message'
basically is what she's fuckin' saying.

196
00:12:14,365 --> 00:12:16,663
...fuckin', everybody's just having
a fuckin' wicked time and then...

197
00:12:16,768 --> 00:12:18,565
...it was just like,
fuckin' dead silence.

198
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,864
Laurie came in.

199
00:12:19,971 --> 00:12:21,734
I'm Laurie, she's
like, "Tron"...

200
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,432
...and he just like fuckin'...

201
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:24,769
...stopped, yeah.

202
00:12:24,876 --> 00:12:28,209
Yeah, and he just kinda
like... Hey, did you see that?

203
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,674
You know I really,
and we went through this right...

204
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,344
...in the very beginning,
I really had no problem.

205
00:12:34,452 --> 00:12:37,580
I went through this whole thing
with him, right from the very beginning.

206
00:12:37,689 --> 00:12:40,590
I was with them
periodically here and there, but I...

207
00:12:40,692 --> 00:12:43,786
I honestly couldn't
see myself living that life.

208
00:12:43,895 --> 00:12:46,989
However, it was like,
if this is the only place that it...

209
00:12:47,098 --> 00:12:49,965
...was going, and if it was going
to be a never-ending thing...

210
00:12:50,068 --> 00:12:51,592
I couldn't handle that.

211
00:12:51,703 --> 00:12:55,537
So it was either them or me,
basically, and it was his choice.

212
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,540
Like that, fuckin' nailed...

213
00:12:57,642 --> 00:12:58,631
Fuck off!

214
00:12:58,743 --> 00:13:00,370
That hurt.

215
00:13:00,478 --> 00:13:01,775
Dean!

216
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,780
I think I hurt - Look,
I'm bleeding, man.

217
00:13:03,882 --> 00:13:05,281
What's happing man?

218
00:13:05,383 --> 00:13:06,850
Hey, I'm bleeding.

219
00:13:06,951 --> 00:13:09,818
There's a fuckin'
brain in your hand.

220
00:13:09,921 --> 00:13:14,881
Probably what's happened
I imagine - Dean. Dean.

221
00:13:14,993 --> 00:13:17,257
This is fuckin'
bullshit man.

222
00:13:17,362 --> 00:13:18,829
Yeah I know,
it is bullshit.

223
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:21,558
But we don't have to wreck our
house - watch your fuckin' stick!

224
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:24,533
You know what he's doing, he's
probably got his arm around her...

225
00:13:24,636 --> 00:13:28,003
...and he's probably just like,
"fuck, I wish I wasn't such a...

226
00:13:28,106 --> 00:13:30,074
...slave to my bitch," you know?

227
00:13:30,175 --> 00:13:32,643
I remember a lot of
fun times with Troy.

228
00:13:32,744 --> 00:13:34,177
He's not our buddy.

229
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:35,769
And you know what?

230
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,279
Troy.

231
00:13:37,382 --> 00:13:40,681
Because when he was
our buddy he was fuckin' Tron.

232
00:13:40,785 --> 00:13:44,949
I came up with the name
Tron for myself based on Troy...

233
00:13:45,056 --> 00:13:50,460
...but uh... More,
I guess, imposing.

234
00:13:50,562 --> 00:13:53,497
Let's give him, let's
give him ten minutes, okay?

235
00:13:56,501 --> 00:13:57,661
...fuckin' two-liner!

236
00:13:57,769 --> 00:13:58,793
...fuckin' two-liner!

237
00:13:58,903 --> 00:13:59,870
Two liner!

238
00:13:59,971 --> 00:14:02,337
I'm trying to get
an idea of what you guys did.

239
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:07,275
The things that we did,
it wasn't so much the thing...

240
00:14:07,378 --> 00:14:09,471
...as it was that we did them.

241
00:14:09,581 --> 00:14:11,549
Oh! On the line!
We got one on the line!

242
00:14:11,649 --> 00:14:12,911
Right on.

243
00:14:13,017 --> 00:14:14,678
Right on, it rolled.

244
00:14:14,786 --> 00:14:19,917
It was just living each
day blind and going the distance.

245
00:14:21,726 --> 00:14:23,193
No don't, fuck off.

246
00:14:23,294 --> 00:14:24,818
Watch this, my new move.

247
00:14:24,929 --> 00:14:27,227
Like, I hit rock bottom.

248
00:14:27,332 --> 00:14:30,233
Uh-huh, any fuckin' style.
Come on, come on!

249
00:14:30,335 --> 00:14:32,064
Fight me, you
fuckin' - Come on!

250
00:14:40,778 --> 00:14:43,838
I should just keep,
I should just keep doing that...

251
00:14:43,948 --> 00:14:47,315
...like, till I'm, say, 90 years
old. Okay, yeah, you're right.

252
00:14:47,418 --> 00:14:49,215
I really boned this up.

253
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:53,916
I should never have got,
fallen in love with Laurie...

254
00:14:54,025 --> 00:14:56,220
...for sure, that's a for sure.
Thanks for pointing that out.

255
00:14:56,327 --> 00:14:58,591
And getting a job, yeah,
that was a real left turn.

256
00:14:58,696 --> 00:15:00,596
Where the fuck is Tron?

257
00:15:03,568 --> 00:15:06,969
Fuck Tron man!
You see that? Fuck Tron.

258
00:15:07,071 --> 00:15:08,800
We won't even be here.

259
00:15:08,907 --> 00:15:10,272
Leave a note on the door.

260
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:11,535
That says fuck you Tron!

261
00:15:11,643 --> 00:15:12,974
Fuck you Tron.

262
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:17,712
You're like
I mentioned before, you're like...

263
00:15:17,815 --> 00:15:21,080
...a patriarch to them,
uh, a patriarchal character, and...

264
00:15:21,185 --> 00:15:24,677
They're a patriarch to me, man.

265
00:15:24,789 --> 00:15:26,950
What is Tron for you?

266
00:15:27,058 --> 00:15:28,423
Fuck 'em!

267
00:15:30,962 --> 00:15:32,827
Sometimes I worry.

268
00:15:32,931 --> 00:15:34,990
But I think at some
point in your life you have...

269
00:15:35,099 --> 00:15:37,033
...to grow up, and that's
what Troy's done.

270
00:15:37,135 --> 00:15:39,365
The reason why you're not
getting much from him...

271
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:41,028
...is because of that.

272
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:44,006
Yeah, he's kind of scared
of going back to the old life.

273
00:15:44,108 --> 00:15:46,338
I just have a hard
time having him go out...

274
00:15:46,444 --> 00:15:49,174
...with them because it's so easy
for him to get pulled back...

275
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,340
...into that life. It's a fun life,
that you don't have to have any cares...

276
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:55,283
...in the world. No responsibilities.

277
00:15:55,386 --> 00:15:57,445
Whooo!

278
00:15:57,555 --> 00:15:59,420
Tron!

279
00:16:01,392 --> 00:16:03,223
Tron! Tron!

280
00:16:03,328 --> 00:16:05,353
Whooo!

281
00:16:05,463 --> 00:16:09,263
Tron, we're having
a fuckin' party for ya!

282
00:16:27,318 --> 00:16:28,785
Get up!

283
00:16:28,886 --> 00:16:30,820
Dean, get up.

284
00:16:30,922 --> 00:16:33,823
Get up!

285
00:16:37,695 --> 00:16:39,686
Tron fuckin' blows.

286
00:16:39,797 --> 00:16:43,233
Tron, fuckin', blows.

287
00:16:43,334 --> 00:16:45,598
You know what
this fuckin' says?

288
00:16:45,703 --> 00:16:49,639
It says Tron funking blow.

289
00:16:49,741 --> 00:16:52,039
What the fuck does that mean?

290
00:16:52,143 --> 00:16:56,773
If I have five words left and
I'm about to fuckin' expire...

291
00:16:56,881 --> 00:17:02,148
...and I like, all I have left
to say is to curse fuckin' Tron...

292
00:17:02,253 --> 00:17:05,279
I'm probably not going
to say 'Tron funking blow. '

293
00:17:11,896 --> 00:17:13,830
Get up! Get up!

294
00:17:13,931 --> 00:17:16,957
Terry, my face
is totally bunged up.

295
00:17:58,176 --> 00:18:02,806
You're saying your uncle
was gonna take you on to the...

296
00:18:02,914 --> 00:18:05,712
...on the lake,
because he rented it.

297
00:18:05,817 --> 00:18:09,446
And you know actually
all I remember was like...

298
00:18:09,554 --> 00:18:12,387
...buddy of mine was like...

299
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:17,257
"Hey Dean, dude. "

300
00:18:17,361 --> 00:18:18,726
You know.

301
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:21,094
I was like, "Okay buddy. "

302
00:18:42,086 --> 00:18:43,849
Dean!

303
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:53,052
Terry! Could somebody turn
the stereo down please?

304
00:18:53,164 --> 00:18:54,791
The stereo.

305
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:03,868
I remember Terry and I
got fuckin' right ripped...

306
00:19:03,975 --> 00:19:07,172
...eh Terry? Got fuckin'
right wrecked last night.

307
00:19:07,278 --> 00:19:10,179
If you don't know
a girl so good.

308
00:19:10,281 --> 00:19:11,612
Yeah.

309
00:19:11,716 --> 00:19:13,980
And she's fuckin', doesn't
want to go down on you.

310
00:19:14,085 --> 00:19:15,814
Yeah.

311
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,582
And you're fuckin' tired and you
wanna crash, or you just fuckin'

312
00:19:18,689 --> 00:19:22,591
...want to continue on with your
night, fuckin' diddle her twat...

313
00:19:22,693 --> 00:19:27,460
...fuckin' get her off. Just go
down there and if you know what...

314
00:19:27,565 --> 00:19:31,695
...to do, it'll take probably six,
seven minutes. Well, you go...

315
00:19:31,802 --> 00:19:35,203
...under the panties for sure, and
you just kind of pet it a bit.

316
00:19:35,306 --> 00:19:37,137
Pet what?

317
00:19:37,241 --> 00:19:42,235
Pet... Her fuckin' kneecaps,
Farrel! Pet her twat!

318
00:19:42,346 --> 00:19:45,179
You got something, you got a
twat you want me to diddle?

319
00:19:45,283 --> 00:19:46,716
And that cousin...

320
00:19:46,817 --> 00:19:48,250
Fuck off!

321
00:19:48,352 --> 00:19:51,185
Have you had sexual
intercourse with one of your cousins?

322
00:19:51,289 --> 00:19:52,517
No, fuck you!

323
00:19:52,623 --> 00:19:54,614
Terry fuckin' got one
of his cousins off...

324
00:19:54,725 --> 00:19:56,056
...he fuckin' fingerbanged...

325
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,218
Shut up!

326
00:19:57,328 --> 00:19:59,319
Terry, you fuckin' fingerbanged
your cousin, man, that's a fact.

327
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,796
...fuckin' fingerbanging,
so spill the dirt.

328
00:20:01,899 --> 00:20:03,560
You don't have
to just tell them that!

329
00:20:03,668 --> 00:20:08,662
He was fuckin' loaded, his cousin
came up to him, and he's fuckin'.

330
00:20:08,773 --> 00:20:10,035
Fuck off!

331
00:20:10,141 --> 00:20:13,440
Don't! Don't! Fuck off.

332
00:20:13,544 --> 00:20:15,671
So his fuckin' cousin...
his fuckin' cousin.

333
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:18,806
She says, I'm on my rag,
you just have to finger me.

334
00:20:23,354 --> 00:20:25,549
There,
that's a perfect fit.

335
00:20:25,656 --> 00:20:28,523
What, what? What's your
problem with Dean?

336
00:20:28,626 --> 00:20:30,890
Nothing, I don't have
a problem, just trying...

337
00:20:30,995 --> 00:20:33,463
I have no problem with him
staying here, he's like, my pal.

338
00:20:33,564 --> 00:20:35,225
Are you a
little bit concerned?

339
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:38,769
I seem to see that,
uh, Dean's sleeping, he seems...

340
00:20:38,869 --> 00:20:40,894
...to be sleeping every time
that I come over.

341
00:20:41,005 --> 00:20:45,408
Seems to me that he's taking
advantage of your situation...

342
00:20:45,509 --> 00:20:46,840
...sleeping around...

343
00:20:46,944 --> 00:20:48,502
...he's just, he just needs to...

344
00:20:48,613 --> 00:20:51,275
The house.
Seems like he doesn't care about.

345
00:20:51,382 --> 00:20:55,113
He's sick. He's got cancer.
So you gotta let him do that.

346
00:21:02,426 --> 00:21:03,950
Is this the truth?

347
00:21:04,061 --> 00:21:05,722
Fuck, I told you...

348
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,320
Dean has cancer?

349
00:21:07,431 --> 00:21:09,558
But don't bug him about it.

350
00:21:11,602 --> 00:21:13,263
Hi Dean.

351
00:21:16,474 --> 00:21:21,173
I uh, I was talking
to Terry yesterday.

352
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:25,272
I know that you
have this cancer.

353
00:21:25,383 --> 00:21:27,044
Talked to Terry.

354
00:21:27,151 --> 00:21:28,675
Dean?

355
00:21:31,155 --> 00:21:33,248
Terry told me.

356
00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:41,762
And you're telling me
that I gotta worry about it?

357
00:21:41,866 --> 00:21:43,834
Like, I got something
to worry about?

358
00:21:43,934 --> 00:21:45,367
You're wrong.

359
00:21:45,469 --> 00:21:49,064
Regardless of like, what other
people say, I'm just gonna...

360
00:21:49,173 --> 00:21:53,735
...fuckin' pull 'er off at some
point in time, and just fuckin'

361
00:21:53,844 --> 00:21:56,677
...stick 'er in the microwave
there, see what happens.

362
00:21:56,781 --> 00:21:59,272
See what a fuckin'
blown-up nut looks like.

363
00:21:59,383 --> 00:22:02,250
Let's cut 'er off and fuckin'
put her on the barbecue...

364
00:22:02,353 --> 00:22:05,083
...and fuckin' hibachi that fuckin'
little nut right up, fuckin'

365
00:22:05,189 --> 00:22:08,056
...cover 'er in whatever and
we'll have a tasty treat.

366
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,992
Dean, this
is very serious.

367
00:22:11,095 --> 00:22:13,825
You're going to have to,
gonna have to let yourself...

368
00:22:17,268 --> 00:22:22,501
Well Dean has a lump
in his left testicle, which has...

369
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:25,441
...grown in size to the point
where he can't ignore it.

370
00:22:35,886 --> 00:22:41,153
The strategy is really
to explain to him in rational...

371
00:22:41,258 --> 00:22:45,285
...terms that if he doesn't do
anything, the risk of what's...

372
00:22:45,396 --> 00:22:49,628
...going to happen in the next
five years is certain death.

373
00:22:49,734 --> 00:22:52,134
He has cancer
of the testicle...

374
00:22:52,236 --> 00:22:54,067
...and he won't
listen to me.

375
00:22:54,171 --> 00:22:58,540
He doesn't want to get treatment,
and I want him to try and...

376
00:22:58,642 --> 00:23:03,477
...he, uh, I'm,
I want to help him.

377
00:23:03,581 --> 00:23:06,209
I want him to get treatment.
I know this is terrible.

378
00:23:06,317 --> 00:23:08,512
Is he at home?
When did you talk to him?

379
00:23:08,619 --> 00:23:10,280
When's the last time
you talked to him?

380
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:11,946
Uh... I'm really...

381
00:23:12,056 --> 00:23:13,523
Thanks for telling me.

382
00:23:16,627 --> 00:23:18,151
Trixie!

383
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,461
Dean!

384
00:23:24,568 --> 00:23:26,502
What's going on?

385
00:23:26,604 --> 00:23:28,731
What are you doing
here Farrel?

386
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:30,397
Hi asshole.

387
00:23:30,508 --> 00:23:32,476
What is your problem?

388
00:23:32,576 --> 00:23:35,067
What are you...
what happened?

389
00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:37,340
Why didn't you tell me?

390
00:23:37,448 --> 00:23:38,847
Dean!

391
00:23:38,949 --> 00:23:41,577
He just comes, he just
comes around and tells you.

392
00:23:41,685 --> 00:23:43,516
You think that's
fuckin' funny, Farrel?

393
00:23:43,621 --> 00:23:46,920
What are you trying
to do, just leave Chastity without...

394
00:23:47,024 --> 00:23:49,458
...a dad, hey? You think
that's not important to her?

395
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,460
You think you're
not important to me?

396
00:23:51,562 --> 00:23:53,689
But you're gonna go to the doctor,
and you're gonna get...

397
00:23:53,798 --> 00:23:58,201
...fuckin' treatment.
You could die, do you understand?

398
00:23:58,302 --> 00:23:59,929
You could die.

399
00:24:00,037 --> 00:24:05,065
You know, it's gonna
be pretty pathetic if you fucking die...

400
00:24:05,176 --> 00:24:07,235
...because of your pride.

401
00:24:11,148 --> 00:24:13,013
Alright, I'll go.

402
00:24:13,117 --> 00:24:14,550
Yeah, you'll go.

403
00:24:14,652 --> 00:24:17,086
What? I said I would.
I said I would.

404
00:24:17,188 --> 00:24:18,587
I know you will.

405
00:24:18,689 --> 00:24:20,179
I said I would.

406
00:25:02,399 --> 00:25:05,800
I was working on a
different level with Dean about...

407
00:25:05,903 --> 00:25:09,805
...getting his nuts fixed. Like,
you went right away, like...

408
00:25:09,907 --> 00:25:13,308
...we gotta... But I was going,
every time they would hurt...

409
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:16,379
...or whatever, I would just be like,
oh maybe we should go to the...

410
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,972
...hospital, but really, just, you
know, I didn't want to force it...

411
00:25:20,084 --> 00:25:22,314
...on him or yell at him,
you know, like...

412
00:25:22,419 --> 00:25:24,944
I was gonna take
him to get fixed.

413
00:25:31,562 --> 00:25:36,363
I can't fuckin' baby-sit
my fuckin' giant nut all day...

414
00:25:36,467 --> 00:25:38,731
...you know, just sit there and
watch it and hope it doesn't...

415
00:25:38,836 --> 00:25:43,205
...fuckin' grow. So fuckin' treatment
hurts, well fuck, the second it...

416
00:25:43,307 --> 00:25:46,140
...starts to hurt you're gonna hear
me fuckin' start yelling but as...

417
00:25:46,243 --> 00:25:48,871
...it stands right now,
I feel fine, so.

418
00:25:48,979 --> 00:25:52,437
I'm not a scientist.
I can't fuckin' pull out...

419
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:56,680
...one... A burner and burn up
some stuff and figure it out?

420
00:25:56,787 --> 00:25:59,654
I mean, what do you
want me to do about it?

421
00:25:59,757 --> 00:26:02,385
Worry and get upset? I'll
get cancer from worrying.

422
00:26:02,493 --> 00:26:04,654
Do you believe in God?

423
00:26:04,762 --> 00:26:07,629
Well, fuck rights,
I believe in something.

424
00:26:07,731 --> 00:26:11,132
Like even, a fuckin' guy
like Merlin, you know?

425
00:26:11,235 --> 00:26:14,796
When he died, you know,
whenever the fuck that was...

426
00:26:14,905 --> 00:26:18,238
...he went to heaven, probably,
and you know, and the, the grand...

427
00:26:18,342 --> 00:26:21,505
...scheme being was probably like,
you know, Merlin, you fuckin'

428
00:26:21,612 --> 00:26:24,342
...cast some pretty, you know,
evil shit on some people.

429
00:26:24,448 --> 00:26:26,678
Merlin,
Merlin wasn't real.

430
00:26:26,784 --> 00:26:28,217
Fuck you, Merlin...

431
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:30,617
It's a
story. It's just a story.

432
00:26:30,721 --> 00:26:33,383
No, fuck, Merlin was
part of fuckin' king Henry's...

433
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:35,958
...court, and he fuckin' - They, he
won all the wars for him 'cause...

434
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,620
...he cast spells. Fuck you,
man, that shit's real.

435
00:26:38,729 --> 00:26:41,823
He was - He was part
of King Arthur, not King Henry.

436
00:26:41,932 --> 00:26:44,492
Yeah, it's a fable.
A fable is a... is history.

437
00:26:48,706 --> 00:26:51,368
Yeah, no, lately I have
been sort of on the - On the...

438
00:26:51,475 --> 00:26:55,036
...fucking prowl, yeah. I've sort
of been looking high, low, left...

439
00:26:55,145 --> 00:26:58,410
...centre, right, fuckin' front
and back. I'm talking about...

440
00:26:58,515 --> 00:27:01,348
...you know, spreading Deaner
around, fuckin' get the murdoch...

441
00:27:01,452 --> 00:27:03,317
...kids, you know, get 'em going.

442
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:06,583
I'm one of those guys who's
like, too forward, you know?

443
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:12,560
Watch the fuckin' road, buddy?
Huh? D'you see that guy?

444
00:27:12,663 --> 00:27:14,688
Yeah, I saw him.
I told you about him.

445
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:16,732
It's not
fuckin' funny, man!

446
00:27:16,834 --> 00:27:19,428
And some guy fuckin' sideswipes
him and it's two, three...

447
00:27:19,536 --> 00:27:21,504
...thousand dollars worth of
fuckin' paintjob...

448
00:27:21,605 --> 00:27:22,936
Let's go.

449
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,372
I'm not doing this, I'm
not doing this for me, you know...

450
00:27:25,476 --> 00:27:28,172
I'm sort of doing it for
like, all the girls out there...

451
00:27:28,278 --> 00:27:30,872
...who, you know, if I'm gone, you
know, they won't have a chance...

452
00:27:30,981 --> 00:27:32,778
...to see old Deaner.

453
00:27:32,883 --> 00:27:36,148
Just, like, once a week I like
to have this thing where...

454
00:27:36,253 --> 00:27:39,916
...like, I buy like, whatever,
like a Heineken or a fuckin'

455
00:27:40,024 --> 00:27:43,152
Corona or like - A beer you
don't normally see, and actually...

456
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:46,161
I've been keeping them in
Terry's kitchen. Would you mind...

457
00:27:46,263 --> 00:27:48,424
...maybe like, checking -
'cause I could show you.

458
00:27:48,532 --> 00:27:49,965
Okay, yeah!

459
00:27:50,067 --> 00:27:52,092
I have probably like
eight or nine of them...

460
00:27:52,202 --> 00:27:53,567
There from, like...

461
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:54,968
Hey, Dean.

462
00:27:55,072 --> 00:27:56,903
- Literally from all
over the fuckin' country...

463
00:27:57,007 --> 00:27:58,941
Yeah, they're from all
over the world. There's some...

464
00:27:59,043 --> 00:28:02,035
...from Paris and actually there's
some, actually from Ireland.

465
00:28:18,996 --> 00:28:22,591
I ain't gonna fuckin' die,
Farrel. All right?

466
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:27,194
And you know, you don't need
to be so worried about it, man...

467
00:28:27,304 --> 00:28:30,137
...just fuckin' relax about it, kay?

468
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,435
'Cause I ain't
fuckin' goin' down!

469
00:28:32,543 --> 00:28:35,444
I have a poem, would you
like me to read you his poem?

470
00:28:35,546 --> 00:28:37,537
Yes, yes, of course.

471
00:28:37,648 --> 00:28:40,776
'Woman is a danger cat'
the streets are silent my wills...

472
00:28:40,884 --> 00:28:44,217
...are the night black leather
blues calling out to you a cute...

473
00:28:44,321 --> 00:28:47,017
...blonde boogie machine
spreads her wings...

474
00:28:47,124 --> 00:28:49,285
...and comes along for the ride.

475
00:28:49,393 --> 00:28:51,861
It's the only song
I ever really wrote for...

476
00:28:51,962 --> 00:28:53,589
...like the acoustic guitar.

477
00:29:05,242 --> 00:29:09,770
Rock
and roll is my guitar...

478
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:13,213
...and girls electricity...

479
00:29:13,317 --> 00:29:16,309
...and if I've got both of them...

480
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:19,514
I've got all, all I need...

481
00:29:19,623 --> 00:29:23,150
I could live life without liquor...

482
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:26,195
I know that it'd be hard...

483
00:29:26,296 --> 00:29:29,754
...but a life without
girls and rock'n'roll...

484
00:29:29,867 --> 00:29:32,768
...would break my heart.

485
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:40,675
'cause rock and roll ain't a
game you can stop at anytime...

486
00:29:40,778 --> 00:29:46,410
...it's a really serious
thing like war and crime...

487
00:29:46,517 --> 00:29:52,217
...rock and roll ain't a game
where you know all the rules...

488
00:29:52,322 --> 00:29:55,883
...you gotta pick up
your guitar and play...

489
00:29:55,993 --> 00:29:59,224
...and play the fool...

490
00:29:59,329 --> 00:30:02,457
Your father thinks
you're out at Suzy's place...

491
00:30:02,566 --> 00:30:05,399
...bowling on the classics but
everyone at high school knows...

492
00:30:05,502 --> 00:30:09,199
...you're heavy into gymnastics
one-way street, never mind...

493
00:30:09,306 --> 00:30:12,935
...the signs full charged gasoline
in the tank you're foot is on...

494
00:30:13,043 --> 00:30:16,535
...the gas and your tires say,
yeah. Woman is a danger cat.

495
00:30:41,905 --> 00:30:44,897
You sneak out at night
deep into the night there ain't...

496
00:30:45,008 --> 00:30:48,136
...no halfway house you come
from good blood, right?

497
00:30:48,245 --> 00:30:51,703
On and on, woman is a danger
cat. It's kind of a funny...

498
00:30:51,815 --> 00:30:54,784
...little poem and it shows how
Dean's thinking is kind...

499
00:30:54,885 --> 00:30:57,183
...of cuckoo sometimes.

500
00:31:05,095 --> 00:31:09,725
Dean is a little bit
hesitant, he is not fully on...

501
00:31:09,833 --> 00:31:14,293
...onstream as far as, uh,
giving his consent to go ahead.

502
00:31:14,404 --> 00:31:16,235
You can understand this.

503
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:21,937
I mean, we're offering him loss
of a body part, and as far as...

504
00:31:22,045 --> 00:31:24,912
...he's concerned if he can pretend
to ignore what is going on...

505
00:31:25,015 --> 00:31:28,815
...he can make it in his own
mind to preserve his body part.

506
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:32,286
He's gonna say, the best thing
is not to have anything to do...

507
00:31:32,389 --> 00:31:35,825
...with what this guy is telling
me. That's, we call that denial...

508
00:31:35,926 --> 00:31:38,793
...and we all do that to some
degree. And he's scared.

509
00:31:43,901 --> 00:31:45,698
...fuckin' take it?

510
00:31:45,802 --> 00:31:47,463
Or what?

511
00:31:47,571 --> 00:31:51,905
Right now, fuckin' pull it out.

512
00:31:52,009 --> 00:31:54,000
I can take it.

513
00:31:54,111 --> 00:31:55,908
They don't get it.

514
00:31:56,013 --> 00:31:57,708
What?

515
00:31:57,814 --> 00:32:00,749
You wanna take me?

516
00:32:00,851 --> 00:32:02,842
You gotta come now!

517
00:32:02,953 --> 00:32:06,719
I don't remember asking
you any questions.

518
00:32:06,823 --> 00:32:09,917
Can I borrow it for a minute?

519
00:32:10,027 --> 00:32:15,590
I'll borrow your left nut,
right nut, fuckin' nutty nut!

520
00:32:15,699 --> 00:32:19,396
Bring it on, fuckin' come on!

521
00:32:19,503 --> 00:32:21,437
Shower the fucker, huh?

522
00:32:21,538 --> 00:32:24,598
Shower the fucker!
Shower that fucker!

523
00:32:24,708 --> 00:32:26,767
Shower that fucker!

524
00:32:26,877 --> 00:32:31,576
...fuckin' showering it on it!
fuckin' give it giv'er.

525
00:32:31,682 --> 00:32:35,118
Whaaaaaat?

526
00:32:35,218 --> 00:32:40,212
I saw that, bring it
down here, right here.

527
00:32:40,324 --> 00:32:42,519
Showery shower!

528
00:32:42,626 --> 00:32:44,958
Chicken, kickin', come on!

529
00:32:48,065 --> 00:32:52,832
He is very near death,
and at one point, you decide to...

530
00:32:52,936 --> 00:33:00,433
...tell him, before he dies,
those last words, those last things...

531
00:33:00,544 --> 00:33:05,481
...that you would like to tell him,
so that those are the last...

532
00:33:05,582 --> 00:33:13,284
...things that he hears,
in his ears, before he dies in front...

533
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:17,258
...of you. What would you say?

534
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:30,135
I'd just fuckin' tell him that
he was like one of the like...

535
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:35,473
...you know, best friends
I've ever had, and that...

536
00:33:35,579 --> 00:33:39,071
...it would have been pretty
fuckin' boring without him.

537
00:33:43,854 --> 00:33:46,914
I think. Oh yeah,
fuck he's right there.

538
00:33:47,024 --> 00:33:48,514
There he is.

539
00:33:48,625 --> 00:33:49,887
Hey, man.

540
00:33:49,993 --> 00:33:51,893
Oh, it's going okay.

541
00:33:51,995 --> 00:33:53,257
Right on.

542
00:33:53,363 --> 00:33:56,890
Well, basically... Fuck.

543
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,525
You don't have to tell me.

544
00:34:11,381 --> 00:34:13,212
They're cutting
my fuckin' nut off.

545
00:34:13,316 --> 00:34:14,840
Cutting your nut off?

546
00:34:14,951 --> 00:34:16,680
My right nut.

547
00:34:16,787 --> 00:34:21,087
I guess so it don't spread
they're just gonna fuckin'...

548
00:34:21,191 --> 00:34:23,386
Giv'er.

549
00:34:23,493 --> 00:34:29,193
We had it biopsied. It
confirms the presence of cancer...

550
00:34:29,299 --> 00:34:33,258
...and so he urgently needs to
have an operation to remove...

551
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:36,999
...the testicle, which is the standard
surgical treatment for this kind...

552
00:34:37,107 --> 00:34:41,339
...of cancer of the testicle.
Then he needs to undergo chemotherapy...

553
00:34:41,445 --> 00:34:43,106
...and radiotherapy.

554
00:34:43,213 --> 00:34:47,115
I was thinking Terry,
we should fuckin' do'er.

555
00:34:47,217 --> 00:34:51,483
This weekend, man, just fuckin'
have a fuckin', one last fuckin'...

556
00:34:51,588 --> 00:34:54,182
'cause, like, I'm gonna be out
of commission for awhile...

557
00:34:54,291 --> 00:34:59,126
I guess after I get my nut
wrought off there, they gotta...

558
00:34:59,229 --> 00:35:03,427
...fuckin' shoot me full of like,
lots of electricity and shit...

559
00:35:03,533 --> 00:35:08,596
...and it's gonna affect my overall
fuckin' ability to be normal.

560
00:35:08,705 --> 00:35:12,835
Aaaaaaaaaa-ooooooooooo!
Dean's last fuckin' weekend!

561
00:35:12,943 --> 00:35:14,467
Aoooooooo!

562
00:35:14,578 --> 00:35:18,207
If we act now,
we can offer him better than...

563
00:35:18,315 --> 00:35:20,943
50-60 percent survival.

564
00:35:21,051 --> 00:35:23,918
You gotta get loaded
too, or else you can't come.

565
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:27,251
Told you. Yeah?
He fuckin' said yes!

566
00:35:27,357 --> 00:35:28,790
Right on.

567
00:35:28,892 --> 00:35:31,019
He's gonna
get fuckin' rip-roaring loaded.

568
00:35:31,128 --> 00:35:33,494
Uh, I don't know
about rip-roaring loaded.

569
00:35:33,597 --> 00:35:35,326
That's the deal!
Yeah, you are!

570
00:35:35,432 --> 00:35:37,161
Oh, I guess
you're not coming!

571
00:35:39,836 --> 00:35:43,499
Gonna get
lo-o-o-o-aded, going camping!

572
00:35:43,607 --> 00:35:50,069
You're surrounded by beautiful
trees, and a fuckin' canopy...

573
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:53,843
...of stars above ya,
it's a fuckin' real vista.

574
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:55,144
Yeah.

575
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:59,152
Did you hear that?

576
00:35:59,256 --> 00:36:02,248
Fuck! That fucking stinks!

577
00:36:02,359 --> 00:36:04,327
Hang on, I think mine's stuck.

578
00:36:04,427 --> 00:36:06,793
Fuck off!

579
00:36:06,897 --> 00:36:08,990
I've been a
farter all of my life.

580
00:36:09,099 --> 00:36:10,259
Fuck.

581
00:36:10,367 --> 00:36:12,028
I guess, I don't know what it is.

582
00:36:12,135 --> 00:36:14,626
Each, every time I eat fried
egg sandwiches, egg salad...

583
00:36:14,738 --> 00:36:16,365
I think it's stuck in the seat.

584
00:36:16,473 --> 00:36:18,907
Or even potato salad,
anything with mayonnaise really.

585
00:36:19,009 --> 00:36:20,340
Fuck off.

586
00:36:20,443 --> 00:36:23,378
That's just gross, like
'Oh, I have an idea...

587
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,414
I'll shit my pants
in the car. '

588
00:36:25,515 --> 00:36:28,678
The second that I farted
I thought, oh, Terry's mom's place.

589
00:36:28,785 --> 00:36:30,616
That's what I, that's exact.

590
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,622
Must be some, must be something
cooking at Terry's mom's place.

591
00:36:37,561 --> 00:36:40,621
Fuck off! Fuck off Dean.

592
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:44,188
I'm gonna fuckin' puke
if you do that again.

593
00:36:44,301 --> 00:36:46,064
Aw, fuck!

594
00:36:46,169 --> 00:36:47,796
Fuck you, that's fuckin' gross!

595
00:36:47,904 --> 00:36:49,394
Get the fuck out.

596
00:36:49,506 --> 00:36:51,337
I'm serious.

597
00:36:51,441 --> 00:36:53,875
Get the fuck out.

598
00:36:55,612 --> 00:36:57,773
Are you sure
you should be doing this, Terry?

599
00:37:03,353 --> 00:37:06,584
...fuckin' asshole. I mean
fuck, he's just laughing away...

600
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:09,215
...shitting his pants in here.
I don't care if he's sick...

601
00:37:09,326 --> 00:37:12,762
...you don't shit your pants in
someone's car. That's horseshit...

602
00:37:12,862 --> 00:37:17,959
Really. I want him to remember
it. So how does he remember it?

603
00:37:18,068 --> 00:37:20,502
He fuckin' walks to the town,
and we'll wait for him.

604
00:37:25,175 --> 00:37:26,767
Dean!

605
00:37:26,876 --> 00:37:30,141
I mean, imagine I kicked him
out and then drove back and...

606
00:37:30,247 --> 00:37:32,681
...said, okay, walk to the town and
then I'll - And then it'll be...

607
00:37:32,782 --> 00:37:36,548
...okay, and I couldn't back it
up, I mean, what does that say...

608
00:37:36,653 --> 00:37:38,018
...about me?

609
00:37:38,121 --> 00:37:40,248
I don't know.
What does it say?

610
00:37:40,357 --> 00:37:42,621
It says, it says
you can shit in my mouth.

611
00:37:42,726 --> 00:37:46,059
Okay, okay,
I understand what he did.

612
00:37:54,204 --> 00:37:58,607
Well, I'm thinking
like, if we don't get you know...

613
00:37:58,708 --> 00:38:07,309
...to go camping I'm gonna feel
bad about it later on, you know.

614
00:38:07,417 --> 00:38:11,547
I mean, whoever did what wrong
back there is not important...

615
00:38:11,655 --> 00:38:16,854
...anymore. It's more aboutjust doing
what we wanted to do...

616
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,860
...go camping.

617
00:38:22,332 --> 00:38:24,493
Oh there he is,
I knew it. I knew it.

618
00:38:28,471 --> 00:38:30,871
A spare
is when you get...

619
00:38:30,974 --> 00:38:32,305
Dean!

620
00:38:32,409 --> 00:38:36,311
- One with one ball,
like, some with one ball...

621
00:38:36,413 --> 00:38:38,381
...and the rest with the other.

622
00:38:38,481 --> 00:38:40,073
Oh, yeah, yeah.

623
00:38:42,952 --> 00:38:44,852
That's what I'm talking about.

624
00:38:44,954 --> 00:38:46,854
Yeah, that's a strike.

625
00:38:46,956 --> 00:38:49,720
See, practice
makes perfect, there.

626
00:38:49,826 --> 00:38:52,886
And then buddy's like,
where do you want me to drop you off.

627
00:38:52,996 --> 00:38:54,691
I was like, I don't know.

628
00:38:54,798 --> 00:38:56,493
These guys figured I couldn't
find you, but I was like...

629
00:38:56,599 --> 00:38:57,998
I'll find him.

630
00:38:58,101 --> 00:39:01,696
So what I did was
uh, I bowled with my left.

631
00:39:01,805 --> 00:39:04,933
And that one chick, the one
with the glasses, she beat me.

632
00:39:05,041 --> 00:39:08,101
I would say that the
fuckin' best burger I ever had...

633
00:39:08,211 --> 00:39:12,910
...was at a bowling alley, 'cause,
they surprise you there, some...

634
00:39:13,016 --> 00:39:17,009
...of them alleys hire, fuck, some
of the best cooks, and they don't...

635
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,816
...they ain't a restaurant
but that doesn't mean that...

636
00:39:19,923 --> 00:39:22,824
...the cook ain't gonna put some
fuckin' pride in their burgers.

637
00:39:22,926 --> 00:39:24,621
Bindair dundat.

638
00:39:24,728 --> 00:39:27,663
Been there, done that.

639
00:39:27,764 --> 00:39:30,631
That's the paki who's fuckin'
seen everything and gone everywhere.

640
00:39:30,734 --> 00:39:32,759
What's a paki?

641
00:39:32,869 --> 00:39:37,329
I don't know, yeah,
a guy from India...

642
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,964
...sounds about right to me.

643
00:39:39,075 --> 00:39:40,770
Where's Pakistan?

644
00:39:40,877 --> 00:39:43,277
No, you were alluding
to something else.

645
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:46,008
I worked with one guy
that had the turban...

646
00:39:46,116 --> 00:39:50,746
...on his head, and I mean, you
know whatever, he was a Paki...

647
00:39:50,854 --> 00:39:52,583
...and that was his, you know...

648
00:39:52,689 --> 00:39:54,850
This is fuckin' it!

649
00:39:54,958 --> 00:39:56,755
Yeah man!

650
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,452
Whooooooo!

651
00:39:58,561 --> 00:40:00,358
Right here,
get that smell?

652
00:40:00,463 --> 00:40:01,794
You smell that Farrel?

653
00:40:01,898 --> 00:40:03,422
That's fuckin'
camping, right there.

654
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:14,941
First things first...

655
00:40:15,011 --> 00:40:17,707
...more cheers more beers,
man, that's it, that's all.

656
00:40:17,814 --> 00:40:22,410
To there - To my right nut,
man - See ya later, fella.

657
00:40:22,519 --> 00:40:24,419
Unpacking.

658
00:40:28,458 --> 00:40:30,323
Watch, I'm going camping.

659
00:40:30,427 --> 00:40:31,894
Let's go camping.

660
00:40:31,995 --> 00:40:33,462
Who's taking a plane?

661
00:40:33,563 --> 00:40:34,962
Come on, roughin' it!

662
00:40:35,064 --> 00:40:37,760
Oh, just some supplies
you know in case, uh, we run...

663
00:40:37,867 --> 00:40:39,596
...into some rough spots, uh.

664
00:40:47,076 --> 00:40:48,771
No! Fuck off!

665
00:40:51,848 --> 00:40:53,247
Whoooah, fuck!

666
00:40:53,349 --> 00:40:54,680
Whooo!

667
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:56,183
Farrel, just sit down.

668
00:40:56,286 --> 00:40:57,583
Have a chocolate bar.

669
00:40:57,687 --> 00:41:00,247
Chocolate bar, now look
- Put your hands like this...

670
00:41:00,356 --> 00:41:01,721
...on the fire.

671
00:41:10,066 --> 00:41:12,227
Oh fuck, that's a hot one.

672
00:41:12,335 --> 00:41:15,930
You gotta get real low,
'cause heat rises eh?

673
00:41:16,039 --> 00:41:19,031
If you can think of a better
way to get this on the fire...

674
00:41:19,142 --> 00:41:20,803
I'd like to see it.

675
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:22,605
Fuck, hold on.

676
00:41:22,712 --> 00:41:25,408
'Kay, I think what we gotta
do is undo the bolts first.

677
00:41:25,515 --> 00:41:27,312
No, no, no.

678
00:41:33,022 --> 00:41:35,047
Fuck, that's perfect.

679
00:41:35,158 --> 00:41:37,991
Deaner'll just go right over!

680
00:41:40,763 --> 00:41:42,162
Did you see that?

681
00:41:42,265 --> 00:41:44,790
I'm not
doing a nudie jump.

682
00:41:49,873 --> 00:41:51,966
You're fucking
things up, Dean!

683
00:41:54,377 --> 00:41:58,677
Man, I could go for a
fuckin' smoke right fuckin' now.

684
00:41:58,781 --> 00:42:01,807
No, you quit, remember?
Do you have any dip?

685
00:42:04,721 --> 00:42:06,211
No, no, fuck, listen.

686
00:42:06,322 --> 00:42:07,687
I am.

687
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:09,519
Think about
there's that one day every year...

688
00:42:09,626 --> 00:42:11,787
...that fuckin' clicks by.

689
00:42:11,895 --> 00:42:13,294
Like Christmas?

690
00:42:13,396 --> 00:42:16,194
Yeah, no, exactly, like
Christmas, except for you don't...

691
00:42:16,299 --> 00:42:19,735
...know it's Christmas. It's like,
you know, like, let's say...

692
00:42:19,836 --> 00:42:22,703
...you die on like, August
fuckin' 10th or something.

693
00:42:22,805 --> 00:42:24,033
Right?

694
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:25,801
Right, but you don't
know that, right?

695
00:42:25,909 --> 00:42:27,843
That August 10th
is the day you die?

696
00:42:27,944 --> 00:42:30,276
Yeah, but every fuckin' year
from the day you're born...

697
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:32,473
...you know, August
10th clicks by...

698
00:42:32,582 --> 00:42:35,244
...but you never put
it together like in a journal...

699
00:42:35,351 --> 00:42:39,287
But like, fuck, man, every
single year goes by, you know...

700
00:42:39,389 --> 00:42:42,620
...anniversary, I guess,
of your death goes by.

701
00:42:42,725 --> 00:42:44,784
There you go Farrel.

702
00:42:44,894 --> 00:42:46,589
Nice work, Pal.

703
00:42:46,696 --> 00:42:48,254
Hey, look at that.

704
00:42:48,364 --> 00:42:50,127
Look, he's doing okay.

705
00:42:50,233 --> 00:42:52,701
Oh, oh, oh,
oh, you got it.

706
00:42:52,802 --> 00:42:54,269
Look, his throat's going.

707
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:56,065
Spitting a little bit.

708
00:42:56,172 --> 00:42:59,107
Oh, you want me to
finish that one off there?

709
00:42:59,208 --> 00:43:01,005
Here, I'll have
a sip of that.

710
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:02,634
Can I ask you a question?

711
00:43:02,745 --> 00:43:04,372
Here, yeah, here.

712
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,243
Who touched my throat?

713
00:43:06,349 --> 00:43:08,510
How's your movie
going tonight so far?

714
00:43:08,618 --> 00:43:10,609
Terry, you wanna
do the old can test?

715
00:43:12,455 --> 00:43:14,719
Little or no reaction!

716
00:43:14,824 --> 00:43:20,353
Looks like Farrel's
had a few too many.

717
00:43:20,463 --> 00:43:22,158
Hey Farrel.

718
00:43:22,265 --> 00:43:24,062
Yeah Farrel.

719
00:43:26,769 --> 00:43:29,761
The light is up,
and it is up for me.

720
00:43:33,176 --> 00:43:35,076
Hey Farrel,
we got one here.

721
00:43:35,178 --> 00:43:37,874
We just gotta shake
it up and giv'er.

722
00:43:37,981 --> 00:43:40,745
You can feel 'er giving.

723
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:42,044
Yeah.

724
00:43:42,151 --> 00:43:43,550
Come on, Farrel.

725
00:43:43,653 --> 00:43:45,484
Yeah, we can do it.

726
00:43:45,588 --> 00:43:46,919
Alright.

727
00:43:47,023 --> 00:43:49,048
We'll go find to
gather another tree.

728
00:43:49,158 --> 00:43:50,887
There we go.

729
00:43:50,994 --> 00:43:52,393
Coming down!

730
00:43:52,495 --> 00:43:53,985
Coming down!

731
00:43:58,401 --> 00:44:00,028
This is a tree!

732
00:44:00,136 --> 00:44:02,570
That's coming down! Aaaaah!

733
00:44:02,672 --> 00:44:05,664
A tree is a tree, not me!

734
00:44:05,775 --> 00:44:07,037
Tree!

735
00:44:07,143 --> 00:44:08,770
Do you see this guy's pants?

736
00:44:08,878 --> 00:44:10,709
See this guy's pants?
C'mere, c'mere.

737
00:44:10,813 --> 00:44:11,711
Fuck off!

738
00:44:11,814 --> 00:44:12,712
His pants is very tight...

739
00:44:12,815 --> 00:44:13,839
Hey...

740
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:15,315
He has very tight pants.

741
00:44:15,418 --> 00:44:17,113
Fuck off Farrel!

742
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:23,158
I want, I want some wood.

743
00:44:23,259 --> 00:44:24,954
It happened to be wood!

744
00:44:25,061 --> 00:44:28,189
It happened to be wood, one day!

745
00:44:31,034 --> 00:44:32,934
Hey Farrel?

746
00:44:33,036 --> 00:44:35,527
Yes Terry?

747
00:44:39,042 --> 00:44:42,102
What do you do
when you don't make movies?

748
00:44:42,211 --> 00:44:44,839
That's a good question.

749
00:44:44,947 --> 00:44:47,609
What do you do period Farrel,
what the fuck, like?

750
00:44:47,717 --> 00:44:49,548
You're just following us around...

751
00:44:49,652 --> 00:44:52,951
...like it's the be all and the end
all of the fucking universe, eh?

752
00:44:53,056 --> 00:44:54,819
Do you
think that's my life?

753
00:44:54,924 --> 00:44:58,087
Is that what you think?
Is that what you think?

754
00:45:00,797 --> 00:45:04,198
What do you do on
your spare time?

755
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:06,359
Is what I meant to say.

756
00:45:06,469 --> 00:45:09,097
What do I do on my spare time?

757
00:45:09,205 --> 00:45:12,265
I don't know,
You make pornos with fuckin' midgets?

758
00:45:12,375 --> 00:45:15,139
I don't know what the fuck
the guy does with these cameras...

759
00:45:15,244 --> 00:45:16,871
...when he's not doing...

760
00:45:16,979 --> 00:45:20,471
Do you
understand what it means...

761
00:45:20,583 --> 00:45:25,452
...to put time into something,
to develop something, that's not...

762
00:45:25,555 --> 00:45:30,686
...necessarily, you know, going
to work and making a table?

763
00:45:30,793 --> 00:45:34,422
I just play the bass
and, I'm an artist too Farrel...

764
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:35,997
I know how you feel.

765
00:45:36,099 --> 00:45:39,262
I'm just trying to look at you.
You don't even understand what...

766
00:45:39,368 --> 00:45:41,836
I'm trying to do
for both of you.

767
00:45:41,938 --> 00:45:44,907
Without me and Terry,
you wouldn't have a fuckin' movie.

768
00:45:45,007 --> 00:45:47,305
Yeah, sure,
exactly, like you don't think...

769
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:49,002
...that there's two other
people like you two?

770
00:45:49,112 --> 00:45:51,672
If it weren't for me right now,
where would you be?

771
00:45:51,781 --> 00:45:52,873
Probably right here.

772
00:45:52,982 --> 00:45:54,381
Right here.

773
00:45:54,484 --> 00:45:56,042
When they say cut,
we just keep...

774
00:45:56,185 --> 00:45:57,709
Terry and me just keep going.

775
00:45:57,820 --> 00:45:59,811
Sit down and we'll ask
you some questions.

776
00:45:59,922 --> 00:46:02,015
No, no, no, how
about you do something for me?

777
00:46:02,125 --> 00:46:03,524
How about you listen to me?

778
00:46:03,626 --> 00:46:05,059
Farrel sit the fuck down.

779
00:46:05,161 --> 00:46:06,594
You fuckin' spit at me?

780
00:46:06,696 --> 00:46:08,254
Don't fuckin' touch me,Farrel.

781
00:46:08,364 --> 00:46:09,695
Put your hand down.

782
00:46:09,799 --> 00:46:11,391
Take five, Farrel.

783
00:46:11,501 --> 00:46:12,729
You see that?

784
00:46:14,537 --> 00:46:16,767
Try it, try it you fuck.

785
00:46:16,873 --> 00:46:19,467
Oh no. I think Farrel's
had a few too many.

786
00:46:19,575 --> 00:46:21,668
C'mere,
come on, both of you!

787
00:46:24,113 --> 00:46:26,581
You gotta take
a serious five, Farrel.

788
00:46:26,682 --> 00:46:32,018
No, it's a fuckin'
joke your whole life.

789
00:46:32,121 --> 00:46:35,420
You don't even
fuckin' understand...

790
00:46:35,525 --> 00:46:37,288
...what your fuckin' life is about.

791
00:46:37,393 --> 00:46:39,088
Oh, that
didn't feel good.

792
00:46:39,195 --> 00:46:41,163
You got
a serious fuckin' problem.

793
00:46:41,264 --> 00:46:42,856
Don't fuckin'...

794
00:46:42,965 --> 00:46:45,525
You fuckin' know
what it's about?

795
00:46:45,635 --> 00:46:48,798
Yeah, hey, Farrel,
no, I got an idea. How about...

796
00:46:48,905 --> 00:46:51,203
...you ruin my last fuckin'
weekend by being a total...

797
00:46:51,307 --> 00:46:53,775
...fuckin' idiot?
How bout that?

798
00:46:53,876 --> 00:46:55,241
Fuck this.

799
00:46:55,344 --> 00:46:57,039
I got a good
idea. Hey Terry!

800
00:46:57,146 --> 00:46:59,944
Bring a few tissues,
ya fuckin' baby!

801
00:47:10,026 --> 00:47:11,926
Fuck that chair up.

802
00:47:27,443 --> 00:47:28,842
Fuck it.

803
00:48:30,673 --> 00:48:32,834
...fuckin' grade a pork.

804
00:48:32,942 --> 00:48:34,603
You get all the dogs?

805
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:36,701
She said just
to fuckin' take 'em.

806
00:48:36,812 --> 00:48:38,302
I don't want a dog yet.

807
00:48:38,414 --> 00:48:40,177
Oh, now I'm fuckin' scared.

808
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,779
Oh, that's gonna be tasty.

809
00:49:00,937 --> 00:49:04,202
Farrel? Farrel?

810
00:49:08,978 --> 00:49:10,912
Where am I?

811
00:49:11,013 --> 00:49:14,141
You're in a ditch.

812
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:17,617
Went on a bit of a
bender last night, bud.

813
00:49:23,159 --> 00:49:24,387
Don't...

814
00:49:24,493 --> 00:49:26,620
...don't, don't do that.

815
00:49:26,729 --> 00:49:28,594
This'll help you out.

816
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,297
Don't, please.

817
00:49:35,404 --> 00:49:37,463
Don't worry about it,
this is gonna...

818
00:49:37,573 --> 00:49:40,440
Tonight's gonna be
even better, so don't fuckin' stress'er.

819
00:49:40,543 --> 00:49:42,568
You get all the bugs
out the first night...

820
00:49:42,678 --> 00:49:45,511
...you know, and then you get
really back into camping...

821
00:49:45,614 --> 00:49:47,809
...and then the second
night's just fuckin'...

822
00:49:47,917 --> 00:49:51,353
'cause we didn't start
givin'er until around seven...

823
00:49:51,454 --> 00:49:54,651
...or eight. Tonight we'll
be loaded, well, 'cause, you know...

824
00:49:54,757 --> 00:49:57,726
...what the fuck. What is it,
what time did you say it is, 12:30?

825
00:49:57,827 --> 00:49:59,852
Yeah,
it's about 20 after.

826
00:49:59,962 --> 00:50:02,226
How would
you guys feel if I were to...

827
00:50:02,331 --> 00:50:07,462
...if I were to treat you guys
for tonight, if we go to hotel.

828
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:10,539
You could get anything you want.

829
00:50:13,776 --> 00:50:16,210
You fuckin' serious?

830
00:50:16,312 --> 00:50:19,179
After the hotel we
still have to go for a hike.

831
00:50:19,281 --> 00:50:21,112
Yes, we can do that.

832
00:50:21,217 --> 00:50:24,584
'Cause there's this fuckin'
kick-ass place to go for a swim.

833
00:50:24,687 --> 00:50:28,919
It's not, it's not so super-
close to here, but it's fuckin'...

834
00:50:29,025 --> 00:50:32,017
...it's the, it's
the place to be, man.

835
00:50:32,128 --> 00:50:34,062
Okay, that
sounds really nice.

836
00:50:34,163 --> 00:50:36,222
And tonight we'll
stay in a hotel.

837
00:50:48,644 --> 00:50:49,804
Dean.

838
00:50:49,912 --> 00:50:51,038
Let's giv'er.

839
00:50:51,147 --> 00:50:52,239
Dean.

840
00:50:52,348 --> 00:50:53,747
Let's fuckin' go.

841
00:50:53,849 --> 00:50:55,874
No, the wardens clean it up.

842
00:50:55,985 --> 00:50:59,318
You're not legal
to shut your fuckin' mouth yet.

843
00:51:13,302 --> 00:51:16,669
The doctor said that I'd
be weak. He said that I would be...

844
00:51:16,772 --> 00:51:20,503
...lacking in a lot of things,
that my sexual activity...

845
00:51:20,609 --> 00:51:23,510
...was definitely going to go down,
which is sort of why this...

846
00:51:23,612 --> 00:51:26,604
...this weekend I was kind of hoping
that something would happen...

847
00:51:26,715 --> 00:51:29,980
...but uh, you know, just
sort of get one in the bag...

848
00:51:30,086 --> 00:51:32,953
...before, uh, you know,
there's a hole in it.

849
00:51:34,290 --> 00:51:36,258
Where the fuck
are we going?

850
00:51:36,292 --> 00:51:37,759
Can you turn this
way? Here, see, right there.

851
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:39,623
The Motor Motel.

852
00:51:39,728 --> 00:51:41,662
Housekeeping
award winners.

853
00:51:49,538 --> 00:51:51,199
Like going home or something?

854
00:51:51,307 --> 00:51:53,673
No, I'm just out
and about, cruising around...

855
00:51:53,776 --> 00:51:55,175
...enjoying the weather.

856
00:51:55,277 --> 00:51:57,074
Oh yeah,
it was nice today.

857
00:51:57,179 --> 00:51:59,113
Now that it's not
a 1,000 degrees out.

858
00:51:59,215 --> 00:52:00,807
Man, that was hot!

859
00:52:00,916 --> 00:52:03,077
I was in the river there
soaking for a while.

860
00:52:03,185 --> 00:52:04,982
Is that the
big plant here?

861
00:52:05,087 --> 00:52:06,679
Yeah, it's cutting meat here.

862
00:52:06,789 --> 00:52:08,086
Oh yeah?

863
00:52:08,190 --> 00:52:09,680
4,000 pounds a day.

864
00:52:09,792 --> 00:52:11,589
Oh, fuck.
4,000?

865
00:52:11,694 --> 00:52:13,286
Every day?

866
00:52:13,395 --> 00:52:15,260
I just drop
in the flank steaks.

867
00:52:15,364 --> 00:52:16,729
What's that?

868
00:52:16,832 --> 00:52:19,062
The flank, the flank
side of the steak there.

869
00:52:19,168 --> 00:52:21,363
Actually the other day,
I was being attacked by a hawk...

870
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:23,131
...believe it or not, bizarre.

871
00:52:23,239 --> 00:52:24,501
Yeah, I don't know.

872
00:52:24,607 --> 00:52:27,235
What did you have,
meat on your hands, still?

873
00:52:27,343 --> 00:52:29,208
Uh, no.

874
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:31,643
Oh yeah, it come to a point,
I had to hold a stick up there...

875
00:52:31,747 --> 00:52:34,238
...because it was coming right,
it was coming, it was making...

876
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:36,818
...itjust kept doing it,
it would come right -just make...

877
00:52:36,919 --> 00:52:39,888
...it stop. Unbelievable.

878
00:52:39,989 --> 00:52:41,422
You guys from here?

879
00:52:41,524 --> 00:52:42,548
Yeah.

880
00:52:42,658 --> 00:52:44,990
You guys
having a party tonight or?...

881
00:52:45,094 --> 00:52:47,324
Yeah. The river, man.

882
00:52:47,429 --> 00:52:49,590
We're hitting
the highway now!

883
00:52:51,901 --> 00:52:53,698
So you're not allowed
to jump off the bridge?

884
00:52:53,802 --> 00:52:55,235
No, the cops hate it.

885
00:52:55,337 --> 00:52:56,804
One, two, three.

886
00:52:56,906 --> 00:52:58,464
Eeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaghhhh!

887
00:53:00,643 --> 00:53:02,110
Yeah, the evidence was gone.

888
00:53:02,211 --> 00:53:03,906
From the courts,
nobody could find it.

889
00:53:04,013 --> 00:53:05,446
The cops were just laughing.

890
00:53:05,548 --> 00:53:06,776
Where did it go?

891
00:53:06,882 --> 00:53:07,974
I don't know, the cops
probably smoked...

892
00:53:08,083 --> 00:53:10,347
...lots of cops in this
town smoke the shit.

893
00:53:10,452 --> 00:53:12,886
We're sitting in the
hotel and they're just filming us.

894
00:53:12,988 --> 00:53:15,786
You're gonna buy
these guys some drinks.

895
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:19,893
To high river!

896
00:53:19,995 --> 00:53:21,929
Whooooo!

897
00:53:22,031 --> 00:53:23,362
You're a survivor.

898
00:53:23,465 --> 00:53:24,989
You're gonna make it, boy!

899
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:26,465
You're gonna make it.

900
00:53:26,569 --> 00:53:27,866
Just watch you.

901
00:53:27,970 --> 00:53:30,029
They're not
you're type of guys?

902
00:53:30,139 --> 00:53:33,370
No. Back when I was a teenager
I used to like the long hairs.

903
00:53:33,475 --> 00:53:35,340
Yeah... But now I... Yeah.

904
00:53:35,444 --> 00:53:37,002
One word.

905
00:53:38,714 --> 00:53:40,341
Bangers.

906
00:53:44,353 --> 00:53:47,686
I was born and raised,
I moved out of here...

907
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:49,621
...because it's so fuckin' boring.

908
00:53:49,725 --> 00:53:52,159
You wanna get laid,
you don't wanna be here.

909
00:53:52,261 --> 00:53:56,664
This guy here
will fight me, like this.

910
00:53:56,765 --> 00:53:58,790
I don't want a
barroom fuckin' brawl...

911
00:53:58,901 --> 00:54:00,732
I want a fuckin' true fight here.

912
00:54:02,571 --> 00:54:04,300
I want a true fuckin' match.

913
00:54:04,406 --> 00:54:06,465
I want a fuckin' boxing match.

914
00:54:06,575 --> 00:54:08,600
All right, touch
gloves, let's go.

915
00:54:23,826 --> 00:54:25,760
Fuck me!

916
00:54:32,334 --> 00:54:33,961
'Kay, get that
light over here.

917
00:54:34,069 --> 00:54:35,934
We have to find a
goddamned tooth, sir.

918
00:54:36,038 --> 00:54:38,233
Hey, it's right here.

919
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:41,104
Put some concrete on that.

920
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:44,668
Hey, I got some Crazy glue
in my fuckin' car.

921
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:54,180
Where's that
fuckin' toilet paper at?

922
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:57,282
So, are you guys glad
that we came here instead of...

923
00:54:57,393 --> 00:54:58,792
...stayed camping?

924
00:54:58,894 --> 00:55:02,159
If you'd stop filming
us I might cum here.

925
00:55:02,264 --> 00:55:05,131
I just wanted you
guys to have a good time.

926
00:55:05,234 --> 00:55:09,034
It wasn't necessarily
a good time.

927
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:13,467
Where did Terry go?

928
00:55:16,312 --> 00:55:18,678
Mmm, I could just...

929
00:55:21,884 --> 00:55:24,819
I just wanted
to have a fun weekend.

930
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:26,547
And I did.

931
00:55:26,655 --> 00:55:28,418
And I am.

932
00:55:28,524 --> 00:55:30,389
So it is.

933
00:55:32,328 --> 00:55:35,320
Where'd you guys go?

934
00:55:35,431 --> 00:55:36,989
Deaner.

935
00:55:37,099 --> 00:55:38,828
I got...

936
00:55:38,934 --> 00:55:40,629
I got you something.

937
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:47,500
Where were you, Terry?

938
00:55:47,609 --> 00:55:50,669
Dean. Listen, look.

939
00:55:50,779 --> 00:55:54,772
Dean. Dean. Dean.

940
00:55:54,883 --> 00:55:56,783
Is it okay
if we film this?

941
00:55:56,885 --> 00:55:58,409
We're not gonna...

942
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:01,011
...you can'tjust
film this, I mean.

943
00:56:01,123 --> 00:56:03,114
H- E-e-e-e-e-e-y!

944
00:56:03,225 --> 00:56:07,025
H- E-e-e-e-y!

945
00:56:07,129 --> 00:56:09,461
Terry!

946
00:56:09,565 --> 00:56:13,057
Where did you get
the money for that?

947
00:56:13,168 --> 00:56:15,500
Did everybody do it,
or is itjust...

948
00:56:26,081 --> 00:56:29,710
Guys, what the fuck.
Let's fuckin' get out of here.

949
00:56:29,818 --> 00:56:31,342
Just wait.

950
00:56:31,453 --> 00:56:33,148
Close the door.

951
00:56:33,255 --> 00:56:34,882
Close the door.

952
00:56:37,159 --> 00:56:39,593
It's his fuckin' last
night with his fuckin'...

953
00:56:39,695 --> 00:56:41,754
Imagine you were
losing your nuts.

954
00:56:41,864 --> 00:56:43,525
How would you fuckin' feel?

955
00:56:43,632 --> 00:56:44,599
Right.

956
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:46,531
'Kay, so don't
even ask anymore.

957
00:56:46,635 --> 00:56:48,626
Just let it be what it is.

958
00:57:00,282 --> 00:57:01,806
Asshole.

959
00:57:01,917 --> 00:57:06,047
Are you still
interested in going to your...

960
00:57:06,155 --> 00:57:08,487
...uh, hike place?

961
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:22,468
She was high quality. Fuckin',
the whores in the small towns...

962
00:57:22,571 --> 00:57:26,371
...are the ones to get too,
'cause they're not as fuckin' uppity...

963
00:57:26,475 --> 00:57:28,272
...as them fuckin' city hookers.

964
00:57:28,377 --> 00:57:31,642
No? It's a shame you
never experienced that, I mean.

965
00:57:31,747 --> 00:57:34,215
It's an experience
all unto itself.

966
00:57:34,316 --> 00:57:36,147
Paying for sex?

967
00:57:36,251 --> 00:57:38,014
Well,
I fuckin' paid for it.

968
00:57:40,456 --> 00:57:42,515
What's the
plan for today, guys?

969
00:57:42,624 --> 00:57:44,353
We're going
to Sasquatch Creek.

970
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:46,223
Yeah man,
Sa-a-a-squatch.

971
00:57:46,328 --> 00:57:49,092
We're going to jumping point,
that's gonna be so sweet.

972
00:57:49,198 --> 00:57:51,098
Sort of like that,
but there's water.

973
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,861
And we're not scared.

974
00:57:52,968 --> 00:57:54,993
Yeah, and we don't fall
on our necks and die.

975
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:14,247
We gotta
get down there.

976
00:58:14,356 --> 00:58:16,551
We usually cross
further up, though.

977
00:58:24,666 --> 00:58:28,124
I'd hate to see
you cut yourself again.

978
00:58:28,237 --> 00:58:30,535
How does it look, Terry?

979
00:58:30,639 --> 00:58:33,437
Oh, pretty good.
I'd say it's a bit tight.

980
00:58:40,482 --> 00:58:41,972
Have you
done this before?

981
00:58:42,084 --> 00:58:43,415
Whoooooooooo!

982
00:58:43,519 --> 00:58:45,350
Have you
done this before?

983
00:58:45,454 --> 00:58:46,751
...fuckin' rights.

984
00:58:46,855 --> 00:58:48,220
No.

985
00:58:48,323 --> 00:58:49,881
Fuck you,
you gotta jump in.

986
00:58:49,992 --> 00:58:52,324
Why don't you go first?
You wanna go first?

987
00:58:52,427 --> 00:58:55,055
If you don'tjump we're
gonna say we refuse the rights...

988
00:58:55,163 --> 00:58:58,860
...and properties and responsibilities
for the filming of this film.

989
00:58:58,967 --> 00:59:00,764
Dean!

990
00:59:00,869 --> 00:59:03,804
Just getting warm there.

991
00:59:09,645 --> 00:59:14,275
Aoooh! She's fuckin' cold,
boy, she's cold! Whoo!

992
00:59:21,390 --> 00:59:25,952
That's fuckin' cold,
dude, holy fuck!

993
00:59:26,061 --> 00:59:28,120
Whoooo!

994
00:59:28,230 --> 00:59:30,221
You're up there, Farrel.

995
00:59:32,367 --> 00:59:34,460
You guys wanna jump?

996
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:36,470
I'll jump.

997
00:59:36,572 --> 00:59:37,903
You'll jump?

998
00:59:38,006 --> 00:59:38,938
Sure.

999
00:59:39,041 --> 00:59:40,770
No, no, no, no, no.

1000
00:59:43,111 --> 00:59:44,544
I don't believe this.

1001
00:59:44,646 --> 00:59:46,204
I didn't catch that.

1002
00:59:51,753 --> 00:59:52,947
Is it on?

1003
00:59:53,055 --> 00:59:54,352
It's rolling.

1004
00:59:54,456 --> 00:59:55,616
Okay.

1005
00:59:55,724 --> 00:59:57,589
Just tell me
when to say speed.

1006
00:59:57,693 --> 00:59:58,921
Say speed now.

1007
00:59:59,027 --> 01:00:00,358
Speed.

1008
01:00:03,365 --> 01:00:05,026
Hey Farrel.

1009
01:00:05,133 --> 01:00:07,397
Farrel, you're up, buddy.

1010
01:00:07,502 --> 01:00:09,595
Farrel, what the fuck?

1011
01:00:09,705 --> 01:00:15,200
Everyone fuckin' - All four of us,
all four of us did it.

1012
01:00:15,310 --> 01:00:17,403
Is this your movie?

1013
01:00:17,512 --> 01:00:19,742
Whooo! Done. Over.

1014
01:00:19,848 --> 01:00:22,112
You don't go home thinking,
I'm a fuckin' pansy.

1015
01:00:22,217 --> 01:00:23,980
The four of us, right...

1016
01:00:24,086 --> 01:00:26,179
Just -
Farrel, get in there.

1017
01:00:26,288 --> 01:00:29,883
Whooo!
Let's fuckin' do it!

1018
01:00:35,964 --> 01:00:37,625
Farrel, what
the fuck you doing?

1019
01:00:37,733 --> 01:00:39,132
I wanna go home.

1020
01:00:39,234 --> 01:00:43,034
Farrel! Farrel! Farrel! Farrel!

1021
01:00:45,374 --> 01:00:49,105
Don't think about it.
Justjump in and go!

1022
01:00:49,211 --> 01:00:50,735
Come on, Farrel!

1023
01:00:56,051 --> 01:00:57,450
Nice on, buddy.

1024
01:00:59,054 --> 01:01:01,955
Farrel! Farrel!

1025
01:01:02,057 --> 01:01:03,786
Aw, fuck!

1026
01:01:37,726 --> 01:01:41,218
I mean obviously
he didn't have that...

1027
01:01:41,329 --> 01:01:43,388
...if he's diving headfirst
into the river.

1028
01:01:43,498 --> 01:01:45,932
Yeah, I don't think
that ever really hit him...

1029
01:01:46,034 --> 01:01:48,867
...overseas.

1030
01:01:48,970 --> 01:01:52,133
Just one thing after
another, our whole life...

1031
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:53,332
...growing up.

1032
01:01:53,442 --> 01:01:54,670
Yeah.

1033
01:01:54,776 --> 01:01:56,801
He always had to be,
like, in the centre of it.

1034
01:01:56,912 --> 01:01:59,472
"Oh, it's all about me, look
at me jump, look at me. "

1035
01:02:04,019 --> 01:02:05,145
Hi.

1036
01:02:05,253 --> 01:02:06,277
Hi.

1037
01:02:06,388 --> 01:02:07,787
Hi.

1038
01:02:07,889 --> 01:02:11,620
This is uh, this is...

1039
01:02:11,727 --> 01:02:13,888
Oh, hi...

1040
01:02:15,897 --> 01:02:17,194
Sorry.

1041
01:02:17,299 --> 01:02:18,732
That's Trixie.

1042
01:02:18,834 --> 01:02:21,098
She can come in?
Come on in, Trixie.

1043
01:02:21,203 --> 01:02:23,262
She's
fussy, I'm sorry.

1044
01:02:23,371 --> 01:02:26,306
Sorry about...
about Farrel.

1045
01:02:26,408 --> 01:02:29,741
If there's anything
you need, like, uh...

1046
01:02:29,845 --> 01:02:32,678
...we ain't working right now,
so...

1047
01:02:32,781 --> 01:02:35,978
We could come by and help
out. Mow the lawn or something.

1048
01:02:39,421 --> 01:02:40,854
It's on tape.

1049
01:02:40,956 --> 01:02:43,015
You know, it's on
the, you could see it.

1050
01:02:43,125 --> 01:02:46,185
We do that, like, I probably
jumped it, like 60 times.

1051
01:02:46,294 --> 01:02:48,694
At least, we always,
that was the place we always...

1052
01:02:48,797 --> 01:02:50,958
...went to and justjumped
in the water and...

1053
01:02:51,066 --> 01:02:53,432
It was really hot.

1054
01:02:53,535 --> 01:02:55,560
You guys remember
how hot it was?

1055
01:02:55,670 --> 01:02:57,069
It was hot.

1056
01:02:57,172 --> 01:03:00,164
I'm getting better
already, I feel better.

1057
01:03:00,275 --> 01:03:04,905
It's, kind of have to,
you know, would thank Farrel...

1058
01:03:05,013 --> 01:03:08,881
'cause he brung it up to Trixie
there and then Trixie kind of...

1059
01:03:08,984 --> 01:03:13,011
...forced me to go get her dealt
with and I'll, you know...

1060
01:03:13,121 --> 01:03:15,282
...it was the right thing to do.

1061
01:03:19,327 --> 01:03:22,160
It hurts like a bitch, like...

1062
01:03:22,264 --> 01:03:25,290
Thank you,
thank you both for coming.

1063
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,334
Thank you.

1064
01:03:29,738 --> 01:03:32,298
Come and see the cake,
Joan, I want you to see...

1065
01:03:32,407 --> 01:03:34,375
...you know Farrel and filming.

1066
01:03:34,476 --> 01:03:36,569
Oh, oh my God.

1067
01:03:36,678 --> 01:03:38,441
Isn't that
just wonderful?

1068
01:03:38,547 --> 01:03:41,345
Isn't thatjust a
beautiful cake, isn't it?

1069
01:03:41,449 --> 01:03:43,917
Do you wanna
like to hear a joke, Mrs. Mitchner?

1070
01:03:44,019 --> 01:03:46,146
Most...
certainly, yes.

1071
01:03:46,254 --> 01:03:48,415
I think Farrel
really liked this one.

1072
01:03:48,523 --> 01:03:50,081
Did he?

1073
01:03:50,192 --> 01:03:53,423
What do you call
a man who's from Pakistan who's been...

1074
01:03:53,528 --> 01:03:56,759
...everywhere and
seen everything?

1075
01:03:56,865 --> 01:04:00,392
No, been everywhere and
done everything, yeah?

1076
01:04:00,502 --> 01:04:02,663
I don't know.

1077
01:04:02,771 --> 01:04:04,932
Bindair Dundat.

1078
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:10,103
Oh,
been there, done that.

1079
01:04:10,212 --> 01:04:11,645
Yeah.

1080
01:04:11,746 --> 01:04:15,045
Is that his first
and his last name?

1081
01:04:15,150 --> 01:04:16,481
Yeah.

1082
01:04:16,585 --> 01:04:18,109
Been there, done that.

1083
01:04:18,220 --> 01:04:19,881
No, Bindair.

1084
01:04:19,988 --> 01:04:22,183
Been dere, oh!

1085
01:04:27,362 --> 01:04:29,227
She liked that one.

1086
01:04:29,331 --> 01:04:30,662
She's laughing.

1087
01:04:30,765 --> 01:04:32,164
I told you.

1088
01:04:32,267 --> 01:04:34,497
Oh! Did it take my son
that long to get it?

1089
01:04:34,603 --> 01:04:35,968
No.

1090
01:04:36,071 --> 01:04:37,663
Well, thank you, boys.

1091
01:04:37,772 --> 01:04:40,172
Thank you very much for
thatjoke. We needed that.

1092
01:04:40,275 --> 01:04:41,572
Yeah.

1093
01:04:43,078 --> 01:04:46,536
Oh hey,
yeah good, hey man.

1094
01:04:46,681 --> 01:04:51,516
I thought for sure it was, you
know, over, after, after...

1095
01:04:51,620 --> 01:04:57,081
...you know... I keep thinking about
it over and over, like, I recall...

1096
01:04:57,192 --> 01:05:00,389
...that day so clear, it's
like slow-mo sometimes.

1097
01:05:03,331 --> 01:05:06,528
For awhile there we sort of
stopped talking to each other.

1098
01:05:06,635 --> 01:05:09,399
It wasn't even about Farrel or
nothing, it was just us sort...

1099
01:05:09,504 --> 01:05:12,530
...of yelling, but I think deep
down that's what it was about...

1100
01:05:12,641 --> 01:05:15,667
...he's been going to the hospital
quite a bit, and he's just...

1101
01:05:15,777 --> 01:05:19,304
...getting some tests done, and
uh, apparently he's got one...

1102
01:05:19,414 --> 01:05:22,906
...more big test, and once they
give him that clear, it's looking...

1103
01:05:23,018 --> 01:05:26,146
...good, but we don't know
yet, so otherwise he might have...

1104
01:05:26,254 --> 01:05:28,620
...to keep getting
treated, you know.

1105
01:05:28,723 --> 01:05:33,160
The chemo was sort of
like a downhill battle, 'cause...

1106
01:05:33,261 --> 01:05:36,196
I wasn't doing nothing, I was
just getting sicker and sicker...

1107
01:05:36,298 --> 01:05:40,257
...and like, no energy and all
that stupid shit, but now...

1108
01:05:40,368 --> 01:05:43,030
I'm slowly building up.

1109
01:05:43,138 --> 01:05:45,538
Fuck, I don't
know, we'll see.

1110
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:48,768
He doesn't look
too happy today.

1111
01:05:48,877 --> 01:05:50,845
Hey Deaner.

1112
01:05:52,948 --> 01:05:54,609
Easy, easy.

1113
01:05:54,716 --> 01:05:58,117
Whoa, easy there, Terry.

1114
01:05:58,219 --> 01:06:02,212
Imagine you had a truck
up on the hoist, and you're...

1115
01:06:02,324 --> 01:06:05,452
...fixing it, and you're fixing,
you're replacing the brake...

1116
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:08,859
...lines, but the whole time
you're worried one day the...

1117
01:06:08,964 --> 01:06:11,956
...brake line might break,
like that's just kind of dumb.

1118
01:06:12,067 --> 01:06:14,092
Yeah, yeah,
you just fixed it.

1119
01:06:14,202 --> 01:06:15,863
Yeah, but
you're working on it.

1120
01:06:15,971 --> 01:06:18,531
So you've, it's like, maybe
if you knew the brake lines...

1121
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:21,108
...were fucked, and you kept
driving, then you could go oh shit.

1122
01:06:21,209 --> 01:06:22,733
Yeah.

1123
01:06:22,844 --> 01:06:25,210
You're getting your
brake lines put it right now.

1124
01:06:25,313 --> 01:06:28,771
Oh, he's been doing good, you
know, he's a tough guy right...

1125
01:06:28,883 --> 01:06:32,114
...down there from the head to
the heart, and uh, he's been...

1126
01:06:32,220 --> 01:06:36,247
...helping me out real good. Like
I say, Terry's my best buddy.

1127
01:06:41,129 --> 01:06:44,724
Him joking around keeps me
joking around too, you know.

1128
01:06:44,833 --> 01:06:47,165
Like some nights, I'll just
be like, fuck, Terry, I wanna...

1129
01:06:47,268 --> 01:06:50,431
...sleep, and he'll just be
like, c'mon fuckin' baldy.

1130
01:06:50,538 --> 01:06:52,733
Do you have any
with booze in them?

1131
01:06:52,841 --> 01:06:54,274
Will that be all?

1132
01:06:54,376 --> 01:06:55,866
Yeah, that's everything.

1133
01:06:55,977 --> 01:06:57,376
All together?

1134
01:06:57,479 --> 01:06:58,707
Yeah.

1135
01:07:05,387 --> 01:07:09,414
But Terry, he just
treats me like old Deaner...

1136
01:07:09,524 --> 01:07:13,984
...you know? Basically what I want
to do is just get back, on the...

1137
01:07:14,095 --> 01:07:18,862
...in the saddle, so to speak,
startjamming again. You tell...

1138
01:07:18,967 --> 01:07:22,630
...me right now that the results
are bad, I go, okay, fuck...

1139
01:07:22,737 --> 01:07:25,604
...wheel me into the fuckin'
ward there, I'll giv'er again...

1140
01:07:25,707 --> 01:07:29,006
'cause I ain't gonna let it you
know, kill me, capture me...

1141
01:07:29,110 --> 01:07:32,637
...take me down now, eh. Before
I was kind of stupid, I was like...

1142
01:07:32,747 --> 01:07:35,409
...fuck, I don't care, but now
I kind of care, like I don't...

1143
01:07:35,517 --> 01:07:39,283
I'm not gonna let no cancer
take me down. There's no way.

1144
01:07:46,628 --> 01:07:50,359
Thank you all for, uh,
coming today to celebrate, uh...

1145
01:07:50,432 --> 01:07:53,833
...life and friends and family.

1146
01:07:53,935 --> 01:07:57,029
Tomorrow we're gonna have some
big news of what's gonna be...

1147
01:07:57,138 --> 01:08:02,838
...happening with Dean.
And um, his tasks in life are done...

1148
01:08:02,944 --> 01:08:06,471
...and we'll see what's going to
happen tomorrow, but he's been...

1149
01:08:06,581 --> 01:08:09,311
...a wonderful son and a
treasure and a treat...

1150
01:08:09,417 --> 01:08:11,351
...and I love you very much.

1151
01:08:19,828 --> 01:08:23,457
Anyway, praise
the Lord and let's eat!

1152
01:08:23,565 --> 01:08:25,590
Count our blessings!

1153
01:08:30,371 --> 01:08:34,501
The chemotherapy does
knock him down a little bit...

1154
01:08:34,609 --> 01:08:38,306
...but he's coping it, with a
pretty good sense of humor...

1155
01:08:38,413 --> 01:08:40,244
...and that's the bottom line.

1156
01:08:40,348 --> 01:08:43,249
Fuck, they took out,
along with my nut they took out...

1157
01:08:43,351 --> 01:08:44,909
...my urethra.

1158
01:08:45,019 --> 01:08:46,748
I don't know if they
actually did it.

1159
01:08:46,855 --> 01:08:48,516
That's gotta be a record.

1160
01:08:48,623 --> 01:08:51,023
I was under a lot of
anaesthetic when they said...

1161
01:08:51,126 --> 01:08:52,889
...what else do you want done?

1162
01:08:52,994 --> 01:08:55,394
You're so full of shit.

1163
01:08:55,497 --> 01:08:58,591
Well Dean's, uh,
Dean's a trooper. He came into...

1164
01:08:58,700 --> 01:09:02,101
...this pretty sort of fixated
on his, on what he was losing.

1165
01:09:02,203 --> 01:09:05,036
I guess is, under the
circumstances you can understand...

1166
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:07,904
...that. First of all, it's -
it's one of two organs and...

1167
01:09:08,009 --> 01:09:11,945
...you actually don't need
both of them to function.

1168
01:09:12,046 --> 01:09:15,038
And what's function is to be
fertile. So, he's still...

1169
01:09:15,150 --> 01:09:18,347
...producing sperm, so if - He can
have children. It doesn't affect...

1170
01:09:18,453 --> 01:09:22,617
...his sexual performance,
so he's realized all these plusses...

1171
01:09:22,724 --> 01:09:25,591
...and he's turned around
and he's feeling great.

1172
01:09:25,693 --> 01:09:29,129
The last time I was
there, he said next time we see...

1173
01:09:29,230 --> 01:09:33,291
...you we'll have some positive
results. Certain results...

1174
01:09:33,401 --> 01:09:36,996
I guess, would be a better -
the better description.

1175
01:09:37,105 --> 01:09:39,630
He said he was gonna
come, you know.

1176
01:09:39,741 --> 01:09:43,973
Maybe he worked late on a
Saturday, maybe he worked...

1177
01:09:44,078 --> 01:09:47,275
...through the softball
game too, you know.

1178
01:09:47,382 --> 01:09:49,441
There he is.

1179
01:09:53,855 --> 01:09:55,516
Hey.

1180
01:09:57,926 --> 01:10:00,224
Hey, you look like
one of the three stooges.

1181
01:10:00,328 --> 01:10:03,126
Yeah, you look
like the other two.

1182
01:10:07,302 --> 01:10:09,896
I think you're
gonna make it.

1183
01:10:11,039 --> 01:10:13,633
Hey everybody,
it's fuckin' Tron!

1184
01:10:13,741 --> 01:10:15,800
Whooooo!

1185
01:10:15,910 --> 01:10:18,174
Tron! Yeah!

1186
01:10:18,279 --> 01:10:22,841
Let's get her going!

1187
01:10:22,951 --> 01:10:27,752
Straight off, there's
no pretty picture here.

1188
01:10:27,855 --> 01:10:31,018
This is the most aggressive
tumor he could have had...

1189
01:10:31,125 --> 01:10:33,855
...so the outlook is actually bad.

1190
01:10:33,962 --> 01:10:37,090
I phoned the hospital
arranged to, uh, give him...

1191
01:10:37,198 --> 01:10:44,161
...my extra one, but, they said,
that, uh, the scrotum...

1192
01:10:44,272 --> 01:10:49,403
...of an average man couldn't
handle such a big one, so.

1193
01:10:49,510 --> 01:10:54,038
There's still only
a 40% chance that he will be...

1194
01:10:54,148 --> 01:10:57,709
...disease-free at the end
of this treatment process.

1195
01:10:57,819 --> 01:11:01,983
You know what? Either
way, regardless of what tomorrow...

1196
01:11:02,090 --> 01:11:07,460
...says to me, whether the doctor
says pain or the forecast says...

1197
01:11:07,562 --> 01:11:11,521
...rain. I don't fuckin' care.
Deaner's gonna keep on givin'er.

1198
01:11:11,633 --> 01:11:13,794
And that's all there is to it.

1199
01:11:13,901 --> 01:11:16,131
You guys, right from
the horse's mouth, eh?

1200
01:11:16,237 --> 01:11:18,205
I'm gonna keep on givin'er.

1201
01:11:18,306 --> 01:11:23,573
And if it takes another couple
months or a couple of years...

1202
01:11:23,678 --> 01:11:27,239
...we'll be right back
here next year.

1203
01:11:58,346 --> 01:12:04,910
One news can nudge your head
long into, you know, down, and...

1204
01:12:05,019 --> 01:12:09,388
...the other news can sort of flip
you around and push you back.

1205
01:12:16,597 --> 01:12:20,533
I feel like I'm
going fuckin' mental here...

1206
01:12:20,635 --> 01:12:23,160
...that's how I feel,
like waiting.

1207
01:12:47,395 --> 01:12:49,056
Hi Dean.

1208
01:12:49,163 --> 01:12:51,154
Oh, hey Dr. Lim.

1209
01:12:51,265 --> 01:12:54,029
I just want you to
understand perfectly that uh...

1210
01:12:54,135 --> 01:12:57,935
...the results show that
there's absolutely no spread, okay?

1211
01:12:58,039 --> 01:12:59,700
So that's good, right?

1212
01:12:59,807 --> 01:13:01,172
That's very good.

1213
01:13:01,275 --> 01:13:02,674
Aw, right on!

1214
01:13:02,777 --> 01:13:05,644
If there was spread,
the prognosis is much worse.

1215
01:13:05,747 --> 01:13:10,741
I don't want to pull - Make
unnecessarily, uh, better than...

1216
01:13:10,852 --> 01:13:14,049
...what it is. It's still a
serious disease, okay?

1217
01:13:14,155 --> 01:13:19,855
With no spread, with
chemotherapy, with radiation...

1218
01:13:19,994 --> 01:13:26,490
...therapy, there is still an outside
chance many years from now, okay?

1219
01:13:26,601 --> 01:13:27,795
Okay.

1220
01:13:27,902 --> 01:13:30,462
But as far as follow-up
goes, you, you'll have...

1221
01:13:30,571 --> 01:13:33,699
...the scheduled six-monthly
and yearly visits.

1222
01:13:33,808 --> 01:13:36,299
You tell me when to
come down here, doc...

1223
01:13:36,411 --> 01:13:38,436
...and I'll fuckin' be here, so.

1224
01:13:38,546 --> 01:13:39,979
Sure, great.

1225
01:13:40,081 --> 01:13:41,605
Excellent.

1226
01:13:41,716 --> 01:13:44,583
'Cause I really don't know why
he didn't lose his moustache...

1227
01:13:44,685 --> 01:13:49,179
...hair. Kind mind-boggling, I
guess. Kind of medical miracle...

1228
01:13:49,290 --> 01:13:51,815
...but I don't have a good
explanation for why.

1229
01:13:51,926 --> 01:13:54,121
Oh, hey Dean,
how's it going?

1230
01:13:54,228 --> 01:13:55,820
It's going.

1231
01:13:55,930 --> 01:13:57,693
What'd he say?

1232
01:13:57,799 --> 01:14:01,326
Can I have a smoke?

1233
01:14:01,436 --> 01:14:04,132
Give me a smoke,
man, seriously.

1234
01:14:04,238 --> 01:14:06,729
Dean, you're not
supposed to smoke.

1235
01:14:06,841 --> 01:14:08,638
He said it might
make you sicker.

1236
01:14:08,743 --> 01:14:11,109
Yeah, doesn't seem
to matter no more.

1237
01:14:11,212 --> 01:14:13,112
What are you talking about?

1238
01:14:13,214 --> 01:14:20,677
Well I don't really seem
to have a lot of, a lot time left.

1239
01:14:20,788 --> 01:14:22,085
Really?

1240
01:14:22,190 --> 01:14:24,420
Yeah.

1241
01:14:24,525 --> 01:14:27,653
He said you're go
- Gonna die?

1242
01:14:27,762 --> 01:14:30,424
Could we go out for
lunch or something?

1243
01:14:30,531 --> 01:14:31,759
Yeah?...

1244
01:14:31,866 --> 01:14:33,390
Like right now?

1245
01:14:33,501 --> 01:14:34,991
When are you...

1246
01:14:35,102 --> 01:14:37,900
Like, I might not,
I, I don't have...

1247
01:14:38,005 --> 01:14:39,734
He said you
were gonna die?

1248
01:14:39,841 --> 01:14:41,968
Yeah, I don't really
have a lot of time.

1249
01:14:42,109 --> 01:14:44,236
So we should go
for lunch right now.

1250
01:14:44,345 --> 01:14:46,745
Are you - Are you
all right? Are you all right?

1251
01:14:48,382 --> 01:14:50,111
Dean.

1252
01:14:52,487 --> 01:14:53,681
Actually, Terry.

1253
01:14:53,788 --> 01:14:54,880
Yes, what?

1254
01:14:54,989 --> 01:14:57,150
We might not even
be able to make it through lunch...

1255
01:14:57,258 --> 01:14:58,748
...unless we go
somewhere close.

1256
01:14:58,860 --> 01:15:00,691
Sure, let's go,
you wanna have lunch?

1257
01:15:00,795 --> 01:15:02,285
Sure, I'll buy you lunch.

1258
01:15:02,396 --> 01:15:05,229
I might only
12 or 13 minutes left.

1259
01:15:05,333 --> 01:15:06,766
Fuck you!

1260
01:15:08,402 --> 01:15:10,632
Terry! I'm calling!

1261
01:15:10,738 --> 01:15:12,365
What a jackass.

1262
01:15:12,473 --> 01:15:14,498
What a f...
you're an asshole.

1263
01:15:14,609 --> 01:15:16,201
Terry, don't leave me!

1264
01:15:16,310 --> 01:15:17,902
Don't leave me.

1265
01:15:21,015 --> 01:15:23,483
If you tell anyone
I fuckin' hugged you...

1266
01:15:23,584 --> 01:15:27,418
I won't tell them you hugged me.
I'll tell them you fuckin' tried...

1267
01:15:27,522 --> 01:15:29,820
...to stick your tongue
down my throat.

1268
01:15:59,186 --> 01:16:00,778
To Farrel.

1269
01:16:00,888 --> 01:16:02,822
To Farrel.
