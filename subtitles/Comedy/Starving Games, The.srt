1
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,800
Replacement team's here, sir.

2
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Right.

3
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,200
Come on through.

4
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,300
20 minutes and we were gonna
start looking for you.

5
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,900
Yeah. It's really something out there.

6
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,200
- You look a mess, sir.
- Yeah?

7
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,300
Your turn next, Ginsburg.

8
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,100
OK. I'll see you in 24.

9
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,000
See you tomorrow.

10
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,700
What was that you were you saying?

11
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:53,400
You used to hear her chant
all night long. Om mahneypod me om.

12
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,100
- Om mahneypod me om.
- Over the plants?

13
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,400
She'd cup her hands over those seeds
and chant by the hour.

14
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,600
She grew the most beautiful
wandoos you ever saw, man.

15
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,900
Primo stuff. Resin city.

16
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Stand clear.

17
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,900
The commander's been worried
about you. The roads must be a bear.

18
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,200
- What roads?
- Visibility.

19
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:31,000
Visibility? Bullshit. You guys haven't
been on time for the last six months.

20
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,800
- I wrote you guys up in the logbook.
- Yeah. You're a prince, Bevan.

21
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,800
Good night, gentlemen!

22
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,700
So, that was like sinsemilia, right?

23
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,500
Sinsemilla. This grass made
Thai stick taste like oregano.

24
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,700
Lay you out flat, man.

25
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,000
- Got a red light, sir.
- What on?

26
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,200
Number eight. Warhead alarm.

27
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,500
Give it a thump with your finger.

28
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,200
Alarm reset.

29
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,700
Skybird, this is Dropkick with
a Red dash Alpha message in two parts.

30
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,000
Break. Break. Red dash Alpha.

31
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,700
- Stand by to copy message.
- Standing by.

32
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,100
Romeo OscarNovember Charlie

33
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,800
Tango Tango Lima Alpha.

34
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:52,100
Authentication: 220040 Delta

35
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,000
Lima.

36
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,100
I have a valid message.
Stand by to authenticate.

37
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,800
I agree with authentication also, sir.

38
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,200
- Enter launch code.
- Entering launch code.

39
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,700
- Launch order confirmed.
- Holy shit!

40
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,000
Target selection: complete.
Time on target sequence: complete.

41
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,600
- Yield selection: complete.
- Begin countdown. Tminus 60.

42
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,800
- All right. Let's do it. Insert launch key.
- Stand by.

43
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,500
- Launch key inserted.
- Roger.

44
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,900
On my mark... rotate launch key to Set.

45
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,500
Three... two... one...

46
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,700
- Mark.
- Tminus 50.

47
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,900
Roger. At Set.

48
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,800
- Sir?
- Tminus 40.

49
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,300
- Enable missiles.
- Number one enabled. Two enabled.

50
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,800
- Three enabled.
- Get somebody on the goddamn phone.

51
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,100
Seven... eight...

52
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,200
Nine...

53
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,600
Ten. All missiles enabled.

54
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,800
- Get me Wing Command Post. Direct line.
- That's not the correct procedure.

55
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,300
- Try SAC Headquarters on the HF.
- That's not the procedure.

56
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:50,800
I want somebody on the goddamn phone
before I kill 20 million people.

57
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,300
T minus 20.

58
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,300
I got nothin' here! They might
have been knocked out already.

59
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,000
Right.

60
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,300
On my mark,
rotate launch keys to Launch.

61
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,700
Roger. Ready to go to Launch.

62
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,100
- Fourteen...
- Thirteen... twelve...

63
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,600
Eleven...

64
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,100
Seven... six...

65
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,500
- Five...
- Sir, we have a launch order.

66
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,900
- Three... two...
- Put your hand on the key, sir.

67
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,900
One... Launch!

68
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:33,000
- Sir, we are at launch! Turn your key!
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

69
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,800
Turn your key, sir!

70
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,400
They're cleared. Go ahead and open it up.

71
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:35,300
- Hello. I'm Pat Healy.
- I'm Lyle Watson. This is Arthur Cabot.

72
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:40,100
I'm Pat Healy, Dr McKittrick's assistant.
I've got some passes for you here.

73
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,200
We had scheduled a meeting
pending your arrival.

74
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,000
If you have any questions,
feel free to ask me.

75
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,200
I'd be happy to fill you in
if there's any way I can.

76
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,000
They're here.

77
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,700
Good.

78
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,300
Let's go.

79
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,500
Cabot and Watson came alone.
No senators. No congressmen.

80
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:58,900
I wish they'd brought a few senators.
I'd like to tell 'em what's going on here.

81
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,800
John, please! Don't start that right away.

82
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,500
I had them on the phone
and they're calmed down.

83
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,800
Well, are we positive that these men had
no way of knowing this was only a test?

84
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,600
Lyle, for God's sakes! How many times
are we gonna go through this?

85
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,200
- It doesn't make any difference.
- I've spoken to these men.

86
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,700
They all believed it was the real deal.

87
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,500
Look, we gotta be on a plane
in less than an hour.

88
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:28,900
I have to explain to the president
why 22% of his missile commanders

89
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,600
failed to launch their missiles. What
am I supposed to say? 22% isn't so bad?

90
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,500
The president knows that I am fully
responsible for the men in my command.

91
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,600
I've ordered a re-evaluation of
our psychological screening procedure.

92
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,200
Wait a minute. Excuse me, General.

93
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,300
We can't ask these men
to go back to the president

94
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,700
with a lot of headshrinker horseshit!
You can't screen out human response!

95
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,600
Those men know what it means to turn
the keys, and some are just not up to it!

96
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,500
Now, it's as simple as that!

97
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,000
I think we oughta take
the men out of the loop.

98
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,600
- Mr McKittrick, you're out of line, sir.
- Why am I out of line?

99
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,300
Excuse me!

100
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,100
I'm sorry. I don't understand.
Take them out of the loop?

101
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,000
Gentlemen! We've had men in these silos

102
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,600
since before any of you
were watching Howdy Doody.

103
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,600
For myself, I sleep pretty well at night
knowing those boys are down there.

104
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,900
General, we know they're fine men,
but in a nuclear war we can't afford

105
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,800
to have missiles
lying dormant in those silos

106
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,800
because those men refuse to turn
the keys when the computers tell 'em to!

107
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,200
You mean when
the president orders them to.

108
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,900
The president will probably follow
the computer war plan. That's a fact!

109
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,900
I imagine the Joint Chiefs
will have some input.

110
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,600
- You're damn tootin'.
- Well, hell...

111
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,200
In a surprise attack, there's no time.

112
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,000
23 minutes from warning to impact.

113
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,200
- Six minutes if it's sub-launched.
- Six minutes.

114
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,100
That's barely enough time
for the president to make a decision.

115
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,300
Once he makes the decision,
the computer should take over.

116
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,100
Now, sir, I know that you've got
a plane waiting for you,

117
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,700
but if you could indulge me,
I'd like to show you something.

118
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,600
These computers give instant access
to the state of the world.

119
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,100
Troop movements, Soviet
missile tests, weather patterns.

120
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:36,100
It all flows into this room,
and then into the WOPR computer.

121
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,700
- WOPR? What is that?
- War Operation Plan Response.

122
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,800
This is Mr Richter.

123
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,700
Paul, would you like to tell
these gentlemen about the WOPR?

124
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:50,300
Well, the WOPR spends all its time
thinking about World War Ill.

125
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:57,500
24 hours a day, 365 days a year,
it plays an endless series of war games

126
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,400
using all available information
on the state of the world.

127
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:05,400
The WOPR has already fought
World War Ill, as a game,

128
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,600
time and time again.

129
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,900
It estimates Soviet responses
to our responses

130
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,400
to their responses, and so on.

131
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,100
Estimates damage. Counts the dead.

132
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,000
Then it looks for ways
to improve its score...

133
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,600
The point is that the key decisions

134
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,800
of every option have already
been made by the WOPR.

135
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,500
So all this trillion-dollar hardware
is really at the mercy

136
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,100
of those men with the little brass keys?

137
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,900
That's exactly right. Whose only problem
is that they're human beings.

138
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:39,900
But in 30 days we could put in electronic
relays. Get the men out of the loop.

139
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,700
Gentlemen...

140
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,400
I wouldn't trust this overgrown pile of
microchips further than I could throw it.

141
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:53,100
I don't know if you wanna trust the safety
of our country to some... silicon diode...

142
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,900
Nobody is talking about entrusting
the safety of the nation

143
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,200
to a machine, for God's sake!

144
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,200
We'll keep control,
but here at the top where it belongs.

145
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,900
All right, gentlemen.

146
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I think I'm going to recommend
McKittrick's idea to the president.

147
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,700
And I'll get back to you on this.

148
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,600
You won't regret this.

149
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,000
OK. You had fries and a Coke, right?

150
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,600
Damn!

151
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,100
- Hi, David!
- Hi, Howie!

152
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,300
- How's it going?
- Pretty good.

153
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,600
- You wanna take this over? I gotta go.
- Sure!

154
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,800
- Go ahead.
- Thanks!

155
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,500
- Bye, David!
- Bye!

156
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,900
All right. Question number two.

157
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:42,800
Seeds that are germinated in water
before they are planted will... what?

158
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,500
- Robert?
- Sprout roots?

159
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,300
Ah! David!

160
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,800
Nice of you to join us.
Oh, David. I have a little present for you.

161
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,000
Question number four.
In the history of science,

162
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,600
novel and innovative concepts
occasionally arise

163
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,400
from sudden left-field inspiration.

164
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,300
Miss Mack...

165
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,700
Could you tell us your answer
to question number four?

166
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,300
Why do nitrogen nodules
cling to the roots of plants?

167
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,100
Love?

168
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:33,600
Jennifer, what do you know about
nitrogen nodules that we don't?

169
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:37,300
Some bit of salacious info
to which you alone are privy?

170
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,000
- No.
- I see.

171
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,300
No, you didn't know
the correct answer - symbiosis.

172
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,800
Because you don't pay attention in class.

173
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,600
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

174
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:58,800
There seems to be a lot of confusion on
this next question - asexual reproduction.

175
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,300
Could someone tell me, please

176
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:07,700
who first suggested the idea
of reproduction without sex?

177
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,700
- Miss Mack!
- Yes?

178
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,400
What is so amusing?

179
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,900
What?

180
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,700
All right, Lightman.

181
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:32,900
Maybe you can tell us who first suggested
the idea of reproduction without sex.

182
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,500
Your wife?

183
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,000
Get out, Lightman! Get out!

184
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,100
Mr Ligget wants me to discuss
my attitude problem with Mr Kessler.

185
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,600
I think Mr Kessler's getting tired
of your attitude problem.

186
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,400
Me, too.

187
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,600
Lightman. What a... surprise.

188
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,800
Won't you come in?

189
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,800
Hi!

190
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,100
Hi!

191
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,100
Sorry if I got you in trouble.
I couldn't stop laughing.

192
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,400
That's OK. You were perfect.

193
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,600
- I was?
- Yeah.

194
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,600
- You want a ride home?
- Yeah.

195
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,800
Hop on.

196
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,300
- So you got an F on that test today, too?
- Yep.

197
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,200
Guess we're both gonna be
stuck in summer school.

198
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,300
- Not me.
- Why not? You have to make up biology.

199
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,400
- I don't think so.
- Why not?

200
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:32,100
- Why not? Come on! Tell me. Why not?
- Make a left.

201
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:35,300
Why don't you come up to my house
and I'll show you?

202
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,500
What are you gonna show me?

203
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:40,800
I'm gonna show you.
I'll show you how you do it.

204
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,900
- Hi, Bo!
- Oh! Hi, Bo!

205
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,100
Hey, Bo! How you doin'?

206
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,700
My room's upstairs.

207
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,900
- Your parents aren't home?
- No. They both work.

208
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,200
A little mess.

209
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,400
It's OK. You should see my room.

210
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,800
- You're really into computers, huh?
- Yeah.

211
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:53,500
- What are you doing?
- I'm dialling into the school's computer.

212
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:10,400
They change the password every couple
of weeks, but I know where they write it.

213
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,200
- Are those your grades?!
- Yeah.

214
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,600
I don't think that I deserved an F, do you?

215
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:36,200
- You can't do that!
- Already done.

216
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,800
- Do you have a middle initial?
- K. Katherine.

217
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,800
Those are my grades.

218
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,700
- How can anybody get a D in home ec?
- That's none of your business.

219
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,300
- Can you erase this?
- No. It's too late.

220
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,300
What are you doing?

221
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:02,300
- I'm changing your biology grade.
- No. You'll get me in trouble.

222
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,400
Nobody can find out. You got a C!
Now you won't go to summer school.

223
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,600
- Change it back.
- Why? They can't...

224
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,900
- I said change it back.
- OK. OK.

225
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,100
I guess I'd better get going.

226
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,700
Thanks for the ride.

227
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,600
Yeah. OK. Bye.

228
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,800
Bye.

229
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:34,500
Get down. Get down. You've already
had your dinner. Now just sit.

230
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,700
Sit! Stay!

231
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,600
- Don't forget to take out the garbage.
- David.

232
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,600
- Put that lid on real tight.
- I know, Ma.

233
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,000
Yes, they will carry back on the second.

234
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,800
Sure. I think we can really work out
some creative financing.

235
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,700
Oh, but you've gotta see it!

236
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,600
There's a Jacuzzi
in the master bedroom...

237
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,400
Oh, sure. We can work that out.

238
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:17,500
That is true. You'll have a balloon
payment at the end of five years.

239
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,100
But that's nothing.
The economy is gonna be great then.

240
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,300
He who dances must pay the piper.

241
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:27,200
- See you, Dad.
- I'll meet you tomorrow at 9.30. Bye.

242
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,300
You know, I worry about that kid.

243
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,500
Why?

244
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,900
Sometimes I think
we're all gonna get electrocuted.

245
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,200
This corn is raw!

246
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,900
I know. Isn't it wonderful? It's so crisp.

247
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,900
- Of course it's crisp! It's raw!
- It's terrific!

248
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,200
You can just taste the vitamin
A and D in here. It's great.

249
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Couldn't we have pills,
and cook the corn?

250
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:01,400
- What city, please?
- For Sunnyvale, California.

251
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,600
The number for Protovision.

252
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,900
Yes. That's 555 8632.

253
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:12,000
Thank you. Could you also tell me
what other prefixes cover that area?

254
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:17,500
There's 399, 437, 767, 936.

255
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,300
Thanks.

256
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,100
Protovision... I have you now.

257
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,800
Yes?

258
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,400
Saul's Fish Market.

259
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,600
- Hi!
- Oh, hi!

260
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,300
What?

261
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:30,300
I've been thinking.
That thing with my grade.

262
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:33,100
- Can you still change it?
- Oh, I don't know...

263
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:37,000
I can't believe I was so stupid.
I should've just let you do it.

264
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,200
- I don't know. It might be kinda rough.
- Why?

265
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,600
They might have changed the password.

266
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,300
Maybe they didn't. Can't we at least try?

267
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,700
- Damn!
- Please.

268
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,400
OK.

269
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:57,000
- You owe me a quarter.
- Yeah. Come on. Sorry I lost your game.

270
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,400
- What's it doing?
- Oh. It's dialling numbers.

271
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:14,400
- Don't touch the keys!
- I'm not touching the keys.

272
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,100
Excuse me.

273
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:21,600
This computer company's coming out
with these amazing new games soon.

274
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,600
The programs are probably
still on their computer.

275
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,400
So I told my system to search for other
computers in Sunnyvale, California.

276
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,600
They answer with a tone that other
computers can recognise. You hear?

277
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,200
You're calling every number
in Sunnyvale?

278
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,400
- Isn't that expensive?
- There's ways around that.

279
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,300
You can go to jail for that.

280
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,500
Only if you're over 18.

281
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Is this going to take a long time?
I'd like to get my grade changed.

282
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,900
Oh. That's funny, actually.

283
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,100
Cos...

284
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,400
I already changed it.

285
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,800
- I told you not to do that.
- Yeah, I know.

286
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:12,000
But I figured you'd change your mind.
I didn't want you to flunk.

287
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,600
- Well, what did I get?
- You got a D.

288
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:19,100
- You gave me a D?
- No. You got an A.

289
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,300
- I was kidding.
- Oh.

290
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,600
Well, that's OK.

291
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,900
Here. Let's see what we have so far.

292
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,600
Excuse me.

293
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,800
Did you really give me an A?

294
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,000
Yeah.

295
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,200
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

296
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,200
Hey! You got a bank!

297
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,500
Gotta make a note of that one.
Might come in handy someday.

298
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,600
Pan Am.

299
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,500
- Where shall we go?
- Anywhere?

300
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,600
- Anywhere.
- New York?

301
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:01,600
- New York. OK.
- No, Paris. Paris.

302
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,900
Will you be travelling alone?

303
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,700
Yeah... No. You wanna go with me?

304
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,400
OK.

305
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,800
- All right. Smoking or nonsmoking?
- Nonsmoking.

306
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:24,800
All right, Miss Mack. You're
confirmed on Pan Am's flight 114

307
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:29,800
Ieaving Chicago's O'Hare Airport
at 8.15am on 18 August.

308
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,600
Do we need a rental car? No.

309
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:37,200
- Do we really have tickets to Paris?
- No. You have a reservation though.

310
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,000
It doesn't identify itself.

311
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,500
Try anything.

312
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,300
"Connection terminated." How rude.

313
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,600
We'll ask it for help.

314
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,900
- Can you do that?
- On some systems.

315
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,200
The more complicated they are,
the more they have to help you out.

316
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,300
Now what?

317
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,200
Help games.

318
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,200
"Games" refers to models,
simulations and games

319
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,600
which have strategic applications.
What does that mean?

320
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,800
I don't know. That's gotta be them.
Turn on the printer.

321
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,500
List games.

322
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,700
Oh, my God!

323
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:16,000
So these guys can tell you
what that print-out means?

324
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:19,100
They probably invented it
in the first place.

325
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,400
- Can you wait here?
- Why?

326
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:43,400
- Cos these guys can get a little nervous.
- OK.

327
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,700
Jim.

328
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,000
Oh. Lightman.

329
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Hi, Lightman!

330
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,200
I want you to take a look at this.

331
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,500
- Hey! What's that?
- I wanted Jim to see that.

332
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Wow! Where'd you get this?

333
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,600
Protovision. I wanted to see
the program for their new games.

334
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,200
- Can I have this?
- I'm not through yet.

335
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:31,300
Remember you told me to tell you when
you were acting rudely and insensitively?

336
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,400
You're doing it right now.

337
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:42,700
"Theatrewide biotoxic
and chemical warfare."

338
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:48,800
- This didn't come from Protovision.
- Ask him where it did come from, Jim!

339
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:52,100
- I told you already.
- Looks military to me. Definitely.

340
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:56,100
- Probably classified, too.
- If it's military, why does it have games

341
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:00,600
- Iike checkers and backgammon?
- Those games teach basic strategy.

342
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,900
Jim, how do I get into that system?
I wanna play those games.

343
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:08,300
That system probably contains
the new data encryption algorithm.

344
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:12,200
- You'll never get in.
- No system is totally secure.

345
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,800
- I bet you Jim could get in.
- I bet you he couldn't!

346
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,400
- I bet you he could.
- You won't get through frontline security.

347
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:22,000
- But you might look for a back door.
- I can't believe it, Jim!

348
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,200
That girl's listening,
and you talk about back doors!

349
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,500
Mr Potato-head.

350
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,500
Mr Potato-head!
Back doors are not secrets!

351
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,500
- You're giving away all our best tricks.
- They're not tricks.

352
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,700
- What's a back door?
- Whenever I design a system

353
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,300
I put in a password
that only I know about.

354
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,200
That way, whenever I wanna get back in,

355
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:47,000
I can bypass whatever security they've
added on. That's basically what it is.

356
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,200
Yeah?

357
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:53,800
OK. You really wanna get in, find out
about the guy who designed the system.

358
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,300
Come on! I don't even
know the guy's name.

359
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:01,400
Boy, are you guys dumb! You guys are
so dumb. I got this thing all figured out.

360
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:04,200
Oh, yeah, Malvin? How would you do it?

361
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:08,400
The first game in the list.
Go right through Falken's Maze.

362
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,600
Hi! I'm Jennifer.

363
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,800
- Is David here?
- How do you do?

364
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Yeah. He's up in his room.

365
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,200
Thanks.

366
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,100
Have you ever heard
of the word tumulus?

367
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:30,000
Tumulus? No. I haven't. I'm sorry.

368
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,200
Neither have l.

369
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,600
Yeah?

370
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:37,900
Hi!

371
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,900
- Where have you been?
- What?

372
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:44,200
I haven't seen you all week in school.
Are you sick?

373
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,200
No, no. I was...

374
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:51,500
I was doing things.
You wanna sit down? How are you?

375
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:54,200
- No. I'm going to get some water, OK?
- OK.

376
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,900
- What is all that stuff?
- Oh, it's nothing. I was just...

377
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:02,200
I was trying to find out about the guy
who designed those game programs,

378
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,700
so I could get his secret password.

379
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:07,400
- Why?
- Why? Cos...

380
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,800
What's so special about playing
games with some machine?

381
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,200
Oh, no...

382
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,600
No, it's not just some machine.

383
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,000
Here. Look at this.

384
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,700
This is a tape that I got from the library.

385
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
It's about this guy named Falken.

386
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,400
He was into games as well as computers.

387
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:30,200
He designed them so that
they could play checkers or poker.

388
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,800
- Chess.
- What's so great about that?

389
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:36,500
- Everybody's doing that now.
- Oh, no, no. What he did was great!

390
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:40,200
He designed his computer
so it could learn from its mistakes.

391
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,000
So they'd be better
the next time they played.

392
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,800
The system actually learned how to learn.

393
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,800
It could teach itself.

394
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,700
If I could just get that damn password,
I could play the computer.

395
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,500
That's him. That's Falken.

396
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,900
That's him? Wow!

397
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,100
He's amazing-looking!

398
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,300
Can't you write to him
or call him somehow?

399
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,800
No. He's dead.

400
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,800
- He's dead?
- Yeah.

401
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,100
Here. Look. Here's his obituary.

402
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:21,200
- He wasn't very old.
- Well, he was pretty old. He was 41 .

403
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,200
Oh, yeah? Oh, that's old.

404
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:29,000
That's his little boy.

405
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,200
Oh, yeah?

406
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:36,400
This is really sad. Did you know the child
and his mother were killed in a car crash?

407
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,800
- I know.
- "ln the years that followed

408
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
the tragic loss of his family,
Dr Falken's health deteriorated."

409
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,200
My dad is 45.

410
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,500
- Once he was really sick...
- What was his name?

411
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:03,100
- My father?
- No, no, no. Falken's kid.

412
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,200
Joshua.

413
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,300
It can't be that simple.

414
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,000
- Wow!
- What?

415
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:24,100
We got something.

416
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,700
We're in!

417
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,500
It thinks I'm Falken!

418
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:40,900
Hello.

419
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:49,500
- How can it ask you that?
- It'll ask whatever it's programmed to.

420
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,800
- Do you wanna hear it talk?
- Yeah!

421
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,500
I'll ask it how it feels.

422
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,500
I'm fine. How are... you?

423
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,900
Excellent. It's been a long time.

424
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:12,200
Can you explain the removal of
your useraccount on June 23rd, 1973?

425
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,600
They must have told it he died.

426
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,700
People sometimes make... mistakes.

427
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:24,700
- Yes, they do.
- How can it talk?

428
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:29,900
It's not a real voice. This box interprets
signals and turns them into sound.

429
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,700
Shall we play a game?

430
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,300
Oh!

431
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,200
- I think it missed him.
- Yeah. Weird, isn't it?

432
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,000
Love to!

433
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:46,200
How about Global Thermonuclear War?

434
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:51,600
Wouldn't you prefer
a good game ofchess?

435
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,700
Later.

436
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Let's play

437
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:58,200
Global Thermonuclear War.

438
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,200
Fine.

439
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,900
All right!

440
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,800
Wow!

441
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,400
Which side do you want?

442
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,600
I'll be the Russians.

443
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,300
Please listprimary targets.

444
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,900
- Who shall we nuke first?
- Let's see.

445
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,800
How about... Las Vegas?

446
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,400
Las Vegas! Great!

447
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,800
- What next? Seattle!
- Yeah!

448
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:38,100
Kill 'em!

449
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:52,400
I have seven, correction, eight Red birds
two degrees past apogee.

450
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,700
Better get the old man down here.

451
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
We have Soviet missile warning.

452
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,600
Check formalfunction
and report confiidence.

453
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:05,900
Projected target areas
NORAD regions 25, 26.

454
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:24,300
This is Crystal Palace initiating
emergency conference. Stand by!

455
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,500
19 degrees past apogee.

456
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:33,900
Possible 18 targets in track.
Estimate re-entry at 19.23 Zulu.

457
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:45,300
- What you got up here, Joe?
- We have a radar tracking.

458
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:48,600
Eight inbound Soviet ICBMs
already over the pole.

459
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:52,500
Estimated impact: 11 minutes.
Target area: Western United States.

460
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,900
- Why didn't we get a launch detection?
- We're checking for DSP malfunction.

461
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:00,900
BMEWS has continuous radar tracking
on inbounds.

462
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:05,000
Confidence is high.
I repeat, confidence is high.

463
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,400
- What is all that stuff?
- Trajectory headings

464
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:17,100
- for multiple-impact re-entry vehicles.
- What does that mean?

465
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,300
I don't know. But it's great!

466
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:22,200
- Are those bombs? Which is the bombs?
- Subs.

467
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,600
- Blow 'em up.
- Blow 'em out of the water.

468
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,400
- What's a trajectory heading?
- I've no idea.

469
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:35,800
The president's diverting to Andrews.
The vice president is out of position.

470
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:41,200
- The chairman of the Joint Chiefs is on...
- Missile warning reports no malfunction.

471
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,500
Take us to DEFCON 3.

472
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:46,400
Get onto SAC.
Tell 'em to flush the bombers.

473
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:47,900
Yes, sir.

474
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:53,700
SAC, this is Crystal Palace.
CinC NORAD has declared DEFCON 3.

475
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:58,800
Scramble all alert aircraft.
I repeat, scramble all alert aircraft.

476
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,100
Inbounds presently MIRVing.

477
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,800
We now have approximately
24 possible targets in track.

478
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,400
- New time to impact: eight minutes.
- SAC is launching the bombers.

479
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:12,300
- General Powers is on the line.
- Beringer.

480
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:17,600
Goddamn it! We didn't get
a launch detection from our satellite.

481
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Radar picked 'em up already out of the
atmosphere. That's the first we heard of it.

482
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:27,000
Get the ICBMs in the bullpen
warmed up and ready to fly.

483
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:31,000
- Get me the president on the horn.
- Yes, sir.

484
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:40,700
Mr President? This is Beringer at NORAD.

485
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,900
Oh, attack!

486
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:46,700
- I wonder if I should use my subs.
- Sure. Give 'em the works.

487
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:49,000
David!

488
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,400
Excuse me.

489
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,600
David!

490
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:58,400
How many times have I told you
to fasten these lids on tight?!

491
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,500
- Look at this mess!
- I'll be down in a few minutes.

492
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:04,300
Now! Come down now!
I want this cleared up now!

493
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:08,500
Come down here and do what
your father asks you to pronto, David.

494
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,300
We're gonna barbecue tonight.

495
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:14,700
- You wanna invite your little friend?
- Please!

496
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:15,900
David!

497
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:20,300
Shit!

498
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,100
Little friend.

499
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:40,300
Mr President, something's happening.
I'll get back to you as soon as I know.

500
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:45,600
- What's happening, Joe?
- BMEWS and Cobra Dane now report

501
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,100
negative confirmation
on all inbound tracking.

502
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:53,000
Get onto SAC. Tell 'em to hold steady.

503
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,700
Stop! It's a simulation!
There's an attack simulation running!

504
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,300
What the hell's he yelling about?
I didn't order that.

505
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:04,300
We're not being attacked!
It's a simulation!

506
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,200
Whoa, now! Hold it!

507
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:08,400
You're not supposed to be runnin' here.

508
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,600
We don't know how it happened.

509
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:14,600
Someone outside fed an attack simulation
into the main... It's a simulation!

510
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:16,400
Conley...

511
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,400
Take us off full alert.

512
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:23,100
Hold at DEFCON 4 till we find out exactly
what in the hell's happening here!

513
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:27,700
I didn't tell you to cut the line!
Did I tell you to cut it? You cut the line!

514
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,700
They shut down
before we could complete our trace.

515
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:33,900
We did locate the area
where the transmission originated.

516
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:36,200
- Where?
- Seattle, Washington.

517
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,200
Shut it down!

518
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,600
Somebody's playing a game with us.

519
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:43,100
At a prophylactic recycling centre...

520
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:44,400
Hi, Dad!

521
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,400
David!

522
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,400
- David, come in here!
- What did I do?

523
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,600
Plenty, mister. Plenty.

524
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:56,800
You have just passed
all of your classes this semester.

525
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:59,000
Congratulations, dear!

526
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:01,200
Show this to your dad.

527
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:04,600
Honey! David has something to show you.

528
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:06,800
- What's that?
- Here, Dad.

529
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,800
Uh-oh.

530
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,100
This is good!

531
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,300
I'm so proud of you!

532
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,700
..went on a full-scale nuclearalert,

533
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
believing the Soviet Union
had launched a missile attack.

534
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:24,500
A spokesman places blame
on a computermalfunction,

535
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:27,800
emphasising that the problem
has been corrected.

536
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:31,200
For more on the story,
let's go live to Washington DC.

537
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:36,000
Well, that's your phone.

538
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:38,200
Yeah.

539
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:42,400
Seriously, David. Congratulations.
This one'll be a pleasure to sign!

540
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,700
- Hello?
- David?

541
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:52,600
Are you watching the news?

542
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:55,300
Jennifer. Yeah, I'm watching.

543
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:58,100
David, is that us on TV? Did we do that?

544
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:00,700
It could be. Oh, Jesus, Jennifer!

545
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:04,900
What am I gonna do? They're gonna
come get me. I'm really screwed!

546
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,200
I'm screwed!

547
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:11,000
No! Sh! Calm down!
Sh! Calm down, calm down. Listen...

548
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:14,200
If they were so smart,
they would have found you already.

549
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,300
Yeah.

550
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:19,700
OK. So all you have to do is throw
the number away and don't call it again.

551
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,200
- That's all.
- Yeah.

552
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:26,200
- Maybe they didn't trace the call.
- Right! Maybe they didn't trace the call.

553
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:30,300
I'm sure they didn't trace the call.
All you have to do is act normal.

554
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:33,300
We'll both act normal
and everything will be fine.

555
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:34,900
OK?

556
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,900
- OK.
- OK.

557
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:41,700
God! This is so unbelievable!
Can I call Michelle and tell her?

558
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
No, Jennifer! Don't call her!

559
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:47,900
Sorry. All right. I won't.
I'll talk to you tomorrow, OK?

560
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:50,500
OK. Good night, Jennifer.

561
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,800
Greetings, ProfessorFalken.

562
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:26,700
Oh, my God.

563
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:38,300
Incorrect identification.

564
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,800
I am not Falken.

565
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,900
Falken is dead.

566
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:48,200
Sorry to hear that, Professor.

567
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,800
Yesterday's game was interrupted.

568
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:56,700
Although primary goal has not yet
been achieved, solution is near.

569
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:02,300
Game time elapsed:
31 hours 12 minutes 50 seconds.

570
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:09,400
Estimated time remaining:
52 hours 17 minutes 10 seconds.

571
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:14,100
What is the primary goal?

572
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:19,100
You should know, Professor.
You programmed me.

573
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:21,400
Oh, come on.

574
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:25,100
What is the primary goal?

575
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,600
To win the game.

576
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,100
David Lightman, hold it right there. FBl.

577
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:03,800
- I'll read you your rights.
- Step over to the van.

578
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:06,700
You have the absolute right
to remain silent.

579
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,900
What did I do?

580
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,500
You have the right
to consult with an attorney

581
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:14,000
and to have one present
during questioning.

582
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:17,900
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be appointed to you by the court.

583
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:20,500
- Do you understand these rights?
- Yeah.

584
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:24,200
Are you willing to talk to me
about the charges against you?

585
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,400
All right. Let's move.

586
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,700
This rather large room
is command centre for NORAD.

587
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:46,400
No picture taking. The screens in front
of you are connected to our satellites

588
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:49,700
and missile tracking stations
throughout the country.

589
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
This is the commander's desk.
Colonel Conley is in charge.

590
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,900
Would you mind relinquishing
your command, sir?

591
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:59,800
Miss Dailey, would you come
and sit in this rather important chair?

592
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:03,500
These buttons are connected
with the Strategic Air Command

593
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:05,800
and missile launching stations.

594
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,200
Miss Dailey, would you press
this button here? The red one.

595
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:11,400
- The one in the middle?
- Yes, ma'am.

596
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:14,000
Oh, my God! It's the wrong one!

597
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:17,600
It's a joke! You didn't blow up anything.
Look what you did do.

598
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:20,600
"Distinguished visitors
from Birmingham."

599
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:53,500
Last week I had the governor
of New Jersey in this chair.

600
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:57,800
He said, "Colonel Thomas, why are we
at DEFCON 4?" as we are right now.

601
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:00,000
Why are we at DEFCON 4?

602
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:03,100
The Soviets saw our bombers scramble
and went on alert.

603
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:08,000
We told them it was just an exercise, but
we want them to relax their posture first.

604
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:09,500
Wait. Wait.

605
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:12,100
- Give me that.
- Oh, Christ. Another tour group.

606
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:16,300
Just what we need today. Why don't they
go to Disneyland where they belong?

607
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:20,500
- Well, I think they're going to tomorrow.
- OK. All set? Oh, here.

608
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:25,800
It was a one-in-a-million shot.

609
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:28,800
There was an open line
at our division in Sunnyvale.

610
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
The phone company screwed up!

611
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:34,100
- John. John McKittrick, George Wigan.
- How are you?

612
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,800
George is with the FBl.
He brought the kid in.

613
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,100
It looks like we've got
a high-school prank on our hands.

614
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,100
Paul, what happened?

615
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:46,900
The kid broke into the war game using a
password left by the original programmer.

616
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,700
- A password?
- Yes, sir.

617
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,900
None of my team even knew it was there.

618
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,600
Kid claims
he was looking for a toy company.

619
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,100
That's great!
Anybody in here buy that one?

620
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:02,000
We can find the password and take it out,
but it might help to beef up security.

621
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:04,200
Oh. Beef up, huh?

622
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,400
How about screwed up?

623
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:09,200
We did all that and he broke in again.

624
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:12,100
Kid says your computer called him.

625
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:14,800
What the hell is going on, John?

626
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,900
I woke up the president. I told him
we were under attack by the Russians.

627
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:23,300
You know what an idiot that makes me
look? Not to mention the general.

628
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,700
I think we're being a little naive here.

629
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:27,800
There is no way a high-school punk

630
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:30,900
can put a dime in a telephone
and break into our system.

631
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,400
He's got to be working
with somebody else.

632
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:37,300
He fits the profile perfectly.
He's intelligent, but an underachiever.

633
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,300
Alienated from his parents.
Has few friends.

634
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:42,900
Classic case
for recruitment by the Soviets.

635
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,700
What does this say
about the state of our country?

636
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,300
I mean, have you gotten any insight
as to why a bright boy like this

637
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:52,900
would jeopardise the lives of millions?

638
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:55,200
He says
he does this sort of thing for fun.

639
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:58,700
Dammit, John, I want some answers,
and I want 'em now!

640
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:05,800
- Let me talk to this little prick.
- I don't wanna talk. Just do it!

641
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:09,600
Come on, Paul.

642
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:15,300
Who do they belong to? Do you know?

643
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:16,800
What?

644
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:18,300
Good morning, sir.

645
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,400
- Where's the Lightman kid?
- In the infirmary, sir.

646
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:34,600
Hello, David. John McKittrick.
I run the computer facility here.

647
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:37,500
Sergeant, these aren't necessary,
the handcuffs?

648
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:39,100
No, sir.

649
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:43,400
Well, David, we called your parents.

650
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:46,000
We told them everything's fine.

651
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:48,900
No charges have been filed... yet.

652
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:53,700
But I think we are gonna need
a little time to sort things out here.

653
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:55,800
How much time?

654
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,300
Well, that depends on
how willing you are to cooperate.

655
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:01,500
Oh, of course.

656
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:07,000
Sergeant, would you tell the OD
I'm gonna take David for a little walk?

657
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:10,800
Let's go down to my office.
We'll be more comfortable there.

658
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:13,100
Go ahead.

659
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,600
You used to work with Stephen Falken?

660
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:21,900
I started as his assistant.
How d'you know?

661
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:25,300
I read an article you wrote with him
on poker and nuclear war.

662
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,700
Bluffing. Yeah,
that shook a few people up.

663
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,900
- He must have been pretty amazing.
- He's a brilliant man. A little flaky.

664
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:36,200
He never understood the practical uses
of his... of his work.

665
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:39,600
This machine over here
runs his game program.

666
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:41,300
Joshua.

667
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:45,400
Come here a minute, David.

668
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,500
See that sign up here? Up here?

669
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:51,200
- Yeah.
- DEFCON.

670
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:54,700
That indicates
our current defence condition.

671
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,800
It should read DEFCON 5,
which means peace.

672
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,400
It's still on 4 because of
that little stunt you pulled.

673
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:05,900
Actually, if we hadn't caught it in time,
it might have gone to DEFCON 1 .

674
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:09,400
- You know what that means, David?
- No. What does that mean?

675
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:11,200
World War III.

676
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:13,600
Wow.

677
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:16,600
You broke into our system
just to play a game, right?

678
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:19,200
That's right. That's exactly right.

679
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:26,400
After the news, you must have
realised how serious it was.

680
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:28,900
- Why'd you do it again?
- I didn't do it again.

681
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:31,900
- I even threw the number away.
- They found it in the trash.

682
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:33,400
Joshua called me.

683
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:35,500
Hey!

684
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:37,800
Look at that! That's some setup.

685
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:41,200
- What did you say?
- This is some setup.

686
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:43,200
No, no. Before that.

687
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:45,300
Joshua called me.

688
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,200
David, machines don't call people.

689
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:52,500
Yours did.

690
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,400
Who are you going to Paris with?

691
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:01,600
Paris? Oh!

692
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:03,600
No... You don't understand.

693
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:06,100
You had reservations for two to Paris.

694
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:11,600
- Who are you working with?
- Nobody!

695
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,700
Why don't I believe you?

696
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:22,400
I don't think I should say anything else
until I talk to a lawyer.

697
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,100
I think we'd better forget
about the lawyer crap

698
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:29,800
until I get a few answers
out of you myself.

699
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:50,400
Are you gonna answer the phone?

700
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:55,800
Hello.

701
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:57,100
Yeah.

702
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:58,300
What?

703
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
All right. I'll be right down.

704
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:04,100
You stay here. Don't move.

705
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:17,100
What's going on?

706
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:21,100
There's been a serious penetration
into our WOPR execution order file.

707
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:23,600
- What the hell's he sayin'?
- In English.

708
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:27,200
I'll give it to you. Somebody got
into Mr McKittrick's system

709
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:30,100
and stole the codes
that'll launch our missiles.

710
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:33,900
There's no cause for alarm.
The system won't accept a launch code

711
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:37,800
unless we're at DEFCON 1 .
I can change those codes in an hour.

712
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,400
Well, who did this?

713
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:42,400
I think the kid's working
with somebody on the outside.

714
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:47,100
I don't know what they're up to, but
I don't want our bombers on the ground.

715
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:50,500
Take us to DEFCON 3
and get SAC on the line.

716
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:53,200
- Where are you?
- Sir.

717
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:57,600
Get me an update on those subs. I wanna
know what those bastards are up to.

718
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:27,100
Joshua.

719
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:30,500
Greetings, ProfessorFalken.

720
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:34,800
Hello.

721
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,700
Are you still playing the game?

722
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:42,600
Of course. I should reach DEFCON 1

723
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:46,400
and launch my missiles in 28 hours.

724
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:51,000
Would you like to see
some projected kill ratios?

725
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:53,700
69% of the housing destroyed.

726
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:57,000
72 million people dead?

727
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,700
Is this a game

728
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,100
or is it real?

729
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:08,100
What's the difference?

730
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,400
Oh, wow.

731
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:13,800
You are a hard man to reach.

732
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,900
Could not fiind you in Seattle

733
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:20,700
and no terminal is in operation
at your classifiied address.

734
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:30,000
What classified address?

735
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:36,000
DOD pension fiiles
indicate current mailing as:

736
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:40,800
Dr Robert Hume.

737
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:43,800
AKA Stephen WFalken.

738
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:50,800
5 Tall CedarRoad,
Goose lsland, Oregon 97...

739
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:55,000
Can I just talk to Mr McKittrick?
I think I know what's going on.

740
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:58,800
I'm escorting you to Denver
where you'll be placed under arrest,

741
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:01,900
- pending indictment for espionage.
- Espionage?!

742
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:04,500
Let me talk to him!
He's right over there.

743
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:08,800
- Get that bastard out of the war room!
- No! It's Joshua!

744
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,000
He's still playing the game!
He's gonna start a war!

745
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:15,300
Hold him where you had him before.
We'll leave in a few minutes.

746
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:19,600
Call Falken. He'll tell you. Please,
call him. Please, call him. Call him!

747
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:22,300
What the hell's he doing in here anyway?

748
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,300
Some of the men told me
that you're quite a tennis player.

749
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:58,900
Patient's eyes are dilated, consistent
with use ofmarijuana andpossibly PCP.

750
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:32,100
Depending on what information you want,
there's a button to press.

751
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:35,300
Let's say I wanted to find out
how to hit a backhand.

752
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:37,900
I don't think I have the right program.

753
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:40,600
Excuse me. What do you want?

754
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:43,100
Bathroom. It's a long ride to Denver.

755
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:45,300
Excuse me.

756
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:53,100
Please! Let me talk to Mr McKittrick.

757
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:56,300
You can't talk to anybody.
The FBl'll be here any minute.

758
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:59,000
- Do you have to take a leak or not?
- No.

759
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,400
- I'm working here.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

760
01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:30,600
Stop it!

761
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:33,600
- You have pretty eyes.
- That's original.

762
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:40,200
I'll get the elevator.

763
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,400
- Sign in here?
- Yeah, get us all.

764
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:09,000
I heard they voted you
Miss Fine in 1979. Is that true?

765
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:11,300
Will you stop it?!

766
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:13,400
- Am I bothering you?
- Yes.

767
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:16,100
- Do you want me to leave?
- Yes.

768
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:30,600
I want this door open right now.

769
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:34,500
- How about getting on the phone?
- Is there a technician?

770
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:10,900
Hey, Scooter! Wait up.

771
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:14,400
Come on, hurry it up. I'm late.

772
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:16,500
OK. I'll be right with you.

773
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:20,100
- I think it's jammed from inside.
- Come on.

774
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:24,700
David! Come on, David.
You're just making it harder on yourself.

775
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:29,500
OK.

776
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:31,700
Let's go.

777
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:42,300
Right this way, folks. I've been informed

778
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:45,900
that they're cleaning the floors
in the computer centre.

779
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:50,100
Don't want anyone to slip and hurt
themselves, so we'll end the tour here.

780
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:53,700
If I can ask you to board the bus
as quickly as possible,

781
01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:58,000
you'll have a complimentary beverage
waiting for each of you.

782
01:09:58,300 --> 01:10:00,100
Hold it! What are you doing?

783
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,400
Got it. Here it comes.

784
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:08,700
- You kids think you own this place?
- Oh! I was... just looking around.

785
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:12,900
You're not supposed to leave the group.
So get back there!

786
01:10:13,300 --> 01:10:15,900
OK. Excuse me.
Thank you very much, sir.

787
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:18,800
Out of the way.

788
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:22,500
Thank you. Careful there.

789
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:24,900
Take care. Watch your step.

790
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:27,000
- Bye.
- Bye now.

791
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:28,700
Watch your step.

792
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:32,200
- Check everywhere. He can't be far.
- Move it, will you?

793
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:29,600
- Thanks.
- Take care.

794
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:31,800
Bye.

795
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,200
- What city, please?
- Goose lsland, Oregon, please.

796
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:14,000
The number for Dr Robert Hume,
H-U-M-E, on Tall Cedar Road.

797
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:20,000
Checking underDrRobert Hume,
H-U-M-E, on Tall CedarRoad,

798
01:13:20,300 --> 01:13:22,000
I fiind no listing.

799
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:24,800
What does that mean?
He doesn't have a phone?

800
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
I'm sorry. I have no listing.

801
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:29,200
Oh, wait.

802
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:34,500
Falken. Dr Stephen Falken,
F-A-L-K-E-N, at the same address.

803
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:39,600
I fiind no listing
for a Dr Stephen Falken, F-A-L-K-E-N,

804
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:42,000
on Tall CedarRoad, Goose lsland.

805
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:44,100
Thank you.

806
01:14:00,700 --> 01:14:01,600
Yeah?

807
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:03,400
Jennifer? It's me. David.

808
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:05,300
- David?
- Yeah.

809
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:07,800
Listen, I'm in Colorado

810
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,200
and I need a really big favour.

811
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:12,700
- Can you lend me some money?
- What?

812
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:15,700
I need an airline ticket.
I'll pay you back when I can.

813
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:18,800
I need a ticket from Grand Junction,
Colorado to Oregon.

814
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:22,000
- Why? What's going on?
- I'll tell you all about it later.

815
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:24,500
David, what are you doing in Colorado?

816
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:27,600
I went by yourhouse.
Your parents werejust freaked.

817
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:30,900
There are men around from the FBI
asking questions.

818
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:33,100
I can't talk about it right now.

819
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:38,600
When you buy the ticket, tell them that
I'll pick it up in Grand Junction Airport.

820
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,900
David, what's happening?

821
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:45,300
I can't talk. I've gotta get off the phone.
Please, will you just do this for me?

822
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:52,600
Punch up number five.
Let me see what you have.

823
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:57,800
22 Typhoon-class submarines
departing Petropavlovsk,

824
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:01,300
turning southbound at Nordkapp,
bearing 095 degrees.

825
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:03,700
Sergeant, I hope you like vodka.

826
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:08,300
Yes, sir. I just hope they don't make me
eat none of them damn fish eggs.

827
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:15,400
Give me an update...

828
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:19,300
Sir, the Soviets deny any increase
in their submarine deployment.

829
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:21,700
They wanna know
why we're provoking them.

830
01:15:21,900 --> 01:15:24,700
They're full of shit.
We know they're down there.

831
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,500
I'm gonna blow their ass out of the water.

832
01:16:08,700 --> 01:16:10,200
Surprise!

833
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:15,300
- What are you doing here?
- You didn't sound too good on the phone.

834
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:18,600
- You shouldn't have come. I'm in trouble.
- Why?

835
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:22,300
Is this because of
what you did with my grade?

836
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:32,300
You kids better hustle.
The ferry leaves any second.

837
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:34,500
Thanks. Come on. We gotta run.

838
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:42,300
- Wait, wait, wait, wait! Whoa!
- Hold it, hold it!

839
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:55,000
If he's still alive,
why would the obituary say he's dead?

840
01:16:55,300 --> 01:16:57,200
No, he's not dead. He left.

841
01:16:57,500 --> 01:17:00,800
When they know too much,
they give 'em new identities.

842
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:04,000
- Anyway, the computer said so.
- Oh, the computer said so.

843
01:17:04,300 --> 01:17:08,400
The computer that's still playing
the games? It's the military's computer!

844
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:12,200
- Why wouldn't they know about it?
- They don't know about Joshua.

845
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:16,100
Falken knows about Joshua. He's
the only one who knows what it can do.

846
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:20,200
That computer is trying to win the game
that we asked it to play.

847
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:22,400
For real!

848
01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:24,700
You don't even believe me!

849
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:32,000
David... David.

850
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:35,700
- He's not dead.
- I'm sorry.

851
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:41,400
I believe you.

852
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:30,600
Oh!

853
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:32,100
What was that?

854
01:18:32,300 --> 01:18:33,900
I don't know.

855
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:43,300
Did you see that? There are still people
who won't believe they could fly.

856
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:45,600
The sky was once filled with them.

857
01:18:45,900 --> 01:18:49,500
- I'm looking for Dr Robert Hume.
- Is either of you a palaeontologist?

858
01:18:49,700 --> 01:18:51,700
No. We're high-school students.

859
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:53,900
Oh... Pity.

860
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:56,800
Well, high-school students,

861
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,700
you're on my land and I didn't invite you.

862
01:18:59,900 --> 01:19:00,800
But

863
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:03,300
aren't you Stephen Falken?

864
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:06,400
Now, listen carefully.

865
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Path. Follow path.

866
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:13,000
Gate. Open gate, through gate, close gate.

867
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:15,600
Last ferry 6.30, so run, run, run.

868
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:18,100
Wait! Wait.

869
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:20,300
I came because of Joshua.

870
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:06,600
Radar reports two unknown tracks are
penetrating the Alaskan air defence zone.

871
01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:12,000
Confidence is high. Flight profile
suggests Soviet backfire bombers.

872
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:16,700
I want a visual confirmation on that.
Scramble two F-16s out of Galena.

873
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:20,600
Go to DEFCON 2.

874
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:58,100
Crystal Palace, this is Delta Foxtrot 27.
I have negative radar contact.

875
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:00,500
Repeat, negative Soviet aircraft.

876
01:21:00,700 --> 01:21:03,700
27, this is Brass Hat.
They're right in front of you!

877
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:05,900
You're almost on top of 'em.

878
01:21:06,100 --> 01:21:08,600
Brass Hat, we got nothing on radar

879
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:10,800
and 40 miles visibility.

880
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:14,600
There's nothin' out there, General.
Just blue skies.

881
01:21:14,900 --> 01:21:16,900
What the hell?!

882
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:30,300
- You haven't been listening.
- Yes, I have.

883
01:21:30,500 --> 01:21:32,800
I loved it when you nuked Las Vegas.

884
01:21:33,100 --> 01:21:36,300
A suitably biblical ending for the place,
don't you think?

885
01:21:36,700 --> 01:21:39,200
Are you gonna tell them
what Joshua's doing?

886
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:45,400
Now, children, come on over here.
I'm going to tell you a bedtime story.

887
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:48,000
Are you sitting comfortably?

888
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:50,000
Then I'll begin.

889
01:21:50,300 --> 01:21:56,100
Once upon a time, there lived
a magnificent race of animals

890
01:21:56,500 --> 01:21:59,500
who dominated the world
through age after age.

891
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:01,500
They ran and they swam

892
01:22:01,700 --> 01:22:03,900
and they fought and they flew.

893
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:08,000
Until suddenly,
quite recently, they disappeared.

894
01:22:09,100 --> 01:22:12,500
Nature just gave up and started again.

895
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:15,400
We weren't even apes then.

896
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:19,500
We were just these smart little rodents
hiding in the rocks.

897
01:22:19,700 --> 01:22:23,300
And when we go, nature will start again.

898
01:22:24,300 --> 01:22:26,300
With the bees probably.

899
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:29,700
Nature knows when to give up, David.

900
01:22:29,900 --> 01:22:31,900
I'm not giving up.

901
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:35,800
If Joshua tricks them
into launching an attack, it'll be your fault.

902
01:22:36,700 --> 01:22:40,700
My fault? The whole point was
to find a way to practise nuclear war

903
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:43,000
without destroying ourselves.

904
01:22:43,300 --> 01:22:47,000
To get the computers to learn from
mistakes we couldn't afford to make.

905
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:50,600
Except I never could get Joshua
to learn the most important lesson.

906
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:52,200
What's that?

907
01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:56,600
Futility. That there's a time
when you should just give up.

908
01:22:56,900 --> 01:22:58,800
What kind of a lesson is that?

909
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:01,400
Did you ever play tic-tac-toe?

910
01:23:02,900 --> 01:23:04,200
Yeah. Of course.

911
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:06,400
- But you don't any more?
- No.

912
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:07,600
Why?

913
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:11,400
Because it's a boring game.
It's always a tie.

914
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:13,800
Exactly. There's no way to win.

915
01:23:13,900 --> 01:23:16,400
The game itself is pointless.

916
01:23:17,300 --> 01:23:21,100
But back at the war room,
they believe you can win a nuclear war.

917
01:23:22,300 --> 01:23:24,900
That there can be acceptable losses.

918
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:29,200
So you gave up? Decided to play dead?

919
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:34,100
For security reasons,
they graciously arranged my death.

920
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:37,900
Did you know that no land animal

921
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:41,500
with a body weight of over 50lb
survived that age?

922
01:23:42,700 --> 01:23:45,600
Extinction is part of the natural order.

923
01:23:45,900 --> 01:23:47,300
Bullshit!

924
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:52,000
If we're extinguished, it's not natural.
It's just stupid!

925
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:54,600
Oh, it's all right. I've planned ahead.

926
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:58,100
We're just three miles
from a primary target.

927
01:23:59,300 --> 01:24:01,400
A millisecond of brilliant light

928
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:03,300
and we're vaporised.

929
01:24:03,500 --> 01:24:07,600
Much more fortunate than the millions
who'll wander sightless

930
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,300
through the smouldering aftermath.

931
01:24:11,700 --> 01:24:14,100
We'll be spared the horror of survival.

932
01:24:14,900 --> 01:24:17,200
I'm only 17 years old.

933
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:20,300
I'm not ready to die yet.

934
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:22,700
You won't make a simple phone call?

935
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:28,200
If the real Joshua was still alive,
your Joshua,

936
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:31,600
- you'd do it, wouldn't you?
- Look, we might gain a few years.

937
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:35,100
Perhaps time enough for you
to have a son and watch him die.

938
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:39,600
But humanity
planning its own destruction...

939
01:24:40,700 --> 01:24:42,700
That a phone call won't stop.

940
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:47,600
This is unreal! You don't care about death
cos you're already dead.

941
01:24:49,700 --> 01:24:52,800
I know a lot about you.
I know you weren't always like this.

942
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,300
What was the last thing you cared about?

943
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:02,300
You've missed the last ferry.

944
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,300
You're welcome to stay.
You want to sleep on the floor?

945
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
Good night.

946
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:23,900
Let's get outta here.

947
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:37,200
Come on. We'll find a boat.
There's gotta be a boat.

948
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:58,600
Mr President, we've got 48 nuclear subs
closing on the United States.

949
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:02,300
And we've got 100,000 Soviet troops
massing in East Germany.

950
01:26:02,700 --> 01:26:05,700
We're monitoring their bombers
that are on alert. Yes, sir...

951
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:07,900
Well, that's a load of shit!

952
01:26:08,100 --> 01:26:09,600
No, sir. Not you.

953
01:26:09,700 --> 01:26:13,600
Yes, sir. We'll be in touch
as soon as the information changes.

954
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:18,000
Intelligence reports rumours of a new
Soviet bomber with Stealth capabilities.

955
01:26:18,300 --> 01:26:22,000
It can project a false radar image
600 miles away from the real aircraft.

956
01:26:22,300 --> 01:26:24,600
Christ! Now they got us chasing shadows.

957
01:26:37,100 --> 01:26:39,000
I think I saw one.

958
01:26:43,700 --> 01:26:48,100
What kind of an asshole lives on an island
and he doesn't even have a boat?

959
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:51,400
Maybe we can swim for it.
How far do you think it is?

960
01:26:51,700 --> 01:26:53,800
No. It's two or three miles.

961
01:26:54,100 --> 01:26:56,000
At least. Maybe more.

962
01:26:56,200 --> 01:26:58,800
- Well, what do you say? Let's go for it.
- No.

963
01:26:59,100 --> 01:27:00,700
- Come on.
- No!

964
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:02,100
I can't swim.

965
01:27:02,900 --> 01:27:04,800
You can't swim?

966
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
No. OK, Wonder Woman? I can't swim.

967
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:11,100
What kind of an asshole grows up
in Seattle and doesn't know how to swim?

968
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:13,500
I never got around to it, OK?

969
01:27:13,700 --> 01:27:16,800
I always thought
there was gonna be plenty of time!

970
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,100
I'm sorry.

971
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:25,900
I wish I didn't know about any of this.

972
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:30,100
I wish I was like
everybody else in the world.

973
01:27:31,100 --> 01:27:33,200
Then tomorrow it would just be over.

974
01:27:36,300 --> 01:27:38,600
There wouldn't be any time to be sorry.

975
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:42,100
About anything.

976
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:50,700
Oh, Jesus!

977
01:27:51,900 --> 01:27:54,200
I really wanted to learn how to swim.

978
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:57,400
I swear to God I did.

979
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:08,800
Did I tell you that next week

980
01:28:09,900 --> 01:28:11,900
I was gonna be on TV?

981
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,200
You're kidding?

982
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:17,700
On that aerobics show
with some girls from my dad's class.

983
01:28:17,900 --> 01:28:19,800
A movie star.

984
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,900
Yeah!

985
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:26,500
It's kinda stupid, huh? I mean, nobody
would have been watching me anyway.

986
01:28:26,900 --> 01:28:28,000
I would have.

987
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:49,000
Oh, Jesus!

988
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:51,200
The bastard turned us in!

989
01:29:52,700 --> 01:29:54,600
It's all right. Get in.

990
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:24,900
We have a launch detection.
We have a Soviet launch detection.

991
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:27,100
BMEWS has confiirmed a massive attack.

992
01:30:27,400 --> 01:30:30,300
- Missile warning. No malfunction.
- Confiidence is high.

993
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:33,600
- Cobra Dane, is this an exercise?
- This is not an exercise.

994
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:37,500
General, DPS is tracking
300 inbound Soviet ICBMs.

995
01:30:44,300 --> 01:30:47,400
- Tell me this is one of your simulations.
- It's not, Jack.

996
01:30:47,700 --> 01:30:51,200
All right. Flush the bombers.
Get the subs in launch mode.

997
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:54,400
We are at DEFCON 1 .

998
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:55,600
DEFCON 1.

999
01:30:59,100 --> 01:31:02,700
Major Lem, get me a report on the WOPR.

1000
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:08,400
Initial attack profile
is a full-scale Soviet strike.

1001
01:31:08,700 --> 01:31:12,500
WOPR is putting our losses
at 85 to 95% of the strategic forces.

1002
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:15,200
What does WOPR recommend,
Mr McKittrick?

1003
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:17,800
Full-scale retaliatory strike.

1004
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:21,600
I need some machine to tell me that?

1005
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:24,800
President's on his way
to join Airborne Command.

1006
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:26,800
We have to give launch option.

1007
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:30,500
- Has he spoken to the premier?
- The Russians deny everything.

1008
01:31:30,900 --> 01:31:33,200
We have a Soviet submarine
launch detection.

1009
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:37,200
Let's go into a launch mode.
Close up the mountain.

1010
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:47,600
This is Crystal Palace.
We're closing up the mountain.

1011
01:31:47,900 --> 01:31:50,900
After the gates are closed,
nobody gets in or out.

1012
01:31:57,800 --> 01:31:59,700
Initiate internal power.

1013
01:32:00,900 --> 01:32:02,900
Generators on and functioning.

1014
01:32:11,900 --> 01:32:13,900
External power disconnected.

1015
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:19,500
Seal off ventilation shafts.

1016
01:32:19,700 --> 01:32:21,500
Shaft locks sealed.

1017
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:28,400
The gate's closed!

1018
01:32:36,100 --> 01:32:37,900
Is everybody OK?

1019
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:40,500
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Run for it!

1020
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:46,000
The gate's gonna shut! Come on!

1021
01:32:46,300 --> 01:32:48,200
Come on!

1022
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:02,500
Hold the door! Hold the door!

1023
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:08,600
Hold the goddamn door!

1024
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:15,500
Come on! Hurry!

1025
01:33:18,300 --> 01:33:20,200
They're clear! They're clear!

1026
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:43,000
All units confirm weapons targeted
and ready. Awaiting launch codes.

1027
01:33:43,300 --> 01:33:45,200
We are in a launch mode.

1028
01:33:45,500 --> 01:33:47,700
Major Lem, lock out changes.

1029
01:33:47,900 --> 01:33:49,900
Roger. Lock out enabled.

1030
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,900
All right. I'll call you back.

1031
01:34:02,100 --> 01:34:04,500
Here!

1032
01:34:11,300 --> 01:34:14,400
I don't know what you think
you can do here, Stephen.

1033
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:18,200
John! Good to see you!
I see the wife still picks your ties.

1034
01:34:18,500 --> 01:34:21,700
- What has this kid been telling you?
- How far has it gone?

1035
01:34:21,900 --> 01:34:27,100
The president's ready for a counterstrike.
That's what we're recommending he do.

1036
01:34:29,100 --> 01:34:32,600
- It's a bluff, John. Call it off.
- No, it's not a bluff. It's real.

1037
01:34:32,900 --> 01:34:35,500
Hello, General Beringer? Stephen Falken.

1038
01:34:36,300 --> 01:34:39,200
Mr Falken, you picked
a hell of a day for a visit.

1039
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:43,500
General, what you see
on these screens up here is a fantasy.

1040
01:34:43,900 --> 01:34:46,600
A computer-enhanced hallucination.

1041
01:34:46,900 --> 01:34:50,000
Those blips are not real missiles.
They're phantoms.

1042
01:34:50,300 --> 01:34:54,300
There's nothing to indicate a simulation.
Everything's working perfectly.

1043
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:57,200
- Does it make any sense?
- Does what make any sense?

1044
01:34:57,600 --> 01:34:58,400
That!

1045
01:34:58,600 --> 01:35:02,000
Look, I don't have time
for a conversation right now.

1046
01:35:02,200 --> 01:35:05,500
General, are you prepared
to destroy the enemy?

1047
01:35:05,900 --> 01:35:06,800
You betcha!

1048
01:35:06,900 --> 01:35:10,800
- Do you think they know that?
- I believe we've made that clear enough.

1049
01:35:11,100 --> 01:35:12,900
Then... don't.

1050
01:35:13,100 --> 01:35:16,000
Tell the president to ride out the attack.

1051
01:35:16,300 --> 01:35:18,400
Sir, they need a decision.

1052
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:22,800
General, do you really believe
that the enemy would attack

1053
01:35:23,100 --> 01:35:26,300
without provocation,
using so many missiles and subs,

1054
01:35:26,500 --> 01:35:29,800
so that we would have no choice
but to totally annihilate them?

1055
01:35:30,100 --> 01:35:32,400
One minute and 30 seconds to impact.

1056
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:35,200
General, you are listening to a machine.

1057
01:35:36,300 --> 01:35:38,600
Do the world a favour
and don't act like one.

1058
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:46,000
One minute and 20 seconds to impact.

1059
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:59,300
Yes, Mr President.

1060
01:35:59,500 --> 01:36:03,500
Sir, at this point in time, we cannot
positively confirm the inbounds.

1061
01:36:03,900 --> 01:36:06,500
We have reason to believe
they may not exist.

1062
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:09,000
Yes, sir. That's affirmative.

1063
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:11,600
Yes, sir.

1064
01:36:11,900 --> 01:36:13,100
I do, too.

1065
01:36:13,300 --> 01:36:15,300
One minute to impact.

1066
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:18,100
Who's first and how soon?

1067
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:21,200
Initial impact
in the 43rd Bomb Wing at Loring,

1068
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:24,500
319th at Grand Forks,
and Alaskan Air Command, Elmendorf.

1069
01:36:24,700 --> 01:36:26,600
50 seconds to impact.

1070
01:36:26,900 --> 01:36:29,800
Get me the senior controllers.
I wanna talk to 'em myself.

1071
01:36:30,100 --> 01:36:32,100
All stations, this is Crystal Palace.

1072
01:36:32,300 --> 01:36:35,000
Stand by for a message from Brass Hat.
Acknowledge.

1073
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:38,900
ElmendorfAirForce Base Operations.
Lieutenant Colonel Bowers.

1074
01:36:39,100 --> 01:36:42,100
319th Bomb Wing Operations.
Colonel Chase.

1075
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:47,400
Colonel, this is Loring AirForce Base.
The senior controllerisn't here right now.

1076
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:49,800
That's all right. Who are you?

1077
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,600
Sir, this is Airman Dougherty, sir.

1078
01:36:53,900 --> 01:36:56,000
This is General Beringer at NORAD.

1079
01:36:56,300 --> 01:36:58,200
Our current situation...

1080
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:02,400
Men, we're currently tracking

1081
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:05,800
approximately 2,400 inbound
Soviet warheads.

1082
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,500
But at the moment
we cannot confirm this.

1083
01:37:08,700 --> 01:37:11,200
I repeat, we cannot confirm this.

1084
01:37:11,500 --> 01:37:13,300
30 seconds to impact.

1085
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:18,000
We're right there with you guys.
We've taken all the steps we can.

1086
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,500
Stand by to launch missiles
at my command.

1087
01:37:29,300 --> 01:37:31,600
Stay on this channel as long as you can.

1088
01:37:31,900 --> 01:37:33,800
We'll be standing by.

1089
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
20 seconds to impact.

1090
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,300
Ten... nine...

1091
01:37:48,700 --> 01:37:51,400
eight... seven...

1092
01:37:51,700 --> 01:37:53,000
six...

1093
01:37:53,100 --> 01:37:54,800
five...

1094
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:56,000
four...

1095
01:37:56,300 --> 01:37:57,500
three...

1096
01:37:57,700 --> 01:37:58,800
two...

1097
01:37:59,100 --> 01:38:01,100
one... Impact.

1098
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:20,500
This is Crystal Palace. Are you still on?

1099
01:38:22,600 --> 01:38:26,800
This is Crystal Palace.
Are you still on? Anyone there?

1100
01:38:27,800 --> 01:38:29,700
That's affiirmative, sir.

1101
01:38:31,100 --> 01:38:32,300
Yeah! We're here!

1102
01:38:32,600 --> 01:38:36,000
- Jesus H Christ! We're still here!
- Our boards are showing impact.

1103
01:38:37,800 --> 01:38:41,200
No, sir. No impact. We're alive and well.

1104
01:38:41,400 --> 01:38:42,800
All right!

1105
01:38:43,400 --> 01:38:44,800
All right!

1106
01:38:50,100 --> 01:38:52,100
All right!

1107
01:38:58,600 --> 01:39:00,800
All right! Recall the bombers!

1108
01:39:01,100 --> 01:39:03,100
Stand down the missiles!

1109
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:37,200
Joshua, what are you doing?

1110
01:39:40,500 --> 01:39:42,800
COC, I need Dr McKittrick right away.

1111
01:39:43,700 --> 01:39:46,100
- This is McKittrick.
- Sir, we got a problem.

1112
01:39:46,300 --> 01:39:48,400
WOPR's not letting me log back on.

1113
01:39:48,700 --> 01:39:51,900
- I can't get in to stand down the missiles.
- Stand by.

1114
01:40:04,900 --> 01:40:06,400
Paul, this is McKittrick.

1115
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:08,800
The WOPR's not letting us back in.

1116
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:12,400
I know. No one can get back on.
We're trying everything.

1117
01:40:12,700 --> 01:40:16,000
It's like the entire password file
has been wiped out.

1118
01:40:16,300 --> 01:40:19,000
I tried that! Don't you think
I would have tried that?

1119
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:24,300
What are those?

1120
01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:26,400
Those are launch codes.

1121
01:40:26,600 --> 01:40:28,500
What are they for?

1122
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:32,800
Joshua's trying to find the right codes
so he can launch the missiles himself.

1123
01:40:43,500 --> 01:40:44,500
What's happening?

1124
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:47,100
The random number generators
aren't running.

1125
01:40:47,400 --> 01:40:49,300
- Got anything?
- I'm still looking.

1126
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:52,100
I got no idea.
It could be coming from anywhere.

1127
01:40:54,200 --> 01:40:56,300
Sir, you better get on the headset.

1128
01:40:58,400 --> 01:40:59,400
Yeah?

1129
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:04,500
General, the machine has locked us out.
It's sending random numbers to the silos.

1130
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:06,700
Codes. To launch the missiles.

1131
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:08,900
Just unplug the goddamn thing!

1132
01:41:09,200 --> 01:41:12,300
- Jesus Christ!
- That won't work, General.

1133
01:41:12,500 --> 01:41:15,700
It would interpret a shutdown
as the destruction of NORAD.

1134
01:41:15,900 --> 01:41:20,500
The computers in the silos would carry
out their last instructions. They'd launch.

1135
01:41:20,900 --> 01:41:24,100
- Can't we disarm the missiles?
- Over a thousand of them?

1136
01:41:24,500 --> 01:41:28,300
There's no time. At this rate
it'll hit the launch codes in 5.3 minutes.

1137
01:41:30,600 --> 01:41:34,200
Mr McKittrick?
After very careful consideration, sir,

1138
01:41:34,600 --> 01:41:38,700
I have come to the conclusion
that your new defence system sucks.

1139
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:42,600
I don't have to take that,
you pig-eyed sack of shit.

1140
01:41:42,900 --> 01:41:47,600
I was hoping for something a little better
than that from a man of your education.

1141
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:49,900
General, it's the president.

1142
01:41:54,900 --> 01:41:57,700
What do you...
What are you gonna tell him?

1143
01:41:59,100 --> 01:42:02,100
That I'm ordering our bombers
back to fail-safe.

1144
01:42:02,300 --> 01:42:05,300
We might have to go through
this thing after all.

1145
01:42:08,200 --> 01:42:09,100
Yes, sir.

1146
01:42:16,300 --> 01:42:19,600
He's got one. When he gets all ten,
he'll launch the missiles.

1147
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:23,200
- Well, can't they get in and stop it?
- No. They can't.

1148
01:42:25,900 --> 01:42:28,700
They've taken out my password.

1149
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,700
- Well, what are we gonna do?
- I don't know. Do you?

1150
01:42:32,100 --> 01:42:35,300
I told you not to start
playing games with that thing.

1151
01:42:39,400 --> 01:42:40,600
It's games.

1152
01:42:42,600 --> 01:42:44,700
- Games!
- Try it.

1153
01:42:44,900 --> 01:42:48,400
- John, feed it a tapeworm.
- Too risky. It might smash the system.

1154
01:42:48,600 --> 01:42:51,200
- Did the kid get in the back door?
- We took it out.

1155
01:42:51,500 --> 01:42:53,800
- Invade the deep logic.
- We hit a fire wall.

1156
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:57,000
If it wants to play a game, then play it.
Have it list games.

1157
01:42:57,200 --> 01:43:00,000
- For Christ's sake!
- He's played before.

1158
01:43:00,300 --> 01:43:02,500
- He can hardly do worse.
- Two numbers.

1159
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:05,500
I'd piss on a spark plug
if I thought it'd do any good.

1160
01:43:05,700 --> 01:43:08,300
- Let the boy in there, Major.
- List games.

1161
01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:16,000
Chess.

1162
01:43:23,400 --> 01:43:24,900
Three numbers locked in.

1163
01:43:25,100 --> 01:43:26,300
Poker.

1164
01:43:29,100 --> 01:43:32,400
Security system's
not gonna let anything through.

1165
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:36,900
Global thermonuclear war.

1166
01:43:45,800 --> 01:43:47,200
Four numbers.

1167
01:43:49,700 --> 01:43:52,000
Stephen, for Christ's sake. Do something.

1168
01:43:52,200 --> 01:43:54,500
- Come on, kid. Let's go.
- No. Try again.

1169
01:43:57,700 --> 01:43:59,900
- Put the list back up.
- We already tried that.

1170
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:01,900
- Put it up!
- Yes, put it up.

1171
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,700
- It's not on the list!
- What's not on the list?

1172
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:14,800
Go ahead. It's got to be somewhere.

1173
01:44:17,800 --> 01:44:20,900
Tic-tac-toe.

1174
01:44:27,100 --> 01:44:29,800
You're in. Order it to disarm the missiles.

1175
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:31,100
No! No.

1176
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,200
Five numbers. It's got half the code.

1177
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:46,600
One.

1178
01:44:48,200 --> 01:44:50,100
- Put X in the centre square.
- I know.

1179
01:45:01,400 --> 01:45:03,600
- Six up.
- There's no way you can win.

1180
01:45:03,800 --> 01:45:06,700
I know that. It doesn't. It hasn't learned.

1181
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:11,400
- Is there any way to make it play itself?
- Yes. Number of players zero.

1182
01:45:32,500 --> 01:45:33,800
Seven!

1183
01:45:34,100 --> 01:45:36,500
Come on. Learn, goddamn it.

1184
01:45:49,500 --> 01:45:50,600
Eight.

1185
01:45:50,800 --> 01:45:55,100
It must be caught in a loop. It's taking
power from the rest of the system.

1186
01:45:56,300 --> 01:45:58,100
Nine numbers.

1187
01:46:02,200 --> 01:46:05,100
Ten! It's got the code. It's going to launch.

1188
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:26,300
Colonel Conley, call SAC.
Get me a launch status report.

1189
01:46:29,100 --> 01:46:31,000
Major Davis, get me the president.

1190
01:47:04,100 --> 01:47:05,500
How you doin', Colonel?

1191
01:47:05,700 --> 01:47:09,100
Land lines out of the mountain are dead.
I'm trying satellites.

1192
01:47:34,500 --> 01:47:37,200
- What's it doing?
- It's learning.

1193
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:27,400
Greetings, ProfessorFalken.

1194
01:48:36,500 --> 01:48:39,000
Hello, Joshua.

1195
01:48:39,900 --> 01:48:41,700
Strange game.

1196
01:48:41,900 --> 01:48:45,100
The only winning move is not to play.

1197
01:48:53,300 --> 01:48:56,400
How about a nice game ofchess?

1198
01:49:33,100 --> 01:49:36,600
Colonel Conley, take us to DEFCON 5.

1199
01:49:36,900 --> 01:49:38,900
Yes, sir.

1200
01:52:40,400 --> 01:52:42,600
