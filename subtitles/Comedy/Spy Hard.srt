1
00:00:16,227 --> 00:00:19,967
We're approaching insertion target area,
about a mile from your D.Z.

2
00:00:20,063 --> 00:00:21,885
You ready, WD-40?

3
00:00:23,515 --> 00:00:26,200
I never felt more ready
in my life.

4
00:00:28,694 --> 00:00:31,474
Oh, damn! What the hell--
Steele, are you crazy?

5
00:00:31,762 --> 00:00:35,406
Good afternoon, WD-40.

6
00:00:35,598 --> 00:00:38,570
We now begin "the free world's in
double jeopardy" round of your mission.

7
00:00:38,762 --> 00:00:41,160
- He's a sadistic criminal mastermind...

8
00:00:41,352 --> 00:00:43,845
and international arms dealer
who has brokered a deal...

9
00:00:43,941 --> 00:00:48,448
to sell a stolen Scorpion missile
to a Middle Eastern terrorist cell.

10
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,654
The question is.
Who is Rancor?

11
00:00:50,846 --> 00:00:52,956
That's right.
General Derwood Rancor.

12
00:00:53,051 --> 00:00:56,791
So why don't you begin your mission.
And good luck to you, WD-40.

13
00:00:58,325 --> 00:01:00,531
And don't forget, WD-40,
as always,

14
00:01:00,723 --> 00:01:03,983
this tape will self-destruct
in three seconds.

15
00:01:04,175 --> 00:01:08,682
Steele!

16
00:01:53,849 --> 00:01:56,534
General Rancor,
your chopper's waiting.

17
00:01:56,726 --> 00:02:00,179
Fine. Be there in a minute.
I ain't done with this one yet.

18
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,055
Talk to me, boy!

19
00:02:03,247 --> 00:02:08,042
He doesn't want to talk.
Take him outside and shoot him.

20
00:02:18,207 --> 00:02:23,002
And when you shoot him,
use the silencer.

21
00:02:39,112 --> 00:02:40,838
Thank you.
Have a nice flight.

22
00:02:43,332 --> 00:02:45,057
Have a great flight.

23
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:46,976
- Enjoy destroying the world, sir.
- Thank you, ma'am, I will.

24
00:02:49,565 --> 00:02:52,155
I'm going in there.

25
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,990
My God!
Look at you.

26
00:02:56,182 --> 00:02:59,059
- You are such an incredible man.

27
00:03:00,689 --> 00:03:04,812
It's my job, darling.
I do it for my country.

28
00:03:05,004 --> 00:03:08,649
Hmm? Oh. Good luck.

29
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,237
Luck's got nothing to do with it.

30
00:03:30,896 --> 00:03:33,773
Nothing can stop me now!

31
00:03:33,965 --> 00:03:38,472
Not even that sanctimonious
secret agent Boy Scout Dick--

32
00:03:38,664 --> 00:03:40,582
Y oo-hoo!

33
00:03:43,362 --> 00:03:45,184
Steele?

34
00:03:48,637 --> 00:03:51,322
- Oh, Dick, don't drop me!
- Hold on! Whoa! Don't!

35
00:03:51,513 --> 00:03:55,254
- Grab my wrist!
- Oh!

36
00:03:57,747 --> 00:04:02,158
Whoa!

37
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,843
- Don't drop me, Dick! Don't drop me!

38
00:04:05,035 --> 00:04:08,679
- Honey?

39
00:04:29,105 --> 00:04:33,709
A man of intrigue
He lives for the thrill

40
00:04:37,256 --> 00:04:42,338
Always has places to go
and people to kill

41
00:04:44,736 --> 00:04:47,901
Danger is the game he plays

42
00:04:48,093 --> 00:04:52,120
And he holds every card

43
00:04:52,312 --> 00:04:54,997
'Cause if you wanna win

44
00:04:55,189 --> 00:04:58,737
You gotta spy hard

45
00:05:01,422 --> 00:05:06,217
A man of the world
so suave and discreet

46
00:05:08,518 --> 00:05:13,889
He trips over the women
piled up at his feet

47
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,834
But evil's lurking

48
00:05:20,026 --> 00:05:24,437
So he's always on his guard

49
00:05:24,628 --> 00:05:27,410
'Cause if you're gonna spy

50
00:05:27,506 --> 00:05:32,685
You better spy hard

51
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:36,040
He's always there

52
00:05:36,232 --> 00:05:40,644
When the chips
are beginning to fall

53
00:05:40,836 --> 00:05:44,000
He wouldn't care

54
00:05:44,191 --> 00:05:46,589
If they kicked him
and grabbed him

55
00:05:46,781 --> 00:05:48,603
And shot him
and stabbed him

56
00:05:48,795 --> 00:05:52,343
And nailed both his ears
to the wall

57
00:05:53,973 --> 00:05:56,371
Facing death every day

58
00:05:56,563 --> 00:05:59,726
Is a tough job for any man

59
00:06:01,165 --> 00:06:04,330
But his hours are flexible

60
00:06:04,618 --> 00:06:07,686
And he's got
a great dental plan

61
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:12,865
By the way
if you walked in late

62
00:06:13,057 --> 00:06:16,700
Allow me to reiterate

63
00:06:16,892 --> 00:06:20,249
The name of this movie

64
00:06:20,441 --> 00:06:23,892
Is Spy Hard

65
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:27,920
They call it Spy Hard

66
00:06:28,112 --> 00:06:31,373
You're watching Spy Hard

67
00:06:31,661 --> 00:06:37,798
It's the theme from Spy Hard

68
00:08:01,035 --> 00:08:04,967
Sir, I hate to disturb you, but we're picking
up something interesting on the compound...

69
00:08:05,158 --> 00:08:07,460
- infrared detection system.
- Well, what is it?

70
00:08:07,652 --> 00:08:09,666
Oh, it's this really neat
security system, sir.

71
00:08:09,858 --> 00:08:13,981
- It picks up the body heat on the
intruders-- - Fine! What is it detecting?

72
00:08:14,173 --> 00:08:18,297
Oh, well, it looks like
Agent Barbara Dahl, sir.

73
00:08:24,242 --> 00:08:27,215
Barbara Dahl?

74
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:29,709
Hot damn!
At last!

75
00:08:29,901 --> 00:08:31,722
Arm me.

76
00:08:33,352 --> 00:08:36,421
Y eah.
Now, bring me the bait.

77
00:08:38,244 --> 00:08:40,065
Welcome, Miss Dahl.

78
00:08:40,161 --> 00:08:43,326
General Rancor would like to see you.
Don't even think about it!

79
00:08:43,517 --> 00:08:46,011
Put the gun down!

80
00:08:51,381 --> 00:08:55,409
Move.
Don't try anything funny.

81
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,093
Oh, you morons!

82
00:08:58,285 --> 00:09:00,875
Let go!
Oh! Oh!

83
00:09:01,162 --> 00:09:04,422
- Well, look at you.

84
00:09:04,614 --> 00:09:06,820
Barbara Dahl.

85
00:09:07,012 --> 00:09:10,177
If you ain't the spitting image
of your mama.

86
00:09:10,273 --> 00:09:15,259
Don't you talk about my mother,
you hybrid curiosity.

87
00:09:15,451 --> 00:09:17,465
My mother was twice the man you are.

88
00:09:17,656 --> 00:09:19,766
Hey, lady,
I think you're carrying...

89
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:23,314
this "spitting image" thing
a little bit too far.

90
00:09:23,602 --> 00:09:26,191
Now that I got Barbara Dahl,

91
00:09:26,383 --> 00:09:30,698
it's just a matter of time
before Dick Steele comes to get her.

92
00:09:46,329 --> 00:09:48,247
Have you confirmed
this transmission?

93
00:09:48,439 --> 00:09:51,028
I have. It's confirmed.
It's Barbara Dahl.

94
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,618
Who authorized Agent Barbara Dahl
to go on this operation anyway?

95
00:09:53,905 --> 00:09:56,398
No one.
She's working on her own.

96
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:58,316
This one is personal, Coleman.

97
00:09:58,508 --> 00:10:02,344
Well, this personal mission may have
cost a good agent her life...

98
00:10:02,536 --> 00:10:04,453
and put the entire free world
in jeopardy.

99
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:07,139
- We must inform the director.

100
00:10:07,331 --> 00:10:09,824
This is the director.
What is it, Coleman and Bishop?

101
00:10:10,112 --> 00:10:13,084
Sir, we've intercepted a very disturbing
satellite transmission...

102
00:10:13,276 --> 00:10:15,386
from our listening post
on the Rock of Gibraltar.

103
00:10:15,578 --> 00:10:17,688
- Well, what is it?
- It's this really big rock...

104
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:20,372
sticking out of the water
on the south coast of Spain.

105
00:10:24,304 --> 00:10:26,126
What is the transmission?

106
00:10:26,318 --> 00:10:29,003
You will have to see it
to believe it, sir.

107
00:10:40,798 --> 00:10:43,580
- You've got to put it on channel three.
- No, four.

108
00:10:43,771 --> 00:10:46,935
- Switch it to VHS.
- And take it off of cable.

109
00:10:47,127 --> 00:10:49,333
Put it on the monitor.

110
00:10:49,429 --> 00:10:52,498
And now this
special message from Rancor Industries.

111
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:54,799
She makes a pretty hood ornament,
don't you think?

112
00:10:54,991 --> 00:11:00,074
- Rancor!
- Y es, it is I, good ol' General Rancor.

113
00:11:00,265 --> 00:11:03,333
I'm back, big as life
and twice as ugly.

114
00:11:03,525 --> 00:11:06,019
- But Steele blew him up!
- Apparently not.

115
00:11:06,211 --> 00:11:08,704
You did everything
except eat me,

116
00:11:08,896 --> 00:11:10,621
and I'm still alive.

117
00:11:10,813 --> 00:11:13,307
All Steele did was blow off
a couple of arms.

118
00:11:13,499 --> 00:11:15,417
That's no biggie,
no big thing.

119
00:11:15,609 --> 00:11:17,335
Now I got plenty of arms!

120
00:11:17,527 --> 00:11:21,842
Big arms. Pretty arms. something.

121
00:11:25,966 --> 00:11:29,034
Your pretty little agent
is now part...

122
00:11:29,226 --> 00:11:31,527
of the nose cone
on top of my missile.

123
00:11:31,719 --> 00:11:35,938
This missile will be launched
in 36 hours...

124
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,911
- and nothing will stop me!
- He's a madman!

125
00:11:39,007 --> 00:11:42,172
Only thing is,
I'm missing one little chip...

126
00:11:42,364 --> 00:11:46,103
that controls my satellite,
and, daggone, I want it back!

127
00:11:46,391 --> 00:11:49,652
Now you hand me my chip,
and I'll give you back your agent.

128
00:11:49,844 --> 00:11:53,199
Good God.
He must be stopped!

129
00:11:53,391 --> 00:11:56,268
Dick Steele couldn't
stop me 15 years ago,

130
00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:00,776
and all the dicks you've got
won't stop me now!

131
00:12:00,968 --> 00:12:02,789
Apparently,
he hasn't seen the size...

132
00:12:02,885 --> 00:12:04,803
of some of our newer members!

133
00:12:04,995 --> 00:12:07,776
- With the chip, he rules the world.

134
00:12:07,968 --> 00:12:11,803
- Without the chip,
he destroys the world and--

135
00:12:11,995 --> 00:12:15,448
- Would you practice someplace else?
I'm trying to think!

136
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:19,667
- The world? Ha!

137
00:12:19,859 --> 00:12:22,065
We all know what
General Rancor really wants.

138
00:12:22,256 --> 00:12:24,462
- Steele. - That's right!

139
00:12:24,654 --> 00:12:27,722
- And we're going to give Steele to him.
- Steele?

140
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:32,134
Have you forgotten what happened the last
time Steele was placed in the line of fire?

141
00:12:47,861 --> 00:12:51,121
We are stopping here. Traveller wants
to mingle with the crowd.

142
00:13:16,438 --> 00:13:20,082
- Oh! Oh, my God!
- Steele, what the hell are you doing? Get off me!

143
00:13:20,273 --> 00:13:23,246
- Get him in there!
Get him in the limo! Cover him!

144
00:13:23,438 --> 00:13:27,274
Go, go, go! Go! Go, go!

145
00:13:33,124 --> 00:13:35,521
The bridge is out.

146
00:13:35,712 --> 00:13:38,494
Do not enter.
The bridge is out.

147
00:13:38,686 --> 00:13:42,330
The bridge is out,
damn it! Stop this car!

148
00:14:10,523 --> 00:14:12,825
- Stay away from the window, sir.

149
00:14:13,016 --> 00:14:15,318
Steele, do something!

150
00:14:33,346 --> 00:14:34,880
Good job, Steele!
Thanks!

151
00:14:35,072 --> 00:14:38,045
- It's about time
that jerk did something right.

152
00:14:38,237 --> 00:14:41,018
- Hang on, Mr. President!

153
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:52,813
The bridge is out. Do not enter.

154
00:14:54,252 --> 00:14:58,662
Thank God our president
was one hell of a good swimmer.

155
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:03,458
Nonetheless... there's only
one man for this operation.

156
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:05,855
Agent WD-40.
Steele.

157
00:15:05,951 --> 00:15:07,964
Dick Steele.

158
00:15:08,156 --> 00:15:12,376
Dick, Dick, Dick Steele.

159
00:15:12,568 --> 00:15:14,870
Dick.

160
00:15:15,062 --> 00:15:19,376
Oh, Dick, that was incredible.

161
00:15:19,568 --> 00:15:21,486
- Thank you.

162
00:15:21,678 --> 00:15:23,596
Don't thank me, darling.

163
00:15:23,788 --> 00:15:27,432
The art of lovemaking takes two.

164
00:15:27,623 --> 00:15:31,843
Sometimes three or four, depending on
how well you do at the crap tables.

165
00:15:32,035 --> 00:15:33,473
- Fore!
- Well, my putter's up.

166
00:15:33,569 --> 00:15:35,679
- Fore!
- Well, my putter's up.

167
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:38,556
Oh, Dick, I'm exhausted.

168
00:15:38,748 --> 00:15:43,542
- You are insatiable.
- Fifteen minutes to tee- off time.

169
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:47,378
I think there's something you and I
should talk about openly and honestly...

170
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:49,679
before I head off
to my golf game.

171
00:15:49,871 --> 00:15:53,036
- What is it, Dick?
- It's a game.

172
00:15:53,132 --> 00:15:56,009
People dress funny.
Hit a little ball with clubs.

173
00:15:56,201 --> 00:15:58,118
Drinking is involved.

174
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:00,228
Is something wrong, Dick?

175
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,626
Whatever we've had between us,

176
00:16:02,722 --> 00:16:05,503
I think it's only fair that you know
my heart still belongs...

177
00:16:05,695 --> 00:16:08,187
to the girl I fell
in love with years ago.

178
00:16:08,379 --> 00:16:10,585
Victoria.
She fell off a cliff.

179
00:16:10,777 --> 00:16:13,462
- She died.
- Yes, I know.

180
00:16:13,654 --> 00:16:15,571
I was just getting to that.

181
00:16:15,763 --> 00:16:18,640
But after Victoria Dahl,
well, I don't think...

182
00:16:18,832 --> 00:16:21,517
I'll ever find room
for another woman in this...

183
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:24,585
ripped-apart, torn-up,
scarred, burned-out...

184
00:16:24,777 --> 00:16:27,079
Iump in my chest...

185
00:16:27,271 --> 00:16:29,956
where a human heart once beat.

186
00:16:30,148 --> 00:16:33,216
I hope you understand
what I'm trying to say to you.

187
00:16:33,408 --> 00:16:36,285
Oh, I'll live, Mr. Steele.

188
00:16:36,477 --> 00:16:40,216
It's your life
I'm worried about.

189
00:16:40,408 --> 00:16:42,710
I'm glad you understand.

190
00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:46,834
- I know how much these things can hurt.

191
00:16:47,026 --> 00:16:48,751
Mr. Steele.

192
00:16:48,943 --> 00:16:51,245
[ Woman ] Hi, Dick.

193
00:16:55,656 --> 00:16:57,382
- Hi, Mr. Steele!
- Good morning, Mrs. Hudmucker.

194
00:16:57,574 --> 00:17:00,259
Fore!
- Watch out.

195
00:17:04,479 --> 00:17:06,780
- You all right?
- Thank you.

196
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:09,657
A little help, please? Thank you.

197
00:17:12,246 --> 00:17:16,753
Dinatelli foursome
to starter's window. Mr. Jack Dinatelli.

198
00:17:16,945 --> 00:17:20,302
- Duck!

199
00:17:24,904 --> 00:17:27,398
- Dick, wait!

200
00:17:27,494 --> 00:17:31,713
Well, Steve!

201
00:17:31,904 --> 00:17:35,549
- Steve Bishop. You look great.
- Thank you. We go back a long way, huh?

202
00:17:35,741 --> 00:17:37,083
Yeah.

203
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:40,919
- Let's have a drink.
- Okay.

204
00:17:41,111 --> 00:17:43,029
Just sit right there, Steve.

205
00:17:43,221 --> 00:17:46,002
- The usual, Mr. Steele?
- You betcha.

206
00:17:46,194 --> 00:17:48,303
- Well, how's everything at the agency?
- Ah, Dick...

207
00:17:48,494 --> 00:17:51,564
it used to be such fun
killin' a few spies...

208
00:17:51,659 --> 00:17:54,153
with gas from a banana grenade.

209
00:17:54,345 --> 00:17:57,509
But now, huh, it's all
bureaucratic politics.

210
00:17:57,605 --> 00:18:00,386
You gotta fill out 20 forms
in triplicate...

211
00:18:00,482 --> 00:18:02,400
just to take a piss!

212
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:20,620
- Boy, that was fun.

213
00:18:20,716 --> 00:18:23,784
- Y eah.
- Thank you!

214
00:18:23,976 --> 00:18:26,182
Oh, man, they don't do stuff
like that at the agency any more.

215
00:18:26,374 --> 00:18:28,292
I'm sorry to hear that, Steve.

216
00:18:28,484 --> 00:18:30,785
- Uh, Dickie... there is something.
- Relax, sugar.

217
00:18:30,881 --> 00:18:33,086
Steve, I'm out of the Service.

218
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,868
There's a plot
to launch a satellite.

219
00:18:35,964 --> 00:18:39,799
- Now, I'm out of the Service.
Talk about something else.

220
00:18:39,991 --> 00:18:42,293
- Bishop.
- Bishop here.

221
00:18:42,388 --> 00:18:44,307
- Got a new lead. Gonna need you here.
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

222
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,225
- And get a dozen eggs and a gallon of milk.
- Okay.

223
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:48,142
- I'll leave right away.
- Thank you, sir.

224
00:18:48,334 --> 00:18:50,348
- No more headsets.

225
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,458
Ear buttons. They put the receiver
right in your head now.

226
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:55,526
- I gotta get back to the hotel.

227
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:58,595
- The director wants you to see this.
- I'm not interested, Steve.

228
00:18:58,787 --> 00:19:01,280
Please, Dickie.
Take a look at the tape.

229
00:19:01,376 --> 00:19:01,472
Please, Dickie.
Take a look at the tape.

230
00:19:01,472 --> 00:19:03,198
It'll change your mind.

231
00:19:18,446 --> 00:19:20,746
Hmm-hmm.

232
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:34,748
She makes a pretty hood ornament,
don't you think?

233
00:19:35,036 --> 00:19:39,926
[ Chuckles ] Yes, it is I,
good ol' General Rancor.

234
00:19:40,118 --> 00:19:44,625
I'm back, big as life
and twice as ugly.

235
00:19:47,885 --> 00:19:50,187
- All Steele did was blow off a couple of arms.
- Rancor!

236
00:19:50,379 --> 00:19:54,214
- That's no biggie, no big thing. Now I got plenty of arms.
- He can't be alive.

237
00:19:54,406 --> 00:19:57,379
- Your pretty Barbara Dahl--
- My God!

238
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,777
Barbara Dahl.

239
00:20:02,845 --> 00:20:06,873
Victoria... why would your daughter
join the agency...

240
00:20:07,065 --> 00:20:09,079
knowing what happened to you?

241
00:20:09,271 --> 00:20:10,900
Why?

242
00:20:12,243 --> 00:20:13,969
Why?

243
00:20:14,257 --> 00:20:16,654
Why, why, why, why?

244
00:20:16,846 --> 00:20:22,216
Victoria Dahl...
you were the only woman I ever loved.

245
00:20:22,408 --> 00:20:26,340
Raindrops keep fallin' on my head

246
00:20:26,532 --> 00:20:31,806
And just like the guy
whose feet are too big for his bed

247
00:20:31,998 --> 00:20:34,683
- Nothin' seems to fit

248
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:39,861
Those raindrops are fallin' on my head
They keep fallin'

249
00:20:40,053 --> 00:20:45,423
So I just did me
some talkin' to the sun

250
00:20:45,615 --> 00:20:50,985
And I said I didn't like
the way he got things done

251
00:20:51,273 --> 00:20:53,670
Sleepin' on the job

252
00:20:53,862 --> 00:20:57,602
- Those raindrops are fallin'
on my head

253
00:20:57,698 --> 00:21:02,205
They keep fallin'
But there's one thing

254
00:21:02,396 --> 00:21:04,314
I know

255
00:21:04,506 --> 00:21:08,055
The blues they sent to meet me

256
00:21:08,247 --> 00:21:10,931
Won't defeat me

257
00:21:11,123 --> 00:21:14,959
It won't be long 'til happiness

258
00:21:15,151 --> 00:21:17,261
Steps up to greet me

259
00:21:24,261 --> 00:21:26,179
Raindrops keep fallin' on my head

260
00:21:26,371 --> 00:21:30,015
But that doesn't mean my eyes
will soon be turnin' red

261
00:21:30,207 --> 00:21:33,563
For today's top story,
we now join Kelly Lange live downtown.

262
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:36,056
Kelly Lange here
for Channel 3 lsland News.

263
00:21:36,248 --> 00:21:40,564
A tragic accident has claimed the life of
a businessman identified as Steven Bishop,

264
00:21:40,755 --> 00:21:45,550
when a huge grand piano fell from
the 17th floor of the Mayan Hotel...

265
00:21:45,646 --> 00:21:45,742
when a huge grand piano fell from
the 17th floor of the Mayan Hotel...

266
00:21:45,742 --> 00:21:47,947
directly behind me
and landed on his car.

267
00:21:48,043 --> 00:21:49,866
- An accident?
- It seems the man was--

268
00:21:49,961 --> 00:21:52,071
- Having a kid at 60, that's an accident.

269
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:55,619
Having a piano fall on you,
that's... bad luck.

270
00:21:55,715 --> 00:21:59,263
We're told that they had to remove the
driver's body from the oil pan of the car.

271
00:21:59,455 --> 00:22:01,660
- Police are ruling this as an accident.
- Operator.

272
00:22:01,852 --> 00:22:04,058
Operator, get me Washington.

273
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,072
- George?
- D.C.

274
00:22:11,442 --> 00:22:14,415
I'll take care of
the luggage, just some overnight things.

275
00:22:27,264 --> 00:22:29,950
- Bonjour, monsieur.
- ...no parking.

276
00:22:30,142 --> 00:22:33,211
Do not leave
your baggage unattended.

277
00:22:33,403 --> 00:22:36,279
It looks like
you could use a hand.

278
00:22:39,348 --> 00:22:42,991
I'm afraid I'm pretty clumsy.

279
00:22:43,183 --> 00:22:46,923
- You must be headed to Los Angeles.
- How do you know that?

280
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:51,430
- It's written on your ticket.
- Oh! Thank you.

281
00:22:51,526 --> 00:22:53,732
You are welcome.

282
00:22:53,924 --> 00:22:56,130
Have a nice flight,
and I wish you adieu.

283
00:22:56,321 --> 00:22:59,678
Oh, thank you, but I'm quite satisfied
with the 'do I have.

284
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:10,034
If you want to see me again,
turn around now.

285
00:23:19,624 --> 00:23:21,926
Aha.

286
00:23:31,611 --> 00:23:33,624
[ Flight Attendant ]
It's right here on the aisle.

287
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,653
[ Man ] No, no, no.
I asked for a window seat.

288
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:41,009
I can't be getting up and down just because
somebody wants to be getting in and out.

289
00:23:41,105 --> 00:23:45,228
- I have too much to do. I always have a window seat.
- Excuse me, sir.

290
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:49,256
- I was wondering, do you mind?
- No problem. Please, be my guest.

291
00:23:49,448 --> 00:23:52,037
- Actually, I prefer an aisle seat.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

292
00:23:52,228 --> 00:23:55,297
- Be my guest. Here.
- Here, let me help you with these.

293
00:23:55,489 --> 00:23:59,996
I hope that this will be the last
of the conversations on this trip.

294
00:24:00,092 --> 00:24:01,530
Your ticket.

295
00:24:09,106 --> 00:24:10,928
Take it easy
with that luggage!

296
00:24:13,422 --> 00:24:16,778
Excuse me, sir. Could you put your
tray table up for takeoff, please?

297
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:20,614
No, the tray table stays down, please.
Thank you very much.

298
00:24:20,806 --> 00:24:23,875
You've made things
inconvenient enough as it is.

299
00:24:23,971 --> 00:24:26,176
- What-- What is this?

300
00:24:26,367 --> 00:24:28,190
Is this yours?
Do you mind?

301
00:24:28,382 --> 00:24:31,738
- It's my briefcase.
Let me make more room for you.

302
00:24:37,779 --> 00:24:41,423
Excuse me. Is this seat taken?

303
00:24:41,615 --> 00:24:43,341
Please.

304
00:24:43,533 --> 00:24:45,259
Thank you.

305
00:24:48,808 --> 00:24:53,123
Do you always take matters
into your own hands?

306
00:24:53,219 --> 00:24:56,479
Things often end up
in my hands.

307
00:24:56,671 --> 00:24:59,164
And I bet your hands
end up in a lot of things.

308
00:24:59,356 --> 00:25:01,082
Let's just say,
my hands and things...

309
00:25:01,274 --> 00:25:03,480
are often in the same place
at the same time.

310
00:25:05,014 --> 00:25:06,835
Could I get you
something to drink?

311
00:25:07,027 --> 00:25:11,343
We'll have dry Minoli and Russos,
on the rocks,

312
00:25:11,535 --> 00:25:13,261
stirred, not beaten,
twist of lemon,

313
00:25:13,453 --> 00:25:15,658
in chilled glasses,
not frozen.

314
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:18,343
And two of those
curly little straws.

315
00:25:52,674 --> 00:25:55,072
Thirty hours, 11 minutes and 10 seconds.

316
00:25:55,264 --> 00:25:57,660
Thirty hours, 11 minutes
and 8 seconds.

317
00:25:57,852 --> 00:25:59,770
Thirty hours, 11 minutes
and 5 seconds.

318
00:26:04,182 --> 00:26:07,442
[ Director Over Intercom ] Miss Cheevus,
when Agent Steele arrives, send him right in.

319
00:26:07,634 --> 00:26:09,360
Mm-hmm.

320
00:26:16,456 --> 00:26:20,484
- Miss Cheevus, is the director available?
- No, he's married.

321
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:24,320
- Oh, you kidder.

322
00:26:24,511 --> 00:26:29,403
Miss Cheevus, you wouldn't be trying
to make things hard for me?

323
00:26:29,595 --> 00:26:32,567
Oh, Dick, if only I could.

324
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:36,787
But you know you and I would work
so well together deep undercover.

325
00:26:36,978 --> 00:26:42,061
You know the agency's rules
about secrecy. They're very... rigid.

326
00:26:42,252 --> 00:26:46,185
- Yes, and we wouldn't want
to blow it, would we?

327
00:26:46,376 --> 00:26:48,294
Why don't you two just get a motel room?

328
00:26:48,581 --> 00:26:50,979
I need you in here now, Steele!

329
00:27:20,324 --> 00:27:24,543
Miss Cheevus, wasn't the director
in the office here?

330
00:27:24,734 --> 00:27:28,379
[ Miss Cheevus Over Intercom ] He just buzzed me from in there, my little pumpy
- whumpy.

331
00:27:28,571 --> 00:27:30,488
I'll just sit down
and wait for him.

332
00:27:48,996 --> 00:27:52,736
Great Scott!
Steele, see a doctor!

333
00:27:52,928 --> 00:27:56,572
Good show, Steele.

334
00:27:56,763 --> 00:28:00,600
I hid for two weeks from
my ex-wife's attorney in this outfit.

335
00:28:00,792 --> 00:28:02,997
It's good to see you, WD-40.

336
00:28:03,093 --> 00:28:05,010
You're always
my most noble warrior.

337
00:28:05,202 --> 00:28:07,408
- Glad to find you, sir.
- Yes, yes, well,

338
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,189
we have to find someone else
far more important now.

339
00:28:10,381 --> 00:28:13,833
- You saw the tape with Rancor?
- I can't believe he's alive.

340
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:16,231
He's a madman.
He wants the world.

341
00:28:16,422 --> 00:28:19,587
But I'll be perfectly frank, Dick.
He wants you first.

342
00:28:19,875 --> 00:28:23,423
He knew I'd send you the tape,
especially with Barbara Dahl on it.

343
00:28:25,053 --> 00:28:27,163
Barbara Dahl.

344
00:28:27,355 --> 00:28:30,039
Looks just like Victoria
when she was alive.

345
00:28:30,135 --> 00:28:32,149
We don't have time
for flashbacks.

346
00:28:32,341 --> 00:28:35,602
Rancor wants the world.
Fortunately, he wants to kill you first.

347
00:28:35,794 --> 00:28:39,629
That may give us needed time. Barbara Dahl's
last transmission was from Los Angeles.

348
00:28:39,821 --> 00:28:42,219
We couldn't hold the trace
long enough to pinpoint her.

349
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:46,821
Find her, you find him,
you find the rocket.

350
00:28:47,013 --> 00:28:49,507
For the rest of it,
your guess is as good as mine.

351
00:28:49,698 --> 00:28:53,151
- Miss Cheevus, tell Noggin we're coming.

352
00:28:53,535 --> 00:28:55,260
- Hello, Noggin.
- Steele.

353
00:28:55,452 --> 00:28:58,904
Good to see you again. Do you have
a refill of that deathray laser watch?

354
00:28:59,096 --> 00:29:00,823
- Ah, a new air freshener?
- Careful!

355
00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:02,165
- Ah, a new air freshener?
- Careful!

356
00:29:02,357 --> 00:29:04,274
Whoo-hoo
Oooh

357
00:29:04,466 --> 00:29:07,056
Not again. Oh!

358
00:29:07,247 --> 00:29:09,645
Give me!

359
00:29:09,837 --> 00:29:11,754
Well, this looks like
a clever contraption.

360
00:29:11,946 --> 00:29:14,919
A mini--
A mini mobile crime lab?

361
00:29:15,111 --> 00:29:17,413
- It's a briefcase.
- I know. What does it do?

362
00:29:17,509 --> 00:29:20,960
It holds important papers,
files, pens and a calculator.

363
00:29:21,056 --> 00:29:23,454
I understand. But these numbers here,
are they in a certain sequence?

364
00:29:23,646 --> 00:29:25,851
The briefcase
is timed to explode?

365
00:29:26,043 --> 00:29:29,303
No, it's a lock so people other
than myself can't open my briefcase.

366
00:29:29,495 --> 00:29:32,468
Very complex
contemporary technology.

367
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:36,783
All right, Steele, this is your standard,
state-of-the- art field kit with three additions.

368
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:41,003
This is our latest development:
microchip Z-ray lenses,

369
00:29:41,195 --> 00:29:43,113
capable of penetrating
a layer of clothing.

370
00:29:43,401 --> 00:29:45,605
You'll be able to see if
an enemy is carrying a weapon.

371
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:47,140
Oh. Director?

372
00:29:47,332 --> 00:29:51,743
Oh, now, Steele...
should you find your hands bound,

373
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:57,017
what you can do is just reach down
and pull this pin with your teeth.

374
00:29:59,703 --> 00:30:03,346
Put the tube in your mouth, and squeeze
and it will emit a laser beam...

375
00:30:03,538 --> 00:30:06,319
powerful enough to cut steel.

376
00:30:06,415 --> 00:30:08,238
Fire in the hole, Director.

377
00:30:08,429 --> 00:30:10,922
- Huh? Oh.
- Thank you.

378
00:30:15,238 --> 00:30:17,060
Oh, and one more thing.

379
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:19,073
This micro-detonator
has a built- in timer...

380
00:30:19,265 --> 00:30:21,567
set to explode 30 seconds
after you plant it.

381
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:24,156
It has enough power
to blow up a two-story building,

382
00:30:24,348 --> 00:30:26,074
- so be careful.
- Fantastic.

383
00:30:26,266 --> 00:30:28,279
All right.
Well, here we go and, uh--

384
00:30:28,375 --> 00:30:31,444
- Oh, the glasses.
- Yeah. Thank you.

385
00:30:31,636 --> 00:30:33,458
Good to see you again, Noggin.

386
00:30:44,294 --> 00:30:46,500
Bienvenidos a Los Angeles.

387
00:30:46,691 --> 00:30:48,706
Welcome to Los Angeles.

388
00:30:48,897 --> 00:30:50,815
Ciudad de los angeles.

389
00:30:51,007 --> 00:30:53,020
City of the angels.

390
00:30:53,212 --> 00:30:55,130
?Dónde esta Maria?

391
00:30:55,322 --> 00:30:57,048
Where is Maria?

392
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,734
Maria esta en la biblioteca.

393
00:30:59,926 --> 00:31:01,651
Maria is in the library.

394
00:31:01,843 --> 00:31:04,912
- Do you have a lighter?
- I use matches.

395
00:31:05,104 --> 00:31:07,597
Does your mother know you smoke?

396
00:31:07,693 --> 00:31:07,789
Does your mother know you smoke?

397
00:31:07,789 --> 00:31:10,378
Y es, but I don't inhale.

398
00:31:10,569 --> 00:31:13,926
- Kabul.
- Uh...

399
00:31:14,118 --> 00:31:16,707
I'm Kabul.
Agent WD-40?

400
00:31:16,899 --> 00:31:18,912
Get in, get in.

401
00:31:19,104 --> 00:31:21,022
In the car.

402
00:31:24,475 --> 00:31:27,159
Hello. Excuse me. Ha!

403
00:31:27,351 --> 00:31:30,324
Our operatives believe
you may already be in grave danger.

404
00:31:30,516 --> 00:31:34,065
Please take a look at this,
Mr. Steele.

405
00:31:34,257 --> 00:31:36,270
In that file is a photo
of Desiree More.

406
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:40,681
She's an expert trained in karate, kung
fu and is a crack shot. Be on your guard.

407
00:31:40,777 --> 00:31:43,270
Rancor may have sent her
to take you out.

408
00:31:43,462 --> 00:31:46,243
She likes easy-listening
and guys who share their feelings.

409
00:31:46,435 --> 00:31:51,038
Her measurements: 36-24-36-22.

410
00:31:52,668 --> 00:31:55,641
Aye, and for God sakes,
be careful, WD-40.

411
00:31:55,833 --> 00:31:59,189
One time I got two cousins that got
salmonella poisoning in this hotel.

412
00:32:19,135 --> 00:32:22,396
Ah, sure looked like her.

413
00:32:22,588 --> 00:32:25,464
But you can't be too sure.

414
00:32:25,656 --> 00:32:28,341
Y eah, almost positive.

415
00:32:28,533 --> 00:32:30,260
Mm-hmm.

416
00:32:31,602 --> 00:32:33,329
Drink?

417
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,013
- Only when I'm thirsty.
- Tap water okay?

418
00:32:36,205 --> 00:32:38,507
Poured, not decantered.

419
00:32:38,698 --> 00:32:40,329
Sometimes you see a woman you'd...

420
00:32:40,521 --> 00:32:42,246
just love to have kill ya.

421
00:32:42,438 --> 00:32:45,795
But timing is everything,
so that was not going to be today.

422
00:32:45,986 --> 00:32:48,000
Says who?

423
00:32:48,288 --> 00:32:50,877
She's pretty smart.
I decided to play it casual.

424
00:32:51,164 --> 00:32:53,850
Casual is overrated.

425
00:32:57,015 --> 00:32:58,837
Oops.

426
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:09,193
I think the game is over,
Mr. Steele.

427
00:33:09,385 --> 00:33:11,687
You're gonna look like Swiss cheese
when they find you.

428
00:33:11,974 --> 00:33:15,811
Oh. That's no Gouda.

429
00:33:48,607 --> 00:33:51,195
"Coca Cabana."

430
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:59,538
- I'll be back for you.
- Where are you going?

431
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:01,744
In my country we have a saying:

432
00:34:01,936 --> 00:34:04,142
"A man who rides a camel is rich,

433
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:07,210
but a man who drives a Ferrari
can get lucky.

434
00:34:09,991 --> 00:34:13,732
- Oh, gee, I am so sorry.

435
00:34:13,923 --> 00:34:15,649
- What's your phone number?
- Loser.

436
00:34:15,841 --> 00:34:17,759
Oh, thank you.

437
00:34:17,951 --> 00:34:20,348
Oh, like, look at what you've done.

438
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,842
End of the line, pal.

439
00:34:23,034 --> 00:34:24,759
Uh...

440
00:34:39,336 --> 00:34:41,829
Hey, goombah!

441
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:44,226
Huh?

442
00:34:49,788 --> 00:34:52,281
Well, well, if it isn't Agent Steele.

443
00:34:53,816 --> 00:34:57,364
Excuse me.
Uh, do you have a light?

444
00:34:59,953 --> 00:35:03,022
Y eah, sure.
I got a light.

445
00:35:06,282 --> 00:35:09,255
Ow. Ow. Ow.

446
00:35:18,557 --> 00:35:20,379
Very good.

447
00:35:20,571 --> 00:35:22,968
Well, remind me never
to light your cigarette.

448
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,270
You don't lose guys
like that for long.

449
00:35:25,366 --> 00:35:27,380
Let's get the bus.
We'll be safe there.

450
00:35:29,969 --> 00:35:32,558
- Transfer? Uh, no, thank you.

451
00:35:35,339 --> 00:35:38,504
Mmm, nice dress.

452
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:44,545
Next stop:

453
00:35:44,737 --> 00:35:46,847
Sunset Boulevard.

454
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:50,203
I guess it's Sunset Boulevard.

455
00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:00,368
Pop quiz, hotshot.

456
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,382
Someone on the bus
without a transfer.

457
00:36:02,574 --> 00:36:06,793
He won't pay the fare.
What do you do? What do you do?

458
00:36:06,984 --> 00:36:08,711
Stop the bus
and let him off?

459
00:36:08,902 --> 00:36:12,931
Negatory, honcho,
because he cut the brake line.

460
00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:29,041
Excusez-moi, monsieur.

461
00:37:33,483 --> 00:37:35,113
That was nice. Nicely done.

462
00:37:35,209 --> 00:37:36,552
That was nice. Nicely done.

463
00:37:36,744 --> 00:37:38,661
Thank you. Thank you.

464
00:37:38,853 --> 00:37:41,826
Next stop: Melrose. I think.

465
00:37:42,114 --> 00:37:45,183
Well, you must be "fameeshed."
Let's mangez.

466
00:37:45,374 --> 00:37:47,675
That sounds good,
but I'm hungry.

467
00:37:47,867 --> 00:37:49,593
Let's eat first.

468
00:37:52,662 --> 00:37:55,443
- Here you go.
You both enjoy yourselves.

469
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:59,183
- Brian will be right here
to take your drink order.

470
00:37:59,375 --> 00:38:02,348
We shared an airplane, a drink.

471
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:05,512
We've been chased,
bussed, seated, but...

472
00:38:05,704 --> 00:38:08,677
I still don't really know you.

473
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:12,416
I'm Bud Fudlacker.
I have a small mail- order business.

474
00:38:12,608 --> 00:38:14,718
I travel with
the American Gladiators,

475
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:17,403
I'm 55, I like small appliances...

476
00:38:17,499 --> 00:38:19,322
and I do tax accounting
on the side.

477
00:38:19,513 --> 00:38:22,581
Let me guess.
You are Dick Steele,

478
00:38:22,773 --> 00:38:26,034
Agent WD-40
with the Secret Service.

479
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:29,774
You are 52,
you like big screen TVs...

480
00:38:29,965 --> 00:38:32,267
and you want to stop
General Rancor.

481
00:38:32,459 --> 00:38:35,144
That could describe
a thousand guys.

482
00:38:35,336 --> 00:38:37,062
Tell me about you.

483
00:38:37,253 --> 00:38:40,994
I like loose-fitting clothes,
and I drive a '69 Pinto.

484
00:38:41,186 --> 00:38:44,446
[ Chuckles ] Hi, I'm Brian.
May I take your drink orders, please?

485
00:38:44,638 --> 00:38:47,898
- I'll have--
- A dry Minoli and Russo on the rocks.

486
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:50,392
Stirred, not beaten.

487
00:38:50,583 --> 00:38:54,227
With a twist.
In a chilled glass, not frozen.

488
00:38:54,419 --> 00:38:57,680
With two of those
curly little straws.

489
00:38:57,871 --> 00:38:59,502
Be right back.

490
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:03,817
Tell me, who are you?

491
00:39:04,104 --> 00:39:07,365
Why don't you use your...

492
00:39:07,557 --> 00:39:10,721
Iegendary skills, and guess?

493
00:39:10,913 --> 00:39:14,941
You carry a UB-21 Schnauzer
with a Gnab silencer. That's K.G.B.

494
00:39:15,133 --> 00:39:18,106
You prefer an H&K over an A.K.
Your surveillance technique is N.S.A.

495
00:39:18,298 --> 00:39:21,078
Your I.D. is C.I.A.
You received your Ph.D. at NYU.

496
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:25,873
Traded in your G.T.O. for a B.M.W.
You listen to CDs by R.E.M. and S.T.P.

497
00:39:26,065 --> 00:39:29,901
And you'd like to see J.F.K.
in his B.V.D.s, getting down with O.P.P.

498
00:39:30,092 --> 00:39:34,216
And you probably put the toilet paper back
on the roll with the paper on the inside.

499
00:39:34,408 --> 00:39:36,229
Hmm.

500
00:39:36,421 --> 00:39:40,066
Here's to your remarkable
powers of observation, Mr. Steele.

501
00:39:40,258 --> 00:39:44,860
I am Agent 3.14,
Veronique Ukrinsky.

502
00:39:45,052 --> 00:39:46,778
My father is the professor.

503
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:50,902
Oh, yes, I know.
The megachip.

504
00:39:51,094 --> 00:39:54,354
When he found out he was making the chip
for Rancor, and not for the U.S.,

505
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:56,752
he escaped with it,
and he is in hiding.

506
00:39:56,943 --> 00:39:58,766
In hiding?
Where?

507
00:39:58,957 --> 00:40:00,876
He would not take the chance
in telling me where he was headed,

508
00:40:01,067 --> 00:40:04,615
but he said,
"The pendant--

509
00:40:04,807 --> 00:40:10,177
Follow the path
of your pendant to find me."

510
00:40:10,368 --> 00:40:14,588
Hmm... haven't seen
too many like these.

511
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,507
- Pendant.
- Pendant.

512
00:40:16,698 --> 00:40:18,232
- Pendant.
- Pendant.

513
00:40:18,424 --> 00:40:21,685
- Pendant.
- We don't have much time, WD-40.

514
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:24,178
Sooner or later,
Rancor will find him.

515
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:28,397
- I'll order our food to go.
- Oh, Dick, I am so worried about my father.

516
00:40:28,589 --> 00:40:31,658
What shall we do, huh?
What shall we do?

517
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:38,370
It was a teenage wedding
and the old folks wished them well

518
00:40:38,562 --> 00:40:43,454
You could see that Pierre
did truly love the mademoiselle

519
00:40:45,658 --> 00:40:51,125
And now the young monsieur
and madame have rung the chapel bell

520
00:40:51,221 --> 00:40:53,042
"C'est la vie"
said the old folks

521
00:40:53,234 --> 00:40:55,824
It goes to show
you never can tell

522
00:41:04,838 --> 00:41:06,852
Excuse me. Do you have reser.

523
00:41:07,044 --> 00:41:10,208
- Steele's here somewhere.

524
00:41:10,304 --> 00:41:13,852
Rancor wants him dead.
Find him.

525
00:41:16,825 --> 00:41:18,742
- Dance time is over.
Cigarettes? Cigars?

526
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:20,757
- There he goes. Kill him!
- Throwing knife?

527
00:41:20,948 --> 00:41:23,826
Cigarettes? Cigars?
Throwing knife?

528
00:41:24,017 --> 00:41:25,456
Thanks.

529
00:41:25,648 --> 00:41:28,044
Cigarettes?
Cigars?

530
00:41:28,236 --> 00:41:31,881
- Whoops.

531
00:41:32,169 --> 00:41:33,895
Why?

532
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,526
Quick. Get this
up against the door.

533
00:41:49,909 --> 00:41:52,018
I got an idea.

534
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:54,224
This is a picture
of my father.

535
00:41:54,416 --> 00:41:57,389
If we get separated,
find him, save him.

536
00:41:59,882 --> 00:42:01,896
Why?

537
00:42:02,088 --> 00:42:06,020
- Go! Go, go, go!

538
00:42:06,212 --> 00:42:09,663
- Oh, shut up!
- Ow! I came here to dance!

539
00:42:09,855 --> 00:42:12,732
- Ow! Dick, help me!

540
00:42:12,924 --> 00:42:14,555
- I'll kill you!

541
00:42:14,746 --> 00:42:17,335
- Get in this--
- No, let me go!

542
00:42:30,665 --> 00:42:35,076
- Okay, let's go!
- Dick, help me!

543
00:42:41,502 --> 00:42:44,570
Follow the path
of your pendant to find me."

544
00:42:44,761 --> 00:42:47,735
- What is that?
- It's her pendant.

545
00:42:47,926 --> 00:42:49,940
"Follow the path
of the pendant to find me."

546
00:42:50,131 --> 00:42:52,433
Have you ever seen
anything like that?

547
00:42:52,529 --> 00:42:56,269
- Ah!
- What? What?

548
00:42:56,461 --> 00:42:58,475
No.

549
00:42:58,666 --> 00:43:01,160
Any idea where it came from?

550
00:43:01,351 --> 00:43:04,516
- Museum of Natural History.
- How do you know that?

551
00:43:04,708 --> 00:43:07,968
It says it really small
right there at the bottom.

552
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,845
All right. Take me
to the Museum of Natural History.

553
00:43:11,037 --> 00:43:15,065
- You know, in my country we do
have a saying-- - I'm sure you do.

554
00:43:15,161 --> 00:43:15,353
- You know, in my country we do
have a saying-- - I'm sure you do.

555
00:43:15,353 --> 00:43:19,668
The saying goes: "The museum is closed at
5::00. You go the next morning at 9::00."

556
00:43:21,874 --> 00:43:24,654
Excuse me, Mr. Pushy!

557
00:43:24,846 --> 00:43:26,572
Son of a bitch.

558
00:43:28,682 --> 00:43:31,655
I'm getting sick and tired
of your--

559
00:43:42,299 --> 00:43:44,217
Mm-hmm.

560
00:43:48,245 --> 00:43:50,354
No, he'd never fit in there.

561
00:43:50,546 --> 00:43:54,958
Ah. Sir-

562
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,026
I'm sick and tired
of these games.

563
00:44:02,821 --> 00:44:07,424
This is stupid. Stupid. We're
a government agency, for God sakes.

564
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:12,603
Huh?

565
00:44:14,903 --> 00:44:16,630
Aha!

566
00:44:21,042 --> 00:44:23,822
Good God!
You're sicker than I thought!

567
00:44:25,069 --> 00:44:27,466
What is it, Coleman?
I'm busy!

568
00:44:27,658 --> 00:44:31,111
- I, uh, can see that.
- You wouldn't understand.

569
00:44:31,303 --> 00:44:33,220
It's the ancient art
of origatsi.

570
00:44:33,508 --> 00:44:37,152
What I don't understand is your insistence
in keeping Steele on this assignment!

571
00:44:37,344 --> 00:44:39,550
He still is
no closer to Rancor,

572
00:44:39,646 --> 00:44:42,426
and we have who knows how little time
left before Rancor launches this satellite.

573
00:44:42,522 --> 00:44:46,742
You better let me take over
this search before I--

574
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:48,659
Before you what, Coleman?

575
00:44:48,851 --> 00:44:50,865
I don't know whose monkey
you spanked to get this job,

576
00:44:51,057 --> 00:44:53,646
but as far as I'm concerned,
you're a disgrace to the Service.

577
00:44:53,742 --> 00:44:55,564
How dare you!

578
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:58,057
You and your one-for-all-and-all-for-one
bleeding heart nonsense!

579
00:44:58,249 --> 00:45:00,934
You're too old
to run this agency!

580
00:45:01,126 --> 00:45:03,332
And since you won't step down,

581
00:45:03,524 --> 00:45:06,112
you'll, uh, be stepped on!

582
00:45:08,222 --> 00:45:11,579
- Ha! Loser!

583
00:45:11,771 --> 00:45:16,085
- What you got?
- Is there a jewelery district in Los Angeles?

584
00:45:16,277 --> 00:45:19,730
Come on, this is Hollywood. We have jewelery.
We have women who are willing to sleep--

585
00:45:19,922 --> 00:45:23,757
- More important, is there a Russian jewelery section?
- Da.

586
00:45:23,949 --> 00:45:26,347
- Where?
- I don't know.

587
00:45:26,538 --> 00:45:30,087
There used to be a bunch of Russian
jewelers hung out at the warehouse at, uh...

588
00:45:31,525 --> 00:45:33,443
at 31st and Phlegm.

589
00:45:33,634 --> 00:45:36,991
- Ah, damn it!

590
00:45:37,183 --> 00:45:38,909
Meet me back at the hotel.
We'll split up.

591
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:41,018
- After you.
- Thank you.

592
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:42,937
Excuse me.

593
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,334
- Get off!

594
00:46:01,157 --> 00:46:03,459
Whoa! Whoa! Wh-Whoa!

595
00:46:16,308 --> 00:46:18,322
Watch it! Watch it!

596
00:46:31,076 --> 00:46:32,802
- Whoa.

597
00:46:36,159 --> 00:46:37,885
- Cheerio.

598
00:47:03,968 --> 00:47:07,133
You're mine, Steele!

599
00:47:13,846 --> 00:47:15,956
- Whoa!

600
00:47:18,737 --> 00:47:21,134
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

601
00:47:26,696 --> 00:47:30,532
- Huh?

602
00:47:50,383 --> 00:47:54,697
Okay, bring it up!
Bring it up! Up, up, up!

603
00:47:54,889 --> 00:47:57,766
Okay, that's where
the sign goes!

604
00:47:59,685 --> 00:48:01,603
Ah, 31st and Phlegm.

605
00:48:01,794 --> 00:48:03,520
I'm on the waiting list
for a co-op.

606
00:48:09,946 --> 00:48:12,342
You better get outta here.
I'll see you back in half an hour.

607
00:48:12,438 --> 00:48:14,356
Oh, half hour?
I can drop off my dog at the groomer.

608
00:48:44,276 --> 00:48:48,687
- Wha--
- Mr. Steele, I presume?

609
00:48:48,783 --> 00:48:52,524
- Professor--
- Ukrinsky. With a "Y.'"

610
00:49:01,538 --> 00:49:04,798
Ah. Right.

611
00:49:07,004 --> 00:49:09,497
The pendant.

612
00:49:09,689 --> 00:49:11,798
And I suppose...

613
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:14,100
this is what you need.

614
00:49:14,196 --> 00:49:18,990
- And this is?
- This is the controller chip for Rancor's satellite.

615
00:49:19,182 --> 00:49:21,484
Ah, Rancor finally
made his megachip.

616
00:49:21,771 --> 00:49:23,498
Who'd have thought the fate
of so many human lives...

617
00:49:23,689 --> 00:49:25,608
would rely on something so small?

618
00:49:25,799 --> 00:49:28,580
Well, there's only one thing
to do with this.

619
00:49:31,649 --> 00:49:35,964
No! No! What are you doing?

620
00:49:36,155 --> 00:49:39,608
- Trying to make the world safe from tyranny.
- You mustn't do that!

621
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:42,294
This can also be used
for world peace!

622
00:49:42,389 --> 00:49:44,307
Oh, I'm sorry.

623
00:49:44,498 --> 00:49:48,143
You'd better let me get that into
the proper hands and get you to safety.

624
00:49:50,732 --> 00:49:52,841
- You found me through my daughter, the pendant.
- Right.

625
00:49:53,033 --> 00:49:57,157
- Veronique is safe?
- Yeah, the van they took her in has dual air bags and seat belts.

626
00:49:59,747 --> 00:50:02,239
- Kabul.
- Nice new wheels, huh?

627
00:50:02,431 --> 00:50:05,884
Yeah, quite an improvement.
In the back, Professor.

628
00:50:06,076 --> 00:50:08,665
We have to find a safe place
for the professor.

629
00:50:08,857 --> 00:50:10,678
In my country,
we have saying:

630
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:13,939
"The rabbit hops, the spider crawls,
but the camel spits".

631
00:50:14,131 --> 00:50:16,049
Let's see
if this Charger can run.

632
00:50:21,419 --> 00:50:23,337
Now I don't want you
to be surprised.

633
00:50:23,529 --> 00:50:27,364
This guy's one of our top agents.
He's most capable.

634
00:50:32,543 --> 00:50:34,460
- McCluckey!
- Kabul!

635
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:42,037
- Come on in.
- All right. Come on.

636
00:50:42,229 --> 00:50:44,625
McCluckey, we need
to hide the professor.

637
00:50:44,913 --> 00:50:47,886
- Professor Ukrinsky, it's an honor.
- How do you do?

638
00:50:48,078 --> 00:50:51,051
I've read all your work and your
last paper on laboratory loneliness.

639
00:50:51,243 --> 00:50:53,831
- Superb!
- Well, thank you.

640
00:50:54,023 --> 00:50:56,421
- McCluckey, I'd like you to
meet Agent-- - Dick Steele.

641
00:50:56,613 --> 00:51:00,064
Agent WD-40.
Good to see you back in action.

642
00:51:00,256 --> 00:51:04,764
Your video on deception,
Is It A Woman? Is The Moustache Real?

643
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:06,682
Beautiful work!

644
00:51:06,778 --> 00:51:10,134
- Thank you.
- McCluckey, we need to hide this guy.

645
00:51:10,326 --> 00:51:13,586
Sure, sure. Come this way.
He'll be safe here.

646
00:51:14,641 --> 00:51:16,464
Do you have a telephone?

647
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:18,477
Right over there.

648
00:51:18,668 --> 00:51:21,642
- Is it clean?
- I have a woman that comes in once a week.

649
00:51:25,861 --> 00:51:28,450
- Sir?
- What?

650
00:51:28,642 --> 00:51:31,135
I have Dick "Luscious Lips"
Steele on the line.

651
00:51:31,327 --> 00:51:34,395
Put him through.

652
00:51:34,587 --> 00:51:36,313
Director, is it safe?

653
00:51:36,409 --> 00:51:41,492
Safe? Just
a minute. I'll use the cloaking device.

654
00:51:50,793 --> 00:51:52,903
Go ahead, Dick.
It's safe.

655
00:51:53,095 --> 00:51:56,356
I have the chip
Rancor needs to launch his satellite.

656
00:51:56,548 --> 00:52:00,575
Good, Dick, good. Are you coming in?

657
00:52:00,767 --> 00:52:02,781
No, Rancor kidnapped
the professor's daughter.

658
00:52:02,973 --> 00:52:04,891
I've got to find her.

659
00:52:05,083 --> 00:52:07,863
- Yes, well... good, Dick.

660
00:52:08,055 --> 00:52:11,795
Good luck.
Call me if I can help.

661
00:52:19,755 --> 00:52:23,399
- Nineteen hours and 35 minutes.
- That Steele's gonna be sorry...

662
00:52:23,591 --> 00:52:25,700
his mama ever met his papa.

663
00:52:25,796 --> 00:52:29,824
- We gonna heat up the fire! Boys!

664
00:52:30,016 --> 00:52:31,742
They always seem to know
every move we make.

665
00:52:31,934 --> 00:52:33,659
It's inside.
It's got to be somebody inside leaking.

666
00:52:33,851 --> 00:52:36,440
Well, I'm not leaking.
I can prove it.

667
00:52:36,632 --> 00:52:38,359
- You go ahead, ask me something.
- What?

668
00:52:38,550 --> 00:52:41,235
Ask me something.
Ask me who's the director of our agency.

669
00:52:41,427 --> 00:52:44,400
- Who is the director of our agency?
- I don't know.

670
00:52:44,592 --> 00:52:46,318
You see, I know who it is, you see?

671
00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:50,345
But I'm not going to tell you,
you see, because I am no leak.

672
00:52:50,441 --> 00:52:52,935
This place has got to be
a front for Rancor and his men.

673
00:52:53,126 --> 00:52:57,922
- There's one of them now. Follow him.

674
00:52:58,113 --> 00:53:00,510
Do you have
to keep revving the engine?

675
00:53:00,702 --> 00:53:04,730
Ah, but it's an American V-8.
It's such a beautiful sound.

676
00:53:05,018 --> 00:53:07,031
- Oh, Steele, listen to this.

677
00:53:07,223 --> 00:53:10,292
- My cousin's a recording star.

678
00:53:10,484 --> 00:53:12,881
- Duck! Ow!

679
00:53:24,005 --> 00:53:26,498
- Did he see us?
- Shh. Okay.

680
00:53:33,594 --> 00:53:35,800
- I'm going in there.
- Okay.

681
00:53:35,896 --> 00:53:39,253
- Give me cover.
- I got to buy my lottery ticket.

682
00:53:44,431 --> 00:53:46,829
- Rancor's guy is here.
- Right.

683
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:50,664
That saved a wretch

684
00:53:50,856 --> 00:53:53,349
Like me

685
00:53:53,541 --> 00:53:57,952
I once was lost

686
00:53:58,239 --> 00:54:02,747
But now am found

687
00:54:02,939 --> 00:54:05,049
Was blind--

688
00:54:09,076 --> 00:54:12,721
- What are you doing here?
- I am... the new choirmaster.

689
00:54:12,912 --> 00:54:16,939
- Where did you come from?
- The humble room. I was doing refractories.

690
00:54:17,035 --> 00:54:19,625
- "Refractories"?
- A new popal revelate.

691
00:54:19,817 --> 00:54:22,501
Uh, John, chapter 7, verse 2.

692
00:54:22,693 --> 00:54:23,940
"Popal"?

693
00:54:24,132 --> 00:54:27,776
Uh, sisters.
Michael, chapter 7, verse 2.

694
00:54:27,968 --> 00:54:29,790
"Sing as ye play.

695
00:54:29,982 --> 00:54:33,529
Yea, unto thee
a voice like a blenth."

696
00:54:33,721 --> 00:54:36,119
And as you approach
the allo tropo, please,

697
00:54:36,311 --> 00:54:40,050
tres mucho picante abierto.

698
00:54:40,242 --> 00:54:43,407
- You know you make me want to shout

699
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:46,284
Kick my heels up and shout
Throw my hands up and shout

700
00:54:46,476 --> 00:54:49,352
Throw my head back and shout
Come on now

701
00:54:49,544 --> 00:54:51,558
Don't forget
to say you will

702
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:54,435
- Are you gentlemen with Rancor?

703
00:54:54,627 --> 00:54:57,695
- Steele's here somewhere.

704
00:54:57,887 --> 00:55:00,381
- Sing it right now baby
- Well, find him!

705
00:55:00,572 --> 00:55:02,490
- Say you will
- Come on, come on

706
00:55:02,682 --> 00:55:07,093
- Say you will
- Say that you will

707
00:55:07,285 --> 00:55:09,778
Say that you love me

708
00:55:09,970 --> 00:55:12,847
Say that you need me
Say that you want me

709
00:55:13,039 --> 00:55:16,203
- You want to please me
- Come on now

710
00:55:16,395 --> 00:55:20,423
Come on now
Come on now

711
00:55:20,615 --> 00:55:25,218
I still remember when
I used to be nine years old

712
00:55:25,409 --> 00:55:28,670
- Hey, yeah and I was a fool for you
- All right, random inspection.

713
00:55:28,862 --> 00:55:31,738
- From the bottom of my soul
- Directive 21, Psalm 2.

714
00:55:31,930 --> 00:55:36,150
Yeah, yeah
I want you to know

715
00:55:36,342 --> 00:55:40,177
- I said I want you
to know right now Ew!

716
00:55:40,465 --> 00:55:42,671
You been good to me sisters

717
00:55:42,863 --> 00:55:45,356
Much better than I've been to myself

718
00:55:45,548 --> 00:55:47,849
So good, so good

719
00:55:48,041 --> 00:55:52,740
And if you ever leave me
I don't want nobody else

720
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:57,438
Hey, hey
I said I want you to know

721
00:55:57,630 --> 00:56:00,220
I said I want you
to know right now

722
00:56:00,316 --> 00:56:02,138
- Veronique?

723
00:56:02,234 --> 00:56:04,343
- Dick.
- You all right?

724
00:56:04,535 --> 00:56:08,946
- Get out of here. This is a front for Rancor.
- Yes, I know.

725
00:56:09,138 --> 00:56:14,796
I'll-- I'll get out of here, all right.
But you're coming with me.

726
00:56:14,892 --> 00:56:16,522
Stat! Code Yellow!
Code Yellow!

727
00:56:16,714 --> 00:56:19,303
- Get me three CCs of epinephrinox!
- Right away.

728
00:56:19,495 --> 00:56:21,988
- Get me two liters of gasohol mixed with neonephicine!
- On my way.

729
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:24,385
- Get the electrostatifyer, now!
- I'll warm up the generator, sister.

730
00:56:24,577 --> 00:56:26,495
She's about to go
into fibrolcanination!

731
00:56:26,591 --> 00:56:28,701
- Prepare the operating room!
Yes, sister. I'll get right on it.

732
00:56:31,673 --> 00:56:35,318
For God's sake, can anyone
in this hospital help me?

733
00:56:35,510 --> 00:56:39,537
- Say it right now, baby

734
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:41,647
- Come on, come on.

735
00:56:43,181 --> 00:56:45,099
- Say that you will.

736
00:56:45,291 --> 00:56:49,127
- Now wait a minute

737
00:56:49,414 --> 00:56:52,292
Oh. Mm-mm. No.

738
00:56:52,483 --> 00:56:54,400
You know you make me
want to shout

739
00:57:03,798 --> 00:57:05,908
High blood pressure.

740
00:57:10,032 --> 00:57:14,347
Here. You'll be safe here.
I'll be right back.

741
00:57:23,074 --> 00:57:26,910
- Okay, the coast is clear.

742
00:57:27,006 --> 00:57:31,609
Oh, Dick, it's so cold.

743
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:36,020
What have they done to you?
They'll pay for this.

744
00:57:36,212 --> 00:57:38,033
Oh, Dick...

745
00:57:45,130 --> 00:57:47,719
Move 'em, fat heads!

746
00:57:47,815 --> 00:57:50,309
Sisters, make 'em holy!

747
00:57:52,706 --> 00:57:55,007
Oh, Dick, you came for me.

748
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:58,556
Tell me, what's been happening?

749
00:57:58,843 --> 00:58:02,295
Well, I've been doing a lot of soul-searching,
getting in touch with my inner child.

750
00:58:02,487 --> 00:58:04,213
I have decided I love you.

751
00:58:04,405 --> 00:58:06,515
But what about my father?

752
00:58:06,707 --> 00:58:09,776
Well, I like him.
I just have to get to know him better.

753
00:58:09,968 --> 00:58:12,172
No, is he okay?
Have you got his chip?

754
00:58:12,364 --> 00:58:14,474
Oh, no, he's fine,
and I've got the chip.

755
00:58:14,666 --> 00:58:16,872
- Oh, I love you too.

756
00:58:20,515 --> 00:58:24,064
- Look out, you crazy nun!

757
00:58:30,105 --> 00:58:32,503
Thanks, guys, I stopped you.
You could have been killed!

758
00:58:32,695 --> 00:58:36,146
Quick, let me help.

759
00:58:36,338 --> 00:58:38,160
You smell nice.

760
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:42,764
Where is my father?

761
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:44,681
Is he safe?

762
00:58:44,777 --> 00:58:48,038
He's safe, Veronique.
Safe as you and me.

763
00:58:48,230 --> 00:58:50,436
So cute.

764
00:58:50,627 --> 00:58:52,832
- Oh! Oh!

765
00:58:52,928 --> 00:58:55,134
- Safer.

766
00:58:55,326 --> 00:58:58,491
In my country, when an irate,
armless, psychotic weirdo...

767
00:58:58,683 --> 00:59:00,409
chase your woman,
you must hide her.

768
00:59:01,655 --> 00:59:03,477
Upstairs.
Apartment 5B.

769
00:59:03,669 --> 00:59:05,491
I'll wait downstairs.
I'll keep my eyes open.

770
00:59:09,518 --> 00:59:12,587
I just put in new carpet.
Take your shoes off.

771
00:59:19,971 --> 00:59:24,191
Oh, Dick... it is so nice to know...

772
00:59:24,479 --> 00:59:27,163
that everything
is going to be all right.

773
00:59:28,985 --> 00:59:31,287
You have the chip.

774
00:59:31,479 --> 00:59:34,931
My father is safe.

775
00:59:35,122 --> 00:59:37,616
You love me, Dick.

776
00:59:37,808 --> 00:59:39,630
Love?

777
00:59:41,069 --> 00:59:44,808
Let me tell you
about love, Veronique.

778
00:59:45,096 --> 00:59:48,548
Love is a dew drop
on a rose petal.

779
00:59:48,644 --> 00:59:51,234
- Love is a drop of rain,

780
00:59:51,426 --> 00:59:54,590
pure and shimmering
and trembling.

781
00:59:54,781 --> 00:59:57,850
So moist, so wet.

782
00:59:58,042 --> 01:00:02,837
- And those tiny little drops of love,

783
01:00:03,028 --> 01:00:04,851
they come together,

784
01:00:05,043 --> 01:00:08,878
gathering up broken buds
and fallen flowers...

785
01:00:09,070 --> 01:00:13,002
and dirt and dung...

786
01:00:13,194 --> 01:00:15,016
- and deer droppings,

787
01:00:15,208 --> 01:00:19,714
flowing faster and faster,
outward to the sea.

788
01:00:19,906 --> 01:00:22,304
- Onward and onward -

789
01:00:45,127 --> 01:00:46,949
Good night.

790
01:00:47,141 --> 01:00:50,784
We'll talk more
in the morning.

791
01:01:16,964 --> 01:01:19,170
- Hey, hotshots.

792
01:01:19,458 --> 01:01:23,006
- Come and get me. - Why, you
little, no- good juvenile delinquent!

793
01:01:23,198 --> 01:01:24,828
- Go on! Get him!
- Come on!

794
01:01:26,650 --> 01:01:29,719
- Cool. Heads up!

795
01:01:31,157 --> 01:01:33,362
- Nice shot. I'm going.
- Go on! Go on!

796
01:01:33,458 --> 01:01:36,623
- We got you now!

797
01:01:36,815 --> 01:01:38,733
Where's the professor?

798
01:01:38,925 --> 01:01:41,131
With Gilligan, dickweed.

799
01:01:45,158 --> 01:01:47,939
- No!
- This is for Getting Even With Dad!

800
01:01:48,035 --> 01:01:50,528
- And this is for My Girl.
- And this is for My Girl 2.

801
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:53,597
I wasn't even in My Girl 2.

802
01:01:53,789 --> 01:01:55,899
- We don't care!
- We don't care!

803
01:01:59,062 --> 01:02:00,789
Last time I'm gonna ask you,
smart boy.

804
01:02:00,981 --> 01:02:04,433
- Where's the professor?
- Okay, okay, down the hall to the right.

805
01:02:06,064 --> 01:02:08,269
Okay, the left!

806
01:02:12,105 --> 01:02:14,119
Help! Somebody help me!

807
01:02:14,311 --> 01:02:17,571
They're taking us to Kikiree lsland!

808
01:02:20,831 --> 01:02:25,626
- They've taken him to Rancor!
- They won't kill him... not until he's installed the chip.

809
01:02:25,914 --> 01:02:29,270
- Wha-- - Probably not even then.
Maybe just torture him a little.

810
01:02:29,462 --> 01:02:32,818
- We'll talk about this on the way.
Let's get to Kikiree.

811
01:02:43,271 --> 01:02:45,573
You like this disguise?

812
01:02:45,764 --> 01:02:47,683
It's very good.

813
01:02:47,874 --> 01:02:49,600
I'm proud of this one.

814
01:02:49,792 --> 01:02:52,956
Like this,
I can look like anybody.

815
01:02:53,148 --> 01:02:56,889
- Rancor Industries
owns this little island.

816
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:57,176
- Rancor Industries
owns this little island.

817
01:02:57,176 --> 01:03:01,491
The natives say there are stranger goings-on
here than at Neverland Valley Ranch.

818
01:03:01,587 --> 01:03:04,273
- Look.
- Uh-huh. It's nice.

819
01:03:05,711 --> 01:03:09,546
- Kabul, stay in the boat.
- Why?

820
01:03:09,738 --> 01:03:11,465
There's a saying
in my country:

821
01:03:11,656 --> 01:03:14,533
"When you hear the words, 'Stay in
the boat', you stay in the boat."

822
01:03:14,724 --> 01:03:16,739
- Bye-bye.

823
01:03:24,122 --> 01:03:26,616
Dick, this is crazy.

824
01:03:26,808 --> 01:03:31,794
Crazy? Some people think walking down
the street muttering to yourself is crazy.

825
01:03:31,986 --> 01:03:33,712
I'll tell you
what crazy is.

826
01:03:33,904 --> 01:03:36,493
Crazy is walking down the street
with half a cantaloupe on your head,

827
01:03:36,685 --> 01:03:38,699
saying, "I'm a hamster.'"

828
01:03:38,891 --> 01:03:41,096
"I'm a hamster.'"
That's crazy.

829
01:03:47,905 --> 01:03:49,823
- Ooh.

830
01:03:50,014 --> 01:03:52,700
My life's work
is now complete.

831
01:03:52,892 --> 01:03:55,385
Your cooperation
is commendable, Professor.

832
01:03:55,577 --> 01:03:57,302
Thank you.

833
01:04:00,371 --> 01:04:02,098
Throw him in the cell.

834
01:04:02,290 --> 01:04:05,166
- But you said it was
for the world peace! Yeah, yeah.

835
01:04:13,605 --> 01:04:17,537
Hello, General. It's Skippy.
They're on the island.

836
01:04:17,825 --> 01:04:19,935
Yeah.

837
01:04:20,126 --> 01:04:23,386
Well, well, well,
what perfect timing.

838
01:04:23,578 --> 01:04:25,400
- It seems we're gonna have more guests.

839
01:04:25,496 --> 01:04:27,510
- Steele's not dead.

840
01:04:27,702 --> 01:04:29,428
He's on his way here.

841
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:33,072
- Throw her in with the others!
- No! Please! Please!

842
01:04:33,264 --> 01:04:37,100
- I thought you loved me!
- Naw, I was just usin' you.

846
01:04:50,717 --> 01:04:53,210
Dick, look out!

847
01:04:53,498 --> 01:04:56,950
- Got you now, Steele.

848
01:04:57,142 --> 01:04:59,060
Hey, where you goin'?

849
01:04:59,252 --> 01:05:03,855
Take that!

850
01:05:03,951 --> 01:05:05,868
Hey, come back here!

851
01:05:08,937 --> 01:05:11,335
Nowhere to go, Steele.

852
01:05:16,897 --> 01:05:19,582
How fast can you run, my friend?

853
01:05:19,774 --> 01:05:22,170
- My God!

854
01:05:23,993 --> 01:05:25,911
All right, men, tie him up.

855
01:05:26,103 --> 01:05:28,884
- Okay, go ahead, kill me.

856
01:05:29,076 --> 01:05:32,623
I got a bomb. You touch me,
and you'll blow up yourself.

857
01:05:32,815 --> 01:05:36,651
You don't really think I'm gonna fall for
that old tied- to-the-bomb trick, do ya?

858
01:05:36,843 --> 01:05:43,076
- Well, how about the old snake trick?

859
01:05:43,268 --> 01:05:46,241
- Ahh!

860
01:06:05,899 --> 01:06:07,721
- What is it?
- Shh.

861
01:06:15,489 --> 01:06:18,366

865

We've got to find a way
into Rancor's complex.

866

- Are you ready?
- Ready.

867
01:07:13,410 --> 01:07:15,136
Here, help me with this.

868
01:07:15,328 --> 01:07:18,397
- How patriotic, Dick.
- And deadly.

869
01:07:18,589 --> 01:07:20,698
Ooh, Dick.

Hi, Mark.

872
01:07:33,645 --> 01:07:36,137
Get set.

873
01:07:36,329 --> 01:07:38,727
- Father!
- My child.

874
01:07:38,918 --> 01:07:43,522
Well, well.
Dick Steele.

875
01:07:43,714 --> 01:07:46,398
I'd shake your hand,
but I don't remember where it landed.

876
01:07:46,590 --> 01:07:49,947
- Clever! Clever? Clever.

877
01:07:50,139 --> 01:07:52,153
Take their weapons.

878
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:57,427
- Mm-hmm.

879
01:07:59,728 --> 01:08:02,796
Throw her in with the others.
Bind him.

880
01:08:06,537 --> 01:08:09,893
- Oh, Papa.

881
01:08:10,084 --> 01:08:12,674
- Dick Steele?
- Oh, Ms. Dahl.

882
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,222
- Barbara Dahl.
- Get your paws off me,

883
01:08:16,318 --> 01:08:18,331
- Huh.
- you damn dirty apes!

884
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:24,278
- No!
- You remember Barbara Dahl.

885
01:08:24,470 --> 01:08:26,196
Victoria's daughter?

886
01:08:26,388 --> 01:08:31,566
I'd like to see you watch her go up
like you watched her mother go down.

887
01:08:31,757 --> 01:08:36,072
But I'd rather let you just be
a dessert for my little pet.

888
01:08:37,895 --> 01:08:40,676
What's left of you will have
to watch helplessly...

889
01:08:40,772 --> 01:08:45,278
while I play Mortal Kombat
with the entire world!

890
01:09:23,446 --> 01:09:27,952
Huh?

891
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:38,022
It's gonna blow! Hurry up!

892
01:09:48,858 --> 01:09:51,638
Come on!

893
01:10:32,587 --> 01:10:34,504
You are very immature.

894
01:10:34,696 --> 01:10:36,902
Bullies tend to have
very bad self- esteem.

895
01:10:39,108 --> 01:10:42,176
Aha!

896
01:10:43,710 --> 01:10:46,204
Oh-ho!

897
01:10:49,081 --> 01:10:51,382
Leave me alone!
I'm an unarmed man!

898
01:11:21,398 --> 01:11:25,137
- Oh, Miss Cheevus.
- Dick, I'm sorry.

899
01:11:25,329 --> 01:11:28,590
- One minute and 22 seconds.
One minute and 21 seconds.

900
01:11:28,782 --> 01:11:30,796
- One minute and 20 seconds.
- You were under the influence of an evil man.

901
01:11:30,988 --> 01:11:32,905
- One minute and 19 seconds.
- It was still a lousy thing to do.

902
01:11:33,096 --> 01:11:36,741
One minute and 18 seconds.
One minute and 17 seconds.

903
01:11:36,837 --> 01:11:41,248
- One minute and 16 seconds.
- Oh-oh. General, it's broken.

904
01:11:41,344 --> 01:11:45,084
Well, you'll like space.
Lots of elbow room and--

905
01:11:45,276 --> 01:11:47,290
- One minute and 12 seconds.
- Oh, whoops. Sorry.

906
01:11:47,386 --> 01:11:50,837
- One minute and 11 seconds.
One minute and ten seconds.

907
01:11:51,029 --> 01:11:55,441
Y eah, you lose, Steele!
That countdown is irreversible!

908
01:11:55,633 --> 01:11:58,509
- Really?

909
01:11:58,701 --> 01:12:00,043
- One minute and five seconds.
- Well...

910
01:12:00,235 --> 01:12:02,058
- let's just see how...
- We need to go!

911
01:12:02,249 --> 01:12:05,031
- One minute and three seconds.
- irreversible that really is.

912
01:12:05,127 --> 01:12:06,948
It's irreversible,

913
01:12:07,044 --> 01:12:10,113
and there's nothing you
patriotic pansies can do about it!

914
01:12:10,305 --> 01:12:12,415
- 59 seconds, 58 seconds. Let me tell you
what being patriotic really is,

915
01:12:12,606 --> 01:12:15,291
you scumbag poop.

916
01:12:15,578 --> 01:12:18,935
This is a great country where a man can
sue anyone he wants anytime he wants.

917
01:12:19,127 --> 01:12:22,676
It's a great country because
thousands of people die every year...

918
01:12:22,772 --> 01:12:25,168
from handguns, and,
yet, at this very moment,

919
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:29,964
you can still walk into a convenience
store anywhere and buy one of those guns.

920
01:12:30,155 --> 01:12:32,264
- That's democracy.
- It's finally time somebody does...

921
01:12:32,456 --> 01:12:34,278
what that fool Steele
should have done.

922
01:12:34,470 --> 01:12:36,101
- This is a great country...
- And it's gonna be me!

923
01:12:36,292 --> 01:12:41,087
- because anyone who's male has the right...
- Let's go!

924
01:12:41,183 --> 01:12:44,540
- to run for the office of the President.
- Let's go! Move it!

925
01:12:44,731 --> 01:12:47,417
- This is a great country
because any moron can

926
01:12:47,609 --> 01:12:49,622
- All right, everyone, drop your guns!

927
01:12:49,813 --> 01:12:51,827
I'm, uh, taking over!

928
01:12:54,417 --> 01:12:56,623
Steele... get down from there.

929
01:12:56,815 --> 01:13:00,362
- Dick, come on. We have to go.

930
01:13:00,458 --> 01:13:03,048
- Now!
- Oh!

931
01:13:03,144 --> 01:13:04,966
- Come on! Come on!
- I wasn't finished.

932
01:13:05,158 --> 01:13:06,883
Quick! Hurry up! Just move it!

933
01:13:07,075 --> 01:13:08,801
Twenty seconds.

934
01:13:12,158 --> 01:13:15,514
Steele, you're always
doing this to me!

935
01:13:17,528 --> 01:13:19,925
- You lose, Steele!

936
01:13:20,021 --> 01:13:21,844
I'm not through!
I'll be back!

937
01:13:21,939 --> 01:13:24,336
Maybe just tissue or a brain!

938
01:13:24,528 --> 01:13:27,213
- Open the door! I'm stuck in here!
- I'll be back!

939
01:13:27,405 --> 01:13:30,570
- I'm going up, but you
and your whole world...

940
01:13:30,761 --> 01:13:32,679
are going down!

941
01:13:32,871 --> 01:13:35,364
- I'll be back, maybe without legs...
- Open the damn door!

942
01:13:35,556 --> 01:13:39,200
- or some other minor organ.
- Wait! I don't want to miss the fireworks!

943
01:13:50,708 --> 01:13:52,722
How about a hand
for General Rancor?

944
01:13:54,736 --> 01:13:57,420
You're not through with me!

945
01:13:58,763 --> 01:14:01,256
- Ah, well.

946
01:14:01,448 --> 01:14:01,448
- Houston, we have a problem.

947
01:14:21,011 --> 01:14:26,477
A man of intrigue
He lives for the thrill

948
01:14:29,258 --> 01:14:34,820
Always has places to go
and people to kill

949
01:14:36,930 --> 01:14:39,998
Danger is the game he plays

950
01:14:40,190 --> 01:14:44,026
And he holds every card

951
01:14:44,218 --> 01:14:47,094
'Cause if you wanna win

952
01:14:47,286 --> 01:14:50,451
You gotta spy hard

953
01:14:53,232 --> 01:14:58,219
A man of the world
so suave and discreet

954
01:15:00,904 --> 01:15:06,082
He trips over the women
piled up at his feet

955
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:11,740
But evil's lurking

956
01:15:11,931 --> 01:15:16,247
So he's always on his guard

957
01:15:16,439 --> 01:15:19,316
'Cause if you're gonna spy

958
01:15:19,508 --> 01:15:24,494
You better spy hard

959
01:15:24,686 --> 01:15:27,947
He's always there

960
01:15:28,139 --> 01:15:32,549
When the chips
are beginning to fall

961
01:15:32,741 --> 01:15:36,002
He wouldn't care

962
01:15:36,194 --> 01:15:38,495
If they kicked him
and grabbed him

963
01:15:38,591 --> 01:15:40,413
And shot him
and stabbed him

964
01:15:40,605 --> 01:15:44,537
And nailed both his ears
to the wall

965
01:15:46,070 --> 01:15:48,084
Facing death every day

966
01:15:48,276 --> 01:15:52,880
Is a tough job for any man

967
01:15:53,072 --> 01:15:56,331
But his hours are flexible

968
01:15:56,523 --> 01:15:59,688
And he's got
a great dental plan

969
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:04,770
By the way
if you walked in late

970
01:16:04,962 --> 01:16:08,798
Allow me to reiterate

971
01:16:08,990 --> 01:16:12,250
The name of this movie

972
01:16:12,442 --> 01:16:15,895
Was Spy Hard

973
01:16:16,086 --> 01:16:19,826
They called it Spy Hard

974
01:16:20,018 --> 01:16:23,566
You just saw Spy Hard

975
01:16:23,662 --> 01:16:29,224
It's the end of Spy Hard
