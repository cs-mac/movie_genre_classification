1
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,050
<i>What happened to my hair?</i>

2
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,930
<i>Looks like shit.</i>

3
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,560
<i>I hated going to school here.</i>

4
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,940
<i>Fuck, I'm hungry. I should've gone
to Starbucks on the way here.</i>

5
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:58,530
<i>Why did I have to marry into a family
that needs to donate things like chapels?</i>

6
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,000
<i>They hate that I'm married
to their daughter.</i>

7
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,670
<i>They hate that I'm working at their bank.</i>

8
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,540
<i>I hate that I'm working at their bank.</i>

9
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:16,010
<i>Next summer,
they want to go shoot an elephant.</i>

10
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,840
<i>Who the fuck
wants to shoot an elephant?</i>

11
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:19,970
<i>I'll probably have to shoot an elephant.</i>

12
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,020
<i>I'm waxy.</i>

13
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,350
<i>The fuck, I'm old. It's depressing.</i>

14
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,110
<i>I don't want to be old.</i>

15
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,780
<i>I'm gonna be old and waxy
and working at a bank.</i>

16
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,280
<i>And now my pants
are riding up my ass.</i>

17
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:38,030
Do not tell the principal that I'm here.

18
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,160
Fuck.

19
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:51,630
Did someone
just run through here?

20
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:55,590
Uh, no.
Not that I know of.

21
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:57,510
Why? What's going on?

22
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:00,760
Nothing.

23
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,890
Just thought I saw
one of the kids running in here.

24
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,390
No, it's just me.

25
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:06,350
Oh, hey, Bill.

26
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:11,190
So this is a, uh,
pretty big day for your family.

27
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,480
You know, your father-in-law's
really outdone himself this time.

28
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:16,690
The John Jacoby Family Chapel.

29
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,780
He is truly a godsend.

30
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,950
I heard he might run for mayor,
and to tell you the truth, I'd vote for him.

31
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,870
He's a hell of a guy.

32
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,080
Um...

33
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,540
Hey, um,

34
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,080
did anyone mention to you about the new
mentor program that we're doing here?

35
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:33,460
No.

36
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,380
Kids love the program,
and it helps them think about their futures.

37
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,010
You know, if you're interested,
you should sign up today.

38
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,970
We'll set you up with a student.

39
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,470
Yeah. I'm sure. Why not?

40
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,560
Well, listen, uh,

41
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,140
your brother and father-in-law
are probably waiting to break ground,

42
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,810
so I'll, uh... I'll meet you outside?

43
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,740
You can come out now.

44
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:04,990
Hey, I don't know
why you lied for me,

45
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,660
but thanks, man.

46
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,620
You kiddin'?

47
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,540
You can keep your money.

48
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,380
All right.

49
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,380
I think I'm gonna hang out here
for a few minutes

50
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,670
just so I don't get busted.

51
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,050
All right.

52
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,560
He committed to rebuilding the chapel

53
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:37,230
three years ago, after the fire,

54
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,450
and he and Janice made good.

55
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,110
On behalf of the Tate Schools,

56
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,780
I'm proud to present
the future site

57
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:49,160
of the John Jacoby Family Chapel.

58
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,630
Everybody looks great.
Get closer together.

59
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,050
Bill. Bill.

60
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,310
<i>This is Chip Johnson, On the Scene,
at the Tate Preparatory School,</i>

61
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,640
and we have Maria Sanchez
with us here today.

62
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,560
Here's Maria.

63
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:22,150
That's the bell. Cut.

64
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,420
Ow!
Oh, sorry! God! Honey!

65
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,960
I'm fine. I'm fine.

66
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,220
Oh, this is, uh, Chip Johnson.

67
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,300
Oh.
Chip, my husband Bill.

68
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,350
Oh.

69
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,390
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, I just saw you out there.

70
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,100
You're Channel 11, right?

71
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,810
Are you on the scene?

72
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,150
It's a favor to Mr. Jacoby.

73
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,070
Right.

74
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:04,070
Nice to meet you. Bye, Jess.

75
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,620
You know him?

76
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,620
No.

77
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,660
I mean, I do now.
I met him today.

78
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,790
He just called you Jess.

79
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,130
Everybody calls me Jess.

80
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,840
People who know you call you Jess.

81
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,760
Okay, Bill.

82
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,470
Uh, I have to go.

83
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:27,680
Uh, is there anything special
you want for dinner tonight?

84
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,300
No. Whatever's fine.

85
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,970
Okay. Well...

86
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,140
See you later.

87
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:43,690
This is my son-in-law Bill.

88
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:46,280
He's the executive vice president...

89
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:49,780
...of human resources.

90
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:53,370
Bill is in charge of making sure

91
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,500
everything runs smoothly up front.

92
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,330
Go ahead, Bill.

93
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:03,340
Oh, well, if you have any questions,
uh, feel free to ask them.

94
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,050
Um...

95
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,300
Bill, I need five copies of this, okay?

96
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,830
Why would I want
a doughnut franchise?

97
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:40,080
It's one of the most lucrative
franchises in the country.

98
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,330
The average store
grosses over 500K,

99
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,050
and right now, the perceptions is
that people don't really believe in carbs,

100
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,840
so we can get them
at somewhat of a discount.

101
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,590
But I don't really eat doughnuts.

102
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:50,630
Well, you don't need to eat them.
You don't even need to like them.

103
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,590
Then why would I want the franchise?

104
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,640
Investment purposes.

105
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,850
You know, Eddy what's-his-name
down in accounting did that no-carb thing.

106
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,230
Lost 30 pounds.

107
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,900
Eddy Anderson.
Right.

108
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,940
Likes to run, too. Great athlete.

109
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:09,820
By the by, how's your brother?

110
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:13,450
He's great. He's fine.
Great.

111
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:16,660
And, uh, don't forget.

112
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,460
We're going hunting Saturday.

113
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:25,210
I'd like to speak to someone
regarding franchise opportunities.

114
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:31,430
Okay. Well, I'd like to leave
my cell phone number.

115
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:41,440
So, is this your bank?
I saw your face on the billboard.

116
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,100
Yeah, I have an ownership interest.

117
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:46,400
You ever go just look at the cash?

118
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,780
Can I get a tour?

119
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,200
Uh...

120
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,870
- It's against the rules.
- It's your bank.

121
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,200
- Yeah. And it has rules.
- That you make.

122
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,620
Tell me something.

123
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:03,080
Why are you interested
in having me mentor you?

124
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,840
You work at a bank. I like money.

125
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,500
Right.

126
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,760
Um, well, unfortunately,

127
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,260
it turns out that I may not be able
to participate in the program.

128
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,800
My schedule shifted today,
and it's gonna be tight.

129
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,350
That's rough.

130
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,850
Mm-hmm.

131
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:21,600
Well, if you do mentor me,
could I get a tour?

132
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,310
Yeah. Let's play it by ear.

133
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,360
All right.

134
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,820
Thanks, Bill.

135
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,270
You bet.

136
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:01,560
Yeah.

137
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,980
Okay, well... Yeah.

138
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,610
Okay, so this Saturday.

139
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:12,150
Yes, they're going hunting all day.

140
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:13,650
Trust me.

141
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,530
Meet me here at 10.

142
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,000
Yeah. All right.

143
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,760
I didn't know you were home.

144
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:40,680
Where'd you get this?

145
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,430
I really wish you'd listen to the doctor.

146
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,770
These are gonna kill you.

147
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,600
Were you on the phone?

148
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:51,730
Yeah.

149
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,360
My mom.

150
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,740
Your mom... Where is she...
your mom?

151
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,070
She's, um, home.

152
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,450
Why?

153
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:01,780
Mmm.

154
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,170
Are you gonna answer that?

155
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,470
Hello.

156
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,600
Right.

157
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,600
This is my cell phone.
Thank you.

158
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,560
Yeah. Tomorrow, 5:30.
That'll be great.

159
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,270
Yeah, I'll be alone.
Okay, thank you.

160
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,110
Who was that?
It was the office.

161
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:40,240
The office wants to know if you're
gonna be alone tomorrow at 5:30?

162
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,370
It's... I'm working on a deal.

163
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:43,450
A deal?

164
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:45,240
Yeah. I have deals.

165
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:48,410
Come on. What deal?
A financial deal.

166
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,330
You're lying.
I am not.

167
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:53,210
I can tell. You have
your hands on your hips.

168
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:57,460
You know what?
A thief thinks everyone steals.

169
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,390
That's right.

170
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:06,140
Okay.

171
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,930
I'm gonna watch TV.

172
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,310
I'm gonna call your mom.

173
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,390
Okay.

174
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,480
At home.

175
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,730
All right.

176
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,490
<i>So again for tomorrow</i>

177
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:22,360
<i>it's going to be partly sunny
with highs around 83,</i>

178
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,700
<i>the lows in the upper 60s.</i>

179
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:26,330
Your mom wasn't home.

180
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,870
Oh, look, here it is.

181
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:34,540
<i>There is nothing
more important than community.</i>

182
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,000
Bet you a thousand dollars
he runs for mayor.

183
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,710
<i>You know, I was, uh...</i>

184
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:43,800
Is that my stomach?
Is that my stomach?

185
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,260
Oh, my God, I'm The Blob.

186
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:47,850
Okay, move, I can't see.

187
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:50,350
Oh, my God.

188
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:19,300
I have to remember
to go to the store.

189
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,050
Mmm.

190
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:22,720
Too bad there's not a place
where you can get

191
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,760
a really good hot, fresh doughnut.

192
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:28,100
Yeah. You really need
to cut back on the sugar.

193
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,180
Mmm.

194
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,520
Speaking of cutting back,

195
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,140
I've been reviewing
our financial situation,

196
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,810
and I think that we should
consider diversifying.

197
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,690
Okay. Just ask my dad.

198
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:43,650
Wouldn't it be nice to be less
dependent on your... father?

199
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,280
I'm not dependent on him.

200
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,000
Love you.

201
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:09,260
<i>On the Scene.</i>

202
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:29,620
"Sex and Power in America."

203
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:35,500
<i>Chip Johnson. On the Scene.</i>

204
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,710
You're everywhere, Chip.

205
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,630
Not anymore.

206
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:43,340
We'll do this.

207
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,130
Now you're mine.

208
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:51,180
Let's see who dyes their hair now.

209
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,930
How do you like this? Whoop!

210
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:56,940
Oh! I'm sorry, Chip. I chopped it.

211
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,310
Oh, that's okay.

212
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,730
I'm on the scene today.

213
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:04,030
I just had my hair dyed last week
and my teeth whitened,

214
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,990
and I'm feeling really good about myself.

215
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:09,070
So good that I'm gonna
hop on over here.

216
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:11,700
Oh, hello, darling.
Who colors your hair?

217
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,080
Oh, I saw you on television.

218
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,120
Oh, have you, now?

219
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,210
Oh, yes, I watch you
at 6:00 every single night.

220
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:19,210
Oh, that's so funny.
I was just wondering who dyes your hair.

221
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:20,250
You okay, Bill?

222
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:22,250
What?

223
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,670
Yes, sir.

224
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,170
Our kids from
the mentor program are here.

225
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:26,170
I want you to give them a tour.

226
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,760
Uh, okay. Which kids?

227
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,140
Yours, mine, and John Jr.'s.
We're all doing it.

228
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:34,560
Now, John Jr. and I have a meeting,
so they're waiting for you in the lobby.

229
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,850
Oh, and the two boys are
coming hunting with us Saturday.

230
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,730
Your brother has some guns
waiting at the store for them.

231
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:44,110
I told him that you would
pick them up after work.

232
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,650
Thanks, Bill.

233
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,080
Hey, Bill.

234
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,910
I thought the program
started on Monday.

235
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Mr. Jacoby thought it would be prudent
for us to get acquainted with your facility

236
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,590
prior to the actual
commencement date.

237
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,920
Sarah Sheldon, class of 2009.

238
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:08,420
Your father-in-law's my mentor.

239
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:09,880
Donald Choo.

240
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:12,970
Hi, Donald. Hi, Sarah.
Nice to meet you.

241
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:16,470
I don't know what you're up to,
but this is going to be a fast tour.

242
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,560
Follow me.

243
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:30,110
Uh, the question we're asked the most is
what's inside the safety deposit boxes.

244
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,110
Well, some of these boxes haven't
been opened for over 20 years,

245
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,410
so, uh, it's anybody's guess.

246
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,910
And, um, the people who own
the boxes have the only key.

247
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:38,080
You ever go through them,
see what people are hiding?

248
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,160
He just told you
he doesn't have the key.

249
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,370
Oh, come on.
There's no master key?

250
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,790
Anyway, that's the end of the tour.

251
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,050
- Can't we see the safe?
- Shut up, kid.

252
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:50,630
We ran your financials,
and we think, potentially,

253
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,880
you could be a good fit for us.

254
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:53,800
Great.

255
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:55,550
So what's next?

256
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,810
We'll fly out later this week
and approve the site.

257
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,810
And, of course,
there's a sort of orientation

258
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:01,980
where you spend a day
at one of our main stores.

259
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,980
Just to ensure you know exactly
what business you're getting into.

260
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,270
You could bring your wife.

261
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,910
Oh, that'd be great.
She'd love that.

262
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:15,370
Since she'll be
your partner in this venture,

263
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:16,990
we do require one meeting
with her anyway,

264
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,950
so kill two birds with one stone.

265
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,540
Well, she won't be involved
in the daily operations.

266
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,540
Oh, it's a formality.

267
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:26,500
She's listed as co-owner
of... all of your assets.

268
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:29,250
I know.

269
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,340
Pretty sweet, aren't they?

270
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,130
They're delicious.

271

Is that it?

286
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,910
Do you like them?

287
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,750
They're fine.

288
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,830
Would you ever wear them?

289
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:08,170
Sure.

290
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,550
Do you ever wear them?

291
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:13,130
That's gonna be 28.75.
Do you want them or not?

292
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:17,090
Tired of flirting?

293
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,430
Actually...

294
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,100
I bought them for you.

295
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:34,950
Hey, I know you.

296
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:37,320
Where do I know you from?

297
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,370
Freedom Bank.
I'm on the billboards.

298
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:41,410
No, I know. I know.

299
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:43,000
You're Sargeant Thompson's brother.

300
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,580
Yeah.
I went to Tate with you guys.

301
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,460
I'm Charlie Sherman.

302
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,500
Oh, man, your brother
was my hero in high school.

303
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,590
Goddamn rocket for an arm.

304
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:55,220
So how is Sarge, huh?
He still in town?

305
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,760
Yeah. He lives in Ferndale.

306
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,260
Whoa.

307
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:02,180
Yeah. With his boyfriend.

308
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:05,270
Paul. He's a great guy.
Teaches math at Tate.

309
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,690
Sugar?

310
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:14,690
Mark, you seen my brother?

311
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,610
I think he's upstairs.

312
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,360
Thanks.
You got it.

313
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,990
Why don't you just tell him
that you think hunting is wrong?

314
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,410
The man has a stuffed
bear in his bedroom.

315
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,670
You're already his son-in-law.
It doesn't matter if he likes you.

316
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,580
He signs my paychecks.

317
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:32,380
What is this?

318
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,590
That's the Tate mentor program.

319
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:35,840
They sent out invitations?

320
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,760
Yeah. They want me
on the board or something.

321
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,390
Been a meeting about it
a couple weeks ago.

322
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:42,350
Why? Are you joining?

323
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:46,350
Sanderson roped me into it yesterday.

324
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:48,440
He didn't tell me
that you were doing it.

325
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,560
Yeah.

326
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:52,980
Wow.

327
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:56,400
<i>Join Chip Johnson,
On the Scene, tonight at 6 on 11.</i>

328
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,780
You mind if I borrow
your video camera?

329
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,400
Next one's yours, Bill.

330
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:41,860
Keep your eyes open this time.
Okay? Don't forget to aim.

331
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,620
This sucks.

332
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,700
I'm fucking wet,
I'm fucking tired.

333
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,290
No to mention deaf.

334
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,500
That thing
sounds like a giant ass.

335
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:57,170
Shut up.
You'll scare the ducks.

336
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:01,050
What the fuck?
You closed your eyes.

337
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:02,470
John, I did not.
I squinted at the sun.

338
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:05,600
You did, too. What a waste.

339
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,970
Dad...

340
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:12,560
Get the duck.

341
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,320
I was talking to the dog.

342
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:22,320
Oh.

343
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,610
I knew that.

344
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:26,490
I got a little cramp in my back.

345
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:31,120
Get the duck. Get the duck.

346
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:36,500
All right, get the damn duck.

347
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:12,710
If this were a hundred years ago,
your family would be dead of starvation.

348
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:16,000
Come on, boys. Let's go.

349
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,650
How'd it go?

350
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:39,270
Uh, fine.

351
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,940
Did you get anything?
Uh, no.

352
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,570
What's in your vest?

353
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:43,900
Nothing.

354
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,320
It's a duck.

355
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:48,910
What are you gonna do with it?

356
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,410
Bury it.
Where?

357
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:52,290
In the backyard.

358
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,550
I think he knows.

359
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:02,590
He looked really uptight.

360
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:04,300
He always looks that way.

361
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,340
Everything makes Bill uptight.

362
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:08,640
Blow jobs make Bill uptight.

363
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,390
Okay, I don't need that visual.

364
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:12,680
No, I swear.

365
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,230
He has a complex about the little acorn.

366
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,390
No.
Yeah.

367
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,390
The acorn?

368
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,940
I swear to God,
that's what it looks like.

369
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:21,070
No. No, it doesn't.

370
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:26,200
It's too bad, too, because I hear
that his brother is huge, like you.

371
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:35,540
You know what I'm gonna do?

372
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,120
I'm gonna kill her. After I kill him.

373
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:39,120
Calm down.

374
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:41,040
<i>Calm down? My wife is screwing
the On the Scene news guy.</i>

375
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:42,290
You don't know
that was him for sure.

376
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:45,170
Come on!
The hair, the hair, the hair!

377
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:46,300
It could've been anyone.

378
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,260
Yeah, anyone. Anyone except me!

379
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:50,140
Anyone who works out all the time.

380
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:53,720
God, he's in my bed,
he's in my shirt.

381
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:57,020
Why aren't you
into blow jobs?

382
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,690
She said I'm not into blow jobs.

383
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:01,650
Listen to me,
and I want this to be known.

384
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:04,530
I am. I love blow jobs.

385
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:07,280
I am Mr. Blow Job Aficionado.

386
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,900
Must run in the family.

387
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:10,490
Paul, can you stop being
a fag for half a second?

388
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:12,160
I'll try.

389
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,990
Little acorn.

390
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,200
All right, that's enough.

391
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:16,790
Oh, my God.

392
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:20,000
What if she's planning
on leaving me for him?

393
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:25,090
I'm gonna go get my gun,

394
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,590
and I am gonna go kill him.

395
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:29,680
Okay, you're not gonna
kill anyone, so just calm down.

396
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,350
I am calm.

397
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:49,150
Hey, did you bury the duck?

398
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,410
The duck?
The duck is right here.

399
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:54,120
Quack quack.

400
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,450
Mm-hmm. Look
who's on the scene today.

401
00:23:58,290 --> 00:23:59,410
You spied on me.

402
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,670
That's right, baby,
and I got it all on tape.

403
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:02,620
That's illegal.

404
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:05,210
No, smoking pot is illegal.

405
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:07,170
You cheated on me.

406
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:09,420
That is a complete
invasion of my privacy.

407
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:10,840
Are you kidding me?

408
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,130
It was in our bedroom.

409
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,050
I can't believe you would do that to me.

410
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,430
Wait a second. That's what
I'm supposed to be saying to you.

411
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:17,970
- Give me the tape.
- No.

412
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,930
- I want it.
- No, the tape is mine.

413
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,020
Give me the tape!

414
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,310
No.

415
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:25,310
<i>Join me later. I'm on the scene
at a local children's hospital,</i>

416
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,150
<i>raising money for a special cause.</i>

417
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:28,730
We have 30 seconds.

418
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,320
Where is cancer kid?

419
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,660
Over there.
His name's Charlie.

420
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:35,570
He doesn't look that sick to me.

421
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,530
He's had leukemia since he was 4.

422
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,700
His prognosis is grim.

423
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,620
Tell him to tone down the smile.

424
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:46,290
- Fine.
- Did my agent call?

425
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,300
On the scene! On the scene!

426
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,720
Always on the scene.
I'll give you on the scene.

427
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,640
Action team. Hey!

428
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,390
I saw you, and I'm watching you!
I'm watching you!

429
00:24:57,430 --> 00:25:01,270
Video camera, one watch.

430
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:08,770
A wallet, with a Chip Johnson doll.

431
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,030
Can I make my phone call?

432
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:18,950
Your brother's here.

433
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,200
We watched the tape.

434
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:27,000
That acorn thing is harsh.

435
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,920
<i>I saw you, and I'm watching you!</i>

436
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,380
Wow, a deranged fan.

437
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,920
Is this the first time something
like this has happened to you?

438
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:35,090
Yes, it is, Rick.

439
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,390
You see that hair? He dyes it.

440
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:39,510
It looks like it.

441
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,060
You think he's good-looking?

442
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,810
Why are you watching this?

443
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,190
Do you think he's good-looking?

444
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:55,820
Bill, he's not better than you.

445
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,780
We have that mentor thing at 7.

446
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:03,580
Get some sleep.

447
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:06,080
Deranged fan.

448
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:12,710
Oh, my God.

449
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,510
All right, give it to me straight.

450
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,470
How many deranged fan jokes?

451
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:25,810
No one saw anything.
Come on, we're late.

452
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:29,860
Wait, I'm just gonna take a second.

453
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,440
Sure.

454
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:50,630
Oh, my God, it's him.

455
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:51,630
It's the deranged fan!

456
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,250
Deranged fan.

457
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:30,080
All right.
It's a good-looking group, huh?

458
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:31,130
Mind if I get this started?

459
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:35,130
Hey, I, for one, think this is going
to be an excellent program,

460
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:38,130
but I want to make sure
you think so, too,

461
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:40,590
so what do you say,
is this gonna be a great program?

462
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,260
Huh?

463
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:45,890
Yeah-ha-ha!

464
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:52,940
I cannot believe
you kicked that guy's ass.

465
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,400
Local news usually sucks.

466
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,070
Listen.

467
00:27:56,150 --> 00:28:00,200
Um, no offense, but, um...

468
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,740
I think that you should
maybe choose someone else.

469
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:06,660
Because this isn't the best time
for me to be mentoring somebody, okay?

470
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:09,330
What are you talking about?
This is the perfect time.

471
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:12,790
Why don't you have John Jr.
or Mr. Jacoby mentor you?

472
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,540
Would you want to spend time
with either one of them?

473
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,260
Come on.
Is this about your wife?

474
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,970
No, it's about more
than my wife. It's about...

475
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:24,140
Don't worry about your wife.
We'll get her back.

476
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:26,060
We aren't gonna do anything.

477
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,270
Drop it now.

478
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:31,140
Hi, John. Sarah. John. Donald.

479
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:32,190
Hey, Choo.

480
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:34,900
Bill, you're going to make
a schedule for all three kids.

481
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,690
We agreed it would simplify things.

482
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:39,530
That's right. They'll report to you
at the same time every day.

483
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:42,150
No way. Bill's my mentor.

484
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,950
This isn't a group project.
All right?

485
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:46,780
I don't want to be all tied
to you and choo-choo.

486
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:49,370
Okay? So you can forget about it.

487
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:51,370
We're fine.
We're not scheduling.

488
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,410
Fine.

489
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,750
All right, Bill.
I'll see you tomorrow after school.

490
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:58,130
Don't go deadbeat on me.

491
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:09,140
Gonna be a great program, huh?

492
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,690
Hey.
Hey.

493
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,320
How are you?

494
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,910
I'm good. You want a doughnut?

495
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:26,410
Can I show you something?

496
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,540
Of course. What's up?

497
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,160
You promise you won't be mad at me?

498
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:32,200
No.

499
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:44,680
<i>No, I swear. He's got a complex
about the little acorn.</i>

500
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:48,260
I thought you should know.

501
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:52,140
It does not look like an acorn.

502
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:54,810
Everybody got it in email this morning.

503
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:57,770
I had Donna delete it from Mr. Jacoby's.

504
00:29:57,810 --> 00:29:58,860
Oh.

505
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,400
He can barely use
the internet anyway.

506
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,820
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

507
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,210
Did my father see it?

508
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,670
No.
John Jr.

509
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:17,960
Not yet.

510
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,380
Where'd you get that?

511
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:23,130
Oh, please, I know
where your stash is.

512
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:28,470
My life is ruined.

513
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:29,930
Don't exaggerate.

514
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:32,560
I'm in a sex video. That's porn.

515
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,690
Chip is gonna go into cardiac arrest.

516
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:38,350
Screw Chip.

517
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,570
He's a celebrity.
This could ruin his career.

518
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:45,110
<i>On the Scene News 11
doesn't exactly qualify as celebrity.</i>

519
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:49,070
Stop eating that.
It's not good for you.

520
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:52,660
Where are you going?

521
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,790
To talk to Chip about your little tape.

522
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:08,760
<i># Come in close, come in tight #</i>

523
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,850
<i># Taste my neck and take a bite #</i>

524
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:14,390
<i># Be the vampire saints you are #</i>

525
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:17,690
<i># Stab it right into my heart #</i>

526
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:19,350
<i># Cut my skin upon your teeth #</i>

527
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,980
Bill, what are you doing?

528
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:24,860
Put the gun down!
Hey, news guy!

529
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:29,820
We're on the scene. It's your house!

530
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:31,030
Bill, you're gonna get arrested!

531
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:33,330
Won't be the first time.

532
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:36,830
Bill, you go home!

533
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:38,500
This is not about you!

534
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:42,630
Get...

535
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:46,260
Yeah, let's see what Chip
has to say for himself.

536
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,590
I don't know why you're blaming Chip
for your tape.

537
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:51,180
How long you been lying to me?

538
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,340
Oh, please. What about you?

539
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:53,890
I never lied to you.
Really?

540
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:55,100
Yeah.
Oh.

541
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,180
Well, you've never managed to clip
a feather, let alone bring home a duck,

542
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:59,270
but you just hit two 4-inch targets
from 30 yards.

543
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,480
Who's the liar?

544
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,690
What the hell's going on out here?

545
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:04,730
It's me.
I can see that.

546
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:06,860
I filed a restraining order
against you.

547
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,440
Well, then, congratulations.

548
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:10,400
Looks like you got
your top story for tonight.

549
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:12,240
This is not gonna look good.

550
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,700
I don't care how it looks.

551
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:16,830
I can't be involved in this.
Take your husband and leave.

552
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:19,460
Don't speak to me like I'm
some groupie you just fucked.

553
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,920
Honey!
I just want you off my property.

554
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,130
- Give me that towel!
- Get your hands off me!

555
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:25,590
I knew you dyed your hair!

556
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:27,250
Bill, cut it out!
Apologize to her!

557
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,130
Bill!
You are gonna get arrested!

558
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:30,670
Let me see that hair!

559
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,510
Chip Johnson, Action News!

560
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:35,890
- Phony, apologize!
- Mm-mm.

561
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:38,350
<i>You apologize! Apologize!</i>

562
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:41,230
Jesus Christ.

563
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:44,270
<i>Your brother's here, Acorn.</i>

564
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:51,860
Good morning.

565
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:53,740
Good morning.

566
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,580
Hey, you want to come swim?

567
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:02,080
The pool's open before school.

568
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,790
Friends and family are welcome.

569
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:05,710
It's 5:00 in the morning.

570
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:08,920
So? You going back to sleep?

571
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,380
Sergeant says you swim every day.

572
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:16,390
Don't you remember
how liberating it feels to be in the water?

573
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:19,970
The best way to drown out the noise.

574
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:24,810
Come on.

575
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:27,190
Who needs an occasional escape
from their reality?

576
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:29,860
I'll grab you a suit.

577
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:34,660
You ready?

578
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:49,090
All right. Come on, big guy.
Let's rock it.

579
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,520
I know how this entire debacle
must look,

580
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:53,860
and I'm sorry if I have
embarrassed you in any way.

581
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:57,110
Bill, you're dangerously close
to losing everything you've worked for.

582
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,450
I understand that.

583
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:01,700
Pull it together and resolve your personal
problems in private like a gentleman.

584
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:04,410
- Yes, sir.
- We're having a family dinner tomorrow.

585
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,790
I'll expect the two of you
to be there, together.

586
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:09,040
- She has a restraining order.
- Work it out.

587
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,830
We'll be there together.

588
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,190
- Hey!
- Hey!

589
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,440
How are you?

590
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:39,490
Actually, I think this is the best one.
The location is perfect.

591
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:41,450
Yeah, the traffic pattern's great.

592
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:43,120
Oh, and you can do a drive-through.

593
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,040
That's a great idea.

594
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,500
Hey, apologize!

595
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:48,660
Apologize!

596
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,330
Sorry!

597
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,380
That was strange.

598
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:58,840
Yeah. Anyway...
You know, that's the space.

599
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:02,300
Oh, when do we get to meet Jessica?

600
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,270
Uh, Jessica?

601
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:08,640
Well, actually, she, uh...

602
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:12,270
she just called me. She's sick.
She has the flu, and it's pretty bad.

603
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:14,570
But you'll meet her when we
come up to spend the day with you.

604
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:16,610
Right.

605
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:19,190
Well, we got some time to kill.
Maybe we can see your offices.

606
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,860
I would love to see your operation.

607
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:22,910
<i>I read about it
in Entrepreneur Magazine.</i>

608
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:25,490
Your father-in-law sounds
like a pretty amazing fellow.

609
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,450
Good idea, Jim.

610
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:30,370
Yeah, Jim, that's a great idea.

611
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:34,040
Um, yeah. Yeah, sure.

612
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:40,010
Take your time. Take your time.

613
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:41,260
Come on, Jim.

614
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,890
Come on in.

615
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:44,890
- Just come on...
- You're really fast.

616
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:47,010
Hey, Bill.

617
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:50,680
Um...

618
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:52,600
This is Jim and, uh, Jane.

619
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:54,560
This is my student I'm mentoring.

620
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:56,520
It's an alumni-participation program.

621
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:58,230
That's fantastic.
Nice.

622
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,150
We love our family
being part of the community.

623
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,910
You guys are family?

624
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:06,410
Well, hopefully, when Bill becomes part
of SweetSweet, it'll feel that way.

625
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:07,450
Doughnuts?

626
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,830
I love the chocolate-covered ones
with the vanilla.

627
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:15,210
Oh, you should visit our Madison store
when Bill and Jessica come next week.

628
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:16,630
I'd love to.

629
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:27,810
Just... Just... Just a second.
Excuse me.

630
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:30,640
Sarah, I'm really busy right now.

631
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,560
Donald told me
you went hunting last weekend.

632
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,480
Why was I intentionally excluded?

633
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,060
- What, you wanna kill little birds?
- It's discriminatory.

634
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:40,320
Let me tell you something.
Life is discriminatory. Deal with it.

635
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:50,580
So is this where the tour starts?

636
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,750
They don't give tours here.
It's against the rules.

637
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:54,540
Oh.

638
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:57,170
Well, we don't want anyone
to break the rules.

639
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:59,130
Be quiet.

640
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,420
Doughnuts?

641
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:05,260
I have to go back to work now.

642
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,510
We're supposed to spend
five hours a week together.

643
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:09,760
I'll call you.

644
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:27,950
What are you doing?

645
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:29,620
I'm fixing your head!

646
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:31,620
No, no, no!
You come down from there!

647
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,700
You own this place!

648
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:35,910
You can't have your face all saggy!

649
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,670
I'll get somebody to fix it in the morning!

650
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:41,670
Come on! Get down!

651
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:45,630
We'll go do something!

652
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:51,310
What exactly do you want
from this mentor thing?

653
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:53,720
An A.

654
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:56,350
Hey, there.
You guys need anything?

655
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,270
Uh, no, thank you.

656
00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:01,070
Actually, uh, we do need something.
He needs a suit.

657
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:04,030
And, uh, you got anything
besides these lame plum smugglers?

658
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,660
I'll see what I can do.

659
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,830
How are you ever gonna meet
any new chicks if you don't work it?

660
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:13,870
For your information,
I'm still married.

661
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:17,620
The only way to get the old one back
is to get a new one she's jealous of.

662
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:18,870
Yeah, when you're 15.

663
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:22,460
These are cool.
A lot of guys are wearing these.

664
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,380
Yeah, those are cool.

665
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,010
Do you like to swim?

666
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:28,630
Yeah. Yeah, I like to swim.

667
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,090
You should come sometime.

668
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:32,050
It's great exercise,

669
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,850
and, you know, we can get breakfast
or something afterwards.

670
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:38,060
Well, look, you guys decide you want
any of that stuff, my name's Laura.

671
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:39,940
Just give my name at the register.

672
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:42,230
All right.
Thank you, Laura.

673
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:46,780
My brother owns this place,
so try and behave.

674
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:48,990
Wait. Wait. Uh...

675
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:52,070
"This is going to be a great program" guy
is your brother?

676
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:57,830
You own a bank. He owns this place.
Can I get the family discount?

677
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:59,830
- Let's play it by ear.
- This is a great program.

678
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:03,210
Hey, deranged fan guy. Apologize!

679
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,050
- Bird watching?
- Duck hunting.

680
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:18,850
No one can even tell
it's you in the video.

681
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:21,690
And, besides, you're more popular now
than ever before.

682
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:27,030
I mean, everybody loves the whole
"deranged fan, apologize" thing.

683
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:29,150
I'm glad you're amused.

684
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:31,240
What do you think would happen
to Brian Williams' career

685
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,240
if he were caught on tape
with someone else's wife?

686
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,530
Who the hell's that?

687
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:35,660
Never mind.

688
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:39,250
The point is,
it would be O-V-E-R.

689
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:42,880
Don't be dramatic, all right?
Look at Paris Hilton.

690
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,630
Clinton, for that matter.

691
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:47,380
This could be the thing
that gets you a national spot.

692
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:49,300
I don't know.

693
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,680
Maybe I should hire my own PR person.

694
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,930
Don't you have to go to work?

695
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:57,810
Yeah. I gotta go.

696
00:40:57,890 --> 00:40:59,810
See ya.

697
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:08,030
Hello.

698
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:11,070
Hey, it's me.

699
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:13,160
Oh. What's up?

700
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,660
<i>Uh, I just, uh...</i>

701
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:18,660
I just want to know if you want me
to pick you up for dinner tomorrow night.

702
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:19,870
Yeah, that's fine.

703
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,340
What's that noise?

704
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:30,550
Oh, it's, uh...
Sergeant's watching TV.

705
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:32,170
Oh. How is Sarge?

706
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,930
Uh, he's good. You know...
You know him. He's always happy.

707
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:36,680
That's true.

708
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,310
<i>Tell him I said hi.
I gotta stop by the store.</i>

709
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:41,640
My dad said it's, like, totally amazing.

710
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,600
Oh, gross.

711
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,600
Come on.
You have a great ass.

712
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:46,860
What?

713
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,150
Nothing. I was just...

714
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:51,940
I was just, uh, thinking
how great your body is.

715
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:53,860
You were thinking about my butt?

716
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,530
It's just when you said gross...

717
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:58,240
Oh, so I said gross,
and you thought of my butt.

718
00:41:58,330 --> 00:42:01,200
<i>No. That's what you say
when you check it out sometimes.</i>

719
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:08,920
<i>Bill, I can see you.</i>

720
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,880
What the hell are you doing?

721
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,380
I need some clothes.

722
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:18,850
Jesus Christ, Bill.

723
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:21,680
I'm sorry.

724
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:24,980
I just don't understand
what you see in that guy.

725
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:31,900
Stop spying on me.

726
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,660
I'll pick you up at 7 tomorrow night.

727
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:42,120
Tell your little friend I saw him.

728
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:07,690
The most important thing is that
you treat tomorrow like a first date.

729
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:11,270
All right? You gotta buy some new clothes,
and you're gonna bring her flowers.

730
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,860
It's gonna make her feel
like you really care.

731
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:16,200
- What's going on?
- We're upgrading the package.

732
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:07,250
Ahh!

733
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:11,380
What are you doing here?

734
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:14,460
Taking a shower.

735
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,920
Does this count as part
of the five hours per week?

736
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:21,590
Would you write me a note
so I don't get detention for being late?

737
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:25,560
No.

738
00:44:27,730 --> 00:44:30,270
Hey. I guess I'll see you
after school.

739
00:44:30,310 --> 00:44:32,190
I won't be there.

740
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:34,690
I have to buy some new clothes.
Sorry.

741
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:36,730
Cool. We'll go to the mall.

742
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:39,780
- Hey, Mr. Rose.
- Aren't you late for class?

743
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:42,490
Bill's signing a note for me.

744
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:44,280
Oh, really?

745
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:47,950
Um, well, that's not exactly
how it works.

746
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:56,250
You're really lucky
I don't report you.

747
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:58,760
- Come on. He's my mentor.
- Look, move it.

748
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,670
All right. Bill, I'll see you later.

749
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,890
Tuck in the shirt.

750
00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:13,460
She's hot.

751
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:15,870
I'm shopping for clothes.

752
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:18,130
You need a new strategy. Y...

753
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:20,050
If your wife saw you with her,
she'd think twice

754
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:21,710
<i>about hitting
the On the Scene news guy again.</i>

755
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,630
Let's say that I buy into your theory.

756
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:25,550
Who am I gonna
go out on a date with?

757
00:46:25,630 --> 00:46:28,550
Unlike you, I have a plan.
You can borrow my girlfriend.

758
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,930
Oh, right.

759
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:35,850
Look at him.

760
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:39,150
He needs your help.

761
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:44,240
He needs new clothes and a hot chick
to get his wife back.

762
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,950
I wonder who thought of that.

763
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:48,910
Come on. What?
I'll pay you a hundred bucks.

764
00:46:48,990 --> 00:46:50,620
Where'd you get a hundred bucks?

765
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:52,240
I happen to have an allowance.

766
00:46:52,330 --> 00:46:54,500
Fine.

767
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:56,870
I'll get him some clothes.

768
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,960
<i>So that On the Scene loser's
jammin' his wife,</i>

769
00:47:03,010 --> 00:47:04,840
but he's got a date with her tonight.

770
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:08,550
Yeah, I saw the video.
What's up with his hair?

771
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,140
You... I can hear you.

772
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:12,010
You know,
I sold her those underwear.

773
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:15,270
- That's hot.
- I'll bet you it was his fault.

774
00:47:15,350 --> 00:47:17,190
It's not my fault.
Oh, really?

775
00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:18,980
When was the last pair of panties
you bought her?

776
00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:22,110
I'm a fat fuck.

777
00:47:22,190 --> 00:47:24,110
I love panties.

778
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:26,360
I bet you don't even know
what kind she wears.

779
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,410
I see it every day...

780
00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:30,780
women
investing hope in underwear.

781
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:32,700
I bought you those pink furry ones.

782
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:36,040
- I returned them.
- I would never forget how sexy you are.

783
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,790
You know, you're kind of creepy.

784
00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:40,540
- But only kind of. Right? Hey.
- Stop.

785
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:49,470
That is hot.

786
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:55,100
Thanks for helping out.

787
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:57,180
I needed the money.

788
00:47:57,270 --> 00:48:00,770
You know, this would look
really hot on you.

789
00:48:00,850 --> 00:48:02,820
I'm not trying on underwear for you.

790
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:04,650
What's your hang-up
with underwear?

791
00:48:04,730 --> 00:48:06,780
I mean, it's just like
wearing a bathing suit.

792
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:10,360
Oh, really? Well, then,
why don't you model some for me?

793
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:16,370
I'll model for you, you come on
a date with me Friday night.

794
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:20,750
I get to choose the underwear.

795
00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:22,880
All right.
Let's go.

796
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:41,650
Bill.

797
00:48:41,730 --> 00:48:44,110
It's no big deal.

798
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:51,570
You ready to face my dad?

799
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:55,620
I face him every day. It'll be fine.

800
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:57,580
I'll pretend I'm sick,
and we'll leave early.

801
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:03,000
You ready?

802
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:05,540
The question is are you ready?

803
00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:07,170
Yep.

804
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:09,670
I don't know.
I don't think you can handle this.

805
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,590
I think it might be
a little too sexy for you.

806
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,300
Let's see it, kid.

807
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:14,640
All right.

808
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:19,180
<i># Hey #</i>

809
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:21,350
<i># Everybody get naked #</i>

810
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:26,440
<i># Shake it, shake it, shake it #</i>

811
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:29,400
Oh, yeah! Ride the pony.

812
00:49:31,070 --> 00:49:33,070
<i># Shake it, shake it, shake it #</i>

813
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:35,320
You know you want it. You know it.

814
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,660
Tap it! Tap it!

815
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:41,210
<i># Mercy, shake it, shake it, shake it #</i>

816
00:49:41,290 --> 00:49:43,080
You're so weird.

817
00:49:43,170 --> 00:49:46,250
<i># I love you #</i>

818
00:49:46,290 --> 00:49:48,000
Ride the pony!

819
00:49:48,050 --> 00:49:52,010
<i># Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah #</i>

820
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:55,300
Duck is perfect, Mom.

821
00:49:55,390 --> 00:49:58,180
My favorite is the acorn squash.

822
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:01,390
It's in season now.

823
00:50:02,890 --> 00:50:04,810
It's nice.

824
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:06,060
Oh-oh-oh-oh.

825
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:10,990
I missed that one.

826
00:50:11,030 --> 00:50:12,570
It's good luck.

827
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:15,280
- You have to swallow it.
- That's right. Swallow it.

828
00:50:19,030 --> 00:50:21,040
It's all yours.

829
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:24,160
You can't disrespect the hunt.

830
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:30,250
Swallow it.

831
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:32,380
No.

832
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:34,800
Yes.

833
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:37,090
No.

834
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:39,220
Swallow it!

835
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:41,350
No!
Swallow it.

836
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:43,640
No!
Swallow it.

837
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:44,980
No.
Eat it!

838
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:47,350
- No!
- Swallow it, you ingrate!

839
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,610
John, please! We're at the dinner table.

840
00:50:49,690 --> 00:50:53,690
I'm sorry, okay?
But he has absolutely no respect

841
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:55,950
for this family
and everything we've done for him.

842
00:50:55,990 --> 00:50:58,870
I mean, he wouldn't even have a job
if it weren't for you!

843
00:50:58,950 --> 00:51:01,240
He's executive vice president.

844
00:51:01,290 --> 00:51:03,750
Executive vice president? Of what?

845
00:51:03,830 --> 00:51:05,580
Human resources?

846
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:08,710
A position that we created
specifically for him!

847
00:51:08,790 --> 00:51:10,460
Shut up, John!

848
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:14,380
Since Bill's been at the bank,
unemployment claims are down 41%.

849
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:17,630
That's because he never fires anyone!

850
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:20,300
And why are you defending him?

851
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:24,560
Pathetic. Unbelievable.

852
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:26,810
If you were my wife, I would leave you.

853
00:51:26,890 --> 00:51:29,310
No one is leaving.

854
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:31,190
No one's leaving.

855
00:51:31,270 --> 00:51:33,900
No one is leaving anyone.

856
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:36,700
I'm running for mayor.

857
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:38,280
What?

858
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:40,240
I'm announcing it at the club picnic,

859
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:44,410
and I expect all of you
to behave like a family.

860
00:51:45,830 --> 00:51:49,210
Now, does everyone understand
what I'm saying? Jessica?

861
00:51:49,290 --> 00:51:50,920
Yes, Daddy.

862
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,300
Now, who wants to get the fireworks?

863
00:51:54,590 --> 00:51:56,340
I'll get them.

864
00:51:58,090 --> 00:52:00,640
Just don't screw it up.

865
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,260
You know, when my dad
finds out you made a tape,

866
00:52:03,310 --> 00:52:06,560
and it's on the internet,
he's gonna freak.

867
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,520
Well, maybe he won't find out.

868
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,350
He's running for mayor.

869
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:12,480
Mm-hmm. And I told you.

870
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:18,200
Let's get coffee.

871
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:20,280
No. No, I'm too stressed.

872
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:23,530
Come on.
It'll be a good distraction.

873
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:25,290
Yeah, all right.

874
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:28,080
It's gonna be okay. Come on.

875
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:31,880
What happened to the girl who didn't
give a shit about what anybody thought?

876
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:35,710
Where is the Jess who used to go
commando under her uniform

877
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,630
and flash me outside of science class,

878
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:40,630
even though Jenny Bradley
called her a slut?

879
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,800
And Jenny Bradley was a slut!

880
00:52:42,890 --> 00:52:44,600
Bill?

881
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:46,720
Hey!
Hey!

882
00:52:46,810 --> 00:52:48,310
What the heck are you doing here?

883
00:52:48,390 --> 00:52:50,980
Um, just, you know,
having a little late-night coffee.

884
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:52,150
Really?

885
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:01,320
So you coming by the store tomorrow?

886
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:05,280
Uh, maybe tomorrow night after work.

887
00:53:05,330 --> 00:53:06,700
Yeah?

888
00:53:06,790 --> 00:53:08,700
Make sure you ask for me.

889
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:10,120
Lucy.

890
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,620
Yeah, exactly.

891
00:53:11,670 --> 00:53:13,960
So I'll see you then.

892
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:20,880
- Lucy works at the mall, doesn't she?
- Mm-hmm.

893
00:53:20,970 --> 00:53:23,050
You know what I
could really go for right now?

894
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:24,430
A doughnut.

895
00:53:25,390 --> 00:53:26,640
What?

896
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:28,890
Fresh out of the oven.
Milk-chocolate icing.

897
00:53:28,970 --> 00:53:31,020
Think how successful Krispy Kreme is.

898
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:32,940
Yeah. They are.

899
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:35,310
If we had one of those, we would never
have to worry about your father again.

900
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:36,820
What are you talking about?

901
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:38,860
Doughnut franchises
are extremely lucrative.

902
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:41,780
Yeah, but who the hell
wants a doughnut franchise?

903
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:44,240
Who the hell
wants a doughnut franchise?

904
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:51,960
Bill, listen, you gotta do
something about the tape.

905
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,790
What can I do?

906
00:53:54,830 --> 00:53:57,750
Seven million teens
have probably already downloaded it.

907
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:59,250
Oh, God.

908
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:02,680
I feel sick.

909
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:07,430
I don't know what he's doing here.

910
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:12,100
It's okay. Go on.

911
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:14,060
Go on. I understand.

912
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:17,230
I don't think I can handle another
"deranged fan" with him anyway.

913
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:21,440
Are you seeing that girl?

914
00:54:21,530 --> 00:54:23,700
I told you, I just met her.

915
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:26,990
She obviously likes you.

916
00:54:29,490 --> 00:54:31,370
Do you like her?

917
00:54:34,210 --> 00:54:36,630
She sells underwear.
She's nice.

918
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:50,220
Okay.
Okay. Bye.

919
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:08,370
What are you doing?

920
00:55:08,450 --> 00:55:10,030
Pretty good, huh?

921
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:12,080
This isn't a competition, Bill.

922
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:14,620
Okay.

923
00:55:14,710 --> 00:55:16,920
Oh, I gotta stop smoking that chronic.

924
00:55:19,210 --> 00:55:21,340
Nice mentoring, Bill!

925
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,590
Roser the poser looks pissed.

926
00:55:26,550 --> 00:55:29,550
He probably couldn't punch out
his algorithm this morning.

927
00:55:32,310 --> 00:55:34,930
Was she jealous?

928
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:36,890
Yeah, she was.

929
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:39,360
I knew it. I knew it.

930
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,400
It's only a matter of time now.

931
00:55:44,990 --> 00:55:47,450
- Is she coming to see the SweetSweets?
- I don't think so.

932
00:55:47,530 --> 00:55:50,070
Yes, she is.

933
00:55:51,910 --> 00:55:54,200
It's never gonna work.
Of course it is.

934
00:55:59,330 --> 00:56:01,460
This is my wife.

935
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:03,380
Nice to meet you.

936
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:05,050
Likewise.

937
00:56:06,470 --> 00:56:08,220
All righty, then.

938
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:10,300
Let's get started.

939
00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:13,100
And now we put
the topping on them.

940
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:15,770
We got glazed,
chocolate, and sprinkles.

941
00:56:15,850 --> 00:56:17,270
What the hell are you doing?

942
00:56:17,310 --> 00:56:19,350
I'm sorry. It looked so good.

943
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,020
Hey, Lucy tried it, too.

944
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:24,530
- Who's Lucy?
- I don't know.

945
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:27,610
He has an imaginary friend... Lucy.

946
00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:31,570
Well, we're gonna have
to throw all that away now.

947
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:33,450
I'll just take it home.

948
00:56:33,530 --> 00:56:35,700
- No. That's against company policy.
- What?

949
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:38,710
- Frosting can't leave the building?
- It's a secret recipe.

950
00:56:40,210 --> 00:56:42,670
All right. If you're gonna
throw it away, here. Try it.

951
00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:44,340
It's good.

952
00:56:49,630 --> 00:56:50,970
Ahh.

953
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:55,010
I'm not eating sugar right now.

954
00:56:57,060 --> 00:56:59,020
I'll take you guys over
to the boxing section,

955
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:01,020
and then, uh,
set you up at the register.

956
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:07,860
I'll have six chocolate
and two vanilla and three cherry.

957
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:10,860
No, make that two chocolate.

958
00:57:10,950 --> 00:57:13,660
She looks a little young
to be his wife.

959
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:15,740
Jane, who gives a shit,
all right?

960
00:57:15,830 --> 00:57:17,700
We need to move
some of these franchises.

961
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:19,620
He could be a huge asset to us.

962
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:21,580
Don't cuss at me.

963
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:24,000
I am trying to protect
your interest also.

964
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,670
I'm sorry.

965
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:30,220
I just think sometimes
you have unreasonable expectations.

966
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:33,010
There you go.

967
00:57:33,090 --> 00:57:34,890
Actually, I said six chocolate.

968
00:57:34,970 --> 00:57:37,140
Maybe you should consider
laying off the chocolate.

969
00:57:38,470 --> 00:57:41,600
Hey. He's just kidding.
He wants the chocolate ones for himself.

970
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:44,400
Okay, so that will be, uh, 8.63, please.

971
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:46,230
I already gave you a coupon
for the free dozen.

972
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:48,480
Dude, the last thing you need
is the free dozen.

973
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:54,700
There you go.
There's your change.

974
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:58,830
Have a SweetSweet day.

975
00:57:58,870 --> 00:58:01,960
Bill, why do you want a doughnut store?
This place sucks.

976
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:04,040
Let me tell you something, kid.

977
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:05,920
Working sucks, okay?

978
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,880
Working sucks!

979
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:12,010
It doesn't matter if you're in a bank,
a department store, or a doughnut factory,

980
00:58:12,050 --> 00:58:14,180
because once you've been there long enough,
the only thing you'll care about

981
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:17,100
is when your next pay increase is,
how many vacation days you've accrued,

982
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:19,560
and if your health insurance is gonna pay
for the cholesterol medicine

983
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:22,180
that keeps your heart pumping no matter
how much shit you work through it.

984
00:58:22,270 --> 00:58:26,270
Then, after you've gained 20 or 30 pounds
because you're so fucking uptight all the time,

985
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:29,190
you wake up and discover
that you're working for your father-in-law

986
00:58:29,230 --> 00:58:32,110
in a position with a gratuitous title,
and you're totally replaceable.

987
00:58:32,190 --> 00:58:34,660
And not only is the new guy
better at your job,

988
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:37,280
but he's got a better car
and better jokes and better hair!

989
00:58:37,370 --> 00:58:38,830
So no matter what you do,

990
00:58:38,910 --> 00:58:41,410
you make sure you make
a lot of money doing it,

991
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:43,210
because it all sucks!

992
00:58:44,710 --> 00:58:48,130
And that is one lesson I,
as your mentor, can teach you.

993
00:58:48,210 --> 00:58:49,800
Whoa.

994
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:53,880
How are you?
Step right on up here.

995
00:58:53,970 --> 00:58:56,970
What would you like today, my little friend?
A glazed doughnut?

996
00:58:57,010 --> 00:58:59,220
Well, if you have any questions,
you can call us at home.

997
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:00,260
Okay.

998
00:59:00,350 --> 00:59:02,390
Otherwise, we'll send down the paperwork
on Monday. Congratulations.

999
00:59:02,430 --> 00:59:04,480
- Okay.
- Hey, Lucy has to be home by 6.

1000
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:07,060
Who's Lucy?
His imaginary friend.

1001
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:10,270
- All right, then. We'll talk Monday.
- All right.

1002
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:11,940
Take care.

1003
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:17,910
Bye.

1004
00:59:26,370 --> 00:59:28,750
So are these for, like,
baby announcements?

1005
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:37,840
Aah!

1006
00:59:37,930 --> 00:59:40,760
You think that's funny?

1007
00:59:40,850 --> 00:59:43,220
Come on. Bring them on.

1008
00:59:43,270 --> 00:59:44,810
Oh, yeah?

1009
00:59:44,890 --> 00:59:47,230
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1010
00:59:47,270 --> 00:59:48,730
Come on!

1011
00:59:50,150 --> 00:59:51,360
No guts!

1012
00:59:55,490 --> 00:59:57,860
Look at my little friend.

1013
01:00:00,570 --> 01:00:02,870
Damn, my thumb!
I lost my thumb!

1014
01:00:02,950 --> 01:00:04,950
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Where's your thumb?

1015
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,330
Where's your thumb?
Lucy, you guys, help him find his thumb!

1016
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:10,750
You guys, where is his thumb?

1017
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:14,130
It's just ketchup.

1018
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:15,590
You're dead.

1019
01:00:15,670 --> 01:00:17,930
Oh! Oh, my God! No!

Okay, so, uh,
let's take two of those boxes,

1024
01:00:33,070 --> 01:00:34,480
five of the Froggers,

1025
01:00:34,570 --> 01:00:36,070
two of the big fountains,

1026
01:00:36,150 --> 01:00:40,490
a couple dozen of those, uh,
crackers, and, uh, some rockets.

1027
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:42,870
That'll be good.
Do you have a bathroom here?

1028
01:00:42,950 --> 01:00:44,990
- Uh, yeah, it's in the back.
- Okay.

1029
01:00:45,950 --> 01:00:48,330
Uh, you know what?

1030
01:00:49,290 --> 01:00:50,500
Double that.

1031
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:54,500
Dude, you want insane?

1032
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:57,260
Try the Crack Pipe

1033
01:00:57,340 --> 01:00:59,970
and the k-k-k-k-k-k... yaah...

1034
01:01:00,050 --> 01:01:01,010
Hyper Coaster.

1035
01:01:01,090 --> 01:01:02,050
Right on.

1036
01:01:02,140 --> 01:01:03,680
You know what?

1037
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,850
Pack those together
so he won't know.

1038
01:01:07,470 --> 01:01:09,890
I'm excited.
You excited? Get excited.

1039
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:11,440
I'm excited.

1040
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:15,440
I think you have a thing
for Miss SweetSweet.

1041
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:17,030
I do?
Yeah. I don't know.

1042
01:01:17,110 --> 01:01:18,610
It seemed like...
She hates me.

1043
01:01:18,690 --> 01:01:19,950
I don't know.
She was so...

1044
01:01:20,030 --> 01:01:21,610
- Seemed like she was kind of into you.
- She's insane.

1045
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:23,490
Oh, really?
Tasting her chocolate.

1046
01:01:23,530 --> 01:01:25,080
That was hysterical.

1047
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:26,950
You know what?
Thanks for coming along.

1048
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:30,460
No problem. You know, I, uh...
I actually had a pretty good time.

1049
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:32,330
What can I say? I'm fun.

1050
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:34,040
I am.

1051
01:01:39,380 --> 01:01:40,970
Congratulations, man.

1052
01:01:41,050 --> 01:01:45,180
Yeah? Well, I still have to convince Jess
to buy into a doughnut franchise.

1053
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:49,480
You already did all the work.
Just tell her how much cash she makes.

1054
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:51,310
All she has to do
is sign a piece of paper.

1055
01:01:51,350 --> 01:01:54,440
Jess doesn't do anything
without her father's permission.

1056
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:56,190
She sounds lame, man.

1057

Please, I can take a hint.

Roser the poser

Come on.

1097
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:33,260
- I don't know why you said that.
- Can't you see that's his problem?

1098
01:04:33,350 --> 01:04:36,100
His life is falling apart.
Where's your sympathy?

You always take his side.

1100
01:04:38,190 --> 01:04:41,610
He's my brother. For obvious reasons,
he's having an identity crisis.

1101

Remember what that feels like?

1102

You know, I have to turn in a paper
on banking to get my final grade.

1108
01:05:55,050 --> 01:05:57,430
Does it cover the variables
of office basketball?

1109
01:05:57,510 --> 01:05:58,430
Very impressive.

1110
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:00,600
I'm just surprised he's not
paying someone to write it for him.

1111
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:04,100
Maybe he should stop paying people
to write papers for him.

1112
01:06:04,150 --> 01:06:06,320
Cheap shot.
Bill's right.

1113
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:08,280
You know, it's only money.

1114

l... I came to see my dad.

1117
01:06:20,540 --> 01:06:23,790
Um, then I just thought I'd stop by.

1118
01:06:23,870 --> 01:06:25,830
What's going on?

1119
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:29,880
Nothing.

1120
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:35,640
l... I was gonna see if you were doing
anything later tonight, um,

01:06:37,180 --> 01:06:40,430
You're busy, so...
Why don't you hang out?

1123
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:42,230
No, thanks. l...

1124
01:06:42,310 --> 01:06:44,190
No, I have to go.

1125
01:06:44,270 --> 01:06:46,020
I'll see you tomorrow.

1126
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:53,360
You suck.

1127
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:54,320
You suck.

1128
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:57,660
You both suck.

1129
01:07:01,830 --> 01:07:03,960
Okay.

1130
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,250
Come on.

1131
01:07:05,330 --> 01:07:06,750
Okay.

1132
01:07:08,750 --> 01:07:11,260
Can you drive around
for just a little bit longer?

1133
01:07:11,340 --> 01:07:13,720
No, I can't.
All right. Yeah.

1134
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:15,380
We'll go back to your place, then.

1135
01:07:15,430 --> 01:07:17,640
I'm dropping you off.

1136
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:19,680
What? What? Come on. Come on.

1137
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:22,060
You gotta let me sleep over.
Like, I'm not kidding.

1138
01:07:22,140 --> 01:07:24,560
Please, dude,
you gotta do this for me.

1139
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:26,770
You have to.
She'll call one of her friends.

1140
01:07:26,850 --> 01:07:29,520
She's calling one of her friends right now.
She's doing it.

1141
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:37,780
You've only had sex with one person
your entire life.

1142
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:41,290
Would you sh...
Now, you can change that.

1143
01:07:41,370 --> 01:07:43,250
Tonight, right now.
Mm-hmm.

1144
01:07:43,290 --> 01:07:45,160
You can change it.

1145
01:07:50,420 --> 01:07:53,010
Cool tent.

1146
01:07:53,090 --> 01:07:54,510
Thanks.

1147
01:07:56,220 --> 01:07:59,090
So do you live here for real?

1148
01:07:59,180 --> 01:08:02,430
Yeah. Um, temporarily.

1149
01:08:02,470 --> 01:08:06,810
Hey, do you get any, like,
wild animals out here?

1150
01:08:08,690 --> 01:08:10,810
We're in a backyard.

1151
01:08:10,860 --> 01:08:12,730
All right. Hey, take this.

1152
01:08:12,820 --> 01:08:16,070
Now be careful.
That's White Widow.

1153
01:08:16,150 --> 01:08:18,360
It's really strong.

1154
01:08:18,410 --> 01:08:20,320
It's good. Trust me.

1155
01:08:20,410 --> 01:08:22,490
Put on some music.

1156
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:26,790
Come on, we're dancing.

1157
01:08:26,870 --> 01:08:30,170
Get up. Come on.
Get up. Give me your hand.

1158
01:08:30,210 --> 01:08:33,550
Lucy? Lucy, my hand.
Take my hand, Lucy.

1159
01:08:33,590 --> 01:08:35,300
Get up.

1160
01:08:35,340 --> 01:08:36,260
Bill, dance. Come on.

1161
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:38,220
Hold on.

1162
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:40,300
Come on, Bill. Get up.

1163
01:08:40,390 --> 01:08:43,560
Come on, Bill. Come on.

1164
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:44,890
Come on, Billy.

1165
01:08:44,930 --> 01:08:46,390
Come on.

1166
01:08:48,270 --> 01:08:51,150
Bill, dance with us.

1167
01:08:51,190 --> 01:08:53,570
He'll be sorry.

1168
01:09:00,450 --> 01:09:03,160
Whoo-hoo!

1169
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:05,370
<i># I am the storm #</i>

1170
01:09:05,410 --> 01:09:08,040
<i># I am the wonder #</i>

1171
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:09,580
<i># I am the flashlight #</i>

1172
01:09:09,670 --> 01:09:12,840
<i># I twist, sudden explosion #</i>

1173
01:09:18,550 --> 01:09:19,720
Whoo!

1174
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:21,760
Whoo-hoo!

1175
01:09:25,970 --> 01:09:28,230
What's going on out there?

1176
01:09:28,270 --> 01:09:30,940
Let him have some fun.

1177
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:36,360
It's 10:30.

1178
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:39,400
Go do some sit-ups.

1179
01:09:39,450 --> 01:09:41,070
No.

1180
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:42,660
Do not tell him. It's a secret.

1181
01:09:42,740 --> 01:09:45,700
Wait. Wait.

1182
01:09:45,740 --> 01:09:48,580
I have a really good secret.

1183
01:09:50,370 --> 01:09:52,000
I got fake boobs.

1184
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:53,880
No way. You slut.

1185
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:55,460
I know!

1186
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:56,670
I love that bra.

1187
01:09:56,750 --> 01:10:01,260
And then the matching panties
with the little bows at the sides.

1188
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:03,640
Oh, my God.

1189
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:04,890
Fucking sweet.

1190
01:10:04,970 --> 01:10:07,140
Can I touch 'em?
Of course.

1191
01:10:07,180 --> 01:10:08,270
Oh, my God.

1192
01:10:08,350 --> 01:10:09,350
Me, too.
Mm-mm.

1193
01:10:09,390 --> 01:10:10,350
What?

1194
01:10:10,390 --> 01:10:14,610
Oh, my God.
Bill, don't you wanna touch these?

1195
01:10:14,690 --> 01:10:17,070
Don't you wanna feel them?

1196
01:10:17,110 --> 01:10:18,730
They look nice.

1197
01:10:18,780 --> 01:10:21,320
Come on.

1198
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:31,370
Come on. Just once.

1199
01:10:45,550 --> 01:10:47,180
What are you doing?

1200
01:10:47,260 --> 01:10:49,930
Making coffee.

1201
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:54,730
Put some pants on.
You look like a Froot Loop.

1202
01:10:54,810 --> 01:10:57,110
It's actually pretty comfortable.

1203
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:00,480
Don't you have school?

1204
01:11:00,570 --> 01:11:01,650
It's Saturday.

1205
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:04,700
The picnic.

1206
01:11:04,740 --> 01:11:06,450
Don't worry, I'm making the coffee.

1207
01:11:08,830 --> 01:11:11,160
Jesus.

1208
01:11:48,990 --> 01:11:50,410
Ugh!

1209
01:11:52,410 --> 01:11:53,370
Again.

1210
01:11:58,170 --> 01:11:59,670
Always stick close to me.

1211
01:11:59,710 --> 01:12:02,090
When I'm walking, you always
have to be close to me.

1212
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:23,860
You guys, we gotta
get Jess out of here.

1213
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:25,820
Sarah brought Jim and Jane.

1214
01:12:28,030 --> 01:12:29,450
Come on.

1215
01:12:31,330 --> 01:12:32,490
Jess?

1216
01:12:32,580 --> 01:12:34,450
I said 50 yards.

1217
01:12:34,540 --> 01:12:36,160
This doesn't concern you.

1218
01:12:36,250 --> 01:12:37,920
I can't believe you have
the nerve to bring her here.

1219
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:41,210
- Sir, you're gonna have to step back.
- It's not what it looks like, Jessica.

1220
01:12:41,250 --> 01:12:44,130
Let go of me.
Meet me at the back entrance.

1221
01:12:44,170 --> 01:12:47,720
Back... Okay. Come on,
Lucy, let's go. Come on.

1222
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:54,560
Hi. I'll be right back.
I'm just gonna check on security.

1223
01:12:58,020 --> 01:12:59,850
Get in.

1224
01:12:59,940 --> 01:13:02,400
Your order said 50 yards.

1225
01:13:26,630 --> 01:13:30,220
Um, could I have everyone's attention,
please, ladies and gentlemen?

1226
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:32,470
Ladies and gentlemen. Ahem.

1227
01:13:32,550 --> 01:13:36,970
It's almost time for me to introduce
my father, Mr. John Jacobi.

1228
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:42,520
Right. But first I'd like to,
uh, take a quick look back

1229
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:45,770
to the year 1902.

1230
01:14:06,630 --> 01:14:10,970
As legend has it, there wasn't even
a road that, uh, would get you here,

1231
01:14:11,050 --> 01:14:13,760
and once you did get here, well,
there wasn't that much to see.

1232
01:14:25,940 --> 01:14:30,990
It was only through our family's
perseverance and foresight that we were...

1233
01:14:54,090 --> 01:14:56,100
What's going on?

1234
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:45,020
Bill!

1235
01:15:46,270 --> 01:15:47,810
Bill!

1236
01:15:52,570 --> 01:15:54,820
That was fucking awesome.

1237
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:56,030
Did you see the crack pipe?

1238
01:15:56,110 --> 01:15:59,160
Yes, I saw the crack pipe.

1239
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:01,950
What I want to know
is how it got in my car.

1240
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:03,700
You gotta admit it was
the highlight of the show.

1241
01:16:03,790 --> 01:16:05,500
If I could stand up straight, I'd kill you.

1242
01:16:05,580 --> 01:16:08,080
I gotta get some of those
crack pipes for homecoming.

1243
01:16:08,130 --> 01:16:10,500
Why don't you focus
on something productive?

1244
01:16:10,590 --> 01:16:12,500
Having fun is productive.

1245
01:16:22,140 --> 01:16:23,270
Let's get out of here.

1246
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:28,020
You look like shit.

1247
01:16:33,610 --> 01:16:35,570
Wanna stop at Big Bun?
I'm kind of hungry.

1248
01:16:35,650 --> 01:16:36,900
Yeah, let's do that.

1249
01:16:36,990 --> 01:16:39,620
I'll take a double supreme,
large fries, and a soda.

1250
01:16:39,660 --> 01:16:41,030
No, I don't want
to stop at the Big Bun.

1251
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:42,700
I'm just kidding.

1252
01:16:42,790 --> 01:16:45,790
You're not still mad about
the crack pipe, are you?

1253
01:16:45,830 --> 01:16:47,750
Shut up and drive.

1254
01:16:47,790 --> 01:16:50,380
Asshole!

1255
01:16:50,460 --> 01:16:54,710
<i>#... never wanna say good night #</i>

1256
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:57,220
<i># There's nothing left to say #</i>

1257
01:16:57,300 --> 01:17:01,470

1258
01:17:01,510 --> 01:17:03,140

<i># That we're all in love with you #</i>

1260
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:10,270
I'm gonna go check in.
You wait in the lobby.

1261
01:17:10,310 --> 01:17:12,060
Okay.

1262
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:15,320
You haven't
figured one thing out.

1263
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:16,780
I've got one or two in there.

1264
01:17:16,820 --> 01:17:20,740
No, you don't.

1265
01:17:20,780 --> 01:17:22,240
Thanks for coming.

1266
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:23,530
I don't mind.

1267
01:17:23,620 --> 01:17:25,490
See? You like hanging out with me.

1268
01:17:25,580 --> 01:17:27,580
Of course
I like hanging out with you.

1269
01:17:27,620 --> 01:17:28,960
Really?

1270
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:30,620
Yeah.

1271
01:17:30,670 --> 01:17:36,130
I mean, your obsession with women's
underwear is kind of creepy.

1272
01:17:36,170 --> 01:17:37,760
There's nothing creepy about that.

1273
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:40,340
You're kind of a stalker.

1274
01:17:40,430 --> 01:17:43,600
Here, I've been meaning
to give that to you.

1275
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:46,100
Whoa. What's this for?

1276
01:17:46,180 --> 01:17:49,390
You don't have to pay me
to be your friend.

1277
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:50,940
I want to be.

1278
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:54,610
Thanks.

1279
01:17:54,690 --> 01:17:57,780
I'd like to be your friend, too.

1280
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:01,610
I gotta go check up on Bill.

1281
01:18:01,660 --> 01:18:03,030
All right.

1282
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:06,490
Whoa. Whoa.

1283
01:18:06,580 --> 01:18:07,870
Just friends.

1284
01:18:07,950 --> 01:18:08,870
I get it.

1285
01:18:08,910 --> 01:18:09,910
Okay.

1286
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,460
- I get it.
- Okay.

1287
01:18:11,540 --> 01:18:13,210
Hey.

1288
01:18:13,290 --> 01:18:14,380
Sneaky little shit.

1289
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:23,260
Oh, my God.
Will you put that thing away?

1290
01:18:23,340 --> 01:18:25,800
You're gonna break it. Oh.

1291
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:29,520
Hey. Thank God you called.

1292
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:31,520
The entire club
is out looking for you.

1293
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,100
The fourth hole is totally on fire.

1294
01:18:33,190 --> 01:18:34,150
I heard.

1295
01:18:34,230 --> 01:18:36,110
My father had to
cancel his announcement.

1296
01:18:36,190 --> 01:18:38,480
He's furious. I don't know
what I'm gonna tell him this time.

1297
01:18:38,530 --> 01:18:40,820
You know what?

1298
01:18:40,860 --> 01:18:44,620
We've spent enough time
worrying about your father.

1299
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:47,580
The truth is I don't care
what he thinks about me.

1300
01:18:47,660 --> 01:18:48,950
Bill...
No.

1301
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:53,210
Did you know that every
single day all I can think about

1302
01:18:53,250 --> 01:18:56,670
is how much I hate working for him?

1303
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:00,340
I should've said something
a long time ago.

1304
01:19:00,420 --> 01:19:02,050
Before this whole Chip Johnson thing.

1305
01:19:02,130 --> 01:19:05,590
He's a total action news idiot.

1306
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:07,930
What? The guy's an idiot.

1307
01:19:07,970 --> 01:19:09,930
He's right. He is an idiot.

1308
01:19:09,970 --> 01:19:12,020
Fine, he's an idiot.

1309
01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:14,190
But then, so what?

1310
01:19:14,270 --> 01:19:17,270
This whole doughnut thing
is a new career?

1311
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:18,650
Oh, God, Jim and Jane.

1312
01:19:18,690 --> 01:19:20,570
They're going to think I'm insane.

1313
01:19:20,610 --> 01:19:23,240
Yeah, they were a little confused
when I told them I was your wife.

1314
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:25,530
Well, that's because I had
to tell them that you're Lucy,

1315
01:19:25,610 --> 01:19:28,120
or Lucy was you, so that they
would get the deal done,

1316
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:31,410
but I don't think I have
a doughnut franchise in my future.

1317
01:19:33,870 --> 01:19:35,210
Jess...

1318
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:38,500
I love you.

1319
01:19:39,590 --> 01:19:41,510
But our lives suck.

1320
01:19:49,470 --> 01:19:50,760
Can I give you a ride?

1321
01:19:50,850 --> 01:19:54,180
No. I have one.

1322
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:06,780
Ohh...

1323
01:21:09,130 --> 01:21:11,760
I'd like to tender my resignation,

1324
01:21:11,850 --> 01:21:14,060
effective immediately.

1325
01:21:14,140 --> 01:21:17,350
And I know my opinion
is of little consequence to you,

1326
01:21:17,430 --> 01:21:18,940
but, uh...

1327
01:21:19,020 --> 01:21:21,860
I think hunting defenseless
animals for sport is...

1328
01:21:23,270 --> 01:21:24,780
it's wrong.

1329
01:21:25,900 --> 01:21:26,900
Oh.

1330
01:21:26,990 --> 01:21:29,610
And, uh, John Jr. was right.

1331
01:21:30,700 --> 01:21:31,820
I don't belong here.

1332
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:35,370
You know what? I would have
done exactly the same thing

1333
01:21:35,410 --> 01:21:36,830
to that Chip Johnson fellow.

1334
01:21:40,460 --> 01:21:41,830
Good luck to you, Bill.

1335
01:21:43,590 --> 01:21:44,630
Thank you, sir.

1336
01:21:48,550 --> 01:21:50,180
Hi. They're waiting for you.

1337
01:21:53,850 --> 01:21:56,140
...there is, we're on the corner...

1338
01:21:57,470 --> 01:21:59,020
Hi.

1339
01:21:59,060 --> 01:22:03,730
Your wife was just sharing
some of her ideas with us.

1340
01:22:03,810 --> 01:22:05,940
Well, every partnership
has its up and downs.

1341
01:22:06,030 --> 01:22:07,940
The important thing
is that you're able to stick it out.

1342
01:22:07,990 --> 01:22:09,700
I don't think we've ever seen anyone

1343
01:22:09,780 --> 01:22:12,070
so committed to getting
one of our franchises.

1344
01:22:14,410 --> 01:22:15,700
We did it.

1345
01:22:15,780 --> 01:22:17,240
You did it.

1346
01:22:20,210 --> 01:22:21,500
You look great.

1347
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:25,960
Are you happy?

1348
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,130
I am happy.

1349
01:22:28,210 --> 01:22:29,760
I am happy.

1350
01:22:31,340 --> 01:22:33,340
But not because of the doughnuts.

1351
01:22:33,430 --> 01:22:34,890
You know, before you got here,

1352
01:22:34,930 --> 01:22:37,390
I was going to tell them
I didn't want the franchise anymore.

1353
01:22:40,020 --> 01:22:41,270
I think you should keep it.

1354
01:22:41,350 --> 01:22:43,440
Why?

1355
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:47,110
Because I don't think
this is the life that I want.

1356
01:22:47,190 --> 01:22:49,650
I don't want
to be the doughnut guy.

1357
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:53,410
I don't want to be the bank guy.

1358
01:22:54,370 --> 01:22:58,370
Quite frankly, I'm kind of...

1359
01:22:58,450 --> 01:23:00,500
sick of being the deranged fan guy.

1360
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:03,620
Okay.

1361
01:23:06,210 --> 01:23:08,340
You can be whoever you want.

1362
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:04,640
Hey.

1363
01:24:07,230 --> 01:24:08,480
It's your grade.

1364
01:24:09,610 --> 01:24:11,570
I can't believe you're not
going to mentor me anymore.

1365
01:24:11,650 --> 01:24:14,740
Kid, you don't need a mentor.
You got it all figured out.

1366
01:24:14,780 --> 01:24:18,200
Sometimes. But hey, I'm still
going to miss hanging out with you.

1367
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:20,080
I'll miss you, too, kid.

1368
01:24:20,160 --> 01:24:22,040
But listen to me,
and this is important.

1369
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:25,410
I don't want you to float through life
pretending nothing matters

1370
01:24:25,460 --> 01:24:27,460
because trust me, one day
you're going to wake up,

1371
01:24:27,540 --> 01:24:30,290
and you're going to realize
you don't have the life you wanted.

1372
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:33,210
You understand?

1373
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:34,720
I understand, Bill.

1374
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:37,220
Good. All right, I have to go.

1375
01:24:37,300 --> 01:24:39,090
Where are you going?

1376
01:24:39,180 --> 01:24:41,850
I don't know,
but I'm excited to find out.

1377
01:24:46,730 --> 01:24:47,690
Thanks, kid.

1378
01:24:55,820 --> 01:24:57,570
Can I come visit?

1379
01:24:57,660 --> 01:24:59,490
Check your locker.

1380
01:25:06,910 --> 01:25:08,080
Are you excited?

1381
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:20,970
Holy shit.

1382
01:25:40,610 --> 01:25:46,750
