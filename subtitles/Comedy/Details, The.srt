00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:34,267
...I should probably
skedaddle.

162
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:36,274
Bye.

163
00:10:43,274 --> 00:10:45,412
[laughing]

164
00:10:47,412 --> 00:10:48,845
[grunts]

165
00:10:48,846 --> 00:10:52,082
[Nealy] Look!
There's Daddy! [Laughs]

166
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:53,796
Watch your step.

167
00:11:04,796 --> 00:11:09,332
Now when these little suckers
run down this tree...

168
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:10,935
[wind chimes chiming]

169
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:12,837
...I can hear them coming
and I can run outside

170
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,872
and scare the living
S-H-I-T out of them.

171
00:11:14,873 --> 00:11:16,509
Great.

172
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:19,243
[boy] Are the raccoons up there?

173
00:11:19,244 --> 00:11:20,879
[Nealy] Daddy thinks
they're up there.

174
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,480
That's why Daddy is spreading
stinky coyote urine

175
00:11:23,481 --> 00:11:26,216
all over to scare them off,

176
00:11:26,217 --> 00:11:30,454
even though we've got tons of
real coyotes all over the place.

177
00:11:30,455 --> 00:11:32,956
Actually, it's
mountain lion urine.

178
00:11:32,957 --> 00:11:34,925
Higher up on the food chain,

179
00:11:34,926 --> 00:11:36,826
and I think it smells delicious.

180
00:11:36,827 --> 00:11:39,363
Hey, you know, maybe we should
think about putting in

181
00:11:39,364 --> 00:11:42,032
a series of pathways
and pocket gardens,

182
00:11:42,033 --> 00:11:45,312
like out front, and not give the
raccoons anything to turn over.

183
00:11:54,312 --> 00:11:55,450
[footsteps running]

184
00:11:58,450 --> 00:11:59,550
[grunts]

185
00:11:59,551 --> 00:12:01,135
[wind chimes chiming]

186
00:12:18,135 --> 00:12:20,176
[rustling]

187
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:26,481
[raccoon chittering]

188
00:12:30,481 --> 00:12:32,023
[whispering] Go.

189
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:39,168
[hisses]

190
00:12:50,168 --> 00:12:53,173
[whispering] Hey! Drop that!

191
00:12:55,173 --> 00:12:56,076
[whispering] Stop!

192
00:12:58,076 --> 00:13:00,311
[whispering] Come on!

193
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:03,230
[whispering] Fucker!

194
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,464
Hey, Doc.

195
00:13:20,465 --> 00:13:23,334
Hey, Lincoln, what's up?
Where is everybody?

196
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:25,004
Don't know, Doc.
No one showed up yet.

197
00:13:26,004 --> 00:13:27,303
How's the baby business?

198
00:13:27,304 --> 00:13:28,505
- It's good.
- Yeah?

199
00:13:28,506 --> 00:13:30,641
- Yeah.
- Gotta warm up.

200
00:13:30,642 --> 00:13:32,209
How's everything for you?

201
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:33,544
You, uh, you still workin'
at that nightclub?

202
00:13:33,545 --> 00:13:35,245
Oh, no.

203
00:13:35,246 --> 00:13:38,181
Quit that a while back,
too much strife.

204
00:13:38,182 --> 00:13:40,085
Working for the, uh,
Manufacturers Mineral Company...

205
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:42,952
hauling, uh, rocks and gravel.

206
00:13:42,953 --> 00:13:44,087
It's been cool.

207
00:13:44,088 --> 00:13:45,521
I was gonna ask you
about that shirt,

208
00:13:45,522 --> 00:13:47,458
- but it says "Leonard" on it.
- That's my name, Doc.

209
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:50,927
Lincoln's just a nickname my
teammates gave me in college.

210
00:13:50,928 --> 00:13:52,528
- Basketball teammates?
- Yep.

211
00:13:52,529 --> 00:13:54,565
They used to call me "Link"

212
00:13:54,566 --> 00:13:57,100
because, uh,
when I joined the squad,

213
00:13:57,101 --> 00:14:00,571
fellas said they no longer had
a weak link in the lineup.

214
00:14:00,572 --> 00:14:03,374
Then that became "Lincoln,"

215
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:06,442
because I led 'em out of the
slavery of a third place team.

216
00:14:06,443 --> 00:14:10,080
I guess it doesn't surprise me
you were such a stud in college.

217
00:14:10,081 --> 00:14:12,049
- Yeah?
- When we first started playing together,

218
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:15,152
- before you got old and slow.
- Oh, damn, man. [Laughs]

219
00:14:15,153 --> 00:14:18,989
I, uh, I thought you played well
enough to have been pro.

220
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:21,524
I almost did, Doc,
but it wasn't in the cards.

221
00:14:21,525 --> 00:14:23,127
Huh. Why not?

222
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:24,029
Well, I'll tell you the story
if you want to hear it.

223
00:14:25,029 --> 00:14:27,364
- Yeah, sure.
- All right.

224
00:14:27,365 --> 00:14:29,532
Whoo. Good shot.

225
00:14:29,533 --> 00:14:31,303
It was my sophomore year...

226
00:14:32,303 --> 00:14:34,071
...and we had a real good team.

227
00:14:34,072 --> 00:14:36,008
I mean, real good.

228
00:14:37,008 --> 00:14:39,143
We had, uh,
just won the big game.

229
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:41,378
- Clinched our conference.
- Wow.

230
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:44,514
And, uh... damn.

231
00:14:44,515 --> 00:14:47,216
It was like a dream, Doc.

232
00:14:47,217 --> 00:14:50,487
Like a real dream.

233
00:14:50,488 --> 00:14:54,224
[muffled] They get in this huge
car accident and that's it.

234
00:14:54,225 --> 00:14:55,592
That's it.
His career's over.

235
00:14:55,593 --> 00:14:57,127
It's like over

236
00:14:57,128 --> 00:15:00,397
and like right, right
when he would turn pro, too.

237
00:15:00,398 --> 00:15:03,334
It's, it's,
it's like a crusher.

238
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:06,470
He's always got these pieces
of gauze taped to his arm.

239
00:15:06,471 --> 00:15:09,540
Turns out the poor guy's
got kidney failure.

240
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,008
[toilet flushes]

241
00:15:11,009 --> 00:15:13,243
Jesus.

242
00:15:13,244 --> 00:15:16,446
It's amazing how you can know
someone for so long,

243
00:15:16,447 --> 00:15:19,582
but you never really know 'em.

244
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:21,017
Wow.

245
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:22,252
[spits]

246
00:15:22,253 --> 00:15:26,123
He's got these terrible,
cracked teeth.

247
00:15:26,124 --> 00:15:29,125
I was thinking about paying
for him to go to the dentist,

248
00:15:29,126 --> 00:15:32,463
but I don't know.

249
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:36,100
Well, you know, if his passion's
really basketball...

250
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,534
- Mmm. [Spits]
- ...you should talk to Ron's sister

251
00:15:37,535 --> 00:15:39,069
about that school she runs.

252
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:41,075
Maybe they have
a coaching job open.

253
00:15:44,075 --> 00:15:46,645
That's not a bad idea.

254
00:15:48,645 --> 00:15:50,017
[knocking]

255
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:53,082
Hi.

256
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,685
Sorry to bother you,
Dr. Lang,

257
00:15:54,686 --> 00:15:58,589
but when your guys broke
through your wall the other day

258
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,524
a bunch of dust
got into my house.

259
00:16:00,525 --> 00:16:02,028
Oh. I'm really sorry
about that.

260
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:04,460
[dog whines]

261
00:16:04,461 --> 00:16:06,129
I also, I, I noticed that you're

262
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:07,765
expanding your front
room towards our house.

263
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:10,401
- Right.
- I looked it up for me on the internet.

264
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:13,440
The code is to leave
a five foot passage.

265
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,374
[dog growls]

266
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:18,776
What can I do?

267
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:20,811
You can't see it anymore
because I spent hours

268
00:16:20,812 --> 00:16:23,680
cleaning everything with
white vinegar and a toothbrush.

269
00:16:23,681 --> 00:16:28,152
[chuckles] But you can
see it on the TV here.

270
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,254
Oh.

271
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:32,822
Wow, well, I can have the guys
working on my project

272
00:16:32,823 --> 00:16:34,391
come by and clean up for you.

273
00:16:34,392 --> 00:16:38,461
I hardly think that a,
a laborer

274
00:16:38,462 --> 00:16:40,230
who hammers and saws
all day would know

275
00:16:40,231 --> 00:16:41,697
how to clean my house.

276
00:16:41,698 --> 00:16:43,668
Yeah, you might be right
about that.

277
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,701
And this has been very,
very hard on me.

278
00:16:45,702 --> 00:16:48,839
I mean, with all this dust just,
it's just floating around.

279
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,075
Just look!
It's everywhere! See?

280
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:54,380
It's everywhere!
Here, you see it?

281
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,546
I mean, you're a doctor.

282
00:16:56,547 --> 00:16:58,247
You've heard of
environmental illnesses.

283
00:16:58,248 --> 00:17:00,652
- Sure, I've heard of 'em.
- That's, that's why I keep this

284
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:03,454
basil leaf pinned to my lapel.
It purifies the air.

285
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:06,757
[inhales deeply]
My naprapath suggested it.

286
00:17:06,758 --> 00:17:08,558
It's been a lifesaver.

287
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,461
Well, I'm very happy to pay for
a professional cleaning service

288
00:17:11,462 --> 00:17:13,131
if you need it.
Whatever the cost.

289
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:15,231
You give me the bill,
I'll write the check.

290
00:17:15,232 --> 00:17:17,202
I just want you to be happy.

291
00:17:18,202 --> 00:17:19,803
That's very nice of you.

292
00:17:19,804 --> 00:17:22,306
Not at all.

293
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:24,241
All right,
I should get goin', so...

294
00:17:24,242 --> 00:17:25,741
- Dr. Lang?
- Yeah?

295
00:17:25,742 --> 00:17:27,642
I heard you last night...
[chuckles]

296
00:17:27,643 --> 00:17:29,614
...try to scare away
your raccoons.

297
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:31,848
Oh, I'm sorry about that.

298
00:17:31,849 --> 00:17:33,483
[chuckling] That's OK.

299
00:17:33,484 --> 00:17:34,786
I don't sleep much anyway.

300
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:37,320
- You don't sleep?
- No.

301
00:17:37,321 --> 00:17:40,259
I get a little
every few weeks, but...

302
00:17:41,259 --> 00:17:43,127
...basically
I'm a night creature.

303
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:44,460
Huh.

304
00:17:44,461 --> 00:17:47,230
Well, I could get you some
samples of Ambien

305
00:17:47,231 --> 00:17:48,732
from the office.
It might help with that.

306
00:17:48,733 --> 00:17:50,233
- Really?
- Yeah.

307
00:17:50,234 --> 00:17:51,434
You know what?

308
00:17:51,435 --> 00:17:52,904
I'll drop 'em in your mailbox

309
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,479
when I get home from work.

310
00:18:01,479 --> 00:18:04,326
[whistling]

311
00:18:15,326 --> 00:18:18,662
[grunts and groans] Nealy!

312
00:18:18,663 --> 00:18:20,663
Wow, this stuff is burning
the skin of my hand

313
00:18:20,664 --> 00:18:22,469
just touching it!

314
00:18:24,469 --> 00:18:26,269
[groans]

315
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,904
- [sighs]
- I doubt a raccoon

316
00:18:27,905 --> 00:18:29,472
is gonna come back here

317
00:18:29,473 --> 00:18:32,608
after he snorts up
a nose full of this.

318
00:18:32,609 --> 00:18:34,912
[exhales]

319
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:40,753
So... I read online today
about this guy...

320
00:18:42,753 --> 00:18:45,956
...he sticks a barrel
into his grass

321
00:18:45,957 --> 00:18:48,758
and he throws steaks in,
and during the night,

322
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:50,661
the raccoons, they jump in,

323
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:52,595
but they can't climb out.

324
00:18:52,596 --> 00:18:56,365
He runs a hose from his garage out
of the tailpipe from his car,

325
00:18:56,366 --> 00:19:01,371
he sticks a lid on
and asphyxiates them.

326
00:19:01,372 --> 00:19:03,775
You know, I really don't feel
like talking about this

327
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:05,778
five nights a week.

328
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:08,778
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to bore you.

329
00:19:08,779 --> 00:19:11,748
We should re-landscape
without sod,

330
00:19:11,749 --> 00:19:13,283
like I keep telling you.

331
00:19:13,284 --> 00:19:16,252
You know, fifteen hundred
square feet of grass

332
00:19:16,253 --> 00:19:19,256
and a new irrigation system
was expensive.

333
00:19:19,257 --> 00:19:20,824
You just don't throw it away.

334
00:19:20,825 --> 00:19:22,327
Please don't use
that tone with me.

335
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:24,327
I didn't use any tone with you.

336
00:19:24,328 --> 00:19:26,963
OK, don't deny using a tone
when you use a tone.

337
00:19:26,964 --> 00:19:29,266
I'm not crazy, I know
what I just heard.

338
00:19:29,267 --> 00:19:30,968
I didn't call you crazy.

339
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:33,403
But you implied it,
though, didn't you?

340
00:19:33,404 --> 00:19:35,871
As if I'm not sane enough
to judge your tone of voice.

341
00:19:35,872 --> 00:19:37,741
- Maybe you are crazy.
- Oh, oh, right.

342
00:19:37,742 --> 00:19:40,477
Oh, oh, now the truth
comes out.

343
00:19:40,478 --> 00:19:43,412
- Well, you want to know the truth?
- Yeah, sure, I love the truth.

344
00:19:43,413 --> 00:19:45,315
OK. The truth is,
you are the crazy one, OK?

345
00:19:45,316 --> 00:19:46,984
- Right, yes, of course I am. Yeah.
- With these goddamn raccoons,

346
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:50,254
you are acting like a complete
fucking deranged moron.

347
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:52,756
Now I'm acting like
a fucking deranged moron?

348
00:19:52,757 --> 00:19:54,892
- Keep your fucking voice down.
- You keep your fuckin' voice down.

349
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:56,927
Don't you dare wake up Miles.

350
00:19:56,928 --> 00:19:58,961
This is it! This is perfect!

351
00:19:58,962 --> 00:20:00,796
This is just what you want,
isn't it?

352
00:20:00,797 --> 00:20:03,032
- What is what I want?
- You want me to get crazy

353
00:20:03,033 --> 00:20:05,433
- so you can remind me of how crazy I get...
- Oh, mission accomplished!

354
00:20:05,434 --> 00:20:07,303
...when you make me
apologize to you!

355
00:20:07,304 --> 00:20:08,972
You're crazy with your
fucking Indian pepper bullshit!

356
00:20:08,973 --> 00:20:11,475
Hey! I'm working on our
fucking lawn for our son!

357
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:14,344
- What?
- But of course I'm the crazy one!

358
00:20:14,345 --> 00:20:16,312
And of course you have no
fucking responsibility

359
00:20:16,313 --> 00:20:17,414
- at all in this fight!
- You know what,

360
00:20:17,415 --> 00:20:19,449
just go fuck one
of your raccoons!

361
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:22,055
More likely than fucking you!

362

[rooster crows]

365
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:19,343
Hi, Jeffrey.
Fancy meeting you here.

366
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:21,510
Uh, here's for
your cleaning service.

367
00:21:21,511 --> 00:21:23,346
- [timer ringing]
- Thank you.

368
00:21:23,347 --> 00:21:25,015
Oh, your timing's impeccable.

369
00:21:25,016 --> 00:21:26,649
I have a surprise for you,
come on in.

370
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,018
I'd love to come in,
but I've gotta get to work.

371
00:21:28,019 --> 00:21:30,886
Come on in.

372
00:21:30,887 --> 00:21:32,127
I won't bite.

373
00:21:37,127 --> 00:21:39,528
Now just wait here, just a sec.

374
00:21:39,529 --> 00:21:40,663
OK.

375
00:21:40,664 --> 00:21:43,799
I found these really
great blueberries

376
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,603
at the farmer's
market the other day

377
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:49,506
and it inspired
me to do some baking.

378
00:21:49,507 --> 00:21:51,775
So...

379
00:21:51,776 --> 00:21:53,376
I hope you like pies.

380
00:21:53,377 --> 00:21:54,610
Oh, you didn't have to do that.

381
00:21:54,611 --> 00:21:56,146
Well, the blueberries
were so beautiful,

382
00:21:56,147 --> 00:21:57,713
I had to do something
with them.

383
00:21:57,714 --> 00:21:59,449
Did you know they're
a superfood?

384
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:00,617
And, and the crust
is gluten-free

385
00:22:00,618 --> 00:22:02,719
which means I didn't use flour.

386
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,122
I used spelt.

387
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:06,890
By the way...

388
00:22:06,891 --> 00:22:09,625
[sighs] ...I'm sleeping
so much better,

389
00:22:09,626 --> 00:22:11,827
thanks to your
magic little pills.

390
00:22:11,828 --> 00:22:13,430
Oh, that's good to hear.

391
00:22:13,431 --> 00:22:14,997
- [chuckles]
- [cell phone ringing]

392
00:22:14,998 --> 00:22:16,798
And Jeff, you haven't
seen my Matthew

393
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,502
wandering around the
neighborhood, have you?

394
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:19,903
- Uh...
- My cat.

395
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:22,672
- Your cat?
- He didn't come home last night,

396
00:22:22,673 --> 00:22:25,107
but you know how cats are,
nine lives and all.

397
00:22:25,108 --> 00:22:28,644
Actually, I was thinking about
buying a miniature camera

398
00:22:28,645 --> 00:22:29,814
and attaching it to his collar

399
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:31,847
to see where
he skulks around to.

400
00:22:31,848 --> 00:22:36,585
- Oh, that's, uh, an idea.
- [chuckles] Yeah.

401
00:22:36,586 --> 00:22:38,500
Thank you.

402
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,068
<i>[woman] Hey, babe.
Thanks for writing.</i>

403
00:22:53,069 --> 00:22:54,704
<i>I really would love to get
together with you</i>

404
00:22:54,705 --> 00:22:58,040
<i>one of these days
for a, uh, a rubdown.</i>

405
00:22:58,041 --> 00:23:00,810
<i>[chuckles]
Hope to see you soon.</i>

406
00:23:00,811 --> 00:23:03,113
<i>And if we do get together,</i>

407
00:23:03,114 --> 00:23:05,617
<i>don't forget
to bring your friend...</i>

408
00:23:07,617 --> 00:23:08,673
<i>...Mary Jane.</i>

409
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:30,574
[chuckles]

410
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:31,843
You're sweating.

411
00:23:31,844 --> 00:23:33,210
Well, I walked here.

412
00:23:33,211 --> 00:23:35,745
I tried to get
here as fast as I could.

413
00:23:35,746 --> 00:23:38,181
Is everything all right?
What's goin' on?

414
00:23:38,182 --> 00:23:42,184
Yeah, just needed to talk
to a friend and have a drink.

415
00:23:42,185 --> 00:23:44,587
- You want one?
- Of course.

416
00:23:44,588 --> 00:23:47,857
Have I ever said no to that
question after twelve?

417
00:23:47,858 --> 00:23:50,163
So what are we
talkin' about here?

418
00:23:52,163 --> 00:23:54,034
We are talking about...

419
00:23:57,034 --> 00:23:58,768
...infidelity.

420
00:23:58,769 --> 00:24:02,137
- [chuckles]
- I believe you have some experience with that.

421
00:24:02,138 --> 00:24:04,508
Uh, yes, I do.

422
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:09,211
Uh, is Mister Virgin Mary
being unfaithful?

423
00:24:09,212 --> 00:24:10,947
[chuckles] No.

424
00:24:10,948 --> 00:24:14,550
Not unfaithful. [Lnhales]

425
00:24:14,551 --> 00:24:16,786
- Not technically.
- Oh. [Chuckles]

426
00:24:16,787 --> 00:24:20,891
But I have been emailing with
girls on the internet.

427
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:22,659
Girls on the internet.

428
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:26,896
OK, what, what kind of girls
on the internet?

429
00:24:26,897 --> 00:24:30,232
Sensual massage therapists.

430
00:24:30,233 --> 00:24:31,970
Oh, you mean whores?

431
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:34,000
I guess.

432
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:36,672
OK, well, I think

433
00:24:36,673 --> 00:24:39,174
that sleeping with a prostitute

434
00:24:39,175 --> 00:24:41,745
"technically" counts
as being unfaithful.

435
00:24:41,746 --> 00:24:44,247
No, no, I am not sleeping
with them, that's the point.

436
00:24:44,248 --> 00:24:46,916
I just get off on flirting
with them online.

437
00:24:46,917 --> 00:24:48,985
I don't go through with it.

438
00:24:48,986 --> 00:24:51,254
Though truthfully,

439
00:24:51,255 --> 00:24:53,827
I do think about it.

440
00:24:57,827 --> 00:25:00,031
When was the last time
you and Nealy had sex?

441
00:25:01,031 --> 00:25:03,199
[chuckles]

442
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,400
Oh, uh...

443
00:25:04,401 --> 00:25:06,669
<i>- ...it was make-up sex.
- [Rebecca] Really?</i>

444
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:07,969
<i>- [Jeff] Yeah.
- [Rebecca laughs]</i>

445
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:09,574
<i>[Jeff] Do you wanna hear about
it?</i>

446
00:25:09,575 --> 00:25:11,807
<i>- [Rebecca] Yes, of course.
- [Jeff] OK.</i>

447
00:25:11,808 --> 00:25:14,344
<i>Uh, well,
I was fuckin' around online,</i>

448
00:25:14,345 --> 00:25:17,047
you know, looking up porn,
checking out my internet chicks,

449
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:19,348
<i>- my net whores. [Laughs]
- [laughs]</i>

450
00:25:19,349 --> 00:25:22,184
<i>- Oh, God, I never learn.
- No, you don't. [Laughs]</i>

451
00:25:22,185 --> 00:25:23,218
<i>[Jeff] All right, all right.</i>

452
00:25:23,219 --> 00:25:24,219
<i>Anyway, a few hours later,</i>

453
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,688
<i>I get a call from Nealy.</i>

454
00:25:25,689 --> 00:25:27,357
<i>- She's read all my emails.
- No!</i>

455
00:25:27,358 --> 00:25:30,293
<i>[Jeff] Yeah. Suffice to say,
she is not too pleased.</i>

456
00:25:30,294 --> 00:25:33,263
<i>- [Rebecca groans]
- Of course, I can't leave to go talk to her in person.</i>

457
00:25:33,264 --> 00:25:36,333
<i>My patient's labor's going on
all night, so the next morning,</i>

458
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:38,299
<i>I have some flowers
delivered to her store</i>

459
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,102
<i>- with a very cheesy love poem.
- [laughs]</i>

460
00:25:40,103 --> 00:25:42,304
<i>But when I finally get home,
she's still at her shop,</i>

461
00:25:42,305 --> 00:25:44,275
<i>so I go for a run
to clear my head</i>

462
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:47,076
<i>and I decide to make a whole
romantic dinner for her.</i>

463
00:25:47,077 --> 00:25:48,644
<i>It was going great.</i>

464
00:25:48,645 --> 00:25:50,314
<i>It seems like
we were really communicating</i>

465
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:52,248
<i>until she just gets weird.</i>

466
00:25:52,249 --> 00:25:54,851
<i>She gets really emotional,
really serious,</i>

467
00:25:54,852 --> 00:25:56,619
<i>and then she says
something like,</i>

468
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,952
<i>"I think about going out</i>

469
00:25:57,953 --> 00:25:59,321
<i>and fucking other people,
too." [laughs]</i>

470
00:25:59,322 --> 00:26:01,690
<i>- [Rebecca laughs]
- I don't know, it was so weird.</i>

471
00:26:01,691 --> 00:26:02,757
<i>It just gets weird.</i>

472
00:26:02,758 --> 00:26:04,025
<i>She turns and she runs off</i>

I don't know.
What are you about to say?

630
00:35:07,503 --> 00:35:10,406
Well, look, I took
the liberty of contacting

631
00:35:10,407 --> 00:35:12,542
a friend of a friend
who runs a middle school.

632
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:14,577
It's a good school
with a serious athletic program.

633
00:35:14,578 --> 00:35:17,647
Turns out a coach
over there is leaving

634
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:20,549
and they'd love to interview you
if you're interested.

635
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:23,785
I hope that's not insulting.

636
00:35:23,786 --> 00:35:25,955
Oh, no, Doc.

I'm... touched.

you're doing this for me?

I just...

I guess I just felt like it.

00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,669
Here, um...

642
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:43,506
Here's the coach's
name and number.

643
00:35:43,507 --> 00:35:44,775
He's expecting your call.

My number's on there too,
just in case.

to try to make it up to you.

794
00:45:55,117 --> 00:45:57,118
So in a few days,

795
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,221
when you've
had a chance to mourn,

796
00:45:59,222 --> 00:46:01,422
we can get coffee
and discuss it.

797
00:46:01,423 --> 00:46:03,192
- I'd like that.
- Good.

798
00:46:03,193 --> 00:46:04,527
- I'd really like that.
- Good.

799
00:46:04,528 --> 00:46:06,194
OK, great. Now...

800
00:46:06,195 --> 00:46:07,995
- Dr. Lang?
- Yeah?

801
00:46:07,996 --> 00:46:10,302
I had a really funny dream
a few nights ago.

802
00:46:13,302 --> 00:46:16,171
You and I, we lived
in the countryside.

803
00:46:16,172 --> 00:46:18,541
In England.

804
00:46:19,541 --> 00:46:22,511
And we rode horses everywhere.

805
00:46:22,512 --> 00:46:24,446
And mine was a...

806
00:46:24,447 --> 00:46:27,415
Oh, he was a big white stallion

807
00:46:27,416 --> 00:46:31,185
with a silvery mane. And yours
was a beautiful Arabian.

808
00:46:31,186 --> 00:46:32,921
And we were in the forest...

809
00:46:32,922 --> 00:46:35,323
...and the light was dim,

810
00:46:35,324 --> 00:46:37,625
and we were galloping
past each other,

811
00:46:37,626 --> 00:46:41,330
we were passing each other by
when we both...

812
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:44,466
...we made our animals stop.

813
00:46:44,467 --> 00:46:49,071
<i>I mean, I know you could say
it was just a dream</i>

814
00:46:49,072 --> 00:46:50,608
but it...

815
00:46:51,608 --> 00:46:55,310
What happened next felt...

816
00:46:55,311 --> 00:46:57,384
It felt very real to me.

817
00:47:01,384 --> 00:47:05,220
And... if you would

818
00:47:05,221 --> 00:47:08,422
like me to show you
what I did...

819
00:47:08,423 --> 00:47:11,093
You, you don't,
you don't even have to agree,

820
00:47:11,094 --> 00:47:15,032
just... just don't disagree.

821
00:47:16,032 --> 00:47:19,201
And then it will be like...

822
00:47:19,202 --> 00:47:21,407
...you're not doing
anything at all.

823
00:47:24,407 --> 00:47:27,248
I wouldn't want
you to get in trouble.

Peter Mazzoni stopped by

working on some deal together?

Right, yeah. Uh...

in a new restaurant of his.

- Really?
- Yeah. Yeah.

Wow, well, everything that guy
touches turns to gold.

867
00:50:01,098 --> 00:50:02,599
Maybe we should consider it.

868

Yeah, maybe.

00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:03,158
Afternoon.

876
00:51:03,159 --> 00:51:05,593
I heard you stopped by
my house.

877
00:51:05,594 --> 00:51:09,800
Yeah. There's no restraining
order on me yet, is there?

878
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,334
- What do you want?
- What do I want?

879
00:51:13,335 --> 00:51:17,138
I wanna fuck your wife
up the ass

880
00:51:17,139 --> 00:51:19,509
while your two year old watches
me hack you into bits.

881
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:21,442
That's what I want.

882
00:51:21,443 --> 00:51:23,712
I've decided not to do it.

883
00:51:23,713 --> 00:51:25,680
OK.

884
00:51:25,681 --> 00:51:27,650
Instead, I'm gonna
offer you a choice.

885
00:51:27,651 --> 00:51:30,352
You pick up this phone,
right now,

886
00:51:30,353 --> 00:51:33,626
you call your wife and you tell
her what you did or...

887
00:51:37,626 --> 00:51:39,461
...or you give me
a hundred thousand dollars

888
00:51:39,462 --> 00:51:42,643
in cash for my silence.

889
00:51:54,643 --> 00:51:55,480
Hey.

890
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:00,784

- Of course.

So am I fucked?

892
00:52:05,554 --> 00:52:08,293
What do you think?

893
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:12,459
I think he's a...

894
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:15,330
...an Italian guy
from New Jersey

895

No problem.

So... I'm sorry,
I couldn't get it all.

915
00:54:34,336 --> 00:54:38,038
We haven't saved much
since we bought our house

916
00:54:38,039 --> 00:54:41,442

Why in the world
did you just do that?

Well, now you have.

By the way,
Becca and I are done,

924

to go take advantage

and poke around
that cumhole all you want

926
00:55:20,816 --> 00:55:23,655
'cause I don't care anymore.

927
00:55:27,655 --> 00:55:30,924
I gave you a choice.
I gave you a choice, Jeffrey.

928
00:55:30,925 --> 00:55:32,862
You could've told your wife
the truth

929
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:34,428
instead of meetin' me here.

930
00:55:34,429 --> 00:55:38,566
You could've been a good guy,
but no, you're a rat,

931
00:55:38,567 --> 00:55:39,933
just like my wife.

932
00:55:39,934 --> 00:55:42,437
You're a little punk rat,

933
00:55:42,438 --> 00:55:45,473
a boy man rat. Look at you.

934
00:55:45,474 --> 00:55:47,943
Just look at you.

935
00:55:48,943 --> 00:55:50,779
And you deserve a lot worse

936
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:54,519
than losing some petty
cash to the Skagit River.

937
00:55:57,519 --> 00:56:00,855
You know, when I
discovered what you did,

938
00:56:00,856 --> 00:56:03,691
I was gonna kill you.

939
00:56:03,692 --> 00:56:05,794
But then I remembered

940
00:56:05,795 --> 00:56:08,062
I'm not that kind of man.

941
00:56:08,063 --> 00:56:11,165
I'm the kind of man
who makes a mistake

942
00:56:11,166 --> 00:56:12,801
and then makes amends.

943
00:56:12,802 --> 00:56:15,537
I'm the kind of man who got into
a drunk driving accident

944
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:18,071
and nearly killed a kid,
but did I get some fancy-pants

945
00:56:18,072 --> 00:56:22,142
lawyer to get me off scot-free 'cause I
was just below the legal limit? Uh-uh!

946
00:56:22,143 --> 00:56:24,044
I prayed for forgiveness,

947
00:56:24,045 --> 00:56:26,016
and I pled guilty.
And when the judge ordered me

948
00:56:27,016 --> 00:56:29,517
to pay a million dollars
to the kid's family

949
00:56:29,518 --> 00:56:32,553
and he sent me to jail
for a month, did I stop there?

950
00:56:32,554 --> 00:56:37,524
No. I started helping people.
Volunteering.

951
00:56:37,525 --> 00:56:39,593
Philanthropy.

952
00:56:39,594 --> 00:56:43,134
'Cause that's
the kind of guy I am.

953
00:56:45,134 --> 00:56:46,969
You may wish you're that
kinda man,

954
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:49,471
but you're not.

955
00:56:49,472 --> 00:56:52,882
You're a scumbag home-wrecker.

956
00:56:59,882 --> 00:57:02,119
You wrecked my home, Jeffrey.

957
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:07,023
You wrecked my home.

958
00:57:09,023 --> 00:57:13,660
And I could just as easily
wreck yours with one phone call.

959
00:57:13,661 --> 00:57:16,631
But I don't need to do that.

960
00:57:16,632 --> 00:57:19,100
Because you're the kinda guy

961
00:57:19,101 --> 00:57:22,740
who's gonna
fuck it all up himself.

<i>So guess what?
I got the job, Doc.</i>

00:58:24,833 --> 00:58:27,634
No kidding, that's great news.

969
00:58:27,635 --> 00:58:29,038
<i>Actually, I start tomorrow.</i>

970

<i>And to celebrate,
this weekend my wife and I</i>

dialysis machine right now.</i>

[chatter]

979
00:58:54,630 --> 00:58:56,263
Thanks for visiting me, Doc.

980
00:58:56,264 --> 00:58:59,232
Nobody ever visits me here.

981
00:58:59,233 --> 00:59:01,672
Of course.

982

So I hope you don't mind
me askin',

983
00:59:06,642 --> 00:59:10,678
I was just wondering what your
doctor says in terms of, uh,

984
00:59:10,679 --> 00:59:13,046
how long it is before
your kidneys fail?

985
00:59:13,047 --> 00:59:16,084
A couple years, if I'm lucky.

986
00:59:16,085 --> 00:59:18,118
So they say.

987
00:59:18,119 --> 00:59:20,221
But I'm feeling strong,

988
00:59:20,222 --> 00:59:21,756
and the way I see it,

989
00:59:21,757 --> 00:59:25,093
if God can create
the earth in seven days,

990
00:59:25,094 --> 00:59:26,960
why can't I get lucky

991
00:59:26,961 --> 00:59:30,103
and find myself a kidney
in the next year or two?

992
00:59:35,103 --> 00:59:36,671
Hey, Doc.

993
00:59:36,672 --> 00:59:39,374
I hope I didn't depress
you with that.

994
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:40,975
Today's a really good day.

995
00:59:40,976 --> 00:59:43,282
I know, yeah, yeah, of course.

996
00:59:48,282 --> 00:59:50,317
- To Doc.
- To Doc.

997
00:59:50,318 --> 00:59:51,352
A saint.

998
00:59:51,353 --> 00:59:52,886
[chuckles] Oh, not a saint.

Well, in my book you are.

1000

And one heck of a
basketball player.

1001
00:59:56,224 --> 00:59:58,426
[chuckles] Oh, now
are you just saying that

1002
00:59:58,427 --> 01:00:00,627
- to make him feel good?
- [Lincoln] Well, let me tell you,

1003
01:00:00,762 --> 01:00:03,230
if your husband understood
how to play defense,

1004
01:00:03,231 --> 01:00:05,333
had a better jump shot,
and was about six foot nine,

1005
01:00:05,334 --> 01:00:07,768
he'd be killin' 'em
in the NBA right now.

1006
01:00:07,769 --> 01:00:09,239
[laughing]

1007
01:00:11,239 --> 01:00:14,107
Hey, hey, you mind if I
say a prayer before we eat?

1008
01:00:14,108 --> 01:00:16,414
Of course not.

1009
01:00:19,414 --> 01:00:21,114
Dear Heavenly Father,

1010
01:00:21,115 --> 01:00:23,018
we thank you for the food
that's been prepared before us,

1011
01:00:24,018 --> 01:00:26,155
for the nourishment
and strengthening of our bodies.

1012
01:00:26,156 --> 01:00:28,156
In the name of Christ Jesus,
amen.

1013
01:00:28,157 --> 01:00:29,025
[all] Amen.

1014
01:00:30,025 --> 01:00:32,794
- All right, you guys can eat.
- Whoo.

1015
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:35,263
May I have the salt and pepper?

1016
01:00:35,264 --> 01:00:38,899
So you haven't told me
how the team is yet.

1017
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:41,335
Doc, these girls hustle
like you wouldn't believe.

1018
01:00:41,336 --> 01:00:43,971
And there's some talent
on the team, too.

1019
01:00:43,972 --> 01:00:45,473
Oh, that's great.

1020
01:00:45,474 --> 01:00:47,442
Really great.

1021
01:00:47,443 --> 01:00:48,875
But I've gotta tell you,

1022
01:00:48,876 --> 01:00:52,046
what I like
the best about it is

1023
01:00:52,047 --> 01:00:55,487
my kids are finally excited about
something their daddy does.

1024
01:00:58,487 --> 01:01:00,187
Thank you, Doc.

1025
01:01:00,188 --> 01:01:01,157
You made this possible, bro.

1026
01:01:03,157 --> 01:01:06,426
[exhales] You changed
my life, Doc.

1027
01:01:06,427 --> 01:01:08,030
So why can't Angela donate?

1028
01:01:09,030 --> 01:01:11,400
Oh, she has some kind of
congenital heart defect,

1029
01:01:11,401 --> 01:01:13,401
which means an operation
would be risky.

1030
01:01:13,402 --> 01:01:14,801
[car alarm beeps]

1031
01:01:14,802 --> 01:01:18,439
He seems so alive,
you know, and healthy.

1032
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:22,280
He's so far down on the list to
get a transplant it's not funny.

1033
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:28,915
I know it's kind of
an absurd thought, but...

1034
01:01:28,916 --> 01:01:31,788
...why shouldn't it be me?

1035
01:01:32,788 --> 01:01:37,364
Here, I've been
doing a little research.

1036
01:01:42,364 --> 01:01:45,899
"Living organ donation."

1037
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:47,368
Wow.

1038
01:01:47,369 --> 01:01:49,403
OK, you're serious.

1039
01:01:49,404 --> 01:01:52,406
You've been thinking
about this for a while.

1040
01:01:52,407 --> 01:01:54,942
Well, a bit.

1041
01:01:54,943 --> 01:01:58,414
[exhales] This is...

1042
01:02:00,414 --> 01:02:02,116
This is amazing.

1043
01:02:02,117 --> 01:02:04,484
I'm just, I'm, I'm worried,

1044
01:02:04,485 --> 01:02:08,455
uh, what if Miles
needs your kidney one day?

1045
01:02:08,456 --> 01:02:12,093
Well, I thought that we could do
a test to make sure both

1046
01:02:12,094 --> 01:02:14,227
you and Miles
have healthy kidneys,

1047
01:02:14,228 --> 01:02:15,030
and if so,

1048
01:02:16,030 --> 01:02:18,966
the risk is incredibly small.

1049
01:02:18,967 --> 01:02:22,371
I'm not opposed
to doing some tests.

1050
01:02:23,371 --> 01:02:26,573
I actually think it's a
really wonderful thought

1051
01:02:26,574 --> 01:02:29,215
to do something truly selfless.

1052
01:02:34,215 --> 01:02:37,003
[chuckles] You weren't
expecting this. [Laughs]

1058
01:03:06,347 --> 01:03:09,049
Hey, Doc.
What are you doin' here?

1059
01:03:09,050 --> 01:03:10,384
How's it goin'?

1060
01:03:10,385 --> 01:03:12,320
It's goin' great.
The girls are great.

1061
01:03:12,321 --> 01:03:15,488
Yeah. Uh, I come
bearing some good news.

1062
01:03:15,489 --> 01:03:17,258
You know I like good news.

1063
01:03:17,259 --> 01:03:19,126
After dinner at your house,
my wife and I were talking

1064
01:03:19,127 --> 01:03:22,062
about your,
your health situation.

1065
01:03:22,063 --> 01:03:24,332
And um, long story short,

1066
01:03:24,333 --> 01:03:26,501
the last few weeks have been
all about kidney donation

1067
01:03:26,502 --> 01:03:29,035
and we have researched it,
talked about it,

1068
01:03:29,036 --> 01:03:32,073
done a bunch of tests,
and we came to agree

1069
01:03:32,074 --> 01:03:33,876
that it was
the right thing to do.

1070
01:03:33,877 --> 01:03:35,442
So I called your doctor and...

1071
01:03:35,443 --> 01:03:37,377
Whoa, wait a minute.

1072
01:03:37,378 --> 01:03:38,914
Are you saying what
I think you're sayin'?

1073
01:03:38,915 --> 01:03:42,116
We are a perfect match,
Lincoln.

everything.

one of his kidneys!

Oh. My minister came by to
visit me this morning.

1114
01:06:00,621 --> 01:06:03,656
And we were talking about what
a miracle it is, what you did,

1115
01:06:03,657 --> 01:06:07,395
and he had the idea to do
a special service in your honor.

1116
01:06:07,396 --> 01:06:09,029
I don't need to be honored.

1117
01:06:09,030 --> 01:06:10,531
Wouldn't be
for your vanity, Doc.

1118
01:06:10,532 --> 01:06:12,533
It'd be for our congregation,

1119
01:06:12,534 --> 01:06:15,737
to inspire them to do
their own charity work.

1120
01:06:16,737 --> 01:06:20,341
I think it would be,
you know, painless.

1121
01:06:20,342 --> 01:06:23,743
But if you'd prefer not to...

1122
01:06:23,744 --> 01:06:26,814
No. I'll do it.

1123
01:06:26,815 --> 01:06:28,649
Sounds like a good idea.

1124
01:06:28,650 --> 01:06:31,118
[exhales]

1125
01:06:31,119 --> 01:06:33,438
It is.

1126
01:06:50,438 --> 01:06:52,509
Aloha.

1127
01:06:54,509 --> 01:06:56,843
I brought you this basil plant.

1128
01:06:56,844 --> 01:07:00,113
These hospitals are so toxic.

1129
01:07:00,114 --> 01:07:02,082
So many germs.

1130
01:07:02,083 --> 01:07:04,285
Thank you. So...

1131
01:07:04,286 --> 01:07:06,453
...how'd you know
to find me here?

1132
01:07:06,454 --> 01:07:08,455
You're in the paper.

1133
01:07:08,456 --> 01:07:11,392
What, didn't you know?

1134
01:07:11,393 --> 01:07:14,160
What a wonderful thing
you did for him,

1135
01:07:14,161 --> 01:07:17,631
saving his life, getting him
the job, everything.

1136
01:07:17,632 --> 01:07:22,870
No doubt... you will reap
the positive karma

1137
01:07:22,871 --> 01:07:25,309
of this for a long time.

1138
01:07:27,309 --> 01:07:30,845
Um... speaking of karma,

1139
01:07:30,846 --> 01:07:34,180
there's something
I need to tell you,

1140
01:07:34,181 --> 01:07:38,252
which may slam the karmic
wheel of fate down on me hard.

1141
01:07:38,253 --> 01:07:39,386
Um...

1142
01:07:39,387 --> 01:07:42,159
I know I shouldn't
have done it...

1143
01:07:44,159 --> 01:07:46,861
but after Matthew was poisoned

1144
01:07:46,862 --> 01:07:49,629
and before our...

1145
01:07:49,630 --> 01:07:51,832
[chuckles] ...you know...

1146
01:07:51,833 --> 01:07:55,870
...I was seeing red
and I called

1147
01:07:55,871 --> 01:07:57,539
the Department
of Building and Safety

1148
01:07:57,540 --> 01:08:00,441
and told them
about your construction.

1149
01:08:00,442 --> 01:08:03,143
Anyway, they
finally came by yesterday

1150
01:08:03,144 --> 01:08:05,753
and they...
they put this on your door.

1151
01:08:12,753 --> 01:08:15,256
I am really sorry, Jeffrey.

1152
01:08:15,257 --> 01:08:17,625
[exhales] I, I...

1153
01:08:17,626 --> 01:08:19,459
...probably would've done
the same thing

1154
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:21,328
- if you'd killed my pet.
- [exhales]

1155
01:08:21,329 --> 01:08:23,201
[chuckles]

1156
01:08:26,201 --> 01:08:27,835
There's something else.

1157
01:08:27,836 --> 01:08:29,803
I'm pregnant.

1158
01:08:29,804 --> 01:08:31,345
With your baby.

1159
01:08:38,345 --> 01:08:40,447
I know what you're thinking.

1160
01:08:40,448 --> 01:08:42,750
But you don't need
to be worried.

1161
01:08:42,751 --> 01:08:45,219
It's all gonna be all right.

1162
01:08:45,220 --> 01:08:46,519
It will all work out.

1163
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:49,255
Things always do.

1164
01:08:49,256 --> 01:08:52,538
No. Things don't
always work out.

1165
01:09:04,538 --> 01:09:06,353
You want me to kill it,
don't you?

1166
01:09:18,353 --> 01:09:19,524
[clears throat]

1167
01:09:23,524 --> 01:09:28,528
[screaming]

1168
01:09:28,529 --> 01:09:29,831
[Miles]
I wanna go in the house.

1169
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:31,734
[Nealy sighs] We're goin'.

1170
01:09:32,734 --> 01:09:35,873
[groans] OK.

1171
01:09:39,873 --> 01:09:41,744
[sighs]

1172
01:09:43,744 --> 01:09:45,845
I thought about
fixing it myself,

1173
01:09:45,846 --> 01:09:48,287
but it just didn't
seem worth it.

1174
01:09:53,287 --> 01:09:54,423
[chuckles]

1175
01:09:56,423 --> 01:09:58,591
[Lila] Don't worry, it's decaf.

1176
01:09:58,592 --> 01:10:01,362
I, I would never poison
our baby with a

1177
01:10:01,363 --> 01:10:03,796
double shot of real espresso.

1178
01:10:03,797 --> 01:10:06,466
They say it can cause autism.

1179
01:10:06,467 --> 01:10:08,369
Then again,
you're the baby doctor.

1180
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:10,703
Hey, can I ask, um...

1181
01:10:10,704 --> 01:10:14,340
Are you one hundred percent
certain that you're pregnant?

1182
01:10:14,341 --> 01:10:15,975
Yes.

1183
01:10:15,976 --> 01:10:19,779
[whispering] I took the test
twice, I peed twice,

1184
01:10:19,780 --> 01:10:21,514
- just to make sure.
- Lila...

1185
01:10:21,515 --> 01:10:23,817
Do you really think,
in your heart,

1186
01:10:23,818 --> 01:10:25,487
that this is the right
thing to do,

1187
01:10:25,488 --> 01:10:28,322
for you and I to be
having a baby together?

1188
01:10:28,323 --> 01:10:30,691
Oh... absolutely.
It's a miracle.

1189
01:10:30,692 --> 01:10:32,393
- No.
- Yes, Jeff.

1190
01:10:32,394 --> 01:10:33,492
I feel the life
growing inside of me.

1191
01:10:33,493 --> 01:10:34,796
- No, Lila,
- I can feel it

1192
01:10:34,797 --> 01:10:36,697
- blooming
- Lila, please.

1193
01:10:36,698 --> 01:10:39,566
- and blossoming and growing.
- Lila, please. Lila. Look...

1194
01:10:39,567 --> 01:10:42,670
Lila! What fuckin'
planet do you live on?!

1195
01:10:42,671 --> 01:10:46,040
There is no way, no chance under
any circumstance,

1196
01:10:46,041 --> 01:10:48,975
that I'll be fathering
a child with you.

1197
01:10:48,976 --> 01:10:51,545
Jeffrey, I want you
to understand

1198
01:10:51,546 --> 01:10:53,313
that once our little one
is born

1199
01:10:53,314 --> 01:10:55,916
I'm not expecting child support

1200
01:10:55,917 --> 01:10:58,452
or anything like that.

1201
01:10:58,453 --> 01:11:00,788
I just want our little one
to grow up knowing his father.

1202
01:11:00,789 --> 01:11:03,624
And if you think about it,
it's perfect.

1203
01:11:03,625 --> 01:11:04,993
The little one
will be right next door.

1204
01:11:04,994 --> 01:11:08,461
You can come by and visit
any time you like.

1205
01:11:08,462 --> 01:11:10,531
You can be like
the charming uncle

1206
01:11:10,532 --> 01:11:13,103
and that... that wife of
yours never has to find out.

1207
01:11:15,103 --> 01:11:16,903
She won't know.

1208
01:11:16,904 --> 01:11:18,404
Bye.

1209
01:11:18,405 --> 01:11:21,508
[baby crying]

1210
01:11:21,509 --> 01:11:23,613
See you later.

1211
01:11:25,613 --> 01:11:27,654
[knocking]

1212
01:11:32,654 --> 01:11:34,698
[baby continues crying]

1213

[yelling]

1214
01:12:11,091 --> 01:12:13,926
[Lila] I... I don't have
any medical insurance

1215
01:12:13,927 --> 01:12:16,662
so I thought maybe

1216
01:12:16,663 --> 01:12:19,774
you could help me out.

1217
01:12:26,774 --> 01:12:29,876
You wouldn't put anything
up there

1218
01:12:29,877 --> 01:12:31,081
that would hurt
the baby, would you?

1219
01:12:33,081 --> 01:12:35,157
No. I wouldn't do that.

1220
01:12:42,157 --> 01:12:44,726
[Lila] Does that mean...?

1221
01:12:45,726 --> 01:12:47,034
- It's alive.
- [chuckles]

1222
01:12:54,034 --> 01:12:56,036
[Lincoln] Dang, Doc.

1223
01:12:56,037 --> 01:13:00,109
That's a pretty tight spot
this woman's got you in.

1224
01:13:02,109 --> 01:13:04,812
You know,
Doc, my mother used to say,

1225
01:13:04,813 --> 01:13:10,850
"It's impossible to reason
with an unreasonable person."

1226
01:13:10,851 --> 01:13:12,619
I think that's what
you're dealing with,

1227
01:13:12,620 --> 01:13:14,890
with this woman here.

1228
01:13:16,890 --> 01:13:19,827
I can barely see straight.

1229
01:13:19,828 --> 01:13:23,897
And the things I'm thinking,
you, you couldn't imagine.

1230
01:13:23,898 --> 01:13:25,100
Like what?

1231
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:29,202
Like all day...

1232
01:13:29,203 --> 01:13:32,139
...I'm fantasizing
about her dying.

1233
01:13:32,140 --> 01:13:36,609
I must've imagined it
a hundred different ways.

1234
01:13:36,610 --> 01:13:40,246
Actually, last night,
I had a dream about it.

1235
01:13:40,247 --> 01:13:45,520
A wish fulfillment dream,
huh, Doc?

1236
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:48,061
I guess so.

1237
01:13:54,061 --> 01:13:55,131
What was it?

1238
01:13:58,131 --> 01:14:00,569
[sighs] It was ridiculous.

1239
01:14:02,569 --> 01:14:05,037
There were these two
football players

1240
01:14:05,038 --> 01:14:07,640
runnin' through the woods
in the park by my house

1241
01:14:07,641 --> 01:14:09,742
where I sometimes go jogging

1242
01:14:09,743 --> 01:14:13,114
and I see her walking her
little dog every night at dusk.

1243
01:14:14,114 --> 01:14:16,148
They're just galloping
through the woods

1244
01:14:16,149 --> 01:14:19,685
in full game day uniforms.

1247
01:14:25,627 --> 01:14:29,965
I realize it's an arrow.

1248
01:14:30,965 --> 01:14:33,671
It splits her head wide open.

1249
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:40,206
I woke up totally relieved.

1250
01:14:40,207 --> 01:14:44,782
Until I realized
it was just a dream.

1251
01:14:47,782 --> 01:14:49,722
Sick, huh?

1252
01:14:55,722 --> 01:14:57,724
It's gonna be all right, Doc.

It's gonna be all right.

1256
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:54,915
Meredith just called and said

1257
01:15:54,916 --> 01:15:58,795
that Peter and Rebecca
are getting divorced.

1258

When suddenly,
Mom noticed something amiss.

Something weird, something
crazy, a real mystery this!

'Where are the socks?'

1263
01:16:22,042 --> 01:16:23,943

1269

Miles' toy box?</i>

It happened in the park.
Less than a mile away.

01:19:14,015 --> 01:19:16,148
The police are now going
door to door.

1295

[sighs] Sort of puts a damper
on tonight's celebration,

[Lincoln] That's a plane,
you know what that is.

1303
01:21:24,478 --> 01:21:26,010
No, that.

1304
01:21:26,012 --> 01:21:28,667
Oh, that?
I don't know what that is.

1305
01:21:46,667 --> 01:21:49,211
That was pretty moving, huh?

1306
01:21:57,211 --> 01:21:59,649
Where, where are we going?

1307
01:22:02,649 --> 01:22:03,564
Hey.

1308
01:22:17,564 --> 01:22:20,666
[Jeff] I cheated my way
through med school.

1309
01:22:20,667 --> 01:22:22,268
What?

1310
01:22:22,269 --> 01:22:25,572
Cheat sheets.
Very elaborate,

1311
01:22:25,573 --> 01:22:29,645
written on little pieces
of paper in every pocket.

[sighs]

1313
01:22:34,782 --> 01:22:37,416
When I was a kid,
I had this doctor

1314
01:22:37,417 --> 01:22:40,653
who misdiagnosed
my chicken pox as dermatitis.

1315
01:22:40,654 --> 01:22:44,323
I almost died.
Did I ever tell you that?

1316
01:22:44,324 --> 01:22:46,395
No.

1317
01:22:48,395 --> 01:22:50,496
While I was in the hospital,

1318
01:22:50,497 --> 01:22:53,166
my mother and grandmother
were sitting around,

1319
01:22:53,167 --> 01:22:55,335
I overheard my grandmother say,

1320
01:22:55,336 --> 01:22:58,537
"Well, I guess not all
doctors made A's."

1321
01:22:58,538 --> 01:23:03,675
Turns out, I became
one of those doctors.

1322
01:23:03,676 --> 01:23:06,712
I am a "study
at the last minute,

...fuckhead, C-plus" doctor.

1325
01:23:15,456 --> 01:23:17,132
You're a great doctor.

1326
01:23:26,132 --> 01:23:27,367
Look.

1327
01:23:27,368 --> 01:23:29,736

- What are you doing?!
- [tires screeching]

1331
01:23:35,077 --> 01:23:36,643
Jeff, stop! Don't!

- [gasps] Stop the car!
- [thuds]

1336
01:23:45,819 --> 01:23:47,187
Oh, my God!

1337
01:23:47,188 --> 01:23:50,223
Stop it! Stop! No!

1338
01:23:50,224 --> 01:23:53,628
You are freaking me out.

1339
01:23:55,628 --> 01:23:59,566
What is going on?
[breathes heavily]

1340
01:23:59,567 --> 01:24:02,203
I fucked Rebecca.

1341
01:24:03,203 --> 01:24:04,636
What?

1342
01:24:04,637 --> 01:24:07,511
[breathes heavily]

1343
01:24:10,511 --> 01:24:13,880
I don't mean to hurt you
telling you this.

1344
01:24:13,881 --> 01:24:15,614
- [chuckles]
- I'm just trying to

1345
01:24:15,615 --> 01:24:18,751
tell you the
truth for a change.

1346
01:24:18,752 --> 01:24:22,791
Rebecca Mazzoni.

1347
01:24:23,791 --> 01:24:25,228
[scoffs]

1348
01:24:27,228 --> 01:24:31,563
- I only fucked her once.
- Oh, great. Good.

1349
01:24:31,564 --> 01:24:33,765
But Peter found out.

1350
01:24:33,766 --> 01:24:35,667
[sniffs]

1351
01:24:35,668 --> 01:24:38,203
In the meantime...

1352
01:24:38,204 --> 01:24:40,708
...I accidentally...

1353
01:24:41,708 --> 01:24:43,742
...poisoned Lila's cat

1354
01:24:43,743 --> 01:24:46,145
trying to get the raccoons.

1355
01:24:46,146 --> 01:24:49,715
All in the same day.

1356
01:24:49,716 --> 01:24:53,688
She followed me to work to
confront me about Matthew...

1357
01:24:54,688 --> 01:24:57,890
...that's her cat...

1358
01:24:57,891 --> 01:25:00,326
...and Peter shows up

1359
01:25:00,327 --> 01:25:04,332
to confront me about Rebecca.

1360
01:25:06,332 --> 01:25:08,835
And Lila takes off
without saying a word,

1361
01:25:08,836 --> 01:25:12,705
so when I go to see
what she wanted...

1362
01:25:12,706 --> 01:25:14,411
[sighs]

1363
01:25:17,411 --> 01:25:20,813
...she comes on to me.

1364
01:25:20,814 --> 01:25:24,349
- And she goes absolutely fucking ballistic.
- Oh, my God.

1365
01:25:24,350 --> 01:25:29,488
- Threatens to tell you everything and...
- Oh, my God.

1366
01:25:29,489 --> 01:25:31,625
...I guess a part of me wanted
to have sex with her

1367
01:25:31,626 --> 01:25:34,895
- because I did.
- [gasps and laughs]

1368
01:25:35,895 --> 01:25:37,502
[exhales]

1369
01:25:41,502 --> 01:25:43,469
Wow.

1370
01:25:43,470 --> 01:25:46,206
Wow. [Chuckles]

1371
01:25:46,207 --> 01:25:47,907
Nealy...

1372
01:25:47,908 --> 01:25:50,412
...uh...

1373
01:25:51,412 --> 01:25:55,219
...so far this has been
the good news.

1374
01:25:58,219 --> 01:26:00,721
She, uh...

1375
01:26:01,721 --> 01:26:03,822
...she got pregnant.

1376
01:26:03,823 --> 01:26:06,395
Who got pregnant?

1377
01:26:08,395 --> 01:26:10,631
Lila.

1378
01:26:11,631 --> 01:26:13,366
Oh, God.

1379
01:26:13,367 --> 01:26:15,768
[breathes heavily] What?

1380
01:26:15,769 --> 01:26:18,006
The chances of it happening
that one time

1381
01:26:19,006 --> 01:26:20,943
at her age are...

1382
01:26:22,943 --> 01:26:25,678
I...

1383
01:26:25,679 --> 01:26:28,386
[breathes heavily] What?

1384
01:26:32,386 --> 01:26:34,858
But here comes the kicker.

1385
01:26:37,858 --> 01:26:41,529
I didn't know who to confide in.

1386
01:26:42,529 --> 01:26:44,032
So I visited...

1387
01:26:45,032 --> 01:26:46,868
...Lincoln.

1388
01:26:47,868 --> 01:26:50,872
We're sitting there...

1389
01:26:52,872 --> 01:26:55,340
...and I mention to him

1390
01:26:55,341 --> 01:26:58,611
a dream I had...

1391
01:26:58,612 --> 01:27:00,712
...where Lila's
killed with an arrow.

1392
01:27:00,713 --> 01:27:02,547
[gasps] Oh, my God.

1393
01:27:02,548 --> 01:27:04,050
Oh, my God.

1394
01:27:04,051 --> 01:27:06,551
Nealy, I was just
venting to him.

1395
01:27:06,552 --> 01:27:08,353
Oh, my God, Jeff.

1396
01:27:08,354 --> 01:27:12,560
- I didn't ask him to do it.
- Oh, my God.

1397
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:15,896
[breathes heavily]

1398
01:27:16,896 --> 01:27:19,703
But he did it.

1399
01:27:23,703 --> 01:27:26,572
[breathes heavily]

1400
01:27:26,573 --> 01:27:30,412
This is real?
This really fucking happened?

1401
01:27:31,412 --> 01:27:33,880
Oh, my God, Jeff!

1402
01:27:33,881 --> 01:27:37,317
Jesus! Jesus!

1403
01:27:37,318 --> 01:27:40,086
[breathes heavily]

1404
01:27:40,087 --> 01:27:43,393
[laughs]

1405
01:27:46,393 --> 01:27:48,329
Oh, my God.

1406
01:27:49,329 --> 01:27:51,930
Oh, my God.

1407
01:27:51,931 --> 01:27:55,867
Oh, my God.

1408
01:27:55,868 --> 01:27:59,675
[laughs]

1409
01:28:01,675 --> 01:28:05,545
I don't know why I'm laughing.

1410
01:28:05,546 --> 01:28:07,984
I don't know.

1411
01:28:11,984 --> 01:28:15,060
[laughing continues]

1412
01:28:20,060 --> 01:28:21,538
[sniffs]

1413
01:28:32,538 --> 01:28:34,585
[sniffs, laughs]

1414
01:28:44,585 --> 01:28:46,786
Don't fucking come near me.

1415
01:28:46,787 --> 01:28:48,926
[sniffs, exhales]

1416
01:28:52,926 --> 01:28:54,000
I fucked somebody, too.

1417
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,002
Before that, that big fight
we had about the raccoons.

1418
01:29:03,002 --> 01:29:05,138
Those stupid raccoons.

1419
01:29:05,139 --> 01:29:06,872
I was fucking somebody.

1420
01:29:06,873 --> 01:29:08,040
[laughs]

1421
01:29:08,041 --> 01:29:10,777
I was having
an affair for months.

1422
01:29:10,778 --> 01:29:12,719
Six months. [Sniffs]

1423
01:29:18,719 --> 01:29:20,685
He was a customer.

1424
01:29:20,686 --> 01:29:22,721
[coughs, sniffs]

1425
01:29:22,722 --> 01:29:25,625
I helped him pick out fabric.

1426
01:29:25,626 --> 01:29:29,934
It was blue corduroy.
[chuckles]

1427
01:29:33,934 --> 01:29:36,868
He worked at the wine shop
down the street.

1428
01:29:36,869 --> 01:29:41,447
<i>He'd bring me plates
of cheese and salami.</i>

1429
01:29:46,447 --> 01:29:48,716
It's over now.

1430
01:29:49,716 --> 01:29:51,050
OK.

1431
01:29:51,051 --> 01:29:53,786
OK. Yeah.

1432
01:29:53,787 --> 01:29:56,656
Yeah, OK.
