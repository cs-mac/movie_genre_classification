00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:39,365
He hit me harder than I expected.

468
00:35:41,572 --> 00:35:44,200
I was tempted and fell.

469
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:49,475
It was then that I first tasted bitter shame.

470
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:55,246
I'd never had a happy moment after that
until I'd knelt and asked his forgiveness... -

471
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:58,151
by his bedside in the hospital.

472
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:03,287
Now I have learned to resist...

473
00:36:03,394 --> 00:36:05,794
with a strength that is not my own.

474
00:36:06,864 --> 00:36:10,664
I'm not ashamed now, nor angry.

475
00:36:10,768 --> 00:36:13,703
Pardon me, sir, but if you should have
an engagement elsewhere...

476
00:36:13,805 --> 00:36:16,000
I think now is the time to go to it.

477
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:19,372
Yes, I... - I do have other business.
Good morning.

478
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:22,275
Oh, do not harden your heart, young man.

479
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:29,410
Come try for yourself whether our way
is not better than yours.

480
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,114
I will now strike you on one cheek...

481
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:36,853
and you will turn the other
and learn how much better you'll feel...

482
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:39,691
by not giving way to the promptings of anger.

483
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:41,264
Somebody protect me.

484
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:43,527
I've been doing my best, sir,
but you've asked for it.

485
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:45,602
- You had two whacks at him.
- [Centurion Laughing]

486
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:48,297
Come, friend. Courage.

487
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:51,398
I may hurt your body for a moment...

488
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:55,809
but your soul will rejoice
in the victory of the... -

489
00:36:55,913 --> 00:36:57,813
the spirit over the flesh.

490
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:04,150
Easy, Ferrovius, easy.
You broke the last man's jaw.

491
00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:07,156
Yes, but I saved his soul.

492
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:09,351
What matters a broken jaw?

493
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:12,657
- Quickly, sir, run for it.
- Confound it. I'm trying to.

494
00:37:12,764 --> 00:37:14,561
Don't touch me. Do you hear? The law.

495
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:16,826
Ah, the law.

496
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:19,903
The law will throw me
to the lions tomorrow.

497
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:23,167
What worse could it do
if I were to slay you?

498
00:37:23,274 --> 00:37:27,608
Pray for strength,
and it shall be given unto you.

499
00:37:27,712 --> 00:37:29,646
Let-Let... - Let him no, brother.

500
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:33,114
- Our religion forbids you to strike him.
- On the contrary.

501
00:37:33,217 --> 00:37:35,742
It commands me to strike him.

502
00:37:35,853 --> 00:37:38,481
How can he turn the other cheek...

503
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,784
if he is not first struck on one cheek?

504
00:37:40,892 --> 00:37:43,759
But I'm sure he's convinced
that what you said is quite right.

505
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:45,954
- You are, aren't you, sir?
- Oh, I am. I am. Absolutely.

506
00:37:46,064 --> 00:37:48,157
I... - I apologize for striking you.

507
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:51,963
- You see, brother? You have convinced him.
- Oh, my son.

508
00:37:53,137 --> 00:37:55,105
Have I... -

509
00:37:56,174 --> 00:37:59,337
Have I softened your heart?

510
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:02,845
Are your feet turning
towards a better path?

511
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:05,939
Yes. There's a great deal in what you say.

512
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,245
Then join us.

513
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:11,321
Come to the lions.
Come to suffering.

514
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:15,319
- And death.
- Oh! Help me, brother.

515
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:18,486
[Crowd Laughing]

516
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:22,225
God has greatly blessed
my powers of conversion.

517
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,370
Shall I tell you a miracle...

518
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:30,532
wrought by me in Cappadocia?

519
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:34,805
A young man... - just such a one as you...

520
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:37,813
with golden hair like yours... -

521
00:38:37,915 --> 00:38:40,782
scoffed at and struck me.

522
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:43,479
I sat up all night with that youth...

523
00:38:43,588 --> 00:38:46,216
wrestling for his soul.

524
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:50,158
And in the morning,
not only was he a Christian...

525
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:55,289
but his hair was as white as snow.

526
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:57,833
[Whimpers]

527
00:38:57,935 --> 00:39:01,496
[Crowd Laughing]

528
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,840
May his friend take him away now, brother?

529
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:06,967
Yes, yes. Take him away.

530
00:39:10,248 --> 00:39:15,242
The, uh... - The spirit has overwrought him.
Poor lad.

531
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:17,719
Carry him gently to his house...

532
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:20,052
and leave the rest to heaven.

533
00:39:20,158 --> 00:39:22,285
You are his friend, young man.

534
00:39:22,393 --> 00:39:24,486
You will see that he is taken safely home.

535
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:26,893
Certainly, sir.
I'll do whatever you think best.

536
00:39:26,998 --> 00:39:29,296
I'm most happy to have made
your acquaintance, I'm sure.

537
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,960
You may depend on me.
Good morning, sir.

538
00:39:34,272 --> 00:39:38,606
And the blessings of heaven
be upon you and him.

539
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:41,177
[Crowd Laughing]

540
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:50,715
- Mmm.
- So that is how you convert people, Ferrovius.

541
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:55,024
Yes, child.

542
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:57,959
There's been a great blessing
on my work...

543
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:02,522
in spite of my unworthiness
and backslidings... -

544
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:05,227
all through my wicked and devilish temper.

545
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:07,804
[Crowd Laughing]

546
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:45,000
Caesar, I hate to disturb you in your bath...

547
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:47,907
but there are several things
which must be attended to at once.

548
00:40:48,012 --> 00:40:49,912
You leave everything to the last minute.

549
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:54,417
Be calm, Editor. You wear yourself out
with needless aggravation.

550
00:40:54,518 --> 00:40:57,316
Take the baths with me.
You'll feel better.

551
00:40:57,421 --> 00:40:59,651
As manager of the Colosseum
and producer of the games...

552
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:01,622
I haven't the time, and you know it.

553
00:41:01,726 --> 00:41:03,694
You want the spectacle
to be a success, don't you?

554
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:06,558
Oh, I leave that to you,
but I warn you it had better be.

555
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:08,359
I'm counting on it.

556
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:11,128
Then you had better listen
to the program.

557
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:13,931
We open as usual with the sham battle... -

558
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:16,802
wooden swords and shields
until the spectators are seated.

559
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:20,343
Then you arrive,
and the grand procession follows.

560
00:41:20,444 --> 00:41:22,708
Then combats.

561
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:25,304
And after that, the Christians.

562
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:27,646
Personally, I could do without the Christians.

563
00:41:27,752 --> 00:41:29,583
We're trying to do without them.

564
00:41:29,687 --> 00:41:31,882
That is why we serve them to the lions.

565
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,854
- They vulgarize the whole affair.
- [Snaps Fingers]

566
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:36,119
There's no art in watching
a hungry lion being fed.

567
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:39,219
I, for one, regret the day
they were introduced into the games.

568
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:43,289
Oh, you're too civilized, Editor.
You've lost the common touch.

569
00:41:43,401 --> 00:41:46,700
It is to see the Christians
that the people flock to the arena.

570
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:48,704
At the rate we're getting rid of them...

571
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:51,570
- soon there will be no Christians to feed the lions.
- [Scoffs]

572
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:55,339
Caesar will no down in history
as the emperor who eliminated these cranks.

573
00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:57,175
- Hail Caesar.
- On the contrary.

574
00:41:57,281 --> 00:42:00,808
I'm more likely to be remembered as the man
who did most to perpetuate them.

575
00:42:00,918 --> 00:42:02,044
You, Caesar?

576
00:42:02,153 --> 00:42:05,122
I dare say I am doing more
to spread Christianity...

577
00:42:05,222 --> 00:42:09,181
than all their preachers, missionaries
and gospel writers put together.

578
00:42:09,293 --> 00:42:13,127
I shouldn't be surprised if finally I wound up
as one of their heroes.

579
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:15,960
- Caesar jests of course.
- Caesar does not jest.

580
00:42:16,067 --> 00:42:20,470
I wager that for every Christian
that dies in the bloody sand...

581
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:23,540
two new ones leave the Colosseum.

582
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:26,576
Perhaps then Caesar should change his tactics.

583
00:42:26,677 --> 00:42:29,703
Impossible. I am a subject of history...

584
00:42:29,814 --> 00:42:32,908
and I must submit to its inevitable course.

585
00:42:33,984 --> 00:42:37,886
It is my destiny
to fan the fires of Christianity...

586
00:42:37,988 --> 00:42:40,650
by offering them martyrdom in the arena.

587
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:47,525
Column, halt!

588
00:42:47,631 --> 00:42:48,757
[Soldier]
Halt!

589
00:42:51,369 --> 00:42:53,963
Now then, you Christians...

590
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:56,904
none of your larks, no singing.

591
00:42:57,007 --> 00:42:58,702
Look respectable.

592
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:02,404
Look serious, if you're capable of it.

593
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:05,272
See that big building over there?

594
00:43:05,383 --> 00:43:07,874
That's the Colosseum, that is.

595
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:12,251
That's where you're to be thrown to the lions
or set to fight the gladiators presently.

596
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:15,484
Think of that, and it'll help you
to behave properly.

597
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,493
The Colosseum.

598
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:20,554
Think of it.

599
00:43:20,664 --> 00:43:22,689
I never thought I'd live to see it.

600
00:43:25,002 --> 00:43:27,061
This trip has been very educational,
hasn't it?

601
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:29,503
You're a born tourist, Androcles.

602
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:32,167
I always wanted to travel.

603
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:34,972
Too bad we won't have any time
to ourselves.

604
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:37,775
There's so many places in Rome
I'd like to visit.

605
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:40,574
It's a beautiful city, isn't it?

606
00:43:40,684 --> 00:43:43,152
It's nothing compared to where we are going.

607
00:43:43,254 --> 00:43:47,088
The streets will be paved with gold
and precious jewels...

608
00:43:47,191 --> 00:43:49,989
and the buildings all white marble... -

609
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:52,790
a dazzling sight to the naked eye.

610
00:43:52,897 --> 00:43:55,661
You're a bit of a tourist too, Ferrovius.

611
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:57,631
<i>[Centurion]</i>
<i>All right, forward!</i>

612
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:02,500
You there. You soldiers
clear out of the way for the emperor.

613
00:44:02,606 --> 00:44:04,631
The emperor? Where's the emperor?

614
00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:07,711
- You're not the emperor, are you?
- It's the menagerie service.

615
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:10,713
My team of oxen is drawing the new lion
to the Colosseum.

616
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:13,716
- Now you clear the road.
- What? Go in after you and your dust...

617
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:15,945
with half the town at the heels
of you and your lion?

618
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:18,749
Not likely. We no first.

619
00:44:18,856 --> 00:44:20,483
Ten-shun!

620
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:24,493
Now you look here! The menagerie service
is the emperor's personal retinue...

621
00:44:24,595 --> 00:44:26,495
and you clear out, I tell you!

622

You tell me, do you?
Well, I'll tell you something.

623
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:32,193
If the lion is the menagerie service,
the lion's dinner is menagerie service too.

624
00:44:32,303 --> 00:44:34,703
And this is the lion's dinner!

625
00:44:34,805 --> 00:44:37,774
Now back up your bullocks double quick.
Learn your place!

626
00:44:37,875 --> 00:44:40,605
Now then, you Christians, step out there.

Come along, the rest of the dinner.

628

- I shall be the soup.
- I shall be the roast boar.

Is that the way for martyrs to behave?

[Laughing Continues]

636
00:45:07,872 --> 00:45:09,772
In the Emperor Domitian's reign...

637
00:45:09,874 --> 00:45:15,005
a Gaul slew three men in the arena single-handed
and gained his freedom.

638
00:45:15,112 --> 00:45:18,548
- Could this Ferrovius surpass him?
- Not in my opinion.

639
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:21,914
You think his opinion is wrong, Captain?

640
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:23,987
I think his opinion is prejudiced, Caesar.

641
00:45:24,088 --> 00:45:26,249
And the female prisoner... -

642
00:45:26,357 --> 00:45:30,453
was she any more successful
in her attempts to convert you, Captain?

643
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:33,359
No more successful, but less obvious, Caesar.

644
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:40,230
I commend your devotion to duty, Captain.

645
00:45:40,337 --> 00:45:43,773
Your devotion is only to your duty,
I hope, Captain.

- Only to my duty, Caesar.
- Then she was not pretty?

She was very pretty, Caesar.

Spintho. You're late.
We've missed you.

651
00:45:58,956 --> 00:46:00,651
I have been at the temple all morning.

652
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:03,852
Do the gods treat you so poorly
that they wear you out?

653
00:46:03,961 --> 00:46:07,419
- You look a bit seedy.
- I have not been well.

654
00:46:07,531 --> 00:46:11,194
You go to the temple too often.
Piety can be overdone.

655
00:46:11,302 --> 00:46:14,032
Too much religion is not good for the liver.

656
00:46:16,807 --> 00:46:20,607
One might think
you had a bad conscience, Spintho.

657
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:23,475
My conscience is as clear
as the next man's.

658
00:46:23,581 --> 00:46:25,947
A small boast, Spintho.

Cato, the editor fears that we shall use up
all the available Christians...

661

but idle time on our hands.

I shall always know
where to turn up one or two.

663
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,659
Caesar assures me
we shall never be without them.

664
00:46:44,768 --> 00:46:48,033
I was explaining to the editor
that they are noble rascals...

665
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:52,472
who will eventually gobble us up... -
as the lions now gobble them up.

666
00:46:52,576 --> 00:46:55,272
They are not all noble, Caesar.

667
00:46:55,379 --> 00:46:58,906
- Some of them are quite two-faced.
- Indeed?

668
00:46:59,016 --> 00:47:02,281
I thought they were too dedicated
for double-dealing.

669
00:47:02,386 --> 00:47:05,184
There are those with a foot in both camps...

670
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:09,885
blowing with each golden wind
whither their profit takes them.

671
00:47:09,994 --> 00:47:12,963
Romans one day, Christians the next.

672
00:47:13,063 --> 00:47:15,964
Thus they may rob the temple today
in the name of Christianity...

673
00:47:16,066 --> 00:47:19,695
and steal from the Christians tomorrow
in the name of Rome.

<i>[Caesar]</i>
<i>How opportune for them.</i>

Are there really such scoundrels, Cato?

676
00:47:25,976 --> 00:47:27,876
Nearer than you think, Caesar.

677
00:47:27,978 --> 00:47:30,208
Really? At the court?

678
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:33,374
What fun.
I shouldn't have believed it.

679
00:47:33,484 --> 00:47:37,750
Cato insults us all by these accusations.
I, for one, resent them.

680
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:40,153
I made no accusations, Spintho.

681
00:47:40,257 --> 00:47:44,353
Think of it. A Christian at the court... -
and a dishonest one.

682
00:47:44,461 --> 00:47:47,123
Not anyone present, Cato?

683
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:51,167
Not Metellus? Nor Lentulus?

684
00:47:51,268 --> 00:47:53,236
Caesar.

685
00:47:53,337 --> 00:47:56,238
Not the editor?

686
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:57,864
Nor the captain?

Oh, no, no. Not in a million years.

689
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:09,943
If Caesar will excuse me,
I have not been feeling well.

690
00:48:10,054 --> 00:48:12,648
I remarked that you looked pale

- It will not be necessary.
- I insist.

00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:28,061
If Caesar wishes.

Well, that doesn't matter.

Sacrifice to Jupiter.
He likes animals.

For that very reason,
perhaps, it might be as well to have him.

I shall, perhaps, not refuse it.
