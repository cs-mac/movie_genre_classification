1
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:26,869
We had great fun in Paris.
30 years I've waited for it.

2
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:31,392
And now - moving to the country!
- Come on! For 24 hours only!

3
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:34,869
But I can't drive you to Odeon
every day!

4
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:38,869
- Especially not with your arthritis!
- Where is my suitcase!

5
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:42,471
Downstairs, in the car

6
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:46,869
- As usual, dad?
- As usual, my boy!

7
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:48,950
- Ready!
- Yahooo! Youpie!

8
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:55,031
- Youpie!
- Careful! Attention! And hop!

9
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,071
Uff

10
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:01,276
And hop!

11
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:10,918
You promised to bring me back,
'cause in 24 hours they'll drive me nuts!

12
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,919
- I have had it with these Buteaux.
- Oh! But not with the little Buteaux.

13
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,873
- They are sweet, the little Buteaux.
- I have had it with them too.

14
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,032
Oh boy, did you become grumpy!

15
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:26,032
- Hold still, don't move
- Like you had to ask!

16
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,314
And.. voila!

17
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:40,315
Damn seat! Always gets out of order!

18
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,757
Ready to go!

19
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,072
You have eaten well, huh?

20
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,552
Careful with the little legs.

21
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:27,918
Jean-Philippe Duroc of Advocacy of Paris.
I'm here to see my client Martial Gaulard.

22
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,951
- Right, here you are.
- Thank you.

23
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:41,553
- He's not in the same cell anymore?
- No, he's in the section for condamned to death.

24
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:46,951
Here it's the same as in Lyon...
You hear this?

25
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:52,396
- Our world in falling apart right before us.
- As for yours, we could get by without it.

26
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:02,951
- Here.
- How's Gaulard doing?

27
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:06,357
- He's fine.
- Is he nervous?

28
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,357
Would you be nervous in his place?

29
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,471
- Does he mention me sometimes?
- No.

30
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,350
Well, sometimes he says
stuff in his sleep.

31
00:06:18,159 --> 00:06:21,151
Ah. And what exactly?
- Huh?

32
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:25,392
- What exactly does he say?
- "Bastard, imbecile lawyer!".

33
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:28,869
- Oh, my...!
- And sometimes he rattles his cell.

34
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:33,392
Here. Shall I open it for you?
- No, I, I, I'd like to talk to him...

35
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:36,357
through the window.
- All right.

36
00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:40,069
Martial Gaulard, I have some
bad news for you.

37
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:44,869
Your appeal for reconsideration
was rejected. But, but!

38
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:50,151
Ha! But we've still got petition
for pardon!

39
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:54,869
Petition to president!
Where did I put it...

40
00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:59,438
And do you know whom I'm meeting
tomorrow about your case?

41
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:02,073
General de Gaulle!

42
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:08,231
Oh! Sir! Sir!
You gangster, bastard!

43
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:13,438
- This will cost you a lot!
- How much more can it cost me, huh?

44
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:16,869
I am sentenced to death,
they won't cut my head off twice!

45
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:36,471
Hello! Yes, right away.

46
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,313
Come, come quickly! Get up!
Hurry up! Let's go!

47
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:10,111
Hey! Don't leave me here! Open up!

48
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,071
Thanks, Loulou.

49
00:09:50,479 --> 00:09:53,437
Where are the keys?
- Inside, Dupuy's got them.

50
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,948
Get other keys and grenades
and gas masks!

51
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,272
Help! This man is hurt!

52
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,038
Not assisting...
in helping is prosecuted!

53
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:21,393
Don't shoot! You only make
your case worse!

54
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,438
- What are you waiting for?

55
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,313
Are you ever going to open this door?

56
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,473
- Excuse me...
- Good-bye!

57
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:53,715
Don't leave! I'll protect you!
They don't have a right to shoot!

58
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,470
But it's my car, isn't it?
Stop! Stop right now, Gaulard.

59
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,473
You are making your case really bad!

60
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,678
Gaulard, I'm begging you!

61
00:13:14,479 --> 00:13:17,073
Oh goddammit!

62
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:26,431
You are innocent, Gaulard! I know it!
Don't behave now like you are guilty!

63
00:13:26,479 --> 00:13:30,757
I am your lawyer! I will protect you
even against your will! Come back to prison!

64
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,793
I will explain everything on your behalf,
second turn to the left! Don't miss it!

65
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,074
Oh, oh no!

66
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,152
I said stop! I said stop!
Holy mother of God! Careful!

67
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,873
Beat it right now! Get off!
I was sentenced 'cause of you!

68
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,798
I have had it up to here with you!

69
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,350
Turn the volume up!
- ...security guard hurt by Jean-Philippe Duroc.

70
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,350
It is confirmed that Mr. Duroc
who is known for his leftist ideas...

71
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,919
Ah, you are a leftist on the top of it!
...instigated the mutiny...

72
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,919
that started in the prison this evening.
- But they are crazy! It's not true!

73
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:19,919
...says Rudy le Rouge. Duroc, after having
seriously injured guard Dupuy,

74
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:23,919
succeeded in making his client escape...
- Stop, I have to explain them everything!

75
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,474
Because you believe they will believe you?

76
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,394
Holy Christ, look!

77
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,513
Excuse me, Miss, for appearing in this outfit.

78
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,358
- How much is it?
- 100 francs.

79
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,438
- 100 francs.
- 100 francs, it's way too much!

80
00:14:50,479 --> 00:14:53,437
- What's your problem now?
- What's my problem? it's my money!

81
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,439
Zip it and get in the car. It's been a year
since my last time! Start the car!

82
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,439
- Let's go to a hotel, it's more comfortable.
- I am sorry, haven't got much time!

83
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,472
Get on the rear seat!

84
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,439
It's my car, just so you know!
It's not a Lonely Hearts club!

85
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,473
- No, not in my car!
- Go, start it, drive!

86
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,552
It's them, go quickly!

87
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,473
Here Rocheteau. Suspects located.
Following them. Roger.

88
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:46,193
- The cops! Speed up, for God's sake!
- I can't! I'm at full throttle!

89
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:16,110
- That's it! They will catch us now!
- Oh no, they won't

90
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,197
Say, aren't those boobs lovely?

91
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,473
- Idiot, imbecile, dumbass!
- You want a piece of me now?

92
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,358
But it's can't be.

93
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,914
But it can't be.

94
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:26,792
Excuse me, Miss.

95
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,829
What on earth is this?

96
00:17:54,959 --> 00:17:58,349
There was a little accident close to Lyon.
I've lost them!

97
00:17:58,959 --> 00:18:02,918
It happens, huh? I will need barricades
in 50 km periphery!

98
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,919
I don't care about the protesters!
We can not let the whole country fall to pieces

99
00:18:06,959 --> 00:18:08,950
simply because the students have gone crazy!

100
00:18:08,999 --> 00:18:12,548
- What do we do with this?
- Get her out of here, for crying out loud!

101
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:15,837
Enough with this, basta, go, go!

102
00:18:17,959 --> 00:18:20,837
- Go!
- Trying, but...

103
00:18:20,959 --> 00:18:23,553
Go!

104
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:27,869
- Fine, I'm outta here!
- I am not going to leave my car!

105
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:34,477
Hold on, wait for me!

106
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:38,551
I am not going to leave my car!

107
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:05,429
- Should have thrown you out!
- Come on, do it now.

108
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:09,998
- You won't make it far on the stolen truck.
- I'm going straight to Paris!

109
00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:13,998
- And stop bugging me about your old man.
- My father is sick, he is 76 years old.

110
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:17,998
I can see him right now, tiny person,
with twisted gray hair!

111
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:21,998
Yeah, yeah, real son of a bitch,
like all the bourgeois!

112
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:25,998
My father worked hard all his life to make
me what I am today!

113
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:29,998
Here we are, the guy started with nothing much
only to achieve nothing special!

114
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:33,031
Small wonder you are a leftist!

115
00:19:33,479 --> 00:19:37,995
Shut it, Gaulard, you don't know the first thing
about my life! But I know all about your!

116
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:41,998
I studied all your records of petty excuses
and false pretenses!

117
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:46,430
Tearjerking drama! Born in Indochina, then..

118
00:19:46,479 --> 00:19:49,869
Algeria, Haschish, H.L.M.,
it's so annoying... soldier... sweat.

119
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,837
First of all, take off your clothes!
They bring back bad memories.

120
00:19:55,879 --> 00:19:58,473
No, I'm cold. Stop the car, I need to
go and call my father!

121
00:19:59,479 --> 00:20:03,438
I was getting frozen all night in that hangar.
Give me back my pants!

122
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,870
Get them off, I'm telling you!
It's no good parading like this.

123
00:20:07,479 --> 00:20:10,437
You are disgusting, Gaulard,

124
00:20:10,479 --> 00:20:13,869
Like... like all the co.. cons.

125
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:17,710
Why stutter now? You are not in the court!

126
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,679
- Where are you going?
- To phone.

127
00:20:54,719 --> 00:20:57,995
- Ah, right, your Chinese girl.
- She's half-Vietnamese.

128
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:06,669
- Ok, what is the number of your dad?
- 28-30 in Auxerre.

129
00:21:09,479 --> 00:21:12,471
Could you bring me a cup of coffee too?

130
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,914
- Hello, everybody.
- Hello.

131
00:21:18,959 --> 00:21:21,837
- Can I call from you?
- To Mecon?

132
00:21:21,959 --> 00:21:25,349
- No, to Paris and then to Auxerre.
- Patron, fill me up!

133
00:21:26,479 --> 00:21:29,437
And two coffees to go.

134
00:21:29,479 --> 00:21:32,869
Hello, I'd like to speak to Medicis 41-17
in Paris, please.

135
00:21:37,959 --> 00:21:39,756
Telephone.

136
00:21:43,479 --> 00:21:45,071
Hello?

137
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:49,671
- Do not hang up. Bach-Yen!
- Yes, mother.

138
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:53,033
- Phone for you.
- Who is it?

139
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:55,957
- I don't know.
- Hello?

140
00:21:56,479 --> 00:21:59,869
- Is it you, Blanche-Hirondelle?
- Martial, but where are you?

141
00:22:00,879 --> 00:22:03,473
I escaped!

142
00:22:16,879 --> 00:22:18,312
Incredible, huh!

143
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:21,557
What the hell is taking him so long?

144
00:22:38,479 --> 00:22:41,073
Dammit!

145
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:48,071
- Officer!
- Yes? What is it?

146
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:52,112
- Same truck as was stolen from Caluire.
- The number is dirty,

147
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,152
can't see anything
Let's go and take a look.

148
00:22:58,959 --> 00:23:02,349
- I love you and I want you.
- Me too, I want you.

149
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:05,751
I want to see you.

150
00:23:12,479 --> 00:23:15,073
Martial! Pst!

151
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:18,995
- What time will you come?
- If all goes well, I'll be there by evening.

152
00:23:20,479 --> 00:23:22,470
Let's try this.

153
00:23:33,239 --> 00:23:35,079
This is it, the same number!

154
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:16,151
Hey! Jean-Philippe, wait for me,
I'm over here!

155
00:25:01,439 --> 00:25:04,033
What the hell are you doing?

156
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:25,836
Hey, open it!

157
00:25:29,479 --> 00:25:31,276
Stop.

158
00:25:32,479 --> 00:25:33,958
Stop!

159
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:51,709
Martial! Martial! It cannot be...
Martial, Martial...

160
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,870
Help! Help! Over here!
Martial, help...

161
00:25:56,479 --> 00:25:59,073
Ah! What is it...

162
00:26:00,479 --> 00:26:03,437
- Don't ever try this again.
- But what on earth did I do?

163
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,870
- I don't give a shit bout you, but truck...
- Hey, a helicopter!

164
00:26:08,479 --> 00:26:11,755
Shit, a helicopter,
ah, a helicopter, come!

165
00:26:12,479 --> 00:26:14,470
- A what?
- There, there!

166
00:26:23,199 --> 00:26:26,191
Hop on and close the door!

167
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:29,750
Climb, climb!

168
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:54,752
After, after them, for God's sake,
we will loose them!

169
00:27:13,959 --> 00:27:17,235
- They are falling behind.
- Come, let's hide there.

170
00:27:20,959 --> 00:27:23,837
- Don't adjust behind me.
- Oh!

171
00:27:57,479 --> 00:28:00,357
- Shh! The chain.
- Huh?

172
00:28:07,399 --> 00:28:10,391
The chain, get on, get on!

173
00:28:11,999 --> 00:28:15,389
- Here, catch!
- Careful, it's your pardon!

174
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:21,514
Shit, my pardon could swim away from me.
Come on, in the name of God!

175
00:28:24,999 --> 00:28:27,991
You've got the pardon?
Pass it over.

176
00:28:30,679 --> 00:28:33,557
Didn't get too wet.

177
00:29:00,879 --> 00:29:03,951
- This is it, the pardon of president?
- Yes.

178
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:11,191
If he signs here, you - oh!!
But if he signs here...

179
00:29:13,479 --> 00:29:16,073
Show it to me!

180
00:29:17,479 --> 00:29:21,438
"Decree: The President of the Republic,
in accordance with the constitution...

181
00:29:21,479 --> 00:29:24,357
as of October 4th, 1958 declared:

182
00:29:26,879 --> 00:29:31,430
the death penalty is commuted to
life imprisonment.

183
00:29:31,479 --> 00:29:35,392
The President of the Republic,
bla, bla, bla, bla... decided...

184
00:29:35,479 --> 00:29:39,392
to let justice take its course.
To kill or not to kill.

185
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:43,873
- Strike the unnecessary!
- Anyway, I am against the death penalty!

186
00:29:44,479 --> 00:29:47,437
- Yeah, and I am for it.
- But you're crazy!

187
00:29:47,479 --> 00:29:50,755
- Have you already seen such an execution?
- No.

188
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,838
But it's monstrous!

189
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:57,918
By early-morning light they wake the poor
guy up to shave his neck...

190
00:29:57,959 --> 00:30:01,918
a glass of rum, cigarettes...
- Right, cut it. You are too descriptive.

191
00:30:01,959 --> 00:30:04,951
Oh! I'm sorry, Gaulard. Excuse me.

192
00:30:05,959 --> 00:30:09,872
I'll tell you one thing!
The guy who shot the accountant...

193
00:30:10,959 --> 00:30:14,349
- It really wasn't you?
- I swear! But this son of a bitch

194
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,873
who let an innocent person to be sentenced
in his place, if I ever get him,

195
00:30:18,959 --> 00:30:22,872
I'll skin him alive, take my word for it!
- Of course, law of your environment...

196
00:30:22,959 --> 00:30:26,918
eye for an eye, the vendetta!
- The only way to calm people down.

197
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,919
Look at those little cons on
their barricades today

198
00:30:30,959 --> 00:30:34,349
I would simply send the tanks,
and you'd see that in no time...

199
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:38,918
You know who you are, Gaulard?
A poor fascist who missed his calling.

200
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,236
- Oh, and what is it, my calling?
- To be a cop!

201
00:30:42,959 --> 00:30:45,951
The helicopter! Jump! Quickly! Hide!

202
00:30:50,199 --> 00:30:53,271
But where's the helicopter?
The helicopter?

203
00:30:53,479 --> 00:30:57,438
What helicopter? Oh, I thought I saw one.
Remember this - all the cops are full of shit!

204
00:30:57,479 --> 00:31:01,916
Better help me, instead of your
stupid jokes!

205
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:07,797
Gotta find you some clothes.

206
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:11,712
You can't parade like this anymore.
You look like a drag queen

207
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:14,791
in mourning! And you're not even embarrassed.

208
00:31:19,879 --> 00:31:24,111
Surely you don't think that I will ever put
this on? It's disgusting,

209
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:27,435
we don't even know who wore it before.
- Come on, come on, big mouth!

210
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,511
Voilà! Quite different already.

211
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:40,712
It's funny, you remind me of someone,
but I can't remember who.

212
00:32:00,959 --> 00:32:04,918
Are you hungry? We could buy something
from the farm over there...

213
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:09,238
Why do you always want to buy things,
when all you have to do is snatch?

214
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:11,235
Come, follow me.

215
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,793
Snatch and snatch all the time!

216
00:32:35,879 --> 00:32:38,871
Hey, Jeannot, you're crazy! Stop it!

217
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:44,749
I've been watching you for 10 minutes,
I can't hold it anymore!

218
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:48,351
Stop it, Gustave will be back
any minute now!

219
00:33:01,199 --> 00:33:02,996
No. No!

220
00:33:07,879 --> 00:33:09,471
Yes.

221
00:34:04,879 --> 00:34:07,871
- What are you doing?
- Non of your business...

222
00:34:19,879 --> 00:34:22,473
Anybody there? Hey!

223
00:34:46,359 --> 00:34:49,317
- Come on, undress...
- But we aren't going to steal!

224
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:53,318
You're not stealing, I am.  I'm
returning your suit and taking this one.

225
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:57,796
Give me my purse, I will leave some money
on the table.

226
00:35:04,879 --> 00:35:07,473
Hide, quick!

227
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:11,993
Là, là, là!

228
00:36:24,879 --> 00:36:27,951
...helped to escape his client,
Martial Gaulard,

229
00:36:28,879 --> 00:36:32,269
a dangerous criminal who was
sentenced to capital punishment.

230
00:36:34,879 --> 00:36:38,155
Marguerite, say, I can't find my moto!

231
00:36:38,999 --> 00:36:42,389
- Where did you leave it?
- Over there. Someone stole it!

232
00:36:44,879 --> 00:36:47,951
It's Gustave.
Go quickly! Hide!

233
00:37:10,359 --> 00:37:12,953
- Cuckold!
- Me?

234
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:17,831
No, I am a cuckold. You are cheating on me!
Everyone in the village says

235
00:37:17,879 --> 00:37:21,269
that you are sleeping with Jeannot!
- Who says it? Your mother,

236
00:37:21,879 --> 00:37:26,077
your sisters, your girlfriends? Let me go!
- What are you doing in this bathrobe?

237
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:30,317
I was cooking you dinner, after having
milked your cows and cleaned your house...

238
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:33,635
He's there, I'm sure of it!
I can feel it, I know it!

239
00:37:34,879 --> 00:37:37,313
- Who?
- Jeannot!

240
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:41,272
- If I catch him, I'll strangle him!
- Of course! He's in the wardrobe!

241
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:45,749
I hid him when I heard you were coming.
Come on, open it!

242
00:37:46,879 --> 00:37:50,269
- No, it's ok.
- What are you waiting for? open!

243
00:37:50,879 --> 00:37:53,473
Hello, Madame.

244
00:37:55,959 --> 00:37:57,836
Bastard! Bitch!

245
00:37:57,879 --> 00:38:01,269
- Can't you see it's not Jeannot!
- Who is this idiot?

246
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:05,792
I don't know hime, I swear!
Do you believe I could cheat on you with...

247
00:38:05,879 --> 00:38:08,951
a guy like this?
- Pst! Pst! It's true.

248
00:38:09,879 --> 00:38:13,269
I swear! I am Master Duroc,
lawyer of the Advocacy of Paris,

249
00:38:13,879 --> 00:38:16,757
- here's my dress!
- My gun!

250
00:38:16,879 --> 00:38:20,872
I'll convince you, you are talking to a
lawyer! Reconsideration of the facts...

251
00:38:16,879 --> 00:38:20,872
I'm telling you, you're talking to a lawyer!
Let's recap the facts...

252
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:34,308
You shouldn't get so upset! Just don't
come home without warning next time!

253
00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:37,351
- Bitch!
- I don't know him!

254
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:53,192
No!

255
00:39:00,879 --> 00:39:03,871
- Jeannot...
- No, Gustave! I love you!

256
00:39:04,359 --> 00:39:08,910
I don't know any of those men!
Nor Jeannot! I don't know him either!

257
00:39:08,959 --> 00:39:10,950
Catch!

258
00:39:11,919 --> 00:39:14,513
Bastard! Scum!

259
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:22,631
Stop it, you're completely crazy!

260
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:24,874
Get out of here!

261
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:30,990
No, stop it!

262
00:40:25,879 --> 00:40:29,269
- Hey you, wake up!
- What's going on?

263
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:33,319
- Look here, we're out of gas!
- We should find a gas station!

264
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:37,318
They are all closed, we've already passed
many. And we don't have money!

265
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:41,830
- How so? And where is my purse?
- You left in your pants on the farm.

266
00:40:41,879 --> 00:40:45,269
If only we could find a working station,

267
00:40:46,359 --> 00:40:48,827
I could always shake the owner a bit.

268
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:51,837
- Listen to me, Gaulard!
- Yes, Maitre.

269
00:40:51,879 --> 00:40:55,838
You're a bad thief, a very clumsy one!
Shake the owner...

270
00:40:55,879 --> 00:40:59,838
- You don't even know what you're doing.
- Enough crying over your purse!

271
00:40:59,879 --> 00:41:03,269
- You wanted to pay the cuckold anyway!
- I want to get out

272
00:41:03,879 --> 00:41:08,509
- I can't stand this anymore!
- You will get out, hold on a bit!

273
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:11,551
- But what are we going to do?
- This.

274
00:41:16,879 --> 00:41:18,676
...

275
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:23,751
- Perfect!
- I swear to God he is crazy..

276
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:27,477
Come here

277
00:41:32,359 --> 00:41:35,351
I think I have a plan

278
00:41:35,879 --> 00:41:39,110
You have, you really have an idea?
Hold it.

279
00:41:39,159 --> 00:41:40,956
Voilà! There!

280
00:41:47,879 --> 00:41:50,871
Hey, are you taking me for a clown?
- No.

281
00:41:51,879 --> 00:41:54,473
Hold you shirt.

282
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:58,269
- Now the panties.
- Oh, no, no, not my pants!

283
00:41:58,879 --> 00:42:02,155
- Good, are you good at acting?
- I am a lawyer!

284
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:06,838
Ah, right, I've heard something bout it.
chose. Mind if I clean my hands?

285
00:42:06,879 --> 00:42:10,155
Move over, you're so dirty!

286
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:19,557
Voilà. You will lie down there.

287
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:22,671
- May I ask why?
- Lie down... do as I say!

288
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:27,796
There, head like this. Mouth open,
it's more spectacular.

289
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:30,347
Make a grimace.

290
00:42:31,879 --> 00:42:34,837
- Can you be more tragic?
- Hold on... Ah!

291
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:38,792
Good, that will do. I'll explain now!
Somebody will stop when they see you.

292
00:42:38,879 --> 00:42:42,838
He will get out of his car.
He will come up to you. You don't move.

293
00:42:42,879 --> 00:42:46,155
- You fake being dead.
- Maybe I should hold my breath too?

294
00:42:46,359 --> 00:42:49,749
Right. He will lower himself to you
to check if your heart still beats.

295
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:54,318
And here I come from behind and...
- You tap him on the shoulder...

296
00:42:54,359 --> 00:42:58,272
asking to give us a ride.
- Voilà! You got it!

297
00:42:59,879 --> 00:43:03,838
- Swear you won't do him any harm!
- Me? I couldn't harm a living thing!

298
00:43:03,879 --> 00:43:08,316
- That's what frightens me!
- Quit talking now.

299
00:43:13,879 --> 00:43:16,837
- Ok, you don't move, you got it?
- Yes...

300
00:43:16,879 --> 00:43:19,871
I'll be over there!

301
00:43:34,359 --> 00:43:36,953
There's a car!

302
00:43:44,999 --> 00:43:48,912
Not helping a person in danger!
Article 63 of the Criminal Code

303
00:43:48,999 --> 00:43:52,912
Bastards, egoists! No, there're
no more good people in this country!

304
00:43:52,999 --> 00:43:56,389
They'll let you die like a dog on
the side of the road!

305
00:43:56,999 --> 00:44:01,311
- Did you get his number, Gaulard?
- Here's another one! Quick, lay down!

306
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:04,749
Lay down, the grimace, the head, voilà!

307
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:08,432
- Hey, and what's that?
- Not your business.

308
00:44:24,879 --> 00:44:28,269
- Tell me, Gaulard, what if I lie down
right across the road?

309
00:44:28,879 --> 00:44:33,714
You're insane. They will run you over!
Hey, this one will stop for sure!

310
00:44:47,879 --> 00:44:50,871
Stretcher, quickly!
Go, go!

311
00:44:51,879 --> 00:44:54,871
It's serious, be careful with him!

312
00:44:59,879 --> 00:45:02,757
He's got a terrible look.

313
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:09,797
Yes, go gently. Good.
Go, go, be on the way!

314
00:46:11,879 --> 00:46:15,838
I am scared to death! Let's return to Paris,
Jacques, I have a bad feeling.

315
00:46:15,879 --> 00:46:19,838
Calm down, Gisèle, Sansonnet passed
yesterday without a problem.

316
00:46:19,879 --> 00:46:23,838
- They called me from Geneva this morning.
- They weren't risking too much:

317
00:46:23,879 --> 00:46:27,838
2 fake Rembrandts and one green Picasso.
Caviar, you didn't take the caviar?

318
00:46:27,879 --> 00:46:31,792
I took the lobster and foie gras.
- I hate foie gras.

319
00:46:31,879 --> 00:46:35,838
And the crustaceans give me urticaria.
Always the same selfishness!

320
00:46:35,879 --> 00:46:39,838
Come on, war is war, it's revolution
out there, do not forget!

321
00:46:39,879 --> 00:46:42,757
Fauchon is still open!

322
00:46:44,279 --> 00:46:47,237
Oh!
- Ah! If this happens at the Swiss border,

323
00:46:47,279 --> 00:46:51,272
we're as good as dead!
- It's French border that is dangerous.

324
00:46:51,319 --> 00:46:54,709
French don't want their gold to leak
to Switzerland!

325
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:59,318
- Plug the toaster into the outlet.
- That'll teach me to let you fix something...

326
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:03,796
50 golden bars! You couldn't be trusted
even with the metal!

327
00:47:06,879 --> 00:47:10,155
- This too will have to do somehow. Jacques!
- What now?

328
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:15,911
- It feels like something is there.
- 200 bricks! Obviously, it's hard!

329
00:47:15,959 --> 00:47:19,349
- They won't feel anything.
- Jacques, my jewelry, where is it?

330
00:47:20,519 --> 00:47:24,512
- They were there on the front seat!
- Calm down, I put them down.

331
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:27,949
Stop saying "calm down",
it's becoming annoying!

332
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:33,319
Who is harassing me for 3 weeks now
with his revolution, who closed his factory..

333
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:37,318
out of fear it would be taken,
who's afraid of the workers, unions,

334
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:41,318
of the leftists, rightists, centrists?
- I'm not scared of anyone, Madame.

335
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:44,750
- And you know why? I bought everyone!
- Not the customs.

336
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:47,873
No, not the customs!

337
00:47:59,879 --> 00:48:03,269
Here is RTL Information,
edition of the mid-day

338
00:48:03,879 --> 00:48:07,792
presented by Jean-Pierre Farkas.
- During this last weekend ...

339
00:48:07,879 --> 00:48:11,269
of May 68 with no lottery, gas
and cigarettes,

340
00:48:11,879 --> 00:48:15,269
the French will follow on the radio
the negotiations ...

341
00:48:15,879 --> 00:48:19,269
which started at the hotel
du Chatelet, Rue de Grenelle

342
00:48:19,879 --> 00:48:22,871
between unions, employers ...

343
00:48:23,879 --> 00:48:26,473
and Georges Pompidou.

344
00:48:27,879 --> 00:48:31,838
A Memorandum of Understanding was presented
but more likely it will be rejected...

345
00:48:31,879 --> 00:48:35,838
by the vast majority of the strikers.
They discussion is still on-going,

346
00:48:35,879 --> 00:48:39,838
but the first movement of workers
was more like, "No, that's not it..."

347
00:48:39,879 --> 00:48:43,269
Did you hear this?
We give them this, and they want that!

348
00:48:43,919 --> 00:48:46,911
They will surrender everything!
They will give them all!

349
00:48:47,959 --> 00:48:51,031
Our France is over,
Our France is over.

350
00:48:59,879 --> 00:49:03,792
Eat your pâtée, Lulu, and you too
Gisele, and stop it.

351
00:49:03,879 --> 00:49:06,871
With your mania for bronzing,

352
00:49:07,879 --> 00:49:11,269
you'll get wrinkles before your age!
- Leave me alone! We didn't go to Cannes!

353
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:35,153
Ah! Get the thief!

354
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:40,431
What is it, Gisèle, the thief!

355
00:49:41,959 --> 00:49:44,951
Ah! Jacques! Stop him, get the thief!

356
00:49:46,279 --> 00:49:48,873
Murderer!

357
00:49:50,279 --> 00:49:52,076
Hold the thief!

358
00:49:53,679 --> 00:49:56,273
Help!

359
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:00,749
Ah! Ah! We should inform the police!
- But we can not!

360
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:05,318
They will find the gold and money
that I didn't declare for the taxes!

361
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:08,750
And do you know how much
will be the fine?

362
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:12,829
10 times what I have stolen!
I mean, what was stolen from us!

363
00:50:12,879 --> 00:50:16,838
- Thank God, I kept my jewelry!
- Hold on! Come Gisèle,

365
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:31,238
Try to contact Dijon, the hospital.
We've got severe damage here!

366
00:50:31,279 --> 00:50:34,828
Ok. Hello, hello,
give me Dijon, please.

367
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:39,157
- Chauvin, here is the pharmacy.
- Maybe we should make him a transfusion.

368
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:41,872
He keeps bleeding!

369
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:15,873
Power to the people!

370
00:51:15,919 --> 00:51:19,309
Look what they've done to him!
Murderers! Assholes!

371
00:51:42,879 --> 00:51:45,871
C.R.S: SS, C.R.S: SS! C.R.S: SS!

372
00:51:51,919 --> 00:51:53,910
Shit!

373
00:52:22,759 --> 00:52:25,751
The fascists in Poteau!

374
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:34,513
- Martial!
- Jump!

375
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:38,518
- I will dirty the seats!
- To hell with the seats, get on!

376
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:41,631
- Here! Dirty the seats he will!
- Well, you know...!

377
00:52:51,079 --> 00:52:54,992
Find me something posh to go with Bigogne.

378
00:52:58,359 --> 00:53:00,953
One second. A-ha!

379
00:53:02,399 --> 00:53:04,993
Ties from Hermès,

380
00:53:07,679 --> 00:53:10,671
pull-over from Christian Dior, nice, huh!

381
00:53:11,079 --> 00:53:13,673
Shoes from Weston.

382
00:53:13,759 --> 00:53:16,353
Nothing but "must-have"!

383
00:53:17,479 --> 00:53:21,392
That means something posh,
something that everyone wants to have!

384
00:53:21,519 --> 00:53:24,795
For example: in cars
Rolls is a "must-have"

385
00:53:25,559 --> 00:53:28,517
St. Tropez is also a "must", Meûgève...

386
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:31,949
I got it: Prison is not a "must-have"
- No, it's not a "must-have"

387
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:37,030
- Sometimes, health is a "must-have"
- Look at that, shoes in crocodile leather!

388
00:53:37,079 --> 00:53:40,469
Oh no, monsieur!
We don't wear crocodiles in 1968!

389
00:53:41,079 --> 00:53:45,038
- Oh yeah! It's not "must-have", is it?
- Exactly, it's more like 30-s

390
00:53:45,079 --> 00:53:48,071
You've got a taste of a nouveau-riche!

391
00:53:49,399 --> 00:53:52,471
I've got a taste like all the poor people.

392
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:56,472
Hey, look at you, you look posh
with all this, you've got some class.

393
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:00,111
- You think?
- Yep. Are you married?

394
00:54:01,079 --> 00:54:03,957
- No.
- You've got a babe, then?

395
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:07,037
- A what?
- A doll, a chick.

396
00:54:07,079 --> 00:54:10,355
Ah, you mean fiancée, a babe.

397
00:54:11,079 --> 00:54:14,469
- No, you know, I live with my father.
- At your age,

398
00:54:15,079 --> 00:54:19,038
you still live with your parents?
- He's a widower, so I live with him.

399
00:54:19,079 --> 00:54:22,469
Before I lived with a girl,
a girl like this,

400
00:54:23,079 --> 00:54:26,071
an orphan.
- Okay, and then?

401
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:30,518
Well, I thought it would be perfect,
she doesn't have a father, I got one.

402
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,357
And then...

403
00:54:34,399 --> 00:54:37,277
She didn't want yours?

404
00:54:37,959 --> 00:54:40,553
- No.
- Too bad!

405
00:54:41,479 --> 00:54:44,551
I'll tell you a thing about the orphans,

406
00:54:45,679 --> 00:54:48,751
if they aren't two, screw them!

407
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:53,990
Huh?

408
00:55:07,959 --> 00:55:12,032
Clothes only were worth millions!
3 manteaux from Dior,

409
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:15,469
6 suits from Chanel,
my evening gowns from Givenchy!

410
00:55:25,559 --> 00:55:28,027
All my Hermes scarves!

411
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:31,151
My Morabito shoes!
And my other Cartier watch!

412
00:55:31,879 --> 00:55:34,951
Stop speaking English, it is ridiculous!

413
00:55:37,679 --> 00:55:41,592
- Does he bite?
- Yes, he bites everyone except us.

414
00:55:45,559 --> 00:55:48,027
Gisèle, look!

415
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:50,673
The Rolls! Ah!

416
00:55:51,319 --> 00:55:54,197
- Help! Help!
- Why, what's wrong?

417
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:57,790
- You! Mind your own business!
What should we do?

418
00:55:59,159 --> 00:56:01,434
- No! Only not that!
- Why not?

419
00:56:01,479 --> 00:56:04,073
The cops!
- What?

420
00:56:04,399 --> 00:56:07,357
The cops!
- But do something!

421
00:56:07,399 --> 00:56:11,392
- Write down the car number!
- But I know it already, it's MY car!

422
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:34,119
- We'll get my dad and be on our way.
- No, oh! I'll wait for you, hurry up...

423
00:56:34,159 --> 00:56:37,435
No, come, I'll present you under a
false name.

424
00:56:38,159 --> 00:56:42,118
- No, we are in a hurry. It's late!
- And if I go alone,

425
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:46,119
they would want me to stay for dinner.
Come on, Martial, do it me.

426
00:56:46,159 --> 00:56:47,956
All right!

427
00:56:48,679 --> 00:56:51,671
You'll see, they are very nice people.

428
00:56:56,399 --> 00:57:01,234
I'll tell them that you are a colleague
from the office. Office behind the bars!

429
00:57:02,159 --> 00:57:04,627
Is it you, Jean-Philippe?

430
00:57:04,679 --> 00:57:07,637
- Yes, dad! This is my dad!
- Turn the light on!

431
00:57:07,679 --> 00:57:09,476
Yes, go!

432
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:14,635
My Jean-Philippe!

433
00:57:14,679 --> 00:57:18,069
- What are you doing here?
- They threw me out of the door.

434
00:57:18,679 --> 00:57:21,637
- Who, the Buteaux?
- Who else do you think?

435
00:57:21,679 --> 00:57:25,638
- But for how long are you sitting here?
- Since the afternoon news block on TV.

436
00:57:25,679 --> 00:57:30,116
The one who was sentenced to death and
escaped - is it him? Hello, young man!

437
00:57:31,159 --> 00:57:34,549
Hold on, I don't understand anything!
What happened?

438
00:57:35,159 --> 00:57:38,549
- I will not let anyone insult my son!
- It's stuck.

439
00:57:38,679 --> 00:57:42,069
- They were washing you with shit!
- It's stuck again.

440
00:57:42,679 --> 00:57:46,592
Two bastards with bastard children,
bastard past and future!

441
00:57:46,679 --> 00:57:49,637
- I like your old man a lot.
- Maybe you weren't polite with them?

442
00:57:49,679 --> 00:57:53,638
When they were talking about you on the TV,
they insulted you. So, I told them:

443
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:58,116
"You shouldn't insult someone who
has an appointment with General de Gaulle!"

444
00:57:58,679 --> 00:58:01,637
But you were always against the General!

445
00:58:01,679 --> 00:58:06,116
They took my chair and brought me here
without giving me a piece of shit to eat!

446
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:09,232
- You don't eat that.
- I don't care anymore!

447
00:58:10,879 --> 00:58:14,713
- Your cousins are really nice!
- What are you doing?

448
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:18,955
- The door|
- It's the old man, he's hungry, I bet.

449
00:58:19,159 --> 00:58:23,118
- He wouldn't reach for the door bell.
- I put him far away from it.

450
00:58:23,159 --> 00:58:27,118
- Maybe he'd like to apologize.
- Oh, you don't know this old devil!

451
00:58:27,159 --> 00:58:30,231
I will give him some soup anyway.

452
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:53,151
- But...
- Gaston, it's the escaped guy!

453
00:58:54,719 --> 00:58:57,153
- Papa, the fishy!
- Gangster!

454
00:58:57,199 --> 00:59:00,589
- Shut your hole, you son of a bitch!
- Stop it, Martial, let him go!

455
00:59:01,239 --> 00:59:03,833
It's my family!

456
00:59:08,679 --> 00:59:12,069
If someone has to destroy everything
here, it's got to be me!

457
00:59:17,319 --> 00:59:20,197
There!

458
00:59:21,479 --> 00:59:24,357
Here, Jean-Philippe! The ammo!

459
00:59:24,399 --> 00:59:26,390
Got it!

460
00:59:27,679 --> 00:59:31,718
- What's going on there?
- Nothing, it's a western on TV.

461
00:59:31,759 --> 00:59:36,753
- Sounds cool, what channel?
- The 2nd, but I think it'll be over soon!

462
00:59:37,159 --> 00:59:40,117
The violence has to stop...

463
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:45,233
Under the table, can't you see we're
serious? Under the table, all of you!

464
01:00:07,679 --> 01:00:11,672
Martial, the gas, look!
- Hey! Hey! Hey! Downstairs, quick!

465
01:00:14,679 --> 01:00:17,273
Oh! Junior!
- Go.

466
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:21,470
Will you be back to play with us?
- Ready, steady, go!

467
01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:34,835
Bastards!

468
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:38,037
Allez!

469
01:00:47,679 --> 01:00:51,069
- There's a little left!.
- Not enough! And the stations are closed.

470
01:00:51,679 --> 01:00:55,638
- We don't have money anyway!
- Not a problem, I can always..

471
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:59,638
Yeah, I know! Shake the owner!
Don't you think it's enough already?

472
01:00:59,679 --> 01:01:03,069
- You're still preaching, I'm surprised.
- Shut up!

473
01:01:03,679 --> 01:01:07,069
Don't fight, kids! I've got some pocket
money over here!

474
01:01:07,679 --> 01:01:10,671
It's not much, but hey...!

475
01:01:10,879 --> 01:01:14,838
Because of the strike of the
personnel of la S.N.C.F.

476
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:18,838
We are sorry to announce that the train 1017...

477
01:01:18,879 --> 01:01:22,269
destinated for Paris will stay in Auxerre...

478
01:01:22,879 --> 01:01:25,837
until the strike is over.

479
01:01:26,679 --> 01:01:29,751
- Gisèle!
- What! What else now?

480
01:01:30,679 --> 01:01:34,638
- Bastards! They are on strike!
- All the passengers are asked...

481
01:01:34,679 --> 01:01:38,069
to get off the train.
- Didn't I tell you this country is over?

482
01:01:38,679 --> 01:01:41,273
This country is ruined!

483
01:01:43,679 --> 01:01:46,637
I don't have any money left!

484
01:01:46,679 --> 01:01:50,069
Quick, we need to get money for the tickets!

485
01:01:50,679 --> 01:01:54,672
- Oh, my! He is heavy!
- Give him to me!

486
01:01:55,239 --> 01:01:59,630
Tomorrow we are going to the bank,
we are entitled to 500 francs each.

487
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:03,638
- And in the afternoon we're back in Paris.
- 500 francs! I'm getting sick when I think...

488
01:02:03,679 --> 01:02:07,592
about 200 million in that car!
- Pardon, go ahead, Madame.

489
01:02:07,679 --> 01:02:10,637
- Thank you, sir.
- After you, sir.

490
01:02:10,679 --> 01:02:14,069
- Only after you.
- No, no, you go first.

491
01:02:15,919 --> 01:02:18,797
- Over here!
- Don't shout like that...

492
01:02:21,679 --> 01:02:24,273
Hey, anybody there?

493
01:02:24,399 --> 01:02:27,789
- Hey, you, lazy asses!
- What's going on?

494
01:02:28,159 --> 01:02:32,118
- Didn't you hear? There's a strike!
- Yes, but we need our money back!

495
01:02:32,159 --> 01:02:36,118
- We just bought our tickets.
- Send in a letter, they will pay you back.

496
01:02:36,159 --> 01:02:39,549
Hold him. You will give us our money back,
my friend!

497
01:02:40,159 --> 01:02:43,549
- We don't give a shit about your idiotic strike.
- Hey, stop it.

498
01:02:43,679 --> 01:02:46,751
- Strikes are legal.
- Go to hell.

499
01:02:51,159 --> 01:02:55,072
- I don't give a damn about your legal stuff!
- So, what are we going to do?

500
01:02:55,159 --> 01:02:58,549
I see only one solution:
we spend the night in the Rolls and tomorrow..

501
01:02:59,159 --> 01:03:02,549
- Tomorrow what?
- Tomorrow, kids, will be a new day!

502
01:03:03,879 --> 01:03:08,316
- Give me your hand!
- Huh?

503
01:03:40,159 --> 01:03:43,231
Don't rush, the bank has just opened.

504
01:03:44,159 --> 01:03:47,151
I didn't get a minute of sleep this night.

505
01:03:57,679 --> 01:04:01,672
- Go in the queue like everybody else!
- We are so not everybody else!

506
01:04:03,679 --> 01:04:06,751
Hands up! If you move, I shoot!

507
01:04:07,159 --> 01:04:10,549
- Could I borrow your gun for a bit?
- What for?

508
01:04:11,159 --> 01:04:14,435
- To rob a bank!
- Fine, you can take it.

509
01:04:15,479 --> 01:04:19,392
- Here, bring it back when you're done!
- Can I have yours too?

510
01:04:19,799 --> 01:04:22,791
- Yes, sir.
- They look so real!

511
01:04:22,879 --> 01:04:25,757
If you say so.

512
01:04:29,399 --> 01:04:32,675
80, 90, and 100 which makes 1000.
- Thank you, sir.

513
01:04:34,359 --> 01:04:37,635
- Let's go.
- Hands up, nobody moves!

514
01:04:38,679 --> 01:04:42,069
It's a hold-up!
You, over there, get out of your aquarium.

515
01:04:43,279 --> 01:04:46,555
You put it here.
Quick, do it, good.

516
01:04:47,479 --> 01:04:50,357
Everybody down on the stomach!

517
01:04:52,159 --> 01:04:55,151
You too, bloodsuckers!

518
01:04:57,079 --> 01:05:00,071
What do you have there, Mommy?

519
01:05:02,839 --> 01:05:05,831
I said on the stomach!
Hey! Your shepherdess!

520
01:05:06,479 --> 01:05:09,073
Yes, sir.

521
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:12,028
Good.

522
01:05:20,279 --> 01:05:23,157
You hear this? Where is Martial?

523
01:05:23,679 --> 01:05:26,557
What's going on?

524
01:05:38,799 --> 01:05:41,393
Martial! Martial!

525
01:06:12,679 --> 01:06:15,671
Go, go, quick! Quick!

526
01:06:16,159 --> 01:06:20,118
Just so you know, what you've just done,
my little friend, is illegal.

527
01:06:20,159 --> 01:06:24,596
- You're my partner in crime now!
- Hide you, big mouth!

528
01:06:30,999 --> 01:06:34,958
We'll be out of gas soon, have you seen?

529
01:06:34,999 --> 01:06:37,354
Go straight ahead, we'll see then!

530
01:06:37,399 --> 01:06:40,277
He took all my jewels!

531
01:06:42,159 --> 01:06:45,037
- The Rolls.
- The Rolls. Oh!

532
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:50,273
Stop! Stop!

533
01:06:55,159 --> 01:06:58,549
- Our car!
- Was it your car, this Rolls?

534
01:06:58,679 --> 01:07:02,069
No, it wasn't our car. It was just a car.
Just a beautiful car!

535
01:07:02,679 --> 01:07:06,638
Come on, wake up, Gisèle. Let her go!
Wake up, Gisèle. Calm down!

536
01:07:06,679 --> 01:07:11,195
Enough crying, look! Come, come, I have
an idea, you'll see!

537
01:07:11,239 --> 01:07:15,232
- Hold on, I will need you as witnesses!
- We'll be right back!

538
01:07:17,159 --> 01:07:20,117
- How are you doing?
- Very well.

539
01:07:20,159 --> 01:07:23,549
Very very well, indeed!
Tell you something!

540
01:07:24,159 --> 01:07:28,152
I don't think it could be any better!

541
01:07:30,159 --> 01:07:34,357
- Quick! I need 302.20.20 in P.C.V.!
- Quick? There are 3 people before you!

542
01:07:34,399 --> 01:07:38,392
But it's a car! It will leave the zone
where we can reach it!

543
01:07:38,439 --> 01:07:40,953
- Fine, cabin number 1.
- Thank you, Miss, thank you!

544
01:07:40,999 --> 01:07:44,389
- First, cash.
- 100 francs for 50 liters? I could..

545
01:07:44,999 --> 01:07:47,991
stick my hand down your throat for that!

546
01:07:49,399 --> 01:07:52,391
Well, if you're that unhappy, you can...

547
01:07:52,439 --> 01:07:56,398
Take your stinking money! Here!
Don't choke on it!

548
01:07:56,439 --> 01:07:58,953
I count the drops.

549
01:08:03,159 --> 01:08:06,151
- Hello?
- You are being called from P.C.V. of Auxerre.

550
01:08:06,199 --> 01:08:10,636
- Auxerre! Who can it be?
- If it's the Buteau, tell them to piss off!

551
01:08:10,679 --> 01:08:13,273
I'm listening. Hello?

552
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:18,632
Is this the thief of my car that I'm
having the honour to speak to?

553
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:22,632
- No, it's his lawyer on the phone.
- Did you hear that? His lawyer!

554
01:08:22,679 --> 01:08:26,638
We only borrowed your car for a while
because of the C.R.S. and tomatoes!

555
01:08:26,679 --> 01:08:30,638
But once I meet General de Gaulle,
I have an appointment at 11:00...

556
01:08:30,679 --> 01:08:34,069
- But he's mad!
- I will go to police and return it.

557
01:08:34,159 --> 01:08:37,117
- No need to go to police!
- Why not?

558
01:08:37,159 --> 01:08:41,118
You know better than me that a good
arrangement is better than a bad trial!

559
01:08:41,159 --> 01:08:44,947
This Rolls is a collection item,
we are emotionally attached to it.

560
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,275
It's symbolic for us.

561
01:08:48,159 --> 01:08:51,117
- That's it, we can go now!
- Right.

562
01:08:51,159 --> 01:08:54,117
- Whom are you talking to?
- The owner of our car.

563
01:08:54,159 --> 01:08:57,231
Give it to me!
Go, start the car! Hello?

564
01:08:58,159 --> 01:09:01,549
So, I have an offer for you:
I'd like to buy out my car from you!

565
01:09:02,159 --> 01:09:03,956
How much?

566
01:09:04,159 --> 01:09:08,118
- 10 million, in fact, 100.000 in new francs.
- I could not disagree more!

567
01:09:08,159 --> 01:09:10,115
- Shut up right now!
- What did you say?

568
01:09:10,159 --> 01:09:14,118
Hello, yes, I see. Sorry, but they've already
offered me this much for the car details.

569
01:09:14,159 --> 01:09:18,118
If you want your pile of metal back in one
piece, you'll have to cash up for 20 million.

570
01:09:18,159 --> 01:09:21,549
in the bills of 500.. .
- But I don't have this money!

571
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:24,637
What do you mean we don't have it!
Give it to me! We will get it!

572
01:09:24,679 --> 01:09:29,116
Good, then call me back in the afternoon.
And no tricks, or...

573
01:09:29,159 --> 01:09:33,630
your collection item will be compressed
and sold to an amateur art lover.

574
01:09:33,679 --> 01:09:37,638
Don't you think it's strange? The guy
wants to buy out his own car?

575
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:41,592
- Well, 20 mln. is exactly what I need!
- No, no, no and no! Impossible!

576
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:45,672
What, now I can't sell my car, Maitre?

577
01:10:20,719 --> 01:10:24,678
- I'll leave you here and head for Elysees.
- No way. I'm waiting for an important call!

578
01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:28,678
And until I get this call, I'm not
stepping out of this car!

579
01:10:28,719 --> 01:10:33,031
That's it! I'm about to petition for your pardon!
"My General! The prisoner awaits outside...

580
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:37,710
in the Rolls. If you say "yes", he'll return
to prison. If "no", he'll escape.

581
01:11:02,879 --> 01:11:06,269
- It was him!
- And next to him - Tante Yvonne!

582
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:09,952
I'm late! He didn't wait for me!

583
01:11:16,439 --> 01:11:20,398
- Hide yourself! He shouldn't see you!
- Oh no, but I want to see him!

584
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:23,716
What a coincidence! Maybe he'll offer
us a cup of coffee! Turn!

585
01:11:23,959 --> 01:11:25,438
Are you crazy! Let me go.

586
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:12,036
Stay here.

587
01:13:28,679 --> 01:13:31,273
Oh, my General.

588
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:39,635
My General.

589
01:13:39,679 --> 01:13:42,557
I was searching for you,

590
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:47,638
Jean-Philippe Duroc, lawyer at the court,
you have granted me an appointment at 11 h.

591
01:13:47,679 --> 01:13:51,069
It's about Martial Gaulard.
He is General, my innocent!

592
01:13:51,239 --> 01:13:54,311
I mean, he is innocent, my General!

593
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:38,872
Thank you, my Général. Have a safe trip!

594
01:14:48,199 --> 01:14:50,633
Hello! Yes, it's me!

595
01:14:50,679 --> 01:14:54,638
I've got the money. 200.000 francs. 20 mln.
in the old money in the bills of 500.

596
01:14:54,679 --> 01:14:58,592
- As you said...
- Go down to the road in front of your house.

597
01:14:58,679 --> 01:15:01,637
- What address?
- 44, Avenue Foch.

598
01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:05,592
- Are you blond, dark haired? Fat, thin?
- I will go!

599
01:15:05,679 --> 01:15:09,592
- It will be my wife!
- Is she pretty or an old bat?

600
01:15:09,679 --> 01:15:13,069
- She's not an old bat...
- I will be wearing a sable jacket!

601
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:17,592
- She'll be wearing a sable jacket!
- And the car? Ask him!

602
01:15:21,079 --> 01:15:23,274
He hang up!

603
01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:31,069
Hey, you are not going to leave
just when Jean-Philippe...

604
01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:35,069
No, Marcel. Here are we
go separate ways!

605
01:15:35,399 --> 01:15:39,836
I was happy to get to know you!
Kiss your boy for me!

606
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:10,550
I got it! I got it! Your pardon!
He signed! Look!

607
01:16:11,159 --> 01:16:13,115
- But where is he?
- Gone!

608
01:16:13,159 --> 01:16:16,435
- Gone where?
- Avenue Foch, to pick up the cash.

609
01:16:17,159 --> 01:16:20,231
Oh! Bastard!
Oh no, no.. it can't be..

610
01:16:21,159 --> 01:16:24,674
I have to stop him!
Oh, goddammit.. no, no!

611
01:16:39,980 --> 01:16:42,972
Gisèle, I'll be watching you!
- Oh no!

612
01:17:06,979 --> 01:17:09,971
Hey, shall we go for a walk?
You coming?

613
01:17:13,179 --> 01:17:16,057
- How much?
- 20 million.

614
01:17:16,179 --> 01:17:19,569
20 million! Are you mad?
Have you seen yourself?

615
01:17:20,179 --> 01:17:23,057
You bastard!

616
01:17:23,419 --> 01:17:25,216
Giséle!

617
01:17:25,580 --> 01:17:28,174
- Was it him?
- No!

618
01:17:33,499 --> 01:17:36,377
Help! Catch the thief!

619
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:39,730
Catch the thief!

620
01:17:46,179 --> 01:17:49,569
- Gisèle, what happened?
- He ripped it out of my hands.

621
01:17:50,179 --> 01:17:52,977
I had it right here!

622
01:17:55,179 --> 01:17:58,057
And our car? Thief! Cheater!

623
01:17:58,179 --> 01:18:01,171
There! Jacques!
It's the Rolls!

624
01:18:03,380 --> 01:18:06,372
- The car, the car!
- Hurry up!

625
01:18:06,659 --> 01:18:09,731
Hurry up, it will be gone again!

626
01:18:12,499 --> 01:18:15,889
- Wait for me Jacques, wait for me!
- Stop, stop!

627
01:18:19,819 --> 01:18:22,413
Thief! Stop!

628
01:18:26,179 --> 01:18:28,170
Let's go, quick!

629
01:18:30,379 --> 01:18:32,973
Look, it's him!

630
01:18:40,419 --> 01:18:44,412
Forget it, we missed him,
Jean-Philippe, we'll never find him!

631
01:18:44,459 --> 01:18:47,496
Yes, we will find him!

632
01:19:07,979 --> 01:19:11,369
- Where is Bach-Yen?
- At the manifestation with her friends

633
01:19:12,179 --> 01:19:15,455
on the barricades.
- What are they doing there?

634
01:19:15,660 --> 01:19:18,936
- No idea. They are all crazy!

635
01:19:19,659 --> 01:19:22,173
Go now, last thing I need is a broken window!

636
01:19:48,499 --> 01:19:51,491
C.R.S: SS! C.R.S: SS! C.R.S: SS...

637
01:20:12,579 --> 01:20:15,457
Blanche Hirondelle, Bach-Yen!

638
01:20:15,779 --> 01:20:19,169
- Reinforce the barricades!
- Give it to me! Blanche Hirondelle!

639
01:21:58,659 --> 01:22:01,651
It rains, here... Shh!

640
01:22:36,779 --> 01:22:39,737
Not a way to calm down!

641
01:22:41,779 --> 01:22:45,613
Disappearance of the head of the state
considerably heated the atmosphere.

642
01:22:45,659 --> 01:22:47,456
I'm in the Latin Quarters. Quartier Latin,
agitation rises with every hour!

643
01:22:51,540 --> 01:22:54,930
Stop it, no, let me through!
Listen, let me pass!

644
01:22:56,179 --> 01:22:59,171
I'm not...
Stop it! Enough already....

645
01:23:00,179 --> 01:23:04,138
L'Etoile de Jade, is over there,
on the other corner of Boulevard St.-Germain.

646
01:23:04,179 --> 01:23:07,251
I am going to try to pass.
You got the petition?

647
01:23:08,179 --> 01:23:11,057
I put it in here.

648
01:23:11,179 --> 01:23:14,171
They are nice, the kids, right?

649
01:23:15,179 --> 01:23:18,569
Stop screwing around, kids!
This cars costs a lot!

650
01:23:19,179 --> 01:23:23,138
- It's a collection item.
- You are a collection item, bloodsucker!

651
01:23:23,179 --> 01:23:26,171
- Damned capitalist! Piece of shit!
- Are you for real? I am simple worker!

652
01:23:27,179 --> 01:23:30,171
I live off my pension!

653
01:23:31,179 --> 01:23:34,569
- All the old bastards should retire!
- Hello? Ah, no, no.

654
01:23:35,659 --> 01:23:39,049
It's not the thief,
it's the father of his lawyer.

655
01:23:39,900 --> 01:23:42,892
Speak up, I can't hear a thing!

656
01:23:44,179 --> 01:23:47,251
- Shut your holes!
- Old bastards should retire!

657
01:23:49,420 --> 01:23:52,696
What? Your car?
Your car is right here.

658
01:23:53,499 --> 01:23:56,889
You can come and pick it up,
crossroads of Mabillon.

659
01:23:57,899 --> 01:24:02,609
Before the road of Four. Hurry up,
'cause it's getting hot in here!

660
01:24:02,660 --> 01:24:05,732
Power to the people! Jobs to the young!

661
01:24:07,179 --> 01:24:09,773
Ah! For God's sake!

662
01:24:16,179 --> 01:24:20,092
Excuse me, can I go through,
I am a lawyer and I've got..

663
01:24:20,179 --> 01:24:23,569
a client who is over there.
- A client? Bad timing, don't you think?

664
01:24:24,179 --> 01:24:27,455
But it's just to tell him he was
granted a pardon!

665
01:24:27,660 --> 01:24:31,050
Excuse me! Please! Hey!

666
01:24:31,659 --> 01:24:33,809
Go, hurry up!

667
01:24:36,019 --> 01:24:39,011
Pardon, pardon, pardon, pardon!

668
01:24:56,179 --> 01:25:00,138
Here is Christian Brincourt directly from
the crossroads of Mabillon at the corner...

669
01:25:00,179 --> 01:25:04,138
of the street of Four. Demonstrators
act according to a developed strategy:

670
01:25:04,179 --> 01:25:08,138
Once the forces of government approach,
what is actually happening right now,

671
01:25:08,179 --> 01:25:12,092
the students step back and regroup behind
the barricades.

672
01:25:12,179 --> 01:25:15,171
Christian, isn't it the leftist lawyer?

673
01:25:15,660 --> 01:25:19,619
This is an unexpected turn of events!
We've just found...

674
01:25:19,659 --> 01:25:23,049
Maitre Duroc, for whom the police was
looking all over the country

675
01:25:26,219 --> 01:25:30,656
But I just want to pass behind the barricade
to see my client!

676
01:25:43,179 --> 01:25:47,411
Look at the screen.

677
01:25:47,459 --> 01:25:50,451
Wasn't it him who escaped together
with Gaulard?

678
01:25:57,179 --> 01:26:00,251
Yes, that's him!
I'll contact Rocheteau.

679
01:26:01,179 --> 01:26:04,057
He's out on patrol.

680
01:26:05,299 --> 01:26:07,767
I'm calling TO.657.

681
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:16,094
Hello, it's TO.657.

682
01:26:17,539 --> 01:26:20,531
Duroc is showing off at the barricades.
- Where is it?

683
01:26:20,579 --> 01:26:24,572
Crossroads of Mabillon, corner of the Four street.
- Go, go, quickly!

684
01:26:25,660 --> 01:26:29,619
- Where did you leave your motorcycle?
- I hid it over there.

685
01:26:33,379 --> 01:26:37,736
Excuse me, young man, would you kindly
direct me to the crossroads of Mabillon?

686
01:26:37,779 --> 01:26:42,773
- Over there! But it's a mess!
- Thank you, come Gisèle!

687
01:26:46,179 --> 01:26:49,137
- Get out of the car!
- I can't, I've got arthritis!

688
01:26:49,179 --> 01:26:52,171
Then you need a wheelchair, not a Rolls!

689
01:27:13,580 --> 01:27:16,048
Jump, quickly!

690
01:27:19,179 --> 01:27:22,057
Hold this, I'll be right back!

691
01:27:40,579 --> 01:27:43,571
Marcel! Come here, big boy, come on!

692
01:28:01,540 --> 01:28:04,930
The Rolls is packed with money!
200.000 at least!

693
01:28:05,059 --> 01:28:08,051
Hey you, Popeye!
Hold this for me!

694
01:28:19,899 --> 01:28:22,971
- Martial! Where's dad?
- Don't worry, he's here

695
01:28:26,420 --> 01:28:29,298
What the hell are you doing?

696
01:28:30,379 --> 01:28:33,257
-But, but..
- Jean-Philippe!

697
01:28:40,179 --> 01:28:42,773
The Rolls, there!

698
01:28:51,739 --> 01:28:54,207
It's burning! No, no....

699
01:28:54,259 --> 01:28:58,252
- Oh, mon Dieu!
- Hold on, it's not the right time!

700
01:29:00,979 --> 01:29:03,971
It's a disaster! Look at it! It's terrible!

701
01:29:19,899 --> 01:29:23,289
Oh Jacques, we lost everything!
- Gisèle, calm down!

702
01:29:23,419 --> 01:29:26,809
- Stop whining!
- I don't want to see it! It hurts!

703
01:29:42,179 --> 01:29:43,976
Thank you.

704
01:29:45,219 --> 01:29:48,609
- Do you think it's fair?
- What? All those burning cars?

705
01:29:49,580 --> 01:29:52,970
No, that my boy, an honest man,
will go to prison?

706
01:29:53,579 --> 01:29:56,571
While you will remain free?

707
01:30:34,379 --> 01:30:37,769
- Did they arrest you?
- Are you kidding? I'm turning myself in!

708
01:30:38,900 --> 01:30:41,972
I cam to turn myself in, Judge.

709
01:30:42,379 --> 01:30:44,847
Can I?

710
01:30:44,899 --> 01:30:48,858
I'm warning you, from this moment on,
everything you say....

711
01:30:48,899 --> 01:30:53,131
could be used against you.
- It was me who attacked the security guard.

712
01:30:53,179 --> 01:30:57,138
- Note it down, please.
- Do not lie! I got your petition!

713
01:30:57,179 --> 01:31:01,138
- You will be free in 30 years!
- Please, Duroc, calm down.

714
01:31:01,179 --> 01:31:04,455
Mr. Bâtonnier you will be a witness...
What am I saying...

715
01:31:05,659 --> 01:31:09,049
Your honour, having worked in the
Advocacy of Paris for 10 years,

716
01:31:09,659 --> 01:31:13,618
I never let the slightest...
- Wait! I robbed the bank,

717
01:31:13,660 --> 01:31:17,619
hi-jacked the Rolls, the truck with tomatoes,
the car of Mr. Duroc, whom I...

718
01:31:17,659 --> 01:31:22,130
forced to go with me by threatening him.
- See, my colleague Duroc is innocent.

719
01:31:22,179 --> 01:31:25,171
He was my hostage all this time!

720
01:31:25,699 --> 01:31:28,975
Gaulard, why are you doing this?
- So, Mr. Writer?

721
01:31:30,299 --> 01:31:33,177
Can sign your novel already?

722
01:31:37,219 --> 01:31:40,097
Yep, looks fine to me.

723
01:31:44,219 --> 01:31:47,609
Can I borrow your pen, your honour?

724
01:31:48,419 --> 01:31:51,297
Pardon, thanks. I sign:

725
01:31:51,739 --> 01:31:54,333
Martial Gaulard,

726
01:31:55,179 --> 01:31:58,057
being sound of mind and memory.

727
01:32:02,900 --> 01:32:06,893
Because I'm not crazy, your honour,
and I will prove it to you.

728
01:32:17,259 --> 01:32:20,137
Move back, Gaulard!

729
01:32:23,299 --> 01:32:27,656
Move over! Martial, you are putting
yourself in a difficult situation!

730
01:32:27,699 --> 01:32:30,611
Let me go! Let me go!

731
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:40,378
Help! Help me!

732
01:32:41,219 --> 01:32:44,097
- Hold the bike.
- Help!!

733
01:32:53,019 --> 01:32:55,214
- Better?
- Yeah.

734
01:32:55,259 --> 01:32:58,251
And thanks for the petition anyway!

735
01:32:58,659 --> 01:33:00,650
Martial!
- Yeah?

736
01:33:11,659 --> 01:33:14,253
- See you!
- See ya!
