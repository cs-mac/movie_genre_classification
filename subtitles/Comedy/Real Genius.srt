1
00:02:22,064 --> 00:02:25,400
<i>Crossbow, this is Watchdog.
Confirm transmissions.</i>

2
00:02:25,692 --> 00:02:31,406
<i>Roger, Watchdog. Crossbow is on
Discriminator, and all systems are go.</i>

3
00:02:33,825 --> 00:02:38,080
<i>Roger, we mark you go
for maneuvering sequence.</i>

4
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:44,253
Watchdog, this is Crossbow.
Confirm we are go for arm.

5
00:02:44,545 --> 00:02:46,004
<i>Affirmative, Crossbow.</i>

6
00:02:46,296 --> 00:02:51,468
<i>Select electrics to max, vents
to open, and systems to onboard.</i>

7
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,179
<i>- Roger. Crossbow is armed.
- Roger.</i>

8
00:02:54,429 --> 00:02:57,140
<i>We have confirmation.
Rabbit in the hole.</i>

9
00:02:57,432 --> 00:03:00,602
Moving Target Indicator, engaged.

10
00:03:00,853 --> 00:03:04,857
<i>- Pathfinder on. I'm going on the scope.
- Roger.</i>

11
00:03:07,401 --> 00:03:08,652
<i>Scanner on.</i>

12
00:03:09,194 --> 00:03:11,864
Target locked.
Tracking locked.

13
00:03:12,155 --> 00:03:15,367
<i>- Roger.
- Easy does it. That's it.</i>

14
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:17,619
Hold it right there.

15
00:03:31,383 --> 00:03:33,510
<i>The Crossbow Project.</i>

16
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,056
<i>- There's no defence like a good offense.
- Mission accomplished.</i>

17
00:03:39,516 --> 00:03:44,229
<i>- Outstanding, Crossbow.
- Just like shooting ducks in a barrel.</i>

18
00:03:44,521 --> 00:03:48,150
<i>Our scientists are
turning an engineering dream...</i>

19
00:03:48,442 --> 00:03:53,197
<i>...into an effective reality.
- All we have to do is build it.</i>

20
00:03:53,488 --> 00:03:57,201
- Nice weapon, isn't it?
- What did you think, Roy?

21
00:03:57,492 --> 00:04:00,454
I think there weren't
enough girls in it.

22
00:04:00,787 --> 00:04:04,708
I have a tape on alternate uses,
mini-shuttle plans...

23
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:07,878
...and B-1 modifications
for aerial launch.

24
00:04:08,128 --> 00:04:11,048
Does any responsible agency
know about this?

25
00:04:11,298 --> 00:04:14,593
It's a need-to-know basis.
The CIA's responsible.

26
00:04:14,885 --> 00:04:19,014
They do need to know.
You're gonna cause an escalation.

27
00:04:19,306 --> 00:04:23,644
Our studies indicate
this weapon is useless in warfare.

28
00:04:23,936 --> 00:04:29,191
It's not for war. It's a peacetime
weapon. That's why it's secret.

29
00:04:29,483 --> 00:04:33,487
- So it's both immoral and unethical?
- Yes.

30
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:35,864
When do we get it?

31
00:04:36,156 --> 00:04:40,536
There is a tiny technical
problem with the energy source...

32
00:04:40,827 --> 00:04:45,165
I don't want problems.
We have plans for it this summer.

33
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:50,504
I need a success. I don't need
any delays jeopardizing that.

34
00:04:50,796 --> 00:04:53,882
- Am I making myself clear?
- Clear as vodka.

35
00:04:54,174 --> 00:04:57,010
Tell Dr. Hathaway to get on the stick.

36
00:04:57,302 --> 00:05:02,307
- I'm gonna have to push harder.
- As long as we have a weapon by June.

37
00:05:02,599 --> 00:05:04,268
- Right?
- I wouldn't know.

38
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,604
I haven't had
a working weapon since Korea.

39
00:05:08,772 --> 00:05:11,233
I'm sorry, this is too much.

40
00:05:11,525 --> 00:05:16,071
- I'm gonna ask for a reassignment.
- I'm sorry to hear that, George.

41
00:05:21,493 --> 00:05:22,744
I urge you to stop.

42
00:05:23,036 --> 00:05:26,665
Thanks for your input.
Sorry you won't be on the team.

43
00:05:26,915 --> 00:05:28,917
Maybe next time.

44
00:05:29,209 --> 00:05:32,838
Too bad. Used to be a good man.

45
00:05:33,088 --> 00:05:36,383
I'm afraid we're gonna
have to liberate George.

46
00:05:40,554 --> 00:05:44,558
Liberate? You mean, liquidate?

47
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:50,189
Let's see that film on blinding
techniques. Then we'll have lunch.

48
00:06:07,998 --> 00:06:12,252
- Could you sign this?
- Are you Doctor Hathaway?

49
00:06:12,503 --> 00:06:19,134
- I just loved your television show.
- Thank you. That's very kind of you.

50
00:06:19,635 --> 00:06:25,349
- What is Mr. Einstein really like?
- Dead.

51
00:06:25,682 --> 00:06:31,021
Dad, laser means light amplification
by stimulated emissions of radiation.

52
00:06:31,313 --> 00:06:33,565
So this is coherent light.

53
00:06:33,857 --> 00:06:37,236
- Oh, so it talks, right?
- No.

54
00:06:37,486 --> 00:06:40,447
- Dr. Hathaway, what a surprise!
- How are you?

55
00:06:40,739 --> 00:06:45,494
Is something wrong with the test
scores? If there is, it's because...

56
00:06:45,744 --> 00:06:48,747
I thought I'd bring
you the news myself.

57
00:06:48,997 --> 00:06:53,585
I got word from admissions.
Mitch is in at Pacific Tech.

58
00:06:53,877 --> 00:06:55,462
- Wonderful!
- Way to go!

59
00:06:55,754 --> 00:06:57,339
Don't shake his head!

60
00:06:57,631 --> 00:06:59,216
- How you doing?
- Fine.

61
00:06:59,508 --> 00:07:01,718
- Nice display here.
- Thanks.

62
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:05,889
It's a flash lamp
ultraviolet laser at 342 nanometres.

63
00:07:06,181 --> 00:07:10,853
As you know, there is interest
in the iodine laser for fusion.

64
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:16,441
This is molecular iodine. This laser
doesn't suffer from recombination.

65
00:07:17,234 --> 00:07:18,569
You must be proud.

66
00:07:18,861 --> 00:07:20,070
- Proud?
- Sure.

67
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:24,116
He's the first student we've
accepted for winter term.

68
00:07:25,367 --> 00:07:29,496
- I bet he's the youngest too.
- The youngest was 12.

69
00:07:29,746 --> 00:07:31,915
He cracked under the pressure...

70
00:07:32,207 --> 00:07:35,252
He's 15. There won't be any problem.

71
00:07:35,502 --> 00:07:40,424
Listen, about the scholarship.
You're gonna give him a bonus, right?

72
00:07:40,674 --> 00:07:44,636
No. But by allowing Mitch to progress
at a quicker rate...

73
00:07:44,928 --> 00:07:49,516
...we give him the chance to fill
a greater portion of his potential.

74
00:07:49,766 --> 00:07:55,105
We want the best for Mitchie. I saw
your show on radioactive isotopes.

75
00:07:55,355 --> 00:07:57,816
- And I've got a question.
- Yes?

76
00:07:58,108 --> 00:08:00,569
- Is that your real hair?
- Yeah?

77
00:08:01,195 --> 00:08:04,031
- Tell me, is Mitch adopted?
- Why, no!

78
00:08:04,323 --> 00:08:06,116
- It's amazing.
- Isn't it?

79
00:08:06,366 --> 00:08:08,577
I need something to eat. Come on.

80
00:08:08,869 --> 00:08:11,955
- Bye, Dr. Hathaway.
- Goodbye.

81
00:08:13,749 --> 00:08:16,001
See you later, honey.

82
00:08:16,251 --> 00:08:20,506
They're okay. Sometimes they
don't know what I'm talking about.

83
00:08:20,797 --> 00:08:25,344
I'm sure about that. Tell me,
are you gonna miss your friends?

84
00:08:25,636 --> 00:08:29,139
- No, I think I intimidate other kids.
- Good boy.

85
00:08:29,806 --> 00:08:35,354
Understand, compared to you, most
people have the IQ of a carrot.

86
00:08:35,646 --> 00:08:38,899
We're different from most people.
Better. I'm...

87
00:08:39,191 --> 00:08:43,278
- There you are, doctor!
- Hi. Yes, one second.

88
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:48,450
I've put you on my research team
with the best minds. This is only...

89
00:08:48,742 --> 00:08:53,664
...the second time for a freshman.
- The first was Chris Knight, right?

90
00:08:53,914 --> 00:08:56,917
- You've heard of him?
- He's a physics legend.

91
00:08:57,167 --> 00:09:02,589
You'll be working with him. He's
a senior now, as brilliant as ever.

92
00:09:02,965 --> 00:09:04,925
Wow!

93
00:09:06,468 --> 00:09:09,972
- This job will be waiting, Chris.
- Great.

94
00:09:10,264 --> 00:09:13,892
- We have a physical plant here.
- You have a Jacuzzi?

95
00:09:14,142 --> 00:09:15,602
- Absolutely.
- Good.

96
00:09:15,853 --> 00:09:20,566
And the labs and offices are
over this way. Follow me, please.

97
00:09:30,033 --> 00:09:32,035
Guys!

98
00:09:32,369 --> 00:09:36,456
- Meet Chris Knight. This is Sherry.
- Pleased to meet you.

99
00:09:36,707 --> 00:09:39,418
- This is Mike Dodd.
- Dr. Dodd?

100
00:09:39,668 --> 00:09:44,339
- He designed our new Telcom satellite.
- It's an honour to meet you.

101
00:09:44,631 --> 00:09:46,258
Telcom.

102
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:49,761
The satellite raining debris
all over Europe?

103
00:09:50,012 --> 00:09:51,763
Why is that on your head?

104
00:09:52,055 --> 00:09:54,975
If I wear it anywhere else,
it chafes.

105
00:09:55,225 --> 00:09:58,979
I'm sorry. I didn't want you
to think I was stuffy.

106
00:09:59,271 --> 00:10:03,317
You know, no fun.
All brain, no penis.

107
00:10:03,817 --> 00:10:05,652
- Pardon me?
- I'm sorry.

108
00:10:05,903 --> 00:10:08,614
It's an infantile response
to authority.

109
00:10:08,864 --> 00:10:13,076
- You are Chris Knight?
- I hope so. I'm wearing his underwear.

110
00:10:13,327 --> 00:10:16,288
It's a joke! I get it!
Funny!

111
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,790
I can't help it.
You're such fun.

112
00:10:19,082 --> 00:10:22,127
We try to be.
Isn't that right, Mike?

113
00:10:22,419 --> 00:10:24,171
No.

114
00:10:24,421 --> 00:10:30,469
Sherry's gonna show you around. Ask
questions about benefits, dress codes.

115
00:10:30,761 --> 00:10:33,597
- I'll see you in my office later.
- Great.

116
00:10:33,889 --> 00:10:38,977
Take care of him. He's one of the ten
finest minds in the country!

117
00:10:39,228 --> 00:10:41,897
Someday I hope to be two of them.

118
00:10:44,483 --> 00:10:46,485
- You are beautiful.
- Thanks.

119
00:10:46,735 --> 00:10:48,195
Did I come off stuffy?

120
00:10:48,487 --> 00:10:51,532
You don't act like
one of the top ten minds.

121
00:10:51,782 --> 00:10:54,243
- How many have you met?
- Seven.

122
00:10:54,535 --> 00:10:56,787
- Really?
- You'll be eight.

123
00:10:57,871 --> 00:11:00,916
Professor Hostetler was number six.

124
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:04,378
Old Professor Hostetler?
Isn't he dead?

125
00:11:06,004 --> 00:11:08,131
He is now.

126
00:11:14,555 --> 00:11:17,391
Hello. I'm looking
for the Freshman Tea?

127
00:11:17,683 --> 00:11:21,186
Oh, good. I'm so glad
we have one then.

128
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:25,065
- I don't think so.
- Gene.

129
00:11:25,315 --> 00:11:29,278
- This is Mitch Taylor.
- Hathaway's bright star.

130
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:32,489
- Yes, sir.
- You're already on his project.

131
00:11:32,781 --> 00:11:36,159
- We expect great things from you.
- I hope so.

132
00:11:36,451 --> 00:11:39,997
- A bit of advice.
- Oh, thank you.

133
00:11:40,414 --> 00:11:42,624
Always...

134
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:46,336
Never forget to check
your references.

135
00:11:48,964 --> 00:11:52,217
Okay. Thank you.

136
00:11:52,509 --> 00:11:54,928
I better be going. Sorry.

137
00:11:56,430 --> 00:12:00,767
The young people enjoy it
when I "get down" verbally.

138
00:12:02,436 --> 00:12:04,688
Where's the funeral?

139
00:12:15,657 --> 00:12:18,452
How you doing, sport?

140
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:23,874
Hey, Bobby, wait up, man!

141
00:12:26,043 --> 00:12:29,713
See if he's in his room.
He might be in there.

142
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:07,668
Hello?

143
00:13:16,301 --> 00:13:19,096
- What kind of place is this?
- Hi.

144
00:13:19,388 --> 00:13:23,308
Would you be prepared
if gravity reversed itself?

145
00:13:24,476 --> 00:13:28,105
I can't figure out how
to keep change in my pocket.

146
00:13:28,397 --> 00:13:31,149
I've got it! Nudity!

147
00:13:32,401 --> 00:13:33,986
I was here earlier...

148
00:13:34,278 --> 00:13:36,280
- You didn't straighten up?
- No.

149
00:13:36,572 --> 00:13:41,702
Good. All my filth is in alphabetical
order. This was under "H" for toy.

150
00:13:41,994 --> 00:13:43,120
What is that?

151
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:45,455
It's a penis stretcher.

152
00:13:45,747 --> 00:13:46,999
- Wanna try it?
- No!

153
00:13:47,374 --> 00:13:53,922
I'm kidding. It's another diversion
in an attempt to avoid responsibility.

154
00:13:54,214 --> 00:13:56,675
I left my bags. Now they're empty.

155
00:13:57,217 --> 00:14:01,471
You see, Mitch, I used to be you.

156
00:14:04,099 --> 00:14:09,271
I've been missing me, so I asked
if I could room with me again.

157
00:14:09,563 --> 00:14:12,482
I put your stuff in the bottom drawer.

158
00:14:12,774 --> 00:14:16,236
I threw out the sports jacket.
Duck!

159
00:14:17,404 --> 00:14:20,866
Nice reflexes. I'm Chris Knight.

160
00:14:21,116 --> 00:14:23,202
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes. Duck again!

161
00:14:27,539 --> 00:14:32,544
Oh, my God! It's heading
for the gas tanks. Duck!

162
00:14:34,963 --> 00:14:38,717
Was that a launch problem
or a design problem?

163
00:14:40,385 --> 00:14:43,889
- We're falling behind.
- We're not making sandwiches.

164
00:14:44,473 --> 00:14:46,517
Get down!

165
00:14:46,892 --> 00:14:49,853
Are you crazy?
You could have killed us!

166
00:14:50,145 --> 00:14:52,564
I cannot be seen with you.

167
00:14:52,814 --> 00:14:56,318
But since I'm driving,
shouldn't you be hiding?

168
00:14:56,568 --> 00:14:58,695
He saw me.

169
00:14:59,154 --> 00:15:04,743
The climate has changed. We need a
working model in four months, not 18.

170
00:15:05,202 --> 00:15:08,205
You can't dictate innovation, Don.

171
00:15:08,497 --> 00:15:10,207
I'll put it another way.

172
00:15:10,457 --> 00:15:13,836
- You know the money for development?
- Yes.

173
00:15:14,127 --> 00:15:19,466
When a project gets cut off, the
finance boys always run an audit.

174
00:15:19,716 --> 00:15:21,760
I see.

175
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:29,685
Having a little work done on
the old place, Jer? Fraud is a felony.

176
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,235
What are you looking at?
You're labourers!

177
00:15:38,485 --> 00:15:41,822
That's what you get
for not having an education.

178
00:15:42,114 --> 00:15:46,785
Get out of here!
Go on! Get out!

179
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:49,538
- Got it!
- Yeah!

180
00:16:02,801 --> 00:16:04,094
Are you two...?

181
00:16:04,386 --> 00:16:05,429
- Hey!
- Yes?

182
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:08,140
- Put down the sandwiches and go.
- Me?

183
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:10,851
- No, Yoda. Yeah, you!
- Just a bit.

184
00:16:11,101 --> 00:16:12,895
- I don't have any...
- Brains?

185
00:16:13,187 --> 00:16:15,606
- No. Sandwiches.
- What good are you?

186
00:16:15,898 --> 00:16:19,401
- What will we eat?
- Are you from the restaurant?

187
00:16:19,693 --> 00:16:25,782
No! I'm Mitch Taylor. I'm a student.
Dr. Hathaway told me to come up here.

188
00:16:27,492 --> 00:16:30,704
So you're the new stud, are you?

189
00:16:31,455 --> 00:16:34,374
- How do you mean?
- Stud. Hotshot. Brain.

190
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:38,504
- You're 12, right?
- I'm 15. Are you expecting him...?

191
00:16:38,754 --> 00:16:41,089
Yeah. Can I get you something?

192
00:16:41,381 --> 00:16:46,053
- A balloon?
- I'm supposed to check over your work.

193
00:16:46,345 --> 00:16:49,139
- Check it over?
- Well, yes.

194
00:16:49,389 --> 00:16:51,475
- For what?
- Mistakes, I guess.

195
00:16:51,767 --> 00:16:57,231
- He said you guys were stuck.
- No! Let's get something clear here.

196
00:16:57,523 --> 00:17:01,068
Okay, when Jerry's not here,
you do what I say.

197
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,281
It goes from God to Jerry to me.
Get it?

198
00:17:08,659 --> 00:17:09,701
Hello, Jerry.

199
00:17:10,077 --> 00:17:14,081
- You don't get to use my first name.
- Did I?

200
00:17:14,456 --> 00:17:18,544
How you doing, Mitch?
I'm sure you'll all be friends.

201
00:17:18,836 --> 00:17:20,629
- We're on our way.
- Good.

202
00:17:20,921 --> 00:17:24,216
I want you to take
your cues from Mitch.

203
00:17:24,508 --> 00:17:28,178
His ideas are
the most original I've seen.

204
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:32,266
- So Mitch is in charge of the group.
- Really, Jerry?

205
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:35,102
- You're doing it again.
- Oh, am I?

206
00:17:35,394 --> 00:17:40,649
- Where is Knight?
- He didn't bother to come in today.

207
00:17:40,899 --> 00:17:43,402
- Yes?
- He said he didn't feel like it.

208
00:17:43,694 --> 00:17:48,365
I said, "You better or you'll be
in trouble." He said, "Jam it!"

209
00:17:48,657 --> 00:17:52,953
- Great. You're not stuttering.
- I give myself shock treatments.

210
00:17:53,203 --> 00:17:54,454
Up the voltage.

211
00:17:54,746 --> 00:17:58,208
- I'm sorry he's not here...
- That clown? Look!

212
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:01,170
Kent decided to start without him.

213
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:05,215
The yield's insignificant.
We think the sample's damaged.

214
00:18:05,591 --> 00:18:09,052
- What?
- Obviously the result of negligence.

215
00:18:09,344 --> 00:18:13,849
It'll take a week to prepare a new
sample. I was afraid of this.

216
00:18:14,099 --> 00:18:16,643
- Are you sure?
- We're sure. Positive.

217
00:18:16,935 --> 00:18:19,897
- Excuse me.
- There is no excuse for it.

218
00:18:20,189 --> 00:18:24,484
- Yeah, Mitch, what is it?
- The pump laser is down.

219
00:18:24,776 --> 00:18:26,528
Look.

220
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,409
There.

221
00:18:32,701 --> 00:18:35,996
Well, it seems to be all better now.

222
00:18:36,246 --> 00:18:39,082
Don't touch other people's things!

223
00:18:39,374 --> 00:18:42,794
- Kent, I need you.
- Anything, Jerry.

224
00:18:43,086 --> 00:18:46,798
What? Do you want me to teach
your class for you?

225
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:51,136
No, I need you to get copies
of all the data so far.

226
00:18:51,345 --> 00:18:54,681
So Mitch can check
everything tomorrow.

227
00:18:54,932 --> 00:18:58,477
- My pleasure.
- After that, stop by my cleaners.

228
00:18:58,769 --> 00:19:00,729
Don't give it a thought.

229
00:19:00,979 --> 00:19:04,316
- Mitch, shall we? On the moment.
- Sure.

230
00:19:09,738 --> 00:19:14,868
Well, I guess it goes from God
to Jerry to you...

231
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,412
...to the cleaners.

232
00:19:17,704 --> 00:19:20,123
Right, Kent?

233
00:19:22,042 --> 00:19:27,422
Library. Library... 205.

234
00:19:37,516 --> 00:19:42,104
Welcome to Pacific Tech's
"Smart People on Ice."

235
00:19:44,147 --> 00:19:47,484
Let's go skating.

236
00:19:47,776 --> 00:19:50,279
Ick, the ice turned out great!

237
00:19:50,529 --> 00:19:53,699
Yeah, it worked, didn't it?

238
00:19:53,991 --> 00:19:55,784
- How did you do it?
- Sure.

239
00:19:56,076 --> 00:20:02,040
I tell you, you tell somebody else,
next we're in another ice age.

240
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:06,670
- Everybody must be skating.
- You're a slack!

241
00:20:06,962 --> 00:20:09,131
- Moles and trolls.
- What?

242
00:20:09,423 --> 00:20:12,759
Moles and trolls. Work.
We never see daylight.

243
00:20:13,051 --> 00:20:17,139
We plan for weeks and all
they do is study. I'm disgusted.

244
00:20:17,389 --> 00:20:21,351
I'm sorry, but it's not like me.
I'm depressed.

245
00:20:21,643 --> 00:20:26,064
We had one entry for the Madame Curie
look-alike contest...

246
00:20:26,356 --> 00:20:31,278
...and he was disqualified later.
Why do I bother?

247
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:34,740
Let's go! What are you,
a bunch of weirdos?

248
00:20:35,032 --> 00:20:39,369
- Want a cherry? I grow them myself.
- What?

249
00:20:40,078 --> 00:20:42,915
Okay, push once.

250
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:49,755
Are you okay?

251
00:20:50,923 --> 00:20:54,635
No, not emotionally.
I'm disappointed. Not terribly.

252
00:20:54,885 --> 00:20:57,387
It should have gone further, faster.

253
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:01,058
The problem is obviously
the drag coefficient.

254
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:04,853
I'll have to redesign the blades.
I can do that.

255
00:21:05,103 --> 00:21:08,315
But I've got to cut them,
and that takes time.

256
00:21:08,565 --> 00:21:11,735
- How long will this last?
- Maybe a half an hour.

257
00:21:12,027 --> 00:21:13,987
That's great. I can do that.

258
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:16,490
- Okay. What's your name?
- Mitch.

259
00:21:16,782 --> 00:21:19,243
Thanks for your help.
See you later.

260
00:21:19,535 --> 00:21:21,119
You're welcome!

261
00:21:21,411 --> 00:21:22,913
- Who was that?
- That...

262
00:21:23,163 --> 00:21:27,334
I'm Jordan. I heard there was
someone new. Are you it?

263
00:21:27,626 --> 00:21:28,710
Yes.

264
00:21:29,002 --> 00:21:30,629
- Do you have a bed?
- Yeah.

265
00:21:30,879 --> 00:21:35,259
I'd make you one, but you have one.
Okay, see you later. Bye.

266
00:21:35,509 --> 00:21:37,344
Bye.

267
00:21:40,097 --> 00:21:43,058
- What's all this?
- This? This is ice.

268
00:21:43,308 --> 00:21:46,103
This is what happens
when water gets cold.

269
00:21:46,353 --> 00:21:51,733
This is Kent. This is what happens
when people get sexually frustrated.

270
00:21:52,901 --> 00:21:54,695
This should keep you busy.

271
00:21:54,987 --> 00:21:58,699
This with your classes should
turn your brain to mush.

272
00:21:58,991 --> 00:22:03,203
That's unfair. And we were gonna
make you carnival king.

273
00:22:03,495 --> 00:22:05,581
Yeah?

274
00:22:05,831 --> 00:22:09,251
Ha, ha. You're in on this too.
Did you make it?

275
00:22:09,459 --> 00:22:11,837
- I'm not saying.
- Who'll clean it?

276
00:22:12,087 --> 00:22:16,341
You don't have to.
It's gonna go directly to gas.

277
00:22:16,592 --> 00:22:18,010
Really? What is it?

278
00:22:18,343 --> 00:22:21,805
All I can tell you is
it's rare and unstable.

279
00:22:22,097 --> 00:22:23,849
Just like you.

280
00:22:24,057 --> 00:22:26,018
- You're degenerates.
- We are?

281
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:29,313
- I found you naked with Jell-O!
- You did not!

282
00:22:29,563 --> 00:22:30,731
This is true.

283
00:22:31,023 --> 00:22:34,109
I was hot, and I was hungry. Okay?

284
00:22:34,735 --> 00:22:36,862
I got news for you, Knight.

285
00:22:37,112 --> 00:22:39,948
- You're not first anymore.
- First what?

286
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,286
- Mitch beat your scores by 20 points.
- Yeah, you did?

287
00:22:44,536 --> 00:22:48,290
- You think you're hot stuff, huh?
- No.

288
00:22:48,582 --> 00:22:50,792
Maybe you are smarter than me.

289
00:22:51,084 --> 00:22:53,670
But can you do this?

290
00:23:01,512 --> 00:23:05,557
- Ick, what's happening with the ice?
- Open a window!

291
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:10,062
Ick, I'm melting!

292
00:23:10,479 --> 00:23:12,064
- It worked!
- Neat!

293
00:23:12,356 --> 00:23:17,444
- Now if we can keep it from exploding.
- Exploding? Oh, God.

294
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:23,534
Hey, Ick. You're just joking
about exploding, right?

295
00:23:23,825 --> 00:23:27,412
Ick? It's a joke, right?

296
00:24:33,896 --> 00:24:38,775
Good morning. I saw you come in.
We met last night? I'm Jordan.

297
00:24:39,067 --> 00:24:41,570
- I made you a sweater.
- Last night?

298
00:24:41,862 --> 00:24:44,865
It's something I do.
Hope the size is right.

299
00:24:45,157 --> 00:24:47,492
I used my brother
as a comparison.

300
00:24:47,784 --> 00:24:51,330
I went ahead and made you one,
because I was up.

301
00:24:51,622 --> 00:24:54,041
- Are you peeing?
- Yeah.

302
00:24:54,333 --> 00:24:57,628
I never sleep.
I drove my roommate nuts.

303
00:24:57,878 --> 00:25:03,050
She's okay, but she had to transfer.
I don't know if that's my fault.

304
00:25:03,342 --> 00:25:08,805
If you ever need to talk, let me know,
because I never sleep, okay?

305
00:25:09,097 --> 00:25:10,807
- I will.
- Are you done?

306
00:25:11,642 --> 00:25:14,019
- I can't start.
- Because I'm here?

307
00:25:14,311 --> 00:25:16,146
I think so.

308
00:25:16,438 --> 00:25:20,484
- Weird. Well, I have to go.
- Me too.

309
00:25:20,776 --> 00:25:22,778
Bye.

310
00:25:28,742 --> 00:25:31,328
Good morning!

311
00:25:42,548 --> 00:25:44,716
- Chris?
- Morning.

312
00:25:44,967 --> 00:25:48,345
You know, something strange
happened this morning.

313
00:25:48,595 --> 00:25:53,267
Was it a dream where you're standing
in a robe on a pyramid...

314
00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:57,855
...with 1000 naked women screaming
and throwing pickles at you?

315
00:25:58,146 --> 00:25:59,314
No.

316
00:25:59,606 --> 00:26:03,026
Why am I the only person
that has that dream?

317
00:26:07,489 --> 00:26:10,158
Is that liquid nitrogen?

318
00:26:10,701 --> 00:26:12,744
- Coffee?
- No.

319
00:26:18,792 --> 00:26:22,129
- What happened?
- There's a guy in our closet.

320
00:26:23,297 --> 00:26:25,299
You've seen him too?

321
00:26:25,632 --> 00:26:27,176
Who is he?

322
00:26:30,929 --> 00:26:31,930
Hollyfeld.

323
00:26:32,222 --> 00:26:34,808
- Why does he go in?
- Why do you go in?

324
00:26:35,058 --> 00:26:38,103
To get my clothes.
But that's not why he does.

325
00:26:38,395 --> 00:26:42,107
Of course not.
Your clothes would never fit him.

326
00:26:42,482 --> 00:26:44,526
Yeah.

327
00:26:45,194 --> 00:26:47,070
Think before you ask.

328
00:26:47,362 --> 00:26:52,242
Twenty points higher and thinks
a guy like that can wear his clothes.

329
00:30:14,111 --> 00:30:17,114
<i>plus y, equals zero.</i>

330
00:31:08,457 --> 00:31:10,417
This is it!

331
00:33:05,032 --> 00:33:07,492
Come on, get out of here! Get!

332
00:33:07,951 --> 00:33:10,537
- You wanted to see me?
- Mr. Knight.

333
00:33:10,787 --> 00:33:13,665
Right on time.
Unusual these days.

334
00:33:13,916 --> 00:33:17,211
- You still run?
- Only when chased.

335
00:33:17,711 --> 00:33:19,963
- What smells?
- Must be the dog.

336
00:33:20,255 --> 00:33:21,882
- That's popcorn.
- I know.

337
00:33:22,132 --> 00:33:26,428
Get it away from me. I hate popcorn.
Put it over there.

338
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,932
Now I know what to get you
for your birthday.

339
00:33:30,682 --> 00:33:34,102
I guess we're moving up
in the world, eh?

340
00:33:34,394 --> 00:33:37,231
- Very elegant.
- Try not to touch anything.

341
00:33:37,481 --> 00:33:41,193
- Is this okay, sir?
- It's oak, it's not plywood.

342
00:33:41,443 --> 00:33:44,947
- Quite a change from the old place.
- Shoes.

343
00:33:45,197 --> 00:33:47,699
I want to see
more of you in the lab.

344
00:33:47,991 --> 00:33:49,535
Fine. I'll gain weight.

345
00:33:49,785 --> 00:33:53,747
- You're very funny, Chris.
- Thanks, Jerry, we try.

346
00:33:56,041 --> 00:33:58,085
You can sit.

347
00:33:58,418 --> 00:34:02,464
When I brought you here,
I thought you'd be an Einstein.

348
00:34:02,756 --> 00:34:06,051
- You were on your way. Then?
- I got a haircut.

349
00:34:06,343 --> 00:34:09,012
- You're disappointing me.
- And you me.

350
00:34:09,304 --> 00:34:13,308
- Look, it's about our deal.
- I know, Jerry.

351
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,603
I've advanced your project
more than anyone.

352
00:34:16,895 --> 00:34:19,898
Yesterday. What have you done
for me today?

353
00:34:21,149 --> 00:34:23,735
Well, uh...

354
00:34:24,903 --> 00:34:28,323
I want five megawatts by mid-May.

355
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:36,331
I think you might be getting obsessive
about all this. I took in Mitch, okay?

356
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:40,460
He's coming along fine.
He's working his guts out.

357
00:34:40,752 --> 00:34:44,673
- So, what do you want?
- I want five megawatts by mid-May.

358
00:34:44,923 --> 00:34:49,803
Look, I don't care
if you're arrogant or disrespectful.

359
00:34:50,053 --> 00:34:53,390
But you're distracting Mitch.
That I won't have.

360
00:34:53,682 --> 00:34:57,728
The rules have changed.
I want it by mid-May.

361
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:03,817
Jerry, I think you're forgetting
one little detail. I'm out of here.

362
00:35:04,109 --> 00:35:06,486
I'm gone, I'm history.
I'm Casper.

363
00:35:06,778 --> 00:35:11,241
- I'm graduating.
- To graduate, you need my course.

364
00:35:11,491 --> 00:35:14,912
I have a say about
what you do and where you go.

365
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:19,041
So you and Mitch will spend
every moment in the lab.

366
00:35:19,333 --> 00:35:23,587
You will solve my power problem
by my deadline.

367
00:35:26,548 --> 00:35:32,346
If you think that threatening me
will make me your slave, you're right.

368
00:35:32,638 --> 00:35:35,891
But I'm only saying this
because I care.

369
00:35:36,183 --> 00:35:41,563
There are decaffeinated brands
that are as tasty as the real thing.

370
00:35:41,855 --> 00:35:44,441
I'm not kidding, Chris.

371
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:48,403
Neither am I, Jerry.

372
00:35:58,247 --> 00:35:59,331
Hi, Mitch.

373
00:36:00,457 --> 00:36:01,917
Do me a favour.

374
00:36:02,167 --> 00:36:06,129
Taste this.
Come on, you won't hurt my feelings.

375
00:36:06,755 --> 00:36:08,048
What, too sweet?

376
00:36:08,882 --> 00:36:12,678
- What is it?
- I don't know, it was in the lab.

377
00:36:13,637 --> 00:36:16,682
Relax, it's just yogurt.

378
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:22,354
- Mitch, are you all right?
- No, I'm not.

379
00:36:22,604 --> 00:36:27,651
This combination of cyanide is dumb.
This is the wrong direction.

380
00:36:27,943 --> 00:36:33,448
Only you know how to use this garbage.
And I'm getting brain-fried.

381
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:38,287
I'll make it up to you.
Let's just pause, put that down.

382
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:42,165
Let's just take a step back.

383
00:36:42,416 --> 00:36:44,668
No, take a step forward.

384
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:49,715
Now, take a step back.
And a step forward. Then step back.

385
00:36:50,382 --> 00:36:54,219
- Will you stop? I'm serious.
- Okay, I'm serious too.

386
00:36:54,469 --> 00:36:57,848
Let's charge it up.
Give me everything you got.

387
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:03,604
- I gotta connect the capacitors.
- Okay, this is work time.

388
00:37:11,153 --> 00:37:14,698
- How you doing?
- Fine. Don't rush me.

389
00:37:14,948 --> 00:37:19,286
Okay, just take your time.
Everything's fine.

390
00:37:21,205 --> 00:37:23,749
What is taking so long?

391
00:37:24,124 --> 00:37:26,585
I'm coming.

392
00:37:28,086 --> 00:37:29,379
Charging.

393
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:31,381
Shades.

394
00:37:38,722 --> 00:37:41,183
- What are you doing?
- Waiting.

395
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:47,272
It's just the fuse.
It'll be back on in a minute.

396
00:37:47,564 --> 00:37:51,193
I shouldn't have used
the building transformer.

397
00:37:51,401 --> 00:37:55,364
But, more importantly,
did we get a charge?

398
00:37:57,533 --> 00:37:58,742
What'd you do?

399
00:37:59,243 --> 00:38:01,078
- Wait!
- Come on, Sputnik.

400
00:38:01,286 --> 00:38:04,289
You wanted help,
so here we go.

401
00:38:04,957 --> 00:38:07,960
- Beautiful minds.
- We have work.

402
00:38:08,252 --> 00:38:10,796
We're going to work.
Hard work.

403
00:38:11,046 --> 00:38:13,298
This must've taken hours.

404
00:38:13,549 --> 00:38:14,883
Let's find out.

405
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,391
I told you they'd come back on.

406
00:38:22,683 --> 00:38:26,019
- What's this?
- It's a laser beam, bozo.

407
00:38:26,311 --> 00:38:29,356
- What's it for?
- Not what. Where.

408
00:38:29,606 --> 00:38:33,527
- What?
- Follow it. It's a surprise.

409
00:38:36,697 --> 00:38:38,657
Like it?

410
00:38:39,491 --> 00:38:42,578
Hey, what's the beam splitter for?

411
00:38:43,537 --> 00:38:48,208
What's the matter?
Need everything spelled out for you?

412
00:38:52,045 --> 00:38:54,173
Come on, let's tan!

413
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,218
One for Mitch.

414
00:39:10,564 --> 00:39:13,817
Come on in,
the South Pacific calls you.

415
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:18,280
- Who're the girls?
- Not from around here.

416
00:39:19,281 --> 00:39:21,825
- They're from a nearby college.
- Where?

417
00:39:22,117 --> 00:39:24,578
The Wanda Trossler Beauty School.

418
00:39:25,245 --> 00:39:27,581
- They're beauticians?
- Not yet.

419
00:39:27,831 --> 00:39:31,835
- I don't know.
- Your genius might impress them.

420
00:39:32,044 --> 00:39:34,046
I don't see how.

421
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,174
Given the type of guys you are...

422
00:39:37,466 --> 00:39:43,430
...this may be your only chance
in your entire lives...

423
00:39:43,722 --> 00:39:45,724
...to have sex.

424
00:39:45,974 --> 00:39:48,101
Think about it.

425
00:40:17,506 --> 00:40:20,050
Destiny!
I've got her now.

426
00:40:25,722 --> 00:40:30,352
Don't you know that eating that
can give you large breasts?

427
00:40:30,644 --> 00:40:33,230
Oh, my God.
I'm too late.

428
00:40:46,368 --> 00:40:49,538
Don't think I don't
want my invention to work.

429
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:53,959
- The day's only so long.
- Ready to go.

430
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:57,546
Pushing me doesn't help.
Tell them that.

431
00:40:57,838 --> 00:41:02,050
Start showing results
or they'll find somebody else.

432
00:41:02,342 --> 00:41:05,596
- Oh, really?
- You won't have your big toys.

433
00:41:05,846 --> 00:41:09,600
I'm the best.
Do you know who you're dealing with?

434
00:41:10,225 --> 00:41:13,061
How dare you try this.
I have to go on.

435
00:41:13,312 --> 00:41:16,857
This conversation is in
incredibly poor taste.

436
00:41:17,149 --> 00:41:19,902
- Son of a bitch.
- Asshole.

437
00:41:22,905 --> 00:41:26,658
<i>Welcome to Everything,
with Jerome Hathaway.</i>

438
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:31,872
<i>Funded by a grant from
Darlington E lectronic Instruments.</i>

439
00:41:32,122 --> 00:41:36,043
<i>Hi, I'm Jerry Hathaway,
with Everything.</i>

440
00:41:36,335 --> 00:41:42,382
Tonight, we'll look at something
that most of us take for granted.

441
00:41:42,925 --> 00:41:46,720
The colon.
What does it look like?

442
00:41:47,554 --> 00:41:48,847
Get out of there.

443
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:51,850
- Kent!
- Cut!

444
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:56,730
- You're in front of the teleprompter.
- Well, I didn't know.

445
00:41:57,397 --> 00:42:00,234
- We need to talk.
- Get my laundry?

446
00:42:00,526 --> 00:42:03,111
- Yes, but there's more.
- The gravy.

447
00:42:03,403 --> 00:42:07,616
No, that came out.
Chris and Mitch, they're at a party.

448
00:42:07,866 --> 00:42:09,910
With girls.

449
00:42:11,787 --> 00:42:14,873
- I want you to show me.
- My pleasure.

450
00:42:53,787 --> 00:42:57,624
- Hi, are you busy?
- Yes. No.

451
00:42:57,875 --> 00:43:01,837
Wanna help test my rebreather?
Come on!

452
00:43:02,129 --> 00:43:03,589
Sure!

453
00:43:09,303 --> 00:43:13,056
It's a simple principle.
It's basically a filter.

454
00:43:13,348 --> 00:43:17,769
It lets CO2 out and O2 back in,
but no bubbles.

455
00:43:19,229 --> 00:43:22,983
- How come you're not...?
- Necking? I'm not gay!

456
00:43:23,442 --> 00:43:24,735
No, partying.

457
00:43:25,569 --> 00:43:29,948
Because I'm 19 and I'm brilliant
and hyperkinetic.

458
00:43:30,199 --> 00:43:33,118
Guys are afraid.
I guess I should be upset.

459
00:43:35,204 --> 00:43:37,915
I think you're very nice.

460
00:43:40,417 --> 00:43:43,086
I think you're nice too.

461
00:43:47,132 --> 00:43:49,468
Do you want to try this?

462
00:43:55,724 --> 00:43:59,394
- It's lighter in the water.
- How about you?

463
00:44:11,698 --> 00:44:12,991
Taylor!

464
00:44:19,623 --> 00:44:22,584
- Why aren't you in the lab?
- I just...

465
00:44:22,835 --> 00:44:25,546
You're here to work,
not to play doctor.

466
00:44:25,796 --> 00:44:28,507
- I got delayed.
- Where's Knight?

467
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:31,760
- You both make me sick.
- Kent!

468
00:44:33,887 --> 00:44:39,184
I took a chance recommending you.
I can see I made a mistake.

469
00:44:39,434 --> 00:44:41,979
I hope you're proud of yourself.

470
00:44:48,151 --> 00:44:50,320
- Dr. Hathaway?
- What?

471
00:44:50,863 --> 00:44:52,948
Are you wearing makeup?

472
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:56,368
What?

473
00:45:28,317 --> 00:45:33,322
I need one more course
to complete my humanities credits.

474
00:45:45,834 --> 00:45:50,172
I'd like to make a collect call
to Mrs. Bill Taylor.

475
00:45:50,756 --> 00:45:53,342
- Come on, come on.
- Mitch Taylor.

476
00:45:54,384 --> 00:45:56,970
I got a great idea.

477
00:45:57,262 --> 00:45:58,764
- What?
- Hold it down!

478
00:45:59,014 --> 00:46:00,641
Mom, I...

479
00:46:04,853 --> 00:46:07,314
I want to come home.

480
00:46:15,197 --> 00:46:18,617
<i>- Are you there?
- Baby, you sound upset.</i>

481
00:46:19,076 --> 00:46:22,663
I don't like it here.
I wanna come home.

482
00:46:23,705 --> 00:46:26,458
You rented out my room?!
To who?

483
00:46:26,708 --> 00:46:29,670
<i>Mr. Echevarria, the plumber.</i>

484
00:46:42,474 --> 00:46:48,188
- Where were you last night?
- The lab, where you should've been.

485
00:46:51,191 --> 00:46:56,154
Jordan said that Hathaway was mad.
What exactly did he...?

486
00:46:58,282 --> 00:47:01,785
Let me hold that thought
and get back to you.

487
00:47:08,166 --> 00:47:11,545
<i>- Are you there?
- Baby, you sound upset.</i>

488
00:47:11,795 --> 00:47:15,090
<i>I don't like it here.
I wanna come home.</i>

489
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:18,302
<i>It's not for you to like,
it's for you to do.</i>

490
00:47:18,552 --> 00:47:22,431
<i>- You're 15 years old.
- I wanna come home.</i>

491
00:47:22,723 --> 00:47:26,602
<i>- You want to live with me and Daddy?
- Yeah.</i>

492
00:47:27,269 --> 00:47:31,607
<i>- I'll go back to high school.
- We've rented out your room.</i>

493
00:47:32,733 --> 00:47:35,777
<i>- Mom, to who?
- Mr. Echevarria, the plumber.</i>

494
00:47:36,069 --> 00:47:39,489
<i>We can share it.
I don't wanna stay here.</i>

495
00:47:40,616 --> 00:47:46,121
<i>- That doesn't sound like my soldier.
- Mitch, this is your dad.</i>

496
00:47:47,623 --> 00:47:50,584
<i>- Hi, Dad.
- Are you crying?</i>

497
00:47:50,834 --> 00:47:53,295
<i>- I'm sorry.
- I hope nobody sees.</i>

498
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:58,091
<i>- I'm a kid.
- You've never been just a kid.</i>

499
00:48:21,615 --> 00:48:25,869
If you wanna leave, go ahead.

500
00:48:26,537 --> 00:48:30,249
But you're gonna miss the fun.

501
00:48:30,499 --> 00:48:31,834
What fun?

502
00:48:32,084 --> 00:48:35,712
Ick's releasing a new virus
in Kent's room.

503
00:48:35,963 --> 00:48:40,592
- The other night I needed your help.
- I helped you relax.

504
00:48:40,884 --> 00:48:44,179
Being snubbed by beauticians
is not relaxing.

505
00:48:44,429 --> 00:48:46,849
Student beauticians.

506
00:48:47,975 --> 00:48:52,396
I thought this place was different.
But it's the same.

507
00:48:52,688 --> 00:48:55,524
In high school,
I got put in a mailbox.

508
00:48:55,774 --> 00:48:58,527
Teachers hated me
because I was smarter.

509
00:48:58,777 --> 00:49:02,489
Students hated me because
I blew the bell curve.

510
00:49:02,781 --> 00:49:04,408
I was just like you.

511
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:08,745
I had white shirts and Hush Puppies
and a briefcase.

512
00:49:08,996 --> 00:49:10,956
Girls never talked to me.

513
00:49:11,248 --> 00:49:15,085
When I got here, for
three years I studied constantly.

514
00:49:16,461 --> 00:49:18,380
- You?
- Yeah.

515
00:49:18,881 --> 00:49:22,843
One night, sitting right here,
I had a vision.

516
00:49:23,177 --> 00:49:25,470
- What?
- Hollyfeld.

517
00:49:26,138 --> 00:49:30,142
- The guy in the closet?
- Lazlo Hollyfeld.

518
00:49:30,392 --> 00:49:34,396
I followed him into the closet,
down into the tunnels.

519
00:49:34,646 --> 00:49:38,567
There I saw the most disgusting thing
I've ever seen.

520
00:49:38,817 --> 00:49:40,986
- What?
- Lazlo in his pajamas.

521
00:49:42,613 --> 00:49:45,282
- So?
- So I talked to him.

522
00:49:45,532 --> 00:49:46,950
- You did?
- Yeah.

523
00:49:47,242 --> 00:49:52,456
He was a stud around here in the '70s.
Smarter than us put together.

524
00:49:53,457 --> 00:49:55,876
What happened?
Did he crack?

525
00:49:56,168 --> 00:49:58,003
He cracked, severely.

526
00:49:58,295 --> 00:50:01,507
- Why?
- He loved his work.

527
00:50:01,965 --> 00:50:05,677
- What's wrong with that?
- That's all he did.

528
00:50:05,928 --> 00:50:09,264
He loved problems,
he loved the answers.

529
00:50:09,556 --> 00:50:14,728
But he thought that the answers
were the answers for everything.

530
00:50:15,270 --> 00:50:17,356
All science,
no philosophy.

531
00:50:17,648 --> 00:50:22,778
One day, someone told him
the stuff he made was killing people.

532
00:50:24,321 --> 00:50:27,282
So, what?
I'm gonna end up in a tunnel?

533
00:50:27,991 --> 00:50:29,826
- Yeah.
- What?

534
00:50:30,077 --> 00:50:33,080
You are,
if you keep up like this.

535
00:50:33,372 --> 00:50:35,499
You don't need to run away.

536
00:50:35,791 --> 00:50:39,086
When you're smart,
people need you.

537
00:50:39,378 --> 00:50:42,756
You can use your mind creatively.

538
00:50:43,423 --> 00:50:46,593
- I noticed you don't study hard.
- Bingo.

539
00:50:51,098 --> 00:50:55,018
Yeah, but if I stay,
what should I do?

540
00:50:55,310 --> 00:50:59,606
First, get even with Kent.
It's a moral imperative.

541
00:51:02,901 --> 00:51:04,236
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

542
00:51:07,197 --> 00:51:08,699
Now, you try it.

543
00:51:11,410 --> 00:51:14,580
- Now, let's unpack.
- Right.

544
00:51:35,350 --> 00:51:38,520
That's what makes Darlington
so sweet.

545
00:51:38,812 --> 00:51:42,441
- But Knight's got it locked.
- Maybe, maybe not.

546
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:51,700
Come on, you guys.
He's gone.

547
00:52:00,083 --> 00:52:03,504
- Kent's name is on his plates.
- Like my underwear.

548
00:52:03,795 --> 00:52:07,466
You have license plates
in your underwear?

549
00:52:22,898 --> 00:52:24,441
Hey, Kent.

550
00:52:25,734 --> 00:52:27,319
That's your car.

551
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:32,699
- You're not supposed to park on campus.
- This isn't funny.

552
00:52:33,325 --> 00:52:36,703
- You've gone too far.
- I had help.

553
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:39,873
You, huh?

554
00:52:40,541 --> 00:52:45,796
Dr. Hathaway's gonna hear about this.
You'll rue the day!

555
00:52:46,046 --> 00:52:50,133
"Rue the day"?
Who talks like that?

556
00:53:01,353 --> 00:53:03,522
Wow. Hello.

557
00:53:04,273 --> 00:53:06,066
Hi.

558
00:53:14,032 --> 00:53:17,119
Jerry asked me to drop by.
What about you?

559
00:53:17,369 --> 00:53:20,873
- What?
- Which word didn't you understand?

560
00:53:21,164 --> 00:53:23,166
- You here for the meeting?
- Meeting?

561
00:53:23,458 --> 00:53:26,170
- I don't know.
- Okay.

562
00:53:27,045 --> 00:53:30,299
- Look, I'm just waiting.
- Great.

563
00:53:30,674 --> 00:53:34,261
If you can't do it,
we'll get somebody else.

564
00:53:34,553 --> 00:53:39,099
- I have a timetable.
- We're close, everything'll be fine.

565
00:53:39,391 --> 00:53:42,769
Remember, you work for me.
I've made my point.

566
00:53:43,061 --> 00:53:46,732
- Crystal clear.
- Anything I should know about?

567
00:53:46,982 --> 00:53:51,486
- I'll be with you in a moment.
- Goodbye, Jerry. Susan.

568
00:53:51,737 --> 00:53:58,368
I guess this is goodbye. I'm sorry
I didn't get a chance to know you.

569
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:03,540
Have you ever
seen a body like this before?

570
00:54:03,832 --> 00:54:07,794
- She's my daughter.
- Well, then I guess you have.

571
00:54:08,295 --> 00:54:10,714
- Coming, Don?
- Yeah.

572
00:54:12,508 --> 00:54:16,720
If there's ever anything
I can do for you...

573
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:19,806
...or to you,
you let me know.

574
00:54:20,724 --> 00:54:24,353
- Can you hammer a nail with your penis?
- Not now.

575
00:54:24,811 --> 00:54:28,315
A girl's gotta have her standards.

576
00:54:31,485 --> 00:54:33,862
- Smart girl.
- What're you doing?

577
00:54:34,154 --> 00:54:36,949
- You said come over.
- Stay off the rug.

578
00:54:39,159 --> 00:54:40,744
Take off your shoes.

579
00:54:40,994 --> 00:54:43,163
- What's up, doc?
- Sit down.

580
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:46,416
- Who were they?
- You're of no use to me!

581
00:54:46,708 --> 00:54:50,504
- Interesting way to start.
- I'm giving Kent the job.

582
00:54:50,754 --> 00:54:54,049
- You gave me the job.
- You need a degree.

583
00:54:54,299 --> 00:54:58,303
- I'll pass your exam.
- Even if you pass, you don't pass.

584
00:54:58,595 --> 00:55:03,934
- Why don't you leave right now?
- I'll go to Dr. Meredith.

585
00:55:04,184 --> 00:55:10,148
- The work I've done merits a degree.
- Who will he believe, you or me?

586
00:55:12,025 --> 00:55:16,113
- You can't do this.
- It's done. Now get out!

587
00:55:16,363 --> 00:55:18,949
You'll never work in this field.

588
00:55:19,241 --> 00:55:22,536
- You unbelievable bastard.
- Count on it.

589
00:55:47,686 --> 00:55:49,479
What're you doing?

590
00:55:52,983 --> 00:55:59,198
I was thinking of the immortal
words of Socrates, who said:

591
00:55:59,823 --> 00:56:01,783
"I drank what?"

592
00:56:02,201 --> 00:56:04,244
Is there something wrong?

593
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:08,582
Hathaway is going
to flunk me out of school.

594
00:56:09,416 --> 00:56:11,835
- Why?
- I screwed up.

595
00:56:14,171 --> 00:56:17,049
- What are you gonna do?
- I'll leave.

596
00:56:17,299 --> 00:56:19,760
You can't!
You'll be a failure!

597
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,138
Thank you, Mitch.

598
00:56:28,644 --> 00:56:31,980
You just can't leave.
You owe me ten bucks.

599
00:56:37,236 --> 00:56:38,612
You can't quit.

600
00:56:39,446 --> 00:56:44,660
If for no other reason than
to see a five-megawatt laser fire.

601
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:47,037
That would be nice.

602
00:56:49,122 --> 00:56:52,334
- Finish what you start.
- Who said that?

603
00:56:52,626 --> 00:56:54,378
You know that.

604
00:56:55,170 --> 00:57:00,133
That's right, Mitch.
But that's no way to motivate someone.

605
00:57:02,845 --> 00:57:05,514
You've got to get even
with Hathaway.

606
00:57:05,806 --> 00:57:07,766
It's a moral imperative.

607
00:57:10,477 --> 00:57:12,855
That's a good point.

608
01:00:29,968 --> 01:00:31,762
Vito, not again.

609
01:00:42,898 --> 01:00:45,567
Why don't you get some sleep.

610
01:00:45,817 --> 01:00:51,073
It's not like we're driving or
anything. You're still a growing boy.

611
01:00:54,743 --> 01:00:57,454
Hey, Lazlo.

612
01:00:59,164 --> 01:01:00,791
Lazlo?

613
01:01:03,210 --> 01:01:05,879
That's me.
Hello.

614
01:01:07,673 --> 01:01:09,883
I've been watching you.

615
01:01:11,844 --> 01:01:13,470
Thanks.

616
01:01:14,972 --> 01:01:21,186
I thought I'd help, so I found
every question Hathaway's asked...

617
01:01:21,645 --> 01:01:23,856
...on every final he's given.

618
01:01:24,106 --> 01:01:26,900
Gee, I didn't get you anything.

619
01:01:27,234 --> 01:01:28,652
Are those they?

620
01:01:30,988 --> 01:01:32,406
No.

621
01:01:32,656 --> 01:01:35,450
These are sweepstakes entries.

622
01:01:35,742 --> 01:01:38,704
Enter as often as you want,
so I am.

623
01:01:38,954 --> 01:01:41,832
That's great!
How many times?

624
01:01:42,249 --> 01:01:47,421
Well, this batch makes it 1,650,000.

625
01:01:47,671 --> 01:01:51,383
I should win 32.6% of the prizes,
plus the car.

626
01:01:51,633 --> 01:01:54,970
That takes the fun out of it,
doesn't it?

627
01:01:55,262 --> 01:02:00,767
They set up the rules, and I realized
I have certain materialistic needs.

628
01:02:01,476 --> 01:02:02,769
So...

629
01:02:03,812 --> 01:02:05,814
Where are the questions?

630
01:02:06,815 --> 01:02:08,901
I memorized them.

631
01:02:09,193 --> 01:02:10,444
Sure.

632
01:02:16,283 --> 01:02:18,994
I gotta go to sleep.

633
01:02:19,328 --> 01:02:21,747
Did you wanna borrow my pajamas?

634
01:02:22,039 --> 01:02:25,209
No, thanks.

635
01:02:27,377 --> 01:02:30,714
- Hey, he's a pretty smart kid.
- Yeah.

636
01:02:31,673 --> 01:02:34,468
He'll grow five inches
in the next year.

637
01:02:40,891 --> 01:02:43,560
- Mitch?
- Jordan?

638
01:02:47,606 --> 01:02:49,775
Mitch Taylor?

639
01:02:51,109 --> 01:02:52,361
Who...

640
01:02:52,653 --> 01:02:57,491
My name is Sherry Nugil.
I've waited three years for this.

641
01:02:57,783 --> 01:03:00,827
- For what?
- For you to be old enough.

642
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:04,748
- For what?
- For this.

643
01:03:17,511 --> 01:03:19,054
Come in!

644
01:03:21,723 --> 01:03:25,227
Hi, Mitch!
I'm just sanding my floor!

645
01:03:26,270 --> 01:03:29,356
Could you turn that off a second?!

646
01:03:32,526 --> 01:03:34,820
How come you're so sweaty?

647
01:03:35,112 --> 01:03:39,324
I came back from helping Chris,
and a woman was in my room.

648
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:46,206
- Pardon?
- A woman. You know, she was an adult.

649
01:03:47,666 --> 01:03:51,378
Well, she wanted to...

650
01:03:51,712 --> 01:03:54,089
- How can I say this?
- Jump you?

651
01:03:55,382 --> 01:03:57,259
- Yeah.
- You made it?

652
01:03:58,093 --> 01:04:01,805
- No. That's what was unbelievable.
- Pardon?

653
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:06,768
I stopped her.
I told her I didn't want to.

654
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:08,979
Why?

655
01:04:09,730 --> 01:04:12,566
Because I really did want to.

656
01:04:16,195 --> 01:04:19,698
I wanted to,
but not with her.

657
01:04:22,492 --> 01:04:23,827
Oh.

658
01:04:40,177 --> 01:04:42,721
- This is my class hour!
- It's May 10th.

659
01:04:43,013 --> 01:04:47,976
- What are you doing here?
- Me?! What are you doing here?

660
01:04:48,268 --> 01:04:51,396
Decker is dangerous!
Where's the laser?

661
01:04:51,688 --> 01:04:54,358
- Coming.
- It's not even breathing hard.

662
01:04:54,608 --> 01:04:57,194
He wants it
by the end of the week!

663
01:04:57,444 --> 01:05:00,447
Now you listen to me!
You grovelling bug!

664
01:05:00,739 --> 01:05:04,826
I have exams! I'm doing what I can,
so get off my back!

665
01:05:06,286 --> 01:05:11,291
That should just about do the trick,
as long as you stay cool.

666
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,920
- Let's go, girls.
- What does that mean?

667
01:05:15,170 --> 01:05:19,424
It's a figure of speech.
You guys coming to the exam?

668
01:05:19,716 --> 01:05:24,388
I guess, since Hathaway's
gone to the trouble of having one.

669
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:26,890
You coming, buddy boy?

670
01:05:27,432 --> 01:05:30,352
I'll catch up.
I gotta go to the bathroom.

671
01:05:30,602 --> 01:05:35,190
I don't think that's gonna
help your confidence any, do you?

672
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:42,322
Buddy boy.

673
01:05:46,243 --> 01:05:49,913
Let's see how funny you think this is.

674
01:05:54,668 --> 01:05:56,378
Buddy boy.

675
01:06:05,971 --> 01:06:07,931
All right, we...

676
01:06:13,145 --> 01:06:15,480
We have exactly three hours.

677
01:06:15,772 --> 01:06:19,109
And remember,
we believe in the honour system.

678
01:06:19,526 --> 01:06:25,324
It'll be apparent how many of you
haven't absorbed this material.

679
01:06:25,616 --> 01:06:28,368
Take one,
like your IQ was normal.

680
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:30,579
Good luck, buddy boy.

681
01:06:30,829 --> 01:06:36,835
Can I name my first child after you?
"Dipshit Knight" has a nice ring.

682
01:08:10,929 --> 01:08:12,222
No. No!

683
01:08:13,473 --> 01:08:14,850
No!

684
01:08:28,989 --> 01:08:31,992
My condolences on your meltdown.

685
01:08:33,202 --> 01:08:35,287
What meltdown, Kent?

686
01:08:36,872 --> 01:08:41,585
I'm not saying that you had one,
because how would I know?

687
01:08:41,877 --> 01:08:44,004
But just in case you do.

688
01:08:44,463 --> 01:08:47,257
- You slime.
- It's your own fault.

689
01:08:47,633 --> 01:08:52,721
Didn't anyone ever tell you
to make sure your optics are clean?

690
01:09:32,010 --> 01:09:35,597
I can do it!
How does it feel to be frozen?!

691
01:09:35,889 --> 01:09:38,183
Ice is nice!

692
01:09:38,433 --> 01:09:41,895
- Lazlo, buddy! Seen Mitch?
- No.

693
01:09:42,813 --> 01:09:44,398
He's not in there.

694
01:09:44,648 --> 01:09:48,235
- How'd you do?
- I passed! But I failed!

695
01:09:48,485 --> 01:09:51,822
Well, then I'm happy and sad for you.

696
01:09:52,072 --> 01:09:54,408
Gotta find Mitch.
Mitch!

697
01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:56,660
He's not in the toilet.

698
01:09:56,952 --> 01:10:01,039
I'll freeze it and get
at least an order of magnitude.

699
01:10:01,290 --> 01:10:05,294
Because it's gonna be frozen.
I think I can do it.

700
01:10:05,544 --> 01:10:06,795
Bye!

701
01:10:07,087 --> 01:10:09,590
Hey, man!
You're not Mitch.

702
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:14,678
Hey, Lazlo!
Wanna see a demonstration of gravity?

703
01:10:14,928 --> 01:10:19,808
It can be done!
That's a window! That's a door!

704
01:10:22,728 --> 01:10:25,272
Mitch!
Where's your math!?

705
01:10:26,732 --> 01:10:28,150
Hey, you jerk!

706
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:31,486
I'm very sorry.
I'll buy you a car.

707
01:10:31,778 --> 01:10:34,531
I don't have one.
It's my dad's.

708
01:10:52,674 --> 01:10:55,093
How's it going, Jerry?

709
01:10:55,427 --> 01:10:56,762
What do you want?

710
01:10:57,054 --> 01:11:00,140
World peace,
but this isn't the time.

711
01:11:00,432 --> 01:11:03,560
- Get out!
- This might interest you.

712
01:11:03,810 --> 01:11:06,480
- I'm not interested.
- Dr. Hathaway...

713
01:11:06,730 --> 01:11:09,191
Susan.

714
01:11:15,948 --> 01:11:18,534
I solved the power problem, Jerry.

715
01:11:21,119 --> 01:11:24,081
- Jerry?
- Take a cab.

716
01:11:25,415 --> 01:11:28,126
So you'll hammer later.

717
01:11:33,924 --> 01:11:37,052
We were working
on the cyanide system.

718
01:11:37,344 --> 01:11:41,265
Well, earlier today,
it ate itself.

719
01:11:41,557 --> 01:11:46,061
But that's just what we needed
to take a giant step forward.

720
01:11:46,353 --> 01:11:47,855
Right, Kent?

721
01:11:48,772 --> 01:11:52,192
Needless to say,
I was despondent about the meltdown.

722
01:11:52,442 --> 01:11:56,071
In the midst of my preparations
for hari-kari...

723
01:11:56,321 --> 01:11:58,198
...it came to me.

724
01:11:58,407 --> 01:12:02,744
It's possible to synthesize
bromide in an argon matrix.

725
01:12:02,995 --> 01:12:08,000
- Excimers, frozen in an excited state.
- That's impossible.

726
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:11,670
It's a chemical laser,
but solid, not gaseous.

727
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:16,800
Put simply, in deference to Kent,
it's like lasing dynamite.

728
01:12:17,050 --> 01:12:22,556
We couple it to a state that is
radiatively coupled to the ground.

729
01:12:23,098 --> 01:12:27,936
Extracting 10-to-the-21 st
protons per cubic centimetre...

730
01:12:28,228 --> 01:12:33,942
...will give 1 kilojoule per cubic
centimetre, or a megajoule per litre.

731
01:12:34,193 --> 01:12:35,485
Hotter than the sun.

732
01:12:35,736 --> 01:12:37,946
- It's small.
- It's meant to be.

733
01:12:38,155 --> 01:12:40,741
We only have the one sample...

734
01:12:41,033 --> 01:12:45,495
...and it's going to destroy itself
as it lases.

735
01:12:48,248 --> 01:12:50,501
But everything will be fine.

736
01:12:51,585 --> 01:12:52,920
- Right, Mitch?
- Yeah.

737
01:12:53,212 --> 01:12:55,589
This is a complete waste of time.

738
01:12:55,797 --> 01:12:59,718
Kent, put the target
in front of the cinder blocks.

739
01:13:08,477 --> 01:13:10,938
Okay, come behind the shield.

740
01:13:19,613 --> 01:13:23,992
Okay, Mr. Taylor.
Any time you're ready.

741
01:13:26,370 --> 01:13:30,541
Ready? Laser on!

742
01:13:36,922 --> 01:13:38,882
All right!

743
01:13:41,677 --> 01:13:43,220
Look at this!

744
01:13:47,850 --> 01:13:49,518
Wow!

745
01:13:52,187 --> 01:13:56,692
- Sorry about the window.
- And the trees across the quad!

746
01:14:00,487 --> 01:14:01,947
You did it.

747
01:14:02,197 --> 01:14:03,532
I did my part too.

748
01:14:04,116 --> 01:14:06,493
You graduate.
You get the job.

749
01:14:06,994 --> 01:14:10,914
What? You can't!
That's my job.

750
01:14:11,206 --> 01:14:14,751
I've done everything
you've ever asked me to.

751
01:14:16,628 --> 01:14:19,256
I teach your classes for you!

752
01:14:19,506 --> 01:14:22,676
- I get your laundry!
- What is he doing?

753
01:14:24,178 --> 01:14:28,640
I mounted the optics
for the target-tracking system.

754
01:14:29,725 --> 01:14:32,060
Look!

755
01:14:34,354 --> 01:14:36,982
Wait. Wait.

756
01:14:37,274 --> 01:14:40,277
- Let's celebrate!
- Absolutely.

757
01:14:42,237 --> 01:14:45,782
You see anything unusual
on the campus?

758
01:14:49,203 --> 01:14:52,289
- My glasses!
- Well, try not to wobble.

759
01:14:52,873 --> 01:14:56,585
- There is a complete hole.
- That's great.

760
01:14:56,793 --> 01:14:58,420
Look.

761
01:15:11,767 --> 01:15:13,185
Let's get a burger.

762
01:15:13,435 --> 01:15:15,812
- Let's go!
- In there?

763
01:15:24,154 --> 01:15:25,781
This place is wild.

764
01:15:27,658 --> 01:15:31,787
- Do you see that?
- Like her? She's from Playa del Rey.

765
01:15:32,037 --> 01:15:34,790
- Am I gonna meet your parents?
- No.

766
01:15:35,082 --> 01:15:39,795
- Why? Are you ashamed of me?
- No, them.

767
01:15:40,254 --> 01:15:43,423
Remember the right people
to thank on this.

768
01:15:43,674 --> 01:15:46,009
- I'd like to thank my fish.
- What?!

769
01:15:46,260 --> 01:15:49,179
- And Mr. Ikagami!
- I love it.

770
01:15:54,434 --> 01:15:55,894
What are you saying?

771
01:15:56,478 --> 01:15:57,896
Lazlo!

772
01:16:07,906 --> 01:16:10,951
I'm glad you came out.
Want a hamburger?

773
01:16:11,243 --> 01:16:14,788
I've been thinking about
your laser solution.

774
01:16:15,038 --> 01:16:20,794
- You've increased it to 6 megawatts.
- Yeah, about that.

775
01:16:21,211 --> 01:16:24,798
- What would you use it for?
- Enormous Swiss cheese?

776
01:16:25,841 --> 01:16:27,217
It can do anything.

777
01:16:27,426 --> 01:16:31,805
No. The beam would last for what,
15 seconds?

778
01:16:32,222 --> 01:16:36,727
- What good is that?
- I respect you, but I graduated.

779
01:16:37,019 --> 01:16:40,230
Let the engineers figure that out.

780
01:16:40,522 --> 01:16:42,816
Maybe it already has a use...

781
01:16:43,066 --> 01:16:45,694
...for which it's designed.

782
01:16:45,986 --> 01:16:48,280
Hathaway has something in mind?

783
01:16:48,530 --> 01:16:52,242
Look at the facts.
Very high power, portable...

784
01:16:52,451 --> 01:16:56,288
...limited firing time,
unlimited range.

785
01:16:56,538 --> 01:16:59,458
With a tracking system
and a mirror...

786
01:16:59,708 --> 01:17:02,461
...you could vaporize
a human from space.

787
01:17:05,172 --> 01:17:07,424
This is not good.

788
01:17:15,098 --> 01:17:16,475
No!

789
01:17:16,850 --> 01:17:18,894
What happened?

790
01:17:22,564 --> 01:17:24,358
Oh, no.

791
01:17:25,817 --> 01:17:27,945
- Chris.
- I'm all right.

792
01:17:33,158 --> 01:17:37,746
- They took everything.
- Kent's tracking system is gone!

793
01:17:39,289 --> 01:17:42,084
How could you build that mirror?!

794
01:17:50,801 --> 01:17:53,095
He lied to us.

795
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:56,765
It's easy to lie to you, Mitch.

796
01:17:57,641 --> 01:17:58,851
You trust people.

797
01:17:59,685 --> 01:18:01,979
I'm a cynic.

798
01:18:03,939 --> 01:18:05,816
I'm such an asshole.

799
01:18:07,067 --> 01:18:10,153
I understand how you feel.
You're right.

800
01:18:10,404 --> 01:18:13,782
But we need to find out
what he's doing.

801
01:18:14,074 --> 01:18:15,576
Kent.

802
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:24,334
Shh, you guys!

803
01:18:44,521 --> 01:18:47,399
- We'll have two minutes.
- Pardon?

804
01:18:53,822 --> 01:18:55,699
- Hi.
- Hi.

805
01:19:15,010 --> 01:19:17,346
Okay, open his mouth.

806
01:19:19,097 --> 01:19:21,141
Bulldogs.

807
01:19:22,559 --> 01:19:24,603
And transceiver.

808
01:19:24,895 --> 01:19:26,897
And tweezers.

809
01:19:29,066 --> 01:19:31,735
The braces gave me the idea.

810
01:19:31,985 --> 01:19:35,030
Perfect antennae.
His head becomes a speaker.

811
01:19:35,322 --> 01:19:38,700
It's about time someone
put it to good use.

812
01:19:45,415 --> 01:19:47,334
Kent?

813
01:19:47,918 --> 01:19:51,964
<i>Kent.
Wake up, Kent.</i>

814
01:19:55,217 --> 01:19:56,510
<i>- Kent.
- What?</i>

815
01:19:56,802 --> 01:20:00,097
<i>I'm talking to you, Kent.</i>

816
01:20:00,681 --> 01:20:04,434
<i>- What is this?
- I said, I'm talking to you.</i>

817
01:20:04,726 --> 01:20:07,312
- No.
- Yeah.

818
01:20:08,814 --> 01:20:11,316
Well, I'm not asleep.

819
01:20:12,234 --> 01:20:16,280
<i>- I must be overworked.
- You're not overworked, Kent.</i>

820
01:20:16,530 --> 01:20:18,866
Well, I'm not insane!

821
01:20:20,993 --> 01:20:23,787
<i>- Or am I?
- That remains to be seen, Kent.</i>

822
01:20:24,079 --> 01:20:27,499
But we are having a conversation.

823
01:20:31,170 --> 01:20:34,756
<i>- Okay, who is this?
- This is Jesus, Kent.</i>

824
01:20:35,007 --> 01:20:39,303
And you've been a very naughty boy!

825
01:20:40,721 --> 01:20:43,932
All right, who is this?

826
01:20:44,183 --> 01:20:47,394
- Cut the crap. You built a weapon.
- What?

827
01:20:47,686 --> 01:20:53,192
What do you think a secret phase
conjugate tracking system is for?

828
01:20:53,442 --> 01:20:56,445
<i>A big mirror makes a big beam.</i>

829
01:21:00,574 --> 01:21:02,576
I guess it could be.

830
01:21:02,826 --> 01:21:05,579
Where's the laser now?

831
01:21:05,871 --> 01:21:12,127
I overheard Jerry mention something
about a test on the 27th.

832
01:21:12,544 --> 01:21:15,422
<i>But I don't know where.
It's classified.</i>

833
01:21:18,342 --> 01:21:21,762
- What?
- Oh, nothing.

834
01:21:22,012 --> 01:21:26,350
I want you to think about
what you've done, Kent.

835
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:27,768
And from now on...

836
01:21:28,018 --> 01:21:31,980
<i>...stop playing with yourself!</i>

837
01:21:35,484 --> 01:21:36,777
It is God.

838
01:21:37,653 --> 01:21:39,446
Now what?

839
01:21:42,699 --> 01:21:44,117
Phase two.

840
01:21:46,703 --> 01:21:49,289
What is it with you?

841
01:23:30,974 --> 01:23:32,267
What's that?

842
01:23:32,851 --> 01:23:37,564
- These military are so untrusting.
- Can we get clearance?

843
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:42,528
- We will. It'll just take six hours.
- Forget it. We'll balls it.

844
01:23:42,778 --> 01:23:44,446
How do these look?

845
01:23:45,656 --> 01:23:48,742
Mine looks like him,
and his looks like me.

846
01:23:49,535 --> 01:23:50,869
Great, I hope.

847
01:23:51,119 --> 01:23:53,914
- What if they don't work?
- They shoot us.

848
01:23:59,628 --> 01:24:00,963
I. D?

849
01:24:04,842 --> 01:24:08,887
- Show these to the next guard.
- You bet.

850
01:24:19,982 --> 01:24:21,275
I.D. s?

851
01:24:21,650 --> 01:24:26,363
Can you snap it up?
We're late, we're tired, we're hungry.

852
01:24:27,447 --> 01:24:30,951
- Are you crazy?
- You gotta intimidate these guys.

853
01:24:32,327 --> 01:24:34,121
You're not on the list.

854
01:24:34,371 --> 01:24:37,416
Yeah, that's because we're classified.

855
01:24:41,003 --> 01:24:42,713
Security.

856
01:24:44,089 --> 01:24:46,508
Aren't you young for technicians?

857
01:24:46,758 --> 01:24:48,927
Lasers are a young science.

858
01:24:49,178 --> 01:24:52,598
There, I said it.
Now we're both in trouble.

859
01:24:52,890 --> 01:24:57,144
- I'll call the duty officer.
- Hey there, Airborne.

860
01:25:02,482 --> 01:25:07,779
Make that call, and it's our jobs.
We're four hours late.

861
01:25:08,071 --> 01:25:12,534
Give us a break. Someday you'll
be in the private sector.

862
01:25:12,784 --> 01:25:14,912
Yeah.

863
01:25:19,416 --> 01:25:21,502
We're dead.

864
01:25:25,255 --> 01:25:27,424
- All right!
- I love it!

865
01:25:29,343 --> 01:25:33,180
Absolutely, sir.
Consider it done.

866
01:25:33,472 --> 01:25:35,307
Yes, sir.

867
01:25:37,267 --> 01:25:41,188
Look for anything
out of the ordinary.

868
01:25:43,565 --> 01:25:45,984
Mitch, come here.

869
01:25:47,152 --> 01:25:48,570
My God.

870
01:25:52,366 --> 01:25:53,784
Come on.

871
01:26:22,896 --> 01:26:24,773
- Communication link?
- Open.

872
01:26:24,982 --> 01:26:28,527
Diagnostics seem okay.
Final check ready.

873
01:26:28,819 --> 01:26:31,780
Sixty-five degrees, nineteen minutes.

874
01:26:38,370 --> 01:26:42,124
All systems go.
We're finished here, fellas.

875
01:26:48,422 --> 01:26:49,673
What!?

876
01:27:19,161 --> 01:27:24,333
This little polynomial will
keep the computer busy.

877
01:27:26,835 --> 01:27:29,213
Where are they?

878
01:27:32,966 --> 01:27:35,886
We've got a connection!
They're in!

879
01:27:44,561 --> 01:27:46,855
<i>- Abbott to Costello.
- Go ahead.</i>

880
01:27:47,147 --> 01:27:50,984
<i>- We've got the goodies.
- We've got target coordinates.</i>

881
01:27:51,860 --> 01:27:54,905
Roger, we're sending.

882
01:28:01,578 --> 01:28:03,872
What is it?

883
01:28:06,333 --> 01:28:07,876
Oh, nothing.

884
01:28:11,004 --> 01:28:13,882
You didn't think we'd
test in space?

885
01:28:14,174 --> 01:28:18,512
Yes, I did, because
that's what it was designed for.

886
01:28:18,804 --> 01:28:22,599
But if you want to crawl
before we walk...

887
01:28:22,850 --> 01:28:26,019
...that's fine too.
Really.

888
01:28:26,687 --> 01:28:28,397
- Attention!
- What?

889
01:28:28,647 --> 01:28:31,692
- Superior officer in the room!
- As you were.

890
01:28:31,984 --> 01:28:35,445
We're ready for the final
on-board laser check.

891
01:28:48,125 --> 01:28:49,501
All clear.

892
01:28:49,751 --> 01:28:52,921
I'm replacing the PROM
with our EPROM.

893
01:28:58,260 --> 01:29:00,012
Okay, shoot.

894
01:29:05,017 --> 01:29:08,270
May I have the coordinates, please?

895
01:29:08,896 --> 01:29:13,942
34 degrees, 10 minutes.
15.21 seconds north.

896
01:29:14,985 --> 01:29:19,656
119 degrees, 7 minutes...

897
01:29:24,745 --> 01:29:26,455
Right this way.

898
01:29:28,957 --> 01:29:31,251
I'm gonna check the stairs.

899
01:29:43,138 --> 01:29:44,681
Hathaway's coming!

900
01:29:44,973 --> 01:29:48,810
Mitch has told me that
Herr Professor is approaching.

901
01:29:49,144 --> 01:29:51,355
- What now?
- Hathaway's coming.

902
01:29:51,939 --> 01:29:54,233
I don't work well under pressure.

903
01:29:57,653 --> 01:29:59,613
Watch your head there.

904
01:30:05,410 --> 01:30:06,662
I hope that works.

905
01:30:06,954 --> 01:30:10,916
Okay, Chris, I mean, Abbott.
Hello? Hello?

906
01:30:11,166 --> 01:30:13,043
They're gone!

907
01:30:13,252 --> 01:30:15,796
- Okay. Fine.
- Fine.

908
01:30:17,506 --> 01:30:21,218
Dr. Goy can answer
any questions you might have.

909
01:30:21,468 --> 01:30:24,805
Is there any problem
with reusing the weapon?

910
01:30:25,097 --> 01:30:31,520
No, the fuel is frozen
and contains a self-sufficient unit.

911
01:30:31,770 --> 01:30:35,148
The beauty of this system is...

912
01:30:35,899 --> 01:30:39,903
- Is everything all right here?
- Why shouldn't it be?

913
01:30:46,076 --> 01:30:49,204
I think that
just about sums it up.

914
01:30:49,496 --> 01:30:51,832
Shall we take our exit?

915
01:30:59,423 --> 01:31:02,134
- Okay, they're gone.
- That was close.

916
01:31:02,968 --> 01:31:07,139
Nothing like borrowing a B-1,
huh, general?

917
01:31:13,729 --> 01:31:14,980
What is it?

918
01:31:16,106 --> 01:31:18,525
Nothing.

919
01:31:23,572 --> 01:31:28,327
Diagnosis of schizophrenia
by objective personal analysis...

920
01:31:30,162 --> 01:31:32,164
<i>Hi, Kent.</i>

921
01:31:32,414 --> 01:31:36,335
Oh, I thought you'd gone.

922
01:31:36,627 --> 01:31:40,297
<i>Not yet.
Have you been touching yourself?</i>

923
01:31:40,589 --> 01:31:44,134
Yes. I mean, no!

924
01:31:44,593 --> 01:31:46,386
<i>Good.
Listen, Kent.</i>

925
01:31:47,304 --> 01:31:51,892
<i>Dad, you know, God,
wants to show you something.</i>

926
01:31:52,184 --> 01:31:54,603
Why?
I meant what?

927
01:31:54,853 --> 01:31:57,731
I've learned not to ask.

928
01:31:58,023 --> 01:32:01,693
He says to wait in front of
Dr. Hathaway's house...

929
01:32:01,985 --> 01:32:08,200
<i>...at 639 Ivy Crest Drive,
at precisely 7:08 this morning.</i>

930
01:32:09,368 --> 01:32:10,619
Ivy Crest?

931
01:32:10,911 --> 01:32:16,166
<i>Wait there and you shall receive
a sign, but do not go inside.</i>

932
01:32:16,416 --> 01:32:18,669
Well, why not?

933
01:32:21,338 --> 01:32:22,589
Hello?

934
01:32:23,966 --> 01:32:25,425
Hello, Jesus?

935
01:32:30,305 --> 01:32:31,849
He hung up.

936
01:32:47,698 --> 01:32:51,952
Crossbow One, radar contact,
heading 0-2-5.

937
01:32:52,202 --> 01:32:55,581
Maintain flight level 6-5-0.

938
01:32:55,873 --> 01:33:00,794
<i>Roger. Steer 0-2-5 out of five thousand
for flight level 6-5-0.</i>

939
01:33:25,736 --> 01:33:27,654
They're here.

940
01:33:31,074 --> 01:33:37,080
Mr. Knight, why is it that I am
not surprised to see you here?

941
01:33:37,372 --> 01:33:43,545
I suppose you have an explanation
for this event that we're to witness.

942
01:33:43,837 --> 01:33:48,550
First, let me compliment you
on your fashion sense.

943
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:51,136
Particularly your slippers.

944
01:33:52,930 --> 01:33:56,391
Yes, well, Philomena likes them.

945
01:33:56,683 --> 01:33:58,227
Hey, guys!

946
01:33:59,811 --> 01:34:01,855
Good morning.

947
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:06,735
Congressman Doogan.
What brings you around?

948
01:34:06,985 --> 01:34:11,406
I was told there was a situation
of international importance.

949
01:34:18,455 --> 01:34:23,168
The weapon is controlled from
this module, as it would be in space.

950
01:34:23,460 --> 01:34:26,630
This is an exact duplicate
of the cockpit.

951
01:34:26,922 --> 01:34:29,132
The accuracy will be as exact.

952
01:34:29,383 --> 01:34:34,847
<i>- We are nearing the target.
- Open the bomb bay doors.</i>

953
01:34:43,689 --> 01:34:47,067
- Those are serious accusations.
- I know.

954
01:34:47,359 --> 01:34:50,988
If it's true,
I'm going to need proof.

955
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:54,700
We can accommodate you
in just one minute.

956
01:34:54,992 --> 01:34:56,994
Duck.

957
01:34:58,871 --> 01:35:00,873
Congressman?

958
01:35:42,873 --> 01:35:45,542
Now, listen to me, Jesus.

959
01:35:46,710 --> 01:35:51,673
This is Jerry's house,
and we're very close.

960
01:35:51,924 --> 01:35:56,178
If you don't answer me,
I'm just gonna have to go in.

961
01:35:59,014 --> 01:36:01,391
- So I'm going.
- No, Kent!

962
01:36:01,934 --> 01:36:04,937
- Get away!
- Kent!

963
01:36:10,817 --> 01:36:13,195
Target locked.
In ten.

964
01:36:14,988 --> 01:36:16,406
<i>Nine.</i>

965
01:36:17,407 --> 01:36:18,867
<i>E ight.</i>

966
01:36:23,956 --> 01:36:27,042
- Kent!
- Come out, Kent!

967
01:36:39,555 --> 01:36:43,433
Okay, God!
Let me have it!

968
01:37:28,353 --> 01:37:30,939
Popcorn!

969
01:37:52,377 --> 01:37:54,546
I don't understand.
Did it fire?

970
01:37:54,838 --> 01:37:56,924
Yes, but there's a problem.

971
01:37:57,174 --> 01:38:00,802
- It's not shutting down.
- Well, shut it down!

972
01:38:01,053 --> 01:38:03,805
- What's the problem?
- Shut it down!

973
01:38:05,182 --> 01:38:06,391
Kent!

974
01:38:26,828 --> 01:38:28,747
Kent.

975
01:38:35,420 --> 01:38:38,382
- Kent, you okay?
- That was great!

976
01:38:52,437 --> 01:38:54,606
Something is very wrong.

977
01:38:54,940 --> 01:38:57,025
Out!

978
01:38:58,110 --> 01:38:59,987
Unlock the bird's-eye.

979
01:39:00,654 --> 01:39:01,905
Unlocked.

980
01:39:03,073 --> 01:39:07,286
I'm tracking where the shot went.
I want to know it worked.

981
01:39:16,086 --> 01:39:18,881
Oh, no.

982
01:39:20,007 --> 01:39:24,011
- My house.
- What have you done?

983
01:39:31,059 --> 01:39:33,020
All right!

984
01:39:56,585 --> 01:39:57,586
It's Hollyfeld...

985
01:39:57,836 --> 01:39:59,588
...in a Winnebago!

986
01:40:04,426 --> 01:40:06,553
Lazlo, buddy!

987
01:40:08,931 --> 01:40:11,350
I think we used too much.

988
01:40:12,267 --> 01:40:15,604
- I'm sorry you missed it.
- I had to pack.

989
01:40:15,854 --> 01:40:18,315
- Why?
- Well, I'm getting married.

990
01:40:18,732 --> 01:40:22,110
- To whom?
- What is all this stuff?

991
01:40:22,694 --> 01:40:26,740
Oh, yeah. I won,
31.8% of the prizes.

992
01:40:27,032 --> 01:40:30,077
I'll figure it out.
But not this summer.

993
01:40:30,786 --> 01:40:34,456
Sherry?
Sherry Nugil?

994
01:40:38,252 --> 01:40:41,088
Isn't it great?
This is number one.

995
01:40:43,048 --> 01:40:46,552
I've been looking for him
for ten years.

996
01:40:51,306 --> 01:40:55,352
- What can I say? She loves me.
- Congratulations.

997
01:40:58,814 --> 01:41:01,733
- You'll have to come and visit us.
- What?

998
01:41:01,984 --> 01:41:05,654
I have a little
survival place in Wyoming.

999
01:41:05,904 --> 01:41:09,533
Yeah, it's getting
kinda weird around here.

1000
01:41:09,783 --> 01:41:12,870
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

1001
01:41:27,384 --> 01:41:30,971
- Is it getting too weird around here?
- Absolutely.

1002
01:41:31,221 --> 01:41:34,933
- I didn't notice.
- I like it.

1003
01:45:51,940 --> 01:45:52,900
