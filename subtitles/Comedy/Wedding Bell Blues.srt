00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:57,300
Have you ever wondered how Nature gets its glow?

3
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:04,300
Who gives it light and colour as the 
seasons come and go?

4
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,900
Who helps all creatures great and small...

5
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,600
to walk, to swim, to fly?

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,100
Who crafts such tiny details?

7
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,600
You might see them if you try...

8
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,500
For it's all the work of fairies, but
they stay well out of sight...

9
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:41,700
The first time that a baby laughs, a fairy's 
life takes flight...

10
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,600
When the moon comes up to shine her face...

11
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,700
and the birds are fast asleep...

12
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:52,700
And the lanterns hang from every post,

13
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,200
The fairies leave their keep!

14
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:59,200
They join their hands and sing their songs,

15
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,600
The mariners all can't hear!

16
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,500
In the springtime when the earth is new,

17
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The fairies might draw near!

18
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,500
The fairies might draw near!

19
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
TINKER BELL

20
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,100
- Hello!
- Hello?

21
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:54,500
Queen Clarion!

22
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,700
Born of laughter, clothed in cheer,
Happiness has brought you here!

23
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:13,700
Welcome to Pixie Hollow!

24
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:17,000
- I trust you found your way all right!
- I... think so.

25
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,400
Now let's see about those wings!

26
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,900
- What are these things?
- They will help you find your talent, little one.

27
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:17,200
- But how will I know which one is...
- You'll know!

28
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:59,100
I've never seen one glow that much before!
Even for Vidia!

29
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:04,200
You know, I do believe you're right! Little 
daisy top might be a very rare talent indeed!

30
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,600
Come forward, Tinker fairies and welcome...

31
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:21,700
the newest member of your talent guild... Tinker Bell!

32
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:28,200
- I'm glad we had a bath today!
- Excuse us! Coming through!

33
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,500
Make way for Tinkers! Hy-dy high,
hy-dy how, Miss Bell!

34
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:37,100
- I'm Clank!
- Splinters, Clank, say it, don't spray it!

35
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,100
Phineas T. Kettletree, Esquire, at your service!

36
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:46,200
- Pleased to make your acquaintance!
- Oh, foo... He's Boble, I'm Clank!

37
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,700
Clank, Boble!

38
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,200
We're pleased as a pile of perfectly polished 
pots you're here!

39
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,000
Aaa... me, too! 

40
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:02,000
Come on, miss Bell, there's so much to show you!

41
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:06,000
You've arrived at a most wonderous and
glorious time!

42
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:10,100
- Really? Why?
- It's almost time for the changing of the seasons!

43
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:17,400
You see, here in Pixie Hollow, there are
different realms for every time of year!

44
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,900
There's one up ahead!

45
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,900
Winter Woods, it's always cold here!

46
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,000
Look there! Snowflake and Frost fairies
returning home...

47
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,400
... for some well-deserved rest!

48
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,100
We've just finished bringing winter to the world.

49
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,800
It's the off-season for autumn fairies, too.

50
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,600
Always practising that perfect shade of amber, hey.

51
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,100
And the fairies of Summer Glade still have plenty
of time to get ready!

52
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:52,900
But not as much as the autumn fairies, 
of course, because, well...

53
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:57,300
Yes, Clank, because right now fairies of every
talent are preparing for my favorite season,

54
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:02,200
Springtime.

55
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:07,500
Get along, get along, little sproutings 
and dig.

56
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:15,400
- Hello, there!
- Come on, miss Bell, you've got to see where we live.

57
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:27,200
Welcome to Tinker's Nook!

58
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,100
Come on, there's so much to show you.

59
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,600
Oh, cute.

60
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,600
Just taking some supplies down to the workshop.

61
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,500
Let her go.

62
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,700
Watch out for falling maple seeds!

63
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,600
Wow.

64
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:42,200
- And over here is where most of us live!
- There's your house, Tinker Bell!

65
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:52,700
- Ah, it's mine?
- Sure is.

66
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:56,600
We were hoping that the new arrival would be
one of us, so we got the place all ready.

67
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,700
- We rounded up some work clothes!
- We did not know your size!

68
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,900
- Our apologies, but...
- They might be too big!

69
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,200
- That's only because you're so tiny.
- Please come on down to the workshop when you're ready.

70
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:14,600
- Fairy Mary will want to meet you.
- Goodbye!

71
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,900
- Stop!
- What?

72
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:11,700
A five-gauge twig for an axle?
Clank, I told you it took a seven.

73
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
- You said five!
- I said a seven! Oh, Clank, I tell you,
sometimes you can be pretty,

74
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:20,000
- Pretty...
- So...

75
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Pretty.

76
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:29,600
- Who's that, then?
- It's Tinker Bell, you snail brain!

77
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:33,900
Wow, everyone seems so busy!

78
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:37,200
Well, spring won't spring itself.

79
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:41,000
Indeed my bellowing buddy and we Tinkers are
a big part of it.

80
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:45,900
Allow us to elucidate, miss Bell!

81
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,500
- We fiddle and fix.
- We craft and create.

82
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,500
- We carve acorn buckets.
- To hold flower paints. 

83
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,000
- With saddles and saches.
- For birdies, you see.

84
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,200
- We make baskets and bushels.
- To carry the seeds.

85
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,800
- We're preparing for spring.
- We do all these and more.

86
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,100
- Yes!
- Because being a Tinker is never a bore.

87
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:09,500
- That was great.
- So you see, miss Bell, we help fairies 
of every talent with our creations.

88
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:14,700
Unfortunately, all those fairies are out of luck this year!

89
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:18,200
Unless we can actually deliver these things to them!

90
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:23,600
- The waggon repairs are finished, I trust?
- Yes, Fairy Mary.

91
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:28,300
- They're top shaped.
- No wheel is missing whatsoever.

92
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,400
Then let's see it!

93
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:36,900
- Define seeing actually!
- With your eyes!

94
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,200
- You have to meet Tinker Bell!
- What?

95
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:44,100
- Who?
- She's new, Fairy Mary.

96
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:48,400
- Nice to meet you!
- Oh, rapture! A new charge on whom we can 
lavish all our...

97
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,100
tinkering wisdom and expertise!

98
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:56,600
Let me see those hands! Oh, so dainty!

99
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:00,200
Don't worry, dear! We'll build up those 
Tinker muscles in no time!

100
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:04,800
- Ok!
- Now, boys, the deliveries!

101
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:09,200
We're on it! As a matter of fact, we're 
heading out right this second!

102
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:14,500
- But we've only got one wheel.
- What was that?

103
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:18,400
- Nothing really, Clank was just asking...
- If...

104
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:22,600
- I can go as well.
- Yes!

105
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:26,600
- I wondered that.
- That's exactly what he was saying!

106
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,600
Very well, get on with it, then!

107
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,500
Slow down, Cheese. I can't keep up!

108
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
- The mouse's name is Cheese?
- It must be! He always comes when we yell it!

109
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:13,200
Sprinting thistles!

110
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,300
Aaa!

111
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:52,400
Easy! Easy, boy!

112
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:56,900
It's alright, Fawn's got you!

113
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Easy, easy girl, it's alright, Silvermist's got you!

114
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
- Oh, you alright, sugar cake?
- Be careful, Rosetta, she may faint!

115
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,900
- Elevate her legs!
- No, wait, I mean her head.

116
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,900
Wait, wait, if she's red, raise the head,
if she's pale, raise the tail.

117
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,100
- Does she look pale or red?
- She looks squished!

118
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,200
- Sorry.
- Here, let me, rain drop! So...

119
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,600
what happened to you, anyway?

120
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:26,700
- Well...
- It was sprinting thisles!

121
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,700
Those weeds are an absolute mess! Always tramping 
things, poking people in the petunia!

122
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,100
Gather around, ladies!

123
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:39,800
We've brought some selections from the new 
spring line of Tinkers' specialities!

124
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,100
- Alright!
- Show us!

125
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,100
- Your rainbow tubes, Iridessa!
- Finally!

126
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,500
Silvermist, could you help me?

127
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,200
- Wow, what are you going to do with that?
- I'm gonna take it to the Mainland.

128
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:14,000
- What's the Mainland?
- It's where we are going to change winter to spring. 

129
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,000
The seasons change all the time there.

130
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:21,700
I'll get to apply my artistic sensibilities.

131
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:25,600
And I'll have breakfast ready for all the 
little fuzzies coming out of hibernation.

132
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:29,800
We just follow the second star...

133
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,100
We ride the breeze, we follow the waves...

134
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,200
- All the way across the sea.
- Then, there it is.

135
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:40,000
Wow! The Mainland sounds flitterific!

136
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:47,500
Yes, the glamourous lives of the Nature talent fairies!

137
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:51,900
- We'd love to stay and chat...
- But we Tinkers have real work to do!

138
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:56,700
We know. Don't we like that!

139
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,500
- Nice to meet you all.
- You, too! Bye! Later!

140
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:07,200
Right, here we are... a pretty 
large order of polen pots for...

141
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:25,600
- The last thing is...
- Is it ok if I just catch up with you later?

142
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:30,500
- I suppose.
- Can you find your way back?

143
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:34,300
Yeah, yeah, sure I can.

144
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,700
- Alright then.
- Just be careful!

145
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Hi, there... sorry...

146
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:49,000
Vidia, right?

147
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:57,000
We didn't officially meet. I'm Tinker Bell.

148
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:02,300
- Oh, yes, the new girl.
- That's right.

149
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,900
- So, what's your talent?
- What do you think it is?

150
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
You're a poleniser?

151
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Polenator? Polen-picker? Polenflucker?

152
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:19,400
I am a fast flying fairy. A true rare talent.

153
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:22,200
And this is but a small part of what I do.

154
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:27,600
I make breezes in the summer. I blow down leaves 
in the fall. My winds even brought you here, dear.

155
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,800
Fairies of every talent depend on me.

156
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,500
- Hey, that's just like what I do. 
- Excuse me?

157
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,000
I mean Tinkers help fairies of every talent, too, so...

158
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,400
We're kind of the same, you know?

159
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:47,100
Sweetie, I make forces of Nature.

160
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,400
You make pots and kettles.

161
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:54,700
I work up in the sky and you work down in a ditch.

162
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,500
- Hey!
- Don't get me wrong, sunshine!

163
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:01,200
Being a tinker is really swell and all, 
but I wouldn't go...

164
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,400
around bragging about your talent! It's 
not like spring depends on you!

165
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:09,100
Of course it does! And when I go to the Mainland, 
I'll prove just how important we are!

166
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:14,000
- When who goes to the Mainland?
- Me, of course!

167
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,700
- For spring!
- Oh, of course!

168
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,600
- You'll prove it, huh?
- Yes, I will...

169
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,900
Well, I for one, am looking forward to that.

170
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:28,200
Excuse me.

171
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:32,900
No, excuse me.

172
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,700
Mine is a rare talent!

173
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,900
A!

174
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,900
Don't tell me Tinkers don't matter.

175
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,700
I'll show her what rare talent really is when I'll...

176
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,100
- Hey, Tink. What you got there?
- Oh, hi.

177
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:28,700
- I don't know, I just found them.
- Lost things.

178
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,200
Uuu, lost things!

179
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,700
Hey, stuff gets lost and washes up on 
Neverland from day to day.

180
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,600
- You know, from the Mainland.
- These come from the Mainland?

181
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,600
That place sounds more fascinating all the time.

182
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,500
Fairy potions, checked! Polen pots, checked!

183
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,600
Lost things, checked!

184
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,200
Lost things? Why are you fiddling with that junk?

185
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:56,000
They were just so... unusual!

186
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:59,800
You should not be wasting your time with that rubbish.

187
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:03,900
And I won't have it cluttering up my workshop.

188
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:08,600
And as for you two... No more 
dilly-dallying around!

189
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:12,700
And don't forget about the queen's 
review tonight. Goodness!

190
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:17,500
There's still so much to be done! Thank you!

191
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,400
Sorry about your trinkets, miss Bell.

192
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,600
Well, we best be getting ready for the review, anyway.

193
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,400
- What is the queen's review?
- You see, the queen...

194
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,800
is going to review all the preparations for spring.

195
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
- It is a good time for us Tinkers to show what we can do, hey?
- Indeed!

196
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,500
- Really?
- Like me, I can be a wheel!

197
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,400
Perfect.

198
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,700
That's my chance.

199
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,200
Ok, everybody, turn! Ready for the phase code over here!

200
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,400
A, splendid, splendid.

201
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,000
There's plenty of time before the queen arrives.

202
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,600
- A! It's the queen!
- What? She's here? Now?

203
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:09,000
Play, Music fairies.

204
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,800
Play.

205
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,500
Queen Clarion, your illustriousness, 
as minister of spring,

206
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:29,000
I welcome you to Springtime Square.

207
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,500
- What? No fireworks, minister?
- A, well, that could be arranged!

208
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,700
- Light fairies, light fairies.
- I'm teasing you.

209
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,200
You always make such a fuss and everything 
turns out wonderfully.

210
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,200
Well, I think that you'll find that 
we have things well in hand.

211
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:52,700
The ever-blossom blooms will be ready to 
bring spring to the Mainland.

212
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,900
Music to my ears.

213
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,100
I know you all put in months of practice 
and preparation.

214
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,000
But keep up the good work these last few days
because just as fairies...

215
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,500
Queen Clarion! Queen Clarion!

216
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,100
Did I miss anything?

217
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:12,700
- No, no, no.
- Good.

218
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:15,100
It's alright.

219
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,900
I came up with some fantastic things for 
Tinkers to use when we go to the Mainland.

220
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,400
Let me show you.

221
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,700
First, baby chipmunks can't eat the whole 
nut, right?

222
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:32,600
Their little teeth can't chew big bites.

223
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,200
So, you just crank back this lever and its...

224
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:47,200
Ups...

225
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:50,700
It's kind of a work in progress!

226
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,700
Yes, yes, yes, very clever.

227
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,100
Oh, and I made this, too. It's a flower-sprayer.

228
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,200
- Tinker Bell, I...
- Allow me to demonstrate!

229
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,900
Sorry!!!

230
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,800
- But, but, wait till you see this last one!
- Tinker Bell!

231
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:17,700
Sweetheart, has no one explained?

232
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,500
Explain what?

233
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,300
- Tinker fairies don't go to the Mainland, dear.
- What?

234
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,400
All of those things are done by the Nature talent fairies!

235
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:32,100
Your work is here, in Pixie Hollow!

236
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:37,600
- But... but I thought that...
- I'm sorry, Tinker Bell!

237
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:41,700
Ok, no, no, that's good!

238
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:45,900
I mean I couldn't make it, anyway, so...

239
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,000
Good, this actually works out good.

240
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:52,000
I mean well, so I...

241
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,500
I'm just gonna... yeah.

242
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:14,200
Back so soon?

243
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:17,000
- You didn't go?
- Goodness, no.

244
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,200
Far too much work to do down here!

245
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,100
Vidia was right.

246
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:34,100
- Being a Tinker stinks!
- Excuse me?

247
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:38,200
It's just that... why don't we get 
to go to the Mainland?

248
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,500
Oh, the Mainland? 

249
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,400
Who gives a pile of pebbles about the Mainland?

250
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,400
But Fairy Mary, the other fairies get to go.

251
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,500
Now, Tinker Bell, are you a garden fairy? 

252
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:54,700
- Well, no.
- Are you a light fairy?

253
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,600
- No.
- Animal fairy?

254
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,000
- Water fairy perhaps?
- No and no.

255
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:04,000
No, you're not. You are a Tinker. 
It's who you are.

256
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:07,700
Be proud of it.

257
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,400
The day you can magically make the flowers grow,

258
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:14,500
or capture the rays of the sun, then you can go.

259
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,500
Until then your work is here.

260
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:45,800
Good idea, Fairy Mary.

261
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
- Here you go, Silvermist.
- Thank you, Terrence.

262
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
- Oh, I hope Tinker Bell is ok.
- I know that, poor little sapling.

263
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,300
She looked pretty wilted yesterday.

264
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:14,200
- I wouldn't blame her is she stayed in bed all day.
- Good morning, girls!

265
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:18,900
- Tinker Bell!
- Guess what? I've decided I'm ...

266
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
- ...not gonna be a tinker fairy anymore!
- What?

267
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,500
Well, I was thinking. Why do I have to be a tinker?
Because some silly hammer glowed?

268
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,900
I mean who's to say it wasn't some big mistake?

269
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,500
- Maybe I can just switch my talent!
- Switch your talent? I don't know, Tinker Bell!

270
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:38,600
If you could teach me your talents, any of you,
maybe I...

271
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:42,300
could show the queen I can work with nature, too.

272
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:45,900
And then she would let me go to the 
Mainland for spring!

273
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,300
Tinker Bell, that's just not how it works.

274
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:52,200
- Well, maybe she could.
- She's right, she could!

275
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:55,700
- Well, I've never heard of someone switching talents before.
- She's right, me neither!

276
00:30:55,700 --> 00:31:00,000
Look, you all do things that are beautiful and... 

277
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:04,900
... magical and important...

278
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:11,100
... but me, well, there's got to be more to my 
life than just pots and kettles...

279
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:14,100
All I'm asking is that you give me a chance!

280
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,000
I'll help you, Tinker Bell!

281
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,400
- Thank you so...
- Me, too!

282
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:25,200
- Me, too. Could be fun!
- Well, first time for everything, I guess!

283
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,900
- What harm could come from trying?
- Well...

284
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:31,200
I still think this is a bad idea.

285
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:34,600
So, for your first day of Water fairy 
training, I could...

286
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:37,600
Show you how to make dripples in the pond.

287
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,100
- Ok.
- Or... teach you how to talk to the babbling brook!

288
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:44,200
- That sounds fun, too.
- Wait, wait, I got it! I got it!

289
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:48,100
Dew-drops on spider-webs!

290
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:52,000
- Come on, I'll show you how to do it!
- Good luck, Tink! 

291
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:55,400
- You can do it!
- Aaa...

292
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:58,000
Go get them!

293
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,900
Just cup your hands like this, reach 
into the water,

294
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:08,600
and ok, you heard of the dew-drop?

295
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:13,700
This is a dow-drop. That's water-fairy humour.

296
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,700
- It's good.
- Come on!

297
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:21,100
Ok, Tink, now this next part could be 
a little tricky!

298
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:25,800
It takes a very steady, delicate hand to...

299
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,900
- Aaa... Where is your dew-drop?
- Oh!

300
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:34,100
Forgot my dew-drop.

301
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:38,100
Hey, I did ... it.

302
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:42,100
Shake that one off! Shake it off!

303
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:46,500
You can do this!

304
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,500
That's it!

305
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,600
- That's it, Tink, you're doing it!
- Good...

306
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,900
- Uuu...
- Now, Tink... try to... oh, no, sweetie...

307
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,700
- You need to... maybe if you... 
- Well, you have to admire her persistence.

308
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:04,500
- Tinker Bell!
- You know, sometimes hammers glow...

309
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:07,500
... for a reason.

310
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:29,700
You know, you always struck me as 
a light fairy kind of girl.

311
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:53,900
- Have you seen Tink?
- No, thank you, not thirsty.

312
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,800
No, no, not drink, Tink!

313
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:00,900
- Pink? Well, I'm purple myself!
- Tink! Have you seen Tink?

314
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,700
What? I do not stink! Maybe it's you, hey!

315
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,600
Hey, have you seen Tink?

316
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:14,400
Oh, Fairy Mary is gonna be crossed.

317
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:19,400
We'd better take some of these off 
miss Bell's plate.

318
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:23,400
- Right.
- No, no, no, wait!

319
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:29,700
Was it a... Would you two stop mocking about?

320
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:33,600
- Clunk here...
- You see, Bobble...

321
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:37,500
I see Tinker Bell has got her work done mysteriously!

322
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:41,400
- Where is she, anyway?
- Oh, you see, she's...

323
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:45,600
She went with Cheese to...

324
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:48,400
No, no, Clunk means... she went to get cheese.

325
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:51,200
- The food for Cheese the mouse!
- yes, the food for Cheese!

326
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:56,400
- Because the mouse... he was... whining!
- Like a baby!

327
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:59,100
A wee-baby!

328
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:15,800
Ok, what can I teach you that's gonna 
do the least amount of damage?

329
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,200
Oh, I know!

330
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:24,700
Follow me, Tinker Bell!

331
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:28,500
Wow, the last light of day!

332
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:32,500
It's the richest kind of all! Wait for it, wait...

333
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:36,500
... for it... Oh, ok and now!

334
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:40,100
Oh, wow!

335
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,700
Oh!

336
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:47,100
- It's incredible!
- Now, for the fun part!

337
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:51,600
- Hum, do you think it's heavy?
- No, it's light!

338
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:56,200
Ha-ha!

339
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:10,500
Ok, ok!

340
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,200
- Stay!
- Here, Tink, let me!

341
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:43,700
- No, I almost got it!
- I could just get it started!

342
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:47,600
This is impossible!

343
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:51,100
Look out!

344
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:59,500
Oh, no! Ooo!!!

345
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:03,700
Aaa!

346
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:07,000
I wonder how it's going!

347
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,500
Fly, Tink, fly!

348
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
- We'll save you, Tink!
- Cover your... tushy!

349
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,600
To hold flower paint!

350
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:39,600
- Preparing for spring!
- We do all these and more!

351
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:43,800
- Yes!
- Because being a Tinker is never a bore!

352
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:47,500
- Tinker Bell, I'd like a word with you!
- Fairy Mary!

353
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:51,800
You see, I was on my deliveries and... 
it's actually kind of a...

354
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:55,500
Save it! I know what you've been up to, missy!

355
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
And I had such high hopes for you!

356
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:15,200
- You would do well to listen to her!
- Why? So I can do this for the rest of my life?!

357
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,000
I don't wanna be just a stupid tinker!

358
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:24,100
No, no! Not that you guys are...

359
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:29,200
I didn't mean that... guys, I wasn't...

360
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,000
I have to go.

361
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,400
Now flap them! Flap them, that's it!

362
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:55,500
Have fun!

363
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,900
Hey, Tink! You're ready?

364
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:03,100
A little nervous... actually!

365
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:07,200
Don't be silly, come on, you'll be fine!

366
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,000
We're teaching baby-birds how to fly.

367
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:14,000
First, you have to get their attention. 
Smile and establish trust.

368
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,500
See? Ok. Open your wings, honey 
and flap them.

369
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:23,000
Up and down, up and down, that's the way!

370
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:27,500
Faster! Faster, that's right! Yes, you're doing it!

371
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:31,700
Ok, now, come out this way a little bit. 
You're ok, you're ok.

372
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,200
You got it! Keep flaping! Keep flaping! 

373
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:39,400
Hey, why don't you help that last little guy?

374
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:46,600
Ok, ok, just smile and establish trust.

375
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:50,600
Hi there! Hey, little fella...

376
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:54,000
You wanna do some flap-flap today?

377
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Oh, sure you do... all you do is you just...

378
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,400
You just flap your wings like this!

379
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:06,000
No, no, no, no, no! None of that, come on!

380
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:10,600
All we got to do is... Awwwww...

381
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,700
Look, I'm gonna level with you, ok?

382
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:17,500
I kind of bummed down on the whole 
water and light fairy things. 

383
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:21,100
I'm starting to run out of options here.

384
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,700
If you could see fit to flap your little wings 
and take flight for a few measly seconds,

385
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,900
I might be able to go to the mainland and 
bring happiness to the world!

386
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:32,900
What do you say? Wrong answer!

387
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:38,500
Oh, if I get stuck making acorn 
kettles for the rest of my life,

388
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:43,000
- I'm holding you personally responsible.
- Hey, hey! Look at this!

389
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,700
Stop squirming! Just... 

390
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,600
Hey! 

391
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:54,500
Ok, ok, I'm letting go! I am letting go!

392
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:59,100
This is not working!

393
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,600
Hey, maybe that guy can help. He's 
a really good flyer.

394
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:09,200
Hey, up there!

395
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,000
Hawk!

396
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:25,400
Quick, hide!

397
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:35,200
A hawk! Tinker Bell is in trouble!

398
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:51,100
- Vidia!
- Hey, this is my hiding spot!

399
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:55,500
But it's all yours now.

400
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:58,600
Aaa!

401
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:03,400
Aaa!

402
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:13,700
Get him!

403
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,700
- Are you ok, Vidia?
- Aaa...

404
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:37,100
- Let me help you!
- Don't touch me!

405
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:40,300
- I'm fine!
- I was only trying to help!

406
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:44,900
Stop trying!

407
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:50,900
- Tinker Bell...
- Ha! I can't hold water,

408
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:54,400
I can't hold light, birds hate me...

409
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:59,200
- I'm just so... so useless.
- Tink!

410
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:15,000
Great! I failed for the third time in a row.

411
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:18,500
At this rate, I should get to the Mainland right about...

412
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:21,300
... never!

413
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:28,000
Sil...

414
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,600
Beautiful!

415
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:46,000
- You fixed it!
- Wow!

416
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,200
- Amazing!
- What are you guys doing here?

417
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:53,700
It might be sparkliest thing I've ever seen!

418
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:57,000
- And I've seen a lot of sparkly things!
- It's a really pretty thingy!

419
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:00,000
- What is it?
- I don't know. I just found it!

420
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:05,200
Tinker Bell, don't you ever realize what 
you're doing? You're tinkering!

421
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:10,800
Creating those gadgets, figuring things out,
fixing stuff, like this!

422
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,100
That's what tinkering is, sweetie.

423
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:17,200
Don't you like doing this? Isn't it what 
you really love?

424
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:21,000
- Yeah, who cares about going to the Mainland, anyway?
- Well, I do, remember?

425
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:24,000
I wanna see where these things come from!

426
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:27,100
Why are you saying this, so you're 
just giving up on me?

427
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:31,600
I mean aren't you going to teach me to be 
a garden fairy anymore?

428
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:34,800
Oh, sweetie, I think this is your talent!

429
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:37,100
Tink, we just want you to be happy.

430
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:41,900
If you really want me to be happy, you'd help me 
get to the Mainland, like you promissed!

431
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,700
Please, Tinker Bell, just... just think about it!

432
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:27,700
Will you teach me how to be a fast-flying fairy?

433
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,900
Please! I know I could do it!

434
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:35,400
With your help, I could be flying as 
fast as you in no time!

435
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:39,200
Vidia, you're my last hope! All my friends 
have given up on me!

436
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:44,500
Rosetta won't even try to teach me to 
be a garden fairy now!

437
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:48,100
I bet I could at least paint some flowers or...

438
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:53,900
... plant some sproutings! There must 
be something I could do!

439
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:59,200
Or if you really want to be a garden fairy...

440
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:15,100
Capture the sprinting thistles! Aaa! Well!

441
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:19,300
Ok, I can do this! Yeah!

442
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:23,900
Ok! Ready, Cheese?

443
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,400
Oh, come on! They're just wheeds!

444
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:32,700
Besides, they're only 7 or 8 at the 
most, right? 

445
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:48,000
We can do this! I know we can do this!

446
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,100
What do you say? 

447
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:08,200
This ought to be good!

448
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,200
Hey!

449
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:24,000
Come on, you! Come on, just...

450
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:29,600
This way! Ah, it's working! It's working!

451
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:34,200
Ha!

452
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,100
Come on!

453
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,700
Aaa!

454
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,500
Wait, wait, wait! Come back!

455
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:51,700
Come back!

456
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:54,100
Ah, these things just won't listen!

457
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:58,300
Come on, Cheese, go, go, go!

458
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:05,900
Hey, definitely more than eight!

459
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,900
Please, file and get to the ground in an 
orderly manner!

460
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,700
Wait!

461
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:18,500
Oh, no! Come on!

462
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:35,900
Sorry, sorry! Excuse me!

463
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:38,100
I'm so sorry!

464
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:42,000
This is the last patch!

465
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,800
Look out!

466
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:49,600
Sorry! Sorry!

467
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,400
- Oh, no!
- Tink, what happened?

468
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:48,000
- Tinker Bell, what did you think you 
were doing?
- I was just...

469
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:52,000
I was just trying to... I thought that if I 
could capture the thistles, then...

470
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,400
There isn't a garden fairy alive who can 
control those weeds!

471
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:59,200
- What were you trying to prove?
- I...

472
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
She's right, Tink, this is all gone too far!

473
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,100
By the second star!

474
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:14,600
All the preparations for spring! How did this...

475
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:25,700
Queen Clarion! It...

476
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:28,700
It was me! I did it!

477
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:33,500
- It's all my fault!
- Tinker Bell!

478
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:36,400
I'm sorry!

479
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,600
I don't think we can fix this in time!
We're going to have to cancel spring!

480
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:59,900
Or postpone it, to the very least!

481
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:03,300
What? And put my fairies back to work?
But we can't, we can't do that! If...

482
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:06,900
The snow isn't melted, the...

483
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,100
And then in autumn, there will be 
nothing to harvest!

484
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:13,000
Spring must happen on time, or the 
balance of nature will be undone!

485
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:17,800
- There must be something we can do!
- Certainly this has happened before!

486
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:20,400
- It has, did you ever hear of the Ice Age?
- Settle down! All of you!

487
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:24,500
Fairy Mary, is it even possible to redo 
everything in such a short time?

488
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:32,000
- No!
- Oh, no!

489
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:36,700
We were so close, now it's all gone!

490
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,400
Who's going to paint our leaves now?

491
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:44,200
- Plants will never grow!
- No more hills covered in daffodils?

492
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:18,200
- You're ok, Tink?
- Oh, yeah!

493
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:21,200
Yeah, I'm fine!

494
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:25,100
I just came hoping to get a quick refill!

495
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:29,200
- I'm going away for a while.
- Oh, how long are you going to be gone?

496
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:33,200
- Well, actually, forever!
- Forever? Well...

497
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:37,100
In that case...

498
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:40,900
A double scoop!

499
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:45,000
- Forever is a pretty long time, so I hear!
- Thanks, Terrence!

500
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:49,700
- You know my name?
- Well, sure. Why wouldn't I?

501
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:53,200
I don't know. I'm just a dust keeper guy.

502
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:57,200
I'm not exactly seen as the most 
important fairy in Pixie Hollow!

503
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:01,800
Terrence, what are you talking about? You're 
probably the most important one there is!

504
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:05,400
Without you, no one would have any magic.

505
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:08,000
Your talent makes who you are! You 
should be proud of it!

506
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,900
I am!

507
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,100
I... I... I'd better get going!

508
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:59,900
Oh, oh, hey, Cheese!

509
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:05,900
Be proud of your talent! What talent?

510
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:09,100
I couldn't even get these silly things to work!

511
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:24,000
Aaa... Lost things!

512
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:41,100
That's it!

513
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,400
Attention, everyone!

514
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,400
I'm afraid I have distressing news!

515
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:59,500
There is no way spring can come on time!

516
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:03,900
Months of work was lost.

517
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:07,700
And it will take us months to restore it all.

518
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:10,800
So when the ever blossom opens tomorrow,
I'm afraid we will not be going to the...

519
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:14,600
Mainland for spring.

520
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:17,700
Wait! I know how we can fix everything!

521
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:21,400
Tinker Bell?

522
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:26,000
- Tinker Bell, I don't think this is...
- Just hear me out.

523
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,200
Please!... You!

524
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:34,100
How long does it take you to paint a ladybug?

525
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:38,000
I don't know. Ten, 15 minutes, I guess!

526
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,900
See? We can build more!

527
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,000
I can show you how! Making paints, gathering 
seeds, we can do it all in no time!

528
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:09,600
- We have to at least try!
- Wait! Are we going to listen to her?

529
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:13,200
She's the reason we're in this mess in 
the first place!

530
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:17,500
- But I can fix...
- Tinker Bell is going to save us,

531
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:21,100
with her dopey little do-hickies!

532
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:25,500
What is your problem, Vidia? Why do 
you think you're so much better than me?

533
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:29,200
I am better than you, sweetie, I didn't 
ruin spring!

534
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:33,200
At least now I'm trying to help! Have you 
ever helped anyone besides yourself?

535
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:37,700
Well, I tried to help you! Maybe I should have 
told you to...

536
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:40,600
... capture the hawk instead of the thistles!

537
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Perhaps Tinker Bell was not the only one responsible!

538
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:55,700
It seems to me that your fast-flying talent is well 
suited to chasing down...

539
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:59,600
... each and everyone of the thistles!

540
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:03,500
- Me?
- Yes. And I expect them all...

541
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,800
... to be returned to Neddlepoint Meadow as 
soon as possible!

542
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:11,600
But... but that could take forever!

543
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:15,400
Then I suggest you get started!

544
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Now, Tinker Bell, are you sure you can do this?

545
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:30,600
Yes!

546
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:35,600
Because I'm a Tinker! It's who I am!

547
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:40,900
And Tinkers fix things!

548
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:45,000
But I can't do it alone! 

549
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,100
Command us, miss Bell!

550
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:52,000
- I'll help!
- Show us how, Tink!

551
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,100
- I'll help you!
- Me, too!

552
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:58,200
Ok. Gather all the twigs you can, all different sizes!
And tree-saps, we need lots of that!

553
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:04,500
But most importantly, we need to find lost things!

554
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:17,700
- Ok, what have you got?
- How about this?

555
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:21,600
- Will this do?
- Can you use this fuzzy thing, miss Bell?

556
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:24,200
- Oh, yeah!
- It's not fuzzy!

557
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:28,600
- Yes, it is!
- No, it isn't!

558
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:31,100
Twig! Hammer! Magnification, please!

559
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:34,100
Thank you.

560
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:38,700
And that's how you do it.

561
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:42,400
Now what do you suppose that...

562
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:46,900
- Aaa!
- Aaa!

563
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:51,200
- Oh...
- Clunk!

564
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:55,700
You smell funny!

565
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,900
- Oh!
- Uuu!

566
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:03,100
- I saw it first!
- I bumped into it!

567
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:07,400
Let's tie this off here... so you just 
squeeze this.

568
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:11,700
- Then let it go and...
- Aaa!

569
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:16,300
See? Simple!

570
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:20,200
Now, just put the berries in and we'll 
have plenty of paint in no time!

571
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:39,800
We did it!

572
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:59,400
Six, seven and eight.

573
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:10,000
Ohhh!

574
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:59,000
You did it, Tinker Bell! You saved spring!

575
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:02,300
- We all did it.
- Queen Clarion!

576
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:06,400
- Can't Tink come with us to the Mainland?
- Yeah!

577
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:10,800
- She's done so much for everyone!
- No, no, you guys, really!

578
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:15,100
- I don't need to go.
- Buttercup, it's what you wanted.

579
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:19,700
It's ok! My work is here and I still have so 
much to do.

580
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:22,600
- Not here, you don't!
- But I...

581
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:26,300
- No but!
- Surprise, miss Bell!

582
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:30,700
We found your tiny dancer!

583
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:34,000
Actually, I ran across this myself many 
seasons ago!

584
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:38,500
I didn't have a clue what it was or how 
to fix it.

585
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:43,000
You did, Tinker Bell! You are quite a rare 
talent indeed!

586
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:48,000
And I imagine there's a little girl out 
there who's missing this.

587
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:52,500
What do you mean? How...?

588
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:57,700
I think that perhaps a certain Tinker fairy 
might have a job to do afterall.

589
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:01,300
- On the Mainland!
- You mean I...

590
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:07,400
- I knew you can...
- Oh, Tink!

591
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:10,000
- Oh, we can help, miss Bell!
- I'm strong!

592
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,100
- Come on, we got to go right now!
- Thank you, your highness!

593
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:17,100
- But how will I find who it belongs to?
- You'll know!

594
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:21,600
Now, go!

595
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:27,700
Good heavens!

596
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:31,700
Thank you!

597
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:39,200
Tink! Hey! Something to help you on the Mainland!

598
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:44,100
Oh, Terrence, that's so sweet!

599
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:48,000
- Good luck, Tink!
- To the air, fairies!

600
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:52,200
To the air! The Mainland awaits.

601
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:57,600
Come away with me now, to the sky.

602
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:01,600
Up over the hills and the sea,

603
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:05,000
Far beyond, where memories lie,

604
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:09,500
To a place where I'm free to believe!

605
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:17,600
Oh, can you hear them all,

606
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:21,000
No matter what all ye may do?

607
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:25,700
Let the stars fill us all,

608
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:31,000
And the moon craddle the soul,
So to yourself be true!

609
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:40,700
The blanket of snow is all gone,

610
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:46,200
Each flower waits for the sun
And the whispering tears of the rain!

611
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:51,500
Holds a promise for everyone!

612
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:55,500
Then come away with me, friends,

613
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:59,000
No matter where you call your home!

614
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:04,400
With a light in our hearts,
We will never part,

615
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:09,600
- No matter how far we go!
- Fairies to the South! To the East and West!

616
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:26,500
Deep in the forrest we go!

617
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:31,000
- Creatures are all fast asleep!
- Wake up, sleepy heads!

618
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:35,200
With a kiss and a wink, 
we will waken our souls.

619
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:40,700
And always in safety we'll keep.

620
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:45,800
And then, then we'll dance to the light,
Till the sunbeams sparkle at dawn.

621
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:50,000
And away we will go 
Like the last winter snow,

622
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:54,700
Soon our work will be done!

623
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:58,700
Oh, gather ye one and all!

624
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:03,100
No matter what all ye may do!

625
01:07:03,100 --> 01:03:07,100
Let the stars fill your soul
When the moon cradles all!

626
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:11,700
So to yourself be true!

627
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:28,400
Oh, gather ye now one and all,

628
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:32,600
No matter what all ye may do!

629
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:36,600
Let the stars fill us all
And the moon cradles all!

630
01:07:36,700 --> 01:07:41,500
So to yourself be true!

631
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:54,300
So to yourself be true!

632
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,200
Aaa!

633
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:27,400
Aaa!

634
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:54,600
Mommy! Guess what?

635
01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:58,700
- Guess what?
- Yes, Wendy, what is it, darling?

636
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:09,000
A fairy's work is much more than 
at first it might appear!

637
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:13,900
Suppose your broken clock ticks, 
though it hasn't in a year!

638
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:18,200
Perchance you found a toy you lost or 
jingling bells you hear!

639
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:26,100
It all means that one very special fairy...

640
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:30,600
... might be near!
