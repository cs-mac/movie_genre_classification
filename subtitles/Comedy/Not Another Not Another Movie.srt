1
00:00:32,231 --> 00:00:34,632
This is stupid.

2
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:40,004
The whole movie
Is just stupid.

3
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:45,177
Makes perfect sense
Why i'm here.

4
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:47,745
Because this is...

5
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:50,848
Well, i mean,
It's a good part.

6
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,318
I'm directing.

7
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,921
I'm playing a mafia guy.

8
00:00:56,923 --> 00:00:59,924
(imitating the godfather)
I've always wanted to play
A mafia guy.

9
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:01,693
I thought it would
Be very good.

10
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:03,895
You might think
It's a great opportunity,

11
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:06,831
But it's not.

12
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:09,634
You know what?

13
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:11,536
Who cares?

14
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:14,339
Ha! I'll just
Bite my tongue,

15
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:18,810
Think happy thoughts,
And get through this.

16
00:01:20,045 --> 00:01:21,879
Sir, your coffee's
Brewing right...

17
00:01:30,356 --> 00:01:31,956
Who am i kidding?

18
00:01:33,559 --> 00:01:37,229
Sir, it'll be about
Ten more minutes
On the coffee.

19
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:38,796
Mm-hmm.

20
00:01:42,835 --> 00:01:44,636
I'm screwed.

21
00:01:57,916 --> 00:02:01,719
(alarm clock buzzing)

22
00:02:05,858 --> 00:02:08,059
So i have this problem.

23
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:11,129
I have these constant nightmares
Of spoof movies.

24
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,132
Ugh!
It's so frustrating.

25
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,933
I'm totally haunted
By 'em.

26
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:18,403
Plus, i have
This other problem.

27
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:21,273
I get sleepy sometimes,
And i fall asleep.

28
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:23,175
The worst part is,
I never know...

29
00:02:28,514 --> 00:02:29,847
Hey.

30
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:34,752
You were asleep
For a while that time.

31
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:37,355
I'm sorry. I have this...
I know.

32
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:39,658
You have problems.

33
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,626
We all do.

34
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:43,861
I moved to l.A.
Six months ago,

35
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:46,864
And randy was one of
The first friend i made here.

36
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:50,669
He's genuine,
And that's hard to find.

37
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:52,571
I moved here to be
Closer to my family,

38
00:02:52,573 --> 00:02:54,839
And right now, i'm currently
Working with elderly people

39
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,675
At a nursing home.

40
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:59,744
I guess i just wanted to do
Something special with my life.

41
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:01,846
I wanna be
Your boyfriend.

42
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,317
What'd you just say?

43
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:08,086
I said there's not
Enough sugar on this.

44
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:10,422
Let me get
Some more here.

45
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:12,390
You're so silly.

46
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:14,226
She's so great.

47
00:03:14,228 --> 00:03:15,927
So i work in
The entertainment industry...

48
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:18,062
(crash)
Oh!

49
00:03:20,132 --> 00:03:22,066
So i work in
The entertainment industry,

50
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:23,835
And i work for
A great studio.

51
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:25,503
Sunshine studios.

52
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:28,373
They put out some of
The highest-quality films.

53
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,845
Quality might not
Be the word, but completed.

54
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:36,013
They have a lot of
Completed films.

55
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:39,551
But completed films
With a lot of heart.

56
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:42,186
Well, you know,
Maybe not heart,

57
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:45,957
But completed films
That include a running time.

58
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:48,926
Actually, i think
They might be having

59
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:50,328
Real financial problems.

60
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,896
Hey, ben.

61
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,632
My name's actually randy.

62
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:56,033
I don't know
Why the guys call me ben.

63
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:57,535
It's funny though.

64
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:03,841
Okay, take a look
At this gun.

65
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:05,843
All right?
It's totally fake.

66
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:07,445
Is it real?

67
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:09,180
It's totally fake.

68
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:10,848
Okay.

69
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,116
After the blank
Goes off right here,

70
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:14,218
Yeah.
All right?

71
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,887
A blood pack is going
To go off lightly

72
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:17,622
On your leg
Right there.

73
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:19,724
I feel like you're not
Listening to me, randy.

74
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:21,326
Randy, randy.

75
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:22,294
Yeah?
Okay.

76
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:24,362
Did you get that?
Yeah.

77
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:25,497
You're gonna use
Live ammunition.

78
00:04:26,865 --> 00:04:28,065
Which is cool.
Seriously?

79
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:30,535
I'm cool with that.
Seriously?

80
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:32,937
There's nothing to
Be nervous about.
You'll be fine.

81
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,706
Oh, i'm not nervous.
I'm excited.

82
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:37,041
<i>i get to work with
The c.J. Waters.</i>

83
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:38,276
Yeah, whatever.
I'm gonna do this to him.

84
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,878
Watch it, c.J.
Your day has come.

85
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,681
(imitates gunshot)

86
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:44,382
And here it is in slo-mo.

87
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:47,852
(imitating slo-mo voice)
Watch it, c.J.
Your day has come.

88
00:04:59,898 --> 00:05:02,099
So an actor doesn't show up,

89
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:04,569
And some genius here
Decides to put an idiot p.A.

90
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:08,473
In his place because
They wear the same shirt size.

91
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,508
And to think,
A few months ago,

92
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:14,379
I was so excited to work for
A real movie studio.

93
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:16,013
I hate it here.

94
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:19,917
I tell all my friends
I work at target.

95
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,386
Quiet on the set!

96
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:22,587
Quiet!

97
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:24,422
Cameras are rolling.
(bell rings)

98
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:27,759
Sir, can i just say,
It is an honor
To work with you.

99
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:29,361
I want you to shut up.

100
00:05:29,363 --> 00:05:31,596
I loved you in that movie
When you were a cop,

101
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:33,465
And you were on
That missing persons case,

102
00:05:33,467 --> 00:05:35,066
Only it was a lemur
From the zoo.

103
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:36,801
It was a ferret.

104
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:39,337
No, i'm pretty sure
It was a lemur.
I would remember.

105
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,205
It was a drama.

106
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:43,307
Why are you even acting?
You're a p.A., aren't you?

107
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:46,544
In the eighth grade,
I joined troop 1984

108
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:47,912
Of the thespian society,

109
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:49,914
So i'm qualified.
You better be.

110
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,015
Are you ready
To do this?

111
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,717
Man: cue music.

112
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:55,019
You better be!
Action!

113
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:58,956
Give me the information,
Or i'm gonna blow a hole
In your head.

114
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,726
(whispering)
You're doing great.

115
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:04,429
We're still shooting, right?

116
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:05,697
Line!

117
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,365
The line is,

118
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,467
I have a wife
And two kids.

119
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:11,736
It's written
Right over there.
Right? You see it?

120
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:14,439
I don't have
My contacts in.

121
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:15,807
Say it anyway!

122
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:17,842
I have a wife
And two kids.
Say it.

123
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:19,277
Can i run home
And get my contacts?

124
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,478
No!!

125
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,714
I'm sorry.
Stay in character.

126
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,416
I know my terms.

127
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:26,117
All right, ready?
Action!

128
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:28,986
Please don't kill me.
I have a...

129
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:31,122
Let me try it
One more time, okay?

130
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:33,558
Cut. Cut, cut.
(bell rings)

131
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,629
Okay. Can i yell "action"?
No! Action.

132
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:41,132
Please don't kill me.
I have a dog
And three cats.

133
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:43,000
Shut up!
Cut.

134
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:48,005
Please don't kill me.
I am an orphan and have
No food for my widows.

135
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:51,275
Please don't kill me.
I have a wife and...

136
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:53,377
How many kids is it?
I forgot.

137
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:55,547
I hope you don't mind
If i ad-lib a little
Monologue i wrote.

138
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:58,382
I don't know
Where the information is.

139
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:01,052
You can beat it
Out of me if you want,

140
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:03,922
But i won't tell you.
Cue music.

141
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:07,391
Where is the bananas?
That's a joke
I'm working on.

142
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:09,894
That's a cut.
Cut that.

143
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:11,228
And action.

144
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,697
Not yet.
I'll say it.

145
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:14,532
Man: ignore it when
Randy says action.

146
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:15,767
Okay, action.

147
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,702
Action.

148
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:19,737
Please don't kill me.
I have a dog,

149
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:22,406
And he has no home.
He's a stray.

150
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:25,443
That's my cue.
I quit.

151
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:29,514
How about we just
Cut to the part
Where i shoot you?

152
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:30,615
Okay, sure.

153
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,917
I was really excited
For that part anyway.

154
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:35,086
Man: rolling.
Ow.

155
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:36,888
Ow.
Start the music again.

156
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,790
Let me have it.

157
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:41,926
Ow! My leg!

158
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:44,195
Ow! My leg!

159
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:47,765
My leg is shot.
Why did you shoot me?

160
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,367
(screaming continues)

161
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,070
Please, god,
Don't kill me.

162
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:55,039
Is that where
It hurts?

163
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:58,476
C.J. Waters, please.
I don't wanna die.

164
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:02,814
Don't say my name.
My character's name is allen.
Now do it again.

165
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:04,348
Okay, i'm sorry.
Allen.

166
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:08,953
Allen, i am in need
Of medical assistance, please.

167
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:12,356
Please call 911.

168
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:16,027
Please don't kill me.

169
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:22,166
He shot...

170
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:25,570
Quit shooting me
And trying to kill me.

171
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:30,808
Oh, my god. There were
Real bullets in the gun?

172
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:33,177
I wonder
How that happened.

173
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:40,117
Why did you shoot me?
Why did you shoot me?

174
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:43,521
Cue music.
Look, do you...

175
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:47,091
Get away from me!
Get away.

176
00:08:48,894 --> 00:08:52,396
I'm sorry. I thought
This was blanks.

177
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:54,632
Well, it's not blanks.
It's not blanks at all.

178
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:03,875
You used to be
My favorite.

179
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,843
That's a cut.

180
00:09:24,429 --> 00:09:26,631
I got two more
On your six.

181
00:09:28,533 --> 00:09:31,202
Three o'clock.
Three o'clock.

182
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:38,776
Down, down, down.

183
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:42,080
Bulldog three to greyhound six.
We have reached our objective.

184
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:44,281
<i>this is greyhound six.
What is your position?</i>

185
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:45,950
<i>bulldog three. Over.</i>

186
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:47,451
We are under heavy fire.

187
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:49,687
<i>we're on our way,
Bulldog three. Out.</i>

188
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,465
Uh, guys,
We're rolling.

189
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:02,500
Cut!

190
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:04,168
Oh, come on!
Shit!

191
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,070
Can someone get me
An iced tea, please?

192
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:07,605
What is with
The helmet?

193
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,774
You're taking me
Out of my character.

194
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:13,210
Cut! Damn it, ben.

195
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:15,046
That's the fifth
Time today.

196
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:16,580
I'm doing paperwork.

197
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:18,415
So they let me try out
The acting thing.

198
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:20,985
We found out that
I wasn't "cut out" for it,

199
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:23,420
Which is okay,
Because i'm back to
Doing what i love,

200
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:25,857
Being a production
Assistant again.

201
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:27,625
I'm working on
My lifelong project,

202
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,962
Which is a screenplay
About a small boy

203
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:35,366
And my, or his, tricycle,
Who was abused.

204
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,835
It's a drama.

205
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:42,640
<i>titanic 2: the ghost story.
Take 19. Marker.</i>

206
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:46,610
My name's wes.
I am the head director,

207
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:48,813
(scoffs)
Good director,

208
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:51,849
Of all of sunshine
Studio's films ever since
C.J. Waters quit,

209
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:54,585
And we're working on
An exciting project right now.

210
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:57,321
This is big, okay?
It's a sequel,

211
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:00,091
And it's got everything in it,
Everything you wanna see.

212
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:03,127
We've got romance,
A war, the mafia, ghosts.

213
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:05,262
What's not to like, huh?

214
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:07,098
This is gonna be huge, okay?

215
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,201
Mark my words. Big numbers.
You can quote me on that.

216
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:12,870
Jack, is that you again?

217
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:15,639
I'm reading.
Don't you see i'm reading?

218
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:17,709
Why don't you
Leave me alone?

219
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:20,178
You died years ago
On that boat,

220
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,680
And it was
A beautiful night...

221
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,548
I love you.

222
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:29,020
(shivering)
I love you, too.

223
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,922
Jack.
Yeah?

224
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:34,125
Do you think we're
Gonna be okay?

225
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:37,561
Man: please help us.
We're all gonna die out here.

226
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:39,430
Yeah. We're gonna
Be just fine.

227
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:42,700
We just have to
Hold on to hope.

228
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:46,237
Man: no hope.
We're all gonna die out here.

229
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:48,405
Okay. Just never let go.

230
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:51,042
Okay? Promise you'll
Never let go.

231
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,811
I won't. Promise me
You'll never let go.

232
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:56,748
I promise.

233
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,315
Promise me you'll
Follow your dreams.

234
00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:00,317
I promise.

235
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:02,220
John...

236
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:05,556
Especially the dream
That you become a nun
And never marry again.

237
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:09,293
Um, no. That's
Not my dream.

238
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:11,562
Just promise me, rose.
I'm dying here.

239
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,931
Okay. No, i promise.

240
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:17,301
Promise me you'll never
Kiss another man.

241
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:19,971
Um... Mmm.

242
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:21,472
I am only 18.

243
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,407
I have to go to college.

244
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,911
Gonna be in sorority.
I have big plans,
So i don't know.

245
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:30,481
If you feel like
That you need to let go,

246
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:32,616
I forgive you.

247
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:34,685
Okay?
You do?

248
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:38,322
Okay.
So i forgive you.

249
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:40,391
You need to let go.
What are you doing?

250
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:41,659
Man: is there anybody
Out there?

251
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:44,461
Who is that?
Anyone?

252
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:46,497
Who is that?

253
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:48,499
Is that a lifeboat?

254
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:51,002
No. It's okay,
Don't worry.

255
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:54,238
I'll be fine, okay?
Just let go.

256
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,473
I'm so cold and...

257
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:59,777
Man: i'm all alone.
I need some company.

258
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:03,347
I've got, like,
12 seats in here.

259
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:06,083
Are you sure there's
Not enough room on
That driftwood for me?

260
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:10,354
Hm-mm. No. I wish there was,
But i'm a little cramped.

261
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:11,823
You could save
Both of us.

262
00:13:11,825 --> 00:13:14,758
I'm starting to lose
My power of sight.

263
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,028
I can't... Is he
Still out there?

264
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,429
Hey, you.

265
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:20,397
Jump in my boat.
I've got plenty of room.

266
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:25,002
Hm-mm. Nope.
Oh, he's gone.

267
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:26,403
I got hot cocoa.

268
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:29,406
(crying)

269
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:32,009
Lose the stiff.
I'm back in five.

270
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:33,777
I'm so cold, rose.

271
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:36,580
I know. I'm
A little chilly, too.

272
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:38,716
I wish there
Was room.

273
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:40,151
Hey, you know what?

274
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,986
Let me get you
A sweater.

275
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:43,754
I got a sweater, okay?

276
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:49,426
Ooh.

277
00:13:56,534 --> 00:13:58,302
Got my sweater all...

278
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:00,004
It's so nice.

279
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:04,842
I am so hot.

280
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,810
Actually, this is
Really hot.

281
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:08,045
(snorts)

282
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:11,115
That beautiful night,
And the moon and everything.

283
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:15,186
But you can't swim,
And there wasn't
Room for you on the boat.

284
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:18,189
That's what i have to do.

285
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,556
I mean, it's getting...

286
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:21,692
Come on, jack,
Where are you?

287
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,460
I'm gonna
Get you, jack.

288
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:24,962
Oh, this thing
Won't work.

289
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:26,530
Cut. Cut. Cut!

290
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:27,932
What? What?
What do you want?

291
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:29,867
Hi.
Hi.

292
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,335
How you doin'
Over there?

293
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:33,271
I'm not doing
Well at all.

294
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:36,173
I can tell that.
Listen, do you need
A nap or something?

295
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:37,608
No, i don't need
Any nap!

296
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,777
I'm just not strong
Enough to cock it.

297
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:42,579
Did you just decide
To waste everyone's
Time today?

298
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:43,948
Was it
A conscious decision?

299
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,783
How dare you
Talk to me like that?

300
00:14:45,785 --> 00:14:47,785
Because this is how
You cock a gun.

301
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:50,154
You see that? Just like that.
Is that close enough for you?

302
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:52,556
I can't do it
When it's not my size.

303
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:55,092
You have to get me a gun
That's right for me.

304
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:57,494
Not your size?
You're the size
Of a peanut.

305
00:14:57,496 --> 00:14:59,030
This is the size
Of a shotgun.

306
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:01,865
That's how you cock a gun.
I've told you ten times.

307
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:05,436
<i>you know what?
Titanic has one anchor.
We don't need two.</i>

308
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:08,105
Oh, really?
Yes.

309
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:10,141
You like that?
Let's give you
A little bit more.

310
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:13,610
I'm sorry you can't
C-c-cock the gun,
But you're f-f-fired!

311
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:17,281
Thank you. It'll be
A good thing to get
Rid of you anyway.

312
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:19,883
I'm glad. Bye, bye, bye.

313
00:15:23,288 --> 00:15:27,391
Guys, we gotta talk.

314
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:30,061
Oh. Oh, boy.

315
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:31,262
I, uh...

316
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:33,497
I'm afraid i, uh...

317
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:35,066
I have horrible news
For all of you.

318
00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:38,469
You're all gonna be
Looking for another job.

319
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:42,406
In a nutshell,
The movie that we made

320
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:44,208
That we hoped
Would make money,

321
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,810
Came out and...

322
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:49,947
We didn't make zero.

323
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,149
I know that sounds
Pretty good,

324
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:53,684
But it's actually
Bad news,

325
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:57,088
Because we ended up
Owing money.

326
00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:00,458
You see, shipping costs,

327
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,693
And the print costs,

328
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:05,096
Put us in a position
Where we owe

329
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:07,198
More than
It actually made.

330
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,233
I wish we made zero.
Believe me.

331
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:10,534
(cell phone
Ring tone playing)

332
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:11,869
Excuse me one second.

333
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:14,438
(ring tone playing
Rap song)

334
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,307
Yes?

335
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,175
I'm in an important meeting.

336
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:19,977
Please.

337
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,213
<i>man: mr. Storm, you wanna
Look out the window, please?</i>

338
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:25,582
Mm-hmm.
Okey-dokey.

339
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:34,258
<i>sir, we're all over here.
Yeah. Uh-huh.</i>

340
00:16:37,962 --> 00:16:40,231
<i>okay. See you over here.</i>

341
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:41,732
Went to the wrong office
Again, didn't i?

342
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:43,700
I'll be right there.
Yeah.

343
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:46,170
Keep up the good work. Bye.

344
00:16:47,605 --> 00:16:49,206
Flop!

345
00:16:50,475 --> 00:16:52,443
Great job, wes.

346
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:55,746
Everybody take a moment
And give wes

347
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:57,448
A big round of applause
For shitting on our studio.

348
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:00,484
You know what? Actually,
To be fair, it was steve's idea.

349
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:02,786
Was it? The shitting
On the studio part?

350
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:06,857
Was it your idea, steve?
Did you direct it, steve?
Who directed it, steve?

351
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,126
I believe
It was wes, yes.

352
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:11,028
Hey, let's take a look
At your projection.

353
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,730
By the way, i remember
We were talking about
This before.

354
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:16,333
This is what
He projected for
The opening weekend.

355
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:18,635
I love these numbers.
These are great numbers.
Look at this.

356
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:20,171
Whoo whoo whoo whoo whooo!

357
00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:22,639
Now, what the film
Actually did was...

358
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:24,041
(clears throat)

359
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:27,010
...A little worse.
Perhaps like this.

360
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:29,313
You know what i'm saying?
You know what i'm saying, wes?

361
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:31,182
Wes: i'm expecting
Big things--

362
00:17:31,184 --> 00:17:33,184
Wes, i really don't
Wanna hear you talk.

363
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:37,354
I just wanna thank you
So much for begging me

364
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:38,822
To let you
Direct this film,

365
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:42,693
Because we just lost
$55 million.

366
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:44,695
And of course,
We're gonna need
You to pay that back.

367
00:17:44,697 --> 00:17:47,965
I don't have
That kind of money.

368
00:17:47,967 --> 00:17:50,167
We'll take it
Out of your paycheck.

369
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:53,070
Shouldn't take that long.
Write that down, ben.
Ben, ben?

370
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:56,073
Take it out of his paycheck.
Shouldn't take too long.

371
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:59,143
People, we gotta
Start over.

372
00:17:59,145 --> 00:18:00,877
We gotta
Get back to basics.

373
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:03,080
What makes a good film,
A good movie?

374
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,349
The script.
Craft services.

375
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:07,551
Paris hilton?
Cream.

376
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:10,154
Ice. Vanilla extract.

377
00:18:11,656 --> 00:18:13,557
It's true. Why?

378
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:17,094
Because that's what's
Payin' for the movies.

379
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:21,665
I started making ice cream
In the late 1970's.

380
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,967
And that's where
All my fame and fortune,

381
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:26,003
That's where it came from.

382
00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:29,840
My company was called
30 flavors.

383
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:32,776
No one could even imagine
Back then.

384
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,346
Thirty flavors of ice cream.

385
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:36,847
(laughing)

386
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:41,852
That's when robbins
Came up with 31.

387
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:47,124
So i... I had
To call it quits.

388
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:50,461
You know,
Open a movie studio.

389
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,530
Rum raisin. Ech!

390
00:18:52,532 --> 00:18:55,466
(scoffs)
Why couldn't
I have thought of that?

391
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,067
I'll tell you why.

392
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:59,570
You don't want
To give a kid liquor

393
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:00,871
With raisins in it.

394
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:02,873
What... What's that
Teaching us?

395
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,741
What's that teaching us?
What's that teaching our kids?

396
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:07,944
I even tried it.
I tried drinking rum,

397
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:10,414
Put raisins in it,
It's hideous.

398
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,349
Can you imagine freezing
That up, putting it on a cone,

399
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:14,251
And havin' a kid...

400
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:18,021
What? What? What? What?
I'm sorry.

401
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:20,157
First things first.

402
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,427
I will be leaving
My little brother lester,

403
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:26,564
Who i don't think
Many of you have met yet,

404
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:28,699
Will be taking over
For me.

405
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:31,168
I think dad would've
Liked it that way anyway.

406
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,270
He's a terrific guy.
I know you're gonna like him.

407
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:35,539
He is kind-hearted,
He's sweet.

408
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,174
He's like a puppy dog.

409
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,443
You could tickle him
On the chest.

410
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:42,946
He's like a pussycat,
But he's also conscientious.

411
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:45,082
I think he'll have
More of the temperament

412
00:19:45,084 --> 00:19:47,685
For this kind of work
Than i do.

413
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:51,855
I am having a problem
Keeping my heart beating.

414
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:55,593
Therefore, without
Any further ado,
I'll be taking my leave,

415
00:19:55,595 --> 00:20:00,030
And introducing you
To my little brother
Lester. Hang ten.

416
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,466
Run a tighter ship.
(all murmuring)

417
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:10,307
(snorting inhalation)

418
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:12,243
I'd like to thank
My big brother

419
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:15,512
For giving me
This opportunity.
Thanks, bro.

420
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:20,016
I do understand
That you're havin' a problem.

421
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:22,753
So he sent me here
To take care of business.

422
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:27,791
Apparently, there's been
Some problems with, uh...

423
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:29,426
Your films.

424
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:35,232
I need to understand
What's goin' on around here.

425
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,968
He seems nice.
Totally.

426
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,304
I guess one thing
He didn't tell you

427
00:20:40,306 --> 00:20:42,072
Was that i just
Got let out of prison.

428
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:46,243
I was in prison
For killing some people.

429
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:49,513
I slaughtered
A whole family.

430
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:56,520
He probably told you that
You could scratch my tummy.

431
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:01,725
He mentioned it.

432
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:03,994
But that ain't gonna happen.

433
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:05,729
Because all these pictures
That you make,

434
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:07,264
And they just keep tankin',

435
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,966
And that's really
Burnin' my ass.

436
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:13,570
I'm here to find out
What you're gonna do about it.

437
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:19,576
Boom, i got one! Okay?
Buddy flick. Road trip, right?
Everybody likes road trips.

438
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:21,345
All of a sudden,
We're gonna have campfires.

439
00:21:21,347 --> 00:21:23,146
There's water skis,
There's boobs,

440
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:24,948
And then a hurricane comes,
Spins everybody around.

441
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,317
Everybody's, like,
We're gonna die.

442
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:28,485
I haven't paid back
My student loans.

443
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:31,054
Slam, right into
The middle of the desert.

444
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:34,491
Only thing to eat,
Low-fat yogurt.

445
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:36,159
Let's see it.

446
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:38,128
We didn't get
A chance to make it.

447
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:42,165
But we made something
Much better. I'm sure
You're gonna like it a lot.

448
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:44,401
Yeah.
It's much better
Than his...

449
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:49,139
Let me see how you look
With this hat on.

450
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,342
I think you look
Kinda cute there.

451
00:21:51,344 --> 00:21:54,845
Wanna try on my glasses?
No.

452
00:21:54,847 --> 00:21:58,582
I want my hat back.
You can have it.
It's all yours.

453
00:21:58,584 --> 00:22:01,585
<i>i can't believe
You ever dated him.
He's such a pig.</i>

454
00:22:01,587 --> 00:22:05,522
<i>aren't all men?
They're such pigs.</i>

455
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:07,190
<i>i know.</i>

456
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:11,462
That one has green hair.
No one has green hair.

457
00:22:11,464 --> 00:22:14,297
<i>come on, cheryl.
Say something.</i>

458
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:16,333
<i>i'm on my period.
I'm grouchy.
I don't wanna talk.</i>

459
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,335
Why the fuck did you
Let them do that to you?

460
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,537
I was ganged up on
By a group of girls.

461
00:22:22,907 --> 00:22:25,075
Why?

462
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:27,244
You didn't get
To see the whole thing.

463
00:22:27,246 --> 00:22:32,048
And you need
Some new shoes, my dear.

464
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,717
He didn't get to see it all.

465
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:36,420
I know we were gonna do
That stupid road trip thing,

466
00:22:36,422 --> 00:22:38,489
But i mean, he was late,
(toilet flushes)

467
00:22:38,491 --> 00:22:41,124
So i took matters
Into my own hands.

468
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:42,493
It's what anyone would do.

469
00:22:42,495 --> 00:22:46,497
I don't know
What his problem is.

470
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:49,633
Shit, wes,
Light a match! Oh!

471
00:22:49,635 --> 00:22:51,602
Five minutes.
I've heard enough.

472
00:22:51,604 --> 00:22:54,938
I was five minutes late,
She's going on... Wah, wah, wah.

473
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,908
Let's get honest here.
I'm trying to work on
Some concepts.

474
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:00,711
<i>air bud meets days of thunder.
That's real stuff.</i>

475
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:04,981
Dress me up as some dude-chick
Hybrid in your terrible movie...

476
00:23:04,983 --> 00:23:07,518
God. Still hit that though.

477
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,454
I'd like to hear
From somebody else.

478
00:23:10,456 --> 00:23:14,057
(speaking spanish)

479
00:23:22,133 --> 00:23:23,867
They don't speak english.

480
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:26,269
I realize that.

481
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:28,305
We keep trying
To fire 'em,

482
00:23:28,307 --> 00:23:30,040
But they keep
Showin' up anyway.

483
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:33,009
(speaking spanish)

484
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:34,545
Let's see it.

485
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:39,416
(narrator speaking spanish)

486
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:42,118
<i>¿por que, jesus, por que?</i>

487
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:47,223
(spanish narration
Continues)

488
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:17,988
<i>you're fired.
Gracias, señor.</i>

489
00:24:20,191 --> 00:24:21,892
<i>while they were making
Titanic 2,</i>

490
00:24:21,894 --> 00:24:25,128
Myself and brian
Wrote a screenplay,

491
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,964
And we put together
A nice little script,

492
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:29,165
And we got tom hanks
Attached.

493
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:31,602
Tom hanks?

494
00:24:31,604 --> 00:24:33,003
It's the biggest name
Sunshine has ever...

495
00:24:33,005 --> 00:24:34,571
Tom hanks?
Yeah.

496
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:37,641
It's about the life
Of albert einstein.

497
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:39,576
We got exclusive rights
To the story.

498
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:42,412
It's about his life, and it
Delves into his personal past,

499
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:45,348
And his struggles
Trying to come up with
The theory of relativity.

500
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:48,118
You mean the mc-squared thing?

501
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,020
Right. Exactly.

502
00:24:50,022 --> 00:24:52,923
But what about his hair?

503
00:24:52,925 --> 00:24:57,160
I can make my hair
Like albert einstein. Look.

504
00:24:57,162 --> 00:25:00,731
I'm albert einstein.
Sunshine studio...

505
00:25:00,733 --> 00:25:03,166
I know the theory
Of relativity.

506
00:25:04,702 --> 00:25:08,138
It's official, man.
Our boss is insane.

507
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:11,975
I think we should
Take our script to sony.

508
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:13,777
Let me give you
Something, sir.

509
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:15,478
I think you're really
Gonna like this.

510
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,614
What's the most popular
Film genre?

511
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:20,483
It's gotta be
Martial arts, right?

512
00:25:20,485 --> 00:25:24,187
And what's the most popular
Martial arts movie of all time?

513
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,989
<i>man: kill bill.</i>

514
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:29,426
<i>yes, kill bill is definitely...
Right behind that is ninja.</i>

515
00:25:29,428 --> 00:25:35,365
<i>and after that,
The third most popular
Is the prequel kid ninja.</i>

516
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:38,702
I'm gonna give you guys
Something that's never
Been done before.

517
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:41,538
The prequel to the prequel.
Let's see it.

518
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:49,079
<i>where are the diamonds?
In my diaper.</i>

519
00:25:49,081 --> 00:25:53,416
<i>well, give them back.
You'll have to
Fight me for them.</i>

520
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:57,621
(sounds of fighting)

521
00:25:57,623 --> 00:25:59,289
<i>counter punch.</i>

522
00:26:00,658 --> 00:26:02,893
You know that you can
See their hands.

523
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:05,161
Not exactly,
But close.

524
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:06,964
Thanks, steve.

525
00:26:06,966 --> 00:26:08,999
(stammering)
Babies can't stand
On their own.

526
00:26:09,001 --> 00:26:12,435
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever seen in my life.

527
00:26:12,437 --> 00:26:14,638
It was steve's idea.
You gonna blame it on him now?

528
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,041
If you just play
The rest of it,
You'll see...

529
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:21,177
<i>uh, baby's crying.</i>

530
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:23,647
(groaning)

531
00:26:23,649 --> 00:26:26,549
How come people
Don't like my ideas?

532
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:29,252
<i>the reviewer said
Titanic 2: the ghost story</i>

533
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,387
Didn't make sense.

534
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:34,390
It's a love story
On a haunted luxury liner

535
00:26:34,392 --> 00:26:36,126
That's hijacked
By the mafia

536
00:26:36,128 --> 00:26:37,861
In the middle of
An iraqi war zone.

537
00:26:37,863 --> 00:26:39,997
What part of that
Does not make sense?

538
00:26:39,999 --> 00:26:43,734
Here's what i'm
Gonna do now, okay?

539
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:53,309
Whoo!

540
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:56,747
Improv.
Oh, okay.

541
00:26:56,749 --> 00:27:00,550
I need somebody
To write a script.

542
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:02,285
Anyone.

543
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,820
Anyone in here.

544
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:07,190
I don't care if
You're the fucking janitor.

545
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:09,225
If you don't bring it to me...

546
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:12,629
I'm going to start
Firing this weapon.

547
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:16,299
I'm out!
(all clamoring)

548
00:27:18,369 --> 00:27:21,071
He just said anyone.

549
00:27:21,073 --> 00:27:22,973
I'm an anyone.

550
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:25,876
Ding dong.
Idea at the door.

551
00:27:25,878 --> 00:27:27,610
A fat guy
Wanders into a zoo,

552
00:27:27,612 --> 00:27:29,646
Loses his friggin' wallet,
Doesn't know where it is.

553
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:32,716
A gorilla picks it up
Who has an innate ability
To count.

554
00:27:32,718 --> 00:27:35,152
What's this?
A second climax?

555
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:39,056
All of a sudden,
He realizes animals
Have feelings, too.

556
00:27:39,058 --> 00:27:41,491
I'm taking speech classes
At a community college.

557
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,959
I'm trying to further
Myself right now.

558
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:45,628
I got 64 credit hours
Under my belt.

559
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:47,463
But i'm an idea hamster.

560
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:49,766
I never stop
Generating ideas.

561
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:52,769
If you're gonna be a bear,
Be a grizzly.

562
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:54,537
Right now, i'm workin' on
My "hot words."

563
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:57,574
That's including but not
Limited to boom, bam,

564
00:27:57,576 --> 00:27:59,876
What up, listen up,
Here comes the mother ship,

565
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:02,813
Shotgun blast, you know.
They're attention grabbers.

566
00:28:02,815 --> 00:28:05,816
People are responding,
They build confidence,
They build energy.

567
00:28:05,818 --> 00:28:07,584
Doesn't even matter
What you're sayin'.

568
00:28:07,586 --> 00:28:10,553
Ooh, hop on the pain train
On this one.

569
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:13,123
Check this out.
Idea at the door. Ding dong.

570
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:15,092
(makes buzzing sound)

571
00:28:15,094 --> 00:28:17,360
(making pinging sounds)

572
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,562
One ping, and one ping only.

573
00:28:19,564 --> 00:28:21,698
Periscope up.
We found the friggin' idea.

574
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,900
I hate the sound
Of his voice.

575
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:26,069
Reminds me of the sound
Your body makes

576
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:27,670
When you try to
Hold in a fart.

577
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:30,506
Hello. Hello.
Hey, sleepyhead,
You ignoring me?

578
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:32,609
This is an $85 shirt.

579
00:28:32,611 --> 00:28:34,410
Let's not forget
What tupac told us.

580
00:28:34,412 --> 00:28:36,947
Tryin' to make a dollar
Out of 15 cents here.

581
00:28:36,949 --> 00:28:39,916
Boom, boom.
That was loaded.
Put that away.

582
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:42,085
I'm pretty sure
She's into my ideas.

583
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:44,454
Like, she knows
A good man when she sees one.

584
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:46,790
Right now, i know that i'm
Gettin' those looks from her.

585
00:28:46,792 --> 00:28:50,260
I'm gettin' those,
"hey, what's up on
A late-night mistake" look.

586
00:28:50,262 --> 00:28:53,630
And that's the way she operates.
I know how she is.

587
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:56,566
She said "what up?" earlier
Over at the potato salad
In the break room.

588
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:59,002
I catch her lookin'
All the doggone time.

589
00:29:07,211 --> 00:29:09,445
Remember to smile, randy.

590
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:11,614
Oh, hey, wendy.

591
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:13,716
You ready for
Poetry club?

592
00:29:13,718 --> 00:29:17,053
I have this neighbor,
And her name's wendy,

593
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:19,022
And she's kinda wonderful.

594
00:29:19,024 --> 00:29:24,161
But i can never tell her.
I'm way too insecure.

595
00:29:24,163 --> 00:29:27,931
I'm damaged goods,
If you know what i mean.

596
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:30,733
I think i like you, wendy.
Love you, really.

597
00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:33,069
Matter of fact,
I love you a lot
Since i met you,

598
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:36,173
And i wanna have
Babies with you.
A lot of babies.

599
00:29:36,175 --> 00:29:38,108
Like, quintuplets.

600
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:40,643
She does not have a clue.

601
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:43,246
I'm pretty good
At hiding my feelings.

602
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:45,182
This is
My grandma's ring.

603
00:29:45,184 --> 00:29:49,385
I was wondering if maybe
You'd wear it on
Your finger forever.

604
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:52,255
And okay,
You can turn around now.

605
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:53,990
You don't
Want to.

606
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:56,626
It was a stupid idea.
You hate it, you hate me.

607
00:29:56,628 --> 00:30:00,330
I'm sorry.
Sorry to upset you.

608
00:30:00,332 --> 00:30:03,900
You don't have to give me
The silent treatment, though.

609
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:06,870
I mean, two can
Play at that game.

610
00:30:06,872 --> 00:30:09,072
No, they can't.

611
00:30:09,074 --> 00:30:12,042
(whispering)
Why did she do that?
I'm so stupid.

612
00:30:12,044 --> 00:30:15,545
She's so pretty.
Oh, great,
I'm evicted.

613
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:18,681
I'm evicted.

614
00:30:18,683 --> 00:30:20,717
Randy?
Did you hear me?
I'm evicted.

615
00:30:20,719 --> 00:30:22,552
Did you say something?

616
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:26,223
Oh, you had
Headphones on.

617
00:30:26,225 --> 00:30:28,058
Oh, thank god.

618
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:31,461
I have those ipod ones,
And you can't hear a thing.

619
00:30:31,463 --> 00:30:34,064
What are you doing?

620
00:30:34,066 --> 00:30:36,032
I was just
Lockin' up.

621
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:38,168
I'm neurotic,
So i gotta lock it
Like, 50 times.

622
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:42,973
<i>i'm like jack nicholson
In as good as it gets.
"step over the crack."</i>

623
00:30:42,975 --> 00:30:45,075
Are you okay?
I'm okay.
I'm totally okay.

624
00:30:45,077 --> 00:30:48,578
Look, i got a present.
An eviction notice. Ready?

625
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:54,050
I can't wait to hear
All the poems today.

626
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:56,286
I love poems.

627
00:30:56,288 --> 00:30:58,255
I know you do.

628
00:30:58,257 --> 00:31:02,859
I don't think randy
Actually knows what a poem is.

629
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:06,429
I truly believe
He thinks he does.
But he's trying, though.

630
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:11,134
This is... This is
A totally original poem.

631
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:18,275
"i am black,
Grew up in the hood,

632
00:31:18,277 --> 00:31:20,310
"have no parents,
Shot by cops,

633
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:24,381
"bling bling, blang blang,
Bling bling, bust a cap,
Bust a cap, bust a cap.

634
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:26,682
"sixteen years old
And never found love,

635
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:32,222
"speak in rap,
Wanna fly like a dove
Up above the clouds.

636
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:34,624
The clouds."

637
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:38,361
Some people think they can
Do the spoken word.

638
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:40,563
A bit of times,
It does come out

639
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,999
Like verbal diarrhea
Of the mouth.

640
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:46,903
"the clouds calls rain..."
Wait, i'm sorry.

641
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,105
That's okay. We understood
Where you were going.

642
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:54,777
I am the head of
Poetry survivors.

643
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:57,113
There are some dues
That we do have to pay.

644
00:31:57,115 --> 00:32:02,485
Each member has to pay
A small fee of $1,500 a week.

645
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:04,887
I know it seems hefty,
But it covers

646
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:08,291
Quite a few different aspects,
For one, my rent.

647
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:13,263
Um... And if i'm homeless,
I certainly can't hold up
A theater group.

648
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:15,932
So here at
This poetry club,

649
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:20,636
We are trying
To showcase
Original works.

650
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:22,538
It's a policy.

651
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:25,008
Was that yours?
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

652
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:29,279
Really? About being
Black and 16?

653
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:30,913
Dut-dut-dut-dut-dut.

654
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:33,316
Are you sure
It was yours?

655
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:36,052
Well, uh, no.
Not all of it.

656
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:39,990
But the dut-dut.
I'm sorry. I found it
On the internet.

657
00:32:39,992 --> 00:32:41,891
Okay. Okay.

658
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:43,826
But i can read my script
If you like.

659
00:32:43,828 --> 00:32:46,429
No, no.
That's okay.

660
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:48,664
Maybe next week.

661
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:50,700
Randy always wants
To read his script.

662
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:52,635
He gets so into it.
I hate it.

663
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:58,908
He assigns everybody parts,
And it's so long and boring.

664
00:33:00,978 --> 00:33:04,647
Looks like you and randy
Have been going out a lot.

665
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,883
Yeah, i guess so.
Yeah. That's great.

666
00:33:06,885 --> 00:33:10,453
I mean, he's got a lot
Of great qualities.

667
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:12,722
He... He's a guy.

668
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:14,491
He's a great guy.

669
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:16,859
What exactly
Do you see in him?

670
00:33:16,861 --> 00:33:21,131
Look, i know
He's not perfect,
But neither am i.

671
00:33:21,133 --> 00:33:23,799
Do you know what he does
Every morning?

672
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:26,869
I don't know. Copy down
Shakespeare and call it
His own?

673
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:29,705
He goes to
His grandma's
At the nursing home.

674
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:34,244
And she has alzheimer's.
She wouldn't even know
If he came or not.

675
00:33:34,246 --> 00:33:36,513
But he goes every day.

676
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:39,249
That's why he wants
To be a screenwriter,
You know.

677
00:33:39,251 --> 00:33:41,617
So he can make
Lots of money
And be able

678
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:44,120
To take care of her
The proper way.

679
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:47,023
There's not a lot
Of guys left like that
In the world.

680
00:33:48,625 --> 00:33:51,261
Oh, my god.
I'm such a bitch.

681
00:33:51,263 --> 00:33:53,629
I mean, i had no idea.

682
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:55,765
I... I totally thought
He was kind of an idiot,

683
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:57,967
But i was so wrong.

684
00:33:57,969 --> 00:34:02,038
Hey, randy.
Are you getting sleepy?

685
00:34:09,113 --> 00:34:11,147
Hey, ben.

686
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:18,421
Ben! The guys have been
Having a great time
Here at work.

687
00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:22,825
They've been calling me ben,
Which i just think is so funny.

688
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:24,961
Ben, damn it, ben!
Benjamin! Ben!

689
00:34:24,963 --> 00:34:28,931
Ben, where is
My coffee, ben?
Ben.

690
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:31,101
They have
This good one, right?

691
00:34:31,103 --> 00:34:33,769
They made out
My paycheck to ben,

692
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:36,106
Which is just
So hilarious.

693
00:34:36,108 --> 00:34:38,541
I tried to explain that
To the bank.

694
00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:40,343
They didn't get it,

695
00:34:40,345 --> 00:34:44,280
Which is a serious problem,
Because i can't pay my rent now.

696
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:46,649
"ben."

697
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:48,585
Did you just eat that?

698
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:50,820
Yeah.

699
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:55,391
My name's ernie.

700
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:57,494
I'm 38 years young,

701
00:34:57,496 --> 00:35:01,831
And i'm a production assistant
Here with randy,

702
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:03,699
Which is great.

703
00:35:03,701 --> 00:35:07,870
It's always been my dream
To become a production
Assistant.

704
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:10,507
Some people
Like to dream high.

705
00:35:10,509 --> 00:35:15,211
But if you set
Your goals too high,
You might not ever reach 'em.

706
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:20,082
The shitter's
Clogged again.

707
00:35:20,084 --> 00:35:23,719
Um, apparently, target
Was looking for someone

708
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:26,189
With more "people skills."

709
00:35:27,324 --> 00:35:29,259
I would've killed
For that job.

710
00:35:31,828 --> 00:35:34,930
Don't worry about it, man.
I'll take care of it
For you, okay?

711
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:37,667
You just,
You know, relax.

712
00:35:39,703 --> 00:35:42,405
I have a very weak stomach.

713
00:35:42,407 --> 00:35:47,043
I can't really do
The toilets or sometimes,

714
00:35:47,045 --> 00:35:50,647
Take out the trash,
'cause i'll gag sometimes.

715
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:53,283
Usually always.

716
00:35:53,285 --> 00:35:58,120
That and fish filets
From mcdonald's.

717
00:35:58,122 --> 00:36:00,356
It's something
With the sauce.

718
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:04,394
It's like the white
And the green.

719
00:36:04,396 --> 00:36:07,397
Just thinkin' about it
Makes me wanna...

720
00:36:07,399 --> 00:36:09,632
I can't even think
About fish.

721
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:12,435
It just...
Sorry.

722
00:36:15,639 --> 00:36:17,873
Sorry. I have
These nightmares.

723
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:19,609
I know we were
Doin' this interview.

724
00:36:19,611 --> 00:36:22,645
I dream of these spoof movies
All the time,

725
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:25,081
And i hate it.

726
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:27,083
I don't know
Where it comes from.

727
00:36:27,085 --> 00:36:29,319
Maybe my childhood.
Maybe a...

728
00:36:34,057 --> 00:36:37,227
<i>you have to love
Naked gun.</i>

729
00:36:37,229 --> 00:36:39,429
Why aren't you laughin'?
Laugh!

730
00:36:39,431 --> 00:36:42,665
Dad, it was funny
The first few hundred
Times we watched it.

731
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:44,667
What if we watch
Something else?

732
00:36:44,669 --> 00:36:49,572
<i>that's a great idea. What about
Naked gun 33 1/3, huh?</i>

733
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:52,074
How about
I get the popcorn?

734
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:53,943
You stay there.
I'll get it.

735
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:56,212
Okay, dad.
Oh, man.

736
00:37:03,687 --> 00:37:05,855
Thanks, man.

737
00:37:05,857 --> 00:37:09,792
It's just, last time,
I started throwin' up
When i tried to fix it.

738
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:11,361
No biggie, man.
I understand.

739
00:37:12,696 --> 00:37:14,830
I owe you big time.

740
00:37:16,099 --> 00:37:19,269
Is it bad in there?
You have no idea.

741
00:37:19,271 --> 00:37:22,905
Overall, my lifelong
Dream and goal

742
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:27,910
Is to find and marry
And settle down with
A beautiful woman.

743
00:37:29,713 --> 00:37:31,281
He's not comin'.

744
00:37:31,283 --> 00:37:33,549
If he isn't,
I'm in charge.
Right, wes.

745
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:35,985
You see the way
He was acting?
He was looking for

746
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:37,487
Any reason to punch
Someone on their ass.

747
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:39,922
You know what?
Steve's in charge.
No, i'm good.

748
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:43,125
So do you guys think
That was a real gun
He was packin'?

749
00:37:43,127 --> 00:37:46,396
You bet it was.
Hi there.

750
00:37:46,398 --> 00:37:49,131
Michael foster,
Lester's lawyer.

751
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:52,402
Lester's been arrested
For killing his parole officer.

752
00:37:52,404 --> 00:37:55,305
He shot and killed
About 20 people.

753
00:37:55,307 --> 00:37:57,873
That's awful.
You're tellin' me.

754
00:37:57,875 --> 00:38:00,276
So what's gonna
Happen to him now?

755
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,512
He'll get about
Five or six days in jail.

756
00:38:02,514 --> 00:38:04,514
He'll be out on parole
Soon enough. I am
His lawyer after all.

757
00:38:04,516 --> 00:38:06,783
Really?
No.

758
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:08,618
I'd say the electric chair's
About the best he can
Hope for now.

759
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,453
<i>que horrible.</i>

760
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:13,255
You're probably wondering
Who is going to
Take over the studio

761
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:15,658
In lester's absence.
It's his wishes

762
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:20,129
That i introduce to you
His associate, nancy longbottom.

763
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:25,234
Let's hope she's hot.
No more fives and sixes
In the office.

764
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:28,571
Hey, nancy.
Thank you, michael.

765
00:38:28,573 --> 00:38:31,106
Isn't nancy
A girl's name?

766
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:33,209
Amanda: wes! So lame.

767
00:38:33,211 --> 00:38:36,412
No, that's fine. I've
Heard it since i was a kid.
Got used to it now.

768
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:40,783
I have to get going,
And i'm gonna leave you
In the capable hands of nancy.

769
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:42,785
Thanks, michael.

770
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:44,954
Let me just be the first
To say we're really
Glad to have you here.

771
00:38:44,956 --> 00:38:46,789
You have some
Pretty big shoes to fill.

772
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:51,594
Shut up, fat face. And you.
You ever laugh at my name again,

773
00:38:51,596 --> 00:38:54,897
I'll put my arm
Down your throat,
Grab hold of your balls,

774
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:57,333
Pull 'em out
And kick you
In the nuts.

775
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,402
All right, son?

776
00:38:59,404 --> 00:39:03,873
You might have noticed
I've got a bit of a complex
About my name.

777
00:39:05,542 --> 00:39:07,209
Now...

778
00:39:09,112 --> 00:39:12,081
Now that we all know
Who's got the biggest
Set of bollocks around here,

779
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:13,783
Let's get
Down to business.

780
00:39:13,785 --> 00:39:17,052
I'm here to make sure
You hit your deadlines.

781
00:39:17,054 --> 00:39:19,188
You have a couple of days.

782
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,791
So far, you're filling
Those shoes nicely.

783
00:39:21,793 --> 00:39:24,226
Shut it.
So i'm here

784
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:27,497
To give you some inspiration.
In fact,

785
00:39:27,499 --> 00:39:29,499
I'm gonna tell you
A story.

786
00:39:29,501 --> 00:39:32,502
Once upon a time,
In the east end of london,

787
00:39:32,504 --> 00:39:35,571
There was a little lad.
He used to go to the movies

788
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:39,375
Every sunday with his auntie.
His name was nancy.

789
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:43,212
<i>nancy's favorite movie
Was a movie called snatch,</i>

790
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:46,849
Because it had this big,
Fierce guy in there.

791
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:49,318
His name was
Bullet-tooth tony.

792
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,388
Now bullet-tooth tony...
(unsnaps locks)

793
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:57,226
Had a gun, and it was
A desert eagle .50.

794
00:39:57,228 --> 00:40:02,231
A bit similar to this one.
(all exclaiming)

795
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:07,503
Now... If you lot
Don't write this script,

796
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:10,606
I'm gonna end up shootin'
At least six of ya.

797
00:40:12,008 --> 00:40:13,676
So let's get it done,
Shall we?

798
00:40:16,179 --> 00:40:19,482
<i>now!!
No me mate, por favor.</i>

799
00:40:25,288 --> 00:40:29,191
I'm just reading
The u.S. Mandated set of rules

800
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:31,861
For all businesses.

801
00:40:31,863 --> 00:40:36,298
I don't know exactly
If it specifically says

802
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,868
It's illegal to bring
A gun to work

803
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:41,704
And threaten your employees,

804
00:40:41,706 --> 00:40:45,975
But i'm pretty positive
It says it here somewhere.

805
00:40:47,444 --> 00:40:49,846
I know you can't
Bring two guns,

806
00:40:49,848 --> 00:40:52,582
Or have two people
Bring a gun at the same time.

807
00:41:08,298 --> 00:41:10,332
(imitating nancy's accent)
'ello there.

808
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:12,568
I'm bullet-tooth... Ah!

809
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:15,304
(screaming)

810
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:21,110
Yep. Right here. Right here.
No, that's not it.

811
00:41:21,112 --> 00:41:22,778
I think
It's a great idea.

812
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,413
Really? You're not
Just saying that?

813
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:25,715
No. I think
He'll love your script.

814
00:41:25,717 --> 00:41:28,117
I think people will
Really connect with it.

815
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:30,386
I've never read it.

816
00:41:30,388 --> 00:41:32,722
Here's what happened.

817
00:41:32,724 --> 00:41:34,524
The script is really long,

818
00:41:34,526 --> 00:41:37,493
So i took a week
Off of work to read it.

819
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,795
I was at my apartment
Out on the balcony,

820
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:43,733
It was really windy,
And the pages started
Blowin' everywhere.

821
00:41:43,735 --> 00:41:46,569
All over the place.
And when i say everywhere,

822
00:41:46,571 --> 00:41:49,304
I mean everywhere.
They were all over
My neighborhood.

823
00:41:49,306 --> 00:41:52,474
It's over 600 pages.

824
00:41:52,476 --> 00:41:55,645
And here's the thing.
He didn't number them.

825
00:41:55,647 --> 00:41:59,248
You have to number
Your pages always.

826
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:02,618
So i didn't
Get to read it.

827
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:05,254
Let me ask you
A question about
My script that you read.

828
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:08,257
The father scene
Where my father was
Abusive to the character,

829
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:10,492
Do you think the color
I picked for the tricycle

830
00:42:10,494 --> 00:42:12,528
Matches the emotional
Tone of the scene?

831
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,930
Um, i...
What color was it?

832
00:42:13,932 --> 00:42:16,432
What was it?

833
00:42:16,434 --> 00:42:19,268
I can't quite remember.
I'm forgetting.

834
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:21,136
Green?
No, green was my big wheel.

835
00:42:21,138 --> 00:42:23,172
Red?
No, it wouldn't be red.

836
00:42:23,174 --> 00:42:25,541
So aren't you
A little worried about
The length of your script?

837
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,543
No. Why, do you think
It's too short?

838
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,679
He said it should be,
Like, 90 pages.

839
00:42:29,681 --> 00:42:32,314
So you should probably
Hurry up if you want
To finish it, right?

840
00:42:32,316 --> 00:42:35,785
Yeah, i better get goin'.
I've only got four hours left.

841
00:42:35,787 --> 00:42:37,553
It's not due till
Tomorrow morning.

842
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,455
But my bedtime's 10:00.
Where are you going?

843
00:42:39,457 --> 00:42:41,691
Randy, i drove you today.

844
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:44,927
No running in the halls.

845
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:46,428
Hi, randy.

846
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:48,430
Oh, hey, gotta go.
Lot of work to do.

847
00:42:48,432 --> 00:42:50,967
Okay? Love you though.
(crashing)

848
00:42:50,969 --> 00:42:54,403
I'm sorry. I actually
Didn't mean that
Last part, okay?

849
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,438
Have a good day.
You didn't?

850
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,474
Huh? No. Gotta go!

851
00:43:39,215 --> 00:43:41,216
Oh, no.

852
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:43,552
Oh, god.
Oh, god.

853
00:43:45,155 --> 00:43:47,289
Oh, no!

854
00:43:50,627 --> 00:43:52,828
Hi, randy.
Oh, hey. How are ya?

855
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:57,466
Good, and you?
Fine. Totally fine.

856
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:59,301
Well, back to work.

857
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:05,541
Oh, no.

858
00:44:13,717 --> 00:44:15,885
What happened?

859
00:44:22,125 --> 00:44:24,359
Fifteen. Eight.

860
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:27,362
Ninety-seven.
Eight. Okay.

861
00:44:27,364 --> 00:44:31,701
And... 90.
Done.

862
00:44:35,638 --> 00:44:38,507
So i'm stealing that little
Prick's tricycle script.

863
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:41,744
I can't lose my job.
How am i gonna do it?

864
00:44:41,746 --> 00:44:43,545
Easy. Rule #1:

865
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:48,550
What?

866
00:45:02,899 --> 00:45:04,834
Shit!

867
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:16,946
Something about smoke alarms.
I don't know. I always forget.

868
00:45:16,948 --> 00:45:18,948
(loud beeping)

869
00:45:22,652 --> 00:45:25,855
Rule #5: always have
A paper clip and chewing gum.

870
00:45:25,857 --> 00:45:28,590
Wait, i don't think that's...

871
00:45:30,193 --> 00:45:32,027
(quiet vibrating)

872
00:45:32,029 --> 00:45:36,632
Today is the day
I get to pitch my script.

873
00:45:36,634 --> 00:45:40,369
This could be the beginning
Of my new life.

874
00:45:41,704 --> 00:45:43,773
Apparently, i peed
My pants last night,

875
00:45:43,775 --> 00:45:46,375
And i think there might have
Been a fire in my apartment.

876
00:45:46,377 --> 00:45:48,710
(loud slurping)

877
00:45:51,181 --> 00:45:53,548
Well, guys...

878
00:45:54,717 --> 00:45:57,519
You must admit,
All your ideas are crap.

879
00:45:57,521 --> 00:46:01,924
So, matt and brian
Apparently have a script

880
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:06,695
With a big name attached,
So, matt, brian.

881
00:46:09,065 --> 00:46:12,001
I can't work there anymore.
That is not a studio, okay?

882
00:46:12,003 --> 00:46:15,070
It's a joke. I've never
Heard of one of their movies.

883
00:46:15,072 --> 00:46:17,239
Tom hanks.
We had tom hanks.

884
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:18,740
Tom hanks on
A letter
Of intent.

885
00:46:18,742 --> 00:46:21,476
Go away. Get out.
Come on, man, let's go.

886
00:46:21,478 --> 00:46:23,745
(tires screeching)

887
00:46:23,747 --> 00:46:26,615
Fantastic, randy.
Thanks for joining us.

888
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:30,419
I don't suppose
There's any chance of you
Comin' out with a screenplay

889
00:46:30,421 --> 00:46:31,887
Or anything?

890
00:46:31,889 --> 00:46:34,456
I think you're all
Gonna really like it.

891
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:36,558
Love it, really.

892
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,761
I've been working on it
My whole life.

893
00:46:39,763 --> 00:46:42,364
It couldn't be crappier
Than wes' idea about a tricycle.

894
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:44,399
(all laughing)

895
00:46:44,401 --> 00:46:46,568
Yeah, it was stupid.
What?

896
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:48,704
Am i not
Speakin' english?

897
00:46:48,706 --> 00:46:52,174
Wes here wanted
To do a movie
About...

898
00:46:52,176 --> 00:46:55,577
Some abused kid
On a tricycle.
Same old tired crap.

899
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:59,849
Abuse happens every day.
Just suck it up. Whatever.

900
00:47:03,586 --> 00:47:07,857
I can't believe it.
I was going to pitch
A very similar idea

901
00:47:07,859 --> 00:47:10,226
About a tricycle
And an abused kid.

902
00:47:10,228 --> 00:47:15,464
So what's your idea?
My idea. You probably
Want my idea.

903
00:47:15,466 --> 00:47:18,033
Oh, jesus christ.

904
00:47:18,035 --> 00:47:20,502
Jesus christ.

905
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:23,739
I would like to thank you all
For joining me

906
00:47:23,741 --> 00:47:26,075
For my last supper.

907
00:47:26,077 --> 00:47:29,211
Now, first things first.

908
00:47:29,213 --> 00:47:34,549
Must we all be on
The same side of the table?

909
00:47:34,551 --> 00:47:37,086
I don't understand.
There's no chairs.

910
00:47:37,088 --> 00:47:39,021
(all murmuring)

911
00:47:39,023 --> 00:47:41,924
Perhaps a few of you
Could move to the other
Side of the table.

912
00:47:41,926 --> 00:47:45,394
That way, we could
See each other.

913
00:47:45,396 --> 00:47:47,763
Forget it.

914
00:47:47,765 --> 00:47:50,866
I'm afraid i have
Some troubling news.

915
00:47:52,468 --> 00:47:57,706
One of you
At this very table

916
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:59,841
Is going to betray me.

917
00:48:01,244 --> 00:48:04,846
Now, i won't say who.

918
00:48:04,848 --> 00:48:08,951
I don't think
That's the right thing to do.

919
00:48:10,253 --> 00:48:14,089
(forced choking voice)
Judas!

920
00:48:14,091 --> 00:48:19,929
But i will... I will say that
It's none of you six men.

921
00:48:22,933 --> 00:48:25,034
Nor is it you.

922
00:48:26,836 --> 00:48:28,770
Or you.

923
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:35,177
No. Or you.

924
00:48:38,348 --> 00:48:41,450
It is not you.

925
00:48:41,452 --> 00:48:43,685
Or judas.

926
00:48:45,188 --> 00:48:47,589
Ben!
Randy?

927
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:50,292
(whistling)
Hey, ben, wake up.

928
00:48:50,294 --> 00:48:53,095
Ben, this is
Your big chance.

929
00:48:53,097 --> 00:48:54,964
Ben.
Randy.

930
00:48:54,966 --> 00:48:56,031
Ben. Hey, ben!

931
00:48:56,033 --> 00:48:58,600
(slow-motion
Distorted voices)

932
00:49:00,303 --> 00:49:02,904
(distorted)
What's your bloody idea?

933
00:49:02,906 --> 00:49:05,841
This is
Your big chance.

934
00:49:05,843 --> 00:49:08,577
Spoof movie.
Spoof movie?

935
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:11,046
Oh, no. I hate
Spoof movies.

936
00:49:11,048 --> 00:49:13,915
'cause that's brilliant.
I said it, i did.
I love them.

937
00:49:13,917 --> 00:49:16,318
It's a good idea.
Can you expand on it
For us?

938
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,454
There's no plot.
Script?

939
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:21,423
No script.
Good.

940
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:27,296
A spoof improv movie.
Yeah, that's what
I was goin' for.

941
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:29,398
Improv spoof movie.
Yeah.

942
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,932
Title?

943
00:49:30,934 --> 00:49:36,671
Not another, um...
Not another... Movie.

944
00:49:36,673 --> 00:49:40,209
I like it.
What do you think, guys?

945
00:49:40,211 --> 00:49:42,811
Do we agree?
I like it?

946
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:44,679
We're gonna have
So much fun on this.

947
00:49:44,681 --> 00:49:47,082
We all agree?
We're all focused
On the same direction.

948
00:49:47,084 --> 00:49:49,351
Now i don't
Have to kill ya.

949
00:49:49,353 --> 00:49:52,454
(uproarious laughter)

950
00:49:52,456 --> 00:49:55,690
Long day.
(laughter continues)

951
00:49:57,027 --> 00:50:00,662
I'm frustrated.
Spoof movies!

952
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:02,764
(groans)

953
00:50:02,766 --> 00:50:06,001
All the time, every minute,
I fall asleep, you know,

954
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:07,469
And i dream
Of these spoof movies,

955
00:50:07,471 --> 00:50:09,038
And i hate it.
I wanna be...

956
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,205
(pounding)

957
00:50:10,207 --> 00:50:13,008
Sorry. When i think of
A spoof movie,

958
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:16,345
I just... (pounds)...
I kinda get upset.

959
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:20,382
<i>but i wanna dream of art movies,
You know, like the piano.</i>

960
00:50:20,384 --> 00:50:22,884
<i>or pi.
Those are art.</i>

961
00:50:22,886 --> 00:50:26,255
Not spoofs.
Not at all.

962
00:50:26,257 --> 00:50:28,723
Randy.
What?

963
00:50:45,908 --> 00:50:51,380
Okay, go and write it, dude.
Write your spoof movie, man.

964
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:53,048
Yeah, sure.

965
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:57,352
Congratulations.
Let's do a spoof movie.

966
00:50:59,021 --> 00:51:01,523
I got a lot of
Brainstorming to do
On the spoof movies.

967
00:51:01,525 --> 00:51:03,292
I love spoof movies.

968
00:51:07,363 --> 00:51:09,598
Do i think they'll do it?

969
00:51:11,033 --> 00:51:13,668
It's possible.
Do i think i could

970
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:16,205
Kill one of them
And get away with it?

971
00:51:16,207 --> 00:51:17,973
It's possible.

972
00:51:20,843 --> 00:51:24,279
It's possible.

973
00:51:24,281 --> 00:51:27,849
So stupid! So stupid!

974
00:51:31,988 --> 00:51:35,690
Spoof movie!
(yelling)

975
00:51:35,692 --> 00:51:38,026
(continues yelling)

976
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:55,010
(cat meows)

977
00:51:56,646 --> 00:52:00,048
Oh, sorry, kitty.
Daddy's...

978
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:02,651
Wait a second.
I don't have a cat.

979
00:52:04,754 --> 00:52:07,222
This isn't my apartment.
Woman: hello?

980
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:15,830
So...

981
00:52:15,832 --> 00:52:18,200
Why are you so sad?

982
00:52:18,202 --> 00:52:20,569
Wendy, i did
Something horrible.

983
00:52:20,571 --> 00:52:24,039
I did something i said
I would never do my whole life

984
00:52:24,041 --> 00:52:28,644
I sold my soul.
I'm making a spoof movie.

985
00:52:28,646 --> 00:52:32,814
You can never talk to me
Again if you don't want to.

986
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:34,849
First of all,
I like spoof movies.

987
00:52:34,851 --> 00:52:38,053
No, you don't.
You're always talking
In our poetry club

988
00:52:38,055 --> 00:52:40,722
How you hate 'em
And they're stupid...

989
00:52:40,724 --> 00:52:42,924
No, i don't.
Everybody else does that.

990
00:52:42,926 --> 00:52:46,127
And besides, who cares
What everybody else thinks?

991
00:52:46,129 --> 00:52:51,200
This is your big chance
To make a movie.
You should be happy.

992
00:52:51,202 --> 00:52:54,503
You, right now, are like
A proverb to my soul.

993
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:56,338
I'm gonna do it.

994
00:52:56,340 --> 00:53:00,008
I'm gonna make that
Piece of crap spoof movie,

995
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:03,978
And it's gonna be
The best piece of crap
That anybody has ever made.

996
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:06,682
Can you make me
One pinky promise?

997
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:08,217
You've got
Both of 'em.

998
00:53:08,219 --> 00:53:11,119
Can you just not make
A drama about a tricycle?

999
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:14,423
Oh, yeah.
No, no, no.

1000
00:53:14,425 --> 00:53:15,691
(stammering)

1001
00:53:15,693 --> 00:53:17,792
I'm kidding, randy.

1002
00:53:17,794 --> 00:53:20,629
I read your script,
Remember, about your abuse.

1003
00:53:20,631 --> 00:53:23,998
Yeah. That actually
Wasn't about me, remember?

1004
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,703
That was about my cousin.
The character, my cousin.

1005
00:53:27,705 --> 00:53:29,037
Then why did you
Call him randy

1006
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:31,240
And have the same
Parents' names as yours?

1007
00:53:31,242 --> 00:53:34,243
And how he also
Had a brother named joshua?

1008
00:53:34,245 --> 00:53:37,846
You're right. Making
A spoof movie's
A great opportunity.

1009
00:53:42,985 --> 00:53:45,854
So it's the big day. Oh!

1010
00:53:45,856 --> 00:53:47,723
It's the start of
Pre-production,

1011
00:53:47,725 --> 00:53:50,125
And i have got
A lot of pressure on me.

1012
00:53:50,127 --> 00:53:52,594
You know,
Because i'm in charge.

1013
00:53:52,596 --> 00:53:54,396
But it's okay,

1014
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:56,665
Because everyone says
I work best under pressure.

1015
00:53:56,667 --> 00:53:59,167
(all clamoring)

1016
00:54:05,375 --> 00:54:08,777
Speak english!
Speak english!

1017
00:54:08,779 --> 00:54:11,913
(all yelling)

1018
00:54:22,358 --> 00:54:24,192
Where's randy?

1019
00:54:24,194 --> 00:54:27,028
I think he quit,
So i'll just take over.

1020
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:29,164
Sorry i'm late.

1021
00:54:29,166 --> 00:54:31,433
Hey, where you been?
You'll never believe
What happened, guys.

1022
00:54:31,435 --> 00:54:33,602
I woke up and all
My wheels were flat.

1023
00:54:33,604 --> 00:54:35,637
Apparently i ran over
A bunch of knives last night.

1024
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:38,440
Everybody's wondering
What their job's gonna be
On the shoot.

1025
00:54:38,442 --> 00:54:40,175
Yeah.

1026
00:54:40,177 --> 00:54:42,444
Okay. Yeah, great.
I can tell you this.

1027
00:54:42,446 --> 00:54:45,414
Wes and steve, you're gonna
Be production assistants.

1028
00:54:45,416 --> 00:54:47,783
Just ask ernie.
It's a great job.

1029
00:54:47,785 --> 00:54:52,020
No! Are you kidding me?

1030
00:54:52,022 --> 00:54:54,255
Production assistant.

1031
00:54:54,257 --> 00:54:56,991
I am the head writer
Of this studio.

1032
00:54:56,993 --> 00:54:59,127
You know what? Fine.

1033
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:01,496
If randy wants to have
A little war,

1034
00:55:01,498 --> 00:55:04,599
That's what randy's gonna get.
He's gonna get a war.

1035
00:55:04,601 --> 00:55:08,770
Okay, bart, you're gonna
Be doing casting.

1036
00:55:08,772 --> 00:55:13,442
Oh, ernie, i was
Thinking you could be
The executive producer.

1037
00:55:13,444 --> 00:55:17,879
Don't you think lester
Might murder ernie
If he finds out

1038
00:55:17,881 --> 00:55:19,948
He's executive producer?

1039
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:21,383
I don't wanna be
Executive producer.

1040
00:55:21,385 --> 00:55:24,285
Ernie, you can do it.
Trust me, man. Trust me.

1041
00:55:24,287 --> 00:55:26,488
Randy, i don't want it!
Calm down.

1042
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:29,123
You can be
The boom operator.

1043
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:30,759
Let's see.
Is that everybody?

1044
00:55:30,761 --> 00:55:32,494
What about me?

1045
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:36,331
Oh, well, i just assumed
You would've known
You were makeup.

1046
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:39,568
Okay here.
I think that's good.

1047
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:41,770
Because i'm a woman.

1048
00:55:41,772 --> 00:55:43,605
I don't even wear makeup.

1049
00:55:43,607 --> 00:55:46,441
I don't know
Anything about it.

1050
00:55:46,443 --> 00:55:50,211
I have six brothers.
I learned to pee standing up.

1051
00:55:50,213 --> 00:55:55,049
Okay, was that everybody?
I know i gave you a job.

1052
00:55:55,051 --> 00:55:57,652
<i>randy, y nosotros?</i>

1053
00:55:57,654 --> 00:56:00,088
(speaks spanish)

1054
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:03,024
I thought the new boss
Was supposed to fire
Alejandro and guzman.

1055
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:04,793
I thought he did.

1056
00:56:04,795 --> 00:56:06,127
I thought you told me
You were gonna
Say something.

1057
00:56:06,129 --> 00:56:08,263
I told 'em
They were fired.

1058
00:56:08,265 --> 00:56:10,899
But when i was in the meeting,
I came in, i didn't
Expect to see them.

1059
00:56:10,901 --> 00:56:12,534
It was so awkward.

1060
00:56:12,536 --> 00:56:14,770
I told 'em.
I don't think
They understand.

1061
00:56:14,772 --> 00:56:17,639
It's probably 'cause
They don't speak english.

1062
00:56:17,641 --> 00:56:20,108
Maybe you should try
To say something again.

1063
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:22,878
You're probably right.
I feel so bad.

1064
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:25,814
I know. They're
Such great guys.

1065
00:56:25,816 --> 00:56:28,884
Just don't tell 'em
I said anything, okay?

1066
00:56:28,886 --> 00:56:30,485
Okay.

1067
00:56:30,487 --> 00:56:33,688
(exhales)
All right, guys.

1068
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:36,057
Bad news again.

1069
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:38,727
You're fired.

1070
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:40,595
<i>gracias.</i>

1071
00:56:40,597 --> 00:56:43,064
<i>gracias.</i>

1072
00:56:43,933 --> 00:56:46,034
<i>adios.</i>

1073
00:56:46,036 --> 00:56:49,370
I heard a voice in the...

1074
00:56:49,372 --> 00:56:51,973
I'm sorry.
It's the...

1075
00:56:51,975 --> 00:56:54,776
You know, square...

1076
00:56:54,778 --> 00:56:56,611
Cold thing.

1077
00:56:56,613 --> 00:57:00,181
Bottom line, boom.
I was born to do casting.

1078
00:57:00,183 --> 00:57:02,250
Okay? My brain farts
Are box office gold.

1079
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:04,319
See, here's what it says.
"refrig..."

1080
00:57:04,321 --> 00:57:06,020
Just say it so i know
You can say the word.

1081
00:57:06,022 --> 00:57:09,558
Refrigerator.
That's really good.
Now just use it!

1082
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:13,227
Acting is reacting. You're doing
None of these things.

1083
00:57:14,564 --> 00:57:17,999
Ernie! Thanks for
Bringing your sister in.

1084
00:57:18,001 --> 00:57:20,068
Hey, i'm an actor,
So i get it.

1085
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:21,603
I get it.
I get what it takes.

1086
00:57:21,605 --> 00:57:23,204
Do you...

1087
00:57:23,206 --> 00:57:25,607
(stammering)

1088
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:28,109
Thank you for coming.
Thank you for coming to
Our facility. Thank you.

1089
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:31,613
Never... Ever...

1090
00:57:31,615 --> 00:57:35,216
Feed them...
Before midnight.

1091
00:57:35,218 --> 00:57:36,685
I mean, after.

1092
00:57:36,687 --> 00:57:40,121
No! Everything you're
Doing is poop.

1093
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:43,091
<i>run, forrest.
I corre!</i>

1094
00:57:43,093 --> 00:57:44,459
No!

1095
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:48,497
<i>forrest, corre!
Corre, forrest.</i>

1096
00:57:49,765 --> 00:57:52,767
<i>corre! Corre!
No, no.</i>

1097
00:57:54,136 --> 00:57:55,570
(shrieking)

1098
00:57:55,572 --> 00:57:59,340
I'm in a play right now
On broadway.

1099
00:57:59,342 --> 00:58:01,476
Not the new york broadway.

1100
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:03,512
Broadway street
Over in glendale.

1101
00:58:03,514 --> 00:58:06,381
There's a theater, nice stage,
Plenty of parking, 99-seat.

1102
00:58:06,383 --> 00:58:08,383
Got ourselves
A nice little run.

1103
00:58:08,385 --> 00:58:10,451
There's even a concession
Stand in the back.

1104
00:58:10,453 --> 00:58:14,723
Boom! Friend request.
Denied.

1105
00:58:21,931 --> 00:58:24,533
Don't cross the streams.

1106
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:28,436
Thank you.

1107
00:58:39,582 --> 00:58:41,816
What? What?
Say it. What?

1108
00:58:41,818 --> 00:58:44,285
Took me a long time
To hang those up.

1109
00:58:47,322 --> 00:58:48,990
Ernie, just leave it.

1110
00:58:48,992 --> 00:58:52,160
Sorry, i...
Just leave it.

1111
00:58:53,162 --> 00:58:54,629
That's my sister.

1112
00:58:54,631 --> 00:58:57,832
The bottom line is,
I get it.

1113
00:58:57,834 --> 00:59:01,903
Okay, uh... Ooh,
Funniest comedian
Of all time.

1114
00:59:01,905 --> 00:59:05,373
Steve... Steven seagal.
What about nipsey russell?

1115
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:07,976
<i>no, ernie. It's
The little kid
From jerry maguire.</i>

1116
00:59:07,978 --> 00:59:09,711
(knocking on door)

1117
00:59:17,019 --> 00:59:20,722
Wait a minute.
This used to be
The bathroom.

1118
00:59:20,724 --> 00:59:22,991
We're just doing
A little editing here.

1119
00:59:22,993 --> 00:59:25,694
Choppin' it up,
Makin' dreams come true.
What brings you back?

1120
00:59:25,696 --> 00:59:29,864
I'm just checkin' up
On my brother, see how
He's runnin' the show.

1121
00:59:29,866 --> 00:59:32,601
Who's your brother?
Because all visitors
Are supposed to check in

1122
00:59:32,603 --> 00:59:36,705
With lewis in the lobby,
And he's a stickler.

1123
00:59:36,707 --> 00:59:38,740
His name is lester,
Lester storm.

1124
00:59:38,742 --> 00:59:41,009
Don't recall.
He's your boss.

1125
00:59:41,011 --> 00:59:42,744
I thought
I was the boss.
I'm taking over for you.

1126
00:59:42,746 --> 00:59:45,346
Randy, randy, randy,
He owns the studio.

1127
00:59:45,348 --> 00:59:48,216
You are the director,
Which means you are
Not in charge.

1128
00:59:48,218 --> 00:59:50,351
Hold it, hold it.

1129
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:51,486
You're the director?

1130
00:59:51,488 --> 00:59:53,554
Yes, sir.
You're the p.A.

1131
00:59:53,556 --> 00:59:56,758
I remember you.
You're that p.A.
You're ken or whatever it is.

1132
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,628
It's randy, actually.
I just remember,
Though, you were a p.A.

1133
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:01,696
That was a long
Time ago, sir.

1134
01:00:01,698 --> 01:00:05,399
That was three days ago.
I know. It's been,
Like, 72 hours.

1135
01:00:05,401 --> 01:00:07,636
He's makin'
A spoof movie.

1136
01:00:07,638 --> 01:00:09,938
No, ernie!
It's really, really funny.

1137
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:11,439
Uh-huh.

1138
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:13,775
Spoof movies.
I hate them. Hate them.

1139
01:00:13,777 --> 01:00:16,878
I don't care
What you call 'em.

1140
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:21,182
It's just cheap, cheap parody.
It can even be expensive.

1141
01:00:21,184 --> 01:00:23,618
<i>they tried to do
Gone with the breeze.</i>

1142
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,620
They couldn't even
Get the fires going.

1143
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:27,488
It was like a breeze.
Just a breeze.

1144
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:29,457
Huh? I don't get it.
I don't get it.

1145
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:31,459
I don't get spoof movies.

1146
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:35,830
I don't see any art
In spoofing something
That was art.

1147
01:00:35,832 --> 01:00:38,099
(stammering)

1148
01:00:38,101 --> 01:00:40,101
Well, wait.

1149
01:00:40,103 --> 01:00:43,071
No, don't like 'em.
Don't like spoof movies.

1150
01:00:43,073 --> 01:00:45,206
We're making one?

1151
01:00:45,208 --> 01:00:47,676
You know where
The men's room is?

1152
01:00:47,678 --> 01:00:49,744
It's right
Out that door.

1153
01:00:49,746 --> 01:00:53,614
Coming through.
Coming in. Hey.
Know where the men's room is?

1154
01:00:53,616 --> 01:00:55,817
Best action movie
Of all time.

1155
01:00:55,819 --> 01:00:59,087
<i>over the top.
Wrong. Delta force.
Scariest movie.</i>

1156
01:00:59,089 --> 01:01:01,556
Scariest movie?

1157
01:01:02,692 --> 01:01:06,427
When i turned ten,
I saw something

1158
01:01:06,429 --> 01:01:07,628
That scared the crap
Outta me.

1159
01:01:07,630 --> 01:01:11,700
A bad guy in a movie, um...

1160
01:01:11,702 --> 01:01:14,035
I don't know
How to put into words...

1161
01:01:14,037 --> 01:01:15,870
Terrorizing.

1162
01:01:15,872 --> 01:01:21,309
He kept me up so many nights,
Givin' me nightmares.

1163
01:01:23,779 --> 01:01:25,747
Still does.

1164
01:01:25,749 --> 01:01:30,251
<i>it was the bad guy from
Kindergarten cop.</i>

1165
01:01:32,421 --> 01:01:33,788
Hey, how you doin'?

1166
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:36,124
Hey, how's it goin'?
Good.

1167
01:01:36,126 --> 01:01:38,559
<i>kindergarten cop.
Hey, how are you?</i>

1168
01:01:38,561 --> 01:01:40,561
Awesome to meet
You, man.
Richard tyson.

1169
01:01:40,563 --> 01:01:42,563
Richard, bart.
Wow. I'm bart.

1170
01:01:42,565 --> 01:01:45,767
Yeah, just put that
On file there. Wow!

1171
01:01:45,769 --> 01:01:48,569
Yeah. On file here.
That's awesome.
Nice to meet you.

1172
01:01:48,571 --> 01:01:50,671
What's your name?
I'm bart.

1173
01:01:50,673 --> 01:01:52,573
Bart, nice to
Meet you, man.

1174
01:01:52,575 --> 01:01:54,442
This is my best head shot
I've ever had.

1175
01:01:54,444 --> 01:01:57,411
We'll keep it on file here.
This is randy.

1176
01:01:57,413 --> 01:01:59,480
Hey, randy, how you--

1177
01:01:59,482 --> 01:02:01,750
Randy?
Randy?

1178
01:02:06,188 --> 01:02:08,189
Is it something i ate?
That is randy.

1179
01:02:08,191 --> 01:02:09,824
He's energetic, isn't he?

1180
01:02:09,826 --> 01:02:12,627
I'm wiping my eyes.
Am i sitting here
With richard tyson?

1181
01:02:12,629 --> 01:02:14,729
Are you? Wow.
Wow!

1182
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:16,765
I'm very honored to be here.

1183
01:02:16,767 --> 01:02:19,167
I mean, yeah.
You might be
Perfect for this.

1184
01:02:19,169 --> 01:02:20,902
Might be?

1185
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:22,971
<i>remember when you
Worked with schwarzenegger
On kindergarten cop?</i>

1186
01:02:22,973 --> 01:02:24,538
Oh, schwarzenegger.
Yeah, yeah.

1187
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:26,507
You guys had
That on-screen chemistry.

1188
01:02:26,509 --> 01:02:28,509
I looked at you,
And you get it
Like i get it.

1189
01:02:28,511 --> 01:02:29,844
On-screen what?

1190
01:02:31,413 --> 01:02:35,549
You know, i'm starting to
Get used to this makeup thing.

1191
01:02:35,551 --> 01:02:38,653
I mean, it's a gift.
I never knew i had it,

1192
01:02:38,655 --> 01:02:41,656
But i'm pretty good at it.

1193
01:02:41,658 --> 01:02:46,161
Kind of regret not wearing it
More as a child.

1194
01:02:46,163 --> 01:02:47,862
Maybe i should try it.

1195
01:02:47,864 --> 01:02:50,464
(quiet conversation
And laughter)

1196
01:02:50,466 --> 01:02:53,401
What up, what up?
Tryin' to make an honest dollar.

1197
01:02:53,403 --> 01:02:55,403
Know what i'm sayin',
Guys, boss man?

1198
01:02:55,405 --> 01:02:57,205
One more word, i'll
Rip your lips off

1199
01:02:57,207 --> 01:02:59,440
And glue 'em to your navel.
Morning, randy.

1200
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:02,010
Good morning.
What a happy day, huh?

1201
01:03:02,012 --> 01:03:03,912
Amanda.
Yes, sir?

1202
01:03:03,914 --> 01:03:06,547
You look
Like a hooker.
Thank you, sir.

1203
01:03:06,549 --> 01:03:08,850
<i>that's very sweet.
Buenos dias.</i>

1204
01:03:08,852 --> 01:03:10,584
<i>hola.</i>

1205
01:03:10,586 --> 01:03:12,620
What are they
Still doing here?

1206
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:15,423
Let's get down to it.
Let's go over these schedules.

1207
01:03:16,625 --> 01:03:18,993
We have one week left. Randy,

1208
01:03:18,995 --> 01:03:20,695
You have the details.

1209
01:03:20,697 --> 01:03:22,831
I apologize. I'll go over
The details here.

1210
01:03:22,833 --> 01:03:25,867
Sir, what we have
Here with the... Ow!

1211
01:03:25,869 --> 01:03:28,303
Nancy: what's your problem?

1212
01:03:28,305 --> 01:03:30,238
I think something
Bit me, sir. Ow! Mm!

1213
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:31,806
Wes: what's wrong, randy?

1214
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:35,009
Oh, oh!
You okay?

1215
01:03:35,011 --> 01:03:38,079
I feel like something
Is biting my nards.

1216
01:03:38,081 --> 01:03:40,681
You're screwin' with
My hangover right now.

1217
01:03:40,683 --> 01:03:42,917
I'm so sorry. No!

1218
01:03:42,919 --> 01:03:45,386
You want me to fire you?
You'll be off this project.

1219
01:03:45,388 --> 01:03:49,657
Feels like something is
Literally taking a bite
Of my genitals.

1220
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:52,093
One more word, and i'll
Staple your lips together.

1221
01:03:52,095 --> 01:03:55,496
'cause i have a nail gun...
(gun fires again)

1222
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:57,631
Right here.

1223
01:03:57,633 --> 01:04:00,468
Now keep it shut.
(gun fires again)

1224
01:04:00,470 --> 01:04:02,603
Right. Saving caps.
What are we gonna do?

1225
01:04:02,605 --> 01:04:06,774
You know what, sir?
I actually don't have
Any ideas on this matter,

1226
01:04:06,776 --> 01:04:09,410
But randy has quite a few.
Go ahead, randy.

1227
01:04:09,412 --> 01:04:11,012
(gun fires again)
Randy?

1228
01:04:11,014 --> 01:04:13,848
You understand the queen's
English, randy? Spit it out.

1229
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:15,716
Just tell him
Your ideas.
(gun fires repeatedly)

1230
01:04:15,718 --> 01:04:19,020
Come on, randy.
Just let it out.
Go ahead.

1231
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:22,957
Get off my shoes, randy.

1232
01:04:22,959 --> 01:04:27,128
That's what we don't
Need in a leader, right?
Am i right?

1233
01:04:27,130 --> 01:04:29,597
It was kind of like
Being pinched really hard

1234
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:31,599
In the nut sack.

1235
01:04:31,601 --> 01:04:33,868
My dad used to pinch me
Really hard

1236
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:36,170
When i wouldn't salute him
Or call him sir,

1237
01:04:36,172 --> 01:04:39,040
Or get the towels
In the bathroom
Aligned just perfectly.

1238
01:04:39,042 --> 01:04:41,542
They had to be perfect,
The his and her towels.

1239
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:44,712
I mean, aligned just right,
Or, oof!

1240
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:47,982
He also used to shoot me
With a bb gun, and that hurt.

1241
01:04:47,984 --> 01:04:49,984
<i>wait a second.</i>

1242
01:04:49,986 --> 01:04:51,852
If you mess with me,

1243
01:04:51,854 --> 01:04:54,655
I will cut your throat
Like a stick of butter.

1244
01:04:54,657 --> 01:04:57,091
Like a stick
Of butter. Like.

1245
01:04:57,093 --> 01:04:58,927
No. I mean...

1246
01:04:58,929 --> 01:05:00,929
If you mess with me,
I will cut your throat...

1247
01:05:00,931 --> 01:05:02,997
You're not scary.
"if you mess with me,

1248
01:05:02,999 --> 01:05:06,334
I'll cut your throat
Like a stick of butter,"
Is the line.

1249
01:05:06,336 --> 01:05:10,738
If you mess with me,
I will cut your throat
Like a stick of butter.

1250
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:12,807
Okay?
It was bad.

1251
01:05:12,809 --> 01:05:15,076
I'll tell you,
You're too cute...

1252
01:05:15,078 --> 01:05:18,079
If you mess with me,
I will cut your throat
Like a stick of butter.

1253
01:05:18,081 --> 01:05:20,415
That's the best you got?
Ow!! What?

1254
01:05:20,417 --> 01:05:23,084
(forcefully)
If you mess with me,

1255
01:05:23,086 --> 01:05:26,587
I will cut your throat
Like a stick of butter.

1256
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:29,523
I knew it!
Get out of my way!

1257
01:05:30,625 --> 01:05:32,760
What's wrong with that guy?

1258
01:05:34,330 --> 01:05:37,065
I don't know.
What's this guy's problem?

1259
01:05:37,067 --> 01:05:39,968
I'm gonna fuckin'
Knock him across the wall

1260
01:05:39,970 --> 01:05:42,103
In a second here.
I don't...

1261
01:05:42,105 --> 01:05:45,440
What's he afraid of, ya know?
I celebrate christmas,

1262
01:05:45,442 --> 01:05:50,445
I go to the ymca
On occasion.

1263
01:05:50,447 --> 01:05:52,646
I walk to the park.

1264
01:05:52,648 --> 01:05:55,583
Sometimes, i sail on boats.

1265
01:05:55,585 --> 01:05:59,187
Randy? Hey, i'm sorry, dude.

1266
01:05:59,189 --> 01:06:02,490
Come on. We got off
On the wrong foot.

1267
01:06:02,492 --> 01:06:07,228
I feel bad. I was just
Readin' my lines, right?
You wrote the lines.

1268
01:06:07,230 --> 01:06:09,397
If you come out here,
We give it a chance,

1269
01:06:09,399 --> 01:06:11,732
We'll start over.
How's that sound?

1270
01:06:13,302 --> 01:06:15,036
All right.

1271
01:06:15,038 --> 01:06:18,539
You're startin' to make me
Look like an asshole.

1272
01:06:18,541 --> 01:06:21,876
If you don't come up,
I'm gonna go out to my truck,

1273
01:06:21,878 --> 01:06:24,912
Get my filet knife,
And gut you like a fish.

1274
01:06:27,983 --> 01:06:31,585
Startin' to make me
Look like an asshole.

1275
01:06:31,587 --> 01:06:33,754
'cause acting,
That's like a tennis match.

1276
01:06:33,756 --> 01:06:36,457
It's like, you fire
Me a line and then you fire one.

1277
01:06:36,459 --> 01:06:38,426
And then it's
Back and forth.

1278
01:06:38,428 --> 01:06:40,495
Who wins, i don't know.
That's how the scene plays out,

1279
01:06:40,497 --> 01:06:42,730
<i>but, um... When
A few good men came out,</i>

1280
01:06:42,732 --> 01:06:46,234
Were you gettin',
Like, mad ass?

1281
01:06:46,236 --> 01:06:47,535
I'm married.

1282
01:06:47,537 --> 01:06:49,037
That's cool.

1283
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:51,805
You know what?
I need to talk
To the director,

1284
01:06:51,807 --> 01:06:54,108
If he's awake.

1285
01:06:54,110 --> 01:06:55,910
Randy!

1286
01:07:00,382 --> 01:07:03,484
Okay, patrick,
How's it goin'?
Any word?

1287
01:07:03,486 --> 01:07:05,119
Nothin'.
Okay.

1288
01:07:05,121 --> 01:07:08,923
John. John, how you doin'
On that asteroid, man?

1289
01:07:12,528 --> 01:07:16,864
Listen, we really need you
To push that button or
We're all gonna die here, john.

1290
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:22,470
<i>john! We really need you
To push that button, man.</i>

1291
01:07:22,472 --> 01:07:24,672
<i>come on, john,
Push the button.</i>

1292
01:07:24,674 --> 01:07:27,741
What are you doin', john?

1293
01:07:27,743 --> 01:07:29,677
What are you doin'?

1294
01:07:29,679 --> 01:07:32,213
John, push
The button, buddy.

1295
01:07:32,215 --> 01:07:34,515
Come out to the asteroid,
We'll get together,

1296
01:07:34,517 --> 01:07:36,451
We'll have a few laughs.

1297
01:07:36,453 --> 01:07:39,620
John, you gotta do it, man!
We're runnin' outta time.
Come on, mcclane.

1298
01:07:39,622 --> 01:07:41,589
Welcome to the party, pal.

1299
01:07:41,591 --> 01:07:44,325
John, listen to me
Very carefully.
You gotta push that button.

1300
01:07:44,327 --> 01:07:47,195
What do you think,
I'm stupid, ha--?

1301
01:07:48,930 --> 01:07:52,300
I said, what do you think,
I'm stupid, hans?

1302
01:07:52,302 --> 01:07:55,536
Who the hell is hans?
John, come on, man.
Push the button!

1303
01:07:55,538 --> 01:07:56,937
Let me talk
To my daughter.

1304
01:07:58,607 --> 01:08:00,508
John, listen to me
Very carefully.

1305
01:08:00,510 --> 01:08:03,043
You've already spoken to
Your daughter three times, okay?

1306
01:08:03,045 --> 01:08:07,515
<i>daddy?
Hey, baby.
It's daddy.</i>

1307
01:08:07,517 --> 01:08:12,553
You gotta help us.
We need to live.
You gotta push the button.

1308
01:08:12,555 --> 01:08:15,590
I'm gonna have to break
That promise i made to ya.

1309
01:08:15,592 --> 01:08:17,191
<i>daddy's not
Comin' home.</i>

1310
01:08:17,193 --> 01:08:20,261
I know. You gotta
Push the button, okay?

1311
01:08:20,263 --> 01:08:23,397
What am i doin'
With a gun in space?

1312
01:08:23,399 --> 01:08:26,000
You gotta press the button!
Press the button!

1313
01:08:26,002 --> 01:08:27,502
Push it, john!
Daddy, push it!

1314
01:08:27,504 --> 01:08:28,969
Let me talk to him.
Okay.

1315
01:08:28,971 --> 01:08:31,772
I gotta quit
Smokin' cigarettes.

1316
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:37,011
Dad, it's me. Listen.
What you're doin' is
A very brave thing.

1317
01:08:37,013 --> 01:08:39,413
You should be proud.
I am.

1318
01:08:39,415 --> 01:08:42,750
I'm just the wrong guy
In the wrong place
At the wrong time.

1319
01:08:42,752 --> 01:08:46,287
Wait a minute.
That's not my dad.

1320
01:08:46,289 --> 01:08:50,958
My dad's supposed to be
Flying a fighter jet into
An alien spaceship.

1321
01:08:53,462 --> 01:08:55,496
Who's drivin' this ship,
Stevie wonder?

1322
01:08:55,498 --> 01:08:57,598
Sorry.
It's cool.

1323
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,700
There's some tang
In the cooler.
I'll get some tang.

1324
01:08:59,702 --> 01:09:01,435
They still make tang?
They do.

1325
01:09:01,437 --> 01:09:04,004
I love tang.
You know they make
Grape tang now.

1326
01:09:04,006 --> 01:09:07,041
John! John,
Push the button, john!

1327
01:09:07,043 --> 01:09:08,976
Johnny, push
The button, john!

1328
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:11,111
It's over, john.
We all hate you, john.

1329
01:09:11,113 --> 01:09:12,980
<i>push it!</i>

1330
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:15,183
Yippie-kai-yay, mother...

1331
01:09:16,685 --> 01:09:18,419
Yippie-kai-yay, mother...

1332
01:09:23,458 --> 01:09:27,061
Yippie-kai-yay, moth--

1333
01:09:27,063 --> 01:09:30,731
He pushed the button!
He pushed the button!

1334
01:09:32,334 --> 01:09:35,002
I love him.
He pushed the button.

1335
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:36,837
I love my dad.
Guys, actually,

1336
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:38,539
He didn't push
The button in time.

1337
01:09:38,541 --> 01:09:39,907
What?

1338
01:09:39,909 --> 01:09:41,809
He only missed it
By a few minutes.

1339
01:09:41,811 --> 01:09:43,811
Yeah, exactly.

1340
01:09:43,813 --> 01:09:46,814
Actually, he missed it
By about an hour and a half.

1341
01:09:46,816 --> 01:09:50,718
Oh, look. It just
Touched the earth.

1342
01:09:52,487 --> 01:09:53,421
Are we gonna...

1343
01:09:59,828 --> 01:10:02,763
Randy!
Get up.

1344
01:10:03,832 --> 01:10:05,966
Wastin' the talent's
Time here.

1345
01:10:07,402 --> 01:10:08,969
I'll talk to you, cuba.

1346
01:10:08,971 --> 01:10:11,905
Sorry about that.
I dozed off there.

1347
01:10:11,907 --> 01:10:15,843
Hey, i was hopin'
I'd get a chance
To talk to you, wolfgang.

1348
01:10:15,845 --> 01:10:18,145
Can i call you wolf?
Yeah.

1349
01:10:18,147 --> 01:10:20,514
Great. Listen, dawg,
You had a great performance,

1350
01:10:20,516 --> 01:10:22,683
Especially those
Last few takes.
It was so good.

1351
01:10:22,685 --> 01:10:25,018
It was great.
There's nothin'
I can even say.

1352
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:26,820
It was amazing.
Thank you.

1353
01:10:26,822 --> 01:10:31,925
I do have some notes,
Mainly about your dialogue.
Not working.

1354
01:10:31,927 --> 01:10:33,994
You want me to do
Something different?

1355
01:10:33,996 --> 01:10:36,130
I'm just tryin' to do
The lines like in the movie.

1356
01:10:36,132 --> 01:10:39,300
Yeah, that's what i was
Hoping for, too, along
With the rest of the crew.

1357
01:10:39,302 --> 01:10:42,303
Really, what i was hoping
For was maybe that you
Did some research,

1358
01:10:42,305 --> 01:10:46,674
And maybe rented the movie
Once or twice or once.

1359
01:10:46,676 --> 01:10:51,746
Really researched it,
Because you obviously
Don't know what a code red is.

1360
01:10:51,748 --> 01:10:55,750
I don't need
To rent the movie.
I was in the movie.

1361
01:10:55,752 --> 01:10:57,818
I know what
A code red is.

1362
01:10:57,820 --> 01:11:00,888
Were you an extra?
An extra?

1363
01:11:00,890 --> 01:11:04,158
Mm-hmm.
I was one of the leads.

1364
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:06,494
That's why they
Cast me in this role.

1365
01:11:06,496 --> 01:11:08,729
It was a role
I played in the movie.

1366
01:11:08,731 --> 01:11:11,198
I get it.

1367
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:13,734
This is an issue
Of industry terminology.

1368
01:11:13,736 --> 01:11:18,105
You see, a lead is
One of the focus characters
In the film.

1369
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:20,808
You were probably
A lead background extra,

1370
01:11:20,810 --> 01:11:22,810
Which is more like
A set piece or a prop.

1371
01:11:22,812 --> 01:11:26,046
(quietly)
I had a pretty good
Role in that movie.

1372
01:11:26,048 --> 01:11:29,183
I was not a prop.

1373
01:11:29,185 --> 01:11:31,151
No reason to raise
Your voice, okay?

1374
01:11:31,153 --> 01:11:32,920
Who's raising their voice?

1375
01:11:32,922 --> 01:11:36,156
No reason to scream.
I think there's just
A miscommunication here.

1376
01:11:36,158 --> 01:11:38,859
What we're spoofing
Is a military courtroom drama

1377
01:11:38,861 --> 01:11:42,763
That had jack nicholson,
Tom cruise and
Denzel washington.

1378
01:11:42,765 --> 01:11:47,301
It wasn't
Denzel washington.
It was me.

1379
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:49,670
Okay?

1380
01:11:49,672 --> 01:11:54,007
I'm the actor
Who played the guy
Who did the code red.

1381
01:11:54,009 --> 01:11:56,009
Agree to disagree.

1382
01:11:56,011 --> 01:11:58,912
Why are we shooting this
In a spaceship?

1383
01:11:58,914 --> 01:12:00,681
Because that's
Where it happened.

1384
01:12:00,683 --> 01:12:03,217
You know what?
Maybe you oughta
Rent the movie.

1385
01:12:03,219 --> 01:12:05,853
Okay, 'cause it did not
Happen in a spaceship.

1386
01:12:05,855 --> 01:12:08,121
It was a courtroom drama.

1387
01:12:08,123 --> 01:12:11,325
Listen, i don't want
To fight with you, okay?

1388
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:13,361
All i want you to do
Is say the line

1389
01:12:13,363 --> 01:12:15,830
Exactly how
Denzel washington said it.

1390
01:12:15,832 --> 01:12:17,331
"you ordered the code red."

1391
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:20,501
I did not order
The code red.

1392
01:12:20,503 --> 01:12:23,203
I did it.

1393
01:12:23,205 --> 01:12:26,106
Okay? I'm the guy
That killed santiago.

1394
01:12:26,108 --> 01:12:28,676
Listen, dawg,
I am not a therapist.

1395
01:12:28,678 --> 01:12:31,979
All i need you to do
Is say the line exactly
How denzel said it.

1396
01:12:31,981 --> 01:12:33,714
Let me see the script.

1397
01:12:33,716 --> 01:12:35,916
Okay, come inside here.
You know, this is where...

1398
01:12:35,918 --> 01:12:38,552
I'm not gettin' in there.
What am i gettin' in there for?

1399
01:12:38,554 --> 01:12:41,355
Because this is
The courthouse,
The judge comes up here.

1400
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:44,024
No, the judge is over here,
And it's the moment...

1401
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:45,559
Whatever.
Listen, do the improv.

1402
01:12:45,561 --> 01:12:47,661
You'll be great.
He's gettin' into it.

1403
01:12:47,663 --> 01:12:49,830
Hey, you, uh...
Nicholson and cruise,

1404
01:12:49,832 --> 01:12:53,000
You said they were
Gonna do this, so
They're comin', right?

1405
01:12:53,002 --> 01:12:55,068
Absolutely not.
We lied.

1406
01:12:55,070 --> 01:12:58,038
Okay, whenever
You're ready.
And, cut.

1407
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:00,841
Randy.
Oh, hey, wendy.

1408
01:13:00,843 --> 01:13:03,010
How are you?
I'm good.

1409
01:13:03,012 --> 01:13:05,579
Is this a bad time?
Oh, no, i love you.

1410
01:13:05,581 --> 01:13:07,114
I mean,
Walk with me.

1411
01:13:07,116 --> 01:13:09,483
I was just
Talking to an extra.

1412
01:13:09,485 --> 01:13:11,752
I've missed you
The past few weeks.

1413
01:13:11,754 --> 01:13:14,021
Really?
Yeah.

1414
01:13:14,023 --> 01:13:16,891
Listen, i've just been
Thinking about something
You said to me over and over,

1415
01:13:16,893 --> 01:13:19,760
And i just wanted to
Come down here and get
Some closure on it.

1416
01:13:19,762 --> 01:13:22,963
Oh, no, listen,
I say a lot of things
That i don't mean.

1417
01:13:22,965 --> 01:13:25,098
What did i say?

1418
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:28,035
You said you loved me.

1419
01:13:28,037 --> 01:13:30,704
Might have been
One of those.

1420
01:13:30,706 --> 01:13:32,673
What did you think
About what i said
Or didn't say?

1421
01:13:32,675 --> 01:13:34,909
I probably didn't.
I don't remember.

1422
01:13:34,911 --> 01:13:36,577
I liked it.
I said it, i did.

1423
01:13:36,579 --> 01:13:38,913
I remember you were
Wearing a green dress.

1424
01:13:38,915 --> 01:13:40,414
So you do?

1425
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:42,917
Wendy, i wanna
Be honest with you.

1426
01:13:42,919 --> 01:13:45,052
I have a lot of
Commitment issues.

1427
01:13:45,054 --> 01:13:46,887
Would you marry me?

1428
01:13:46,889 --> 01:13:49,389
Problem! Randy, we got
A big friggin' problem.
Come on.

1429
01:13:49,391 --> 01:13:51,459
Wait, wait, wait.
Randy.

1430
01:13:51,461 --> 01:13:53,527
I'm sorry.
Go ahead.

1431
01:13:53,529 --> 01:13:55,996
I didn't even mean it.
Or i did. We can
Talk about it.

1432
01:14:01,269 --> 01:14:03,804
Hi.

1433
01:14:03,806 --> 01:14:07,074
You're wendy, right?
Yeah.

1434
01:14:09,711 --> 01:14:11,912
It's kind of
A secret,

1435
01:14:11,914 --> 01:14:14,882
But randy's planning
On proposing.

1436
01:14:14,884 --> 01:14:16,884
Oh, yeah?
Shh.

1437
01:14:16,886 --> 01:14:19,353
Okay.

1438
01:14:23,558 --> 01:14:25,626
Okay, calm down
What happened?

1439
01:14:25,628 --> 01:14:28,629
Just a minor issue, randy.
We're missing all of
Our footage.

1440
01:14:28,631 --> 01:14:31,031
We only have one tape.
Should we have
More than one?

1441
01:14:31,033 --> 01:14:34,034
Hey, news flash, randy.
We're supposed to have
35 tapes.

1442
01:14:34,036 --> 01:14:37,404
35?
Randy, where are all the tapes
That we bring you every day

1443
01:14:37,406 --> 01:14:39,874
For the last
Three weeks?

1444
01:14:39,876 --> 01:14:44,044
Okay, i sit here,
And somebody come in
And brings me a tape.

1445
01:14:44,046 --> 01:14:48,382
I don't know
What to do with it,
So i bring it back to 'em.

1446
01:14:48,384 --> 01:14:50,651
Can i make
An observation, randy?

1447
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:53,521
You're displaying symptoms
Of mild retardation.

1448
01:14:53,523 --> 01:14:56,323
Oh, now come...
Come on. Come on.

1449
01:14:56,325 --> 01:15:00,561
Randy, how many of the tapes
That we brought to you
Did you bring back to us?

1450
01:15:00,563 --> 01:15:02,530
All of 'em?

1451
01:15:02,532 --> 01:15:05,465
You're stressin' me out
Big time, randy.

1452
01:15:08,236 --> 01:15:10,437
I will play
The blame game.
What'd i do?

1453
01:15:10,439 --> 01:15:12,272
You screwed up
Big time, randy.

1454
01:15:12,274 --> 01:15:14,374
What's going on?
Idiot recorded over
All the footage.

1455
01:15:14,376 --> 01:15:16,744
Did i?
You did?

1456
01:15:16,746 --> 01:15:18,712
Tell him.

1457
01:15:18,714 --> 01:15:21,148
I just proposed,
And i'm pretty sure
She said no, and her hair

1458
01:15:21,150 --> 01:15:23,918
Smells like strawberries.
I'll probably never
Smell hair again.

1459
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:26,153
We don't have any tapes,
We don't have any footage.

1460
01:15:26,155 --> 01:15:27,955
This orangutan
Takes the tapes to his room

1461
01:15:27,957 --> 01:15:29,489
And does weird
Little thing with them,
Then he brings them back

1462
01:15:29,491 --> 01:15:31,491
And he records over them.
All of it?

1463
01:15:31,493 --> 01:15:33,226
All of it.

1464
01:15:33,228 --> 01:15:34,962
That's horrible.
Pinch me.
This ain't a dream.

1465
01:15:34,964 --> 01:15:37,230
Thanks, people.
Give yourselves
A pat on the back.

1466
01:15:37,232 --> 01:15:41,301
End of story.
Lester's money's gone.
You go and see lester.

1467
01:15:41,303 --> 01:15:44,605
You sort it out
With lester.
You complete prick.

1468
01:15:44,607 --> 01:15:47,541
And you two,
That stupid grin
On your face.

1469
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:49,910
We wanted to fire you
Three or four times, okay?

1470
01:15:49,912 --> 01:15:54,682
<i>yeah? Now you're fired!
Right? Comprende? Fuego!
Piss off!</i>

1471
01:15:54,684 --> 01:15:59,720
Out. Ben, do us a favor, son.
You go with 'em, all right?

1472
01:15:59,722 --> 01:16:03,356
Otherwise, i'll get
Richard fucking tyson
And sort you smart out.

1473
01:16:03,358 --> 01:16:05,593
Oh, great, i'm fired.
How can this happen?

1474
01:16:05,595 --> 01:16:08,028
Wes, get in here
And sort this out.

1475
01:16:08,030 --> 01:16:09,830
You left me
In the pod.

1476
01:16:09,832 --> 01:16:12,600
I'm sorry i didn't
Rent your movie.

1477
01:16:12,602 --> 01:16:15,970
I don't wanna be
Fired. I'm sorry, okay?

1478
01:16:15,972 --> 01:16:17,571
Randy.
I'm sorry.

1479
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:20,741
I wanted to talk
To you about the ring.

1480
01:16:20,743 --> 01:16:22,476
I get it, okay?
You don't wanna marry me.

1481
01:16:22,478 --> 01:16:26,446
Randy. Randy,
Here's your last paycheck.

1482
01:16:26,448 --> 01:16:28,415
Let me guess. Another check
Made out to ben.

1483
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:30,818
I'll tell you what.
I'm not ben, okay?

1484
01:16:30,820 --> 01:16:33,320
I'm not ben,
I'm not ben,
I'm not ben,

1485
01:16:33,322 --> 01:16:35,322
I'm not ben,
I'm not ben.

1486
01:16:35,324 --> 01:16:38,225
I'm randy. R-a-n-d-y. Randy.

1487
01:16:38,227 --> 01:16:42,329
The bank doesn't even
Accept these.
I can't even cash 'em.

1488
01:16:42,331 --> 01:16:44,798
That was to randy eubanks.

1489
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,366
Do you have any tape?

1490
01:16:46,368 --> 01:16:48,636
No.
Okay.

1491
01:16:48,638 --> 01:16:52,205
Great. No tape!
I wish i was ben.

1492
01:16:52,207 --> 01:16:53,741
Maybe then you'd
Remember my name.

1493
01:16:53,743 --> 01:16:57,044
Maybe then
You'd like me,
Not hate me.

1494
01:16:57,046 --> 01:17:00,714
I like my chest hair.
I don't care if you do.

1495
01:17:00,716 --> 01:17:03,383
I wish i was ben.
I wish i was ben!

1496
01:17:03,385 --> 01:17:06,486
I wish i was ben.

1497
01:17:12,393 --> 01:17:15,929
I don't even care anymore.
Stupid ring.

1498
01:17:15,931 --> 01:17:17,931
Sorry, grandma.

1499
01:17:27,275 --> 01:17:29,576
(cat yowls)

1500
01:17:42,824 --> 01:17:47,728
(crying loudly)

1501
01:17:47,730 --> 01:17:50,931
Why does it feel
So good to cry?

1502
01:17:50,933 --> 01:17:54,935
I feel like i've never cried
Until this day.

1503
01:18:10,185 --> 01:18:12,686
What a mess.

1504
01:18:14,022 --> 01:18:16,056
God, he is a moron.

1505
01:18:16,058 --> 01:18:17,858
Randy. Randy?

1506
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:20,060
What the hell
Are you doin' here?

1507
01:18:20,062 --> 01:18:21,862
I thought i
Took away your key.

1508
01:18:21,864 --> 01:18:24,564
What key? I don't
Have a key.
Your door's open.

1509
01:18:24,566 --> 01:18:27,034
You shut up.
You do not speak
Unless you are spoken to.

1510
01:18:27,036 --> 01:18:28,802
You just spoke to me.

1511
01:18:28,804 --> 01:18:32,740
I asked you nicely
To shut your mouth,
But you just couldn't do it.

1512
01:18:32,742 --> 01:18:35,075
You're gonna get
A visit from mr. Belt.

1513
01:18:35,077 --> 01:18:36,543
What belt?
This belt.

1514
01:18:36,545 --> 01:18:38,946
The one that's
Gonna hit you
Across your face.

1515
01:18:38,948 --> 01:18:41,481
Oh, that doesn't feel good.
There's no belt.

1516
01:18:41,483 --> 01:18:43,450
Maybe you'll feel it
If it hits your little pecker.

1517
01:18:43,452 --> 01:18:46,954
Oh, doesn't feel good.
Hurts when it hits the tip.

1518
01:18:46,956 --> 01:18:49,757
You're creepin' me out a little
Bit, and i think you got me
Confused with someone else.

1519
01:18:49,759 --> 01:18:53,627
I ain't confused, randy,
You chubby little bastard.
Now you shut up.

1520
01:18:53,629 --> 01:18:55,695
Why don't you
Just calm down--
Shut it!

1521
01:18:55,697 --> 01:18:57,597
Ha!
I don't have time for this.

1522
01:18:57,599 --> 01:18:59,699
Some people at work
Are worried about you,

1523
01:18:59,701 --> 01:19:03,237
So i said i'd come by
And check on you.
It really stinks in here.

1524
01:19:03,239 --> 01:19:05,572
Nipple shot,
Nipple shot,
Pecker shot.

1525
01:19:05,574 --> 01:19:07,507
Just calm down.
Priorities, priorities.

1526
01:19:07,509 --> 01:19:09,243
What is wrong with you?
Priorities.

1527
01:19:09,245 --> 01:19:11,745
Daddy's gotta
Take a piss.

1528
01:19:11,747 --> 01:19:15,482
Daddy feels like
A camel today.

1529
01:19:15,484 --> 01:19:18,451
I need some more
Help with this.

1530
01:19:18,453 --> 01:19:21,054
Unload. Unload.

1531
01:19:23,424 --> 01:19:25,659
Daddy went in
His shorts again.

1532
01:19:27,128 --> 01:19:29,462
Wes: you need water?
Are you okay?

1533
01:19:29,464 --> 01:19:31,331
(growls)

1534
01:19:42,911 --> 01:19:45,345
Thanks.
You're welcome, randy.

1535
01:19:51,986 --> 01:19:54,221
I told you. See?

1536
01:19:54,223 --> 01:19:57,390
I'm pretending like
I didn't see that.
It scares me.

1537
01:19:58,559 --> 01:20:00,894
Don't be a wussy.
Come on.

1538
01:20:00,896 --> 01:20:03,931
Jog. Come on, randy.

1539
01:20:03,933 --> 01:20:06,800
Five more miles.
Keep it goin'.

1540
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:08,001
Randy? Whoa, whoa,
Whoa. Randy?

1541
01:20:08,003 --> 01:20:11,471
(ice cream truck
Music jingling)

1542
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:13,606
Randy?

1543
01:20:15,276 --> 01:20:17,845
Randy! Ra...

1544
01:20:20,949 --> 01:20:25,085
"the boy found the tricycle
And was overwhelmed with joy,

1545
01:20:25,087 --> 01:20:28,655
"a joy he hadn't felt
Since he was in middle school

1546
01:20:28,657 --> 01:20:32,059
"when he got a single
During kickball to almost
Tie the game up,

1547
01:20:32,061 --> 01:20:36,063
"even though he got
Thrown out at second
And they lost.

1548
01:20:36,065 --> 01:20:37,865
The end."

1549
01:20:37,867 --> 01:20:41,434
This is a really
Great script,
Huh, ernie?

1550
01:20:41,436 --> 01:20:43,937
Hey, let's
Read it again.

1551
01:20:43,939 --> 01:20:49,142
That's a good idea.
Would you like that,
Randy? Yeah?

1552
01:20:49,144 --> 01:20:53,080
"once upon a time, there were
Two dead, naked bodies."

1553
01:20:54,548 --> 01:20:56,383
Come on,
Snap out of it.

1554
01:20:56,385 --> 01:20:58,185
I can't breathe.
Oh, you can breathe.

1555
01:20:58,187 --> 01:20:59,719
Have some more.

1556
01:20:59,721 --> 01:21:01,989
You ready
To quit faking?

1557
01:21:01,991 --> 01:21:04,791
Oh. Oh, great.
Now he's playing dead.

1558
01:21:04,793 --> 01:21:07,727
Playing dead, randy?
Is that what
You're gonna do?

1559
01:21:07,729 --> 01:21:10,097
Okay, he's just
Gonna play dead.

1560
01:21:10,099 --> 01:21:12,432
All right, randy.
We're gonna leave.

1561
01:21:12,434 --> 01:21:14,701
We're leaving, randy.
Bye-bye.

1562
01:21:23,444 --> 01:21:27,047
Where do you think
You're goin'?
I'm comin' with you.

1563
01:21:27,049 --> 01:21:29,582
Go home, boy,
Or you'll feel
The back of my hand.

1564
01:21:29,584 --> 01:21:31,618
But i finished my work.

1565
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:33,620
Go home or i'll give you
A kick in the ass.

1566
01:21:33,622 --> 01:21:36,623
I need you to stay here
And look after the place
For me while i'm away.

1567
01:21:36,625 --> 01:21:39,626
But, dad, i can fight.

1568
01:21:44,532 --> 01:21:47,067
No, you can't.
Yes, i can.

1569
01:21:47,069 --> 01:21:49,803
It's our wits
That make us men,

1570
01:21:49,805 --> 01:21:52,806
And you do not
Have any wits.
You've none at all.

1571
01:21:52,808 --> 01:21:55,075
In fact, you're
Downright stupid.

1572
01:21:55,077 --> 01:21:58,345
What are you doin'
With that stupid
Paint on your face?

1573
01:21:58,347 --> 01:22:00,847
So i can be
A warrior like...
Give me that

1574
01:22:00,849 --> 01:22:02,715
Before you cut
Your bollocks off.

1575
01:22:02,717 --> 01:22:05,718
In fact, if you
Got into a fight,

1576
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:10,490
You'd probably
Run away and piss yourself.

1577
01:22:10,492 --> 01:22:14,995
Jesus christ. You cannot
Even stay awake for
Five minutes.

1578
01:22:16,130 --> 01:22:18,731
(thudding sound)

1579
01:22:24,138 --> 01:22:26,739
(deep inhalation)
I'm alive!

1580
01:22:26,741 --> 01:22:29,142
It was a joke.
You're an asshole.

1581
01:22:34,048 --> 01:22:39,453
The last thing i remember
Is coming into my apartment
Right after i was fired,

1582
01:22:39,455 --> 01:22:42,822
And then, i sat here...

1583
01:22:42,824 --> 01:22:45,725
Did that just happen?
I've been a real jerk to you.

1584
01:22:45,727 --> 01:22:47,995
No, you haven't.
Yes, i have.

1585
01:22:47,997 --> 01:22:50,163
No, we're friends.
No, we're not.

1586
01:22:50,165 --> 01:22:52,466
No, we're not friends.
We're best friends.

1587
01:22:52,468 --> 01:22:55,369
All the accidents
At work...
I'm real accident-prone.

1588
01:22:55,371 --> 01:22:58,338
Your tricycle script.
I know. I thought
That was weird.

1589
01:22:58,340 --> 01:23:02,209
Did i tell you that i had
The same idea for a script?
I even wrote it.

1590
01:23:02,211 --> 01:23:04,044
I know. It was yours.

1591
01:23:04,046 --> 01:23:06,046
That's why we're
Best friends.
We think alike.

1592
01:23:06,048 --> 01:23:08,448
And act alike.
We should get t-shirts.

1593
01:23:08,450 --> 01:23:10,484
Oh, my god.
You are so stupid.

1594
01:23:10,486 --> 01:23:12,152
Okay, now you're
Being mean.

1595
01:23:12,154 --> 01:23:14,354
And best friends don't
Treat each other that way.

1596
01:23:14,356 --> 01:23:18,025
Randy, i stole
Your script.

1597
01:23:18,027 --> 01:23:19,826
I took it from you
When you were sleeping
Right there.

1598
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:24,498
I broke your desk,
I set off your fire alarm,
You are not accident-prone.

1599
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:27,167
Okay, just leave it there.

1600
01:23:27,169 --> 01:23:30,970
So i did everything
Else to you... Just
Leave it, okay?

1601
01:23:30,972 --> 01:23:32,705
I did everything
Else to you.

1602
01:23:32,707 --> 01:23:34,374
I've been a real jerk.

1603
01:23:34,376 --> 01:23:37,110
I've been making your life
A living hell, and i'm sorry.

1604
01:23:37,112 --> 01:23:40,747
I can see what
Your hand is doing.
I can see it.

1605
01:23:43,784 --> 01:23:46,619
I'm trying to be nice to you
Here, randy, and you're
Being a jerk about it.

1606
01:23:46,621 --> 01:23:50,657
I came here to give you
Your job back and ask you
To direct the tricycle script,

1607
01:23:50,659 --> 01:23:53,160
You dick!

1608
01:23:56,064 --> 01:23:59,632
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't
Have called you that.

1609
01:24:00,701 --> 01:24:02,902
It's okay.

1610
01:24:03,804 --> 01:24:05,105
It's okay, buddy.

1611
01:24:05,107 --> 01:24:08,608
Thanks?
It's all right.

1612
01:24:09,477 --> 01:24:12,312
Randy. Randy?
Yeah?

1613
01:24:12,314 --> 01:24:16,316
You're in your underwear.
I know. It's okay.

1614
01:24:25,859 --> 01:24:28,562
Can i sit here?
Sure.

1615
01:24:28,564 --> 01:24:30,797
Wendy, before
You say anything,

1616
01:24:30,799 --> 01:24:34,101
I just have to apologize
For leaving you at
The studio a few days ago.

1617
01:24:34,103 --> 01:24:36,636
It's okay.
I wanted to call.

1618
01:24:36,638 --> 01:24:40,673
I just, uh... I've just
Been dealing with it
In my own way.

1619
01:24:40,675 --> 01:24:44,244
I've... I've been
Out of town.

1620
01:24:44,246 --> 01:24:46,513
Huh?
Yeah.

1621
01:24:46,515 --> 01:24:49,516
I've been at the hamptons.
It's where i go
To gather my thoughts.

1622
01:24:49,518 --> 01:24:52,185
Randy, i've been
With you the last
Two days.

1623
01:24:52,187 --> 01:24:54,321
I don't know what
You're talking about,

1624
01:24:54,323 --> 01:24:57,124
But i was definitely at
The hampton inn.

1625
01:24:57,126 --> 01:25:00,994
Wendy, i like you,
And, uh...

1626
01:25:00,996 --> 01:25:03,463
I've always
Liked you, wendy.

1627
01:25:03,465 --> 01:25:07,567
I know i was a little fast
In giving you the ring
And asking you to marry me,

1628
01:25:07,569 --> 01:25:09,869
And i know you
Don't want to,
And it's okay.

1629
01:25:09,871 --> 01:25:11,404
I just hope that we
Can still be friends.

1630
01:25:11,406 --> 01:25:13,406
No, i do.
Me, too.

1631
01:25:13,408 --> 01:25:15,708
I love your
Friendship and...
No.

1632
01:25:15,710 --> 01:25:18,345
I would not--
Listen to me,
'cause i mean it.

1633
01:25:18,347 --> 01:25:23,683
I wouldn't do anything ever
To sacrifice our friendship.

1634
01:25:23,685 --> 01:25:26,119
I wanna marry you.
Except for that.

1635
01:25:26,121 --> 01:25:28,721
Our friendship's gone.
You're gonna be my wife.

1636
01:25:28,723 --> 01:25:30,857
Are you saying...
You really wanna...

1637
01:25:30,859 --> 01:25:33,527
I can't breathe
Right now.

1638
01:25:33,529 --> 01:25:35,828
I might have thrown
The ring into
The l.A. River.

1639
01:25:35,830 --> 01:25:37,964
No, you didn't.
No, i did.

1640
01:25:37,966 --> 01:25:40,367
I threw it hard.
I threw it really far.
I'm a baseball player.

1641
01:25:40,369 --> 01:25:42,702
No, you didn't.
No, i did.
I know what i did.

1642
01:25:42,704 --> 01:25:45,738
I threw it.
Are you calling me
A liar again?

1643
01:25:45,740 --> 01:25:50,043
Randy, i've, uh,
Had it the whole time.

1644
01:25:50,045 --> 01:25:53,480
Wait a second.
This is my grandma's
Cubic zirconium...

1645
01:25:53,482 --> 01:25:56,149
I mean, diamond.

1646
01:25:56,151 --> 01:25:59,252
So i thought
It was just
The box that i threw.

1647
01:25:59,254 --> 01:26:01,221
I guess it...

1648
01:26:01,223 --> 01:26:04,224
So we're doin' this?
I mean, we're...

1649
01:26:04,226 --> 01:26:06,025
We're really
Getting married.

1650
01:26:06,027 --> 01:26:08,428
I guess so.
Okay.

1651
01:26:08,430 --> 01:26:10,897
Well, first things first.

1652
01:26:12,333 --> 01:26:16,670
Oh! This feels good.
It feels like,
It feels right.

1653
01:26:16,672 --> 01:26:18,471
That's the wrong finger.

1654
01:26:18,473 --> 01:26:20,640
Of course it is.
Let me try that again.

1655
01:26:20,642 --> 01:26:22,742
All right.

1656
01:26:22,744 --> 01:26:25,645
It feels right,
Doesn't it?
It feels perfect.

1657
01:26:25,647 --> 01:26:28,047
Still the wrong finger.
Okay, we'll try
That again.

1658
01:26:28,049 --> 01:26:30,383
It would be
This finger.
I know that.

1659
01:26:30,385 --> 01:26:32,185
So i guess this means
We should kiss.

1660
01:26:32,187 --> 01:26:34,854
Okay.
Yeah. I mean,
It's standard.

1661
01:26:34,856 --> 01:26:37,023
Standard married...

1662
01:26:37,025 --> 01:26:39,092
Um, just to warn you...

1663
01:26:39,094 --> 01:26:41,160
Just to warn you...

1664
01:26:41,162 --> 01:26:44,264
I have never
Kissed a woman.

1665
01:26:44,266 --> 01:26:46,999
And i've been really
Excited about this,

1666
01:26:47,001 --> 01:26:50,103
So i'm just gonna go
And i'm feeling
Really romantic right now.

1667
01:26:50,105 --> 01:26:52,739
I'm just gonna
Do this, okay?
Okay.

1668
01:26:59,213 --> 01:27:01,448
I'm kissing your nose,
Aren't i?

1669
01:27:01,450 --> 01:27:03,383
Uh-huh.

1670
01:27:03,385 --> 01:27:05,885
I'm sorry. I've just
Never done this before.

1671
01:27:05,887 --> 01:27:09,289
It's okay.
I should probably stop
Grabbing your face.

1672
01:27:09,291 --> 01:27:11,358
Okay.
Okay?

1673
01:27:13,994 --> 01:27:16,162
Just pretend like
That never happened.

1674
01:27:18,599 --> 01:27:21,000
I'm sorry.

1675
01:27:21,002 --> 01:27:26,373
So... It's
Me and you now.

1676
01:27:26,375 --> 01:27:28,875
Yeah.

1677
01:27:28,877 --> 01:27:31,378
It's just me and you.

1678
01:27:34,615 --> 01:27:37,116
What?
Hmm?

1679
01:27:38,352 --> 01:27:40,887
So apparently,

1680
01:27:40,889 --> 01:27:44,157
I ordered something from
Yugoslavia last night.

1681
01:27:47,828 --> 01:27:50,930
Yeah. It's a bride.

1682
01:27:52,032 --> 01:27:54,834
She'll be here tomorrow.

1683
01:28:06,914 --> 01:28:09,015
You're not at
Quizno's now, okay?

1684
01:28:09,017 --> 01:28:11,050
I need you
To give me pacino.

1685
01:28:11,052 --> 01:28:13,085
Right now, you're
Giving me boo radley.

1686
01:28:13,087 --> 01:28:15,955
Access your inner child.
He's drunk today!

1687
01:28:15,957 --> 01:28:20,427
(speaking spanish)

1688
01:28:25,733 --> 01:28:28,868
Ready?
Yeah, i'm ready.
I been ready all day.

1689
01:28:28,870 --> 01:28:31,604
I'm sorry.
Okay, slower, slower.
You're goin' too fast.

1690
01:28:31,606 --> 01:28:35,775
Go faster.
Ernie, get outta the way.
Get outta the way. Ow!

1691
01:28:35,777 --> 01:28:38,311
Oh, hit me in
The head. Thanks.

1692
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:42,482
And... Cut!
Come on, kid,
It's your big moment.

1693
01:28:42,484 --> 01:28:44,884
Cut! Cut!

1694
01:28:44,886 --> 01:28:47,721
Forget it. Action.

1695
01:28:47,723 --> 01:28:49,889
Chicken.

1696
01:28:49,891 --> 01:28:52,091
That was it.

1697
01:28:52,093 --> 01:28:55,362
It just came to me
One night.

1698
01:28:55,364 --> 01:28:59,065
Flavor number 32,
Chicken ice cream.

1699
01:28:59,067 --> 01:29:02,168
Everybody loves chicken.
Everybody eats chicken.

1700
01:29:02,170 --> 01:29:05,839
You put the rainbow
Sprinkles on it for the kids,

1701
01:29:05,841 --> 01:29:07,507
Call it chicken salad.

1702
01:29:07,509 --> 01:29:10,577
I know it sounds...
That sounds silly.

1703
01:29:10,579 --> 01:29:13,279
So anyway, the studio...

1704
01:29:13,281 --> 01:29:17,149
Uh, pretty much went under,

1705
01:29:17,151 --> 01:29:19,986
And i lost pretty much
Everything i had,

1706
01:29:19,988 --> 01:29:22,355
But it was
A blessing in disguise,

1707
01:29:22,357 --> 01:29:24,891
Because i think
It gave me the time

1708
01:29:24,893 --> 01:29:29,462
To really pursue
My calling,

1709
01:29:29,464 --> 01:29:32,999
My life calling
Which is, of course,

1710
01:29:33,001 --> 01:29:37,103
Opening up
My ice cream shop again,

1711
01:29:37,105 --> 01:29:42,108
And i called it
32 flavors.

1712
01:29:42,110 --> 01:29:44,744
Beat that,
Mr. Robbins.

1713
01:29:44,746 --> 01:29:47,280
Woman: actually, i think
They have 50 flavors now.

1714
01:29:47,282 --> 01:29:50,149
Oh, 50 flavors.
What are you talking about?

1715
01:29:50,151 --> 01:29:52,285
No, they do.
They have,
Like, 50 flavors.

1716
01:29:52,287 --> 01:29:55,321
Don't say that.
Don't say it again.

1717
01:29:55,323 --> 01:29:58,157
You know, we really
Only need one camera here.

1718
01:29:58,159 --> 01:30:00,460
If you'd put your camera
Down, please, and leave.

1719
01:30:00,462 --> 01:30:02,562
I'm trying to speak
To the...

1720
01:30:02,564 --> 01:30:04,931
Just put it down.
I'm sorry.

1721
01:30:04,933 --> 01:30:07,934
I'm starting to sweat.

1722
01:30:13,373 --> 01:30:16,976
Fifty flavors.
Who told her that? Shit.

1723
01:30:18,512 --> 01:30:21,180
So we wrapped on
The tricycle picture,
It went great.

1724
01:30:21,182 --> 01:30:24,651
No one actually watched it,
Which was good because

1725
01:30:24,653 --> 01:30:28,721
I'm actually trying
To let that part of me go.

1726
01:30:28,723 --> 01:30:33,225
The film was not
About my cousin.
It was about me.

1727
01:30:33,227 --> 01:30:37,196
I'm so proud
Of you, honey.
Thanks, babe.

1728
01:30:37,198 --> 01:30:39,332
But i am working on
A brand-new script.

1729
01:30:39,334 --> 01:30:41,768
It's wonderful.
It's about a small boy
Who's afraid of fire,

1730
01:30:41,770 --> 01:30:46,205
Because his dad would
Actually put out cigars
On his neck.

1731
01:30:46,207 --> 01:30:48,341
That one's about
My cousin.

1732
01:30:48,343 --> 01:30:50,710
That one's about
My cousin, so...

1733
01:30:50,712 --> 01:30:52,612
So, we're married now.

1734
01:30:52,614 --> 01:30:56,415
Yeah, it's goin' great.
What else is new?

1735
01:30:56,417 --> 01:30:59,552
Oh, yeah, we had
Coitus last night.

1736
01:30:59,554 --> 01:31:01,454
Yes, we did.

1737
01:31:01,456 --> 01:31:05,792
But, baby, can you
Never call it coitus
Ever again?

1738
01:31:05,794 --> 01:31:07,594
Oh, yeah.
Sorry, babe.

1739
01:31:07,596 --> 01:31:11,297
Hey, i'm gonna go
Get that coffee for you.
She's a coffee nut.

1740
01:31:12,633 --> 01:31:16,603
So... I think marriage life
Is really good for us.

1741
01:31:16,605 --> 01:31:18,270
Especially randy.

1742
01:31:18,272 --> 01:31:22,575
He's changed so much,
You probably wouldn't
Even recognize him.

1743
01:31:22,577 --> 01:31:25,211
He's really learning
How to deal with his past.

1744
01:31:25,213 --> 01:31:28,080
He's really maturing.

1745
01:31:28,082 --> 01:31:30,917
He's just growing up.

1746
01:31:30,919 --> 01:31:33,185
Randy?

1747
01:31:33,187 --> 01:31:35,354
Are you getting sleepy?

1748
01:31:39,226 --> 01:31:41,394
(bell rings)

1749
01:31:41,396 --> 01:31:44,864
You shut up,
You shut up.
Pecker, pecker!

1750
01:31:44,866 --> 01:31:48,467
Pecker. Yah, yah.
Pecker, pecker.

1751
01:31:48,469 --> 01:31:52,505
Now i'm tired,
And daddy's gonna
Take a piss.

1752
01:31:53,908 --> 01:31:56,809
So wes and i decided
To start a production company.

1753
01:31:56,811 --> 01:31:59,913
It's going great.
I'm finally living
Out my dreams,

1754
01:31:59,915 --> 01:32:01,614
Which is amazing.

1755
01:32:01,616 --> 01:32:03,650
With wes and ben's,
You're getting
An amazing deal.

1756
01:32:03,652 --> 01:32:06,920
We can take your script
And make it into
A blockbuster.

1757
01:32:06,922 --> 01:32:09,388
I'm talking big.
Let me talk about quality.

1758
01:32:09,390 --> 01:32:12,191
Capital "q."
(bb gun fires)

1759
01:32:18,165 --> 01:32:20,667
Randy: why are you crying?

1760
01:32:26,306 --> 01:32:28,675
Yes. I'm gonna enjoy this.

1761
01:32:28,677 --> 01:32:31,711
So i'm still learning
American law.

1762
01:32:31,713 --> 01:32:34,948
Apparently you need
Some kind of a permit

1763
01:32:34,950 --> 01:32:37,116
So that you can
Carry a gun.

1764
01:32:37,118 --> 01:32:39,752
And they don't like it
When you shoot someone,
I can tell you that.

1765
01:32:39,754 --> 01:32:44,390
I went abroad,
And i'm rooming with lester.

1766
01:32:44,392 --> 01:32:46,793
In a cell with lester.

1767
01:32:46,795 --> 01:32:50,162
But you know,
We got a theater group goin'.

1768
01:32:50,164 --> 01:32:53,132
<i>everybody's involved.
It's mamma mia!</i>

1769
01:32:53,134 --> 01:32:56,803
Yeah, but we've had to
Push it back.

1770
01:32:56,805 --> 01:33:00,707
Our lead guy
Got stabbed in the showers
By the understudy.

1771
01:33:00,709 --> 01:33:04,944
Apparently picked up
The wrong piece of soap.

1772
01:33:04,946 --> 01:33:06,913
(sighs)

1773
01:33:06,915 --> 01:33:09,749
The show will go on.

1774
01:33:17,190 --> 01:33:19,258
I know. It's okay.
You want whipped cream.

1775
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:22,662
I hope you just didn't
Miss your chance
To read your poem.

1776
01:33:22,664 --> 01:33:23,763
(shrieks)

1777
01:33:30,470 --> 01:33:33,740
This is unbelievable.
Everyone else sees
This, right?

1778
01:33:33,742 --> 01:33:35,608
You are a nightmare.

1779
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:37,610
An absolute nightmare
To work with.

1780
01:33:37,612 --> 01:33:40,312
Yeah, cheryl.
Why don't you
Say something?

1781
01:33:40,314 --> 01:33:42,148
Come on, cheryl.
Say something.

1782
01:33:42,150 --> 01:33:44,150
I'm on my period,
I'm grouchy,
I don't wanna talk.

1783
01:33:44,152 --> 01:33:46,185
So i know randy's an idiot,

1784
01:33:46,187 --> 01:33:49,388
But he did help me
To find my gift.

1785
01:33:49,390 --> 01:33:51,490
My gift of makeup.

1786
01:33:51,492 --> 01:33:53,492
I started my own
Makeup line.

1787
01:33:53,494 --> 01:33:55,995
I actually named it
After randy.

1788
01:33:55,997 --> 01:33:59,165
It's called... Ignorance.

1789
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:04,771
Randy doesn't get it,
But, oh well.

1790
01:34:08,608 --> 01:34:11,510
Booger!

1791
01:34:13,647 --> 01:34:15,782
He was trying
To make me laugh.

1792
01:34:15,784 --> 01:34:18,217
Apparently, there was
Some mix-up thing

1793
01:34:18,219 --> 01:34:20,119
With randy
And the internet.

1794
01:34:20,121 --> 01:34:24,924
I solved that problem
For him, and i'm married.

1795
01:34:24,926 --> 01:34:27,493
Reached my ultimate goal.

1796
01:34:27,495 --> 01:34:30,529
So... Where is she from?

1797
01:34:30,531 --> 01:34:34,067
Uh...

1798
01:34:34,069 --> 01:34:37,436
The republic
Of yugoslavia.

1799
01:34:37,438 --> 01:34:39,672
Not from around here.

1800
01:34:39,674 --> 01:34:42,175
It's funny
How these things work out.

1801
01:34:42,177 --> 01:34:44,376
Because i actually
Was thinking about

1802
01:34:44,378 --> 01:34:46,478
Buying a wife
On the internet.

1803
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:49,281
But my credit card--
I was way, way over the limit,

1804
01:34:49,283 --> 01:34:51,851
So when randy came
To me with this,

1805
01:34:51,853 --> 01:34:53,720
I jumped on it, so...

1806
01:34:53,722 --> 01:34:56,889
Originally, i was
Gonna go asian,

1807
01:34:56,891 --> 01:35:01,761
But i think this actually
Worked out better for me.

1808
01:35:01,763 --> 01:35:05,531
So, um... And we're
Really, really happy.

1809
01:35:05,533 --> 01:35:09,969
We are...
You're happy, right?

1810
01:35:09,971 --> 01:35:13,706
(speaking spanish)

1811
01:35:18,478 --> 01:35:21,647
I've never been fired
So many times in a day.

1812
01:35:21,649 --> 01:35:23,582
Man: cut.

1813
01:35:24,952 --> 01:35:26,853
I'm pumped.
I'm friggin' pumped.

1814
01:35:26,855 --> 01:35:29,321
Listen to this.
I got a job as a disc jockey.

1815
01:35:29,323 --> 01:35:30,957
I'm bart the deejay.

1816
01:35:30,959 --> 01:35:34,393
That's tight, right?
I'm working for z94.3 fm.

1817
01:35:34,395 --> 01:35:36,362
They gave me
This cool time slot.

1818
01:35:36,364 --> 01:35:38,998
I'm working mondays,
2:00 to 5:00 a.M.

1819
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,267
I'm doin' this thing
On the air now.

1820
01:35:41,269 --> 01:35:44,904
I'm, like, what up? Boom.
I'm goin' bart-listic on you.

1821
01:35:44,906 --> 01:35:48,741
Everyone in the studio's,
Like, that's tight.

1822
01:35:48,743 --> 01:35:50,743
I'm pretty much coverin'
All the big stuff.

1823
01:35:50,745 --> 01:35:53,913
I'm doin' intersections,
Cars, water main breaks.

1824
01:35:53,915 --> 01:35:56,548
I'm doing traffic.
Mostly traffic.

1825
01:35:56,550 --> 01:35:58,851
But let's be honest.

1826
01:35:58,853 --> 01:36:01,453
Being on the radio
Doesn't hurt in
The ass department, right?

1827
01:36:01,455 --> 01:36:04,290
Boom! We're gettin'
Bart-listic on you.

1828
01:36:06,626 --> 01:36:10,963
(high-pitched vocalizing)
Man: musical.

1829
01:36:10,965 --> 01:36:12,899
Marker.

1830
01:36:17,838 --> 01:36:20,572
Wes' ideas
Are very good,

1831
01:36:20,574 --> 01:36:23,375
And i should
Listen to him more.

1832
01:36:23,377 --> 01:36:25,377
Is that too many metaphors?

1833
01:36:25,379 --> 01:36:28,848
Maybe it is.
(laughter)

1834
01:36:31,418 --> 01:36:33,920
Why aren't you laughin'?

1835
01:36:33,922 --> 01:36:36,055
Why couldn't i have
Thought of that first?

1836
01:36:36,057 --> 01:36:39,792
(airplane overhead)
Hit the deck!

1837
01:36:41,528 --> 01:36:44,596
He started to struggle,
And i started to
Beat him in the head,

1838
01:36:44,598 --> 01:36:47,033
Again and again and again.

1839
01:36:50,804 --> 01:36:53,139
But they ordered us
To do it.

1840
01:36:53,141 --> 01:36:55,774
Bobby? What's his name?

1841
01:36:55,776 --> 01:36:58,744
It's randy.
Randy?

1842
01:36:58,746 --> 01:37:00,346
Randy?

1843
01:37:00,348 --> 01:37:04,951
'cause i'm uncomfortable
Being nude in front of
Other people.

1844
01:37:04,953 --> 01:37:08,254
Never let go.
Promise you'll
Never let go.

1845
01:37:08,256 --> 01:37:10,422
I got hot cocoa.

1846
01:37:10,424 --> 01:37:14,426
I'm starting to lose
My power of sight.

1847
01:37:15,562 --> 01:37:17,696
Oh, you got me.

1848
01:37:20,433 --> 01:37:22,034
Push it. Push
The fucking button!

1849
01:37:22,036 --> 01:37:24,570
(all yelling)

1850
01:37:24,572 --> 01:37:26,772
Let me talk to him.

1851
01:37:26,774 --> 01:37:29,641
Dad, it's me. Listen,
What you're doing

1852
01:37:29,643 --> 01:37:31,077
Is a very brave thing.

1853
01:37:31,079 --> 01:37:32,912
So...

1854
01:37:32,914 --> 01:37:35,214
So stupid.
What a stupid opening.

1855
01:37:35,216 --> 01:37:38,017
Stupid, stupid.

1856
01:37:38,019 --> 01:37:40,219
...Over at
Craft services.

1857
01:37:40,221 --> 01:37:41,754
(imitates gunfire)

1858
01:37:41,756 --> 01:37:43,455
You screwed up
Big time, randy.

1859
01:37:43,457 --> 01:37:46,558
Can i help you?

1860
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:48,727
Too late.

1861
01:37:48,729 --> 01:37:51,097
I think you're lost.

1862
01:37:51,099 --> 01:37:53,599
Did you call cut
Already?

1863
01:37:53,601 --> 01:37:56,635
Can i go home
And get my contacts?
No!!

1864
01:37:56,637 --> 01:38:00,273
Look right over there
At the card and read it.

1865
01:38:00,275 --> 01:38:03,009
Yeah, we speak english.

1866
01:38:03,011 --> 01:38:05,511
We just find it easier
To never do it.

1867
01:38:05,513 --> 01:38:07,613
We don't have
To work very hard.

1868
01:38:07,615 --> 01:38:10,316
We get out of jobs
That we don't wanna do.

1869
01:38:10,318 --> 01:38:13,920
And they can't fire us.
That's a big plus.

1870
01:38:13,922 --> 01:38:16,122
Yeah. Very.

1871
01:38:16,124 --> 01:38:18,357
Can you guys
Move your car?
It's in my spot.

1872
01:38:18,359 --> 01:38:20,326
<i>no ingles.</i>

1873
01:38:20,328 --> 01:38:23,162
(speaking spanish)

1874
01:38:24,597 --> 01:38:26,498
Great. I don't
Speak spanish.

1875
01:38:27,801 --> 01:38:31,003
So it's the big day.
Oh!

1876
01:38:33,373 --> 01:38:35,707
So it's the big day.
Oh!

1877
01:38:36,944 --> 01:38:40,712
I got it.
So today's the big day. Oh!

1878
01:38:40,714 --> 01:38:42,982
It's the start of...

1879
01:38:42,984 --> 01:38:45,717
Oh, i get it now.
You're no.

1880
01:38:46,586 --> 01:38:48,787
So it's the big day.

1881
01:38:50,590 --> 01:38:54,060
Action. I work best
Under pressure.

1882
01:38:56,529 --> 01:38:58,831
I forget you're no
When you said this.

1883
01:38:59,933 --> 01:39:02,301
So it's the big day.
Oh!

1884
01:39:02,303 --> 01:39:04,570
(laughter)

1885
01:39:04,572 --> 01:39:06,705
I didn't even mess up.
