1
00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:03,640
<i>Harley Wilkes was your father.
He left you his practice.</i>

2
00:00:03,641 --> 00:00:05,541
Zoe knows about us.

3
00:00:05,542 --> 00:00:07,327
<i>WADE: Why you stopped our little
frolic the other night?</i>

4
00:00:07,328 --> 00:00:09,420
You got googly-eyes
for golden boy George?

5
00:00:09,421 --> 00:00:10,980
I'm nearly 30 years old,

6
00:00:10,981 --> 00:00:13,015
and I have never been
in a real relationship.

7
00:00:13,016 --> 00:00:14,717
You did a pretty good job
of letting me in just now.

8
00:00:14,718 --> 00:00:16,286
<i>I found out that my dad</i>

9
00:00:16,287 --> 00:00:17,654
moved back to New York

10
00:00:17,655 --> 00:00:19,188
and kind of didn't tell me.

11
00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:20,855
The only thing
Ethan Hart cares about

12
00:00:20,856 --> 00:00:23,158
is the fact that we don't
share the same DNA.

13
00:00:23,159 --> 00:00:24,959
You are the most selfish
person I have ever met!

14
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,894
I'm done.
Don't say that.

15
00:00:25,895 --> 00:00:26,928
We're done, Dad.
(groaning)

16
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:28,197
Dad?

17
00:00:28,198 --> 00:00:29,164
Dad!

18
00:00:29,165 --> 00:00:30,299
I heard about your dad.

19
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,600
We got a good surgeon.

20
00:00:31,601 --> 00:00:32,401
Now you have a great one.

21
00:00:32,402 --> 00:00:33,468
I called my father.

22
00:00:33,469 --> 00:00:34,968
He'll be here tomorrow.

23
00:00:37,939 --> 00:00:39,773
(pinging)

24
00:00:41,577 --> 00:00:43,744
(pinging)

25
00:00:45,714 --> 00:00:46,681
(pinging continues)

26
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:57,390
Um, what are we looking at?

27
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:58,491
My father.

28
00:00:58,492 --> 00:01:00,393
In the form
of a blinking red dot.

29
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:01,494
See?

30
00:01:01,495 --> 00:01:03,763
He keeps getting... closer.

31
00:01:03,764 --> 00:01:05,164
Closer.

32
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:07,766
Closer, oh, God, he's closer.

33
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:10,202
Uh, how long have we been
starinatat the blinking red dot?

34
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:11,370
Since Delaware.

35
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:12,738
His flight lands
in under an hour,

36
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,740
and when it does,
I'm going to be waiting for him

37
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,808
at the hospital,
and I'm going to be doing this.

38
00:01:16,809 --> 00:01:18,544
Ooh.

39
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:20,078
And what's happening right now?

40
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:22,447
I'm giving you my cold face.

41
00:01:22,448 --> 00:01:24,014
Hard core, right?

42
00:01:24,015 --> 00:01:25,082
Uh, I don't know.

43
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:26,584
You just kind of look bored.

44
00:01:26,585 --> 00:01:27,818
(groans) No!

45
00:01:27,819 --> 00:01:29,820
I look like I don't care.

46
00:01:29,821 --> 00:01:32,323
You know, that's what I want
him to think, "Hey, Dad,

47
00:01:32,324 --> 00:01:34,359
"you don't care about me,
I don't care about you

48
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,926
just as much, whatevs."

49
00:01:35,927 --> 00:01:38,295
And then he'll do the surgery,
save George's father,

50
00:01:38,296 --> 00:01:40,564
and then it's on.

51
00:01:40,565 --> 00:01:41,831
What's on?

52
00:01:41,832 --> 00:01:44,334
I'm gonna unleash the whoop-ass.

53
00:01:44,335 --> 00:01:46,270
Oh, but I thought you just said
you didn't care?

54
00:01:46,271 --> 00:01:48,639
No, of course I care,
but I can't let him know that

55
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,206
right away or he might kill
Mr. Tucker.

56
00:01:50,207 --> 00:01:51,375
It's a very
stressful situation, Addy.

57
00:01:51,376 --> 00:01:53,477
Okay, maybe I should drive you.

58
00:01:53,478 --> 00:01:55,144
Yeah, I think
that would be best.

59
00:01:55,145 --> 00:01:56,679
(pinging)
Closer.

60
00:02:09,926 --> 00:02:11,426
Hey.

61
00:02:12,595 --> 00:02:14,462
Thought you'd be in Mobile.

62
00:02:16,365 --> 00:02:17,865
I'm headed back
to the hospital.

63
00:02:17,866 --> 00:02:22,304
I just came here to pick up
Mrs. Tucker some butter cookies.

64
00:02:22,305 --> 00:02:26,507
Did you get a chance to
talk to Georgebobout, uh...

65
00:02:26,508 --> 00:02:28,676
The man's father
just had a heart attack.

66
00:02:28,677 --> 00:02:31,478
For God's sake, Lavon.

67
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:33,314
Hardly tnknk iss
anpppproprtete time.

68
00:02:33,315 --> 00:02:35,248
We, , hey,'m, I'I'm rry.y.

69
00:02:35,249 --> 00:02:37,384
I stst want to be
prprarededthat's'slll.

70
00:02:37,385 --> 00:02:41,054
anklkl I don't know
when I I gonna tell hihinono

71
00:02:41,055 --> 00:02:43,923
ZoZos father is flying in
for the surgery,

72
00:02:43,924 --> 00:02:45,391
so George is already
beyond grateful.

73
00:02:45,392 --> 00:02:47,794
I'm not sure I'm following.

74
00:02:47,795 --> 00:02:49,495
The minute that I tell
George the truth,

75
00:02:49,496 --> 00:02:51,664
who do you think
he's gonna go running to?

76
00:02:51,665 --> 00:02:53,265
Zoe Hart, that's who.

77
00:02:53,266 --> 00:02:55,635
But if I don't tell him
soon, then she will, okay?

78
00:02:55,636 --> 00:02:57,303
So, I'm trapped.

79
00:02:57,304 --> 00:02:58,970
No, I still don't think
Zoe will say anything.

80
00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:00,071
She promised me.

81
00:03:00,072 --> 00:03:01,640
Can you just...

82
00:03:01,641 --> 00:03:03,107
give me some credit?

83
00:03:03,108 --> 00:03:05,076
This girl has been
trying to ruin my life

84
00:03:05,077 --> 00:03:06,545
since the minute
that she got here,

85
00:03:06,546 --> 00:03:09,648
and now she finally has
the chance, thanks to you, so...

86
00:03:09,649 --> 00:03:11,650
I hope you're happy.

87
00:03:19,691 --> 00:03:21,091
Hey.

88
00:03:21,092 --> 00:03:22,259
Cup of coffee.

89
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,661
Make it strong.

90
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:25,796
I need to stay mean
for the next few hours,

91
00:03:25,797 --> 00:03:27,398
and caffeine keeps me edgy.
Somehow,

92
00:03:27,399 --> 00:03:28,666
I don't think it's
in my best interests

93
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:29,600
to make you any meaner.

94
00:03:29,601 --> 00:03:31,300
Oh, don't worry.

95
00:03:31,301 --> 00:03:34,371
All of my anger today will be
focused on dear old dad.
Huh.

96
00:03:34,372 --> 00:03:36,339
And I thought it was only
your mom that you hated.

97
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,108
Well, I did, but then I realized
it wasn't fair of me

98
00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:41,077
to pour all of my bitterness

99
00:03:41,078 --> 00:03:42,645
and resentment

100
00:03:42,646 --> 00:03:44,113
into one parent, okay?

101
00:03:44,114 --> 00:03:46,948
So, my mom may have lied to me,
but my dad abandoned me.

102
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:49,251
Yeah, but wasn't that like
a million years ago?
Yes.

103
00:03:49,252 --> 00:03:50,819
But then he moved two weeks ago,

104
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,320
and he didn't even tell me.

105
00:03:52,321 --> 00:03:54,390
So, that was the straw
that broke the camel's back.

106
00:03:54,391 --> 00:03:55,491
Come on.

107
00:03:55,492 --> 00:03:57,393
Finally, I got
in touch with my anger.

108
00:03:57,394 --> 00:04:00,629
So, today, I'm gonna get all up
in his grill with it.

109
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,597
(snickers)
What?

110
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:02,230
You think I won't?

111
00:04:03,465 --> 00:04:05,433
That's real hot.

112
00:04:09,405 --> 00:04:10,471
See that?

113
00:04:10,472 --> 00:04:12,640
Made of steel, baby.

114
00:04:12,641 --> 00:04:13,974
Made of... (coughs)

115
00:04:17,045 --> 00:04:18,745
Hey, you gonna... you
gonna pay for that or...?

116
00:04:20,114 --> 00:04:21,515
Hey, Twig, how you doing?

117
00:04:21,516 --> 00:04:23,082
Mr. Maynard!

118
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,351
What an unexpected honor, sir.

119
00:04:25,352 --> 00:04:28,187
Welcome to your Jammer.
What can I get you?

120
00:04:28,188 --> 00:04:29,989
Well, it's good to
see somebody remembers

121
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:31,324
where the paychecks
are coming from.

122
00:04:31,325 --> 00:04:32,992
Good morning, patrons.

123
00:04:32,993 --> 00:04:34,794
Does anybody here know
what today is?

124
00:04:34,795 --> 00:04:35,795
Monday!

125
00:04:35,796 --> 00:04:36,395
No.

126
00:04:36,396 --> 00:04:37,463
Tuesday!

127
00:04:37,464 --> 00:04:39,164
Never mind.

128
00:04:39,165 --> 00:04:42,468
Today is the 30th anniversary
of the Rammer Jammer.

129
00:04:46,306 --> 00:04:47,205
And so,

130
00:04:47,206 --> 00:04:48,941
to honor her birthday,

131
00:04:48,942 --> 00:04:50,642
I'm gonna spruce
the old gal up a bit.

132
00:04:50,643 --> 00:04:52,143
Now, for starters,

133
00:04:52,144 --> 00:04:54,679
My lovely niece Wanda
is going to be joining

134
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,581
our staff as the new bar back.

135
00:04:56,582 --> 00:04:58,282
Whoo-hoo-hoo! Wanda!

136
00:05:00,853 --> 00:05:03,521
I'll also be bringing
in a pool table for the back.

137
00:05:03,522 --> 00:05:05,122
And I'm adding

138
00:05:05,123 --> 00:05:08,158
a new signature cocktail
to our menu.

139
00:05:08,159 --> 00:05:09,426
Uh...

140
00:05:09,427 --> 00:05:10,894
we don't have
any signature cocktails

141
00:05:10,895 --> 00:05:12,696
on the menu.

142
00:05:12,697 --> 00:05:14,698
<i>Which might be why we
never make Esquire's list</i>

143
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:16,900
of top 100 bars in America.

144
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:17,701
And to turn up the heat,

145
00:05:17,702 --> 00:05:19,970
we gonna make it a contest.

146
00:05:19,971 --> 00:05:20,971
Shelley vs. Wade.

147
00:05:21,873 --> 00:05:23,238
Whoever comes up

148
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,341
with the best signature cocktail
gets to name it.

149
00:05:25,342 --> 00:05:26,041
(gasps)

150
00:05:26,042 --> 00:05:26,909
Yay.
And...

151
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:27,977
gets 500 bucks.

152
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,112
(sighs)

153
00:05:30,113 --> 00:05:32,047
(applause)

154
00:05:32,048 --> 00:05:33,649
Oh, my God.

155
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,250
May the best person win.

156
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:37,086
I can help you if you want.

157
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,553
I'm real good at drinking.

158
00:05:40,222 --> 00:05:41,723
Come on, Wanda.
Oh.

159
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,628
(EKG monitor
beeping rhythmically)

160
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:48,363
(groaning softly)

161
00:05:52,234 --> 00:05:53,635
Dad, you okay?

162
00:05:53,636 --> 00:05:55,102
(coughing)
Can I get you a pillow?

163
00:05:55,103 --> 00:05:56,570
Another pillow? Do you want me
to call the nurse for you?

164
00:05:56,571 --> 00:05:57,938
Stop fussing, George, I'm fine.

165
00:05:57,939 --> 00:06:00,374
How about this?
Is that better?

166
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,447
You're a good son.

167
00:06:18,058 --> 00:06:19,893
Yeah, I'm...

168
00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:23,830
What's all that?

169
00:06:23,831 --> 00:06:26,399
Oh, um, it's just
a few things I brought

170
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,799
to make it a little homier.

171
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,702
I found some saltwater taffy
for you to enjoy

172
00:06:30,703 --> 00:06:31,837
after surgery.

173
00:06:31,838 --> 00:06:33,605
It's banana flavored.
(groans)

174
00:06:33,606 --> 00:06:36,207
I feel tired all of the sudden.

175
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:38,443
Maybe I ought to just
close my eyes, huh?

176
00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:40,812
Of course.

177
00:06:43,348 --> 00:06:45,683
(sighs)

178
00:06:45,684 --> 00:06:47,885
God, he looks pale,
doesn't he?

179
00:06:47,886 --> 00:06:48,920
Baby,

180
00:06:48,921 --> 00:06:50,655
he's sick,
but after the surgery,

181
00:06:50,656 --> 00:06:53,090
he's gonna be just fine.

182
00:06:53,091 --> 00:06:55,125
I still can't believe

183
00:06:55,126 --> 00:06:56,861
that Zoe made that phone call.

184
00:06:56,862 --> 00:06:59,863
I mean, I don't know how we're
ever gonna be able to repay her.

185
00:06:59,864 --> 00:07:02,999
Well, I mean, you know,
she called her father.

186
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,500
It's not like she
called the president.

187
00:07:04,501 --> 00:07:06,502
(wry chuckle)

188
00:07:08,539 --> 00:07:09,940
Lemon, you don't know
what you're talking about.

189
00:07:11,809 --> 00:07:14,944
Zoe calling her father is...
is just about the same

190
00:07:14,945 --> 00:07:16,579
as you calling your mother.

191
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,747
So, it is a huge deal.

192
00:07:18,748 --> 00:07:20,515
I'm sorry, I... I had
no idea, George.

193
00:07:20,516 --> 00:07:22,184
I know you didn't.

194
00:07:22,185 --> 00:07:24,152
You know what, Lemon?

195
00:07:24,153 --> 00:07:25,721
Just, from now on,

196
00:07:25,722 --> 00:07:28,457
just keep all
that nonsense to yourself

197
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:30,758
'cause I don't want
to hear it anymore.

198
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:33,294
George, I'm...
The truth
of the matter is,

199
00:07:33,295 --> 00:07:35,730
if you wouldn't have
made me get in that
stupid fight with my dad,

200
00:07:35,731 --> 00:07:37,599
he probably wouldn't be laying
in that bed right now.

201
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,935
So, if you want to be mad
at somebody, Lemon,

202
00:07:40,936 --> 00:07:42,971
you go ahead
and be mad at yourself.

203
00:07:50,244 --> 00:07:53,714
ADDY: All right, just remember,
keep it short and simple,

204
00:07:53,715 --> 00:07:55,148
and then after the surgery,

205
00:07:55,149 --> 00:07:56,783
That's when you hit him
with the big punches.

206
00:07:56,784 --> 00:07:58,218
Mm-hmm.

207
00:07:58,219 --> 00:08:00,087
That's him.

208
00:08:00,088 --> 00:08:03,155
♪ ♪

209
00:08:33,352 --> 00:08:35,418
Zoe.

210
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:36,520
It's good to see you.

211
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,960
Wasn't sure you'd be here.

212
00:08:42,961 --> 00:08:44,961
Well, I am.

213
00:08:44,962 --> 00:08:46,796
I'm glad you are.

214
00:08:46,797 --> 00:08:49,098
Dr. Hart?

215
00:08:49,099 --> 00:08:51,300
Good afternoon, I'm Dr. Brady,
chief of staff.

216
00:08:51,301 --> 00:08:53,369
It's an honor to meet you.
What's the cardiac output?

217
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:55,271
31%. Patient was
intubated last night.

218
00:08:55,272 --> 00:08:57,373
Prep for mitrovalve replacement.

219
00:08:57,374 --> 00:08:58,607
Coronary artery bypass

220
00:08:58,608 --> 00:09:00,276
and Teflon graft.

221
00:09:00,277 --> 00:09:02,678
This is Dr. Hart; she's going
to be assisting me in surgery

222
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:04,546
this afternoon.
I am?

223
00:09:05,948 --> 00:09:07,916
Yes, I am.

224
00:09:07,917 --> 00:09:09,918
Uh, we hadn't
anticipated...

225
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:11,920
That is Dr. Hart doesn't
currently have privileges

226
00:09:11,921 --> 00:09:13,155
at this hospital.

227
00:09:13,156 --> 00:09:15,691
So get her some.

228
00:09:17,926 --> 00:09:20,661
Uh, what happened
to your cold face?

229
00:09:20,662 --> 00:09:22,063
Don't worry, the plan
is still on track.

230
00:09:22,064 --> 00:09:23,564
After the surgery, big fight.

231
00:09:23,565 --> 00:09:24,531
Okay.

232
00:09:24,532 --> 00:09:26,433
Zoe, you coming?

233
00:09:26,434 --> 00:09:28,302
Yes, sir.

Kocher clamp.

236
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:49,319
(EKG monitor beeping)

237
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,354
Must be difficult for you.

238
00:09:51,355 --> 00:09:53,057
Seeing him this way.

239
00:09:53,058 --> 00:09:54,024
Seeing who this way?

240
00:09:55,894 --> 00:09:57,861
Oh, you mean Mr. Tucker?

241
00:09:57,862 --> 00:09:59,897
Is that what you call him?

242
00:09:59,898 --> 00:10:01,665
I don't call him anything;
I barely know the man.

243
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:04,001
You don't?

244
00:10:04,002 --> 00:10:05,101
But I thought...

245
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,172
Cautery.

246
00:10:11,474 --> 00:10:13,509
I was assuming

247
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:16,145
that the relationship between
you and his son was serious.

248
00:10:16,146 --> 00:10:17,513
George and me?

249
00:10:17,514 --> 00:10:19,381
We don't have a relationship.

250
00:10:19,382 --> 00:10:20,649
I mean,

251
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:22,884
we're friends,
but that's all.

252
00:10:22,885 --> 00:10:24,552
Oh.
Yeah.

253
00:10:24,553 --> 00:10:26,822
But...

254
00:10:26,823 --> 00:10:28,023
Take over suction.

255
00:10:44,239 --> 00:10:45,906
I need a drink.

256
00:10:47,008 --> 00:10:50,310
How about an artisanal cocktail

257
00:10:50,311 --> 00:10:53,980
to celebrate spring in Alabama?

258
00:10:55,649 --> 00:10:57,183
But I don't want
to celebrate spring.

259
00:10:57,184 --> 00:10:58,551
Try that.

260
00:11:03,057 --> 00:11:04,690
No! No! No!

261
00:11:04,691 --> 00:11:06,726
No, it's nasty!
What? Thought
it was good.

262
00:11:06,727 --> 00:11:08,327
Go ahead and try that.

263
00:11:08,328 --> 00:11:12,264
Oh, hell, no. No,
I did not make that.

264
00:11:12,265 --> 00:11:14,599
It's Shelley. She's putting
stuff in your drinks.

265
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,801
I saw her do it.

266
00:11:15,802 --> 00:11:18,670
Can't talk. Very busy.

267
00:11:18,671 --> 00:11:21,606
Oh, you are going down
like Chinatown.

268
00:11:23,743 --> 00:11:25,810
Not 'cause you're Asian.
'Cause it rhymes.

269
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:27,544
What is going on?

270
00:11:27,545 --> 00:11:29,881
Doing a contest. Best new
cocktail wins 500 bucks.

271
00:11:29,882 --> 00:11:32,083
Daddy needs a new amp.

272
00:11:32,084 --> 00:11:34,385
You can be my daddy.

273
00:11:34,386 --> 00:11:35,552
Thank you, Wanda.

274
00:11:35,553 --> 00:11:37,655
(growls)

275
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:39,023
(laughs)

276
00:11:41,092 --> 00:11:43,726
Did that girl just...
grrr at you?

277
00:11:43,727 --> 00:11:44,995
It happens.

278
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:46,229
Point is, she's right, okay?

279
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:48,198
I should be doing this
in my own home,

280
00:11:48,199 --> 00:11:49,399
but the amount of booze

281
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,533
it would take...

282
00:11:50,534 --> 00:11:51,968
Let's do it. I'll buy.

283
00:11:51,969 --> 00:11:53,336
Seriously?
Why not?

284
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:55,238
This is exactly the kind
of mindless fun

285
00:11:55,239 --> 00:11:57,306
Lavon Hayes needs right now.

286
00:11:57,307 --> 00:11:59,308
Let's make some cocktails, baby!

287
00:11:59,309 --> 00:12:00,642
My man!
Yeah.

288
00:12:00,643 --> 00:12:02,678
(rhythmic beeping and whooshing)

289
00:12:05,148 --> 00:12:07,149
Dr. Hart, what is
your recommendation

290
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:09,484
if our pathology was
a pseudo aneurysm?

291
00:12:09,485 --> 00:12:13,087
Um, surgical repair similar
to ventricular rupture.

292
00:12:13,088 --> 00:12:13,855
Your recommendation?

293
00:12:13,856 --> 00:12:15,356
Coronary artery bypass

294
00:12:15,357 --> 00:12:17,959
and, uh, Teflon graft
repair of the ruptured zone.

295
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,860
Very good.

296
00:12:18,861 --> 00:12:21,062
Dr. Hart will now perform

297
00:12:21,063 --> 00:12:23,764
a resection
of the damaged ventricle

298
00:12:23,765 --> 00:12:25,900
and closure defect.

299
00:12:25,901 --> 00:12:28,469
You know, it's been a while
since I've done one of those.

300
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,602
Think you can handle it?

301
00:12:31,339 --> 00:12:32,639
Absolutely.

302
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,107
I agree.

303
00:12:39,647 --> 00:12:40,180
Retractor.

304
00:12:41,983 --> 00:12:43,183
Suction.

305
00:12:50,357 --> 00:12:51,590
All good.

306
00:12:51,591 --> 00:12:52,925
Okay.
Oh.

307
00:12:52,926 --> 00:12:54,360
Surgery was a success.
He's gonna need to be

308
00:12:54,361 --> 00:12:56,462
on blood thinners
from now on, but all...

309
00:12:56,463 --> 00:12:57,830
But he's going to be okay?

310
00:12:57,831 --> 00:12:59,131
He's going to be okay.

311
00:12:59,132 --> 00:13:00,766
Oh, Dr. Hart,
thank you so much.

312
00:13:00,767 --> 00:13:02,200
Thank you.
No worries.

313
00:13:02,201 --> 00:13:04,102
Dr. Hart, I don't know what
to say. All I can say is...

314
00:13:04,103 --> 00:13:05,203
All I can say is...
You are an

315
00:13:05,204 --> 00:13:06,738
angel sent from heaven.

316
00:13:06,739 --> 00:13:08,306
One little package.

317
00:13:08,307 --> 00:13:09,607
Oh, I didn't do anything.

318
00:13:09,608 --> 00:13:11,042
Yes, you did.
Yes, you did.

319
00:13:11,043 --> 00:13:12,744
You did everything.
Thank you so much.

320
00:13:12,745 --> 00:13:14,645
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.

321
00:13:14,646 --> 00:13:16,381
Thank you.

322
00:13:16,382 --> 00:13:17,614
And you're welcome.

323
00:13:17,615 --> 00:13:20,417
You're welcome. Sure...

324
00:13:20,418 --> 00:13:23,254
Um, now, there are going
to be some restrictions

325
00:13:23,255 --> 00:13:24,922
on Mr. Tucker
for the next few weeks.

326
00:13:24,923 --> 00:13:26,156
Yeah?
He should avoid
climbing stairs.

327
00:13:26,157 --> 00:13:27,424
Okay, no stairs.

328
00:13:27,425 --> 00:13:29,493
No lifting objects
more than ten pounds.

329
00:13:29,494 --> 00:13:30,594
All right.
Okay.

330
00:13:30,595 --> 00:13:31,795
We probably hide the Scotch.

331
00:13:31,796 --> 00:13:33,029
I don't know if
we can do that.

332
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:33,963
Discourage the Scotch.
Okay.
Okay.

333
00:13:33,964 --> 00:13:35,298
Ah, but he did
very well...

334
00:13:35,299 --> 00:13:37,400
Crickett, meet me at
my house in an hour.

335
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:39,468
It's an emergency.

336
00:13:39,469 --> 00:13:42,005
That was impressive work
you did in there, Zoe.

337
00:13:42,006 --> 00:13:44,840
Thank you. Thanks.

338
00:13:44,841 --> 00:13:47,676
No. Actually, I wanted
to talk to you...
I'm glad
you called. It's...

339
00:13:47,677 --> 00:13:49,111
Uh... (laughs)
You go first.

340
00:13:49,112 --> 00:13:51,246
Okay. Um...

341
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:56,084
I've been meaning to call
you for some time now, um,

342
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,653
but my-my schedule has
just been so hectic and...

343
00:13:58,654 --> 00:14:00,555
Yeah, sure.

344
00:14:00,556 --> 00:14:02,824
Frankly, um...

345
00:14:02,825 --> 00:14:06,260
it felt like a conversation
that had to be in person.

346
00:14:06,261 --> 00:14:08,562
Oh.

347
00:14:08,563 --> 00:14:11,665
The secret that your
mother asked me to keep

348
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:14,135
has been a strain
on our relationship

349
00:14:14,136 --> 00:14:15,436
for far too long.

350
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,138
I know. I completely agree.
Just because

351
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:18,739
I'm not your
father doesn't mean

352
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:21,441
that we can't have another
kind of relationship.

353
00:14:21,442 --> 00:14:25,011
Um, how do you mean?

354
00:14:25,012 --> 00:14:27,180
Well, for instance,
we're both surgeons.

355
00:14:27,181 --> 00:14:29,983
Technically, that
makes us colleagues.

356
00:14:29,984 --> 00:14:31,318
That's an excellent
foundation.

357
00:14:31,319 --> 00:14:33,253
Wouldn't you agree?

358
00:14:33,254 --> 00:14:35,021
I guess. You know, I just...

359
00:14:35,022 --> 00:14:36,856
I've never really
thought of it that way.

360
00:14:36,857 --> 00:14:38,491
Of course you haven't,

361
00:14:38,492 --> 00:14:41,226
'cause we've been so mired down
in what we can't be

362
00:14:41,227 --> 00:14:43,763
that we haven't fully explored
the alternatives.

363
00:14:43,764 --> 00:14:46,632
You mean, like, friends?

364
00:14:46,633 --> 00:14:48,067
Why not?

365
00:14:48,068 --> 00:14:49,869
In fact, there's
no pressing reason

366
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,604
that I have to return

367
00:14:51,605 --> 00:14:53,072
to New York right away.

368
00:14:53,073 --> 00:14:55,139
How would you like
to have dinner tomorrow night?

369
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,308
In BlueBell?

370
00:14:57,309 --> 00:14:58,777
Sure.

371
00:14:58,778 --> 00:15:00,345
We can talk about the surgery,

372
00:15:00,346 --> 00:15:02,113
discuss your career,
whatever you like.

373
00:15:03,382 --> 00:15:05,116
Yeah, that sounds great.

374
00:15:05,117 --> 00:15:07,986
Um, uh....

375
00:15:07,987 --> 00:15:10,053
Call me Ethan.

376
00:15:11,222 --> 00:15:13,390
Ethan.

377
00:15:16,227 --> 00:15:18,929
Sounds great.

378
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:21,164
Is it Mr. Tucker?
Is he dead?

379
00:15:21,165 --> 00:15:22,900
Do we have
to postpone the wedding?

380
00:15:22,901 --> 00:15:24,768
No.

381
00:15:24,769 --> 00:15:26,669
Mr. Tucker is just fine,
thank goodness.

382
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:27,704
The surgery
was a success.

383
00:15:27,705 --> 00:15:29,271
Thank goodness!

384
00:15:29,272 --> 00:15:31,774
Unfortunately, we
do not have time

385
00:15:31,775 --> 00:15:34,176
to celebrate this wonderful
news as, once again,

386
00:15:34,177 --> 00:15:36,112
Zoe Hart is hell-bent
on destroying me.

387
00:15:36,113 --> 00:15:37,580
What's she done now?

388
00:15:37,581 --> 00:15:39,148
It's not about
what she's done.

389
00:15:39,149 --> 00:15:40,550
<i>It's what she's
about to do.</i>

390
00:15:40,551 --> 00:15:42,417
What is she about to do?

391
00:15:45,121 --> 00:15:47,222
Never mind.

392
00:15:47,223 --> 00:15:50,392
Now that she and George
are getting so close,

393
00:15:50,393 --> 00:15:53,161
she will have the
opportunity to do it,

394
00:15:53,162 --> 00:15:55,296
which is why

395
00:15:55,297 --> 00:15:59,767
we have to bring down
Zoe Hart once and for all.

396
00:16:08,626 --> 00:16:09,994
(sighs)
(door opens)

397
00:16:13,664 --> 00:16:15,165
So? Tell me everything.

398
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:17,667
Uh, Mr. Tucker's
surgery was a success.

399
00:16:17,668 --> 00:16:19,235
Well, I know that. I'm talking
about the big blowout.

400
00:16:19,236 --> 00:16:22,271
I mean, did you cry?
Did he cry? What did you say?

401
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:24,908
What did he say?
You know, actually, it
wasn't that big a deal.

402
00:16:24,909 --> 00:16:28,343
Really? 'Cause it seemed like
an awfully big deal yesterday.

403
00:16:28,344 --> 00:16:31,780
You know, it's possible
that I may have overreacted.

404
00:16:31,781 --> 00:16:34,416
Ethan and I are going
to be friends.

405
00:16:34,417 --> 00:16:36,518
Oh, that's lovely.
Who's Ethan?

406
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:37,385
My father.

407
00:16:37,386 --> 00:16:38,921
I see.

408
00:16:38,922 --> 00:16:40,956
Well, actually,
it-it kind of makes sense,

409
00:16:40,957 --> 00:16:43,692
you know, because technically,
he's not my real father.

410
00:16:43,693 --> 00:16:45,093
So it was unfair
of me to yell at him

411
00:16:45,094 --> 00:16:47,528
as if he were my father
since he's not.

412
00:16:47,529 --> 00:16:48,896
'Cause he's Ethan.

413
00:16:48,897 --> 00:16:51,199
Right. My friend
and colleague.

414
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,900
See, it's all very civilized.

415
00:16:55,003 --> 00:16:56,904
Uh, this may be none
of my business,

416
00:16:56,905 --> 00:16:58,305
but that's a
load of crap.

417
00:16:58,306 --> 00:17:00,506
No judgment, obviously.

418
00:17:00,507 --> 00:17:01,975
Zoe, I got two kids.

419
00:17:01,976 --> 00:17:04,444
One of 'em, I gave birth
to, and the other I adopted.

420
00:17:04,445 --> 00:17:05,678
And guess what?

421
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,413
They're both my kids.

422
00:17:07,414 --> 00:17:10,516
Being a parent is about a hell
of a lot more than biology.

423
00:17:10,517 --> 00:17:11,985
That man is your father.

424
00:17:11,986 --> 00:17:14,654
Doesn't matter about
what some blood test says.

425
00:17:14,655 --> 00:17:17,356
Look, he's offering me
something here, Addy.

426
00:17:17,357 --> 00:17:19,892
A chance for us to have
something instead of nothing.

427
00:17:19,893 --> 00:17:21,360
I'm gonna take it.

428
00:17:21,361 --> 00:17:23,996
And it would be great
if you could be happy for me.

429
00:17:23,997 --> 00:17:26,598
Well, if you're happy,
I'm happy.

430
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:29,201
I just hope
you don't wake up one day

431
00:17:29,202 --> 00:17:31,637
and find you've still got
all this anger inside you.

432
00:17:31,638 --> 00:17:33,104
I keep a lot inside.

433
00:17:33,105 --> 00:17:36,007
How else would I live
inin BlueBell?

434
00:17:39,378 --> 00:17:40,812
<i>CRICKETT:
Number 37:</i>

435
00:17:40,813 --> 00:17:42,613
Water boarding.

436
00:17:42,614 --> 00:17:44,515
Many politicians are still
debating the ethics

437
00:17:44,516 --> 00:17:46,517
of this particular form
of torture, but...

438
00:17:46,518 --> 00:17:48,118
Uh, next.

439
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:50,353
Right.

440
00:17:50,354 --> 00:17:52,455
Number 38:
The Jenna.

441
00:17:52,456 --> 00:17:54,457
Ooh, I used this one
on Jenna Richman

442
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:55,926
in our last pageant together.

443
00:17:55,927 --> 00:17:58,262
It does require pepper spray
and a sanitary napkin...

444
00:17:58,263 --> 00:18:01,832
Okay, enough. Enough,
enough, enough, enough.

445
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,733
While I appreciate
the quantity

446
00:18:03,734 --> 00:18:05,935
of ideas that you have
come up with, dear,

447
00:18:05,936 --> 00:18:07,804
if we attempted
half of them,

448
00:18:07,805 --> 00:18:09,272
Zoe Hart would
laugh in our faces.

449
00:18:09,273 --> 00:18:11,440
And the other half--
though they would be fun--

450
00:18:11,441 --> 00:18:12,574
would get us arrested.

451
00:18:12,575 --> 00:18:14,443
But A for effort, dear.

452
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:18,514
Oh, my God.

453
00:18:19,882 --> 00:18:21,783
The answer's so obvious
I can't believe

454
00:18:21,784 --> 00:18:23,418
I didn't think about it earlier.

455
00:18:23,419 --> 00:18:26,021
Well, what is it?

456
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:29,357
I... am gonna make...

457
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:32,327
Zoe Hart... my best friend.

458
00:18:32,328 --> 00:18:35,063
But that is the opposite
of what you asked me to do.

459
00:18:35,064 --> 00:18:36,797
I would have made
a totally different list.

460
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:38,098
Oh, Crickett,

461
00:18:38,099 --> 00:18:40,600
you know that saying--
keep your friends close,

462
00:18:40,601 --> 00:18:43,503
and your enemies closer?

463
00:18:43,504 --> 00:18:45,372
Well, that's
what I'm going to do.

464
00:18:46,741 --> 00:18:48,375
<i>George, I came here to tell you</i>

465
00:18:48,376 --> 00:18:49,643
that you were right.

466
00:18:49,644 --> 00:18:51,778
I've been acting like

467
00:18:51,779 --> 00:18:54,480
a petulant little girl
when it comes to Zoe Hart.

468
00:18:54,481 --> 00:18:56,515
I know that

469
00:18:56,516 --> 00:18:58,218
nothing is going on
between you two,

470
00:18:58,219 --> 00:19:01,654
and it is just silly of me
to act so terrible to her

471
00:19:01,655 --> 00:19:04,858
when she has been so good
to our family.

472
00:19:08,694 --> 00:19:10,795
Do you really mean that?

473
00:19:10,796 --> 00:19:12,530
I do.

474
00:19:12,531 --> 00:19:15,267
And... I want
to make things right,

475
00:19:15,268 --> 00:19:19,604
so I was thinking that maybe
I could host a dinner,

476
00:19:19,605 --> 00:19:21,506
um, for Zoe
and for her father.

477
00:19:21,507 --> 00:19:24,475
But I mean,
if I asked Zoe,

478
00:19:24,476 --> 00:19:26,978
there's no way
that she would come.

479
00:19:26,979 --> 00:19:29,380
But you know,
if-if maybe you did,

480
00:19:29,381 --> 00:19:31,349
then...

481
00:19:33,518 --> 00:19:35,319
I mean, I could do that,

482
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,155
but Lemon, if this is just
another one of your games,

483
00:19:38,156 --> 00:19:39,323
then I don't...
It's not.

484
00:19:41,426 --> 00:19:43,527
Okay.

485
00:19:43,528 --> 00:19:45,496
Okay. I'll, uh...

486
00:19:45,497 --> 00:19:47,598
I'll go over there later
and ask her,

487
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:49,332
and I'll tell you
what she says.

488
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:51,368
Really?

489
00:19:51,369 --> 00:19:53,169
Oh. Okay, great.

490
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:55,406
Well, um, I'll start working
on the menu, then.

491
00:19:55,407 --> 00:19:57,740
(laughs)

492
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:00,510
(knocking)
(clearing throat)

493
00:20:01,545 --> 00:20:04,013
Am I early?

494
00:20:04,014 --> 00:20:05,180
No.

495
00:20:05,181 --> 00:20:06,849
Come in. Sit down.

496
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:08,317
Make yourself
comfortable.

497
00:20:08,318 --> 00:20:10,920
(clears throat)

498
00:20:10,921 --> 00:20:14,055
I figured that we could have
a quick tour of Bluebell,

499
00:20:14,056 --> 00:20:16,591
and then, you know, maybe
ndnd somewhere and have dinner.

500
00:20:16,592 --> 00:20:17,893
Although I
should warn you.

501
00:20:17,894 --> 00:20:19,761
There are only two
places to eat,

502
00:20:19,762 --> 00:20:23,498
and one restaurant is a bar,
so really only one restaurant.

503
00:20:23,499 --> 00:20:25,333
I'll let you decide.

504
00:20:25,334 --> 00:20:27,669
Um, Fancie's it is.

505
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:29,537
I, uh, like your place,
by the way.

506
00:20:29,538 --> 00:20:31,539
It's very homey.
Oh, thank... Oh!

507
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,140
Whoa! (laughs)

508
00:20:33,141 --> 00:20:34,575
Sorry.

509
00:20:34,576 --> 00:20:36,143
It's a little messy.

510
00:20:36,144 --> 00:20:37,711
I was just trying
to clean it up.
What's this?

511
00:20:37,712 --> 00:20:38,546
What?

512
00:20:40,348 --> 00:20:42,817
Oh.

513
00:20:42,818 --> 00:20:44,651
I'm sorry. I didn't know
that was out here.

514
00:20:44,652 --> 00:20:46,986
You're changing your name?

515
00:20:46,987 --> 00:20:49,055
What's wrong with Zoe?

516
00:20:49,056 --> 00:20:51,357
Not my first name.

517
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:58,264
Hey, as long as you keep
"doctor" in there somewhere.

518
00:20:58,265 --> 00:21:01,266
Guarantees you a table
anywhere in New York.

519
00:21:01,267 --> 00:21:04,235
Right. I'll remember that.

520
00:21:06,172 --> 00:21:10,108
So, uh, what's up first
on the BlueBell tour?

521
00:21:10,109 --> 00:21:11,343
Are we heading over
to your practice?

522
00:21:11,344 --> 00:21:14,012
Actually, you know what?

523
00:21:14,013 --> 00:21:17,081
All of a sudden,
I'm not feeling all that well.

524
00:21:17,082 --> 00:21:18,449
Oh, no. Really?

525
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:19,750
Yeah.

526
00:21:21,252 --> 00:21:23,487
Hey.

527
00:21:23,488 --> 00:21:25,088
Hey.
Hi.

528
00:21:25,089 --> 00:21:27,891
Um, I catch y'all
at a bad time?

529
00:21:27,892 --> 00:21:29,058
No, no. What's up?

530
00:21:29,059 --> 00:21:30,560
Um, well,

531
00:21:30,561 --> 00:21:32,195
I know it is extremely
short notice,

532
00:21:32,196 --> 00:21:34,464
but I was hoping to
convince you and Dr. Hart

533
00:21:34,465 --> 00:21:37,901
to join us at the Breeland
estate this evening for a dinner

534
00:21:37,902 --> 00:21:39,035
in your honor.

535
00:21:39,036 --> 00:21:41,269
What?
Well, just

536
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:43,772
to thank you for everyining
y'all did for my dad.

537
00:21:43,773 --> 00:21:45,508
That's very
generous of you,

538
00:21:45,509 --> 00:21:47,142
but unfortunately,
Zoe is not feeling

539
00:21:47,143 --> 00:21:48,544
all that well.

540
00:21:48,545 --> 00:21:50,679
Oh, it's not that big of a deal.
Just a little headache.

541
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,214
Oh, okay, well,
dinner's not gonna be

542
00:21:52,215 --> 00:21:54,082
for a little while, so maybe if
you're feeling better by then...

543
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:56,450
I mean, I don't
want to push you.

544
00:21:56,451 --> 00:21:59,587
Um, why don't I let you rest
and we can skip the tour

545
00:21:59,588 --> 00:22:01,789
and then we can all
have dinner together?

546
00:22:03,358 --> 00:22:04,959
In a big group, right?

547
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,060
Sounds good.

548
00:22:06,061 --> 00:22:07,428
The more the merrier.

549
00:22:07,429 --> 00:22:08,830
Fantastic.
All right,

550
00:22:08,831 --> 00:22:10,398
I'll let Lemon know,
and then, uh,

551
00:22:10,399 --> 00:22:11,899
does 7:30 work for y'all?

552
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:12,900
Yeah, it works for me.
Me, too.

553
00:22:12,901 --> 00:22:14,001
Great.

554
00:22:14,002 --> 00:22:15,268
Well, then
I'll see you later.

555
00:22:15,269 --> 00:22:16,102
'Kay.

556
00:22:16,103 --> 00:22:17,905
Okay.

557
00:22:32,312 --> 00:22:34,412
Are you sure
this is food?

558
00:22:34,413 --> 00:22:37,682
Because I have never seen
these words in any cook books I know.

559
00:22:39,819 --> 00:22:43,121
It's the food of Zoe's people.

560
00:22:43,122 --> 00:22:46,357
The idea is to make her
feel comfortable as fast as possible.

561
00:22:46,358 --> 00:22:49,560
And you're sure all this starch
is gonna make Zoe like you?

562
00:22:49,561 --> 00:22:52,229
Well, I mean, obviously,
we're not gonna become
best friends right away,

563
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:55,365
but the idea tonight is
just lay the foundation,

564
00:22:55,366 --> 00:22:58,168
compliment her clothing,
feign interest in her career,

565
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:01,038
and then stick up for her when
Daddy says something horrible.

566
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,606
And then hopefully,
in a week or two

567
00:23:02,607 --> 00:23:04,541
I should be able to
invite her to our wedding.

568
00:23:04,542 --> 00:23:06,843
You want her at your wedding?!

569
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:09,445
Well, of course I don't
want her at my wedding.

570
00:23:09,446 --> 00:23:11,580
It's just the only
thing I could think of

571
00:23:11,581 --> 00:23:14,083
to keep her away from George.

572
00:23:14,084 --> 00:23:17,053
I mean, a girl can't
break up a wedding

573
00:23:17,054 --> 00:23:19,122
that she's invited to attend.

574
00:23:19,123 --> 00:23:20,456
Can she?

575
00:23:20,457 --> 00:23:22,590
You're a genius.

576
00:23:22,591 --> 00:23:23,959
(laughs)

577
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,360
♪ ♪

578
00:23:33,936 --> 00:23:36,337
I-I want to bathe in this.

579
00:23:36,338 --> 00:23:37,805
(laughs)

580
00:23:37,806 --> 00:23:39,706
Ah, she's a beaut,
ain't she?

581
00:23:39,707 --> 00:23:41,942
Can you taste
the lavender in there?

582
00:23:41,943 --> 00:23:45,479
It's real subtle, but
I think it balances
out the flavor nicely.

583
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,048
Wade, my friend,
you have a gift.

584
00:23:48,049 --> 00:23:50,017
No, man, you know,
it's just booze.

585
00:23:50,018 --> 00:23:52,386
Don't take much to
make it taste good.

586
00:23:52,387 --> 00:23:54,254
No, I disagree;
this takes talent.

587
00:23:54,255 --> 00:23:56,389
And you have clearly got it.

588
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:58,958
Just stupid fun,
man, that's all.

589
00:24:01,628 --> 00:24:03,362
Look, here's the thing.

590
00:24:03,363 --> 00:24:07,466
When I was a kid, I used to love
throwing the football around

591
00:24:07,467 --> 00:24:09,335
in the backyard
with my brothers.

592
00:24:09,336 --> 00:24:12,437
And at the time, you know,
I thought I was just goofing off

593
00:24:12,438 --> 00:24:13,738
and having fun.

594
00:24:13,739 --> 00:24:15,573
I had no idea
all that fun

595
00:24:15,574 --> 00:24:17,910
was gonna turn into
a career in the NFL.

596
00:24:17,911 --> 00:24:21,146
Point is, you never know
where all this could lead, man.

597
00:24:23,449 --> 00:24:27,084
Uh, y-you know, uh...
I'm just bartending

598
00:24:27,085 --> 00:24:30,354
while I figure out what I'm
doing with the rest of my life.

599
00:24:30,355 --> 00:24:31,789
Yeah.

600
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,891
But, uh, hey...

601
00:24:33,892 --> 00:24:36,393
try this on for size.

602
00:24:36,394 --> 00:24:38,696
All right, what
we got here...

603
00:24:38,697 --> 00:24:41,932
is something extra special,
fresh off the presses.

604
00:24:43,868 --> 00:24:45,702
<i>WADE: Ba-blam.</i>

605
00:24:47,638 --> 00:24:48,972
Oh, there you are, Daddy.

606
00:24:48,973 --> 00:24:51,107
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

607
00:24:51,108 --> 00:24:54,077
Oh, sweetheart, I just
came home from a very
long day at work.

608
00:24:54,078 --> 00:24:57,380
I just want to sit down and
enjoy this scotch before
the vultures descend.

609
00:24:57,381 --> 00:24:59,081
Of course.

610
00:24:59,082 --> 00:25:01,851
I just need your help with
one itty-bitty little thing.

611
00:25:03,286 --> 00:25:04,686
You were there the other night

612
00:25:04,687 --> 00:25:06,688
when Zoe Hart all but proclaimed

613
00:25:06,689 --> 00:25:08,924
her undying love for my George.

614
00:25:08,925 --> 00:25:10,893
Yes, I was fortunate enough
to have witnessed

615
00:25:10,894 --> 00:25:12,594
that deeply
uncomfortable moment.

616
00:25:12,595 --> 00:25:14,662
But, sugar, you
don't have to worry

617
00:25:14,663 --> 00:25:16,630
about a thing.
Maybe not, but...

618
00:25:16,631 --> 00:25:18,432
our relationship is
in a vulnerable state,

619
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:21,936
and I know for a fact
that Zoe Hart is trying
to destroy it.

620
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:25,974
Well, then why are we
having her over for dinner?

621
00:25:25,975 --> 00:25:27,575
Oh, no.

622
00:25:27,576 --> 00:25:30,143
No. No, no, no.
Oh, it is gonna be

623
00:25:30,144 --> 00:25:31,745
a lovely dinner, but...

624
00:25:31,746 --> 00:25:36,283
I just need you to get upset
when I mention the fact

625
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:40,254
that your patient Maggie
Thornhill is thinking about
leaving you for Zoe Hart.

626
00:25:40,255 --> 00:25:42,189
What? Well, since when?

627
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:43,656
No, no, no, she's
not, she's not.
Maggie...?

628
00:25:43,657 --> 00:25:45,259
I'm just gonna say
she is,
When did this happen?

629
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,792
and you need
to get upset about it.

630
00:25:46,793 --> 00:25:48,794
Well, I am upset.
Why would she do that?

631
00:25:48,795 --> 00:25:52,164
I've been her doctor
for, what, 20,
25 years...
(frustrated grunt)

632
00:25:52,165 --> 00:25:53,499
Okay, just follow my lead,

633
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,534
and we'll be fine.

634
00:25:55,535 --> 00:25:56,468
(doorbell rings)

635
00:25:56,469 --> 00:25:58,104
Oh! They're here!

636
00:25:58,105 --> 00:25:59,939
(exhales quietly)

637
00:26:06,913 --> 00:26:09,047
That is such
a beautiful purse.

638
00:26:09,048 --> 00:26:11,616
Let me take that for you;
I'll put it away.

639
00:26:11,617 --> 00:26:13,184
Thanks.
Mm-hmm.

640
00:26:14,653 --> 00:26:17,655
Uh, we're having
latkes for dinner?

641
00:26:17,656 --> 00:26:20,224
Oh, yes. This is
just the amuse-bouche.

642
00:26:20,225 --> 00:26:23,860
I thought that your father
would appreciate a kosher meal.

643
00:26:23,861 --> 00:26:25,595
Oh, he's not Jewish;
my mother is.

644
00:26:25,596 --> 00:26:26,931
Really?

645
00:26:26,932 --> 00:26:28,065
Well, that is fascinating.

646
00:26:28,066 --> 00:26:29,333
There is just so much

647
00:26:29,334 --> 00:26:30,867
I don't know
about you, Zoe Hart.

648
00:26:30,868 --> 00:26:33,103
How about we sit
next to each other at dinner,

649
00:26:33,104 --> 00:26:35,371
and you can tell me more
about your ethnic origins.

650
00:26:35,372 --> 00:26:38,874
(pager beeping)
Why don't we all get started
on the first course.

651
00:26:38,875 --> 00:26:41,010
Oh, um, Daddy,
before I forget.

652
00:26:41,011 --> 00:26:42,845
I saw your patient
Maggie Thornhill

653
00:26:42,846 --> 00:26:43,846
this morning...
Oh, no.

654
00:26:43,847 --> 00:26:45,581
ZOE:
What is it?

655
00:26:45,582 --> 00:26:47,951
Well, uh, y'all are
gonna have to excuse me.

656
00:26:47,952 --> 00:26:50,119
Anna Carver's water just broke;
she's having twins.

657
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,353
(chuckles)

658
00:26:51,354 --> 00:26:52,888
Look at that!
But, Daddy? Daddy?

659
00:26:52,889 --> 00:26:54,623
Do you need help?
I've been delivering babies

660
00:26:54,624 --> 00:26:55,658
my whole life--
haven't needed help yet.

661
00:26:55,659 --> 00:26:57,693
(laughter)
Ethan, uh,

662
00:26:57,694 --> 00:27:00,362
thank you, pleasure.
And, everybody, just
enjoy your dinner.

663
00:27:00,363 --> 00:27:01,497
Excuse me.
You bet.

664
00:27:01,498 --> 00:27:03,298
Good luck, Brick.
Good night.

665
00:27:03,299 --> 00:27:05,534
(George chuckles)

666
00:27:05,535 --> 00:27:06,768
GEORGE: Anyway,
um, I just...

667
00:27:06,769 --> 00:27:08,736
just wanted
to say thank you.

668
00:27:08,737 --> 00:27:11,573
It was so great of you
to come all the way down here

669
00:27:11,574 --> 00:27:12,874
just for my
family. I...

670
00:27:12,875 --> 00:27:14,976
You know, I hear from
people all the time

671
00:27:14,977 --> 00:27:17,378
that surgeons are cold
and selfish people,

672
00:27:17,379 --> 00:27:20,548
and I have to tell you,
from my experience,

673
00:27:20,549 --> 00:27:22,583
it couldn't be
further from the truth.

674
00:27:22,584 --> 00:27:24,284
How many surgeons
do you know?

675
00:27:24,285 --> 00:27:26,186
Well, uh...

676
00:27:26,187 --> 00:27:27,688
(laughs):
two, I guess.

677
00:27:27,689 --> 00:27:29,490
You and Zoe.
And how well

678
00:27:29,491 --> 00:27:31,224
<i>do you know Zoe?</i>

679
00:27:31,225 --> 00:27:32,659
Uh...

680
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,828
I'm not so sure what you mean.

681
00:27:34,829 --> 00:27:36,930
I mean, your relationship
must be fairly significant

682
00:27:36,931 --> 00:27:39,031
for her to have called me here.

683
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:40,800
Zoe doesn't ask for
favors very often.

684
00:27:40,801 --> 00:27:44,804
Oh, I mean, you know, it was
very generous of... of her

685
00:27:44,805 --> 00:27:46,171
as well.
It's...

686
00:27:46,172 --> 00:27:48,841
Would've made sense if
you two were an item.

687
00:27:48,842 --> 00:27:50,743
(laughs)

688
00:27:50,744 --> 00:27:53,813
Uh, yeah, you know, I could see
how you might think that,

689
00:27:53,814 --> 00:27:55,246
but no, I'm...

690
00:27:55,247 --> 00:27:57,148
I'm with Lemon, so...
The blond one.

691
00:27:57,149 --> 00:27:58,550
Yeah, I got that.

692
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:02,521
My point is, Zoe must care
for you a great deal.

693
00:28:04,156 --> 00:28:06,958
(laughs) No, we are...
we're, we're just good friends.

694
00:28:06,959 --> 00:28:08,960
That's all.

695
00:28:08,961 --> 00:28:10,128
Good.

696
00:28:10,129 --> 00:28:12,129
(phone vibrates)

697
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:14,264
Sorry.
Uh...

698
00:28:14,265 --> 00:28:16,834
I freshen you up there, or...?
Excuse me,
I have to take this.

699
00:28:16,835 --> 00:28:18,602
Oh, yeah. Of course.

700
00:28:18,603 --> 00:28:20,203
(laughs)

701
00:28:29,446 --> 00:28:31,347
Oh, there you are.

702
00:28:31,348 --> 00:28:33,382
It's a pretty
painting, isn't it?

703
00:28:33,383 --> 00:28:35,951
Used to be in Daddy's study,
but I thought that it deserved

704
00:28:35,952 --> 00:28:38,354
to be on more of a
prominent display.

705
00:28:38,355 --> 00:28:39,522
Yeah, it's nice.

706
00:28:39,523 --> 00:28:41,723
My goodness, Zoe Hart,
there is just...

707
00:28:41,724 --> 00:28:43,792
so much that I
don't know about you.

708
00:28:43,793 --> 00:28:45,594
You are just
a connoisseur of art.

709
00:28:45,595 --> 00:28:47,563
(gasps)
Oh, my goodness,

710
00:28:47,564 --> 00:28:49,065
where are my manners?

711
00:28:49,066 --> 00:28:51,632
I still have not yet offered
you a tour of our estate.

712
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:55,470
Is everything all right?
A patient

713
00:28:55,471 --> 00:28:57,138
of mine in New York;
I had to take it.

714
00:28:57,139 --> 00:29:00,175
Oh, you doctors--
never a moment of peace.

715
00:29:00,176 --> 00:29:02,377
Okay, now that you're back,
we can officially start dinner.

716
00:29:02,378 --> 00:29:03,744
Actually, I need

717
00:29:03,745 --> 00:29:06,680
to speak to Zoe for
a moment in private.

718
00:29:06,681 --> 00:29:07,747
Of course.

719
00:29:16,958 --> 00:29:18,559
(door closes)

720
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,627
I think we should go,

721
00:29:20,628 --> 00:29:22,528
don't you?
We can't leave yet.

722
00:29:22,529 --> 00:29:24,097
Dinner hasn't even started.

723
00:29:24,098 --> 00:29:25,631
Is there a problem?

724
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:28,434
Yes. Actually, being
here feels very...

725
00:29:28,435 --> 00:29:29,902
inappropriate.

726
00:29:29,903 --> 00:29:32,105
What's inappropriate?
Please,

727
00:29:32,106 --> 00:29:34,107
it's obvious that you
have feelings for a man

728
00:29:34,108 --> 00:29:36,075
that is about to be
married to another woman.

729
00:29:36,076 --> 00:29:38,176
So?

730
00:29:38,177 --> 00:29:41,480
So I'm worried that you might
be getting into a situation

731
00:29:41,481 --> 00:29:43,181
where you could
get hurt, Zoe.

732
00:29:43,182 --> 00:29:44,916
Wait, why should
you be worried?

733
00:29:44,917 --> 00:29:46,618
I mean, we're only
colleagues, remember?

734
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:49,654
Zoe, look...
What?

735
00:29:49,655 --> 00:29:52,724
The way you're talking
to me right now, it's
almost like you're my dad!

736
00:29:52,725 --> 00:29:54,758
But that is crazy.

737
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:55,892
Right, Ethan?

738
00:29:57,229 --> 00:29:59,130
Okay. I-I...

739
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:01,298
I can see that you're upset.

740
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,334
Oh, yeah? Well,
why should I be upset?

741
00:30:03,335 --> 00:30:06,470
Because the one man
that I have looked
up to my entire life,

742
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:09,373
the man who I thought
was my father up
until eight months ago,

743
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:10,773
abandoned me?

744
00:30:10,774 --> 00:30:13,243
Stopped returning
my phone calls

745
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:14,710
without any explanation
as to why!

746
00:30:14,711 --> 00:30:16,746
Turned me into the kind of girl

747
00:30:16,747 --> 00:30:18,314
who was so desperate
for affection,

748
00:30:18,315 --> 00:30:21,050
she doesn't know how to be
in relationships with men!

749
00:30:21,051 --> 00:30:23,019
Look, I didn't know
that you were angry.

750
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,787
Of course I'm angry!

751
00:30:24,788 --> 00:30:26,122
I have every right
to be, okay?

752
00:30:26,123 --> 00:30:27,823
I don't want to be
your frickin' friend.

753
00:30:27,824 --> 00:30:29,491
In fact, I would
rather go back

754
00:30:29,492 --> 00:30:31,260
to having no relationship
with you at all

755
00:30:31,261 --> 00:30:32,928
than having
some crappy fake one.

756
00:30:32,929 --> 00:30:35,564
So if you have nothing else
to say to me,

757
00:30:35,565 --> 00:30:37,232
why don't you
go back to New York.

758
00:30:41,504 --> 00:30:43,638
Lemon! You know what?

759
00:30:43,639 --> 00:30:45,740
I-I think I will take
that tour, after all.

MAYNARD: All right,

772
00:31:26,587 --> 00:31:29,823
all right, all right, now,
our final signature cocktail

773
00:31:29,824 --> 00:31:31,124
of the evening is

774
00:31:31,125 --> 00:31:32,858
brought to you by Shelley Ng.

775
00:31:32,859 --> 00:31:34,360
I call it...

776
00:31:34,361 --> 00:31:36,028
The Vanilla Viper!

777
00:31:36,029 --> 00:31:37,229
(whooping)

778
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:39,765
Ooh! It tastes like a cupcake.

779
00:31:39,766 --> 00:31:41,767
That was the idea.
MAYNARD: All right, all right,

780
00:31:41,768 --> 00:31:45,271
now all the drinks are in--
it's time to cast your votes.

781
00:31:45,272 --> 00:31:47,940
All those in favor
of Wade Kinsella,

782
00:31:47,941 --> 00:31:49,174
raise your hand!

783
00:31:49,175 --> 00:31:52,077
(cheers, shouts, whoops)

784
00:31:52,078 --> 00:31:53,511
LAVON:
Come on, come on!

785
00:31:53,512 --> 00:31:54,946
All right, all right,

786
00:31:54,947 --> 00:31:57,048
those in favor of Shelley Ng,

787
00:31:57,049 --> 00:31:58,116
raise your hands!

788
00:31:58,117 --> 00:32:00,452
(loud cheering)

789
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,154
Congratulations, Shelley Ng.

790
00:32:03,155 --> 00:32:04,721
You are our winner.

791
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:09,326
There something wrong
with this girl?

792
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:13,897
♪ I'm gonna love you till
you're sick, sick, sick of me ♪

793
00:32:13,898 --> 00:32:15,632
Sorry about that, man.

794
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:16,967
I thought you had it in the bag.

795
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:18,302
It's all right.

796
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:20,769
It's, uh, it's only a contest.

797
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:23,572
I can be
your consolation prize.

798
00:32:23,573 --> 00:32:26,109
Well, appreciate it, Wanda.

799
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,843
Maybe some other time.

800
00:32:31,448 --> 00:32:33,149
And the staircase is original.

801
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:34,650
It was hand carved
by my granddaddy

802
00:32:34,651 --> 00:32:36,451
many, many, many years ago.

803
00:32:36,452 --> 00:32:37,852
You know what, uh,
thanks for the tour,

804
00:32:37,853 --> 00:32:39,388
but I think I'm
gonna get going.

805
00:32:39,389 --> 00:32:40,922
No, but we haven't
had dinner yet,

806
00:32:40,923 --> 00:32:42,690
and I made all this food
for our party.

807
00:32:42,691 --> 00:32:44,259
I don't think there's
much of a party anymore.

808
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,094
It's just me, you, and George.

809
00:32:46,095 --> 00:32:47,262
So what?

810
00:32:47,263 --> 00:32:48,530
You know what?

811
00:32:48,531 --> 00:32:49,931
I've been thinking
the three of us

812
00:32:49,932 --> 00:32:51,599
need to spend
more time together anyway.

813
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,866
And...

814
00:32:55,404 --> 00:32:58,839
...I have made a huge...

815
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,042
error in judgment,

816
00:33:01,043 --> 00:33:04,178
and you simply

817
00:33:04,179 --> 00:33:06,947
must come to our wedding.

818
00:33:06,948 --> 00:33:08,681
(laughs and snorts)
Sorry.

819
00:33:08,682 --> 00:33:10,216
What's so funny?
Come on.

820
00:33:10,217 --> 00:33:11,584
You want me at your wedding

821
00:33:11,585 --> 00:33:13,420
about as much as I want
to go to your wedding.

822
00:33:13,421 --> 00:33:15,355
Oh, so you don't want
to come to my wedding now?

823
00:33:15,356 --> 00:33:17,123
Well, frankly, that just
really hurts my feelings.

824
00:33:17,124 --> 00:33:18,425
Cut the crap, Lemon.

825
00:33:18,426 --> 00:33:19,559
ok, I don't know

826
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,993
what crazy plan
you had for tonight,

827
00:33:20,994 --> 00:33:22,828
but I'm sure there was
something devious going on.

828
00:33:22,829 --> 00:33:25,464
How dare you, after everything
that I've done tonight

829
00:33:25,465 --> 00:33:27,132
to make everything...
Look,

830
00:33:27,133 --> 00:33:29,634
I know that you
know that I know.

831
00:33:29,635 --> 00:33:31,970
And you're probably thinking

832
00:33:31,971 --> 00:33:33,605
that I'm going to tell George.

833
00:33:33,606 --> 00:33:35,941
But there's something
that you need to understand.

834
00:33:35,942 --> 00:33:39,578
I'm never telling George
or anyone else, for that matter.

835
00:33:41,646 --> 00:33:43,614
Well, forgive me
if I don't believe you.

836
00:33:46,552 --> 00:33:48,018
Why would you do that for me?

837
00:33:48,019 --> 00:33:49,653
I'm not doing it for you.

838
00:33:49,654 --> 00:33:52,290
But Lavon is my best friend,

839
00:33:52,291 --> 00:33:54,459
and I would never
betray his trust.

840
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:56,393
Plus, why would I want
to be the person

841
00:33:56,394 --> 00:33:58,128
to tell George?

842
00:33:58,129 --> 00:33:59,596
Why wouldn't you?

843
00:33:59,597 --> 00:34:01,131
Because I have no interest

844
00:34:01,132 --> 00:34:03,500
in being the person
to break George's heart.

845
00:34:03,501 --> 00:34:05,935
But, for what it's worth,

846
00:34:05,936 --> 00:34:08,738
I do think
that you should tell him.

847
00:34:36,262 --> 00:34:37,729
Hey.

848
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:38,864
Glass of wine?

849
00:34:38,865 --> 00:34:40,065
Shot of tequila?

850
00:34:40,066 --> 00:34:42,099
Oh, rough night?

851
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,500
Weird night.
Huh.

852
00:34:43,501 --> 00:34:45,302
Turns out that Lemon

853
00:34:45,303 --> 00:34:48,272
isn't the complete psychopath
I thought she was.

854
00:34:48,273 --> 00:34:50,374
But unfortunately,
my father is.

855
00:34:50,375 --> 00:34:52,442
You were

856
00:34:52,443 --> 00:34:54,478
with Lemon?

857
00:34:54,479 --> 00:34:56,380
And how is she?

858
00:34:56,381 --> 00:34:58,447
(laughing)
Are you drunk?

859
00:34:58,448 --> 00:34:59,615
We're, uh,

860
00:34:59,616 --> 00:35:00,583
we're calling it tipsy.

861
00:35:00,584 --> 00:35:01,717
He is the mayor,

862
00:35:01,718 --> 00:35:03,153
after all.
Keep it down.

863
00:35:03,154 --> 00:35:04,720
I've never seen drunk Lavon.

864
00:35:04,721 --> 00:35:06,355
He's so cute.

865
00:35:06,356 --> 00:35:08,491
Thank you.

866
00:35:08,492 --> 00:35:10,393
I like myself.

867
00:35:10,394 --> 00:35:11,828
Oh, boy.

868
00:35:11,829 --> 00:35:13,829
So, I take it, uh...

869
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:15,764
I take it things didn't go
too well with your dad?

870
00:35:15,765 --> 00:35:17,966
Turns out that you were wrong.

871
00:35:17,967 --> 00:35:19,802
I was able to tell him off.

872
00:35:19,803 --> 00:35:22,504
But, in doing so,
I completely ruined any chance

873
00:35:22,505 --> 00:35:23,939
of having a relationship
with the man.

874
00:35:25,708 --> 00:35:27,075
I'm sorry.

875
00:35:27,076 --> 00:35:28,976
No, that's okay,
it's better this way.

876
00:35:28,977 --> 00:35:30,812
You know, I would rather
be honest than angry.

877
00:35:30,813 --> 00:35:31,512
That's beautiful.

878
00:35:31,513 --> 00:35:34,615
Honest and angry.

879
00:35:34,616 --> 00:35:36,617
Mmm, damn that's good.

880
00:35:36,618 --> 00:35:38,519
I am going to go home,
though,

881
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,621
and erase the last 48 hours
from my mind.

882
00:35:40,622 --> 00:35:42,723
See you guys later.

883
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:43,958
Bye-e-e-e.

884
00:35:45,927 --> 00:35:48,995
Guess you won't be needing this,
so I'll just take it.

885
00:35:48,996 --> 00:35:50,964
That's all.

886
00:35:52,566 --> 00:35:54,500
You-you didn't
serve this tonight.

887
00:35:57,972 --> 00:35:59,172
You tanked the contest.

888
00:35:59,173 --> 00:36:00,740
Can't prove that.

889
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:02,474
Wait, well, I don't understand

890
00:36:02,475 --> 00:36:04,143
why would yododo
something like that?

891
00:36:04,144 --> 00:36:07,279
Look, I'm not gonna give
Mayner my best stuff.

892
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,915
I got to save some of my
own ideas for my own menu.

893
00:36:11,051 --> 00:36:12,852
For when I open my own bar.

894
00:36:12,853 --> 00:36:14,419
Oh.

895
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,587
Huh? Huh?

896
00:36:15,588 --> 00:36:16,722
Love it.

897
00:36:16,723 --> 00:36:17,822
Love it.

898
00:36:17,823 --> 00:36:18,923
Love it.
Come on, now.

899
00:36:29,634 --> 00:36:31,936
People really do
leave their doors open

900
00:36:31,937 --> 00:36:33,503
in small towns, huh?

901
00:36:38,776 --> 00:36:40,510
I'm not good
with confrontations.

902
00:36:40,511 --> 00:36:43,646
I think that one
of the reasons that I, uh,

903
00:36:43,647 --> 00:36:46,716
chose cardiothoracics
was because I knew that

904
00:36:46,717 --> 00:36:48,985
by the time my patients
got to me,

905
00:36:48,986 --> 00:36:51,620
they wouldn't have time
to argue.

906
00:36:51,621 --> 00:36:54,056
I don't understand.

907
00:36:54,057 --> 00:36:57,059
I knew what I was
offering you was crap.

908
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,861
I was just hoping
you would take it

909
00:36:58,862 --> 00:37:01,230
so that we wouldn't have
to do this part.

910
00:37:01,231 --> 00:37:04,700
(sighs) This part is hard.

911
00:37:04,701 --> 00:37:07,135
Which part?

912
00:37:07,136 --> 00:37:09,204
The part where I tell you
how wrong I was.

913
00:37:09,205 --> 00:37:11,273
That I screwed everything up,

914
00:37:11,274 --> 00:37:12,740
and I didn't know how

915
00:37:12,741 --> 00:37:16,878
to make it any better,
so I just...

916
00:37:16,879 --> 00:37:18,413
didn't.

917
00:37:20,283 --> 00:37:21,481
But...

918
00:37:21,482 --> 00:37:24,118
you're right to hate me, Zoe.

919
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:27,654
I don't hate you.

920
00:37:27,655 --> 00:37:31,091
I just don't understand
why you did what you did.

921
00:37:31,092 --> 00:37:32,692
I was mad

922
00:37:32,693 --> 00:37:35,095
at your mom.

923
00:37:35,096 --> 00:37:37,463
And then at you, even though
it wasn't your fault.

924
00:37:37,464 --> 00:37:39,132
I couldn't even
look at you

925
00:37:39,133 --> 00:37:42,268
after I found out
the truth.

926
00:37:42,269 --> 00:37:44,770
And then it just became...

927
00:37:44,771 --> 00:37:47,773
easier to take surgeries
out of town.

928
00:37:47,774 --> 00:37:49,542
To do lectures.

929
00:37:49,543 --> 00:37:51,610
Anything to keep me away
from dealing with you,

930
00:37:51,611 --> 00:37:52,711
because...

931
00:37:52,712 --> 00:37:55,948
I literally didn't know...

932
00:37:55,949 --> 00:37:59,451
how to be your father anymore.

933
00:37:59,452 --> 00:38:02,620
So, I just quit.

934
00:38:02,621 --> 00:38:04,289
And then you called me
the other day,

935
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:07,692
and I thought maybe I could find
another way to be with you.

936
00:38:07,693 --> 00:38:10,061
You seemed open to the idea.

937
00:38:10,062 --> 00:38:11,862
But when I saw you with George,

938
00:38:11,863 --> 00:38:14,765
I just felt so protective,

939
00:38:14,766 --> 00:38:17,335
and my paternal instincts
just kicked in,

940
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:18,735
and I didn't want
to see you get hurt.

941
00:38:18,736 --> 00:38:21,772
And I know
that's not fair.

942
00:38:21,773 --> 00:38:24,708
Because I know
that I have...

943
00:38:24,709 --> 00:38:26,677
I've hurt you more than anyone.

944
00:38:30,314 --> 00:38:32,182
I'm so sorry, Zoe.

945
00:38:39,223 --> 00:38:41,191
Do you think you could ever
be my daughter again?

946
00:38:43,393 --> 00:38:46,596
Even when I was mad, I never
stopped being your daughter.

947
00:38:50,767 --> 00:38:52,368
Then maybe you can wait
a little while

948
00:38:52,369 --> 00:38:53,603
before you officially change
your last name?

949
00:38:53,604 --> 00:38:54,770
Because I can't imagine

950
00:38:54,771 --> 00:38:57,406
you being anyone
other than Zoe Hart.

951
00:38:57,407 --> 00:38:59,340
Dr. Zoe Hart.

952
00:38:59,341 --> 00:39:01,710
Mister.

953
00:39:09,051 --> 00:39:11,653
I know these past few
days haven't been easy,

954
00:39:11,654 --> 00:39:15,990
and I have not
been easy on you.

955
00:39:15,991 --> 00:39:19,026
Baby, you have been
under so much stress.

956
00:39:19,027 --> 00:39:21,228
I understand.

957
00:39:21,229 --> 00:39:22,897
I know you do.

958
00:39:24,699 --> 00:39:26,266
I can't...

959
00:39:26,267 --> 00:39:29,136
(sighs) You're not the reason
my dad had a heart attack,

960
00:39:29,137 --> 00:39:32,805
and it was wrong of me
to say those things.

961
00:39:32,806 --> 00:39:33,907
I was just...
I was upset and...

962
00:39:33,908 --> 00:39:35,174
I know, baby, I know.

963
00:39:35,175 --> 00:39:36,776
I just was looking
for someone to blame.

964
00:39:36,777 --> 00:39:38,878
And this Zoe thing,
I just... I feel like...
Hey.

965
00:39:48,688 --> 00:39:52,858
Let's not talk about
Zoe Hart anymore.

966
00:39:54,661 --> 00:39:56,094
Okay.
Okay?

967
00:39:56,095 --> 00:39:59,031
In fact, why don't you and I

968
00:39:59,032 --> 00:40:00,766
head over to the Rammer Jammer,

969
00:40:00,767 --> 00:40:02,366
because I think

970
00:40:02,367 --> 00:40:05,670
that you and I need
to have a good time.

971
00:40:05,671 --> 00:40:06,737
Hm?

972
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:08,405
I think
it sounds amazing.

973
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,240
I do, unfortunately,

974
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,509
I promised my mom that I'd
go back to the hospital

975
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:14,211
tonight, so...
I'll go with you.

976
00:40:15,781 --> 00:40:17,081
No.

977
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:19,449
No, you know what, I
want you to go on ahead

978
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:22,452
to the Rammer Jammer; I inink
you should have a good time,

979
00:40:22,453 --> 00:40:24,353
because, baby, hey,

980
00:40:24,354 --> 00:40:25,755
you deserve it.

981
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:27,991
All right.

982
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:29,459
Just one drink.

983
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,427
Just one. One drink.

984
00:40:31,428 --> 00:40:33,696
(both chuckling)

985
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:34,997
Drive safe.
I will.

986
00:40:34,998 --> 00:40:36,431
I'll call you
so a as I get there.

987
00:40:36,432 --> 00:40:37,800
I love you.

988
00:40:37,801 --> 00:40:39,234
Love you, too.

989
00:40:39,235 --> 00:40:40,302
Have fun.

990
00:40:40,303 --> 00:40:41,269
Not too much fun, though.

991
00:40:49,345 --> 00:40:51,178
Lemon.

992
00:40:51,179 --> 00:40:54,215
Hello, Mr. Mayor.

993
00:40:54,216 --> 00:40:56,250
You were right.

994
00:40:56,251 --> 00:40:59,253
I mean...

995
00:40:59,254 --> 00:41:00,655
I think you might
have been right.

996
00:41:00,656 --> 00:41:03,825
Have you been drinking?

997
00:41:03,826 --> 00:41:06,326
Well, I've been
thinking maybe...

998
00:41:06,327 --> 00:41:08,495
I told you about Zoe

999
00:41:08,496 --> 00:41:11,364
because I wanted you
to tell George.

1000
00:41:11,365 --> 00:41:12,565
Oh...

1001
00:41:17,138 --> 00:41:18,805
What the hell?

1002
00:41:18,806 --> 00:41:18,872
One drink.

1003
00:41:20,374 --> 00:41:21,907
One drink.

1004
00:41:21,908 --> 00:41:23,976
I keep thinking about it;
would it be so bad

1005
00:41:23,977 --> 00:41:25,511
if he found out?
Oh, Lavon, don't.

1006
00:41:25,512 --> 00:41:26,979
'Cause if he broke up with you

1007
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:29,481
I would be here, Lemon.

1008
00:41:29,482 --> 00:41:31,316
I would be here for you.

1009
00:41:38,223 --> 00:41:39,290
I'm sorry.

1010
00:41:55,404 --> 00:41:57,506
