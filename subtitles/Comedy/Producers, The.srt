No time. Running late...

Lipstick, lipstick...

00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:52,519
Hello, you're one of the new hires
at KBS this year, right?

6
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,520
Yes.

7
00:00:53,521 --> 00:00:57,699
- Why are you running?
- I think I'm late to the welcome ceremony.

Do you know where TS-1 is?

9
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,870
Follow me.

10
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,999
Yes?

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,219
I have a live broadcast today
so I'm going to be busy.

12
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,510
Yes. Oh no...

13
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,549
Oh my. I'm going to kill myself.

14
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:19,480
I'll call you back later.

15
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:23,710
My goodness, what do I do.

16
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:27,879
I mean, what kind of a...

17
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:32,530
parking job is this?
No manners.

18
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:38,490
Uh, oh. Oh no, what do I do.

19

I'm following new employees today.

21

Did you by chance film what happened here?
The car door?

22
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,840
Yes...

23
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:12,809

be somewhere...

We'll begin the ceremony...

26
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,399
- As CEO of KBS...
- I swear...

27
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,040
I swear!

28
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,689
[How do you feel now?] - Even during
training, it didn't feel real.

29
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:34,049
But, after receiving this and this...

30
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:36,450
it all feels more real now.

31
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,699
[What's your first month salary?]
- Am I allowed to say?

32
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,069
Around 1,890,000 won was
deposited to my account.

33
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:51,400
I withdrew all of it in cash and
gave it to my mother.

34
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:55,559
She cried.

35
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,860
Actually, I was unemployed
for four years.

36
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:09,019
[Why did you apply to the
Variety Department?]

37
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,320
Um.

38
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:15,170
Are there reasons that can't be shared?

39
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:20,119
Oh. Not exactly...

40
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:24,329
The... the person I like

41
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:27,069
works in the Variety Department.
So...

42
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:29,670
She was my senior when I was in
college. We were in the same club.

43
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:34,830
Because I hoped to work
near her...

44
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:57,200
If she became a reporter instead, then you
would've taken the reporter's exam?

45
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,250
If she became an accountant, then
an accounting exam?

20, 2015 11 a.m. - OJT meeting starts.]

48
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:23,270
I'm Kim Tae Ho PD from the
Variety Department.

49
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,639
- The one that produced 'Infinity Challenge'?
- MBC. KBS.

50
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,680
- Why? I'm Kim Tae Ho. [Kim Tae Ho,
45 years old. Variety Department CP]

51
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:36,610
I get it. I hear there's someone at
MBC with a similar name as mine?

52
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,399
I came before him.
I'm the original Kim Tae Ho.

53
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,989
- Okay.
- Oh.

54
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,580
I know he's pretty good too.

55
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,780
He has some talent too, I guess?

56
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,499
We have a busy schedule today.

57
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,519
We used to get rookies to just tour
the recording studio for a few days.

58
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,529
But, that's very ineffective.

59
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:02,719
Since the latest trend is creativity,
competition, and alike...

60
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,029
on the job training (OJT), which
used to be five days long

61
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:10,829
will be conducted in just one day by
being creative and more economical.

62
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,410
Yes, sir.

63
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:17,969
If you feel that this condensed
training doesn't

64
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:23,009
allow you to learn the frame or certain
details of the Variety Department...

65
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:26,629
you can purchase a good book from
the store later.

66
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:30,850
There's a book titled
'What is a Variety Department PD?'.

67
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:35,679
There are many books with similar titles,
but with sub par quality.

68
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,030
So don't get confused.

69
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:44,119
[What is Variety Department PD? By Kim Tae Ho] -
Others urged me to write this book, so I did.

70
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,119
It's not like I'm trying to sell
my books here.

71
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,169
I don't get that much royalty.
Seriously.

72
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:55,049
I'm just trying to do a greater good...

73
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,619
by recommending this book.

74
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:00,939
Oh, when I was preparing for the
written examination

75
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:05,580
I bought it thinking that Kim PD
from 'Infinity Challenge" wrote it.

76
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:08,949
I wasn't the only one.
There were many others.

77
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:11,740
I hear that many copies
were returned.

78
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,110
But because I wrote my name here...

79
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,510
I couldn't return...

80
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:27,900
Alright, where should we start?
Oh right. There.

- Sound familiar?
- Yes.

83
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:40,229
Hey Kwang Soo...
Oh your show aired yesterday, right?

84
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:43,929
Here... is what you'll see every morning.
The ratings list.

85
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:46,139
To us, this is like a report card.

86
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:49,039
- Uh, don't please.
- Why?

87
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,320
You got seven. Seven?

88
00:06:55,040 --> 00:07:00,119
It's a good rating.
It's not easy to get seven these days.

89
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,130
- With season finales and cable channels...
- Give it to me.

90
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,699
Okay, let's get going now.

91
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,590
Oh, 'Immortal Song'.

92
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:15,389
Jae Young. Jae Young!
Since it's a music show...

93
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:18,460
the producer listens to music
all day long.

94
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:22,870
Hey, you should take it easy.
You'll damage your ears at this rate.

95
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:30,279
Since this is the new hires' OJT...

96
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:36,039
unlike training, we're supposed to learn from
observing the workings of the department.

97
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,240
So I came with very high expectations.

98
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:45,999
The CP has been fervently teaching
us this and that...

99
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,669
But, occasionally,
I found myself confused.

100
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:53,150
'Should I take down notes to record
what he's saying, or not?'

Everyone, watch me carefully.

Writer Lee Mi Rim, this
week's gag concert tickets?

103

I don't have any.

You saw, right?

105
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,309
This is very important. Life in the Variety
Department can be summed up in tickets.

106
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,889
What do I mean by that?

107
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,979
From now, whenever you meet people,
all conversations

108
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,799
will eventually end with a request
for gag concert tickets.

109
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,789
It's good to say 'no' from
the beginning.

110
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,080
Why?

111
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:26,690
Because you won't get any.

112
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,520
She really doesn't give out any.

Where's Bong Ki?
He pulled an all-nighter again, didn't he.

117
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:57,180
Will his body be able to survive?

118
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,020
Good quality work doesn't come
out of thin air.

119
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:07,919
Well, last night, PD Bong Ki...

As for me, I buy like 30 at once.

Don't go out to eat near Hongik University

Food here is good.

126
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:33,439
Good for building relationships
with colleagues.

127
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:39,720
But, most of all, this is where you can get all
kinds of information related to broadcasts.

Right? They are getting divorced, right?
I knew they would since their wedding.

On really hot days, they
serve chicken ginseng stew.

Occasionally, we get special meal days
like Japanese and Chinese food.

What kind of accident?
Were you hurt?

No, not that kind of accident.

00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:05,409
I don't think they'd like it very much.
I apologize.

304
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:08,739
It's good that you apologize
quickly, PD Ra Joon Mo.

305
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:14,560
But, you're always back in here again,
so as for your sincerity...

306
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:24,629
Gosh, all this over a booger.

307
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:26,979
Oh! Reporter Kang.

308
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:29,849
Oh? You're here again!

309
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:34,129
A PD should be at the station.
Why are you always here?

310
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:35,539
That's what I'm saying.

311
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:38,520
Stop writing negative pieces about
my show.

312
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:42,759
Well, once your show's gone,
I won't be able to write them.

313
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,149
What are you talking about?

314
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:46,439
I heard your show is getting canceled.

315
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,109
- Huh?
- It's not true?

316
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:53,939
If that were true, I'm the PD.
Wouldn't I know about it?

317
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,519
It's just common sense.

318
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:00,899
When a program is getting axed,
the producer seems to be the last to know.

319
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:05,120
What, seriously...
Where are you hearing these weird things?

320
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:13,120
Why wouldn't I know my own show? Huh?
I'm... I'm the PD! I am!

321
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:23,259
2 Days, 1 Night... Season 1.

322
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:27,449
When Young Suk and Myung Hwan were here,
things were really good back then.

323
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:29,380
Kang Ho Dong and Lee Seung Gi...

324
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:33,420
But, in Season 2 things were
a little shaky.

325
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:38,059
And then Season 3, Yoo Ho Jin
actually did pretty well.

326
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:42,229
After that, it was passed onto me.
It's all the same really.

327
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:45,100
A bunch of guys come out and
do this and that.

328
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,429
So, we completely changed everything.

329
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:51,360
A 2 Days 1 Night with female actresses.
It's innovative!

330
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:55,700
2 Days... 1 Night...

331
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:02,959
Can you try being more in unison
and say 2 Days and 1 Night loudly together?

332
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,929
2 Days... 1 Night!

333
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:07,559
Yes.

334
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:10,630
For our Spring Special,
we'll be going to Geojedo.

335
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:15,189
Where? Geojedo?
I can't go.

336
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:18,809
Let's just stay in Kyungki.
Why do you want to go so far?

337
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:22,439
I have a gastric ulcer.
Don't feed me stuff like fish extract.

338
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,919
If the toilet is an outhouse like
last time, I'm not going.

339
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:30,289
And sleeping outside? Do you want to
see me get joint pain and die? I can't.

340
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:31,429
Yeah.

341
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:33,849
We should go to some campgrounds
nearby and just shoot.

342
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:35,989
Just because you go far away,
you don't get ratings.

343
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:38,149
How can we go to Geojedo?

344
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:40,420
It's so cold right now.

345
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:43,209
Other programs seem to have
no problem making it fun without going.

346
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:47,190
But, the thing is...
It must've been too innovative.

347
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:51,939
The ratings are, well...
honestly they've hit rock bottom.

348
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:54,760
That's why there are false rumors
like this going around.

349
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:59,459
But, times of crisis are also
an opportunity.

350
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,300
I'm not that worried.

351
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:14,500
[5:00 PM -
2 Days 1 Night Meeting Room]

352
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:19,480
Can you please sit down?
You're giving me a headache.

353
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:22,909
Where's Writer Choi?

354
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:26,670
I just spoke to her.
She's crossing the Mapo bridge.

355
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,299
She'll be here soon.

356
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:32,619
Things sure are going well, huh?

357
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:36,219
There are all sorts of rumors flying
around and the main writer is missing.

358
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,790
What rumors?

359
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:42,459
What's the item for next week?
Do you have it?

360
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,719
Why don't we go to Jejudo?

361
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,920
Last season, where did we go
for our last episode?

362
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,409
Jejudo.

363
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:52,590
What about Mamma Mia?
That program that got canceled?

364
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,549
- Jejudo.
- That's right!

365
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:58,309
When a show is truly desperate,
they go to Jejudo.

366
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:00,999
When you start to think,
we need to go to Jejudo...

367
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,169
your show has come to
the end of its run.

368
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:07,240
But, last week Infinity Challenge went to
Jejudo and they had great ratings.

369
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,680
Are you stupid?
That show's run by Producer Kim Tae Ho.

370
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:18,199
Producer? What happened to Miss A
possibly appearing on our show this week?

371
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,160
There was that schedule conflict with
Music Bank you're trying to work out.

372
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:27,150
- It's not going to work, is it?
- It will!

373
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:31,060
If I call, it will work out.
Miss A.

374
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:35,499
If you run a big show like Music Bank,
you tend to get a lot of requests.

375
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,259
Requests from your work seniors,
the Department Chief...

376
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:41,219
No matter what, you've just got to
reject them all and move on.

377
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:44,669
If you do everything they ask,
the requests will never end.

378
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:49,509
Even if the President comes and asks,
you need to know how to say 'No'.

379
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:53,069
I'll be here longer than the President
anyways, right?

380
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:57,570
Of course, I'm sure you all will be here
longer than I will.

381
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:08,630
- What?
- I need to ask a favor.

382
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,660
A favor?

383
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,980
Oh, hold on.

384
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,250
[Joon Bal]

385
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:23,909
So, what favor do you need from me
Ra Joon Mo PD?

386
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:27,369
I need Miss A on my show next week,
but because of Music Bank...

387
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:30,409
- Can you do a prerecording for them?
- No.

388
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:32,089
I have many singers going on that day.

389
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:35,470
Gosh, PD of Music Bank...
just do me this favor.

390
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:40,239
If I take out Miss A, I have to adjust
the entire line-up.

391
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,470
Please don't latch onto me to solve your
issues and take care of it on your own.

392
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,559
So, keep this in mind.

393
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,739
In this industry, you have to have
your own back.

394
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:02,849
If you're out there helping others,
in the end you'll be left with nothing.

395
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:05,690
Take care of yourself.
Okay?

396
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:10,459
Okay, should we slowly head up now?

397
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,890
Oh my...

398
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:17,040
Wait... just wait.
Let's go in a little bit.

399
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:19,360
Latch onto her?

400
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:25,200
Who is she saying I'm latching onto?
She has no clue what's going on.

401
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:26,749
Is it going to happen or not?

402
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:29,309
I need to know if I have to
find materials or not.

403
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:34,219
Just hold on a second!
She shouldn't be this way to me!

404
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:36,379
Gosh, seriously!

405
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:40,990
Hey, PD Ra... the Department Chief is
looking for you.

406
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,849
What is it?
You must know something.

407
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:52,859
What would I know?

408
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:58,209
I met Reporter Kang at the KCC.
He was saying some strange things.

409
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:01,210
How did that go, by the way?

410
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:07,049
Even that, other CP's go to the KCC
on behalf of the PD's and support them.

411
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:08,819
Did I really have to go there?

412
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:13,679
You look good in a suit.
And I only have suits for funerals.

413
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:17,400
- So, you really don't know anything?
- What would I know?

414
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:24,809
How many times have you been to
the KCC this month now?

415
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:28,080
What is it this time? A warning?

416
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:35,589
Still, because I go so often,
there are people who are friendly to me.

417
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:40,209
There are people who say,
it is very regrettable.

418
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:42,959
I don't think they will slap us with
a warning this time.

419
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,120
You must be proud.

420
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:47,909
It really is strange.

421
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:53,690
How could all the age groups not be
watching your show?

422
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:57,519
Chief, if you look here... right here...

423
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,499
there are portions with sudden rises.

424
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,489
People have caught wind of it.

425
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:06,439
I don't know about wind or whatever,
but it's definitely game over, Joon Mo.

426
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,049
Tae Ho.

427
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:12,259
Honestly, is 5.7 acceptable for a
Sunday variety show?

428
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:15,689
Back in the day, when I did Super Sunday
with Lim Baek Chun...

429
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:19,659
the ratings went up to 35.

430
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:23,909
Our theme song back then was,
the Pet Shop Boy's, Go West.

431
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:26,209
- It was such a good song.
- It really was.

432
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:32,249
Chief, these days there are so many
mediums. Today's 5.7 is like a 15.

433
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:36,920
That's just the excuse people with 5.7
ratings make.

434
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:42,169
There's just no answer.
Let's just pull the plug.

435
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:43,689
What?

436
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:47,319
- Chief!
- It's already been decided.

437
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,890
- Tae Ho, did you know?
- You didn't know?

438
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:52,349
The entire variety department knew.

439
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:55,480
The lady who sells spicy rice cakes in
front of the station knew. Why didn't you?

440
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,220
Tae Ho!

441
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:00,389
Chief...

442
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:04,589
You, yourself, okayed the idea to have
the older ladies on the variety show.

443
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:07,600
Yeah I did, so you
should've done a good job.

444
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:12,840
One year ago, what did you say when
you started this program?

445
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:17,750
You said if Na Young Seok hit a triple,
then you'd hit a home run.

446
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,399
This isn't a home run.
It's a double play.

447
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,819
Oh... I really didn't know about this.

448
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:27,729
The game was over,
but here I was by myself...

449
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:32,600
Like a fool, bunting and stealing bases
all day and night.

450
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:35,249
Pull the plug?

451
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:39,790
What do you mean, pull the plug?
I can't do that!

452
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,369
- Didn't you tell him in advance?
- Of course I did.

453
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:49,849
He just doesn't seem to get it.

454
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:52,139
He only has old ladies as guests.

455
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:55,560
He spends all that money and has on
ratings this low. He has no conscience.

456
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,349
Don't you think so?

457
00:31:57,350 --> 00:32:00,739
What if he goes to the union or
something?

458
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,960
What could he possibly say to them?

459
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:05,969
This isn't a political program with
controversial topics.

460
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:08,349
We're pulling the plug because it's
unpopular.

461
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:11,309
Now that I think about it,
Na Young Seok was really good.

462
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:13,800
Isn't there any way we could bring
him back?

463
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,469
We're going to go to Jejudo.

464
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:38,240
- We can't do Jejudo.
- How about leodo?

465
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:44,159
Well, I feel like...

466
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:47,929
a head of family with elementary,
junior high, and high school student kids

467
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:50,040
that has suddenly become unemployed.

468
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:54,750
How am I supposed to take care of them?
How am I supposed to feed them?

469
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:59,159
I'm blood type A.

470
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:05,080
That means I'm already very responsible.
This is becoming more important.

471
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,290
What about me?

472
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:25,960
What happens to me?

473
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:31,169
You would've talked about what
happens to the PD. Am I gone too?

474
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:34,509
You have to tell me that
so I can make plans.

475
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:37,400
You're not going anywhere.

476
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:46,520
I'm just saying, pick out some new
members and go at it again.

477
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,609
Starting when?

478
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:52,639
What do you mean when?
Immediately.

479
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,809
Huh?

480
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:57,209
Look here. Next week, there will be
soccer programming.

481
00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:00,289
The following week, they can play
the highlights. You have two weeks.

482
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:01,759
I can't do it in two weeks.

483
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,309
Then, should I look at another team
that's been preparing a variety program?

484
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:07,230
Considering external teams,
we have several.

485
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,629
I'll get it done.

486
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:14,729
Okay. The most urgent thing now is
letting the team members know.

487
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:16,299
Chief.

488
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:21,630
Tomorrow, we're having a one year
anniversary dinner with everyone there.

489
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,769
How can I say that at a
place like that?

490
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:26,649
Oh yeah?
Well, things got simple then.

491
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:31,009
- What?
- You can tell them and do a goodbye party.

492
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:33,139
Then, you can save the cost of a
goodbye party.

493
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:36,419
When things start to work out,
they really do.

494
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:39,400
Where are you all meeting?

495
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,309
At Bi Bong, in front of the station.

496
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:45,720
If it's the dinner course,
it's quite expensive per person.

497
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:49,609
But, it's not bad for the price.

498
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:54,919
The Mae Course comes with pine nut
porridge. It's delicious.

499
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:59,949
Yes, it is. But, will
everyone have the Mae Course?

500
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:02,419
It wouldn't just be one or two people.

501
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:06,799
Should we order the Ran Course?
That one is about 30,000 per person.

502
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,549
There's no porridge in the Ran Course.

503
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:13,139
- You can add it on the side.
- Even the pine nut porridge?

504
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,700
Yes, even the pine nuts.

505
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:20,669
Then, we'll do the Ran course meal
with pine nut porridge.

506
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:25,429
So, wait...
We're not filming the last episode?

507
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:29,470
All you think about is spending money.
Don't you think about the company?

508
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,439
Okay.

509
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,659
Then during the dinner tomorrow

510
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:38,520
you're going to announce it to
everyone right, Chief?

511
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,079
I told you. You have to announce it
before the dinner.

512
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,970
Do you want to have pine nut porridge
bowls being thrown around?

513
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:56,129
When a new program starts,
it's like a baby's first birthday.

514
00:35:56,130 --> 00:36:02,669
Everyone comes out to give you blessings.
And you just smile for no reason.

515
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:06,259
When a program is coming to an end,
it's like a funeral.

516
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:12,319
Especially when it's a lowly rated program,
nobody shows up.

517
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:16,100
There are no visitors and no money.

518
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,330
It's very lonely.

519
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:24,149
I think this line was pretty good.

520
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:27,240
Don't edit it out.
It was a really good figure of speech.

521
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:41,619
What was the important thing you
had to talk to me about?

522
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:46,069
Oh, it's nothing really.
It's not that important.

523
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:49,269
Is Cindy on Music Bank today?

524
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:50,899
Yes, she's up for the number one spot.

525
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:54,699
My second daughter is a fan of hers.

526
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:59,819
And she just happens to be in Yeouido.

527
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:02,520
She's riding her bike with her friends.

528
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,300
Oh.

529
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:11,320
[5:30 PM - One hour before going live]
[Music Bank Dressing Room]

530
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:15,880
[Cindy, 23 Years Old]
[Debuted 10 Years Ago]

531
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:20,779
Is the light working okay?
Isn't is kind of dark in here?

532
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:25,519
It's fine, but what are you doing
all the way here?

533
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,940
Oh, I was just wondering if Cindy
was comfortable with everything.

534
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:33,449
How's the chair?
It looks uncomfortable.

535
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:37,210
This chair's been here since I first
started working here in 1997.

536
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,790
It's time for a change, huh?

537
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:43,069
Oh no, it's really fine.

538
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:47,219
Um, it's really time for her to go
on live soon.

539
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:51,880
Oh yes, that's right!
Then, do a good job.

540
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:56,019
But, how are you for time?

541
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:59,079
I'm wondering if you could go and
say hello to the Chief.

542
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:05,119
That's nice of you to suggest,
but the time... and it's a live show...

543
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:08,779
Oh, is that so?
But, it'll just take five minutes.

544
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:11,369
Maybe it's too much.

545
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:15,919
She is in full make up and
her shoes are uncomfortable.

546
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,549
That's true. It would be too much to
go all the way there, right?

547
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:24,780
- I'm sorry.
- No, no. There's nothing you can do.

548
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:38,459
Then how's this?

549
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:42,639
It's too much to go,
so how about some pictures?

550
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,890
Huh?

551
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:47,069
Come in, over here.

552
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:50,419
This here is the Department Chief's
daughter, Jang Yae Rim.

553
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:53,109
Here, say hello and come
stand next to Cindy.

554
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:56,310
Hi, I'm a big fan. Take a picture.

555
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:01,099
One, two, three... just one more.

556
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:05,530
One, two, three... two, three.

557
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:13,580
One more.

558
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:17,819
What is this? She's so rude.

559
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:20,909
Hey, hey. Look at her expression.
Wow, amazing.

560
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:24,399
Would it kill her to take a picture?
Would her face wear down?

561
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,689
She's rude just like people said.

562
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:30,389
- What kind of attitude is this to fans?
- Really, how annoying.

563
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:32,829
Whose dressing room do you want
to visit next?

564
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:35,910
- EXO?
- Yes please! Yes!

565
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:42,350
This is why I said I didn't want
to do rehearsals.

566
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:47,320
Because I'm sitting in here,
all sorts of weird things happen.

567
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:51,150
Ask them to let me off for the
next dress rehearsal.

568
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:57,630
But, the main PD is extremely difficult.

569
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,650
And in your eyes...

570
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:07,119
am I not difficult?

571
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:11,420
Oh no, I do think you're
extremely difficult.

572
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,200
Have I wronged you in some way?

573
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,210
What?

574
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,669
That's not what I meant.

575
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:25,640
Well now, just be honest and
speak your mind.

576
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:31,480
What was I so extremely
difficult about?

577
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:34,509
- That's not what I meant.
- What do you mean, it's not...

578
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:35,870
I'm sorry.

579
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:43,570
What is it you're sorry for?

580
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:48,220
I'm asking because I'm truly curious.
What are you sorry about?

581
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,000
Cindy?

582
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:57,059
I think you're going to
have to change.

583
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:59,340
See-through isn't allowed.

584
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:05,449
Mr. Car-owner,
you must be very busy.

585
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:07,849
I didn't receive an answer,
so I'm texting you again.

586
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:10,519
Once you see this,
please contact me.

587
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,620
Have a lovely day.

588
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:24,650
Why isn't he reading it?
I'm sure this is the right number.

589
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:39,200
- Turn it off.
- I'm sorry.

590
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:44,400
Kids these days.

591
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:47,870
Hey, just because I use my phone,
do you think you can too?

592
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:01,089
The customer has turned off the phone.
You will be connected to voicemail.

593
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:03,870
Wow, he just completely
turned off his phone now.

594
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:07,079
This guy is no joke.

595
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:11,949
Ye Jin, about the outfit you
asked Cindy to change into...

596
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:13,960
Yeah, see-through is not allowed.
Why?

597
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:17,710
- She says she won't change into it.
- What?

598
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:21,069
Why?

599
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:23,339
She says it's the
concept for her new album.

600
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:27,869
Tell her manager to come in. No in fact,
tell her manager's boss to come in.

601
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:29,330
Okay.

602
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:34,569
Why can't she change her outfit?

603
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:38,129
It's our first comeback week and
it's the concept for her new album.

604
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:42,729
- If you can just...
- I told you it's too racy for KBS.

605
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:45,389
Why do I have to keep
repeating myself?

606
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:50,490
I understand, I'll see if I can
persuade her. Give me a moment.

607
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:58,789
You can get things done
more efficiently

608
00:42:58,790 --> 00:43:04,450
by communicating with the manager instead
of talking to the celebrity directly.

609
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:08,260
They're probably shocked since the
producer is personally getting involved.

610
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:12,350
Producer, you'll just have to
let Cindy wear it. I'm sorry.

611
00:43:20,310 --> 00:43:21,940
- Look...
- Hello?

612
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:25,160
Hello, Producer!

613
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:39,599
This won't do. I'm going
to have to talk her personally.

614
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:43,000
Producer Ye Jin!
Are you going to fight with her?

615
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:49,130
Fight? With who?
Me and Cindy?

616
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:54,870
How can I fight with her?
It's more like a scolding.

617
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:05,270
Holy cow!

618
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:13,400
- Manager.
- Yeah?

619
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:16,710
Can you step outside for a moment?

620
00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:22,050
The sound of your
breathing is a bit loud.

621
00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:28,390
Oh, sorry for breathing so loud.

622
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,540
Producer Ye Jin.

623
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:48,970
Ms. Cindy, I'm Tak Ye Jin.
The producer of Music Bank.

624
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:52,610
I clearly told you earlier that I
wanted you to change your outfit.

625
00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:55,369
I guess that's too
difficult for you to do.

626
00:44:55,370 --> 00:45:00,640
You must not have gotten the message.
I said I won't change my outfit.

627
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:06,549
The problem is not the message.
The problem is you're not allowed.

628
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:10,720
Racy outfits are not allowed
according to KBS policy.

629
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:15,490
This outfit is pretty, not racy.

630
00:45:18,310 --> 00:45:21,920
Excuse me, the guy with the
tear drop patterned necktie.

631
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:27,280
Don't you agree?

632
00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:34,890
- Don't you think this is pretty?
- Yes, it's pretty.

633
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:41,480
See?
He says it's pretty, Producer.

634
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:44,709
Men like it.

635
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:51,450
Women like you... who are slightly
old may not see it that way.

636
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:57,770
Even older women watch
Music Bank with their sons.

637
00:45:58,570 --> 00:46:01,170
They watch Music Bank
with their sons?

638
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:07,630
Have you ever watched Music Bank
with your mother at home?

639
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:11,900
I don't recall...

640
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:17,590
but I think I have, though.

641
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:22,949
I think it's the respectful
thing to do when the head producer

642
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:25,109
personally asks you
to change your outfit.

643
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:30,260
Is it necessary for you to give
everyone a hard time like this?

644
00:46:35,050 --> 00:46:36,860
Okay.

645
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:42,110
- Good. You understand now?
- Yes. I won't do this program.

646
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:46,050
What?

647
00:46:47,310 --> 00:46:51,700
It seems I'm a nuisance to
this program.

648
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:57,979
I'll just leave.
Manager, let's go.

649
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:01,630
- That's not what I meant!
- Then what did you mean?

650
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:08,180
Seriously, this won't do.

651
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,200
Everyone, get out.

652
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:14,769
- Producer Ye Jin...
- Get out!

653
00:47:14,770 --> 00:47:16,660
Sure.

654
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:31,690
Cindy... you really don't know
what the main problem is right now?

655
00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:38,209
What is it?

656
00:47:38,210 --> 00:47:42,269
It's KBS. The fact that it's a
live broadcast is the problem.

657
00:47:42,270 --> 00:47:47,399
I think this outfit is so pretty,
but the station won't allow it!

658
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:50,440
I am truly upset!

659
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:56,440
So... how do you know that
when I haven't been on stage?

660
00:47:57,390 --> 00:47:59,519
It's without a doubt 100 percent!
I guarantee it!

661
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:02,149
If you perform on stage
with this outfit right now...

662
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:06,179
- I'll have to answer to the board.
- So what the heck am I supposed to do?

663
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:10,130
I'm not asking you to do anything
out of the ordinary, so basically...

664
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:15,299
That outfit you have on is nice, but how
about you wear a jacket with it? Huh?

665
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:20,730
Showing a little skin instead of showing
everything is considered sexy. Huh?

666
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,000
Producer.

667
00:48:24,590 --> 00:48:27,709
- That is see-through.
- You're right!

668
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:32,539
That is see-through, but let's
cover it up just a tad bit more.

669
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:36,130
Don't you think it'll
be so much sexier? Huh?

670
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,679
Is there even a jacket for me to wear?

671
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:47,050
Oh my gosh, are you going to wear it?
You're going to wear a jacket for me?

672
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:50,440
Seriously, I'm so honored.

673
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:54,069
Now I know why you're
all the rage these days.

674
00:48:54,070 --> 00:48:56,110
You're such an understanding person.

675
00:48:56,650 --> 00:48:58,390
Thank you.

676
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:05,710
Bring her a jacket. She said
she'll record with extra top on.

677
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,349
Did you scold her a lot?

678
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:12,179
Don't go around spreading rumors
that Cindy got scolded by me.

679
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:15,220
She's not at a level to be
scolded by producers anymore.

680
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,420
Hey, slacker boy.

681
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:24,379
- Me?
- Yes, you.

682
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:26,340
What's your name?

683
00:49:27,390 --> 00:49:29,460
It's Baek Seung Chan.

684
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:33,659
Okay, Baek Seung Chan.
You must feel very sad right now.

685
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:35,759
Did Cindy look that pretty
in her see-through outfit?

686
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,419
Are you one of her groupies?
Are you stupid?

687
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:42,210
- I'm sorry.
- I told you not to say 'I'm sorry!'

688
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:45,799
I'm in a battlefield right now
trying to win a war!

689
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,639
And you're in a dugout eating cookies!

690
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:49,979
What a nice way to go.

691
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:53,150
If you have a mouth,
then go ahead and say something!

692
00:49:55,390 --> 00:49:58,729
If I try to apologize
whenever you reprimand me...

693
00:49:58,730 --> 00:50:00,629
I'm sorry.

694
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:02,269
I told you not to say 'I'm sorry.'

695
00:50:02,270 --> 00:50:04,520
You tell me not to say 'I'm sorry.'

696
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,409
If I stay still,
you ask me why I'm so quiet.

697
00:50:08,410 --> 00:50:10,049
If you have a mouth,
then go ahead and say something!

698
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:11,760
And you ask me if I have a mouth.

699
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:14,990
So I apologize once again.

700
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:18,220
However, I can't say I'm sorry.

701
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:25,430
The only thing left is to
shake hands.

702
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:30,490
[6:20 p.m. just minutes before
Music Bank is about to go live.]

703
00:50:31,150 --> 00:50:34,069
The '2 Days, 1 Night' team said they
were going to give us the final copy.

704
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:35,559
Why haven't we heard from them?

705
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:37,489
They're under fire right now.

706
00:50:37,490 --> 00:50:41,449
I saw Joon Mo go to the Chief's office
earlier, and I think he got an earful.

707
00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:43,840
And I heard he went to see
the board in the afternoon.

708
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:48,120
Okay, bring it over
whenever it's finalized.

709
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,489
Attention, rookies.

710
00:50:53,490 --> 00:50:55,300
As you probably know...

711
00:50:55,310 --> 00:51:00,229
there are many instances where other
programs ask Music Bank for casting favors.

712
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:05,560
We're pretty much the powerhouse
over the whole variety sector.

713
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:13,349
At times like this, helping each other
out is a win-win situation.

714
00:51:13,350 --> 00:51:18,759
Granted, you don't agree right away,
but only when the timing is right.

715
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:20,470
Okay? Watch.

716
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,829
[Joon Bal]

717
00:51:25,830 --> 00:51:27,289
What?

718
00:51:27,290 --> 00:51:30,599
It's about the favor you asked earlier.
About 'Miss A' for next week.

719
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,649
I'll pre-record it for you.

720
00:51:32,650 --> 00:51:34,700
Forget it. I don't need it.

721
00:51:36,810 --> 00:51:39,500
Hello? I didn't hear you.

722
00:51:40,510 --> 00:51:44,400
The reception here isn't very good,
so the calls get dropped frequently.

723
00:51:50,530 --> 00:51:53,730
[7 p.m. Music Bank Live Broadcast.]

724
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:58,519
She wore the jacket!

725
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:02,479
Let's use camera four for the first cut.

726
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:08,910
Zoom out on Cindy's face.
Music standby. Okay... cue.

727
00:52:17,550 --> 00:52:19,190
One, cut!

728
00:52:20,550 --> 00:52:22,350
Two, cut!

729
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:29,870
Wow!

730
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:34,980
It wasn't... it wasn't me...

731
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:38,639

739
00:53:04,430 --> 00:53:05,980
- Good job, everyone.
- Good job today.

740
00:53:06,690 --> 00:53:09,359
Tell Cindy's manager I
want to see him immediately.

741
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:11,729
There's another event, so they
left as soon as Cindy was done.

742
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:13,980
- Already?
- Yes.

743
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:22,869
Wow, they ran away because
they're so scared of me.

744
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:25,100
Right? That's what it is, right?
Oh my gosh.

745
00:53:28,270 --> 00:53:32,140
- Tell her CEO to stop by tomorrow.
- CEO Byun?

746
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:36,669
He's not the type to come
because you tell him to...

747
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:38,470
Of course he should come.
Why wouldn't he?

748
00:53:46,330 --> 00:53:47,770
You.

749
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:52,079
You must've been ecstatic to see
Cindy with her pretty clothes on.

750
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:56,270
Your reaction was pretty strong back there.
Are you part of the audience?

751
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:05,289
Sure! Hey... why don't you
be a part of the audience?

752
00:54:05,290 --> 00:54:08,169
You said Cindy's outfit
was pretty earlier.

753
00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:10,389
Go and and tell her exactly
what I said.

754
00:54:10,390 --> 00:54:13,190
That it was very pretty and
it wasn't even remotely racy!

755
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:38,200
It's your first day on the job.
How was it today?

756

How do you think it was today?

757
00:54:53,310 --> 00:54:55,869
Joon Mo, where are you?

758
00:54:55,870 --> 00:54:58,640
I have a gathering today
with my team members.

759
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:02,410
No, I'm going to be late today.

760
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,270
No, I'm going to be more late
than that.

761
00:55:06,030 --> 00:55:08,130
Yeah, I think I'm going to be tired.

762
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:14,160
Okay, bye.

763
00:55:14,830 --> 00:55:17,840
- Producer, hello.
- Hey.

764
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:21,299
- Hey.
- Yes?

765
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:23,530
Are you still working for CEO Byun?

766
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:27,069
- Yes.
- Who are you managing now?

767
00:55:27,070 --> 00:55:29,899
- Cindy.
- Really?

768
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:32,170
Yes.

769
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:45,109
Is that dinner?

770
00:55:45,110 --> 00:55:49,149
I already ate earlier.
This is for Cindy.

771
00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:51,790
We have to get to Suwon by
ten and we're short on time.

772
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:55,960
Put that down.

773
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:04,010
What's taking him so long?

774
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:13,740
Where is he going?

775
00:56:14,770 --> 00:56:19,029
Ma'am, I'd like a maechu kimbap, beef
kimbap, and a fish cake soup to go.

776
00:56:19,030 --> 00:56:21,830
- Okay.
- Producer...

777
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:27,169
You... go and relay
this message to CEO Byun.

778
00:56:27,170 --> 00:56:31,500
Tell her to at least feed her kids
if she's going to work them to death.

779
00:56:32,110 --> 00:56:37,279
She should at least feed her if
she's going to work her like a slave!

780
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:41,189
Tell her to dance and sing all day!

781
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:45,630
I swear, that life-sucking leech!
That Byun-pire!

782
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:54,599
Are you kidding me?

783
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:56,909
Don't you know that I
don't eat carbohydrates?

784
00:56:56,910 --> 00:56:58,500
Plus...

785
00:56:59,150 --> 00:57:01,630
are you telling me to
eat this salty soup?

786
00:57:02,270 --> 00:57:05,719
Do you want me to dance
with a swollen face?

787
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:09,320
What was I supposed to do? The producer
insisted that I feed this to you.

788
00:57:09,330 --> 00:57:10,929
Who is he again?

789
00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:13,650
He's the producer for
'2 Days 1 Night.'

790
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:16,879
Is he my fan?

791
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,660
I don't think so.

792
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:24,680
I think he's mortal enemies
with CEO Byun.

793
00:57:25,930 --> 00:57:27,469
Why?

794
00:57:27,470 --> 00:57:29,040
That I don't know.

795
00:57:29,970 --> 00:57:33,000
Our CEO naturally has a lot
of enemies.

796
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,859
You call yourself writers?

797
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:43,279
You call yourself a producer?

798
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:46,359
Release the suspension.

799
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:51,340
I'm going to sleep here if you don't
release the suspension for my kids.

800
00:57:55,400 --> 00:58:00,140
But... if he's mortal
enemies with CEO Byun...

801
00:58:01,090 --> 00:58:02,890
why would he give me this?

802
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:06,370
I don't know.

803
00:58:09,470 --> 00:58:11,260
Is he a psycho?

804
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:17,600
[9 p.m. closing time. KBS parking lot.]

Come on, why aren't you
picking up your phone?

806
00:58:34,630 --> 00:58:38,200
- Hello?
- Ah, you answered your phone!

807
00:58:38,210 --> 00:58:43,049
Sir, I'm not sure if you
got my text message or not.

808
00:58:43,050 --> 00:58:47,729
There was a slight accident to your car
while I was going to work this morning.

809
00:58:47,730 --> 00:58:51,279
Where are you right now?

810
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:54,499
Ah yes, I'm almost at the parking lot.

811
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:56,879
I see.

812
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:01,300
By any chance,
are you a KBS employee?

813
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:03,650
Yes, I am.

814
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:08,710
My word! Then we're
part of the same family!

815

Which department do you work for?

816
00:59:12,890 --> 00:59:16,159
- I work in variety show department.
- The variety show department?

817
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,240
The variety...

818
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:29,680
No way...

819
00:59:38,390 --> 00:59:40,840
You have a nice car.

820
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,550
It's my father's car.

821
00:59:47,070 --> 00:59:48,680
Is that so?

822
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:54,710
Why didn't you respond
to my text message?

823
00:59:56,430 --> 00:59:59,949
You told me not to
look at my cell phone.

824
00:59:59,950 --> 01:00:03,679
You're right, I did.
Good job.

825
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:06,469
Ah, there's one more
message I didn't check.

826
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:08,030
Don't do it!

827
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:11,820
Come here and take a look at this.
I just scratched it slightly.

828
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:14,380
Okay.

829
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:19,320
It's not exactly a slight scratch...

830
01:00:21,010 --> 01:00:23,479
Don't thing about going easy on
me because I'm you're superior.

831
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:25,370
I'm not that type of person, okay?

832
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:29,510
Yes, ma'am.

833
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:33,930
Okay then, I understand.

834
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:37,060
You understand?

835
01:00:37,790 --> 01:00:43,569
Yes, I can't make a decision on my
own since this is my father's car.

836
01:00:43,570 --> 01:00:48,950
I'll give you a call after I
discuss it with my father first.

837
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:53,549
Of course you should.
You're right.

838
01:00:53,550 --> 01:00:58,630
Yes, well then... good night, ma'am.

839
01:00:59,350 --> 01:01:02,060
You go. I'll go whenever I'm ready.

840
01:01:02,610 --> 01:01:04,820
I insist you go first, Senior.

841
01:01:13,570 --> 01:01:16,019
Look at this right here!

01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:19,860
How am I supposed to get in? Huh?

843
01:01:19,870 --> 01:01:23,449
How can I not scratch your car?
Seriously!

844
01:01:23,450 --> 01:01:27,580
- Then should I take my car out first?
- Forget it! I'm already inside!

845
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:32,330
Look at this! Look how you parked
your car so closely next to mine!

846
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:44,829
What about Writer Choi?

847
01:01:44,830 --> 01:01:47,689
I called and he's crossing
the Mapo bridge right now.

848
01:01:47,690 --> 01:01:50,890
Does he live in that area?
He's always crossing...

849
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:54,010
Or at least change the name
of the bridge or something.

But, why are you buying us hanwoo?

852
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:03,420
How strange.

853
01:02:03,430 --> 01:02:05,419
Is our program getting canned?

854
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:07,389
No.

855
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:10,799
- What happened to 'Miss A?'
- Forget it. We don't have to do it.

856
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:13,829
What the heck?
I found the location and everything.

857
01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:17,180
Please don't make me work twice.
I'm so freaking tired.

858
01:02:18,370 --> 01:02:22,210
- It's true. We're getting canned.
- That's not true!

859
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:33,940
The program is not getting dropped,
but the members need to be replaced.

860
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:43,049
It's better this way! The ratings
are low and we can't find an answer.

861
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:45,219
We need to gather highlights
for the show next week

862
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:47,179
so let's meet up later.

863
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:50,520
- Do it on your own.
- What do you mean? It's our business.

864
01:02:50,530 --> 01:02:53,489
Exactly, it's our business and our show.

865
01:02:53,490 --> 01:02:56,169
What about us?
Are we sure we're not getting fired?

866
01:02:56,170 --> 01:02:57,919
That's the important part.

867
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:00,269
You think this is our
first time having a meeting

868
01:03:00,270 --> 01:03:01,869
without knowing that
we're getting fired?

869
01:03:01,870 --> 01:03:04,789
- Who says you guys are getting fired?
- How are we supposed to believe that?

870
01:03:04,790 --> 01:03:09,989
You didn't tell us until the very end
when 'Sponge' got canned last time.

871
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:14,319
That's why I took all the
'Sponge' writers with me!

872
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:18,059
There were 12 'Sponge'
writers back then!

873
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:21,119
The problem was, there was
no need for all those writers!

874
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:23,269
That's the type of person I am.

875
01:03:23,270 --> 01:03:27,489
The level is different even if
another program got canned like us.

876
01:03:27,490 --> 01:03:31,169
The producers get the same pay
whether there is a program or not.

877
01:03:31,170 --> 01:03:33,950
This is where you see the difference.

878
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:42,289
I'm sorry, but what's going
to happen with our manuscript?

879
01:03:42,290 --> 01:03:44,999
What's the percentage when
the highlight episode goes out?

880
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,369
Wait a minute.

881
01:03:46,370 --> 01:03:50,379
Then do we have to find the
materials for the highlight next week?

882
01:03:50,380 --> 01:03:51,740
Is that the problem right now?

883
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:54,169
It is a problem.
That means more work for us.

884
01:03:54,170 --> 01:03:56,329
Someone might think that
you're doing all the work here.

885
01:03:56,330 --> 01:04:00,079
Producer, I'm sorry but I have
a lecture for grad school today.

886
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:02,190
If you're done talking...

887
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:05,410
I'm going to head out firsts.

Oh my gosh... what are we going to do
about the fashion section next week?

891
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:17,179
We have to cancel it.

01:07:55,110 --> 01:07:57,569
What for?
Let's just blow out the candle.

911
01:07:57,570 --> 01:07:58,969
What are you talking about?

912
01:07:58,970 --> 01:08:02,329
Our Seung Chan got hired to work at
KBS. The best sight-seeing station...

913
01:08:02,330 --> 01:08:04,229
It's a public broadcasting
station, father.

914
01:08:04,230 --> 01:08:06,670
In our country.
This is a big deal.

915
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:10,929
We need to pray all together
and give thanks to the lord.

916
01:08:10,930 --> 01:08:13,899
You're right, father.
Congratulation, Seung Chan.

917
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:18,110
But what made you think of
becoming a producer all of a sudden?

918
01:08:19,670 --> 01:08:23,569
No kidding. I'm not sure
why I wanted to become one.

919
01:08:23,570 --> 01:08:27,159
Seung Chan, you're a 'Music Bank'
producer now, right?

920
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:29,579
All my friends are so excited!

921
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:32,989
Will we be able to see the
GOT7 members up close now?

922
01:08:32,990 --> 01:08:36,200
Goodness, let's hurry up and pray!
The candle is melting!

923
01:08:36,210 --> 01:08:37,570
Sure.

924
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:40,840
Heavenly father...

925
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:45,689
our Seung Chan got hired to work at
KBS. The best sight-seeing station...

926
01:08:45,690 --> 01:08:48,500
It's a public broadcasting
station, father.

927
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:52,219
In any case, he got
hired to work at KBS.

928
01:08:52,220 --> 01:08:54,799
It's a huge honor, Lord!

929
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:59,520
We pray that he does
your work inside KBS.

930
01:09:00,610 --> 01:09:04,760
Also... our eldest son,
Young Chan...

931
01:09:07,460 --> 01:09:10,469
He is studying hard for the
upcoming civil servant exam in 2017.

932
01:09:10,470 --> 01:09:15,069
Granted, this will be his twelfth year.

933
01:09:15,070 --> 01:09:17,909
Please give him the strength
and will to do well this time!

934
01:09:17,910 --> 01:09:19,159
Father!

935
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:21,859
His wife couldn't make it because
of the constant fights they have...

936
01:09:21,860 --> 01:09:24,249
She couldn't come because
she's not feeling well, father.

937
01:09:24,250 --> 01:09:26,849
She's got a variety of
excuses, doesn't she?

938
01:09:26,850 --> 01:09:31,130
You don't know what it's like.
She got a huge sore.

939
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:34,919
- It's true, mom.
- Please watch over her health.

940
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:38,219
- And our eldest daughter...
- Just skip over me, please.

941
01:09:38,220 --> 01:09:40,570
As she requested,
we'll skip over her.

942
01:09:41,650 --> 01:09:48,199
Our son-in-law is the
best urologist in Korea.

943
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:51,009
For the sake of all men's health in
this country, the gift you blessed him...

944
01:09:51,010 --> 01:09:53,199
- Dad!
- Amen.

945
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:57,349
- We pray all of this in the name of...
- Why do you always forget about me?

946
01:09:57,350 --> 01:09:59,590
Why did you give birth to me
if you're going to do this?

947
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:06,980
- Our savior, Jesus Christ.
- Amen.

948
01:10:08,390 --> 01:10:10,160
Blow out the candle!

949
01:10:13,300 --> 01:10:15,180
All right!

950
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:21,939
Anyway, I am very happy today.

951
01:10:21,940 --> 01:10:26,030
Our son-in-law is a doctor.
Our eldest son is a...

952
01:10:27,820 --> 01:10:30,830
will become a judge as soon
as he passes his civil servant exam.

953
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:33,860
And now our Seung Chan.

954
01:10:34,570 --> 01:10:37,079
Our family has so many people
with such prestigious jobs.

955
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:39,920
Why does it count as prestigious?

956
01:10:42,070 --> 01:10:45,279
Producer.

957
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:49,500
Am I wrong?
Producer!

958
01:10:51,690 --> 01:10:53,450
Producer!

959
01:10:55,390 --> 01:11:03,390
Subtitles by DramaFever

960
01:11:23,270 --> 01:11:26,839
I'm the one who picked her!
How can I personally tell her to quit?

961
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:30,049
Who is going to understand you if
you do it that way? Are you a dolphin?

962
01:11:30,050 --> 01:11:31,919
Are you trying to communicate
with an ultrasound?

963
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:34,099
Then who the heck is
supposed to tell her?

964
01:11:34,100 --> 01:11:36,760
- Tell me what?
- Hello!

965
01:11:39,730 --> 01:11:42,480
Fine, I won't look! I won't look!

966
01:11:42,490 --> 01:11:44,689
Me? In what way am I scary?

967
01:11:44,690 --> 01:11:48,389
Don't worry! I told you I'm
going to work much harder.

968
01:11:48,390 --> 01:11:52,819
I heard you made a mess today. Do you
know you can get fired even as a rookie?

969
01:11:52,820 --> 01:11:54,539
Excuse me?

970
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:58,270
You have two strikes left. Be careful.

971
01:11:59,930 --> 01:12:01,239
Use this.

972
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:05,449
This umbrella doesn't belong to me.
I just borrowed it from the lobby desk.

973
01:12:05,450 --> 01:12:06,519
Pardon?

974
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:09,729
They're going to take it out of my
paycheck if I don't return the umbrella.

975
01:12:09,730 --> 01:12:12,179
- Please return it under my name.
- Sure.

976
01:12:12,180 --> 01:12:15,020
I'm Producer Baek Seung Chan
of '2 Days, 1 Night.'
