1
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,889
I got it.

2
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,405
I'm going back to the limo.

3
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,162
- Natalie.
- Nice to see you.

4
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,403
Pardon my incredulity, Natalie,

5
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,210
but I'm very surprised
to see you here.

6
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,203
Pleasantly so, of course.

7
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,204
I'm a little surprised to see
myself here, too, Mary Alice.

8
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,362
Pleasantly so, of course.

9
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,040
Were you here last year?

10
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,362
No, I wasn't invited last year.

11
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,801
Oh. Curious.

12
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,928
That must have been an accident.

13
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,650
Oh, do you know Libby?

14
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,484
No, I don't believe I do.

15
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,483
Libby, this is Natalie Standish.

16
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,086
Natalie is Reed's...

17
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,322
oh, is it all right to, uh...

18
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,127
Say that Reed got me pregnant
when I was a barhop

19
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,726
at your country club,
married me to avoid scandal,

20
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,763
spent the next 10 years
sucking the life out of me,

21
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,685
got bored with me, dumped me
and screwed me in court?

22
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,330
Sure. Go ahead.

23
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,410
Natalie is Reed's ex-wife.

24
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,251
Oh. Libby Percy Holt.

25
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,091
Natalie Warjecheski Standish.

26
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,009
Well, are you
unescorted tonight?

27
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,889
No, I'm with someone,

28
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,042
a friend, male.

29
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:04,928
Well, if the new fella comes by,
be sure and point him out to us.

30
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,724
Oh, I don't think
I'll have to do that.

31
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,325
You'll know him
when you see him.

32
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,003
Oh, great. Come on.

33
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,802
Get out of here.

34
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,686
Feisty little guy.

35
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,683
I don't care for caviar.
I make it a rule

36
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,127
never to eat anything
a fish deposits in a riverbed.

37
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,084
Right?

38
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,240
It's been awfully nice
meeting you...

39
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,482
- Dutch.
- Indeed.

40
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,284
Nice meeting you.

41
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,131
- Hi.
- How are you?

42
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,805
I missed you.

43
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,366
Hello, Natalie.

44
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,807
Reed Standish.

45
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,486
Dutch Dooley.

46
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,211
You look great.

47
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,850
I didn't expect to see you here.

48
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,565
I didn't expect
to see you either.

49
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,404
I thought you were going down
to spend some time with Doyle.

50
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,164
Something came up.

51
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,651
I have to go to London
in the morning.

52
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,325
How does Doyle feel about that?

53
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,642
Haven't been able
to reach him yet.

54
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,002
Well, you'll be talking to him.
You can tell him.

55
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,924
You haven't told him
you're not coming?

56
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,722
I'm sorry. Could you excuse us?

57
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,530
This is personal.

58
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,965
Where the hell
did you find him?

59
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,485
Look, you can call Doyle, okay?

60
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,802
I'm tired of doing
the dirty work for you.

61
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,803
I'm being very nice to you.

62
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,327
I gave you a house to live in
with your truck driver.

63
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,289
- He's not a truck driver.
- Don't interrupt.

64
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,204
You get a monthly check,
a house to live in,

65
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,442
and you get joint custody
of Doyle.

66
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,002
You give me a hard time,
you'll lose it all.

67
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,685
You wouldn't dare play fair,
would you?

68
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,167
I wouldn't dare lose.

69
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,443
Have a nice holiday.

70
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,121
Excuse me.

71
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,123
I know that what you were saying
to Natalie was personal.

72
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,601
I understand.
I'm involved with her now,

73
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,967
so this is personal, too.

74
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,487
You hurt her, and I'll hit you
so fucking hard,

75
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,608
your dog'll bleed, okay?

76
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,765
Nice meeting you.

77
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,370
I just feel weak and used.

78
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:50,969
He took you out of your life,
put you in his and took off.

79
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,240
I mean, you don't need him

80
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,846
or his house or his money
or his friends.

81
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,923
Make it on your own.

82
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,529
There's only one thing he has
that I want.

83
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,841
Well, what the heck would you do

84
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,764
with a set of tiny
little genitals?

85
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,287
- I'm being serious.
- I'm sorry.

86
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,203
He has my son.

87
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,890
Hello.

88
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,042
I'd like to speak
to Doyle Standish, please.

89
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,362
Oh.

90
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,648
Yeah. Hold on.

91
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,921
Doyle.

92
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,642
Doyle.

93
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:19,043
- Do you know how to knock?
- Your ma's on the phone.

94
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,282
Do you know how to knock?

95
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,209
The door was open.

96
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,489
It wasn't open.
It was unlocked.

97
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,047
Someone from any sort of decent
background would knock.

98
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,244
And she's not my "ma."

99
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,051
I don't have a "ma."

100
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,608
You may have a "ma."

101
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,127
I have a mother, okay?

102
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,123
Do you wanna take
the call, shithead?

103
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,049
I could have you written up
for profanity.

104
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,043
Yeah? I'm terrified.

105
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,888
I will have you written up.

106
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,123
Working in the kitchen
will be good for you, Teddy.

107
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,203
You can have a taste
of what your career

108
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,964
at Burger King will be like.

109
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,971
What makes you think
you're so superior?

110
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,361
I don't have to think.

111
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,522
It's sickening how much
you love yourself.

112
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,881
Yeah.

113
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,847
I guess it would be
to someone who's enrolled here

114
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,486
only because his father
is an employee.

115
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,808
At least I have a father.

116
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,641
- Yes?
- Doyle?

117
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,961
Hi, sweetheart.

118
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,361
What do you want?

119
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,330
I'm calling about Thanksgiving.

120
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,005
What about it?

121
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,804
I'd like you to come home.

122
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,806
For the umpteenth time,
I'll be with Dad.

123
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,042
Dad can't be with you, honey.

124
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,043
He has to go to Europe.

125
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,407
Um, he told me last night.

126
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,483
So if he's made
any plans with you,

127
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,642
obviously he'll have
to break them.

128
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,366
I... I really want you
to come home, Doyle.

129
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,370
So you can get my approval
of your new boyfriend?

130
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,800
To appease your guilt?

131
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,167
Look, you are old enough
to be objective

132
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,488
about me and your father
and to understand

133
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,449
why we're in
the situation we're in.

134
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,444
Yeah, I know. I understand.

135
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,807
You couldn't make it work.

136
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:45,521
If you could see both sides,
you'd know that that isn't true.

137
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,523
I love you, honey, and...

138
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,284
and I want you home.

139
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,522
I... I've booked you
a flight on Wednesday,

140
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,011
and I expect you to be on it.

141
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,482
Forget it! I'm not coming home
to spend a holiday with you

142
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,688
or the idiot you're sharing
the house with, okay?

143
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,524
He is not sharing
the house with me,

144
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,051
and he is hardly an idiot.

145
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,605
I love you, sweetheart.

146
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,122
Little trouble
on the home front?

147
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,082
- Aww.
- What a jerk.

148
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,009
You talk to your son yet?

149
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,322
Mm-hmm.

150
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,641
And?

151
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,081
I don't know.
I have a ticket for him.

152
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,924
I know he won't use it.

153
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,450
Do you want to go down
and get him?

154
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,847
He won't appreciate that.

155
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,525
How about if I go down?

156
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,048
There's no better way
for two guys

157
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,090
to get to know each other than to
spend a couple of days in a car.

158
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:50,284
Dutch, he doesn't
want to know you.

159
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,046
Well, from what I can gather,

160
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,762
all he wants to do is sit alone
in a room and hate people.

161
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:01,009
There's a fair amount
of truth in that.

162
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,003
Let me go down and get him.

163
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,811
I'm an interested third party.

164
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,042
I'm a communicator.

165
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,124
I'm a breakthrough kind of guy.

166
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,647
You know, I've handled some
pretty tough birds in my time.

167
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,683
And when the smoke cleared,
almost without exception...

168
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,765
I had a new friend.

169
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,169
Smells good.

170
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,448
I want to do this for you.
It's important.

171
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,570
If we're gonna be together
from now on,

172
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,087
I'm gonna have to have
a good relationship with Darren.

173
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,042
Doyle.

174
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,443
Doyle.

175
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,566
What do you want?

176
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,247
My parents wanted to know if,
since you're not going home,

177
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,004
you'd wanna come over
to our house for Thanksgiving.

178
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,164
Don't think I could handle
that much fun.

179
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,448
Is that a no?

180
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,171
That's a no.

181
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,926
Great. Have a nice weekend

182
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,447
rotting in your own
pissed-off world.

183
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,002
Peggy, it's me. I'm at O'Hare.

184
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,645
Listen, I'm flying
down to Atlanta

185
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,564
to pick up my girlfriend's kid
from school.

186
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,370
Yeah, it came up unexpectedly.

187
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,284
Tell Tug and Fritz
I'll be incommunicado,

188
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,044
they should take care
of anything that comes up.

189
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,531
I'll be back on Monday.

190
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,321
Listen, lady,
don't jerk me around, okay?

191
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,927
I have a letter from him saying
that he's going to pick me up.

192
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,287
Now give me
his number in London.

193
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,690
When my father finds out

194
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:16,322
that you refused to give me
his number, you're fired.

195
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,403
Yo.

196
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,680
Doyle!

197
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,763
Doyle?

198
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,404
Christ!

199
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,961
Dad!

200
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,368
Doyle?

201
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,444
Ohh!

202
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,568
Damn! Jeez. Ahh.

203
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,005
Ow!

204
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,041
Stand up.

205
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,202
What the hell?

206
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,966
I said, "Stand up"!

207
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,804
Hands over your head.

208
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,210
I don't think
you know who I am.

209
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,204
Ohh! Son of a...

210
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,210
Ow!

211
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,362
Give me the gun!

212
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,962
Give me the gun! Ahh!

213
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,442
No, you don't.

214
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,485
Sit.

215
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,369
I'm Dutch Dooley.

216
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,488
I'm a friend of your mother's.

217
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,483
I know she called you.

218
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,166
What the hell are you
beating me up for?

219
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,526
I feel the pain in my crotch
in my teeth.

220
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,200
Does campus security
know you're here?

221
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,928
Can you say, "I'm sorry
I hit you with a golf club,

222
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,686
kicked your face,
mashed your testes,

223
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,444
shot you twice"?

224
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,443
If that's too much,
a simple hello would do.

225
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,011
Answer my question.

226
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,491
You can't say that?

227
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,642
Of course I can say it.

228
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,808
I choose not to.

229
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,210
- Now can you?
- No.

230
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,408
Well, I have to shoot you.

231
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,722
Now, since we might be
legally related someday,

232
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,451
I'm gonna give you the option
of taking it on the backside.

233
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,722
Won't hurt as bad.

234
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,965
If you shoot me,
I'll have you arrested.

235
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,567
Well, I'll have to make it
look like an accident, then.

236
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,010
All right, you win.

237
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,561
Clearly. Now leave.

238
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,643
I told your mother I'd take you
home for the holidays.

239
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,928
I have plans.

240
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,329
Stay here? You gonna watch
the football game,

241
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,086
make a turkey sandwich
and hang yourself in the toilet?

242
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,483
I said I have plans.
Leave it at that. Now please go.

243
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,324
Waiting for your dad?

244
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,482
I don't have
to tell you anything.

245
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,005
He's not coming.

246
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,685
You don't know my dad,
so shut up.

247
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,205
I know he's in London.

248
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,925
Is that a fact?

249
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,888
We have a very big problem here.

250
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,810
I suppose we do.

251
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,330
I have a problem because
I said I'd pick you up.

252
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,204
And you have a problem because
the last guy that punched me

253
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,249
has a dent in his forehead

254
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,767
about the size
of my pinkie ring...

255
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,044
and he dribbles when he smiles.

256
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,611
Grab your stuff.

257
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,722
Listen one last time.

258
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,884
I'm not going anywhere
with you!

259
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,207
What do you like to do for fun?

260
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,443
Oh, you like to wiggle
and grunt. Me, too.

261
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,451
I like the back roads.

262
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,365
You know, the only thing you see
on the interstate is concrete.

263
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,202
You warm enough back there?

264
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:52,040
You know, I owe you an apology.

265
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,484
I lost my temper,
and I shouldn't have.

266
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,011
I was a little crazy.

267
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,844
I wasn't thinking
too clear, so...

268
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,802
I'm not 100% sure
those undershorts

269
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,088
I jammed in your mouth to shut
you up were clean or not.

270
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,369
Stop the car.

271
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,931
I don't think
that's a good idea.

272
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,923
This is only a two-lane.
That's a soft shoulder.

273
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,327
I said, "Stop the car."

274
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,847
You can't beat a Ford
for good brakes.

275
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,082
I'm gonna have you
prosecuted for this.

276
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,891
What, you mean like
in big people's court

277
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:46,328
or some school teen court
where if I'm found guilty,

278
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,608
I gotta roll naked in the snow

279
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,207
or make a bed with my teeth?

280
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:56,251
My father is one of the most
powerful men in the country.

281
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,323
When he hears
what you did to me,

282
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,006
he'll sue your working-class ass

283
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,606
into complete
and total destitution.

284
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,042
How you do you know
I'm working class?

285
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,922
From your cheap shoes
to your ridiculous hairstyle

286
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,129
to your crude vocabulary

287
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,362
to my mother's taste in men.

288
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,771
You scream it.

289
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,002
Huh. All right.

290
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,248
Is working class bad?

291
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,888
If you want to get into

292
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,082
a political discussion,
I'll shred you.

293
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,040
No, it's not bad.

294
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,171
Solid economy
needs hand workers.

295
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,607
Well, I used to drive
a cement truck.

296
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,802
My father was a bricklayer.

297
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,090
My mother used to work
in the laundry

298
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,925
at the Ponchartrain Hotel
in Detroit.

299
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,811
You must be very proud.

300
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,886
I am.

301
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,923
I still owe you
that shot in the ass.

302
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,525
You want to get it over with,

303
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,364
in case it's gnawing
on your mind?

304
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,763
You know, you might be
the toughest little whacker

305
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,365
in the junior high,
but in my world,

306
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,887
you're about as worrisome
as a cloudy day.

307
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,888
You got anything to say?

308
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,249
Me, I like to talk.

309
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,085
I love to talk, live to talk.

310
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,044
You got any amusing anecdotes?

311
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,922
I'm living through one
right now.

312
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,809
There's some truth there.

313
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,251
Yeah, this is a trip
we won't soon forget, huh?

314
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,969
You can count on it.

315
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,042
These are
the Cumberland Mountains.

316
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,324
Beautiful, aren't they?

317
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,643
You know what?

318
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,531
The more you babble,
the more you reveal yourself

319
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,081
as an insecure fool
who's deathly afraid

320
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,049
he's gonna blow his chance
at my mother.

321
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,611
What chance, Duncan?

322
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,888
My name's Doyle.

323
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:52,084
And the chance I'm referring to
has dollar signs in front of it.

324
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,605
A chance at your mom's money?

325
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,764
Bingo.

326
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,968
I may not look like I could
finance a trip to the zoo,

327
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,964
but the truth is I make
a pretty good living.

328
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,963
My income's a damn sight more

329
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,248
than your father
gives your mother to live on.

330
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,041
Oh, yeah, but my money doesn't
count in your neighborhood,

331
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,282
because I worked for it.

332
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,245
Working for your money

333
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,880
doesn't matter
in your part of the world.

334
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:26,080
It's whose crotch the doctor
yanked you out of, huh?

335
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,890
You're disgusting.

336
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,123
Fill it up, please,
unleaded, regular.

337
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,481
Mm-hmm.

338
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,083
We're gonna have some fun now.

339
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,965
You like fireworks?

340
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,363
Is that a yes, a no, a maybe?

341
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,443
Your testicles descending?
What?

342
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,807
Fireworks are illegal
in Illinois.

343
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,604
Yes, they are,
but this is Tennessee,

344
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,091
so it doesn't matter.

345
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,250
You're gonna detonate
this material now?

346
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,129
No, not here in the gas station.

347
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,681
Are you nuts?
Go down the road a piece.

348
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:52,322
I got M-80s.
I got dragon tongues.

349
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,563
I got, uh...

350
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,961
I don't even know what this is.

351
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:01,010
I got Jersey stinkers,
Bombay bugles,

352
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,924
and, for later,

353
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,323
I got a bag of pretzels, and

354
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,881
I got a deck

355
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,520
of racy playing cards.

356
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,250
Huh?

357
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,241
You know what?

358
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,609
You're like a great big,
demented child.

359
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,685
Ah, that was fun.

360
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,725
Can't beat
a good fireworks show.

361
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,131
Well, I guess you wanna eat.

362
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,130
Earl, we need
two orders of fries.

363
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,601
Coming right up.

364
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,931
Put it down here.

365
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,451
Thank you, darling.

366
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,927
Okay, sugar, what'll it be?

367
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,400
What won't make me vomit?

368
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,970
I know you're lying.

369
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,690
No, we're getting along great.

370
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,683
Ah, a few problems.

371
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,604
Nah, nothing serious.

372
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,725
Smoke bother you?

373
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,601
Yes.

374
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,487
You're asking for it so bad.

375
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,450
I'm not kidding.

376
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,364
You have no idea
how serious I can get

377
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,806
when I want to let somebody
have it.

378
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,809
Mmm.

379
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,322
You know, you might be able
to do some damage

380
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:30,280
to the small and exclusive group
of people that care about you...

381
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:37,049
but I don't think you could
raise a welt on my fanny.

382
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,801
Because, frankly, I don't care

383
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,850
if you live, die, or grow
mushrooms in your crack.

384
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,208
Get you so bad.

385
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,845
I don't think so.

386
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,570
You wanna put some money on it?

387
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,051
- How much?
- $5,000.

388
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,049
$5,000.

389
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,969
I bet you got it, too, huh,

390
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,322
in a little gilded box
under your bed.

391
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:05,010
Keep it modest. 20 bucks.

392
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,521
It's a bet.

393
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,008
Hey! Aah!

394
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,367
Ow!

395
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:20,166
God damn it. Aah!

396
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,090
Bitch! Bastard!
You little son of a bitch!

397
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,244
Go to hell!

398
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,886
I won the bet!

399
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,684
Yaah!

400
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,410
Throw one more...

401
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,846
throw one more,
and I'm leaving you.

402
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,365
Promise?

403
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,807
Guaranteed.

404
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,849
Good riddance!

405
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:26,081
Here. I'll see you at the motel
about 50 miles down the road.

406
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:38,167
Wait a minute! Stop!

407
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,163
I'll die!

408
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:36,371
Hello. Hello.

409
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,325
Hello.

410
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,603
Shit.

411
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,041
You wanna close the door?

412
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,328
I could have frozen to death,
you asshole.

413
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:14,165
I don't think you would
have frozen, not solid, anyway.

414
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,731
It's not quite cold enough
for that.

415
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,687
Here's something you should
know about me, Dale.

416
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,763
I don't screw around.

417
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,321
You piss me off, I react.

418
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,602
I'm not your dad.
I'm not your grampy.

419
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:38,765
I'm not your uncle.
I'm a working-class nobody,

420
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:41,969
and I don't take crap
from kiddies.

421
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:50,480
Where's my bag?

422
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,568
Oh, I didn't bother
to bring it in.

423
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,722
I figured you for dead.

424
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:59,326
Give me the keys.

425
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,326
Lock up when you're through.

426
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:24,771
- Doyle!
- Whoa!

427
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:28,367
Doyle! Just what the hell
are you doing?!

428
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,165
Get back here!

429
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,771
Damn it.

430
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,089
Goddamn...

431
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,207
Doyle.

432
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,570
Doyle!

433
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:35,851
Doyle.

434
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,321
Doyle!

435
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,569
I never saw a thing!

436
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,609
It came from out of nowhere!

437
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,762
Doyle!

438
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:07,409
Doyle.

439
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:18,361
I think this makes us even.

440
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,925
You're a lucky man
you're not hurt.

441
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:52,844
Thanks.

442
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,766
Hey, thanks for going along
with my story.

443
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:58,001
I really appreciate it.

444
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,128
The kid's got
emotional problems,

445
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:02,282
and the last thing he needs
is police trouble.

446
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:08,721
Take this.

447
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,565
Put it towards any repairs
you might have and your time.

448
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:13,722
If it's not enough, call me.

449
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:16,531
My number's on the card, okay?

450
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:19,809
Thanks. I appreciate it.

451
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:22,681
If it wasn't for your daddy,

452
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:26,083
I'd have busted every bone
in your body.

453
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:40,250
Show's over. Go home.

454
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,084
Go home.

455
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:49,885
Listen, you little son of a bitch.

456
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:52,042
You could have killed somebody
with a stunt like that.

457
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,322
That poor bastard was on his way
home to see his family,

458
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,165
and because you wanna play some
kind of a spoiled-brat prank,

459
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:58,924
you put his life in jeopardy.

460
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:01,248
Now, what gives you
the right to do that, huh?

461
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:04,203
I guess
I didn't think about that.

462
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:06,169
Well, you better start thinking
about a little something else

463
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:07,651
besides your own spoiled ass.

464
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:09,569
I took on
this idiotic assignment

465
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:11,085
because I love your mother.

466
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:13,129
I gotta wonder how nuts I am.

467
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,089
Man, I've met some scum
in my life,

468
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,686
but you beat all, man.
You are absolutely worthless.

469
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:20,047
You know what?
This isn't a joke anymore.

470
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:22,248
This is a full-blown mission.
You're not gonna beat me.

471
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,971
I've had my head split open,
my nose mashed.

472
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:26,963
I've been kicked and beat
and left for dead,

473
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:29,521
and when I set you down
on your mama's doorstep,

474
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:32,081
you're gonna be
one whipped little puppy.

475
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:41,327
Don't flatter yourself.

476
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:44,207
Get your hands down.

477
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:46,203
I'm not taking
any more of your crap.

478
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,727
You touch me once more,
you'll be sorry.

479
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,843
You wanna go, is that it?
You want me to go?

480
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,286
Hell, I'd love to go.
You wanna go?

481
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:54,442
- Yeah.
- Okay, fine.

482
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:57,001
Let's see if your punch
is as big as your mouth.

483
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,845
Only, this time,
no sissy kicks, okay,

484
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,082
no geometry,
no kamikaze tricks,

485
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,322
no sucker punches,

486
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:06,329
just good, all-American
street fighting.

487
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:08,488
Let me show you
how to do it, all right?

488
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,290
Here.
Give me your little digits.

489
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,881
Here. That's it.
Curl your little digits,

490
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:16,283
and you wad those up in little,
bitty balls like that.

491
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:17,885
Watch your little thumbies.

492
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,769
Put your thumbies out here
so you don't break 'em.

493
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:20,921
Get loose. That's it.

494
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:22,610
Bend your little knees.
That's it.

495
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:25,809
Okay, let me see you
fight like a man, okay?

496
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,287
Now, you take the first shot.

497
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:31,205
Give me your best punch,
all right? Come on.

498
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:33,647
Come on.
Give it to me, pipsqueak.

499
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:47,880
How'd you sleep, ace?

500
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:53,844
- Okay.
- Good.

501
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:56,970
How's your face?

502
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:59,691
Fine. No problem.

503
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:03,128
Partial apology if I did
any permanent damage.

504
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:05,645
It'd take
a lot more than you got

505
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,564
to give me
any permanent damage.

506
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:14,251
Now, my doctor wants me to get
my cholesterol to under 1,000,

507
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:19,201
but, uh, hot cakes and bacon
on a cold day, pretty sexy.

508
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:23,204
I want you to know that I could have
hurt you a lot more than I did.

509
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:24,850
- Yeah.
- Seriously.

510
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,162
- I'm a high brown belt.
- Yeah?

511
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:30,051
Yeah.
I been training for three years.

512
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,400
Your working-class ego
can't handle a kid

513
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:42,406
of my position and standing
beating you up, can it?

514
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:44,403
My working-class ego
can handle that

515
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:46,767
and a hell of a lot more.

516
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:50,003
Are you admitting that
I could defeat you in a fight?

517
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:53,365
Why don't you shut up?

518
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,807
I beat you mentally.

519
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,968
Then I beat you physically.

520
00:53:58,120 --> 00:53:59,884
You know, yesterday
you had nothing to say.

521
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:03,123
Today you're a parrot.
I'm ready here.

522
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,644
You know,
for a split second last night,

523
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,290
I sort of respected you

524
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:14,523
for how you handled the cops
and the accident,

525
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:18,969
but today I see my initial
impression is correct.

526
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,362
You're a clod.

527
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:27,081
And the cool part is
I could say that

528
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,487
and you can't
do anything about it,

529
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:31,449
'cause I can kick your butt.

530
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:37,483
Well, I won't cop to that,
but I will say this.

531
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:39,961
There's one thing I can do
that you can't.

532
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:42,407
What?

533
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,927
I can pay for my breakfast.

534
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:00,209
Nothing burps better than bacon.

535
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,641
Your water looked tasty.

536
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,370
You're insane.

537
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:35,888
Do you have any idea how
dangerous it is to hitchhike?

538
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:40,931
You have a high brown belt.
What are you worried about?

539
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,484
You're an idiot.

540
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,005
You got a better way
to get home?

541
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,766
We're not without means,
for God's sake.

542
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:51,526
We are at the moment.
We got 20 bucks.

543
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,523
You ever heard of a telephone?

544
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:57,127
Call my mother.
I'll call my grandfather.

545
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,568
You know, someday you're
gonna get into a situation

546
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:03,688
where you can't call for help.

547
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:05,689
You'll have to depend
on yourself,

548
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:07,325
and you'll let yourself down.

549
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:10,006
I'm not calling, because I
don't want your mother

550
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:12,322
to think we can't
make it home on our own.

551
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,005
Call it male pride,

552
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,606
old-fashioned, pigheaded,
working-class

553
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:20,481
pre-fax machine/car-phone,
masculine pride.

554
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:24,247
No accountants, no lawyers,
no mommies, no daddies,

555
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:28,650
no Washington lobbyist,
just a man and his wits.

556
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,643
Yeah, that's helpful

557
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:32,689
when you're facedown,
dead in a ditch.

558
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:34,205
That's part of it, too.

559
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:37,091
But you roll the dice,
you take what you get.

560
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:49,888
We're not doing too good here.

561
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:04,922
Excuse me.

562
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:10,204
Does that music
have to be so loud?

563
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,608
Thank you.

564
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:37,087
What'd you pay for them shoes?

565
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:44,080
Did you steal 'em?

566
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,644
I charged them.

567
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:51,926
Hmm.

568
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:58,883
See, my friend here
really wants those shoes.

569
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:20,689
Well, we're really
movin' now, huh?

570
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:26,682
It's your mother.
Come on, talk to her.

571
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:51,322
Getting hungry
for your turkey dinner?

572
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:04,849
Remember, I'm your dad.
I got a bad heart.

573
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:08,324
Dale, look at me.

574
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:12,489
Is that your most pathetic look?

575
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:15,371
This is my "death to you" look.

576
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:17,602
That's not gonna get us a ride.

577
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:20,081
Be pathetic! Try it!

578
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:25,807
Pretend that you're not gonna
get $10 million when you're 21.

579
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:29,169
You have no plan, do you?

580
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:30,810
I got a rough outline.

581
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:35,371
Actually, I'm the idiot

582
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,443
'cause I'm going along with it.

583
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:42,322
See?

584
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,801
Hands up. Try it.

585
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:48,045
Come on.

586
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:50,965
Look up. Look up.

587
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:52,565
Come on. Come on, come on,

588
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:53,881
come on, come on,
come on, come on.

589
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:10,730
Hurry. It's freezing.

590
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:14,009
All right. Oh, no.

591
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:16,480
Oh, my God.

592
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,768
That's it. Smile, smile.

593
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:20,809
Smile. That's it.

594
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:33,242
Smile with that face.

595
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:42,090
Attaboy, attaboy.

596
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:46,842
Oh, help us here, please.

597
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,608
It's pathetic.
It is really pathetic.

598
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:52,649
Beg. Help me.

599
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:55,041
Help me.

600
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:56,440
I don't have a ride.

601
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:59,763
Help me. Help me.

602
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:01,285
We have to help them.

603
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:10,642
You want a ride,
you gotta look grievous.

604
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,010
Huh?

605
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:24,881
Hey, kid!

606
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:30,647
We're going to Hammond.
Do you wanna come along?

607
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:32,882
Get the suitcase. Let's go.
We got a ride.

608
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:34,241
Come on, let's go.

609
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,129
Not too fast, but not too slow.

610
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:37,884
All right, that's it.
Wave it to her.

611
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:40,008
That's it, yeah.

612
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:18,642
You guys on vacation
or something?

613
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:21,246
We're going home to Hammond
for the holidays.

614
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:23,243
Both our families
are from there.

615
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:25,721
Oh. We're going home, too.

616
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:28,884
- You got a nice kid.
- Yeah.

617
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:41,488
So, what's the word on you two?

618
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:44,007
- How do you mean?
- Well, are you drifters?

619
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:45,650
Well, yeah. Yeah, more or less.

620
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:47,484
Yeah, I thought so.

621
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:49,722
- How about you?
- Brock?

622
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:52,326
Yeah?

623
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:55,165
Dutch wants to know what we do.

624
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:56,731
Well, I don't want to be nosy,
you know.

625
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,769
I was just making conversation.
It's not important.

626
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:00,928
- No.
- No, please. It's fine.

627
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:02,411
- No, tell him.
- Stop.

628
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:03,925
We're call girls.

629
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,480
I didn't want to say prostitute
in front of the boy.

630
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:24,608
I appreciate it.

631
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:30,369
So we were down in New Orleans
at the Superdome

632
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:32,488
for the housewares convention.

633
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:36,921
Well, we also do
a little dancing.

634
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:38,690
Naked?

635
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:43,129
Don't worry about it.
I have a little brother.

636
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:45,442
Just on top, sweetie.

637
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:23,651
So your parents know,
and they haven't disowned you?

638
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:26,246
No, not yet.

639
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:29,165
Don't you think
that's a little amazing?

640
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:31,971
Mm, not really.
I'm honest about it.

641
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:34,521
And I don't hurt anybody,
not on purpose.

642
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:37,485
You don't think
it hurts your parents?

643
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:40,843
Well, eventually,
if you live long enough,

644
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,525
you're bound to hurt
your parents somehow.

645
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:44,682
Yeah.

646
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:49,284
It's none of my business.

647
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:54,810
So do you get along
with your dad?

648
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:59,363
Guy's not my dad.
That's my mother's boyfriend.

649
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,887
I hate saying that.
It's so sick.

650
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,885
He's picking me up
for Thanksgiving break

651
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:08,691
'cause I go to this
private school down south.

652
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:11,770
I hate his guts.

653
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:17,246
He's trying to get to know me

654
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:21,246
'cause I think he's planning
on marrying my mother.

655
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:25,129
Is there something wrong
with that?

656
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:28,891
I'm not too crazy
about my mother to begin with,

657
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:31,042
and he's just a slob.

658
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:33,487
The less I know, the better.

659
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:36,644
Yeah, well, he seems
to be going through

660
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:38,484
a lot of shit to get you home.

661
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:40,927
It's on purpose.

662
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:42,690
See, he's got
this ridiculous plan

663
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:44,888
to drag me around
until I break.

664
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:48,449
He's got a shock coming, though.

665
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:49,965
I don't break.

666
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:51,610
Hmm.

667
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:54,411
So, what's wrong with your mom?

668
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:57,564
She divorced my dad
for starters.

669
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:00,411
Yeah, well, it takes two
to make a thing go bad.

670
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:01,806
She didn't make it work.

671
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:05,169
Hmm.

672
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:08,767
You know, maybe it's
just easier to blame her.

673
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:50,642
You know, maybe you should stop
knocking your mom so much

674
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:52,131
and try to make things
work with her.

675
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:57,647
I don't think
that's gonna happen.

676
01:06:57,800 --> 01:06:59,609
But I really like
talking to you.

677
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:05,330
Well, maybe I'll come up
and visit you sometime.

678
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:08,165
That would be excellent.

679
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:08,931
Brock.

680
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:11,560
Brock, hey.

681
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:13,449
You wanna wake up
your little friend

682
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:15,648
so he can stretch his legs?

683
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,684
Mm.

684
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:25,971
Hey.

685
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:28,049
Hey, wake up.

686
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:34,968
You want to go for a walk?

687
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:42,081
Yeah.

688
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:46,006
Yeah. I was just
dreaming about that.

689
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,525
Ugh.

690
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:24,041
What time is it?

691
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:26,123
7:30.

692
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:28,169
I'll drive the next shift.

693
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:30,084
I'm fine. Could you do me
a favor, though?

694
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:31,651
Could you go inside
and get directions?

695
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:33,643
I just want to make sure
I don't get all screwed up.

696
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:35,802
Sure.
We got enough time to eat?

697
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:38,042
Yeah, yeah. You go inside,
and we'll take care of this,

698
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:39,770
and we'll meet you inside,
all right?

699
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:42,491
- Let's go, Dobie.
- Uh...

700
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:45,245
I'll come in with Brock.

701
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:47,801
Uh, no, you go ahead, babe.

702
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:52,727
I, uh... I have to get
something from my bag.

703
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:54,325
I'll meet you inside, okay?

704
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:55,811
Okay.

705
01:09:57,720 --> 01:09:59,131
Bye.

706
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:03,770
Yes, yes, yes.

707
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:05,888
I lifted the toad's wallet.

708
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:08,008
Ahh!

709
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:10,003
Why?

710
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:12,003
Because it was there.

711
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:15,289
Well, I was just beginning
to feel respectable.

712
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:18,450
Let's not waste
a lot of time eating, okay?

713
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:24,050
Uh, I want to get back
in the car and keep moving.

714
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:25,844
Yeah.

715
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,048
Yeah, I know why you want
to keep moving.

716
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:30,163
Let me tell you
something, Dwight.

717
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:32,163
Those two gals are
a couple of pros.

718
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:34,607
You know, I got half a mind
to refuse the rest of the trip.

719
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:36,410
Do you know
what your mother would say

720
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:38,483
if she knew
what you were doing?

721
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:43,407
You refuse the ride,
I'll tell her in detail.

722
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:47,203
You know, you really are
a hypocrite, aren't you?

723
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:50,364
A couple of hookers...

724
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:53,364
couple of hookers got a set
of rockets, that's okay,

725
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:56,086
but anyone else in their station
in life is scum.

726
01:10:56,240 --> 01:10:57,571
That's not true.

727
01:10:57,720 --> 01:10:59,768
Well, you and I are riding
in the back seat from now on

728
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:01,763
because what that
missile twister can teach you,

729
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:03,570
you don't need to learn
till you're in prison.

730
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:06,644
I'll decide what I need to know,
and she's not like that.

731
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:08,211
She listens.

732
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:10,925
That's her job.

733
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:22,888
Shit!

734
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:24,610
My wallet!

735
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:32,762
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

736
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:39,768
I can't believe it.

737
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:41,524
Believe it.

738
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:43,569
Your angel
with the dirty wings flew,

739
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:46,929
taking my wallet,
my luggage, my last cigar.

740
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:49,811
She was so understanding
about my problems.

741
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:55,645
Stuff your problems!

742
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:57,689
If you weren't such
a spoiled little worm,

743
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:59,683
such a whining little rodent,

744
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:01,808
I wouldn't have had
to come down here for you.

745
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,729
You asked for it,
and you got it.

746
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,729
- True.
- It's not my fault.

747
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:07,649
True.
Yeah, it's your mother's fault.

748
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:09,285
Why is it her fault?

749
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:11,124
Because she gave birth to you.

750
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:14,443
- And what about your mother?
- My mother's a saint.

751
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:16,642
For what, having puppies?

752
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:22,006
Oh. Oh, you want more, huh?

753
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:23,605
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I do.

754
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:27,842
Come and get it.

755
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:34,810
Chicken!

756
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:38,201
Ahh!

757
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:40,567
Ohh!

758
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:55,889
God, you're pathetic.

759
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:10,682
Here's the deal, Dobsy.

760
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:14,362
I had 200 bucks in the wallet.

761
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:20,367
- You said you were broke.
- I lied.

762
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:26,689
You dishonest, stupid jerk.

763
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:31,568
We had money all this time?

764
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:33,000
We could have been home.

765
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:36,004
Probably, but I had this plan.

766
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:38,003
- Yeah, I know.
- No, you don't know!

767
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:41,004
I know you were playing around,
stretching this whole thing out

768
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:43,527
so we could
get to know each other,

769
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:45,250
and then it blew up
in your face.

770
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:47,568
I blew it. I'm sorry.

771
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:50,166
I'm also out of ideas.

772
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:55,488
I'm just gonna sit here

773
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:59,361
and hope I get arrested
so I can get some sleep.

774
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:02,370
Call your mother.

775
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:04,124
Have her send somebody for you.

776
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:05,770
You can call, can't you?

777
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:08,566
I don't want to call.
I'm sitting here, and that's it.

778
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:11,041
You talk to your mom.

779
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:14,204
You tell her
that I said, uh, good luck.

780
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:16,283
Tell her the Dutchboy's
calling it quits.

781
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:20,609
You're dumping my mom?

782
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:24,321
I'm sparing her of a life
of this kind of misery.

783
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:27,126
She's gonna blame me.

784
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:31,922
I'll write a letter for you,
nice letter, okay? Go on.

785
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:33,844
I thought you loved her.

786
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,765
I've talked and talked
and talked to you

787
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:38,968
until I could puke coat hangers.

788
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:41,731
I'm me. You're you.
There's no reason on Earth

789
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:44,201
why we should spend
any more time with each other.

790
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:49,442
Okay. I just think it's really
sick that you'd cut my mom loose

791
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:51,284
because you can't
get along with me.

792
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:54,523
Why? You hate her.

793
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:58,009
Don't fret. It's okay.

794
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:00,401
She puts up with your crap,
she can handle mine.

795
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:02,204
I never said that I hated her.

796
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:04,283
No. Gee, I'm sorry.

797
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:07,171
You're "the picture's
worth a thousand words" guy.

798
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:09,288
Yeah. Now, go on. Go on.

799
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:11,369
Make your call.
Give me some peace.

800
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:15,684
I don't hate my mother
for the record.

801
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:17,683
Kiss my ass for the record!

802
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:22,565
Act like a rodent around
somebody else.

803
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:25,451
You've busted my balls.
Congratulations.

804
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:27,602
Go on.

805
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:41,211
Did she ever say
that she thinks I hate her?

806
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:12,922
Don't get it.

807
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:14,161
Hello.

808
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:17,210
Is... is Mr. Standish in?

809
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:20,967
He's sleeping. Who's this?

810
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:44,562
Mmm.

811
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:46,449
Who was it?

812
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:49,649
Some kid.

813
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:14,090
Come on.

814
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:17,487
We can make it home.

815
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:19,802
We got this far, didn't we?

816
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:29,969
- Where you going?
- Home.

817
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:31,605
How?

818
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:34,240
I'm calling your mom.
Enough of this.

819
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,084
Wait a minute.

820
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:39,528
It would really mean a lot to me

821
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:42,445
to not have to call
my mother for help.

822
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:49,088
You remember this?

823
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:51,208
I still owe you one.

824
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:52,964
You let me call your mom,
I forget about it.

825
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:55,771
- No dice.
- This isn't working out.

826
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:57,490
We're not masters
of the highway.

827
01:17:57,640 --> 01:17:59,688
We were robbed
by homebound hookers.

828
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:03,162
Only because you fell asleep
and I got...

829
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:07,564
...horny.

830
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,286
You did?

831
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:17,010
Sort of.

832
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:23,766
Congratulations.

833
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:27,327
Slap it.

834
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,411
There you go.

835
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:35,127
See, I'm not
such a bad guy, huh?

836
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:37,123
Yeah, yeah, you are.

837
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:40,250
But I'm still going
to get you home.

838
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:21,725
We're here.

839
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:24,849
Where?

840
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,490
I don't know.

841
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:45,204
Well, there's got to be a...

842
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:48,603
there's gotta be a guard around
here somewhere. We'll ask him.

843
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:51,371
Get out of here.

844
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:53,170
Don't come back.

845
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:05,491
I could sue you for this.

846
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:10,211
Hey, the kid doesn't mean it.

847
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:11,771
I do so.

848
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:15,083
And you can't hit me,
'cause I'm a minor.

849
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,968
Hey, hey.

850
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:24,281
Hey, you okay?

851
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:25,521
Hey, I told you guys
to get out of here.

852
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:26,966
Hey, what the hell
is wrong with you?

853
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:28,167
- What the hell...
- Hey!

854
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:29,651
We don't want any trouble,
all right?

855
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:31,205
Hey! Give me my stick back.

856
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:33,283
Relax, all right?
Why don't you guys go inside

857
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:34,601
and we'll hit the road,
all right?

858
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:39,682
- Get away from him!
- Yeah, yeah.

859
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:43,565
I said leave him alone!

860
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:47,327
Al, knock it off.
You, get your pal out of here!

861
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:49,323
You're outnumbered now, boy.

862
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:54,321
Come on, you little kid.

863
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,923
- Hyah!
- Ohh!

864
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:23,126
Ohh.

865
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:24,406
Are you okay?

866
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:27,723
- Ooh, we're gonna get you, kid.
- Yeah.

867
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:32,363
You got me mad now.
You really got me m...

868
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:34,363
Doyle, listen to me. Listen.

869
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:36,522
I'm gonna make you
eat that gun.

870
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:38,409
All right, now you guys
really did it.

871
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,085
You got him angry.

872
01:21:40,240 --> 01:21:43,369
Pete, let's go.
You don't have to shoot 'em.

873
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:47,127
Pete, you don't
have to shoot 'em!

874
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:48,884
You don't have
to shoot 'em, Pete.

875
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:50,690
The kid is crazy.

876
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:54,726
Don't be crazy, Pete.
Don't be crazy, Pete.

877
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:58,282
Tell the voices
that you just killed somebody.

878
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:01,603
You know, that guy.
You just killed somebody!

879
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:03,603
Yeah!

880
01:22:05,480 --> 01:22:08,006
Uhh! Ohh,
I just killed somebody!

881
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:09,525
He just killed somebody.

882
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:11,489
They won't listen.

883
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:13,051
Don't shoot me.

884
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:15,004
I gotta do it.

885
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:16,770
I gotta get rid of the voices!

886
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:18,445
Listen, listen,
it's the holiday season.

887
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:19,931
These guys
probably got families.

888
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:21,281
- I do!
- Yeah.

889
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:23,568
- I do! He's single.
- Why'd you say that?

890
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:25,245
Now I gotta kill
your families, too.

891
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:27,402
Calm down, Pete.
Look, forget these guys.

892
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:30,643
We'll find some nice motel
you can burn down.

893
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:35,560
Yeah, motel, lots of people.

894
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:39,925
Okay.

895
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:42,208
You guys are very lucky.

896
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:45,409
This kid hardly ever backs off
once he gets his neck up.

897
01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:48,483
So long, guys.

898
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:05,249
Excuse me, but would you
please get out of here?

899
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:08,131
This isn't a warming house,
you know.

900
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:11,443
Boy has a wound on his head.
We need to use the restroom.

901
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:14,968
I'm so sorry,
but from time to time, these

902
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:18,966
road people wander in.
Excuse me.

903
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:21,804
I said out.

904
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:23,849
- Can he wash his face?
- No!

905
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,843
I'll go outside.
Let him use the bathroom.

906
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:29,322
Robert, you want to come over
here and help me?

907
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:33,324
Excuse us.

908
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:35,369
Excuse me. Excuse me, sir.
You're on the road?

909
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:37,881
Yeah. Why?

910
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:40,486
The boy's your son?

911
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:45,128
That's right.

912
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:47,442
We're up from Georgia
on our way to Chicago.

913
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:49,284
Lost our car. We got robbed.

914
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:51,886
- Oh, God.
- It's all right.

915
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:04,041
They'll take good care
of you here.

916
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:05,486
Who?

917
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:09,241
Well, this is a center
for displaced families.

918
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:12,410
Mike's supervisor
is on the board.

919
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:16,485
So, good luck, all right?
Don't give up.

920
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:18,290
Okay?

921
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:20,930
Have a little faith
in your father.

922
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:23,367
He's doing his best, okay?

923
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:26,763
All right. Bye-bye.
Let's go, hon.

924
01:24:28,280 --> 01:24:29,566
Bye-bye.

925
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:40,601
And, uh, all our best
for a happy holiday.

926
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:21,567
Would you like
to see the wine list?

927
01:26:39,640 --> 01:26:41,244
That's mine.

928
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:09,922
You can have it.

929
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:23,804
That was nice.

930
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:39,244
Jeez!

931
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:52,449
Son of a...

932
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:55,649
You have to click it.

933
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:00,600
Is there a problem?

934
01:28:00,760 --> 01:28:02,649
No, no, I got it. Thanks.

935
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:40,522
Ahh, jeez.

936
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:44,846
Shh!

937
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:52,047
Shh!

938
01:28:56,160 --> 01:28:57,810
Trying to get some sleep here.

939
01:28:57,960 --> 01:28:59,724
It's all right now. Come on.

940
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:16,529
Doyle. Switch cots with me.

941
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:19,445
Mine won't hold me.

942
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:21,250
How do you know it'll hold me?

943
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:24,643
Because I'm 15,000 cheeseburgers
ahead of you in life.

944
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:09,044
Hi.

945
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:33,040
You from Hammond?

946
01:30:33,240 --> 01:30:35,971
- Chicago.
- Oh.

947
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:40,406
I'm from South Bend originally.

948
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:45,044
Came to Hammond to look
for work, me and my husband.

949
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:49,569
Lost his job in June,

950
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:52,929
worked for one of those auto
part companies that went broke.

951
01:30:55,280 --> 01:30:57,282
We've been here
for about a week.

952
01:30:57,440 --> 01:30:58,930
It's nice.

953
01:31:01,240 --> 01:31:04,847
We was living
out of the back of our car.

954
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,765
That's kind of hard.

955
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:09,809
What about you?

956
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:15,250
We got here tonight.

957
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:17,323
You and your daddy?

958
01:31:31,720 --> 01:31:33,449
Yeah.

959
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:38,771
Do you have a mother?

960
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:45,761
But she's not with you,
though, huh?

961
01:31:48,680 --> 01:31:51,411
Where's she at, Chicago?

962
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:53,005
Yeah.

963
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:56,050
And I bet you'd like

964
01:31:56,200 --> 01:31:58,202
to be with her
right now, wouldn't you?

965
01:31:58,360 --> 01:32:00,203
Yes.

966
01:32:01,680 --> 01:32:05,162
Yeah, I would.

967
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:07,527
It'll happen.

968
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:11,806
Hope so.

969
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:16,164
That's all any of us
in here can do.

970
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:18,448
What?

971
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:21,206
Hope.

972
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:32,763
You'd better get some sleep.

973
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:34,809
Okay.

974
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:57,241
Doyle.

975
01:32:59,320 --> 01:33:02,449
While you were brushing
your teeth, I called your mom.

976
01:33:02,600 --> 01:33:04,682
I told her we were
at the Holiday Inn

977
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:07,207
so she wouldn't worry.
Is that okay?

978
01:33:08,640 --> 01:33:09,641
Yeah.

979
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:12,201
You know,
'cause I said I wouldn't call.

980
01:33:12,360 --> 01:33:16,126
No. No, that's okay.

981
01:33:16,280 --> 01:33:17,566
Good night.

982
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:34,402
Did you hear me talking?

983
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:37,403
No, not really.

984
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:40,211
I meant it.

985
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:46,002
I appreciate it.

986
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:03,771
You still gonna shoot me
in the ass?

987
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:11,803
Yes.

988
01:34:15,240 --> 01:34:17,402
Good night.

989
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:18,846
Good night.

990
01:35:13,240 --> 01:35:14,810
That's them.

991
01:35:20,040 --> 01:35:22,964
He'll be so happy to see you.

992
01:35:48,240 --> 01:35:50,208
Hello, Natalie.

993
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:56,202
I'm sorry.

994
01:35:56,360 --> 01:35:58,124
Were you expecting the mailman?

995
01:36:46,720 --> 01:36:48,563
You take care,
the both of you, now.

996
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:50,449
Now, you call the office
first thing Monday morning.

997
01:36:50,600 --> 01:36:52,011
I'll see what I can do for you.

998
01:36:52,200 --> 01:36:55,409
- Doyle, happy Thanksgiving.
- I will.

999
01:36:55,560 --> 01:36:57,403
- Thanks.
- Good luck.

1000
01:36:57,560 --> 01:36:59,847
Okay. Happy Thanksgiving.

1001
01:37:31,400 --> 01:37:33,243
Hey, buddy!

1002
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:35,243
Surprise. Huh?

1003
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:05,645
Mom.

1004
01:38:46,160 --> 01:38:48,731
I'm sorry.
Could you step outside?

1005
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:50,803
This is a family matter.

1006
01:38:58,840 --> 01:39:01,366
Now, why don't you say goodbye
to your mother?

1007
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:03,522
Why don't you come to my house?

1008
01:39:03,680 --> 01:39:06,047
We've got a lot
to talk about, huh?

1009
01:39:09,320 --> 01:39:11,163
I canceled
an important overseas trip

1010
01:39:11,320 --> 01:39:12,924
to spend this holiday with you.

1011
01:39:14,160 --> 01:39:16,162
No, you didn't.

1012
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:19,324
I called your house,
and a lady answered.

1013
01:39:19,480 --> 01:39:22,723
- You lied to me.
- Don't talk to me that way.

1014
01:39:24,040 --> 01:39:25,326
It's true.

1015
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:31,049
You make up your mind
right now, Doyle.

1016
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:33,726
Are you coming with me
or are you staying here?

1017
01:39:35,680 --> 01:39:37,091
Your decision is final.

1018
01:39:45,200 --> 01:39:47,248
I'm staying here, Dad.

1019
01:39:58,960 --> 01:40:01,691
Ah, fine.

1020
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:11,602
I want you
out of here by Monday.

1021
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:41,046
Excuse me.

1022
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:50,451
You wanted Natalie out by when?

1023
01:40:50,600 --> 01:40:52,090
Monday.

1024
01:40:52,240 --> 01:40:54,766
I'm sorry, I didn't quite...

1025
01:40:54,920 --> 01:40:56,809
I said...

1026
01:41:04,040 --> 01:41:05,724
Friday?

1027
01:41:07,480 --> 01:41:09,528
Well, she's probably gonna need
a little more time. Uh...

1028
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,526
- How's six months sound to you?
- No problem.

1029
01:41:13,680 --> 01:41:15,489
And you're gonna be a little
more respectful of Natalie?

1030
01:41:15,640 --> 01:41:17,085
Absolutely.

1031
01:41:17,240 --> 01:41:18,969
And you're gonna work on being
a nice guy with your son

1032
01:41:19,120 --> 01:41:22,761
because he still loves you.
He's a great kid.

1033
01:41:22,920 --> 01:41:24,763
He doesn't deserve
having his feelings hurt

1034
01:41:24,920 --> 01:41:28,129
or his mind played with,
especially not by his dad.

1035
01:41:33,480 --> 01:41:34,970
I like him a lot.
I'm his friend,

1036
01:41:35,120 --> 01:41:36,531
but, see,
I'm never gonna be his father.

1037
01:41:36,680 --> 01:41:39,650
That's your job.
You'd better learn to do it.

1038
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:41,848
Yes, sir.

1039
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,571
Good.

1040
01:41:47,200 --> 01:41:50,647
Pleasure seeing you again.

1041
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:52,529
Happy holidays.

1042
01:41:52,680 --> 01:41:54,842
- Thank yo... thank you.
- Hey.

1043
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,002
Whoa!

1044
01:42:13,560 --> 01:42:14,766
I'm okay.

1045
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:28,731
And here it is.
- Oh, good.

1046
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:31,611
Oh, wow. Thank you, dear.

1047
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:33,330
A thing of beauty.
- That looks good.

1048
01:42:35,560 --> 01:42:36,971
Uh, Dave...

1049
01:42:37,120 --> 01:42:38,281
Yeah?

1050
01:42:38,440 --> 01:42:40,488
Before we start,
run in the other room

1051
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:41,721
and get my coat, will you?

1052
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:44,161
I got something in there
for your mother.

1053
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:47,490
- Right now?
- Yeah.

1054
01:42:47,680 --> 01:42:49,250
Can't it wait?

1055
01:42:49,400 --> 01:42:51,767
Well, it's something
very special.

1056
01:42:53,880 --> 01:42:55,882
Okay.

1057
01:42:58,480 --> 01:42:59,766
Move over.

1058
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:47,167
Yipes!
