2
0:00:53.508 --> 00:00:55.351
Give me a break

3
0:00:58.552 --> 0:01:01.232
So you guys excited?
- Dream come true.

4
0:01:01,301 --> 0:01:03,424
Yeah, Europe again.

5
0:01:03,528 --> 0:01:06,277
It's just my parents trying 
to get rid of me for two months.

6
0:01:06,311 --> 0:01:07,773
What else is new?

7
0:01:07,843 --> 0:01:09,860
So Swell, when's your Mom
 leaving for Australia?

8
0:01:09,896 --> 00:01:13,063
Ooh, in about an hour and a half. 
I can't wait

9
00:01:13,167 --> 00:01:15,289
I'm getting get rid of her
for two whole months you guys

10
00:01:15,358 --> 00:01:18,490
Wait, I don't understand.
So your mom can afford to go to Australia

11
00:01:18,524 --> 00:01:22,038
But she can't afford to send you to Europe
With some friends for graduation?

12
00:01:22.074 --> 00:01:25.762
- Yeah, aren;t you pissed you can't go?
- Ah, her boyfriend's paying for it.

13
00:01:25.832 --> 00:01:27.919
He wants her to see his sheep ranch.

14
00:01:29.381 --> 00:01:32.198
Besides, she needs the growing 
experience a lot more than I do.

15
00:01:32.303 --> 00:01:35.678
She's leaving you guys all alone?
What about the kids? Hmmm

16
00:01:35.748 --> 00:01:40.063
Kenny will watch Zack, Melissa will 
watch Walter, And I'll have Mom's car.

17
00:01:40.097 --> 00:01:42.847
I can go to the beach,
I can stay out as late as I want to.

18
00:01:42.915 --> 00:01:45.108
I can do anything. I'm a free woman

19
00:01:47.266 --> 00:01:49.492
Melissa lunch, Honey

20
00:01:49.527 --> 00:01:51.092
- Come on.
- Yeah, Right!

21
0:02:04.035 --> 0:02:06.367
Melissa, Right now.

22
0:02:06.472 --> 00:02:10.160
- Elvis needs fresh water.
- I'll do it in a minute

23
00:02:10.265 --> 00:02:12,700
Zack, put it back.

24
00:02:12.805 --> 00:02:16.806
- Right Now
- If you need money, ask me first

25
00:02:16.841 --> 00:02:19.485
- Okay then. Can I get ten dollars?
- forget it.

26
00:02:19.554 --> 00:02:21.781
Fry you suckers.

27
00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.644
Earth to Melissa

28
00:02:25.713 --> 00:02:27.697
How come you gotta go?

29
00:02:27.731 --> 00:02:32.707
Because. I've had a very rough 37 years 
and I need a break

30
00:02:32.742 --> 00:02:34.656
You swore you'd sign me up for baseball

31
00:02:34.725 --> 00:02:38.622
- Little League will be there next year.
- So will Australia

32
00:02:38.692 --> 00:02:40.710
- I wish Dad were around.
- No you don't

33
00:02:43.458 --> 00:02:45.441
Kenny, c'mon give me a break

34
00:02:45.546 --> 00:02:48.226
You haven't taken out the trash in weeks,
And the lawn needs mowing

35
00:02:48.294 --> 00:02:50.834
And your room looks like a disaster area

36
00:02:56.264 --> 00:02:58.873
- See you, Swell.
- Bye bye, Swell

37
0:03:00.473 --> 0:03:03.744
Stay away from her. 
She's in one of her Terminator moods.


38
0:03:03.813 --> 0:03:04.962
Hey, Nicole

39
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17.314
Swell, how's my baby

40
00:03:17.418 --> 00:03:19.541
In your dreams, babe.

41
00:03:21.002 --> 00:03:22.498
Hi, Mom

42
00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.717
Why did you leave 
your dishes in the sink... For me?

43
00:03:27.787 --> 00:03:30.536
God, you take these things so personally.

44
00:03:30.641 --> 00:03:33.632
- The dishwashers full, ok.
- So empty it

45
00:03:33.702 --> 00:03:35.755
That's Kenny's job

46
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.434
Kenny, Get back here

47
00:03:38.504 --> 00:03:40.070
Right Now!

48
00:03:40.104 --> 00:03:43.236
I'll do it later, Mom! I promise

49
00:03:43.306 --> 00:03:46.228
Is your Mom like leaving for like months?

50
00:03:46.297 --> 00:03:48.942
Oh, shit, you're right. Bye, Mom

51
00:03:49.012 --> 00:03:51.169
- Bye Mom. Have a blast!
- Right

52
00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.361
Rock and roll!

53
00:03:57.501 --> 0:04:00.146
- No prizes.
- Hey, Swell
- Hi.

54
0:04:00.251 --> 0:04:04.460
Well as usual, your brother's proven he's not
the least bit involved with this family.

55
0:04:04.531 --> 0:04:07.628
Oh relax, Mom. I'll keep him in Line.

56
0:04:07.697 --> 00:04:10.515
Well, did you see his report card?
He got all D's.

57
00:04:10.585 --> 00:04:12.011
Well did you yell at him?

58
00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.690
No. I couldn't.
It's an improvement.

59
00:04:14.725 --> 00:04:17.509
So Mom, takin' off on us
like that, huh?

60
00:04:17.613 --> 00:04:19.944
Shirkin' all that
parental responsibility.

61
00:04:20.014 --> 00:04:23.771
Oh, I'm sure everything
will be taken care of.

62
00:04:23.842 --> 00:04:26.834
Yeah. Relax, Mom

63
00:04:26.903 --> 00:04:29.583
Everything's gonna be great
when you're gone.

64
00:04:55.435 --> 00:04:57.348
Hello, dear.

65
00:04:57.418 --> 0:05:00.341
I'm Mrs. Sturak I babysitter

66
0:05:02.080 --> 0:05:03.298
I'm Mrs. Sturak.
I'm the baby-sitter.

67
0:05:04.446 --> 0:05:07.056
- Mother?
- She seems very nice.

68
0:05:07.161 --> 00:05:10.327
Right? And she has
lots of experience.

69
00:05:10.396 --> 00:05:14.051
Of course she does.
She's 200 years old.

70
00:05:14.085 --> 00:05:16.591
It's not fair.
Baby-sitters suck.

71
00:05:18.712 --> 00:05:21.391
- Mrs. Sturak.
- Yes?

72
00:05:21.461 --> 00:05:24.802
You know there are
five children?

73
00:05:24.871 --> 00:05:28.350
- Yes, of course.
- Do you think you can handle the job?

74
00:05:28.386 --> 00:05:31.134
Of course I can.
My family's all gone.

75
00:05:31.204 --> 00:05:34.231
Taking care of others' little ones
is my whole life.

76
00:05:34.301 --> 00:05:37.397
I didn't get a chance
to go to the store...

77
00:05:37.468 --> 00:05:41.887
but there's money in here for groceries
and some spending money for the kids.

78
00:05:41.991 --> 00:05:46.374
There's also a list of instructions,
and the phone number in Australia.

79
00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.610
- You go have a lovely time.
- Thank you.

80
00:05:49.714 --> 00:05:52.393
Walter, come give Mommy a kiss.

81
00:05:55.073 --> 00:05:57.056
Bye, Elvis.

82
00:05:57.126 --> 00:05:59.632
Melissa, want to
come down from there?

83
00:05:59.666 --> 0:06:02.797
- No.
- Get down from there.

84
0:06:06.764 --> 00:06:10,000
I can't believe you're
doing this to me. A baby-sitter?

85
00:06:10,104 --> 00:06:13.027
Honey, I couldn't
leave you kids all alone.

86
00:06:13.097 --> 00:06:17.064
You're not capable of running the show
while I'm gone. You're not an adult yet.

87
00:06:17.132 --> 00:06:21.622
Now, I know we've been over this
at least a thousand times...

88
00:06:21.656 --> 00:06:24.788
but please, don't do anything
you know I'd be against.

89
00:06:24.857 --> 00:06:27.954
I don't wanna hearyou've given
this nice old lady a hard time.

90
00:06:27.989 --> 00:06:30.877
You're gonna miss your flight.

91
00:06:30.946 --> 00:06:34.878
Promise me you'll go register
at City College for fall, okay?

92
00:06:35.992 --> 00:06:38.114
I haven't quite
decided on that yet.

93
00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.071
I'll miss you.

94
00:06:43.855 --> 00:06:45.943
- Bye, Mom.
- Yeah.

95
00:06:46.012 --> 00:06:49.736
Bye, everybody.
Listen to Mrs. Sturak.

96
00:06:49.805 --> 00:06:52.589
Mom, can you call us every day?

97
00:06:52.693 --> 00:06:56.868
Walter, this is Mom's vacation,
but I'll try.

98
00:06:56.903 --> 00:06:59.095
Mrs. Sturak knows
where to reach me.

99
00:06:59.200 --> 0:07:01.739
Bye, sweetheart.
Be good.

100
0:07:01.775 --> 0:07:05.463
Love you. Bye, honey.
Be good, everybody!

101
0:07:05.532 --> 0:07:08.316
Take care of each other!

102
00:07:25.469 --> 00:07:28.984
You little maggots, line up!
Time to go over the rules!

103
00:07:29.019 --> 00:07:31.524
Excuse me?
Are you serious?

104
00:07:31.559 --> 00:07:35.490
You can't run a tight ship
without rules. Now move!

105
00:07:37.822 --> 00:07:40.153
- What's this lady's problem?
- I'm scared.

106
00:07:40.223 --> 00:07:42.066
I am too.

107
00:07:42.171 --> 00:07:45.754
Lady, I don't know what your deal is,
but you're not here to order us around.

108
00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:48.121
I've had about enough
ofyour lip, missy.

109
00:07:49.025 --> 00:07:50.383
Cooperate...

110
00:07:50.417 --> 00:07:54.141
or I'll make your summer
a living hell!

111
0:08:04.161 --> 0:08:06.144
Dr.. Louise Westheimer..

112
0:08:06.214 --> 0:08:07.919
Alaska

113
0:08:09.484 --> 00:08:12.547
Alaska-- Alaska container.

114
00:08:12.651 --> 00:08:14.357
Alaska spill.

115
00:08:14.426 --> 00:08:17,000
Hey! I was watching that!

116
00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:18.913
TV rots your brains.

117
00:08:23.124 --> 00:08:24.934
Go to your room

118
00:08:25.038 --> 00:08:29.040
I expect a complete report tomorrow
morning on the life of the aardvark.

119
00:08:48.524 --> 00:08:51.969
Cynthia, you're my moon goddess.

120
00:08:58.232 --> 0:09:00.806
Time for little boys
to be in bed.

121
0:09:00.911 --> 0:09:02.895
Can't you see
I'm in the middle of a date?

122
0:09:02.999 --> 0:09:06.966
And time for little trollops
to go home!

123
0:09:07.036 --> 00:09:10.445
Wait! You can't.
Cynthia, wait!

124
00:09:11.593 --> 00:09:13,090
I'll call you later.

125
00:09:14.134 --> 00:09:15.769
Darling.

126
00:09:18.552 --> 00:09:22.901
It's time for little girls
to dress like little girls.

127
00:09:22.971 --> 00:09:24.920
Sugar and spice!

128
00:09:58.845 --> 0:10:01.106
God is definitely
pissed off at me.

129
0:10:01.176 --> 0:10:03.751
I have no money.
I have no boyfriend.

130
0:10:03.855 --> 0:10:06.361
You guys are gonna be
in Europe all summer.

131
0:10:06.396 --> 00:10:10.117
Yeah, my mom left us with
this deranged Mary Poppins.

132
00:10:10.188 --> 00:10:12.833
We've gotta get rid
of the old lady.

133
00:10:14.155 --> 00:10:17.042
Nicole, hang on.
Why are you wearing name tags?

134
00:10:17.112 --> 00:10:20.940
- She has trouble remembering things.
- We're to wear them at all times.

135
00:10:21.044 --> 00:10:25.254
She's getting us up at the butt-crack
of dawn to tidy up the garage.

136
00:10:25.323 --> 00:10:27.933
Oh, God. Nicole,
I have to call you back.

137
00:10:28.003 --> 00:10:29.916
All right. Bye.

138
00:10:29.986 --> 00:10:32.004
I really don't think
I can live like this.

139
00:10:32.074 --> 00:10:35.900
Okay, I'll talk to her.
It's time we let her know the rules.

140
00:10:35.971 --> 00:10:39.067
- Yeah, we outnumber her.
- Let's kick some ass.

141
00:10:59.283 --> 0:11:01.510
Probably can't even hear me.

142
0:11:03.668 --> 0:11:04.885
Look, Mrs. Sturak.

143
0:11:04.920 --> 0:11:07.425
Whetheryou thinkyou can
push us around or not...

144
0:11:07.460 --> 00:11:10.522
we've decided that we're not
gonna take any more ofyour crap.

145
00:11:21.969 --> 00:11:24.858
First of all,
the name tags have gotta go.

146
00:11:24.927 --> 00:11:27.885
Mrs. Sturak,
are you even listening to me?

147
00:11:56.138 --> 00:11:57.808
Oh, my God.

148
0:12:04.732 --> 0:12:05.740
Fuck.

149
0:12:07.969 --> 0:12:09.778
Hey, get out.

150
0:12:09.847 --> 00:12:12.456
Kenny, come downstairs.
You're not gonna believe this.

151
00:12:16.527 --> 00:12:20.876
I told you to talk to her. Didn't want
you to send her to the glue factory.

152
00:12:20.946 --> 00:12:24.217
I didn't kill her.
She died in her sleep.

153
00:12:24.287 --> 00:12:26,200
Probably choked on her whistle.

154
00:12:26.305 --> 00:12:28.949
- She doesn't look dead.
- That's 'cause it just happened.

155
00:12:29.053 --> 00:12:31.942
So you can't really tell,
like a MacGyver..

156
00:12:31.976 --> 00:12:34.516
What should we do with her body?

157
00:12:35.978 --> 00:12:38.518
Call an ambulance? Call the cops?
I don't know.

158
00:12:38.587 --> 00:12:40.814
They're gonna ask us
a lot of questions.

159
00:12:40.884 --> 00:12:42.901
They'll probably blame us.

160
00:12:42.937 --> 00:12:45.790
- They'll definitely call Mom.
- She'll blame us

161
00:12:45.824 --> 00:12:49.026
She'll hop the next flight home,
and then she'll be in our faces.

162
00:12:49.095 --> 00:12:51.879
- I don't want Mom to come home.
- I don't either.

163
00:12:55.532 --> 00:12:57.585
- Easy.
- She's starting to stink.

164
00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:59.708
It's too soon.
It must be you.

165
00:12:59.777 --> 0:13:01.552
- Shut up.
- Be careful.

166
0:13:01.587 --> 0:13:04.196
- I got her.
- I mean my skateboard.

167
0:13:04.301 --> 0:13:06.144
You ran over my foot.

168
0:13:09.554 --> 00:13:11.225
Sure she's gonna fit?

169
00:13:11.294 --> 00:13:13.625
How should I know?
I've never done this before.

170
00:13:13.729 --> 00:13:15.818
Well, neither have I.

171
00:13:15.887 --> 00:13:18.322
I think we should
measure her first.

172
00:13:18.358 --> 00:13:21.663
- Let's hack off her head!
- Yeah!

173
00:13:21.732 --> 00:13:24.864
All right, go get that
metal tape measure out of the garage.

174
00:13:24.934 --> 00:13:28.170
Would you stop ordering us around?
You're not the baby-sitter.

175
00:13:28.204 --> 00:13:30.710
That's right, Kenny.
The baby-sitter is dead.

176
00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:32.832
Now just do it.

177
00:13:34.502 --> 00:13:37.146
We're saving the ambulance people
a trip, right?

178
00:13:37.251 --> 00:13:40.557
When they find her,
they'll take care of everything.

179
00:13:40.626 --> 00:13:42.714
And no one has to know
she was our sitter.

180
00:13:42.783 --> 00:13:47.515
She said she didn't
have any family, so this is--

181
00:13:47.585 --> 00:13:49.986
This is really
the decent thing to do.

182
0:14:01.677 --> 0:14:03.625
Hey, Bobby

183
0:14:09.784 --> 00:14:12.046
Now, who would do such a thing?

184
00:14:14.794 --> 00:14:16.847
It's the lifting that gets me.

185
00:14:22.832 --> 00:14:24,850
God, I feel terrible.

186
00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:28.330
I should've been nicer to her.

187
00:14:28.434 --> 00:14:30.766
I should've cooperated.

188
00:14:30.834 --> 00:14:34.349
Yeah. She was a great baby-sitter.

189
00:14:39.499 --> 00:14:42.769
- Where are you going?
- I'm going shopping for food.

190
00:14:42.873 --> 00:14:46.144
Yeah! Massive party supplies!
I got shotgun!

191
00:14:51.781 --> 00:14:53.833
You're taking Mrs. Sturak's car?

192
00:14:56.757 --> 00:14:59.297
Zach, life goes on.

193
00:14:59.366 --> 0:15:02.847
I mean, come on.
This car's a classic.

194
0:15:02.915 --> 0:15:06.847
I think that she'd
want it this way, don't you?

195
00:15:12.589 --> 00:15:14.606
How much did Mom leave us?

196
00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.279
There's no money in here.

197
00:15:20.347 --> 00:15:22.645
I saw Mom give it
to Mrs. Sturak.

198
00:15:22.749 --> 00:15:25.115
Well, she must've
taken it out.

199
00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:30.229
Holy shit!

200
00:15:42.269 --> 00:15:45.887
- Where is the damn thing?
- Shoot!

201
00:15:45.957 --> 00:15:47.835
Out of my way!

202
00:15:49.506 --> 00:15:52.150
Come on! Come on!

203
00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:54.864
- Maybe it's here.
- I looked in there already.

204
00:15:57.022 --> 00:15:59.248
- Find it?
- She must've had it on her.

205
00:15:59.283 --> 0:16:02.380
It's ours! Go back
and get it from the old hag!

206
0:16:02.449 --> 0:16:06.938
Yeah, right. We go and say, "Excuse me.
We left money on our dead baby-sitter."

207
0:16:07.042 --> 0:16:09.304
No way.

208
0:16:09.374 --> 00:16:12.505
- Who's gonna clean this place up?
- Not me.

209
00:16:15.115 --> 00:16:18.803
What are we gonna do for cash
for the next two months?

210
00:16:18.873 --> 00:16:20.926
How about a garage sale?

211
00:16:20.995 --> 00:16:24.161
- We live in the boonies.
- How about calling Dad?

212
00:16:24.267 --> 00:16:27.850
- Dad doesn't care.
- What about blackmailing Dad?

213
00:16:27.919 --> 00:16:30.112
What about donating blood?
They pay you.

214
00:16:30.181 --> 00:16:31.920
You have to be over 18

215
00:16:32.025 --> 00:16:34.426
There goes our great summer.

216
00:16:37.557 --> 00:16:39.123
Hello?

217
00:16:40.201 --> 00:16:41.733
Mom.

218
00:16:41.837 --> 00:16:43.507
Hi, Mom.

219
00:16:43.576 --> 00:16:46.152
How's Australia?

220
00:16:46.256 --> 00:16:48.796
Oh really? Great.

221
00:16:48.865 --> 00:16:52.067
Yeah, they're fine.
Everything's fine.

222
00:16:52.172 --> 00:16:54.119
Oh, Mrs. Sturak?

223
00:16:55.268 --> 00:16:58.608
Well, she's not here right now.

224
00:16:58.678 --> 0:17:00.243
She had a date.

225
0:17:00.347 --> 0:17:02.818
Some guy.
A mortician.

226
0:17:02.853 --> 0:17:06.401
Relax. I'm looking after things while
she's gone. Everything's gonna be fine.

227
0:17:06.472 --> 0:17:08.803
I love you too.
Okay.

228
0:17:08.907 --> 00:17:10.891
All right, bye.

229
00:17:13.187 --> 00:17:17.119
- You only got one bag of chips.
- We could only afford the necessities.

230
00:17:17.188 --> 00:17:20.668
This place is a crock.
We're never gonna make it two months.

231
00:17:20.703 --> 00:17:22.965
Man, I'm gonna
hole up at Lizard's.

232
00:17:22.999 --> 00:17:26.687
That's real brotherly.
Don't you have any pride?

233
00:17:28.044 --> 00:17:31.280
When our food's gone,
we can eat Elvis.

234
00:17:31.385 --> 00:17:33.055
What do you want from me?

235
00:17:33.124 --> 00:17:35.768
Would you like me to call Mom back?
'Cause I can.

236
00:17:36.639 --> 00:17:38.344
Want to call Aunt Pat...

237
00:17:38.414 --> 00:17:40.431
or go crawling to one of
Mom's semi-wretched friends?

238
00:17:42.414 --> 00:17:44.259
We don't need a warden.

239
00:17:44.363 --> 00:17:48.574
We don't need an adult around telling us
when to eat, sleep and vacuum, right?

240
00:17:48.643 --> 00:17:51.322
We could have a great summer.
We just gotta stick together.

241
00:17:51.391 --> 00:17:54.001
- Okay, yeah.
- Totally.

242
00:17:55.741 --> 00:17:58.037
Well, one of us
has to get a job.

243
00:17:58.107 --> 00:17:59.672
I'm not gonna.

244
00:17:59.742 --> 0:18:03.500
We don't have any choice.
We'll flip for it.

245
0:18:05.588 --> 0:18:07.919
Mama Celeste face up,
I go to work.

246
0:18:07.989 --> 00:18:12.755
Mama Celeste face down, you're sellin'
carnations on a freeway off-ramp.

247
00:18:17.975 --> 00:18:21.489
Okay, I'll get a job.
But you gotta stay and watch the kids.

248
00:18:21.558 --> 00:18:25.108
Hey, no problem, twisted sister.

249
00:18:25.177 --> 00:18:27.195
I can get a job
at a clothing store.

250
00:18:27.266 --> 00:18:29.423
They'll hire me in a second.
It'll be great.

251
00:18:46.297 --> 00:18:49.255
You gotta squeeze the fat
out of those burgers better.

252
00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:53.744
You're gettin' the hang of it.

253
00:18:59.346 --> 0:19:00.563
I'm Bryan.

254
0:19:01.851 --> 0:19:04.043
Swell, remember.

255
0:19:04.147 --> 0:19:06.235
Put on a happy face.

256
0:19:09.263 --> 00:19:11.315
Did he just finish
reading Dianetics?

257
00:19:11.385 --> 00:19:13.751
- No. He's just on helium.
- Bryan.

258
00:19:15.004 --> 00:19:16.987
Another happy delivery.

259
00:19:19.492 --> 00:19:23.667
You gotta put chili on those Clown Dogs,
and keep it movin'.

260
00:19:38.107 --> 00:19:40.925
This is great, man.
My sister's working.

261
00:19:41.029 --> 00:19:43.117
There's no one around
nagging me anymore.

262
00:19:43.153 --> 00:19:45.796
- I'm born free.
- Hey, dude.

263
00:19:45.902 --> 00:19:49.450
- Let's go to the Guitar Center.
- Wait, guys.

264
00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:52.617
We seem to be experiencing
a negative cash-flow problem here.

265
00:19:52.686 --> 00:19:56.583
Let's go to my place.
I'll rip off my mom's MasterCard again.

266
00:19:56.652 --> 00:19:59.263
Master the possibilities.

267
0:20:00.167 --> 0:20:01.733
I gotta get out of here.

268
0:20:01.837 --> 0:20:06,639
My dad is pissed about my report card.
I gotta kiss ass a couple more days.

269
0:20:08.761 --> 00:20:10.849
You know what, guys?

270
00:20:10.884 --> 00:20:15.373
We keep this up, we're never
gettin' out of school, man.

271
00:20:17.216 --> 00:20:18.190
Far out!

272
00:20:19.409 --> 00:20:21.566
Rock and roll!

273
0:21:00.153 --> 0:21:02.345
- Thanks.
- Sure.

274
0:21:08.330 --> 00:21:12.957
- Did you have a lot of deliveries?
- Yeah. I'm the stork of fast food.

275
00:21:12.993 --> 00:21:16,090
You're lucky.
It's better than being here.

276
00:21:16.123 --> 00:21:17.899
Yeah, I guess.

277
00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:28.441
God, this place is so disgusting.

278
00:21:28.476 --> 00:21:31.433
- How can you stand it?
- Just try to hang with it.

279
00:21:37.523 --> 00:21:39.367
Shit.

280
00:21:39.401 --> 00:21:41.906
- Gross.
- Not your dream job, huh?

281
00:21:41.976 --> 00:21:44.934
You got that right.

282
00:21:45.038 --> 00:21:47.021
You'd think I woke up
this morning and thought...

283
00:21:47.126 --> 00:21:49.909
"Gee, I'd love to scrub fat vats.

284
00:21:49.979 --> 00:21:52.171
I'd love to smile
and work with raw meat."

285
00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:54.536
At least it gives you
some extra cash.

286
00:21:54.606 --> 00:21:57.390
I'm not working at the big top from hell
for pocket money.

287
00:21:57.460 --> 0:22:00.209
My mom's out of town, and I have
my brothers and sister to feed.

288
0:22:00.278 --> 0:22:04.384
And no one's gonna hire a teenager
to do anything that isn't disgusting.

289
0:22:04.454 --> 0:22:06.994
Why can't I just get a job
at some nice, clean office?

290
0:22:07.098 --> 0:22:08.560
Why don't you just quit?

291
00:22:10.926 --> 00:22:14.022
How's the scrubba-dub-dubbing going?

292
00:22:14.057 --> 00:22:16.423
You're almost
doing that correctly...

293
00:22:16.527 --> 00:22:19.241
but you forgot
one very big thing.

294
00:22:19.311 --> 00:22:22.024
- Not enough cleanser?
- Nope.

295
00:22:22.094 --> 00:22:24.599
Forgot to put on a happy face.

296
00:22:24.704 --> 00:22:29.540
Next, you get to scrape the spitballs
off the drive-through window...

297
00:22:29.611 --> 00:22:32.464
with a really fun squeegee!

298
00:22:38.204 --> 00:22:39.700
See, Mr. Eggs

299
00:22:39.805 --> 00:22:42.414
Finish the Happy Fat vats yourself.

300
00:22:48.887 --> 00:22:50.940
thanks for your advice

301
00:22:50.974 --> 00:22:53.201
Maybe I'll see you around.

302
00:23:33.597 --> 00:23:36.451
You're just copying it
right out of the book?

303
00:23:36.521 --> 00:23:41.496
I changed the name, and I'm adding
some glamorous fashion stuff.

304
00:24:38.386 --> 00:24:42.004
Spell that a little faster.
Your number?

305
00:24:42.108 --> 00:24:43.604
Excuse me.

306
00:24:43.639 --> 00:24:47.294
- I'm applying for the receptionist job.
- Hold.

307
00:24:47.398 --> 00:24:50.389
Reception.
I can't right now.

308
00:24:50.495 --> 00:24:53.452
I have to stay and redirect all the
incompetents who are coming up here...

309
00:24:53.486 --> 00:24:56.165
instead of going straight to Personnel
like they are supposed to.

310
00:24:56.236 --> 00:24:59.888
All right, all right.
I'll be right there.

311
00:24:59.993 --> 0:25:02.533
You'll have about 1 2 seconds.

312
0:25:06.291 --> 00:25:10.431
You are supposed to go down
to Personnel.

313
00:25:10.466 --> 00:25:11.823
That is on...

314
00:25:11.928 --> 00:25:14,432
the first floor.

315
00:25:15.163 --> 00:25:18.643
There is a great big sign
that says...

316
00:25:20.174 --> 00:25:22.401
"Personnel.

317
00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:24.071
Do you ...

318
00:25:24.105 --> 00:25:26.889
understand?

319
00:25:34.683 --> 00:25:37.571
Where's Carolyn?
Mousy-brown hair, gives you a headache?

320
00:25:37.641 --> 00:25:40.876
- Talks like she's chewing her face?
- That's her.

321
00:25:40.946 --> 00:25:44.634
She'll be back in a few seconds.
I'm here for the receptionist job.

322
00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:47.070
- Is this your résumé?
- Yeah.

323
00:25:52.603 --> 00:25:54.099
Wow.

324
00:25:54.133 --> 00:25:56.047
Very impressive.

325
00:25:57.160 --> 0:26:00.501
- This is fabulous.
- Thank you.

326
0:26:02.102 --> 0:26:05.651
Listen. They're looking for
a receptionist to replace Carolyn.

327
0:26:05.685 --> 0:26:09.826
She's supposed to move up to be
my executive administrative assistant.

328
0:26:09.862 --> 00:26:13.236
I can't stand her, so do me a favor.
You be my assistant.

329
00:26:13.237 --> 00:26:15.671
I'll just tell 'em
I hired outside the company.

330
00:26:15.742 --> 00:26:17.446
What about
the receptionist job?

331
00:26:17.550 --> 00:26:21.274
What, are you burnt out?
You wanna take a step down?

332
00:26:21.344 --> 00:26:23.745
Well, I won't let you.
I need you.

333
00:26:23.849 --> 00:26:27.606
And besides, you're so overqualified
for entry level, it's ridiculous.

334
00:26:27.676 --> 00:26:30.634
For God's sakes,
you're a Vassar gal.

335
00:26:30.738 --> 00:26:33.870
And you'd much rather
be my executive assistant.

336
00:26:33.904 --> 00:26:35.713
Please say yes.

337
00:26:36.862 --> 00:26:38.289
Yes!

338
00:26:38.323 --> 00:26:40.481
We're up here with
the other vice presidents...

339
00:26:40.585 --> 00:26:42.638
our executive staff
and our advertising people.

340
00:26:42.742 --> 00:26:44.517
Downstairs are the designers...

341
00:26:44.621 --> 00:26:47.404
our warehouse and showroom,
and our manufacturing and assembly line.

342
00:26:47.508 --> 00:26:50.501
You graduated six, years ago,
so you're 27, 28?

343
00:26:50.571 --> 00:26:52.763
- Yeah.
- You don't look it.

344
00:26:52.832 --> 00:26:56.765
My last assistant was only 23
and still wet behind the ears.

345
00:26:58.261 --> 0:27:01.218
Okay, this is your office.
Mine's through the archway.

346
0:27:01.288 --> 0:27:03.618
These are your things.
Your Rolodex.

347
0:27:03.724 --> 0:27:05.846
There's your computer,
WordStar and Lotus.

348
0:27:05.915 --> 0:27:08.525
There's your mouse.
The refrigerator's over there.

349
0:27:08.560 --> 00:27:11.692
Just leave a list for Carolyn.
She'll stock it for you, okay?

350
00:27:11.726 --> 00:27:14.405
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, great.

351
00:27:14.475 --> 00:27:18.163
So, these are my things.
When do I get paid?

352
00:27:19.521 --> 00:27:22.582
First and fifteenth of every month.
Is that it?

353
00:27:23.487 --> 00:27:26.062
Great.
Gus, hi.

354
00:27:27.211 --> 00:27:29.715
This is my new administrative
assistant, Sue Ellen.

355
00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:33.473
Sue Ellen, this is Gus Brandon,
vice president of marketing.

356
00:27:33.543 --> 00:27:36.640
- And he serves me breakfast in bed.
- Only when she deserves it.

357
00:27:37.857 --> 00:27:39.841
- Nice to meet you.
- Good morning.

358
00:27:41.059 --> 00:27:43.355
- See you for lunch?
- I'll let you know.

359
00:27:43.425 --> 00:27:46.765
I'm interfacing with New York at 3:00,
and I have a report due today.

360
00:27:46.834 --> 00:27:48.435
We'll play it by ear.

361
00:27:48.504 --> 00:27:50.174
Talk to you later

362
00:27:50.278 --> 00:27:53.271
Bye.
Sue Ellen, right?

363
0:28:00.195 --> 0:28:03.467
Have a great weekend.
See you Monday, 8:00 sharp.

364
0:28:06.875 --> 00:28:10,425
By the way, I'm Rose Lindsay,
Senior Vice President of Operations

365
00:28:10,494 --> 00:28:14.427
And when Beatrice from Personnel calls,
she's a really pushy broad.

366
00:28:14.495 --> 00:28:19.124
Just tell her I hired you. And find out
about your medical benefits and pension.

366
00:28:14.495 --> 00:28:19.124
Oh, one more thing,
and this is so important.

367
00:28:19.228 --> 00:28:23.021
Oh, another thing, and this is very important.

368
00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:26.326
Whenever we're not alone or I'm
on the phone and I askyou something--

369
00:28:26.396 --> 00:28:29.841
doesn't matter what it is--
you always say...

370
00:28:29.945 --> 00:28:32.867
"I'm right on top of that, Rose."

371
00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:37.321
- Welcome aboard, sweetie.
- Thank you.

372
00:28:48.385 --> 00:28:50.056
I'm gonna get you, sucker!

373
00:28:57.015 --> 00:28:58.790
I need more money

374
00:28:59.938 --> 0:29:01.956
Get out of here.

375
0:29:02.061 --> 0:29:04.600
Anyway, I have my own office...

376
0:29:04.669 --> 0:29:08.150
and this fridge stocked with Diet Sprite
and Tab, and I have a great view.

377
0:29:08.219 --> 0:29:09.610
what is the job?

378
0:29:09.681 --> 00:29:12.569
I am the executive
administrative assistant...

379
00:29:12.638 --> 00:29:15,074
to the senior vice president
of operations.

380
00:29:15.144 --> 00:29:17.961
- What the hell is that?
- I don't know.

381
00:29:18.031 --> 00:29:19.701
What are they gonna pay you?

382
00:29:19.771 --> 00:29:23.146
$37,500 a year.

383
00:29:23.251 --> 00:29:24.886
No way!

384
00:29:24.955 --> 00:29:28.365
Shit! You're gonna drown! Choke!

385
00:29:28.469 --> 00:29:31.322
I'm a fast learner.
I'll catch on.

386
00:29:31.427 --> 00:29:33.062
You're never gonna
get to the beach.

387
00:29:33.098 --> 00:29:36.264
Yeah, but who cares?
I'm a career woman now.

388
00:29:36.332 --> 00:29:40.508
Better bring some bucks home tomorrow
'cause we're totally out of food.

389
00:29:40.613 --> 00:29:43.571
Wait a minute.
I don't get paid for two weeks.

390
00:29:43.604 --> 00:29:47,606
Help. We need money.
We have no food.

391
00:29:47.676 --> 00:29:50.285
- Are those drag queens?
- What's a drag queen?

392
00:29:50.356 --> 00:29:52.442
- That's our car!
- Let's go!

393
00:29:54.113 --> 00:29:56.584
What are you queens
doin' in our car?

394
00:29:58.567 --> 0:30:00.412
Step on it!

395
0:30:00.481 --> 0:30:01.942
Liza?

396
00:30:11.197 --> 00:30:13.563
Shit! I loved that car.

397
00:30:13,633 --> 00:30:15.024
Call the cops.

398
00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:17.738
What are we gonna say?
Liza Minnelli stole our Buick?

399
00:30:17.808 --> 00:30:20.348
- It wasn't even our Buick.
- This sucks.

400
00:30:20.418 --> 00:30:23.236
- Now how are we gonna get home?
- I miss Mommy.

401
00:30:27.063 --> 00:30:30.578
- Call Nicole.
- All of my friends are in Europe.

402
00:30:32.109 --> 00:30:35.380
- What about Lizard or Hellhound?
- We don't have any money.

403
00:30:35.449 --> 00:30:38.094
- You'd have to bribe them?
- Yeah.

404
00:30:39.102 --> 00:30:41.120
Who else do you know that drives?

405
00:30:58.900 --> 0:31:01.023
Who's the bozo?

406
0:31:02.345 --> 0:31:05.304
Hi. Thanks for coming.

407
0:31:05.408 --> 0:31:08.852
No problem.
I kind of like being a hero.

408
0:31:08 956 --> 00:31:11.496
Me and my trusty steed.

409
00:31:13.654 --> 00:31:16.576
Just get in the car.
Come on. Come on.

410
00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:27.990
My mom doesn't want us
to use her Volvo while she's away.

411
00:31:28.094 --> 00:31:29.972
Can't believe my friends
ditched us like that.

412
00:31:30.042 --> 00:31:34.008
But wasn't that your car I saw
at Clown Dog? Whitewalls and stuff?

413
00:31:34.113 --> 00:31:36.548
Yeah, well,
it was kind of a loaner.

414
00:31:36.653 --> 00:31:39.227
Swell, what are you doing?
Come on!

415
00:31:39.298 --> 00:31:41.838
Hold on.
I'll be there in a minute.

416
00:31:43.438 --> 00:31:46.709
I'm sorry if I acted like a bitch
the other night at Clown Dog...

417
00:31:46.743 --> 00:31:48.762
just walking out like that.

418
00:31:48.866 --> 00:31:51.545
- It cracked Mr. Egg when you left.
- Really?

419
00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:53.668
Did you get stuck
finishing the fat vats?

420
00:31:53.702 --> 00:31:56.068
Lard is my life.

421
00:31:56.172 --> 00:31:59.130
At least until college

422
00:31:59.165 --> 0:32:01.809
- I'm glad you called me, really.
- Yeah, me too.

423
0:32:01.880 --> 0:32:03.584
Could you hurry up?

424
0:32:03.654 --> 0:32:07.620
Melissa and Zach are beating
each other up over the last Sno Ball.

425
0:32:07.725 --> 0:32:09.708
It's the last food we got.

426
00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:13.605
- You guys really out of food?
- No.

427
00:32:13.675 --> 00:32:16.563
They're just being obnoxious.
I'm going to the market in the morning

428
00:32:16.632 --> 00:32:20.947
I've got some extra leftovers from my
dinner deliveries, so ifyou want 'em--

429
00:32:22.304 --> 00:32:24.495
No, that's okay.

430
00:32:27.036 --> 00:32:29.541
Maybe we'll take 'em.
Thanks.

431
00:32:29.575 --> 00:32:30.585
Sure.

432
00:32:31.837 --> 00:32:34.377
You wanna go to the beach
and watch the grunion run Monday night?

433
00:32:34.413 --> 00:32:36.222
You mean, a date?

434
00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:40.953
Yeah. I'm free.
I gotta check with the grunion, but--

435
00:32:42.345 --> 00:32:43.842
Yeah, a date.

436
00:32:43.911 --> 00:32:46.347
Yeah, sure.
I like grunion.

437
00:32:46.416 --> 00:32:47.565
Me too.

438
00:32:47.634 --> 00:32:49.861
Thanks again.

439
00:32:49.896 --> 00:32:51.601
Bye

440
00:32:53.584 --> 00:32:56.855
We have unhealthful air. quality today
thr.oughout the LosAngeles basin.

441
00:32:56.925 --> 0:33:01.274
KDJI news time is 5:30 A.M.,

443
00:33:32.902 --> 00:33:35.060
- You guys are up already?
- It's summer.

444
00:33:35.130 --> 00:33:36.903
- I'm a morning person.
- I'm hungry.

445
00:33:36.974 --> 00:33:39.165
What do you guys
want for breakfast?

446
00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:41.114
- A steak.
- Cheese omelet.

447
00:33:41.184 --> 00:33:43.619

- Okay.

448
00:33:54.301 --> 00:33:56.284
Breakfast is served..

449
00:34:15.735 --> 00:34:17,787
Excuse me.
Where do you think you're going?

450
00:34:19.736 --> 00:34:22.902
To Rose Lindsey's office.
I work for her now.

451
00:34:24.537 --> 00:34:25.547
You?

452
00:34:25.616 --> 00:34:27.321
Hi. I'm Sue Ellen.

453
00:34:29.791 --> 00:34:32.924
Well, don't bother
getting too settled in, hmm?

454
00:34:37.551 --> 00:34:41.518
Yes, we have temporarily cut back
on quality fabrics...

455
00:34:41.587 --> 00:34:44.092
due to a receding profit margin.

456
00:34:44.161 --> 00:34:47.502
I understand. Anytime you
want to come back to G.A.W.

457
00:34:48.267 --> 00:34:50.669
Thank you for
telling me personally.

458
00:34:50.773 --> 00:34:54.078
Bye-bye. Would you all
please excuse us for a minute?

459
00:34:54.113 --> 00:34:56.131
- Sure, Rose.
- Fabulous.

460
00:34:57.905 --> 0:35:01.768
Oh, Lord.
We just lost another account.

461
0:35:01.873 --> 0:35:04.586
Costs are up, overhead is high,
sales are down.

462
0:35:04 657 --> 0:35:09.319
New York's gonna be none too thrilled
with their industrial uniform division.

463
00:35:10.084 --> 00:35:12,868
This is our new spring line.

464
00:35:12.972 --> 00:35:15.894
- Lovely, isn't it?
- Yeah, lovely.

465
00:35:15.929 --> 00:35:18.922
You know, I thought
we made designer clothes.

466
00:35:20.418 --> 00:35:22.436
Sue Ellen, no.

467
00:35:22.506 --> 00:35:25.359
We're in the bowels
of the fashion industry.

468
00:35:25.394 --> 00:35:29.778
General Apparel West is one of
32 subdivisions of ChemTech America...

469
00:35:29.847 --> 00:35:32.004
one of our nation's
leading chemical corporations.

470
00:35:32.109 --> 00:35:34.719
This is our design area...

471
00:35:34.823 --> 00:35:38.860
and this is Franklin,
our head designer.

472
00:35:40.182 --> 00:35:42.548
You'll be verifying his purchase orders
pending my approval...

473
00:35:42.582 --> 00:35:44.635
and consulting with him
on budget estimates.

474
00:35:45.505 --> 00:35:48.219
- Bye, Franklin.
- Bye.

475
00:35:48.289 --> 00:35:51.907
You'll also be coordinating our sales,
manufacturing and advertising people.

476
00:35:52.011 --> 00:35:53.994
I'm gonna need
biweekly reports from you.

477
00:35:54.099 --> 00:35:56.604
Basically, you're the hub
of our communication network.

478
00:35:56.639 --> 00:35:57.649
Hub

479
0:36:06.173 --> 0:36:08.991
- I hate you.
- Sue Ellen?

480
0:36:09.061 --> 00:36:12.574
Start getting updated reports from the
department heads and coordinating them.

481
00:36:12.610 --> 00:36:15.290
You can access the format
on the C-drive

482
00:36:15.359 --> 00:36:18.699
Until you lay it out on a spreadsheet,
the market analysis is too amorphous.

483
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:24.128
The Q.E.D. report. I've made notes.
See ifyou can make a dent after lunch.

484
00:36:24.161 --> 00:36:27.954
And fax this to New York for me.
Don't feel overwhelmed.

485
00:36:28.024 --> 00:36:30.042
Just do one thing at a time.

486
00:36:37.766 --> 00:36:39.819
Looking for something,
Sue Ellen?

487
00:36:39.855 --> 00:36:43.821
Yeah.
Where did that come from?

488
00:36:43.856 --> 00:36:46.222
I had it delivered.
Do you have a problem with that?

489
00:36:46.326 --> 00:36:50.119
No. I was just wondering why they would
come all this way to bring a chili dog.

490
00:36:50.188 --> 00:36:52.832
My little brother
drives the delivery van.

491
00:36:52.902 --> 00:36:54.990
Occasionally...

492
00:36:55.025 --> 00:36:58.539
he goes out of his way
to bring me lunch, all right?

493
00:36:58.574 --> 0:37:01.602
That's nice.
Your little brother.

494
0:37:02.854 --> 0:37:05.080
I need to fax something.
How would I do that?

495
0:37:05.150 --> 0:37:06.785
Gosh, Sue Ellen.

496
0:37:06.889 --> 00:37:11,030
Being an executive administrative
assistant, you can figure that out.

497
00:37:29.193 --> 00:37:30.759
Hello?

498
00:37:39.144 --> 00:37:40.988
Hi. Are you a temp?

499
00:37:41.093 --> 00:37:44.676
No. I'm Sue Ellen.
I work for Rose.

500
00:37:44.747 --> 00:37:46,800
Hi. I'm Cathy.

501
00:37:46.833 --> 00:37:49.966
So you're Rose's new
executive administrative assistant.

502
00:37:50.035 --> 00:37:52.958
Well, congratulations.

503
00:37:53.062 --> 00:37:55.394
I submitted my résumé,
but it wasn't good enough.

504
00:37:55.463 --> 00:37:58.664
Wow. Working with Rose
must be so neat.

505
00:37:58.768 --> 0:38:01.552
Am I cutting in front of you?
Are you faxing?

506
0:38:01.656 --> 0:38:05.310
No, I'm still organizing
my spreadsheet...

507
0:38:05.380 --> 0:38:08.511
and my projections--
amorphous hub stuff.

508
0:38:08.616 --> 00:38:10,669
Oh, right.

509
00:38:19.367 --> 00:38:23.055
So anyway, I'm Fred Kibrick's
secretary over in sales.

510
00:38:23.125 --> 00:38:25.178
It has been really slow.

511
00:38:25.212 --> 00:38:29.561
- Gosh! You're swamped!
- Yeah.

512
00:38:29.631 --> 00:38:31.684
I'm a whiz on the computer...

513
00:38:31.754 --> 00:38:34.433
so ifyou ever have
anything for me, just ask.

514
00:38:34.503 --> 00:38:38.399
Ifyou want-- Are you familiar
with the Q.E.D. report?

515
00:38:39.339 --> 00:38:41.601
Oh, wow.
Really?

516
00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:45.742
- Yeah, go ahead, really.
- Thank you.

517
00:38:49.082 --> 00:38:52.143
Oh, and don't feel overwhelmed.
Just do one thing at a time.

518
00:38:52.248 --> 00:38:53.291
Right

519
0:39:03.174 --> 0:39:05.261
- Hello?
- How's it goin'?

520
0:39:05.331 --> 0:39:07.071
what do you mean?

521
0:39:07.175 --> 0:39:09.228
How are you?
Are the kids okay?

522
0:39:09.297 --> 00:39:13.369
No. I tied 'em to a red-ant hill.
Did you get some money?

523
00:39:13.473 --> 00:39:17.231
Hey, who are you?
Where's that other broad, Mona?

524
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:19.319
Not yet.
There's a problem.

525
00:39:19.388 --> 00:39:21.440
What'd they do? Fire you?

526
00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:23.980
I'm Sue Ellen. I work for Rose.
Can I help you?

527
00:39:24.050 --> 00:39:26.486
I need a copy of
the Bob's Big Boy account figures.

528
00:39:26.556 --> 00:39:29.617
What ar.eyou gonna do?
This Clown Dog shit's gone, man.

529
00:39:29.687 --> 00:39:33.167
What do you want me to do?
We have a receding profit margin.

530
00:39:33.237 --> 00:39:35.289
Yo, Gidget,
could you get on it?

531
00:39:35.324 --> 00:39:37.900
I can't right now.
I'm on an important phone call.

532
00:39:38.004 --> 00:39:40.090
If you didn't get the money,
why'd you call?

533
00:39:40.126 --> 00:39:43.257
Hey, look.
I don't have all day.

534
00:39:43.291 --> 00:39:44.405
Hold on.

535
00:39:45.936 --> 00:39:48.024
What is your name,
and what do you do here?

536
00:39:48.093 --> 00:39:51.817
I'm Bruce.
I'm head inventory clerk. Why?

537
00:39:51.852 --> 00:39:55.957
Well, Bruce, I'm the executive level
administrative assistant...

538
00:39:56.062 --> 00:39:59.158
and when I get those figures ready,
I'll give you a buzz...

539
00:39:59.193 --> 0:40:02.117
and you can run up here
and fetch them, all right?

540
0:40:04.134 --> 0:40:06.152
Yeah, sure.

541
0:40:07.161 --> 0:40:09.353
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

542
00:40:12.171 --> 00:40:15.547
- I just called to say hi.
- Aren't you busy in your career?

543
00:40:15.615 --> 00:40:19.861
I'm in between important meetings.
I'm so sorry I disturbed you, Kenny.

544
00:40:19.966 --> 00:40:21.740
You did. We're busy.

545
00:40:21.845 --> 00:40:24.489
- Fine! Screw you!
- Up yours!

546
00:40:26.159 --> 00:40:27.690
Bitch.

547
00:40:27.724 --> 00:40:29.291
Such a punk.

548
00:40:33.814 --> 00:40:35.553
What?

549
00:40:38.754 --> 00:40:41.538
How are you doin', Mom? Yeah.

550
00:40:41.573 --> 00:40:43.939
No, everything's great.

551
00:40:44.008 --> 00:40:47.558
No, Mrs. Sturak's not here. She--

552
00:40:47.662 --> 00:40:49.541
She went to the yarn store.

553
00:40:49.610 --> 00:40:52.812
Yeah, she's crocheting this
massive doily for the couch.

554
00:40:55.038 --> 00:40:58.448
I-- I gotta go, Mom.

555
0:41:00.362 --> 0:41:03.772
Hey, babe.
Who's the void in Lindsey's office?

556
0:41:04.886 --> 0:41:07.286
She applied for
the receptionist job.

557
0:41:07,390 --> 00:41:11.358
Suddenly she's an executive?
I don't get it.

558
00:41:11,392 --> 00:41:13.167
- Ready.
- Genie.

559
00:41:13.271 --> 00:41:15.324
- Where you park your. car..
- Garage?

560
00:41:15.393 --> 00:41:17.620
-A horse runs at a--
- Gallop.

561
00:41:17.690 --> 00:41:21.414
- You go to the supermarket--
- Groceries.

562
00:41:21.482 --> 00:41:25.206
- Do you ever go outside?
- Nah. No TV.

563
00:41:25.276 --> 00:41:27.084
No prizes.

564
00:41:27.155 --> 00:41:30.216
All right.
Gentlemen, you've got it.

565
00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:31.817
Who does not want ...

566
00:41:31.921 --> 00:41:33.591
When you're gonna do a cake...

567
00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:36.375
you really have to have
a battle plan all ready...

568
00:41:36.444 --> 00:41:40.306
so that when you start in,
you can just go right through the cake.

569
00:41:40.341 --> 00:41:43.647
You don't wanna go out and play croquet
in the middle, for instance.

570
00:41:44.517 --> 00:41:47.788
I'll give her the message.
Bye.

571
00:41:47.892 --> 00:41:49.945
Cathy, thank you so much.

572
00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:53.668
No, Sue Ellen.
Thank you. Really.

573
00:41:57.634 --> 0:42:00.487
Why don't you call Siam Mania
and order in lunch for us.

574
0:42:00.557 --> 0:42:03.793
- The naked shrimp is to die from.
- Right. Yum.

575
0:42:03.862 --> 0:42:05.915
They'll deliver.
Pay out of petty cash.

576
0:42:05.951 --> 00:42:10.126
- Petty cash?
- Cash box is in your locked drawer.

577
00:42:10.195 --> 00:42:12.213
There should be plenty.

578
00:42:12.283 --> 00:42:15.032
You can cash personal checks
for our employees.

579
00:42:15.136 --> 00:42:19.833
We work such hellish hours here,
no one has time to go to the bank.

580
00:42:19.938 --> 00:42:22.896
Guard it with your life, and leave
receipts for whateveryou take.

581
00:42:22.965 --> 00:42:25.191
I'll authorize it, okay?

582
00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:28.079
is this for me?

583
00:42:34.517 --> 00:42:35.839
This is exquisite.

584
00:42:36.987 --> 00:42:38.623
We're so in sync.

585
00:43:28.205 --> 00:43:30.571
- Hi, Zach.
- Hi.

586
00:43:34.085 --> 00:43:35.929
What's wrong?

587
00:43:35.999 --> 00:43:38.539
Me and Cynthia
are having some problems.

588
00:43:39.791 --> 00:43:42.193
I think she likes Jacob better.

589
00:43:42.227 --> 00:43:44.315
Maybe she's trying
to make you jealous.

590
00:43:44.349 --> 00:43:45.985
Maybe.

591
00:43:47.099 --> 00:43:48.908
Oh, here.

592
00:43:48.942 --> 00:43:51.343
There's an article on game playing.

593
00:43:51.447 --> 00:43:54.022
I really think
you should read it.

594
00:43:54.092 --> 00:43:57.085
Take the quiz afterward, okay??

595
00:43:57.119 --> 00:43:59.764
Check it out.
Elvis, I'm gonna take you higher.

596
00:44:22.728 --> 00:44:25.128
Look at his eyes.
Poor dude

597
00:44:28.399 --> 00:44:30.453
Kenny, could you
turn the music down?

598
00:44:30.487 --> 00:44:32.749
- Kenny.
- What?

599
00:44:34.279 --> 00:44:36.785
I have been working.
I've had a very rough day.

600
00:44:36.855 --> 00:44:40.751
- Could you turn the music down?
- It's down, cave lady.

601
00:44:43.083 --> 00:44:46.006
Kenny, why don't you save
your last three brain cells?

602
00:44:46.075 --> 00:44:48.511
- What ifyou need them?
- I won't.

603
00:44:51.330 --> 00:44:53.765
That's right.
You'll never need them.

604
00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:57.732
There's always gonna be some jerk around
stupid enough to take care of you.

605
00:44:57.766 --> 0:45:00.863
- what is your problem?
- Yeah.

606
0:45:00.933 --> 0:45:03.021
You couldn't even
mow the lawn today

607
0:45:03.090 --> 0:45:05.073
You're worthless.

608
0:45:05.108 --> 0:45:09.283
I am doing everything,
and I'm trying to get ready for a date.

609
0:45:09 354 --> 00:45:13.251
When are you gonna start helping me,
you lazy little punk?

610
00:45:16.626 --> 00:45:19.061
P.M.S. City, man.

611
00:45:44.044 --> 00:45:46.410
God, that's cold!

612
00:45:46.479 --> 00:45:49.437
So, Bryan,
when do the grunion run?

613
00:45:49.541 --> 00:45:51.176
Right about now.

614
00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:55.073
They get washed up here on the shore
after the highest tide of the full moon.

615
00:45:55.144 --> 00:45:57.439
Or the new moon

616
00:45:57.544 --> 0:46:01.510
Anyway, the girl grunion,
she comes and lays her eggs in the sand.

617
0:46:01.545 --> 0:46:03.668
Then the guy grunion comes
and fertilizes them.

618
0:46:03.738 --> 0:46:07.043
So they don't, like,
do it together?

619
0:46:07.843 --> 0:46:09,479
Not like us

620
00:46:13.411 --> 00:46:15.985
- I mean, like humans.
- Oh

621
00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:18.942
You wanna go and watch for 'em?
It happens really fast.

622
00:46:18.978 --> 00:46:20.439
Sure.

623
00:46:20.543 --> 00:46:23.605
You goin' to college?
What do you wanna do?

624
00:46:23.675 --> 00:46:26.424
Oh, God.
I don't know.

625
00:46:26.528 --> 00:46:29.242
I'm supposed to register
at City College.

626
00:46:29.311 --> 00:46:33.035
You know, maybe take some
fashion design classes or something.

627
00:46:33.104 --> 00:46:36.583
- What about you?
- My parents want me to go to UCSD.

628
00:46:36.653 --> 00:46:39.088
They have a really good
oceanography program there.

629
00:46:39.158 --> 00:46:42.568
- That's cool.
- Yeah, but I'm not so sure.

630
00:46:42.672 --> 00:46:45.735
I figure I'll keep
savin' up for it anyway.

631
00:46:45.839 --> 00:46:49.805
That's the only reason I'm still
at Clown Dog after nine months.

632
00:46:49.875 --> 00:46:51.336
It's funny.

633
00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:55.442
I always thought that my parents
had this big college fund for me.

634
00:46:55.477 --> 00:46:57.565
Yes. Me too

635
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:00.766
But I guess that's only on
the savings and loan commercials

636
0:47:00.835 --> 0:47:04.384
It's like, I don't know if
I want oceanography to be my life.

637
0:47:04.489 --> 0:47:07.343
I mean, I love it.
Love it.

638
0:47:07.447 --> 00:47:10.126
But it's like once you decide
on something, it's all planned out.

639
00:47:10.196 --> 00:47:15.379
It's like all of a sudden,
anything you do means that's your life.

640
00:47:15.414 --> 00:47:17.467
I'm not sure what
I want my life to be yet.

641
00:47:17.502 --> 00:47:20.737
And then you're stuck in this plan
because you decided, you know?

642
00:47:20.842 --> 00:47:23.382
And then you're old or older.

643
00:47:23.417 --> 00:47:26.305
I don't know.
I guess I'm just stalling.

644
00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:32.499
What?

645
00:47:33.717 --> 00:47:37.196
Nothing.
I just know what you mean.

646
00:47:39.179 --> 00:47:40.919
It's always ...

647
00:47:41.023 --> 00:47:44.119
Yeah. I hate this part.

648
00:47:44.155 --> 00:47:48.574
I mean, I like this part, but--
Oh, God.

649
00:47:48.642 --> 00:47:51.358
It's okay. Come here.

650
00:47:55.394 --> 00:47:58.003
Forget it.
I ruined the moment.

651
00:47:58.038 --> 0:48:00.404
No, I ruined it
because I talked about it.

652
0:48:00.508 --> 0:48:04.405
When you talk, you ruin it.
You can't talk unless you stop.

653
00:48:29.969 --> 00:48:31.742
Kenny, wake up.

654
00:48:31.777 --> 00:48:34.317
The food that I bought yesterday
is already gone.

655
00:48:34.387 --> 00:48:38.980
I was entertaining some friends
last night, and we had the munchies.

656
00:48:39.084 --> 00:48:41.728
I am not working
to feed your scummy friends.

657
00:48:41.833 --> 00:48:44.025
You're a career woman now.

658
00:48:44.130 --> 00:48:48.305
- We can afford to be hospitable.
- Whatever. Here.

659
00:48:48.375 --> 00:48:52.028
- Go buy some more food for the kids.
- You got paid!

660
00:48:52.133 --> 00:48:55.889
Well, not exactly.
It's office money, petty cash.

661
00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:59.577
My paycheck's gonna be over $1,000.
I'll be able to put it back.

662
00:48:59.682 --> 0:49:01.388
I gotta go.

663
0:49:03.058 --> 0:49:05.633
And I don't want your friends
hanging around my house.

664
0:49:05.737 --> 0:49:08.868
Mow the lawn today,
and don't forget the dishes. Bye.

665
00:49:12.104 --> 00:49:13.914
I'll do the dishes.

666
00:49:17.706 --> 00:49:19.898
- Yes, Scott!
- One more.

667
00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:25.187
- Pull!
- There!

668
00:49:26.370 --> 00:49:28.075
Dishes are done, man.

669
00:49:28.180 --> 00:49:30.163
Cleans 'em down to a shine.

670
00:49:39.557 --> 00:49:41.714
- Hi, Franklin.
- Hi.

671
00:49:41.819 --> 00:49:45.368
Sue Ellen, I need
to get this P.O. approved.

672
00:49:45.402 --> 00:49:48.952
- I got a good deal on some material.
- Good.

673
00:49:55.458 --> 00:49:58.729
I was just gonna see if Rose wanted
to grab some lunch in the cafeteria.

674
00:49:58.834 --> 0:50:02.417
Well, you just missed her.
Sorry.

675
0:50:05.027 --> 0:50:063.84
hungry?

676
00:50:15.849 --> 00:50:17.936
- Good afternoon.
- Thank you

677
00:50:28.235 --> 00:50:30.741
Thank you.

678
00:50:30.775 --> 00:50:33.941
So, how long have you
and Rose been together?

679
00:50:34.046 --> 00:50:37.004
We're not really together.
A few months.

680
00:50:37.037 --> 00:50:39.926
We agreed we're not exclusive

681
00:50:39.961 --> 00:50:42.153
I date other women.

682
00:50:42.257 --> 00:50:45.040
Dinner, movies,
jazz clubs, the symphony.

683
00:50:45.111 --> 00:50:48.903
- Do you like classical music?
- I played cello in high school

684
00:50:54.645 --> 00:50:56.836
Do people always tell you
How young you look young?

685
00:50:56.941 --> 00:50:59.237
No, not usually

686
00:50:59.307 --> 0:51:02.229
I'd ask how old you are,
but most women don't really like that.

687
0:51:02.299 --> 0:51:05.256
- No, we don't.
- It baffles me.

688
0:51:05.361 --> 0:51:07.344
A woman gets older...

689
0:51:07.449 --> 00:51:11.485
she matures, she ripens.

690
00:51:11.554 --> 00:51:14.825
Juices start flowing.
What's to hide?

691
00:51:14.895 --> 00:51:19.036
- Would you like something from the bar?
- Have a drink.

692
00:51:19.106 --> 00:51:21.123
It's a special occasion.

693
00:51:21.192 --> 00:51:25.577
All right. I'd like
a Martini & Rossi on the rocks.

694
00:51:25.681 --> 00:51:28.395
Ah yes.
Sweet or dry?

695
00:51:29.370 --> 00:51:32.014
- What?
- Sweet or dry?

696
00:51:32.083 --> 00:51:34.832
Um, just a little bit of both.

697
00:51:36.224 --> 00:51:40.086
- And foryou, sir?
- White wine spritzer.

698
00:51:44.609 --> 00:51:48.681
- What's the special occasion?
- It's our first lunch together.

699
00:51:50.455 --> 00:51:55.500
This'll give us a chance to break down
some of those corporate barriers.

700
00:51:55.536 --> 00:51:58.841
By the end of lunch, we'll probably
be sharing our intimate histories...

701
00:51:58.910 --> 0:52:01.624
stories of our first time.

702
0:52:01.694 --> 0:52:04.616
Next thing you know we'll be sharing
a cigarette in postcoital bliss.

703
0:52:04.721 --> 0:52:06.286
Are you talking about
us having sex?

704
0:52:06.391 --> 0:52:09.106
Hey, slow down.
You're moving too fast for me.

705
0:52:09.174 --> 00:52:11.227
But if that interests you,
it can be arranged.

706
00:52:11.263 --> 00:52:14.567
And if it doesn't,
I was kidding.

707
00:52:14.603 --> 00:52:18.708
Rosemary chicken's delicious here.
Very tender.

708
00:52:26.329 --> 00:52:28.625
Well, thank you for lunch

709
00:52:28.659 --> 00:52:30.294
Anytime.

710
00:52:38.089 --> 00:52:40.873
Now she's kissing up to Gus?

711
00:52:40.943 --> 00:52:44.214
I can't stand
that conniving little snot.

712
00:52:44.282 --> 00:52:46.022
Here's another one.

713
00:52:46.092 --> 00:52:48.666
In Minneapolis, an 1 1 th grader
beat up a schoolmate...

714
00:52:48.770 --> 00:52:52.354
over a rhinestone leather jacket
and a pair of Fiorucci jeans.

715
00:52:52.425 --> 00:52:55.208
I just don't think that kids
are gonna want to wear uniforms.

716
00:52:55.313 --> 00:52:58.409
Don't you think that they're
kind of plain, kind of boring?

717
00:52:58.479 --> 0:53:02.410
Frankly, it's not up
to the students to decide.

718
0:53:02.481 --> 0:53:07.142
Next week I'll sit the superintendent
of schools down over eggs Florentine...

719
0:53:07.247 --> 00:53:10.309
and I'll convince him
that mandatory school uniforms...

720
00:53:10.414 --> 00:53:13.231
are necessary for the safety
of our schoolchildren.

721
00:53:13.336 --> 00:53:17.337
Not to mention boosting G.A.W. sales.
It'll be absolutely perfect.

722
00:53:17.407 --> 00:53:20.921
I don't know.
Kids like to wear stuff that's them.

723
00:53:20.991 --> 00:53:23.009
My high school
was like a fashion show.

724
00:53:23.078 --> 00:53:27.428
Back then it was safe.
But times, they are a-changin

725
00:53:27.497 --> 00:53:30.420
I guess you're right.
It was a long time ago.

726
00:53:30.524 --> 00:53:33.934
Let's stop. I'm exhausted,
and I'm late to meet Gus.

727
00:53:34.004 --> 00:53:37.171
What's the deal
with you and him?

728
00:53:38.214 --> 00:53:42.007
We've been mutually un-exclusive
for the last seven months.

729
00:53:42.111 --> 00:53:43.364
I brought up
the cohabitation topic recently.

730
00:53:43.364 --> 00:53:44.860
I brought up
the cohabitation topic recently.

731
00:53:44.930 --> 00:53:47.226
And we gave it
some serious thought.

732
00:53:47.331 --> 00:53:50.392
We decided it would be more
practical and convenient...

733
00:53:50.497 --> 00:53:53.906
ifwe maintained separate space.

734
00:53:54.012 --> 00:53:57.108
Which basically means
he isn't ready to commit.

735
00:53:57.213 --> 0:54:00.101
But they're all little boys
pretending to be men, right?

736
0:54:00.170 --> 0:54:02.675
All the guys that I've dated
have been boys.

737
0:54:02.744 --> 0:54:05.424
Precisely.
The Peter Pan syndrome.

738
0:54:05.493 --> 0:54:08.938
God, I really need to get away.

739
0:54:09.773 --> 00:54:13.878
Gus has been trying to talk me into this
wild, dirty weekend in Santa Barbara...

740
00:54:13.983 --> 00:54:16.244
and I really wanna go.

741
00:54:16.315 --> 00:54:18.785
I don't want him to know that...

742
00:54:18.820 --> 00:54:20.907
so I haven't been
too enthusiastic about it.

743
00:54:20.977 --> 00:54:22.786
I know how that goes.

744
00:54:22.856 --> 00:54:27.415
But tonight, I think I'll stop
letting him try and persuade me.

745
00:54:27.484 --> 00:54:29.258
That'll do it.

746
00:54:30.755 --> 00:54:35.138
You go on home, have a glass ofwine,
and put cucumber slices on your eyes.

747
00:54:35.174 --> 00:54:39.210
- You'll feel much better.
- Well, I'm all out of cucumbers.

748
00:54:39.279 --> 00:54:43.872
Sue Ellen, every girl over 25
should have a cucumber in their house.

749
00:54:52.918 --> 00:54:56.538
Remember these things?
They're great. Bounce with me.

750
00:54:56.572 --> 00:54:59.529
I feel stupid.
We are too old to bounce.

751
00:54:59.599 --> 0:55:02.000
Come on.
Bouncing is an ageless pastime.

752
0:55:02.904 --> 0:55:04.227
Come on.

753
0:55:04.331 --> 0:55:06.524
Would you feel more comfortable
if I started?

754
00:55:18.632 --> 00:55:20.058
Come on.

755
0:56:00.664 --> 0:56:02.682
Why'd you stop?

756
0:56:03.935 --> 0:56:05.709
Good moment.

757
00:56:10.024 --> 00:56:12,355
You're gonna have to
get off those things.

758
00:56:17.888 --> 00:56:20.949
There's a band playing
at Club Lago next week. Wanna go?

759
00:56:21.018 --> 00:56:23.559
- You have to be over 21.
- Yeah. Drag.

760
00:56:23.663 --> 00:56:26.342
Tomorrow I'm gonna go to the beach
with some buddies. Wanna come?

761
00:56:26.377 --> 00:56:38.221
I can't.
I've got work.

762
00:56:28.291 --> 00:56:30.344
Oh, yeah. The grind.

763
00:56:31.526 --> 00:56:34.833
- Wanna go to a Dodger game tomorrow?
- That sounds good.

764
00:56:34.937 --> 00:56:37.998
My sister and her boyfriend
got extra tickets. Box seats.

765
00:56:38.103 --> 00:56:41.234
No, wait. I can't.

766
00:56:41.269 --> 00:56:43.844
I just remembered,
I hate baseball.

767
00:56:43.914 --> 00:56:46.349
You hate baseball?

768
00:56:46.419 --> 00:56:49.516
Okay. Then we'll
just do something else.

769
00:56:49.620 --> 00:56:51.951
- Just the two of us.
- Good.

770
00:56:51.986 --> 00:56:54.282
I'll pickyou up at work
around 6:00?

771
00:56:54.352 --> 00:56:57.309
No, don't do that.
I'll call you when I get home.

772
00:56:58.354 --> 0:57:00.963
- What's goin' on?
- Nothing.

773
0:57:01.033 --> 0:57:04.477
- Going out tomorrow night's great.
- Then why not tell me where you work?

774
0:57:04.581 --> 0:57:08.096
Are you doing something illegal?
Are you workin' for the mob?

775
0:57:09 697 --> 00:57:12.828
I just don't want
you to know, okay?

776
00:57:12.932 --> 00:57:15.716
What if I wanted to
send you flowers or somethin'?

777
00:57:15.785 --> 00:57:18.291
Well, you could
send them to the house.

778
00:57:18.395 --> 00:57:20.727
- Who'd sign for them?
- One of the kids.

779
00:57:20.795 --> 00:57:23.893
And what if they're not here?
Why are you makin' this so complicated?

780
00:57:23.962 --> 00:57:25.668
Then don't send me flowers.

781
00:57:25.772 --> 00:57:28.868
I just wanna know what it is
you do all day, that's all.

782
00:57:28.903 --> 00:57:32.592
Come on. Drop it.
Stop acting like Henry VIII.

783
00:57:33.391 --> 00:57:37.185
Just forget it, okay?
I'm sorry I cared.

784
00:57:37.289 --> 00:57:39.446
That's a shitty thing to say!

785
00:57:39.516 --> 00:57:41.951
You're just pissed off because
I don't wanna meet your sister.

786
00:57:42.786 --> 00:57:45.396
Who cares about my sister?

787
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:49.362
All I said was she's been in a slump
'cause of the backstabber at her office.

788
00:57:49.467 --> 00:57:51.554
How do you know
this woman is a backstabber?

789
00:57:51.624 --> 00:57:55.452
Maybe she's nice. Why do you
have to be so judgmental about her?

790
00:57:55.556 --> 00:57:58.861
Look, Swell.
What's up with you, huh?

791
0:58:00.254 --> 0:58:04.603
Are you seein' someone else, or what?
'Cause that's what it sounds like.

792
0:58:04.673 --> 0:58:08.569
I mean, ifyou're seein' some other guy,
you don't have to do all this.

793
0:58:08 639 --> 00:58:10.831
You could just tell me,
just be honest.

794
00:58:10.901 --> 00:58:13.511
No, there is nobody else, okay?

795
00:58:14.902 --> 00:58:17.546
I just wish that
you could respect my privacy.

796
00:58:17.616 --> 00:58:20.296
I'd respect your privacy
ifyou weren't so secretive.

797
00:58:20.364 --> 00:58:23.253
I'd tell you more
ifyou didn't wanna know so much.

798
00:58:24,192 --> 00:58:27.219
Okay. Fine.

799
00:58:29.134 --> 00:58:31.187
I'm outta here.

800
00:59:59.599 --> 01:00:01.965
Doesn't look like Julia's.

801
01:00:02.069 --> 01:00:04.296
Shut up, Quizzoid. Eat.

802
01:00:05.827 --> 01:00:07.289
You're up.

803
01:00:07.358 --> 01:00:09.725
I've been at it all night.
Check these out.

804
01:00:09.829 --> 01:00:14.248
Beautiful Belgian waffles.
Julia made 'em on her show yesterday.

805
01:00:14.317 --> 01:00:17.762
- Did you turn the air-conditioner on?
- Well, I was hot.

806
01:00:17.796 --> 01:00:19.502
I'm stuck with the bills.

807
01:00:19.571 --> 01:00:23.433
I would like to keep
that thermostat at 76, okay?

808
01:00:23.468 --> 01:00:26.600
You take these things
so personally.

809
01:00:34.219 --> 01:00:36.690
- Where are all the dishes?
- In the dishwasher.

810
01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:40.587
- Then empty it.
- Well, that's Zach's job.

811
01:00:42.049 --> 01:00:43.441
I'll do it later.

812
01:00:44.415 --> 01:00:46.258
It was your turn
to dump the trash.

813
01:00:46.328 --> 01:00:48.347
I couldn't fit it
in my schedule.

814
1:01:00.386 --> 1:01:04.074
- Bryan didn't call yet, huh?
- Why not call the stud horse?

815
1:01:04.178 --> 1:01:06.023
I'm letting him cool off.

816
1:01:06.927 --> 01:01:10,162
I'll call him in a few weeks
when all this is over.

817
01:01:10,267 --> 01:01:13.363
Then I can just go to the beach
and take a towel and a Walkman...

818
01:01:13.399 --> 01:01:16.808
and lie in the sand
and rub oil on myself...

819
01:01:16.878 --> 01:01:20.010
and I won't have to interface
with anybody, and get tan.

820
01:01:20.114 --> 01:01:22.341
Little League sign-ups
are at 11:30.

821
01:01:22.445 --> 01:01:25.751
- Don't forget.
- I can't. I've got a sales meeting.

822
01:01:25.785 --> 01:01:27.420
But you promised

823
01:01:28.917 --> 01:01:31.875
- I know. I'm sorry.
- Gonna be late for wor

824
01:01:32.606 --> 01:01:35.981
Yeah, well,
enjoy your childhood.

825
01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:52.543
Traffic is really tied up
on the northbound and southbound 405.

826
01:01:52.647 --> 01:01:54.630
A truck is blocking
the slow lane.

827
01:01: 55.639 --> 01:01: 59.745
You looked so incredible in
that bathing suit. It was unbelievable.

828
01:02:29.425 --> 01:02:31.582
Operation Eggs Florentine
was a rousing success.

829
01:02:31.686 --> 01:02:33.774
The school board
is going to vote on it.

830
01:02:33.809 --> 01:02:36.698
The superintendent needs
cost estimates from us by Wednesday!

831
01:02:36.767 --> 01:02:39.098
This is going to triple
our profit margin.

832
01:02:39.202 --> 01:02:43.447
We'll finally prove
ourselves to New York.

833
01:02:43.517 --> 01:02:47.205
You got roses.
Who might they be from?

834
01:02:47.275 --> 01:02:49.954
They're for you.

835
01:02:52.041 --> 01:02:56.600
Obviously our weekend away in Santa
Barbara was the turning point for us.

836
01:02:56.634 --> 01:02:59.557
Shades of real intimacy.

837
01:02:59.627 --> 1:03:02.897
Have you ever had
a 48-hour orgasm?

838
1:03:02.968 --> 1:03:04.603
I've never been
to Santa Barbara.

839
1:03:04.672 --> 1:03:09.022
Look at me. I'm glowing.
The man makes me glow. Am I glowing?

840
1:03:09.091 --> 01:03:10.657
You're shiny.

841
01:03:10.692 --> 01:03:13.754
Oh, God, I feel like a teenager.

842
01:03:13.823 --> 01:03:16.467
Here are your messages.

843
01:03:16.572 --> 01:03:20.781
Great. Thanks. I'm going
to go glow in my office.

844
01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:30.002
I stole her résumé from Personnel
to check her out.

845
01:03:30.072 --> 01:03:34.805
I had a feeling. None of these companies
ever heard of her. I'm going to Rose.

846
01:03:34.874 --> 01:03:37.031
But the void's getting by.

847
01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:44.581
And Rose loves her.
She's not going to care.

848
01:03:44.686 --> 01:03:46.913
You've got to get something
better on her than that.

849
01:03:48.757 --> 01:03:51.575
What did she do,
copy it from a résumé book?

850
01:03:55.925 --> 01:03:58.499
Crandell house?
We got your home entertainment center.

851
01:03:58.535 --> 1:04:01.979
Yeah. Set it up right over there.

852
1:04:02.083 --> 1:04:05.875
The vote on the unifor.m issue has been
pushed up. I need those estimates today.

853
1:04:05.945 --> 1:04:09.146
I don't see there being
any dilemma with that at all.

854
1:04:09.251 --> 01:04:11.339
We'll messenger them right over.

855
01:04:11.374 --> 01:04:16.558
How are the cost estimates for the
superintendent? He needs them today.

856
01:04:16.627 --> 01:04:19,724
I'm right on top of that, Rose.

857
01:04:31.102 --> 01:04:34.617
- Where's Cathy?
- I don't know. I'm a temp.

858
01:04:34.651 --> 01:04:35.904
Can I help?

859
01:04:38.409 --> 01:04:40.915
- She doesn't want to go with me.
- Just call her.

860
01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:47.943
Oh, hi, Carolyn. I'm sick.
This is a Q.E.D. report.

861
01:04:48.047 --> 01:04:52.049
I promised Sue Ellen I'd do it for her.
Would you see that she gets it?

862
01:04:52.119 --> 01:04:54.519
- It's really important. Thanks.
- Thankyou.

863
01:04:56.258 --> 1:05:00.017
I don't know why,
but she's keeping things from me.

864
1:05:00.086 --> 1:05:01.721
I think it's another guy.

865
1:05:01.792 --> 1:05:05.967
Maybe I should do something crazy,
like sweep her off her feet.

866
1:05:06.071 --> 1:05:09.446
Just forget about her.
She's not worth it.

867
1:05:09.515 --> 01:05:11.254
You deserve better

868
01:05:11.325 --> 01:05:13.203
Problem?

869
01:05:24.999 --> 01:05:28.548
- Don't say anything. I understand.
- What do you understand?

870
01:05:28.618 --> 01:05:30.044
Well...

871
01:05:31.784 --> 01:05:37.943
either the scenario is that you want
to politely thank me for the roses...

872
01:05:37.977 --> 01:05:41.944
or you burst in here
wanting to be impulsive...

873
01:05:42.014 --> 01:05:47.894
and ask me to go to Carmel
with you this weekend.

874
01:05:47.964 --> 01:05:50.469
Sure. We'll fly.
I have my pilot's license.

875
01:05:50.573 --> 01:05:53.601
Maybe I gave you the wrong idea,
but I'm not interested in you.

876
01:05:53.705 --> 01:05:58.890
Then why did you burst through my door
so determined, so eager?

877
01:05:58.959 --> 1:06:01.394
Why are you doing this to Rose?

878
1:06:01.498 --> 1:06:05.118
Hey, look, I'm kidding.
Maybe I gave you the wrong idea.

879
1:06:05.222 --> 1:06:09.014
- Why don't we start with the symphony?
- I'm not starting anything with you.

880
01:06:11.554 --> 01:06:14.478
- Thanks, guys. Bye.
- Anytime.

881
01:06:22.723 --> 01:06:24.220
Awesome.

882
01:06:40.921 --> 01:06:45.931
I say next batch we do more
mocha Swiss Amaretto ones.

883
01:06:46.001 --> 01:06:47.950
Mocha Swiss. Got it.

884
01:06:50.803 --> 01:06:54.143
- I need you!
- Gourmet munchies, man.

885
01:06:54.214 --> 01:06:56.440
Come help!

886
01:06:56.509 --> 01:06:59.154
Something's wrong
with the TV antenna.

887
01:06:59.224 --> 1:07:03.990
I'm in a meeting.
Have Bob Barker help you.

888
01:07:26.885 --> 01:07:31.617
- Go long.
- Thanks. Awesome.

889
01:07:42.821 --> 01:07:46.092
- What is that sound?
- There's something up there.

890
1:08:03.698 --> 1:08:05.715
Help! Somebody help me!

891
01:08:10.587 --> 01:08:12.954
Dude!

892
01:08:18.277 --> 01:08:19.947
Holy shit!

893
01:08:23.983 --> 01:08:26.140
- Your paycheck.
- Thank you.

894
01:08:35.709 --> 01:08:39.084
Where have you been?
Where's the Q.E.D. report?

895
01:08:39.258 --> 01:08:41.207
Rose, I tried--

896
01:08:41.276 --> 01:08:43.469
Yes, the Q.E.D. report.

897
01:08:43.537 --> 01:08:46.600
I have that for you.

898
01:08:46.634 --> 01:08:50.566
What are you doing with it?
What is Carolyn doing with it?

899
01:08:50.636 --> 01:08:55.472
Cathy brought it by. Seems she's been
covering for Sue Ellen, doing her work.

900
01:08:55.542 --> 01:08:57.630
You let Cathy do the Q.E.D. report?

901
1:09:04.310 --> 1:09:07.094
I was wondering
how you would get that...

902
1:09:07.163 --> 01:09:10.086
and the research for
the school presentation done.n

903
01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:13.217
Bravo. You really know
how to delegate responsibility.

904
01:09:13.253 --> 01:09:16.105
You want to be executive material?

905
01:09:16.175 --> 01:09:18.577
Keep an eye on Sue Ellen.

906
01:09:18.681 --> 01:09:21.220
You are a paragon.

907
01:09:26.892 --> 01:09:30.093
- Lunch?
- I'd love to.

908
01:09:30.162 --> 01:09:32.424
- General Apparel West.
- Thanks for the roses.

909
01:09:32.529 --> 01:09:35.591
She's busy right now.
Can I take a message? Is this a joke?

910
01:09:35.695 --> 01:09:37.052
Don't mention it.

911
01:09:37.157 --> 01:09:41.158
River Ridge Hospital is on line three.
There's an emergency with your son?

912
01:09:41.227 --> 01:09:42.862
My son.

913
01:09:42.932 --> 01:09:44.637
- Your son?
- Her son?

914
01:09:45.577 --> 01:09:49.196
Hello? Yes, this is Mrs. Crandel.

915
01:09:50.587 --> 01:09:53.302
What? Oh, my God.

916
01:09:53.335 --> 01:09:56.955
I'll be right there. Will you please
tell him I will be right there?

917
01:09:57.023 --> 01:09:59.042
Thank you.

918
01:09:59.112 --> 1:10:02.452
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. I hope so.

919
1:10:02.556 --> 1:10:06.141
- I didn't know you were married.
- I'm not. I'm divorced.

920
1:10:06.175 --> 1:10:08.541
It's a painful memory.
I don't like to talk about it.

921
01:10:22.042 --> 01:10:24.477
I'm looking for Walter Crandell.

922
01:10:24.581 --> 01:10:28,966
Swell, I don't know ifhe's okay. He's
in with the doctor. He better be okay.

923
01:10:29.036 --> 01:10:31.089
- What happened?
- I'm sorry.

924
01:10:31.158 --> 01:10:34.706
Mrs. Crandell, I'm Dr. Permutter.
Here he is.

925
01:10:34.777 --> 01:10:38.916
Oh, my-- I'm Mrs. Crandell,
Walter's mom.

926
01:10:38.987 --> 01:10:42.466
How is he? What happened?
How do you feel, honey? Are you okay?

927
01:10:42.536 --> 01:10:44.937
It's a clean break.
It should heal nicely.

928
01:10:45.006 --> 01:10:47.267
I fell off the roof.

929
01:10:47.337 --> 01:10:50.016
What was he doing on the roof?

930
01:10:50.087 --> 01:10:53.357
I wasn't there. I should have been.
I mean, not on the roof.

931
01:10:53.427 --> 01:10:56.524
But I should have been with him,
taking care of him.

932
01:10:56.592 --> 01:10:59.445
Reading Gr.een EggsAnd Ham
or some shit like that.

933
01:10:59.516 --> 1:11:02.578
Walt, man,
I'm really sorry.

934
1:11:02.646 --> 1:11:05.743
You'll have to bring him back
for a walking cast in six weeks.

935
1:11:05.813 --> 1:11:08.840
Have him take one of those
if he has any pain.

936
1:11:08.876 --> 01:11:12.564
We'll stop and get you
an ice-cream cone, okay?

937
01:11:12,633 --> 01:11:14.755
That doesn't make up
foryour irresponsibility.

938
01:11:14.825 --> 01:11:18.409
Look! I screwed up!
I'm sorry.

939
01:11:18.513 --> 01:11:21.053
Is he your son too?

940
01:11:22.201 --> 01:11:25.228
No. He's my stepson.

941
01:11:26.586 --> 01:11:28.673
That's why we don't
get along so well.

942
01:11:28.778 --> 01:11:33.092
We better get along home for supper.
I'm making pot roast, Walter's favorite.

943
01:11:33.197 --> 01:11:36.015
Come on, kids. Let's go.
Chop, chop.

944
01:11:36.119 --> 01:11:38.242
- Take it easy.
- Help your brother.

945
01:11:38.311 --> 01:11:40.364
I can't believe you
let this happen to him.

946
01:11:40,434 --> 01:11:42.557
- Go to hell.
- Damn it

947
01:11:51.047 --> 01:11:53.134
- Shit.
- What?

948
01:11:53.204 --> 01:11:56.057
My check is only for $735.

949
01:11:56.126 --> 01:11:58.458
I thought you were getting,
like, over a grand.

950
01:11:58.563 --> 1:12:01.833
Taxes. They took half
of my money away for taxes...

951
1:12:01.937 --> 1:12:04.443
and some savings
and pension plan.

952
1:12:06.566 --> 1:12:09.349
At least I have enough to cover
what we spent from petty cash.

953
1:12:09.418 --> 01:12:11.436
- How are you doing?
- Hollywood Squar.es are on.

954
01:12:11.506 --> 01:12:13.384
Bitchin'!

955
01:12:22.293 --> 01:12:25.633
- Where'd this come from?
- Japan. It's state of the art.

956
01:12:25.667 --> 01:12:31.025
It's nice, but where did you get the
money for something so state of the art?

957
01:12:31.130 --> 01:12:34.715
It was petty cash money.
You were spending petty cash money.

958
01:12:34.783 --> 01:12:39.898
I bought a pair of boots and a magazine!
You bought a home entertainment center?

959
01:12:39.968 --> 01:12:43.413
- It was Walter's idea.
- It's going back.

960
01:12:43.482 --> 01:12:45.639
We can't take it back.
We got it on sale.

961
01:12:45.709 --> 01:12:48.492
It wasn't your money.
It was my money.

962
01:12:48.563 --> 01:12:52.702
It wasn't really your money either.
You embezzled it.

963
01:12:52.772 --> 01:12:56.008
I did not embezzle it.
I borrowed it.

964
01:12:56.112 --> 1:13:00.949
I was going to put it back after my next
paycheck, but we can't afford all this.

965
1:13:01.019 --> 1:13:04.567
How could you do this?
You would never steal from Mom.

966
1:13:05.925 --> 1:13:08.082
That's because Mom
never had that much.

967
01:13:11.666 --> 01:13:13.823
There's only $30 left.

968
01:13:13.928 --> 01:13:16.398
You should see the Zsa Zsa diamond ring
he bought for Cynthia.

969
01:13:17.894 --> 01:13:19.912
You bought her a diamond?

970
01:13:20.016 --> 01:13:22.313
- How much was it?
- It was a chip.

971
01:13:22.382 --> 01:13:24.401
- Get it back.
- Diamonds are forever.

972
01:13:24.435 --> 01:13:28.646
I needed a new bike, and I got Walter
the new edition of Super.Password...

973
01:13:28.715 --> 01:13:30.455
and Elvis a new chew toy.

974
01:13:30.489 --> 01:13:32.890
You have spent over $3,000?

975
01:13:35.987 --> 01:13:38.040
You are all grounded.

976
01:13:38.944 --> 01:13:42.355
- How could you steal from me?
- They didn't really steal.

977
01:13:42.459 --> 01:13:45.903
They borrowed. They were following
your irresponsible example.

978
01:13:46.008 --> 01:13:50.114
Shut up. I am in deep shit.

979
01:13:50.218 --> 01:13:52.445
Quit your job.
Get out while you can.

980
01:13:52.515 --> 01:13:55.472
I'm an embezzler.
They're going to throw me in prison.

981
01:13:55.542 --> 01:13:58.813
The judge will probably go easy on you,
considering you're a minor.

982
01:13:58.882 --> 1:14:03.128
I'm not going to give up.
I'll just economize.

983
1:14:03.232 --> 1:14:06.676
I'll keep working.
I'll work overtime.

984
1:14:06.781 --> 01:14:10.120
A few more paychecks, I'll be able to
put it back and no one will know, right?

985
01:14:10.190 --> 01:14:11.512
I'm innocent.

986
01:14:14.052 --> 01:14:15.723
G.A.W.'s history.

987
01:14:15.827 --> 01:14:17.916
- We're going to be out of a job.
- What?

988
01:14:17.949 --> 01:14:22.091
The school board rejected it.
You were right.

989
01:14:22.159 --> 01:14:26.056
The students got wind of it
and held a huge protest.

990
01:14:26.092 --> 01:14:29.954
They burned uniforms in effigy.
This was our last hope.

991
01:14:30.058 --> 01:14:33.120
We're probably all
going to be canned tomorrow.

992
01:14:35.104 --> 01:14:37.714
Listen, can't you call New York?

993
01:14:37.818 --> 01:14:40.810
Convince them to give us more time
so we can keep working?

994
01:14:40.879 --> 01:14:44.150
Why bother?
It's not the end of the world.

995
01:14:44.219 --> 01:14:47.282
- It's just a job.
- But I need this job.

996
01:14:50.204 --> 01:14:53.161
I have to tell you.
I kind of have a problem.

997
01:14:53.232 --> 01:14:58.103
You're not going to have a problem.
You're going to be fine, believe me.

998
01:14:58.207 --> 1:15:00.504
With all your qualifications
and background...

999
1:15:00.573 --> 1:15:03.148
you're going to land
an even better job.

1000
1:15:03.253 --> 1:15:05.583
Do me a favor, would you?

1001
1:15:05.654 --> 1:15:07.811
Would you break
the news to Franklin?

1002
1:15:07.880 --> 01:15:10.664
You're so good
at dealing with the staff.

1003
01:15:13.551 --> 01:15:19.049
With your qualifications and background,
you'll land an even better job.

1004
01:15:21.659 --> 01:15:23.816
Thanks.

1005
01:15:25.034 --> 01:15:28.618
You've been a real trouper
right to the end.

1006
01:15:30.218 --> 01:15:32.306
I'm going to miss you.

1007
01:16:42.592 --> 01:16:44.992
Rose, I have an idea.

1008
01:16:47.185 --> 01:16:50.350
This is going to save our
collective asses. It's fabulous.

1009
01:16:50.455 --> 01:16:54.838
I don't want New York to know anything
about it. They'd never approve funding.

1010
01:16:54.909 --> 1:17:00.128
You'll need to rent a banquet hall.
You do have enough in petty cash, right?

1011
1:17:00.198 --> 1:17:01.694
Well--

1012
1:17:03.920 --> 1:17:07.574
- I have to tell you something.
- Go ahead, you honey

1013
01:17:11.402 --> 01:17:15.507
Banquet halls are so impersonal

1014
01:17:15.611 --> 01:17:19.091
My house is fabulous.
We can have it there. It'll be perfect.

1015
01:17:19.195 --> 01:17:21.735
We are a family of felons.

1016
01:17:21.805 --> 01:17:25.737
Our summer of freedom is going to be a
winter prison if I don't get some help.

1017
01:17:25.807 --> 01:17:29.182
I want this place spick-and-span
by Saturday, or I'm turning us all in.

1018
01:17:29.286 --> 01:17:30.852
Are you with me?

1019
01:17:32.834 --> 01:17:34.818
Guys, what do you say?

1020
01:17:34.923 --> 01:17:36.175
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1021
01:17:36.244 --> 01:17:38.263
- Come on! What do you say?
- All right!

1022
01:17:38.333 --> 01:17:40.942
We're with you!
Rock and roll!

1023
01:17:52.598 --> 01:17:53.920
Thank you.

1024
1:18:01.158 --> 1:18:04.846
- Take a look.
- I don't know. This is risky

1025
1:18:04.951 --> 1:18:06.620
Let me show you one more thing.

1026
1:18:06.690 --> 01:18:12.152
Here is a normal waiter's uniform, but
I was thinking of changing the color.

1027
01:18:12.257 --> 01:18:15.598
Or it could be in black and white,
turquoise and black or red and black.

1028
01:18:49.279 --> 01:18:52.445
- Coffee, dear?
- Yeah.

1029
01:18:59.266 --> 1:19:03.510
Thankyou, everyone, for staying.
We're going to pull an all-nighter.

1030
1:19:08.799 --> 01:19:11,200
Strike two!

1031
01:19:11.269 --> 01:19:13.322
It's okay. You can do it.

1032
01:19:13.357 --> 01:19:16.348
I know you can. Concentrate.

1033
01:19:20.699 --> 01:19:23.587
Home run! Way to go!

1034
01:19:23.621 --> 01:19:25.640
That's my girl.

1035
01:19:39.870 --> 01:19:42.723
But the recipe calls for shrimp,
so I need some more cash.

1036
01:19:42.794 --> 01:19:46.273
I told you.
We have to economize.

1037
01:19:46.342 --> 01:19:48.673
There's nothing left in petty cash.
I've taken it all.

1038
01:19:51.318 --> 01:19:53.301
Just try to do the best you can.

1039
01:19:58.311 --> 1:20:01.617
Wait. I have a coupon for that.
It's a double coupon.

1040
01:20:37.351 --> 01:20:39.266
Where are the kids?

1041
01:20:39.370 --> 01:20:43.962
Zach's at Cynthia's,
Melissa's upstairs, and Walter's asleep.

1042
01:20:46.119 --> 01:20:49.877
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing is wrong with me.

1043
01:20:54.888 --> 01:20:56.453
Did you burn something?

1044
01:20:56.558 --> 1:21:00.629
Maybe ifyou'd called and told me
you were going to be four hours late...

1045
1:21:00.734 --> 1:21:03.169
I could have planned
my dinner better.

1046
1:21:03.273 --> 1:21:07.101
- I had to work late, okay?
- You still should have called.

1047
1:21:07.171 --> 1:21:09.188
I sat, and I waited.

1048
1:21:09.258 --> 01:21:13.120
I went ahead and fed the kids.
I worked all day on that casserole.

1049
01:21:13.189 --> 01:21:14.303
Sorry.

1050
01:21:14.407 --> 01:21:16,600
You haven't even said
how nice the house looks.

1051
01:21:16.704 --> 01:21:19.349
You're off at the office all day
doing interesting office things.

1052
01:21:19.418 --> 01:21:23.245
I'm stuck here,
cooking and cleaning and mowing.

1053
01:21:23.315 --> 01:21:26.586
Helping Melissa with her fastball.
Being a role model forZach.

1054
01:21:26.655 --> 01:21:30.622
Spending quality time with Walter.
Doing your party shit!

1055
01:21:30.691 --> 01:21:33.684
You've got the car, and you don't
even take me anywhere anymore.

1056
01:21:33.754 --> 01:21:37.302
When was the last time we went out
to dinner together, huh?

1057
01:21:37.372 --> 01:21:40.399
I'm sick and tired
of not being appreciated.

1058
01:21:40,434 --> 01:21:42.313
I appreciate you.

1059
01:21:42.383 --> 01:21:44.645
Eat shit!

1060
01:21:45.757 --> 01:21:48.019
I don't believe this.

1061
01:21:48.089 --> 01:21:52.438
I have to get up at 5:30 every morning,
so I can beat rush-hour traffic...

1062
01:21:52.508 --> 01:21:58.179
and go sit behind a desk for eight hours
and miss Oprah every day of my vacation.

1063
01:21:58.249 --> 1:22:02.911
Then I get to drive home in gridlock
in a Volvo with no air-conditioning...

1064
1:22:02.981 --> 1:22:06.113
just so I can take care ofyou guys
and put food on the damn table.

1065
1:22:06.217 --> 1:22:08.618
It's a rat race,
and it sucks.

1066
1:22:08.722 --> 01:22:11.018
So what do you want, a medal?

1067
01:22:16.795 --> 01:22:19.370
You don't have to do all this.

1068
01:22:19.439 --> 01:22:21.526
I never asked you
to whisk the couch.

1069
01:22:21.596 --> 01:22:24.589
Well, it needed it.

1070
01:22:32.556 --> 01:22:36.314
I knew she was a phony.
I did not think she was a thief.

1071
01:22:45.048 --> 01:22:48.179

1073
01:22:53.781 --> 01:22:56.983
She didn't steal from petty cash.
She paid for the buyers' shindig.

1074
01:22:57.052 --> 01:22:59.940
It's all legit.

1075
1:23:00.010 --> 1:23:02.898
Let's get out of here.
I give up.

1076
01:23:19.947 --> 01:23:22.522
She's only 17

1077
01:23:28.471 --> 01:23:30.663
Don't be rude to anybody.

1078
01:23:30.767 --> 01:23:32.751
Don't spit on anybody.

1079
01:23:32.856 --> 01:23:35.395
Don't wander off because
I want you to meet my boss.

1080
01:23:35.430 --> 01:23:38.249
- Remember. Call me Mommy.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1081
01:23:38.319 --> 01:23:41.694
- Let's rehearse. Melissa, come, honey!
- Okay, Mommy!

1082
01:23:43.469 --> 01:23:45.591
- Hi, Mrs. Crandell.
- Hi, kids.

1083
01:23:45.695 --> 01:23:47.748
Thanks for helping out.

1084
01:23:47.782 --> 01:23:49.905
- Where's Kenny?
- Getting ready.

1085
01:23:53.419 --> 01:23:56.690
- Good evening, Mrs. Crandell.
- You look great.

1086
01:23:56.795 --> 1:24:00.170
That's Kenneth.
The guests have started to arrive.

1087
1:24:00.239 --> 1:24:02.049
Man your trays.

1088
1:24:02.222 --> 1:24:04.206
Get going there.

1089
1:24:04.275 --> 1:24:07.720
Good tray. Good tray. All right.

1090
1:24:07.790 --> 1:24:09.808
Go get them, big man.

1091
01:24:12.869 --> 01:24:15.026
Better get your ass out there,
Mrs. Crandell.

1092
01:24:25.700 --> 01:24:27.021
Hi, Mommy.

1093
01:24:27.091 --> 01:24:29.457
This is my daughter, Melissa.

1094
01:24:29.492 --> 01:24:31.894
Hey, boss lady, creole mushroom?

1095
01:24:31.998 --> 01:24:34.572
Hello, Melissa.
No, thanks. Not tonight.

1096
01:24:34.642 --> 01:24:37.425
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

1097
01:24:37.495 --> 01:24:40.278
I love that they're wearing
our uniforms. Fabulous touch.

1098
01:24:43.202 --> 01:24:47.725
- Look at the jalopy.
- This is going to be so much fun.

1099
01:24:47.794 --> 01:24:52.283
- Yeah.
- Yo, mad dog. Want to park the car?

1100
01:24:52.351 --> 01:24:56.353
- We're on a break, dude.
- Park it yourself, Metallica breath.

1101
01:24:58,928 --> 01:25:01.608
I brought this Jell-O mold
just in case you needed one.

1102
1:25:01.677 --> 1:25:06.305
This is my husband, Howard.
I love your house. Oh, wow.

1103
1:25:08.497 --> 01:25:12.464
Take the baked Brie out of the oven.
It will caramelize.

1104
01:25:16.048 --> 01:25:20.676
- Where you been? You're our maitre d'.
- Cynthia dumped me for Jacob.

1105
01:25:20.744 --> 01:25:24.572
- Honey, I'm so sorry.
- I just don't understand.

1106
01:25:24.677 --> 01:25:27.703
- She was my moon goddess.
- I know.

1107
01:25:28.503 --> 01:25:30.556
- Get over it.
- Get the diamond back?

1108
01:25:30.626 --> 01:25:33.375
I'm out of rumaki.

1109
01:25:34.106 --> 01:25:37.341
Let me get that for you.
I'm maitred'.

1110
01:25:41.482 --> 01:25:43.152
Excuse me.

1111
01:25:44.579 --> 01:25:47.084
What is it? Something?

1112
01:25:47.154 --> 01:25:49.624
Since this is the biggest night
in G.A.W. history..

1113
01:25:49.694 --> 01:25:54.357
I thought you might like to know this
all rests in the hands of a child...

1114
01:25:54.462 --> 01:25:56.165
a child you hired.

1115
01:25:58.218 --> 1:26:01.524
This is by far and away
the most petty...

1116
1:26:02.429 --> 1:26:06.639
spiteful, vindictive machination
you have ever concocted.

1117
1:26:09.005 --> 01:26:11.684
Grow up, Carolyn.

1118
01:26:11.754 --> 01:26:14.085
We're here.
What do you want us to do?

1119
01:26:14.190 --> 01:26:17.425
Great. Why don't you go up
to my room and change?

1120
01:26:17.529 --> 01:26:20.105
I'll be up there
in a few seconds, okay?

1121
01:26:20.174 --> 01:26:22.192
This is going to be great.

1122
01:26:35.588 --> 01:26:39.346
I was looking for you.
Great house.

1123
01:26:39.416 --> 01:26:41.503
- You look lovely.
- Thank you.

1124
01:26:41.573 --> 01:26:44.530
-I know you said you're not interested--
-That's right. I'm not.

1125
01:26:44.599 --> 01:26:48.287
I understand why. I want you to know
I'm not taking this lightly.

1126
01:26:48.393 --> 01:26:50.724
I don't think it's fair--

1127
01:26:50.793 --> 01:26:53.403
I know. My timing is off.

1128
01:26:53.473 --> 01:26:56.361
I know you're just
getting over a divorce.

1129
01:26:56.430 --> 1:27:00.988
You can't imagine how off
your timing is. Forget it.

1130
1:27:02.067 --> 1:27:04.641
Or we could just have a wild,
sweaty fling. What do you think?

1131
1:27:05.790 --> 1:27:07.285
you know...

1132
1:27:08.713 --> 01:27:12,122
I think the scenario here
is that you're a sleazeball.

1133
01:27:12.192 --> 01:27:15.045
Hey. I was kidding.

1134
01:27:15.115 --> 01:27:16.785
I surrender.

1135
01:27:22.248 --> 01:27:24.927
What's this? What is this?

1136
01:27:26.772 --> 01:27:28.545
Just a little accident.

1137
01:27:31.886 --> 01:27:34.566
Gus has sort of
a little crush on me.

1138
01:27:34.635 --> 01:27:36.757
He's been coming on to you?

1139
01:27:36.861 --> 01:27:39.089
Come on.

1140
01:27:39.193 --> 01:27:41.663
You know how I feel about you.

1141
01:27:41.698 --> 01:27:44.586
You're the one I want to
listen to beautiful music with.

1142
01:27:44.621 --> 01:27:46.013
You

1143
01:27:47.125 --> 01:27:49.144
He sent those roses to me.

1144
01:27:49.249 --> 01:27:52.415
This is not true!

1145
01:27:52.484 --> 01:27:54.815
Believe me.

1146
01:27:54.885 --> 01:27:58.852
We're all adults here, and we have
a presentation to get through.

1147
01:27:58.921 --> 1:28:01.427
The buyer from Saks
is looking for you.

1148
1:28:02.715 --> 1:28:05.359
It's show time.

1149
1:28:09.360 --> 01:28:10.438
Good evening.

1150
01:28:13.152 --> 01:28:15.484
Thank you.
I'm Rose Lindsey.

1151
01:28:15.554 --> 01:28:19.416
On behalf of General Apparel West,
I'd like to welcome you.

1152
01:28:19.450 --> 01:28:23.417
I'm sure you're all on the edge ofyour
seats wondering what we have in store.

1153
01:28:23.487 --> 01:28:28.671
So to conduct our presentation,
I'd like to introduce our hostess...

1154
01:28:28.741 --> 01:28:31.524
our recently named
employee of the month...

1155
01:28:31.594 --> 01:28:34.238
and the woman responsible
for all you're going to view tonight.

1156
01:28:39.491 --> 01:28:40.466
Thank you.

1157
01:28:41.892 --> 01:28:43.493
Welcome, everyone.

1158
01:28:43.597 --> 01:28:47.321
For 12 years General Apparel West
has enjoyed a solid reputation...

1159
01:28:47.391 --> 01:28:51.531
as the manufacturer of quality uniforms,
but times, they are a-changin'.

1160
01:28:51.566 --> 01:28:53.653
We're growing.
We're expanding.

1161
01:28:53.723 --> 01:28:56.680
We're approaching the millennium
with a fresh attitude and look.

1162
01:28:56.785 --> 1:29:00.682
What we have foryou is a preview
of the General Apparel West to come.

1163
1:29:04.614 --> 1:29:07.189
Ladies and gentlemen,
General Apparel West proudly presents...

1164
1:29:07.293 --> 01:29:10.251
the teenage fashion wave
of the future.

1165
01:29:19.089 --> 01:29:21.976
Tess, Marcie and Donna
are wearing bellhop uniforms...

1166
01:29:22.046 --> 01:29:26.291
in fuchsia, purple and teal,
hand airbrushed silk with matching caps.

1167
01:29:26.361 --> 01:29:30.258
The epaulets and cuff detailing
are antique gold lace.

1168
01:29:30.362 --> 01:29:34.258
The jackets, in varying lengths,
are matched with sporty black pants...

1169
01:29:34.328 --> 01:29:36.451
or sleek miniskirts.

1170
01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:40.348
The basic General Apparel West uniform
has been modified and accessorized...

1171
01:29:40.418 --> 01:29:45.081
to create a fun and sexy look
for the teenage girl.

1172
01:29:47.342 --> 01:29:50.959
Nicole is wearing a form-fitting
nurse's uniform with mini-hemline.

1173
01:29:51.030 --> 01:29:52.944
It'll speed up any boy's pulse.

1174
01:29:55.136 --> 01:29:57.676
The black diamonds
on Nicole's cap and dress...

1175
01:29:57.745 --> 1:30:00.041
are hand airbrushed
on fuchsia spandex.

1176
1:30:00.911 --> 1:30:04.913
Her pink high-top sneakers
are laced up her tangerine tights.

1177
1:30:05.017 --> 1:30:09.715
Of course, no nurse would be complete
without her stethoscope necklace.

1178
01:30:18,100 --> 01:30:21.197
Jill, our referee, is wearing
an oversized silk jersey...

1179
01:30:21.266 --> 01:30:25.372
in bold black-and-turquoise stripes,
black tights and high-top sneakers.

1180
01:30:26.311 --> 01:30:29.722
Her whistle earrings and necklace
and black baseball cap...

1181
01:30:29.791 --> 01:30:31.810
complement this carefree
and spirited look with the girl...

1182
01:30:31.880 --> 01:30:34.488
who's playing the field
and calling all the plays.

1183
01:30:36.854 --> 01:30:38.942
Swell, it's me. It's Bryan.

1184
01:30:38.977 --> 01:30:42.039
We got to talk about this.
Forget about this other guy.

1185
01:30:42.109 --> 01:30:45.554
We can work this out.
It was really stupid what happened.

1186
01:30:45.658 --> 01:30:48.719
I don't know ifit was some kind
of communication meltdown or what.

1187
01:30:49.693 --> 01:30:52.721
- Katrina, our chef, is...
- We should work it out.

1188
01:30:52.825 --> 01:30:54.843
really cooking in her scarf.

1189
01:30:54.947 --> 01:30:57.871
She's whipping up excitement
in her boots. Thank you.

1190
01:30:57.940 --> 01:30:58.915
Thank you.

1191
1:31:00.237 --> 1:31:04.585
I really care about us.
There's something about you.

1192
1:31:04.656 --> 1:31:08.796
I don't even know what it is, but I feel
better around you than anyone else.

1193
1:31:08.867 --> 01:31:11.545
- That's why I really miss you.
- Our last model is Becky.

1194
01:31:12.972 --> 01:31:16.347
Becky is our Boy Scout.
She's wearing a Boy Scout's uniform.

1195
01:31:16,416 --> 01:31:18.434
Thank you.

1196
01:31:18.504 --> 01:31:20.278
Thank you.

1197
01:31:30.021 --> 01:31:34.823
And, everyone, the highlight
of our fashion extravaganza.

1198
01:31:34.892 --> 01:31:38.162
Young Bryan, our Clown Dog server.

1199
01:31:44.739 --> 01:31:45.991
You're having a party?

1200
01:31:47.244 --> 01:31:51.906
Bryan is wearing
a Clown Dog uniform...

1201
01:31:52.011 --> 01:31:57.578
with a classic wedge cap,
evoking the charming nostalgia--

1202
01:31:57.649 --> 01:31:59.666
- What?
- Mom's home.

1203
1:32:01.545 --> 1:32:03.319
Hi, Mom.

1204
1:32:05.894 --> 1:32:08.122
- Busted.
- Dude

1205
1:32:09.757 --> 01:32:13.062
And that is our presentation
for this evening. Thankyou for coming.

1206
01:32:13.166 --> 01:32:15.393
good night

1207
01:32:15.498 --> 01:32:18.107
- What are you doing?
- I'm right on top of that.

1208
01:32:18.211 --> 01:32:19.708
Finish the presentation.

1209
01:32:19.777 --> 01:32:23.048
- It's not as bad as you think.
- Save it.

1210
01:32:23.118 --> 01:32:24.440
Shit.

1211
01:32:24.510 --> 01:32:27.153
Go on.Just do it.

1212
01:32:27.257 --> 01:32:30.808
Swell! You're in big trouble,
young lady.

1213
01:32:35.470 --> 01:32:37.766
I can't handle this anymore.

1214
01:32:37.836 --> 01:32:40.758
I applied for a receptionist job.

1215
01:32:40.863 --> 01:32:44.586
I don't even know what an executive
administrator assistant does.

1216
01:32:44.690 --> 01:32:49.388
I lied to everyone
about everything...

1217
01:32:49.457 --> 01:32:51.928
and I'm sorry.

1218
01:32:56.173 --> 1:33:00.279
I'm only 17. I have a curfew.
I just finished high school.

1219
1:33:00.383 --> 1:33:02.609
I can't even vote yet.

1220
1:33:02.714 --> 1:33:05.324
This was supposed
to be my summer vacation.

1221
1:33:05.428 --> 1:33:07.447
I'm not supposed
to be a career mom.

1222
1:33:07.515 --> 01:33:12.247
I can't be the hub
of your communication network.

1223
01:33:13.848 --> 01:33:17.189
I'm really not ready
for any of this.

1224
01:33:17.257 --> 01:33:18.755
I'm sorry.

1225
01:33:19.973 --> 01:33:21.364
I'm so sorry

1226
01:33:23.034 --> 01:33:24.983
I'm sorry.

1227
01:33:26.688 --> 01:33:29.054
How humiliating. I love it.

1228
01:33:29.158 --> 01:33:31.768
Yeah, babe.Justice is served.

1229
01:33:39.422 --> 01:33:42.172
what are you doing here?

1230
01:33:42.241 --> 01:33:46.311
So do you believe me now? Or are
you just going to believe some kid?

1231
01:33:46.347 --> 01:33:48.748
I'm going to believe some kid.

1232
01:33:48.853 --> 01:33:51.357
Go to hell

1233
01:33:53.271 --> 01:33:56.611
I'm not real clear about
what's been going on around here...

1234
01:33:56.680 --> 01:33:59.117
But I want these people 
out of my property.

1235
01:33:59.186 --> 1:34:02.526
I want you to start doing
some heavy-duty explaining.

1236
1:34:02.595 --> 1:34:06.702
I am never trusting you again.
I specifically said no parties.

1237
1:34:06.770 --> 1:34:08.162
You weren't supposed
to come home yet.

1238
1:34:08.232 --> 01:34:11.572
Sorry to have messed up your plans.
Who are these people?

1239
01:34:11.643 --> 01:34:15.227
- Mom, calm down.
- I will not calm down.

1240
01:34:15.331 --> 01:34:17.209
What happened to Walter?

1241
01:34:17.279 --> 01:34:20.933
He had a little accident,
but everything is taken care of.

1242
01:34:21.002 --> 01:34:23.054
We have excellent
medical coverage.

1243
01:34:23.090 --> 01:34:25.247
We will clean up the party.

1244
01:34:25.352 --> 01:34:29.075
You've had a long flight,
and you're cranky.

1245
01:34:29.179 --> 01:34:31.231
I have had a very rough night.

1246
01:34:31.267 --> 01:34:33.320
Why don't you go upstairs
and take a nap?

1247
01:34:33.354 --> 01:34:36.591
Tomorrow morning Kenny will whip up
a batch of Belgium waffles...

1248
01:34:36.695 --> 01:34:39.965
and we'll sit down
and discuss this like adults.

1249
01:34:40.069 --> 01:34:41.810
Fine.

1250
01:34:41.914 --> 01:34:44.523
Why don't you guys
go wrap up the party?

1251
01:34:44.593 --> 01:34:48.212
- Why don't you help Walter to bed?
- Good night, Mom-- I mean, Swell.

1252
01:34:52.109 --> 01:34:53.674
Thank you.

1253
01:34:54.787 --> 01:34:58.998
- What did you do to yourself?
- We'll talk about it in the morning.

1254
01:34:59.068 --> 1:35:02.339
But for now, why don't you
just go to your room?

1255
01:35:15.490 --> 01:35:19.839
- I can not believe it.
- Oh, that's very funny

1256
01:35:19.944 --> 01:35:21.614
What?

1257
01:35:33.480 --> 01:35:35.149
I'll be damned.

1258
01:35:48.024 --> 01:35:50.041
I'm so sorry

1259
01:35:52.095 --> 01:35:56.966
The buyers didn't care anything
about that scene.

1260
01:35:57.035 --> 1:36:00,132
They're all just
a bunch of old whores.

1261
1:36:00.202 --> 1:36:01.906
They loved your ideas.

1262
1:36:01.976 --> 1:36:04.411
I see nothing but dollar signs

1263
1:36:04.482 --> 1:36:06.500
As a matter of fact,
they complimented me...

1264
1:36:06.568 --> 01:36:10.049
on hiring a teenager
to gain market perspective.

1265
01:36:10.083 --> 01:36:13.771
I've got seven meetings
set up next week alone.

1266
01:36:13.876 --> 01:36:16.277
They want the new G.A.W. Iine.

1267
01:36:17.530 --> 01:36:20.835
But what about everything else?

1268
01:36:20.905 --> 01:36:25,393
I lied to you.
I'm a terrible person.

1269
01:36:25.462 --> 01:36:29.150
Well, I suppose
you'll grow out of that.

1270
01:36:30.265 --> 01:36:31.691
Maybe

1271
01:36:35.588 --> 01:36:41.642
Dude, that was a superior party.
Superior eats.

1272
01:36:41.747 --> 01:36:45.922
- Yeah. Thanks for helping out.
- No problem.

1273
01:36:45.991 --> 01:36:48.357
What do you say,
beer bust tomorrow night?

1274
01:36:48.461 --> 01:36:51.942
I can't. I got a date
with Swell's friend Nicole.

1275
01:36:52.012 --> 01:36:54.029
- the nurse?
- Yeah

1276
01:36:55.177 --> 01:36:56.361
Hot.

1277
01:36:57.613 --> 1:37:01.510
School starts next week.
Lazy days.

1278
1:37:01.580 --> 1:37:05.755
I don't know. I was thinking
I might go to class more.

1279
1:37:05.859 --> 1:37:07.112
Why?

1280
1:37:08.608 --> 01:37:11,392
Well, it's time to finish up school..

1281
01:37:12.471 --> 01:37:14.488
I might take some Home Ec.

1282
01:37:14.558 --> 01:37:15.846
graduate.

1283
01:37:15.950 --> 01:37:19.707
Maybe go to the Culinary Academy
Or some shit like this

1284
01:37:19.777 --> 01:37:24.440
- That could be cool.
- Yeah. It's time to do something.

1285
01:37:24.544 --> 01:37:28.164
Please reconsider. I'm offering you
a wonderful opportunity.

1286
01:37:28.232 --> 01:37:32.233
I know.
I appreciate it a lot. Really.

1287
01:37:32.303 --> 01:37:36.339
But I think
I'm going to try college.

1288
01:37:36.409 --> 01:37:40.306
Design school or something. I don't
know. I still have a lot to learn.

1289
01:37:40.376 --> 01:37:43.056
If you want to get into Vassar,
I could pull some strings.

1290
01:37:43.124 --> 01:37:44.621
Maybe

1291
01:37:47.543 --> 01:37:49.561
I'm going to miss you.

1292
01:37:49.632 --> 01:37:52.345
I'm going to miss you too.

1293
1:38:00.732 --> 1:38:02.714
Thank you.

1294
01:38:10.298 --> 01:38:12.387
Let's get together on Monday night.
We will have dinner.

1295
01:38:14.266 --> 01:38:16.702
Bye, sweetie.

1296
01:38:50.348 --> 01:38:52.853
I am really sorry.

1297
01:38:52.922 --> 01:38:55.255
Yeah.

1298
01:38:55.324 --> 01:38:59.847
Carolyn and I both pretty much
figured out what's been going on.

1299
01:38:59.917 --> 1:39:01.726
Is that everything?

1300
1:39:01.796 --> 1:39:04.544
There isn't anything else
you haven't told me, right?

1301
1:39:05.380 --> 1:39:08.302
You're not really a guy, are you?

1302
01:39:14.113 --> 01:39:18.914
So, did you mean what you said
about working things out?

1303
01:39:18.984 --> 01:39:21.524
We broke up. Remember?

1304
01:39:21.629 --> 01:39:23.820
We didn't break up.
We had a fight.

1305
01:39:23.924 --> 01:39:27.335
- Yeah, because you were lying to me.
- Yeah, but that's over.

1306
01:39:27.405 --> 01:39:32.241
So ifyou thought we broke up, I guess
you thought we were together, huh?

1307
01:39:32.345 --> 01:39:34.259
Well, yeah.

1308
01:39:34.328 --> 01:39:39.234
Anyway, I guess now
that I know the truth--

1309
01:39:45.184 --> 01:39:47.621
Well, thanks for sticking around.

1310
01:39:51.865 --> 01:39:54.683
What are you doing 
New Year's Eve?

1311
1:40:08 601 --> 01:40:11.385
I think this is another
really good moment.

1312
01:40:11.454 --> 01:40:13.960
Me too.

1313
01:40:22,554 --> 01:40:24.711
How do you Tzny Tsttiay escape
From all this anyway

1314
01:40:24.815 --> 01:40:26.660
I pretty much did.

1315
01:40:26.730 --> 01:40:30.348
- Beautiful, something else also.
- Yes, Mom?

1316
01:40:30.452 --> 01:40:32.471
Where is the babysitter?

1317
01:40:51.712 --> 01:40:54.182
I'm really going to miss her.

1318
01:40:54.252 --> 01:40:56.688
You never even knew her.

1319
01:40:56.757 --> 01:40:59.680
Yeah, but she left us
all her money.

1320
01:40:59.749 --> 1:41:02.115
She's already dead, you moron!

1321
1:41:03.229 --> 1:41:05.003
Well, that's true.

1322
1:41:07.161 -> 01:41:10.780
How about Vegas this weekend?
Got any money left?
