<i>Episode 3</i>

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,730
What the heck is he saying?

4
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:24,390
He says that he came to make sure
that they weren't coming for him.

5
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:32,590
She needs to know who he is
in order to trust him.

6
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,610
You weren't sleeping?

7
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:44,970
But then he met a girl yesterday.
Her name is Cha Eun Sang.

8
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,830
How do you know my name?

9
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:51,070
There's something he wants to ask
Cha Eun Sang.

10
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,190
Do I...

11
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,840
Do I like you?

12
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,340
- Probably not.
- Why not?

13
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,460
You are engaged.

14
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,070
Nevertheless.

15
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,870
That's like a movie.

16
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,880
We're in Hollywood.

17
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,080
They really happen in real life.

18
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,300
Really?

19
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,040
We're in Hollywood?

20
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,240
What?

21
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,460
It's really Hollywood!

22
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:09,200
It's so cool. I saw that in the movies!

23
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:13,730
What I said in the theater can't
possibly be less cool than that.

24
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,380
I always said to myself that I would
go see it when I got to America.

25
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,160
Am I talking by myself?

26
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,320
It may seem close,
but it's actually far away, right?

27
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,520
It already seems far away!

28
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:38,420
Go wash up at home and take my
car there. You can't walk there.

29
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,900
I'm not going.

30
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,760
Why not? I will take you there.

31
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,140
No, you did so much for me already.

32
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:53,730
I don't want to trouble you anymore.

33
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,720
Let's go home.
My suitcase is at your place.

34
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,350
Which way are we going?

35
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,020
Sorry for troubling you again.

36
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:56,930
But can you check if there's a comment yet?

37
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:07,700
Thanks for everything.
Good bye.

38
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:21,800
<i>America? Where in America?
I'm in America too!</i>

39
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:26,030
<i>What's going on? I will go right now
so call me as soon as you see this.</i>

40
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:29,170
<i>This is my number!
Call me right away!</i>

41
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,680
Where's my suitcase?

42
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,750
It was all broken.
What happened?

43
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,220
- Where is it?
- Upstairs in my room.

44
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:58,390
I'm going to take a shower.
Go take it if you want.

45
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:06,430
Stay here until your friend or whatever
leaves a comment. Then it'll be fine.

46
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:09,450
I'm going to take a shower then.

47
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:22,970
<i>I ate lunch alone.
Let's eat dinner together.</i>

48
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,710
Yes, Secretary Yoon.

49
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:36,820
There's a family party with the American
shareholders at a ranch villa.

50
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:41,510
Your father wants you to be there.
It's tomorrow at lunch.

51
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,500
Your brother must be at the ranch by now.

52
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,780
Does he know that I'm coming?

53
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:52,210
Your father wants you to go.

54
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,520
But not my brother?

55
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,250
<i>If you want to know what he thinks, then
you'll have to go there and ask him yourself.</i>

56
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:04,420
<i>That's the message I had to deliver.
Good luck.</i>

57
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,760
Thank you.

58
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,710
Father!

59
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,830
It's Mr. Yoon!

60
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:33,860
- What are you doing at school during summer break?
- I'm preparing for a film event. What about you, Father?

61
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,400
I had business to attend to.
It's Mr. Yoon!

62
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,240
Chan Young must have met the
Enlightenment in America. He's not calling me.

63
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,070
He's talking to American girls.
I think he's cheating on me.

64
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:48,950
Really? My son is a jerk!

65
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,530
How could you call my boyfriend a jerk?

66
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:55,180
You better watch Chan Young!
He likes girls too.

67
00:06:55,180 --> 00:07:00,290
It's the girls that like him first!
You know that Cha Eun Sang or whatever.

68
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:03,150
I don't like her! So don't be nice to her!

69
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:06,330
Have a safe trip home, Father.

70
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:11,020
- It's Ahjusshi! (Mr. Yoon)
- That's Won Bin. (who starred in the film, 'Ahjusshi.')

71
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,920
Hi.

72
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,580
You're not greeting me properly.

73
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,450
Hi.

74
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:27,530
- What's all this?
- Eat them, Hyo Shin.

75
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:30,300
We woke up early
and put in a lot of effort.

76
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,430
You got the roll in Cheongdamdong,
the rib eye in Bangbaedong

77
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:36,630
the egg-pancakes in Chongro, and the
salad and the dessert in Itaewon.

78
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:40,680
Exactly what did you make?
You woke up early to get the spoon in?

79
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,710
Do you know how many people are on the team?
How can you bring only this much?

80
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:48,030
Gosh... so I might as well buy a
broadcast station or something for him.

81
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,830
This is just a journalism team.

82
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,970
What? Just a journalism team?

83
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:54,760
My father is the president of SBC.

84
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,570
My father is the president of Mega Head.

85
00:07:56,570 --> 00:08:00,970
You want to see what happens when my agency
takes away all the celebrities from SBC?

86
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:02,540
What the heck?

87
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,260
Let's go.

88
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:08,040
Everything is good about you, but...

89
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,030
This is even better.

90
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:13,190
- What's this present for?
- It's my 100th day.

91
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,150
What?

92
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:17,530
With whom?

93
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,740
- 100 days until the exam.
- What the heck?

94
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,960
So take a seat.

95
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:31,400
The freshman director wants to quit.

96
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,480
His family must have found out
that he was on the team.

97
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,560
He was always afraid of getting caught.

98
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,600
You really hid it well from your
family for three years.

99
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:44,210
I don't know if it's me hiding it well
or my parents hiding it well.

100
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,670
That's depressing.

101
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,570
What medicine is that?

102
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,480
Vitamins.

103
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,520
You will need it next year. My body
is not the same as it was at 18.

104
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:57,570
Oh my God.

105
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:01,740
What's that bag for?

106
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:05,240
Let's go to Hollywood next time.
I have to go somewhere.

107
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,900
- What's going on? Is it bad?
- Don't go anywhere and stay here.

108
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,710
No, I should go.
I already gave you enough trouble.

109
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:14,130
You always say that you should go
when you don't have a place to go.

110
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:17,270
Don't you ever talk about leaving again.
Or I'm going to sell you.

111
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,680
Hey guys!

112
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,210
Hey, Jay!

113
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:25,230
Uh-oh! My sweet angel's at this house?

114
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,330
- This afternoon...
- Tammy and her boyfriend were here!

115
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:35,750
They came to the hospital too. Don't
worry about it! I've got it taken care of.

116
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,630
Anyway, where are you going?

117
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:44,220
Is my sweet angel staying with me?

118
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:49,300
Do you get car sick?

119
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:03,110
<i>- Where are you going?
- Sleep if you're tired.</i>

120
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:06,830
<i>It's going to take a while.</i>

121
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,740
So when is she going to divorce him?

122
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:04,070
Lower your voice!

123
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,510
Are you making announcements?
People are listening!

124
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:12,320
Listen to me, affairs make the
best lawsuit for a divorce.

125
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,810
I know some P.I.'s that can take
some good X-rated pictures.

126
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:18,780
I will go get them for you, so
get some guys on her tomorrow.

127
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:22,970
But technically, I was his mistress.

128
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,600
But you gave birth to his son!

129
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:30,520
Oh is that how it works?

130
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,680
Do I call this number?

131
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,900
Yes, the name is Jung Ji Sook.

132
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,000
She's usually at the gallery in
Apgujeong in the afternoon.

133
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,560
Yes! Affairs!

134
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:53,910
Yes, you know what you're talking about.
Yes, those kinds of pictures...

135
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:56,510
Oh my God.

136
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,000
I will call you back.

137
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:13,460
How long were you there for?
Were you eavesdropping?

138
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,520
<i>I wasn't eavesdropping.
I could just hear you.</i>

139
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:21,480
If I was on the phone, then you should
have made yourself known!

140
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,700
You could tell I was
being very secretive.

141
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:32,370
<i>I wrote a message and was holding it up.</i>

142
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:36,060
<i>If you're lucky, you won't be caught.</i>

143
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:39,570
<i>But you should have used
a pre-paid phone for that.</i>

144
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:41,850
Pre-paid phone?

145
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:46,410
Why are you telling me this now?

146
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:51,330
Don't write it! Don't!

147
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,910
Don't you dare to write, 'You didn't ask.'

148
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:17,970
Are we there yet?

149
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,730
I'll be back.

150
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:27,000
- How long is it going to take?
- I don't know.

151
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:31,070
I may get kicked out in just five minutes
or get kicked out later than that.

152
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,980
You should look around if you're bored.
But watch out for one person.

153
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,430
- Who?
- The coldest looking person here.

154
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,020
Coldest looking person?

155
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,240
<i>So we can play around for the Rangers!</i>

156
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:05,640
- I will definitely win next time.
- Cheers.

157
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:26,600
Excuse me, who is that?

158
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:43,220
Excuse me.

159
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:51,670
- Won.
- Come with me.

160
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:28,840
- It's been a long time.
- Who called you? Was it Yoon?

161
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:32,140
How have you been?

162
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,650
He really called you?

163
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,280
And you thought you could come here?

164
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,210
How could I not?
You were here.

165
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,460
I don't care what you say now
since I saw you...

166
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,830
This is why kids are troublesome.

167
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,450
How could you come just
because you missed me?

168
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,960
You don't even realize what this means.

169
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,640
It's been three years.

170
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,930
I've gotten taller.

171
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,710
That's it?

172
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:08,740
That's all you've gotten in America.

173
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:14,300
You should stop right here. You've
already done more than you deserve.

174
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:18,290
Go.

175
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:55,160
Are you okay?

176
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,180
I'm not okay.

177
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,260
You're going to get wet.

178
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,710
Why were you eavesdropping?

179
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:07,740
I was going to run with you on the count
of three if you were in danger.

180
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:11,230
Then why didn't you do it?

181
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:14,920
I was in danger the whole time
you were watching.

182
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,880
What?

183
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:05,700
It's just awfully quiet.

184
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,510
Should I turn on the radio?

185
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:16,100
Forget what you saw earlier.

186
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:20,270
I was going to anyway.

187
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:27,720
It's all a dream anyway.
One summer night dream.

188
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:52,830
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

189
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:55,490
- What was it?
- Fallen rocks.

190
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:57,580
This happens often here.

191
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,330
What happened?
The car broke?

192
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:10,550
Stay in the car. We'll be in trouble
when the sun goes down.

193
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:21,180
What the heck? This is like the first
scene of a horror movie!

194
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:39,510
What now?

195
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:43,900
There's no reception here.

196
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,680
- Can you drive?
- Huh?

197
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,960
Hey push harder!

198
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,360
- Harder!
- I am!

199
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,760
Let's try it one more time.

200
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:08,310
One, two, three!

201
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:27,340
What do we do now?

202
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:35,990
We have no choice. We have
to give up on the car for now.

203
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:39,150
Get the important things in
your bag like your passport.

204
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,080
It's all in here, but why?

205
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,160
We have to find shelter
before the sun goes down.

206
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:47,630
That's the only way
to call for help.

207
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:52,000
Can't we stay here? People always die
from going to the wrong places in movies!

208
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:56,030
'Texas Chainsaw Massacre.'
'Friday the Thirteenth,' 'Scream!'

209
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:58,610
'Hello Sydney.'
Don't you know?

210
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:01,390
Then you can stay here.

211
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:04,400
Let me go with you!
The person who stays alone dies!

212
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,520
So we know the ending already?

213
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:10,410
One has to survive for the sequel!

214
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,250
I'm hungry.
Do you know the way?

215
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:42,500
- There is no other way.
- It could be the opposite direction.

216
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,240
I saw a road house on the way here.

217
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:52,350
I bought this earlier.
I had forgotten.

218
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,390
- You only bought one?
- No, two.

219
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:58,360
One is for my mom.

220
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:01,810
Stop spending lavishly!

221
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,440
Here.

222
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,660
I'm not saying this because I want
to eat it. The manager said...

223
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,420
Never mind.

224
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:14,440
The guy you asked for help from...

225
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,160
- He left a comment?
- I didn't finish my question.

226
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,760
Finish it.

227
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:22,060
What are you going to do when you see him?

228
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,610
I have to borrow money first.

229
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:26,830
My sister stole all of my money, so I
don't have any for the plane ticket.

230
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,500
I can lend you money too.

231
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,070
With my kidney as the security? I
don't have the courage for that.

232
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:35,040
- You can try.
- You trust me?

233
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:41,780
- He left a comment.
- Really? When?

234
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:45,330
Why are you telling me this now? Let me
see your phone. Do we get internet here?

235
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:47,450
We're not even getting reception.
Of course there's no internet.

236
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:49,790
What do we do then? Huh?

237
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:51,500
Look at that!

238
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:04,010
<i>We're closed for tonight.
Maybe tomorrow morning.</i>

239
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:06,420
Other places will be the same!

240
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:10,370
If you decide to stay here tonight,
I'll book the tow.

241
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:12,900
Just a minute.

242
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,280
What is this?

243
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,360
I got it from the souvenir shop.
Put it on.

244
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,960
I can't sleep in this.

245
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,900
Does he think that
we're a couple at a motel?

246
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,170
Don't even dream about it.

247
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,600
Change and come out.
Let's eat something.

248
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:09,640
Dang it, I should have seen it.

249
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:16,260
- That looks good.
- Yeah, thanks.

250
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:20,220
This is the best they could do,
because they are already closed.

251
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,420
This is more than enough.
Thank you.

252
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:27,120
There are drinks!

253
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,980
- You drink?
- Haven't you seen my hands shaking all this time?

254
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:34,110
- You're cute.
- I know.

255
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:52,690
Stop staring at me. Or I'm going
to ask you awkward questions.

256
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:54,400
What awkward questions?

257
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:58,290
Like, who was the man I saw at the ranch?

258
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:00,940
Yeah.

259
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:08,880
The person I like the most in the world.

260
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:12,510
Anything else?

261
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,300
Are you...

262
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:20,460
Never mind.

263
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:24,180
Insult me, but don't insult my brother.

264
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,690
Oh, he was your brother.

265
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:27,420
- Then you like your...
- Hey!

266
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,000
You dummy.

267
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:48,350
- What?
- You could've gotten hurt.

268
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:54,470
It was your fault!
I was only joking.

269
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:56,660
Why are you blushing?

270
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:00,360
- You have a dirty mind.
- I was not blushing!

271
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,800
It's because I couldn't even
eat a pancake in America.

272
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,220
Pancake?

273
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:11,340
In American movies, they drink pancakes
with syrup and orange juice.

274
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:14,990
That looks very American.
To me at least.

275
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:17,580
Such a cliche.

276
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:21,390
I know a good pancake place on Melrose.
Let's go when we go back to L.A.

277
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,640
Come on.

278
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,990
Don't make promises! The person
who makes a promise always dies!

279
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:29,460
Never mind. It's only scarier if
I think about these things.

280
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:32,100
I should focus on the sausage.

281
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,120
You're scarier!

282
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:42,210
- I'm using the bed.
- Of course.

283
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:44,610
I'm just glad that I could sleep here.

284
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:49,340
How can you be so positive? You were
here in the first place because of me.

285
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:52,620
How is it because of you? It's because
of the fallen rocks. Good night!

286
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:04,230
Are you asleep?

287
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:09,160
Are you really asleep?

288
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:32,410
You're bad at acting. Wake up,
I've got something to ask you.

289
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:35,970
- If you don't wake up...
- What? What is it?

290
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:40,160
- Why do you want Jeguk Group to go bankrupt?
- What?

291
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:44,320
- You read my SNS?
- Why not? You logged in for me.

292
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,200
Why were you looking?
Log out before I go crazy.

293
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,420
You really want them to go bankrupt?

294
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:51,980
- But why?
- Why do you care?

295
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,910
You have Jeguk Group shares?

296
00:28:56,140 --> 00:29:00,270
- Never mind. Watch me until I fall asleep.
- What?

297
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:03,880
I'm scared because you kept
talking about horror movies.

298
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:07,840
- Sleep after I fall asleep. That's the price for the room.
- Price for the room?

299
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,870
You said that I was involved
in this because of you!

300
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:13,520
It was because of the fallen rocks.

301
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:15,560
Dang it.

302
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,590
Just look at me.
Don't get any dirty thoughts.

303
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:21,810
Hey! You're not my type at all!

304
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:25,290
Exactly. I take a while
before I fall asleep.

305
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:29,560
- So I should go to bed first.
- I have a lot of thoughts.

306
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,890
And I sleep a lot.

307
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:43,790
When are you going to Korea
after you contact your friend?

308
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:47,380
As soon as possible.

309
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:52,130
What if...

310
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:56,780
I...

311
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:00,860
<i>Thank you for the address.
And for contacting me.</i>

312
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:03,660
Then take her away.

313
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:16,740
- Let's go.
- Can I see your phone real quick?

314
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:20,330
- If I can only contact my friend...
- But you still have to see him somewhere.

315
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:22,530
Are you going to wait for him on a street?

316
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:28,930
Cha Eun Sang!

317
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,290
Chan Young!

318
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:37,710
Yoon Chan Young!

319
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:40,170
What happened?
How are you here?

320
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:42,520
You were going to America?

321
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,550
What happened to you?
Why didn't you call me?

322
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:46,830
You didn't get my message?
I was worried about you!

323
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:49,730
I'm sorry, I will explain later.

324
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:53,200
I'm finally relieved.
I can't believe this, Chan Young!

325
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:57,770
- Hey...
- It's hot! You can tell me inside.

326
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,160
Who is he? And what's
up with that shirt?

327
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,990
- What is this place?
- Let's go in and say good bye first.

328
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:28,170
Thank you for everything.

329
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:30,990
I'm going to my friend's place now.

330
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:32,980
- Why?
- Huh?

331
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:35,850
Just stay.
You can just borrow his money.

332
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:38,040
Why do you have to go?

333
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,970
I have no reason to stay here.

334
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:42,990
Then how about this?

335
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:45,560
You went to the police station
because of my friend.

336
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:49,120
Because the cop knew me, he didn't trust
you and your passport was confiscated.

337
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,360
And you couldn't book a flight or hotel
because you didn't have your passport.

338
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,430
Is that true?

339
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:58,300
Staying at my place is the rightful
compensation that you deserve.

340
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:01,630
So you don't need to go.

341
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:06,520
- Do we have a problem?
- What if we do?

342
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:09,850
No, we don't have a problem.

343
00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:14,710
Even if everything you say is true,
I'm still thankful for everything you've done.

344
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:17,790
And I got my passport back.

345
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,810
Are you...

346
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:24,600
Kim Tan?

347
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,410
- You know me?
- You know me.

348
00:34:26,410 --> 00:34:28,310
Who are you?

349
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:34,670
By any chance... did I bully you in
middle school?

350
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:36,690
It's not that simple.

351
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:39,800
Let's go. The cab is here.

352
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,600
Okay.

353
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:47,560
I will go then.

354
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,160
Bye.

355
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,900
So you've been staying
at his place ever since then?

356
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:32,930
I had no choice.
I didn't have money or my passport.

357
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:35,320
No one was at my sister's place.

358
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:38,150
- By the way, is his name Kim Tan?
- You didn't know?

359
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:40,930
I didn't ask him, because I didn't
want to tell him about me.

360
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:45,200
Is he a bad guy?
Did he bully you?

361
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:48,450
I just know his name.

362
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:51,560
He's not a nice guy.
Let's go in.

363
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:07,180
So what happened to Eun Suk?

364
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:09,950
I don't know.
She ran away.

365
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:15,070
That horrible girl.
What do I tell Mom now?

366
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:18,610
- Don't worry about the plane ticket.
- Thank you.

367
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:21,590
- I will pay you back when I get back...
- Slow down.

368
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:24,250
Thank you.

369
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:28,030
- What time does the travel agency open?
- Slow down with that too.

370
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:32,060
There's only one thing that you need
to do in a hurry. Choose the menu.

371
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:34,850
What do you want for dinner?

372
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:38,050
There's something I really
want to eat.

373
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:41,550
Ddukbokki. (Spicy rice cake)

374
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,920
- Is it good?
- Yeah, it's good.

375
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:50,000
- That's so pretty!
- Let's take a picture.

376
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:51,740
Okay.

377
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,720
One, two, three!

378
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,190
[Chan Young posted a picture.
With Cha Eun Sung]

379
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:57,640
That's good.

380
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,460
- You're posting it on your SNS?
- Yeah.

381
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:03,340
- I wanted to show you something funny.
- What is it?

382
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:06,440
- Count to three.
- One, two, three.

383
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:11,560
[Bo Na]
See? Isn't she cute?

384
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:15,500
I'm going to kill you! You want to
see Lee Bo Na pulling my hair out?

385
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:18,570
- That should be fun.
- I'm going to kill you!

386
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:20,210
One sec.
Hello?

387
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:21,630
<i>Hey, are you out of your mind?</i>

388
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:24,580
<i>What's Cha Eun Sang doing there?
What are you two doing?</i>

389
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:28,420
I'm thinking about you!
What else is there to do?

390
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:33,700
I'm jealous.

391
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,740
Whatever.

392
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,570
It's so annoying!

393
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:51,590
It's tomorrow.

394
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:03,500
This way please.

395
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,940
[My Tan]

396
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:18,470
- What?
- Where are you?

397
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:19,700
Why do you care?

398
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:23,480
<i>I think it's about time you packed
your stuff and went back to Korea.</i>

399
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:26,490
You're wrong.
I'm already in Korea.

400
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:29,190
Oh yeah?

401
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,950
Then come back to America.

402
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:50,220
Take back the luggage again. And
change the flight for tomorrow.

403
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,380
Tomorrow?

404
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:54,850
I don't think he's gonna see me
the day after tomorrow.

405
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,820
Yes ma'am.

406
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:01,830
One second.

407
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:04,860
[Mom]

408
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:07,870
- Yeah, it's me.
- Are you with Tan?

409
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:09,870
Yeah, I'm with him.

410
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:12,780
He dressed up and came to see me.

411
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:20,060
Then just listen to me.

412
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:23,580
I'm not telling people that you went to America
because you missed him so much.

413
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:25,110
It was because Tan asked you to come.

414
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:26,920
<i>Why would you do that?</i>

415
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:29,890
Bye, your mother-in-law is coming.

416
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:37,660
Hi, I'm sorry if I asked you to
see me too early in the morning.

417
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,320
You're the busy person.
There's no helping it.

418
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:47,940
- But it was hard.
- This is the only time that I'm free.

419
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:53,310
How come you always dress better when
I'm the one working in the fashion industry?

420
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:57,340
You gave birth to Tan so late.
How can you keep a body like that?

421
00:40:57,340 --> 00:41:01,440
I was born with it.
I've also spent a lot of time and money.

422
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,100
I heard that Rachel went to America.

423
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:07,440
She went to see her fiance right
when her summer break started.

424
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,650
She's so cute.

425
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:15,610
The reason I wanted to see you today was
because... I'm sure you've already heard...

426
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:18,010
I'm getting married.

427
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:20,930
I thought that I should tell my
in-laws before hand.

428
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:24,900
I've heard.
It's President Choi Dong Woo of Hotel Zeus.

429
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,230
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

430
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:31,000
- Choi's son also goes to our school.
- Yes, Young Do.

431
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:34,180
I wanted to ask you...

432
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:37,590
Did something happen between
Tan and Young Do?

433
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:42,580
Rachel said that they are probably
not friends anymore.

434
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:48,830
They were best friends
until they went to America.

435
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:58,990
Everything is ruined because you opened
the door at the decisive moment.

436
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,860
Look how you ruined the films!

437
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:07,500
Pity! I could have been the
next Henry Cartier-Bresson.

438
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:12,210
'I spent my entire life trying to capture
the decisive moment.'

439
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:21,590
'But every moment in life
was the decisive moment.'

440
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:23,870
What the hell are you saying?

441
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:29,960
They are the quotes of Henry Cartier-Bresson,
your role model.

442
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,490
You should know who he is
first at least.

443
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,590
I'm going to kill you.

444
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:46,370
<i>[Father]</i>

445
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:53,600
Yes?

446
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:02,580
He wasn't even
the hotel general manager.

447
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:06,640
You couldn't even handle a kitchen
manager and made him complain?

448
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,570
Get up.

449
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:18,980
You want to know why
you always lose?

450
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:21,990
First, it's because you've
never beaten me.

451
00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:27,240
Maybe it's because I'm more like Mom,
when I should've been more like you.

452
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:36,470
Second, you attack excessively.

453
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:39,460
On the mat and off the mat.

454
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:45,550
Rachel is coming today.
Go pick her up at the airport.

455
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:59,630
Thank you!
I've always wanted to have it.

456
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:02,070
Can't you sound more sincere?

457
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:05,200
You and I both can't be moved by
something bought with money.

458
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:09,250
What you gave me today wasn't these
clothes, but your time.

459
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:11,630
The time you took to shop with me.

460
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:14,410
I know that you hate shopping.
Thank you for today.

461
00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:17,930
You don't need to thank me.
I like shopping with you.

462
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:21,130
Because if we do anything else,
I feel like we're really dating.

463
00:45:24,410 --> 00:45:25,940
Did she leave?

464
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:30,230
- Yesterday.
- Did she leave or did you kick her out?

465
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:34,610
It happened as you planned it.
You gave him my address, didn't you?

466
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:37,040
Let's not talk about her.

467
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,070
You brought it up.

468
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:48,200
Hello.

469
00:45:50,110 --> 00:45:52,200
Choi Young Do?

470
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:57,200
Are you a kid?
You can't come alone?

471
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:00,320
Change the flight schedule or
live in America.

472
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:02,960
Make sure that I don't have to
come pick you up.

473
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:09,640
Make sure that I don't have to call you
for this again. Do you understand?

474
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:20,530
Crazy bastard.

475
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:24,890
Have you heard?
He's going to be my step-brother.

476
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:26,930
I heard.

477
00:46:27,710 --> 00:46:30,160
How is Young Do doing?

478
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,320
He's doing well.

479
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:34,720
He's doing all the stuff
that you two were doing together.

480
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:41,960
I'm annoyed. It's our anniversary and
Choi Young Do ruined it.

481
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,110
Let's go eat something sweet.

482
00:46:44,110 --> 00:46:46,600
How about the pancake place
on Melrose that you like?

483
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:51,760
<i>I've seen people eating pancakes with syrup
and orange juice on American movies.</i>

484
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:54,920
- That's the American style.
- Such a cliche.

485
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:59,090
I know a good place on Melrose.
Let's go when we get back to L.A.

486
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:03,400
- Let's go somewhere else.
- Why?

487
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:07,070
- I think she's going to be there.
- Who?

488
00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:10,450
- That girl?
- Yeah.

489
00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:14,320
Did you have a premonition
or something?

490
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:16,680
Do you know how big L.A. is
compared to Seoul?

491
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:21,330
And you think you're going to
run into her there?

492
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,250
It's just a feeling.

493
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:26,150
Also we can't get a table there without
a reservation at this hour.

494
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:29,020
- Let's go somewhere else.
- Let's go to see if she's there.

495
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:32,030
Now I really want to check.

496
00:47:56,970 --> 00:47:59,020
She's really here.

497
00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:02,750
You're almost an American now!
When did you make a reservation?

498
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:07,360
It's the basics. But how do you know
this place? Did you look it up online?

499
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:10,210
Huh? Something like that.

500
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:28,710
You didn't tell her to come here did you?

501
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:30,410
Let's go somewhere else.

502
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:31,850
Let's just eat.

503
00:48:31,850 --> 00:48:33,940
I'm trying to be somewhat decent for you.

504
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:38,830
You're so annoying. How is not
seeing her being decent to me?

505
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:42,230
- Let's go! I want to eat!
- There are no tables!

506
00:48:45,370 --> 00:48:47,270
We can make a table.

507
00:48:47,850 --> 00:48:51,380
Let's see if this is a coincidence or fate.

508
00:48:56,500 --> 00:49:00,280
- Did you make a reservation?
- I have someone waiting.

509
00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:12,090
You're White Hacker Yoon.
I'm going to sit. We will pay the bill.

510
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:18,190
You two know each other?

511
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:20,630
She goes to my school,
but we're not friends.

512
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:22,420
This is our first time talking.

513
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:25,990
He's a lower social class,
so I never talked to him.

514
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:29,810
Get up.

515
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:34,670
It's our engagement anniversary today.

516
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:40,290
Kim Tan! You can have the
pancake you like so much.

517
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:44,060
Fine, let's have it.

518
00:49:44,490 --> 00:49:46,560
I really want some.

519
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:56,220
How do you two know
each other?

520
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:59,080
- Childhood friends.
- Oh yeah?

521
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,910
But why did you come here?

522
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:02,600
Did you take her here because
it's a famous restaurant?

523
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:06,130
No, she wanted to come here.

524
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:13,210
Wow, what a coincidence.

525
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:16,560
But my fiance and her seem to think
that this is some kind of fate.

526
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:20,000
- What do you think Yoon Chan Young?
- I thought you wanted to eat pancakes.

527
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,260
Stop.

528
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:23,460
No one's saying anything else!

529
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:28,290
Oh? How about this then?
You went out with Lee Bo Na too.

530
00:50:28,290 --> 00:50:31,730
Say hi. This is Lee Bo Na's current boyfriend.

531
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:33,870
This is her ex-boyfriend.

532
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:37,150
Do you have to talk about someone
who's not here like that?

533
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:41,100
Then what are you doing with her
and not Lee Bo Na? It was your fault.

534
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:47,700
Actually... it's your fault for seeing guys
with a girlfriend or a fiancee.

535
00:50:49,110 --> 00:50:51,380
- Yoo Rachel!
- Excuse us.

536
00:50:53,590 --> 00:50:55,170
Let's go.

537
00:51:02,170 --> 00:51:03,620
What do you want me to do?

538
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:06,930
Get involved or just pretend
that I didn't see anything?

539
00:51:09,510 --> 00:51:13,810
Order. Let's eat and go buy
the plane ticket.

540
00:51:13,810 --> 00:51:16,830
Stay for a few more days.
You came all the way here.

541
00:51:16,830 --> 00:51:19,350
I have to go.
I'm also worried about Mom.

542
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:21,740
I have to work so I can pay you back.

543
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:24,840
I told you!
You can take your time!

544
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:28,240
Don't look at me like that.
We're still in America.

545
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:38,580
You can let go and talk! You were
tough enough in front of her.

546
00:51:39,290 --> 00:51:41,140
- Yoo Rachel.
- What?

547
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:44,410
We first met when we were ten.

548
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:51,350
I thought that you were a genius, because a
ten-year-old could talk in English and Japanese.

549
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,920
When you were 14,
you liked my brother.

550
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:57,470
You said that you couldn't like me
because I'm a baby.

551
00:51:57,470 --> 00:51:58,890
So what do you want to say?

552
00:51:58,890 --> 00:52:02,410
You said that when they were
talking about our engagement.

553
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:05,850
Our world is small enough.
There is no better match.

554
00:52:05,850 --> 00:52:10,130
That's when I realized that
I really was a baby.

555
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:11,860
And?

556
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:14,860
For eight years, you were always
the smartest person to me.

557
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:17,960
You were pretty and mature, but...

558
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:21,250
you're hard to bear right now.

559
00:52:21,790 --> 00:52:26,810
Don't do that.
Especially if it's because of me.

560
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:32,560
I'm not worth you ruining yourself.

561
00:52:36,410 --> 00:52:38,280
You said that you were
leaving tomorrow.

562
00:52:38,710 --> 00:52:41,960
I will pick you up at your hotel.
I will see you tomorrow.

563
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:03,000
- Won?
- Rachel.

564
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,150
What are you doing here? I thought you
were staying at Young Do's hotel.

565
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:08,190
I would never stay there.

566
00:53:08,190 --> 00:53:11,690
It looks like you're here,
because you didn't like it there.

567
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:15,890
Yeah. It's good to see you.
How are you?

568
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:17,770
I'm okay.

569
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:20,470
Did you see Tan?

570
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:24,500
Something like that.
You?

571
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:28,480
Same here.
Something like that.

572
00:53:29,070 --> 00:53:32,210
- Are you going somewhere?
- Yeah, I need to go somewhere.

573
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:36,620
Can I go with you unless it's a date
or an important meeting?

574
00:53:36,790 --> 00:53:39,970
- You're not going to like it.
- I don't care.

575
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:44,150
It's going to be better than looking at
my phone in my hotel room alone.

576
00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:48,770
The sun is out too long here. It makes
a lonely person feel even lonelier.

577
00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:52,190
I'm going pretty far from here.
Is that okay with you?

578
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,840
That's even better.

579
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:07,830
- Who is she?
- My mom.

580
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:15,380
She's from a country where she made wine and
harvested oranges until she met my father.

581
00:54:15,590 --> 00:54:19,510
The suffocating tycoon in-laws
and superficial parties...

582
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:23,640
Korea was hell for a country girl
from America.

583
00:54:24,330 --> 00:54:27,210
She ended up coming back like this.

584
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:31,400
She made wine herself?

585
00:54:32,630 --> 00:54:36,050
In my family wine cellar,
there's a wine called 'Won.'

586
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:39,380
She made that
on the year I was born.

587
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:44,730
That's beautiful.
Did Tan come here with you too?

588
00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:49,180
No, you are the first person.

589
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:51,940
- Why?
- Tan would be jealous.

590
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:54,490
- Of whom? Me?
- No.

591
00:54:54,490 --> 00:54:58,500
Of me.
I'm glad that I came with you.

592
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:01,790
I like that I don't have to
talk to myself thanks to you.

593
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:04,510
Pretend that you read my secret diary.

594
00:55:22,490 --> 00:55:24,270
Yes?

595
00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:26,130
I'm staying for a few more days.

596
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:30,100
Please tell my father
that I'm stopping by Singapore.

597
00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:33,890
Oh yeah, I saw Tan thanks to you.

598
00:55:33,890 --> 00:55:36,660
Please make sure to tell Tan
about my schedule again.

599
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:40,300
Don't worry about that. I don't interfere
with your personal schedule.

600
00:55:45,010 --> 00:55:46,960
I will see you at the airport.

601
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,450
Young Do is going to the airport?

602
00:56:04,450 --> 00:56:05,910
I told him to go.

603
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:09,220
- He must have hated it.
- He has no choice.

604
00:56:09,810 --> 00:56:12,740
He can't disobey me yet.

605
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:16,480
Don't get too confident.
Kids grow up really fast.

606
00:56:19,070 --> 00:56:21,280
- Call me.
- Okay.

607
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:29,020
- Long time no see.
- Yeah.

608
00:56:29,290 --> 00:56:32,000
- How are you?
- Good, just like you.

609
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:34,860
- That's pretty hard.
- I heard that you are getting married.

610
00:56:34,860 --> 00:56:36,870
- Is that him?
- Yeah.

611
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:41,380
It wasn't you 20 years ago.
It's not you this time either.

612
00:56:41,850 --> 00:56:44,740
Congratulations.

613
00:56:47,390 --> 00:56:49,160
Strange isn't it?

614
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:54,540
My heart still races when I see you.

615
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:57,040
I hope you feel the same
after you get married.

616
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,810
Stay well.

617
00:57:12,830 --> 00:57:15,480
- Yes?
- Yes, Secretary Yoon.

618
00:57:16,210 --> 00:57:17,810
Did Won return to Korea?

619
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:21,840
- He should be on the plane right now.
- Oh I see.

620
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:24,690
I heard that you've met my son.

621
00:57:25,130 --> 00:57:26,820
I did?

622
00:57:27,150 --> 00:57:29,380
Who's your son?

623
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,960
Oh! I think I have.

624
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:37,200
His name is Chan Young right?

625
00:57:37,910 --> 00:57:41,110
- You're Secretary Yoon's son?
- You remember now?

626
00:57:41,110 --> 00:57:43,980
- How did you get my number?
- You wrote it in your comment.

627
00:57:43,990 --> 00:57:46,540
- Let me talk to Cha Eun Sang.
- She's not with me right now.

628
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:49,850
- Where is she?
- Just tell me. I can take a message.

629
00:57:49,850 --> 00:57:54,960
Are you her lawyer? I'm going to tell her
myself. Tell her that when she comes back.

630
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:02,920
- What did she say? She didn't call?
- No.

631
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:06,660
I told her to ask for me when she calls.
In the English words that you taught me.

632
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:10,060
Yeah let's wait for her. She must
have her own situation.

633
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:17,000
He just called.
He asked to have you call him back.

634
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:20,330
He says that he has something
to tell you.

635
00:58:25,070 --> 00:58:28,860
No, I don't want to call him.
I won't ever see him again anyway.

636
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:33,680
- What time was your flight tomorrow?
- Don't even think about it.

637
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:36,710
You remember how much I wanted
to come here to study?

638
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:40,570
Skipping class in front of me
is mocking me.

639
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:43,820
- I'm going to go alone.
- Hey! I wasn't taking you anyway.

640
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:47,470
What? I'll kill you! Hey!

641
01:00:21,490 --> 01:00:26,370
<i>It was like a summer night dream.
It's time for me to disappear now.</i>

642
01:00:26,370 --> 01:00:31,010
<i>Like the dream last night.
Farewell.</i>

643
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:38,380
Thank you, sir.

644
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:47,420
Let's go. We won't have too much
time after your duty-free shopping.

645
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:50,730
- I'm not comfortable going with you.
- Bear with it.

646
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:53,010
At least I'm good looking.

647
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:02,220
Go. Text me when you arrive.

648
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:05,400
Are you planning on coming back to Korea?

649
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:08,390
I always have plans,
but I don't have the courage.

650
01:01:08,390 --> 01:01:10,410
You need courage to go
back to Korea?

651
01:01:10,410 --> 01:01:12,120
Yeah.

652
01:01:12,590 --> 01:01:16,940
Rash boldness.
I need that.

653
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:19,450
Go ahead.

654
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:29,370
I still haven't forgiven you yet.

655
01:01:30,550 --> 01:01:32,650
I really hate you.

656
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:41,380
I know.

657
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:15,770
Cha Eun Sang! Stop right there!

658
01:02:31,830 --> 01:02:41,000

01:02:51,930 --> 01:02:54,300

<i>Let's see how Tan protects his
mother from his brother.</i>

662
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:00,510
I told him that you're still the jerk you are.
[Welcome! my STEP-sister.]

663

<i>Why doesn't a tiger have its own den?</i>

664
01:03:02,890 --> 01:03:05,610
- Let your brother go.
- I'm here.

665
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:07,030
What you're worrying about
will not happen.

666
01:03:07,030 --> 01:03:09,550
That's not for
an illegitimate child to decide.

667
01:03:09,550 --> 01:03:12,300
- This is where we will be staying.
- Are you crazy?

668
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:14,060
- You live here?
- Did Tan move?

669
01:03:14,170 --> 01:03:15,580
<i>Are you blind now?</i>

670
01:03:15,590 --> 01:03:17,780
- I will go.
- Will you? You have to do your part.

<i>I keep seeing a girl's back.</i>
