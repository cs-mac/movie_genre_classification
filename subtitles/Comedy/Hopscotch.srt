1
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,950
Hello, boys!

2
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,950
* Dee dee *

3
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,590
* Bom-bom, bom-bom *

4
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:51,230
* Bom-bom ba-bom-doo *

5
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:57,350
* Bom-bom bom-boom-bom **

6
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,630
Hey, Yaskov. How are ya?

7
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:21,190
Kendig.
What an unexpected pleasure.

8
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:25,590
- May I have it, please?
- Have what?

9
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:28,790
I got it all on film, Yaskov.

10
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,910
You don't wanna deal
with the West Germans.

11
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:33,030
They don't like Russian
Intelligence. You know that.

12
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:35,150
Give it to me,
and we'll forget about it.

13
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:37,830
I could make a run for it.

14
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,870
Come on, Yaskov.
You running, me chasing you?

15
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:43,310
We'd look like
Laurel and Hardy.

16
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,350
Two clowns, huh?

17
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:49,430
You're a good man, Kendig,
the best they've got.

18
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:53,230
- I wish you were with us.
- Thanks, Yaskov.

19
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:55,270
Da Svidaniya.

20
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:10,030
Lufthansa flight 22
arriving at gate 17.

21
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:24,030
Passenger Bernstein,
please go to the courtesy phone.

22
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:27,230
I didn't expect to be met, Joe.
What's the matter?

23
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:31,470
Myerson's in a sweat
because you let that Russian go.

24
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,910
He's talking about
the Russians in Cuba again.

25
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,910
Talking about
sending you to Cuba.

26
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:38,950
- Oh.
- That's why you got the chopper.

27
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:47,270
- Hi, Wanda.
- Good morning.

28
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,270
- How are ya?
- Welcome back.

29
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,590
Hi, Edie. Hi, Sherri.

30
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:54,310
- Beverly, how are you?
- Good morning, Mr. Kendig.

31
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:58,470
In here, Kendig. Cutter, stay put.
I want to see you after this.

32
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:05,710
Hi, Myerson.
I thought you were taller.

33
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:08,590
I don't remember you being this short.
How'd you get so short?

34
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,670
Up yours, Kendig.

35
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,910
Where's your report?
You haven't filed it.

36
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:18,910
I just got off the airplane.
The job's finished. What's the hurry?

37
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:23,870
Typical. It's difficult
growing up, isn't it?

38
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:26,470
Aren't you just a little senior...

39
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:29,390
to be shadowing people around
the streets of Munich personally?

40
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:32,310
I worked on thatjob
for two years.

41
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:34,430
I had a right
to be in at the finish.

42
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,590
You mind ifl sit down?

43
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,750
The object, Kendig,
was to dismantle...

44
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:41,470
the Russian network over there.

45
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,990
All you did was
nab a few small fry...

46
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,990
three clerks
and a cleaning woman.

47
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:49,550
And they blew the whistle on the others.
We got the whole kit and caboodle.

48
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,670
We plugged that leakfor good.

49
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,350
-What about Yaskov?
- What about Yaskov?

50
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,350
What'd you want me to do,
terminate him?

51
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:58,990
Is that the way you did things
in your dirty tricks division?

52
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:01,270
You're too new in this section
to go jumping to conclusions.

53
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:03,350
Excuse me.

54
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,910
- I never intended...
- Get my wife, please.

55
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,910
I never intended
to arrest Yas...

56
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:11,750
- Go ahead.
- I never intended to arrest...

57
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:14,230
Hello, darling.
Beverly tells me you called.

58
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:17,110
Yes, dear. It's about
the dinner party this evening.

59
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:19,350
I wanted to make quite certain
you hadn't forgotten.

60
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:22,270
Oh, no. I haven't forgotten.

61
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,270
- You're a good boy.
- Thank you.

62
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:26,430
- There's one other thing... the house.
- What about the house?

63
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:29,990
- Do we really have to go
down there this summer?

64
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:33,870
If you don't want to go, we just
won't go. It's your decision.

65
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,950
Decisions, decisions. Why do I
find it so hard to make up my mind?

66
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:40,070
Excuse me. Excuse me.

67
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:42,270
- Hello? Hello?
- Don't do that?

68
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:45,990
- Can you hear me?
- Yes, dear, I can hear you.

69
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,990
Now listen. Just call
that real estate dame...

70
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:50,070
and tell her to rent it out.

71
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:53,950
- Yes, dear, immediately.
- Tell her no kids, no pets, no Democrats.

72
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:56,390
Yes, dear.
Oh, one last thing.

73
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:59,550
The dinner is formal. I called
Mrs. Blandforth to make certain.

74
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:01,990
Good. I can wear
my new tuxedo.

75
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:05,270
- Good-bye, darling.
- Good-bye, dear.

76
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:08,590
- May I say something now?
- We've got a house near Savannah.

77
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,870
She won't give it up.
Says it's close to her mother.

78
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,870
She never wants
to use it though.

79
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:17,670
I never intended to arrest Yaskov.
I wanted him to stay right where he is.

80
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,710
You wanted.

81
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,350
Yes, I wanted.

82
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:25,310
I've know the man for 20 years. I
know how he thinks. I know how he acts.

83
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:27,750
We take him out,
they put another man in.

84
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,790
It takes us six months
to find out who.

85
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,950
It takes us another year and a half
to learn his style.

86
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:35,670
There are Russian combat troops
90 miles off our shore.

87
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:39,710
You had the head ofthe entire
K. G. B. for western Europe...

88
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,910
in your hand,
and you let him go.

89
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,990
That's the bottom line, isn't it?

90
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:48,630
I don't even begin to understand
the relevancy of that.

91
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:52,870
- It's my station.
- It's not your station! It's our station!

92
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:55,150
You should've learned
that one a long time ago.

93
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,270
You weren't there
to make policy.

94
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,710
You were there
to carry out policy.

95
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:03,710
Now we've had your history
of making up your own rules...

96
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:06,030
under review
for some time now.

97
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:10,750
We're reassigning you, Kendig.

98
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:13,390
You're going to sweat out
your time until pension...

99
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:16,510
running the filing section
right here.

100
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:20,470
Come on, Myerson. I'm a field man.
I've always been a field man.

101
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:24,310
The good news is I'm putting your
friend Joe Cutter in your place.

102
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,310
-Joe Cutter's a very good man.
- Yes, he is.

103
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:28,430
And he's 20 years
younger than you are.

104
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:32,070
Twenty-one. I don't know what's
buggin' you. You're overreacting.

105
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:35,710
I don't believe you're this upset
because ofthat Russian in Munich.

106
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:39,150
Damn it. I hate a man who doesn't
know when the party is over.

107
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:41,750
You will get that report
together, won't you?

108
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:44,510
And you can file it yourself
Monday morning.

109
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,790
Is this some kind ofa joke,
Myerson?

110
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,950
Come in, Cutter.

111
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:56,950
Congratulations, Joe.
You just got yourself a new job.

112
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:28,430
- How ya doin', Alex?
- Fine, Kendig.

113
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,470
Did you have the Redkskins
last Sunday?

114
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,990
- You bet I did.
- Good. I'm gonna look at the Kinberg file.

115
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:35,510
You know where it's at.

116
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:09,430
Okay, Alex.

117
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,470
Just stick with us this Sunday.

118
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,550
- We're gonna slaughter the Cowboys.
- I'm with you.

119
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:37,270
Mr. Myerson?
He's still not in his office.

120
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:39,590
He hasn't checked in
for two days, sir.

121
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:42,670
- Anything else?
- His apartment phone doesn't answer...

122
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:46,550
but, before he left, he put in
a call to Salzburg, Austria.

123
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,790
- Check it out.
- Yes, sir.

124
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,950
Excuse me.

125
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:17,350
I seeyou're looking
at the wine list.

126
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:21,510
-Yes, I am.
- May I perhaps suggest a wine?

127
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:23,350
That would be nice.

128
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:25,750
May I sit down, please?

129
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,790
Yes. Please do.

130
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:32,310
What wine do you
feel like drinking?

131
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:35,950
I'm not sure. I, uh...

132
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,950
Um, just a good wine.

133
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:41,710
What wine do you prefer?
Red wine? White? French? German?

134
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:46,070
I don't know. What's good
for this time ofthe day?

135
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:49,990
That would depend on what
you're thinking of eating.

136
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:55,070
Well, frankly, I... I, um...

137
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,990
hadn't quite made a decision
as to my meal.

138
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:01,550
- Is wine that important?
- Very important.

139
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:04,910
Do you prefer young wine
or one slightly older?

140
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,950
Oh, slightly... slightly older.

141
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:10,470
Mm. As a general rule,
the older wines are better.

142
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:14,030
It takes time forthe elements
in wine to resolve themselves...

143
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:16,070
into an harmonious whole.

144
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:18,710
It takes time and oxygen.

145
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:24,030
- Are you serious?
- Deadly serious.

146
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:26,430
Wine is not
a disembodied essence.

147
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:30,110
It is the product of skill,
knowledge and, in many cases, love.

148
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:35,630
Are you a...
a wine salesperson?

149
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,750
No. I am an ordinary person...

150
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:40,230
living quietly on
the generous endowment...

151
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:42,870
left me by my dear
departed husband.

152
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:44,870
- Oh, that's wonderful.
- Thank you.

153
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:47,990
- You certainly know a lot about wines.
- You're American.

154
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:51,270
- Yes.
- Americans hold many myths about wine.

155
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:54,670
You are all interested in fitness,
in general health.

156
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:57,670
You think wine is bad
for your liver and your heart.

157
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:01,350
This is completely not true.

158
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:05,030
It is the drinking of wine that makes
it possible to eat the rich food...

159
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,110
which is bad for your liver
and your heart...

160
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:09,790
because wine cuts grease.

161
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:13,070
A sip of wine leaves
your mouth completely clean...

162
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,190
and ready for the next bite...

163
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:18,310
of whatever it is you're eating.

164
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:28,310
Oh, where have you been,
you old goat?

165
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,790
You bastard. I thought
I'd never see you again.

166
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,750
Please watch your language.
You know how sensitive I am.

167
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:36,070
Come home with me.
I'll give you lunch.

168
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:38,110
This is a terrible place to eat.

169
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:48,150
Does he bite?

170
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:50,550
Only people he doesn't like.

171
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:53,070
Oh. I only bite people I like.

172
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,390
Hey, it's nice.

173
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:00,230
- How many hectares do you have?
- Two.

174
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,990
Nice.

175
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:13,030
Ah. Very nice indeed.

176
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:15,750
Thank you.
There's more.

177
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:25,190
- Hey, magnificent.
- Thank you.

178
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:27,190
Do you have help?

179
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:29,990
One small Austrian lady
three times a week.

180
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,670
And one large Austrian lady
four times a week.

181
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,270
- What's for lunch?
- What would you like?

182
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:37,310
You have any sausage?

183
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:42,830
Oh, yeah. I have bratwurst,
liverwurst, weisswurst.

184
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:45,550
How about some ham and eggs
and a beer?

185
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:47,590
Kitchen's downstairs.

186
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,750
Where do you keep
the beer, please?

187
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,950
Middle shelf.

188
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:59,550
- Miss the old life?
- No. Game got too dirty.

189
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:02,230
You still take
gin and ginger ale?

190
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:05,310
Mine was never
gin and ginger ale.

191
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:07,550
Montrachet '69, please.
Next to the beer.

192
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:10,670
Oh, of course.

193
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:15,150
When I first worked
for the agency...

194
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:17,390
its use seemed clear.

195
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:20,310
You knew where you stood.
The bad guys wore mustaches.

196
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:23,310
- Where's the opener?
- On the tray in front of you.

197
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:25,310
Now...

198
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:28,750
you need a scorecard to know
who the players are.

199
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,750
Even then, it's fuzzy.

200
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:34,110
- Where are the glasses?
- On the table in front of you.

201
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:36,390
I'm glad I'm out.

202
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,390
I'm out too.

203
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:40,510
What?

204
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:43,030
I quit, but they
don't know it yet.

205
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:45,230
I can't imagine you
without the agency.

206
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:47,230
It's your whole life.

207
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:49,910
They put Myerson
in charge of my section.

208
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:52,390
He wanted to retire me
behind a desk.

209
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:56,950
"See you next Tuesday" Myerson
in charge? They've gone mad.

210
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:59,430
He's got tapes on everybody
locked away.

211
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:01,430
They're scared to death ofhim.

212
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:04,470
- What are you going to do?
- I don't know. I'm working on it.

213
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,470
Did you come to Salzburg
to see me?

214
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:09,310
Mm! You and Mozart.

215
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:11,550
Do they still keep
tabs on me in Washington?

216
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,550
Well, we knew you married
some old Nazi.

217
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:16,150
- Come on, Kendig. Hewas Austrian.
- So was Hitler.

218
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:18,710
- Yes, but he had
no sense ofhumor.

219
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,710
Do I pass inspection?

220
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,750
Ah. You do.

221
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:25,390
You're so sweet and delicious.

222
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:28,790
- Mmm!
- What do you really want, hmm?

223
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,910
Somewhere to hide while you
decide what you're going to do.

224
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:33,830
Succor and solace
and a shoulder to cry on.

225
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:37,230
- Sounds pretty good to me. - How'd
you like to play gin rummythis evening?

226
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:40,430
- For how much?
- How much can you afford to lose?

227
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:04,110
That's the second four
you've given me.

228
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:09,630
Gin. Uh-huh, it's gin.

229
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:13,830
- Hmm. Thirty-three.
- Aha!

230
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:16,270
Blitzed and double blitzed.

231
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:18,510
What do you do with yourself
around here anyway?

232
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,550
Look after my late husband's
business interests.

233
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:23,550
- I keep myself occupied.
- Wanna tell me about him?

234
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:26,150
- No.
- Good.

235
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:29,150
Four... nine.

236
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:38,350
- You owe me...
- Shh, shh, shh.

237
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:47,430
You still owe me...

238
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:51,470
$135.62.

239
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:55,430
Wanna take it out in trade?

240
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:58,310
What do you have
that's worth that much?

241
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:03,270
Like antiques?

242
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,670
Come to bed.

243
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,710
I thought you'd never ask.

244
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:41,550
I hear you walked out
on your friends.

245
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,830
You hear, or is this
a trial balloon?

246
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:47,150
Did they force you out
because you did not arrest me?

247
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:50,550
- Right.
- I feel a bit guilty about that.

248
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:53,030
- I'd like to make amends.
- How?

249
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:55,710
I'm offering to put you
right back into the game.

250
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:59,670
Yaskov, Yaskov.
I'd make a useless double agent.

251
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:01,670
Of course you would.

252
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:04,910
Double agents must be
drab little people. Colorless.

253
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:07,270
No, that would never
do for you.

254
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:10,830
Listen, I want
to run you in the field...

255
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:12,870
as my own agent.

256
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:19,510
We'd make it worth
your while, of course.

257
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:21,550
There is plenty of money.

258
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:31,390
No.

259
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:36,270
Money is too expensive
to be earned that way, Yaskov.

260
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:42,230
Look. The human species
has been on this planet...

261
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:45,990
for, um, millions of years.

262
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:48,710
Except for the tiniest
fraction of the time...

263
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:51,030
we all lived as hunters.

264
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:55,390
Hunting... it's the only
natural way of life.

265
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:59,190
It was your way of life
until you walked away from it.

266
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:01,590
I'm offering to return it to you.

267
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:05,270
- By the way, we are being photographed.
- Yours or mine?

268
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:09,670
Yours.
I recognize the mustache.

269
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:11,670
Oh, that's Follett.
He's an idiot.

270
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,910
Probably no film
in the camera.

271
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,590
Could you be
rejecting my offer...

272
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,910
out of some absurd
loyalty to the flag?

273
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:27,230
You may as well give up,
tovarich. Nyet interested.

274
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:31,670
A pity. What do you intend to do
with the rest of your life, then?

275
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,790
Write your memoirs?

276
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:37,630
Memoirs?

277
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:39,870
That's not a bad idea.

278
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:45,870
- Have you got a typewriter?
- In the den.

279
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:48,070
What are you going to do,
write some letters?

280
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:51,030
- No. I'm going to write mymemoirs.
- Oh, that's nice.

281
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:53,110
Your childhood in the ghetto?

282
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:55,150
My last 30 years
in the ghetto.

283
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:57,870
Uh-huh. You're going to relate
some amusing incidents.

284
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:02,510
And some not so amusing.
Would you put on a record, please?

285
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:05,470
- What are you going to write about?
- I'm going to tell the truth.

286
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,830
Oh, it's a work of fiction.

287
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:12,470
Ah. You didn't say that.
You didn't make that clear.

288
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:43,990
Oh!

289
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:47,230
What? What's the matter?

290
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:56,110
You're insane. They will
obliterate you in five minutes.

291
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:58,150
- It'll shake 'em up.
- Shake them up?

292
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:00,150
They will send men
who will come and kill you.

293
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,550
I'll keep one step
ahead of them. That's enough.

294
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:05,030
Well, almost enough.
I need your help.

295
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,430
Oh, no. No.
I'm very sorry. No.

296
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:11,910
I have a nice life, a beautiful house,
money, the respect ofthe community.

297
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:14,390
Don't look at me
like that. No!

298
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:21,390
What do you
want me to do?

299
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:26,430
Find me a copying machine, get me a
stack of 9x12 manila mailing envelopes.

300
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:30,310
We are both mad.
Mad! Gone!

301
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:41,350
I thought perhaps you could
shed some light on this.

302
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:43,790
I know Kendig's a friend
of yours, Cutter, but...

303
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:47,150
what the fuck is he doing
drinking vodka with Yaskov?

304
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:49,190
Yaskov is the enemy, isn't he?

305
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:55,030
I don't think this is
anything to worry about.

306
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:57,230
They've known each other
for years.

307
00:24:57,310 --> 00:25:02,150
He and Yaskov used to exchange
people at Checkpoint Charlie.

308
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:04,150
There's nothing sinister about it.

309
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:08,510
In Munich, he turned him loose. And
now he's having a drink with him?

310
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,950
Better have a look at this.

311
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:13,030
"Kendig, M."

312
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:19,150
Nothing sinister, huh?

313
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:21,230
Why has he tampered
with his file?

314
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:25,790
I don't think
this means a thing.

315
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:28,510
Probably shouldn't have done it,
but it's typical of him.

316
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:31,030
He doesn't want to be a number
in anybody's computer.

317
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:33,750
Bullshit.
He's up to something.

318
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:35,830
It's your job
to find out what it is.

319
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:04,310
You like opera?

320
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:07,230
- Yeah. You?
-Ja.

321
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:09,870
- Was ist das?
- "Barber of Seville." Figaro.

322
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:13,310
- Oh. By Mozart.
- No. That's the other Figaro.

323
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:15,510
- Huh?
- That's the...

324
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:17,870
- Figaro.
- Ah.

325
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,910
- AufWiedersehen.
- AufWiedersehen.

326
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:43,950
Paris.

327
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:47,430
Peking.

328
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:51,630
Moscow.

329
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,910
Rome.

330
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:00,830
London.

331
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:05,310
Und Washington, D. C.

332
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,870
He must be out
of his freaking mind.

333
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:11,270
"Subjects to be covered in
future chapters will be...

334
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:15,590
"How much did the department of dirty
tricks have to do with the plane crash...

335
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:18,710
"which killed
Secretary Hammarskjold?

336
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:24,270
C. I. A. future plans for
clandestine operations."

337
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:30,150
My God! He sent copies to Moscow,
Peking, London, Paris, Bonn, and Rome.

338
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:34,310
Do you know he can blow every
operation we've set up for two years.

339
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:37,630
He can make some waves
ifhe goes through with it.

340
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:39,790
I don't think it's funny, Joe.

341
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:41,710
Of course it's funny, Leonard.

342
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:45,070
He's out ofhis fucking mind.
Where is he?

343
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:47,750
Well, that was mailed
from Salzburg.

344
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,750
But Follett says that a guy
that looked like him...

345
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:53,510
crossed over into Switzerland a couple of
days ago singing the "Barber of Seville."

346
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:56,630
Sounds like Kendig
hoping we'll chase him.

347
00:27:56,710 --> 00:28:00,910
Well, let's tell Follett to quit playing
around and find the son of a bitch.

348
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:21,030
Sit down.

349
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:43,430
Voila.

350
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:46,870
Three passports... blank.

351
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:49,030
Three driving licenses... blank.

352
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:51,110
And a credit card.

353
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:57,070
"James Butler."

354
00:28:57,150 --> 00:29:00,710
There is no such a thing as a
blank credit card. You know that.

355
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:04,670
These look okay. Everything except
the price you quoted on the telephone.

356
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:07,670
Five thousand francs
for the passports.

357
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:12,030
Two thousand for the licenses. And
forthe credit cards, five hundred.

358
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:14,870
They are not hot.
The numbers have been changed.

359
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:16,870
My department's on a budget.

360
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:19,790
Mais, oui. So am I.

361
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:23,190
How many years have I been
working for your agency, huh?

362
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:25,190
Am I not always reliable?

363
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:28,470
Don't I deserve
any consideration?

364
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:31,510
Six thousand for the package.
That's it.

365
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:34,710
Impossible.

366
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:37,550
Impossible.

367
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:40,390
Tell you what.
I'll give you 7,000.

368
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:42,390
Leave me with 500, will ya?

369
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:46,190
- For what?
- For what?

370
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:48,550
Cherchezla femme.

371
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:51,070
Uh... a sandwich or something?

372
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:53,750
I don't think he'll publish it.

373
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:56,630
He's sending copies to the
intelligence people, not the publishers.

374
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:59,150
It's his fucking suicide note.
The bastard wants...

375
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:02,590
to go down in flames, and he wants
us to put him out of his misery.

376
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:04,590
He's not the suicidal type.

377
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:07,430
You put him on the bench. He's
putting himself back in the game.

378
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:10,870
- That's what it's all about.
- The game is over.

379
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:15,790
Listen, this is just a teaser.
This is just one chapter.

380
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:17,870
Suppose we don't take the bait.

381
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:20,950
If we don't play,
he'll probably have to quit.

382
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:23,550
It's no fun playing byyourself.

383
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:25,990
I've got a meeting
of the Security Council.

384
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:28,270
Walk me out.

385
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:30,270
I don't think you understand.

386
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:32,310
On this play,
we have got to take him out.

387
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:34,910
Because if we don't,
they will.

388
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:36,990
The Soviets will read that teaser...

389
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:40,150
and realize how much information
he's got in his pointed little head.

390
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:42,710
They'll drop everything in a rush
to grab him alive and squeeze him.

391
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:45,310
We can't afford that, can we?

392
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:47,630
I want you on this full-time
as of right now.

393
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:50,630
Anything you need, you ask for.
Top priority.

394
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:52,630
I want you to cancel his ticket.

395
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:55,310
We don't have to do that.
Let me try and stop him.

396
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:57,390
You're on overtime, Cutter.

397
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,590
Chemin de fer.

398
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:03,070
The bank closes this time
six to seven.

399
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:05,230
And the shoe passes
to a new bank.

400
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:10,150
Thank you.
Place your bets. Thank you.

401
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:12,270
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you, sir.

402
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,670
- Sir, good night.
- Goodnight.

403
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,750
Would you like smoking
or nonsmoking?

404
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:21,190
Oh, nonsmoking, please, but make it an
aisle seat. I go to the bathroom a lot.

405
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:23,230
Okay. Fine.

406
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:26,270
Have you traveled Concorde before?

407
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:28,590
No, not to the best
of my recollection.

408
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:30,950
I understand you get there
before you leave.

409
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:32,950
Yes, that's right.
There you are, sir.

410
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:35,510
- Thank you very much. Have a
pleasant flight. - Thank you.

411
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:46,950
Okay. We know he's traveling
under the name of James Butler.

412
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:49,030
For the time being.

413
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:51,110
We know he left
the Grand Hotel in Marseilles...

414
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:53,430
tookan Air France
to Heathrow.

415
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:56,990
We know hewon f10,000
at the Grovener Casino...

416
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:59,270
and we're assuming
that he's still in London.

417
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:02,310
- You got a nail file? - I'd like to
have a look at his travel vouchers...

418
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:04,310
for the last year or two.

419
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:06,590
Might be something in there,
some pattern of movement.

420
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:09,070
You won't find anything
consistent on him.

421
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:12,910
His checks keep bouncing
'cause his signature varies.

422
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:14,910
He's a class act.

423
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:17,630
You like the guy, don't you?

424
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:20,030
Yes, I like him.

425
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:24,910
Let's get something to eat.

426
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:32,470
I'll get it.

427
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:37,990
762.

428
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:40,390
No. This is Leonard Ross.
Who's calling?

429
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:50,870
Start a trace.

430
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:55,150
Kendig,
what a pleasant surprise.

431
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:59,390
-Joe Cutter. Well, I'm glad they put
in the first team. - Thank you.

432
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:02,230
I mailed out another
chapter this morning.

433
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:05,430
If you're collecting stamps,
it's postmarked London.

434
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:07,430
What are you trying to prove?

435
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:11,750
I'm not trying to prove anything,
Joe. I'm just trying to have some fun.

436
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:13,790
Suppose you let me
talk you out of this...

437
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:17,710
before you find yourself at the
bottom of some river sipping sewage.

438
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:20,710
I'll be mailing it out
one chapter at a time.

439
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,710
Be more interesting that way.

440
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,910
You can tell Myerson that I'm
saving the juicy stuff for the end.

441
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:29,830
Listen, Kendig, I'm the one who's
gonna have to do the dirty work.

442
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:31,990
I don't want that.

443
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:35,270
Think of me, can't you? Don't you
have any feelings for me at all?

444
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:37,590
I'm gonna be tortured by this
for the rest ofmy life.

445
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:39,870
All my money will go
to a psychiatrist.

446
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:43,430
That's very good, Joe. Very dramatic.
I've never heard that used before.

447
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:48,150
Well, I think you've had time
to locate this call by now, kid.

448
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:51,150
So I'll be saying so long.
I'll see you around some time.

449
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:53,710
Kendig.
Kendig, are you there?

450
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:01,150
Did you get a line on that?

451
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:03,230
Are you sure?

452
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:05,510
That son of a bitch.

453
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:08,030
He's right here in Washington.
It's a local call.

454
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:23,030
- Anything?
- Nothing.

455
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:26,190
- He's probably halfway to the moon by now.
- Don't sound so pleased.

456
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:31,870
I've got everyone who knows him
by sight working the streets.

457
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:34,590
- Good work, Leonard.
- What would you suggest...

458
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:37,070
we just go back and wait
for the phone to ring again?

459
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:39,550
I don't think he's gonna call
again. He said what he has to say.

460
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:41,550
Excuse me, sir.

461
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:43,590
We found this under "B"
in the phone book.

462
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:51,510
I think we can say
good-bye to James Butler.

463
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:04,750
- Is everything okay?
-Yeah, thanks.

464
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:07,110
- More coffee?
- No, thank you.

465
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:18,230
Hello, Operator.

466
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:21,990
I'd like to make a "bill to" call
to overseas, please.

467
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:39,110
- Hello?
- Hi, Is.

468
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:42,230
Right on time. How are you?
Did you have a safe trip?

469
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:44,590
Yes. I said hello
to the folks.

470
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:47,230
They were surprised
to hear from me.

471
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:49,230
Have any of them
paid you a visit?

472
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:53,750
Only friend Follett.
He's watching me right now.

473
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:57,070
Give him a kiss for me
and tell him I'll write.

474
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:59,950
I'm sure he'd be very interested
to hear from you.

475
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:02,030
Now, you remember...

476
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:04,070
when and where
I'm gonna call you next.

477
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:07,710
Of course I remember.
And you remember to be careful.

478
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:09,710
And if you should happen
to see Kendig...

479
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:12,670
tell the horny old goat
I miss him very much and love him.

480
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:17,390
- Good-bye, Mr... - Hannaway.
Charlie Hannaway.

481
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:19,830
And I love you very much too.

482
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:33,790
Excuse me.
Mrs. Schonenberg?

483
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:35,990
- Yes?
- May I see you for a moment?

484
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:38,670
- It's about Miles Kendig.
- I thought it might be.

485
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:43,910
Not exactly friendly, is he?

486
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:45,950
Oh, he likes the people I like.

487
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:49,590
I see. You haven't by any chance
just been talking to him?

488
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:51,830
- Regretfully, no.
- That's too bad.

489
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:53,830
You see, it's important
that we reach him fast.

490
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:56,270
It's about his family.
There's been an accident.

491
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:59,150
Oh, how dreadful.
Not a tragic accident, I hope.

492
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:02,630
I'm afraid so.
His mother.

493
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:06,110
- That's more ofa miracle than a tragedy.
- What?

494
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:09,030
His mother died 25 years ago.

495
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:11,670
August 13th.
I believe itwas a Friday.

496
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:14,470
All right, Mrs. Schonenberg,
where is he?

497
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:17,510
My name is von Schonenberg.

498
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:20,510
I am an Austrian citizen
with a valid passport.

499
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:23,870
You have no right to question
or detain me without authority.

500
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:27,830
My dog is very highly strung
and has been known to attack.

501
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:29,910
I suggest you leave me alone.

502
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:32,750
Don't be too clever,
Mrs. von Schonenberg.

503
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:34,790
We're going to stop him.

504
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:39,150
Won't you have
to find him first?

505
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:41,670
Oh, do stop
following me around.

506
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:45,070
You're making my dog
very nervous.

507
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:48,030
He detests the smell of stupidity.

508
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:24,990
You know me. I cross every "T"
and dot every "I."

509
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:27,190
Is it someone
who was recommended to you?

510
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:29,590
Well, no, but I'm sure
it's quite all right.

511
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:32,150
He's putting down
a rather large cash deposit...

512
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:34,870
and he looks very reliable.

513
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:36,710
Well, I'm trusting your judgment.

514
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:40,310
Well, thank you, Mrs. Myerson.
I'm sure it'll be all right.

515
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:42,630
Lovely woman.
Very particular.

516
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:44,630
You're not a Democrat, are you?

517
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:47,430
- No, ma'am. Oh.
- Can you hear me?

518
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:49,750
Yes, Mrs. Myerson,
and I'm sure Mr. Hannaway...

519
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:52,910
is going to enjoy
your gracious home.

520
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:54,910
Now you just take care
of yourself, honey.

521
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:56,910
I will.

522
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:58,950
Well, that's settled.

523
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:02,150
Now all you have to do
is sign the papers...

524
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:04,630
and pay over
that nasty old money.

525
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,630
It's pretty hot out there,
isn't it?

526
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:10,350
Yes. It is 15 degrees warmer
than usual for this time ofyear.

527
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:12,350
- Is that a fact?
- Yes.

528
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:14,670
Now here's the inventory.

529
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:17,390
Now you must promise to be extra
careful with the Myerson's effects.

530
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:19,430
Oh, I will.
I certainly will, ma'am.

531
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:21,990
- Where do I sign?
- Right here.

532
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:28,910
Ah, such peace and quiet.

533
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:31,710
They say it is the coolest spot
on the island.

534
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:36,670
Should be a wonderful place
to rest up after your operation.

535
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,870
- What did you say it was for?
- Prostate.

536
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:41,150
Oh, of course.
Well, you know, Mr. Hannaway...

537
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:43,190
my husband had it done
two years ago.

538
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:45,190
- Is that right?
- Yes.

539
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:48,670
And I wanna tell you,
it didn't make any difference.

540
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:51,590
- I mean, we went on a second honeymoon.
- Oh, that's nice.

541
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:54,670
And, Mr. Hannaway, honey, you
take care of yourself, you hear?

542
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:56,990
Yes, ma'am.

543
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:04,430
Ooh.

544
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:22,390
Chapter two, huh?

545
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:24,550
It's embarrassing.

546
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:29,510
"Whose bright idea was it to send
the box of poison cigars to Castro?"

547
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:32,310
Is he still sending copies
to Yaskov and everybody?

548
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:36,270
Everybody.
Why can'twe find him?

549
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:38,710
Well, I told you
it wasn't going to be easy.

550
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:42,470
"Ridiculous attempt to
assassinate Papa Doc Duvalier...

551
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:44,470
by bombing
the presidential palace."

552
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:46,830
Son of a bitch.
It's a personal vendetta against me.

553
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:48,830
Well, if the shoe fits.

554
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:50,990
Do you know
which side you're on?

555
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:52,950
I'm working here, aren't I?

556
00:41:52,951 --> 00:41:55,390
And I was trained by one of the
best men in the business.

557
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:59,150
We've got leads.

558
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:03,190
We know he got
rid of that car in Virginia.

559
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:06,870
A guy answering his description picked
up an old clunker in South Carolina.

560
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:11,350
We got the license plate numbers.
One thing leads to another.

561
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:13,510
We'll get him.

562
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:32,630
Morning, Mr. Myerson,
you short person.

563
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:34,630
I'll tell you something, Myerson.

564
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:37,190
The more I dig into this,
the more disgusting it gets.

565
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:45,110
Be nice to think that you had a
few second thoughts now and then...

566
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:47,110
but there's no chance
of that, is there?

567
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:51,670
You probably see yourself
as an innocent bystander betrayed.

568
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:03,630
As I look at this thing now,
I can't believe I was ever part ofit.

569
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:07,310
Tell you something, I wouldn't go
back now for any amount of money.

570
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:24,990
Sorry, sir. Mr. Maddox
says he's busy just now.

571
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:27,350
- Okay. Would you get me another beer,
please? - Sure enough.

572
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:29,670
- Are you finished?
- Yeah.

573
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:39,990
Hi, there.

574
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:42,950
- Is Leroy Maddox in?
- Yes. May I help you?

575
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:46,310
- I know the way. That's all right.
- You can't go in there, sir.

576
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:48,710
Honey, what's your name?

577
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:50,830
- My name is Sarah.
- Sarah.

578
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:53,350
- You new here, are you?
- Yes, I am.

579
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:55,790
- Well, I know Mr. Maddox a long time.
- You can't go in there.

580
00:43:55,870 --> 00:43:57,870
You can't go in there, sir.

581
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:03,470
- May I help you, friend?
- Name is Jim Murdison out of Dallas.

582
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:06,630
Expect you don't remember me,
but I was up here a littlewhile back...

583
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:09,150
with ol'Jim-Bob
Fredericks of Houston.

584
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:13,310
Ah, Mr. Murdison.
Any friend of ol'Jim-Bob's.

585
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:15,670
Sit yourself down.
Tell me what I can do for you.

586
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:18,870
Well, ol'Jim-Bob said ifl ever
needed a little special help...

587
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:20,950
I should look you up.

588
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:24,310
I'd be mighty pleased to help you.
What kind of thing you have in mind?

589
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:27,110
Oh, you can drop the accent.
It's terrible.

590
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:30,070
Okay. I'd like
to charter a seaplane.

591
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:34,510
Well, now I'm not exactly
in the airplane business.

592
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:39,910
How soon would you
be needin' it?

593
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:41,950
A week from Friday.

594
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:46,950
Um, can I have
my clip back, please?

595
00:44:47,030 --> 00:44:48,990
Sure.

596
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:52,310
I do happen to know
a charter pilot...

597
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:54,870
who is, uh... discreet.

598
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:56,870
I tell you what, Mr. Murdison...

599
00:44:56,950 --> 00:45:00,350
you give me a call back
on Tuesday night. Okay?

600
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:04,870
Okay. And by the way,
my name is not Murdison.

601
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:07,990
Well, I didn't think it was,
Mr. Murdison.

602
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:34,150
- Howy'all doin' there?
- Pretty good.

603
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:36,550
- You have any trouble?
- No, sir.

604
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:39,510
Works just like you drew it.

605
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:42,270
Balances real good
even when she's full.

606
00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:44,270
What'd you say you was
gonna use it for?

607
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:46,910
Oh, we just got some
driveways we're workin' on.

608
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:49,630
Driveways?

609
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:51,630
Yeah. You know, driveways.

610
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:54,070
Oh. Driveways.

611
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:57,990
Well, that's a...
That's a real good idea.

612
00:45:58,070 --> 00:46:00,710
I sure hope it does
the trick for you, Mr. Hannaway.

613
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:02,790
$450.

614
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:06,070
- Thank you very much, sir. Thank you
very much indeed. - Thank you.

615
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:20,350
- Good-bye, sir.
- G'-bye.

616
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:23,030
G'-bye?

617
00:46:23,110 --> 00:46:27,150
* Count on me, love me *

618
00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:31,030
*Take me
Touch me *

619
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:37,790
*Yeah *

620
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:50,750
* Come back to bed
You been away too long *

621
00:46:50,830 --> 00:46:54,510
* I need to hold you tight*

622
00:46:54,590 --> 00:46:58,230
*And close my heart
until you lay beside me*

623
00:46:58,310 --> 00:47:02,790
*Open all my senses
through the night**

624
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:04,830
- Areyou Murdison?
- Yeah.

625
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:07,590
I'm Carla Fleming. I fly a seaplane.
I understand you're looking for one.

626
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:09,630
Shall we sit down?

627
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:16,950
When and where
do you wanna fly?

628
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:19,590
This Friday.
A young lady and I...

629
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,990
- Or is it "a young lady and me"?
- "I."

630
00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:25,750
- Uh, do you know where
Coffee Bluffis? - Uh-huh.

631
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:29,390
Okay, you pick us up there
and you fly us to Martinique.

632
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:31,670
Has your plane got
the range for it?

633
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:33,670
Mm-hmm.
It's a Lake Buccaneer.

634
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:36,270
It's not gonna be cheap, since
I don't know what we're carrying.

635
00:47:36,350 --> 00:47:39,430
Well, I told you... a young lady.
I'm not smuggling.

636
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:41,630
I hear you saying it.
I don't wanna know eitherway.

637
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:43,710
$3,000.

638
00:47:49,310 --> 00:47:51,710
I just wanna charter it.
I don't wanna buy it.

639
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:54,190
I'm sure you could get a better
price from one of the airlines.

640
00:47:54,270 --> 00:47:56,510
I think the regular fare
is about $150.

641
00:47:56,550 --> 00:47:59,150
Okay, okay. I'll give you the
money right before we take off.

642
00:47:59,230 --> 00:48:03,350
Just as soon as possible
after dawn this Friday.

643
00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:05,470
- You got it?
- I'll be there.

644
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:07,550
- Okay.
- Now you can buy me a scotch and soda.

645
00:48:09,950 --> 00:48:11,950
Scotch and soda
forthe lady.

646
00:49:20,910 --> 00:49:22,910
Pay attention, shorty.

647
00:49:22,990 --> 00:49:27,790
I'd like to make a call
to Salzburg, Austria, please.

648
00:49:32,430 --> 00:49:34,790
- Hello.
- Hello, Is.

649
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:37,630
Kendig? What the hell
are you doing?

650
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:39,790
Don't you know
this damn phone is tapped?

651
00:49:39,870 --> 00:49:41,950
Watch the profanity, please.

652
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:43,990
I've been missing you,
thinking about you...

653
00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:46,310
and I had this sudden urge.

654
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:48,310
- Are you drunk?
- It's Kendig!

655
00:49:48,390 --> 00:49:51,150
There are 212 tape recorders
on this line.

656
00:49:51,230 --> 00:49:53,670
It'll take 94 seconds
for them to trace the call.

657
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:04,270
Is Follett
still harassing you?

658
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:07,110
It's "harassing," dear.
Harassing.

659
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:09,190
He's trying,
but he's afraid of the dog.

660
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:11,190
I haven't seen him
for a few days.

661
00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:13,750
He must be off somewhere
with his nose to the ground.

662
00:50:13,790 --> 00:50:17,070
- Who, the dog?
- No, dear. Follett.

663
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:20,430
Are you keeping this line open
until he can pinpoint you?

664
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:25,070
Follett couldn't pinpoint his
own backside in broad daylight.

665
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:28,430
- We'll see about that.
Hurry it up.

666
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:30,430
You do know what
you're doing, don't you?

667
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:33,030
Certainly not.

668
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:35,030
How's the book coming?
Is it finished?

669
00:50:35,110 --> 00:50:39,310
All but the last chapter. You know,
that's the stuff with the dynamite in it.

670
00:50:39,390 --> 00:50:42,910
I'm just at the bit about Follett when
he got caught with his pants down...

671
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:45,870
writing obscenities
on the men's room wall.

672
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:47,870
Was he alone?

673
00:50:47,950 --> 00:50:50,390
Very funny. Very funny.

674
00:50:50,430 --> 00:50:52,950
The state ofGeorgia, sir.
They'reworking on the exchange.

675
00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:54,950
Geez. Tell them to hurry it up.

676
00:50:55,030 --> 00:50:58,030
Not to be gruesome, old darling,
but I hope you've written your will.

677
00:50:58,110 --> 00:51:01,830
Yes. I've left everything
to the Flat Earth Society.

678
00:51:01,870 --> 00:51:03,830
But don't worry about it.

679
00:51:03,870 --> 00:51:06,830
I'm forted up here
with plenty of firepower.

680
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:09,510
No, sir. They'll never
take me alive.

681
00:51:09,590 --> 00:51:11,310
I'm armed to the teeth.

682
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:13,830
- Good grief!.
Haven't you got it yet?

683
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:15,830
Any second now, sir.

684
00:51:15,910 --> 00:51:19,990
- I'll call you again. You know
the time and place. - I do.

685
00:51:20,070 --> 00:51:22,310
- Geez!
- Bye, darling.

686
00:51:22,390 --> 00:51:24,550
Bye, darling.

687
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:36,710
Telephone number
area code... 311-555-1285.

688
00:51:36,790 --> 00:51:38,830
Maple Road,
Adairsville, Georgia.

689
00:51:38,910 --> 00:51:40,830
- Get the agency.
- Yes, sir.

690
00:51:43,110 --> 00:51:45,910
What? Repeat that.

691
00:51:47,150 --> 00:51:49,590
I don't fucking believe it!

692
00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:51,590
Excuse me, Beverly.

693
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:53,590
Mr. Kendig has
rented out my house.

694
00:51:53,670 --> 00:51:56,590
Would you get Mr. Cutter
in here right away, please?

695
00:51:56,630 --> 00:52:00,590
He's actually had the balls
to hide out in my house!

696
00:52:29,790 --> 00:52:32,030
It's a house on the edge ofa marsh
about five minutes from here.

697
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:34,150
I know where it is.
Is it covered?

698
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:36,230
We got a couple boys across the
road. We didn't want to alert him.

699
00:52:36,310 --> 00:52:38,230
Alert him?
He knows we're coming.

700
00:52:38,310 --> 00:52:40,750
Just one thing, Mr. Myerson.

701
00:52:40,830 --> 00:52:43,270
This is our jurisdiction,
not yours.

702
00:52:43,310 --> 00:52:45,270
It's an F. B. I. case now.
I run the show.

703
00:52:45,310 --> 00:52:48,190
I want one ofmy men
in each of these cars.

704
00:53:31,870 --> 00:53:35,430
Jerry, you take the back
and the far side.

705
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:37,550
Bobby, you take this side.

706
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:40,470
I'll take the front.

707
00:54:02,950 --> 00:54:05,430
Bring me the bullhorn
and the gas.

708
00:54:23,710 --> 00:54:26,550
Kendig.
This is the F. B. I.

709
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:28,110
We've got you surrounded.

710
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:31,710
Throw out your guns and come out
with your hands over your head.

711
00:54:31,790 --> 00:54:34,230
You've got 60 seconds
before we use tear gas.

712
00:54:36,950 --> 00:54:38,910
I hope your guys
aren't trigger-happy.

713
00:54:38,990 --> 00:54:41,710
It'd be a shame
to damage this house.

714
00:54:41,790 --> 00:54:44,590
We don't shoot first, but
if he tries to blast his way out...

715
00:54:44,630 --> 00:54:48,150
- With what? He hasn't carried a gun for
years. - That's not what I was told.

716
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:51,430
"Forted up with plenty of firepower.
Armed to the teeth."

717
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:53,990
What secrets did he steal?

718
00:54:54,070 --> 00:54:56,870
It's on a need-to-know basis...
a matter of national security.

719
00:54:56,950 --> 00:54:59,430
Yeah.

720
00:54:59,510 --> 00:55:02,150
That's a phrase that's lost
a good deal of meaning lately.

721
00:55:06,910 --> 00:55:08,870
You got 20 seconds, Kendig.

722
00:55:25,470 --> 00:55:27,470
Give him the gas.

723
00:55:38,110 --> 00:55:41,590
Do that one more time, Kendig,
and we'll blow you to pieces.

724
00:55:43,870 --> 00:55:45,510
Let him have it.

725
00:55:57,230 --> 00:56:00,790
Freeze!
Keep your hands down.

726
00:56:00,870 --> 00:56:05,390
Nice shootin', Ross. Eight thousand
panes, and you hit one of them.

727
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:10,830
- What's happening?
- They're shooting up your house.

728
00:56:18,790 --> 00:56:21,350
Stop it! Stop it!

729
00:56:21,390 --> 00:56:23,350
Cease fire!

730
00:56:23,390 --> 00:56:26,870
Fucking Idiots!

731
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:29,270
Stop it! Stop it!

732
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:32,070
Get down, you idiot!
You wanna get yourself killed?

733
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:35,470
This is a mistake!

734
00:56:35,550 --> 00:56:37,470
- In you go, Ross.
- Am I driving?

735
00:56:37,550 --> 00:56:39,590
Move over to the other side.
Move it.

736
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:44,150
That's enough!
That's enough!

737
00:56:44,230 --> 00:56:47,190
- You're destroying my house!
- Give it one more.

738
00:56:49,230 --> 00:56:51,230
Okay, boys. Cease fire.

739
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:55,630
Soon as the smoke clears,
we'll go in and take a look.

740
00:56:58,630 --> 00:57:01,110
I don't believe this.

741
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:03,190
I don't fucking believe this.

742
00:57:03,270 --> 00:57:05,630
- Talk about playing into this hands.
-Just shut the fuck up!

743
00:57:05,670 --> 00:57:07,630
There's a guy pulling
out of here in a pickup...

744
00:57:07,670 --> 00:57:09,630
with one ofthe C. I. A. men.

745
00:57:09,670 --> 00:57:11,670
Ross!

746
00:57:17,950 --> 00:57:20,990
- That's him!
- Back to the cars.

747
00:57:23,670 --> 00:57:26,350
- I'll call the fire department.
- Son of a bitch!

748
00:57:29,470 --> 00:57:31,390
Mike, stay here.

749
00:57:31,470 --> 00:57:33,950
Let's go!

750
00:58:15,710 --> 00:58:18,630
Now I know what
F. B. I. stands for.

751
00:58:18,710 --> 00:58:21,110
Fucking Ball-busting
Imbeciles.

752
00:58:26,190 --> 00:58:29,150
Okay, Ross.
This is where you get off.

753
00:58:29,230 --> 00:58:31,990
You used to be a pretty
good man. I looked up to you.

754
00:58:32,070 --> 00:58:34,150
- What happened?
- Get out.

755
00:58:34,230 --> 00:58:37,870
- I came to my senses, that's all.
- How do you figure that?

756
00:58:37,950 --> 00:58:41,150
A few skunks in the agency
that needed flushing out.

757
00:58:41,230 --> 00:58:43,190
Close the door.
Back off.

758
00:58:46,110 --> 00:58:49,390
You're just making a fool of yourself,
Kendig. You don't have a chance.

759
00:58:49,470 --> 00:58:51,630
Oh, yeah?

760
00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:54,870
Don't bet on that, Ross.
So long, kid.

761
00:59:43,990 --> 00:59:46,670
- Mornin'.
- Good mornin'.

762
01:00:01,950 --> 01:00:04,870
- Hiya, kid.
- Hi.

763
01:00:05,870 --> 01:00:07,790
- You alone?
- Yeah.

764
01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:10,950
- Where's your lady friend?
- Her mother wouldn't let her come.

765
01:00:11,030 --> 01:00:13,030
Okay. Let's get going.

766
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:24,270
One passenger or two...
the price is still the same.

767
01:00:24,350 --> 01:00:27,030
Oh, that's a relief.

768
01:00:27,070 --> 01:00:29,990
Three thousand bucks.
There we go.

769
01:00:30,070 --> 01:00:32,590
Thank you.
Next stop... Martinique.

770
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:34,590
How about a change of course?

771
01:00:34,670 --> 01:00:37,110
092 magnetic.

772
01:00:37,190 --> 01:00:39,190
- Bermuda?
- Why not?

773
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:42,150
Okay by me. That'll take
about seven hours.

774
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:44,550
We haven't got a bathroom.
Can you make it?

775
01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:47,990
- I'll be very careful.
- What did you do, rob a bank?

776
01:00:48,070 --> 01:00:50,630
- Is that what's in the suitcase?
- Uh, yes.

777
01:00:50,710 --> 01:00:55,230
Gee, I never drove a get away
car before. It's kind offun.

778
01:00:55,310 --> 01:00:58,470
- You mind ifl steer a while?
- You know how?

779
01:00:58,550 --> 01:01:01,710
Yeah. They trained me as
a ferry pilot for M. A. T. S.

780
01:01:01,790 --> 01:01:05,470
- Still got my license.
- Sure. Who's "they"?

781
01:01:05,550 --> 01:01:08,110
Guys with little
plastic I. D. cards.

782
01:01:08,190 --> 01:01:10,510
They'll probably come around,
ask you a lot of questions.

783
01:01:10,550 --> 01:01:12,510
Just tell them the truth.

784
01:01:12,550 --> 01:01:14,870
I generally tell the truth.
It's easier that way.

785
01:01:27,870 --> 01:01:29,830
- Are you going back tonight?
- Oh, noway.

786
01:01:29,870 --> 01:01:32,270
I'm gonna get my hair done
and get a good night's sleep.

787
01:01:32,350 --> 01:01:35,630
- Well, you certainly got enough
money for it. -Just about.

788
01:01:35,670 --> 01:01:38,070
So long. Take care of yourself,
whatever you're doing.

789
01:01:38,110 --> 01:01:41,190
You seem like a nice fella.
You remind me of my father.

790
01:01:41,270 --> 01:01:43,670
That's always been my problem.

791
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:28,910
Here's your tea, dear. Nice and hot,
with lemon. Just the way you like it.

792
01:02:28,990 --> 01:02:30,910
I don't like lemon.
I like milk.

793
01:02:30,990 --> 01:02:34,190
Now, is there anything else
that I can get for you boys?

794
01:02:34,230 --> 01:02:37,230
Well, don't work Mr. Cutter too
hard. After all, it is Sunday.

795
01:02:37,270 --> 01:02:41,110
I'm sure he needs his rest. If you
need me, I'll be in the sewing room.

796
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:44,470
Should have terminated her
20 years ago.

797
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:49,910
Joe, maybewe've been going
about this the wrong way.

798
01:02:49,950 --> 01:02:51,950
Perhaps it needs
a lighter touch.

799
01:02:52,030 --> 01:02:55,510
You know, sometimes bullying
people doesn'twork.

800
01:02:55,590 --> 01:02:57,950
Let's be sophisticated here.

801
01:02:57,990 --> 01:03:01,870
Maybe we can use a carrot
instead of a stick.

802
01:03:02,990 --> 01:03:05,110
Kendig likes girls,
doesn't he?

803
01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:07,230
Listen, Myerson,
let me make a suggestion.

804
01:03:07,310 --> 01:03:10,750
Why don't I go over to Salzburg
and have a little talk with Isobel?

805
01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:13,910
We worked together once. Maybe
she'll listen to what I have to say.

806
01:03:15,190 --> 01:03:19,150
Have you got something
going on with Isobel too?

807
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:22,310
We're always
one step behind him.

808
01:03:22,390 --> 01:03:25,630
I'd like to get one step ahead
ofthe arrogant son ofa bitch.

809
01:03:25,710 --> 01:03:29,110
I thought you liked
the arrogant son of a bitch?

810
01:03:29,150 --> 01:03:33,110
-Welcome to London, Mr. Ross.
Business or pleasure? - Oh, yes.

811
01:03:33,190 --> 01:03:35,830
- I beg your pardon?
- Oh. A little ofboth.

812
01:03:35,910 --> 01:03:39,790
- I'm here to see my publisher. I'm writing
a book. - How long do you plan to stay?

813
01:03:39,830 --> 01:03:43,750
That depends. I'm waiting for
some colleagues to catch upwith me.

814
01:03:43,830 --> 01:03:45,750
- Enjoy your visit.
- Thank you.

815
01:03:45,830 --> 01:03:47,750
- What's the name of the book?
- Hopscotch.

816
01:03:47,830 --> 01:03:49,830
Good title.

817
01:04:03,550 --> 01:04:05,470
- Glen.
- How are you doing?

818
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:09,150
- Will she see us? - She'll see you. You
won't get anywhere. I've already tried.

819
01:04:09,190 --> 01:04:12,390
Well, maybe she'll be more
accessible to me. I'm an old friend.

820
01:04:12,470 --> 01:04:16,670
- Yaskov's in town. He wants to see you.
- That's good. I'd like that.

821
01:04:16,750 --> 01:04:18,990
Set a time and place
for this afternoon.

822
01:04:19,070 --> 01:04:22,230
You're looking very tired, Joe.

823
01:04:22,310 --> 01:04:26,550
- It's the jet lag. I can't get used to it.
- You sure that's all it is?

824
01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:30,510
Now, listen, Isobel. We're
both fond ofthis character...

825
01:04:30,590 --> 01:04:34,150
but he's making an ass of himself,
and he's got to cut it out.

826
01:04:34,230 --> 01:04:37,710
- For his own good.
- For his own good?

827
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:41,030
You've been trying to stop him, and
I gather not having too much success.

828
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:43,710
Such a shame.
All those bright young men.

829
01:04:43,790 --> 01:04:47,830
And there he is, single-handedly
running rings around you all.

830
01:04:47,910 --> 01:04:50,310
He's very good.
He's as good as they come.

831
01:04:50,390 --> 01:04:53,830
And he is running rings around us,
and I'm his biggest fan.

832
01:04:54,910 --> 01:04:57,030
But Kendig is going
to make a mistake.

833
01:04:57,070 --> 01:05:00,670
Sooner orlater, he's bound to slip.
Afterall, he's only human.

834
01:05:00,750 --> 01:05:05,030
- Oh, he's extremely human.
- It's not funny, Isobel.

835
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:09,550
We're not the only people looking for him.
If the Russians get to him before we do...

836
01:05:09,590 --> 01:05:14,070
You mean Myerson's methods of termination
are more humane than the Russians'?

837
01:05:14,150 --> 01:05:16,990
You know what I mean.

838
01:05:17,070 --> 01:05:21,590
I don't want to hurt him, Isobel. But I
have a job to do, and I'm going to do it.

839
01:05:21,670 --> 01:05:23,950
He's got to stop
that book right now.

840
01:05:24,030 --> 01:05:28,510
He's hadhis fun. He's made a fool
out of everyone. Now he has to stop.

841
01:05:28,590 --> 01:05:31,430
He has to stop
ifhe's going to stay alive.

842
01:05:32,710 --> 01:05:36,310
- Will you tell him?
- Oh, I'll tell him.

843
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:38,470
I don't think he'll stop.

844
01:05:38,550 --> 01:05:40,910
Oh. You've forgotten your beer.

845
01:05:51,110 --> 01:05:54,950
- Hi. I'm looking for Mr. Ludlow.
- Ah, you mean Mr. Ludlum.

846
01:05:55,030 --> 01:05:57,790
- You'll find him in his office
up there, gov. - Thank you.

847
01:06:06,870 --> 01:06:09,030
- Mr. Ludlum?
- Yes, sir.

848
01:06:09,110 --> 01:06:11,830
I understand you have
a little old airplane for sale.

849
01:06:11,910 --> 01:06:14,670
- I'm Ross. I called you this morning.
- Ah, yes, sir. Yes.

850
01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:17,710
- You'd like to take a little look,
would you? - Yeah, please.

851
01:06:18,830 --> 01:06:21,270
She's a Stampe, sir.

852
01:06:21,350 --> 01:06:24,350
Oh, the Belgian version
ofthe old Tiger Moth.

853
01:06:24,390 --> 01:06:27,230
- Yes, indeed. You know your aircraft, sir.
- Mm.

854
01:06:27,310 --> 01:06:30,390
She trained a lot of good
fighter pilots in her day.

855
01:06:30,470 --> 01:06:33,990
- How many hours on the engine? - A hundred
and eighteen since the last overhaul.

856
01:06:34,070 --> 01:06:37,390
- A hundred and eighty? -
Eighteen, sir. One-eight.

857
01:06:37,470 --> 01:06:41,270
- She's generally in very good shape.
- How much are you asking?

858
01:06:41,350 --> 01:06:44,430
Well, you'll need to have a look at
the logs and certifications, won't you?

859
01:06:44,510 --> 01:06:48,430
- So let's nip back to the office and
see what we can do. - Okay.

860
01:06:55,390 --> 01:06:59,710
Look at Yaskov. He must have
seen Casablanca 12 times.

861
01:07:04,550 --> 01:07:06,550
You better wait here.

862
01:07:13,430 --> 01:07:16,430
- I know where he is.
- Who's that, comrade?

863
01:07:17,630 --> 01:07:20,870
May I suggest we pool
our information?

864
01:07:20,950 --> 01:07:25,510
If I tell you the city, you will know
how to find him in that city, yes?

865
01:07:25,550 --> 01:07:31,070
- A new wrinkle on detente. - That
manuscript is an embarrassment to us all.

866
01:07:31,150 --> 01:07:35,070
If you catch him, your people will squeeze
him. We're not crazy about that idea.

867
01:07:35,150 --> 01:07:38,070
At the moment, we feel it is more
important he be neutralized.

868
01:07:38,150 --> 01:07:42,310
He knows too much about
our side, as well as yours.

869
01:07:42,390 --> 01:07:44,790
Well?

870
01:07:44,870 --> 01:07:46,790
Sorry.

871
01:07:46,870 --> 01:07:49,430
Very well.
He is back in London.

872
01:07:51,790 --> 01:07:54,110
He flew there from Bermuda
two days ago.

873
01:07:54,190 --> 01:07:59,350
- He's traveling under the name
of Leonard Ross. - That figures.

874
01:07:59,430 --> 01:08:02,710
I'd like to be able to tell you that we
found him through brilliant detective work.

875
01:08:02,790 --> 01:08:08,550
But in actual fact, one of my men just
happened to recognize him at Heathrow.

876
01:08:08,630 --> 01:08:12,270
I will want a quid pro quo
one day, my good friend.

877
01:08:12,350 --> 01:08:14,470
I bet you will.

878
01:08:14,550 --> 01:08:16,550
See you in London.

879
01:08:19,710 --> 01:08:21,670
- Well?
- He's in London.

880
01:08:21,710 --> 01:08:25,710
- He gave you that for free? - Of course
not. Nothing's free with that old fox.

881
01:08:25,790 --> 01:08:28,350
But it does tell us one thing.

882
01:08:28,430 --> 01:08:31,430
- The Russians are just as nervous
as we are. - You're learning.

883
01:08:31,510 --> 01:08:34,630
By the way, he's traveling
on your passport.

884
01:08:46,070 --> 01:08:49,150
That's cheaper too.

885
01:08:55,710 --> 01:08:58,550
Uh, no, I'm sorry. Sorry.

886
01:08:58,630 --> 01:09:02,390
- Parlez-vous Francais, monsieur?
- No, no. This...

887
01:09:02,470 --> 01:09:04,710
Can you speak French
or German, either of you?

888
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:07,310
Does Alfie Booker
still work here?

889
01:09:08,990 --> 01:09:12,550
- Yeah. He's out in the back.
- May I speak to him for a moment, please?

890
01:09:12,630 --> 01:09:15,150
- Sure. Help yourself.
- Thank you.

891
01:09:17,190 --> 01:09:20,470
- Here, I'll take this one myself.
- Yeah, I like that one.

892
01:09:25,670 --> 01:09:28,470
Alfred P. Booker.

893
01:09:28,550 --> 01:09:32,070
Mr. Kendig. Hey, it's good to see you.
It's been two years.

894
01:09:32,110 --> 01:09:34,070
- You lost a little weight, didn't you?
- Yeah.

895
01:09:34,150 --> 01:09:37,950
- Hey, how'd that transistor job
go for you? - The transistor?

896
01:09:37,990 --> 01:09:42,470
What... Oh, they never even
knew it was there. Not a clue.

897
01:09:42,550 --> 01:09:44,990
I have something a little more
difficult for you this time.

898
01:09:45,070 --> 01:09:47,230
May I come
around here, please?

899
01:09:51,710 --> 01:09:54,190
Tell me how practical
you think that is.

900
01:10:01,110 --> 01:10:04,150
- Where are we staying?
- The Hilton. - Good.

901
01:10:04,230 --> 01:10:07,110
And I set up a meeting for this
afternoon with British Intelligence.

902
01:10:07,190 --> 01:10:09,550
Yeah, well, there's no problem
with the electronic stuff.

903
01:10:09,630 --> 01:10:13,230
That's dead easy. But it's the
mechanics I'm not sure about.

904
01:10:13,310 --> 01:10:17,950
Servo motors, some sort
of hydraulic transfer.

905
01:10:17,990 --> 01:10:21,190
Look, there is a chap I know in the
navy, used to know all about this stuff.

906
01:10:21,270 --> 01:10:24,390
Do you want me to get ahold of
him and see ifhe can help us?

907
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:27,470
- How low do you think it will take?
- Give me a ring tonight.

908
01:10:27,510 --> 01:10:29,750
I'll know by then if I can get
a hold of him. And if I can...

909
01:10:29,830 --> 01:10:33,190
I'll go down to the field
tomorrow morning.

910
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:35,710
Could have it installed for you
by nightfall. How's that sound?

911
01:10:35,790 --> 01:10:40,230
All right, I'll call you. Just give me
your home phone number, if you please.

912
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:42,270
Yeah.

913
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:49,470
You understand, Sir Giles, this requires
a certain delicacy on all our parts.

914
01:10:49,550 --> 01:10:52,710
Yes, I'm sure it must be terribly
embarrassing for all of you.

915
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:54,761
Of course, we in
England would never allow

916
01:10:54,762 --> 01:10:57,190
ourselves to get into such
a ridiculous predicament.

917
01:10:57,230 --> 01:11:00,030
- You see, what we need is...
- Yes, yes, yes, I know.

918
01:11:00,070 --> 01:11:02,390
But it's quite fascinating,
isn't it? The part where...

919
01:11:02,470 --> 01:11:05,670
I think it's chapter three...
the bit about Somoza, Nicaragua.

920
01:11:05,710 --> 01:11:08,390
Your Kendig's got
quite a sense of humor.

921
01:11:08,470 --> 01:11:11,590
Sir Giles, we would appreciate it
if we could move forward with this.

922
01:11:11,670 --> 01:11:15,230
Technically, it's not our problem,
is it? He's broken no laws in Britain.

923
01:11:15,310 --> 01:11:19,310
But, of course, hands across the sea and
all that. We'll be happy to cooperate.

924
01:11:19,390 --> 01:11:22,910
- Now, what exactly would you like
to have us do? -Manpower.

925
01:11:22,990 --> 01:11:25,190
We'd like you to put a lot
of people on the ports of exit...

926
01:11:25,270 --> 01:11:27,270
airlines, terminals, that stuff.

927
01:11:27,350 --> 01:11:30,680
Well, that does seem
to be rather fruitless.

928
01:11:30,730 --> 01:11:32,470
We don't really know what he looks like.

929
01:11:32,550 --> 01:11:35,190
We do have this, sir.

930
01:11:35,270 --> 01:11:38,390
Ah. Thank you.
Which one is, uh...

931
01:11:38,470 --> 01:11:41,710
Well, that's Yaskov.
What's he doing with Yaskov?

932
01:11:41,790 --> 01:11:44,910
- That's part of our problem.
- The main thing is...

933
01:11:44,990 --> 01:11:46,910
I'll have a word with the police.

934
01:11:46,990 --> 01:11:49,830
- We'll circulate copies of this to all
ports of exit. - The main thing is...

935
01:11:49,910 --> 01:11:53,350
he's come to England for a reason;
he didn't pick it out of a hat.

936
01:11:53,390 --> 01:11:55,790
We think he's here to
find a publisher.

937
01:11:55,850 --> 01:11:57,590
There can only be so many
publishers in London.

938
01:11:57,670 --> 01:12:01,790
A dozen or so major houses.
Perhaps 30 or 40 small presses.

939
01:12:01,870 --> 01:12:04,590
He wants to make a big noise,
so he'd go to a big house.

940
01:12:04,630 --> 01:12:07,030
But I think that's what
he'll think we're thinking...

941
01:12:07,070 --> 01:12:08,950
so I think he'll
go to a small one.

942
01:12:09,030 --> 01:12:12,790
All right. I've got friends
in some of the publishing firms.

943
01:12:12,870 --> 01:12:15,230
I'll get in touch
and let you know what I learn.

944
01:12:15,310 --> 01:12:17,670
- Where are you staying?
- The Hilton.

945
01:12:17,710 --> 01:12:22,270
Yes, of course. I'll ring the Hilton the
instant we've got anything of interest.

946
01:12:23,550 --> 01:12:25,670
Good-bye, Mr. Myerson.

947
01:12:27,270 --> 01:12:31,350
- Yes, can I help you? - Can you call
Salzburg, Austria, for me, please?

948
01:12:33,230 --> 01:12:36,190
Yes, of course.
If you'd like to sit down...

949
01:12:36,230 --> 01:12:38,910
- I'll tell you as soon as we get through.
- Thank you.

950
01:13:15,230 --> 01:13:18,790
-The feathers in what?
- The Feathers Inn.

951
01:13:18,870 --> 01:13:21,310
The Feathers Inn.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

952
01:13:21,350 --> 01:13:25,150
- Don't you remember, darling?
-Of course I remember, darling.

953
01:13:32,790 --> 01:13:35,950
Why don't you go get
some lunch. I'll take over.

954
01:13:35,990 --> 01:13:37,990
All right. Thanks.

955
01:13:52,990 --> 01:13:55,990
Ah, Mr. Follett. Come in.

956
01:13:58,870 --> 01:14:00,870
Thankyou.

957
01:14:11,590 --> 01:14:14,390
- What'd you want to see me about?
- Won't you sit down?

958
01:14:17,350 --> 01:14:21,630
I wanted to see you: A... Because I'm
tired of being watched 24 hours a day...

959
01:14:21,710 --> 01:14:24,470
and feel that you and I could come
to some more civilized arraignment.

960
01:14:24,550 --> 01:14:29,190
And B... I have just been speaking
on the telephone with Kendig.

961
01:14:29,270 --> 01:14:31,470
- Where was he calling from?
- He didn't say.

962
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:35,390
He did say, however, he feels that this
has now become a ridiculous charade...

963
01:14:35,470 --> 01:14:37,430
that we should all stop playing.

964
01:14:37,510 --> 01:14:39,990
We'd be delighted
to stop playing.

965
01:14:40,070 --> 01:14:42,630
- Would you like a drink?
- Thank you.

966
01:14:42,710 --> 01:14:44,630
A little whiskey maybe.

967
01:14:44,710 --> 01:14:49,270
Good. Kendig would
like to speak to you...

968
01:14:49,350 --> 01:14:52,750
because he's too emotionally
involved with the others.

969
01:14:52,830 --> 01:14:55,270
He said he would telephone
about 1:30, which is...

970
01:14:55,350 --> 01:14:59,950
Oh, in 15 minutes. I said I felt sure
you would be here to take the call.

971
01:15:00,030 --> 01:15:03,470
No ice. Excuse me.

972
01:15:03,550 --> 01:15:06,910
Oh, no, no, no.
That's, uh, uh, fine.

973
01:15:06,990 --> 01:15:11,670
Oh, please. An American without
ice in his drink is unthinkable...

974
01:15:11,750 --> 01:15:14,350
if not unconstitutional.

975
01:15:56,150 --> 01:15:58,430
Nice boy.

976
01:15:58,470 --> 01:16:01,550
Goodboy.

977
01:16:01,630 --> 01:16:04,310
Nice dog.

978
01:16:10,150 --> 01:16:13,430
Stay. Stay.

979
01:16:15,550 --> 01:16:18,070
Good boy.

980
01:16:22,470 --> 01:16:25,630
Stupid animal.

981
01:16:26,830 --> 01:16:30,310
It's absolutely dynamite.

982
01:16:30,390 --> 01:16:32,630
It could be our biggest
book of the year.

983
01:16:34,750 --> 01:16:38,830
Although, uh, I still want to
see the last chapter, of course.

984
01:16:38,870 --> 01:16:43,110
I happen to have it right in my
pocket. Finished it this morning.

985
01:16:43,190 --> 01:16:48,150
- Splendid. I'm sure I shan't
be disappointed. - Cheers.

986
01:16:48,190 --> 01:16:50,230
Cheers.

987
01:16:55,110 --> 01:16:58,110
Mr. Westlake, you probably
won't see me again.

988
01:16:58,190 --> 01:17:01,350
I've given someone
a power of attorney...

989
01:17:01,430 --> 01:17:04,870
to get in touch with you
regarding contracts and payments.

990
01:17:04,950 --> 01:17:10,070
Under the circumstances, your absence
will probably be our best publicity.

991
01:17:10,150 --> 01:17:12,950
You're at considerable risk,
aren't you?

992
01:17:13,030 --> 01:17:16,630
Well, if you publish this, you're
going to be taking a risk yourself.

993
01:17:16,710 --> 01:17:21,150
We've dealt with controversy
before. The spice of life.

994
01:17:21,230 --> 01:17:26,430
These fellows don't play by the
Marquis of Queen... It-It is Marquis?

995
01:17:26,510 --> 01:17:29,470
- Yes, Marquis.
- Marquis of Queensbury rules, you know.

996
01:17:29,550 --> 01:17:32,390
Well, I certainly hope not.
Not half so much fun.

997
01:17:43,190 --> 01:17:45,190
You wait here.

998
01:18:04,630 --> 01:18:06,590
Mr. Westlake, I'm terribly sorry.
These gentlemen...

999
01:18:06,630 --> 01:18:08,710
- It's about the Kendig manuscript.
- That's all right.

1000
01:18:08,790 --> 01:18:11,230
- I've been looking forward to this.
- Good.

1001
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:12,900
Glad you're not gonna try one of those

1002
01:18:12,935 --> 01:18:15,510
I-don't-know-what-
you're-talking-about stories.

1003
01:18:15,590 --> 01:18:17,950
My name is Parker Westlake.

1004
01:18:18,030 --> 01:18:20,470
- The point is...
- What's yours?

1005
01:18:20,550 --> 01:18:23,190
- What?
- What are your names?

1006
01:18:24,350 --> 01:18:26,310
Smith and Jones.

1007
01:18:26,350 --> 01:18:30,070
From my reading ofthe manuscript,
you have to be Myerson.

1008
01:18:30,150 --> 01:18:33,710
Are you Joe Cutter, by any chance?
I'm glad to meet you.

1009
01:18:33,790 --> 01:18:37,990
Now, please, why don't we sit down
and reason this thing together?

1010
01:18:38,070 --> 01:18:41,630
Why don't you give us the
manuscript? You can't publish it.

1011
01:18:41,710 --> 01:18:44,030
I think you're wrong about that.

1012
01:18:48,150 --> 01:18:50,750
Tell him, Joe.

1013
01:18:50,830 --> 01:18:53,390
I'm afraid he's right.

1014
01:18:53,470 --> 01:18:57,750
I don't like to make threats.
They sound foolish in the daylight.

1015
01:18:57,830 --> 01:19:00,870
But I am to infer that if I
don't give you the manuscript...

1016
01:19:00,950 --> 01:19:03,430
you'll creep in here
one dark night and take it.

1017
01:19:03,510 --> 01:19:06,910
Oris it more along
the lines of, uh...

1018
01:19:06,990 --> 01:19:11,350
if you don't cooperate with us,
we'll set off bombs in your offices?

1019
01:19:11,390 --> 01:19:13,590
You said it, we didn't.

1020
01:19:13,670 --> 01:19:16,230
Gentlemen, let me
tell you something.

1021
01:19:16,310 --> 01:19:18,204
I think this is one of the most exciting

1022
01:19:18,205 --> 01:19:20,430
literary properties
I've seen in a long time.

1023
01:19:20,510 --> 01:19:23,070
It simply isn't possible
for you to suppress it.

1024
01:19:23,150 --> 01:19:26,910
Let me caution you. I've run
off copies of the manuscript...

1025
01:19:26,990 --> 01:19:28,910
and had them put
in safe places.

1026
01:19:28,990 --> 01:19:33,150
So even if I suffer
an unfortunate accident...

1027
01:19:33,230 --> 01:19:36,030
the process of publication
will continue.

1028
01:19:36,110 --> 01:19:39,750
Naturally, we don't intend to
use our usual printing house.

1029
01:19:39,830 --> 01:19:42,110
So no one will know
where the book is...

1030
01:19:42,190 --> 01:19:45,990
until it's far too late tostop
its distribution to the bookshops.

1031
01:19:46,030 --> 01:19:49,110
I think your friend Kendig...

1032
01:19:49,190 --> 01:19:52,430
has you well and truly
by the short hairs.

1033
01:19:55,630 --> 01:19:58,270
If you publish that book, you're
signing his death warrant.

1034
01:19:58,350 --> 01:20:01,110
There's only one man who can stop
the publication of that book...

1035
01:20:01,190 --> 01:20:03,310
and that's Kendig himself.

1036
01:20:03,390 --> 01:20:05,470
Why don't you
talk to him about it?

1037
01:20:12,390 --> 01:20:14,770
- We can't find the bastard.
- Find him?

1038
01:20:14,815 --> 01:20:16,510
My dear fellow, where's
the difficulty in that?

1039
01:20:16,590 --> 01:20:19,790
He's staying right here in London
at the Windsor Hotel.

1040
01:20:19,870 --> 01:20:22,830
- What?
- The Windsor Hotel in Landcaster Gate...

1041
01:20:22,870 --> 01:20:25,110
just north ofthe park.

1042
01:20:27,110 --> 01:20:29,110
Thank you.

1043
01:20:54,710 --> 01:20:59,270
Room 416. Apparently,
he's expecting us.

1044
01:21:03,670 --> 01:21:06,110
We'll take the stairs.

1045
01:21:07,790 --> 01:21:11,070
- How'd you get here?
- He telephoned my embassy.

1046
01:21:11,110 --> 01:21:13,870
- He's very democratic, isn't he?
- Yes, isn't he?

1047
01:21:13,950 --> 01:21:17,990
I do like him, you know.
One can't help it.

1048
01:21:37,390 --> 01:21:39,470
Come on.
He's not gonna shoot you.

1049
01:21:40,510 --> 01:21:42,510
Shh.

1050
01:21:43,870 --> 01:21:46,070
Kendig?

1051
01:22:26,510 --> 01:22:28,510
Close the door.

1052
01:22:42,790 --> 01:22:44,870
So he's expecting us, huh?

1053
01:22:46,630 --> 01:22:48,630
Hello, boys.

1054
01:22:49,870 --> 01:22:52,070
Thanks for coming.

1055
01:22:52,150 --> 01:22:54,870
Why don't you sit down?
Make yourselves comfortable.

1056
01:22:54,950 --> 01:22:58,110
Joe, give everyone
a drink, will ya?

1057
01:22:58,150 --> 01:23:00,710
Whiskey is right there
next to the tape recorder...

1058
01:23:00,790 --> 01:23:04,190
and there's some ice,
ifit hasn't melted by this time.

1059
01:23:04,270 --> 01:23:08,190
Sorry there's no vodka, Yaskov.
I simply forgot it.

1060
01:23:08,230 --> 01:23:12,710
- Myerson, couldn't find
any bourbon and coke.

1061
01:23:12,790 --> 01:23:15,430
I suppose you're
wondering where I am.

1062
01:23:16,910 --> 01:23:19,230
Well, we know I'm not
about to try the airports...

1063
01:23:19,270 --> 01:23:22,070
the boat-trains
and the liners in Southampton...

1064
01:23:22,150 --> 01:23:25,830
the trains to Scotland
and the ferryboats to Ireland.

1065
01:23:25,910 --> 01:23:28,750
Did you think of Ireland, Joe,
or did you slip up on that one?

1066
01:23:28,830 --> 01:23:30,910
We thought of it.

1067
01:23:30,950 --> 01:23:35,030
Well, I'll give you a clue
as to my whereabouts later on.

1068
01:23:35,110 --> 01:23:38,710
In the meanwhile, the reason I
asked you all to come up here...

1069
01:23:38,790 --> 01:23:42,950
is 'cause I want you to pick up
a copy of my last chapter.

1070
01:23:43,030 --> 01:23:46,350
It's sitting on top
ofthe chest of drawers...

1071
01:23:46,430 --> 01:23:49,350
right next to the recorder.

1072
01:23:49,430 --> 01:23:51,470
That's all. Why don't you
take it home and read it?

1073
01:23:51,550 --> 01:23:53,830
Enjoy yourselves.
Have a good time.

1074
01:23:53,910 --> 01:23:57,310
Thanks very much for coming,
and, uh, good night.

1075
01:23:58,990 --> 01:24:01,710
Shit.

1076
01:24:17,230 --> 01:24:19,350
- Good night.
- Good night.

1077
01:24:23,350 --> 01:24:25,470
- Good night, Joe.
- Yep.

1078
01:25:14,870 --> 01:25:18,150
Good grief, Joe,
you look terrible.

1079
01:25:18,190 --> 01:25:21,470
Well, you've been keeping me
up past my regular bedtime.

1080
01:25:21,550 --> 01:25:24,710
Mm. Chair, please.

1081
01:25:26,750 --> 01:25:31,030
- Myerson thrown in the towel yet?
- He wants to see you dead.

1082
01:25:31,070 --> 01:25:35,470
Oh, it doesn't make any difference
whether I'm dead or alive, Joe.

1083
01:25:35,510 --> 01:25:37,750
He's all washed up now.
Doesn't he know that?

1084
01:25:37,830 --> 01:25:41,430
Lean forward, please.
Hands behind your back.

1085
01:25:41,510 --> 01:25:43,870
- How come he hasn't quit yet?
- He's a little bit like you.

1086
01:25:43,950 --> 01:25:48,390
- He won't quit until he gets even.
- Should be even by now.

1087
01:25:48,430 --> 01:25:51,790
He tried to emasculate me,
and I retaliated.

1088
01:25:53,390 --> 01:25:55,590
- What's your game plan now?
- There isn't any. The game's over.

1089
01:25:55,670 --> 01:25:57,990
It's all finished.
I've had my fun.

1090
01:25:58,030 --> 01:26:01,230
- It's too late for that.
I've got my orders. -Ahh.

1091
01:26:01,270 --> 01:26:06,230
I understand, Joe. You'll never
see me again after tonight.

1092
01:26:06,270 --> 01:26:08,270
- I'll find ya.
- No.

1093
01:26:08,350 --> 01:26:10,510
Did you pick up
my last, uh, chapter?

1094
01:26:10,590 --> 01:26:12,990
Yes, I did. And I think
you went a little bit too far.

1095
01:26:13,070 --> 01:26:16,470
- Oh, I don't think so.
- You know, I don't understand you.

1096
01:26:16,550 --> 01:26:18,830
It's not like you to paint
yourself into a corner.

1097
01:26:18,910 --> 01:26:21,310
But I don't see where
you've got any back door.

1098
01:26:21,390 --> 01:26:24,270
- You're my back door, Joe.
- I can't do you any favors.

1099
01:26:24,350 --> 01:26:27,630
- Sure you can. You already did.
- I did?

1100
01:26:27,710 --> 01:26:30,990
You know I'd never use this.
You didn't do anything about it.

1101
01:26:32,230 --> 01:26:34,950
I'm gonna have to put
a gag in your mouth, Joe.

1102
01:26:35,030 --> 01:26:37,870
The cleaning lady will
turn you loose in the morning.

1103
01:26:37,910 --> 01:26:41,230
- I hope she's pretty.
- Open your mouth.

1104
01:27:00,230 --> 01:27:04,990
Oh, uh, you can call
your crowd off the airport.

1105
01:27:05,030 --> 01:27:07,590
I've got a little plane
on the coast near Beachy Head.

1106
01:27:07,670 --> 01:27:10,750
I'll be taking off first thing
in the morning across the Channel.

1107
01:27:16,470 --> 01:27:19,150
No bullets.
I'm proud of you, Joe.

1108
01:28:16,070 --> 01:28:19,430
- Yeah?
- Hello?

1109
01:28:19,470 --> 01:28:21,790
- Hello?
- Hello?

1110
01:28:21,870 --> 01:28:26,230
Joe Cutter is tied to a chair
in his room.

1111
01:28:26,310 --> 01:28:28,830
You'd better cut him loose.

1112
01:28:28,910 --> 01:28:31,110
What? Who is this?

1113
01:28:31,190 --> 01:28:33,950
This is Eleanor Roosevelt.

1114
01:28:35,190 --> 01:28:38,590
What? Who is...

1115
01:28:38,630 --> 01:28:40,630
Hello?

1116
01:28:55,510 --> 01:28:58,110
- Hello.
- Hello, Is? Did you make it?

1117
01:28:58,190 --> 01:29:00,510
No. No, I didn't make it.

1118
01:29:00,550 --> 01:29:04,110
This is a recording of
a person asleep. How are you?

1119
01:29:04,150 --> 01:29:08,270
Right on schedule.
As of now, the clock is running.

1120
01:29:08,350 --> 01:29:11,830
- Well, where is it running?
- The Pond Gemington.

1121
01:29:11,910 --> 01:29:13,830
The Pond where?

1122
01:29:13,910 --> 01:29:16,790
The Pond, near that
beautiful graveyard.

1123
01:29:16,830 --> 01:29:19,510
You know, the one
with the Norman church.

1124
01:29:19,590 --> 01:29:24,110
And all those cold stones. Yes, yes, I
remember. I'll see you there in an hour.

1125
01:29:38,190 --> 01:29:40,190
Damn it!

1126
01:30:00,270 --> 01:30:02,350
Police. Thank God.

1127
01:30:02,430 --> 01:30:05,070
You fellas are never supposed
to be around when you're needed.

1128
01:30:05,150 --> 01:30:08,630
- Having a spot of trouble, sir?
- Yeah. I got a flat tire there.

1129
01:30:08,710 --> 01:30:11,750
I just made a telephone call,
came back, tire was flat...

1130
01:30:11,830 --> 01:30:14,470
- and there's no spare in there.
- Your car, sir?

1131
01:30:14,550 --> 01:30:18,230
- No, it's a rental. - Well, that's
where the spare should be, sir.

1132
01:30:18,310 --> 01:30:20,830
Yeah, but it's not there.

1133
01:30:22,470 --> 01:30:25,310
Listen, superspy, I wouldn't tell
Myerson about this if I were you.

1134
01:30:25,390 --> 01:30:28,870
- Fuck, Myerson.
- Oh, by the way, did he get your passport?

1135
01:30:31,270 --> 01:30:34,790
- Where you from in America, sir?
- Flagstaff, Arizona.

1136
01:30:34,870 --> 01:30:38,470
Hey, is there a place around here I can
rent a car? I got to get to Eastbourne.

1137
01:30:38,550 --> 01:30:41,230
Well, it might be a bit difficult
at this time of the morning, sir.

1138
01:30:41,310 --> 01:30:44,870
Why don't you come back to the station
and wait for one ofthe garages to open?

1139
01:30:44,950 --> 01:30:47,070
We'll make you
a nice cup of coffee.

1140
01:30:49,270 --> 01:30:54,830
We'll be at the Lambath heliport
in 15 or 20 minutes. Right.

1141
01:30:54,910 --> 01:30:57,270
If he doesn't take off before
daylight, we mightjust catch him.

1142
01:30:57,350 --> 01:31:00,030
-What time is daylight?
- About 7:00. It's 6:15 now.

1143
01:31:00,110 --> 01:31:02,590
- Is a cab waiting for us downstairs?
-Yes, sir.

1144
01:31:34,510 --> 01:31:37,870
- Now I want to know...
- I owe him one.

1145
01:31:37,910 --> 01:31:40,590
This is the quid pro quo, right?

1146
01:31:48,430 --> 01:31:50,350
I'm in a little bit
of a hurry, sir.

1147
01:31:50,430 --> 01:31:52,990
Um, is there any chance of
getting an all-night taxi service...

1148
01:31:53,070 --> 01:31:56,310
from Brighton or Seaford
or one of those places?

1149
01:31:56,390 --> 01:32:00,790
Here, Sarge, didn't old Tony Cosgrove
used to run some sort of taxi service?

1150
01:32:00,830 --> 01:32:04,270
- Yeah. If he's still alive.
- He's still alive, all right.

1151
01:32:04,350 --> 01:32:07,350
Give him a go, Harry. We'll
have you away in no time, sir.

1152
01:32:07,430 --> 01:32:09,750
Thank you very much.
Sure appreciate it.

1153
01:32:11,230 --> 01:32:13,670
Now, let's see.
Tony Cosgrove.

1154
01:32:27,070 --> 01:32:29,110
This time we'll
get there before him.

1155
01:32:29,190 --> 01:32:31,830
He'll never expect us
to get a copter up.

1156
01:32:31,910 --> 01:32:35,910
- You could be right.
- You bet your fucking ass I'm right.

1157
01:32:39,150 --> 01:32:42,270
Straight along the A-20.
How long do you think you'll be?

1158
01:32:42,350 --> 01:32:44,990
- Oh, about half an hour.
- It'll be about 30 minutes, sir.

1159
01:32:45,070 --> 01:32:47,550
Excuse me, sir, but what
did you say your name was?

1160
01:32:47,630 --> 01:32:51,710
- Burton. Henry Burton.
- Oh, yes, that's right. Thank you, sir.

1161
01:32:51,790 --> 01:32:54,430
I wonder if you could show me
some means of identification?

1162
01:32:54,510 --> 01:33:00,270
- Sure. You want a passport?
Driver's license? - Either, sir.

1163
01:33:02,190 --> 01:33:04,150
- There.
- Thank you.

1164
01:33:10,350 --> 01:33:13,270
You do rather look
a bit like this chap, sir.

1165
01:33:13,350 --> 01:33:16,390
But I'm sure it had nothing to do
with you. Just a coincidence, eh?

1166
01:33:17,590 --> 01:33:19,510
We've had a bulletin, you see.

1167
01:33:19,590 --> 01:33:22,510
An American that you rather
resemble is wanted for questioning.

1168
01:33:24,750 --> 01:33:26,750
Hmm.

1169
01:33:26,830 --> 01:33:29,950
Well, I guess I look like
everybody and his brother.

1170
01:33:30,030 --> 01:33:33,710
What has this, uh...
What is this fellow wanted for?

1171
01:33:33,750 --> 01:33:37,950
Oh, nothing in particular. Just some people
would like to ask him a few questions.

1172
01:33:39,230 --> 01:33:41,790
Oh, what the hell's going on
here with the lights?

1173
01:34:45,430 --> 01:34:49,430
- Oh, hi, there. - Morning. When
did you join the police force?

1174
01:34:49,510 --> 01:34:52,830
- It's the only car I could find that
had any gas in it. - Good thinking.

1175
01:34:52,910 --> 01:34:56,030
Listen, no matterwhat happens,
you stay put right here.

1176
01:34:56,110 --> 01:34:58,550
- I'll be back within an hour, okay?
- Okay.

1177
01:34:58,630 --> 01:35:00,698
And if you're not back
within the hour, I'll wait

1178
01:35:00,699 --> 01:35:02,950
for another hour
and another and another...

1179
01:37:04,670 --> 01:37:07,750
Follow him!

1180
01:39:47,230 --> 01:39:49,990
Jesus!

1181
01:39:50,070 --> 01:39:52,790
Wow! I guess that
takes care of Mr. Kendig.

1182
01:39:52,830 --> 01:39:54,910
That takes
care of him, all right.

1183
01:39:54,990 --> 01:39:57,510
The son of a bitch is down there
in that undertow in 47 pieces.

1184
01:39:59,510 --> 01:40:01,510
The son of a gun
is dead finally.

1185
01:40:03,310 --> 01:40:05,710
The son of a bitch
better stay dead.

1186
01:40:08,030 --> 01:40:11,110
Pity. I shall miss him.

1187
01:40:42,790 --> 01:40:45,710
- Everything go okay?
- Fine.

1188
01:40:45,750 --> 01:40:49,030
Good.

1189
01:40:49,110 --> 01:40:53,710
- Um, South of France for two
weeks? - Sounds okay. - Good.

1190
01:41:17,430 --> 01:41:20,990
I hope this book is half
as exciting as they say it is.

1191
01:41:21,070 --> 01:41:24,430
Oh, it is. Fourteen weeks, number
one on the best seller list.

1192
01:41:24,510 --> 01:41:27,390
Oh, how marvelous.

1193
01:41:27,430 --> 01:41:31,470
They say he was murdered
by his own men, the C. I. A.

1194
01:41:31,550 --> 01:41:33,630
Do you think there's
any truth in that?

1195
01:41:33,710 --> 01:41:38,030
There are those who say he's
still alive, living in Australia.

1196
01:41:38,070 --> 01:41:41,270
Oh, really?
Oh, is that a fact...

1197
01:41:46,150 --> 01:41:48,430
This is indefensible.

1198
01:41:48,510 --> 01:41:51,790
You must stop
these ridiculous charades.

1199
01:41:51,870 --> 01:41:55,310
The agency thinks you are dead.

1200
01:41:55,390 --> 01:41:59,270
No one, with the possible exception
of me, gives a damn about you.

1201
01:41:59,350 --> 01:42:01,990
If you do not stop
these absurd disguises...

1202
01:42:02,070 --> 01:42:04,830
I will personally rip
that beard from your chin...

1203
01:42:04,910 --> 01:42:07,830
and scream "fire"
at the top of myvoice.

1204
01:42:07,870 --> 01:42:10,070
Okay, okay.
You madeyour point.

1205
01:42:10,150 --> 01:42:14,670
Good. How'd you like to play
some gin this evening?

1206
01:42:14,750 --> 01:42:17,630
- For how much?
- Will you never learn?
