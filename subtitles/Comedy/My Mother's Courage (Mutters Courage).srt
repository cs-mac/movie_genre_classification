Captain McVay, what, pray tell,

1506
01:47:25,863 --> 01:47:27,280
is your theory on zigzagging?

1507

Not so effective
against kaitens,

1508
01:47:29,491 --> 01:47:32,539
It's a new Japanese weapon
a manned suicide torpedo,

1509
01:47:32,540 --> 01:47:34,829
<i>like an underwater

1520
01:47:57,394 --> 01:47:59,901
We had survived
multiple attacks before

1521
01:47:59,902 --> 01:48:01,272

- We had no electrical.

Pass the word!
Abandon ship.

1525
01:48:08,489 --> 01:48:11,908
So you called abandon ship
about six to eight minutes
