1
00:01:58,767 --> 00:02:00,325
Extra! Read all about it!

2
00:02:00,967 --> 00:02:04,403
Again a fresh election!

3
00:02:04,967 --> 00:02:06,878
Read all about it! Extra!

4
00:02:12,287 --> 00:02:14,118
Apples. Apples.

5
00:02:14,287 --> 00:02:16,596
Where do you think
you're going?

6
00:02:17,367 --> 00:02:19,244
What do you mean...?

7
00:02:19,407 --> 00:02:22,763
Shut up, you pasty-faced palookas.

8
00:02:24,287 --> 00:02:26,847
Apples, apples.

9
00:02:28,087 --> 00:02:29,122
Apples.

10
00:02:31,807 --> 00:02:32,876
Hey, Annie!

11
00:02:35,687 --> 00:02:38,247
Come round to the house sometime.

12
00:02:38,407 --> 00:02:39,840
I got a lot of silverware
hanging around loose.

13
00:02:40,967 --> 00:02:42,241
Apples.

14
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,442
Hello, Schultzie, how's business?

15
00:02:46,647 --> 00:02:48,285
Not so good over at the Apollo.

16
00:02:48,447 --> 00:02:50,881
Go over to the Casino.
They got a hit over there.

17
00:02:51,047 --> 00:02:53,561
Is that so?
I'll go right over. Thanks.

18
00:02:53,727 --> 00:02:55,364
Yeah.

19
00:02:56,487 --> 00:02:58,239
If you changed your tune,
perhaps you'd have better luck.

20
00:03:06,527 --> 00:03:09,087
The Dude wants to see you, Annie.
He's over at Missouri Martin's.

21
00:03:09,247 --> 00:03:11,044
Yeah, l know.
How's pickings, Smiley?

22
00:03:11,287 --> 00:03:14,279
Terrible. Everybody's broke.
Must be tough on them.

23
00:03:14,447 --> 00:03:17,837
Stop yappin'. Didn't you hear
the President over the radio?

24
00:03:18,167 --> 00:03:21,204
Get on over to the Casino.
They've got a hit over there.

25
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,119
- They have?
- Sure. Spread it around.

26
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:25,721
Don't forget Missouri Martin's.
Dude said it was important.

27
00:03:25,887 --> 00:03:26,886
Alright, l won't.

28
00:03:26,887 --> 00:03:27,966
Apples.

29
00:03:27,967 --> 00:03:29,036
Apples.

30
00:04:18,687 --> 00:04:19,802
Okay, girls.

31
00:04:26,807 --> 00:04:28,081
What's going on?

32
00:04:29,367 --> 00:04:32,006
- What's the mystery?
- Babe, Dude's got a big bet on.

33
00:04:32,167 --> 00:04:34,806
- Yeah, what kind of bet?
- You're liable to scare the fly.

34
00:04:34,967 --> 00:04:35,846
What fly?

35
00:04:35,847 --> 00:04:39,078
Dude bet the Greek the fly would
land on his piece of sugar first.

36
00:04:51,567 --> 00:04:54,559
- What do you say, Dude? 500 more?
- You're on.

37
00:04:57,327 --> 00:05:00,000
What do you think
you're doing, Shakespeare?

38
00:05:00,607 --> 00:05:02,757
I'm decoying him, Dude,
over to your lump.

39
00:05:16,007 --> 00:05:18,885
Tough luck, Dude.
That's 1500 you owe me.

40
00:05:19,047 --> 00:05:21,242
I bet the Greek's got
them flies trained.

41
00:05:21,407 --> 00:05:23,967
Now that the animal act's over,
let's get going.

42
00:05:24,127 --> 00:05:26,038
- Yeah, we better get going.
- Let's blow.

43
00:05:26,207 --> 00:05:28,198
Hey, Dude, l give you
a chance to get even.

44
00:05:28,367 --> 00:05:30,756
- Nothing doing.
- Alright.

45
00:05:35,527 --> 00:05:38,360
This is a lot of hokum,
playing around with flies

46
00:05:38,527 --> 00:05:40,358
when a real sucker's
waiting for us,

47
00:05:40,687 --> 00:05:41,722
with real dough.

48
00:05:41,887 --> 00:05:43,878
What's the matter, handsome?
No luck?

49
00:05:44,047 --> 00:05:46,277
I should have know better than
to bet without my apple.

50
00:05:46,447 --> 00:05:47,721
I'm going to find Apple Annie.

51
00:05:47,887 --> 00:05:50,162
You're searching for her now?

52
00:05:50,327 --> 00:05:53,364
Listen, Happy. This is one of the
biggest stud games l've sat in.

53
00:05:53,527 --> 00:05:56,325
I'm not taking any chances.
Look what just happened to me.

54
00:05:56,487 --> 00:05:58,125
I even lost to the Greek.

55
00:05:58,287 --> 00:06:02,041
Did l tell you about the fella,
superstitious about a hunchback?

56
00:06:02,207 --> 00:06:05,677
He went looking for him one day
and got run over by a truck.

57
00:06:05,847 --> 00:06:07,997
A fella told me it was
hard luck to be superstitious.

58
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:11,876
- Go out and find Apple Annie.
- Okay, Dude. I'm on my way.

59
00:06:12,527 --> 00:06:15,280
I'm a first class monkey
if l can see how you can win pots

60
00:06:15,447 --> 00:06:17,517
by buying apples from
old dames.

61
00:06:17,767 --> 00:06:20,076
Can't find your apple, Dude?
Here's something for good luck.

62
00:06:20,567 --> 00:06:21,761
Cut it out. Cut it out.

63
00:06:21,927 --> 00:06:23,918
He wants apples, not lemons.

64
00:06:24,087 --> 00:06:27,397
Happy, in case you break anything,
make sure it's your neck.

65
00:06:31,327 --> 00:06:32,999
- Hello, Annie.
- Hello, Dude.

66
00:06:33,167 --> 00:06:35,123
- Did l keep you waiting?
- No.

67
00:06:35,287 --> 00:06:36,515
You've got a great racket, Annie.

68
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:39,804
Couple more suckers like the Dude
and you can retire in a year.

69
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:42,640
Pull up your chin, Happy,
you're liable to step on it.

70
00:06:42,807 --> 00:06:45,116
- Never mind the change.
- God bless you.

71
00:06:45,927 --> 00:06:47,918
- So how'd you do last week?
- Okay.

72
00:06:48,727 --> 00:06:50,638
Where were you Saturday?
I couldn't win a race.

73
00:06:50,807 --> 00:06:51,876
Saturday?

74
00:06:52,047 --> 00:06:55,119
I wasn't feeling so good Saturday.

75
00:06:55,287 --> 00:06:58,518
- Drinking again.
- Who? Me?

76
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:02,046
I ain't touched a drop in weeks.

77
00:07:02,207 --> 00:07:05,483
Cut it out. Doc Michel says
your kidneys are all shot.

78
00:07:05,647 --> 00:07:08,207
He's an old fool, doesn't know
what he's talking about.

79
00:07:08,527 --> 00:07:10,757
If you two are going to
discuss Annie's kidneys...

80
00:07:10,927 --> 00:07:12,280
Your car's ready, Mr. Dude.

81
00:07:12,447 --> 00:07:14,324
Mr. Dude,
l can't find her no place.

82
00:07:14,807 --> 00:07:17,002
There you are!
The Dude wants to see you.

83
00:07:17,167 --> 00:07:19,397
Nice work, Shakespeare.
So long, Annie.

84
00:07:20,127 --> 00:07:22,641
I bet the cards
treat you right tonight, Dude.

85
00:07:22,807 --> 00:07:25,480
They will, l'll tell 'em the Dude
bought an apple from Annie.

86
00:07:51,047 --> 00:07:52,116
Did you get it?

87
00:07:53,327 --> 00:07:54,760
Don't l always get it?

88
00:07:56,447 --> 00:07:59,359
- The classiest stationary we have.
- Thank you.

89
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:03,086
- Thank you, Oscar.
- That bunch costs you 50 cents.

90
00:08:03,247 --> 00:08:05,920
50 cents? You never charge me
more than two bits.

91
00:08:06,087 --> 00:08:09,716
It's conditions. People don't leave
things in their rooms anymore.

92
00:08:09,927 --> 00:08:12,646
It's got so bad l have to
buy my own toothpaste.

93
00:08:12,807 --> 00:08:16,197
- That's awful, Oscar.
- Even my wife's complaining.

94
00:08:16,607 --> 00:08:19,201
Remember when she was the
best-smelling woman on the block?

95
00:08:19,367 --> 00:08:23,724
I brought her back so much perfume
she used to stink with it.

96
00:08:23,887 --> 00:08:26,765
- Cheer up. Things will get better.
- I guess so.

97
00:08:26,967 --> 00:08:28,958
When are you expecting
your next letter?

98
00:08:29,127 --> 00:08:32,483
There's a mail boat in
from Spain in the morning.

99
00:08:32,647 --> 00:08:34,239
Okay, l'll watch out for it.

100
00:08:34,407 --> 00:08:36,523
There's a good soul!
I'll pay you beginning of the week.

101
00:08:36,687 --> 00:08:37,915
And don't you forget it.

102
00:08:38,087 --> 00:08:41,159
If l'm caught stealing letters,
l'll get fired.

103
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:44,684
- No, you mustn't get fired.
- They will if they catch me.

104
00:08:45,207 --> 00:08:48,040
Who are you getting
these letters from anyhow?

105
00:08:49,207 --> 00:08:51,086
None of your business.

106
00:08:51,087 --> 00:08:53,396
- A new lover, eh?
- That's it.

107
00:08:54,247 --> 00:08:55,600
A new lover.

108
00:08:55,767 --> 00:08:57,405
You old devil, you.

109
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:15,886
Get out of the way.

110
00:09:17,287 --> 00:09:19,482
That's for getting in the way.

111
00:10:53,127 --> 00:10:54,765
Hey, scat!

112
00:10:57,447 --> 00:10:58,596
The very idea.

113
00:10:59,087 --> 00:11:02,443
Couldn't you find any other place
to sleep on but my picture?

114
00:11:45,207 --> 00:11:46,799
"My dear...

115
00:11:48,767 --> 00:11:49,961
adorable...

116
00:11:51,927 --> 00:11:53,076
daughter.

117
00:11:58,047 --> 00:12:01,164
The social season...

118
00:12:03,447 --> 00:12:07,122
is over.

119
00:12:14,007 --> 00:12:15,122
And so,

120
00:12:19,127 --> 00:12:20,640
the reception...

121
00:12:23,127 --> 00:12:25,641
l came to...

122
00:12:28,167 --> 00:12:30,397
Lord...

123
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:50,961
Lord Woodcliff's."

124
00:12:54,687 --> 00:12:56,245
Here's to Lord Woodcliff.

125
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:08,359
"They say to wish you success."

126
00:13:14,047 --> 00:13:16,117
I just love Annie's music.

127
00:13:27,527 --> 00:13:32,282
"It breaks my heart that l've not
been able to see you these years,

128
00:13:33,767 --> 00:13:37,646
but Doctor Michel, the old crab,

129
00:13:38,647 --> 00:13:43,562
still says it would be fatal
for me to make an ocean voyage.

130
00:13:44,967 --> 00:13:49,119
Your stepfather thought
he might make the trip this year."

131
00:13:50,367 --> 00:13:53,086
You didn't know you had
a stepfather, did you?"

132
00:13:55,607 --> 00:13:57,437
Neither did l.

133
00:13:59,767 --> 00:14:01,644
"The young man you write about

134
00:14:03,087 --> 00:14:05,396
sounds perfectly darling.

135
00:14:07,687 --> 00:14:12,238
I hope he loves you as much as

136
00:14:12,847 --> 00:14:14,758
you love him.

137
00:14:26,647 --> 00:14:31,402
As much as l love you, my darling.

138
00:14:43,807 --> 00:14:45,286
Oscar, where have you been?

139
00:14:45,447 --> 00:14:48,883
You shouldn't keep me waiting
when l'm expecting a letter.

140
00:14:50,207 --> 00:14:52,721
Why, Oscar. Where's your uniform?

141
00:14:54,287 --> 00:14:57,006
Oscar, what's happened?

142
00:14:58,447 --> 00:15:01,041
You haven't lost your job?

143
00:15:01,927 --> 00:15:04,964
You shouldn't fool me like this.

144
00:15:05,527 --> 00:15:07,199
They can't fire you!

145
00:15:07,367 --> 00:15:09,597
They can't, eh?
Well, they did.

146
00:15:09,767 --> 00:15:11,644
They caught me putting
your letter in my pocket.

147
00:15:11,807 --> 00:15:13,160
Where's my letter?

148
00:15:13,327 --> 00:15:15,363
What am l going to tell the wife?
That's what l want to know.

149
00:15:15,527 --> 00:15:18,564
- Where's my letter?
- How do l know? They took it.

150
00:15:20,767 --> 00:15:23,600
Annie, where you going?
They won't let you in that way.

151
00:15:24,607 --> 00:15:26,437
Hey! Hey!

152
00:15:28,687 --> 00:15:30,200
You must be
in the wrong place, madam.

153
00:15:30,367 --> 00:15:32,562
- Peasants aren't allowed in here.
- There's a strict rule about...

154
00:15:32,727 --> 00:15:34,445
Let me go, let me go!

155
00:15:44,047 --> 00:15:45,162
I beg your pardon.

156
00:15:46,367 --> 00:15:47,766
Oh, my goodness.

157
00:15:47,767 --> 00:15:50,281
There's some mail here
for me, a letter.

158
00:15:50,447 --> 00:15:52,085
Mail?
Are you stopping here, Madam?

159
00:15:52,607 --> 00:15:56,361
No, but there's a letter.
It came this morning for me.

160
00:15:56,567 --> 00:15:58,683
It's from Barcelona, Spain.

161
00:15:59,327 --> 00:16:00,999
It's very important.

162
00:16:05,167 --> 00:16:06,441
Well, what is your name, please?

163
00:16:06,607 --> 00:16:09,519
Mrs. E. Worthington Manville.

164
00:16:09,847 --> 00:16:12,919
- Mrs. E. Worthington Manville?
- Yes.

165
00:16:13,767 --> 00:16:15,917
Mrs. E. Worthington Manville.

166
00:16:38,687 --> 00:16:41,440
I'm the manager.
Anything l can do for you?

167
00:16:41,607 --> 00:16:42,801
Yes, if you please.

168
00:16:42,967 --> 00:16:45,561
There's a letter here for me
and l'd like to get it.

169
00:16:45,727 --> 00:16:47,638
Letter?
Addressed to the hotel?

170
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:49,525
Yes...

171
00:16:50,207 --> 00:16:52,118
l told that other man
all about it.

172
00:16:52,687 --> 00:16:56,282
- You're not a guest of the hotel?
- No, anybody can see that!

173
00:16:56,447 --> 00:16:58,915
Please, no need for shouting.

174
00:16:59,087 --> 00:17:00,964
Then why don't you
give me my letter?

175
00:17:01,127 --> 00:17:04,039
What's the use of
asking me foolish questions?

176
00:17:04,207 --> 00:17:06,596
I'm afraid l have to ask you
to leave the hotel.

177
00:17:06,767 --> 00:17:09,520
Well, l won't go
till l get my letter!

178
00:17:10,087 --> 00:17:11,566
I'll be compelled to
call the police.

179
00:17:11,727 --> 00:17:14,560
Well, call the police.
Call anybody you like.

180
00:17:14,727 --> 00:17:18,003
I'm not a criminal.
I haven't done anything wrong.

181
00:17:18,407 --> 00:17:20,602
Mister, please.

182
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:24,119
I don't want trouble for the hotel.

183
00:17:24,287 --> 00:17:29,202
All l want is my letter.
It's from my daughter, see?

184
00:17:29,687 --> 00:17:32,281
It came all the way from Spain.

185
00:17:34,127 --> 00:17:35,196
Just a moment.

186
00:17:36,167 --> 00:17:37,646
- Iloyd.
- Yes, sir?

187
00:17:38,847 --> 00:17:40,724
Do you remember
a letter addressed to Mrs...?

188
00:17:40,887 --> 00:17:42,115
E. Worthington Manville

189
00:17:42,967 --> 00:17:44,002
Yes, it came in this morning.

190
00:17:44,167 --> 00:17:46,522
There, you see?
I told you it was here.

191
00:17:46,687 --> 00:17:48,126
Let her have it.

192
00:17:48,127 --> 00:17:50,561
God bless you kindly, sir.
God bless you.

193
00:17:50,727 --> 00:17:52,638
Why are you standing there?
Go get it.

194
00:17:52,927 --> 00:17:54,206
I sent it back.

195
00:17:54,207 --> 00:17:55,446
You sent it back?

196
00:17:55,447 --> 00:17:57,677
Sir, there's no one registered
here under that name,

197
00:17:57,847 --> 00:18:00,520
so l sent it back marked
"party not known here".

198
00:18:00,847 --> 00:18:05,125
But you can't. She'll find out
that l'm not living here.

199
00:18:05,287 --> 00:18:07,847
- Don't you see?
- Please, please.

200
00:18:08,927 --> 00:18:10,155
Has the mail left yet?

201
00:18:10,327 --> 00:18:12,158
Yes, the boy took it out
a few minutes ago.

202
00:18:12,327 --> 00:18:13,362
It's probably...

203
00:18:13,487 --> 00:18:14,715
There he is now.

204
00:18:16,807 --> 00:18:18,923
- Hey, boy, boy!
- Please.

205
00:18:19,447 --> 00:18:22,723
Don't put any more in there!
Don't put any more...

206
00:18:24,207 --> 00:18:25,481
You can't do this here.

207
00:18:26,447 --> 00:18:27,596
She's quite crazy.

208
00:18:29,087 --> 00:18:32,716
There it is.
I knew it was here.

209
00:18:34,607 --> 00:18:36,404
I'd know it any place.

210
00:18:36,567 --> 00:18:38,683
Leave this hotel at once.

211
00:18:40,127 --> 00:18:44,006
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.

212
00:20:00,447 --> 00:20:01,766
She's fainted.

213
00:20:02,487 --> 00:20:03,522
It's an old lady.

214
00:20:04,047 --> 00:20:05,275
Come on, grandma.

215
00:20:12,767 --> 00:20:13,961
You all right now, mother?

216
00:20:14,687 --> 00:20:15,915
I'm...

217
00:20:18,107 --> 00:20:19,301
Where's my letter?

218
00:20:19,467 --> 00:20:21,344
Where's my letter?

219
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:24,421
- Here.
- There you are.

220
00:20:26,467 --> 00:20:29,186
- Do you feel alright?
- Now leave me alone.

221
00:20:29,347 --> 00:20:30,666
I'm all right.

222
00:20:31,187 --> 00:20:33,303
Nothing's the matter with me.
I'm all right.

223
00:20:42,907 --> 00:20:44,818
So, if my daughter comes here,

224
00:20:45,547 --> 00:20:47,936
all you gotta do is
say that l'm dead.

225
00:20:48,227 --> 00:20:50,024
That ought to be easy enough?

226
00:20:50,187 --> 00:20:53,736
It won't do the hotel any harm.

227
00:20:54,507 --> 00:20:57,943
"Mrs. E. Worthington Manville
passed away last week."

228
00:20:58,107 --> 00:20:59,825
That's simple enough.

229
00:21:00,227 --> 00:21:03,537
Oh, yes. Say there was
a funeral, a big funeral,

230
00:21:03,707 --> 00:21:05,663
and lots of flowers,

231
00:21:06,227 --> 00:21:08,024
and all the
prominent people came.

232
00:21:08,507 --> 00:21:11,226
If they ask about Mr. Manville,

233
00:21:11,387 --> 00:21:13,742
just say he was so broken up

234
00:21:14,387 --> 00:21:17,265
he had to take a trip
around the world for a year.

235
00:21:17,747 --> 00:21:20,466
Make it two years.
That'll do the trick.

236
00:21:20,827 --> 00:21:22,545
Pretty slick, isn't it?

237
00:21:22,947 --> 00:21:23,982
It's Apple Annie.

238
00:21:24,747 --> 00:21:26,499
- Come on, Annie.
- Will you do it for me?

239
00:21:26,667 --> 00:21:28,578
- I won't bother you any more.
- Take her out of here.

240
00:21:28,747 --> 00:21:31,978
- Come on, Annie.
- I won't... you've got to.

241
00:21:32,507 --> 00:21:34,941
- You can't let me...
- Come on, never mind.

242
00:21:35,107 --> 00:21:37,575
You've gotta! You've gotta!

243
00:21:39,067 --> 00:21:42,662
Sure, we can talk business
if the proposition's right.

244
00:21:43,187 --> 00:21:46,065
No, we want the whole stable,
every horse in it.

245
00:21:46,867 --> 00:21:48,141
Look, three sixes.

246
00:21:48,587 --> 00:21:51,147
Listen, Babcock without
Sun Count or Beau Geste,

247
00:21:51,307 --> 00:21:53,901
we wouldn't give you counterfeit
script for the whole outfit.

248
00:21:54,067 --> 00:21:56,023
Okay, how much you want?

249
00:21:56,307 --> 00:21:57,946
What?

250
00:21:57,947 --> 00:22:00,177
He'd take a hundred grand.
It's a steal.

251
00:22:01,027 --> 00:22:02,506
A hundred thousand?

252
00:22:02,867 --> 00:22:05,939
What do you boys expect us
to do, rob the Mint?

253
00:22:06,827 --> 00:22:09,944
Okay, if l can line up the Dude,
we'll step around and see ya.

254
00:22:12,987 --> 00:22:15,865
It's a pushover, Dude.
Babcock must need the money.

255
00:22:16,027 --> 00:22:18,063
Take it from me, you're lucky.

256
00:22:18,227 --> 00:22:21,105
Which of these vests do you like,
the white or the striped?

257
00:22:21,267 --> 00:22:24,623
Let's get going. We can knock
this deal over in an hour.

258
00:22:25,627 --> 00:22:27,743
I can't find her, Boss.
Can't find her no place.

259
00:22:27,907 --> 00:22:29,420
- Can't find who?
- Apple Annie.

260
00:22:29,587 --> 00:22:32,147
I looked high and low for her.
She ain't nowheres around.

261
00:22:32,307 --> 00:22:34,298
That's why you were stalling.

262
00:22:34,467 --> 00:22:36,344
What do you mean,
"couldn't find her"?

263
00:22:36,947 --> 00:22:39,017
I get a lot of help
from you guys.

264
00:22:39,467 --> 00:22:42,539
I feed you pretty good.
You got dough in your pockets.

265
00:22:42,907 --> 00:22:45,740
Listen. I know what l'm doing
and l don't go into this deal

266
00:22:45,907 --> 00:22:47,704
till l get an apple from Annie.

267
00:22:49,547 --> 00:22:51,936
Listen 'stupe',
all you had to do

268
00:22:52,107 --> 00:22:54,337
was ask any panhandler
on Broadway.

269
00:22:54,507 --> 00:22:57,863
That's just it, there ain't no
panhandlers on Broadway.

270
00:22:58,027 --> 00:22:59,066
What?

271
00:22:59,067 --> 00:23:01,820
Listen, l hope my mother croaks
if this ain't the truth.

272
00:23:02,067 --> 00:23:05,377
I walked over town for hours.
Ain't a beggar on the streets.

273
00:23:05,547 --> 00:23:08,300
I suppose they're all
in Europe on vacation.

274
00:23:08,467 --> 00:23:11,982
Search me. It's got me scared.
Broadway looks like a morgue.

275
00:23:12,987 --> 00:23:15,421
Blind man here.
His name is Shorty.

276
00:23:15,587 --> 00:23:17,384
- Shorty? A blind man?
- Yes.

277
00:23:17,907 --> 00:23:19,266
Bring him in.

278
00:23:19,267 --> 00:23:20,586
None of them around, eh?

279
00:23:20,747 --> 00:23:23,136
Get that dizzy dame off your mind.

280
00:23:23,427 --> 00:23:25,622
I don't think about her
in the daytime.

281
00:23:27,787 --> 00:23:28,586
Let 'em in.

282
00:23:28,587 --> 00:23:29,702
- Hello, Dude.
- Hello.

283
00:23:30,787 --> 00:23:32,982
- What do you mugs want?
- It's about Annie.

284
00:23:33,227 --> 00:23:35,138
What about Annie? I've been
looking all over town for her.

285
00:23:35,307 --> 00:23:36,376
She's in an awful jam.

286
00:23:36,547 --> 00:23:38,458
- Been drinkin' again, huh?
- No, it ain't that.

287
00:23:38,627 --> 00:23:40,458
Notterhead found her
walking by the water.

288
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:42,106
Yeah, she was in a daze.

289
00:23:42,267 --> 00:23:45,020
She was walking down the
waterfront, talking to herself.

290
00:23:45,187 --> 00:23:46,825
Good thing Notterhead
ran into her.

291
00:23:46,987 --> 00:23:48,340
What is all this?

292
00:23:48,507 --> 00:23:51,260
- She's in an awful jam.
- I heard that.

293
00:23:53,387 --> 00:23:56,220
For years she's been swiping
stationary from the Marberry.

294
00:23:56,387 --> 00:23:58,537
And writing her daughter
she's in high society.

295
00:23:58,747 --> 00:24:01,307
- Daughter?
- She's got a daughter in Europe.

296
00:24:01,467 --> 00:24:02,695
Been in a convent
ever since she was a baby.

297
00:24:02,867 --> 00:24:04,266
Sends her money every month.

298
00:24:04,427 --> 00:24:06,418
Now she's gonna marry
a Count or something.

299
00:24:06,627 --> 00:24:10,176
What is all this, a racket?
Anybody know where she lives?

300
00:24:10,347 --> 00:24:13,180
- First Avenue, 314.
- Remember that. I'm going there.

301
00:24:13,987 --> 00:24:15,545
Okay, you mugs. Out of here!

302
00:24:15,907 --> 00:24:17,738
Come on, you heard.

303
00:24:17,907 --> 00:24:20,705
Happy, go to Babcock's
and stall him till l get there.

304
00:24:20,867 --> 00:24:22,585
Shakespeare, come along with me.

305
00:24:23,027 --> 00:24:25,257
As soon as l get my apple
l'll meet you over there.

306
00:24:41,587 --> 00:24:44,226
As l live and breathe,

307
00:24:44,387 --> 00:24:46,582
my old friend, the Dude.

308
00:24:46,747 --> 00:24:48,385
Come in, gentlemen.

309
00:24:48,747 --> 00:24:52,581
I thought so. On the gin again.
Where's your apples?

310
00:24:52,987 --> 00:24:56,457
Come on in.
The butler will take your things.

311
00:24:57,707 --> 00:25:00,301
You didn't know l had
a butler, did you, Dude?

312
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:01,816
I've got lots of butlers,

313
00:25:02,987 --> 00:25:04,146
millions of 'em.

314
00:25:04,147 --> 00:25:06,615
Where you been, you old buzzard?
I've looked all day for you.

315
00:25:07,147 --> 00:25:10,537
So good of you to come down
for the hunting season.

316
00:25:11,787 --> 00:25:15,257
Everyone always comes down
for the hunting season.

317
00:25:15,827 --> 00:25:18,022
Dude, let's get out of here.
When she's crocked,

318
00:25:18,187 --> 00:25:21,338
she pulls this 'society' stuff.
Gives me the creeps.

319
00:25:21,507 --> 00:25:23,145
You trying to kill yourself?

320
00:25:23,307 --> 00:25:26,299
You know what Doc Michel said.
This stuff'll poison you.

321
00:25:26,467 --> 00:25:28,537
Hey, Boss.

322
00:25:28,787 --> 00:25:31,255
This must be the daughter
them panhandlers was yappin' about.

323
00:25:31,987 --> 00:25:34,342
You haven't met my daughter,
have you?

324
00:25:35,147 --> 00:25:37,342
She's coming over to visit me.

325
00:25:38,667 --> 00:25:40,146
Isn't she lovely?

326
00:25:41,427 --> 00:25:43,622
She's coming over here...

327
00:25:43,987 --> 00:25:45,261
with a Count.

328
00:25:46,267 --> 00:25:48,906
She's gonna marry
the Count's son.

329
00:25:49,667 --> 00:25:52,943
That's the kind of people
l associate with.

330
00:25:54,827 --> 00:25:56,545
Funny, isn't it?

331
00:25:57,907 --> 00:26:00,944
She thinks l'm in high society.

332
00:26:03,107 --> 00:26:05,337
Wait till she sees me!

333
00:26:06,747 --> 00:26:09,386
It's going to be funny
when she finds out

334
00:26:09,547 --> 00:26:11,856
her mother is Apple Annie.

335
00:26:13,747 --> 00:26:15,863
Why don't you laugh?

336
00:26:16,747 --> 00:26:18,419
Why don't you laugh?

337
00:26:19,187 --> 00:26:20,984
It's funny, l tell you.

338
00:26:21,427 --> 00:26:24,339
Apple Annie,
from Schubert Alley.

339
00:26:28,827 --> 00:26:30,306
Apple Annie...

340
00:26:31,987 --> 00:26:33,500
from Schubert Alley.

341
00:26:42,147 --> 00:26:44,900
Old fool, getting herself
in a jam like that.

342
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:53,501
Remind me to send
Doc Michel down here.

343
00:26:57,027 --> 00:26:59,825
- What you gonna do, Mr. Dude?
- Do about what?

344
00:26:59,987 --> 00:27:01,261
About Annie.

345
00:27:01,427 --> 00:27:02,906
What do you mugs want me to do?

346
00:27:03,067 --> 00:27:04,785
We thought you'd figure it out.

347
00:27:04,947 --> 00:27:07,586
We had a meeting and someone said:
"Ask the Dude."

348
00:27:07,747 --> 00:27:11,023
That's all l got to do?
Go on, beat it.

349
00:27:11,187 --> 00:27:14,657
If Annie could get an apartment
at the Marberry for a week...

350
00:27:14,827 --> 00:27:17,500
- We'd pitch in for some of it.
- Yeah, we'd all help.

351
00:27:17,667 --> 00:27:20,227
- Annie at the Marberry?
- Yeah.

352
00:27:20,387 --> 00:27:21,422
Go on, get out of here.

353
00:27:22,387 --> 00:27:24,696
- Come one.
- Come on, scram everybody.

354
00:27:30,347 --> 00:27:33,703
The nerve of those guys.
Annie at the Marberry.

355
00:27:35,547 --> 00:27:38,015
Hey Dude,
mind if l have an idea?

356
00:27:38,187 --> 00:27:39,426
Yeah.

357
00:27:39,427 --> 00:27:42,544
This here society friend
of yours, Rodney Kent,

358
00:27:42,707 --> 00:27:43,981
he's got an apartment
at the Marberry.

359
00:27:44,147 --> 00:27:45,899
What about it? What about it?

360
00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:49,665
Can you see me asking Rodney Kent
"Lend me your apartment

361
00:27:49,827 --> 00:27:51,101
for Apple Annie?"

362
00:27:51,267 --> 00:27:53,144
He'd throw me out
on my rear.

363
00:27:53,907 --> 00:27:56,341
I was just gonna say that.
"He'd throw you out on your rear."

364
00:27:56,507 --> 00:27:58,941
- Shut up about it, then.
- I was just gonna do that.

365
00:28:16,947 --> 00:28:19,825
- Where have l seen you before?
- Whom do you wish to see, sir?

366
00:28:19,987 --> 00:28:23,218
- Is this Rodney Kent's apartment?
- Yes, sir, but he's away.

367
00:28:23,387 --> 00:28:25,981
What gave you the idea
l give a hang where he is?

368
00:28:26,147 --> 00:28:27,546
Well, l assume...

369
00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:30,665
Don't assume so much.
It'll get you into trouble.

370
00:28:30,827 --> 00:28:32,465
- Yes, sir.
- Come here a minute.

371
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:35,937
I'll tell you something that will
upset the rest of your day.

372
00:28:36,107 --> 00:28:38,905
- I don't care about Rodney Kent.
- No, sir.

373
00:28:39,067 --> 00:28:42,742
Toddle in there and tell
Dave the Dude l wanna see him.

374
00:28:43,147 --> 00:28:44,785
- He is in there, isn't he?
- Yes, sir.

375
00:28:45,027 --> 00:28:46,221
Who should l say is calling?

376
00:28:46,387 --> 00:28:49,060
Happy McGuire, apple of his eye,
that's who.

377
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:51,616
- You got that straight?
- Yes, sir. I have it.

378
00:28:51,787 --> 00:28:54,904
Don't let it upset you.
Four out of five have it.

379
00:28:57,787 --> 00:29:00,176
I promise not to get depressed.

380
00:29:07,107 --> 00:29:10,144
And remember,
if you take one drop of gin...

381
00:29:12,987 --> 00:29:14,659
Now, here's the layout.

382
00:29:15,907 --> 00:29:18,865
Here's your bedroom, see?
That's over in the corner.

383
00:29:19,827 --> 00:29:22,819
The Count is here, the son here,
your daughter's here.

384
00:29:23,147 --> 00:29:24,466
Now, you got that straight?

385
00:29:25,227 --> 00:29:26,740
Here, you better keep this.

386
00:29:30,107 --> 00:29:32,382
Fine mess
you got everybody into.

387
00:29:32,547 --> 00:29:34,458
Everybody worrying about you.

388
00:29:35,307 --> 00:29:37,867
Why didn't you swipe stationary
out of the White House?

389
00:29:38,027 --> 00:29:40,222
Then you could've said
you were the President's wife.

390
00:29:41,027 --> 00:29:44,258
- Mr. Happy McGuire.
- 'The boy with the sore feet."

391
00:29:45,107 --> 00:29:47,985
You know l've been looking
for you for two days?

392
00:29:49,307 --> 00:29:50,506
What's this?

393
00:29:50,507 --> 00:29:52,862
Meet the new society lady.

394
00:29:54,107 --> 00:29:57,144
Hotel Marberry, daughter.

395
00:29:58,147 --> 00:30:00,217
Where'd you ever get
a daughter, anyway?

396
00:30:01,107 --> 00:30:02,460
Who's the father?

397
00:30:02,947 --> 00:30:04,380
Who's the father?

398
00:30:04,907 --> 00:30:07,740
I suppose you'll tell me
he was a big shot or something.

399
00:30:07,907 --> 00:30:10,182
Rodney Kent gave you
this apartment for her?

400
00:30:10,547 --> 00:30:13,459
Yeah, must be
as big a sucker as l am.

401
00:30:13,627 --> 00:30:15,299
He must be off his nut.

402
00:30:15,467 --> 00:30:18,220
"The whole thing sounds insane,
but go ahead, use the apartment.

403
00:30:18,387 --> 00:30:21,459
My only request is
make certain

404
00:30:21,627 --> 00:30:24,266
no one puts mustaches
on the paintings."

405
00:30:25,227 --> 00:30:28,344
Say, listen,
come over here.

406
00:30:28,507 --> 00:30:29,826
I want to talk to you.

407
00:30:32,027 --> 00:30:36,339
Get this, l got the Babcock deal
all set, get me? It's set.

408
00:30:36,907 --> 00:30:39,216
Now that's our bread and butter.
What's this?

409
00:30:39,827 --> 00:30:41,306
You're not doing yourself
any good here.

410
00:30:41,467 --> 00:30:43,617
Yeah, l know.
You think l'm screwy,

411
00:30:43,787 --> 00:30:45,106
but l got an idea.

412
00:30:45,947 --> 00:30:48,142
For years Annie's
been lucky to me, ain't she?

413
00:30:48,587 --> 00:30:51,977
What luck would l have
if l passed her up now?

414
00:30:52,747 --> 00:30:54,226
Miss Missouri Martin.

415
00:30:54,387 --> 00:30:56,105
- Fetch her in.
- Missouri Martin?

416
00:30:56,267 --> 00:30:58,735
Yeah, the old gal herself.
How is it, boys?

417
00:30:59,067 --> 00:31:01,023
Come on, gang.
How's my baby?

418
00:31:01,187 --> 00:31:02,506
Cut it out, cut it out.

419
00:31:02,667 --> 00:31:05,977
Here they are, suckers, the gang
that keeps me broke but beautiful.

420
00:31:06,547 --> 00:31:08,856
All ready for the slaughter.
Now where's the victim?

421
00:31:10,067 --> 00:31:11,420
There she is.

422
00:31:11,587 --> 00:31:14,465
And what material for
a bunch of hungry artists.

423
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,425
Look at 'em, tongues hanging out.

424
00:31:17,587 --> 00:31:19,543
By the time they're finished,
she'll look as good as me.

425
00:31:19,707 --> 00:31:21,857
The idea is to
make her look like a lady.

426
00:31:23,387 --> 00:31:24,900
"Laughing Boy" is in again.

427
00:31:25,147 --> 00:31:27,536
All right, flesh pounders,
this is going to be a sweet job.

428
00:31:28,187 --> 00:31:31,418
- Alright, Annie, let's go.
- We will make you beautiful.

429
00:31:31,587 --> 00:31:33,259
- Come on.
- 'Atta gal.'

430
00:31:33,427 --> 00:31:35,258
The hair the biggest problem.

431
00:31:35,427 --> 00:31:37,065
It's all right, Annie.

432
00:31:39,027 --> 00:31:42,622
You won't get to first base.
You'll have lead her on a string.

433
00:31:42,787 --> 00:31:44,425
Take her in that bedroom.

434
00:31:47,627 --> 00:31:49,822
Wait a minute,
he can't go in there.

435
00:31:49,987 --> 00:31:53,377
It's alright, Dude,
it's alright.

436
00:32:01,027 --> 00:32:02,062
<i>Pierre.</i>

437
00:32:13,307 --> 00:32:14,899
Alright, girls, that's all.

438
00:32:16,027 --> 00:32:18,336
Folks, meet
Mrs. E. Worthington Manville.

439
00:32:42,987 --> 00:32:45,581
I'll never forget you for this.

440
00:32:46,827 --> 00:32:48,465
God bless you.

441
00:32:48,627 --> 00:32:50,140
Okay, okay.

442
00:32:50,507 --> 00:32:53,101
Yeah, you look fine.
You'd fool anybody.

443
00:32:53,987 --> 00:32:55,215
Nice work, Missouri.

444
00:32:57,467 --> 00:32:59,377
Come on, Happy. Let's get going.

445
00:33:03,067 --> 00:33:04,546
Wait a minute, you guys.

446
00:33:04,707 --> 00:33:06,345
Where do you think you're going?

447
00:33:06,507 --> 00:33:08,737
We're returning to the business
of making a living,

448
00:33:08,907 --> 00:33:12,058
- if it's just the same to you.
- You think you're through?

449
00:33:12,347 --> 00:33:14,463
- What about the husband?
- Husband?

450
00:33:14,627 --> 00:33:17,300
Worthington Manville,
Who's gonna dig him up?

451
00:33:17,467 --> 00:33:19,378
I forgot all about the husband.

452
00:33:19,907 --> 00:33:22,819
Missouri, go back in and tell her
to take care of that herself.

453
00:33:22,987 --> 00:33:24,215
That's a brilliant idea.

454
00:33:24,467 --> 00:33:26,423
Who's she gonna get,
one of her panhandler friends.?

455
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:28,737
He got her the apartment
and a flock of clothes.

456
00:33:28,907 --> 00:33:30,101
What more do you want?

457
00:33:30,507 --> 00:33:32,543
- You can take care of it.
- Oh, l can, can l?

458
00:33:32,707 --> 00:33:35,779
Very sweet of you.
Whose idea was this, anyway?

459
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:38,939
I'm a kibbutzer in this,
now you want to give it me?

460
00:33:39,107 --> 00:33:40,586
You got another guess coming!

461
00:33:41,147 --> 00:33:43,024
I like Annie
as much as anybody,

462
00:33:43,427 --> 00:33:46,100
but if you guys are
running out, l'm going too.

463
00:33:47,147 --> 00:33:49,058
I'm a sucker if l'm gonna be
left holding the bag.

464
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:50,626
You want the Dude
to give up his business?

465
00:33:50,787 --> 00:33:52,345
I got a night club
needs looking after.

466
00:33:52,507 --> 00:33:55,465
That comical hole in the wall?
Don't make me laugh.

467
00:33:55,627 --> 00:33:57,106
If l could make you laugh,
l'd go out and get drunk!

468
00:33:57,267 --> 00:33:59,019
You couldn't make a hyena laugh.

469
00:33:59,187 --> 00:34:02,020
Wait a minute, what do you mean,
talking to her like that?

470
00:34:02,747 --> 00:34:03,975
Stop arguing
and let's do something.

471
00:34:04,147 --> 00:34:07,059
If we gotta dig up a husband,
let's get it over with.

472
00:34:07,227 --> 00:34:09,821
Now you gotta dig up
a husband for her.

473
00:34:09,987 --> 00:34:12,899
Where you gonna get
a husband, just like that?

474
00:34:14,947 --> 00:34:16,460
What about you, Happy?

475
00:34:16,747 --> 00:34:17,506
Me?

476
00:34:17,507 --> 00:34:20,146
That's a swell idea.
I think you'd be just precious.

477
00:34:20,307 --> 00:34:23,299
Wonderful idea.
Just one thing stands in the way.

478
00:34:23,467 --> 00:34:26,459
I got a wife
that's very fussy.

479
00:34:26,907 --> 00:34:29,865
She don't like for me to
go around marrying people.

480
00:34:30,907 --> 00:34:33,626
I know how unreasonable
that must sound to you,

481
00:34:33,787 --> 00:34:36,381
but she's funny that way.

482
00:34:49,467 --> 00:34:50,536
No.

483
00:34:54,387 --> 00:34:57,459
I got just the one!
Judge Henry G. Blake.

484
00:34:57,627 --> 00:34:58,426
Who's he?

485
00:34:58,427 --> 00:35:01,464
For a proposition like this,
we need a guy that talks classy.

486
00:35:01,627 --> 00:35:04,221
Well, judge Blake is
the classiest talker in town.

487
00:35:04,387 --> 00:35:05,945
- Shakespeare.
- Yes, Boss.

488
00:35:10,107 --> 00:35:12,575
Judge Blake, the guy that
told you you could shoot pool

489
00:35:12,747 --> 00:35:14,305
is taking you for a sleigh ride.

490
00:35:14,667 --> 00:35:16,339
Granted, my boy, granted.

491
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:21,346
In Providence, where l come from,

492
00:35:21,507 --> 00:35:24,101
a cripple like you would be
taken for all he's got.

493
00:35:24,267 --> 00:35:26,701
That's one of the reasons
l never go to Providence.

494
00:35:27,067 --> 00:35:29,820
If you did, you'd come back
without your pants.

495
00:35:31,787 --> 00:35:34,984
How much longer must l toy with
this be-knighted son of Providence?

496
00:35:35,587 --> 00:35:37,100
Take it easy, judge.
This guy's a cinch.

497
00:35:37,267 --> 00:35:39,144
Any minute now he'll want to
jack up the ante.

498
00:35:39,307 --> 00:35:41,218
I'm becoming annoyed at
this silly twaddle.

499
00:35:41,507 --> 00:35:45,022
If the sap knew who
the judge was, he'd go home.

500
00:35:45,827 --> 00:35:49,456
If the stakes were higher,
you might do better.

501
00:35:49,787 --> 00:35:51,220
Success at last.

502
00:35:51,507 --> 00:35:53,498
Do better?
I doubt it, my friend.

503
00:35:54,347 --> 00:35:56,417
Thought you might want to
double the bet.

504
00:35:57,027 --> 00:35:58,540
How about 10 cents a ball?

505
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:00,943
10 cents? A veritable fortune.

506
00:36:01,387 --> 00:36:03,378
Afraid, huh?

507
00:36:03,907 --> 00:36:07,456
Afraid? Nobody ever said that
to me and got away with it!

508
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:10,585
Did you know that during the
reign of King Charles 2nd,

509
00:36:10,747 --> 00:36:12,817
we were known as
"The Fearless Blakes"?

510
00:36:13,067 --> 00:36:15,058
I'll show you how afraid l am!

511
00:36:15,267 --> 00:36:17,178
I'll make it 50 cents a ball!

512
00:36:17,427 --> 00:36:18,746
Okay, come on!

513
00:36:18,907 --> 00:36:21,182
- Boy, rack 'em up!
- Yes, sir.

514
00:36:21,667 --> 00:36:23,417
Come on.

515
00:36:24,747 --> 00:36:26,305
Set 'em up.

516
00:36:26,707 --> 00:36:28,423
Let's get goin'.

517
00:36:31,387 --> 00:36:32,386
Judge.

518
00:36:32,387 --> 00:36:34,776
My old friend,
the Bard of Avon.

519
00:36:35,627 --> 00:36:38,425
- Dude wants to see you right away.
- Can't be done, my friend.

520
00:36:38,587 --> 00:36:41,260
I am engaged in
a very profitable enterprise.

521
00:36:41,507 --> 00:36:42,906
I don't know nothing about that.

522
00:36:43,067 --> 00:36:45,786
In fact, my next month's
room rent depends on it.

523
00:36:46,027 --> 00:36:47,858
Come on, judge.
It's your shot.

524
00:36:48,147 --> 00:36:50,820
Wait, the Dude said not to
take no for an answer.

525
00:36:51,147 --> 00:36:53,866
- You know what that means.
- Yes, l've had occasion.

526
00:36:54,267 --> 00:36:56,576
What's the matter, judge?
Getting cold feet?

527
00:36:56,827 --> 00:37:00,456
There he is, the lucky stiff.
I'll probably lose him for life.

528
00:37:00,987 --> 00:37:03,137
- Excuse me.
- Step on it, judge.

529
00:37:03,307 --> 00:37:04,456
Guys, you're holding up the game.

530
00:37:04,627 --> 00:37:07,061
I thought you were known as
"The Fearless Blakes"?

531
00:37:07,467 --> 00:37:10,379
You were born under
a lucky star, my friend.

532
00:37:20,907 --> 00:37:24,786
A 6 ball shot, friends, one in
each pocket, shooting left-handed.

533
00:37:24,947 --> 00:37:26,626
Amazing.

534
00:37:26,627 --> 00:37:28,298
Quiet, boys!

535
00:37:30,827 --> 00:37:32,623
Great shot!

536
00:37:35,107 --> 00:37:36,699
- Collect from Providence.
- Right.

537
00:37:36,867 --> 00:37:38,903
That was some shot.

538
00:37:40,227 --> 00:37:41,819
And with the left hand.

539
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:45,587
Thank you, me lad.
Proceed, Shakespeare.

540
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:48,065
It's only for a week, judge.

541
00:37:48,227 --> 00:37:51,742
All you do is be her
rich, aristocratic husband.

542
00:37:52,147 --> 00:37:54,103
The rich and aristocratic
suits me admirably.

543
00:37:54,267 --> 00:37:56,622
- Ever try being a husband?
- I'm notorious for it.

544
00:37:56,787 --> 00:37:58,937
- How'd you make out.
- Pitifully, pitifully.

545
00:37:59,787 --> 00:38:01,823
They were charming women, too.
All four of them.

546
00:38:03,107 --> 00:38:04,938
I'm sorry you brought that up.

547
00:38:05,187 --> 00:38:07,860
I can't understand why l should
prove such a miserable failure.

548
00:38:08,267 --> 00:38:10,064
You probably talked them to death.

549
00:38:14,467 --> 00:38:16,344
- What do you say?
- I'm interested.

550
00:38:16,507 --> 00:38:18,304
- Whose husband?
- Never mind that.

551
00:38:18,547 --> 00:38:21,425
Now here's the layout.

552
00:38:23,377 --> 00:38:26,096
You're going to be
the ever-lovin' husband

553
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:27,486
of Apple Annie.

554
00:38:29,847 --> 00:38:32,281
Preposterous!
Most preposterous!

555
00:38:32,567 --> 00:38:34,364
Of all people, Apple Annie.

556
00:38:34,727 --> 00:38:37,719
Listen, Dude, this is
asking much too much.

557
00:38:38,687 --> 00:38:40,803
A mere apple vendor,
practically a mendicant.

558
00:38:42,367 --> 00:38:44,881
- Good afternoon.
- Here she is now.

559
00:38:46,687 --> 00:38:48,359
- Here who is?
- Apple Annie.

560
00:38:49,767 --> 00:38:52,918
The judge was saying how glad
he was to be your husband.

561
00:38:53,447 --> 00:38:54,766
Thank you.

562
00:38:59,987 --> 00:39:01,625
Thank you so much.

563
00:39:01,787 --> 00:39:03,982
I am deeply flattered.

564
00:39:04,147 --> 00:39:07,935
The pleasure, l assure you,
my dear and charming lady,

565
00:39:08,187 --> 00:39:10,064
is all mine.

566
00:39:22,327 --> 00:39:23,919
19 and a half.

567
00:39:24,127 --> 00:39:25,446
See, Happy?

568
00:39:25,607 --> 00:39:29,566
An apartment, clothes, judge Blake
and the thing was cinched.

569
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:33,476
Just between you and me,
l got quite a bang out of it.

570
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:36,260
Well, maybe now that that's over,

571
00:39:36,427 --> 00:39:38,987
we can revive the Babcock deal.

572
00:39:39,947 --> 00:39:43,576
'Revive it'?
You mean, you let it get away?

573
00:39:44,587 --> 00:39:46,703
I let it get away?

574
00:39:46,867 --> 00:39:50,098
You laid down on the job, huh?
I should've known that.

575
00:39:50,787 --> 00:39:51,981
Say, listen,

576
00:39:53,787 --> 00:39:56,585
Babcock wore out the seats
of two pairs of pants

577
00:39:56,747 --> 00:39:58,863
sitting on his "El Fideldo".

578
00:39:59,027 --> 00:40:01,097
All right, all right.
Call him up.

579
00:40:01,967 --> 00:40:04,037
Tell him l'm ready.
I'll come right over.

580
00:40:04,207 --> 00:40:07,005
I let it get away!

581
00:40:14,047 --> 00:40:15,275
Hello, Dude.

582
00:40:16,367 --> 00:40:19,518
- I'm glad l found you in.
- What do you want?

583
00:40:19,687 --> 00:40:22,076
I want to see you
before the boat got in.

584
00:40:22,327 --> 00:40:24,602
Annie's daughter arrives today.

585
00:40:24,767 --> 00:40:25,882
Yeah, l know.

586
00:40:26,047 --> 00:40:28,083
Alright, men, scram.
I'll see you tomorrow.

587
00:40:28,247 --> 00:40:31,603
I shouldn't hurry so.
It plays havoc with my dignity.

588
00:40:32,207 --> 00:40:35,085
What's on your mind, judge?
Come on, l got business...

589
00:40:35,247 --> 00:40:37,602
Dude, you played
an abominable trick

590
00:40:37,767 --> 00:40:39,485
on that poor old woman.

591
00:40:39,647 --> 00:40:40,766
I what?

592
00:40:40,767 --> 00:40:42,166
My dear Dude,

593
00:40:42,327 --> 00:40:45,125
do you know the number
of reporters

594
00:40:45,287 --> 00:40:47,801
- that meet the incoming boats?
- Well?

595
00:40:48,287 --> 00:40:50,437
They'll want to know
all about the Count,

596
00:40:50,607 --> 00:40:53,599
why he came to America,
who his friends are.

597
00:40:53,767 --> 00:40:55,758
That means me
and Apple Annie.

598
00:40:55,927 --> 00:40:58,760
Sure, a guy named Winchell
would give his right eye

599
00:40:58,927 --> 00:41:00,565
for a story like this.

600
00:41:00,727 --> 00:41:03,195
I told you you couldn't
get away with it!

601
00:41:05,127 --> 00:41:06,958
Why didn't you think of that?

602
00:41:07,127 --> 00:41:08,799
Why didn't l think of it?

603
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:12,243
Yeah. Why tell me now?
What are we gonna do?

604
00:41:12,447 --> 00:41:15,962
What are you gonna do?
You started it. It's your party.

605
00:41:16,127 --> 00:41:18,118
Well, l'm leaving it to you.

606
00:41:18,287 --> 00:41:20,642
You better see
those reporters stay away.

607
00:41:20,807 --> 00:41:23,082
- What time's that boat come in?
- I hope it sinks.

608
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:24,396
In about an hour.

609
00:41:24,567 --> 00:41:27,035
I better go with you
to see nothing goes wrong.

610
00:41:28,047 --> 00:41:29,958
- Come on, judge.
- Coming!

611
00:41:31,047 --> 00:41:33,163
Goodbye, Sad Eyes.

612
00:41:45,567 --> 00:41:47,364
Some 'phonus balonus' round here.

613
00:41:47,527 --> 00:41:49,643
Yeah, Dave the Dude
isn't here for his health.

614
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:51,479
His whole mob ain't.

615
00:41:59,967 --> 00:42:03,084
Tell your mugs to hold the circle
and don't let anyone near us.

616
00:42:03,247 --> 00:42:06,045
Don't worry, the only way
they get in is with a tank.

617
00:42:08,247 --> 00:42:11,080
- Let's see what happens.
- Not a bad idea.

618
00:42:12,727 --> 00:42:15,321
- How do l look?
- Great. Okay.

619
00:42:16,007 --> 00:42:18,805
- How does Annie look?
- You wouldn't know her, Schultzie.

620
00:42:18,967 --> 00:42:22,198
I remember when Annie
looked like that all the time.

621
00:42:22,687 --> 00:42:25,838
Notterhead took me over
and she smelled good.

622
00:42:31,767 --> 00:42:33,405
I can hardly believe it.

623
00:42:34,327 --> 00:42:38,320
In a little while l'll be
holding my baby in my arms.

624
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:53,475
Yes, there she is.

625
00:42:53,647 --> 00:42:56,036
There she is!
Louise! Louise!

626
00:43:10,287 --> 00:43:13,882
Louise! Louise!
Look!

627
00:43:16,567 --> 00:43:19,206
Louise, it's your mother.

628
00:43:20,327 --> 00:43:22,602
There's Mother!

629
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:25,327
She recognizes me.
She recognizes me.

630
00:43:26,247 --> 00:43:28,522
It's mother! It's mother dear!

631
00:43:28,687 --> 00:43:29,961
Mother!

632
00:43:31,447 --> 00:43:33,642
Louise. Louise.

633
00:43:46,247 --> 00:43:47,805
I can't wait.

634
00:43:49,487 --> 00:43:53,719
She'll be down.

635
00:44:03,007 --> 00:44:05,475
Louise! Louise!

636
00:44:19,847 --> 00:44:21,200
Louise!

637
00:44:22,287 --> 00:44:23,845
My baby.

638
00:44:31,127 --> 00:44:34,437
Let me look at you.
You're beautiful.

639
00:44:34,607 --> 00:44:36,802
I'm so happy.

640
00:44:36,967 --> 00:44:39,162
I'd know you anywhere.

641
00:44:39,407 --> 00:44:41,841
- What are they doing?
- They're kissing.

642
00:44:42,007 --> 00:44:44,840
- Is Annie happy?
- Yeah, she's crying.

643
00:44:46,927 --> 00:44:48,883
My sweet!

644
00:44:50,647 --> 00:44:53,525
You're just as
l pictured you, Mother.

645
00:44:53,687 --> 00:44:56,201
- My baby.
- Just as l pictured you.

646
00:44:59,927 --> 00:45:02,760
Enough tears around here
to float a battleship.

647
00:45:08,927 --> 00:45:11,077
This is your stepfather, dear.

648
00:45:11,247 --> 00:45:13,044
Mother's written me
so much about you.

649
00:45:17,527 --> 00:45:20,519
May l present
Count Alfonso Romero

650
00:45:20,687 --> 00:45:22,325
and his son, Carlos.

651
00:45:22,487 --> 00:45:23,681
How do you do?

652
00:45:23,847 --> 00:45:25,724
It is indeed a pleasure,
my dear Count.

653
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:27,718
We've been looking forward
to this visit for some time.

654
00:45:27,887 --> 00:45:29,766
Thank you.

655
00:45:29,767 --> 00:45:31,439
How stupid of me.

656
00:45:31,607 --> 00:45:34,485
This is...
your Uncle David.

657
00:45:35,007 --> 00:45:36,042
My uncle?

658
00:45:36,407 --> 00:45:38,363
I didn't know l had an uncle.

659
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:41,678
You must be Father's brother.

660
00:45:42,127 --> 00:45:43,246
I'm so pleased.

661
00:45:43,247 --> 00:45:44,839
Why, Mother, you didn't write
a word about him.

662
00:45:45,127 --> 00:45:48,403
That's because Brother David
is the black sheep of the family.

663
00:45:49,287 --> 00:45:51,357
I want you to meet Count Romero

664
00:45:51,527 --> 00:45:52,960
and his son Carlos.

665
00:45:53,607 --> 00:45:56,201
- This is my uncle, David Manville.
- How do you do?

666
00:45:58,207 --> 00:46:00,767
- Where do you think you're going?
- Are you talking to me?

667
00:46:01,327 --> 00:46:03,204
I ain't talking to your Aunt Tilly.

668
00:46:03,607 --> 00:46:06,280
I'm a news reporter.
I want to chat with the Count.

669
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:09,042
You're wrong. He ain't no Count.

670
00:46:09,207 --> 00:46:10,086
No?

671
00:46:10,087 --> 00:46:12,317
Yeah, somebody threw you
a bum steer.

672
00:46:12,487 --> 00:46:14,523
Shows you what
a rumor will do.

673
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:19,440
What you want to do
is go over to Pier 48.

674
00:46:19,607 --> 00:46:21,563
There's a boat coming in
from the Argentines.

675
00:46:21,727 --> 00:46:24,321
Maybe there's a king and queen
on it, you can't tell.

676
00:46:24,487 --> 00:46:27,524
Take this man to Pier 48.
It's in the Bronx.

677
00:46:27,687 --> 00:46:30,884
- But 48 is down by the Battery.
- In the Bronx!

678
00:46:35,727 --> 00:46:37,080
Wonder what their racket is?

679
00:46:37,447 --> 00:46:39,677
Looks like a couple of
foreigners being taken over.

680
00:46:40,487 --> 00:46:41,920
Let's talk to the Dude.

681
00:46:47,767 --> 00:46:49,758
Happy, a couple of cops
are going to see the Dude.

682
00:46:51,047 --> 00:46:52,366
Holy smoke! We gotta stop 'em.

683
00:46:52,527 --> 00:46:54,245
Go start a fight.
Sock the Weasel.

684
00:46:54,407 --> 00:46:57,001
- The Weasel? He's my brother!
- I said sock him.

685
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:03,081
Hey, Weasel.
I hate to do this.

686
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:08,679
Fight! Fight!

687
00:47:11,087 --> 00:47:12,566
Fight! Fight!

688
00:47:14,727 --> 00:47:17,195
- Your car is waiting, sir.
- Thank you, my good man.

689
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:19,198
Am-scray!
A couple of oos-bay!

690
00:47:19,367 --> 00:47:22,325
We'd better be going.
The cars are waiting.

691
00:47:22,487 --> 00:47:24,717
You'll enjoy the ride, Count.

692
00:47:31,767 --> 00:47:34,235
- Know where the family went?
- They went for a ride, sir.

693
00:47:34,407 --> 00:47:37,046
- Where did they go yesterday?
- Went riding, l think, sir.

694
00:47:37,287 --> 00:47:39,562
- The day before?
- The same thing, sir.

695
00:47:39,887 --> 00:47:41,559
That's fine. Here...

696
00:47:41,927 --> 00:47:43,645
that's for your expenses.

697
00:47:44,567 --> 00:47:47,001
- And that's for you.
- Thank you, sir.

698
00:47:47,167 --> 00:47:49,283
- Remember your general orders?
- Yes, sir.

699
00:47:49,447 --> 00:47:52,007
"If l'm asked any questions,
l know nothing.

700
00:47:52,727 --> 00:47:55,195
As a matter of fact,
l'm completely dumb."

701
00:47:55,367 --> 00:47:57,039
Fine.
You think you can do it?

702
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:58,276
That should be a cinch.

703
00:47:58,487 --> 00:48:00,166
I beg your pardon, sir?

704
00:48:00,167 --> 00:48:03,284
I said, that should be
a lead pipe cinch.

705
00:48:04,367 --> 00:48:07,882
If l had a choice of weapons
with you, sir, l'd choose grammar.

706
00:48:16,087 --> 00:48:18,317
- Remember, don't flop on this.
- No, sir.

707
00:48:18,487 --> 00:48:20,478
If you do, your family
better send for the body.

708
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:23,844
- I have no family, sir.
- You won't have no body neither.

709
00:48:24,527 --> 00:48:25,596
Nobody...

710
00:48:30,687 --> 00:48:33,599
Come on. I don't wanna be here
when the family gets back.

711
00:48:44,407 --> 00:48:46,317
Uncle David!

712
00:48:46,367 --> 00:48:48,243
Hello.

713
00:48:48,327 --> 00:48:51,080
There you are.
I'm so glad to see you.

714
00:48:52,527 --> 00:48:53,926
Hello, Mr. Manville.

715
00:48:54,087 --> 00:48:56,078
Where have you been?
We missed you terribly.

716
00:48:56,367 --> 00:48:57,482
Well, that's something.

717
00:48:57,647 --> 00:49:00,764
Don't be so strange.
Everybody's crazy about you.

718
00:49:01,007 --> 00:49:03,316
Carlos and l are going to
name our children after you.

719
00:49:04,207 --> 00:49:07,916
If we're talking about children,
be a good idea to get married.

720
00:49:09,407 --> 00:49:11,238
- When does it take place?
- I don't know.

721
00:49:11,407 --> 00:49:13,477
Everyone's making a fuss about it.

722
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:16,639
Mother wants the wedding here,
for just the family.

723
00:49:16,847 --> 00:49:19,839
The Count wants it in Spain
with the whole world attending.

724
00:49:20,047 --> 00:49:21,486
Sorry, Ma...

725
00:49:21,487 --> 00:49:24,365
We don't care where it happens,
as long as it happens.

726
00:49:24,527 --> 00:49:25,846
That's the way to talk.

727
00:49:26,367 --> 00:49:28,403
- Hello, Brother David.
- Edward.

728
00:49:28,567 --> 00:49:32,242
- Hello, Mr. McGuire.
- Judge.

729
00:49:33,047 --> 00:49:35,515
You've all met David's secretary.

730
00:49:37,527 --> 00:49:40,246
Yeah, my... secretary, everybody.

731
00:49:40,567 --> 00:49:42,876
I'm so glad you came, Mr. McGuire.

732
00:49:43,487 --> 00:49:46,285
You might want to
invite him to our reception.

733
00:49:46,447 --> 00:49:49,007
Sure, good idea.
Come on, Happy.

734
00:49:53,167 --> 00:49:54,316
Reception?

735
00:49:54,487 --> 00:49:55,681
What do you mean 'reception'?

736
00:49:55,847 --> 00:49:58,725
We're having a reception
for the folks day after tomorrow,

737
00:49:58,887 --> 00:50:00,718
the night their boat
returns to Spain.

738
00:50:00,887 --> 00:50:02,957
Isn't that just dandy.

739
00:50:03,487 --> 00:50:05,284
You're surprised,
aren't you, Brother David?

740
00:50:06,287 --> 00:50:07,126
Yeah.

741
00:50:07,127 --> 00:50:09,118
Thought you would be, knowing me.

742
00:50:09,287 --> 00:50:11,926
I've never known a man to detest
receptions so violently

743
00:50:12,087 --> 00:50:14,521
as the judge.

744
00:50:15,527 --> 00:50:18,963
Who's coming, Brother Edward?

745
00:50:19,527 --> 00:50:21,119
Just a few of our friends.

746
00:50:21,287 --> 00:50:23,755
A small affair,
100, 150 perhaps.

747
00:50:23,927 --> 00:50:25,076
Hardly a handful.

748
00:50:25,247 --> 00:50:28,239
The Count is tired of
seeing buildings, aren't you?

749
00:50:28,407 --> 00:50:30,363
He wants to meet our friends.

750
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,358
The Count will love our friends.

751
00:50:32,527 --> 00:50:36,122
Of course, l'll look to you,
Brother David, to help me.

752
00:50:36,287 --> 00:50:37,766
Of course, of course.

753
00:50:38,767 --> 00:50:41,884
I'd like to have a talk with you
before you do anything about it.

754
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:44,402
There's one or two things
l want to straighten you out on.

755
00:50:44,567 --> 00:50:46,523
By all means, Brother David.

756
00:50:46,807 --> 00:50:49,719
- Yes, john?
- A newspaperman to see you, sir.

757
00:50:49,887 --> 00:50:51,115
What does he want, john?

758
00:50:51,287 --> 00:50:54,518
Perhaps he's heard about the Count
and wants to write about him.

759
00:50:54,687 --> 00:50:58,123
Perhaps you better see him
on your way out, Brother David.

760
00:50:58,287 --> 00:51:01,120
You're so clever at
handling newspapermen.

761
00:51:01,287 --> 00:51:02,356
I'll handle him.

762
00:51:09,807 --> 00:51:11,604
What can we do for you?

763
00:51:11,767 --> 00:51:13,564
Society reporter, The Star.

764
00:51:13,727 --> 00:51:15,638
I want to get a story on
Mrs. E. Worthington Manville.

765
00:51:15,807 --> 00:51:18,640
I can't find mention of her
in the social register.

766
00:51:18,807 --> 00:51:22,163
Imagine that? He couldn't
find her in the social register.

767
00:51:22,327 --> 00:51:24,921
- I can't understand it.
- What did you want to know?

768
00:51:25,087 --> 00:51:27,442
Just a general biography.

769
00:51:27,607 --> 00:51:29,996
Say, wait a minute.
Aren't you Dave the Dude?

770
00:51:30,167 --> 00:51:31,395
Dave the Dude?

771
00:51:31,567 --> 00:51:33,239
What's he talking about, Albert?

772
00:51:33,407 --> 00:51:36,126
The house is full of guests.
Let's go somewhere undisturbed.

773
00:51:36,287 --> 00:51:39,836
Alright, but l could swear
that you're Dave the Dude.

774
00:51:40,367 --> 00:51:43,245
There's a room here
that's not often used.

775
00:51:43,687 --> 00:51:45,518
Sure we won't
be disturbed, Arthur?

776
00:51:45,687 --> 00:51:47,166
No, not a chance, uncle.

777
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:49,602
This is for family heirlooms.
Some of them go way back.

778
00:52:26,607 --> 00:52:27,676
Again?

779
00:52:38,647 --> 00:52:41,081
You'll always love me,
won't you, Carlos?

780
00:52:41,247 --> 00:52:42,600
You know l will.

781
00:52:47,087 --> 00:52:49,078
Has your father said anything yet?

782
00:52:50,847 --> 00:52:52,726
No.

783
00:52:52,727 --> 00:52:55,161
What will we do if
he doesn't give his consent?

784
00:52:55,527 --> 00:52:57,597
If he doesn't like Mother and Dad?

785
00:52:58,007 --> 00:53:01,044
- What will we do, Carlos?
- Don't be worried, darling.

786
00:53:01,927 --> 00:53:04,043
He's really fond of them.

787
00:53:04,727 --> 00:53:07,525
He likes to be formal about things.

788
00:53:07,887 --> 00:53:10,037
I'd just die if anything happens.

789
00:53:13,247 --> 00:53:15,044
I'll just die, Carlos.

790
00:53:19,247 --> 00:53:20,362
Mother?

791
00:53:22,927 --> 00:53:24,758
I was in my room,

792
00:53:24,887 --> 00:53:26,764
and l was so lonesome.

793
00:53:27,647 --> 00:53:30,878
You don't mind if l
pay you a little visit?

794
00:53:31,047 --> 00:53:33,197
- Of course not.
- It's my fault.

795
00:53:33,367 --> 00:53:36,484
I've taken up Louise's time.
I've been terribly selfish.

796
00:53:36,647 --> 00:53:38,956
No, you haven't.
You've been sweet.

797
00:53:39,127 --> 00:53:41,357
I'll go in and talk to Dad,
if you'll excuse me.

798
00:53:41,527 --> 00:53:42,926
Good night, Mother.

799
00:53:43,087 --> 00:53:45,157
You don't mind my
calling you Mother, do you?

800
00:53:45,327 --> 00:53:47,397
- I just love it.
- Thank you.

801
00:53:47,567 --> 00:53:49,444
- Night, Louise.
- Good night, Carlos.

802
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:52,596
He's a lovely boy.

803
00:53:52,967 --> 00:53:54,844
Mother, l'm so happy.

804
00:53:57,207 --> 00:53:58,925
My baby.

805
00:54:01,927 --> 00:54:03,486
Mother?

806
00:54:03,487 --> 00:54:05,159
Yes, my sweet.

807
00:54:05,327 --> 00:54:07,682
You don't think anything can happen?

808
00:54:08,407 --> 00:54:09,681
Happen?

809
00:54:11,367 --> 00:54:13,403
I guess l've just been foolish,

810
00:54:14,207 --> 00:54:16,675
because l've been wishing so hard.

811
00:54:17,967 --> 00:54:22,324
Mother, did you ever wish
for anything so hard that...?

812
00:54:25,287 --> 00:54:27,847
Nothing's going to happen.

813
00:54:28,407 --> 00:54:31,399
Nothing's going to happen.

814
00:54:35,687 --> 00:54:37,200
Reception, huh?

815
00:54:37,367 --> 00:54:39,278
You stayed up too late.

816
00:54:39,447 --> 00:54:41,881
You're in a swell apartment
and you began to believe it.

817
00:54:42,047 --> 00:54:44,766
For my dough, you're still
a penny-ante pool shark!

818
00:54:44,927 --> 00:54:47,282
- Now after all, my dear Dude...
- Oh, shut up.

819
00:54:47,447 --> 00:54:50,439
- Don't get cross, Brother David.
- Don't 'Brother David' me!

820
00:54:50,607 --> 00:54:51,835
Listen you...

821
00:54:53,327 --> 00:54:55,204
Hello? Yeah.
What do you want?

822
00:54:55,367 --> 00:54:57,198
I'm sorry to trouble you, Mr. Dude,

823
00:54:57,367 --> 00:55:00,643
but the Count asked me to get
the Spanish Consulate on the phone.

824
00:55:00,807 --> 00:55:02,559
Why is he calling him?

825
00:55:03,447 --> 00:55:06,723
What do you know about that?
He's calling the Spanish Consulate.

826
00:55:06,887 --> 00:55:08,559
Maybe he's checking up on us.

827
00:55:08,727 --> 00:55:11,605
- How's your Spanish, Happy?
- Good as my French, they smell.

828
00:55:11,767 --> 00:55:12,961
And what about you?

829
00:55:13,127 --> 00:55:15,163
I'll tell you,
when l was in Havana.

830
00:55:15,327 --> 00:55:17,363
Never mind that!
Hello?

831
00:55:24,767 --> 00:55:28,919
- The Spanish Consulate, sir.
- Thank you very much.

832
00:55:29,207 --> 00:55:32,199
Close the door, please.

833
00:55:37,887 --> 00:55:41,004
<i>Consular not home.
Just me, Japanese boy.</i>

834
00:55:41,167 --> 00:55:43,397
<i>No, sir.
Consular not home.</i>

835
00:55:43,567 --> 00:55:46,479
<i>He gone away long time.
Maybe come back next week.</i>

836
00:55:46,647 --> 00:55:49,764
<i>No, me Japanese boy.
Consular not home. Thank you.</i>

837
00:55:49,927 --> 00:55:52,680
Very good.
Very, very good.

838
00:55:57,007 --> 00:55:58,486
Japanese boy.

839
00:55:59,967 --> 00:56:02,276
Very difficult to understand.

840
00:56:03,567 --> 00:56:07,003
I think he said
"Consular out of town".

841
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:10,125
I'm glad. I think it was
very unsportsmanlike.

842
00:56:10,287 --> 00:56:11,286
Carlos!

843
00:56:11,287 --> 00:56:13,881
I'm sorry!

844
00:56:17,777 --> 00:56:19,733
<i>- Yeah?
- Cap. Moore, lnspector.</i>

845
00:56:19,897 --> 00:56:21,728
<i>- Send him right in!
- Yes, sir.</i>

846
00:56:23,097 --> 00:56:24,132
Well?

847
00:56:25,137 --> 00:56:26,616
Nothing doing, lnspector.

848
00:56:26,777 --> 00:56:29,894
That's what you told me yesterday
and the day before that.

849
00:56:30,057 --> 00:56:33,208
We gotta find
those three reporters and quick!

850
00:56:33,377 --> 00:56:34,935
Look what the newspapers
are doing to us!

851
00:56:35,097 --> 00:56:36,769
I've done everything,
covered every angle.

852
00:56:36,937 --> 00:56:39,770
Nothing but excuses,
that's all l've been getting.

853
00:56:39,937 --> 00:56:41,609
You better get going...

854
00:56:42,937 --> 00:56:44,734
<i>- Yeah?
- The Commissioner on the phone.</i>

855
00:56:44,897 --> 00:56:46,410
<i>- Who?
- The Commissioner.</i>

856
00:56:47,097 --> 00:56:50,248
There he is again.
Fourth time today.

857
00:56:50,897 --> 00:56:52,216
Hello, Commissioner.

858
00:56:52,417 --> 00:56:55,409
No. I've got Cap. Moore in
my office now. Not a thing yet.

859
00:56:55,577 --> 00:56:58,375
Not a thing? That's all l've been
getting for the last few days.

860
00:56:58,537 --> 00:57:00,129
What have you got there,
a bunch of schoolboys?

861
00:57:00,297 --> 00:57:03,494
Listen, McCreary, l'm not gonna be
made the goat of the department.

862
00:57:03,657 --> 00:57:05,534
Find those reporters or l'll...

863
00:57:06,577 --> 00:57:07,496
Hello?

864
00:57:07,497 --> 00:57:09,215
<i>- Mayor's on the phone, sir.
- The Mayor?</i>

865
00:57:09,377 --> 00:57:11,493
<i>- Yes, sir.
- Didn't you tell him l was out?</i>

866
00:57:11,657 --> 00:57:13,488
<i>- No, l didn 't.
- Alright, put him on.</i>

867
00:57:13,657 --> 00:57:14,496
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

868
00:57:14,497 --> 00:57:16,567
Hold on a minute.
Mayor's on the phone again.

869
00:57:18,177 --> 00:57:20,691
Hello?
Yes, hello, Chief.

870
00:57:20,857 --> 00:57:23,166
No, l was just talking to
lnspector McCreary.

871
00:57:23,337 --> 00:57:24,929
Not a thing yet.

872
00:57:25,097 --> 00:57:26,928
What are you going to do about it?

873
00:57:27,097 --> 00:57:29,452
Sit and wait for those reporters
to walk into your office?

874
00:57:29,617 --> 00:57:32,256
Yes, yes. I've heard that before.

875
00:57:32,417 --> 00:57:35,409
I'm only interested in one thing.
I want some action and quick!

876
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:37,693
Every editor in town
is in my office this minute.

877
00:57:37,857 --> 00:57:41,406
You'll get front page editorial
every day till something's done.

878
00:57:41,577 --> 00:57:44,489
Our reporters can't get news
without a bodyguard.

879
00:57:44,657 --> 00:57:46,488
I want this clear, Commissioner:
I refuse to stand the brunt

880
00:57:46,657 --> 00:57:48,852
for the incompetence of
the Police Department!

881
00:57:49,017 --> 00:57:51,212
If City administration can't do
anything, perhaps the State can.

882
00:57:51,377 --> 00:57:54,016
When the Governor gets in town
this afternoon, we'll see him.

883
00:57:54,177 --> 00:57:57,374
Find those reporters or l'll be
forced to ask for your resignation.

884
00:57:57,537 --> 00:57:58,731
Now that's final.

885
00:58:04,577 --> 00:58:07,250
Hello, McCreary.
Now get this straight,

886
00:58:07,417 --> 00:58:10,375
dig up those reporters
or l'll get me another boy.

887
00:58:10,537 --> 00:58:11,731
And that's that!

888
00:58:14,577 --> 00:58:15,646
Captain,

889
00:58:16,697 --> 00:58:20,087
l'm giving you 24 hours
to find those reporters.

890
00:58:20,257 --> 00:58:22,566
If you can't, you'd better start
looking for another job.

891
00:58:22,737 --> 00:58:23,856
And that's the works!

892
00:58:23,857 --> 00:58:24,936
Yes, sir.

893
00:58:24,937 --> 00:58:26,495
What is it, Murphy?

894
00:58:26,657 --> 00:58:28,727
A young fella with
an angle on the reporter business.

895
00:58:28,897 --> 00:58:31,206
- Come on, speak up.
- A funny thing happened.

896
00:58:31,377 --> 00:58:33,937
I was down at the boats
and went to talk to a count,

897
00:58:34,097 --> 00:58:35,928
when a couple of yeggs
grabbed me and put me in a car.

898
00:58:36,097 --> 00:58:38,053
- What happened?
- They took me to the Bronx?

899
00:58:38,217 --> 00:58:40,811
- How'd you get away?
- They stopped and l jumped out.

900
00:58:40,977 --> 00:58:43,207
- Who were the men?
- I don't know.

901
00:58:43,377 --> 00:58:45,447
Maybe l can tell you
something about that, lnspector.

902
00:58:45,617 --> 00:58:47,496
When did this happen?

903
00:58:47,497 --> 00:58:50,057
- Last Tuesday.
- That checks all right.

904
00:58:50,217 --> 00:58:51,969
Ken and l were down
working the pier last week.

905
00:58:52,137 --> 00:58:53,855
Dave the Dude
was meeting some people.

906
00:58:54,017 --> 00:58:56,212
Had his whole mob with him.
We thought it was funny.

907
00:58:56,377 --> 00:58:58,015
Dave the Dude, eh?

908
00:58:58,177 --> 00:59:00,566
This is beginning to
look like a police department.

909
00:59:00,737 --> 00:59:02,534
Sit down, l want to talk to you.

910
00:59:04,057 --> 00:59:07,015
Get this straight. I ain't having
this rehearsal 'cause l like it!

911
00:59:07,177 --> 00:59:08,895
The reception is tomorrow night.

912
00:59:09,057 --> 00:59:11,935
You don't rehearse now,
you'll bollocks up the thing.

913
00:59:12,097 --> 00:59:15,248
You've got your titles, speeches,
everything laid out.

914
00:59:15,417 --> 00:59:18,375
First learn your speeches.
The judge went to a lot of trouble

915
00:59:18,537 --> 00:59:21,609
to rig up some swell ones
and l don't want ya to blow 'em.

916
00:59:21,777 --> 00:59:23,335
Alright, come on. Let's get going.

917
00:59:27,697 --> 00:59:31,372
No, no. You're too stiff,
you're too stiff.

918
00:59:31,777 --> 00:59:33,893
Relax, can't you? Relax.

919
00:59:35,337 --> 00:59:38,966
Butch, your legs are buckling.
Bend from the waist.

920
00:59:39,897 --> 00:59:41,216
Harry the Horse...

921
00:59:41,377 --> 00:59:44,175
you don't want to
look like you're gonna kick her!

922
00:59:44,337 --> 00:59:47,647
No, and smile.
Go on, keep smiling.

923
00:59:47,817 --> 00:59:50,012
Sure, you're supposed to be
having a good time.

924
00:59:51,017 --> 00:59:53,929
Louie the Lug.
What do you think you're doing?

925
00:59:54,097 --> 00:59:57,806
You're the Ambassador to Turkey,
not a wrestler.

926
00:59:57,897 --> 01:00:00,809
Holy mackerel,
this is awful.

927
01:00:00,977 --> 01:00:04,174
Cheesecake. What's the matter?
Is it too much for you?

928
01:00:04,617 --> 01:00:07,848
- No, l can do it. Only...
- Only what?

929
01:00:08,017 --> 01:00:10,212
I'm as good as
Louie the Lug is any day.

930
01:00:10,377 --> 01:00:12,413
If he's Ambassador,
l oughta be King.

931
01:00:12,577 --> 01:00:15,808
Listen, Secretary of the lnterior
is bigger than Ambassador.

932
01:00:15,977 --> 01:00:17,056
- Yeah?
- Sure.

933
01:00:17,057 --> 01:00:19,617
You can't fool me.
A secretary is a secretary.

934
01:00:19,777 --> 01:00:22,849
Then you're President of the Board.
How do you like that?

935
01:00:23,017 --> 01:00:24,655
President?
Now that's something like it!

936
01:00:24,817 --> 01:00:26,933
Judge, we got a new
President of the Board.

937
01:00:27,097 --> 01:00:28,132
Check!

938
01:00:28,417 --> 01:00:30,373
Come here. You too, Micks.

939
01:00:30,697 --> 01:00:32,688
You two do your stuff.

940
01:00:32,857 --> 01:00:35,371
Quiet! The rest of
you guys, quiet!

941
01:00:36,137 --> 01:00:39,095
Micks here's the Count, see?

942
01:00:39,257 --> 01:00:40,690
Now l want to hear your speech.

943
01:00:41,977 --> 01:00:45,174
- Did l knocked onto this guy?
- Well, you're introduced to him.

944
01:00:45,337 --> 01:00:46,929
I get ya, l get ya.

945
01:00:47,817 --> 01:00:49,045
Count...

946
01:00:49,537 --> 01:00:50,856
l am...

947
01:00:51,017 --> 01:00:53,406
lt's a rare...

948
01:00:54,337 --> 01:00:56,373
its a rare privy...

949
01:00:56,977 --> 01:00:58,410
privy...

950
01:00:58,577 --> 01:01:01,410
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?

951
01:01:01,577 --> 01:01:03,886
It's a rare 'privilege', you dope.

952
01:01:04,057 --> 01:01:06,810
I can't make the grade with
words like this. Look...

953
01:01:07,137 --> 01:01:10,607
- if the judge...
- Get away. You're driving me nuts!

954
01:01:12,177 --> 01:01:14,486
Well, what's the matter?
Are you all quitting?

955
01:01:15,257 --> 01:01:17,851
Come on. Let's get going.
Rehearse. Rehearse!

956
01:01:18,697 --> 01:01:20,892
Charmed to meet you Count.

957
01:01:21,057 --> 01:01:22,410
You stink.

958
01:01:25,217 --> 01:01:26,216
Call it,

959
01:01:26,217 --> 01:01:27,366
- Heads.
- Tails!

960
01:01:27,537 --> 01:01:29,493
<i>That makes me the King of Siam.</i>

961
01:01:29,657 --> 01:01:32,251
Couple more wins and you'll be
in charge of the whole world.

962
01:01:33,457 --> 01:01:36,813
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Quiet, guest.

963
01:01:36,977 --> 01:01:39,207
Quiet.
Quiet everybody!

964
01:01:39,377 --> 01:01:42,050
Look like we'll have to
take it one thing at a time.

965
01:01:42,217 --> 01:01:45,766
Forget the speeches right now.
Just take up the bowing.

966
01:01:45,937 --> 01:01:48,690
Judge, come and
show 'em how to bow.

967
01:01:49,097 --> 01:01:50,815
Now watch this close.

968
01:01:53,417 --> 01:01:56,170
See, his knees don't buckle.

969
01:01:56,337 --> 01:01:58,805
Look where the hand is.
Isn't that graceful?

970
01:01:59,337 --> 01:02:00,816
Look at that smile.

971
01:02:00,977 --> 01:02:04,094
See, there ain't
anything tough about that.

972
01:02:04,577 --> 01:02:07,375
Come on, everybody do it.
Now, no speeches.

973
01:02:07,537 --> 01:02:09,846
Just bow.
Everybody just bow now.

974
01:02:24,617 --> 01:02:26,847
I don't believe it.

975
01:02:28,937 --> 01:02:31,815
Where do you think you're going?
Come here.

976
01:02:38,817 --> 01:02:40,535
About time you showed up.

977
01:02:41,817 --> 01:02:43,489
I beg your...

978
01:02:43,777 --> 01:02:45,290
You got me doing it now.

979
01:02:45,657 --> 01:02:47,568
Don't worry, you could stand
plenty of practice.

980
01:02:47,737 --> 01:02:49,489
Cut the clowning.

981
01:02:49,657 --> 01:02:51,693
These guys have got me crazy.

982
01:02:51,857 --> 01:02:53,575
You're not doin' them any good.

983
01:02:53,737 --> 01:02:56,615
I'm going through with it, see?
Hey, stop it. Stop it.

984
01:02:57,177 --> 01:02:59,566
Wait a minute everybody now.

985
01:03:00,137 --> 01:03:03,209
Trouble with a lot of you guys
is you don't take this serious.

986
01:03:03,377 --> 01:03:05,288
Well, let me tell you something.
It's serious...

987
01:03:05,457 --> 01:03:08,449
and the guy that don't think it is
can take it on the lam now.

988
01:03:10,817 --> 01:03:13,854
Listen fellas, l don't want to
get tough with ya,

989
01:03:14,017 --> 01:03:15,973
but we gotta go through with it.

990
01:03:16,697 --> 01:03:18,016
It ain't for me.

991
01:03:18,177 --> 01:03:20,168
Nobody's gonna get
anything outta it.

992
01:03:20,337 --> 01:03:21,850
Happy here thinks l'm nuts.

993
01:03:22,017 --> 01:03:23,928
Well, maybe l am,
l don't know.

994
01:03:24,097 --> 01:03:26,611
But l started it and
l gotta go through with it.

995
01:03:27,137 --> 01:03:29,446
It's for Apple Annie, see?

996
01:03:29,617 --> 01:03:32,689
She's in a tough spot and it's
up to us to give her a break.

997
01:03:32,857 --> 01:03:35,325
If anything goes wrong
tomorrow night,

998
01:03:35,497 --> 01:03:37,408
there's no telling what she'll do.

999
01:03:37,577 --> 01:03:39,807
So let's practice
and practice hard.

1000
01:03:39,977 --> 01:03:41,695
Now we'll take up
the Apple Annie speech.

1001
01:03:41,857 --> 01:03:43,973
All you girls
are Apple Annie, see?

1002
01:03:44,137 --> 01:03:45,775
Fellas, pick yourself a dame.

1003
01:03:45,937 --> 01:03:48,451
You're being introduced to her.
Alright, let's go.

1004
01:03:48,617 --> 01:03:50,687
Alright, everybody.
Let's get organized.

1005
01:03:50,857 --> 01:03:53,769
The Apple Annie speech.
Put a little ginger into it.

1006
01:04:06,257 --> 01:04:08,612
- Quiet, everybody.
- Quiet, everybody.

1007
01:04:08,777 --> 01:04:10,654
- Quiet!
- Quiet!

1008
01:04:11,057 --> 01:04:13,207
The lndians are upon us.

1009
01:04:13,457 --> 01:04:15,209
- Hello, Dude.
- Hi.

1010
01:04:16,097 --> 01:04:19,453
- What's going on around here?
- Nothing you'd be interested in.

1011
01:04:19,617 --> 01:04:22,211
Funny your whole mob
up here at one time.

1012
01:04:22,377 --> 01:04:24,937
Anything wrong with a guy
having his friends up?

1013
01:04:25,097 --> 01:04:27,053
No, nothing wrong in that.

1014
01:04:27,617 --> 01:04:29,926
These mugs are classy, ain't they?

1015
01:04:30,097 --> 01:04:33,453
Okay, everybody. Go on home.
Rehearsal is over.

1016
01:04:34,497 --> 01:04:35,976
Putting on a show, Dude?

1017
01:04:36,137 --> 01:04:38,651
- Yeah.
- Yeah, a benefit performance.

1018
01:04:40,337 --> 01:04:41,736
Good night, Dude.

1019
01:04:42,377 --> 01:04:43,492
So long.

1020
01:04:57,297 --> 01:04:59,288
Dude and Fish is what gets me.

1021
01:04:59,937 --> 01:05:01,609
The whole mob was up there.

1022
01:05:01,777 --> 01:05:03,847
You didn't ask about
the three reporters, did ya?

1023
01:05:04,337 --> 01:05:05,565
That's good.

1024
01:05:07,017 --> 01:05:09,372
<i>- Yes, sir?
- Send in O'Brien and Gibbons.</i>

1025
01:05:10,537 --> 01:05:13,768
Listen, you two fellas
watch the Dude.

1026
01:05:13,937 --> 01:05:15,256
Don't let him know he's tailed.

1027
01:05:15,417 --> 01:05:17,851
Anything looks phony,
let me know right away.

1028
01:05:18,097 --> 01:05:21,134
I want a tail on
every one of the Dude's mob.

1029
01:05:21,297 --> 01:05:23,094
There names are on file.

1030
01:05:23,257 --> 01:05:25,293
Use every man in
the Department if you have to.

1031
01:05:25,457 --> 01:05:28,654
I want those yeggs shadowed
24 hours a day, starting right now.

1032
01:05:28,817 --> 01:05:30,216
So get going!

1033
01:05:42,697 --> 01:05:45,575
- Mommy.
- Sorry, darling.

1034
01:05:45,737 --> 01:05:48,456
There, go to sleep. Good night.

1035
01:05:49,217 --> 01:05:50,935
Good night, Mommy.

1036
01:06:06,497 --> 01:06:09,216
The music must be
soft and mellow.

1037
01:06:09,377 --> 01:06:11,572
Nothing harsh, nothing raucous.

1038
01:06:11,737 --> 01:06:14,535
Our guests have
very delicate nerves.

1039
01:06:14,697 --> 01:06:18,292
Play at intervals of 10 minutes.
Do we understand each other?

1040
01:06:18,817 --> 01:06:20,569
Let it happen.

1041
01:06:31,617 --> 01:06:33,335
- Are these the two men?
- Yes, sir.

1042
01:06:33,577 --> 01:06:36,091
- Do they know their requirements?
- I've explained everything, sir.

1043
01:06:36,257 --> 01:06:37,656
Excellent, john.

1044
01:06:38,737 --> 01:06:41,809
Then put some on me.

1045
01:06:41,977 --> 01:06:43,490
Put some there.

1046
01:06:45,337 --> 01:06:48,852
You're quite sure
it looks all right?

1047
01:06:49,097 --> 01:06:52,169
- Don't want it to go wrong.
- Yes, madam.

1048
01:06:52,337 --> 01:06:53,372
Come in.

1049
01:06:57,337 --> 01:06:59,646
Do my eyes deceive me,

1050
01:06:59,817 --> 01:07:02,411
or am l in the presence
of an angel?

1051
01:07:02,657 --> 01:07:04,329
Stop it, judge.

1052
01:07:04,897 --> 01:07:07,365
Never in all my
questionable career

1053
01:07:07,577 --> 01:07:09,852
have l gazed upon
such divine loveliness.

1054
01:07:10,017 --> 01:07:12,372
Stop it, judge.
Honestly, how do l look?

1055
01:07:12,537 --> 01:07:14,016
Exquisite!

1056
01:07:14,177 --> 01:07:16,645
- What time are they coming?
- Eight o'clock, my love.

1057
01:07:16,817 --> 01:07:19,854
- You think they can do it?
- Do it? They'll do it, or else!

1058
01:07:20,017 --> 01:07:23,453
Dude's been rehearsing them
till they're ready to drop.

1059
01:07:23,617 --> 01:07:26,734
- I'm so nervous.
- There, there, my little dewdrop.

1060
01:07:26,897 --> 01:07:28,330
Don't you worry.

1061
01:07:28,497 --> 01:07:31,250
If anything happens,
l'll be there to cover up.

1062
01:07:31,417 --> 01:07:35,535
- Leave it to the old judge.
- Oh, you're so good.

1063
01:07:36,137 --> 01:07:38,093
Dude and his whole mob
are up in Missouri Martin's

1064
01:07:38,257 --> 01:07:40,213
and there's a sign on
the joint: 'CIOSED'.

1065
01:07:40,377 --> 01:07:43,289
I didn't find out what it's about
but it sure looks phony.

1066
01:07:43,457 --> 01:07:45,732
There's a line of cars outside
a block long.

1067
01:07:45,897 --> 01:07:47,455
Don't let 'em get away from you.

1068
01:07:47,617 --> 01:07:50,575
What's more, don't let Dude
find out he's being watched.

1069
01:07:50,737 --> 01:07:54,412
He's a pretty shrew article.
Okay, keep in touch with me.

1070
01:07:56,417 --> 01:07:58,089
<i>- Hello?
- Moore there?</i>

1071
01:07:58,257 --> 01:07:59,815
<i>- Yes, sir.
- Put him on.</i>

1072
01:07:59,977 --> 01:08:01,046
<i>Moore talking.</i>

1073
01:08:01,217 --> 01:08:04,095
Moore, better get
the riot squad ready, 25 men.

1074
01:08:04,257 --> 01:08:06,088
Machine guns,
tear bombs, everything.

1075
01:08:06,257 --> 01:08:08,725
<i>- We may have a job on our hands.
- Alright, sir.</i>

1076
01:08:08,897 --> 01:08:12,014
Sometimes, Count, l'm a little
ashamed of my fellow Americans,

1077
01:08:12,177 --> 01:08:15,135
they way they fawn at
and worship celebrities.

1078
01:08:15,297 --> 01:08:17,572
- It's rather charming.
- They're like children.

1079
01:08:17,737 --> 01:08:20,012
You'll notice it tonight.
In your presence...

1080
01:08:20,177 --> 01:08:22,566
they'll probably stammer
and become tongue-tied.

1081
01:08:22,737 --> 01:08:25,092
I beg of you
to make allowances for them.

1082
01:08:25,257 --> 01:08:26,485
Of course.

1083
01:08:26,657 --> 01:08:29,615
Different countries,
different characteristics.

1084
01:08:29,777 --> 01:08:31,768
Which reminds me...

1085
01:08:31,937 --> 01:08:35,976
there is custom in my country
which obviously is not American.

1086
01:08:36,137 --> 01:08:38,367
I was waiting for you to mention it.

1087
01:08:38,537 --> 01:08:41,609
- What is that, Count?
- The dowry, my dear judge.

1088
01:08:41,977 --> 01:08:44,775
Nothing has been said
about the dowry.

1089
01:08:44,937 --> 01:08:47,132
- The dowry?
- The dowry.

1090
01:08:47,897 --> 01:08:49,056
The dowry.

1091
01:08:49,057 --> 01:08:52,606
I'm aware that in America it is
not considered very important,

1092
01:08:52,777 --> 01:08:54,335
but in my country...

1093
01:08:54,497 --> 01:08:56,453
An old Spanish custom, huh?

1094
01:08:56,617 --> 01:08:59,768
A very old, old custom.

1095
01:09:00,017 --> 01:09:03,089
I don't know what to say, Count.
You crept up on me with that one.

1096
01:09:03,257 --> 01:09:04,690
What was that you say?

1097
01:09:04,857 --> 01:09:07,166
I say l wasn't quite
prepared for this.

1098
01:09:07,337 --> 01:09:09,214
It's a delicate subject, you know?

1099
01:09:09,897 --> 01:09:12,855
Perhaps you do not realize
who your son is marrying?

1100
01:09:13,017 --> 01:09:14,655
A Manville, sir!

1101
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:17,570
A descendant of the General
of the Revolutionary War,

1102
01:09:17,737 --> 01:09:20,649
George Washington Manville.
You have heard of him?

1103
01:09:20,817 --> 01:09:22,614
I'm sorry, but l have not.

1104
01:09:22,977 --> 01:09:25,047
Well, that's strange.

1105
01:09:25,457 --> 01:09:28,415
And on her mother's side
she comes from the purest stock.

1106
01:09:28,817 --> 01:09:30,489
Do you know that, if not for them,

1107
01:09:30,657 --> 01:09:32,727
there would be
no apple industry in America?

1108
01:09:32,897 --> 01:09:34,376
No doubt, no doubt.

1109
01:09:34,537 --> 01:09:38,815
But my son too comes from
an old and distinguished family,

1110
01:09:38,977 --> 01:09:42,686
yet l am making settlement
equal to 50,000 dollars.

1111
01:09:43,017 --> 01:09:44,132
You are?

1112
01:09:45,137 --> 01:09:48,607
Perhaps you'd make a similar one?

1113
01:09:49,137 --> 01:09:51,014
I don't know about that.

1114
01:09:51,177 --> 01:09:53,975
If you don't wish to discuss it...

1115
01:09:54,337 --> 01:09:56,089
Well, look at this.
Billiards.

1116
01:09:56,257 --> 01:09:58,487
Why did you not tell me
you had a billiards room?

1117
01:09:58,657 --> 01:10:00,056
Do you play?

1118
01:10:00,217 --> 01:10:04,529
Do l play?
In Valencia, l am champion!

1119
01:10:04,937 --> 01:10:08,816
Isn't that just... you don't say?

1120
01:10:08,977 --> 01:10:12,208
Perhaps, before the guests arrive,
we might...

1121
01:10:12,657 --> 01:10:15,569
Nothing would give me
greater pleasure.

1122
01:10:16,257 --> 01:10:17,372
Now...

1123
01:10:27,217 --> 01:10:29,777
- About the dowry, Count...
- Yes?

1124
01:10:31,217 --> 01:10:35,290
...it occurs to me, if the children
will live in Spain with you...

1125
01:10:35,457 --> 01:10:37,527
l shall give the whole amount.

1126
01:10:37,697 --> 01:10:39,892
No, no.
I would not let you do that.

1127
01:10:40,057 --> 01:10:42,446
After all,
it is only 100,000 dollars.

1128
01:10:42,617 --> 01:10:45,336
Yes, that's true, but why should you
bear the entire burden?

1129
01:10:45,497 --> 01:10:49,126
No, nothing at all l assure you.
I can well afford it.

1130
01:10:49,297 --> 01:10:51,288
For that matter, so can l.

1131
01:10:51,457 --> 01:10:53,891
You're so gracious, l am ashamed.

1132
01:10:54,057 --> 01:10:56,935
Nothing would give me greater
pleasure than to take care of it.

1133
01:10:57,097 --> 01:10:59,657
- No, that would be unfair.
- But Seor, l want to do it.

1134
01:10:59,817 --> 01:11:02,650
No, no, no.
I'm on the daughter's side.

1135
01:11:02,817 --> 01:11:05,377
- I have that right.
- Well, Seor, l insist.

1136
01:11:05,537 --> 01:11:08,847
This is silly. We might
go on like this for hours.

1137
01:11:09,017 --> 01:11:11,975
In America, we have
ways of settling this.

1138
01:11:12,137 --> 01:11:14,935
We toss coins, or pull straws...

1139
01:11:16,657 --> 01:11:18,329
What amuses you, Count?

1140
01:11:18,497 --> 01:11:22,854
I was just thinking,
l could take advantage of you.

1141
01:11:23,017 --> 01:11:26,930
- Yes? How?
- By suggesting billiards.

1142
01:11:27,097 --> 01:11:29,975
- I don't see why not.
- No, no.

1143
01:11:30,137 --> 01:11:31,775
It would be most unfair.

1144
01:11:31,937 --> 01:11:34,212
Perhaps it won't be.
You never can tell.

1145
01:11:34,377 --> 01:11:36,971
- Do you play well?
- Do l play well?

1146
01:11:37,577 --> 01:11:39,693
I practically make my living at it.

1147
01:11:46,537 --> 01:11:48,175
I warned you.

1148
01:11:55,657 --> 01:11:59,093
Everybody on their toes.
And no drinkin', understand?

1149
01:11:59,337 --> 01:12:02,613
It won't last more than 4 hours.
They catch a boat at midnight.

1150
01:12:02,817 --> 01:12:05,206
Everybody remember who
they're supposed to be?

1151
01:12:05,377 --> 01:12:06,576
Yeah.

1152
01:12:06,577 --> 01:12:08,295
What ya got in mind for me, Dave?

1153
01:12:08,457 --> 01:12:11,130
A society leader
in New York, Missouri.

1154
01:12:11,297 --> 01:12:14,414
Tryin' to insult me?
I'm one of the family, see?

1155
01:12:14,577 --> 01:12:16,852
If there's an uncle,
there's an aunt.

1156
01:12:17,017 --> 01:12:20,168
Folks, meet the wife of
Uncle Dave the Dude Manville.

1157
01:12:20,337 --> 01:12:22,646
Look out, Dude,
she's sneakin' up on ya again.

1158
01:12:22,817 --> 01:12:25,490
Okay, anything you want.
Well, that's set.

1159
01:12:25,857 --> 01:12:29,566
And remember, you palookas,
you're gentlemen, see?

1160
01:12:29,737 --> 01:12:31,056
Come on, Happy.

1161
01:12:31,617 --> 01:12:34,450
Dave, l wanna tell ya
what a swell thing you're doing.

1162
01:12:35,017 --> 01:12:36,769
And l love you for it!

1163
01:12:36,937 --> 01:12:40,168
Wife, huh?
Go on, get away from me.

1164
01:12:46,217 --> 01:12:47,411
Hello, Smiley.

1165
01:12:49,577 --> 01:12:52,171
Look out, Dude. Cops.
Been trailing ya all day.

1166
01:13:25,937 --> 01:13:27,006
What's the matter?

1167
01:13:27,817 --> 01:13:30,615
- What's the matter, Dave?
- Cops! Millions of them.

1168
01:13:30,777 --> 01:13:33,132
Cops? I thought you said
this was on the up and up?

1169
01:13:33,297 --> 01:13:35,686
- If there's anything screwy.
- Shut up!

1170
01:13:35,857 --> 01:13:36,972
Come on, Nick, take it easy.

1171
01:13:37,137 --> 01:13:39,492
We can't go to the Marberry now.
They'll follow us.

1172
01:13:39,657 --> 01:13:42,125
- What are we gonna do?
- Do? It's cold. We call it off.

1173
01:13:42,297 --> 01:13:44,686
Call off nothing. Let me figure it.

1174
01:13:54,137 --> 01:13:55,490
What luck!

1175
01:13:55,657 --> 01:13:58,217
Amazing, isn't it?
I've been most fortunate.

1176
01:13:58,377 --> 01:14:00,447
You realize, if you
make this point, you win?

1177
01:14:00,617 --> 01:14:03,211
Really?
I'll have to make it then.

1178
01:14:04,377 --> 01:14:07,096
I'm afraid that shot is
practically impossible, Count.

1179
01:14:07,417 --> 01:14:10,489
- It can be made.
- Yes, you think so?

1180
01:14:11,497 --> 01:14:14,250
You shave the white one very fine,
go round the table,

1181
01:14:14,417 --> 01:14:15,816
meet the red one down here.

1182
01:14:16,537 --> 01:14:18,573
That's too much for me, Count.

1183
01:14:18,737 --> 01:14:20,773
Take an expert to do that.

1184
01:14:20,937 --> 01:14:23,656
Pardon me, sir. Your brother
is on the phone for you.

1185
01:14:23,817 --> 01:14:26,251
- Brother David?
- Yes, sir. He says it's important.

1186
01:14:26,417 --> 01:14:28,135
I shall be there directly.

1187
01:14:42,897 --> 01:14:44,250
You made it!

1188
01:14:44,697 --> 01:14:47,006
Oh, most fortunate.

1189
01:14:55,017 --> 01:14:57,326
Hello? Yes, this is he.

1190
01:14:58,497 --> 01:15:02,570
Congratulate me, David.
I just saved you 50,000 dollars.

1191
01:15:02,737 --> 01:15:05,297
Never mind that stuff.
Listen, we're in a jam.

1192
01:15:05,457 --> 01:15:08,494
We're stymied at Missouri Martin's.
The place is surrounded by cops.

1193
01:15:08,657 --> 01:15:09,976
Cops?

1194
01:15:09,977 --> 01:15:12,411
I don't like that at all,
my dear Dude.

1195
01:15:12,977 --> 01:15:16,811
You suggest l fold my tent
and scram into the night?

1196
01:15:16,977 --> 01:15:18,854
Don't budge outta the place.

1197
01:15:19,017 --> 01:15:21,167
Stay there and stall
till l figure something out.

1198
01:15:21,337 --> 01:15:22,850
Just as you say, Dude.

1199
01:15:23,017 --> 01:15:26,168
But l hardly relish being left
holding the well-known bag.

1200
01:15:32,257 --> 01:15:35,772
What is it, judge?
What happened?

1201
01:15:35,937 --> 01:15:38,815
Nothing at all, my dear.

1202
01:15:38,977 --> 01:15:42,447
I heard you say
something about the cops.

1203
01:15:42,817 --> 01:15:45,889
- They're not coming here, are they?
- No, of course not.

1204
01:15:46,057 --> 01:15:48,446
Don't fool me, judge.
Tell me the truth.

1205
01:15:48,617 --> 01:15:51,085
Don't get worked up.
You've got to keep your head.

1206
01:15:51,257 --> 01:15:53,896
Yes, but l'm the one...
l ought to know.

1207
01:15:54,937 --> 01:15:56,416
Don't fool me.

1208
01:15:56,577 --> 01:15:59,250
I'd rather go in there
and tell them the truth myself!

1209
01:16:11,137 --> 01:16:13,253
Stinkin' cops are still out there.

1210
01:16:48,737 --> 01:16:50,728
Thank you.

1211
01:16:53,977 --> 01:16:56,969
When are the guests
supposed to get here?

1212
01:16:58,417 --> 01:16:59,930
I don't know, sir.

1213
01:17:00,297 --> 01:17:02,765
- Could you tell me...?
- No, sir.

1214
01:17:10,257 --> 01:17:12,168
What are we going to do?

1215
01:17:12,337 --> 01:17:14,373
What if the police come here?

1216
01:17:14,537 --> 01:17:17,210
What'll l say to the Count?
What'll l say to Louise?

1217
01:17:17,377 --> 01:17:19,766
Quiet now, Annie.
The police aren't coming here.

1218
01:17:19,937 --> 01:17:22,451
Poor Louise.

1219
01:17:22,617 --> 01:17:25,529
Poor sweet and lovely girl.

1220
01:17:25,697 --> 01:17:28,769
- Don't you think, judge?
- Of course.

1221
01:17:29,337 --> 01:17:30,486
Suppose...

1222
01:17:30,657 --> 01:17:33,376
Suppose the Count should
call the wedding off?

1223
01:17:33,537 --> 01:17:36,927
It'd kill Louise.
And she'd hate me.

1224
01:17:37,097 --> 01:17:38,894
Now don't be silly, Annie.

1225
01:17:39,057 --> 01:17:41,446
What am l gonna tell her?
She'll want to know...

1226
01:17:41,617 --> 01:17:43,847
about her father.

1227
01:17:44,017 --> 01:17:45,655
What will l say to her?

1228
01:17:45,817 --> 01:17:47,933
What will l tell her?

1229
01:17:48,417 --> 01:17:50,806
I never was married, judge.

1230
01:17:51,017 --> 01:17:53,611
Now, dear. You don't
have to tell her anything.

1231
01:17:53,897 --> 01:17:56,616
All these years
l've kept it from her

1232
01:17:56,777 --> 01:18:00,565
and she must never find out.
Oh no, please...

1233
01:18:00,737 --> 01:18:04,491
- Annie, be quiet.
- No, please.

1234
01:18:04,657 --> 01:18:08,206
- Don't let her find out.
- Annie, control yourself.

1235
01:18:10,857 --> 01:18:14,532
Listen, you think l'd come here
if it wasn't on the level?

1236
01:18:14,697 --> 01:18:17,495
You gotta take my word.
You got to lay off me tonight!

1237
01:18:17,657 --> 01:18:19,295
What else do you want,
the key to the city?

1238
01:18:19,457 --> 01:18:21,687
What's all your gang doing
up at Missouri Martin's?

1239
01:18:21,857 --> 01:18:25,327
- They're having a clambake.
- Nothing you'd be interested in.

1240
01:18:25,577 --> 01:18:27,374
But l can't tell you about it.

1241
01:18:27,537 --> 01:18:30,131
If l could, you'd see how silly
it is to make all this fuss.

1242
01:18:30,297 --> 01:18:32,572
Just lay off me tonight.
I'll do anything.

1243
01:18:32,737 --> 01:18:34,728
I'll help you
find those reporters.

1244
01:18:34,897 --> 01:18:37,616
- That's what you want, isn't it?
- Sure. Where you got them, Dude?

1245
01:18:37,777 --> 01:18:40,530
I ain't got them,
but l send the word round,

1246
01:18:40,697 --> 01:18:43,655
those reporters will be back
at their desks tomorrow.

1247
01:18:44,017 --> 01:18:47,453
Just call off your men
till 12 o'clock tonight.

1248
01:18:47,617 --> 01:18:49,972
Sorry, Dude. Can't do business.

1249
01:18:50,377 --> 01:18:53,608
You'll have a police escort
until those reporters show up.

1250
01:18:53,777 --> 01:18:56,655
If that's the way you feel,
l'll tell ya something.

1251
01:18:56,817 --> 01:18:59,411
You're right!
I have got those reporters.

1252
01:18:59,657 --> 01:19:01,852
But they're not
going to show up, see?

1253
01:19:02,017 --> 01:19:05,134
They won't show up until
l'm good and ready to produce 'em.

1254
01:19:05,297 --> 01:19:10,212
- Now will you do business?
- Sure, we'll do business.

1255
01:19:12,537 --> 01:19:13,606
Mac.

1256
01:19:14,137 --> 01:19:16,128
So you've got the reporters, huh?

1257
01:19:16,297 --> 01:19:20,051
I thought so.
Arrest these two guys.

1258
01:19:20,217 --> 01:19:22,048
This won't do you any good.

1259
01:19:22,217 --> 01:19:25,015
You can always do business
with the Police Department.

1260
01:19:25,177 --> 01:19:26,815
<i>- Yes, sir?
- Get me the Mayor on the phone.</i>

1261
01:19:26,977 --> 01:19:29,332
I don't think you can get him.
He's got a party for the Governor.

1262
01:19:29,497 --> 01:19:32,409
I'll get him when he finds out
it's about the reporters.

1263
01:19:32,577 --> 01:19:35,569
I wouldn't be surprised if
the Mayor made a deal with you.

1264
01:19:35,737 --> 01:19:37,887
Probably settle for 50 years.

1265
01:19:38,057 --> 01:19:40,810
Don't be a sap, Commissioner.
Why drag the Mayor into this?

1266
01:19:40,977 --> 01:19:42,695
You want those reporters, don't ya?

1267
01:19:43,057 --> 01:19:45,048
The newspapers are making
a sucker out of you.

1268
01:19:45,217 --> 01:19:46,935
Now you can come out on top.

1269
01:19:47,097 --> 01:19:49,531
What? Well, tell him
it's about those reporters. Yes.

1270
01:19:49,697 --> 01:19:51,608
There ain't anything crooked
about this whole thing.

1271
01:19:51,777 --> 01:19:53,847
You'd laugh your head off
if you heard the story.

1272
01:19:54,017 --> 01:19:55,894
Sure, l'm laughing right now.

1273
01:19:56,057 --> 01:19:57,729
- Hello, Chief.
- Wait a minute.

1274
01:19:57,897 --> 01:20:00,127
Before you talk to him,
l'll tell you the whole story.

1275
01:20:00,297 --> 01:20:03,209
You'll think l'm nuts,
but here's the real lowdown.

1276
01:20:03,377 --> 01:20:06,369
Say, you believe
in fairy tales, don't you?

1277
01:20:06,537 --> 01:20:07,652
What?

1278
01:20:08,217 --> 01:20:10,492
No, it's no use.

1279
01:20:11,017 --> 01:20:13,372
I'll hang before l let you
give me the horselaugh.

1280
01:20:13,537 --> 01:20:15,528
Talk to the Mayor,
talk to anybody you want,

1281
01:20:15,697 --> 01:20:18,894
but l'll tell you one thing,
you'll never see those reporters.

1282
01:20:19,057 --> 01:20:22,527
Hello, Chief.
I've got Dave the Dude right here.

1283
01:20:22,777 --> 01:20:27,089
Yes, he admits having
the three reporters.

1284
01:20:27,257 --> 01:20:29,566
He does, huh?
Call the Governor.

1285
01:20:29,737 --> 01:20:30,886
Governor.

1286
01:20:32,937 --> 01:20:35,053
Dave the Dude admits
having the reporters.

1287
01:20:35,217 --> 01:20:37,572
Good!
Have they arrested him yet?

1288
01:20:37,737 --> 01:20:39,728
Sure they've arrested him,
Governor.

1289
01:20:39,897 --> 01:20:41,569
But what will happen now?

1290
01:20:41,737 --> 01:20:44,535
In the morning a bail bond
will get him out again.

1291
01:20:44,697 --> 01:20:47,769
- That's ridiculous.
- It how it works in this town.

1292
01:20:47,937 --> 01:20:49,893
He's got a colossal nerve.

1293
01:20:50,057 --> 01:20:52,332
He can't make any deals
with the Police Department.

1294
01:20:52,497 --> 01:20:55,011
There's an example for you.
He wants to make a deal with us.

1295
01:20:55,177 --> 01:20:57,088
Says if we don't leave him alone
tonight, we'll never see them.

1296
01:20:57,257 --> 01:20:59,134
- That's outrageous!
- Don't get excited, Governor.

1297
01:20:59,297 --> 01:21:01,572
It's the customary procedure.

1298
01:21:01,897 --> 01:21:03,694
Bring Dave the Dude up here.

1299
01:21:03,857 --> 01:21:06,451
Yes, that's exactly what l said.
Bring him up here.

1300
01:21:06,617 --> 01:21:09,177
Don't worry about my guests.
This is more important.

1301
01:21:10,377 --> 01:21:12,937
You gentlemen have freely
criticized this administration.

1302
01:21:13,137 --> 01:21:14,775
Let's see what you can do.

1303
01:21:14,937 --> 01:21:18,612
I'll let you spread him
all over the front pages!

1304
01:21:18,777 --> 01:21:20,893
I'd send a criminal like that
away for life!

1305
01:21:21,057 --> 01:21:22,729
Here's your chance, Governor.

1306
01:21:24,537 --> 01:21:27,370
It was all going to be so simple.

1307
01:21:49,497 --> 01:21:52,489
Ask them if
they believe in fairy tales.

1308
01:21:53,377 --> 01:21:55,095
Look at their skulls.

1309
01:21:56,137 --> 01:21:58,492
It's a rare privilege.

1310
01:21:59,057 --> 01:22:02,094
- It's a rare...
- Stop! Stop, Cheesecake.

1311
01:22:02,257 --> 01:22:04,532
I don't mind tellin' ya
you smell to high heaven.

1312
01:22:04,697 --> 01:22:06,688
Why don't ya learn this
like l told ya?

1313
01:22:06,857 --> 01:22:10,372
- You get worse every time.
- Shakespeare, l'm wore out.

1314
01:22:10,537 --> 01:22:13,415
How can a guy unlax
if he's all wore out?

1315
01:22:13,577 --> 01:22:16,330
Listen, Simon Legree,
we been doin' this for hours.

1316
01:22:16,497 --> 01:22:18,613
The Dude said to
keep practicing, didn't he?

1317
01:22:18,777 --> 01:22:20,893
So, we're going to practice.

1318
01:22:21,057 --> 01:22:22,968
Now everybody. Up on your feet.

1319
01:22:24,177 --> 01:22:25,974
Throw yourself into it!

1320
01:22:26,137 --> 01:22:28,367
Do it like l told ya.

1321
01:22:28,537 --> 01:22:30,971
Close the door, Stuttgart.
Come on, Lefty, get into it.

1322
01:22:31,137 --> 01:22:33,014
Now, the Apple Annie speech.

1323
01:22:33,697 --> 01:22:35,972
Keep on practicing. Don't stop.

1324
01:22:37,577 --> 01:22:38,930
Hello, Dude.

1325
01:22:40,977 --> 01:22:43,650
But Dude, we're all set.
Everyone's been practicing.

1326
01:22:43,817 --> 01:22:45,330
Everybody looks swell.

1327
01:22:49,497 --> 01:22:50,771
Okay, Dude.

1328
01:22:51,377 --> 01:22:53,288
- I'll tell 'em.
- What's the matter?

1329
01:22:53,457 --> 01:22:55,766
- Dude says it's all off.
- It can't be!

1330
01:22:55,937 --> 01:22:58,576
Dude said it was all off.
Everyone send back the suits.

1331
01:22:59,257 --> 01:23:00,815
What a break for Annie.

1332
01:23:00,977 --> 01:23:03,286
You try to do something decent
and they won't let ya.

1333
01:23:03,457 --> 01:23:04,776
Poor Annie.

1334
01:23:18,097 --> 01:23:20,086
Mother...

1335
01:23:21,617 --> 01:23:22,732
Mother...

1336
01:23:25,257 --> 01:23:27,134
ls there anything wrong?

1337
01:23:27,737 --> 01:23:30,729
I heard the Count saying
there won't be any reception.

1338
01:23:30,897 --> 01:23:32,535
Isn't anybody coming?

1339
01:23:36,057 --> 01:23:37,888
My baby.

1340
01:23:39,937 --> 01:23:42,610
- Louise, darling?
- Yes, Mother.

1341
01:23:42,777 --> 01:23:47,646
If anything should happen,
you'd never hate your mother?

1342
01:23:47,817 --> 01:23:50,695
Don't say things like that.

1343
01:23:51,217 --> 01:23:53,367
Please don't say things like that.

1344
01:23:55,697 --> 01:23:58,211
Is the Count in the drawing room?

1345
01:23:58,457 --> 01:23:59,492
Yes.

1346
01:24:08,977 --> 01:24:12,652
Annie, where are you going?
Where are you going?

1347
01:24:40,217 --> 01:24:41,855
Count Romero,

1348
01:24:42,457 --> 01:24:46,245
l want a few moments
to talk with you.

1349
01:24:55,097 --> 01:24:59,454
There's nothing more in the world
l want more than

1350
01:24:59,617 --> 01:25:04,088
for Louise to marry your son.
He's a dear boy.

1351
01:25:04,697 --> 01:25:08,975
Louise loves him,
loves him dearly.

1352
01:25:09,497 --> 01:25:13,331
And l'm quite sure
he loves her, too.

1353
01:25:17,577 --> 01:25:20,137
Ever since she was born,

1354
01:25:20,457 --> 01:25:23,767
l've had but one thought
in my mind,

1355
01:25:24,177 --> 01:25:26,008
her happiness.

1356
01:25:27,977 --> 01:25:30,491
When she wrote and told me

1357
01:25:31,297 --> 01:25:34,414
she found someone she loved,

1358
01:25:35,497 --> 01:25:39,206
l think l was
the happiest mother in the world.

1359
01:25:40,017 --> 01:25:41,575
Count Romero,

1360
01:25:42,537 --> 01:25:44,573
you came over here

1361
01:25:44,737 --> 01:25:47,888
to find out something
about her...

1362
01:25:48,497 --> 01:25:52,536
about her family,
about me.

1363
01:25:52,697 --> 01:25:54,813
I don't blame you.

1364
01:25:55,337 --> 01:25:57,532
You had a perfect right.

1365
01:25:58,017 --> 01:26:00,770
You knew nothing about us.

1366
01:26:01,977 --> 01:26:05,811
It would be terrible if,
after they were married,

1367
01:26:05,977 --> 01:26:08,013
you came to find out that...

1368
01:26:10,057 --> 01:26:15,689
her mother was someone
you would be ashamed of.

1369
01:26:17,137 --> 01:26:22,336
Someone even she
would be ashamed of.

1370
01:26:22,497 --> 01:26:25,534
That's silly, Mother. That's silly.

1371
01:26:26,657 --> 01:26:30,696
That's why l wanted to have
this talk with you, Count Romero.

1372
01:26:32,257 --> 01:26:36,375
I wanted to tell you
all about us.

1373
01:26:37,977 --> 01:26:39,695
I want to tell you...

1374
01:27:09,577 --> 01:27:11,772
His Honor, the Mayor!

1375
01:27:19,517 --> 01:27:22,554
Go ahead, Mayor. Do your stuff.
It's your idea.

1376
01:27:35,557 --> 01:27:38,071
My dear Mrs. Manville,
so good to see you again!

1377
01:27:38,237 --> 01:27:41,354
The last time was at
your very lovely party

1378
01:27:41,517 --> 01:27:44,554
at Briarwood.
I'll never forget it. Brilliant.

1379
01:27:44,757 --> 01:27:47,317
And this, l assume,
is your very charming daughter.

1380
01:27:49,757 --> 01:27:52,749
Count Romero and his son, Carlos.

1381
01:27:52,917 --> 01:27:55,226
How do you do?
Welcome to our city.

1382
01:27:55,397 --> 01:27:59,276
I recognize you at once, Mayor.
I've seen you in the newsreels.

1383
01:27:59,437 --> 01:28:01,905
- Thank you.
- Delighted, madam.

1384
01:28:18,637 --> 01:28:21,595
- It's a miracle.
- Two miracles.

1385
01:28:23,557 --> 01:28:24,831
The Governor.

1386
01:28:28,477 --> 01:28:31,514
His Excellency, The Governor!

1387
01:28:39,037 --> 01:28:41,187
What did you say
old Apple Annie's name was?

1388
01:28:41,357 --> 01:28:43,587
Mrs. E. Worthington Manville.

1389
01:28:43,757 --> 01:28:45,827
- Goodness sake, don't forget it!
- No, no.

1390
01:28:51,357 --> 01:28:52,870
Mrs. Manville,

1391
01:28:53,077 --> 01:28:55,591
l can't tell you
what a pleasure,

1392
01:28:55,757 --> 01:28:57,793
what a privilege it is for us,

1393
01:28:57,957 --> 01:29:00,710
to be here tonight
at your wonderful reception.

1394
01:29:01,837 --> 01:29:03,953
Your charming daughter, l presume?

1395
01:29:44,357 --> 01:29:47,588
The Governor's taking us
down to the boat. Not bad, huh?

1396
01:29:48,557 --> 01:29:52,516
As a kid, they had a tough time
making me believe in Santa Claus.

1397
01:29:56,757 --> 01:29:58,713
Look, Father. A police escort!

1398
01:29:58,877 --> 01:30:01,072
That's more than they do
for us in Valencia.

1399
01:30:01,237 --> 01:30:03,705
You are very influential,
my friend.

1400
01:30:03,877 --> 01:30:06,027
This? Nothing at all.
Nothing, l assure you.

1401
01:30:06,197 --> 01:30:08,472
An admirable woman.
A delightful experience.

1402
01:30:08,637 --> 01:30:10,514
Made me feel 10 years younger.

1403
01:30:12,157 --> 01:30:14,387
I suppose, Governor,
now that you're in town,

1404
01:30:14,557 --> 01:30:16,866
you'll follow up that
investigation down at city hall.

1405
01:30:17,037 --> 01:30:19,915
No, l think we've been
a little bit harsh with them.

1406
01:30:20,077 --> 01:30:23,513
I guess l've been a bit impatient
with the administration, Mayor.

1407
01:30:23,677 --> 01:30:27,067
- Sorry about my attitude tonight.
- That's all right.

1408
01:30:27,637 --> 01:30:30,197
I must remember to call up
the Commissioner tomorrow.

1409
01:30:30,357 --> 01:30:32,348
I've been making his life miserable.

1410
01:30:32,517 --> 01:30:35,350
You boys gotta excuse me
if l get a bit tough on you

1411
01:30:35,517 --> 01:30:38,270
one in a while.
I know you're doing your best.

1412
01:30:38,437 --> 01:30:40,155
Okay, Commissioner, okay.

1413
01:30:40,317 --> 01:30:42,831
That's the way you'll write
the story. Got that clear?

1414
01:30:42,997 --> 01:30:44,316
What about us being kidnapped?

1415
01:30:44,477 --> 01:30:48,186
Who said you were kidnapped?
You were on a drunk, understand?

1416
01:30:48,357 --> 01:30:49,316
Drunk?

1417
01:30:49,317 --> 01:30:52,707
- You're passing up on this story?
- You were out on a drunk!

1418
01:31:22,917 --> 01:31:25,954
Hold onto it!

1419
01:31:37,157 --> 01:31:38,351
Goodbye.

1420
01:31:39,117 --> 01:31:40,869
Goodbye. Goodbye, Mother.
