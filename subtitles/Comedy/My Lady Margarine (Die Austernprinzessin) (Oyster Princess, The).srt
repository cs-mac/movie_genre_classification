1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,420
This is the time that we have to think of our royalty future.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,960
With the royal wedding ceremony for the crown prince.

3
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:17,130
So, this girl is Prince Inn's fiance.

4
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:20,060
Would you marry me?

5
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,700
I am sorry about that you proposed to me.

6
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:37,000
If you talk too much, you will get in trouble.

7
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,030
Such a silly prince! You think you can intimidate me?

8
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,700
I am not intimidate you.

9
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:44,200
If you don't believe me. Try then!

10
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,630
Being a cheerful and sweet person sometimes

11
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,430
not aggressive and unruly

12
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,330
I've always been like this.

13
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:39,900
I've met you who is a girl-heartthrob.

14
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:42,600
I've known you that you are cold-hearted

15
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,900
but also lovely sometimes.

16
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:50,130
It's so weird that you come to change my world.

17
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:54,500
You make me tremble.

18
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,960
Is this love?

19
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,500
Are we on the same page?

20
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:04,300
Do you feel like me when we are near?

21
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:10,600
Please tell me that beneath such a dreamy

22
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,360
that means I love you.

23
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:23,640

24
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,260
This couple seem to get along well.

25
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,000
Queen mother...

26
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,460
Take it easy, they are going to marry.

27
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:42,560
He seems really want to know that who will be his bride.

28
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,730
I didn't expect to meet the prince there.

29
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,760
How about that family?

30
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,600
You seem like you work so hard.

31
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,100
You should let it be.

32
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,630
Don't stress.

33
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,830
Ok.

34
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,960
But... do it softly please.

35
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,730
P'Put!!

36
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,500
Why you don't pay a mortgage?!

37
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,330
It's several months!

38
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,200
Where's the money?

39
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,060
Mom!

40
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:32,900
We could talk outside. There is customer.

41
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,600
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,730
Never mind.

43
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:47,000
But stop hit me and you could talk.

44
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:49,460
No, I can't.

45
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,430
Let's talk later.

46
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,300
No, I can't wait.

47
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,760
This is the big problem!

48
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:00,430
Our house will seize definitely.

49
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:03,930
You probably open the massage shop at roadside there.

50
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,030
Calm down.

51
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,200
His muscle is still hurt.

52
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:15,500
P'Put!! Why you don't care about anything!!

53
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:21,960
I really ask you, there were many customer last month. Where is the money?!

54
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:31,430
They came here because they were hurt, so I didn't even ask them about money.

55
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,200
I saw them feeling better. I was very happy.

56
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,130
Have you ever thought that anyone will help us?

57
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,960
What should I do?

58
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:50,200
I have idea.

59
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,430
I will find more customer.

60
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,900
We have to work more and we will get more money.

61
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:02,430
I will also create a new massage oil recipe and sell it on social media.

62
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:08,500
I have no idea.  You deal it yourself!

63
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:20,800
It's good? You might feel comfortable that why you're falling to sleep like this.

64
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,630
Oh no... I haven't done it yet.

65
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,160
Here you go.

66
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,530
It's still warm. I will give it to you.

67
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,300
Oh... the smell is so good.

68
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:54,300
It's safflower tea.

69
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,600
Really good for your health.

70
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,530
Just 100 baht per pack. Buy 7, get 2 free.

71
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:06,900
I am willing if you want to be a membership with us.

72
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:12,330
I'm not a direct seller. I just suggest you to buy it.

73
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:19,900
I'm sorry because my mom wants more membership.

74
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:27,300
I want to meet your parent, can you tell them for me?

75
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,660
My parent?

76
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:35,100
Sure, you are so lovely. I will tell them. Just a moment please.

77
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,930
Just a second! Don't go anywhere.

78
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:52,730
It seems she is a good girl.

79
00:06:55,260 --> 00:07:00,060
Yes, the fiance is a good girl and lovely as well.

80
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:04,100
Did you tell them?

81
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,660
Yes, Your Majesty.

82
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:16,000
This is symbol necklace of the royalty that the ex-King gave us as evidence for the promise.

83
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,760
I think you will also have it.

84
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,660
- Necklace?
- Yes.

85
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:26,200
Although I've known you that you are really his descendant.

86
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,400
But you have to confirm it with this necklace.

87
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:39,630
It probably be that the ex-royal guard

88
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,860
didn't give it to you.

89
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,700
Because

90
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,000
you ran away from home for so long.

91
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,900
You would like to say that I am a bad son. I don't mind it.

92
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,060
The nacklace.

93
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:06,230
I remembered that my dad ever give me the necklace when Kaning was born.

94
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,530
Where is it now?

95
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,760
Where is it? I forget it.

96
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:16,230
Forget what? You give it to me.

97
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:22,560
Such a rare item like this. I keep it in the safe at the bank.

98
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,030
Yes, you're right! It's in safe at the bank.

99
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,200
Yes.

100
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:35,260
We have to tell this to the fiance.

101
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,160
Wait! Please wait!!!

102
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:42,500
Sit down please, the principal secretary.

103
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,230
Sit down please.

104
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:52,760
I think we should not tell her now. If we do that she might be shock for sure!

105
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:57,130
Like her dad and I now.

106
00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:01,760
Yes! I got shock!

107
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:06,760
Give us the time for tell her a few days.

108
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:12,300
So, 3 days after this. I will come back again.

109
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,400
Don't forget your necklace.

110
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,830
The necklace?

111
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,680
You will come back here within 3 days.

112
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,680
No problem!

113
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:48,360
You are the fiance who is going to marry with Prince Inn.

114
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,640
What?!

115
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,760
Just 3 days left, you will meet the fiance.

116
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,240
I am so excited.

117
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:18,200
Bhutin is going to have a celebration soon.

118
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:32,200
So, do you know about Prince Nakhun and Princess Krissana?

119
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:51,760
It's almost 3 days. He is coming.

120
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,440
Do you remember where it is?

121
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,960
Or you pawn it?

122
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,800
Dad! What are you doing?

123
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,240
I remember it!

124
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,400
Really!!! Where?

125
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,960
On the roof.

126
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:22,440
Dad! Mom! I had a nightmare!

127
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,440
Why??

128
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:31,920
No. It won't happen again. I'm here.

129
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,040
I had dream about none-face prince

130
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:44,440
he imprisoned me at the tower for talisman worship.

131
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,760
Oh dear, it's alright. Everything will be okay.

132
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:56,600
P'Put, don't let her wear your dad's necklace.

133
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,480
You've always had a nightmare when she wears it.

134
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,840
It might be here!

135
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,640
I didn't come for a long time. So messy!

136
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,240
It might be lost.

137
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,680
Don't have a nightmare anymore please!

138
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,160
Mom! I found it!!

139
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,920
Mom!!

140
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,880
I found the nacklace!!

141
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:31,320
Oh, you have prepared this much. Are you ready?

142
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,880
What's matter?

143
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:38,000
If you are ready. Shall we go?

144
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,800
Where are we going?

145
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:48,440
You come here early. I didn't talk to my daughter yet.

146
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:00,040
I thought she already prepared the stuffs. So she'd know about the wedding.

147
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,440
The wedding?

148
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,480
What does it mean?

149
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,200
Is there a secret?

150
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,840
So, I would like to tell her myself.

151
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:21,200
I am a royal principal secretary of the Bureau of the Royal Household of Bhutin.

152
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,520
I would like to tell you that

153
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,640
you are the fiance who is going to marry with Prince Inn

154
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,360
who is the crown prince of Bhutin.

155
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,840
What?!

156
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,400
No one want to tell me!

157
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,680
Dad!

158
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,680
Sit down.

159
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,880
I wanted tell you but it's so sudden.

160
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,880
Dad! Mom!

161
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,040
But I am still too young!

162
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,320
Don't be moody! Calm down!

163
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:15,840
This engagement is from your grandfather and the ex-King made a promise with each other.

164
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,360
You should to do it.

165
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:28,760
What? I don't understand how I can marry with someone who I've not known before.

166
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,760
Impossible!

167
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,680
No, I don't want it. I can't do it!

168
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,960
Kaning!

169
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,480
- I don't do that!
- Calm down!

170
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:46,360
Both of your grandfather and ex-King were best friends. They made promise that they would like to let their descendants marry each other.

171
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,560
But I'm still student.

172
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:57,800
I have my own dream to study in art major. I also want to be a famous cartoonist.

173
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:01,760
Dad! You want me give up on my dream?

174
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:07,360
No way! Moreover, Prince Inn also has...

175
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:12,840
I'm sorry about that you proposed to me.

176
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,960
If you talk too much. You will get in trouble.

177
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,920
What's matter?

178
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,760
Nothing.

179
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,280
But I won't marry him.

180
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,200
Dad! Mom! I don't want to do it.

181
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,200
I won't marry him!

182
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,800
- Kaning!
- No!

183
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,800
Mom? What's wrong with her?

184
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:50,520
So, you really come from Bhutin?

185
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:58,080
I've ever told you but you didn't believe me.

186
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,800
Do you believe me now?

187
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,480
It means all of us have Bhutin blood.

188
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:16,440
Moreover, your sister is Prince Inn's fiance.

189
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:20,040
Oh!!! The fiance!!!

190
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:36,320
It's not true!!

191
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,640
Let's divorce.

192
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,840
You're a nightmare!!

193
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,200
So, we have no money for mortgage?

194
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,080
Keep calm, we will get through it.

195
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,480
You!!

196
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,760
You've always said like this.

197
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,960
I've done this for you all the times.

198
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,920
We are at the end of our rope.

199
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,840
No, not yet. It's not end at all.

200
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:23,200
To let Kaning marry him, isn't the end?

201
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:36,720
I'm not good enough. Our family would be better than this if I worked diligently.

202
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,760
Mom?

203
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,560
Let's divorce.

204
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,200
Let's divorce as you've often asked me.

205
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,520
I will handle the debt myself.

206
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,520
Let Kaning be with you.

207
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,800
And use your lastname.

208
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:16,120
She doesn't need to marry with that promise anymore.

209
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:24,800
Are you sure what you've just said?

210
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:38,040
In the past, I proposed you to divorce.  But you never accept it .

211
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,520
But today...

212
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:47,200
You've said it yourself.

213
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,840
Such a crazy!!!

214
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,480
Think carefully

215
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,400
I will throw it in the towel.

216
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,320
I will stay with friend. Not Indefinite. (Kaning)

217
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:12,440
For the marriage, I need to sleep on it.

218
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:25,920
This is Bhutin's archer athlete. She is so pretty.

219
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,560
Kaning?

220
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,880
If you don't hurry you won't finish your work.

221
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,320
Kaning!!

222
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,440
What?!

223
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,160
Let's go! but where is it?

224
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,960
Kaning, what's wrong with you today?

225
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,200
No, nothing.

226
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:13,840
You!!! Prince Inn is coming!!!

227
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,200
Prince!!! Prince!!!

228
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,680
Look at them!

229
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,680
What the hell they are doing.

230
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,000
Stop!

231
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,600
Prince! Prince!

232
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,600
I think so, they are punching above their wieght.

233
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,480
- He is looking at me? He likes me!
- Nope! He is looking at me.

234
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,680
Hey! Stop!!!

235
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,040
He did it! Because you just splashed the water on his face!

236
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,760
- Don't point at me!
- You know

237
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:48,120
Hi-Class people have always associated with each other. They don't ever make friend with us.

238
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,920
Remember it!! Don't be nonsense!

239
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:54,160
He is looking at me!

240
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:58,080
Stop!!!

241
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,840
Prince, how about Minnie?

242
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,960
Do you still keep in touch?

243
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,240
Please leave me alone for awhile.

244
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,000
Hey! Are you okay?

245
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,120
Inn?  Prince?

246
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,240
You?

247
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,320
Stop!

248
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,600
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Come here.

249
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,720
What's matter, Your Highness?

250
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,080
You can speak informal.

251
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,680
You already know it, did you?

252
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,280
Know what?

253
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,480
No! Such a creepy!

254
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:18,160
Your necklace, what does it mean?

255
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:36,320
I am glad that you wear this necklace.

256
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,880
I also have it.

257
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:03,440
Prince, I need to marry you because of my family.

258
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,800
I hope you don't mind me.

259
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,920
You will go through difficult times.

260
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,840
Would you marry me?

261
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,120
I will take care of you.

262
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,280
Don't do that.

263
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,720
What's wrong with you?

264
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,440
Do you really want to be a princess?

265
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,120
No, I don't.

266
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,800
But you still don't know

267
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,320
what you will face with in the palace.

268
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,080
Such a crazy prince!!!

269
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,520
This is True Insider show.

270
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:47,800
And today we will talk about the hot topic in our social first.

271
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,800
That about Prince Inn who is the popular among women including my partner here also.

272
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:57,720
Yes, It seems like a sad news more than good, P'Put.

273
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:03,920
Because he suddenly came back this time for his royal wedding ceremony.

274
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:12,000
This matter is talk of the town and people also want to know it through mass media and SNS right now.

275
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:18,040
Everyone is talking about this and we will find more details for you.

276
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,600
We have to handle it prematurely.

277
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:49,960
Yes, Your Majesty. I will order the Bureau of the Royal Household handle it immediately.

278
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:56,280
What's wrong? Are you worry about the wedding?

279
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,800
Don't forget it. This is purpose of your grandpa.

280
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,840
And our royalty never break any promises.

281
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,000
Moreover, it's promise that your grandpa gave it to his best friend.

282
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:14,560
We can't deny it! Do you understand?

283
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:22,600
Excuse me, Your Majesty. It's time for your dinner.

284
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,160
Hey! Do you know that Prince Inn is going to marry?

285
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,880
- Screammmmmmmm!!!!
- Unbelievable! Who's that? Where does she live?!!!

286
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,680
- Calm down. This is a hot news now. You will know soon.

287
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,200
Kaning!

288
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,400
I have a hot news to tell you!!

289
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:08,480
You are so overacting like you will be his princess.

290
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,080
What?!

291
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:16,400
His princess?? Don't tell me that you all already know it.

292
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,880
What I should do.

293
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,640
Stop!!

294
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:27,360
Kaning! Don't be nonsense with both of them.

295
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:32,560
So how did you know that he is going to marry?

296
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:42,080
Look here! Who's spread this rumor? This is rumor! It's not true! He is still young. No Way!!!

297
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,320
- He is mine!
- No, he is mine!

298
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,320
He is your? When?

299
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,400
It's just a rumor!!

300
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:52,480
You are right! I'm so upset!

301
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,440
Inn?

302
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,720
About the news, is it true?

303
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:10,600
Did you change your status that just being friends become couple?

304
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,680
I didn't know.

305
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:21,640
When are you going to marry?

306
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,880
Are you spread the rumor?

307
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,360
You really want to be princess, do you?

308
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,680
No, I didn't

309
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,880
But you don't believe me for sure, Your Highness.

310
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,760
I told you don't say 'Your Highness' with me

311
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,760
Why? Your Highness.

312
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:22,400
Your Highness, Sir, Prince...

313
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,120
You don't like it? Your Highness.

314
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,360
Where are you going?

315
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,200
Your Highness.

316
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,240
Your Highness.

317
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,120
I do it quite well today.

318
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,160
How about you, Inn?

319
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,160
I'm going there today.

320
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:40,440
Minnie? Are you ready for this Olympic? How about your confidence?

321
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,680
I am confident.

322
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:48,240
I give all my life for this Olympic.

323
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:54,920
So Bhutin people probably have the first Olympic athlete in history?

324
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,360
Sure, I am very confident.

325
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:03,800
Minnie? Please wait!

326
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,680
You have to work hard.

327
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:16,800
We have many things to do with this comeback.

328
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:23,000
And you must go to the palace often.

329
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,240
