1
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:41,809
Nagging pain

2
00:00:42,729 --> 00:00:44,728
Strange unbearable pain

3
00:00:46,409 --> 00:00:47,608
Fever

4
00:00:48,729 --> 00:00:50,329
Pollution symptoms

5
00:00:51,369 --> 00:00:52,569
Stomach ache

6
00:00:52,769 --> 00:00:55,009
Stomach ache, cause?

7
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:57,088
And cure

8
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:43,129
SUPERCHONDRIAC

9
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:52,689
Happy New Year!

10
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:55,850
Can you hear me?

11
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:57,809
If you can, squeeze my hand.

12
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:21,770
Stay with me, sir.

13
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:25,970
Boulevard des ltaliens, ETA 5 mins.

14
00:02:39,971 --> 00:02:40,890
Go, go!

15
00:02:45,451 --> 00:02:46,490
Easy!

16
00:02:46,611 --> 00:02:48,050
- Secure him.
- Move it!

17
00:02:48,211 --> 00:02:50,890
Romain Faubert, 39.
Intense pain, chest and left arm.

18
00:02:51,051 --> 00:02:52,850
Tachycardia, hyperventilated.

19
00:02:53,011 --> 00:02:53,850
Now stable.

20
00:02:54,011 --> 00:02:55,090
- How long?
- 45 mins.

21
00:02:55,211 --> 00:02:57,210
Let's get blood work,
an EKG and MRI.

22
00:02:57,411 --> 00:02:59,330
Potassium and sodium as needed.

23
00:03:08,691 --> 00:03:10,731
- I can't see anything.
- Me neither.

24
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:13,530
Nothing abnormal.
Who brought him in?

25
00:03:13,691 --> 00:03:14,890
15th District EMT's.

26
00:03:15,052 --> 00:03:16,971
Let me see their medical sheet.

27
00:03:18,611 --> 00:03:19,170
Nothing.

28
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:22,731
No alcohol in his blood.
I don't get it.

29
00:03:22,891 --> 00:03:24,490
There's a spot there, look.

30
00:03:24,652 --> 00:03:25,611
- Where?
- There!

31
00:03:25,771 --> 00:03:27,730
Lower left lung. Very worrisome.

32
00:03:27,851 --> 00:03:30,810
That's no spot.
It's the lower part of the diaphragm.

33
00:03:31,051 --> 00:03:32,130
You need glasses.

34
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:33,490
Hey, watch it!

35
00:03:33,611 --> 00:03:35,250
What's your name, Doctor?

36
00:03:36,412 --> 00:03:38,091
No, I'm not a doctor.

37
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:38,891
A patient!

38
00:03:39,131 --> 00:03:40,931
Of course. What's he doing here?

39
00:03:41,092 --> 00:03:42,450
That's me in the picture.

40
00:03:42,612 --> 00:03:45,011
I heard you talking about me,
I came in.

41
00:03:45,132 --> 00:03:47,610
This isn't his 1st time.
He's a sick individual.

42
00:03:47,932 --> 00:03:49,890
That's why I'm here. I'm very sick.

43
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:52,410
Beat it.

44
00:03:52,852 --> 00:03:54,731
Out! Kick him the hell out!

45
00:03:55,452 --> 00:03:57,891
Don't touch me.
No nosocomial infections!

46
00:03:58,092 --> 00:03:59,010
Don't touch me.

47
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:00,210
Get him out.

48
00:04:01,612 --> 00:04:02,891
Put some gloves on!

49
00:04:09,932 --> 00:04:11,811
You gave them my cell number?

50
00:04:12,092 --> 00:04:15,251
First one I thought of.
I mean, you're my friend.

51
00:04:15,452 --> 00:04:18,211
When the nurse asked
if they should call my family,

52
00:04:18,372 --> 00:04:20,491
I saw you,
bathed in a glowing halo.

53
00:04:20,612 --> 00:04:22,531
Look at me. No glowing halo.

54
00:04:22,652 --> 00:04:25,051
I'm not family
and we're done as friends.

55
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:27,251
It's been 18 years.

56
00:04:27,372 --> 00:04:30,171
18 too many!
We tried, it doesn't work. Period.

57
00:04:30,332 --> 00:04:32,171
I'm done as your doctor, too.

58
00:04:32,612 --> 00:04:33,931
You don't mean that.

59
00:04:35,012 --> 00:04:35,692
No, Dimitri!

60
00:04:36,492 --> 00:04:38,212
Wait, you can't just drop me!

61
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:40,171
Ls my heart condition my fault?

62
00:04:40,373 --> 00:04:42,011
Are you putting me on?

63
00:04:42,212 --> 00:04:44,051
Want a good reason
to be in an ER?

64
00:04:44,252 --> 00:04:46,091
- They tried to kiss me.
- For New Year's!

65
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:48,292
- It's disgusting!
- It's the custom!

66
00:04:48,452 --> 00:04:51,371
The custom is disgusting.
Kissing can't spread disease?

67
00:04:51,533 --> 00:04:54,052
It can be a factor
in germ transmission, sure.

68
00:04:54,212 --> 00:04:56,171
In the midst of a flu epidemic!

69
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,812
There are germs everywhere.
You must stop...

70
00:05:00,012 --> 00:05:01,212
What's that fur coat?

71
00:05:01,932 --> 00:05:03,172
It's not mine.

72
00:05:03,373 --> 00:05:05,731
I just remember
being at your place...

73
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:07,732
Cheers.

74
00:05:11,773 --> 00:05:13,411
- Nice party.
- You're funny.

75
00:05:13,573 --> 00:05:15,292
- Why?
- You're pretend-relaxed.

76
00:05:15,413 --> 00:05:17,332
I'm not much
on New Year's parties.

77
00:05:17,492 --> 00:05:19,092
- So why come?
- I was invited.

78
00:05:21,293 --> 00:05:23,052
You keep checking your watch?

79
00:05:23,213 --> 00:05:25,892
It's not you.
I just need to leave before 12.

80
00:05:26,372 --> 00:05:28,452
You get gray hair at midnight?

81
00:05:29,293 --> 00:05:31,252
I don't want to kiss or be kissed.

82
00:05:31,413 --> 00:05:34,772
All the bacteria you pass along
in kissing... Horrible.

83
00:05:35,093 --> 00:05:38,292
- Never thought of that.
- Think about it. I should know.

84
00:05:38,413 --> 00:05:41,052
I'm an online
medical dictionary photographer.

85
00:05:41,213 --> 00:05:42,972
- Doctoweb. Heard of it?
- No.

86
00:05:44,133 --> 00:05:46,972
Well, I... I'm going.
I need more champagne.

87
00:05:47,093 --> 00:05:48,332
I need a drink

88
00:05:48,533 --> 00:05:50,132
to forget this conversation.

89
00:05:53,613 --> 00:05:54,612
- Cute, right?
- Very.

90
00:05:54,733 --> 00:05:56,333
Don't leave her alone. Go!

91
00:05:56,493 --> 00:05:57,972
- Ready!
- Ready for what?

92
00:05:58,453 --> 00:06:00,092
- Almost midnight.
- No!

93
00:06:02,214 --> 00:06:03,132
Calm down, Romain.

94
00:06:31,413 --> 00:06:33,493
No! Stand clear!
Don't kiss him!

95
00:06:37,614 --> 00:06:39,493
- Stand clear!
- Call emergency.

96
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:42,733
Dimitri, forgive me.

97
00:06:42,894 --> 00:06:45,413
Next time I'll be good.
You'll be proud of me.

98
00:06:45,573 --> 00:06:47,132
There is no next time. Bye.

99
00:06:47,294 --> 00:06:49,453
- Drop me off?
- I'm a doctor, not a driver.

100
00:06:49,614 --> 00:06:52,853
You can't leave a friend
alone in the cold on New Year's.

101
00:06:53,014 --> 00:06:54,093
Our friendship's over.

102
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:56,253
Find a woman,
maybe she'll drive you.

103
00:06:56,854 --> 00:06:58,573
That's a stupid thing to say.

104
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:01,893
Unlock the door.

105
00:07:02,094 --> 00:07:03,373
Dimitri! Open the door!

106
00:07:03,574 --> 00:07:06,013
I beg you, Dimitri.
For the love of God.

107
00:07:06,214 --> 00:07:07,093
No! Wait!

108
00:07:36,574 --> 00:07:38,973
A bottle of hand sanitizer, please.

109
00:07:39,134 --> 00:07:40,293
Quickly.

110
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:44,454
Three euros fifty.

111
00:07:45,094 --> 00:07:48,774
Could you pour some on my hands?
Drenched in bacteria. Horrible.

112
00:07:48,934 --> 00:07:49,533
You do it.

113
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:52,734
If I touch it, I'll contaminate it.
It'll be useless

114
00:07:52,855 --> 00:07:55,494
because the bottle
will be crawling with germs.

115
00:07:57,855 --> 00:07:59,534
Thanks. Go ahead, go.

116
00:08:07,534 --> 00:08:09,454
Very attractive pharmacy.

117
00:08:10,135 --> 00:08:13,054
Any hot new medicines
I can get pre-approval for?

118
00:08:13,215 --> 00:08:14,614
To treat what condition?

119
00:08:14,775 --> 00:08:16,574
Oh, a little of everything.

120
00:08:18,095 --> 00:08:20,534
I can't stand
these New Year's maniacs.

121
00:08:21,015 --> 00:08:22,134
I heard that.

122
00:08:22,295 --> 00:08:23,814
I'm not a maniac.

123
00:08:24,015 --> 00:08:25,534
Right, I noticed.

124
00:08:30,455 --> 00:08:32,534
Jacques, Eva. Stay for a nightcap?

125
00:08:32,735 --> 00:08:35,174
- Who was that madman?
- A patient. Complicated.

126
00:08:35,335 --> 00:08:37,694
- Sorry about your eye.
- Not as sorry as I am.

127
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,615
Doctor, get home safe.

128
00:08:41,415 --> 00:08:43,174
Dimitri, I can't find my fur.

129
00:08:43,335 --> 00:08:45,614
A white fur coat,
with two brooches?

130
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:47,654
Right! it was in the bedroom.

131
00:08:47,816 --> 00:08:49,414
It's mink! Worth a fortune!

132
00:08:49,775 --> 00:08:51,415
Haven't seen it. Sorry.

133
00:08:53,255 --> 00:08:54,574
What a night!

134
00:08:54,776 --> 00:08:58,454
- Why invite that psycho?
- He was alone for New Year's.

135
00:08:58,655 --> 00:09:01,334
I took pity on him.
Not a psycho. Hypochondriac.

136
00:09:01,575 --> 00:09:03,254
- Defending him?
- I made a mistake.

137
00:09:03,455 --> 00:09:05,535
That's clear to everyone,
except you.

138
00:09:05,696 --> 00:09:09,655
I want him to meet someone.
Then he'll finally leave me in peace.

139
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:11,295
Thanks! Glad to hear it.

140
00:09:11,456 --> 00:09:12,975
Sorry, didn't see you there.

141
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,015
I didn't see her there.

142
00:09:16,175 --> 00:09:18,094
Nice idea. Worked out great.

143
00:09:18,215 --> 00:09:21,454
I'm not seeing him again.
It's my New Year's resolution.

144
00:09:26,296 --> 00:09:28,455
- What is that?
- Guess.

145
00:09:28,696 --> 00:09:31,054
Who would stash illegals here
at 2 AM?

146
00:09:31,895 --> 00:09:32,615
Anna!

147
00:09:41,576 --> 00:09:42,895
Anna, no.

148
00:09:43,176 --> 00:09:44,455
It's all good. Fine.

149
00:09:44,696 --> 00:09:47,975
Nina's back from skiing in 2 days.
The answer is no.

150
00:09:53,616 --> 00:09:54,655
Likewise. Goodbye.

151
00:09:54,776 --> 00:09:58,055
No, he's thanking you
for letting them stay.

152
00:09:59,816 --> 00:10:01,015
Why not your place?

153
00:10:01,336 --> 00:10:02,855
Guillaume and I had a fight.

154
00:10:03,016 --> 00:10:05,295
- Deal with it.
- But don't bother you?

155
00:10:05,457 --> 00:10:07,256
- Anna!
- Right, don't bother me!

156
00:10:07,776 --> 00:10:09,896
You're both hopelessly middle-class!

157
00:10:10,056 --> 00:10:13,575
Your architect husband,
your big suburban house...

158
00:10:13,737 --> 00:10:14,535
Nora, come on.

159
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:18,135
When those homeless wetbacks get you
into trouble, don't complain!

160
00:10:18,336 --> 00:10:20,456
They're not homeless.
They're cousins.

161
00:10:20,937 --> 00:10:23,096
Political refugees of Cherkistan.

162
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:25,055
Not all Cherkistanis are cousins.

163
00:10:25,216 --> 00:10:28,336
The least you could do is ask
before coming here.

164
00:10:28,497 --> 00:10:31,856
I was going to. Then I saw
the bombing on Google alert.

165
00:10:32,016 --> 00:10:33,455
- I was swamped!
- Bombing?

166
00:10:33,657 --> 00:10:35,216
You haven't even heard.

167
00:10:35,376 --> 00:10:37,295
A raid in the southern mountains.

168
00:10:37,497 --> 00:10:39,695
The state located
the main rebel camp.

169
00:10:39,936 --> 00:10:40,775
My God!

170
00:10:40,937 --> 00:10:43,376
Sarcasm!
When Anton Miroslav may be dead!

171
00:11:03,657 --> 00:11:05,096
Why would you say that?

172
00:11:05,337 --> 00:11:07,216
Because we're tired!

173
00:11:09,177 --> 00:11:11,616
I want them to shut up.
I want them to go.

174
00:11:12,257 --> 00:11:15,096
Dimitri,
you have no political conscience.

175
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:17,656
And you're in denial
about your roots.

176
00:11:17,857 --> 00:11:18,736
You're hopeless.

177
00:11:18,897 --> 00:11:20,896
We've been French for 3 generations.

178
00:11:21,057 --> 00:11:22,456
So Grandpa was a Zvenka.

179
00:11:22,657 --> 00:11:24,696
Doesn't make us
part of the revolution!

180
00:11:24,857 --> 00:11:26,856
You call yourself a humanitarian.

181
00:11:27,857 --> 00:11:29,736
I'm a non-practicing altruist.

182
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:30,777
Very funny.

183
00:11:36,298 --> 00:11:39,336
- Happy New Year, fascists!
- Same to you, working class hero!

184
00:12:05,857 --> 00:12:06,936
Woman of my dreams?

185
00:13:08,298 --> 00:13:08,977
Not busking.

186
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,657
- Incredible!
- I'm not performing!

187
00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:14,578
How was New Year's
at your doctor's?

188
00:13:14,738 --> 00:13:16,177
Let's not talk about it.

189
00:13:16,298 --> 00:13:19,138
- And your party?
- A blast. Should've come.

190
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:23,017
Hello, excuse me.
I'm scheduled for an MRI.

191
00:13:23,179 --> 00:13:25,537
Fourth floor left.
Elevator's right there.

192
00:13:26,059 --> 00:13:26,857
Thank you.

193
00:13:27,619 --> 00:13:28,618
Don't mention it.

194
00:13:29,258 --> 00:13:30,697
Can't wish him
a happy new year.

195
00:13:32,018 --> 00:13:33,577
- Happy New Year.
- How are you?

196
00:13:33,739 --> 00:13:35,377
A little cold, but I'm OK.

197
00:13:35,498 --> 00:13:36,378
Really?

198
00:13:36,499 --> 00:13:38,658
And you get prettier all the time!

199
00:13:38,858 --> 00:13:39,538
Nice of you.

200
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,778
- See you later?
- All right.

201
00:13:44,499 --> 00:13:45,378
Stings, huh?

202
00:13:45,579 --> 00:13:46,778
A little, yeah.

203
00:13:46,939 --> 00:13:49,098
You got to chill
with the germ thing.

204
00:13:49,259 --> 00:13:50,218
I will.

205
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,899
Hi Véronique, happy New Year.

206
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,978
Romain Faubert! How are you?

207
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,859
Not great, I'm here.

208
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:44,858
Here again.

209
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:53,258
- The waiting room's so crowded.
- Always, after the holiday.

210
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,578
Mind if I wait here?

211
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,219
Yes, I mind.

212
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:58,939
Bitch.

213
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,099
Constant stress.

214
00:15:02,259 --> 00:15:03,579
Dimitri, I'm very ill.

215
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,619
Get out. I have a waiting room.
Véronique!

216
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,219
An emergency.

217
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:10,499
Go through my damn secretary!
Out of my office!

218
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,419
Excuse me.

219
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,739
You said you were feeling
very stressed out?

220
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,379
There!

221
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:29,259
Excuse me, you shouldn't touch
those 90's magazines.

222
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,539
Crawling with germs and skin rashes.

223
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:34,860
Think of all the sick people
turning pages, doing this.

224
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,579
Here.

225
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,980
Waiting rooms are a doctor's way
of increasing clientele.

226
00:15:47,101 --> 00:15:49,020
The doctor is the one waiting

227
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,859
for all our germs
to spread to all his patients.

228
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:59,139
I said I wouldn't see you again.
What is it? Hurry up.

229
00:15:59,781 --> 00:16:02,739
Could you order a tiny ultra-sound
for over here?

230
00:16:02,941 --> 00:16:04,539
Go work out, stop bothering me!

231
00:16:04,941 --> 00:16:08,259
You're being unkind.
I'm your most loyal patient.

232
00:16:08,421 --> 00:16:09,180
And the healthiest!

233
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,900
Sure! I'm careful,
and I have a good doctor.

234
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,780
Listen, Romain.

235
00:16:15,901 --> 00:16:19,260
I do volunteer work.
I see suffering, real suffering.

236
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:22,460
If I took you on a mission once,
you'd stop complaining.

237
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:23,780
I'll stop.

238
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,780
That would be a miracle.
Come on, get out.

239
00:16:27,221 --> 00:16:30,220
I got you a present,
to apologize for the party.

240
00:16:30,341 --> 00:16:31,740
You shouldn't have.

241
00:16:32,621 --> 00:16:34,420
You were so nice to invite me.

242
00:16:35,901 --> 00:16:37,660
For my friend Dimitri Thank you

243
00:16:39,341 --> 00:16:41,620
- You don't like it?
- That's not it.

244
00:16:42,941 --> 00:16:44,980
Such a fine gift wasn't necessary.

245
00:16:47,101 --> 00:16:48,420
It's nice of you.

246
00:16:49,901 --> 00:16:51,460
I'll take your blood pressure.

247
00:16:54,781 --> 00:16:55,940
I'll go, you're busy.

248
00:17:00,182 --> 00:17:01,621
It was nice of him.

249
00:17:02,141 --> 00:17:03,140
After you.

250
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:11,180
He's not contagious.

251
00:17:15,381 --> 00:17:17,900
Stand here in the middle,
face forward.

252
00:17:18,381 --> 00:17:20,421
Where do you have the most blotches?

253
00:17:20,621 --> 00:17:22,060
Chest and neck.

254
00:17:22,181 --> 00:17:24,981
Could you open your shirt, please?

255
00:17:25,142 --> 00:17:26,860
And head nice and high.

256
00:17:27,862 --> 00:17:28,821
Like this?

257
00:17:33,821 --> 00:17:36,381
How do you catch
pityriasis versicolor?

258
00:17:36,502 --> 00:17:37,780
Hot, humid places.

259
00:17:37,982 --> 00:17:38,661
Africa?

260
00:17:38,861 --> 00:17:41,301
Much closer.
Public swimming pools.

261
00:17:41,462 --> 00:17:43,141
A fungus. That's all I got.

262
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:45,301
- From the foot bath?
- I don't know.

263
00:17:45,461 --> 00:17:46,381
Profile, please.

264
00:17:46,702 --> 00:17:48,741
The foot bath
is a revolting invention.

265
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:49,981
- The what?
- Foot bath.

266
00:17:50,142 --> 00:17:52,061
Those disinfectant pools for feet.

267
00:17:52,222 --> 00:17:53,981
They force you to walk in it,

268
00:17:54,142 --> 00:17:56,461
to be sure you'll get
every last germ.

269
00:17:56,662 --> 00:17:58,381
Your other profile, please.

270
00:17:59,422 --> 00:18:00,381
Here.

271
00:18:01,342 --> 00:18:02,021
Why?

272
00:18:02,182 --> 00:18:04,061
Your headache.
You keep doing this.

273
00:18:09,742 --> 00:18:10,821
Here man, thanks.

274
00:18:14,382 --> 00:18:17,741
That's the secret of happiness.
Live for the moment. OK?

275
00:18:17,862 --> 00:18:18,861
Fantastic, Marc!

276
00:18:19,023 --> 00:18:20,981
I can't believe
I didn't go out before!

277
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,301
I'm making up for lost time!

278
00:18:23,463 --> 00:18:24,941
I love it! Thanks, dude!

279
00:18:25,102 --> 00:18:26,381
No problem, man!

280
00:18:26,703 --> 00:18:29,582
Who rules here? We do!

281
00:18:31,422 --> 00:18:33,941
Go. I got the blood test ready.
Don't worry.

282
00:18:37,582 --> 00:18:39,461
- Romain!
- Manon!

283
00:18:39,862 --> 00:18:41,822
- You come here often?
- My first time.

284
00:18:41,982 --> 00:18:44,782
That's funny. Me, too!
Let me recite a poem.

285
00:18:44,943 --> 00:18:46,661
- No, no poem!
- Yeah, a poem.

286
00:18:46,902 --> 00:18:48,742
- A what?
- A poem!

287
00:18:52,223 --> 00:18:53,861
He wants to recite a poem.

288
00:18:55,062 --> 00:18:57,182
Wow, that was so masterful.

289
00:18:57,342 --> 00:18:59,902
So masterful. You're my hero.

290
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:06,461
Marc?

291
00:19:08,862 --> 00:19:11,782
What is it, the cocktail?
I drank the same one!

292
00:19:11,983 --> 00:19:13,782
Step aside. We have no time!

293
00:19:13,983 --> 00:19:16,422
But I drank the same cocktail!
The same one!

294
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:17,902
Help me!

295
00:19:32,063 --> 00:19:34,062
Sorry, I gave your number again.

296
00:19:34,223 --> 00:19:35,502
That's all right.

297
00:19:36,623 --> 00:19:38,862
I know that doctor.
Careful, he sucks.

298
00:19:40,264 --> 00:19:42,822
- Romain, it's not good news.
- Marc?

299
00:19:43,063 --> 00:19:45,702
Sorry, it's over for your friend.

300
00:19:45,863 --> 00:19:47,142
No way.

301
00:19:47,303 --> 00:19:48,783
It's over. Marc is dead.

302
00:19:52,543 --> 00:19:55,302
You killed him!
Public hospitals! What did you do?

303
00:19:55,663 --> 00:19:57,783
He was gone
when he got to the ER.

304
00:19:57,943 --> 00:19:59,463
It was an aneurism.

305
00:19:59,783 --> 00:20:01,782
A massive cerebral hemorrhage.

306
00:20:01,984 --> 00:20:05,502
He had lots of aspirin in his blood,
which sped up the process.

307
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:07,902
Holy shit!

308
00:20:08,704 --> 00:20:09,783
What is it?

309
00:20:31,423 --> 00:20:32,463
Hello.

310
00:20:35,064 --> 00:20:36,063
You all right?

311
00:20:38,544 --> 00:20:40,503
Easy, easy.
It'll be all right.

312
00:20:41,384 --> 00:20:42,423
It'll be all right.

313
00:20:42,584 --> 00:20:44,263
Come on, it's all right.

314
00:20:53,584 --> 00:20:54,463
What's that?

315
00:20:54,624 --> 00:20:58,103
Eastern European disinfectant.
Genuine Cherkistan, it picks you up.

316
00:20:58,264 --> 00:20:59,383
When in mourning,

317
00:20:59,584 --> 00:21:01,463
drink and laugh.

318
00:21:01,624 --> 00:21:02,944
To let it go. Come on.

319
00:21:03,104 --> 00:21:04,583
As Grandpa would say, kvanya!

320
00:21:06,024 --> 00:21:07,703
I murdered my best friend.

321
00:21:07,865 --> 00:21:09,863
Stop that, you didn't murder him.

322
00:21:10,064 --> 00:21:11,464
But stop self-medicating!

323
00:21:11,984 --> 00:21:14,983
This proves it's dangerous.
But it's not your fault.

324
00:21:15,224 --> 00:21:18,544
I gave him aspirin.
He hemorrhaged and died.

325
00:21:18,905 --> 00:21:19,864
Easy! Romain!

326
00:21:20,544 --> 00:21:22,823
It was circumstance,
you couldn't know.

327
00:21:23,184 --> 00:21:26,304
Headaches, stiff necks.
I should've thought it through.

328
00:21:26,504 --> 00:21:28,663
Subconsciously,
I wanted him to die!

329
00:21:28,784 --> 00:21:31,663
Besides, I'm relieved he died
and not me!

330
00:21:32,945 --> 00:21:34,063
It's horrible.

331
00:21:34,544 --> 00:21:36,504
It's human.
This was an accident.

332
00:21:36,665 --> 00:21:38,544
He should've known,
he was a nurse.

333
00:21:38,705 --> 00:21:40,104
His aneurism was unavoidable.

334
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,304
My aspirin finished him off.

335
00:21:42,584 --> 00:21:46,104
It sped it up, it didn't kill him.
Maybe he even suffered less.

336
00:21:47,024 --> 00:21:47,784
Think so?

337
00:21:47,945 --> 00:21:50,424
You relieved him,
helped him leave gently.

338
00:21:50,785 --> 00:21:51,464
Painlessly.

339
00:21:54,945 --> 00:21:56,864
I lost my only friend.

340
00:21:57,105 --> 00:21:58,864
He wasn't your only friend.

341
00:22:03,825 --> 00:22:04,824
You have me, too.

342
00:22:05,065 --> 00:22:06,864
Really?
You want to be my friend?

343
00:22:12,385 --> 00:22:15,424
Let's say...
you're my favorite patient.

344
00:22:16,065 --> 00:22:17,064
Thanks, Dimitri!

345
00:22:17,945 --> 00:22:19,184
Thank you!

346
00:22:19,745 --> 00:22:21,224
Can I sleep over tonight?

347
00:22:22,665 --> 00:22:23,624
Just one night.

348
00:22:23,785 --> 00:22:24,504
Please.

349
00:22:32,865 --> 00:22:34,344
Sorry, I'm not very hungry.

350
00:22:34,626 --> 00:22:36,744
It looks delicious, Mrs. Zvenka.

351
00:22:37,746 --> 00:22:39,584
- Can I call you Nora?
- No.

352
00:22:40,345 --> 00:22:42,305
Romain just lost his best friend.

353
00:22:42,465 --> 00:22:43,824
Poor guy.

354
00:22:44,466 --> 00:22:46,424
Now what if you lose your wife?

355
00:22:48,705 --> 00:22:50,665
- That's funny.
- Romain!

356
00:22:51,306 --> 00:22:53,984
You said when in mourning,
you have to laugh.

357
00:22:54,146 --> 00:22:54,944
Not about that!

358
00:22:55,106 --> 00:22:57,185
Inviting a patient
to sleep in my office!

359
00:22:58,866 --> 00:23:00,145
Just like your sister.

360
00:23:00,306 --> 00:23:01,625
I'm not any patient.

361
00:23:01,826 --> 00:23:03,065
One minute.

362
00:23:03,225 --> 00:23:05,744
I'm his favorite patient.
He said so.

363
00:23:07,545 --> 00:23:09,145
You said he was your favorite?

364
00:23:12,585 --> 00:23:13,424
Yes, but...

365
00:23:13,545 --> 00:23:17,025
Maybe I'll sleep on the couch,
and leave you two the bed?

366
00:23:26,786 --> 00:23:27,465
Enough!

367
00:23:28,386 --> 00:23:30,225
But I'm in mourning.

368
00:23:31,906 --> 00:23:33,705
Look out! The dog got in!

369
00:23:34,226 --> 00:23:36,305
- Nina, lock Boogie in your room.
- But he's gentle.

370
00:23:36,466 --> 00:23:38,385
- It's scary, disgusting.
- He's scared.

371
00:23:38,506 --> 00:23:39,745
Our dog isn't dirty.

372
00:23:40,106 --> 00:23:42,385
He doesn't sniff other dogs' asses?

373
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:43,785
That's irrelevant.

374
00:23:44,546 --> 00:23:46,185
All right. Come on, Nina.

375
00:23:46,706 --> 00:23:48,265
- He's not well.
- I'm fine.

376
00:23:48,667 --> 00:23:51,426
I'm in mourning.
And I don't sniff any asses.

377
00:23:51,586 --> 00:23:53,145
Maybe you should!

378
00:23:56,546 --> 00:23:57,865
Romain, please.

379
00:24:36,627 --> 00:24:37,786
Dimitri.

380
00:24:39,627 --> 00:24:40,386
What?

381
00:24:41,507 --> 00:24:42,826
What's going on?

382
00:24:42,987 --> 00:24:44,346
Headache, stiff neck.

383
00:24:44,747 --> 00:24:47,066
- You'll wake my wife.
- He did.

384
00:24:47,627 --> 00:24:48,626
Sorry, darling.

385
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:51,026
Sorry, but I'm having an aneurism.

386
00:24:51,187 --> 00:24:53,786
That would require
actually having a brain!

387
00:24:53,947 --> 00:24:56,426
Nora.
Stop with the aneurism! Back to bed!

388
00:24:56,627 --> 00:24:57,866
Same symptoms.

389
00:24:58,027 --> 00:24:59,986
It burst on this side,
behind my eye.

390
00:25:00,227 --> 00:25:02,466
Warm liquid behind one eye, a leak!

391
00:25:02,627 --> 00:25:03,546
- Stay.
- OK.

392
00:25:03,707 --> 00:25:05,546
- Not you!
- I'll bunk with Nina.

393
00:25:05,707 --> 00:25:06,706
No, honey. Stay.

394
00:25:06,867 --> 00:25:07,786
You get out!

395
00:25:16,347 --> 00:25:18,106
Got it? Your profile is done?

396
00:25:18,387 --> 00:25:20,666
It's OK to put my Visa number in?

397
00:25:20,828 --> 00:25:23,786
The situation is dire.
This is how couples meet now.

398
00:25:24,587 --> 00:25:27,746
Medical dictionary photographer?
No. Just "photographer".

399
00:25:28,628 --> 00:25:29,947
Put 6' 4".

400
00:25:30,107 --> 00:25:31,226
I'm 5' 10".

401
00:25:31,388 --> 00:25:34,786
She won't measure you.
Actually, put 6' 6".

402
00:25:37,148 --> 00:25:38,266
Not 39, put 29.

403
00:25:38,788 --> 00:25:41,307
- I'm 39.
- It's better to put 29.

404
00:25:41,468 --> 00:25:43,066
I don't look 29.

405
00:25:43,187 --> 00:25:45,667
Use an old picture
or from afar.

406
00:25:45,827 --> 00:25:47,986
If you put 39,
put divorced or widowed.

407
00:25:48,107 --> 00:25:50,266
Because 39, no kids,
never married...

408
00:25:50,468 --> 00:25:52,186
Sounds suspicious. Or shady.

409
00:25:52,427 --> 00:25:54,826
Check athletic. Very athletic.

410
00:25:54,988 --> 00:25:56,707
Check triathlon. That's good.

411
00:25:56,867 --> 00:25:58,787
Three sports in one. A go-getter.

412
00:25:58,948 --> 00:26:00,427
But I can't swim.

413
00:26:00,548 --> 00:26:03,267
After a block on a bike
I get cramps.

414
00:26:03,388 --> 00:26:05,507
- Can you run?
- Like anyone else.

415
00:26:05,668 --> 00:26:08,667
See? There is no mono-athlon.
So check triathlon!

416
00:26:09,308 --> 00:26:10,947
Why do you want me
to lie to women?

417
00:26:11,068 --> 00:26:14,227
It's dressing up the ordinary.
You need a lot of dressing up.

418
00:26:14,428 --> 00:26:15,067
Hit "send".

419
00:26:15,828 --> 00:26:16,827
Bedtime!

420
00:26:18,828 --> 00:26:20,187
Thanks for everything.

421
00:26:21,108 --> 00:26:22,107
Don't thank me.

422
00:26:22,268 --> 00:26:25,707
I just want to get rid of you
once and for all.

423
00:26:41,829 --> 00:26:43,268
- Romain?
- No, Eric.

424
00:26:43,428 --> 00:26:46,067
- Pleasure. What's your name?
- Sorry, my mistake.

425
00:26:46,908 --> 00:26:49,227
Daphne, I'm over here.

426
00:26:49,389 --> 00:26:50,627
I'm Romain.

427
00:26:51,588 --> 00:26:52,667
Romain!

428
00:26:52,869 --> 00:26:55,468
Oh, forgive me.
I'm so sorry.

429
00:26:55,668 --> 00:26:57,668
Your Internet description was off,

430
00:26:57,828 --> 00:26:59,308
and your picture's so small...

431
00:26:59,669 --> 00:27:01,547
it's an outdated description.

432
00:27:02,669 --> 00:27:04,067
Have a seat.

433
00:27:08,148 --> 00:27:09,947
So you're a triathlon champion?

434
00:27:12,149 --> 00:27:12,868
Mono-athlon.

435
00:27:13,229 --> 00:27:16,268
No time to work out lately,
I've lost some muscle mass.

436
00:27:17,148 --> 00:27:19,948
We top athletes,
that's the first thing we lose.

437
00:27:20,109 --> 00:27:22,028
Muscle turns to fat.

438
00:27:22,389 --> 00:27:24,828
But I'm getting back to it,
this spring.

439
00:27:26,989 --> 00:27:29,068
Sorry, but you're not 29.

440
00:27:29,349 --> 00:27:30,388
No, I'm 34 or 35.

441
00:27:30,709 --> 00:27:31,708
34 or 35?

442
00:27:31,869 --> 00:27:32,708
39.

443
00:27:33,549 --> 00:27:36,548
9 years ago
I signed up for that dating site.

444
00:27:36,829 --> 00:27:39,108
You're my first date, though.

445
00:27:39,269 --> 00:27:40,308
Time just flies.

446
00:27:40,589 --> 00:27:41,748
I'm leaving.

447
00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:44,028
- Sorry.
- I get it.

448
00:27:51,189 --> 00:27:51,828
What?

449
00:27:52,349 --> 00:27:53,469
Nothing.

450
00:27:57,869 --> 00:27:59,349
Leave athletic.

451
00:27:59,509 --> 00:28:01,708
I can't go through that again.

452
00:28:02,189 --> 00:28:03,508
Add hypochondriac.

453
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:05,349
No, I'm done with that.

454
00:28:05,509 --> 00:28:08,908
That humiliation hit me hard.
I've changed.

455
00:28:09,749 --> 00:28:11,028
That's wonderful.

456
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,508
She's so hot. Isabelle.

457
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:28,788
She liked my true bio,
wants a date.

458
00:28:30,469 --> 00:28:33,269
Don't fuck up this time.
Act like a man, OK?

459
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:35,349
Testosterone galore.

460
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:38,429
A real man. Tough.

461
00:28:41,749 --> 00:28:42,789
Afraid of nothing.

462
00:28:42,949 --> 00:28:44,389
- She'll like you.
- They all do!

463
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:46,229
Give me a mean look.

464
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:48,709
Tell me you want me!
Tell me!

465
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:51,069
- I want you.
- Louder!

466
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:52,989
I want you!

467
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:55,309
Like a man!

468
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:58,109
Like a man, come on! Louder!

469
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,029
You, you, you!

470
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:01,069
I'm impressed!

471
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:03,229
Yeah! Like that!

472
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:05,669
I gained muscle mass
by power walking!

473
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:21,589
Dinner's ready.

474
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:22,829
Coming.

475
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:26,149
We're done with...
his treatment.

476
00:29:26,471 --> 00:29:27,629
Take your time.

477
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:30,949
Try not to let
our 13-year-old see that.

478
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,069
Nora.

479
00:29:45,991 --> 00:29:48,670
Want to talk about
your repressed homosexuality?

480
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:51,109
What repressed homosexuality?

481
00:29:52,351 --> 00:29:54,589
I don't know, you tell me.

482
00:29:55,111 --> 00:29:57,589
Do you remember
a reverse Oedipus complex?

483
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:00,750
Me, in love with my father?
No way!

484
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:03,510
- Why get upset?
- I'm not upset.

485
00:30:03,871 --> 00:30:06,190
I thought you couldn't
analyze your family?

486
00:30:06,311 --> 00:30:10,150
What is this "impatient" patient
doing near our marriage?

487
00:30:10,311 --> 00:30:12,710
He's ill.
I'm his doctor, I'm treating him.

488
00:30:14,031 --> 00:30:15,630
Why him and not the others?

489
00:30:15,911 --> 00:30:18,310
I started with him.
He's my oldest patient.

490
00:30:18,631 --> 00:30:21,710
I once paid my bills
thanks to his hypochondria.

491
00:30:21,871 --> 00:30:24,030
A hypochondriac needs a shrink,
not a doctor.

492
00:30:24,271 --> 00:30:25,950
What could you cure him of?

493
00:30:26,431 --> 00:30:28,990
This century's worst ailment.
Solitude.

494
00:30:29,591 --> 00:30:30,390
Come on.

495
00:30:30,551 --> 00:30:31,870
It's true.

496
00:30:32,631 --> 00:30:34,550
With a woman, he'll be fine.

497
00:30:35,191 --> 00:30:35,990
And us?

498
00:30:36,271 --> 00:30:38,510
You won't hear of him again.

499
00:30:38,991 --> 00:30:40,751
Be patient, my love.

500
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:43,790
Your patient is now your friend,
and I must be "patient"?

501
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:50,390
I always wondered why my mom
said not to marry a shrink.

502
00:30:52,152 --> 00:30:54,551
I'll show you if I'm a homosexual.

503
00:31:01,911 --> 00:31:03,110
- Isabelle.
- Romain!

504
00:31:03,351 --> 00:31:04,351
Sit the hell down.

505
00:31:08,672 --> 00:31:09,551
So you're...

506
00:31:09,872 --> 00:31:11,750
Skip the fucking small talk, OK?

507
00:31:13,992 --> 00:31:14,791
If you say so.

508
00:31:14,991 --> 00:31:15,950
- Thirsty?
- Yeah.

509
00:31:20,151 --> 00:31:22,231
- Can I help you?
- She's thirsty.

510
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:26,871
Same thing as him.

511
00:31:29,072 --> 00:31:30,991
Great! Movie starts in 20 mins.

512
00:31:31,192 --> 00:31:33,751
Hey, you don't mind
a movie on the first date?

513
00:31:33,912 --> 00:31:36,991
No, it's fine.
Stay the hell there. I'm buying.

514
00:31:37,232 --> 00:31:39,511
Two for Les Mis, please.

515
00:31:39,672 --> 00:31:41,271
The six o'clock show.

516
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:44,631
Two for Les Mis. Theater six.

517
00:31:44,792 --> 00:31:47,031
Is there carpeting in theater six?

518
00:31:47,952 --> 00:31:49,071
What the hell?

519
00:31:49,232 --> 00:31:51,271
What are you from Home Depot?

520
00:31:51,472 --> 00:31:53,551
No, it's about the dust mites.

521
00:31:53,712 --> 00:31:57,111
Causes allergies,
and fatal asthma fits.

522
00:31:57,392 --> 00:31:59,511
We have carpeting, floor and walls.

523
00:31:59,833 --> 00:32:01,512
Any movies without carpet?

524
00:32:01,672 --> 00:32:03,351
The only uncarpeted rooms

525
00:32:03,472 --> 00:32:04,632
are the bathrooms.

526
00:32:07,232 --> 00:32:08,472
Too bad, sorry.

527
00:32:11,713 --> 00:32:12,751
- Got it?
- No.

528
00:32:12,913 --> 00:32:14,631
Let's get dinner. I'm starved.

529
00:32:14,792 --> 00:32:17,431
And we could talk,
get to know each other.

530
00:32:17,593 --> 00:32:19,351
OK, great. if you want.

531
00:32:24,232 --> 00:32:26,792
- Wash your hands first?
- No, I'm OK. Thanks.

532
00:32:31,192 --> 00:32:33,312
Sure.
Everyone washes their hands.

533
00:32:34,672 --> 00:32:36,552
Eating with dirty hands is ugly.

534
00:32:38,113 --> 00:32:40,592
You can wash before
or after the operation.

535
00:32:42,033 --> 00:32:44,312
Give the nurse a chance.
She sounds great.

536
00:32:45,273 --> 00:32:46,551
Got to go, I'm eating.

537
00:32:52,072 --> 00:32:52,872
Who was that?

538
00:32:55,113 --> 00:32:56,632
- Who what?
- On the phone.

539
00:32:56,993 --> 00:32:59,312
Oh, who was it. Yeah.

540
00:32:59,513 --> 00:33:00,552
A surgeon friend.

541
00:33:00,713 --> 00:33:03,432
Dr. Jacquard. Remember?
The seminar in Djerba.

542
00:33:03,593 --> 00:33:04,832
He just...

543
00:33:07,553 --> 00:33:09,472
OK, it was him. Sorry.

544
00:33:09,793 --> 00:33:11,512
He's on a date, it's working.

545
00:33:34,394 --> 00:33:35,072
Chicken?

546
00:33:35,633 --> 00:33:36,472
No, thank you.

547
00:33:47,073 --> 00:33:48,952
I live right down there.

548
00:33:54,394 --> 00:33:56,392
Well, I have to go. Good night.

549
00:33:56,674 --> 00:33:58,273
Thanks for a nice evening.

550
00:33:58,433 --> 00:33:59,673
No nightcap?

551
00:33:59,834 --> 00:34:01,552
No, I get up early.

552
00:34:05,273 --> 00:34:06,033
Why laugh?

553
00:34:06,194 --> 00:34:08,632
First time I ever struck out. Wow.

554
00:34:08,794 --> 00:34:10,153
I love it.

555
00:34:10,354 --> 00:34:13,433
Not only do I wind up asking,
but then you say no!

556
00:34:13,834 --> 00:34:14,873
Don't think I...

557
00:34:24,314 --> 00:34:25,313
No, wait!

558
00:34:25,434 --> 00:34:27,753
How about an erotic game
to spice it up?

559
00:34:27,954 --> 00:34:29,553
What? You want to tie me up?

560
00:34:50,994 --> 00:34:52,953
What the hell? What are you doing?

561
00:34:53,154 --> 00:34:54,233
That's my fantasy.

562
00:34:55,155 --> 00:34:57,473
Washing my armpits?
A fantasy?

563
00:35:08,554 --> 00:35:10,354
Don't worry, there are others.

564
00:35:11,475 --> 00:35:14,474
I'll stop bothering you,
and your family.

565
00:35:15,035 --> 00:35:18,113
- You won't see me again.
- Really? Why?

566
00:35:18,234 --> 00:35:20,153
I can't do it, Dimitri.

567
00:35:20,435 --> 00:35:23,033
It's all over,
I'll be 40 in 5 months.

568
00:35:23,435 --> 00:35:24,394
I'm alone.

569
00:35:24,594 --> 00:35:27,833
I'm a sick hypochondriac.
It can only get worse with age.

570
00:35:31,395 --> 00:35:34,954
You're lucky to have her.
And you have a beautiful daughter.

571
00:35:35,274 --> 00:35:36,634
Hear that, my love?

572
00:35:37,315 --> 00:35:38,914
But we have a son, too.

573
00:35:39,155 --> 00:35:40,994
Really? I never saw your son.

574
00:35:41,595 --> 00:35:42,834
Sure you have.

575
00:35:43,235 --> 00:35:45,274
He's always here when you are.

576
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:51,914
Look, Romain,

577
00:35:52,155 --> 00:35:53,634
true love

578
00:35:53,755 --> 00:35:56,594
is loving someone for who he is,
not what he's done

579
00:35:56,715 --> 00:35:58,314
or hasn't done.

580
00:35:58,675 --> 00:36:02,554
Somewhere there's a woman
who'll love you for yourself.

581
00:36:02,715 --> 00:36:04,515
For your sensitivity,

582
00:36:04,675 --> 00:36:06,195
your traits and flaws.

583
00:36:06,316 --> 00:36:06,954
Too late.

584
00:36:09,076 --> 00:36:11,314
I'll wind up with no wife, no kids,

585
00:36:11,515 --> 00:36:14,754
old, ugly, stupid, lonely and sick.

586
00:36:14,956 --> 00:36:16,354
Sick, no.

587
00:36:16,516 --> 00:36:17,914
The rest, yeah.

588
00:36:19,675 --> 00:36:22,794
OK, desperate times
call for desperate measures.

589
00:36:33,715 --> 00:36:34,755
Why are we here?

590
00:36:34,915 --> 00:36:36,954
For your first humanitarian mission.

591
00:36:37,596 --> 00:36:39,035
Give me your ID.

592
00:36:39,556 --> 00:36:41,274
See those illegal immigrants?

593
00:36:41,436 --> 00:36:43,995
They're from Cherkistan.
Know where that is?

594
00:36:44,196 --> 00:36:45,594
Your family's from there.

595
00:36:45,715 --> 00:36:49,595
A small, war-torn eastern nation,
with no national health plan.

596
00:36:49,795 --> 00:36:51,114
That's about right.

597
00:36:51,276 --> 00:36:53,154
The lucky ones
get refugee status.

598
00:36:53,275 --> 00:36:56,355
The others get a temporary visa,
then they're deported.

599
00:36:56,956 --> 00:36:58,035
Such a cruel world.

600
00:37:00,036 --> 00:37:02,195
- Hello, Doctor.
- How are you?

601
00:37:21,116 --> 00:37:22,675
- Come with me.
- What?!

602
00:37:22,836 --> 00:37:25,516
You help them from the boat
to the medical tents.

603
00:37:25,676 --> 00:37:28,075
- I can't.
- Be brave. We need everyone.

604
00:37:30,116 --> 00:37:33,115
- I can't get on that boat.
- Make an effort for once!

605
00:37:33,596 --> 00:37:37,235
I'd love to help them,
but I'd catch some horrible virus.

606
00:37:37,397 --> 00:37:38,435
Go wait in the car!

607
00:37:38,796 --> 00:37:41,035
You're a lowlife! You're pitiful!

608
00:37:44,036 --> 00:37:45,155
Hi, Anna.

609
00:37:45,317 --> 00:37:47,395
About time! We're overloaded!

610
00:37:47,597 --> 00:37:48,875
Enough. I'm here.

611
00:37:48,996 --> 00:37:51,395
Only 3 doctors for all these people.

612
00:38:18,517 --> 00:38:20,316
- Dank ya.
- It's nothing!

613
00:38:20,837 --> 00:38:22,116
No, please!

614
00:38:22,277 --> 00:38:23,556
No, thank you. Please...

615
00:38:23,717 --> 00:38:25,356
- Dank ya.
- You're welcome.

616
00:38:29,357 --> 00:38:30,476
Who's he?

617
00:38:31,397 --> 00:38:32,676
A friend who's healing.

618
00:39:22,638 --> 00:39:23,437
Dank ya.

619
00:39:23,877 --> 00:39:25,157
- Dank ya.
- That's OK.

620
00:39:35,438 --> 00:39:36,157
Over here!

621
00:39:41,877 --> 00:39:42,517
Sir!

622
00:39:42,957 --> 00:39:44,557
Sir, can you hear me?

623
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:08,957
All right now, calm down!

624
00:40:09,118 --> 00:40:10,357
Don't touch me!

625
00:40:11,038 --> 00:40:12,597
Let me do my job.

626
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:50,397
I must have a horrible accent.

627
00:41:00,238 --> 00:41:02,318
Anton Miroslav,

628
00:41:02,839 --> 00:41:05,398
leader
of the Cherkistani revolution.

629
00:41:05,559 --> 00:41:09,158
I follow news of your nation,
which is sort of mine as well.

630
00:41:09,319 --> 00:41:11,078
My family is from Drassjna,
like you.

631
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:12,478
My name is Anna.

632
00:41:12,959 --> 00:41:15,398
Anna Lempereur,
maiden name Zvenka.

633
00:41:16,399 --> 00:41:17,558
Zvenka!

634
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:19,358
Rest.

635
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:21,318
You need it after that ordeal.

636
00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:24,318
You were thought dead
after that attack.

637
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:27,198
I'm so moved to see you, alive!

638
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:29,758
Sorry, I must seem so...

639
00:41:31,399 --> 00:41:32,638
Do you even understand me?

640
00:41:37,479 --> 00:41:38,998
Dank ya.

641
00:41:41,559 --> 00:41:44,239
Anton Miroslav thanking me!
The world is backwards.

642
00:41:46,439 --> 00:41:48,278
Enough talk. Time is short.

643
00:41:48,479 --> 00:41:50,599
I'll take your things
through security,

644
00:41:50,759 --> 00:41:53,038
put them in my car,
and I'll be back for you.

645
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:54,079
Don't move.

646
00:41:56,919 --> 00:41:59,919
I understand a little.
French a little.

647
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,158
Great. Where did you learn?

648
00:42:03,719 --> 00:42:06,838
Verlaine, Rimbaud, Balzac.

649
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,478
Much need poetry in civil war.

650
00:42:16,799 --> 00:42:18,439
It's for a fake passport.

651
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,719
Romain!

652
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,679
I can't believe it!
Romain!

653
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,559
No way!

654
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,559
I'll get up.

655
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,559
You're beyond hope! Shit!

656
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,999
On a glucose drip?
Shame on you!

657
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:53,119
A moment of weakness,
I feel better.

658
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,040
I'll help the real patients now.

659
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,359
Hurry up! Take that IV out.

660
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,839
Shouldn't I finish?

661
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,319
You're crazy!

662
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,639
- Dimitri, please!
- Coming.

663
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,279
Go help
instead of clogging up a bed!

664
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,839
I'll make the bed,
and I'll be right there. Coming.

665
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:14,399
Miroslav! Anton Miroslav!

666
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,119
You want to get spotted!?

667
00:43:27,881 --> 00:43:29,600
Of course. You're delirious.

668
00:43:31,761 --> 00:43:33,359
I need to take care of you.

669
00:43:34,401 --> 00:43:37,720
Here. Your fake passport.
Just like a real one.

670
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:38,600
Remember...

671
00:43:50,681 --> 00:43:52,880
Try to look as French as possible.

672
00:43:53,041 --> 00:43:53,760
And relax!

673
00:44:02,241 --> 00:44:03,160
Jean Valjean?

674
00:44:06,281 --> 00:44:08,880
Victor Hugo stole our name.

675
00:44:09,041 --> 00:44:11,200
Who knew Les Mis
would be such a hit?

676
00:44:15,281 --> 00:44:15,920
Go ahead.

677
00:44:31,321 --> 00:44:32,440
Dank ya.

678
00:44:34,121 --> 00:44:35,320
You're welcome.

679
00:44:49,441 --> 00:44:50,201
Oh my Lord!

680
00:45:14,522 --> 00:45:16,001
Anna? Is that you?

681
00:45:16,442 --> 00:45:18,481
Guillaume! You're not in Brussels?

682
00:45:18,642 --> 00:45:21,161
Meeting got pushed back.
I got a later train.

683
00:45:21,522 --> 00:45:22,201
Who's he?

684
00:45:22,402 --> 00:45:24,481
I didn't have time to warn you.

685
00:45:24,642 --> 00:45:28,081
This is Anton Miroslav,
who'll be staying with us a while.

686
00:45:31,402 --> 00:45:32,641
Can we talk for a sec?

687
00:45:34,482 --> 00:45:36,881
Stop bringing illegals
to this house!

688
00:45:37,082 --> 00:45:40,441
He's not just any illegal.
He's Anton Miroslav.

689
00:45:40,602 --> 00:45:42,082
Hero of the revolution!

690
00:45:42,242 --> 00:45:43,201
So what?

691
00:45:43,362 --> 00:45:45,682
Are you done?
He has a fever, he's hungry.

692
00:45:45,842 --> 00:45:48,241
Anna, why not collect
stray cats or dogs,

693
00:45:48,402 --> 00:45:50,761
like your housewife friends
around here?

694
00:45:50,882 --> 00:45:52,162
That's so stupid.

695
00:45:52,362 --> 00:45:54,481
Besides, I don't like his face.

696
00:45:54,642 --> 00:45:56,681
You don't know him.
Maybe he's dangerous.

697
00:45:56,882 --> 00:45:59,201
- Have the vet put him down!
- Stop, I'm serious.

698
00:45:59,363 --> 00:46:01,201
So am I. He's not a stray,

699
00:46:01,362 --> 00:46:03,961
he's a hero,
who's saving my nation from tyranny.

700
00:46:04,403 --> 00:46:06,961
Saving your nation from tyranny!
Let me laugh.

701
00:46:07,122 --> 00:46:08,521
I don't see what's funny.

702
00:46:08,723 --> 00:46:09,961
You're Anna Lempereur.

703
00:46:10,163 --> 00:46:12,481
You wouldn't last a day
in Cherkistan.

704
00:46:17,042 --> 00:46:19,522
You always put me down,
slight me in public.

705
00:46:19,682 --> 00:46:22,122
He can't understand!
I'm just saying the truth!

706
00:46:22,283 --> 00:46:25,002
The truth is I found some meaning
and you hate it.

707
00:46:27,443 --> 00:46:29,641
Stupid enough to quit my job.

708
00:46:30,122 --> 00:46:33,442
Don't start that again.
He can't stay more than a week.

709
00:46:33,683 --> 00:46:34,682
I want him gone.

710
00:46:34,843 --> 00:46:36,922
He stays as long as he wants!

711
00:46:37,043 --> 00:46:38,762
In 8 days, I call immigration.

712
00:46:38,923 --> 00:46:42,282
I'll tell your clients you get
kickbacks from subcontractors.

713
00:46:43,763 --> 00:46:45,282
You're a real bitch.

714
00:46:45,443 --> 00:46:46,802
That makes two of us.

715
00:46:51,843 --> 00:46:53,282
Welcome to France, Anton.

716
00:47:04,483 --> 00:47:05,682
Faubert.

717
00:47:41,163 --> 00:47:42,323
Romain, are you home?

718
00:47:46,364 --> 00:47:48,362
Where did that moron go?

719
00:48:06,644 --> 00:48:08,803
As early as the Balkan war,

720
00:48:08,964 --> 00:48:11,203
he emerged victorious
from bloody battles.

721
00:48:11,364 --> 00:48:12,763
Oh, I see.

722
00:48:12,924 --> 00:48:15,243
Since the aborted coup in 2011,
Miroslav

723
00:48:15,444 --> 00:48:17,403
escaped
several assassination attempts.

724
00:48:17,564 --> 00:48:19,563
Oh shit, I see.

725
00:48:20,764 --> 00:48:24,363
Hero for some, terrorist for others,
he is hidden in the mountains

726
00:48:24,484 --> 00:48:28,044
ruling the Cherkistani revolt
with an iron fist.

727
00:48:28,204 --> 00:48:29,964
Oh, I see.

728
00:48:33,205 --> 00:48:35,364
Anton Miroslav.

729
00:48:35,924 --> 00:48:37,203
That's me.

730
00:48:39,644 --> 00:48:40,323
Shit.

731
00:48:48,044 --> 00:48:50,043
Oh shit, I see!

732
00:48:56,044 --> 00:48:57,084
Voice mail.

733
00:48:57,205 --> 00:49:00,603
Usually he answers for me.
I'm sure something happened.

734
00:49:00,765 --> 00:49:02,604
I don't want to alarm you.

735
00:49:02,764 --> 00:49:06,684
Maybe some Cherkistani jumped him
for his cell phone,

736
00:49:06,805 --> 00:49:08,643
a Visa card, a little cash.

737
00:49:09,004 --> 00:49:11,564
It's my fault. Put out an APB.

738
00:49:11,725 --> 00:49:14,084
In 48 hours,
he'll be considered missing.

739
00:49:14,245 --> 00:49:16,204
That's the law.
I need a recent photo.

740
00:49:16,525 --> 00:49:18,124
I have x-rays, no photos.

741
00:49:19,045 --> 00:49:20,724
- That him?
- No, my sister.

742
00:49:20,885 --> 00:49:23,004
She was with me.
Maybe she saw him.

743
00:49:24,285 --> 00:49:25,564
Dim, come over.

744
00:49:25,725 --> 00:49:27,124
I need you to see someone.

745
00:49:27,285 --> 00:49:28,844
I'm at the police station.

746
00:49:29,005 --> 00:49:30,764
At Calais, my friend went missing.

747
00:49:30,925 --> 00:49:32,564
Sorry I can't help you.
What do I do?

748
00:49:32,965 --> 00:49:34,124
Call another doctor.

749
00:49:34,285 --> 00:49:35,684
I need you. I'll explain.

750
00:49:36,365 --> 00:49:37,604
I'll stop by tomorrow.

751
00:49:38,085 --> 00:49:40,244
You're a peach, I love you. Kiss!

752
00:50:16,846 --> 00:50:18,085
You look better.

753
00:50:22,565 --> 00:50:25,045
I made some dinner.
Sit down.

754
00:50:26,446 --> 00:50:28,285
Not small salad maybe?

755
00:50:28,406 --> 00:50:29,524
I'm on a diet.

756
00:50:29,686 --> 00:50:32,365
A diet? After 3 months
starving on a ship?

757
00:50:34,166 --> 00:50:36,085
All right, but chew slowly.

758
00:50:36,646 --> 00:50:38,765
Too long no meat.
Iron poor.

759
00:50:40,846 --> 00:50:41,765
French beef?

760
00:50:42,886 --> 00:50:45,205
Yes, of course.
Thirst too.

761
00:50:45,686 --> 00:50:47,565
- What will you drink?
- Soy milk.

762
00:50:50,166 --> 00:50:50,965
Beer!

763
00:51:18,046 --> 00:51:19,286
Good meat.

764
00:51:20,166 --> 00:51:21,125
I'll get a napkin.

765
00:51:25,846 --> 00:51:26,606
Are you OK?

766
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:30,005
Oh my God!
You're still very weak.

767
00:51:30,166 --> 00:51:31,526
Better lie down.

768
00:51:38,127 --> 00:51:39,566
Anton, can I come in?

769
00:51:48,407 --> 00:51:49,565
No more fever.

770
00:51:50,886 --> 00:51:52,526
I made you some herb tea.

771
00:51:55,727 --> 00:51:57,725
I shall not speak or think

772
00:51:59,127 --> 00:52:02,206
but infinite love
will swell in my soul

773
00:52:02,367 --> 00:52:05,286
and I shall travel far, very far,
like a Bohemian

774
00:52:05,447 --> 00:52:09,606
by nature,
happy as with a woman.

775
00:52:12,167 --> 00:52:13,846
Arthur Rimbaud.

776
00:52:15,127 --> 00:52:16,366
How beautiful, Anton.

777
00:52:17,287 --> 00:52:18,246
You know?

778
00:52:18,887 --> 00:52:21,806
Of course.
It's a love poem to Verlaine.

779
00:52:23,327 --> 00:52:25,446
You study Rimbaud in Cherkistan?

780
00:52:25,567 --> 00:52:28,846
That's how I loved
the French language.

781
00:52:29,007 --> 00:52:31,086
With romantic author.

782
00:52:51,527 --> 00:52:53,526
Sometimes life isn't fair.

783
00:53:07,728 --> 00:53:09,966
Lovely to see you again.

784
00:53:11,167 --> 00:53:11,927
Piotr,

785
00:53:12,888 --> 00:53:14,046
Anton Miroslav.

786
00:53:33,568 --> 00:53:35,647
Maybe speak French. More discreet.

787
00:53:39,328 --> 00:53:41,247
What pride for me!

788
00:53:41,368 --> 00:53:43,687
Too bad can't make photo.

789
00:53:44,808 --> 00:53:46,207
You must eat.

790
00:53:46,368 --> 00:53:48,927
You too, Anna.
You are my guests.

791
00:53:49,048 --> 00:53:52,648
No, thank you.
Much meat yesterday.

792
00:54:08,969 --> 00:54:09,727
Enjoy.

793
00:54:39,529 --> 00:54:40,927
Are you all right?

794
00:54:42,848 --> 00:54:45,328
It tastes like home.

795
00:54:45,488 --> 00:54:46,608
It's so, so good.

796
00:55:03,369 --> 00:55:04,328
It's a cliché.

797
00:55:04,489 --> 00:55:06,728
But your first time in Paris,
you must.

798
00:55:40,410 --> 00:55:42,049
Are you sure, Anton?

799
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:43,808
I have to go alone.

800
00:55:43,970 --> 00:55:45,649
It's too dangerous for you.

801
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:48,368
It's better, Anna,
not know too much.

802
00:55:48,570 --> 00:55:49,928
Be very careful.

803
00:55:50,090 --> 00:55:51,488
Come right back.

804
00:55:51,650 --> 00:55:53,689
Rumor has it that you're dead.

805
00:55:53,810 --> 00:55:56,209
Rumor is harder to defeat
than dictatorship.

806
00:55:56,370 --> 00:55:57,929
We need you here.

807
00:55:58,130 --> 00:56:01,208
I'm in no shape to travel.

808
00:56:01,809 --> 00:56:04,448
And I need forged papers.

809
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:07,049
Contact Grigory.

810
00:56:50,050 --> 00:56:50,889
Wounded?

811
00:56:55,690 --> 00:56:57,289
For fever.
Acetaminophen.

812
00:56:57,451 --> 00:56:59,289
Four times daily, at most.

813
00:56:59,530 --> 00:57:01,530
For infection, antibiotics.

814
00:57:04,651 --> 00:57:07,050
You have to eat at the same time.
During meals.

815
00:57:07,251 --> 00:57:08,370
Intestinal flora...

816
00:57:09,970 --> 00:57:10,730
No, nothing.

817
00:57:13,570 --> 00:57:15,129
Until it heals up.

818
00:57:15,891 --> 00:57:17,289
This is your apartment.

819
00:57:45,091 --> 00:57:46,090
Drassjna.

820
00:57:48,651 --> 00:57:50,650
Must have changed a lot since then.

821
00:57:54,691 --> 00:57:57,930
I wish you could have
met my grandfather.

822
00:57:58,531 --> 00:58:02,090
Igor Zvenka.
He would've been proud to know you.

823
00:58:03,092 --> 00:58:04,250
Anna Zvenka,

824
00:58:04,371 --> 00:58:07,570
need to have
honest talk with you.

825
00:58:08,411 --> 00:58:10,810
No! Don't say a word.

826
00:58:10,971 --> 00:58:13,450
I feel the same way
about you, but...

827
00:58:13,611 --> 00:58:17,090
we mustn't. it's too trivial.
It would ruin everything.

828
00:58:18,932 --> 00:58:21,370
I bought this long ago,
at a flea market.

829
00:58:21,531 --> 00:58:23,570
I started alone, but...

830
00:58:27,131 --> 00:58:29,050
Let's speak only Cherkistani, OK?

831
00:58:31,172 --> 00:58:34,411
I've always wanted to learn.
This is my chance.

832
00:58:48,572 --> 00:58:49,570
I said it wrong?

833
00:58:52,292 --> 00:58:53,611
My accent isn't great?

834
00:58:58,212 --> 00:58:59,571
Guarazd = OK

835
00:58:59,732 --> 00:59:01,171
I need practice.

836
00:59:06,252 --> 00:59:07,731
Small spelling mistake.

837
00:59:17,052 --> 00:59:20,131
Maybe better, me first learn French.

838
00:59:20,252 --> 00:59:21,452
Then you Cherkistani.

839
00:59:23,412 --> 00:59:25,331
But you have a talent for French.

840
00:59:26,332 --> 00:59:28,652
You understand most of what I say.

841
00:59:29,532 --> 00:59:30,731
More than yesterday.

842
00:59:31,732 --> 00:59:32,571
So-so.

843
00:59:32,692 --> 00:59:34,131
Teach me a little.

844
00:59:34,572 --> 00:59:35,531
For example,

845
00:59:35,652 --> 00:59:37,571
how do you say, "I love you"?

846
00:59:40,252 --> 00:59:42,291
Guarazd means "OK".

847
00:59:42,612 --> 00:59:44,211
I know that, but...

848
00:59:44,373 --> 00:59:45,932
"I love you"...

849
00:59:52,692 --> 00:59:54,572
Tsyboulya - porey = leeks

850
00:59:56,532 --> 00:59:57,572
Tsyboulya - porey.

851
00:59:59,412 --> 01:00:00,452
That's "leeks".

852
01:00:03,893 --> 01:00:05,452
Sparja is asparagus.

853
01:00:08,133 --> 01:00:09,131
Harbouz.

854
01:00:13,212 --> 01:00:14,692
- That's pumpkin.
- Pumpkin.

855
01:00:16,092 --> 01:00:18,412
Actually...
There's a misunderstanding.

856
01:00:19,413 --> 01:00:20,652
In English...

857
01:00:23,733 --> 01:00:25,172
Italian, Ti amo.

858
01:00:26,133 --> 01:00:29,172
Te quiero in Spanish.
And in Cherkistani...?

859
01:00:31,493 --> 01:00:33,732
Many different ways to say.

860
01:00:33,893 --> 01:00:36,132
Fine, but the most common way.

861
01:00:50,653 --> 01:00:51,532
Lovya.

862
01:00:54,533 --> 01:00:56,052
Lovya, mintya.

863
01:01:02,053 --> 01:01:02,772
Relax!

864
01:01:02,893 --> 01:01:04,053
Just my friends

865
01:01:04,213 --> 01:01:06,333
for a "shop my closet" party.

866
01:01:06,694 --> 01:01:08,892
I forgot to cancel.
I'll send them away.

867
01:01:12,973 --> 01:01:16,373
Anna Lempereur-Zvenka here.
Leave a message at the tone.

868
01:01:18,613 --> 01:01:19,293
Excuse me.

869
01:01:19,974 --> 01:01:21,612
- Where was I?
- The plans.

870
01:01:24,414 --> 01:01:26,813
Now, here...

871
01:01:29,134 --> 01:01:30,612
Well, you take it...

872
01:01:37,854 --> 01:01:38,973
Sorry, Anton.

873
01:01:39,614 --> 01:01:42,533
And then, I break loose!

874
01:01:44,654 --> 01:01:46,973
And I approach behind guard.

875
01:01:47,734 --> 01:01:48,933
And him I strangle!

876
01:01:51,134 --> 01:01:52,213
Up against bars.

877
01:01:56,174 --> 01:01:58,733
I steal key
and I jump out of window.

878
01:02:00,174 --> 01:02:01,453
Three stories!

879
01:02:05,174 --> 01:02:06,214
Sprain ankle.

880
01:02:07,414 --> 01:02:08,693
No problem.

881
01:02:10,494 --> 01:02:11,533
No problem!

882
01:02:13,775 --> 01:02:15,934
I turn. Eight soldiers.

883
01:02:16,734 --> 01:02:18,253
Attacking me.

884
01:02:18,575 --> 01:02:19,373
Kalashnikovs!

885
01:02:22,254 --> 01:02:24,413
I run, run.
Zigzag through bullets.

886
01:02:25,934 --> 01:02:27,493
Ow, ankle! Zigzag!

887
01:02:28,254 --> 01:02:29,453
I jump in river.

888
01:02:32,654 --> 01:02:34,093
Iceshski.

889
01:02:35,575 --> 01:02:36,774
Not move.

890
01:02:36,935 --> 01:02:39,493
Not breathe in water.
Make bubbles.

891
01:02:39,935 --> 01:02:42,733
Right, or they shoot at the bubbles.

892
01:02:42,895 --> 01:02:43,854
Of course.

893
01:02:44,414 --> 01:02:46,494
Swimming underwater.

894
01:02:46,615 --> 01:02:48,414
Dark and swim.

895
01:02:49,694 --> 01:02:51,294
Two bubbles, no more.

896
01:02:52,094 --> 01:02:53,014
I touch boatsky.

897
01:02:53,534 --> 01:02:54,253
Ship!

898
01:02:55,055 --> 01:02:56,653
I climb up.

899
01:02:57,854 --> 01:02:58,894
Big screws.

900
01:03:02,295 --> 01:03:05,054
There, a Russian vessel.
Relief.

901
01:03:05,295 --> 01:03:07,614
I go in France,
hiding bottom of ship.

902
01:03:08,455 --> 01:03:09,614
And here I am.

903
01:03:12,495 --> 01:03:13,334
What a story!

904
01:03:13,455 --> 01:03:14,534
What a life!

905
01:03:14,695 --> 01:03:17,814
More exciting
than a "shop my closet" party!

906
01:03:18,215 --> 01:03:20,174
Thank you to Anna Zvenka,

907
01:03:20,295 --> 01:03:22,734
who saved me from French police.

908
01:03:22,895 --> 01:03:24,094
Great courage.

909
01:03:24,575 --> 01:03:25,774
Bravo, Anna.

910
01:03:26,455 --> 01:03:27,534
Don't applaud me.

911
01:03:27,735 --> 01:03:29,814
It was my duty as a humanist.

912
01:03:30,055 --> 01:03:31,814
Great men like Anton

913
01:03:31,975 --> 01:03:34,254
are writing history
with a capital H.

914
01:03:34,776 --> 01:03:36,455
Working for a just world.

915
01:03:36,735 --> 01:03:39,455
I propose a toast,
to the hero of the Balkans!

916
01:03:41,695 --> 01:03:42,894
Kvanya!

917
01:03:46,935 --> 01:03:48,294
It's all right, all right.

918
01:03:49,615 --> 01:03:52,055
It's just Constance.
She's always late.

919
01:03:55,975 --> 01:03:57,815
Raspberry! Come here!

920
01:04:15,416 --> 01:04:18,734
Constance, this is embarrassing.
Could you get your dog?

921
01:04:20,655 --> 01:04:21,615
Raspberry, heel!

922
01:04:25,176 --> 01:04:29,535
Maybe they tortured him
using rabid Chihuahuas?

923
01:04:29,816 --> 01:04:30,935
Yeah, maybe.

924
01:04:31,096 --> 01:04:33,775
That's the first time
Raspberry scared someone.

925
01:04:34,816 --> 01:04:36,815
He does seem very sensitive.

926
01:04:36,976 --> 01:04:39,015
Good night, girls.
Mum's the word!

927
01:04:39,416 --> 01:04:40,615
Don't worry!

928
01:04:54,577 --> 01:04:56,496
People have phobias, Anton.

929
01:04:57,296 --> 01:04:59,055
Even the bravest people.

930
01:05:00,056 --> 01:05:01,776
Nothing to be ashamed of.

931
01:05:02,696 --> 01:05:05,775
You're phobic about little dogs.
That's all.

932
01:05:06,296 --> 01:05:09,655
Sure, in your case it's very...
unexpected.

933
01:05:12,016 --> 01:05:13,656
You were very scared of Raspberry.

934
01:05:15,136 --> 01:05:16,056
Raspberry...

935
01:05:54,057 --> 01:05:54,936
Wait, stop!

936
01:06:48,698 --> 01:06:50,296
I had a wonderful night.

937
01:06:50,537 --> 01:06:51,856
My best ever.

938
01:06:52,298 --> 01:06:54,016
I don't feel guilty at all.

939
01:06:55,457 --> 01:06:56,416
I'm even happy.

940
01:06:57,178 --> 01:06:58,096
Thanks to you.

941
01:07:01,058 --> 01:07:03,457
I know.
You're devoted to your cause.

942
01:07:04,018 --> 01:07:06,337
No woman should stand in your way.

943
01:07:07,138 --> 01:07:08,537
Hush.

944
01:07:08,698 --> 01:07:11,337
You must go back to the civil war.

945
01:07:11,498 --> 01:07:13,577
It fills me with sorrow, but...

946
01:07:13,738 --> 01:07:16,857
I'm already so lucky
to have these moments, just for us.

947
01:07:18,138 --> 01:07:19,257
And forever.

948
01:07:22,738 --> 01:07:25,257
Whatever happens after,

949
01:07:25,978 --> 01:07:28,737
your love has changed me.
Forever.

950
01:07:32,218 --> 01:07:33,377
It's Dimitri.

951
01:07:34,458 --> 01:07:37,817
He's my brother, a doctor.
I asked him to look at you.

952
01:07:44,898 --> 01:07:47,177
He's not my husband,
he's my brother.

953
01:07:48,538 --> 01:07:49,898
He came here for you.

954
01:07:57,819 --> 01:07:58,658
Bring your dog?

955
01:07:58,818 --> 01:08:01,457
Let me speak to the naked guy
in your guest room.

956
01:08:01,618 --> 01:08:03,257
That's Anton Miroslav,

957
01:08:03,378 --> 01:08:05,537
Cherkistani rebel leader,
in my home.

958
01:08:08,339 --> 01:08:09,497
Come out.

959
01:08:10,059 --> 01:08:10,778
Out!

960
01:08:16,779 --> 01:08:19,018
It's fine, Anton.
There is no risk.

961
01:08:19,458 --> 01:08:20,417
He's my brother.

962
01:08:22,659 --> 01:08:23,618
A kind doctor.

963
01:08:24,099 --> 01:08:25,658
Not need doctor.

964
01:08:25,979 --> 01:08:27,058
Not need.

965
01:08:29,418 --> 01:08:32,298
I feel something
powerful between you two.

966
01:08:32,539 --> 01:08:36,378
See, Dimitri?
Can't deny your roots forever.

967
01:08:37,059 --> 01:08:39,818
So you're the famous
Cherkistani rebel leader?

968
01:08:42,619 --> 01:08:45,698
Anton's teaching me Cherkistani,
I'm teaching him French.

969
01:08:45,859 --> 01:08:47,898
And he is... very gifted.

970
01:08:48,819 --> 01:08:49,538
Dank ya.

971
01:08:51,339 --> 01:08:52,298
Oh yeah.

972
01:08:52,579 --> 01:08:53,858
He speaks very well.

973
01:08:54,019 --> 01:08:55,258
Why hide under the bed?

974
01:08:56,579 --> 01:08:58,978
I thought there was police.

975
01:08:59,099 --> 01:09:00,658
No, was not police.

976
01:09:00,820 --> 01:09:01,899
Was doctor.

977
01:09:03,059 --> 01:09:04,818
- Want to examine him?
- Oh yes!

978
01:09:05,219 --> 01:09:08,058
A thorough examination.
He could really use one.

979
01:09:08,579 --> 01:09:11,499
I'll take him to the hospital.
He needs a brain scan.

980
01:09:11,659 --> 01:09:12,298
Think so?

981
01:09:12,460 --> 01:09:14,499
Yes. He's much sicker
than he looks.

982
01:09:15,179 --> 01:09:18,099
Don't worry. My brother
will take good care of you.

983
01:09:18,259 --> 01:09:19,179
I sure will.

984
01:09:26,260 --> 01:09:28,218
Cognac, please. Nothing for him.

985
01:09:28,819 --> 01:09:31,859
I was worried!
I reported you missing to the cops!

986
01:09:32,220 --> 01:09:34,299
I feared the worst, where were you?

987
01:09:34,459 --> 01:09:36,258
At my sister's, playing rebel!

988
01:09:36,900 --> 01:09:39,059
She's the woman of my dreams.

989
01:09:40,620 --> 01:09:43,938
No, she's my brother-in-law's woman.
And she'll stay that way!

990
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:45,498
No, she's crazy about me.

991
01:09:45,820 --> 01:09:48,138
Not you, moron!
She's crazy about Miroslav!

992
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:50,699
Maybe, but with my looks
and my sensitivity.

993
01:09:50,860 --> 01:09:52,139
I borrowed his story,

994
01:09:52,340 --> 01:09:54,819
but love is about who you are,
not what you do.

995
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:56,659
- You told me that.
- Never.

996
01:09:56,780 --> 01:09:58,779
You told me
to dress up the ordinary.

997
01:09:58,940 --> 01:10:00,259
Not with my goddamn sister!

998
01:10:02,580 --> 01:10:04,419
She mistook me for him.

999
01:10:05,380 --> 01:10:07,379
If you had seen her eyes.

1000
01:10:07,540 --> 01:10:09,699
No woman ever
looked at me like that.

1001
01:10:09,940 --> 01:10:12,899
The most beautiful night of love
I've ever known.

1002
01:10:14,420 --> 01:10:16,819
No...
You didn't sleep with my sister.

1003
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:18,940
And without a condom.

1004
01:10:19,420 --> 01:10:21,739
Imagine me, without a condom!
I'm cured.

1005
01:10:29,220 --> 01:10:31,859
Romain, after all I did for you.

1006
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:33,379
I'm sorry.

1007
01:10:33,821 --> 01:10:35,539
I'll go confess and apologize.

1008
01:10:35,700 --> 01:10:37,900
No way. She can't know
you're my patient.

1009
01:10:38,981 --> 01:10:41,020
Go say farewell
with your stupid accent

1010
01:10:41,180 --> 01:10:42,659
and call it quits.

1011
01:10:42,980 --> 01:10:45,139
She did so much.
I owe her the truth.

1012
01:10:45,341 --> 01:10:47,220
I can't lie to her anymore.

1013
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:53,340
I'm going to hit you.

1014
01:10:53,780 --> 01:10:56,340
No, you're my doctor.
The Hippocratic oath!

1015
01:10:57,140 --> 01:10:57,820
Right.

1016
01:10:58,621 --> 01:11:00,780
Some ice in a dish towel, please.

1017
01:11:03,301 --> 01:11:05,419
Don't worry, it's all right!
I'm a doctor.

1018
01:11:07,820 --> 01:11:09,499
He's my patient. I got it.

1019
01:11:09,941 --> 01:11:10,620
How much?

1020
01:11:22,661 --> 01:11:23,900
That's him! Go get him!

1021
01:11:24,021 --> 01:11:26,980
Calm down, Mr. Lempereur.
You'll give us away.

1022
01:11:27,141 --> 01:11:30,340
- He's a highly trained soldier.
- Visual on the target.

1023
01:11:31,061 --> 01:11:32,700
Doesn't seem highly trained.

1024
01:11:34,741 --> 01:11:36,380
Maybe he already made us.

1025
01:11:36,501 --> 01:11:39,380
Arrest him already.
He might hurt my wife.

1026
01:11:41,861 --> 01:11:43,901
My God! He's raping her!

1027
01:11:44,221 --> 01:11:45,260
Go! This is rape!

1028
01:11:47,221 --> 01:11:49,100
Your wife's not resisting much.

1029
01:11:49,341 --> 01:11:51,020
Sure she's being held captive?

1030
01:11:51,381 --> 01:11:52,980
Stockholm syndrome.

1031
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:54,540
Big T, Stockholm syndrome?

1032
01:11:54,741 --> 01:11:55,901
In 48 hrs? Negative.

1033
01:11:56,541 --> 01:11:58,020
Adultery syndrome.

1034
01:12:01,821 --> 01:12:03,180
What happened? Tell me.

1035
01:12:03,381 --> 01:12:05,501
Why did Dimitri leave you?
You're wounded.

1036
01:12:05,781 --> 01:12:08,420
I must speak you.
Say farewell.

1037
01:12:08,581 --> 01:12:10,621
Too risky now.
I leave forever.

1038
01:12:11,061 --> 01:12:12,421
I'll miss you so much.

1039
01:12:13,941 --> 01:12:15,860
- Farewell.
- Love me one last time.

1040
01:12:17,142 --> 01:12:18,341
All right.

1041
01:12:18,702 --> 01:12:19,661
Police!

1042
01:12:20,862 --> 01:12:22,580
Hands! Show me your hands!

1043
01:12:22,701 --> 01:12:23,501
Don't shoot.

1044
01:12:23,661 --> 01:12:25,220
Run, Anton!

1045
01:12:28,422 --> 01:12:29,461
Not on the carpet!

1046
01:12:31,221 --> 01:12:33,141
Let him go! He's a hero!
Let me go!

1047
01:12:33,342 --> 01:12:34,141
Go! Now!

1048
01:12:35,462 --> 01:12:36,861
Anton, I love you!

1049
01:12:36,982 --> 01:12:38,421
I love you, Anna!

1050
01:12:40,262 --> 01:12:42,781
- I'll get you out.
- Don't bother, my love.

1051
01:12:42,982 --> 01:12:45,981
You can't be extradited.
You face death in Cherkistan.

1052
01:12:53,822 --> 01:12:55,981
Administrative Detention Center

1053
01:12:58,142 --> 01:13:01,141
You're not the first foreigner
who's fluent in French.

1054
01:13:02,982 --> 01:13:05,661
Do I look like a revolutionary?
Jesus!

1055
01:13:05,782 --> 01:13:08,862
I'm not Anton Miroslav.
I'm Romain Faubert.

1056
01:13:12,422 --> 01:13:14,781
Romain Faubert, Anton Miroslav,

1057
01:13:15,062 --> 01:13:17,262
or Jean Valjean? Pick one!

1058
01:13:17,383 --> 01:13:18,661
That's nonsense.

1059
01:13:19,822 --> 01:13:23,022
I swear, I was born July 17, 1973
in the Paris suburbs.

1060
01:13:23,143 --> 01:13:24,141
I was born French.

1061
01:13:24,302 --> 01:13:26,262
- Prove it!
- I lost my ID.

1062
01:13:26,822 --> 01:13:28,062
- Sure.
- I didn't lose it.

1063
01:13:28,423 --> 01:13:30,942
The real Anton Miroslav
took my ID.

1064
01:13:31,342 --> 01:13:32,781
And Jean Valjean?

1065
01:13:33,703 --> 01:13:34,662
Where is he?

1066
01:13:36,142 --> 01:13:37,821
Jean Valjean is no one.

1067
01:13:38,023 --> 01:13:39,302
He's Victor Hugo.

1068
01:13:39,663 --> 01:13:41,181
How many of you are there?

1069
01:13:43,543 --> 01:13:45,021
Who is this Victor Hugo?

1070
01:13:47,302 --> 01:13:48,582
He's the author.

1071
01:13:48,742 --> 01:13:49,902
Of the forged ID's.

1072
01:13:53,302 --> 01:13:53,982
It's simple.

1073
01:13:54,463 --> 01:13:56,382
I posed as Miroslav,

1074
01:13:56,542 --> 01:13:59,302
he posed as me.
You arrested me instead of him.

1075
01:13:59,463 --> 01:14:01,542
He posed as me to enter France.

1076
01:14:01,703 --> 01:14:04,182
I for him,
and Jean Valjean by Victor Hugo,

1077
01:14:04,343 --> 01:14:06,422
for Anna Zvenka,
who's crazy about him.

1078
01:14:06,583 --> 01:14:08,662
Meaning me, because to her I'm him.

1079
01:14:08,823 --> 01:14:12,662
He doesn't care about her or me.
I care about her, not him. Anyway.

1080
01:14:12,823 --> 01:14:14,902
It's her brother's fault,
he took me to Calais.

1081
01:14:15,063 --> 01:14:17,342
He'll tell you
I'm me and not him

1082
01:14:17,503 --> 01:14:20,502
because he's not just her brother
but also my doctor.

1083
01:14:24,183 --> 01:14:27,182
You seem confused.
I feel like I lost you.

1084
01:14:27,703 --> 01:14:28,862
It worries me.

1085
01:14:33,944 --> 01:14:36,662
Hello, yeah.
Got her statement? Show her in.

1086
01:14:37,143 --> 01:14:38,503
- Who?
- Your accomplice.

1087
01:14:41,823 --> 01:14:44,822
This is wrong. He's a hero,
who's saving my homeland.

1088
01:14:44,984 --> 01:14:46,462
Free Cherkistan!

1089
01:14:47,063 --> 01:14:48,502
Forgive me, it's my fault.

1090
01:14:48,743 --> 01:14:49,982
No, it's mine.

1091
01:14:50,264 --> 01:14:51,343
Anna,

1092
01:14:51,464 --> 01:14:52,183
forgive me.

1093
01:14:52,343 --> 01:14:53,943
Can you forgive me one day?

1094
01:14:54,664 --> 01:14:56,103
Your French is so good.

1095
01:14:57,104 --> 01:14:58,743
Yes, I'm not Anton Miroslav.

1096
01:14:59,104 --> 01:15:00,303
He's at my home.

1097
01:15:00,503 --> 01:15:03,142
I'm your brother's patient,
and his friend.

1098
01:15:03,304 --> 01:15:04,942
My name is Romain Faubert.

1099
01:15:05,104 --> 01:15:08,062
I'm a photographer,
for an online medical dictionary.

1100
01:15:08,264 --> 01:15:09,862
Doctoweb. Heard of it?

1101
01:15:10,784 --> 01:15:12,382
I couldn't tell you.

1102
01:15:12,503 --> 01:15:15,783
I loved you at first sight.
I was speechless.

1103
01:15:16,384 --> 01:15:18,783
I was so afraid
you wouldn't love me.

1104
01:15:20,183 --> 01:15:21,503
But you did love me.

1105
01:15:21,904 --> 01:15:24,423
For what I am.
Right, Anna? Just me.

1106
01:15:25,544 --> 01:15:26,943
Oh, don't cry.

1107
01:15:27,544 --> 01:15:29,743
I feel so stupid for lying.

1108
01:15:29,864 --> 01:15:31,103
I hate myself for it.

1109
01:15:31,744 --> 01:15:32,783
Anna, you know,

1110
01:15:32,944 --> 01:15:35,823
even great balloons are burst
with one little prick.

1111
01:15:36,024 --> 01:15:37,223
Ma'am.

1112
01:15:38,384 --> 01:15:40,303
Ma'am, who is this man?

1113
01:15:40,664 --> 01:15:43,383
Miroslav, Faubert,
Victor Valjean or Jean Hugo?

1114
01:15:44,984 --> 01:15:45,903
Anton Miroslav.

1115
01:15:46,384 --> 01:15:48,263
There. Put him on ice.

1116
01:15:48,424 --> 01:15:50,864
Maximum security
until he's deported.

1117
01:15:51,825 --> 01:15:52,784
No, wait!

1118
01:15:52,905 --> 01:15:54,983
Let me go!
I'm not Anton Miroslav!

1119
01:15:57,784 --> 01:16:00,143
You're free, but don't leave France

1120
01:16:00,304 --> 01:16:02,103
pending investigation

1121
01:16:02,265 --> 01:16:05,783
of aiding an illegal immigrant
to enter the country.

1122
01:16:35,745 --> 01:16:36,824
Anton?

1123
01:16:45,305 --> 01:16:48,264
Great. The scar is healing.
Perfect.

1124
01:16:48,665 --> 01:16:50,504
Keep taking the antibiotics.

1125
01:17:00,185 --> 01:17:02,424
Seeing the real one,
I feel so stupid.

1126
01:17:02,585 --> 01:17:04,584
How could I have been so naive?

1127
01:17:04,865 --> 01:17:06,904
- Where's Guillaume?
- His mother's.

1128
01:17:07,065 --> 01:17:07,864
Sorry.

1129
01:17:08,025 --> 01:17:11,664
For what? All we did was argue.
Now things are clear.

1130
01:17:12,105 --> 01:17:14,505
The false Miroslav was your patient?

1131
01:17:14,665 --> 01:17:16,224
Why didn't you tell me?

1132
01:17:17,425 --> 01:17:19,824
Under the bed,
I didn't recognize him.

1133
01:17:19,985 --> 01:17:21,225
Your own patient?

1134
01:17:21,385 --> 01:17:24,744
So many hypochondriacs!
I can't distinguish them all!

1135
01:17:24,905 --> 01:17:25,704
Hypochondriac?

1136
01:17:25,945 --> 01:17:27,424
Like you didn't notice?

1137
01:17:27,586 --> 01:17:29,745
Liar, impostor, crook,

1138
01:17:29,866 --> 01:17:32,424
freeloader, sure.
Not hypochondriac.

1139
01:17:32,705 --> 01:17:33,744
He did make me...

1140
01:17:33,905 --> 01:17:36,624
No! No details.
Please, I don't want to know.

1141
01:17:37,505 --> 01:17:40,145
No images!

1142
01:17:41,545 --> 01:17:45,105
I'll call and have him released.
Then he'll be gone forever.

1143
01:17:45,226 --> 01:17:47,825
Wait a while.
They won't look for the real one.

1144
01:17:47,986 --> 01:17:50,544
I'm glad he's locked up
after what he put me through.

1145
01:17:50,706 --> 01:17:51,825
- Romain Faubert!
- Me, too.

1146
01:17:51,946 --> 01:17:53,705
Romain Faubert?

1147
01:17:57,826 --> 01:17:59,465
Miroslav, visitor.

1148
01:18:02,106 --> 01:18:03,505
No, I'm Romain Faubert.

1149
01:18:03,666 --> 01:18:05,265
Get over here!

1150
01:18:06,226 --> 01:18:08,425
This cell is very unsanitary.

1151
01:18:08,586 --> 01:18:09,465
Have it cleaned.

1152
01:18:09,666 --> 01:18:10,985
Then I'll shine your shoes!

1153
01:18:11,106 --> 01:18:12,905
No, thanks. Just the cell.

1154
01:18:23,066 --> 01:18:24,425
I'm your lawyer.

1155
01:18:25,506 --> 01:18:27,345
Any hand sanitizer, counselor?

1156
01:18:27,706 --> 01:18:28,865
I think I...

1157
01:18:35,306 --> 01:18:36,625
That how you say it?

1158
01:18:37,187 --> 01:18:38,345
I'm not Cherkistani.

1159
01:18:38,546 --> 01:18:40,186
- I know.
- Who told you?

1160
01:18:40,506 --> 01:18:41,545
You all say it.

1161
01:18:41,706 --> 01:18:44,665
You all lost your ID,
you ate your passport.

1162
01:18:44,826 --> 01:18:46,186
You forgot your homeland.

1163
01:18:46,506 --> 01:18:50,146
No, I didn't. I was born here.
In Issy-les-Moulineaux.

1164
01:18:52,346 --> 01:18:53,986
- Where?
- Issy-les-Moulineaux.

1165
01:18:54,266 --> 01:18:56,225
Yeah, that's original.

1166
01:18:56,387 --> 01:18:59,185
France won't extradite you
to the Paris suburbs.

1167
01:19:00,186 --> 01:19:01,066
Too close.

1168
01:19:02,707 --> 01:19:04,386
The suburbs are too close.

1169
01:19:04,826 --> 01:19:05,586
Never mind.

1170
01:19:05,747 --> 01:19:08,506
This is an enormous mistake.
Get me out of here.

1171
01:19:08,666 --> 01:19:09,946
You're leaving.

1172
01:19:10,547 --> 01:19:11,106
I'm free?

1173
01:19:11,507 --> 01:19:15,226
No, but your death sentence
has been commuted to life in prison.

1174
01:19:15,386 --> 01:19:17,466
- You won't be hanged.
- I'm being deported?

1175
01:19:18,626 --> 01:19:19,906
It's happening today.

1176
01:19:20,186 --> 01:19:23,226
We can argue that once you get there
you'll be tortured.

1177
01:19:23,387 --> 01:19:24,706
And stop the deportation?

1178
01:19:25,027 --> 01:19:27,586
No, but we'll show we didn't agree.

1179
01:19:30,707 --> 01:19:33,426
- Any kids in France?
- No, no kids.

1180
01:19:33,587 --> 01:19:35,106
I made love with no condom.

1181
01:19:35,307 --> 01:19:37,626
No. That's not enough, Mr. Miroslav.

1182
01:19:37,827 --> 01:19:41,026
Faubert. Listen,
contact Dimitri Zvenka.

1183
01:19:41,187 --> 01:19:42,346
- Your coyote?
- My doctor.

1184
01:19:42,907 --> 01:19:44,186
He's known me forever.

1185
01:19:44,427 --> 01:19:46,826
He'll testify, they'll let me go.

1186
01:19:47,027 --> 01:19:49,866
In detention,
you can have no outside contact.

1187
01:19:50,027 --> 01:19:52,026
- Even with police?
- Why the police?

1188
01:19:52,187 --> 01:19:53,867
My doctor reported me missing.

1189
01:19:54,347 --> 01:19:56,706
Find the cops
with the missing persons file.

1190
01:20:00,507 --> 01:20:03,426
Sorry. We must find the cops
who are looking for you.

1191
01:20:03,588 --> 01:20:06,467
Yeah, look for them
so they can find me.

1192
01:20:08,107 --> 01:20:11,027
I'm happy to see you.
You can't know how happy!

1193
01:20:15,187 --> 01:20:18,107
Now, you say you know
where Romain Faubert is?

1194
01:20:18,307 --> 01:20:20,627
Sure, right here. That's me.

1195
01:20:23,067 --> 01:20:24,827
I'm not here to get screwed with.

1196
01:20:25,028 --> 01:20:27,667
I'm not screwing with you.
I'm Romain Faubert!

1197
01:20:29,028 --> 01:20:29,707
Easy!

1198
01:20:29,907 --> 01:20:32,347
This guy's used to
Eastern European tactics.

1199
01:20:32,508 --> 01:20:34,466
What did you do with Faubert?

1200
01:20:37,107 --> 01:20:38,827
That's enough, lighten up.

1201
01:20:38,948 --> 01:20:41,947
- A man's life is in danger.
- My life is in danger.

1202
01:20:42,108 --> 01:20:43,987
I don't want to be deported.

1203
01:20:44,187 --> 01:20:46,267
Give us Faubert, we'll suspend it.

1204
01:20:46,428 --> 01:20:47,107
Where is he?

1205
01:20:48,068 --> 01:20:50,387
He's right there, look!
The reflection.

1206
01:20:50,508 --> 01:20:51,467
That's him!

1207
01:20:51,628 --> 01:20:54,987
Romain Faubert, come here!
We're all looking for you!

1208
01:20:57,148 --> 01:20:59,347
He's a tough one. Very tough.

1209
01:20:59,828 --> 01:21:02,027
They're deporting Anton Miroslav

1210
01:21:02,188 --> 01:21:04,387
a Cherkistani
from the Paris suburbs.

1211
01:21:04,548 --> 01:21:07,907
Is it necessary to deport
a dangerous criminal?

1212
01:21:08,068 --> 01:21:09,867
A terrorist, who loves France

1213
01:21:10,028 --> 01:21:11,587
who was assimilating nicely.

1214
01:21:12,428 --> 01:21:13,507
Dimitri!

1215
01:21:17,068 --> 01:21:18,228
Be right back.

1216
01:21:19,388 --> 01:21:20,427
What did you do?!

1217
01:21:20,588 --> 01:21:22,987
I called,
but he'd already been deported.

1218
01:21:23,708 --> 01:21:25,987
Let's just call
the French Embassy there.

1219
01:21:26,828 --> 01:21:29,427
The Embassy in Drassjna
closed in 2003.

1220
01:21:29,588 --> 01:21:32,547
France has no ties
with the Cherkistani dictatorship.

1221
01:21:32,948 --> 01:21:34,428
Shit. What do we do?

1222
01:21:36,148 --> 01:21:37,188
- Miroslav.
- What?

1223
01:21:38,108 --> 01:21:39,187
Faubert...

1224
01:21:40,108 --> 01:21:41,148
problem.

1225
01:21:42,508 --> 01:21:44,067
Oh yes, problem.

1226
01:22:18,469 --> 01:22:19,748
Miroslav! Miroslav!

1227
01:22:52,190 --> 01:22:53,828
Finally, a smart person.

1228
01:23:00,309 --> 01:23:02,228
Brother?
No, I'm not his brother!

1229
01:23:07,149 --> 01:23:08,548
Romain Faubert.

1230
01:23:09,629 --> 01:23:10,989
I'm not Sergei!

1231
01:23:11,189 --> 01:23:14,629
Romain Faubert, not Sergei!
I don't know him.

1232
01:23:19,750 --> 01:23:21,229
Let me go.

1233
01:23:21,910 --> 01:23:23,668
I'm a French hypochondriac.

1234
01:23:23,830 --> 01:23:25,468
I'm too fragile to be here!

1235
01:23:25,630 --> 01:23:27,829
Please!
Send me back to Paris.

1236
01:23:32,669 --> 01:23:34,989
Lord, God. I understand now.

1237
01:23:35,190 --> 01:23:37,789
Stop this nightmare,
I'll never lie again.

1238
01:24:27,910 --> 01:24:29,390
I'm running a fever.

1239
01:24:30,831 --> 01:24:32,870
I'm sick and I have no Google.

1240
01:24:37,710 --> 01:24:39,110
There's no wi-fi?

1241
01:24:46,710 --> 01:24:50,510
I have to take my picture
for the "Eastern Europe Virus" page.

1242
01:25:27,232 --> 01:25:28,830
There's no water!

1243
01:25:47,071 --> 01:25:49,950
They'll catch us.
They're going to catch us.

1244
01:25:52,951 --> 01:25:54,071
You'll give us away.

1245
01:25:54,712 --> 01:25:56,310
Why do you get so excited?

1246
01:25:56,472 --> 01:25:59,951
You're forbidden to travel.
He's their most wanted rebel.

1247
01:26:00,151 --> 01:26:01,350
Why?!

1248
01:26:06,072 --> 01:26:07,710
What kind of name is that?!

1249
01:26:07,912 --> 01:26:10,590
What? it's a very French name.

1250
01:26:18,592 --> 01:26:20,391
Cyrano Da Bergerac?

1251
01:27:01,832 --> 01:27:02,791
Leave me some.

1252
01:27:19,793 --> 01:27:21,912
I can't believe this. I'm a doctor.

1253
01:27:22,073 --> 01:27:23,352
With Cherkistani roots!

1254
01:27:23,552 --> 01:27:26,671
Not every Cherkistani doctor
breaks patients out of jail!

1255
01:27:26,833 --> 01:27:28,152
Too late to back out!

1256
01:27:33,632 --> 01:27:35,472
Why go? There are 5 of them!

1257
01:27:35,593 --> 01:27:37,352
It's our fault he's here!

1258
01:27:37,472 --> 01:27:39,512
You mean that's the only reason?

1259
01:28:13,713 --> 01:28:15,632
I missed you so much.

1260
01:28:16,833 --> 01:28:17,712
He's feverish.

1261
01:28:17,833 --> 01:28:19,433
Who cares?

1262
01:28:19,593 --> 01:28:21,992
I caught everything,
I have no more fear.

1263
01:28:22,194 --> 01:28:23,513
Germs are my friends.

1264
01:28:23,833 --> 01:28:25,112
He's not well.

1265
01:28:25,273 --> 01:28:27,192
Anna, you're here? Big hug!

1266
01:28:28,314 --> 01:28:30,233
- Who's he again?
- Anton Miroslav.

1267
01:28:30,354 --> 01:28:33,353
The real one.
He came to replace me. How nice.

1268
01:28:33,513 --> 01:28:34,753
Let's go.

1269
01:29:13,074 --> 01:29:14,193
Dimitri, run!

1270
01:29:26,634 --> 01:29:27,953
Anna, stay there!

1271
01:29:28,594 --> 01:29:29,394
Faubert! No!

1272
01:29:54,115 --> 01:29:55,674
Dimitri, are you all right?

1273
01:30:07,995 --> 01:30:09,993
- They shot me in the back!
- It's OK!

1274
01:30:10,114 --> 01:30:12,033
- I'll die in Cherkistan!
- No!

1275
01:30:12,235 --> 01:30:14,274
Dimitri, do something!
He saved you!

1276
01:30:14,475 --> 01:30:16,233
I'm wounded, too! I can't move.

1277
01:30:20,314 --> 01:30:23,194
I'm cold, Anna.
I can't feel my legs.

1278
01:30:23,355 --> 01:30:26,074
It'll be all right.
We'll get you home, and well.

1279
01:30:26,235 --> 01:30:26,994
Don't move me!

1280
01:30:50,635 --> 01:30:51,434
Listen to me.

1281
01:30:52,155 --> 01:30:55,274
I don't want to see my boring life
flash before my eyes.

1282
01:30:55,436 --> 01:30:59,234
It's your face. I want to see
your face one last time.

1283
01:31:01,515 --> 01:31:03,235
Smile. Stop crying.

1284
01:31:03,435 --> 01:31:06,074
Smile for me, I beg you.
That's it.

1285
01:31:06,675 --> 01:31:09,914
You're stunning right now.
You move me.

1286
01:31:10,355 --> 01:31:12,994
The woman of my dreams.
Even if it's all over now.

1287
01:31:13,196 --> 01:31:15,874
Don't say that.
You're going to live, my love.

1288
01:31:16,035 --> 01:31:17,434
It's too late.

1289
01:31:17,595 --> 01:31:18,874
You called me love?

1290
01:31:20,475 --> 01:31:22,635
- I love you, Anna.
- I love you, too.

1291
01:31:22,876 --> 01:31:25,075
Kiss me one last time.

1292
01:31:33,836 --> 01:31:35,074
One more time.

1293
01:31:39,356 --> 01:31:40,635
Anna...

1294
01:31:41,276 --> 01:31:42,754
the final kiss.

1295
01:31:50,836 --> 01:31:51,555
What?

1296
01:31:52,876 --> 01:31:55,235
- What is it?
- You're not hurt!

1297
01:31:55,916 --> 01:31:59,195
Don't hit me, wait.
I swear I felt I was slipping away.

1298
01:31:59,356 --> 01:32:00,155
Nothing!

1299
01:32:00,316 --> 01:32:02,075
I do have a fever!

1300
01:32:02,716 --> 01:32:04,395
I saved your brother, Jeez!

1301
01:32:41,877 --> 01:32:42,956
What now?

1302
01:32:43,116 --> 01:32:45,635
No, nothing. We're all set.

1303
01:32:45,917 --> 01:32:48,515
- You OK to travel?
- Yes, fine.

1304
01:32:52,197 --> 01:32:52,756
What now?!

1305
01:32:55,157 --> 01:32:57,515
You came to Cherkistan for me.

1306
01:32:57,717 --> 01:33:01,036
I didn't deserve it.
After all I put you two through.

1307
01:33:01,716 --> 01:33:03,836
No one ever risked his life for me.

1308
01:33:04,197 --> 01:33:07,476
And I was too afraid to risk mine.
I feel so stupid.

1309
01:33:07,877 --> 01:33:09,356
And so grateful.

1310
01:33:09,517 --> 01:33:10,636
That's all.

1311
01:33:21,037 --> 01:33:23,956
Don't tell me
you're in love with that maniac?

1312
01:33:24,917 --> 01:33:25,916
My worst patient!

1313
01:33:26,037 --> 01:33:28,556
I'll introduce you to others,
not as sick.

1314
01:33:28,717 --> 01:33:29,796
Not that one.

1315
01:33:29,957 --> 01:33:32,276
I've been his doctor 18 years.

1316
01:33:32,437 --> 01:33:34,636
And for 18 years,
he's made me sick.

1317
01:33:40,877 --> 01:33:42,477
Dank ya, Anton.

1318
01:33:43,918 --> 01:33:45,957
Dank ya, Romain.

1319
01:33:46,357 --> 01:33:49,636
Great men are the ones who have heart.

1320
01:33:54,077 --> 01:33:55,156
Look.

1321
01:33:56,197 --> 01:33:59,076
The real Miroslav is so handsome!
That's a real man.

1322
01:33:59,597 --> 01:34:00,477
Look at him.

1323
01:34:00,757 --> 01:34:02,916
You can see the difference. Look!

1324
01:34:03,077 --> 01:34:04,637
Not even close, right?

1325
01:34:04,918 --> 01:34:07,956
He's Cherkistani, like Grandpa.
And besides...

1326
01:34:17,878 --> 01:34:19,157
Oh shit.

1327
01:34:19,837 --> 01:34:21,876
That's how I met
the woman of my dreams.

1328
01:34:22,038 --> 01:34:23,196
Crazy story, right?

1329
01:34:25,357 --> 01:34:28,077
Even crazier
was explaining to the judge

1330
01:34:28,237 --> 01:34:32,437
that I was arrested as Jean Valjean
and deported as Anton Miroslav,

1331
01:34:32,598 --> 01:34:35,157
who returned to Cherkistan
as Cyrano de Bergerac.

1332
01:34:35,318 --> 01:34:36,597
Not very legal.

1333
01:34:36,758 --> 01:34:38,677
But the French police wasn't proud

1334
01:34:38,838 --> 01:34:41,797
of issuing an arrest warrant
in the name of Victor Hugo,

1335
01:34:41,958 --> 01:34:44,037
so we finally reached a settlement.

1336
01:34:44,238 --> 01:34:45,597
I did nothing wrong!

1337
01:35:05,039 --> 01:35:09,637
At my wedding I thought of Marc,
who would've been so proud of me.

1338
01:35:09,758 --> 01:35:12,677
Married at 40, man.
Fantastic.

1339
01:35:12,839 --> 01:35:15,637
Especially that mandatory
pre-nuptial blood test.

1340
01:35:16,559 --> 01:35:19,957
The only problem I didn't foresee
about getting married

1341
01:35:20,118 --> 01:35:23,998
is you must kiss everyone
and everyone wants to kiss you.

1342
01:35:25,038 --> 01:35:27,157
But there it is, I was cured.

1343
01:35:27,719 --> 01:35:30,757
Divorced from my medicines
and married for real.

1344
01:35:31,799 --> 01:35:32,718
Dimitri!

1345
01:35:34,238 --> 01:35:36,037
You're right,
we're no longer friends!

1346
01:35:36,199 --> 01:35:38,358
- Oh?
- We're brothers-in-law!

1347
01:35:38,479 --> 01:35:40,477
My doctor is now
my brother-in-law!

1348
01:35:43,238 --> 01:35:44,238
My sister-in-law!

1349
01:35:44,519 --> 01:35:46,278
- I'll call you Nora now?
- Sure.

1350
01:35:48,998 --> 01:35:49,998
Come, my love.

1351
01:35:54,199 --> 01:35:57,038
So... we won't hear from him again?

1352
01:35:57,239 --> 01:35:58,558
We won't see him often.

1353
01:35:59,879 --> 01:36:01,318
- Pretty clear.
- What?

1354
01:36:01,479 --> 01:36:05,118
You couldn't sleep with him,
so you foisted him on your sister.

1355
01:36:09,959 --> 01:36:11,838
Told you not to marry a shrink!

1356
01:36:12,799 --> 01:36:13,958
You never listen to Mom!

1357
01:36:16,679 --> 01:36:17,478
Come on, Mom.

1358
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:25,079
The end

1359
01:36:27,039 --> 01:36:28,358
of the pregnancy

1360
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,438
Pregnancy Giving birth

1361
01:36:33,960 --> 01:36:35,118
Push, push.

1362
01:36:36,559 --> 01:36:38,639
You can see the head!

1363
01:36:40,959 --> 01:36:42,278
Just one more push.

1364
01:36:44,959 --> 01:36:46,519
Diaper Rash

1365
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:58,279
Sandbox Hygiene

1366
01:37:03,560 --> 01:37:05,678
Spring Allergies

1367
01:37:12,200 --> 01:37:14,519
Foot bath
Staying Clean in the Pool

1368
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:22,359
Don't worry. We back up
and jump it on 3, OK?

1369
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:25,399
One, two...

1370
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:26,799
Three!

1371
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:29,879
Save my child!

1372
01:37:30,040 --> 01:37:31,679
How long was he underwater?

1373
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:33,199
He wasn't underwater.

1374
01:37:33,680 --> 01:37:35,839
- Didn't drown?
- Slipped in the foot bath!

1375
01:37:36,040 --> 01:37:38,199
He drank a sip of foot bath juice!

1376
01:37:38,360 --> 01:37:41,319
- A sip of water is all?
- All?! Foot bath juice!

1377
01:37:41,680 --> 01:37:43,719
Where people stick disgusting feet!

1378
01:37:43,880 --> 01:37:46,119
What kind of retarded paramedics
are you?

1379
01:37:50,920 --> 01:37:53,319
Paramedics
aren't what they used to be.

1380
01:37:53,480 --> 01:37:56,520
- Know where Dad's taking you?
- To Uncle Dimitri's!

1381
01:37:56,680 --> 01:37:57,960
You're so bright, hon.
