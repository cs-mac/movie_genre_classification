00:11:18,127 --> 00:11:20,880
who has finally got
his Hot-Wiring badge

160
00:11:20,927 --> 00:11:23,521
and his Advanced Swearing badge.

161
00:11:23,567 --> 00:11:27,480
- Shit off, you hairy dog's cock.
- Respect.

162
00:11:27,527 --> 00:11:32,078
Since you has got your fifth badge,
you has earned your second slit.

163
00:11:34,167 --> 00:11:37,603
Hopefully one day
you'll get to be Tyrone's level.

164
00:11:37,647 --> 00:11:41,526
If you gets any better,
we'll have to start doing your pubes.

165
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:46,004
- I don't have any.
- Well, I is got millions.

166
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:50,086
Now, remember -
without realness, we is nothing.

167
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:53,380
So, posse, keep it real!

168
00:11:53,427 --> 00:11:55,418
(All chant) Keep it real!

169
00:11:58,547 --> 00:12:02,938
On the streets, your homie
would take a cap in his ass for you.

170
00:12:02,987 --> 00:12:07,822
So let's start with
a very basic trust exercise.

171
00:12:09,367 --> 00:12:13,883
- One, two, three.
- Ali, can I have a word?

172
00:12:13,927 --> 00:12:18,079
- Sure.
- It's about the centre.

173
00:12:18,627 --> 00:12:21,903
I know how much these classes
mean to you

174
00:12:21,947 --> 00:12:25,656
- and how much the kids enjoy them.
- (Groaning)

175
00:12:25,707 --> 00:12:28,938
But the government's withdrawn
our funding.

176
00:12:29,487 --> 00:12:33,446
They're closing down
the John Nike Leisure Centre.

177
00:12:36,087 --> 00:12:40,444
You what? How is these kids meant
to make it out of the ghetto now?

178
00:12:40,487 --> 00:12:44,116
- They'll have to go somewhere else.
- Somewhere else?

179
00:12:44,167 --> 00:12:47,921
Do you know what this centre
means to them? And to me?

180
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:51,755
This is the spiritual home
of the West Staines Massiv.

181
00:12:51,807 --> 00:12:54,605
This is like what Mecca is
to the Jews.

182
00:12:54,647 --> 00:12:57,605
It's like what Kentucky is
to chickens.

183
00:12:57,647 --> 00:13:02,277
And it was here when me
first felt me Julie's... (Whistles)

184
00:13:03,827 --> 00:13:07,376
Ali, there's nothing you can do.

185
00:13:07,427 --> 00:13:10,783
Now, you better go and tell the kids.

186
00:13:29,307 --> 00:13:32,822
I ain't never gonna let them
close us down.

187
00:13:32,867 --> 00:13:35,301
Keep it real, yeah?

188
00:13:39,247 --> 00:13:42,557
(Woman) 'Dinner with
the Belgian prime minister at eight.

189
00:13:42,607 --> 00:13:46,202
'And the Deputy Prime Minister
wishes to speak to you.'

190
00:13:46,247 --> 00:13:50,081
- Has he heard the poll results yet?
- Yes, I wish I hadn't.

191
00:13:50,127 --> 00:13:52,163
Gallup puts us 22 points behind.

192
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:54,562
- And MORI?
- 23 points behind.

193
00:13:54,607 --> 00:13:57,405
The youth vote's
deserting us in droves.

194
00:13:57,447 --> 00:13:59,836
Focus groups say we're out of touch.

195
00:13:59,887 --> 00:14:01,764
- We are.
- Don't be silly.

196
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:03,798
Will we lose this by-election?

197
00:14:03,847 --> 00:14:08,045
We haven't lost Staines in 20 years
and we're not about to start.

198
00:14:08,087 --> 00:14:09,884
We just have an image problem.

199
00:14:09,927 --> 00:14:13,636
We have to find a candidate
who will improve that image.

200
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:15,757
Somebody young.

201
00:14:16,807 --> 00:14:19,401
- Somebody ethnic.
- Somebody in touch.

202
00:14:19,447 --> 00:14:21,517
- Exactly.
- You're right.

203
00:14:21,567 --> 00:14:26,800
We need an intellectually superior
candidate to guarantee us victory.

204
00:14:27,487 --> 00:14:29,637
- Easy now, Mrs Hugh.
- Booyakasha.

205
00:14:29,687 --> 00:14:32,918
- Is me Julie about?
- She's upstairs.

206
00:14:33,967 --> 00:14:37,926
Hello, baby, I's been missing you
so much today.

207
00:14:38,467 --> 00:14:42,904
You is looking so fine. All I want
to do is pull your panties down...

208
00:14:43,447 --> 00:14:45,199
Ali.

209
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:48,080
- Hello, me Julie.
- Stop feeling up Nina.

210
00:14:48,627 --> 00:14:52,302
- I got confused.
- You're never confused with Tracey.

211
00:14:52,347 --> 00:14:55,862
- Hello, Ali.
- Hello.

212
00:14:55,907 --> 00:14:57,898
You know you is me only bitch.

213
00:14:57,947 --> 00:15:00,177
Ho. Lady?

214
00:15:00,227 --> 00:15:03,697
When me close me eyes,
you is the only girl me think about.

215
00:15:03,747 --> 00:15:06,307
# Gal flex, time to have sex

216
00:15:07,187 --> 00:15:09,143
# Jump in my Lex, steam a blunt,
pop a vex

217
00:15:09,187 --> 00:15:11,257
# Now you know that my style
is rated XX... #

218
00:15:11,307 --> 00:15:15,539
- Ali, open your eyes.
- Sorry, there was something in them.

219
00:15:15,587 --> 00:15:18,545
Because there's these fleas
going around,

220
00:15:18,587 --> 00:15:22,660
two of them, coming in again
and they're in me eyes!

221
00:15:23,207 --> 00:15:25,641
# Open up dem legs a-wider... #

222
00:15:25,687 --> 00:15:28,804
You've been a very bad boy
and you need to be punished.

223
00:15:28,847 --> 00:15:31,805
- Are you a bad boy?
- Yes, I am.

224
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:34,236
My skin is so dry.

225
00:15:34,787 --> 00:15:38,257
So for being a bad boy,
I want you to rub oil into me,

226
00:15:38,807 --> 00:15:42,686
paying special attention
to my breasts and my batty crease.

227
00:15:43,227 --> 00:15:45,866
OK, I will do that.

228
00:15:45,907 --> 00:15:50,139
But first, I want you to
take your hat off, you naughty boy.

229
00:15:50,187 --> 00:15:52,178
But me never take me hat off.

230
00:15:52,227 --> 00:15:54,695
You take that off
and I'll take these off.

231
00:15:55,247 --> 00:15:57,317
OK.

232
00:16:03,207 --> 00:16:05,721
Now I'm going to milk you.

233
00:16:05,767 --> 00:16:08,520
- (Julie) 'Ali.'
- Give me one more sec.

234
00:16:09,067 --> 00:16:12,343
- Behave, Alistair.
- J-Lo.

235
00:16:12,887 --> 00:16:15,117
They is closing down the centre.

236
00:16:15,167 --> 00:16:19,399
I is gonna go on hunger strike
until they save it...or until I die.

237
00:16:19,947 --> 00:16:24,941
So just in case I do join Tupac
and Biggie in that ghetto in the sky,

238
00:16:24,987 --> 00:16:28,263
I's come here to bone you
one last time.

239
00:16:28,307 --> 00:16:30,980
Mr Johnson might have something
to say about that.

240
00:16:31,027 --> 00:16:33,825
- Can I watch?
- I got not problem with that.

241
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:35,539
Ali!

242
00:16:35,587 --> 00:16:38,181
Don't do nothing stupid, all right?

243
00:16:45,227 --> 00:16:48,105
Hear me now.
She ain't really me Julie.

244
00:16:48,147 --> 00:16:51,617
In real life I is going out
with someone much fitter.

245
00:16:51,667 --> 00:16:54,898
But they do that
to make me more accessible.

246
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:59,259
Which means you girls think I will
knob you, even if you is a minger.

247
00:17:06,827 --> 00:17:09,500
OK, you got ten seconds
till you start.

248
00:17:09,547 --> 00:17:11,538
(Muffled) More! More!

249
00:17:13,147 --> 00:17:15,820
OK, and go.

250
00:17:15,867 --> 00:17:18,176
Mr G, why are you on hunger strike?

251
00:17:18,227 --> 00:17:20,900
(Muffled) In the struggle for...

252
00:17:22,507 --> 00:17:26,819
In the struggle for justice,
I is willing to lay down me life.

253
00:17:27,367 --> 00:17:31,201
Just like
Martin Luther...Vandross did.

254
00:17:34,267 --> 00:17:38,260
Local party chairman Alan Swan
has some names for the by-election.

255
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:41,299
This is a great honour.
I've always admired...

256
00:17:41,347 --> 00:17:45,545
- The names, Swan.
- Right. Well, er...

257
00:17:45,587 --> 00:17:50,980
There are three really outstanding
candidates that match your criteria.

258
00:17:51,527 --> 00:17:55,566
Top of the list is Andrew Hamilton,
PhD political science,

259
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:58,485
studied PPE at Oxford,
gained a starred first.

260
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:01,041
Have you tried these new
chicken dippers?

261
00:18:01,587 --> 00:18:05,216
- They're really good.
- What sauce are you going for?

262
00:18:05,767 --> 00:18:07,325
I think it's barbecue.

263
00:18:07,367 --> 00:18:09,437
(Roars and moans)

264
00:18:15,347 --> 00:18:17,542
I can't take it!

265
00:18:19,087 --> 00:18:21,282
(Ali roars)

266
00:18:26,547 --> 00:18:28,936
Chicken dippers!

267
00:18:31,547 --> 00:18:34,505
- Good, we can go home now.
- Oh, nips.

268
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:36,777
I'll get the keys, yeah?

269
00:18:36,827 --> 00:18:39,899
Starting again from...now!

270
00:18:39,947 --> 00:18:43,144
# Bring it! What? We right here... #

271
00:18:44,147 --> 00:18:46,183
No.

272
00:18:47,227 --> 00:18:51,186
# We right here,
this is ours and we don't share #

273
00:18:51,227 --> 00:18:55,459
- What has we got here, then?
- I is doing a serious protest.

274
00:18:56,007 --> 00:18:58,646
In that case, we'll leave you to it.

275
00:18:59,187 --> 00:19:01,826
Oh, thanks.

276
00:19:01,867 --> 00:19:04,176
There was just one thing, though.

277
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:07,859
(All laughing)

278
00:19:08,407 --> 00:19:11,080
# ...joint made this year
that'll knock till 2003

279
00:19:11,127 --> 00:19:14,164
# Y'all gonna see
that the hottest nigger out there

280
00:19:14,207 --> 00:19:17,756
# Was and will be me
# Just like that

281
00:19:17,807 --> 00:19:19,206
# I can go away for a minute

282
00:19:19,247 --> 00:19:21,715
# Do some other shit
but bounce right back... #

283
00:19:21,767 --> 00:19:23,837
(Disappointed groan)

284
00:19:23,887 --> 00:19:28,483
Grow, Biggie, grow.
I has gotta get a semi lob-on.

285
00:19:28,527 --> 00:19:30,643
Jennifer Lopez, Jennifer Lopez.

286
00:19:32,767 --> 00:19:37,795
Jennifer Lopez lezzing off with the
big-thighed one in Destiny's Child.

287
00:19:43,987 --> 00:19:46,820
Look here now!
Look at my massive beast!

288
00:19:46,867 --> 00:19:49,062
(All screaming)

289
00:19:49,607 --> 00:19:52,041
You filthy animal!

290
00:20:03,407 --> 00:20:06,558
(lrish accent)
Oh, Shep, this rail is very dirty.

291
00:20:06,607 --> 00:20:09,121
It's going to need
a lot of polishing.

292
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:10,998
(Moaning)

293
00:20:11,047 --> 00:20:14,881
PhD in economics,
three years at Harvard, age 34...

294
00:20:14,927 --> 00:20:17,964
Swan? Is there any reason
why there should be

295
00:20:18,007 --> 00:20:21,795
an absurdly dressed,
half-naked man chained to a fence

296
00:20:21,847 --> 00:20:25,237
being tossed off
by an old, blind council worker?

297
00:20:26,007 --> 00:20:27,759
(Ali moaning)

298
00:20:28,807 --> 00:20:34,006
Ignore him. It's the local idiot
making some pathetic protest.

299
00:20:34,047 --> 00:20:36,322
Unchain him and bring him in here.

300
00:20:36,367 --> 00:20:38,881
- But I'm trying to...
- Bring him in, Swan.

301
00:20:42,567 --> 00:20:45,365
Straight ahead
at the top of the stairs.

302
00:20:46,927 --> 00:20:50,715
# Freak me, baby
# Yeah, just like that

303
00:20:50,767 --> 00:20:53,156
# Freak me, baby
# Come on, come on

304
00:20:53,287 --> 00:20:56,085
# Freak me, baby

305
00:20:56,127 --> 00:20:58,925
# Let me lick you up and down

306
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:01,401
# Till you say stop

307
00:21:02,767 --> 00:21:05,645
# Let me play with your body, baby

308
00:21:05,687 --> 00:21:07,757
# Make you real hot #

309
00:21:09,407 --> 00:21:14,879
# Let me do all the tings
you want me to do

310
00:21:17,487 --> 00:21:23,403
# Cos tonight, baby,
I wanna get freaky with you #

311
00:21:25,607 --> 00:21:29,680
I'm Kate Hedges, the Deputy
Prime Minister's secretary.

312
00:21:29,727 --> 00:21:32,639
Come in
and you can pull your pants up now.

313
00:21:38,487 --> 00:21:42,036
Hello, I'm David Carlton,
the Deputy Prime Minister.

314
00:21:42,087 --> 00:21:45,966
Hello.
I is Ali G, the dominating MC.

315
00:21:46,007 --> 00:21:48,919
Making bitches touch their punani.

316
00:21:48,967 --> 00:21:52,198
- The number after two, it be...
- Three.

317
00:21:52,247 --> 00:21:55,478
Not Ali A, not Ali B,
not Ali C, not Ali D,

318
00:21:55,527 --> 00:21:57,119
not Ali...

319
00:21:58,247 --> 00:22:00,397
E...

320
00:22:00,447 --> 00:22:02,438
not Ali...

321
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,603
(Hums alphabet song)

322
00:22:04,647 --> 00:22:06,319
F...

323
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:08,198
- but Ali...
- G.

324
00:22:08,247 --> 00:22:11,922
Bo! Your rhymes is tight
for a honkey, yes, sir.

325
00:22:11,967 --> 00:22:14,401
That's his full name and address.

326
00:22:14,447 --> 00:22:16,517
Tell me, Ali, do you have a job?

327
00:22:16,567 --> 00:22:19,320
I is recently gone on the dole.

328
00:22:19,407 --> 00:22:22,399
- When?
- Eight years and three months ago.

329
00:22:22,447 --> 00:22:25,644
It says here you claim disability.
Are you...?

330
00:22:25,687 --> 00:22:28,997
Yes, I is actually spasticated.

331
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:31,197
I is got a terrible DJing injury

332
00:22:31,247 --> 00:22:34,444
and still ain't got full mobility
in me mixing finger.

333
00:22:34,487 --> 00:22:37,399
Fok-chickety-fok-fok-fresh. Ow.

334
00:22:37,947 --> 00:22:41,940
Everything down there
is still working. Oh, yes. Yes.

335
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:47,265
Ali, erm...would you sit down?
Please, sit down.

336
00:22:50,927 --> 00:22:55,796
- Would you ever become an MP?
- What for? It's full of pricks.

337
00:22:56,347 --> 00:22:59,976
That's a little harsh.
I'm an MP, am I a prick?

338
00:23:00,527 --> 00:23:04,361
- Yes.
- Let's try a different angle.

339
00:23:06,047 --> 00:23:08,402
Is there nothing
you'd like to change?

340
00:23:08,447 --> 00:23:12,235
Me'd wanna save the John Nike
Leisure Centre, obviously.

341
00:23:12,287 --> 00:23:15,563
As the MP for Staines,
you could achieve that.

342
00:23:15,607 --> 00:23:17,996
Would you stand in this by-election?

343
00:23:18,547 --> 00:23:21,186
Me gotta be honest,
me ain't actually bi.

344
00:23:21,727 --> 00:23:23,718
- Well...
- I mean,

345
00:23:23,767 --> 00:23:25,917
obviously I done it with two girls.

346
00:23:25,967 --> 00:23:27,958
Well, I seen it on the internet.

347
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:33,058
But me would never feel completely
comfortable being bummed by a man.

348
00:23:33,107 --> 00:23:35,223
A lot of people say never say ever

349
00:23:35,267 --> 00:23:39,055
but me feel strongly that me
exit hole should stay me exit hole

350
00:23:39,107 --> 00:23:42,702
and never become me entry hole,
you know what I is saying?

351
00:23:42,747 --> 00:23:45,307
Yes, yes.

352
00:23:45,847 --> 00:23:48,680
Well, it's been
a pleasure meeting you.

353
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:52,060
David.

354
00:23:55,127 --> 00:23:56,879
Later, sweetheart.

355
00:24:12,487 --> 00:24:14,762
(Kate) David?

356
00:24:14,807 --> 00:24:18,720
What are you doing? He was
the biggest idiot I have ever met.

357
00:24:18,767 --> 00:24:22,646
- Choose him and we'll never win.
- I know.

358
00:24:22,687 --> 00:24:26,441
There'll be a leadership crisis.
The PM will be out.

359
00:24:26,487 --> 00:24:29,081
And who could possibly replace him?

360
00:24:32,027 --> 00:24:35,940
Ali has two weeks
to lose us 18,000 votes.

361
00:24:36,487 --> 00:24:38,637
Let's get him on the campaign trail.

362
00:24:35,667 --> 00:24:37,498
(# Thumping hip-hop)

363
00:24:39,727 --> 00:24:44,278
Easy, rude boy. Me name be Ali G
and me is here representing Staines.

364
00:24:44,327 --> 00:24:46,602
Can me count on your vote?

365
00:24:46,647 --> 00:24:48,956
- Definitely not.
- Hairy muff.

366
00:24:49,007 --> 00:24:50,520
Seeing as I is here,

367
00:24:50,567 --> 00:24:54,196
could me interest you in
a quarter of Moroccan black?

368
00:24:54,247 --> 00:24:56,158
It's well good shit!

369
00:24:56,207 --> 00:24:59,517
Dave, it's your turn
to shit through the letterbox.

370
00:24:59,567 --> 00:25:03,037
Our anti-bullying programme
has won lots of praise.

371
00:25:03,087 --> 00:25:07,444
Instances of bullying in
this school are at an all-time low.

372
00:25:07,487 --> 00:25:11,162
Jonathan used to suffer terribly
from bullies.

373
00:25:11,207 --> 00:25:14,085
I ain't surprised. Look at him.

374
00:25:14,627 --> 00:25:20,179
Hey, fatty bum bum. Hey, fatty bum
bum. Want another cream cake?

375
00:25:21,727 --> 00:25:23,922
Boiiing! Boiiing! Boiiing!

376
00:25:23,967 --> 00:25:25,958
(Laughs)

377
00:25:26,507 --> 00:25:28,816
He is well fat, though.

378
00:25:28,867 --> 00:25:33,895
All you motherfuckers,
fuck-fuck-fuck fuckers!

379
00:25:33,947 --> 00:25:37,906
Vote for the G, the motherfuckin' G.
Me, the motherfuckin' G.

380
00:25:38,447 --> 00:25:41,086
All the bitches in the house say yo.

381
00:25:43,747 --> 00:25:48,867
Vote for me
cos me know what you lezzers want.

382
00:25:48,907 --> 00:25:54,300
I is a big supporter of your cause
and I is got many of your videos.

383
00:25:54,347 --> 00:25:59,580
If you vote for me, me give you me
pledge to lower taxes on strap-ons.

384
00:25:59,627 --> 00:26:01,618
(Jeering)

385
00:26:01,667 --> 00:26:04,545
Why is you getting so eggy?
Is you all on?

386
00:26:05,087 --> 00:26:09,365
Ladies and gentlemen, to commemorate
the town hall extension,

387
00:26:09,907 --> 00:26:13,786
we're asking all the candidates
to lay down a brick.

388
00:26:13,827 --> 00:26:16,057
Ali, would you lay one for us now?

389
00:26:16,607 --> 00:26:19,041
- What, here?
- We would be honoured.

390
00:26:19,087 --> 00:26:21,203
- In front of everyone?
- Yes.

391
00:26:31,987 --> 00:26:34,581
(Groans of disgust)

392
00:26:36,567 --> 00:26:38,319
Not bad.

393
00:26:37,867 --> 00:26:40,222
This is absolutely vital.

394
00:26:40,267 --> 00:26:42,417
10 days ago we were 14 points ahead,

395
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:45,220
with one day to go
we are eight points behind.

396
00:26:45,267 --> 00:26:48,862
Listen. Did you get the manifesto
that I sent to you?

397
00:26:50,707 --> 00:26:53,779
- You got a roach?
- Er... For real.

398
00:26:53,827 --> 00:26:56,387
(# Reggae)

399
00:27:00,607 --> 00:27:04,156
- You got another roach?
- Yeah, for real.

400
00:27:04,707 --> 00:27:08,143
(Ali) Yeah.
(Ricky) Wicked.

401
00:27:09,187 --> 00:27:11,747
Yes. It was very helpful.

402
00:27:12,287 --> 00:27:15,518
30 seconds till we're on air.
Come with me.

403
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:19,116
Good luck. Don't hold back.

404
00:27:18,167 --> 00:27:20,203
(# News theme)

405
00:27:23,807 --> 00:27:28,437
In the most crucial by-election
of the past decade,

406
00:27:28,487 --> 00:27:32,605
we're joined by ex-Environment
Secretary David Griffiths

407
00:27:32,647 --> 00:27:34,638
and newcomer Ali G.

408
00:27:34,687 --> 00:27:37,645
This debate will help you
make up your mind.

409
00:27:38,187 --> 00:27:42,385
Ali, if elected,
what would you do for Staines?

410
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:45,487
Me'd save
the John Nike Leisure Centre.

411
00:27:45,527 --> 00:27:47,995
You can't mean your sole policy

412
00:27:48,047 --> 00:27:53,075
is to save a centre that's barely
used and a terrible drain on funds?

413
00:27:53,127 --> 00:27:55,641
What are your other policies?

414
00:27:55,687 --> 00:27:59,885
- My other policies?
- Yes, you must have some.

415
00:28:02,647 --> 00:28:04,717
Well...

416
00:28:06,307 --> 00:28:11,427
I think it is well important
to reduce inflay-tee-on

417
00:28:11,467 --> 00:28:16,666
and also to invest in the nehuss.

418
00:28:18,847 --> 00:28:20,997
(Ali) The nahuss.

419
00:28:21,047 --> 00:28:23,845
- Oh, the NHS.
- You're reading from my sheet.

420
00:28:23,887 --> 00:28:27,846
No, I ain't. I is thought of them
things meself, you copied from me.

421
00:28:28,387 --> 00:28:30,298
It wasn't me.

422
00:28:30,847 --> 00:28:34,283
Then perhaps you'd tell me
where you stand on the ERM?

423
00:28:34,327 --> 00:28:37,876
No problem. Me thought
their first album was wack.

424
00:28:37,927 --> 00:28:39,758
Me hate all indie music.

425
00:28:39,807 --> 00:28:43,925
The voters deserve better, you're
making a mockery of this debate.

426
00:28:44,967 --> 00:28:47,481
What? Is you looking in the mirror?

427
00:28:47,527 --> 00:28:52,123
You're making it obvious
to the voters what a buffoon you are.

428
00:28:52,167 --> 00:28:55,637
Talking about yourself again?
I think so.

429
00:28:55,687 --> 00:28:59,043
You are an embarrassment
to the people of Staines.

430
00:28:59,587 --> 00:29:02,385
That is not a nice way
to talk about your mum.

431
00:29:02,927 --> 00:29:07,921
I put it to you that you are
the worst possible candidate

432
00:29:07,967 --> 00:29:10,720
ever put forward
by your miserable party.

433
00:29:10,767 --> 00:29:13,281
Well, I put it to you...

434
00:29:22,607 --> 00:29:24,962
that you sucked off a horse.

435
00:29:25,007 --> 00:29:26,599
(Gasping)

436
00:29:28,087 --> 00:29:30,965
I did not, er...suck off a horse.

437
00:29:32,727 --> 00:29:36,402
I have already dealt with this issue
with the party chairman

438
00:29:36,447 --> 00:29:38,563
and as I explained to him,

439
00:29:39,107 --> 00:29:42,816
I was out hunting with a friend

440
00:29:43,367 --> 00:29:47,997
and I slipped onto
the end of a horse's phallus,

441
00:29:48,547 --> 00:29:54,019
which, unfortunately,
owing to it being the mating season,

442
00:29:54,067 --> 00:29:56,661
was aroused.

(Ali) 'That's the handbrake.'

465
00:31:29,987 --> 00:31:32,626
(Julie) 'Now, let's get jiggy.'

466
00:31:32,667 --> 00:31:36,057
(Ali singing)
# Mr Boombastic, reggae fantastic!

467
00:31:36,107 --> 00:31:38,223
# Take it as a dooby-dooby-doogy

468
00:31:38,267 --> 00:31:40,144
# Mr Ro-Ro-Ro-Ro-Ro...

469
00:31:40,187 --> 00:31:43,304
# Mmmmmmantic! #

470
00:31:43,347 --> 00:31:45,383
(Whimpers)

471
00:31:47,667 --> 00:31:48,861
Is it in yet?

472
00:32:03,147 --> 00:32:06,423
Big up yourself. Respect.

473
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:09,197
- Big up yourself.
- MP for Staines.

474
00:32:09,747 --> 00:32:13,706
I know you. You was the geezer
that did it with that prossie.

475
00:32:16,027 --> 00:32:17,619
Respect.

476
00:32:20,747 --> 00:32:23,784
- Because this government...
- Order! Order!

477
00:32:25,227 --> 00:32:29,379
This government's conduct
of economic policy

478
00:32:29,427 --> 00:32:32,146
has not only been incompetent,

479
00:32:32,187 --> 00:32:37,739
it has been unscrupulous,
untrustworthy and untruthful.

480
00:32:37,787 --> 00:32:41,575
They is dissin' our posse.
I is gonna sort this.

481
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:45,881
- (Speaker) Order. Order now.
- And look at this!

482
00:32:45,927 --> 00:32:51,081
Order! Order! Will the Member
for Staines return to his seat?

483
00:32:51,627 --> 00:32:55,666
Will the Member for Staines
return to his seat?!

484
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:59,541
Order! Order in the House!

485
00:33:03,887 --> 00:33:07,846
- What is he doing?
- I'm not sure, Prime Minister.

486
00:33:07,887 --> 00:33:10,355
(All shouting)

487
00:33:10,407 --> 00:33:13,956
- For you to come down to me...
- Shhh.

488
00:33:14,507 --> 00:33:18,102
Relax ya batty.

489
00:33:24,067 --> 00:33:26,262
Look at you!

490
00:33:26,307 --> 00:33:29,583
All you ever do all day long
is cuss each other.

491
00:33:29,627 --> 00:33:33,586
R-E-S-T-E-C-P.

492
00:33:35,127 --> 00:33:39,598
- Do you even know what that spells?
- Restecp?

493
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:46,162
- Yes. Restecp.
- Restecp.

494
00:33:46,707 --> 00:33:50,939
How's anyone out there
meant to restecp each other

495
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:57,142
if you lot in here don't even start
restecp-ing one another?

496
00:33:57,187 --> 00:33:58,905
Sergeant, eject him.

497
00:33:59,447 --> 00:34:03,326
Wanna know how to make this country
better? It's simple. Two words.

498
00:34:03,867 --> 00:34:06,859
- Keep it real.
- That's three words.

499
00:34:06,907 --> 00:34:10,866
Don't be a spanner. "lt" ain't
a real word. It's short for "innit".

500
00:34:10,907 --> 00:34:15,503
- Keep it real!
- He is banned from the House.

501
00:34:16,047 --> 00:34:18,038
Is it cos I is black?

502
00:34:18,587 --> 00:34:21,579
What in God's name
have you done to me?

503
00:34:21,627 --> 00:34:24,937
I want that idiot in my office
with his resignation.

504
00:34:24,987 --> 00:34:26,466
Yes, Prime Minister.

505
00:34:26,507 --> 00:34:29,305
- (Knock on door)
- Come in.

506
00:34:31,707 --> 00:34:35,416
- Listen, me know me done wrong.
- Haven't you read the papers?

507
00:34:46,967 --> 00:34:48,400
I can't believe it.

508
00:34:50,667 --> 00:34:52,737
This dog can play table tennis.

509
00:34:52,787 --> 00:34:56,746
- It's the press, they love you.
- But how can he hold the bat?

510
00:34:56,787 --> 00:35:00,336
The Deputy Prime Minister and I
were wondering,

511
00:35:00,887 --> 00:35:03,799
what if I asked you
to join the Cabinet?

512
00:35:03,847 --> 00:35:05,883
No, think about it.

513
00:35:06,427 --> 00:35:10,386
Ali joins the Cabinet,
the two of them are publicly aligned.

514
00:35:10,427 --> 00:35:13,260
Ali slips up,
he takes that old prat with him.

515
00:35:13,307 --> 00:35:14,899
Why would Ali join?

516
00:35:14,947 --> 00:35:19,418
I've told the Prime Minister
to offer to save his leisure centre.

517
00:35:19,467 --> 00:35:22,425
- Are you mad? That would...
- Let me finish.

518
00:35:22,467 --> 00:35:28,542
Offers to save his leisure centre
if Ali gets him a 20-point poll lead.

519
00:35:29,087 --> 00:35:34,081
Now I is in the Cabinet and all,
could I see the red button?

520
00:35:34,627 --> 00:35:36,822
- Can I trust you?
- Yes.

521
00:35:36,867 --> 00:35:38,983
All right. Here we are.

522
00:35:39,527 --> 00:35:45,238
One touch on that red button
could destroy the whole world.

523
00:35:45,787 --> 00:35:49,143
- That is very interesting because...
- No!

524
00:35:49,187 --> 00:35:50,984
Fell for it!

525
00:35:51,027 --> 00:35:54,337
Ali, please, stand away. Dear me.

526
00:35:54,387 --> 00:35:56,821
- Can't we blow up something?
- No!

527
00:35:56,867 --> 00:35:58,266
- Please?
- No.

528
00:35:58,307 --> 00:36:01,265
- Somewhere shitty like Wales.
- Ali.

529
00:36:01,307 --> 00:36:03,502
Their Prime Minister
called your mum a slag.

530
00:36:03,547 --> 00:36:05,458
I am the Prime Minister of Wales!

531
00:36:05,507 --> 00:36:08,021
You shouldn't say that
about your mum.

532
00:36:08,067 --> 00:36:12,504
Your first Cabinet meeting is
Thursday. It's about asylum seekers.

533
00:36:13,507 --> 00:36:17,705
(Prime Minister) I'm sending you
on a fact-finding mission.

534
00:36:17,747 --> 00:36:22,616
Anyone trying to smuggle
will probably come through here.

535
00:36:23,167 --> 00:36:26,204
And it's not just immigrants.
Look at this.

536
00:36:28,627 --> 00:36:32,939
You'll be appalled.
Look at this crap.

537
00:36:32,987 --> 00:36:37,617
Marijuana smuggled in from Europe,
South America and the Middle East.

538
00:36:38,167 --> 00:36:40,886
That is terrible. (Tuts)

539
00:36:42,467 --> 00:36:44,503
- Is there any skunk?
- Yes.

540
00:36:44,547 --> 00:36:47,664
Some scumbag
smuggled in 15 kilos of this.

541
00:36:47,707 --> 00:36:51,017
It's the strongest
super skunk ever discovered.

542
00:36:53,527 --> 00:36:57,679
Over here are the confiscated
weapons and this is where we keep...

543
00:36:57,727 --> 00:37:00,287
(Shouting aggressively)

544
00:37:03,327 --> 00:37:05,636
You must have such a laugh here.

545
00:37:07,147 --> 00:37:09,741
- No, we don't.
- Oh.

546
00:37:09,787 --> 00:37:14,019
Next we have the mountains
of hardcore pornography,

547
00:37:14,067 --> 00:37:17,457
most of it from Germany.
You may want to look away.

548
00:37:17,507 --> 00:37:20,783
No. I is got a job to do.

549
00:37:22,327 --> 00:37:24,966
(Whimpers)

550
00:37:25,007 --> 00:37:28,079
I know. It makes me feel sick, too.

551
00:37:29,627 --> 00:37:33,381
I have to compile me report now,
so if you'd fuck off.

552
00:37:33,427 --> 00:37:35,543
Certainly, sir.

553
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:39,899
Westminster will be sending down
experts to help with me research.

554
00:37:39,947 --> 00:37:42,905
(Whispering and laughing)

555
00:37:42,947 --> 00:37:45,256
Hello. We is experts.

556
00:37:47,907 --> 00:37:51,377
(Cheesy music, people moaning)

557
00:37:54,727 --> 00:37:56,957
'Sprütze in die Arse!'

558
00:38:00,067 --> 00:38:04,219
Ali, tell us,
what did you find out in Dover?

559
00:38:04,267 --> 00:38:07,384
Me saw a lot of stuff,
most of it from Germany,

560
00:38:07,927 --> 00:38:11,442
of these blokes going in
through the back door.

561
00:38:11,987 --> 00:38:15,377
He's right.
In Germany, I experienced it myself.

562
00:38:15,427 --> 00:38:18,464
- Respect.
- I remember one time

563
00:38:18,507 --> 00:38:21,305
there were these
two huge African men

564
00:38:21,347 --> 00:38:25,659
who managed to squeeze themselves
into...this tiny box.

565
00:38:26,947 --> 00:38:30,064
- How long was they in there for?
- 15 hours.

566
00:38:30,107 --> 00:38:33,258
- It was incredibly emotional.
- It must've hurt.

567
00:38:33,307 --> 00:38:36,344
- It still does.
- Sorry.

568
00:38:37,547 --> 00:38:41,256
So, John, what are we going to do
about these asylum seekers?

569
00:38:41,807 --> 00:38:45,641
We can't let them all in,
it would cripple the economy.

570
00:38:45,687 --> 00:38:47,086
Oooh!

571
00:38:47,627 --> 00:38:50,539
- Yes, Ali?
- Let's think about this.

572
00:38:50,587 --> 00:38:53,704
What's the main thing
we ain't got enough of in the UK?

573
00:38:53,747 --> 00:38:55,146
- Hospitals.
- No.

574
00:38:55,187 --> 00:38:58,145
- Libraries?
- Behave!

575
00:38:58,187 --> 00:39:00,576
We ain't got enough fit women.

576
00:39:00,627 --> 00:39:03,346
And we's got too many mingers.

577
00:39:03,387 --> 00:39:05,662
No offence, Karen.

578
00:39:05,707 --> 00:39:10,178
So we let in all the fit refugees
and turn away the rank ones.

579
00:39:10,227 --> 00:39:12,183
Then we solve both problems.

580
00:39:12,227 --> 00:39:16,379
We is knobbing two birds
with one connie.

581
00:39:16,427 --> 00:39:19,942
- This is ludicrous.
- What do you think?

582
00:39:19,987 --> 00:39:23,184
I think...we should keep it real.

583
00:39:24,467 --> 00:39:25,946
Fit.

584
00:39:25,987 --> 00:39:28,421
Fit...fit.

585
00:39:29,587 --> 00:39:31,464
Wait.

586
00:39:32,007 --> 00:39:33,998
Back to Slovenia.

587
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:42,324
Education standards
are at their lowest for 15 years.

588
00:39:42,367 --> 00:39:46,838
That is because kids is learning
stuff that ain't no use to them.

589
00:39:46,887 --> 00:39:51,597
Who here has ever used maths?
Or English?

590
00:39:52,967 --> 00:39:57,757
Exactly. Let's start
making education relevant.

591
00:39:58,307 --> 00:40:03,700
If Kevin buys six ounces
of Jamaican sinsemilla from Fat Tony

592
00:40:04,247 --> 00:40:06,920
for £480 cash in hand,

593
00:40:07,467 --> 00:40:10,664
and has to divide it
amongst 11 of his customers,

594
00:40:10,707 --> 00:40:13,175
how much should he charge
for an eighth

595
00:40:13,227 --> 00:40:16,742
so he can make £100 profit
to pay off his child support?

596
00:40:16,787 --> 00:40:22,066
The situation in Northern Ireland
is spiralling out of control.

597
00:40:22,107 --> 00:40:23,540
Hear me now.

598
00:40:24,087 --> 00:40:27,966
The only way you is ever gonna get
Hindus to stop killing Islams...

599
00:40:28,507 --> 00:40:32,420
- Catholics fighting Protestants.
- Whatever.

600
00:40:32,967 --> 00:40:38,121
...is to get some really fit woman
to get her babylons out for peace.

601
00:40:38,167 --> 00:40:40,522
- Prime Minister...
- Not you, love.

602
00:40:40,567 --> 00:40:46,085
The army is costing the British
taxpayer £4.2 billion a year.

603
00:40:46,127 --> 00:40:49,278
How will the government
reduce this figure?

604
00:40:49,327 --> 00:40:52,763
We is gonna hire the A-Team.

605
00:40:52,807 --> 00:40:55,367
Her Majesty the Queen.

606
00:40:57,447 --> 00:41:01,281
Your Majesty, may I introduce
Ali G, MP for Staines?

607
00:41:19,787 --> 00:41:25,225
Hello, cheeky. You is much fitter
than you look on them coins.

608
00:41:25,267 --> 00:41:28,782
Next time me put a 50p piece
in me pocket

609
00:41:28,827 --> 00:41:33,025
me will feel honoured having
your head so close to me nuts.

610
00:41:33,067 --> 00:41:37,185
Nothing's working, the jobless
figures are at their highest level.

611
00:41:39,987 --> 00:41:44,697
The UK has a special relationship
with the US. Do you like Bush?

612
00:41:45,247 --> 00:41:51,595
Me love bush. Me love anything that
gives foliage to the punani area.

613
00:41:53,007 --> 00:41:55,396
Would you do a dance for me, please?

614
00:42:01,907 --> 00:42:05,582
- Oh, my God.
- Shaven haven. Respect.

615
00:42:05,627 --> 00:42:10,417
- 'As Ali G's influence grows...'
- '...a 12-point lead.'

616
00:42:10,467 --> 00:42:12,822

Is you a genuine mong?

Hello?

What you doing up here? Why not
stay downstairs with that posh girl?

671

- We was talking about politics.
- I ain't interested, just shut up!

You really are a prat.
Now, come here.

We can't. This is the PM's bedroom.

Well...

676
00:46:59,927 --> 00:47:03,283
Why don't you pretend to be
the Prime Minister?

677
00:47:04,527 --> 00:47:06,438
Cheeky.

Ladies and gentlemen, please.
In advance of tomorrow's summit,

680
00:47:16,507 --> 00:47:19,783
I shall be having private talks
with both parties.

681
00:47:19,827 --> 00:47:24,264
First, President Mwepu,
would you care to join me upstairs?

682
00:47:24,307 --> 00:47:27,743
- A pleasure.
- Thank you.

(Crash, then silence)

688
00:48:02,527 --> 00:48:05,121
I must say, I enjoyed that.

689
00:48:05,667 --> 00:48:08,818
(Prime Minister) So did I.
I'm so glad we thrashed it out.

690
00:48:08,867 --> 00:48:12,064
Ladies and gentlemen,
I want everyone here to know

691
00:48:12,107 --> 00:48:16,066
that President Mwepu here
is a very big man.

692
00:48:16,607 --> 00:48:21,635
And I would like you to know that
the Prime Minister was very hard

693
00:48:21,687 --> 00:48:24,155
- but very straight.
- (All gasping)

694
00:48:24,207 --> 00:48:27,165
The President was very much on top
to start off with

695
00:48:27,707 --> 00:48:31,336
but I don't mind telling you,
I was in a deep hole.

696
00:48:31,387 --> 00:48:34,504
- Oh, very deep.
- (Gasping)

697
00:48:35,047 --> 00:48:38,164
We had some sticky patches
but I'm delighted to say

698
00:48:38,207 --> 00:48:42,166
- we came together in the end.
- (Gasping)

699
00:48:42,207 --> 00:48:46,200
Yes, I lapped up everything
that you had to offer.

700
00:48:46,247 --> 00:48:49,876
Now President Oompeba,
would you care to join me upstairs?

701
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:52,646
No bloody way.

702
00:48:52,687 --> 00:48:54,086
Can I come?

703
00:49:04,527 --> 00:49:07,166
Come on, honey, let's go home.

704
00:49:07,207 --> 00:49:10,165
- I'll cook you up your favourite.
- Angel Delight?

705
00:49:10,207 --> 00:49:13,085
Yeah, butterscotch.

706
00:49:13,127 --> 00:49:16,756
(Both) Mmmm. Butterscotch.

707
00:49:16,807 --> 00:49:19,116
This bit is for the girls,

708
00:49:19,167 --> 00:49:22,842
to show that me can be
well sensitive.

709
00:49:23,387 --> 00:49:27,380
By the way, if any of you bitches
is fit and into doggy,

710
00:49:27,427 --> 00:49:30,225
here is me mobile number.

711
00:49:30,767 --> 00:49:34,157
Callers must be over 16.

712
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:36,277
But not by too much.

713
00:49:39,787 --> 00:49:44,463
Me can't. They need me at
the peace conference tomorrow.

714
00:49:44,507 --> 00:49:48,898
You what? What about the people
who really need you?

715
00:49:49,447 --> 00:49:52,325
What about Ricky?
What about Dave?

716
00:49:52,367 --> 00:49:54,358
What about me, Ali?

717
00:49:56,887 --> 00:49:59,082
Please come back to Staines.

718
00:50:00,727 --> 00:50:06,802
The world is bigger than Staines.
And me gotta save it.

719
00:50:09,607 --> 00:50:12,326
You'll have to do it
on your own, then.

720
00:50:12,867 --> 00:50:15,222
Me Julie. Me Julie?

721
00:50:17,647 --> 00:50:19,683
Let me call you back.

722
00:50:20,887 --> 00:50:24,482
We've gotta get rid of him
before the centre's saved.

723
00:50:24,527 --> 00:50:26,995
- What I thought...
- You thought?!

724
00:50:27,987 --> 00:50:30,217
The US will do everything
in its power

725
00:50:30,267 --> 00:50:34,021
to support Chad in its struggle
against its neighbours.

726
00:50:34,567 --> 00:50:39,004
Russia will not allow this
Western oppression to continue

727
00:50:39,047 --> 00:50:42,198
and in order to support
Burkina Faso,

728
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:47,480
is prepared to utilise
all our military capabilities.

729
00:50:48,027 --> 00:50:52,578
- That's outrageous!
- How can you make such a statement?

730
00:50:52,627 --> 00:50:55,744
- Ali, Ali, Ali.
- (Jungle beats from headphones)

731
00:50:56,287 --> 00:51:00,200
- Armageddon's breaking out, help.
- Sure, bro.

732
00:51:00,247 --> 00:51:02,807
The United States
will not be intimidated.

733
00:51:02,847 --> 00:51:06,362
We will meet any show of force
with our full military might!

734
00:51:06,407 --> 00:51:09,046
(Angry shouting)

735
00:51:24,187 --> 00:51:25,620
Oi!

736
00:51:25,667 --> 00:51:29,979
You know why they is shouting?
They ain't been fed their teas.

737
00:51:30,027 --> 00:51:31,540
Come on, choppy chop.

738
00:51:32,087 --> 00:51:34,840
(Shouting continues)

739
00:51:43,007 --> 00:51:44,998
Moving to a motion,

740
00:51:45,547 --> 00:51:48,857
all those in favour of sending Iran
to the gas station

741
00:51:48,907 --> 00:51:52,866
to get some potato chips
and chocolate, raise your hand.

742
00:51:52,907 --> 00:51:54,784
For real.

743
00:51:55,327 --> 00:51:57,477
(Giggling)

744
00:51:57,527 --> 00:51:59,085
Oh, bummer.

745
00:51:59,127 --> 00:52:02,199
# Tease me, tease me, tease me,
tease me, baby... #

746
00:52:02,247 --> 00:52:07,367
I'm sorry we invaded you.
It was really uncool.

747
00:52:07,907 --> 00:52:11,104
Who cares? It's all in the past.

748
00:52:11,147 --> 00:52:14,344
If I was going to be invaded
by anyone,

749
00:52:14,387 --> 00:52:16,378
I am happy it was you.

750
00:52:16,427 --> 00:52:21,501
You are really cool.
You have nice clothes.

751
00:52:22,547 --> 00:52:27,496
- You saved my white ass, Ali.
- No problem, bredrin.

752
00:52:27,547 --> 00:52:30,698
Big up the herbal tea, aight?

753
00:52:30,747 --> 00:52:32,419
Hey, you, Britain!

754
00:52:36,007 --> 00:52:38,237
Respect.

755
00:52:38,287 --> 00:52:40,517
How does he do it?

756
00:52:40,567 --> 00:52:42,842
# ...catchin' a big fish

757
00:52:42,887 --> 00:52:45,765
# Yes, you are on top
of my romance list

758
00:52:45,807 --> 00:52:49,117
# Second to none,
you defeat the favourite

759
00:52:49,167 --> 00:52:52,682
# Woman, your love
is like burnin' fire in my soul

760
00:52:52,727 --> 00:52:55,878
# Woman, tease me
till me lose control

761
00:52:55,927 --> 00:53:00,079
# Woman, your love is like
burnin' fire in me soul

762
00:53:00,127 --> 00:53:03,119
# Woman, tease me
till me lose control

763
00:53:03,167 --> 00:53:06,955
# Tease me, tease me, tease me,
tease me, baby #

764
00:53:08,707 --> 00:53:14,304
We're quite a team, Ali.
Thanks to you we're 22 points ahead.

765
00:53:14,847 --> 00:53:19,363
- I'm gonna save your centre.
- Wicked! Bo! Bo! Bo!

766
00:53:19,407 --> 00:53:24,765
(Ali) Check out all the Peperami!
(PM) For you - this is your moment.

767
00:53:25,307 --> 00:53:27,867
(Shouting)

768
00:53:32,647 --> 00:53:37,357
Will you comment on accusations
that you drugged the world leaders?

769
00:53:39,087 --> 00:53:42,397
- You what?
- Our evidence proves you're guilty.

770
00:53:42,947 --> 00:53:44,824
Er...

771
00:53:44,867 --> 00:53:47,335
"Our evidence proves you're guilty."

772

And this tape proves it.

- No, David.

1065

it was to create a better world,

integrity and truth.

that vision was lost.
