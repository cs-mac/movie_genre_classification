1
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:05,210
- Don't do that.
- Why not'?

2
00:00:05,305 --> 00:00:07,376
- Because.
- Because why'?

3
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:10,148
- Because I don't want you to touch me there.
- Why not'?

4
00:00:10,243 --> 00:00:11,722
Because I said so.

5
00:00:11,811 --> 00:00:14,621
Just let me put my hand there.
I Won't even move it.

6
00:00:14,714 --> 00:00:16,557
- Promise?
- I swear to God.

7
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:20,495
- All right then.
- All right then.

8
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:22,965
I thought you said you
weren't gonna do that.

9
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:24,399
I thought you promised.

10
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:25,868
So I lied.

11
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,497
- Don't do that.
- Why not'?

12
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:31,007
- Because.
- Because what?

13
00:00:31,097 --> 00:00:33,976
Because I don't want you to. I told you.

14
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:36,843
What is wrong with my just keeping
my hand there and not moving it'?

15
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:39,849
But you don't just keep
your hand there without moving it.

16
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:41,919
- I will this time.
- I don't believe you.

17
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:44,010
- I promise.
- You promised last time.

18
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,317
I had my fingers crossed.

19
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:51,557
For the last time, don't do that.

20
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:54,029
- Don't do what?
- You know damn well What.

21
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,600
No, I don't.
I am doing nothing.

22
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:59,533
Well, then stop doing nothing.

23
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,234
Boy, your sister Joyce
sure is sexy.

24
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,311
Yeah, but she looked even better
before she bleached her hair.

25
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:15,879
I still think she's sexy.

26
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,812
I still say she's a creep.

27
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:20,681
Whoa!

28
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:47,645
Would you mind doing
that someplace else'?

29
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:55,117
It's my house, you know?
It's my party.

30
00:02:57,977 --> 00:03:01,049
Boy, that Miss Phipps sure takes
her chaperone real seriously.

31
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:04,185
She's a bigger drag at parties
than she even is at school.

32
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:07,527
- But she's still the sexiest teacher at school.
- Yeah, and the most uptight.

33
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,998
At least they're not enjoying it.

34
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:21,905
- Get on the ground.
- What's going on here'?

35
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:23,912
Just keep quiet.

36
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:30,879
What are you looking at'?

37
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:32,752
Oh!

38
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:36,224
Joyce, she's taking off
all her clothes.

39
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:38,262
Come on. Let me see.

40
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:51,369
Whoa!

41
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,376
Oh, WOW!

42
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:58,506
Look at this!

43
00:03:58,605 --> 00:03:59,709
- Uh-oh! Philly!
- What?

44
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:01,513
- What?
- Yipes!

45
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:06,248
Oh, hi, Miss Phipps.

46
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:08,826
- Philly, what are you doing'?
- Exercise.

47
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,952
One...

48
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,461
and two...

49
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,967
- Are you all right'?
- Yeah.

50
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:23,070
Philly...

51
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:25,267
were you peeking
at a girl in the bathroom?

52
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:27,140
No, I was exercising.

53
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:31,147
I know it's normal for
a boy your age to be curious

54
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:33,148
- about the other sex.
- Yes, ma'am.

55
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:38,313
Philly, the thing is to find girls Whose age
is more appropriate for you.

56
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:40,322
Yes, ma'am.

57
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:45,825
Let's go back to the party and
find someone for you to dance with.

58
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:59,843
And we were supposed to go
on a fishing trip to Canada this week.

59
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:03,812
- How come you didn't'?
- My dad has a dumb business trip to take first.

60
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:05,849
Now I have to wait
three lousy weeks.

61
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:08,544
- You wouldn't have had much fun anyway.
- Aw, sure I would.

62
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,018
Philly!

63
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:12,180
- Yeah?
- What about lunch?

64
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:15,521
- I'm gonna eat at the airport with my dad.
- All right.

65
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:18,323
At what time would you like
to have your dinner then?

66
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:22,927
- About 7:00 I guess.
- Won't that be too late?

67
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:25,935
- No.
- All right then.

68
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:29,006
Whatever you say, sir.

69
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:34,339
- That's your new housekeeper, Miss Mallow?
- Yeah.

70
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:36,209
How old do you think she is'?

71
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:40,114
I don't know. 25 or 30.
Old, but not as old as the rest We've had.

72
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:42,345
- Think she puts out'?
- I dunno. Maybe.

73
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:45,252
- Morning, Philly.
- Oh, morning, Mr. Green.

74
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,815
- Think she'll do it for the gardener'?
- I dunno. Maybe.

75
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:50,724
Think she'll do it
for the chauffer'?

76
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:53,297
Lester the frou'?
Nobody would do it for him.

77
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:57,061
- I think I'd better Walk you to the gate.
- Yeah, I think you'd better.

78
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:00,399
Think she'd do it for you'?

79
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:01,904
- For me'?
- Yeah.

80
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:04,338
Definitely. Well, maybe.

81
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,376
Well, if you strike outwith her,

82
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:08,946
just remember to send her
over to me, okay?

83
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:12,073
What are you, crazy?
You wouldn't even get up to bat.

84
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:14,151
Yeah, that's what you think.

85
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:18,913
Green, please stay away
from the car. I just Washed it.

86
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:21,389
Sure.

87
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:24,189
Do you see what
you've done here'?

88
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:25,694
Yeah.

89
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:28,595
- Is that all that you have to say to me'?
- No.

90
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:31,225
You got a pile of shit
on that car.

91
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:33,770
Mm-hmm.
I'll tell you some--

92
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:00,588
Hi, Joyce.

93
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:02,927
Oh. Hi, Philly.

94
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:10,469
Can't you children find
someplace else to play'?

95
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:13,066
Go find someplace else yourself.
We were here first.

96
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:23,444
Boy, what a creep she is.

97
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:25,979
Thank you.

98
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:29,616
I should have gone to camp this summer
just to get away from her.

99
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:32,525
- How come you didn't'?
- How come'?

100
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,928
'Cause I gotta go on
this goddamn cruise

101
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:37,228
with my parents
and my creepy sister

102
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:39,394
to goddamn Honolulu.

103
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:42,063
We're gonna learn
the goddamn hula-hula.

104
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:43,572
Pretty good.

105
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:46,041
Sherman, would you boys
like something to eat'?

106
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,543
No.

107
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,442
Thank you.

108
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:56,849
- Guess how old she is.
- How old'?

109
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:59,150
110!

110
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:00,986
I Wonder what she looks like.

111
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,185
What do you mean
"what she looks like"?

112
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:05,193
I mean under her uniform.

113
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:07,264
My housekeeper'?

114
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:09,333
No, my housekeeper.
Miss Mallow.

115
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:11,629
You're sick.

116
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:14,728
You take care of everything
while I'm away, Philly.

117
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,103
You're the man of
the house now, you know.

118
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:18,607
Right.

119
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:20,439
Philly, I wish
your mother were alive

120
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:23,241
so she oould see how well
you can handle yourself now.

121
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:27,148
Well, anyway, you listen to Lester and
show the new housekeeper the ropes.

122
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,810
You think you can handle her'?

123
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:30,319
- Right.
- Good.

124
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:35,623
Lester, for God sakes,
don't treat my luggage like that.

125
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:37,422
I'm very sorry, Mr. Fillmore.

126
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,088
There are some important things
in there. Are you aware of that'?

127
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:44,191
Yes, I am relentlessly
aware of that, sir.

128
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:47,533
Thank you, Lester. Well--

129
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:52,098
So, I guess there's nothing else.

130
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,269
We'll just say good-bye.

131
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:59,408
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

132
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:03,283
Have a good trip, Dad.

133
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,356
Thanks.

134
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:16,088
What are we stopping here for'?

135
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:18,025
I mean, isn't this
the servant's entrance?

136
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,221
Yes.

137
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:25,431
Don't you usually drop me off
in front of the house?

138
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:27,231
Usually.

139
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:28,771
<i>So'?</i>

140
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:32,536
So, this time I didn't.

141
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:39,579
Will you be getting out
here then, Philly?

142
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,283
Thank you, Philly.

143
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,508
Philly?

144
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:22,347
Do you mind if we talk'?

145
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:23,943
What about?

146
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:25,818
Things in general.

147
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,289
Like what?

148
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,382
I don't know.
Whatever you like.

149
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:33,089
Like what do you do
with your time?

150
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:36,189
Not too much, I guess.

151
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:39,895
What is there for me to do in this area
on my nights off'?

152
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:43,166
I don't know.
There's a movie theater downtown,

153
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:46,675
a drugstore and a couple
of bars, I guess.

154
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,439
Not too much really.

155
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:51,344
What did the other girls do
on their nights off'?

156
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,144
I mean the other housekeepers.

157
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:56,516
The other housekeepers
aren't exactly what you'd call girls.

158
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,452
They were mostly elderly women.

159
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:00,922
Their nights off,
they mostly went to sleep.

160
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:04,119
You mean your previous housekeepers
have been elderly Women mostly?

161
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:05,820
Mm-hmm.

162
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:08,091
That must not have been
too interesting for you.

163
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:09,791
What do you mean'?

164
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:14,099
I mean it must not have been too interesting
for a young man of 15, is it'?

165
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:18,733
Going on 16. I'm not sure
I got your point. What do you mean'?

166
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:20,640
It must not have been
so interesting

167
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:23,145
to sit across from
your elderly housekeepers

168
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:26,876
and look up their dresses
like you're looking up mine right now.

169
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:29,179
Why do you say things like that?

170
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:30,845
Well, Why shouldn't I'?

171
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:32,945
Because they embarrass me,
that's why.

172
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:34,683
Philly, I was only teasing you.

173
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,316
Did you have a good time?

174
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:38,486
- Oh, yeah.
- Very good.

175
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:41,121
Hey, I did not want
to embarrass you. Really.

176
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,030
- All right.
- Will you forgive me'?

177
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:46,160
I don't know.

178
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:03,815
I planned to do some shopping this afternoon.
Can you drop me at the store'?

179
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:05,752
Well, Miss Mallow, I suppose.

180
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:09,554
I do have an appointment at 10:00.
I can't be late, but sure.

181
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:11,059
I'd really appreciate that.

182
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:14,563
But can I change out of my uniform first?
Is that all right'?

183
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:17,190
It's fine. Just don't
be all day about it.

184
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:18,893
Thank you.

185
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:49,566
Thank you for Waiting, Lester.

186
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,574
Well, Nicole, how is everything going'?

187
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:14,082
Just fine, Lester.

188
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:16,653
You seem to be getting along
with Philly very well.

189
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:18,915
So when are you gonna
get it on with him'?

190
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:21,355
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

191
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:23,950
Now listen, sweet pants,
Mr. Fillmore's trip is a short one

192
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:28,020
and this whole thing has to be over
and done with by the time he gets back.

193
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,067
But, Lester,
he's just a 15-year-old boy.

194
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,193
15 is the perfect age.

195
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:34,828
Just think,

196
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:36,838
you're giving him private lessons--

197
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:39,170
an advanced education.

198
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:40,971
I just feel bad about it.

199
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:43,637
If you don't do it,
you're gonna feel a lot Worse.

200
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:45,807
Is this a threat, Lester?

201
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:48,851
That is exactly what it is.

202
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:04,226
Philly, don't leave it there.

203
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:05,427
What?

204
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,435
I said don't leave
your bike there.

205
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,971
Why not?

206
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:11,166
It's not safe.

207
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:13,869
- Why not'?
- It might get run over,

208
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:16,173
disfigured, mangled
beyond recognition.

209
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:17,645
By Who?

210
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:20,216
Careless motorists.

211
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:22,148
Well, there aren't
any motorists in this driveway...

212
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:23,720
except you.

213
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,962
Go!

214
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:41,236
I'm up.

215
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:43,067
- Take the stuff.
- Okay.

216
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:45,039
Got it'? I'm coming up.

217
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:48,912
Okay.

218
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:52,214
- Ow!
<i>'</i> You okay'?

219
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:54,147
- Yeah.
- Give me the camera.

220
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,809
Okay.

221
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,514
Keep quiet.
Now, on three.

222
00:17:58,610 --> 00:17:59,680
- Okay.
- Okay.

223
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:02,349
One. . .two. . .three.
Go!

224
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:06,962
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

225
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:09,589
- Okay.
- My stomach helped me.

226
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:15,604
Here she comes.

227
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:17,571
- Okay.
- Oh, yes.

228
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:20,439
- She's unbuttoning her uniform!
- This'll be great!

229
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:22,239
- Oh, yes!
- She's doin' it!

230
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:27,181
- Oh, yes!
- This is gonna be terrific. Clean underwear.

231
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,273
There she goes.

232
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:30,250
Go!

233
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:34,353
Oh, this is gonna be terrific.

234
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:37,584
Hit the deck!

235
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,029
Okay.

236
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,691
Just check.

237
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,632
What'll it be now'?

238
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,699
Is she gone'?
I'm afraid to look.

239
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:54,341
Aw, damn it!

240
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:55,844
Oh, no.

241
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:02,552
Damn it!
What a Wasted night!

242
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:09,924
I hope you haven't been
upsetting her.

243
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:12,359
- What?
- Miss Mallow.

244
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:14,692
I hope you haven't
been upsetting her.

245
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:16,788
She shouldn't be upset.

246
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:18,197
Why not?

247
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:21,828
Her heart. She had a mild attack
on her last job.

248
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:23,600
That's Why she had to leave.

249
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:25,402
You're kidding me.

250
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,204
You mean she didn't tell you'?

251
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:28,573
No.

252
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:32,342
Really? I thought you two
told each other everything.

253
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,274
Whoa!

254
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,809
What's the matter
with you today, Philly?

255
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:48,907
Huh?

256
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:51,544
You've hardly said
a word to me all day.

257
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,452
Oh.

258
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:56,992
Are you mad at me for teasing
you for looking up my dress?

259
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:58,686
No.

260
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:02,198
- Are you sure'?
- Yeah.

261
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:08,160
Well, then what is it'?

262
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,103
I dunno.

263
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:16,672
Are you too tired to talk to me'?

264
00:22:16,768 --> 00:22:18,907
I guess so.

265
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:22,213
Hard day on the old bike, huh'?

266
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,694
Come inside, dear.

267
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,960
Well, well, well.

268
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,432
Yes, well, big deal.

269
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:17,067
If you want to watch me
undress so badly,

270
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:18,664
Why don't you tell me'?

271
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:19,936
What?

272
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:23,501
I said if you want to watch me
undress so badly,

273
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:25,240
you should have told me.

274
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:26,839
What do you mean'?

275
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:29,077
Well, do you want to
watch me undress'?

276
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:32,178
Well, sure.

277
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:33,722
I guess so.

278
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:35,792
- Go and close the door.
- What?

279
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:37,792
I said close the door.

280
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:50,832
I'm not sure I got you right.

281
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,273
Did you want me in or out'?

282
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:55,402
Well, do you want
to watch me undress'?

283
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,241
- I guess so.
- Well, in then.

284
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:01,746
Have a seat.

285
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:09,322
Ready?

286
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:52,334
You still with me, Philly?

287
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:54,961
- Pardon'?
- Do you still want me to continue'?

288
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:58,007
Yeah. Yes, please.

289
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:03,070
Not growing bored'?

290
00:25:11,376 --> 00:25:12,787
Are you sure'?

291
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:14,516
Oh, yes.

292
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:32,369
Well'?

293
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:34,273
Huh?

294
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,004
What do you think of them'?

295
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:38,377
Huh?

296
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:41,644
My breasts, how do you like them'?

297
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,521
Oh...nice.

298
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,089
They're very nice.

299
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:51,288
Well'?

300
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,021
Would you like to touch them'?

301
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:54,188
Touch them'?

302
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:55,264
Yes.

303
00:25:58,123 --> 00:26:00,535
No. Not right now.

304
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:02,263
Thank you.

305
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,966
Are you sure'?

306
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:08,272
Yeah. Maybe later.

307
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:10,004
Okay.

308
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:12,308
But you still want me
to continue though.

309
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:18,017
Yes, please.

310
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:24,493
Here.

311
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,329
Here.

312
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:15,107
I think I'd better go now.

313
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,642
Oh, so soon'?

314
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:21,149
You Won't stay'?

315
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:23,617
No. I'm sorry. I don't think so.

316
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:26,188
Oh, what a pity.

317
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:28,987
All right. Good night, Philly.

318
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,457
Good night.

319
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:33,119
- And thank you. I really enjoyed it.
- No. Thank you.

320
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:35,095
We should do this
again sometime.

321
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:37,359
Yeah. Thank you.

322
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:01,222
Oh, Philly, it's you.

323
00:28:01,312 --> 00:28:02,723
Hi, Florence.

324
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:05,385
Sherman, it's for you!

325
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:10,690
- Isn't it a little late for visitors?
- We're makin' milkshakes in the kitchen.

326
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:14,259
Great. You'll never guess
what just happened to me.

327
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,997
- What?
- You wanna guess?

328
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:18,768
- No.
- Oh.

329
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:22,333
Oh, you boys have business
you wanna discuss?

330
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:24,004
Excuse me.

331
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:26,776
Get out of here, you creep.

332
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,976
- So, what's up'?
- Oh.

333
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:31,748
Okay. Well, about
ten minutes ago,

334
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:34,016
I'm walking past
Miss Mallow's bedroom,

335
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:37,321
and she stops me in the hall
and asks me if I wanna come inside.

336
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:38,758
Yeah?

337
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,989
So I say "sure"
and I go inside.

338
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:44,329
Then she asks me if I wanna
Watch her strip naked.

339
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:46,231
Naked?

340
00:28:46,324 --> 00:28:49,362
Yeah. So I say "sure"
and so she does.

341
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:51,873
She takes off all her clothes.

342
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:54,409
Everything.
And I mean everything.

343
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:55,807
So then what?

344
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,402
What do you mean
"so then what?"

345
00:28:57,502 --> 00:28:59,243
So then I came here
to tell you.

346
00:28:59,337 --> 00:29:01,044
Are you kidding me'?

347
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:03,676
Hey, Why do you think I'm kidding you'?

348
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:07,985
I suppose you screw your housekeeper
every goddamn night!

349
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,782
Not every night.

350
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:14,295
Oh, you and old Florence make
a great couple. You know that.

351
00:29:19,991 --> 00:29:22,403
- Yeah?
- Is something Wrong?

352
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:24,371
No. No, why'?

353
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:40,448
Are you embarrassed
about last night?

354
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:42,024
No. Why'?

355
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:47,757
Are you sure you're not embarrassed
about seeing me naked last night?

356
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:50,389
No. Why do you ask'?

357
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:53,730
Why don't you come
and visit me tonight

358
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:55,429
after I've finished
with the dishes?

359
00:29:58,196 --> 00:29:59,834
We could talk.

360
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:10,046
Sherm, Philly, I want you boys
to work on your backhand today.

361
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:13,953
Hey, hey! I don't want you peeking in the girls
locker room anymore either, huh'?

362
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:15,490
- Huh'?
" Okay

363
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,651
Go out and get 'em.

364
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:19,092
Boy, that guy is Weird!

365
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:21,858
Yeah, him and Lester
would make a great couple.

366
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:25,059
He's okay. He could have gotten us
thrown out of the club.

367
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:28,069
- What? For just copping a peek at the girls?
- Sure.

368
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,435
If we could have got
thrown out for that,

369
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:32,838
what you did with Mallow
could have gotten you arrested.

370
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:36,242
Shut up and play tennis, huh'?
Okay.

371
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:39,037
Aw, damn it!

372
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:41,174
Oh, I don't know!

373
00:30:41,272 --> 00:30:44,082
Oh, Sherman, pick up the balls.

374
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:46,553
I mean, you're very impatient.

375
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:48,123
Now you ready'?

376
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:50,159
- Yeah.
- Here it comes!

377
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:56,156
You moron!

378
00:30:56,254 --> 00:30:58,291
You stupid moron!
That hurt!

379
00:30:58,389 --> 00:31:00,335
Okay, come on.
Hit the ball.

380
00:31:01,392 --> 00:31:02,837
Hey, Philly,

381
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:05,203
were old Mallow's knockers this big'?

382
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:07,071
What?

383
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:09,645
- You know that's not fair. You know that?
- Too bad!

384
00:31:09,734 --> 00:31:11,338
All right. Come on. Hit it.

385
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,851
How come you didn't touch 'em'?

386
00:31:19,944 --> 00:31:21,355
I didn't know how.

387
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:25,326
You just grab 'em
like this and squeeze.

388
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:27,020
How the hell would you know'?

389
00:31:27,118 --> 00:31:29,530
When was the last time
you saw a knocker'?

390
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:40,573
Hey, Philly, Sue Ellen Turner
will let you look at hers for a dollar.

391
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:43,874
How come you didn't touch 'em'?
Huh, big boy'?

392
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:46,209
Well, she's gotta be in the mood.

393
00:31:46,304 --> 00:31:48,011
Besides, I'm a leg man.

394
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:49,676
You know you're crazy.

395
00:31:49,774 --> 00:31:51,219
- You ready?
- Yeah!

396
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:52,652
You ready again?

397
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,280
Yeah, come on. Let's go.

398
00:31:59,183 --> 00:32:00,560
Backhand, Philly.

399
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:03,360
- Backhand.
- Yes, sir, Mr. Travis.

400
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:11,363
Pathetic.

401
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,003
Let's go. Hit it.

402
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:19,445
Be sure and tell me
about tonight,

403
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:21,483
lover boy.

404
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,782
Come in.

405
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:35,796
Hi.

406
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:39,027
I looked for you in your room
and you weren't there.

407
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,194
You said you wanted
to talk to me'?

408
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,862
Come in, Philly.
Come in.

409
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:46,431
What are you doing
in my father's bathtub?

410
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:49,637
Oh, I don't think he would have
minded my using his primie.

411
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:51,577
- Do you'?
- No, I guess not.

412
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:54,809
Would you like to Wash my back?

413
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:56,579
Well...

414
00:33:20,264 --> 00:33:22,107
Would you like to join me'?

415
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,611
Would I like to what?

416
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:25,146
Take a bath with me'?

417
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:27,648
You mean in there with you
right now'?

418
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:28,809
Mm-hmm.

419
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:31,045
Why don't you try it'?

420
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:32,644
Maybe you'll like it.

421
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:35,520
Well, I probably
wouldn't even fit in there.

422
00:33:35,613 --> 00:33:37,217
Oh, yes you would.

423
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:39,522
I promise.

424
00:33:40,718 --> 00:33:43,494
You mean you want me to take off
all my clothes and everything?

425
00:33:43,588 --> 00:33:46,262
Do you usually Wear them
when you take a bath'?

426
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:47,995
No, not usually.

427
00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:49,503
Oh, come on, Philly.

428
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:51,938
I Won't even look.

429
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,942
I don't know.

430
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:57,377
Oh, come on.
It will be an adventure.

431
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,449
Well...all right.

432
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:03,884
Good.

433
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:05,511
Hey, Where are you going'?

434
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,283
To get undressed.

435
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:21,769
Well, hello.

436
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:23,270
Hi.

437
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:26,365
Don't you want to take
your robe off and join me'?

438
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:28,603
Okay, just a sec.

439
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:32,511
Bathing trunks'?

440
00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:35,082
Well, that's marvelous.

441
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:37,676
Won't you take them off'?

442
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:39,049
No.

443
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:41,782
Well, all right then.

444
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:44,587
Come in the bath
with your bathing trunks.

445
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:49,156
Now be careful.

446
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,932
Be careful. Watch it.

447
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,201
I'll Wash your shoulder.

448
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,979
Well, how does that feel'?

449
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:28,299
Are you sure you don't want
to take them off'?

450
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:31,965
Okay, under one condition.

451
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:33,474
And what's that?

452
00:35:33,564 --> 00:35:35,237
That we put out the lights.

453
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:36,869
It's a deal.

454
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:40,146
Be careful.

455
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:46,445
Be careful.

456
00:35:51,716 --> 00:35:54,287
- Can I help you'?
- No thanks.

457
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:08,442
I think I'd better go now.

458
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:10,206
Philly, Wait a second.

459
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:21,516
- Wait a second, will you'?
- What?

460
00:36:23,047 --> 00:36:24,617
I'm sorry.

461
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:26,626
Will you forgive me'?

462
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:28,424
Okay.

463
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,294
Hey, prove it.

464
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:31,890
H ow'?

465
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:34,196
By sleeping with me tonight.

466
00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:37,266
No thanks.

467
00:36:40,097 --> 00:36:41,508
Why not?

468
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,875
Well, I tried it once before
in summer camp

469
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:46,141
and I know for a fact that you can't

470
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:50,652
get a good night's sleep when someone else
is in the same bunk with you.

471
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:53,517
Well, thank you.
It's been a lovely evening.

472
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:58,985
Just to show that
there's no hard feelings,

473
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:01,563
would you kiss me good night?

474
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:03,131
Okay.

475
00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:08,829
Is it all right
if I kiss you good night?

476
00:37:08,926 --> 00:37:10,701
I guess so.

477
00:37:29,113 --> 00:37:32,287
Bath! Are you kidding'?

478
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:34,795
Give me your hand.

479
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:37,092
Who the heck takes baths
with other people?

480
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:38,667
Except for the Japanese
I mean.

481
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,167
Have you heard of any'?

482
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,204
No. Nobody except the Japanese.

483
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:43,704
- Did you touch 'em'?
- What?

484
00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:45,432
Her knockers,
did you touch them'?

485
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:47,668
- Well, sort of.
- What do you mean "sort of"?

486
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:49,438
Thank you.
Did you or didn't you'?

487
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:52,776
Well, not with my hands.
With my elbows.

488
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:54,315
Doesn't that get broads hot,

489
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:56,351
touching their knockers,
even with your elbows?

490
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,817
I don't know.

491
00:37:57,908 --> 00:37:59,785
Aw, to hell with this.

492
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:06,692
Nice girls let you
touch their knockers

493
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:09,424
if they like you or
if they're going steady with you.

494
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,693
If they let you get any farther
than that,

495
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:15,327
either they have to be a Whore
or they're married to you, isn't that right'?

496
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:16,837
I don't know.

497
00:38:16,927 --> 00:38:19,806
Hey, Philly, stay out
of my sun, all right'?

498
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:22,673
- Hey, Philly, you wanna know what I think?
- What?

499
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:25,043
- I think Miss Mallow's a whore.
- No, she's not.

500
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:26,615
- Yes, she is.
- No, she's not.

501
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:29,548
Just because she took a bath
with me doesn't make her a Whore.

502
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:33,315
- Lots of people take baths with other people.
- Who?

503
00:38:33,411 --> 00:38:36,324
The Japanese.
You said so yourself.

504
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:38,087
Maybe she's part Japanese?

505
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:40,594
Hey, Philly, wanna know
what else I think?

506
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:43,222
- What?
- I think you're falling for her.

507
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:47,667
- You're crazy.
- No, I'm not.

508
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:50,204
- Well, Sherman.
- What?

509
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:54,807
Listen, Sherman.

510
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:56,207
What?

511
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,974
Do you think that if a guy
touches a woman's knockers--

512
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:01,243
not on a date,
but in his own house--

513
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,717
think it would still count
as getting to second base'?

514
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:05,981
With his hands
or with his elbows?

515
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:09,923
- With his hands.
- No, I think it has to be on a real date.

516
00:39:10,948 --> 00:39:13,155
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

517
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,728
Excuse me.

518
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:54,860
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

519
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:57,940
Excuse me.
Oh, excuse me, I'm--

520
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:00,941
Oh, hi, Joyce.

521
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:02,806
- Hi.
- Come on.

522
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:49,282
Don't you think she's one of
the most fantastic creatures?

523
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,917
- I like you better.
- You'll make me blush.

524
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:54,652
Hold on a second.

525
00:40:57,354 --> 00:40:58,958
- Hello'?
- Hello, son.

526
00:40:59,056 --> 00:41:00,467
Oh, hi, Dad.

527
00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:02,538
- <i>How you doin',</i> Philly?
- <i>Great. Just great.</i>

528
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:04,731
Good. Good.
Well, it's going pretty good here too,

529
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:07,673
and I've got a lot to tell you
when I get back.

530
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:11,178
By the way, how's the new bike
Working out'? Any snags?

531
00:41:11,268 --> 00:41:14,010
- Oh, no. The bike's just fine.
- Oh, that's <i>good.</i>

532
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:18,052
Glad to hear it. And Miss Mallow,
is she Working out okay too'?

533
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:21,453
Oh, yes. Miss Mallow's
working out fine too.

534
00:41:21,545 --> 00:41:22,956
<i>Oh, good.</i>

535
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:24,617
Put heron, will you'?

536
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:27,753
- You want to talk to her'?
- Yeah.

537
00:41:27,852 --> 00:41:30,162
She's not here right now.
She's in the john.

538
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:33,166
What's so funny'?

539
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:35,100
Oh, nothing, Dad.

540
00:41:35,192 --> 00:41:36,637
<i>Oh. Well, Philly, look.</i>

541
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:38,934
<i>I'm gonna have to
get off the phone now.</i>

542
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:41,635
I've got a lot of Work to do
before tomorrow's meeting.

543
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:44,178
Say good night to
Miss Mallow for me, will you'?

544
00:41:44,268 --> 00:41:47,647
Okay, I'll say good night
to Miss Mallow for you, Dad.

545
00:41:47,738 --> 00:41:50,275
- And you take care now, huh'?
- <i>Okay,</i> Dad.

546
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:52,877
- Okay, son. Good night.
- Good night, Dad.

547
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:19,710
Let me help you.

548
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:23,074
Thank you.

549
00:42:38,422 --> 00:42:40,333
Listen.

550
00:42:40,424 --> 00:42:42,904
Are we going to...

551
00:42:42,993 --> 00:42:44,563
YOU know'?

552
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:48,271
Would you like to'?

553
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:49,867
Except for one thing.

554
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:51,378
What?

555
00:42:51,468 --> 00:42:55,075
Well, I don't really know how.

556
00:42:57,541 --> 00:43:00,613
Well, I might be able to show you.

557
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:02,782
Good.

558
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,884
I'd just like to say
one thing before we start.

559
00:43:05,983 --> 00:43:08,793
- What?
- That I respect you.

560
00:43:08,886 --> 00:43:12,527
I don't think that you're a Whore
or anything like that.

561
00:43:12,623 --> 00:43:15,194
That's very sweet of you, Philly.

562
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:20,804
I'd also say that
I'm prepared to marry you...

563
00:43:20,898 --> 00:43:22,309
whenever you say.

564
00:43:22,399 --> 00:43:24,606
Oh, you don't have to say that.

565
00:43:24,702 --> 00:43:28,548
No, I'm not just saying that.
I'm not just handing you a line or anything.

566
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:30,641
I wanna marry you.

567
00:43:31,675 --> 00:43:33,746
Oh, Philly, listen to me.

568
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:37,685
A man and a Woman
should only get married

569
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:39,783
when they want to
raise a family together

570
00:43:39,883 --> 00:43:42,386
or they want to live together.

571
00:43:42,486 --> 00:43:43,931
What's wrong with that?

572
00:43:44,021 --> 00:43:46,627
A man and a Woman
should only get married

573
00:43:46,724 --> 00:43:48,226
when they love each other.

574
00:43:48,325 --> 00:43:50,464
But I do love you.

575
00:43:50,561 --> 00:43:52,336
Don't you love me'?

576
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:56,101
- I guess so.
- But you don't want to marry me.

577
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,838
- Is that it?
- I didn't say that.

578
00:43:57,935 --> 00:44:00,882
You didn't say that, but that's what
you were thinking, isn't it'?

579
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:05,078
Some silly-ass little kid has just told you
that he loves you and wants to marry you.

580
00:44:05,175 --> 00:44:07,985
It's probably all you can do
to keep from laughing out loud.

581
00:44:08,078 --> 00:44:10,615
- Philly, you're Wrong.
- I'm not Wrong.

582
00:44:10,714 --> 00:44:13,820
I should have kept
my big mouth shut.

583
00:44:19,089 --> 00:44:20,568
You what?

584
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:22,399
You asked her to marry you'?

585
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:23,938
What are you, sick'?

586
00:44:24,028 --> 00:44:27,840
I know. I should have played it cool,
strung her along a while.

587
00:44:27,931 --> 00:44:30,070
That's the Way
you have to treat women.

588
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:32,306
So tell me, did you get
to second base'?

589
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:34,644
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- Was it fun'?

590
00:44:34,738 --> 00:44:36,376
Oh, sure. You know.

591
00:44:36,473 --> 00:44:40,922
- But Why'd you have to ask her to marry you'?
- What?

592
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:42,820
If she's that easy,
she's probably a Whore.

593
00:44:42,913 --> 00:44:44,483
- She is not a Whore.
- Is too.

594
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:46,288
Is not.

595
00:46:12,402 --> 00:46:16,009
Listen. I just wanted to apologize
for the Way I've been acting.

596
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:18,177
Guess I've been acting
very juvenile lately,

597
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:20,050
and I'm sorry.

598
00:46:20,144 --> 00:46:21,817
Okay'?

599
00:46:21,912 --> 00:46:25,291
Well, I guess we might
just go steady for a while.

600
00:46:25,382 --> 00:46:26,918
Fantastic!

601
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,479
I love that dress you're wearing.

602
00:47:51,568 --> 00:47:53,514
- It's really beautiful.
- Thank you.

603
00:47:53,604 --> 00:47:55,743
Well, Where do you plan
to take me tonight?

604
00:47:55,839 --> 00:48:00,151
I have this little place that I know.
I think you'll enjoy it.

605
00:48:00,244 --> 00:48:03,487
Oh, Lester seems
to be in a good mood.

606
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:06,319
So am I.

607
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:10,765
Hop in.

608
00:48:14,324 --> 00:48:17,305
Thank you for the corsage.
It's truly beautiful.

609
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:19,101
Oh, glad you like it.

610
00:48:47,224 --> 00:48:49,932
And the Chateaubriand for two.

611
00:48:50,027 --> 00:48:52,268
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

612
00:48:52,362 --> 00:48:55,673
And I think I'll have a glass
of White Wine to go with it.

613
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:57,439
Madame is perhaps mistaken.

614
00:48:57,534 --> 00:48:59,810
With the red meat
we have the red wine.

615
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:02,816
Excuse me.
The lady prefers the White wine.

616
00:49:02,906 --> 00:49:05,216
I'd like you to bring her
what she prefers.

617
00:49:05,309 --> 00:49:09,416
Whatever you say, monsieur.
You are the boss, no'?

618
00:49:18,055 --> 00:49:22,731
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

619
00:49:22,826 --> 00:49:25,602
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

620
00:49:25,696 --> 00:49:27,972
<i>Which nobody can deny</i>

621
00:49:34,104 --> 00:49:36,983
Monsieur wish some dessert'?

622
00:49:37,074 --> 00:49:38,678
The Napoleon peut-étre?

623
00:49:38,775 --> 00:49:41,312
<i>The rhum au babe?
The mousse au chocolat?</i>

624
00:49:41,411 --> 00:49:43,652
The mousse is very nice
for you, madame.

625
00:49:43,747 --> 00:49:46,921
It is, how you say, succulent.

626
00:49:47,017 --> 00:49:48,860
No. Thank you very much.
We've had enough.

627
00:49:48,952 --> 00:49:50,795
Monsieur wishes a coffee?

628
00:49:50,887 --> 00:49:52,992
The tea'? The espresso?

629
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:56,503
The cappuccino?
The Sanka brand decaffeinated coffee?

630
00:49:56,593 --> 00:49:58,903
The cappuccino is very nice
for you, madame.

631
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:00,805
No, thank you.
Really, We've had enough.

632
00:50:00,897 --> 00:50:02,899
Madame wishes
the after-dinner liqueur'?

633
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,311
The Kahlua, the Sambuca,
the Aparet'?

634
00:50:06,403 --> 00:50:08,110
I said We've had enough.

635
00:50:08,205 --> 00:50:09,741
Ah, ah, ah.

636
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,787
Monsieur wishes the after-dinner mint.
The Frango mint.

637
00:50:12,876 --> 00:50:15,686
The check.
May we just have the check please?

638
00:50:58,288 --> 00:51:00,791
Thank you, Lester.

639
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:03,633
- And thank you for a lovely evening.
- You're welcome.

640
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:07,732
Did you believe that Waiter
with his funny accent?

641
00:51:07,831 --> 00:51:10,744
Oh, God.
I'm so proud of you.

642
00:51:10,834 --> 00:51:13,314
You're a real gentleman,
you know?

643
00:51:17,441 --> 00:51:19,352
Miss Mallow...

644
00:51:19,443 --> 00:51:21,320
I love you.

645
00:51:27,617 --> 00:51:28,857
Ouch!

646
00:51:28,952 --> 00:51:30,454
Oh, sorry.

647
00:51:30,554 --> 00:51:32,727
Philly, turn on the lights, will you'?

648
00:54:23,793 --> 00:54:26,797
Excuse me, but am I hurting you'?

649
00:54:32,168 --> 00:54:33,704
Miss Mallow, are you okay?

650
00:54:33,803 --> 00:54:35,510
Miss Mallow?

651
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:37,551
Miss Mallow?

652
00:54:37,641 --> 00:54:39,621
Oh, no.

653
00:54:39,709 --> 00:54:41,848
Miss Mallow?

654
00:54:46,549 --> 00:54:48,222
Oh, my God!
She's dead!

655
00:55:02,332 --> 00:55:04,403
Philly, What is it'?
What is it'?

656
00:55:06,002 --> 00:55:07,447
- What is it'?
- <i>I</i> killed--

657
00:55:07,537 --> 00:55:08,948
- Calm down.
- I killed her.

658
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:13,010
- Philly, what are you saying?
- I killed Miss Mallow!

659
00:55:13,109 --> 00:55:14,588
Come on.

660
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,279
She's dead.

661
00:55:45,108 --> 00:55:47,452
I want to know how
this happened, Philly.

662
00:55:47,544 --> 00:55:51,754
I want to know what filthy thing
you were doing. I want you to tell me.

663
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:53,850
It must have been her heart.

664
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:55,987
She said she had a weak heart.

665
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:02,503
Operator, get me the police.

666
00:56:02,592 --> 00:56:04,663
Don't!

667
00:56:04,761 --> 00:56:07,207
- Please don't tell them I did it!
- Hold please.

668
00:56:07,297 --> 00:56:10,176
What do you want me to tell them'?
That I did it'?

669
00:56:10,266 --> 00:56:11,836
Or that she did it herself?

670
00:56:11,935 --> 00:56:13,915
They're not going to believe that,
you know.

671
00:56:14,003 --> 00:56:16,415
Don't tell them anything!
You don't have to call them!

672
00:56:16,506 --> 00:56:21,353
Please hang up the phone, Lester!
I'll do anything! Please just help me!

673
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:26,049
Very well.

674
00:56:26,149 --> 00:56:29,358
May I suggest we begin
by covering her up'?

675
00:56:32,489 --> 00:56:37,199
Perhaps we should put her somewhere Where
it's cool so she doesn't rot too quickly.

676
00:56:44,434 --> 00:56:47,972
What are you gonna do with
all this food'? Won't it spoil?

677
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:51,678
Would you rather the food spoil
or Miss Mallow spoil'?

678
00:56:57,447 --> 00:56:59,791
Well, that should be sufficient.

679
00:56:59,883 --> 00:57:02,193
Let's pop her in, shall we'?

680
00:57:04,487 --> 00:57:07,491
On three.
One. . .two. . .three.

681
00:57:08,658 --> 00:57:10,660
Like a sack of potatoes.

682
00:57:12,162 --> 00:57:14,938
Mash her down.

683
00:57:15,031 --> 00:57:17,307
Those Europeans never did fit in.

684
00:57:19,135 --> 00:57:23,174
We can't just leave her Where
she is for too long, you know.

685
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:26,379
Your father will be home
in a week or two.

686
00:57:26,476 --> 00:57:30,481
Suppose he takes it into his mind to
get some lamb chops from his freezer?

687
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:33,823
I think your father,
from what I know of him,

688
00:57:33,917 --> 00:57:36,227
would be quite disappointed
to find Miss Mallow

689
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:39,232
instead of lamb chops
in his freezer, don't you'?

690
00:57:39,322 --> 00:57:40,460
That's not necessary.

691
00:57:40,557 --> 00:57:42,127
Perhaps not.

692
00:57:42,225 --> 00:57:45,695
But it is worthy
of your consideration, Philly.

693
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:49,572
Don't you think your father
would be more than disappointed

694
00:57:49,666 --> 00:57:53,773
to find Miss Mallow all frozen,
rock hard in his freezer

695
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:56,043
instead of some nice
baby lamb chops'?

696
00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:11,394
Aren't you gonna help?

697
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:13,490
It's not my body.

698
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:19,697
Come on, Lester.
Can't you help me'?

699
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:34,245
Boy, this is really hard.

700
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:37,814
Yes. Well, you've heard
the expression "frozen stiff."

701
00:58:37,914 --> 00:58:40,793
This is ridiculous.
Philly, let's flip her over.

702
00:58:40,884 --> 00:58:43,387
Here. On the count
of three. This way.

703
00:58:43,486 --> 00:58:45,989
One. . .two. . .three.

704
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:48,161
Got it'?

705
00:58:48,258 --> 00:58:49,896
- Barely.
- Good.

706
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:54,440
Are you okay'?

707
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:56,909
Yes, actually,
I quite enjoyed it, Philly.

708
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,480
I'm having the time of my life.

709
00:59:03,006 --> 00:59:04,815
Okay.

710
00:59:12,081 --> 00:59:13,890
Are you ready?

711
00:59:13,983 --> 00:59:15,587
Good.

712
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:15,085
Yes, what is it now, Philly?

713
01:00:15,178 --> 01:00:17,215
It's Miss Mallow!
She's not there!

714
01:00:17,313 --> 01:00:19,816
She's not in her grave!
She's disappeared!

715
01:00:19,916 --> 01:00:22,157
- What are you talking about?
- She's not there.

716
01:00:22,251 --> 01:00:23,855
The grave's empty.
I saw it.

717
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:25,432
I'm Warning you, Philly.

718
01:00:25,521 --> 01:00:28,968
If this is your idea
of some sort of childish prank,

719
01:00:29,058 --> 01:00:31,538
I, for one, am not amused.

720
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:32,936
But it's not!

721
01:00:33,029 --> 01:00:35,441
I will not deal with this
as anything other than a joke.

722
01:00:35,531 --> 01:00:37,067
Ouch!

723
01:00:38,601 --> 01:00:40,478
See what he wants.

724
01:00:42,105 --> 01:00:43,209
Yes'?

725
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:47,618
I found this note for you
in your flower garden, Philly.

726
01:00:49,212 --> 01:00:50,782
Let's see it.

727
01:00:54,217 --> 01:00:58,290
"The flower you two buried
had to be transplanted."

728
01:00:58,388 --> 01:01:01,858
"Leave $10,000
in the flowerbed tonight,

729
01:01:01,958 --> 01:01:04,131
and it will be returned
soon afterwards."

730
01:01:04,227 --> 01:01:07,436
"PS. I hear the
police like flowers too."

731
01:01:08,965 --> 01:01:10,672
The gardener.

732
01:01:10,767 --> 01:01:13,873
You'd be surprised
at the number of people

733
01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:17,417
who go poking through the grounds
of the wealthy at night, my boy.

734
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:20,283
So, what's next?

735
01:01:20,376 --> 01:01:23,482
Gosh, Lester, I don't know.

736
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:30,957
Lester, I just can't think of
any other Way to get the money.

737
01:01:31,054 --> 01:01:33,330
Neither can I.

738
01:01:33,423 --> 01:01:35,801
Lester, you think
we should be doing this'?

739
01:01:35,892 --> 01:01:38,896
Well, Philly, do you
want Miss Mallow back'?

740
01:01:38,995 --> 01:01:43,671
- Of course.
- Then open the safe and get the 10,000.

741
01:01:45,501 --> 01:01:48,778
Who knows? Your father may
not even notice it's missing.

742
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:50,908
Fat chance.

743
01:01:53,776 --> 01:01:55,255
Do you mind'?

744
01:01:55,344 --> 01:01:57,221
Of course not.

745
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:08,632
What are we gonna tell my father when he
comes home and discovers $10,000 missing?

746
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:13,105
What are you going to tell him when Miss
Mallow's remains turn up at the police station?

747
01:02:25,274 --> 01:02:26,947
Hey, Lester, look at this.

748
01:02:27,043 --> 01:02:29,649
Good work, Philly.

749
01:02:51,334 --> 01:02:52,972
What are you doing here now'?

750
01:02:53,069 --> 01:02:54,639
Why aren't you at the hotel?

751
01:02:54,737 --> 01:02:57,411
Because I was sick of staying
at that sleazy place.

752
01:02:57,507 --> 01:02:59,214
Nicole, he'll see you.

753
01:02:59,308 --> 01:03:02,084
Well, I don't care.
I want him to see me.

754
01:03:02,178 --> 01:03:03,851
What is the matter with you'?

755
01:03:03,946 --> 01:03:06,927
What the hell is going on, Nicole?

756
01:03:07,016 --> 01:03:09,155
A belated case
of conscience maybe?

757
01:03:09,252 --> 01:03:10,697
Well, that's very sweet.

758
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:13,393
Look, the old man
may not be a prize,

759
01:03:13,489 --> 01:03:16,197
but the kid doesn't deserve
to have this done to him.

760
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:18,704
You've got a crush
on a 15-year-old boy.

761
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:19,865
Oh, shut up.

762
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:22,841
Tell me...
when you slept together,

763
01:03:22,932 --> 01:03:24,843
did he wet the bed'?

764
01:03:24,934 --> 01:03:28,040
I'm Warning you. If you don't shut up,
I'm going straight to--

765
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:31,710
What are you gonna do'? Tell me
what you're gonna do, sweet pants.

766
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:33,287
All right, I'll tell you.

767
01:03:33,376 --> 01:03:36,084
You're gonna do precisely
what I tell you to do.

768
01:03:36,179 --> 01:03:37,715
Right'?

769
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:39,225
Otherwise,

770
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:42,125
I'll have to tell
the immigration people

771
01:03:42,218 --> 01:03:45,597
that you're not only an illegal alien,
but a felon.

772
01:03:45,688 --> 01:03:47,167
A felon'?

773
01:03:47,256 --> 01:03:48,860
Yes.

774
01:03:49,959 --> 01:03:53,168
Seducing a minor--
that's a criminal offense,

775
01:03:53,262 --> 01:03:55,674
in case you didn't know.

776
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:26,002
Don't be frightened.

777
01:04:28,898 --> 01:04:30,878
Please don't run away.

778
01:04:39,642 --> 01:04:42,122
I'm sorry, Philly.

779
01:04:49,619 --> 01:04:52,031
You let me think
that you were dead--

780
01:04:52,121 --> 01:04:54,158
that I had killed you.

781
01:04:54,257 --> 01:04:55,793
Why'?

782
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:58,771
Why'd you do it'?
Was it just for the money'?

783
01:04:58,861 --> 01:05:00,397
Lester forced me into this mess.

784
01:05:00,496 --> 01:05:02,999
What'd he do,
put a gun to your head'?

785
01:05:03,099 --> 01:05:06,137
He threatened to tell immigration
that I was Working here illegally.

786
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:08,681
- Big deal.
- It was a big deal for me.

787
01:05:08,771 --> 01:05:11,547
I could have been deported.

788
01:05:11,641 --> 01:05:14,121
I had to do it.
Don't you see'?

789
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:17,487
You got your money.
Why don't you just take it and go away?

790
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:19,218
I'm on your side, Philly.

791
01:05:21,284 --> 01:05:23,025
I thought you loved me.

792
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:25,565
I don't trust you anymore.

793
01:05:25,655 --> 01:05:27,828
All right,
then I'll go to the police.

794
01:05:30,326 --> 01:05:32,272
No.

795
01:05:32,361 --> 01:05:35,103
Well, what do you
want me to do then'?

796
01:05:35,197 --> 01:05:37,177
I don't know.

797
01:05:43,873 --> 01:05:46,854
But I don't want you arrested.

798
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:48,479
Where's my father's $10,000?

799
01:05:48,577 --> 01:05:50,056
Lester has the money.

800
01:05:52,481 --> 01:05:56,327
Well, can you help me
try and get it back?

801
01:05:56,419 --> 01:05:58,524
Of course
I'll help you, Philly.

802
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:01,568
Dad's gonna be home day after tomorrow.
Gonna have to hurry.

803
01:06:01,657 --> 01:06:04,763
First we have to find
a place to hide you.

804
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:07,204
- Where'?
- I don't know.

805
01:06:08,264 --> 01:06:11,541
Sherman's potting shed.
I used to hide there all the time.

806
01:06:11,634 --> 01:06:14,410
Maybe we'd better hurry
to put some pressure on dear Lester.

807
01:06:14,503 --> 01:06:17,074
Yeah. I've got some ideas
about that already.

808
01:06:17,173 --> 01:06:19,119
Good.

809
01:06:25,614 --> 01:06:27,218
I missed you, Miss Mallow.

810
01:06:35,558 --> 01:06:38,095
But we came here to ask you a favor.

811
01:06:38,861 --> 01:06:40,841
Anything you need.

812
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:44,036
We just got blackmailed
for $10,000.

813
01:06:45,601 --> 01:06:47,171
Have you talked to the police?

814
01:06:47,269 --> 01:06:48,942
We can't go to the police.

815
01:06:49,038 --> 01:06:52,542
Oh, Mr. Travis,
Won't you please help us'?

816
01:06:52,641 --> 01:06:54,780
You need a policeman,
not a tennis instructor.

817
01:06:54,877 --> 01:06:58,757
Exactly. But we need you,
not a real cop.

818
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:00,418
You're joking.
Me, a policeman?

819
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:04,191
This guy is a real bully
and he scares easily.

820
01:07:04,286 --> 01:07:06,630
So all you have to do
is act like a tough cop.

821
01:07:06,722 --> 01:07:10,568
- But I don't know how to act like a cop.
- Just be hard and tough.

822
01:07:10,659 --> 01:07:14,402
And maybe we could watch <i>Dirty Harry</i>
on television tonight.

823
01:07:14,497 --> 01:07:16,943
Hi. I'm with the police department.

824
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:18,444
I'm Detective Jack Travis.

825
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:20,536
- You Fillmore?
- This is the Fillmore residence,

826
01:07:20,636 --> 01:07:23,412
but I am not Mr. Fillmore,
if that's what you're asking.

827
01:07:23,506 --> 01:07:25,315
I'd like to ask a few questions.

828
01:07:25,408 --> 01:07:26,819
- No.
- Thank you.

829
01:07:29,645 --> 01:07:32,091
Now see here.

830
01:07:32,181 --> 01:07:34,252
You.

831
01:07:34,350 --> 01:07:38,230
I really must object to your barging in here
without so much as a--

832
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:40,095
- Who are you'?
- Me'?

833
01:07:40,189 --> 01:07:43,568
- I'm the houseman and chauffeur.
- Name'?

834
01:07:43,659 --> 01:07:45,798
My name?
My name is Lester Lewis.

835
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:48,705
But I really must object, sir.
I believe--

836
01:07:48,798 --> 01:07:50,800
- Yes'?
- Shut up, Lester.

837
01:07:52,501 --> 01:07:54,174
Now then, Lester.

838
01:07:54,270 --> 01:07:56,341
Is there a Miss Nicole Mallow here?

839
01:07:56,439 --> 01:08:00,410
There is. That is, she used to be here.
She's gone.

840
01:08:00,509 --> 01:08:02,750
- Where did she go'?
- Away.

841
01:08:02,845 --> 01:08:05,416
To Tucson. She quit.

842
01:08:05,514 --> 01:08:07,721
She wasn't happy here I'm afraid.

843
01:08:07,817 --> 01:08:10,923
We received a tip
that she has met with foul play.

844
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:12,499
Foul play'?
What do you mean'?

845
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:15,626
Homicide.
This tip said she was homicided.

846
01:08:15,724 --> 01:08:17,704
Well...

847
01:08:17,793 --> 01:08:20,069
that's absurd.

848
01:08:20,162 --> 01:08:22,665
Miss Mallow is as alive as you or I.

849
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:25,336
I want to see her room now.

850
01:08:25,434 --> 01:08:27,880
I told you you'd find nothing
in Miss Mallow's room.

851
01:08:27,970 --> 01:08:30,109
What is the point of looking
through my room'?

852
01:08:30,206 --> 01:08:31,685
Harassment.

853
01:08:40,149 --> 01:08:43,358
Gee, Lester, you really do have
a very interesting sense of decoration.

854
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:44,795
Thank you.

855
01:08:44,887 --> 01:08:47,925
Yeah. Real interesting, Lester.

856
01:08:48,023 --> 01:08:50,833
Right <i>out of
“Better Homes and Closets.“</i>

857
01:08:52,862 --> 01:08:54,671
This a friend of yours?

858
01:08:54,763 --> 01:08:56,538
Yes.

859
01:08:56,632 --> 01:08:59,545
Cute. Real cute, Lester.

860
01:08:59,635 --> 01:09:02,013
You know, you're a real cutie-pie.

861
01:09:03,372 --> 01:09:05,409
This is particularly cute.

862
01:09:17,553 --> 01:09:19,794
This, I don't even want to know from.

863
01:09:21,223 --> 01:09:22,964
Oh, no.

864
01:09:23,058 --> 01:09:24,469
Pay dirt.

865
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:26,130
Planning a little trip, Lester?

866
01:09:26,228 --> 01:09:28,572
No, not exactly.

867
01:09:28,664 --> 01:09:30,575
Lovely things you Wear.

868
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:32,873
This must look just
divine on you...

869
01:09:32,968 --> 01:09:35,107
if you lose a little weight.

870
01:09:36,205 --> 01:09:38,014
These are Miss Mallow's clothes.

871
01:09:38,107 --> 01:09:41,919
She didn't have room for all of them
and she asked that we keep them here

872
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:44,355
and send them on after
she settled in Tucson.

873
01:09:44,446 --> 01:09:45,948
Isn't that right, Philly?

874
01:09:47,416 --> 01:09:49,953
Can I get you something
to drink, Officer?

875
01:09:50,052 --> 01:09:53,261
Some tea, a coffee,
a beer perhaps?

876
01:09:53,355 --> 01:09:55,164
- Oh, boy.
- Oh, no.

877
01:09:55,257 --> 01:09:58,830
Lester, there's more dirty laundry here
than I thought.

878
01:09:59,962 --> 01:10:02,704
What is this big red spot here'?
Is this blood'?

879
01:10:02,798 --> 01:10:04,072
Tomato sauce.

880
01:10:04,166 --> 01:10:06,168
- Tomato sauce?
- Yes.

881
01:10:06,268 --> 01:10:09,272
Miss Mallow was fond
of eating lasagna in bed,

882
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:11,373
and she frequently spilled it.

883
01:10:11,473 --> 01:10:13,248
Will you hold this'?

884
01:10:15,177 --> 01:10:18,181
Lester, I don't believe a word
you've told me so far.

885
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:20,556
And as far as I'm concerned,
Miss Mallow was homicided.

886
01:10:20,649 --> 01:10:24,654
And you, my friend, you are the best thing
that I have for a perpetrator.

887
01:10:24,753 --> 01:10:27,393
I think I'm gonna take you down.
I'm gonna book you.

888
01:10:27,489 --> 01:10:30,299
Give me a couple of hours,
I can prove she's still alive.

889
01:10:30,392 --> 01:10:31,564
- You can'?
- Yes.

890
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:33,765
How are you gonna do that
with her in Tucson'?

891
01:10:33,862 --> 01:10:36,672
Gee, Lester, are you
sure it was Tucson?

892
01:10:37,766 --> 01:10:39,507
- She's not in Tucson.
- She's not'?

893
01:10:39,602 --> 01:10:40,740
No.

894
01:10:42,805 --> 01:10:44,284
Oh, boy.

895
01:10:47,109 --> 01:10:49,020
This is gonna be tough.

896
01:10:52,982 --> 01:10:54,393
Where is she'?

897
01:10:54,483 --> 01:10:55,894
She's elsewhere.

898
01:10:55,985 --> 01:10:57,396
Where elsewhere?

899
01:10:57,486 --> 01:11:00,763
Well, she's having an abortion.

900
01:11:00,856 --> 01:11:03,166
I didn't want the boy to know.

901
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:04,795
That's good you did that.

902
01:11:04,893 --> 01:11:06,338
Save that boy any pain.

903
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:10,432
She'll be back in three hours.

904
01:11:10,532 --> 01:11:11,943
- Three hours?
- Mm-hmm.

905
01:11:12,034 --> 01:11:14,913
Good. I'm gonna
see you in two hours.

906
01:11:15,004 --> 01:11:16,847
- Two hours?
- Yeah.

907
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:21,581
And you better be able to prove that girl is alive
or I'm gonna book you for murder one.

908
01:11:21,677 --> 01:11:23,315
You can't book me for murder.

909
01:11:23,412 --> 01:11:26,518
If you don't have a body,
you don't have a case.

910
01:11:26,615 --> 01:11:28,822
Come on, Lester.
Up, up, up, up.

911
01:11:28,917 --> 01:11:31,864
Listen. Now don't get any
bright ideas about leaving town

912
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:33,763
- 'cause I'm gonna be watching you.
- Okay.

913
01:11:33,856 --> 01:11:36,996
Now, I'm gonna see you
in two hours from right now.

914
01:11:37,092 --> 01:11:38,435
- Do you hear me'?
- Yes.

915
01:11:38,527 --> 01:11:39,665
You hear me'?

916
01:11:39,762 --> 01:11:41,332
Yes, I do.

917
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,711
Thank you, Officer.

918
01:11:48,737 --> 01:11:52,241
You know, Lester, I think it's shocking
the way that man treats you.

919
01:11:52,341 --> 01:11:55,220
I don't know Why
you put up with it.

920
01:12:03,218 --> 01:12:04,891
Good afternoon, sir.

921
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:09,629
I'm looking for the young foreign Woman
I checked in here the other day.

922
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:14,470
It's a matter of some urgency.

923
01:12:14,563 --> 01:12:16,873
You don't know
where she is now'?

924
01:12:16,965 --> 01:12:19,275
If it's the Woman
that I'm thinking of,

925
01:12:19,368 --> 01:12:21,814
I think I checked her out
earlier this morning.

926
01:12:21,904 --> 01:12:25,215
Checked her out'?
Did she mention Where she was going'?

927
01:12:26,041 --> 01:12:28,851
Walter, will you get that cat
out of the lobby?

928
01:12:28,944 --> 01:12:32,153
Listen my friend.

929
01:12:32,247 --> 01:12:37,196
Are you quite certain you don't recall her
mentioning where she might be headed?

930
01:12:41,423 --> 01:12:43,027
Well, now that you mention it,

931
01:12:43,125 --> 01:12:46,663
I believe she said something
about going to Tucson.

932
01:13:09,084 --> 01:13:11,860
It Worked. Travis scared Lester.
He's looking all over for you.

933
01:13:11,954 --> 01:13:15,197
You don't know him.
He'll pick up the money and run.

934
01:13:15,290 --> 01:13:17,861
Sherman, can we borrow a oar'?
It's an emergency.

935
01:13:19,928 --> 01:13:21,464
Sure, come on.

936
01:13:21,563 --> 01:13:23,975
If we catch him now,
I'm sure he'll have the money with him.

937
01:13:24,066 --> 01:13:26,512
- Get in.
- Philly, I can't drive.

938
01:13:26,602 --> 01:13:29,014
- Neither can I. Can you'?
- Sure. Get in.

939
01:13:34,276 --> 01:13:36,483
Come on, Sherman. Move it.

940
01:13:40,949 --> 01:13:43,520
I can't help it!
I don't know how to drive.

941
01:13:43,619 --> 01:13:45,599
Why didn't you tell us before'?

942
01:13:47,990 --> 01:13:51,130
- Get off the sidewalk!
- I'm trying!

943
01:14:18,053 --> 01:14:20,090
Oh! Watch out!

944
01:14:20,189 --> 01:14:21,930
Watch out!
Don't hit that car!

945
01:14:22,024 --> 01:14:23,435
I'm trying not to!

946
01:14:23,525 --> 01:14:25,232
Watch out, there's a cop!

947
01:14:54,122 --> 01:14:56,124
You just missed that--

948
01:14:56,225 --> 01:14:57,863
You're insane.
You know that?

949
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:00,497
- Don't hit him, will you'?
- I'm trying not to!

950
01:15:16,645 --> 01:15:19,785
Please, Mr. Green,
it's terribly terribly important.

951
01:15:19,882 --> 01:15:21,589
Please, yes, please.

952
01:15:27,890 --> 01:15:30,837
Yes, thank you! Yes!

953
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:39,879
Please, Mr. Green.

954
01:15:39,968 --> 01:15:41,379
Are you ready, Lester?

955
01:15:41,470 --> 01:15:43,472
Yes, I'm ready!

956
01:15:53,048 --> 01:15:55,585
I'm ready, Mr. Green!

957
01:16:13,168 --> 01:16:15,341
Mr. Green, we need your help.

958
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:25,090
I don't believe it.

959
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:27,888
You want a chase, you sicko'?
I'll give you a chase.

960
01:16:35,958 --> 01:16:38,370
Get out of the way, you little shit!

961
01:17:21,603 --> 01:17:23,344
Excuse me.

962
01:17:23,438 --> 01:17:25,315
Huh?

963
01:17:25,407 --> 01:17:27,409
Lester, over here.

964
01:17:29,845 --> 01:17:31,153
Good day, sir.

965
01:17:32,881 --> 01:17:34,758
Thanks a lot, Mr. Green.

966
01:17:34,850 --> 01:17:36,158
I've been waiting 20 minutes.

967
01:17:36,251 --> 01:17:37,958
Sorry, sir. It's been a difficult day.

968
01:17:38,053 --> 01:17:41,034
And where's your tie'?
I always want you to wear a tie.

969
01:17:41,123 --> 01:17:42,261
I'm sorry.

970
01:17:42,357 --> 01:17:44,803
Lester! Oh, hi, Dad.

971
01:17:44,893 --> 01:17:48,500
Hello, son. It was nice of you
to come out and meet me.

972
01:17:48,597 --> 01:17:51,339
Lester, you take this and the baggage
is in the baggage area.

973
01:17:51,433 --> 01:17:53,538
- I'll get that, sir.
- Lester, let me help you.

974
01:17:53,635 --> 01:17:55,546
- I can get that.
- No, I insist.

975
01:18:00,075 --> 01:18:02,681
- Really, I insist.
- No, it's my job.

976
01:18:02,778 --> 01:18:04,951
I'll be right back, sir.
Philly, please, please.

977
01:18:05,047 --> 01:18:08,119
Oh, Lester!
Where are you going'?

978
01:18:08,216 --> 01:18:11,527
Well, I was late picking up
my employer, Mr. Fillmore.

979
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:17,161
May I present Detective Travis,
my employer, Mr. Fillmore.

980
01:18:17,259 --> 01:18:18,863
- You're Fillmore?
- That's right.

981
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:20,769
Hold on, Lester.
Don't go away.

982
01:18:20,862 --> 01:18:26,005
By the way, Travis, I would also
like to present Miss Nicole Mallow.

983
01:18:26,101 --> 01:18:28,342
Nice to see you again, Jack.

984
01:18:28,437 --> 01:18:30,849
Oh, Nicole and I are old friends.

985
01:18:30,939 --> 01:18:32,282
- And you're Fillmore?
- Yes.

986
01:18:32,374 --> 01:18:34,012
- The father?
- That's right.

987
01:18:34,109 --> 01:18:37,750
- I want to know what's going on here.
- So do I.

988
01:18:40,348 --> 01:18:43,352
Well, it seems
it's a mystery to all of us.

989
01:18:43,452 --> 01:18:44,931
Shall we be going, sir'?

990
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:48,490
Oh, you get the rest of the baggage
and I'll take this one.

991
01:18:48,590 --> 01:18:50,570
Very well, sir.

992
01:18:56,732 --> 01:18:59,008
Excuse me.

993
01:19:17,185 --> 01:19:19,597
Well, you've certainly
changed a lot lately.

994
01:19:19,688 --> 01:19:22,498
I know, but most of
the credit belongs to you.

995
01:19:22,591 --> 01:19:24,127
Thank you.

996
01:19:26,027 --> 01:19:28,098
And Lester too, of course.

997
01:19:29,865 --> 01:19:31,936
Philly, I'm going to miss you.

998
01:19:32,033 --> 01:19:33,512
What do you mean'?

999
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:36,845
Well, I mean I think
that it's time for me to leave.

1000
01:19:36,938 --> 01:19:38,349
Why'?

1001
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:41,046
Well, for one thing,
we'll never be able to keep

1002
01:19:41,143 --> 01:19:43,851
our affair a secret
from your father.

1003
01:19:43,945 --> 01:19:47,518
And the moment he found out,
he'd fire me immediately.

1004
01:19:48,884 --> 01:19:52,093
I guess you're right.
But I don't want you to leave.

1005
01:19:52,187 --> 01:19:53,723
I'll miss you.

1006
01:19:53,822 --> 01:19:55,324
We'll always keep in touch.

1007
01:19:55,423 --> 01:19:58,427
Anyway, you're ready
to be on your own now.

1008
01:20:02,964 --> 01:20:05,069
Where are you gonna go'?

1009
01:20:05,167 --> 01:20:06,976
I don't know.

1010
01:20:07,068 --> 01:20:09,446
I let you know Where I am.

1011
01:20:09,538 --> 01:20:11,779
If you're gonna get a new job,
you're gonna have to have

1012
01:20:11,873 --> 01:20:14,410
a letter of reference
from my father.

1013
01:20:14,509 --> 01:20:17,513
Well, your father might not think
I've been Working long enough.

1014
01:20:17,612 --> 01:20:19,683
I didn't mean for him to write it.

1015
01:20:19,781 --> 01:20:23,126
But I know what he'd say
if he knew you as well as I do.

1016
01:20:23,218 --> 01:20:26,461
"She was passionate
about her household duties."

1017
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:29,662
"And she kept things
well in hand."

1018
01:20:29,758 --> 01:20:33,171
"She gave everything she had
to her employer."

1019
01:23:25,467 --> 01:23:27,208
Thank you, Lester.

1020
01:23:27,302 --> 01:23:29,612
Lester, I'll see you at 3:00 then?

1021
01:23:30,839 --> 01:23:32,250
- Hi, Jan.
- Hi.

1022
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:34,650
- Hey, do you have Mr. Marks for Civics?
- Uh-huh.

1023
01:23:34,743 --> 01:23:36,552
Great, I'll see you there.

1024
01:23:38,913 --> 01:23:40,915
I'll see you sixth period.

1025
01:23:46,154 --> 01:23:47,895
Oh, Miss Phipps.

1026
01:23:47,989 --> 01:23:49,400
Hello there.

1027
01:23:49,491 --> 01:23:50,936
I'm sorry, I don't--

1028
01:23:52,527 --> 01:23:54,564
Philly. I didn't recognize you.

1029
01:23:54,662 --> 01:23:56,664
You've changed so much
since last June.

1030
01:23:56,765 --> 01:24:00,269
I know, and I'd like to thank you
for the advice you gave me.

1031
01:24:00,368 --> 01:24:01,972
What was that?

1032
01:24:02,070 --> 01:24:04,516
To find girls Whose age
is more appropriate for me.

1033
01:24:04,606 --> 01:24:06,517
Oh, right.
How did it go'?

1034
01:24:06,608 --> 01:24:08,315
Oh, it went very well.

1035
01:24:08,410 --> 01:24:11,050
I'd like to talk to you
about it in detail.

1036
01:24:11,146 --> 01:24:12,648
Great, I'd love to.

1037
01:24:12,747 --> 01:24:14,522
Excellent.

1038
01:24:14,616 --> 01:24:16,596
Can we discuss it
over dinner tonight'?

1039
01:24:22,490 --> 01:24:25,027
Why don't I have my chauffeur
pick you up at 8:00 then?

1040
01:25:54,282 --> 01:25:57,422
