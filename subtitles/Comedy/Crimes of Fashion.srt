2
00:00:08,908 --> 00:00:10,034
A great man.

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,136
He was loved by few others.

4
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:16,478
Although he leaves behind
no family...

5
00:00:16,549 --> 00:00:20,383
...he had an army of friends.

6
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:23,513
Be not sad for Dominic...

7
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:27,617
...no, for he has entered
a better world...

8
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:31,460
...a reward for a life
of selfless deeds...

9
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:32,896
...a pillar of the community.

10
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:35,264
Testing, testing.

11
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:44,034
That one.

12
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:51,015
That's it, fellas.

13
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:53,780
Smile for the camera.

14
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:01,594
Microphone's all set, sir.

15
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:02,650
Oh, good.

16
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:03,787
Take over the camera.

17
00:01:03,863 --> 00:01:06,832
Okay.

18
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:16,965
Uh, sir, uh...

19
00:01:17,043 --> 00:01:18,977
I've been doing
some thinking, and...

20
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:20,478
Yeah?

21
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:23,107
Well, since nobody knew what
Godfather Dominic looked like...

22
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:24,480
...how can we confirm that he died?

23
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:26,212
You see that funeral?

24
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:27,617
That's your confirmation.

25
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:29,052
Now, shut up, Jack.

26
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:30,646
I'm trying to gather
some evidence here.

27
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:31,655
Where's my pad?

28
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:36,286
I don't know.

29
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:40,433
This is gonna be bad.

30
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:42,533
Jack!

31
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:43,534
I'm sorry, sir.

32
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:44,535
It's my allergies.

33
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:48,335
This is a sad day, Georgie.

34
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:52,777
Your boss...
what can I say?

35
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:54,473
He was a credit
to organized crime.

36
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:03,178
Jack, now get control
of yourself.

37
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:04,518
You're gonna give us away.

38
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:20,732
Great.

39
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,638
Jack, you're suspended.

40
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:27,271
As family consigliere,
tell me...

41
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:28,974
who takes over now as Godfather?

42
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:30,015
Ah...

43
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,950
Shh!

44
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:35,010
Don't worry, Sal.

45
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:39,616
We got somebody.

46
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:40,716
You got somebody?

47
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:41,851
We got somebody.

48
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:44,928
Okay.

49
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:48,195
This ain't over.

50
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:49,257
Come on.
Let's go.

51
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:57,506
Hear that?

52
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:59,545
Yeah.

53
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:01,580
They probably got themselves
the toughest...

54
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,275
...meanest criminal
they could find.

55
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:08,812
Out went the confined corsets
with their impractical material...

56
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:11,049
...and in swept
a design revolution:

57
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:15,151
A modern dress with a cleaner,
straighter silhouette...

58
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:17,594
...leading us today,
100 years later...

59
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:22,431
...to the widely popular
belly shirt.

60
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:28,768
Miss, uh... Taylor.

61
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:34,075
Ow!

62
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:36,411
What?

63
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:38,313
Professor Kingfield, hi.

64
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,682
Yes, you with
the wrinkled sweatshirt.

65
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:43,051
Please stand
when answering a question.

66
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:44,817
Sorry.

67
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,951
I hope you all find
your final grades as amusing.

68
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:51,360
Miss Taylor,
I bought this suit in 1985

69
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:52,591
...off the rack at Bloomingdale's.

70
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:55,600
The label reads"Pierre Cardin."

71
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:57,898
Please explain and define
the historical.

72
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:00,269
...and sociological significance
of my purchase.

73
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,307
Okay.

74
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:02,341
Louder, please.

75
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:03,773
I can't hear you.

76
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:06,334
Pierre Cardin
was the first couture house.

77
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,937
...to offer prêt-à-porter
or luxury-wear clothing...

78
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:11,449
which is a staple
for fashion buying today.

79
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:13,246
That's why you could buy
that suit off the rack.

80
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,650
...at Bloomingdale's.

81
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,484
And the year Cardin
started it?

82
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:18,046
1959.

83
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:19,284
Well done, Miss Taylor.

84
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:20,656
Thank you.

85
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:23,355
Perhaps if you put as much
thought into your wardrobe.

86
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,829
...as you do into your homework.

87
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:30,593
Come ready tomorrow
to discuss.

88
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:35,664
...the political ramifications of
the culotte.

89
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:38,836
I'll make designers
out of you yet.

90
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:43,340
You know,
it's really not fair.

91
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,213
I spend every waking moment.

92
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,718
...designing clothes
for other people.

93
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,720
when I'm not working
on five different committees.

94
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,914
...or my part-time job.

95
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:51,684
And they expect me
to wear heels after that?

96
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:54,022
You're right.
That isn't fair.

97
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:56,857
I mean, who really has time
for their own appearance?

98
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:59,193
She does.

99
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:00,994
Her own design
every single day.

100
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:03,058
It's like she's
a walking billboard.

101
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,467
I don't know
how she does it.

102
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:06,801
I heard she doesn't.

103
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:09,273
They say she's been secretly
getting outside help.

104
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:10,309
What?

105
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:11,468
It's the hottest rumor.

106
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:12,772
Três scandalous!

107
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:14,972
It's official.
I truly hate her.

108
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:16,811
I do not believe that.
I'm sorry.

109
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:18,282
Hey, Brooke.

110
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:20,512
Um, listen, don't worry
about what Professor Kingfield.

111
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:22,053
...said in class today.

112
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:25,989
Maybe one day,
plain and ugly will be in style.

113
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:27,117
Hey, back off, Candace.

114
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:28,558
Yeah, you're just jealous.

115
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:30,255
Here's a news flash, ladies.

116
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,525
The meek and the dorky
don't inherit the arth.

117
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:34,065
The bold and the trendy do.

118
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:36,101
That's why my label CandaceWear.

119
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,262
will one day be America's
top-selling brand...

120
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,896
...and you three
will be designing.

121
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:43,339
...boys' underwear
for a children's catalog.

122
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:46,501
Okay, now I hate her.

123
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:47,944
Yeah.

124
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:52,508
Welcome to Fashion University,
where being the best means...

125
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:55,554
Brooke, the words
are all smeared.

126
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:57,020
How am I supposed to read that?

127
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,682
Maybe if you learned
your lines.

128
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:00,851
Let's go again.
Action!

129
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:02,895
Welcome to Fashion University...

130
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:06,227
where being the best means
looking your best.

131
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:07,596
Our motto is...

132
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,100
"Veni, suei, vici:

133
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:12,797
I came, I sewed, I conquered."

134
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:17,100
Where all the biggest names
in fashion.

135
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:18,973
...first learned to make
the world a prettier...

136
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:23,038
...more color-coordinated place
to live.

137
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,346
Cut!

138
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:26,783
You're welcome.

139
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:30,118
We have only one philosophy
here at Fashion University:

140
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:32,020
You are what you wear.

141
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:34,252
But don't worry.

142
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:35,351
After four years...

143
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:37,453
...you can count on it
being fabulous.

144
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,055
I designed this myself,
and you can too.

145
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:42,429
Cut, cut.

146
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:44,333
Sorry, sorry.

147
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,673
All right,
let's wrap this up, people.

148
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:51,209
Yeah, I hate her.

149
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:55,069
Oh, man, I'm late
for my wedding dress class.

150
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:56,308
Ugh, I'll see you guys later.

151
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:58,247
All right, bye.

152
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:09,251
Hey!

153
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:10,295
Hey, hey!

154
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,160
Do I throw trash in your house?

155
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:14,199
Ugh.
Freshman, I swear...

156
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,256
Hi, can I help you?

157
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:16,301
Get in the car.

158
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:17,427
Xcuse me, sir.

159
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,232
I took self-defense classes
in high school.

160
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:22,103
I know three ways to disarm
an attacker.

161
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:24,200
None of which apply right now.

162
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,539
Where are you taking me?

163
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:26,737
You will not be harmed.

164
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:28,007
Who are you?

165
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,605
I'm gonna be very late
for class.

166
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:31,945
Get in the car, please.

167
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:35,351
This is really gonna ruin
my perfect attendance.

168
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:37,252
Seriously,
where are you taking me?

169
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:40,121
Relax, Miss Taylor.
Buckle up.

170
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:42,627
It'll all be explained.
I promise.

171
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:45,630
You're part of the family now,
just like cousin Frankie.

172
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:47,188
Family.

173
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:48,324
Family?

174
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:21,732
You live here?

175
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:23,234
It was your grandfather
Dominic's.

176
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:25,236
Grandfather?
Wait, wait.

177
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:27,499
I don't have a grandfather.

178
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:30,599
I had a grandfather.

179
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:31,904
This is me.

180
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:33,605
I don't understand.

181
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,010
How did he die?

182
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:38,539
You might say heartache
over the loss of his family.

183
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:40,711
You mean my parents?

184
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:42,754
He wasn't the same
after the car accident.

185
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:44,016
Ate him up inside.

186
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:47,787
Why didn't he try
and contact me?

187
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,260
It was complicated.
It's complicated?

188
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:53,059
Sounds pretty simple to me.
He didn't care.

189
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:54,064
That isn't true.

190
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:56,397
He abandoned me
at foster care.

191
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:58,164
while livin' it up
in this mansion.

192
00:08:58,237 --> 00:08:59,261
What else is there to know?

193
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:00,305
He checked up on you.

194
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,533
He sent you toys and cards...

195
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:02,869
I was five.

196
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:05,308
I was shuffled
from one stranger to another.

197
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,845
I didn't want cards or candy.

198
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:09,814
I wanted a family.
I wanted a real family.

199
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,782
Wait, listen to me...
Why should I listen to you?

200
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:13,546
You're probably in
on this whole thing too.

201
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:15,587
This whole time,
I think I'm alone in the world...

202
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:17,885
...and then I find out
I had a grandfather...

203
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:20,824
...someone that I could have
gone to when I needed help.

204
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,417
And now he's gone.

205
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:24,292
Brooke...

206
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:27,389
I will never forgive him
for that.

207
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:30,924
Never.

208
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:36,875
Oh, what's that?
More bad news?

209
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:38,570
His will.
Keep it.

210
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:40,202
I don't care
about anything of his.

211
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:41,610
It was his last request...

212
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:43,979
...his dream that you take over
the family business.

213
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,416
Me run a business?

214
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:47,679
Are you serious?

215
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:53,417
Two seconds ago,
I find out I have a grandfather...

216
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:55,460
...and now I'm supposed
to take over his job?

217
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,499
What was he, anyways,
a rich stockbroker?

218
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:06,929
Lawyer?

219
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,030
Ooh!

220
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:13,435
It's not a toy.

221
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:16,140
Come on.
Into the kitchen.

222
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:17,773
Mob boss?

223
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:22,779
I was kidding.

224
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:23,822
It's not what you think.

225
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:25,186
I can't be a mob boss.

226
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:26,554
I'm an honest person.

227
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,890
I've never cheated on anything
in my entire life.

228
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,861
We've got plenty
of legal businesses too.

229
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:31,897
Oh, so that makes it okay?

230
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,398
Look, look,
I am a fashion student.

231
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,697
I design pretty clothes
that don't include gun holsters.

232
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:38,396
Your grandfather
wanted to go straight...

233
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,438
...but he ran out of time.

234
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:40,472
That's why we found you.

235
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:42,029
He wants you to finish
what he started.

236
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:43,302
Forget it.

237
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:45,310
You're the only one left.
We need you.

238
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:47,539
I have to get back to school.
I have a test to study for.

239
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:49,478
Brooke.

240
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:51,846
Your grandfather loved you.

241
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:54,886
That kind of love
I can live without.

242
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:12,431
Why can't my family
just be normal.

243
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,494
...like the Osbournes?

244
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:15,472
I had a nightmare
like this once.

245
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:16,565
You!

246
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:17,802
What are you doing here?

247
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:19,139
I'm not used to people
saying no.

248
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:20,371
In fact,
you might be the first.

249
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:21,538
Well, get used to it.

250
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:23,138
'cause I'm gonna say it
again right now.

251
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:24,204
No, no, no, N-O.

252
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:25,716
No, no, no, no, no.

253
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:29,050
Hey, Brooke, who, uh...
who's your little friend here?

254
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:32,386
Fashion cop come to arrest you
for this tired design?

255
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,551
He's my...

256
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:35,821
Sewing counselor.

257
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:38,762
Makin' sure
she doesn't drop a stitch.

258
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:40,560
He is very thorough.

259
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:43,500
You got nothin' to do?

260
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:46,834
Well, I'll leave you two
to work out your issues.

261
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:50,171
Obviously, there's plenty.

262
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:52,039
You shouldn't let her
talk to you like that.

263
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:53,100
Oh, whatever.

264
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:54,339
You want me
to take care of her?

265
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:55,539
Oh, no, no, no, no.
It's fine.

266
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:57,104
You should...
you should get out of here.

267
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:58,150
You're the boss.

268
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,514
I'm not the boss.

269
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:00,643
Stop saying that.

270
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,880
Go. Shoo.
Bye.

271
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:05,253
If you ask me,
it'd look better as a strapless.

272
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:13,531
It does look better
as a strapless.

273
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:15,931
I hate him.

274
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:24,074
You'd think
a classy place like this.

275
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:25,508
would have a dress code.

276
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,944
...or a limit on the number
of nose rings you can wear.

277
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:29,947
You don't give up, do you?

278
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:31,414
Now you're catchin' up.

279
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:32,542
You hungry?

280
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:38,118
Okay, why did you come.

281
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,590
...all the way to Staten Island
for lunch?

282
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:43,127
I've been comin' here
for over 40 years.

283
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:45,686
Best gnocchi around.

284
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,199
Look, George,
you don't want me, okay?

285
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,529
I know nothing
about what you do.

286
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,796
That doesn't matter.

287
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,599
Family don't turn their back
on each other.

288
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:54,662
Tell that to my grandfather.

289
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,674
You can hate him,
but the fact is...

290
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:57,800
...he was protecting you.

291
00:12:57,877 --> 00:12:59,435
He was keeping you
away from danger.

292
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:02,106
Great.
And what about now?

293
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:03,944
We're so close to being legit.

294
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:05,779
We need someone to take us
the rest of the way.

295
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:07,011
Someone like me?

296
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:09,020
Honest.

297
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:10,055
Smart.

298
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,089
Better.

299
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:12,647
Stop it.
Stop.

300
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:14,625
I'm very susceptible
to compliments right now.

301
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:15,751
Look, don't throw away.

302
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:17,625
...everything that
your grandfather worked for.

303
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:19,789
You can turn his legacy
into something good...

304
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:21,560
...something you can be proud of.

305
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:28,530
My school
means everything to me.

306
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:30,074
I won't leave.
I can't leave.

307
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,131
You don't have to.

308
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,940
And nobody finds out,
nobody.

309
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:35,537
Believe me,
I ain't no squealer.

310
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:36,876
Oh, I hope you're happy...

311
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:38,576
'cause you've given me quite the
headache.

312
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,618
Is that a yes?

313
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:40,709
Yes, it's a yes.
Shh!

314
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:42,344
I'm done talking about this.

315
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:43,888
You're the boss.

316
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:45,355
Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm the boss.

317
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:46,789
I can't even run my own life...

318
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:49,191
...and now I'm supposed
to run your family's.

319
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:50,285
It's just perfect.

320
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:01,929
Jack!

321
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:05,636
Sir.

322
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:07,645
You wanted to see me, sir?

323
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:10,546
I've decided to take you
off suspension, Jack.

324
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:12,709
Okay!

325
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:13,774
Wow.

326
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:14,877
Thank you, sir.

327
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:16,251
I've got
new allergy medication...

328
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:18,085
...so there won't be
any more problems with the...

329
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:20,717
...the nose and the sneezing
and the...

330
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:22,124
...oh, I'm fine, I promise you.

331
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,924
We just received a tip
on the Sarto family.

332
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:26,897
Looks like they found themselves
a new don.

333
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:29,491
Oh, uh, wow.

334
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:32,093
Okay, uh, great.

335
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:38,202
L... I don't understand, sir.

336
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:40,575
A fashion student?

337
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:42,637
I want you to go
inside her school...

338
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,149
...find out what this...
this Brooke Taylor is up to...

339
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,185
...and then bring her down.

340
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:50,620
You mean enroll
in dressmaking classes, sir?

341
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:52,020
Sure, a young man
like yourself.

342
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:53,558
...must know a lot about fashion.

343
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:55,423
Besides, a big bust like this.

344
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:58,054
...could really boost
your career, Jack.

345
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,529
Absolutely, sir...

346
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:02,066
...but isn't there a better way?

347
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:05,763
You know, phone taps
or internet surveillance...

348
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:10,298
...something
that doesn't involve sewing?

349
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:12,401
If you can't do it,
I'll get Carter.

350
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:13,843
He's a real sharp dresser...

351
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,575
...and he's been bugging me awhile
for a big case like this.

352
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:18,617
Sir, I can handle this, okay?

353
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:21,710
I will be the...

354
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:29,956
...most fashionable fashion student
on campus, sir.

355
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:33,692
Would you mind clipping me?

356
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:39,531
Don't screw up, Jack.

357
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:47,209
Hey, workin' on somethin' new?

358
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,405
Uh, no, it's nothing.

359
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,380
So you ready to go?

360
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,576
I don't want to be late
for the fashion quiz.

361
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:54,448
They might deduct a point
from me or something.

362
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,010
Then I'd have no chance to win.

363
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:57,453
You know,
maybe I should stay home.

364
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:58,581
We're a bit nervous.

365
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:00,181
Hey, you studied very hard
for this.

366
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:01,886
It's the fashion finals.
You're going.

367
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,519
You'll be fine.

368
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:04,960
Just don't look
into the audience.

369
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:08,124
with all those eyes
just watching and judging you.

370
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,224
Whew!

371
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,427
Talk about scary.

372
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:12,163
Why'd you have to say
a thing like that?

373
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:13,602
What?
I'm just trying to help you.

374
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:15,071
You guys.

375
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:25,311
Now, next question:

376
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:34,817
Love beads.

377
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:35,951
That is correct!

378
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:45,135
Now, next question.

379
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:49,231
What was unfavorably worn
by little old ladies.

380
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:53,267
...in Florida in the summer
of 1982?

381
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,312
Testing.

382
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,369
Testing.

383
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:57,210
This is Agent Jack Lawton.

384
00:16:57,282 --> 00:17:01,616
...on case number 479358:

385
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,781
The takedown of mob boss
Brooke Taylor.

386
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,347
Bring it, bring it,
bring it, bring it!

387
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:07,414
Hoy!

388
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:09,393
Uhh!

389
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:10,792
Next question.

390
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:11,830
What item...

391
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:14,491
Oh, my God, he's so gorgeous.

392
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:15,692
Too bad he doesn't know my name.

393
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:16,962
So go introduce yourself.

394
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,128
Ask him out.

395
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,170
Me ask him out?

396
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:20,205
No way.

397
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:21,364
Why not?

398
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,067
Because, Page,
girls don't ask guys out.

399
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:24,666
It's weird and desperate.

400
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:26,335
What if he says no?
What if he says yes?

401
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:28,403
B, if you want something
bad enough, you go get it.

402
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,382
I've spotted the subject
with a female accomplice.

403
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:33,782
If you can't, you can't.

404
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:37,379
Okay, fine.
I'll do it.

405
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:39,185
Something is definitely
going down.

406
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:40,885
They are on the move,
and, sir, I am on the...

407
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:42,688
Here we go.

408
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:46,689
Hey, Marcus.

409
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:49,097
You know, you're the one
who should be up there.

410
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:53,730
I mean, you're so brilliant
and smart and everything.

411
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:00,711
Come on.
He's not worth it.

412
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:09,215
Our next category...

413
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:12,018
Hey, Dee,
there's always next year.

414
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:15,925
Can I ask you guys something
about family?

415
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:17,894
Of course, anything.

416
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:20,591
What do you do when
they're not exactly like you?

417
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,224
I know a lot about that one.

418
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:23,734
And how do you deal with it?

419
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:26,362
Any way you can, 'cause,
girl, you stuck with 'em.

420
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,905
That's what I thought.

421
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:30,032
But still,
no matter how freaky.

422
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,872
...or weird they are...

423
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,003
...it's nice to have them around,
like Dee.

424
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:37,243
So what's up, B?

425
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:38,715
Why you askin' about family?

426
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:39,751
It's nothing.

427
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:42,616
Never mind.

428
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:55,223
Movies.

429
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,791
Believe me, nothin' like that.

430
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,269
Oh.

431
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:02,273
Well, except maybe Sal Hugo.

432
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:03,831
Who's Sal Hugo?

433
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:05,308
Old-school mob boss.

434
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:10,076
He's gonna want your territory.

435
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,582
At some point,
you got to meet him.

436
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,845
Me?

437
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,443
You gotta sell him
on our new direction...

438
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:17,011
...gain some respect...

439
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:19,080
...or he'll walk all over us
and ruin our plans.

440
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,489
But how?
I'm not convincing.

441
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,026
Nobody listens to anything
that I say.

442
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:23,652
That's okay.

443
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:24,718
I'll teach you.

444
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:27,892
Ready?
Ready.

445
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:32,795
You see?

446
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:34,532
You gotta own the room...

447
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:35,766
...make everyone notice you.

448
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,502
Oh, I don't want anyone
to notice me.

449
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:38,838
Come on.
Try it.

450
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:44,648
Ready?
Ready.

451
00:19:58,997 --> 00:19:59,986
One more time.

452
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:11,473
You're still not owning.

453
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,033
You're returning
a late library book.

454
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:14,669
Oh, that reminds me.

455
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:15,838
Where you going?

456
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:17,006
Come back!

457
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:19,812
We're not done yet.

458
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:23,878
Watch me.

459
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:33,662
I can't tell
what you're thinking.

460
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:34,858
Xactly.

461
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:37,163
In meetings,
you don't reveal anything.

462
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:40,569
You let them reveal.
Then you'll have the advantage.

463
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:41,970
Try again.

464
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:46,410
You look like you just got
a C on a test.

465
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:47,445
Hey!

466
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:48,536
I'm sorry.
You're right.

467
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:49,581
That would never happen.

468
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:51,047
George, I can't do this.

469
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:52,242
I'm an emotional person.

470
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:53,375
Hello, college girl.

471
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:54,544
We'll try again later.

472
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,850
Fine.

473
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,049
So what about this Sal guy?

474
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:01,786
I sent a man over
to buy us some time...

475
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,725
...see what kind of a mood
he's in.

476
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,034
I had plans!

477
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,969
I waited a long time for this.

478
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:15,632
I am not gonna let
this new boss, Brooke... Brooke?

479
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:17,140
What kind of a name is Brooke?

480
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:19,734
Mr. Hugo, you want me to run
this Sarto guy through again?

481
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:20,778
Huh?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

482
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:22,143
Run him through again.

483
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:24,273
This time, put him through
the rinse cycle, will you?

484
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:25,873
He's makin' a mess
out of my floors here.

485
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:26,940
These people, you know...

486
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:29,112
...they gotta learn
a little respect.

487
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:31,923
I made a joke!

488
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:35,125
That's a good one, boss.

489
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:36,558
Come on.

490
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,358
Hey, you got any quarters?

491
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:42,961
Do you have me now, sir?

492
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:45,936
Yes... No, I plan on
making contact today, sir.

493
00:21:46,004 --> 00:21:47,062
Yes.
No, nothing yet.

494
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,766
I will fill you in
as soon as I know, sir.

495
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,932
Yes.

496
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:53,739
Believe me,
I am trying my hardest, sir.

497
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:11,192
Oh, yes.

498
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:12,491
Hi.

499
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:15,727
They're, uh...
they're tricky little guys.

500
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:17,132
They're impossible to sew with.

501
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:20,171
That's because
it's a seam ripper.

502
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:21,466
Right, yeah.

503
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,235
Just... Just kidding.

504
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:24,502
Do I know you?

505
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:26,168
You look really familiar.

506
00:22:26,244 --> 00:22:27,472
Me?

507
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:29,480
No, I don't think so.

508
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:32,915
Last semester,
floral print design?

509
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:34,042
Scarves and handbags?

510
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:36,314
Oh, ladies' undergarments.

511
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:38,618
Actually, I just
transferred here from...

512
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,681
Shh.
Designer State.

513
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:42,727
Fashion U of the West Coast.

514
00:22:42,794 --> 00:22:44,284
That's a great school.

515
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,796
Yeah, my name's Jack.

516
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:46,853
I'm Brooke.

517
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:47,921
Okay, people!

518
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:49,432
Now it is your turn!

519
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:51,867
So find a partner
and practice marking them.

520
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:53,427
...for a fitting.

521
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:54,995
Let's go!

522
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:57,371
A fitting?
Yeah.

523
00:22:57,442 --> 00:22:59,410
Uh, it's been a while
since I've marked anything...

524
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:01,776
...so maybe you could,
you know, help me.

525
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:04,008
Be my partner,
my little honeysuckle.

526
00:23:04,082 --> 00:23:05,379
...of the garden of love.

527
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:08,819
Okay, comin' along.

528
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,184
Uh-huh.

529
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:12,120
Watch it with the pins
when you get to the inseam.

530
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,589
Mm-hmm.
Keep at the chalk.

531
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:14,989
With the chalk, come on.

532
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,027
Lovely, fine.

533
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:18,062
Mm.
All right, then.

534
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,097
It's funny, really.

535
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:20,188
Actually, this whole time...

536
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:21,664
I never even thought
you knew my name.

537
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:22,757
I don't.

538
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:24,768
Oh, right.

539
00:23:24,836 --> 00:23:27,031
Of course.

540
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:28,299
It's Brooke.

541
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:30,102
It's Brooke,
in case you're wondering.

542
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:32,541
And you're Marcus,
which, you already know that.

543
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:37,244
I'm gonna just keep measuring,
and I'll just shut up.

544
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:38,714
Don't mind me.

545
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:47,553
Okay, now I have to measure
your inseam.

546
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,994
32.
I say it's 32.

547
00:23:57,068 --> 00:23:58,330
Can I ask you something?

548
00:23:58,403 --> 00:23:59,870
Yeah, sure.
Anything.

549
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:02,236
I mean, how does
my butt look in these?

550
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:04,104
I feel so naked
without a mirror in here.

551
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:07,236
Oh.

552
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:08,677
Fine, fine.

553
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:09,736
Only fine?

554
00:24:09,815 --> 00:24:10,782
No, really good.

555
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:12,407
You really fill
these pants out nicely.

556
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:16,079
I mean, they're...
the lines are perfect.

557
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:17,212
Really good.

558
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:20,190
Yeah, well,
I do a lot of squats.

559
00:24:20,258 --> 00:24:22,419
Ah, yeah.

560
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:23,483
Check this out.

561
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:24,529
Ooh!

562
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:26,496
I mean, that is tight, huh?

563
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:27,532
Yeah, yeah.

564
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:31,628
Yeah, it's really tight.

565
00:24:31,703 --> 00:24:34,399
Yeah, my girlfriend
thinks so too.

566
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:39,410
Right.

567
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:42,845
Yes.

568
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:46,984
See me after class.

569
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:48,451
Okay.

570
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,579
They're... They're...
they're caprey...

571
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:54,113
...or capri shorts.

572
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,291
Oh!

573
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:02,628
Come on, Jack.

574
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:05,693
You can hit a fleeing suspect
from 50 yards away.

575
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:09,297
I think you can do this.

576
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:13,003
Come on.

577
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:14,739
Yeah!

578
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:16,371
Okay, you thought
I couldn't thread you...

579
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:17,415
...but I threaded you.

580
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:18,676
How does it feel
to be threaded?

581
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,684
Aah!

582
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:28,422
Is this what you want?

583
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,356
Wait, let me get this right.

584
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:34,455
You had your hand on his butt?

585
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,660
You're missing
the important part of the story.

586
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:38,202
What, that it was nice?

587
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,033
No, that he has a girlfriend.

588
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:41,299
Like I have any chance, anyway.

589
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,362
Don't say that.

590
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,464
Of course you do.

591
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:47,638
Well, did you at least
give it a squeeze?

592
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:49,441
Oh.

593
00:25:49,514 --> 00:25:51,709
Dare to dream, girls.

594
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:53,978
If the board of trustees
thinks I'm gonna live.

595
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,145
with outdated furniture
in the dean's mansion...

596
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,848
...they got another thing coming.

597
00:25:57,923 --> 00:25:59,948
The mansion reflects
on the school...

598
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:01,583
...and I refuse that reflection.

599
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:04,151
...to be anything short
of recherchê.

600
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:07,198
No, that means refined,
you idiot.

601
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:08,289
Ladies.

602
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:10,300
Dean Faber, how's it going?

603
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:12,495
If you girls only knew
what I did around here.

604
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:13,629
Oh, we do!

605
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:16,139
And we appreciate everything.

606
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:17,572
You missed a spot.

607
00:26:17,642 --> 00:26:21,169
Yes, hello.
Is that...

608
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:32,448
Oh, it's a table,
not a trough.

609
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:37,061
So this is everyone, huh?

610
00:26:37,128 --> 00:26:38,390
Kind of scruffy,
don't you think?

611
00:26:38,463 --> 00:26:39,589
Scruffy?

612
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:41,325
Yeah, with
some definite hygiene issues.

613
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,458
Not very polite, either.

614
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:44,866
Believe me...

615
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,597
...that'll come in handy
in their line of work.

616
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:49,263
Come on, say something.

617
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:51,241
What? Me?
No, no, no.

618
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:52,867
No, I didn't prepare
anything to say, no.

619
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,673
These guys don't care.

620
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:56,373
Half of them are deaf
from all the gunfire.

621
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:57,847
No, George,
you don't understand.

622
00:26:57,916 --> 00:26:59,247
I am very bad
at public speaking.

623
00:26:59,317 --> 00:27:01,114
Introduce yourself.

624
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:03,347
Let 'em know
you mean business.

625
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:05,753
Okay.

626
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:09,885
Hello... Everyone.

627
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:10,928
Guys?

628
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:12,588
Listen up.

629
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:17,057
Hello, everyone.

630
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,124
How are you?

631
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,639
I intend to learn
all of your names...

632
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:26,575
'cause, you know,
that's what a good leader does.

633
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:30,775
She gets to know
and gets along with everyone.

634
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:35,309
I heard a famous designer
say that once, yeah.

635
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:37,321
So I have no experience.

636
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:39,789
...in what you guys do...

637
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:41,621
whatever it is that you do...

638
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:44,355
...but I intend to work very hard.

639
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:46,226
People at my school
can vouch for that.

640
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:48,322
Let me tell you...
I mean, the people that know me.

641
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,526
Not a lot of people know me.

642
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:50,659
I'm kind of, you know...

643
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:52,794
I'm not very popular
at my school.

644
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:54,463
They have these, you know,
these cliques.

645
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:55,870
You guys...
you know, cliques.

646
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,635
They just get together,
and I'm telling you...

647
00:27:57,709 --> 00:27:58,801
I just wish we could just.

648
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:00,777
...put all of that aside
and come together.

649
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:08,115
...so we can make beautiful,
yet affordable clothes as one.

650
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:09,778
So are there, like,
any questions?

651
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:13,024
They hate me!

652
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:14,183
They hate everyone.

653
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:15,749
Well, this time,
it was pointed at me...

654
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:17,351
...and it's more than
a little scary, okay?

655
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:19,124
They need to work on that.
It's not healthy.

656
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:21,097
Boss, these guys
may be rough around the edges...

657
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:22,531
Dges?
All they have are edges.

658
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,693
But they know
how to follow orders.

659
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:27,397
So you're saying they have to
listen to everything that I say?

660
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:29,667
Mm-hmm.

661
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:32,369
Verything that I say?

662
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:33,741
Are you sure about this?

663
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:34,779
Oh, yeah.

664
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:36,643
You don't like this one?

665
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:45,349
Talk about extreme makeover.

666
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:46,390
Whoa!

667
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:49,621
Hey!
Hey!

668
00:28:49,694 --> 00:28:50,661
Too much?

669
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,663
Nah, they'll clean up fine.

670
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:53,720
Good.

671
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:58,596
Hey, watch out for the heat!

672
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:15,582
Okay, now,
try to avoid it if you can...

673
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:17,120
...but if there is an accident...

674
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:19,349
...gunpowder can be removed
with a 15-minute soak.

675
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:22,393
...in lukewarm water
with a teaspoon of ammonia.

676
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,087
Okay?

677
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:25,356
Yeah... No!

678
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,227
Oh, this is way too many carbs
for the new look.

679
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:28,265
Here.

680
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:30,358
Try a Slim-Fast bar, okay?

681
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:32,062
It's way better for you.

682
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:34,628
Now, let's talk
general fabric here.

683
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:39,967
I could totally
get used to this.

684
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:42,672
It's like Simon Says,
but with grown-ups.

685
00:29:42,747 --> 00:29:45,511
By the way,
you look very handsome.

686
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:48,552
I forgot how this feels.

687
00:30:20,685 --> 00:30:22,550
It's me.

688
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,053
You're having fun?

689
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:26,215
I love being the boss.

690
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:28,592
Yeow!

691
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:32,991
Oh, wow.

692
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:34,759
You've been busy.
Good.

693
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:35,925
Let's keep it that way.

694
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,991
Yes, Miss Candace.

695
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:39,536
Cheer up.

696
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:42,630
I can't get you into Fashion U
unless I have more of these.

697
00:30:42,707 --> 00:30:47,201
And remember, a happy designer
is a productive designer.

698
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:49,712
And next time, no names.

699
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:51,180
I'll make sure
you get your credit.

700
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:54,650
Trust me.

701
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:08,891
You all look fashion-tabulous.

702
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:15,497
Hmm.

703
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:42,865
Forget about it.

704
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:46,927
Forget about it.

705
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:49,303
Forget about it.

706
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:52,275
Like, totally forget about it.

707
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:53,867
Brooke.

708
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:55,936
What's going on?

709
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:58,175
You talkin' to me?

710
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:01,218
So yeah, I'm a mob boss.

711
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:05,082
Look, you guys,
I wanted to tell you sooner.

712
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:06,680
I was just afraid
of how you would react.

713
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,055
You were right.

714
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:11,459
Whoa, our shy little girl
has become Vito Corleone?

715
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:12,587
Shh.

716
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:14,154
Nobody can know.

717
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:15,460
Imagine the reaction.

718
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:17,694
Trust me; that's the least
of your worries.

719
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,862
Look, it's very safe.

720
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,405
George is protecting me, okay?

721
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:22,496
It's just a part-time thing.

722
00:32:22,573 --> 00:32:23,904
It's like an after-school job.

723
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:26,466
Couldn't you just work
at the mall like everyone else?

724
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:31,208
Look, you guys,
my grandfather spent years.

725
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:32,909
...trying to make
this family legitimate.

726
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:34,645
I just want to be the one
to finish the job.

727
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:38,849
I need my best friends
behind me on this, please.

728
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:40,823
I can't do this alone.

729
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:42,052
I'm sorry, B.

730
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,957
I can't.

731
00:32:44,028 --> 00:32:46,155
I just can't.

732
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,754
Hey, don't look at me.

733
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:49,925
I gave up everything I have
to come here.

734
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:51,332
I can't risk that.

735
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,596
Brooke?

736
00:32:54,672 --> 00:32:55,866
Running the mob?

737
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,931
Yes, it explains everything.

738
00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:02,105
Such as her high grades
or her lack of a social life.

739
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,875
...or even the way she dresses?

740
00:33:03,948 --> 00:33:05,575
Yes, that and... And more.

741
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,880
I haven't got time
for this nonsense, Candace.

742
00:33:07,952 --> 00:33:09,681
I'm in the middle
of a fund-raising campaign.

743
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:13,281
Have you ever tried
to get money out of alumni?

744
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:14,382
Marge?
Yes?

745
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:15,756
Has Tommy Hilfiger
called back?

746
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,522
No, sir, he hasn't.

747
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:19,893
You see?
This is what I'm up against.

748
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:22,091
Shouldn't you at least
look into it?

749
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:24,794
I mean, the school's reputation
is at risk.

750
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:25,995
Dean Faber?

751
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,537
Yes?

752
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:28,765
Is it Vera Wang?

753
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,364
Your decorator's
on line three.

754
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:34,571
He's asking why you've ordered
three of the same armoire.

755
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:36,579
Unless you have proof...

756
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:38,205
I don't want to hear
another word.

757
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:39,544
Fine.

758
00:33:39,617 --> 00:33:41,710
I'll get you proof.

759
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:49,583
Remember, when you meet Sal...

760
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:52,891
...you pause,
quick nod of the head...

761
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:55,398
...then you reach out to shake.

762
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:56,990
Not too soft.

763
00:33:57,068 --> 00:34:00,162
Okay, not too hard, either.

764
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:01,500
That's fine.

765
00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:03,506
And finally,
you lean in to Sal for the kiss.

766
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:05,565
W!
Why do I have to kiss him?

767
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:08,203
A small peck on each cheek.

768
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:09,644
It's a sign of respect.

769
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:12,376
I'll just send him
a fruit basket.

770
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:14,350
Please, Brooke,
you gotta convince Sal.

771
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:16,478
...that you're in command
or we can't go legit.

772
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,351
Our family depends on...

773
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:22,251
This is gonna make
a great pair of socks.

774
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:25,352
Freak.

775
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:27,364
How was that?
Too much?

776
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:29,730
No.
It was different.

777
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:31,894
Oh, wait, let me get that.

778
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:33,596
We can't have a tough guy
like you George.

779
00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:35,696
with lipstick
on your face, right?

780
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:37,707
So we'll continue
with the lessons later then?

781
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:39,037
Okay.

782
00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:45,177
I got that as a kid.

783
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:48,616
It's actually what first got me
interested in fashion.

784
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:49,948
See?

785
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:51,886
We used to have this guy
come to the foster home.

786
00:34:51,956 --> 00:34:53,048
His name was Donny.

787
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:55,456
He was an ex-orphan
or something.

788
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:58,586
Anyway, he gave
all the kids presents...

789
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:02,429
...but he called me
his special angel.

790
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,468
And then one year,
he gave me this for my birthday.

791
00:35:04,535 --> 00:35:06,332
That's nice.

792
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:07,803
I know.
It still works too.

793
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:09,669
Work?
I got to go to work.

794
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,071
Will you give me a ride?

795
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:22,312
Hey.

796
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:23,853
It's... it's you.

797
00:35:23,921 --> 00:35:25,889
Look out, man!

798
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,897
That's tulle from Paris.

799
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,702
Very floaty and feminine.

800
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:44,798
Oh, yeah.

801
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:46,070
I was just...
I was just looking.

802
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:50,171
Can I help you
with something?

803
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:51,909
Brooke Taylor works here,
doesn't she?

804
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,917
Well, why don't you ask her
yourself?

805
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,577
What?

806
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:56,620
Jack, hey.

807
00:35:56,687 --> 00:35:57,745
Hey.

808
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,483
Uh, George,
thank you for the ride.

809
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:02,549
I'll talk to you later.

810
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:04,618
You kids have fun.

811
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:06,026
He's just a friend.

812
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,964
So were you asking about me?

813
00:36:12,036 --> 00:36:13,833
No.

814
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:16,237
L... I mean...

815
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:18,673
I'd heard that you worked here,
and so I, uh...

816
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:20,040
You wanted a deal
on material.

817
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:22,944
Right, yeah.
Yeah, that's it.

818
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:25,278
Anything for a classmate.
Come with me.

819
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:26,338
Oh, okay.

820
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:27,543
Hello?

821
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:30,143
Yeah, could I speak
to a reporter, please?

822
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:32,212
An investigative reporter...

823
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:34,918
...preferably one with a Pulitzer.

824
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:36,186
I'll hold.

825
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,626
We've got some great fabric
back here.

826
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:40,994
Let me show you one I think
you're really gonna like.

827
00:36:41,065 --> 00:36:44,501
It's got amazing texture
and balance, don't you think?

828
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:47,037
Uh, yeah, yeah.

829
00:36:47,104 --> 00:36:49,265
Actually,
it's my own creation.

830
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,568
Really?

831
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:51,972
Yeah, when it's slow
around here...

832
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,408
I like to play around with the
fabric.

833
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:54,944
See, with this one,
I just steamed it.

834
00:36:55,012 --> 00:36:57,378
...and then sewed ruffles
across the grain.

835
00:36:57,448 --> 00:36:58,437
See?

836
00:36:58,516 --> 00:36:59,744
Wow.

837
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:01,808
You... You really know a lot
about this stuff, huh?

838
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,478
Yeah, I should.

839
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:04,646
It's only my life.

840
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:07,885
Yeah.

841
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:12,794
Okay.
So what can I get for you?

842
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:14,353
Right.

843
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:15,922
I don't know.

844
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,900
How about...
how about this one?

845
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:19,869
It's... it's pretty.

846
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:23,737
Yeah, okay.

847
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:25,708
So I really like
this new look of yours.

848
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:26,834
Oh, thanks.

849
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,310
It's more you,
except that tie.

850
00:37:28,379 --> 00:37:31,780
What?
Yeah, here.

851
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:33,942
That was a gift.

852
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:35,952
A little kitschy-retro,
don't you think?

853
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,851
Uh, yeah.

854
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:40,083
That's what I was going for.

855
00:37:40,157 --> 00:37:43,058
I think a bit less dorky
is better.

856
00:37:43,127 --> 00:37:45,288
Oh.
Here, let me.

857
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:53,968
Oh.
There.

858
00:37:57,575 --> 00:37:59,668
Okay, I'll see you in class.
Bye.

859
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:01,803
Okay.

860
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:03,608
This is gonna make
a great suit.

861
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:05,410
Yeah.

862
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,048
You know, Dee, we
should have helped Brooke out.

863
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:15,354
What kind of friends are we?

864
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:16,950
I miss her.

865
00:38:17,028 --> 00:38:19,121
You know, I was just about
to say that.

866
00:38:19,196 --> 00:38:21,528
You always do that.
What?

867
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,658
Take what I have to say
and make it about yourself.

868
00:38:23,734 --> 00:38:26,760
Mm-hmm.
Sounds like someone's jealous.

869
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:37,573
Ow, ah, ah!

870
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:38,774
Jack?

871
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:43,684
Hey, Brooke.

872
00:38:43,754 --> 00:38:46,416
These cups, you know?
There ought to be a law.

873
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,980
Two times in two days.

874
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:49,549
I swear you were following me.

875
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:51,288
Following you?

876
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:53,887
Why... why would I be
following you?

877
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:57,400
Um, no reason, I guess.

878
00:38:57,468 --> 00:39:00,835
But now that I've found you,
maybe I can...

879
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:02,839
I can walk you to class?

880
00:39:02,907 --> 00:39:03,931
Okay.

881
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,475
So you were
a problem child, huh?

882
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:07,704
Oh, yeah, the worst.

883
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:09,507
Like getting arrested
and stuff like that?

884
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,844
No!
Nothing that bad.

885
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:14,146
No, I... I just had this notion.

886
00:39:14,218 --> 00:39:16,618
...that my real family
would come looking for me.

887
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,814
So I never let myself
get too close to anyone.

888
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:20,288
You know,
I acted like a real brat...

889
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,258
...but my family never showed.

890
00:39:22,326 --> 00:39:24,157
Well, until...

891
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:25,320
Until?

892
00:39:25,396 --> 00:39:26,556
Until I came here.

893
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:27,927
This place, it's like my home.

894
00:39:27,998 --> 00:39:29,932
Ah.

895
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,093
You've become emotionally
involved with this Brooke.

896
00:39:32,169 --> 00:39:33,932
No, sir, believe me,
there's been a mistake.

897
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:35,130
She's not what we think she is.

898
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,935
Is that right?
Absolutely, sir.

899
00:39:37,007 --> 00:39:38,998
She's not a mob boss.
There's no way.

900
00:39:39,076 --> 00:39:41,874
Then how do you explain that?

901
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:49,485
What do you got to say
for yourself, Jack?

902
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:51,214
What... Do you...
do you have a quarter?

903
00:39:51,288 --> 00:39:52,653
We should probably get one.

904
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:57,489
What's this?

905
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:59,961
Did Donatella Versace
show up again?

906
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:02,624
There she is.
There she is.

907
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,895
Donna! Donna!

908
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:06,334
Are you selling
your movie rights?

909
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,065
Um, what... what's going on?

910
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:09,663
Is this you?

911
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:13,437
Oh, my...
That is a horrible picture!

912
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:14,637
Hey!

913
00:40:14,712 --> 00:40:16,475
Hey, get away from her!

914
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:40,301
I think we lost them.

915
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:42,999
You guys totally
saved me back there.

916
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:44,597
Friends stick together
no matter what.

917
00:40:44,675 --> 00:40:45,869
And so do family...

918
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,410
'cause that's what
the three of us are.

919
00:40:47,478 --> 00:40:48,843
Oh, we are.

920
00:40:48,913 --> 00:40:50,813
Oh, God,
this can't be happening.

921
00:40:50,881 --> 00:40:53,145
I'm gonna be the most
hated person on campus.

922
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:54,946
Well, at least
they'll be too scared of you.

923
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:56,782
...to do anything about it.

924
00:40:56,854 --> 00:40:58,219
Oh, no, wait.
What?

925
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,917
This means everyone's
gonna know who I am.

926
00:41:00,991 --> 00:41:03,221
Oh, you're right.
That's worse.

927
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,057
I've gone from a nobody
to a somebody.

928
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,118
...in a single morning.

929
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:07,164
I can't breathe!

930
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:09,199
Girl, snap out of it!

931
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:10,528
Oh!
Ow.

932
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:12,125
What?

933
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:13,727
I saw Cher do it in a movie.

934
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:16,534
That's for hysteria,
not an anxiety attack.

935
00:41:16,607 --> 00:41:18,541
Ooh, yo, sorry, B.

936
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:19,871
I have to quit.

937
00:41:19,944 --> 00:41:21,912
I have to tell George
to find another boss fast.

938
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:23,071
Can you do that?

939
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:24,444
I mean, is it that easy?

940
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:25,880
I'm just gonna lay low
for a while.

941
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:28,180
I'm gonna stay away from crowds,
blend in.

942
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:35,448
So much for blending in.

943
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:42,825
Sit down, everybody, please.

944
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:43,832
Hi, Jack.

945
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:45,266
Verybody, sit down now.

946
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:46,860
Come on, children.

947
00:41:46,937 --> 00:41:49,201
Thank you, children.
Thank you. Thank you.

948
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:51,605
I'd like to open by saying.

949
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:54,610
...that I have been tough
on you all semester...

950
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:57,340
...but that's only because
I care as much about your minds.

951
00:41:57,414 --> 00:41:59,905
...as I do about your future.

952
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:05,650
And, Miss Taylor, I'd especially
like to apologize to you.

953
00:42:05,723 --> 00:42:09,215
...for anything that I might
have said about your wardrobe.

954
00:42:09,293 --> 00:42:12,023
It has been most unfair
and cruel of me...

955
00:42:12,096 --> 00:42:15,429
...and I promise you
it will never happen again.

956
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:17,091
So, uh...

957
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:21,900
why don't we just forget
today's pop quiz, eh?

958
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,639
Maybe this boss thing
isn't so bad.

959
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:42,586
You got to tell her
the truth.

960
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:43,627
I can't.

961
00:42:43,694 --> 00:42:45,218
She hates me.

962
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:47,526
...for what I did
by abandoning her like that.

963
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:48,997
She'll forgive you.

964
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:51,660
when she finds out
you're her grandfather.

965
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:54,203
No, we stick to the plan.

966
00:42:54,271 --> 00:42:55,465
It's working.

967
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:58,599
Once she learns the ropes,
takes us legit...

968
00:42:58,676 --> 00:43:01,110
I disappear forever
and remain dead and buried.

969
00:43:01,178 --> 00:43:06,081
Trust me.
It's better that way.

970
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:09,142
Okay, I don't think
Sal's gonna buy it.

971
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:15,357
Hey, boss, I can have
one of the boys do that.

972
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:16,484
No, no, no, no.

973
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,993
No, it helps me relax.

974
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:21,054
When I was a kid working here,
I could do 40 shirts an hour.

975
00:43:21,131 --> 00:43:23,065
Perfect creases,
not a wrinkle in sight.

976
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:27,631
Is that funny?

977
00:43:27,705 --> 00:43:29,673
Did I say something funny?

978
00:43:32,676 --> 00:43:34,644
So what do we do
about this Brooke?

979
00:43:34,712 --> 00:43:36,339
You set up the meeting.

980
00:43:36,413 --> 00:43:39,143
I want to know who I'm dealing
with before I make my move.

981
00:43:39,216 --> 00:43:41,514
Hey, put your hand in here.

982
00:43:41,585 --> 00:43:44,076
Go ahead.
Put your hand in.

983
00:43:44,154 --> 00:43:46,918
Put it in.
Put it in.

984
00:43:48,258 --> 00:43:49,350
Funny?
Is that funny?

985
00:43:49,426 --> 00:43:50,893
That's funny, isn't it?

986
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:51,950
Get out of here.

987
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:02,238
Hey, George.
What's up?

988
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:03,364
It's time.

989
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,340
Can you come back later?

990
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:06,899
It's time.

991
00:44:11,382 --> 00:44:12,906
You really think
I'm ready for this?

992
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:15,508
Listen, Brooke, don't forget
what I've taught you:

993
00:44:15,586 --> 00:44:18,749
Control the room,
shake Sal's hand firmly...

994
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,790
...and then the two kisses
of respect.

995
00:44:22,526 --> 00:44:23,754
Now, remember...

996
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:26,421
Sal does this thing
where he's staring at you.

997
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,055
where he's looking
for weakness.

998
00:44:28,132 --> 00:44:31,192
Just stay calm and show him
that you can handle yourself.

999
00:44:31,268 --> 00:44:33,896
But weakness
is my strongest quality.

1000
00:44:33,971 --> 00:44:35,097
Come on, boss.

1001
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:36,662
You're one of the toughest
people I know.

1002
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:38,367
Tough?
Tough?

1003
00:44:38,442 --> 00:44:40,137
Oh, you are so off base
on this one.

1004
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:42,804
I'm not even close to being...

1005
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,074
...you really think I'm tough?

1006
00:44:44,148 --> 00:44:45,479
You order me around
pretty good.

1007
00:44:45,549 --> 00:44:47,949
Well, you make it
really easy and fun.

1008
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:51,351
I grew up
without a family too...

1009
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:53,754
...so I know.

1010
00:44:53,824 --> 00:44:56,054
You made yourself
into this amazing person.

1011
00:44:56,126 --> 00:44:59,061
with nobody
handing you anything.

1012
00:44:59,129 --> 00:45:00,118
That's tough.

1013
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:01,960
Uh-huh.

1014
00:45:05,335 --> 00:45:07,803
I hope I don't lose any points
for this one.

1015
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:12,433
Nah, but I might.

1016
00:45:14,745 --> 00:45:15,769
You're not coming in?

1017
00:45:15,846 --> 00:45:17,245
I'll be out here waiting.

1018
00:45:17,314 --> 00:45:18,838
Just be yourself.

1019
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:20,508
You'll do fine.

1020
00:45:44,007 --> 00:45:45,338
Here.

1021
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:47,343
Make sure it don't drip
on the rug.

1022
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:49,675
Right, boss.

1023
00:45:52,816 --> 00:45:53,840
What is this?

1024
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:55,282
It's, um...

1025
00:45:55,352 --> 00:45:58,788
...it's very nice to meet you.

1026
00:45:58,856 --> 00:46:01,188
Sit down!

1027
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:05,854
You know, they mentioned
that you was a chick...

1028
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:08,864
...but nobody said nothin'
about you bein' a skirt.

1029
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:14,063
Oh, I'm neither, actually,
Mr. Hugo, sir.

1030
00:46:14,138 --> 00:46:15,366
Come again?

1031
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,202
I'm a girl.

1032
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:19,868
I object to being labeled
as a chick or a skirt.

1033
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:21,001
It's, like, totally sexist.

1034
00:46:21,078 --> 00:46:22,705
You object?

1035
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:31,011
You got moxie.
I'll give you that.

1036
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:33,249
But you don't look like
you could run a sewing circle...

1037
00:46:33,323 --> 00:46:34,517
...much less a family.

1038
00:46:34,591 --> 00:46:35,922
Oh, no, I assure you I can.

1039
00:46:35,993 --> 00:46:36,960
I can fax you my rêsumê.

1040
00:46:37,027 --> 00:46:38,153
I have excellent references.

1041
00:46:38,228 --> 00:46:39,695
Top of my school,
grades, everything.

1042
00:46:39,763 --> 00:46:41,230
Yeah.

1043
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:42,287
Or not.

1044
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:44,129
Listen.

1045
00:46:47,171 --> 00:46:50,402
Now that Dominic is gone,
God rest his soul...

1046
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:53,204
I figure everything that's yours
is now mine.

1047
00:46:53,277 --> 00:46:56,041
Oh, well, I'm sure
we can work out an agreement.

1048
00:46:56,113 --> 00:46:58,047
...that is beneficial
to both of us.

1049
00:46:58,115 --> 00:46:59,480
Oh, I'm sure that we can.

1050
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:02,951
The agreement is that you give
all your businesses to me...

1051
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:05,750
...and I'll let you
continue to live.

1052
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:09,054
...so that you could do your
fashion school thing, you know.

1053
00:47:09,126 --> 00:47:11,856
I assume from that weird
expression and the silence.

1054
00:47:11,929 --> 00:47:13,726
...that that is a yes,
which is good.

1055
00:47:13,797 --> 00:47:15,424
Now, get out of here.
I'm busy.

1056
00:47:18,802 --> 00:47:20,929
Is... is that
an Italian wool suit?

1057
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:22,494
Custom made, the best.

1058
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:23,870
May I?

1059
00:47:25,475 --> 00:47:27,170
Hmm.
What I thought.

1060
00:47:27,244 --> 00:47:30,611
What?
It's a mid-weight.

1061
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:32,444
It's too heavy for you.

1062
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:33,813
Makes you sweat a lot, right?

1063
00:47:37,888 --> 00:47:38,946
You could say that.

1064
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:42,219
Um, a lighter wool,
say a 110...

1065
00:47:42,292 --> 00:47:43,884
would be softer
and breathe better.

1066
00:47:43,961 --> 00:47:45,519
Probably make you
sleep easier at night.

1067
00:47:45,596 --> 00:47:47,325
You know, I get two hours now,
I'm lucky.

1068
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:50,855
Clothes not only make the man,
they shape the man.

1069
00:47:50,934 --> 00:47:53,232
Now, have you ever given any
thought to your color palette?

1070
00:47:53,303 --> 00:47:58,002
I have some swatches
in my purse.

1071
00:47:58,075 --> 00:48:01,238
Well, you know, I always
thought of myself as an autumn.

1072
00:48:01,311 --> 00:48:04,007
Mm, okay, well...

1073
00:48:04,081 --> 00:48:06,276
I have this lovely
brown one...

1074
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:08,215
...and it goes with your...
your manliness...

1075
00:48:08,285 --> 00:48:11,254
...and still a touch
of your feminine side.

1076
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:12,515
My what?

1077
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:14,850
I did it.
I did it.

1078
00:48:14,925 --> 00:48:15,983
I think I turned him around.

1079
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:17,026
I knew you would.

1080
00:48:17,094 --> 00:48:18,220
It was easier than I thought.

1081
00:48:18,295 --> 00:48:19,887
I mean, it was scary,
but it was still easy.

1082
00:48:19,963 --> 00:48:20,952
You're the boss.

1083
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:21,998
That's right.
Let's go.

1084
00:48:29,172 --> 00:48:31,072
Round up the guys.

1085
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:33,905
This is gonna be easier
than I thought.

1086
00:48:45,522 --> 00:48:47,683
You guys remember that girl
that hates me for no reason?

1087
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:49,385
The one that spilled
butterscotch pudding.

1088
00:48:49,459 --> 00:48:50,426
...on you at dinner?

1089
00:48:50,494 --> 00:48:51,893
Mm-hmm.

1090
00:48:51,962 --> 00:48:54,226
Well, today she held
the door open for me.

1091
00:48:54,298 --> 00:48:55,265
I'm serious.

1092
00:48:55,332 --> 00:48:56,731
I was ten feet away,
and she waited.

1093
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,893
And it wasn't like there was
anyone else around either.

1094
00:48:58,969 --> 00:49:00,766
Just me: Liza!

1095
00:49:00,837 --> 00:49:03,237
Did you guys ever think
we would become this popular?

1096
00:49:11,315 --> 00:49:13,180
Hey, boss girl.

1097
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:15,480
See you brought a couple
of your goons to the party.

1098
00:49:15,552 --> 00:49:19,010
You're only, like, the fifth
Stella McCartney here tonight.

1099
00:49:19,089 --> 00:49:21,683
And I don't wanna guess
who you're supposed to be.

1100
00:49:21,758 --> 00:49:23,020
What about you, Candace?

1101
00:49:23,093 --> 00:49:25,061
What great designer did you
choose to wear tonight?

1102
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:26,322
Me, of course.

1103
00:49:26,396 --> 00:49:27,363
Who else?

1104
00:49:30,767 --> 00:49:32,598
Come on, ladies.

1105
00:49:32,669 --> 00:49:35,069
Heat's all over me
on this one, Jack...

1106
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:37,766
...so I'm here to make sure
you do your job.

1107
00:49:37,841 --> 00:49:39,672
Well, I am trying to, sir...

1108
00:49:39,743 --> 00:49:41,711
...but I just think I need
a little bit more...

1109
00:49:41,778 --> 00:49:44,440
No, no, no.
You're not digging hard enough.

1110
00:49:44,514 --> 00:49:47,347
Now, I want you to stay on her
and stay on her close.

1111
00:49:47,417 --> 00:49:50,818
...until we can get some evidence
that we can use.

1112
00:49:50,887 --> 00:49:53,355
Now, look
at this beautiful baby.

1113
00:49:53,423 --> 00:49:54,447
What's that?

1114
00:49:54,524 --> 00:49:55,650
New surveillance bug.

1115
00:49:55,726 --> 00:49:59,560
Got a camera and microphone
built right in.

1116
00:49:59,629 --> 00:50:02,189
That's a... An earring, sir?

1117
00:50:02,265 --> 00:50:05,291
It's not...
not really my style.

1118
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:09,931
Would you rather wear
these camera glasses?

1119
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:11,372
I'll take the earring.

1120
00:50:11,441 --> 00:50:13,432
Smart choice.

1121
00:50:15,312 --> 00:50:17,507
Sir, this is...
this is not a clip-on.

1122
00:50:17,581 --> 00:50:19,947
I'd have to get my ears pierced
to wear this, so...

1123
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:24,010
Time to take one
for the bureau, son.

1124
00:50:24,087 --> 00:50:25,076
No.

1125
00:50:25,155 --> 00:50:26,486
Sir, you can't.
What are you doing?

1126
00:50:26,556 --> 00:50:27,488
Sir, n... Aah!

1127
00:50:27,557 --> 00:50:30,617
Ow!

1128
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:34,027
Ah.

1129
00:50:34,097 --> 00:50:35,792
Ah!

1130
00:50:42,272 --> 00:50:44,866
You look nice, Brooke.

1131
00:50:50,747 --> 00:50:52,510
Hey, look at you.

1132
00:50:52,582 --> 00:50:53,640
You've got an earring.

1133
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:54,979
Yeah, yeah.

1134
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:56,747
It still hurts.

1135
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:58,549
Just when I think I know you.

1136
00:50:58,622 --> 00:51:00,556
Yeah, well, I guess
you can't really know anyone.

1137
00:51:00,624 --> 00:51:03,855
We all have our secrets.

1138
00:51:03,927 --> 00:51:06,487
Whoa, lighten up, Jack.
It's a party.

1139
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:09,760
I'm sorry.
I'm having a really bad day.

1140
00:51:09,833 --> 00:51:10,959
Do you want to talk about it?

1141
00:51:11,034 --> 00:51:13,195
Yeah.
Yeah, that'd be good.

1142
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:15,170
Do you mind if we go
somewhere else?

1143
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:17,934
The sound is really loud
in here.

1144
00:51:18,008 --> 00:51:19,703
Yes, that's my boy!

1145
00:51:19,776 --> 00:51:22,472
Way to bring it around, Jack.

1146
00:51:22,546 --> 00:51:24,013
Okay.

1147
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:25,173
Hey, Brooke.

1148
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:26,738
Want to dance?

1149
00:51:26,817 --> 00:51:27,977
You want me
to dance with you?

1150
00:51:28,051 --> 00:51:29,348
Come on.

1151
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:34,322
I paid the DJ to play
a slow song next.

1152
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:38,719
Don't let that pretty boy
take the girl!

1153
00:51:51,074 --> 00:51:57,536
So you, uh, notice anything?

1154
00:51:57,614 --> 00:52:01,345
Uh, just that my heart
is beating very fast.

1155
00:52:01,418 --> 00:52:04,114
Um, I'm wearing the pants
you made in class.

1156
00:52:04,187 --> 00:52:05,211
Oh.

1157
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:08,485
So does my butt
still look good?

1158
00:52:08,558 --> 00:52:11,391
You might want to ask
your girlfriend that.

1159
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:12,758
Girlfriend?
Pffff.

1160
00:52:12,829 --> 00:52:15,764
We broke up days ago.

1161
00:52:15,832 --> 00:52:22,396
No, I'm a... Free man.

1162
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:23,962
What happened?
Why'd you leave?

1163
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,065
Well, she's with
the male model.

1164
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:28,111
Nothing was gonna happen
tonight, anyway.

1165
00:52:28,178 --> 00:52:30,544
Oh, Jack,
can't you do anything right?

1166
00:52:30,614 --> 00:52:32,673
Lt... it's pitiful
the way you let that guy.

1167
00:52:32,749 --> 00:52:34,876
...take your girl like that.

1168
00:52:34,951 --> 00:52:38,045
Oh, man.

1169
00:52:38,121 --> 00:52:39,588
Ah.

1170
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:40,918
You wimp.

1171
00:52:48,131 --> 00:52:50,361
So look, I was wondering...

1172
00:52:50,433 --> 00:52:52,094
would you like to go
on a date with me?

1173
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:53,693
Oh, I love dates!

1174
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:54,737
I love raisins.

1175
00:52:54,804 --> 00:52:56,135
I love all that stuff.

1176
00:52:56,206 --> 00:52:58,299
They get the worst rap,
but, mmm, they're delicious.

1177
00:52:58,375 --> 00:53:01,139
No, go on a date.

1178
00:53:01,211 --> 00:53:02,200
What?

1179
00:53:02,279 --> 00:53:05,771
I said go on a date with me!

1180
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:13,221
Okay, I'll go on a date
with you.

1181
00:53:20,797 --> 00:53:22,492
I don't like this guy.

1182
00:53:22,566 --> 00:53:23,624
George...

1183
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,258
I've tried to tell her.

1184
00:53:25,335 --> 00:53:26,893
He's into you
for the wrong reasons.

1185
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:28,028
I can tell.

1186
00:53:28,104 --> 00:53:29,571
Stop trying to act
like my parent.

1187
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:31,869
Sweetie, why don't you wear
the silk blouse you designed?

1188
00:53:31,942 --> 00:53:32,909
No, I can't.

1189
00:53:32,976 --> 00:53:34,170
I messed the stitching up
on it.

1190
00:53:34,244 --> 00:53:35,711
Besides, it's way too amateur.

1191
00:53:35,779 --> 00:53:37,110
What are you talking about?

1192
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:38,147
It's beautiful.

1193
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:40,115
She always does this.

1194
00:53:40,183 --> 00:53:42,913
George, look at these.

1195
00:53:42,986 --> 00:53:46,717
Do these look amateur to you?

1196
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:47,779
They're exquisite.

1197
00:53:47,857 --> 00:53:49,085
See?

1198
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:50,786
No offense, George...

1199
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:52,452
...but you know nothing
about fashion.

1200
00:53:53,863 --> 00:53:55,922
Hello?

1201
00:53:55,999 --> 00:53:57,432
Okay.

1202
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:58,865
He's here.

1203
00:53:58,935 --> 00:54:00,402
Gosh, I'm so nervous.

1204
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:01,459
Tell me I look okay.

1205
00:54:01,538 --> 00:54:02,527
You look beautiful.

1206
00:54:02,606 --> 00:54:03,766
You look great.

1207
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,171
Okay, let's go.

1208
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:07,608
Okay, let him pay for dinner,
and laugh at all his jokes.

1209
00:54:07,677 --> 00:54:09,042
Okay.
Specially the dumb ones.

1210
00:54:09,112 --> 00:54:10,477
All right, got it.

1211
00:54:10,547 --> 00:54:11,514
Good night, George.

1212
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:13,208
Bye.

1213
00:54:13,283 --> 00:54:15,148
Bye.

1214
00:54:15,218 --> 00:54:16,344
Yeah!
Yes.

1215
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:17,716
I still don't like this guy.

1216
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:28,663
Are you sure you wanted
to come here?

1217
00:54:28,732 --> 00:54:30,290
Oh, yeah.
I've read about this place.

1218
00:54:30,367 --> 00:54:32,130
Yes?
May I help you?

1219
00:54:32,202 --> 00:54:33,464
Table for two.

1220
00:54:33,536 --> 00:54:34,525
Sarto.

1221
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:36,333
Welcome.

1222
00:54:36,406 --> 00:54:38,374
Welcome!

1223
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:39,499
Hi.

1224
00:54:39,576 --> 00:54:41,942
It is my family's
deepest honor.

1225
00:54:42,012 --> 00:54:42,979
...having you here tonight.

1226
00:54:43,046 --> 00:54:45,344
Please, come with me.

1227
00:54:45,415 --> 00:54:47,849
I have the most perfect table
for you.

1228
00:54:55,759 --> 00:54:58,990
One moment while we clear
the table for you, huh?

1229
00:54:59,062 --> 00:55:02,031
Let me offer you something
while you're waiting.

1230
00:55:02,098 --> 00:55:03,725
Thank you.

1231
00:55:11,107 --> 00:55:12,734
Whoa!

1232
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:20,249
Would you... would you like
some water, Don...

1233
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:21,375
Miss Don... Miss Donna?

1234
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:22,611
Don's daughter?

1235
00:55:32,629 --> 00:55:33,926
It's all set.

1236
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:35,430
This way, please.

1237
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:41,069
The head chef himself
will be out shortly.

1238
00:55:41,137 --> 00:55:42,661
...to explain the specials.

1239
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:45,333
...and to make
some lovely recommendations.

1240
00:55:45,408 --> 00:55:49,071
Please, order anything you like,
anything at all.

1241
00:55:49,145 --> 00:55:50,373
It's on the house.

1242
00:55:50,447 --> 00:55:52,176
Your money is no good here.

1243
00:55:52,248 --> 00:55:53,272
Yours we'll take.

1244
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:54,715
Njoy.

1245
00:55:54,784 --> 00:55:56,615
Must be ladies' night.

1246
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:59,416
Maybe it's because
you're a lady and it's night.

1247
00:56:09,132 --> 00:56:11,726
Yeah, there's just so many
talented people on campus.

1248
00:56:11,801 --> 00:56:13,200
Sometimes when I think about it...

1249
00:56:13,269 --> 00:56:14,736
...it's a little intimidating,
you know?

1250
00:56:14,804 --> 00:56:16,203
Yeah.

1251
00:56:16,272 --> 00:56:17,762
But I'm not gonna
let that stop me.

1252
00:56:17,841 --> 00:56:19,900
No way.

1253
00:56:19,976 --> 00:56:25,414
Is that Joey Blow Pops
over there?

1254
00:56:25,482 --> 00:56:26,915
Oh, I don't really know.

1255
00:56:26,983 --> 00:56:29,247
He likes to chew gum
when he's bumpin' people off.

1256
00:56:29,319 --> 00:56:30,581
Always goes with peppermint.

1257
00:56:32,689 --> 00:56:34,987
So, Marcus, what about you?

1258
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:36,992
Is modeling something
you want to do long-term...

1259
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:39,528
...or is there...

1260
00:56:39,596 --> 00:56:40,563
No, I don't know.

1261
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:41,756
Maybe, I guess.

1262
00:56:41,831 --> 00:56:43,321
So look, when people
don't pay you back...

1263
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,628
...do you really break their legs?

1264
00:56:44,701 --> 00:56:46,635
Huh, send them down the river,
canary in the mouth...

1265
00:56:46,703 --> 00:56:48,637
...horse's head in the bed?

1266
00:56:48,705 --> 00:56:50,297
Do you believe this guy?

1267
00:56:50,373 --> 00:56:52,034
He's using her.

1268
00:56:52,108 --> 00:56:53,132
A beautiful girl like that...

1269
00:56:53,209 --> 00:56:54,608
...and all he cares about
is gangsters?

1270
00:56:54,677 --> 00:56:56,668
Jack, let's stay
professional.

1271
00:56:56,746 --> 00:57:00,045
Well, Marcus,
I don't know what you've heard...

1272
00:57:00,116 --> 00:57:01,276
...but we don't do that.

1273
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:02,841
Oh, come on.
I'm not scared.

1274
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:05,752
I want to know
all the gory details, really.

1275
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:09,119
Is this why
you asked me out on a date?

1276
00:57:09,192 --> 00:57:10,386
Well, yeah.

1277
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:13,020
I mean, dating a Godfather...

1278
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:14,063
...how cool is that?

1279
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:16,462
Verybody's talkin'.

1280
00:57:18,034 --> 00:57:19,001
Ugh!

1281
00:57:19,068 --> 00:57:20,262
This guy is too much.

1282
00:57:20,336 --> 00:57:23,772
You're not even
that good-looking, pal!

1283
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,569
Oh, that's real professional.

1284
00:57:25,642 --> 00:57:28,907
That's Kneecaps Swanney.

1285
00:57:28,978 --> 00:57:31,879
Oh, and he's coming this way.

1286
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:34,917
Yo, Kneecaps,
can I get a picture?

1287
00:57:34,984 --> 00:57:36,246
I'm just a big fan, man.

1288
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:37,843
I know all your hits.

1289
00:57:37,921 --> 00:57:39,855
Say,"bullets."
Lt'd be hilarious.

1290
00:57:39,923 --> 00:57:43,290
Bullets.

1291
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:44,326
Did you take it?

1292
00:57:44,394 --> 00:57:46,624
I didn't see a flash.

1293
00:57:46,696 --> 00:57:48,926
You know what?

1294
00:57:48,998 --> 00:57:51,193
Next time you want to spend
an evening with a mobster...

1295
00:57:51,267 --> 00:57:53,201
...rent a movie.

1296
00:57:53,269 --> 00:57:55,032
Um, signorina,
is there something wrong?

1297
00:57:55,104 --> 00:57:57,163
Yes, tell my date
never to talk to me again.

1298
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:58,332
My pleasure.

1299
00:58:01,578 --> 00:58:02,567
All right, let's go.

1300
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:04,374
Come with us.
What?

1301
00:58:04,447 --> 00:58:05,778
Can I get my camera?

1302
00:58:11,454 --> 00:58:12,921
Girl, what did you think
you guys did...

1303
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:14,718
...steal Girl Scout cookies?

1304
00:58:14,791 --> 00:58:16,156
I don't know.
I tried not to.

1305
00:58:16,226 --> 00:58:17,955
Well, maybe you should.

1306
00:58:18,027 --> 00:58:19,460
The Mafia does
a lot of bad things.

1307
00:58:19,529 --> 00:58:20,757
Not us.

1308
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:23,264
Oh, you're the friendly
and nice mobsters.

1309
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,301
You know,
you guys really aren't helping.

1310
00:58:25,368 --> 00:58:26,630
Look, all we're trying
to say is...

1311
00:58:26,703 --> 00:58:28,568
...how much do you really know
about your grandfather.

1312
00:58:28,638 --> 00:58:29,935
...and the businesses he ran?

1313
00:58:31,574 --> 00:58:34,702
He was dragged into it
by his father...

1314
00:58:34,777 --> 00:58:37,075
...never given a choice.

1315
00:58:37,146 --> 00:58:39,774
Believe me,
your grandfather was no killer.

1316
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:41,544
He was a good man
doing his best to survive.

1317
00:58:41,618 --> 00:58:43,483
...and provide for his family.

1318
00:58:43,553 --> 00:58:45,851
And my parents,
were they involved?

1319
00:58:45,922 --> 00:58:48,117
No, he kept them out.

1320
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:50,887
...like he kept you out
'cause he loved you.

1321
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:53,861
He wanted you to have
a chance at a normal life...

1322
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:54,919
...and you can still have that.

1323
00:58:54,998 --> 00:58:55,965
How?

1324
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:57,294
Right there in the books.

1325
00:58:57,367 --> 00:59:00,859
Yeah, but waste management,
concrete, scrap metal.

1326
00:59:00,937 --> 00:59:03,906
What do I know
about that stuff?

1327
00:59:03,973 --> 00:59:05,440
Dress factory?

1328
00:59:05,508 --> 00:59:07,032
What's that?

1329
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:08,475
I'll show you.

1330
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:30,828
We run a sweatshop?

1331
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:31,958
These are skilled workers.

1332
00:59:32,035 --> 00:59:34,970
...making a decent wage
with insurance.

1333
00:59:36,339 --> 00:59:39,638
Hey, what are these?

1334
00:59:39,709 --> 00:59:41,802
Those are mine.

1335
00:59:41,878 --> 00:59:43,539
I did them on my break.

1336
00:59:43,613 --> 00:59:44,705
They're beautiful.

1337
00:59:44,781 --> 00:59:46,146
You have
a very distinctive style.

1338
00:59:46,215 --> 00:59:48,240
Thank you.

1339
00:59:49,986 --> 00:59:52,750
Oh, the mother lode!

1340
00:59:52,822 --> 00:59:54,050
Check it out.

1341
00:59:54,123 --> 00:59:55,249
Oh, my gosh.

1342
00:59:55,325 --> 00:59:57,156
We got Prada and Fendi
and Gucci.

1343
00:59:57,226 --> 00:59:58,818
Oh, my!

1344
00:59:58,895 --> 01:00:00,419
Don't tell her,
but they're fake.

1345
01:00:03,032 --> 01:00:05,432
I think
I got designer brain freeze.

1346
01:00:05,501 --> 01:00:06,900
Okay, I'm fine.

1347
01:00:06,970 --> 01:00:09,131
You're trying to tell me
we sell knockoffs?

1348
01:00:09,205 --> 01:00:10,570
'Cause that's all we know
how to do.

1349
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,733
Why didn't you tell me
about this before?

1350
01:00:12,809 --> 01:00:14,606
Look at this, girl!

1351
01:00:14,677 --> 01:00:15,644
Girl, look at this.

1352
01:00:15,712 --> 01:00:16,679
This is beautiful.

1353
01:00:16,746 --> 01:00:18,577
Oh, my gosh!

1354
01:00:18,648 --> 01:00:19,945
Oh, my goodness!

1355
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:26,618
This was
your grandfather's office.

1356
01:00:26,689 --> 01:00:28,316
He made clothes?

1357
01:00:28,391 --> 01:00:29,983
First job he ever had...

1358
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:32,254
...helping the wiseguys
in the neighborhood look sharp.

1359
01:00:32,328 --> 01:00:34,159
I have fashion in my blood.

1360
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:35,822
You have designer genes.

1361
01:00:35,898 --> 01:00:36,865
I knew it.

1362
01:00:36,933 --> 01:00:39,527
Sarto means"tailor"
in Italian.

1363
01:00:39,602 --> 01:00:40,967
That's how you got
your last name.

1364
01:00:41,037 --> 01:00:42,231
Here you are, sir.

1365
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:43,795
Oh, great.
Thanks, Rosa.

1366
01:00:43,873 --> 01:00:45,465
What's that?
Present.

1367
01:00:45,541 --> 01:00:48,135
Oh, sorry.
I don't wear fake clothes.

1368
01:00:48,211 --> 01:00:49,701
It's not fake.

1369
01:00:49,779 --> 01:00:52,304
It's a genuine Brooke Taylor.

1370
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:55,914
My dress!

1371
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:57,919
You asked how you can help us
become legit?

1372
01:00:57,987 --> 01:00:59,011
That's how.

1373
01:00:59,088 --> 01:01:00,350
Oh, my God!

1374
01:01:00,423 --> 01:01:01,720
I'm so good!

1375
01:01:01,791 --> 01:01:02,758
I knew it all along.

1376
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:03,792
No, really.

1377
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:05,521
I'm, like, really good.

1378
01:01:05,595 --> 01:01:08,894
Right.

1379
01:01:10,199 --> 01:01:11,166
You see that?

1380
01:01:11,234 --> 01:01:12,201
What?

1381
01:01:12,268 --> 01:01:13,997
Veryone's looking at you.

1382
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:15,799
Pretty cool, isn't it?

1383
01:01:15,872 --> 01:01:17,533
It's the office again.

1384
01:01:17,607 --> 01:01:18,699
Should I be worried?

1385
01:01:18,775 --> 01:01:20,265
Yeah, I got the same call.

1386
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:22,106
Dean Faber must be needing money
all of a sudden.

1387
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:23,839
I heard him say
he was raising tuition.

1388
01:01:23,913 --> 01:01:25,312
Oh, well.
I'll see you guys later.

1389
01:01:25,381 --> 01:01:26,507
All: Bye!

1390
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:28,617
Jack?

1391
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:30,949
Jack!

1392
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:31,987
Hi!

1393
01:01:32,055 --> 01:01:34,148
Oh, hey, Brooke.

1394
01:01:34,223 --> 01:01:35,656
Wow, look at you.

1395
01:01:35,725 --> 01:01:36,749
I know.

1396
01:01:36,826 --> 01:01:38,225
It's a little dressy
for class but...

1397
01:01:38,294 --> 01:01:39,727
No, you look incredible.

1398
01:01:39,796 --> 01:01:42,162
You look like you just
stepped out of a French issue.

1399
01:01:42,231 --> 01:01:43,664
...of Vogue magazine.

1400
01:01:43,733 --> 01:01:47,100
That is the sweetest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

1401
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:48,762
Jack!

1402
01:01:48,838 --> 01:01:50,100
Get out of here!

1403
01:01:50,173 --> 01:01:51,834
Are you a janitor here?

1404
01:01:51,908 --> 01:01:53,671
Jack!

1405
01:01:53,743 --> 01:01:56,303
I think that is so great,
working your way through school.

1406
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:57,346
Yeah, right, work.

1407
01:01:57,413 --> 01:01:58,402
Jack!

1408
01:01:58,481 --> 01:01:59,607
I'll be with you
in a second!

1409
01:02:02,151 --> 01:02:03,846
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

1410
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,444
Yeah, okay.

1411
01:02:05,521 --> 01:02:07,113
Okay.

1412
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:11,217
So tomorrow in the quad,
there's this sewing rally thing.

1413
01:02:11,294 --> 01:02:13,387
Yes, last team rally
before the sew-off.

1414
01:02:13,463 --> 01:02:14,953
I never miss it.

1415
01:02:15,031 --> 01:02:17,158
Right, and I was thinking,
you know...

1416
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:19,531
...since you're going,
which you are...

1417
01:02:19,602 --> 01:02:22,298
...and if I'm going,
which I am...

1418
01:02:22,371 --> 01:02:25,135
...then maybe we could, uh,
you know...

1419
01:02:26,976 --> 01:02:29,945
You're gonna make me
finish this, aren't you?

1420
01:02:30,012 --> 01:02:31,309
Go together.

1421
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:33,541
You mean like a date?

1422
01:02:33,616 --> 01:02:36,517
Well, it sounds kind of corny
when you say it like that.

1423
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:37,883
Oh, sorry.

1424
01:02:37,954 --> 01:02:39,478
It'd be better
if you just sort of said...

1425
01:02:39,555 --> 01:02:41,147
"Yeah, I'd love to go."

1426
01:02:41,224 --> 01:02:42,816
I mean, if that's
how you're feeling.

1427
01:02:42,892 --> 01:02:45,224
Then, yeah, I'd love to.

1428
01:02:45,294 --> 01:02:47,057
Great.

1429
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:48,392
So it's a date.

1430
01:02:48,464 --> 01:02:50,432
I can't wait.

1431
01:02:54,637 --> 01:02:55,626
I'll see you tomorrow.

1432
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:03,575
So how did it go?

1433
01:03:03,646 --> 01:03:06,206
Sir, for the record,
I do not think this is right.

1434
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:07,408
What are you talking about?

1435
01:03:07,483 --> 01:03:08,677
It's working.
She said yes.

1436
01:03:08,751 --> 01:03:09,945
Yes, I know, but...

1437
01:03:10,019 --> 01:03:12,283
Do I have to remind you
about your job, Jack?

1438
01:03:12,355 --> 01:03:15,085
And that your career
is on the line with this case?

1439
01:03:15,158 --> 01:03:16,386
No, but, sir...

1440
01:03:16,459 --> 01:03:18,723
She is the linchpin we need
to bring down.

1441
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:20,820
...all organized crime
in this city.

1442
01:03:20,897 --> 01:03:21,864
You want that, don't ya?

1443
01:03:21,931 --> 01:03:23,091
Of course.

1444
01:03:23,166 --> 01:03:26,101
Well, then keep putting
on that charm, boy...

1445
01:03:26,169 --> 01:03:29,400
'cause all that romantic
sweet talk's gonna help us.

1446
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:31,531
...bag that fashion crime queen.

1447
01:03:35,778 --> 01:03:36,836
I'm sorry.

1448
01:03:36,913 --> 01:03:37,971
This ain't right.

1449
01:03:38,047 --> 01:03:39,605
She doesn't need me
anymore, Frank.

1450
01:03:39,682 --> 01:03:41,809
That ain't true.

1451
01:03:41,884 --> 01:03:43,112
I want you to keep
an eye on her.

1452
01:03:43,186 --> 01:03:45,120
Make sure she gets
anything she needs.

1453
01:03:45,188 --> 01:03:46,212
Okay?
Anything.

1454
01:03:46,289 --> 01:03:47,347
George!

1455
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:54,160
You're never gonna believe
what happened today.

1456
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:55,629
What's this?
You going on vacation?

1457
01:03:55,698 --> 01:03:59,156
Brooke, I wanted to talk
to you about it.

1458
01:03:59,235 --> 01:04:00,532
I got a date tomorrow.

1459
01:04:00,603 --> 01:04:02,696
I'm sorry, I couldn't wait.
It's with Jack.

1460
01:04:02,772 --> 01:04:04,171
That's great.
I'm happy for you.

1461
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:06,174
I know; I wanted to go get
coffee and talk about it.

1462
01:04:06,242 --> 01:04:07,436
I'm so excited.

1463
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:09,034
I don't know
if I'm gonna sleep tonight.

1464
01:04:09,111 --> 01:04:11,375
But if you're going somewhere...

1465
01:04:11,447 --> 01:04:14,041
...you needed
to tell me something?

1466
01:04:14,116 --> 01:04:17,210
I, uh...

1467
01:04:17,286 --> 01:04:18,878
I was going to throw away
these suitcases.

1468
01:04:18,955 --> 01:04:20,354
...and wanted to know
if you needed 'em.

1469
01:04:20,423 --> 01:04:22,891
Oh, okay.

1470
01:04:22,959 --> 01:04:23,948
Well, can we do it later?

1471
01:04:24,026 --> 01:04:25,288
I'm just so glad you're home.

1472
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:27,522
It's so great to know
I can come here any time...

1473
01:04:27,597 --> 01:04:29,064
...and you'll always be here, isn't
it?

1474
01:04:29,131 --> 01:04:30,428
Yeah, it is.

1475
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:37,267
If you got
any more together, Brooke...

1476
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:38,830
I'd have to start hating you.

1477
01:04:38,908 --> 01:04:40,341
That is so sweet.

1478
01:04:40,409 --> 01:04:42,639
So does this Jack know
about what you're doing?

1479
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:45,010
No, we haven't really
talked about that.

1480
01:04:45,081 --> 01:04:46,446
He must.
It's all over the school.

1481
01:04:46,515 --> 01:04:48,107
You don't think
he's like Marcus, do you?

1482
01:04:48,184 --> 01:04:49,651
No, you would've caught on
by now.

1483
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:52,017
But you need to talk about it,
explain it to him.

1484
01:04:52,088 --> 01:04:54,522
Otherwise all he's got
to go on is vicious rumors.

1485
01:04:54,590 --> 01:04:55,682
Ladies.

1486
01:04:55,758 --> 01:04:57,055
And speaking of vicious.

1487
01:04:57,126 --> 01:04:59,253
Great news.
You're being expelled?

1488
01:04:59,328 --> 01:05:03,264
I got straight As on all
of my latest dresses here.

1489
01:05:03,332 --> 01:05:06,028
Check 'em out.
Beauty and brains.

1490
01:05:06,102 --> 01:05:09,765
I am indeed the full package
come to life.

1491
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:12,899
I swear, one day,
she is gonna get hers.

1492
01:05:12,975 --> 01:05:14,670
She cheated.

1493
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:15,802
What?
What?

1494
01:05:15,878 --> 01:05:17,209
She didn't design
those dresses.

1495
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:19,145
I knew it!

1496
01:05:19,215 --> 01:05:20,204
She's a big phony.

1497
01:05:20,283 --> 01:05:22,478
Wait.
Then who did?

1498
01:05:22,551 --> 01:05:23,745
It wasn't my fault.
I swear.

1499
01:05:23,819 --> 01:05:26,014
Oh, no, Rosa.
We know it's not your fault.

1500
01:05:26,088 --> 01:05:28,556
Just... why don't you tell us
what happened?

1501
01:05:28,624 --> 01:05:30,114
My mother works
for her family...

1502
01:05:30,192 --> 01:05:31,659
...cleaning and taking care of the
house.

1503
01:05:31,727 --> 01:05:33,126
That's how I met Candace.

1504
01:05:33,195 --> 01:05:34,423
When she saw my drawings...

1505
01:05:34,497 --> 01:05:36,522
...she said she'd help me
get into the university.

1506
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:39,261
But instead
she's been ripping you off?

1507
01:05:39,335 --> 01:05:40,427
I can't say anything...

1508
01:05:40,503 --> 01:05:42,266
...or maybe my mom,
she loses her job.

1509
01:05:42,338 --> 01:05:43,464
Well, we got to tell
the dean.

1510
01:05:43,539 --> 01:05:45,006
Yeah, we'll tell him
Monday morning.

1511
01:05:45,074 --> 01:05:46,871
We just need to gather
all the evidence.

1512
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:48,604
We're gonna need
all your drawings, okay?

1513
01:05:48,678 --> 01:05:49,736
Don't worry, Rosa.

1514
01:05:49,812 --> 01:05:52,007
Candace
won't get away with this.

1515
01:05:54,050 --> 01:05:56,848
No, sir.
I'm sure we mailed it.

1516
01:05:56,919 --> 01:05:58,181
Foreclosure?

1517
01:05:58,254 --> 01:06:00,381
Now, why do you have to go
and use a word like that?

1518
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:01,514
Hello, Dean.

1519
01:06:01,590 --> 01:06:02,716
Let me call you back.

1520
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:04,157
What's the matter?

1521
01:06:04,226 --> 01:06:06,251
You havin' a little trouble
with the bank there, huh?

1522
01:06:06,329 --> 01:06:08,388
Sal, what are you doing here?

1523
01:06:08,464 --> 01:06:10,398
You've been
a bad boy again, huh?

1524
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:12,593
Stealing money
from the school, right?

1525
01:06:12,668 --> 01:06:14,431
I told you, it's not for me.

1526
01:06:14,503 --> 01:06:16,494
It's for refurbishing
the dean's mansion.

1527
01:06:16,572 --> 01:06:17,698
I can see.

1528
01:06:17,773 --> 01:06:20,901
You got very expensive taste
in furniture.

1529
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:22,604
Too expensive.

1530
01:06:22,678 --> 01:06:25,078
Sal, we had a deal.

1531
01:06:25,147 --> 01:06:26,774
As soon as the alumni
come through...

1532
01:06:26,849 --> 01:06:28,339
I'll pay you back.

1533
01:06:28,417 --> 01:06:29,714
What deal?

1534
01:06:29,785 --> 01:06:30,877
There is no deal.

1535
01:06:30,953 --> 01:06:34,150
I want my money now.
Now!

1536
01:06:34,223 --> 01:06:36,783
But I owe other people too.

1537
01:06:36,859 --> 01:06:39,191
Yeah, but with them,
you just get a nasty phone call.

1538
01:06:39,261 --> 01:06:42,424
With me, you get Bruno.

1539
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:45,167
Oh, hi, Bruno.

1540
01:06:45,234 --> 01:06:46,201
What's the matter?

1541
01:06:46,268 --> 01:06:47,565
You look
a little hot there, Dean.

1542
01:06:47,636 --> 01:06:49,103
No wonder.
This is so heavy.

1543
01:06:49,171 --> 01:06:50,798
You ever think about goin'
with somethin'

1544
01:06:50,873 --> 01:06:52,465
...a little bit lighter,
say, a 110?

1545
01:06:52,541 --> 01:06:54,873
So much softer, you know?
Breathes better, you know?

1546
01:06:54,944 --> 01:06:57,105
It's done wonders for me.
Look at this.

1547
01:06:57,179 --> 01:06:58,168
Oh, yeah.

1548
01:06:58,247 --> 01:06:59,407
See that?
Yeah.

1549
01:06:59,482 --> 01:07:01,074
I sleep like a baby now.
Well, thank you.

1550
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:02,208
II'll give it some thought.

1551
01:07:02,284 --> 01:07:03,717
Terrific.

1552
01:07:03,786 --> 01:07:06,914
Now, I want to discuss a little
business proposition with you.

1553
01:07:06,989 --> 01:07:08,479
Well, it's not exactly
a proposition.

1554
01:07:08,557 --> 01:07:09,990
It's more like a...
what do you call it?

1555
01:07:10,059 --> 01:07:11,026
Hostile takeover, boss.

1556
01:07:11,093 --> 01:07:12,082
Hostile takeover.

1557
01:07:12,161 --> 01:07:13,719
HH-hostile takeover?

1558
01:07:13,796 --> 01:07:16,993
As in,
I take over the school.

1559
01:07:17,066 --> 01:07:19,432
This is a prime piece
of real estate you got here.

1560
01:07:19,502 --> 01:07:20,696
I can turn a pretty penny.

1561
01:07:20,770 --> 01:07:23,534
But it's been in my family
for generations.

1562
01:07:23,606 --> 01:07:27,303
Aw, we're gonna have to put up
a plaque or somethin', you know.

1563
01:07:27,376 --> 01:07:30,243
Hey, we can put it
right in the new parking lot...

1564
01:07:30,312 --> 01:07:33,645
which is going to be very soon.

1565
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:36,514
...right here where your office
is right now.

1566
01:07:36,585 --> 01:07:37,552
A parking lot?

1567
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:38,587
What is this?

1568
01:07:38,654 --> 01:07:39,848
That's French, boss.

1569
01:07:39,922 --> 01:07:40,911
French?

1570
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:42,582
Ming.
Ming?

1571
01:07:42,658 --> 01:07:44,353
Ming.

1572
01:07:44,427 --> 01:07:46,361
I don't care
for the Ming thing.

1573
01:07:46,429 --> 01:07:51,696
Ooh, look at those sparkles.
That's good crystal.

1574
01:07:51,767 --> 01:07:53,735
It's leaded.
Yeah, excellent quality.

1575
01:07:53,803 --> 01:07:55,134
I like that chair.

1576
01:07:55,204 --> 01:07:57,001
You got it, Mr. Hugo.

1577
01:07:57,073 --> 01:08:00,270
No, no.

1578
01:08:00,342 --> 01:08:02,207
Oh, my God.

1579
01:08:26,969 --> 01:08:28,869
You call that a pleat?

1580
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:30,371
Drop stitch, and give me 20.

1581
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:33,067
Wow, Ms. Sandusky
is really on the ball this year.

1582
01:08:33,142 --> 01:08:35,007
I've lost it, guys,
completely.

1583
01:08:35,077 --> 01:08:36,044
It's gone.

1584
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:37,340
What are you talking about?

1585
01:08:37,413 --> 01:08:39,608
Very instinct I used to have,
good-bye.

1586
01:08:39,682 --> 01:08:41,343
I totally suck at fashion.

1587
01:08:41,417 --> 01:08:43,044
You do not suck at fashion.

1588
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:44,086
Page, help me.

1589
01:08:44,153 --> 01:08:46,087
Not totally.

1590
01:08:46,155 --> 01:08:47,952
What am I even doing?
I don't belong here.

1591
01:08:48,023 --> 01:08:49,615
I'm completely fooling myself.

1592
01:08:49,692 --> 01:08:50,716
Hey, there's Jack.

1593
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:54,456
I'll be right back.
Be nice to her.

1594
01:08:54,530 --> 01:08:56,691
Hey, at least your fingers
look thinner.

1595
01:08:56,765 --> 01:08:57,754
Here we go.

1596
01:08:57,833 --> 01:08:59,232
Come on, girls, let's do it!

1597
01:09:01,003 --> 01:09:02,129
Real loud, y'all!

1598
01:09:12,081 --> 01:09:14,174
So they actually give out
awards for this stuff, huh?

1599
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:15,376
They sure do.

1600
01:09:15,451 --> 01:09:17,351
Last year, I won the gold
in welt pocket.

1601
01:09:17,419 --> 01:09:18,784
...and buttonhole stitch.

1602
01:09:18,854 --> 01:09:20,014
Oh, nice.

1603
01:09:20,089 --> 01:09:21,579
I think the only time
I've ever won gold.

1604
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:22,919
...is for a star in attendance.

1605
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:23,981
Me too.

1606
01:09:24,059 --> 01:09:25,754
And I bet you were punctual
as well.

1607
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:28,160
Never late,
grades 2 through 12.

1608
01:09:28,230 --> 01:09:29,697
What about first?

1609
01:09:29,765 --> 01:09:32,131
Ah, it was an accident.

1610
01:09:32,201 --> 01:09:33,225
Were you okay?

1611
01:09:33,302 --> 01:09:35,361
Yeah, it was with my jeans.

1612
01:09:35,437 --> 01:09:37,029
We had to go home and change.

1613
01:09:37,106 --> 01:09:38,903
Oh.

1614
01:09:38,974 --> 01:09:39,998
I'm sorry.

1615
01:09:40,075 --> 01:09:41,440
I have this bad habit
of confessing.

1616
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:43,740
...the weirdest things
about myself.

1617
01:09:43,812 --> 01:09:45,973
Um, actually,
I'm glad you said that.

1618
01:09:46,048 --> 01:09:48,175
I have a confession myself.

1619
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:49,774
All right, Jack, this is it.

1620
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:51,410
Don't blow it.

1621
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:54,285
I'm sure you've heard some
rumors around campus about me.

1622
01:09:54,356 --> 01:09:55,584
Are they true?

1623
01:09:55,658 --> 01:09:56,955
Yes and no.
See, the thing is...

1624
01:09:57,026 --> 01:09:58,391
Actually,
you know what, Brooke?

1625
01:09:58,460 --> 01:09:59,552
It doesn't matter.
What?

1626
01:09:59,628 --> 01:10:01,095
Forget about it.
It's not important.

1627
01:10:01,163 --> 01:10:02,152
What?

1628
01:10:02,231 --> 01:10:03,425
No, no, no,
I need to tell you...

1629
01:10:03,499 --> 01:10:04,557
We... we all have our faults.

1630
01:10:04,633 --> 01:10:05,657
I mean, I once...

1631
01:10:05,734 --> 01:10:07,031
I stole a candy bar
from a market.

1632
01:10:07,102 --> 01:10:08,865
I mean, it was an accident.

1633
01:10:08,938 --> 01:10:11,031
...because a friend of mine
put it in my pocket...

1634
01:10:11,106 --> 01:10:12,573
...but the fact is,
I broke the law.

1635
01:10:12,641 --> 01:10:13,972
Okay, but for me...

1636
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:16,534
What is really important
is what's in your heart...

1637
01:10:16,612 --> 01:10:18,045
...and I can tell
that you have a good one.

1638
01:10:18,113 --> 01:10:19,102
Jack, listen.

1639
01:10:19,181 --> 01:10:21,411
I have been working for the...

1640
01:10:21,483 --> 01:10:22,677
Hey!

1641
01:10:32,127 --> 01:10:34,357
Can I have your attention,
please?

1642
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:35,556
Wait, what was that?

1643
01:10:35,631 --> 01:10:37,292
I have an important
announcement to make.

1644
01:10:37,366 --> 01:10:39,231
I'll be right back.

1645
01:10:39,301 --> 01:10:40,290
Brooke, wait.

1646
01:10:40,369 --> 01:10:41,495
You idiot!

1647
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:43,538
That's it, Jack.
That's it.

1648
01:10:43,606 --> 01:10:45,631
Oh!

1649
01:10:45,708 --> 01:10:47,539
Can I have
your attention, please?

1650
01:10:47,610 --> 01:10:49,339
I have a very important
announcement to make.

1651
01:10:49,411 --> 01:10:53,006
Hello, people, people,
please gather around.

1652
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:54,140
Gather around, everybody.

1653
01:10:54,216 --> 01:10:58,016
I have a very important
announcement to make.

1654
01:10:58,087 --> 01:11:00,180
...to you all today.

1655
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:03,350
Tomorrow's sew-off
is cancelled.

1656
01:11:04,526 --> 01:11:05,823
Aw, come on.
That's ridiculous!

1657
01:11:05,894 --> 01:11:07,259
In fact, tragically...

1658
01:11:07,329 --> 01:11:09,820
we're closing down
the entire school.

1659
01:11:11,066 --> 01:11:12,033
I'm sorry.

1660
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:13,068
There's nothing I can do.

1661
01:11:13,135 --> 01:11:14,602
It's out of my hands.

1662
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:17,070
Less competition for me.

1663
01:11:17,139 --> 01:11:18,504
Dean, you can't do this.

1664
01:11:18,574 --> 01:11:22,533
You mobsters,
always ordering people around.

1665
01:11:22,611 --> 01:11:24,169
What?
What are you talking about?

1666
01:11:24,246 --> 01:11:26,908
Sal Hugo runs things now.

1667
01:11:26,982 --> 01:11:29,849
This was his decision,
not mine.

1668
01:11:29,918 --> 01:11:33,115
I need to go home
and be with my furniture.

1669
01:11:33,188 --> 01:11:35,452
It might be my last chance.

1670
01:11:38,627 --> 01:11:41,027
Miss Taylor?

1671
01:11:41,096 --> 01:11:42,757
Or should I say Miss Sarto?

1672
01:11:42,831 --> 01:11:45,857
We need to talk.

1673
01:11:45,934 --> 01:11:47,128
Jack?

1674
01:11:49,505 --> 01:11:51,097
I'm sorry, Brooke.

1675
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:00,872
Miss Sarto, you might want
to call a lawyer about now.

1676
01:12:00,949 --> 01:12:02,177
I don't need a lawyer.

1677
01:12:02,251 --> 01:12:03,445
I haven't done anything wrong.

1678
01:12:03,519 --> 01:12:05,544
We'll let the federal
prosecutor decide that.

1679
01:12:05,621 --> 01:12:07,145
I'm changing them,
Mr. Tiernan.

1680
01:12:07,222 --> 01:12:08,587
I'm making
the family legitimate.

1681
01:12:08,657 --> 01:12:10,784
Our contacts confirm it, sir.

1682
01:12:10,859 --> 01:12:11,826
Well, if that's true...

1683
01:12:11,894 --> 01:12:13,293
...perhaps you can help us
with Sal Hugo.

1684
01:12:13,362 --> 01:12:14,989
It would go a long way
in clearing your name.

1685
01:12:15,064 --> 01:12:17,089
No way, sir.
That is way too dangerous.

1686
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:18,428
We have other options.

1687
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:20,468
Thank you, Jack,
if that's your real name...

1688
01:12:20,536 --> 01:12:21,935
...but I don't need
your phony concern.

1689
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:23,767
My feelings were not phony.

1690
01:12:23,839 --> 01:12:25,329
Jack, let me handle this,
please?

1691
01:12:25,407 --> 01:12:26,999
No, I understand that, sir,
but I have a...

1692
01:12:27,076 --> 01:12:28,065
Hey!

1693
01:12:28,143 --> 01:12:29,940
I have my own issues
with Sal Hugo.

1694
01:12:30,012 --> 01:12:31,343
He's trying
to take over my school.

1695
01:12:31,413 --> 01:12:33,745
Then maybe
we can help each other.

1696
01:12:33,816 --> 01:12:35,283
That's
a really good idea, sir.

1697
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:36,818
That was my idea.

1698
01:12:36,885 --> 01:12:39,217
No, I know, but I'm just
suggesting that I could help...

1699
01:12:39,288 --> 01:12:40,846
We don't need your help.
But it's not...

1700
01:12:40,923 --> 01:12:41,890
I don't want your help.

1701
01:12:41,957 --> 01:12:43,288
You should seek help.

1702
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:46,726
I really should have changed
my hair for this picture.

1703
01:12:46,795 --> 01:12:48,285
George, you've got to help us.

1704
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:50,355
I can't pull together
that kind of cash...

1705
01:12:50,432 --> 01:12:52,127
...not so fast.

1706
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:53,259
Well, then, we'll raise it.

1707
01:12:53,335 --> 01:12:54,859
The school is not closing.

1708
01:12:54,937 --> 01:12:56,029
But what can we do?

1709
01:12:56,105 --> 01:12:57,299
What we do best.

1710
01:12:57,373 --> 01:12:58,397
We'll put on a fashion show.

1711
01:12:58,474 --> 01:12:59,805
Yes, that's perfect.

1712
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:01,365
We'll sell
all the clothes afterwards.

1713
01:13:01,443 --> 01:13:02,808
...and squeeze every penny
we can get.

1714
01:13:02,878 --> 01:13:05,369
Well, we got a lot
to squeeze, though.

1715
01:13:05,447 --> 01:13:06,641
Gonna take
a lot of planning.

1716
01:13:06,715 --> 01:13:08,683
Can I be in charge of it?

1717
01:13:09,885 --> 01:13:11,113
I can do it.

1718
01:13:11,186 --> 01:13:13,051
Please.

1719
01:13:15,858 --> 01:13:16,882
Okay.

1720
01:13:27,703 --> 01:13:29,466
Hope I did the right thing.

1721
01:13:29,538 --> 01:13:30,505
You're the boss.

1722
01:13:30,572 --> 01:13:31,561
Yeah.

1723
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:37,242
We will save the school!

1724
01:13:44,853 --> 01:13:47,219
Now come on back and sign up.

1725
01:13:49,124 --> 01:13:52,150
Hey!

1726
01:13:55,364 --> 01:13:57,264
Love has gotten me nowhere.

1727
01:13:57,332 --> 01:13:58,458
That's right, dear.

1728
01:13:58,534 --> 01:13:59,501
You let it out.

1729
01:13:59,568 --> 01:14:01,035
You'll feel better.

1730
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:03,071
I'm always falling
for the wrong guy, always.

1731
01:14:03,138 --> 01:14:05,402
It's like my keen senses
only apply to fashion.

1732
01:14:05,474 --> 01:14:07,408
You aren't the only one.

1733
01:14:07,476 --> 01:14:10,968
Okay, yes, I lied too.

1734
01:14:11,046 --> 01:14:12,536
But I thought
we really had something.

1735
01:14:12,614 --> 01:14:15,412
It turns out I'm just a way
to advance his career.

1736
01:14:15,484 --> 01:14:17,315
Didn't work.

1737
01:14:17,386 --> 01:14:18,717
I've been suspended.

1738
01:14:21,390 --> 01:14:24,757
You, uh, mind if I join you?

1739
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,194
You see, when I was a kid...

1740
01:14:33,268 --> 01:14:35,361
...my grandparents' shop
was burned to the ground.

1741
01:14:35,437 --> 01:14:36,563
...by Sal Hugo.

1742
01:14:36,638 --> 01:14:38,105
That's why
I initially joined the FBI...

1743
01:14:38,173 --> 01:14:41,370
...to take people like him down.

1744
01:14:41,443 --> 01:14:43,934
So now you want me
to help you?

1745
01:14:44,012 --> 01:14:48,608
No, I just want you to
understand why I did what I did.

1746
01:14:48,684 --> 01:14:53,383
Okay, look, it's knit one.

1747
01:14:53,455 --> 01:14:55,252
Purl two.

1748
01:14:55,324 --> 01:14:56,757
See?

1749
01:15:01,597 --> 01:15:03,588
This isn't more
undercover work, is it?

1750
01:15:03,665 --> 01:15:05,394
I mean, you're not wired
or anything, are you?

1751
01:15:05,467 --> 01:15:06,661
No.

1752
01:15:06,735 --> 01:15:09,169
The only thing undercover
was my job.

1753
01:15:09,238 --> 01:15:12,401
My feelings have been out
in the open the entire time.

1754
01:15:15,477 --> 01:15:16,569
I have to go.

1755
01:15:16,645 --> 01:15:17,612
Wait.

1756
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:20,341
What are you gonna do
about Sal?

1757
01:15:20,415 --> 01:15:25,648
Make him an offer
he can't refuse.

1758
01:15:25,721 --> 01:15:27,154
Well, be careful.

1759
01:15:27,222 --> 01:15:29,247
Now, let me get this straight.

1760
01:15:29,324 --> 01:15:31,087
You're gonna get me my money...

1761
01:15:31,159 --> 01:15:34,287
...and you want to give me
all of your businesses?

1762
01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:36,729
Xcept for the dress factory.
That's nonnegotiable.

1763
01:15:36,798 --> 01:15:37,924
Keep it.

1764
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:41,367
All those salaries
with the dental insurance.

1765
01:15:41,436 --> 01:15:44,064
...and the 401 this and that.

1766
01:15:44,139 --> 01:15:45,436
Who wants it?

1767
01:15:45,507 --> 01:15:46,565
I do.

1768
01:15:46,642 --> 01:15:48,269
And all I gotta do.

1769
01:15:48,343 --> 01:15:50,811
...is to let you keep
the fashion school open?

1770
01:15:50,879 --> 01:15:52,642
That's the deal, Sal.

1771
01:15:52,714 --> 01:15:54,147
I don't know.

1772
01:15:54,216 --> 01:15:56,650
Anything looks this perfect,
usually there's something wrong.

1773
01:15:56,718 --> 01:15:58,811
Our families fight,
and nobody wins.

1774
01:15:58,887 --> 01:16:00,252
In the end...

1775
01:16:00,322 --> 01:16:02,449
...maybe you'll be the one
giving me your businesses.

1776
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:07,652
You really think you could
pull off something like that?

1777
01:16:07,729 --> 01:16:09,959
I do.

1778
01:16:13,869 --> 01:16:15,496
Okay.

1779
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:17,129
Let's talk dollar amounts.

1780
01:16:17,205 --> 01:16:19,366
Cigar?

1781
01:16:39,861 --> 01:16:40,828
Okay, think, Dee.

1782
01:16:40,896 --> 01:16:41,920
What do we do?
What do we do?

1783
01:16:41,997 --> 01:16:43,021
George!
What's wrong?

1784
01:16:43,098 --> 01:16:44,326
Some of the models
aren't here...

1785
01:16:44,399 --> 01:16:45,525
...and the show's about to start!

1786
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:46,625
Dee, what is the holdup?

1787
01:16:46,702 --> 01:16:47,999
Some of the models
aren't here...

1788
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:49,196
...and the show's about to start!

1789
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:50,932
What?
Hey, what's going on?

1790
01:16:51,006 --> 01:16:54,169
You're late,
and I'm tired of explaining it.

1791
01:16:54,242 --> 01:16:56,676
You know, somebody
must have given the models.

1792
01:16:56,745 --> 01:16:58,178
...the wrong address.

1793
01:16:58,246 --> 01:17:00,544
Now, who would do that?

1794
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:02,106
I've had about enough
from her!

1795
01:17:02,184 --> 01:17:05,847
George, don't waste your time.
Okay, look, let's not panic.

1796
01:17:05,921 --> 01:17:08,219
We will be the models.

1797
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:09,348
Xcuse me?

1798
01:17:09,424 --> 01:17:10,857
Okay, Page and I
will be the models.

1799
01:17:10,926 --> 01:17:12,325
But the sizes
will be all wrong.

1800
01:17:12,394 --> 01:17:14,988
Please, girl,
I can fit into anything.

1801
01:17:15,063 --> 01:17:16,553
Come on.
Come on, now.

1802
01:17:16,632 --> 01:17:17,621
Yeah!

1803
01:17:17,699 --> 01:17:19,690
See?
It's perfect.

1804
01:17:19,768 --> 01:17:20,735
Yeah, it's good.

1805
01:17:20,802 --> 01:17:21,996
Just mix and match
some outfits.

1806
01:17:22,070 --> 01:17:23,469
...and make
some alterations, please?

1807
01:17:23,538 --> 01:17:24,869
I think I'd rather model.

1808
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:26,840
It's gonna be fine.
George, help her.

1809
01:17:26,908 --> 01:17:28,967
What are you waiting for?
For you to do everything.

1810
01:17:29,044 --> 01:17:30,443
You got the ability.
I know you do.

1811
01:17:30,512 --> 01:17:31,740
You just need to trust
yourself.

1812
01:17:31,813 --> 01:17:32,837
Okay.

1813
01:17:32,914 --> 01:17:34,040
Well, let's go!
Let's do it!

1814
01:17:34,116 --> 01:17:36,812
Okay.
Mix those outfits.

1815
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:43,481
Brooke Sarto
and Fashion University.

1816
01:18:43,552 --> 01:18:45,144
welcomes you
to the first annual.

1817
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:48,155
Save The School Fashion Show.

1818
01:18:57,132 --> 01:18:58,463
One minute, ladies!

1819
01:18:58,533 --> 01:19:00,125
One minute!

1820
01:19:02,537 --> 01:19:03,697
Don't just sit there,
George.

1821
01:19:03,772 --> 01:19:05,000
Find me some pinking shears.

1822
01:19:05,073 --> 01:19:07,041
Move!

1823
01:19:11,079 --> 01:19:12,068
Thank you.

1824
01:20:44,773 --> 01:20:46,673
And once again,
ladies and gentlemen...

1825
01:20:46,741 --> 01:20:48,641
...a sneak peek at the hottest
new look of tomorrow.

1826
01:20:48,710 --> 01:20:51,770
Looks are from signature series
appropriately labeled.

1827
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:55,283
Crimes of Fashion.

1828
01:21:13,201 --> 01:21:14,759
Now let's give it up
for your host...

1829
01:21:14,836 --> 01:21:16,736
...the boldest newcomer
to the fashion world...

1830
01:21:16,805 --> 01:21:18,705
Brooke Sarto!

1831
01:22:36,484 --> 01:22:40,318
Your designs are stunning,
my dear, absolutely stunning.

1832
01:22:40,388 --> 01:22:43,380
You are definitely
going places.

1833
01:22:43,458 --> 01:22:47,019
But you still got
the afternoon shift Friday.

1834
01:22:47,095 --> 01:22:48,858
Don't forget, 3:00 to 6:00.

1835
01:22:48,930 --> 01:22:49,897
Don't be late.

1836
01:22:49,965 --> 01:22:51,262
Brooke!

1837
01:22:51,333 --> 01:22:53,358
Neiman Marcus is downstairs
and wants to talk to you.

1838
01:22:53,435 --> 01:22:54,561
What?

1839
01:22:54,636 --> 01:22:56,331
There is a buyer here
from Bloomingdale's.

1840
01:22:56,404 --> 01:22:57,894
Can you believe it?
Bloomies!

1841
01:22:57,973 --> 01:22:59,406
But how?

1842
01:22:59,474 --> 01:23:04,070
I called in a few favors,
bent a few arms.

1843
01:23:04,145 --> 01:23:05,237
Bent, not broke.

1844
01:23:05,313 --> 01:23:07,873
You did it.
You saved the school.

1845
01:23:07,949 --> 01:23:09,974
You're a real
honest-to-God designer now.

1846
01:23:10,051 --> 01:23:11,177
Oh, I don't know.

1847
01:23:11,252 --> 01:23:12,514
Do you really think
I'm ready for that?

1848
01:23:12,587 --> 01:23:13,554
Yes!
Yes!

1849
01:23:13,621 --> 01:23:14,815
This is just the beginning.

1850
01:23:14,889 --> 01:23:16,754
It's everything you worked for.

1851
01:23:16,825 --> 01:23:20,352
Okay, there's just
one more thing I have to do.

1852
01:23:20,428 --> 01:23:22,157
Okay, so we're square
then, right?

1853
01:23:22,230 --> 01:23:24,027
I hand over all
the illegal operations to you...

1854
01:23:24,099 --> 01:23:26,329
...and you let me keep the school.

1855
01:23:26,401 --> 01:23:27,993
I don't think so.

1856
01:23:28,069 --> 01:23:29,001
Wait.
What?

1857
01:23:29,070 --> 01:23:30,560
We had a deal.

1858
01:23:30,638 --> 01:23:33,573
Yeah, and I just broke it,
'cause this way, I get it all.

1859
01:23:33,641 --> 01:23:34,767
See, I like parking lots...

1860
01:23:34,843 --> 01:23:38,108
...and your school
has a lot of potential.

1861
01:23:38,179 --> 01:23:39,373
You can't do this.

1862
01:23:39,447 --> 01:23:40,607
What, are you kiddin'?

1863
01:23:40,682 --> 01:23:41,944
This is what I do best.

1864
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:43,245
I lie.

1865
01:23:43,318 --> 01:23:45,582
I extort, except on my taxes...

1866
01:23:45,653 --> 01:23:47,211
'cause I don't even pay taxes.

1867
01:23:47,288 --> 01:23:52,123
See, I do bad things
to good people.

1868
01:23:52,193 --> 01:23:53,592
And I enjoy it.

1869
01:23:53,661 --> 01:23:56,892
And the best part is
that nobody can stop me.

1870
01:23:56,965 --> 01:23:59,763
Nobody.

1871
01:23:59,834 --> 01:24:01,631
That's a nice earring
you got there.

1872
01:24:01,703 --> 01:24:03,227
Don't pay your taxes, huh?

1873
01:24:06,341 --> 01:24:08,400
That's not good, Sal.

1874
01:24:08,476 --> 01:24:09,534
Smile.

1875
01:24:09,611 --> 01:24:11,010
You're on Government Sting TV.

1876
01:24:11,079 --> 01:24:12,046
Nobody move!

1877
01:24:12,113 --> 01:24:13,080
Nobody move!

1878
01:24:13,148 --> 01:24:15,309
That was a joke.

1879
01:24:15,383 --> 01:24:16,350
It's all over, Sal.

1880
01:24:16,418 --> 01:24:17,385
Keep your hands up, sir.

1881
01:24:17,452 --> 01:24:18,476
Hey, careful.
This is 110.

1882
01:24:18,553 --> 01:24:19,679
It's very delicate.

1883
01:24:19,754 --> 01:24:21,244
Tell it to a judge.
Take him away, guys.

1884
01:24:21,322 --> 01:24:22,516
Bye.

1885
01:24:23,858 --> 01:24:25,348
Nice work, Jack.

1886
01:24:25,427 --> 01:24:27,987
Gonna get a commendation
for this one.

1887
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:29,462
Nice work.

1888
01:24:29,531 --> 01:24:32,056
Thanks.

1889
01:24:32,133 --> 01:24:35,364
So I guess you're all done
with the case now.

1890
01:24:35,437 --> 01:24:36,597
Guess so.

1891
01:24:36,671 --> 01:24:38,161
That's what I thought.

1892
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:40,673
But a complicated case
like this...

1893
01:24:40,742 --> 01:24:43,506
...there's probably
a lot of cleaning up to do.

1894
01:24:43,578 --> 01:24:45,603
Oh, yes, a lot.

1895
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:49,172
Yeah, it could take weeks,
even... Even months.

1896
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:51,775
Well, you could start
by interviewing me...

1897
01:24:51,853 --> 01:24:53,514
...you know, one-on-one.

1898
01:24:53,588 --> 01:24:55,647
Well, you are
the star witness.

1899
01:25:04,399 --> 01:25:05,366
It was a joke.

1900
01:25:05,433 --> 01:25:06,400
I was kidding.

1901
01:25:06,468 --> 01:25:07,935
It was a joke.

1902
01:25:08,002 --> 01:25:09,469
Hey, Sal.

1903
01:25:09,537 --> 01:25:11,334
I told you we got somebody.

1904
01:25:11,406 --> 01:25:13,806
You...

1905
01:25:24,819 --> 01:25:28,311
Brooke, they arrested the dean
for embezzling school funds.

1906
01:25:28,389 --> 01:25:30,516
Great.
Who's gonna be the dean now?

1907
01:25:43,905 --> 01:25:45,429
Xpelled?

1908
01:25:45,507 --> 01:25:47,134
But how will this look
on my rêsumê?

1909
01:25:47,208 --> 01:25:48,675
You cheated.

1910
01:25:48,743 --> 01:25:53,373
You stole someone else's designs
and claimed them as your own.

1911
01:25:53,448 --> 01:25:55,177
Put that on your rêsumê.

1912
01:25:55,250 --> 01:25:56,376
Well, what about Brooke?

1913
01:25:56,451 --> 01:25:57,782
I mean, she's a mob boss.

1914
01:25:57,852 --> 01:25:59,717
Nothing in the rules
against that.

1915
01:25:59,787 --> 01:26:02,517
Besides,
I just don't like you.

1916
01:26:03,958 --> 01:26:05,220
Hi.

1917
01:26:05,293 --> 01:26:06,487
What's she doing here?

1918
01:26:06,561 --> 01:26:08,586
She is getting
what she deserves.

1919
01:26:08,663 --> 01:26:11,131
I enrolled Rosa this morning.

1920
01:26:11,199 --> 01:26:13,326
Full scholarship.

1921
01:26:13,401 --> 01:26:14,993
Yours actually.

1922
01:26:15,069 --> 01:26:16,502
Works out very nicely.

1923
01:26:25,079 --> 01:26:26,137
Thank you so much.

1924
01:26:26,214 --> 01:26:27,909
It's been my dream
to come here.

1925
01:26:27,982 --> 01:26:28,971
Can I go tell my mom?

1926
01:26:29,050 --> 01:26:30,142
Sure, go ahead.

1927
01:26:30,218 --> 01:26:33,813
Remember, though,
class starts at 9:00.

1928
01:26:33,888 --> 01:26:35,515
Good work, dean.

1929
01:26:35,590 --> 01:26:38,525
You can still call me George.

1930
01:26:38,593 --> 01:26:40,652
This place is gonna look great
when you add your touch...

1931
01:26:40,728 --> 01:26:42,059
...you know, get rid of the gold.

1932
01:26:46,134 --> 01:26:50,332
Hey, that's me
with my asy-Sew...

1933
01:26:50,405 --> 01:26:52,032
...standing next to you.

1934
01:26:52,106 --> 01:26:54,666
I don't...

1935
01:26:54,742 --> 01:26:56,300
You were the ex-orphan.

1936
01:26:56,377 --> 01:26:57,344
You were Donny.

1937
01:26:57,412 --> 01:26:58,936
Yes, my special angel.

1938
01:26:59,013 --> 01:27:00,776
It was me.

1939
01:27:00,848 --> 01:27:01,815
I can't believe it.

1940
01:27:01,883 --> 01:27:03,316
Did my grandfather send you?

1941
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:12,588
Brooke...

1942
01:27:12,660 --> 01:27:13,991
I am your grandfather.

1943
01:27:14,062 --> 01:27:15,324
What?

1944
01:27:15,396 --> 01:27:16,795
You're not my grandfather.

1945
01:27:16,864 --> 01:27:17,888
Come on.

1946
01:27:17,966 --> 01:27:19,433
That's...

1947
01:27:22,136 --> 01:27:25,003
Oh, my God.

1948
01:27:25,073 --> 01:27:26,301
You are my grandfather.

1949
01:27:26,374 --> 01:27:28,001
Why didn't you tell me?

1950
01:27:28,076 --> 01:27:32,012
You were so angry,
I couldn't.

1951
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:35,675
And when my cousin died,
I faked my own death...

1952
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:37,479
...and I was planning
to disappear.

1953
01:27:37,552 --> 01:27:39,452
...once you took over the family
and made it legit...

1954
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:41,385
...but I couldn't.

1955
01:27:41,456 --> 01:27:43,754
Why?
Why couldn't you?

1956
01:27:43,825 --> 01:27:49,388
You opened a piece of my heart
that had been shut long ago.

1957
01:27:51,332 --> 01:27:54,199
So I couldn't leave you again.

1958
01:27:54,269 --> 01:27:57,033
Not ever.

1959
01:27:57,105 --> 01:28:00,404
Anyway, I know you
can't forgive me for all this...

1960
01:28:00,475 --> 01:28:03,501
...but I...
I did it for you.

1961
01:28:06,648 --> 01:28:08,843
I love you, Grandpa.

1962
01:28:11,085 --> 01:28:14,077
I love you too, sweetie.

1963
01:28:20,361 --> 01:28:22,556
# Step up #

1964
01:28:22,630 --> 01:28:27,567
# There's no reason
to hesitate #

1965
01:28:27,635 --> 01:28:29,193
# We're primed,
and we're restless #

1966
01:28:29,270 --> 01:28:31,101
# So we better start moving #

1967
01:28:31,172 --> 01:28:35,302
# Come on #

1968
01:28:35,376 --> 01:28:39,073
# All this waiting,
all this wonder #

1969
01:28:39,147 --> 01:28:41,445
# Now our time has come #

1970
01:28:41,516 --> 01:28:44,383
# We're making history #

1971
01:28:44,452 --> 01:28:46,750
# very second adds up
to what we'll be... #

1972
01:28:46,821 --> 01:28:50,780
Miss Taylor, come out
with your hands in the air!

1973
01:28:50,858 --> 01:28:52,485
Oh, my God!

1974
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:55,552
Oh, it's so beautiful.

1975
01:28:55,630 --> 01:28:57,097
Thank you.

1976
01:28:57,165 --> 01:28:58,462
# It's not just victory #

1977
01:28:58,533 --> 01:29:00,899
# We're standing in the presence
of royalty... #
