1
00:00:00,148 --> 00:00:02,639
<i>And apparently so do the fans.</i>

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:07,778
Hey, shitheads! Listen up!

3
00:00:07,989 --> 00:00:09,820
Everybody on their feet
for the warden.

4
00:00:14,262 --> 00:00:16,662
Anthony, wow. You can sit down.

5
00:00:17,698 --> 00:00:19,222
Thank God.

6
00:00:21,002 --> 00:00:23,698
Gentlemen, Texas marshals
have been kind enough

7
00:00:23,905 --> 00:00:27,397
to supply us with a dozen
of their finest sharpshooters.

8
00:00:28,042 --> 00:00:31,341
So for those of you thinking
of mingling with the civilians

9
00:00:31,546 --> 00:00:33,173
or trying to make a break for it,

10
00:00:33,748 --> 00:00:35,147
you will be shot.

11
00:00:36,851 --> 00:00:37,977
In the head.

12
00:00:41,689 --> 00:00:44,852
Now, let's all go out there
and have some fun!

13
00:00:47,795 --> 00:00:50,958
Crewe! I'll see you on the field!

14
00:00:53,467 --> 00:00:55,128
I think he's in love with you.

15
00:00:56,204 --> 00:00:58,195
All right, listen up.

16
00:00:58,406 --> 00:01:02,308
I know it's hard to get psyched for
the game without Caretaker being here.

17
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,704
But somehow that sick,
skinny bastard

18
00:01:05,913 --> 00:01:09,906
found a way to get us all fired up
from beyond the grave.

19
00:01:11,052 --> 00:01:13,520
Caretaker's last gift to us.

20
00:01:13,721 --> 00:01:16,417
Battle, I presume this is yours.

21
00:01:18,192 --> 00:01:20,353
I still don't think that's big enough.

22
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,192
- That's it?
- No, that ain't it.

23
00:01:25,533 --> 00:01:28,001
Caretaker said he'd find us
some gear to wear.

24
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,765
I think he found us a name too.

25
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:42,279
<i>Mean Machine! Mean Machine!
Mean Machine! Mean Machine!</i>

26
00:01:55,162 --> 00:01:59,599
<i>Good afternoon and welcome to a
very special edition of ESPN football.</i>

27
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,167
<i>As today, the semipro
Allenville Federal Prison guards</i>

28
00:02:03,371 --> 00:02:05,999
<i>will be taking on the very prisoners
they guard.</i>

29
00:02:06,207 --> 00:02:09,643
And with this special game, folks,
comes a special broadcast,

30
00:02:09,844 --> 00:02:13,109
as I'm joined in the booth
by Baby Face Bob.

31
00:02:13,314 --> 00:02:15,043
Say hi to the folks, Bob-O.

32
00:02:16,751 --> 00:02:18,446
Chris, we went to a commercial.

33
00:02:18,653 --> 00:02:21,850
This job, Bob,
it's a lot of give and take.

34
00:02:22,056 --> 00:02:24,854
So when I bring you in,
don't be afraid to talk to the folks.

35
00:02:27,194 --> 00:02:29,162
Unless you don't want to.

36
00:02:32,566 --> 00:02:34,090
<i>And here come the cons,</i>

37
00:02:34,302 --> 00:02:38,261
<i>led by former NFL MVP quarterback
Paul Crewe.</i>

38
00:02:43,511 --> 00:02:46,105
Holy shit. Hey, hey, hey.

39
00:02:46,314 --> 00:02:47,941
Well, hello. How are you?

40
00:02:48,149 --> 00:02:49,616
Back away from the girls!

41
00:02:49,817 --> 00:02:51,944
- Hey, now.
- Call me!

42
00:02:53,821 --> 00:02:55,618
What the hell
are you dressed up for?

43
00:02:55,823 --> 00:02:59,384
Hey, I didn't spend 14 years
in the joint just to watch this game.

44
00:02:59,593 --> 00:03:01,390
<i>And there in the
high-security bleachers</i>

45
00:03:01,595 --> 00:03:04,962
<i>are the good-behavior cons,
along with their...</i>

46
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,258
<i>...cheerleaders?</i>

47
00:03:07,468 --> 00:03:09,493
<i>We're the mean machine
Don't mean to dis you</i>

48
00:03:09,704 --> 00:03:12,298
<i>We're gonna kick your ass
And then we'll kiss you</i>

49
00:03:12,707 --> 00:03:15,301
<i>Hey! Ho!
What?</i>

50
00:03:18,145 --> 00:03:20,409
I didn't do it!

51
00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:32,517
Come on, Batt!

52
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:49,866
- What's that?
- Did you see that?

53
00:03:53,748 --> 00:03:54,806
Damn it!

54
00:03:56,183 --> 00:04:00,017
<i>Papajohn's at the 20, the 10.
And he will score.</i>

55
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,884
Sweet dreams, bitch.

56
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,187
<i>That's a 90-yard return.</i>

57
00:04:08,396 --> 00:04:12,093
And I gotta tell you, the cons seem
more interested in hitting the guards

58
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:14,028
than tackling the ball carrier.

59
00:04:14,235 --> 00:04:19,138
Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad.
Thanks for picking me up from school.

60
00:04:20,307 --> 00:04:22,775
<i>And here comes the big story
of the day.</i>

61
00:04:22,977 --> 00:04:25,343
<i>Paul Crewe,
serving a three-year sentence,</i>

62
00:04:25,546 --> 00:04:28,913
<i>hasn't played since he was banned
from the NFL six years ago.</i>

63
00:04:29,283 --> 00:04:32,252
Center, shift it! Shift it!

64
00:04:36,023 --> 00:04:37,251
Hey, Sasquatch!

65
00:04:41,195 --> 00:04:42,287
Twenty, hut!

66
00:04:42,496 --> 00:04:45,693
<i>Crewe drops back to pass.
Turley's leaving him unprotected.</i>

67
00:04:46,867 --> 00:04:48,596
Fumble!

68
00:04:51,572 --> 00:04:52,698
Holy shit!

69
00:04:54,775 --> 00:04:56,140
Goddamn it.

70
00:04:56,343 --> 00:04:58,868
<i>That's gonna be a personal foul
on the big guy.</i>

71
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,878
<i>And this is certainly an inauspicious
start for the cons.</i>

72
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:05,382
Come here! All right! You got him.
Now, protect me!

73
00:05:05,853 --> 00:05:08,117
Let's go! Hold them!

74
00:05:08,823 --> 00:05:13,192
<i>And here comes Knauer and that
big offensive unit for the guards.</i>

75
00:05:18,032 --> 00:05:19,192
Eighty-six.

76
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,990
Back to your cell.

77
00:05:22,503 --> 00:05:23,834
Hut! Hut!

78
00:05:28,676 --> 00:05:32,544
<i>Knauer has Potter wide open.
Touchdown, guards.</i>

79
00:05:33,981 --> 00:05:36,176
<i>- Son of a bitch!
- And in the first 90 seconds,</i>

80
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:38,578
<i>the guards are up
by two touchdowns.</i>

81
00:05:38,786 --> 00:05:42,051
This one looks like
it could be over early.

82
00:05:42,456 --> 00:05:43,753
Sorry.

83
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:46,859
What are we celebrating for?!
It's 14-nothing!

84
00:05:47,061 --> 00:05:50,519
You guys wanna beat these assholes,
do it on the scoreboard!

85
00:05:51,232 --> 00:05:54,895
Are you okay? Oh, God,
you're not hurt, are you?

86
00:05:55,102 --> 00:05:56,797
Jesus, you sound like my mother.

87
00:05:57,004 --> 00:06:01,600
Listen, if you wanna cry,
you go ahead and cry. I'll cry with you.

88
00:06:01,809 --> 00:06:04,744
Get off me! Get back out there
and kick some ass!

89
00:06:04,945 --> 00:06:08,039
Why are you yelling at me?
All I did was care!

90
00:06:09,717 --> 00:06:13,414
Look! A broken leg will heal.

91
00:06:13,621 --> 00:06:16,522
A loss to the Mean Machine
lasts forever.

92
00:06:19,226 --> 00:06:20,193
Sorry, guys.

93
00:06:20,761 --> 00:06:22,126
Yeah, yeah. Me too.

94
00:06:23,864 --> 00:06:26,298
All right. Now, let's get started!

95
00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:31,502
Now, get the hell out there! Let's go!

96
00:06:44,885 --> 00:06:45,874
Way to go! Way to go!

97
00:06:46,086 --> 00:06:48,816
<i>There's the first sign of life
from the cons.</i>

98
00:06:49,023 --> 00:06:52,959
Let's see if Paul "Motley" Crewe
can make something happen.

99
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,127
Hut!

100
00:06:54,328 --> 00:06:58,196
<i>On first down, Crewe will throw.
He's got Deacon wide open.</i>

101
00:06:59,934 --> 00:07:02,232
<i>That's gotta be pass interference.</i>

102
00:07:02,436 --> 00:07:04,267
<i>But the ref is waving it off.</i>

103
00:07:04,471 --> 00:07:06,530
- What?!
- Oh, come on!

104
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,208
Come on, now. I'm in this hellhole
for less than that.

105
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:12,106
- Be a man and make a call.
- You're right.

106
00:07:12,313 --> 00:07:14,873
Unsportsmanlike conduct!
Eighty-eight black!

107
00:07:15,082 --> 00:07:16,310
What?!

108
00:07:17,284 --> 00:07:18,410
Come on!

109
00:07:20,387 --> 00:07:22,014
This is baby-back bullshit!

110
00:07:22,223 --> 00:07:24,020
- Bullshit, D.
- Calm down. Let it go.

111
00:07:24,358 --> 00:07:27,259
Let's call that one
a questionable call.

112
00:07:27,661 --> 00:07:29,185
Blue 42, hut!

113
00:07:31,065 --> 00:07:34,728
<i>The give is to Megget. He spins
to the outside. Megget has room.</i>

114
00:07:36,904 --> 00:07:39,429
<i>He's at the 35. The 40.</i>

115
00:07:40,374 --> 00:07:42,433
<i>He's brought down hard,
by his facemask.</i>

116
00:07:42,843 --> 00:07:45,971
What? Oh, come on, man!
That was a facemask!

117
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,307
- You're not gonna call that?
- I saw a clean tackle, sir.

118
00:07:48,515 --> 00:07:50,449
What you looking at?
Are you serious?

119
00:07:50,651 --> 00:07:52,812
Tell it to the parole board, criminal.

120
00:07:53,387 --> 00:07:55,082
I mean, this is absurd.

121
00:07:55,289 --> 00:07:57,689
We can't win with the refs
on the payroll!

122
00:07:57,891 --> 00:08:00,917
Listen up. I got an idea
to end all this bullshit.

123
00:08:01,128 --> 00:08:03,460
Come on, let's all stay up! Come on!

124
00:08:05,332 --> 00:08:06,765
Down, set!

125
00:08:07,067 --> 00:08:08,227
Red 58.

126
00:08:08,435 --> 00:08:09,766
Cover your man!

127
00:08:10,204 --> 00:08:12,104
Red 58. Hut!

128
00:08:23,584 --> 00:08:26,075
That one hurt my marble sack.

129
00:08:28,555 --> 00:08:29,522
All right!

130
00:08:29,723 --> 00:08:31,520
- You all right?
- Yeah.

131
00:08:31,725 --> 00:08:33,192
- What down is it?
- Fifth.

132
00:08:33,394 --> 00:08:35,589
- No, no. It would be fourth down.
- Okay.

133
00:08:39,667 --> 00:08:42,864
What do you think?
Should I go for the left nut this time?

134
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:45,463
Underneath! Let's go!

135
00:08:45,673 --> 00:08:47,573
Ref, you gotta get in the game!
Right over here!

136
00:08:47,775 --> 00:08:52,007
<i>Well, I don't quite get this, but on fourth
and 22, the cons are gonna go for it.</i>

137
00:08:52,212 --> 00:08:53,736
Down, set!

138
00:08:53,947 --> 00:08:55,414
Red 58.

139
00:08:55,616 --> 00:08:57,140
Red 58. Hut!

140
00:09:06,427 --> 00:09:08,952
You gotta always protect
the McNuggets.

141
00:09:12,433 --> 00:09:15,197
How about from now on, you call
a fair game? How's that sound?

142
00:09:15,569 --> 00:09:16,558
Sounds good.

143
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:18,704
Okay. Wet Willie.

144
00:09:20,107 --> 00:09:21,472
Yeah, you like that.

145
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:27,476
<i>And so the guards will take over</i>

146
00:09:27,681 --> 00:09:31,139
<i>after one of the strangest
offensive series I've ever seen.</i>

147
00:09:31,485 --> 00:09:34,545
Okay, boys. We know who doesn't
have any balls out there now.

148
00:09:34,755 --> 00:09:37,246
Have we got any?
Have we got some balls?

149
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:40,985
- Yeah!
- All right! Let's go kick some ass!

150
00:09:41,428 --> 00:09:44,056
Come on, Swit, stand them up, baby.

151
00:09:44,264 --> 00:09:48,030
White 50. White 50. Hut, hut, hut!

152
00:09:48,235 --> 00:09:50,669
<i>Knauer, play action.
Here comes the blitz.</i>

153
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:57,271
<i>Switowski is so big, it's like being
tackled by a Coke machine with legs.</i>

154
00:09:57,811 --> 00:09:59,403
This is fun!

155
00:10:01,315 --> 00:10:02,942
Nice to see you smiling, Bob.

156
00:10:03,717 --> 00:10:05,150
Thanks, Chris.

157
00:10:06,653 --> 00:10:08,143
Green 90! Hut!

158
00:10:08,489 --> 00:10:10,787
<i>Third and 5,
and the give is to Megget.</i>

159
00:10:10,991 --> 00:10:13,516
<i>He's to the 40,
where he'll come up short.</i>

160
00:10:13,761 --> 00:10:16,355
<i>But look at Turley push the pile.</i>

161
00:10:16,563 --> 00:10:17,860
<i>And now Crewe.</i>

162
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:20,528
And that's a first down!

163
00:10:22,069 --> 00:10:25,368
<i>And look out. Boy, somebody better
take control of this game soon,</i>

164
00:10:25,572 --> 00:10:27,733
<i>or they're gonna need body bags
on the sidelines.</i>

165
00:10:27,941 --> 00:10:28,965
Let's go, guys.

166
00:10:29,176 --> 00:10:30,302
<i>Start of the second quarter.</i>

167
00:10:30,511 --> 00:10:33,537
<i>Cons still down by two touchdowns,
but they finally have some momentum.</i>

168
00:10:33,747 --> 00:10:35,112
Hut!

169
00:10:37,551 --> 00:10:39,746
<i>Crewe with a shovel pass to Megget.</i>

170
00:10:40,554 --> 00:10:42,784
<i>And Megget scrambles
for a first down.</i>

171
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:44,955
Oh, you fooled me.

172
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:47,059
- I got you there, didn't I?
- You did.

173
00:10:47,261 --> 00:10:49,786
You know, Engleheart, you are
the best-looking guy on your team.

174
00:10:49,997 --> 00:10:54,525
You know, Paul, in the midst of all this,
for you to say something like that is...

175
00:10:55,436 --> 00:10:56,801
Come on, let's go. Let's go, D.

176
00:10:57,004 --> 00:10:59,131
<i>First and 10 at the guards' 35.</i>

177
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:02,240
<i>Crewe dumps it over the middle
to Deacon Moss.</i>

178
00:11:02,509 --> 00:11:07,640
<i>And he's hammered at the 17 for a
13-yard pickup, and that's a first down.</i>

179
00:11:08,248 --> 00:11:09,977
<i>- Hut!
- Crewe, trying to get his team</i>

180
00:11:10,184 --> 00:11:11,651
<i>on the scoreboard.</i>

181
00:11:12,352 --> 00:11:13,910
<i>He will throw.</i>

182
00:11:16,056 --> 00:11:18,957
<i>And it's caught by Deacon Moss
for a touchdown!</i>

183
00:11:20,294 --> 00:11:21,261
All right!

184
00:11:21,462 --> 00:11:25,455
<i>And so there'll be no shutout today,
as the cons are on the board.</i>

185
00:11:26,033 --> 00:11:29,298
Quit booing, people.
Both teams are trying very hard!

186
00:11:29,736 --> 00:11:33,001
What the hell's wrong with you?
Stop acting like a damn cheerleader!

187
00:11:33,207 --> 00:11:35,334
- Sportsmanship, try it.
- Shut up.

188
00:11:38,912 --> 00:11:40,345
Damn.

189
00:11:40,547 --> 00:11:43,710
<i>2:11 left in the first half.
And Dunham is back in at fullback.</i>

190
00:11:43,917 --> 00:11:46,784
<i>And he is a load, at 6'2", 260.</i>

191
00:11:49,256 --> 00:11:51,281
<i>Dunham, breaking tackles.</i>

192
00:11:51,492 --> 00:11:53,221
<i>He refuses to go down.</i>

193
00:11:53,894 --> 00:11:57,694
<i>But he finally does
after a 15-yard gain.</i>

194
00:11:59,233 --> 00:12:01,394
That's how a white man
runs a football.

195
00:12:01,602 --> 00:12:04,400
If I was on D, I'd crack you square
in that egg-ass head of yours.

196
00:12:04,605 --> 00:12:07,403
Yeah, but you ain't on D.
Are you, bitch?

197
00:12:08,909 --> 00:12:11,207
Switowski! Come here.

198
00:12:11,712 --> 00:12:13,839
Do you know what
he said to me in the library?

199
00:12:17,618 --> 00:12:20,348
Yes. Him. Out.

200
00:12:23,824 --> 00:12:26,793
<i>D, D, defense
D, D, defense</i>

201
00:12:26,994 --> 00:12:29,189
<i>The cons don't seem to have
an answer for Dunham,</i>

202
00:12:29,396 --> 00:12:32,957
<i>who's averaging close to 12 yards
a carry this half.</i>

203
00:12:34,601 --> 00:12:35,727
Green 67.

204
00:12:35,936 --> 00:12:37,801
Green 67. Hut!

205
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:44,939
<i>Oh, what a hit on Dunham
by Switowski.</i>

206
00:12:47,548 --> 00:12:49,914
I think I made him shit himself.

207
00:12:50,183 --> 00:12:52,242
- Shit!
- I think he just shit himself.

208
00:12:52,653 --> 00:12:54,848
I think he just shit himself.

209
00:12:55,055 --> 00:12:58,582
Good Lord.
This guy shit himself bigtime.

210
00:12:58,792 --> 00:13:02,125
See? I told you
I made him shit himself!

211
00:13:02,896 --> 00:13:05,763
Yo! I'll make sure I send
them books to the hospital, pimp.

212
00:13:05,966 --> 00:13:07,627
And some diapers.

213
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:11,999
Nineteen seconds.
We got a lot of ground to cover.

214
00:13:12,205 --> 00:13:14,537
So you bastards remember
that play we practiced in the mud?

215
00:13:14,741 --> 00:13:17,574
What are you talking about?
That was some schoolyard bullshit.

216
00:13:17,778 --> 00:13:20,770
Yeah. Let's try some
schoolyard bullshit.

217
00:13:22,683 --> 00:13:24,082
Come on, D, let's go.

218
00:13:24,284 --> 00:13:27,185
Down, set! Green 88.

219
00:13:27,521 --> 00:13:28,852
Green 88. Hut!

220
00:13:29,056 --> 00:13:33,789
<i>The clock starts to run. Crewe hands
the ball to Megget. It's a reverse.</i>

221
00:13:34,094 --> 00:13:36,153
<i>Cheeseburger Eddy's got it.</i>

222
00:13:36,363 --> 00:13:38,058
Go, baby, go!

223
00:13:38,665 --> 00:13:40,656
<i>He laterals to Deacon.</i>

224
00:13:41,868 --> 00:13:43,233
Tackle him!

225
00:13:44,504 --> 00:13:45,698
<i>To Turley.</i>

226
00:13:45,906 --> 00:13:48,568
<i>The clock is running. To Brucie.</i>

227
00:13:48,775 --> 00:13:50,800
<i>Shades of Cal-Stanford.</i>

228
00:13:51,011 --> 00:13:52,501
<i>Back to Crewe.</i>

229
00:13:53,246 --> 00:13:54,975
<i>He tosses to Megget.</i>

230
00:13:55,182 --> 00:13:56,206
Tackle him!

231
00:14:00,087 --> 00:14:02,920
<i>And look at that little Megget run.</i>

232
00:14:03,123 --> 00:14:04,852
<i>Three seconds left.</i>

233
00:14:06,126 --> 00:14:07,150
Yeah! Go!

234
00:14:08,261 --> 00:14:13,426
<i>He could go all the way. Touchdown!</i>

235
00:14:19,006 --> 00:14:20,132
Did you see that?!

236
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,705
Do that sound again.

237
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:25,007
I like that.

238
00:14:28,081 --> 00:14:30,379
<i>And so, on a miraculous play,</i>

239
00:14:30,584 --> 00:14:34,520
<i>the cons end the first half
with the score: 14-all.</i>

240
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:41,288
Bring it in.

241
00:14:42,029 --> 00:14:45,362
Do you have any idea
who's beating you out there?

242
00:14:45,565 --> 00:14:47,726
This was supposed to be a blowout,

243
00:14:47,934 --> 00:14:51,392
and they're showing you up
in front of the whole nation.

244
00:14:52,472 --> 00:14:54,099
The whole nation!

245
00:14:54,508 --> 00:14:56,703
I like it when he's angry.

246
00:14:58,979 --> 00:15:01,641
- I told you!
- Way to go, baby, way to go.

247
00:15:08,021 --> 00:15:10,888
What in the hell do you think
you're doing out there?

248
00:15:11,091 --> 00:15:12,718
Playing football, sir.

249
00:15:14,428 --> 00:15:16,259
I didn't say nothing about winning.

250
00:15:16,596 --> 00:15:18,826
We're not winning. Not yet.

251
00:15:21,935 --> 00:15:24,403
You got yourself in quite
a predicament, Mr. Crewe.

252
00:15:24,604 --> 00:15:27,072
- Is that right?
- See, it's just come to my attention

253
00:15:27,274 --> 00:15:29,333
that inmate Unger
has been taken into custody

254
00:15:29,543 --> 00:15:31,010
for the murder of Caretaker.

255
00:15:31,211 --> 00:15:33,577
- Good.
- Oh, yeah, it's good.

256
00:15:34,047 --> 00:15:37,414
Only thing is, he claims
to have an accomplice.

257
00:15:37,851 --> 00:15:39,614
Claims you knew all about it.

258
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:43,017
Hell, he even says
you sent Caretaker to your cell.

259
00:15:44,157 --> 00:15:45,385
Bullshit.

260
00:15:45,592 --> 00:15:48,789
Captain Knauer says
he saw you planning it with Unger.

261
00:15:50,197 --> 00:15:51,892
There's no way
that could hold up in court.

262
00:15:52,099 --> 00:15:53,088
Court?

263
00:15:54,968 --> 00:15:59,337
Hell, boy, in Allenville,
I'm the judge, I'm the jury,

264
00:15:59,539 --> 00:16:03,703
and in your particular case,
I'm the executioner.

265
00:16:04,578 --> 00:16:05,602
What do you want?

266
00:16:06,146 --> 00:16:07,773
I want you to lose.

267
00:16:07,981 --> 00:16:09,141
I can't do that.

268
00:16:09,349 --> 00:16:12,341
Of course you can. After all,
you've had plenty of practice.

269
00:16:12,552 --> 00:16:15,988
But the men. It's more important
to them than it is to you.

270
00:16:17,224 --> 00:16:19,283
Okay. Suit yourself.

271
00:16:19,659 --> 00:16:23,095
Spend the next 25 years
of your useless life in prison.

272
00:16:25,332 --> 00:16:27,061
All right, I'll do it.

273
00:16:31,071 --> 00:16:34,905
But I don't want my guys hurt.
You get ahead, you coast. We clear?

274
00:16:35,108 --> 00:16:37,804
Fine. Right after I get
a two-touchdown lead.

275
00:16:39,379 --> 00:16:42,143
I tell you what bothers me
the most, warden.

276
00:16:44,317 --> 00:16:47,081
That you're not gonna be
out there on that field with us,

277
00:16:47,287 --> 00:16:49,118
getting what you got coming to you.

278
00:16:52,225 --> 00:16:55,058
The only thing coming to me
is victory.

279
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,663
Mean Machine.

280
00:17:00,267 --> 00:17:01,495
It's cute.

281
00:17:04,671 --> 00:17:06,400
- Let's go, boy!
- We can do it, baby!

282
00:17:06,606 --> 00:17:08,096
Captain.

283
00:17:09,042 --> 00:17:10,441
May I have a word?

284
00:17:10,644 --> 00:17:13,135
Don't worry, warden,
we'll take care of business.

285
00:17:13,346 --> 00:17:14,472
I already have.

286
00:17:14,915 --> 00:17:17,543
What? We can win this on our own.

287
00:17:17,751 --> 00:17:21,812
Captain, a man in my position
doesn't leave things to chance.

288
00:17:22,556 --> 00:17:25,684
Now, after you get a comfortable
three-touchdown lead,

289
00:17:25,892 --> 00:17:28,725
I want you to inflict as much pain
as humanly possible.

290
00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:31,124
Do not let up, you hear?

291
00:17:31,498 --> 00:17:34,399
I want those cons to understand
who owns them.

292
00:17:35,268 --> 00:17:36,565
Do I make myself clear?

293
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:38,067
Oh, yes, sir.

294
00:17:38,872 --> 00:17:39,839
Good.

295
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:44,232
<i>There's the kickoff, and we're
under way in the second half.</i>

296
00:17:49,983 --> 00:17:53,077
<i>Megget is finally brought down
at the guards' 33,</i>

297
00:17:53,286 --> 00:17:54,878
<i>where Paul Crewe will take over.</i>

298
00:17:55,088 --> 00:17:56,885
<i>And what a first half he's had.</i>

299
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:58,352
Here we go! Here we go!

300
00:18:01,528 --> 00:18:02,825
Down, set!

301
00:18:03,597 --> 00:18:05,724
Y 45. Hut!

302
00:18:06,633 --> 00:18:09,101
<i>On first and 10, Crewe will pass.</i>

303
00:18:09,302 --> 00:18:10,997
<i>- He's got Deacon wide open.
- Come on.</i>

304
00:18:11,204 --> 00:18:12,364
<i>Oh, incomplete.</i>

305
00:18:12,572 --> 00:18:13,664
It's okay. Get your head up.

306
00:18:14,241 --> 00:18:15,208
It's all right, man.

307
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:18,438
Come on, Paulie.

308
00:18:18,645 --> 00:18:21,910
<i>Second and 10 from the 33. Crewe's
looking for Deacon once again.</i>

309
00:18:22,115 --> 00:18:24,276
- He's open!
- He's open!

310
00:18:24,951 --> 00:18:28,853
<i>But overthrows it.
And it's picked off by Papajohn.</i>

311
00:18:29,055 --> 00:18:30,579
<i>Look out! He might go.</i>

312
00:18:32,192 --> 00:18:33,853
<i>Say goodbye.</i>

313
00:18:34,628 --> 00:18:35,617
<i>Touchdown!</i>

314
00:18:37,697 --> 00:18:41,258
The first mistake
Crewe's made all day.

315
00:18:44,304 --> 00:18:48,035
Short memory, baby.
We'll get it back. We'll get it back.

316
00:18:48,241 --> 00:18:49,868
Defense, let's do this!

317
00:18:51,077 --> 00:18:52,669
<i>8:38 left in the third quarter,</i>

318
00:18:52,879 --> 00:18:54,870
<i>and Crewe has struggled
thus far in the second half.</i>

319
00:18:55,081 --> 00:18:56,514
Hut!

320
00:18:56,716 --> 00:19:00,152
<i>The pitch to Megget.
Oh, my! That ball is live!</i>

321
00:19:01,187 --> 00:19:02,779
<i>It's picked up by Lambert.</i>

322
00:19:02,989 --> 00:19:06,254
<i>He's at the 15, the 10,
and he will score!</i>

323
00:19:07,961 --> 00:19:09,724
Yeah! Touchdown! Yeah!

324
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:14,128
<i>Crewe took a shot on that play
and he's getting up slowly.</i>

325
00:19:14,334 --> 00:19:17,770
<i>Meanwhile, in the end zone, the guards
have something to celebrate,</i>

326
00:19:17,971 --> 00:19:20,462
<i>as they find themselves up
by two touchdowns.</i>

327
00:19:20,674 --> 00:19:24,235
<i>This is simply a different Paul Crewe
we're seeing here in the second half.</i>

328
00:19:24,444 --> 00:19:26,935
There's the old Paul Crewe
we love to write about.

329
00:19:27,147 --> 00:19:28,876
What the hell are you
doing out there?

330
00:19:29,082 --> 00:19:30,572
I'm done.

331
00:19:31,885 --> 00:19:33,352
I'm out. That's it.

332
00:19:35,755 --> 00:19:37,518
- Where you hurting?
- My knee.

333
00:19:37,724 --> 00:19:39,749
- Seems okay to me.
- Well, it ain't.

334
00:19:42,429 --> 00:19:46,263
If Crewe can't go, I don't know how
deep these guys are at quarterback.

335
00:19:48,335 --> 00:19:51,771
<i>The guards will try to keep it away
from Megget, so they'll pooch kick.</i>

336
00:19:51,972 --> 00:19:53,234
Fair catch. Fair catch.

337
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,034
<i>As Big Tony calls for the fair catch.</i>

338
00:19:56,509 --> 00:20:00,172
<i>Watch out. That was as late a hit
as I've ever seen.</i>

339
00:20:01,948 --> 00:20:05,748
<i>And even some of the home crowd
not liking that one.</i>

340
00:20:05,952 --> 00:20:07,010
Hang in there, partner.

341
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:11,213
Can of corn. Can of corn,
and I'll be fine. Can of corn.

342
00:20:14,327 --> 00:20:16,522
Yeah, I'd have a hard time
looking at me too.

343
00:20:17,097 --> 00:20:18,223
Brucie.

344
00:20:18,431 --> 00:20:19,523
Yeah, coach.

345
00:20:19,733 --> 00:20:23,191
You're the only one that knows
this offense, son. Now, do it.

346
00:20:23,403 --> 00:20:25,769
<i>Coming into the game,
replacing the injured Paul Crewe,</i>

347
00:20:25,972 --> 00:20:27,303
<i>is number 1, Brucie.</i>

348
00:20:27,507 --> 00:20:29,338
All right, all right.
Crewe's playing like shit.

349
00:20:29,542 --> 00:20:31,635
That's his problem.
I'm gonna bring us back.

350
00:20:31,845 --> 00:20:34,211
Right, 32 Flex Dive Motion
on one. Ready!

351
00:20:34,414 --> 00:20:35,381
Break!

352
00:20:35,582 --> 00:20:38,176
Yeah. It's Brucie's
time to shine, baby.

353
00:20:38,752 --> 00:20:41,243
Okay. Down, set. Hut!

354
00:20:41,454 --> 00:20:45,356
<i>There's the snap and the ball is
fumbled. And the guards recover.</i>

355
00:20:45,558 --> 00:20:47,253
I knew I shouldn't
have had that popcorn.

356
00:20:48,428 --> 00:20:52,194
The guards are in command here
as we move late into the third quarter.

357
00:20:52,399 --> 00:20:53,764
Ninety-eight. Hut! Hut!

358
00:20:54,768 --> 00:20:57,794
<i>The give is to Potter.
Back to Knauer.</i>

359
00:20:58,004 --> 00:21:00,268
<i>He's got a man open
deep downfield.</i>

360
00:21:00,473 --> 00:21:02,407
<i>He'll throw the flea-flicker!</i>

361
00:21:02,609 --> 00:21:05,271
<i>And he's got it. Touchdown, guards.</i>

362
00:21:05,478 --> 00:21:08,538
<i>And this game is starting
to look like a blowout.</i>

363
00:21:10,617 --> 00:21:14,713
Hey, man, after all Caretaker did,
this is how you show him love?

364
00:21:14,921 --> 00:21:16,286
Don't worry about it.

365
00:21:16,489 --> 00:21:18,753
You haven't changed one damn bit.

366
00:21:23,229 --> 00:21:24,958
All right. Down, set!

367
00:21:25,165 --> 00:21:26,393
<i>Back in at quarterback is Brucie,</i>

368
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:29,432
<i>who will try to find a handle
on the ball this time.</i>

369
00:21:30,603 --> 00:21:31,865
Throw it, Brucie!

370
00:21:32,405 --> 00:21:33,872
Oh, shit!

371
00:21:34,207 --> 00:21:35,606
<i>And look out.</i>

372
00:21:39,646 --> 00:21:41,705
<i>What a shot he took!</i>

373
00:21:42,015 --> 00:21:43,380
How much more blood do you want?

374
00:21:46,553 --> 00:21:50,250
<i>I think the cons are just about
out of options at quarterback.</i>

375
00:22:09,642 --> 00:22:11,769
Hey, Skitchy,
let me ask you something.

376
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:15,580
When you popped the warden,
was it worth it?

377
00:22:15,782 --> 00:22:17,909
Was it worth spending
the rest of your life in here?

378
00:22:18,618 --> 00:22:22,452
Was it worth it? It was worth
every goddamn second.

379
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:32,227
What the hell is he doing?

380
00:22:35,135 --> 00:22:38,764
Paul Crewe must be feeling better,
because here he comes.

381
00:22:38,972 --> 00:22:41,338
All right, I missed you guys,
so I'm back.

382
00:22:41,541 --> 00:22:43,805
We got a lot of work to do.
Let's get it going.

383
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:46,604
Deuce right, 89. Fly on two. Ready?

384
00:22:48,948 --> 00:22:50,006
Break.

385
00:22:51,584 --> 00:22:54,610
<i>As we start the fourth quarter,
cons down by three touchdowns.</i>

386
00:22:54,821 --> 00:22:56,118
Wide left! Tight left!

387
00:22:57,857 --> 00:22:59,882
Black 90. Hut! Hut!

388
00:23:00,093 --> 00:23:02,653
<i>Here comes the blitz,
and no one's blocking!</i>

389
00:23:02,862 --> 00:23:05,854
<i>And Crewe will be sacked
for a big loss.</i>

390
00:23:06,533 --> 00:23:10,560
<i>That looked like a message to Crewe
from his offensive line.</i>

391
00:23:12,238 --> 00:23:13,967
Did you see that, man?
They're quitting on him.

392
00:23:14,174 --> 00:23:16,165
Okay, baby. Jailbreak Blitz. Ready?

393
00:23:16,509 --> 00:23:18,636
We got that out of the way.
I deserved it.

394
00:23:18,845 --> 00:23:21,211
- Now we gotta play some football.
- Switch it! Switch it!

395
00:23:21,414 --> 00:23:23,507
<i>Cons need to do something
to get back in this game.</i>

396
00:23:23,716 --> 00:23:25,547
<i>And that's not it!</i>

397
00:23:26,352 --> 00:23:28,343
<i>And Crewe is leveled!</i>

398
00:23:28,555 --> 00:23:30,853
I don't think he's gonna get up
from that one.

399
00:23:31,057 --> 00:23:32,524
Nice hit!

400
00:23:34,427 --> 00:23:37,021
<i>But he is. And I don't know how,
after that last hit.</i>

401
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:38,356
All right, punt team!

402
00:23:38,565 --> 00:23:40,931
Keep them off the field!
We're going for it.

403
00:23:41,134 --> 00:23:42,999
Dumbshits are going for it!
Let's go! Let's go!

404
00:23:43,369 --> 00:23:46,304
Come on back, if he wants to get
his ass kicked. Come on back.

405
00:23:46,506 --> 00:23:47,768
<i>This is unbelievable.</i>

406
00:23:47,974 --> 00:23:52,138
Fine. You guys don't wanna help me,
I'll do it on my own. On two.

407
00:23:53,146 --> 00:23:54,374
Let's go, to the line.

408
00:23:54,581 --> 00:23:55,912
<i>On fourth and 20,</i>

409
00:23:56,115 --> 00:23:58,913
<i>the cons are gonna go for it.
This could be the ball game right here.</i>

410
00:23:59,118 --> 00:24:01,177
Red 98. Hut! Hut!

411
00:24:02,789 --> 00:24:06,486
<i>Crewe dodges the blitz,
but he loses his helmet.</i>

412
00:24:09,963 --> 00:24:11,487
<i>And he's not going down.</i>

413
00:24:17,103 --> 00:24:19,367
<i>He's got the first down.</i>

414
00:24:19,572 --> 00:24:20,800
Time-out!

415
00:24:21,507 --> 00:24:23,168
- Man, oh, man.
- Not bad.

416
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:31,978
Huddle up.

417
00:24:33,086 --> 00:24:34,075
Look.

418
00:24:35,188 --> 00:24:38,646
I'm sure you already know this,
but I never said it out loud.

419
00:24:40,126 --> 00:24:41,889
I did throw that game.

420
00:24:43,329 --> 00:24:44,626
I did it.

421
00:24:45,465 --> 00:24:48,298
I was in a bad way
with some worse people.

422
00:24:49,135 --> 00:24:50,466
After I did it,

423
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:54,697
I felt so shitty I wish I would have
just let them kill me instead.

424
00:24:55,375 --> 00:24:59,744
Now the warden wants to pin
Caretaker's murder on me

425
00:24:59,946 --> 00:25:01,880
if I don't throw this game.

426
00:25:03,716 --> 00:25:06,184
So it looks like I'm gonna get
to know you guys a lot better,

427
00:25:06,386 --> 00:25:09,014
because I ain't doing that
twice in a lifetime.

428
00:25:09,222 --> 00:25:12,419
We got a little time left.
We can still do this.

429
00:25:12,625 --> 00:25:15,719
I'm begging you.
Put your hands in here.

430
00:25:25,471 --> 00:25:28,531
Okay. Thank you. Now, who are we?

431
00:25:28,741 --> 00:25:29,765
Mean Machine!

432
00:25:29,976 --> 00:25:32,342
Come on, Mean Machine, let's go!

433
00:25:35,682 --> 00:25:36,944
That's great news.

434
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:39,914
All right. We got ourselves a game.

435
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:41,711
Brown 65. Hut!

436
00:25:41,921 --> 00:25:45,982
<i>First and 10 from the 30.
Crewe finds Deacon open in the flat.</i>

437
00:25:48,094 --> 00:25:49,061
Hut!

438
00:25:50,763 --> 00:25:53,630
<i>The give is to Megget. And he fights
his way for a 9-yard gain.</i>

439
00:25:53,833 --> 00:25:55,528
One yard, baby. One more yard.

440
00:25:56,936 --> 00:25:57,960
Hut! Hut!

441
00:25:58,171 --> 00:26:00,162
<i>Crewe tries a sneak. Or is it?</i>

442
00:26:00,373 --> 00:26:01,840
<i>He flips it back to Megget.</i>

443
00:26:02,342 --> 00:26:05,368
<i>Megget's got the first down
and more.</i>

444
00:26:12,752 --> 00:26:16,711
<i>And Megget is down to the 4-yard
line, where it'll be first and goal.</i>

445
00:26:16,923 --> 00:26:18,015
Hut!

446
00:26:19,058 --> 00:26:22,687
<i>Crewe hands it to Turley.
And look at the big man go.</i>

447
00:26:22,895 --> 00:26:24,123
Tackle him!

448
00:26:29,869 --> 00:26:30,927
<i>Touchdown!</i>

449
00:26:32,038 --> 00:26:36,270
That was some rumbling, bumbling
stumbling right there.

450
00:26:36,476 --> 00:26:38,239
<i>And listen to the crowd</i>

451
00:26:38,444 --> 00:26:42,107
<i>as this underdog con team
is starting to win them over.</i>

452
00:26:50,189 --> 00:26:53,784
<i>Third down and 6. Guards have
the ball on their own 29-yard line.</i>

453
00:26:53,993 --> 00:26:56,461
<i>Knauer needs a first down
to put this game away.</i>

454
00:26:56,662 --> 00:26:58,129
White 50!

455
00:26:58,731 --> 00:26:59,789
White 50!

456
00:26:59,999 --> 00:27:02,160
<i>And look at Battle take off.</i>

457
00:27:03,569 --> 00:27:05,036
<i>He knocks the ball loose!</i>

458
00:27:06,305 --> 00:27:10,867
<i>There's a dogpile in the backfield.
The refs are trying to sort it out.</i>

459
00:27:13,579 --> 00:27:15,206
My arm!

460
00:27:16,082 --> 00:27:18,175
<i>The cons recover!</i>

461
00:27:18,818 --> 00:27:21,651
We got the ball! We got the ball!
We got it! We got it!

462
00:27:22,455 --> 00:27:26,892
With just over two minutes left to be
played, this has turned into a game.

463
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:30,991
<i>Crewe will start in great field position
at the guards' 25.</i>

464
00:27:31,197 --> 00:27:34,792
<i>And look at this formation.
The guards, they're confused.</i>

465
00:27:35,001 --> 00:27:36,059
Shift over! Move!

466
00:27:36,269 --> 00:27:38,533
<i>They're trying to call time-out,
but there's the snap.</i>

467
00:27:42,408 --> 00:27:45,935
<i>Moss is behind a wall of cons. I
wouldn't wanna be in front of that thing.</i>

468
00:27:49,182 --> 00:27:50,581
<i>And they'll score!</i>

469
00:27:55,755 --> 00:27:58,349
- Hey! Is that legal?
- Yeah, it is.

470
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:00,389
- Is that a touchdown?
- Yes, it is.

471
00:28:00,593 --> 00:28:03,460
What is going on here? Shit!

472
00:28:03,963 --> 00:28:07,160
<i>And with the extra point,
the cons are down by just seven.</i>

473
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,938
- Brucie!
- Yeah. Yeah, coach.

474
00:28:17,477 --> 00:28:19,502
I want you to go out there
and kick off.

475
00:28:19,712 --> 00:28:21,612
- I can do it.
- Kick off!

476
00:28:22,048 --> 00:28:23,845
Brucie can't kick worth a shit.

477
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:26,848
I know. Recover the ball.

478
00:28:27,253 --> 00:28:30,120
Jesus Christ, my savior.
If you help me out with this one,

479
00:28:30,323 --> 00:28:33,815
I promise to stop cheating on my wife
with black guys. Amen.

480
00:28:34,026 --> 00:28:36,187
<i>Back in the game is Brucie,
and he'll do the honors.</i>

481
00:28:36,395 --> 00:28:37,987
<i>And it's a horrible kick.</i>

482
00:28:38,197 --> 00:28:39,687
<i>But the ball is tipped!</i>

483
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,125
<i>And the cons have come up with it!</i>

484
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:46,838
- We got it! One time-out.
- Got it. Got it.

485
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:50,475
That's it, Brucie. Hey, hey!
My bad. My bad. My bad. Come on.

486
00:28:51,878 --> 00:28:53,368
Give me that.

487
00:28:54,347 --> 00:28:55,405
Damn...

488
00:28:56,916 --> 00:28:59,180
Well, that felt unnecessary.

489
00:28:59,385 --> 00:29:02,149
<i>Cons have enough time
for one final drive.</i>

490
00:29:03,256 --> 00:29:05,554
<i>Crewe drops back to pass.
He's under pressure.</i>

491
00:29:05,791 --> 00:29:08,385
<i>- Watch the pass!
- He's looking for Deacon.</i>

492
00:29:08,594 --> 00:29:10,323
<i>He gets the ball up, but he's leveled.</i>

493
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:14,128
<i>And Deacon's got it for a first down,
but he stayed inbounds.</i>

494
00:29:14,333 --> 00:29:16,267
<i>Tick, tick, tick.
The clock keeps running.</i>

495
00:29:16,469 --> 00:29:19,461
Clock's running. Clock's still running!
Clock's still running!

496
00:29:19,672 --> 00:29:20,661
On the ball!

497
00:29:20,873 --> 00:29:22,864
Goddamn it! Do something!

498
00:29:23,075 --> 00:29:24,099
Hut!

499
00:29:24,944 --> 00:29:28,141
<i>Crewe. He's looking to throw.
Under pressure again.</i>

500
00:29:28,347 --> 00:29:30,815
Go! Get rid of it! Go! Go!

501
00:29:31,017 --> 00:29:33,212
<i>He pitches it to Megget.
He's got some room.</i>

502
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:36,047
Here we go. Here we go.
Go, Megg! Go, Megget!

503
00:29:36,556 --> 00:29:39,081
- Go, Megget!
- Get him!

504
00:29:39,292 --> 00:29:41,692
<i>He could go all the way!</i>

505
00:29:41,894 --> 00:29:43,122
<i>But he won't!</i>

506
00:29:43,329 --> 00:29:44,421
Goddamn it!

507
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:47,064
<i>And Megget is hit hard
at the 4, and he's hurt.</i>

508
00:29:47,266 --> 00:29:48,631
My knee, man!

509
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:53,803
You busted your knee for us,
we'll bust our ass for you.

510
00:29:54,006 --> 00:29:55,803
Hey, coach, I need a back!

511
00:29:56,008 --> 00:29:57,305
Just win this shit.

512
00:29:59,345 --> 00:30:00,676
I'm going in.

513
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,472
Coach, you serious?

514
00:30:02,682 --> 00:30:04,240
Yeah, I'm serious.

515
00:30:04,517 --> 00:30:07,008
<i>And look who's
coming into the game.</i>

516
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,315
You can do it!

517
00:30:09,522 --> 00:30:12,719
Get that old ass of yours
in the end zone!

518
00:30:12,925 --> 00:30:15,416
We gotta win this thing! Come on!

519
00:30:17,196 --> 00:30:19,960
No, no, no. Hey, old man.

520
00:30:20,166 --> 00:30:22,157
Absolutely not.
You're gonna get killed out here.

521
00:30:22,368 --> 00:30:25,337
They've been trying that for years.
Don't worry, I got the perfect play.

522
00:30:25,538 --> 00:30:27,768
- I ain't handing you the ball.
- You don't have to.

523
00:30:27,974 --> 00:30:31,410
<i>Nate Scarborough, the former
Heisman Trophy winner from 1955,</i>

524
00:30:31,611 --> 00:30:32,805
<i>is gonna play tailback,</i>

525
00:30:33,012 --> 00:30:35,572
<i>but he's gotta be in there more
for moral support than anything.</i>

526
00:30:35,781 --> 00:30:38,579
Mean Machine. Mean Machine.

527
00:30:38,784 --> 00:30:41,548
Mean Machine. Mean Machine.

528
00:30:41,754 --> 00:30:46,088
<i>Mean Machine, Mean Machine
Mean Machine</i>

529
00:30:46,292 --> 00:30:47,657
<i>Mean Machine!</i>

530
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:48,952
<i>Mean Machine!</i>

531
00:30:49,996 --> 00:30:52,658
<i>Six seconds left on the clock.
Cons down by seven.</i>

532
00:30:52,865 --> 00:30:54,856
<i>They must score on this play.</i>

533
00:30:57,336 --> 00:30:58,598
Don't let them through!

534
00:31:00,606 --> 00:31:01,971
Down, set!

535
00:31:02,508 --> 00:31:05,136
- Black 99!
- Come on, D!

536
00:31:05,344 --> 00:31:08,313
Black 99! Hut! Hut!

537
00:31:08,914 --> 00:31:10,711
<i>The give is to the big man, Turley.</i>

538
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:14,708
<i>He's stopped by Lambert
at the line for no gain.</i>

539
00:31:15,354 --> 00:31:16,946
<i>No! Wait!</i>

540
00:31:17,923 --> 00:31:20,721
<i>The ball's picked up
by Scarborough.</i>

541
00:31:23,562 --> 00:31:25,223
Come on!

542
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:32,399
<i>Touchdown!</i>

543
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,811
<i>What an amazing comeback, folks!</i>

544
00:31:43,015 --> 00:31:45,643
<i>Taking a play from
the old Nebraska playbook.</i>

545
00:31:45,851 --> 00:31:46,840
The Fumblerooskie.

546
00:31:47,053 --> 00:31:48,645
Easy. Easy.

547
00:31:48,854 --> 00:31:50,321
You still alive, old man?

548
00:31:51,857 --> 00:31:53,381
Never felt better in my life.

549
00:31:53,592 --> 00:31:55,719
You're a sick bastard. Come here.

550
00:31:56,462 --> 00:31:57,986
All right.

551
00:31:58,197 --> 00:32:02,429
And now the cons are a mere
extra point away from overtime.

552
00:32:02,635 --> 00:32:04,068
Mean Machine!

553
00:32:07,573 --> 00:32:10,940
Team vote: We go for the win?
We go for the tie?

554
00:32:11,143 --> 00:32:14,510
Hell, guys, we're convicts.
We always go for it all.

555
00:32:15,047 --> 00:32:18,847
Unfortunately, that's why
we're all in the joint.

556
00:32:19,285 --> 00:32:20,513
What would Caretaker do?

557
00:32:22,321 --> 00:32:23,618
Give me that blackboard.

558
00:32:23,956 --> 00:32:25,014
Yeah, come on!

559
00:32:25,758 --> 00:32:26,725
Come on.

560
00:32:29,261 --> 00:32:30,421
Are you serious?

561
00:32:30,629 --> 00:32:32,290
I don't know. That play is wack.

562
00:32:32,498 --> 00:32:33,556
It's gonna work.

563
00:32:34,834 --> 00:32:37,029
It's gonna work. Let's go. On the ball.

564
00:32:37,236 --> 00:32:38,225
Come on! Let's go!

565
00:32:38,437 --> 00:32:40,428
Let's go, y'all! Let's go!

566
00:32:40,639 --> 00:32:42,266
I think it's gonna work.

567
00:32:43,375 --> 00:32:45,104
Get them out there.

568
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:50,740
<i>And wait a minute.
Crewe is coming back into the game.</i>

569
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:52,747
<i>The cons are gonna go for the win.</i>

570
00:32:52,952 --> 00:32:54,010
They're going for it.

571
00:32:55,287 --> 00:32:58,381
<i>Crewe, trying to settle his team
into formation.</i>

572
00:32:58,591 --> 00:33:00,491
<i>But there seems to be
a lot of confusion.</i>

573
00:33:00,693 --> 00:33:02,388
Come on! Run the play!

574
00:33:02,595 --> 00:33:04,927
Turley! Turley. Over here.

575
00:33:05,131 --> 00:33:07,725
Move your giant ass right here!
Right here.

576
00:33:07,933 --> 00:33:09,730
Come on, baby. Come on.

577
00:33:11,137 --> 00:33:14,368
<i>The play clock is still running.
Crewe better call a time-out.</i>

578
00:33:14,573 --> 00:33:15,540
Come on, Crewe!

579
00:33:17,543 --> 00:33:19,374
They don't know what we're doing!

580
00:33:19,578 --> 00:33:21,136
Run the play we set up.

581
00:33:21,347 --> 00:33:23,611
I think you're still dizzy from that hit!

582
00:33:24,617 --> 00:33:26,585
<i>The snap is to Deacon.</i>

583
00:33:26,786 --> 00:33:28,117
It's a trick.

584
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,345
<i>He throws it to Crewe.</i>

585
00:33:53,879 --> 00:33:56,074
<i>They did it! Unbelievable!</i>

586
00:33:56,282 --> 00:33:57,749
<i>The cons win!</i>

587
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:12,661
We win!

588
00:34:12,865 --> 00:34:15,766
Group hug in the shower tonight!

589
00:34:17,803 --> 00:34:20,033
Or not. Or not.

590
00:34:22,141 --> 00:34:23,438
<i>Well, there you have it.</i>

591
00:34:23,642 --> 00:34:25,837
<i>A bunch of ruthless criminals
have beaten</i>

592
00:34:26,045 --> 00:34:28,605
<i>the men that uphold
our justice system.</i>

593
00:34:28,814 --> 00:34:30,782
Criminals are people too, Chris.

594
00:34:30,983 --> 00:34:32,314
Now, give me your wallet.

595
00:34:32,918 --> 00:34:33,907
What?

596
00:34:34,386 --> 00:34:36,047
Just kidding.

597
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:43,925
You got a lot of balls, Crewe.
You played a hell of a game.

598
00:34:44,129 --> 00:34:47,963
And don't worry, I know you had
nothing to do with Caretaker's murder.

599
00:34:48,167 --> 00:34:49,259
And I'll back that up.

600
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:52,469
Thank you, baby.

601
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:56,664
<i>Mean Machine! Mean Machine!</i>

602
00:34:59,745 --> 00:35:04,273
You humiliated me. I can't believe
you couldn't even win a fixed game.

603
00:35:06,852 --> 00:35:09,320
Now, where the hell
does he think he's going?

604
00:35:12,825 --> 00:35:14,019
He's escaping.

605
00:35:14,426 --> 00:35:15,552
He's escaping.

606
00:35:15,761 --> 00:35:17,854
Officer, shoot that man!

607
00:35:18,063 --> 00:35:19,860
But, sir, there's people.

608
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,658
Shoot him.

609
00:35:23,636 --> 00:35:24,660
Crewe!

610
00:35:25,371 --> 00:35:27,965
Captain, I order you
to shoot that prisoner.

611
00:35:31,243 --> 00:35:33,268
Shoot him! Fire!

612
00:35:33,479 --> 00:35:34,810
Crewe!

613
00:35:35,014 --> 00:35:37,949
Damn it, I'm giving you an order,
captain!

614
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,117
Crewe!

615
00:35:39,318 --> 00:35:41,115
Pull the trigger!

616
00:36:00,472 --> 00:36:02,736
It's the game ball.

617
00:36:09,682 --> 00:36:10,774
Hey.

618
00:36:14,687 --> 00:36:17,622
Why don't you stick this
in your trophy case.

619
00:36:19,692 --> 00:36:21,922
- You have a nice time, old man?
- Yeah.

620
00:36:22,127 --> 00:36:24,994
Yeah? Okay.
So, what do we do now?

621
00:36:25,197 --> 00:36:27,825
Well, the first thing is, we tell the
team where they're hiding Unger.

622
00:36:28,033 --> 00:36:31,469
Oh, I can't wait to see
what Switowski does to him.

623
00:36:38,344 --> 00:36:39,834
Great game, sir.

624
00:36:42,715 --> 00:36:44,205
That's a week in the hotbox!

625
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:46,281
Who gives a shit?
