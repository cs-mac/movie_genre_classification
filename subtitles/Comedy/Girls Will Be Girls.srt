1
00:02:32,621 --> 00:02:34,851
Fuu...

2
00:02:37,998 --> 00:02:40,899
...uuck!

3
00:03:20,751 --> 00:03:22,616
Hello, gorgeous.

4
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,978
Jesus.

5
00:03:41,008 --> 00:03:43,636
I wish someone could
tell me how to just once

6
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,864
wake up without
a splitting headache.

7
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,330
You could drink less.

8
00:03:47,344 --> 00:03:50,313
Thank you, Coco.
That's very helpful.

9
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:56,063
Place looks nice.

10
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,516
Yes. We were both getting up
early to clean it today, remember?

11
00:03:59,441 --> 00:04:01,534
I'd have just gotten in the way.

12
00:04:01,521 --> 00:04:04,922
You did get in the way.
That's why I moved you to your bed.

13
00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:06,146
Evie.

14
00:04:11,857 --> 00:04:12,881
Yeah?

15
00:04:13,938 --> 00:04:16,805
What do you think about the idea
of having a dog in the house?

16
00:04:16,753 --> 00:04:19,620
I'm sorry.
Have I been staring?

17
00:04:20,658 --> 00:04:22,148
I'm thinking of getting one.

18
00:04:22,149 --> 00:04:23,149
I mean, let's face it,

19
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:25,757
at this point, I'm probably
never gonna have kids.

20
00:04:25,681 --> 00:04:29,139
Coco, it's not too late.

21
00:04:29,074 --> 00:04:30,132
I'm kidding!

22
00:04:30,962 --> 00:04:32,361
A dog sounds fun.

23
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:35,100
It sounds depressing,
is what it sounds.

24
00:04:35,058 --> 00:04:36,491
"Do you have kids?"

25
00:04:36,498 --> 00:04:37,988
"No, but I have a dog".

26
00:04:38,003 --> 00:04:41,404
"Well, it's the same thing,
you crazy, barren old hag".

27
00:04:41,331 --> 00:04:44,061
This new roommate
will cheer you right up.

28
00:04:44,018 --> 00:04:46,350
I just hope
she's not too loud.

29
00:04:46,323 --> 00:04:47,483
Or happy.

30
00:04:47,506 --> 00:04:49,804
Happy people
always make such a racket.

31
00:04:49,778 --> 00:04:52,338
Coco she came by
and she was a peach.

32
00:04:52,307 --> 00:04:54,798
- Were you drunk?
- It was 12 noon.

33
00:04:54,771 --> 00:04:56,534
Of course I was drunk.

34
00:04:56,531 --> 00:05:00,023
I'm surprised anybody would wanna rent
that awful Bicentennial room.

35
00:05:02,292 --> 00:05:03,554
What?

36
00:05:03,572 --> 00:05:05,631
I rented Varla your room.

37
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,111
- What?
- So you'll be the one in the...

38
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,372
...in the Bicentennial room.

39
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:14,178
Evie, I have seniority.

40
00:05:14,132 --> 00:05:15,360
Bet that's her.

41
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:18,076
All you do
is take advantage of me.

42
00:05:18,036 --> 00:05:20,300
And I'm not gonna
take it anymore.

43
00:05:23,796 --> 00:05:26,390
Ooh, she's a happy one.

44
00:05:26,357 --> 00:05:29,121
Hello! You must be Yoo Hoo.

45
00:05:29,077 --> 00:05:30,169
Coco.

46
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:32,791
- I'm Varla.
- Hello, Varla.

47
00:05:32,757 --> 00:05:35,021
Let me help you
with your duffel bag.

48
00:05:36,757 --> 00:05:38,520
My things are in the Cabriolet.

49
00:05:38,517 --> 00:05:42,283
Oh, I'm sorry.
That's just your ass.

50
00:05:50,261 --> 00:05:52,286
Jesus Christ!

51
00:05:53,238 --> 00:05:55,900
Well, this is the backyard.

52
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:58,831
You have a pool?

53
00:06:00,854 --> 00:06:04,312
Nothing like that first
puke of the day! Martini?

54
00:06:04,246 --> 00:06:06,874
Happy hour for me
never starts till after five.

55
00:06:06,838 --> 00:06:09,534
Me either.
This is only number three.

56
00:06:10,294 --> 00:06:15,061
Varla was just telling me all about
how she came here from Arkansas.

57
00:06:14,934 --> 00:06:17,027
Right. To become
a big movie star.

58
00:06:17,015 --> 00:06:18,710
And singing sensation.

59
00:06:19,767 --> 00:06:22,668
Well, you know, it's not
as simple as just showing up.

60
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:24,810
You also have to
fill out the application.

61
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:29,655
I realize how tough it can be.
But that's why I have a plan.

62
00:06:30,007 --> 00:06:33,135
I'm gonna spend every afternoon
at Schwab's Drugstore.

63
00:06:33,496 --> 00:06:36,897
You know, where
Tina Turner was discovered.

64
00:06:37,559 --> 00:06:40,119
Except it's
a Virgin Megastore now.

65
00:06:40,087 --> 00:06:41,816
Are people
still discovered there?

66
00:06:41,816 --> 00:06:44,785
Yes, but mainly in the men's room
by undercover cops.

67
00:06:44,728 --> 00:06:46,958
You know,
her plan could work.

68
00:06:46,936 --> 00:06:48,733
When I was first starting out,

69
00:06:48,728 --> 00:06:51,288
I ran into Fred MacMurray
at the Brown Derby

70
00:06:51,256 --> 00:06:53,588
just when they were
casting Flubber.

71
00:06:53,561 --> 00:06:57,395
We hit it off so well,
he threw a juicy part my way.

72
00:06:57,305 --> 00:06:59,068
Then he put you
in the movie.

73
00:06:59,065 --> 00:07:03,365
Well, I hate to brag,
but acting is sort of in my blood.

74
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:06,784
You see,
my mother was Marla Simonds.

75
00:07:07,865 --> 00:07:09,833
- 'Cause of her!
- I can't finish this.

76
00:07:11,289 --> 00:07:13,348
Your mother
was Marla Simonds?

77
00:07:13,337 --> 00:07:14,702
Chesty on Fill Her Up.

78
00:07:14,713 --> 00:07:17,773
The short-lived but widely acclaimed
summer spin-off of CPO Sharrkey.

79
00:07:17,722 --> 00:07:19,622
Damn it.
That was a lot of martini.

80
00:07:19,609 --> 00:07:22,601
- Did you know her?
- Goodness, yes.

81
00:07:22,554 --> 00:07:25,853
We were always running
into each other at auditions.

82
00:07:25,786 --> 00:07:28,186
She had such
a bright future, too.

83
00:07:28,154 --> 00:07:31,021
We were all so shocked
when she offed herself.

84
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:32,767
- Evie!
- I'm sorry.

85
00:07:32,762 --> 00:07:34,286
Passed herself away.

86
00:07:35,738 --> 00:07:38,502
They shipped me off
to Arkansas right after, so I...

87
00:07:39,995 --> 00:07:41,519
I have so many questions.

88
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,464
- What was she like?
- Very sweet.

89
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:46,044
- And a big pothead.
- Evie!

90
00:07:46,011 --> 00:07:47,569
Loved cock.
- Evie!

91
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:49,479
Coco is sexophobic.

92
00:07:49,466 --> 00:07:53,027
- Did you ever work with her?
- No, but you know what?

93
00:07:52,955 --> 00:07:55,788
She almost got my
breakthrough role in Asteroid.

94
00:07:56,283 --> 00:07:58,513
Still, there were never
any hard feelings.

95
00:07:58,491 --> 00:08:01,324
She even came to the big
housewarming party I threw

96
00:08:01,276 --> 00:08:04,006
after the premiere to help my friends
celebrate my success.

97
00:08:09,212 --> 00:08:12,648
My mother... was here?

98
00:08:12,572 --> 00:08:14,301
Everyone was.

99
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,098
Marla, Rip Taylor...
everyone.

100
00:08:17,468 --> 00:08:19,197
You know what?

101
00:08:20,348 --> 00:08:22,942
I think the universe
sent me here for a reason.

102
00:08:22,908 --> 00:08:27,572
It's telling me I'm supposed to
follow in my mother's footsteps.

103
00:08:28,732 --> 00:08:30,859
If I can become
a big movie star,

104
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:35,713
then maybe in a way, her life
wouldn't have been for nothing.

105
00:08:36,765 --> 00:08:38,062
How do you figure?

106
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,137
Piece of shit.

107
00:09:05,534 --> 00:09:07,798
Evie, help!

108
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:25,799
Hi.

109
00:09:25,823 --> 00:09:28,656
I didn't realize you knew
this room still existed.

110
00:09:28,607 --> 00:09:30,837
I come in here plenty.

111
00:09:31,615 --> 00:09:32,707
Look.

112
00:09:32,736 --> 00:09:36,832
Cher Allman decided
to drop her last name altogether.

113
00:09:36,735 --> 00:09:40,034
Well, with that new girl in the house,
I've got to keep up.

114
00:09:39,967 --> 00:09:43,198
Three hours in,
and you're already competing.

115
00:09:43,136 --> 00:09:46,162
- Just like with her mom.
- That's not what this is!

116
00:09:46,112 --> 00:09:47,841
Oh, my God!

117
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:28,746
What?

118
00:10:30,658 --> 00:10:34,788
Oh, Evie,
when I was at Vassar,

119
00:10:34,689 --> 00:10:39,023
I became... with child...

120
00:10:38,914 --> 00:10:40,245
and I had a...

121
00:10:41,154 --> 00:10:42,815
...procedure.

122
00:10:43,394 --> 00:10:46,989
Tlhat's your big secret?
An abortion?

123
00:10:46,914 --> 00:10:49,542
- Have you had one?
- One?

124
00:10:49,506 --> 00:10:53,499
I've had more children pulled
out of me than a burning orphanage.

125
00:10:53,859 --> 00:10:57,556
Well, anyway, there's more.

126
00:11:02,499 --> 00:11:04,524
I was still
very young myself,

127
00:11:04,515 --> 00:11:08,042
so, needless to say,
I was quite nervous.

128
00:11:07,972 --> 00:11:09,371
But, Evie,

129
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:13,476
when that doctor walked in,
my fear melted like...

130
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,678
snow in a... melter.

131
00:11:15,652 --> 00:11:17,381
So, is this your first abortion?

132
00:11:18,692 --> 00:11:19,852
Yeah.

133
00:11:19,876 --> 00:11:22,037
He was confident and kind...

134
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,647
There you go.

135
00:11:23,652 --> 00:11:26,553
- And I know this souds crazy...
- Yeah, hold still.

136
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,196
...but even
in our brief time together.

137
00:11:29,156 --> 00:11:30,919
I felt our souls touch.

138
00:11:30,917 --> 00:11:32,748
It's over?

139
00:11:32,741 --> 00:11:34,868
Afterwards.
I tried to make contact.

140
00:11:34,853 --> 00:11:37,788
But they didn't give out doctor's names
on account of all the shootings.

141
00:11:37,733 --> 00:11:40,167
I must have the doctor's name!

142
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:44,228
All I knew was
he worked on Tuesdays.

143
00:11:44,933 --> 00:11:46,525
- And. Evie...
- Young man.

144
00:11:46,533 --> 00:11:49,093
...that's when I hatched
my evil plan.

145
00:11:49,062 --> 00:11:52,361
- You're on the pill, right?
- Of course I am.

146
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:53,921
Think I want
to get pregnant?

147
00:11:53,925 --> 00:11:55,722
I took on all comers

148
00:11:55,718 --> 00:11:57,913
classmates, teachers...

149
00:11:57,894 --> 00:11:59,953
- ... my priest.
- You're going straight to hell!

150
00:11:59,941 --> 00:12:02,842
My reputation went
into a tailspin, but I didn't care.

151
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:05,418
I was a woman obsessed.

152
00:12:05,382 --> 00:12:08,943
Then one morning,
a Tuesday if you believe in fate...

153
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:12,601
I ran to that clinic so fast
I'm lucky I didn't miscarry.

154
00:12:12,518 --> 00:12:14,486
Time had only made him
more handsome.

155
00:12:14,471 --> 00:12:16,803
Look who it is.
My favorite patient.

156
00:12:16,774 --> 00:12:18,503
I smiled at him.

157
00:12:18,503 --> 00:12:19,902
He smiled back.

158
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:22,344
And Evie,
that's when I saw it.

159
00:12:22,311 --> 00:12:23,869
He had gotten married.

160
00:12:23,878 --> 00:12:25,004
What's wrong?

161
00:12:25,031 --> 00:12:26,760
- I was so distraught.
- Nothing.

162
00:12:26,758 --> 00:12:28,521
I couldn't even enjoy
our intimacy.

163
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:29,850
Here I come.

164
00:12:31,623 --> 00:12:33,523
I'm not proud
of what I did.

165
00:12:34,311 --> 00:12:37,747
In fact, I haven't slept
through a night since.

166
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:41,066
But when I do sleep...

167
00:12:43,432 --> 00:12:44,865
...I dream of him.

168
00:13:05,801 --> 00:13:07,735
I'll bring the rest
when you finish with that.

169
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:08,915
Stay close.

170
00:13:14,441 --> 00:13:19,071
I saw you sitting all alone,
looking so very beautiful.

171
00:13:18,953 --> 00:13:20,477
Thank you.

172
00:13:21,897 --> 00:13:24,058
My apology
for being so bold,

173
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:28,205
but when I see the best,
I have to have it.

174
00:13:28,105 --> 00:13:30,266
Well, you know...

175
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:33,083
a Maserati needs much more
pampering than a Toyota.

176
00:13:33,034 --> 00:13:34,729
This is not a problem

177
00:13:34,729 --> 00:13:38,790
if the Maserati will take
its driver where he wants to go.

178
00:13:38,698 --> 00:13:41,599
Maseratis don't do anal.

179
00:13:41,546 --> 00:13:43,878
I think we understand each other.

180
00:13:44,842 --> 00:13:48,073
So, what brings you lunching
this afternoon?

181
00:13:49,259 --> 00:13:52,660
It's not the exact malt shop
where Tina Turner was discovered

182
00:13:52,587 --> 00:13:56,182
by a big producer,
but it is the closest one to it...

183
00:13:56,587 --> 00:13:58,020
...that had apple crumble.

184
00:13:58,955 --> 00:14:03,324
Do you know that I,
I am movie producer?

185
00:14:06,155 --> 00:14:07,281
Really?

186
00:14:10,988 --> 00:14:15,584
Where on earth did you
produce that charming accent?

187
00:14:15,467 --> 00:14:17,059
Bulgrapulatvinskerbina.

188
00:14:17,067 --> 00:14:18,159
Waiter!

189
00:14:21,196 --> 00:14:25,155
Yes, Bulgrapulatvinskerbinians,
we do not bathe.

190
00:14:25,068 --> 00:14:26,626
Can't tell.

191
00:14:26,636 --> 00:14:30,766
But that does remind me,
I really should refreshen my perfume.

192
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,458
So I said, "Why am I laughing?

193
00:14:35,468 --> 00:14:38,403
We're doing it doggy style,
and your name is Barker".

194
00:14:39,949 --> 00:14:43,043
That used to be
George Peppard's house.

195
00:14:42,988 --> 00:14:44,421
Great lay.

196
00:14:44,429 --> 00:14:47,626
But talk about loud,
they knew he was coming in Oxnard.

197
00:14:47,565 --> 00:14:49,157
Evie, I'm not sure about this.

198
00:14:49,165 --> 00:14:51,929
Coco, I've done this
a million times.

199
00:14:51,885 --> 00:14:54,319
- This sounds dangerous.
- Dangerous?

200
00:14:54,285 --> 00:14:56,719
Coco, I slam on the brakes,

201
00:14:56,685 --> 00:14:58,619
the poor sap
behind us doesn't,

202
00:14:58,605 --> 00:15:00,368
then this quack I know
says we're injured,

203
00:15:00,365 --> 00:15:03,630
and my ambulance-chaser son
sues them for all they're worth!

204
00:15:03,565 --> 00:15:07,160
- It's like stealing money!
- It is stealing money.

205
00:15:07,693 --> 00:15:09,558
June Allyson.

206
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,916
They offered me
that commercial for Depends.

207
00:15:11,885 --> 00:15:13,375
Lot of money, too.

208
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:16,382
Just one little problem,
I don't shit my pants.

209
00:15:16,334 --> 00:15:19,599
Plus, I want to show Poppy
his new home.

210
00:15:20,623 --> 00:15:22,113
Jackpot!

211
00:15:28,687 --> 00:15:31,656
And at the time of the accident,
had you been drinking?

212
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,156
No. I was sober.

213
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:36,568
- Ma, this guy's lawyer's gonna ask me...
- Fine! I hadn't been drinking.

214
00:15:36,495 --> 00:15:37,792
Not even one drink?

215
00:15:37,807 --> 00:15:39,968
One drink? What's that?

216
00:15:41,392 --> 00:15:42,916
Ok I'm gonna go start with Coco.

217
00:15:42,927 --> 00:15:45,657
They kept her overnight
at the hospital.

218
00:15:46,447 --> 00:15:49,746
- Is she gonna be okay?
- I hope so.

219
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,671
Do we get more if she dies?

220
00:15:51,663 --> 00:15:54,757
Mom! Aunt Coco is my favorite

221
00:15:59,536 --> 00:16:00,969
Hi.

222
00:16:03,024 --> 00:16:04,389
Varla.

223
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,392
Varla!
This is my son...

224
00:16:07,344 --> 00:16:08,709
Stevie.

225
00:16:08,721 --> 00:16:10,484
- Hello, Stevie.
- Hi, Varla.

226
00:16:10,481 --> 00:16:14,144
That's a pretty name
for a pretty girl.

227
00:16:14,065 --> 00:16:16,590
It's also kind of a fat name.

228
00:16:16,561 --> 00:16:18,461
Which is good, too.

229
00:16:18,449 --> 00:16:20,349
I'm glad I'm pretty,

230
00:16:20,337 --> 00:16:23,363
because I'm taking
a big producer to dinner tonight.

231
00:16:23,313 --> 00:16:26,373
Maybe I'll go
on a date tonight, too.

232
00:16:26,321 --> 00:16:28,414
That guy who hit us
slipped me his number.

233
00:16:29,297 --> 00:16:31,993
He had to, Mom.
It's the law.

234
00:16:31,954 --> 00:16:35,219
Well, did he have to flirt with me
while we waited for the cops?

235
00:16:35,729 --> 00:16:38,698
He said, "Look the fuck
where you're going,

236
00:16:38,642 --> 00:16:40,041
you drunk corpse."

237
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:42,280
It was more
in his body language.

238
00:16:45,426 --> 00:16:48,293
So, I know I'm not
a big-shot producer or anything,

239
00:16:48,243 --> 00:16:50,541
but I get jobs
for Mom sometimes.

240
00:16:50,515 --> 00:16:51,675
I don't know why you bother.

241
00:16:51,698 --> 00:16:54,428
They all run screaming
when they see your tiny dick.

242
00:16:57,042 --> 00:16:59,067
- Mom!
- What, it's not?

243
00:16:59,058 --> 00:17:01,993
The doctor changed his mind twice
before calling him a boy.

244
00:17:03,347 --> 00:17:07,010
When it comes to men,
I look for what's on the inside.

245
00:17:06,931 --> 00:17:09,126
Then you're in luck,
'cause his dick practically is.

246
00:17:09,107 --> 00:17:10,267
Hi, Jeff!

247
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:12,486
You rammed into me today,
and I want seconds.

248
00:17:25,876 --> 00:17:29,505
Why are you doing
so far from me?

249
00:17:29,428 --> 00:17:30,918
Be closer.

250
00:17:42,772 --> 00:17:46,572
Oh, yes,
this is much more romantic.

251
00:17:50,581 --> 00:17:54,483
You see that girl at the bar?
She's a whore.

252
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:58,664
How can you tell?

253
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:01,977
Whores are sexy.
Do you know why?

254
00:18:02,806 --> 00:18:04,239
Because it's their job?

255
00:18:04,245 --> 00:18:08,238
Because they do it for love.

256
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:11,017
Tonight she is going to give
all the money she make

257
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:14,298
to one most very important man.

258
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:17,063
Right, or he'll cut her.

259
00:18:17,014 --> 00:18:19,141
Also to prove that she cares.

260
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:21,097
As a producer,

261
00:18:21,111 --> 00:18:23,978
I have many actress,
they tell me that they care.

262
00:18:23,926 --> 00:18:28,795
But a whore...
A whore prove it.

263
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,241
Laurent...

264
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:34,502
I care.

265
00:18:34,487 --> 00:18:36,580
And would you like to prove?

266
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:39,353
Heavens, yes.

267
00:18:40,055 --> 00:18:43,047
More than I'd like to finish
those Bob Hope Nachos.

268
00:18:42,999 --> 00:18:46,298
I think we understand each other.

269
00:18:48,344 --> 00:18:49,641
Waitress!

270
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,536
I'm glad
I could coax you over.

271
00:18:56,439 --> 00:19:00,136
At first I was afraid
you'd think it a bit strange.

272
00:19:01,176 --> 00:19:02,905
Why, 'cause you're so old?

273
00:19:03,448 --> 00:19:06,383
'Cause of how we met,
silly-billy.

274
00:19:06,328 --> 00:19:09,195
- What's this?
- Let me turn it on.

275
00:19:09,144 --> 00:19:11,578
I love turning things on.

276
00:19:19,384 --> 00:19:22,512
- It's raining!
- Nice.

277
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:25,857
I'll sell it to you for $5,000.

278
00:19:25,817 --> 00:19:27,079
That's okay.

279
00:19:27,097 --> 00:19:30,328
I'm kidding. I could never
part with it anyway...

280
00:19:30,265 --> 00:19:32,426
for less than 3,500 rock bottom.

281
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:36,039
- You know Mary Tyler Moore?
- Very well.

282
00:19:35,961 --> 00:19:38,691
We did Night of
a Thousand Stars together.

283
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:41,483
Funny story,
she has diabetes.

284
00:19:41,434 --> 00:19:45,700
It's always been sort of a fantasy
of mine to sleep with a big movie star.

285
00:19:45,594 --> 00:19:50,258
Well, tonight might just be
the night your fantasy comes true.

286
00:19:50,138 --> 00:19:52,106
Why? Who's coming?

287
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,580
Me.

288
00:19:53,594 --> 00:19:55,186
Asteroid.

289
00:19:56,218 --> 00:19:59,119
- I'm sorry, I didn't see it.
- Oh, you're the one.

290
00:19:59,546 --> 00:20:00,706
I'm kidding.

291
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:02,595
- But Battlestar Galactica.
- No.

292
00:20:02,586 --> 00:20:04,611
- The Facts of Life go to Europe?
- No.

293
00:20:04,602 --> 00:20:05,694
Tabitha!

294
00:20:05,722 --> 00:20:09,453
You know I just realized,
tonight is my laundry night!

295
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:14,633
Court TV.: Celebrities Who Kill.

296
00:20:15,259 --> 00:20:17,659
You're the Hit-and-Run
Hooch Hound!

297
00:20:20,571 --> 00:20:23,199
Cleanup in ICU.

298
00:20:25,244 --> 00:20:26,404
Hello.

299
00:20:27,004 --> 00:20:30,804
Hi. You gave us
quite a scare there...

300
00:20:30,716 --> 00:20:31,876
Coco.

301
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,060
What happened?

302
00:20:33,084 --> 00:20:35,211
All I remember is this truck-

303
00:20:35,196 --> 00:20:36,629
Poppy!

304
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:38,194
I'm sorry.

305
00:20:38,716 --> 00:20:39,876
He's gone?

306
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,596
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

307
00:20:42,556 --> 00:20:44,319
Didn't you get your morphine?

308
00:20:44,316 --> 00:20:48,218
No. But in fairness,
the nurse seemed really sleepy.

309
00:20:51,677 --> 00:20:55,272
Which is just as well, really,
'cause I usually don't take such strong-

310
00:20:55,197 --> 00:20:58,496
Trust me.
It's the pizza of drugs.

311
00:21:14,014 --> 00:21:16,073
Dr. Perfect?

312
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:25,031
Patient Beautiful.

313
00:21:25,022 --> 00:21:27,149
Five bucks. Make it last.

314
00:21:27,134 --> 00:21:29,125
Thank you, sir.

315
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:31,952
My pimp and I
appreciate your business.

316
00:21:40,095 --> 00:21:41,255
So-

317
00:21:42,015 --> 00:21:44,347
Okay, enough child's play.

318
00:21:48,703 --> 00:21:50,568
Do you got any porn?

319
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,693
Maybe, left over
from my husband.

320
00:21:54,623 --> 00:21:57,421
Could we, for a goof?

321
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:00,402
Okay. It'll be
kind of old, though.

322
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:01,512
That's fine.

323
00:22:01,536 --> 00:22:04,403
- And man-on-man.
- Anything.

324
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,310
I wanted to look for you,

325
00:22:08,288 --> 00:22:11,451
but I was afraid you'd
reject me when you heard.

326
00:22:11,392 --> 00:22:12,825
Heard what?

327
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:15,631
When I fall for a woman,

328
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:18,144
I become her
emotional slave.

329
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:20,770
I'll manage.

330
00:22:35,393 --> 00:22:39,124
God. I had hoped
you'd be a lifeless kisser.

331
00:22:39,618 --> 00:22:42,143
And in a few years,
when your ass begins to sag-

332
00:22:42,113 --> 00:22:45,742
But, Dr. Perfect,
it's sagging now.

333
00:22:46,786 --> 00:22:48,014
No.

334
00:22:59,138 --> 00:23:01,800
She's famous, she's famous...

335
00:23:04,834 --> 00:23:08,133
What's wrong?
Did my glass eye roll back?

336
00:23:08,066 --> 00:23:09,431
I'll fix it.

337
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:13,300
Oh, yeah.

338
00:23:14,915 --> 00:23:16,075
She's famous.

339
00:23:17,251 --> 00:23:18,843
Oh, yeah!

340
00:23:31,396 --> 00:23:35,298
"Miss Harris, my drinking has been
spinning out of control lately.

341
00:23:35,203 --> 00:23:39,230
"But last night made me realize
I've hit bottom and need help.

342
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,732
Tlhank you. Jeff. "

343
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:43,903
It feels so good
to make a difference.

344
00:23:46,917 --> 00:23:49,784
Evie! You promised to pick me up
at the hospital.

345
00:23:49,733 --> 00:23:52,998
I know, but I really
needed the extra sleep.

346
00:23:52,933 --> 00:23:56,960
No, I believe the phrase
you're searching for is "I'm sorry".

347
00:23:56,869 --> 00:23:58,734
You're the one
who believed me.

348
00:23:58,735 --> 00:23:59,735
Evie?

349
00:24:18,438 --> 00:24:20,303
Have you ever been on morphine?

350
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:24,418
Once, when I had my eyes done.

351
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:27,188
Then every day
for ten years after that. Why?

352
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:30,722
It's too horible to talk about.

353
00:24:34,374 --> 00:24:37,002
- I'm in love!
- My date went great, too.

354
00:24:38,566 --> 00:24:40,124
What's wrong?

355
00:24:40,134 --> 00:24:43,570
It's too horrible
to talk about, thank God.

356
00:24:43,495 --> 00:24:45,861
Laurent is charming

357
00:24:45,831 --> 00:24:47,025
and handsome

358
00:24:47,047 --> 00:24:48,878
and sexy.

359
00:24:49,639 --> 00:24:53,370
And he really makes me feel
like I'm worth something.

360
00:24:53,287 --> 00:24:55,084
That stain is from us.

361
00:24:56,136 --> 00:25:00,698
Plus, he is going to give me a role
in his new feature film!

362
00:25:01,511 --> 00:25:03,342
Congratu...

363
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:06,130
I love you. I love you.

364
00:25:06,151 --> 00:25:09,177
Phooey! I'm late
for our love game.

365
00:25:09,128 --> 00:25:11,323
Take these for the ride,
you huge cow.

366
00:25:12,104 --> 00:25:13,162
Excuse me?

367
00:25:13,192 --> 00:25:14,989
I'm kidding.

368
00:25:14,984 --> 00:25:16,315
Jesus.

369
00:25:21,672 --> 00:25:23,333
Here you go, pimpleton.

370
00:25:23,336 --> 00:25:24,598
It would have been more,

371
00:25:24,617 --> 00:25:26,642
but that football team
beat me and ran.

372
00:25:26,632 --> 00:25:28,122
Get back out there.

373
00:25:28,136 --> 00:25:30,229
But I'm so sore already.

374
00:25:30,217 --> 00:25:33,653
Like my heart is sore
when you are away from me.

375
00:25:33,577 --> 00:25:36,444
Laurent, you should write
paper towels.

376
00:25:36,393 --> 00:25:37,690
Varla, you're coming with me.

377
00:25:37,705 --> 00:25:39,502
This is none
of your concern, my friend.

378
00:25:39,498 --> 00:25:40,931
I'm not your friend, pal.

379
00:25:40,937 --> 00:25:44,100
Stevie, Laurent and I are
just playing a love game.

380
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:46,704
I make $1,000, and then he
puts me in his feature film.

381
00:25:46,666 --> 00:25:48,998
Don't you see
what's going on here?

382
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:52,167
This ass-wipe is a con man,
and he's turned you into a whore.

383
00:25:52,106 --> 00:25:54,836
If you could hear yourself
speak right now.

384
00:25:54,794 --> 00:25:56,762
Loved blowing you.
Thanks for the tip.

385
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:02,315
Okay, fine.
You need $1,000?

386
00:26:02,666 --> 00:26:04,691
Here. Here's...

387
00:26:05,546 --> 00:26:06,706
420.

388
00:26:07,627 --> 00:26:09,720
I'm still a C and a fin-saw short.

389
00:26:10,859 --> 00:26:12,417
That's all I've got.

390
00:26:13,899 --> 00:26:15,457
Your shoes look new.

391
00:26:23,595 --> 00:26:27,087
There, Laurent.
I don't see any cameras.

392
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:30,480
Yes, hello.
Thank you. Good-bye.

393
00:26:30,443 --> 00:26:32,468
The film, it was canceled.

394
00:26:32,469 --> 00:26:33,469
Varla...

395
00:26:45,612 --> 00:26:48,672
There's some people out there
you just gotta watch out for.

396
00:26:49,581 --> 00:26:52,141
I'm starting to see that now.

397
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:56,712
I guess I never had anybody
to show me who they are.

398
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,247
Well, you do now.

399
00:26:59,565 --> 00:27:02,329
I know what it's like
to grow up without a mom.

400
00:27:19,213 --> 00:27:20,874
Don't you listen to her, either.

401
00:27:20,877 --> 00:27:23,903
You're a man
because of what's in here,

402
00:27:23,853 --> 00:27:25,286
not in...

403
00:27:27,662 --> 00:27:29,061
Down a little.

404
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:32,437
To the left. Now up.
You went past it.

405
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:34,068
...here.

406
00:27:34,095 --> 00:27:37,326
Go back a little more.
More. Stop.

407
00:27:37,966 --> 00:27:39,160
There.

408
00:27:40,686 --> 00:27:42,051
Really?

409
00:27:42,511 --> 00:27:44,103
Press down.

410
00:27:45,903 --> 00:27:48,463
Try short of rolling your fingers
back and forth a little bit.

411
00:27:58,544 --> 00:28:02,640
I'm sure when it's firm...

412
00:28:05,104 --> 00:28:07,698
Well, it kind of-

413
00:28:07,663 --> 00:28:11,827
So, listen, how about
tomorow night I take you out

414
00:28:11,728 --> 00:28:15,323
for a great big steak dinner?

415
00:28:16,368 --> 00:28:19,030
Your mom is my roommate.

416
00:28:22,256 --> 00:28:23,416
Sure.

417
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,317
Okay.

418
00:28:25,873 --> 00:28:28,569
But thanks
for the money and the shoes.

419
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,811
If you're like me,

420
00:28:35,825 --> 00:28:38,555
your days are
jam-packed with activity.

421
00:28:38,513 --> 00:28:41,812
It seems that no sooner
am I done watching my programs

422
00:28:41,745 --> 00:28:43,474
that a new magazine arrives.

423
00:28:43,474 --> 00:28:46,705
And suddenly, boo. It's naptime.

424
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:48,701
That's why I'm so grateful

425
00:28:48,689 --> 00:28:51,920
for new Bizzy Gal's
Diner's Ready.

426
00:28:52,946 --> 00:28:55,346
You keep Bizzy Gal
right in your cabinets.

427
00:28:55,314 --> 00:28:57,646
No more lugging open
that heavy freezer door.

428
00:28:57,618 --> 00:29:01,679
And the exhausting chore
of reheating? A thing of the past!

429
00:29:01,586 --> 00:29:04,419
Bizzy Gal meals are treated
with Nutri-Dation,

430
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:06,099
which reheats the
chemically unstable

431
00:29:06,098 --> 00:29:08,999
in a way that feels
just like heat in your mouth.

432
00:29:08,946 --> 00:29:12,404
All they'll know is
it tastes great.

433
00:29:12,338 --> 00:29:14,670
Bizzy Gal Dirnner's Ready
is sold as a novelty item

434
00:29:14,643 --> 00:29:16,577
and is not intended
for human consumption.

435
00:29:16,563 --> 00:29:18,690
Side effects of of ingestion
could include cancer,

436
00:29:18,675 --> 00:29:20,506
bleeding,
enlargment of the heart

437
00:29:20,499 --> 00:29:22,467
and second degree
burns along the rectal cavity,

438
00:29:22,451 --> 00:29:24,681
resulting in irreversible
incontinece.

439
00:29:25,267 --> 00:29:27,428
Us gals have it hard enough.

440
00:29:28,787 --> 00:29:32,086
Congratulations, Varla.

441
00:29:33,075 --> 00:29:35,908
Thanks.
Stevie got it for me.

442
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,953
So, are you and he...

443
00:29:38,451 --> 00:29:39,611
No.

444
00:29:40,244 --> 00:29:44,203
I need someone
with a... bigger heart.

445
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:46,015
I remember my first commercial.

446
00:29:46,004 --> 00:29:49,201
Do you have a tape?
I could learn so much.

447
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,404
It wasn't for TV exactly.

448
00:29:51,381 --> 00:29:53,508
I used to come out
between acts

449
00:29:53,492 --> 00:29:58,725
and sing this darling song
about Dr. Vim's Miracle Elixir.

450
00:30:01,365 --> 00:30:03,595
That's what led
to my first kinetoscope.

451
00:30:07,445 --> 00:30:10,437
If only my mother had lived
to see my very first-

452
00:30:10,389 --> 00:30:12,380
Well, that's enough
about your commercial.

453
00:30:32,022 --> 00:30:34,456
That was the worst one yet.

454
00:30:34,422 --> 00:30:36,356
According to my calculator,

455
00:30:36,342 --> 00:30:39,869
the asteroid will penetrate
the "astmosphere" in 15 minutes.

456
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:42,233
Oh, Billy...

457
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:43,959
all the children.

458
00:30:45,654 --> 00:30:48,452
You saved all you could
with the space ark.

459
00:30:48,407 --> 00:30:49,965
But what about all the people

460
00:30:49,975 --> 00:30:52,967
who could have fit
into space arks three and two?

461
00:30:56,599 --> 00:30:59,466
If ony the president
had listened to me.

462
00:30:59,415 --> 00:31:01,747
As I should have when you
were promoted over me.

463
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,154
But I was just too macho.

464
00:31:05,623 --> 00:31:09,719
Or maybe I was
so busy being an...

465
00:31:09,623 --> 00:31:12,114
astro-physi-cist...

466
00:31:12,087 --> 00:31:14,681
that I forgot how to be...

467
00:31:17,848 --> 00:31:19,475
...a woman.

468
00:31:47,577 --> 00:31:48,771
Motherfuck.

469
00:31:54,489 --> 00:31:55,979
Good night, Coco.

470
00:31:57,594 --> 00:31:58,993
Good night, hon.

471
00:32:01,049 --> 00:32:02,744
I love you.

472
00:32:03,514 --> 00:32:05,106
I love you, too.

473
00:32:07,898 --> 00:32:09,957
Pipe down in there.

474
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:14,950
School day tomorow.

475
00:32:26,203 --> 00:32:28,501
Santa Claus has entered.

476
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:32,808
Is your mommy home?

477
00:32:34,588 --> 00:32:36,249
My mother died

478
00:32:36,252 --> 00:32:40,348
in 1975.

479
00:32:41,435 --> 00:32:42,766
Sad face.

480
00:32:44,124 --> 00:32:45,716
Santa Claus has left.

481
00:33:21,949 --> 00:33:23,348
Mommy?

482
00:33:24,446 --> 00:33:26,073
I'm home.

483
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:38,041
Shut up!

484
00:33:41,022 --> 00:33:43,786
- I heard screaming.
- Jesus, what?

485
00:33:44,382 --> 00:33:45,974
I had this dream.

486
00:33:45,983 --> 00:33:48,144
Ever since the hospital.

487
00:33:49,086 --> 00:33:52,920
I think that doctor gave me
morphine and then raped me.

488
00:33:52,831 --> 00:33:54,389
Oh, my God. Coco.

489
00:33:56,479 --> 00:33:58,572
So, it's a sex dream.

490
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:02,495
Here, have some chocolate-
Have some peach sorbet.

491
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:05,266
The babies.
It doesn't make sense.

492
00:34:05,215 --> 00:34:06,842
There's no connection.

493
00:34:06,848 --> 00:34:09,976
And I cry for no reason
and blame myself.

494
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:12,854
I've been slowly
cutting off my toe with a nail file,

495
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,462
and I have no idea why!

496
00:34:17,215 --> 00:34:20,616
You know, I went in on a television
motion picture about rape,

497
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:23,877
and in the back of the script there
was a number for a support hotline.

498
00:34:23,808 --> 00:34:25,605
Jesus Christ, Varla.

499
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:30,162
Does everything around here
have to be about your fucking career?

500
00:34:30,049 --> 00:34:31,516
I was only trying to help.

501
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,114
I know what you were
only trying to do.

502
00:34:34,081 --> 00:34:36,174
I've seen your type before plenty.

503
00:34:36,161 --> 00:34:39,858
You worm your way
into the life of a huge star,

504
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:43,110
next thing I know,
you've stolen my son and my maid.

505
00:34:43,553 --> 00:34:46,317
Well, I won't let you
steal my career!

506
00:34:46,273 --> 00:34:48,207
No, that's your specialty!

507
00:34:48,705 --> 00:34:49,899
Sleepy.

508
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:54,415
Asteroid was supposed to be
my mom's big break, not yours!

509
00:34:54,305 --> 00:34:56,933
She spent two months
preparing for that role,

510
00:34:56,897 --> 00:34:59,024
working with her
being-crushed coach.

511
00:34:59,586 --> 00:35:02,350
I can still
remember her practicing.

512
00:35:02,306 --> 00:35:04,501
"It's huge!"

513
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:10,581
Little did she know
that in Hollywood,

514
00:35:10,498 --> 00:35:14,332
the real killer asteroids
don't fall from the sky!

515
00:35:17,762 --> 00:35:19,855
Still raped over here.

516
00:35:34,179 --> 00:35:37,171
- Oh, my God, I'm on fire!
- Coco! I thought you were Varla.

517
00:35:37,123 --> 00:35:39,387
Oh, my God!
Evie, Evie I'm burning!

518
00:35:39,364 --> 00:35:40,661
Burns, cold water.

519
00:35:41,188 --> 00:35:42,382
There you go.

520
00:35:42,404 --> 00:35:46,170
I'm serious.
I'll do anything they offer.

521
00:35:46,084 --> 00:35:47,210
Except porno.

522
00:35:47,236 --> 00:35:50,569
Mom, you doing porn
isn't porn anymore, it's horror.

523
00:35:50,499 --> 00:35:53,297
Everyone, this is Nipsy.

524
00:35:53,252 --> 00:35:56,483
- Nipsy, this is everyone.
- Hey, Nipsy.

525
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,251
- Boy or girl?
- From you.

526
00:35:58,244 --> 00:35:59,404
He's a boy.

527
00:35:59,428 --> 00:36:02,864
No, seriously,
supposing just for an instance

528
00:36:02,788 --> 00:36:05,018
they suddenly need
a new Bizzy Gal after tonight,

529
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,657
or tomorow morning, latest.

530
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,457
Mom, no one will hire you.

531
00:36:08,453 --> 00:36:09,613
Why not?

532
00:36:09,637 --> 00:36:12,299
I mean, I admit my looks
are starting to go...

533
00:36:12,261 --> 00:36:15,287
Starting to go?
Evie, your looks are home and in bed.

534
00:36:16,805 --> 00:36:18,466
I think you know.

535
00:36:18,469 --> 00:36:20,596
- My attitude?
- No.

536
00:36:20,581 --> 00:36:22,139
- My drinking.
- No.

537
00:36:22,149 --> 00:36:24,777
Chronic lateness?
Never learn my lines?

538
00:36:24,742 --> 00:36:27,176
The kleptomania?
I spread disease?

539
00:36:27,141 --> 00:36:28,301
Then what?

540
00:36:28,326 --> 00:36:31,693
That little thing where you ran
over a family of four while drunk off your ass?

541
00:36:31,621 --> 00:36:35,921
It was a family of six.
I only killed four.

542
00:36:35,814 --> 00:36:39,215
And what kind of people have
a picnic in their own backyard?

543
00:36:39,142 --> 00:36:41,337
- Mom.
- What?

544
00:36:47,014 --> 00:36:48,641
Nipsy.

545
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:51,729
What's wrong with him?

546
00:36:52,454 --> 00:36:53,944
Oh, Nipsy!

547
00:36:53,958 --> 00:36:56,756
That was for Varla.

548
00:36:58,439 --> 00:37:02,535
Coming up. Evie Harris vomits
her way off the Hollywood Squares

549
00:37:02,439 --> 00:37:05,636
when Has-Beens continues.

550
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:10,921
If you're like me, your days
are jam-packed with activity.

551
00:37:10,824 --> 00:37:13,918
It seems that no sooner
am I done watching my pro-

552
00:37:16,103 --> 00:37:20,472
If you're like me, your days
are jam-packed with activity.

553
00:37:21,288 --> 00:37:22,846
Us gals have it hard enough.

554
00:37:22,856 --> 00:37:24,790
Us gals have it hard-

555
00:37:24,776 --> 00:37:26,403
...have it hard... hard...

556
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,108
...hard enough.

557
00:37:39,881 --> 00:37:41,314
It's huge!

558
00:37:45,929 --> 00:37:48,727
It's huge!

559
00:37:55,049 --> 00:37:58,143
I think Bizzy Gal
is the most important thing

560
00:37:58,089 --> 00:38:00,455
to happen for women

561
00:38:00,425 --> 00:38:03,121
since they were
emancipated from slavery.

562
00:38:04,905 --> 00:38:06,873
...1975 People's Pick Awards!

563
00:38:06,858 --> 00:38:08,382
I can't finish this.

564
00:38:08,393 --> 00:38:12,796
...Leonard Nimoy. Charo.
Robert Reed...

565
00:38:12,682 --> 00:38:16,743
I heard about Asteroid.
Congratulations.

566
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:18,914
...Ted Knight.
Joey Heatherton.

567
00:38:18,891 --> 00:38:21,018
The Osmond Five.
Lee Majors.

568
00:38:21,003 --> 00:38:23,665
Allen Ludden.
William Conrad...!

569
00:39:02,476 --> 00:39:04,467
No!

570
00:39:13,068 --> 00:39:16,367
Never, dude. You're never
going to look normal again.

571
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:18,530
Dr. Benson.

572
00:39:19,085 --> 00:39:21,144
- He drug and rape you yet?
- No.

573
00:39:21,133 --> 00:39:23,727
Coco. I was going to call.

574
00:39:23,693 --> 00:39:26,184
How nice.

575
00:39:26,157 --> 00:39:30,617
A girl always likes that after
she's been drugged and raped.

576
00:39:30,509 --> 00:39:33,945
Right. About that,
I am so sorry.

577
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:35,064
Sorry?

578
00:39:35,694 --> 00:39:39,494
Then I guess that makes it okay
that you drugged and raped me.

579
00:39:39,406 --> 00:39:42,466
Jesus Christ,
I get the fucking point.

580
00:39:42,414 --> 00:39:44,882
Look, you have
every right to be ticked.

581
00:39:44,846 --> 00:39:48,543
And I know it's no excuse,
but can I try to explain?

582
00:39:48,462 --> 00:39:51,363
- Explain?
- You reminded me of someone.

583
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:53,778
Years ago, when I was
first starting out...

584
00:39:55,855 --> 00:39:58,085
...the most beautiful girl
came to see me.

585
00:39:59,087 --> 00:40:01,146
I felt our souls touch.

586
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:03,964
But I froze.

587
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:05,884
I tried to get in touch
with her later,

588
00:40:05,871 --> 00:40:08,669
but the clinic's records were anonymous
because of the letter bombs.

589
00:40:08,623 --> 00:40:10,284
Dr. Perfect?

590
00:40:12,367 --> 00:40:14,335
Patient Huge Tits?

591
00:40:15,247 --> 00:40:17,272
- It's really you!
- It's really you!

592
00:40:17,263 --> 00:40:21,063
When you came back after
I'd lost hope and married, I broke.

593
00:40:20,975 --> 00:40:23,876
I couldn't date anyone
without comparing them to you.

594
00:40:23,824 --> 00:40:27,453
Coco, God has given us
a second chance,

595
00:40:27,376 --> 00:40:30,311
and I say we take it.

596
00:40:30,256 --> 00:40:32,281
You still shouldn't
have raped me.

597
00:40:32,272 --> 00:40:34,137
Really super sorry.

598
00:41:04,433 --> 00:41:07,368
- To...
- Right. Thanks.

599
00:41:21,522 --> 00:41:24,184
Dr. Perfect.

600
00:42:10,324 --> 00:42:13,555
Nice, princess.
Real sexy.

601
00:42:25,678 --> 00:42:28,670
Chester, this will be
where you poop.

602
00:42:30,158 --> 00:42:33,787
That's a good poop, Chester.

603
00:42:34,447 --> 00:42:36,881
God, what did they
feed you at that kennel?

604
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:44,294
Oh, come on!

605
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:51,633
Guess who's going
to be in a movie.

606
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:55,558
- Me?
- Congratulations, Varla!

607
00:42:55,983 --> 00:42:57,473
What's it called?

608
00:42:57,488 --> 00:43:00,480
I think Counter Girl,
because that's the name of my role.

609
00:43:00,431 --> 00:43:02,365
Tarantulatropolis.

610
00:43:02,351 --> 00:43:05,343
So no more commercials for you.

611
00:43:05,296 --> 00:43:08,629
I told Stevie those tiny little
parts do nothing for me.

612
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:10,618
I need great big parts.

613
00:43:10,608 --> 00:43:13,736
Stevie, why didn't you
put me up for that part?

614
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,614
I could only
recommend one person moms.

615
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:18,398
That's obviously a lie
because she's practically two.

616
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:20,056
I'm sorry?

617
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:22,742
A little less binge,
a little more purge. You know what I'm saying hon?

618
00:43:22,705 --> 00:43:25,640
Damn it, Mom, shut up!

619
00:43:26,417 --> 00:43:29,318
Why should I lift a finger for you?
What have you ever done for me?

620
00:43:29,265 --> 00:43:31,563
Carried you to term,
for starters.

621
00:43:31,537 --> 00:43:34,802
Coco would have had you
sucked out for a phone number.

622
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:37,638
Evie, I can't believe
you would...

623
00:43:37,585 --> 00:43:39,576
Stop! Quiet!

624
00:43:39,577 --> 00:43:40,577
Evie.

625
00:43:45,201 --> 00:43:48,136
I'm sorry for the things
I said the other day.

626
00:43:48,081 --> 00:43:52,347
And I know my recent success
has been stressful.

627
00:43:52,242 --> 00:43:53,800
I'm sorry for that, too.

628
00:43:54,482 --> 00:43:56,143
Well, good.

629
00:43:57,522 --> 00:44:01,390
Evie, Varla said she's sorry
for what she said.

630
00:44:01,298 --> 00:44:02,663
I heard her.

631
00:44:02,675 --> 00:44:04,768
Well, you said
some mean things, too.

632
00:44:04,754 --> 00:44:06,016
Like what?

633
00:44:06,034 --> 00:44:08,901
Like she's all binge
and no purge.

634
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:11,842
- I did? That's funny.
- Mom!

635
00:44:12,371 --> 00:44:14,202
It's okay.

636
00:44:14,195 --> 00:44:16,254
I was thinking.

637
00:44:16,243 --> 00:44:20,407
I bet that the reason you're
having trouble getting parts

638
00:44:20,307 --> 00:44:24,004
is that people have forgotten
how great you are.

639
00:44:23,923 --> 00:44:25,515
So you gotta show 'em,

640
00:44:25,523 --> 00:44:28,788
just like you did in your
wonderful special, Christmas Evie.

641
00:44:30,323 --> 00:44:34,089
I remember watching it that year,
even though I was still quite small.

642
00:44:34,452 --> 00:44:36,443
I'm sure not for your age.

643
00:44:38,932 --> 00:44:41,162
And I remember
wanting to meet you.

644
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:43,233
Varla, no one's going
to give Mom a special.

645
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:45,051
I know.

646
00:44:45,044 --> 00:44:46,978
Even though they should.

647
00:44:46,964 --> 00:44:50,365
But late at night, when they
have those infomercials on

648
00:44:50,292 --> 00:44:52,954
you know, where they sell
that makeup and stuff...

649
00:44:52,916 --> 00:44:55,578
I could do one selling me.

650
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:57,508
A speci-mercial!

651
00:44:57,973 --> 00:45:00,271
Do you have any idea
how much that would cost?

652
00:45:00,245 --> 00:45:02,679
$40,000. I already checked.

653
00:45:02,645 --> 00:45:04,272
Plus production costs.

654
00:45:04,277 --> 00:45:09,874
And... I would be willing to give $10,000
of my Tarantulatropolis money.

655
00:45:09,717 --> 00:45:13,585
Varla, that is so generous.

656
00:45:13,493 --> 00:45:15,393
We'd still have to
mortgage the house mom.

657
00:45:15,382 --> 00:45:18,943
I'll make it back tenfold
when the parts start rolling in!

658
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:20,167
Thanks, Varla.

659
00:45:20,182 --> 00:45:22,707
I always liked you.

660
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:25,374
Evie, let's not quarel
anymore, all right?

661
00:45:25,974 --> 00:45:29,068
As a girl, whenever
I was cross or blue,

662
00:45:29,014 --> 00:45:33,542
my mother used to say that
feelings are like treasures,

663
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:34,954
so bury them.

664
00:45:42,263 --> 00:45:43,423
Excuse me.

665
00:45:43,447 --> 00:45:47,110
I'm a little chilly.
Be right back.

666
00:46:00,792 --> 00:46:02,851
I've really enjoyed
these past couple weeks.

667
00:46:04,215 --> 00:46:06,649
Doug, I have too.

668
00:46:06,616 --> 00:46:08,481
It's funny, isn't it?

669
00:46:08,472 --> 00:46:12,033
You fantasize about
something your entire life,

670
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:17,455
and the truth is always
so much more... muted.

671
00:46:17,304 --> 00:46:18,498
Muted?

672
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,852
In the sense of "less joyful".

673
00:46:21,656 --> 00:46:23,487
But what I've come to realize

674
00:46:23,481 --> 00:46:25,881
is that everything in life
is a disappointment.

675
00:46:25,849 --> 00:46:27,441
And in any situation,

676
00:46:27,448 --> 00:46:30,008
you have to ask yourself,

677
00:46:29,976 --> 00:46:33,707
"Can I reasonably expect better?"

678
00:46:34,521 --> 00:46:37,149
And, Coco, I don't think I can.

679
00:46:41,721 --> 00:46:43,086
Marry me.

680
00:46:43,962 --> 00:46:47,489
- Doug, that's not a very-
- You can't, either.

681
00:46:47,417 --> 00:46:50,250
You're not much to look at.

682
00:46:50,745 --> 00:46:52,576
You're no great lay.

683
00:46:53,017 --> 00:46:55,110
Quite honestly,
you're a drag to be around.

684
00:46:56,282 --> 00:46:57,681
Like I deserve better?

685
00:46:57,690 --> 00:47:00,523
I've got a bum heart.
I drink.

686
00:47:00,474 --> 00:47:02,499
I drug and rape my patients.

687
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:05,084
- You said just me.
- And I lie.

688
00:47:06,362 --> 00:47:10,196
What do you say
you and I stop chasing happy

689
00:47:10,106 --> 00:47:11,801
and settle for each other?

690
00:47:24,731 --> 00:47:27,598
- This is your college-
- It's a fucking ring.

691
00:47:27,547 --> 00:47:28,878
And...

692
00:47:31,739 --> 00:47:35,539
Michael, what are you
trying to do, play me into orbit?

693
00:47:35,451 --> 00:47:37,180
That's how it goes.

694
00:47:37,852 --> 00:47:39,479
- Bitch.
- I heard that.

695
00:47:39,484 --> 00:47:40,781
Sorry.

696
00:47:40,796 --> 00:47:41,956
Bitch.

697
00:47:46,652 --> 00:47:50,144
Singing that song
always makes me so proud.

698
00:47:50,076 --> 00:47:53,842
I am woman.
ERA now!

699
00:47:53,756 --> 00:47:56,418
- Applause, applause, applause.
- Bitch, bitch, bitch.

700
00:47:57,021 --> 00:47:58,682
Thank you!

701
00:47:59,164 --> 00:48:01,064
Thank you!

702
00:48:01,053 --> 00:48:03,487
Oh god I tell you,
I feel like I'm up here tonight

703
00:48:03,452 --> 00:48:06,012
performing in front
of all my friends.

704
00:48:06,493 --> 00:48:09,929
And you know, sometimes
all we have are friends.

705
00:48:09,853 --> 00:48:13,050
Like my friend Varla,
TV's Bizzy Gal,

706
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:15,959
who's so good in those commercials,
she actually acts thin.

707
00:48:16,541 --> 00:48:18,441
And now she has a big movie.

708
00:48:18,429 --> 00:48:20,420
But on the brink
of all that success,

709
00:48:20,414 --> 00:48:24,544
she was risking everything
by working as a prostitute.

710
00:48:24,446 --> 00:48:26,778
So I sat her down-

711
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:28,183
Evie! Oh, my God.

712
00:48:28,190 --> 00:48:31,557
Coco! What did you think?
Now, be honest.

713
00:48:31,486 --> 00:48:34,751
Varla gave you the idea
to do this show.

714
00:48:34,686 --> 00:48:36,381
She put up money for it.

715
00:48:36,383 --> 00:48:38,783
And I'm repaying the favor.

716
00:48:38,751 --> 00:48:41,311
If something like this got out
after she was famous,

717
00:48:41,279 --> 00:48:43,839
it would destroy her
like it did her mother.

718
00:48:43,807 --> 00:48:46,241
You destroyed her mother!

719
00:48:46,206 --> 00:48:48,640
For all the good it did you.

720
00:48:49,278 --> 00:48:54,306
You're just a fucking walking
ball of ambition, aren't you, Evie?

721
00:48:54,174 --> 00:48:55,869
You'd step on anybody,

722
00:48:55,871 --> 00:48:58,669
destroy anyone
if you thought it would help you.

723
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:02,171
But you know what's funny?

724
00:49:02,143 --> 00:49:06,705
People can smell it on you,
and it makes them gag.

725
00:49:08,639 --> 00:49:11,107
That's why your career
never went anywhere.

726
00:49:11,072 --> 00:49:13,370
My career was going
like gangbusters

727
00:49:13,344 --> 00:49:15,744
till that family
made me run them down!

728
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:20,572
And all you had to do
was say you're sorry.

729
00:49:21,984 --> 00:49:24,680
It's not that you didn't, Evie.

730
00:49:26,561 --> 00:49:28,586
It's that you didn't know to.

731
00:49:29,825 --> 00:49:35,024
Audiences require
at least a shred of humanity.

732
00:49:36,481 --> 00:49:40,383
Even from their
game show personalities.

733
00:49:42,913 --> 00:49:45,313
- Bitch.
- I heard that!

734
00:49:53,057 --> 00:49:54,354
Sign here.

735
00:49:56,610 --> 00:49:59,078
And here.

736
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:04,789
Initial here.

737
00:50:08,451 --> 00:50:12,444
"V.S." Such pretty initials.

738
00:50:16,706 --> 00:50:17,866
Sign here.

739
00:50:34,627 --> 00:50:37,892
It's official.
You're a movie star.

740
00:50:39,939 --> 00:50:41,531
I'll show you out.

741
00:50:55,652 --> 00:50:57,176
On second thought...

742
00:50:59,044 --> 00:51:01,740
...let's really seal the deal.

743
00:51:26,054 --> 00:51:28,181
Are you okay?
Do you want to stop?

744
00:51:28,166 --> 00:51:29,463
I'm fine.

745
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:07,611
I'm sorry.

746
00:52:09,416 --> 00:52:11,646
This has never happened before.

747
00:52:12,711 --> 00:52:15,612
- What hasn't?
- I can't...

748
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:21,340
Yeah. What's up with that?

749
00:52:25,896 --> 00:52:27,227
I've been so...

750
00:52:27,228 --> 00:52:28,228
Varla...

751
00:52:35,912 --> 00:52:39,905
I never thought,
you know, you and me...

752
00:52:39,817 --> 00:52:41,978
I couldn't stop thinking about you.

753
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:45,123
And at my practice I work
with a lot of investigators and...

754
00:52:45,124 --> 00:52:46,124
Well...

755
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:49,260
I had them get stuff on you.

756
00:52:50,409 --> 00:52:52,707
I don't think
I like the sound of that.

757
00:52:52,681 --> 00:52:53,841
Nothing creepy.

758
00:52:53,866 --> 00:52:56,630
Mostly I was just looking
for high school yearbooks,

759
00:52:56,585 --> 00:52:59,418
stories from old boyfriends to,
you know, beat off to.

760
00:52:59,370 --> 00:53:01,861
But then things
started turning up.

761
00:53:01,834 --> 00:53:03,461
Like what kind of things?

762
00:53:03,466 --> 00:53:06,867
Well, like things
in your ninth-grade diary.

763
00:53:06,794 --> 00:53:08,557
How did you get that?

764
00:53:08,554 --> 00:53:11,455
A couple goons
roughed up your aunt.

765
00:53:11,402 --> 00:53:13,893
"September 8, 1988.

766
00:53:13,866 --> 00:53:15,731
"Evie Harris killed my mom.

767
00:53:15,722 --> 00:53:18,623
I watched her Christmas special,
and I hate, hate, hate her".

768
00:53:19,435 --> 00:53:21,960
And March 15th.

769
00:53:23,723 --> 00:53:25,987
"One day
I'm going to find Evie Harris.

770
00:53:25,963 --> 00:53:27,430
"I'm going to make friends with her,

771
00:53:27,434 --> 00:53:30,164
and then I'm going to make her
pay, pay, pay, pay...".

772
00:53:30,123 --> 00:53:31,215
The rest is all "pay"!

773
00:53:31,243 --> 00:53:35,805
That was a brillion years ago,
before I discovered spiritualicity.

774
00:53:36,651 --> 00:53:40,610
Maybe, or maybe
you still want her to pay.

775
00:53:40,523 --> 00:53:42,491
Maybe just happening
to answer her ad,

776
00:53:42,476 --> 00:53:44,444
maybe driving her
into a jealous rage,

777
00:53:44,427 --> 00:53:47,658
maybe tricking her into spending
all of her money on this speci-mercial,

778
00:53:47,595 --> 00:53:50,325
maybe it's all part of some plan.

779
00:53:50,284 --> 00:53:54,482
Why should you even care?
She never loved you.

780
00:53:57,164 --> 00:53:59,291
That doesn't mean
I can't love her.

781
00:54:11,181 --> 00:54:13,274
Shred of humanity.

782
00:54:16,813 --> 00:54:17,973
Cuts.

783
00:54:19,437 --> 00:54:21,928
Career never went anywhere.

784
00:54:22,606 --> 00:54:25,234
Hello!
Battlestar fucking Galactica!

785
00:54:25,197 --> 00:54:26,459
Go to bed.

786
00:54:26,477 --> 00:54:27,967
Fuck you!

787
00:54:30,189 --> 00:54:31,656
Cut.

788
00:54:31,757 --> 00:54:33,588
Cut.

789
00:54:33,581 --> 00:54:35,412
Uncut.

790
00:54:35,406 --> 00:54:36,771
Jesus!

791
00:54:36,782 --> 00:54:39,046
I guess you can't
fuck your way to the top,

792
00:54:39,022 --> 00:54:42,651
or I'd be queen
of the goddamn universe!

793
00:54:42,990 --> 00:54:44,150
Cuts.

794
00:54:44,814 --> 00:54:47,180
- Hello.
- Coco awake?

795
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:50,085
Thought I'd twist her arm
for a lie-there.

796
00:54:50,031 --> 00:54:52,022
Well, you could do that.

797
00:54:52,015 --> 00:54:56,281
And then again,
I'm already on my back and tanked.

798
00:55:11,695 --> 00:55:14,926
Harder. Harder!

799
00:55:14,927 --> 00:55:15,927
Coco!

800
00:55:14,927 --> 00:55:15,927
Doug?

801
00:55:24,784 --> 00:55:28,049
You have to admit, this is
kind of its own punishment.

802
00:55:27,984 --> 00:55:29,645
Harder!

803
00:55:37,777 --> 00:55:40,245
So, this is the stage.

804
00:55:40,209 --> 00:55:41,369
What?

805
00:55:41,392 --> 00:55:45,852
Where's the big block letters
that say "Evie" like I paid for?

806
00:55:45,745 --> 00:55:47,736
We add that in
with the computer later.

807
00:55:47,729 --> 00:55:52,928
Really? Gosh, so much has changed
since I was slightly younger.

808
00:55:53,905 --> 00:55:56,066
But you always want
to fuck the grips.

809
00:55:56,049 --> 00:55:59,917
So listen the only trick with this set
is you can't wear any blue

810
00:55:59,826 --> 00:56:04,354
or any color that has blue in it-
no turquoise, no purple.

811
00:56:04,242 --> 00:56:05,504
This is important Miss Harris.

812
00:56:05,522 --> 00:56:08,389
Because the computer replaces
all blue with the fake set.

813
00:56:08,818 --> 00:56:11,719
Speaking of fake sets,
how do you like my boobs?

814
00:56:11,666 --> 00:56:14,396
Feel. It's gross, huh?

815
00:56:14,397 --> 00:56:15,397
Varla?

816
00:57:15,093 --> 00:57:16,993
What's wrong?

817
00:57:16,981 --> 00:57:19,211
Let's save the kisses
till I'm sure you mean them.

818
00:57:25,014 --> 00:57:28,506
Oh! Of all the nights
for the Botox to wear off.

819
00:57:31,670 --> 00:57:33,228
Hello, Evie.

820
00:57:33,229 --> 00:57:34,229
Coco!

821
00:57:34,517 --> 00:57:35,779
Friends?

822
00:57:35,797 --> 00:57:38,823
- Are you high?
- A little bit.

823
00:57:39,350 --> 00:57:42,342
I just came by
to ask you one last time

824
00:57:42,294 --> 00:57:44,592
to drop that part about Varla.

825
00:57:44,566 --> 00:57:46,830
Oh, you're just mad
'cause I killed your marriage.

826
00:57:46,806 --> 00:57:50,367
Not this time.
We're going through with it.

827
00:57:51,478 --> 00:57:53,571
Of course, it won't
be charmed like I'd hoped,

828
00:57:53,559 --> 00:57:55,493
and I'll always be
a little mistrustful.

829
00:57:55,479 --> 00:57:56,946
You made sure of that.

830
00:57:56,951 --> 00:57:59,852
- Plus, he did rape you.
- Fair point.

831
00:58:02,006 --> 00:58:04,133
That's just it, Evie.

832
00:58:04,119 --> 00:58:08,283
You and me,
we're damaged goods.

833
00:58:08,183 --> 00:58:12,381
But Varla, at least
with her there's hope.

834
00:58:13,431 --> 00:58:15,558
And hope dies
quickly enough on its own.

835
00:58:17,975 --> 00:58:21,934
Ninety seconds, people.
Who has eyes on Gross Boobs?

836
00:58:24,439 --> 00:58:26,600
Miss Harris,
we need you on the set.

837
00:58:29,656 --> 00:58:31,385
Well, I'm on.

838
00:58:31,384 --> 00:58:33,113
This is gonna be
like The Mike Douglas Show

839
00:58:33,112 --> 00:58:36,513
and the Democratic Party Telethon
all rolled into one.

840
00:58:42,296 --> 00:58:43,456
Good luck, Ma.

841
00:58:44,281 --> 00:58:45,578
Thanks, Stevie.

842
00:58:45,593 --> 00:58:47,390
Good luck, Evie.

843
00:58:48,185 --> 00:58:49,550
Thank you, Coco.

844
00:58:49,561 --> 00:58:51,893
Yes. Good luck.

845
00:58:56,601 --> 00:58:58,193
Miss Harris?

846
00:59:12,410 --> 00:59:15,072
Live from Glendale City College.

847
00:59:15,034 --> 00:59:17,696
It's All About Evie!

848
00:59:17,658 --> 00:59:20,923
Five... four... three...

849
00:59:23,674 --> 00:59:26,404
Look at me,
then you'll see

850
00:59:26,362 --> 00:59:27,795
All around you

851
00:59:27,802 --> 00:59:30,396
It's glittery
and flashy tonight

852
00:59:30,363 --> 00:59:33,264
It's all about Evie tonight

853
00:59:33,210 --> 00:59:35,701
It's special and dreamy,
it's all about Evie!

854
00:59:35,675 --> 00:59:37,836
So come and look at me tonight

855
00:59:37,819 --> 00:59:39,810
House with a pool.
House with a pool.

856
00:59:39,803 --> 00:59:41,498
Look at me!

857
00:59:46,363 --> 00:59:48,558
I've been with you so long

858
00:59:48,539 --> 00:59:51,804
I find I'm singing this song

859
00:59:54,331 --> 00:59:58,165
I've had time
to think of a way

860
00:59:58,075 --> 01:00:01,135
for my heart to say

861
01:00:03,516 --> 01:00:08,783
I need you
every moment of every day

862
01:00:08,636 --> 01:00:12,834
I love you
more and more than I'll ever say

863
01:00:12,732 --> 01:00:17,601
What will I do
if you decide to go away?

864
01:00:17,469 --> 01:00:20,836
Stay with me forever

865
01:00:20,764 --> 01:00:23,096
and ever

866
01:00:23,069 --> 01:00:26,903
Stay with me

867
01:00:29,437 --> 01:00:31,803
Oh thank you!

868
01:00:33,949 --> 01:00:36,247
I love you too.

869
01:00:36,221 --> 01:00:39,247
Oh god I tell you, I just, I feel like
I'm up here tonight performing

870
01:00:39,198 --> 01:00:41,325
in front of all my friends.

871
01:00:42,685 --> 01:00:45,449
And you know, sometimes
all we have are friends.

872
01:00:45,406 --> 01:00:46,464
What?

873
01:00:46,494 --> 01:00:47,927
Nothing.

874
01:00:47,934 --> 01:00:51,165
Like my friend Varla,
TV's Bizzy Gal.

875
01:00:52,094 --> 01:00:55,427
Who's so good in those spots,
she actually acts thin.

876
01:00:56,831 --> 01:00:59,527
And now she has a movie!

877
01:00:59,486 --> 01:01:03,115
But on the brink of all
that success, she was willing to-

878
01:01:09,055 --> 01:01:13,116
Cat got my tongue.
Let me just drown him real quick.

879
01:01:19,872 --> 01:01:21,169
That's better.

880
01:01:21,184 --> 01:01:22,776
Oh boy!

881
01:01:28,096 --> 01:01:29,495
That was peculiar.

882
01:01:29,504 --> 01:01:32,996
- What's going on?
- Don't insult my intelligentness.

883
01:01:32,928 --> 01:01:35,362
I just felt a rush
of disorientation

884
01:01:35,328 --> 01:01:37,228
and a flash of colored lights.

885
01:01:37,216 --> 01:01:40,117
Very much like when you chop
a Vicodin up in your hash

886
01:01:40,064 --> 01:01:42,225
while you're still flying
from last night's Quaalude.

887
01:01:42,208 --> 01:01:44,870
I'll say one thing for you,
you're poetic.

888
01:01:44,833 --> 01:01:47,597
I'd even swear there was a milligram
or two of psilocybin in there.

889
01:01:47,553 --> 01:01:49,077
No, one.

890
01:01:49,088 --> 01:01:50,646
What's that supposed to mean?

891
01:01:50,656 --> 01:01:53,716
But I didn't take
anything special tonight-Oh party!

892
01:01:53,665 --> 01:01:55,633
- I would never.
- Then who would?

893
01:01:55,634 --> 01:01:56,634
Waiter more cock!

894
01:01:58,177 --> 01:02:00,839
No, no, the one with sprinkles.

895
01:02:05,985 --> 01:02:09,045
Never mess
with the doctor's wife.

896
01:02:10,657 --> 01:02:13,592
Sit down, kids.
You'll miss the show.

897
01:02:14,753 --> 01:02:17,187
I can date-rape myself.

898
01:02:17,154 --> 01:02:19,019
Five, six, seven, eight!

899
01:02:20,802 --> 01:02:22,064
Howie, Fred!

900
01:02:22,082 --> 01:02:26,485
Varla, TV's Bizzy Gal-
busy missy sissy.

901
01:02:26,370 --> 01:02:28,429
And her mom...

902
01:02:29,218 --> 01:02:30,776
I can't finish this.

903
01:02:30,786 --> 01:02:33,152
- You don't have an agent.
- Sleigh gay...

904
01:02:33,827 --> 01:02:34,953
It's huge.

905
01:02:34,978 --> 01:02:37,242
Mad about...
Talk... Tom...

906
01:02:37,219 --> 01:02:40,017
Can't be...
Goddamn it.

907
01:02:39,971 --> 01:02:43,134
They knew Oxloud
was hee naws.

908
01:02:44,643 --> 01:02:47,441
George Peppard, great lay.

909
01:02:47,395 --> 01:02:49,454
But talk about loud!

910
01:02:49,443 --> 01:02:52,276
They knew he was
coming in Oxnard.

911
01:02:56,451 --> 01:02:58,214
Wonderful!

912
01:02:59,075 --> 01:03:00,099
Thanks, Jeff.

913
01:03:00,131 --> 01:03:01,826
- It's Nate.
- Whatever.

914
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:10,269
Lorne Greene!
"Swell party, Evie".

915
01:03:10,212 --> 01:03:13,511
Say, did you ever
shit out that earring?

916
01:03:13,444 --> 01:03:15,378
Trail mix?

917
01:03:18,917 --> 01:03:20,908
Coco! - Trish!
- Keep away from Bob!

918
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:22,060
Hi, Evie.

919
01:03:23,557 --> 01:03:24,751
So...

920
01:03:24,773 --> 01:03:26,331
where's...

921
01:03:27,108 --> 01:03:30,100
Brad? He's packing.

922
01:03:30,885 --> 01:03:33,080
The firm
transfered him to Michigan.

923
01:03:33,061 --> 01:03:34,926
Evie, he proposed!

924
01:03:36,933 --> 01:03:39,800
Coco, you can't move to Michigan.

925
01:03:39,749 --> 01:03:41,842
What about your acting career?

926
01:03:41,829 --> 01:03:45,629
Let's face it, I'm not
pretty enough to be an actress.

927
01:03:47,269 --> 01:03:50,136
Lots of actresses aren't pretty.

928
01:03:50,086 --> 01:03:52,646
Plus, who's gonna
keep my schedule?

929
01:03:52,614 --> 01:03:54,673
You could give
doing for yourself a try.

930
01:03:55,622 --> 01:03:58,955
Anyway, you said
you don't love Brad.

931
01:03:58,887 --> 01:04:01,014
I could learn.

932
01:04:00,999 --> 01:04:02,557
Don't bother.

933
01:04:04,583 --> 01:04:08,019
And this was my grandmother's!
Gimme it! Gimme it!

934
01:04:12,551 --> 01:04:13,916
Pull, you pussy.

935
01:04:15,303 --> 01:04:19,763
So, what do I have
on tap for tomorrow?

936
01:04:23,336 --> 01:04:25,133
Mom?

937
01:04:27,847 --> 01:04:30,247
Can I come and play
at the party with you?

938
01:04:30,215 --> 01:04:32,513
You'd just be bored.

939
01:04:34,536 --> 01:04:37,596
It's more fun in there.
Mommy, can I live...

940
01:04:37,543 --> 01:04:39,943
...here instead of
at boarding school this summer?

941
01:04:39,912 --> 01:04:42,813
We'll talk about it
on the way to the airport.

942
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:47,094
But, Mommy,
I want to stay here with you.

943
01:04:46,985 --> 01:04:48,316
I love you.

944
01:04:48,745 --> 01:04:50,940
Of course you do.

945
01:04:51,369 --> 01:04:56,363
But mommy can't let people know
she's old enough to have such a big boy.

946
01:04:56,233 --> 01:04:57,723
You'd ruin everything.

947
01:04:57,737 --> 01:05:00,001
I'll send you lots of money, though.

948
01:05:01,993 --> 01:05:03,153
Coming!

949
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:11,396
Where is she?

950
01:05:14,985 --> 01:05:19,786
Where is the woman
who stole my life?

951
01:05:19,658 --> 01:05:21,125
Marla!

952
01:05:21,930 --> 01:05:24,364
There she is. There...

953
01:05:24,330 --> 01:05:27,629
- ... it is!
- Let me get you a drink.

954
01:05:30,314 --> 01:05:32,612
Stevie, come shield Mommy.

955
01:05:35,210 --> 01:05:36,541
No, no, no.

956
01:05:37,771 --> 01:05:40,501
I want you all here for this.

957
01:05:40,458 --> 01:05:42,688
I want you to hear for this.
Just hear this.

958
01:05:42,667 --> 01:05:45,397
That is not her color.

959
01:05:45,771 --> 01:05:47,898
Why I'm not in Asteroid.

960
01:05:49,259 --> 01:05:51,921
And why my daughter Varla

961
01:05:51,883 --> 01:05:55,546
will never see me
in Asteroid...

962
01:05:55,467 --> 01:05:58,334
...and Asteroid 3...

963
01:05:59,019 --> 01:06:00,179
'Cause of her!

964
01:06:02,924 --> 01:06:04,084
Me?

965
01:06:05,484 --> 01:06:09,011
You all just think
I'm that crazy girl

966
01:06:08,940 --> 01:06:11,238
from the People's Pick Awards.

967
01:06:12,396 --> 01:06:14,023
But she drugged me!

968
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:16,579
Mommy's on TV!

969
01:06:16,588 --> 01:06:20,684
And that whole week.
There was so much fucking.

970
01:06:22,637 --> 01:06:26,596
I know just where
I'm putting this.

971
01:06:30,093 --> 01:06:31,822
I forgot to thank my agent.

972
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:33,083
Mommy!

973
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:34,567
She's lying!

974
01:06:42,477 --> 01:06:44,069
You don't have to.

975
01:06:46,157 --> 01:06:47,647
None of you.

976
01:06:51,534 --> 01:06:53,126
I don't care anymore.

977
01:06:54,702 --> 01:07:00,038
But I did want you all
to see one thing.

978
01:07:01,422 --> 01:07:06,689
Because I practiced
so, so much.

979
01:07:25,103 --> 01:07:27,333
It's huge!

980
01:07:41,232 --> 01:07:42,597
Looney Tunes.

981
01:07:43,216 --> 01:07:45,684
Listen, how about let's us
move the party inside?

982
01:07:48,081 --> 01:07:49,070
Wait.

983
01:07:49,104 --> 01:07:50,969
Everyone...

984
01:07:50,961 --> 01:07:52,622
...don't leave.

985
01:07:52,625 --> 01:07:54,718
Farah. Lee.

986
01:07:54,704 --> 01:07:55,966
Sheila.

987
01:07:55,984 --> 01:08:00,216
Mort, don't you go.
I'll switch agents.

988
01:08:00,112 --> 01:08:02,046
- You...
- ... don't have an agent.

989
01:08:02,032 --> 01:08:04,592
No! Dan, you can't.

990
01:08:04,561 --> 01:08:08,053
Everybody, it's early!
I'll break out the orgy coke.

991
01:08:07,985 --> 01:08:11,079
Heads-up
there's another party at Charo's.

992
01:08:26,770 --> 01:08:27,998
Damn it!

993
01:08:28,722 --> 01:08:30,383
Damn it! Damn it!

994
01:08:30,383 --> 01:08:31,000
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

995
01:08:31,685 --> 01:08:36,485
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

996
01:08:36,386 --> 01:08:37,386
Damn it!

997
01:08:47,923 --> 01:08:49,481
Everyone?

998
01:08:54,035 --> 01:08:55,468
Anyone?

999
01:08:59,539 --> 01:09:00,870
Hello?

1000
01:09:07,379 --> 01:09:09,040
I can't be alone.

1001
01:09:10,547 --> 01:09:11,741
Please.

1002
01:09:17,492 --> 01:09:19,084
I'm scared.

1003
01:09:45,781 --> 01:09:48,682
I didn't mean to!

1004
01:09:54,357 --> 01:09:57,053
You want something,
you take it!

1005
01:10:00,534 --> 01:10:02,126
If I were a man...

1006
01:10:26,871 --> 01:10:28,532
I'm sorry.

1007
01:10:35,813 --> 01:10:36,533
Coco

1008
01:10:41,176 --> 01:10:43,337
I'm sorry.

1009
01:10:45,591 --> 01:10:47,422
Thank you.

1010
01:10:47,423 --> 01:10:48,423
Varla

1011
01:10:51,544 --> 01:10:53,637
I'm sorry.

1012
01:10:55,289 --> 01:10:56,779
I know.

1013
01:10:59,780 --> 01:11:00,780
And Stevie,

1014
01:11:01,689 --> 01:11:03,247
you most of all.

1015
01:11:06,169 --> 01:11:08,364
Everyone!

1016
01:11:08,345 --> 01:11:12,111
For all of it, I'm sorry!

1017
01:11:13,049 --> 01:11:14,073
It's huge!

1018
01:11:23,961 --> 01:11:25,792
Good night, everyone!

1019
01:11:28,570 --> 01:11:30,367
Good night, you.

1020
01:11:41,082 --> 01:11:43,073
- Mom!
- Over here.

1021
01:11:44,283 --> 01:11:47,980
Well, we're off to Wyoming
for this one's big-screen debut.

1022
01:11:48,443 --> 01:11:49,967
Tarantulas!

1023
01:11:51,067 --> 01:11:52,591
She's already in character.

1024
01:11:52,603 --> 01:11:55,663
- Hey, bud, a little help.
- Oh, yeah, I gotcha.

1025
01:11:56,123 --> 01:11:58,455
That was very good.

1026
01:11:59,451 --> 01:12:00,941
It was?

1027
01:12:00,955 --> 01:12:03,480
I really thought
I had tarantulas.

1028
01:12:03,452 --> 01:12:05,477
You're gonna be amazing.

1029
01:12:08,284 --> 01:12:10,445
I was worried
you might be upset.

1030
01:12:11,195 --> 01:12:14,460
I want you to have
a big career, Varla.

1031
01:12:14,396 --> 01:12:16,830
Big enough for all of us.

1032
01:12:17,468 --> 01:12:19,936
That means so much...

1033
01:12:21,820 --> 01:12:23,378
Mom.

1034
01:12:25,436 --> 01:12:27,336
Congratulations!

1035
01:12:27,324 --> 01:12:29,053
Thanks.

1036
01:12:29,052 --> 01:12:31,577
And you don't mind
about his little...

1037
01:12:33,116 --> 01:12:37,052
Once I realized
how much I love Stevie,

1038
01:12:36,956 --> 01:12:38,685
nothing else mattered.

1039
01:12:40,444 --> 01:12:42,071
It's a little small.

1040
01:12:44,221 --> 01:12:46,917
Well, we better get going
to the airport.

1041
01:12:46,877 --> 01:12:49,505
Stevie, I just heard.
Come here.

1042
01:12:52,637 --> 01:12:55,800
I am so happy for you.

1043
01:12:59,678 --> 01:13:01,270
I love you mom.

1044
01:13:01,917 --> 01:13:03,851
Of course you do.

1045
01:13:05,150 --> 01:13:07,345
Well, I'm all packed.

1046
01:13:08,222 --> 01:13:09,849
That must be Doug.

1047
01:13:10,878 --> 01:13:14,041
Coco, you can do a lot better.

1048
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:15,507
It was never about him.

1049
01:13:15,508 --> 01:13:16,508
Evie...

1050
01:13:18,750 --> 01:13:20,217
I'm pregnant.

1051
01:13:21,055 --> 01:13:22,613
Really?

1052
01:13:22,614 --> 01:13:23,614
Oh Coco!

1053
01:13:24,671 --> 01:13:26,161
Thank you.

1054
01:13:27,071 --> 01:13:30,063
And... I'm sorry about the house.

1055
01:13:30,015 --> 01:13:34,111
Oh this old claptrap?
I'm glad to be rid of it.

1056
01:13:34,015 --> 01:13:35,573
Fresh start.

1057
01:13:35,574 --> 01:13:36,574
Coco!

1058
01:13:39,296 --> 01:13:40,820
You gave me herpes.

1059
01:13:41,279 --> 01:13:44,043
Need to work
on your delivery, hon.

1060
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:48,494
I've heard that line read
by the biggest stars in Hollywood.
