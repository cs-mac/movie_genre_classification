1
00:00:07,958 --> 00:00:09,259
(Final Episode)

2
00:00:09,726 --> 00:00:11,694
I'll make sure to watch him get caught.

3
00:00:11,695 --> 00:00:14,464
We have to go and see
Chairman Park get arrested.

4
00:00:14,664 --> 00:00:16,365
Stop talking and step on it!

5
00:00:16,366 --> 00:00:19,169
I'll step on it while I'm talking.

6
00:00:20,504 --> 00:00:21,571
Step on it!

7
00:00:50,267 --> 00:00:51,802
I believe he ran away.

8
00:00:57,674 --> 00:00:59,009
When did he leave work?

9
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:00,644
An hour ago?

10
00:01:01,578 --> 00:01:02,579
What about his house?

11
00:01:03,246 --> 00:01:05,916
Where the heck did he go? All right.

12
00:01:07,117 --> 00:01:08,717
He's so quick.

13
00:01:08,718 --> 00:01:11,787
He isn't home or at work.
Where's he hiding?

14
00:01:11,788 --> 00:01:13,623
He isn't trying to hide.

15
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:16,093
He's trying to run away.

16
00:01:33,043 --> 00:01:34,678
I'm fine. I'm leaving alone.

17
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:37,480
There's no use in issuing
him a travel ban now.

18
00:01:37,481 --> 00:01:39,521
You can't get him if he
leaves in 20 to 30 minutes.

19
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:40,951
Okay, come quickly.

20
00:01:41,318 --> 00:01:42,919
I hope he didn't take off.

21
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,422
We're almost there.

22
00:02:08,078 --> 00:02:09,212
Go that way.

23
00:02:24,494 --> 00:02:26,263
Park Hyun Do, where are you?

24
00:02:26,663 --> 00:02:29,966
How dare you run away after
using me as a cover?

25
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:32,234
I will rip out his face.

26
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:35,271
Testing, testing. I am looking for a man.

27
00:02:35,272 --> 00:02:36,940
This is an emergency announcement.

28
00:02:37,474 --> 00:02:41,378
There is a certain criminal
trying to run overseas.

29
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:45,348
He instigated murder and embezzled money.

30
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,852
Do you know who he is? He is...

31
00:02:49,853 --> 00:02:52,122
Chairman Park Hyun Do
of TQ Group, everyone.

32
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,457
Chairman Park is a man in his 50s...

33
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:57,893
with a very courteous face.

34
00:02:57,894 --> 00:03:01,298
He also has a very deep voice.

35
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,199
- He's so weird.
- Where do you think...

36
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,366
he will run off to?

37
00:03:04,367 --> 00:03:06,869
To the US? To Germany? To Tanzania?

38
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,972
Or could he be going to Denmark?

39
00:03:09,573 --> 00:03:12,041
Right, he must be going to Denmark.

40
00:03:12,042 --> 00:03:15,445
Anyway, he's determined to run and hide.

41
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:19,181
So if anyone sees him, make a report...

42
00:03:19,182 --> 00:03:22,953
to a nearest army base or a police station.

43
00:03:26,556 --> 00:03:29,192
Hey, stop fooling around
and come to gate eight.

44
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,673
Darn it, where is he?

45
00:04:00,457 --> 00:04:01,857
Where are you going, Chairman Park?

46
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:04,094
- Let go of me.
- Come with me.

47
00:04:04,194 --> 00:04:06,295
Let go. Call the security.

48
00:04:06,296 --> 00:04:07,796
He is trying to attack me.

49
00:04:07,797 --> 00:04:09,865
- Excuse me, here.
- Don't get me.

50
00:04:09,866 --> 00:04:11,100
- You have to take him.
- Move away.

51
00:04:11,101 --> 00:04:13,235
He is a convicted criminal
who wants to run away.

52
00:04:13,236 --> 00:04:14,903
- How dare you accuse me?
- Come here.

53
00:04:14,904 --> 00:04:16,905
Come here. No, don't do that.

54
00:04:16,906 --> 00:04:18,040
Let go of me.

55
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:20,110
Do you know what he has done?

56
00:04:20,543 --> 00:04:22,878
- You have to get him.
- Calm down.

57
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:24,648
Stop them.

58
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:28,285
You'll make me sad if you leave like this.

59
00:04:34,324 --> 00:04:35,558
(Arrest Warrant)

60
00:04:41,097 --> 00:04:42,465
Why didn't you come any sooner?

61
00:04:48,305 --> 00:04:49,606
Yes, okay.

62
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:51,675
Great job.

63
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:55,278
Did he get caught?

64
00:05:05,188 --> 00:05:06,322
Hey, Ga Eun.

65
00:05:06,323 --> 00:05:07,357
Hello.

66
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,995
You must all be tired.

67
00:05:12,295 --> 00:05:15,365
Take one each before you begin. You too.

68
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:17,901
Recharge your energy!

69
00:05:18,101 --> 00:05:19,102
Recharged.

70
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:21,237
When will his lawyers get here?

71
00:05:21,371 --> 00:05:24,374
They'll be here in 10 minutes.

72
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,977
I think things are finally
coming to an end.

73
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,513
We got them at the hospital yesterday...

74
00:05:31,848 --> 00:05:33,088
and we got Chairman Park today.

75
00:05:33,383 --> 00:05:36,952
Chief Kim, how did you come
up with the plan to...

76
00:05:36,953 --> 00:05:38,888
catch those who tried to kill Mr. Lee?

77
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:41,624
Oh, that?

78
00:05:43,993 --> 00:05:47,563
Mr. Choo, I'll go visit Mr. Lee.

79
00:05:47,564 --> 00:05:49,265
Sure. Go ahead.

80
00:05:49,466 --> 00:05:50,467
Yes.

81
00:05:56,206 --> 00:05:57,273
Ha Gyeong.

82
00:05:57,907 --> 00:05:58,942
Yes?

83
00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:04,346
Do you really think so?

84
00:06:04,347 --> 00:06:05,948
I'm sure they planted people there.

85
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:09,686
They're probably being
cautious after the accusation.

86
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,954
Will they put Soo Jin in danger?

87
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:14,456
We have to do something
before anything happens.

88
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,925
First, check and see if anyone is around.

89
00:06:16,926 --> 00:06:19,796
If you do see someone, do as I say.

90
00:06:23,566 --> 00:06:24,601
Ha Gyeong.

91
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:27,470
What's going on? Are his pupils reacting?

92
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:30,205
Yes. I could feel a bit of communication.

93
00:06:30,206 --> 00:06:31,507
What did the doctor say?

94
00:06:31,508 --> 00:06:34,611
He said he's as good as awake.

95
00:06:37,247 --> 00:06:38,648
This is so great.

96
00:06:39,282 --> 00:06:40,350
Come and see.

97
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,462
Since when was he around?

98
00:06:52,862 --> 00:06:54,197
It's been a few days.

99
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:58,101
Don't worry, Soo Jin.

100
00:07:00,103 --> 00:07:03,005
Make sure you keep your eyes on them.

101
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:05,074
Yes, I will.

102
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,474
Oh, really? Give me a second.

103
00:07:49,285 --> 00:07:51,821
They were completely trapped, then.

104
00:07:52,121 --> 00:07:55,057
What was in Mr. Lee's...

105
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:56,926
dash cam?

106
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,495
Why are you curious? You already know.

107
00:07:59,496 --> 00:08:02,365
But still. Ga Eun, tell me.

108
00:08:03,766 --> 00:08:04,901
Well...

109
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:12,208
Don't you dare say anything
to the prosecutor.

110
00:08:12,342 --> 00:08:14,477
We cannot guarantee your safety.

111
00:08:15,044 --> 00:08:17,046
So turn yourself in right now saying...

112
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:19,481
you're there for embezzlement and gambling.

113
00:08:19,482 --> 00:08:23,119
And tell us where the materials are...

114
00:08:23,786 --> 00:08:25,922
and erase all of the texts
and call history from us.

115
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:32,595
No.

116
00:08:34,531 --> 00:08:36,032
I can't do that.

117
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,482
Who... Who are you?

118
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:56,853
Why are you doing this to me?

119
00:09:08,031 --> 00:09:10,667
Wait, these are...

120
00:09:24,347 --> 00:09:27,984
Write, "Please cremate me right away."

121
00:09:37,026 --> 00:09:39,186
(I'm sorry. I can't turn back.
I have to protect you.)

122
00:09:42,231 --> 00:09:43,566
(Please cremate me right away.)

123
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,595
Those jerks.

124
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:16,598
You have to take all of
them in while we are at it.

125
00:10:16,599 --> 00:10:19,769
Yes. We'll interrogate them
and get their confession.

126
00:10:20,169 --> 00:10:21,604
The lawyers are here.

127
00:10:29,612 --> 00:10:31,414
(Bill of Indictment)

128
00:10:32,081 --> 00:10:33,549
The murder and kidnapping were...

129
00:10:34,283 --> 00:10:35,785
all your orders, right?

130
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:39,355
I don't know anything about this.

131
00:10:41,124 --> 00:10:43,191
There's evidence to prove
your murder instigation.

132
00:10:43,192 --> 00:10:46,896
Is there an evidence that it was my order?

133
00:10:48,798 --> 00:10:50,867
Okay. Ms. Cho.

134
00:10:51,934 --> 00:10:54,470
Those were ordered by
Chairman Park, correct?

135
00:10:58,408 --> 00:10:59,575
Ms. Cho!

136
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,781
Everything is...

137
00:11:05,782 --> 00:11:07,050
Ms. Cho...

138
00:11:08,117 --> 00:11:11,187
did this on her own.

139
00:11:13,856 --> 00:11:16,626
She stepped over the line...

140
00:11:16,826 --> 00:11:18,394
to show her loyalty to me.

141
00:11:19,195 --> 00:11:22,098
Ms. Cho, I always told you...

142
00:11:22,665 --> 00:11:24,333
to stay within the bounds...

143
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,502
and to never cross the line.

144
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,209
He's so shameless.

145
00:11:33,543 --> 00:11:35,545
He's no human being.

146
00:11:36,179 --> 00:11:39,348
Don't you think he's putting
it all on Director Cho?

147
00:11:40,316 --> 00:11:42,818
Embezzlement, tax evasion,

148
00:11:42,819 --> 00:11:46,222
fraudulent tax reports and the slush fund.

149
00:11:46,522 --> 00:11:49,325
Do you think that makes sense?

150
00:11:49,892 --> 00:11:51,894
The money you say I embezzled.

151
00:11:52,495 --> 00:11:54,197
Where is it now?

152
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,598
You haven't found it.

153
00:11:56,599 --> 00:11:59,801
We have account details from
Taiwan and Switzerland.

154
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:02,105
Letters and numbers?

155
00:12:02,739 --> 00:12:05,775
Anyone can fake them.

156
00:12:06,275 --> 00:12:10,113
Name exactly where the money is, okay?

157
00:12:15,785 --> 00:12:20,089
How dare he. I want to
burst through the window.

158
00:12:21,891 --> 00:12:25,495
Can't you use a lie detector or something?

159
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,296
That's of no use.

160
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:31,334
This game will only end
when we find the money.

161
00:12:32,301 --> 00:12:33,369
No.

162
00:12:34,403 --> 00:12:36,339
That's not the end.

163
00:12:38,474 --> 00:12:40,176
Sending him to prison.

164
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:43,346
That's the real ending.

165
00:12:44,814 --> 00:12:47,082
However hard I think,

166
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:50,219
there's just no way to locate
the chairman's account.

167
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:54,890
Can't we get the information
from the Swiss bank?

168
00:12:54,891 --> 00:12:57,926
Their clients' information is confidential.

169
00:12:57,927 --> 00:13:01,062
They use account numbers, not names.

170
00:13:01,063 --> 00:13:02,531
They're untraceable.

171
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:05,668
It's the perfect tax haven.

172
00:13:06,502 --> 00:13:09,771
Didn't Switzerland agree
to share information...

173
00:13:09,772 --> 00:13:11,974
to help eradicate corruption?

174
00:13:12,008 --> 00:13:15,243
This bank didn't. That's
why the chairman chose it.

175
00:13:15,244 --> 00:13:18,614
Do you mean only he can withdraw the money?

176
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:21,249
We need him to access the account...

177
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,418
so we can catch him in the act.

178
00:13:23,419 --> 00:13:26,489
He'd never do that in this situation.

179
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:29,325
Wasn't Gang Sik in charge?

180
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:32,428
Though, he put someone else in charge now.

181
00:13:33,496 --> 00:13:38,367
Do you think Director Go
and Manager Lee are okay?

182
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,741
Are you done yet?

183
00:13:47,476 --> 00:13:50,212
I got two-thirds of the way through.

184
00:13:50,213 --> 00:13:52,480
I think we'll be free in two more hours.

185
00:13:52,481 --> 00:13:56,619
Okay. I can't believe they
starved us for two days.

186
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,055
Are they trying to kill us?

187
00:13:59,856 --> 00:14:00,957
I'm starving.

188
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:15,204
- Hey.
- Stop calling me, I'm busy.

189
00:14:16,873 --> 00:14:19,007
- I'm free.
- You can't be.

190
00:14:19,008 --> 00:14:20,809
I need two more hours.

191
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:23,613
- Look.
- Stop asking me to look at...

192
00:14:25,147 --> 00:14:26,482
My hands are free.

193
00:14:27,884 --> 00:14:29,051
How'd you do that?

194
00:14:29,819 --> 00:14:30,820
I don't know.

195
00:14:31,187 --> 00:14:33,788
Shoot. Why didn't you tell me sooner?

196
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:36,925
I've been chewing a rope for
hours with bloody lips...

197
00:14:36,926 --> 00:14:38,693
and my legs are cramped.

198
00:14:38,694 --> 00:14:40,595
Why didn't you use that skill sooner?

199
00:14:40,596 --> 00:14:43,965
I don't believe this. This is unbelievable.

200
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:46,968
- I'm sorry.
- This is so unfair.

201
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:49,938
- You did well.
- Untie me right now.

202
00:14:49,939 --> 00:14:52,241
- I will.
- Hurry up, then.

203
00:14:52,341 --> 00:14:53,676
I'm so tired.

204
00:14:53,776 --> 00:14:55,210
- Hang in there.
- Hurry up.

205
00:14:55,211 --> 00:14:57,579
- Okay.
- You're slow at untying me.

206
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,614
Work faster.

207
00:15:05,454 --> 00:15:09,025
It came loose on its own. I
didn't do it on purpose.

208
00:15:09,792 --> 00:15:10,826
We're detectives.

209
00:15:11,027 --> 00:15:13,395
You're here to save us. Thank you.

210
00:15:13,396 --> 00:15:15,597
- We're safe now.
- We're safe.

211
00:15:15,598 --> 00:15:17,733
- Can you untie me?
- Go Man Geun.

212
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,435
Lee Gang Sik, you're under arrest...

213
00:15:20,436 --> 00:15:22,538
for breach of duty and document forgery.

214
00:15:22,939 --> 00:15:25,206
- What?
- And for fleeing.

215
00:15:25,207 --> 00:15:28,044
We didn't flee. We were abducted.

216
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,146
My gosh.

217
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:33,616
There he is. Any comments?

218
00:15:37,386 --> 00:15:38,421
This place...

219
00:15:39,488 --> 00:15:41,790
is not about democracy at all.

220
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:43,625
They're forcing me to confess.

221
00:15:43,626 --> 00:15:45,994
Do you admit the charges?

222
00:15:45,995 --> 00:15:49,765
I spent my whole life working for TQ.

223
00:15:50,266 --> 00:15:52,001
I never stole money...

224
00:15:52,668 --> 00:15:54,503
and did nothing to apologize for.

225
00:15:55,271 --> 00:15:58,607
I believe that once the
investigation is over,

226
00:15:59,141 --> 00:16:03,713
you will see the truth that I am blameless.

227
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,214
What a joke.

228
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,316
(Park denies charges)

229
00:16:07,516 --> 00:16:09,685
It doesn't work like that.

230
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:13,155
We don't deal with the
buyers' promissory note.

231
00:16:13,189 --> 00:16:16,491
We can't tell you what the
current situation is.

232
00:16:16,492 --> 00:16:20,228
- Yes.
- We didn't get any notifications.

233
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,832
I can't tell you that just yet.

234
00:16:23,466 --> 00:16:26,435
Each manufacturer has their
own accounting team.

235
00:16:27,136 --> 00:16:30,472
No, their contract has
nothing to do with us.

236
00:16:30,473 --> 00:16:32,408
We only deal with the headquarters' files.

237
00:16:33,142 --> 00:16:34,176
Okay then.

238
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:38,080
We don't deal with the buyers' debts.

239
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,681
I'll transfer you.

240
00:16:39,682 --> 00:16:43,052
- This looks really bad.
- That's not our job.

241
00:16:43,219 --> 00:16:45,620
- Will we really go bankrupt?
- I'll put you through.

242
00:16:45,621 --> 00:16:48,223
It's possible, considering
our financial situation.

243
00:16:48,224 --> 00:16:51,926
- Could all the subsidiaries flop too?
- Call them.

244
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:54,196
The whole group could go belly-up.

245
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,299
Then we'll all lose our jobs.

246
00:16:57,366 --> 00:16:59,768
I hope it doesn't come to that.

247
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:02,404
We don't know enough...

248
00:17:02,405 --> 00:17:04,407
to tell you what's going on.

249
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:09,311
What's wrong with him now?

250
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:13,716
Myung Seok.

251
00:17:16,085 --> 00:17:17,086
What?

252
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:20,255
Are you upset?

253
00:17:20,256 --> 00:17:23,392
It's not about me. It's
about what's going on.

254
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:24,627
Like what?

255
00:17:24,727 --> 00:17:28,597
Will we and the subsidiaries
really all go bankrupt?

256
00:17:30,066 --> 00:17:32,668
There is a possibility.

257
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,707
I got you the papers and the files...

258
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:42,578
from Tanzania to stop this, so why...

259
00:17:42,878 --> 00:17:44,980
There's no hope at all.

260
00:17:45,581 --> 00:17:47,416
We're all ruined.

261
00:17:47,783 --> 00:17:50,386
Not yet. It's not that bad yet.

262
00:17:51,053 --> 00:17:52,287
We have to try.

263
00:17:52,288 --> 00:17:55,324
Try what? It's beyond saving now.

264
00:17:55,891 --> 00:17:58,594
Stop trying to give me hope.
That's even worse.

265
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,303
You begged us last time,

266
00:18:08,304 --> 00:18:10,238
so we gave you an extension.

267
00:18:10,239 --> 00:18:12,407
That was days ago and
now look what happened.

268
00:18:12,408 --> 00:18:14,008
This isn't about our finances.

269
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:15,910
It's about the chairman's arrest.

270
00:18:15,911 --> 00:18:18,080
Once the media frenzy dies down...

271
00:18:18,614 --> 00:18:20,115
It won't die down.

272
00:18:20,116 --> 00:18:21,716
News will keep coming.

273
00:18:21,717 --> 00:18:23,351
We're done making sacrifices.

274
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,186
Come up with a solution.

275
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,288
- We won't leave.
- Sort this out.

276
00:18:27,289 --> 00:18:29,791
- Have it solved.
- Why is this happening?

277
00:18:29,792 --> 00:18:33,294
I heard things are getting worse.

278
00:18:33,295 --> 00:18:35,131
We can't pay off all the loans...

279
00:18:35,231 --> 00:18:36,699
and promissory notes.

280
00:18:37,066 --> 00:18:40,702
Why did you just let all this happen?

281
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:44,707
We trust you and followed you this far.

282
00:18:44,974 --> 00:18:46,341
We want you to...

283
00:18:46,342 --> 00:18:49,712
come up with a realistic
and reasonable solution.

284
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:54,550
Even with all the directors,

285
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,685
there's nothing they can do.

286
00:18:57,586 --> 00:19:00,489
Tell me what you want me to do.

287
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:03,626
Put the embezzlement charges on my wife...

288
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:04,994
and instigation...

289
00:19:05,928 --> 00:19:08,230
on Director Cho.

290
00:19:09,665 --> 00:19:11,433
Tell those two women...

291
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,737
what I say word for word.

292
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:16,204
What do you mean?

293
00:19:16,205 --> 00:19:17,740
It's what he said.

294
00:19:17,873 --> 00:19:19,141
If they will...

295
00:19:19,608 --> 00:19:22,378
drop all the charges against me,

296
00:19:22,711 --> 00:19:24,413
I will prevent bankruptcy...

297
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,550
with my own assets, of course.

298
00:19:28,817 --> 00:19:29,818
In return,

299
00:19:30,219 --> 00:19:33,622
they must guarantee my
position as chairman.

300
00:19:34,223 --> 00:19:37,092
Tell them very clearly that...

301
00:19:37,193 --> 00:19:40,496
if this goes on, within two weeks,

302
00:19:40,996 --> 00:19:43,465
TQ Group will crumble to the ground.

303
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:47,536
He wants an answer within two days.

304
00:19:54,343 --> 00:19:56,545
He told me to give you a message.

305
00:19:56,912 --> 00:20:01,016
Tell Min Young that if she
confesses to instigation,

306
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:06,422
I will see to it that she
lives well after her release.

307
00:20:11,894 --> 00:20:14,863
He wants an answer within two days.

308
00:20:28,177 --> 00:20:29,245
What?

309
00:20:29,612 --> 00:20:32,414
That is what Director Cho said.

310
00:20:32,915 --> 00:20:34,583
Tell him this.

311
00:20:34,883 --> 00:20:37,486
If he wants me to take the fall for him,

312
00:20:37,853 --> 00:20:40,456
he must give me half of what is in...

313
00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:43,392
the account in Switzerland.

314
00:20:43,726 --> 00:20:44,994
If he won't,

315
00:20:45,561 --> 00:20:49,498
I'll open the proof that
shows he ordered the murder.

316
00:20:52,568 --> 00:20:53,869
She is...

317
00:20:55,104 --> 00:20:56,739
too greedy.

318
00:20:58,307 --> 00:21:02,011
Her inability to lie is
a poor as her greed.

319
00:21:02,378 --> 00:21:04,146
Proof that I ordered murder?

320
00:21:10,452 --> 00:21:14,189
This is giving me a headache.

321
00:21:14,723 --> 00:21:15,891
What shall I do?

322
00:21:16,925 --> 00:21:19,828
Deal with him when the time is right.

323
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,869
She wants an answer within two days.

324
00:21:32,141 --> 00:21:35,444
Will he stop the bankruptcy
with his slush fund?

325
00:21:35,978 --> 00:21:39,248
Yes, he's using that to
make a deal with me.

326
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:43,619
He's amazing. He really is.

327
00:21:43,752 --> 00:21:46,187
We're in big trouble, aren't we?

328
00:21:46,188 --> 00:21:48,923
According to my analysis, yes.

329
00:21:48,924 --> 00:21:50,525
Banks have been calling...

330
00:21:50,526 --> 00:21:53,294
in regard to promissory notes.

331
00:21:53,295 --> 00:21:56,799
There are three big promissory
notes due this week.

332
00:21:56,965 --> 00:21:59,468
If we can't pay, next week there will be...

333
00:22:00,969 --> 00:22:02,337
a cascade of bankruptcies.

334
00:22:02,338 --> 00:22:03,906
If it's that serious,

335
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,541
then I'll have to rethink
for the greater good.

336
00:22:06,542 --> 00:22:07,675
Ma'am...

337
00:22:07,676 --> 00:22:10,144
Just to have Chairman Park punished,

338
00:22:10,145 --> 00:22:12,247
- I can't let the employees lose...
- No.

339
00:22:12,514 --> 00:22:14,049
You see it in the movies.

340
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:16,919
If you give the criminal money...

341
00:22:17,219 --> 00:22:19,154
and helicopter...

342
00:22:19,488 --> 00:22:22,323
He kills the hostages and runs away.

343
00:22:22,324 --> 00:22:24,926
That's right. You can't cut him a deal.

344
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:26,595
I'm with him on that.

345
00:22:26,795 --> 00:22:29,598
If you make a deal with the
chairman to avoid trouble,

346
00:22:29,898 --> 00:22:32,067
the situation will get worse.

347
00:22:33,135 --> 00:22:35,037
You must stay strong.

348
00:22:35,337 --> 00:22:38,407
You have us even though
we have little power.

349
00:22:38,574 --> 00:22:40,409
You're doing something...

350
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,580
no board member could ever do.

351
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:46,882
I'm sorry.

352
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:49,251
And thank you.

353
00:22:59,228 --> 00:23:00,695
Thanks for the extension.

354
00:23:00,696 --> 00:23:03,065
Okay. Please send someone
to Accounting Department.

355
00:23:03,732 --> 00:23:04,900
Thank you.

356
00:23:06,835 --> 00:23:09,104
I got Hanjoo Bank to extend the deadline.

357
00:23:11,073 --> 00:23:12,740
Why did you wash your hair at work?

358
00:23:12,741 --> 00:23:15,176
I couldn't shower this morning
because I was too busy.

359
00:23:15,177 --> 00:23:17,379
It was so itchy. Now I feel refreshed.

360
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:18,713
What about the promissory notes?

361
00:23:18,714 --> 00:23:20,782
I think I can hold it off this once,

362
00:23:20,783 --> 00:23:22,518
but not for another time.

363
00:23:22,618 --> 00:23:24,119
That's final.

364
00:23:24,286 --> 00:23:26,889
I can't get any more
extensions from banks either.

365
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:29,224
We're at the end of our rope.

366
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:32,895
Not the chairman, but us.

367
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:38,434
Call my lawyer, please.

368
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:41,703
Why are you here again?

369
00:23:42,037 --> 00:23:45,072
The chairman wants a quick answer.

370
00:23:45,073 --> 00:23:46,141
Why?

371
00:23:46,308 --> 00:23:49,410
He's thinking about an alternative.

372
00:23:49,411 --> 00:23:52,080
That means he has an option, other than me.

373
00:23:52,714 --> 00:23:54,615
I can't give you any details.

374
00:23:54,616 --> 00:23:58,387
I haven't changed my mind.

375
00:23:58,554 --> 00:24:00,489
Can't you just give him what he wants?

376
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:05,193
If dad gets out, the company
will ride out the crisis.

377
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:06,895
We need to save the company first.

378
00:24:07,296 --> 00:24:10,832
I can't let him to continue
managing it poorly.

379
00:24:10,833 --> 00:24:13,501
It's not like you've done
anything right either.

380
00:24:13,502 --> 00:24:14,703
What have you done?

381
00:24:15,304 --> 00:24:17,104
You very well know that...

382
00:24:17,105 --> 00:24:19,274
Dad is the only one who
can clean up this mess.

383
00:24:19,408 --> 00:24:22,176
Please be rational and face the reality.

384
00:24:22,177 --> 00:24:24,346
- Myung Seok.
- Mom.

385
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:42,297
(Establishing Law and Order)

386
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:43,832
You're here.

387
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:46,167
Why did you call me?

388
00:24:46,168 --> 00:24:47,336
What do you mean why?

389
00:24:48,837 --> 00:24:50,706
Can't a father call his son?

390
00:24:52,441 --> 00:24:54,510
Didn't your mom say anything?

391
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,078
She needs to give an answer today.

392
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,346
I'm not sure.

393
00:24:58,347 --> 00:25:01,283
I heard what happened yesterday.

394
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:04,553
You're thinking more rationally than her.

395
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,320
It's not like that.

396
00:25:06,321 --> 00:25:09,925
You've come to think deeper
since you started working.

397
00:25:10,526 --> 00:25:11,827
No matter what,

398
00:25:13,195 --> 00:25:15,731
we have to protect what's ours.

399
00:25:16,565 --> 00:25:20,702
That way, you can inherit what's mine.

400
00:25:21,537 --> 00:25:23,605
The only one I can trust...

401
00:25:23,906 --> 00:25:26,141
in my family is...

402
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,279
you.

403
00:25:32,714 --> 00:25:33,782
Yes, Father.

404
00:25:37,352 --> 00:25:39,321
I have a message for you.

405
00:25:40,088 --> 00:25:43,725
He said 50 percent is too much.

406
00:25:44,593 --> 00:25:45,693
Then?

407
00:25:45,694 --> 00:25:48,396
40 percent. 20 percent
when you give consent...

408
00:25:48,397 --> 00:25:51,599
and the other 20 percent when
the chairman is released.

409
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,101
How can I trust him?

410
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:57,806
Haven't you trusted him
and worked with him?

411
00:26:01,376 --> 00:26:03,812
Is this what I get for trusting him?

412
00:26:07,583 --> 00:26:09,318
Now is your only chance.

413
00:26:09,585 --> 00:26:11,019
Will you accept his offer?

414
00:26:16,925 --> 00:26:18,093
I will.

415
00:26:28,904 --> 00:26:30,872
(Father)

416
00:26:33,108 --> 00:26:34,109
Yes, Father.

417
00:26:36,144 --> 00:26:37,179
Right now?

418
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,016
Okay. I'll be right there.

419
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:43,584
Where are you going?

420
00:26:43,585 --> 00:26:45,988
I'll be right back. Please wrap this up.

421
00:26:55,497 --> 00:26:56,565
Hands.

422
00:26:57,399 --> 00:26:58,400
Pardon?

423
00:26:59,134 --> 00:27:00,468
Give me your hands.

424
00:27:00,469 --> 00:27:02,971
My hands? Okay.

425
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:10,579
That's my Swiss bank account.

426
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,281
Send money there.

427
00:27:15,083 --> 00:27:16,852
You take care of the account.

428
00:27:18,186 --> 00:27:19,920
Father, how can I...

429
00:27:19,921 --> 00:27:21,156
Be careful.

430
00:27:21,623 --> 00:27:24,226
You should never get caught. If you do,

431
00:27:25,827 --> 00:27:27,996
I'll be finished and the money too.

432
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:31,066
Okay.

433
00:27:43,045 --> 00:27:44,446
My goodness.

434
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:54,322
(Chief Kim)

435
00:27:56,692 --> 00:27:58,794
Did my wife send you?

436
00:27:58,827 --> 00:28:00,996
Why did you make such a huge offer?

437
00:28:03,298 --> 00:28:04,866
I guess she...

438
00:28:05,567 --> 00:28:08,002
spilled the beans.

439
00:28:08,003 --> 00:28:10,839
Of course. Because we're the brain.

440
00:28:10,906 --> 00:28:13,542
I'm sure it's the answer I expected.

441
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:18,213
It's as you expected. She
declined your offer.

442
00:28:19,981 --> 00:28:20,982
By the way,

443
00:28:22,017 --> 00:28:24,352
I don't remember...

444
00:28:25,721 --> 00:28:27,756
the offer I made.

445
00:28:29,224 --> 00:28:31,292
If you tell me where your slush fund is...

446
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:33,495
I'll take it into consideration.

447
00:28:42,204 --> 00:28:45,073
Transfer... Transfer amount.

448
00:28:49,377 --> 00:28:50,612
This is crazy.

449
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:57,786
8, 3, 6.

450
00:29:02,124 --> 00:29:03,125
Transfer.

451
00:29:06,194 --> 00:29:07,295
Did it work?

452
00:29:11,099 --> 00:29:12,801
Yes, it's in.

453
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:16,504
Let's see.

454
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:19,907
It's 1,000 no 10,000...

455
00:29:19,908 --> 00:29:22,911
No, it's 100,000,000 dollars.

456
00:29:23,812 --> 00:29:25,147
100,000,000 dollars?

457
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,448
My gosh.

458
00:29:28,083 --> 00:29:30,218
Myung Seok.

459
00:29:31,386 --> 00:29:32,621
You just...

460
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:35,315
transferred Chairman Park
Hyun Do's slush fund...

461
00:29:36,391 --> 00:29:38,693
to Business Operations' reserve fund.

462
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,465
What did you say? I
couldn't hear clearly...

463
00:29:44,432 --> 00:29:46,301
I'm sorry, come again?

464
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:49,137
Let me ask you one thing.

465
00:29:50,238 --> 00:29:51,273
Why...

466
00:29:52,007 --> 00:29:54,709
are you working so hard? For what?

467
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,612
Because that's righteous...

468
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:01,216
and that's the principle?

469
00:30:02,918 --> 00:30:07,055
Because of my wife and you,
a company will be ruined.

470
00:30:07,422 --> 00:30:08,890
Many employees will...

471
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:11,693
lose their jobs.

472
00:30:11,927 --> 00:30:13,995
Many subcontractors will...

473
00:30:14,496 --> 00:30:15,897
go bankrupt.

474
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:20,769
People like you who follow principles...

475
00:30:21,002 --> 00:30:23,305
wreck the world.

476
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:24,773
No.

477
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:28,376
People who mistake greed for principles...

478
00:30:28,844 --> 00:30:30,512
wreck the world.

479
00:30:31,847 --> 00:30:34,148
Thanks to those who follow principles,

480
00:30:34,149 --> 00:30:35,851
the world goes around.

481
00:30:37,018 --> 00:30:38,420
Do you even have...

482
00:30:39,221 --> 00:30:41,122
a right to say that?

483
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:45,492
You've been greedier than anyone else.

484
00:30:45,493 --> 00:30:46,795
We've changed.

485
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:49,164
Especially after seeing how you lived.

486
00:30:49,698 --> 00:30:51,933
We decided not to be horrible like you.

487
00:30:54,135 --> 00:30:56,504
Km Seong Ryong, there's a call for you.

488
00:31:04,713 --> 00:31:05,747
Mr. Seo.

489
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:10,819
I thought you'd act wisely until the end.

490
00:31:12,587 --> 00:31:14,356
I made a foolish decision,

491
00:31:16,524 --> 00:31:18,326
but I believe the result
will be a wise one.

492
00:31:18,727 --> 00:31:20,328
If your decision is foolish,

493
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:23,198
then the result will be foolish too.

494
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:25,400
I'm not sure.

495
00:31:26,334 --> 00:31:29,371
What you just said doesn't
really intrigue me.

496
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,750
Chairman Park, you were
actually a man of integrity.

497
00:31:43,084 --> 00:31:46,220
- What?
- We only found 290 dollars...

498
00:31:46,221 --> 00:31:48,556
in your slush fund account in Switzerland.

499
00:31:48,924 --> 00:31:49,925
What?

500
00:31:50,725 --> 00:31:51,725
Is there any other news?

501
00:31:51,726 --> 00:31:53,227
I can't tell you who it is,

502
00:31:53,228 --> 00:31:55,696
but a certain person returned
a huge amount of money...

503
00:31:55,697 --> 00:31:58,967
into Business Operations' reserve fund.

504
00:31:59,801 --> 00:32:04,139
That is awesome. That's amazing.
We'll use it well.

505
00:32:04,806 --> 00:32:06,975
What are you talking about?

506
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:11,579
We will use this to a good use too.

507
00:32:13,248 --> 00:32:14,349
What should we do?

508
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:18,353
Do away with him. Find the
right time to do that.

509
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,826
I saw your face during the
first cross-examination.

510
00:32:25,226 --> 00:32:28,697
It looked like you were
greatly betrayed by him.

511
00:32:29,297 --> 00:32:31,265
If he really cared for you,

512
00:32:31,266 --> 00:32:33,334
he wouldn't have used you as a cover.

513
00:32:33,335 --> 00:32:36,771
You will receive about 20
to 25 years of sentence.

514
00:32:37,105 --> 00:32:40,375
When you get out, you'll be well over 60.

515
00:32:41,476 --> 00:32:44,212
Where will you use your money at that age?

516
00:32:44,946 --> 00:32:46,915
You'll be spending your
prime days in the prison.

517
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:53,355
So do as I say.

518
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:57,892
Cooperate. Your sentence
will be down to seven years.

519
00:32:58,493 --> 00:33:00,127
Do you mean it?

520
00:33:00,128 --> 00:33:02,230
I don't joke around with these things.

521
00:33:02,931 --> 00:33:05,166
Will you come with me, or no?

522
00:33:10,138 --> 00:33:11,806
Myung Seok, don't get me wrong.

523
00:33:12,374 --> 00:33:15,110
I'm not trying to take your father's money.

524
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:18,246
I'm trying to return it
to where it belongs.

525
00:33:20,048 --> 00:33:22,951
I heard you complained
to Ha Gyeong saying...

526
00:33:23,184 --> 00:33:25,120
nothing changed even after helping me.

527
00:33:25,186 --> 00:33:26,688
I didn't complain.

528
00:33:27,122 --> 00:33:29,824
This is the last thing
you will do to help me.

529
00:33:31,026 --> 00:33:33,795
Like I said, you don't have
to do it if you don't want.

530
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:36,097
You can live a grand life...

531
00:33:36,231 --> 00:33:38,732
with your father's money later on.

532
00:33:38,733 --> 00:33:40,201
I won't say anything.

533
00:33:40,535 --> 00:33:43,104
That's your life.

534
00:33:45,006 --> 00:33:48,376
I don't want to live that life.

535
00:33:48,843 --> 00:33:50,912
- Really? No?
- Yes.

536
00:33:51,212 --> 00:33:54,015
Then help me. I will make sure...

537
00:33:54,716 --> 00:33:56,918
you live a shameless life.

538
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,286
Hey!

539
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:02,824
Hey, stay calm. This is
a correctional center.

540
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:05,693
I will never...

541
00:34:06,528 --> 00:34:10,297
I will never let you get away with this.

542
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:12,332
How dare you take my money?

543
00:34:12,333 --> 00:34:15,102
- But 290 dollars are enough.
- That's quite a lot.

544
00:34:15,103 --> 00:34:16,438
What did you say?

545
00:34:18,406 --> 00:34:19,973
He's so scary. I'm leaving.

546
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:21,443
Let's run away.

547
00:34:28,283 --> 00:34:30,051
Unbelievable.

548
00:34:33,421 --> 00:34:34,888
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

549
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:36,624
- Great job, everyone.
- Yes.

550
00:34:40,962 --> 00:34:42,729
I still can't believe it.

551
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:44,599
We took the chairman's money.

552
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,835
I was going to bring Myung Seok,

553
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:50,370
but he said he was going home.
So I let him go.

554
00:34:50,371 --> 00:34:53,540
Good job. He probably wants to be here,

555
00:34:53,541 --> 00:34:55,275
but he probably isn't feeling well either.

556
00:34:55,276 --> 00:34:57,678
Our company isn't in a
danger anymore, right?

557
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:00,081
We took care of about 70
percent of the problems.

558
00:35:00,949 --> 00:35:04,618
You really put everything
into this to make it work.

559
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:09,389
Anyway, great work, Mr.
Seo and Seong Ryong.

560
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:13,027
It's all thanks to your support.

561
00:35:14,963 --> 00:35:16,330
You're good at faking compliments.

562
00:35:16,331 --> 00:35:18,032
I'm not faking it.

563
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:19,567
Stop winking at me.

564
00:35:20,235 --> 00:35:21,769
Don't try to kiss me.

565
00:35:22,237 --> 00:35:23,438
I hate that tongue.

566
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:27,142
I'm sorry to bring this up right now.

567
00:35:27,475 --> 00:35:29,444
But can we order another dish?

568
00:35:37,418 --> 00:35:38,719
Go ahead.

569
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,722
You always do this.

570
00:35:49,364 --> 00:35:50,532
Honey.

571
00:35:58,406 --> 00:35:59,574
Soo Jin.

572
00:36:00,308 --> 00:36:01,309
Honey.

573
00:36:02,043 --> 00:36:03,244
Eun Seok.

574
00:36:03,945 --> 00:36:04,946
Honey.

575
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:07,415
Honey.

576
00:36:11,953 --> 00:36:13,254
What will you do now?

577
00:36:16,024 --> 00:36:17,292
Well, I'll get ready...

578
00:36:18,226 --> 00:36:19,794
to leave.

579
00:36:20,128 --> 00:36:22,230
You're finally leaving.

580
00:36:22,664 --> 00:36:23,764
What will you do?

581
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:26,568
I haven't thought about it.

582
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:30,205
I'll give myself a break.

583
00:36:30,505 --> 00:36:33,474
I got too tired from acting as Mr.
Righteous.

584
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:36,211
I guess it's a vacation for Mr. Righteous.

585
00:36:36,511 --> 00:36:37,745
Yes, something like that.

586
00:36:38,546 --> 00:36:40,315
What will you do?

587
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,616
I heard the district attorney
asked you to return.

588
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:43,784
I don't want to.

589
00:36:43,785 --> 00:36:46,788
Why not? You look like
a real prosecutor now.

590
00:36:46,888 --> 00:36:47,922
No.

591
00:36:48,356 --> 00:36:51,826
I'm looking for something that's cooler.

592
00:36:53,194 --> 00:36:54,195
Anyway.

593
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:58,132
I thought I needed to tell you this.

594
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:00,301
Kim Seong Ryong,

595
00:37:00,935 --> 00:37:05,440
you are the best Chief Kim
in this entire country.

596
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:10,511
Then let me tell you this.

597
00:37:11,012 --> 00:37:12,013
Seo Yul is...

598
00:37:12,614 --> 00:37:16,451
the best prosecutor,
director and a glutton...

599
00:37:17,752 --> 00:37:18,853
in this country.

600
00:37:24,225 --> 00:37:27,094
- My goodness!
- That was so gross.

601
00:37:27,095 --> 00:37:28,695
Even my limbs feel weird.

602
00:37:28,696 --> 00:37:29,797
Just go.

603
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:31,032
Get out of here.

604
00:37:31,466 --> 00:37:32,767
Let's never meet again.

605
00:37:33,067 --> 00:37:34,102
Accused.

606
00:37:35,236 --> 00:37:37,772
Do you have any last words?

607
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:43,144
What it means to run a company
in this country is...

608
00:37:43,911 --> 00:37:47,715
like sailing through rough
seas 365 days a year.

609
00:37:48,283 --> 00:37:51,185
To overcome a large wave,

610
00:37:51,452 --> 00:37:53,220
sometimes sacrifices are necessary.

611
00:37:53,221 --> 00:37:56,090
And unavoidable decisions
are necessary as well.

612
00:37:56,324 --> 00:38:00,093
I just prepared myself a
secondary solution...

613
00:38:00,094 --> 00:38:02,897
to be ready for such a situation.

614
00:38:03,064 --> 00:38:06,067
It was something I did for
everyone in TQ Group.

615
00:38:07,669 --> 00:38:11,838
That is why I do not admit these charges...

616
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:15,076
put together maliciously to attack me.

617
00:38:16,077 --> 00:38:18,046
I will lodge an appeal.

618
00:38:22,517 --> 00:38:27,121
This case clearly shows the corruptions...

619
00:38:27,522 --> 00:38:30,024
of conglomerates in this nation.

620
00:38:30,291 --> 00:38:32,894
Also, we believe there
is no way to explain...

621
00:38:32,994 --> 00:38:36,998
how they committed inhumane crimes...

622
00:38:37,098 --> 00:38:40,268
for the sake of their business.

623
00:38:40,702 --> 00:38:42,169
We considered...

624
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:46,139
the effects this case had on the society...

625
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:49,810
and we have the intention
of establishing...

626
00:38:49,811 --> 00:38:52,080
enterprises with morals as
we announce the verdict.

627
00:38:52,547 --> 00:38:55,449
Park Hyun Do is..

628
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:57,151
Sentenced to 22 years in prison.

629
00:38:59,153 --> 00:39:02,056
Cho Min Young is sentenced
to seven years in prison.

630
00:39:02,824 --> 00:39:05,693
Go Man Geun is sentenced
to four years in prison.

631
00:39:05,993 --> 00:39:10,131
Lee Gang Sik is sentenced
to three years in prison.

632
00:39:25,012 --> 00:39:26,381
Unavoidable decisions?

633
00:39:28,683 --> 00:39:29,684
A secondary solution?

634
00:39:31,552 --> 00:39:33,019
Why would you put money in your pocket...

635
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,721
to resolve a situation?

636
00:39:34,722 --> 00:39:36,824
You should be giving money
to save your company.

637
00:39:41,596 --> 00:39:42,597
Let's go.

638
00:39:43,231 --> 00:39:45,133
If you ever get out,

639
00:39:46,267 --> 00:39:47,969
don't ever take money...

640
00:39:49,237 --> 00:39:50,772
from the powerless ones.

641
00:39:51,706 --> 00:39:53,775
- Understood?
- Hey!

642
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:56,277
Go away, you jerk!

643
00:39:56,711 --> 00:39:58,045
You jerk!

644
00:39:58,346 --> 00:40:00,380
Go, you jerk!

645
00:40:00,381 --> 00:40:01,816
I was about to leave.

646
00:40:07,922 --> 00:40:10,024
You did very well, Ga Eun.

647
00:40:10,958 --> 00:40:12,093
It's nothing.

648
00:40:12,293 --> 00:40:15,296
It was an honor for me to
take part in this case.

649
00:40:16,764 --> 00:40:17,765
Prosecutor Han.

650
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,401
My gosh.

651
00:40:21,936 --> 00:40:24,806
I have a present. I almost forgot.

652
00:40:25,072 --> 00:40:26,073
I see.

653
00:40:30,278 --> 00:40:33,047
I sent a picture to you both.
You should check.

654
00:40:41,055 --> 00:40:43,990
I think that can become a huge case.

655
00:40:43,991 --> 00:40:45,693
Make a use of that...

656
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:48,229
and go get him.

657
00:40:48,329 --> 00:40:49,497
Mr. Kim, that's awesome.

658
00:40:53,234 --> 00:40:54,902
Hey, Mr. Kim.

659
00:40:58,306 --> 00:41:00,507
- Sir!
- It's me, Mr. Kim.

660
00:41:00,508 --> 00:41:03,310
- He's from Gunsan.
- When were you freed?

661
00:41:03,311 --> 00:41:04,978
I was there for only a bit.

662
00:41:04,979 --> 00:41:06,914
It's not like I killed someone.

663
00:41:07,949 --> 00:41:12,119
Anyway, you pulled out a huge case.

664
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,920
You destroyed TQ Group.

665
00:41:13,921 --> 00:41:18,259
I just had to scold them a bit.

666
00:41:20,461 --> 00:41:22,729
Look at your spirit and confidence.

667
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:25,800
This is why I love you.

668
00:41:26,434 --> 00:41:28,836
Anyway, what brings you here?

669
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,305
That's right.

670
00:41:31,706 --> 00:41:35,176
I'm here because I need your help.

671
00:41:35,309 --> 00:41:36,676
- Where?
- Yesterday,

672
00:41:36,677 --> 00:41:38,880
I bought two clubs in the north of Seoul.

673
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,349
I need a manager.

674
00:41:41,682 --> 00:41:43,517
How about Mr. Ku or Mr. Lee?

675
00:41:43,518 --> 00:41:46,586
Those two lack the brain power.

676
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:50,324
Only you can deal with the Seoul slickers.

677
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:54,462
The conditions are the usual.
The basic pay plus...

678
00:41:54,896 --> 00:41:58,132
whatever you want to take as an incentive.

679
00:42:07,675 --> 00:42:08,776
Whatever I want?

680
00:42:08,876 --> 00:42:13,381
(Chairperson Jang Yoo Seon)

681
00:42:13,581 --> 00:42:16,517
(Resignation)

682
00:42:19,387 --> 00:42:21,589
Personally, I don't want to accept this.

683
00:42:22,056 --> 00:42:26,093
You're the most talented
executive we have left.

684
00:42:26,761 --> 00:42:28,362
Can't you stay?

685
00:42:29,764 --> 00:42:32,800
Regardless of my capabilities,
I have no right to stay.

686
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,236
You aren't the person you
were when you started here.

687
00:42:37,605 --> 00:42:41,309
I need to spend a little time for myself.

688
00:42:43,177 --> 00:42:45,513
I need some time to learn to be...

689
00:42:46,447 --> 00:42:47,982
a decent person.

690
00:42:51,118 --> 00:42:54,322
Okay. When you think you are decent enough,

691
00:42:55,122 --> 00:42:56,657
come and see me.

692
00:42:56,958 --> 00:42:57,959
Thank you...

693
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:01,028
for everything.

694
00:43:04,332 --> 00:43:06,434
(Resignation)

695
00:43:22,383 --> 00:43:24,652
Are you really going to leave?

696
00:43:25,319 --> 00:43:27,421
Yes. I said I would.

697
00:43:28,089 --> 00:43:29,256
Chief.

698
00:43:29,323 --> 00:43:31,492
What? I'm not going far away.

699
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:33,694
We aren't parting forever.

700
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:37,331
Thanks for staying with us.

701
00:43:38,466 --> 00:43:39,467
I liked it.

702
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:42,236
I felt proud too.

703
00:43:42,903 --> 00:43:45,439
Thank you so much for everything.

704
00:43:46,507 --> 00:43:47,508
Chief.

705
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:50,111
Are you really leaving?

706
00:43:52,446 --> 00:43:54,315
Don't do that.

707
00:43:54,649 --> 00:43:56,850
You're making me feel weird.

708
00:43:56,851 --> 00:44:00,154
You're good at ruining the mood. Get going.

709
00:44:00,287 --> 00:44:01,422
You jerk.

710
00:44:05,092 --> 00:44:06,826
You'll work in Suyu-dong?

711
00:44:06,827 --> 00:44:08,796
Yes, not so far from here.

712
00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:13,033
You won't sneak off to Denmark, will you?

713
00:44:13,034 --> 00:44:16,303
I'm so over with Denmark now.
I prefer Korea.

714
00:44:18,806 --> 00:44:19,807
Seong Ryong.

715
00:44:22,943 --> 00:44:26,247
Thanks so much for helping us out.

716
00:44:27,381 --> 00:44:28,516
I mean it.

717
00:44:33,454 --> 00:44:36,157
I should be thanking you.

718
00:44:38,125 --> 00:44:41,228
You made me a decent human being.

719
00:44:48,436 --> 00:44:51,338
This is getting too sad.
I can't deal with it.

720
00:44:51,639 --> 00:44:54,474
I'll be too busy to come
around for a while.

721
00:44:54,475 --> 00:44:58,112
I'll pay a visit once I
settle down and become free.

722
00:45:00,047 --> 00:45:01,082
Take care.

723
00:45:41,055 --> 00:45:44,225
Come back the second you
think it's wrong for you.

724
00:45:46,293 --> 00:45:49,263
You'll have found a replacement by then.

725
00:45:49,463 --> 00:45:50,498
No.

726
00:45:50,965 --> 00:45:53,233
You're TQ Psycho, our mascot.

727
00:45:53,234 --> 00:45:54,702
There's always an opening.

728
00:45:55,302 --> 00:45:56,603
For the next one year,

729
00:45:56,604 --> 00:45:59,440
don't call me TQ Psycho or Mr. Righteous.

730
00:46:05,146 --> 00:46:07,982
I will think of you a lot.

731
00:46:08,949 --> 00:46:10,017
Me too.

732
00:46:11,285 --> 00:46:12,319
I think...

733
00:46:13,387 --> 00:46:15,256
I'll never forget this place.

734
00:46:17,324 --> 00:46:18,425
I should go.

735
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:19,894
Bye.

736
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:23,931
Chief Kim.

737
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:37,044
I just wanted to call you.

738
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:38,913
One last time.

739
00:47:10,878 --> 00:47:12,980
What lovely weather.

740
00:47:25,459 --> 00:47:29,029
(Chief Kim)

741
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:36,302
Political kingmaker and big shot Cha Gi Ho,

742
00:47:36,303 --> 00:47:38,137
a former leader of the Sinkwang Party...

743
00:47:38,138 --> 00:47:40,741
was arrested for bribery and tax evasion.

744
00:47:40,975 --> 00:47:44,278
Mr. Choi, his right-hand
man and assistant...

745
00:47:44,378 --> 00:47:46,780
was arrested for blackmail and abduction.

746
00:47:47,181 --> 00:47:49,582
They committed numerous
crimes to influence...

747
00:47:49,583 --> 00:47:51,085
political affairs and people,

748
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:53,921
and even threatened
family members for money.

749
00:47:54,421 --> 00:47:55,588
They took gifts worth...

750
00:47:55,589 --> 00:47:58,524
hundreds and thousands of dollars,

751
00:47:58,525 --> 00:48:01,028
and did favors in return for payments.

752
00:48:10,738 --> 00:48:12,506
You still haven't forgiven me.

753
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:17,244
Sorry, Dad.

754
00:48:18,712 --> 00:48:20,347
Do you think one apology...

755
00:48:20,614 --> 00:48:23,450
is enough to melt away my anger?

756
00:48:23,751 --> 00:48:24,985
No.

757
00:48:25,753 --> 00:48:29,156
I know that you will never forgive me.

758
00:48:30,858 --> 00:48:32,960
But Dad, you know...

759
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:35,429
It's the first time I ever felt this way.

760
00:48:38,899 --> 00:48:42,603
Now I think I can finally
live like a decent human.

761
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:44,204
Good for you...

762
00:48:44,605 --> 00:48:48,008
for selling out your dad
to become a decent human.

763
00:48:48,108 --> 00:48:51,278
No, Dad, I didn't sell you out.

764
00:48:51,578 --> 00:48:53,213
In your stead,

765
00:48:53,781 --> 00:48:56,583
I admitted our wrong to the public.

766
00:48:56,850 --> 00:49:00,087
Asking for forgiveness is
the decent thing to do.

767
00:49:01,322 --> 00:49:03,790
Not living like you...

768
00:49:03,791 --> 00:49:05,693
is decent.

769
00:49:16,603 --> 00:49:19,506
Hello, I am Jang Yoo Seon.

770
00:49:19,606 --> 00:49:22,742
To ensure that TQ Group
is ran transparently,

771
00:49:22,743 --> 00:49:24,210
we are hiring...

772
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:27,081
a CFO and accept
applications from everyone.

773
00:49:27,581 --> 00:49:30,016
Through a fair process,
we plan to select...

774
00:49:30,017 --> 00:49:33,721
a CFO who will lead us
morally and effectively.

775
00:49:33,921 --> 00:49:37,891
I promise TQ Group will
become even more stronger.

776
00:49:37,992 --> 00:49:39,025
(Director's Office)

777
00:49:39,026 --> 00:49:40,994
This is old-fashioned.

778
00:49:40,995 --> 00:49:42,262
(Choo Nam Ho)

779
00:49:43,831 --> 00:49:48,134
Who cares about where and
how well they studied?

780
00:49:48,135 --> 00:49:51,204
We want skills and amicability
and things like that.

781
00:49:51,205 --> 00:49:54,974
The person you recommended
is complicated and...

782
00:49:54,975 --> 00:49:58,045
Mr. Park, it's a temporary position.

783
00:49:58,312 --> 00:50:00,580
Let's give him a shot.

784
00:50:00,581 --> 00:50:02,316
If it doesn't work out, then fine.

785
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:04,785
Sorry.

786
00:50:05,819 --> 00:50:06,854
Hello, honey.

787
00:50:08,122 --> 00:50:09,623
No, I'm free.

788
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:13,093
Do you want me home early? Okay.

789
00:50:13,827 --> 00:50:17,531
It's Friday. Dinner and
a movie sounds fine.

790
00:50:17,998 --> 00:50:21,535
No, hang on, did I have plans?

791
00:50:22,236 --> 00:50:23,836
Where's my phone?

792
00:50:23,837 --> 00:50:25,039
Sir.

793
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:27,173
Right.

794
00:50:27,174 --> 00:50:30,511
Let me check and call you back.

795
00:50:31,512 --> 00:50:33,513
When did your wife and daughter return?

796
00:50:33,514 --> 00:50:34,847
A month ago.

797
00:50:34,848 --> 00:50:36,682
You must be so pleased.

798
00:50:36,683 --> 00:50:37,918
I am.

799
00:50:38,385 --> 00:50:40,054
You can go.

800
00:50:40,654 --> 00:50:41,822
Thanks.

801
00:50:45,793 --> 00:50:47,528
Was it nicer without them?

802
00:50:49,063 --> 00:50:50,130
We hired...

803
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:55,335
a new contract worker to join our team.

804
00:50:56,537 --> 00:50:57,537
Say hello.

805
00:51:00,707 --> 00:51:02,209
Hello, everyone.

806
00:51:03,677 --> 00:51:06,146
You all know me, don't you?

807
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:09,149
I won't be bringing your coffees anymore.

808
00:51:12,519 --> 00:51:15,656
I'm here to add numbers. Thank you.

809
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:18,325
You're so unfriendly.

810
00:51:22,629 --> 00:51:23,630
Good luck.

811
00:51:29,736 --> 00:51:31,737
Don't throw used tissues around.

812
00:51:31,738 --> 00:51:34,307
Look at all these trash.

813
00:51:34,308 --> 00:51:36,343
Do you want to get buried in trash?

814
00:51:36,877 --> 00:51:39,912
It's because the air is
terrible and I'm have allergy.

815
00:51:39,913 --> 00:51:43,050
We should've moved to 17th
floor when they offered.

816
00:51:45,252 --> 00:51:46,519
Chief, you regret not moving, right?

817
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:49,389
No. I like this place. It feels like home.

818
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:50,823
Right, General Manager?

819
00:51:50,824 --> 00:51:51,825
Right.

820
00:51:52,593 --> 00:51:55,761
I feel comfortable here.

821
00:51:55,762 --> 00:51:59,132
I don't think I can work in
an office with sunlight.

822
00:51:59,133 --> 00:52:00,701
It'd be too bright.

823
00:52:01,435 --> 00:52:05,305
Mold and dampness became a real family.

824
00:52:07,574 --> 00:52:10,209
Dear mold and dampness, stay here.

825
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:13,379
If you go to 17th floor,
you won't see me often.

826
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,015
What do you think?

827
00:52:15,415 --> 00:52:16,416
Okay.

828
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:21,121
Everyone, I'm here.

829
00:52:21,255 --> 00:52:22,756
- Goodness.
- Honey.

830
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:25,993
I passed the interview.

831
00:52:26,093 --> 00:52:28,529
Starting today, I'm an accounting intern.

832
00:52:28,729 --> 00:52:29,863
I'm an office worker now.

833
00:52:32,966 --> 00:52:35,235
Give her a hand.

834
00:52:35,802 --> 00:52:39,505
- Thank you.
- Goodness.

835
00:52:39,506 --> 00:52:40,706
Clap.

836
00:52:40,707 --> 00:52:44,011
- You're embarrassing me.
- Quiet.

837
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:47,880
You must be quiet in the office.

838
00:52:47,881 --> 00:52:49,349
Honey, are you okay?

839
00:52:50,784 --> 00:52:52,953
- She scared me.
- Is your voice okay?

840
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:56,690
Don't listen to her. Why
are you scaring her?

841
00:52:56,823 --> 00:52:57,824
Say what?

842
00:52:58,959 --> 00:53:00,994
I won't tolerate insubordination.

843
00:53:01,695 --> 00:53:03,630
I won't tolerate you, period.

844
00:53:13,907 --> 00:53:17,377
Don't worry. I'll make sure
the witness is protected.

845
00:53:18,946 --> 00:53:20,814
Don't regret what you did.

846
00:53:20,914 --> 00:53:22,516
Whistle-blowing was the right choice.

847
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:26,486
I'll get the proof from you
without anyone knowing.

848
00:53:29,323 --> 00:53:30,324
Hi.

849
00:53:37,197 --> 00:53:38,365
Enjoy.

850
00:53:38,699 --> 00:53:40,333
Give us some garlic sauce.

851
00:53:40,334 --> 00:53:41,335
Okay.

852
00:53:48,675 --> 00:53:51,511
Isn't it time you quit
being a public defender?

853
00:53:52,012 --> 00:53:54,982
You said you'd only volunteer for a year.

854
00:53:56,083 --> 00:53:58,485
After I wrap up the case I have now.

855
00:54:07,094 --> 00:54:10,330
- What's this?
- It's a CFO application form.

856
00:54:11,431 --> 00:54:13,533
You are the person...

857
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:15,802
our company needs.

858
00:54:19,006 --> 00:54:20,173
I'll think about it.

859
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:35,055
Next applicant, please.

860
00:54:43,497 --> 00:54:44,598
Hello.

861
00:54:45,632 --> 00:54:48,135
I'm Seo Yul. I applied for CFO position.

862
00:54:58,278 --> 00:55:00,580
Well, your book...

863
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:04,950
should be nominated for Best Screenplay.

864
00:55:04,951 --> 00:55:06,720
It has a great composition.

865
00:55:08,021 --> 00:55:10,290
It's very coherent.

866
00:55:12,292 --> 00:55:14,061
- I'm so sorry, sir.
- I'm sorry.

867
00:55:14,428 --> 00:55:16,396
Don't be sorry.

868
00:55:16,496 --> 00:55:18,332
Repeat after me.

869
00:55:19,299 --> 00:55:20,933
- Ripping off has...
- A limit!

870
00:55:20,934 --> 00:55:22,635
- Don't rip off...
- The weak!

871
00:55:22,636 --> 00:55:25,004
That's right. It's okay
to pocket a bit of...

872
00:55:25,005 --> 00:55:27,040
your boss' money.

873
00:55:27,474 --> 00:55:31,410
But if you get caught taking money from...

874
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:34,047
the waiters and the kitchen workers,

875
00:55:34,781 --> 00:55:35,882
you're dead.

876
00:55:36,883 --> 00:55:38,485
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

877
00:55:39,786 --> 00:55:41,154
- You may go.
- Yes, sir.

878
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:48,195
They're cute.

879
00:55:48,462 --> 00:55:50,197
(Dome Nightclub)

880
00:55:58,939 --> 00:56:00,474
(Dome Nightclub)

881
00:56:03,844 --> 00:56:04,945
Chief Kim Seong Ryong!

882
00:56:09,683 --> 00:56:12,652
Yes? I'm Kim Seong Ryong.

883
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:19,393
I'm Prosecutor Park Yong Tae, FIUs.

884
00:56:20,227 --> 00:56:23,397
I haven't done anything wrong.
I've been super good.

885
00:56:24,131 --> 00:56:26,032
I guess you feel guilty.

886
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:27,934
I'm not here to arrest you.

887
00:56:28,135 --> 00:56:29,202
Then why are you here?

888
00:56:30,737 --> 00:56:32,705
I have a favor to ask.

889
00:56:32,706 --> 00:56:33,706
A favor?

890
00:56:36,443 --> 00:56:39,011
I'm investigating a public
enterprise accounting fraud.

891
00:56:39,012 --> 00:56:40,613
I need someone...

892
00:56:40,614 --> 00:56:43,683
who'll go undercover and get information.

893
00:56:48,021 --> 00:56:50,157
Why are you asking me to do that?

894
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:53,226
Chief Kim Seong Ryong, please help me.

895
00:56:53,994 --> 00:56:55,929
How can you trust me?

896
00:56:56,263 --> 00:56:58,731
Do you know me? Do you know who I am?

897
00:56:58,732 --> 00:57:01,134
Lawyer Seo Yul and
Prosecutor Han Dong Hoon...

898
00:57:01,334 --> 00:57:03,336
recommended you.

899
00:57:04,204 --> 00:57:06,006
Those jerks.

900
00:57:07,741 --> 00:57:09,776
Please help me.

901
00:57:14,347 --> 00:57:16,316
I'm sorry. No.

902
00:57:17,050 --> 00:57:19,352
Chief, I beg you. Please help me.

903
00:57:21,221 --> 00:57:22,255
No.

904
00:57:22,889 --> 00:57:23,990
Chief.

905
00:57:44,244 --> 00:57:45,479
(If something is not right, )

906
00:57:46,112 --> 00:57:47,380
(I'll be back!)

907
00:57:47,914 --> 00:57:49,182
(Chief Kim forever!)

908
00:57:49,983 --> 00:57:57,983
(We all are leading
characters of Chief Kim!)

909
00:58:02,362 --> 00:58:04,998
(We made Chief Kim together!)
