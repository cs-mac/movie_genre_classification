1
00:00:52,035 --> 00:00:54,866
I am actress Milla Jovovich,
and I will be portraying.

2
00:00:54,937 --> 00:00:57,236
Dr. Abigail Tyler
in The Fourth Kind.

3
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:58,672
This film is a dramatization

4
00:00:58,741 --> 00:01:02,142
of events that occurred October 1st
through the 9th of 2000,

5
00:01:02,212 --> 00:01:03,770
in the northern
Alaskan town of Nome.

6
00:01:03,846 --> 00:01:05,871
To better explain
the events of the story,

7
00:01:05,949 --> 00:01:07,507
the director has included actual

8
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:09,074
archived footage
throughout the film.

9
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:12,553
This footage was acquired from
Nome psychologist Dr. Abigail Tyler,

10
00:01:12,622 --> 00:01:17,218
who has personally documented over
65 hours of video and audio materials

11
00:01:17,293 --> 00:01:18,419
during the time of the incidents.

12
00:01:18,494 --> 00:01:20,359
To better protect their privacy,

13
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,261
we have changed
the names and professions

14
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:23,629
of many of the people involved.

15
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,168
Every dramatized scene
in this movie is supported

16
00:01:26,236 --> 00:01:28,295
by either archived audio, video,

17
00:01:28,371 --> 00:01:30,362
or as it was related
by Dr. Tyler

18
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,431
during extensive interviews
with the director.

19
00:01:32,508 --> 00:01:35,170
In the end, what you believe
is yours to decide.

20
00:01:35,245 --> 00:01:37,543
Please be advised
that some of what

21
00:01:37,614 --> 00:01:40,481
you are about to see
is extremely disturbing.

22
00:01:41,651 --> 00:01:45,382
Just relax,
and I'll ask you questions,

23
00:01:45,455 --> 00:01:47,013
and whenever, whatever
you want to toss in there.

24
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:48,580
Okay. You all right?

25
00:01:48,658 --> 00:01:49,750
Okay.

26
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:51,417
I'm going to try

27
00:01:51,494 --> 00:01:56,227
and make this as painless
as possible.

28
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,532
Can you state your
name for the camera?

29
00:01:59,669 --> 00:02:02,160
Dr. Abigail Emily Tyler.

30
00:02:03,573 --> 00:02:06,098
Okay, where would
you like to begin?

31
00:02:07,176 --> 00:02:08,507
I guess..

32
00:02:10,346 --> 00:02:14,874
After what happened with Will,
my husband, I..

33
00:02:16,085 --> 00:02:20,249
I went to my friend, who is
also a psychologist, Dr..

34
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:26,022
because I was having trouble
dealing with how he..

35
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:30,055
With how it happened
and who did it.

36
00:02:31,167 --> 00:02:34,034
You don't think you might
need more time?

37
00:02:34,103 --> 00:02:37,455
No, this is something..

38
00:02:38,353 --> 00:02:40,355
I have to do this. I..

39
00:02:41,444 --> 00:02:43,969
I have to remember his face.

40
00:02:44,047 --> 00:02:46,914
I need it for myself to heal.

41
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:52,017
I have to try, and I have to
know that, for my children,

42
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:54,682
that I did everything
that I could

43
00:02:55,325 --> 00:02:57,520
to remember.
..to remember.

44
00:02:58,027 --> 00:03:01,292
You know, since that night,
Ashley still can't see,

45
00:03:02,165 --> 00:03:06,261
and I don't think that she's
gonna get her sight back

46
00:03:06,336 --> 00:03:09,897
if she doesn't accept
what happened.

47
00:03:12,475 --> 00:03:16,741
Well, I think you both have the same
problem, just different symptoms.

48
00:03:20,483 --> 00:03:22,644
Yeah, and I think
that it could help

49
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:25,483
if I could just remember
the face of that man,

50
00:03:26,356 --> 00:03:29,759
so we could somehow..
track him down and..

51
00:03:30,256 --> 00:03:31,819
set the record straight

52
00:03:33,529 --> 00:03:35,394
and find some closure.

53
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,497
All right. All right.

54
00:03:41,571 --> 00:03:43,732
Do you want it on video?

55
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:45,034
Yeah.

56
00:03:45,108 --> 00:03:46,315
Counseling..

57
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:49,905
a fellow psychologist is like..

58
00:03:50,279 --> 00:03:51,610
It's like talking to myself.

59
00:03:55,685 --> 00:03:57,949
You always say that.

60
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,716
I do? My God.

61
00:04:03,693 --> 00:04:05,024
All right.

62
00:04:06,963 --> 00:04:11,559
I guess just try to relax and
get yourself comfortable.

63
00:04:13,236 --> 00:04:16,000
Listen to the sound of my voice
as I count back.

64
00:04:17,673 --> 00:04:18,731
10..

65
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:20,934
9..

66
00:04:21,677 --> 00:04:25,738
8, 7, 6..

67
00:04:26,282 --> 00:04:27,613
Your eyes are getting heavier..

68
00:04:27,683 --> 00:04:29,480
and heavier.

69
00:04:29,719 --> 00:04:32,347
5, 4.

70
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,221
They're almost closed.
They're almost closed.

71
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:38,124
3, 2

72
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:39,491
and 1.

73
00:04:39,562 --> 00:04:40,586
1.

74
00:04:44,801 --> 00:04:46,859
Very good, Abbey.
Very good.

75
00:04:47,236 --> 00:04:50,463
Let's go back in time..

76
00:04:51,107 --> 00:04:54,354
back into the past..

77
00:04:55,144 --> 00:04:59,870
to the night of August 2nd
of this year.

78
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,381
What was the weather like?

79
00:05:02,452 --> 00:05:05,683
Warm.
Warmer than usual,

80
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,757
even though it's raining outside.

81
00:05:11,727 --> 00:05:13,092
Okay, good.

82
00:05:14,297 --> 00:05:18,461
Now, let's go back to when
you were with Will,

83
00:05:19,535 --> 00:05:22,436
just before the intruder
entered your room.

84
00:05:24,474 --> 00:05:26,135
We're making love.

85
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:32,946
It's nice.
It's so.. It's so nice.

86
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:47,024
He's falling asleep.

87
00:05:50,366 --> 00:05:53,267
Good. So what happens..
What happened next?

88
00:05:53,703 --> 00:05:56,433
I'm awake.
I'm wide awake,

89
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:02,334
and we're just
lying here.

90
00:06:06,849 --> 00:06:08,407
What woke you up?

91
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:32,234
God!

92
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:36,176
Someone stabbed him
in the chest! My God!

93
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,446
Blood everywhere.
There's blood everywhere.

94
00:06:40,516 --> 00:06:42,814
Try to see his face.

95
00:06:42,885 --> 00:06:43,874
I can't see it.

96
00:06:43,953 --> 00:06:45,284
My husband!

97
00:06:45,354 --> 00:06:47,015
It just feels like I can't move.
I can't see it.

98
00:06:47,089 --> 00:06:49,080
It feels like we're frozen.
I can't see it.

99
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:52,821
Abbey. Abbey,
Abbey. Abbey.

100
00:06:52,895 --> 00:06:54,590
It's all over me!
All over me.

101
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,291
Focus on my voice.
Focus on my voice.

102
00:06:56,365 --> 00:06:58,526
You will be awakened
and conscious

103
00:06:58,601 --> 00:07:00,296
in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

104
00:07:05,608 --> 00:07:08,941
Abbey. Here. Let me.

105
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,707
If I could just see his face.

106
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,855
He was killed, and I
was right there, Abel.

107
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:17,784
I was right there.

108
00:07:18,754 --> 00:07:21,917
Yeah, you know,
it's as natural to feel guilt

109
00:07:21,991 --> 00:07:25,586
as it is unnatural to
feel it was your fault.

110
00:07:26,896 --> 00:07:28,386
You know that.

111
00:07:32,935 --> 00:07:34,596
Yeah, okay. Okay.

112
00:07:45,648 --> 00:07:49,175
I think you might want to
consider taking some time off.

113
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,043
Real time, you know?

114
00:07:52,688 --> 00:07:56,556
Because it just might help you
find clarity with what happened.

115
00:07:56,626 --> 00:08:00,062
I have to continue this study.
It meant a lot to Will,

116
00:08:02,331 --> 00:08:05,061
and he would have
wanted me to continue.

117
00:08:06,202 --> 00:08:07,965
Now, why did I know
you were gonna say that?

118
00:08:08,037 --> 00:08:09,698
He would have wanted me
to try and finish it

119
00:08:09,772 --> 00:08:12,002
as soon as I could.

120
00:08:12,642 --> 00:08:15,406
It meant a lot to him.

121
00:08:35,331 --> 00:08:37,663
And how long had it been
at this point

122
00:08:37,733 --> 00:08:40,827
since Will had passed away?

123
00:08:41,804 --> 00:08:43,169
2 months.

124
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:44,838
And you guys were already
back to school,

125
00:08:44,907 --> 00:08:46,568
and the kids were already
back to school?

126
00:08:46,642 --> 00:08:48,154
I had to try

127
00:08:48,652 --> 00:08:52,654
and get some
normality back into life.

128
00:08:53,182 --> 00:08:55,412
I didn't know what else to do.

129
00:09:03,693 --> 00:09:05,718
Is Nome a place you
can drive into or..

130
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,228
No, you have to fly around.

131
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:08,320
Okay.

132
00:09:08,397 --> 00:09:10,524
You can't get there by road.

133
00:10:07,456 --> 00:10:08,514
Any messages?

134
00:10:08,591 --> 00:10:10,252
No, but Scott's waiting
in your office,

135
00:10:10,326 --> 00:10:11,918
and you have
a 1:00 and a 2:00.

136
00:10:11,994 --> 00:10:13,325
Thank you.

137
00:10:13,429 --> 00:10:14,691
So, how was it coming in?

138
00:10:14,764 --> 00:10:16,629
It was a little bumpy.

139
00:10:17,133 --> 00:10:18,600
You'd think as beautiful
as that sky is

140
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:20,066
that it wouldn't be so rough.

141
00:10:20,136 --> 00:10:21,398
The stuff that really shakes us..

142
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:23,404
We seldom ever see coming.

143
00:10:23,472 --> 00:10:24,530
I know, I know.

144
00:10:24,607 --> 00:10:26,006
It's a good saying.

145
00:10:26,108 --> 00:10:27,632
Not every week.

146
00:10:28,677 --> 00:10:30,668
Hi, Scott.
Sorry I'm late.

147
00:10:30,746 --> 00:10:32,373
Hey, Dr. Tyler.

148
00:10:34,016 --> 00:10:35,847
I flew up to Anchorage
this morning,

149
00:10:35,918 --> 00:10:39,376
so I'm having a bit
of a slow start.

150
00:10:39,955 --> 00:10:43,015
Please, sit down and make
yourself comfortable.

151
00:10:53,435 --> 00:10:54,902
How are you?

152
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,096
I'm all right.

153
00:10:57,006 --> 00:10:58,906
Have you been sleeping?

154
00:11:00,176 --> 00:11:01,905
It's.. It's worse.

155
00:11:03,946 --> 00:11:07,473
I wake up in the middle of the night
almost every night,

156
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,647
and I just lie there.

157
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:12,579
What time does this
normally occur?

158
00:11:12,655 --> 00:11:14,782
Around 2:30, 3:00
in the morning.

159
00:11:16,058 --> 00:11:18,856
And there's nothing unusual
waking you up?

160
00:11:19,161 --> 00:11:20,560
No, nothing.

161
00:11:21,197 --> 00:11:23,893
It's just there's..
There's one thing.

162
00:11:25,901 --> 00:11:29,166
There's an owl at my window.

163
00:11:32,641 --> 00:11:33,835
An owl?

164
00:11:38,981 --> 00:11:40,459
A white owl.

165
00:11:41,851 --> 00:11:45,019
It was just looking at me.

166
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:50,055
How long was it there?

167
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:54,262
Hours.

168
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:57,663
No matter what I did,
it wouldn't fly away.

169
00:11:59,068 --> 00:12:00,968
It wasn't scared of me.

170
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,101
What was it doing?

171
00:12:09,345 --> 00:12:11,074
Just staring at me.

172
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,880
Had you ever seen it before?

173
00:12:22,591 --> 00:12:24,821
Yeah.

174
00:12:26,462 --> 00:12:28,430
Once when I was a kid.

175
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:29,930
That was the first time?

176
00:12:33,202 --> 00:12:35,295
I guess I've seen it a lot.

177
00:12:35,371 --> 00:12:36,861
How much is a lot?

178
00:12:36,939 --> 00:12:38,133
Every night this week.

179
00:12:38,207 --> 00:12:39,469
Every night?

180
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:43,778
You mean every time
you go to bed?

181
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,336
I think it came inside.

182
00:12:46,882 --> 00:12:48,406
Was your window open?

183
00:12:48,484 --> 00:12:49,576
No.

184
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:53,253
I wonder how it got in.

185
00:12:53,555 --> 00:12:56,820
I don't know, but I remember it
looking down at me.

186
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,459
Over your bed?

187
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:01,360
Yeah, I think so.
I..

188
00:13:02,665 --> 00:13:04,860
It's really hard to remember.

189
00:13:06,969 --> 00:13:10,735
It's almost like..
Like it didn't happen.

190
00:13:11,941 --> 00:13:14,671
Like, you know, in a dream.

191
00:13:17,446 --> 00:13:19,311
Like I just dreamt it.

192
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:23,111
Can you come see me tomorrow?

193
00:13:24,019 --> 00:13:28,115
Sure, if you think I should,
or if it's important.

194
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:31,648
Yeah, I do.
I do think it's important,

195
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:35,288
and it's nothing to be
alarmed at, at all,

196
00:13:37,232 --> 00:13:39,200
but there have been some
strange coincidences here,

197
00:13:39,268 --> 00:13:43,136
and I just.. I feel like I need
to try something new.

198
00:13:43,772 --> 00:13:45,205
What do you mean?

199
00:13:45,274 --> 00:13:46,935
You're not the first patient
I've had

200
00:13:47,009 --> 00:13:49,876
who's experienced
something like this.

201
00:14:19,908 --> 00:14:23,036
I felt so sorry for my baby,

202
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,779
and I feel responsible.

203
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,045
Can you just knock it off?

204
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,383
Conversion disorder
is not a phenomenon

205
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:34,513
that a lot of
people understand,

206
00:14:35,057 --> 00:14:37,890
and we've had to make
quite an adjustment.

207
00:14:40,095 --> 00:14:42,086
When did Ashley go blind?

208
00:14:42,765 --> 00:14:45,666
After what happened to Will,

209
00:14:45,734 --> 00:14:47,361
she just lost her sight.

210
00:14:55,711 --> 00:14:57,508
Hey, baby.

211
00:14:57,579 --> 00:14:58,841
Hi, Mommy.

212
00:14:59,782 --> 00:15:02,080
How was rehearsal
for the play?

213
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,745
Hey, what's wrong?

214
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:08,221
Nothing.

215
00:15:16,398 --> 00:15:17,626
Come on.

216
00:15:24,406 --> 00:15:26,931
Come on, cough it up.
What happened?

217
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:30,578
Ralph called me a faker.

218
00:15:30,646 --> 00:15:33,137
What? A faker?

219
00:15:33,582 --> 00:15:35,015
He said that I could see before,

220
00:15:35,084 --> 00:15:36,881
and now I was just pretending.

221
00:15:36,952 --> 00:15:37,976
What a jerk.

222
00:15:38,053 --> 00:15:39,520
He said that I just wanted
everybody

223
00:15:39,588 --> 00:15:42,614
to feel sorry for me
because of Daddy.

224
00:16:05,414 --> 00:16:08,178
Dear Lord, thank you
for everything we have.

225
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,275
Please continue
to bless our family,

226
00:16:10,853 --> 00:16:14,550
and please continue to help Ashley
overcome her challenges,

227
00:16:15,591 --> 00:16:17,650
and help all of us to heal.

228
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:20,160
In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

229
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,389
Amen.

230
00:16:26,401 --> 00:16:27,834
Hey, what time is the game
tomorrow?

231
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,302
7:00.

232
00:16:29,938 --> 00:16:32,372
And who are you playing again?

233
00:16:32,441 --> 00:16:34,136
I already told you, Browerville.

234
00:16:35,878 --> 00:16:38,870
Well, I'm sorry, sweetie.
I must have forgot.

235
00:16:40,782 --> 00:16:42,409
Dad never forgot.

236
00:16:47,122 --> 00:16:50,353
Yeah, and Dad's not here anymore.

237
00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:55,854
No, he's not.

238
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,100
Can you accept it yet?

239
00:17:02,171 --> 00:17:05,470
Okay, Ronnie, not in front of
your sister, okay?

240
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:07,304
We'll talk about it later.

241
00:17:07,376 --> 00:17:08,434
What do you mean?

242
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:09,807
Nothing, honey.

243
00:17:12,247 --> 00:17:13,305
How Dad died.

244
00:17:13,382 --> 00:17:15,145
All right, Ronnie.
What is wrong with you?

245
00:17:15,217 --> 00:17:17,151
You go around helping other
people with their problems..

246
00:17:17,219 --> 00:17:18,686
Stop it.
Stop it!

247
00:17:18,754 --> 00:17:20,187
But you can't even
help yourself.

248
00:17:20,255 --> 00:17:22,951
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

249
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,320
Ronnie.

250
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:30,689
Mommy?
What did..

251
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,795
What does he mean?

252
00:17:58,393 --> 00:18:00,827
And do you think he,
in any way,

253
00:18:00,896 --> 00:18:03,660
may have blamed you for
Will's death?

254
00:18:03,732 --> 00:18:05,529
Yes, he did blame me,

255
00:18:06,235 --> 00:18:07,954
and he said that..

256
00:18:08,155 --> 00:18:11,844
that I couldn't help.. him

257
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:15,802
or Ashley or anyone,
and he was right.

258
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,446
A small number
continue to experience

259
00:18:56,518 --> 00:18:59,646
debilitating sleep disorders,

260
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:02,815
and this seems to be the trend
throughout Nome,

261
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:05,917
and a cause remains unknown.

262
00:19:07,529 --> 00:19:10,589
Even during the night months,
they can't sleep.

263
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:13,863
We've seen over 300 people
throughout Nome

264
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:17,033
who are all exhibiting
the same symptoms.

265
00:19:17,105 --> 00:19:20,268
Around 3:00 in the morning, they are
awakened for no apparent reason,

266
00:19:20,342 --> 00:19:25,109
and they wake up apprehensive,
frightened, panicked,

267
00:19:26,348 --> 00:19:28,782
as if something's about to happen.

268
00:19:29,384 --> 00:19:30,373
Whether or not this is related..

269
00:19:30,452 --> 00:19:31,441
Daddy?

270
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,511
To the missing people
or disappearances..

271
00:19:33,588 --> 00:19:35,453
No, my baby,

272
00:19:35,524 --> 00:19:37,549
it's just a recording
of Daddy's voice.

273
00:19:39,628 --> 00:19:41,155
Come over here.

274
00:19:42,158 --> 00:19:45,265
I got you.
Come up on the bed.

275
00:19:48,804 --> 00:19:50,066
My angel.

276
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:04,710
Okay, you're doing
real good, Tommy.

277
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:10,224
When I get to one,
you will be asleep,

278
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,092
very, very relaxed.

279
00:20:15,664 --> 00:20:18,428
4, 3,

280
00:20:20,001 --> 00:20:24,097
2 and 1.

281
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,342
Can you hear me?

282
00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:39,111
Yes.

283
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:44,447
And when was the last time

284
00:20:44,526 --> 00:20:46,756
you had trouble sleeping?

285
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:49,895
Last night.

286
00:20:52,768 --> 00:20:54,736
And did you see the owl?

287
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:58,097
Yeah.

288
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:05,036
Good. And..

289
00:21:05,113 --> 00:21:06,478
what did it look like?

290
00:21:11,086 --> 00:21:12,246
Tommy?

291
00:21:13,822 --> 00:21:14,811
I..

292
00:21:16,792 --> 00:21:18,453
I don't remember.

293
00:21:18,994 --> 00:21:21,827
You don't remember
what the owl looks like?

294
00:21:22,631 --> 00:21:23,689
No.

295
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:26,066
No, I don't see the owl.

296
00:21:26,134 --> 00:21:28,068
I don't see the owl now.

297
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:30,359
It's not there anymore.

298
00:21:30,739 --> 00:21:32,728
Did it fly away?

299
00:21:33,141 --> 00:21:35,458
No, I think it's..
No,

300
00:21:35,859 --> 00:21:37,270
I think it's..

301
00:21:38,013 --> 00:21:43,654
I don't really remember it..

302
00:21:45,953 --> 00:21:49,547
ever being there.

303
00:21:58,667 --> 00:22:02,467
There's something outside my door.
It's gonna open it.

304
00:22:04,272 --> 00:22:06,832
The door's opening.

305
00:22:11,213 --> 00:22:12,407
My God.

306
00:22:12,814 --> 00:22:13,979
My God!

307
00:22:16,151 --> 00:22:17,948
No.

308
00:22:18,019 --> 00:22:19,350
What's wrong?

309
00:22:19,621 --> 00:22:21,418
Jesus!
Tommy, what's wrong?

310
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:22,855
No, no, no!

311
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:24,456
No, no!

312
00:22:24,826 --> 00:22:26,657
No, no, no! No, no, no!
Okay, Tommy, when I count to 3,

313
00:22:26,728 --> 00:22:27,717
you will awaken.

314
00:22:27,796 --> 00:22:28,990
No, no, no!

315
00:22:29,064 --> 00:22:30,224
To conscious..
No!

316
00:22:30,298 --> 00:22:31,560
3.

317
00:22:31,633 --> 00:22:33,498
No, no! No!

318
00:22:33,568 --> 00:22:35,092
3!
No!

319
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:39,005
Tommy, it's not happening.

320
00:22:39,074 --> 00:22:40,974
It's a memory.
This is not real.

321
00:22:41,176 --> 00:22:42,541
It is real.

322
00:22:48,917 --> 00:22:50,407
Did I do that?

323
00:22:52,721 --> 00:22:56,122
Yeah, you did, Tommy,
but it's okay. It's okay.

324
00:23:00,395 --> 00:23:02,022
What did you see?

325
00:23:02,898 --> 00:23:03,887
Nothing.

326
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:05,023
What?

327
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,659
Nothing.

328
00:23:07,736 --> 00:23:09,260
You said you saw something.

329
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:14,703
No, I didn't see anything.

330
00:23:16,411 --> 00:23:17,469
I didn't see anything.

331
00:23:17,546 --> 00:23:19,241
I'm just trying to help you.

332
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:24,013
If you want to help me,
get me out of this room.

333
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:32,324
I need to go home.
I'm okay. I'm okay.

334
00:23:32,627 --> 00:23:35,528
Tommy, are you trying
to convince me or you?

335
00:23:36,531 --> 00:23:39,432
Did you see what was
bothering you at night?

336
00:23:41,236 --> 00:23:42,999
Did you see the owl?

337
00:23:52,581 --> 00:23:56,108
Can we talk about this next time?

338
00:23:57,819 --> 00:24:00,014
Yeah, of course.
Sure.

339
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,818
Talk to me when you need to.

340
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:08,793
Yeah. Okay.

341
00:24:50,472 --> 00:24:53,566
Call in EMTs, Search, everybody.
I want everybody.

342
00:24:53,642 --> 00:24:57,544
Transfer me into that house.
Right now.

343
00:25:08,056 --> 00:25:09,045
Tommy here.

344
00:25:09,124 --> 00:25:10,955
Yeah, what's going on
in there?

345
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:12,558
I want to talk to Abbey Tyler.

346
00:25:12,627 --> 00:25:13,855
Abbey?

347
00:25:13,928 --> 00:25:16,294
Abbey's not here right now,
but I can help you.

348
00:25:16,364 --> 00:25:17,888
I have to talk to her!

349
00:25:23,004 --> 00:25:24,062
Hello?

350
00:25:24,139 --> 00:25:26,004
I need you down here
at Tommy's house.

351
00:25:26,541 --> 00:25:27,803
August?
He's gone crazy.

352
00:25:27,876 --> 00:25:30,242
He's holding his family hostage,
and he's asking for you.

353
00:25:30,345 --> 00:25:32,006
Okay, I'll be right there.

354
00:25:45,527 --> 00:25:46,516
<i>Bring her up here.</i>

355
00:25:46,594 --> 00:25:47,618
She's here right now.

356
00:25:47,696 --> 00:25:49,891
We'll walk her up to you, okay,
Tommy? It's gonna be all right.

357
00:25:49,964 --> 00:25:52,159
Just give her the phone.
I want to talk to her.

358
00:25:52,233 --> 00:25:54,201
Both arms out.
Both arms out. She's here.

359
00:25:54,269 --> 00:25:55,668
Put her on the phone right now.

360
00:25:55,737 --> 00:25:57,705
I'm gonna do it right now, okay?
Is this really necessary?

361
00:25:57,772 --> 00:25:59,672
I want to talk to her! Can somebody
tell me what's going on?

362
00:25:59,741 --> 00:26:00,765
Where is she?
Take it easy, all right?

363
00:26:00,842 --> 00:26:03,333
I don't see her. Get her up here!
August, what's going on?

364
00:26:03,411 --> 00:26:06,505
I need you to calm him down
and get him thinking rationally.

365
00:26:06,581 --> 00:26:08,776
He's got Sarah, Timothy
and Joe lined up

366
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:11,148
in the kitchen with
a gun to their heads,

367
00:26:11,219 --> 00:26:13,517
and he wants to talk to you
for some reason, all right?

368
00:26:13,588 --> 00:26:14,612
Watch your step.

369
00:26:14,689 --> 00:26:16,054
Straight this way.

370
00:26:16,124 --> 00:26:20,527
Tommy? Tommy, what..
What's going on here?

371
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:24,090
I'm so sorry,
but I've gotta do this.

372
00:26:26,067 --> 00:26:27,364
I don't have a choice.

373
00:26:27,435 --> 00:26:31,159
It was completely surreal

374
00:26:31,335 --> 00:26:33,239
to be there in the middle of the night

375
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:35,703
with all those police trucks.

376
00:26:35,877 --> 00:26:37,003
I don't have a choice.

377
00:26:37,078 --> 00:26:38,477
No, no, no.
You have a choice, Tommy.

378
00:26:38,546 --> 00:26:39,911
We always have a choice.

379
00:26:39,981 --> 00:26:41,676
Not this time.
Please, Tommy!

380
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,718
Yes. Yes, you do.
You have the choice

381
00:26:43,785 --> 00:26:46,253
right now to just..
To just stop.

382
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:49,084
Just put down the gun, Tommy.

383
00:26:49,157 --> 00:26:51,990
You have it within your power
to just stop.

384
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:54,153
Please, before somebody gets hurt.

385
00:26:54,229 --> 00:26:56,322
Tommy, look at Sarah, Tommy.

386
00:26:56,397 --> 00:26:57,864
Look at..
Look at your wife.

387
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,726
Look at your children, Tommy.

388
00:26:59,801 --> 00:27:00,825
It's okay.
It's okay.

389
00:27:00,902 --> 00:27:03,166
You would never let anything
happen to them.

390
00:27:03,238 --> 00:27:04,637
You love them so much.

391
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,936
I know what keeps us up
at night.

392
00:27:07,008 --> 00:27:10,466
And if you saw what I saw,

393
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:11,671
you would understand.

394
00:27:11,746 --> 00:27:13,714
What did you see, Tommy?

395
00:27:14,115 --> 00:27:15,582
It doesn't matter,
because we're not gonna

396
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:18,346
have to see it ever again.

397
00:27:18,586 --> 00:27:21,578
Just wait, Tommy.
I can help you.

398
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:24,817
Just talk to me, okay?
We'll talk as long as you need to.

399
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,155
We'll get through this, Tommy.

400
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:27,956
If anybody's got a clear shot,
take it now.

401
00:27:28,029 --> 00:27:29,087
Negative.

402
00:27:29,164 --> 00:27:31,189
I don't have a clear shot, sir.
The wife is blocking him.

403
00:27:31,266 --> 00:27:32,324
And he wasn't listening to me.

404
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,560
Do you know what
Zimabu Eter means?

405
00:27:33,635 --> 00:27:34,727
And they were going to kill him.

406
00:27:34,803 --> 00:27:37,636
What? Wait. I can't hear you,
Tommy. What?

407
00:27:37,705 --> 00:27:39,002
Has anybody
got the shot?

408
00:27:39,073 --> 00:27:42,565
Zimabu Eter!
Zimabu Eter!

409
00:27:42,644 --> 00:27:43,770
What the hell does that mean?

410
00:27:44,078 --> 00:27:46,103
Zimabu Eter? I don't know, Tommy.
What the hell does that mean?

411
00:27:46,181 --> 00:27:47,205
Anybody got the goddamn shot?

412
00:27:47,282 --> 00:27:49,216
But I can find out.
Just give me a little time.

413
00:27:49,284 --> 00:27:50,444
I need to know now!

414
00:27:50,518 --> 00:27:51,644
Just give me a little time.

415
00:27:51,719 --> 00:27:53,584
I will find out for you.
I promise.

416
00:27:53,655 --> 00:27:54,781
No, please!

417
00:27:54,856 --> 00:27:55,948
You can't help me.

418
00:27:57,125 --> 00:27:58,490
I love you.

419
00:27:59,994 --> 00:28:01,621
Move, move!

420
00:28:03,698 --> 00:28:05,666
Move, move, move!

421
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,768
Tommy! God damn it!

422
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:39,426
I'm having a hard time

423
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,797
understanding what
happened here.

424
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:44,099
I know. I know.

425
00:28:44,772 --> 00:28:47,240
You don't know what he saw?
So you have no idea what he saw?

426
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:48,639
He didn't tell me.

427
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:50,507
What did he tell you?

428
00:28:53,715 --> 00:28:57,651
That what he thought he saw
wasn't an owl.

429
00:28:57,719 --> 00:28:58,981
That it was something else.

430
00:28:59,754 --> 00:29:02,655
And that's what was
keeping him up at night?

431
00:29:03,291 --> 00:29:04,383
Yeah.

432
00:29:06,628 --> 00:29:09,756
So he was under hypnosis
when he saw this?

433
00:29:13,101 --> 00:29:14,193
Yeah.

434
00:29:14,602 --> 00:29:17,332
And how do you know what
he saw was real?

435
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,997
I don't know that it was.

436
00:29:20,174 --> 00:29:22,369
So what you're saying is that
Tommy might have done all of this

437
00:29:22,443 --> 00:29:24,673
based on something
that was imaginary.

438
00:29:31,719 --> 00:29:35,177
All I know is that he believed
what he saw,

439
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:38,116
and there was more fear
in his eyes

440
00:29:38,192 --> 00:29:40,387
than I've ever seen in my life.

441
00:29:40,495 --> 00:29:43,623
Had you not hypnotized him,

442
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:45,529
do you think he would
have done this?

443
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:50,297
What do you mean?

444
00:29:51,406 --> 00:29:53,203
I'm just wondering,

445
00:29:53,274 --> 00:29:54,468
without this hypnotism,

446
00:29:55,677 --> 00:29:59,044
do you think he still would
have murdered his family?

447
00:30:03,985 --> 00:30:07,477
That is a ridiculous
and offensive question.

448
00:30:07,622 --> 00:30:09,783
No, what's ridiculous
and offensive

449
00:30:09,857 --> 00:30:11,825
is that an entire family is
lying in a morgue

450
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:13,656
from a murder-suicide,

451
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:14,820
and the last
meaningful contact

452
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:17,023
that the murderer
had was with you.

453
00:30:17,098 --> 00:30:18,565
No, what happened tonight

454
00:30:18,633 --> 00:30:21,158
would have manifested itself
eventually.

455
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:24,165
He was suppressing something.

456
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:26,263
Look, in 13 years of practice,

457
00:30:26,341 --> 00:30:29,708
I've never witnessed something
to this extent.

458
00:30:30,044 --> 00:30:32,376
Abbey, why didn't you contact us

459
00:30:33,181 --> 00:30:35,081
if you suspected he was unstable

460
00:30:35,216 --> 00:30:37,150
after an admittedly violent episode?

461
00:30:37,218 --> 00:30:40,210
He was completely coherent
when he left my office.

462
00:30:40,288 --> 00:30:42,722
Now, I had no reason
to suspect..

463
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,585
I called his wife to ask her
to keep an eye on him.

464
00:30:44,659 --> 00:30:46,388
And now she's dead.

465
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,130
Okay, I'm not going
to sit here and listen

466
00:30:55,203 --> 00:30:57,797
to how hypnosis-induced
murder caused this.

467
00:30:57,872 --> 00:30:59,772
Jesus, I am trying to find out..
This is ridiculous.

468
00:30:59,841 --> 00:31:03,572
What caused one of the worst
murders in the history of Nome.

469
00:31:03,644 --> 00:31:06,374
There's something going on in this
town that we don't understand.

470
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:08,881
There's something happening
to people in their sleep..

471
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,474
Well, I don't know
about any of that!

472
00:31:10,551 --> 00:31:12,382
I don't understand
what you're talking about!

473
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:13,886
I don't deal in hallucinations.

474
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:15,752
I don't deal in the visions
in the ether.

475
00:31:15,823 --> 00:31:17,120
What in the hell are you
talking about?

476
00:31:17,191 --> 00:31:18,886
I'm dealing in real flesh
and blood things,

477
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,428
4 of whom are lying on
slabs next door.

478
00:31:21,496 --> 00:31:23,589
How dare you? My husband
was lying on one of those slabs

479
00:31:23,664 --> 00:31:24,824
and you still
haven't found his killer.

480
00:31:24,899 --> 00:31:26,730
Abbey, now, you know damn well
what happened to Will.

481
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:27,825
That case is closed.

482
00:31:27,902 --> 00:31:29,369
No, you cannot
file things away

483
00:31:29,437 --> 00:31:30,836
without getting to
what really happened.

484
00:31:30,905 --> 00:31:34,204
Now, there are more unsolved murders
and missing people in Nome..

485
00:31:34,275 --> 00:31:36,038
Sit down.
Than any other town in Alaska,

486
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:38,578
3 years of which have been
under your watch.

487
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:40,876
Now, what is happening
in this town is very real,

488
00:31:40,948 --> 00:31:41,972
and it must be acknowledged.

489
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:43,642
Sit down!

490
00:31:53,728 --> 00:31:56,356
You stop whatever this
governmental study is,

491
00:31:56,431 --> 00:31:58,331
this hypnosis, whatever it is,

492
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:00,230
whatever you and
Will were after.

493
00:32:00,301 --> 00:32:02,929
It's bringing nothing but bad news
to a town that's had enough.

494
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:04,369
Now, I don't care how
important it is to you.

495
00:32:04,439 --> 00:32:07,738
I don't care how hard you've
worked on it. I don't care.

496
00:32:07,809 --> 00:32:11,267
You're not gonna use the people
of Nome for a goddamn rat study.

497
00:32:24,292 --> 00:32:27,193
I felt responsible for..

498
00:32:28,996 --> 00:32:31,226
death, and his family's.

499
00:32:33,167 --> 00:32:35,863
And at the time,
after all that happened,

500
00:32:35,937 --> 00:32:38,838
I still didn't know why he did it.

501
00:32:42,143 --> 00:32:45,306
All of the patients reported
seeing the same owl,

502
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:50,855
but Tommy mentioned
that his memory

503
00:32:51,155 --> 00:32:53,585
of the owl was wrong

504
00:32:54,856 --> 00:32:58,223
and that he didn't
see it anymore.

505
00:32:58,292 --> 00:33:01,591
It was some sort of
false recollection.

506
00:33:06,134 --> 00:33:07,726
The question is,

507
00:33:09,704 --> 00:33:13,071
if under hypnosis,
will the others feel the same way?

508
00:33:16,944 --> 00:33:18,969
Will they see what he saw?

509
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:26,982
We have to proceed
with extreme caution.

510
00:33:28,656 --> 00:33:32,357
What happened here
remains unexplained,

511
00:33:32,856 --> 00:33:34,387
like Will.

512
00:33:52,213 --> 00:33:53,237
Abel?

513
00:33:53,314 --> 00:33:57,250
I heard what happened. I just
wanted to make sure you were okay.

514
00:33:57,318 --> 00:33:59,115
Hey. You flew all
the way up here?

515
00:33:59,187 --> 00:34:00,848
That's all right.
That's okay.

516
00:34:00,922 --> 00:34:02,412
I'm worried about you.

517
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:03,889
You didn't have to.
I'm fine.

518
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,357
Yeah?
Yeah.

519
00:34:06,227 --> 00:34:07,785
You want to talk?

520
00:34:07,862 --> 00:34:09,830
I can't. I can't cancel
my schedule.

521
00:34:10,031 --> 00:34:13,694
Theresa, good morning. Can you
transcribe this for me, please?

522
00:34:13,768 --> 00:34:15,065
Do you want me to
cancel your meetings?

523
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:17,468
No, no. Thank you.

524
00:34:17,572 --> 00:34:19,335
So, how you feeling?

525
00:34:22,276 --> 00:34:23,903
I feel like I just need to
start my day.

526
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:25,377
Yeah.

527
00:34:25,947 --> 00:34:28,313
Maybe it's..
You think it's

528
00:34:28,382 --> 00:34:30,316
time that you, maybe,
stepped back?

529
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:35,383
Maybe consider it a sabbatical?

530
00:34:35,456 --> 00:34:37,253
I love that word.

531
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,919
It doesn't actually sound like
what it means, which is "time off."

532
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:42,827
Abbey, listen, you need to step
away for perspective,

533
00:34:42,897 --> 00:34:44,797
clarity on what's happened.

534
00:34:45,733 --> 00:34:49,567
I mean, you can't
continue like this.

535
00:34:49,637 --> 00:34:51,628
No, I can, and I have to.

536
00:34:53,241 --> 00:34:56,142
It's the only thing
I have within my power.

537
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:59,338
It's all I have left,
is to continue,

538
00:34:59,413 --> 00:35:01,005
to find out what's
causing all of this.

539
00:35:02,316 --> 00:35:04,113
I can't.. I don't..

540
00:35:04,585 --> 00:35:08,646
I don't believe that it can be
just chalked up to coincidence,

541
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:11,017
what happened to Will, what
happened to Tommy and his family.

542
00:35:11,092 --> 00:35:12,855
I don't.

543
00:35:14,528 --> 00:35:16,155
Not in this town.

544
00:35:16,264 --> 00:35:18,596
Do you mind if I stay on a bit?

545
00:35:18,666 --> 00:35:20,293
Just kept an eye on you,

546
00:35:21,135 --> 00:35:24,195
since you're not too keen
on doing it yourself?

547
00:35:27,174 --> 00:35:28,198
It's all right.

548
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:41,017
So, lots to talk about.

549
00:35:41,088 --> 00:35:42,988
What happened to Tommy?

550
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:44,115
I can't discuss..

551
00:35:44,191 --> 00:35:48,560
He's dead. You should be able
to discuss everything.

552
00:35:50,197 --> 00:35:51,789
It had something..

553
00:35:51,866 --> 00:35:53,369
I believe..

554
00:35:54,156 --> 00:35:56,929
that it had something to do
with his sleeping habits.

555
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:01,867
We're really worried, obviously.

556
00:36:03,811 --> 00:36:06,803
It's the second suicide
in a couple of months.

557
00:36:07,848 --> 00:36:09,247
I understand.

558
00:36:09,317 --> 00:36:11,046
We want you to
hypnotize me, too.

559
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:16,652
We need to know if there's
anything I'm not remembering,

560
00:36:16,724 --> 00:36:18,851
and I feel..

561
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:22,089
We feel like the best thing
to do is to face it.

562
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,662
We've already thought it over.

563
00:36:30,705 --> 00:36:33,970
If you want to undergo this,

564
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:40,213
we're gonna have to go
about this very delicately.

565
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:46,946
Would it be all right if a colleague
of mine, Dr. Campos,

566
00:36:47,688 --> 00:36:50,418
came in to observe?

567
00:36:50,491 --> 00:36:51,583
Yeah, sure.

568
00:36:54,829 --> 00:36:55,796
Okay.

569
00:36:58,866 --> 00:37:01,859
5. Deeper.

570
00:37:02,056 --> 00:37:04,529
Deeper. You're totally relaxed.

571
00:37:05,005 --> 00:37:09,942
4, 3, 2 and 1.

572
00:37:10,544 --> 00:37:13,843
So, when was the last time
you had trouble sleeping?

573
00:37:14,749 --> 00:37:16,114
Last night.

574
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:23,089
And do you remember seeing
anything unusual last night?

575
00:37:24,458 --> 00:37:25,652
An owl.

576
00:37:32,133 --> 00:37:33,998
Tell me about the owl.

577
00:37:34,668 --> 00:37:36,533
Tell me about the owl.

578
00:37:38,205 --> 00:37:42,437
It's a beige owl.

579
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:46,206
Its eyes are big, like..

580
00:37:49,483 --> 00:37:53,783
I don't know.
It doesn't look like a normal owl.

581
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:56,288
It doesn't look like a normal owl.

582
00:38:01,796 --> 00:38:02,956
Scott?

583
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,690
There is no owl.
It's not..

584
00:38:08,102 --> 00:38:10,434
Honey, honey,
honey, wake up.

585
00:38:11,939 --> 00:38:15,375
You hear that?
Wake up.

586
00:38:22,716 --> 00:38:24,809
She's not..
She's not waking up.

587
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:27,145
Someone's outside the door.

588
00:38:33,828 --> 00:38:35,625
Tell me what you see.

589
00:38:37,198 --> 00:38:40,133
Something's out there.

590
00:38:40,201 --> 00:38:41,759
Can you see who it is?

591
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:45,558
Not who, what.

592
00:38:46,659 --> 00:38:48,278
I know what they are.

593
00:38:49,043 --> 00:38:52,376
They come all the time
since I was little.

594
00:38:53,881 --> 00:38:55,576
What are they?

595
00:38:58,052 --> 00:39:00,179
They're gonna open the door.

596
00:39:02,756 --> 00:39:05,589
They get in without
setting off the alarm.

597
00:39:06,327 --> 00:39:08,887
I armed it. I know..
I know I did.

598
00:39:12,366 --> 00:39:15,392
I thought they only come
when I think about them,

599
00:39:15,469 --> 00:39:18,063
but I wasn't thinking about
them tonight.

600
00:39:30,651 --> 00:39:34,212
Okay, Scott, I'm gonna count to 3,
and you're gonna wake up.

601
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:36,518
1, 2, 3!

602
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:41,352
Scott! Scott!
Scott, wake up!

603
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,622
Here you go.
Go ahead.

604
00:40:15,396 --> 00:40:16,727
I'm sorry.

605
00:40:27,441 --> 00:40:29,102
It's unbelievable.

606
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:33,370
It doesn't make any sense.

607
00:40:34,848 --> 00:40:37,078
Scott, you don't have to rush.

608
00:40:37,151 --> 00:40:40,450
Whenever you're ready,
you can tell us what you saw.

609
00:40:41,255 --> 00:40:42,620
I saw them.

610
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,624
Who's them?

611
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:50,027
They're not from here.

612
00:40:53,267 --> 00:40:54,894
What do you mean?

613
00:40:55,336 --> 00:40:58,794
I can't describe it.
I can't see what's in my own mind.

614
00:41:00,507 --> 00:41:02,304
I can't control it.

615
00:41:03,844 --> 00:41:06,278
All I can see is the owl,
but I..

616
00:41:06,747 --> 00:41:09,716
I know it's not an owl,
but I..

617
00:41:10,784 --> 00:41:14,158
I remember the smell, like a..

618
00:41:14,954 --> 00:41:17,018
Like a putrid cinnamon.

619
00:41:17,992 --> 00:41:20,426
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

620
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:25,190
The worst part

621
00:41:25,265 --> 00:41:28,894
was the voice inside my head,
like..

622
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:33,866
'Cause they
talk to you

623
00:41:33,941 --> 00:41:35,670
so you can hear them,
but..

624
00:41:36,977 --> 00:41:40,003
They also talk inside your mind,

625
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,809
like you're connected
or something.

626
00:41:43,951 --> 00:41:47,387
And they take me away to somewhere,
but I can't remember,

627
00:41:47,554 --> 00:41:48,919
and I can't remember
what they do to me.

628
00:41:48,989 --> 00:41:53,050
Okay, okay, Scott,
that's enough for today.

629
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:56,593
I'm so sorry.

630
00:41:56,664 --> 00:41:57,961
It's gonna be all right.

631
00:41:58,098 --> 00:42:01,590
Cindy, under the circumstances,

632
00:42:01,669 --> 00:42:03,398
I'm going to contact
Sheriff August

633
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:05,131
to let him know that we've met

634
00:42:05,205 --> 00:42:07,036
and let him know that
we've had this session.

635
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:08,699
Yeah, please do.

636
00:42:10,711 --> 00:42:11,803
Okay.

637
00:42:14,648 --> 00:42:17,139
Now, I know why..
did what he did.

638
00:42:19,987 --> 00:42:21,045
Why?

639
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:24,856
You'd have to have seen it,

640
00:42:24,925 --> 00:42:27,553
felt it, what it is.

641
00:42:28,896 --> 00:42:30,420
What is it?

642
00:42:30,664 --> 00:42:32,222
The worst.

643
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:33,596
Of what?

644
00:42:35,169 --> 00:42:37,967
That you could..
You could ever imagine.

645
00:42:42,976 --> 00:42:47,675
Come on.
Babe, let's go home.

646
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,946
We're going home.

647
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,396
What the hell was that?

648
00:43:07,468 --> 00:43:08,526
Abel.

649
00:43:11,872 --> 00:43:16,366
Do you believe in
abduction theories?

650
00:43:16,443 --> 00:43:18,707
What do you mean,
like kidnappings?

651
00:43:18,779 --> 00:43:22,152
Yeah.
No. No,

652
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:24,212
not..

653
00:43:25,552 --> 00:43:29,753
Not kidnappings,
but abduction, as in..

654
00:43:31,458 --> 00:43:33,358
You don't mean alien abductions,
do you?

655
00:43:33,427 --> 00:43:37,158
Well, you know, I think that
might be what we just heard.

656
00:43:37,231 --> 00:43:39,290
When you look at the statistics,
they're pretty impressive.

657
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:43,359
I mean, Will was kind of into that,
and he did a little research.

658
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:45,937
You know, there are
over 11 million people

659
00:43:46,006 --> 00:43:47,667
that have either
reported seeing

660
00:43:47,741 --> 00:43:51,802
or know someone who has seen
UFOs since the 1930s.

661
00:43:52,045 --> 00:43:55,674
The idea of any of this stuff
being real is.. You can't..

662
00:43:55,749 --> 00:43:57,546
Come on, Abel.
I mean, when something

663
00:43:57,618 --> 00:43:59,916
boasts 11 million witnesses..

664
00:43:59,987 --> 00:44:03,013
You know, that would win any
court case in the world.

665
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:04,955
Well, and there are
just as many

666
00:44:05,025 --> 00:44:06,788
explanations and reasons.

667
00:44:10,164 --> 00:44:11,554
Weather balloons,

668
00:44:11,854 --> 00:44:16,134
atmospheric effects,
optical illusions.

669
00:44:16,336 --> 00:44:19,333
In this case, perhaps,
hypnocognic hallucinations.

670
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:24,574
Listen, we have to deal with hard,
empirical evidence

671
00:44:24,645 --> 00:44:26,510
and facts.
We can't..

672
00:44:28,549 --> 00:44:31,143
Abbey! Abbey.
The tape.

673
00:44:31,552 --> 00:44:32,610
The tape you gave
me this morning..

674
00:44:32,686 --> 00:44:34,153
Wait. Slow down.
Slow down, Theresa.

675
00:44:34,221 --> 00:44:36,655
What is it?
Did you listen to it?

676
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:44,322
I don't.. I don't know
what this is.

677
00:44:44,398 --> 00:44:45,888
I don't know what's going on.

678
00:44:49,536 --> 00:44:51,231
I don't want to listen to it again.

679
00:44:54,575 --> 00:44:55,633
That was weird.

680
00:45:56,536 --> 00:45:57,696
Abbey?

681
00:46:34,775 --> 00:46:36,140
That's you?

682
00:46:38,412 --> 00:46:40,175
That's not my voice.

683
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:45,207
That's not me.

684
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:54,750
After you heard that,
what did you, like..

685
00:46:54,828 --> 00:46:56,455
How did you react?

686
00:46:56,530 --> 00:46:58,225
After the initial shock,

687
00:46:59,299 --> 00:47:02,564
I was in denial.

688
00:47:03,704 --> 00:47:06,298
It couldn't be me,
my voice.

689
00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:12,178
So, what happened next?

690
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:18,078
I went through what I could
hold onto.

691
00:47:18,385 --> 00:47:19,511
Which were what?

692
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:21,076
Which were the facts.

693
00:47:23,523 --> 00:47:26,492
I went home to try and recount

694
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,619
what happened during
the recording.

695
00:47:56,423 --> 00:47:58,755
I was sleeping in my bed

696
00:47:58,825 --> 00:47:59,849
when my door opened.

697
00:48:13,473 --> 00:48:17,273
Someone or something came
into my room.

698
00:48:24,851 --> 00:48:26,876
Did it cause that somehow?

699
00:48:28,188 --> 00:48:31,157
Some kind of allergic reaction?

700
00:48:31,224 --> 00:48:32,350
How long had it been there?

701
00:48:33,226 --> 00:48:37,094
But whatever, whoever it was,
I fought it.

702
00:48:39,433 --> 00:48:42,334
But it was too strong,
and it took me away.

703
00:48:43,937 --> 00:48:46,269
The moment it became too real

704
00:48:46,339 --> 00:48:48,864
was when I looked down
at the floorboards

705
00:48:49,676 --> 00:48:53,635
and I saw scratches leading
all the way to the door.

706
00:48:57,651 --> 00:48:59,983
I put myself
back together.

707
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:04,756
I was determined to figure out
what it was,

708
00:49:05,459 --> 00:49:07,359
what came into my room,

709
00:49:08,061 --> 00:49:11,030
what it was saying,
where it took me,

710
00:49:12,899 --> 00:49:14,764
and what it did to me.

711
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:18,596
I listened to that
tape over and over

712
00:49:20,273 --> 00:49:24,073
to figure out anything,

713
00:49:25,779 --> 00:49:28,944
something to explain

714
00:49:30,059 --> 00:49:31,464
what it was.

715
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:34,183
It wasn't Latin.

716
00:49:35,322 --> 00:49:36,914
It wasn't Greek.

717
00:49:38,291 --> 00:49:41,351
It wasn't any language
that I had heard before,

718
00:49:43,163 --> 00:49:47,964
and I felt it was the key

719
00:49:48,635 --> 00:49:51,627
to everything
that was happening

720
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:56,234
to me, to Will,

721
00:49:57,677 --> 00:49:59,702
and everyone else in Nome.

722
00:50:01,681 --> 00:50:05,811
And then I found exactly
what I was looking for.

723
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:37,045
Hello?
Hello.

724
00:50:38,385 --> 00:50:40,649
Is this Dr..

725
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,585
Awolowa Odusami.

726
00:50:42,656 --> 00:50:44,283
Yes, this is he.

727
00:50:44,357 --> 00:50:45,949
Hi, I was wondering,

728
00:50:46,026 --> 00:50:50,019
are you familiar with a person
named Dr. William Tyler?

729
00:50:50,764 --> 00:50:52,664
No, I'm not.
I'm sorry.

730
00:50:55,468 --> 00:50:56,492
Okay.

731
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:57,798
May I ask who's speaking?

732
00:51:01,441 --> 00:51:02,567
I'm..

733
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:03,836
Will you tell me your name?

734
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:35,865
Hello?
Listen,

735
00:51:36,309 --> 00:51:38,539
there was a man who
called me from this number.

736
00:51:38,612 --> 00:51:40,512
He called himself John.

737
00:51:42,115 --> 00:51:43,582
There's no John here.

738
00:51:43,650 --> 00:51:44,947
Exactly, I know.

739
00:51:47,454 --> 00:51:51,686
What was he.. Why was
he calling you?

740
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:57,322
He wanted to have a history
lesson on ancient languages.

741
00:52:02,636 --> 00:52:03,967
Look, I..

742
00:52:06,106 --> 00:52:10,133
That was my husband
that you talked to,

743
00:52:11,244 --> 00:52:14,680
and he's been murdered.

744
00:52:14,748 --> 00:52:15,806
Dr..

745
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:18,009
I'm sorry..
I'm sorry to hear that.

746
00:52:18,084 --> 00:52:19,574
He listened to me.

747
00:52:19,653 --> 00:52:20,642
Yeah.

748
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,779
He didn't judge me

749
00:52:22,856 --> 00:52:25,290
or try to analyze me.

750
00:52:25,692 --> 00:52:26,716
I just.. I need..

751
00:52:26,793 --> 00:52:28,317
He just listened.

752
00:52:28,695 --> 00:52:29,719
I need you to hear me out.

753
00:52:29,796 --> 00:52:32,390
And then he flew over
to Nome.

754
00:52:59,292 --> 00:53:00,850
I thought it was Akkadian,
but it's not.

755
00:53:00,927 --> 00:53:03,259
It's Sumerian.
I'm sure of it.

756
00:53:03,330 --> 00:53:04,797
This is widely considered
by my peers

757
00:53:04,864 --> 00:53:07,992
to be the Holy Grail of
dead languages,

758
00:53:08,535 --> 00:53:11,527
but we haven't deciphered
the entire lexicon.

759
00:53:19,979 --> 00:53:21,378
"Our creation" is
the last 2 words.

760
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:24,110
I'm not sure of the first 2.

761
00:53:28,655 --> 00:53:30,782
"Examine" is the 1st word.

762
00:53:37,931 --> 00:53:40,126
The last word is ruin or destroy.

763
00:53:42,702 --> 00:53:45,859
Our creation, examine,

764
00:53:46,252 --> 00:53:48,299
ruin, or destroy.

765
00:53:49,676 --> 00:53:51,268
Ruin, destroy who?

766
00:53:51,344 --> 00:53:52,709
It's an incomplete translation.

767
00:53:52,779 --> 00:53:55,577
We can't be sure of exactly
what's being said.

768
00:53:55,648 --> 00:53:57,206
But whatever it is,
it sounds aggressive.

769
00:53:57,283 --> 00:54:01,117
I'm sorry, but none of this
is any making sense.

770
00:54:02,555 --> 00:54:03,647
It's a
verbalized recording

771
00:54:03,723 --> 00:54:05,918
of the Sumerian
language.

772
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:08,426
Now, we're talking about the
oldest language in human history

773
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:11,328
for whatever reason
recorded in your room.

774
00:54:11,765 --> 00:54:13,756
What was happening?
What was being done to me?

775
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:16,996
What is unsettling is
that whatever it is,

776
00:54:18,671 --> 00:54:20,969
the vocals, they don't sound..

777
00:54:22,976 --> 00:54:24,603
Ordinary.
Human?

778
00:54:26,345 --> 00:54:28,236
Stop. Stop. Stop.

779
00:54:29,048 --> 00:54:32,040
Okay? Let's not fuel
any more of these fires.

780
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:36,045
Now, there's
any number of reasons

781
00:54:36,122 --> 00:54:38,955
for the distortion in the voice.

782
00:54:39,325 --> 00:54:41,816
I'm not jumping to any conclusions,

783
00:54:43,630 --> 00:54:45,188
but her voice sounded fine.

784
00:54:45,265 --> 00:54:48,530
The tape could have been
recorded over, for one,

785
00:54:48,601 --> 00:54:50,296
and part of the old tape
could still be heard.

786
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:51,598
No, I don't recycle tapes.

787
00:54:51,671 --> 00:54:53,571
Well, maybe this time you did.

788
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:54,937
And that still does not explain

789
00:54:55,008 --> 00:54:57,135
why that voice is
speaking a language

790
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:59,576
that predates
Egyptian hieroglyphics.

791
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:03,148
Now, I've studied the Sumerian
civilization for most of my career,

792
00:55:03,216 --> 00:55:07,812
and what I have
found is intriguing.

793
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:15,389
You can go into
any Sumerian exhibit

794
00:55:15,462 --> 00:55:17,794
and see what I am
about to tell you.

795
00:55:17,864 --> 00:55:21,857
Drawings of rockets that look like
Apollo launching into the sky.

796
00:55:23,036 --> 00:55:24,970
Etchings and sculptures
of men in spacesuits

797
00:55:25,038 --> 00:55:27,370
and what look
like oxygen masks.

798
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:32,367
And this artwork was created
in the 4th millennium B.C.E.,

799
00:55:32,445 --> 00:55:34,470
4,000 years before Christ
walked the Earth.

800
00:55:34,547 --> 00:55:37,107
"Genesis", Noah's ark,
to name a few.

801
00:55:37,183 --> 00:55:39,014
Both of these stories
existed in Sumer

802
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:41,076
6,000 years before
the Bible was written.

803
00:55:41,154 --> 00:55:43,850
"Genesis" came from
the Sumerian epic of creation.

804
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:46,721
Noah's ark came from
the Sumerian deluge.

805
00:55:46,893 --> 00:55:48,952
The alien-god legend
has its basis,

806
00:55:49,028 --> 00:55:51,929
its origins, in Sumerian history.

807
00:55:52,832 --> 00:55:55,767
You can find everything I've
described in a museum right now.

808
00:55:58,271 --> 00:56:02,833
You know, it is one thing to
entertain wild theories,

809
00:56:05,645 --> 00:56:08,478
but quite another
to invest in them.

810
00:56:09,415 --> 00:56:11,440
Yes, and you're entitled
to that reaction,

811
00:56:11,518 --> 00:56:13,884
but as I said from the beginning,
I draw no conclusions.

812
00:56:13,953 --> 00:56:15,318
I'm dealing in facts.

813
00:56:15,388 --> 00:56:17,379
Now, this is drawn from
thousands of years

814
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:19,891
of data research and collection.

815
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:22,357
How this is put together is
open to debate.

816
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:26,295
Do you honestly believe
you were forcibly

817
00:56:26,366 --> 00:56:28,129
removed from your bedroom

818
00:56:28,535 --> 00:56:30,662
by members of an alien race?

819
00:56:37,544 --> 00:56:39,409
Hello? Abbey, can you
come over? It's Scott.

820
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:41,379
Something's wrong.
He wants you to come over. He..

821
00:56:41,447 --> 00:56:44,473
Cindy? Hold on a second.
Just take a deep breath.

822
00:57:14,314 --> 00:57:15,474
Hi, Cindy.
Hey.

823
00:57:15,548 --> 00:57:17,778
This is Dr. Odusami.
He's here to help.

824
00:57:17,850 --> 00:57:18,874
Good morning.

825
00:57:18,952 --> 00:57:20,010
Come in.

826
00:57:24,791 --> 00:57:25,780
Scott?

827
00:57:25,858 --> 00:57:26,916
What took you
so long?

828
00:57:26,993 --> 00:57:29,427
I'm sorry.
I came as quick as I could.

829
00:57:29,495 --> 00:57:31,395
Last night was..

830
00:57:31,464 --> 00:57:32,590
Calm down.

831
00:57:32,665 --> 00:57:34,030
Calm down?
Scott.

832
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:35,226
How can I?
You don't..

833
00:57:35,301 --> 00:57:36,996
Scott, I'm here, all right?

834
00:57:37,070 --> 00:57:40,039
Now, you've gotta try and breathe
for me. You have to calm yourself,

835
00:57:40,106 --> 00:57:42,870
because I cannot help you
if you're all wound up.

836
00:57:42,942 --> 00:57:45,137
I don't want to talk about it,
but I have to.

837
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:47,941
Have to, have to, have to..

838
00:57:48,014 --> 00:57:49,345
I have to, I have to, I have to..

839
00:57:50,316 --> 00:57:51,840
Scott, why are you..

840
00:57:51,918 --> 00:57:53,180
I have to.

841
00:57:54,887 --> 00:57:57,378
What is this?
How did you get this?

842
00:57:57,457 --> 00:58:00,722
I don't know. I didn't know
it was there. I just..

843
00:58:01,894 --> 00:58:04,590
Okay. Can we set up
the camera, please?

844
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:06,797
No, no..
I don't need anyone..

845
00:58:06,866 --> 00:58:08,197
I don't want
this getting out.

846
00:58:08,267 --> 00:58:10,599
Scott, we need to record
what's happening.

847
00:58:10,670 --> 00:58:12,365
We need to record
this session for study,

848
00:58:12,438 --> 00:58:15,373
so we can find out
what's going on with you.

849
00:58:16,109 --> 00:58:18,407
Okay, I don't want to go under.

850
00:58:19,545 --> 00:58:21,137
Well, we don't have to do that.

851
00:58:21,214 --> 00:58:23,614
Just try and relay
whatever you remember.

852
00:58:24,550 --> 00:58:28,452
There's things I have
to remember, but I..

853
00:58:29,355 --> 00:58:32,552
But I can't.
I can't without..

854
00:58:33,259 --> 00:58:36,888
You know what? We can put
you under a very light hypnosis.

855
00:58:37,563 --> 00:58:38,655
Okay?

856
00:58:38,931 --> 00:58:40,523
But if you're worried..

857
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:41,828
I have to.
I have to remember.

858
00:58:41,901 --> 00:58:43,766
I have to get
this out of my head.

859
00:58:43,836 --> 00:58:46,862
It feels like it's
just dug in there

860
00:58:46,939 --> 00:58:49,100
and I can't think
straight anymore.

861
00:58:51,077 --> 00:58:52,772
It's okay.
It's okay.

862
00:58:52,845 --> 00:58:54,073
I have to..

863
00:58:55,348 --> 00:58:56,645
I'll do it.

864
00:58:56,716 --> 00:58:57,774
Are you sure?

865
00:58:57,850 --> 00:58:58,908
Yeah.

866
00:59:00,286 --> 00:59:01,378
Okay.

867
00:59:03,122 --> 00:59:04,589
Are we ready?

868
00:59:06,526 --> 00:59:07,515
Okay.

869
00:59:12,432 --> 00:59:14,024
It's okay.
Okay?

870
00:59:16,569 --> 00:59:18,264
Relax.
Just relax.

871
00:59:20,239 --> 00:59:23,436
There's a lot of people
in the room with you now.

872
00:59:23,509 --> 00:59:24,942
You're not alone.

873
00:59:26,345 --> 00:59:27,505
Relax.

874
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:32,683
By the time I reach one,
you will be asleep.

875
00:59:34,487 --> 00:59:37,012
5, 4,

876
00:59:38,357 --> 00:59:41,326
3, 2,

877
00:59:43,629 --> 00:59:44,687
1.

878
01:00:11,023 --> 01:00:12,047
Scott?

879
01:01:03,843 --> 01:01:05,538
But where are we going?

880
01:01:05,611 --> 01:01:06,805
North Carolina.

881
01:01:07,046 --> 01:01:08,277
North Carolina?

882
01:01:08,948 --> 01:01:10,176
What's in North Carolina?

883
01:01:10,249 --> 01:01:11,409
Us, by tomorrow.

884
01:01:11,484 --> 01:01:12,712
But I have a game tomorrow.

885
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:15,719
Pack your bags.

886
01:01:19,492 --> 01:01:21,460
Hello? I don't think she feels
like talking to you right now.

887
01:01:21,527 --> 01:01:23,256
Mommy?
Yeah, baby.

888
01:01:23,329 --> 01:01:24,353
What's wrong?

889
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:25,692
Nothing, sweetie.

890
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:27,858
We're just gonna go take
a little break, okay?

891
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:28,958
It's Abel.

892
01:01:29,035 --> 01:01:30,024
Tell him I'll call him back.

893
01:01:30,102 --> 01:01:31,126
She'll call you back.

894
01:01:31,204 --> 01:01:33,172
He says he has to talk to you.
I'll call you back, Abel.

895
01:01:33,239 --> 01:01:35,104
He's already on his way.

896
01:01:35,174 --> 01:01:37,108
Are we gonna see Grandma
and Grandpa?

897
01:01:37,176 --> 01:01:40,407
No, baby, Grandma and Grandpa
are gone, remember?

898
01:01:40,813 --> 01:01:42,747
Yeah, they're with Daddy.

899
01:01:42,815 --> 01:01:44,510
I mean Grandpa
and Grandma Lilly.

900
01:01:44,584 --> 01:01:46,279
No, we're not going
to see them, either.

901
01:01:46,352 --> 01:01:48,013
But why not?

902
01:01:49,922 --> 01:01:52,686
Baby, I'm just gonna sit you
down right here,

903
01:01:52,758 --> 01:01:55,192
and you've gotta let Mommy pack,
okay? Thank you.

904
01:01:55,261 --> 01:01:57,229
It's 'cause of Dad?

905
01:01:59,732 --> 01:02:03,259
Ronnie, I really need you
to help me right now, okay?

906
01:02:03,603 --> 01:02:05,571
Please take your
sister into her room

907
01:02:05,638 --> 01:02:07,731
and help her get ready, okay?

908
01:02:07,907 --> 01:02:09,238
Thank you.

909
01:02:12,612 --> 01:02:13,670
Mom?

910
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:15,870
Yeah?

911
01:02:15,948 --> 01:02:17,108
What did you do?

912
01:02:20,019 --> 01:02:21,247
Hold on!

913
01:02:26,292 --> 01:02:27,554
What happened to Scott?

914
01:02:27,627 --> 01:02:28,616
August, I'm sorry.

915
01:02:28,694 --> 01:02:30,457
He's paralyzed
from the neck down.

916
01:02:30,529 --> 01:02:34,226
3 of the vertebrate in his neck
are completely severed!

917
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:37,469
I don't know.

918
01:02:37,536 --> 01:02:38,560
You were there.

919
01:02:38,638 --> 01:02:39,730
I can't explain it.
I can't..

920
01:02:39,805 --> 01:02:40,829
Tell me what happened.

921
01:02:40,907 --> 01:02:42,534
How'd he break his back?

922
01:02:42,608 --> 01:02:45,600
I put him under,
and there was something..

923
01:02:45,678 --> 01:02:48,306
something was inside of him

924
01:02:48,381 --> 01:02:51,350
that twisted his body,
and that..

925
01:02:51,417 --> 01:02:53,146
Something was inside of him,

926
01:02:53,219 --> 01:02:54,709
and it twisted his body?

927
01:02:54,887 --> 01:02:56,752
And you have proof of this?

928
01:02:56,822 --> 01:02:59,416
It didn't record.
It was all distorted.

929
01:02:59,492 --> 01:03:00,720
Abbey..

930
01:03:02,495 --> 01:03:05,862
How in God's name am I
supposed to believe this?

931
01:03:05,965 --> 01:03:06,989
I know what I saw.

932
01:03:07,066 --> 01:03:08,363
Yeah, what you saw?

933
01:03:08,434 --> 01:03:09,696
I know what I saw.
What you saw?

934
01:03:09,769 --> 01:03:11,703
Abbey, what you're doing is
hurting people,

935
01:03:11,771 --> 01:03:13,466
very obviously!

936
01:03:13,539 --> 01:03:15,404
Now, my heart goes out to you,
it really does,

937
01:03:15,474 --> 01:03:16,839
what you've been through.
I understand that,

938
01:03:16,909 --> 01:03:18,968
but you leave me
no choice.

939
01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:20,342
You have the right
to remain silent.

940
01:03:20,413 --> 01:03:21,437
What?

941
01:03:21,514 --> 01:03:22,913
Anything you say
or do can and will

942
01:03:22,982 --> 01:03:24,574
be held against you
in a court of law.

943
01:03:24,650 --> 01:03:26,413
No, stop. Stop.

944
01:03:26,585 --> 01:03:27,711
You have the right to an attorney.

945
01:03:27,787 --> 01:03:28,811
August.

946
01:03:28,888 --> 01:03:31,948
August, please, don't do this.

947
01:03:32,024 --> 01:03:33,855
Ryan!
Sheriff, no.

948
01:03:34,026 --> 01:03:36,824
Ryan, you can't.
Please. You can't..

949
01:03:37,363 --> 01:03:40,799
You can't take me away from my
children. August, please, don't.

950
01:03:40,866 --> 01:03:43,801
August. August, I know what
this looks like.

951
01:03:44,937 --> 01:03:47,929
I know what this looks like,
but I was there.

952
01:03:48,374 --> 01:03:49,500
I saw it.

953
01:03:49,575 --> 01:03:51,270
You were there,
and you saw what?

954
01:03:51,677 --> 01:03:52,803
What did you see?

955
01:03:52,912 --> 01:03:55,210
Well, it's the kind
of thing that..

956
01:03:56,849 --> 01:03:57,838
Well, you'd have
to have seen it.

957
01:03:57,917 --> 01:03:59,475
No. Bullshit.

958
01:03:59,552 --> 01:04:01,918
Now, this woman is not
capable of committing

959
01:04:01,988 --> 01:04:03,080
any physical harm
to any man.

960
01:04:03,155 --> 01:04:04,713
I don't know what
she is capable of..

961
01:04:04,790 --> 01:04:07,554
She's not capable.
You know. You know. Hey!

962
01:04:07,626 --> 01:04:10,288
Just calm down for a second
and hear me out.

963
01:04:10,363 --> 01:04:14,060
I know that what's happening
here in Nome is frightening.

964
01:04:14,133 --> 01:04:15,225
I know it is.

965
01:04:15,634 --> 01:04:17,864
But whatever you do,
you cannot arrest her

966
01:04:17,937 --> 01:04:18,995
for something you
don't understand

967
01:04:19,071 --> 01:04:21,062
just because you're terrified.
Come on.

968
01:04:21,140 --> 01:04:23,108
You're pushing it.
You're pushing it.

969
01:04:23,175 --> 01:04:25,336
I mean, I was there.
I saw it.

970
01:04:25,411 --> 01:04:26,969
Now you're gonna take her
away from her children

971
01:04:27,046 --> 01:04:28,536
for something
that she did not do.

972
01:04:28,614 --> 01:04:30,639
Come on.

973
01:04:30,716 --> 01:04:31,876
Let's just calm down.

974
01:04:31,951 --> 01:04:33,475
Please. Please.

975
01:04:35,888 --> 01:04:37,879
You will be under
24-hour supervision,

976
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:40,448
and you will not
leave these premises.

977
01:04:40,926 --> 01:04:44,828
If you touch that doorknob,
I will arrest you!

978
01:04:45,765 --> 01:04:47,995
I understand. Thank you.

979
01:04:49,602 --> 01:04:51,467
You're coming with me.

980
01:04:54,974 --> 01:04:56,305
Thank you.

981
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:04,845
Hey, look after your mom.
It's okay, sweetheart.

982
01:05:13,793 --> 01:05:14,987
Ronnie.

983
01:05:39,919 --> 01:05:42,649
This is Ryan, sir. I'm stationed in
front of the Tyler home.

984
01:05:42,721 --> 01:05:43,745
Over.

985
01:05:43,823 --> 01:05:45,188
<i>Roger that.</i>

986
01:05:55,768 --> 01:06:00,637
But they said they were
questioned by Chief..

987
01:06:01,407 --> 01:06:04,308
reminded him about
the disappearances..

988
01:06:04,944 --> 01:06:05,968
What about them?

989
01:06:06,045 --> 01:06:08,513
Homicides, missing people.

990
01:06:09,715 --> 01:06:11,774
Dozens of them.

991
01:06:11,851 --> 01:06:14,615
It's been happening
there since the 1960s,

992
01:06:15,354 --> 01:06:18,619
and the FBI have been dropping in
from time to time.

993
01:06:18,724 --> 01:06:19,782
Would you say..

994
01:06:19,859 --> 01:06:20,848
What did they find?

995
01:06:20,926 --> 01:06:24,885
Nothing. It's inconclusive.

996
01:06:25,798 --> 01:06:28,790
To this day,
nothing has been solved.

997
01:06:29,735 --> 01:06:30,724
What do you think it means?

998
01:06:30,803 --> 01:06:33,499
How do you put it in perspective?

999
01:06:34,773 --> 01:06:38,265
They have different categories

1000
01:06:38,344 --> 01:06:40,471
for these types of things.

1001
01:06:40,980 --> 01:06:42,607
Different levels.

1002
01:06:44,116 --> 01:06:46,414
An encounter of the 1st kind,

1003
01:06:47,086 --> 01:06:49,111
that's when you see a UFO.

1004
01:06:50,556 --> 01:06:54,652
The 2nd kind is when you see
evidence of it:

1005
01:06:55,928 --> 01:06:58,522
crop circles, radiation.

1006
01:06:59,832 --> 01:07:03,529
The 3rd kind is when you
make contact.

1007
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:06,033
But the 4th kind,

1008
01:07:08,407 --> 01:07:11,570
there's nothing more frightening
than the 4th.

1009
01:07:13,012 --> 01:07:14,219
You see,

1010
01:07:15,212 --> 01:07:19,019
that one is
when they abduct you.

1011
01:07:21,754 --> 01:07:24,689
And I think it's all
part of the same thing.

1012
01:07:25,024 --> 01:07:27,083
It's all connected,

1013
01:07:29,028 --> 01:07:31,462
to Will, the missing people,

1014
01:07:32,865 --> 01:07:34,628
to everything in Nome.

1015
01:07:34,867 --> 01:07:38,394
If this type of thing
was happening to Nome,

1016
01:07:40,072 --> 01:07:42,734
to me, I think

1017
01:07:45,344 --> 01:07:47,642
it's happening
to other people.

1018
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:52,883
Not just there,
but all over the world,

1019
01:07:54,086 --> 01:07:55,917
in towns, cities.

1020
01:07:57,690 --> 01:08:00,022
Most of them
don't even know it.

1021
01:08:00,125 --> 01:08:01,592
Know they're abducted?

1022
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:03,059
How could they know?

1023
01:08:04,630 --> 01:08:08,361
How could they remember what
they're being forced to forget?

1024
01:08:29,755 --> 01:08:31,245
What the hell?

1025
01:09:32,885 --> 01:09:34,079
Holy shit.

1026
01:09:54,540 --> 01:09:55,529
Where are they?

1027
01:09:55,607 --> 01:09:56,596
I don't know.

1028
01:09:56,675 --> 01:09:58,233
I tried to tell you..
You don't know?

1029
01:09:58,310 --> 01:09:59,675
I want the video played back.

1030
01:09:59,745 --> 01:10:01,679
Sir, it didn't record.

1031
01:10:01,747 --> 01:10:02,839
It did, but nothing
came out.

1032
01:10:02,915 --> 01:10:04,746
Come on! Bullshit!

1033
01:10:04,850 --> 01:10:07,284
Ryan, pull yourself
together, man.

1034
01:10:16,362 --> 01:10:18,296
Calm down. Mom.
What the hell happened?

1035
01:10:18,364 --> 01:10:20,525
They took my baby.
They took her.

1036
01:10:20,599 --> 01:10:21,896
Who?

1037
01:10:21,967 --> 01:10:23,366
They took my baby.
What is she talking about?

1038
01:10:23,435 --> 01:10:24,663
Someone kidnapped
Ashley.

1039
01:10:24,737 --> 01:10:26,466
Okay, I want this entire house
searched.

1040
01:10:26,538 --> 01:10:28,062
I want everybody
inside, outside

1041
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:30,165
going through these
premises top to bottom.

1042
01:10:30,242 --> 01:10:31,368
Ronnie, what'd you see?

1043
01:10:31,443 --> 01:10:33,206
Nothing. I came in here
and she was gone.

1044
01:10:33,278 --> 01:10:35,007
What's going on here?
August, listen to me.

1045
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:36,138
I'm listening.

1046
01:10:36,215 --> 01:10:37,876
A beam of light came down,

1047
01:10:38,050 --> 01:10:40,348
and they took her into the sky.

1048
01:10:40,419 --> 01:10:43,786
They took my little girl up
into the sky. I saw it!

1049
01:10:43,856 --> 01:10:44,845
Through the ceiling?

1050
01:10:44,923 --> 01:10:45,981
August, I saw it!

1051
01:10:46,058 --> 01:10:47,082
Through the ceiling?

1052
01:10:47,159 --> 01:10:48,922
Yes. They took her
through the ceiling.

1053
01:10:48,994 --> 01:10:50,120
What is this craziness?

1054
01:10:50,195 --> 01:10:51,219
What the hell
is going on here?

1055
01:10:51,296 --> 01:10:52,422
I couldn't stop it.

1056
01:10:52,498 --> 01:10:53,863
Okay. Everybody clear this room!

1057
01:10:53,932 --> 01:10:54,956
I want everybody out of here

1058
01:10:55,033 --> 01:10:57,297
except Ronnie and Abbey!

1059
01:10:57,403 --> 01:10:59,132
Ronnie, sit down right there,
please. Okay?

1060
01:10:59,204 --> 01:11:01,001
Abbey, you sit down.
Please sit down. My baby.

1061
01:11:01,073 --> 01:11:03,439
Okay? Sit here.
I want to talk to you, okay?

1062
01:11:03,509 --> 01:11:04,567
You just tell me.

1063
01:11:04,643 --> 01:11:06,338
Listen, less than 5 hours
after I arrest you,

1064
01:11:06,412 --> 01:11:08,141
your daughter goes missing.

1065
01:11:08,213 --> 01:11:09,202
I told you.

1066
01:11:09,281 --> 01:11:10,270
Yeah, but that's horseshit.

1067
01:11:10,349 --> 01:11:11,543
We know that that's not real.

1068
01:11:11,617 --> 01:11:12,675
Tell me what happened.

1069
01:11:12,751 --> 01:11:14,013
You had an officer
outside my house.

1070
01:11:14,086 --> 01:11:15,110
Yes, we had
an officer outside.

1071
01:11:15,187 --> 01:11:16,518
What did he see?
He didn't see anything.

1072
01:11:16,588 --> 01:11:18,488
He says that the videotape
wasn't playing. Now, just tell me.

1073
01:11:18,557 --> 01:11:19,581
Where is she?
Listen, Abbey!

1074
01:11:19,658 --> 01:11:20,647
What did he see?

1075
01:11:20,726 --> 01:11:22,193
Get him in here right now!
You listen to me now.

1076
01:11:22,261 --> 01:11:23,626
You know what's real!
I want to know what he saw.

1077
01:11:23,695 --> 01:11:25,492
You know what's real! You had
an officer outside my house!

1078
01:11:25,564 --> 01:11:26,588
God damn it!
Where is she?

1079
01:11:26,665 --> 01:11:28,292
You were supposed to protect us!

1080
01:11:28,367 --> 01:11:32,167
Abbey, where is she, God damn it?
You tell me where she is!

1081
01:11:33,038 --> 01:11:35,370
Where is Ashley?
Where is she?

1082
01:11:35,441 --> 01:11:37,341
Mom!
Can't you stop?

1083
01:11:37,709 --> 01:11:38,698
It's okay.

1084
01:11:38,777 --> 01:11:40,267
Please, just stop!

1085
01:11:40,345 --> 01:11:44,247
Abbey, you haven't been right in
the head since Will.

1086
01:11:44,950 --> 01:11:46,349
You just haven't been
right in the head.

1087
01:11:46,418 --> 01:11:47,942
You haven't found his killer.

1088
01:11:48,020 --> 01:11:49,214
What?

1089
01:11:49,688 --> 01:11:51,178
You still haven't found his killer.

1090
01:11:51,256 --> 01:11:53,451
No, Abbey, we have.
Yes, we have.

1091
01:11:53,525 --> 01:11:55,686
He's still out there.
He's still out there.

1092
01:11:55,761 --> 01:11:58,821
No. Listen, I'm removing him
from your custody.

1093
01:11:58,931 --> 01:12:00,125
No.
Yes, I am,

1094
01:12:00,199 --> 01:12:02,497
and find a lawyer,
because you've run out

1095
01:12:02,568 --> 01:12:03,557
of all the goodwill
I've got, okay?

1096
01:12:03,635 --> 01:12:04,795
He's not gonna take you away.

1097
01:12:04,870 --> 01:12:07,304
Guys, get in here. We're removing
Ronnie from Abbey's custody!

1098
01:12:07,372 --> 01:12:09,033
No. No, you're not!
You will not..

1099
01:12:09,107 --> 01:12:10,938
Let go!
You will not.

1100
01:12:11,009 --> 01:12:12,567
No. No. Let go!

1101
01:12:12,644 --> 01:12:14,134
No. No, no.
Baby, baby, no!

1102
01:12:14,213 --> 01:12:15,237
Let go. Let go.

1103
01:12:15,314 --> 01:12:17,748
No, no.
You're not taking my boy!

1104
01:12:17,816 --> 01:12:19,215
I'm sorry.
You're not taking my boy!

1105
01:12:19,284 --> 01:12:21,081
He'll be safe!

1106
01:12:21,153 --> 01:12:23,018
You're not taking my boy!

1107
01:12:43,475 --> 01:12:44,567
God!

1108
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:50,045
My babies!

1109
01:12:56,355 --> 01:12:58,255
Why are you doing this?

1110
01:13:00,592 --> 01:13:04,426
All I realized, that they weren't
going to be able to find her.

1111
01:13:04,863 --> 01:13:06,797
That I would have
to do it on my own.

1112
01:13:06,865 --> 01:13:08,765
But you couldn't leave.

1113
01:13:09,768 --> 01:13:14,296
No, that's not what I mean.
I had to..

1114
01:13:17,376 --> 01:13:20,971
To find a way
to go directly to them,

1115
01:13:21,847 --> 01:13:24,247
directly to the source.

1116
01:14:41,193 --> 01:14:43,286
I know what I saw, but I..

1117
01:14:46,765 --> 01:14:48,858
I can't accept it.
I can't.

1118
01:14:52,270 --> 01:14:55,171
So please don't ask me to,
because I can't.

1119
01:14:57,809 --> 01:15:00,243
I still have to do this.

1120
01:15:00,312 --> 01:15:01,802
But Scott, you..

1121
01:15:09,421 --> 01:15:10,786
Is this the right way?

1122
01:15:10,856 --> 01:15:12,050
I don't know.

1123
01:15:13,759 --> 01:15:15,624
I don't have a choice.

1124
01:15:19,498 --> 01:15:22,524
Yeah.
I know you don't.

1125
01:15:29,808 --> 01:15:32,038
Your eyes are feeling heavier.

1126
01:15:33,979 --> 01:15:36,539
7, 6,

1127
01:15:38,750 --> 01:15:41,913
5, 4,

1128
01:15:43,955 --> 01:15:46,890
3, 2

1129
01:15:48,026 --> 01:15:50,517
and 1.

1130
01:15:51,596 --> 01:15:52,995
Abbey?
Yes.

1131
01:15:53,765 --> 01:15:58,202
Let's go back 3 days,
to Tuesday,

1132
01:15:59,671 --> 01:16:02,731
when you were giving dictation
in your bedroom.

1133
01:16:03,241 --> 01:16:04,606
Yes.
Good.

1134
01:16:05,210 --> 01:16:08,577
Now, what happened after
you finished your dictation?

1135
01:16:10,415 --> 01:16:12,355
Remains unexplained,

1136
01:16:12,855 --> 01:16:16,385
and worse, unsolved,

1137
01:16:17,289 --> 01:16:18,620
like Will.

1138
01:16:21,426 --> 01:16:22,450
Are you sleeping?

1139
01:16:22,527 --> 01:16:23,551
Yes.

1140
01:16:25,897 --> 01:16:27,626
What happened
next?

1141
01:16:32,471 --> 01:16:33,460
There's an owl.

1142
01:16:33,538 --> 01:16:34,800
The owl.

1143
01:16:35,941 --> 01:16:37,841
It's looking down at me.
It's looking down at me.

1144
01:16:37,909 --> 01:16:40,503
Is it the same owl
your patients see?

1145
01:16:41,313 --> 01:16:42,644
Yes.
Yes.

1146
01:16:43,448 --> 01:16:45,882
It's smiling.
It's smiling.

1147
01:16:48,053 --> 01:16:51,050
I don't like it when it smiles.

1148
01:16:51,189 --> 01:16:53,623
What do you mean, smiling?

1149
01:16:53,759 --> 01:16:55,953
I don't know what I mean.

1150
01:16:56,027 --> 01:16:58,427
I don't want to know.
I don't want to know.

1151
01:16:58,497 --> 01:17:01,933
Well, it's too late to forget
what you already know.

1152
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,365
Tell me what you see.

1153
01:17:07,372 --> 01:17:09,306
It's not an owl.
It's not an owl.

1154
01:17:44,476 --> 01:17:47,138
God, help me! Help me!

1155
01:17:50,248 --> 01:17:51,476
No.

1156
01:17:51,550 --> 01:17:53,177
No! No!

1157
01:17:53,485 --> 01:17:55,680
Help me! Help me!

1158
01:18:00,458 --> 01:18:02,619
Help me! Help!

1159
01:18:03,995 --> 01:18:06,259
Abbey, what is it?

1160
01:18:06,865 --> 01:18:08,332
God, help me.

1161
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:13,562
There are too many of them.
It burns. It hurts!

1162
01:18:19,811 --> 01:18:23,645
No, no! Please!
Stop it. No.

1163
01:18:31,056 --> 01:18:33,354
It's sticking into my shoulder.

1164
01:20:53,965 --> 01:20:56,195
So what happened in that room?

1165
01:20:56,968 --> 01:20:58,299
They came,

1166
01:20:59,738 --> 01:21:02,605
and we were..

1167
01:21:05,777 --> 01:21:07,108
We were..

1168
01:21:09,948 --> 01:21:11,575
They abducted us.

1169
01:21:12,350 --> 01:21:16,343
All of us, but brought us
back that same night.

1170
01:21:19,290 --> 01:21:21,815
We don't remember
where they took us

1171
01:21:23,828 --> 01:21:25,728
or what they did to us.

1172
01:21:26,264 --> 01:21:29,257
Even with hypnosis, it's..

1173
01:21:29,864 --> 01:21:31,497
black.

1174
01:21:36,007 --> 01:21:37,872
Your voice, or its voice,

1175
01:21:39,010 --> 01:21:40,602
said it was God.

1176
01:21:42,347 --> 01:21:44,281
What do you believe?

1177
01:21:44,349 --> 01:21:45,748
I believe..

1178
01:21:46,217 --> 01:21:49,516
It's hard, but I believe

1179
01:21:50,088 --> 01:21:52,682
the things I've seen,

1180
01:21:53,558 --> 01:21:56,186
the presence I've felt

1181
01:21:57,128 --> 01:21:58,527
inside of me

1182
01:21:59,497 --> 01:22:03,991
is beyond anything
you can imagine.

1183
01:22:05,136 --> 01:22:06,398
It was

1184
01:22:09,607 --> 01:22:11,097
hopelessness,

1185
01:22:11,876 --> 01:22:15,312
so it cannot be God,

1186
01:22:16,281 --> 01:22:17,748
but it can..

1187
01:22:19,150 --> 01:22:20,981
It can pretend to be.

1188
01:22:23,121 --> 01:22:25,146
And what about Ashley?

1189
01:22:25,223 --> 01:22:26,690
What about..

1190
01:22:26,758 --> 01:22:27,850
And what about
your daughter?

1191
01:22:29,494 --> 01:22:30,654
She..

1192
01:22:32,630 --> 01:22:35,030
I had to recover
from that night.

1193
01:22:36,534 --> 01:22:39,230
It took me a couple
of days to wake up.

1194
01:23:20,912 --> 01:23:22,777
Abel..

1195
01:23:22,847 --> 01:23:24,178
It's..

1196
01:23:25,483 --> 01:23:27,280
It's okay.
It's okay.

1197
01:23:27,352 --> 01:23:28,341
What is this?

1198
01:23:28,419 --> 01:23:30,080
Look, I have
to apologize.

1199
01:23:30,922 --> 01:23:31,911
I..

1200
01:23:33,725 --> 01:23:36,626
I'm sorry, I really hate to
have to do this

1201
01:23:37,428 --> 01:23:40,420
when you're in this condition
that you're in.

1202
01:23:44,802 --> 01:23:45,791
It's okay.

1203
01:23:45,870 --> 01:23:46,894
So,

1204
01:23:47,372 --> 01:23:50,205
well, I still have that question
for you, Abbey.

1205
01:23:57,348 --> 01:23:58,975
How did Will die?

1206
01:24:04,489 --> 01:24:06,218
He was murdered.

1207
01:24:06,291 --> 01:24:08,259
No, Abbey.

1208
01:24:11,663 --> 01:24:15,394
Abbey, he's going to show you
something that will upset you,

1209
01:24:16,201 --> 01:24:19,830
but it has to be done.

1210
01:24:21,005 --> 01:24:22,370
Understand?

1211
01:24:30,048 --> 01:24:32,039
This is the head of a man

1212
01:24:36,221 --> 01:24:37,882
who used this gun.

1213
01:24:42,427 --> 01:24:43,519
Okay?

1214
01:24:48,066 --> 01:24:52,366
Yeah. It was suicide,
Abbey. It was suicide.

1215
01:24:52,937 --> 01:24:56,270
He took a pistol,
shot himself in the head.

1216
01:24:56,507 --> 01:24:58,372
There was no intruder.

1217
01:24:59,010 --> 01:25:03,242
There was no knife. Just him with
his pistol at the side of your bed.

1218
01:25:04,682 --> 01:25:08,083
He's not that man.
He wouldn't do that.

1219
01:25:08,152 --> 01:25:11,952
He wouldn't do that to us.
He wouldn't do that to his family.

1220
01:25:16,427 --> 01:25:18,657
Tell him he's wrong.
Tell him.

1221
01:25:19,697 --> 01:25:21,550
I'm a psychologist,

1222
01:25:21,857 --> 01:25:25,430
and I would have known..
Christ.

1223
01:25:26,471 --> 01:25:29,065
I would have known
if he was gonna..

1224
01:25:29,407 --> 01:25:31,568
Abbey, Abbey.

1225
01:25:31,643 --> 01:25:32,905
You can't blame yourself

1226
01:25:32,977 --> 01:25:35,810
for something that was
going on in his head.

1227
01:25:37,282 --> 01:25:42,015
Who knows what he'd learned,
what he didn't share,

1228
01:25:43,655 --> 01:25:45,418
and finally what broke him?

1229
01:25:45,490 --> 01:25:47,549
Now you know the reality.

1230
01:25:49,460 --> 01:25:53,226
I'm gonna ask you for
the last time. Tell me.

1231
01:25:56,868 --> 01:25:58,836
What happened to Ashley?

1232
01:25:59,304 --> 01:26:02,068
Tell me. Abbey.

1233
01:26:06,044 --> 01:26:10,276
You know what happened.
You experienced it.

1234
01:26:12,016 --> 01:26:15,713
But we came back
and she didn't. Abel.

1235
01:26:18,222 --> 01:26:22,352
Tell him what happened.

1236
01:26:33,738 --> 01:26:36,002
Something took my daughter.

1237
01:26:37,975 --> 01:26:42,275
I don't know what.
I don't.. I don't know how.

1238
01:26:46,751 --> 01:26:50,118
I don't know what it was,
but you have to believe me.

1239
01:26:52,156 --> 01:26:54,454
You have to believe me, please.

1240
01:26:56,194 --> 01:26:57,388
Please.

1241
01:26:59,430 --> 01:27:00,556
Please.

1242
01:27:00,631 --> 01:27:02,189
It's difficult to go back.

1243
01:27:04,469 --> 01:27:05,697
Go back?

1244
01:27:07,238 --> 01:27:11,197
Back over the line from
fiction to reality.

1245
01:27:16,013 --> 01:27:19,210
You can't just stop being insane
whenever you want to.

1246
01:27:22,286 --> 01:27:25,778
It's the kind of thing that stays
with you forever.

1247
01:27:30,027 --> 01:27:32,052
So Will committed suicide?

1248
01:27:34,832 --> 01:27:35,890
Yes.

1249
01:27:37,735 --> 01:27:40,704
Your credibility. How do you
expect me or the audience

1250
01:27:40,772 --> 01:27:42,296
to believe anything
you're saying,

1251
01:27:42,373 --> 01:27:44,307
if you actually hallucinated

1252
01:27:44,375 --> 01:27:45,899
the murder of your husband?

1253
01:27:47,211 --> 01:27:49,338
They weren't hallucinations.

1254
01:27:51,215 --> 01:27:52,876
I just couldn't..

1255
01:27:54,585 --> 01:27:57,213
It can be difficult
to face the truth,

1256
01:27:58,689 --> 01:28:00,179
and with Will,

1257
01:28:01,692 --> 01:28:03,922
that's how I dealt with it.

1258
01:28:03,995 --> 01:28:05,792
And no matter what you believe,

1259
01:28:06,931 --> 01:28:10,389
the recordings do not lie.

1260
01:28:11,002 --> 01:28:13,359
We were talking about things that

1261
01:28:13,752 --> 01:28:17,099
that.. aren't normal.

1262
01:28:18,176 --> 01:28:19,559
Is dead..

1263
01:28:21,076 --> 01:28:23,209
back is broken.

1264
01:28:23,915 --> 01:28:27,816
And Ashley,
she's still gone.

1265
01:28:29,153 --> 01:28:32,122
These are hard facts.

1266
01:28:32,490 --> 01:28:34,287
They do appear to be.

1267
01:28:34,592 --> 01:28:37,390
No, God damn it,
they are!

1268
01:28:38,529 --> 01:28:42,021
You can sit here
and speculate,

1269
01:28:42,700 --> 01:28:46,261
but I have to
keep hope alive.

1270
01:28:48,239 --> 01:28:51,970
I have to believe
in what we're doing,

1271
01:28:53,010 --> 01:28:55,103
my story,

1272
01:28:57,248 --> 01:28:58,909
that it will help.

1273
01:29:00,418 --> 01:29:02,045
I have to believe

1274
01:29:02,854 --> 01:29:07,223
that she's still
alive somewhere,

1275
01:29:08,559 --> 01:29:10,026
that she's safe.

1276
01:29:11,429 --> 01:29:15,331
I have to believe
that there's a chance

1277
01:29:16,734 --> 01:29:18,929
that I'm gonna
see her again,

1278
01:29:21,038 --> 01:29:22,903
hold her again,

1279
01:29:24,775 --> 01:29:26,299
hear her voice.

1280
01:29:29,580 --> 01:29:33,710
I just want
my little girl back.

1281
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:38,147
She's all I have.

1282
01:29:43,494 --> 01:29:44,984
Let's stop there.

1283
01:29:50,668 --> 01:29:51,999
Dr. Tyler,

1284
01:29:54,672 --> 01:29:56,663
we're done for the night.

1285
01:30:03,147 --> 01:30:05,274
Someone else is interested
in Nome, as well.

1286
01:30:05,349 --> 01:30:06,646
Since the 1960s,
there have been

1287
01:30:06,717 --> 01:30:09,709
over 2,000 visits
to Nome by the FBI,

1288
01:30:09,787 --> 01:30:10,776
the highest in Alaska.

1289
01:30:10,855 --> 01:30:12,186
Second is Anchorage,

1290
01:30:12,256 --> 01:30:15,521
with a population
76 times larger than Nome.

1291
01:30:15,593 --> 01:30:18,323
The FBI have paid them
353 visits.

1292
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:21,451
In the end, what you believe
is yours to decide.

1293
01:30:21,656 --> 01:30:25,051
In the end, what you believe
is yours to decide.

1294
01:32:21,452 --> 01:32:22,976
UFO Reporting Center.

1295
01:32:23,054 --> 01:32:24,715
Yeah, I got a doozy for you.

1296
01:32:27,058 --> 01:32:28,150
Okay.

1297
01:32:28,325 --> 01:32:31,419
Gonna put me into the hospital,
I tell you that.

1298
01:32:32,396 --> 01:32:33,454
What happened?

1299
01:32:33,531 --> 01:32:34,828
I'm a truck driver.

1300
01:32:35,099 --> 01:32:38,159
I had a load to Salt Lake City
from Banning.

1301
01:32:38,836 --> 01:32:42,932
I pulled over, didn't.. I got out
of the truck, kind of stretched.

1302
01:32:43,007 --> 01:32:44,998
I looked up at the stars,

1303
01:32:45,076 --> 01:32:46,202
and I saw these 2..

1304
01:32:46,277 --> 01:32:49,303
There were quite a few of them
that were kind of low,

1305
01:32:49,380 --> 01:32:51,814
and they were, like, flickering.

1306
01:32:51,882 --> 01:32:52,940
You know, what could
they be?

1307
01:32:53,017 --> 01:32:55,850
And then it occurred to me,
maybe I'm seeing a UFO.

1308
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:58,286
Portland Air Traffic Control
Tower in Portland, Maine.

1309
01:32:58,355 --> 01:32:59,481
Yes, sir.

1310
01:32:59,557 --> 01:33:01,320
I guess I have a UFO report.

1311
01:33:01,392 --> 01:33:05,795
What they drew, and these 4 people
pretty much agree that,

1312
01:33:05,863 --> 01:33:09,560
actually, what they drew,
it looked like a fedora hat..

1313
01:33:09,633 --> 01:33:12,932
I saw something spectacular
in the sky last night

1314
01:33:13,003 --> 01:33:14,937
that I have no
explanation for.

1315
01:33:15,005 --> 01:33:17,940
In fact, I'm sure as many as
50 to 100 people saw it

1316
01:33:18,008 --> 01:33:19,839
in different areas
last night.

1317
01:33:19,910 --> 01:33:24,574
I'm sure it had as many as
20 pulsating red lights,

1318
01:33:25,149 --> 01:33:26,616
one white light in the front of it.

1319
01:33:26,684 --> 01:33:29,050
Like I said, it was about
100 feet from me.

1320
01:33:30,020 --> 01:33:33,285
To me, it looked about,
like, something..

1321
01:33:34,125 --> 01:33:38,494
Like I said, right.. I remember
seeing it, but after that it just..

1322
01:33:40,097 --> 01:33:42,156
I don't exactly remember too much.

1323
01:33:42,233 --> 01:33:45,168
I could see this
very bright red light,

1324
01:33:45,469 --> 01:33:47,801
and it would change
to kind of a blue light,

1325
01:33:47,872 --> 01:33:49,772
and the reflection
off the clouds.

1326
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:50,864
Yes?

1327
01:33:50,941 --> 01:33:53,671
And I could also hear this
very loud buzzing noise.

1328
01:33:53,744 --> 01:33:55,439
My daughter is 7 years old,

1329
01:33:55,513 --> 01:33:58,505
and she said it was in
the shape of a square.

1330
01:33:59,416 --> 01:34:02,476
She said she's seen
4 red lights in the corner

1331
01:34:02,553 --> 01:34:03,679
and a white one in the middle.

1332
01:34:03,754 --> 01:34:06,951
Okay. We had an aircraft
at 35,000 feet westbound.

1333
01:34:08,292 --> 01:34:11,125
They reported sighting 4 objects.

1334
01:34:11,195 --> 01:34:12,526
3 of them were at his altitude

1335
01:34:12,596 --> 01:34:14,223
and one of them was a lot lower.

1336
01:34:14,298 --> 01:34:17,199
We observed an unknown
phenomenon this morning,

1337
01:34:17,268 --> 01:34:19,828
about 1600 Zulu,

1338
01:34:19,937 --> 01:34:22,929
and we observed it
for about 10 to 15 minutes.

1339
01:34:23,340 --> 01:34:25,274
The targets were
approximately 200 miles

1340
01:34:25,342 --> 01:34:27,640
west of San Francisco
over the water.

1341
01:34:27,711 --> 01:34:30,043
They flew in what
appeared to be unison,

1342
01:34:30,114 --> 01:34:32,446
approximately 90 miles apart.

1343
01:34:32,516 --> 01:34:35,713
Their speed was in excess of
2,000 knots.

1344
01:34:36,453 --> 01:34:39,786
They did a high-speed run
for about 75 miles,

1345
01:34:40,391 --> 01:34:42,450
made a very abrupt slowdown,

1346
01:34:42,526 --> 01:34:44,391
and then a 180-degree turn,

1347
01:34:44,461 --> 01:34:45,928
and tracked back northbound

1348
01:34:45,996 --> 01:34:47,122
in excess of 2,000 knots.

1349
01:34:47,198 --> 01:34:49,223
It had fire-engine red lights,

1350
01:34:49,300 --> 01:34:51,894
kelly green lights, orange lights.

1351
01:34:51,969 --> 01:34:55,496
It would shut all them lights down
and turn a bright white.

1352
01:34:55,573 --> 01:34:57,632
It was zigzagging in and out.

1353
01:34:57,708 --> 01:35:01,075
It was shooting from one side
of the sky to the other side.

1354
01:35:01,145 --> 01:35:02,669
It was almost as if it was rolling.

1355
01:35:02,746 --> 01:35:05,840
After 8 to 12 seconds
of this boiling,

1356
01:35:06,083 --> 01:35:08,108
we saw an object
come up out of the water

1357
01:35:08,185 --> 01:35:10,380
and go straight up into the air.

1358
01:35:10,454 --> 01:35:14,720
It was a circular-shaped object.

1359
01:35:14,792 --> 01:35:15,781
To give you a brief on it,

1360
01:35:15,860 --> 01:35:18,590
I was dispatched
on a UFO sighting.

1361
01:35:18,796 --> 01:35:23,563
When I arrived, what I saw
was a real large craft

1362
01:35:23,634 --> 01:35:25,568
in the air, circular.

1363
01:35:25,736 --> 01:35:28,569
I would say it was
at least 25 yards wide,

1364
01:35:28,639 --> 01:35:30,732
or in diameter actually,
it would be,

1365
01:35:31,442 --> 01:35:34,411
and it was hovering over a house,
and it was motionless.

1366
01:35:34,478 --> 01:35:36,639
They're real bright, like a star,

1367
01:35:36,714 --> 01:35:39,774
and when it gets closer to you,
it gets dimmer.

1368
01:35:39,917 --> 01:35:43,182
Then when it lands, it goes into
a big, big orange,

1369
01:35:43,587 --> 01:35:46,078
kind of like looking at the sun
or something.

1370
01:35:47,358 --> 01:35:49,758
And then when
the light goes out,

1371
01:35:49,827 --> 01:35:51,886
it's like you turned
down a kerosene lamp.

1372
01:35:51,962 --> 01:35:52,951
What exactly happened was,

1373
01:35:53,030 --> 01:35:54,895
it was myself and a friend
were flying.

1374
01:35:54,965 --> 01:35:56,830
I'm a commercial pilot.
Yes.

1375
01:35:56,901 --> 01:36:01,463
And we saw this object,
and it wasn't bright like a light.

1376
01:36:02,106 --> 01:36:05,940
It was shining like
polished aluminum,

1377
01:36:06,010 --> 01:36:07,773
or polished metal.
Yes.

1378
01:36:07,845 --> 01:36:10,678
Like a point source
that was emanating

1379
01:36:10,748 --> 01:36:13,546
several shafts of black light.

1380
01:36:14,818 --> 01:36:16,752
It was like negative light.

1381
01:36:16,820 --> 01:36:18,811
There's gotta be several
hundred people that saw it.

1382
01:36:18,889 --> 01:36:21,653
We had an aircraft
that sighted a UFO.

1383
01:36:22,493 --> 01:36:25,621
The pilot reported an object passed

1384
01:36:26,230 --> 01:36:29,893
approximately 1/8 of a mile
in front of the aircraft.

1385
01:36:29,967 --> 01:36:32,902
It was described
as being box-shaped.

1386
01:36:33,370 --> 01:36:37,136
And as soon as I pulled over,
this object came straight at us,

1387
01:36:37,207 --> 01:36:40,665
straight to our vehicle.
It was huge. This thing was huge.

1388
01:36:40,744 --> 01:36:43,235
It was black, huge.
It had these triangle lights on it.

1389
01:36:43,314 --> 01:36:45,782
I have never been a believer
of UFOs in my entire life,

1390
01:36:45,849 --> 01:36:48,317
and I just seen a minimum
of 9 this morning

1391
01:36:48,385 --> 01:36:49,852
with my own eyes,

1392
01:36:50,287 --> 01:36:52,414
and, I mean, I am a believer.

1393
01:36:52,489 --> 01:36:57,654
One orange, and at least 9 of
the bright, bright moving lights.

1394
01:36:57,828 --> 01:37:00,126
I was just staring at it, stopped

1395
01:37:00,197 --> 01:37:02,427
in my vehicle,
and it started to move,

1396
01:37:02,666 --> 01:37:06,158
and it had lights down
each side of it, like a triangle.

1397
01:37:06,236 --> 01:37:08,170
Yes?
And then, next thing I know,

1398
01:37:08,238 --> 01:37:11,036
I didn't take my eyes off
the damn thing. It was gone.

1399
01:37:11,108 --> 01:37:14,737
My little brother, he's 3,
he'll be 4 next month,

1400
01:37:14,812 --> 01:37:16,712
last night he started
talking to my parents,

1401
01:37:16,780 --> 01:37:18,611
and I just got done
talking with him.

1402
01:37:18,682 --> 01:37:20,775
He told my dad,
"You have to lock the door,"

1403
01:37:20,851 --> 01:37:22,751
"'cause the creatures
are gonna come get me,"

1404
01:37:22,820 --> 01:37:25,015
and he said,
"The men in the stars,"

1405
01:37:25,089 --> 01:37:26,886
he said,
"they're coming to get me."

1406
01:37:26,957 --> 01:37:28,356
They follow him.
When he goes outside,

1407
01:37:28,425 --> 01:37:30,086
he says,
"The star follows me."

1408
01:37:30,160 --> 01:37:31,252
"The star follows me."

1409
01:37:31,328 --> 01:37:32,955
You'd have to experience this

1410
01:37:33,030 --> 01:37:34,691
in order to believe me.

1411
01:37:37,835 --> 01:37:40,702
I'm afraid to walk outside.
I need help.

1412
01:37:40,771 --> 01:37:44,172
I don't know how to deal with this.
It's so strange.

1413
01:37:44,942 --> 01:37:47,172
I'm frightened to go to sleep.

1414
01:37:49,580 --> 01:37:51,480
What if they come back?

1415
01:37:51,500 --> 01:37:58,500
