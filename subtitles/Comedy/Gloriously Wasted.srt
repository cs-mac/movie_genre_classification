WASTED ON THE YOUNG -1- (2010)

2
00:03:03,322 --> 00:03:06,081
- Hey, Zack, awesome race.
- Thanks.

3
00:03:06,082 --> 00:03:09,561
I guess you're looking good
for the nationals, eh? Congratulations.

4
00:03:09,562 --> 00:03:12,521
Thanks. You coming to the party tonight?

5
00:03:12,522 --> 00:03:14,482
Oh, yeah, yeah. As if I'd miss that!

6
00:03:14,483 --> 00:03:17,161
We'll find a nice quiet corner
and you can blow me, then.

7
00:03:18,883 --> 00:03:21,282
You know what, man? Fuck you, eh!

8
00:03:21,283 --> 00:03:23,762
Oh!

9
00:03:23,763 --> 00:03:26,042
Sorry, I didn't hear. What was that?

10
00:03:26,043 --> 00:03:27,883
- Got you, sweetheart.
- Excuse me?

11
00:03:27,884 --> 00:03:30,562
Hey, Dazza. Good race, man.

12
00:03:30,563 --> 00:03:32,882
Yeah, I suppose seventh is
an improvement.

13
00:03:32,883 --> 00:03:35,842
You going to step things up for
the trials when they come round?

14
00:03:35,843 --> 00:03:37,922
I'm not really in it
for the competition.

15
00:03:37,923 --> 00:03:41,922
It's the shower time he likes.
Watch your arse around this one!

16
00:03:41,923 --> 00:03:44,483
- Don't worry about him.
- Do I look worried?

17
00:03:44,484 --> 00:03:46,923
You're two unit physics, aren't you?

18
00:03:46,924 --> 00:03:49,673
- OK, that question makes me nervous.
- No, let's walk.

19
00:03:52,354 --> 00:03:53,833
I can give you my notes.

20
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:56,153
Why don't you just look over
my course journal?

21
00:03:56,154 --> 00:03:57,713
Look over? You mean complete.

22
00:03:57,714 --> 00:03:59,713
Why not? You're good at that stuff.

23
00:03:59,714 --> 00:04:02,353
- That's a whole term's worth of work.
- I just need a pass.

24
00:04:02,354 --> 00:04:04,713
- Study?
- Look, look, listen, listen.

25
00:04:04,714 --> 00:04:07,912
I'm actually making you an offer.
You understand me, right?

26
00:04:12,595 --> 00:04:14,914
I'm not going to be responsible
if you fail.

27
00:04:14,915 --> 00:04:16,874
I'll probably fail it anyway.

28
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:20,026
- Fine. Give me your notes.
- Man, you fucking rock the planet.

29
00:04:27,275 --> 00:04:28,834
You coming to the house?

30
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:30,754
Shit, man, I've got work to do.

31
00:04:30,755 --> 00:04:33,355
Don't be such a fucking martyr.
Enjoy yourself for once.

32
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:36,795
Well, that probably sucked for you, man.

33
00:04:36,796 --> 00:04:39,355
- He giveth, he taketh away.
- Yeah, I reckon.

34
00:04:39,356 --> 00:04:41,555
- Do you know what can be fun.
- What?

35
00:04:41,556 --> 00:04:45,315
The sense of freedom - it's like
you can finally connect with people

36
00:04:45,316 --> 00:04:48,115
because they let go of their barriers
and just be themselves.

37
00:04:48,116 --> 00:04:51,155
But sometimes people can be
really scary when they're like that.

38
00:04:51,156 --> 00:04:53,715
Yeah, I guess it depends.

39
00:04:53,716 --> 00:04:56,836
- I'll see how I go, OK?
- OK.

40
00:04:56,837 --> 00:04:58,396
Hey, he's coming.

41
00:04:58,397 --> 00:05:00,516
- Hey.
- Hey.

42
00:05:00,517 --> 00:05:02,156
I'll see you tonight?

43
00:05:02,157 --> 00:05:04,036
Uh, maybe.

44
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:06,916
An improvement on last time.

natural disaster, you know.
That kind of thing.

- No.

She can come.

108
00:10:09,569 --> 00:10:11,688
She asked if your brother
was going to be there.

109
00:10:11,689 --> 00:10:13,368
Really?

110
00:10:13,369 --> 00:10:14,928
Yeah.

111
00:10:14,929 --> 00:10:18,489
Now that does upset me.
That would be a messed up couple.

112

Yep.

113

'Cause he's not my brother.

116
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:35,529
Really? What's with your name?

117
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:41,730
Uh... My mum married his dad
so I'm stuck with it.

118

At first I thought it was 'cause of
the whole swimming-team cool factor.

125
00:10:57,811 --> 00:11:00,530
Then I realised
you don't speak to them either.

126
00:11:00,531 --> 00:11:02,930
Uh, I actually swim because I like it.

127

I should give you the tour.

164
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:52,737
- Hey, have you seen your brother?
- No. No.

165
00:13:52,738 --> 00:13:55,177
You really like him, don't you?

166
00:13:55,178 --> 00:13:57,658
A girl doesn't tell.

167
00:13:57,659 --> 00:13:59,898
That's great. He's a good kid.

168
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:01,738
Aren't you kind of the same age?

169
00:14:01,739 --> 00:14:03,218
Hey, listen, listen.

170
00:14:03,219 --> 00:14:05,698
If you want me to sort you out too,
let me know.

171
00:14:05,699 --> 00:14:08,088
Maybe later. We're going upstairs.
Thanks.

172
00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:17,418
You want to have some fun?

173
00:14:17,419 --> 00:14:19,296
Aren't we having fun?

174
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,697
Oh God, not K. I'm smashed!

175
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,418
Whoops!

176
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:44,580
- Zack, have you seen Xandrie around?
- Who?

177
00:14:44,581 --> 00:14:48,820
She's in our history class.
Used to go out with Brad. Big smile.

178
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:52,020
I don't know, man. Maybe try out back.

179
00:14:52,021 --> 00:14:53,579
Hey, Daz!

180
00:15:02,781 --> 00:15:04,780
Has your brother fucked her yet?

181
00:15:04,781 --> 00:15:06,420
Would I want her if he had?

182
00:15:06,421 --> 00:15:08,140
You know, I think I'm maturing.

183
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:10,421
I've got this new thing for older women.

184
00:15:10,422 --> 00:15:12,581
That explains the smile
on your mother's face.

185
00:15:12,582 --> 00:15:15,062
That explains the smile on your
mother's... Fuck off!

186
00:15:15,063 --> 00:15:17,060
Seriously, have you seen
Zack's step-mum?

187
00:15:17,061 --> 00:15:18,742
That bitch is off the hook. I'd go her.

188
00:15:18,743 --> 00:15:21,341
Watch your fucking mouth.
That's my dad's lady friend.

189
00:15:21,342 --> 00:15:23,021
Excellent.

190
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:25,058
Take it. I'm gone. Thanks!

191
00:15:31,982 --> 00:15:36,022
Hello! We got you these.
You seemed lonely, ladies.

192
00:15:36,023 --> 00:15:37,582
Oh, thanks.

193
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,742
- Hi, I'm Ella.
- Oh, biology. Right.

194
00:15:40,743 --> 00:15:42,662
Where do you live?

195
00:15:42,663 --> 00:15:46,382
So, man, are you taking anything?

196
00:15:46,383 --> 00:15:48,339
Nuh. It's too risky.

197
00:15:49,863 --> 00:15:52,302
My old man used them when he turned pro.

198
00:15:52,303 --> 00:15:54,942
It's ancient herbal shit.
They don't test for it anymore.

199
00:15:54,943 --> 00:15:57,343
- I'm still going to kick your arse.
- Yeah, whatever.

200
00:15:57,344 --> 00:16:00,623
I just need a state place to keep out
of the army. Got this deal with my dad.

201
00:16:00,624 --> 00:16:03,303
Brooky, my dad is
going to cut me off at the knees

202
00:16:03,304 --> 00:16:05,703
if I don't get an 85-plus on my TER.

203
00:16:05,704 --> 00:16:07,823
He started caring
when he married a new son.

204
00:16:07,824 --> 00:16:10,463
Now he knows what a fucking student's
meant to look like.

205
00:16:10,464 --> 00:16:12,703
- Fathers, huh?
- Yeah.

206
00:16:12,704 --> 00:16:14,783
My God. It's boring out here.

207
00:16:14,784 --> 00:16:17,224
You guys should come inside
and dance or something.

208
00:16:17,225 --> 00:16:20,263
- I'm waiting for someone.
- Oh, no. Not Darren?

209
00:16:20,264 --> 00:16:23,384
- Stay away, girlfriend. He's bad news.
- Excuse me?

210
00:16:23,385 --> 00:16:26,464
Aim higher. You're cute enough.

211
00:16:26,465 --> 00:16:28,544
Feel free to be abrasive.
I don't mind at all.

212
00:16:28,545 --> 00:16:30,984
Whatever. Let's go. Come on.

213
00:16:30,985 --> 00:16:32,904
Uh...

214
00:16:32,905 --> 00:16:35,464
- Come on, let's have some fun for once.
- Yeah.

215
00:16:35,465 --> 00:16:37,296
OK.

216
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:42,344
They sure as hell don't
test for this shit. I'm fired up.

217
00:16:42,345 --> 00:16:44,654
- Let's get laid.
- Oh, you dog, you.

218
00:16:51,946 --> 00:16:54,185
Hey, Daz.

219
00:16:54,186 --> 00:16:58,185
This is that girl right there.
She just gave me a private show.

220
00:16:58,186 --> 00:17:00,425
Are you gonna hook up with Xandrie
tonight?

221
00:17:00,426 --> 00:17:04,305
- Only if you film it.
- It's just that you're a bit late.

222
00:17:14,907 --> 00:17:17,546
- I just want to speak to...
- I think not.

223
00:17:17,547 --> 00:17:21,386
Unless you're gonna suck me
better than one of these chicks,

224
00:17:21,387 --> 00:17:23,457
you can just suck me.

225
00:17:47,188 --> 00:17:49,907
Hey, turd boy!

226
00:17:49,908 --> 00:17:52,581
Get out. Get out.

227
00:19:20,752 --> 00:19:22,310
There you go.

228
00:19:25,272 --> 00:19:29,031
I'm out, guys.
Awesome party, man. See you later.

229
00:19:29,032 --> 00:19:31,068
- See ya.
- Yeah.

230
00:19:34,112 --> 00:19:36,791
End of an era.

231
00:19:36,792 --> 00:19:39,512
The last year of our career,
then we're done.

232
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:42,592
We're old, old men, out of school.

233
00:19:42,593 --> 00:19:45,824
Getting old's for cunts.
Real men stay young.

234
00:19:47,073 --> 00:19:50,192
Well, life is about to end, anyway.

235
00:19:50,193 --> 00:19:52,472
What?

236
00:19:52,473 --> 00:19:57,069
We're dead already!
This is the afterlife, so party!

237
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:03,067
- It's a Buddhist thing.
- You're fucked, man.

238
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:12,029
You're all talk, bro.

239
00:21:11,156 --> 00:21:14,432
Xan? Xan, come on, I'll take you home.

240
00:21:32,277 --> 00:21:34,108
So you're right to drive?

241
00:21:49,998 --> 00:21:51,954
♪ Techno music thumps

242
00:23:37,242 --> 00:23:40,361
Relax, man. You're probably
getting all worked up over nothing.

243
00:23:40,362 --> 00:23:42,281
Yeah, so where is she?

244
00:23:42,282 --> 00:23:44,763
I don't know, dude.
Just sounds like a good party to me.

245
00:23:44,764 --> 00:23:46,642
Yeah. It fucking rocked!

246
00:23:46,643 --> 00:23:49,642
- Were you two even going out?
- Shay, that's not the point.

247
00:23:49,643 --> 00:23:51,802
- Dude, tell your dad.
- Which one?

248
00:23:51,803 --> 00:23:54,002
Biological
or that thing that fucks my mother?

249
00:23:54,003 --> 00:23:56,443
In that case, Darren,
I guess you're on your own.

250
00:23:56,444 --> 00:23:58,642
Thanks, Shay. I usually am.

251
00:24:02,323 --> 00:24:04,322
'In the Oresteia,
the royal line survives

252
00:24:04,323 --> 00:24:06,562
through combined human
and divine justice

253
00:24:06,563 --> 00:24:08,963
but only because the gods relent.

254
00:24:08,964 --> 00:24:11,403
The message repeated
throughout the trilogy

255
00:24:11,404 --> 00:24:13,123
that the doer suffers and learns.

256
00:24:13,124 --> 00:24:16,083
Justice, and the gods' own
closed and immortal world

257
00:24:16,084 --> 00:24:18,523
is largely the same
as that of mortal men.

258
00:24:18,524 --> 00:24:20,884
Anything is punished
that threatens the stability...'

259
00:24:22,404 --> 00:24:24,395
Come on, man!

260
00:24:25,444 --> 00:24:29,073
Hi. No, it's me. Darren.

261
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,318
Sure.

262
00:24:38,725 --> 00:24:41,204
Hey.

263
00:24:41,205 --> 00:24:43,604
Hey. Where is she?

264
00:24:43,605 --> 00:24:45,684
I thought you'd know.

265
00:24:45,685 --> 00:24:48,084
Oh, I should have just stayed with her.

266
00:24:48,085 --> 00:24:49,764
Why?

267
00:24:49,765 --> 00:24:51,323
Ella, what happened?

268
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:58,445
- Alright?
- Yeah, thanks.

269
00:24:58,446 --> 00:25:00,125
Awesome party.

270
00:25:00,126 --> 00:25:02,765
Do I know you?

271
00:25:02,766 --> 00:25:04,604
Sorry, Zack. Let's just bail. Let's go.

272
00:25:04,605 --> 00:25:06,886
I'm just kidding, man.
I'm just messing with you.

273
00:25:06,887 --> 00:25:08,765
OK.

274
00:25:10,686 --> 00:25:12,605
Sort him out, will you?

275
00:25:12,606 --> 00:25:14,722
Here comes your in-law.

276
00:25:20,086 --> 00:25:21,806
What's up?

277
00:25:21,807 --> 00:25:24,886
I just, uh... spoke to Ella.

278
00:25:24,887 --> 00:25:26,606
- Who?
- Dyke.

279
00:25:26,607 --> 00:25:28,606
Xandrie's friend.

280
00:25:28,607 --> 00:25:32,566
Um, OK. Why, what did she say to you?

281
00:25:32,567 --> 00:25:35,646
- What happened to Xandrie?
- Why, what have you heard?

282
00:25:35,647 --> 00:25:38,046
I'm asking you.

283
00:25:38,047 --> 00:25:42,686
- OK, let's talk at home, alright?
- Did you sleep with her?

284
00:25:42,687 --> 00:25:45,885
Did I sleep with her? Um...

285
00:25:46,928 --> 00:25:49,681
Daz, she fucked most of us.

286
00:25:50,728 --> 00:25:52,764
OK?

287
00:25:53,928 --> 00:25:57,247
It happens. Alright?

288
00:25:57,248 --> 00:26:01,087
Hey, how's my physics coming along,
by the way?

289
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:03,079
I'll get around to it.

290
00:26:04,128 --> 00:26:06,084
Good man.

291
00:26:28,609 --> 00:26:30,648
Nice walking with you.

292
00:26:30,649 --> 00:26:33,004
Yeah, I enjoy our little chats.

293
00:26:34,049 --> 00:26:35,810
I'll come watch you poolside, or...

294
00:26:35,811 --> 00:26:38,040
Yeah, that'd be cool.

295
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:42,519
Wait. Uh...

296
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:48,369
You probably don't
want to be seen with me.

297
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:51,329
- What do you mean?
- Well, you know how things work.

298
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:53,809
It'd be unpopular.

299
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:56,329
Everybody knows what happens
to flowers in adversity.

300
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:57,969
Not around here.

301
00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:01,043
Bad is never good until worse happens.

302
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:07,523
You're turning me down.
How sensible of you.

303
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:11,485
Hey, you're home.

304
00:28:15,534 --> 00:28:17,453
I'm not doing your physics.

305
00:28:17,454 --> 00:28:19,973
Why not?

306
00:28:19,974 --> 00:28:21,733
I'm busy.

307
00:28:21,734 --> 00:28:23,293
Your mum's busy.

308
00:28:23,294 --> 00:28:25,250
Not funny.

309
00:29:09,296 --> 00:29:11,571
Whoo!

310
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:20,854
Yeah!

311
00:29:35,217 --> 00:29:38,016
Hey, Jon, can we talk?

312
00:29:38,017 --> 00:29:40,296
What's going on?

313
00:29:40,297 --> 00:29:43,136
Tell me what happened at the party.

314
00:29:43,137 --> 00:29:44,696
Watch yourself, Daz.

315
00:29:44,697 --> 00:29:46,896
- Did something happen?
- I didn't say that.

316
00:29:46,897 --> 00:29:48,496
Well, just tell me, please?

317
00:29:48,497 --> 00:29:52,173
I don't know, man. She was wasted.
I didn't even see her.

318
00:29:56,058 --> 00:29:58,094
Now you're just fucking dead.

319
00:29:59,138 --> 00:30:00,890
You're an idiot.

320
00:30:14,898 --> 00:30:17,578
Wait, wait, wait!

321
00:30:17,579 --> 00:30:20,698
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

322
00:30:20,699 --> 00:30:22,178
Fuck you, man!

323
00:30:22,179 --> 00:30:24,534
Where's Xandrie?

324
00:30:30,939 --> 00:30:33,055
I can't tell you, man.

325
00:30:34,099 --> 00:30:36,408
You know I can't.

326
00:30:37,899 --> 00:30:39,458
Fuck.

327
00:30:39,459 --> 00:30:41,459
Sorry, Daz.

328
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:44,372
They'll kill me, man.
You know they'll kill me.

329
00:31:13,941 --> 00:31:16,940
You're confusing me, Darren.

330
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:18,940
About your homework?

331
00:31:18,941 --> 00:31:21,780
Tell me what you're doing.

332
00:31:21,781 --> 00:31:24,700
What you think you're doing.

333
00:31:24,701 --> 00:31:26,692
You did something you shouldn't have?

334
00:31:27,741 --> 00:31:29,698
Nothing happened.

335
00:31:30,742 --> 00:31:32,653
Nothing happened.

336
00:31:33,702 --> 00:31:35,181
OK, OK.

337
00:31:35,182 --> 00:31:37,138
OK, if you say so.

338
00:31:38,382 --> 00:31:40,373
Now you're getting it.

339
00:32:47,305 --> 00:32:49,744
Cassi know you drive it like that?

340
00:32:49,745 --> 00:32:54,296
Christ. Would that mean
I'm hiding something from my parents?

341
00:34:07,228 --> 00:34:09,025
Hey, Daz!

342
00:34:16,268 --> 00:34:18,736
Hey. Hey!

343
00:34:19,788 --> 00:34:22,781
- It's really good to see you.
- Yeah, you too.

344
00:34:29,309 --> 00:34:31,345
See you guys later.

345
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:49,229
- Hey, babes.
- Hi.

346
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:51,669
So you're back.

347
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:53,749
With a vengeance.

348
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:57,389
- That's great, babe.
- Courageous. Hi, um...

349
00:34:57,390 --> 00:35:00,587
Ella. We've met, actually.

350
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:07,509
So, what's up?

351
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:10,590
Just wanted to check in, babe.
See how you're going.

352
00:35:16,311 --> 00:35:18,910
Mm, I'm fine.

353
00:35:18,911 --> 00:35:20,430
Really?

354
00:35:20,431 --> 00:35:23,470
I heard you got really trashed

355
00:35:23,471 --> 00:35:26,830
and, like, hooked up with Zack and Brook
and then got arrested or whatever.

356
00:35:26,831 --> 00:35:29,110
Probably confused. My dad picked me up.

357
00:35:29,111 --> 00:35:30,544
Oh.

358
00:35:32,351 --> 00:35:34,308
You should know all this.

359
00:35:37,472 --> 00:35:39,303
It's your word against ours.

360
00:35:40,352 --> 00:35:42,388
Ooh, words.

361
00:35:56,432 --> 00:35:58,024
Oh, my God.

362
00:36:24,354 --> 00:36:26,310
I want to call home.

363
00:36:27,354 --> 00:36:29,822
I don't know.

364
00:36:31,954 --> 00:36:34,422
I don't know!

365
00:36:40,194 --> 00:36:42,788
Please, can you come and pick me up?

366
00:36:45,154 --> 00:36:47,953
Just come and pick me up!

367
00:37:30,116 --> 00:37:34,515
You know she dragged me to that
stupid party so she could see you.

368
00:37:34,516 --> 00:37:37,036
- You blame me for what happened?
- Hi, Ella Mathews.

369
00:37:37,037 --> 00:37:39,036
I don't need to blame you.

370
00:37:39,037 --> 00:37:42,268
Can I have some quiet, please?

371
00:37:43,317 --> 00:37:45,236
Didn't you beat up Jonathan?

372
00:37:45,237 --> 00:37:48,196
- A little.
- Why?

373
00:37:48,197 --> 00:37:50,236
I don't know. He deserved it.

374
00:37:50,237 --> 00:37:53,396
Like you got Brook off my back
when he was stalking me with those pics?

375
00:37:53,397 --> 00:37:54,996
Yeah, something like that.

376
00:37:54,997 --> 00:37:59,116
Darren, being nice for other people
is not the same as being nice to them.

377
00:37:59,117 --> 00:38:01,552
- Sometimes you just need to...
- Why are you here?

378
00:38:02,598 --> 00:38:04,637
I'm worried.

379
00:38:04,638 --> 00:38:06,708
Don't be.

380
00:38:08,718 --> 00:38:13,075
You selfish prick.
I'm talking about her.

381
00:38:39,799 --> 00:38:41,478
Chicks like that get upset

382
00:38:41,479 --> 00:38:43,399
when they do things
they're not proud of.

383
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,198
She's not even the problem, OK?

384
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:48,038
What do you mean, the cops?
Dude, how old are you?

385
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:49,558
I mean the rest of the school.

386
00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:52,639
She's gonna get them excited,
they start the usual jibber-jabber.

387
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,799
If my parents hear anything
about some girl...

388
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,919
Just relax, OK?

389
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,039
Look...

390
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,639
..people don't even
make their own decisions anyway.

391
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,759
They just go with whatever sounds right.

392
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,593
Keep it cool.

393
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,919
- What?
- I should just throw another party.

394
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,959
Fuck, no! Why would you do that?

395
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,200
- Because people are easy.
- We're so on it.

396
00:39:16,201 --> 00:39:18,320
Yeah, it'll be fun.

397
00:39:18,321 --> 00:39:19,959
Done.

398
00:39:24,121 --> 00:39:26,200
Brooky, you're not talking.

399
00:39:26,201 --> 00:39:28,561
Doesn't matter if I get the state title,
does it?

400
00:39:28,562 --> 00:39:31,880
If I cop a charge,
I'm not going anywhere.

401
00:39:31,881 --> 00:39:33,553
A charge for what? Nothing happened.

402
00:40:02,562 --> 00:40:04,042
You're fucking dead!

403
00:40:04,043 --> 00:40:06,682
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Take it easy, take it easy.

404
00:40:06,683 --> 00:40:09,802
He hasn't done anything. Have you, Daz?

405
00:40:09,803 --> 00:40:11,482
He says nothing in response.

406
00:40:11,483 --> 00:40:13,282
What the fuck is wrong with you?

407
00:40:13,283 --> 00:40:16,122
He's got his head in our shit
and you're gonna let him walk away?

408
00:40:16,123 --> 00:40:17,883
He's my brother. Just leave him alone.

409
00:40:17,884 --> 00:40:19,442
- Don't do that.
- Do what?

410
00:40:19,443 --> 00:40:20,922
Just don't.

411
00:40:20,923 --> 00:40:24,802
- I don't like it.
- You don't fucking have to.

412
00:40:24,803 --> 00:40:26,602
OK?

413
00:40:26,603 --> 00:40:28,643
Is everything alright?

414
00:40:28,644 --> 00:40:31,163
I don't know, man.

415
00:40:31,164 --> 00:40:33,203
Yeah. Yeah, I guess.

416
00:40:33,204 --> 00:40:36,003
- What was he looking for?
- Beats me.

417
00:40:36,004 --> 00:40:38,677
Come on, let's eat.

418
00:41:15,015 --> 00:41:18,206
I'm out, guys.
Awesome party, man. See ya later.

419
00:41:19,806 --> 00:41:20,946
Boys.

420
00:41:21,046 --> 00:41:23,445
End of an era.

421
00:41:23,446 --> 00:41:26,765
The last year of our career,
then we're done!

422
00:41:29,126 --> 00:41:32,605
Getting old's for cunts.
Real men stay young.

423
00:41:37,246 --> 00:41:39,565
You're all talk, bro.

424
00:41:39,566 --> 00:41:41,326
What are you doing, bro?

425
00:41:41,327 --> 00:41:43,687
Teaching you a lesson.
Oh, bullshit.

426
00:41:43,688 --> 00:41:46,566
- Hey, watch the master.
- Bullshit you're going first.

427
00:41:46,567 --> 00:41:49,606
Fine. Go on. Hurry up, then.

428
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:51,484
I will.

429
00:41:53,527 --> 00:41:56,325
Jono, check it out. Jono!

430
00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:19,330
So shouldn't she be at a clinic?

431
00:43:19,331 --> 00:43:21,770
Yeah, she was,
but her dad pulled her out.

432
00:43:21,771 --> 00:43:24,130
- No way. That sucks.
- Is Zack gonna sue?

433
00:43:24,131 --> 00:43:25,690
He should totally sue.

434
00:43:25,691 --> 00:43:27,890
Just because she feels bad
for being a trash bag

435
00:43:27,891 --> 00:43:29,890
doesn't mean
she has to make others suffer.

436
00:43:29,891 --> 00:43:32,770
- I think Zack should be scared.
- Should he?

437
00:43:32,771 --> 00:43:36,446
- No. No, I guess not.
- There she goes.

438
00:43:39,011 --> 00:43:41,923
Look at all the bruises on her legs.
Trash bag.

439
00:43:58,572 --> 00:44:00,528
I've got your phone.

440
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:04,331
It's OK. I don't need it.

441
00:44:04,332 --> 00:44:06,131
It's no problem.

442
00:44:06,132 --> 00:44:08,488
Really, I don't know who I'd call.

443
00:44:09,533 --> 00:44:13,092
I usually carry it on me
but I forgot today.

444
00:44:13,093 --> 00:44:15,732
- Why?
- Why what?

445
00:44:15,733 --> 00:44:18,532
Why do you carry it?

446
00:44:18,533 --> 00:44:20,683
So I can give it back to you.

447
00:44:30,653 --> 00:44:33,043
Thanks for the thought.

448
00:44:39,054 --> 00:44:40,733
I'm not friends with them.

449
00:44:40,734 --> 00:44:42,573
It's OK.

450
00:44:42,574 --> 00:44:45,293
I mean, I go along with them
because of Zack and everything,

451
00:44:45,294 --> 00:44:48,573
but I'm not... not part of it, honestly.

452
00:44:48,574 --> 00:44:51,693
I know I should have been there.

453
00:44:51,694 --> 00:44:54,083
Oh, my God! Don't tell me that.

454
00:44:56,254 --> 00:45:00,094
I have something from that night...

455
00:45:00,095 --> 00:45:02,774
We don't have to talk about it.

456
00:45:02,775 --> 00:45:05,369
- I can help.
- How can you help?

457
00:45:06,855 --> 00:45:10,294
We'll go to the school.
We'll go to your dad.

458
00:45:10,295 --> 00:45:15,774
Darren, everyone's already
made up their mind about what happened.

459
00:45:15,775 --> 00:45:17,925
I still don't know.

460
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:21,535
I blacked out.

461
00:45:21,536 --> 00:45:24,004
I woke up and I went home.

462
00:45:26,616 --> 00:45:27,969
I just...

463
00:45:29,016 --> 00:45:31,166
I just feel it.

464
00:45:33,656 --> 00:45:35,895
I feel them and what they did.

465
00:45:35,896 --> 00:45:37,614
It's part of me.

466
00:45:38,696 --> 00:45:40,971
It's part of this school.

467
00:45:43,656 --> 00:45:45,772
It's part of you.

468
00:45:50,977 --> 00:45:52,968
How can you help me with that?

469
00:45:55,257 --> 00:45:57,216
I'm sorry.

470
00:45:57,217 --> 00:45:59,287
Don't you dare.

471
00:46:01,337 --> 00:46:03,692
Now you walk away.

472
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:06,176
It's Darren, right?

473
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:10,579
Hey.

474
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:13,379
- How are you going?
- Hey.

475
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:15,739
Zack, how are ya?

476
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:17,819
- Hi. How you doin'?
- Good.

477
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:19,859
- Welcome, I guess.
- Thanks.

478
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:21,819
So this is our house?

479
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:23,539
Yeah. It's weird, eh?

480
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:24,980
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

481
00:47:24,981 --> 00:47:29,740
So, I don't know,
what kind of stuff do you do?

482
00:47:29,741 --> 00:47:31,740
Ah, not much.

483
00:47:31,741 --> 00:47:33,500
Sports or anything?

484
00:47:33,501 --> 00:47:35,900
Yeah, anything without a team. I swim.

485
00:47:35,901 --> 00:47:37,980
That has a team. I'm captain of it.

486
00:47:37,981 --> 00:47:39,780
Oh, cool. Can I be on it?

487
00:47:39,781 --> 00:47:41,860
If you're fast enough.

488
00:47:41,861 --> 00:47:43,740
OK.

489
00:47:43,741 --> 00:47:47,420
School sends away one of our boys to the
institute on a scholarship every year.

490
00:47:47,421 --> 00:47:48,821
Seriously, we're good.

491
00:47:48,822 --> 00:47:51,581
I'll just splash along behind,
make you look good.

492
00:47:51,582 --> 00:47:53,581
That doesn't make us look good.

493
00:47:53,582 --> 00:47:56,501
No, it's a defence. I'm awesome.

494
00:47:56,502 --> 00:47:58,458
So, uh...

495
00:47:59,502 --> 00:48:01,221
You want a tour?

496
00:48:01,222 --> 00:48:03,178
- Yeah, lead on.
- Alright.

497
00:48:05,742 --> 00:48:09,101
How long were your parents separated?

498
00:48:09,102 --> 00:48:11,661
Uh, three years or something.

499
00:48:11,662 --> 00:48:14,742
My dad ditched my mum when I was five.

500
00:48:14,743 --> 00:48:17,702
Bitch kept spending all his money,
so he paid her off in one hit.

501
00:48:17,703 --> 00:48:21,422
- Shit.
- Trust me, it's better like this.

502
00:48:21,423 --> 00:48:23,542
But he really seems...

503
00:48:23,543 --> 00:48:25,342
I don't know, he likes Cassi.

504
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:27,902
- What's she like?
- Oh, she's great. You'll meet her.

505
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:29,382
She's my mum.

506
00:48:29,383 --> 00:48:31,822
- Your dad seems cool.
- Yeah.

507
00:48:31,823 --> 00:48:34,382
He told me to look out for you
while he was away.

508
00:48:34,383 --> 00:48:36,902
Right. So you're the man of the house?

509
00:48:36,903 --> 00:48:38,983
Yeah.

510
00:48:38,984 --> 00:48:41,223
So. First day tomorrow.

511
00:48:41,224 --> 00:48:42,783
Yeah.

512
00:48:42,784 --> 00:48:44,463
Hey, what's our school like?

513
00:48:44,464 --> 00:48:46,943
I haven't really done
the private school thing.

514
00:48:46,944 --> 00:48:49,223
- Well, you'll meet her. She's great.
- Yeah?

515
00:48:49,224 --> 00:48:52,743
I wouldn't call it our school, though.

516
00:48:52,744 --> 00:48:55,895
But... Whose school is it?

517
00:49:40,826 --> 00:49:43,345
Mr Masters,
the principal will see you now.

518
00:49:43,346 --> 00:49:44,779
Great, thanks.

519
00:50:06,027 --> 00:50:08,416
They seem nice.

520
00:50:09,467 --> 00:50:11,776
I could have you charged.

521
00:50:12,827 --> 00:50:16,187
Yeah, you went to the police,
didn't you?

522
00:50:16,188 --> 00:50:17,940
What did they say?

523
00:50:19,668 --> 00:50:22,421
Did they ask if you were sure?

524
00:50:23,468 --> 00:50:25,777
Who else was there?

525
00:50:27,828 --> 00:50:30,547
Did they say they'd look into it?

526
00:50:30,548 --> 00:50:33,016
I think they got about as far as
my lawyer.

527
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:37,587
You think you're untouchable.

528
00:50:37,588 --> 00:50:39,467
I've got witnesses.

529
00:50:39,468 --> 00:50:42,228
Four of them. I've got a reputation.

530
00:50:42,229 --> 00:50:45,388
I win medals for the school.
What do you do?

531
00:50:45,389 --> 00:50:47,468
Raise money for sick monkeys?

532
00:50:47,469 --> 00:50:49,668
- Homeless children.
- Whatever.

533
00:50:49,669 --> 00:50:52,183
Keep your mouth shut.

534
00:50:53,229 --> 00:50:55,588
You've got Darren all excited

535
00:50:55,589 --> 00:50:57,908
and you're running around
talking your bullshit.

536
00:50:57,909 --> 00:51:01,508
Just keep it to yourself,
and everyone will be just fine.

537
00:51:01,509 --> 00:51:06,459
You wouldn't be here
unless you were afraid.

538
00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:10,707
I went and saw the principal today.

539
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:14,548
You know why?

540
00:51:15,590 --> 00:51:18,787
He wanted to see if I was OK.
Don't fucking cry.

541
00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:26,109
Don't come to my house again.

542
00:51:26,110 --> 00:51:29,148
Now you're getting it.

543
00:51:35,151 --> 00:51:39,190
Oh, be sure to thank your mother
for the refreshing cola.

544
00:51:44,231 --> 00:51:46,381
Oh, fuck.

545
00:52:01,232 --> 00:52:03,826
What are you doin'?

546
00:52:07,552 --> 00:52:10,749
Dad? Yeah, hi.

547
00:52:13,072 --> 00:52:15,351
No, no, everything's cool.

548
00:52:15,352 --> 00:52:18,792
I just need to withdraw some funds and
I wanted to run it by you first, though.

549
00:52:18,793 --> 00:52:22,024
Oh, kind of a school project.

550
00:52:23,873 --> 00:52:27,263
Of course it's for a party.
No, everything else is fine.

551
00:52:28,633 --> 00:52:32,192
OK. Alright,
I'll see you when you get back, Dad.

552
00:52:32,193 --> 00:52:36,505
Right. Love you, Dad. Bye.

553
00:53:54,156 --> 00:53:59,676
Have you ever wondered why
kids go to their school with an AK?

554
00:53:59,677 --> 00:54:01,596
Rage issues?

555
00:54:01,597 --> 00:54:04,350
Outrage, maybe.

556
00:54:06,957 --> 00:54:09,116
OK, let's do it.

557
00:54:09,117 --> 00:54:10,996
You in?

558
00:54:10,997 --> 00:54:12,877
We'd have to shoot ourselves after.

559
00:54:12,878 --> 00:54:15,956
Man, you've got to think about it
in terms of a ratio.

560
00:54:15,957 --> 00:54:19,876
Like the guy in Kauhajoki,
he was like 10 to 1. Epic fail.

561
00:54:19,877 --> 00:54:22,717
Virginia Tech was more like 30 to 1.

562
00:54:22,718 --> 00:54:25,877
That's better bang for your buck.

563
00:54:25,878 --> 00:54:28,237
Oh!

564
00:54:28,238 --> 00:54:30,877
So that's one to me.

565
00:54:30,878 --> 00:54:33,551
Dude, what the fuck? That was awesome!

566
00:56:13,682 --> 00:56:16,196
So anyway, I'm leaving.

567
00:56:20,122 --> 00:56:22,401
When?

568
00:56:22,402 --> 00:56:25,282
As soon as I can.

569
00:56:25,283 --> 00:56:30,642
I don't know if you've noticed,
but this place isn't real, anyway.

570
00:56:30,643 --> 00:56:35,962
- It's like some kind of...
- ..parallel universe.

571
00:56:35,963 --> 00:56:41,562
Here we are, trapped in a bubble while
the rest of the world keeps turning.

572
00:56:41,563 --> 00:56:46,402
When we came here, my mum said
that this was the best school

573
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:49,043
because it was the most expensive

574
00:56:49,044 --> 00:56:51,443
- Where is she?
- Away.

575
00:56:51,444 --> 00:56:55,403
She moved here to set me up,
and now I don't even see her.

576
00:57:09,444 --> 00:57:12,517
Do you remember first semester history?

577
00:57:13,565 --> 00:57:18,798
You gave a presentation
on the origin of moral law.

578
00:57:19,845 --> 00:57:22,803
Do you remember what a martyr is?

579
00:57:24,925 --> 00:57:26,524
What are you asking?

580
00:57:26,525 --> 00:57:27,878
Do you?

581
00:57:30,605 --> 00:57:32,641
In Greek, it means 'witness'.

582
00:57:34,805 --> 00:57:38,165
Witnesses were tortured for confessions,

583
00:57:38,166 --> 00:57:40,964
so it came to mean
someone who suffers for a cause.

584
00:57:44,246 --> 00:57:46,362
Do you need my notes?

585
00:57:51,606 --> 00:57:55,125
If you see something and do nothing,
you're not a witness.

586
00:57:55,126 --> 00:57:57,082
You're an accomplice.

587
00:59:12,129 --> 00:59:14,769
It's just training, man.
Don't worry about it.

588
00:59:16,890 --> 00:59:19,927
I only wanted him to give up on her.

589
00:59:21,930 --> 00:59:24,009
She would have been out of it.

590
00:59:24,010 --> 00:59:25,569
Totally.

591
00:59:25,570 --> 00:59:27,800
Do you think I'm stupid?

592
00:59:30,570 --> 00:59:33,209
We're gonna get caught.

593
00:59:36,570 --> 00:59:38,249
Are you going to help me or not?

594
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:39,969
- Chill out, man.
- Come on!

595
01:00:27,212 --> 01:00:29,568
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

596
01:00:32,333 --> 01:00:34,927
When are you leaving?

597
01:00:37,973 --> 01:00:40,292
It's like you said, man.

598
01:00:40,293 --> 01:00:43,132
She's not the problem, but him.

599
01:00:43,133 --> 01:00:48,532
With his pictures and rumours
and all that other bullshit.

600
01:00:48,533 --> 01:00:52,893
He's not taking away
my only ticket out of here.

601
01:00:52,894 --> 01:00:54,964
We have to, bro. Come on.

602
01:01:37,615 --> 01:01:39,287
Boo.

603
01:01:41,456 --> 01:01:43,255
Make it quick. Come on.

604
01:01:43,256 --> 01:01:44,928
Yeeow!

605
01:01:47,896 --> 01:01:49,409
Fuck.

606
01:02:04,336 --> 01:02:06,776
- You go round that way.
- Fuck off.

607
01:02:06,777 --> 01:02:08,654
Move, fucker!

608
01:02:45,018 --> 01:02:46,817
There he is.

609
01:02:46,818 --> 01:02:49,537
Look, there they go!

610
01:03:00,739 --> 01:03:02,695
Fuck!

611
01:03:08,699 --> 01:03:10,417
Where you going?

612
01:03:13,819 --> 01:03:16,014
- He's gone downstairs.
- Where you going, Daz?

613
01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:28,169
Where you going?

614
01:03:59,901 --> 01:04:01,971
Get up, fucker!

615
01:04:24,822 --> 01:04:27,290
Hey, how's that?

616
01:04:29,622 --> 01:04:31,061
Hey?

617
01:04:31,062 --> 01:04:33,502
Brooky. Brooky?

618
01:04:33,503 --> 01:04:35,902
Brooky, Brooky, hop up. Hop up.

619
01:04:35,903 --> 01:04:37,622
You alright?

620
01:04:37,623 --> 01:04:39,422
Did he get you?

621
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:41,582
No.

622
01:04:41,583 --> 01:04:43,813
What a fucking mess.

623
01:04:47,463 --> 01:04:49,182
Darren?

624
01:04:49,183 --> 01:04:52,982
Darren, there are two types of people
in this school.

625
01:04:52,983 --> 01:04:56,100
The first kind are useful to me, OK?

626
01:04:57,144 --> 01:05:00,903
The second kind is what you just became.

627
01:05:00,904 --> 01:05:03,816
Why do you do it?

628
01:05:04,864 --> 01:05:08,583
Why do you need to drag people
so far down

629
01:05:08,584 --> 01:05:11,543
when you're already so far above them?

630
01:05:11,544 --> 01:05:13,423
Here's the trick to it, Daz.

631
01:05:13,424 --> 01:05:15,063
When you're really above people,

632
01:05:15,064 --> 01:05:17,183
you don't have to explain yourself
to anyone.

633
01:05:17,184 --> 01:05:18,856
For anything.

634
01:05:28,905 --> 01:05:31,824
Help him, for fuck's sake.

635
01:05:31,825 --> 01:05:33,984
Jono, get him out of here.

636
01:05:33,985 --> 01:05:35,944
Come on.

637
01:05:35,945 --> 01:05:37,537
Take him home.

638
01:05:39,865 --> 01:05:41,464
Guess he owed him lunch money.

639
01:05:41,465 --> 01:05:43,744
Seriously, though, guys,

640
01:05:43,745 --> 01:05:46,905
if you're going to start believing
all this bullshit he's spinning,

641
01:05:46,906 --> 01:05:49,105
you're going to get dragged down
to his level.

642
01:05:49,106 --> 01:05:53,825
You know? We don't need
that kind of attention. Not here.

643
01:05:53,826 --> 01:05:56,215
I thought we were better than that.

644
01:05:57,626 --> 01:06:01,619
Anyway, somebody call it.
I'm going to class.

645
01:06:10,026 --> 01:06:12,143
