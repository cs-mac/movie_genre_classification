1
00:00:56,923 --> 00:01:00,086
Says your source got religion
while he was in the can.

2
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:02,423
- You trust him?
- No.

3
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,661
Sharp, we're going to a church.

4
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,068
That's why I didn't bring a helicopter.

5
00:01:11,639 --> 00:01:13,732
Everybody, get your hands up.

6
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:16,671
Now keep them up...

7
00:01:16,977 --> 00:01:18,808
and say, "Hey!"

8
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,377
Say, "Oh!"

9
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:25,783
All right. Then go ahead.

10
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,384
We have learned from the three wise
men...

11
00:01:30,792 --> 00:01:32,225
The O'Jays...

12
00:01:33,127 --> 00:01:36,756
Eddie, Walter, and the other guy...

13
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:40,500
that there is a train coming...

14
00:01:40,602 --> 00:01:43,093
and it is a train of love.

15
00:01:44,139 --> 00:01:46,903
Michael rowed his boat ashore.

16
00:01:50,745 --> 00:01:55,648
Because he, too, wanted to get
off that water and get on the train.

17
00:01:55,884 --> 00:01:57,374
<i>Had the ticket.</i>

18
00:02:12,868 --> 00:02:15,735
And I, too, want to be on that same
train.

19
00:02:15,971 --> 00:02:19,532
So I will see everyone next week.
Hopefully.

20
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,684
Percy Stevens. What's it been?

21
00:02:27,785 --> 00:02:30,549
Three to five years with time off
for good behavior?

22
00:02:30,655 --> 00:02:33,021
Sharp, how are you?

23
00:02:34,225 --> 00:02:36,887
This is a church, all right?

24
00:02:36,994 --> 00:02:40,191
A place that's sacred.
And it shall remain untainted.

25
00:02:40,297 --> 00:02:43,460
We're looking for an old cellmate of
yours, Morgan Ball. You seen him?

26
00:02:43,567 --> 00:02:45,432
He's a key witness in one of my cases.

27
00:02:45,536 --> 00:02:49,063
Come on, man.
I don't hang with that crowd anymore.

28
00:02:49,774 --> 00:02:53,210
I am a prophet in a nonprofit world.

29
00:03:15,268 --> 00:03:18,066
Aren't you worried about him getting
away?

30
00:03:21,607 --> 00:03:24,770
I'm more worried
about him having a heart attack.

31
00:03:48,169 --> 00:03:50,603
You want me to call an ambulance for
you?

32
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,440
Look, man, I don't even know
why I'm running in the first place.

33
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,909
I'm on God's side now.

34
00:03:58,012 --> 00:03:59,980
Give us the phone, Percy.

35
00:04:00,915 --> 00:04:04,715
Man, why are you all treating me
like I'm some little punk kid?

36
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,978
Besides, the Lord says:

37
00:04:07,088 --> 00:04:10,080
"He who is without sin cast the first
stone."

38
00:04:11,393 --> 00:04:14,385
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- It slipped.

39
00:04:15,097 --> 00:04:17,088
Where's the damn phone at?

40
00:04:26,008 --> 00:04:27,236
Holy cow!

41
00:04:27,909 --> 00:04:30,810
It's a musical cow. Look at it. It's a
miracle.

42
00:04:30,912 --> 00:04:33,073
Like the parting of the Red Sea.

43
00:04:33,181 --> 00:04:36,412
Or the time I saw Mike Tyson's face
in a taco.

44
00:04:36,618 --> 00:04:38,586
What is he doing?

45
00:04:39,021 --> 00:04:41,888
No. I know he's not about to do that.
Come on, man.

46
00:04:41,991 --> 00:04:43,982
He gonna really put his hand up that
cow?

47
00:04:44,126 --> 00:04:47,186
You can't do that.
It's against the cow's rights, man.

48
00:04:48,064 --> 00:04:49,554
What's up with the...

49
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:51,963
All the way... In the hand...

50
00:04:58,209 --> 00:04:59,642
It's for you.

51
00:05:07,818 --> 00:05:08,944
Hello.

52
00:05:09,153 --> 00:05:11,951
Hey, Morgan. Calm down, man.

53
00:05:12,623 --> 00:05:15,786
All units, stand by for the whereabouts
of our friend Morgan Ball.

54
00:05:34,946 --> 00:05:36,538
They're coming in.

55
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:41,584
Texas Rangers looking for Morgan Ball!
Sure hope we don't have the wrong house!

56
00:05:41,687 --> 00:05:43,052
Go to hell!

57
00:06:16,156 --> 00:06:18,147
Morgan, don't run.

58
00:06:34,742 --> 00:06:37,370
Eddie Zane, FBI.
How the hell did that fire start?

59
00:06:37,478 --> 00:06:39,036
I don't know. We heard some shots.

60
00:06:39,147 --> 00:06:41,615
- Who's in there?
- Sharp and Swanson.

61
00:06:42,784 --> 00:06:43,978
Christ.

62
00:06:50,092 --> 00:06:52,287
hey!
You know what's in those barrels, right?

63
00:06:52,394 --> 00:06:54,862
One wrong shot and we could all go.

64
00:06:56,565 --> 00:06:59,398
Look, Ball, you have three choices:

65
00:06:59,635 --> 00:07:03,071
A: You could stay in this hellhole
and burn to death.

66
00:07:03,505 --> 00:07:07,202
B: You can come with us
and testify against John Cortland.

67
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:08,935
A and B suck.

68
00:07:09,244 --> 00:07:10,768
What about C?

69
00:07:11,113 --> 00:07:13,206
C is my personal favorite.

70
00:07:13,883 --> 00:07:15,282
Take it easy.

71
00:07:15,384 --> 00:07:17,909
I'm sure there's a way
we can work out this whole thing.

72
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,784
Seems like it's pretty well worked out
to me.

73
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:23,256
I got money. Lots of money.

74
00:07:23,626 --> 00:07:26,151
If you get me out of here,
I'll make you both rich.

75
00:07:26,262 --> 00:07:29,322
Look, see this key? It's yours.

76
00:07:29,431 --> 00:07:31,422
Thank you. I'll put that in evidence.

77
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:35,664
Look, I can't testify. Cortland will
kill me. It's a death sentence.

78
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:39,433
Let's go outside and talk it over.

79
00:07:56,361 --> 00:07:58,295
You gotta be kidding me.

80
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:00,722
Nice job, Sharp.

81
00:08:00,965 --> 00:08:03,593
What's that they say?
"Texas Rangers always get their man"?

82
00:08:03,601 --> 00:08:05,432
That's the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police.

83
00:08:05,537 --> 00:08:08,063
You both have funny hats and funny
boots. Who can tell you apart?

84
00:08:08,373 --> 00:08:10,068
- Long time, Eddie.
- More than five years.

85
00:08:10,175 --> 00:08:13,576
Margaret Swanson, Eddie Zane.
He's with the Federal Bureau of Idiots.

86
00:08:13,678 --> 00:08:16,409
I'd have become a Ranger if they said my
partner would look like you.

87
00:08:16,515 --> 00:08:19,484
If you were a Ranger, you'd have caught
this bastard by yourself.

88
00:08:19,585 --> 00:08:22,213
That's the beautiful thing about working
for the federal government.

89
00:08:22,321 --> 00:08:24,118
Other people do your grunt work for you.

90
00:08:28,294 --> 00:08:30,023
- How's your daughter doing?
- Real good.

91
00:08:30,129 --> 00:08:31,824
Excuse me, I'm bleeding here.

92
00:08:34,467 --> 00:08:35,695
Get down!

93
00:08:42,442 --> 00:08:43,636
You're gonna be okay.

94
00:08:43,743 --> 00:08:46,337
Just hang in there. EMT is on the way.

95
00:10:42,301 --> 00:10:45,600
Oh, my God, you guys. It is so hot out
there.

96
00:10:45,704 --> 00:10:47,433
I'm so hot, I think I'm sweaty.

97
00:10:47,539 --> 00:10:50,872
Oh, God. I need to get some air.

98
00:10:56,214 --> 00:10:59,047
Oh, my God. You guys, come here.

99
00:10:59,217 --> 00:11:01,048
- What?
- Just come here.

100
00:11:01,219 --> 00:11:03,153
Guys, come here.

101
00:11:06,391 --> 00:11:08,188
I think this guy got mugged or
something.

102
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:09,351
- What?
- Where?

103
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:11,656
- Should we call the cops?
- No.

104
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:15,892
I think this guy's coming to help him.

105
00:11:21,006 --> 00:11:23,167
<i>Once again, put it together...</i>

106
00:11:23,275 --> 00:11:28,110
<i>for the lovely ladies</i> <i>of your
Texas Longhorn cheer squad.</i>

107
00:11:38,225 --> 00:11:39,522
What the hell happened?

108
00:11:39,627 --> 00:11:42,892
I heard a shot.
I turned the corner, I got clipped.

109
00:11:43,964 --> 00:11:46,489
- Did you get a good look at him?
- No.

110
00:12:00,915 --> 00:12:02,041
Hello.

111
00:12:02,129 --> 00:12:03,892
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

112
00:12:04,498 --> 00:12:07,244
- I ordered for you.
- Good.

113
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,270
- Medium rare, right?
- Yeah.

114
00:12:12,462 --> 00:12:13,895
How's school?

115
00:12:13,996 --> 00:12:16,328
You know. The usual.

116
00:12:16,684 --> 00:12:18,174
How's your mom?

117
00:12:18,987 --> 00:12:22,303
I wouldn't really know.
She and Keith took up scuba diving.

118
00:12:22,345 --> 00:12:26,805
Anyway, she was cleaning the house
and she wanted you to have these.

119
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:35,506
This is a beautiful picture of you and
your mom there in little bathing suits.

120
00:12:35,556 --> 00:12:37,547
Oh, there's that donkey.

121
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:44,089
I keep looking for a picture of you and
me, but I guess I was always taking the
pictures.

122
00:12:44,383 --> 00:12:46,248
No, you were just never there.

123
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,168
Or that.

124
00:12:51,132 --> 00:12:55,034
So, I'm applying to a few colleges.
Rice, SMU and...

125
00:12:55,866 --> 00:12:56,992
Sharp.

126
00:12:58,585 --> 00:13:00,280
Yeah, I'm on my way.

127
00:13:02,903 --> 00:13:05,736
- Look, I've got to...
- Go. I get it.

128
00:13:10,611 --> 00:13:11,737
Sorry.

129
00:13:12,403 --> 00:13:13,597
I'm fine.

130
00:13:23,342 --> 00:13:26,038
- Looks like you've been busy.
- Yes, sir.

131
00:13:26,861 --> 00:13:28,852
- Hell, ain't it?
- Yes, sir.

132
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,058
They said you had some witnesses.

133
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:33,514
Yeah, they came waltzing in here
about a half hour ago.

134
00:13:33,545 --> 00:13:34,944
Said they saw the whole thing.

135
00:13:34,985 --> 00:13:37,100
- Anybody else know about this?
- No.

136
00:13:37,127 --> 00:13:39,844
Can we keep it that way?
I'm tired of being shot at.

137
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:41,107
You bet.

138
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,215
Who are your witnesses?

139
00:13:43,717 --> 00:13:45,150
Cheerleaders.

140
00:13:47,331 --> 00:13:49,606
<i>You know, I think we could be on the
news.</i>

141
00:13:49,635 --> 00:13:53,571
<i>I'm not talking local.</i> <i>I'm
thinking maybe Katie Couric or Oprah.</i>

142
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:55,726
<i>We shouldn't have come here.</i>

143
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,273
<i>I need to get to the library.</i>

144
00:13:57,312 --> 00:14:00,975
<i>Now I'll never get my psych paper
done.</i> <i>I'll just keep seeing his
head explode.</i>

145
00:14:01,021 --> 00:14:02,511
<i>Evie, remember what we said?</i>

146
00:14:02,557 --> 00:14:06,584
<i>You got to breathe.</i> <i>Let air in,
and now let that air out, okay?</i>

147
00:14:07,003 --> 00:14:08,561
I totally have a double chin.

148
00:14:08,602 --> 00:14:09,728
I don't trust cops.

149
00:14:09,786 --> 00:14:12,123
We shouldn't say anything
till our lawyers get here.

150
00:14:12,153 --> 00:14:14,742
<i>We don't need lawyers.</i>
<i>We didn't do anything.</i>

151
00:14:14,775 --> 00:14:17,839
<i>Relax, everybody.</i> <i>We just came
here to tell them what we saw.</i>

152
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:19,904
- Do we have to?
- Yes.

153
00:14:20,085 --> 00:14:23,401
As cheerleaders, we're role models to
the community at large.

154
00:14:23,443 --> 00:14:26,096
If we don't do the right thing,
how can we expect others to?

155
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:27,688
Now I'm gonna throw up.

156
00:14:27,729 --> 00:14:30,320
I'm not gonna be staying here all night
long.

157
00:14:30,353 --> 00:14:33,921
Why don't we just tell these people
that we need to reschedule for tomorrow?

158
00:14:33,967 --> 00:14:36,273
Well, I can't do morning.
I'm having my legs waxed.

159
00:14:36,302 --> 00:14:37,997
I have a biochem lab at noon.

160
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:41,062
I'm good between 2:30 and 4:00.
Would that work for everybody?

161
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,727
Don't work for me.

162
00:14:43,915 --> 00:14:45,041
And who are you?

163
00:14:45,099 --> 00:14:47,499
Roland Sharp, Texas Ranger.

164
00:14:47,688 --> 00:14:49,451
Oh, my God. Do you know Derek Jeter?

165
00:14:49,481 --> 00:14:52,734
No, he means the other Texas Rangers.
You know, like the Lone Ranger.

166
00:14:52,775 --> 00:14:55,807
He had that cool Indian friend.
What was his name?

167
00:14:55,846 --> 00:14:56,938
Tonto?

168
00:14:56,997 --> 00:15:00,061
He was hot.
Why don't guys wear loincloths anymore?

169
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,826
A Texas Ranger was shot this evening in
connection to the murder you witnessed.

170
00:15:03,874 --> 00:15:06,242
Anything you remember,
no matter how insignificant...

171
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:08,570
may be of the utmost importance.

172
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:14,307
- Do you want a piece?
- No, I do not.

173
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:15,925
- You don't like gum?
- No.

174
00:15:15,964 --> 00:15:19,817
Chewing gum is the most significant
factor in the decline of Western
civilization.

175
00:15:19,866 --> 00:15:21,128
The decline of what?

176
00:15:21,179 --> 00:15:23,990
When people chew gum,
nobody can read their expressions.

177
00:15:24,026 --> 00:15:25,584
Like with BOTOX.

178
00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:36,914
I like an older man
who knows what he wants.

179
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:39,076
All right.

180
00:15:39,826 --> 00:15:41,815
We should so not get involved in this.

181
00:15:41,841 --> 00:15:43,862
Oh, God, here she goes again.

182
00:15:43,888 --> 00:15:46,225
- She do this a lot?
- Whenever she gets nervous.

183
00:15:46,255 --> 00:15:48,687
She drops, like, 10 pounds around
finals.

184
00:15:48,718 --> 00:15:50,707
Can anybody describe the perpetrator?

185
00:15:50,733 --> 00:15:52,098
"Perpetrator"?

186
00:15:52,524 --> 00:15:54,492
The bad man with the gun.

187
00:15:54,636 --> 00:15:56,561
Actually, he was kind of cute.

188
00:15:56,586 --> 00:16:00,755
Gross. He was a total skank.
On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give him a 4.

189
00:16:00,808 --> 00:16:03,872
No, a ruthless killer's kind of sexy.
I give him an 8.

190
00:16:03,911 --> 00:16:06,595
Let's try to concentrate. How tall was
he?

191
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,325
Average. Like, 5'10".

192
00:16:08,357 --> 00:16:10,120
No way. 6'2" at least.

193
00:16:10,149 --> 00:16:11,878
I thought he was kind of short.

194
00:16:11,909 --> 00:16:13,501
What about his hair?

195
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:15,097
Definitely needs to rethink his cut.

196
00:16:15,138 --> 00:16:19,813
- I mean the color of his hair.
- It was dark. Almost black.

197
00:16:19,873 --> 00:16:21,170
I thought it was blond.

198
00:16:21,215 --> 00:16:23,706
- What?
- This is bad.

199
00:16:24,926 --> 00:16:26,553
Did he have any...

200
00:16:27,229 --> 00:16:30,357
distinctive facial characteristics?

201
00:16:36,154 --> 00:16:39,123
Sideburns? A mustache?

202
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:42,690
- There might've been a mustache.
- No, definitely not.

203
00:16:42,774 --> 00:16:45,265
Was I the only one who saw a goatee?

204
00:16:57,616 --> 00:16:59,311
Look at these guys.

205
00:16:59,567 --> 00:17:01,057
You guys, wait.

206
00:17:03,693 --> 00:17:07,720
Wait. Looks like your ex-boyfriend,
Brook Burton.

207
00:17:07,787 --> 00:17:09,277
No, he doesn't.

208
00:17:10,922 --> 00:17:12,355
Morning, Cap.

209
00:17:12,745 --> 00:17:14,178
The Dixie Chicks here...

210
00:17:14,216 --> 00:17:18,846
looked at 5,759 mug shots last night.

211
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:23,571
<i>Wee. Look at this bad boy.</i>

212
00:17:23,972 --> 00:17:24,961
<i>He is yummy!</i>

213
00:17:25,027 --> 00:17:28,793
<i>He's kind of a cross between</i>
<i>the Unabomber and Mark Wahlberg.</i>

214
00:17:31,201 --> 00:17:34,391
I now know the hottie rating
of every ex-convict...

215
00:17:34,432 --> 00:17:36,627
in the western United States.

216
00:17:36,831 --> 00:17:40,096
Been up all night,
haven't learned a goddamn thing.

217
00:17:40,733 --> 00:17:43,197
<i>Please tell me this sweet thing</i>
<i>is out on parole.</i>

218
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,122
<i>Look at him. He's fine.</i>

219
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,114
<i>Girl, good.</i>

220
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:49,503
<i>Oh, my God, you guys,</i> <i>I think
this guy is in my poli- sci class.</i>

221
00:17:49,945 --> 00:17:53,244
They all said they could ID that feller
if they saw him again.

222
00:17:59,732 --> 00:18:03,600
That's a two-way mirror, girl.
People are watching you.

223
00:18:03,986 --> 00:18:05,146
I know.

224
00:18:09,008 --> 00:18:10,635
What do you think?

225
00:18:14,286 --> 00:18:16,345
I don't know what to think.

226
00:18:23,306 --> 00:18:24,898
I feel really...

227
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:27,881
old.

228
00:18:30,695 --> 00:18:31,992
Excuse me, Captain.

229
00:18:32,038 --> 00:18:36,202
The Governor's office just called.

230
00:18:37,668 --> 00:18:38,726
Good.

231
00:18:45,185 --> 00:18:47,174
Thanks for coming, fellas.

232
00:18:47,199 --> 00:18:51,053
I'm getting phone calls from some
daddies that are worried about their
daughters.

233
00:18:51,102 --> 00:18:53,059
They have good reason to be concerned,
sir.

234
00:18:53,085 --> 00:18:56,560
If Cortland finds out there are
witnesses, he'll come after them sure as
hell.

235
00:18:56,604 --> 00:19:00,236
Gentlemen, I told those guys we'd take
care of their daughters. Stay with them.

236
00:19:00,282 --> 00:19:02,443
- Yes, sir.
- Good luck, Roland.

237
00:19:29,452 --> 00:19:32,484
Is the taller blond Anne or Barb?
I can't remember their names.

238
00:19:32,523 --> 00:19:34,081
- HE-BAT.
- "He" what?

239
00:19:34,123 --> 00:19:35,818
HE-BAT. It's a mnemonic device, son.

240
00:19:35,851 --> 00:19:38,786
Heather, Evie, Barbara, Anne, Teresa.
HE-BAT.

241
00:19:39,368 --> 00:19:41,232
This is a plainclothes operation.

242
00:19:41,256 --> 00:19:44,224
Take your hat off. Conceal your badge.
Try to look normal.

243
00:19:44,262 --> 00:19:48,305
Yes, sir. And I just want to say thank
you for taking me along on this one,
sir.

244
00:19:48,357 --> 00:19:50,441
That's the third time today
you've thanked me...

245
00:19:50,468 --> 00:19:54,598
and I can honestly say at this point
I feel the full brunt of your gratitude.

246
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:56,981
Thank you again, sir.

247
00:19:57,024 --> 00:19:58,753
Get in the damn van.

248
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,147
You, move over.

249
00:20:02,719 --> 00:20:05,984
You think you could turn some music on
or something?

250
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:13,564
- Turn the motor off.
- Problem, sir?

251
00:20:13,593 --> 00:20:15,060
We don't have a secure cabin.

252
00:20:15,097 --> 00:20:17,908
This vehicle will not move
until all these ladies buckle up.

253
00:20:17,944 --> 00:20:19,070
You're kidding, right?

254
00:20:19,127 --> 00:20:23,689
One thing you'll learn about me is I do
not kid, or jest, or joke, or jape...

255
00:20:23,861 --> 00:20:25,055
or quip.

256
00:20:29,746 --> 00:20:32,442
Looks like we're waiting on you, Teresa.

257
00:20:33,361 --> 00:20:34,692
I saw that.

258
00:20:41,102 --> 00:20:42,660
I saw that, too.

259
00:20:44,715 --> 00:20:46,273
I see everything.

260
00:20:55,111 --> 00:20:58,712
Mr. Cortland, do you expect any further
charges to be filed against you?

261
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:01,758
Mr. Cortland,
how do you feel about the verdict?

262
00:21:01,796 --> 00:21:03,559
After failing to produce any evidence...

263
00:21:03,587 --> 00:21:06,682
the government has dropped all charges
against John W. Cortland.

264
00:21:06,722 --> 00:21:09,343
Needless to say,
my client is pleased with this outcome.

265
00:21:09,377 --> 00:21:12,125
What about the murder
of a key government witness last night?

266
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,381
If you'll excuse us, Mr. Cortland
is anxious to get home to his family.

267
00:21:15,422 --> 00:21:16,684
No further comment.

268
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,894
Are you denying any prior knowledge?

269
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:33,437
Zane.

270
00:21:33,494 --> 00:21:36,463
<i>It's me. I still don't have the
money</i> <i>Ball stole from me.</i>

271
00:21:36,501 --> 00:21:38,996
<i>And the shooter you brought in</i>
<i>shot a Ranger.</i>

272
00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:41,080
I covered for him. The job got done.

273
00:21:41,106 --> 00:21:44,076
<i>Even shot myself in the arm.</i>
<i>You're a free man.</i>

274
00:21:44,114 --> 00:21:47,550
Yeah, well, here's the thing.
You left some witnesses.

275
00:21:47,665 --> 00:21:49,530
Hey, pull up over here.

276
00:21:54,221 --> 00:21:58,715
Now you listen here.
You better start cleaning this mess up.

277
00:21:59,082 --> 00:22:00,640
Already on it.

278
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:36,617
I got to shower.

279
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:39,667
Triple-lock all the doors, put magnetic
contacts on all the windows.

280
00:22:39,705 --> 00:22:41,070
I only want one port of entry.

281
00:22:41,112 --> 00:22:44,807
Y'all can put your audio and visual
stuff upstairs and downstairs.

282
00:22:44,854 --> 00:22:48,771
I want you to check all the crawl
spaces, if they got any, for outside
access.

283
00:22:48,821 --> 00:22:52,895
Put a tap on that telephone and a bunch
of Barq's Root Beer in the refrigerator.

284
00:22:52,947 --> 00:22:54,539
Where do you want your stuff at, sir?

285
00:22:54,579 --> 00:22:56,631
On the couch in the front room,
facing the door.

286
00:22:56,658 --> 00:22:59,149
Yes, sir. Where do we bed down, sir?

287
00:22:59,792 --> 00:23:02,454
With that bunch of scholars over there.

288
00:23:09,036 --> 00:23:10,264
Have fun.

289
00:23:17,065 --> 00:23:20,728
Ladies, if I might have y'all assemble
in the living area.

290
00:23:36,801 --> 00:23:38,769
Is my root beer in the refrigerator?

291
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:41,040
Root beer? No, sir.

292
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,020
Then why are you still here?

293
00:23:45,756 --> 00:23:48,662
Antonio? Baby! Where are you?

294
00:23:48,699 --> 00:23:51,383
- It's her boyfriend.
- It's a very codependent relationship.

295
00:23:51,417 --> 00:23:54,481
Well, at least I have a relationship.
What do you have? Nothing.

296
00:23:54,521 --> 00:23:57,354
Antonio.
Teresa's gonna have to get back to you.

297
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:06,015
You couldn't possibly be talking about
my mother because she's allergic to
dogs.

298
00:24:06,067 --> 00:24:09,257
- First rule: no cellphones.
- What?

299
00:24:09,297 --> 00:24:13,087
No pagers, no Palm Pilots and no e-mail.

300
00:24:13,136 --> 00:24:17,274
And the telephone downstairs may be used
in the event of emergencies only.

301
00:24:17,326 --> 00:24:18,691
Give it up.

302
00:24:19,245 --> 00:24:21,582
Send us back to the Stone Age,
why don't you?

303
00:24:21,612 --> 00:24:23,697
You don't understand
what serious business this is.

304
00:24:23,724 --> 00:24:26,787
In order for us to do our job,
we're gonna need your cooperation...

305
00:24:26,826 --> 00:24:28,878
and that means paying attention
to what I say...

306
00:24:28,905 --> 00:24:31,337
and doing what I ask you to do
when I ask you to do it.

307
00:24:31,368 --> 00:24:35,158
Furthermore, I'd appreciate it if you'd
cover yourselves in our presence.

308
00:24:35,206 --> 00:24:36,969
I realize how very proud you are...

309
00:24:36,997 --> 00:24:39,966
of your tattoos, piercings,
and other body modifications.

310
00:24:40,004 --> 00:24:42,593
However, my colleagues and I
do not need to see these.

311
00:24:42,626 --> 00:24:43,854
Are there any questions?

312
00:24:43,906 --> 00:24:46,717
I have one. Are you always such a dick?

313
00:24:46,753 --> 00:24:49,658
Yes. There will be no guests
in the house ever.

314
00:24:49,695 --> 00:24:52,537
Nobody may leave the house
without an escort.

315
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,064
But this is our house.

316
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:56,889
What about classes?
I'm in an advanced pre-med program.

317
00:24:56,924 --> 00:24:59,103
- I have a--
- 4.0, we know.

318
00:24:59,132 --> 00:25:03,080
Okay, guys. If I miss my biochem class,
I'm gonna lose my scholarship.

319
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:04,757
There are five of y'all, three of us.

320
00:25:04,793 --> 00:25:07,982
You'll have to pare your schedules down
to the absolute essentials.

321
00:25:08,023 --> 00:25:10,518
I'll skip all my classes
for the greater good of the group.

322
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,778
Work it out amongst yourselves.

323
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:14,957
- What about dates? Barb's got two
tonight. - Not anymore.

324
00:25:14,997 --> 00:25:17,366
Hello! We've got a game on Saturday.

325
00:25:17,396 --> 00:25:19,574
Don't even think about telling us
we're not going.

326
00:25:19,602 --> 00:25:20,899
You're not going.

327
00:25:20,947 --> 00:25:22,244
Don't say it.

328
00:25:22,289 --> 00:25:26,774
As captain of this squad, I must inform
you that to stop us from cheerleading...

329
00:25:26,831 --> 00:25:30,767
you're gonna have to pry the pom-poms
from our cold, dead hands.

330
00:25:47,558 --> 00:25:49,025
I'm all clear.

331
00:25:50,693 --> 00:25:53,915
Come on, Asst. Cheerleading Coach Sharp,
show me your spirit.

332
00:25:53,956 --> 00:25:55,514
Where's your happy face?

333
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:57,352
This is my happy face.

334
00:25:57,826 --> 00:26:01,626
Well, I think we're gonna have to turn
that frown upside down.

335
00:26:01,793 --> 00:26:06,696
Now this cannot be how you helped
Florida State to the regional finals.

336
00:26:07,134 --> 00:26:09,217
- Coach Beauregard?
- Please, Binky.

337
00:26:09,244 --> 00:26:10,575
Okay, Binky.

338
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,767
I specialize in strength and
conditioning...

339
00:26:12,795 --> 00:26:15,954
and I'm gonna leave the grinning
and the smiling up to you.

340
00:26:15,994 --> 00:26:19,930
Well, okey-dokey then.
Assignment accepted.

341
00:26:24,151 --> 00:26:25,379
<i>Time-out...</i>

342
00:26:25,526 --> 00:26:26,652
<i>Texas.</i>

343
00:27:05,347 --> 00:27:06,371
Gun!

344
00:27:21,341 --> 00:27:22,467
A water gun, sir.

345
00:27:22,524 --> 00:27:24,685
Please don't hurt me. It's just a joke.

346
00:27:33,368 --> 00:27:34,596
Nice hit!

347
00:28:22,306 --> 00:28:23,739
Check it out.

348
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:32,148
Howdy, neighbor.

349
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:34,798
I'm Jimmy from next door.

350
00:28:35,068 --> 00:28:38,479
Just wanted to come by
and welcome you to the building.

351
00:28:38,523 --> 00:28:42,687
And, you know,
if you need any weed or anything...

352
00:28:43,609 --> 00:28:45,600
just come bang on my door.

353
00:28:47,127 --> 00:28:49,186
That's good to know, Jimmy.

354
00:28:49,303 --> 00:28:52,204
- You'll definitely be hearing from us.
- Cool.

355
00:28:55,443 --> 00:28:56,808
2200 hours.

356
00:28:56,851 --> 00:28:58,443
<i>HE-BAT is secure.</i>

357
00:28:58,482 --> 00:29:01,349
Roger that. We'll see y'all in the
morning.

358
00:29:14,027 --> 00:29:15,494
I don't sleep.

359
00:29:18,377 --> 00:29:20,311
Isn't that your partner?

360
00:29:23,271 --> 00:29:26,604
- Shouldn't you have gone to the
hospital? - No.

361
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:28,658
I'm here.

362
00:29:28,997 --> 00:29:31,056
Right. But she's been shot.

363
00:29:31,108 --> 00:29:32,973
That's part of the job.

364
00:29:36,673 --> 00:29:38,766
You ever kill anyone, Sharp?

365
00:29:51,835 --> 00:29:54,531
Cold bastard probably doesn't even care.

366
00:30:01,495 --> 00:30:03,463
Her middle name is Ellen.

367
00:30:05,204 --> 00:30:08,678
A lot of the fellas weren't happy when
the Rangers started recruiting women...

368
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:10,953
and I was sure enough one of them.

369
00:30:13,713 --> 00:30:15,442
She changed my mind.

370
00:30:19,502 --> 00:30:21,367
I also hear everything.

371
00:30:23,309 --> 00:30:26,688
"The brightness of her cheek
would shame those stars

372
00:30:26,731 --> 00:30:28,815
"As daylight doth a lamp

373
00:30:28,842 --> 00:30:31,115
"her eyes in heaven

374
00:30:31,145 --> 00:30:33,420
"Would through the airy region
stream so bright

375
00:30:33,449 --> 00:30:37,010
"That birds would sing
and think it were not night"

376
00:30:37,703 --> 00:30:41,935
So your assignment is
to write a five-page paper...

377
00:30:41,989 --> 00:30:43,752
due a week from Friday...

378
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:46,875
describing the function
of the recurrent imagery...

379
00:30:46,915 --> 00:30:50,010
of light against darkness
in <i>Romeo and Juliet.</i>

380
00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:53,143
What does it mean? How does it mean it?

381
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:56,348
And is it possible that this play...

382
00:30:56,382 --> 00:30:59,943
is more than just a teenage romance
with a sad ending?

383
00:31:03,356 --> 00:31:07,087
Miss Thompson.
I want to see you in my office. Now.

384
00:31:16,278 --> 00:31:18,456
- She'd like to see you.
- What for?

385
00:31:18,484 --> 00:31:19,951
I don't know.

386
00:31:23,954 --> 00:31:27,082
Mr. Sharp. Come in. Have a seat.

387
00:31:32,334 --> 00:31:35,397
So, I understand you're
the new assistant cheerleading coach.

388
00:31:35,437 --> 00:31:36,461
That's right.

389
00:31:36,525 --> 00:31:38,419
May I ask what you were doing in my
class?

390
00:31:38,444 --> 00:31:42,613
That's the way we do things on our
squad. If somebody's in the--

391
00:31:42,666 --> 00:31:44,719
Let me be blunt, Mr. Sharp.

392
00:31:44,745 --> 00:31:47,839
Barb's cheerleading
is interfering with her work.

393
00:31:48,008 --> 00:31:51,229
And for the record, you should know
I think cheerleading is stupid.

394
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:53,568
I couldn't agree with you more.

395
00:31:54,661 --> 00:31:58,654
She downloaded this paper
on plant imagery in <i>Macbeth</i>...

396
00:31:58,787 --> 00:32:00,186
off the Internet.

397
00:32:00,227 --> 00:32:04,357
I know, because I wrote it 20 years ago
when I was an undergraduate.

398
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:06,663
Must be a hell of a paper.

399
00:32:07,583 --> 00:32:09,983
Yes, I thought it was pretty good.

400
00:32:10,462 --> 00:32:14,922
But that is not the point.
Plagiarism is simply not acceptable.

401
00:32:15,068 --> 00:32:17,468
I've given Barb an F on that assignment.

402
00:32:17,499 --> 00:32:21,194
If she wants to remain on the squad,
or in the school, for that matter...

403
00:32:21,241 --> 00:32:24,810
her next paper on <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>
had better be wholly original.

404
00:32:24,856 --> 00:32:26,585
I'll explain your position to Barb...

405
00:32:26,614 --> 00:32:29,845
and make sure she understands it,
explicitly.

406
00:32:31,029 --> 00:32:32,360
Well, good.

407
00:32:33,843 --> 00:32:34,901
Fine.

408
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:40,682
Okay, what's the big deal?
Presidents don't write their speeches.

409
00:32:40,721 --> 00:32:44,258
When you're President, you can be
as lenient as you want to on plagiarism.

410
00:32:44,303 --> 00:32:46,292
But wait. This play has five acts.

411
00:32:46,318 --> 00:32:48,339
She can't expect me to read the whole
thing.

412
00:32:48,365 --> 00:32:50,986
It's all written in ye olde
weird English anyway.

413
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:53,648
- Hey, Barb.
- Hi, Scoot.

414
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:58,068
Besides, people think being a
cheerleader is this nonstop party and
everything...

415
00:32:58,121 --> 00:32:59,984
but, you know, they're so wrong.

416
00:33:00,008 --> 00:33:01,839
- Hey, Barb.
- Hi, Chase.

417
00:33:02,054 --> 00:33:04,328
Aside from all my games and my
practices...

418
00:33:04,358 --> 00:33:08,149
they still expect me to maintain
this 2.0 average, and I can't do that.

419
00:33:08,197 --> 00:33:09,858
You need to manage your time better.

420
00:33:09,892 --> 00:33:13,114
Time? What time? I don't have any time.

421
00:33:13,155 --> 00:33:15,491
- Hey, Barb.
- Hi, Tim.

422
00:33:15,521 --> 00:33:18,456
- Tom.
- Shoot! Sorry. Tom.

423
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:20,042
I really liked him, too.

424
00:33:20,095 --> 00:33:22,558
You got some admirers on this campus,
don't you?

425
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:25,180
Don't be jealous. They're just silly
boys.

426
00:33:25,213 --> 00:33:28,055
We can stop this charade
and run away together.

427
00:33:28,092 --> 00:33:29,889
You got a paper to write.

428
00:33:29,915 --> 00:33:32,441
I know. But if I write it myself,
it'll just be stupid.

429
00:33:32,474 --> 00:33:34,400
You don't know that
because you haven't tried.

430
00:33:34,425 --> 00:33:36,667
Cheating is a hell of a lot worse
than being stupid.

431
00:33:36,696 --> 00:33:41,156
Plagiarism is an academic crime.
It is punishable by academic death.

432
00:33:42,965 --> 00:33:44,057
What do you care anyway?

433
00:33:44,117 --> 00:33:48,178
I wanna see you stay alive,
academically, physically, and every
other way.

434
00:33:48,882 --> 00:33:50,975
- You like me, don't you?
- No.

435
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:24,403
<i>Guys, stand by one moment.</i>

436
00:34:25,027 --> 00:34:26,392
Sergeant, your pizza's here.

437
00:34:27,105 --> 00:34:28,436
Roger that.

438
00:34:32,096 --> 00:34:33,825
Set the pizza on the porch...

439
00:34:33,855 --> 00:34:37,450
take two steps back,
and place your hands behind your head.

440
00:34:54,166 --> 00:34:55,326
What's the problem, dude?

441
00:34:55,381 --> 00:34:58,077
If that pizza's hot,
there won't be any problem.

442
00:35:09,231 --> 00:35:12,223
- All right, what do I owe you?
- $13.75.

443
00:35:16,971 --> 00:35:19,719
Hey, do you live here with all these
girls?

444
00:35:19,755 --> 00:35:21,120
Temporarily.

445
00:35:21,226 --> 00:35:23,194
Dude, you're my new hero.

446
00:35:24,328 --> 00:35:26,523
Imagine what that means to me.

447
00:35:32,804 --> 00:35:34,863
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

448
00:35:36,003 --> 00:35:39,063
Without my phone, I am nothing,
I am worthless.

449
00:35:39,202 --> 00:35:41,534
I need to speak to my Antonio...

450
00:35:45,216 --> 00:35:47,411
- What is that?
- The Carnivore.

451
00:35:47,806 --> 00:35:52,539
Pepperoni, sausage, ground beef, ham,
and olive loaf, all together in one
savory pie.

452
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:55,309
With jalapeños.

453
00:35:55,579 --> 00:35:57,513
- Want some?
- Yes. No.

454
00:35:57,785 --> 00:35:59,377
Extra-thick crust.

455
00:35:59,418 --> 00:36:01,469
- I can't. I'm on the Zone.
- What zone?

456
00:36:01,495 --> 00:36:04,054
The proper combination
of protein, fat, and carbohydrates.

457
00:36:04,087 --> 00:36:05,918
This combination's proper as hell.

458
00:36:05,942 --> 00:36:07,375
I'm a total Atkins girl.

459
00:36:07,413 --> 00:36:08,675
I do Weight Watchers.

460
00:36:08,724 --> 00:36:11,472
You'll probably blow all your daily
points with just one bite.

461
00:36:11,507 --> 00:36:16,069
This baby has one point and one point
only, and that is tasting good.

462
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:20,731
I don't know why you girls are on a
diet. You couldn't weigh any more than--

463
00:36:21,263 --> 00:36:22,628
Don't even go there.

464
00:36:22,671 --> 00:36:25,229
No, there are some things
we just don't discuss.

465
00:36:25,262 --> 00:36:27,188
My daughter has a very healthy appetite.

466
00:36:27,213 --> 00:36:29,360
Interesting. You never mentioned
you had a daughter.

467
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:30,684
- What's her name?
- Emma.

468
00:36:30,732 --> 00:36:32,324
- How old is she?
- Seventeen.

469
00:36:32,362 --> 00:36:34,023
- Is she a cheerleader?
- I hope not.

470
00:36:34,058 --> 00:36:36,868
- What's her favorite band?
- You got me.

471
00:36:36,904 --> 00:36:38,303
How about her sign?

472
00:36:38,376 --> 00:36:40,071
Is she sexually active?

473
00:36:40,103 --> 00:36:41,934
- Hell, no.
- She probably is.

474
00:36:41,958 --> 00:36:44,580
68% of high-school students
in Texas have had sex...

475
00:36:44,614 --> 00:36:46,508
by the time they've reached the 12th
grade.

476
00:36:46,532 --> 00:36:48,742
Slightly higher than the national
average.

477
00:36:48,771 --> 00:36:50,204
Thank you for ruining my day.

478
00:36:50,242 --> 00:36:53,496
I'll tell you one thing about this
daughter you know nothing about.

479
00:36:53,537 --> 00:36:57,453
She must be supremely messed up in the
head from living in a house with you.

480
00:36:57,503 --> 00:36:59,130
She lives with her mother.

481
00:36:59,166 --> 00:37:00,690
Why did your marriage fall apart?

482
00:37:00,733 --> 00:37:03,260
That's one of many things
that you and I will never discuss.

483
00:37:03,292 --> 00:37:06,513
You see, you clearly don't know
how to speak to women.

484
00:37:06,555 --> 00:37:10,286
I know how to speak to women.
I clearly choose not to.

485
00:37:40,108 --> 00:37:42,824
We need to establish
this bathroom at the end of the hall...

486
00:37:42,859 --> 00:37:44,785
is a 100% masculine bathroom.

487
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:48,853
From this moment on, it is off-limits to
you people and your foolish
undergarments.

488
00:37:48,905 --> 00:37:51,495
- You want an egg-white omelet?
- Does that mean no yolks?

489
00:37:51,528 --> 00:37:52,961
- No yolks.
- No, thanks.

490
00:37:52,999 --> 00:37:54,762
- Want some kamut flakes?
- What?

491
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:58,089
- Ancient grain. Tastes great with
soymilk. - Soymilk.

492
00:38:01,091 --> 00:38:03,651
- Who ate all my kamut flakes?
- Not me.

493
00:38:04,994 --> 00:38:07,678
What am I,
the Organization to End World Hunger?

494
00:38:07,712 --> 00:38:10,044
This is my cereal.

495
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:14,655
Why do you girls find it necessary
to listen to this constant crap?

496
00:38:15,101 --> 00:38:16,762
You don't like vagina music?

497
00:38:16,796 --> 00:38:20,207
Do you have to use that word
before I've had my coffee and soymilk?

498
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:22,775
- Vagina.
- Whose?

499
00:38:23,257 --> 00:38:27,057
- What did I tell y'all about wearing
clothes? - Jog bras are clothes.

500
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:29,416
That's it.

501
00:38:31,062 --> 00:38:32,029
That is it.

502
00:39:00,873 --> 00:39:02,636
Just sign right there.

503
00:39:02,664 --> 00:39:05,411
- Awful big unit for a house this size.
- I get hot.

504
00:39:05,446 --> 00:39:06,811
I hear you.

505
00:39:30,108 --> 00:39:33,898
All right. You win, okay?
We all agree to put on more clothes.

506
00:39:33,946 --> 00:39:35,841
Now, can you please
turn the temperature up?

507
00:39:35,866 --> 00:39:38,456
That's a very mature decision
and I'm proud of you girls.

508
00:39:38,489 --> 00:39:40,541
But we should come
to a common understanding...

509
00:39:40,568 --> 00:39:43,594
the meaning, the definition
of the word "more."

510
00:39:44,213 --> 00:39:45,771
We thought you might say that.

511
00:39:45,813 --> 00:39:46,905
Barb!

512
00:39:48,915 --> 00:39:52,942
All righty.
This is Courtney Ryan, my personal hero.

513
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:57,280
Like Courtney, we feel we should not
be penalized for maximizing our assets.

514
00:39:57,328 --> 00:40:00,695
However, we've all agreed to cover up...

515
00:40:01,102 --> 00:40:02,831
these areas here...

516
00:40:03,182 --> 00:40:04,809
and this area right here.

517
00:40:04,845 --> 00:40:05,903
Good.

518
00:40:07,627 --> 00:40:10,061
But what about these other problem
areas?

519
00:40:10,922 --> 00:40:12,082
Here...

520
00:40:12,842 --> 00:40:14,002
here...

521
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,022
and here.

522
00:40:17,255 --> 00:40:18,882
You're killing me.

523
00:40:20,902 --> 00:40:22,199
Come here.

524
00:40:28,738 --> 00:40:31,044
All right. We'll cave on the first two.

525
00:40:31,074 --> 00:40:33,474
But we absolutely must maintain
navel visibility.

526
00:40:33,505 --> 00:40:35,556
We want to be realistic, not Amish.

527
00:40:35,582 --> 00:40:37,509
- One inch on either side.
- Three.

528
00:40:37,534 --> 00:40:38,899
- Two.
- Done.

529
00:40:49,753 --> 00:40:51,743
<i>These girls are a different kettle of
worms.</i>

530
00:40:51,769 --> 00:40:54,670
Something just came up. I'll get back to
you.

531
00:40:55,767 --> 00:40:58,167
I need to speak to your witnesses.

532
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:03,543
Eddie, how's the arm?

533
00:41:03,858 --> 00:41:05,553
Let's not change the subject.

534
00:41:05,586 --> 00:41:07,076
There are no witnesses.

535
00:41:07,121 --> 00:41:10,089
Even if there was, I couldn't let you
talk to them. You know that.

536
00:41:10,127 --> 00:41:12,812
Come on, Captain,
we're on the same team here.

537
00:41:12,847 --> 00:41:14,542
I think I can help.

538
00:41:14,767 --> 00:41:17,640
At least let me talk to Sharp.
That was him on the phone, right?

539
00:41:17,676 --> 00:41:19,974
Sharp's in the field right now.

540
00:41:20,427 --> 00:41:21,587
Right.

541
00:41:22,698 --> 00:41:25,258
Your Ranger screwed up my whole case.

542
00:41:25,385 --> 00:41:27,690
He blew up that lab
and all the evidence in it.

543
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,468
Ball is dead and I got shot in the arm,
for Christ's sake.

544
00:41:30,503 --> 00:41:35,065
I need to speak to those witnesses.
So I'm asking you again. Where are they?

545
00:41:40,451 --> 00:41:44,336
This "One Riot, One Ranger" shit won't
fly when I slap a subpoena on your desk.

546
00:41:44,385 --> 00:41:46,279
My desk's already a mess.

547
00:41:46,304 --> 00:41:49,603
One more piece of paper
won't make me no never mind.

548
00:41:51,423 --> 00:41:54,824
Circle the wagons if you want.
This is a federal case.

549
00:42:16,243 --> 00:42:18,832
- You learn quick.
- Five years of college.

550
00:42:18,865 --> 00:42:21,732
$13.75, right? Here's $14. Keep the
change.

551
00:42:29,741 --> 00:42:31,436
How's my favorite pep-squad leader?

552
00:42:31,468 --> 00:42:32,457
What?

553
00:42:32,524 --> 00:42:34,797
I said, how's my favorite pep-squad
leader?

554
00:42:34,827 --> 00:42:38,593
Not real peppy.
Would somebody turn that music down?

555
00:42:39,337 --> 00:42:40,463
Hang on, Cap.

556
00:42:40,521 --> 00:42:42,546
Is there any more pizza left?

557
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:49,186
Somebody, please turn that music off!

558
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:50,778
Throw this away.

559
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:58,502
I cannot hear myself think.

560
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:05,004
Okay, as we involuntarily enter
into this enforced period of silence...

561
00:43:05,054 --> 00:43:07,517
can I ask if there's any medication
you forgot to take...

562
00:43:07,548 --> 00:43:09,569
or some I might recommend you should
try?

563
00:43:09,595 --> 00:43:11,790
Yes. Like take a chill pill.

564
00:43:11,963 --> 00:43:13,658
I only need one witness.

565
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:14,884
Get out.

566
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:17,887
What's up, Cap?

567
00:43:17,944 --> 00:43:21,260
It's a subpoena from your buddy Zane.
The feds want our witnesses.

568
00:43:21,302 --> 00:43:23,480
<i>We're now officially in contempt.</i>

569
00:43:23,509 --> 00:43:27,332
Don't worry. If Cortland don't send
somebody to kill them soon, I'll do it
myself.

570
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:31,316
One other thing. I got this invoice here
for an air conditioner.

571
00:43:31,378 --> 00:43:35,547
$7,572.44.

572
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:36,760
Can you explain that to me?

573
00:43:36,815 --> 00:43:38,646
I'll have to get back to you on that
one.

574
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:40,228
Where do you think you're going?

575
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:42,575
To the Cactus Cafe.
Asleep at the Wheel's playing.

576
00:43:42,605 --> 00:43:45,511
Too many people. You know the rules.
Nobody goes out after dark.

577
00:43:45,548 --> 00:43:48,896
We're young, we're strong,
and we're tired of being cooped up.

578
00:43:48,938 --> 00:43:51,591
I haven't had phone sex with my
boyfriend in almost a week.

579
00:43:51,626 --> 00:43:52,854
I have oats to plow.

580
00:43:52,904 --> 00:43:54,989
You got oats to sow,
and it ain't gonna happen.

581
00:43:55,016 --> 00:43:59,310
Like hell it's not. What's to stop me from
walking out that door? The <i>Tontos</i>?

582
00:43:59,365 --> 00:44:01,094
I eat men like that for breakfast.

583
00:44:01,125 --> 00:44:04,720
And what, you? I'd like to see you try
it, Mr. Ranger-man.

584
00:44:06,754 --> 00:44:07,948
Come on.

585
00:44:22,395 --> 00:44:25,023
Anybody else wanna go see
Asleep at the Wheel?

586
00:44:28,281 --> 00:44:30,306
You think he needs backup?

587
00:44:31,288 --> 00:44:32,277
No.

588
00:44:33,143 --> 00:44:35,134
I think he can handle it.

589
00:44:46,257 --> 00:44:49,852
Let me guess, Clay.
You're looking for Jimmy.

590
00:44:51,534 --> 00:44:55,197
Totally. Dude, are you like a psychic
or some kind of shit?

591
00:44:55,853 --> 00:44:57,480
Some kind of shit.

592
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:59,047
The thing is...

593
00:44:59,307 --> 00:45:00,672
Jimmy moved.

594
00:45:00,971 --> 00:45:03,439
- Where to?
- Travis County Jailhouse.

595
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:05,759
That ain't good.

596
00:45:12,742 --> 00:45:17,008
Okay, a hairdo this phenomenal
only happens twice a year.

597
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:20,317
Please. It really needs to be shared
with the world.

598
00:45:20,354 --> 00:45:23,152
- What if we have to go to the bathroom?
- Go ahead.

599
00:45:23,264 --> 00:45:24,822
You're evil, you know that?

600
00:45:24,864 --> 00:45:27,138
Face it, girl. You're with me tonight.

601
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:28,862
We didn't ask for this.

602
00:45:28,894 --> 00:45:31,609
We just went into the bathroom
and saw a guy die.

603
00:45:31,644 --> 00:45:35,467
We could've kept quiet, but we didn't. I
feel like we're getting punished for it.

604
00:45:35,516 --> 00:45:38,768
- Sorry, but you're not being punished.
- Then let us out of here.

605
00:45:38,809 --> 00:45:42,040
Even prisoners on death row
get a little yard time.

606
00:45:42,264 --> 00:45:45,296
- How about the mall?
- Shopping with y'all? I don't think so.

607
00:45:45,335 --> 00:45:47,672
- What about a movie?
- Not in the mood.

608
00:45:47,702 --> 00:45:51,208
As captain of the cheerleading squad,
I demand that you take us someplace...

609
00:45:51,252 --> 00:45:54,415
where you can protect us
and we can have some fun.

610
00:46:20,743 --> 00:46:22,438
Look who's skating!

611
00:46:31,171 --> 00:46:34,518
Last time I was here, it was Emma's
sixth birthday. She loved this place.

612
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,323
You don't speak to her much, do you?

613
00:46:36,352 --> 00:46:38,149
I don't think Emma wants to talk to me.

614
00:46:38,176 --> 00:46:41,997
Every girl wants to talk to her dad. She
may act like she doesn't, but she does.

615
00:46:42,045 --> 00:46:45,709
Everything I say around her is wrong.
I've been wrong since she turned 11.

616
00:46:45,756 --> 00:46:48,630
Maybe you're just not asking her
the right questions.

617
00:46:48,667 --> 00:46:51,225
First of all, never ask, "So how's
school?"

618
00:46:51,258 --> 00:46:54,479
Nope. Dumb question. It's too easy.
Our brains just shut off.

619
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:58,374
And don't become her best friend.
We have enough friends, thank you.

620
00:46:58,423 --> 00:47:00,152
What do you wish you could say to her?

621
00:47:00,181 --> 00:47:02,265
That I wish I could see her more...

622
00:47:02,292 --> 00:47:05,356
and I'm sorry it didn't work out
between her mother and me...

623
00:47:05,396 --> 00:47:08,270
and it wasn't her fault, and stuff like
that.

624
00:47:08,306 --> 00:47:11,464
If my daddy told me them things,
I'd be the happiest girl alive.

625
00:47:11,505 --> 00:47:14,126
I haven't seen my dad
since he left me nine years ago.

626
00:47:14,159 --> 00:47:15,558
I'm sorry that happened to you.

627
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:18,188
You have a daughter and you love her.
You should tell her.

628
00:47:18,221 --> 00:47:21,443
Yeah, maybe you should take her
skating again, because you know what?

629
00:47:21,485 --> 00:47:23,578
You're getting pretty good.

630
00:47:24,011 --> 00:47:25,478
I am getting the hang of it.

631
00:47:25,515 --> 00:47:29,815
All right, we're going to let you go.
Show us your funky groove. Come on, boy!

632
00:47:31,273 --> 00:47:33,741
All right! Yes, sir!

633
00:47:38,181 --> 00:47:40,479
- Are you okay?
- That was bad.

634
00:47:47,586 --> 00:47:49,053
Morning, Emma.

635
00:47:49,216 --> 00:47:50,410
Mr. Zane?

636
00:47:50,464 --> 00:47:52,516
Look at you, you're all grown up.

637
00:47:52,543 --> 00:47:54,848
Yeah. Wow, it's been a long time.

638
00:47:54,877 --> 00:47:55,935
Sure has.

639
00:47:55,997 --> 00:47:57,157
What are you doing here?

640
00:47:57,213 --> 00:47:59,739
I'm looking for your father.
It's a professional matter.

641
00:47:59,772 --> 00:48:01,535
You got any idea where I might find him?

642
00:48:01,563 --> 00:48:03,995
No. He doesn't really tell me anything.

643
00:48:04,026 --> 00:48:05,721
What happened to your arm?

644
00:48:05,753 --> 00:48:08,449
It's just one of the hazards of the job.

645
00:48:08,792 --> 00:48:11,097
You wouldn't happen
to have a number on him, would you?

646
00:48:11,126 --> 00:48:12,218
Is he in trouble?

647
00:48:12,279 --> 00:48:15,405
No. It's just that I'm working on a case
and I need his help.

648
00:48:15,444 --> 00:48:17,275
If I need to get ahold of him...

649
00:48:17,299 --> 00:48:21,122
I usually call dispatch and they patch
me through on a restricted line.

650
00:48:21,171 --> 00:48:23,349
- I'll give that a try then.
- Okay.

651
00:48:23,377 --> 00:48:25,504
- Good to see you again.
- Bye.

652
00:48:29,902 --> 00:48:31,494
Sharp, look here.

653
00:48:32,173 --> 00:48:35,110
Remember that John Doe they pulled out
of a rest stop last week?

654
00:48:35,148 --> 00:48:38,022
Rifle from his trunk matches the bullet
they dug out of Swanson.

655
00:48:38,059 --> 00:48:40,755
Is this the fella y'all see shoot Morgan
Ball?

656
00:48:41,225 --> 00:48:44,036
No. The guy who shot Ball
seemed a lot nicer.

657
00:48:44,072 --> 00:48:45,630
And a lot less dead.

658
00:48:45,671 --> 00:48:48,008
- It was like Ball knew him or
something. - Knew him?

659
00:48:48,039 --> 00:48:51,671
Yeah. If you're through playing
detective, can you get us home so we can
rest?

660
00:48:51,717 --> 00:48:52,775
Nope.

661
00:48:52,964 --> 00:48:54,295
- Please?
- Come on.

662
00:48:54,468 --> 00:48:55,662
Load up.

663
00:49:13,563 --> 00:49:17,556
Yeah, I like that.
That's where we're gonna kill them.

664
00:49:18,745 --> 00:49:21,524
Remind me to take a collection
right after that.

665
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:24,181
That's gonna be a good time
to get the money.

666
00:49:24,215 --> 00:49:26,773
Well, if it ain't Martin Luther
Vandross.

667
00:49:26,806 --> 00:49:30,121
Why don't you all take a break.
Everybody go ahead, real quick.

668
00:49:30,163 --> 00:49:33,164
This man's probably got
a lot of sins he needs to confess.

669
00:49:33,202 --> 00:49:34,999
Probably may have to exorcise him.

670
00:49:35,026 --> 00:49:37,187
Y'all go about your business.

671
00:49:38,192 --> 00:49:40,150
Can't you see
I'm doing the Lord's business?

672
00:49:40,175 --> 00:49:41,802
You know this guy?

673
00:49:43,566 --> 00:49:45,363
I mean, that is...

674
00:49:45,389 --> 00:49:48,552
He got roughed up.
That is pretty bad right there.

675
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:50,771
- Is he dead?
- He way dead.

676
00:49:51,371 --> 00:49:54,704
Yeah, I mean, looks like a guy
that was in the can with me.

677
00:49:55,849 --> 00:49:57,612
Think his name's Jack Carter.

678
00:49:57,639 --> 00:49:58,867
He work for Cortland?

679
00:49:58,919 --> 00:50:01,541
No. He was more of a freelance artist...

680
00:50:01,574 --> 00:50:04,372
if you know what I'm saying.

681
00:50:05,828 --> 00:50:10,731
Looks like Cortland hired a second
shooter. Pull up Jack Carter, see what
we got on him.

682
00:50:12,065 --> 00:50:15,228
So, you girls are cheerleaders, huh?

683
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,860
Y'all recognize me? It's me, Percy.

684
00:50:20,925 --> 00:50:23,621
Yeah. Percy "Pirouette"...

685
00:50:24,444 --> 00:50:25,638
Stevens.

686
00:50:25,691 --> 00:50:28,990
Class of '89. I was bad. I was a bad
man.

687
00:50:29,562 --> 00:50:32,861
Y'all think that's funny? I'm good.
Okay.

688
00:50:33,048 --> 00:50:36,484
All right, you think that's funny?
You wait one second.

689
00:50:52,335 --> 00:50:55,557
"Ungawa, Texas got the power

690
00:50:55,598 --> 00:50:57,793
"I said, yes"

691
00:50:59,949 --> 00:51:03,612
Yeah, that was real fresh, Bobby Brown.

692
00:51:03,658 --> 00:51:04,920
Oh, yeah?

693
00:51:05,418 --> 00:51:07,281
Yeah, let me tell you something.

694
00:51:07,305 --> 00:51:09,398
Now, I may have missed the '90s...

695
00:51:09,448 --> 00:51:12,576
due to a previous engagement...

696
00:51:13,030 --> 00:51:15,430
but back in my day, we brought it.

697
00:51:15,589 --> 00:51:18,649
Oh, yeah. I'm talking real old school.

698
00:51:18,692 --> 00:51:21,786
Not like that little tired crap you trot
out to.

699
00:51:21,826 --> 00:51:25,057
A-G-G-I-E.

700
00:51:25,281 --> 00:51:26,908
What's that spell?

701
00:51:26,944 --> 00:51:28,571
What's that smell?

702
00:51:29,567 --> 00:51:30,761
Ladies.

703
00:51:32,063 --> 00:51:34,115
- All set?
- You bet.

704
00:51:34,141 --> 00:51:38,437
"More power, more power
more power to the hour

705
00:51:38,492 --> 00:51:42,092
"More bounce, more bounce
more bounce to the ounce"

706
00:51:42,138 --> 00:51:43,366
Boring.

707
00:51:44,025 --> 00:51:46,994
"Hot, now show us what you got"

708
00:52:40,224 --> 00:52:41,919
Now that's old school.

709
00:52:56,825 --> 00:52:57,792
<i>Hello?</i>

710
00:52:57,848 --> 00:52:58,815
- Hi, Emma, it's--
- <i>Psych!</i>

711
00:52:58,872 --> 00:53:01,238
<i>You got my machine. You know what to
do.</i>

712
00:53:02,775 --> 00:53:04,902
Hey, Emma, it's your father.

713
00:53:05,909 --> 00:53:06,967
Dad.

714
00:53:08,564 --> 00:53:10,489
I was just calling to see how you're
doing.

715
00:53:10,514 --> 00:53:14,211
It's kind of hard to reach me right now.
I'm working on a case.

716
00:53:15,857 --> 00:53:20,351
You know, like I'm always doing.
Just working on a case.

717
00:53:22,253 --> 00:53:26,485
Anyway, I'd like to talk to you.
So call me. You know how to reach me.

718
00:53:27,435 --> 00:53:31,303
If you feel like it. There's no pressure
or anything like that.

719
00:53:33,385 --> 00:53:34,613
You know.

720
00:53:37,895 --> 00:53:40,864
- So I guess that's it.
- Tell her you miss her.

721
00:53:41,669 --> 00:53:43,603
Except, I miss you, baby.

722
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:47,190
Can I help you?

723
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:49,354
Teresa had a visit from her little
friend.

724
00:53:49,378 --> 00:53:51,809
What did I tell you people about
visitors?

725
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:54,900
Not that kind of visitor. Her menses.

726
00:53:55,166 --> 00:53:58,136
- The curse of Eve. The crimson tide.
- I get it.

727
00:53:58,174 --> 00:54:01,769
So, someone has to go shopping.
Do you want me to go?

728
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:03,664
<i>Holt, get over here.</i>

729
00:54:03,707 --> 00:54:05,766
<i>I'm going out for some air.</i>

730
00:54:12,024 --> 00:54:16,723
<i>Attention.</i> <i>Price check on
register three, please.</i>

731
00:54:38,029 --> 00:54:39,963
Can't make up your mind?

732
00:54:40,556 --> 00:54:44,566
Do I need the slim fit, the regular
protection or the one with wings?

733
00:54:44,617 --> 00:54:47,711
The ones with the wings. Definitely.

734
00:54:51,142 --> 00:54:53,406
Cucumber-melon body spray.

735
00:54:53,701 --> 00:54:55,912
Vanilla-smoothie bikini cream.

736
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:58,246
Sounds like a busy and painful night
for your wife.

737
00:54:58,276 --> 00:55:00,005
I'm divorced. These are for the girls.

738
00:55:00,034 --> 00:55:03,162
The cheerleaders?
You do their shopping for them?

739
00:55:03,904 --> 00:55:06,463
You are a curious fella, Mr. Sharp. You
gay?

740
00:55:06,496 --> 00:55:08,987
No. Girls are all tied up, studying.

741
00:55:09,374 --> 00:55:11,932
I volunteered to help out
and pick up a few things.

742
00:55:11,965 --> 00:55:14,839
Are you sleeping with any
or possibly all of these girls?

743
00:55:14,876 --> 00:55:15,843
No.

744
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:17,629
Wanna have dinner with me
tomorrow night?

745
00:55:17,658 --> 00:55:18,920
Negative.

746
00:55:19,834 --> 00:55:22,962
- Negative? - It's not really possible,
with work and all.

747
00:55:23,769 --> 00:55:26,832
Well, okay, that plane just flew
into the side of the mountain.

748
00:55:26,871 --> 00:55:30,204
Call off the search, no survivors.
Have a pleasant evening.

749
00:55:46,030 --> 00:55:47,429
These yours?

750
00:55:49,709 --> 00:55:51,836
- Yes.
- You left them on the counter.

751
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:53,437
Thank you.

752
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:02,457
Thank you.

753
00:56:02,534 --> 00:56:04,745
I think I made a mistake back there.

754
00:56:04,774 --> 00:56:06,139
Didn't want the wings after all?

755
00:56:06,181 --> 00:56:08,928
No. In regard to dinner.
It's not that I don't want to.

756
00:56:08,964 --> 00:56:11,523
It's hard for me to get away
with my busy schedule...

757
00:56:11,555 --> 00:56:14,456
as an assistant cheerleading coach.

758
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:18,198
This whole cheerleading thing
must be a really tough racket.

759
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,832
You have no idea.

760
00:56:20,192 --> 00:56:21,523
Anyway, I was thinking...

761
00:56:21,567 --> 00:56:25,367
maybe you could come over to the house
tomorrow and I'll fix dinner.

762
00:56:30,427 --> 00:56:31,519
Okay.

763
00:56:33,336 --> 00:56:34,963
- 8:00?
- Yeah, good.

764
00:56:40,439 --> 00:56:42,703
By the way, I'm Molly.

765
00:56:42,997 --> 00:56:44,328
I'm Roland.

766
00:56:50,481 --> 00:56:54,383
You're not on the Zone or counting
points or anything like that, are you?

767
00:56:54,992 --> 00:56:55,981
No.

768
00:57:02,765 --> 00:57:04,630
Is that the North Star?

769
00:57:05,227 --> 00:57:09,596
No. I think that's an airplane.
You see the way it's moving?

770
00:57:10,729 --> 00:57:12,560
That's the North Star.

771
00:57:13,064 --> 00:57:15,430
So that's where they've been keeping it.

772
00:57:16,486 --> 00:57:19,044
Someday I want to do more
than look at the stars.

773
00:57:19,077 --> 00:57:21,272
I'm fixing to soar with them.

774
00:57:21,476 --> 00:57:24,098
What, you mean,
like an astronaut or something?

775
00:57:24,131 --> 00:57:27,532
No, not exactly. Not a living one, at
least.

776
00:57:27,905 --> 00:57:30,211
They got this company out of Beaumont...

777
00:57:30,241 --> 00:57:33,051
and they will launch your remains
right out into outer space.

778
00:57:33,087 --> 00:57:35,282
Really? I love shit like that.

779
00:57:35,358 --> 00:57:37,727
- But how?
- What they do is they park you--

780
00:57:37,757 --> 00:57:40,157
Holt, what the hell are you doing?

781
00:57:41,755 --> 00:57:44,815
Contemplating the vastness
of the universe, sir.

782
00:57:54,613 --> 00:57:58,814
It's supposed to be red.
Does this look like red to you?

783
00:57:58,868 --> 00:58:01,701
Just shoot her, Sharp.
You'd be doing her a favor.

784
00:58:02,099 --> 00:58:04,499
- Where are Teresa and Anne?
- I don't know.

785
00:58:04,529 --> 00:58:05,962
You're lying.

786
00:58:06,384 --> 00:58:08,500
- How do you know?
- You broke eye contact.

787
00:58:08,528 --> 00:58:10,959
It's a sign of stress and possible
deception.

788
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:13,675
So is picking at your clothes.
Stop picking at your clothes.

789
00:58:13,709 --> 00:58:15,887
Look me in the eye
and tell me where they're at.

790
00:58:15,916 --> 00:58:17,905
Teresa and Antonio had a really big
fight.

791
00:58:17,930 --> 00:58:21,559
She had to blow off some steam,
so they went to the Buffalo Billiards.

792
00:58:22,922 --> 00:58:24,048
You stay here.

793
00:58:24,104 --> 00:58:26,902
Don't be contemplating the universe
with anybody.

794
00:58:40,129 --> 00:58:43,030
Look, a native approaches.
Avoid eye contact.

795
00:58:47,711 --> 00:58:50,679
You guys are the cheerleaders, right?
The ones with the calendar?

796
00:58:50,717 --> 00:58:51,775
Nope.

797
00:58:51,932 --> 00:58:54,924
Could have sworn you were June.
June kicks ass.

798
00:58:55,002 --> 00:58:56,663
Sorry, wrong girl.

799
00:58:56,698 --> 00:59:01,192
Well, me and my buddies over there,
we go to every game.

800
00:59:01,368 --> 00:59:02,699
Have you seen us?

801
00:59:02,744 --> 00:59:04,609
Yeah.

802
00:59:04,759 --> 00:59:07,091
I thought I recognized you guys.

803
00:59:07,189 --> 00:59:11,043
You guys were the ones getting really
drunk going, "woo, woo," right?

804
00:59:11,092 --> 00:59:13,219
- You saw us.
- No.

805
00:59:14,002 --> 00:59:15,897
Your school spirit sucks.

806
00:59:15,922 --> 00:59:19,364
I'm captain of the cheer squad.
Our school spirit kicks ass.

807
00:59:19,408 --> 00:59:23,262
Yeah, and it's getting hit on
by idiots like you that really sucks.

808
00:59:23,311 --> 00:59:25,711
You're a sassy bitch. I like that.

809
00:59:26,893 --> 00:59:29,088
- Get your hands--
- Hang on now.

810
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:32,868
Everybody cool off.
We've had enough fun tonight.

811
00:59:35,113 --> 00:59:36,546
Now I've had enough fun.

812
00:59:36,584 --> 00:59:40,645
Was that completely necessary? You could
seriously injure a young man by doing
that.

813
00:59:49,955 --> 00:59:51,582
I should warn you.

814
00:59:52,098 --> 00:59:53,565
I know karate.

815
00:59:53,729 --> 00:59:55,754
You better know something.

816
00:59:57,951 --> 01:00:00,784
Any of the rest of you boys here
wanna play the winner?

817
01:00:11,225 --> 01:00:13,246
We had the situation under control.

818
01:00:13,273 --> 01:00:16,868
Yeah. We were about to go all Buffy
on their gringo asses.

819
01:00:28,818 --> 01:00:30,410
I brought you a pillow.

820
01:00:30,450 --> 01:00:32,628
It's better than the ones you've been
using.

821
01:00:32,656 --> 01:00:35,716
Buckwheat hulls. It's good for neck
support.

822
01:00:36,111 --> 01:00:37,408
Thank you.

823
01:00:38,830 --> 01:00:41,594
That was cool what you did for the
girls.

824
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:43,905
It was cool.

825
01:00:45,610 --> 01:00:47,441
That's one big honking bullet.

826
01:00:47,466 --> 01:00:49,802
You fixing to send a monkey up
in that thing?

827
01:00:49,832 --> 01:00:52,699
That thing
is a personnel suppressor deluxe.

828
01:00:53,031 --> 01:00:56,057
Personnel suppressor? You mean killing?

829
01:00:56,613 --> 01:00:59,961
Can't you just wound them or something?
Shoot the gun out of their hand?

830
01:01:00,003 --> 01:01:01,732
No, it's impossible.

831
01:01:05,218 --> 01:01:07,871
You're not really the cheerleading type,
are you?

832
01:01:07,905 --> 01:01:10,273
For me, it's more penance than a
passion.

833
01:01:10,303 --> 01:01:13,534
Religious ascetics wear a hair shirt,
I carry the pom-poms.

834
01:01:14,014 --> 01:01:15,447
I don't know.

835
01:01:16,189 --> 01:01:18,987
I guess it's the duality of man, you
know?

836
01:01:19,228 --> 01:01:21,253
"That Jungian thing, sir."

837
01:01:21,530 --> 01:01:23,393
Matthew Modine, <i>Full Metal Jacket</i>.

838
01:01:23,418 --> 01:01:26,261
Peace sign on one side of his helmet,
"Born to Kill" on the other.

839
01:01:26,297 --> 01:01:27,764
It's my favorite movie.

840
01:01:30,614 --> 01:01:33,310
My favorite movie is <i>The Sound of
Music</i>.

841
01:01:39,698 --> 01:01:41,290
"What's in a name?

842
01:01:41,617 --> 01:01:45,781
"that which we call a rose
By any other name would smell as sweet"

843
01:01:46,256 --> 01:01:47,848
I don't understand any of this.

844
01:01:47,887 --> 01:01:51,424
Pretty simple, really.
She's a Capulet, he's a Montague.

845
01:01:51,469 --> 01:01:55,701
The two families have always hated each
other and they always will hate each
other.

846
01:01:55,915 --> 01:01:59,168
- Why couldn't Shakespeare say it like
that? - He could have.

847
01:01:59,210 --> 01:02:02,210
But nobody would be talking about it
410 years later.

848
01:02:02,248 --> 01:02:04,301
How do you know so much
about <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>?

849
01:02:04,328 --> 01:02:05,454
I read the play.

850
01:02:05,510 --> 01:02:08,542
- Why would you read the play? - Molly's
coming over for dinner tonight.

851
01:02:08,581 --> 01:02:09,809
Who's Molly?

852
01:02:09,861 --> 01:02:11,419
Professor McCarthy.

853
01:02:11,460 --> 01:02:12,859
You call her Molly?

854
01:02:12,899 --> 01:02:15,931
This whole house totally reeks.
What is that smell?

855
01:02:15,970 --> 01:02:18,768
Five Alarm Chili. It's my specialty.

856
01:02:19,201 --> 01:02:21,692
You're putting meat into my lentil pot?

857
01:02:21,919 --> 01:02:23,580
He's making dinner for Molly.

858
01:02:23,615 --> 01:02:24,980
Who's Molly?

859
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:27,265
Professor McCarthy, Intro to English
Lit.

860
01:02:27,293 --> 01:02:30,704
I had her last quarter. She's a babe.
And this is what you're serving her?

861
01:02:30,748 --> 01:02:32,215
It's his specialty.

862
01:02:32,251 --> 01:02:33,616
My wife loved my chili.

863
01:02:33,659 --> 01:02:36,059
Your wife left your gassy old ass.

864
01:02:36,090 --> 01:02:38,650
- What's going on?
- Sharp's got a date.

865
01:02:44,341 --> 01:02:45,865
- What are you gonna wear?
- Clothes.

866
01:02:45,909 --> 01:02:48,025
- Pants, sport coat.
- Not that butt-ugly thing.

867
01:02:48,052 --> 01:02:49,076
I like that sport coat.

868
01:02:49,139 --> 01:02:50,436
I grabbed everything I could find.

869
01:02:50,484 --> 01:02:52,789
What comes first,
astringent or exfoliating lotion?

870
01:02:52,819 --> 01:02:54,047
I don't use that stuff.

871
01:02:54,097 --> 01:02:56,119
You've got pores
the size of manhole covers.

872
01:02:56,145 --> 01:03:00,124
And the ears, the nose. We better do
something about all this hair.

873
01:03:00,175 --> 01:03:02,228
You can use some bronzer.
You need some color.

874
01:03:02,255 --> 01:03:04,970
- I don't bronze.
- You'll bronze, white boy.

875
01:03:05,004 --> 01:03:08,668
I have been successfully grooming myself
for longer than y'all have been alive.

876
01:03:08,715 --> 01:03:10,704
Some things have changed
since you were young.

877
01:03:10,730 --> 01:03:13,225
We've discovered fire and the wheel.

878
01:03:13,257 --> 01:03:16,036
She's right. If you wanna get over,
you better listen to us.

879
01:03:16,072 --> 01:03:17,300
I'm just having dinner.

880
01:03:17,351 --> 01:03:20,699
Not looking like that you won't.
Barb, can you do anything with the hair?

881
01:03:20,742 --> 01:03:22,073
Shave it all off.

882
01:03:22,117 --> 01:03:23,641
Go talk to her. Give me that.

883
01:03:27,171 --> 01:03:31,246
Come on. I mean, it's never gonna work
out between you and Sharp.

884
01:03:31,298 --> 01:03:33,459
He's old enough to be your...

885
01:03:33,792 --> 01:03:37,728
great-great-great-great grandfather.

886
01:03:38,206 --> 01:03:42,302
And you have an opportunity to help him.
You went to beauty school.

887
01:03:42,716 --> 01:03:44,183
I flunked out.

888
01:03:44,604 --> 01:03:45,764
I know.

889
01:03:46,586 --> 01:03:47,883
But he doesn't know that.

890
01:04:02,675 --> 01:04:04,855
"Natural-looking dramatic highlights...

891
01:04:04,883 --> 01:04:07,820
"that enhance and brighten
your natural hair color."

892
01:04:07,858 --> 01:04:09,086
- Yes.
- No.

893
01:04:20,108 --> 01:04:23,740
Okay, let's focus on the conversation.
How are you gonna get things rolling?

894
01:04:23,786 --> 01:04:24,775
I don't know.

895
01:04:24,841 --> 01:04:27,084
It's been a long time
since I went out on a date.

896
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:30,276
That's okay.
Look, just give us a little preview.

897
01:04:31,462 --> 01:04:32,656
I'm her.

898
01:04:32,807 --> 01:04:34,104
I come in.

899
01:04:34,469 --> 01:04:35,458
Go.

900
01:04:35,525 --> 01:04:37,862
Well, I'll start out by saying "hello."

901
01:04:37,892 --> 01:04:39,484
No, I'll say "hi."

902
01:04:40,643 --> 01:04:42,758
No, "hello" is better. I think.

903
01:04:42,786 --> 01:04:44,744
I'll wait and see how I feel at the
time.

904
01:04:44,769 --> 01:04:47,329
Then I'll probably start out saying...

905
01:04:47,904 --> 01:04:49,929
Asking her if she ever...

906
01:04:54,429 --> 01:04:56,590
We'll start talking about...

907
01:04:59,483 --> 01:05:01,474
I'm in deep shit, ain't I?

908
01:05:06,007 --> 01:05:07,531
Who knew you were such a babe?

909
01:05:07,575 --> 01:05:09,406
Even if you didn't let us frost your
tips.

910
01:05:09,430 --> 01:05:11,125
You clean up pretty nice, Sergeant.

911
01:05:11,157 --> 01:05:13,716
- You're all that and then some.
- Thank you.

912
01:05:13,749 --> 01:05:16,275
Remember, a woman is like a horse.

913
01:05:16,307 --> 01:05:19,370
She likes the guy on the saddle
to have a tight grip on the reins.

914
01:05:19,409 --> 01:05:22,742
Excuse me, a woman is not a horse.
Just be yourself.

915
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:25,579
I'm not so sure being himself
is going in the right direction.

916
01:05:25,615 --> 01:05:29,247
Okay. Just be yourself,
but not the you who you really are.

917
01:05:29,293 --> 01:05:32,073
Be the you who you would be
if you were somebody else.

918
01:05:32,108 --> 01:05:34,855
- Somebody better.
- That's what I mean. Somebody better.

919
01:05:34,891 --> 01:05:36,754
- Maybe we ought to call this off.
- Okay.

920
01:05:36,778 --> 01:05:37,745
No!

921
01:05:38,281 --> 01:05:41,028
It's too late.
Okay, just don't be the schizoid Sharp.

922
01:05:41,064 --> 01:05:43,328
Be the Sharp who embraces life.

923
01:05:48,229 --> 01:05:51,482
Now, don't worry.
We'll be with you every step of the way.

924
01:05:51,523 --> 01:05:55,220
Sgt. Holt provided us
with a spare set of eyes and ears.

925
01:05:55,938 --> 01:05:57,496
Can you hear me?

926
01:05:57,857 --> 01:05:59,586
Can you hear me now?

927
01:06:00,703 --> 01:06:02,671
- Out of here!
- Sorry.

928
01:06:04,350 --> 01:06:06,443
Just take these.

929
01:06:10,843 --> 01:06:11,867
Get!

930
01:06:18,456 --> 01:06:19,616
Hello.

931
01:06:19,927 --> 01:06:21,121
Come in.

932
01:06:32,721 --> 01:06:34,655
Tell her she looks nice.

933
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:37,867
You look nice.

934
01:06:38,031 --> 01:06:40,499
Thank you. So do you.

935
01:06:40,782 --> 01:06:42,215
Nifty jacket.

936
01:06:44,140 --> 01:06:45,664
Give her the flowers.

937
01:06:45,707 --> 01:06:47,334
Girls thought you might like those.

938
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:48,860
No, they were your idea.

939
01:06:48,906 --> 01:06:52,774
They're my idea, but the girls thought
you might like those.

940
01:06:53,832 --> 01:06:55,663
Well, they were right.

941
01:06:56,583 --> 01:06:58,380
- They're not here, are they?
- No.

942
01:06:58,406 --> 01:07:00,521
Good. That would have been
a little awkward.

943
01:07:00,549 --> 01:07:02,176
<i>Yes. Real awkward.</i>

944
01:07:03,268 --> 01:07:04,735
Take the wine.

945
01:07:05,188 --> 01:07:06,382
<i>Take it.</i>

946
01:07:06,690 --> 01:07:08,555
I'll just go open this.

947
01:07:18,206 --> 01:07:19,798
Where do you keep the corkscrew?

948
01:07:19,837 --> 01:07:21,998
Left of the sink, top drawer.

949
01:07:33,430 --> 01:07:34,522
Look.

950
01:07:34,806 --> 01:07:37,743
Base to Ranger One, we've got
a makeup check in the dining room.

951
01:07:37,781 --> 01:07:40,813
- <i>I repeat, makeup check in the dining
room.</i> - What does that mean?

952
01:07:40,851 --> 01:07:43,820
It means she digs you, man.
Now, loosen the hell up.

953
01:07:52,815 --> 01:07:54,112
Thank you.

954
01:07:55,148 --> 01:07:56,137
Root beer.

955
01:07:56,204 --> 01:07:58,415
I gave up alcohol about 10 years ago.

956
01:07:58,444 --> 01:08:00,654
Didn't like yourself
when you were drinking, huh?

957
01:08:00,682 --> 01:08:04,482
Hell, I loved myself when I drank. It
was other people that had the problem.

958
01:08:06,344 --> 01:08:07,333
He's a dork.

959
01:08:12,165 --> 01:08:14,929
Well, why don't I put these in some
water.

960
01:08:16,644 --> 01:08:20,876
All right, look, you got a laugh. Now go
to the table and light the candles.

961
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:23,204
No, that's such a lame move.

962
01:08:23,233 --> 01:08:24,962
<i>Candles are a total cliché.</i>

963
01:08:24,992 --> 01:08:27,392
<i>What do you know about clichés?</i>
<i>You've got a waterbed.</i>

964
01:08:27,422 --> 01:08:29,633
I say, light the candle. It's sexy.

965
01:08:29,662 --> 01:08:33,736
<i>He might as well pull out the bearskin
rug</i> <i>and the disco ball, for God's
sake.</i>

966
01:08:33,788 --> 01:08:35,221
I need confirmation.

967
01:08:35,259 --> 01:08:38,386
<i>Is lighting the candle</i>
<i>a cool move or not a cool move?</i>

968
01:08:38,426 --> 01:08:39,484
Fine.

969
01:08:40,313 --> 01:08:41,712
All in favor of candles?

970
01:08:41,753 --> 01:08:43,721
- Me.
- Opposed?

971
01:08:45,271 --> 01:08:48,240
Mission Control to Sharp.
Light those candles.

972
01:08:55,475 --> 01:08:56,908
<i>I don't know.</i>

973
01:08:57,107 --> 01:09:01,771
<i>So many of my colleagues just stick it
out</i> <i>for the paycheck and the
benefits.</i>

974
01:09:02,191 --> 01:09:04,433
Or, in my ex-husband's case...

975
01:09:04,462 --> 01:09:07,761
for the endless supply
of fresh, young coeds.

976
01:09:07,917 --> 01:09:11,512
Why would a man want to be with a girl
when he can be with a woman?

977
01:09:11,915 --> 01:09:14,975
Or in your case, with five girls.

978
01:09:16,201 --> 01:09:17,896
What is your story?

979
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:20,659
My work became my mistress.

980
01:09:21,575 --> 01:09:24,135
Before I knew it, that was all I had.

981
01:09:43,518 --> 01:09:44,985
Willie Nelson.

982
01:09:48,412 --> 01:09:50,312
Man after my own heart.

983
01:09:52,185 --> 01:09:53,812
You want to dance?

984
01:10:06,739 --> 01:10:09,037
So, what's really going on here?

985
01:10:13,072 --> 01:10:14,266
Dancing.

986
01:10:16,527 --> 01:10:18,518
No, I mean here.

987
01:10:19,726 --> 01:10:22,627
What is a man like you doing in this
house?

988
01:10:24,299 --> 01:10:25,766
Well, it's...

989
01:10:27,082 --> 01:10:28,947
a temporary assignment.

990
01:10:31,336 --> 01:10:35,632
And I venture to guess it has nothing
to do with cheerleading, does it?

991
01:10:35,687 --> 01:10:37,120
Not much, no.

992
01:10:38,501 --> 01:10:40,469
It's kind of complicated.

993
01:10:45,634 --> 01:10:47,329
You want to go in the living room?

994
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:51,778
Yeah.

995
01:10:56,317 --> 01:10:58,877
Gross. What are you gonna do,
bag her on the couch?

996
01:11:09,847 --> 01:11:12,475
<i>Good night, Barb. Do your homework.</i>

997
01:11:13,718 --> 01:11:15,447
I can still see you.

998
01:11:19,955 --> 01:11:21,582
You're killing me.

999
01:11:40,362 --> 01:11:41,488
<i>Hello?</i>

1000
01:11:41,897 --> 01:11:45,355
Hi, I'm returning a call
from somebody named Evie.

1001
01:11:45,447 --> 01:11:47,745
<i>That's me. Is this Emma?</i>

1002
01:11:47,879 --> 01:11:50,437
Yeah. I'm sorry, do I know you?

1003
01:11:50,470 --> 01:11:52,563
No. But I know your dad.

1004
01:11:52,868 --> 01:11:55,462
I got your number from his cellphone.

1005
01:11:55,555 --> 01:11:58,808
I hope you don't mind,
but I'm doing this psych paper...

1006
01:11:58,850 --> 01:12:01,444
and I was wondering
if I could ask you some questions.

1007
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:04,043
- <i>Yeah, okay.</i>
- <i>Great.</i>

1008
01:12:04,511 --> 01:12:06,274
<i>I have this Hex Rally tomorrow
night...</i>

1009
01:12:06,302 --> 01:12:09,465
<i>but I was wondering</i>
<i>if we can get started tonight.</i>

1010
01:12:21,303 --> 01:12:23,271
Five, six, seven, eight.

1011
01:12:36,242 --> 01:12:38,403
- This is--
- Terrible, I know.

1012
01:12:38,544 --> 01:12:40,307
I was gonna say good.

1013
01:12:40,624 --> 01:12:42,717
I'm proud of you. It's good.

1014
01:12:43,950 --> 01:12:46,256
- What are y'all doing?
- Getting pumped for Hex Rally.

1015
01:12:46,285 --> 01:12:48,082
- We'll have to nix the Hex Rally.
- What?

1016
01:12:48,109 --> 01:12:51,171
No. There's no nixing the Hex.
It must go on.

1017
01:12:51,210 --> 01:12:53,263
You can't stop the Hex, Mr. Ranger-man.

1018
01:12:53,290 --> 01:12:55,248
- It's bigger than all of us.
- Is that right?

1019
01:12:55,273 --> 01:13:00,108
If we were doctors, we'd cure cancer. If
we were nurses, we'd give people shots.

1020
01:13:00,231 --> 01:13:04,116
If we were astronauts,
we would do other things.

1021
01:13:04,165 --> 01:13:08,397
But we're not. We're cheerleaders.
And we're going to the Hex Rally.

1022
01:13:08,707 --> 01:13:11,138
- You don't respect cheerleading, do
you? - No.

1023
01:13:11,170 --> 01:13:13,191
That's because you still don't get it.

1024
01:13:13,217 --> 01:13:15,902
Samuel L. Jackson, Sandra Bullock,
Cameron Diaz...

1025
01:13:15,936 --> 01:13:18,273
Calista Flockhart, Madonna and Halle
Berry.

1026
01:13:18,303 --> 01:13:22,345
Not to mention Franklin D. Roosevelt,
Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush...

1027
01:13:22,397 --> 01:13:25,082
and the governor of our fair state,
Rick Perry.

1028
01:13:25,116 --> 01:13:26,242
All cheerleaders.

1029
01:13:26,299 --> 01:13:30,311
See, you're a negative person, Sharp.
Cheerleading is all about the positive.

1030
01:13:30,362 --> 01:13:34,152
Our job is to inspire, support and
electrify.

1031
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:36,031
Any fool can feel good
when you're winning.

1032
01:13:36,055 --> 01:13:38,550
But when you're down 27 points
in the fourth quarter...

1033
01:13:38,582 --> 01:13:41,176
that's when you got to ask yourself,
"Who you gonna call?"

1034
01:13:45,811 --> 01:13:47,779
I might call Halle Berry.

1035
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:32,450
<i>Hey, Longhorns.</i> <i>Are we ready to
take A&M to the mat?</i>

1036
01:14:34,940 --> 01:14:37,534
<i>I don't think these guys can hear
you.</i>

1037
01:14:39,738 --> 01:14:43,181
<i>All right, well, now that we've put the
hex</i> <i>on those Aggies...</i>

1038
01:14:43,225 --> 01:14:45,467
<i>I want y'all to raise your flames up
high...</i>

1039
01:14:45,496 --> 01:14:47,991
<i>for someone who knows</i>
<i>a thing or two about spirit.</i>

1040
01:14:48,023 --> 01:14:52,426
<i>I am talking about</i> <i>Assistant
Cheer Coach Roland Sharp.</i>

1041
01:14:56,307 --> 01:14:57,831
What am I supposed to do with this?

1042
01:14:57,874 --> 01:15:00,240
Inspire and electrify. Go!

1043
01:15:02,576 --> 01:15:03,873
<i>All right.</i>

1044
01:15:03,984 --> 01:15:05,212
Bring it.

1045
01:15:06,703 --> 01:15:09,570
<i>This torch right here represents...</i>

1046
01:15:09,838 --> 01:15:12,207
<i>the spirit burning deep within the
heart...</i>

1047
01:15:12,237 --> 01:15:15,400
<i>of each and every Longhorn</i>
<i>that never can be extinguished.</i>

1048
01:15:24,967 --> 01:15:26,298
<i>All right.</i>

1049
01:15:26,949 --> 01:15:29,318
<i>All right, you're all here
because...</i>

1050
01:15:29,349 --> 01:15:32,477
<i>you want to see your Longhorns</i>
<i>emerge victorious.</i>

1051
01:15:32,676 --> 01:15:35,804
<i>You want to see them</i>
<i>dominate the football field...</i>

1052
01:15:36,194 --> 01:15:38,924
<i>and win the football game.</i>

1053
01:15:41,503 --> 01:15:44,978
<i>Well, then it's up to each</i>
<i>and every one of us to help them.</i>

1054
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:46,957
<i>We got to raise them up.</i>

1055
01:15:47,134 --> 01:15:49,227
<i>We got to hoist them high...</i>

1056
01:15:49,596 --> 01:15:52,326
<i>to put them on a platform of
positivity.</i>

1057
01:15:53,563 --> 01:15:55,710
<i>Any fool can feel good</i>
<i>when you're winning.</i>

1058
01:15:55,737 --> 01:15:58,453
<i>But when you're down 27 points</i>
<i>in the fourth quarter...</i>

1059
01:15:58,488 --> 01:16:01,753
<i>you got to ask yourself,</i>
<i>"Who you gonna call?"</i>

1060
01:16:01,814 --> 01:16:05,731
<i>I tell you who I'm going to call,</i>
<i>and that's these ladies right here.</i>

1061
01:16:05,781 --> 01:16:08,718
<i>They're the most spirited group</i>
<i>of young ladies I've ever seen...</i>

1062
01:16:08,756 --> 01:16:12,830
<i>or had a chance to get to know and</i>
<i>had the privilege of coming in
contact with.</i>

1063
01:16:12,881 --> 01:16:15,577
<i>Praise the Lord and pass the
ammunition!</i>

1064
01:16:32,617 --> 01:16:35,965
Okay, now can I get a witness?
This man has got the spirit.

1065
01:16:36,008 --> 01:16:38,913
Swear to God, I thought
he was gonna start speaking in tongues.

1066
01:16:38,950 --> 01:16:41,161
What about "platform of positivity"?

1067
01:16:41,190 --> 01:16:44,956
I was gonna do a cartwheel,
but didn't want to steal the limelight.

1068
01:16:46,850 --> 01:16:48,442
I think Sharp just made a joke.

1069
01:16:48,482 --> 01:16:51,071
It's more of a jape or a jest,
but still, it's progress.

1070
01:16:51,105 --> 01:16:53,471
- Can we go to the party?
- <i>Negativo</i>, baby.

1071
01:16:54,368 --> 01:16:58,189
Please. When are you guys
gonna get over yourselves?

1072
01:16:58,237 --> 01:17:01,263
Nobody, I repeat, nobody is trying to
kill us.

1073
01:17:06,586 --> 01:17:08,850
Get out of this van, right now! Let's
go.

1074
01:17:08,985 --> 01:17:10,179
Come on.

1075
01:17:10,521 --> 01:17:13,012
This thing is not working.

1076
01:17:13,367 --> 01:17:15,164
- I'm stuck.
- Let's go!

1077
01:17:15,190 --> 01:17:17,249
I'm stuck! I can't get out!

1078
01:17:19,093 --> 01:17:20,321
Get down!

1079
01:17:35,501 --> 01:17:38,334
Okay, maybe somebody is trying to kill
us.

1080
01:17:41,290 --> 01:17:43,417
How did they, like, find us?

1081
01:17:43,466 --> 01:17:45,161
They looked for us.

1082
01:17:45,897 --> 01:17:48,266
- What about Emma?
- She doesn't know where I am.

1083
01:17:48,296 --> 01:17:52,062
Yes, sir, she does. She called last
night on the house phone.

1084
01:17:53,317 --> 01:17:55,308
She was returning my call.

1085
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:57,155
Was that a mistake?

1086
01:18:00,290 --> 01:18:01,723
Get them upstairs.

1087
01:18:01,794 --> 01:18:03,421
Come on, let's go.

1088
01:18:04,832 --> 01:18:06,299
Come on, move.

1089
01:18:12,477 --> 01:18:13,466
Hello?

1090
01:18:13,533 --> 01:18:15,617
- Where you at?
- I'm at home.

1091
01:18:15,644 --> 01:18:16,804
Where's your mother?

1092
01:18:16,891 --> 01:18:19,954
Dad, I told you. She and Keith
went to Cancún for a couple of days.

1093
01:18:19,993 --> 01:18:21,426
<i>You don't have to check up on me.</i>

1094
01:18:21,465 --> 01:18:24,118
Your friend from the FBI is here.
He told me everything.

1095
01:18:24,152 --> 01:18:25,847
Let me talk to him.

1096
01:18:27,255 --> 01:18:29,223
He wants to talk to you.

1097
01:18:30,229 --> 01:18:32,281
Hey, Sharp. How are your witnesses
doing?

1098
01:18:32,308 --> 01:18:33,332
Everyone safe?

1099
01:18:33,396 --> 01:18:35,258
You're making a big mistake.

1100
01:18:35,282 --> 01:18:39,199
Good. I was just telling Emma that a
desperate guy is trying to cover a
crime...

1101
01:18:39,249 --> 01:18:42,439
and if he couldn't get to you,
he might come looking for her.

1102
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:45,608
Don't worry.
I'm here now, and everything's cool.

1103
01:18:47,309 --> 01:18:48,833
Emma doll, is there any more coffee?

1104
01:18:48,877 --> 01:18:50,970
- Sure, Mr. Zane.
- Thank you.

1105
01:18:56,266 --> 01:18:57,927
<i>I'm a dead man, Sharp.</i>

1106
01:18:57,960 --> 01:18:59,757
<i>I don't care about your witnesses
anymore.</i>

1107
01:18:59,784 --> 01:19:02,912
<i>All I want is the money</i>
<i>Ball stole from Cortland.</i>

1108
01:19:03,559 --> 01:19:07,154
<i>All right, the night you arrested
Ball,</i> <i>you took a key from him.</i>

1109
01:19:07,429 --> 01:19:08,453
Yeah.

1110
01:19:08,549 --> 01:19:10,696
Good. Here's what you're gonna do.

1111
01:19:10,723 --> 01:19:13,881
<i>You go to the bank,</i> <i>take the
money out of the safe deposit box...</i>

1112
01:19:13,922 --> 01:19:17,153
<i>put the money in a duffle bag,</i>
<i>get in your truck...</i>

1113
01:19:17,345 --> 01:19:20,781
<i>and meet me in Eagle Pass</i>
<i>near the border at 2:00 p.m.</i>

1114
01:19:20,991 --> 01:19:23,892
<i>Only you, Sharp. No one else.</i>

1115
01:19:54,448 --> 01:19:58,407
Put your keys in the bag
and get out of the truck with the money.

1116
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:09,637
Bag on the ground.

1117
01:20:10,921 --> 01:20:13,014
Put your weapon in the bag.

1118
01:20:15,687 --> 01:20:19,067
Put your cellphone in the bag,
get back in the truck...

1119
01:20:19,110 --> 01:20:21,636
and handcuff yourself to the steering
wheel.

1120
01:20:21,668 --> 01:20:25,627
Don't try any tricks, Sharp.
I will shoot her right here and now.

1121
01:20:56,437 --> 01:20:58,426
Thanks, Roland. You're a good parent.

1122
01:20:58,452 --> 01:21:00,215
<i>Please board immediately.</i>

1123
01:21:02,003 --> 01:21:03,866
<i>This is the last announcement...</i>

1124
01:21:03,890 --> 01:21:07,986
<i>for the bus leaving</i>
<i>for Laredo, Nuevo Laredo...</i>

1125
01:21:13,581 --> 01:21:15,048
What the hell?

1126
01:21:19,595 --> 01:21:22,058
- What are y'all doing here?
- Barb's got a plan.

1127
01:21:22,090 --> 01:21:23,648
Barb has a plan?

1128
01:21:24,904 --> 01:21:26,269
You know what you're doing?

1129
01:21:26,312 --> 01:21:28,870
I spent a year in juvenile detention
for stealing cars.

1130
01:21:28,903 --> 01:21:31,133
It was an educational experience.

1131
01:21:38,019 --> 01:21:40,579
- How'd y'all get here?
- Brand-new car.

1132
01:22:20,976 --> 01:22:23,604
I think I'm having the baby.

1133
01:22:27,021 --> 01:22:28,215
I can't.

1134
01:22:28,588 --> 01:22:31,620
Evie, get it together.
I know you can do it. Just breathe.

1135
01:22:31,659 --> 01:22:33,593
Come on. Breathe. Ready?

1136
01:22:39,368 --> 01:22:42,428
Driver, stop the bus!
My friend's having a baby!

1137
01:22:49,219 --> 01:22:50,413
I did it!

1138
01:22:58,847 --> 01:23:03,307
I have to get off <i>el autobús</i>!
I have to have my baby in America!

1139
01:23:03,805 --> 01:23:05,432
I've got the bags.

1140
01:23:11,066 --> 01:23:13,591
Whoa, that's my bag.

1141
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:16,600
- No, it's mine.
- It's my bag.

1142
01:23:20,565 --> 01:23:23,628
Hi, Emma. We're friends of your dad's,
so just follow me, okay?

1143
01:23:23,668 --> 01:23:25,602
Look, it's my bag, okay?

1144
01:23:25,747 --> 01:23:27,180
Drop the bag.

1145
01:23:27,283 --> 01:23:28,682
It's my bag!

1146
01:23:29,362 --> 01:23:30,795
Drop the bag.

1147
01:23:41,836 --> 01:23:43,064
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1148
01:23:47,594 --> 01:23:50,057
It's just like dismounting a stretch
pyramid.

1149
01:23:50,089 --> 01:23:51,750
Off the bus!

1150
01:23:51,944 --> 01:23:53,241
You ready?

1151
01:23:53,415 --> 01:23:54,643
One, two.

1152
01:23:56,902 --> 01:23:58,392
Move it!

1153
01:23:59,236 --> 01:24:01,383
- Come on, Emma.
- Are you guys serious?

1154
01:24:01,411 --> 01:24:02,605
I'm a math major.

1155
01:24:02,658 --> 01:24:03,852
Move it!

1156
01:24:04,738 --> 01:24:06,797
You, too! Off the bus, now!

1157
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:13,874
- Come on, you can do it!
- Jump!

1158
01:24:42,994 --> 01:24:44,461
You all right?

1159
01:24:51,789 --> 01:24:53,051
I'm fine.

1160
01:26:45,116 --> 01:26:46,481
Halt, <i>señor</i>.

1161
01:27:13,710 --> 01:27:17,880
Eddie, there's doctors, air conditioning
and three meals a day back in town.

1162
01:27:17,933 --> 01:27:19,901
And I need you to testify.

1163
01:27:21,676 --> 01:27:24,144
You're gonna have to kill me, Sharp.

1164
01:27:34,821 --> 01:27:35,845
God!

1165
01:27:36,709 --> 01:27:37,767
Damn.

1166
01:28:10,646 --> 01:28:12,409
Looking sharp, Sharp.

1167
01:28:13,013 --> 01:28:16,141
I don't know.
Maybe we should do another mask.

1168
01:28:16,307 --> 01:28:19,140
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. I almost
forgot.

1169
01:28:22,704 --> 01:28:23,762
Cute.

1170
01:28:23,824 --> 01:28:26,759
Oh, my God! I'm so sorry. Damn it.

1171
01:28:27,374 --> 01:28:30,571
The language! Hello, we're in a church.

1172
01:28:33,100 --> 01:28:34,465
Look at you.

1173
01:28:35,978 --> 01:28:39,072
Hey, you guys.
Could you excuse us for a second?

1174
01:28:39,529 --> 01:28:41,156
- Sure.
- Yeah, okay.

1175
01:28:41,512 --> 01:28:42,877
Don't be nervous.

1176
01:28:42,920 --> 01:28:46,686
And Sharp, remember,
inspire and electrify, okay?

1177
01:28:46,789 --> 01:28:48,279
See you. Great.

1178
01:28:53,251 --> 01:28:55,241
I feel like a freak show in this dress.

1179
01:28:55,267 --> 01:28:58,393
Prettiest freak show I ever saw.
Wait till they see you at Vassar.

1180
01:28:58,433 --> 01:28:59,764
Actually...

1181
01:29:00,096 --> 01:29:04,055
I was thinking of turning Vassar down
and becoming a cheerleader.

1182
01:29:06,333 --> 01:29:07,994
Dad, that was a joke.

1183
01:29:08,828 --> 01:29:11,422
A joke. That's why I'm laughing so hard.

1184
01:29:18,168 --> 01:29:19,795
I love you, Daddy.

1185
01:29:24,309 --> 01:29:26,140
I love you, too, baby.

1186
01:29:27,828 --> 01:29:29,420
Dearly beloved...

1187
01:29:29,652 --> 01:29:32,382
we are gathered here for this most...

1188
01:29:32,690 --> 01:29:37,218
splendiferous and loquacious occasion...

1189
01:29:38,607 --> 01:29:41,576
to join this couple in holy matrimony.

1190
01:29:42,158 --> 01:29:44,126
Now, Roland...

1191
01:29:44,940 --> 01:29:48,603
do you promise to love this woman,
and...

1192
01:29:49,258 --> 01:29:52,250
before you answer, remember that...

1193
01:30:09,377 --> 01:30:10,537
Percy!

1194
01:30:12,224 --> 01:30:13,555
Get on with it.

1195
01:30:13,759 --> 01:30:15,488
Sure, but of course.

1196
01:30:16,319 --> 01:30:18,048
- Well, do you?
- I do.

1197
01:30:18,461 --> 01:30:20,088
And, Molly...

1198
01:30:20,957 --> 01:30:23,448
radiant, beautiful Molly.

1199
01:30:24,314 --> 01:30:27,283
Molly. Good Golly, Miss Molly.

1200
01:30:31,576 --> 01:30:35,012
Do you promise to love Roland...

1201
01:30:35,925 --> 01:30:38,359
when he is odiferous...

1202
01:30:38,964 --> 01:30:41,228
indifferent, belligerent?

1203
01:30:41,427 --> 01:30:42,485
I do.

1204
01:30:43,410 --> 01:30:45,071
- You do?
- I do.

1205
01:30:46,641 --> 01:30:47,699
Well.

1206
01:30:48,241 --> 01:30:51,699
By the power vested in me
in the state of Texas...

1207
01:30:51,855 --> 01:30:54,160
I now pronounce you man and wife.

1208
01:30:54,190 --> 01:30:56,124
You may kiss your bride.

1209
01:31:12,006 --> 01:31:14,975
Come on, y'all, let's get this party
started.

1210
01:31:56,179 --> 01:31:57,612
Who put this table here?
