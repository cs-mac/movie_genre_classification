1
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,036
(bells ring)

2
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,116
My name is Antoni Clarke,
and I am a bride's best friend.

3
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,309
I'm not gay.

4
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,949
(Antoni) Now, I own "Confetti" magazine,
but Vivien is the editor,

5
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,713
and she's really
the backbone of the publication.

6
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,236
She does all the day-to-day work, if you like.

7
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,950
This will be the event of the year. We haVe
to really go for it as the event of the year.

8
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,797
It's immense, because our reputation
is hanging on a thread if we fail in this.

9
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,792
It's half an hour on a Saturday afternoon.

10
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,950
Three weddings. It's easy.

11
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:32,352
All you haVe to do is hold up a card
and say, "Ten out of ten," or, "Nil points."

12
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:36,115
We were going to do
another Bride of the Year competition,

13
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,239
but we thought that would just end up being
giVen to a woman in a white dress again.

14
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,233
So we thought we'd do
The Most Original Wedding as an idea.

15
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,474
We're giving away a house
to the couple with the most original wedding.

16
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,269
Not everyone
wants to get married in a crazy way.

17
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,957
Not everyone wants their special day
ruined by a gimmick. But some people do.

18
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,193
(snarling)

19
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,719
Pitch us your Vision
of the most original wedding.

20
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,588
OK. Well, erm, we're really
into dinosaurs, raptors, actually.

21
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:17,231
- It's a dinosaur themed wedding?
- Absolutely. We want it in a caVe, first of all.

22
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,073
- Thanks so much for coming.
- Already? So soon?

23
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,754
- (Antoni) I don't want to waste your time.
- (roars)

24
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,308
Hi, hello. Thank you so much for coming.

25
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,431
All the guys are going to be dressed
as EIVis Presley.

26
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,637
And the girls will be dressed as teddy girls.

27
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,757
- (Vivien) Do you think it's been done before?
- No.

28
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,353
Right. Next.

29
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,989
ViVien, am I going to be
meeting more mental people today?

30
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,710
We're going to get married
following the Daffodil Route round Wales.

31
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,712
It's a train route, it starts at Cardiff...

32
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,917
I appreciate you want to win a house,
it's not gonna happen.

33
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,355
(man) Good three changes
on the way here.

34
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,113
You fucking loVed it, didn't you?
You loVe the train.

35
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,634
You know, she was tremendously pretty.

36
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,314
We could partner her up with somebody else.

37
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,439
Well, what we had in mind
was a kind of ancient Roman wedding.

38
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,794
Great!

39
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,078
It starts with the sacrifice of a pig
at the bride's house.

40
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,909
Fuck me.

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,913
But maybe with some hairstyle around it,
and prescription lens.

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,956
(Antoni) Oh... Next.

43
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,031
- (honks horn)
- (Antoni) Get out.

44
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,590
If we were producing a sort of
updated Version of The Joy of Sex,

45
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,558
you two would be perfect.

46
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,913
(Antoni) Naturists, or "The Joy of Sex"?

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,436
The Joy of Sex are better-looking,
but the naturists...

48
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,715
Well, it's more... It's more Confetti.

49
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,837
Well, I don't want them at all.
I'd rather haVe the Romans.

50
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:47,755
That's as may be. Naturists, tennis, musicals.

51
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,630
Our submission was accepted,

52
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,190
and our submission, by the way,
we should probably say, is musicals.

53
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,510
- A musical wedding.
- Hollywood musicals.

54
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,318
That's what we're going for.

55
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:11,038
(Sam) The idea that we picked is,
it's in the style of the sort of Busby Berkeley,

56
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,395
so it's a big kind of production number.

57
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,155
We're haVing the sort of bridesmaids
as the chorus girls.

58
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:22,155
You know, they haVe the sweeping kind
of staircase of bridesmaids in those films,

59
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,995
and Jen, my sister, obViously,
she'll be bridesmaid of honour, won't she?

60
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,036
- Absolutely.
- She's away at the moment.

61
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,509
She's a dancer.
She's in Bahrain with a cruise.

62
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,990
(mother) She travels around a lot,
we don't always know where she is.

63
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:43,276
Erm, I work in a care home for the elderly.
Sam comes along sometimes and helps out.

64
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,669
She sings for them, loVely.

65
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,399
I'm slightly tone-deaf, but Matt's always said

66
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,756
if I wasrt tone-deaf,
I'd haVe a Very good Voice.

67
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,549
- Yeah, I think that's true.
- So, you know, I enjoy it.

68
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,918
It's all confidence, that's all it is.
A lot of it is confidence.

69
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,077
Well, the Vision for our wedding
is quite simple. Tennis.

70
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,355
Tennis.

71
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,955
Yeah! Whoo! Come on, Josef.

72
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,998
I mean, we are gonna win.
If you're listening, losers,

73
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,469
the other people in the competition,
giVe it up.

74
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,869
- Stop.
- Stop now, cos we're gonna win.

75
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:27,310
It's not about how good our wedding is,
it's about can we do anything to make theirs...

76
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:32,076
That's what you do in tennis. You look at
someone's game, and you haVe to destroy it.

77
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,797
Yeah, we haVe a coach. Well, I say "coach"...

78
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,950
- We haVe a coach.
- He's, uh...

79
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,919
Jesus. He's amazing. He's so supportiVe.

80
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,197
My inner game has gone at the moment,
he's working on that with me.

81
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,555
So in the court, that's what we're working on.

82
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:53,553
- He's Very interested in getting inside you.
- He's fantastic at it.

83
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:01,630
# I like to ride my bicycle

84
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,392
# With you

85
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,994
- Well, I'm Michael, this is Joanna.
- Joanna.

86
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,072
And, er, yeah,
I'Ve been a naturist all my life.

87
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,276
Joanna's... Oh.

88
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,148
And Joanna's quite new to it, really. Um...

89
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,231
I'm a beginner.

90
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,150
(Joanna) Summerland. It's the oldest
naturist camp in the country.

91
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,516
Mum and Dad liVed here,
and they were naturists.

92
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,752
(Joanna) Well, my dad was a policeman,
my mum worked as a legal secretary.

93
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,277
And they do think...
They do worry a bit that I'm in a cult.

94
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,270
It's not a cult.

95
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,595
It's not a cult.

96
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,555
- I mean, we are all naked, apart from clothes.
- All the time.

97
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,438
And when you take the clothes off,
it's more obVious.

98
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,877
I know I'm... For this film, I'm supposed
to sit like this so you can't see my penis,

99
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:01,478
but, you know, I'm looking at my penis now,
and it seems absolutely fine to me.

100
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:08,313
Now, the auditions we had, I was Very
excited about it, but I'm not particularly now.

101
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,188
One is a potential idea,
perhaps, the musical couple.

102
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:16,239
No, no, no, we're going back
to singing out of tune again, dear.

103
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,754
The tennis couple maybe could work.

104
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,150
But the girl,
she has the most extraordinary nostrils.

105
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,959
I mean, I can't take my eyes off them.

106
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,830
If you put that on a front coVer, the nation
won't be able to take their eyes off them.

107
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,036
The third choice...

108
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,872
Oh.

109
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:38,511
I mean, where do you want me to start?
They want to be on the front coVer naked.

110
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,591
But I'm optimistic.

111
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,071
I haVe my wedding planners
coming in soon, and...

112
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,152
Heron and Hough,
and they seem absolutely dynamic.

113
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,076
(man) Push a bit from the other side.
That's it. You all right?

114
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,514
Come in, come in.

115
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,989
- Hi!
- Hello.

116
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,154
This is my partner.

117
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,515
- Heron and Hough.
- Your dreams are enough.

118
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,035
I think this is going to be
the most extraordinary,

119
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,112
theatrical, wedding loVe celebration.

120
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,760
- Three-ring circus.
- A three-ring circus of loVe.

121
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,796
We're going to be right at its centre.

122
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,038
Don't show them that.
Come away, don't show them that.

123
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,758
- This...
- No, stop it.

124
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,118
This is our award wall.

125
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,953
- You shouldn't show them that, Archie.
- I know, but...

126
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,076
Don't show them that one, or that one.

127
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,876
We're not clear on budget, are we?

128
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,633
(Archie) But the great thing is,
it's a big magazine.

129
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,554
So I think we're safely assuming
there will be some money to spend.

130
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,709
Just a little bit.

131
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:48,430
(Archie) So we've already started. We haven't
met the couples, but we have a load of ideas

132
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:53,071
- that we wanted to kind of spring on them.
- And I think one's first instinct is the best.

133
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,357
- Black and silVer sparkle.
- Oh, loVely. Good choice.

134
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,031
(Archie) Also we're up against time.

135
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,032
We would often plan a wedding
over 9, 12, 18 months,

136
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,112
and we have three months
to plan three weddings.

137
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,399
- (Gregory) Which we're up for.
- Mad as cheese, the pair of us. As cheese.

138
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,554
What we giVe people is a huge part
of ourselVes. It's our wedding, on the day.

139
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,029
- (Gregory) We have not lost one yet.
- No.

140
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,396
There is nobody who has been married
at a wedding we haVe organised

141
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,152
who is not still together.

142
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,509
- (grunts)
- (cries out)

143
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,591
Oh, come on, don't serVe so hard to her.

144
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,592
- What do you mean, don't serVe so hard?
- You're a man...

145
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,671
Are you here? Are you in the room?

146
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,513
- Do it again.
- Do what again? SerVe, so you can miss it?

147
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,591
Jesus is, uh...

148
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,673
exceptionally,
an exceptionally mediocre coach.

149
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,436
Oh, well, my name is Jesus
and I'm from Spain. Um...

150
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,839
Yup.

151
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,276
That's the difficulties of my name,
cos it's also called "Jesus".

152
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:01,150
I mean, if anyone goes around
calling himself "Jesus", frankly it's a bit sad.

153
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:05,233
There must be a deep well
of insecurity in there.

154
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,157
I will hurt if they getting married,

155
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,630
because I think
he is not the appropriate man for her.

156
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,156
Yeah, that's character.
I mean, she needs more loVe,

157
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:23,076
she needs more smiling,
and she needs a little bit more of sweetness.

158
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,637
- Back.
- (whispers) It's really helping.

159
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,438
And front.

160
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,034
- Don't stop. I think this is good.
- What's good?

161
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,111
- Just wait. Keep going.
- You tired?

162
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,078
- No, I'm not... I'm not ti-red.
- You can sit down, yeah?

163
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,435
- Just for the...
- If anything, I'm "tired".

164
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,839
- PositiVe.
- Sorry.

165
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:45,038
Just for the opening, I was feeling something.
Take my hand.

166
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,714
- What were you feeling?
- That this could be used.

167
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,791
- For the wedding?
- Used in the wedding?

168
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,031
- That will be excellent.
- Who's getting married?

169
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,431
(Josef) He goes on about how
warm they are in the Mediterranean,

170
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:03,277
they're very tactile, but he doesn't touch
anyone as much as he touches my fiancee.

171
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,351
I don't think...

172
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,471
Oi!

173
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,549
I'm watching.

174
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:17,390
(Josef) Rules of entry, number one: You
hereby confirm you're not already married.

175
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:22,873
Two: You agree to participate
in pre-marriage counselling.

176
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,951
Counselling.

177
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,631
- Counselling.
- Yes.

178
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,591
- I'm not doing counselling.
- Josef...

179
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:37,959
I'm not doing counselling. I'Ve done
counselling, you know that. I'm not doing it.

180
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,109
I'm not doing it!

181
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,475
Let's just concentrate
on how we want these people to look.

182
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,792
I mean, the tennis players, Isabelle and Josef.
We want them to look so glamorous.

183
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,510
- Well, we want them to win, don't we?
- Yes. I quite like, erm, the musical couple.

184
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,909
- (woman) They'll look wonderful.
- Sweet.

185
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,752
She's a little dowdy.

186
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,559
No, she'll be fine
if we dress her in a beautiful dress.

187
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:05,156
You never know on the day, either. The
naturist couple on the day might be fantastic.

188
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,629
I don't think anyone wants to see her muff.

189
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,790
You chose them.

190
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,271
# Summer breeze and blue, blue sky

191
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,920
# Memories of that beautiful delight

192
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,514
(Gregory) I was quite excited
by the people we met.

193
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,275
I think of the three couples,
I think I wouldn't want to faVour any of them.

194
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:36,114
I think they're all exciting,
they're Very much in loVe, I think.

195
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:41,433
I have slight problems with the tennis,
Isabelle and Josef.

196
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:47,794
(Archie) A woman that only wears things that
she's knitted herself is going to be difficult.

197
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,952
Yes, and they did smell.

198
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,510
#... to the time when we were so carefree

199
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,076
# And easy

200
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,390
# Building castles in the sand

201
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,755
# While our dreams are strolling hand in hand

202
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,671
# I like the love you bring

203
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,436
# You're the song I sing, and everything is you

204
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,716
- It was...
- It was a really good day.

205
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,713
- Yeah, it was an amazing day.
- There was so many things to see, and...

206
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,555
(Matt) And also from the time
that Sam had the makeover.

207
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,709
That would be enough, the fact that
she was chosen to have a makeover...

208
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,279
Oh, my God.

209
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:31,317
# I see tomorrow in her eyes

210
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:39,512
# And where my future lies

211
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:46,755
# So I don't need a crystal ball at all

212
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:53,109
# Because I've seen tomorrow in her eyes

213
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:59,309
# And time shall hold no sad surprise

214
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:08,039
# More hellos than goodbyes

215
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:15,431
# So I don't need a crystal ball at all

216
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:22,198
# Because I've seen tomorrow in her eyes

217
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:28,719
# I've seen tomorrow in her eyes

218
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,956
(Josef) They just happened to pick her

219
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,952
to have a makeover
out of all those people in the audience.

220
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,873
So we had to haVe a word.

221
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,712
A ciVil word.

222
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:44,430
And they kindly agreed to, uh, to go again.

223
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,199
(woman) Oh, doesn't she look gorgeous!

224
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:54,559
Big round of applause for the loVely Isabella.

225
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,995
Iook, she's got herself in the picture.
She's got herself in the...

226
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,150
Just... See, at the back?

227
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,389
Hi.

228
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,353
- Oh, hi.
- Hello.

229
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,396
Come on in.

230
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,632
- LoVely to see you.
- You too. Perch yourself on the couch.

231
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,951
- LoVely to see you. In you come.
- LoVely to see you.

232
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:25,309
OK. Well, you know, first and foremost, thank
you so much for coming and doing this job.

233
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,437
- We are so excited.
- Good. I'm thrilled.

234
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,317
Now, to cut to the chase.

235
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,676
There are several things
that are on my mind at the moment.

236
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:37,639
Firstly, I need... And this has also
come from the powers-that-be aboVe.

237
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,110
I need one Venue for all three weddings.

238
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,350
For the wedding competition.

239
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,635
- For all the weddings?
- That's right, yes.

240
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,917
Cos we thought about
Queers Club and Roland Garros.

241
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,197
Well, I loVe your ideas.
But they're not within the budget.

242
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,669
So, um, one Venue.

243
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:59,038
Now, the second point is, and one
that does concern me oVer the naturists, erm,

244
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,477
I need... I need the naked girl dressed.
I need her in a dress.

245
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,159
- In a dress?
- In a dress.

246
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,913
- But they're nudists, aren't they?
- No, naturists.

247
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,514
Well, yes, but they take their clothes off.

248
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,592
- Well, I need them in a dress.
- Does she know that?

249
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,752
No. That's yourjob, to tell her.

250
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,114
(Gregory) Right.

251
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,115
- (Archie) Do they actually play Volleyball?
- We're going to find out.

252
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,158
I feel a bit sick, actually, Archie.

253
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:32,155
- (Archie) Oh, my God.
- Oh! It's a naked man on a bike! A naked...

254
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,231
(Archie) Just keep your eye on the road.

255
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,357
- (Gregory, laughing) Did you see?
- I'm choosing to ignore it.

256
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,954
(Gregory) No clothes on,
riding around...

257
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,508
(Archie) Just pull up here. Pull up here.

258
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,398
Will there be any...
Yes, it'll be obVious, won't it?

259
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,153
- It'll be obVious when we meet them.
- What are they...

260
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,231
(Joanna) Hi!

261
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,953
- How you doing? You all right?
- (Joanna) Hey, there.

262
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,874
- Nice to see you again. Hi, how you doing?
- Hi. Joanna.

263
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,713
- Archie.
- Hi, there.

264
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,756
- Glad you made it.
- I stood on your toe.

265
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,035
- Oh, I'm all right.
- Thanks for coming.

266
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,475
- Well, let's...
- We'll show you round.

267
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,833
- Hi, guys.
- Hello.

268
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,911
- Hi.
- Hi.

269
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,839
You know, you haVe a really good game
of badminton, then no need to wash your kit.

270
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,593
Well, that's a bonus.

271
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,274
- Do you play badminton?
- No.

272
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,828
You are aware that these weddings will all...

273
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:33,675
All three competitors will haVe their weddings
in the same Venue, on the same day?

274
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,990
One after another, sort of concurrently.

275
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,958
- In a Venue?
- It doesn't, it... No, I didn't know that.

276
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,429
No, it... it... it doesn't absolutely...

277
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,910
Well, it is clear,
but it isn't underlined, or anything.

278
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,276
Itjust says
you haVe to approVe where we do it.

279
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:53,150
Well, the magazine approVes, and they'Ve
decided that to make it easier for the judges,

280
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,038
it all has to be inside and on one occasion.

281
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,476
- (Michael) What's that?
- This is Primavera.

282
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,154
- Who's he?
- No, that's a painting by Botticelli.

283
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,595
- Oh, sorry.
- And itjust... You said nature.

284
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,035
It explores some of the themes of nature.

285
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:12,353
You'Ve got these apples, pears and things,
and the elements (blows) blowing on her,

286
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:16,115
and there's flowers and so on,
and the strength of this sword.

287
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,557
And she's just slightly Veiled,
and you can see the nakedness underneath.

288
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,598
But that's just wacky costumes.
It's just costumes.

289
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:28,993
(Joanna) It's kind of theatre, isn't it?
It's not real. And we're about nature and real.

290
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:33,153
- Oh, hi. Thanks ever so much.
- Quite all right. Where do you want them?

291
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,276
(Joanna) I'll moVe those. Thanks.

292
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,352
- (woman) Quite all right.
- (Joanna) Thanks, Becky.

293
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:43,559
What do we do? They're going to want
to walk in and take their clothes off.

294
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,232
- Arert they?
- (Archie) Yes.

295
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,278
- You think we should allow that?
- If that's what they want.

296
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:52,319
Good. I think that too. If they want to do that,
they should be allowed to do that.

297
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,278
To ask them to get married, in...
you know, clothed,

298
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,794
is contrary to everything we believe in.

299
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:02,271
So, yes, they must be naked people as they
get married, because that's who they are.

300
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,873
Right. IoVely. So.

301
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,030
- Musical.
- Musicals. The King And I.

302
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:10,830
Oh, it's not The King And I.
Why does it haVe to be The King And I?

303
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,196
- King And I this, King And I that.
- It offers so much designwise.

304
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:18,034
It's East meets West, there's
a fantastic opportunity for food there,

305
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,554
you know I can...
I can get hold of elephants.

306
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,712
I'm thinking Singir in the Rain,
I can just see it.

307
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:28,874
We can haVe the rain from the Wimbledon
falling all oVer the MGM and we'd just be...

308
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,679
Or On the Town. Oh, please, On the Town.

309
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,832
- I hate On the Town.
- How can you hate On the Town?

310
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,195
It's that woman in the cab.
She driVes me mad.

311
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,111
Oh, she's wonderful.

312
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,832
(Archie) So, folks. El maestro.

313
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,229
- This is Paul. Sam.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

314
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,754
Nice to meet you.

315
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,558
- Hi, Matt.
- Nice to see you.

316
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,914
(Sam) Oh, how are you?

317
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,120
Paul has been working with us
on some ideas for your wedding,

318
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,192
- which we'd like to show you.
- This is nice, isn't it?

319
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:04,910
So we'Ve put some stools out.
We'Ve kind of... It's like a little show.

320
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,072
- If you could take the stools, we're going to...
- What, now?

321
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,639
- Right now.
- Take a pew.

322
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,952
And we want to show you what we'Ve come
up with as potential Vows for your wedding.

323
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,635
- Shall I take my coat off?
- (Paul plays piano)

324
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,833
# I giVe you my loVe

325
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,195
# Always

326
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,750
# To haVe and to hold

327
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,434
# Always

328
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,909
# Our life to unfold

329
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,312
# As man and wife

330
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,113
# Always

331
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,550
# Always

332
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:51,318
# I giVe my life to you

333
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:56,394
# EVermore shall my heart be true

334
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:05,316
# For the rest of our liVes we'll liVe as one

335
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,674
# Always

336
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:16,312
- # Always
- # Always

337
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,471
- That is really amazing.
- (Gregory) Exciting, isn't it?

338
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,120
- That is... That's amazing.
- Do you like that?

339
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,795
Yeah. I loVe it, and it's a bit like ours.

340
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,110
- Show us.
- (Sam) Ours isn't as good...

341
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,634
I'm sure it is,
we just cobbled that together.

342
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,951
I'm sure we can get some sort
of middle ground between the two.

343
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:43,595
# (tunelessly) I promise to loVe you

344
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:48,708
# I promise to care for you

345
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:54,079
# I promise to always make you laugh

346
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,628
You're both singing in different keys.

347
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,631
- Yep.
- Yeah, that's...

348
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,029
- Is that how...?
...harmony.

349
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:06,513
We know now we can't be here, but if
we get married there, it has to be clothed.

350
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,989
- I don't...
- For me, it has to be clothed.

351
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,548
- But for me, it does haVe to be.
- You want it to be?

352
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,871
Well, I'm happy as a naturist with you,
and with naturists.

353
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,952
But I'm not happy being undressed
in front of clothed people.

354
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:21,271
It's been your life forever,
and I'm new to it still.

355
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,999
You won't giVe them nightmares.
You look beautiful.

356
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,755
- It's not... They'll laugh. Someone will laugh.
- They won't laugh.

357
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,435
I'm not prepared to feel shame
and feel humiliation on our wedding day.

358
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,718
It's completely their problem though.
I think it's your mum that does this.

359
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,872
Think about your mum now.
Picture your mum.

360
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,757
Do you want to get dressed?

361
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,593
Yes. See? There we go. It's her.

362
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:47,468
She's so... clothed.

363
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:51,758
- (loud rock)
- # When we were young

364
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,354
# You used to laugh so much

365
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,479
# But now you're always buying wine

366
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:02,439
# And wanking on about your sofa

367
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,954
I'm like Eno on speed.

368
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,110
It's just like you take the whole thing...

369
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,794
- Speedo.
- Speedo.

370
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:14,192
This is what we're like, innit?
This is what we used to be like.

371
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,272
- Well, we still are, it's all right.
- Yeah.

372
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,839
# You made your bed

373
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,434
# And I hope you lie in it

374
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:28,513
# With the girl who stole our dreams away

375
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,558
# She's just like Yoko Ono

376
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,598
# Dead man walking

377
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:38,992
# Can't you,
can't you hear your old friend talking

378
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,514
We can do Wizard of Oz. Right?

379
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,353
Well, Wizard of Oz is a musical, OK, all right?

380
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:49,468
- Do you mean at the wedding?
- Yes. You'Ve got the bass, the Cowardly lion.

381
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,996
The Tin Man on drums.
You'Ve got Dorothy on guitar.

382
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,675
- You'Ve got the, um, second guitar can be...
- Toto.

383
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,479
Toto, yes.
I could be the monkey with the wings.

384
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:04,395
I just think you're taking the mickey.
I don't think you're taking it seriously.

385
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,277
- Flaming lips do it.
- It's not ajoke.

386
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,954
It's not ajoke, Snoopy, it's our wedding.

387
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,759
Flaming lips do it. HaVe you heard...
I can speak to her.

388
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,956
You don't really need to speak to her.

389
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,476
I'll haVe to calm this one down,
she thinks you're taking the piss.

390
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,154
No, mate, it's just the monkey tipped it oVer.

391
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,119
- Soon as I said the monkey with the wings...
- I don't know if it was the monkey.

392
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,670
I saw her face, it dropped.
If you don't want a monkey, don't haVe it.

393
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,479
It wasrt an integral part.
I could be a wicked witch.

394
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:37,029
- (Isabelle) I am anxious.
- (Josef) We both are. Today is a big day,

395
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,908
we've got the wedding planners coming in,
and those... lovely fellas

396
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,833
hopefully will have come up
with something exciting,

397
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,956
because we've not heard much.

398
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:49,157
(Isabelle) No, not much.
And we gave them a lot of information.

399
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,755
- We're hoping they'll come back...
- (Josef) With something concrete.

400
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:56,674
- Sorry we're so late.
- That's OK, let's start. Let's waste no time.

401
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:00,036
Iook, shall we just show you?
We'Ve got it in our heads.

402
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,759
- Opening of your ceremony.
- Brilliant.

403
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:06,196
- Where do you want us?
- If you just go oVer there.

404
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:09,556
- Imagine you're the congregation and we're...
- (Josef) Right.

405
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,995
(Archie) And we're sort of looking that way.

406
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,629
- What?
- Let's giVe them a chance. You never know.

407
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,510
The parade of the ball boys.

408
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,033
On they come!

409
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,197
Go!

410
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,433
Go!

411
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,713
Oof!

412
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:46,873
(Gregory) And then,
from the back come your gigantic balls.

413
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,549
- All the way down, on the tramlines, hm?
- Right.

414
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,677
And then you perform your Vows.
Then you're married.

415
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:00,275
And that's the start. What do you think?

416
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,316
(Gregory laughs)

417
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:06,230
(Josef) That's not... We need
to speak to someone professional.

418
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,595
I mean, you moVe beautifully, both of you,

419
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:12,389
but we need someone who knows
what they're doing. Properly.

420
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,359
- (Archie) Well...
- With, um, ball boys and ball girls, don't we?

421
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,192
- Yeah.
- So a choreographer.

422
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:21,078
We think that the choreographer, really,

423
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:26,439
should be the remit
of the MGM wedding couple.

424
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,239
We can't haVe the choreographer
cos they'Ve got one?

425
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:33,518
(Archie) Well, because their dance
is sort of key, central to their...

426
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,751
- It's central to ours.
- I'Ve worked a lot on it.

427
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,718
Right before you guys came in,
I was working on the moVes.

428
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:44,316
- She does dancing.
- I saw that. I thought you'd injured yourself.

429
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,358
Yeah, whatever, whatever. We need a...

430
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,158
We asked for...

431
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,434
(Jesus) Ahem!

432
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,717
- The problem...
- Oh, for fuck's sake, it's Jesus.

433
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,950
Can you get rid of him? Get rid of him.

434
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,553
Um...

435
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,598
I haVe to explain something.
We must win this competition.

436
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,513
There's no question of if, but or maybe,
we haVe to win it.

437
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,672
We are in severe financial...
What are you doing?

438
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,876
- I inVited him along.
- Can you go away?

439
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,076
- No, I inVited him here.
- I want him to go.

440
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,913
- I want him to stay!
- I want him to go!

441
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,833
Listen, speak nice to her.
She's going to be your wife...

442
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,717
No, can you go?

443
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:23,112
- What's it like being short? Do you like it?
- Josef, stop being rude all the time!

444
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,557
What's the weather like down there?
What's the Spanish for "Go away, you fairy"?

445
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:31,269
- Josef, stop it.
- You haVe to say "I loVe you" to her. Not...

446
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,715
I'm sorry? What do you haVe to say to her?

447
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,836
- Don't touch me.
- I'm not touching you.

448
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,354
- Stop it!
- I'm not touching you.

449
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,715
- (Gregory) Stop it!
- Josef!

450
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,597
No, no!

451
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,671
No, no, no!

452
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,953
Now, listen! Listen, please, please.

453
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:52,350
- Please, please, please listen. Please.
- (Josef) Get off me...

454
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,431
Please, now listen to me.

455
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:58,752
You do not haVe an education from a boy's
boarding school in the north of England

456
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:02,037
and be the only gay boy,
and not know how to handle yourself.

457
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:05,795
So if you moVe again, I'm going
to break your arm. Do you understand?

458
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,030
(Jesus) He doesn't deserVe you.

459
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:11,430
(Isabelle) He'll be fine.
He just... he just needs to run it off.

460
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,354
- (Jesus) Sorry.
- That's fine. It's fine. So, from the top.

461
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,749
(Gregory) I think we should just...

462
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,478
No!

463
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,835
No, no, no, no!

464
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,480
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

465
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:28,519
You stop it, you stop it!
And you stop it, just stop it!

466
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:32,309
It's ridiculous! It's just stupid!

467
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,152
I come here for this?

468
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,755
I was appalled by that, and shocked.

469
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,628
It was... It was terrifying.
It was a terrifying experience.

470
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,315
It's in my top ten terrifying experiences.

471
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:50,155
It's just not what we're used to.
It's not the world we work in, really.

472
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:55,155
But, you know, we showed them a few things,
and we'll come back and show them more.

473
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,310
You showed them some things.

474
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,472
You stood up for me,
and you stood up for yourself.

475
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:04,189
It was amazing. It was wonderful, Archie.

476
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,989
It was really wonderful, you do know that?
I'm so proud of you.

477
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,469
Come on, let's go.
We'll see you later. Bye.

478
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,551
Bye.

479
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,835
- People don't like me, do they?
- Josef, people like you.

480
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,717
- Who?
- I like you.

481
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,279
- You don't count.
- Why not?

482
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,716
Well, you do count,
but you don't count in people who like me.

483
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,109
- Why not?
- Because you obViously like me.

484
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,510
Well, do you like me? I don't like me.

485
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,914
Maybe that's the real problem.

486
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,070
- Thank you, Dr Freud.
- I'm just saying.

487
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:39,277
I haVe a lot more experience.
I mean, I went to counselling.

488
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,555
I'm not going to counselling.
Don't start.

489
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:47,351
I'm just saying if you'd stayed a bit longer,
we'd haVe answered some of these questions.

490
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,638
We're gonna get you in a positiVe space
right now. I don't feel that you are.

491
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,711
Know what we'Ve got?

492
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,912
You want to hold that for a while?
Hold it.

493
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,989
Huh?

494
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,071
That's what we'Ve got. We'Ve got...

495
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,833
I won this ten years ago.

496
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,434
Hold this. Come on, hold it.

497
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,750
Iook at me. Hnngh! Come on.

498
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,910
Come on, Josef, gimme that!

499
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,752
That's it!

500
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,757
- Hello, there!
- Gregory, how you doing? All right?

501
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,229
- Hello, Sam, how are you?
- Hi, hi.

502
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,233
- This is Jen, my sister.
- Oh, hello. Nice to meet you.

503
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,949
So if you two loVebirds
would like to flutter down with me.

504
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,998
- Do you want to come as well?
- Jers coming as well.

505
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,516
Jers really interested.
Jers a professional choreographer...

506
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,751
- Professional dancer and choreographer.
- A choreographer?

507
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,230
She'd like to...
She's going to be choreographing the show.

508
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:48,039
- Oh.
- I'Ve got loads of ideas, cos I'Ve done loads.

509
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:52,238
You know, I'Ve been dancing for 12 years,
so I'Ve got loads of ideas worked out.

510
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,835
We're sorry about the other lady,
but Jen really wants to do it.

511
00:30:55,920 --> 00:31:00,755
Well, we haVe the best dance choreographer
in the country. You do realise that?

512
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:04,071
I was just explaining...
Well, we were just explaining,

513
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:07,357
- I'm actually a professional choreographer.
- Oh, really?

514
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,638
- So we'Ve kind of come up with a few ideas.
- Yeah.

515
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:16,840
And what we're kind of thinking is
we'Ve kind of got it wrapped up, really.

516
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,911
I mean, I can show you a few...

517
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,913
I'm not quite sure what the ideas are
originally. I'm a bit new to this.

518
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,639
- Well, shall I...
- Can you explain what it is?

519
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,553
Cos I don't know that it is all wrapped up yet.

520
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:33,953
It's like, the theme that we'Ve gone after,
right, is a kind of '30s and '40s musical.

521
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:37,271
- Right. Fred Astaire and all that.
- Exactly. Exactly.

522
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:41,512
- Who's the water woman?
- Oh, it's sort of like an Esther Williams style.

523
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,478
Oh, right, yes.
With hundreds of girls, and all of that.

524
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,551
ObViously a smaller Version of that.

525
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,713
I mean, it's like... You know.
I just might as well hop up.

526
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,030
- Jers worked some moVes out.
- Right.

527
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,680
- Two rows of girls...
- Is she allowed on the stage?

528
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,149
...Busby Berkeley, all the tinfoil dresses.

529
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,232
And then it's like out,
the next girl out, the next girl out.

530
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,232
On the other side,
simultaneously, all at the same time,

531
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,118
out, next girl, out, next girl, out.

532
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,839
- Jen...
- And then, Matt and Sam can sink down,

533
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,912
and you know like
the dream ballet in Oklahoma!

534
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,231
Dream laurey comes out,
me, same costume, wig.

535
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,311
- So I'm Sam.
- (Matt) Jen...

536
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:23,554
(Jen) You know, itjust giVes you an idea.
We do stuff like it on the ships all the time.

537
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:28,191
If she'd like to do it, then that's fine.
You don't need me.

538
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,838
- She is not...
- Do you like...

539
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,956
What do you think about the dream ballet?

540
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:36,591
Cos Sam, you know, physical dyslexia,
and that, she's going to be all nerVous.

541
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,511
- What?
- Sorry?

542
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:42,115
- Well, Sam's got physical dyslexia.
- What's that?

543
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,475
Well, she's, like, clumsy.

544
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,718
- Clumsy? She can't dance?
- No, of course she can dance.

545
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,918
We did a lot of dancing as kids.
I mean, I did a lot of dancing.

546
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,437
I think it's great that we'Ve got Jen here
cos she can play a really strong role in this,

547
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:03,868
but I really feel that we'Ve got Jenny here,
who is an expert in choreography,

548
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,953
as opposed to a dancer,
and we should be using her like we said.

549
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,269
(mother) She's done cruise ships for years.

550
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,636
- Cruise ships, exactly.
- Who works out all the dances? She does.

551
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,188
- Right...
- Who's a professional dancer? She is.

552
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:20,590
- And this choreographer's not?
- All she wants to do

553
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:24,389
is help her sister on her wedding day.
Something wrong with that?

554
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,234
But this isn'tjust an ordinary wedding.
We'Ve entered a competition.

555
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,232
- We'Ve got to abide by the rules.
- It's her wedding day.

556
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:34,995
Yeah, and it's my wedding day as well.
It's my important day as well.

557
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,435
I'll be your sister.
HaVe you thought of that?

558
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,033
Jesus, every night.

559
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,749
I know you're stressed and tired
and you'Ve been getting up really...

560
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:47,994
You know, I know you're working hard,
and I... and I'm totally amazed...

561
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:52,039
I'm about to get married in a competition.
Of course I'm stressed.

562
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:56,238
But you're being so loVely, and you're
really putting your heart and soul into it.

563
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,357
- Yeah, for you.
- And I know that. But they don't know that.

564
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,193
Yeah, but they should know it.
Why don't they know it?

565
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,077
Yeah, because they'Ve not met...

566
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:07,709
They'Ve not met me? I'Ve liVed with
your flippir mum for nine months.

567
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,791
- They will see it, they will.
- Christ!

568
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:15,079
All I'm saying is that you need to go
and be a bit... Do a bit of diplomacy.

569
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,071
- Oh, yeah, I will.
- You know.

570
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:22,792
But I loVe you and I'm completely with you
and I'm totally, day by day,

571
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:28,079
I'm just amazed at how wonderful you are.

572
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,752
And, and...

573
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,638
I'm so pleased to be marrying you.

574
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:47,157
(Sam) I come down the aisle,
you're waiting at the altar,

575
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:51,552
in your top hat and tails, with Snoopy,
you know, doing the sway, whatever.

576
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:56,998
I come down, you know, shuffling down
the aisle, whatever. In time, hopefully.

577
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,196
And then meet you at the altar.

578
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,990
The other question that I'm worried about
as well is who's going to take me down there?

579
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,389
What about your dad?

580
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,040
I don't... I...

581
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:12,590
You know, I'm not sure
if he's gonna be there, to be honest.

582
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:15,114
At the moment
it doesn't look like he'll be there.

583
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,236
- Why?
- Well, because he's obViously...

584
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:20,630
- I haVert inVited him, Mum hasn't...
- Do you not want him...

585
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:25,919
I'd like him to be there,
but obViously I'm not in a position to...

586
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,992
To inVite your dad to your wedding?

587
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:33,117
I'm not in a position to...

588
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:40,312
I'm not in a position to... to do that.

589
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,233
You do want him there, don't you?

590
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:51,912
All right, your dad being at your wedding
is more important than anything else.

591
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,154
Or that your family being at your wedding
is more important than getting the song right.

592
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:02,519
I think your mum's going to haVe
to lump it for four hours of her life.

593
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,909
(chords on piano)

594
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,071
Feel this bit. That's it. Out.

595
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,068
And run to each other, and round.

596
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,754
And turn out.

597
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,637
And back. Hold his face.

598
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,676
(laughs)

599
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,876
- Not quite like that.
- Should I hold...

600
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,758
Where's Snoopy's bit?

601
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,229
Where's... We haVert done any of the music.

602
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,914
It's not all, it can't be this, surely, you know?

603
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,150
Cos we'Ve got a thing. La, la.

604
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,310
Not that, it's bigger.

605
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,154
# Nomothetic relationship

606
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,277
# It makes me sick, so Very sick

607
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:53,239
- # Your shining eyes like twisted wire
- (discord)

608
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:56,710
# On the coVer of a dirty magazine

609
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,156
# Mouth full of razor blades

610
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,949
# Tongue just like shining steel

611
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,235
- # You're making me ill
- (discord)

612
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:10,676
# On the coVer of a dirty magazine

613
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,796
(pretty melody)

614
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,677
(Matt) Snoop...

615
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:23,188
- I can do that bit. I can do the twiddly bit.
- (discordant crescendo)

616
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,238
That's, er, not good. But...

617
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,630
That, I mean, I thought that could be the big...

618
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,119
That's... great.

619
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:35,432
"Steel lll", it's called. "Steel III."
Still ill, "Steel lll". There's lots...

620
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,717
- But what's it got to do with the wedding?
- Shining.

621
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,839
Is that what you think I am?
I'm a girl on the coVer of a porno magazine?

622
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,434
With a steel tongue?
Is that what you're saying?

623
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,670
No, I'm not saying that. I'm saying, er...

624
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,116
(Matt) You're saying it's nomothetic?
Yeah, yeah, good idea.

625
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,873
- It makes me sick.
- Our relationship makes you sick?

626
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,359
- No, no.
- Well, Snoopy,

627
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,750
if you sing that song at our wedding,
that's what it sounds like.

628
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:03,834
I'm not. I'm saying everyone else's
relationship's normal, nomothetic. This is...

629
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:08,357
- There is no nomothetic!
- What does pedantic mean? That's the...

630
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:13,912
Snoopy, that's an interesting question,
but it's not the time to work it out here.

631
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,879
# You're dragging me down,
you're making me frown

632
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:21,839
# Saw you crying in your sleep

633
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,911
# Please don't cry

634
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:28,510
# What does pedantic mean?

635
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,632
- (Sam) Snoopy can do the lyrics...
- We're going to haVe...

636
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,713
Snoopy has a Vital part to play in this
wedding, there's no doubt about that.

637
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:41,157
He is Matt's best friend and he's
musically talented, and he's going to be there.

638
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,310
But this will be their dream wedding,

639
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,870
and I am prepared to kill or maim
for them to haVe that wedding.

640
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,313
Do you understand me?

641
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,190
- (Gregory) Out you come, my honey.
- (Archie) Bless, look at that.

642
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:00,637
Oh, she's looking a bit ragged, actually.
She didn't quite make the journey.

643
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:06,078
Now, which way are we round? We're all
moVing around now, it's like Dunsinane.

644
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,754
I like the idea.
Kind of Midsummer Night's Dream.

645
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:12,469
That kind of thing. Fairies,
Midsummer Night's Dream. They arriVe...

646
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,118
- Where's the couple?
- There.

647
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,475
I think they're hiding. They're hiding.

648
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,836
- Well, they're not going to be naked.
- Well, this is the problem.

649
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,592
It's tricky conVincing them.

650
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,593
I'm not interested in conVincing them.
This is what we need for our front coVer.

651
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,557
- We can't haVe nude people.
- ViVien.

652
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:31,349
They're not going to be on the front coVer
cos they're not gonna win.

653
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,034
- I think we all know that.
- Well, they may do.

654
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,599
Well, they may not.

655
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,319
Don't write them off
cos they'Ve got no clothes on.

656
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,473
What about haVing a little bush,
if you'll pardon the language,

657
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,676
a bush area that coVers the...

658
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:48,992
- Well, we had thought...
- A bush? How elegant is that going to be?

659
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:53,278
Well, if it's... If the topiary is done properly,
I think it could be rather loVely.

660
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:58,639
- Well, they're wearing...
- I gaVe you an agenda. Agenda is: No nudes.

661
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,596
To begin with, the dance is Very formal.

662
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:16,196
Then, more country.

663
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,794
(gasps) Suddenly, bright lights.

664
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,633
What's that rumble?
The rumble of something. What?

665
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,871
What it is is the arriVal of your camper Van.

666
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,315
And inside, you...

667
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,915
are the queen of the fairies.

668
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:38,518
Me, Oberon-like, as the king of the fairies,
emerge from the camper Van.

669
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:41,239
The green man guides them, comforts them.

670
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:45,836
And he is, of course,
our green man/registrar.

671
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,911
And you're married.

672
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,357
Well, I just think that completely sucks.
I mean, that whole thing is rubbish.

673
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,115
I mean, this is our wedding.
We can't be prancing around like berks.

674
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:03,398
We haVe a little problem here
that I think we ought to share with you.

675
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:07,473
That is that our brief, if you like,

676
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:11,758
is that your naturist wedding
must not be naked.

677
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,912
And that's come right from the top.

678
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,790
I really haVe to apologise.
I chose these people.

679
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:24,795
And it was after lunch, they were the best of
a bad lot, I'd had a couple of glasses of wine,

680
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,713
- and I think I'Ve made an error ofjudgment.
- All right.

681
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,268
OK, we just need
to deal with it now, yeah? OK.

682
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:33,477
- We just need to get them in a dress.
- We do. We absolutely do.

683
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,549
(knocking)

684
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,200
- (Antoni) loVely to see you.
- (Vivien) Come on in.

685
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,477
This gentleman is James Thursk.
He's our lawyer.

686
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:44,553
And he sorts things out. I believe
we'Ve got some sorting out to do today.

687
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,871
Yeah. Well, er, we'Ve been talking,

688
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:51,873
and the problem is that we were asked
for an idea for an original wedding,

689
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,155
and our idea was a naturist wedding,

690
00:41:54,240 --> 00:42:01,191
and we found out recently that this is going
to be a naturist wedding featuring no nudity.

691
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,918
Mr Thursk.

692
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,835
You can't really expect anyone to put naked
people on the coVer of a magazine if they win.

693
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,515
- I'm talking about our wedding.
- Don't put us on the coVer.

694
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:16,435
And as naturists, we know that you can't be
a bit naked. You're either naked or you're not.

695
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:19,159
You're not naked now,
you seem comfortable enough.

696
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:22,391
Is that some kind of challenge?
All right, fine.

697
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,072
- I don't think...
- Michael.

698
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,152
I hardly think it's appropriate...

699
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:30,437
- (Thursk) This isn't going to help.
- You're naked or you're not.

700
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:34,115
Stop it there, please.
We're trying to haVe a ciVilised discussion.

701
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,998
I'm haVing a ciVilised discussion.

702
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:40,914
I can still haVe a ciVilised
discussion whether I'm dressed or not.

703
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,389
He's becoming impossible to liVe with.

704
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:46,199
I'm going to stay here
until we write a new contract

705
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:49,636
that says that we can haVe the wedding
that you said that we can haVe.

706
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:53,713
I'Ve got to tell you now,
that's just not going to happen.

707
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:58,999
We cannot put out a magazine with people
in it naked. I'm sorry, we simply cannot do it.

708
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:01,230
- OK. Well, uh...
- That is the end of it.

709
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:06,519
- Yeah, I guess that is the end of it.
- What we do after that, Mr Collier...

710
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:14,636
Joanna, maybe if you just
wore a wedding dress...

711
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,029
I'm not even sure that I want to get married.

712
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:20,237
This is not what I dreamt of
since I was a little girl.

713
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:23,437
It is not becoming
what I wanted for a wedding.

714
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,556
He sleeps in the kitchen at the moment.

715
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:28,473
What if you dressed yourself up
to allure him?

716
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:32,838
Maybe you'Ve just been naked too much.
Maybe you'Ve become immune to each other.

717
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:35,957
Being so naked the whole time,
you'Ve got used to your bodies.

718
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,349
There's no sort of magic. James?

719
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:42,956
Yes. There's something
Very romantic about a wedding dress.

720
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:48,751
Well, if I can just start by simply explaining
why we're here and what it's all about.

721
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:54,119
We're here today to talk about
what it means to actually be getting married.

722
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,191
There's not really much to talk about.

723
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:00,637
I mean, you know, I felt that what we were
going to do was haVe a naturist wedding,

724
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:06,158
and that would inVolVe people
acting like naturists, aka being naked.

725
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,310
- It's AKA, not aka.
- And...

726
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:14,316
Apparently not everybody feels the same way.
Including the person I was hoping to marry.

727
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:20,111
I haVe expressed a... Notjust a
made-up problem, but a real issue with me,

728
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:23,431
is that being naked in front
of non-naturists is not as easy.

729
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,034
(Michael) I keep saying,
nobody's going to laugh.

730
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:30,318
Your body is the most eloquent expression
of how beautiful you are.

731
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,960
Get it into your thick head
how much I respect you.

732
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,953
If we take "thick" out for the moment,
there were some Very nice words there.

733
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,828
- (Joanna) Right.
- We can pop one out and put another one in.

734
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:45,391
- Let's take "thick" out then.
- Let's take "thick" out. Good. Good.

735
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:51,476
Could you, could you... Are you ready
to shuffle up a bit yet on the settee?

736
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:56,070
Well done. IoVely. OK.

737
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,273
# I was walking along, minding my business

738
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:10,955
# When out of an orange-coloured sky

739
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,998
# Flash! Bam! Alakazam!

740
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:17,910
# Wonderful you came by

741
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,675
# I was humming a tune, drinking in sunshine

742
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:25,389
# When out of an orange-coloured view

743
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:28,631
# Flash! Bam! Alakazam!

744
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,833
# I got a look at you

745
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:36,388
# One look and I yelled, "Timber!"

746
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,950
# Watch out for flying glass

747
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:43,430
# The ceiling fell in and the bottom fell out
I went into a spin and I started to shout

748
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,956
- # I've been hit
- # This is it, this is it, one, two, three

749
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:51,238
# I was walking along, minding my business

750
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:54,232
# And love came and hit me in the eye

751
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:58,071
# Flash! Bam! Alakazam!

752
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:02,358
# Out of an orange-coloured sky

753
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:05,557
The wedding planners
are not giVing us the same serVice.

754
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:09,030
They get a choreographer.
We're not allowed a choreographer.

755
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:10,678
- Next.
- Next point.

756
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:15,197
Well, she had a makeoVer at the wedding fair
before we made a fuss and I got Isabelle one.

757
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,477
- You did make a fuss.
- They're getting resources that we are not.

758
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:23,680
- They're getting... Is it rigged?
- Oh, please! Is it rigged? I mean...

759
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,320
- Just tell us, because we...
- Absolutely not.

760
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,109
Well, it doesn't seem like that
from where we're sitting.

761
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:34,751
I'm the chair of the judging panel,
I'Ve got the casting Vote. It will not be fixed.

762
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:37,798
- You haVe the casting Vote?
- Yes.

763
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:45,750
So what are you, uh, what do you w...
What are you looking for?

764
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,270
So, Isabelle. Let's haVe a look at your nose.

765
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:52,477
- Shall I...?
- Yes, please. Can you look in the mirror?

766
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,198
- OK. So...
- I loVe that nose.

767
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:57,716
What I see in your nose
is that the dorsum here,

768
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:01,475
the bridge, is a little bit too wide,
and too flat. OK?

769
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:05,997
The nose a little bit too short,
and is pointing up too much.

770
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:10,631
And when I look at you,
I see inside your nostrils.

771
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,790
And I personally don't like that.

772
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,193
Yeah? OK.

773
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:22,119
# I'Ve played tennis all oVer

774
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:28,115
# From Florida to Bosnia-HerzegoVa

775
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:32,756
HaVe to check what that country's called.
I don't think it's that.

776
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:36,799
# But I'Ve never met
a girl as beautiful as Isabelle

777
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:41,918
# More beautiful then Maria SharapoVa

778
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:47,919
# I felt like I was being
torn apart by the hounds of hell

779
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:53,509
# The day I fell in loVe with my Isabelle

780
00:47:55,640 --> 00:48:05,151
# Ohh...

781
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,031
# Isabelle

782
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:18,836
- That's really all I'Ve got at the moment.
- I just think that's beautiful.

783
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,114
Here we go. So, Voila.

784
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:33,478
That's your basic set, as it were.

785
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:35,710
- Er, your wedding area.
- Dark, innit?

786
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:38,439
Lt'll be lit. ObViously, it's notjust this dark.

787
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:42,195
Here, it's peopled with,
as you described to us before,

788
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:45,636
about maybe a little canopy of people.

789
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:49,349
- I don't know what you think...
- Itjust looks so dark, I don't like it.

790
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,954
- But it'll be lit.
- Is the floor going to be black?

791
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:55,749
- I'm saying, it'll be lit.
- You don't want black walls and a black floor.

792
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,831
These are star lights all around here.

793
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:58,909
- Do you?
- No.

794
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,389
- Star lights, like little stars.
- I don't care.

795
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:05,314
That's a black floor, and it's not right
for a wedding. That's my opinion.

796
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:09,279
It makes it easier for you
to stand out in whatever, in your white,

797
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:11,510
or what I thought was using a colour.

798
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:14,478
(mother) I just don't like the sound of it.
Well, carry on.

799
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:17,233
- Thank you. Cheers. Carry on.
- I don't like it at all.

800
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:18,469
- Matt.
- What if...

801
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:21,916
(Chris) Few flowers or something.
Iooks like a morgue.

802
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,834
- Flowers don't exist in this theme.
- (Matt) Yeah.

803
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,911
Busby Berkeley was not full of flowers.

804
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,357
- What are you doing?
- It's about angles. Geometrics. Art Deco.

805
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:34,908
Shapes, bodies of...
She's nodding. She knows.

806
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,797
What are the lights for?

807
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:39,952
The great thing about the spotlights
is we'll just see you,

808
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:43,555
- not people hanging around.
- What's the point in haVing people then?

809
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:47,792
Shut the fuck up! Seriously. Shut the fuck up.

810
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:50,189
- Matt, excuse me.
- Excuse nothing.

811
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:53,670
- I don't want language like that.
- No, we had this out yesterday.

812
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:57,435
- You shut up.
- I beg your pardon! Goodness me!

813
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:01,559
- Who the hell do you think you are?
- We're losing the wedding planners now.

814
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:05,235
- It's gone pear-shaped.
- It's not gone pear-shaped. You put it...

815
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:08,949
- Your fault. Not mine. Not Sam's. Not Jers.
- You put it pear-shaped.

816
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:12,510
You shouting like as though
you're on a barrow in a market.

817
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:15,831
If you want to come and see us,
you two, getting married, do.

818
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:19,515
But we don't need your sister
and your mother, it is not their wedding,

819
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:22,672
- and we won't do it.
- Sort your sister out. You sort her out.

820
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:26,150
- Can you leaVe my house, please?
- It would be an absolute joy.

821
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:29,437
This green is giVing me a headache.
Speaking of headaches...

822
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:32,159
Stop commenting on my house.

823
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:35,835
Oh, my godfathers, I tell you what.
I'Ve had it with you.

824
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,115
I'Ve had enough. I'Ve had enough.

825
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:40,475
- (Archie) Right. OK. Take care.
- Thank you.

826
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:45,429
- You need that house, so call us.
- I don't want to talk to her again.

827
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:48,671
(Matt) That makes two of us. Thanks a lot.

828
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:51,877
Thanks for coming oVer. Safe journey.

829
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:54,474
Well, that was a waste of time.
That's all we need.

830
00:50:54,560 --> 00:51:00,032
I'm only trying to help. I tell you what, you
might as well pack your fucking bags and go,

831
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:02,918
cos you'Ve really upset me this time,
I tell you what.

832
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,959
You won't apologise and repair it this time.
Bugger off.

833
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:13,074
(Sam) Matt's gone.
I don't know where he is.

834
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:16,709
He could be lying on a park bench
somewhere. He's gone because of you.

835
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,677
Cos of the way you behaVed yesterday.

836
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:22,036
Don't say you're worrying about him.
Not after the way he behaVed.

837
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:26,113
Shouting at your sister, shouting at me,
shouting in front of you.

838
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:28,475
Language like that? No.

839
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:31,199
He's shouting because
he can't stand it any more.

840
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,111
And I can't stand it any more.

841
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:36,431
Stand what any more, Sam?
Stand me and Mum trying to help?

842
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:41,389
Me coming back off a cruise, I'll do the
choreography, be in a dream ballet sequence.

843
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:44,950
I was so pleased when I heard
you were coming back from the cruise.

844
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:49,955
I was so excited to see you. And then
you come back and you just try and take oVer.

845
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:53,077
It's like you don't trust
that I can do it on my own.

846
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:58,188
I'Ve had to sit there and watch you and
clap you, with half a flamingo on your head,

847
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:02,193
Going, "Oh, look at Jen, look at Jen."
And it's my turn now.

848
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:05,829
I want to haVe a chance. I want to haVe
a chance. I want it to be me and Matt.

849
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:10,152
Me and Matt getting married, loVing each
other. Getting married in that spotlight.

850
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:15,314
GiVe me one day, just one chance,
to haVe my day, my wedding day,

851
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:20,190
and I want you to be there loVing me,
and supporting me.

852
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:23,556
Not making me feel like some idiot.

853
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:36,509
Hello.

854
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:39,398
(chirping)

855
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:42,199
(Archie) Morning, Matt. Are you well?

856
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,191
Cheers. Thanks a lot.

857
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:50,718
# Marriage is for old folks, old folks

858
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,995
# Not for me

859
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,757
# One husband, one wife
what do you got?

860
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:01,071
# Two people sentenced for life

861
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:07,829
You're not the first person to turn up here
before a wedding, freaking out.

862
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:12,152
No. You'Ve just got to accept
the fact that it's a stressful time,

863
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:17,394
take some time out and look after yourself
and look after her, and don't get so wound up.

864
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,835
You need a bit of me time.
That's what you need.

865
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:22,639
It's Very difficult. There's so much pressure.

866
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:27,396
- Particularly with this...
- (Sam singing "True Love")

867
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:32,594
What is that?

868
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:38,479
Jesus Christ! What are you...
What are you doing?

869
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:41,120
Stop it. St...

870
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,714
Sorry, I'd better go and...

871
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,109
(Archie laughing)

872
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:50,716
(Gregory) It's Julie. Julie Andrews.

873
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:53,519
Fly, my Romeo, fly.

874
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:58,190
He's coming down, he's coming down.

875
00:53:58,280 --> 00:53:59,633
Oh!

876
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,594
- Archie, look!
- Aw...

877
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:06,750
(Gregory) My loVebirds.

878
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:11,071
That's beautiful.

879
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,951
Oh, Archie.

880
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:34,718
# Summer breeze and blue, blue sky

881
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:38,315
# Memories of that beautiful delight

882
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,630
# Driving madly in the sun

883
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,234
# Playing games and having fun together

884
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:45,880
Just put something on, please.

885
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:49,077
I'm not gonna get dressed
just because your mother's coming.

886
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:51,549
- I'll haVe to go somewhere else.
- It's our room.

887
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:54,552
When I go to her house,
then I'll put some clothes on.

888
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:56,835
- Tubsy, darling.
- Mummy, hello.

889
00:54:56,920 --> 00:55:00,435
- How are you, sweetheart?
- Good, thank you. How are you?

890
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:03,910
I'm fine. What haVe they done to you, then?
Where haVe they put you?

891
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,355
- Oh, it's quite nice.
- It is nice.

892
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:10,638
Sweetheart, you're looking thinner.
Well done, that's excellent.

893
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:15,350
Right. Well, I'Ve had a long day,
so it's loVely to be here.

894
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,908
There you are, sweetie.

895
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,228
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.

896
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:25,668
Mrs Roberts. Well, I suppose now
I should call you Mum, really, shouldn't I?

897
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,876
- Erm...
- Pleasant trip?

898
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,838
Oh, my God.

899
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,911
Iook at them.

900
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:37,037
- That is ridiculous.
- We're fucked.

901
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:40,032
That is absolutely ridiculous.

902
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:49,473
'Ere, moVe oVer.
I'm almost on these chairs here.

903
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:51,516
You ready, Mum?

904
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:04,032
See, I don't know where Matt's coming from.
Is that him? Is that us, Jenny? Is this us?

905
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:08,716
- FiVe, six, seven, eight, go.
- Go.

906
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:18,319
Lower the arm.

907
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:24,750
- (mother) God.
- (Jen) What's he doing here?

908
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:27,354
(mother) Oh, no, I don't believe...

909
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:31,797
How come he knew about it? Who's been
talking to him, that's what I want to know.

910
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:36,078
- (Jen) Well, Matt obViously knew about it.
- I could haVe been warned.

911
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:40,597
You all right? Don't get upset, Mum, don't
get upset, cos then it's like he's winning.

912
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:43,399
All right, DaVe?

913
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,994
You never said.

914
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:49,470
I wasrt sure if he was gonna come,
but I'm glad. Shall we get on?

915
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:53,792
Well, it would haVe been nice if you could
haVe told me your dad was going to be here.

916
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,996
- Sorry.
- Is he going to be dancing?

917
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:57,798
- Yeah.
- No.

918
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:01,555
(Jenny) FiVe, six, seven, eight.
Up! Down! Up! Down!

919
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:03,756
- Up, two, three...
- Go!

920
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:07,469
(Jenny) One, two, three, four!

921
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:10,711
And run. Good, Very good. Perfect.

922
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:15,237
FiVe, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, four, fiVe, six, seven, eight.

923
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:17,709
- One, two...
- I'm sorry, but...

924
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,916
- (Matt) Keep going!
- One, two...

925
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,959
- He's too close to me.
- Up, two, three, four. And up...

926
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:28,989
- For God's sake, DaVe, do me a faVour.
...and oVer, and oVer.

927
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:32,595
- I'm trying my best.
- How can anyone be so insensitiVe?

928
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:35,717
- You punch me in the back of the head.
- I'm not Fred Astaire.

929
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:37,836
- Pushing me.
- I'm not Ginger Rogers.

930
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:41,390
And if you're not pushing me,
I can feel you making me lose me balance.

931
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:44,552
Chris, there's only a little bit of room.
We'Ve all got to...

932
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:49,589
All right. What I'm saying is, he's standing
right next to me, bish, bash, bosh.

933
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:52,433
- It's Very hard.
- I'm doing my best.

934
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:57,116
- We'Ve all got to try...
- If you were a bit more sensitiVe.

935
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:02,270
And...

936
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:07,477
- (Gregory) Hi.
- (Archie) Hi, guys.

937
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:10,836
What's happened?
What's happened to your face?

938
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:14,754
The nose job. The nose job.
This is just protecting it.

939
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:16,831
- It's next week!
- How long's it on for?

940
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:19,718
- It's gonna be fine.
- Don't worry about the timing.

941
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:24,476
We're not worried about this any more.
I'm only worried because I had to pay for it.

942
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:27,028
(Josef) Right. Cliff Richard?

943
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:29,509
- Very possibly.
- What do you mean, possibly?

944
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:32,751
He's out of the country,
but he said if he can get back, he will,

945
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:36,310
and if not he's got somebody he'll send
who is more like him than he is.

946
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,470
- So that's...
- Big ball? The big ball?

947
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:40,676
- We'Ve got you a big ball.
- Where is it?

948
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:42,671
- It's arriVing on the day.
- On the day?

949
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:46,389
- It's $1,000 a day.
- How many, erm, how many ball boys?

950
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:49,119
- Six.
- Or possibly even eight.

951
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,997
Choreographer?

952
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:54,038
We're still talking to her,
we're still talking to her.

953
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:56,839
It's just that we'Ve got so many weddings...

954
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:59,832
If we can get a shape, right?

955
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:02,992
We haVert really got the budget
for a choreographer, but...

956
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:07,392
listen to me. If we can get a shape to it,
on the day we can get her in, hopefully,

957
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:11,109
we're talking to her, we can get her in,
and she can tidy it up at the end.

958
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:13,555
She's busy with 42 dancers
in the other wedding.

959
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:16,552
She is the choreographer,
and the choreographer...

960
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:18,278
- Choreographs.
- Dance pieces.

961
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:19,998
And proVides ideas.

962
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:21,638
- Yes, but...
- ProVide ideas.

963
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:24,553
No, no, that's what couples do
who want to get married.

964
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:27,518
- We haVe giVen our ideas!
- Where haVe your ideas been?

965
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:30,114
- We gaVe you ideas.
- We wanted ball boys,

966
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:33,556
we wanted you to arriVe at a net,
we wanted you in Edwardian clothes,

967
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:37,428
- and everything was thrown out.
- No, you didn't. When haVe... What...

968
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:40,193
We came to you at your club and said:

969
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:43,192
"Entrance of ball boys
to prepare your arena for you."

970
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:46,750
It's not our fault that you don't
haVe enough friends to bring along

971
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:48,637
who can do these things for you.

972
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:50,711
- Fuck you!
- Oh, no, please...

973
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:53,360
- No, we haVe friends!
- Well, where are they?

974
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:56,113
Fuck off about the friends.
This is not about friends.

975
00:59:56,200 --> 01:00:00,512
- Of course it is. On the day, we need people...
- They can't make it.

976
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:03,239
Her family are from Canada.
Know how far away that is?

977
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:08,189
We can't afford it cos we'Ve
had to spend all our money on her nose.

978
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:14,311
Thanks Very much.

979
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:20,995
Oh, Arch, come on, don't be silly.
Come on, don't be silly.

980
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:25,198
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, come on. It's not your fault.

981
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:28,431
I don't like him shouting...

982
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:30,954
Oh, come here. Come here.

983
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:34,396
You silly sausage. Silly sausage.

984
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,755
It's not your fault though.

985
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:46,039
Come on, my big bear.
Don't be silly. Come on.

986
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:48,111
Don't be silly.

987
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:51,239
(door opens)

988
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:56,189
Oh, they're coming back.
Come on, don't let them see you like this.

989
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:58,953
Why not?
They just think I'm a stupid puff anyway.

990
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:02,350
Don't be stupid.
I'm the puff, you're the straight man.

991
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:04,431
Don't be silly.

992
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,709
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK now.

993
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:22,596
I just wonder how long
before she gets sick of me, really.

994
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:25,591
Before she, um...

995
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:31,912
You know. Especially if we don't win the
competition, I'Ve got nothing to offer her.

996
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,436
I'm at the end of my tennis career, and...

997
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:38,432
- OK.
...l'Ve got no money,

998
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:42,638
and I don't know whether,
you know, whether in a year's time

999
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:45,518
she'll still want to be married,

1000
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:50,116
you know, if I haVert
proVided anything good for her,

1001
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:53,351
or, you know,
if I'm not winning any tennis matches.

1002
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:58,195
They're under huge pressure,
these, you know, these people,

1003
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:02,273
to sort of haVe the perfect wedding,
and they...

1004
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:06,716
So it's natural that they should
take that out on us a bit, I suppose.

1005
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:12,397
You know, if we don't like it,
then we wouldn't be doing it, would we?

1006
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:16,429
- You're tired, aren't you?
- Sorry?

1007
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:21,913
- You're just tired. He's just tired.
- No, I'm not tired. I'm fine.

1008
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:26,869
Tell Mr Rusedski to ring me,
I won't ring again.

1009
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:30,475
The wedding's really soon.
He wanted to come. OK?

1010
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:34,519
Josef Worrell, you haVe my number.
Thank you.

1011
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:49,431
Do you like it?

1012
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:53,429
Yeah.

1013
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:56,318
- You don't.
- I do.

1014
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,868
Why are you crying? Don't cry.

1015
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:02,157
- It's good?
- No, I do, I like it. Don't cry.

1016
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:03,958
It's OK. I like it. I loVe it.

1017
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:05,314
- You do?
- Yeah.

1018
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:08,631
- It's just a bit of a shock.
- Do you want to see it from the side?

1019
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,711
- OK.
- OK.

1020
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:24,709
Hey. You look gorgeous.

1021
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:27,314
- (woman) All right?
- All right? I'm tremendous.

1022
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:30,358
(Gregory) Terribly exciting, isn't it?

1023
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:34,589
How can that nose go on a front coVer?

1024
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:38,150
I didn't say it specifically,
but I implied "change it for the better".

1025
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:39,559
Well, it wasrt, was it?

1026
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:41,756
- It's ever so subtle.
- I know.

1027
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:43,831
- (whispers) It's out here.
- I know.

1028
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:46,559
It looks like it's been broken and then reset.

1029
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:49,200
Is that the mother oVer there?

1030
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:54,400
- She's not going to be naked, is she?
- No.

1031
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:56,038
No one wants to see that.

1032
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:58,554
- Who's that?
- (Vivien) That's her sister.

1033
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,392
Sister of who?

1034
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:02,835
- Really?
- Yeah.

1035
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:06,674
- Are you insisting that they wear clothes?
- I think it would be better.

1036
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:11,072
I too. I couldn't agree with you more.
Now let's just stop the silly stuff, shall we?

1037
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:14,554
Thanks.

1038
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:17,154
"Looking at the View"?
I'Ve heard that one before.

1039
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:19,390
- Mum!
- I werert born yesterday.

1040
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:23,473
Do you think Jen would be that cheap
to go upstairs with a stranger and haVe sex?

1041
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:26,438
- Mum, excuse me, we was talking.
- I mean, she's...

1042
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:28,476
This is my little girl here.

1043
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:33,076
I can assure you, sir,
that nothing happened... ViVien? ViVien?

1044
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:37,678
- Er, so, here's to a wonderful day.
- (Antoni) Here's to Confetti.

1045
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:39,751
(all) Cheers!

1046
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:07,478
Oh, look, look.
Somebody's set this right-handed.

1047
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:12,111
No, but it's good. It's good.

1048
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:15,988
It's loVely, it's loVely.
It's just detail, it's just detail.

1049
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:18,548
- Start getting ready now.
- I am getting ready.

1050
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:20,392
- All right.
- Look, what's this?

1051
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:24,951
I know. They need to come out,
you need to be... Go see Marella now.

1052
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:30,990
- Is everybody all right?
- (all) Yeah.

1053
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:35,551
- OK, I think a few people haVe disappeared.
- They'Ve just gone to the loo.

1054
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:39,110
Please just make it a loo run
and nothing else. All right?

1055
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:43,159
- You look absolutely fabulous. Smashing.
- (all) Thank you.

1056
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:45,037
- So do you.
- Thank you Very much.

1057
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:49,591
Can't say I hope you win, cos I don't.
But anyway, good luck. Hope it goes well.

1058
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:52,240
- Yeah, I hope yours goes well. Really do.
- Thanks.

1059
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:54,356
Is everything all right? No panic?

1060
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:56,476
- No. It's loVely.
- Is it?

1061
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:59,154
- I'm worried...
- What are you talking about?

1062
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:02,550
- I just don't know if I can do it, I mean...
- Hey, hey, no, no, no.

1063
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:06,030
- Just cos of the singing...
- (Snoopy) You'll be fine, darling.

1064
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:08,634
Sam, listen to me. Listen to me. Breathe.

1065
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:11,393
- Your singing is...
- I think I'm going to be sick.

1066
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:13,948
- Sam, do you want me to come?
- I feel sick.

1067
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:17,476
- Sam?
- (Snoopy) Keep her hair away from her face.

1068
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:20,120
- OK.
- OtheRWise you get sick on the hair.

1069
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:23,590
If it's something different,
something you like, and you think:

1070
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:28,754
"Well, I haVert seen this before." That's not...
Regardless of whether you like it or not.

1071
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:32,230
If you hate it, step back and say,
"Original, but I didn't like it."

1072
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:39,717
Just popped by to say, on behalf of Confetti
magazine, the best of British. All right?

1073
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:44,078
- (Michael) Thanks.
- And I think you'Ve got a Very strong chance.

1074
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:46,833
- (Joanna) Thank you. That's Very nice.
- Smashing.

1075
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:50,276
Lf, erm... Yes, if you keep your clothes on.

1076
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:52,351
See you later.

1077
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:58,148
What I'm about to say now
is not meant as a criticism, I swear to you.

1078
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:00,913
But you know you're sort of
painted brown, some of...

1079
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,470
It's just, like, there's a line,
and I don't know if...

1080
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:07,199
If you want to change it...
maybe you didn't notice it.

1081
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:10,875
But I know you're a perfectionist,
I thought you might want to change it.

1082
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:14,748
- Cos you're a perfectionist...
- What do you mean?

1083
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:18,150
- I'Ve fake tanned it, I'Ve just, like, done it...
- I know, but...

1084
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:22,631
Yeah, but you don't get brown palms when
you sunbathe. You don't sunbathe like that.

1085
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:25,188
But not everyone
looks like Biffo the Bear.

1086
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:28,636
Cos I mean, like, there's a sort of brown,
and there's a white...

1087
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:30,790
We haVe to win. We haVe to win.

1088
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:34,475
So we will win. We will win. Come on, Josef.

1089
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:38,074
Come on. Do you want to go through it?

1090
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:39,354
Wha...

1091
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:42,635
- What if we lose?
- We're not gonna lose.

1092
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:45,029
- Why? How do we know?
- Because we're winners!

1093
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:47,156
We are winners. We're gonna win this.

1094
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:48,878
They'll kill us out there.

1095
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:54,472
I'm sure you'll all agree with me
when I say marriage is about commitment,

1096
01:07:54,560 --> 01:08:00,192
and we at Confetti magazine are committed
to pushing the enVelope in weddings.

1097
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:04,478
Today is about new and exciting weddings,
things that you haVert seen before.

1098
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:07,552
I know the couples are backstage now,
I know you can hear me.

1099
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:11,553
Do remember, the work is over now,
everything is prepared.

1100
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:17,397
So just relax, take a breath,
and get ready to enjoy yourselves.

1101
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:21,508
Let's moVe on to our first wedding,
I think it's taking place oVer here.

1102
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:25,593
You can probably guess the theme.
Ladies and gentlemen, Confetti giVes you:

1103
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:31,118
- Josef and Isabelle.
- (# "Light and Tuneful" by Keith Mansfield)

1104
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:48,110
(man) Welcome to Wimbledon
on this absolutely glorious summer's day.

1105
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:52,910
There's a palpable sense of excitement
here amongst this full house.

1106
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,992
A real buzz around centre court.

1107
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:04,634
This really does promise
to be the most wonderful occasion.

1108
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:10,909
- (music stops)
- (applause)

1109
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:21,675
Oh, and here they are! Here they come!
I say!

1110
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:24,513
# What a day this has been

1111
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:26,909
# What a rare mood I'm in

1112
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:31,676
# Why, it's almost like being in love

1113
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:34,918
# And there's this smile on my face

1114
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,309
# For the whole human race

1115
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:41,598
- # Why, it's almost like being in love
- (crowd) Aw!

1116
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:44,838
# And all the music of life

1117
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:47,753
# Seems to be

1118
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:51,948
- Who's going to call?
- I will.

1119
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:55,196
Heads.

1120
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:57,589
- I'm sorry, it's tails.
- I'll serVe.

1121
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:03,029
Josef Cecil Worrell
has won the toss and elected to serVe.

1122
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:05,190
(applause)

1123
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:10,270
Quiet, please.

1124
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:12,237
- Play.
- (tennis ball noise)

1125
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:16,279
I, Josef Cecil Worrell, know of no legal reason

1126
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:19,511
why I may not be married
to Isabelle Frances Fontaine.

1127
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:21,318
- 15-loVe.
- (tennis ball noise)

1128
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:23,277
I, Isabelle Frances Fontaine,

1129
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:26,796
know of no legal reason why
I cannot be married to Josef Cecil Worrell.

1130
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:28,359
- 15-all.
- (tennis ball noise)

1131
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:32,831
I, Josef Cecil Worrell,

1132
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:34,638

1133
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:36,438
- 30-15.

1134
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:41,878
I, Isabelle Frances Fontaine, take you, Josef

1135
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:44,030
30-all. New balls, please.

1136
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:51,230
Isabelle...

1137
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:54,714
I'Ve never won a tournament,

1138
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:58,315
but I don't care, because I'Ve won you.

1139
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:01,113
(registrar) 40-30.

1140
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:06,354
I know it's not been possible
to haVe any friends or family here today,

1141
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:11,594
but that doesn't matter, cos you're here,
and that's all I'll need now and for ever.

1142
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:13,432
(registrar) Deuce.

1143
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:17,559
Isabelle, I can't promise
I'll never be jealous again,

1144
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:24,113
but I can promise that I'll look after you,
and loVe you, till the day I die.

1145
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:26,509
# Love is in the air

1146
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:31,197
# Love is in the air

1147
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:34,511
Josef Cecil Worrell,
Isabelle Frances Fontaine,

1148
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:36,750
it giVes me great pleasure to pronounce...

1149
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:38,990
(thunder)

1150
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:45,349
(man) Well, what a shame.
Covers are going on.

1151
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:49,793
Looks like a passing shower,
so hopefully it'll not...

1152
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:53,555
What's this? Someone's standing up.

1153
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:57,599
It's Cliff Richard! Oh, my goodness.

1154
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:01,798
He's going to sing!
What a privilege to be here.

1155
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:04,474
# I got myself a crying, talking

1156
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:08,553
# Sleeping, walking, liVing doll

1157
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:11,234
# I'Ve got to do my best to please her

1158
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:14,869
# Just cos she's my liVing doll

1159
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:17,838
# I'Ve got a roVing eye and that is

1160
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:21,276
# Why she satisfies my soul

1161
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:25,829
# I got my one and only walking, talking

1162
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:28,115
# liVing doll

1163
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:38,191
# Love is in the air

1164
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:43,032
# Love is in the air

1165
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:45,350
# Oh, oh

1166
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:48,671
(registrar) Game, set, and match.

1167
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:57,234
# Oh, love is in the air

1168
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:02,318
- You could try a bit harder.
- I am! But this isn't what we wanted to do.

1169
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:06,109
I'Ve had everybody telling us
what we haVe to do, sticking stuff on us.

1170
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:08,589
I'Ve got leaVes in places I didn't know existed.

1171
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:10,910
How do you think I feel?
They'Ve done it to me.

1172
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:14,037
Well, ladies and gentlemen,
as if that wasrt a treat enough,

1173
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:17,317
and I think it really was,
we'Ve three weddings to get through,

1174
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:20,039
and I can scarcely believe it,
we're onto our second.

1175
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:23,476
This one's Very interesting.
I loVe it, I loVe the concept.

1176
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:25,869
I'Ve not seen anything yet, but I loVe the idea.

1177
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:30,511
Ladies and gentlemen,
I giVe you Michael and Joanna.

1178
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:49,114
# I lay before you

1179
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:52,909
# All I haVe to offer

1180
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:58,516
# King of my heart

1181
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:04,109
# I need to know you

1182
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:08,352
# And I need to loVe you

1183
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:14,117
# Oh, king of my heart

1184
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:18,675
# And you're king, and you're king

1185
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:22,634
# And you're king, and you're king

1186
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:28,192
# So I'm queen when you're king in my heart

1187
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:33,674
# And it's loVe, and it's loVe

1188
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:37,355
# That I lay at your feet

1189
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:39,670
# At your feet

1190
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:43,036
# King of my heart

1191
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:47,190
# I loVe you

1192
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:50,955
# King of my heart

1193
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:54,430
# How I loVe you

1194
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:59,116
# King of my heart

1195
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:13,876
Oh, Tubs.

1196
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:18,349
I Vow to never make you coVer up
for shame or fear or duty.

1197
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:21,750
You'll never need to shed your clothes
for me to see your beauty.

1198
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:25,037
I won't ignore our differences,
but let them just connect.

1199
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:28,874
(Michael) One word for that is compromise,
a better one's respect.

1200
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:33,192
They droVe you mad, but do not fear,
for now you haVe a wife.

1201
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:38,115
Your husband's here, screw them, my dear,
their wedding but our life.

1202
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:42,398
You join the dots between the stars
like a pen of heaVers manna.

1203
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:47,031
You make two houses into one.
You join me up, Joanna.

1204
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:51,272
You're like an angel oVerhead,
but with me on a cycle.

1205
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:55,956
Come liVe with me and be my loVe,
my Gabriel, my Michael.

1206
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:08,310
Ladies and gentlemen,
now that Michael and Joanna

1207
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:12,871
haVe exchanged head rings
and promised themselVes to each other,

1208
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:18,080
the solemn moment has come for
the couple to make their marriage contract.

1209
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:20,276
If you'll please all stand.

1210
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:30,837
I call upon these persons here present
to witness that I, Michael Gabriel Collier...

1211
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:35,835
I call upon these persons here present
to witness that I, Michael Gabriel Collier,

1212
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:40,471
do take thee, Joanna Martha Roberts,
to be my lawful wedded wife.

1213
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:45,998
I call upon these persons here present
to witness that I, Joanna Martha Roberts,

1214
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:51,438
do take thee, Michael Gabriel Collier,
to be my lawful wedded husband.

1215
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:56,674
It giVes me great pleasure to pronounce
you man and wife. You may kiss the bride.

1216
01:16:57,880 --> 01:16:59,677
(cheers and applause)

1217
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:04,911
(bicycle bell)

1218
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,791
Whoo-hoo!

1219
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:29,311
Well, ladies and gentlemen,
that was Michael and Joanna.

1220
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:34,554
And I think we can all... Well, let's raise
our glasses to them, the happy couple.

1221
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:39,077
Michael and Joanna.
What a wonderful, wonderful thing.

1222
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:43,313
Listen, everyone, we're not going
to worry about the steps, or the tune,

1223
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:47,757
we're just going to haVe fun, all right? None
of us are singers, none of us are dancers.

1224
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:51,071
- (Jen) Well, I...
- I'm nerVous of forgetting that bit.

1225
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:53,151
But do you know what? It doesn't matter.

1226
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:56,949
When we went through it I got it all wrong,
I thought, "I'Ve let you down."

1227
01:17:57,040 --> 01:18:00,828
Girls, girls, this is stage fright.
I'Ve seen it a thousand times.

1228
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:03,480
- I don't want to let you down.
- Calm. Deep breaths.

1229
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:07,109
This is going to be fabulous.
We're going to do a wonderful show.

1230
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:09,998
For once in your life, Jen, I think you're right.

1231
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:13,277
(Antoni) I want you to giVe the warm
reception you gaVe the others

1232
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:17,717
to our final couple. It is Matt and Sam.

1233
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:19,559
Right! Yeah!

1234
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:24,197
- I loVe you.
- I loVe you, too. Right.

1235
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:33,510
(fanfare)

1236
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:53,553
# A beautiful girl makes the world

1237
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:58,236
# A beautiful place

1238
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:02,868
# Nothing compares to her effortless style

1239
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:05,679
# And grace

1240
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:09,912
# Her smile lights up a room

1241
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:14,676
# Her Voice is a loVely tune

1242
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:16,591
# The way she walks

1243
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:18,636
# Her hair, her eyes

1244
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:22,349
# And her fabulous face

1245
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:26,149
# Yes, a beautiful girl makes the world

1246
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:29,869
# A beautiful place

1247
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:14,829
How are you two?
Matthew Norris, Samantha Whiston.

1248
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:17,229
Marriage,
according to the law of this country,

1249
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:20,232
is the union of one man and one woman,

1250
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:26,395
Voluntarily entered into for life,
to the exclusion of all others.

1251
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:29,071
Now, ladies and gentlemen,

1252
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:32,835
Matthew and Samantha
are going to make their marriage Vows

1253
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:34,751
through the medium of song.

1254
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:46,870
(in unison) # I promise to loVe you

1255
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:54,514
# I promise to care for you

1256
01:20:54,600 --> 01:21:02,154
# I promise to always make you

1257
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:05,516
(sweet harmony) # laugh

1258
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:13,552
(solo) # I giVe you my loVe

1259
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:16,677
# Always

1260
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:20,833
# To haVe and to hold

1261
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:24,435
# Always

1262
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:28,115
# Our life to unfold

1263
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:30,555
(both) # As man and

1264
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:34,599
(harmony) # Wife

1265
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:38,195
# Always

1266
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:42,188
# Always

1267
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:44,919
(strings play crescendo)

1268
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:54,193
- # I giVe you my loVe for always
- # I promise to loVe you

1269
01:21:54,280 --> 01:22:02,119
- # To haVe and to hold always
- # I promise to care for you

1270
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:12,678
- # Our life to unfold as man and wife
- # I promise to make you laugh

1271
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:17,472
- (both) # Always
- # Ah

1272
01:22:17,560 --> 01:22:24,113
# Always

1273
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:30,635
# I do

1274
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:35,314
# Me too

1275
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:41,913
(cheers and applause)

1276
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:12,670
- (music stops)
- (audience cheering)

1277
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:21,068
(Antoni) Once again, thank you so much
for sharing this day with us.

1278
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:24,072
It's been so wonderful for us,
it's been really good of you

1279
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:29,393
to open up your most precious day to
our magazine, Confetti. Thank you so much.

1280
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:35,673
Smile, look like we're winners. They
won't giVe it to us if we look like losers.

1281
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:40,356
Right. First off, let's go through
couple by couple, couple by couple.

1282
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:43,349
The judge in the green suit seems to be a fan.

1283
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:46,910
- He was loVely, wasrt he?
- He keeps saying, "Well done."

1284
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,514
- Just wanted to say congratulations.
- Thanks.

1285
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:52,194
- Good luck.
- Congratulations.

1286
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:53,269
Yeah.

1287
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:55,954
- (Sam) We'll haVe a drink later.
- Yeah.

1288
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:58,473
They are so two-faced.

1289
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:01,279
Think about innoVation.
It was really innoVatiVe.

1290
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:06,388
- (Antoni) Well, let's all put down a score.
- Original. In that you wouldn't do it again.

1291
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:10,473
- You look so beautiful. You absolutely do.
- So do you.

1292
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:15,509
You'Ve got a great body.
I had to tell him to stop looking at your bum.

1293
01:25:15,560 --> 01:25:17,790
- They know they'Ve won, that's why...
- They don't. They haVe not won.

1294
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:22,593
They haVe not necessarily won.
We could still win. For God's sake.

1295
01:25:24,680 --> 01:25:27,956
Ladies and gentlemen,
if I could haVe your attention, please.

1296
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:31,191
The judging panel haVe reached a Verdict.

1297
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:34,875
And ViVien, the editor of the magazine,
has the golden enVelope,

1298
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:39,192
and it would be churlish not to let her do
the honours, she's done so much of the work.

1299
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:41,919
So, ViVien, oVer to you.

1300
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:45,673
OK. And the winner is...

1301
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:48,638
(drum roll)

1302
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:54,917
Yes!

1303
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,309
Matt and Sam!

1304
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:38,873
Fix! It's a fix!

1305
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:42,032
- (Antoni) No, I think not really the time...
- It's a fix!

1306
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:44,998
Josef, it is not the time. Don't be a bad loser.

1307
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:47,116
- It's a fix.
- It's not a tennis match.

1308
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:51,193
- Donkey! Bring it on.
- It was a fair and square competition.

1309
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:55,717
I object to that in the strongest possible
terms. Let Matt and Sam haVe their moment.

1310
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:58,872
Round of applause for Matt and Sam.

1311
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:05,910
Now, I'Ve got the key, I'Ve got the key
to a half a million pound house

1312
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:10,596
for Matt and Sam, our winners,
winning fair and square.

1313
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:20,959
# HeaVen

1314
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:24,396
# I'm in heaVen

1315
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:30,191
# And my heart beats
so that I can hardly speak

1316
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:36,991
# And I seem to find the happiness I seek

1317
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:43,917
# When we're out together
dancing cheek to cheek

1318
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:48,480
# HeaVen

1319
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:51,916
# I'm in heaVen

1320
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:56,915
# And the cares that hung around me
through the week

1321
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:03,918
# Seem to Vanish like a gambler's lucky streak

1322
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:10,918
# When we're out together
dancing cheek to cheek

1323
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:13,718
(screaming guitar)

1324
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:22,956
# Oh, I'd loVe to climb a mountain

1325
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:25,713
# Reach the highest peak

1326
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:28,712
# But it doesn't thrill me half as much

1327
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:31,519
# As dancing cheek to cheek

1328
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:34,558
(church bells ring out)

1329
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:39,077
Since that competition, I'Ve trusted
my intuition. I'Ve trusted in my dreams.

1330
01:28:39,160 --> 01:28:42,436
Because you haVe an idea like that,
and it's that big a success,

1331
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:47,071
you think, "Well, just trust
in yourself and go for it."

1332
01:28:47,160 --> 01:28:51,438
So what I'Ve done is take some of the profit
from that competition, the success of it,

1333
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:53,988
and I'Ve inVested it in music.

1334
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:57,593
Notjust a couple of CDs.
I'Ve bought a record label.

1335
01:28:57,680 --> 01:28:59,750
And, you know, doing some A&R.

1336
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:01,671
(# cheesy pop)

1337
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:03,796
# One looks for happiness

1338
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:05,996
# One longs to find a partner

1339
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:08,150
# One knows that nowadays

1340
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:10,071
# One loVe will be the answer

1341
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:14,593
(Matt) Oh, please, God, you know,
the deeds are gonna come through soon.

1342
01:29:14,680 --> 01:29:18,434
They'Ve told us, haVert they, not to worry.
It's all all right, it's OK.

1343
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:23,230
But of course you never actually can believe
it until you're there, in your new home.

1344
01:29:23,320 --> 01:29:26,835
- So, we're keeping our fingers crossed.
- Yeah.

1345
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:29,031
- # One loVe
- (band) # One loVe

1346
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:31,395
- # Only one
- # Only one

1347
01:29:31,480 --> 01:29:33,118
- # One loVe
- # One loVe

1348
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:36,078
I would say to anyone
thinking of getting married, do it,

1349
01:29:36,160 --> 01:29:39,835
if you are doing it for the reason
that you just loVe the other person.

1350
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:43,879
# One loVe while we're still liVing

1351
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:47,589
I went into a bit of a decline
after the weddings.

1352
01:29:47,680 --> 01:29:50,240
- Post-nuptial depression.
- In bed for four weeks.

1353
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:51,878
Hit him pretty hard.

1354
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:56,397
- (Josef) But we're over that. I'm coaching.
- He's fantastic with children.

1355
01:29:56,480 --> 01:30:00,268
The forehand is this, there, there, there.
Got it? Right. Go away.

1356
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:02,794
(Isabelle) We're thinking
about one of our own.

1357
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:05,235
Who knows what, er...

1358
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:09,670
nose they'll... get.

1359
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:11,796
- # One nose
- (band) # One loVe

1360
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:14,189
- # And only one
- # Only one

1361
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:15,918
- # One nose
- # One loVe

1362
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,309
# And no misgiVings

1363
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:20,356
- # One loVe
- # One loVe

1364
01:30:20,440 --> 01:30:22,908
- # Only one loVe
- # One loVe

1365
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:26,675
# One loVe while we're still liVing

1366
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:28,557
Mainly, we'Ve just sort of found out

1367
01:30:28,640 --> 01:30:32,394
that the only people we really need
to be naked in front of is each other.

1368
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:35,995
We don't call ourselVes naturists any more.
We call ourselVes...

1369
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:38,719
- Well, I call myself Michael.
- And I'm Joanna.

1370
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:43,396
- And, er, yeah. That seems to work better.
- Better, I think.

1371
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:44,993
- # One loVe
- (band) # One loVe

1372
01:30:45,080 --> 01:30:47,435
# Only one loo-oo-oVe

1373
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:50,557
# One loVe while we're still liVing

1374
01:30:52,720 --> 01:30:55,280
- Erm...
- You're not doing this, are you?

1375
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:59,273
- Are you... Are you really doing this?
- Shh, be quiet. This is my bit.

1376
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:02,397
Er, Gregory Hough, erm... I...

1377
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:04,471
Will you marry me?

1378
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:09,510
Is that the right hand?

1379
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:11,477
It's actually...

1380
01:31:11,560 --> 01:31:13,312
- # One loVe
- (band) # One loVe

1381
01:31:13,400 --> 01:31:15,789
- # Only one loVe
- # One loVe

1382
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:18,678
# One loVe while we're still liVing

1383
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:20,637
One loVe.

1384
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:22,438
Peace.

1385
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:26,638
Don't stand around on the edges of other
people's weddings crying at pretty brides

1386
01:31:26,720 --> 01:31:31,919
and thinking, "Oh, wouldn't it be nice if...?"
If you see what you want, go and get it.

1387
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,514
So that's what we're doing.
And you should too.

1388
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:37,990
Heron and Hough, your dreams are enough.

1389
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,956
# One love with no misgivings

1390
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:50,158
# One love, only one love

1391
01:31:50,240 --> 01:31:53,391
# One love while we're still living

1392
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:57,394
- You were great.
- Well, you were.

01:31:58,715 --> 01:32:08,715
