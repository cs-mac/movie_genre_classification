00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:07,176
Episode 13

2
00:02:12,204 --> 00:02:15,410
Ahh...

3
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:23,299
Why are you hitting me?

4
00:02:24,531 --> 00:02:25,640
Park Tae-In?

5
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:28,395
It's me! Who do you think it is?

6
00:02:28,396 --> 00:02:29,802
Oh...

7
00:02:30,388 --> 00:02:32,380
I thought you were a thief!

8
00:02:33,645 --> 00:02:34,547
What did you say?

9
00:02:38,356 --> 00:02:39,529
Why are you here?

10
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,521
How come you're not answering your phone?

11
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,690
You came here just to ask that?

12
00:02:43,691 --> 00:02:47,499
I'm not here just to ask about that. I was worried about you.

13
00:02:48,243 --> 00:02:50,195
But why are you dressed up like a thief?

14
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,511
Why do you still come when you're not feeling well?

15
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:59,232
Who asked you not to answer your phone?

16
00:03:01,064 --> 00:03:03,952
I didn't bring it with me that's why I couldn't answer.

17
00:03:03,953 --> 00:03:05,593
Really forgetful.

18
00:03:05,967 --> 00:03:11,981
Go back and rest after taking your medicine. You're already sick. What if it gets worse?

19
00:03:11,982 --> 00:03:14,488
- Hey!
- Why?

20
00:03:14,497 --> 00:03:16,460
It can't be like that...

21
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:17,920
What is it?

22
00:03:17,965 --> 00:03:25,578
I'm sick and I'm feeling hungry. Besides... the weather is cold.

23
00:03:26,233 --> 00:03:26,796
What?

24
00:03:28,487 --> 00:03:29,769
I'm hungry...

25
00:03:36,274 --> 00:03:36,978
Come in.

26
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:51,321
Do you have to come here only when we're out of rice? I feel sorry to be cooking only ramen for you.

27
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,562
- Can I sleep here tonight?
- What?

28
00:03:58,194 --> 00:04:06,750
I don't want to stay home alone. Now that I'm sick... It's harder to stay home alone.

29
00:04:07,688 --> 00:04:09,856
Yesterday I dreamt about Ji Hyun-Woo.

30
00:04:11,028 --> 00:04:12,201
Was it a nightmare?

31
00:04:13,718 --> 00:04:15,131
My heart almost fell.

32
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:29,944
- Cold?
- Yes.

33
00:04:38,955 --> 00:04:43,409
I've put the hot blanket on top of the bed. Go inside and sleep after you finish eating.

34
00:04:58,542 --> 00:05:02,515
Don't ride on the motorcycle anymore. It's dangerous and easy to fall sick.

35
00:05:19,084 --> 00:05:22,588
{\a6}* noona = older sister

36
00:05:19,084 --> 00:05:22,588
- Noona...
- Yes... Why?

37
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,850
That... Noona...?

38
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,865
Why?  Say it...

39
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:37,694
Noona, the reason you were against Bo-Ri...

40
00:05:37,695 --> 00:05:41,445
Why do you always talk about Teacher Na Bo-Ri?

41
00:05:42,117 --> 00:05:43,828
Was it because of the school?

42
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:49,130
Is it because I can't manage the school after marrying Bo-Ri?

43
00:05:49,298 --> 00:05:52,101
You want to give our school to someone else?

44
00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:55,335
Other than us, who would want take over the school?

45
00:05:55,628 --> 00:05:58,910
I'm older than you, you should know how to weigh this.

46
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:02,895
At least, your wife has to know how to manage.

47
00:06:05,328 --> 00:06:07,731
- Pass it to me.
- What?

48
00:06:07,732 --> 00:06:11,130
I will take over the school. Just agree to my marriage with Bo-Ri.

49
00:06:13,595 --> 00:06:14,120
What?

50
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:18,456
You're a person who really knows how to joke.

51
00:06:19,146 --> 00:06:21,386
You know how to manage the school?

52
00:06:21,387 --> 00:06:25,605
If you had known how to manage the school in the beginning... I wouldn't have had to take over.

53
00:06:27,473 --> 00:06:32,242
A person who only knows how to paint, how can he manage a school?

54
00:06:32,687 --> 00:06:33,942
Just learn it!

55
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:37,927
Bo-Ri and I will study overseas... We'll come back after 3 years.

56
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:41,795
For the time being, you will have to manage the school.

57
00:06:42,521 --> 00:06:44,188
I will take over the school when I come back with Bo-Ri.

58
00:06:45,634 --> 00:06:48,809
Eun-Seong is not our family member...

59
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,843
There's no need for Eun-Seong to manage it. I'll do it myself.

60
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:58,410
You... Do you really think that you can marry Teacher Na Bo-Ri?

61
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:02,454
How ever it is, I will not allow you two to get married.

62
00:07:03,744 --> 00:07:06,616
- Why?
- Why don't you like Eun-Seong?

63
00:07:06,617 --> 00:07:10,474
You used to like her so much. Why all of a sudden don't you like her anymore?

64
00:07:11,422 --> 00:07:15,641
Even if you don't like Eun-Seong, how come you like Na Bo-Ri?

65
00:07:15,642 --> 00:07:19,744
She didn't even finish her studies and her parents left them and went to a temple.

66
00:07:19,745 --> 00:07:21,561
You want to marry someone like that?

67
00:07:22,017 --> 00:07:23,905
You want to have a monk as a father-in-law?

68
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:28,124
You're not a foolish person.

69
00:07:28,619 --> 00:07:31,758
Why are you so into starting a relationship with this kind of woman?

70
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:40,783
I... seriously don't know why and don't understand.

71
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:44,124
Seriously can't understand.

72
00:08:46,336 --> 00:08:49,149
- Yes...?
- Ah... Teacher.

73
00:08:50,832 --> 00:08:52,431
No... not asleep yet.

74
00:08:53,369 --> 00:08:54,541
What are you doing?

75
00:08:55,185 --> 00:08:59,698
I cooked ramen for Tae-In. Then I went to prepare a bed for Tae-In because he wanted to stay over tonight.

76
00:09:02,273 --> 00:09:05,324
Tae-In... Is at your place?

77
00:09:05,725 --> 00:09:06,325
Yes.

78
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,566
- Sleeping at your place?
- Yes.

79
00:09:12,476 --> 00:09:13,266
Why?

80
00:09:15,627 --> 00:09:19,716
He barged in my house requesting for food then doesn't want to sleep alone in an empty room.

81
00:09:22,584 --> 00:09:25,515
Even so... he cannot sleep over at your house. He's a grown man.

82
00:09:27,593 --> 00:09:31,206
He's just a kid to us. Sleep is the best thing for him right now.

83
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:34,806
- Bo-Ri...
- Yes?

84
00:09:40,737 --> 00:09:43,175
- Bo-Ri...
- Yes...?

85
00:09:46,101 --> 00:09:48,064
- Bo-Ri...
- What?

86
00:09:49,998 --> 00:09:50,877
I'm sorry.

87
00:09:52,365 --> 00:09:57,734
Yes?... Hello?

88
00:09:59,533 --> 00:10:00,321
I love you.

89
00:10:03,547 --> 00:10:05,910
Teacher's becoming like Tae-In.

90
00:11:33,479 --> 00:11:35,933
So pretty...

91
00:11:57,942 --> 00:12:03,204
I'm leaving... Can't sleep because it's too comfortable.

92
00:12:03,505 --> 00:12:05,500
See you later at the school.

93
00:13:07,372 --> 00:13:10,126
Where did Tae-In go? ...leaving only his bag at the desk.

94
00:13:42,565 --> 00:13:45,437
We said that we would go to school together...

95
00:13:45,438 --> 00:13:47,488
How come you're here first?

96
00:13:47,794 --> 00:13:49,510
It shouldn't be this way.

97
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,258
Are you well already?

98
00:13:55,371 --> 00:13:57,715
You're well, that's why you can play basketball?

99
00:13:59,325 --> 00:14:02,521
Park Tae-In... I'm getting angry.

100
00:14:04,513 --> 00:14:07,737
In a school, there's never a student that likes a teacher.

101
00:14:08,205 --> 00:14:14,594
If there is, it's just for a short period. It'll be forgotten after a while. You misunderstood.

102
00:14:19,888 --> 00:14:21,978
Still not able to let go?

103
00:14:22,626 --> 00:14:23,736
Feeling disturbed?

104
00:14:25,494 --> 00:14:29,128
You think you can't forget Biscuit? That's why you're like that?

105
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:33,622
How much does a cell phone cost now?

106
00:14:37,957 --> 00:14:38,462
Teacher Na.

107
00:14:41,275 --> 00:14:46,374
You have to be in the office if you're working in the school. Where did you disappear to?

108
00:14:47,034 --> 00:14:50,535
I'm sorry. I didn't know there was a meeting.

109
00:14:50,536 --> 00:14:51,883
So I've been weeding outside.

110
00:14:51,884 --> 00:14:55,004
If you repeat this often, you'll be fired.

111
00:14:55,648 --> 00:14:59,458
- What?
- Finally, they'll be conducting the teacher evaluation.

112
00:14:59,927 --> 00:15:03,912
Teacher Na falls under most of the checklist for resignation candidate.

113
00:15:06,332 --> 00:15:09,890
By following this, most of teachers have to be resigned.

114
00:15:10,271 --> 00:15:13,933
Maybe... Seong-Il Financial Group is trying to take over our school

115
00:15:14,134 --> 00:15:16,864
- What?
- What do you mean by that?

116
00:15:17,285 --> 00:15:21,845
Think about it... Why do they try to replace teachers? Why do they change school regulation?

117
00:15:22,848 --> 00:15:29,900
Even from the beginning, I felt that she was weird and very suspicious.

118
00:16:03,601 --> 00:16:05,500
It's a ghost.

119
00:16:07,304 --> 00:16:08,361
You don't have any work to do.

120
00:16:08,504 --> 00:16:12,462
And the person you like is no longer here.

121
00:16:12,893 --> 00:16:14,679
But you are still trying to be here.

122
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,064
This is what you call the Ghost of the School?

123
00:16:26,548 --> 00:16:29,713
After reading the new rules, you are still the same?

124
00:16:30,592 --> 00:16:34,526
You know you'll be fired... so you don't care?

125
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:39,969
Go on your way... You like to talk to the ghost a lot?

126
00:16:47,501 --> 00:16:52,775
This is the latest... It has good sales now.

127
00:16:56,203 --> 00:16:58,641
- How much?
- 550,000 won

128
00:17:00,745 --> 00:17:02,504
Buy 2, for 1.1 million won?

129
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:13,815
Why so expensive?... 1.1 million won.

130
00:17:14,293 --> 00:17:16,921
If I asked for 1.1 Million won from Father, he'd beat me to death.

131
00:17:32,739 --> 00:17:37,228
{\a6} * ajeosshi = mister, sir

132
00:17:32,739 --> 00:17:37,228
Ajeosshi... My uncle bought me this for 15 million.

133
00:17:37,229 --> 00:17:41,608
How can it be less 2 million? No way...

134
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:48,892
- There are some scratches. Surely you've been in a couple of accidents.
- Once only.

135
00:17:50,337 --> 00:17:54,401
Ajeosshi, please give me a higher price... There's not much left after buying the cell phone with this money.

136
00:17:54,402 --> 00:17:56,921
Ok. I'll add 100,000 won more.

137
00:17:58,932 --> 00:18:00,790
Not selling!

138
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:06,826
- Then don't, and return the money...
- Ah... Ajeosshi... please add another 300,000 won

139
00:18:06,827 --> 00:18:12,706
- Cannot. 200...
- 250.

140
00:18:12,765 --> 00:18:16,404
- 230!
- 240! I can't lower it anymore.

141
00:18:16,598 --> 00:18:20,962
Don't say anything else. 240! Cannot...! Cannot...! 240! Must be 240!

142
00:18:25,426 --> 00:18:26,590
What am I supposed to do?

143
00:18:32,023 --> 00:18:32,568
Hello?

144
00:18:33,148 --> 00:18:34,678
You haven't finished work yet?

145
00:18:36,262 --> 00:18:39,249
Wait a while. I'll come pick you up.

146
00:18:39,659 --> 00:18:42,883
No. I want to go back now.

147
00:18:43,538 --> 00:18:45,754
Need to buy a cell phone immediately.

148
00:18:46,689 --> 00:18:54,018
Don't want to always look at people's reaction. And I can't text message you. So disturbed...

149
00:18:55,081 --> 00:18:57,081
Your sister won't lend her cell phone to you?

150
00:18:57,894 --> 00:19:02,809
She complained about the expensive phone bill because I always talked to you. So she took it back.

151
00:19:03,483 --> 00:19:06,267
Don't stay there too long.

152
00:19:06,999 --> 00:19:09,226
The Ghost will appear if you stay alone too long in the school.

153
00:19:09,925 --> 00:19:12,449
I'm also a ghost... so it's ok.

154
00:19:13,094 --> 00:19:16,293
- What?
- Nothing... Go home then.

155
00:19:16,453 --> 00:19:18,688
Be careful on the road.

156
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,716
Ok...

157
00:20:40,226 --> 00:20:41,092
Hello?

158
00:20:42,499 --> 00:20:44,802
It's for Teacher...

159
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:47,891
Tae-In?

160
00:20:49,565 --> 00:20:51,366
It's your wedding gift.

161
00:20:54,221 --> 00:20:57,224
Where are you now? In the school?

162
00:20:57,914 --> 00:21:00,389
If not in school, then why?

163
00:21:00,868 --> 00:21:02,383
Where are you?

164
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:04,308
Back home.

165
00:21:08,136 --> 00:21:11,559
I didn't get the money from Father or steal it.

166
00:21:11,798 --> 00:21:13,432
So don't feel burdened.

167
00:21:13,793 --> 00:21:14,907
Understand?

168
00:21:17,087 --> 00:21:19,751
- Yes...
- Thank you.

169
00:21:20,702 --> 00:21:23,442
- Hang up then...
- Ok.

170
00:23:06,436 --> 00:23:08,516
Wishing you peace and goodnight...

171
00:23:09,556 --> 00:23:12,409
I can't say I love you...

172
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:22,984
I can't say that now but to only wish you... Goodnight...

173
00:23:54,126 --> 00:23:54,888
What?

174
00:23:54,889 --> 00:23:56,144
What is this?

175
00:23:56,145 --> 00:23:58,199
It can't be...

176
00:24:09,672 --> 00:24:12,564
How come the school's changed into a college?

177
00:24:12,565 --> 00:24:14,923
A sudden change. Besides,

178
00:24:15,265 --> 00:24:18,347
she is a person who studied overseas. How can she be like that?

179
00:24:18,766 --> 00:24:20,821
Ah... Really an immature person.

180
00:24:29,088 --> 00:24:30,610
Where did the Director go?

181
00:24:31,485 --> 00:24:34,963
She will only be satisfied if she sees the school being destroyed?

182
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:55,122
Say something. Why aren't you talking?

183
00:25:00,018 --> 00:25:02,554
You wanted to see my face, was that why you called me out?

184
00:25:03,424 --> 00:25:04,256
Yes.

185
00:25:05,051 --> 00:25:05,916
What?

186
00:25:06,268 --> 00:25:09,256
I wanted to see which part of you is prettier that mine.

187
00:25:09,904 --> 00:25:12,399
Nothing of yours is comparable to mine.

188
00:25:12,948 --> 00:25:15,914
Maybe Hyun-Woo likes the looks better...

189
00:25:17,577 --> 00:25:19,062
I wanted to see that.

190
00:25:22,775 --> 00:25:23,628
Hyun-Woo...

191
00:25:24,999 --> 00:25:28,917
We lived in France together before. Did you know?

192
00:25:34,692 --> 00:25:35,483
That...

193
00:25:37,642 --> 00:25:42,161
You are taller than me... prettier than me... much more glamorous than me...

194
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:46,746
Like you said, I have nothing better than you.

195
00:25:47,655 --> 00:25:49,067
But after being dumped by a man,

196
00:25:49,068 --> 00:25:52,339
You came looking for his lover like this... Doesn't this hurt your pride?

197
00:25:54,934 --> 00:25:58,130
You broke-up with him so long ago.

198
00:25:58,511 --> 00:26:02,896
Why are you still acting like that? You make me feel awkward.

199
00:26:14,387 --> 00:26:16,328
Don't talk to me like you know everything.

200
00:26:17,812 --> 00:26:19,672
Aren't you younger than me?

201
00:26:20,701 --> 00:26:24,014
Don't you know how to be respectful?

202
00:26:26,256 --> 00:26:28,320
I met him when I was 20 years old.

203
00:26:28,881 --> 00:26:30,936
And I didn't see anyone else for 10 years.

204
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:37,325
If I were to marry him, one of us has to take over the school.

205
00:26:38,467 --> 00:26:42,805
That was why I started studying and let him continue painting.

206
00:26:43,984 --> 00:26:45,240
You understand?

207
00:26:46,734 --> 00:26:51,529
Because of him, I had let go of my dreams.

208
00:26:51,979 --> 00:26:53,817
But I was suddenly dumped.

209
00:26:53,892 --> 00:26:57,317
Then I became a total mess.

210
00:26:58,098 --> 00:26:59,298
So seeing you like this

211
00:27:00,735 --> 00:27:02,081
doesn't hurt my pride a bit.

212
00:27:04,491 --> 00:27:06,243
I can get down on my knees and beg you.

213
00:27:09,182 --> 00:27:10,464
I can make myself cry

214
00:27:12,136 --> 00:27:13,704
till you give Hyun-Woo back to me.

215
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:18,104
To ask you to give him up

216
00:27:21,762 --> 00:27:23,756
and return him to me.

217
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:29,636
That's why I came here to ask you.

218
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,679
You're still young.

219
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,679
You can still love someone else...

220
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:49,716
But I cannot.

221
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:59,130
Without him... I don't know how to live.

222
00:28:03,022 --> 00:28:05,903
Can you help me?

223
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:48,531
<i>Are you thinking of me?</i>

224
00:29:07,971 --> 00:29:09,531
Why are you not saying anything?

225
00:29:12,004 --> 00:29:12,537
Bo-Ri...

226
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:18,127
I want to know one thing...

227
00:29:20,299 --> 00:29:24,252
- Chae Eun-Seong... Why did you break up with her?
- What?

228
00:29:27,376 --> 00:29:30,947
She sacrificed her life because of you.

229
00:29:32,762 --> 00:29:35,806
You broke up with her because you didn't like her anymore?

230
00:29:36,072 --> 00:29:39,886
What do you mean? Why do you suddenly bring up Eun-Seong?

231
00:29:42,921 --> 00:29:45,900
- Bo-Ri...
- It's nothing...

232
00:29:48,221 --> 00:29:57,635
Sheep 172, Sheep 173, Sheep 174...

233
00:29:59,456 --> 00:30:01,054
Sheep 175

234
00:30:05,374 --> 00:30:07,203
Why can't I sleep?

235
00:30:56,012 --> 00:31:00,556
<i>Because of him... I had let go of my dreams.</i>

236
00:31:00,886 --> 00:31:05,471
<i>But I was dumped suddenly. Then I became a total mess</i>

237
00:31:06,046 --> 00:31:12,402
<i>I can get down on my knees and beg you. I can make myself cry till you give Hyun-Woo back to me.</i>

238
00:31:26,761 --> 00:31:30,985
<i>Without him... I don't know how to live...</i>

239
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:35,797
<i>Can you help me?</i>

240
00:31:44,641 --> 00:31:46,022
Goodnight...

241
00:32:22,397 --> 00:32:24,905
What's the occasion?

242
00:32:24,906 --> 00:32:27,042
You came to see me first.

243
00:32:28,444 --> 00:32:32,708
- Seeing your expression, I already know.
- What?

244
00:32:32,709 --> 00:32:37,167
In these days, you cannot sleep nor eat... As if you were going to die.  Right?

245
00:32:38,044 --> 00:32:38,944
How do you know?

246
00:32:38,945 --> 00:32:43,155
Only now you know. How my heart aches because I like you.

247
00:32:43,917 --> 00:32:48,059
What you are going through now, it's nothing. For me, I had wanted to commit suicide.

248
00:32:48,951 --> 00:32:51,627
- What?
- I was just thinking about it...

249
00:32:51,945 --> 00:32:54,971
I'm not crazy. If I die, I will never see you again.

250
00:32:59,022 --> 00:33:00,396
Do you like me that much?

251
00:33:00,882 --> 00:33:03,271
Hold the kettle properly.

252
00:33:03,585 --> 00:33:06,486
The water is spilling.

253
00:33:10,207 --> 00:33:13,482
- Hey...
- The things that you want to do with me...

254
00:33:14,102 --> 00:33:16,310
Things that you always want to do together...

255
00:33:16,984 --> 00:33:18,920
From now onwards, let's do it together.

256
00:33:20,301 --> 00:33:23,101
Together, we shall go to the lake... Watch movies together.

257
00:33:24,294 --> 00:33:26,388
When your mother comes back to Korea, we'll have meals together.

258
00:33:27,392 --> 00:33:31,478
A person must go through a lost of love, then he'll become human.

259
00:33:33,138 --> 00:33:35,817
Good... Good... You have now became a human, Park Tae-In.

260
00:33:37,522 --> 00:33:39,421
Have you forgotten all about Biscuit yet?

261
00:33:40,568 --> 00:33:41,369
Not yet.

262
00:33:42,244 --> 00:33:43,079
It's not easy.

263
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:45,880
Even if it's not easy, you still have to clean it up properly.

264
00:33:48,734 --> 00:33:49,240
Wait...

265
00:33:50,883 --> 00:33:53,699
If you still miss another woman, how can you hold my hand?

266
00:33:53,764 --> 00:33:54,516
What?

267
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:56,652
Don't fool around.

268
00:34:01,619 --> 00:34:02,252
What did you say?

269
00:34:04,045 --> 00:34:07,196
The school... might be taken over by Seong-Il Financial Group.

270
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,939
I told you before...

271
00:34:10,418 --> 00:34:12,756
If I can't have you, at least I'll have this school.

272
00:34:13,579 --> 00:34:14,412
Eun-Seong.

273
00:34:14,795 --> 00:34:15,515
Why?

274
00:34:15,702 --> 00:34:16,811
Why...

275
00:34:17,714 --> 00:34:18,941
can't you forget about me?

276
00:34:20,595 --> 00:34:22,758
We were separated for so long.

277
00:34:23,272 --> 00:34:24,539
Why are you acting like this?

278
00:34:24,846 --> 00:34:26,237
You aren't that kind of person.

279
00:34:26,763 --> 00:34:28,102
You're strong and smart.

280
00:34:28,662 --> 00:34:29,807
You don't rely on anyone else.

281
00:34:30,294 --> 00:34:32,071
You do well without anyone's help.

282
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:36,046
That was me when we were together.

283
00:34:37,419 --> 00:34:40,819
But why do you like Na Bo-Ri?

284
00:34:41,378 --> 00:34:45,840
You dumped me... who was with you for 10 years.

285
00:34:47,662 --> 00:34:49,179
And liked someone whom you only knew for a few days?

286
00:34:51,075 --> 00:34:53,388
You are that person. That person who dumped me for Na Bo-RI.

287
00:34:55,533 --> 00:34:56,887
Miss Na Bo-Ri,

288
00:34:58,323 --> 00:34:59,601
she didn't tell you that she met up with me?

289
00:35:01,393 --> 00:35:02,750
I wanted her to let go...

290
00:35:03,944 --> 00:35:05,648
and give you back to me.

291
00:35:07,698 --> 00:35:10,737
Marry or separate...

292
00:35:11,485 --> 00:35:12,637
I want her to leave you.

293
00:35:13,215 --> 00:35:13,781
What?

294
00:35:14,181 --> 00:35:15,372
I want her to do that.

295
00:35:15,811 --> 00:35:16,711
Chae Eun-Seong...

296
00:35:16,979 --> 00:35:18,026
She seems to understand...

297
00:35:18,546 --> 00:35:19,974
If she doesn't let you go...

298
00:35:22,364 --> 00:35:23,578
I will still let go.

299
00:35:25,403 --> 00:35:28,668
Because I wouldn't want a person who liked a woman like her before.

300
00:35:44,775 --> 00:35:45,530
Hello.

301
00:35:46,097 --> 00:35:46,675
Where are you?

302
00:35:49,374 --> 00:35:49,670
What?

303
00:35:50,637 --> 00:35:51,472
Where!

304
00:35:53,915 --> 00:35:55,741
I'm watering the plants.

305
00:36:09,138 --> 00:36:10,795
Why didn't you tell me that you met up with Eun-Seong?

306
00:36:13,097 --> 00:36:14,010
Why didn't you?

307
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,638
Do I have to report to you on whoever I meet?

308
00:36:18,177 --> 00:36:19,932
Not everyone but because it was Eun-Seong.

309
00:36:21,515 --> 00:36:22,927
Yesterday was because of this?

310
00:36:24,842 --> 00:36:27,094
You suddenly asked about why I left Eun-Seong...

311
00:36:27,849 --> 00:36:29,554
Because you just met Eun-Seong?

312
00:36:30,166 --> 00:36:31,161
Your heart was moved?

313
00:36:32,706 --> 00:36:34,067
Eun-Seong is very good at that.

314
00:36:34,888 --> 00:36:38,596
That is the strategy that she used to separate us.

315
00:36:39,563 --> 00:36:40,519
Don't misunderstand.

316
00:36:41,055 --> 00:36:44,221
There is no one that will destroy themselves to hurt others.

317
00:36:44,513 --> 00:36:45,365
Forget about Eun-Seong.

318
00:36:46,899 --> 00:36:47,995
Don't see her anymore...

319
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:50,415
Even if you see her in school, pretend you don't know her.

320
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,921
I broke up with her and what are you still thinking about it?

321
00:36:54,262 --> 00:36:55,675
If it goes on, it will affect our relationship.

322
00:36:58,539 --> 00:37:00,447
I'm a woman with lots of imperfections.

323
00:37:03,426 --> 00:37:06,762
I don't have any confidence to continue to be with you.

324
00:37:08,572 --> 00:37:12,144
Waking up every morning... being scolded by you every time...

325
00:37:13,409 --> 00:37:15,699
Having to live with that everyday...

326
00:37:17,379 --> 00:37:18,946
Do you know how worried I am?

327
00:37:21,527 --> 00:37:23,353
I don't know when you will stop loving me...

328
00:37:25,008 --> 00:37:27,034
and break up with me.

329
00:37:28,819 --> 00:37:32,856
It's like I'm seeing you in a danger zone.

330
00:37:35,886 --> 00:37:36,915
I'm sorry...

331
00:37:41,097 --> 00:37:42,072
Why don't you trust me...

332
00:37:43,291 --> 00:37:44,238
Why don't you trust me?

333
00:37:46,912 --> 00:37:48,377
Why feel lost and unsure?

334
00:38:42,655 --> 00:38:43,848
I wasn't going to come here again.

335
00:38:47,821 --> 00:38:51,178
You never listen my prayer.

336
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,387
Last one...

337
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:59,203
I will not come anymore.

338
00:39:03,859 --> 00:39:05,353
The person I love...

339
00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:12,158
Don't allow her to love someone else

340
00:39:21,093 --> 00:39:23,040
You have to agree.

341
00:39:25,601 --> 00:39:27,196
Other than this, I have nothing else to ask.

342
00:39:44,791 --> 00:39:45,744
I beg you...

343
00:39:48,131 --> 00:39:48,590
Beg you...

344
00:40:19,848 --> 00:40:20,558
Hello?

345
00:40:21,973 --> 00:40:22,422
Yes...

346
00:40:23,548 --> 00:40:24,719
I am Director Lee.

347
00:40:26,979 --> 00:40:27,626
Summons?

348
00:40:28,974 --> 00:40:29,808
What summons?

349
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:33,891
No...

350
00:40:35,124 --> 00:40:39,054
I have been managing the school very well for 25 years.

351
00:40:39,055 --> 00:40:40,825
Why have I received a summons out of the blue?

352
00:40:41,885 --> 00:40:45,563
Chae Eun-Seong is the Head but I'm the person in charge.

353
00:40:45,968 --> 00:40:49,193
And... we merged with the Seong-Il Financial Group.

354
00:40:51,838 --> 00:40:53,225
What do you mean?

355
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,726
You want us to hand the school over to the Seong-Il Finance Group?

356
00:40:56,878 --> 00:40:57,900
What's the matter?

357
00:40:59,729 --> 00:41:00,477
No...

358
00:41:01,349 --> 00:41:03,858
You want me to go to a summons because of this?

359
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:07,915
Why do I have to accept this and hand over the school to the Seong-Il Finance Group?

360
00:41:10,101 --> 00:41:10,865
I understand...

361
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:12,189
I will come now...

362
00:41:13,332 --> 00:41:15,420
I know... I'll hang up first.

363
00:41:18,038 --> 00:41:18,755
What's going on?

364
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:20,381
I don't know.

365
00:41:21,059 --> 00:41:22,485
What's going on?

366
00:41:23,253 --> 00:41:23,970
No...

367
00:41:24,235 --> 00:41:28,256
I really don't understand why...

368
00:41:29,305 --> 00:41:31,222
oh... oh... Dear...

369
00:41:31,767 --> 00:41:34,401
Eun-Seong... I don't think that something has happened.

370
00:41:35,107 --> 00:41:37,788
No... Don't tell me there's something going on...

371
00:41:50,462 --> 00:41:51,193
I have something to show you.

372
00:41:59,113 --> 00:42:00,030
What are you doing here?

373
00:42:02,292 --> 00:42:02,705
Teacher...

374
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:05,120
Don't think of unnecessary things... go to school.

375
00:42:09,242 --> 00:42:09,827
What are you doing?

376
00:42:11,179 --> 00:42:11,499
Bo-Ri...

377
00:42:19,853 --> 00:42:20,403
Take a look.

378
00:42:31,458 --> 00:42:32,858
When did you take all these pictures?

379
00:42:34,151 --> 00:42:35,259
I didn't want you to know.

380
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:37,268
I didn't want others to know too...

381
00:42:38,586 --> 00:42:40,058
That's why I took it secretly.

382
00:42:45,087 --> 00:42:46,410
This is when I was washing the toilet.

383
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:49,776
If a cigarette was given to you...

384
00:42:51,096 --> 00:42:52,135
you'd surely smoke it immediately.

385
00:42:56,472 --> 00:42:57,391
This is when,

386
00:42:57,812 --> 00:42:59,682
I was punished in-front of the Teacher's room.

387
00:43:01,386 --> 00:43:03,116
Why did you take only this kind of pictures?

388
00:43:04,463 --> 00:43:09,217
It's because this section only has pictures of you being punished. There're many others in these albums.

389
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:13,416
This is when you were drawing.

390
00:43:14,456 --> 00:43:17,702
And... All these are you.

391
00:43:19,919 --> 00:43:21,041
Everything is you...

392
00:43:21,524 --> 00:43:24,945
The storage is full of big drawings of you. Wanna go see them?

393
00:43:28,362 --> 00:43:29,379
Don't worry too much.

394
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:32,880
Since I met you,

395
00:43:33,977 --> 00:43:35,167
I only draw you alone.

396
00:43:36,047 --> 00:43:38,354
That is why you have to trust me.

397
00:43:39,991 --> 00:43:42,765
Don't be confused after you hear what people say.

398
00:43:54,972 --> 00:43:55,979
Are you a fool?

399
00:43:57,667 --> 00:44:00,262
Why did you bring this when you even don't have a motorcycle?

400
00:44:00,495 --> 00:44:01,626
I'm an idiot.

401
00:44:09,407 --> 00:44:12,450
What's happening?

402
00:44:12,746 --> 00:44:14,222
Why are we supposed to hand over the school to your Finance Group?

403
00:44:14,316 --> 00:44:15,141
Sit down...

404
00:44:15,406 --> 00:44:16,248
Eun-Seong!

405
00:44:16,513 --> 00:44:17,915
Please sit down first.

406
00:44:18,465 --> 00:44:19,587
I will explain to you.

407
00:44:45,851 --> 00:44:48,818
This school... is managed by me right now.

408
00:44:50,608 --> 00:44:51,184
So?

409
00:44:52,446 --> 00:44:53,636
The term was...

410
00:44:54,462 --> 00:44:56,161
I will manage it if I were to marry Hyun-Woo.

411
00:44:57,018 --> 00:44:57,563
Then?

412
00:44:58,228 --> 00:44:58,857
Then...

413
00:44:59,761 --> 00:45:01,017
Hyun-Woo dislikes me

414
00:45:01,582 --> 00:45:03,090
- and I'm not able to marry Hyun-Woo,
- So...

415
00:45:03,569 --> 00:45:05,116
Since you can't marry Hyun-Woo...

416
00:45:05,701 --> 00:45:07,111
You want to take the school?

417
00:45:08,294 --> 00:45:08,794
No...

418
00:45:10,658 --> 00:45:12,290
That might happen...

419
00:45:12,291 --> 00:45:15,193
so you have to help me get married to Hyun-Woo.

420
00:45:15,194 --> 00:45:17,061
It is not I, who is getting married.

421
00:45:17,531 --> 00:45:19,905
I've been helping so much.

422
00:45:20,452 --> 00:45:22,772
You can't expect me to pull him into the church.

423
00:45:23,506 --> 00:45:24,455
Just pull him.

424
00:45:25,506 --> 00:45:25,930
What?

425
00:45:26,541 --> 00:45:28,486
I told him before...

426
00:45:29,508 --> 00:45:31,992
If he is not going to marry me, I will take the school.

427
00:45:34,068 --> 00:45:34,630
Hyun-Woo...

428
00:45:35,701 --> 00:45:36,905
didn't care what I said.

429
00:45:40,868 --> 00:45:42,926
I studied painting with Hyun-Woo.

430
00:45:44,371 --> 00:45:46,718
One of us has to take over the school...

431
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:49,554
and so he continued painting...

432
00:45:49,766 --> 00:45:50,463
I stopped.

433
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,281
Without Hyun-Woo,

434
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:56,187
I have nowhere to go.

435
00:46:00,313 --> 00:46:01,299
In the end...

436
00:46:02,034 --> 00:46:04,753
I don't care about this school...

437
00:46:04,754 --> 00:46:09,070
Whether I bring it under our Financial Group... or close the school.

438
00:46:09,841 --> 00:46:11,189
Is erasing the board,

439
00:46:11,796 --> 00:46:12,804
one of the things that you want to do together with me?

440
00:46:13,578 --> 00:46:15,812
Not just erasing the board... Not just this.

441
00:46:16,938 --> 00:46:21,458
The other students helped me erase the board...

442
00:46:21,821 --> 00:46:23,317
Water the plants...

443
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:26,325
They helped me with my work, but you don't.

444
00:46:27,042 --> 00:46:31,487
The other day, I was burning the trash and I was so dirty...

445
00:46:31,658 --> 00:46:32,744
You didn't care at all.

446
00:46:34,548 --> 00:46:38,833
If I were to do it together with you this week, you'll still feel bad.

447
00:46:41,862 --> 00:46:42,719
Biscuit...

448
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:44,402
Have you forgotten about it?

449
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:48,615
Ermm...

450
00:46:50,422 --> 00:46:50,781
Yeah.

451
00:46:51,487 --> 00:46:54,448
How do you feel when you have to forget about the person you love?

452
00:46:55,445 --> 00:46:55,944
Not good.

453
00:46:56,721 --> 00:46:59,073
That's right. Why do you love someone you can't have?

454
00:46:59,409 --> 00:47:01,690
The person that you can get is beside you.

455
00:47:04,985 --> 00:47:07,409
But... I feel very tired.

456
00:47:09,306 --> 00:47:11,802
I'll wait for you even if I'm tired. Don't worry.

457
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,585
But then, why did you fall in love with a teacher?

458
00:47:18,374 --> 00:47:20,210
As if you are Romeo and Juliet.

459
00:47:21,205 --> 00:47:23,190
Wanted to fall in love with someone you shouldn't?

460
00:47:24,621 --> 00:47:27,706
I hate you a lot.

461
00:47:29,109 --> 00:47:29,723
Hey!

462
00:47:31,444 --> 00:47:34,890
Hey! You did something that deserves a beating...

463
00:47:35,296 --> 00:47:35,898
Don't!

464
00:47:37,675 --> 00:47:39,427
- Hey!
- Don't!

465
00:47:51,281 --> 00:47:53,662
What are you doing in the class?

466
00:47:54,473 --> 00:47:55,438
If you want to kiss, go outside.

467
00:47:59,234 --> 00:48:02,467
Continue on like this, you'll be married right after you graduate high school.

468
00:48:04,508 --> 00:48:07,653
They already have. You already have a new plan? Keep it up.

469
00:48:08,493 --> 00:48:10,294
Hey... hey...

470
00:48:13,054 --> 00:48:13,943
Brats!

471
00:48:27,396 --> 00:48:29,149
You want me to finish up this painting?

472
00:48:30,373 --> 00:48:30,834
Yes.

473
00:48:32,792 --> 00:48:33,691
What is this?

474
00:48:33,955 --> 00:48:35,203
What should I paint?

475
00:48:36,965 --> 00:48:37,388
Anything.

476
00:48:39,010 --> 00:48:40,485
Anything? On this?

477
00:48:43,261 --> 00:48:46,592
But this is your piece of painting...

478
00:48:47,635 --> 00:48:49,145
I'm afraid of ruining it.

479
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:50,001
That's fine.

480
00:48:51,325 --> 00:48:54,058
It's dirty. What should we do?

481
00:48:54,466 --> 00:48:55,139
It's ok.

482
00:48:55,818 --> 00:48:57,137
Just paint whatever you want.

483
00:49:14,601 --> 00:49:15,850
It's really dirty now...

484
00:49:18,354 --> 00:49:20,123
Oh gosh... Teacher.

485
00:49:20,124 --> 00:49:21,852
No... It's ok.

486
00:49:24,036 --> 00:49:24,924
Oh gosh...

487
00:49:28,686 --> 00:49:30,212
Oh... what to do, Teacher?

488
00:49:34,643 --> 00:49:37,174
Oh... what to do, Teacher?

489
00:49:45,474 --> 00:49:46,401
Did you do that on purpose?

490
00:49:47,718 --> 00:49:48,346
Are you ok?

491
00:49:49,177 --> 00:49:50,675
It's ok.

492
00:49:55,283 --> 00:49:58,050
You really... Come here...

493
00:49:58,109 --> 00:50:00,814
- Wait a minute...
- Come here...

494
00:50:00,815 --> 00:50:04,367
- You drew on me a lot...
- You drew on me even more...

495
00:50:04,463 --> 00:50:09,123
No... Don't draw on me... Wait...

496
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:19,910
Noona...

497
00:50:20,990 --> 00:50:22,086
How's the school?

498
00:50:24,308 --> 00:50:26,156
- Hello.
- You...

499
00:50:26,564 --> 00:50:29,877
You... You better go talk to Eun-Seong.

500
00:50:30,357 --> 00:50:32,470
What's the matter? Why?

501
00:50:33,006 --> 00:50:34,304
You want to give up the school?

502
00:50:35,537 --> 00:50:36,105
You...

503
00:50:36,993 --> 00:50:38,649
Go and apologise to Eun-Seong now.

504
00:50:38,865 --> 00:50:41,506
Understand? I will choose a wedding date for you.

505
00:50:41,507 --> 00:50:43,451
On that day, you two should just get married.

506
00:50:43,452 --> 00:50:47,964
You don't need to care about other things.

507
00:50:48,368 --> 00:50:51,818
And you, Teacher Na... Resign and leave Hyun-Woo immediately.

508
00:50:52,146 --> 00:50:52,698
Noona!

509
00:50:53,086 --> 00:50:56,303
A person should know what shame is.

510
00:50:56,735 --> 00:50:58,920
Even if you're not intelligent, you should know what to do at this point.

511
00:50:59,544 --> 00:51:01,080
- Noona!
- Shut up!

512
00:51:02,115 --> 00:51:07,181
Why are you being so hard headed? You think I'm kidding?

513
00:51:07,883 --> 00:51:10,932
Is Grandfather's and Father's school going to be sold to someone else?

514
00:51:11,604 --> 00:51:12,876
How can this be?

515
00:51:14,821 --> 00:51:15,781
And...

516
00:51:16,724 --> 00:51:20,013
Why must Teacher Na Bo-Ri marry Hyun-Woo?

517
00:51:22,413 --> 00:51:24,502
Noona, go outside. I'll talk to you outside.

518
00:51:25,324 --> 00:51:27,479
Liking and marrying...

519
00:51:27,773 --> 00:51:29,525
They are two different issues.

520
00:51:30,149 --> 00:51:31,998
Do you think you're suitable together?

521
00:51:32,598 --> 00:51:36,247
Teacher, you think you're able to get Hyun-Woo?

522
00:51:36,727 --> 00:51:39,353
Enough! What else do you want to say?

523
00:51:42,717 --> 00:51:45,306
Don't blame me... I too...

524
00:51:45,821 --> 00:51:48,067
I've been very patient.

525
00:51:51,529 --> 00:51:54,165
You... Must not forget...

526
00:51:54,833 --> 00:51:56,790
The name that established this school is Ji Jeong-Su.

527
00:51:57,095 --> 00:52:02,768
As long as I am Ji Hyun-Ae and you are Ji Hyun-Woo. You cannot run away from the school.

528
00:52:03,032 --> 00:52:06,585
Until you are dead, you have to marry Eun-Seong.

529
00:52:09,011 --> 00:52:11,035
It's better for us not to meet again, Teacher.

530
00:52:31,981 --> 00:52:37,124
I want to clean up. I should get going.

531
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:31,119
Some say that if you change suddenly, it'll lead to death.

532
00:53:31,236 --> 00:53:33,640
You have to finish doing all the things that you want to do with me.

533
00:53:34,469 --> 00:53:36,905
You... You are looking for sympathy.

534
00:53:37,486 --> 00:53:42,645
That is why you are doing this. You want to use me to forget about Biscuit.

535
00:53:44,607 --> 00:53:47,548
If it is reason no. 1, you are going to die today.

536
00:53:48,236 --> 00:53:51,390
If it's reason no.2... I can let you go.

537
00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:53,022
Which one?

538
00:53:54,812 --> 00:53:55,449
Second one.

539
00:53:55,809 --> 00:53:56,409
Really?

540
00:53:57,081 --> 00:53:57,778
Really.

541
00:54:02,261 --> 00:54:05,265
You have to eat and sleep at the right time.

542
00:54:06,045 --> 00:54:07,941
You are very weak at this point in time.

543
00:54:09,288 --> 00:54:10,582
The loser has to buy pizza.

544
00:54:11,195 --> 00:54:12,983
No... chicken ginseng soup.

545
00:54:13,402 --> 00:54:16,632
- What?
- You are really weak right now.

546
00:54:26,622 --> 00:54:27,229
3...

547
00:54:29,657 --> 00:54:30,133
2...

548
00:54:32,225 --> 00:54:32,515
1...

549
00:54:34,145 --> 00:54:34,652
0...

550
00:55:09,171 --> 00:55:10,611
<i>The person I love...</i>

551
00:55:14,213 --> 00:55:16,661
<i>Don't let her love someone else.</i>

552
00:55:26,795 --> 00:55:27,569
Tae-In.

553
00:56:12,492 --> 00:56:12,972
Tae-In...

554
00:56:16,983 --> 00:56:17,509
Hey...

555
00:56:19,232 --> 00:56:19,958
Tae-In

556
00:56:21,230 --> 00:56:22,502
Are you awake?

557
00:56:28,655 --> 00:56:30,770
Hey... Are you awake?

558
00:56:34,699 --> 00:56:35,379
Are you awake?

559
00:56:38,277 --> 00:56:38,812
Are you ok?

560
00:56:41,755 --> 00:56:42,851
I'll buy chicken ginseng soup.

561
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:48,469
You scared me.

562
00:56:52,013 --> 00:56:53,995
I told you I will take over the school.

563
00:56:54,723 --> 00:56:55,988
That's nonsense.

564
00:56:56,618 --> 00:56:58,220
How are you going to manage it?

565
00:56:59,017 --> 00:57:00,579
I was going to manage it anyway.

566
00:57:01,083 --> 00:57:02,332
Our grandfather started it...

567
00:57:02,412 --> 00:57:05,093
Our Father took over it and now it is my turn.

568
00:57:05,525 --> 00:57:07,037
Why do you have to jump in, Noona?

569
00:57:07,353 --> 00:57:10,330
Bro-In-law, you have to speak nicely.

570
00:57:11,247 --> 00:57:13,840
Yes... I jumped in.

571
00:57:13,864 --> 00:57:17,040
Your father didn't believe in you at that point in time.

572
00:57:17,041 --> 00:57:24,386
Because you only liked to paint and drink. I didn't want you to suffer and that was why I took over the school.

573
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:27,982
Why do you have to marry her?

574
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:31,880
You think I married your Bro-In-law because I liked him?

575
00:57:31,947 --> 00:57:36,200
If there had been any one of our family who could have taken over the hospital,

576
00:57:36,395 --> 00:57:38,191
I wouldn't have married your brother-in-law.

577
00:57:38,748 --> 00:57:40,617
When I was 25 years old,

578
00:57:40,626 --> 00:57:43,547
I had to cause a married man with a child to get a divorce. Then I got married

579
00:57:43,627 --> 00:57:46,433
to your Bro-In-law. I let him manage the whole hospital.

580
00:57:46,434 --> 00:57:48,993
Only now am I able to come out of the school.

581
00:57:49,758 --> 00:57:52,549
I'm 44 years old now. I started managing the school at a young age.

582
00:57:52,675 --> 00:57:55,471
My life had changed because of that.

583
00:57:55,662 --> 00:57:57,097
Do you see it?

584
00:57:57,298 --> 00:57:58,925
Don't you feel it for your Noona's life?

585
00:58:08,399 --> 00:58:10,502
Don't continue to be like this.

586
00:58:10,947 --> 00:58:13,627
For the sake of your happiness, you have to make this decision.

587
00:58:13,628 --> 00:58:15,476
Why don't you know how to appreciate this...

588
00:58:15,477 --> 00:58:18,670
You are only being hard headed.

589
00:58:36,375 --> 00:58:36,967
Tae-In.

590
00:58:41,403 --> 00:58:42,634
Why so late?

591
00:58:43,273 --> 00:58:44,193
What's the matter?

592
00:58:46,039 --> 00:58:48,354
Came out for jogging...

593
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:51,440
Why jogging so late at night?

594
00:58:52,275 --> 00:58:53,350
You ran here?

595
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:55,220
Yes.

596
00:58:57,149 --> 00:58:58,493
You're so weird.

597
00:59:00,773 --> 00:59:02,160
Go in. I'm leaving.

598
00:59:10,009 --> 00:59:10,616
Tae-In.

599
00:59:14,855 --> 00:59:16,567
Do you want me to make ramen for you?

600
00:59:25,949 --> 00:59:27,431
I will cook a more delicious one the next time.

601
00:59:28,070 --> 00:59:29,844
Right now I don't have the strength to do it.

602
00:59:34,406 --> 00:59:35,372
Be careful. It's hot.

603
00:59:36,915 --> 00:59:38,224
Why are you jogging at this hour?

604
00:59:41,548 --> 00:59:42,579
Eat slowly.

605
00:59:50,644 --> 00:59:53,073
I always play during school. That is why I can't sleep.

606
00:59:53,165 --> 00:59:54,945
After sweating, maybe I can sleep.

607
00:59:55,771 --> 00:59:57,143
But do you have to come this far?

608
01:00:00,356 --> 01:00:02,763
Don't talk to me when I'm eating.

609
01:00:03,286 --> 01:00:04,680
Sorry... Eat.

610
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:07,911
Why do you not have strength?

611
01:00:09,217 --> 01:00:11,433
This morning you were laughing together with him.

612
01:00:16,349 --> 01:00:17,588
I'll get some rice for you.

613
01:00:38,178 --> 01:00:39,413
Could you sleep here tonight?

614
01:00:42,467 --> 01:00:42,891
Why?

615
01:00:44,554 --> 01:00:49,935
I've been only living with my younger sister for more than 10 years.

616
01:00:50,735 --> 01:00:56,383
When you slept here the other day, it felt like we had one more family member. So, I was happy.

617
01:02:08,853 --> 01:02:09,165
Teacher.

618
01:02:11,609 --> 01:02:12,045
Teacher.

619
01:02:20,508 --> 01:02:22,390
Why are you crying? Did you have a bad dream?

620
01:02:40,213 --> 01:02:40,749
What's wrong?

621
01:03:16,932 --> 01:03:18,694
<i>This is my prayer.</i>

622
01:03:20,674 --> 01:03:22,403
<i>I wish this woman whom I love,</i>

623
01:03:23,812 --> 01:03:26,630
<i>does not fall in love with another person.</i>

624
01:03:29,699 --> 01:03:31,473
<i>If I'm with this woman,</i>

625
01:03:33,234 --> 01:03:36,051
<i>I have the courage to go through any ordeal.</i>

626
01:03:38,505 --> 01:03:40,762
<i>But if this woman loves someone else,</i>

627
01:03:42,919 --> 01:03:45,077
<i>I don't have a reason to live.</i>

628
01:03:47,630 --> 01:03:51,460
<i>So, God, if you exist, please listen my prayer.</i>

629
01:03:53,442 --> 01:03:55,467
<i>I wish this woman whom I love,</i>

630
01:03:56,611 --> 01:03:58,989
<i>does not fall in love with another person.</i>
