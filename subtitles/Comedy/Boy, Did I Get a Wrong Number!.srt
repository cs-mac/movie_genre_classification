1
00:01:55,497 --> 00:02:00,210
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!
Oh, yeah!

2
00:02:00,294 --> 00:02:03,589
Okay, you're great.

3
00:02:03,672 --> 00:02:06,717
- You got the line?
- Yeah. Come on up, slowpoke.

4
00:02:12,806 --> 00:02:16,393
Help!

5
00:02:17,769 --> 00:02:21,523
You okay? You know,
we're 50 miles from anybody.

6
00:02:21,607 --> 00:02:24,526
- Who are you screamin' for?
- You!

7
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:27,029
Come on.

8
00:02:28,113 --> 00:02:30,407
Just pull me up!

9
00:02:32,826 --> 00:02:34,787
Rich?

10
00:02:36,455 --> 00:02:38,749
Just pull me up.

11
00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:45,214
All right, don't be a dick,
Richie. I need a pull.

12
00:02:45,297 --> 00:02:47,424
Rich?

13
00:02:47,508 --> 00:02:50,219
Rich?

14
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:54,598
What...

15
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,101
When you plant seed
into your own kin, you anger God.

16
00:06:23,185 --> 00:06:28,440
Still have not been
able to locate the two college students.

17
00:06:28,523 --> 00:06:32,443
Richard Stoker and Halley Smith
have been missing since last Monday...

18
00:06:32,526 --> 00:06:34,613
after failing to return
from a weekend of rock...

19
00:07:45,768 --> 00:07:48,354
- Hey. How are you doin'?

20
00:07:48,437 --> 00:07:51,856
Do you have any idea
what's going on up here?

21
00:07:53,191 --> 00:07:55,611
Tractor jackknifed
about five mile up.

22
00:07:55,695 --> 00:07:57,904
Spilled chemicals and shit
all over the road.

23
00:07:57,946 --> 00:08:00,241
Any idea how long
it'll take to clean up?

24
00:08:00,324 --> 00:08:04,077
- Couple hours.
- Couple hours?

25
00:08:04,119 --> 00:08:07,248
You in a hurry?

26
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:10,752
Yeah. I need to get
to Raleigh tonight.

27
00:08:10,835 --> 00:08:13,670
- What you oughta do
is get back in your car,
- Mm-hmm.

28
00:08:13,754 --> 00:08:16,049
Fix your hair a couple
hundred more times...

29
00:08:16,132 --> 00:08:18,925
Thank you.

30
00:08:41,448 --> 00:08:45,120
Hey, Doris.
This is Chris Flynn.

31
00:08:45,203 --> 00:08:47,956
I have a 7:00 p.m.
Interview with Mr. Keller.

32
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:50,500
I'm, uh, running
about 30 minutes late.

33
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:52,793
- I was wondering if you could...

34
00:08:52,877 --> 00:08:55,839
Hello? Hello?

35
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,633
I'm not gonna make this.

36
00:09:46,556 --> 00:09:49,726
Excuse me, sir.
Do you have a pay phone?

37
00:10:01,821 --> 00:10:05,701
Uh, this one's not working. Do you
have another phone I could use?

38
00:10:05,743 --> 00:10:08,746
Long distance?

39
00:10:08,787 --> 00:10:11,373
What isn't long distance
from here, right?

40
00:10:11,415 --> 00:10:13,374
You cuttin' wise
with me, son?

41
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:16,879
No, sir, I'm just...
I'm runnin' behind...

42
00:10:16,962 --> 00:10:19,882
and I really need
to make a call.

43
00:10:19,924 --> 00:10:22,718
Well, that'n there
is my only phone.

44
00:10:22,801 --> 00:10:24,845
Right.

45
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:30,893
Well, uh, the highway's
really jammed up.

46
00:10:30,935 --> 00:10:33,437
Do you know of another
route heading south?

47
00:10:33,521 --> 00:10:36,232
- No.
- No.

48
00:10:42,863 --> 00:10:45,448
Why is this Bear Mountain Road
dotted like this?

49
00:10:45,532 --> 00:10:48,244
- Dirt.
- Dirt road?

50
00:10:48,285 --> 00:10:51,539
'Fraid they ain't got around
to pavin' it yet.

51
00:10:51,622 --> 00:10:55,209
It looks like it runs into the highway
about 15, 20 miles. Is that right?

52
00:10:55,293 --> 00:10:57,420
If you say so.

53
00:10:59,505 --> 00:11:02,800
It could work.
Thank you very much.

54
00:11:02,884 --> 00:11:04,886
You take care, okay?

55
00:11:16,314 --> 00:11:20,109
You're the one
gonna need to take care.

56
00:12:48,073 --> 00:12:50,409
Wejust got nailed, man.!

57
00:12:50,492 --> 00:12:53,203
- Jesus Christ.!
- Shit.!

58
00:12:53,287 --> 00:12:55,539
- Goddamn drunken hillbilly!
- Hey. Hey, you all right?

59
00:12:55,581 --> 00:12:59,042
I'm so sorry.
I was just...

60
00:12:59,084 --> 00:13:01,086
- Jesus.
- I was just comin' around the bend.

61
00:13:01,128 --> 00:13:03,922
- I didn't even see... I got distracted.
- My God, you could've died!

62
00:13:04,006 --> 00:13:06,717
- Are you guys all okay?
- Yeah, yeah. You wanna sit down?

63
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,344
- You might be in shock.
- What were you doing
driving so goddamn fast?

64
00:13:09,428 --> 00:13:12,556
- All right, all right.
- Why was your truck parked
in the middle of the road?

65
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,725
Because we blew out
our tires, asshole!

66
00:13:14,767 --> 00:13:18,562
- I'll pay for whatever damage was done.
- That's my mom's car!

67
00:13:18,604 --> 00:13:20,606
All right, Frannie.
The man said he'd pay for...

68
00:13:20,647 --> 00:13:23,400
Oh, looks like you killed
my bike here too.

69
00:13:23,484 --> 00:13:27,029
I'm sorry. L...
How did you blow out your tires?

70
00:13:27,112 --> 00:13:29,573
Someone left some barbed wire
in the middle of the road.

71
00:13:29,657 --> 00:13:32,117
I can't believe someone
just dropped it there.

72
00:13:32,201 --> 00:13:35,454
Nobody dropped anything.

73
00:13:35,537 --> 00:13:37,748
I just found this tied to a tree.
Somebody did this.

74
00:13:37,831 --> 00:13:40,751
Southern hospitality at its finest.

75
00:13:40,793 --> 00:13:43,420
- Redneck assholes.
- I'm gonna try and find a phone.

76
00:13:43,462 --> 00:13:46,257
I think I saw a gas station
like a couple miles back.

77
00:13:46,298 --> 00:13:48,968
- I'm gonna come with you.
- There is no phone.

78
00:13:49,052 --> 00:13:52,471
- I was just there.
- Why don't we just wait for
someone else to come along?

79
00:13:52,513 --> 00:13:54,808
What, like Speed Racer here?

80
00:13:54,891 --> 00:13:59,145
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Okay, you guys go, and
we'll just stay here, Francine.

81
00:13:59,228 --> 00:14:02,315
- And get high.
- Yeah. So what?

82
00:14:02,398 --> 00:14:04,608
- Careful. They don't like stoners.
- Who are you calling a stoner?

83
00:14:04,692 --> 00:14:06,902
- Your mom.
- Hey, what's your name?

84
00:14:06,986 --> 00:14:08,779
Chris Flynn.

85
00:14:08,863 --> 00:14:11,241
You hurt, Chris Flynn?

86
00:14:11,325 --> 00:14:14,327
- No, I'm fine.
- Good.

87
00:14:16,496 --> 00:14:19,290
- 'Cause you're the mule.
- Oh, no.

88
00:14:19,373 --> 00:14:22,585
You know, I can carry that. You just
had the whole car accident thing.

89
00:14:22,668 --> 00:14:25,046
Yeah, we'll just stay here
and maybe get hit again.

90
00:14:25,129 --> 00:14:27,257
- Are you guys sure you're cool?
- Yeah.

91
00:14:27,341 --> 00:14:29,634
Yeah, we'll be just fine.
Thank you.

92
00:14:29,717 --> 00:14:33,638
- Mess you up.
- Yeah, smoke it up there, uh, Skippy.

93
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:36,808
- Yeah, have fun.
- I don't fuckin'believe this.

94
00:14:39,644 --> 00:14:41,938
Your mom's gonna kick your ass.

95
00:14:43,732 --> 00:14:46,359
God, I cannot get out of my head
what just happened.

96
00:14:46,442 --> 00:14:50,154
- Are you sure you're all right? Yeah?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

97
00:14:50,238 --> 00:14:52,574
What are you guys
doing out here?

98
00:14:52,657 --> 00:14:55,827
Uh, uh, oh, camping.
Uh, I don't know. Actually, we're lost.

99
00:14:55,869 --> 00:14:59,999
You know, a lot of people say...
who have been through similar
traumatic experiences...

100
00:15:00,082 --> 00:15:04,545
that the following moments kind of feel
like you're moving kind of in slow motion.

101
00:15:04,628 --> 00:15:06,880
- Do you feel like that?
- No.

102
00:15:06,963 --> 00:15:10,634
I should tell you that my voice
is fairly low and normal speed.

103
00:15:15,473 --> 00:15:19,476
- Pretty good.
- Mm-hmm.

104
00:15:23,146 --> 00:15:25,231
Where'd you get this?

105
00:15:25,315 --> 00:15:28,193
Um, I got it out of my
dad's room, actually.

106
00:15:28,276 --> 00:15:31,531
- You can finish it.

107
00:15:35,951 --> 00:15:38,370
I can't believe
they called us stoners.

108
00:15:38,453 --> 00:15:41,498
Dickheads.

109
00:15:41,581 --> 00:15:44,543
Are you sure
you know where we're going?

110
00:15:44,584 --> 00:15:47,379
Yeah. There was a map
at the gas station.

111
00:15:47,421 --> 00:15:49,506
Oh, I'm so tired already.

112
00:15:49,589 --> 00:15:52,759
I'm starving,
and I'm being eaten by ants.

113
00:15:52,843 --> 00:15:54,886
Are there any on my back?

114
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:58,433
No, nothing there.
Oh, hey-ho! I call it. Uh, squirrel.

115
00:15:58,474 --> 00:16:01,935
- Well, you said you were hungry, Carly.
- I don't think it's a squirrel.

116
00:16:01,977 --> 00:16:04,981
- It's a mink.
- Really? How do you know?

117
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:07,357
- Probably ran over it.

118
00:16:07,441 --> 00:16:11,695
In medical school, they make you
work on animal cadavers
before you get to the real thing.

119
00:16:11,778 --> 00:16:13,697
- It's a mink.
- Oh.

120
00:16:15,325 --> 00:16:17,534
It's a mink?

121
00:16:17,618 --> 00:16:20,205
I need to be in Raleigh by 7:00.

122
00:16:20,288 --> 00:16:23,248
Hmm. Better get
a move-on, then.

123
00:16:23,373 --> 00:16:25,877
You know, we should've
just taken her to New York.

124
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,463
No. You know how she loves
this outdoor stuff.

125
00:16:29,546 --> 00:16:31,508
Yeah.

126
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:34,426
If you ask me, though,
nature sucks.

127
00:16:34,468 --> 00:16:39,431
Well, the next time she gets dumped,
we'll take her to New York.

128
00:16:42,811 --> 00:16:45,104
Drop your pants.

129
00:16:45,187 --> 00:16:47,607
What?

130
00:16:47,649 --> 00:16:49,733
When do people
always show up, Evan?

131
00:16:49,817 --> 00:16:52,487
What are we doing?

132
00:16:52,571 --> 00:16:54,905
Consider it an experiment
in probability theory.

133
00:16:54,989 --> 00:16:56,907
Really?

134
00:16:59,494 --> 00:17:02,455
Mmm. I love you.

135
00:17:02,496 --> 00:17:04,458
I know.

136
00:17:04,499 --> 00:17:07,752
Now get them
trousers off, boy. Don't be a sissy.

137
00:17:07,835 --> 00:17:10,671
- All right.

138
00:17:12,506 --> 00:17:16,427
You know, I've been thinking
about this whole wedding thing...

139
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,971
and I think we should
take a trip down to Mexico.

140
00:17:19,013 --> 00:17:22,058
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm talking about a long weekend...

141
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:26,438
margaritas, the two of us
on a beach alone, sunset.

142
00:17:26,521 --> 00:17:30,901
And, you know,
I'm talking about just, just eloping.

143
00:17:30,984 --> 00:17:34,946
- You know what I mean?
- Uh, wait a second.

144
00:17:35,029 --> 00:17:37,366
You wanna know what I think?

145
00:17:37,449 --> 00:17:39,367
Yes, please.

146
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:43,122
- I think if you ever
want to get in my pants again,
- Affirmative.

147
00:17:43,205 --> 00:17:45,873
This is the last time
you use the "E" word.

148
00:17:45,957 --> 00:17:49,961
Okay? Okay.

149
00:17:50,044 --> 00:17:52,214
Yeah, it's a disgusting word.

150
00:17:52,298 --> 00:17:54,382
Hey, guys, hold on.

151
00:17:57,469 --> 00:18:00,513
Hey, is anyone up there?

152
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:04,226
Hello!

153
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:08,147
- There must be people nearby.
- Anyone up there?

154
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:12,192
- Somebody had to start it.

155
00:18:12,275 --> 00:18:14,236
Let's keep moving.

156
00:18:16,738 --> 00:18:18,657
Hello?

157
00:18:23,244 --> 00:18:25,498
Freaky.

158
00:18:29,543 --> 00:18:32,712
Oh, look at this.
It's fucked!

159
00:18:32,796 --> 00:18:36,342
Nothing. Nothing.

160
00:18:40,054 --> 00:18:42,056
Hey, did you find
anything to eat?

161
00:18:42,139 --> 00:18:44,724
They took all my Power Bars.

162
00:18:44,766 --> 00:18:47,562
Um, no.

163
00:18:47,603 --> 00:18:51,190
No. Sorry.

164
00:18:54,943 --> 00:18:58,740
Damn it. Scott and Carly
took all our friggin' sunscreen.

165
00:19:01,158 --> 00:19:03,369
Does he have any good CD's?

166
00:19:04,745 --> 00:19:08,583
Mmm. Definitely not.

167
00:19:12,879 --> 00:19:16,423
You know, I think this guy
must be some kind of doctor.

168
00:19:16,465 --> 00:19:20,470
Maybe we could get him to write us
some prescriptions when he gets back.

169
00:19:20,553 --> 00:19:23,681
He doesn't have
any smokes either.

170
00:19:23,765 --> 00:19:25,725
Almost out.

171
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,860
Evan?

172
00:19:47,497 --> 00:19:50,041
Evan? Where are you?

173
00:19:51,918 --> 00:19:54,128
Hey, baby,
what are you doing?

174
00:19:54,169 --> 00:19:58,967
I'm just... amusing myself.
Whoooo!

175
00:19:59,009 --> 00:20:01,803
You, uh, getting
anything there, chatty?

176
00:20:01,887 --> 00:20:04,222
No, nothing.
I'm gonna miss this thing.

177
00:20:04,306 --> 00:20:08,477
- Why didn't you just fly?
- I put all of my money
into that car back there.

178
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:12,981
Okay, forget eloping, but there is an idea we
should discuss about the band for our wedding.

179
00:20:13,064 --> 00:20:17,319
I think we should hire a... you know,
a Frank Sinatra-type, uh, lead singer...

180
00:20:17,402 --> 00:20:20,572
as opposed to
a James Brown-type lead singer...

181
00:20:20,655 --> 00:20:23,575
because, you know, really, let's be
honest, there's only oneJames Brown...

182
00:20:23,659 --> 00:20:26,994
and, you know, a faux James Brown
is really quite intolerable.

183
00:20:30,874 --> 00:20:34,628
Evan? Where are you?

184
00:20:34,711 --> 00:20:37,838
You pissing or something?

185
00:20:43,469 --> 00:20:45,389
Evan?

186
00:21:15,251 --> 00:21:19,548
You know, plus he'd be grinding his hips,
and my grandmother would be...

187
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:24,720
yes, revolted
but also strangely fascinated
in a completely disturbing way...

188
00:21:24,804 --> 00:21:27,264
and, um...

189
00:21:29,433 --> 00:21:31,393
Baby?

190
00:21:33,938 --> 00:21:36,815
Carly, I wa...
I was kidding.

191
00:21:36,898 --> 00:21:39,527
Carly?

192
00:21:42,989 --> 00:21:45,908
- Evan?

193
00:22:12,518 --> 00:22:15,897
Sweetheart?
Hey, guys, hold up!

194
00:22:15,938 --> 00:22:19,484
Guys, hold up
for a second, all right?

195
00:22:19,567 --> 00:22:23,237
Baby, seriously,
this isn't funny.

196
00:22:25,073 --> 00:22:27,492
- Jesus God!

197
00:22:27,575 --> 00:22:30,495
- Baby!

198
00:22:30,578 --> 00:22:34,249
- L...
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

199
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:37,168
I could've killed you, woman.
I'm-I'm extremely dangerous.

200
00:22:37,252 --> 00:22:39,963
You wanna know
why I love you so much?

201
00:22:40,046 --> 00:22:42,172
Because you're so fun
to play with.

202
00:22:42,257 --> 00:22:45,301
Is that why you love me?
That really scared me, baby.

203
00:22:45,385 --> 00:22:48,513
- I'm sorry.
- That really scared me.
Would you not do that?

204
00:22:48,596 --> 00:22:51,015
Hello.!

205
00:22:53,518 --> 00:22:55,979
Hello.!

206
00:22:59,149 --> 00:23:02,611
There's, uh, nothing
like stating the obvious, huh?

207
00:23:02,694 --> 00:23:06,990
- Hey, baby, look at this.

208
00:23:07,073 --> 00:23:11,828
Whoo! Hey, Carly, I think
this would be good time for you
to confront your fear of...

209
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:15,165
Don't!
Okay, that is not funny.

210
00:23:15,207 --> 00:23:17,375
Look who's scared now.

211
00:23:21,046 --> 00:23:23,006
- Sorry.
- Whatever.

212
00:23:23,048 --> 00:23:26,051
Just get me to a motel room...

213
00:23:26,134 --> 00:23:28,303
run me a very hot bath...

214
00:23:28,345 --> 00:23:32,015
and be prepared to provide me
with a lot of orgasms.

215
00:23:32,099 --> 00:23:35,519
- Oh!
- I think they need to be alone.

216
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,355
What do you expect?
They just got engaged.

217
00:23:38,438 --> 00:23:40,565
They're happy.
It's a hard thing to find.

218
00:23:40,649 --> 00:23:42,568
Yeah.

219
00:23:42,651 --> 00:23:44,695
- Got it?
- Limber tongue. Got it.

220
00:23:44,778 --> 00:23:46,697
You're stupid.

221
00:23:57,249 --> 00:24:00,043
Maybe we shouldn't
have left Francine and Evan.

222
00:24:00,085 --> 00:24:02,588
Don't worry. They're fine.

223
00:24:02,671 --> 00:24:05,758
- You guys okay?
- Super.

224
00:24:09,595 --> 00:24:12,431
Well, wait, guys.
This road isn't on here.

225
00:24:12,514 --> 00:24:15,392
That's because you don't have
the Redneck World Atlas.

226
00:24:15,476 --> 00:24:19,272
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh. I think
we've just been saved, kids.

227
00:24:19,356 --> 00:24:21,482
- Can I get a...

228
00:24:29,156 --> 00:24:32,827
- Make this quick.

229
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:35,539
Actually, maybe we
should keep walking.

230
00:24:35,622 --> 00:24:38,874
What? The next house is gonna have
a white picket fence?

231
00:24:38,916 --> 00:24:41,378
Yeah, if there is
a next house.

232
00:24:44,046 --> 00:24:46,258
- Hey.
- What?

233
00:25:03,608 --> 00:25:06,027
Hello?

234
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:09,030
All right, this isn't right.

235
00:25:09,113 --> 00:25:11,032
Hello?

236
00:25:16,704 --> 00:25:19,333
Hello? Anybody home?

237
00:25:22,043 --> 00:25:24,129
- Whoa, baby! Could you... Shh!

238
00:25:24,213 --> 00:25:26,756
Hey, hey, what are you doing?

239
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:30,635
I was gonna see if they had a phone.
You guys can wait out here if you want.

240
00:25:30,718 --> 00:25:33,304
You can't just go barging
into someone's house like that.

241
00:25:33,388 --> 00:25:36,140
Yeah, 'cause, you know,
I'm just thinkin'...

242
00:25:36,182 --> 00:25:38,851
West Virginia, trespassing...
not a great combination.

243
00:25:38,935 --> 00:25:41,187
Look, I need to pee.

244
00:25:41,271 --> 00:25:44,190
Well, I need to remind you
of a little movie called Deliverance.

245
00:25:47,485 --> 00:25:50,990
Guys, we got two wrecked cars.
I mean, we really need a phone.

246
00:25:59,622 --> 00:26:01,876
Hello?

247
00:26:01,959 --> 00:26:04,336
Hello?

248
00:26:04,419 --> 00:26:06,379
Carly.

249
00:26:12,177 --> 00:26:14,137
Hello?

250
00:26:29,946 --> 00:26:31,863
What the fuck?

251
00:26:31,947 --> 00:26:34,951
Let's just do
what we gotta do and get out ofhere.

252
00:26:37,953 --> 00:26:41,206
Hey, I am not sensing a phone here.

253
00:26:41,248 --> 00:26:43,500
Hello!

254
00:26:43,542 --> 00:26:46,170
Okay, who lives here?

255
00:26:46,212 --> 00:26:50,008
I don't know, but can you
help me find a bathroom?

256
00:26:50,049 --> 00:26:52,175
Baby, I think
this is the bathroom.

257
00:26:52,259 --> 00:26:57,015
Oh, fuck.

258
00:26:59,057 --> 00:27:01,895
Oh, my God.
Look at this place.

259
00:27:01,978 --> 00:27:04,730
Seriously, guys,
I think we should go.

260
00:27:04,813 --> 00:27:07,066
Help me find the bathroom.
Then we'll go.

261
00:27:07,108 --> 00:27:09,693
Baby, what if this place
belongs to some kind of cult?

262
00:27:09,735 --> 00:27:12,405
I read in Newsweek how
economically depressed places...

263
00:27:12,489 --> 00:27:15,699
are like breeding grounds for
all kinds of apocalyptic visionaries.

264
00:27:15,741 --> 00:27:18,536
Order of the Solar Temple, Church of
the Lamb of God, the Chijon family.

265
00:27:18,578 --> 00:27:21,038
- Remember them?
- Hey, brainiac!

266
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,041
Shh!

267
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:27,044
All right.
Maybe that door.

268
00:27:36,011 --> 00:27:38,431
- Christ!

269
00:27:38,473 --> 00:27:41,934
- You okay?
- It's just a paddle. It's all right.

270
00:27:45,772 --> 00:27:48,315
Whoa.

271
00:27:50,777 --> 00:27:53,404
God, look at this place.

272
00:27:53,446 --> 00:27:56,283
Yeah. It's like
the garage sale from hell.

273
00:27:56,366 --> 00:27:58,909
- Jesus.

274
00:28:00,996 --> 00:28:03,789
Can you believe this?

275
00:28:06,752 --> 00:28:10,338
Jesus, these guys
are ripping people off.

276
00:28:10,421 --> 00:28:14,842
I mean, this is like
$30,000 worth of stuff.

277
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,139
- Chris.
- Mm-hmm.

278
00:28:20,223 --> 00:28:22,684
We should leave.

279
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:27,147
This is kind of creepy.

280
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:33,445
- Yeah, this is it.
- Okay. Be quick.

281
00:28:33,487 --> 00:28:36,155
- Okay!
- All right? Two minutes.

282
00:28:36,239 --> 00:28:38,325
All right?
I'll be here.

283
00:29:46,309 --> 00:29:48,229
Ew.!

284
00:30:30,437 --> 00:30:32,482
Guys, guys, check this out.

285
00:30:34,067 --> 00:30:35,401
Oh, no.

286
00:30:39,155 --> 00:30:42,242
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Scott. Scott!

287
00:30:42,284 --> 00:30:44,911
- - Scott, we have to go now!

288
00:30:46,495 --> 00:30:48,748
- Jess! Jessie!
- Jess!

289
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:52,001
- Hey! Guys, what is it?
- We need to get back to your friends.

290
00:30:52,084 --> 00:30:53,253
- What about a phone?
- There is no phone. Shit!

291
00:30:53,253 --> 00:30:54,963
- What about a phone?
- There is no phone. Shit!

292
00:30:57,298 --> 00:31:00,635
There's a back door.
I saw a back door. Come on.

293
00:31:00,677 --> 00:31:02,636
- Go, go!

294
00:31:02,678 --> 00:31:07,475
- Okay, hurry. Shit! No!
- Shit!

295
00:31:07,558 --> 00:31:12,521
Scott.! Scott.!
It's not gonna budge.! Come on.!

296
00:37:25,775 --> 00:37:28,151
Go.

297
00:37:41,874 --> 00:37:43,418
Go.

298
00:37:58,516 --> 00:38:02,061
Go! Go!

299
00:38:02,144 --> 00:38:04,773
- Go! Go!
- Go! Go! Go! Go!

300
00:38:04,856 --> 00:38:07,691
- Go, you guys! Run!

301
00:38:07,733 --> 00:38:10,445
- Go quickly.
- Come on.

302
00:38:18,577 --> 00:38:21,081
- Where are they going?
- I don't know.

303
00:38:21,122 --> 00:38:24,542
Jesus, did that
really just happen?

304
00:38:24,583 --> 00:38:27,127
Do you think Evan's okay?

305
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,633
- Please.
- I can't. I can't.

306
00:38:32,716 --> 00:38:34,802
Carly, come on!
Get up!

307
00:38:34,885 --> 00:38:38,139
You didn't see what
they did to Francine!

308
00:38:38,222 --> 00:38:42,269
- You didn't see what we saw!
- Carly! Carly! Sweet pea!

309
00:38:42,352 --> 00:38:44,895
Look at me. We are gonna
get out of this, I swear to you.

310
00:38:44,979 --> 00:38:48,483
We are. Okay? We're gonna find a road.
We're gonna get to a town.

311
00:38:48,567 --> 00:38:53,113
And we're going home.
We're gonna get married. All right?

312
00:38:53,196 --> 00:38:55,823
And we are never
going into the woods again.

313
00:38:57,326 --> 00:38:59,494
- All right?
- We gotta go.

314
00:38:59,577 --> 00:39:02,331
- Come on. This way!
- Let's go! Come on!

315
00:39:17,011 --> 00:39:18,972
What is this?

316
00:39:29,525 --> 00:39:31,610
Jesus.

317
00:39:33,361 --> 00:39:35,322
All these people.

318
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:40,703
Baby. Fuck.

319
00:39:45,331 --> 00:39:48,668
How can they do this?
I don't understand.

320
00:39:48,751 --> 00:39:52,840
- How'd they get away with this?
- Oh, my God. All these people.

321
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:56,844
Maybe one of them still runs.
Look for keys.

322
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:59,180
None of these cars
are gonna run.

323
00:39:59,305 --> 00:40:03,017
Come on. Look at them.
Oh, fuck.

324
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:12,360
Get down! Get down!

325
00:40:12,443 --> 00:40:14,237
- Come on!
- Okay.

326
00:40:48,104 --> 00:40:50,398
What do we do?

327
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:52,692
- They left their truck running.
- So?

328
00:40:52,734 --> 00:40:55,360
- We gotta take it.
- How are we supposed to do that?

329
00:40:55,403 --> 00:40:58,406
One of us leads them
in the wrong direction...

330
00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:01,618
and the rest commandeer the truck
so they'll run for the runner.

331
00:41:03,369 --> 00:41:05,370
It's a classic military move.

332
00:41:05,412 --> 00:41:08,208
- Who goes?
- Me.

333
00:41:08,249 --> 00:41:12,045
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

334
00:41:12,087 --> 00:41:14,923
Over here!

335
00:41:22,472 --> 00:41:25,976
- Oh, shit. Oh, God.

336
00:41:28,603 --> 00:41:30,897
- Go!

337
00:41:30,939 --> 00:41:34,568
Listen. Help him. Get to the truck.
I'll meet you there.

338
00:41:34,651 --> 00:41:36,403
I love you.

339
00:41:36,444 --> 00:41:40,407
Fuckers!
Asshole motherfuckers!

340
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:42,575
Assholes!

341
00:41:45,162 --> 00:41:47,080
He's okay. Shh, shh.

342
00:41:58,175 --> 00:42:00,469
Come on.

343
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:10,478
Here, here. You're okay.

344
00:42:12,439 --> 00:42:15,316
Go ahead. Go, go, go.
Go to the truck.

345
00:42:19,112 --> 00:42:21,990
- Come on. We gotta go.

346
00:42:22,032 --> 00:42:25,285
- I can't.! I can't.!
- Come on! Come on!

347
00:42:25,327 --> 00:42:28,038
Carly, get in!

348
00:42:53,063 --> 00:42:56,358
We gotta find Scott!
We have to find Scott!

349
00:43:07,036 --> 00:43:09,579
Where is he?
Where is he!

350
00:43:12,792 --> 00:43:16,379
There he is!
There he is! Scott!

351
00:43:16,462 --> 00:43:20,216
Run, Scott.!
We're over here.! Scott.!

352
00:43:20,257 --> 00:43:23,844
- Scott.! Come on.!
- Scott, let's go!

353
00:43:23,928 --> 00:43:27,431
- Come on!

354
00:43:27,515 --> 00:43:30,726
- Come on, Scott! Scott!
- Let's go.!

355
00:43:30,768 --> 00:43:33,062
- Scott, come on!
- Come on, Scott!

356
00:43:33,104 --> 00:43:35,898
- Come on, Scott!
- Scott! Scott! What are you doing?

357
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:38,526
- Scott, what's wrong?
- Scott!

358
00:43:38,609 --> 00:43:40,653
Scott! No!

359
00:43:40,736 --> 00:43:43,614
- No!

360
00:43:43,698 --> 00:43:48,536
Let go of me.! Let me go.!

361
00:43:48,578 --> 00:43:51,706
Scott.!

362
00:43:51,789 --> 00:43:54,709
No!

363
00:43:57,045 --> 00:43:59,589
Drive! Drive!

364
00:43:59,672 --> 00:44:01,883
- No!
- Drive!

365
00:44:09,223 --> 00:44:11,142
Oh, God!

366
00:44:12,769 --> 00:44:15,271
What's happening?

367
00:44:40,171 --> 00:44:42,924
Oh, God, what's happening?

368
00:44:46,928 --> 00:44:51,933
Jess, please,
can we go back? Please!

369
00:44:52,017 --> 00:44:55,479
Carly, we have to
keep going. Okay?

370
00:44:59,483 --> 00:45:03,487
Scott.

371
00:45:20,879 --> 00:45:23,966
Are you sure this is
the road from that map?

372
00:45:24,049 --> 00:45:26,176
It's gotta go somewhere.

373
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:28,720
This better get us out of here.

374
00:45:34,351 --> 00:45:36,228
Shit.

375
00:45:40,816 --> 00:45:43,694
- Shit!
- Come on!

376
00:45:45,404 --> 00:45:48,824
- Back it up.

377
00:45:51,535 --> 00:45:55,164
- Come on!
- It's not gonna go any farther.
Come on. We have to get out.

378
00:45:59,001 --> 00:46:01,086
We gotta find out
where we are.

379
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:03,173
The highest ridge is up there.
Come on.

380
00:46:03,214 --> 00:46:06,217
What's the point?
They're gonna find us anyway.

381
00:46:06,258 --> 00:46:10,346
- Come on. Let's go, Carly.
- No. If he's going, I'm not.
He got us into this.

382
00:46:10,387 --> 00:46:13,809
Carly, look at me, okay?
Scott died protecting us.

383
00:46:13,892 --> 00:46:17,353
We need to keep ourselves alive,
or it was for nothing. Okay?

384
00:46:17,395 --> 00:46:19,688
We're all in this together, Carl.

385
00:46:19,730 --> 00:46:21,691
Come on.

386
00:46:21,732 --> 00:46:23,944
I want him back.

387
00:46:24,027 --> 00:46:26,195
Shh.

388
00:46:27,905 --> 00:46:29,908
I know, I know.

389
00:46:32,493 --> 00:46:35,038
- Carl, look at me. Okay? Look.

390
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:37,540
We're gonna stay alive.
We're gonna get out of this.

391
00:46:37,582 --> 00:46:42,211
We're gonna find the police and
make sure those motherfuckers
are punished for this. Okay?

392
00:46:45,841 --> 00:46:48,092
Carly.

393
00:46:48,134 --> 00:46:51,096
Come on, Carly.
You can do it.

394
00:46:52,805 --> 00:46:55,308
It's gonna get dark soon.
Come on.

395
00:46:58,978 --> 00:47:01,272
We need to find
that road quick.

396
00:47:01,314 --> 00:47:03,274
I know.

397
00:47:33,304 --> 00:47:35,266
Just a little bit farther.

398
00:47:39,770 --> 00:47:41,688
Chris!

399
00:47:43,606 --> 00:47:46,735
- It's a bear trap.

400
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:24,232
- What's up?
- I gotta rest.

401
00:48:34,033 --> 00:48:35,993
- Hey, guys.

402
00:48:36,076 --> 00:48:38,538
Look.

403
00:48:40,039 --> 00:48:43,709
Oh my God.
It's a watchtower.

404
00:48:48,297 --> 00:48:50,550
- Hello! Is anyone up there?
- Shh! Shh!

405
00:48:54,261 --> 00:48:57,056
- I don't think anyone's up there.
- Doesn't matter.

406
00:48:57,097 --> 00:49:00,059
It may have a phone or a radio.
Maybe we can see the road.

407
00:49:00,143 --> 00:49:01,728
You okay?

408
00:49:07,025 --> 00:49:09,026
Come on.

409
00:50:05,918 --> 00:50:08,795
Guys, I don't see
any roads or towns out there.

410
00:50:08,836 --> 00:50:11,382
Let's not stand by the window.
They might see us.

411
00:50:19,764 --> 00:50:22,142
- Hey.
- We're all gonna die.

412
00:50:23,935 --> 00:50:26,939
Carly, I need you to come help me
look around, please.

413
00:50:41,202 --> 00:50:43,372
Hey, Chris.

414
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:05,978
- Jess.
- Thanks.

415
00:51:44,392 --> 00:51:47,270
Oh, my God.
It's a radio.

416
00:51:51,398 --> 00:51:53,735
Thing looks prehistoric.

417
00:51:53,776 --> 00:51:56,528
- Do you know how to use this?
- Uh, let me try.

418
00:51:56,570 --> 00:52:00,200
- It could still work.
- Don't move anything.

419
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:03,077
- Keep it on the frequency they had it on.
- It works.

420
00:52:03,118 --> 00:52:06,247
Can anybody hear me? We have
an emergency. Can anybody hear me?

421
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:09,042
Say "Mayday."

422
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:12,128
Look, we have a huge emergency.
Please, does anybody hear me?

423
00:52:13,462 --> 00:52:15,548
Someone is injured.
We need help.

424
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:18,634
Hello. Please, is anybody
out there that can hear me?

425
00:52:18,717 --> 00:52:21,805
- Hello.
- No.

426
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:27,978
Get down.
Cover the light.

427
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:30,062
Shh.

428
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:46,621
I think they're passing us.

429
00:52:57,758 --> 00:52:59,676
This is Ranger Base Emergency.
Do you copy?

430
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:03,680
- What is your position? Over.

431
00:53:03,764 --> 00:53:06,308
Do you copy?
What is your position? Over.

432
00:53:06,391 --> 00:53:09,812
- I don't know my position. Just help us.
- Shh.!

433
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:13,147
I need another copy of that.
I repeat. What is your position?

434
00:53:13,232 --> 00:53:15,359
They're coming.

435
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:22,866
We don't know our position.
We're in a watchtower.

436
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:25,452
We must be north
of Bear Mountain Road.

437
00:53:25,536 --> 00:53:29,330
Someone is trying to kill us!
They've murdered our friends!
They're after us right now!

438
00:53:29,415 --> 00:53:32,126
I'm having
some trouble hearing you.

439
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:34,460
If you're in the tower, stay there.
Do you copy?

440
00:53:34,502 --> 00:53:36,839
Yes, we copy! Just hurry, please!
This is an emergency!

441
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:39,716
- Help me move this. Come on! Come on!
- We'll come to you.

442
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:42,219
They're after us.!
Someone's been shot.!

443
00:53:42,303 --> 00:53:45,472
Our friends have been killed,
and we need help.! Please.!

444
00:53:45,514 --> 00:53:47,850
Fuck!

445
00:54:13,334 --> 00:54:15,253
What are they doing?

446
00:54:15,336 --> 00:54:17,338
I don't know.

447
00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:23,594
I think they're going down.

448
00:54:23,678 --> 00:54:25,263
Jess.

449
00:54:40,069 --> 00:54:43,406
Hello? Hello?
Is anybody there?

450
00:54:43,489 --> 00:54:45,700
Can you hear us? Hello?

451
00:55:16,106 --> 00:55:19,609
- Jesus, what are they doing?
- We're on fire.

452
00:55:19,693 --> 00:55:22,070
They're trying to burn us out.

453
00:55:24,114 --> 00:55:27,158
Oh, my God.

454
00:55:37,210 --> 00:55:39,629
Carly.!

455
00:55:39,713 --> 00:55:43,258
- Come here!
- Let go of me! Let go!

456
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:46,678
I'd rather jump than burn to death!

457
00:55:48,388 --> 00:55:51,016
- Calm down.
- You're right.

458
00:55:51,099 --> 00:55:53,769
- What?
- She's right.

459
00:55:53,810 --> 00:55:57,439
- We have to jump. Those branches
are only a few feet down.
- That's more like 20 feet.

460
00:55:57,481 --> 00:56:01,151
I don't want to burn, and I don't want to
be chopped into pieces. We can do this.

461
00:56:01,234 --> 00:56:03,362
I'll go first.

462
00:56:03,445 --> 00:56:05,364
Chris. Hey.

463
00:56:20,254 --> 00:56:24,466
Oh.

464
00:56:53,245 --> 00:56:56,373
Aaah! Chris!
Chris! Aaah!

465
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:00,669
- Chris!

466
00:57:25,528 --> 00:57:28,030
- You okay?
- Do you think they saw us?

467
00:57:28,114 --> 00:57:31,367
I don't know.

468
00:57:37,749 --> 00:57:40,376
We gotta move.
Come on.

469
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:42,629
Shit. Shit.

470
00:58:00,730 --> 00:58:02,649
Carly, come on.

471
00:59:08,633 --> 00:59:12,094
I can do this.
I can do this. I can do this.

472
00:59:12,177 --> 00:59:14,973
I can...
I can do this.

473
00:59:16,974 --> 00:59:19,142
- Car...

474
00:59:36,536 --> 00:59:38,662
- Shh.

475
00:59:41,499 --> 00:59:45,085
- Come on. Come on.

476
01:00:05,731 --> 01:00:09,194
- He's coming.
- I know. I have a plan. Come on.

477
01:00:16,742 --> 01:00:18,745
Jessie, this way.

478
01:00:42,686 --> 01:00:44,729
- Can you hold this?
- Why?

479
01:00:44,854 --> 01:00:48,066
'Cause we're gonna knock this fucker
out of the tree. Can you hold it?

480
01:00:49,901 --> 01:00:53,072
- Yeah.
- All right. Don't let go
until I say so. Okay?

481
01:00:53,155 --> 01:00:57,076
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna make sure he comes this way.

482
01:00:57,117 --> 01:00:59,827
- No. You can't move as quick as I can.
- Jessie.

483
01:00:59,911 --> 01:01:02,831
Jessie.

484
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:25,688
I'm right here!
Come and get me!

485
01:01:29,066 --> 01:01:31,193
Where are you?

486
01:01:34,697 --> 01:01:36,741
Here I am!

487
01:02:09,399 --> 01:02:12,193
- What...

488
01:02:23,413 --> 01:02:26,165
- Hmm?

489
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:35,758
- Hey!

490
01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:16,735
Sorry about your friends.

491
01:04:19,488 --> 01:04:23,117
Last Friday I came home,
and there's a message on my machine...

492
01:04:24,285 --> 01:04:27,288
from my boyfriend, who...

493
01:04:27,371 --> 01:04:30,583
says that we shouldn't
be together anymore.

494
01:04:33,836 --> 01:04:38,257
Within 20 minutes
of me... telling Carly...

495
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:45,473
she had Scott and...
Evan and Francine...

496
01:04:45,514 --> 01:04:48,517
all blowing off work this week
to take me out here.

497
01:04:49,727 --> 01:04:52,188
That's just the kind
of friends they were.

498
01:04:55,524 --> 01:04:57,526
And now they're dead.

499
01:05:06,953 --> 01:05:09,204
It's not your fault.

500
01:05:10,998 --> 01:05:13,000
It's not.

501
01:05:38,776 --> 01:05:40,778
They're here!

502
01:05:48,536 --> 01:05:51,539
No, they're not.
You were dreaming.

503
01:05:53,416 --> 01:05:56,044
I wish.

504
01:06:40,088 --> 01:06:42,758
- How's your leg?
- It hurts.

505
01:06:42,841 --> 01:06:46,596
Which is good.
If it didn't hurt... Road.

506
01:06:46,679 --> 01:06:48,764
- What?
- Road. Look.

507
01:06:48,805 --> 01:06:52,476
- We gotta get down there.
- Take that slope right there.

508
01:06:56,271 --> 01:06:58,649
I can't believe it.

509
01:06:58,732 --> 01:07:02,277
- How are we gonna get you down?
- I'll get down...

510
01:07:03,654 --> 01:07:06,365
- Chris!
- Go!

511
01:07:06,448 --> 01:07:09,618
- Chris! No! Chris!

512
01:07:10,702 --> 01:07:13,665
Chris.! Chris.!

513
01:07:13,748 --> 01:07:17,710
Chris! Get off of me!

514
01:07:20,504 --> 01:07:22,131
- Jessie!

515
01:07:22,172 --> 01:07:25,050
Jessie!

516
01:07:34,101 --> 01:07:37,521
Hey, stop!
Oh, thank God!

517
01:07:37,563 --> 01:07:39,523
Are you crazy?

518
01:07:39,565 --> 01:07:42,401
- They took her. Come on. We gotta...
- Just calm down.

519
01:07:42,485 --> 01:07:45,655
- We gotta move.
- Are you one of them folks
who called me from the fire tower?

520
01:07:45,697 --> 01:07:49,492
- Will you shut up and listen.
People are dead!
- Dead? What people?

521
01:10:03,669 --> 01:10:06,547
Help.!

522
01:10:06,631 --> 01:10:08,674
No!

523
01:10:12,220 --> 01:10:15,305
- Mmm.
- No.

524
01:10:19,893 --> 01:10:21,980
Help me. Please.

525
01:10:23,356 --> 01:10:26,316
Help me. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

526
01:10:26,358 --> 01:10:30,988
I'm sorry. Yeah?
Can you help me?

527
01:10:31,030 --> 01:10:33,074
Please help me.

528
01:10:34,284 --> 01:10:36,368
No!

529
01:10:37,911 --> 01:10:39,414
No!

530
01:10:55,514 --> 01:11:01,103
Help.

531
01:11:58,159 --> 01:12:01,121
Somebody, help me!

532
01:12:04,875 --> 01:12:06,919
No!

533
01:12:29,232 --> 01:12:31,027
Help me!

534
01:13:25,957 --> 01:13:29,334
- You're okay. Come on.

535
01:13:29,376 --> 01:13:32,839
Just stay with me. You're all right.
Come on. It's okay.

536
01:13:32,881 --> 01:13:35,507
Keep looking at me.
All right? You're okay.

537
01:13:35,549 --> 01:13:38,595
- Thank you.
- Shh. Everything's okay.

538
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:46,603
- Chris.!
-

539
01:14:38,530 --> 01:14:40,949
- Chris!

540
01:15:32,918 --> 01:15:35,838
- Chris.

541
01:15:47,516 --> 01:15:50,227
- Get off of me!

542
01:16:03,157 --> 01:16:05,159
Shoot them.

543
01:16:05,243 --> 01:16:07,495
I only got one shot left.

544
01:16:14,502 --> 01:16:19,173
Come on, you motherfuckers.
Just die.
