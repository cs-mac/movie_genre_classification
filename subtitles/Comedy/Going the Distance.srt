1
00:00:06,665 --> 00:00:08,724
For us to push back from the gate...

2
00:00:08,901 --> 00:00:10,391
...make sure seatbelts are fastened...

3
00:00:10,569 --> 00:00:14,596
...tray tables in their locked position,
and your luggage is completely stowed.

4
00:00:14,773 --> 00:00:18,675
We'd like to thank you all for flying with us.
Welcome aboard.

5
00:01:10,996 --> 00:01:14,397
Flight 82 to San
Francisco is ready for boarding at Gate...

6
00:01:14,566 --> 00:01:18,468
Flight 63
to New York now boarding at Gate 41.

7
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:38,549
If you'd like to make a call...

8
00:02:08,887 --> 00:02:11,481
- So...
- So...

9
00:02:11,657 --> 00:02:14,023
- Happy birthday.
- Oh.

10
00:02:14,192 --> 00:02:15,921
Thank you...

11
00:02:16,194 --> 00:02:17,456
...for the takeout.

12
00:02:17,629 --> 00:02:18,755
Sure.

13
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,125
It's the least I could do.
It's your birthday.

14
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,094
- Heh. So?
- Oh, yeah, right.

15
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,500
But Dan's home
so we gotta go to the bedroom.

16
00:02:27,673 --> 00:02:30,164
Oh. Are we done in here?

17
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:32,438
Yeah, well, we finished eating.

18
00:02:35,213 --> 00:02:36,373
What?

19
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:39,982
I just thought
that this might be a great moment...

20
00:02:40,152 --> 00:02:42,211
...for you to give me my gift.

21
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:46,951
Oh, shit.

22
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:50,219
Amy, I didn't get you anything.

23
00:02:51,697 --> 00:02:54,257
You told me that you didn't want me
to get you anything.

24
00:02:55,534 --> 00:02:57,468
What's happening? Oh, God.

25
00:02:57,636 --> 00:02:58,660
- Are you crying?
- No.

26
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:03,499
I have missed something here, baby.
So you wanted a present?

27
00:03:03,675 --> 00:03:06,508
Garrett,
I tell you not to get me something...

28
00:03:06,678 --> 00:03:08,942
...so you want to get me something
really great...

29
00:03:09,114 --> 00:03:11,810
...because I'm the girlfriend
that didn't ask for anything.

30
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:15,646
What? Okay, you know what, let's go.
I'll get you something now.

31
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:17,880
It is not about the goddamn gift.

32
00:03:18,056 --> 00:03:21,150
It just was about the gift.
When did it become not about the gift?

33
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:25,319
It's bigger than this.
It's a combination of a lot of things.

34
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:29,691
I've invested so much in this relationship
and I don't feeI like you're doing the same.

35
00:03:30,302 --> 00:03:33,430
I don't even know if you're into this.
Are you?

36
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,070
- Sure.
- Oh, my God.

37
00:03:37,242 --> 00:03:38,641
Ah, Amy, come on.

38
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:42,337
- Don't even think about calling me again.
- Oh, Jesus. Amy, wait, wait, wait.

39
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:44,846
I should not call you
or I should want to call you?

40
00:03:46,051 --> 00:03:49,817
Okay, so it means what it means. Good.

41
00:03:57,863 --> 00:04:00,696
- Ow! Oh, my God. Mother bitch.
- Erin, you're late.

42
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:04,302
Thanks, Brandy.
I almost forgot why I was running.

43
00:04:09,908 --> 00:04:11,705
Did he use the red pen with you guys?

44
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:13,139
No.

45
00:04:16,314 --> 00:04:18,373
- Well, it's impressive reporting.
- Thank you.

46
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,485
However,
needs to be completely restructured.

47
00:04:21,653 --> 00:04:23,621
And a spellcheck wouldn't hurt.

48
00:04:23,789 --> 00:04:26,656
"MunincibaI" courthouse?
Not sure where that is.

49
00:04:27,459 --> 00:04:29,154
Thank you, ladies.

50
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:39,901
- Where are you going?
- I'm 31. I'm an intern.

51
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:42,232
- I'm going to get wasted.
- Oh, I'm so in.

52
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:43,874
Let's go.

53
00:04:44,442 --> 00:04:46,535
I'd love a copilot. Look at this shit.

54
00:04:46,711 --> 00:04:48,770
Oh, my God, he bled on it.

55
00:04:52,851 --> 00:04:54,842
I still can't believe
she broke up with me.

56
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,750
- Of course she did, dumb-ass.
- Because I didn't get a gift?

57
00:04:57,923 --> 00:04:58,947
It's not the gift.

58
00:04:59,124 --> 00:05:00,853
- Don't think it's the gift.
- It's not.

59
00:05:01,026 --> 00:05:03,688
How does everyone except me
know it's not about the gift?

60
00:05:03,862 --> 00:05:06,729
- Oh. Dude, are you kidding me?
- All right, hang on a second, man.

61
00:05:06,898 --> 00:05:09,526
I get it, all right?
It's a tough thing to get dumped.

62
00:05:09,701 --> 00:05:12,761
You get upset, you go to your room,
you turn off all the lights...

63
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:15,406
...you light a candle
and you just, like you know...

64
00:05:15,574 --> 00:05:18,441
...go to that deep emotionaI place
where you're like:

65
00:05:22,581 --> 00:05:24,481
- Is that really how you cry?
Yes.

66
00:05:24,649 --> 00:05:26,310
Are you going through that?
Have you cried?

67
00:05:26,484 --> 00:05:30,147
- Uh, I didn't cry. I've never cried like that.
- I cry like that all the time.

68
00:05:30,322 --> 00:05:33,723
I've only really cried over a girI
in, like, high schooI, maybe.

69
00:05:33,892 --> 00:05:36,326
I don't know.
Maybe you weren't into that chick.

70
00:05:36,494 --> 00:05:40,191
Because I didn't cry, it means I'm not-
No, I liked her. Of course I liked her.

71
00:05:40,365 --> 00:05:43,027
And we were good together.
I don't know what happened.

72
00:05:43,201 --> 00:05:45,032
- I don't know what happened.
Aw, dude.

73
00:05:45,203 --> 00:05:46,670
- This happens every time.
- What?

74
00:05:46,838 --> 00:05:49,466
You get in a relationship
but you don't fully commit.

75
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:51,740
You never have,
not since I've known you.

76
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,844
The girI figures that out and she splits.

77
00:05:54,012 --> 00:05:57,448
And then we have to sit here
and listen to you be surprised about that.

78
00:05:57,616 --> 00:06:00,278
- Over and over again. This happens a lot.
- All the time.

79
00:06:00,452 --> 00:06:02,613
It's not true. It happens occasionally.

80
00:06:02,787 --> 00:06:04,049
There's a definite pattern.

81
00:06:04,222 --> 00:06:05,746
- Definite pattern.
You know what?

82
00:06:05,924 --> 00:06:08,484
Fuck you, fuck you.
I'm gonna go clear my head.

83
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,390
- A lot of self-righteousness going on.
- You gonna cry it out?

84
00:06:11,563 --> 00:06:13,622
I'm not crying, just gonna clear my head.

85
00:06:13,798 --> 00:06:15,891
Clear your head, cry, same thing.

86
00:06:16,067 --> 00:06:18,331
You know what I'm talking about
with the man cry.

87
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:19,800
Like that low, like:

88
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:27,076
I don't know. If you ask me, that looks
like you're trying to suck your own dick.

89
00:06:27,379 --> 00:06:28,778
- That does not-
- Yes, it does.

90
00:06:28,947 --> 00:06:30,437
If I wasn't making any noise...

91
00:06:30,615 --> 00:06:33,049
...and you saw me like this,
what does it look like?

92
00:06:33,318 --> 00:06:36,014
Looks like you're trying to suck your dick.
That's not how.

93
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:39,748
When I suck my dick, I lie on my back,
I throw my legs over my head.

94
00:06:42,227 --> 00:06:43,990
- You suck your own dick?
- Yeah.

95
00:06:44,162 --> 00:06:46,392
You cut your hair
and you suck your own dick.

96
00:06:46,564 --> 00:06:48,031
You're like a Swiss army knife.

97
00:06:58,643 --> 00:07:01,441
Hey, we should circulate.
There's hot guys everywhere.

98
00:07:01,613 --> 00:07:02,875
You're being lame.

99
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:04,515
What would you rather I do?

100
00:07:04,683 --> 00:07:07,652
Get date-raped by a frat guy
with a popped collar?

101
00:07:07,819 --> 00:07:08,979
No, thank you.

102
00:07:09,154 --> 00:07:10,746
You are just jealous.

103
00:07:10,922 --> 00:07:13,322
- More for you, baby.
Thank you.

104
00:07:13,491 --> 00:07:15,925
Go have fun being in The Accused.

105
00:07:16,628 --> 00:07:17,890
Hey.
- Hey.

106
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:20,395
I like your shirt.
- I know. It's Polo.

107
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,359
You smell good.

108
00:07:22,534 --> 00:07:24,661
- It's Axe.
- I know.

109
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:39,346
You might as well remove that quarter.
I have no intention of getting off this game.

110
00:07:43,054 --> 00:07:44,078
Listen-

111
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:45,347
- Oh, my God.
- What?

112
00:07:45,523 --> 00:07:46,922
- Who does that?
- What the fuck?

113
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:49,788
- What the fuck are you doing?
- What the fuck are you doing?

114
00:07:49,961 --> 00:07:53,226
Who leans in like that?
I was just about to beat the high score.

115
00:07:53,398 --> 00:07:56,697
There's no way you got that close to ERL.
I've never gotten that close.

116
00:07:56,868 --> 00:07:59,234
You know how long
I've been trying to beat myself?

117
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,132
I mean, what a dick move.

118
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,871
Wait, what?

119
00:08:04,743 --> 00:08:06,074
What the f-?

120
00:08:06,244 --> 00:08:09,873
What? Hold on. Hold on. You're ERL?
You're the dragon?

121
00:08:10,315 --> 00:08:11,475
I'm a what?

122
00:08:11,683 --> 00:08:14,777
I've been chasing ERL for months now.
I just thought ERL was an-

123
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:18,081
I thought ERL was an "EarI," you know.

124
00:08:18,256 --> 00:08:21,817
Erin Rankin Langford.
Nobody calls me ERL.

125
00:08:21,993 --> 00:08:24,325
I'm honored, okay. I am honored.

126
00:08:24,496 --> 00:08:27,124
Shit, what a dick. I leaned in.

127
00:08:27,499 --> 00:08:29,899
I owe you a beer.
Please let me get you a beer.

128
00:08:30,068 --> 00:08:32,502
Look, I'm sitting right over there,
we got a pitcher.

129
00:08:32,704 --> 00:08:37,437
I'd feeI like shit if you don't have a beer
with me. One Centipedophile to another.

130
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:39,838
All right.

131
00:08:40,011 --> 00:08:42,741
- I feeI like you're not listening to me.
- I am listening.

132
00:08:42,914 --> 00:08:45,940
I'm trying to figure this out.
I can't tell if they're together.

133
00:08:46,117 --> 00:08:48,176
I think they're on their first date. Tall.

134
00:08:48,353 --> 00:08:51,516
Yes, I see them. They're tall.
But are you not afraid about what's-

135
00:08:51,723 --> 00:08:54,624
- I bet the blond played college sports.
- Can you pay attention?

136
00:08:54,793 --> 00:08:57,660
There are no baby pigeons in the city.
Not one.

137
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:59,820
You guys, uh, I want you to meet Erin.

138
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:02,262
Uh, Erin, these are my friends.
This is Box and Dan.

139
00:09:02,434 --> 00:09:04,129
Hi. How are you?

140
00:09:04,302 --> 00:09:05,530
- Hey.
- Hello.

141
00:09:05,737 --> 00:09:08,831
I screwed up Erin's Centipede game
so I owe her a beer.

142
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:10,941
Fucker put his face
in front of the game.

143
00:09:11,109 --> 00:09:12,542
- What? Who does that?
Oh.

144
00:09:12,744 --> 00:09:14,837
- Exactly.
- Well, it wasn't that bad.

145
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,542
Check, one.

146
00:09:16,748 --> 00:09:18,215
Okay, everyone, people.

147
00:09:18,917 --> 00:09:22,614
It is time for tonight's round
of bar trivia.

148
00:09:25,957 --> 00:09:28,790
So you know the rules.
Uh, just teams of two.

149
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,291
No fighting, no g-

150
00:09:31,663 --> 00:09:35,121
Oh! Shit!
Terry, I just got shocked by this mike.

151
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,063
Well, then don't put your face on it.

152
00:09:37,268 --> 00:09:39,862
I do not have health care, Terry.

153
00:09:40,271 --> 00:09:44,105
Hey, listen, these two get really moody
and emotionaI when they're separated...

154
00:09:44,275 --> 00:09:46,140
- ... so do you wanna team up?
Sure.

155
00:09:46,311 --> 00:09:49,337
Just don't drag me down, okay?
You don't seem very smart.

156
00:09:50,682 --> 00:09:54,550
What country has the driest inhabited area
in the world?

157
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,016
Is it A, Syria-?

158
00:09:56,187 --> 00:09:57,279
Egypt.

159
00:09:57,455 --> 00:10:01,391
Okay, let me read all the choices
before you answer.

160
00:10:01,926 --> 00:10:03,553
Egypt, the answer's Egypt.

161
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,696
Nice. Oh, my God.

162
00:10:05,864 --> 00:10:09,061
What album holds the record
for most weeks on the Billboard 200?

163
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:10,565
Dark Side of the Moon.

164
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:14,034
- Terry, they keep interrupting me.
Then speak faster.

165
00:10:14,205 --> 00:10:16,605
Seven hundred and 41 weeks,
in case you're curious.

166
00:10:16,774 --> 00:10:19,607
You suck at everything else.
It's good you know something.

167
00:10:19,777 --> 00:10:22,473
Yeah, well, I better not suck at that.
It's part of my job.

168
00:10:22,647 --> 00:10:25,115
I work at DieseI Records. It's a labeI.

169
00:10:26,017 --> 00:10:27,075
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

170
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:29,117
The word "records"
kind of tipped me off.

171
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,719
What do you do for work?

172
00:10:30,889 --> 00:10:32,823
I work at The New York Sentinel
newspaper.

173
00:10:32,991 --> 00:10:34,652
- Oh, yeah?
- It's a newspaper.

174
00:10:34,826 --> 00:10:37,522
How many different ways
can you make change for a dollar?

175
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:40,960
Ah! A dollar, if ripped, has no value.

176
00:10:41,132 --> 00:10:42,599
Disqualified.

177
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,564
Great, nine weeks in a row.

178
00:10:44,969 --> 00:10:47,733
- You got a little wing sauce, like- Um-
- Where?

179
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:50,305
Kind of in this generaI area.

180
00:10:50,475 --> 00:10:52,602
The Rolling Stones took their name
from what-?

181
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:55,143
Muddy Waters!
- Fuck you!

182
00:11:02,887 --> 00:11:03,911
Oh, yeah.

183
00:11:04,088 --> 00:11:06,147
Oh, wow.

184
00:11:06,324 --> 00:11:08,053
Jesus, Snoop.

185
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,554
So you a big fan of Tom Cruise?

186
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:14,897
Uh, in my defense, I'm a big Top Gun fan.

187
00:11:15,066 --> 00:11:17,091
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

188
00:11:17,268 --> 00:11:21,796
In fact, I like all homoerotic,
fighter-pilot movies.

189
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:26,136
- Too much? Did I lose you?
- No, no.

190
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:29,405
Is Top Gun like your favorite movie?

191
00:11:29,581 --> 00:11:31,845
- It's up there. What's wrong with that?
- Nothing.

192
00:11:32,016 --> 00:11:33,847
- It's the greatest.
- Yeah. It's awesome.

193
00:11:34,018 --> 00:11:35,610
Wait, what's your favorite movie?

194
00:11:35,787 --> 00:11:38,654
Actually, I'm gonna be really serious
right now for a minute.

195
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,552
- Okay, hold on.
- Ha-ha-ha.

196
00:11:42,126 --> 00:11:44,594
I really wanna tell you
what my favorite movie is.

197
00:11:45,029 --> 00:11:48,157
Oh, God. Please don't say, like,
Triumph of the Will.

198
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:52,269
Don't be like a closet Nazi
or something weird...

199
00:11:52,437 --> 00:11:54,371
...because this is going great.

200
00:11:55,873 --> 00:11:57,465
It's Shawshank.

201
00:12:01,813 --> 00:12:03,974
I hope I make it across the border.

202
00:12:04,649 --> 00:12:07,049
I hope to see my friend
and shake his hand.

203
00:12:07,719 --> 00:12:10,586
I hope the Pacific is as blue
as it has been in my dreams.

204
00:12:10,755 --> 00:12:13,485
- Ha-ha-ha.
- I hope.

205
00:12:14,058 --> 00:12:16,026
- Zihuatanejo.
- Zihuatanejo.

206
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:17,786
The best.

207
00:12:26,838 --> 00:12:31,104
Watching every motion
In my foolish lover's game

208
00:12:31,276 --> 00:12:33,335
- Where's that coming from?
- Dan.

209
00:12:33,511 --> 00:12:35,843
- How in the fuck is Top Gun music playing?
- Dan!

210
00:12:36,014 --> 00:12:38,141
Hey, Garrett.
- I'm so sorry.

211
00:12:38,316 --> 00:12:40,341
I forgot to tell you
that Dan's my roommate.

212
00:12:40,518 --> 00:12:41,985
You guys live together?

213
00:12:42,453 --> 00:12:44,353
- Uh, yeah.
- Hey, Dan!

214
00:12:44,522 --> 00:12:45,648
Hello in there.

215
00:12:45,857 --> 00:12:47,757
- Heh.
- Uh...

216
00:12:47,925 --> 00:12:49,017
Dan, what are you doing?

217
00:12:49,427 --> 00:12:51,861
Watching every motion
in my foolish lover's game?

218
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:54,656
What was our rule?

219
00:12:54,832 --> 00:12:58,063
Because I can hear through the wall
doesn't mean I get to participate.

220
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:01,262
Right,
and what were you doing just now?

221
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:03,366
Participating.
- Okay.

222
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:07,773
Look, man, I just thought maybe,
you know, it'd be fun if I DJ'd your hookup.

223
00:13:07,945 --> 00:13:11,142
So is this, like, what you guys do
when you bring girls over?

224
00:13:11,316 --> 00:13:13,614
- He DJs your hookup?
- No.

225
00:13:13,785 --> 00:13:16,049
Is that what this fucking frat house
is all about?

226
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,347
No, no. Listen, I'm really sorry.

227
00:13:18,523 --> 00:13:21,117
- I'm gonna go.
- Listen, listen, listen. I can explain.

228
00:13:21,292 --> 00:13:22,725
Yeah? Explain.

229
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:26,864
You know what? I can't. I really have
no save here. He is a fucking moron.

230
00:13:27,031 --> 00:13:29,829
That's okay, because, you know what?
I was totally pretending to be mad.

231
00:13:30,001 --> 00:13:31,593
I didn't want you to think I was slutty.

232
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,361
- I don't care.
- Oh.

233
00:13:33,538 --> 00:13:35,802
- Think it's kind of awesome.
- Well, that's weird.

234
00:13:35,973 --> 00:13:38,464
- In fact, Dan, take me to Berlin.
Here it comes!

235
00:13:38,643 --> 00:13:42,773
Take my breath away

236
00:13:48,586 --> 00:13:52,920
Take my breath away

237
00:14:16,581 --> 00:14:18,708
Hey. Morning.

238
00:14:18,883 --> 00:14:19,907
Good morning.

239
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:25,486
Um, if you're taking off, could you at least
leave the money on the nightstand?

240
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:29,121
Oh. I wasn't, um, trying to sneak out.

241
00:14:29,293 --> 00:14:32,262
No. You're just putting your clothes on
really quietly...

242
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:34,625
...and tiptoeing across the floor.

243
00:14:36,434 --> 00:14:39,096
- Yeah.
- It's all right.

244
00:14:39,604 --> 00:14:41,003
I can stay.

245
00:14:49,781 --> 00:14:51,612
- I didn't mean you had to-
- Okay, yeah.

246
00:14:51,783 --> 00:14:53,148
That didn't feeI good.

247
00:14:53,317 --> 00:14:56,650
Hey, hey.
You wanna maybe get some breakfast?

248
00:14:58,089 --> 00:14:59,886
Food would be good.

249
00:15:00,057 --> 00:15:01,285
Okay.

250
00:15:01,459 --> 00:15:07,625
Now I've had the time of my life

251
00:15:07,965 --> 00:15:09,728
No, I've never felt

252
00:15:09,901 --> 00:15:11,960
- Dan.
Hello.

253
00:15:22,513 --> 00:15:23,912
I had a great time last night.

254
00:15:25,082 --> 00:15:28,210
I gotta say, that was- It's a lot of fun.

255
00:15:28,453 --> 00:15:29,943
Me too.

256
00:15:30,655 --> 00:15:32,213
So I should get your number.

257
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:35,416
You know, we'd maybe hang out again?

258
00:15:35,593 --> 00:15:38,323
- Okay.
- All right. I have a nap- No.

259
00:15:38,496 --> 00:15:40,521
- Here, I got it.
- Okay.

260
00:15:41,132 --> 00:15:44,533
- Um, there's a caveat that...
- Mm-hm.

261
00:15:44,836 --> 00:15:48,033
...I'd really... Um...

262
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:51,174
I'm leaving in six weeks.

263
00:15:51,342 --> 00:15:55,369
And when I said that I work
at The Sentinel...

264
00:15:55,546 --> 00:15:57,446
...I meant that I'm a summer intern.

265
00:15:58,015 --> 00:16:02,748
And I'm actually going back to Stanford
to finish up my last year of grad schooI.

266
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,083
And although I'd be psyched
to hang out again...

267
00:16:06,624 --> 00:16:12,062
...um, please know that
I'm not looking to start up-

268
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:16,223
Oh, wait. Uh, no, me-?
I just got out of a relationship.

269
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:18,865
- Oh. Really, when?
- Yeah.

270
00:16:20,137 --> 00:16:22,002
Um...

271
00:16:23,407 --> 00:16:26,137
I'm not gonna tell you
that it was last night...

272
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:30,110
...but I'm not gonna say
that it wasn't either.

273
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:32,715
- Okay, good.
- Yeah. Yep.

274
00:16:32,884 --> 00:16:35,045
Well, then we know
where each other stands.

275
00:16:35,486 --> 00:16:38,887
Um, the added bonus is that I now know
you're a male whore.

276
00:16:39,223 --> 00:16:42,715
Yeah. I guess I- It seems like I am.

277
00:16:43,494 --> 00:16:44,620
Here's my phone number.

278
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,494
That's awesome.

279
00:16:47,231 --> 00:16:50,200
Best posture in the office, Allison.
Seriously. Best one we got.

280
00:16:50,368 --> 00:16:51,392
There he is.

281
00:16:51,569 --> 00:16:52,763
- How you doing?
- Hey.

282
00:16:52,937 --> 00:16:54,564
Hey, I got a question for you, man.

283
00:16:54,739 --> 00:16:58,300
How does someone like you end up getting
dumped and laid on the same night?

284
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:02,879
How is that possible? I mean, from all of us
sad, lonely and bitter people...

285
00:17:03,047 --> 00:17:05,106
...I encourage you
to eat a big bowI of dick.

286
00:17:05,716 --> 00:17:06,774
- Really? How about this?
- Mm-hm.

287
00:17:06,951 --> 00:17:08,748
How about, "Good morning, Garrett"?

288
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,787
- Morning, Garrett.
- How you doing? What's with the luggage?

289
00:17:11,956 --> 00:17:15,153
Um, my flight from Miami got in at 5 a. m.
I haven't even slept.

290
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:17,317
You would never know.
You look well-slept.

291
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:19,463
Oh, thank you. Heh.

292
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,188
How's, uh...?

293
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:22,830
- Mark-
- Mark.

294
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:24,763
- is great.

295
00:17:24,936 --> 00:17:28,702
Uh, seeing him once every six weeks
for 48 hours, not so great.

296
00:17:28,873 --> 00:17:30,932
- Yeah.
- Garrett? Can you come here a sec?

297
00:17:31,275 --> 00:17:32,435
- Yeah.
- Anyways.

298
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:34,805
- All right. Well, wake up.
- Bye, boys.

299
00:17:34,979 --> 00:17:37,004
- She's still with that guy?
- Yeah.

300
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:40,150
- You kidding me? But he lives in Miami.
- Yeah.

301
00:17:40,318 --> 00:17:41,512
Wait- No- Yeah, hold on.

302
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:44,621
I don't think you understand
the gravity of this situation.

303
00:17:44,789 --> 00:17:47,053
I wanna put things of mine
inside things of hers.

304
00:17:47,224 --> 00:17:49,124
I know you do. I know.

305
00:17:52,129 --> 00:17:53,994
I heart you crazy mad

306
00:17:54,165 --> 00:17:55,462
Until it feels so good

307
00:17:55,633 --> 00:17:59,000
I'm about to do something drastic
'Cause I gotta have it

308
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:00,364
- What is this?
- Mm-hm.

309
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:04,497
I heart you crazy mad
I'm in a panic 'cause I

310
00:18:04,675 --> 00:18:06,142
I'm genuinely getting nauseous.

311
00:18:06,677 --> 00:18:08,770
I'm going out of my head

312
00:18:08,946 --> 00:18:11,073
Are they singing
"I heart you crazy mad"?

313
00:18:11,248 --> 00:18:13,808
Yeah, they are. Sadly, they are.

314
00:18:15,152 --> 00:18:17,245
Jesus. 3Z? Heh.

315
00:18:17,421 --> 00:18:18,615
Now comes the fun part...

316
00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:22,350
...because I get to look at your face
when I say I'm assigning them to you.

317
00:18:22,793 --> 00:18:24,226
- Ah, there it is.
- Ha-ha-ha.

318
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:26,795
I know. I know it sucks.
Believe me, I know, okay?

319
00:18:26,964 --> 00:18:30,229
The higher-ups wanna sign these guys.
They could be our Jonas Brothers.

320
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:32,596
Come on. Don't do this to me.

321
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:34,904
What about all the bands
that I bring you?

322
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:37,563
Demos you never listen to?
Give me a shot with those.

323
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:39,573
- That's not our focus right now.
- Will-

324
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:42,770
Hey. You know who I had to scout
when I was your age?

325
00:18:42,947 --> 00:18:46,883
Nelson and Jesus Jones. All right?

326
00:18:47,051 --> 00:18:48,951
You know one song. I know like 100.

327
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,588
You know what that does
to your emotionaI stability?

328
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:53,849
- You covered Jesus Jones?
- Yeah.

329
00:18:54,025 --> 00:18:55,856
How old are you?

330
00:18:57,595 --> 00:18:59,256
I don't wanna talk about that.

331
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:02,422
Do this. Show the idiots in charge
that you wanna get promoted...

332
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,591
...then you can make the call
on some bands.

333
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:07,966
I can't look at them without la-
I don't know how I'm gonna do this.

334
00:19:08,139 --> 00:19:10,937
You'll figure it out. Unh.

335
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,575
Close them.

336
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,470
So have they offered you a job yet?

337
00:19:17,648 --> 00:19:19,445
It's nice to talk to you too, Corinne.

338
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:20,811
Have you even asked them?

339
00:19:20,985 --> 00:19:23,681
Look, the whole newspaper business
is falling apart, okay?

340
00:19:23,854 --> 00:19:26,049
People here are struggling
to keep their jobs...

341
00:19:26,223 --> 00:19:27,986
...so I can't exactly ask for one.

342
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:29,820
Maya, statue.

343
00:19:30,394 --> 00:19:32,954
Look, all I'm saying,
and please know that I love you...

344
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:36,463
...is that you are behind in your life,
and we all know why.

345
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:41,003
Yeah, I'm currently up to speed on the fact
that my life is not currently up to speed.

346
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:43,534
Maya, statue.

347
00:19:45,109 --> 00:19:46,371
Ooh, Olive Garden.

348
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:52,172
- Jesus Chri- Phil!
The pantry shelves just collapsed.

349
00:19:52,683 --> 00:19:54,674
Erin?
- Shit.

350
00:19:54,852 --> 00:19:56,843
I need you to watch Maya for me, please.

351
00:19:57,021 --> 00:20:00,457
Erin. All the other interns are doing
research so you're on desk duty.

352
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:02,391
Okay.

353
00:20:03,561 --> 00:20:05,426
Hugh, wait.

354
00:20:05,596 --> 00:20:10,363
Look, I would really love
to turn this internship into a job.

355
00:20:10,534 --> 00:20:12,968
And it's fine that my last piece
didn't get picked...

356
00:20:13,137 --> 00:20:16,163
...and the ones that do
usually get bumped for space.

357
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,967
But it is my dream to work here...

358
00:20:18,142 --> 00:20:20,235
...and I would like
to make a good impression.

359
00:20:20,411 --> 00:20:22,743
Good. Then do that.

360
00:20:22,913 --> 00:20:24,380
Okay.

361
00:20:24,548 --> 00:20:27,483
Um, well, is there a piece
you could assign me, or...?

362
00:20:27,651 --> 00:20:28,709
A piece.

363
00:20:28,886 --> 00:20:32,549
Uh, the only thing I have is a human
interest story on Grant-A-Dream.

364
00:20:32,723 --> 00:20:35,191
- It's a charitable organization-
- Yes, Grant-A-Dream.

365
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:38,851
It grants wishes to terminally ill children.
I love terminally ill children.

366
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:41,725
Don't get too excited.
Four other people passed on this.

367
00:20:42,399 --> 00:20:43,696
- I'm on it.
- Okay, good.

368
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:46,962
Uh, write it up, put it on my desk.
Thank you.

369
00:20:52,943 --> 00:20:54,570
Corinne- Ugh.

370
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,708
Thanks a lot, Erin.
Where did you get these Oreo cookies?

371
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:02,114
Spit it out. Spit. More. More. More.

372
00:21:02,286 --> 00:21:04,584
All of it. All of it. Maya.

373
00:21:04,755 --> 00:21:05,915
All of it. All of it.

374
00:21:10,261 --> 00:21:12,195
There's that. Thank you so much.

375
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,794
- Hello?
- Hello.

376
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,970
I see you haven't entered me
into your phone yet.

377
00:21:22,139 --> 00:21:24,505
Oh, you know what happened?

378
00:21:24,675 --> 00:21:27,576
- What's that?
- I forgot your name.

379
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:28,769
Ah.

380
00:21:28,946 --> 00:21:31,471
That's too bad for me. Um-

381
00:21:31,649 --> 00:21:36,143
Well, I, Garrett, was wondering
if you'd allow me to take you to dinner.

382
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,788
Um, yeah. I could eat.

383
00:21:38,956 --> 00:21:40,981
Yeah? Great.

384
00:21:41,192 --> 00:21:44,093
- All right, text me the address.
- Okay.

385
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:53,430
What's your favorite food?

386
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:57,563
Every Friday night, my family, we'd go out
to this place, Luigi's, in my hometown.

387
00:21:57,741 --> 00:21:59,208
I'd get tortellini.

388
00:21:59,376 --> 00:22:03,278
I think I love it just because of that.
It reminds me of Friday nights growing up.

389
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,779
How would you like to die?

390
00:22:06,217 --> 00:22:08,651
- Eating too much tortellini.
- Ha-ha-ha.

391
00:22:08,819 --> 00:22:11,879
Or waterboarding.
I'd love to be waterboarded to death.

392
00:22:12,056 --> 00:22:15,890
Give me, like, three albums that you really
love, that meant something to you.

393
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,721
Licensed To lll, the Beastie Boys.

394
00:22:17,895 --> 00:22:19,829
Oh, the best.

395
00:22:19,997 --> 00:22:23,228
That was one because it was dangerous.
And I had no danger in my life.

396
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,391
I thought like-
My idea of danger was like...

397
00:22:25,569 --> 00:22:27,662
...getting chocolate milk
from the lunch lady.

398
00:22:27,838 --> 00:22:30,739
Okay, what's the meanest lie
you've ever told someone...

399
00:22:30,908 --> 00:22:33,900
- ... to get them out in the morning?
- I had to meet my wife for breakfast.

400
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:44,784
Ready?
There we go. Learn by doing.

401
00:22:44,955 --> 00:22:46,479
There it is.

402
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:49,626
- That way. Love that. Love that.
- Yay!

403
00:22:49,793 --> 00:22:51,727
Okay, run. Wrong way.
Go the other way.

404
00:22:51,896 --> 00:22:52,920
Fuck!

405
00:22:55,699 --> 00:22:58,600
No, no, no! No!

406
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:16,408
Ugh.

407
00:23:16,587 --> 00:23:19,055
I mean, is that gonna go on all day?
- I don't know. Probably.

408
00:23:19,223 --> 00:23:20,690
We're staring directly at you.

409
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:23,691
We're rowing
like a bunch of Viking slaves.

410
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:26,386
Come on, we're having fun here.
We're staring at you.

411
00:23:40,945 --> 00:23:43,004
Do you wanna have kids?

412
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,647
Why, you wanna take those kids?

413
00:23:44,815 --> 00:23:48,683
No, I mean, just like, you know,
later on in life, do you wanna have kids?

414
00:23:48,852 --> 00:23:50,444
Yeah, of course.

415
00:23:50,621 --> 00:23:51,815
Do you?

416
00:23:52,122 --> 00:23:53,248
I don't know.

417
00:23:53,424 --> 00:23:56,052
That's why I like coming
and looking at the old couples.

418
00:23:56,226 --> 00:24:00,629
Some of them seem genuinely, not only
happy, but sometimes I think, content.

419
00:24:00,831 --> 00:24:03,766
I think sometimes that's more important
than, like, happiness.

420
00:24:03,934 --> 00:24:07,028
Like the guy we saw in the plaid shirt
walking down- He's happy.

421
00:24:07,204 --> 00:24:10,401
The only way you're content in life
is if you marry your best friend.

422
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:13,099
- They make each other laugh-
- So I have to marry Dan?

423
00:24:13,277 --> 00:24:15,211
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Or Box? They gotta duke it out.

424
00:24:15,546 --> 00:24:16,740
I'm having fun.

425
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:18,381
Me too.

426
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:22,018
I'm only here for a couple more weeks.
Right.

427
00:24:22,219 --> 00:24:24,210
But maybe you'll come back one day.

428
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:30,021
Pushing that deadline another day.
- Sure.

429
00:24:32,963 --> 00:24:34,021
See you.

430
00:24:35,065 --> 00:24:38,193
- Um, excuse me, Hugh? Hi.
- Oh, hey.

431
00:24:38,369 --> 00:24:42,430
Um, I just wanted to say goodbye
because it's my last day-

432
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:43,664
Well, goodbye.

433
00:24:43,841 --> 00:24:47,743
I was curious, um, what did you think
of my Grant-A-Dream piece?

434
00:24:48,012 --> 00:24:50,003
Uh... Oh, it was good.
We're gonna run it.

435
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,738
- You are?
- Yeah.

436
00:24:51,915 --> 00:24:53,382
- Really?
- Yeah.

437
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:56,610
- Well, that's great.
- Yeah. Tuesday. Congratulations.

438
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:58,448
- Nice piece of writing.
- Thank you.

439
00:24:58,622 --> 00:24:59,646
Yeah. Good work.

440
00:24:59,823 --> 00:25:02,587
I want you to know
what an incredible experience I had here.

441
00:25:02,993 --> 00:25:04,551
Good.

442
00:25:06,263 --> 00:25:07,423
Okay.

443
00:25:07,598 --> 00:25:11,864
Do you think that there's
any possible chance in the future...

444
00:25:12,036 --> 00:25:13,526
...that it could lead to a job?

445
00:25:14,838 --> 00:25:17,932
Well, look, you know,
you're a good writer...

446
00:25:18,108 --> 00:25:20,167
...and anything's possible...

447
00:25:20,344 --> 00:25:22,778
...so why don't you call me
after the new year, okay?

448
00:25:22,946 --> 00:25:26,109
- And we'll see where things are at.
- I will call you in January.

449
00:25:26,283 --> 00:25:28,046
- Okay, good. Perfect.
- Like, the first.

450
00:25:28,218 --> 00:25:30,618
- All right. Great.
- At like 5 a. m.

451
00:25:30,788 --> 00:25:34,087
Great, that's good, Erin. Thank you.
Just remember the time difference.

452
00:25:34,258 --> 00:25:37,352
- Okay. Bye, Hugh. Thank you.
- Take care. Okay, bye, now.

453
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,661
Hey, you.

454
00:25:41,832 --> 00:25:44,630
Good afternoon, is Erin there, please?

455
00:25:44,802 --> 00:25:46,167
This is Erin.

456
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:49,328
Is it? Well, this is Garrett Austin Scully
telephoning.

457
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:52,475
I met you at that bar
by the Centipede machine.

458
00:25:52,643 --> 00:25:55,976
Yeah, I remember. Nice hair, decent face.

459
00:25:56,146 --> 00:25:57,636
Ah. That's the one.

460
00:25:57,815 --> 00:26:00,249
Listen, I know this is your
last night in New York...

461
00:26:00,417 --> 00:26:03,511
...so I was wondering if you would
allow me to take you out...

462
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:06,121
...for a nice farewell dinner.

463
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:08,155
I would love to.

464
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:17,626
All right, I don't wanna impress you all
at once but these are actuaI cloth napkins.

465
00:26:18,335 --> 00:26:20,667
- That's genuine cloth, that's polyester.
- Ooh. Ha, ha.

466
00:26:20,838 --> 00:26:24,740
Yeah, not to put on airs or anything,
and all-you-can-eat garlic balls.

467
00:26:24,908 --> 00:26:30,369
Ha-ha-ha. Wow. You have really
outdone yourself, Mr. Scully.

468
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:32,644
I will take that not sarcastically.

469
00:26:33,083 --> 00:26:34,107
Good evening.

470
00:26:34,284 --> 00:26:37,048
Um, can I get your drink order
to start with?

471
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:38,688
- Should we get some wine?
- Yeah.

472
00:26:38,856 --> 00:26:41,017
- Do you have a list?
- Uh, we don't.

473
00:26:41,191 --> 00:26:44,319
We just have the one,
the jug of wine?

474
00:26:44,495 --> 00:26:46,690
It's a Sunshine Harbor?

475
00:26:46,864 --> 00:26:49,731
It's the house wine.

476
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,765
And how is it?
How would you describe it?

477
00:26:51,935 --> 00:26:55,530
- Um, it's okay. You know.
- Well, there you go.

478
00:26:55,706 --> 00:26:57,867
- All right.
Well done. Well played.

479
00:26:58,041 --> 00:27:01,169
I think the lady and I will partake
of the Sunshine Harbor...

480
00:27:01,345 --> 00:27:03,006
...per your glowing recommendation.

481
00:27:03,213 --> 00:27:05,238
- Um, now, what year is this?
- Uh...

482
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:06,439
This.

483
00:27:07,618 --> 00:27:09,108
Nothing worse than an old wine.

484
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,119
That's how I feeI.

485
00:27:11,288 --> 00:27:13,586
- I'll be right back to get your order.
- Okay.

486
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,551
Um, ahem.

487
00:27:18,729 --> 00:27:22,688
I just wanna thank you
for calling me a lady.

488
00:27:22,866 --> 00:27:29,237
Well, because you are a beautifuI, funny,
intelligent woman...

489
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:32,072
...who I've had
an amazing time with.

490
00:27:32,242 --> 00:27:33,971
Yeah, I'm bummed it's our last night.

491
00:27:34,978 --> 00:27:36,036
Me too.

492
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:38,104
And I've-

493
00:27:38,348 --> 00:27:41,146
I don't think I've ever enjoyed
getting to know someone more.

494
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:44,049
It's been such a good six weeks.

495
00:27:44,421 --> 00:27:45,479
Went by so fast.

496
00:27:47,224 --> 00:27:49,158
I can't really articulate.

497
00:27:49,326 --> 00:27:50,759
Six weeks too fast.

498
00:27:51,195 --> 00:27:52,492
Me like you.

499
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:54,055
Wine.

500
00:28:01,071 --> 00:28:03,096
- Oh, my God.
- That's disgusting.

501
00:28:03,273 --> 00:28:05,798
You're lucky you didn't keep it in,
because I'm getting an ulcer.

502
00:28:58,462 --> 00:28:59,827
Well, I guess this is it.

503
00:28:59,997 --> 00:29:03,296
Yeah. Guess this is it.

504
00:29:13,911 --> 00:29:15,401
Take care of yourself.

505
00:29:16,446 --> 00:29:17,936
Okay.

506
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:20,706
- Okay, bye.
- I'll s-

507
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:25,247
- Uh- Oh, let me-
- I got it, I got it.

508
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:43,372
Whoa, whoa.
You can't leave your car there.

509
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,770
- No, I-
- You can't leave your car at the curb.

510
00:29:45,976 --> 00:29:49,104
- I need to talk to this girI quickly.
- Shit, you chasing a girI?

511
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:51,213
- Yeah.
- For reaI?

512
00:29:51,381 --> 00:29:53,508
- Yeah.
- She got a nice ass?

513
00:29:53,984 --> 00:29:55,076
Like the wind.

514
00:29:55,252 --> 00:29:57,584
- What the hell does that mean?
- I have no idea.

515
00:29:58,188 --> 00:30:00,383
Please. Two seconds.

516
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:02,622
- Go on, now.
- Thank you, thank you.

517
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:05,823
Thank you so much.
Thank you, thank you.

518
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:15,332
Langford. Hey!

519
00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:17,131
- What are you doing?
- That sucked.

520
00:30:17,307 --> 00:30:18,433
- I know.
- God.

521
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:19,734
- That was terrible.
- Terrible.

522
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:21,537
- I can't end it like this.
- Neither can I.

523
00:30:21,712 --> 00:30:23,270
And that car ride was a disaster.

524
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:25,415
Oh, that was awfuI. It was so awkward.

525
00:30:25,582 --> 00:30:26,606
So awkward.

526
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:28,080
- It's the worst.
- The worst.

527
00:30:28,251 --> 00:30:29,411
Yeah, sorry, go ahead.

528
00:30:29,586 --> 00:30:30,644
Thank you.
Good, good.

529
00:30:30,821 --> 00:30:34,086
I didn't know if you wanted to keep
doing this or how you felt.

530
00:30:34,257 --> 00:30:36,782
I just- I freaked out, okay?

531
00:30:37,561 --> 00:30:39,290
I've had such a good time with you...

532
00:30:39,463 --> 00:30:41,590
...and a part of me
doesn't want that to end...

533
00:30:41,765 --> 00:30:44,632
...but I have been down this road before
with a guy.

534
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:48,237
I dropped out of college and I followed him
across the country...

535
00:30:48,405 --> 00:30:51,135
...and I dropped everything for him.

536
00:30:51,775 --> 00:30:54,243
And that's why my timeline is all off,
you know?

537
00:30:54,411 --> 00:30:57,107
And now I finally got everything
back on track...

538
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,111
...you know, with my life and schooI...

539
00:30:59,282 --> 00:31:01,842
...and then you had to come along...

540
00:31:02,019 --> 00:31:04,647
- ... and fuck that all up.
- Ow.

541
00:31:04,955 --> 00:31:06,422
I'm sorry.

542
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:09,423
I'm not asking you to drop out of schooI
or even move here.

543
00:31:09,593 --> 00:31:14,292
I'm just asking to see you
because I don't wanna lose you.

544
00:31:15,866 --> 00:31:18,027
Fuck the miles. Fuck them.

545
00:31:18,201 --> 00:31:21,534
I'll be here and you'll be there
and we'll just be long-distance...

546
00:31:21,705 --> 00:31:25,072
...because quite frankly,
I'm crazy about you.

547
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:27,837
I'm crazy about you too.

548
00:31:39,289 --> 00:31:41,689
I'm so glad you picked me up.

549
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:43,450
Of course.

550
00:31:43,627 --> 00:31:45,652
Maya made you something.

551
00:31:47,597 --> 00:31:51,363
- She's here.
- Hi, everybody.

552
00:31:51,768 --> 00:31:54,669
- Hi. Hi, my beautifuI niece.
Hi.

553
00:31:54,838 --> 00:31:55,862
Hi.

554
00:31:56,373 --> 00:31:57,840
"The suspect, Mr. Jones...

555
00:31:58,008 --> 00:32:01,136
...was heavily intoxicated
when he fired the. 44 Magnum. "

556
00:32:01,311 --> 00:32:05,008
We need to know where this information
is coming from. Is this your own theory?

557
00:32:07,451 --> 00:32:09,578
Aw, come on, man.
Come on, dude.

558
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:10,844
Are you serious?

559
00:32:11,021 --> 00:32:12,181
- All right.
What are y-?

560
00:32:12,355 --> 00:32:13,822
- Hold on.
- "What are you doing?"

561
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:15,924
"Nothing. What are you doing?"

562
00:32:16,092 --> 00:32:18,583
"Nothing.
This funny thing happened at work. "

563
00:32:18,762 --> 00:32:20,525
"This funny thing happened at schooI."

564
00:32:26,269 --> 00:32:29,432
He sneezed and scared mommy panda.

565
00:32:29,606 --> 00:32:33,235
Oh, my God. Baby panda has a cold.

566
00:32:37,013 --> 00:32:39,777
I had a thing when I was a kid.
I was obsessed with, like-

567
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:45,320
I thought it was cooI to not have lips.
Like MichaeI J. Fox and Jason Bateman.

568
00:32:45,489 --> 00:32:47,150
Those guys, like, I idolized them.

569
00:32:47,357 --> 00:32:50,520
They didn't have, like, lips,
and I had, like, big weird lips.

570
00:33:05,075 --> 00:33:06,770
- Oh.
- Ha-ha-ha.

571
00:33:18,722 --> 00:33:21,418
Look at that. You're up.

572
00:33:23,093 --> 00:33:24,617
You kidding me?

573
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:27,596
What are you doing? Come on. Come-

574
00:33:27,764 --> 00:33:29,322
- What the fuck?
Oh!

575
00:33:29,499 --> 00:33:30,591
Fore!

576
00:33:30,767 --> 00:33:33,429
- Are you fucking kidding?
- Yeah, that was a joke.

577
00:33:37,607 --> 00:33:38,801
You're such an asshole.

578
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:41,102
I gotta program all my numbers
into this goddamn thing.

579
00:33:41,278 --> 00:33:43,678
Ha, ha. Come on, man,
my actions were justified.

580
00:33:43,847 --> 00:33:45,007
It was a pretty good hit.

581
00:33:45,181 --> 00:33:47,843
It was funny, I'll give
you that, but justified? Really?

582
00:33:48,018 --> 00:33:50,418
- Destroying my phone? Come on.
No, maybe not.

583
00:33:50,587 --> 00:33:52,646
No, probably not. Not at all.

584
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:55,290
No, but it's like her vagina
has you possessed.

585
00:33:55,692 --> 00:33:57,125
I like him. A lot.

586
00:33:57,294 --> 00:33:59,194
Okay, I know, I know,
but are you dating?

587
00:33:59,362 --> 00:34:02,593
- Are you in an exclusive relationship?
- I don't know.

588
00:34:02,766 --> 00:34:05,030
What do you mean?
Don't you think you should know?

589
00:34:05,201 --> 00:34:09,535
I mean, he could be out there dry humping
half of New York City right now.

590
00:34:09,706 --> 00:34:12,174
"Dry humping"? Oh, that's scandalous.
That worries me.

591
00:34:12,342 --> 00:34:14,333
PhiI and I dry hump. Okay?

592
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:16,502
And it is intense. And it's very erotic.

593
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,944
And it's the only way
that I can actually get off.

594
00:34:19,115 --> 00:34:21,140
Dry humping is no fucking joke.

595
00:34:21,318 --> 00:34:25,186
So I think that you need to be clear
about what this relationship is.

596
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:26,982
Now what is the story
with you guys?

597
00:34:27,157 --> 00:34:29,352
Are you doing it monogamous
or what's the deaI?

598
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:30,959
Yeah.

599
00:34:31,561 --> 00:34:33,028
I don't know. Uh...

600
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:34,561
- Maybe, yeah.
- "Maybe"?

601
00:34:34,998 --> 00:34:37,523
Wow, okay.
You know what "maybe" gets you?

602
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:41,193
It gets her sucking every dude's dick
out there at Stanford. It really does.

603
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:42,804
Then you go and visit her.

604
00:34:42,973 --> 00:34:45,601
You have to kiss that blow-job factory
she calls a mouth.

605
00:34:45,775 --> 00:34:48,141
Thank you for that visuaI. Thanks, paI.

606
00:34:48,311 --> 00:34:51,747
That was, like, way graphic.
That was, like, extremely graphic.

607
00:34:51,915 --> 00:34:55,180
He's thousands of miles away from here.
You don't know what he's doing.

608
00:34:55,352 --> 00:35:00,312
He could be at some bar,
doing shots with some sexy bartender...

609
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:01,548
...dry humping her.

610
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:03,716
We haven't set the boundaries yet.

611
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:05,019
- Okay?
- Oh, my God.

612
00:35:05,195 --> 00:35:07,629
We're not trying to choke each other
with commitment.

613
00:35:07,797 --> 00:35:09,355
But now you're freaking me out...

614
00:35:09,532 --> 00:35:13,263
...and I can't do anything but picture him
humping some bartender. Thank you.

615
00:35:13,436 --> 00:35:16,234
I'm your sister.
This is what I'm here to do: terrify you.

616
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:18,636
- I see PhiI dry humping you.
- You don't wanna.

617
00:35:18,808 --> 00:35:22,505
I don't wanna think about
what that looks like. It's not pretty.

618
00:35:22,712 --> 00:35:24,907
Like, between the snorting
and the slobbering...

619
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:26,639
...he's like a fucking shar-pei.

620
00:35:26,816 --> 00:35:28,078
Or what are those dogs with the:

621
00:35:29,552 --> 00:35:32,715
- Bulldogs?
- Yeah. Like a fucking bulldog.

622
00:35:32,889 --> 00:35:35,084
Does he look up at you
when he goes down on you?

623
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:37,419
- Wanting approvaI?
- Yes. Ha, ha.

624
00:35:37,594 --> 00:35:39,289
"Am I doing it okay? Am I doing it?"

625
00:35:39,462 --> 00:35:41,589
- I hate that. Shut up and lick.
- It's horrible.

626
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:43,164
I don't know, actually.

627
00:35:43,333 --> 00:35:45,858
Okay, look, look.
Can you see other people? All right?

628
00:35:46,036 --> 00:35:47,628
Can you hook up with other people?

629
00:35:47,804 --> 00:35:50,102
- Can you masturbate?
- Masturbate?

630
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,104
Can you masturbate yourself off at all?

631
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:54,539
- Why wouldn't I?
- Some girls frown upon that.

632
00:35:54,711 --> 00:35:57,942
- Some girls don't like you to masturbate.
- She's not like a puritan.

633
00:35:58,114 --> 00:36:02,642
Well, I'm just saying, like, some women
don't like people masturbating.

634
00:36:02,819 --> 00:36:04,878
Because I can hear you
through the walls.

635
00:36:05,055 --> 00:36:06,147
And you crack off a lot.

636
00:36:06,322 --> 00:36:07,619
"Crack it off"?

637
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:08,815
Who says "crack off"?

638
00:36:08,992 --> 00:36:10,186
Why? What do you say?

639
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,294
You may be thinking
of "snap one off"?

640
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:15,124
- "Snap it off"?
- Or "pop"? Like, "pop one off"?

641
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:18,096
I don't want anything to snap and pop
when I'm masturbating.

642
00:36:18,268 --> 00:36:20,168
- If it cracks a little bit, fine.
- "Fine"?

643
00:36:20,336 --> 00:36:23,828
The point is, you're gonna chafe yourself
cracking off as much as you do.

644
00:36:24,007 --> 00:36:26,532
All right, so, we-
Do you need help across the street?

645
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:28,007
Okay. Don't pull, though.

646
00:36:28,178 --> 00:36:31,511
He goes crazy.
He's furious with his penis or something.

647
00:36:31,681 --> 00:36:32,739
Angry.

648
00:36:32,916 --> 00:36:34,747
Angry masturbation,
which is dangerous.

649
00:36:34,918 --> 00:36:36,681
- You can really injure yourself.
- Yeah.

650
00:36:36,853 --> 00:36:38,445
So he doesn't really know that.

651
00:36:38,621 --> 00:36:41,112
Yeah. I have to tell my grandson that.

652
00:36:41,291 --> 00:36:43,987
Tell your grandson.
Tell your grandson's friends, you know?

653
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,491
Well, just him. Not others.

654
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:49,462
You're right. Just him.
It might get awkward telling all his friends.

655
00:36:51,201 --> 00:36:53,499
I guess you have to define it
at some point.

656
00:36:53,903 --> 00:36:57,464
So I guess we're saying...

657
00:36:58,408 --> 00:37:00,433
...we're exclusive?

658
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:03,306
- Yeah.
- Great.

659
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,970
- I'm happy.
- Me too.

660
00:37:05,148 --> 00:37:08,675
Secretly, this is what I was aiming for.

661
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:11,184
Well, not-so-secretly, me too.

662
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:12,378
Keep it light.

663
00:37:12,555 --> 00:37:14,648
Light. Disease-free and light.

664
00:37:14,824 --> 00:37:16,883
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Bye.

665
00:37:17,594 --> 00:37:18,686
Goodbye.

666
00:37:21,765 --> 00:37:26,361
Can I please get the garbage omelet,
double meat, home fries...

667
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:28,367
...and how about everything bageI...

668
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:31,507
...with butter, cream cheese,
jelly, all that shit.

669
00:37:31,674 --> 00:37:34,108
And then, you know what?
I'll take a chocolate shake.

670
00:37:34,277 --> 00:37:36,006
And I will make it very easy for you.

671
00:37:36,179 --> 00:37:38,670
- You know, I'll have that same exact thing.
- Okay.

672
00:37:38,848 --> 00:37:40,782
- I'll just have the turkey burger.
Okay.

673
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:45,853
Is there a way to just wrap it in lettuce,
like use lettuce for the bun?

674
00:37:46,022 --> 00:37:47,990
Can do no bun. Does that work?
- No bun.

675
00:37:48,158 --> 00:37:49,318
Fries or salad?

676
00:37:49,492 --> 00:37:53,019
Uh, I'll get the salad
with dressing on the side.

677
00:37:53,196 --> 00:37:55,255
Yep, coming up.
- Thank you.

678
00:37:56,466 --> 00:37:57,831
- Wow.
- What?

679
00:37:58,001 --> 00:38:00,492
- You're eating like a bird there, huh?
- No.

680
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:04,071
He's visiting Erin for Thanksgiving
and worrying about his weight.

681
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,264
- All right.
- Jesus.

682
00:38:05,441 --> 00:38:07,238
I told you not to say anything.

683
00:38:08,011 --> 00:38:10,104
We haven't seen each other
in a while, okay?

684
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,248
Okay, I understand.
That makes sense to me.

685
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:14,406
- Wanna tighten up.
- I get you, I get you.

686
00:38:14,584 --> 00:38:18,213
If you're so worried about your appearance,
are you gonna do something...

687
00:38:18,388 --> 00:38:19,855
- ... about your veiny, white skin?
Mm.

688
00:38:20,023 --> 00:38:22,423
Right now you look like an actor
in a kabuki troupe.

689
00:38:22,592 --> 00:38:24,719
- You're one to talk about appearances.
- How so?

690
00:38:24,894 --> 00:38:27,089
No offense, but with the moustache...

691
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:29,629
- What? You don't like it?
- It's disgusting.

692
00:38:29,799 --> 00:38:32,063
I don't care what you think.
This is not for you.

693
00:38:32,235 --> 00:38:33,759
Who's it for, the '83 Yankees bullpen?

694
00:38:35,138 --> 00:38:36,469
- Now, there we are.
- Very funny.

695
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:40,632
No, I'm actually trying to scratch a very
specific demographic off of my fuck-it list.

696
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:43,802
- What's a fuck-it list?
- He's got this list like a bucket list...

697
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:46,574
...but it's women he's trying to bang
before he dies.

698
00:38:46,749 --> 00:38:49,217
So, what kind of women
are you hoping to attract?

699
00:38:49,385 --> 00:38:51,979
- Older women, between 45 and 60.
- Oh, so, cougars.

700
00:38:52,155 --> 00:38:54,453
- This is where it's weird.
- No. No, not cougars.

701
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:57,457
Okay, see, cougars, to me,
are sad, desperate older women...

702
00:38:57,627 --> 00:38:59,151
...that want to be young now.

703
00:38:59,329 --> 00:39:02,787
Okay? But what I'm looking for are older
attractive women...

704
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:05,457
...that want to be young again.
All right?

705
00:39:05,635 --> 00:39:08,798
See, when women see me
with a moustache of that type...

706
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:11,532
...they're transported back
when the moustache was king:

707
00:39:11,708 --> 00:39:13,232
- The '70s, the early '80s.
- Right.

708
00:39:13,409 --> 00:39:15,604
All right?
The era of their sexuaI awakening.

709
00:39:15,778 --> 00:39:18,770
So then, when I'm on top of them,
and they look up at me...

710
00:39:18,948 --> 00:39:21,644
...they see this person,
they're transported to that time.

711
00:39:21,818 --> 00:39:24,685
All right? See, this isn't a moustache,
it's a time machine.

712
00:39:24,854 --> 00:39:27,482
It's a time machine
to the back of Burt Reynolds' Camaro.

713
00:39:27,891 --> 00:39:29,256
Right. You know what, it's-

714
00:39:29,425 --> 00:39:31,620
Bottom line is don't get a moustache,
get a tan.

715
00:39:31,794 --> 00:39:35,286
I don't think she's that kind of girI.
I don't think she's that superficiaI.

716
00:39:35,465 --> 00:39:37,831
Okay, so she won't bang fat dudes...

717
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:41,562
...but she will sleep with a guy
that looks like his face is covered in jizz?

718
00:39:41,738 --> 00:39:43,706
If she's gonna
dump you for eating carbs...

719
00:39:43,873 --> 00:39:46,933
- ... she'll dump you for not having a tan.
- That's true.

720
00:39:47,744 --> 00:39:49,006
All right, I get the point.

721
00:39:51,214 --> 00:39:53,910
Once you're in the machine,
it's pretty self-explanatory.

722
00:39:54,083 --> 00:39:56,950
You're gonna wanna put this on
your hands, under your nails...

723
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,883
...unless you want your hands stained.

724
00:39:59,055 --> 00:40:01,182
- Right this way.
- Okay.

725
00:40:01,824 --> 00:40:04,122
- Enjoy the Faux de SoleiI.
- Just a quick question. Uh-

726
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:38,822
- Ooh.
Hello. Tanning will begin in five...

727
00:40:39,128 --> 00:40:41,722
- Uh-
- ... four, three...

728
00:40:41,898 --> 00:40:43,957
- Should I be wearing underwear?
- ... two, one.

729
00:40:44,133 --> 00:40:47,261
Excuse me. Oh, God. Oh, goddamn it.

730
00:40:47,437 --> 00:40:48,597
Oh, and it stings.

731
00:40:48,771 --> 00:40:50,102
Fuck. Fuck, my eyes sting.

732
00:40:50,273 --> 00:40:51,763
What is this? Excuse me.

733
00:40:51,941 --> 00:40:53,704
Should I be wearing goggles?

734
00:40:53,876 --> 00:40:55,844
It stings. Is this bad?

735
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:59,404
Ah. Tastes gross. Pff, pff.

736
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:01,675
Tastes like poison. Pff, pff.

737
00:41:01,851 --> 00:41:04,183
Should I-? Is it bad if I eat it?

738
00:41:11,627 --> 00:41:13,686
Erin, you just got sat another table.

739
00:41:13,863 --> 00:41:16,525
No way. I closed out my section.
You know it, dude.

740
00:41:16,699 --> 00:41:20,032
Well, you were requested. So...

741
00:41:20,403 --> 00:41:21,427
Sorry, Mama.

742
00:41:24,674 --> 00:41:27,370
Goddamn it.

743
00:41:29,812 --> 00:41:32,303
I'm not gonna order anything,
I want you to know.

744
00:41:32,482 --> 00:41:33,744
But I got a tip for you.

745
00:41:34,917 --> 00:41:36,782
Is it the tip of your penis?

746
00:41:37,653 --> 00:41:41,282
- No, gross. Yes, it is.
- Aah!

747
00:41:41,758 --> 00:41:42,816
Oh, my God.

748
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:48,294
- Twenty percent of my dick.
- Ha-ha-ha!

749
00:41:59,142 --> 00:42:00,939
Oh, God, yes. Come on.

750
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:03,635
Where's the bedroom?
- Too far.

751
00:42:03,813 --> 00:42:05,542
Come over here.

752
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:09,181
Oh, God. Oh, I missed you.

753
00:42:09,719 --> 00:42:11,277
Come here. God!

754
00:42:11,454 --> 00:42:13,388
Oh, God. Oh, God!

755
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,320
Oh!

756
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,758
PhiI!

757
00:42:26,402 --> 00:42:28,597
They came in so fast,
I didn't know where to go.

758
00:42:29,705 --> 00:42:31,332
Hi. I'm PhiI.

759
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:32,872
Hey. I'm Garrett.

760
00:42:33,042 --> 00:42:34,703
- Nice to meet you.
Good to meet you.

761
00:42:34,877 --> 00:42:37,539
- Why are you introducing yourself?
- I don't wanna be rude.

762
00:42:37,713 --> 00:42:39,180
Get up. Fucking get up.

763
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:40,645
Is she still here?

764
00:42:40,817 --> 00:42:43,377
- You got a handprint on your ass.
I'll tell you later.

765
00:42:43,553 --> 00:42:46,078
- Don't engage.
- I'm eating at a dinner table.

766
00:42:46,255 --> 00:42:49,782
- They're the ones fucking.
- Get fucking fuck upstairs.

767
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:52,520
You guys are all set up, so I'll just-

768
00:42:52,995 --> 00:42:55,589
- Um...
Make yourself at home.

769
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,074
Aw...

770
00:43:12,248 --> 00:43:16,378
Mm. Corinne,
these mashed potatoes are amazing.

771
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:18,747
Thank you.
I spent all day cleaning the table.

772
00:43:19,222 --> 00:43:20,689
Sorry?
Making them.

773
00:43:20,857 --> 00:43:23,325
I spent-
It's an old recipe from the family.

774
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:26,522
Ahem. Well, very good.

775
00:43:27,763 --> 00:43:30,095
- Um, Garrett.
Yes, Karen.

776
00:43:30,266 --> 00:43:33,258
Now, are you a singer or a musician?

777
00:43:33,436 --> 00:43:35,700
No. Neither one. Excuse me.

778
00:43:35,872 --> 00:43:38,170
Yeah, I'm just behind-the-scenes guy.

779
00:43:38,441 --> 00:43:43,606
He actually goes out and scouts
bands, and then he signs them to his labeI...

780
00:43:44,714 --> 00:43:47,274
...and he takes us
to, like, these amazing places.

781
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:50,578
These seedy hole-in-the-walls
that you'd never know existed.

782
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:52,687
- That sounds cooI.
It's not that cooI.

783
00:43:52,855 --> 00:43:54,755
- She's building it up.
It is cooI.

784
00:43:54,924 --> 00:43:56,152
She's being sweet.

785
00:43:56,325 --> 00:43:58,953
Believe me, it's a lot more interesting
than what Ron does.

786
00:43:59,128 --> 00:44:01,392
Oh.
- He makes boxes for a living.

787
00:44:01,564 --> 00:44:05,056
Cardboard containers, Karen. Please.
They're cardboard- I'm a supervisor.

788
00:44:05,234 --> 00:44:08,260
- Pretty much boxes. Pretty much boxes.
- They're cardboard containers.

789
00:44:08,571 --> 00:44:11,870
Oh. I often use boxes.

790
00:44:13,476 --> 00:44:16,570
The thing about my job
is that it's in a state of flux.

791
00:44:16,746 --> 00:44:19,146
In fact, both of our fields
are kind of a little-

792
00:44:19,315 --> 00:44:21,442
- We're in very similar positions.
- Yeah.

793
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:23,482
But we do it because we love it.

794
00:44:23,653 --> 00:44:25,120
We do it because we love it.

795
00:44:25,288 --> 00:44:28,382
So, Erin, did you know
he was coming in?

796
00:44:28,558 --> 00:44:30,423
No. He completely surprised me.

797
00:44:30,593 --> 00:44:31,617
Surprised me too.

798
00:44:33,129 --> 00:44:35,791
- No one knew.
And it was quite a surprise.

799
00:44:35,965 --> 00:44:39,560
But he surprised me at work
with flowers.

800
00:44:40,937 --> 00:44:43,497
- Oh.
- Jesus Christ.

801
00:44:43,673 --> 00:44:45,766
It wasn't a big deaI.

802
00:44:45,942 --> 00:44:48,934
I didn't, like, rappeI in from
some helicopter. I just showed up.

803
00:44:49,111 --> 00:44:51,170
How come you never do that?
Ha, ha.

804
00:44:51,347 --> 00:44:52,837
Because we live together, Karen.

805
00:44:53,015 --> 00:44:55,779
I know, but it's nice
to show a gesture of appreciation.

806
00:44:55,952 --> 00:44:58,182
How long have you guys been together?

807
00:44:58,354 --> 00:45:00,822
- It's been a long time now. Yeah.
- Long time.

808
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:04,323
It's kind of like when you get really drunk
and you just black out...

809
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:07,189
...you don't know how much time's
gone by. Sort of a similar feeling.

810
00:45:09,532 --> 00:45:10,760
Oh.

811
00:45:10,933 --> 00:45:14,699
Erin, Karen, would you come help me
in the kitchen with dessert?

812
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:18,567
Absolutely. Corinne's gonna go assassinate
your character. I gotta play defense.

813
00:45:18,741 --> 00:45:21,574
- Oh. Hurry. Hurry up.
Yeah.

814
00:45:22,545 --> 00:45:24,240
Um...

815
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:29,549
So, Ron, do you make all different sizes
of boxes, or do you specialize in a certain-?

816
00:45:29,719 --> 00:45:33,450
Do you have any idea of the trouble
that you're causing us there, chief?

817
00:45:35,658 --> 00:45:37,819
Ron, please,
tell me what's bothering you.

818
00:45:37,994 --> 00:45:40,189
I'll tell you what's bothering me there,
bucko.

819
00:45:40,363 --> 00:45:43,230
You just caused a prime-time problem
between me and my wife.

820
00:45:43,399 --> 00:45:46,835
Now I gotta go home and listen to her
complain that I don't do enough for her.

821
00:45:47,003 --> 00:45:50,962
Ha, ha. You think some effing sappy shit
makes you a reaI boyfriend?

822
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:52,903
I stopped listening after "bucko. "

823
00:45:53,075 --> 00:45:56,841
Listen up. We're in the effing trenches here,
where the reaI hell happens.

824
00:45:57,013 --> 00:45:58,947
All right? And we're here every day.

825
00:45:59,115 --> 00:46:02,175
It's not about flowers and presents
and showing up for the weekend.

826
00:46:02,351 --> 00:46:07,084
Do you think you can just come in here
with your fake tan and your girI shirt?

827
00:46:07,256 --> 00:46:08,280
What?

828
00:46:08,457 --> 00:46:10,857
You think that's what it's like
when you're married?

829
00:46:11,027 --> 00:46:15,293
When you're in a serious,
long-term relationship?

830
00:46:15,498 --> 00:46:19,161
You think you're gonna be able to work out
and keep that nice ass of yours?

831
00:46:19,468 --> 00:46:21,333
No. You're not gonna be able to keep it.

832
00:46:25,775 --> 00:46:28,676
And I don't wanna say

833
00:46:30,179 --> 00:46:32,545
If it goes away

834
00:46:33,115 --> 00:46:34,139
Hey.

835
00:46:34,317 --> 00:46:36,217
- Hey, how are you?
I'm good. How are you?

836
00:46:36,385 --> 00:46:38,649
Hey, do you remember my friend Harper
from work?

837
00:46:38,854 --> 00:46:41,550
Yeah, we've met. How are you?
It's good to see you again.

838
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:58,001
What the rest did
I was average

839
00:46:58,174 --> 00:47:00,802
But I don't mind

840
00:47:02,044 --> 00:47:05,480
Drawn on two sides
Without disguise

841
00:47:05,648 --> 00:47:08,378
But I don't mind

842
00:47:08,551 --> 00:47:11,315
And I, I spit fire

843
00:47:11,487 --> 00:47:13,352
- Hey.
- Hey.

844
00:47:14,156 --> 00:47:16,215
- I love them. Yeah.
- Yeah? They're so good.

845
00:47:16,392 --> 00:47:19,088
You don't believe me

846
00:47:19,261 --> 00:47:22,253
They spent three years and all their money
getting this produced.

847
00:47:22,431 --> 00:47:23,489
Really?

848
00:47:23,666 --> 00:47:25,657
These are the bands
that should get noticed.

849
00:47:25,835 --> 00:47:30,534
I hate that. I hate that a band like this
would get passed over because of money.

850
00:47:30,773 --> 00:47:33,571
It's just take a chance on someone
because they deserve it...

851
00:47:33,743 --> 00:47:35,574
...because they're genuinely talented.

852
00:47:36,145 --> 00:47:37,339
Sorry. I'm sorry.

853
00:47:37,513 --> 00:47:41,040
It's just frustrating because I know
at my labeI they'd never go for this.

854
00:47:41,217 --> 00:47:43,412
It would be like a waste of time
to bring it up.

855
00:47:43,586 --> 00:47:46,783
Well, if you act all melodramatic
like that, yeah, it would be.

856
00:47:46,956 --> 00:47:50,414
But if you showed your balls and you
went in there and got in their face...

857
00:47:50,593 --> 00:47:53,562
...and said "listen to this,"
the worst they could do is say no.

858
00:47:53,729 --> 00:47:55,959
Or get mad at you
because you showed your balls.

859
00:47:56,132 --> 00:47:58,828
There you are.
Damon.

860
00:47:59,502 --> 00:48:00,935
Hi. How are you?

861
00:48:01,103 --> 00:48:03,071
- I'm all right. How are you?
- I'm great.

862
00:48:03,239 --> 00:48:04,501
What's going on?

863
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:05,833
- Hey. Garrett.
- I'm Damon.

864
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:07,669
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

865
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:11,006
- We all work together. He is the bartender.
- Oh, wow.

866
00:48:11,547 --> 00:48:12,571
- Cheers.
Cheers.

867
00:48:12,748 --> 00:48:16,445
Where have you been, Damon?
- Um, I was just helping my mom move.

868
00:48:16,619 --> 00:48:17,608
Aw...

869
00:48:17,787 --> 00:48:19,345
No, she's just getting old...

870
00:48:19,522 --> 00:48:22,355
...and I want her to live closer to me,
you know?

871
00:48:22,525 --> 00:48:23,549
Aw...

872
00:48:23,726 --> 00:48:24,715
Gush.

873
00:48:24,894 --> 00:48:28,125
It's funny, because I actually want my
mother to move further away from me.

874
00:48:30,433 --> 00:48:32,663
- Damon is close with his mom.
Good, good, good.

875
00:48:32,835 --> 00:48:35,861
- Well, you know, it's my mom, you know?
So cute.

876
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:37,767
- "And then my mom. "
- My mom.

877
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:40,431
Mothers are important.
Yeah, they are.

878
00:48:40,609 --> 00:48:42,873
You wouldn't be here
if it weren't for her vagina.

879
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:44,410
Found it easy

880
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:50,951
Easy

881
00:48:57,893 --> 00:49:00,020
Ooh. Shh.

882
00:49:00,196 --> 00:49:01,686
What?
Sorry. Sorry.

883
00:49:01,864 --> 00:49:05,322
Maya. Oh.
Okay.

884
00:49:05,768 --> 00:49:06,894
Hells yeah.

885
00:49:07,837 --> 00:49:09,805
- Icing and vodka.
- Mm.

886
00:49:09,972 --> 00:49:13,100
- That's a great chaser. Mm.
- Mm. Taste it.

887
00:49:16,011 --> 00:49:18,536
So Damon seems like a good guy.

888
00:49:18,714 --> 00:49:20,511
Oh, my God. He's amazing.

889
00:49:20,683 --> 00:49:23,618
- Like my rock.
- Your rock?

890
00:49:23,786 --> 00:49:25,879
Yeah, I wouldn't get through work
without him.

891
00:49:26,055 --> 00:49:29,081
Wow. And he's handsome,
and he loves his mother, and-

892
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:33,795
- Are you jealous?
- Aw, come on. Come on.

893
00:49:34,296 --> 00:49:35,991
No. Mm-mm.

894
00:49:36,165 --> 00:49:37,291
Yes, you are.

895
00:49:37,666 --> 00:49:41,602
I'm just a little curious if you guys
have ever, you know...

896
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:43,738
You know. Sorry.

897
00:49:46,008 --> 00:49:48,636
No. No. Not at all.

898
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:51,208
Oh, my God.

899
00:49:51,914 --> 00:49:54,075
You always gotta close your eyes.

900
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,585
- Hey, Corinne.
Hey.

901
00:50:06,762 --> 00:50:09,162
I'm taking off.

902
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:13,495
Um, can I help you? I don't know
what happened. It was something-

903
00:50:13,669 --> 00:50:14,966
- No! No! No.
- Oh, God.

904
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:17,264
- Sorry. No. No thank you. I'm good.
- Okay.

905
00:50:17,439 --> 00:50:18,838
- I'm good.
- I'm so sorry.

906
00:50:20,442 --> 00:50:25,243
Our introduction was not how I imagined
it would be, obviously...

907
00:50:27,683 --> 00:50:28,775
...but that was my hand.

908
00:50:30,219 --> 00:50:34,747
The handprint on my, uh, buttocks...

909
00:50:36,458 --> 00:50:38,824
...and my genitalia.

910
00:50:39,895 --> 00:50:41,886
You have a handprint on your crotch too?

911
00:50:44,133 --> 00:50:46,101
- You ready?
Yes. Great.

912
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:50,665
- Okay. Well, see you later, Corinne.
- I'll be back soon.

913
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:52,898
Okay, bye.
Okay, bye.

914
00:50:53,075 --> 00:50:54,372
Have a safe-
What?

915
00:50:54,543 --> 00:50:57,205
Have a safe flight, Garrett.
Thank you. You too-

916
00:50:57,379 --> 00:50:59,244
Or not- You're not flying. Okay.

917
00:51:05,054 --> 00:51:08,114
Oh, yes. Middle seat. Awesome.

918
00:51:08,290 --> 00:51:10,884
And a layover. Be fun.

919
00:51:11,227 --> 00:51:13,627
Thank you for making this trip.

920
00:51:13,796 --> 00:51:15,559
Thank you. That was the best.

921
00:51:15,731 --> 00:51:16,823
I had fun.

922
00:51:16,999 --> 00:51:19,991
I had fun too. Despite everything.

923
00:51:20,636 --> 00:51:22,934
Please, please apologize
to her again for me.

924
00:51:23,105 --> 00:51:24,436
- I will.
- Okay.

925
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:27,541
- God, she hates me. She does.
- Yeah.

926
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:33,509
I love you.

927
00:51:34,583 --> 00:51:36,517
I love you too.

928
00:51:47,830 --> 00:51:49,695
I miss you already.

929
00:52:07,216 --> 00:52:09,707
Cruella de ViI
was not based on an actuaI person.

930
00:52:09,885 --> 00:52:12,376
I'm pretty sure she was.
A German lady.

931
00:52:12,621 --> 00:52:14,612
I think you're wrong about that.
Hey, Dan.

932
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:16,155
Welcome home, buddy boy.

933
00:52:16,325 --> 00:52:18,623
Dude, what the fuck is this?

934
00:52:18,794 --> 00:52:21,957
- We got an open-door policy. It's cooI.
- Why? Why do you have that?

935
00:52:22,131 --> 00:52:24,793
Well, we don't. He does.
I just kind of accept it.

936
00:52:24,967 --> 00:52:26,958
- How was the trip, bro?
It was awesome.

937
00:52:27,403 --> 00:52:29,132
- Do we have beers?
We do have beers.

938
00:52:29,305 --> 00:52:30,636
- Will you grab me one?
Great.

939
00:52:30,806 --> 00:52:32,467
Don't drink a beer on the toilet.

940
00:52:32,641 --> 00:52:34,165
I was worried you'd get dumped...

941
00:52:34,343 --> 00:52:36,834
...and we'd have to go to the bar.
It went well, huh?

942
00:52:37,012 --> 00:52:38,445
No. It was really good.

943
00:52:38,614 --> 00:52:40,241
All the way.
That's all I'm doing.

944
00:52:40,416 --> 00:52:42,475
- Not far enough.
That's as far as I'm going.

945
00:52:42,651 --> 00:52:44,482
- I can't reach.
- That's as far as I go.

946
00:52:44,653 --> 00:52:47,121
I am not gonna hand you a beer
while you're shitting.

947
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:49,280
- I don't wanna get up.
- Get it afterwards.

948
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:52,484
I'm pooping as we speak.
I don't wanna have to get up to get a-

949
00:52:52,661 --> 00:52:54,185
Take it. There. Take it.

950
00:52:54,363 --> 00:52:55,955
Thank you!
Enjoy it. All right?

951
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:58,656
- I'm gonna go.
- It's fine. It's closed now.

952
00:52:59,935 --> 00:53:01,425
Did you tell her you loved her?

953
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:05,266
- I might have.
- Did you really?

954
00:53:05,441 --> 00:53:06,965
Yeah. I did.

955
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:08,939
Are you serious?

956
00:53:09,111 --> 00:53:10,100
Wow.

957
00:53:10,279 --> 00:53:12,076
- You gotta be carefuI.
- No.

958
00:53:12,247 --> 00:53:15,011
- You gotta be carefuI.
- Don't tell him he has to be carefuI.

959
00:53:15,184 --> 00:53:17,982
How long have you been together?
- Four months.

960
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:19,415
That's a very long time.

961
00:53:19,588 --> 00:53:20,612
Stop.
Will you-?

962
00:53:20,789 --> 00:53:24,316
Okay. Four months, all right? So now,
in this four months, how much time...

963
00:53:24,493 --> 00:53:28,020
...do you think you've spent together,
like in the same city? Physically.

964
00:53:28,197 --> 00:53:30,131
- Uh, I don't know.
- Forty days?

965
00:53:30,799 --> 00:53:32,357
- Yeah. Forty days.
- Tops. Yeah?

966
00:53:32,534 --> 00:53:34,024
Sure, that sounds about right.

967
00:53:34,203 --> 00:53:37,900
Now look, I have done the long-distance
thing, and it is hard as hell.

968
00:53:38,073 --> 00:53:40,507
And it doesn't matter how good
the relationship is.

969
00:53:40,676 --> 00:53:43,144
It literally can just rip it apart.

970
00:53:43,479 --> 00:53:47,506
Look, it is just very hard to be away from
the person you love for months at a time.

971
00:53:47,683 --> 00:53:50,049
I know. I know it's not gonna be easy.

972
00:53:50,219 --> 00:53:51,311
That's all I'm saying.

973
00:53:54,289 --> 00:53:56,314
But maybe you never found
the right girI.

974
00:53:57,659 --> 00:53:59,456
That's not a bad point.

975
00:54:00,396 --> 00:54:02,990
- Jesus Christ.
- What are you doing?

976
00:54:03,165 --> 00:54:06,191
You know what?
I want some privacy now. Pardon me.

977
00:54:06,802 --> 00:54:08,133
It's Erin, leave a message.

978
00:54:10,272 --> 00:54:13,002
Well, now I miss you even more.

979
00:54:13,175 --> 00:54:14,767
Thanks a lot.

980
00:54:18,747 --> 00:54:22,808
I'm going to bed,
so call me in the morning.

981
00:54:23,552 --> 00:54:25,543
Okay, good night.

982
00:55:11,066 --> 00:55:13,626
It's barely gonna fit.
The other ones wouldn't have fit.

983
00:55:13,802 --> 00:55:15,793
But you saw the top off
the bigger one and-

984
00:55:15,971 --> 00:55:18,371
What's the point?
Why not get one that's gonna fit?

985
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:21,441
This one looks little.
People are gonna think we're gay.

986
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:23,771
Okay, let's open our presents
at the same time.

987
00:55:23,946 --> 00:55:27,006
It's exciting and sad,
since it's the only present I got this year.

988
00:55:27,182 --> 00:55:28,206
Okay.

989
00:55:28,383 --> 00:55:30,783
You did a good wrapping job too.
I hope it's a pony.

990
00:55:32,154 --> 00:55:35,214
Oh... Centipede.

991
00:55:35,390 --> 00:55:36,414
I love it!

992
00:55:39,761 --> 00:55:41,319
That's so awesome.

993
00:55:41,497 --> 00:55:43,465
I love my present.

994
00:55:43,632 --> 00:55:44,894
I love you.

995
00:55:52,708 --> 00:55:54,539
Hyah!

996
00:55:56,845 --> 00:55:58,813
Hyah!

997
00:56:01,783 --> 00:56:03,045
Hey, Corinne.

998
00:56:03,218 --> 00:56:06,346
Can you ask Maya to keep it down
for just a second?

999
00:56:06,522 --> 00:56:08,422
Maya, statue.

1000
00:56:22,938 --> 00:56:24,132
Hello.

1001
00:56:24,306 --> 00:56:26,672
Hi, um, Hugh Edwards, please.

1002
00:56:27,042 --> 00:56:30,637
- This is he.
- Uh, hi. Uh, this is Erin Langford.

1003
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:34,613
- No.
- I was a summer intern for you.

1004
00:56:34,917 --> 00:56:36,009
No.

1005
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:41,520
I wrote that piece that you liked
so much on Grant-A-Dream.

1006
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:44,318
- Oh, yeah. How are you?
- I'm good.

1007
00:56:44,493 --> 00:56:45,858
Um...

1008
00:56:46,028 --> 00:56:49,327
You told me
that I should call you in January...

1009
00:56:49,498 --> 00:56:53,229
...about a possible permanent position,
so...

1010
00:56:53,402 --> 00:56:55,199
...here I am, calling you.

1011
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:56,394
Oh, right.

1012
00:56:57,406 --> 00:57:02,469
Well, look, honestly, we just got done
laying off 100 people...

1013
00:57:02,644 --> 00:57:05,738
...so we're not gonna be hiring
any time soon.

1014
00:57:06,281 --> 00:57:07,680
Sorry.

1015
00:57:08,917 --> 00:57:12,011
Why don't you try blogging? You know?
Heh.

1016
00:57:12,821 --> 00:57:15,289
Look, uh, best of luck to you.

1017
00:57:15,757 --> 00:57:17,884
- Okay.
- Take care.

1018
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:19,049
Thank you.

1019
00:57:24,499 --> 00:57:26,763
Fuck! Fuck.

1020
00:57:26,935 --> 00:57:28,869
I wanted that job, okay?

1021
00:57:29,037 --> 00:57:30,834
I wanted to be in New York.

1022
00:57:31,006 --> 00:57:34,203
Look at it this way, it's not like
someone else got the job over you.

1023
00:57:34,376 --> 00:57:35,934
They're just not taking anyone.

1024
00:57:36,111 --> 00:57:39,274
Yeah, I get it.
It's a bad time for newspapers, okay?

1025
00:57:39,448 --> 00:57:43,544
It's not just about the fucking job.
I wanted to be in the same city as you.

1026
00:57:44,086 --> 00:57:46,179
I know. Believe me, I know.

1027
00:57:46,355 --> 00:57:50,917
But there are other papers in New York,
right? So that's still a possibility.

1028
00:57:51,093 --> 00:57:52,253
I seriously doubt...

1029
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:57,296
...that if a paper like The Sentinel just cut
100 jobs that anybody's hiring right now.

1030
00:57:57,466 --> 00:58:00,435
Yeah, but listen,
you don't know that untiI you try.

1031
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:04,766
You're angry and you're frustrated
and I get it and I wish I could hug you.

1032
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:05,964
I know, I know.

1033
00:58:06,141 --> 00:58:09,235
That's the whole fucking problem
is you're there and I'm here...

1034
00:58:09,411 --> 00:58:13,905
...and I'm in this fucking kitchen right now,
and it fucking stinks.

1035
00:58:14,082 --> 00:58:17,984
Relax now, and try to get some sleep and
we'll make a new plan tomorrow. I promise.

1036
00:58:18,153 --> 00:58:19,620
Um, I gotta go, okay?

1037
00:58:19,788 --> 00:58:21,449
- Bye.
- I lov-

1038
00:58:26,695 --> 00:58:31,155
- Wanna do some more of that later?
- Yeah. Please.

1039
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:38,071
Long-distance fucking sucks.

1040
00:58:39,875 --> 00:58:42,571
Yep. Look, I told you it was rough.

1041
00:58:42,744 --> 00:58:44,507
I know. It's so rough.

1042
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:48,241
And even worse, I'm so horny.

1043
00:58:49,584 --> 00:58:52,314
There's definitely someone here
who can help you with that.

1044
00:58:53,088 --> 00:58:55,181
- Don't tempt me.
- I'm just saying.

1045
00:58:55,357 --> 00:58:58,019
What am I gonna do for a fucking job?

1046
00:58:58,193 --> 00:59:01,560
Okay? What am I gonna do with my life?

1047
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:03,627
I don't want to be a waitress forever.

1048
00:59:04,132 --> 00:59:05,759
No, seriously, listen to me.

1049
00:59:06,201 --> 00:59:09,329
I want to be a reporter.
I want to tell stories.

1050
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:11,597
What, like on the newspaper?

1051
00:59:11,773 --> 00:59:14,469
See, you understand. Fuck.

1052
00:59:16,044 --> 00:59:17,341
- Thank you.
- That's okay.

1053
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:19,036
There we go.

1054
00:59:21,149 --> 00:59:22,446
Jesus Christ.

1055
00:59:22,617 --> 00:59:25,484
Ha-ha-ha. Sorry.
- What the fuck is your problem?

1056
00:59:25,654 --> 00:59:29,647
Let me tell you, steroid-face. I'd think
you were comfortable with needles.

1057
00:59:29,825 --> 00:59:31,190
Watch yourself, sweetheart.

1058
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:33,452
Speaking of sweethearts,
you can suck my dick.

1059
00:59:33,628 --> 00:59:35,858
- She doesn't have a dick.
- I actually do.

1060
00:59:36,031 --> 00:59:37,055
No, she doesn't.

1061
00:59:37,232 --> 00:59:39,200
And you should put your mouth
on my penis.

1062
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:41,335
Get her out of here
before I kick your ass.

1063
00:59:41,503 --> 00:59:43,061
My friend is gonna kick your ass.

1064
00:59:43,238 --> 00:59:44,830
- Oh, is that right?
- No.

1065
00:59:45,006 --> 00:59:48,203
By the way, steroids have side effects.

1066
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:52,506
They may include a small dick,
worshipping of MichaeI Bay...

1067
00:59:52,681 --> 00:59:54,706
- You out of your mind?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1068
00:59:54,883 --> 00:59:58,683
We could all sit around and watch
Transformers together, jack off to it.

1069
00:59:58,854 --> 01:00:01,846
- Bye.
- Suck my dick, bitch.

1070
01:00:02,023 --> 01:00:03,490
Seriously.

1071
01:00:03,658 --> 01:00:05,148
Suck it!

1072
01:00:05,327 --> 01:00:06,521
Stupid fuck.

1073
01:00:06,695 --> 01:00:09,357
Let's get in there! We can take him!
Come on, let's go!

1074
01:00:09,531 --> 01:00:11,123
Son of a bitch.

1075
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:21,099
I need to get home.

1076
01:00:23,445 --> 01:00:26,380
Are you gonna be okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

1077
01:00:26,915 --> 01:00:28,507
I'm fine.

1078
01:00:53,075 --> 01:00:54,474
Hi.

1079
01:00:55,044 --> 01:00:58,070
Honey, I'm just gonna tell you right now,
Maya drew on your face.

1080
01:01:10,759 --> 01:01:12,021
Shit.

1081
01:01:21,603 --> 01:01:23,161
- Hello?
- Hello.

1082
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:26,069
Oh, my God.
I must've left you seven messages.

1083
01:01:26,241 --> 01:01:28,232
Please, please, God, tell me you're okay.

1084
01:01:28,777 --> 01:01:31,177
Yeah, I'm fine. I just- Unh.

1085
01:01:31,346 --> 01:01:35,976
I was out late last night with Damon.
I got reaI drunk.

1086
01:01:36,251 --> 01:01:37,343
Damon? Yeah?

1087
01:01:37,519 --> 01:01:41,148
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
He was just listening to me vent, you know.

1088
01:01:41,323 --> 01:01:43,791
- Wow. Okay.
- What's wrong?

1089
01:01:45,594 --> 01:01:48,427
- Nothing.
- Wait. Wait a minute.

1090
01:01:48,597 --> 01:01:50,189
Nothing happened, okay?

1091
01:01:50,566 --> 01:01:53,501
- Huh.
- You have nothing to worry about.

1092
01:01:53,669 --> 01:01:55,466
Please just tell me that you trust me.

1093
01:01:55,637 --> 01:01:58,037
3Z's in the conference room already.
Get in there.

1094
01:01:58,207 --> 01:01:59,936
Yeah. I'm sorry. Okay.

1095
01:02:00,109 --> 01:02:01,542
I gotta go. Can't talk.

1096
01:02:03,278 --> 01:02:05,405
Oh, shit.

1097
01:02:11,954 --> 01:02:13,216
Langford.

1098
01:02:13,388 --> 01:02:14,685
- Yes?
- Any luck?

1099
01:02:14,857 --> 01:02:18,156
Uh, no. Thank you for asking. Um-

1100
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:21,961
I've checked every newspaper
and magazine in New York...

1101
01:02:22,131 --> 01:02:23,860
...and all dead ends.

1102
01:02:24,032 --> 01:02:26,364
Well, the Chronicle has an opening,
miraculously...

1103
01:02:26,535 --> 01:02:29,470
...so I recommended you
and a few other students.

1104
01:02:30,772 --> 01:02:33,036
Thank you. Um-

1105
01:02:33,208 --> 01:02:35,938
I just- I sort of had my heart
set on New York.

1106
01:02:36,111 --> 01:02:40,514
Well, it's kind of brutaI out there.
You're not really in a position to be picky.

1107
01:02:41,483 --> 01:02:43,110
Okay.

1108
01:02:43,585 --> 01:02:44,643
Thank you.

1109
01:02:45,921 --> 01:02:48,719
San Francisco Chronicle, may I help you?

1110
01:02:54,596 --> 01:02:57,156
San Francisco Chronicle, please hold.

1111
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:01,897
- You can go in now.
- Thank you.

1112
01:03:04,673 --> 01:03:09,269
I'm looking for any job opportunities in
the San Francisco area, so if you know-

1113
01:03:10,412 --> 01:03:12,903
Totally, I get it.

1114
01:03:13,081 --> 01:03:15,106
Yeah. You know, I tried them, but-

1115
01:03:15,284 --> 01:03:17,582
Thank you, though. Okay, thank you.

1116
01:03:17,753 --> 01:03:20,051
Why don't you try blowing me next time?

1117
01:03:20,222 --> 01:03:21,746
Um...

1118
01:03:21,924 --> 01:03:23,448
- Okay.
- Not you.

1119
01:03:23,625 --> 01:03:26,059
Sorry, I'm dealing with some shit.

1120
01:03:26,228 --> 01:03:27,752
I'm sorry. Bad timing.

1121
01:03:27,930 --> 01:03:31,263
- It's okay. It's good to know.
- Oh. Fucking Evites.

1122
01:03:31,433 --> 01:03:34,368
It's for a month from now.
Who does that? Oh.

1123
01:03:34,536 --> 01:03:36,970
It's mine. It's for my birthday.

1124
01:03:41,543 --> 01:03:42,601
Shit.

1125
01:03:42,778 --> 01:03:46,043
Mark's coming in from Florida
and I really want him to meet everyone...

1126
01:03:46,215 --> 01:03:48,376
...so I kind of gotta plan ahead.

1127
01:03:48,750 --> 01:03:51,446
- I'm so sorry.
- No, it's okay.

1128
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:52,814
It's fine.

1129
01:03:52,988 --> 01:03:55,513
This is not an excuse,
but I'm so tired and frustrated.

1130
01:03:55,691 --> 01:03:58,489
I haven't seen my girlfriend in a while.
I'm losing my mind.

1131
01:03:58,660 --> 01:04:00,924
I'm in a long-distance relationship too,
I get it.

1132
01:04:01,096 --> 01:04:03,758
- It fucking sucks.
- Really does.

1133
01:04:03,932 --> 01:04:06,059
Tell me you have some suggestions.

1134
01:04:07,169 --> 01:04:08,636
Phone sex.

1135
01:04:09,004 --> 01:04:11,234
And, um, lots of it.

1136
01:04:16,678 --> 01:04:17,838
What are you wearing?

1137
01:04:20,182 --> 01:04:21,274
Uh...

1138
01:04:21,450 --> 01:04:26,786
Red lace panties and a bra and a garter.

1139
01:04:26,955 --> 01:04:29,321
Holy shit, you really went all out.

1140
01:04:29,925 --> 01:04:32,359
No, you fucking idiot, it's a fantasy.

1141
01:04:32,794 --> 01:04:35,092
- Oh, right.
- What are you wearing?

1142
01:04:35,264 --> 01:04:36,629
Um...

1143
01:04:36,999 --> 01:04:38,489
What do you think is sexy?

1144
01:04:39,001 --> 01:04:40,969
White boxer briefs.

1145
01:04:41,136 --> 01:04:43,195
Really? Like Marky Mark?

1146
01:04:43,372 --> 01:04:46,170
Oh, God, especially like Marky Mark.

1147
01:04:46,341 --> 01:04:48,002
If you even say "Marky Mark"...

1148
01:04:48,210 --> 01:04:52,044
- ... I'm gonna fucking come right now.
- Shit. Baby, please take this seriously.

1149
01:04:52,214 --> 01:04:54,682
Please. I'm so horny I can't even think.

1150
01:04:54,850 --> 01:04:58,081
- All right, sorry.
- Okay, um...

1151
01:04:58,854 --> 01:05:03,689
Okay, so tell me about something
that you're touching or whatever.

1152
01:05:03,859 --> 01:05:05,520
I'm touching myself.

1153
01:05:05,694 --> 01:05:08,356
Yeah, okay, good. Where?
Where are you touching yourself?

1154
01:05:08,530 --> 01:05:12,330
Everywhere. Absolutely everywhere,
all over, up and down.

1155
01:05:12,501 --> 01:05:15,197
- Up and down?
- Especially in the wet parts.

1156
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:16,803
Oh, God, yeah, that's good.

1157
01:05:16,972 --> 01:05:20,908
- I want to make good on that. Hold on.
- Erin? Erin.

1158
01:05:21,943 --> 01:05:23,638
Hello? I lost you.

1159
01:05:23,812 --> 01:05:25,973
- Did I lose you?
- Hello? Okay.

1160
01:05:26,148 --> 01:05:27,638
- Hello?
- I'm there.

1161
01:05:27,816 --> 01:05:30,649
- Okay, all right.
- Oh, God, I wanna fuck you so bad.

1162
01:05:30,819 --> 01:05:32,343
I wanna fuck you so hard.

1163
01:05:33,722 --> 01:05:35,383
I wanna come all over you.

1164
01:05:35,557 --> 01:05:38,492
No, I want you to come on the toweI
beside your pillow.

1165
01:05:38,660 --> 01:05:41,322
- Yeah, okay.
- I love fucking you so much.

1166
01:05:41,496 --> 01:05:43,964
You know what I fucking love doing?
I love riding you!

1167
01:05:44,132 --> 01:05:45,326
Oh, yeah.

1168
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:47,900
- Wait, wait, wait.
- God, I love fucking riding you!

1169
01:05:48,070 --> 01:05:50,971
- But I'm on top. Baby, I'm on top.
- No, I'm on top.

1170
01:05:51,139 --> 01:05:54,074
- I'm on top. How can you be on top?
- Because we're in your car.

1171
01:05:54,242 --> 01:05:55,334
No, we're on a plane.

1172
01:05:55,510 --> 01:05:57,705
Didn't I tell you that we're in your car?

1173
01:05:57,879 --> 01:06:01,508
You said the toweI next to my pillow.
Why would there be a pillow in the car?

1174
01:06:01,683 --> 01:06:03,776
Why would there be a toweI
on the plane?

1175
01:06:03,952 --> 01:06:06,113
They give out those hand towels
in first class.

1176
01:06:06,288 --> 01:06:09,621
Well, we wouldn't be in first class,
we'd be in coach.

1177
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:11,952
- Fine, we're in coach.
- What's everybody doing?

1178
01:06:12,127 --> 01:06:13,594
Are they watching us fucking?

1179
01:06:13,762 --> 01:06:15,889
We're in a bathroom.
We'll go in the bathroom.

1180
01:06:16,064 --> 01:06:18,589
I don't wanna get that blue toilet shit
all over me.

1181
01:06:18,767 --> 01:06:20,860
I'm not gonna put you in the toilet.

1182
01:06:21,036 --> 01:06:22,901
- Put the lid down-
- Gonna get arrested.

1183
01:06:23,438 --> 01:06:27,204
We're not gonna get arrested. We'll lock
the door. It's a fantasy! There's no-

1184
01:06:27,376 --> 01:06:31,039
Oh, Christ, you know what?
We'll go in the car. We'll go in the car.

1185
01:06:31,213 --> 01:06:33,909
Oh, fuck the car.

1186
01:06:34,449 --> 01:06:37,612
You know what?
I think the moment's passed.

1187
01:06:37,786 --> 01:06:39,048
This isn't really working.

1188
01:06:39,788 --> 01:06:41,153
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

1189
01:06:41,323 --> 01:06:44,292
You know, I thought "blue balls"
was just a saying...

1190
01:06:44,459 --> 01:06:47,121
...but I'm getting a lot
of veinage here.

1191
01:06:47,295 --> 01:06:49,422
I'm actually kind of concerned.

1192
01:06:49,598 --> 01:06:50,656
Oh, God.

1193
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:53,597
That's okay.

1194
01:06:53,769 --> 01:06:57,500
I'll just tighten the vise grip
on my dick one more notch.

1195
01:06:58,039 --> 01:07:00,405
- All right. You do that.
- All right.

1196
01:07:00,575 --> 01:07:02,008
- All right.
- Bye.

1197
01:07:02,177 --> 01:07:03,735
Bye.

1198
01:07:06,481 --> 01:07:08,108
Fuck!

1199
01:07:08,283 --> 01:07:11,411
You know, Garrett, I like the airplane.
People do cars too much.

1200
01:07:11,586 --> 01:07:14,453
Dan, are you kidding?

1201
01:07:37,145 --> 01:07:38,169
Hello?

1202
01:07:38,346 --> 01:07:41,804
Hello, Erin?
This is Sarah Conant at the Chronicle.

1203
01:07:41,983 --> 01:07:43,143
Hello.

1204
01:07:43,318 --> 01:07:46,185
Listen, we're all very impressed over here
by your work...

1205
01:07:46,354 --> 01:07:50,120
...and I would like to offer you the position
at our Metro desk.

1206
01:07:51,793 --> 01:07:54,159
- Really?
- Yes.

1207
01:07:54,329 --> 01:07:58,129
So we'll need you to come in
on April 15th at 10 a. m...

1208
01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:00,325
...and you can meet with our editors.

1209
01:08:00,502 --> 01:08:03,403
Okay. Thank you very much.

1210
01:08:03,572 --> 01:08:05,767
You're welcome. Bye-bye.

1211
01:08:43,512 --> 01:08:47,573
I'm sorry about not picking you up,
but I just really wanted to surprise you.

1212
01:08:47,816 --> 01:08:50,614
With the romance and the candles
and whatnot.

1213
01:08:53,822 --> 01:08:55,517
Hey, Erin.

1214
01:08:56,224 --> 01:08:58,283
Hi, Dan.

1215
01:08:58,460 --> 01:08:59,859
I missed you.

1216
01:09:00,028 --> 01:09:01,552
I missed you too, Dan.

1217
01:09:01,730 --> 01:09:03,197
I missed you so much.
- Dan.

1218
01:09:17,012 --> 01:09:18,377
Wait.

1219
01:09:19,481 --> 01:09:21,813
Just wait, wait, baby.
Wait a second, okay?

1220
01:09:25,253 --> 01:09:27,721
Okay. Can I be done waiting now?

1221
01:09:28,290 --> 01:09:30,224
- Listen, okay?
- What?

1222
01:09:30,392 --> 01:09:33,793
I just- I need a second.
I wanna look at your face.

1223
01:09:33,962 --> 01:09:36,226
And I've missed you.

1224
01:09:36,398 --> 01:09:38,730
Oh, my God, I've missed you too.

1225
01:09:41,069 --> 01:09:42,502
What is it? Something's wrong.

1226
01:09:43,071 --> 01:09:47,974
I am really, really getting tired of us
spending so much time apart.

1227
01:09:48,143 --> 01:09:51,112
I know. I know, but look,
we're here now, so-

1228
01:09:51,513 --> 01:09:52,878
Yeah.

1229
01:09:53,148 --> 01:09:54,172
And, um...

1230
01:09:55,617 --> 01:09:58,518
But there's a job.

1231
01:09:58,687 --> 01:10:00,848
What do you mean? What job?

1232
01:10:01,022 --> 01:10:05,049
Well, I interviewed
with the San Francisco Chronicle...

1233
01:10:05,226 --> 01:10:07,421
...and they offered me a job.

1234
01:10:07,862 --> 01:10:09,329
Wow.

1235
01:10:09,497 --> 01:10:11,362
That's great.

1236
01:10:11,533 --> 01:10:14,195
- Yeah.
- Are you gonna take it?

1237
01:10:15,537 --> 01:10:17,164
I don't know.

1238
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:21,331
Oh. Man.

1239
01:10:23,912 --> 01:10:25,573
Wow.

1240
01:10:25,747 --> 01:10:27,078
What?

1241
01:10:27,515 --> 01:10:29,779
- Nothing.
- No, not "nothing. " What?

1242
01:10:29,951 --> 01:10:32,784
It's a little strange to me...

1243
01:10:32,954 --> 01:10:35,252
...because in one breath
you're telling me...

1244
01:10:35,423 --> 01:10:38,290
...that it's hard to be apart
and you're struggling with this.

1245
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:43,261
And then in the next you're saying we
might be apart for a really long time.

1246
01:10:43,431 --> 01:10:45,797
No, I mean, I don't know yet, okay?

1247
01:10:45,967 --> 01:10:48,527
And my goaI is to be here with you.

1248
01:10:48,703 --> 01:10:53,663
But this is such a big opportunity for me
that we need to talk about it.

1249
01:10:53,842 --> 01:10:58,279
Yeah, let's talk about this huge bomb
you just laid on me.

1250
01:10:58,446 --> 01:11:01,108
Fuck, Erin, you didn't even tell me
you interviewed.

1251
01:11:01,282 --> 01:11:03,648
I didn't mean to keep it from you.

1252
01:11:03,818 --> 01:11:06,286
Well, you did.
What do you mean, you didn't mean to?

1253
01:11:06,454 --> 01:11:09,582
It's something you either do or you don't.
You make a choice.

1254
01:11:10,358 --> 01:11:13,486
You know, amazingly,
I'm not in the mood.

1255
01:11:14,396 --> 01:11:15,886
Fuck.

1256
01:11:16,064 --> 01:11:20,296
Erin, you know what?
Let's just go out. Let's just go out.

1257
01:11:21,169 --> 01:11:24,661
I don't know, I'm feeling sexy tonight,
you know what I'm saying?

1258
01:11:24,839 --> 01:11:29,606
I got a good feeling like I might be getting
laid by one of you ladies.

1259
01:11:29,778 --> 01:11:31,075
- Not it.
Not it.

1260
01:11:31,379 --> 01:11:32,869
Come on, Dan, just shoot pooI.

1261
01:11:33,048 --> 01:11:35,949
All right, okay. I'm just trying
to talk about how sexy I feeI.

1262
01:11:36,117 --> 01:11:37,948
I'm gonna go get another drink.

1263
01:11:46,795 --> 01:11:50,424
Well, if you need me
I'm right here

1264
01:11:50,598 --> 01:11:53,863
No matter what
I'm always near

1265
01:11:56,137 --> 01:11:57,695
Garrett.

1266
01:11:57,872 --> 01:11:59,362
- Hi.
- Hi.

1267
01:11:59,541 --> 01:12:00,735
What are you doing here?

1268
01:12:00,909 --> 01:12:02,376
Uh, Box invited me.

1269
01:12:02,744 --> 01:12:03,904
Of course.

1270
01:12:04,245 --> 01:12:06,372
- Do you wanna do a shot of Jger?
- Yes.

1271
01:12:06,548 --> 01:12:08,778
Hey, Christopher. Two.

1272
01:12:09,984 --> 01:12:11,975
This is so weird
to see you out of the off-

1273
01:12:12,153 --> 01:12:13,950
- You look great.
- Well, thanks.

1274
01:12:14,122 --> 01:12:15,384
Ahh. Thank you.

1275
01:12:15,557 --> 01:12:20,426
Hey. Um, I was just looking for you
because I wanted to- Hello.

1276
01:12:20,595 --> 01:12:22,392
- Hi.
Um...

1277
01:12:22,564 --> 01:12:26,261
Sorry, this is Erin, my, um...

1278
01:12:27,402 --> 01:12:30,132
GirI- Girlfriend.

1279
01:12:30,305 --> 01:12:32,296
This is Brianna, who I work with.
My friend.

1280
01:12:32,474 --> 01:12:33,998
It's so nice to finally meet you.

1281
01:12:34,175 --> 01:12:37,406
Garrett is always talking about you
and I hear your name all the time.

1282
01:12:37,579 --> 01:12:39,877
It's really nice to put a face to it.

1283
01:12:40,048 --> 01:12:42,482
- It's nice to meet you too.
Um...

1284
01:12:43,017 --> 01:12:46,316
So are you planning on moving out here
any time soon?

1285
01:12:46,488 --> 01:12:48,115
Ooh.

1286
01:12:48,289 --> 01:12:50,519
- Hell of a question.
- I don't know.

1287
01:12:50,692 --> 01:12:52,455
- I-
- She knows.

1288
01:12:52,627 --> 01:12:56,393
She got big news today that pertains
to that very question. Tell her.

1289
01:12:56,564 --> 01:12:59,158
Tell her your big news.
Tell her your big news.

1290
01:12:59,334 --> 01:13:01,825
Big news that I just found out about.

1291
01:13:03,304 --> 01:13:05,169
- No?
- It was nice to meet you.

1292
01:13:06,074 --> 01:13:08,338
- Yeah.
- Um...

1293
01:13:08,510 --> 01:13:13,311
I'm gonna go sleep at Brandy's
because it's obvious that you have-

1294
01:13:13,715 --> 01:13:16,149
I'm- Yeah, bye.

1295
01:13:19,287 --> 01:13:20,720
All right.

1296
01:13:24,759 --> 01:13:27,387
Here you go.
- Oh, good.

1297
01:13:29,664 --> 01:13:30,892
Well...

1298
01:13:31,199 --> 01:13:32,689
...cheers.

1299
01:13:36,137 --> 01:13:38,662
- Are you okay?
- Ha, ha. I am now.

1300
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:40,034
Ha, ha.

1301
01:13:40,208 --> 01:13:43,234
- You have a lot of jingle jangles.
- Yeah, she does.

1302
01:13:43,411 --> 01:13:44,673
- Hi.
Hi.

1303
01:13:44,846 --> 01:13:47,906
- Garrett, introductions.
- This is Dan. This is Brianna.

1304
01:13:48,082 --> 01:13:49,242
- Hi.
- DanieI.

1305
01:13:49,517 --> 01:13:51,348
- Oh.
- DanieI von...

1306
01:13:51,853 --> 01:13:52,877
...Jgermeister.

1307
01:13:53,087 --> 01:13:54,247
Hello, DanieI.

1308
01:13:54,422 --> 01:13:57,118
I'm a very wealthy man.
Garrett, can you buy us some shots?

1309
01:13:57,292 --> 01:13:59,317
Ha-ha-ha.
- Come on, let's get a drink.

1310
01:14:11,472 --> 01:14:12,905
What the fuck?

1311
01:14:13,942 --> 01:14:16,672
Fuck! Fuck! I don't know,
I don't know what I was thinking!

1312
01:14:16,845 --> 01:14:19,109
I got so drunk last night.

1313
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:22,272
I'm sorry. I drank so much.

1314
01:14:22,450 --> 01:14:25,078
Ha-ha-ha. Hey.

1315
01:14:26,387 --> 01:14:28,878
Knock, knock, in there.
How you doing, huh?

1316
01:14:29,057 --> 01:14:32,026
Hey, last night, awesome.

1317
01:14:32,193 --> 01:14:34,093
Seriously, the best sex of my life, ever.

1318
01:14:34,362 --> 01:14:36,353
You wanna go for round two?
Do it again?

1319
01:14:36,531 --> 01:14:38,863
Dan, you threw up on me!
I did throw up on you.

1320
01:14:39,033 --> 01:14:41,297
I threw up on you a little bit
and I apologized...

1321
01:14:41,469 --> 01:14:44,267
...and I thought we were past that.
I was hoping we were.

1322
01:14:44,439 --> 01:14:45,770
You cried all night.

1323
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:48,272
Crying is a part of feeling, all right?

1324
01:14:48,443 --> 01:14:51,276
Come on. You want some breakfast?
I'll cook you up some eggs.

1325
01:14:51,446 --> 01:14:54,040
I have a boyfriend.
That's not a problem for me.

1326
01:14:54,215 --> 01:14:55,375
Hey.

1327
01:14:55,550 --> 01:14:57,074
Hey.

1328
01:14:57,952 --> 01:14:59,476
Hey.

1329
01:15:08,029 --> 01:15:11,931
I should've just told you
about the interview, about everything.

1330
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:13,590
You know, no matter what.

1331
01:15:13,768 --> 01:15:15,360
No.

1332
01:15:15,670 --> 01:15:18,730
You know, we'll figure it out.

1333
01:15:18,907 --> 01:15:21,637
We'll just figure it out.

1334
01:15:24,445 --> 01:15:27,243
I know that you keep saying
that we're gonna figure it out...

1335
01:15:27,415 --> 01:15:30,248
...but we haven't.

1336
01:15:30,652 --> 01:15:32,176
But we will.

1337
01:15:32,353 --> 01:15:37,222
But we haven't and we need
to make a decision right away.

1338
01:15:37,625 --> 01:15:39,456
Okay, well, uh...

1339
01:15:39,861 --> 01:15:41,658
Yeah, I know. Make a decision, then.

1340
01:15:42,096 --> 01:15:43,358
Why is this all on me?

1341
01:15:43,531 --> 01:15:46,022
What are you talking about, "why you"?
Your decision.

1342
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:48,532
So it's all about whether
I move to New York?

1343
01:15:48,703 --> 01:15:50,500
What about you moving
to San Francisco?

1344
01:15:50,672 --> 01:15:53,937
You kidding? I've been calling music labels
there for the last month...

1345
01:15:54,108 --> 01:15:55,973
...every day, diligently.

1346
01:15:56,144 --> 01:15:58,271
I called a labeI that turned out
to be a kid...

1347
01:15:58,446 --> 01:16:01,677
...who's collecting demos from his friends.
He didn't want to hire me.

1348
01:16:02,050 --> 01:16:05,349
There's nothing. There are no jobs.
Trust me, I called them all.

1349
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:08,853
I love that you're fine with me
moving to New York and waiting tables...

1350
01:16:09,023 --> 01:16:12,652
...but you wouldn't even think about
serving coffee in fucking San Francisco.

1351
01:16:12,827 --> 01:16:15,455
- It's all about what's convenient for you.
- Wait.

1352
01:16:15,630 --> 01:16:17,120
And you hate your job.

1353
01:16:19,667 --> 01:16:22,363
Fine, I'll just make the decision
for both of us.

1354
01:16:22,537 --> 01:16:24,732
You can just totally leave it all on me.

1355
01:16:25,139 --> 01:16:26,470
I got it.

1356
01:16:38,152 --> 01:16:39,642
Look at me, oh, look at me

1357
01:16:39,821 --> 01:16:44,952
Is this the way I'll always be?
Oh, no, oh, no

1358
01:16:45,126 --> 01:16:47,321
Jesus, Harper.
Maybe be a little more subtle?

1359
01:16:47,495 --> 01:16:50,259
I'm checking out their packages.
They want you to look.

1360
01:16:50,431 --> 01:16:53,059
Oh, that's gross.
- It's not gross, actually. Strangely.

1361
01:16:53,234 --> 01:16:57,193
- Um, hello?
Hey, Erin. What are you doing?

1362
01:16:57,372 --> 01:16:59,169
- Hello?
- I can't hear you.

1363
01:16:59,340 --> 01:17:01,535
- Where are you?
- Huh?

1364
01:17:01,843 --> 01:17:04,368
- Where are you?
- Oh!

1365
01:17:04,545 --> 01:17:08,003
I'm at, like, this sketchy club.
It's girls' night out.

1366
01:17:08,182 --> 01:17:10,548
Oh, fun.

1367
01:17:10,718 --> 01:17:12,015
I can't hear you.

1368
01:17:12,186 --> 01:17:15,349
- Go outside.
- Hold on.

1369
01:17:15,523 --> 01:17:18,219
You guys save mine.
I gotta go outside and talk to Garrett.

1370
01:17:18,393 --> 01:17:20,554
He's an asshole.
Tell him to move here already.

1371
01:17:20,728 --> 01:17:22,662
Hey, Garrett.

1372
01:17:22,830 --> 01:17:25,230
- It's Harper. How you doing?
- Hey, Harper.

1373
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:27,129
Look, Erin can't come to the phone...

1374
01:17:27,301 --> 01:17:30,498
...because she's gonna meet a guy
who lives here and respects her...

1375
01:17:30,671 --> 01:17:33,401
...and she's gonna make out with him
and have his baby.

1376
01:17:33,574 --> 01:17:35,098
What?

1377
01:17:35,276 --> 01:17:38,177
I'm sorry.
You know, I shouldn't drink tequila.

1378
01:17:38,346 --> 01:17:40,280
Yeah, I know. It's okay.

1379
01:17:40,615 --> 01:17:43,778
No, it's just- You know Harper,
she's out of her fucking mind.

1380
01:17:43,951 --> 01:17:47,409
- Why was she saying all that stuff?
- Look, don't worry about it, okay?

1381
01:17:47,588 --> 01:17:49,852
I told her about the fight, you know?

1382
01:17:50,024 --> 01:17:53,653
I had to, I'm sorry. I'm a fucking girI,
that's what we do. We talk it out.

1383
01:17:53,828 --> 01:17:55,489
- Right.
- Do you get it?

1384
01:17:55,663 --> 01:17:57,688
Sure, I've seen Moesha.

1385
01:17:57,865 --> 01:17:59,628
CooI. Okay, what's going on with you?

1386
01:17:59,801 --> 01:18:04,738
Hey, listen. I know you're on a deadline
to make a decision about this Chronicle job.

1387
01:18:04,906 --> 01:18:08,467
I know that, and you were right, by
the way. You should not be in this alone.

1388
01:18:08,643 --> 01:18:12,170
I wanna help you
and we're in this together, right?

1389
01:18:12,647 --> 01:18:16,777
But that being said,
I gotta be honest with you.

1390
01:18:17,185 --> 01:18:18,482
I want you in New York.

1391
01:18:18,653 --> 01:18:22,453
But not just you in New York, I want you
and me in New York living together.

1392
01:18:22,623 --> 01:18:25,023
I wanna get a place with you,
a place that you love.

1393
01:18:25,193 --> 01:18:26,820
A place that we can make our own...

1394
01:18:26,994 --> 01:18:29,588
...where we can put Tom Cruise
all over the walls...

1395
01:18:29,764 --> 01:18:34,201
...and get Tom Cruise bed sheets
and Tom Cruise toilet paper.

1396
01:18:34,368 --> 01:18:36,359
Or we could buy our own Centipede
machine...

1397
01:18:36,537 --> 01:18:38,801
...and drink jugs of Sunshine Harbor
all day.

1398
01:18:38,973 --> 01:18:41,032
I just want a real relationship with you...

1399
01:18:41,209 --> 01:18:44,667
...because I love you
and you're my best friend.

1400
01:18:45,079 --> 01:18:49,743
And frankly, I am so tired of missing you.

1401
01:18:50,017 --> 01:18:52,008
And I know this is a lot to put on you.

1402
01:18:52,186 --> 01:18:56,088
And I'm open to whatever...

1403
01:18:56,557 --> 01:19:00,687
...but I really wanna come out and see you
and figure all of this out together.

1404
01:19:01,562 --> 01:19:03,325
I'd like that.

1405
01:19:03,831 --> 01:19:06,299
Okay. Good.

1406
01:19:06,467 --> 01:19:09,265
- Okay.
- Bye.

1407
01:19:09,437 --> 01:19:11,064
Bye.

1408
01:19:52,013 --> 01:19:55,380
Maya Papaya.
Where's Erin? Is she here?

1409
01:19:55,550 --> 01:19:57,677
She's upstairs in the shower.

1410
01:19:58,252 --> 01:20:00,743
- Baby? Hey.
Uh-huh?

1411
01:20:00,955 --> 01:20:03,753
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi.

1412
01:20:03,925 --> 01:20:05,517
- Hi.
- Hi.

1413
01:20:06,360 --> 01:20:08,885
- God, I missed you.
- I missed you too.

1414
01:20:09,063 --> 01:20:11,088
- Listen...
- What?

1415
01:20:11,265 --> 01:20:12,459
I wanna move to New York.

1416
01:20:13,734 --> 01:20:14,758
Are you serious?

1417
01:20:16,204 --> 01:20:17,501
Yes.

1418
01:20:17,905 --> 01:20:19,236
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

1419
01:20:23,911 --> 01:20:26,209
So have you told the Chronicle yet?

1420
01:20:26,747 --> 01:20:29,648
No. I'm sort of waiting till Monday.

1421
01:20:30,451 --> 01:20:31,509
Okay.

1422
01:20:31,686 --> 01:20:34,246
PhiI wants to know if you guys
wanna watch The Notebook.

1423
01:20:34,422 --> 01:20:36,549
- Where you going?
Going inside.

1424
01:20:37,458 --> 01:20:39,949
Hey, Garrett.
- Hey. Do you need help?

1425
01:20:40,127 --> 01:20:42,061
- You can grab that for me.
- Okay.

1426
01:20:42,230 --> 01:20:44,221
- Start putting them on.
- Great.

1427
01:20:44,398 --> 01:20:45,922
So...

1428
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:47,465
Must be excited, huh?

1429
01:20:47,635 --> 01:20:49,364
Yeah. Excited.

1430
01:20:49,537 --> 01:20:51,004
It's wonderfuI.

1431
01:20:52,406 --> 01:20:54,874
You know, Garrett,
how much I love my sister, right?

1432
01:20:55,042 --> 01:20:56,202
Of course.

1433
01:20:56,377 --> 01:20:58,937
I mean, she means everything to me.

1434
01:20:59,113 --> 01:21:02,105
And that, as you can see,
I'm very protective of her.

1435
01:21:02,283 --> 01:21:06,310
So it's been very hard for me watching her
struggle with this decision...

1436
01:21:06,487 --> 01:21:09,320
...to come with you
or to take this incredible job.

1437
01:21:10,224 --> 01:21:11,816
But, you know...

1438
01:21:11,993 --> 01:21:13,255
...she loves you.

1439
01:21:13,427 --> 01:21:16,260
And, uh, I know how much you love her.

1440
01:21:17,265 --> 01:21:20,996
But you need to know how much
she's giving up to be with you.

1441
01:21:21,168 --> 01:21:22,965
So don't break her heart.

1442
01:21:23,137 --> 01:21:24,627
Okay?

1443
01:21:26,674 --> 01:21:28,539
Or I'll cut your balls off.

1444
01:21:29,310 --> 01:21:31,710
- I'm not fucking kidding.
- Okay.

1445
01:21:32,780 --> 01:21:34,577
- I'm kidding.
- Jesus Christ.

1446
01:21:34,749 --> 01:21:36,740
- I'm kidding.
- Um...

1447
01:21:36,917 --> 01:21:38,475
Thanks.

1448
01:21:44,125 --> 01:21:45,490
Um...

1449
01:21:45,660 --> 01:21:47,059
- So should I-?
- Take those in.

1450
01:21:47,228 --> 01:21:48,627
- Yep. Okay.
- Thanks.

1451
01:21:52,566 --> 01:21:54,033
Fucker.

1452
01:21:56,937 --> 01:21:59,804
Yeah, I wish I had lived in New York
at some point in my life.

1453
01:21:59,974 --> 01:22:00,998
Oh, yeah?

1454
01:22:01,309 --> 01:22:04,403
I feeI like I could have really
shaken up that place.

1455
01:22:07,648 --> 01:22:11,106
So, what are your plans for work?

1456
01:22:11,319 --> 01:22:14,914
Oh, I'm gonna wait tables
untiI I figure it out.

1457
01:22:15,089 --> 01:22:16,579
You still gonna do the writing?

1458
01:22:16,757 --> 01:22:19,419
- There are no jobs in New York, PhiI.
Mm.

1459
01:22:19,593 --> 01:22:22,357
Well, I mean, you know, not right now...

1460
01:22:22,530 --> 01:22:27,024
...but I think the newspaper business
is gonna bounce back.

1461
01:22:27,201 --> 01:22:30,500
Oh, yeah. No, that is a sensible gamble.

1462
01:22:30,671 --> 01:22:32,070
I can see Corinne's convinced.

1463
01:22:33,441 --> 01:22:34,533
She's onboard.

1464
01:22:34,709 --> 01:22:37,576
Well, you can always write just to write.

1465
01:22:37,745 --> 01:22:39,508
No one can stop you from doing that.

1466
01:22:40,915 --> 01:22:43,975
I'm not gonna not do what I do.

1467
01:22:44,151 --> 01:22:46,915
I just might take a while, you know.

1468
01:22:47,088 --> 01:22:48,555
I'm not gonna give it up.

1469
01:22:48,723 --> 01:22:53,183
Well, even if you did, you'd still be there
for Garrett, which is the important thing.

1470
01:22:54,795 --> 01:22:56,092
Exactly.

1471
01:23:08,843 --> 01:23:10,174
Hey.
- Hey.

1472
01:23:10,378 --> 01:23:12,608
I was looking for you.

1473
01:23:12,913 --> 01:23:14,175
How you doing?

1474
01:23:14,382 --> 01:23:16,350
I'm okay, how are you?

1475
01:23:16,517 --> 01:23:19,543
Good. You wanna take a little walk?

1476
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:21,387
Sure.

1477
01:23:21,989 --> 01:23:23,752
Come on.

1478
01:23:26,761 --> 01:23:28,729
What are you doing out here?

1479
01:23:28,896 --> 01:23:30,557
Nothing.

1480
01:23:40,207 --> 01:23:41,231
What's going on?

1481
01:23:42,510 --> 01:23:43,807
You have to take the job.

1482
01:23:43,978 --> 01:23:47,573
No. No, I'm not gonna give up
our relationship for a job.

1483
01:23:47,748 --> 01:23:50,444
No, no, no. Lookit, lookit.

1484
01:23:50,818 --> 01:23:52,752
You need to take the job.

1485
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:55,912
You need to take the job.
This is not about our relationship.

1486
01:23:56,090 --> 01:24:00,322
This is about asking you to give up
everything again, and I'm not gonna do it.

1487
01:24:00,494 --> 01:24:02,428
I'm not gonna do it.

1488
01:24:03,030 --> 01:24:06,295
And if you moved to New York,
it'd be great for a little while.

1489
01:24:06,467 --> 01:24:09,368
But you'd eventually resent me,
and I can't live with that.

1490
01:24:09,937 --> 01:24:11,427
I can't. I won't.

1491
01:24:12,306 --> 01:24:14,137
What's gonna happen to us?

1492
01:24:16,210 --> 01:24:18,178
We can't see each other
every three months.

1493
01:24:18,345 --> 01:24:20,210
That's not a relationship.

1494
01:24:24,985 --> 01:24:26,782
But I love you.

1495
01:24:45,339 --> 01:24:46,829
This is...

1496
01:24:48,242 --> 01:24:51,302
- Why don't we just sit down for a minute?
- Yeah.

1497
01:25:03,524 --> 01:25:07,153
I really thought that we were something.

1498
01:25:08,729 --> 01:25:10,321
We were.

1499
01:25:11,699 --> 01:25:13,599
We were something.

1500
01:25:50,571 --> 01:25:53,972
He's here. No, I'm picking him up now.
All right, hold on one sec.

1501
01:25:54,141 --> 01:25:55,574
- How you doing?
- Hey, buddy.

1502
01:25:55,743 --> 01:25:57,472
- What do you think, home or bar?
- Bar.

1503
01:25:57,645 --> 01:25:58,737
Bar. All right.

1504
01:25:58,913 --> 01:26:00,278
Yeah, I'm really disturbed...

1505
01:26:00,447 --> 01:26:03,780
...because you would think that you would
find a baby pigeon somewhere.

1506
01:26:03,951 --> 01:26:05,748
But I don't see baby pigeons ever.

1507
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:08,855
So, what do you want to do?
Do you just want to have this beer?

1508
01:26:09,023 --> 01:26:12,686
I mean, we can get you some harder liquor,
if you want to get really fucked up.

1509
01:26:12,860 --> 01:26:15,658
- No, this is good, buddy. Thanks, paI.
- CooI. All right.

1510
01:26:15,829 --> 01:26:18,593
Drink a little Frangelico?
No Sambuca shots? Nothing fun?

1511
01:26:18,766 --> 01:26:22,634
If you wanna dive off the deep end
into the sadness pooI, we go to my place...

1512
01:26:22,803 --> 01:26:26,432
...listen to, like, the Garden State
soundtrack, watch Brian's Song.

1513
01:26:26,607 --> 01:26:29,599
- That probably wouldn't be the best thing.
- Want a hug?

1514
01:26:30,344 --> 01:26:32,778
I'm okay, buddy. Thanks. This is good.

1515
01:26:32,947 --> 01:26:34,778
- I want to hug you.
It's okay.

1516
01:26:34,949 --> 01:26:38,783
You need a hug, man. Come on, man.
Come on, buddy. There you go.

1517
01:26:38,953 --> 01:26:41,319
Okay. Thanks.

1518
01:26:41,755 --> 01:26:43,655
Why are your eyes closed?

1519
01:26:44,892 --> 01:26:45,950
- Mine?
- Mm-hm.

1520
01:26:46,126 --> 01:26:48,094
- Are yours not closed?
- No.

1521
01:26:48,262 --> 01:26:49,752
Oh.

1522
01:26:50,264 --> 01:26:51,731
Are your eyes-?

1523
01:26:51,899 --> 01:26:53,799
I just close my eyes when I hug.

1524
01:26:54,401 --> 01:26:55,891
No big deaI.

1525
01:27:09,249 --> 01:27:10,841
You playing?

1526
01:27:11,418 --> 01:27:13,943
- Yeah.
- You any good?

1527
01:27:14,521 --> 01:27:16,853
- I'm okay.
- Damn.

1528
01:27:17,491 --> 01:27:20,051
That's one hell of a high score.

1529
01:27:20,361 --> 01:27:24,092
Yeah. Gonna be reaI tough to beat.

1530
01:27:43,651 --> 01:27:46,245
Hey, Erin, congratulations
on your front-page story.

1531
01:27:46,420 --> 01:27:49,184
Thank you.
I can't believe I'm on the cover. Heh.

1532
01:27:52,793 --> 01:27:57,287
So keep an open mind. Okay, we are
really lucky to be getting in here early.

1533
01:27:57,464 --> 01:28:00,297
I got a tip from Chuck at the Crime desk.

1534
01:28:00,467 --> 01:28:02,230
And it's a sublet...

1535
01:28:02,403 --> 01:28:06,134
...and it's right in my price range,
and it's available for ten years.

1536
01:28:06,306 --> 01:28:08,934
Are you kidd-? Is this blood?
Is this blood on the wall?

1537
01:28:09,843 --> 01:28:11,572
Did someone get bludgeoned in here?

1538
01:28:11,745 --> 01:28:14,236
I'm not really sure of the details.

1539
01:28:14,415 --> 01:28:18,909
Something about a narcotics bust
or a cockfighting ring.

1540
01:28:19,620 --> 01:28:21,451
But let's be positive.

1541
01:28:21,622 --> 01:28:24,921
Yes. No, you're right. You're right.
Maybe it's just feces.

1542
01:28:25,092 --> 01:28:26,559
I think it's an up-and-comer.

1543
01:28:27,795 --> 01:28:32,095
They got a Boston Market on the corner.
They don't build those just any place.

1544
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:34,734
It smells like a skin infection in there.

1545
01:28:34,902 --> 01:28:36,392
Smells like freedom to me.

1546
01:28:37,137 --> 01:28:40,698
The happiest people I know
are single and living alone.

1547
01:28:40,874 --> 01:28:43,638
Grab it, Erin.
Before you know it, it'll be done.

1548
01:28:43,811 --> 01:28:47,076
You'll be trapped and dead.
You gotta do it.

1549
01:28:47,247 --> 01:28:48,578
Are you kidding? It's a shit hole.

1550
01:28:49,917 --> 01:28:52,010
The reason your conversation
is having a soundtrack...

1551
01:28:52,186 --> 01:28:54,347
...is because the walls are paper-thin,
all right?

1552
01:28:54,521 --> 01:28:56,785
Erin, you're not gonna
have any privacy in here.

1553
01:28:57,124 --> 01:29:01,424
I actually like music that comes through
the walls. I find it comforting.

1554
01:29:01,595 --> 01:29:03,290
I'm gonna take this place.

1555
01:29:03,464 --> 01:29:06,365
And I so appreciate what you and PhiI
have done for me...

1556
01:29:06,533 --> 01:29:08,262
...but it is time for me to move out.

1557
01:29:08,435 --> 01:29:11,563
I think you got a view
of the Transamerica building. Oh-

1558
01:29:12,473 --> 01:29:17,570
Erin, I know you love this place, but there's
a creepy man watching us hug right now.

1559
01:29:17,745 --> 01:29:19,975
Really?
- Yeah.

1560
01:29:20,147 --> 01:29:21,774
Yeah.

1561
01:29:22,850 --> 01:29:25,011
- Let's go.
- Yeah. Okay.

1562
01:29:25,185 --> 01:29:26,447
All right. You were right.

1563
01:29:26,620 --> 01:29:29,783
- PhiI. PhiI!
- Oh.

1564
01:29:31,558 --> 01:29:35,426
- Can we go to Boston Market?
We cannot go to Boston Market.

1565
01:29:35,596 --> 01:29:36,927
Any way you want it

1566
01:29:37,097 --> 01:29:38,655
That's the way you need it

1567
01:29:38,832 --> 01:29:40,493
Ah. I look like such an idiot.

1568
01:29:40,667 --> 01:29:41,793
Trust me. It works.

1569
01:29:41,969 --> 01:29:44,164
But I'm not into
older women. That's your thing.

1570
01:29:44,338 --> 01:29:46,203
But you asked me for my help, all right?

1571
01:29:46,373 --> 01:29:50,309
You have a problem, I have a solution.
These women are good to go.

1572
01:29:51,345 --> 01:29:54,041
Yeah, good to go to an early bird speciaI
at Denny's.

1573
01:29:54,214 --> 01:29:56,648
You haven't been out with a lady
in what, six months.

1574
01:29:56,817 --> 01:29:58,978
So this is about getting back
on the horse.

1575
01:29:59,153 --> 01:30:00,279
Yeah. No, I know.

1576
01:30:00,454 --> 01:30:04,481
Now, sure, you're not gonna find yourself
a Kentucky Derby winner here tonight...

1577
01:30:04,658 --> 01:30:07,991
...but you might find a nice horse
to ride down the Grand Canyon on.

1578
01:30:08,162 --> 01:30:10,130
You get to the bottom
of the Grand Canyon...

1579
01:30:10,297 --> 01:30:12,390
...drop her off and
you go about your business.

1580
01:30:12,566 --> 01:30:13,863
That makes it worse.

1581
01:30:14,034 --> 01:30:16,867
Wooh! Sorry I'm running late, boys.

1582
01:30:17,037 --> 01:30:18,368
Three beers, yes?

1583
01:30:18,539 --> 01:30:20,439
Oh, no.
- What's going on?

1584
01:30:20,607 --> 01:30:22,404
- What the fuck?
- Holy shit.

1585
01:30:22,576 --> 01:30:25,238
What? You're not Charlie Chaplin fans?
This is gonna kill.

1586
01:30:25,412 --> 01:30:27,209
I love Charlie Chaplin.

1587
01:30:27,381 --> 01:30:29,815
I'm not a fan of the guy
that has the exact mustache.

1588
01:30:29,983 --> 01:30:31,382
Where are you going with this?

1589
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:33,452
At no point during shaving
did you think:

1590
01:30:33,620 --> 01:30:37,147
- "CooI it. I'm gonna look like Hitler"?
- Hitler? Oh, yeah, thought of that.

1591
01:30:37,324 --> 01:30:38,416
It's the plastered hair.

1592
01:30:38,592 --> 01:30:40,583
I knew you guys
were gonna give me shit.

1593
01:30:40,761 --> 01:30:43,730
I'm shaving it, and then... I get that
way too far on this side.

1594
01:30:43,897 --> 01:30:45,865
- Too far.
- I went too far down this side.

1595
01:30:46,033 --> 01:30:48,729
I started going back and forth,
back and forth. I stop.

1596
01:30:48,902 --> 01:30:51,928
If I stop now, and you can
still pull off Chaplin. You know what?

1597
01:30:52,105 --> 01:30:54,801
If you don't like it,
I'll send you to the gas chamber.

1598
01:30:54,975 --> 01:30:57,341
- You are doing Hitler.
- I'll do whoever I want.

1599
01:30:57,511 --> 01:30:58,773
Pick a character and go-

1600
01:30:58,946 --> 01:31:01,278
- Hey, game faces. Hello.
- Hi.

1601
01:31:01,448 --> 01:31:02,779
- How you doing?
- Good.

1602
01:31:02,950 --> 01:31:05,214
You guys didn't go to schooI with us.

1603
01:31:05,385 --> 01:31:06,852
We did not. No.

1604
01:31:07,020 --> 01:31:09,250
You have a very foxy eye for detaiI.

1605
01:31:09,656 --> 01:31:12,591
- Wanna dance?
- I do.

1606
01:31:13,660 --> 01:31:15,525
- Time machine.
- Yeah.

1607
01:31:15,696 --> 01:31:17,561
Maybe my friend Garrett here
can join us?

1608
01:31:17,731 --> 01:31:20,495
I'm good. No. I'm good.
I'm gonna sit this one out.

1609
01:31:20,667 --> 01:31:22,635
- Bye, gentlemen. Shall we?
Let's do it.

1610
01:31:23,003 --> 01:31:26,769
Hold on, hold on

1611
01:31:26,940 --> 01:31:28,567
Oh, man, this is ridiculous.

1612
01:31:28,742 --> 01:31:30,471
I know it's ridiculous.

1613
01:31:30,644 --> 01:31:33,909
- You know you don't have to be here.
- You think I'm gonna miss this?

1614
01:31:34,081 --> 01:31:36,914
No. Well, yeah. No, not this though.
I mean-

1615
01:31:38,285 --> 01:31:42,619
Look, Box and I, this is what we do.
We do stupid shit, and we'll be fine.

1616
01:31:42,789 --> 01:31:45,417
So if you're worried about us,
don't worry about us, man.

1617
01:31:45,592 --> 01:31:47,423
But you, you don't need to be here.

1618
01:31:47,995 --> 01:31:49,929
Yeah. I know.

1619
01:31:50,264 --> 01:31:52,630
Okay, then.
As long as you're thinking about it.

1620
01:31:52,799 --> 01:31:54,494
- Okay.
- I'm taking off.

1621
01:31:54,668 --> 01:31:56,829
These dudes don't look
like Chaplin fans to me.

1622
01:31:57,004 --> 01:31:59,734
Oh, boy.
They look like angry Jews.

1623
01:32:02,042 --> 01:32:03,339
Sorry.

1624
01:32:24,564 --> 01:32:26,896
Hello.
- Hello.

1625
01:32:27,067 --> 01:32:28,432
How was work?

1626
01:32:28,602 --> 01:32:31,969
- You know? Uh, it was awesome.
- Good.

1627
01:32:32,139 --> 01:32:34,130
Oh, hey. You got a package today.

1628
01:32:34,308 --> 01:32:36,435
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hm.

1629
01:32:48,455 --> 01:32:50,946
It's from Garrett.

1630
01:32:55,295 --> 01:32:58,628
Oh. What does it say?

1631
01:32:59,166 --> 01:33:02,932
"They're gonna be in San Francisco.
Thought you might wanna go. "

1632
01:33:03,337 --> 01:33:04,565
Who is?

1633
01:33:07,140 --> 01:33:09,165
The Boxer Rebellion.

1634
01:33:09,776 --> 01:33:12,472
That was one of the first bands
that we saw together.

1635
01:33:14,414 --> 01:33:15,438
Are you gonna go?

1636
01:33:17,918 --> 01:33:19,510
That depends.

1637
01:33:20,253 --> 01:33:22,221
On whether or not you'll be my date.

1638
01:33:23,056 --> 01:33:24,523
I can get drunk there, right?

1639
01:33:25,058 --> 01:33:28,858
There's sort of
an unidentifiable smell in here...

1640
01:33:29,029 --> 01:33:32,021
...that I can't quite just put my finger on.

1641
01:33:32,199 --> 01:33:34,133
I don't know, but just push your way in.

1642
01:33:34,301 --> 01:33:36,997
It's urine. It's urine. I smell urine.

1643
01:33:37,170 --> 01:33:39,638
Oh, good. That means it's a good club.

1644
01:33:39,806 --> 01:33:43,105
And puke. Oh, yeah.
There's a hint of puke. And urine.

1645
01:33:43,276 --> 01:33:45,403
Well, that's even better.
- I know, then. Good.

1646
01:34:00,794 --> 01:34:02,421
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

1647
01:34:04,264 --> 01:34:05,697
Hi.

1648
01:34:07,267 --> 01:34:08,325
Hi, Corinne.

1649
01:34:08,502 --> 01:34:11,699
- Hey, Garrett. I like your haircut.
- Thanks. Did something different.

1650
01:34:11,872 --> 01:34:14,534
And your dick's in your pants,
so that's good.

1651
01:34:15,575 --> 01:34:19,511
I'm gonna go check out the...

1652
01:34:19,679 --> 01:34:22,546
Oh, fuck it. I'm just not gonna be here.
Okay? Okay?

1653
01:34:22,716 --> 01:34:23,978
You're gonna just-?

1654
01:34:29,456 --> 01:34:31,083
- Hi.
- Hi.

1655
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:34,525
What are you doing here?

1656
01:34:34,694 --> 01:34:36,184
I manage the band.

1657
01:34:36,363 --> 01:34:39,196
- You do?
- Yes. Ha, ha. Crazy, I know.

1658
01:34:39,366 --> 01:34:41,357
- Really?
- Yeah.

1659
01:34:41,768 --> 01:34:45,568
That's- That's great.

1660
01:34:46,073 --> 01:34:47,904
- Really?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1661
01:34:48,075 --> 01:34:51,670
- Wow.
- No, I left the labeI.

1662
01:34:51,845 --> 01:34:55,281
You were right, as it turns out.
I hated the hell out of my job.

1663
01:34:55,916 --> 01:34:58,714
Well, I hate to say "I told you so. "

1664
01:34:58,885 --> 01:35:01,251
No, you don't.
You love saying "I told you so. "

1665
01:35:01,421 --> 01:35:02,718
- You love it.
- You're right.

1666
01:35:02,889 --> 01:35:04,356
Who are you kidding?

1667
01:35:07,127 --> 01:35:09,618
So are you living in New York?

1668
01:35:11,098 --> 01:35:13,066
I actually just moved to Los Angeles.

1669
01:35:13,233 --> 01:35:14,495
- Really?
- Yeah.

1670
01:35:14,668 --> 01:35:16,932
The band actually lives in L.A.

1671
01:35:17,104 --> 01:35:21,404
And, I don't know if you know this,
I know you're not a huge geography fan...

1672
01:35:21,575 --> 01:35:24,635
...but L.A. is not only in the same
time zone as San Francisco...

1673
01:35:24,811 --> 01:35:27,678
...it's in the same state. So...

1674
01:35:27,848 --> 01:35:30,248
Yeah. It's very close.

1675
01:35:30,417 --> 01:35:32,908
Yeah. It's a one-hour flight.

1676
01:35:33,453 --> 01:35:35,387
A six-hour drive.

1677
01:35:36,189 --> 01:35:39,647
- Eighteen-hour hot-air balloon ride.
- Ha-ha-ha.

1678
01:35:39,826 --> 01:35:41,418
If you were to go that way.

1679
01:35:44,965 --> 01:35:46,899
Can I ask you a question?

1680
01:35:47,334 --> 01:35:48,892
Yeah.

1681
01:35:50,537 --> 01:35:53,028
I don't know what your situation is...

1682
01:35:55,842 --> 01:35:57,434
I miss you.

1683
01:36:00,847 --> 01:36:03,111
That's not a question.

1684
01:36:04,317 --> 01:36:06,012
Yeah, it is.

1685
01:36:11,424 --> 01:36:16,191
I'm always here

1686
01:36:17,697 --> 01:36:23,135
Waiting for you
All alone

1687
01:36:25,672 --> 01:36:30,041
Eyes of the night

1688
01:36:31,845 --> 01:36:36,908
Just to see
See you home

1689
01:36:39,219 --> 01:36:46,182
There's two of us
In it

1690
01:36:46,359 --> 01:36:53,492
They follow
All night

1691
01:36:54,768 --> 01:36:57,396
I can't believe she left
without us. That's so weird.

1692
01:36:57,571 --> 01:37:00,404
It's a schooI night
and she probably didn't like the band.

1693
01:37:00,574 --> 01:37:03,065
She didn't like-
She didn't like me. She hates me.

1694
01:37:03,243 --> 01:37:05,074
How am I gonna win that crazy one over?

1695
01:37:05,245 --> 01:37:07,645
Now that we're spending more time
with each other...

1696
01:37:07,814 --> 01:37:11,614
...which I couldn't be happier about,
maybe you should get your own apartment.

1697
01:37:11,785 --> 01:37:14,686
Just so we don't have to sneak around
her house, you know, like teenagers.

1698
01:37:14,854 --> 01:37:18,551
Shh. But for tonight,
let's just go upstairs, like adults.

1699
01:37:18,725 --> 01:37:21,057
That's very mature.
- Okay.

1700
01:37:22,529 --> 01:37:23,996
Shh, shh, shh.

1701
01:37:24,164 --> 01:37:25,495
Wait, wait, wait.

1702
01:37:32,572 --> 01:37:33,596
C- Uh-

1703
01:37:33,773 --> 01:37:36,241
Are you guys-? Are you dry humping?

1704
01:37:36,977 --> 01:37:39,309
- No.
- Sorry.

1705
01:37:39,479 --> 01:37:42,073
- But I didn't-
- I don't care if you didn't finish. Get off.

1706
01:37:42,249 --> 01:37:44,080
Mommy? Are you okay?

1707
01:37:44,251 --> 01:37:45,650
Maya, statue!
