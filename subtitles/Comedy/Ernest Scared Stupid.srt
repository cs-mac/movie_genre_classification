1
00:02:34,836 --> 00:02:37,100
Ahhhhh!

2
00:02:39,841 --> 00:02:44,869
Ahhh! Ahhh! Ahhhh!

3
00:02:49,484 --> 00:02:53,011
Ahhhh! Ahhh!

4
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:58,690
Ahhh! Ahhhhh!

5
00:03:01,796 --> 00:03:03,229
Ahhhhhh!

6
00:03:03,297 --> 00:03:05,663
<i>Grab him!
Grab him, Judas! Take him!</i>

7
00:03:05,733 --> 00:03:08,031
We got the monster that wants
to hack up our children.

8
00:03:08,102 --> 00:03:10,070
<i>Get the chains on him.</i>

9
00:03:10,137 --> 00:03:12,071
I got him.

10
00:03:12,139 --> 00:03:16,303
<i>The ancient evil has
followed us here to this new world.</i>

11
00:03:16,377 --> 00:03:18,675
<i>He has stolen our children</i>

12
00:03:18,746 --> 00:03:21,977
<i>and tried to resurrect
his wicked race.</i>

13
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:25,951
<i>But we, in our righteousness,
have prevailed.</i>

14
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:29,114
My babies-- he took my babies!

15
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,454
And here he shall be buried,

16
00:03:31,526 --> 00:03:34,893
and this oak tree
will seal his fate.

17
00:03:34,962 --> 00:03:41,424
Its roots will be his prison,
which must never be disturbed.

18
00:03:41,502 --> 00:03:43,800
Hear me, Phineas Worrell.

19
00:03:43,871 --> 00:03:46,339
<i>When the face of death
covers the moon,</i>

20
00:03:46,407 --> 00:03:50,605
<i>one with your blood
in his veins will release me,</i>

21
00:03:50,678 --> 00:03:53,408
<i>and victory will at last
be mine!</i>

22
00:03:54,715 --> 00:03:56,649
There, there, Francis.

23
00:03:56,717 --> 00:03:59,515
We'll get them back.
You'll see.

24
00:03:59,587 --> 00:04:02,852
I banish you
to eternal darkness.

25
00:04:04,926 --> 00:04:07,622
<i>"So in the hours
just before midnight,</i>

26
00:04:07,695 --> 00:04:10,687
<i>"the people of Briarville
buried Trantor the Troll</i>

27
00:04:10,765 --> 00:04:14,531
"in the cold, damp ground.

28
00:04:14,602 --> 00:04:15,864
The end."

29
00:04:15,937 --> 00:04:17,268
Thank you, Elizabeth.

30
00:04:17,338 --> 00:04:20,000
Class, what did you think
of her report?

31
00:04:20,074 --> 00:04:21,166
That's bull!

32
00:04:21,242 --> 00:04:22,436
<i>It's not bull!</i>

33
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,341
I read it in a book.

34
00:04:24,412 --> 00:04:25,674
Yeah, it was a cool report.

35
00:04:25,746 --> 00:04:27,304
It probably just went over
your head.

36
00:04:27,381 --> 00:04:29,906
The reports were supposed to
be on the history of the town,

37
00:04:29,984 --> 00:04:31,474
not "Nightmare
on Troll Street."

38
00:04:32,553 --> 00:04:34,544
Now, settle down, class.

39
00:04:34,622 --> 00:04:35,850
Lay off her, Murdock.

40
00:04:35,923 --> 00:04:37,390
What are you gonna do
about it, runt?

41
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:41,053
Elizabeth scared Kenny
with a spooky story.

42
00:04:41,128 --> 00:04:42,789
The dork likes her.

43
00:04:42,863 --> 00:04:46,060
<i>Although Elizabeth's report was
a bit unusual,</i>

44
00:04:46,133 --> 00:04:49,068
legends and myths are
a real part of history,

45
00:04:49,136 --> 00:04:52,799
especially here in Briarville,
with our unique past.

46
00:04:52,873 --> 00:04:54,500
<i>I think it was a clever idea.</i>

47
00:04:54,575 --> 00:04:55,507
<i>Ernest!</i>

48
00:04:55,576 --> 00:04:58,807
<i>Ernest!
Stop the truck!</i>

49
00:05:00,548 --> 00:05:02,948
So, uh, Elizabeth,

50
00:05:03,017 --> 00:05:05,815
what was the curse
the troll put on Phineas?

51
00:05:05,886 --> 00:05:09,515
Well, legend has it
that from that moment on,

52
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:15,551
Phineas' descendants would
get dumber and dumber...

53
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:18,098
<i>and dumber.</i>

54
00:05:22,103 --> 00:05:25,038
Yeah, when they hired me
as sanitary engineer,

55
00:05:25,106 --> 00:05:29,167
they had no idea that I was
actually Ernest P. Worrell,

56
00:05:29,243 --> 00:05:32,235
man of destiny,
ruler of refuse,

57
00:05:32,313 --> 00:05:35,510
a man who has taken dominion
over his environment...

58
00:05:36,584 --> 00:05:38,074
<i>... a brilliant innovator</i>

59
00:05:38,152 --> 00:05:40,712
<i>in the fertile field
of recycling.</i>

60
00:05:40,788 --> 00:05:43,416
The czar of jars,
the baron of bottles,

61
00:05:43,491 --> 00:05:45,356
the duke of dust--

62
00:05:48,663 --> 00:05:49,595
Oh, no!

63
00:05:49,664 --> 00:05:51,632
Uh, the switch is on the fritz!

64
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:54,429
<i>Uh, Rimshot! Rimshot!
A little help here, Rimshot!</i>

65
00:05:54,502 --> 00:05:56,697
Rimshot!
Rimshot, the clutch!

66
00:05:57,972 --> 00:06:00,270
Rimshot, the clutch!
The clutch!

67
00:06:01,976 --> 00:06:03,603
The clutch, Rimshot!

68
00:06:03,678 --> 00:06:04,872
Help!

69
00:06:04,945 --> 00:06:06,537
<i>Rimshot, the clutch!</i>

70
00:06:08,816 --> 00:06:10,613
<i>Rimshot! Whoa!</i>

71
00:06:10,685 --> 00:06:11,674
Wa-aaaah!

72
00:06:16,991 --> 00:06:18,959
Ahh.

73
00:06:21,128 --> 00:06:22,561
That was close.

74
00:06:26,667 --> 00:06:30,501
Oh...

75
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,403
<i>I'm gonna be squooshed!</i>

76
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:05,864
<i>Rimshot, help!
Do something! Rimshot!</i>

77
00:07:07,374 --> 00:07:09,535
Aah! Aah!

78
00:07:11,946 --> 00:07:15,074
<i>No, no!
Don't stick my head in those gears!</i>

79
00:07:15,149 --> 00:07:16,980
But i-it's me or you!

80
00:07:17,051 --> 00:07:20,043
But I have
a family at the doll factory!

81
00:07:20,121 --> 00:07:22,180
I'll send them a nice card.

82
00:07:22,256 --> 00:07:25,589
You'll never get away
with this, Ernest! I know where you live!

83
00:07:46,013 --> 00:07:47,776
Ah heh heh heh heh heh.

84
00:07:50,785 --> 00:07:52,218
Wa-ahhhh!

85
00:07:54,321 --> 00:07:56,755
Those Murdocks are
major jerks.

86
00:07:56,824 --> 00:07:59,349
If their IQ's were any lower,
they'd be plants.

87
00:08:01,962 --> 00:08:04,430
Rimshot!
Something's wrong!

88
00:08:04,498 --> 00:08:06,830
<i>Help! Let me out of here!</i>

89
00:08:08,102 --> 00:08:09,865
Ernest!

90
00:08:11,605 --> 00:08:13,095
This should open it.

91
00:08:14,842 --> 00:08:16,776
Way to go!
You did it!

92
00:08:16,844 --> 00:08:19,870
Well, no
need to thank me, little lady.

93
00:08:19,947 --> 00:08:21,710
Just some
routine hero work.

94
00:08:26,453 --> 00:08:27,385
Aahhh!

95
00:08:39,066 --> 00:08:42,832
Sheriff...

96
00:08:42,903 --> 00:08:45,929
I've just come
from the Hackmore place.

97
00:08:46,006 --> 00:08:47,268
It's an absolute mess.

98
00:08:47,341 --> 00:08:49,138
It violates every code
in the book.

99
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:51,770
I want it cleaned up, and I
want it cleaned up immediately.

100
00:08:51,846 --> 00:08:55,338
Yes. Well, mayor, I served the papers, and
Ernest said he would get right on it.

101
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:57,475
If he can't handle it,
you fire him.

102
00:08:57,551 --> 00:08:58,813
Yes, sir.

103
00:08:58,886 --> 00:09:00,877
There goes that idiot
now.

104
00:09:00,955 --> 00:09:04,391
<i>Ha. And he's going away
from the Hackmore place.</i>

105
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:06,722
That was close.

106
00:09:06,794 --> 00:09:10,753
Yeah, my dad said we can get
in big trouble riding in here.

107
00:09:10,831 --> 00:09:12,992
Well, it is against
city regulations and all,

108
00:09:13,067 --> 00:09:15,126
but as driver
of a garbage truck,

109
00:09:15,202 --> 00:09:17,363
I feel like captain
of my own ship,

110
00:09:17,438 --> 00:09:20,874
master of my own fate,
able to make my own rules,

111
00:09:20,941 --> 00:09:22,875
a man above the law.

112
00:09:26,013 --> 00:09:27,105
Uh-oh.

113
00:09:27,181 --> 00:09:29,479
It's my dad!

114
00:09:41,428 --> 00:09:42,986
Uh, was I speeding?

115
00:09:43,063 --> 00:09:46,157
Sometimes the raw power of this
vehicle just gets away from me--

116
00:09:46,233 --> 00:09:49,066
Ernest, I told you to get
out to the Hackmore place--

117
00:09:49,136 --> 00:09:50,068
Shh!

118
00:09:50,137 --> 00:09:51,502
You two--

119
00:09:51,572 --> 00:09:53,335
get out of there and
get in the car right now.

120
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,601
Dad, I--

121
00:09:54,675 --> 00:09:56,802
No, I don't want to hear it.
Get in the car.

122
00:09:56,877 --> 00:09:59,175
<i>It wasn't their fault.
I-I'm the captain, and-- </i>

123
00:09:59,246 --> 00:10:01,737
No, look, I told you to get
out to the Hackmore place

124
00:10:01,815 --> 00:10:03,806
and clean it up,
and you haven't done it.

125
00:10:03,884 --> 00:10:05,943
Well, uh, I don't have
a toxic-waste permit.

126
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:09,820
Uh, I just took a cold pill, and I'm not
supposed to operate heavy machinery.

127
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:12,484
<i>Look, if you want to
hang on to your job,</i>

128
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:14,789
you'll get out there
and do it.

129
00:10:14,862 --> 00:10:16,454
See you, Ernest.

130
00:10:46,894 --> 00:10:48,225
Come on, boy.

131
00:10:48,295 --> 00:10:50,559
We've nothing to fear
but fear itself,

132
00:10:50,631 --> 00:10:51,723
plus the known fact

133
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:53,733
that Old Lady Hackmore
will turn us into

134
00:10:53,801 --> 00:10:56,292
a couple of drooling,
red-eyed zombies

135
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:57,632
if she catches us here.

136
00:11:12,786 --> 00:11:14,219
Well, nobody home.

137
00:11:14,288 --> 00:11:16,085
I guess they're out
robbin' graves

138
00:11:16,156 --> 00:11:19,125
or bitin' the heads off chickens
or whatever's in voodoo vogue.

139
00:11:19,193 --> 00:11:21,923
Get off of my property!

140
00:11:21,996 --> 00:11:23,759
<i>What are you
doing here?!</i>

141
00:11:23,831 --> 00:11:26,527
Ma'am, I'm just here to
pick up all this garbage.

142
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,000
Got no garbage here,

143
00:11:29,069 --> 00:11:31,765
only the expressions
of the soul.

144
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,103
Uh, ma'am, I'm
an official representative

145
00:11:34,174 --> 00:11:36,108
of the Briarville
city government,

146
00:11:36,176 --> 00:11:38,838
<i>and, incidentally, a close personal
friend of Mayor Murdock's.</i>

147
00:11:38,912 --> 00:11:41,039
Aren't you
that Worrell kid?

148
00:11:41,115 --> 00:11:42,454
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

149
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:47,612
Oh... you will bring down
the curse on us all!

150
00:11:47,688 --> 00:11:50,350
Woe to you,
oh, ye seed of Worrell.

151
00:11:50,424 --> 00:11:52,483
Get out of here
and don't come back!

152
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:54,151
I wish you'd reconsider.

153
00:11:54,228 --> 00:11:57,026
Recycling is a... a very important
part of good citizenship.

154
00:11:57,097 --> 00:11:58,064
<i>Yeah.</i>

155
00:11:58,132 --> 00:12:00,066
And you'll be
a dead citizen.

156
00:12:00,134 --> 00:12:02,932
When the poisons of
the evil courses through

157
00:12:03,003 --> 00:12:05,471
the portals and channels
of your body,

158
00:12:05,539 --> 00:12:09,475
you will lie a quivering, toxic
mass of screaming flesh!

159
00:12:09,543 --> 00:12:10,976
They will have to load you

160
00:12:11,045 --> 00:12:13,138
and the rest
of this backward town

161
00:12:13,213 --> 00:12:15,579
on a meat wagon
with a pitchfork!

162
00:12:15,649 --> 00:12:17,480
So in other words,

163
00:12:17,551 --> 00:12:19,951
it might be better
if I came back another day.

164
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,453
Aahhhhh!

165
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:27,258
Ahhhhhhhh!

166
00:12:27,327 --> 00:12:29,261
Pretty scary scream,
huh?

167
00:12:29,329 --> 00:12:30,990
My heart
was in my throat.

168
00:12:31,065 --> 00:12:32,396
You have a rare gift.

169
00:12:32,466 --> 00:12:34,434
You haven't seen
the grand finale yet.

170
00:12:34,501 --> 00:12:35,433
Come here.

171
00:12:36,837 --> 00:12:39,431
See, they'll come in here
and go through that door

172
00:12:39,506 --> 00:12:42,532
<i>and up this way, where Joey hits
'em in the face with a mop.</i>

173
00:12:42,609 --> 00:12:44,099
<i>A wet mop.</i>

174
00:12:44,178 --> 00:12:46,738
Then they'll have to crawl
through all these peeled grapes

175
00:12:46,814 --> 00:12:48,873
while I'm screaming,
"Where are my eyes?

176
00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:50,439
Don't step on
my eyeballs!"

177
00:12:50,517 --> 00:12:52,508
Gross!
But I love it.

178
00:12:54,088 --> 00:12:55,521
It's the Murdocks!

179
00:12:55,589 --> 00:12:57,682
Look out, witch!
It's an earthquake!

180
00:12:57,758 --> 00:12:59,988
It's a big one--
5.3 on the Richter scale!

181
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,652
Quick!
Let's run out the back!

182
00:13:01,728 --> 00:13:03,628
It's caving in!
It's caving in!

183
00:13:03,697 --> 00:13:04,823
Get out!
You're gonna die!

184
00:13:04,898 --> 00:13:06,832
We're caving in!

185
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,061
Let's run for it!
Go! Go!

186
00:13:12,573 --> 00:13:15,565
You buttheads made
a big mistake!

187
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,377
Hey, where do you think
you're going?

188
00:13:21,448 --> 00:13:23,245
The fun's just beginning!

189
00:13:23,317 --> 00:13:26,411
<i>I don't know what to do.
They wrecked our haunted house.</i>

190
00:13:26,487 --> 00:13:29,285
They-- they wrecked
your haunted house?

191
00:13:29,356 --> 00:13:30,550
Yeah.

192
00:13:30,624 --> 00:13:32,251
You know, what you need
is some of that

193
00:13:32,326 --> 00:13:34,260
hysterical perspective,
know what I mean?

194
00:13:34,328 --> 00:13:36,660
Not... really.

195
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:39,563
You need to
learn a self-defense lesson

196
00:13:39,633 --> 00:13:41,863
from... tiny Botswana,
that...

197
00:13:41,935 --> 00:13:44,335
plucky little nation
that defeated the...

198
00:13:44,404 --> 00:13:46,531
giant Ottoman Empire.

199
00:13:48,142 --> 00:13:50,337
Ernest, what does that
have to do with me?

200
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:52,207
I'm glad you asked.

201
00:13:54,748 --> 00:13:57,182
It was a dark
night in lower Botswana.

202
00:13:57,251 --> 00:14:00,186
Giant bula bula flies droned
in the still air.

203
00:14:00,254 --> 00:14:01,380
Then it came--

204
00:14:01,455 --> 00:14:04,253
the screeching war cry
of the Ottoman hordes.

205
00:14:04,324 --> 00:14:06,019
Wa-aah!

206
00:14:06,093 --> 00:14:08,618
We're the Ottomans,
and you're not!

207
00:14:08,695 --> 00:14:11,095
You're in a world of it now,
pal!

208
00:14:11,165 --> 00:14:13,429
Oh, my. I'm afraid.

209
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,592
Sure, I'm scared.

210
00:14:14,668 --> 00:14:16,863
E-everybody in Botswana's
scared.

211
00:14:16,937 --> 00:14:18,370
It looks like curtains.

212
00:14:18,438 --> 00:14:21,202
This place is just screaming
for drapes.

213
00:14:21,275 --> 00:14:24,472
Don't worry about the Ottomans.
They're just wussies.

214
00:14:24,545 --> 00:14:25,477
They're all talk.

215
00:14:25,546 --> 00:14:28,106
I knew an Ottoman eagle scout.

216
00:14:28,182 --> 00:14:30,912
He got a merit badge
in wholesale slaughter.

217
00:14:30,984 --> 00:14:32,281
Aah!

218
00:14:32,352 --> 00:14:34,217
Come on, Ottomans!
Take a piece of me!

219
00:14:35,455 --> 00:14:38,322
What we need... is
the high ground.

220
00:14:38,392 --> 00:14:41,088
The high ground is no good
without trees.

221
00:14:41,161 --> 00:14:45,427
Friends, Romans, Botswanians,
lend me your tree.

222
00:14:45,499 --> 00:14:47,091
There ain't no trees
in Botswana.

223
00:14:47,167 --> 00:14:48,759
Unh-unh. I know.

224
00:14:48,835 --> 00:14:51,770
I am a Botswanian lumberjack,
and I ain't never had a job.

225
00:14:51,838 --> 00:14:53,635
We need dress shields.

226
00:14:53,707 --> 00:14:56,471
You need the high ground
to keep away from us

227
00:14:56,543 --> 00:14:59,068
'cause...
'Cause we're the Ottomans!

228
00:14:59,146 --> 00:15:01,080
Aah!

229
00:15:01,148 --> 00:15:04,208
Ernest, I know! I know!
What we need is...

230
00:15:04,284 --> 00:15:05,774
a treehouse!

231
00:15:05,852 --> 00:15:08,650
I thought we needed
dress shields.

232
00:15:17,764 --> 00:15:19,527
Ernest!

233
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,296
Direct hit.
Way to go, Ernest.

234
00:15:22,369 --> 00:15:24,200
Do you smell fish?

235
00:15:25,806 --> 00:15:27,831
The first step
in treehouse construction,

236
00:15:27,908 --> 00:15:29,671
which I'll refer to
as "step one,"

237
00:15:29,743 --> 00:15:31,176
is tree selection.

238
00:15:31,245 --> 00:15:32,678
With the right tree,

239
00:15:32,746 --> 00:15:35,180
we can build
an impregnant fortress

240
00:15:35,249 --> 00:15:38,343
armed with nuclear rays,
disintegrator beams,

241
00:15:38,418 --> 00:15:41,012
and all the latest
electronic technology

242
00:15:41,088 --> 00:15:44,489
to afford us a safe haven
against advancing hordes

243
00:15:44,558 --> 00:15:48,085
as well as offering
truly elegant country living

244
00:15:48,161 --> 00:15:50,356
in rustic surroundings.

245
00:15:53,867 --> 00:15:56,335
Nah.
Too much bass.

246
00:15:58,071 --> 00:15:59,333
This one's nice.

247
00:16:01,742 --> 00:16:03,710
Ah heh. Too many
termites. Ah heh.

248
00:16:03,777 --> 00:16:05,210
This looks like
a good one.

249
00:16:07,948 --> 00:16:09,040
Inhabited.

250
00:16:09,116 --> 00:16:11,050
Oh, jeez.

251
00:16:11,118 --> 00:16:14,713
What's the big idea?
A tree is a tree.

252
00:16:14,788 --> 00:16:17,951
We've got to find one big enough
to keep the Ottomans out.

253
00:16:18,025 --> 00:16:19,287
The Ottomans?

254
00:16:19,359 --> 00:16:20,621
Don't ask.

255
00:16:20,694 --> 00:16:25,529
<i>Oo-o-o-o-o-o-h!</i>

256
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,692
This is neat!

257
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,140
Go on!

258
00:16:43,317 --> 00:16:46,753
It's okay.
Go on!

259
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:49,448
Go on!

260
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:54,351
I don't like this.

261
00:16:54,428 --> 00:16:57,022
Well, I didn't see
any poison ivy.

262
00:16:57,097 --> 00:16:58,689
The worst thing
that could happen

263
00:16:58,765 --> 00:17:01,359
would be Dutch elm blight,
and none of us are Dutch.

264
00:17:10,677 --> 00:17:14,306
Remember, if any of us
get separated,

265
00:17:14,381 --> 00:17:17,282
there's an old pioneer way
of finding north--

266
00:17:17,351 --> 00:17:21,617
the bark always grows
on the outside of a tree.

267
00:17:21,688 --> 00:17:23,315
<i>Is he serious?</i>

268
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:25,551
<i>I'm afraid so.</i>

269
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,388
<i>This is it!</i>

270
00:17:27,461 --> 00:17:30,328
The foundation
of the high ground--

271
00:17:30,397 --> 00:17:31,796
tree of the stars!

272
00:17:31,865 --> 00:17:34,299
This is a tree
to die for.

273
00:17:38,038 --> 00:17:40,268
<i>Come on, kids.
This'll be fun.</i>

274
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:43,104
<i>I've been collecting
this stuff for years.</i>

275
00:17:43,176 --> 00:17:46,270
Well, I guess we got to
give it a try.

276
00:17:46,346 --> 00:17:48,177
No guts, no glory.

277
00:17:52,052 --> 00:17:57,615
Yes, just as the journey of 1,000
miles begins with a single step,

278
00:17:57,691 --> 00:18:00,785
a treehouse begins
with a single nail.

279
00:18:00,861 --> 00:18:02,123
Observe.

280
00:18:07,534 --> 00:18:10,594
<i>Here he shall be buried,</i>

281
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:14,197
<i>and this oak tree will seal
his fate.</i>

282
00:18:14,274 --> 00:18:17,869
<i>Its roots will be his prison,</i>

283
00:18:17,944 --> 00:18:21,209
<i>which must never be disturbed.</i>

284
00:18:22,482 --> 00:18:26,145
<i>Return this evil
from whence it came.</i>

285
00:18:31,725 --> 00:18:34,489
Ahhhhh!

286
00:18:46,573 --> 00:18:49,201
One treehouse--
under construction.

287
00:18:49,276 --> 00:18:50,573
<i>Crank 'er up.</i>

288
00:18:51,912 --> 00:18:55,177
<i>All right.
This is really working.</i>

289
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,514
<i>This is great!</i>

290
00:19:08,795 --> 00:19:11,195
<i>All right, Joey.
Over here.</i>

291
00:19:13,066 --> 00:19:15,227
<i>- Another wall coming up.
- Good work.</i>

292
00:19:15,302 --> 00:19:18,032
<i>One more side to go.</i>

293
00:19:18,104 --> 00:19:20,265
This is really looking
great.

294
00:19:23,009 --> 00:19:26,410
The spirits are loose again.
Who would dare enter here?

295
00:19:28,114 --> 00:19:29,604
- All right! We did it!
- Yeah!

296
00:19:29,683 --> 00:19:31,207
This is really neat.

297
00:19:31,284 --> 00:19:33,149
This is your high ground.

298
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,381
<i>I felt it! I felt it!</i>

299
00:19:35,455 --> 00:19:36,888
<i>Heaven help us!</i>

300
00:19:36,957 --> 00:19:38,788
<i>The signs showed me-- </i>

301
00:19:38,859 --> 00:19:41,623
<i>the sun,
the moon, the stars-- </i>

302
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:44,425
oh, horror will once more
walk among us.

303
00:19:44,498 --> 00:19:46,966
The nightmare will begin
again.

304
00:19:48,935 --> 00:19:51,199
Well, it's not the greatest
treehouse in the world,

305
00:19:51,271 --> 00:19:53,136
but I wouldn't call it
a nightmare, either.

306
00:19:53,206 --> 00:19:54,639
Worrell!

307
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:57,302
What have you done?!
What have you done to the tree?

308
00:19:57,377 --> 00:20:01,211
A whole world of trees,
and you had to pick this one!

309
00:20:01,281 --> 00:20:04,717
Well, we didn't know this was your land,
or we would've asked if it was okay.

310
00:20:04,784 --> 00:20:09,050
It will open the ancient door
and all that lurks inside!

311
00:20:09,122 --> 00:20:10,384
Flee this evil place!

312
00:20:10,457 --> 00:20:12,152
Flee!

313
00:20:12,225 --> 00:20:13,658
<i>Old Lady Hackmore!</i>

314
00:20:13,727 --> 00:20:16,787
Wow! I thought she never
went out of her house.

315
00:20:16,863 --> 00:20:19,263
Probably some simple
misunderstanding.

316
00:20:19,332 --> 00:20:21,926
Maybe I should go
and have a talk with her.

317
00:20:25,005 --> 00:20:26,529
They will return...

318
00:20:26,606 --> 00:20:28,233
<i>Well, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.</i>

319
00:20:28,308 --> 00:20:30,640
<i>We're not really on your place,
more like above it.</i>

320
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:33,144
- Couldn't we talk air rights?
- Get away. Get away.

321
00:20:34,381 --> 00:20:37,145
- That was spooky.
- Yeah.

322
00:20:37,217 --> 00:20:40,277
Come on. I think
they went this way.

323
00:20:40,353 --> 00:20:42,844
Yeah. They got to be
around here somewhere.

324
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:46,448
It's the Murdocks!

325
00:20:46,526 --> 00:20:48,118
All right.
Battle stations.

326
00:20:48,194 --> 00:20:50,924
Let's see how this baby works
under actual field conditions!

327
00:20:50,997 --> 00:20:51,929
Let's go!

328
00:20:51,998 --> 00:20:53,989
Time to get even.

329
00:20:54,067 --> 00:20:56,535
Tearing up this place
will be major fun.

330
00:20:56,603 --> 00:20:58,594
Yeah. I wonder
where the wimps are.

331
00:21:00,006 --> 00:21:01,564
- Get down!
- Watch this!

332
00:21:06,713 --> 00:21:09,181
I've got 'em in my sights...

333
00:21:09,249 --> 00:21:10,978
lock and load...

334
00:21:11,051 --> 00:21:13,019
and... fire.

335
00:21:13,086 --> 00:21:14,417
Aah!

336
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:18,352
Load me up.

337
00:21:18,425 --> 00:21:20,620
Ammunition coming in--
pepperoni and cheese.

338
00:21:20,694 --> 00:21:23,185
<i>More ammo, Rimshot.
Good boy!</i>

339
00:21:23,263 --> 00:21:24,525
Let's go!

340
00:21:26,433 --> 00:21:27,365
Fire.

341
00:21:29,069 --> 00:21:31,264
Fire three! Got him!

342
00:21:31,338 --> 00:21:32,930
Bingo!

343
00:21:33,006 --> 00:21:34,132
Chicken liver comin' up.

344
00:21:34,207 --> 00:21:35,765
Now!

345
00:21:35,842 --> 00:21:36,774
<i>Way to go, Joey!</i>

346
00:21:36,843 --> 00:21:37,867
Ugh!

347
00:21:37,944 --> 00:21:39,343
<i>That's delivery, boys!</i>

348
00:21:39,412 --> 00:21:41,312
Aah!

349
00:21:41,381 --> 00:21:42,313
Aah!

350
00:21:42,382 --> 00:21:43,508
Direct hit!

351
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:45,551
Ew! A pizza mess!

352
00:21:45,619 --> 00:21:48,679
Binder, this isn't
the end of this!

353
00:21:50,624 --> 00:21:51,613
Yeah.

354
00:21:51,691 --> 00:21:53,124
They're on the run!

355
00:21:53,193 --> 00:21:54,956
And no collateral damage,
either.

356
00:21:55,028 --> 00:21:56,586
All right!
That was great!

357
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:04,562
Halt! Who goes there?

358
00:22:04,638 --> 00:22:06,833
Uh, don't shoot.
Don't shoot.

359
00:22:06,906 --> 00:22:08,203
I'm on your side.

360
00:22:08,274 --> 00:22:10,970
Sorry, Ernest. I guess
we're still a little bit jumpy.

361
00:22:11,044 --> 00:22:12,477
<i>Guess what happened.</i>

362
00:22:12,545 --> 00:22:14,012
The Murdocks came by.

363
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,344
But they never had
a chance.

364
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:18,816
Yeah, and the Botswanians
kicked butt.

365
00:22:18,885 --> 00:22:20,284
Told you.

366
00:22:20,353 --> 00:22:23,811
Hey, Ernest, what was
Mrs. Hackmore going on about?

367
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:26,882
Oh, she still believes in
trolls and magic spells

368
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,393
and things like that.

369
00:22:28,461 --> 00:22:31,396
Trolls? Like hide under bridges
and eat little girls?

370
00:22:31,464 --> 00:22:33,091
Cut it out, dork.

371
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:35,396
It's like the legend
of Trantor.

372
00:22:35,468 --> 00:22:37,095
Elizabeth, get a life.

373
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:39,001
Just because you write
a report about it

374
00:22:39,072 --> 00:22:40,903
doesn't mean it comes true.

375
00:22:40,974 --> 00:22:44,375
She told me about this troll
that had red, glowing eyes

376
00:22:44,444 --> 00:22:46,036
and walks like this.

377
00:22:49,349 --> 00:22:50,782
And if he ever gets loose,

378
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:53,114
he'll go after
the children first.

379
00:22:53,186 --> 00:22:56,280
And he turns them into
little wooden dolls,

380
00:22:56,356 --> 00:22:58,449
which gives him his power.

381
00:22:58,525 --> 00:23:03,485
And that ugly little rascal
is still alive...

382
00:23:03,563 --> 00:23:05,997
down there.

383
00:23:06,066 --> 00:23:07,328
But...

384
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,924
He can
only be awakened

385
00:23:09,002 --> 00:23:11,470
on the night
before Halloween...

386
00:23:11,538 --> 00:23:13,403
Like tonight.

387
00:23:13,473 --> 00:23:14,872
... when a Worrell...

388
00:23:14,941 --> 00:23:16,704
Like you.

389
00:23:17,777 --> 00:23:22,680
... places his hand on a tree--
like this-- and says,

390
00:23:22,749 --> 00:23:27,618
"Yea, I call thee forth, Trantor."

391
00:23:30,356 --> 00:23:32,586
But what are the
chances of that happening?

392
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:57,839
Looks like some rain!

393
00:23:57,917 --> 00:23:59,077
Wouldn't be safe here!

394
00:23:59,152 --> 00:24:02,610
Uh, hey, wait a minute, fellas.
Wait. Hold on.

395
00:24:02,689 --> 00:24:04,054
Hey, guys, wait for me!

396
00:24:04,124 --> 00:24:05,421
Hurry, Elizabeth!
Hurry!

397
00:24:05,492 --> 00:24:06,618
Let's go!

398
00:24:06,693 --> 00:24:08,354
<i>Hey, everybody,
where are you going?</i>

399
00:24:08,428 --> 00:24:10,487
<i>Can't you see I'm up here
all... </i>

400
00:24:10,563 --> 00:24:12,428
Alone?

401
00:24:16,236 --> 00:24:17,828
Easy, Rimshot.

402
00:24:17,904 --> 00:24:19,735
Easy, boy.

403
00:24:19,806 --> 00:24:22,900
There's nothing to be afraid of.
After all, we've got the... high ground.

404
00:24:27,614 --> 00:24:30,344
Yeah.
Good suggestion, Rimshot.

405
00:24:30,416 --> 00:24:31,849
<i>Why didn't I think of that?</i>

406
00:24:31,918 --> 00:24:34,182
Why don't we go on home?
How 'bout it?

407
00:24:36,389 --> 00:24:39,222
Aah!

408
00:24:39,292 --> 00:24:41,317
Boy, I sure hope
you're from Keebler!

409
00:24:44,197 --> 00:24:46,597
You better back off!
You don't want to fight me!

410
00:24:46,666 --> 00:24:48,600
I know tai chi, kung fu,
Shao-lin.

411
00:24:48,668 --> 00:24:51,296
I saw Hulkamania
three times, once in slow-mo!

412
00:24:53,239 --> 00:24:54,638
Back off!
Oh, don't kill me!

413
00:24:54,707 --> 00:24:56,368
Don't kill me!
I don't want to die!

414
00:25:11,791 --> 00:25:13,850
All right.
Civilization.

415
00:25:13,927 --> 00:25:17,419
See you, guys. I'm already late,
and my mom's gonna kill me.

416
00:25:17,497 --> 00:25:19,465
Yeah. Yeah,
I'm out of here, too.

417
00:25:19,532 --> 00:25:22,126
Later, dudes.
See y'all tomorrow.

418
00:25:59,372 --> 00:26:00,805
Aah!

419
00:26:00,874 --> 00:26:03,502
Somebody help me!
Help-- anyone!

420
00:26:03,576 --> 00:26:05,373
Help!

421
00:26:05,445 --> 00:26:06,742
Somebody! Ernest!

422
00:26:06,813 --> 00:26:07,905
Help!

423
00:26:09,315 --> 00:26:11,613
Kenny! Elizabeth!
Where are you?

424
00:26:11,684 --> 00:26:14,152
Oh, no!
Oh, help! Come on!

425
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,154
<i>Hey, I got ya.</i>

426
00:26:16,222 --> 00:26:18,850
Thanks, Ernest. You saved me.

427
00:26:18,925 --> 00:26:20,324
I thought I was a goner.

428
00:26:20,393 --> 00:26:24,557
A-a-a-a-a-a-ah!

429
00:26:38,278 --> 00:26:39,210
Sheriff!

430
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,474
Sheriff Binder!

431
00:26:43,549 --> 00:26:45,915
Sheriff!

432
00:26:45,985 --> 00:26:47,782
Sheriff Binder! Open up!

433
00:26:47,854 --> 00:26:50,084
Aah!
Sheriff Binder, open up, please!

434
00:26:50,156 --> 00:26:51,088
Help!

435
00:26:51,157 --> 00:26:52,749
It was a monster!
It was awful!

436
00:26:52,825 --> 00:26:54,349
The tree and the lightning
and--

437
00:26:54,427 --> 00:26:56,952
and it had great, big teeth
and things on its ears like this

438
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:59,624
and its head was at least
this big and about this long--

439
00:26:59,699 --> 00:27:02,133
<i>Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Ernest, slow down. What happened?</i>

440
00:27:02,201 --> 00:27:03,828
Ernest, do you know
what time it is?

441
00:27:03,903 --> 00:27:06,565
<i>Maybe Old Lady Hackmore was
right-- maybe it was a troll!</i>

442
00:27:06,639 --> 00:27:09,267
Luckily, I was there to beat it
within an inch of its face--

443
00:27:09,342 --> 00:27:11,401
Hold it.
Old Lady Hackmore?

444
00:27:11,477 --> 00:27:14,446
Yeah, the kids and I built a treehouse
out there, and she got real steamed--

445
00:27:14,514 --> 00:27:16,243
You took Kenny and the kids
out there,

446
00:27:16,316 --> 00:27:17,943
trespassing
on that old lady's land?

447
00:27:18,017 --> 00:27:19,314
Yeah, but what happened?

448
00:27:19,385 --> 00:27:21,512
Sheriff, I saw a troll!
I really saw a troll!

449
00:27:21,587 --> 00:27:24,784
Dad, something really strange was
happening in those woods tonight.

450
00:27:24,857 --> 00:27:26,950
Yeah, you got to
believe me, sheriff!

451
00:27:27,026 --> 00:27:30,325
Yeah, look, Ernest, whoa.
Listen, you just had a nightmare, okay?

452
00:27:30,396 --> 00:27:31,556
- So pinch yourself...
- Ow!

453
00:27:31,631 --> 00:27:33,292
... and go on home--

454
00:27:33,366 --> 00:27:35,231
No, I'm not dreaming. This isn't a
nightmare. That really hurt.

455
00:27:35,301 --> 00:27:37,132
- We'll talk about it tomorrow.
- This thing was huge!

456
00:27:37,203 --> 00:27:38,534
It had this great,
big head--

457
00:27:38,604 --> 00:27:39,764
Good night, Ernest.

458
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:41,204
It was probably just--

459
00:27:41,274 --> 00:27:43,265
well, it was more about--
it was about this tall,

460
00:27:43,343 --> 00:27:45,402
and it looked like a giant,
big Mr. Potato Head,

461
00:27:45,478 --> 00:27:46,877
only as big
as a watermelon...

462
00:28:15,975 --> 00:28:20,173
<i>Grow, my children, grow.</i>

463
00:28:27,453 --> 00:28:29,478
<i>Oh, Miss Hackmore!</i>

464
00:28:29,555 --> 00:28:31,580
<i>Miss Hackmore!</i>

465
00:28:31,657 --> 00:28:32,885
I'm sorry to bother you.

466
00:28:32,959 --> 00:28:34,893
You have bothered
the whole planet.

467
00:28:34,961 --> 00:28:37,429
You're cursed, now you're
rubbing it off on me.

468
00:28:37,497 --> 00:28:38,862
But it's about
what you said.

469
00:28:38,931 --> 00:28:41,422
I...
I let the troll out.

470
00:28:41,501 --> 00:28:42,763
Uh...

471
00:28:42,835 --> 00:28:45,531
That which has been promised
is delivered.

472
00:28:45,605 --> 00:28:47,232
I-It was huge!

473
00:28:47,306 --> 00:28:50,207
It had a great, big head and
little, tiny, beady eyes,

474
00:28:50,276 --> 00:28:51,903
and great, big noses!

475
00:28:51,978 --> 00:28:54,276
They were...
it was horrible!

476
00:28:54,347 --> 00:28:58,078
You haven't seen horrible till you
see what it does to the children.

477
00:28:58,151 --> 00:29:00,051
Heaven help us.

478
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:02,280
Them that dies will be
the lucky ones!

479
00:29:02,355 --> 00:29:03,344
Oh!

480
00:29:05,391 --> 00:29:07,916
I felt it!
Heaven, help us.

483
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:22,104
<i>Well...
I can handle that.</i>

484
00:29:22,175 --> 00:29:26,441
<i>A few crucifixes,
a little garlic... </i>

485
00:29:26,512 --> 00:29:28,639
perhaps a silver bullet.

00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:32,577
<i>Ahhh.</i>

487
00:29:32,652 --> 00:29:36,520
<i>Ghouls, zombies... </i>

488
00:29:36,589 --> 00:29:37,920
<i>Ahhh.</i>

489
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:41,118
<i>It has been
my lifelong wish</i>

490
00:29:41,194 --> 00:29:43,754
that this book
would never be opened,

491
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:46,628
but, of course,
you've changed all that.

492
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:53,664

This is not a drill!

An actual troll

What's Ernest

527
00:31:27,667 --> 00:31:30,033
Something stupid
about trolls.

528
00:31:30,102 --> 00:31:33,162
Make sure your shoes
are on the right feet

Are you ready?
Roll 'em.

539
00:31:59,398 --> 00:32:00,729
Hello, friends,
this is Tom Tulip

540
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,324
with Tulip Brothers'
One-Stop Salvage.

541
00:32:02,401 --> 00:32:04,028
This is my big brother,
Bobby.

542
00:32:04,103 --> 00:32:05,934
A fella comes in here the
other day, and he says to me,

543
00:32:06,005 --> 00:32:07,563
"Will Tulip Brothers
give me a good deal

544
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:11,269
on an outboard motor
and some taxidermy supplies?"

545
00:32:11,344 --> 00:32:14,745
And I said, "Does
a fat puppy hate fast cars?"

546
00:32:16,015 --> 00:32:17,277
And then he says to me,

547
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:19,181
"Well, will you give me
a good deal

548
00:32:19,252 --> 00:32:21,311
"on some surplus government
canned goods

549
00:32:21,387 --> 00:32:23,014
and assorted socket
wrenches?"

550
00:32:23,089 --> 00:32:25,751
And I said, "Does a one-legged
duck swim in a circle?"

551
00:32:27,093 --> 00:32:28,754
But, no,
seriously, folks--

552
00:32:28,828 --> 00:32:30,090
Tom, you got to help me!

553
00:32:30,162 --> 00:32:32,289
There's a troll
on the loose, a troll!

554
00:32:32,365 --> 00:32:34,196
Ernest, Ernest!
Cut, Bobby, cut!

555
00:32:34,267 --> 00:32:36,963
<i>Can't you see we are engaged
in mass communication here?</i>

556
00:32:37,036 --> 00:32:39,004
But I got serious
problems-- trolls!

557
00:32:39,071 --> 00:32:41,972
Oh, trolls! Bobby, our friend
Ernest is seeing trolls.

558
00:32:42,041 --> 00:32:43,372
Trolls?

559
00:32:43,442 --> 00:32:44,773
Trolls.

560
00:32:44,844 --> 00:32:47,335
Oh, this is your lucky day,
but, of course, you knew

561
00:32:47,413 --> 00:32:48,937
that when I was stationed
in Germany

562
00:32:49,015 --> 00:32:50,448
with the 82nd airborne,

563
00:32:50,516 --> 00:32:53,417
I was in charge of
the troll-destruction unit.

564
00:32:53,486 --> 00:32:55,511
Have I got a deal for you.

565
00:32:55,588 --> 00:32:57,351
Huh ah-huh huh huh.

566
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,193
Sorry I'm late.
Isn't Joey here yet?

567
00:33:04,263 --> 00:33:06,663
No, Joey never got home
last night.

568
00:33:06,732 --> 00:33:08,495
What do you mean?

569
00:33:08,567 --> 00:33:12,128
You said Ernest came by our house
last night yelling about trolls.

570
00:33:12,204 --> 00:33:14,502
Do you think maybe--

571
00:33:14,573 --> 00:33:16,973
Come on, there's
no such thing as trolls.

572
00:33:17,043 --> 00:33:19,603
But Ernest saw something
out at the tree,

573
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,840
and he's never lied
to us before.

574
00:33:21,914 --> 00:33:24,849
Yeah, but trolls? Come on,
let's go check out the treehouse.

575
00:33:24,917 --> 00:33:26,179
Maybe Joey's there already.

576
00:33:26,252 --> 00:33:27,685
I don't know.

577
00:33:27,753 --> 00:33:30,017
You're not scared,
are you?

was a little wooden dolly.

638
00:36:35,674 --> 00:36:36,732
Ohh.

639
00:36:38,677 --> 00:36:41,805
The troll
is getting stronger.

640
00:36:41,881 --> 00:36:44,611
He has one child
already.

641
00:36:44,683 --> 00:36:49,120
By now, the tree is sprouting
its cursed pods.

642
00:36:49,188 --> 00:36:50,120
Pods?

643
00:36:50,189 --> 00:36:51,417
Pods!

644
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:54,323
And if they touch the ground,
all is lost!

645
00:36:54,393 --> 00:36:55,985
He needs four more souls

646
00:36:56,061 --> 00:36:58,188
before he can release
his army

647
00:36:58,264 --> 00:36:59,629
and start to capture

648
00:36:59,698 --> 00:37:01,962
the children
all over the world.

649
00:37:02,034 --> 00:37:03,592
Just the kids?

650
00:37:03,669 --> 00:37:06,763
Listen to the last two lines
of the troll's poem.

651
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:09,706
"There's one who can stop us
if he will dare,

652
00:37:09,775 --> 00:37:12,767
with the heart of a child
and a mother's care."

653
00:37:14,013 --> 00:37:15,913
<i>So... </i>

654
00:37:15,981 --> 00:37:17,676
we need a heart...

655
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:19,308
a child's heart!

656
00:37:26,425 --> 00:37:30,020
You wouldn't really sacrifice
someone, would you, Ernest?

657
00:37:30,095 --> 00:37:31,756
Yeah,
that was pretty crazy.

658
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:36,267
Well, human sacrifice would
definitely be a last resort.

659
00:37:36,335 --> 00:37:38,929
<i>Now, traps
is where it's at.</i>

660
00:37:39,004 --> 00:37:41,939
You see, Mr. Big, Bad,
Short, and Ugly

661
00:37:42,007 --> 00:37:45,465
will probably come strolling
through the woods

662
00:37:45,544 --> 00:37:49,378
saying something like,
"Oh, I sure could use a rest,

663
00:37:49,448 --> 00:37:52,110
"maybe catch a movie
on the cable.

664
00:37:52,184 --> 00:37:55,312
Think I'll check in
to this troll motel."

665
00:37:56,855 --> 00:37:58,618
And then we got him.

666
00:37:58,691 --> 00:38:00,056
And with this alarm system,

667
00:38:00,125 --> 00:38:02,184
the minute something steps
in our trap,

668
00:38:02,261 --> 00:38:03,523
the beeper will go off.

669
00:38:03,596 --> 00:38:06,121
<i>And endo trollo,
comprendo?</i>

670
00:38:18,243 --> 00:38:21,371
Aaaaaaah!

671
00:38:21,447 --> 00:38:23,381
Ahhhhhh!

672
00:38:24,917 --> 00:38:27,181
<i>Come on, I'll walk you
to your house.</i>

673
00:38:27,252 --> 00:38:31,586
<i>Hurry up, Kenny,
we got work to do.</i>

674
00:38:31,657 --> 00:38:34,649
I still don't see why I
can't go with you guys.

675
00:38:34,727 --> 00:38:36,957
Just leave
the troll fighting to us.

676
00:38:37,029 --> 00:38:39,463
I'll find my dad.
He'll know what to do.

677
00:38:39,531 --> 00:38:41,795
What about the party?

678
00:38:41,867 --> 00:38:43,858
You stay here tonight.

679
00:38:53,912 --> 00:38:57,143
<i>Another soul.</i>

680
00:39:00,619 --> 00:39:04,248
<i>Feed and grow strong,
my little ones.</i>

681
00:39:05,724 --> 00:39:08,215
<i>Thanks
for the ride home, Ernest.</i>

682
00:39:08,293 --> 00:39:09,590
Okay, here's the plan--

683
00:39:09,662 --> 00:39:11,527
Troll Fighter One--
that's me--

684
00:39:11,597 --> 00:39:13,861
will be roaming
the streets of Briarville

685
00:39:13,932 --> 00:39:15,832
like a rabid dog --
no offense--

686
00:39:15,901 --> 00:39:18,165
whilst Troll Fighter Two--
that's you--

687
00:39:18,237 --> 00:39:20,432
Um, Ernest, how about
I just get my dad

688
00:39:20,506 --> 00:39:21,871
and meet you at the tree?

689
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:23,464
Yeah, your dad
might get mad

690
00:39:23,542 --> 00:39:25,567
if we wrap this one up
all by ourselves.

691
00:40:14,827 --> 00:40:16,988
What's the matter, Kenny?

692
00:40:17,062 --> 00:40:18,791
Did a troll make you
wet your pants?

693
00:40:18,864 --> 00:40:20,161
You're such a wimp,
Binder.

694
00:40:30,309 --> 00:40:33,745
Kenny, what is going on?

695
00:40:33,812 --> 00:40:35,245
Nothing. I'm okay.

696
00:40:35,314 --> 00:40:36,576
Where's dad?

697
00:40:36,648 --> 00:40:37,979
<i>Where have you been?</i>

698
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:40,382
I-I was with Ernest
setting troll traps.

699
00:40:40,452 --> 00:40:43,114
Kenny, you have no business
being with Ernest.

700
00:40:43,188 --> 00:40:45,816
Mom, I got to find dad.
It's really important.

701
00:40:45,891 --> 00:40:47,984
Kenny-- Kenny,
you come back here!

702
00:40:50,829 --> 00:40:53,457
Bye-bye!
Happy Halloween!

703
00:40:53,532 --> 00:40:56,660
Be careful! Bye-bye!
Take care!

704
00:40:56,735 --> 00:40:59,363
<i>Honey, you hardly touched
your dinner tonight.</i>

705
00:40:59,438 --> 00:41:01,235
Now, this is just
Halloween.

706
00:41:01,306 --> 00:41:02,705
It's supposed to be fun,

707
00:41:02,775 --> 00:41:05,141
playing dress-up
and trick-or-treating.

708
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:08,077
But, mom, that little doll
looked just like Joey,

709
00:41:08,147 --> 00:41:09,409
and Ernest said--

710
00:41:09,481 --> 00:41:11,745
Honey, we have been
through all this.

711
00:41:11,817 --> 00:41:13,944
There are no such things
as trolls.

712
00:41:14,019 --> 00:41:16,146
<i>Uh, mom...
while you're in here,</i>

713
00:41:16,221 --> 00:41:18,155
could you check
under the bed?

714
00:41:18,223 --> 00:41:19,451
I thought I heard--

715
00:41:19,525 --> 00:41:21,686
Stop acting
like you're 2 years old.

716
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,352
<i>There is nothing
under the bed.</i>

717
00:41:23,428 --> 00:41:25,726
<i>Now, put on your costume
and come on downstairs.</i>

718
00:41:25,798 --> 00:41:28,062
We're all going over to
the Halloween party together.

719
00:41:28,133 --> 00:41:29,395
But, mom--

720
00:41:29,468 --> 00:41:31,732
Elizabeth,
don't be silly!

721
00:41:34,139 --> 00:41:36,505
There's nothing
under the bed.

722
00:41:36,575 --> 00:41:39,373
There's nothing
under the bed.

723
00:41:39,444 --> 00:41:42,311
There's nothing
under the bed.

724
00:42:07,272 --> 00:42:09,797
Oh, Snuffies...

725
00:42:09,875 --> 00:42:11,809
it's just you.

726
00:42:17,082 --> 00:42:19,744
<i>Aaaaaaah!</i>

727
00:42:23,222 --> 00:42:24,712
You know, Rimshot,

728
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:26,348
when it comes to
catching trolls,

729
00:42:26,425 --> 00:42:29,189
sometimes the old ways
are the good ways,

730
00:42:29,261 --> 00:42:30,421
know what I mean?

731
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:34,793
You disguised
as a yummy, little child,

732
00:42:34,867 --> 00:42:36,892
<i>will be the bait,</i>

733
00:42:36,969 --> 00:42:39,961
and this should put an end,
once and for all,

734
00:42:40,038 --> 00:42:41,801
to the beast of Briarville.

735
00:42:43,308 --> 00:42:46,971
You know, Rimshot...
you're a cute, little dog,

736
00:42:47,045 --> 00:42:49,570
but you are
one ugly little kid.

737
00:42:50,949 --> 00:42:54,112
Okay, Rimshot,
now, bring me the stick.

738
00:42:54,186 --> 00:42:55,483
<i>The stick, boy.</i>

739
00:42:55,554 --> 00:42:57,317
Bring me the stick!

740
00:42:57,389 --> 00:42:58,549
<i>Please, Rimshot,</i>

741
00:42:58,624 --> 00:43:01,058
I was just kidding about
that ugly thing, honest.

742
00:43:01,126 --> 00:43:02,423
<i>Rimshot!</i>

743
00:43:02,494 --> 00:43:03,825
Ow!

744
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:09,430
<i>Wa-aaaaaaaaaah!</i>

745
00:43:16,241 --> 00:43:18,732
<i>Well, Rimshot, it's time
to get our blood sugar</i>

746
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:22,211
back up into the combat range,
you know what I mean?

747
00:43:22,281 --> 00:43:24,841
This is serious.
I better use my C.B. voice.

748
00:43:26,351 --> 00:43:28,376
Blue Leader,
this is Troll Fighter.

749
00:43:28,453 --> 00:43:29,977
Blue Leader,
this is Troll Fighter.

750
00:43:30,055 --> 00:43:31,352
Come on back,
how 'bout you?

751
00:43:31,423 --> 00:43:34,085
Roger, Troll Fighter.
This is Blue Leader.

752
00:43:34,159 --> 00:43:36,457
Bobby, don't worry--
safety first.

753
00:43:36,528 --> 00:43:38,189
Get to work.

754
00:43:38,263 --> 00:43:40,322
<i>What's your 20, Troll Fighter?
Come on over.</i>

755
00:43:40,399 --> 00:43:42,594
<i>We are en route
to the big tree,</i>

756
00:43:42,668 --> 00:43:43,930
where we will be AWAC

757
00:43:44,002 --> 00:43:46,095
at 2300 hours
and some change.

758
00:43:46,171 --> 00:43:48,332
<i>Well, this is it,
the big night,</i>

759
00:43:48,407 --> 00:43:50,375
<i>the great confrontation
between man-- </i>

760
00:43:50,442 --> 00:43:51,841
that's us--

761
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:54,640
and the country-and-western
troll you're so fond of.

762
00:43:54,713 --> 00:43:56,044
Trolls.

763
00:43:56,114 --> 00:43:58,878
Right, Ernest, right.
Now, you stay alert.

764
00:43:58,951 --> 00:44:01,579
You see anything,
you give us a holler.

765
00:44:01,653 --> 00:44:03,052
Over and out.

766
00:44:05,791 --> 00:44:06,951
Come on, let's go.

767
00:44:07,025 --> 00:44:08,492
Oh-oh-oh-ohhh!

768
00:44:22,207 --> 00:44:25,438
You know, Jimmy,
a hungry lion hunts best,

769
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:27,842
but an army travels
on its stomach,

770
00:44:27,913 --> 00:44:29,676
know what I mean?

771
00:44:29,748 --> 00:44:32,808
<i>You going to the big party
over at the school, Ernest?</i>

772
00:44:32,884 --> 00:44:35,216
Nope, someone has to
stand vigil over the town,

773
00:44:35,287 --> 00:44:37,847
<i>stay at his post,
row the boat,</i>

774
00:44:37,923 --> 00:44:40,756
<i>be ever alert,
floss between meals,</i>

775
00:44:40,826 --> 00:44:43,317
remain steadfast
and truncated,

776
00:44:43,395 --> 00:44:44,657
<i>know what I mean?</i>

777
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:46,891
<i>Gosh, Jimmy,
what's got into you?</i>

778
00:44:48,367 --> 00:44:51,097
Oh, oh, charades. I love charades.
Let's see, something big.

779
00:44:51,169 --> 00:44:53,069
A-A big mouth?

780
00:44:53,138 --> 00:44:54,400
Let's see, big.

781
00:44:54,473 --> 00:44:56,202
Uh, big bill?
big bird?

782
00:44:56,274 --> 00:44:58,572
<i>Big bill? Big beak?
Big, uh, uh, sounds like-- </i>

783
00:44:58,643 --> 00:45:00,941
uh, two, two, "T"--
tea for two?

784
00:45:01,013 --> 00:45:03,208
<i>"T"-- two "T"?
Tea for two?</i>

785
00:45:03,281 --> 00:45:04,543
<i>Two for tea?</i>

786
00:45:04,616 --> 00:45:06,880
Desmond Tutu?
Uh, two barrels?

787
00:45:08,653 --> 00:45:10,553
<i>Ah ha.</i>

788
00:45:10,622 --> 00:45:12,613
<i>Boy, Jimmy, when you play charades,
you really play for keeps,</i>

789
00:45:12,691 --> 00:45:13,885
know what I mean?

790
00:45:13,959 --> 00:45:16,189
Oh! Ah ha.

791
00:45:19,064 --> 00:45:21,328
Hey, Greg,
have you seen my dad?

792
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,027
No. Where's your costume?

793
00:45:23,101 --> 00:45:25,535
We're supposed to be
at school now.

794
00:45:25,604 --> 00:45:26,866
<i>Kenny.</i>

795
00:45:26,938 --> 00:45:28,200
Did you hear that?

796
00:45:28,273 --> 00:45:30,537
Yeah, it-- it sounded
like Elizabeth.

797
00:45:30,609 --> 00:45:32,577
<i>Over here, Kenny.</i>

798
00:45:32,644 --> 00:45:35,204
Elizabeth?

799
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,272
Elizabeth, is that you?

800
00:45:47,392 --> 00:45:48,757
<i>Elizabeth?</i>

801
00:45:50,028 --> 00:45:51,757
She's not in--

802
00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:53,764
Over here, Kenny.

803
00:45:58,970 --> 00:46:01,871
You cannot escape.

804
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:05,068
It's time to join
your little friends.

805
00:46:10,515 --> 00:46:12,142
<i>Faster, Kenny.</i>

806
00:46:12,217 --> 00:46:14,651
<i>I'm catching up.</i>

807
00:46:16,721 --> 00:46:21,852
<i>Hurry, Kenny.
I'm right behind you.</i>

808
00:46:27,165 --> 00:46:29,065
She wouldn't leave
through the window!

809
00:46:29,134 --> 00:46:32,126
- Cliff, she didn't even want to go out!
- Joey never came home.

810
00:46:32,204 --> 00:46:34,434
<i>- Why aren't you doing something?
- We are doing something, all right?</i>

811
00:46:34,506 --> 00:46:38,033
<i>My trash hasn't been picked up
in two days, Cliff.</i>

812
00:46:38,110 --> 00:46:39,441
I'm having houseguests!

813
00:46:39,511 --> 00:46:40,705
Cliff, Cliff!
Hush! Hush!

814
00:46:40,779 --> 00:46:42,542
- Hush, hush, hush, hush, hush!
- What?!

815
00:46:42,614 --> 00:46:45,174
- Cliff, have you seen Kenny?
- No, he's supposed to be with you.

816
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:46,979
No, he ran off
to find you.

817
00:46:47,052 --> 00:46:49,020
All right, listen, he's probably
already just gone to the school.

818
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:51,851
- I don't know where he went.
- Just go to the school and look for him.

819
00:46:51,923 --> 00:46:53,948
I have houseguests
coming, Cliff!

820
00:46:54,025 --> 00:46:55,287
Listen! Listen!

821
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:58,124
They're probably already
over at the school.

822
00:47:17,048 --> 00:47:19,608
Hey, kid, get out
of the street!

823
00:47:19,684 --> 00:47:22,414
And you in the costume,
watch out!

824
00:47:33,465 --> 00:47:34,727
<i>Yeah, Rimshot,</i>

825
00:47:34,799 --> 00:47:36,664
<i>we've got to stay focused
tonight.</i>

826
00:47:36,735 --> 00:47:40,102
We've got to keep our senses
honed to a razor's edge,

827
00:47:40,172 --> 00:47:41,332
know what I mean?

828
00:47:41,406 --> 00:47:43,533
We are the thin line
of defense

829
00:47:43,608 --> 00:47:46,475
that lies between victory
and certain death,

830
00:47:46,545 --> 00:47:49,412
<i>and I guess you know
the one I'm hoping for.</i>

831
00:47:51,716 --> 00:47:54,048
Troll alert!
Troll alert, Rimshot!

832
00:47:54,119 --> 00:47:55,848
We got him!
We got him!

833
00:47:55,921 --> 00:47:58,048
We got old hockerhead
himself!

834
00:48:14,773 --> 00:48:16,968
We did it, Rimshot.

835
00:48:17,042 --> 00:48:18,509
We got him.

836
00:48:18,577 --> 00:48:20,772
Listen to him howl.

837
00:48:20,845 --> 00:48:24,372
Yeah, but it's too late
for Mr. Big, Bad Troll.

838
00:48:24,449 --> 00:48:27,885
You picked the wrong guy
to tangle with...

839
00:48:27,953 --> 00:48:29,545
Squid Lips.

840
00:48:29,621 --> 00:48:32,556
Dad, there really is a troll!
I saw it with my own eyes!

841
00:48:32,624 --> 00:48:34,182
It was horrible!

842
00:48:34,259 --> 00:48:36,386
It used Elizabeth's voice!
It turned Greg into a doll!

843
00:48:36,461 --> 00:48:39,328
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Listen, young
man, you are in big trouble.

844
00:48:39,397 --> 00:48:42,423
You disobeyed your mother, and now
she's worried sick about you.

845
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,627
Cliff, it's my boys.
They're gone, vanished.

846
00:48:44,703 --> 00:48:47,831
They were supposed to meet me hours
ago, and nobody's seen them.

847
00:48:47,906 --> 00:48:50,033
Have no fear,
Ernest P. Worrell is here.

848
00:48:50,108 --> 00:48:52,906
And, sheriff, I captured that troll
that's been stealing all the children.

849
00:48:52,978 --> 00:48:55,742
Ernest, what do you mean
you caught that troll?

850
00:48:55,814 --> 00:48:57,577
Yes, with the aid
of the most advanced

851
00:48:57,649 --> 00:48:59,810
troll-fighting equipment
known to modern technology--

852
00:48:59,884 --> 00:49:01,249
<i>Shut up, Worrell!</i>

853
00:49:01,319 --> 00:49:04,254
Cliff, you got to get out
a search party for my boys.

854
00:49:04,322 --> 00:49:06,256
Dad, Ernest and I
set troll traps!

855
00:49:06,324 --> 00:49:09,191
Listen to him!
He's not lying!

856
00:49:09,261 --> 00:49:11,456
Yeah, I've got him
right outside, sheriff.

857
00:49:11,529 --> 00:49:13,121
All right, listen,

858
00:49:13,198 --> 00:49:15,632
I don't know what's going on
here, but let's take a look.

859
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:17,361
Come on, let's see it,
Ernest.

860
00:49:19,371 --> 00:49:20,804
Uh, Cliff...

861
00:49:20,872 --> 00:49:23,773
<i>I want an all-points bulletin
out on my boys now!</i>

862
00:49:23,842 --> 00:49:26,811
You leave the police work
to me, mayor.

863
00:49:26,878 --> 00:49:28,345
Ernest, open it up.

864
00:49:28,413 --> 00:49:30,176
You want me to
squash him flat, sheriff?

865
00:49:30,248 --> 00:49:32,443
Just open the damn thing,
Ernest!

866
00:49:40,358 --> 00:49:42,121
<i>Slowly.</i>

867
00:49:42,193 --> 00:49:45,321
<i>Slowly.</i>

868
00:49:45,397 --> 00:49:46,989
<i>Oh!</i>

869
00:49:47,065 --> 00:49:48,726
<i>Oh!</i>

870
00:49:52,737 --> 00:49:55,672
Some heads are gonna roll,
ain't they, daddy?

871
00:49:59,944 --> 00:50:02,071
Blech!

872
00:50:03,315 --> 00:50:05,510
Boys.

873
00:50:05,583 --> 00:50:08,814
<i>Boy, you've done it
this time.</i>

874
00:50:08,887 --> 00:50:11,515
Ernest, I don't believe it!
Of all your screw-ups!

875
00:50:11,589 --> 00:50:14,353
But, mayor, there really is a troll.
I saw it.

876
00:50:14,426 --> 00:50:16,417
<i>Ernest is the only one
trying to do something.</i>

877
00:50:16,494 --> 00:50:18,257
Kenny, that's enough
from you.

878
00:50:18,330 --> 00:50:20,389
That does it, Worrell.
You're fired!

879
00:50:20,465 --> 00:50:22,057
Uh, but, uh, I--
the beeper!

880
00:50:22,133 --> 00:50:24,567
You park the truck,
you turn in the keys,

881
00:50:24,636 --> 00:50:26,103
and you get outta here!

882
00:50:30,108 --> 00:50:31,370
Let's go, boys.

883
00:50:31,443 --> 00:50:34,003
Ernest, you've been acting
like a child

884
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:35,512
about this troll thing.

885
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:36,945
It's time to grow up.

886
00:50:37,015 --> 00:50:39,176
But I saw them.
They were--

887
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:41,445
Kenny, come on.

888
00:50:43,621 --> 00:50:45,054
Kenny...

889
00:50:47,192 --> 00:50:48,216
Tell him.

890
00:50:52,797 --> 00:50:55,732
Kenny, get in the car!

891
00:51:03,408 --> 00:51:06,844
I guess I really blew it
this time.

892
00:51:06,911 --> 00:51:09,812
We're finished
in this town.

893
00:51:09,881 --> 00:51:12,213
So much for being a hero.

894
00:51:12,283 --> 00:51:14,717
Thanks, but it's no use.

895
00:51:14,786 --> 00:51:16,549
I'm a Worrell...

896
00:51:16,621 --> 00:51:17,883
cursed...

897
00:51:17,956 --> 00:51:20,823
bottom of the gene pool...

898
00:51:20,892 --> 00:51:22,985
no money down...

899
00:51:23,061 --> 00:51:25,552
nothing to live for.

900
00:51:30,635 --> 00:51:32,569
Yow!

901
00:51:32,637 --> 00:51:34,571
Rimshot!

902
00:51:34,639 --> 00:51:38,097
Thanks!
I needed that!

903
00:51:38,176 --> 00:51:41,441
You're right.
I've never been a quitter.

904
00:51:41,513 --> 00:51:44,914
Why-- why, I've never known
when to quit.

905
00:51:46,484 --> 00:51:49,282
Just ask
my fourth-grade teacher.

906
00:51:49,354 --> 00:51:50,616
He never knew
when to quit.

907
00:51:52,023 --> 00:51:53,923
Oh!

908
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:58,120
<i>Eliza, Michael,
Allison, Joshua... </i>

909
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:05,069
Your time has come,
my children.

910
00:52:20,585 --> 00:52:25,784
<i>One more, and the cycle
will be complete.</i>

911
00:52:41,439 --> 00:52:45,068
Well, Rimshot, I-I guess
there are no trolls here.

912
00:52:45,143 --> 00:52:46,474
Ha ha.

913
00:52:46,544 --> 00:52:49,877
Golly!
Do you believe that?

914
00:52:49,948 --> 00:52:52,473
This reminds me of that
moment from the movie

915
00:52:52,550 --> 00:52:54,484
"Brain Barnacles
from Planet Tycor,"

916
00:52:54,552 --> 00:52:57,385
<i>you know, when the brain
barnacles were getting set</i>

917
00:52:57,455 --> 00:53:00,390
to latch themselves onto
the brain of Queen Paternia?

918
00:53:00,458 --> 00:53:02,255
And then--

919
00:53:02,327 --> 00:53:03,555
Golly!

920
00:53:05,063 --> 00:53:07,190
<i>They look just like
Brussels sprouts.</i>

921
00:53:07,265 --> 00:53:09,460
I hate Brussels sprouts,
don't you?

922
00:53:10,869 --> 00:53:13,133
We better go tell
Miss Hackmore.

923
00:53:22,447 --> 00:53:25,348
<i>Gosh, Rimshot, pretty
soon, kids won't have to worry</i>

924
00:53:25,416 --> 00:53:27,509
<i>about eating
their Brussels sprouts</i>

925
00:53:27,585 --> 00:53:29,883
<i>'cause the Brussels sprouts
will be eating them!</i>

926
00:53:31,122 --> 00:53:33,113
Aaaaah!

927
00:53:33,191 --> 00:53:35,091
Quick, Troll Away!

928
00:53:36,461 --> 00:53:37,928
I can't believe it!

929
00:53:37,996 --> 00:53:40,055
It worked!
Oh, but not for long!

930
00:53:40,131 --> 00:53:42,031
He's on the roof!
Uh-oh!

931
00:53:44,135 --> 00:53:46,035
We've got to do
something!

932
00:53:46,104 --> 00:53:47,571
Aaah!

933
00:53:48,706 --> 00:53:50,537
Tom, Bobby!
Tom, Bobby, help!

934
00:53:50,608 --> 00:53:53,202
Mayday, Mayday,
Christmas Day, Columbus Day!

935
00:53:53,278 --> 00:53:54,973
<i>Tom, Bobby,
do something!</i>

936
00:53:55,046 --> 00:53:56,843
<i>He's on the roof!
Tom!</i>

937
00:53:56,915 --> 00:53:59,975
Come on in, Troll Trapper,
this is Blue Leader. Come on back.

938
00:54:00,051 --> 00:54:02,076
Tom, Bobby!
Tom, Bobby, help!

939
00:54:02,153 --> 00:54:03,984
Aaaaah!

940
00:54:04,055 --> 00:54:07,286
You're gonna pay for the sins
of your forefathers!

941
00:54:07,358 --> 00:54:08,985
I didn't have four fathers,
I just had one father,

942
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:11,221
and I didn't know him
that well!

943
00:54:13,298 --> 00:54:15,562
Ah ha ha. Too smart
for you, huh?

944
00:54:16,534 --> 00:54:20,061
Aaaaaaah!

945
00:54:21,472 --> 00:54:25,101
Aaaaaaah!

946
00:54:25,176 --> 00:54:27,474
Aaah!

947
00:54:29,314 --> 00:54:31,009
<i>Aaah! Aaah!</i>

948
00:54:31,082 --> 00:54:34,017
Get away from me,
snot locker!

949
00:54:35,853 --> 00:54:38,151
Whoa!

950
00:54:38,222 --> 00:54:40,315
Wa-aaah!

951
00:54:44,195 --> 00:54:46,993
Okay, stubby, how 'bout
a little off the top?

952
00:54:47,065 --> 00:54:47,997
<i>En garde!</i>

953
00:54:50,068 --> 00:54:51,592
<i>Uh-oh!</i>

954
00:55:00,745 --> 00:55:02,337
Aaah!

955
00:55:02,413 --> 00:55:03,846
Aha!

956
00:55:03,915 --> 00:55:05,246
<i>Little did you suspect</i>

957
00:55:05,316 --> 00:55:07,648
that I am a master
of hedge-clip-kito,

958
00:55:07,719 --> 00:55:11,086
the secret oriental fighting
art of Japanese gardeners.

959
00:55:18,796 --> 00:55:19,888
Yuh!

960
00:55:21,699 --> 00:55:23,792
We did it, Rimshot!
We got him!

961
00:55:23,868 --> 00:55:25,995
I am Troll Fighter
Number One.

962
00:55:31,776 --> 00:55:32,743
Uh-oh.

963
00:55:34,012 --> 00:55:36,003
<i>Rimshot!</i>

964
00:55:48,593 --> 00:55:50,493
I don't believe it,
Rimshot.

965
00:55:50,561 --> 00:55:53,029
He's pulling against...
200 horsepower.

966
00:55:53,097 --> 00:55:54,257
Put it in reverse.

967
00:55:58,603 --> 00:56:00,002
Oh, no!

968
00:56:00,071 --> 00:56:02,130
How 'bout a bumper sandwich,
booger lips?

969
00:56:02,206 --> 00:56:03,867
Ah heh heh heh heh heh
heh heh heh.

970
00:56:03,941 --> 00:56:06,068
Bonsai!

971
00:56:08,846 --> 00:56:10,780
Bingo!
You got him, Rimshot.

972
00:56:10,848 --> 00:56:12,839
<i>Way to go!</i>

973
00:56:17,588 --> 00:56:20,523
Where'd he go, Rimshot?

974
00:56:22,493 --> 00:56:25,428
Where'd he go? He couldn't
have just disappeared.

975
00:56:25,496 --> 00:56:28,056
By now, he must be
a greasy spot on the road.

976
00:56:28,132 --> 00:56:29,793
<i>Where did he go?</i>

977
00:56:29,867 --> 00:56:34,236
Where did he go?

978
00:56:35,707 --> 00:56:36,901
Wa-aaaaah!

979
00:56:38,376 --> 00:56:39,968
Aaaaah!

980
00:56:46,984 --> 00:56:49,475
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

981
00:56:51,622 --> 00:56:53,283
Watch out, Bobby!

982
00:56:55,126 --> 00:56:56,684
<i>Oh!</i>

983
00:56:58,923 --> 00:57:02,984
Uh! Uh! Uh! Uh!

984
00:57:10,869 --> 00:57:11,858
Ow.

985
00:57:17,442 --> 00:57:20,570
So I was mesmerizing him
with my lightning moves--

986
00:57:20,645 --> 00:57:22,135
Ow! Ah!

987
00:57:22,213 --> 00:57:24,306
And I was about to lower
that coup de grass--

988
00:57:24,382 --> 00:57:25,815
Ow! Ah!

989
00:57:25,884 --> 00:57:28,284
When old booger lips
here-- Ow!

990
00:57:28,353 --> 00:57:30,548
Called timeout--
Ow!

991
00:57:30,622 --> 00:57:32,556
And sucker-punched me.

992
00:57:32,624 --> 00:57:34,649
Oh, look. Look at this.

993
00:57:34,726 --> 00:57:37,422
There's--
there's two pages

994
00:57:37,495 --> 00:57:39,156
stuck together.

995
00:57:41,499 --> 00:57:44,730
"How th--
looks like 'thou'--

996
00:57:44,803 --> 00:57:47,237
canst destroyeth a troll."

997
00:57:47,305 --> 00:57:51,401
"Thou canst destroyeth
the troll with-- "

998
00:57:51,476 --> 00:57:55,913
Uh, M-I-something-K.

999
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:57,971
We can destroy a troll...

1000
00:57:58,049 --> 00:58:00,677
The pods
have not yet dropped.

1001
00:58:00,752 --> 00:58:01,946
Midk.

1002
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:04,079
Trantor still seeks
another child.

1003
00:58:04,155 --> 00:58:05,087
That's it!

1004
00:58:05,156 --> 00:58:07,750
Authentic Bulgarian miak.

1005
00:58:07,826 --> 00:58:11,125
They're at the school.
We've got to go.

1006
00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:12,128
Ow!

1007
00:58:12,197 --> 00:58:15,325
<i>Oh! Oh! Oh!</i>

1008
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:32,411
<i>Look, kid, go inside
and find your mother</i>

1009
00:58:32,483 --> 00:58:34,041
<i>and stay with her.</i>

1010
00:58:34,118 --> 00:58:36,313
And I don't want you to leave
her side for any reason.

1011
00:58:36,387 --> 00:58:37,649
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, sir.

1012
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:39,690
All right.

1013
00:58:41,993 --> 00:58:44,188
<i>There you go.</i>

1014
00:58:44,262 --> 00:58:45,388
Tom...

1015
00:58:45,463 --> 00:58:47,363
Tom, have you seen
Elizabeth?

1016
00:58:47,432 --> 00:58:48,865
Uh, no, I haven't.

1017
00:58:48,933 --> 00:58:49,991
Elizabeth?

1018
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:51,330
Elizabeth?

1019
00:58:51,402 --> 00:58:55,133
Kiwi fruit, kiwi fruit!
Everybody loves it!

1020
00:58:55,206 --> 00:58:57,970
Kiwi fruit!

1021
00:58:58,042 --> 00:59:00,340
Kenny?

1022
00:59:00,411 --> 00:59:02,606
Kenny.

1023
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:04,739
Tom and Bobby's
own recipe.

1024
00:59:04,816 --> 00:59:06,044
Stir-fried sushi.

1025
00:59:07,685 --> 00:59:11,314
Good evening and welcome to
the Briarville Halloween gala.

1026
00:59:12,390 --> 00:59:13,482
Smile, smile.

1027
00:59:13,558 --> 00:59:15,458
Mrs. Johnson,
have you seen Kenny?

1028
00:59:15,526 --> 00:59:18,962
No, I haven't, and we really
can't wait any longer.

1029
00:59:19,030 --> 00:59:21,191
Ernest's troll probably
got him.

1030
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:24,758
<i>... the hottest band
in Taylor County-- </i>

1031
00:59:24,836 --> 00:59:25,996
The Fun Box.

1032
00:59:34,412 --> 00:59:36,380
Come on, Rimshot.

1033
00:59:36,447 --> 00:59:38,972
Of all the people
in the world, why him?

1034
00:59:39,050 --> 00:59:41,416
<i>Look, you wanted to be
in the costume competition,</i>

1035
00:59:41,486 --> 00:59:43,954
<i>and this is the costume
you picked out at the store.</i>

1036
00:59:44,022 --> 00:59:46,081
This thing looks silly.
And I'm not gonna wear it.

1037
00:59:46,157 --> 00:59:47,385
Don't you talk back to me.

1038
00:59:47,458 --> 00:59:48,686
<i>Now, you march right
in there.</i>

1039
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:49,818
I hate you!

1040
00:59:49,894 --> 00:59:52,328
Well, I'm not too fond
of you either!

1041
00:59:52,397 --> 00:59:56,231
Mommy... I'm sorry.

1042
00:59:59,804 --> 01:00:02,864
I love you.

1043
01:00:02,941 --> 01:00:06,570
I love you, too.

1044
01:00:11,382 --> 01:00:15,216
Unconditional love.

1045
01:00:15,286 --> 01:00:20,588
That's the heart of a child.

1046
01:00:20,658 --> 01:00:23,058
Trolls! Trolls!

1047
01:00:23,127 --> 01:00:26,426
Save the kids! Trolls!

1048
01:00:26,497 --> 01:00:28,260
Tro--

1049
01:00:31,269 --> 01:00:32,463
Uh.

1050
01:00:32,537 --> 01:00:35,404
<i>It's my privilege
to welcome you</i>

1051
01:00:35,473 --> 01:00:37,839
- to the costume competition--
- Run for your lives!

1052
01:00:37,909 --> 01:00:39,035
Trolls!

1053
01:00:39,110 --> 01:00:40,168
<i>Ernest!</i>

1054
01:00:40,244 --> 01:00:42,872
Will somebody get him
out of here? Now!

1055
01:00:42,947 --> 01:00:44,915
Run for your lives!

1056
01:00:44,983 --> 01:00:46,610
Shh. Shh.

1057
01:00:46,684 --> 01:00:48,584
Run for your lives!

1058
01:00:48,653 --> 01:00:49,745
Shh. Shh.

1059
01:00:49,821 --> 01:00:51,254
Now, as your mayor,

1060
01:00:51,322 --> 01:00:55,281
it's my privilege to bring you
the costume competition.

1061
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,827
<i>And to start it off-- </i>

1062
01:00:56,894 --> 01:00:59,488
<i>our first contestant
is Rachel Benson</i>

1063
01:00:59,564 --> 01:01:02,055
<i>from Miss Johnson's
fourth-grade class.</i>

1064
01:01:02,133 --> 01:01:03,065
<i>Rachel... </i>

1065
01:01:06,104 --> 01:01:08,504
Eeeww, scary costume.

1066
01:01:08,573 --> 01:01:12,134
I know a dork
when I see one.

1067
01:01:20,018 --> 01:01:21,542
Matt!

1068
01:01:21,619 --> 01:01:23,712
Matt! Matt!

1069
01:01:23,788 --> 01:01:26,916
<i>Help! Help!</i>

1070
01:01:26,991 --> 01:01:29,755
<i>Help! Help!</i>

1071
01:01:29,827 --> 01:01:30,919
Aaaahhh!

1072
01:01:41,305 --> 01:01:43,535
Please,
I've got to find Ernest.

1073
01:01:43,608 --> 01:01:45,906
Please,
I've got to find Ernest.

1074
01:01:49,147 --> 01:01:51,741
It's the end of the line
for you, shortchange.

1075
01:01:51,816 --> 01:01:55,445
<i>Aloha, sayonara,
el rancho grande.</i>

1076
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:59,115
You're history, pal.
You're Elvis.

1077
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:08,631
<i>So, come on, crater face,
I'm ready for you.</i>

1078
01:02:11,836 --> 01:02:15,363
Let's see how you like
a little miak.

1079
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,431
Miak?

1080
01:02:17,508 --> 01:02:20,341
Yeah, miak.

1081
01:02:20,411 --> 01:02:23,574
I bet you thought I couldn't
find any this time of year.

1082
01:02:23,648 --> 01:02:26,173
Well, I'm a little
too resourceful for you,

1083
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:28,115
a little too light
on my feet.

1084
01:02:28,186 --> 01:02:30,154
So, come on,
eat miak and die--

1085
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:42,323
Uuuhhhhhhh!

1086
01:02:45,937 --> 01:02:49,532
<i>Rimshot, come back!</i>

1087
01:02:53,211 --> 01:02:57,045
Ohhhh.

1088
01:02:57,949 --> 01:03:00,213
Wa-aaahhhh!

1089
01:03:01,652 --> 01:03:02,812
Ahhh!

1090
01:03:02,887 --> 01:03:04,354
Uh! Uh!

1091
01:03:05,890 --> 01:03:08,358
Huh?

1092
01:03:13,698 --> 01:03:15,029
Huh.

1093
01:03:16,934 --> 01:03:18,959
<i>What happened?</i>

1094
01:03:19,036 --> 01:03:22,233
Oh, Ernest,
are you all right?

1095
01:03:22,306 --> 01:03:23,500
Yeah. Yeah.

1096
01:03:23,574 --> 01:03:26,441
When that thing saw who
it was fooling with,

1097
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:28,945
it was drop back and punt,

1098
01:03:29,013 --> 01:03:31,880
regroup,
troll trauma time.

1099
01:03:31,949 --> 01:03:35,350
Yeah, this guy
is bad to the bone.

1100
01:03:35,419 --> 01:03:36,477
Ernest...

1101
01:03:36,554 --> 01:03:38,488
Rimshot.

1102
01:03:38,556 --> 01:03:41,889
Rimshot, old boy.

1103
01:03:45,096 --> 01:03:46,529
What am I gonna do?

1104
01:03:46,597 --> 01:03:47,791
He's all I got.

1105
01:03:47,865 --> 01:03:49,355
Don't worry, Ernest.

1106
01:03:49,433 --> 01:03:52,368
We'll find some way
to beat this thing.

1107
01:03:52,436 --> 01:03:55,405
I'll tell you
how we beat this thing--

1108
01:03:55,473 --> 01:03:57,338
I'll tell you
how we do it--

1109
01:03:57,408 --> 01:04:00,809
my great-great-grandaddy
put him in that hole,

1110
01:04:00,878 --> 01:04:02,368
and so can I.

1111
01:04:02,446 --> 01:04:06,678
Somebody with a runny nose
is gonna die.

1112
01:04:06,751 --> 01:04:09,276
<i>Yeah! Go get him!</i>

1113
01:04:25,403 --> 01:04:29,499
Mother's care...
milk.

1114
01:04:29,574 --> 01:04:34,341
That's it... milk.

1115
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:42,742
You're one dead troll,

1116
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:47,314
you pint-sized,
sawed-off bucketmouth.

1117
01:04:47,391 --> 01:04:48,517
That thing's got my son.

1118
01:04:48,593 --> 01:04:50,493
We've got to kill it now!
It's up to us!

1119
01:04:50,561 --> 01:04:52,825
Wait, what are you talking about?
Kill what? Go where?

1120
01:04:52,897 --> 01:04:55,195
Ernest says it's at a tree
at the Hackmore place.

1121
01:04:55,266 --> 01:04:57,700
Yeah, dad, it's milk.
Milk kills the troll.

1122
01:04:57,768 --> 01:04:59,599
<i>Let's go.
We're wasting time.</i>

1123
01:04:59,670 --> 01:05:01,035
Hang on, mayor.
What?

1124
01:05:01,105 --> 01:05:03,630
It's the mother's care,
the ice cream-- milk!

1125
01:05:03,708 --> 01:05:04,640
<i>Let's go.</i>

1126
01:05:04,709 --> 01:05:05,767
Murdock--

1127
01:05:05,843 --> 01:05:07,834
Kenny, listen,
wait here, all right?

1128
01:05:07,912 --> 01:05:10,745
Your mother's looking for you.
We'll take care of this.

1129
01:05:10,815 --> 01:05:12,009
Murdock!

1130
01:05:13,317 --> 01:05:15,308
What's the matter, boy?
There's no time to waste.

1131
01:05:15,386 --> 01:05:16,751
My dad told me
to stay here.

1132
01:05:16,821 --> 01:05:18,880
Sometimes you got to do
what you know is right,

1133
01:05:18,956 --> 01:05:22,187
no matter what
anybody tells you.

1134
01:05:38,643 --> 01:05:40,508
What good's a wooden dog?

1135
01:05:40,578 --> 01:05:44,605
Oh, sure, they swim better,
but what am I gonna call him?

1136
01:05:44,682 --> 01:05:45,671
Splinter?

1137
01:05:45,750 --> 01:05:48,685
Hey, Binder...

1138
01:05:50,788 --> 01:05:52,551
Sorry about Matt.

1139
01:05:56,460 --> 01:05:58,394
How do we take
this thing out?

1140
01:05:58,462 --> 01:06:02,023
Follow me.

1141
01:06:02,099 --> 01:06:03,623
- Yeah! Come on!
- Yeah!

1142
01:06:03,701 --> 01:06:04,690
Come on!

1143
01:06:17,882 --> 01:06:24,185
One final soul
to set my children free.

1144
01:06:41,939 --> 01:06:43,406
Raaaaaarrr!

1145
01:06:43,474 --> 01:06:49,640
Okay, booger lips, it's time
for troll squish-kabob.

1146
01:06:55,119 --> 01:06:57,713
Aaahhhh!

1147
01:07:07,331 --> 01:07:09,663
You okay, Rimshot?
Good.

1148
01:07:09,734 --> 01:07:13,261
Another advantage of being
a wooden dog.

1149
01:07:25,449 --> 01:07:28,350
Where'd he go?

1150
01:07:34,058 --> 01:07:36,356
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

1151
01:07:38,596 --> 01:07:40,928
<i>There's your big-time
Brussels sprouts.</i>

1152
01:07:44,268 --> 01:07:47,704
We can't let these
hit the ground, Rimshot.

1153
01:07:47,772 --> 01:07:48,932
<i>Got that?</i>

1154
01:07:53,577 --> 01:07:55,340
<i>Got it.</i>

1155
01:07:57,181 --> 01:07:59,342
<i>Uh-oh. Uh-oh.</i>

1156
01:08:01,385 --> 01:08:03,319
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

1157
01:08:13,697 --> 01:08:15,255
<i>Oh, no.</i>

1158
01:08:22,973 --> 01:08:26,238
<i>Oh, no.
This looks real bad.</i>

1159
01:08:26,310 --> 01:08:28,710
<i>Ooohhh.</i>

1160
01:08:38,122 --> 01:08:40,181
<i>Not another one.</i>

1161
01:08:44,328 --> 01:08:46,888
Heh heh heh heh.

1162
01:08:46,964 --> 01:08:48,761
Time to put a lid on this.

1163
01:08:51,802 --> 01:08:53,929
A little body pressure
should do the trick.

1164
01:08:58,442 --> 01:09:01,002
Wa-aahhhh!

1165
01:09:04,148 --> 01:09:06,275
Hit the end of the aisle
and split up!

1166
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:08,045
<i>What are you kids doing?!</i>

1167
01:09:08,118 --> 01:09:09,551
It's an emergency!

1168
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:11,417
- Hey, you can't ride in here!
- This is important!

1169
01:09:11,489 --> 01:09:12,421
Get out of this store!

1170
01:09:12,490 --> 01:09:13,787
Go for the ammo!

1171
01:09:13,858 --> 01:09:16,224
Those costumes
don't fool me!

1172
01:09:16,293 --> 01:09:17,419
<i>Move it!</i>

1173
01:09:17,495 --> 01:09:19,759
<i>Let's go!
Let's go!</i>

1174
01:09:19,830 --> 01:09:22,594
<i>The milk!
I'll get the milk!</i>

1175
01:09:28,205 --> 01:09:29,433
<i>Let's go!</i>

1176
01:09:29,507 --> 01:09:31,031
<i>Come on!</i>

1177
01:09:31,108 --> 01:09:33,838
Kenny Barton, when your father
hears about this, he's gonna--

1178
01:09:33,911 --> 01:09:35,139
Wait! Whoa!

1179
01:09:35,212 --> 01:09:38,613
<i>We're running
out of time!</i>

1180
01:09:53,664 --> 01:09:55,757
Yeah! Ha ha ha!

1181
01:09:57,301 --> 01:09:59,895
<i>This is getting out of hand.</i>

1182
01:10:04,308 --> 01:10:08,301
Devour the human.

1183
01:10:10,147 --> 01:10:11,307
And the crowd goes wild.

1184
01:10:11,382 --> 01:10:14,112
This one's over the fence
and out of the park.

1185
01:10:14,184 --> 01:10:16,311
This looks like three more
R.B.I.s.

1186
01:10:16,387 --> 01:10:17,945
Uh!

1187
01:10:18,022 --> 01:10:19,649
Diihh!

1188
01:10:19,723 --> 01:10:21,315
Uh!

1189
01:10:29,266 --> 01:10:31,359
Attack! Attack!

1190
01:10:31,435 --> 01:10:33,835
<i>Spread out.
We'll find it.</i>

1191
01:10:33,904 --> 01:10:35,735
There's nothing to worry about, folks.

1192
01:10:35,806 --> 01:10:37,000
I got it all under control.

1193
01:10:37,074 --> 01:10:38,701
Uh!

1194
01:10:39,910 --> 01:10:41,639
Hold it right there.
Hold it.

1195
01:10:41,712 --> 01:10:43,441
You-- hey, stop.
Wait a minute.

1196
01:10:43,514 --> 01:10:44,446
Let go of me.

1197
01:10:47,851 --> 01:10:50,820
Give me that.

1198
01:10:50,921 --> 01:10:53,515
Let go of my shotgun.

1199
01:10:53,591 --> 01:10:54,853
Yaaahhh!

1200
01:10:54,925 --> 01:10:58,224
Don't you have any respect
for authority?

1201
01:11:00,965 --> 01:11:03,024
<i>Come on, you!</i>

1202
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:07,434
<i>There's another one!
Uh huh!</i>

1203
01:11:09,306 --> 01:11:11,103
Uh, your shoe's untied.

1204
01:11:11,175 --> 01:11:14,008
Think of a number between 1 and 10.

1205
01:11:14,078 --> 01:11:15,010
Was it 2?

1206
01:11:15,079 --> 01:11:16,569
Ahhhhh!

1207
01:11:21,952 --> 01:11:23,317
Ah-ahhhhh!

1208
01:11:25,923 --> 01:11:27,481
Ahhhh!

1209
01:11:31,829 --> 01:11:32,955
Oh, no.

1210
01:11:33,030 --> 01:11:37,490
They're gonna blame this
all on me.

1211
01:11:42,539 --> 01:11:43,870
Oh ho ho ho ho ho.

1212
01:11:43,941 --> 01:11:46,933
<i>Bobby, pictures of these things
in the National Enquirer</i>

1213
01:11:47,011 --> 01:11:49,605
will make us rich
beyond our wildest dreams.

1214
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:51,648
Get the camera out.
Go, go, go.

1215
01:11:51,715 --> 01:11:52,909
Oh, gorgeous.

1216
01:11:52,983 --> 01:11:55,247
Money, money, money,
money, money, money.

1217
01:11:55,319 --> 01:11:57,344
<i>So you want
to play rough, huh?</i>

1218
01:12:04,528 --> 01:12:06,860
Ahhhhhh!

1219
01:12:09,633 --> 01:12:10,895
Ha ha ha.

1220
01:12:10,968 --> 01:12:12,868
Oh, I can just see
the headlines now.

1221
01:12:12,936 --> 01:12:17,032
"Briarville businessman has close
encounter with alien nation."

1222
01:12:17,107 --> 01:12:18,734
There's more.
Let's go.

1223
01:12:18,809 --> 01:12:19,741
Hoo hoo.

1224
01:12:19,810 --> 01:12:20,799
Help me! Help!

1225
01:12:20,878 --> 01:12:23,244
Get it off of me!
Get it off of me!

1226
01:12:23,313 --> 01:12:25,042
There's a troll on my back!

1227
01:12:25,115 --> 01:12:28,516
Worrell selects a ball
and steps to the line.

1228
01:12:28,585 --> 01:12:31,281
It looks like
a tricky 7-10 split.

1229
01:12:31,355 --> 01:12:33,414
A hush falls over the crowd.

1230
01:12:33,490 --> 01:12:36,220
There's a troll on me!
Help!

1231
01:12:36,293 --> 01:12:37,521
Here it comes.

1232
01:12:37,594 --> 01:12:40,825
The famous Worrell twist...
the release...

1233
01:12:42,566 --> 01:12:43,794
Yes! It's good!

1234
01:12:43,867 --> 01:12:45,494
The crowd goes wild!

1235
01:12:47,638 --> 01:12:49,367
I'd like to thank you,
each and every one,

1236
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:50,873
for this beautiful
bowling trophy.

1237
01:12:50,941 --> 01:12:52,602
Thank you, thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you, thank you,

1238
01:12:52,676 --> 01:12:54,405
thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you, thank you.

1239
01:12:54,478 --> 01:12:56,446
<i>Thank you, thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.</i>

1240
01:12:56,513 --> 01:12:57,912
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

1241
01:12:57,981 --> 01:12:59,539
He never knew
when to quit.

1242
01:13:01,085 --> 01:13:02,177
Oh.

1243
01:13:11,662 --> 01:13:13,254
Kenny? Kenny!

1244
01:13:13,330 --> 01:13:15,628
<i>We can't stop now.</i>

1245
01:13:19,737 --> 01:13:27,473
Bring me the head
of Ernest P. Worrell.

1246
01:13:32,049 --> 01:13:35,382
Say, I'll bet you guys have
trouble meeting girls.

1247
01:13:35,452 --> 01:13:37,716
<i>Don't know what to say, what
to do, how to get things going.</i>

1248
01:13:37,788 --> 01:13:38,812
Heh heh heh.

1249
01:13:38,889 --> 01:13:40,413
Well, here's the answer
to your problems.

1250
01:13:40,491 --> 01:13:43,654
It's the Pimco largemouth bass CD
and home-entertainment center.

1251
01:13:43,727 --> 01:13:47,060
A state-of-the-art sound system
mounted on genuine veneer.

1252
01:13:47,131 --> 01:13:49,122
But wait, there's more.

1253
01:13:55,439 --> 01:13:56,906
Ahhhhh!

1254
01:13:58,909 --> 01:14:00,206
I'm too young to die.

1255
01:14:00,277 --> 01:14:02,211
Don't kill me.
Don't kill me.

1256
01:14:02,279 --> 01:14:04,440
Ohhhhhhh.
Don't kill me, please.

1257
01:14:10,954 --> 01:14:14,549
I hope I'm not too late.

1258
01:14:14,625 --> 01:14:17,423
Ohh!
Give me back that gun!

1259
01:14:17,494 --> 01:14:19,394
No! Put that down!

1260
01:14:19,463 --> 01:14:20,555
<i>That's loaded!
Hey!</i>

1261
01:14:21,598 --> 01:14:23,327
<i>Oh, no, not the bullets.</i>

1262
01:14:26,136 --> 01:14:29,867
Too fast for you?

1263
01:14:29,940 --> 01:14:31,703
Too smart for you, too.

1264
01:14:31,775 --> 01:14:32,764
- Ow!
- Ow!

1265
01:14:32,843 --> 01:14:35,038
Gotcha.
Ah heh heh heh heh.

1266
01:14:35,112 --> 01:14:36,602
Here we go again.

1267
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:38,443
<i>No, no, no.</i>

1268
01:14:51,662 --> 01:14:54,062
Here, here, get the milk.
Come on.

1269
01:14:54,131 --> 01:14:55,155
Let's go.

1270
01:14:59,002 --> 01:15:00,936
Dad.

1271
01:15:02,506 --> 01:15:03,598
No.

1272
01:15:03,674 --> 01:15:06,609
You sure this milk thing
is gonna work?

1273
01:15:06,677 --> 01:15:08,144
We're gonna find out.

1274
01:15:08,212 --> 01:15:09,144
<i>Whoa. No.</i>

1275
01:15:09,213 --> 01:15:12,546
Kenny! Kenny, no!
No! Kenny, no!

1276
01:15:12,616 --> 01:15:16,052
Milk works, dad.
It really works.

1277
01:15:27,664 --> 01:15:28,596
Yes!

1278
01:15:28,665 --> 01:15:30,257
Get the key.
Get the key.

1279
01:15:30,334 --> 01:15:31,631
Here. I gotta go.

1280
01:15:31,702 --> 01:15:34,262
<i>Kenny!
Go get 'em, Kenny!</i>

1281
01:15:36,206 --> 01:15:37,969
Come on, guys.

1282
01:15:38,041 --> 01:15:40,100
Let's go get 'em.

1283
01:15:42,913 --> 01:15:44,608
Ahhhhh! Ahhh!

1284
01:15:56,593 --> 01:15:58,823
<i>I've only got a couple
of things left.</i>

1285
01:15:58,896 --> 01:16:00,261
Ernest!

1286
01:16:00,330 --> 01:16:03,163
Hold on!
I'm coming up!

1287
01:16:05,769 --> 01:16:07,862
<i>Stop it.</i>

1288
01:16:07,938 --> 01:16:10,338
This is just the kind of Halloween
prank that gets people hurt.

1289
01:16:10,407 --> 01:16:12,932
<i>Ow!</i>

1290
01:16:13,010 --> 01:16:13,977
Hey, butt breath!

1291
01:16:14,044 --> 01:16:15,739
Huh?

1292
01:16:22,886 --> 01:16:24,046
How'd you do that?

1293
01:16:24,121 --> 01:16:26,180
It's the milk.
It eradicates them.

1294
01:16:26,256 --> 01:16:28,224
Yeah, it gets
rid of 'em, too.

1295
01:16:33,263 --> 01:16:36,198
<i>Sayonara, snot wad.</i>

1296
01:16:37,968 --> 01:16:40,994
E-e-e-e-e-w.

1297
01:16:44,474 --> 01:16:51,209
Evil demons...
make me strong.

1298
01:16:58,555 --> 01:17:00,853
Ahh!

1299
01:17:02,759 --> 01:17:04,659
Your time has come.

1300
01:17:04,728 --> 01:17:08,095
Tonight the spell
will be broken.

1301
01:17:08,165 --> 01:17:12,033
At last our prayers
have been answered.

1302
01:17:12,102 --> 01:17:17,369
Soon, my little ones, soon.

1303
01:17:17,441 --> 01:17:18,703
Aaahhh!

1304
01:17:18,775 --> 01:17:21,175
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh!

1305
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:26,572
Hey! Let me go!

1306
01:17:26,650 --> 01:17:28,311
What are they up to?

1307
01:17:28,385 --> 01:17:31,786
Don't worry, kid.
We got the high ground.

1308
01:17:31,855 --> 01:17:33,720
Did you hear something?

1309
01:17:33,790 --> 01:17:36,122
Boy, I sure did.

1310
01:17:39,329 --> 01:17:42,594
We came, we saw,
we took the high ground.

1311
01:17:42,666 --> 01:17:45,032
Even though some of us
are very tired.

1312
01:17:45,102 --> 01:17:46,569
Trolls, is it?

1313
01:17:46,636 --> 01:17:48,467
Oh, great,
I have to defend the fort

1314
01:17:48,538 --> 01:17:49,869
with a multiple personality.

1315
01:17:51,274 --> 01:17:54,937
Ew, look, they're using
those hook things.

1316
01:17:55,012 --> 01:17:57,207
Where's my machine gun?

1317
01:17:57,280 --> 01:18:00,044
Where's my little machine gun?

1318
01:18:00,117 --> 01:18:02,642
We were looking for a good scrap
when we found this one.

1319
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:05,552
Now, chin up,
every man jack of you.

1320
01:18:05,622 --> 01:18:07,749
<i>A little nasal hygiene</i>

1321
01:18:07,824 --> 01:18:10,657
would go
a long way, young man.

1322
01:18:10,727 --> 01:18:11,955
Here you go.

1323
01:18:13,363 --> 01:18:14,921
I hope you're grateful.

1324
01:18:14,998 --> 01:18:17,933
Little trolls in China
don't even get milk.

1325
01:18:18,001 --> 01:18:21,061
Ahhhh!

1326
01:18:21,138 --> 01:18:24,301
Hair spray will fix
anything.

1327
01:18:24,374 --> 01:18:25,966
This is big money.

1328
01:18:26,043 --> 01:18:28,944
Posters, troll action
figures, trading cards.

1329
01:18:29,012 --> 01:18:29,979
Hey!

1330
01:18:30,047 --> 01:18:31,776
<i>You, come back here!</i>

1331
01:18:31,848 --> 01:18:36,080
Bobby, do something!
He's eating the film!

1332
01:18:37,354 --> 01:18:39,117
Bobby, do something!
No!

1333
01:18:46,129 --> 01:18:47,061
Oh.

1334
01:18:47,130 --> 01:18:48,597
Bobby...

1335
01:18:48,665 --> 01:18:54,035
This was our ticket
to the big time.

1336
01:18:54,104 --> 01:18:56,436
We're finished.

1337
01:18:56,506 --> 01:18:58,167
<i>Only a few more to go.</i>

1338
01:18:58,241 --> 01:18:59,333
Load it up.

1339
01:18:59,409 --> 01:19:01,707
You sure this will stop
them trolls?

1340
01:19:01,778 --> 01:19:04,212
They look awful
goddang fierce to me.

1341
01:19:04,281 --> 01:19:06,181
Anybody can whip a troll.

1342
01:19:06,249 --> 01:19:08,774
<i>Ace, the wall.</i>

1343
01:19:08,852 --> 01:19:11,719
Eat lactose, slimeball.

1344
01:19:18,061 --> 01:19:19,824
Hold on, dad!

1345
01:19:21,031 --> 01:19:23,295
Son, stay back!
Stay back, son!

1346
01:19:37,914 --> 01:19:42,283
You fellas like, uh, a little
bit of this milk punch?

1347
01:19:45,789 --> 01:19:49,190
That milk
must have gone bad.

1348
01:19:49,259 --> 01:19:52,820
I'm sorry, men,
but the dropper is the only way.

1349
01:19:52,896 --> 01:19:54,659
Oh, no, not the dropper.

1350
01:19:54,731 --> 01:19:56,426
The doomsday dropper.

1351
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:57,933
Oh, no, not that.

1352
01:19:58,001 --> 01:19:59,696
Is there no mercy?

1353
01:19:59,769 --> 01:20:01,066
I like it.

1354
01:20:01,138 --> 01:20:04,938
A woman's work
is never done.

1355
01:20:08,345 --> 01:20:11,314
<i>I guess I'll have to
finish this myself.</i>

1356
01:20:13,450 --> 01:20:15,577
Come, demons.

1357
01:20:15,652 --> 01:20:18,120
Work your worst.

1358
01:20:18,188 --> 01:20:21,180
Make me now invincible.

1359
01:20:47,784 --> 01:20:49,274
<i>A whole troll army wiped out,</i>

1360
01:20:49,352 --> 01:20:52,116
<i>and they leave the last two
for me.</i>

1361
01:21:05,335 --> 01:21:07,565
Victory is ours.

1362
01:21:07,637 --> 01:21:08,661
All right!

1363
01:21:08,738 --> 01:21:11,434
We'll never be hungry again.

1364
01:21:11,508 --> 01:21:15,467
<i>Talk about relief, oh.</i>

1365
01:21:15,545 --> 01:21:19,072
No muss, no fuss, the trolls
are dust, know what I mean?

1366
01:21:19,149 --> 01:21:20,844
Yeah. We did it.
We won.

1367
01:21:20,917 --> 01:21:25,013
You know,
I knew when the chips were down,

1368
01:21:25,088 --> 01:21:27,056
I could count on you,
pilgrim.

1369
01:21:27,123 --> 01:21:29,785
Thanks, Ernest. You did
pretty good yourself.

1370
01:21:29,859 --> 01:21:31,690
You're a great bunch
of guys.

1371
01:21:36,399 --> 01:21:38,196
All right, Kenny!

1372
01:21:38,268 --> 01:21:40,634
<i>Way to go, Kenny!
All right!</i>

1373
01:21:42,539 --> 01:21:45,007
You don't understand.
It's not over yet.

1374
01:21:45,075 --> 01:21:46,337
It's not over yet.

1375
01:21:46,409 --> 01:21:50,607
You don't understand.
It's not over yet.

1376
01:22:03,793 --> 01:22:05,021
Uh-oh.

1377
01:22:05,095 --> 01:22:07,222
Kenny, behind you!

1378
01:22:15,639 --> 01:22:18,904
We've got to do
something!

1379
01:22:18,975 --> 01:22:19,999
Kenny!

1380
01:22:29,319 --> 01:22:30,343
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

1381
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:32,047
Kenny!
Kenny, get out of there!

1382
01:22:32,122 --> 01:22:33,589
Kenny, jump!

1383
01:22:33,657 --> 01:22:37,058
Kenny,
I told you, it's the legend.

1384
01:22:37,127 --> 01:22:39,095
Ernest!

1385
01:22:42,565 --> 01:22:45,261
I've grown too strong
for that.

1386
01:22:45,335 --> 01:22:48,668
<i>Not even milk
can stop me now.</i>

1387
01:22:48,738 --> 01:22:54,267
Errrneeeeest!

1388
01:23:00,984 --> 01:23:02,008
Kenny!

1389
01:23:02,085 --> 01:23:04,110
Kenny!

1390
01:23:06,556 --> 01:23:08,820
<i>No!</i>

1391
01:23:13,363 --> 01:23:17,629
Kenny... Kenny...

1392
01:23:21,771 --> 01:23:23,432
Ah!

1393
01:23:48,031 --> 01:23:51,125
You've had a nasty cold
ever since we met.

1394
01:23:51,201 --> 01:23:53,169
It's going around, you know.

1395
01:23:53,236 --> 01:23:55,500
<i>- You know what they always say--</i>

1396
01:23:55,572 --> 01:23:56,971
starve a fever,
feed a cold.

1397
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:59,201
Or is it feed a fever,
starve a cold?

1398
01:23:59,275 --> 01:24:00,640
I always get that confused,

1399
01:24:00,710 --> 01:24:01,972
like 30 days hath
September.

1400
01:24:02,045 --> 01:24:03,410
It's my club and you're
a member, and, uh...

1401
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:08,144
Worrell, now you die.

1402
01:24:15,258 --> 01:24:16,657
Come on, double ugly,

1403
01:24:16,726 --> 01:24:19,354
you do pretty well against
little kids and dogs.

1404
01:24:19,429 --> 01:24:21,454
Let's see how you deal
with a real man.

1405
01:24:21,531 --> 01:24:23,294
Come on.
Come on!

1406
01:24:23,366 --> 01:24:24,424
Kill him!

1407
01:24:24,501 --> 01:24:27,095
Come on!
Kill him!

1408
01:24:27,170 --> 01:24:30,333
Come on, snot wad.
I got something for you.

1409
01:24:32,842 --> 01:24:35,333
Come on!
Come on!

1410
01:24:35,412 --> 01:24:40,111
Ernest doesn't understand.
It's not the milk.

1411
01:24:40,183 --> 01:24:44,620
Unconditional love,
the heart of a child.

1412
01:24:53,897 --> 01:24:57,025
Unconditional love.

1413
01:24:57,100 --> 01:24:59,432
Yeah!

1414
01:24:59,502 --> 01:25:01,800
Kill him!

1415
01:25:01,871 --> 01:25:03,566
Kill him!

1416
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:08,339
Heart of a child,
unconditional love.

1417
01:25:08,411 --> 01:25:13,576
Kill him!

1418
01:25:24,527 --> 01:25:26,427
Come on, little fella.

1419
01:25:54,924 --> 01:25:58,826
Oh, you're so cute.

1420
01:26:01,698 --> 01:26:05,099
E-e-e-e-e-w.

1421
01:26:31,027 --> 01:26:33,461
Great. You did it.
You're a real hero.

1422
01:26:33,530 --> 01:26:36,090
Yeah, you really did it.
You're a legend.

1423
01:26:36,165 --> 01:26:37,860
Yeah,
he never had a chance.

1424
01:26:37,934 --> 01:26:41,131
With my brains and speed,
he never knew what hit him.

1425
01:26:41,204 --> 01:26:43,069
<i>Yeah,
it almost wasn't fair.</i>

1426
01:26:43,139 --> 01:26:45,073
<i>Here, he had
some good moves,</i>

1427
01:26:45,141 --> 01:26:47,473
<i>but when the chips
were down... </i>

1428
01:26:47,544 --> 01:26:48,806
Huh?

1429
01:26:55,985 --> 01:26:58,283
But, you know, when you're
fighting those trolls,

1430
01:26:58,354 --> 01:26:59,514
you gotta sock 'em one...

1431
01:26:59,589 --> 01:27:01,784
- Kenny!
- right in the kisser.

1432
01:27:01,858 --> 01:27:03,792
Like my ancestor Phineas
used to tell me,

1433
01:27:03,860 --> 01:27:07,296
"Ernie baby,
keep your weight down low."

1434
01:27:07,363 --> 01:27:09,297
Son, are you all right?

1435
01:27:09,365 --> 01:27:11,230
That was
really weird.

1436
01:27:11,301 --> 01:27:14,634
Mom, I told you
there was a troll.

1437
01:27:14,704 --> 01:27:17,036
Mike,
I'm glad to see you.

1438
01:27:17,106 --> 01:27:20,701
Kenny, I thought we'd
never see you again.

1439
01:27:20,777 --> 01:27:21,835
Mom.

1440
01:27:21,911 --> 01:27:24,379
Son, I did
a lot of things wrong.

1441
01:27:24,447 --> 01:27:28,543
I should've listened to you.
I'm so proud of you.

1442
01:27:28,618 --> 01:27:29,778
Thanks, dad.

1443
01:27:29,852 --> 01:27:31,752
Stay low,
stay sitting...

1444
01:27:31,821 --> 01:27:33,311
You know, Ernest,

1445
01:27:33,389 --> 01:27:37,257
<i>in recognition of your
magnificent achievement,</i>

1446
01:27:37,327 --> 01:27:40,592
consider that
Troll Away spray a gift.

1447
01:27:40,663 --> 01:27:42,995
Maybe we should open
a laundry.

1448
01:27:49,172 --> 01:27:50,571
Francis?

1449
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:52,232
<i>Sister Francis?</i>

1450
01:27:53,409 --> 01:27:54,842
Is that you?

1451
01:27:54,911 --> 01:27:57,471
My sister.
My sister.

1452
01:27:57,547 --> 01:27:59,845
Ohhh. I missed you so.

1453
01:27:59,916 --> 01:28:03,352
Michael, Michael,
I missed you.

1454
01:28:03,419 --> 01:28:05,614
How'd you get so old?

1455
01:28:05,688 --> 01:28:08,521
There is a lot to talk
about, but now,

1456
01:28:08,591 --> 01:28:13,051
everything is okay.

1457
01:28:28,077 --> 01:28:31,012
What's the matter,
Ernest?

1458
01:28:31,080 --> 01:28:35,016
There's nothing
in that tree for me.

1459
01:28:44,093 --> 01:28:45,890
Rimshot.

1460
01:28:45,962 --> 01:28:47,896
<i>Rimshot!
Rimshot!</i>

1461
01:28:47,964 --> 01:28:49,329
Boy,
where have you been?

1462
01:28:49,399 --> 01:28:50,832
Did you miss your daddy?

1463
01:28:50,900 --> 01:28:53,368
You were gone and stuff.
And you were a wooden guy.

1464
01:28:53,436 --> 01:28:56,337
Now you're back, and you're
not even gone anymore.

1465
01:28:56,406 --> 01:28:57,498
You know
where we're going?

1466
01:28:57,573 --> 01:28:58,972
We're going for a ride
in the truck,

1467
01:28:59,042 --> 01:29:02,307
and we're gonna--
gonna go home and--

1468
01:29:02,378 --> 01:29:05,176
and we'll eat
nothing but the best...
