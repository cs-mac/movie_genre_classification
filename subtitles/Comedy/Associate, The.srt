1
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,725
Very impressive. Nice work, Walter.

2
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:03,523
It was Frank and Laurel's show.
I'm here to make you feel important.

3
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,129
Don't listen to him, Carl.
Everything coming from this company

4
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,570
has his stamp. We do the grunt work.
- I didn't grunt once.

5
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:17,287
It's amazing, I'm making money
and I don't even understand

6
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,241
what Fusionics does.
- It changes the way you use energy.

7
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,641
Is that so?

8
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,884
Reader's Digest
just ran an article on it.

9
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,000
What a kidder! Science Digest.

10
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,770
Look at the time.
We're going to be late for a meeting.

11
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,242
Keep up the good work, you two.

12
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,606
Quite a team.

13
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,881
Reader's Digest, Frank! - Without your
comment, they wouldn't have noticed.

14
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:53,684
If you'd read the material I give you,
we wouldn't have to worry. - Laurel,

15
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,208
I have a life.

16
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,451
I know something and I'm not telling.
- I can make you tell.

17
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,765
You've got to be a whole lot nicer
to me. - Not really. See, watch.

18
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,130
That was nice.
All right, here it is.

19
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,524
CW is being moved up to senior VP.

20
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,288
Meaning the standard for VP
has dropped dramatically.

21
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,561
That too. Now there's
a VP spot opening. Who's next in line?

22
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,327
Who? - You know.
- Just say it.

23
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,405
You baby. You've got seniority

24
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,531
and, thanks to me, the most kills.
If we kill tonight,

25
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,125
you're in. Come on, we've got to go
in 2 minutes. Don't be late. Sally!

26
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,002
2 minutes. - Alright. Harry,
you've got those proposals for me?

27
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:44,406
Your promotion will get me more
respect in Xerox. - 2 minutes.

28
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,327
Oh wow! Tie emergency.

29
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:52,123
These clouds, this new age thing
is going to render people mute.

30
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,967
Why did you pick it?
- It was a present from Carl Bode.

31
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,966
He wouldn't even notice.
Save me.

32
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,283
Harry, those proposals.
- 30 seconds.

33
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,126
Proposals.
- Thank you.

34
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,888
And the magazine article?
- You doubt Harry?

35
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,444
Metals, depletion’s of resources,
soaring costs of mining.

36
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,842
The iron ore made me weep.

37
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,323
Okay, thanks Sweetie.

38
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,006
Sweetie.

39
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:24,486
We're late. You're wearing that?
- Yes. What are you, Mr. Blackwell?

40
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,805
I can't run home just to change.
- Never mind. It's dark there.

41
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,761
Dark? In the Huntley Club?
- We're not going there.

42
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:37,085
We're going some place much hipper.
- Fine, as long as it's quiet.

43
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,127
Don't worry, Mom.

44
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,965
You're just satisfying your need
for raw material. With ReCon Recycling

45
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:59,890
you'll cut that need 30 percent,
saving 13 million annually.

46
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,769
I say, 13 million annually.

47
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,766
How does she do it?
- I'm in love.

48
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,003
Yeah, I want to have her baby.

49
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,764
What's the payback period?

50
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:17,529
16 months. Look on page 6.
- You need numbers?

51
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:22,244
This deal's approved by Frank Peterson
and you need numbers?

52
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,085
Holy shit, look at that!
Here you go.

53
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,366
What's this?

54
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,047
I'm giving the clients what they want.
- You think Sandy wants this?

55
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,920
Trust me, it's nothing new.

56
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,681
See?

57
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,725
Another round here.

58
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,887
Do you like her breasts?
- What?

59
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,123
I might have mine done.

60
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,440
Why?
- Why not? it helps.

61
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,801
At an important meeting, show
some cleavage and see the difference.

62
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,805
Will you excuse me?

63
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,449
We need to talk.
- Now? - Now.

64
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,724
How can we do business here with them
throwing money at a naked lady?

65
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,090
This is business.
We're male-bonding like crazy.

66
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,608
It's time to go. Now.

67
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,050
Come on. You did your job,
and very well, I might add.

68
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,246
Go home. it's a done deal.
- We haven't closed yet.

69
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,644
They're flying to Chicago tomorrow.
- We'll do it on the phone. - When?

70
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,965
In the morning. - Frank,
I want to close this tonight.

71
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,920
Okay fine.
Go over there and tell them

72
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,687
it's time to go back to work.

73
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,366
Fine.
- No.

74
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:57,402
Don't do that. Just go home.
You killed them. They loved you.

75
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,126
I love you.
- You're drunk.

76
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,000
Go home. Celebrate with someone.

77
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,881
What's wrong?

78
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,721
Coming through.

79
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,407
Coming through. Coming through.

80
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:24,484
Morning, Sally. - Morning, Ms. Ayres.
- Frank in yet? - Since 8 o'clock.

81
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,402
Am I late?
- I wouldn't say that, Ms. Ayres.

82
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,886
Where is he?

83
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,042
At a staff meeting.
- A staff meeting?

84
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,488
The one Manchester called for 8:15

85
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,210
Anyway, they kept playing hard to get.
Typical dog and pony show.

86
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,251
They're concerned
about ReCon's debt and payback period.

87
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:09,326
Masters of the obvious.
I work them, I work them.

88
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,806
I hack away at their concern,
then at 3 in the morning, I close it.

89
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,131
Hell of a score, Frank.

90
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,728
Well done.
- Of course,

91
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,801
Laurel made it possible.
- Atta girl, Laurel.

92
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:29,081
Way to share the praise, Frank.
With a kill like this, all can profit.

93
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:36,409
You told me to close my deal
on the phone. - Our deal.

94
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,169
They liked it so much that they wanted
to present it to the board right away.

95
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,610
This is a big win for us. For you.

96
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,004
For your promotion. You killed.

97
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,811
Manchester was eating it up.

98
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,051
What are we fighting about?
We should celebrate.

99
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,882
What are you doing for lunch?
- Nothing.

100
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,566
Great.

101
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:02,204
Manchester asked us to buy
Anton Schuler's wedding gift.

102
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,965
We'll get it afterward.

103
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,641
Wait. Damn it! I already have a lunch.
It's too late to cancel.

104
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,361
What do I know about gifts?
Take Sally with you. She has taste.

105
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,767
Just send Sally and I can work.

106
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,131
Sally can't use the company card.
- If you don't wish me to go ...

107
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:28,047
Nonsense.
Women love shopping together.

108
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,450
Sally knows Manchester's tastes.
We all want him to be happy.

109
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,041
Right?

110
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,605
Thanks, Sweetie.

111
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,123
That's it. You go have lunch, I'll go
to the office. - I eat at the office.

112
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,568
Do you want to walk together?

113
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,721
We'll grab a cab. My treat.

114
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,370
Sorry, Ms. Ayres, I forgot my place.

115
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,411
Get a cab. I'll walk.
- What?

116
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,600
I see how you look at me,
when you look at me.

117
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,449
Like the ghost of Christmas past.
- Has Frank finally driven you nuts?

118
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,526
He's a jerk. I can deal with that.
But you treat me like a relic.

119
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,164
Me? - Like a secretary.
Like a career secretary.

120
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,244
I'm good at what I do.

121
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,690
The women's movement didn't make
it down to Wall Street.

122
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:31,165
Affirmative action didn't help me.
- It wasn't supposed to.

123
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,803
And so you're clear,
I got here by talent and hard work.

124
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,762
Ms. Ayres, would you come with me?
I want to show you something.

125
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,607
It won't take long.
Just one minute. Let me show you.

126
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,640
So? He's at lunch with Manchester.

127
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,404
I could have had
lunch with Manchester.

128
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,842
Why wasn't I invited to that lunch?

129
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,971
So much for ,'time's changing."

130
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,481
You!

131
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,647
I trained you and get promoted.

132
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,931
You got screwed.
But that shouldn't change things

133
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,243
between us. Look,

134
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:27,521
even though I'm your boss,
you should think of us as a team.

135
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,046
Should I move my desk?
The sun hits me all afternoon here.

136
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,521
What?

137
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,245
Sally!

138
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,403
I'm in a meeting!
How about some privacy?

139
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,207
I went to the mat for you.
Manchester had already decided.

140
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,083
So I should scream at Manchester?
- He's flying to London. - Convenient.

141
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,084
And confidentially,

142
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,608
he thinks
that women who get passed over

143
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,571
exhibit negative attitude.

144
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,965
Then why do the men who get
passed over turn up with an Uzi?

145
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,809
I'm your friend. - You are not.
Friends don't do this to each other.

146
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,565
You're a low-life,

147
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,450
brain-sucking pig that would sell
his mother up the river to get a deal.

148
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,569
A VP has to be a closer.

149
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,851
How? I work and you take the credit.
- I hope you've got PMS.

150
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,527
Baby, if I did, you'd be dead.

151
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,850
Can you handle the truth?
- Can you tell the truth?

152
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,766
You would never make VP.

153
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,685
It sucks, but that's how it is.

154
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,766
You're better off working for me.
I can protect you.

155
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:46,281
Frank, as my new boss,
let me tell you first: I quit.

156
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,240
It's cold out there.

157
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,205
Hi gorgeous.
- Color you Barbara!

158
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,331
It's the new me. Fabulous, hey?
- Like butter.

159
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,203
My Babes is making twice as many tips
as when I did Marilyn or Judy.

160
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,602
May they rest in peace. By the way,

161
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,211
your rent check for July and August.
I owe you for September and October.

162
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,002
It's November now. - You would have
to rain on my parade.

163
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,643
God, how the months mount up.
But Barbara never ages.

164
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,489
Well, girlfriend, I'm late for the
midnight show. 'Night, Mrs. Cupchick.

165
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:52,807
Goodnight, Barbara.
- Just talk amongst yourselves, girls.

166
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,446
You're home late.

167
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:59,289
I had a great day, so don't ruin it
for me. - Career women!

168
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,401
When you come home to an empty home,
what do you really have?

169
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,246
Independence.
- It's overrated.

170
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,564
I'm going to make some cocoa
and you're not invited.

171
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:13,407
I'll be up in 5 minutes.
Have the little marshmallows I like.

172
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,248
150,000? That's an ambitious start.
- Here's a prospectus for you

173
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,610
with the start up costs, the overheard,

174
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,331
projected business profits ...

175
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,643
Are you currently employed?

176
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,045
If I was, I wouldn't have the time
to start up a business, would I?

177
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,524
Do you have any assets?

178
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,565
I have drive, courage, and ambition.
If you look at the prospectus,

179
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,282
you'll see
a very sound business mind, too.

180
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,970
I'm talking stocks, bonds, property.

181
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:51,322
We're starting to sound
a little like a Men's Bank now.

182
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:56,004
Oh, as the Women's Bank, we should
ignore standard banking practices

183
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,129
and give you this unsecured loan

184
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,205
because you're the right gender.

185
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,931
Well, it would send a message.

186
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,926
Right, that women can't run a bank.

187
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,685
Touché.
- We have depositors to protect

188
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:16,768
just like the boy banks. I'm sorry.
We must have collateral.

189
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:25,765
I have a 6-unit apartment building
that my father left to me.

190
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:35,691
Ms. Ayres, I admire you courage,
but are you sure?

191
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,643
No, but my father
took a chance buying it

192
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,408
and I'm sure he'd like me
to take a chance on this.

193
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,929
Alright. I'll draw up the papers.

194
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,731
Thank you.

195
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,764
Hi, Lisa. it's Laurel Ayres.

196
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,087
I've got my own firm,
Laurel Ayres investments.

197
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,720
Is Mr. Anderson in?

198
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,604
We were very excited, but the
West Coast partners weren't. Sorry.

199
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,881
No,

200
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,206
I'm no longer with Manchester.
I've got my own place now.

201
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,806
Ayres investments.

202
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,685
Is Mr. Johnson in?

203
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:52,650
Hell of a piece of work, Laurel.
I was impressed but my partner wasn't.

204
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,281
I didn't know you had a partner.
- My wife.

205
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:00,607
No head for business, but she owns it
all. And she's wild in the sack.

206
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,644
You just had to read it.

207
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:12,331
What's in it for you? How about
2 tickets to the Ranger-Detroit game?

208
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,725
The one that's sold out.
I happen to have tickets.

209
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:22,360
Yes, if you let me read you
the proposal during the game.

210
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:37,045
The payments are tax deferred.
You'll have a 19.5 percent return.

211
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,968
Sounds good, Laurel.
My partners won't leave Manchester.

212
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,201
No, thanks.

213
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,330
I understand.

214
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,965
Did you look at it?
I'm sure ...

215
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,368
No, but if I could ...

216
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,521
No.

217
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,364
I understand.

218
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,644
No, what can you do
with a partner like that?

219
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,291
Alright.

220
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,286
Thank you.

221
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,971
Ms. Ayres.

222
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,206
Come in. What are you doing here?

223
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,490
Frank got your announcement.

224
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,009
What did he say?
- Oh, he ...

225
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,769
Nothing. He just laughed.
Oh this is beautiful. My gosh.

226
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,729
Just beautiful.
- So,

227
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:12,125
did Frank send you to spy on me?
- No, I wouldn't ...

228
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:16,650
I just came hoping you might ...
No, I wanted to see

229
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,771
how you were doing.
- Fabulous.

230
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:25,803
I don't even have time
to take my hair down. - Great.

231
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,810
It does that all day, all day.

232
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,731
I'll let the machine get it.

233
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,121
I can do this.

234
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,322
No, you don't need to.
- Don't worry.

235
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:50,090
Ayres investment. Mr. Carl Bode?
I'm sorry, she's in a meeting.

236
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,450
One moment, she's coming out now.

237
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,046
Ms. Ayres?

238
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,401
Carl!

239
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,085
You got it?
What did you think?

240
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:05,644
Great. And you loved it?
That's why I sent it to you.

241
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:09,886
I said who can I send this to?
Carl Bode!

242
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,490
Is it ...

243
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:19,326
Can I talk to them?
I don't mind taking a meeting.

244
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,690
Oh well, I understand.
It's fine. Yeah, no.

245
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,961
I understand.

246
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,124
Yeah. Bye-bye.

247
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,922
Isn't it funny
that all the businessmen in this city

248
00:20:54,320 --> 00:21:00,327
have partners that hate everything
that they love? isn't it amusing?

249
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,601
I'm kidding myself.
They don't have partners. They're

250
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,681
brushing me off.

251
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,681
Sal,

252
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:24,924
would you mind calling Frank and
telling him I'd like my old job back?

253
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:30,920
Sure, sure. In the meantime
you can just set your head on fire.

254
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:37,087
Who are you calling?
- Mr. Donald Fallon.

255
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,848
Fallon industries.
He's not going to see me.

256
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,969
Hello, Betty?

257
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,724
Hi, Betty, it's Sally Dugan.
I heard you were great on the lanes.

258
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,407
Oh great!

259
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,168
Betty, I need a favor
if you could manage.

260
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:58,929
Could you put Laurel Ayres
on Mr. Fallon's calendar?

261
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,051
He's booked for a month?
- Duh!

262
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,922
If you could do that for me,
it would be really great.

263
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,004
Monday night.

264
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,211
We'll take it. Monday's great.

265
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,650
Yeah, I'll see you on the lanes.
Owe you a coke. Bye-bye, Betty.

266
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,366
Okay, you're in.

267
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,807
The rest is up to you.

268
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,965
Go get 'em.

269
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:40,521
I gotta take a leak.
- Alright boys, 5 minute break.

270
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:47,209
You just can't lose.
You've got a full deck up your sleeve.

271
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:52,204
Bissel, an orange juice and soda.
- Yes, Mr. Fallon.

272
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,248
I'm Laurel Ayres.
- You're Laurel Ayres?

273
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,809
This is Laurel Ayres.
- I didn't set up the meeting.

274
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,010
He's a control freak.
That's why he's so good.

275
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,566
I have a prospectus here for you.

276
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,363
Give it to Bissel. He'll give it
to the partners. Nice meeting you.

277
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,761
No.

278
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,525
No?
- No.

279
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,490
No partners. it's for your eyes only.

280
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,851
All proposals go through the partners.
- They never read them.

281
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,651
Are you brushing me off?

282
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,726
Yes, and I thought I was nice.

283
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,211
To be honest, I thought
Laurel Ayres was a firm.

284
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,763
Two guys.
I thought I was meeting Mr. Laurel

285
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:43,688
and Mr. Ayres. Oh, the losers
are going in. I have join them.

286
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,402
I'm sorry.
- You are meeting 2 guys.

287
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:55,130
Well, I'm not a guy but my partner
is and there are two of us.

288
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,366
If it's so important, where's he now?

289
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:03,210
Away, in Asia
at the Asian Economic Summit,

290
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,887
where he's a guest speaker.

291
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:10,968
You trying to impress me?
That's good. What's his name?

292
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,721
Yes, his name.

293
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,600
They give them to babies, don't they?

294
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,685
Of course.

295
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,811
To him, too.
- Come on, Donald.

296
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,925
I'm coming.

297
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,365
By the way, I accept credit cards.

298
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,601
Cutty.

299
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:37,049
It's his name. First name Robert,
middle initial 'S', last name Cutty.

300
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,204
My partner, Robert S. Cutty.
- Never heard of him.

301
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,208
Well he's heard of you. He's concerned
about one of your companies,

302
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,045
Banff Refrigeration.

303
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:51,606
It's doing fine. - Until 1998,
when the CFC ban goes into effect.

304
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:56,609
Ban? - You'll have to convert.
But he knows a company with a device

305
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,684
that makes it unnecessary.

306
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:03,927
It would save you millions.
But you're not interested. - Wait!

307
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:08,081
I am interested. Let me see it.
- No. - What, no? Let me see it.

308
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,209
No!
- Yes.

309
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,490
Hand it over.
- Alright!

310
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:18,408
I'll read it carefully.
lf it's any good, you'll hear from me.

311
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,802
Alright. Thanks.

312
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:29,882
Damn that strange woman.
Bissel! Move your ass. Any you boys

313
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,408
heard of this guy Cutty?

314
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:37,886
Who's there? Ashley? This is Laurel.
I want to talk to Sally.

315
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,883
Frank's assistant.

316
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,810
What, you are? Where's Sally?

317
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,000
She's Harry's assistant?
Harry is an assistant.

318
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:55,485
Don't take that tone with me.
Yes, I do know the extension.

319
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,121
Goodbye.

320
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,808
Harry. I don't believe
Harry got my old job.

321
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:13,041
Mrs. Cutty? A note for Mr. Cutty.
- You've got the wrong address.

322
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,681
From Mr. Fallon.

323
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,410
He's in the bathroom.
I'll take that. Thank you.

324
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,288
Hi, I'm here to see Mr. Fallon.

325
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:44,084
Impossible. - No, it's not. My name is
Laurel Ayres. I have an appointment.

326
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,610
The only guest
Mr. Fallon has listed is Mr. Cutty.

327
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:54,289
He's my partner. I'll tell him
he's not coming. - Ms. Ayres.

328
00:26:54,680 --> 00:27:00,244
This is the Peabody Club. I'll see
if Mr. Fallon wishes to come out.

329
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:08,651
Women aren't allowed past the
lobby. Just for the last 150 years.

330
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,208
We couldn't get this far until 1989.

331
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,649
Camille Scott,
Mr. Fallon's personal broker.

332
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:19,045
Camille, you look incredible.
- I knew I would be seeing you.

333
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,284
Nice to see you,
but where's Mr. Cutty?

334
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:28,009
Stuck in a meeting.
- More important than this? - Call him

335
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:33,770
and tell him he's got 5 minutes.
- I can't do that.

336
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:37,130
It's not that
he's in a meeting, meeting.

337
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,931
Really?

338
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:43,928
The fact of the matter is ...
I can't ...

339
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,685
Stop.

340
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,443
I don't jerk people around.
I want to do business with Mr. Cutty.

341
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,287
Even though I'm under no obligation,

342
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,524
I'm giving him a full commission.

343
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,762
This means you ...
- Bought the entire company.

344
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,926
You tell Mr. Cutty
to be at my office at 9 am tomorrow.

345
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,010
I ... look ...

346
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:17,640
I don't want to lie to you.
He doesn't really ...

347
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,408
He's not ...
- Tell him

348
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,849
that Donald Fallon doesn't do
business with people he's never met.

349
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,841
But, Mr. Fallon, you just did.

350
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,887
Thank you.

351
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,166
Damn.

352
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:48,560
Okay, Mr. Cutty,
time to bring you to life.

353
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,681
Nice.

354
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,045
Mr. Cutty.

355
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,929
Date of birth?

356
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:15,724
October 29, 1929 is perfect.
Black Thursday.

357
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:21,126
A financial world crashes,
a new savior is born.

358
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,966
I really like you, Mr. Cutty.

359
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,724
67,
so where have you been all this time?

360
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:34,087
You should have retired.
Living in Switzerland.

361
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,522
You made a fortune
and then you left. Now you're back.

362
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,087
Where are you?

363
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:45,811
At the Plaza. Such good taste.

364
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:52,050
Oh yes, jock,
because you play polo.

365
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:56,288
You're a big game hunter,
because you're such a man.

366
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,285
What about your wife? Married?
Widower? No.

367
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:05,685
We'd have to dig up the wife.
Never married.

368
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:11,883
Just 67, so why ...
He's searching for one true love.

369
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,806
But he hasn't found it yet.

370
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,647
Not the stuff of a business partner
but he's a bit different.

371
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:22,681
That's cool. Net worth?

372
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:28,007
They want to know everything.
What's your net worth, Mr. Cutty?

373
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,606
Unknown.

374
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:34,529
Cup of coffee, Mr. Cutty?
You look a little pale.

375
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,846
Caucasian

376
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,046
I got you a present.

377
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,650
As a thanks for the Fallon meeting.
He bought the proposal.

378
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,082
Now I've got offices, a new partner.
Stationery. - A partner?

379
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,811
It's no big deal.

380
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,721
You didn't have to do this.
Thank you.

381
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,721
Thanks.

382
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:13,484
If there's ever anything
I could do for you, just call.

383
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,366
And thanks again.

384
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,769
I need a job.
- What? You have one already.

385
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:30,087
It's a dead-end job. You
and your partner need an assistant.

386
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,724
If the company grows, there's room
for advancement. - You know,

387
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,164
my partner does all the hiring.

388
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,401
Set up a meeting for me.

389
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,451
That's kind of difficult.

390
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,171
Why?

391
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:52,408
He's got somebody he wants
to work with and I don't want

392
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,371
to step on his feet.
- You, of all people!

393
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,330
What do you mean?

394
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:01,964
What?
- I want you, but my partner doesn't.

395
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,807
That's not a brush off.

396
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:09,089
It's a little one.
Why do you want to work for us?

397
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:14,611
We're a tiny company.
- Gosh, I've watched you for 5 years.

398
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,482
I know how you work.
No one's like you. You're so good.

399
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:22,368
And you don't know this,
but there's nobody better than me.

400
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,006
We don't have much money.

401
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,084
I'll take it.

402
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,529
Okay, you're hired.

403
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:44,047
Wait until you see Mr. Cutty's office.
- My gosh. - Put your stuff down.

404
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:51,322
Not really my taste,
but what's a girl to do?

405
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,201
It's so beautiful.

406
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,046
It's so beautiful.
- I'll tell him.

407
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:02,002
And the fireplace. My.
Did he shoot that rhino?

408
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:06,689
It's possible. He travels so much
and brings lots back.

409
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:13,164
My gosh, he knows
all those famous people?

410
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,449
Enough to open a deli.

411
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,729
I can't wait to see your office.

412
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,800
My office? Well,

413
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,410
I don't exactly have one per se.
So I'll just be using this one.

414
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,849
There's only one desk.

415
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,200
Is there a problem?
- No problem. it's just ...

416
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,530
It's beautiful.

417
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,568
How did you meet him?

418
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,041
Who?

419
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,646
Mr. Cutty.

420
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,803
He read one of my proposals.
- How did he get it?

421
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,964
I don't know. He got it from somebody.

422
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:01,241
He made some amazing changes
and we worked on it over the weekend.

423
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,207
I like the name Cutty. it's strong.

424
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,807
Yeah, better than Wild Turkey.

425
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:19,284
I thought I saw somebody.
No, it's him. Aesop Franklin.

426
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:24,767
Seriously, his name is Aesop?
What's he do?

427
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:28,721
Don't you read
Omni magazine? He's only the CEO

428
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,690
of Syntonex.

429
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:34,402
Here he comes. What's he doing here?

430
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,802
Don't look.

431
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,480
He's a CEO? - He started
a software business in his basement.

432
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,527
He should get out more.

433
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:52,369
Mr. Jacobson, I'm sorry I'm late.

434
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:56,242
I looked in and didn't think
this would be the place ...

435
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,201
Get your coat.

436
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,444
The food hasn't come.
- It doesn't matter.

437
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:06,402
We haven't eaten yet.
- Get your coat on. Come on.

438
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,162
Did we ...

439
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,801
Put it on!

440
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:17,727
What do you want? - Don't you get it?
Aesop Franklin and Randall Jacobson!

441
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:22,409
The president of Hewlett Packard's
PC division. - So?

442
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:27,806
Do you know what it means? Hewlett
Packard is taking over Syntonex.

443
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,329
How do you know that?
- Look where they're meeting.

444
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:36,123
So? - Someplace
where no one is going to see them.

445
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,124
We saw them.
- Yes, we did.

446
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,131
We saw them.
- Yes, we saw them.

447
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:49,650
So who do I tell? Someone who'll blab,
someone with a big ...

448
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,042
Oh, I know who.

449
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:01,166
You can trust me, Laurel.
Discretion is my creed.

450
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,005
It's written all over you.

451
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:08,004
Let's face it, men like doing business
with men. - That's right.

452
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,371
But they want to sleep with us.
That's our power.

453
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:18,130
Why doesn't Cutty buy the stock
himself? - Personal reasons.

454
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:23,920
I should meet with him first,
and see what he likes.

455
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:29,168
To be perfectly honest,
he really likes Syntonex.

456
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:33,042
Syntonex?
That stock is in free-fall.

457
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,729
Their marketing and distribution are
a joke and they're way in debt.

458
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:43,160
It'd be a miracle if the stock moved
up. - Mr. Cutty likes miracles.

459
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:49,126
I trust this will remain between us?
- Laurel, I'm a professional.

460
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,971
I know.

461
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:56,809
Syntonex stock is still climbing.
- I read the papers.

462
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,410
What about Cutty? - I had to dig
but I did find this file here.

463
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,564
Give it to me inside.

464
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,801
Everything okay out there?
- Yes, thanks.

465
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,481
Ms. Ayres,
when can I meet Mr. Cutty?

466
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,844
Probably never.

467
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,451
Never?
- Not never ever,

468
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:25,208
just not ever.
He's a real globetrotter.

469
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,930
Doesn't he ever trot to New York?

470
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:35,246
Of course. He just left. But,
with faxes and phones, why bother?

471
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,361
Mr. Fallon!

472
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,969
Good morning, Ms. Ayres.
- Nice to see you again.

473
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:47,486
Is Cutty in? - He's never in.
- This early. He's never in

474
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,245
this early.

475
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:54,846
Sally, you can go.
- My desk is here. - Of course.

476
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:00,245
It's where ... Come with me
into Mr. Cutty's office. - Thank you.

477
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:06,045
Congratulations on Syntonex.
- You weren't supposed to tell anyone.

478
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,727
You know how this town is.
- I'm learning.

479
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:13,330
Why didn't he tell his friends?
- His friends are also his clients.

480
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,882
And you're still with Manchester.

481
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:20,010
He knows Barbara Streisand?
- They dated.

482
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,931
By the way, Mr. Cutty wants
you to sell his Syntonex shares at 54.

483
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:28,927
54? Most analysts predict
it will peak in the 60s.

484
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:32,370
Mr. Cutty
isn't like most analysts, is he?

485
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,490
Ms. Ayres.
- Yes?

486
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:40,403
I'm ready to throw a lot of money
Cutty's way, my money.

487
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,280
He just needs to meet with us.

488
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,887
We spoke about it. it's not possible.

489
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,364
However,
I could cancel my 10 am.

490
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:55,322
I just might fly down to Florida and
crash his meeting with Harley Mason.

491
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:58,530
You know about it?
- Harley called me to gloat.

492
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,647
Not for long. Mr. Cutty
can't make that meeting either.

493
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:07,250
I'm in charge.
- Really? What's your handicap?

494
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:13,968
I don't play golf.
- Harley goes to Florida to play golf.

495
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,926
He only talks business
on the back 9.

496
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:23,640
Have Cutty call me. Have a nice trip.
Come on, Bissel, move your ass.

497
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,851
I'll take this one.

498
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:54,440
At the back 9, you disappear.
I want to speak to Cutty alone.

499
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,087
Mr. Mason.

500
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,370
Laurel Ayres, Mr. Cutty's partner.
Unfortunately he's been tied up

501
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,843
in Bangkok,
but he did send a replacement.

502
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,281
You?

503
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:12,201
I'm the queen of the windmill hole.
I do that well, but ... Johnny.

504
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,602
Johnny Miller!
- Mind if I tag along?

505
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,245
Hell no. And I won't even mention
how much I lost when you won

506
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:27,008
at Pebble Beach in 1994.
- Sorry about that.

507
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:31,121
Let me win a few holes
so I can brag a little later.

508
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:36,560
You boys have a good time.
We'll talk about the proposal later.

509
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,249
Ms. Ayres, consider it sold.

510
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:47,727
No? - You tell Robert Cutty
that he's in a class by himself.

511
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:52,401
Ain't he though?
Get going. Johnny's waiting.

512
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,211
Hit a couple of them for me.

513
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,841
Oops, excuse me.

514
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:10,805
Donald, you're a friend and I must warn you.
Nobody knows who this Cutty is.

515
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,168
He bought Syntonex
before it went up

516
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:19,010
and sold it, one point before it went
down. Now he has Harley Mason.

517
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:23,450
Lucky shot.
Look who he chose for a partner.

518
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,365
I fired her!

519
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,845
I wouldn't spread it around.
Sorry, Walter.

520
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,244
That's how the cookie crumbles.

521
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,766
If Donald Fallon leaves,
others will follow.

522
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:41,926
Get something on Cutty
or get us into bed with him.

523
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:46,120
The buzz from Wall Street:
move over Dean Witter,

524
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:52,209
step aside Walter Manchester.
There's a new bull in town

525
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,887
and his name is Robert Cutty.

526
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,329
Cindy Mason, the New York Post.

527
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,963
Thank you for your faith.
Mr. Cutty won't let you down.

528
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:05,523
When will he contact us?
- Probably never.

529
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,811
He only calls when something goes
wrong. No one ever hears from him.

530
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:13,249
I see.
Thank you, Laurel. Gentlemen.

531
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,569
So tired ...

532
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:27,491
You can't relax quite yet.

533
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:31,282
3 more Cindy Mason readers
are due in a half hour.

534
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,604
Alright, I'll have to get out the box.

535
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,161
The box?

536
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,564
The one with all my great ideas
that Manchester hated.

537
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:43,084
Oh, that box. I got rid of it.

538
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,687
It was so cluttered in the closet.
- You what?

539
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,807
I got rid of it.
- Go get it.

540
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:52,562
It's in the garbage.
- You throw away my box

541
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:57,841
with all the great ideas that Cutty
and I loved and Manchester hated?

542
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,210
I put it all in here.
- What?

543
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,891
All your files are in a program
that I designed. it's cataloged,

544
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:10,046
categorized, cross-categorized,
indexed, and referenced.

545
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:14,131
The box is in here?
- Yes.

546
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,044
This is great.

547
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,968
Who knew you had it in you?
- I did.

548
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:29,045
You were wasted on Frank.
- Yes.

549
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:34,208
Cutty Ayres. One moment, Miss Scott.
It's that woman for Mr. Cutty.

550
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:41,606
Laurel, I wanted to speak with Robert.

551
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,528
You missed him. He was in
Washington. Now he's off to the Pope.

552
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,243
The Pope depends on his advice.

553
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,161
Really?

554
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:56,848
I wanted to thank him for the flowers.
- He sent you flowers?

555
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,844
You didn't know?
- No.

556
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:03,566
I can't know everything
that goes on here. What, Sally?

557
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:08,522
Wait. I'm sorry, I've got to go.
Robert's on the other other line ...

558
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:12,562
Tell him I'm on the line.
- Bye-bye.

559
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,051
That woman!

560
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:23,165
This is fabulous. Incredible.

561
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:27,121
It's amazing. You're a find!

562
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:32,724
Would you tell Mr. Cutty?
- Yes, sure.

563
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,170
Pope.

564
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,241
Mr. Carter?

565
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,484
Frank Peterson
from Manchester Investments.

566
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,085
I understand. I'll get to the point.
Robert Cutty.

567
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:54,641
I was wondering if you've had
any contact with him abroad.

568
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:58,484
His company is small.

569
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:02,769
I can't find anyone
who has met him.

570
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:21,965
He's very weird.

571
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:25,364
Eccentric.
He won't take meetings.

572
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,168
C-U-T-T-Y.

573
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,209
I think it's spelled like the Scotch.

574
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,882
His phone number?

575
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:42,725
I understand you have a reservation.
It will be at least 20 minutes.

576
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:48,411
It's just a fad. Cutty will crash
and take his clients with him.

577
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,326
Excuse me.

578
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:55,807
I'm here with Donald Trump.
How long is it going to be?

579
00:46:56,200 --> 00:47:00,728
I have checks on two tables.
Ms. Ayres. How nice to see you.

580
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,482
Mr. Cutty's usual table.

581
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:14,322
Sorry, Frank. I'm going
to crash and burn with Cutty. Call me.

582
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,289
Hello, welcome aboard.
Please fasten your seat belt.

583
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,771
Aesop Franklin, right?
How was your stockholders' meeting

584
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:37,928
at Hewlett Packard?

585
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,363
Do I know you?
- No.

586
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:45,810
Laurel Ayres with Cutty Ayres
investments. We talk about you often.

587
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,521
You need some investment counseling.

588
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:51,726
I don't understand ...

589
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:56,291
You're selling your company.
You can't put all that money

590
00:47:56,680 --> 00:48:00,082
in a savings account.
- There's the misunderstanding.

591
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,131
There's no money. Just a job.

592
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,163
What, no money?
You do this for a lousy job?

593
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:11,929
The job's not lousy, the deal's lousy.
- Why are you doing it?

594
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:14,721
I have to.
- You have to?

595
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,609
Syntonex is ...

596
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:20,241
bankrupt.

597
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:27,449
Bankrupt. The only way to save it
is to give it away.

598
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:30,641
You can't just give away a company.

599
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:38,246
Imagine that you have a company
and you really love it.

600
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:44,249
It's your whole life. Right?
But your company is dying.

601
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:48,962
There may be another way to save it.

602
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:54,366
I know someone you should talk to.
Robert Cutty. - Robert Cutty?

603
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:59,011
Who are you? - Laurel Ayres.
- Laurel, I'm Aesop ...

604
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:02,768
Franklin. - Yeah.
- Page 15. - Robert Cutty.

605
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:06,090
If anybody can save it, he can.

606
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:11,006
Sally, I'm back.
- Welcome, welcome.

607
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,561
Sally, Aesop. Aesop, Sally.

608
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:15,722
Hello.

609
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:21,001
I wanted to go home, but ...
- Cutty's going to save his company.

610
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:24,449
Did any files arrive for me today?
- I think so.

611
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:27,889
On your desk.
- Very good, thank you.

612
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,401
Come on.

613
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:43,251
These are your files?
- It's a mess, huh?

614
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:49,283
Anything alive in there? - Hopeless,
I know. I can't run a company.

615
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,041
I can't even run a bath.

616
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:56,729
What if Hewlett Packard finds out?
I'll lose everything.

617
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,009
Aesop, sit down.

618
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,210
Sit down?
- Sit! Sally, come for a second.

619
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:09,284
I have a challenge for your program.
Will it be a problem?

620
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:17,124
No problem. - Really?
- Maybe a little one.

621
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:22,008
That envelop on top,
you have to RSVP by this evening.

622
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:27,361
Mr. Fallon invites you and Mr. Cutty
to his Thanksgiving charity ball.

623
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:31,128
It's black tie.
Unless you're a pilgrim.

624
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:39,526
Everybody
in the financial world will be there.

625
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:43,561
Good. Very good. Aesop!

626
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:50,167
If you come as my date, you can meet
the movers and shakers.

627
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:55,168
Okay, I love black tie parties.
Even I look good.

628
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:57,130
I'm sure you do.

629
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,081
Alrighty then.

630
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:02,891
Thank you, Sally.

631
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:24,927
No business like show business.
So girlfriend, what look this time?

632
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:29,928
I don't know, Charlie. All those
big wigs from Wall Street are there.

633
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:34,211
The slut look never failed.
- I have to look intelligent, too.

634
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,364
I'm representing Robert Cutty.

635
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,205
Slutty, yet intelligent.

636
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:44,691
News anchor.

637
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,689
Now this is giving thanks.

638
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:17,924
Don't leave me alone with all them.
- You're crushing my hand.

639
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:20,402
Shall we go in?

640
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:22,531
Are you alright?

641
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,447
A very profitable merger.
Arigato.

642
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:29,927
Ms. Ayres. Excuse me.

643
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:35,724
My money was never in prettier hands.
- And had a better rate of return.

644
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:40,848
Cutty is amazing. No doubt.
The governor knows him from Wharton.

645
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:43,322
He's never mentioned it.

646
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:47,850
Where is Robert?
He wrote me saying he was coming.

647
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:51,801
He's stuck in Bangladesh,
so he won't be here, but

648
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:58,242
I've got someone equally brilliant.
Aesop Franklin, CEO of Syntonex.

649
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,610
Not any more.
Congratulations on the sale.

650
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:06,001
Mr. Cutty may end up
disappointing Hewlett Packard.

651
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:12,484
I'm intrigued. Camille,
get Mr. Franklin a drink.

652
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,287
I love your tux.
- Laurel.

653
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:17,886
Go ahead.

654
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:22,331
Tell me more.
- Robert seems to think

655
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:26,361
that if left independent
Syntonex can be a money machine.

656
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:30,162
He knows about the mess it's in?
- He's fixed worse ones.

657
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:33,962
Cutty is going to reorganize it?

658
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:37,045
Personally?
- And oversee it's management.

659
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:38,681
He's that sure?

660
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:45,448
He's putting his own money in, until
he finds a few, select investors.

661
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:52,323
I'll talk to a few people.
I'll be back. - I know you will.

662
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:07,610
Laurel Ayres? Cindy Mason,
I write a little column.

663
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,163
I loved what you wrote
about Mr. Cutty. Thank you.

664
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:16,043
Thanks. I'm flattered. I'd love
to write your fascinating story.

665
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:18,647
Really? Now I'm flattered.

666
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:24,962
A young woman starts at the bottom
and stays there

667
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:29,570
only to wind up the partner of the
most-talked about man on Wall Street.

668
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:33,203
Sounds like fiction.
- The best stories always do.

669
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:35,489
When I tell them.

670
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:41,762
Of course, I'd have to talk
to Mr. Cutty, in person.

671
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:45,364
To tell my story?

672
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:49,367
A perfect arrangement, isn't it?
- Not so perfect.

673
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,569
Mr. Cutty doesn't speak to the press.

674
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:53,929
Nice to meet you.
- Laurel,

675
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:57,449
it doesn't pay not to talk to Cindy.

676
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:02,885
I like your do.
- Do you?

677
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,484
I do, too.

678
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:18,091
I'm a little shy,
so don't leave me alone. Wow, Laurel!

679
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:20,682
You look great. What happened?

680
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:25,483
It happens to women who leave bad
relationships. - Come on.

681
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:30,249
Let's be friends. Dance with me.
I've got news for you.

682
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:33,484
And I'm not saying anything,
unless we can dance.

683
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:38,010
Dance faster, you make my skin crawl.
- I've missed your sense of humor.

684
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:42,724
Here it is.
Manchester wants you back.

685
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:48,490
Really? Did they discover
that your ideas were actually mine?

686
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,962
He respects you. Always has.

687
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:57,127
He wants you to be senior VP.
- VP? Senior?

688
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,763
You'd be one of the
highest-ranking women in business.

689
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:03,925
And your boss, Frank.

690
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:05,970
I'd move up, too.

691
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:09,923
Just think,
Manchester and Cutty together.

692
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:12,322
We'd own Wall Street.

693
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:16,965
Forget it, baby.
Manchester doesn't get Cutty or me.

694
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:20,330
If it's not Manchester,
it'll be someone else.

695
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:24,009
Everyone wants Cutty.
And without him, you're nothing.

696
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:30,764
You know, Frank,
I can afford to have you killed.

697
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:33,763
Is that a no?

698
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:40,565
Should we check your portfolio?
- Don't you dare!

699
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:46,806
Did you know
about this Interlink software?

700
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,965
It's revolutionary.
- We know.

701
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:52,647
Check this out.

702
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:02,169
Laurel, we have to meet
Cutty on this. In person.

703
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:06,804
Robert Cutty, in person. You get it?
- I'll try.

704
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:11,649
He's not into personal meetings.
I'll do my best.

705
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:13,849
That's not enough.

706
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:17,687
All I want is when and where.

707
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:23,405
I'll call him and see what I can do.
Then I'll call you.

708
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:38,642
Have you seen the paper?
This Cindy Mason. This trash.

709
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:42,442
The cow didn't even mention me.
- Is it true about the affairs?

710
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:45,320
I thought
Mr. Cutty was searching for true love.

711
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:51,366
He's a man. That's how they search.
- Something happen yesterday? - To me?

712
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:55,970
What could have happened?
Nobody wanted me, only Cutty.

713
00:57:56,360 --> 00:58:01,651
The guy is a pain in my behind.
I regret the day I ever made him up,

714
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,763
him a part of my life.

715
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:11,051
As if I had nothing to do
with Cutty Ayres. Like I didn't exist.

716
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:15,525
Okay, let's go back 2 months.

717
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:18,203
Yes, 2 months B.C.

718
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:20,481
B.C.?

719
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,724
Before Cutty.

720
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:26,085
You don't have enough to do, do you?

721
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:32,888
Before Cutty, you had no job,
no prospects, and a big debt.

722
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:36,723
Minor details.
- Even you call him a genius.

723
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:42,604
He's as elusive as Howard Hughes,
and you give him all the credit.

724
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:47,369
So he gets a little respect.
- You got what you wanted.

725
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:49,649
Thank you.
- Now what's

726
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:53,044
this secret Cutty meeting?
- You don't want to know.

727
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:57,968
CNN called, The Times called. 
Cindy Mason offered me $1000

728
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:03,400
for the location.
- Cindy Mason offered you $1000

729
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,131
for the location?

730
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:07,481
Yeah.

731
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:12,570
Call her and tell her you'll take it.

732
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:14,247
What?

733
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:17,849
Take her money
and the money from everyone else, too!

734
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:21,881
What are you planning?

735
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:26,326
I'm going to prepare a whammy.

736
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:36,841
What's with Cutty?
- My feet are killing me.

737
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:43,091
If that camera touches my hair again,
you'll be sending from your bowels.

738
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:51,930
Hello darling, how are you?
I thought it was secret. - So did I.

739
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:58,927
The door's locked.
- Robert, please!

740
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:01,049
Come on. It's him.

741
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:04,683
They're here for you, Robert. Robert!

742
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:15,767
Leave him alone! You should know
better, Cindy! - Oh please!

743
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:20,130
Who does Cutty think he is,
standing us up like this?

744
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:24,844
Preposterous. I thought we'd see him
finally. - A waste of time.

745
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:30,007
Somehow the press found out.
He couldn't come through that throng.

746
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:33,563
How can he run a company?

747
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:38,244
You wanted Mr. Cutty- He's right here.
His ideas are right in front of you.

748
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:40,130
Thank you.

749
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:45,003
I'm sure it's fascinating,
but Frank's right. Without Cutty

750
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:48,085
I'm going to have to pass.
- I agree.

751
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,721
Bissel, my coat.
- I tried.

752
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:53,043
My conscience is clear.

753
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:55,041
What?

754
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:58,131
I told Robert,
these are important men.

755
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:02,809
Some are clients. We made promises.

756
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:07,688
We have a moral obligation to them.

757
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:11,323
Wait. You mean that Cutty ...

758
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:17,046
He ran the numbers and wants to keep
Syntonex for himself. I'm sorry.

759
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,085
This is bullshit.

760
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:25,122
Yeah. Tell Mr. Manchester that
you told Mr. Fallon not to do this.

761
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:30,447
Mr. Fallon, I didn't say that.
- Shut up, Frank. Just calm yourself.

762
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:33,002
I don't want you to ...

763
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:36,447
Control yourself.
Gentlemen,

764
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:39,207
turn to page 1.
Let's begin to read.

765
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:42,009
Donald, I'm so sorry.
- It's alright.

766
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,402
Syntonex consolidated financial ...

767
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:48,122
Page 2 is better.
- Page 2.

768
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:56,091
Come on, Bissel. Move you ass.

769
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:05,005
Problems, Frank? Trouble in paradise?

770
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:14,330
What happened?

771
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:16,841
What happened?

772
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:19,641
They went for it.

773
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:27,408
Come on. I've got a surprise.

774
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,411
We all pitched in and

775
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:44,691
got something to show our gratitude.

776
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:49,364
I hope Mr. Cutty smokes cigars.

777
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,448
Tell Mr. Cutty thanks, thanks

778
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:55,411
for saving our jobs.

779
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:03,564
This is my favorite time of the year.

780
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:07,806
When I was a kid, every Christmas
my dad gave me a rail road ticket.

781
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:09,804
One way?

782
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:11,201
No.

783
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:17,323
He'd buy a ticket for him and for me.
We'd take the train and go somewhere.

784
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:22,848
Once we ended up in Cleveland.
He managed to make it wonderful.

785
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:25,688
You don't still do that?
- No.

786
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:31,280
He passed away.
Every Christmas I light a candle.

787
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:37,491
That's a great story. Thank you.

788
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:43,164
Can you handle another story?
- Sure.

789
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:56,481
Robert Cutty doesn't exist.

790
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:03,608
You don't understand.
I made him up.

791
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,729
I've known that for weeks.

792
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:10,689
What? For weeks?

793
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:16,007
Sure. Every idea Cutty had
was already in your files

794
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:18,971
or I saw you come up with it.

795
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:22,128
Why didn't you say anything?

796
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:26,411
And stop getting
those great gifts. No!

797
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:31,362
I loved it.
If you had to make up a white male

798
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:34,684
so people would recognize your talent,

799
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:39,847
it was my job
to keep the illusion going

800
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:44,882
and support you.
- You knew and didn't say a thing!

801
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:48,329
Yeah, sure.
- You're something else.

802
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:49,721
Oh, thanks.

803
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:54,641
When I take over Syntonex,
I'm going to need somebody

804
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:59,841
to help me organize and run
the company. interested?

805
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:03,805
Are you kidding?
- No.

806
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:06,771
Yes.
- Yes? Is that a yes?

807
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:11,886
Nice little yes dance. Okay!

808
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:23,762
This will flush out Cutty.
- I know someone who could help out.

809
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:26,731
I thought so.
- A friend at the SEC.

810
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:32,889
I'll have Eddie on Laurel's tail,
24 hours a day. - incognito.

811
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:34,850
Great.

812
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:39,325
Agent Thompkins, Frank Peterson.
I thought you might be interested

813
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:44,123
in Cindy Mason's column
before it's published tomorrow.

814
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:46,723
Morning, Sally.

815
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:49,851
Be right there, Ms. Ayres.
- Great.

816
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:54,968
You made me feel so much better,
I had to go shopping.

817
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:58,489
For you. Merry Christmas.

818
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:03,408
Agent Thompkins of the SEC
is waiting to meet Mr. Cutty.

819
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:11,324
Agent Thompkins. How are you?
I'm Laurel Ayres.

820
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:13,927
How can I help you?

821
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:19,804
I'd like to see Mr. Cutty.
- Who wouldn't. He's not available.

822
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:24,728
I'll tell him you were here.
- Wasn't Aesop Franklin your date

823
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:29,728
at Donald Fallon's Thanksgiving party?
- Yes, is that illegal?

824
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:33,889
I'm sure Mr. Cutty can explain it.

825
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:36,169
See that he gets this.

826
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:38,446
A judicial subpoena?

827
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:40,251
Because I'm in a picture

828
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:44,725
with Aesop Franklin? - Well, Mr. Cutty
did profit personally from Syntonex.

829
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:49,045
But he didn't do anything illegal.
- He can clear that up when we meet.

830
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:51,681
If he doesn't cooperate,

831
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:56,605
I'm afraid we'll have to conduct
a full-scale investigation.

832
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,081
Happy holidays.

833
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:08,004
This isn't even close to rational.
- Charlie is my only shot.

834
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:13,201
What if you just told the truth?
- Are you crazy? it's fraud!

835
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:15,921
They'll throw me in jail.
This is insane.

836
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:20,769
If I had just closed the Syntonex
deal, it would have been fine.

837
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:22,730
Merry Christmas.

838
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:27,489
Is Santa following us? - Don't get
paranoid. I've got big fish to fry.

839
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:30,531
Come on.
- He's following us.

840
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:33,924
This is crazy.

841
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:38,166
This is nuts.
- Not that door, this one.

842
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:44,404
Hello, ladies.

843
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:49,004
What is it now?
- I need a new look.

844
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:51,607
That's what I live for.
- I hope so.

845
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:57,006
Distinguished,
rich, powerful, old, and

846
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:59,971
male.
- Now it's getting interesting.

847
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:02,370
White.

848
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:06,009
White?
- He's gotta be white. - Oh shit.

849
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:09,324
This is crazy.
- You got a better idea?

850
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:13,486
Charlie can work miracles.
- I could use one right now.

851
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:15,291
I'm on.

852
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:21,287
Slip into Ethel. Let the sand out
of the tits. I'll be right back.

853
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:24,766
May I never get this old.

854
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:36,241
My name is Robert Cutty.
- Deeper. A few octaves.

855
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:41,649
My name is Robert Cutty.
- Deeper. - My name is ...

856
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:45,203
Deeper! - Any deeper,
I'll be talking out of my uterus.

857
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:46,761
More male attitude.

858
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:50,246
Alright.

859
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:56,091
Bob Cutty, and I'm going to bite
your booty in my truck. - Male,

860
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:58,209
not moron.

861
01:08:58,720 --> 01:08:59,721
Done.

862
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:06,282
Will this fool the SEC?
- Wow. It's a miracle.

863
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:10,366
Before I go on stage,
I try out my new look in public.

864
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:12,967
In public?
- In public.

865
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:16,682
Mr. Cutty? Of course!

866
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:22,120
He can expect the very best.
Without notice. Confidentiality?

867
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:24,040
Madam, this is the Plaza.

868
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:27,683
And Cutty?
- Fallon will approach him at the SEC.

869
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:32,051
So Hewlett Packard is in?
- They're in, if Fallon is in.

870
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:36,001
Jacobson will tell him at dinner.
- At the Plaza.

871
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:39,962
His favorite place.
- Nice work, Frank.

872
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:46,367
Charlotte, Mr. Cutty is on his way.
Inspect the royal suite. Simon.

873
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:51,124
Fresh flowers in the suite. Take them
from our other guests, if needed.

874
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:54,967
José, our best champagne and caviar.

875
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:59,885
Thomas, out front. You're there
for Mr. Cutty alone. Go on!

876
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:01,846
Wait!

877
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:05,564
Our guests' privacy is sacred.

878
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:16,771
Lily at the business desk.

879
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:22,327
Good evening, Randall.
You remember Walter. - Hello.

880
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:25,121
Fallon's meeting us in the Palm Court.

881
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:32,731
Camille? it's me, Tommy.
Guess who's coming to town?

882
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:36,602
Ms. Mason, Frederick from the Plaza.

883
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:39,091
He's coming.

884
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:46,564
Hello, my name is Robert Cutty.

885
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:50,928
Is that you, Mr. Cutty?

886
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:55,164
Hello, I am Robert Cutty.

887
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:57,085
Can I get your bags, Sir?

888
01:10:57,480 --> 01:11:01,246
I'm not staying long enough
to need any. Excuse me.

889
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:02,971
Got you.

890
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:06,485
Yes, I did.
- All the flowers in place?

891
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:08,405
Champagne, caviar?

892
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:11,531
Can I get your coat for you,
Mr. Cutty? - No.

893
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:18,011
Welcome to the Plaza. Frederick,
the manager. We're deeply honored.

894
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:23,122
If there's anything I can do
to make your stay more pleasant,

895
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:27,605
please call me personally.
- I just want to get to my room.

896
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,731
I have seen to every amenity.

897
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:36,168
Tony, you heard of that Cutty?
Guess what, he's here!

898
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:39,884
Cutty? Robert Cutty here?

899
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:45,127
Maybe he'd join us,
and we could finish this tonight.

900
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:47,250
Ms. Ayres ...

901
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:52,603
asked that all charges
be on her account. - Excuse me,

902
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:56,931
I'm looking for Robert Cutty.
- Well, Cutty.

903
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:00,245
I'll find my room myself.

904
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:02,520
Thomas!

905
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:07,290
Can you help me? I'm looking ...
- Don't hesitate to call me.

906
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:11,208
It's a private elevator.

907
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:18,410
If something's not okay, call Thomas
the bellhop. - Thanks.

908
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:23,727
I won't say goodnight,
because I know it'll be great.

909
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,001
Robert.

910
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:37,846
It's me,

911
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:39,287
Camille.

912
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:41,320
Camille?

913
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:50,761
How did you get in here?
- I just bribed a bellhop.

914
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:54,527
What do you want?

915
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:57,241
You said you couldn't wait to meet me?
- Yes, I did, but ...

916
01:12:57,640 --> 01:13:00,928
Disappointed?
- No, but you must be.

917
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:04,369
Not at all.
You're drop dead gorgeous.

918
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:13,163
You're a genius.
All geniuses are gorgeous.

919
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:17,963
You think I'm a genius?
- I knew it when I saw the Banff idea.

920
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:22,445
But the Syntonex deal
knocked me off my feet.

921
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:24,604
It was luminous, insightful,

922
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,809
brilliant!

923
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:32,240
And those notes! A woman waits
a lifetime for them! - I know.

924
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:34,921
Just sit there.

925
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,684
I don't ...
- Robert?

926
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:41,886
No, Camille.

927
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:44,567
Not the skirt, Camille.

928
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:48,849
La Perla.

929
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:53,168
You're a man of the world.
I want you, Robert.

930
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,800
I want your genius.
Feel me with your genius.

931
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:07,008
My hips.
- I'll help you.

932
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:09,841
Stop that!

933
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:14,161
Isn't that what you want?
- No, and you shouldn't either.

934
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:20,841
You're intelligent and beautiful.
You want to get ahead. Use your brain!

935
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:27,808
I've never heard that before.
- I'm not surprised.

936
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:31,085
I'm shaking. Hold me!

937
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:35,725
No. I don't want to hold you.
Look, Camille,

938
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:40,131
it's not what's down here
that's important,

939
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:42,966
it's what's up here.

940
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:48,042
Think about it.
And get yourself together.

941
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:53,171
I'm pleased that you wanted to be
with me. Good evening.

942
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,968
What a man!

943
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:05,968
I really want to do business with you,
but I need the room number.

944
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:11,530
Is he with anyone else?
- I'm not at liberty to say.

945
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:14,969
Mr. Frederick, what room is he in?

946
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:26,121
That's confidential.

947
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:30,924
Oh my God.

948
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:32,526
If you know what I'm ...

949
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:36,085
Shit.

950
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:05,528
Excuse me, Mr. Cutty,

951
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:09,970
Sorry to bother you. Frank
Peterson from Manchester Investments.

952
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:12,887
Walter Manchester and I

953
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:17,046
are having dinner
with Donald Fallon to discuss you.

954
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:19,289
Shit! Mr. Cutty,

955
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:28,049
I don't know
what Laurel Ayres said about me ...

956
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:47,202
My car.
- You're going so soon?

957
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:50,683
Frank, you stupid jerk.
Cutty's getting away.

958
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:54,325
Mr. Cutty needs his car right away.

959
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:58,486
Do you see him?

960
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:18,644
Mr. Cutty? Donald Fallon. Get in!

961
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:21,247
From the frying pan into the fryer.

962
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:32,285
The press treats you
like a rock star.

963
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:34,682
How about a good cigar?

964
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:39,811
Thanks.
- I was going to a dinner. You were

965
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:42,407
to be the main topic of conversation.

966
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:46,407
I know. I ran into Frank Peterson.

967
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:48,643
Can we talk man to man?

968
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:52,847
Man to man?
- Fine. I like that.

969
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:57,290
Hewlett Packard
wants to stay with Syntonex

970
01:17:57,680 --> 01:18:00,843
and with you at the wheel,
they'd be fools not to.

971
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:02,969
Syntonex is Laurel's baby.

972
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:09,161
If she wants a baby,
she should find a man and have one.

973
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:15,967
Are you alright?

974
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:20,046
I suddenly have a bad taste
in my mouth. Is this a Cuban?

975
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:22,841
No. Dominican.
- I don't smoke crap.

976
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:29,170
I'm so sorry. it won't happen again.
- Amazing that you'd offer it to me.

977
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:34,009
Frank has made a deal.
You get Laurel to cooperate,

978
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:39,440
they'll accept a plea bargain.
She'll get probation

979
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:42,923
and lose her license. And you,

980
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:46,051
old friend,
you'll be totally in the clear.

981
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:48,802
That's a hell of a deal.

982
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:53,091
She'll be well compensated
and we'll end up big winners.

983
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:54,322
Pull over.

984
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:58,764
If you don't like the deal,

985
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:04,849
just make the SEC problem go away,
and we'll forget it all. - Goodbye.

986
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:09,441
Syntonex needs you.
And you need us. Think about it.

987
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:11,569
Next time they'll be Cubans.

988
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:14,806
Damn.

989
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:17,963
Looked like Brando.

990
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:25,124
Alright Mr. Cutty,
what are you up to?

991
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:31,687
Follow him.

992
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:44,321
Pull over.

993
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:46,051
Hold it.

994
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:56,964
Park it, cabby. We'll hang out here.

995
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:08,570
Alright Cutty, you're going to die.

996
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:11,601
You're going to die.

997
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:18,804
That doesn't make sense.
- Laurel went in and never came out?

998
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:23,091
Cutty took Laurel's car to the Plaza
and went to her place

999
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:27,769
and never came out.
- After Laurel left this morning,

1000
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:32,324
I knocked, and nothing!
- She went in but he came out ...

1001
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:34,521
What?

1002
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:38,561
Nothing.

1003
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:40,281
Nothing.

1004
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:43,604
They knew they were being followed
and gave you the slip.

1005
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,161
You know what?

1006
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:48,370
I say live and let live.

1007
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:50,600
Merry Christmas.

1008
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:54,247
You too, you son of a bitch.

1009
01:20:55,840 --> 01:21:00,528
Even when I create the perfect man,
he stabs me in the back.

1010
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:04,641
Do you want to talk?
- No, I'm going to kill him.

1011
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:08,249
Good idea,
but there's one small problem.

1012
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:11,007
What? - How do you kill
someone who doesn't exist.

1013
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:15,724
I don't know. But if he's dead,
he can't go to the SEC. That's good.

1014
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:23,400
It's the nicest thing you've ever
given me. - I'm large like that.

1015
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:27,282
Wreckage of the craft was found
this morning off the Albanian coast.

1016
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:30,809
With no signs of life ...
- Oh my God.

1017
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:32,201
What?

1018
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:38,445
Mr. Cutty was on that ship.
- He was not. Stop it. - He was!

1019
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:41,801
Hello!

1020
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:44,770
He was on the ship.

1021
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:46,321
Of course.

1022
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:51,282
Sure, Cutty and Calamaris are best
friends. - And now he's dead.

1023
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:55,810
Oh my gosh!
Oh my gosh. it's perfect.

1024
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:59,682
Do you have a black dress?
- Yes. - Wear it, girl.

1025
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:01,650
I will.

1026
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:07,126
...the most generous man I ever knew.
- Excuse me, Miss Dugan.

1027
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:11,525
It's the worst thing that ever
happened to me. I'm crushed

1028
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:15,131
thinking that he's fish food now.

1029
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:19,366
And his body
will never be recovered ...

1030
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:32,203
They've rescued everyone on the yacht
and Mr. Cutty wasn't even on board.

1031
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:33,840
He's not dead?

1032
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:39,402
It's a miracle!

1033
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:45,326
You had the watch inscribed?
Dear Robert, keep searching.

1034
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:49,884
Who's J.? - One of those women
on his eternal search.

1035
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:55,085
Oh, got power.
- Mr. Cutty's missing a foot.

1036
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,685
He had two when I dressed him.
Forget it.

1037
01:22:59,080 --> 01:23:03,449
They'll think it came off
in the explosion. Really realistic.

1038
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:10,811
Speaking of which, shouldn't we
remove the hook from his head?

1039
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:13,084
Take it out!

1040
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,001
What?

1041
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:20,484
He moved.

1042
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:24,682
Are we doing the right thing?
- With the hook?

1043
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:29,529
No, getting rid of Mr. Cutty.
It seems sort of drastic.

1044
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:31,729
No more drastic than creating him.

1045
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:35,566
I found it.

1046
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:36,927
What?

1047
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:39,049
Just throw it in.

1048
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:44,966
Release the brake?

1049
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:47,205
Pull the brake.

1050
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:55,165
Goodbye, Mr. Cutty.

1051
01:23:57,720 --> 01:23:59,688
I'm going to miss him.

1052
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:10,566
It didn't blow up.

1053
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:18,610
What are we going to do?
- I don't know.

1054
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,480
Well, maybe we should leave it be.

1055
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:24,531
- How are we supposed to explain it?

1056
01:24:24,920 --> 01:24:27,890
We can't go down there.
It's just resting.

1057
01:24:28,280 --> 01:24:31,204
Explosions don't rest.
Either they explode or they don't.

1058
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:38,686
See?

1059
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:47,570
You alright?
- I'm great now.

1060
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:53,727
Good, we don't do this for a living.
- Yeah, ain't it though? Alright,

1061
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:59,251
let's get in the car and go home.
- We came in that car.

1062
01:25:04,160 --> 01:25:08,290
I thought you were so efficient.
Didn't you figure everything out?

1063
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:13,447
We blew up the damn car!
- You're telling me I have to walk?

1064
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:15,171
We just blew up the damn car!

1065
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,162
Listen, it's Christmas eve.

1066
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:34,804
The market is closing soon. There's
nothing I can do. You have to wait.

1067
01:25:56,560 --> 01:26:00,121
Laurel Ayres? - Yeah, who are you?
- Police. - Is something wrong?

1068
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:04,206
You could say that. You're under
arrest for murdering Robert Cutty.

1069
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:09,288
What do you mean?
Are you kidding?

1070
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:13,127
What are you doing? Watch my hair!
I just had it done!

1071
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:18,368
Let's settle this quickly.
I need to light a candle for my dad.

1072
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:22,845
That's nice. Starting with the truth
saves time. Do you mind?

1073
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:28,406
No, please. You'll laugh
when I tell you this story.

1074
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:30,404
You ready?
- Go.

1075
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:34,850
I couldn't have killed him, because
he doesn't exist. I made him up.

1076
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:39,086
If he doesn't exist,
then who's this at the Plaza?

1077
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:40,686
Oh, me.

1078
01:26:41,080 --> 01:26:44,482
Dressed up like Robert Cutty.
A great picture, huh?

1079
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:48,930
Help me out here.
First you pretend there was a Cutty.

1080
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:54,527
Then you pretend to be a Cutty.
And then you pretended to kill him?

1081
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:58,641
He took all the credit for everything.
I saved an entire company.

1082
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:04,490
And they gave him a box of cigars.
- You resented that. - Absolutely!

1083
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:07,724
You felt like you didn't exist.
- You know it!

1084
01:27:08,120 --> 01:27:12,523
If Cutty was alive, it wasn't going
to change. So you killed him. - Right!

1085
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:14,843
Blew him up in the car.

1086
01:27:15,240 --> 01:27:17,971
Dead as a doornail. Poof, he was gone.

1087
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:22,922
And how did you feel?
- Good. Like I knew that it would.

1088
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:25,322
Thank you. Yes!
- Ms. Ayres.

1089
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:31,007
Wait! I've seen Kojak.
I know what you just did.

1090
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:32,731
I didn't kill the guy.

1091
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:37,444
Just call my secretary, Sally Dugan.
She'll explain it all.

1092
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:39,046
She was my accomplice.

1093
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:43,411
Not my accomplice,
she's accomplished, I meant to say.

1094
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:45,723
She was my helper ...

1095
01:27:46,120 --> 01:27:49,442
She can tell you everything
you need to know.

1096
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:52,002
Sally Dugan? We'll do that.

1097
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:08,169
What happened?

1098
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:13,009
They arrested me in front of my family
at Christmas Eve dinner.

1099
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:17,361
They didn't believe you either.
- No, I'm an accomplice.

1100
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:22,123
I'm really sorry.
- It's not your fault.

1101
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:25,126
No, it's Cutty again.

1102
01:28:27,720 --> 01:28:29,370
You okay?

1103
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:34,768
Yeah. I have to go to the bathroom.
- Isn't there one here?

1104
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:39,643
Yeah, but did you see it?
- No. - I couldn't.

1105
01:28:40,040 --> 01:28:43,249
This could be a long wait.
- Oh my gosh.

1106
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:51,005
Frank, the tree is almost done.

1107
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:55,327
Just a second!
- I'm in the holiday spirits.

1108
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:59,370
A couple of more minutes.

1109
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:02,289
I've unwrapped your present.

1110
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:06,168
And I'm getting cold!

1111
01:29:09,160 --> 01:29:12,642
Keep your chestnuts roasting.

1112
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:17,963
Santa's making sure it's going to be
a very merry Christmas.

1113
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:23,531
And an amazing New Year.

1114
01:29:26,360 --> 01:29:27,691
Mr. Manchester ...

1115
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:33,923
Frank Peterson will answer everything.
- Alright. Here it is.

1116
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:37,881
Robert called me after the Plaza
incident to set up a new meeting.

1117
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:41,489
On his way, he was car-jacked.

1118
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:44,804
He was robbed.
Wallet, watch, jewelry, everything.

1119
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:52,043
I don't know about witnesses.
The carjacker obviously had enemies.

1120
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:56,809
How is he now?
- He was understandably shaken.

1121
01:29:57,200 --> 01:30:01,842
He had to leave New York, so he called
me and we left for Europe at once.

1122
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:04,846
...CNN, Robert Cutty is alive.

1123
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:07,841
He was the victim of a carjacking.

1124
01:30:11,120 --> 01:30:13,771
Call me.
- Okay I'll call you.

1125
01:30:15,960 --> 01:30:19,760
Your charges have been dropped, too.
- You finally believed us?

1126
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:23,130
The guy you said doesn't exist?

1127
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:26,604
Son of a bitch!
- We have a sworn affidavit

1128
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,401
from Frank Peterson, saying that Cutty

1129
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:32,201
is alive and on vacation in France.

1130
01:30:36,040 --> 01:30:39,840
I don't know.
I thought she'd be happier.

1131
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:48,165
Please Laurel. Don't do this to me.
3 days! This is not healthy.

1132
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:51,882
I'm going to have a heart attack.

1133
01:30:56,320 --> 01:30:58,721
Our top stories in business:

1134
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:02,966
The SEC has cleared
Robert Cutty on all charges.

1135
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:08,685
Walter Manchester announced the merger
of his and Cutty's companies.

1136
01:31:09,080 --> 01:31:11,162
As expected,
Frank Peterson was named president.

1137
01:31:11,560 --> 01:31:15,531
Laurel, it's Sally.
This is the 12th time I've called.

1138
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:18,842
Pick up the phone and talk to me.

1139
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:23,610
We're all worried sick
about you. Just stop this.

1140
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,446
Get up and pick up the phone!

1141
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:30,290
The SEC has suspended the license

1142
01:31:30,680 --> 01:31:33,365
of Laurel Ayres,
Cutty's former associate.

1143
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:46,930
We are talking to woman,
expecting but abandoned,

1144
01:31:47,320 --> 01:31:49,607
by wealthy, but elusive fathers.

1145
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:55,006
When's the baby due?
- Late July. - Does Mr. Cutty know?

1146
01:31:55,400 --> 01:31:57,243
He won't return my calls.

1147
01:31:58,040 --> 01:31:59,849
I love Robert Cutty.

1148
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:06,088
All I want is to meet him
to talk about our son's future.

1149
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:10,041
Talk about your immaculate conception.
- Excuse me.

1150
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:15,686
He doesn't return your calls?
So what if he's rich, sue his ass!

1151
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:18,082
Am I right?

1152
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:26,209
Answer the door. Alright, Laurel.
I'm sorry, but we're coming in.

1153
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:29,331
I hate to do this, but here it comes.

1154
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:36,646
Thank you so much. Thanks.
- Laurel?

1155
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:41,167
I'll take it from here. Thanks.
- Thanks, honey.

1156
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:43,608
Oh, what a mess.

1157
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,286
Are you crazy?

1158
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:47,570
Go away.

1159
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:49,971
My gosh!

1160
01:32:50,360 --> 01:32:53,330
Look at this.
Your door is broken.

1161
01:32:53,720 --> 01:32:56,485
My, haven't you been busy.

1162
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:58,484
For goodness sake.

1163
01:32:59,880 --> 01:33:03,248
You're driving us all crazy.
People are worried sick about you.

1164
01:33:03,640 --> 01:33:08,089
Now you can go and tell them
I'm fine. I'm stuck in my own world.

1165
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:11,927
My couch, my TV,
and lots of delivery people. Go away.

1166
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:18,487
A shame to let them take away
the house your dad worked so hard for.

1167
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:23,363
Leave him out of this.
- You didn't bother to light a candle.

1168
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:27,083
Where were we this year?
In jail, were we not?

1169
01:33:27,480 --> 01:33:31,201
Now you're not. Get up
and go do it now! - No!

1170
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:33,011
Get dressed and go!

1171
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:37,970
Don't fight.

1172
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:42,684
We're going to light a candle ...
- Go home!

1173
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:47,688
Oh my gosh.
First thing, brush your teeth!

1174
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:13,922
Thank you, Sally.

1175
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:20,291
What are we going to do?
- Go home and go to bed.

1176
01:34:20,680 --> 01:34:23,411
I mean about the future. Yours, mine.

1177
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:27,566
Don't tie yours up with mine.
I'm done. Frank's got Cutty.

1178
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:32,124
Snap out of it. Frank's got Cutty.
So what? Good riddance.

1179
01:34:32,520 --> 01:34:35,649
He's a bunch of trouble.
- You're right. - Right.

1180
01:34:36,040 --> 01:34:38,930
By the way, you'll love this.

1181
01:34:39,320 --> 01:34:43,962
The Peabody Club is making Cutty
a member. - Really?

1182
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:49,161
They're voting him Business Man
of the Year. - As they should!

1183
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:51,722
Nobody had a year like Cutty.

1184
01:34:52,120 --> 01:34:55,044
It was my year. Nobody had a year
like me. - I know.

1185
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:58,922
Your name should be on that plaque.
- Yeah, it should.

1186
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:06,281
There's going to be a big dinner
with chicken and fruit cocktail.

1187
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:08,361
And Frank.

1188
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:11,047
He's accepting the award for Cutty.

1189
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:14,125
How is it possible? I mean

1190
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:18,081
he got my promotion.
He gets Cutty, he ... - You know

1191
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:21,643
as long as
Frank's got Cutty, he's got you, too.

1192
01:35:28,920 --> 01:35:32,720
Yeah, because I'm Cutty.

1193
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:40,370
You know what?

1194
01:35:41,640 --> 01:35:42,641
Yeah?

1195
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:48,811
Call me!
- I'm going to.

1196
01:35:56,920 --> 01:35:58,729
Thank you very much.

1197
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:03,970
Gentlemen, good evening.
Tonight we welcome our newest member

1198
01:36:04,360 --> 01:36:09,048
and winner of the Peabody
Business Man of the Year award.

1199
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,923
Pardon me, ladies.

1200
01:36:15,320 --> 01:36:19,803
Pardon me, ladies.
Up the stairs, gentlemen.

1201
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,287
I have some very bad news.

1202
01:36:25,680 --> 01:36:30,527
I've just heard that Robert Cutty
will not be here this evening.

1203
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:36,086
There's a typhoon in Hong Kong,
so his plane is grounded.

1204
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:39,689
I spoke with Bob,
and he was very disappointed.

1205
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:43,004
He asked me
to convey his deepest regret

1206
01:36:43,400 --> 01:36:47,086
and sincere gratitude for being
welcomed into this illustrious club.

1207
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:51,128
And for this prestigious award.

1208
01:36:52,200 --> 01:36:53,565
On behalf of

1209
01:36:53,960 --> 01:36:58,841
my close friend and colleague,
Robert Cutty, I'd like to ...

1210
01:37:00,360 --> 01:37:02,681
Mr. Cutty is here.
- No, he's not.

1211
01:37:04,120 --> 01:37:07,806
He's here.
- I'd like to ...

1212
01:37:20,680 --> 01:37:22,569
Cutty made it. He's here.

1213
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:24,486
I don't believe it.

1214
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:40,724
You won't get away with it.
- Watch me.

1215
01:37:41,640 --> 01:37:45,406
Donald, still smoking
those cheap cigars?

1216
01:37:47,120 --> 01:37:48,610
Nice to see you, Robert.

1217
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:53,642
Walter, my new partner. Frank, no!
I like it when you're close.

1218
01:37:54,040 --> 01:37:55,769
Without you, I wouldn't be here.

1219
01:37:56,160 --> 01:38:01,200
Gentlemen, I took the Concorde
and beat out that damned typhoon.

1220
01:38:01,720 --> 01:38:06,647
It's wonderful to be accepted
into an exclusive club.

1221
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:10,203
It makes a man feel,
well, damned good.

1222
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:17,008
You knew nothing about me,

1223
01:38:17,400 --> 01:38:21,371
yet you accepted me
as one of your own. I find it amazing.

1224
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:25,560
My work spoke for itself and now
I'm Business Man of the Year.

1225
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:31,520
But in the words of Groucho Marx,

1226
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:35,367
I don't want to be part of a club
that would have me as a member.

1227
01:38:39,640 --> 01:38:43,247
We need to encourage our young people.
I mean to share this award

1228
01:38:43,640 --> 01:38:46,371
with the young person at my left.

1229
01:38:46,760 --> 01:38:50,560
For his hard work.
He's been my inspiration.

1230
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:54,004
I really owe it all to him.

1231
01:38:54,640 --> 01:38:56,210
Take a bow.

1232
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:18,282
Holy shit!
- Figures.

1233
01:39:19,120 --> 01:39:20,531
You know, gentlemen,

1234
01:39:21,720 --> 01:39:25,884
there's something about exclusivity.

1235
01:39:26,280 --> 01:39:29,523
The word means to exclude.

1236
01:39:30,280 --> 01:39:32,328
As I thought it would in my case.

1237
01:39:35,680 --> 01:39:40,720
I played by the rules,
I worked really hard,

1238
01:39:41,120 --> 01:39:42,690
and was very honest.

1239
01:39:43,800 --> 01:39:44,767
I know

1240
01:39:45,160 --> 01:39:50,291
that I didn't have
the right image for this club

1241
01:39:51,120 --> 01:39:55,250
and would never have it.
Image is a funny thing.

1242
01:39:57,280 --> 01:40:02,684
Under the right image might be
the wrong one. Under the wrong one

1243
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,731
might be the real Robert Cutty.

1244
01:40:14,120 --> 01:40:15,451
Far out.

1245
01:40:21,080 --> 01:40:25,369
Possibly the man serving you
coffee or offering you a cigar.

1246
01:40:25,880 --> 01:40:30,204
It could be your busboy
or your waiter. You never know.

1247
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:35,401
I want to congratulate you
for inducting into the Peabody Club

1248
01:40:35,800 --> 01:40:37,882
your first woman member.

1249
01:40:46,280 --> 01:40:47,964
Thank you.

1250
01:41:22,760 --> 01:41:24,762
Alright, Laurel!

1251
01:41:29,960 --> 01:41:31,689
Next week we'll do lunch, okay?

1252
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:41,204
It's about time!

1253
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:57,845
You were fabulous.
- We did it.

1254
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:26,523
I used to think
that doing business meant

1255
01:42:26,920 --> 01:42:29,844
being insensitive and cruel.

1256
01:42:31,480 --> 01:42:34,962
Why is it that men
always hurt the ones they love most?

1257
01:42:36,040 --> 01:42:42,127
I've done a lot of soul-searching
and I feel reborn, liberated.

1258
01:42:42,520 --> 01:42:47,208
I've really gotten in touch
with my feminine side.

1259
01:42:48,080 --> 01:42:53,883
I feel ready to change
into the kind of caring,

1260
01:42:54,280 --> 01:42:58,330
feeling executive
you want for this company.

1261
01:42:58,720 --> 01:43:01,883
I only ask for the chance
to prove that to you.

1262
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:07,568
It's really wonderful.

1263
01:43:07,960 --> 01:43:12,761
It's remarkable
how people can change.

1264
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:15,161
However,

1265
01:43:15,560 --> 01:43:19,167
knowing my associate as I do,

1266
01:43:19,560 --> 01:43:22,404
I'm afraid
it would really piss her off.

1267
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:27,321
I'm going to perpetrate a whammy!
