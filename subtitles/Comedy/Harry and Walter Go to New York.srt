1
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,436
- Hey!
- Gimme a bag!

2
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:47,980
What's the matter?

3
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:51,100
There was a chicken
in my bag.

4
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:53,652
There was a chicken
in my bag.

5
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:12,709
I think we got the goose.

6
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,328
Hands.

7
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,661
Mm-hmm.
Very nice.

8
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,492
That's better.
Good.

9
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:15,124
Mm-hmm. Yes.

10
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:22,051
Perkins. Mm-hmm.
Mmm.

11
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:35,182
Marie, now what have I told you
about reading that rubbish?

12
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:38,939
I wasn't reading it, Mr. Worth.
I was just looking at your picture.

13
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:41,487
- It's nice, isn't it?
- Yes, isn't it?

14
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:42,563
Mr. Worth.

15
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,614
Ah, good morning, George.
Has my guest arrived?

16
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,444
He's at your table,
Mr. Worth.

17
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,708
You're looking a little peaked
this morning, George.

18
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:02,634
- Feeling all right?
- Champion, Mr. Worth. Just champion.

19
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,551
Ah, Mr. Crisp.

20
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,254
How nice to see you.

21
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:10,888
George, do you think you might bring us
some of Henri's blueberry muffins?

22
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,060
I didn't come here
to dine.

23
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:21,064
Is it the door?
It 'tis, isn't it?

24
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:24,192
It's the damage we did
to the door of your bank.

25
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:26,114
I take full responsibility.

26
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:29,444
I insist that you send the bill
for repair to my attorney.

27
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:32,784
I'm touched
by your generosity, Mr. Worth.

28
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,160
Deeply touched.

29
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:37,995
But Mr. Mosler of the Mosler
Safe Company has seen to it...

30
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:40,421
that our bank
is now invulnerable.

31
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,999
- Oh?
- Let's get on with it.

32
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:45,460
- As you wish.
- You have my securities?

33
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:48,429
I propose the standard
arrangement that we enjoy...

34
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:55,561
That we enjoy with every
bank president here in New York.

35
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:58,014
Naturally, we keep the cash.

36
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:01,192
We return the securities to you
for 15 cents on the dollar.

37
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:06,482
The one question that remains is
how much of a fee you yourself require.

38
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:09,443
Are you suggesting I bamboozle
my own board of directors?

39
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:12,700
Bamboozle?
What a quaint phrase.

40
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,281
I realize, of course,
that you've incurred certain expenses,

41
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,992
traveling here to retrieve
your securities,

42
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:22,330
but then I had to go all the way
to Massachusetts to rob your bank.

43
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:26,418
And you're going back.
But this time you're going to jail.

44
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:27,627
I beg your pardon?

45
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:31,756
Arrest him!
He's got the securities!

46
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,718
Adam Worth,
you're under arrest for the robbery

47
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:38,304
of the Commercial Bank and
Trust Company in Lowell, Massachusetts.

48
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,312
Sergeant O'Reilly.

49
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,769
- Is that revolver loaded?
- Oh, it 'tis, sir.

50
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:46,820
Well, put it away
before you hurt yourself.

51
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:49,820
But I can't.

52
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:53,153
He can't, Adam,
because I'm here.

53
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,954
Billy Gallagher,
detective extraordinary.

54
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,577
In the flesh.

55
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:01,832
But Billy,
this is New York.

56
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:05,040
And this is a Boston
bench warrant for your arrest.

57
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,709
I'm afraid you underestimated
Mr. Crisp, Adam.

58
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,716
He called me and me company
because he knows

59
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:14,139
that you own every cop
in New York.

60
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,467
All right, officer.

61
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:24,192
- I can't tell you how sorry I am.
- Don't feel badly, O'Reilly.

62
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:27,611
Contact my attorney and have him
cancel my steamer ticket.

63
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,984
Please don't cry, Marie.

64
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:35,487
I'm sorry, Mr. Worth.
There was nothing I could do.

65
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,663
Here, George.
Cheer up.

66
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:40,457
And for the love of God,
get yourself a new orchestra.

67
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:47,378
Mr. Crisp, whatever has
become of gentlemanly manners?

68
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,834
Gentlemanly manners!

69
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:52,841
You are a thief,
Mr. Worth.

70
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:56,550
Perhaps this will teach you not
to fool with Rufus T. Crisp!

71
00:07:56,643 --> 00:08:00,262
It will teach me to be a little
less lenient with you next time, sir.

72
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:03,268
There won't be a next time
for you, Mr. Worth.

73
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:07,068
You'll be behind bars.

74
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:10,988
We shall meet again, Mr. Crisp.
You can bank on it.

75
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:24,956
What now, oh,
fantastic woman of the east?

76
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,584
What is it that I hold
in my hand?

77
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:33,252
I see...

78
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:38,553
I see a small, round object.

79
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:39,633
A locket.

80
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:42,345
A beautiful locket.

81
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:44,351
A locket.
Ladies and gentlemen, a locket.

82
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:46,103
And a beautiful one!

83
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,685
Here you are, my sweet.
How old are you?

84
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:52,362
- Twenty-one.
- I'll meet you in a half hour.

85
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,862
Lovely child.
Bless you.

86
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:58,991
Now, who else? Who else would
care to challenge the mystical gifts...

87
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,743
- of the great Madame Rabina?
- Right here!

88
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,790
I don't care,
it matters not to the madame.

89
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,961
Anyone at all?
Oh, very well.

90
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,663
She ain't gonna guess that.

91
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:10,623
Oh, great woman of the east.

92
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:16,258
What is it now
that I hold in my hand?

93
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:20,466
- Oy-y-y-y! Spirits. Come down.
- Arrest them, officers!

94
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,224
Please, please, please,
the madame needs complete silence.

95
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:26,601
- Sha! Sha!
- Hold on a minute.

96
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:29,149
I walked in here with $30,
and I walked out with 20.

97
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,727
These chiselers stole
ten dollars out of my wallet!

98
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,939
Officers, if you don't mind. Would you
please, please keep this man quiet?

99
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:37,821
- He's disturbing the spirits.
- Hey, wait a minute!

100
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,197
Some of my money's missing!

101
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:42,121
Excuse me! I can clear this
confusion immediately.

102
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:44,290
- Where were you sitting, sir?
- Right here.

103
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,662
Right here. I'm sure that if you look
under your seat

104
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:48,995
you will find exactly what it is
that you are missing.

105
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:52,127
Please, if everyone would look
directly under their seats,

106
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:54,174
I'm sure we can clear up
this confusion.

107
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,843
Way under.
And run, Walter!

108
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,593
- Hey! Hey!
- And help me find the missing money.

109
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,298
Harry, you promised.
You promised!

110
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:05,011
My father, the sheikh,
will have you trampled by camels!

111
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:08,849
I never saw that man before in my life.
He's not a prince.

112
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,559
- You're stepping on my dress.
- We're gonna get through early tonight.

113
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,340
All right,
let's move it!

114
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,262
Let's move up these steps here.
Come on. Come on!

115
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:51,599
Keep it going.
Let's go.

116
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:55,403
Come on. Get off of there.
Let's go.

117
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:05,701
Harry, I just want you to know how much I
appreciate everything you've done for me.

118
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,622
- That's all right.
- It's not all right, Harry!

119
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:09,951
Shut up, both of ya.
Come on, that means move!

120
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:14,626
Here he comes!

121
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:38,355
Good morning, everybody!
Good morning, good morning.

122
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,110
Good morning.

123
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:45,073
Thank you all so much for coming out
to see me. I do appreciate this.

124
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:46,825
Hey, Adam! How many safes
have you blown?

125
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:49,202
Obviously one too many,
or I wouldn't be here, would I?

126
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:52,201
- That's Adam Worth!
- Who?

127
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:54,958
- Adam Worth.
- Thank you for coming along to see me.

128
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,665
Hello, little lady. Let me give you
an autograph here. There we are.

129
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,046
What a pretty hat you have there.
Hello, sunshine.

130
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,924
Good morning, darling.
I'm overwhelmed by the reception.

131
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:04,630
- Would you like a picture, sir?
- Yes, sir.

132
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,090
Stand back. Put the flag down.

133
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:08,597
Here we are.

134
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,439
Mr. Worth, I'm Warden Durgom.

135
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:17,438
Quiet, please. Quiet.

136
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:20,566
- Who are you?
- Warden Durgom, sir.

137
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:23,445
How courteous of you
to welcome me personally.

138
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,776
As soon as I'm settled in,
we'll have a chat.

139
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,032
If you'll excuse me
for a moment.

140
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,415
Good-bye, ladies.

141
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,418
I'll see you all again...

142
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,596
The moment that visiting
privileges...

143
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,101
Move back.
Give her some air.

144
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,678
...can be arranged.

145
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:56,516
The trouble with you and me, Walter,
is that we're thinking too small.

146
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,693
The only trouble with you and me, Harry,
happens to be you.

147
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,691
- Good-bye, Leary.
- Me? Oh.

148
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,489
All right, you two loudmouths.
Out of line.

149
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,908
- Oh, we weren't saying—
- Move it! Out of line!

150
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:14,242
My advice is just not to mix
with the general population.

151
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,247
- Come right this way, please.
- Warden.

152
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,703
Get back! Hey!

153
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:23,251
Trouble. He almost got us that time.
We gotta be very careful on this ward.

154
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:27,088
No kindness can you extend at all.
Give 'em an inch, and they take a foot.

155
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,047
Nickel-and-dimers,
like I told you before.

156
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,350
Just step this way,
and everything'll be okay.

157
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:35,353
Good morning.

158
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,518
Walter, today could be
the luckiest day in our lives. Believe me.

159
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,901
How do you do it, Adam?

160
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:48,826
It must be extremely difficult
for you here.

161
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,779
Difficult?

162
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:57,831
It's an absolute nightmare.
My silver lobster forks have gone.

163
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,958
The mildew on the walls
is destroying my draperies.

164
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:05,339
And I haven't once bathed in
truly hot water since I arrived here.

165
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:07,340
- Would you like a cigar, sir?
- Oh, thank you.

166
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,592
Try the, uh, quail eggs,
Jack.

167
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:19,974
And something has got to be done about
the noise from that damned nitro detail...

168
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:21,980
in the rock quarry!

169
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:26,697
- More brandy, Warden?
- Thank you, no, sir.

170
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:29,696
I have pressing duties
at the gate.

171
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:32,119
The eats
was magnificent.

172
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:36,245
I particularly was taken
with those... little chickens.

173
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:41,545
Mr. Chatsworth,
it was nice to meet you, sir.

174
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:43,588
It was likewise.

175
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,216
Excuse me, sir.

176
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,597
Would you care for us
to clear the dishes now?

177
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:57,928
Later, Harold.

178
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:02,266
Right now, Mr. Chatsworth and I
would appreciate a bit of privacy.

179
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,524
Come back in an hour.

180
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,650
Did you try the quail eggs,
Jack?

181
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,106
Uh, excuse me, sir.

182
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:13,365
Would that be in the icehouse
with the wine, sir?

183
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:15,741
Would what be in the icehouse
with the wine?

184
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:16,993
Privacy, sir.

185
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,374
Good-bye, Harold.

186
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,332
Right.
Walter.

187
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,880
I thought they'd make a nice
change from the gulls' eggs.

188
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:26,878
They're so large.
Just— Just try one.

189
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,754
This is for later,
Mr. Worth.

190
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,344
Good-bye, Walter.

191
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:44,733
Adam,
where'd you find those two oafs?

192
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:46,731
Oh, they're not oafs, Jack.

193
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:48,858
They would require practice
to become oafs.

194
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,159
- Did you bring the plans?
- Right here.

195
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,915
You know, I stood right there with
Spangler while he drew them from memory,

196
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:01,867
12 hours after he'd burned
the original.

197
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:07,665
Imagine, Mosler's own designer
selling us the blueprints

198
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:09,715
of the Crisp
invulnerable bank.

199
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,797
Marvelous. Exquisite.

200
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:16,757
Come over here, Jack.

201
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,139
- And all from memory?
- Mm-hmm.

202
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:23,393
Brilliant. Take the other side
of the picture, Jack.

203
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:29,395
You did give him
the $20,000, didn't you?

204
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,025
With my own hands.

205
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,657
And now he's probably
halfway to Tahiti.

206
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:39,534
The man's an artist.
A true artist.

207
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:48,126
They are beautiful.
There's no denying.

208
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:52,085
But you know, Adam,
$20,000 is a lot of money...

209
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:54,340
to be investing
in revenge.

210
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,305
Revenge, Jack?

211
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:03,847
You don't really think that I would stoop
to anything as petty as revenge, do you?

212
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,624
That guy just stole
my hair.

213
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,732
Back.

214
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:57,487
I keep the wrong door.
It's a joke, Jack. See ya.

215
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,587
I wish you'd be a little more
careful with the hair, Harry.

216
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:12,756
I found a lock of it
in my soup last night.

217
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:14,799
Keep your soup
away from my hair.

218
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:23,342
Hey.

219
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,553
What do you think
of our new ad?

220
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:30,683
"Special. A lock of hair from the head
of Adam Worth, the emperor of thieves.

221
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,234
Souvenir buttons
from his shirts—" da, da, da.

222
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:36,155
"All for 25 cents. Hurry, hurry, hurry."

223
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,823
You oughta be ashamed, Harry.
Ashamed.

224
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:41,652
Never mind.
We got a business to run.

225
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:47,165
Um, Walter, my, uh—
my eyes are very tired.

226
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:50,164
Could, uh— could you
read this for me, please?

227
00:18:56,552 --> 00:19:00,296
"Dear Mr. Worth. I want to be
just like you when I grow up,

228
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:04,133
so I broke into my big brother's
piggy bank and stole 25 cents

229
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,218
to send to you
for your picture.

230
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:10,522
Sincerely, Fred Dooley.
Age 12, writ by hand."

231
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:13,442
- Ah, that's beautiful.
- It's criminal, Harry.

232
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:16,235
One genuine autographed picture
coming up for little Fred Dooley.

233
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,406
Give him a good button,
Harry.

234
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,447
Is that nice?

235
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:33,208
Difficult?
Maybe impossible.

236
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:40,051
But the challenge,
Mr. Crisp, is irresistible.

237
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:49,436
Hey, Walter.
What do you think, huh?

238
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,730
Will you take that off?
He's gonna kill us, Harry!

239
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:55,105
Stop it! He's studying
them diagrams. Stop it.

240
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,686
Harold, Walter,
come in here!

241
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:02,153
- Mr. Worth?
- At your service, sir.

242
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:07,537
Would you call
this glass clean?

243
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:08,739
No.

244
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,041
I'm sorry, sir.

245
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:13,289
- Uh, we'll have it shined right up.
- Yes, sir.

246
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:14,995
Why don't you shine it
on your jacket?

247
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:17,752
Oh! Oh, he was just
trying this on for size, sir.

248
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:19,174
- It's a beautiful garment.
- Yes, sir.

249
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,549
I noticed that last week— last week
when you had it on, sir, uh,

250
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:25,597
it was a little snug, and I thought
if I just moved the buttons just...

251
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:27,015
Speaking of buttons.

252
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:29,639
What's happened to all
the buttons on my shirts?

253
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:31,890
Buttons? Uh, sir...

254
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:33,688
Oh, it must be
the laundry, sir.

255
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,015
They've been—
They're very...

256
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:36,270
The laundry.

257
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,899
Lord knows, I spoke to them, sir.
I'm sure that they're not hand...

258
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:42,652
Used to handling
fancy shirts like that, sir.

259
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,699
I'll speak to them.
I'll speak to them right away.

260
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:47,243
And you, uh, take care of that.
I'm sorry for him, sir.

261
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:50,072
Polish this right up, sir.

262
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,032
You're a bit of a Jack of all trades,
aren't you, Harold?

263
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:54,459
Butler, waiter, tailor.

264
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:56,912
Uh... singer.

265
00:20:57,006 --> 00:20:59,419
Dancer, comedian.

266
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:02,171
You're not going to start all that
singing and dancing again, are you?

267
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,298
Sir, if you'd just
give us one chance.

268
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,004
I'm gonna get this silverware...

269
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,090
- And really polish it up.
- Just one chance. No!

270
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,848
This— This man
is so good.

271
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,771
He, uh—
He can do anything that, um,

272
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:17,395
Eddie Foy or Tony Pastor
can do, and better, sir.

273
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:19,101
If you'd give us that one chance.

274
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:20,982
I'm gonna dust
in the bedroom, sir.

275
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:23,814
H-He's shy. Very shy.

276
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:26,491
And all great artists
are very, very shy, sir.

277
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:27,909
Not all, Harold.

278
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:36,118
- Whoa.
- Thank you very much.

279
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:38,541
God, can that man
pick 'em.

280
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:41,835
Miss Chestnut, I presume?

281
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:43,542
You presume correctly.
And you?

282
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:46,424
My name is Durgom.
I'm the warden. Captain O'Meara.

283
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:47,971
Hello, Captain O'Meara.
How are you?

284
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:49,298
You're here to see Adam Worth.

285
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:50,848
Yes, yes.
I have an appointment.

286
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:55,141
- Who's he?
- Oh, he takes pictures.

287
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,097
Jesus.

288
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,567
You're planning to spend
the evening?

289
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:04,488
Oh. Um...

290
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:07,858
Mr. Durgom,
I am a newspaper woman.

291
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:11,320
I came here to interview
Adam Worth, not to entertain him.

292
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,295
Big ending now.
Then I'm going to sax.

293
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:47,944
That's enough, boys.
The audition is over.

294
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,776
- Sir, there's just a little bit more.
- No there isn't, Harold.

295
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:54,371
- Right.
- Please come in.

296
00:22:56,792 --> 00:23:00,206
Mr. Worth, may I present
Miss Chestnut from...

297
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:02,083
The <i>Advocate.</i>

298
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:04,755
Miss Chestnut. Thank you
for your charming letter.

299
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:07,380
I have been looking forward
to your visit.

300
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:11,053
Oh, well, thank you,
Mr. Worth. My!

301
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,722
My, my, my, my, my.

302
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:16,051
I see that, uh, you have
your own private cell.

303
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:19,855
Um, your own
personal belongings.

304
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:23,524
And, uh, even
your own entertainment.

305
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,983
A meager effort to rehabilitate
these poor young men, I'm afraid.

306
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,939
But thank you for noticing.

307
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:35,783
Uh, yes, this is my assistant,
Mr. Lewis Hopkins.

308
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:41,034
I was, uh— I was just
wondering if he might take, um...

309
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:44,371
A few photographs
while we talk.

310
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:46,714
Of course.

311
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,666
You may leave now,
Mr. Durgom.

312
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:51,299
Yes, sir. If there's anything else
you need, let me know.

313
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:52,595
Certainly.

314
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:58,014
My goodness, Mr. Worth.
Even your own warden.

315
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:01,312
A lonely man in an underpaid job,
Miss Chestnut.

316
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:03,685
Let us not judge him too harshly.

317
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:05,358
Hold it.

318
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:09,734
My next question is, why should—
if you don't mind my saying...

319
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:13,692
A handsome, cultivated
millionaire...

320
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:17,496
continue to steal
for no apparent purpose?

321
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:18,992
No purpose?

322
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:24,749
Do you know what it's like to break
into a bank at 2:00 in the morning?

323
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:25,919
No.

324
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:31,339
Every pore in your body

325
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:33,966
tingles with the possibility
of failure...

326
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:37,390
The danger of being caught.

327
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:40,640
- Less danger. Right.
- Hold it!

328
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:54,279
They're coming, Harry!
Harry, they're coming.

329
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,248
Ah, refreshments.

330
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:06,419
Yes, uh, Walter, would you
kindly open the champagne, please?

331
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:09,998
And, uh, two very nice
clean glasses, sir.

332
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:11,378
Excellent.

333
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:13,710
Carve the lemon
and the onion, Harold.

334
00:25:13,804 --> 00:25:14,760
Right.

335
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:16,258
My readers will be pleased to know

336
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:19,682
that you are still in possession
of so much of your hair.

337
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,350
Oh?
Do they think I've lost it?

338
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:24,430
Surely they are concerned, considering
the recent sale of so many of your

339
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:27,311
locks of hair as the result
of the advertisement.

340
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:28,437
Oh! Oh!

341
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:30,063
- Oh, sir!
- You stupid oaf!

342
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:32,612
I ought to have you flogged!

343
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:35,694
I'll get a towel, sir.

344
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:38,117
You'll take your shirt off
and take it off right now!

345
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:42,243
No, he will do
no such thing!

346
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:45,325
How dare you talk to that man
as if he were your slave!

347
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:46,409
Miss Chestnut,

348
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:49,462
I'd appreciate it if you'd allow me
to control my servants as I see fit!

349
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:50,538
No!

350
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,965
Young man, young man,
what is your name?

351
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,544
- What is your name, young man?
- Walter!

352
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,004
- Walter.
- Walter Hill.

353
00:25:58,098 --> 00:25:59,088
Walter Hill.

354
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:00,970
Yes, and I'm Harry.
I'm Harry Dighby.

355
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,052
Harry Dighby. Hill and Dighby.

356
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:04,977
Well, Dighby and Hill.
The billing doesn't matter.

357
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:08,307
- Mr. Hill. Walter.
- Walter.

358
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,857
When you— Wait.

359
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:13,228
Here is a copy
of our newspaper.

360
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:16,531
Now, when you and your friend
are released from this penitentiary,

361
00:26:16,617 --> 00:26:19,781
I want you to come to New York City,
because we at the <i>Advocate</i>

362
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:22,829
will help you to find
a new direction to your lives!

363
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:25,282
Now, Mr. Worth,

364
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:29,244
if you would care to show me
the remainder of your highly erot...

365
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:34,591
your highly exotic lodgings,
I would be deeply appreciative,

366
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,713
as I have a train to catch.

367
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:38,796
Well? Well?

368
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:40,881
Calmly, calmly,
Miss Chestnut.

369
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:42,181
Yes.

370
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,850
Calmly, calmly.
This way, please.

371
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,974
- This way.
- Clean it up.

372
00:26:52,236 --> 00:26:54,319
You stupid.
You're stupid!

373
00:26:56,824 --> 00:26:59,487
This, as you can see,
is the bathroom.

374
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:01,697
What?

375
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:04,621
Get the camera.
Get the camera.

376
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,242
Get the camera.

377
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,995
- Harry, what—
- Bring it over here.

378
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:09,246
Why?

379
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:10,827
Hurry. Set it up, set it up.

380
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:12,708
Oh, silver!

381
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,123
What, you want to take a picture?

382
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:17,254
What are you gonna take
a picture of, Harry?

383
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,463
Of that.

384
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:23,389
Are you crazy?

385
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,137
- He'll kill us!
- He will if we don't hurry!

386
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:27,469
Load this flash thing.
Put a lot of that stuff in there.

387
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:29,350
- I want a clear picture.
- You're gonna get us...

388
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:31,681
Why do you always argue
with me when I try to be smart?

389
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:34,643
- He's gonna flog me.
- Put a lot of it in there!

390
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:35,897
Hey, what is this thing?

391
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:37,650
That's to measure with.
Come on, Harry.

392
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:41,107
Wait! Okay, perfect.
Give me this.

393
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,863
It's so lovely.

394
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:46,989
On the count of three,
shoot this picture. Ready?

395
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:49,574
- Harry, let's not!
- It's the chance of a lifetime.

396
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,375
Shoot when I tell a you.

397
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:53,953
One, two, three, shoot.

398
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:55,003
Oh!

399
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,456
It's on fire!

400
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:59,463
Get the champagne bottle!
Open it up and aim! Hurry up.

401
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:01,840
- Harry.
- Get the champagne.

402
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:05,223
Now what are they up to?

403
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:07,722
- Spray the champagne!
- I can't get it open, Harry.

404
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:10,645
Oh, you're so slow!
God, are we in trouble!

405
00:28:10,731 --> 00:28:12,723
Put it out!

406
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:16,025
- That's it. More champagne!
- Are we in trouble?

407
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:18,736
Oh, my God.

408
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:24,075
He took a picture!
He don't know how to take a picture!

409
00:28:24,161 --> 00:28:27,245
You see, sir, he was taking
a picture of me and he came too close.

410
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:28,947
He can take
a very good picture, sir.

411
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:30,623
Get away from there!

412
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:32,996
Look!

413
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,498
Get outta here!

414
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:37,330
- We'd better go.
- Get outta here, you!

415
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:38,835
Not you two!

416
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:40,007
You two, get out!

417
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:42,380
- It was an accident!
- Quiet!

418
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:46,841
I will not be responsible for my actions
if you don't get outta here!

419
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:48,266
Warden!

420
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:50,639
Mr. Durgom, get in here!

421
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,186
Is something wrong,
Mr. Worth?

422
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:54,389
I need a favor, Mr. Durgom.

423
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:59,603
I want these two clods assigned
to the nitro detail as soon as possible.

424
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:00,857
You mean permanently, sir?

425
00:29:00,948 --> 00:29:03,861
No, Mr. Durgom.
Not permanently!

426
00:29:03,951 --> 00:29:06,443
Just until they die!
Go!

427
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:09,028
Come on, Harry.
Come on!

428
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:12,206
Come on!
Come on, Harry.

429
00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:18,292
Take cover!
Take cover!

430
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:22,717
Hey! hey, uh, excuse me?
Excuse me!

431
00:29:22,803 --> 00:29:26,342
Over there. Hey!
Will you hold the fire, please?

432
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:30,391
There's a man hanging in the air here.
Take it up.

433
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:33,436
Get it—
That's good.

434
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:37,603
Stop this!

435
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:42,691
Come on, Harry!

436
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:50,240
Harry. Harry. We got more.
Let me show ya!

437
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,743
- Come on!
- Back to work. Back to work.

438
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:58,370
Dangerous work, huh?

439
00:29:58,463 --> 00:29:59,920
Follow me!

440
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:03,708
Go ahead, Harry.

441
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,714
Take a look.
Take a look.

442
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:12,599
Frozen nitro.

443
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:14,552
All right, Harry.
Here's what you do, see.

444
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:17,263
You take this
and grab that frozen lump.

445
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:19,940
You put it right down there, and you
cut a great big chunk off, like that.

446
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:22,940
Then you take the chunk, see,
and you put it in this.

447
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,238
And then you put that
on the stove so it melts.

448
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:27,691
Then you grab this.
I'll show ya. Watch.

449
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:30,242
Watch this. You got it in there,
and then you go...

450
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:34,952
And you pour that
right in there, real easy.

451
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:37,534
It's easy.
Then you just take that...

452
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,207
and there it is.

453
00:30:41,298 --> 00:30:42,334
Okay?

454
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,713
Good luck, Harry.
You're gonna need it!

455
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:15,370
Cut off a chunk.

456
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:25,960
Pick it up.

457
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:22,407
It's gonna blow!
Oh, it's gonna blow!

458
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:33,835
You've got good reflexes, Harry.
Let's see how good you do tomorrow.

459
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:39,511
Harry, what happened?
I heard the explosion.

460
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:40,512
Watch it!

461
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:42,559
- They hurt you, Harry?
- No. We're gettin' out of here.

462
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:43,853
I got nitro.

463
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:47,019
- Harry, you're insane.
- Yeah.

464
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:49,691
I wasn't sure before,
but now I'm positive. Help!

465
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:51,895
Shh! Ow!
You bit me!

466
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:54,526
Yeah. That's not all I'm gonna do, Harry!
Just leave me alone!

467
00:33:56,952 --> 00:33:59,239
Don't you realize that if they
kill me in that nitro shack,

468
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:00,410
tomorrow it's your turn?

469
00:34:00,497 --> 00:34:03,581
Maybe not. I wrote a letter
of apology to Adam Worth.

470
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:05,078
You think that's gonna
change his mind?

471
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:06,329
Well, it's worth trying,
isn't it?

472
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:07,455
No.

473
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:15,089
Look. Did we, or did we not
get a picture of those plans?

474
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:17,044
Yes, we did.
Burnt to a crisp.

475
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:19,130
Well, maybe not.
I've been thinking about that.

476
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:20,556
Uh-oh.

477
00:34:21,351 --> 00:34:25,015
Look. You work in that
photography shop.

478
00:34:25,105 --> 00:34:28,473
Now, that, uh...
that thingamajig on the camera.

479
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:31,025
Yeah. That works pretty quick,
doesn't it? Huh?

480
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:33,524
Well, maybe we got the
picture before it was burnt.

481
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:35,445
And if we did... if we did,

482
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:39,196
and that picture is in the camera,
and we can get ahold of the camera,

483
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:42,029
then we can be sitting
in New York...

484
00:34:42,122 --> 00:34:45,365
Sitting in New York,
eating, uh, sweet caviar.

485
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:48,451
Drinking champagne
out of goblets. Goblets.

486
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:50,286
Guard! There's a crazy man
in this cell!

487
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:53,043
Shut up! Shut up!

488
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:55,500
Harry, you are insane.

489
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:58,257
You don't know the first thing
about safe-cracking, Harry.

490
00:34:58,346 --> 00:34:59,427
What's to that?

491
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:01,506
There's nothing to it.
We can learn it in a minute.

492
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,388
Look, what is the difference
between us and Adam Worth?

493
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:07,345
A few breaks! Those plans
are worth a million bucks.

494
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:10,523
Oh, great. We can buy a couple
of expensive suits to get buried in.

495
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:13,443
This is it, Walter.
It's the big time.

496
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:16,145
No. The big time is Broadway, for me.
I'm not a thief!

497
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,571
We're gonna get blown to pieces!

498
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,239
We'll discuss your career
some other time.

499
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:20,908
Okay. Okay, okay.

500
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:23,077
So we get out of here, then what?
We don't know anybody.

501
00:35:23,163 --> 00:35:25,405
We don't have clothes.
We don't even have train fare.

502
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:27,114
We know Lissa Chestnut.

503
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:29,704
That's true.

504
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:33,458
Yeah, so, you let me worry
about the clothes.

505
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:35,585
You let me worry about
the train fare. Huh?

506
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,211
What do you say, Walter?

507
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:40,670
- I'll think about it.
- Oh, come on. Please, Walter.

508
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:42,300
"Please, Walter."

509
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:47,093
- Maybe.
- Okay.

510
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,852
- Maybe.
- Okay.

511
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:54,400
Watch my pants!
I got nitro, you idiot!

512
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:57,896
Guard! A man is dying
in Cell Block Three!

513
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,355
- He's sick!
- Quiet up there!

514
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:01,190
Guard, please!
He's dying.

515
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:02,900
You okay?

516
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:06,283
- Please, hurry, guards!
- Harry, you're a louse.

517
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:07,659
What's wrong?

518
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:10,913
The man suddenly took ill.
Suddenly ill.

519
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,085
I don't know. Ow.

520
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:15,959
What's the matter with you?

521
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:17,506
I can't breathe.

522
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,387
We'll need these.

523
00:36:31,481 --> 00:36:32,813
I only said "maybe,"
Harry.

524
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:34,731
Maybe's good enough for me.
Come on.

525
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:50,489
Hold it.
Hold it right there.

526
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:53,334
This is nitro.

527
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,207
I just— This is nitro!

528
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:57,538
Let's get outta here,
Harry.

529
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:02,343
Captain! Captain!
They got some nitro.

530
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:04,637
Nitro!

531
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:07,557
Careful, Harry.
Don't fall with the nitro, Harry.

532
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:22,021
Let's go!

533
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:26,775
Take that back.
Let's go!

534
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:31,326
Let go of it. Come on.
Let's go!

535
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:36,251
- Don't jiggle it.
- I'm not jiggling it! I gotta run!

536
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:37,293
Who's jiggling it?

537
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,507
Just don't drop that,
Harry.

538
00:37:43,136 --> 00:37:44,547
I'm not dropping it.

539
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,135
- Don't jiggle that, Harry!
- I'm trying.

540
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:50,841
Watch the coal, Harry.
Don't drop it.

541
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,892
Oh! I'm slipping!

542
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:57,640
- Come on.
- Don't drop it, Harry.

543
00:37:57,734 --> 00:38:00,477
- Harry!
- Harry, Harry!

544
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:02,482
Walter, Walter!
Hold it, hold it!

545
00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:05,690
Harry, it'll explode.
What are we gonna do now?

546
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:08,652
Put those guns down!
Get off that wall!

547
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:10,611
They got nitro! Nitro!

548
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,071
We'll talk it out.

549
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:15,784
Get off! Get off!
He's got nitro! Don't shoot!

550
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:16,958
Harry, don't dare him!

551
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:18,126
Come on! I dare him.

552
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:20,671
Harry, don't!

553
00:38:20,757 --> 00:38:21,838
Come on!

554
00:38:21,925 --> 00:38:24,884
- We'll go back—
- Come on!

555
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:27,086
Put me on a nitro detail, will ya?

556
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,716
- Don't threaten him.
- Say, "I'm too smart."

557
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:30,799
- I'm too smart.
- No! I'm too smart.

558
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:33,054
- You're too smart!
- Watch this. Ha!

559
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,430
- No, don't!
- Ha!

560
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:35,887
- Don't!
- Harry!

561
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,972
- Whoa!
- Sweet Jesus!

562
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:41,817
Well? Come on!

563
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:48,198
My hat!

564
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:49,866
What do you mean,
your hat?

565
00:38:49,953 --> 00:38:51,489
- I dropped my hat.
- Your hat?

566
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:52,820
You stupid!

567
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,877
Watch the quarters!

568
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:10,463
Got 'em.

569
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:15,100
Those dogs are gonna find us,
Harry.

570
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,553
If there's one thing I know, it's dogs.
Just follow me.

571
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:19,764
- What do we do?
- We'll throw 'em off.

572
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:24,732
Run around the tree.
Rub your body on the tree.

573
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:27,279
Get 'em dizzy.
Okay, come on.

574
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,823
Trust me, Walter.
Come on.

575
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:31,866
- Harry, I'm hungry, Harry.
- We'll eat later.

576
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,125
Come on.

577
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,419
They'll give us years,
Harry!

578
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:43,495
Come on.

579
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:45,673
Harry,
they're gonna catch us.

580
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:48,125
They've got snakes in the forest,
Harry.

581
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,380
I'm scared.

582
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:53,134
Come on. Come on.
Okay, this way. Walter?

583
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,385
Harry?

584
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:58,010
- Harry!
- Walter?

585
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:01,764
- Harry?
- Walter?

586
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:04,942
- Harry? Harry, I'm lost!
- Don't panic!

587
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:06,815
- Harry? Harry?
- Don't panic!

588
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:10,106
- I got lost.
- Okay.

589
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:12,361
- I got lost in the corn.
- Okay!

590
00:40:12,452 --> 00:40:14,739
Shh. Let me explain
something to you.

591
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:16,946
If I'm in the front,
that means you...

592
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,955
I've never liked corn.
Let's get outta here.

593
00:40:22,045 --> 00:40:23,957
You're supposed to
be behind me.

594
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:25,333
Don't holler at me,
Harry.

595
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,790
If I'm leading,
that means you follow.

596
00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:30,968
If you follow—
you know what I mean.

597
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:40,178
A bicycle.
We can use a bicycle.

598
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:41,728
Be careful.

599
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:44,310
Timing is everything.

600
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:52,906
We're dangerous!
We escaped! We're convicts!

601
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,403
Run for your life.

602
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:55,610
Run!

603
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:59,913
Okay, let's go.

604
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,502
Harry,
my legs are getting tired.

605
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:06,578
Don't worry.

606
00:41:06,673 --> 00:41:09,040
When we get to Connecticut,
it's mostly downhill.

607
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:11,045
Attaboy.

608
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:14,048
Attaboy. Attaboy.
Come on.

609
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:16,676
Here. Come on.

610
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:29,769
All these years, I told you
I'd get you here, right?

611
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:31,069
Okay.

612
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:38,493
Beep, beep.

613
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,366
Hey! Thank you.

614
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:47,836
Watch out!
Watch out.

615
00:41:49,549 --> 00:41:50,710
Oh, look!

616
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:54,293
Oh, gosh.

617
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:56,629
Oh! Get off me!

618
00:41:56,723 --> 00:41:58,214
You all right?
Come on.

619
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:00,594
We made it.

620
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:03,348
- Harry, we made it. We're here.
- Where are we?

621
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:06,772
The <i>Advocate, the People's Newspaper,</i>
Harry. 184 miles. We made it!

622
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:09,066
This is it?
That's some newspaper.

623
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:15,860
You got the magnifying glass?

624
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:18,033
I think it's by the bed.

625
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:26,200
Lemon or milk?

626
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:28,251
- Well, both, if you have 'em.
- Both.

627
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:32,293
I'm gonna take these off
because they pinch my muscles.

628
00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:38,721
Um, I'm so surprised.
I'm really stunned to see you here.

629
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:39,762
How did you...

630
00:42:39,849 --> 00:42:42,842
Well, you can imagine
our surprise when, uh...

631
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:44,892
An hour after you left,

632
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:46,766
our parole came through,
bang, like that.

633
00:42:46,856 --> 00:42:48,518
More like "boom."

634
00:42:48,608 --> 00:42:50,520
Boom, bang, what difference
does it make?

635
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:56,522
We came as soon as we could,
and so how can we best help you?

636
00:42:56,616 --> 00:42:59,950
Oh! Uh, that's very
thoughtful of you both.

637
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:04,163
It's just that I'm afraid
we can't pay you anything.

638
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:05,489
Nothing at all.

639
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,040
- Oh, we don't care about money.
- Oh, I mean, money. Money.

640
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:15,045
We came because, uh,
we just...

641
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:18,593
wanted to put a new, uh, life
in our direction, like you said.

642
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:21,513
- A new direction in our life.
- That's what I said, Walter.

643
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,387
- It's wonderful. It's inspiring.
- It's perfect.

644
00:43:24,477 --> 00:43:26,184
It's perfect.
Yes, it is. Here.

645
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:30,059
I want you to take a look at this,
and I want you to tell me what you think.

646
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:32,983
Be honest.
Think it'll sell?

647
00:43:33,069 --> 00:43:34,651
"Adam Worth,
penitentiary prince."

648
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:35,727
"Adam Worth."

649
00:43:35,822 --> 00:43:37,939
Oh, boy, is he
gonna be mad.

650
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:40,858
You have pictures of us
in here!

651
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:42,693
Look at that, Harry.

652
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:44,119
Yeah.

653
00:43:44,205 --> 00:43:46,538
Oh, this is good publicity,
Walter.

654
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,365
- You think so?
- Yeah.

655
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:52,795
Excuse me.
Lewis?

656
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:00,044
- You're terrific!
- Oh, thanks.

657
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:01,254
They're wonderful.

658
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:02,963
- Sharp and clear.
- Yes.

659
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:04,673
Where do you develop these?

660
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:06,099
I got my own darkroom.

661
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:08,097
- Here?
- Yeah, right here.

662
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:10,554
- You're kidding.
- No, no, I'll show you. Come on.

663
00:44:11,107 --> 00:44:12,598
Come here.

664
00:44:15,528 --> 00:44:16,939
Aw, it's a boy.

665
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:18,440
Yeah.

666
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:20,443
You do wonderful,
wonderful work.

667
00:44:20,533 --> 00:44:22,069
Thank you.

668
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,742
It's a... characteristic.

669
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:25,285
Well, a character study.

670
00:44:26,164 --> 00:44:27,496
It's wonderful.

671
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:32,459
Oh, uh...

672
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:36,413
Lewis,
what's this pile here?

673
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:38,499
- Oh, those are the rejects.
- Uh-huh.

674
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:41,757
Your friend Walter
took the worst one of 'em all.

675
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:43,132
He did? Which one was that?

676
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:45,305
Which one? The one that
almost burned down the cell.

677
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:48,429
I don't mean
to be personal,

678
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:51,353
but you're not related to him,
are you?

679
00:44:53,149 --> 00:44:54,640
- No.
- Oh.

680
00:44:54,734 --> 00:44:56,896
This is the worst picture
I've ever seen in my life.

681
00:44:56,986 --> 00:44:58,318
Look at this.

682
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:01,272
It's just a bunch of crazy diagrams.
The composition is terrible.

683
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:04,574
Look, the leg is cut off,
your whole body's cut off.

684
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:41,528
- Paper! The <i>Advocate!</i>
- Lewis Hopkins' photographs!

685
00:45:41,614 --> 00:45:44,197
Corruption here
in New York!

686
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:46,821
Walter, take a stack
and spread 'em all over town.

687
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:48,868
When you've sold these,
come back for more.

688
00:45:48,955 --> 00:45:51,789
Listen. One per customer.

689
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:53,706
They'll buy anything
that's one to a customer.

690
00:45:53,793 --> 00:45:55,625
One to a customer.

691
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:01,210
- Paper.
- Oh.

692
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,132
- What?
- Look.

693
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:05,427
What's the matter, Harry?
What?

694
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:08,259
- Shang Draper's.
- Shang what?

695
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:11,092
Shang Draper's.

696
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:12,175
It's a restaurant.

697
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:16,685
Yeah. Do you know that right now
the greatest cracksmen in the world

698
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:20,609
are sitting there, and they're,
uh, lightin' cigars with C-notes.

699
00:46:20,695 --> 00:46:23,233
That's the way they talk.
C-note, that's a hundred.

700
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:26,815
- Oh, my God.
- Who's that?

701
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:28,866
- Oh, my God.
- Who do you see?

702
00:46:28,953 --> 00:46:30,114
Oh, my God.

703
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:32,571
Harry, what's the matter?
Who do you see?

704
00:46:32,665 --> 00:46:35,373
- That's piano Charley Bullard!
- Who?

705
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:38,827
Charley Bullard.
The diamond job in Paris!

706
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:42,414
Paris. That's Paris, France.
That's— It's near Europe and Asia.

707
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:44,465
- So?
- The— So?

708
00:46:44,552 --> 00:46:46,885
The Charley diamond Bullard job
in Paris, France!

709
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:47,961
Where are we going?

710
00:46:53,686 --> 00:46:55,803
Oh. Sorry about that.

711
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:10,409
Mrs. Trumble, Mr. Trumble.
Enjoy your meal.

712
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:18,959
Excuse me. I'd like, uh, a nice table
by the window for two, please.

713
00:47:19,045 --> 00:47:22,834
I'm afraid it's out of the question, sir.
We are fully booked.

714
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:26,128
That's all right.
We'll wait.

715
00:47:27,136 --> 00:47:30,379
I'm afraid it would be at least two hours.
Probably three.

716
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:35,808
Oh, well, I'll, uh...

717
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:40,313
see your three
and raise you two.

718
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:42,891
Sir, this is
Shang Draper's.

719
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:45,477
I'm not lookin' for directions, buddy.
I just want a table.

720
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:47,813
One moment, sir.

721
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:50,615
And a nice one too.
Right over there by the window.

722
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:53,193
Harry, isn't that Jack Chatsworth
sitting over there?

723
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:54,903
- Jack— Where?
- There, in the middle...

724
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:56,488
Don't point!

725
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:58,744
Harry, if I don't point,
how am I gonna show you...

726
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:01,542
You describe it.
You use the English language, like me.

727
00:48:01,629 --> 00:48:05,043
May I help you,
uh... gentlemen?

728
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:07,294
No. No, thanks.

729
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:11,879
Um, Jack!
Jack Chatsworth!

730
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:12,928
- Harry—
- How ya...

731
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:15,302
- How ya doin', buddy?
- Christ, Harry!

732
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:18,601
You're friends
of Mr. Chatsworth.

733
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,803
Oh, yeah.

734
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:21,479
I thought you'd never ask.

735
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:29,104
Right this way,
gentlemen.

736
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:45,454
It's not— Not a window.

737
00:48:49,552 --> 00:48:50,918
It's all right.

738
00:48:53,264 --> 00:48:54,471
Thank you.

739
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:02,471
Are you trying to get us
killed, Harry?

740
00:49:02,565 --> 00:49:05,182
Relax. Adam Worth is safely
tucked away in that prison.

741
00:49:07,278 --> 00:49:10,817
Something from the bar, gentlemen?
Would you like to look at the wine list?

742
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:13,816
Yes, thank you.

743
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:15,116
Here it is, sir.

744
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:21,744
Uh, some beer.

745
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:26,369
Beer.

746
00:49:34,847 --> 00:49:36,213
Um...

747
00:49:36,307 --> 00:49:38,344
Chateau Lafite-Rothschild, '79.

748
00:49:39,894 --> 00:49:41,351
An excellent selection,
monsieur.

749
00:49:41,437 --> 00:49:45,181
Measurably. Oh, and, uh, excuse me.
Would you send a bottle of the same

750
00:49:45,274 --> 00:49:47,391
to Mr. Chatsworth's table
with my compliments.

751
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:49,147
Yes, sir.

752
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:51,603
And, uh, two large salads.

753
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:52,938
Very good, sir.

754
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:56,863
Harry, this must be
a very expensive restaurant.

755
00:49:58,287 --> 00:49:59,448
After we bust that bank,

756
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:01,951
we're gonna be eating lunch here
for the rest of our lives.

757
00:50:02,041 --> 00:50:03,657
You're crazy, Harry.

758
00:50:04,293 --> 00:50:07,582
You've been saying that
a long time, but, uh, here we are.

759
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:42,282
Thank you.

760
00:51:32,965 --> 00:51:35,332
Walter, Walter, wait a minute.
Put it down.

761
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:38,423
Have a little class.
You gotta air it out. Air it out.

762
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:40,924
That's it.
Okay, now.

763
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:43,347
Ah. Good luck.

764
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:54,768
- Ahhh.
- Ah.

765
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:14,124
George.

766
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:26,057
Jack, how are you?

767
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:27,350
Great.

768
00:52:28,604 --> 00:52:30,095
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

769
00:52:30,189 --> 00:52:32,522
Thank you so much
for such a wonderful welcome.

770
00:52:32,608 --> 00:52:35,942
It's nice to be back among friends.
How are you, Jack?

771
00:52:36,028 --> 00:52:38,395
Adam, I was worried.
You're late.

772
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:39,900
Now I understand why.

773
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,691
Nice to see you again,
Miss Fontaine.

774
00:52:42,785 --> 00:52:44,492
- Nice to see you too.
- Please.

775
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:46,319
Red, you sit over there,
will you please?

776
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:47,779
Waiter?

777
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:50,490
Adam, I believe
you've met the young ladies.

778
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:54,544
Yes, quite some time ago,
I think. Hello, hello.

779
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:56,917
Maybe he won't recognize us
in these clothes.

780
00:52:57,508 --> 00:52:58,464
Maybe.

781
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:02,669
Adam, I think
you'd like to see this.

782
00:53:04,223 --> 00:53:06,886
"Adam Worth,
penitentiary prince."

783
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:08,932
He's looking at the newspaper now,
the <i>Advocate.</i>

784
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:12,638
With the pictures of us and
the pictures of him being the prince.

785
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:17,146
Eight pages of pictures and captions.
Each one nastier than the last.

786
00:53:17,236 --> 00:53:20,354
They even have a picture of those
two idiots that burnt the plans.

787
00:53:20,948 --> 00:53:25,989
That underhanded, conniving,
delicious young lady.

788
00:53:26,078 --> 00:53:28,445
- We gotta get outta here.
- Where's the waiter?

789
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:30,872
I'd get out of here
except for the stupid waiters!

790
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:34,079
Um... check, please.

791
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:36,752
- Anything wrong, sir?
- No, please give me a check.

792
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:40,464
Thank you.
Oh, hey, mister?

793
00:53:40,551 --> 00:53:42,508
Mister? Sir, sir?

794
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:44,176
He's gonna give 'em
the wine.

795
00:53:46,557 --> 00:53:48,219
Excuse me, Mr. Chatsworth,

796
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:50,891
compliments of
your friend at table seven.

797
00:53:50,978 --> 00:53:52,264
Open it.

798
00:53:55,816 --> 00:53:58,103
- Would you stop it?
- They're looking right over here.

799
00:53:58,193 --> 00:53:59,183
Stop it.

800
00:53:59,278 --> 00:54:01,941
I haven't the slightest idea
who they are.

801
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:03,316
Harry Dighby.

802
00:54:04,408 --> 00:54:06,149
And Walter Hill.

803
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:09,318
Red.

804
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:16,701
I think it's time to go.

805
00:54:24,136 --> 00:54:25,968
Wait a minute.

806
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:28,258
The fire.

807
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:31,470
A picture.

808
00:54:32,853 --> 00:54:35,095
They took a picture.

809
00:54:35,898 --> 00:54:39,312
Brilliant.

810
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:53,325
Look, we'll stay in here
till after dark.

811
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:55,748
You found the plans,
didn't you, Harry?

812
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:57,200
No, no, no, no.

813
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:59,752
Look me in the eye and tell me
you don't have the plans.

814
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:01,830
Right in the eye.

815
00:55:01,924 --> 00:55:04,632
I don't have the plans.

816
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:07,631
I knew it, Harry!
Please give him back the plans.

817
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:09,883
It'll be better than
ten letters of apology.

818
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:11,054
Give him back...

819
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:14,305
we're as good as Adam Worth.

820
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:15,680
You're gonna get us killed.

821
00:55:15,771 --> 00:55:17,433
- I'm gonna get us rich.
- You're gonna get us rich?

822
00:55:17,523 --> 00:55:20,391
Yes. Let's just watch the show.
Come on.

823
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:30,696
Watch the cat.

824
00:55:30,786 --> 00:55:32,118
Oh, it's a dog.

825
00:55:35,916 --> 00:55:38,408
Harry, remember, I don't wanna
see any of these people get hurt.

826
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:40,835
Hurt? We're gonna
buy 'em a new press.

827
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:45,715
We'll buy 'em— We'll buy 'em a new paper,
maybe the <i>New York Times.</i>

828
00:55:45,801 --> 00:55:47,793
Whoop. Watch yourself.
Watch yourself.

829
00:55:50,264 --> 00:55:51,755
Shh, shh.

830
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:58,310
Oh, my God!

831
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:02,390
Harry, this is terrible.

832
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:06,819
- It looks like a big typhoid hit here.
- Everything's wrecked.

833
00:56:08,574 --> 00:56:11,692
Lissa? Lissa?

834
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:14,489
Excuse me, uh...

835
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:19,949
Charley, that
is downright greedy.

836
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:22,000
The house
is reimbursing me.

837
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,588
How are you doing in there?
Are you doing all right?

838
00:56:25,674 --> 00:56:29,714
- I lost everything.
- Wh-What? Who's here?

839
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:33,137
Please. Ladies and gentlemen,
one moment please.

840
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:34,885
Could I have your
attention please?

841
00:56:34,975 --> 00:56:36,682
Could I have
your attention please?

842
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:41,221
In case their reputation
has not preceded them,

843
00:56:41,315 --> 00:56:44,729
may I introduce you
to the most infamous new addition

844
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:47,185
to the ranks of the stellar
underworld elite:

845
00:56:47,279 --> 00:56:50,067
the Dighby, Hill,
Chestnut ring.

846
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:52,240
Mr. Worth, if you would be
so kind as to tell me

847
00:56:52,326 --> 00:56:53,988
just what it is
you want with us.

848
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:55,864
Please allow me
to show you.

849
00:57:01,752 --> 00:57:04,165
Sit on the corner of it,
darling. This one.

850
00:57:07,633 --> 00:57:11,092
Everybody find yourself a seat
and make yourself comfortable.

851
00:57:12,054 --> 00:57:15,388
Fill these ones up. Look,
there's some empty ones here.

852
00:57:15,474 --> 00:57:18,683
Now, tonight the plan was
to have a lecture...

853
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:22,103
Excuse me. Mr. Worth.

854
00:57:23,315 --> 00:57:26,524
I, uh, think we can still
work something out.

855
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:30,107
After all,
we still do have the plans.

856
00:57:30,197 --> 00:57:32,154
What is all this discussion
about plans?

857
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:35,574
Would you give Mr. Worth back the plans?
Just give him back the plans.

858
00:57:35,661 --> 00:57:37,527
Will you please
tell me...

859
00:57:37,621 --> 00:57:38,828
We can work it out.

860
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:43,074
Now, Adam...

861
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:48,170
what arrangements
would you like to make?

862
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:54,544
Cash now, or we can help you
do the job and split 50-50.

863
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:56,842
You pathetic clown.

864
00:57:58,308 --> 00:57:59,799
Did you really think
for one instant

865
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:01,885
that you could pull a job
the magnitude

866
00:58:01,979 --> 00:58:03,936
of the Commercial Bank
and Trust Company

867
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:05,934
of Lowell,
Massachusetts?

868
00:58:06,024 --> 00:58:08,016
- All right, cash now?
- Look around you.

869
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:11,143
Look at the men in this room.

870
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,613
They've engineered robberies
three years in the making.

871
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:15,861
Everybody here is an engineer.

872
00:58:15,951 --> 00:58:17,237
Excuse me, Mr. Worth.

873
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:19,819
My family's waiting dinner.
I have little kids at home.

874
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:22,121
Mr. Finley, come with me.

875
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:27,661
Now, our after-dinner entertainment
this evening was to have been a lecture

876
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:31,998
by Mr. Finley
on the inner workings of this.

877
00:58:32,092 --> 00:58:33,549
Sit down, boys.

878
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:38,300
A brand-new safe.

879
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:41,014
Oh, nice.

880
00:58:41,101 --> 00:58:42,967
Equipped...

881
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:46,353
with the very latest...

882
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:49,308
double-pressure system.

883
00:58:52,696 --> 00:58:56,030
But since we are in the presence
of such estimable authorities

884
00:58:56,116 --> 00:58:58,984
on the subject of cracksmanship
as these...

885
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:02,616
I thought it might
be more entertaining...

886
00:59:02,706 --> 00:59:04,413
No offense,
Mr. Finley...

887
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:09,164
If they were to demonstrate to us
the various methods of penetrating it.

888
00:59:11,631 --> 00:59:13,167
And just to make it interesting...

889
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:16,626
don't you think it might be amusing

890
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:20,259
to place something of
some insignificant value inside?

891
00:59:21,349 --> 00:59:23,090
- Mmm?
- Oh, yeah, nice.

892
00:59:23,185 --> 00:59:26,804
Like for instance... Mr. Hill.

893
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:29,555
- Mr. Worth, this joke...
- Me?

894
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:31,311
...has gone far enough!

895
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:33,142
Harry, where
are those plans?

896
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:34,898
- I don't remember.
- Don't play around.

897
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:36,945
Please give him the plans.

898
00:59:37,032 --> 00:59:41,572
- Get in!
- Oh, well...

899
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:45,154
Well, I don't feel like, uh...

900
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:48,958
I'm a large person.
I wouldn't fit in there.

901
00:59:49,044 --> 00:59:50,876
You should have
a smaller person like him.

902
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:52,669
That's cruel.

903
00:59:52,756 --> 00:59:55,544
Red.

904
00:59:55,634 --> 00:59:57,751
- I'm not gonna get in that safe.
- Red.

905
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:03,381
Get in the safe, Walter.

906
01:00:03,475 --> 01:00:05,262
Oh, no, I'm not
getting in that safe.

907
01:00:05,352 --> 01:00:07,059
Get in!

908
01:00:07,145 --> 01:00:09,137
Very well.

909
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:15,688
Now, Mr. Dighby,

910
01:00:15,779 --> 01:00:20,149
one of the most attractive features
of the double-pressure system...

911
01:00:22,202 --> 01:00:24,034
Harry, would you please give him
the plans?

912
01:00:24,121 --> 01:00:25,703
Don't worry, I'll handle it.

913
01:00:25,789 --> 01:00:29,453
...is that it makes the inside
of the safe... airtight.

914
01:00:31,128 --> 01:00:32,084
Completely...

915
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:36,081
airtight.

916
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:37,790
It's dark in here!

917
01:00:37,884 --> 01:00:41,423
Please feel free, Mr. Dighby,
to use any tools that may be lying around.

918
01:00:41,513 --> 01:00:46,053
There are quite a few over there.
But... while you work,

919
01:00:46,143 --> 01:00:48,886
you might begin thinking
about telling me

920
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:51,596
where you put the photograph
of my bank plans.

921
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:54,023
My God, Mr. Worth,
he'll die in there!

922
01:00:54,109 --> 01:00:56,146
There's not even 20 minutes
of air in there.

923
01:00:56,236 --> 01:00:58,694
Sixteen, to be exact, Mr. Finley.

924
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:01,363
We tried it with a chicken
this afternoon,

925
01:01:01,449 --> 01:01:02,735
but then, of course,

926
01:01:02,826 --> 01:01:06,035
Mr. Hill might breathe a little heavier
than a chicken, mightn't he?

927
01:01:06,788 --> 01:01:07,904
Harry!

928
01:01:07,998 --> 01:01:11,241
Away you go, Mr. Dighby.
Yes, go on.

929
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:17,246
Take this.

930
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:22,635
You put it in there
and just bang it hard.

931
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:31,761
I do not believe that I am watching
this barbaric act of sadistic cruelty.

932
01:01:31,855 --> 01:01:35,519
Walter, breathe slowly.
Only every 30 seconds.

933
01:01:35,609 --> 01:01:37,817
Harry, would you
give him the plans?

934
01:01:38,904 --> 01:01:41,146
How's it coming along,
Mr. Dighby?

935
01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:43,151
Harry?

936
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:46,530
All right, all right,
Mr. Worth.

937
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:50,946
We'll play it your way
this time.

938
01:01:52,918 --> 01:01:54,375
I'll get you the plans.
You win.

939
01:02:36,044 --> 01:02:37,535
I hate myself.

940
01:02:39,673 --> 01:02:41,380
Oh, that's perfect.

941
01:02:42,926 --> 01:02:45,043
Keep breathing slowly,
Walter.

942
01:02:46,554 --> 01:02:48,090
I'm coming.

943
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,683
Open the door!

944
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:06,697
Ah, Mr. Dighby.

945
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:12,453
But you're soaking wet,
Mr. Dighby.

946
01:03:12,539 --> 01:03:13,871
Yes, well...

947
01:03:15,542 --> 01:03:17,875
It's very muggy outside.

948
01:03:17,961 --> 01:03:20,669
Very strange for this time
of the year.

949
01:03:21,506 --> 01:03:23,919
Well,
the plans are yours.

950
01:03:27,053 --> 01:03:28,919
- Can you, uh— Mr. Finley?
- Mr. Finley.

951
01:03:29,848 --> 01:03:32,056
Hurry. Hurry.

952
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:41,311
Walter! Oh, no!
Oh, can you breathe?

953
01:03:41,401 --> 01:03:45,065
Can you— Oh!

954
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:48,022
Oh, give him some air.

955
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:50,608
You!

956
01:03:51,453 --> 01:03:52,534
You!

957
01:03:55,874 --> 01:04:00,494
No! Stop it!
Stop it! Please!

958
01:04:00,587 --> 01:04:02,795
Stop it!
This is enough!

959
01:04:02,881 --> 01:04:05,589
That's enough!
Mr. Worth, I appeal to you.

960
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:08,964
Haven't we seen enough
senseless violence for one night?

961
01:04:09,054 --> 01:04:11,296
She's right, boys.
She's right, she's right.

962
01:04:11,389 --> 01:04:13,722
Pick them up,
and see them to the door.

963
01:04:19,314 --> 01:04:20,521
Gentlemen!

964
01:04:20,607 --> 01:04:22,439
I'm not through
with you yet!

965
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:24,266
Please, please.

966
01:04:24,361 --> 01:04:25,647
Please.

967
01:04:28,323 --> 01:04:29,734
Now, get them out
of my sight.

968
01:04:29,824 --> 01:04:31,907
One moment!
One moment, Mr. Worth.

969
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:33,863
One moment.

970
01:04:33,953 --> 01:04:36,320
Mr. Worth, when someone
comes into my life

971
01:04:36,414 --> 01:04:39,248
and deliberately smashes everything
that I've worked for,

972
01:04:39,334 --> 01:04:42,543
well, I feel a definite
and irrevocable responsibility

973
01:04:42,629 --> 01:04:44,165
to kick that someone back.

974
01:04:46,174 --> 01:04:49,838
Ohh, when I—
Oh, and, and...

975
01:04:49,928 --> 01:04:52,170
And make no mistake
about it, Mr. Worth.

976
01:04:52,263 --> 01:04:53,595
Make no mistake about it.

977
01:04:53,681 --> 01:04:56,344
Oh, yes, indeed,
you fancy yourself an intellectual,

978
01:04:56,434 --> 01:04:58,096
a colorful scoundrel.

979
01:04:58,186 --> 01:05:01,395
Well, you are not a scoundrel,
Mr. Worth! You are a waste!

980
01:05:01,481 --> 01:05:04,565
You are a pitiful waste,
and I intend to stamp you out

981
01:05:04,651 --> 01:05:07,940
with the same compassion
that I have witnessed here tonight!

982
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:10,271
And as for you two...

983
01:05:11,282 --> 01:05:12,898
pretending to believe in our cause

984
01:05:12,992 --> 01:05:15,700
when all the while
your only purpose was to use us...

985
01:05:15,787 --> 01:05:17,870
I have nothing but contempt.

986
01:05:17,956 --> 01:05:19,492
We accepted you as brothers,

987
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:22,825
and in return have been humiliated
at the feet of vermin.

988
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:24,751
Our dreams have been shattered,

989
01:05:24,838 --> 01:05:27,330
but more important,
you have broken our hearts.

990
01:05:27,424 --> 01:05:29,290
Harry, you're rotten!
I'm gonna thrash you.

991
01:05:29,384 --> 01:05:30,465
Oh, yeah?

992
01:05:30,552 --> 01:05:33,215
Stop it, both of you!
Stop it!

993
01:05:33,304 --> 01:05:35,546
Stop it! If you must
kill each other, do it later,

994
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:37,597
- but for now I need you.
- What for?

995
01:05:37,684 --> 01:05:39,641
For the Commercial Bank
of Lowell, Massachusetts.

996
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:44,013
Adam Worth intends to rob that bank,
but we're going to beat him to it!

997
01:05:44,107 --> 01:05:47,100
I will not allow that money
to be used for loose women,

998
01:05:47,193 --> 01:05:50,903
for ruffled skirts and maintenance
of a princely way of life

999
01:05:50,989 --> 01:05:52,776
that should have been abolished
centuries ago.

1000
01:05:53,533 --> 01:05:56,776
Not while children cry out for milk
in the streets below us.

1001
01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:59,408
If that bank has to be robbed,
then by God,

1002
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:01,955
let it be robbed
in the name of decency!

1003
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:04,374
Let that money be taken
from the exploiters who put it there

1004
01:06:04,461 --> 01:06:06,202
and returned to the people
who need it!

1005
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:10,791
All right, all those in favor
of robbing this bank say aye!

1006
01:06:10,884 --> 01:06:12,750
Aye!

1007
01:06:12,844 --> 01:06:16,337
Now we are all—
every single one of us, and you too...

1008
01:06:16,431 --> 01:06:18,844
are going to Massachusetts,
by God!

1009
01:06:18,933 --> 01:06:20,799
I don't know how
we're gonna do this,

1010
01:06:20,894 --> 01:06:23,637
but we are going to crack
the toughest bank in America!

1011
01:07:47,605 --> 01:07:49,813
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- What's the matter with you?

1012
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:51,856
You young people today
have no respect.

1013
01:07:51,943 --> 01:07:52,979
I have a heavy bag.

1014
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:54,605
Well, get rid
of the heavy bag!

1015
01:07:54,696 --> 01:07:57,279
What's the matter with you, driver?
Can't you wait till I sit down?

1016
01:07:57,365 --> 01:07:58,731
How long you worked for me?

1017
01:07:58,825 --> 01:08:01,112
How many times did I tell you
don't start while I'm standing?

1018
01:08:01,202 --> 01:08:02,943
When I'm talking,
you wait till I get down.

1019
01:08:04,998 --> 01:08:08,116
Well, I finally see
you got here, Mr. Smith.

1020
01:08:08,209 --> 01:08:11,668
Well, it's a long walk
from the railroad station, Miss Jones,

1021
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:14,246
and these samples are heavy.

1022
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:17,003
- Did you get everything?
- Everything.

1023
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:27,389
The special knock.

1024
01:08:30,356 --> 01:08:31,938
- Did you get the drills?
- I got 'em.

1025
01:08:32,025 --> 01:08:33,232
Oh, good.

1026
01:08:34,402 --> 01:08:36,189
You got 'em all?

1027
01:08:39,032 --> 01:08:40,273
Wonderful.

1028
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:43,530
Drills, I mean, they're very important
when it comes to opening a safe.

1029
01:08:44,412 --> 01:08:47,655
Opening a safe is not very easy,

1030
01:08:47,749 --> 01:08:49,957
so I want everyone
to pay careful attention.

1031
01:08:50,043 --> 01:08:52,956
First, I will turn
the combination...

1032
01:08:54,172 --> 01:08:58,758
uh, listening with my ear
to the door.

1033
01:08:59,427 --> 01:09:01,464
And when I hear or feel

1034
01:09:01,554 --> 01:09:06,015
the right clicks
with my fingertips,

1035
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:10,185
then... good, good.

1036
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:12,012
If not,
we go right to the dynamite.

1037
01:09:13,191 --> 01:09:15,308
Now, um,

1038
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:17,108
whose turn is it
to dig?

1039
01:09:17,195 --> 01:09:18,185
We have a schedule.

1040
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:19,235
Check the...

1041
01:09:19,322 --> 01:09:23,612
Okay, Harry and Lissa
are doing the digging.

1042
01:09:23,701 --> 01:09:25,784
Walter is removing
the dirt.

1043
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:28,954
I'm gonna do the laundry,
and the rest of us can sleep.

1044
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:31,953
I will take Lissa's turn.
Harry and I will dig.

1045
01:09:32,043 --> 01:09:33,659
Lissa, you get some rest.

1046
01:09:33,753 --> 01:09:36,291
That's very gallant of you,
but actually I feel as though...

1047
01:09:36,381 --> 01:09:40,751
- Gallant!
- I have to do what's in my heart.

1048
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:41,879
That's not gallant!

1049
01:09:41,969 --> 01:09:44,131
I mean, he's afraid of us
being alone in that closet.

1050
01:09:44,222 --> 01:09:46,805
How dare you!
That's a lie, that's not true.

1051
01:09:46,891 --> 01:09:48,757
Walter, I can read you
like a book.

1052
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:52,094
You can? When did you
learn to read, Harry?

1053
01:10:19,382 --> 01:10:20,873
Get your hands off...

1054
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:35,937
Shh! Come on in.
Get the equipment.

1055
01:10:36,023 --> 01:10:37,980
- Harry—
- Harry Dighby.

1056
01:10:39,318 --> 01:10:41,355
Give me that.
Stop it.

1057
01:10:41,446 --> 01:10:42,903
You're mad!

1058
01:10:42,989 --> 01:10:44,696
You get some sleep.

1059
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:48,401
Shh.

1060
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:53,906
Please, do you mind?

1061
01:11:00,923 --> 01:11:02,164
Grow up.

1062
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:03,749
What? He started it.

1063
01:11:03,843 --> 01:11:06,335
"He started it."
Give me the tools.

1064
01:11:09,599 --> 01:11:11,807
He makes me so angry.

1065
01:11:11,893 --> 01:11:13,634
There's no time
for getting angry.

1066
01:11:13,728 --> 01:11:15,219
He started it.

1067
01:11:16,481 --> 01:11:18,564
I'm so sick of hearing
about you two.

1068
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:30,322
Mr. Crisp, I do so appreciate
your taking time after banking hours

1069
01:11:30,411 --> 01:11:33,245
to discuss
my very real predicament.

1070
01:11:33,331 --> 01:11:36,540
The prime responsibility
of any bank is to

1071
01:11:36,626 --> 01:11:39,585
service its customers at any hour
of the day or night.

1072
01:11:44,717 --> 01:11:46,003
What was that?

1073
01:11:46,093 --> 01:11:48,585
It's probably Walter coming in
for the dirt.

1074
01:11:48,679 --> 01:11:51,422
No, it was the door,
it was the door.

1075
01:11:51,516 --> 01:11:53,257
Dear lady.

1076
01:12:05,696 --> 01:12:07,608
I'm sorry.
Did I hurt you?

1077
01:12:07,698 --> 01:12:12,443
Mr. Crisp, I insist you
treat me with respect.

1078
01:12:12,537 --> 01:12:17,282
I may be a lonely bankrupt widow,
but I am a lady.

1079
01:12:17,375 --> 01:12:19,116
That's not Walter.

1080
01:12:19,210 --> 01:12:23,580
Please forgive me.
Frightful accident. Frightening.

1081
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:30,673
Come. Sit, please.

1082
01:12:35,685 --> 01:12:38,143
I extend the loan.

1083
01:12:38,229 --> 01:12:40,767
Mr. Crisp... please!

1084
01:12:41,816 --> 01:12:43,148
Thirty days.

1085
01:12:43,234 --> 01:12:45,317
Someone
from the bank.

1086
01:12:45,403 --> 01:12:46,564
I knew that.

1087
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:50,818
- Come here.
- No, Mr. Crisp.

1088
01:12:50,908 --> 01:12:53,525
No. No, no!

1089
01:12:53,619 --> 01:12:54,609
Forty-five days.

1090
01:12:54,704 --> 01:12:56,821
Mr. Crisp, no. My God!

1091
01:12:56,914 --> 01:12:59,122
Can't you realize
the position that I'm in?

1092
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:00,289
Are you uncomfortable?

1093
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:02,333
Oh, Mr. Crisp, please!

1094
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:05,333
Sixty days,
but that's as far as I go.

1095
01:13:05,423 --> 01:13:07,961
May I please
have a drink of water?

1096
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:09,291
Of course.

1097
01:13:20,938 --> 01:13:22,179
Don't get mad at me.

1098
01:13:28,946 --> 01:13:31,154
- Harry, open the door.
- Go away.

1099
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:32,196
Go away.

1100
01:13:33,576 --> 01:13:35,067
Harry, what are you doing?

1101
01:13:35,161 --> 01:13:36,777
Go away.
You've got the wrong office.

1102
01:13:36,871 --> 01:13:39,705
Don't you disguise your voice.
I know you're in there. Open the door!

1103
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:41,827
- Is it your wife?
- My wife?

1104
01:13:41,918 --> 01:13:44,160
Why did I promise his mother
I'd take care of him?

1105
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:46,461
Harry, open this door,
or I'm gonna kick it in and choke you!

1106
01:13:46,547 --> 01:13:49,961
Hold it! Okay.

1107
01:13:50,927 --> 01:13:54,261
Six months. But I get to come
to the farm on Sundays.

1108
01:14:00,603 --> 01:14:02,970
Oh! Oh, I-I must have
the wrong office.

1109
01:14:03,064 --> 01:14:04,726
Get out. Get out!

1110
01:14:05,566 --> 01:14:07,307
What are they doing
in that closet?

1111
01:14:07,401 --> 01:14:08,357
Waiting.

1112
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:09,855
It'll take hours.

1113
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:12,688
Sit down.
Go on, sit down.

1114
01:14:13,658 --> 01:14:15,820
- God!
- Be patient.

1115
01:14:15,910 --> 01:14:19,745
Eat an apple.
Go ahead. Eat an apple.

1116
01:14:19,830 --> 01:14:22,413
When you finish that,
I got a pear.

1117
01:14:25,252 --> 01:14:26,242
God!

1118
01:14:26,337 --> 01:14:31,833
No! I want it notarized,
in my hand,

1119
01:14:31,926 --> 01:14:34,919
before we continue
this discussion.

1120
01:14:37,556 --> 01:14:39,798
You drive a hard bargain,
Mrs. Hawthorne.

1121
01:14:41,811 --> 01:14:44,679
All right.
Tomorrow evening.

1122
01:14:44,772 --> 01:14:46,934
First thing, same time,
same place.

1123
01:14:47,024 --> 01:14:47,980
Yes.

1124
01:14:48,067 --> 01:14:49,478
- Yes?
- Yes.

1125
01:14:54,865 --> 01:14:56,106
Right now I don't know

1126
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:58,908
whether I'd rather blow his vault
or burn down her barn.

1127
01:14:59,662 --> 01:15:01,153
I gotta figure this out.

1128
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:04,661
We got a real, real problem.
They're coming back tomorrow.

1129
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:06,241
So how we gonna dig?

1130
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:07,701
I'll take care of it.
I promise.

1131
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:11,918
How may I serve you,
Miss Forsythe?

1132
01:15:13,676 --> 01:15:15,463
As a...

1133
01:15:15,553 --> 01:15:18,842
As a recently bereaved,
but beloved mistress...

1134
01:15:20,141 --> 01:15:23,179
of a distinguished
gentleman of means,

1135
01:15:23,269 --> 01:15:27,183
I find myself the benefactress
of a large cash gift.

1136
01:15:27,273 --> 01:15:28,434
I must invest it quickly,

1137
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:30,891
otherwise the gentleman's relatives,
through legal means,

1138
01:15:30,985 --> 01:15:33,819
will attempt to take from me
what is morally mine.

1139
01:15:36,824 --> 01:15:39,362
I made the man happy,
Mr. Crisp.

1140
01:15:39,452 --> 01:15:42,661
Happy beyond
his wildest expectations.

1141
01:15:43,581 --> 01:15:45,368
The money is mine.

1142
01:15:48,669 --> 01:15:50,080
Of course it is.

1143
01:15:50,171 --> 01:15:52,663
Mr. Crisp,
would you...

1144
01:15:54,258 --> 01:15:56,466
Could you help me?

1145
01:15:56,552 --> 01:15:59,044
I would be
deeply appreciative.

1146
01:16:00,973 --> 01:16:02,009
I'm sorry.

1147
01:16:02,099 --> 01:16:06,343
Dear lady, I would
consider it a privilege.

1148
01:16:07,146 --> 01:16:09,980
Of course I will have to know
the complete details of all your affairs...

1149
01:16:10,066 --> 01:16:11,056
Oh!

1150
01:16:11,984 --> 01:16:13,350
No. I mean...

1151
01:16:13,444 --> 01:16:14,855
these...

1152
01:16:16,655 --> 01:16:18,567
delicate matters...

1153
01:16:18,657 --> 01:16:22,025
are best discussed
after banking hours.

1154
01:16:22,119 --> 01:16:24,406
I understand what you mean...

1155
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:27,872
monsieur.

1156
01:16:28,459 --> 01:16:30,121
I am at your disposal.

1157
01:16:31,504 --> 01:16:35,669
Shall we say...
supper tomorrow night?

1158
01:16:35,758 --> 01:16:38,296
Oh, no!
Why must we wait?

1159
01:16:38,385 --> 01:16:43,255
I was thinking
more like perhaps tonight?

1160
01:16:43,349 --> 01:16:46,387
Oh, please. Please.

1161
01:16:46,477 --> 01:16:48,093
- Tonight?
- Yes.

1162
01:16:50,356 --> 01:16:52,769
I shall rearrange
a previous appointment.

1163
01:16:52,858 --> 01:16:55,601
Good, I have tickets
to this evening's show.

1164
01:16:55,694 --> 01:16:57,777
We shall go together.
Ah!

1165
01:16:57,863 --> 01:17:00,401
Oh! Oh.

1166
01:17:02,535 --> 01:17:06,996
Oh. Oh, dear.
Oh, dear.

1167
01:17:07,081 --> 01:17:09,664
Well, perhaps then,

1168
01:17:10,376 --> 01:17:14,746
a late supper afterwards...
monsieur.

1169
01:17:18,092 --> 01:17:19,082
Yes.

1170
01:17:21,345 --> 01:17:22,756
<i>Enchante,</i> Miss Forsythe.

1171
01:17:22,847 --> 01:17:24,133
<i>Enchante.</i>

1172
01:17:24,223 --> 01:17:26,055
Until <i>ce soir,</i>
mam'selle.

1173
01:17:26,142 --> 01:17:27,223
<i>Ce soir.</i>

1174
01:17:27,309 --> 01:17:28,925
Good-bye, Mr. Crisp.

1175
01:17:33,899 --> 01:17:36,107
Remember,
tactfully, my handsome prince.

1176
01:17:36,193 --> 01:17:38,150
My daughter, Princess Flavia,
has announced,

1177
01:17:38,237 --> 01:17:41,230
she will have none other for her husband
but Prince Herbert,

1178
01:17:41,323 --> 01:17:43,986
whom she has not seen
since she was a child.

1179
01:17:44,076 --> 01:17:46,568
Oh, fear not, we will be gentle.

1180
01:17:46,662 --> 01:17:47,778
But persistent.

1181
01:17:47,872 --> 01:17:48,988
Remember,

1182
01:17:49,081 --> 01:17:52,199
if there is no male heir to the throne
by the time I die,

1183
01:17:52,293 --> 01:17:56,503
my kingdom will go to my evil brother
Prince Malcolm.

1184
01:17:58,257 --> 01:18:00,249
Oh, here she comes now.

1185
01:18:00,342 --> 01:18:01,753
Good luck, sirs.

1186
01:18:01,844 --> 01:18:03,460
Thank you, sire.

1187
01:18:05,139 --> 01:18:09,850
Oh, Father, how good of you
to welcome me home from the convent.

1188
01:18:36,170 --> 01:18:39,709
Gloria Fontaine!

1189
01:18:52,353 --> 01:18:54,970
Miss Forsythe?
Miss Forsythe!

1190
01:18:55,064 --> 01:18:57,181
Mr. Crisp, what
are you doing in there?

1191
01:18:57,274 --> 01:19:00,108
We'll be closing up in a little while.
You better be going home.

1192
01:19:00,194 --> 01:19:03,062
I tell you she went in there
20 minutes ago.

1193
01:19:03,155 --> 01:19:04,487
Mrs. Crisp,
are you in there?

1194
01:19:04,573 --> 01:19:05,609
No, wait, it's all right!

1195
01:19:06,659 --> 01:19:08,992
Miss Fontaine,
time to close up.

1196
01:19:09,078 --> 01:19:11,536
Yes, I'm almost ready.

1197
01:19:11,622 --> 01:19:13,864
Would you get me
a carriage, Herman?

1198
01:19:13,958 --> 01:19:15,119
Yes, ma'am.

1199
01:19:23,509 --> 01:19:25,250
Cabbie?
Hey, cabbie!

1200
01:19:25,344 --> 01:19:27,802
Come on.
Quick, hurry up.

1201
01:19:29,515 --> 01:19:30,926
Hurry up!

1202
01:19:32,476 --> 01:19:36,095
Go back to your hotel room,
put on your prettiest peignoir,

1203
01:19:36,188 --> 01:19:39,556
go to sleep, and I'll be there
before dawn, I promise.

1204
01:19:39,650 --> 01:19:40,811
Miss Fontaine?

1205
01:19:43,070 --> 01:19:45,187
I got you your cab ready,
Miss Fontaine.

1206
01:19:45,281 --> 01:19:47,989
Thank you.
Well, good night.

1207
01:19:56,834 --> 01:20:00,202
You couldn't steal the plans
for a bank in Oklahoma, Harry?

1208
01:20:00,296 --> 01:20:02,128
That way even if we didn't
get the money,

1209
01:20:02,214 --> 01:20:03,830
we'd have a chance
to strike oil.

1210
01:20:03,924 --> 01:20:08,009
If we can get out of Concord Prison,
we can get out of anywhere in the world.

1211
01:20:08,095 --> 01:20:10,132
Adam Worth's in town.

1212
01:20:10,222 --> 01:20:12,680
I saw him go into the theater
across the street with his gang.

1213
01:20:12,766 --> 01:20:15,383
Gloria Fontaine's in the play.
She let them in, I know.

1214
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:17,184
She snuck them in
after everyone was gone!

1215
01:20:17,271 --> 01:20:19,388
Wait! Wait. Go slow.
I don't understand.

1216
01:20:19,481 --> 01:20:23,191
Adam Worth went into
the theater with his gang.

1217
01:20:23,277 --> 01:20:26,770
I think Gloria Fontaine let them in.
They're up to something.

1218
01:20:26,864 --> 01:20:28,400
What is he doing
in the theater?

1219
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:29,651
I don't know.

1220
01:20:29,742 --> 01:20:32,200
Since I'm sure he already
has her autograph,

1221
01:20:32,286 --> 01:20:34,198
he must be digging a tunnel.

1222
01:20:34,288 --> 01:20:35,278
Exactly!

1223
01:20:35,372 --> 01:20:36,908
The theater is across the street,
isn't it?

1224
01:20:36,999 --> 01:20:38,786
- Right.
- We're going in from the top.

1225
01:20:38,876 --> 01:20:40,208
He's going in from the bottom.

1226
01:20:51,055 --> 01:20:52,796
How are we gonna get in, Harry?

1227
01:20:54,266 --> 01:20:55,632
Shh, someone's coming.

1228
01:21:07,488 --> 01:21:10,196
It's that Leary guy.
Let's follow him.

1229
01:21:10,282 --> 01:21:12,774
What for? To find out
where he's gonna dump the dirt?

1230
01:21:12,868 --> 01:21:14,279
We know how to do that.

1231
01:21:14,370 --> 01:21:17,238
True. But let's go into the theater.
If he has dirt, there's a tunnel.

1232
01:21:17,331 --> 01:21:18,913
Let's go find it.

1233
01:21:18,999 --> 01:21:21,491
Isn't that exactly
what I said upstairs?

1234
01:21:21,585 --> 01:21:23,372
- Yeah.
- Come on, let's go.

1235
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:53,231
Where are we?

1236
01:21:53,325 --> 01:21:54,361
Watch your head.

1237
01:21:54,451 --> 01:21:58,821
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten.

1238
01:21:58,914 --> 01:22:00,906
We'll go through...

1239
01:22:00,999 --> 01:22:02,865
right here.

1240
01:22:03,877 --> 01:22:06,335
What do you think?
Hour, hour and a half?

1241
01:22:06,755 --> 01:22:08,087
About an hour and a quarter.

1242
01:22:08,173 --> 01:22:10,836
We'll finish tomorrow night
after the show.

1243
01:22:11,885 --> 01:22:13,717
Oh, and, Jack, remember,

1244
01:22:13,804 --> 01:22:16,968
we'll need the putty,
the torch,

1245
01:22:17,057 --> 01:22:21,267
the number four dynamite package,
lots of caps and the bicycle pump.

1246
01:22:21,353 --> 01:22:23,470
A bicycle pump?
What's that for?

1247
01:22:23,564 --> 01:22:26,398
How should I know?
But we got it.

1248
01:22:27,151 --> 01:22:28,392
We got everything.

1249
01:22:28,485 --> 01:22:31,273
Everybody.
Harry and Walter, everyone.

1250
01:22:31,363 --> 01:22:33,730
Come on, let's discuss this
one more time.

1251
01:22:34,825 --> 01:22:36,111
All right?

1252
01:22:37,244 --> 01:22:40,487
We go through the theater,
get into the bank, blow the vault.

1253
01:22:40,581 --> 01:22:43,415
And get out before the curtain falls.
Is that clear?

1254
01:22:44,334 --> 01:22:46,371
Excuse me, please.
Lewis Hopkins, press.

1255
01:22:46,462 --> 01:22:49,170
We're doing a story on Miss Fontaine.
We're cleared.

1256
01:22:49,256 --> 01:22:50,588
Flowers for Miss Fontaine.

1257
01:22:50,674 --> 01:22:52,711
Flowers, but they have—
they need water.

1258
01:22:58,974 --> 01:23:02,183
Where can I find
Miss Fontaine's dressing room?

1259
01:23:02,269 --> 01:23:03,510
Who are you?

1260
01:23:03,604 --> 01:23:05,596
I have a legal paper
to serve on her.

1261
01:23:07,316 --> 01:23:08,773
Why, is she in trouble?

1262
01:23:08,859 --> 01:23:12,478
Her dog bit my client when he let her
out of the carriage last night.

1263
01:23:13,405 --> 01:23:15,271
I don't know.
You come back after the show.

1264
01:23:15,365 --> 01:23:17,072
Did you call
the carriage?

1265
01:23:18,202 --> 01:23:19,192
Y-Yes.

1266
01:23:19,286 --> 01:23:21,152
Ah, that could make you
an accessory.

1267
01:23:21,246 --> 01:23:24,785
An— An access—
You follow me.

1268
01:23:35,886 --> 01:23:38,094
Mister? Mister!

1269
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:39,842
I get a half.
That's our deal.

1270
01:23:39,932 --> 01:23:41,343
That's our deal, yeah.

1271
01:23:41,433 --> 01:23:44,392
You get half. You get a nickel.
Pardon me. Nice seeing you.

1272
01:23:44,937 --> 01:23:47,554
All right, one thin dime.
One dime.

1273
01:23:47,648 --> 01:23:52,768
One thin dime to watch Miss Fontaine's
glorious bosom rise and fall...

1274
01:23:52,861 --> 01:23:55,319
as she sings
"The Glorious Kingdom of Love."

1275
01:23:55,405 --> 01:23:56,486
Ten cents, sir.

1276
01:24:02,829 --> 01:24:05,822
Here she is.
Good, good.

1277
01:24:05,916 --> 01:24:07,452
- Which way?
- I don't know.

1278
01:24:07,543 --> 01:24:08,909
Which way do we go?

1279
01:24:31,316 --> 01:24:34,980
Gloria Fontaine
in Lowell, Massachusetts.

1280
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:37,062
The minute I read the review
in the Boston paper,

1281
01:24:37,155 --> 01:24:39,397
I got on the first train.
I don't like it.

1282
01:24:39,491 --> 01:24:41,733
He's somewhere around.
I can feel it.

1283
01:24:41,827 --> 01:24:43,819
Billy, Billy, Billy.

1284
01:24:44,705 --> 01:24:46,788
Short of tidal wave,

1285
01:24:46,873 --> 01:24:49,411
earthquake or revolution...

1286
01:24:50,919 --> 01:24:55,789
the money that sits inside that vault
is as safe as a babe in its mother's arms.

1287
01:25:00,762 --> 01:25:02,424
Watch your head.

1288
01:25:04,683 --> 01:25:07,426
Okay.

1289
01:25:28,248 --> 01:25:29,955
Watch that one right there.

1290
01:25:31,918 --> 01:25:34,786
Yeah, that's good.
It's big enough.

1291
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:37,372
Well, you wanted a bank,
you got a bank.

1292
01:25:37,466 --> 01:25:39,298
Courtesy of Mr. Adam Worth.

1293
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:42,255
Hold these, Mischa.

1294
01:25:43,180 --> 01:25:46,423
Here, here. Great.
Give me a hand.

1295
01:25:46,516 --> 01:25:48,223
All right, you're doing great.
Okay.

1296
01:25:52,564 --> 01:25:55,227
- Come on, Walter.
- I'm coming, Harry.

1297
01:25:57,986 --> 01:25:59,943
Okay.

1298
01:26:00,030 --> 01:26:01,316
All right?

1299
01:26:01,406 --> 01:26:03,147
Who goes next?

1300
01:26:03,241 --> 01:26:04,857
Me? I'm next.

1301
01:26:04,951 --> 01:26:07,443
- Ready? Got her, Ben?
- Yep.

1302
01:26:20,550 --> 01:26:21,461
Okay.

1303
01:26:21,551 --> 01:26:23,008
Just push up.

1304
01:26:26,223 --> 01:26:27,930
Will you watch it?

1305
01:26:29,184 --> 01:26:31,517
That's tremendous.

1306
01:26:32,396 --> 01:26:34,262
No, no, don't touch it.

1307
01:26:34,356 --> 01:26:37,099
Mischa, Mischa, check it out.

1308
01:26:44,408 --> 01:26:46,946
Harry, get the window pole.

1309
01:26:47,035 --> 01:26:48,992
You're gonna open the safe
with a window pole?

1310
01:26:49,079 --> 01:26:51,287
No, the alarm box. Hurry.

1311
01:26:51,373 --> 01:26:52,614
Okay.

1312
01:26:54,376 --> 01:26:55,958
The alarm box
has four terminals.

1313
01:26:56,044 --> 01:26:57,501
How do you know that?

1314
01:26:57,587 --> 01:26:58,794
I can read.

1315
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:00,872
Harry can read.
Harry reads.

1316
01:27:00,966 --> 01:27:03,674
Open the box, but be careful.
Don't touch the iron.

1317
01:27:11,184 --> 01:27:12,766
Be careful, Harry.

1318
01:27:31,079 --> 01:27:32,069
Good, Harry.

1319
01:27:32,164 --> 01:27:34,201
Thank you.
Wait, watch it.

1320
01:27:34,291 --> 01:27:35,702
Harry?

1321
01:27:35,792 --> 01:27:37,749
Be careful, Harry.

1322
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:46,216
That's good.

1323
01:27:59,065 --> 01:28:01,148
Oh, that scared me.

1324
01:28:12,788 --> 01:28:14,620
I'm good at this
'cause I used to fish.

1325
01:28:16,291 --> 01:28:19,125
Rook to your queen three,
Adam.

1326
01:28:20,170 --> 01:28:22,833
Knight to your queen five.

1327
01:28:35,185 --> 01:28:36,471
- Good.
- Don't touch the iron.

1328
01:28:36,561 --> 01:28:38,769
It's off now, right?
I can touch the iron.

1329
01:28:38,855 --> 01:28:39,891
Yeah. That's right.

1330
01:28:39,981 --> 01:28:42,724
Now all we gotta do
is get through the gate.

1331
01:28:42,818 --> 01:28:45,435
You get the torch and turn
it on when I tell you to.

1332
01:28:58,750 --> 01:29:00,366
Walter, give me the fire.

1333
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:02,167
You be careful.

1334
01:29:02,254 --> 01:29:03,244
All right.
Turn it on.

1335
01:29:05,507 --> 01:29:06,873
Give me that.

1336
01:29:10,220 --> 01:29:11,961
All right,
watch yourself.

1337
01:29:12,055 --> 01:29:15,799
I know a lot about this.
Give me the glasses.

1338
01:29:17,686 --> 01:29:19,803
Slower tempo, Johann.

1339
01:29:21,857 --> 01:29:24,315
How wonderful it is
to be home.

1340
01:29:24,401 --> 01:29:27,018
And as terribly lonely
as it was in the convent,

1341
01:29:27,112 --> 01:29:31,072
I am glad I saved myself
for you, my prince.

1342
01:29:31,157 --> 01:29:34,321
I have done almost as much
for you, my darling.

1343
01:29:34,411 --> 01:29:36,073
Today our lives begin.

1344
01:29:38,540 --> 01:29:40,577
Watch out. Watch out.

1345
01:29:46,590 --> 01:29:48,627
Ahh!
Thank you, thank you.

1346
01:29:48,717 --> 01:29:49,878
Very good, Harry.

1347
01:29:49,968 --> 01:29:52,176
Thank you.
Everyone in.

1348
01:29:54,723 --> 01:29:55,884
Oh.

1349
01:29:58,268 --> 01:29:59,554
Now...

1350
01:30:01,563 --> 01:30:06,274
I am going to, uh,
listen with my ear

1351
01:30:06,359 --> 01:30:08,601
to the, uh, door...

1352
01:30:11,323 --> 01:30:14,907
feeling with my fingertips
and my ear

1353
01:30:15,744 --> 01:30:17,110
the right clicks.

1354
01:30:18,121 --> 01:30:21,705
And now...
we'd better get the dynamite.

1355
01:30:23,627 --> 01:30:26,586
Oh, yes,
Florence, Florence, the detonator.

1356
01:30:31,384 --> 01:30:33,546
- Now—
- Shh, shh, please, shh.

1357
01:30:50,779 --> 01:30:55,194
I think they're singing the finale.
Gloria and Prince what's-his-name.

1358
01:30:55,283 --> 01:30:57,616
- Herbert.
- The show will be over in five minutes.

1359
01:30:57,702 --> 01:31:01,286
- Adam Worth will be here in ten.
- There's no time!

1360
01:31:01,373 --> 01:31:03,581
Back to work.
Here we go.

1361
01:31:03,667 --> 01:31:06,000
- What are you gonna do, Harry?
- Just help me down here.

1362
01:31:39,411 --> 01:31:40,652
Stop!

1363
01:32:02,642 --> 01:32:05,225
Ben!

1364
01:32:05,311 --> 01:32:06,222
Ben.

1365
01:32:07,981 --> 01:32:11,145
What are you... doing here?

1366
01:32:27,167 --> 01:32:28,908
Excuse me.

1367
01:32:37,886 --> 01:32:39,297
Hurry.

1368
01:32:54,861 --> 01:32:57,194
I don't think it worked.

1369
01:33:11,336 --> 01:33:12,952
What? What?

1370
01:33:20,595 --> 01:33:21,881
Get me outta this!

1371
01:33:21,971 --> 01:33:23,678
What the heck
are you doing here?

1372
01:33:23,765 --> 01:33:24,881
Harry, it didn't work.

1373
01:33:24,974 --> 01:33:27,466
- What?
- You have to do it again.

1374
01:33:27,560 --> 01:33:28,846
"The Kingdom of Love."

1375
01:33:28,937 --> 01:33:31,554
We have to get ourselves
into the slave costume.

1376
01:33:31,648 --> 01:33:33,560
The Nubian slave costume.

1377
01:33:53,253 --> 01:33:55,620
- Just—
- Bitch!

1378
01:33:55,713 --> 01:33:58,330
And they'll soon
be here to rescue us.

1379
01:33:58,424 --> 01:34:02,589
Is that not right, Othello,
my personal Nubian...

1380
01:34:03,763 --> 01:34:05,254
You've been sleeping
as stage manager!

1381
01:34:05,348 --> 01:34:08,182
There's a performance going on.
Where's my makeup for the Nubian slave?

1382
01:34:08,268 --> 01:34:12,262
Just a second, master.
We're having a bit of a problem.

1383
01:34:16,442 --> 01:34:17,683
My Nubian slave!

1384
01:34:19,737 --> 01:34:22,855
My... personal Nubian slave.

1385
01:34:22,949 --> 01:34:23,905
Yes?

1386
01:34:23,992 --> 01:34:25,949
You wait here.
I shall return.

1387
01:34:26,035 --> 01:34:30,575
Make sure this impostor
does not abduct fair princess...

1388
01:34:47,307 --> 01:34:48,468
Got it?

1389
01:34:58,985 --> 01:35:01,944
Rook to your king five.

1390
01:35:04,824 --> 01:35:06,235
Check and mate.

1391
01:35:07,535 --> 01:35:09,652
Well, gentlemen,
shall we go to work?

1392
01:35:13,124 --> 01:35:15,832
Ho, ho, ho?
That's in here?

1393
01:35:24,636 --> 01:35:27,379
Somehow we've gotta get
the dynamite behind the door.

1394
01:35:27,472 --> 01:35:30,135
Behind the door,
behind the door.

1395
01:35:30,225 --> 01:35:31,841
Behind— That's it!

1396
01:35:31,935 --> 01:35:33,051
That's it.
What, what?

1397
01:35:33,144 --> 01:35:36,012
Behind the door.
Now we know how to do it.

1398
01:35:36,105 --> 01:35:37,721
That Adam Worth is a genius.

1399
01:35:37,815 --> 01:35:39,306
- How simple, how beautiful.
- What is it?

1400
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:42,689
The bicycle pump, darling girl.
The bicycle pump.

1401
01:35:42,779 --> 01:35:46,443
Ben, get the enamel pan
and the putty from the tunnel.

1402
01:35:46,532 --> 01:35:49,616
Lewis, unwrap the dynamite
and cook it with the torch.

1403
01:35:49,702 --> 01:35:52,866
Fill up all the cracks
with, uh, putty.

1404
01:35:52,956 --> 01:35:56,074
Make a cup at the top
with a little hole on the bottom.

1405
01:35:56,167 --> 01:35:58,625
Behind the door!
I knew it!

1406
01:36:02,715 --> 01:36:04,331
At last he's gone.

1407
01:36:12,141 --> 01:36:13,427
Be careful.

1408
01:36:13,518 --> 01:36:15,510
Be careful
whatever you do.

1409
01:36:15,603 --> 01:36:17,094
That's the last of it,
Mischa.

1410
01:36:17,188 --> 01:36:18,554
Lewis, be careful.

1411
01:36:18,648 --> 01:36:21,231
Strain it...
with a handkerchief.

1412
01:36:21,317 --> 01:36:23,354
And pour it into the pitcher.
Hurry.

1413
01:36:23,444 --> 01:36:28,280
I am the real prince!
Darling!

1414
01:36:31,744 --> 01:36:32,780
Christ!

1415
01:36:32,870 --> 01:36:33,860
No, no, no, no!

1416
01:36:33,955 --> 01:36:36,038
I shall tell you the story
of the young child

1417
01:36:36,124 --> 01:36:38,707
who was taken from his parents'
carriage by the gypsies.

1418
01:36:38,793 --> 01:36:43,333
And brought to the forest
where he was brought up by owls who...

1419
01:36:43,423 --> 01:36:44,539
Owls whoooo.

1420
01:36:44,632 --> 01:36:47,500
And wolves and sheep.

1421
01:36:47,593 --> 01:36:49,960
By alley cats—
and I have the arrangement.

1422
01:36:50,054 --> 01:36:52,262
The arrangement?
What kind of arrangement?

1423
01:36:52,348 --> 01:36:55,512
The arrangement is right here,
and it will unravel this tale.

1424
01:36:55,601 --> 01:36:57,638
Play that for me,
piano player.

1425
01:36:57,729 --> 01:36:59,766
And we'll straighten out
the court.

1426
01:37:12,076 --> 01:37:13,066
Gently.

1427
01:37:15,830 --> 01:37:17,071
We have to hurry.

1428
01:37:25,548 --> 01:37:26,959
The ballet music.

1429
01:37:27,050 --> 01:37:29,258
Number 12, number 12.

1430
01:37:44,984 --> 01:37:47,067
It must be running late.
The damn play's still on.

1431
01:37:47,153 --> 01:37:49,941
All we need
is five more minutes.

1432
01:37:50,031 --> 01:37:51,192
I'm on my way.

1433
01:37:59,123 --> 01:38:02,537
Red, get in the front door,
see what's happening.

1434
01:38:03,836 --> 01:38:06,294
That Adam Worth is a genius.

1435
01:38:06,381 --> 01:38:10,671
You see, by reversing the tube,
you create a vacuum.

1436
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:14,470
Instead of blowing,
it draws the liquid.

1437
01:38:14,555 --> 01:38:17,844
With luck, it'll come down.
Oh, that Adam Worth is a genius.

1438
01:38:17,934 --> 01:38:20,597
Keep pouring, keep pouring.
No, no!

1439
01:38:20,686 --> 01:38:23,099
That's it! That's it!
Look at this. We got it.

1440
01:38:23,189 --> 01:38:24,521
That's it.

1441
01:38:51,968 --> 01:38:52,924
Hey, Nubian slave!

1442
01:38:54,554 --> 01:38:57,547
I have news I care to share
with you, ol' slave.

1443
01:38:57,640 --> 01:39:00,974
My armies, in a few minutes,
will be victorious.

1444
01:39:01,060 --> 01:39:05,555
Your armies? You mean my armies!
For I am the real Prince Herbert.

1445
01:39:06,607 --> 01:39:08,143
That's the first
I heard that.

1446
01:39:08,234 --> 01:39:09,725
You weren't here
when I explained.

1447
01:39:09,819 --> 01:39:11,811
Everybody heard when I explained.
You're a duke.

1448
01:39:11,904 --> 01:39:13,691
- I'm a duke?
- A duke, a duke!

1449
01:39:47,565 --> 01:39:49,682
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.

1450
01:40:04,332 --> 01:40:05,539
My God, it's Leary.

1451
01:40:13,132 --> 01:40:14,373
Try it again.
Try it again.

1452
01:40:27,730 --> 01:40:29,312
We did it.
Come on!

1453
01:40:46,541 --> 01:40:47,531
Go, go, go!

1454
01:41:05,059 --> 01:41:07,676
Okay, Florence,
you go down now.

1455
01:41:07,770 --> 01:41:10,308
Damn it! It's got
to be one of these!

1456
01:41:55,610 --> 01:41:56,942
All right, boys.

1457
01:42:34,190 --> 01:42:37,774
Adam Worth, you and your associates
are under arrest

1458
01:42:37,860 --> 01:42:40,147
for the robbery of the Commercial Bank
and Trust Company.

1459
01:42:40,237 --> 01:42:42,604
I know this seems unusual,

1460
01:42:42,698 --> 01:42:46,567
but as you can plainly see,
I'm on my way in, not out.

1461
01:43:19,819 --> 01:43:21,981
- Bravo!
- More! More!

1462
01:43:35,084 --> 01:43:36,950
Giddap.

1463
01:43:41,966 --> 01:43:43,127
Thank you.

1464
01:43:45,386 --> 01:43:46,593
Here you are.

1465
01:43:47,471 --> 01:43:48,882
Thank you.

1466
01:43:49,515 --> 01:43:52,349
Here you are, my good man.
Here you are.

1467
01:44:29,096 --> 01:44:30,553
We should like

1468
01:44:30,639 --> 01:44:32,346
the best table
in the joint.

1469
01:44:33,184 --> 01:44:35,050
Would you excuse me
one moment, please.

1470
01:44:35,144 --> 01:44:36,885
Sure, make it quick.

1471
01:44:38,022 --> 01:44:39,729
Watch yourself.
Watch yourself.

1472
01:44:59,585 --> 01:45:00,621
Harry.

1473
01:45:00,711 --> 01:45:01,918
It's all right.

1474
01:45:03,130 --> 01:45:04,496
- I've got my cane.
- All right.

1475
01:45:06,634 --> 01:45:08,751
You're gonna leave quietly,
aren't you, Harry?

1476
01:45:09,595 --> 01:45:12,178
Well, uh-uh.

1477
01:45:43,546 --> 01:45:45,833
Thank you, thank you.

1478
01:45:47,132 --> 01:45:49,340
Thank you, thank you.

1479
01:46:00,271 --> 01:46:02,638
Thank you.
My partner.

1480
01:46:09,363 --> 01:46:10,604
Thank you.

1481
01:46:10,698 --> 01:46:12,781
Dighby, planned
your next job yet?

1482
01:46:12,867 --> 01:46:16,110
No, no, no. We're—
We're going to take a little time off.

1483
01:46:16,203 --> 01:46:19,492
We haven't worked out that yet.
Oh, the wine— '79.

1484
01:46:19,582 --> 01:46:24,577
Mr. Hill, where did you learn
to sing and dance like that?

1485
01:46:26,589 --> 01:46:27,796
Miss Chestnut...

1486
01:46:29,300 --> 01:46:31,587
may I have a word in private
with you, please?

1487
01:46:51,989 --> 01:46:55,608
You are an extraordinary
woman, Miss Chestnut.

1488
01:46:57,286 --> 01:46:58,652
Tell me...

1489
01:46:59,830 --> 01:47:04,450
is it your intention to continue
in your life of high adventure?

1490
01:47:04,543 --> 01:47:08,457
Mr. Worth, our share of the money
has been used to start what I hope...

1491
01:47:08,547 --> 01:47:11,881
will one day be the largest permanent
milk fund in this city.

1492
01:47:11,967 --> 01:47:15,335
If you care to make a donation,
I think you know our address.

1493
01:47:15,429 --> 01:47:18,046
Calmly, Miss Chestnut.

1494
01:47:18,140 --> 01:47:19,802
You've already won the war.

1495
01:47:21,477 --> 01:47:25,517
Shall we discuss
the terms of the treaty?

1496
01:47:29,860 --> 01:47:31,476
Shall I tell you
about the party?

1497
01:47:31,570 --> 01:47:32,856
She mentioned it.

1498
01:47:32,947 --> 01:47:35,781
She is a decadent woman,
don't you think?

1499
01:47:35,866 --> 01:47:36,822
Yeah.

1500
01:47:38,869 --> 01:47:42,237
Finger bowl, sir.
Refresh yourself.

1501
01:47:45,584 --> 01:47:46,950
Refresh yourself.

1502
01:47:48,170 --> 01:47:51,163
My, my, my.
You're a very healthy girl.

1503
01:47:51,256 --> 01:47:53,589
Walter.
Excuse me.

1504
01:47:54,385 --> 01:47:55,671
Refresh yourself.

1505
01:47:56,387 --> 01:47:57,594
To us.

1506
01:47:58,347 --> 01:47:59,633
Partner, to us.

1507
01:48:03,727 --> 01:48:05,434
Lissa.

1508
01:48:06,522 --> 01:48:07,512
Where are you going?

1509
01:48:07,606 --> 01:48:10,269
Walter, don't worry.
I'll be all right.

1510
01:48:32,423 --> 01:48:34,130
Nothing matters anymore.

1511
01:48:35,467 --> 01:48:38,585
Stop it. Look, I like her too.
I'm not cryin'.

1512
01:48:38,679 --> 01:48:39,760
Look where we are.

1513
01:48:39,847 --> 01:48:42,715
This is probably the fanciest
room in the whole world.

1514
01:48:42,808 --> 01:48:44,470
My life is over, Harry.

1515
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:47,303
I always promised you we'd play
a room like this someday.

1516
01:48:47,396 --> 01:48:49,058
Look, we own this joint.
We can do it.

1517
01:48:49,148 --> 01:48:50,764
- Where's the music?
- What music?

1518
01:48:50,858 --> 01:48:52,815
Don't give me that.
You always carry the music.

1519
01:48:52,901 --> 01:48:54,563
I don't want to pull
the music out.

1520
01:48:54,653 --> 01:48:56,645
- Aha!
- I don't wanna take the music out.

1521
01:48:56,739 --> 01:48:57,695
Trust me, trust me.

1522
01:48:57,781 --> 01:48:59,818
- Harry, Harry—
- Trust me.

1523
01:48:59,908 --> 01:49:01,194
Excuse me.

1524
01:49:01,285 --> 01:49:02,992
Excuse me,
will you stop please?

1525
01:49:03,078 --> 01:49:04,694
Hey, they stopped. Great.

1526
01:49:04,788 --> 01:49:06,495
Can you play this?

1527
01:49:06,582 --> 01:49:08,118
This is an elegant place.

1528
01:49:08,208 --> 01:49:09,949
It's very complicated and...

1529
01:49:11,170 --> 01:49:13,412
We can't do that here.
We don't have our makeup...

1530
01:49:13,505 --> 01:49:16,623
- We can play it, sir.
- You can play that?

1531
01:49:16,717 --> 01:49:19,460
Well, pick it up a little.
A little more tempo.

1532
01:49:19,553 --> 01:49:20,885
I don't know whether we...
