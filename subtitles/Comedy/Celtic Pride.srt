1
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:35,661
Listen up! Kevin, you're
playing the number five position!

2
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:40,874
It means you set the back pick
on the box on the weak side for Tom!

3
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:45,420
Cary, you're gonna catch the ball
at the foul line and then pivot.

4
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:47,631
Pivot into the triple threat position,

5
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,968
bounce pass to Tom
at the top of the key.

6
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:53,470
Then you backdoor, OK?

7
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:58,475
You go backdoor towards the basket
for the lay-up.

8
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:02,688
Are there any questions? What?

9
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:06,441
Can we go on the trampoline,
Mr O'Hara?

10
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:11,572
Yeah. No flips on the trampoline.

11
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,824
Thank your friend
Billy Williams for that.

12
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:19,371
He sued the school after hurting
his neck, ruining it for everyone.

13
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:23,876
- What?
- Are you all right, Mr O'Hara?

14
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:28,046
- You look worried.
- Well, Josh, I am a little worried.

15
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:32,384
My Celtics are playing a very
important basketball game tonight.

16
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:34,011
I want them to win.

17
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:37,806
But you say the most important thing
is they try their hardest

18
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:40,434
and have fun.

19
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,938
No...no.

20
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:49,151
The most important thing is
that they win.

21
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:53,280
I mean,
we're not talking about kickball

22
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:56,575
where there's nothing at stake.
We're talking about

23
00:01:56,783 --> 00:02:01,997
the National Basketball
Association. They have to win.

24
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:06,793
You understand? They're tearing down
the Boston Garden

25
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:12,341
at the end of this season,
so this is their last chance at glory.

26
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:18,222
They will not lose because I won't
let them lose! You understand?

27
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,852
Don't cry.

28
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:29,107
Don't cry. I was just being silly.

29
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:33,487
Why don't you go jump
on the trampoline? You'll feel better.

30
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:36,406
You don't even have
to stand in line. Hey!

31
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:39,368
Josh doesn't have to
stand in line, everybody!

32
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:43,372
That's not fair!

33
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:48,293
- Hey, Mike.
- Hey, Carol. What's up?

34
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:51,296
Got a minute?

35
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:54,550
I'm sorry I've been acting
like such a jerk.

36
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:57,469
We are in the middle
of the NBA finals.

37
00:02:57,678 --> 00:03:00,848
- You know I can get a little crazy.
- I know.

38
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:04,017
But I've been hearing that
for 1 5 years.

39
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:07,437
In the 80s, when the Celtics
won the championship,

40
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,314
you were a joy to be with.

41
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:12,693
I can't stand seeing you
in a good mood when they win

42
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:15,988
and a bad mood when they lose.

43
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:19,950
- I won't let Celtics run my life.
- How d'you think I feel?

44
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:25,998
Mike. These are divorce papers.

45
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:30,294
I have them
from the last time we split up.

46
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:32,379
- You saved them?
- Yes!

47
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:38,051
And the only reason I haven't signed
them is because I feel bad for you.

48
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:43,015
I spoke with my therapist.
I know that part of this obsession

49
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,143
comes from you never
having made it as a player.

50
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:49,855
Your dream died,
so you live it through the Celtics.

51
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:54,109
It's time to move on,
it's time to get a new dream.

52
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:56,403
My dream is dead.

53
00:03:56,612 --> 00:04:01,700
Squashed like a squirrel on the
highway. Thank you for the update.

54
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:07,497
Screw you. I was trying to be nice.
But you are hopeless.

55
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:11,877
I know I'm hopeless.
'Cause my dream is dead!

56
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,796
Hey, kids, listen up!

57
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:18,425
My dream is dead! OK?

58
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:21,053
- You are sick.
- I know I'm sick.

59
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,556
I am sick and tired of you
and your therapist

60
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:28,810
taking something pure
and twisting it around!

61
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:31,104
I love the Celtics!

62
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:36,318
OK, I said it! I am not ashamed of it!

63
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:40,614
I love the Celtics!

64
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:47,913
Bounce!

65
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:08,267
I am not a hero.

66
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:13,397
A hero fights against injustice.

67
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:17,568
A hero sacrifices for the good of man.

68
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:22,531
He unites, uplifts and inspires.

69
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:28,161
I am not a hero. It's my house.

70
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:51,685
I don't wanna raise your kids.
I don't even like kids.

71
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56,773
Yeah, yeah.
That's really nice of you, douche bag.

72
00:05:56,982 --> 00:06:01,320
My Celts are going to give you the
beating of your life tomorrow night.

73
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:07,826
OK, Bruins. Just one in the net!
That's all I'm asking.

74
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:11,330
Neely, come on, man! No!

75
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,999
No, no, no, no.

76
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:18,629
Everybody, just stay calm.
Let them do what they do.

77
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:23,050
Let the other goalie...
That net was wide open!

78
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:24,927
Excuse me.

79
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,222
What are you doing?

80
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:31,266
Just taking a little breakski.
Watching the game here.

81
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:36,897
- So my toilet still isn't fixed?
- Oh, you gotta go?

82
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:40,484
Can you hold it five more minutes?
Neely's gonna pull it out.

83
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:45,405
- Fix my toilet.
- OK.

84
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:48,325
Plunger.

85
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:53,997
Grandma?
Are you watching the Bruins game?

86
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:55,916
<i>Yes, Peanut.</i>

87
00:06:56,124 --> 00:07:02,714
- Can you put the phone by the TV?
- "No problem. Hold on a second."

88
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:13,058
- Dad, what happened?
- Tommy.

89
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:18,188
There was a time in this country
when sports were revered.

90
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:22,776
But people today...
Their values are all out of whack.

91
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:27,990
Your mom and I are getting divorced.
See you, Tommy.

92
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,284
Bye, Dad.

93
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:37,207
See you, Dad!

94
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,313
- Hi, darling.
- Hi.

95
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:03,358
Tomorrow's gonna
be the greatest day of my life.

96
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:07,487
We'll be celebrating the first
Celtics' championship of the 90s.

97
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:10,782
- Excited?
- Yeah.

98
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:15,579
You only finished one order of ribs.
What's going on with you, anyway?

99
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:18,916
- Carol and I split up again.
- Really?

100
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:21,668
Yes. What are you smiling about?

101
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:25,047
Last time you broke up,
the Celtics won the championship.

102
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:27,966
That thought crossed my mind.

103
00:08:28,217 --> 00:08:31,470
- Good evening, sir. Ma'am.
- Kevin.

104
00:08:31,762 --> 00:08:36,725
Shouldn't you be planting evidence
on somebody this time of night?

105
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:41,271
I already did that. Celtics are gonna
blow out Utah tomorrow.

106
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:46,443
I hope so. Scott's taking 50 shots
a game. If he's hot, we're in trouble.

107
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:52,157
"If he's hot... " Three weeks
of college ball and he's an expert.

108
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:58,121
He led Boston in rebounds and assists
in his senior year of high school.

109
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:00,249
You were brutally defeated

110
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:04,503
in the 1 9 73 State Wrestling
Tournament by a blind guy.

111
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:08,382
Not brutally. I held back.
I didn't want to hurt the poor kid.

112
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:12,678
- He pinned you in 8.2 seconds.
- Where do you store all this memory?

113
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:17,808
I mean, how do you..?
It was more like 1 2 seconds, anyway.

114
00:09:18,851 --> 00:09:21,770
Mark! Turn on the tube. Help me out.

115
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:28,777
<i>On Tuesday night, the Celtics
defeated Utah Jazz with 1 06-94.</i>

116
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:34,283
<i>Worse, Scott was fined $ 1 0,000
for missing yesterday's practice.</i>

117
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:37,077
10,000, what's that to him?

118
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:40,414
<i>He had this to say
about Tuesday's game.</i>

119
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:43,292
<i>I'm sorry, OK?</i>

120
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:48,130
<i>I've had back problems from carrying
this sorry excuse for a team.</i>

121
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:52,843
- Talk about your textbook A-hole.
- Blaming the team, right?

122
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:58,348
<i>Lewis Scott has gone A WOL. Suddenly,
Dennis Rodman doesn't seem so bad.</i>

123
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:01,977
Here we go, Celtics, here we go!

124
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:05,939
Here we go, Celtics, here we go!

125
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:09,985
Hey, Ed, here we go!

126
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:14,990
Cindy!

127
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,263
Here we go!

128
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:40,933
Here we go! Here we go!

129
00:10:41,934 --> 00:10:44,978
- How are you doing?
- Spent the whole morning on the bowl.

130
00:10:45,187 --> 00:10:48,106
Always a good sign.

131
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:55,280
Just the way you like it, Jimmy.
I've even toasted the bun.

132
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:59,409
- How? There's no toaster here.
- I used my curling iron.

133
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:03,413
- Thanks, Suzy.
- It's on the house, Jimmy.

134
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:08,585
- Oh, Suzy the hot-dog girl!
- Don't start!

135
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:10,754
Hey, beer!

136
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:16,969
- Shall we begin?
- Indeed, sir.

137
00:11:18,804 --> 00:11:22,307
Go home, Jazz! It's over!

138
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:27,271
-Jazz music sucks and so do you!
- You suck.

139
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:32,818
Why don't you go back to Utah
and get yourself a few more wives!

140
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:39,116
If Lewis Scott ever let you take
a shot, you'd wet your frigging pants!

141
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:42,119
Why don't you join the Mormon Choir,

142
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:44,246
Donny and Marie-loving freaks!

143
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:49,501
- You're in Bean Town now, baby.
- Bean Town!

144
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:53,130
- Bean Town!
- I hate fans.

145
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:57,718
Hey, Scott! I hear Manute Bol
was banging your mom!

146
00:11:57,968 --> 00:12:02,472
- Manute Bol! Your mom!
- Oh, that's witty, whitey.

147
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:07,644
You guys suck so bad that
Nike should take your shoes away!

148
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:12,316
- How'd I do?
- Good one with the shoes.

149
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:15,360
I thought of that one last night.

150
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:20,365
- This is an even game, isn't it?
- It's an even game! God!

151
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:24,786
Oh, that was close.

152
00:12:25,621 --> 00:12:28,457
All right. Here we go!

153
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:35,464
<i>Good evening. I'm Marv Albert along
with Bill Walton at Boston Garden</i>

154
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:38,842
getting ready for game six
of the NBA world championship

155
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:42,888
and what could be the final game
here at the Boston Garden,

156
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:46,058
<i>before it's going down.</i>

157
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,977
All right, gentlemen, this is it.

158
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:52,022
Let's play the game
that got us here, all right?

159
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:58,028
Pass the ball around, keep it moving.
Grab some big, fat defence.

160
00:12:58,237 --> 00:13:00,906
- That's all we need to do.
- One other thing.

161
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:07,412
- Keep feeding me the rock.
- Thanks for the pep talk, asshole.

162
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:12,292
Come on, let's do it.
One, two, three, Jazz.

163
00:13:14,086 --> 00:13:16,630
Hey, Coach Kimball!

164
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,218
You'd better do what Lewis Scott says,
'cause he owns your ass!

165
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:24,596
- Why don't you shut up!
- Why don't you learn to coach!

166
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,100
Come on, buddy.
Come and get me!

167
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,687
He's not worth it!

168
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:35,816
Go!

169
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:37,401
OK, here we go.

170
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:43,657
Good luck, guys.

171
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:52,666
All right, work it down now.

172
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:57,629
Go!

173
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:02,759
Hustle back on "D"!

174
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:09,516
Heads up, right side!

175
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:13,020
Defence! Defence!

176
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:16,356
Charge!

177
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:19,902
Beautiful, Celts!

178
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:32,623
Let's go!

179
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:46,970
Watch it, ref!

180
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:51,141
- Yeah, Kirby!
- Back on "D"!

181
00:14:52,226 --> 00:14:53,769
- Sorry, chief.
- Hey, ref!

182
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:57,773
- That was a foul.
- No way.

183
00:14:57,981 --> 00:15:02,819
- Good call. No blood, no foul.
- Quit whining and take your Midol!

184
00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:05,989
Spread out! Number 3!

185
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:10,536
Yeah!

186
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:14,373
- Why don't you try passing the ball?
- Worry about your own game.

187
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:17,084
Lewis, I think he's right.

188
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:27,302
What a dick!

189
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:36,895
Celts, Celts, Celts, Celts!

190
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:39,773
I love the Celtics!

191
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:47,239
What do you want, punk?

192
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:57,332
Utah sucks, Utah sucks,
Utah sucks, Utah sucks!

193
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:08,093
- A new Celtics dynasty is beginning.
- They're gonna do it.

194
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:12,222
It's going to feel so good to deny
Lewis Scott the championship.

195
00:16:12,431 --> 00:16:14,141
He'll never win it.

196
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:16,685
Chris McCarthy! Where have you been?

197
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:18,937
I got married. I'm up in New York.

198
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:22,524
Haven't seen you since '86,
when Buckner had that mishap.

199
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:24,443
Hey, not my fault.

200
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:27,112
- What are you doing?
- I came for the game.

201
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:31,950
- I got a ticket. 300 from a scalper.
- You're hard core.

202
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:34,036
Hey, good to see you.

203
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:38,499
- You guys want to go to Doyle's?
- See you there.

204
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:41,335
Chris McCarthy!

205
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:47,758
- You still on that Buckner thing?
- Yeah. Chris McCarthy!

206
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:51,303
- Hey, fellas.
- Hey!

207
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:56,183
One, two, Jazz!

208
00:16:57,643 --> 00:17:01,104
Here we go!
24 minutes from heaven!

209
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:09,029
- There it is.
- You can't stop me!

210
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,244
Come on!

211
00:17:22,793 --> 00:17:27,881
Good thing they're tearing this place
down, 'cause I'm wrecking your house.

212
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:32,094
No!

213
00:17:44,982 --> 00:17:49,152
- I'm on fire!
- Time-out, ref.

214
00:17:49,361 --> 00:17:51,780
What just happened?

215
00:17:51,989 --> 00:17:55,659
They were on fire.
Then something changed.

216
00:17:55,868 --> 00:18:00,038
Yeah. What changed since first half?

217
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,630
Hey, guys.

218
00:18:09,715 --> 00:18:12,676
- I think you should go, Chris.
- What are you talking about?

219
00:18:14,136 --> 00:18:17,848
Celtics were up by 1 8,
and now they're only up by 2!

220
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:20,642
- So what?
- You're the bad luck guy.

221
00:18:20,851 --> 00:18:24,897
- You're not gonna lay this one on me.
- Seriously. See you tomorrow.

222
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:29,151
- I mean it! Get out of here, now!
- Not going.

223
00:18:30,027 --> 00:18:31,904
Give it.

224
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:38,160
- Are you happy now?
- Hit the road!

225
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:43,499
I paid 300 bucks for this ticket.
That's a frigging car payment!

226
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:46,335
- The nerve of that guy.
- You're telling me.

227
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:50,964
- It's over. He's gone now.
- The virus has been destroyed.

228
00:18:54,551 --> 00:18:57,095
Bing! Gotcha!

229
00:18:57,304 --> 00:19:02,100
Maybe your lucky seat is my
lucky seat for the second half.

230
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:06,104
So by sitting in this seat
I'm helping the Jazz? Switch!

231
00:19:14,238 --> 00:19:16,657
Maybe you two should switch.

232
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:27,918
- The Celts are getting killed, Mikey.
- They've got to work it to the post.

233
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:33,507
Kiss my ass, Boston!

234
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:36,343
Switch, switch!

235
00:19:36,552 --> 00:19:38,846
Switch, switch!

236
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:47,145
Everybody, this is not working.
It was a bad idea!

237
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:50,148
Back to your seats! Now!

238
00:19:52,943 --> 00:19:55,404
Defence!

239
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:57,364
Get Scott!

240
00:20:00,284 --> 00:20:02,452
No!

241
00:20:09,168 --> 00:20:13,714
They didn't use enough time.
Why didn't they listen to me?

242
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:17,718
How hard can it be?

243
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:23,599
- Lewis! I'm going to Disneyland!
- Good.

244
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:41,909
I can't believe
it's going seven games.

245
00:20:43,118 --> 00:20:50,792
Well, it could be worse.
It's not like we're boat people

246
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:57,049
out in the Bermuda Triangle
in a leaky raft dying of thirst.

247
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:03,847
I wish I was a boat person!
Their team didn't lose.

248
00:21:04,056 --> 00:21:08,602
- They're happy! They're on a boat.
- In the sun.

249
00:21:16,568 --> 00:21:20,447
Maybe I shouldn't.
I'm starting to see double.

250
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:34,962
- Flaherty Plumbing.
- It's Patty and Timmy.

251
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,548
You won't believe who's in here.
Lewis Scott!

252
00:21:37,923 --> 00:21:43,387
- What? You're pulling my chain.
- He just left us a $ 1 00 tip.

253
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:48,433
- "And he's dancing. What an asshole!"
- Thanks.

254
00:21:48,642 --> 00:21:53,689
Timmy and Patty are bar keeping
at the Roxy. Guess who just walked in?

255
00:21:53,897 --> 00:21:56,400
- Who?
- Lewis Scott.

256
00:21:56,692 --> 00:22:01,446
They said he's dancing.
He's dancing!

257
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:05,075
I mean, he's throwing it in our face!

258
00:22:05,284 --> 00:22:09,204
- The nerve of that guy.
- You're telling me.

259
00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:14,376
I'm wearing Jack Nicklaus's jacket!

260
00:22:14,585 --> 00:22:19,423
He got it for winning his first Masters,
so don't get cranberry on it.

261
00:22:19,631 --> 00:22:24,303
- Are you sure he's here?
- Timmy and Patty swear he is.

262
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:31,602
There he is.

263
00:22:32,728 --> 00:22:36,315
- What a dick.
- Come on.

264
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:45,032
This is stupid.
What are we doing here?

265
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:50,829
I just want to look him in the eye.
Cover me. I'm going in.

266
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:55,167
Cover you?
You're covered. Oh, boy.

267
00:22:55,918 --> 00:23:04,551
<i>They were singin'and movin'
to the groovin'</i>

268
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:11,892
<i>Play that funky music, white boy
Play that funky music right</i>

269
00:23:17,773 --> 00:23:20,984
- So?
- I looked into the face of the Devil.

270
00:23:21,193 --> 00:23:25,447
- And I feel stronger for it.
- Good. I'm proud of you.

271
00:23:25,614 --> 00:23:30,577
I can't believe this guy is trying to
take my championship away from me!

272
00:23:30,786 --> 00:23:35,040
Money for nothing
and chicks for free, right?

273
00:23:35,249 --> 00:23:39,545
- Something's got to be done.
- There's nothing to do.

274
00:23:39,753 --> 00:23:45,634
What if we got him completely wrecked
so he was too hung over to play well.

275
00:23:45,843 --> 00:23:48,804
- We could do that.
- Nobody could do it better.

276
00:23:49,054 --> 00:23:52,266
He'd be wasted for a week!

277
00:23:52,474 --> 00:23:54,518
So let's do it.

278
00:23:55,727 --> 00:24:00,899
Are you serious? You really want
to do it? Because I will do it.

279
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:07,239
Let's mess him up.

280
00:24:09,491 --> 00:24:13,287
- Tell him we're his biggest fans.
- Hey, Lewis Scott!

281
00:24:13,495 --> 00:24:17,166
- I'm your biggest fan! How are you?
- Don't I know you?

282
00:24:17,374 --> 00:24:22,963
- I saw the game. You were great.
- Yeah, I guess I was.

283
00:24:23,172 --> 00:24:27,801
- You're the dude on the dance floor.
- Scott, you son of a bitch.

284
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:32,306
The Celtics are going
to hand you your ass on Sunday.

285
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:35,684
Your whole team hates you,
and so do I.

286
00:24:35,893 --> 00:24:38,937
Really? Well, look at this here.

287
00:24:39,146 --> 00:24:41,523
She loves me. So does my banker.

288
00:24:41,732 --> 00:24:44,359
Go vomit so you can feel better
about yourself.

289
00:24:44,568 --> 00:24:48,071
You're just a selfish ball hog, and...

290
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:54,369
Hey, moron! The reason why he's
a selfish ball hog is because...

291
00:24:56,371 --> 00:25:00,834
..he's the greatest player in the NBA.

292
00:25:01,043 --> 00:25:06,632
I'm gonna beat your ass just like
Utah's going to beat the Celtics.

293
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,384
- Where are you from?
- Charlestown. Get out of here.

294
00:25:09,593 --> 00:25:12,554
Traitor! Back-stabber!

295
00:25:12,763 --> 00:25:15,557
- I'm going to throw up.
- I appreciate that, man.

296
00:25:15,766 --> 00:25:19,102
It takes courage
to speak the truth in this town.

297
00:25:19,311 --> 00:25:23,315
He wouldn't have said it if he
didn't mean it. You're the greatest.

298
00:25:23,524 --> 00:25:28,278
- You guys are well-educated fans.
- We want to buy you a drink!

299
00:25:28,487 --> 00:25:33,242
No, no, no, Lewis Scott is
going to buy you two a drink.

300
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:36,703
Another beer,
and my new friends here will have...

301
00:25:36,912 --> 00:25:38,247
A scotch soda!

302
00:25:38,455 --> 00:25:42,626
Schnapps and a scotch.
Make mine a vodka.

303
00:25:44,461 --> 00:25:47,256
- This is a great party.
- It's great here!

304
00:25:47,464 --> 00:25:50,467
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

305
00:25:50,676 --> 00:25:54,054
- Good game tonight, Lewis.
- What's up, old timer?

306
00:25:54,263 --> 00:25:57,391
Wish you was out there.
I'd take you to school.

307
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:00,894
You must love living
in that fantasy world.

308
00:26:01,103 --> 00:26:04,690
- What are you up to?
- Having dinner with friends.

309
00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:09,319
- Really? This is...
- I'm Larry Bird. How are you?

310
00:26:09,528 --> 00:26:12,573
- I mean Mike O'Hara.
- And...

311
00:26:12,781 --> 00:26:17,494
-Jimmy Flaherty.
- They're an endangered species here.

312
00:26:17,703 --> 00:26:21,999
Two white Irish guys who hate
the Celtics, ain't that right, guys?

313
00:26:22,207 --> 00:26:25,169
- Er...
- No...

314
00:26:25,377 --> 00:26:31,383
We loved the Celtics, when you played
for them. You were the master.

315
00:26:31,592 --> 00:26:35,929
But I guess for the Celtics, the
leprechauns have left the building.

316
00:26:36,138 --> 00:26:37,931
Fans like you make me sick.

317
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:41,602
You love us when we win
and hate us when we lose.

318
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:44,813
It's pathetic. You should learn
something about loyalty.

319
00:26:45,022 --> 00:26:48,442
Fans like these, you can have 'em.

320
00:26:49,651 --> 00:26:52,487
Who needs his lanky ass anyway?

321
00:26:55,657 --> 00:27:00,871
- He was overrated as a player.
- Yeah, he wasn't really that great.

322
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:04,166
- Yeah, he sucked.
- Sucked.

323
00:27:04,374 --> 00:27:07,711
- Where are our drinks?
- Right away.

324
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:11,298
We were at the game
when Seton Hall beat Boston College.

325
00:27:11,507 --> 00:27:13,467
- Get out of here.
- We were there.

326
00:27:13,675 --> 00:27:19,014
You pulled a triple-double, 42 points,
20 rebounds, 1 1 assists. What a game!

327
00:27:19,223 --> 00:27:22,017
- It was a bad day for me.
- Kicked our ass.

328
00:27:22,226 --> 00:27:27,064
- That's Lewis Scott, the ass-kicker.
- I've still got the ticket.

329
00:27:31,693 --> 00:27:34,988
Here's to you. Oh, boy.

330
00:27:35,197 --> 00:27:38,075
There you go!

331
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:43,872
Keep 'em coming!

332
00:27:47,793 --> 00:27:51,839
- Get it down!
- Right down there!

333
00:28:04,268 --> 00:28:07,604
Let's play "invent-a-drink".

334
00:28:07,813 --> 00:28:11,692
The first drink
I'm going to make is called...

335
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,820
Lewis Scott!

336
00:28:15,028 --> 00:28:19,992
-Jimmy's got one.
- This one is called "Jimmy's dick".

337
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:24,580
It's short...fat...

338
00:28:24,788 --> 00:28:28,458
But it fills the gap.

339
00:28:28,667 --> 00:28:33,714
This one is called
"The Boston Celtics".

340
00:28:33,922 --> 00:28:37,843
- It's weak, 'cause it's white.
- That's funny.

341
00:28:38,051 --> 00:28:43,056
For the ladies,
always the added touch.

342
00:28:44,141 --> 00:28:47,686
That's it. Drink it all up!

343
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:57,905
The night's not over. I know this
after-hours bar we can take him to.

344
00:28:58,113 --> 00:29:01,492
No, no. I couldn't.
I gotta go to practice in the morning.

345
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:05,120
I'd love to stay and throw up.

346
00:29:05,329 --> 00:29:08,874
But I got to beat
these sons of bitches.

347
00:29:09,082 --> 00:29:14,922
Hear that, Boston?
I'm gonna kick your ass!

348
00:29:18,592 --> 00:29:22,846
- Lightweight.
- He can't even hold his liquor.

349
00:29:23,055 --> 00:29:25,891
Let's get him a cab.

350
00:29:41,657 --> 00:29:44,743
I'm not a hero, I'm a plumber.

351
00:29:44,952 --> 00:29:50,666
If your septic tank is backing up,
your hot water takes a leak,

352
00:29:50,874 --> 00:29:53,919
your air cooler won't work,
well, call me.

353
00:29:54,127 --> 00:29:58,632
Because I am not a hero.
I am a plumber.

354
00:29:58,841 --> 00:30:00,926
Plumber...

355
00:30:42,092 --> 00:30:49,266
Oh, God! Jimmy!
Lewis Scott's in the bed!

356
00:30:49,474 --> 00:30:54,104
- How did he get there?
- I blanked out. What happened?

357
00:30:54,313 --> 00:30:57,441
We must've done it when he passed out.
We kidnapped him.

358
00:30:57,649 --> 00:30:59,735
I did not kidnap anybody!

359
00:30:59,943 --> 00:31:04,156
Scott is duct-taped in my bed
and I don't think he did it himself.

360
00:31:04,364 --> 00:31:09,244
- You wanted to look him in the eye!
- No more hard liquor for me!

361
00:31:09,453 --> 00:31:13,415
- Look, we got to get him out of here.
- I agree.

362
00:31:13,624 --> 00:31:16,585
But first, we have to do something.

363
00:31:22,883 --> 00:31:25,594
- He's gotta wear a hat or something.
- We gotta go!

364
00:31:25,802 --> 00:31:28,430
Put a Celtics hat on the guy.

365
00:31:35,646 --> 00:31:39,399
- Did you call his room again?
- Five minutes ago. He's not there.

366
00:31:39,608 --> 00:31:42,361
Wait five minutes and then call again!

367
00:31:44,947 --> 00:31:48,075
Oh, man!
Wait till the boys see this!

368
00:31:48,283 --> 00:31:51,411
Seventh game of the finals
and he ditches practice!

369
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:55,916
Grant Hill would have gone to church
and come to practice early.

370
00:32:00,546 --> 00:32:02,881
Watch his head.

371
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:06,468
We don't need Scott.
Bench him and teach him a lesson.

372
00:32:06,677 --> 00:32:11,807
Yeah. I'll bench my high scorer.
Our fans won't want me too dead.

373
00:32:12,015 --> 00:32:16,812
We just got to get him outside. Then
he can go where the hell he wants.

374
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:20,983
-Jeez. He's coming to.
-Just relax and enjoy the ride!

375
00:32:21,191 --> 00:32:25,487
<i>FrereJacques, frereJacques
dormez vous</i>

376
00:32:25,696 --> 00:32:27,281
Hey, let go of me!

377
00:32:27,489 --> 00:32:30,576
<i>Sonnez les matines
Sonnez les matines</i>

378
00:32:30,784 --> 00:32:34,037
Let go of me!
You're the two guys at the club.

379
00:32:34,246 --> 00:32:38,959
- Relax. He doesn't know our names.
-Jimmy Flaherty and Mike O'Hara.

380
00:32:42,754 --> 00:32:45,924
Jimmy, where are you going?

381
00:32:46,133 --> 00:32:48,427
Don't make me hurt you.

382
00:32:51,346 --> 00:32:56,476
- You'd better untie me right now!
- That's it! You want some of this?

383
00:32:59,062 --> 00:33:00,981
Jimmy!

384
00:33:03,192 --> 00:33:07,196
Hold it right there, ball hog!
Gun, gun, gun, gun, gun.

385
00:33:08,238 --> 00:33:11,992
Smile for the barrel. All right.

386
00:33:12,201 --> 00:33:16,330
- Get upstairs, now!
- Watch yourself.

387
00:33:17,748 --> 00:33:23,504
Yo, Coach! I'll play. Just give me
a chance. I can handle the rock.

388
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:26,006
I'll call you if I need you.

389
00:33:26,215 --> 00:33:29,843
Don't dog me, Coach.
I've got the bad crap.

390
00:33:30,052 --> 00:33:33,972
I'll tell you what. You take the bad
crap and this basketball,

391
00:33:34,181 --> 00:33:37,684
and do the drills! Now!

392
00:33:38,977 --> 00:33:42,523
-"Bad crap".
- I'll call again.

393
00:33:50,405 --> 00:33:53,242
I didn't know you even had a gun.

394
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:58,413
It's a Russian TOZ-35. Skanaker won
the gold in the '72 Olympics with it.

395
00:33:58,622 --> 00:34:01,291
I traded my Gordie Howe skates for it.

396
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:05,879
What is this?
I thought you two were Utah fans.

397
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:08,423
Yeah, right.

398
00:34:08,632 --> 00:34:13,178
Is this racism? A backlash
from the O.J. Simpson verdict?

399
00:34:13,387 --> 00:34:17,891
Racism? If the Sox were
in the pennant race with the Orioles,

400
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,936
we'd tie up Cal Ripkin Jr. He's white.

401
00:34:21,144 --> 00:34:24,731
Then why don't you
go get his white ass?

402
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:30,487
We need time to figure this out. Why
don't you get us some coffee and food?

403
00:34:30,696 --> 00:34:36,201
Yeah, OK. I'll get some bananas
and make banana pancakes.

404
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:40,706
Some eggs, sausages and bacon
and make a Spanish omelette.

405
00:34:40,914 --> 00:34:45,502
We could go Italian, Chinese, Greek.
I know a great Dutch place...

406
00:34:45,711 --> 00:34:48,505
We're not having a party!
Get some coffee and food!

407
00:34:48,714 --> 00:34:52,342
- We want to make it nice for him.
- I'll get it myself.

408
00:34:52,551 --> 00:34:54,678
Who are you, man?

409
00:34:54,887 --> 00:34:58,765
Some bitter ex-high school player
who never really made it?

410
00:34:58,974 --> 00:35:04,938
You sit watching sports, criticizing
athletes 'cause you wish it was you.

411
00:35:07,232 --> 00:35:09,776
You are so far off...

412
00:35:11,111 --> 00:35:12,863
..it's sad.

413
00:35:19,411 --> 00:35:21,079
Watch his ass!

414
00:35:26,084 --> 00:35:30,380
- You let him talk to you like that?
- What do you mean?

415
00:35:30,589 --> 00:35:34,009
He's so condescending.
"Watch his ass!"

416
00:35:39,306 --> 00:35:41,767
- You're under arrest!
- Hi, Kev.

417
00:35:41,975 --> 00:35:44,811
Hi, Mike. What's up?

418
00:35:46,313 --> 00:35:49,149
Scared you, didn't I?
What's new, man?

419
00:35:49,358 --> 00:35:51,735
New?

420
00:35:51,944 --> 00:35:56,031
Officer, I'm the guy
who had his car stolen.

421
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:00,327
Stand by where your car was stolen
and I'll be right there.

422
00:36:00,536 --> 00:36:04,289
- Big game tomorrow.
- The Celtics have to win.

423
00:36:04,498 --> 00:36:09,044
- I wanted to ask you something...
- What about my fucking car?

424
00:36:09,253 --> 00:36:14,174
- That Porsche was two months old!
- We do our best. I truly am sorry.

425
00:36:14,383 --> 00:36:18,178
I realise without that nice car
you have no chance of getting laid.

426
00:36:18,387 --> 00:36:25,102
That's a real tragedy. Now step back!
I'll be with you in a moment.

427
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:29,064
He talks to you like you're
his little bitch or something.

428
00:36:29,273 --> 00:36:33,485
I wouldn't be surprised if he comes
back with some hot pants for you.

429
00:36:33,694 --> 00:36:39,241
You know, I was thinking...
Lewis Scott is killing us.

430
00:36:39,449 --> 00:36:40,784
I hate that guy.

431
00:36:40,993 --> 00:36:45,497
You know what someone should do?
Someone should grab Lewis Scott,

432
00:36:45,706 --> 00:36:50,377
tie him up and hold him till after
we finish that game tomorrow.

433
00:36:50,586 --> 00:36:52,713
You know what? I'm in.

434
00:36:52,921 --> 00:36:56,425
And I'm crazy enough to do it.
I'd do it.

435
00:36:56,633 --> 00:36:59,428
My team-mates will
come looking for me.

436
00:36:59,636 --> 00:37:02,598
Why? Is it so unusual
you're not at practice?

437
00:37:02,806 --> 00:37:06,268
You're in big trouble
for messing with Lewis Scott.

438
00:37:06,476 --> 00:37:10,105
You just shut up.
Jimmy's in control now.

439
00:37:10,314 --> 00:37:13,275
See, I can talk
in the third person, too.

440
00:37:13,483 --> 00:37:16,361
Jimmy Flaherty wants Lewis Scott
to shut his trap.

441
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:21,575
Jimmy Flaherty is so tired
of Lewis Scott's bullshit!

442
00:37:21,783 --> 00:37:25,496
Well, Jimmy wouldn't talk like that
if he didn't have a gun,

443
00:37:25,704 --> 00:37:29,416
'cause Lewis Scott would pulverize
his big, fat, frumpy ass.

444
00:37:29,625 --> 00:37:33,003
But Jimmy Flaherty
does have a gun, doesn't he?

445
00:37:35,881 --> 00:37:41,178
Hey! You don't want to play
with Flaherty. He's crazy.

446
00:37:41,386 --> 00:37:45,432
Yeah? I'm about to snatch your
asshole out and use it as a peephole.

447
00:37:45,641 --> 00:37:50,604
Sit down! Please, Lewis!
Don't make me shoot you, man!

448
00:37:50,812 --> 00:37:53,607
You won't shoot me.
You don't have the berries.

449
00:37:53,815 --> 00:37:56,902
I do have the berries!
If you don't sit down, I'm...

450
00:37:57,110 --> 00:38:03,617
- Shit! That could have been my head!
- I wish it was.

451
00:38:03,826 --> 00:38:07,204
That was my 1 986 Bill Buckner ball.

452
00:38:07,412 --> 00:38:12,209
Say somebody grabbed him yesterday
and let go of him today.

453
00:38:12,417 --> 00:38:16,213
Kidnapping is kidnapping. It doesn't
matter if it's one day or three days.

454
00:38:16,421 --> 00:38:21,009
If you kidnap a guy, you kidnap him.
I mean, just do it.

455
00:38:21,218 --> 00:38:27,182
So you'd hold on to him until after
the Celtics win the championship?

456
00:38:27,391 --> 00:38:31,603
Me? As a policeman sworn to uphold
the law, I could never say that.

457
00:38:31,812 --> 00:38:35,148
But as a Celtics fan,
I must reply "Yes".

458
00:38:35,357 --> 00:38:39,695
We're just joking around. We're not
talking about a crime here, are we?

459
00:38:41,113 --> 00:38:44,533
No! Of course not.

460
00:38:46,243 --> 00:38:47,953
Well...

461
00:38:48,162 --> 00:38:51,373
- Yeah, OK. Give my love to Deb.
- See you later.

462
00:38:51,582 --> 00:38:55,294
I got no reason to be concerned,
do I, Mike? Huh?

463
00:38:55,502 --> 00:39:00,340
- Kevin, you're losing it, man!
-Take care. Stay out of trouble.

464
00:39:02,718 --> 00:39:05,345
OK, Mr Germany, where were we?

465
00:39:06,513 --> 00:39:11,185
- Why do you collect all this junk?
- I like it. It's a hobby.

466
00:39:11,393 --> 00:39:16,023
It's pathetic. All these pictures
of other people's achievements.

467
00:39:16,231 --> 00:39:19,234
And what have you done?
What's your claim to fame?

468
00:39:19,443 --> 00:39:22,696
You think
Larry Bird has a picture of you,

469
00:39:22,905 --> 00:39:25,699
your hand down a toilet,
wrangling a turd?

470
00:39:25,908 --> 00:39:29,661
He doesn't even know you exist,
and you met him.

471
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:33,123
Put that gun in your mouth
and blow your brains out.

472
00:39:34,166 --> 00:39:38,754
I know you've thought about it.
On holidays, your birthday.

473
00:39:38,962 --> 00:39:44,801
How about New Year's, when you're
sitting here playing with your knob,

474
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:48,138
and everyone else out there
having fun.

475
00:39:48,347 --> 00:39:53,060
Go ahead, Jimmy. Do it.
Make the pain go away.

476
00:39:53,977 --> 00:39:56,522
Stifle it, Scott!

477
00:39:56,730 --> 00:40:00,859
That's exactly why your so-called
friend Mike treats you that way.

478
00:40:01,068 --> 00:40:06,031
- You have no identity of your own.
- He treats me just fine.

479
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:10,911
It took me two seconds to figure out
who the man in the relationship was.

480
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:15,624
He wouldn't even let you make
the banana pancakes.

481
00:40:17,334 --> 00:40:20,712
I was going to make them, too.
I was in the mood.

482
00:40:20,921 --> 00:40:26,802
Does he make you hold his peenie
when he takes a piss, too, Jimmy?

483
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:31,348
<i>I wouldn't be surprised if he comes
back with some hot pants for you.</i>

484
00:40:32,266 --> 00:40:35,686
- Come on, make us some breakfast.
- Coming!

485
00:40:35,894 --> 00:40:39,147
I saw Kevin when I was out.
I hinted about us.

486
00:40:39,356 --> 00:40:43,402
It doesn't matter if we let him go
now or later. Same thing.

487
00:40:47,156 --> 00:40:50,242
- What did you do that for?
- I'm sick of your bullshit!

488
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:54,204
What the hell's gotten into you? Huh?

489
00:40:55,789 --> 00:40:57,666
Oh, no.

490
00:41:00,502 --> 00:41:03,672
You really shouldn't
leave Jimmy all alone, Mike.

491
00:41:03,881 --> 00:41:07,968
- You just get out.
- No, Jimmy, don't listen to him!

492
00:41:08,177 --> 00:41:10,429
"Yes, master,
I'll do whatever you say."

493
00:41:10,637 --> 00:41:14,474
- Pick on someone with your own IQ.
- How about someone like you?

494
00:41:14,683 --> 00:41:18,437
I'd like to get him in a room,
tie him down,

495
00:41:18,645 --> 00:41:21,273
and beat the living snot out of him!

496
00:41:21,481 --> 00:41:25,110
There are some people in this world,
that's all they really understand.

497
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:28,822
You rationalize with them,
listen to their side of the story.

498
00:41:29,031 --> 00:41:32,701
But ultimately, it comes down
to one thing. A good beating!

499
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:34,953
Maybe something happened to him.

500
00:41:35,162 --> 00:41:37,539
Like it's the first time
he's pulled this.

501
00:41:37,748 --> 00:41:42,211
- Listen to me.
- I can't believe I hit you.

502
00:41:42,419 --> 00:41:45,589
I talked to Kevin.
We're in deep trouble.

503
00:41:45,797 --> 00:41:49,593
- We're probably going to jail.
- What do we do?

504
00:41:49,801 --> 00:41:54,139
We've no choice.
If we let him go now,

505
00:41:54,348 --> 00:41:57,726
our lives go down in flames
and we have nothing to show.

506
00:41:57,935 --> 00:42:04,066
But if we hold on to him till after
the game and the Celtics win,

507
00:42:04,274 --> 00:42:09,488
our lives will go down in flames, but
we'll have contributed to the victory!

508
00:42:09,696 --> 00:42:11,448
I like this very much.

509
00:42:11,657 --> 00:42:14,910
All our lives, we've taken
from the Celtics.

510
00:42:15,118 --> 00:42:17,538
It's time to give something back.

511
00:42:17,746 --> 00:42:24,628
On a team, everybody's got a job.
So our job is to cover Lewis Scott!

512
00:42:24,837 --> 00:42:30,717
And if we can hold onto him,
maybe we can win that championship.

513
00:42:30,926 --> 00:42:32,970
It wouldn't be a fair win.

514
00:42:33,178 --> 00:42:36,723
There'd be an asterisk
next to it in the record book.

515
00:42:36,932 --> 00:42:39,226
It would have our names next to it.

516
00:42:39,434 --> 00:42:43,272
What kind of loser
would want to be an asterisk?

517
00:42:44,106 --> 00:42:50,779
I would very much like to be one.
Let's lead our Celtics to victory!

518
00:42:51,947 --> 00:42:58,412
Lurch, we're going to run the plays.
Do the best you can. That's all I ask.

519
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:03,792
- I will not let my homies down.
- Your homies are going to love that.

520
00:43:04,001 --> 00:43:06,670
Come on, Jimmy, the rock!

521
00:43:13,218 --> 00:43:15,179
I hate my life.

522
00:43:15,387 --> 00:43:20,142
- Give him another chance.
- I have given him so many chances.

523
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:24,188
I love him,
but he's just not good for us.

524
00:43:24,396 --> 00:43:28,442
Will I only see him Sundays
like my other divorced friends?

525
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:31,653
Tommy.
Football season's coming up.

526
00:43:31,862 --> 00:43:35,699
I don't think your dad's gonna see
you Sunday. Maybe February.

527
00:43:35,908 --> 00:43:40,662
- Two-fifty-five! Hut-hut-hut!
- Blitz him, blitz him, blitz him!

528
00:43:40,871 --> 00:43:44,333
Go all the way! Yes!

529
00:43:44,541 --> 00:43:47,794
-Jesus, Jimmy, you clipped him!
- No, that wasn't.

530
00:43:48,003 --> 00:43:52,049
He's going all the way! Oh, yeah!

531
00:43:52,257 --> 00:43:56,303
You guys are really good at this.
You ever think about going pro?

532
00:43:56,512 --> 00:44:01,433
Here it goes! Bring it down now!
Bring it hard! That's it!

533
00:44:01,642 --> 00:44:05,604
Bring it down! Yeah, yeah, yeah!

534
00:44:05,812 --> 00:44:10,526
- Big Jim Fulton! How's his shoulder?
- He had that rotator cuff surgery.

535
00:44:10,734 --> 00:44:16,031
- Did it affect his power chop?
- Yes, but not his log rolling.

536
00:44:16,281 --> 00:44:19,117
Thank God. Wouldn't want
nothing happening to the log rolling.

537
00:44:19,326 --> 00:44:23,455
These guys are so classy.
There's no prize money here.

538
00:44:23,664 --> 00:44:26,208
They're in it for the love of the game.

539
00:44:26,416 --> 00:44:30,003
You wouldn't see
Big Jim Fulton hawking chainsaws.

540
00:44:30,212 --> 00:44:34,675
<i>Hi. I'm Big Jim Fulton. When I'm
cutting 'em, I reach for the best.</i>

541
00:44:36,176 --> 00:44:38,971
- It's Big Jim Fulton.
- Well, I...

542
00:44:39,179 --> 00:44:44,184
I can see why he'd do that.
McCulloch makes a heck of a product.

543
00:44:44,393 --> 00:44:48,981
That just proves no one's above it.
What about you, doo-doo-digger?

544
00:44:49,189 --> 00:44:53,026
If they offered you a million to do
a Tidy Bowl commercial, would you?

545
00:44:53,235 --> 00:44:58,282
In a case like that, that's a product
I believe in, I suppose I would.

546
00:44:58,490 --> 00:45:02,119
Why do you do all those commercials?

547
00:45:02,327 --> 00:45:05,664
Come on, you don't need the money!
You know what I think?

548
00:45:05,873 --> 00:45:10,669
You think that if we see your face
on TV a million times a day,

549
00:45:10,878 --> 00:45:13,130
we're going to love you.

550
00:45:13,338 --> 00:45:17,634
I don't need your love. I don't want
to talk about this any more.

551
00:45:17,843 --> 00:45:21,638
I don't do no more commercials
than anybody else.

552
00:45:21,847 --> 00:45:28,312
I'll play a game. I'll flip through
every station on this TV.

553
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:32,191
And if I don't see one
of your commercials, I'll let you go.

554
00:45:32,399 --> 00:45:35,319
- Bet!
- That's kind of a risk there, Mike.

555
00:45:35,569 --> 00:45:40,240
- He's on TV every ten seconds!
- Come on, let's go.

556
00:45:40,449 --> 00:45:43,994
OK. Let's play.
I'll start with two here.

557
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,335
Want to pick up the pace?

558
00:45:51,543 --> 00:45:54,087
<i>..in a limo this small.</i>

559
00:45:56,048 --> 00:45:58,467
- OK.
- I'm gonna win this thing.

560
00:45:58,675 --> 00:46:01,303
I've got 1 25 channels on the dish.

561
00:46:01,512 --> 00:46:05,307
Keep changing channels.
You're almost out. This is it.

562
00:46:05,516 --> 00:46:10,395
- Untie me, baby. I'm home free.
- No, we got ESPN-2 coming up.

563
00:46:11,855 --> 00:46:17,236
- "..still got my thumbs."
- "..This awful rash..."

564
00:46:18,612 --> 00:46:23,367
<i>Let's play. A pack of Oscar Mayer
fat-free turkey dogs for the winner.</i>

565
00:46:28,121 --> 00:46:31,041
Selling those wieners!

566
00:46:32,334 --> 00:46:35,045
Here comes my favourite part!

567
00:46:35,254 --> 00:46:39,424
<i>I'll play one-on-one
with this hot dog any day!</i>

568
00:46:39,633 --> 00:46:43,345
"I'll play one-on-one
with this hot dog any day"!

569
00:46:46,932 --> 00:46:49,184
Will you shut it off?
Change the channel.

570
00:46:50,644 --> 00:46:53,647
- Help!
- Get him in the kitchen!

571
00:46:53,856 --> 00:46:56,859
Get him back there, now.

572
00:46:57,067 --> 00:47:00,362
It's Carol and Tommy.
Get him in there!

573
00:47:00,571 --> 00:47:02,197
OK.

574
00:47:02,698 --> 00:47:06,160
Carol, Tommy, hey! What a surprise.

575
00:47:06,368 --> 00:47:09,580
It's not really a good time right now.

576
00:47:09,788 --> 00:47:15,169
We just stopped by to bring some stuff
you might need and to say goodbye.

577
00:47:15,377 --> 00:47:19,298
- What is this?
- The rest of your stuff.

578
00:47:19,506 --> 00:47:22,509
You think I'll spend the rest
of my life with Jimmy?

579
00:47:22,718 --> 00:47:25,971
I can't live with someone
who refuses to grow.

580
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:32,436
I can grow, are you kidding me?
I'm practically sprouting right now!

581
00:47:34,479 --> 00:47:39,067
Carol, look. I was thinking a lot
about it, and you were right.

582
00:47:39,276 --> 00:47:43,614
You were right!
I think I've become a little bit...

583
00:47:43,822 --> 00:47:47,951
- Obsessed.
- Obsessed with sports. You're right!

584
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,996
You're just repeating what I said
to placate me.

585
00:47:51,205 --> 00:47:56,877
No. I'm going to change.
I'm going to become a new man.

586
00:47:58,045 --> 00:48:02,341
Hey, you know what I was thinking?
We'll go back to that therapist!

587
00:48:02,549 --> 00:48:06,678
We can talk it out. We'll talk,
we can hold each other.

588
00:48:06,887 --> 00:48:14,269
We can even cry! And I promise
I won't try to smack him this time.

589
00:48:14,478 --> 00:48:19,149
Fine. I'll call Dr Kaufman and make
an appointment for Monday.

590
00:48:19,358 --> 00:48:22,236
- Then we'll see.
- It's a date!

591
00:48:22,444 --> 00:48:24,905
Doc Kaufman's on Monday!

592
00:48:31,662 --> 00:48:35,415
You miserable son of a bitch!

593
00:48:35,624 --> 00:48:39,127
- Think I got a girl in there?
- It didn't take you long.

594
00:48:39,336 --> 00:48:42,548
- It's Jimmy.Jimmy?
- Yeah.

595
00:48:42,756 --> 00:48:48,303
- He's whipping up a bundt cake.
- Good one, Dad. Bundt cake.

596
00:48:48,512 --> 00:48:52,558
Yes. Hey, don't go in there!
Do not go in there!

597
00:48:54,226 --> 00:48:58,021
- Carol. Tommy.
- See. It's Jimmy.

598
00:48:58,230 --> 00:49:02,609
And...why is this man tied up?

599
00:49:04,903 --> 00:49:06,446
For fun.

600
00:49:08,073 --> 00:49:11,410
-Just guy stuff.
- Having fun with the guys.

601
00:49:11,618 --> 00:49:15,664
- Hey, you're Lewis Scott!
- Who is Lewis Scott?

602
00:49:15,873 --> 00:49:18,208
Who is...? Are you kidding me?

603
00:49:18,417 --> 00:49:22,671
That is exactly what is
wrong with our relationship.

604
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:28,594
I kidnap the greatest player in the NBA,
and you don't know who he is!

605
00:49:28,802 --> 00:49:30,846
Mr Scott, I think you're the greatest.

606
00:49:38,562 --> 00:49:42,149
He says thanks for the compliment.

607
00:49:42,357 --> 00:49:46,487
See you later because we gotta be
going now, and good afternoon.

608
00:49:49,364 --> 00:49:52,034
You are sick! You need help!

609
00:49:52,242 --> 00:49:55,162
You don't know what's going on!
We have a plan!

610
00:49:55,370 --> 00:50:01,376
I have a plan. I am calling the cops,
then I'm divorcing you. Let's go.

611
00:50:03,545 --> 00:50:06,840
- You're still my hero.
-Thanks.

612
00:50:07,049 --> 00:50:09,593
Not you, Dad. I meant Lewis.

613
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:23,565
I haven't seen Carol that mad since
'8 7, when I drop-kicked her Chia pet.

614
00:50:23,774 --> 00:50:25,108
I remember.

615
00:50:25,317 --> 00:50:29,238
Let her go. Who needs
a loving, supportive wife like that?

616
00:50:29,446 --> 00:50:33,283
A strong-jawed, athletic,
rim-minded gym teacher like you?

617
00:50:33,492 --> 00:50:39,456
Every woman in Boston must want to get
into bed with your pasty, bloated ass.

618
00:50:39,665 --> 00:50:44,503
Shut up before I bring your head
over here and use it as a cue ball.

619
00:50:44,711 --> 00:50:48,215
Excuse me, gym teacher.
May I use the bathroom?

620
00:50:49,967 --> 00:50:55,180
- We're not falling for that trick.
- Do you think I wore a pamper here?

621
00:50:55,389 --> 00:50:58,350
You should go in there
with him just to be safe.

622
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:04,231
- That is not going to happen.
- Fine. There's bars on the window.

623
00:51:04,439 --> 00:51:09,278
If you try anything, he'll blow holes
through this door until you're dead.

624
00:51:09,486 --> 00:51:13,448
- Yeah, that's me, John Dillinger.
- Relax, I'm just going to pee.

625
00:51:13,657 --> 00:51:18,745
-Jimmy, want to help me uncoil it?
- He better just be peeing.

626
00:51:22,624 --> 00:51:28,172
We should get out of here. Carol was
pissed. She might be calling the cops.

627
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:31,175
She very well might,
knowing her the way I do.

628
00:51:35,179 --> 00:51:39,183
- Who's that?
- I want my rent money, Jimmy!

629
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:43,479
It's Nick, the landlord.
He's got a key. He's the landlord.

630
00:51:45,731 --> 00:51:48,609
- $300. Cough it up.
-Just pay the man.

631
00:51:48,817 --> 00:51:52,404
- I don't have it.
- Cough it up.

632
00:51:52,613 --> 00:51:57,618
I'm installing a whirlpool spa
next week, and Friday I'll have...

633
00:51:57,826 --> 00:52:00,579
-Just write the man a cheque.
- It'll bounce.

634
00:52:00,787 --> 00:52:03,957
- Write it anyway.
-Jimmy!

635
00:52:04,166 --> 00:52:08,504
Mikey, there's a $20 penalty
for writing out bounced cheques.

636
00:52:08,712 --> 00:52:15,010
All right. I am going to pay
Nick the landlord.

637
00:52:15,219 --> 00:52:19,014
- You don't deserve a friend like this.
- Damn straight.

638
00:52:19,223 --> 00:52:23,977
Thanks for the hostage-tality, guys.
But I really gotta go.

639
00:52:28,315 --> 00:52:30,859
I don't believe what I just saw!

640
00:52:31,068 --> 00:52:34,905
- Nick, lock it up!
- Was that Lewis Scott?

641
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:39,785
There!

642
00:52:51,922 --> 00:52:55,968
- Those guys are physically fit!
- We'll never catch him this way.

643
00:52:56,176 --> 00:53:01,849
- Keep up. Take a warning shot.
- I'm a terrible aim. I might hit him.

644
00:53:05,435 --> 00:53:07,104
Taxi!

645
00:53:08,355 --> 00:53:12,693
- Yo, my man.Just drive, drive.
- Hey, you're Lewis Scott.

646
00:53:12,901 --> 00:53:15,863
- Yeah, it's me. Step on it.
- Get out of my cab.

647
00:53:16,071 --> 00:53:19,491
- This is an emergency.
- After what you did to my Celtics?

648
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:24,746
- Get out of my cab now.
- What is this? The Twilight Zone?

649
00:53:29,293 --> 00:53:32,421
- Hi, Grandma.
- Hi, Peanut.

650
00:53:32,629 --> 00:53:36,884
- What's wrong?
- Bill Russell is awful sad.

651
00:53:37,092 --> 00:53:41,096
- The Celtics lost.
- Don't worry, Billy Boy.

652
00:53:41,305 --> 00:53:44,099
Mikey and I'll take care of it.
See you.

653
00:53:50,689 --> 00:53:53,317
- Hey!
- This way, dumb ass!

654
00:54:14,338 --> 00:54:16,798
Lewis, come on!

655
00:54:18,592 --> 00:54:24,723
- Hey! Get in the van! I mean it!
- You'd hit me in front of a cop?

656
00:54:25,849 --> 00:54:27,351
Officer!

657
00:54:32,898 --> 00:54:36,193
This is bizarre.

658
00:54:38,237 --> 00:54:41,698
Hey! Where are you going? Hey!

659
00:54:41,907 --> 00:54:44,368
Nothing personal, man.

660
00:54:46,787 --> 00:54:49,706
I wish the Utah fans
were this passionate.

661
00:54:49,915 --> 00:54:52,835
Hey, Cramden,
where are we going?

662
00:54:53,043 --> 00:54:58,757
Nowhere. We're just going to
drive around till after the game.

663
00:54:58,966 --> 00:55:01,760
I see you put a lot of thought
into this.

664
00:55:05,264 --> 00:55:08,183
Hey, you have
any music in this tin can?

665
00:55:08,392 --> 00:55:10,018
Sure.

666
00:55:21,405 --> 00:55:26,285
Hey! Turn it off! Give me the gun,
I'll shoot myself in the head.

667
00:55:37,921 --> 00:55:41,800
Hey, listen. I got a little
business proposition for you.

668
00:55:42,009 --> 00:55:46,555
What if I told you I knew
the Celtics were a lock on game 7?

669
00:55:46,763 --> 00:55:49,141
Could we make some money?

670
00:55:49,349 --> 00:55:53,854
Yeah...
No, VERY inside information.

671
00:55:57,232 --> 00:56:01,987
- Your gaslight's on.
- Well, look for a filling station.

672
00:56:07,075 --> 00:56:10,746
Did you see that blonde
in the new Guess ad?

673
00:56:10,954 --> 00:56:15,209
I saw that the other night.
I was going to call you.

674
00:56:15,417 --> 00:56:20,964
- Talking about Michelle?
- What, you know her?

675
00:56:21,173 --> 00:56:23,592
- Every nook and cranny.
- Get outta here.

676
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:28,430
- In the biblical sense?
-Just say we never made it to church.

677
00:56:29,431 --> 00:56:33,644
- Don't say that. You're killing me!
- Your fantasies are my reality.

678
00:56:33,852 --> 00:56:36,313
Cough it up, man. We want the details.

679
00:56:36,522 --> 00:56:40,943
I better give you some toilet paper
and WD-40, 'cause I got stories, yo.

680
00:56:41,151 --> 00:56:45,948
You know the Budweiser ad girl?
Been there, done that.

681
00:56:47,074 --> 00:56:51,537
I bet you guys couldn't get past
first base with the Budweiser frog.

682
00:56:51,745 --> 00:56:54,706
That would depend how drunk I got it.

683
00:56:58,085 --> 00:57:02,297
Man, I've been with two women
in my whole life.

684
00:57:02,506 --> 00:57:06,468
- That's two more than Jimmy.
- That's cruel, but true.

685
00:57:13,016 --> 00:57:14,852
Wow.

686
00:57:17,271 --> 00:57:20,732
Gas. Let's stop for gas.

687
00:57:24,069 --> 00:57:29,366
You pump, I'll pay.
And you, you wait in there.

688
00:57:29,575 --> 00:57:31,910
I hope you die!

689
00:57:55,267 --> 00:57:58,645
- OK, wide ass! Unchain me.
- Get back in the van.

690
00:57:58,854 --> 00:58:02,900
Unchain me right now, or I'll blow
this place to kingdom come!

691
00:58:03,108 --> 00:58:05,819
I leave you alone for
two minutes and what happens?

692
00:58:10,657 --> 00:58:14,620
- Let him go, Jimmy!
- Otherwise we'll have a weenie roast!

693
00:58:14,828 --> 00:58:17,206
- Do it!
- No can do, man.

694
00:58:17,414 --> 00:58:19,541
I'll sacrifice for our boys in green.

695
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:24,046
You're willing to sacrifice my nuts?
What is the matter with you?

696
00:58:24,254 --> 00:58:28,133
- Did he get in your head again?
- No, it's completely blank.

697
00:58:28,342 --> 00:58:33,138
- Then you must be willing to die.
-Jimmy! Jimmy!

698
00:58:33,347 --> 00:58:38,352
No one's dying. That lighter hasn't
worked since Dukakis was governor.

699
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:40,103
Oh, yeah?

700
00:58:40,312 --> 00:58:44,733
- Let him go, Jimmy!
- Give me that thing! Get in the van!

701
00:58:44,942 --> 00:58:48,695
Help him with his bowl.

702
00:58:48,904 --> 00:58:52,449
Be careful.
It's a top-of-the-line quiet flush.

703
00:58:53,867 --> 00:58:56,620
Thanks for telling me about the lighter.

704
00:59:00,499 --> 00:59:05,879
I'm soaking wet, and the van smells
like gasoline! Give me a light.

705
00:59:07,798 --> 00:59:09,967
Well, look at that. It works.

706
00:59:13,262 --> 00:59:17,641
Guys. Please don't take this from me.

707
00:59:19,810 --> 00:59:24,523
Let me go. I won't turn you in,
I swear. You don't want to go to jail!

708
00:59:25,691 --> 00:59:28,485
Mike, you got a wife and a kid!

709
00:59:28,694 --> 00:59:33,198
Jimmy, you've got...Mike,
and he's got a wife and a kid.

710
00:59:34,491 --> 00:59:38,829
- Please don't take this from me!
- You don't deserve it.

711
00:59:39,037 --> 00:59:43,125
- What, and you do?
- At least I'd appreciate it.

712
00:59:43,333 --> 00:59:46,420
I would cherish every minute
of every game.

713
00:59:46,628 --> 00:59:51,758
I wouldn't skip practice or be ragging
on my team-mates! I'd work hard!

714
00:59:51,967 --> 00:59:57,764
You don't think I work hard?
I gave up everything for the game!

715
00:59:57,973 --> 01:00:01,852
- Big deal. I'd have given it up, too.
- Would you have, Mike?

716
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:06,231
- What do I have to give up?
- Yeah.

717
01:00:07,357 --> 01:00:11,069
I'm the one born with the talent,
not you.

718
01:00:12,362 --> 01:00:15,491
Sorry, but don't take it out on me.

719
01:00:15,699 --> 01:00:18,702
You don't think I've got the talent?

720
01:00:18,911 --> 01:00:22,539
You're a gym teacher.
What do you think?

721
01:00:24,082 --> 01:00:25,667
Pull over.

722
01:00:25,918 --> 01:00:28,587
Come on, Mr P.E.,
show me what you got.

723
01:00:30,422 --> 01:00:35,886
I'm Bob Cousy here at Lapristy Park
with the Boston skyline behind me,

724
01:00:36,094 --> 01:00:41,350
here at this grudge match,
a David and Goliath contest between

725
01:00:41,558 --> 01:00:44,478
Lewis Scott, NBA All Star

726
01:00:44,686 --> 01:00:48,482
and Mike O'Hara,
a gym teacher from Charlestown

727
01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:53,153
with a spastic colon
and a few surprises up his sleeve.

728
01:00:53,362 --> 01:00:58,242
Is Mike O'Hara's dream dead? We'll
see after a word from this sponsor.

729
01:00:58,450 --> 01:01:00,160
I'm Lewis Scott.

730
01:01:00,369 --> 01:01:03,455
As well as being a basketball player,
I'm also a denture wearer.

731
01:01:03,664 --> 01:01:04,998
Shut up!

732
01:01:05,207 --> 01:01:09,002
- Let's play!
- I'm going right. Oops.

733
01:01:09,211 --> 01:01:11,380
- You reach, I teach.
- Shut up and play.

734
01:01:13,924 --> 01:01:16,552
If you was a midget,
I'd take you to the hole.

735
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:19,721
If you was crippled,
I'd have you rubbing that nub.

736
01:01:20,889 --> 01:01:25,102
If you was an old woman with no teeth,
I'd still have you gummin'.

737
01:01:25,310 --> 01:01:28,230
If you was my bitch, I'd do that to you.

738
01:01:28,438 --> 01:01:32,442
- Shut up!
- Come on, hit the weight room!

739
01:01:34,361 --> 01:01:39,158
Get up, you fat foetus.
Oh, the kid is nice, the kid is nice!

740
01:01:39,366 --> 01:01:42,244
Take a breather, Mike.
I'm gonna shoot threes.

741
01:01:42,452 --> 01:01:45,122
You'd be a great ball boy.

742
01:01:45,330 --> 01:01:49,960
- Get the ball, boy, 'cause it's over.
- It's not over till I say it's over!

743
01:01:50,169 --> 01:01:51,587
Oh, God!

744
01:01:51,795 --> 01:01:55,257
- Oh, Jeez, are you OK?
- No, I'm not OK!

745
01:01:55,465 --> 01:01:57,634
Ice! Get him some ice!

746
01:02:01,763 --> 01:02:04,558
All right, give me the key. The keys!

747
01:02:04,766 --> 01:02:07,853
- He has the gun!
- Give him the keys!

748
01:02:09,563 --> 01:02:11,315
Thank you.

749
01:02:13,817 --> 01:02:15,986
Scott?

750
01:02:16,195 --> 01:02:20,282
- What, stink hands?
- Are you turning us in to the police?

751
01:02:20,491 --> 01:02:26,288
No. I got something much worse
planned for you two.

752
01:02:27,539 --> 01:02:31,919
- You're going to root for me.
- I'm not rooting for you!

753
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:40,010
See you ladies at the game. Pray
I win, otherwise you're going to jail.

754
01:02:41,011 --> 01:02:45,390
Hey. Wear something purple.

755
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:49,561
Wear something purple.

756
01:02:53,857 --> 01:02:56,318
Lunch is almost ready.

757
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:02,991
I have nothing to say to you.

758
01:03:07,579 --> 01:03:12,459
- What did you do to your foot?
- I screwed up.

759
01:03:13,877 --> 01:03:17,464
So, Dad, what do you think
prison will be like?

760
01:03:17,673 --> 01:03:19,800
Tommy.

761
01:03:20,008 --> 01:03:24,388
The paper said Utah's favoured by two.
He probably won't even have to go.

762
01:03:24,596 --> 01:03:26,390
Can we not talk about sports?

763
01:03:26,598 --> 01:03:30,102
I just want to spend some time
with you guys, before I...

764
01:03:32,604 --> 01:03:35,190
You know.

765
01:03:37,609 --> 01:03:41,155
Wow. That's good.

766
01:03:42,906 --> 01:03:46,577
- How's work?
- Fine.

767
01:03:46,785 --> 01:03:51,582
How's your friend...Jill?

768
01:03:52,791 --> 01:03:57,880
Jill moved to Rhode Island
two years ago.

769
01:03:58,797 --> 01:04:02,092
I didn't mean Jill, I meant Donna.

770
01:04:03,677 --> 01:04:06,180
Di...ane.

771
01:04:08,557 --> 01:04:11,101
- You don't have to do this.
- I want to.

772
01:04:11,310 --> 01:04:17,232
- How's old Diane?
- Her boy's turning eight on Sunday.

773
01:04:17,441 --> 01:04:22,070
But, well,
I'm sure you wouldn't want to go.

774
01:04:23,155 --> 01:04:26,742
There's nothing I'd rather do

775
01:04:27,659 --> 01:04:30,954
on God's green earth

776
01:04:31,205 --> 01:04:35,834
than go to that little bastard's
birthday party.

777
01:04:36,043 --> 01:04:38,921
But I'll be in lock-up.

778
01:04:39,129 --> 01:04:42,758
Grandma, I've done
something terribly wrong.

779
01:04:42,966 --> 01:04:47,179
I might have to go to jail and
become some bad man's boyfriend.

780
01:04:47,387 --> 01:04:53,519
That's nice, Peanut. Now could you get
me a grapefruit out of the fridge?

781
01:04:57,940 --> 01:05:02,236
- Here we go, Celtics.
- Here we go!

782
01:05:02,444 --> 01:05:04,863
Excuse me.

783
01:05:09,910 --> 01:05:13,247
- Here we go, Celtics!
- Hey, Jimmy!

784
01:05:13,455 --> 01:05:15,332
Mikey!

785
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,254
Game 7! We're going all the way!

786
01:05:20,462 --> 01:05:24,842
- Root for Utah. This is a nightmare.
- I think I'm going to throw up.

787
01:05:31,265 --> 01:05:34,268
I think I need a hug
with my hot dog today.

788
01:05:36,061 --> 01:05:40,023
-Jimmy, how could you?
- Baby, let me explain.

789
01:05:40,232 --> 01:05:43,110
- What's the deal with the jerseys?
- Yeah!

790
01:05:44,987 --> 01:05:48,365
- Isn't it obvious?
- No!

791
01:05:52,578 --> 01:05:57,457
The Celtics have lost
the last two games, right?

792
01:05:57,666 --> 01:06:02,713
- And who have we been rooting for?
- The Celtics!

793
01:06:02,921 --> 01:06:07,509
So can't you see?
We are the bad luck guys!

794
01:06:07,718 --> 01:06:10,888
It wasn't Chris McCarthy!
It was us!

795
01:06:11,096 --> 01:06:17,394
So now, when we root for the Jazz,
we're going to jinx them!

796
01:06:17,603 --> 01:06:19,438
The Celtics are going to win!

797
01:06:24,610 --> 01:06:28,405
Here we go, here we go, here we go.

798
01:06:28,614 --> 01:06:31,950
Thanks, Suzy.
You pulled that out of your butt.

799
01:06:32,159 --> 01:06:37,372
I didn't want to say anything,
but I knew it was you two. Good idea!

800
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,211
"Well, it all comes down to this.":

801
01:06:42,419 --> 01:06:46,924
The final game of the NBA finals.
In case you've been out of the country,

802
01:06:47,132 --> 01:06:51,762
the talk is that nobody has seen
or heard from Lewis Scott.

803
01:06:51,970 --> 01:06:55,474
- Where the hell is he?
- Listen up! He's not coming.

804
01:06:55,682 --> 01:07:00,771
We're going to do this without him.
Utah Jazz is not Lewis Scott.

805
01:07:00,979 --> 01:07:06,860
There is nothing you guys can't do!
I believe in you. Believe in yourselves.

806
01:07:07,069 --> 01:07:12,950
Lurch, stand under the basket.
Just sit there and rebound, right?

807
01:07:13,242 --> 01:07:15,494
But I got the good stuff!

808
01:07:15,702 --> 01:07:19,164
I don't want to hear
the Croatian stuff!

809
01:07:19,373 --> 01:07:24,002
Just sit under the basket and rebound.
Can you do that much?

810
01:07:24,211 --> 01:07:28,632
I swear, if you take the ball
and shoot, I'll get you deported!

811
01:07:28,841 --> 01:07:34,137
- Where the hell do you think he is?
- Maybe he had trouble with the van.

812
01:07:34,346 --> 01:07:37,933
What's happening, gentlemen?
Good to see you again.

813
01:07:38,142 --> 01:07:39,476
Hey, Kevin.

814
01:07:39,685 --> 01:07:43,689
What's with the jerseys? Don't you think
that's a little overkill?

815
01:07:43,897 --> 01:07:47,860
- He escaped.
- No frigging way!

816
01:07:48,068 --> 01:07:50,737
You didn't bet on the Celtics?

817
01:07:50,946 --> 01:07:55,033
- Worse. Look at this.
- You bought a T-shirt?

818
01:07:55,242 --> 01:08:00,581
No, I had 20,000 of these made up.
If they lose, they're worthless.

819
01:08:02,124 --> 01:08:05,919
- It's a nice design.
- You idiots.

820
01:08:06,128 --> 01:08:11,300
You better hope and pray the Celtics
win, or you're writing a big cheque.

821
01:08:11,508 --> 01:08:13,468
This isn't bad.

822
01:08:13,677 --> 01:08:17,306
It could be worth something later,
in a few years,

823
01:08:17,514 --> 01:08:21,268
because it represents an event
that might not happen.

824
01:08:21,477 --> 01:08:26,523
<i>At centre, in his
second big year from Croatia,</i>

825
01:08:26,732 --> 01:08:31,236
<i>at seven feet tall, number 7 1,</i>

826
01:08:31,445 --> 01:08:35,032
<i>Ilja "Lurch"Bronfermakher!</i>

827
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:40,579
- They love me, they really love me!
- They cheer because Lewis isn't here.

828
01:08:40,787 --> 01:08:43,832
- They're going to win.
- Why must you ruin this for me?

829
01:08:44,041 --> 01:08:47,252
<i>..your fabulous Boston Celtics.</i>

830
01:08:47,461 --> 01:08:51,715
<i>At guard, at six foot three,
number 1 1...</i>

831
01:08:59,681 --> 01:09:03,143
Lewis!

832
01:09:03,352 --> 01:09:06,897
- Looking good!
- Looking very rested! Go, Jazz!

833
01:09:10,567 --> 01:09:13,445
- Sorry, Coach.
- Lewis is here. Lewis!

834
01:09:13,654 --> 01:09:19,368
Hi. This is the 7th game. Do you have
any idea what you put us through?

835
01:09:19,576 --> 01:09:23,914
- Coach, You're not...
- What the hell's the matter with you?

836
01:09:24,122 --> 01:09:28,919
Why do you do this? You're selfish.
That kind of behaviour is inexcusable!

837
01:09:29,127 --> 01:09:32,840
I'm going to sit your ass
on the bench. I'm benching you!

838
01:09:33,048 --> 01:09:37,010
- You can't bench me.
- You're benched! Sit down!

839
01:09:39,179 --> 01:09:41,890
Bring it in. Huddle up, boys.

840
01:09:43,392 --> 01:09:45,769
Kimball, jeez.

841
01:09:45,978 --> 01:09:50,232
- What are you doing? Put him in!
- Messing with me, huh? I saw you.

842
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:54,069
- Kimball, you're blowing it!
- You don't like it, do you?

843
01:09:54,278 --> 01:09:58,699
Doesn't feel good, does it, Lewis?
A little payback for you!

844
01:09:58,907 --> 01:10:04,121
- Kimball! Put your best man in!
- Shut up!

845
01:10:04,329 --> 01:10:07,624
- You shut up!
- Shut up, the both of you!

846
01:10:07,833 --> 01:10:09,668
Shut up!

847
01:10:12,754 --> 01:10:14,756
Shut up!

848
01:10:16,925 --> 01:10:22,014
All right, you suffered long enough.
Get in there. Let's win this one!

849
01:10:22,222 --> 01:10:24,183
- Go, Lewis!
- Scott power!

850
01:10:25,017 --> 01:10:28,437
Sometimes you just gotta
be tough with these guys.

851
01:10:28,645 --> 01:10:31,982
Lurch, come here.

852
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:35,694
- Put your good stuff on the bench.
- I feel you, Coach.

853
01:10:35,903 --> 01:10:38,238
Feel the bench, all right.

854
01:10:38,447 --> 01:10:43,410
Yellow, purple, green and white,
the Jazz are gonna win tonight!

855
01:10:58,467 --> 01:11:00,219
Yeah, Lewis!

856
01:11:03,347 --> 01:11:09,061
Scott can't find his rhythm.
That's the price for skipping practice.

857
01:11:09,269 --> 01:11:12,022
It's coming back to haunt him.

858
01:11:12,231 --> 01:11:18,278
- Yeah, Lewis. Go get 'em.
-Jazz, Jazz, Jazz.

859
01:11:25,118 --> 01:11:29,706
You guys are truly devoted. There
must be green blood in your veins.

860
01:11:36,380 --> 01:11:41,510
Celtics are playing a physical brand
of ball. They're beating up the Jazz.

861
01:11:46,056 --> 01:11:51,478
Prison won't be so bad.
I can become a born-again Christian.

862
01:11:51,687 --> 01:11:56,233
That'll be good. Nobody wants
a born-again Christian as their bitch.

863
01:11:57,317 --> 01:11:59,444
Yes!

864
01:12:00,779 --> 01:12:03,991
-Jesus loves you.
- Move your ass.

865
01:12:04,199 --> 01:12:07,244
- I'm trying to spread the gospel.
- Spread this:

866
01:12:07,452 --> 01:12:10,414
Thou shalt not ruin
the friggin' game for me!

867
01:12:24,678 --> 01:12:27,556
You stupid son of a bitch. Nice form.

868
01:12:28,849 --> 01:12:34,313
<i>1 5 minutes half-time period.
Please pull out your ticket stubs!</i>

869
01:12:34,521 --> 01:12:40,486
<i>If you're sitting in row 3,
seat 6, you've been chosen for...</i>

870
01:12:40,694 --> 01:12:44,239
- That's me.
- Holy shit! It's Jimmy!

871
01:12:45,532 --> 01:12:49,912
- I can't do it. Not like this.
- We might need the bail money.

872
01:12:53,081 --> 01:12:56,335
I'm Bob Cousy...

873
01:12:56,543 --> 01:13:03,091
You've got to do it! Listen, listen!
How long have we been coming here?

874
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:06,887
- Since we were nine.
- It all comes down to this!

875
01:13:07,095 --> 01:13:12,100
He lives right down the street.
He's a plumber from Charlestown.

876
01:13:12,309 --> 01:13:17,773
You actually get to play
in the Garden! At the finals!

877
01:13:17,981 --> 01:13:24,196
In a couple of weeks, this place is
rubble. Jimmy, this is your destiny!

878
01:13:25,405 --> 01:13:27,324
Thank you.

879
01:13:33,121 --> 01:13:38,043
Please give a big hand
to Jimmy Flaherty!

880
01:13:45,050 --> 01:13:48,971
- Mr Cousy, don't steal the ball.
- Take your best shot.

881
01:13:49,179 --> 01:13:53,475
- I don't want you to take it from me.
- Do it for Bean Town, baby!

882
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:00,941
Do it! Destiny!

883
01:14:19,501 --> 01:14:21,712
You did it! You did it!

884
01:14:27,050 --> 01:14:29,094
Get the money!

885
01:14:36,894 --> 01:14:41,565
Mickey, 1 00,000 bucks can buy us
a pretty good lawyer!

886
01:14:41,773 --> 01:14:44,109
It's over.

887
01:14:44,318 --> 01:14:48,572
Scott's never going to wake up.
We may as well turn ourselves in now.

888
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:52,326
Be quiet.
I'm tired of your negativity.

889
01:14:52,534 --> 01:14:54,912
We're going to jail!

890
01:14:57,831 --> 01:15:01,293
No, we're not going to jail.
I'm going to jail, alone.

891
01:15:01,502 --> 01:15:05,714
I'm going to say
that I kidnapped Scott.

892
01:15:05,923 --> 01:15:10,177
- What are you saying?
- You have a wife and a kid.

893
01:15:10,385 --> 01:15:14,848
If somebody gets caught,
it's going to be me. I'll take the fall.

894
01:15:16,767 --> 01:15:20,938
No way. If we get caught,
we're going down together.

895
01:15:21,146 --> 01:15:25,108
Somebody's got to spot you when
you're lifting weights in the yard.

896
01:15:27,528 --> 01:15:34,535
Heading into the 2nd half, the Celtics
leading a listless Utah Jazz 52 to 38,

897
01:15:34,743 --> 01:15:37,913
Lewis Scott,
only 6 points in the first half.

898
01:15:38,121 --> 01:15:43,877
<i>If Scott doesn't wake up and start
getting some really big numbers,</i>

899
01:15:44,086 --> 01:15:46,713
<i>there's no way
Utah can win this game.</i>

900
01:15:46,922 --> 01:15:49,925
Defence, defence!

901
01:15:52,511 --> 01:15:54,054
Oh, God!

902
01:15:56,348 --> 01:16:00,602
<i>Kirby, two points!
Benton, two points!</i>

903
01:16:06,358 --> 01:16:08,986
OK. Come on,
Lewis, you pansy, let's go!

904
01:16:09,194 --> 01:16:12,489
<i>It looks like
it's all Celtics here tonight.</i>

905
01:16:14,074 --> 01:16:15,659
God!

906
01:16:18,162 --> 01:16:23,500
Scott! Listen to me!
I will not be ignored!

907
01:16:23,709 --> 01:16:27,004
Everybody knows
you're going to shoot the damn ball!

908
01:16:27,212 --> 01:16:32,509
Surprise them. Pass it!
You are not taking me down with you!

909
01:16:39,183 --> 01:16:43,687
All right, come on.
Pass it, you asshole!

910
01:16:48,442 --> 01:16:51,612
Sheppard!
Sheppard! Are you OK, man?

911
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:56,492
- What happened?
- I think Lewis passed you the ball.

912
01:16:56,700 --> 01:16:59,203
He passed me the ball?

913
01:16:59,411 --> 01:17:03,373
Lewis passes the ball! The only man
more surprised than me was Sheppard.

914
01:17:03,582 --> 01:17:09,463
- He took a nasty cut to the ear.
- Next time he'll wear an ear guard.

915
01:17:11,048 --> 01:17:13,175
Good pass!

916
01:17:14,259 --> 01:17:17,012
Kimball has finally gotten
through to his star guard.

917
01:17:17,221 --> 01:17:24,812
No, that's us! Marv Albert's
talking about us. Oh, I can die now!

918
01:17:26,772 --> 01:17:29,650
Get up the floor, baby! All the way!

919
01:17:29,858 --> 01:17:33,445
Yes! Good pass, Lewis!
Good pass.

920
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:42,162
That's basketball. You see a problem,
you solve it. That's coaching.

921
01:17:44,790 --> 01:17:48,293
- Good pass!
- Way to go!

922
01:17:48,502 --> 01:17:53,173
- Kick their butt, baby?
- Are you really rooting for Utah?

923
01:17:53,382 --> 01:17:57,636
No, of course not.
I just don't want to go to jail.

924
01:17:57,845 --> 01:18:01,557
Yeah. We got no choice.
Go, Scott!

925
01:18:01,765 --> 01:18:05,853
- You're beautiful!
- Back on "D"!

926
01:18:06,061 --> 01:18:07,688
Nice pass.

927
01:18:07,896 --> 01:18:12,151
Lewis Scott has expanded his game,
and his team-mates are responding.

928
01:18:21,285 --> 01:18:26,039
- What's wrong with them?
- I think their plan is backfiring.

929
01:18:26,248 --> 01:18:28,417
There it is, there it is,
Scott, hoop!

930
01:18:28,625 --> 01:18:32,462
There it is, there it is, there it is,
Scott, hoop!

931
01:18:41,472 --> 01:18:44,892
- Get that prick out!
- Foul him! I want him dead!

932
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:49,188
- Easy! Show some respect.
- Patty, Timmy. Respect!

933
01:19:02,284 --> 01:19:08,373
- Shep, you all right?
- I think your pass messed me up.

934
01:19:08,582 --> 01:19:13,170
- Let's go! Tape up! Play hard!
- He's hurt, man!

935
01:19:16,089 --> 01:19:19,510
Lurch. You're going in.

936
01:19:19,718 --> 01:19:25,224
I will not let you down. I'll give them
some of that death row shit.

937
01:19:25,432 --> 01:19:29,895
Don't worry about the death row shit.
Just don't embarrass me.

938
01:19:30,103 --> 01:19:31,772
Lurch! Check in.

939
01:19:31,980 --> 01:19:35,943
Right. That would've been a technical.

940
01:19:48,747 --> 01:19:51,375
Got 'em!

941
01:19:51,583 --> 01:19:55,337
Two. Six. One shot.

942
01:19:57,130 --> 01:20:00,467
I can't take it any more.

943
01:20:02,010 --> 01:20:07,224
I am totally losing my shit, man.
I'll never make it in jail!

944
01:20:07,432 --> 01:20:12,437
I'm the kind of guy who hangs himself
in his shoelaces on the first night!

945
01:20:12,646 --> 01:20:15,357
Don't do it! Don't do it, Jimmy!

946
01:20:15,566 --> 01:20:22,698
<i>Play that funky music, white boy
Play that funky music now</i>

947
01:20:22,906 --> 01:20:29,538
The fate of the Jazz rests on the
shoulders of their star, Lewis Scott.

948
01:20:29,746 --> 01:20:32,082
All net!

949
01:20:34,918 --> 01:20:36,712
All right, go!

950
01:20:41,550 --> 01:20:43,594
- What happened?
- Keep singing!

951
01:20:43,802 --> 01:20:48,515
<i>Chaka Khan, Chaka Khan
Chaka Khan, Chaka Khan</i>

952
01:20:56,106 --> 01:20:57,858
Great play!

953
01:21:00,819 --> 01:21:02,196
Come on.

954
01:21:14,082 --> 01:21:16,877
- Our ball.
- The ball, please.

955
01:21:18,253 --> 01:21:22,007
Jimmy, it's a time-out!
Utah's down by one.

956
01:21:22,216 --> 01:21:26,303
There's 7.5 seconds left.
Utah's got the ball.

957
01:21:26,512 --> 01:21:32,059
If Utah wins, we don't go to jail.
If they miss it, the Celtics win.

958
01:21:32,267 --> 01:21:37,272
I don't know what to do.
I'm so confused. Who do I root for?

959
01:21:38,732 --> 01:21:41,360
Root for Utah!

960
01:21:41,568 --> 01:21:45,572
All right. We've got 7.5 seconds.
That's a lot of time.

961
01:21:45,781 --> 01:21:50,536
Just suck up the energy.
All right. Listen up.

962
01:21:50,744 --> 01:21:54,164
We move the ball.
Lewis gets here, passes to Dale...

963
01:22:02,631 --> 01:22:08,345
- Is that clear? Are you with me?
- Money in the bank, Coach.

964
01:22:08,554 --> 01:22:13,392
Get in there. Seize the championship.
We've got seven seconds.

965
01:22:14,518 --> 01:22:20,274
Nobody sends my man to jail.
Let's go. Come on, you asshole.

966
01:22:21,567 --> 01:22:25,654
- Come on, Lewis!
- Lewis!

967
01:22:33,370 --> 01:22:35,789
Defence, defence!

968
01:22:49,219 --> 01:22:53,474
Go! Now!

969
01:23:12,826 --> 01:23:16,246
We won! He listened to you, Mikey!

970
01:23:17,414 --> 01:23:20,167
We're free!

971
01:23:23,712 --> 01:23:28,592
- We did it!
- I love this game!

972
01:23:28,801 --> 01:23:34,556
It would not have happened if Scott
had not changed his style of play.

973
01:23:43,607 --> 01:23:50,572
Hey, man.Jazz, world champions!
Don't leave me hanging, man!

974
01:23:56,745 --> 01:23:58,872
Kevin O'Grady, Boston Police.

975
01:23:59,081 --> 01:24:02,626
I have reason to believe these
two men have perpetrated a crime.

976
01:24:02,835 --> 01:24:06,380
- What's your relationship to them?
- I know these two jerks.

977
01:24:10,551 --> 01:24:13,720
They're my friends.

978
01:24:22,354 --> 01:24:25,482
- Who's the best in the NBA?
- You are!

979
01:24:25,691 --> 01:24:28,652
But we'll kick your ass next year!

980
01:24:28,861 --> 01:24:33,407
I'm sorry about the abduction.
I've never done that to another guy.

981
01:24:33,615 --> 01:24:36,326
Lewis, Lewis...

982
01:24:46,170 --> 01:24:49,173
I don't know about this, Jimmy.

983
01:24:49,381 --> 01:24:54,678
Carol and I are really getting along.
She even went to a hockey game.

984
01:24:54,887 --> 01:24:57,473
If she thinks
I didn't learn my lesson...

985
01:24:57,681 --> 01:25:00,851
But you did, Mikey!
You did learn your lesson.

986
01:25:01,059 --> 01:25:07,524
You will not interfere with
an NBA championship again. Never!

987
01:25:10,277 --> 01:25:13,489
This is different.

988
01:25:19,036 --> 01:25:22,372
You're right. This is different.

989
01:25:22,581 --> 01:25:26,084
- This is football season.
- Yeah.

990
01:25:30,172 --> 01:25:34,301
- What's going on?
- Hello there, Mr Deion Sanders.

991
01:25:34,510 --> 01:25:37,054
It's your 3 a.m. wake-up call.

992
01:25:37,262 --> 01:25:40,015
You autograph hounds are
out of control.

993
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:45,687
Oh, we don't want your autograph.
No.

994
01:25:45,813 --> 01:25:47,981
What do you want?
