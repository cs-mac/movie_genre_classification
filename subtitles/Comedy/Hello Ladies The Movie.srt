1
00:00:00,941 --> 00:00:02,718
We listen to your concerns. 

2
00:00:02,718 --> 00:00:05,656
National counseling session! 

3
00:00:08,761 --> 00:00:13,9
We have four very charming singers today. 

4
00:00:13,10 --> 00:00:15,431
The gentle guy of SHINHWA is back solo. 

5
00:00:15,431 --> 00:00:17,294
Shin Hyesung! 

6
00:00:19,247 --> 00:00:21,272
K.Will! 

7
00:00:23,196 --> 00:00:25,341
Heo Youngji! 

8
00:00:25,341 --> 00:00:27,178
Ryeowook! 

9
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:30,419
What a great combination today. 

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,190
We met today. Our hair is the same color. 

11
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:36,669
It makes you look like brothers. 

12
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:37,860
You look like brothers from here. 

13
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,853
I'd be a failure if we were brothers. 

14
00:00:41,425 --> 00:00:43,748
Your parents must be different. 

15
00:00:43,748 --> 00:00:45,509
What are you talking about? 

16
00:00:45,509 --> 00:00:48,358
How long has it been since SHINHWA debuted? 

17
00:00:48,358 --> 00:00:50,772
This is our 18th anniversary. 

18
00:00:51,562 --> 00:00:54,32
I was asked this question when I was twenty-one. 

19
00:00:54,32 --> 00:00:56,388
Where will SHINHWA be in 10 years? 

20
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:59,734
I said everyone would be over thirty, 

21
00:00:59,734 --> 00:01:01,838
so we wouldn't be dancing singers. 

22
00:01:01,838 --> 00:01:07,352
I seriously said we would probably all be dads. 

23
00:01:07,352 --> 00:01:08,772
Nobody is a dad. 

24
00:01:08,772 --> 00:01:10,177
Right. Nobody is married yet. 

25
00:01:10,177 --> 00:01:13,14
Yes, officially there aren't any dads. 

26
00:01:15,33 --> 00:01:16,461
(Why are you doing this to me?) 

27
00:01:16,461 --> 00:01:19,91
Your album is a dance song. 

28
00:01:19,91 --> 00:01:23,735
It's the 10th anniversary album for my solo debut. 

29
00:01:23,735 --> 00:01:25,487
I wanted to try something special. 

30
00:01:25,487 --> 00:01:27,476
What is the key choreography? 

31
00:01:27,932 --> 00:01:29,817
A flower dance. 

32
00:01:29,817 --> 00:01:31,592
Show us. 

33
00:01:33,653 --> 00:01:38,730
Without looking at the camera, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 

34
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:39,880
When your hands go down… 

35
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,000
Look at the camera. 

36
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,698
That's how it goes. 

37
00:01:43,698 --> 00:01:45,985
Sing for us. We'll dance along. 

38
00:01:47,22 --> 00:01:49,771
(Cute in a way / Somewhat sexy flower) 

39
00:01:49,771 --> 00:01:52,75
(Cute and pretty flower / Uncomfortable flower) 

40
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,359
Isn't it easy? 

41
00:01:54,633 --> 00:01:56,585
What's with this response? 

42
00:01:56,585 --> 00:01:57,958
K.Will, try it. 

43
00:01:57,958 --> 00:01:59,901
(Brother, save the flower dance) 

44
00:02:00,806 --> 00:02:02,301
(Don't worry) 

45
00:02:02,949 --> 00:02:04,939
Magician. 

46
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:06,951
(I'm your brother) 

47
00:02:07,747 --> 00:02:09,90
(Good job) 

48
00:02:09,90 --> 00:02:12,742
His eyes look charming in the end. 

49
00:02:12,742 --> 00:02:14,403
- Thank you. / - It's like a flower blossomed. 

50
00:02:14,403 --> 00:02:16,11
K.Will just did it, 

51
00:02:16,11 --> 00:02:18,315
but she's talking about Hyesung. 

52
00:02:18,315 --> 00:02:20,620
(K.Will didn't exist to Youngji!) 

53
00:02:21,111 --> 00:02:23,96
Super Junior was formed over 10 years ago, too. 

54
00:02:23,97 --> 00:02:24,837
It's been 11 years. 

55
00:02:24,837 --> 00:02:26,182
This is your 11th year. 

56
00:02:26,182 --> 00:02:29,422
Your new song is "The Little Prince". 

57
00:02:29,422 --> 00:02:31,873
Show us a bit. 

58
00:02:33,493 --> 00:02:37,122
(Attracting interest with the flower dance) 

59
00:02:38,529 --> 00:02:39,945
(How cute) 

60
00:02:43,273 --> 00:02:46,601
(A sweet voice that isn't mischievous) 

61
00:02:49,145 --> 00:02:52,812
(It makes your heart melt) 

62
00:02:52,812 --> 00:02:53,836
Nice. 

63
00:02:53,836 --> 00:02:56,148
Youngji, you imitated Hwang Jungeum before. 

64
00:02:56,148 --> 00:02:56,998
Yes. 

65
00:02:56,998 --> 00:02:58,566
It was really good. 

66
00:02:58,566 --> 00:03:02,94
There's a scene from "She Was Pretty" 

67
00:03:02,94 --> 00:03:04,168
where Jungeum really panics. 

68
00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:07,178
Oh! Oh! That's nonsense. 

69
00:03:07,178 --> 00:03:10,750
Oh! Oh! Gee! That's absurd! 

70
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,2
It's really absurd! 

71
00:03:13,973 --> 00:03:15,700
You're good. 

72
00:03:16,312 --> 00:03:18,769
Do you have any concerns? 

73
00:03:18,769 --> 00:03:21,873
I'm thirty. 

74
00:03:21,873 --> 00:03:23,928
I'm into eel juice. 

75
00:03:23,928 --> 00:03:25,801
- Eel juice? / - Yes. 

76
00:03:25,801 --> 00:03:26,501
Why? 

77
00:03:26,502 --> 00:03:32,744
I used to jump right up in the morning before. 

78
00:03:32,744 --> 00:03:35,122
- What? / - You're tired? 

79
00:03:35,122 --> 00:03:39,239
I'm on my second pack now. I jump right up. 

80
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:40,683
What? 

81
00:03:43,262 --> 00:03:45,118
(My energy shoots up) 

82
00:03:46,2 --> 00:03:48,759
My married daughter keeps calling me. 

83
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:49,872
She said she couldn't sleep because 

84
00:03:49,872 --> 00:03:51,12
the baby cried all night. 

85
00:03:51,12 --> 00:03:52,860
She had to sleep because she was tired. 

86
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:56,524
He doesn't help. He doesn't even do the dishes. 

87
00:03:56,524 --> 00:03:58,376
They take me with them when 

88
00:03:58,376 --> 00:03:59,744
they go to the dry sauna. 

89
00:03:59,744 --> 00:04:00,552
You watch the baby at the dry sauna? 

90
00:04:00,552 --> 00:04:02,299
Didn't you think about being independent? 

91
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:03,937
I don't intend to. 

92
00:04:03,937 --> 00:04:07,851
Until the children go to middle school. 

93
00:04:07,851 --> 00:04:10,527
Did your daughter change after the show? 

94
00:04:10,527 --> 00:04:12,15
My husband scolded her a lot. 

95
00:04:12,15 --> 00:04:13,572
- He did? / - Yes. 

96
00:04:13,573 --> 00:04:16,53
She didn't call for a whole week. 

97
00:04:16,53 --> 00:04:17,240
Really? A whole week? 

98
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,640
She said she was having a hard time 

99
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,469
in the family chat room. 

100
00:04:23,34 --> 00:04:27,94
"I'm tired. I took the young one to daycare" 

101
00:04:27,94 --> 00:04:28,623
"and went to the hospital with the other." 

102
00:04:28,624 --> 00:04:30,348
"She's lying around sick." 

103
00:04:31,311 --> 00:04:32,589
She keeps complaining. 

104
00:04:32,589 --> 00:04:35,193
I took the child to the hospital by myself. 

105
00:04:35,193 --> 00:04:37,842
Mom always makes an appointment. 

106
00:04:37,843 --> 00:04:38,639
It was tough because she didn't. 

107
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,81
Everyone lives like that. 

108
00:04:40,81 --> 00:04:42,337
Who is watching the kids today? 

109
00:04:42,337 --> 00:04:43,221
My husband. 

110
00:04:43,221 --> 00:04:44,610
He changed a lot, too, huh? 

111
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:45,849
He really changed a lot. 

112
00:04:45,849 --> 00:04:49,104
He put both of them to bed after work. 

113
00:04:49,105 --> 00:04:50,686
Wow. 

114
00:04:50,686 --> 00:04:53,626
Let's see if she wins a second time. 

115
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:54,462
What about the winner? 

116
00:04:54,463 --> 00:04:56,425
The winner receives a prize worth $1,000. 

117
00:04:56,425 --> 00:05:00,209
Show us what today's concerns are. 

118
00:05:00,945 --> 00:05:02,379
'I'm Going to Burst'. 

119
00:05:02,379 --> 00:05:03,779
That sounds a bit embarrassing. 

120
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:04,979
It must be Dongyeop's. 

121
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:06,450
Yes. 

122
00:05:07,803 --> 00:05:09,996
This woman gets really mad 

123
00:05:09,996 --> 00:05:13,991
all day because of a man. 

124
00:05:13,992 --> 00:05:15,3
Hello, 

125
00:05:15,3 --> 00:05:17,756
I'm a housewife of 6 years with two children. 

126
00:05:17,756 --> 00:05:20,407
I first met my husband at work 10 years ago. 

127
00:05:20,408 --> 00:05:23,640
I thought he was always calm and full of leisure. 

128
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:28,104
I well for that and chased him around for 3 years. 

129
00:05:28,105 --> 00:05:30,153
We ended up getting married. 

130
00:05:30,153 --> 00:05:31,57
She courted him? 

131
00:05:31,57 --> 00:05:31,925
Yes. 

132
00:05:31,925 --> 00:05:35,681
I must have been crazy. 

133
00:05:35,681 --> 00:05:37,561
I dug my own grave. 

134
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,738
Honey, where are you? 

135
00:05:40,738 --> 00:05:42,802
I made your favorite. Bean paste stew. 

136
00:05:42,802 --> 00:05:46,194
"I'm almost there. I'm right outside." 

137
00:05:47,169 --> 00:05:48,930
I thought you were right outside. 

138
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,937
It's been 20 minutes. 

139
00:05:50,937 --> 00:05:53,444
"I'm outside the door." 

140
00:05:54,663 --> 00:05:55,823
Did he run into someone? 

141
00:05:55,823 --> 00:05:58,270
Are you kidding? You said you were 

142
00:05:58,271 --> 00:05:59,306
outside the door! 

143
00:05:59,306 --> 00:06:02,311
"I'm coming in." 

144
00:06:02,311 --> 00:06:08,659
He's so slow. It takes him 30 minutes 

145
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:10,533
to park the car right in front and come in. 

146
00:06:10,533 --> 00:06:12,105
(Why?) 

147
00:06:12,732 --> 00:06:14,121
(No way) 

148
00:06:14,121 --> 00:06:16,342
When there's an important family gathering… 

149
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:19,123
Honey, dad is asking for you. Where are you? 

150
00:06:19,123 --> 00:06:20,692
"I'll be right there." 

151
00:06:22,283 --> 00:06:25,251
"The party is almost over. Where are you?" 

152
00:06:25,655 --> 00:06:28,914
"Father, I'm right outside." 

153
00:06:28,914 --> 00:06:29,782
He said he was right outside, 

154
00:06:29,782 --> 00:06:33,133
but he was 2 hours late. 

155
00:06:33,134 --> 00:06:36,269
When I gave birth… 

156
00:06:36,269 --> 00:06:38,322
Honey, the baby is coming. 

157
00:06:38,322 --> 00:06:39,703
I have to get to the hospital! 

158
00:06:39,703 --> 00:06:41,527
"What? Okay!" 

159
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:43,767
"Let me get my socks on first." 

160
00:06:45,442 --> 00:06:46,928
He should just run out. 

161
00:06:46,928 --> 00:06:49,107
What are you doing? The baby is coming! 

162
00:06:49,107 --> 00:06:53,712
"Okay, don't worry. Where's my watch?" 

163
00:06:53,712 --> 00:06:58,673
He is full of leisure in any urgent situation. 

164
00:06:58,673 --> 00:07:00,85
That's frustrating. 

165
00:07:00,85 --> 00:07:01,200
Is he crazy? 

166
00:07:01,201 --> 00:07:04,156
I'm going to burst from anger. 

167
00:07:04,156 --> 00:07:08,257
What will I do with this slow man? 

168
00:07:12,20 --> 00:07:16,222
I thought I'd have enough time to wash up 

169
00:07:16,222 --> 00:07:18,882
and get ready in an hour. 

170
00:07:18,882 --> 00:07:19,946
I was lying in bed and thought 

171
00:07:19,946 --> 00:07:24,85
40 minutes should do it. 

172
00:07:25,37 --> 00:07:26,685
(He put off getting up and was late!) 

173
00:07:26,685 --> 00:07:27,487
I always have to take a crap when 

174
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,331
I'm about to go out. 

175
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:31,173
Right. 

176
00:07:31,233 --> 00:07:32,417
(Everyone understands) 

177
00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:35,53
This is serious though. 

178
00:07:35,53 --> 00:07:36,377
How can it take him 30 minutes to go inside? 

179
00:07:36,377 --> 00:07:37,633
I really don't know why. 

180
00:07:37,633 --> 00:07:39,337
Why does it take him 30 minutes in the parking lot? 

181
00:07:39,338 --> 00:07:41,599
I wonder if he was late today. 

182
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,445
Come on out! 

183
00:07:43,446 --> 00:07:45,254
(Who is frustrated because her husband is 

184
00:07:45,254 --> 00:07:47,777
always full of leisure and slow?) 

185
00:07:48,577 --> 00:07:51,236
(Lee Hyemin) 

186
00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:53,974
(Welcome) 

187
00:07:54,302 --> 00:07:56,328
Didn't you know he was like that when you dated? 

188
00:07:56,328 --> 00:07:58,436
You chased him around for 3 years. 

189
00:07:58,437 --> 00:08:00,821
I must have been blinded by love. 

190
00:08:00,821 --> 00:08:02,528
He looked leisurely and calm. 

191
00:08:02,528 --> 00:08:03,381
That's how you saw him. 

192
00:08:03,381 --> 00:08:05,669
Yes, he seemed mature. 

193
00:08:06,417 --> 00:08:09,301
You wanted to void the marriage? 

194
00:08:09,301 --> 00:08:11,289
The wedding day… 

195
00:08:11,289 --> 00:08:12,748
Was he late? 

196
00:08:12,748 --> 00:08:16,56
He took his time. The wedding was at 12:30. 

197
00:08:16,56 --> 00:08:19,8
We arrived 10 minutes before the wedding. 

198
00:08:19,8 --> 00:08:19,909
- What? / - The groom? 

199
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:21,236
Yes. 

200
00:08:21,237 --> 00:08:22,761
The guests greeted us. 

201
00:08:22,761 --> 00:08:24,584
Sure. The guests arrive early. 

202
00:08:24,584 --> 00:08:26,79
That was bad. 

203
00:08:26,79 --> 00:08:29,457
We don't have any pictures with the guests. 

204
00:08:29,457 --> 00:08:31,109
In the waiting room. 

205
00:08:31,109 --> 00:08:32,175
(It's only once in a lifetime) 

206
00:08:32,798 --> 00:08:35,677
Is he the procrastinating type or is he just slow? 

207
00:08:35,677 --> 00:08:37,497
Both. 

208
00:08:37,496 --> 00:08:38,732
He's lazy and slow? 

209
00:08:38,732 --> 00:08:39,929
Yes. 

210
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:41,690
When he has to go to the bathroom, 

211
00:08:41,691 --> 00:08:46,486
he sits and glances around. 

212
00:08:46,486 --> 00:08:49,454
He gets up and turns on the light, 

213
00:08:49,454 --> 00:08:51,487
then wonders why he did that. 

214
00:08:51,487 --> 00:08:52,358
He forgot he had to go to the bathroom? 

215
00:08:52,359 --> 00:08:54,698
Yes, it's like a slow motion video. 

216
00:08:54,698 --> 00:08:56,584
He does that when he has to take a crap? 

217
00:08:56,584 --> 00:08:57,483
Yes. 

218
00:08:57,484 --> 00:08:59,800
He's like that in any urgent situation. 

219
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,406
His laziness overcomes natural instincts? 

220
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:04,967
We live on the 1st floor. 

221
00:09:04,967 --> 00:09:06,424
The 1st floor? 

222
00:09:06,424 --> 00:09:07,488
It takes him 30 minutes? 

223
00:09:07,488 --> 00:09:10,41
It takes him 30 minutes to get home 

224
00:09:10,41 --> 00:09:11,410
from the parking lot. 

225
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:13,502
What does he do? 

226
00:09:13,502 --> 00:09:16,165
He just parks and walks in. 

227
00:09:16,165 --> 00:09:17,791
How frustrating. 

228
00:09:18,325 --> 00:09:20,905
Does he walk like this? 

229
00:09:22,384 --> 00:09:23,633
(That must be it) 

230
00:09:23,633 --> 00:09:26,337
How else can it take 30 minutes? 

231
00:09:26,337 --> 00:09:29,216
Stepping on the pavement lines. 

232
00:09:29,216 --> 00:09:30,996
It doesn't make sense. 

233
00:09:32,38 --> 00:09:34,174
The husband. Hello. 

234
00:09:35,197 --> 00:09:37,332
Hello. 

235
00:09:37,961 --> 00:09:40,192
He doesn't look slow. 

236
00:09:40,192 --> 00:09:42,362
He paused a moment while saying hello. 

237
00:09:42,362 --> 00:09:44,933
There was a bit of a buffering. 

238
00:09:44,933 --> 00:09:46,215
Hello. 

239
00:09:47,299 --> 00:09:49,139
Hello. 

240
00:09:49,633 --> 00:09:52,774
I'm really curious. Why does it take 30 minutes? 

241
00:09:52,774 --> 00:09:57,651
Honestly, I walk just like everyone else. 

242
00:09:57,651 --> 00:09:59,988
I don't know why she thinks I'm slow. 

243
00:09:59,988 --> 00:10:02,964
How far is it from the parking lot? 

244
00:10:02,964 --> 00:10:06,958
It feels like it's about 1km. 

245
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:07,688
1km? 

246
00:10:07,688 --> 00:10:11,169
Hey! No parking lot is 1km away! 

247
00:10:11,169 --> 00:10:12,239
It is 1km away? 

248
00:10:12,239 --> 00:10:14,324
No, it's right in front. 

249
00:10:14,324 --> 00:10:18,101
I never thought I was late. 

250
00:10:18,101 --> 00:10:22,164
I don't see how this is a concern. 

251
00:10:22,164 --> 00:10:26,939
I think she's exaggerating a bit. 

252
00:10:28,464 --> 00:10:29,747
(How does he get home from work?) 

253
00:10:30,648 --> 00:10:33,871
(This is the apartment CCTV) 

254
00:10:33,871 --> 00:10:35,581
(Their house) 

255
00:10:36,429 --> 00:10:38,732
(He takes his time and slowly goes home) 

256
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:47,271
(It looks like there's something stuck on his shoe) 

257
00:10:50,253 --> 00:10:51,668
(Get off!) 

258
00:11:00,152 --> 00:11:02,136
(He turns around) 

259
00:11:04,945 --> 00:11:07,724
(He looks in the mirror) 

260
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,492
(He checks his phone) 

261
00:11:18,956 --> 00:11:20,796
(He finally presses the keypad for the door lock) 

262
00:11:23,893 --> 00:11:26,449
(It sure is hard to get home) 

263
00:11:28,493 --> 00:11:32,642
The production staff said he was slow at 

264
00:11:32,642 --> 00:11:34,656
folding the laundry, too. 

265
00:11:34,656 --> 00:11:36,767
Let's see how slow he is. 

266
00:11:37,533 --> 00:11:38,836
Come on out. 

267
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:41,627
Give us laundry. 

268
00:11:42,111 --> 00:11:42,914
He doesn't get up right away. 

269
00:11:42,914 --> 00:11:44,175
Come on out! 

270
00:11:44,947 --> 00:11:46,655
He has a nice build. 

271
00:11:46,655 --> 00:11:48,206
He walks slowly. 

272
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:50,910
(It's already frustrating) 

273
00:11:51,522 --> 00:11:52,818
Fold it. 

274
00:11:53,343 --> 00:11:55,69
Like you always do. 

275
00:11:55,70 --> 00:11:56,535
(Here!) 

276
00:11:57,711 --> 00:11:59,946
(Like he folds laundry at home) 

277
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,219
(It's natural) 

278
00:12:02,219 --> 00:12:03,963
Does he help out a lot at home? 

279
00:12:03,963 --> 00:12:05,483
No, he's slow. I just do everything. 

280
00:12:05,483 --> 00:12:06,209
Because it's frustrating? 

281
00:12:06,209 --> 00:12:08,781
You must have asked for help in the beginning. 

282
00:12:08,782 --> 00:12:10,301
I can't watch. I just do it. 

283
00:12:10,301 --> 00:12:14,272
That could be intentional. 

284
00:12:14,272 --> 00:12:16,685
(He just folds it once?) 

285
00:12:17,993 --> 00:12:19,28
(That's it?) 

286
00:12:20,178 --> 00:12:21,167
That's how he folds socks? 

287
00:12:21,167 --> 00:12:22,549
He just folded it in half. 

288
00:12:23,33 --> 00:12:24,697
We have to compare. 

289
00:12:24,697 --> 00:12:26,3
Hyesung, sit next to him and fold. 

290
00:12:26,3 --> 00:12:28,807
We have to see how others do it. 

291
00:12:29,467 --> 00:12:31,186
He's really slow. 

292
00:12:31,186 --> 00:12:33,425
Take socks and… 

293
00:12:33,425 --> 00:12:35,833
- Fold them like this. / - Right. 

294
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:37,899
Like this. 

295
00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:39,347
You're pretty fast, right? 

296
00:12:39,347 --> 00:12:41,260
I'm normal. 

297
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,827
(He folds socks and moves on) 

298
00:12:43,827 --> 00:12:45,434
Hyesung started later. 

299
00:12:46,10 --> 00:12:48,718
Keep folding as you always do. 

300
00:12:48,719 --> 00:12:50,123
You don't have to fold slowly on purpose. 

301
00:12:50,123 --> 00:12:55,676
- Is that how he always folds? / - Yes. 

302
00:12:55,676 --> 00:12:57,54
He folded a shirt like that. 

303
00:12:57,54 --> 00:12:59,156
(Folding in the smallest size?) 

304
00:13:02,671 --> 00:13:04,191
(Did I do something wrong?) 

305
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,991
(He looks this way and that) 

306
00:13:06,991 --> 00:13:09,425
What are you doing? 

307
00:13:09,425 --> 00:13:10,516
(Is it that hard?) 

308
00:13:12,234 --> 00:13:13,759
Is he meticulous? 

309
00:13:14,411 --> 00:13:16,396
He's folding it right though. 

310
00:13:16,397 --> 00:13:20,527
He looks at it and folds it strange. 

311
00:13:21,591 --> 00:13:22,673
Why are you folding it again? 

312
00:13:22,673 --> 00:13:24,253
Nobody folds it like that. 

313
00:13:26,397 --> 00:13:27,784
(Meanwhile Hyesung…) 

314
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:31,46
(He's fast, but…) 

315
00:13:33,469 --> 00:13:35,985
(It seems a bit halfhearted) 

316
00:13:36,705 --> 00:13:38,598
He's folding it a bit strange, too. 

317
00:13:38,598 --> 00:13:41,79
This is how I fold it at home. 

318
00:13:41,80 --> 00:13:43,104
Hyesung's is a mess, too. 

319
00:13:43,104 --> 00:13:44,440
He didn't fold laundry much. 

320
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,941
Hyesung is fast, but not good. 

321
00:13:46,941 --> 00:13:48,702
(Still folding) 

322
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,357
(Neatly in half) 

323
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,271
It's lined up. 

324
00:13:55,272 --> 00:13:56,741
(Unfolding it again?) 

325
00:13:56,741 --> 00:13:58,157
He folded it, then unfolded it and 

326
00:13:58,157 --> 00:14:00,79
lifted it several times. 

327
00:14:00,79 --> 00:14:02,94
Okay, stop. 

328
00:14:02,95 --> 00:14:03,435
He's slow. 

329
00:14:03,435 --> 00:14:04,464
(It's frustrating) 

330
00:14:04,465 --> 00:14:06,756
Try to fold it quickly on purpose. 

331
00:14:06,756 --> 00:14:08,310
Fold it really quickly. 

332
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:09,45
Do it quickly. 

333
00:14:09,45 --> 00:14:11,55
There's no time. Hurry. 

334
00:14:11,55 --> 00:14:12,828
Your life is in danger. 

335
00:14:13,776 --> 00:14:15,762
You'd better fold quickly or else! 

336
00:14:15,762 --> 00:14:17,101
The baby's coming! 

337
00:14:17,101 --> 00:14:18,119
Hurry, hurry! 

338
00:14:18,119 --> 00:14:19,506
The baby's coming! 

339
00:14:21,775 --> 00:14:23,559
Hurry up! 

340
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:25,594
His hands are slow. 

341
00:14:25,856 --> 00:14:27,30
(His hands are too slow!) 

342
00:14:28,57 --> 00:14:29,369
(Ordinary vs. In a rush) 

343
00:14:31,729 --> 00:14:33,993
(2X speed) 

344
00:14:36,605 --> 00:14:39,45
(There's no difference) 

345
00:14:39,953 --> 00:14:41,305
(He returns to his seat) 

346
00:14:42,277 --> 00:14:44,334
Hurry back! 

347
00:14:45,74 --> 00:14:47,109
We have to continue with the recording. 

348
00:14:48,371 --> 00:14:49,361
(Full of leisure) 

349
00:14:50,137 --> 00:14:51,712
Put them back on in your seat! 

350
00:14:53,429 --> 00:14:55,376
(He doesn't rush at all) 

351
00:14:55,776 --> 00:14:59,266
He's not fast, but he seems meticulous. 

352
00:14:59,267 --> 00:15:01,247
Maybe with folding laundry. 

353
00:15:01,247 --> 00:15:05,135
I asked him to replace a socket. 

354
00:15:05,135 --> 00:15:07,819
He said it would be slippery, so he got gloves. 

355
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:08,801
It takes him long to prepare. 

356
00:15:08,801 --> 00:15:13,641
He decided to go with other gloves. 

357
00:15:13,641 --> 00:15:20,636
After he replaced one, he said he was hungry. 

358
00:15:20,636 --> 00:15:23,304
It became night. A day passed like that. 

359
00:15:23,304 --> 00:15:24,520
It took him all day? 

360
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,312
Yes. 

361
00:15:25,312 --> 00:15:26,151
I think he's making excuses because 

362
00:15:26,151 --> 00:15:27,556
he doesn't want to do it. 

363
00:15:27,557 --> 00:15:28,891
Isn't that it? You do that on purpose. 

364
00:15:28,891 --> 00:15:31,99
It seems like a strike. 

365
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:38,527
I'm just meticulous and neat. That's how I am. 

366
00:15:38,527 --> 00:15:40,420
You arrived for your wedding 10 minutes 

367
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,628
before it started. Wasn't that too much? 

368
00:15:41,629 --> 00:15:45,439
I didn't want to look pathetic. 

369
00:15:45,439 --> 00:15:49,742
I tidied up. I was half hour late to the shop. 

370
00:15:49,743 --> 00:15:50,644
From the start? 

371
00:15:50,644 --> 00:15:56,856
A groom should look good in a tuxedo. 

372
00:15:56,856 --> 00:15:59,59
I was about 30 minutes late getting dressed. 

373
00:15:59,59 --> 00:16:00,232
I wasn't able to greet the guests. 

374
00:16:00,232 --> 00:16:02,961
We arrived at 12:20. 

375
00:16:02,961 --> 00:16:05,329
That was wrong, wasn't it? 

376
00:16:05,329 --> 00:16:07,45
Still… 

377
00:16:07,45 --> 00:16:09,303
We had the wedding. 

378
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:10,116
What? 

379
00:16:10,116 --> 00:16:11,614
We had the wedding. Isn't that alright? 

380
00:16:11,614 --> 00:16:13,954
Don't you feel sorry to the guests? 

381
00:16:13,954 --> 00:16:16,817
I feel sorry to them. 

382
00:16:17,172 --> 00:16:19,489
(We almost couldn't have the wedding) 

383
00:16:20,141 --> 00:16:24,700
He was late when our parents met. 

384
00:16:24,701 --> 00:16:25,854
(Huh?) 

385
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:27,720
(When the parents met?) 

386
00:16:28,591 --> 00:16:31,220
(He was late from the start!) 

387
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,386
He probably tried to look nice. 

388
00:16:33,386 --> 00:16:36,896
All the parents waited for about 30 minutes. 

389
00:16:36,896 --> 00:16:40,843
I rushed him. It was because of his underwear. 

390
00:16:40,844 --> 00:16:41,457
Underwear? 

391
00:16:41,457 --> 00:16:43,639
Yes, his underwear. 

392
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:45,195
Why is that important? 

393
00:16:45,195 --> 00:16:48,650
Everyone has a jinx. 

394
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:50,714
Is it about color? 

395
00:16:50,714 --> 00:16:57,293
I have a good day when I wear red underwear. 

396
00:16:57,293 --> 00:16:59,90
I was wearing red underwear when 

397
00:16:59,90 --> 00:17:01,70
I first met my father-in-law. 

398
00:17:01,70 --> 00:17:03,814
It was really nice. That's why our parents 

399
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,330
decided to meet each other. 

400
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:08,902
Were things nice the day your parents met? 

401
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:11,547
Yes, they were. 

402
00:17:12,143 --> 00:17:13,387
Even when you were 30 minutes late? 

403
00:17:13,387 --> 00:17:17,562
I think it was the red underwear. 

404
00:17:17,563 --> 00:17:19,597
Are you wearing red underwear today? 

405
00:17:19,597 --> 00:17:22,752
Yes, it's a special day. 

406
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:27,819
The husband's family is here. 

407
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:30,152
- Hello. / - Hello. 

408
00:17:30,152 --> 00:17:31,40
That must be his brother. 

409
00:17:31,40 --> 00:17:32,443
That looks like his brother. 

410
00:17:32,443 --> 00:17:35,671
How was he when he lived at home? 

411
00:17:35,671 --> 00:17:37,819
I didn't think he was slow. 

412
00:17:37,819 --> 00:17:39,95
(Huh?) 

413
00:17:39,295 --> 00:17:40,698
(What is he talking about?) 

414
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:42,282
I didn't think he was slow. 

415
00:17:42,282 --> 00:17:46,750
He's the fastest in our family. 

416
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:48,471
Are you slower? 

417
00:17:48,471 --> 00:17:49,675
He's slower. 

418
00:17:49,675 --> 00:17:50,792
He's slower? 

419
00:17:50,792 --> 00:17:52,408
- The brother is slower? / - Yes. 

420
00:17:52,409 --> 00:17:53,441
He's the fastest in the family. 

421
00:17:53,441 --> 00:17:55,81
Yes, he is. 

422
00:17:55,81 --> 00:17:56,592
(He's Usain Bolt at home) 

423
00:17:57,685 --> 00:17:59,726
This is like a comedy program. 

424
00:17:59,726 --> 00:18:01,76
The most common thing our family says is 

425
00:18:01,76 --> 00:18:04,381
"I'm on the way", "I'm almost there". 

426
00:18:04,381 --> 00:18:07,776
If we have to shower to go out, 

427
00:18:07,776 --> 00:18:12,425
he tells me to go first since I'm slow. 

428
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:15,645
I always took a shower first. 

429
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:17,561
(They're the same) 

430
00:18:17,561 --> 00:18:19,774
Who is the slowest in the family? 

431
00:18:19,774 --> 00:18:22,262
Our mother. 

432
00:18:22,262 --> 00:18:23,811
It runs in the family. 

433
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:26,175
Is that your mother? 

434
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:28,754
No, she couldn't come. 

435
00:18:28,755 --> 00:18:31,83
She's too slow. Is she on her way? 

436
00:18:31,83 --> 00:18:32,741
Is she on her way here now? 

437
00:18:32,741 --> 00:18:37,239
I spoke to her yesterday. She said she'd come. 

438
00:18:37,239 --> 00:18:38,532
She did? 

439
00:18:38,532 --> 00:18:40,803
(Is she really on her way?) 

440
00:18:41,615 --> 00:18:43,461
I don't know what happened. 

441
00:18:43,461 --> 00:18:45,661
He doesn't know. 

442
00:18:45,661 --> 00:18:47,173
(Mother, where are you?) 

443
00:18:47,173 --> 00:18:48,973
It must be frustrating when you go to their place 

444
00:18:48,973 --> 00:18:50,748
during the holidays. 

445
00:18:50,748 --> 00:18:55,244
We make all the food the day before the rite. 

446
00:18:55,244 --> 00:18:57,591
It takes mother an hour to set the table. 

447
00:18:57,591 --> 00:19:02,112
When she remembers to put something on 

448
00:19:02,113 --> 00:19:02,977
the table, it takes her an hour. 

449
00:19:02,977 --> 00:19:07,314
It takes her 2 hours to do the dishes. 

450
00:19:07,314 --> 00:19:08,976
After that, it's lunch time. 

451
00:19:08,976 --> 00:19:10,992
The table has to be set again? 

452
00:19:10,992 --> 00:19:13,376
(She's busy all day preparing meals) 

453
00:19:14,288 --> 00:19:17,19
There's only one grave to visit, 

454
00:19:17,19 --> 00:19:19,675
but it takes 2 hours to walk up. 

455
00:19:20,495 --> 00:19:22,328
Do you know what's frustrating? 

456
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:26,868
My husband is slow, but he tells mother to hurry. 

457
00:19:26,868 --> 00:19:28,10
He says that? 

458
00:19:28,10 --> 00:19:29,351
It's really frustrating. 

459
00:19:29,351 --> 00:19:31,158
He's the fastest in the family. 

460
00:19:31,498 --> 00:19:35,419
Do you think your mom is slow? 

461
00:19:35,419 --> 00:19:40,136
My wife tells me I'm slow, 

462
00:19:40,136 --> 00:19:43,362
but I tell my mother she's slow. 

463
00:19:43,362 --> 00:19:47,338
She says "Wait, I'll get it done quickly." 

464
00:19:47,338 --> 00:19:49,895
She says that. 

465
00:19:49,895 --> 00:19:51,840
She was supposed to come today. 

466
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,976
She could be on her way. 

467
00:19:55,579 --> 00:19:57,62
(Where is she?) 

468
00:19:57,397 --> 00:19:59,816
There are several people here 

469
00:19:59,816 --> 00:20:02,189
to tell us how slow the husband is. 

470
00:20:02,189 --> 00:20:03,282
Hello. 

471
00:20:03,282 --> 00:20:04,333
Hello. 

472
00:20:04,334 --> 00:20:05,446
What is your relationship? 

473
00:20:05,446 --> 00:20:07,61
I'm her cousin. 

474
00:20:07,61 --> 00:20:08,533
- The wife's cousin? / - Yes. 

475
00:20:08,533 --> 00:20:11,16
Is he pretty slow? 

476
00:20:11,17 --> 00:20:13,296
I visit them. 

477
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:15,140
We order fried chicken. 

478
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,971
I call and ask where he is. 

479
00:20:16,971 --> 00:20:17,951
He says he's on his way home. 

480
00:20:17,951 --> 00:20:22,148
I tell him to pick up the fried chicken. 

481
00:20:22,148 --> 00:20:24,224
It takes him over an hour. 

482
00:20:25,132 --> 00:20:27,185
His workplace isn't that far. 

483
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:28,480
It's about 10 minutes from their place. 

484
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,876
So is the fried chicken place. 

485
00:20:29,876 --> 00:20:31,359
But it takes him an hour? 

486
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,48
Yes. 

487
00:20:32,48 --> 00:20:35,40
Why? Why does it take an hour? 

488
00:20:35,40 --> 00:20:36,348
He probably doesn't know. 

489
00:20:36,348 --> 00:20:39,12
(Stepping on lines holding the chicken?) 

490
00:20:40,422 --> 00:20:43,764
I don't know. When I go out, 

491
00:20:43,764 --> 00:20:47,599
everyone seems to time me with a stopwatch. 

492
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:54,461
I'm not obsessed with time. I never thought about 

493
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:56,161
how long it takes me. 

494
00:20:56,161 --> 00:20:58,388
It takes him an hour, but he doesn't realize it. 

495
00:20:58,388 --> 00:20:59,108
Right. 

496
00:20:59,108 --> 00:21:00,792
The next person. 

497
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:03,853
I'm his friend of 20 years. 

498
00:21:03,854 --> 00:21:04,340
You must know him well. 

499
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,456
Tell us about him. 

500
00:21:06,457 --> 00:21:09,81
I was the MC at their wedding. 

501
00:21:09,81 --> 00:21:12,872
He asked me to arrive an hour ahead of time. 

502
00:21:12,873 --> 00:21:15,73
When he arrived 10 minutes early? 

503
00:21:15,73 --> 00:21:17,441
The bride and groom weren't there. 

504
00:21:18,591 --> 00:21:19,862
That must have been surprising. 

505
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:23,20
I asked his mother if she knew what was going on. 

506
00:21:23,20 --> 00:21:23,729
She said he would show up 

507
00:21:23,729 --> 00:21:25,603
since it was his wedding. 

508
00:21:25,603 --> 00:21:26,592
She said that? 

509
00:21:26,592 --> 00:21:29,988
Yes. He would show up to his wedding. 

510
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:34,125
They didn't come until 10 minutes were left. 

511
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:36,709
I wondered if they were going to call off 

512
00:21:36,709 --> 00:21:40,964
the wedding like in a movie or a drama. 

513
00:21:40,964 --> 00:21:42,358
That's understandable. 

514
00:21:42,358 --> 00:21:45,629
He called me recently to go to eat jjamppong. 

515
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:48,386
He said he was parking. 

516
00:21:48,386 --> 00:21:49,318
Then you should order the noodles. 

517
00:21:49,318 --> 00:21:51,307
I ordered two bowls. 

518
00:21:51,307 --> 00:21:53,745
But he didn't come. 

519
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:57,282
I sat there with two bowls in front of me. 

520
00:21:57,282 --> 00:21:59,626
Like I was stood up. 

521
00:22:00,638 --> 00:22:03,168
(He couldn't eat and he couldn't just leave) 

522
00:22:03,168 --> 00:22:04,443
I can imagine. 

523
00:22:05,193 --> 00:22:06,672
Who is the next person? 

524
00:22:06,672 --> 00:22:07,730
I was his roommate 

525
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:09,735
for 7 years until he got married. 

526
00:22:09,735 --> 00:22:11,133
Oh, his roommate? 

527
00:22:11,134 --> 00:22:12,879
You must really know him well. 

528
00:22:12,879 --> 00:22:15,142
He's way too slow. 

529
00:22:15,143 --> 00:22:15,710
If he goes to the bathroom, 

530
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,99
he's in there for 30 minutes. 

531
00:22:17,99 --> 00:22:19,33
I had a really serious stomachache. 

532
00:22:19,34 --> 00:22:21,842
I told him to come out. 

533
00:22:21,842 --> 00:22:23,11
He said okay. 

534
00:22:23,11 --> 00:22:24,715
I said hurry! 

535
00:22:24,715 --> 00:22:26,99
"Okay." 

536
00:22:26,99 --> 00:22:29,928
I was about to go in my pants. 

537
00:22:31,678 --> 00:22:33,167
Is he like that at home, too? 

538
00:22:33,167 --> 00:22:34,447
Of course. 

539
00:22:34,447 --> 00:22:35,754
Our child knocked. 

540
00:22:35,755 --> 00:22:39,499
He said he had to pee. 

541
00:22:39,499 --> 00:22:42,266
My husband said he'd be out soon. 

542
00:22:42,266 --> 00:22:43,138
And stayed in there for half an hour? 

543
00:22:43,138 --> 00:22:48,523
The 5-year-old peed in his pants. 

544
00:22:48,523 --> 00:22:52,415
He apologized for peeing in his pants. 

545
00:22:52,415 --> 00:22:56,293
I cried with him. 

546
00:22:57,374 --> 00:22:58,203
That's sad. 

547
00:22:58,203 --> 00:23:00,195
Is your child slow? 

548
00:23:00,195 --> 00:23:02,741
The older one is really slow. 

549
00:23:02,741 --> 00:23:04,60
Does he take after his dad? 

550
00:23:04,60 --> 00:23:06,219
I think he does. 

551
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:09,506
It took 18 hours to deliver him. 

552
00:23:09,506 --> 00:23:11,936
What does that have to do with your husband? 

553
00:23:12,868 --> 00:23:14,502
You're the one who had the baby. 

554
00:23:14,502 --> 00:23:18,57
When were you the most frustrated? 

555
00:23:18,57 --> 00:23:23,329
I panic when the child is sick. 

556
00:23:23,329 --> 00:23:27,943
Once, the older one had a fever of 40 degrees. 

557
00:23:27,943 --> 00:23:29,471
I told him we should hurry to the hospital. 

558
00:23:29,471 --> 00:23:31,987
He said he'd be home soon. 

559
00:23:31,987 --> 00:23:32,536
From work? 

560
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:33,560
Yes. 

561
00:23:34,99 --> 00:23:35,403
How far away is it? 

562
00:23:35,403 --> 00:23:36,922
About 5 minutes. 

563
00:23:36,922 --> 00:23:40,383
But he didn't come for over an hour. 

564
00:23:40,383 --> 00:23:41,335
When your child was sick? 

565
00:23:41,335 --> 00:23:41,843
Yes. 

566
00:23:41,843 --> 00:23:43,835
What did you do? 

567
00:23:43,835 --> 00:23:46,970
I couldn't leave work just like that. 

568
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:48,73
You told her you'd be home soon. 

569
00:23:48,73 --> 00:23:50,641
You should have told your boss. 

570
00:23:50,641 --> 00:23:54,197
I did, but it took that long. 

571
00:23:54,197 --> 00:23:56,287
(Weren't you worried about our child?) 

572
00:23:56,288 --> 00:23:57,412
You were slow when she had to go to 

573
00:23:57,412 --> 00:23:58,676
the hospital to give birth. 

574
00:23:58,676 --> 00:24:00,247
Were you acting leisurely? 

575
00:24:00,248 --> 00:24:03,356
He put his socks on and looked for his watch. 

576
00:24:03,356 --> 00:24:05,743
It was our second child. 

577
00:24:05,743 --> 00:24:07,149
I had a bit of leisure. 

578
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:08,615
(Shock) 

579
00:24:09,139 --> 00:24:11,110
Why did you act leisurely? 

580
00:24:12,5 --> 00:24:15,18
It didn't feel right not to wear my watch. 

581
00:24:15,18 --> 00:24:16,421
Like red underwear? 

582
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:22,229
I don't go out in my pajamas. 

583
00:24:22,229 --> 00:24:23,920
(Can't you see the baby is coming?) 

584
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:28,27
It must not have been easy at work. 

585
00:24:28,27 --> 00:24:32,635
He was always late about 2-3 times a week. 

586
00:24:32,635 --> 00:24:34,362
(What a mess) 

587
00:24:34,667 --> 00:24:36,980
Being late to work isn't good. 

588
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:39,668
I do what everyone else does. 

589
00:24:39,668 --> 00:24:43,66
I wash my face, brush my teeth, shave, 

590
00:24:43,67 --> 00:24:45,640
trim my nose hair and wash my hair. 

591
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,176
How frustrating. 

592
00:24:47,176 --> 00:24:49,97
I dry my hair. 

593
00:24:49,97 --> 00:24:49,939
I eat. 

594
00:24:49,939 --> 00:24:52,59
I'll get yelled at whether I'm 5 minutes late 

595
00:24:52,59 --> 00:24:53,124
or 10 minutes late. 

596
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:54,505
(Oh!) 

597
00:24:54,505 --> 00:24:57,86
You should get to work on time. 

598
00:24:57,86 --> 00:25:00,365
Your boss will see this. 

599
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:04,687
It's alright. I quit that job. 

600
00:25:04,687 --> 00:25:09,862
I started a baseball goods store 2 years ago. 

601
00:25:09,863 --> 00:25:12,319
Does he go early since it's his store? 

602
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:17,581
It's his store. He opens and closes when he wants. 

603
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:18,793
Doesn't he think about the customers waiting? 

604
00:25:18,793 --> 00:25:20,572
They call. 

605
00:25:20,573 --> 00:25:23,336
They ask when the store will open. 

606
00:25:23,336 --> 00:25:26,884
He says he's 5 minutes away. 

607
00:25:26,884 --> 00:25:28,298
The customer waits for 30 minutes 

608
00:25:28,298 --> 00:25:30,139
and leaves angry. 

609
00:25:30,139 --> 00:25:31,923
What time was it? 

610
00:25:31,923 --> 00:25:34,168
Two in the afternoon. 

611
00:25:34,168 --> 00:25:35,360
Why does he open so late? 

612
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,891
He opens when he wants to. 

613
00:25:36,892 --> 00:25:41,617
Were you ever in a rush? 

614
00:25:41,617 --> 00:25:45,918
I think I'm fast when I run. 

615
00:25:45,918 --> 00:25:47,572
What's your time for the 100m sprint? 

616
00:25:47,778 --> 00:25:52,5
About 12 seconds in high school. 

617
00:25:52,5 --> 00:25:52,634
That's really fast. 

618
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:53,406
That's practically a professional athlete. 

619
00:25:53,406 --> 00:25:54,819
That's really fast. 

620
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:55,714
(No way) 

621
00:25:56,379 --> 00:25:58,735
Shall we see if you're really fast? 

622
00:25:58,736 --> 00:25:59,964
Yes. 

623
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:05,942
Start here, run around the set and 

624
00:26:05,942 --> 00:26:07,155
finish over there. 

625
00:26:07,868 --> 00:26:10,255
One lap is quite a distance. 

626
00:26:10,256 --> 00:26:11,381
Get ready. 

627
00:26:11,381 --> 00:26:12,748
Run. 

628
00:26:13,215 --> 00:26:16,130
(I'll show you what speed is) 

629
00:26:17,111 --> 00:26:19,607
(They can't imagine him running) 

630
00:26:19,607 --> 00:26:21,354
(How fast does he run?) 

631
00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:23,839
Get ready! 

632
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:26,31
Go! 

633
00:26:27,695 --> 00:26:29,319
Oh, he's fast. 

634
00:26:30,387 --> 00:26:32,90
(What?) 

635
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:34,6
(How can this be?) 

636
00:26:35,726 --> 00:26:37,842
(He's fast) 

637
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:40,871
(Running at full speed) 

638
00:26:42,895 --> 00:26:44,315
(In a daze) 

639
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,923
(Is this a dream?) 

640
00:26:47,581 --> 00:26:48,863
He's fast! 

641
00:26:48,864 --> 00:26:50,317
I can't believe it. 

642
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:51,537
He fell! 

643
00:26:55,42 --> 00:26:56,400
(He fell because he was too fast) 

644
00:26:59,192 --> 00:27:00,756
(It's like a scene from "The Chaser") 

645
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,774
He's really fast. 

646
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,947
(He's amazingly fast!) 

647
00:27:07,671 --> 00:27:08,955
He's fast. 

648
00:27:09,312 --> 00:27:10,863
(A kangaroo jump) 

649
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,248
(He finished just like that) 

650
00:27:13,908 --> 00:27:17,611
(I saw a miracle) 

651
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,778
He's really fast. 

652
00:27:19,778 --> 00:27:21,138
(You're really fast) 

653
00:27:22,185 --> 00:27:23,177
(This is basic) 

654
00:27:24,185 --> 00:27:27,236
(Is this the same person?) 

655
00:27:28,51 --> 00:27:29,826
You would have arrived in 5 minutes 

656
00:27:29,826 --> 00:27:31,654
if you ran like that with the fried chicken. 

657
00:27:31,654 --> 00:27:33,893
Or when your baby was sick. 

658
00:27:33,893 --> 00:27:35,822
It took him 22 seconds. 

659
00:27:35,822 --> 00:27:37,460
He was really fast when he got up from falling. 

660
00:27:37,461 --> 00:27:38,865
You never saw him like this? 

661
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:41,99
Yes. I never saw him run. 

662
00:27:41,99 --> 00:27:42,649
Do you think it was sexy? 

663
00:27:43,181 --> 00:27:44,673
Isn't it charming? 

664
00:27:44,673 --> 00:27:46,153
(That's the man I am) 

665
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:50,116
He'd be faster if he always ran. 

666
00:27:50,116 --> 00:27:50,796
Right. 

667
00:27:50,796 --> 00:27:51,503
He's really fast. 

668
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,301
If someone has to use the bathroom, 

669
00:27:53,301 --> 00:27:54,904
you should say you'll be 5 minutes. 

670
00:27:54,904 --> 00:27:56,945
You should be more precise. 

671
00:27:56,945 --> 00:27:59,702
I said that to my wife. 

672
00:27:59,702 --> 00:28:02,961
I said I'd be there in 10 minutes or 5 minutes. 

673
00:28:02,961 --> 00:28:06,769
I was late and got into more trouble. 

674
00:28:06,769 --> 00:28:13,737
I'm slower if I set a time. 

675
00:28:13,737 --> 00:28:15,221
No way. 

676
00:28:15,221 --> 00:28:16,730
Then be honest. 

677
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:18,363
Why do you bother wearing a watch? 

678
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:21,101
You can't go out without your watch! 

679
00:28:21,101 --> 00:28:22,659
Why don't you keep time? 

680
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:26,19
Okay. Say what you want to your husband. 

681
00:28:26,19 --> 00:28:30,443
You're always full of leisure, 

682
00:28:30,443 --> 00:28:33,638
but it always makes me anxious and nervous. 

683
00:28:33,638 --> 00:28:37,86
I wish you'd act faster. 

684
00:28:37,86 --> 00:28:42,159
Move faster in urgent situations. 

685
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,876
Hyesung, is it a concern or not? 

686
00:28:45,876 --> 00:28:48,47
I think it's a concern. 

687
00:28:48,47 --> 00:28:52,660
If the situation calls for it, you have to rush. 

688
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,482
That's what a cool person does. 

689
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:57,942
I think it's definitely a concern. 

690
00:28:57,942 --> 00:29:00,357
I think it's a concern, too. 

691
00:29:00,357 --> 00:29:03,318
I don't think it's a concern. 

692
00:29:03,318 --> 00:29:09,519
I get stressed when I think about being on time. 

693
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:11,853
But he doesn't think. 

694
00:29:12,677 --> 00:29:13,925
He's full of leisure. 

695
00:29:13,925 --> 00:29:16,22
He doesn't care about time. 

696
00:29:16,22 --> 00:29:17,681
He wears a watch, but he doesn't care. 

697
00:29:17,681 --> 00:29:18,561
Right. 

698
00:29:18,561 --> 00:29:21,245
He's not stressed at all. 

699
00:29:21,245 --> 00:29:23,383
I think he'll live a long life. 

700
00:29:23,384 --> 00:29:24,624
- He'll live long? / - Yes. 

701
00:29:24,624 --> 00:29:26,479
If you understand her concern, 

702
00:29:26,479 --> 00:29:27,798
press the button! 

703
00:29:27,798 --> 00:29:29,848
(What does the audience think?) 

704
00:29:31,445 --> 00:29:32,559
5. 

705
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:33,711
4. 

706
00:29:33,711 --> 00:29:34,783
3. 

707
00:29:34,783 --> 00:29:36,110
2. 

708
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,457
1. 

709
00:29:37,458 --> 00:29:38,670
Okay. 

710
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:40,431
Show us the result! 

711
00:29:41,387 --> 00:29:42,863
The last digit. 

712
00:29:43,363 --> 00:29:45,588
(A new winner with 177 votes?) 

713
00:29:46,32 --> 00:29:47,236
Is it 177? 

714
00:29:47,237 --> 00:29:48,845
(Nervous) 

715
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:52,632
About 147? 

716
00:29:52,632 --> 00:29:54,31
157! 

717
00:29:54,724 --> 00:29:57,164
(Eliminated) 

718
00:29:58,209 --> 00:29:59,332
(Survives) 

719
00:30:01,915 --> 00:30:04,444
The title is 'Smooch, Smooch, Smooch!' 

720
00:30:04,444 --> 00:30:09,772
Hello, I'll be in the 4th grade. I'm Shin Sarang. 

721
00:30:09,772 --> 00:30:13,67
I'm always kissed every day. 

722
00:30:13,67 --> 00:30:17,127
The person who kisses me is my dad. 

723
00:30:17,127 --> 00:30:19,300
Dad, good morning. 

724
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,216
"Oh, Sarang, you're up." 

725
00:30:21,216 --> 00:30:22,732
"Okay, 30 kisses." 

726
00:30:22,732 --> 00:30:23,971
30 kisses? 

727
00:30:23,971 --> 00:30:25,511
Smooch, smooch, smooch. 

728
00:30:25,511 --> 00:30:27,207
When he gets home… 

729
00:30:27,208 --> 00:30:28,808
"Sarang, daddy's home!" 

730
00:30:28,808 --> 00:30:30,624
"50 kisses!" 

731
00:30:30,624 --> 00:30:31,880
Smooch, smooch, smooch. 

732
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,30
When I eat… 

733
00:30:33,30 --> 00:30:34,927
"Sarang eats so well." 

734
00:30:34,927 --> 00:30:36,371
"30 kisses." 

735
00:30:36,372 --> 00:30:37,815
"Sarang, you brushed your teeth." 

736
00:30:37,815 --> 00:30:39,491
"30 kisses." 

737
00:30:39,491 --> 00:30:44,410
He kisses me over 200 times a day. 

738
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:45,299
That's a lot. 

739
00:30:45,299 --> 00:30:46,918
She counted. 

740
00:30:46,918 --> 00:30:50,146
When we wait for the pedestrian light to change… 

741
00:30:50,146 --> 00:30:53,183
"Sarang walks so pretty." Smooch, smooch, smooch. 

742
00:30:53,183 --> 00:30:54,171
On the street? 

743
00:30:54,171 --> 00:30:57,483
"She's not a baby. What a strange dad." 

744
00:30:57,483 --> 00:30:59,760
People point and talk, but he keeps kissing me. 

745
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,417
Do you know what my friends say? 

746
00:31:02,417 --> 00:31:04,837
"Sarang, you still kiss your dad?" 

747
00:31:04,837 --> 00:31:08,568
"Sarang's dad kisses her." 

748
00:31:08,568 --> 00:31:11,492
It's so embarrassing. 

749
00:31:11,492 --> 00:31:14,22
Counselor MCs, please stop my dad 

750
00:31:14,22 --> 00:31:15,880
from kissing me. 

751
00:31:17,385 --> 00:31:19,209
(Poor thing) 

752
00:31:19,209 --> 00:31:21,520
Did your parents kiss you a lot? 

753
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:24,825
I have a younger brother. I'm the oldest son. 

754
00:31:24,825 --> 00:31:27,646
My father was really scary. 

755
00:31:27,646 --> 00:31:29,498
If I have a daughter, I'll kiss her. 

756
00:31:29,498 --> 00:31:30,311
I think you'll be good at it. 

757
00:31:30,311 --> 00:31:31,346
Sure. 

758
00:31:31,346 --> 00:31:32,267
I can't? 

759
00:31:32,267 --> 00:31:33,299
No. 

760
00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:34,350
I can't? 

761
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:36,142
(Surprised) 

762
00:31:36,142 --> 00:31:38,663
Why can't I kiss my daughter? 

763
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:40,276
It's his daughter. 

764
00:31:40,276 --> 00:31:42,519
You can't say no even if you're his fan. 

765
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:44,279
That's wrong of you. 

766
00:31:45,83 --> 00:31:48,163
(Discipline seems nature for the idol of 18 years) 

767
00:31:48,163 --> 00:31:50,604
She's the same age as my son. 

768
00:31:50,604 --> 00:31:52,690
I kiss my son a lot, too. 

769
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:57,222
He promised to until the 9th grade. 

770
00:31:57,222 --> 00:31:58,780
He'll allow it until the 9th grade? 

771
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:03,937
Yes. He told me not to be so anxious or upset. 

772
00:32:03,938 --> 00:32:05,611
Why not after the 9th grade? 

773
00:32:05,611 --> 00:32:07,530
I don't know. That's what he said. 

774
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:09,372
(Because…) 

775
00:32:09,973 --> 00:32:12,526
He'll smell like cigarettes in high school. 

776
00:32:13,249 --> 00:32:15,105
(Oh, my son…) 

777
00:32:15,105 --> 00:32:17,931
Let's meet her and talk more. 

778
00:32:17,931 --> 00:32:18,787
Come on out! 

779
00:32:18,787 --> 00:32:22,228
(Who is tired of her dad kissing her?) 

780
00:32:23,918 --> 00:32:24,946
How cute. 

781
00:32:26,502 --> 00:32:28,422
(Shin Sarang) 

782
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:32,254
(Two guys get up) 

783
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:36,947
(My hand…) 

784
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:40,644
What is this? 

785
00:32:41,7 --> 00:32:42,790
K.Will, what will you do? 

786
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:44,577
You're really honest. 

787
00:32:44,577 --> 00:32:46,178
She's honest. 

788
00:32:46,178 --> 00:32:48,249
I saw her. 

789
00:32:48,249 --> 00:32:51,408
She looked at K.Will and Ryeowook, 

790
00:32:51,408 --> 00:32:52,866
then held Ryeowook's hand. 

791
00:32:52,866 --> 00:32:54,222
She's really honest. 

792
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56,364
K.Will was closer. 

793
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,328
How do you feel right now? 

794
00:32:59,328 --> 00:33:00,822
Me? 

795
00:33:00,823 --> 00:33:02,508
Can I swear? 

796
00:33:02,508 --> 00:33:04,93
Gee… 

797
00:33:04,93 --> 00:33:06,30
Was it in the confusion of the moment 

798
00:33:06,30 --> 00:33:08,107
or do you like Ryeowook? 

799
00:33:08,107 --> 00:33:09,915
It was the moment. 

800
00:33:09,915 --> 00:33:12,797
Please introduce yourself. 

801
00:33:12,797 --> 00:33:14,605
Hello, I'm from Cheongju. 

802
00:33:14,605 --> 00:33:16,954
I'm in the pre-4th grade. I'm Shin Sarang. 

803
00:33:16,954 --> 00:33:18,672
The pre-4th grade. 

804
00:33:19,495 --> 00:33:20,572
How cute. 

805
00:33:20,573 --> 00:33:21,764
The pre-4th grade. 

806
00:33:22,581 --> 00:33:24,774
Is it such a concern that your dad kisses you? 

807
00:33:24,774 --> 00:33:25,517
Yes. 

808
00:33:25,518 --> 00:33:30,523
I'm not a baby. I'm all grown up. 

809
00:33:30,523 --> 00:33:34,264
I'm 155cm tall. I'm taller than other kids my age. 

810
00:33:34,264 --> 00:33:38,958
I read a lot these days, so I'm smarter. 

811
00:33:38,959 --> 00:33:41,715
But my dad thinks I'm little. 

812
00:33:41,715 --> 00:33:44,19
How much does he kiss you? 

813
00:33:44,19 --> 00:33:45,219
He kisses me everywhere. 

814
00:33:45,219 --> 00:33:47,577
My cheeks, forehead, eyes, ears… 

815
00:33:47,577 --> 00:33:49,77
he bites my ears a lot. 

816
00:33:49,77 --> 00:33:52,132
My hands, mouth, everywhere. 

817
00:33:52,132 --> 00:33:55,372
A hundred times is basic. 

818
00:33:55,372 --> 00:33:58,30
We're together on holidays. 

819
00:33:58,30 --> 00:34:01,527
Sometimes, it's over a thousand times. 

820
00:34:01,527 --> 00:34:02,227
Really. 

821
00:34:02,227 --> 00:34:03,143
Did you count? 

822
00:34:03,143 --> 00:34:04,503
Yes, I did. 

823
00:34:05,171 --> 00:34:09,512
There's proof. Let's take a look. 

824
00:34:09,512 --> 00:34:10,718
Show us. 

825
00:34:11,279 --> 00:34:12,2
Agh! 

826
00:34:12,2 --> 00:34:14,56
He kisses you like that? 

827
00:34:14,56 --> 00:34:15,944
No wonder you don't like it. 

828
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:18,355
Her expression… 

829
00:34:18,791 --> 00:34:19,999
She doesn't look that happy. 

830
00:34:19,998 --> 00:34:22,322
She didn't get to eat yet. 

831
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:23,978
He won't let her get away. 

832
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:25,467
It's a head lock. 

833
00:34:25,467 --> 00:34:27,827
(It's more of a head lock than a kiss) 

834
00:34:27,827 --> 00:34:31,31
Don't your friends kiss their dads? 

835
00:34:31,31 --> 00:34:33,926
I'm sure some do, 

836
00:34:33,926 --> 00:34:36,578
but not like this. 

837
00:34:36,578 --> 00:34:39,219
You're really bright. 

838
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:41,787
I'd kiss you a lot if I was your dad. 

839
00:34:41,786 --> 00:34:45,210
You're such a bright girl. Why did you do that? 

840
00:34:46,822 --> 00:34:49,884
(Why didn't you hold my hand?) 

841
00:34:49,884 --> 00:34:51,580
Forget about that. 

842
00:34:52,217 --> 00:34:54,509
(It's not easy) 

843
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:57,864
Dad must have a reason. 

844
00:34:57,864 --> 00:35:00,139
Let's meet him. Hello. 

845
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:01,708
Hello. 

846
00:35:02,899 --> 00:35:05,770
What do you think? It's a concern for her. 

847
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:09,846
Why is a dad kissing his daughter a concern? 

848
00:35:09,846 --> 00:35:12,912
If she hates it so much, 

849
00:35:12,912 --> 00:35:15,596
she shouldn't be my daughter. 

850
00:35:15,597 --> 00:35:17,672
Leave if you're not going to kiss me? 

851
00:35:17,672 --> 00:35:18,778
Right. 

852
00:35:18,778 --> 00:35:20,319
Is that what you're saying? 

853
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:24,269
She exaggerated when she said 

854
00:35:24,269 --> 00:35:26,31
you kissed her a thousand times, right? 

855
00:35:26,32 --> 00:35:27,308
A thousand times on holidays. 

856
00:35:27,308 --> 00:35:30,536
Sometimes, it's over a thousand times. 

857
00:35:31,108 --> 00:35:32,760
Look at her. 

858
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:38,154
She's so pretty and cute. 

859
00:35:38,154 --> 00:35:41,416
I think that's why I keep kissing her. 

860
00:35:41,416 --> 00:35:45,109
How are you cute? 

861
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:47,520
When I want to buy something… 

862
00:35:47,521 --> 00:35:50,430
Oh, there's a purpose. 

863
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:53,940
If I ask him to buy something for me, 

864
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:56,477
he buys everything. 

865
00:35:57,357 --> 00:35:59,552
(He loves his daughter) 

866
00:35:59,552 --> 00:36:01,296
It's alright for him to kiss you then, right? 

867
00:36:01,296 --> 00:36:02,497
Yes. 

868
00:36:03,208 --> 00:36:04,597
I kiss him then. 

869
00:36:04,597 --> 00:36:06,322
(Can you see why?) 

870
00:36:07,868 --> 00:36:14,366
It's embarrassing for her on the street. 

871
00:36:14,367 --> 00:36:18,27
She's so pretty. I can't hold back. 

872
00:36:18,27 --> 00:36:20,579
It might look like a head lock, 

873
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:24,633
but it's my expression of affection. 

874
00:36:24,633 --> 00:36:27,452
Show us. How do you do it? 

875
00:36:28,85 --> 00:36:29,607
(A reenactment) 

876
00:36:29,607 --> 00:36:32,330
We'll see if Sarang was exaggerating. 

877
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:33,587
You met. She's cute. 

878
00:36:33,587 --> 00:36:36,442
(Smooch, smooch!) 

879
00:36:37,911 --> 00:36:40,909
(This is how they go to the grocery store) 

880
00:36:41,998 --> 00:36:43,838
(The audience stirs) 

881
00:36:44,478 --> 00:36:46,558
(He doesn't care) 

882
00:36:47,32 --> 00:36:47,879
(Poof) 

883
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,322
(A cool exit) 

884
00:36:51,491 --> 00:36:53,627
That's an abduction. 

885
00:36:54,918 --> 00:36:57,444
It's like a bird pecking on feed. 

886
00:36:57,444 --> 00:37:00,508
Her friend saw this. 

887
00:37:00,508 --> 00:37:01,910
Is that the friend? 

888
00:37:01,911 --> 00:37:03,19
Yes. 

889
00:37:03,19 --> 00:37:04,66
Hi. 

890
00:37:04,66 --> 00:37:05,569
Hello. 

891
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:08,505
Introduce yourself. You're her friend? 

892
00:37:08,505 --> 00:37:10,272
A close friend. 

893
00:37:11,29 --> 00:37:13,220
(I see) 

894
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,942
I didn't imagine. 

895
00:37:14,942 --> 00:37:19,63
Did you see her dad kiss her? 

896
00:37:19,63 --> 00:37:19,974
Yes. 

897
00:37:19,974 --> 00:37:21,447
(Ha ha ha) 

898
00:37:23,291 --> 00:37:24,305
Tell us. 

899
00:37:24,305 --> 00:37:26,879
I went over to her place. 

900
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:33,317
Her dad kissed her on the cheek and hugged her. 

901
00:37:33,317 --> 00:37:34,421
What did you think? 

902
00:37:34,421 --> 00:37:35,325
I envied her. 

903
00:37:35,325 --> 00:37:36,232
She envied her. 

904
00:37:36,232 --> 00:37:37,50
You envied her? 

905
00:37:37,50 --> 00:37:38,263
Your dad doesn't kiss you? 

906
00:37:38,263 --> 00:37:39,65
No. 

907
00:37:39,385 --> 00:37:41,409
Your dad doesn't kiss you much? 

908
00:37:41,409 --> 00:37:42,34
No. 

909
00:37:42,34 --> 00:37:43,300
- Is that why you envied her? / - Yes. 

910
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,520
What if your dad kissed you a thousand times? 

911
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,899
I'd still like it. 

912
00:37:48,241 --> 00:37:50,313
Your friend envies you. 

913
00:37:50,313 --> 00:37:54,1
He kisses me too much. 

914
00:37:54,1 --> 00:37:56,678
He touches my butt on the street, too. 

915
00:37:56,678 --> 00:37:57,462
Your butt? 

916
00:37:57,462 --> 00:38:00,184
Yes, when we stop at a light. 

917
00:38:00,184 --> 00:38:04,486
Do you really touch her butt? 

918
00:38:04,486 --> 00:38:05,144
She's cute. 

919
00:38:05,144 --> 00:38:10,296
She yells and runs. 

920
00:38:10,296 --> 00:38:13,511
That's so cute. 

921
00:38:13,511 --> 00:38:16,55
That's why I do that. 

922
00:38:16,55 --> 00:38:19,527
What do you think of that? 

923
00:38:19,527 --> 00:38:22,147
I'd like that a lot. 

924
00:38:22,147 --> 00:38:24,71
Oh, boy. 

925
00:38:24,71 --> 00:38:25,598
You'd like that a lot? 

926
00:38:26,253 --> 00:38:27,927
She'd like it. 

927
00:38:27,927 --> 00:38:29,190
Why did you bring her? 

928
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:31,601
She's not on your side. 

929
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:36,452
Try it for a month. It's really tough! 

930
00:38:36,452 --> 00:38:40,864
When was the last time your dad kissed you? 

931
00:38:40,864 --> 00:38:41,610
I don't know. 

932
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:43,101
She doesn't know. She doesn't remember. 

933
00:38:43,101 --> 00:38:47,803
Tell your dad to kiss you. 

934
00:38:47,803 --> 00:38:53,87
Dad, I want to be loved like Sarang, too. 

935
00:38:54,235 --> 00:38:56,391
Come here. You're the one with a concern. 

936
00:38:57,519 --> 00:38:59,790
(I need an average dad) 

937
00:39:00,155 --> 00:39:02,884
Is he only like that to you or your sister, too? 

938
00:39:02,884 --> 00:39:03,953
Everyone. 

939
00:39:03,953 --> 00:39:04,893
Your whole family? 

940
00:39:04,893 --> 00:39:06,81
Yes. 

941
00:39:06,81 --> 00:39:07,39
What grade is your sister in? 

942
00:39:07,39 --> 00:39:09,60
She's in the 9th grade. 

943
00:39:09,60 --> 00:39:10,600
She's going through puberty. 

944
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,275
About a hundred times for my sister. 

945
00:39:13,275 --> 00:39:13,958
What about your mom? 

946
00:39:13,958 --> 00:39:16,661
About 150 times. 

947
00:39:16,661 --> 00:39:20,422
It's a concern for all three of us. 

948
00:39:21,183 --> 00:39:23,696
(Let's hear from the sister) 

949
00:39:23,696 --> 00:39:26,384
Does he kiss you a lot, too? 

950
00:39:26,385 --> 00:39:27,979
Yes, a lot. 

951
00:39:27,979 --> 00:39:30,573
Since I was little. If our eyes meet… 

952
00:39:30,574 --> 00:39:33,123
If your eyes meet? 

953
00:39:33,123 --> 00:39:34,807
What do you do? 

954
00:39:34,807 --> 00:39:36,879
I'm in the 9th grade. 

955
00:39:36,879 --> 00:39:41,576
I run. He comes after me and forces it. 

956
00:39:41,576 --> 00:39:42,969
It's irritating. 

957
00:39:42,969 --> 00:39:46,5
If Sarang passes, he kisses her? 

958
00:39:46,5 --> 00:39:47,527
Right. 

959
00:39:47,527 --> 00:39:51,971
He walks around like a dog that has to poop. 

960
00:39:51,971 --> 00:39:53,756
A kiss here, a kiss there. 

961
00:39:53,756 --> 00:39:57,328
What can you say to your sister? 

962
00:39:57,328 --> 00:40:00,995
Until you're independent… 

963
00:40:01,664 --> 00:40:03,34
(There's no solution) 

964
00:40:03,34 --> 00:40:04,410
That's a long time away. 

965
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:06,225
You have to live with it. 

966
00:40:06,225 --> 00:40:07,341
She has no choice? 

967
00:40:07,341 --> 00:40:08,781
Right. 

968
00:40:09,263 --> 00:40:14,330
Father, you weren't kissed much as a child? 

969
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:16,832
Or were you kissed too much? 

970
00:40:16,832 --> 00:40:22,391
My parents never expressed their affection. 

971
00:40:22,391 --> 00:40:24,83
- Both parents? / - Yes. 

972
00:40:24,83 --> 00:40:31,851
I told myself I'd express my affection a lot 

973
00:40:31,851 --> 00:40:32,609
to my children. 

974
00:40:32,609 --> 00:40:35,73
I think that's why I kiss them a lot. 

975
00:40:35,73 --> 00:40:38,26
Let's hear from mom. Hello. 

976
00:40:38,26 --> 00:40:39,917
She could think differently. 

977
00:40:39,917 --> 00:40:43,357
I have a hard time because he calls so much. 

978
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:44,500
He calls? 

979
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:51,256
My co-worker said he called 4 times in 30 minutes. 

980
00:40:51,256 --> 00:40:54,292
It makes me a bit uncomfortable. 

981
00:40:54,292 --> 00:40:57,756
I know you love your family, 

982
00:40:57,756 --> 00:40:59,982
but can't you see it's hard for them? 

983
00:40:59,982 --> 00:41:02,362
I don't call that much. 

984
00:41:02,362 --> 00:41:04,457
You called four times in 30 minutes. 

985
00:41:04,457 --> 00:41:06,26
To Sarang… 

986
00:41:06,26 --> 00:41:07,402
You call her, too? 

987
00:41:07,402 --> 00:41:10,540
About seven times? Twenty at most. 

988
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,304
In one day? 

989
00:41:11,304 --> 00:41:11,829
In one day. 

990
00:41:11,829 --> 00:41:13,157
What about your older daughter? 

991
00:41:13,157 --> 00:41:16,77
She doesn't answer her phone that well. 

992
00:41:16,77 --> 00:41:18,645
She doesn't answer my calls. 

993
00:41:18,645 --> 00:41:20,562
She said you call your wife 50 times a day. 

994
00:41:20,562 --> 00:41:23,645
Yes, about fifty times. 

995
00:41:26,102 --> 00:41:27,738
(That's unimaginable) 

996
00:41:28,609 --> 00:41:32,275
My dad called me in school. 

997
00:41:32,275 --> 00:41:35,826
He acts really cute. 

998
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:37,808
He said "Sarang, what are you doing?" 

999
00:41:37,808 --> 00:41:41,682
A 1st grader heard that. 

1000
00:41:41,682 --> 00:41:46,89
He said "Are you a little baby?" and teased me. 

1001
00:41:46,89 --> 00:41:49,394
I cried at home. My dad asked what was wrong 

1002
00:41:49,394 --> 00:41:51,370
and kissed me again. 

1003
00:41:51,771 --> 00:41:53,377
To make things worse. 

1004
00:41:53,377 --> 00:41:56,645
How do you act cute? I can't imagine. 

1005
00:41:56,646 --> 00:41:59,174
You don't look like you could be cute. 

1006
00:41:59,174 --> 00:42:00,526
How do you act cute? 

1007
00:42:00,526 --> 00:42:01,826
Let's say you called her. 

1008
00:42:01,826 --> 00:42:02,821
Hello? 

1009
00:42:02,821 --> 00:42:04,556
Sarang, it's me, dad. 

1010
00:42:04,556 --> 00:42:06,77
Give me a kiss. 

1011
00:42:06,77 --> 00:42:10,118
Sarang, you're pretty. Kiss. Smooch. 

1012
00:42:10,118 --> 00:42:12,623
It's driving me crazy. 

1013
00:42:13,275 --> 00:42:14,641
It gave me goose bumps. 

1014
00:42:14,641 --> 00:42:19,989
Many daughters marry someone like their dad. 

1015
00:42:19,989 --> 00:42:23,693
Do you think you should marry someone like him? 

1016
00:42:23,693 --> 00:42:24,629
When you get married? 

1017
00:42:24,629 --> 00:42:26,118
I don't think I will. 

1018
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:26,843
Why not? 

1019
00:42:26,843 --> 00:42:29,565
It's a bit disgusting. 

1020
00:42:29,565 --> 00:42:30,574
Oh. 

1021
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:32,754
What's disgusting? 

1022
00:42:32,754 --> 00:42:34,522
That was a bit disgusting. 

1023
00:42:34,522 --> 00:42:35,986
It's not that. 

1024
00:42:35,986 --> 00:42:39,558
I like to dance. I like teaching. 

1025
00:42:39,558 --> 00:42:44,422
I taught him how to do a dance by Girl's Day. 

1026
00:42:44,422 --> 00:42:46,790
It was really disgusting. 

1027
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:47,738
I can imagine. 

1028
00:42:47,738 --> 00:42:53,426
It looks disgusting the way he moves, right? 

1029
00:42:53,426 --> 00:42:55,301
Yes, it's detestable. 

1030
00:42:55,301 --> 00:42:56,178
It's that bad? 

1031
00:42:56,178 --> 00:42:59,433
You did a girl group dance? 

1032
00:42:59,434 --> 00:43:02,973
Sarang's dream is to be a dance singer. 

1033
00:43:02,973 --> 00:43:09,937
I try to dance with her. 

1034
00:43:09,937 --> 00:43:11,272
The friend. 

1035
00:43:11,272 --> 00:43:12,569
Hold the mic. 

1036
00:43:12,569 --> 00:43:17,465
What do you think of that? 

1037
00:43:17,465 --> 00:43:19,344
I think it's fun. I like it. 

1038
00:43:19,344 --> 00:43:20,407
You like it? 

1039
00:43:21,274 --> 00:43:22,374
You like everything. 

1040
00:43:22,374 --> 00:43:24,908
Let's talk after we see him dance. 

1041
00:43:25,312 --> 00:43:26,324
Okay? 

1042
00:43:26,324 --> 00:43:28,77
(A bad feeling) 

1043
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,286
(Dad heads to the stage) 

1044
00:43:31,286 --> 00:43:32,879
It will be embarrassing by himself. 

1045
00:43:32,879 --> 00:43:34,360
Dance with him. 

1046
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,53
"Expectation". 

1047
00:43:36,53 --> 00:43:38,821
Give us music. 

1048
00:43:42,558 --> 00:43:43,875
(Here goes) 

1049
00:43:45,252 --> 00:43:46,565
Oh, oh, oh! 

1050
00:43:46,994 --> 00:43:48,849
(Flexible) 

1051
00:43:48,849 --> 00:43:50,770
You're more disgusting! 

1052
00:43:51,903 --> 00:43:53,234
(I can't lose) 

1053
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:55,530
(Fluttering) 

1054
00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:57,259
(Limp) 

1055
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:01,137
Father, are you drunk? 

1056
00:44:01,937 --> 00:44:03,839
(I'm intoxicated by the music) 

1057
00:44:05,84 --> 00:44:06,752
(A drunk move) 

1058
00:44:07,912 --> 00:44:09,513
(Let's be independent) 

1059
00:44:12,181 --> 00:44:14,569
(You're driving me crazy) 

1060
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:16,865
(Into it 200%) 

1061
00:44:18,128 --> 00:44:19,221
(Poke, poke) 

1062
00:44:20,793 --> 00:44:23,308
(Another cool exit) 

1063
00:44:23,308 --> 00:44:24,501
He dances well. 

1064
00:44:24,501 --> 00:44:27,517
How would you feel if your dad danced like that? 

1065
00:44:27,517 --> 00:44:29,109
She covered her eyes. 

1066
00:44:29,109 --> 00:44:30,75
She looked down. 

1067
00:44:30,75 --> 00:44:33,417
I wouldn't teach him. 

1068
00:44:33,418 --> 00:44:35,99
She wouldn't teach him. 

1069
00:44:35,99 --> 00:44:40,763
He's pretty good for his age. 

1070
00:44:40,763 --> 00:44:41,508
He's good. 

1071
00:44:41,508 --> 00:44:43,379
He turns his waist well. 

1072
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,883
I take after my dad when it comes to dancing. 

1073
00:44:46,884 --> 00:44:49,885
You have a nice personality after your dad. 

1074
00:44:50,705 --> 00:44:52,248
So why did you do that? 

1075
00:44:53,101 --> 00:44:55,531
Stop it! She's just a kid! 

1076
00:44:55,531 --> 00:44:57,595
Forget about it. 

1077
00:44:57,595 --> 00:45:01,234
(He has a grudge against a pre-4th grader) 

1078
00:45:01,234 --> 00:45:04,610
I'm curious. 

1079
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:06,80
What do you do? 

1080
00:45:07,688 --> 00:45:10,566
I'm a policeman. 

1081
00:45:10,566 --> 00:45:12,4
A policeman? 

1082
00:45:13,217 --> 00:45:15,326
He's a policeman. 

1083
00:45:15,326 --> 00:45:17,740
Then start answering honestly. 

1084
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:18,616
Understood? 

1085
00:45:18,616 --> 00:45:19,181
Yes. 

1086
00:45:19,181 --> 00:45:20,621
It sounds like an interrogation. 

1087
00:45:20,621 --> 00:45:23,556
What time did you start kissing her today? 

1088
00:45:24,589 --> 00:45:26,253
I got up at 7:30, so… 

1089
00:45:26,253 --> 00:45:28,520
I started at seven. 

1090
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,573
Answer honestly! 

1091
00:45:31,226 --> 00:45:33,685
How many times did you kiss her today? 

1092
00:45:33,685 --> 00:45:38,153
I can't be precise, but 100-150 times. 

1093
00:45:38,153 --> 00:45:39,993
How many times did he kiss you today? 

1094
00:45:39,994 --> 00:45:42,186
Over 150 times. 

1095
00:45:42,186 --> 00:45:44,822
We have proof. 

1096
00:45:44,822 --> 00:45:45,470
Really? 

1097
00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:46,140
Yes. 

1098
00:45:46,141 --> 00:45:47,963
We have a video. 

1099
00:45:47,963 --> 00:45:49,698
Let's take a look. 

1100
00:45:49,698 --> 00:45:51,51
You don't know about this. 

1101
00:45:51,51 --> 00:45:53,173
Let's take a look at the proof. 

1102
00:45:55,273 --> 00:46:00,130
We had a hidden camera in the van. 

1103
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:00,923
The van? 

1104
00:46:00,923 --> 00:46:02,388
Yes. 

1105
00:46:02,388 --> 00:46:03,948
(I let my guard down) 

1106
00:46:05,176 --> 00:46:06,984
(9:00 a.m., the day of the recording) 

1107
00:46:07,584 --> 00:46:10,337
(Hidden camera of the family coming from Cheongju) 

1108
00:46:11,341 --> 00:46:12,676
(The seat is…) 

1109
00:46:13,632 --> 00:46:15,657
(It's too far to kiss) 

1110
00:46:16,844 --> 00:46:18,320
(Hm…) 

1111
00:46:19,362 --> 00:46:21,241
He's smacking his lips. 

1112
00:46:21,241 --> 00:46:23,100
He's getting warmed up. 

1113
00:46:24,628 --> 00:46:26,564
(Her friend gets in the car) 

1114
00:46:26,564 --> 00:46:28,243
(Sarang moves over) 

1115
00:46:29,469 --> 00:46:31,249
(Should I start now?) 

1116
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,136
(Embarrassed) 

1117
00:46:36,921 --> 00:46:39,87
This is my concern. 

1118
00:46:41,456 --> 00:46:42,624
(Neat) 

1119
00:46:44,44 --> 00:46:45,712
Your chin hurts! 

1120
00:46:46,548 --> 00:46:49,296
(Why is dad's beard prickly?) 

1121
00:46:50,49 --> 00:46:51,821
(Stuck like gum) 

1122
00:46:51,821 --> 00:46:53,218
(Sniffing) 

1123
00:46:54,302 --> 00:46:56,55
Stop it! 

1124
00:46:56,714 --> 00:46:58,246
(Stop what?) 

1125
00:47:01,11 --> 00:47:03,797
(This isn't a replay) 

1126
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:07,706
(He kissed her in the same spot a dozen times) 

1127
00:47:07,706 --> 00:47:08,599
It's too much. 

1128
00:47:08,599 --> 00:47:10,726
Her friend is there. 

1129
00:47:11,50 --> 00:47:12,275
(I feel stiff) 

1130
00:47:12,821 --> 00:47:15,44
(Tired from kissing too much) 

1131
00:47:15,764 --> 00:47:18,268
(He takes a break) 

1132
00:47:19,474 --> 00:47:20,740
(10 minutes later) 

1133
00:47:21,696 --> 00:47:23,313
(He's recharged) 

1134
00:47:24,284 --> 00:47:25,645
(Smile) 

1135
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:27,799
(Agh!) 

1136
00:47:28,848 --> 00:47:29,759
(My baby) 

1137
00:47:30,332 --> 00:47:31,435
(He starts kissing her again) 

1138
00:47:31,436 --> 00:47:32,721
It hurts! 

1139
00:47:33,333 --> 00:47:34,146
Why is it a concern? 

1140
00:47:34,146 --> 00:47:35,774
My ear hurts! 

1141
00:47:35,774 --> 00:47:36,795
No, it won’t hurt. 

1142
00:47:37,803 --> 00:47:39,419
(Goose bumps) 

1143
00:47:40,791 --> 00:47:43,27
(100% sincere) 

1144
00:47:43,847 --> 00:47:45,579
(The same expression) 

1145
00:47:46,636 --> 00:47:48,988
(We counted the kisses in 3 hours) 

1146
00:47:49,977 --> 00:47:52,28
(About 180 times) 

1147
00:47:52,28 --> 00:47:54,241
180 times. 

1148
00:47:55,825 --> 00:47:57,741
It's so funny. It's making me cry. 

1149
00:47:57,741 --> 00:47:59,209
What do you think? 

1150
00:48:00,357 --> 00:48:01,363
He kissed a lot. 

1151
00:48:01,363 --> 00:48:02,13
Right? 

1152
00:48:02,13 --> 00:48:03,442
Father, what do you think? 

1153
00:48:03,442 --> 00:48:05,219
How does it feel to see it for yourself? 

1154
00:48:05,219 --> 00:48:08,302
When did you film that… 

1155
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:11,70
What do you think? 

1156
00:48:11,70 --> 00:48:12,755
It must be a pain. 

1157
00:48:12,755 --> 00:48:14,113
Right? 

1158
00:48:14,113 --> 00:48:17,776
The friend. What do you think? 

1159
00:48:18,317 --> 00:48:20,965
It must be a real pain. 

1160
00:48:21,713 --> 00:48:23,413
(Now do you understand how I feel?) 

1161
00:48:24,766 --> 00:48:30,802
We had a guest who cried because 

1162
00:48:30,802 --> 00:48:33,34
she wanted to be loved by her dad. 

1163
00:48:33,34 --> 00:48:37,762
It's a bit too much, but he expresses it a lot. 

1164
00:48:37,762 --> 00:48:38,516
Which do you think is better? 

1165
00:48:38,516 --> 00:48:43,20
Sometimes, I want him to be indifferent. 

1166
00:48:43,20 --> 00:48:48,821
I liked a guy in the 2nd grade. 

1167
00:48:50,121 --> 00:48:50,533
And? 

1168
00:48:50,533 --> 00:48:52,890
I didn't do anything, but he got irritated 

1169
00:48:52,890 --> 00:48:54,54
and mad at me for no reason. 

1170
00:48:54,54 --> 00:48:55,343
He did? 

1171
00:48:55,343 --> 00:48:56,926
I didn't do anything. 

1172
00:48:56,927 --> 00:48:58,672
I wondered what was wrong with guys. 

1173
00:48:58,672 --> 00:49:01,545
I was going to ask my dad. 

1174
00:49:01,545 --> 00:49:05,944
I was going to talk to him, but he said okay 

1175
00:49:05,944 --> 00:49:07,528
and kissed me again. 

1176
00:49:07,528 --> 00:49:08,312
Before he listened to you? 

1177
00:49:08,312 --> 00:49:09,618
Instead of talking? 

1178
00:49:09,619 --> 00:49:15,719
I said he didn't understand and left. 

1179
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:17,698
He kept calling me. 

1180
00:49:17,698 --> 00:49:18,702
Asking you where you went? 

1181
00:49:18,702 --> 00:49:23,489
He told me to hurry back and kiss him. 

1182
00:49:23,489 --> 00:49:24,267
He didn't know how you felt. 

1183
00:49:24,267 --> 00:49:25,759
He's obsessed with kissing. 

1184
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:30,167
You should listen to her in such a situation, 

1185
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:32,156
not kiss her. 

1186
00:49:32,157 --> 00:49:35,921
I should comfort her with kissing. 

1187
00:49:37,424 --> 00:49:40,675
She went in her room and cried. 

1188
00:49:40,675 --> 00:49:43,910
That was pretty and cute, too. 

1189
00:49:43,910 --> 00:49:46,100
So I went and kissed her. 

1190
00:49:46,101 --> 00:49:49,797
I think it would be a serious concern for her. 

1191
00:49:49,797 --> 00:49:51,460
You only like kissing her. 

1192
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:57,265
You don't listen to her concerns. 

1193
00:49:59,21 --> 00:50:00,709
Why are you crying? 

1194
00:50:01,473 --> 00:50:05,372
It's a serious concern at her age. 

1195
00:50:05,372 --> 00:50:07,357
She had a boyfriend in the 2nd grade. 

1196
00:50:07,358 --> 00:50:09,382
It's a sensitive matter. 

1197
00:50:09,382 --> 00:50:11,101
You're guilty. 

1198
00:50:11,101 --> 00:50:13,146
Father is about to cry. 

1199
00:50:13,854 --> 00:50:15,703
(Emotional) 

1200
00:50:16,723 --> 00:50:21,107
Why are you both crying over this! 

1201
00:50:21,107 --> 00:50:23,44
You're putting us in a bind. 

1202
00:50:23,44 --> 00:50:31,854
If Sarang was mean, she'd get really mad, 

1203
00:50:31,854 --> 00:50:34,229
but she lets him do it. 

1204
00:50:34,229 --> 00:50:38,428
You should know that and refrain a bit. 

1205
00:50:38,429 --> 00:50:41,254
It's so funny. Mother is crying, too. 

1206
00:50:41,254 --> 00:50:46,812
The family is a mess because of kissing. 

1207
00:50:46,812 --> 00:50:54,98
When she gets a boyfriend, 

1208
00:50:54,98 --> 00:50:58,516
the boyfriend will be kissing her. 

1209
00:50:58,516 --> 00:51:00,496
That will be very upsetting. 

1210
00:51:00,496 --> 00:51:03,18
How would you feel if you saw them kiss? 

1211
00:51:03,18 --> 00:51:04,842
Uh… 

1212
00:51:04,842 --> 00:51:06,898
I never thought about it. 

1213
00:51:06,898 --> 00:51:08,550
Think about it now. 

1214
00:51:08,550 --> 00:51:10,686
I think I'll have to stick to her side 

1215
00:51:10,686 --> 00:51:14,261
around the clock. 

1216
00:51:14,261 --> 00:51:15,692
You can't do that. 

1217
00:51:15,693 --> 00:51:17,147
Aren't you going to let her get married? 

1218
00:51:17,147 --> 00:51:20,442
I should, but… 

1219
00:51:20,943 --> 00:51:22,892
Your older daughter wants to move out 

1220
00:51:22,892 --> 00:51:26,325
because you kiss her so much. 

1221
00:51:26,325 --> 00:51:27,718
She's enduring it until then. 

1222
00:51:27,718 --> 00:51:30,453
I think everyone will move out. 

1223
00:51:30,953 --> 00:51:32,581
(No…) 

1224
00:51:33,793 --> 00:51:36,121
Is there anything you want to say to your dad? 

1225
00:51:36,121 --> 00:51:41,946
We're close now, but if you kiss me when 

1226
00:51:41,946 --> 00:51:45,665
I'm going through puberty, we could be distanced. 

1227
00:51:45,666 --> 00:51:49,275
Until I go to middle school… Refrain. 

1228
00:51:49,275 --> 00:51:51,250
I love you. 

1229
00:51:52,411 --> 00:51:54,462
Dad is crying, too. 

1230
00:51:54,462 --> 00:51:57,69
What's going on? 

1231
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:59,834
(Everyone is in tears because of kissing) 

1232
00:51:59,834 --> 00:52:01,489
Sarang. 

1233
00:52:01,489 --> 00:52:03,557
You're tired of kissing. 

1234
00:52:03,557 --> 00:52:07,660
I guess you won't kiss your boyfriend later. 

1235
00:52:07,661 --> 00:52:09,621
I probably will once in a while. 

1236
00:52:10,227 --> 00:52:11,446
(Disturbed) 

1237
00:52:11,447 --> 00:52:12,774
Tell your dad you're going to kiss when 

1238
00:52:12,774 --> 00:52:15,182
you meet a man you love. 

1239
00:52:15,182 --> 00:52:18,185
When I find someone I like, 

1240
00:52:18,186 --> 00:52:22,738
we'll kiss and hug, so don't be surprised. 

1241
00:52:24,73 --> 00:52:28,846
I'll start preparing myself from now on. 

1242
00:52:28,847 --> 00:52:31,404
Let's hear from the guests. Hyesung. 

1243
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:35,178
I'll say it's a concern. 

1244
00:52:35,178 --> 00:52:36,337
From Sarang's point of view. 

1245
00:52:36,337 --> 00:52:37,471
K.Will. 

1246
00:52:37,992 --> 00:52:39,881
Gee… 

1247
00:52:40,393 --> 00:52:42,102
What is this? 

1248
00:52:42,102 --> 00:52:47,892
It's a concern. Father should change. 

1249
00:52:47,892 --> 00:52:50,160
There's no answer if you say 

1250
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:56,814
it's because you love her. 

1251
00:52:56,814 --> 00:53:00,163
Think of it from her position. 

1252
00:53:00,164 --> 00:53:01,45
Youngji. 

1253
00:53:01,45 --> 00:53:03,552
I think it's a concern. 

1254
00:53:03,552 --> 00:53:04,805
Ryeowook. 

1255
00:53:04,805 --> 00:53:07,212
It's not a concern. 

1256
00:53:07,213 --> 00:53:09,25
You're the only one with a different opinion. 

1257
00:53:09,25 --> 00:53:13,486
Would you like it if I kissed you all the time? 

1258
00:53:13,486 --> 00:53:14,953
It's a concern! 

1259
00:53:17,245 --> 00:53:23,153
Excessive kissing made a family cry. 

1260
00:53:23,153 --> 00:53:26,221
If you think it's a concern, press the button! 

1261
00:53:26,221 --> 00:53:28,965
(What does the audience think?) 

1262
00:53:30,882 --> 00:53:31,958
5. 

1263
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:33,118
4. 

1264
00:53:33,118 --> 00:53:34,127
3. 

1265
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:35,230
2. 

1266
00:53:35,230 --> 00:53:36,146
1. 

1267
00:53:36,146 --> 00:53:37,458
Stop! 

1268
00:53:37,458 --> 00:53:38,797
Father! 

1269
00:53:38,797 --> 00:53:41,74
Say something to your daughter. 

1270
00:53:41,74 --> 00:53:42,418
To Sarang. 

1271
00:53:42,418 --> 00:53:43,746
Sarang. 

1272
00:53:43,746 --> 00:53:48,870
I didn't know it was such a concern for you. 

1273
00:53:48,870 --> 00:53:54,89
I'll cut down just a bit, so you're not stressed. 

1274
00:53:54,90 --> 00:53:55,847
You won't kiss her just a bit? 

1275
00:53:55,847 --> 00:53:58,276
You'll only cut down just a bit? 

1276
00:53:58,276 --> 00:54:02,337
I'll control it, so you're not stressed. 

1277
00:54:02,338 --> 00:54:05,293
Accept it until then. I love you. 

1278
00:54:07,321 --> 00:54:08,808
Sarang, why are you crying more? 

1279
00:54:08,809 --> 00:54:10,611
You can tell he loves you, right? 

1280
00:54:10,611 --> 00:54:12,808
He didn't understand? 

1281
00:54:12,809 --> 00:54:14,120
What's wrong? 

1282
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:16,944
Do you regret coming on the show? 

1283
00:54:16,944 --> 00:54:19,884
It's not that. He does it because he loves me. 

1284
00:54:19,884 --> 00:54:21,988
I feel sorry. 

1285
00:54:23,446 --> 00:54:26,139
Then you regret coming on the show. 

1286
00:54:26,507 --> 00:54:28,91
What does that make us? 

1287
00:54:28,483 --> 00:54:31,119
We recorded for 2 hours. 

1288
00:54:32,379 --> 00:54:34,91
I said it was a concern. 

1289
00:54:34,91 --> 00:54:35,797
I wonder how many votes she got. 

1290
00:54:35,797 --> 00:54:37,753
It's a cute concern. 

1291
00:54:37,753 --> 00:54:39,494
Show us the result! 

1292
00:54:39,494 --> 00:54:41,514
(Here is the result) 

1293
00:54:42,225 --> 00:54:44,386
It's over 100. 

1294
00:54:44,386 --> 00:54:46,945
(It's three digits!) 

1295
00:54:47,801 --> 00:54:50,245
(Well?) 

1296
00:54:50,756 --> 00:54:51,473
124. 

1297
00:54:51,474 --> 00:54:52,911
That's a lot. 

1298
00:54:53,503 --> 00:54:54,728
(Eliminated) 

1299
00:54:55,623 --> 00:54:56,948
(Survives) 

1300
00:54:57,902 --> 00:55:00,255
'Woman Who Attracts Attention'. 

1301
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:02,395
It's from a woman in the 20's. 

1302
00:55:02,395 --> 00:55:06,692
Hello, I'm reporting my older sister. 

1303
00:55:06,692 --> 00:55:09,756
I'm too embarrassed to go out. 

1304
00:55:09,756 --> 00:55:12,208
Every morning… 

1305
00:55:14,617 --> 00:55:15,837
Hey! 

1306
00:55:15,837 --> 00:55:18,103
I have to go now. 

1307
00:55:18,103 --> 00:55:19,330
This family, too? 

1308
00:55:21,737 --> 00:55:23,195
Come out! 

1309
00:55:23,992 --> 00:55:28,531
"Mm, all, all…" 

1310
00:55:28,531 --> 00:55:29,764
Is she singing? 

1311
00:55:29,764 --> 00:55:32,400
I have to go! 

1312
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,442
"All, all, all." 

1313
00:55:34,442 --> 00:55:39,344
"All I have to give you is this song." 

1314
00:55:39,344 --> 00:55:41,803
That was the song? 

1315
00:55:42,288 --> 00:55:45,124
What was that? 

1316
00:55:45,124 --> 00:55:47,825
She sings for an hour or two in the bathroom 

1317
00:55:47,825 --> 00:55:49,515
every morning. 

1318
00:55:49,516 --> 00:55:54,573
I have to grab my stomach and wait. 

1319
00:55:54,573 --> 00:55:57,156
It's worse at night. 

1320
00:55:57,156 --> 00:56:00,165
"Every lonely night." 

1321
00:56:00,165 --> 00:56:03,257
"I don't want to think about you." 

1322
00:56:03,945 --> 00:56:05,690
Come on! 

1323
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:08,445
Let me sleep! 

1324
00:56:08,445 --> 00:56:11,56
"No!" 

1325
00:56:11,56 --> 00:56:17,603
She sings until 3 or 4. 

1326
00:56:17,603 --> 00:56:20,812
She sings all day. 

1327
00:56:20,812 --> 00:56:23,828
Even when she sees a stranger… 

1328
00:56:23,828 --> 00:56:31,471
"You were born to be loved." 

1329
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:34,759
Isn't she crazy? 

1330
00:56:34,759 --> 00:56:39,746
Someone stop her from singing so much. 

1331
00:56:41,60 --> 00:56:45,239
Singing like that to a stranger… 

1332
00:56:45,239 --> 00:56:46,400
Really. 

1333
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,188
Let's meet the sister. 

1334
00:56:48,188 --> 00:56:49,545
Come on out! 

1335
00:56:50,725 --> 00:56:52,83
Don't go! 

1336
00:56:53,621 --> 00:56:55,109
(Kim Seon) 

1337
00:56:56,224 --> 00:56:57,871
(He wants to forget the humiliation) 

1338
00:56:57,871 --> 00:56:59,460
(Why is this making me nervous?) 

1339
00:57:01,653 --> 00:57:03,111
They're reaching out at the same time. 

1340
00:57:03,111 --> 00:57:03,877
Well? 

1341
00:57:03,877 --> 00:57:06,384
(Whose hand will she hold?) 

1342
00:57:10,464 --> 00:57:11,668
(Crash) 

1343
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:14,484
(Her hand grazed K.Will's hand?) 

1344
00:57:14,485 --> 00:57:15,846
Excuse me. 

1345
00:57:17,685 --> 00:57:19,198
Ryeowook, good! 

1346
00:57:19,198 --> 00:57:20,873
What does that make me? 

1347
00:57:23,209 --> 00:57:25,69
(She tried to grab his hand to survive) 

1348
00:57:25,657 --> 00:57:28,156
He pulled her hand. 

1349
00:57:30,167 --> 00:57:31,895
Does your sister want to be a singer? 

1350
00:57:31,896 --> 00:57:35,801
No, she's in college. She's just like that. 

1351
00:57:35,801 --> 00:57:41,69
Everyone sits quietly on a bus. 

1352
00:57:41,69 --> 00:57:43,931
She has earphones and sings loud enough 

1353
00:57:43,931 --> 00:57:47,149
for everyone on the bus to hear. 

1354
00:57:47,149 --> 00:57:48,393
Everyone stares. 

1355
00:57:48,393 --> 00:57:51,44
When crossing the street, she stopped 

1356
00:57:51,44 --> 00:57:53,83
in front of a car's headlights. 

1357
00:57:53,83 --> 00:57:56,124
She started to dance. 

1358
00:57:56,124 --> 00:57:58,211
Thinking it was lighting? 

1359
00:57:58,211 --> 00:57:59,263
Headlights! 

1360
00:57:59,264 --> 00:58:01,98
It will be recorded on the black box. 

1361
00:58:01,98 --> 00:58:03,74
The driver must have been surprised. 

1362
00:58:03,74 --> 00:58:07,687
I know, but she didn't care. 

1363
00:58:07,687 --> 00:58:11,906
She walks up to strangers and sings. 

1364
00:58:11,907 --> 00:58:12,930
Why? All of a sudden? 

1365
00:58:12,930 --> 00:58:15,498
We were waiting to cross the street. 

1366
00:58:15,498 --> 00:58:19,981
She acted bored. She spread her arms out 

1367
00:58:19,981 --> 00:58:23,137
and started singing you were born to be loved. 

1368
00:58:23,137 --> 00:58:23,901
What was the person's expression? 

1369
00:58:23,901 --> 00:58:24,953
Dumbfounded. 

1370
00:58:24,953 --> 00:58:29,166
What were you doing when she sang to strangers 

1371
00:58:29,166 --> 00:58:30,134
and danced in front of a car? 

1372
00:58:30,134 --> 00:58:34,774
I was embarrassed. I stood far away. 

1373
00:58:34,774 --> 00:58:37,650
You can just ignore it and go your way. 

1374
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:41,991
She yells my name out loud and comes after me. 

1375
00:58:41,991 --> 00:58:43,900
Where are you going? 

1376
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:45,188
What is your age difference? 

1377
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:46,959
8 years. 

1378
00:58:46,959 --> 00:58:47,734
That's a lot. 

1379
00:58:47,735 --> 00:58:49,158
Does she pester you? 

1380
00:58:49,158 --> 00:58:50,377
Yes. 

1381
00:58:50,377 --> 00:58:52,413
Let's meet the sister full of excitement. 

1382
00:58:52,413 --> 00:58:54,310
Call her. 

1383
00:58:54,310 --> 00:58:55,886
Sis. 

1384
00:58:56,606 --> 00:58:58,654
- Hello. / - Hello. 

1385
00:59:00,89 --> 00:59:02,46
- Hello. / - Hello. 

1386
00:59:03,615 --> 00:59:04,685
She doesn't look it. 

1387
00:59:04,685 --> 00:59:06,302
She looks like the quiet type. 

1388
00:59:06,302 --> 00:59:08,630
She looks shy. 

1389
00:59:08,630 --> 00:59:10,846
It seems like the sister is lying. 

1390
00:59:10,846 --> 00:59:12,878
Did you really sing and dance on the street? 

1391
00:59:12,878 --> 00:59:14,207
Yes. 

1392
00:59:14,207 --> 00:59:16,62
Why did you do that? 

1393
00:59:16,62 --> 00:59:20,154
You only live once. I want to enjoy life. 

1394
00:59:20,154 --> 00:59:22,62
I envy you. 

1395
00:59:22,62 --> 00:59:25,754
That's why you danced in front of headlights? 

1396
00:59:25,754 --> 00:59:29,306
It was like lighting. 

1397
00:59:29,306 --> 00:59:32,179
I thought the men who were driving 

1398
00:59:32,179 --> 00:59:34,603
would be exhausted. 

1399
00:59:35,903 --> 00:59:40,58
I did it to make them laugh. 

1400
00:59:40,58 --> 00:59:42,611
It was dark in the car, so I couldn't see them. 

1401
00:59:43,343 --> 00:59:44,999
You thought they laughed and liked it? 

1402
00:59:44,999 --> 00:59:46,497
I think they would have liked it. 

1403
00:59:46,498 --> 00:59:48,298
If we're waiting at a red light 

1404
00:59:48,298 --> 00:59:51,214
and someone dances, it would be funny. 

1405
00:59:51,215 --> 00:59:53,860
I'd crack the horn. 

1406
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:59,250
Why did you sing to strangers? 

1407
00:59:59,250 --> 01:00:03,306
People passed and they weren't smiling. 

1408
01:00:03,306 --> 01:00:07,662
It was sad to see. 

1409
01:00:07,662 --> 01:00:12,192
You have the right to be loved. 

1410
01:00:12,192 --> 01:00:14,564
I wanted to tell them. 

1411
01:00:14,564 --> 01:00:16,870
How was their response? 

1412
01:00:16,870 --> 01:00:20,58
They looked at me like I was crazy. 

1413
01:00:20,59 --> 01:00:23,278
My sister drags me away. 

1414
01:00:23,278 --> 01:00:25,790
I can't see their faces well. 

1415
01:00:25,790 --> 01:00:29,663
I want to see their responses, but… 

1416
01:00:30,403 --> 01:00:33,665
(It would be better not to) 

1417
01:00:33,666 --> 01:00:37,222
It must be bad for her to drag you away. 

1418
01:00:37,222 --> 01:00:38,931
Can you show us up to the moment 

1419
01:00:38,931 --> 01:00:40,204
she drags you away? 

1420
01:00:40,204 --> 01:00:41,655
Yes. 

1421
01:00:41,655 --> 01:00:42,938
Come on out. 

1422
01:00:44,919 --> 01:00:45,939
(That's strange) 

1423
01:00:47,239 --> 01:00:49,251
Let's be sweethearts. 

1424
01:00:49,251 --> 01:00:49,783
Who? 

1425
01:00:49,783 --> 01:00:50,861
On the street. 

1426
01:00:50,861 --> 01:00:51,971
- Me? / - Yes. 

1427
01:00:51,971 --> 01:00:53,315
Okay. 

1428
01:00:54,639 --> 01:00:57,987
Wow, she must be really rich. 

1429
01:00:59,691 --> 01:01:00,803
Honey. 

1430
01:01:02,15 --> 01:01:03,962
We're a couple. We look happy. 

1431
01:01:03,963 --> 01:01:09,240
Point out someone who is frowning too much. 

1432
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:11,497
Who do you want to sing that song to? 

1433
01:01:12,250 --> 01:01:15,204
(The sister's song of love) 

1434
01:01:15,204 --> 01:01:18,784
(Who is the lucky person to be comforted?) 

1435
01:01:20,749 --> 01:01:27,216
'You were born to be loved.' 

1436
01:01:27,216 --> 01:01:29,491
Why does everyone choose me? 

1437
01:01:29,491 --> 01:01:31,124
I was picked last week, too. 

1438
01:01:31,124 --> 01:01:33,299
(Chanu is really lucky this year) 

1439
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:36,253
'In your life.' 

1440
01:01:36,253 --> 01:01:38,368
'You're loved.' 

1441
01:01:38,368 --> 01:01:39,601
I am. 

1442
01:01:39,601 --> 01:01:45,461
'You were born…' 

1443
01:01:45,461 --> 01:01:47,475
(Don't stop me) 

1444
01:01:47,475 --> 01:01:48,940
Is she crazy? 

1445
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:50,340
Is that how she sings? 

1446
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:51,108
Yes. 

1447
01:01:51,108 --> 01:01:53,505
- If she does that… / - It must be scary. 

1448
01:01:53,505 --> 01:01:54,859
The production staff works hard. 

1449
01:01:54,859 --> 01:01:57,215
Who do you want to sing that song to? 

1450
01:01:58,77 --> 01:01:59,660
(Found one) 

1451
01:02:01,116 --> 01:02:04,128
(You) 

1452
01:02:05,496 --> 01:02:07,835
(Smile, love) 

1453
01:02:08,831 --> 01:02:10,871
(Relaying love) 

1454
01:02:12,67 --> 01:02:13,867
(It's embarrassing, stop it) 

1455
01:02:14,699 --> 01:02:15,652
From the expression. 

1456
01:02:15,652 --> 01:02:17,187
Huh? 

1457
01:02:18,607 --> 01:02:20,575
(There's another one) 

1458
01:02:20,575 --> 01:02:21,549
She saw someone. 

1459
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:23,891
There's someone else to be loved. 

1460
01:02:23,891 --> 01:02:26,445
(The love messenger approaches) 

1461
01:02:28,846 --> 01:02:30,898
(A touch of love) 

1462
01:02:32,274 --> 01:02:34,238
(Hang in there) 

1463
01:02:35,882 --> 01:02:37,718
Please give a round of applause. 

1464
01:02:37,718 --> 01:02:39,214
(The work environment is tough today) 

1465
01:02:39,215 --> 01:02:40,238
She's really strange. 

1466
01:02:40,238 --> 01:02:41,602
That's amazing. 

1467
01:02:41,603 --> 01:02:43,846
Her intention is good. 

1468
01:02:43,846 --> 01:02:46,241
It would be scary if she suddenly did that. 

1469
01:02:46,241 --> 01:02:47,992
If you're on the street and… 

1470
01:02:47,992 --> 01:02:50,483
Did anyone ever sing with you? 

1471
01:02:50,483 --> 01:02:51,567
Yes. 

1472
01:02:51,567 --> 01:02:53,255
I was on the subway when I was in high school. 

1473
01:02:53,255 --> 01:02:55,126
It was so boring. 

1474
01:02:55,126 --> 01:02:58,881
A few elderly women were sitting. 

1475
01:02:58,881 --> 01:03:03,904
I walked over and said I'd sing a song. 

1476
01:03:03,905 --> 01:03:06,65
They said go ahead. 

1477
01:03:06,65 --> 01:03:09,386
A few elderly women came from the next car. 

1478
01:03:09,386 --> 01:03:12,162
Go ahead and sing. 

1479
01:03:12,162 --> 01:03:14,537
Okay, I'll sing a song. 

1480
01:03:14,537 --> 01:03:16,529
Okay. 

1481
01:03:18,758 --> 01:03:20,477
(Clap, clap, clap) 

1482
01:03:21,610 --> 01:03:22,988
(Here goes) 

1483
01:03:24,826 --> 01:03:28,142
'It's raining.' 

1484
01:03:28,142 --> 01:03:31,636
'The Honam Rail is headed south.' 

1485
01:03:31,637 --> 01:03:35,613
'Beyond the shaking window…' 

1486
01:03:35,613 --> 01:03:38,230
You're good. 

1487
01:03:38,230 --> 01:03:46,998
'My memory is vague.' 

1488
01:03:46,998 --> 01:03:49,997
(She did that on the subway?) 

1489
01:03:51,293 --> 01:03:53,37
(That's really amazing) 

1490
01:03:54,396 --> 01:03:55,746
(I want to hide) 

1491
01:03:55,746 --> 01:03:57,678
She's embarrassed. 

1492
01:03:58,467 --> 01:04:00,430
(Energy up!) 

1493
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:03,460
Hey! 

1494
01:04:03,460 --> 01:04:05,59
I have to get off here. 

1495
01:04:06,372 --> 01:04:08,283
Thank you. 

1496
01:04:08,620 --> 01:04:10,95
You're good. 

1497
01:04:10,95 --> 01:04:11,805
- The subway? / - Yes. 

1498
01:04:11,806 --> 01:04:14,552
Everyone stared, right? 

1499
01:04:14,552 --> 01:04:15,174
Yes. 

1500
01:04:15,174 --> 01:04:16,147
Weren't you embarrassed? 

1501
01:04:16,147 --> 01:04:18,474
Not at all. 

1502
01:04:18,474 --> 01:04:20,238
You have a lot of courage. 

1503
01:04:20,238 --> 01:04:21,384
That's amazing. 

1504
01:04:21,385 --> 01:04:22,913
I felt proud. 

1505
01:04:23,435 --> 01:04:27,203
They asked how I could enjoy life so much. 

1506
01:04:28,212 --> 01:04:35,456
But my sister says I'm too loud. 

1507
01:04:35,456 --> 01:04:40,840
I say people like it. 

1508
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:42,52
(That's what you think) 

1509
01:04:43,776 --> 01:04:44,937
She's very positive. 

1510
01:04:44,937 --> 01:04:45,493
Really. 

1511
01:04:45,493 --> 01:04:46,984
Can't you let it go? 

1512
01:04:46,984 --> 01:04:51,747
It's alright if she's like that herself, 

1513
01:04:51,747 --> 01:04:54,8
but she makes me sing with her. A cappella. 

1514
01:04:54,8 --> 01:04:57,765
She says she'll add harmony. 

1515
01:04:57,765 --> 01:05:00,350
On the street. 

1516
01:05:00,351 --> 01:05:02,477
Show us. 

1517
01:05:02,477 --> 01:05:06,712
Yes. Together. 

1518
01:05:06,713 --> 01:05:08,685
(Not again) 

1519
01:05:08,685 --> 01:05:11,296
It looks like they did that a lot. 

1520
01:05:11,296 --> 01:05:14,89
The number 7 bus in Gwangju. 

1521
01:05:14,90 --> 01:05:20,821
'All I can give you is this voice.' 

1522
01:05:20,821 --> 01:05:23,348
On the bus? 

1523
01:05:25,269 --> 01:05:28,694
(They're in harmony even if she's forced) 

1524
01:05:28,694 --> 01:05:30,653
She's into it. 

1525
01:05:31,23 --> 01:05:32,497
(It's funny because she's so sincere) 

1526
01:05:33,522 --> 01:05:35,890
(She has no soul, but she does as she's told) 

1527
01:05:39,238 --> 01:05:42,372
Don't the passengers get surprised? 

1528
01:05:42,372 --> 01:05:43,395
It's really embarrassing. 

1529
01:05:43,395 --> 01:05:44,758
Isn't it? 

1530
01:05:44,758 --> 01:05:49,26
I'm happy to sing with my sister. 

1531
01:05:49,27 --> 01:05:52,567
You like to add harmony. There are five of them. 

1532
01:05:52,567 --> 01:05:55,699
Choose a song and assign the parts. 

1533
01:05:56,249 --> 01:05:57,435
Can I come out? 

1534
01:05:57,435 --> 01:05:58,519
Do you want to? 

1535
01:05:59,150 --> 01:06:00,969
Isn't it embarrassing? 

1536
01:06:00,969 --> 01:06:02,826
Why would it be embarrassing? 

1537
01:06:02,826 --> 01:06:03,758
Okay, come on out. 

1538
01:06:03,758 --> 01:06:05,772
She doesn't get embarrassed. 

1539
01:06:08,33 --> 01:06:08,860
She has a pitch pipe. 

1540
01:06:08,860 --> 01:06:10,635
Sit here. 

1541
01:06:10,878 --> 01:06:13,20
She brought a pitch pipe to do it right. 

1542
01:06:13,20 --> 01:06:14,955
I always carry it around. 

1543
01:06:14,955 --> 01:06:16,167
All year. 

1544
01:06:16,167 --> 01:06:19,201
You're not a singer. Why? 

1545
01:06:19,201 --> 01:06:23,493
Don't sigh. 

1546
01:06:24,377 --> 01:06:25,773
Are you embarrassed? 

1547
01:06:25,773 --> 01:06:28,868
From "The Lion King" OST. 

1548
01:06:29,396 --> 01:06:32,309
(They challenge "The Lion Sleeps Tonight") 

1549
01:06:34,573 --> 01:06:35,366
(I'll assign the parts) 

1550
01:06:35,367 --> 01:06:36,154
Wimoweh. 

1551
01:06:36,154 --> 01:06:40,476
- Wimoweh. / - Wimoweh. 

1552
01:06:40,476 --> 01:06:42,212
Wimoweh. 

1553
01:06:42,212 --> 01:06:43,289
You have to sing it together. 

1554
01:06:44,37 --> 01:06:46,133
Altogether. 

1555
01:06:46,133 --> 01:06:48,189
(A really low tone) 

1556
01:06:48,746 --> 01:06:50,560
Oh! 

1557
01:06:54,609 --> 01:06:55,805
(He was complimented) 

1558
01:06:56,385 --> 01:06:59,740
In three parts. 

1559
01:07:00,408 --> 01:07:03,699
Wimoweh, wimoweh. 

1560
01:07:03,699 --> 01:07:05,42
What about the middle? 

1561
01:07:06,895 --> 01:07:09,18
Wimoweh, wimoweh. 

1562
01:07:09,18 --> 01:07:11,156
(The harmony becomes abundant) 

1563
01:07:11,156 --> 01:07:12,663
Why are we going along? 

1564
01:07:12,663 --> 01:07:13,899
(What's wrong with everyone?) 

1565
01:07:13,899 --> 01:07:15,28
This side. 

1566
01:07:15,428 --> 01:07:17,421
(The left side) 

1567
01:07:19,30 --> 01:07:21,293
(It's too high) 

1568
01:07:22,265 --> 01:07:24,419
Let's try it now. Keep going. 

1569
01:07:24,419 --> 01:07:26,774
One, two, three, four. 

1570
01:07:30,539 --> 01:07:32,779
(Happy) 

1571
01:07:34,719 --> 01:07:36,923
(Everyone becomes one with music) 

1572
01:07:36,923 --> 01:07:40,323
(This is why she does it) 

1573
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:42,249
One more time. 

1574
01:07:43,884 --> 01:07:44,967
(She's really excited) 

1575
01:07:46,107 --> 01:07:47,792
(Do it all today and stop) 

1576
01:07:50,451 --> 01:07:51,502
Okay, that's it. 

1577
01:07:51,502 --> 01:07:53,702
(The improv a cappella was successful) 

1578
01:07:54,342 --> 01:07:56,192
She's good. 

1579
01:07:56,192 --> 01:07:58,943
She's not a recreation instructor, is she? 

1580
01:07:58,943 --> 01:08:00,118
No, she's not. 

1581
01:08:00,118 --> 01:08:02,118
Will you take this? 

1582
01:08:03,191 --> 01:08:04,430
I wonder what her job is. 

1583
01:08:04,431 --> 01:08:05,996
(She's still excited) 

1584
01:08:08,64 --> 01:08:10,20
(One more time?) 

1585
01:08:10,20 --> 01:08:12,442
(I'm happy to) 

1586
01:08:14,708 --> 01:08:15,852
(What will I do with her?) 

1587
01:08:16,871 --> 01:08:18,583
I'm really excited right now. 

1588
01:08:18,582 --> 01:08:20,147
Because we all sang with you? 

1589
01:08:20,147 --> 01:08:20,805
Yes. 

1590
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:22,834
Did your wish come true? 

1591
01:08:22,834 --> 01:08:25,590
No, I want to do more. 

1592
01:08:26,166 --> 01:08:27,27
(She's greedy) 

1593
01:08:27,916 --> 01:08:31,500
Not all sisters do what they're told. 

1594
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:33,670
Some don’t know matter what. 

1595
01:08:33,670 --> 01:08:36,937
You must listen to her a lot. 

1596
01:08:36,937 --> 01:08:42,334
I give her allowance when she's in need. 

1597
01:08:42,334 --> 01:08:43,377
(Unbelievable) 

1598
01:08:44,78 --> 01:08:46,559
I guess you could do it if she pays you. 

1599
01:08:46,559 --> 01:08:49,95
She gave you allowance. 

1600
01:08:49,95 --> 01:08:53,187
She makes me do voice imitations. 

1601
01:08:53,187 --> 01:08:54,837
There's a price. 

1602
01:08:55,374 --> 01:08:58,325
Who do you have to imitate? 

1603
01:08:59,356 --> 01:09:00,118
There's something. 

1604
01:09:00,118 --> 01:09:03,982
Kim Yeonghui in 'Last Love'. 

1605
01:09:07,118 --> 01:09:09,710
(To get allowance) 

1606
01:09:09,711 --> 01:09:11,395
(How is she at voice imitations?) 

1607
01:09:12,118 --> 01:09:15,866
Oh! 

1608
01:09:20,122 --> 01:09:21,542
(It's hard to make money) 

1609
01:09:22,858 --> 01:09:23,587
(She's cute) 

1610
01:09:23,587 --> 01:09:25,757
She's not like this. 

1611
01:09:25,756 --> 01:09:27,136
How much does she give you if you do that? 

1612
01:09:27,136 --> 01:09:30,456
$5 at most. 

1613
01:09:31,73 --> 01:09:32,969
(It's not even a lot of money!) 

1614
01:09:32,969 --> 01:09:34,600
That's not true. 

1615
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:36,41
You take more. 

1616
01:09:36,42 --> 01:09:39,57
Sure, I take a bit more. 

1617
01:09:39,57 --> 01:09:40,684
She tempts me with money. 

1618
01:09:40,685 --> 01:09:46,106
If I say no, she gets mad until I do it. 

1619
01:09:46,106 --> 01:09:51,626
What's really hard for you? 

1620
01:09:51,626 --> 01:09:54,954
She imitates instruments with her voice. 

1621
01:09:54,954 --> 01:09:57,633
She's practicing the haegeum, 

1622
01:09:57,633 --> 01:10:00,374
trumpet and harmonica. 

1623
01:10:00,374 --> 01:10:04,38
I made a deal with her. 

1624
01:10:04,38 --> 01:10:07,271
She's Chanu's fan. 

1625
01:10:07,971 --> 01:10:09,821
That's why she sang to him earlier. 

1626
01:10:11,694 --> 01:10:13,978
(Fatal) 

1627
01:10:14,442 --> 01:10:15,473
If Chanu says she's not good, 

1628
01:10:15,473 --> 01:10:18,305
she promised to stop imitating instruments. 

1629
01:10:18,305 --> 01:10:19,793
- If I say she's not good? / - Yes. 

1630
01:10:19,793 --> 01:10:22,293
Are you really going to stop if I say so? 

1631
01:10:22,293 --> 01:10:24,691
Yes. 

1632
01:10:24,691 --> 01:10:25,922
I swear. 

1633
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:27,835
What will you do first? 

1634
01:10:27,836 --> 01:10:29,894
The haegeum. 

1635
01:10:30,857 --> 01:10:31,781
(I'll listen) 

1636
01:10:38,89 --> 01:10:40,650
(The haegeum is a bit…) 

1637
01:10:42,342 --> 01:10:43,821
Don't do it. 

1638
01:10:44,154 --> 01:10:45,86
(How can this be?) 

1639
01:10:45,86 --> 01:10:47,2
Don't do it. 

1640
01:10:47,2 --> 01:10:48,415
(That's it for the haegeum) 

1641
01:10:49,57 --> 01:10:50,829
Anyone can do that! 

1642
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:53,997
(That's what I'm saying) 

1643
01:10:53,997 --> 01:10:55,69
And? 

1644
01:10:55,69 --> 01:10:56,616
The haegeum isn't that good. 

1645
01:10:56,616 --> 01:10:58,372
The trumpet. 

1646
01:10:59,17 --> 01:11:01,277
(With her life on the line) 

1647
01:11:01,277 --> 01:11:03,593
(I have to make this good) 

1648
01:11:09,35 --> 01:11:10,639
(It's much better than the haegeum) 

1649
01:11:12,271 --> 01:11:13,343
(Aren't I good?) 

1650
01:11:18,375 --> 01:11:20,472
(We can do that, too) 

1651
01:11:22,208 --> 01:11:25,175
(Please don't imitate the trumpet) 

1652
01:11:25,776 --> 01:11:27,154
Chanu, what do you think? 

1653
01:11:29,494 --> 01:11:30,790
Don't do it. 

1654
01:11:32,54 --> 01:11:33,103
Last. 

1655
01:11:33,103 --> 01:11:34,269
What you're practicing these days. The harmonica. 

1656
01:11:34,269 --> 01:11:35,913
Anyone can do that much. 

1657
01:11:35,913 --> 01:11:37,17
The harmonica. 

1658
01:11:37,17 --> 01:11:38,983
Hold this, mom. 

1659
01:11:38,983 --> 01:11:40,635
Mom does what she's told. 

1660
01:11:40,635 --> 01:11:44,69
I blushed following along. 

1661
01:11:44,69 --> 01:11:46,646
(Will she be able to continue doing the harmonica?) 

1662
01:11:49,10 --> 01:11:51,351
(Did it go in water?) 

1663
01:11:52,744 --> 01:11:54,150
Don't do it. 

1664
01:11:54,456 --> 01:11:56,31
Don't do any of them. 

1665
01:11:57,367 --> 01:12:00,657
It's not even 1% similar at all? 

1666
01:12:00,657 --> 01:12:02,432
It's not similar. 

1667
01:12:02,432 --> 01:12:03,916
Okay. 

1668
01:12:03,916 --> 01:12:06,390
It could be fun if you do it once in a while, 

1669
01:12:06,390 --> 01:12:09,5
but it's torture if you keep doing it. 

1670
01:12:09,5 --> 01:12:11,294
She was told. 

1671
01:12:11,294 --> 01:12:13,236
She won't imitate instruments anymore. 

1672
01:12:13,236 --> 01:12:15,59
You'll keep your promise, right? 

1673
01:12:15,60 --> 01:12:16,751
Ah… 

1674
01:12:16,751 --> 01:12:20,634
You said you'd stop if Chanu said it wasn't good. 

1675
01:12:20,634 --> 01:12:23,310
It's alright if she doesn't hear it, right? 

1676
01:12:23,310 --> 01:12:26,708
I'll do it to the dog. 

1677
01:12:26,708 --> 01:12:28,556
What did the dog do to deserve that? 

1678
01:12:28,556 --> 01:12:31,233
Your problem is solved if she doesn't 

1679
01:12:31,234 --> 01:12:32,799
imitate instruments, right? 

1680
01:12:32,799 --> 01:12:36,785
There's one more concern. 

1681
01:12:36,785 --> 01:12:39,789
We were walking in an alley. 

1682
01:12:39,789 --> 01:12:41,697
There were some scary men. 

1683
01:12:41,697 --> 01:12:44,715
I said we should hurry past them. 

1684
01:12:44,715 --> 01:12:47,755
But she sang again. 

1685
01:12:47,755 --> 01:12:51,974
I'm worried she'll get into trouble 

1686
01:12:51,974 --> 01:12:52,970
if she does that when she's by herself. 

1687
01:12:52,970 --> 01:12:56,630
Even the scary men would be scared if 

1688
01:12:56,630 --> 01:12:58,631
someone sang like that. 

1689
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:02,256
(It would be better to avoid her) 

1690
01:13:02,672 --> 01:13:04,844
I think it would be really scary. 

1691
01:13:04,845 --> 01:13:06,513
It's scarier if you let it show. 

1692
01:13:06,513 --> 01:13:10,632
They’ll know you're afraid of them. 

1693
01:13:10,632 --> 01:13:12,679
It's less scary if I sing. 

1694
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:15,49
That's why I sing more. 

1695
01:13:15,49 --> 01:13:18,236
She's really worried. 

1696
01:13:18,236 --> 01:13:21,715
Shouldn't you refrain a bit? 

1697
01:13:21,716 --> 01:13:26,749
When I have a baby, I want to sing in harmony 

1698
01:13:26,749 --> 01:13:30,962
with my husband and my children. 

1699
01:13:30,962 --> 01:13:34,178
It would be nice to meet someone who likes that. 

1700
01:13:34,178 --> 01:13:36,806
You can be happy by yourself. 

1701
01:13:36,806 --> 01:13:38,384
Can't you leave your family alone? 

1702
01:13:38,384 --> 01:13:40,933
We just grew close recently. 

1703
01:13:40,933 --> 01:13:45,814
We grew closer singing and dancing. 

1704
01:13:45,814 --> 01:13:49,826
I wanted to do it with her. 

1705
01:13:49,826 --> 01:13:55,197
That's true, but there are places to sing. 

1706
01:13:55,197 --> 01:14:01,453
I'd like her to distinguish that, but she doesn't. 

1707
01:14:01,453 --> 01:14:05,70
I want to walk along silently on the street 

1708
01:14:05,70 --> 01:14:07,541
like other sisters. 

1709
01:14:07,542 --> 01:14:12,458
When I say I don't want to, don't make me. 

1710
01:14:15,87 --> 01:14:16,981
Let's start with Hyesung. Is it a concern? 

1711
01:14:16,981 --> 01:14:19,89
I don't think it's a concern. 

1712
01:14:19,89 --> 01:14:20,889
I don't think it's a concern either. 

1713
01:14:20,889 --> 01:14:23,385
I don't think it's a concern. 

1714
01:14:23,385 --> 01:14:25,161
I think it's a concern. 

1715
01:14:25,161 --> 01:14:27,895
He keeps saying the opposite. 

1716
01:14:27,895 --> 01:14:28,998
He gives an opposite opinion. 

1717
01:14:28,998 --> 01:14:31,928
It's not a serious concern, 

1718
01:14:31,929 --> 01:14:33,710
but it's a concern for the sister. 

1719
01:14:33,710 --> 01:14:36,574
If you think it's a concern, press the button! 

1720
01:14:36,574 --> 01:14:39,5
(What does the audience think?) 

1721
01:14:39,778 --> 01:14:40,746
5. 

1722
01:14:40,746 --> 01:14:41,906
4. 

1723
01:14:41,906 --> 01:14:43,42
3. 

1724
01:14:43,42 --> 01:14:44,273
2. 

1725
01:14:44,273 --> 01:14:45,193
1. 

1726
01:14:45,193 --> 01:14:46,488
Stop! 

1727
01:14:46,488 --> 01:14:50,376
Is there anything you want to say to your sister? 

1728
01:14:50,376 --> 01:14:54,205
I didn't know you were that stressed. I'm sorry. 

1729
01:14:54,205 --> 01:15:00,839
I love you a lot. I think I was selfish. 

1730
01:15:00,839 --> 01:15:02,267
I'm going to cry. 

1731
01:15:02,267 --> 01:15:03,584
Again? 

1732
01:15:03,584 --> 01:15:05,388
Why is everyone crying today? 

1733
01:15:05,388 --> 01:15:09,715
She feels sorry it's a concern for her sister. 

1734
01:15:09,715 --> 01:15:13,211
Sing with me at home. 

1735
01:15:13,211 --> 01:15:16,364
I'll try to refrain outside. 

1736
01:15:18,652 --> 01:15:20,184
Show us the result! 

1737
01:15:22,948 --> 01:15:23,756
7! 

1738
01:15:23,756 --> 01:15:27,680
It's not over 100 from the sound of the beeps. 

1739
01:15:28,851 --> 01:15:30,169
67! 

1740
01:15:31,660 --> 01:15:32,985
(Eliminated) 

1741
01:15:32,985 --> 01:15:37,362
'Lifetime Enemy' wins a second time! 

1742
01:15:37,867 --> 01:15:40,259
She wins a prize worth $1,000. 

1743
01:15:40,259 --> 01:15:41,293
(Congratulations) 

1744
01:15:41,612 --> 01:15:44,630
Until the day Korea has no more concerns, 

1745
01:15:44,630 --> 01:15:46,242
"Hello Counselor" is here to help. 

1746
01:15:46,242 --> 01:15:47,678
Thank you! 

1747
01:15:50,165 --> 01:15:55,165
("Rough" / GFRIEND)
