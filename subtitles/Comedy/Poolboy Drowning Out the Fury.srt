1
00:02:08,989 --> 00:02:10,456
Wait, wait, wait.

2
00:02:10,457 --> 00:02:12,792
No. Come on.

3
00:02:12,793 --> 00:02:15,996
Let's go, you said you would.

4
00:02:21,835 --> 00:02:23,770
Come on, I'm gonna make you like nature.

5
00:02:23,771 --> 00:02:25,973
I don't think nature likes me very much.

6
00:02:41,588 --> 00:02:44,957
All I'm saying is you don't get
fresh air like this in New York.

7
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:47,394
Okay. Sure, whatever.

8
00:02:48,729 --> 00:02:50,897
All right, you wanna go back?

9
00:02:50,898 --> 00:02:51,864
What?

10
00:02:51,865 --> 00:02:53,333
To the house, not the city.

11
00:02:59,372 --> 00:03:00,708
Is he going to...

12
00:03:03,476 --> 00:03:04,778
What?

13
00:03:07,147 --> 00:03:08,248
Tom!

14
00:03:10,517 --> 00:03:11,418
Tom!

15
00:03:27,234 --> 00:03:29,069
Tom!

16
00:03:35,275 --> 00:03:36,409
Tom!

17
00:04:14,915 --> 00:04:17,284
Here, here. I'm gonna...

18
00:04:19,252 --> 00:04:20,353
He's not breathing.

19
00:04:31,298 --> 00:04:32,564
I'm gonna call someone.

20
00:04:32,565 --> 00:04:33,800
All right, I'll go.

21
00:04:33,801 --> 00:04:35,201
- I'll go.
- No, no, stay.

22
00:04:35,202 --> 00:04:36,303
I got it, I got it.

23
00:04:41,441 --> 00:04:42,442
Breathe.

24
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:19,912
I think this needs stitches.

25
00:05:19,913 --> 00:05:21,780
Doesn't need stitches.
Just... just put that on.

26
00:05:21,781 --> 00:05:22,982
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

27
00:05:22,983 --> 00:05:24,884
Do they even teach shrinks that?

28
00:05:24,885 --> 00:05:26,752
You'd be surprised
what they teach shrinks.

29
00:05:26,753 --> 00:05:28,088
Just put that...

30
00:05:29,256 --> 00:05:30,390
Just put...

31
00:05:31,491 --> 00:05:32,791
- Ow!
- Oh, sorry, sorry.

32
00:05:32,792 --> 00:05:34,226
No, I'm just kidding.
It didn't hurt.

33
00:05:34,227 --> 00:05:35,929
Oh.

34
00:05:52,312 --> 00:05:53,580
Do you wanna...?

35
00:06:05,592 --> 00:06:07,094
You all right?

36
00:06:08,361 --> 00:06:09,829
Yeah, yeah. I just...

37
00:06:11,899 --> 00:06:13,132
Just that kid.

38
00:06:13,133 --> 00:06:15,302
I know. It was touch-and-go.

39
00:06:19,006 --> 00:06:21,840
You risked your life for
a complete stranger.

40
00:06:21,841 --> 00:06:23,576
It's not like I had a choice.

41
00:06:28,715 --> 00:06:30,716
Look...

42
00:06:30,717 --> 00:06:34,086
If I wasn't such a fantastic swimmer,

43
00:06:34,087 --> 00:06:36,322
then I wouldn't have gone in, but I am.

44
00:06:36,323 --> 00:06:38,125
And, anyway, I'm all right, right?

45
00:07:09,722 --> 00:07:11,191
Thanks.

46
00:07:12,792 --> 00:07:14,995
Look, what you did was very brave.

47
00:07:16,296 --> 00:07:18,164
I just got scared. That's all.

48
00:07:18,165 --> 00:07:19,132
I know.

49
00:07:21,634 --> 00:07:22,969
I'll take that to the cleaners.

50
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:24,203
It's his, actually.

51
00:07:24,204 --> 00:07:26,138
Paramedics must have
grabbed the wrong one.

52
00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:28,140
I was gonna stop by the hos...

53
00:07:28,141 --> 00:07:30,576
Oh, hey, hey, hey.
It's okay.

54
00:07:30,577 --> 00:07:32,312
It's okay, it's okay.

55
00:07:46,359 --> 00:07:48,127
Hey, Mary.

56
00:07:48,128 --> 00:07:51,697
They were about to admit a
Dr. Thomas Seymour before I noticed.

57
00:07:51,698 --> 00:07:53,165
Ian Wilkinson.

58
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:54,866
You get a read on him?

59
00:07:54,867 --> 00:07:57,336
No. Temazepam in his veins,
maybe 10 of 'em.

60
00:07:57,337 --> 00:07:58,137
Oh, Jesus.

61
00:07:58,138 --> 00:07:59,372
Yeah, Mary and Joseph.

62
00:08:05,812 --> 00:08:07,446
Hello.

63
00:08:07,447 --> 00:08:09,949
I thought you might be looking for this.

64
00:08:11,718 --> 00:08:13,119
I'm the, uh...

65
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,187
I'm the guy that pulled you out.

66
00:08:15,188 --> 00:08:17,889
My wife was pretty shook up,
so she'll be happy to know...

67
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:19,359
Dr. Seymour?

68
00:08:22,795 --> 00:08:24,964
It's, uh... it's me.

69
00:08:27,434 --> 00:08:28,967
Danny?

70
00:08:28,968 --> 00:08:30,236
Danny Miller?

71
00:08:30,237 --> 00:08:31,138
Yeah.

72
00:08:32,772 --> 00:08:36,308
Wow, I'm sorry. I... I didn't know
that you were, uh, out.

73
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:38,710
They kept it pretty quiet.

74
00:08:38,711 --> 00:08:40,012
Right.

75
00:08:40,013 --> 00:08:42,814
So I... Ian, um...

76
00:08:42,815 --> 00:08:46,285
Oh, uh, Ian was the warden's first name,

77
00:08:46,286 --> 00:08:48,087
Wilkinson was the chaplain's last,

78
00:08:48,088 --> 00:08:50,856
so that's me now.

79
00:08:50,857 --> 00:08:53,625
What has it been, 10, 12 years?

80
00:08:53,626 --> 00:08:54,860
Really?

81
00:08:54,861 --> 00:08:56,662
It feels like twice that for me.

82
00:08:56,663 --> 00:08:58,065
Oh, of course, of course.

83
00:09:00,033 --> 00:09:01,100
I'm sorry.

84
00:09:01,101 --> 00:09:02,301
This is... it's...

85
00:09:02,302 --> 00:09:04,170
Wild, right?

86
00:09:04,171 --> 00:09:06,072
It makes you think, huh?

87
00:09:06,073 --> 00:09:07,439
Yeah, it does.

88
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,475
Chaplain would say that, uh, coincidence

89
00:09:09,476 --> 00:09:12,944
is the crack in human affairs
that lets God in.

90
00:09:12,945 --> 00:09:14,480
A chaplain would.

91
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,951
Well, look, um, I gotta...

92
00:09:19,952 --> 00:09:22,954
I gotta get to work,
so all things considered,

93
00:09:22,955 --> 00:09:25,057
you... you look all right.

94
00:09:25,058 --> 00:09:26,792
Yeah. Yeah.

95
00:09:26,793 --> 00:09:28,361
All things considered.

96
00:09:29,929 --> 00:09:31,164
You take care.

97
00:09:57,424 --> 00:09:59,791
'Cause my mother's a bitch, 'cause
she didn't believe that he raped me.

98
00:09:59,792 --> 00:10:01,519
The bitch said...
You know what she said?

99
00:10:01,521 --> 00:10:02,094
Young lady!

100
00:10:02,095 --> 00:10:04,230
She said I made it up.
Fuck her.

101
00:10:04,231 --> 00:10:06,365
Her man gets two years,
two years probation,

102
00:10:06,366 --> 00:10:08,767
and she blames me, takes it out on me.

103
00:10:08,768 --> 00:10:10,402
Bitch killed my dog.

104
00:10:10,403 --> 00:10:13,038
She killed my fucking dog, that's why.

105
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:14,506
I cut her, the bitch.

106
00:10:14,507 --> 00:10:16,108
Showed her some fucking
justice across her face.

107
00:10:16,109 --> 00:10:17,609
That is enough, Miss Demers.

108
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:20,680
Will counsel and the psychologist
please approach?

109
00:10:22,682 --> 00:10:24,251
Dr. Seymour.

110
00:10:30,623 --> 00:10:32,459
So, what do you think?

111
00:10:41,401 --> 00:10:43,802
I'm... I'm so sick of that case.

112
00:10:43,803 --> 00:10:45,537
"My dog. My dog. My dog."

113
00:10:45,538 --> 00:10:47,506
You really think the mother's
boyfriend raped her?

114
00:10:47,507 --> 00:10:49,141
I'm gonna violate him anyways,

115
00:10:49,142 --> 00:10:50,442
before she kills him.

116
00:10:50,443 --> 00:10:52,278
Kids usually need a reason
to kill somebody.

117
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:54,746
Not in that neighborhood.
Bought you a drink.

118
00:10:54,747 --> 00:10:56,482
Why, thank you.

119
00:10:56,483 --> 00:10:59,017
Ian Wilkinson.

120
00:10:59,018 --> 00:11:00,452
He's one of yours?

121
00:11:00,453 --> 00:11:03,156
Yeah, and you did a good thing.

122
00:11:04,491 --> 00:11:06,192
Were you ever gonna tell me?

123
00:11:06,193 --> 00:11:07,594
You know I couldn't.

124
00:11:10,062 --> 00:11:11,730
Do the police know it's him?

125
00:11:11,731 --> 00:11:12,998
I took care of that.

126
00:11:12,999 --> 00:11:16,268
He was off his meds, he's depressed,
went for a swim.

127
00:11:16,269 --> 00:11:17,903
A swim? Angie, Danny is...

128
00:11:17,904 --> 00:11:20,506
He's Ian Wilkinson now, okay?

129
00:11:20,507 --> 00:11:22,374
Yeah, when did we start doing that?

130
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:24,710
We do it every once in a while.

131
00:11:24,711 --> 00:11:27,112
He's a very exceptional...
"Exceptional."

132
00:11:27,113 --> 00:11:28,647
And damaged young man.

133
00:11:28,648 --> 00:11:29,681
Mm-hmm.

134
00:11:29,682 --> 00:11:31,049
Smart, bright.

135
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:32,484
He has a chance,

136
00:11:32,485 --> 00:11:36,456
a future if we keep the police
and the press out of it.

137
00:11:37,957 --> 00:11:39,259
He thinks you can help him.

138
00:11:40,527 --> 00:11:42,561
Well, you know that's not gonna happen.

139
00:11:42,562 --> 00:11:45,765
And you can't tell anyone
about this, not even your wife.

140
00:11:46,933 --> 00:11:49,000
Have your drink, Tom.

141
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:50,936
You earned it.

142
00:11:50,937 --> 00:11:52,639
That water was deep.

143
00:11:54,207 --> 00:11:56,141
I gotta get back to court

144
00:11:56,142 --> 00:11:57,810
and least look like I'm working.

145
00:11:59,312 --> 00:12:00,413
Think about it.

146
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,441
So you're back Thursday, then?

147
00:13:02,442 --> 00:13:06,612
No, no. I told you I'm filling in
for Bob this weekend.

148
00:13:06,613 --> 00:13:08,347
You've been cutting down
on your hours, so...

149
00:13:08,348 --> 00:13:10,282
- Yeah, I know. Sorry.
- ...we could use the cash.

150
00:13:10,283 --> 00:13:11,283
You should come down.

151
00:13:11,284 --> 00:13:12,384
- This weekend?
- Yeah.

152
00:13:12,385 --> 00:13:14,252
Is there an opening or something?

153
00:13:14,253 --> 00:13:16,655
No. No, it's just...
Because I just gotta

154
00:13:16,656 --> 00:13:18,223
finish this chapter on parental abuse,

155
00:13:18,224 --> 00:13:20,326
and I haven't listened
to the tapes yet, so...

156
00:13:20,327 --> 00:13:22,595
No, it's just it's a good time.

157
00:13:23,696 --> 00:13:24,597
I got it.

158
00:13:25,932 --> 00:13:27,499
I hate talking about it this way.

159
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,301
- No, I get it.
- Really, I'm sick of it,

160
00:13:29,302 --> 00:13:31,537
the calendars, the thermometers.

161
00:13:31,538 --> 00:13:34,039
Hey, listen.
No, I... I want that.

162
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,841
I do. I want it.

163
00:13:35,842 --> 00:13:38,510
Whatever it takes.

164
00:13:38,511 --> 00:13:39,911
As many times as it takes.

165
00:13:39,912 --> 00:13:41,613
- Okay.
- I'm your man.

166
00:13:41,614 --> 00:13:43,382
I'm gonna try and finish up
here in the next few days

167
00:13:43,383 --> 00:13:44,817
and get down there, okay?

168
00:14:01,401 --> 00:14:03,335
You know what?
I'm gonna drive you down.

169
00:14:03,336 --> 00:14:05,937
We'll stop at a B&B and
get right down to it.

170
00:14:05,938 --> 00:14:07,873
Stop. It's fine.

171
00:14:07,874 --> 00:14:10,108
Just finish whatever it is
you need to finish,

172
00:14:10,109 --> 00:14:11,977
but try to come down, okay?

173
00:14:11,978 --> 00:14:13,912
You're beautiful.
You know that?

174
00:14:55,488 --> 00:14:56,755
It's too easy to assume

175
00:14:56,756 --> 00:14:58,924
that Nicole simply lacks conscience.

176
00:14:58,925 --> 00:15:02,093
Many children are obsessed with
issues of loyalty and betrayal,

177
00:15:02,094 --> 00:15:04,463
but hers is a...

178
00:15:04,464 --> 00:15:06,097
Primitive and exacting.

179
00:15:06,098 --> 00:15:08,600
So the question then becomes
how to distinguish

180
00:15:08,601 --> 00:15:11,503
between access to a personality disorder

181
00:15:11,504 --> 00:15:13,038
and relatively healthy...

182
00:15:24,016 --> 00:15:27,152
Danny. What are you...
What are you doing here?

183
00:15:27,153 --> 00:15:29,154
Hey. I was just in the neighborhood,

184
00:15:29,155 --> 00:15:31,122
and, uh, you left your letter,

185
00:15:31,123 --> 00:15:32,724
uh, at the hospital the other day.

186
00:15:32,725 --> 00:15:34,159
It has your address on it.

187
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,827
You didn't hear the doorbell?

188
00:15:35,828 --> 00:15:37,696
- Mm-mmm.
- Anyway, it looked important,

189
00:15:37,697 --> 00:15:39,364
like a bill or something.

190
00:15:39,365 --> 00:15:41,434
Oh. Well, thank you.

191
00:15:42,802 --> 00:15:46,037
You look a bit better.
How you feeling?

192
00:15:46,038 --> 00:15:48,740
Well, I got out of the hospital,
and I slept like the dead.

193
00:15:48,741 --> 00:15:52,811
Okay. Well, uh, thanks for this,

194
00:15:52,812 --> 00:15:56,114
and, uh, I gotta get back to work, so...

195
00:15:56,115 --> 00:15:59,050
What?

196
00:15:59,051 --> 00:16:02,955
You're the only person
I can talk to about what happened.

197
00:16:06,358 --> 00:16:08,027
Can I come in?

198
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,263
- Uh, sure.
- Yeah, thank you.

199
00:16:12,264 --> 00:16:13,599
Yeah, of course.
I just...

200
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,134
Just h-have a seat.
I'll...

201
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:24,910
Look, Danny, I can give you
the name of someone else

202
00:16:24,911 --> 00:16:26,444
who can help...
What are you doing?

203
00:16:26,445 --> 00:16:30,348
What... please don't smoke in here.

204
00:16:30,349 --> 00:16:32,951
Someone else, huh?

205
00:16:32,952 --> 00:16:35,320
I'm the knife that's
been cast into the sea.

206
00:16:35,321 --> 00:16:36,454
Excuse me?

207
00:16:36,455 --> 00:16:37,589
Sigmund Freud, Doc.

208
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:38,924
No, I know who wrote it,

209
00:16:38,925 --> 00:16:40,291
but I wouldn't categorize you that way.

210
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:41,794
Now please put the cigarette out.

211
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:45,296
I just want you to know that...

212
00:16:45,297 --> 00:16:46,798
- No, Danny, stop.
- Can we just...

213
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:48,634
Please, we cannot do this.
I'm not your therapist.

214
00:16:48,635 --> 00:16:50,201
Can we at least talk for a second?

215
00:16:50,202 --> 00:16:52,203
No!
I'm sorry.

216
00:16:52,204 --> 00:16:53,840
Jesus.

217
00:16:57,176 --> 00:17:01,847
They convicted me for a crime
that I didn't commit, and you...

218
00:17:01,848 --> 00:17:05,117
You basically sentenced me, so...

219
00:17:07,554 --> 00:17:11,089
Can you at least help me
get my life back on track?

220
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:13,024
I rendered an opinion.

221
00:17:13,025 --> 00:17:14,092
That's all.

222
00:17:14,093 --> 00:17:16,629
You know that I'm innocent.

223
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:19,731
You gotta know that, right?

224
00:17:19,732 --> 00:17:21,099
I actually don't know that,

225
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,068
and I need to ask you
to leave my house right now.

226
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:24,936
Do you understand me?

227
00:17:24,937 --> 00:17:26,205
Now.

228
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:31,943
What the fuck?

229
00:17:36,448 --> 00:17:37,717
What the hell?

230
00:18:06,445 --> 00:18:08,079
Hey, Louis.

231
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,114
- Whah!
- Whoa.

232
00:18:09,115 --> 00:18:11,116
Gotcha.

233
00:18:11,117 --> 00:18:13,284
Really?

234
00:18:13,285 --> 00:18:14,419
Good jab.

235
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,822
See you, Louis.

236
00:18:26,032 --> 00:18:27,398
Hey, Mom.

237
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:28,701
I'm in here.

238
00:18:31,771 --> 00:18:33,605
Louis tried to talk to you out there?

239
00:18:33,606 --> 00:18:34,906
Ah, you could say that, yeah.

240
00:18:34,907 --> 00:18:36,842
He keeps coming in here on his breaks,

241
00:18:36,843 --> 00:18:38,777
talking and talking about the past.

242
00:18:38,778 --> 00:18:41,346
It's very depressing.
I'm at a point I'm...

243
00:18:41,347 --> 00:18:44,515
I'm ready to go downtown and
hire a Mexican or something.

244
00:18:44,516 --> 00:18:45,684
Mom, what...

245
00:18:45,685 --> 00:18:47,518
Where's my daughter-in-law?

246
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:49,020
She's in New York.

247
00:18:49,021 --> 00:18:51,222
Oh, in the old days, it was the...

248
00:18:51,223 --> 00:18:53,291
It was the men who went
on the business trips.

249
00:18:53,292 --> 00:18:54,660
Mom, don't start with this.

250
00:18:54,661 --> 00:18:56,662
Even if it's always
the women who do the work.

251
00:18:56,663 --> 00:18:58,664
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait a sec.

252
00:18:58,665 --> 00:19:00,966
What did... what'd you do to your wrist?

253
00:19:00,967 --> 00:19:03,034
I just... I slipped a-and fell.

254
00:19:03,035 --> 00:19:04,936
Look, I'm really sorry
I can't stay for dinner,

255
00:19:04,937 --> 00:19:06,471
but you sure I can't make you something?

256
00:19:06,472 --> 00:19:09,107
Oh, for goodness sakes,
I can still take care of myself.

257
00:19:09,108 --> 00:19:11,743
I know you... okay.
Thank you for getting my groceries.

258
00:19:11,744 --> 00:19:13,712
I love you.

259
00:19:13,713 --> 00:19:16,215
Okay. Okay, buddy.
Bye-bye.

260
00:19:18,117 --> 00:19:20,986
My advice to you... a little
less thinking, a little more fucking.

261
00:19:20,987 --> 00:19:22,654
I mean, look at me.
I got the four kids,

262
00:19:22,655 --> 00:19:23,822
and let me tell you something.

263
00:19:23,823 --> 00:19:25,757
That did not happen from thinking.

264
00:19:25,758 --> 00:19:26,858
Mm. And three wives.

265
00:19:26,859 --> 00:19:28,827
Defense rests.
What about you?

266
00:19:28,828 --> 00:19:31,129
You're looking more distracted
and morose than usual.

267
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:31,930
What's that about?

268
00:19:31,931 --> 00:19:34,065
You remember Danny Miller?

269
00:19:34,066 --> 00:19:35,366
I just got a chill.

270
00:19:35,367 --> 00:19:36,702
I ran into him.

271
00:19:36,703 --> 00:19:38,569
He's out under another name.

272
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:40,138
And not a patient of yours, is he?

273
00:19:40,139 --> 00:19:41,807
No.
Well, good.

274
00:19:41,808 --> 00:19:43,709
Then stop working on what you're
working on and write that.

275
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:45,276
You could sell that in a second.

276
00:19:45,277 --> 00:19:48,747
There is nothing creepier
than the truth, right?

277
00:19:48,748 --> 00:19:51,049
Joke.
For God's sake, it was a joke.

278
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:53,251
Just don't talk to him
in any circumstances.

279
00:19:53,252 --> 00:19:54,385
That was a long time ago.

280
00:19:54,386 --> 00:19:56,054
Let that be a long time ago.

281
00:19:56,055 --> 00:19:58,323
Yeah, he's implying it was
my testimony that convicted him.

282
00:19:58,324 --> 00:20:01,592
Well, that's a little overstated,
don't you think?

283
00:20:01,593 --> 00:20:04,662
I mean, come on.
I know he was no angel.

284
00:20:04,663 --> 00:20:06,865
But still, it bothers me.

285
00:20:06,866 --> 00:20:09,234
He was my last case
on that side of things.

286
00:20:09,235 --> 00:20:11,737
When I think about it,

287
00:20:11,738 --> 00:20:12,971
maybe we did go too fast.

288
00:20:12,972 --> 00:20:14,873
Maybe we came at him a little too hard.

289
00:20:14,874 --> 00:20:17,108
What... what are you talking about?
He didn't deny being there.

290
00:20:17,109 --> 00:20:19,644
He admitted to putting the cushion
on her face, to touching her.

291
00:20:19,645 --> 00:20:22,547
Yeah, but he didn't have any of
the old lady's skin under his fingers,

292
00:20:22,548 --> 00:20:23,815
so there was nothing conclusive.

293
00:20:23,816 --> 00:20:25,083
Nothing conclusive?
His goddamn fingerprints

294
00:20:25,084 --> 00:20:26,752
were all over the bedroom, Teddy!

295
00:20:26,753 --> 00:20:29,187
Easy, tough guy.
Holy cow.

296
00:20:30,122 --> 00:20:31,790
You know, if we continue like this,

297
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:33,591
I'm gonna have to start
billing somebody, anybody.

298
00:20:33,592 --> 00:20:35,626
Yeah, and the chickens...
I don't want to hear about the chickens.

299
00:20:35,627 --> 00:20:37,996
For God's sake.

300
00:20:37,997 --> 00:20:40,799
The fact of the matter is
you did the right thing.

301
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,402
You did, and there's
always gonna be questions.

302
00:20:44,403 --> 00:20:46,571
I got one for you.

303
00:20:46,572 --> 00:20:49,540
Do you think he honestly ran across you,

304
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:50,976
or do you think he found you?

305
00:20:50,977 --> 00:20:52,944
He insists it was random.

306
00:20:52,945 --> 00:20:55,180
Like anything's fucking random.

307
00:20:55,181 --> 00:20:56,614
I tell you what.

308
00:20:56,615 --> 00:20:58,249
If you need a weapon,
I'll get you a gun.

309
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,090
What is wrong with you?
What is wrong with you?

310
00:21:02,188 --> 00:21:05,290
Thank God they still make
reporters that look like that.

311
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:06,192
Wowee.

312
00:21:33,385 --> 00:21:34,853
Hey.
Honey, is that you?

313
00:21:34,854 --> 00:21:37,322
It's Angela.

314
00:21:37,323 --> 00:21:39,290
Ange? What?

315
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:40,525
Ian.

316
00:21:40,526 --> 00:21:41,692
Ian?

317
00:21:41,693 --> 00:21:43,128
Ian Wilkinson turned up

318
00:21:43,129 --> 00:21:44,896
at Morgan Hamilton Penitentiary tonight

319
00:21:44,897 --> 00:21:46,932
trying to get himself re-incarcerated.

320
00:21:46,933 --> 00:21:49,300
Tried to handcuff himself to a guard.

321
00:21:49,301 --> 00:21:50,469
They want to commit him.

322
00:21:52,604 --> 00:21:54,305
Well, maybe they should.

323
00:21:54,306 --> 00:21:56,741
They want to commit him
unless his parole officer

324
00:21:56,742 --> 00:21:58,544
or his therapist comes and gets him.

325
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:02,680
Okay. I'm not his therapist, so what...

326
00:22:02,681 --> 00:22:04,216
That's not what he told them.

327
00:22:05,751 --> 00:22:07,185
I can't get over there tonight.

328
00:22:07,186 --> 00:22:09,054
Please help me out on this.

329
00:22:10,056 --> 00:22:12,157
See, you... you gotta be kidding me.

330
00:22:12,158 --> 00:22:14,861
Tom, like it or not,
you're part of this.

331
00:22:17,796 --> 00:22:18,796
I gotta go.

332
00:22:23,002 --> 00:22:24,136
Fuck.

333
00:23:17,656 --> 00:23:19,958
Hey, pull over to the side of the road.

334
00:23:19,959 --> 00:23:21,327
I gotta take a leak.

335
00:23:23,329 --> 00:23:25,364
Yeah. Okay.

336
00:25:03,829 --> 00:25:06,297
I'm sorry.
You all right?

337
00:25:06,298 --> 00:25:07,565
Yeah.

338
00:25:07,566 --> 00:25:08,634
I'm fine.

339
00:25:10,269 --> 00:25:12,038
You know what?
Give me a drag of that.

340
00:25:20,879 --> 00:25:22,414
Thought maybe you ran off.

341
00:25:23,815 --> 00:25:25,551
Yeah, well, maybe.

342
00:25:36,428 --> 00:25:38,464
Do you remember our last session?

343
00:25:40,266 --> 00:25:42,501
The session before my trial?

344
00:25:44,703 --> 00:25:46,804
I put my arms around your waist,

345
00:25:46,805 --> 00:25:48,473
and you looked at me.

346
00:25:50,342 --> 00:25:52,243
You looked at me, and you walked away,

347
00:25:52,244 --> 00:25:54,011
and I never heard from you again,

348
00:25:54,012 --> 00:25:55,414
I never saw you again.

349
00:25:58,284 --> 00:26:00,252
I was 11 years old, Tom.

350
00:26:06,492 --> 00:26:10,128
Okay. Well, um... you're out now.

351
00:26:10,129 --> 00:26:11,363
You're here.

352
00:26:13,365 --> 00:26:15,467
Do me a favor.
Crack the window, will you?

353
00:26:27,446 --> 00:26:31,649
There's no smoking in my office, okay?

354
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:33,252
Ever.

355
00:26:45,464 --> 00:26:50,469
I started, uh, burning
my fingertips in prison.

356
00:26:51,637 --> 00:26:53,172
I don't know why I do it.

357
00:26:54,873 --> 00:26:57,108
It's clean in here, very chic,

358
00:26:57,109 --> 00:26:59,345
like a... a hotel.

359
00:27:00,746 --> 00:27:03,581
Safe, nice...

360
00:27:03,582 --> 00:27:05,717
No distractions.

361
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:09,920
Hmm, no distractions.

362
00:27:09,921 --> 00:27:12,190
Now, is that why
you tried to get yourself

363
00:27:12,191 --> 00:27:13,625
back into prison last night?

364
00:27:15,194 --> 00:27:17,696
Yeah. Yeah, and I jumped
in the river to cool down.

365
00:27:20,732 --> 00:27:22,200
You still taking the Temazepam?

366
00:27:22,201 --> 00:27:24,835
Yep, 20 milligrams.

367
00:27:24,836 --> 00:27:25,836
Where you living?

368
00:27:25,837 --> 00:27:27,037
Some shithole.

369
00:27:27,038 --> 00:27:28,374
You got a job?

370
00:27:29,808 --> 00:27:31,609
The marina.

371
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:32,643
Anybody at home?

372
00:27:32,644 --> 00:27:33,644
Nope.

373
00:27:33,645 --> 00:27:35,012
What about your mom?

374
00:27:35,013 --> 00:27:36,415
Dead.

375
00:27:37,783 --> 00:27:39,317
I'm sorry.

376
00:27:39,318 --> 00:27:42,787
They let me visit her in the
hospital with the cuffs on.

377
00:27:42,788 --> 00:27:45,690
You know what killed my mother?
Those fucking handcuffs.

378
00:27:45,691 --> 00:27:50,261
And my father wasn't even
fucking there when she went.

379
00:27:50,262 --> 00:27:52,096
And, uh, he's in Norwich now,

380
00:27:52,097 --> 00:27:54,565
in some narcissistic
coma he calls a bar.

381
00:27:54,566 --> 00:27:56,534
He used to visit me at Windsor,

382
00:27:56,535 --> 00:27:59,069
acted like I was at
some fancy prep school,

383
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:02,174
but when they take you to prison...

384
00:28:04,376 --> 00:28:07,713
Well, you turn 18,
you know your life is over.

385
00:28:09,215 --> 00:28:11,282
Look, I want you to know that I had

386
00:28:11,283 --> 00:28:13,083
no idea that you went to prison then.

387
00:28:13,084 --> 00:28:14,452
Don't lie, Dr. Seymour.

388
00:28:14,453 --> 00:28:15,820
I'm not lying.
It's the truth.

389
00:28:15,821 --> 00:28:17,021
That's bullshit!

390
00:28:17,022 --> 00:28:18,289
Danny, it's not bullshit.
Listen...

391
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:19,724
Fucking sorry.
That's great.

392
00:28:19,725 --> 00:28:21,492
That gets me my fucking
life back, doesn't it?

393
00:28:21,493 --> 00:28:23,461
I didn't do it.
I didn't do it, and you know that.

394
00:28:23,462 --> 00:28:25,129
Come on, do you really believe that?

395
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:27,233
The forensic evidence was overwhelming.

396
00:28:34,606 --> 00:28:35,641
Time's up.

397
00:30:09,835 --> 00:30:11,802
You know...

398
00:30:11,803 --> 00:30:15,072
You could open your eyes
when we're doing it.

399
00:30:15,073 --> 00:30:17,207
Oh, jeez, I'm sorry, honey.

400
00:30:17,208 --> 00:30:19,243
The book is work.

401
00:30:19,244 --> 00:30:21,278
This is supposed to be the fun part.

402
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:23,113
No, I... I know.
You're right. I just...

403
00:30:23,114 --> 00:30:25,082
You should have come down.

404
00:30:25,083 --> 00:30:28,319
I know. I know.
I know it's a good time for us to try...

405
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,790
No. No, because it was fun.

406
00:30:33,024 --> 00:30:34,860
Because New York is fun.

407
00:30:36,528 --> 00:30:38,363
New London is cloudy.

408
00:30:38,364 --> 00:30:40,130
Hey, wait.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

409
00:30:40,131 --> 00:30:41,766
Hang on there.
Hang on there.

410
00:30:41,767 --> 00:30:43,634
Wait a second.

411
00:30:43,635 --> 00:30:45,370
Maybe I just get a little jealous

412
00:30:45,371 --> 00:30:47,572
seeing you with all these
young artist types, huh?

413
00:30:47,573 --> 00:30:50,140
Oh-ho.

414
00:30:50,141 --> 00:30:52,276
Thomas Seymour jealous.

415
00:30:52,277 --> 00:30:53,479
That, I like.

416
00:31:48,734 --> 00:31:49,935
Oh.

417
00:31:52,303 --> 00:31:53,337
You all right?

418
00:31:53,338 --> 00:31:56,507
Um, my mind's just racing.

419
00:31:56,508 --> 00:31:58,376
It's okay.
Go back to sleep.

420
00:32:29,007 --> 00:32:31,175
Oh.

421
00:32:51,396 --> 00:32:52,698
It's lopsided...

422
00:32:54,733 --> 00:32:56,601
Well, yeah, now that
I'm talking about it.

423
00:32:56,602 --> 00:32:59,570
Hey, honey, you moving out
on me one painting at a time?

424
00:32:59,571 --> 00:33:01,806
She's got a show.

425
00:33:01,807 --> 00:33:04,875
We ran into each other
at Pete's, by the river.

426
00:33:04,876 --> 00:33:08,513
It's Ian, Tom.
You remember?

427
00:33:08,514 --> 00:33:10,616
Yeah, o-of course, of course.

428
00:33:11,717 --> 00:33:13,751
How are you, Ian?
How you doing?

429
00:33:13,752 --> 00:33:15,319
Good.
We've been talking,

430
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,954
and he's thinking
of applying to schools.

431
00:33:16,955 --> 00:33:18,856
I said that we could call around.

432
00:33:18,857 --> 00:33:21,025
Sure. Sure, that... that sounds great.

433
00:33:21,026 --> 00:33:22,426
What's this show that you...

434
00:33:22,427 --> 00:33:23,861
Oh, no, it's nothing.
It's...

435
00:33:23,862 --> 00:33:25,596
Bob called me at the last minute

436
00:33:25,597 --> 00:33:27,965
and had to cancel, so I said
I'd put something up.

437
00:33:27,966 --> 00:33:29,767
That's great, right?
Isn't that great?

438
00:33:29,768 --> 00:33:31,335
Oh, no, yeah, it's definitely great.

439
00:33:31,336 --> 00:33:32,803
It's not MOMA.
It's not nothing, though.

440
00:33:32,804 --> 00:33:34,271
It's just a faculty show.

441
00:33:34,272 --> 00:33:35,706
Yeah, no, I think...
I think it's great.

442
00:33:35,707 --> 00:33:37,609
I'll definitely come down for it, hon.

443
00:33:39,911 --> 00:33:41,445
Ian works the night shift at the marina,

444
00:33:41,446 --> 00:33:43,113
so I said I'd give him a ride home.

445
00:33:43,114 --> 00:33:44,314
You know what?
I... I'll take him.

446
00:33:44,315 --> 00:33:45,883
Don't you have to go to court today?

447
00:33:45,884 --> 00:33:47,351
I do, but I can drop him off.

448
00:33:47,352 --> 00:33:49,720
It's right on the way.
Oh, okay. Great.

449
00:33:49,721 --> 00:33:52,823
I... I have to get back
to the city, and...

450
00:33:52,824 --> 00:33:53,858
It's crazy!

451
00:33:53,859 --> 00:33:54,993
It is.

452
00:33:59,865 --> 00:34:02,668
I prefer to drink out of a real cup.

453
00:34:07,606 --> 00:34:09,674
So that's where I work,

454
00:34:09,675 --> 00:34:11,677
and that's where I drink.

455
00:34:15,046 --> 00:34:16,281
So, no kids, huh?

456
00:34:17,916 --> 00:34:19,316
Nope.
Hmm.

457
00:34:19,317 --> 00:34:22,386
'Cause sometimes I wonder
why my parents even bothered.

458
00:34:22,387 --> 00:34:24,856
What were they looking for, you know?

459
00:34:28,326 --> 00:34:30,896
Your dad really doesn't want
to see you at all, huh?

460
00:34:33,098 --> 00:34:35,332
My dad wants to erase me.

461
00:34:35,333 --> 00:34:38,168
He never wanted to see me, not really.

462
00:34:38,169 --> 00:34:39,637
He had the garage.

463
00:34:39,638 --> 00:34:41,338
He fixed it up like a workshop,

464
00:34:41,339 --> 00:34:43,007
put a lock and key on it,

465
00:34:43,008 --> 00:34:46,244
but he'd just sit there
and talk Fallujah, mostly.

466
00:34:47,478 --> 00:34:49,413
He told me the story about he...

467
00:34:49,414 --> 00:34:51,548
He blew a hole in this guy's chest,

468
00:34:51,549 --> 00:34:54,720
and he slid down the wall
like a red glob of spit.

469
00:34:55,854 --> 00:34:57,988
No, my dad, he just liked to hunt.

470
00:34:57,989 --> 00:34:59,323
I hated it.

471
00:34:59,324 --> 00:35:02,426
One time, maybe I was six...

472
00:35:02,427 --> 00:35:04,061
He just pulled over
to the side of the road,

473
00:35:04,062 --> 00:35:05,596
grabbed an automatic out of the back,

474
00:35:05,597 --> 00:35:07,464
and shot six deer in seconds,

475
00:35:07,465 --> 00:35:08,799
like we were in an ambush.

476
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,320
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop!

477
00:35:11,536 --> 00:35:13,804
I was right beside him.

478
00:35:13,805 --> 00:35:16,373
They were so beautiful up close.

479
00:35:16,374 --> 00:35:17,975
He made me shoot one of them in the head

480
00:35:17,976 --> 00:35:20,845
so it wouldn't keep on trying to get up.

481
00:35:20,846 --> 00:35:23,380
I don't know if it was
the adrenaline or not,

482
00:35:23,381 --> 00:35:25,951
but I... I couldn't stop crying.

483
00:35:28,654 --> 00:35:31,255
With the blood s-splattering in my face.

484
00:35:31,256 --> 00:35:33,692
My dad saw it.
Oh, he was pissed.

485
00:35:36,394 --> 00:35:38,263
Just keep on going straight, man.

486
00:35:40,431 --> 00:35:41,932
You know, I read somewhere

487
00:35:41,933 --> 00:35:44,769
that we only use 10%
of our mental capacity.

488
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:46,303
You think about that?

489
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:48,139
Yes, as a matter of fact.

490
00:35:51,076 --> 00:35:54,979
It's like buying a suit that's
too big for you, you know.

491
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:57,648
Like maybe one day, you're gonna fit it.

492
00:35:57,649 --> 00:36:01,318
Hmm. Then what do you
think the other 90% is?

493
00:36:01,319 --> 00:36:03,287
I don't know.

494
00:36:03,288 --> 00:36:05,690
Maybe it's animal, you know?

495
00:36:05,691 --> 00:36:09,960
Like, if we don't have
this tiny, little fraction,

496
00:36:09,961 --> 00:36:13,230
we're just all animal-like,

497
00:36:13,231 --> 00:36:14,598
like when we're sleeping

498
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:16,867
or when I was in the river.

499
00:36:16,868 --> 00:36:19,905
No thinking, just animal.

500
00:36:21,606 --> 00:36:24,909
Did you use CPR to revive me?

501
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:26,076
Yeah.

502
00:36:26,077 --> 00:36:27,345
It wasn't your wife?

503
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,848
Why are you asking?

504
00:36:30,849 --> 00:36:33,918
Nothing.
I'm just curious, you know?

505
00:36:33,919 --> 00:36:36,353
I mean, your wife, she...
She's a very nice lady.

506
00:36:36,354 --> 00:36:37,554
Mm-hmm.
Very sweet.

507
00:36:37,555 --> 00:36:39,389
You're lucky.
She's hot.

508
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:41,025
- Hey, hey.
- Sorry.

509
00:36:41,026 --> 00:36:44,229
Hey, uh, that's me right there,
that hunk of shit.

510
00:36:48,934 --> 00:36:50,234
Hey, good-looking.

511
00:36:50,235 --> 00:36:51,401
Ah.

512
00:36:51,402 --> 00:36:54,438
Why don't you set your bags down,
and I'll help you take them up.

513
00:36:54,439 --> 00:36:56,907
Oh, you're a prince, Ian.

514
00:36:56,908 --> 00:36:58,208
Thanks.

515
00:36:58,209 --> 00:37:00,678
You need to stop coming to my house.
Do you understand?

516
00:37:01,747 --> 00:37:04,983
Listen, I want to help you,
but if you don't stop, we're done.

517
00:37:06,752 --> 00:37:08,418
You're hurting me, Dr. Seymour.

518
00:37:08,419 --> 00:37:09,721
Do you understand?

519
00:37:17,428 --> 00:37:20,098
Ah, thank you, sweetheart.

520
00:37:22,868 --> 00:37:25,535
You are in violation of
your supervised release.

521
00:37:25,536 --> 00:37:28,438
You have the right to retain
counsel or to request counsel.

522
00:37:28,439 --> 00:37:30,307
If you cannot obtain it
through ordinary means,

523
00:37:30,308 --> 00:37:32,709
the court will appoint someone to you.

524
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:34,179
Do you understand?

525
00:37:35,646 --> 00:37:37,948
He tried to rape his 13-year-old niece.

526
00:37:37,949 --> 00:37:39,449
You were right about him.

527
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:41,418
Ugh.
Does Nikki know?

528
00:37:41,419 --> 00:37:42,953
Probably.

529
00:37:42,954 --> 00:37:45,389
Thank God she was in prison.

530
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:47,959
Can't believe how often
I'm saying that these days.

531
00:37:50,128 --> 00:37:51,295
And Ian?

532
00:37:51,296 --> 00:37:52,629
Yeah?

533
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:55,532
Have you been talking to him?

534
00:37:55,533 --> 00:37:57,567
You sent me to go get him, remember?

535
00:37:57,568 --> 00:37:59,636
Yes, and thank you.

536
00:37:59,637 --> 00:38:01,339
After that?

537
00:38:04,309 --> 00:38:05,310
What is it?

538
00:38:06,945 --> 00:38:08,914
Did he say anything about me?

539
00:38:10,315 --> 00:38:13,017
Because, uh, we were...

540
00:38:13,018 --> 00:38:15,752
We have been speaking every night.

541
00:38:15,753 --> 00:38:20,257
These talks are deep.

542
00:38:20,258 --> 00:38:23,894
But lately, he's been a little quick,

543
00:38:23,895 --> 00:38:25,362
distant almost.

544
00:38:25,363 --> 00:38:27,764
I... I don't know if I said
anything to upset him.

545
00:38:27,765 --> 00:38:29,834
Angela, he's your parolee.

546
00:38:29,835 --> 00:38:31,035
No, I know that...

547
00:38:31,036 --> 00:38:33,037
And how did he get out?

548
00:38:33,038 --> 00:38:36,573
The headmaster at Windsor
really went to bat for him,

549
00:38:36,574 --> 00:38:39,277
cashed in some favors, and so did I.

550
00:38:41,046 --> 00:38:42,746
So, he hasn't mentioned me?

551
00:38:42,747 --> 00:38:44,381
Angela, Angela, look at me.

552
00:38:44,382 --> 00:38:45,983
What's going on?

553
00:38:45,984 --> 00:38:47,551
What?

554
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:49,954
He's a job, a case.
He's your case.

555
00:38:49,955 --> 00:38:51,923
I'm... I'm worried about him.

556
00:38:52,858 --> 00:38:53,891
He's a good kid.

557
00:38:53,892 --> 00:38:55,492
Yeah? How can you be so sure?

558
00:38:55,493 --> 00:38:58,528
Tom, how many of these cases
do we see every day?

559
00:38:58,529 --> 00:39:00,565
This kid is...

560
00:39:01,666 --> 00:39:02,868
He's special.

561
00:39:04,069 --> 00:39:06,536
I think he has a real shot.

562
00:39:06,537 --> 00:39:07,704
You think I'm wrong?

563
00:39:07,705 --> 00:39:09,406
I don't know.

564
00:39:09,407 --> 00:39:10,508
I don't know what I think.

565
00:39:56,654 --> 00:39:59,189
He would make me hold
a chicken in my hands,

566
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:01,926
you know, after... after he came back.

567
00:40:01,927 --> 00:40:05,029
He was different, scary.

568
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:08,032
He would, you know, tie my hands to it

569
00:40:08,033 --> 00:40:10,034
and then cut off its head.

570
00:40:10,035 --> 00:40:12,269
I would hold it while it shook

571
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:14,339
and the bleeding came all out.

572
00:40:16,507 --> 00:40:18,943
And you understand that's wrong?

573
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:20,511
That that's...

574
00:40:21,846 --> 00:40:23,713
You're safe here, Danny.

575
00:40:23,714 --> 00:40:25,316
You understand that?

576
00:41:04,789 --> 00:41:05,922
Mrs. Green?

577
00:41:05,923 --> 00:41:07,958
Yes. Dr. Seymour, please come in.

578
00:41:07,959 --> 00:41:09,160
Thank you.

579
00:41:11,662 --> 00:41:14,664
You're better-looking than
the picture on your book.

580
00:41:14,665 --> 00:41:16,466
No, thank you.

581
00:41:16,467 --> 00:41:19,069
I... I appreciate you
seeing me on such short notice.

582
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:20,270
Oh, it's my pleasure.

583
00:41:20,271 --> 00:41:23,507
I'm not sure I can tell you anything.

584
00:41:23,508 --> 00:41:25,076
Are you treating Danny?

585
00:41:26,477 --> 00:41:27,877
Yes.

586
00:41:27,878 --> 00:41:29,546
Yes, I am.

587
00:41:29,547 --> 00:41:31,681
So, you used to teach him
here at Windsor.

588
00:41:31,682 --> 00:41:35,485
Yes. He was one of the
brightest boys I ever taught.

589
00:41:35,486 --> 00:41:38,022
Yeah, there's... there's nothing
like feeding a mind

590
00:41:38,023 --> 00:41:39,923
that could take everything
you can give it

591
00:41:39,924 --> 00:41:41,558
and then comes back asking for more.

592
00:41:41,559 --> 00:41:43,327
And how old was he then?

593
00:41:43,328 --> 00:41:45,163
13 and 14.

594
00:41:47,598 --> 00:41:51,235
Is there anything else
from that time that...

595
00:41:51,236 --> 00:41:53,504
Struck you about him that sticks out?

596
00:41:54,739 --> 00:41:56,640
He was very good at getting people

597
00:41:56,641 --> 00:41:58,142
to think they were helping him

598
00:41:58,143 --> 00:42:01,178
until they ended up exhausted or worse.

599
00:42:01,179 --> 00:42:03,513
Three of our staffers, to be exact.

600
00:42:03,514 --> 00:42:07,352
You know, my husband
still blames himself.

601
00:42:08,819 --> 00:42:10,054
What he did to that child.

602
00:42:10,055 --> 00:42:11,855
Oh, yes.
Yes, that's...

603
00:42:11,856 --> 00:42:13,957
That was terrible, terrible,

604
00:42:13,958 --> 00:42:15,492
and I know very difficult to talk about.

605
00:42:15,493 --> 00:42:19,929
I'm sorry.
I... I blame Mr. McDonald.

606
00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:22,666
You see, I still want to forgive Danny,

607
00:42:22,667 --> 00:42:24,068
because the other boy,

608
00:42:24,069 --> 00:42:25,969
he was one of those boys,

609
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:28,038
always a problem, always.

610
00:42:28,039 --> 00:42:31,008
But Danny did...

611
00:42:33,078 --> 00:42:35,479
He stabbed that boy.

612
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:39,049
He walked across the room,
and he stabbed him.

613
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:41,051
Thank God the poor child survived.

614
00:42:41,052 --> 00:42:42,620
Broke my husband's heart.

615
00:42:44,889 --> 00:42:47,057
But I blame Angus.

616
00:42:47,058 --> 00:42:49,093
Do you see?
Mm-hmm.

617
00:42:49,094 --> 00:42:51,095
Because you feel like he let it happen?

618
00:42:51,096 --> 00:42:54,499
Wanted.
He wanted it to happen.

619
00:42:57,168 --> 00:43:01,171
Angus McDonald came
to us a teacher, a teacher,

620
00:43:01,172 --> 00:43:04,408
but he had Danny writing
all these terrible things

621
00:43:04,409 --> 00:43:06,810
over and over about what happened.

622
00:43:06,811 --> 00:43:10,680
Angus was over-involved.

623
00:43:11,949 --> 00:43:13,218
Go on.

624
00:43:14,285 --> 00:43:16,186
I think I've said enough.

625
00:43:23,428 --> 00:43:25,729
This is Tom.
You've reached my cell.

626
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:28,398
Leave me a message, and I'll
get back to you as soon as I can.

627
00:43:28,399 --> 00:43:30,134
Tom, I'm really mad at you right now,

628
00:43:30,135 --> 00:43:31,668
and I don't want to be mad at you,

629
00:43:31,669 --> 00:43:33,170
but you should be here.

630
00:43:33,171 --> 00:43:35,505
I shouldn't even be
leaving you this message.

631
00:43:35,506 --> 00:43:37,974
But this is good.
This is really good.

632
00:43:37,975 --> 00:43:39,777
I think the guy from The Times is here.

633
00:43:43,448 --> 00:43:44,914
She's a liar.

634
00:43:44,915 --> 00:43:46,116
Why would she lie?

635
00:43:46,117 --> 00:43:47,851
Why don't you believe me?

636
00:43:47,852 --> 00:43:49,486
She said you stabbed a kid, Danny.

637
00:43:49,487 --> 00:43:51,988
You have no idea
what I had to do in there,

638
00:43:51,989 --> 00:43:55,159
what they called me,
what they did to me.

639
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:58,195
And Angus?
He's a creep, a stalker, and a fag.

640
00:43:58,196 --> 00:44:00,397
It doesn't matter.
Whatever.

641
00:44:00,398 --> 00:44:02,065
Fuck, you hate me.
Why do you hate me?

642
00:44:02,066 --> 00:44:03,433
I don't hate you.
Would you stop it?

643
00:44:03,434 --> 00:44:05,169
Why do you hate me?
Would you stop it?

644
00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:06,503
I don't hate you.
I'm just trying to figure out

645
00:44:06,504 --> 00:44:07,837
what happened at Windsor, that's all.

646
00:44:07,838 --> 00:44:08,958
You still think I killed her.

647
00:44:10,941 --> 00:44:12,709
Well, I didn't.

648
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:13,910
It wasn't me.

649
00:44:13,911 --> 00:44:15,111
It was someone else who did that stuff.

650
00:44:15,112 --> 00:44:16,613
I don't know who it was.
Fuck it.

651
00:44:16,614 --> 00:44:17,747
I have to go to work!

652
00:44:17,748 --> 00:44:19,149
Danny, stop it.
Stop it!

653
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:20,517
You were supposed to help me, I thought.

654
00:44:20,518 --> 00:44:22,986
You were. You were.
Will you calm down?

655
00:44:22,987 --> 00:44:24,654
You were supposed to fucking help me!

656
00:44:24,655 --> 00:44:26,122
Danny!
Fuck! Fuck!

657
00:44:26,123 --> 00:44:27,824
Danny, calm down.

658
00:44:27,825 --> 00:44:29,527
Danny, Danny, Danny.

659
00:44:31,962 --> 00:44:33,330
Those used to belong to me.

660
00:44:33,331 --> 00:44:35,499
I don't know who they
belong to anymore, okay?

661
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:36,834
Fucking take it.

662
00:44:40,171 --> 00:44:41,238
Are you finished?

663
00:44:41,239 --> 00:44:42,839
Now you want to tell me

664
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,140
what really happened at Windsor?

665
00:44:44,141 --> 00:44:47,377
Why? So you can pretend
like you give a shit?

666
00:44:47,378 --> 00:44:49,446
Hey, just wai... wait a second.

667
00:44:49,447 --> 00:44:51,915
Danny!

668
00:44:51,916 --> 00:44:53,318
God damn it.

00:45:47,705 --> 00:45:50,106
Listen...
No, no, no. Wait. Wait.

674
00:45:50,107 --> 00:45:52,108
I want... I want to buy you a drink.

675
00:45:52,109 --> 00:45:53,277
Tom.

676
00:45:53,278 --> 00:45:54,744
No, come on, sit.

677
00:45:54,745 --> 00:45:55,979
Sit down.
Sit, sit, sit.

678
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:57,881
Have a drink with me.

679
00:45:57,882 --> 00:45:59,484
- One drink.
- Thank you.

680
00:46:00,685 --> 00:46:03,588
So, have you heard
anything from our boy?

681
00:46:04,755 --> 00:46:05,756
He's at my house...

682
00:46:07,057 --> 00:46:08,259
On the couch.

683
00:46:09,494 --> 00:46:11,194
I don't know what you said to him,

684
00:46:11,195 --> 00:46:13,863
but he's trying to turn his life around,

685
00:46:13,864 --> 00:46:16,300
and digging up the past
is not gonna help him.

686
00:46:16,301 --> 00:46:17,767
Wait a second.
I thought you wanted me to...

687
00:46:17,768 --> 00:46:21,237
Not like that.
To keep going over and over it, Tommy?

688
00:46:21,238 --> 00:46:23,440
I mean, come on.

689
00:46:23,441 --> 00:46:25,141
If you have doubts about your decision,

690
00:46:25,142 --> 00:46:26,876
you need to leave that shit back there.

691
00:46:26,877 --> 00:46:29,379
Come on, Angela. You know
that's not what's happening here.

692
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:30,715
So, what did he tell you?

693
00:46:31,982 --> 00:46:33,317
Angela, what did he say?

694
00:46:33,318 --> 00:46:36,152
Look, all I know is
if you're not helping,

695
00:46:36,153 --> 00:46:37,288
you're hurting.

696
00:46:42,059 --> 00:46:43,328

700
00:47:06,083 --> 00:47:07,150
What word?
"Work."

701
00:47:07,151 --> 00:47:09,118
Look, I know, but I really...

702
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:10,286
What did I just say?

703
00:47:10,287 --> 00:47:12,289
No, I got it.
It's fine.

704
00:47:28,005 --> 00:47:29,806
So, what's with all the new bags?

705
00:47:29,807 --> 00:47:31,942
Did you listen to my message?
Yeah.

706
00:47:33,711 --> 00:47:34,745
All of it?

707
00:47:37,281 --> 00:47:38,415
Colin Waters.

708
00:47:38,416 --> 00:47:39,849
The Colin Waters Gallery.

709
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:42,151
No, no, I know.
Colin Waters. That's great.

710
00:47:42,152 --> 00:47:44,053
Do you know who Colin Waters is?

711
00:47:44,054 --> 00:47:44,621
Are you serious?

712
00:47:44,623 --> 00:47:46,322
Yeah, of course I know
who Colin Waters is.

713
00:47:46,323 --> 00:47:48,492
Come on.
There is no Colin Waters.

714
00:47:48,493 --> 00:47:50,827
It's just a bunch of guys who
call themselves Colin Waters,

715
00:47:50,828 --> 00:47:52,696
but they have a gallery in Bushwick,

716
00:47:52,697 --> 00:47:54,731
and they want to give me a show.

717
00:47:54,732 --> 00:47:56,332
That's great.
And they have a studio

718
00:47:56,333 --> 00:47:58,435
above the gallery where I can work.

719
00:47:58,436 --> 00:48:00,404
In Brooklyn?
Yeah.

720
00:48:00,405 --> 00:48:02,539
Do you know how hard it is
for a figurative painter

721
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:04,408
to get a solo show these days?

722
00:48:04,409 --> 00:48:06,476
No, I... I know.
That's great.

723
00:48:06,477 --> 00:48:07,911
That's great news, honey.

724
00:48:07,912 --> 00:48:10,415
Congrats, really.

725
00:48:20,224 --> 00:48:21,958
Oh, Jesus.

726
00:48:21,959 --> 00:48:24,027
They got here before me.

727
00:48:24,028 --> 00:48:26,029
I need to bring some work

728
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:28,598
and other things down there.

729
00:48:28,599 --> 00:48:30,635
You should have listened to the message.

730
00:48:33,804 --> 00:48:34,638
Hey.

731
00:48:34,639 --> 00:48:36,005
What's up, Lauren?

732
00:48:36,006 --> 00:48:37,807
This is Tom, my husband Tom.

733
00:48:37,808 --> 00:48:40,077
Ah. Hey, man.
What's happening?

734
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,594
The chair?

735
00:48:57,595 --> 00:49:00,263
Well, I need a place to sit, right?
It's just...

736
00:49:00,264 --> 00:49:02,298
I mean, it's just
a kitchenette right now.

737
00:49:02,299 --> 00:49:04,134
It's an empty space.

738
00:49:52,617 --> 00:49:54,685
It feels like you're moving out.

739
00:49:55,886 --> 00:49:58,755
Well, only if you don't come with me.

740
00:50:00,124 --> 00:50:01,457
Tom.

741
00:50:01,458 --> 00:50:05,194
The city, a room,

742
00:50:05,195 --> 00:50:07,664
kind of like when we first met.

743
00:50:07,665 --> 00:50:10,534
We didn't leave your
apartment for a month.

744
00:50:10,535 --> 00:50:12,401
The show's not until June.

745
00:50:12,402 --> 00:50:14,103
We have over a month.

746
00:50:14,104 --> 00:50:15,438
You're shaking your head.

747
00:50:15,439 --> 00:50:16,873
Why are you shaking your head?

748
00:50:16,874 --> 00:50:18,976
Am I shaking my head?
Yeah.

749
00:50:20,244 --> 00:50:22,779
I think this book is getting to you,

750
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:26,315
all those stories about kids.

751
00:50:26,316 --> 00:50:28,852
You know what?
You're right.

752
00:50:28,853 --> 00:50:30,888
This is a really good
opportunity for you.

753
00:50:32,957 --> 00:50:34,191
I'm so tired.

754
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:38,696
Put me to bed, will you?
Mm-hmm.

755
00:50:59,349 --> 00:51:00,917
Oh! I need to stop at the bakery.

756
00:51:00,918 --> 00:51:03,086
I want to get something
for the guys at the gallery,

757
00:51:03,087 --> 00:51:05,154
you know, those muffins that we love.

758
00:51:05,155 --> 00:51:06,691
Sure.

759
00:51:58,108 --> 00:51:59,108
Who was that?

760
00:51:59,109 --> 00:52:01,645
Ian. Isn't that crazy?

761
00:52:01,646 --> 00:52:03,279
What did he want?

762
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:04,681
I don't know.
I couldn't tell you.

763
00:52:04,682 --> 00:52:06,716
I was too distracted by his charm.

764
00:52:06,717 --> 00:52:07,917
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

765
00:52:07,918 --> 00:52:10,153
Whoa, what is going on with you?

766
00:52:10,154 --> 00:52:12,088
What's going on with me?
What's going on with you?

767
00:52:12,089 --> 00:52:14,390
You think you can hang out with
someone your own age for once?

768
00:52:14,391 --> 00:52:16,860
Huh?
Fuck you.

769
00:52:16,861 --> 00:52:18,595
No, seriously, fuck you.

770
00:52:26,336 --> 00:52:30,406
Ladies and gentlemen, announcing
train number 1-7-9,

771
00:52:30,407 --> 00:52:33,209
the 8:17 p.m. into...

772
00:52:33,210 --> 00:52:34,510
Lauren, wait.

773
00:52:34,511 --> 00:52:35,879
I'm sorry.

774
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:38,381
I just... I got a lot
on my mind right now,

775
00:52:38,382 --> 00:52:41,584
and I think maybe
the book is getting to me.

776
00:52:41,585 --> 00:52:45,755
You know, just writing about
these kids and these cases every day

777
00:52:45,756 --> 00:52:47,390
has just taken its toll.
I'm sorry.

778
00:52:47,391 --> 00:52:48,624
I just feel like I'm losing you...

779
00:52:48,625 --> 00:52:51,494
Tom, it's time.

780
00:52:51,495 --> 00:52:53,129
For what?

781
00:52:53,130 --> 00:52:55,298
Everything.

782
00:52:55,299 --> 00:52:57,802
Good things, everything
that we talked about.

783
00:53:03,007 --> 00:53:03,908
Tom?

784
00:53:07,077 --> 00:53:08,078
Tom.

785
00:53:11,048 --> 00:53:12,381
Tom.

786
00:53:12,382 --> 00:53:13,516
Yes.

787
00:53:13,517 --> 00:53:15,518
I know, I know.
You're right.

788
00:53:15,519 --> 00:53:17,154
I'll see you in a day or two.

789
00:53:34,739 --> 00:53:38,241
She's okay, even if she's an artist,

790
00:53:38,242 --> 00:53:40,744
and you should go down there
and spend more time with her.

791
00:53:40,745 --> 00:53:42,411
Ah, it's complicated, Mom.

792
00:53:42,412 --> 00:53:43,847
Complicated?

793
00:53:43,848 --> 00:53:44,881
Religion is complicated.

794
00:53:44,882 --> 00:53:46,649
Politics is complicated.

795
00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:47,650
And Dad?

796
00:53:47,651 --> 00:53:49,052
Complicated.

797
00:53:49,053 --> 00:53:50,186
But I wasn't.

798
00:53:50,187 --> 00:53:51,220
I was easy.

799
00:53:53,657 --> 00:53:57,060
You see who he's got working out there?

800
00:53:57,061 --> 00:53:58,061
You remember.

801
00:53:58,062 --> 00:53:59,095
That's Neil.

802
00:53:59,096 --> 00:54:00,865
That's little Neil Bridges.

803
00:54:02,199 --> 00:54:05,469
You boys used to torture him
something terrible.

804
00:54:24,388 --> 00:54:25,389
What's he doing here?

805
00:54:26,757 --> 00:54:28,292
Uh, he needed a job.

806
00:54:29,559 --> 00:54:32,061
It's the least I could do.

807
00:54:32,062 --> 00:54:35,631
Man, I can still hear him
crying, screaming.

808
00:54:35,632 --> 00:54:37,967
I don't even remember
who went in after him.

809
00:54:37,968 --> 00:54:40,569
I know it wasn't me.
Wasn't you.

810
00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:42,907
My father.
He jumped in, remember?

811
00:54:48,412 --> 00:54:50,279
You ever think about
what would have happened if...

812
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:51,480
No.

813
00:54:51,481 --> 00:54:53,150
Not really.

814
00:55:33,190 --> 00:55:36,025
Um, what kind of tea do you have?

815
00:55:36,026 --> 00:55:37,994
Uh, we got black tea, green tea,

816
00:55:37,995 --> 00:55:40,163
chai, peppermint, uh, Earl Grey.

817
00:55:40,164 --> 00:55:42,999
Nothing with caffeine, though, right?

818
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,567
Hi.

819
00:55:44,568 --> 00:55:45,969
Ian, hi.

820
00:55:45,970 --> 00:55:48,537
Hey.
What are you, uh...

821
00:55:48,538 --> 00:55:49,939
What are you doing in the city?

822
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:51,507
Uh, anything herbal's fine.

823
00:55:51,508 --> 00:55:52,909
I got it, I got it.
What...

824
00:55:52,910 --> 00:55:54,310
What are you doing in the city?

825
00:55:54,311 --> 00:55:57,947
I, um... I was staying at my friend's,

826
00:55:57,948 --> 00:55:59,648
had an interview for Hunter, so...

827
00:55:59,649 --> 00:56:01,350
Oh, that's great.
That's great.

828
00:56:01,351 --> 00:56:02,552
Yeah.

829
00:56:03,854 --> 00:56:05,054
Thanks.

830
00:56:05,055 --> 00:56:06,423
What a coincidence.
This is crazy.

831
00:56:09,193 --> 00:56:10,994
Exactly, exactly.

832
00:56:10,995 --> 00:56:12,728
I mean, like, obviously I want
people to see my work.

833
00:56:12,729 --> 00:56:13,997
Otherwise, what's
the point of making it?

834
00:56:13,998 --> 00:56:15,398
Right, but still...

835
00:56:15,399 --> 00:56:17,833
I totally forgot how noisy
this neighborhood is.

836
00:56:17,834 --> 00:56:19,268
Yeah.
Like... oh, sorry.

837
00:56:19,269 --> 00:56:21,470
You have an eyelash
that's about to fall out.

838
00:56:21,471 --> 00:56:23,206
Good. Do I have to blow on it?

839
00:56:23,207 --> 00:56:24,407
Yeah.

840
00:56:24,408 --> 00:56:26,309
Thank you.
Um...

841
00:56:26,310 --> 00:56:28,477
I used to be really into
this thing called "encaustic,"

842
00:56:28,478 --> 00:56:30,113
which I'm trying to bring back.

843
00:56:30,114 --> 00:56:31,915
It's like you take beeswax and resin,

844
00:56:31,916 --> 00:56:33,616
and you put that on the canvas.

845
00:56:33,617 --> 00:56:34,850
It makes it three-dimensional,

846
00:56:34,851 --> 00:56:35,919
and, like, you can iron it

847
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,286
and melt it.
It's amazing.

848
00:56:37,287 --> 00:56:40,623
I mean, I have to tell you that, uh...

849
00:56:40,624 --> 00:56:41,991
Yes?

850
00:56:41,992 --> 00:56:44,194
Um, it doesn't matter.

851
00:56:46,230 --> 00:56:47,763
What? Come on.
You can't do that.

852
00:56:47,764 --> 00:56:49,332
What?

853
00:56:49,333 --> 00:56:50,534
Um...

854
00:56:52,136 --> 00:56:54,871
You're... you're incredibly inspiring.

855
00:56:55,973 --> 00:56:58,474
This makes me feel like, um...

856
00:56:58,475 --> 00:57:01,011
I don't know, like...
Like anything's possible.

857
00:57:06,450 --> 00:57:07,351
I got it.

858
00:57:09,686 --> 00:57:12,089
Dr. Seymour is a very lucky man.

859
00:57:14,791 --> 00:57:16,459

Rough night, huh?

871
00:58:05,709 --> 00:58:07,876
Yeah, I ran into some old friends.

872
00:58:07,877 --> 00:58:09,045
And Lauren?

873
00:58:09,046 --> 00:58:11,247
She's down in New York.

874
00:58:11,248 --> 00:58:12,716
So, what's up?
You called me?

875
00:58:18,155 --> 00:58:20,156
Ian's father knows he's out.

876
00:58:20,157 --> 00:58:21,790
He called the penitentiary

877
00:58:21,791 --> 00:58:23,592
asking questions about his son.

878
00:58:23,593 --> 00:58:25,328
Did he call you?

879
00:58:25,329 --> 00:58:26,996
Call me?
Why would he call me?

880
00:58:26,997 --> 00:58:28,931
I'm worried he's gonna try to find Ian.

881
00:58:28,932 --> 00:58:30,333
I thought he was staying with you.

882
00:58:30,334 --> 00:58:32,135
No, he went back to his apartment,

883
00:58:32,136 --> 00:58:34,403
and he's not there,
and he's not at work.

884
00:58:34,404 --> 00:58:36,872
He missed his appointment today.

885
00:58:36,873 --> 00:58:38,975
That's never happened before.

886
00:58:41,045 --> 00:58:43,047
Who's Angus McDonald?

887
00:58:44,114 --> 00:58:45,282
He told you about that?

888
00:58:46,683 --> 00:58:48,217
God damn it, Tom.

889
00:58:48,218 --> 00:58:51,287
Stabbings like that happen
all the time in juvie, okay?

890
00:58:51,288 --> 00:58:52,821
So let's not exaggerate it.

891
00:58:52,822 --> 00:58:55,558
Wait. He didn't go find Angus, did he?

892
00:58:55,559 --> 00:58:57,693
Angela, I don't know.
I don't know where he is.

893
00:58:57,694 --> 00:58:59,962
'Cause I got my eye on Angus.

894
00:58:59,963 --> 00:59:03,232
He's up on campus.
What a piece of work.

895
00:59:03,233 --> 00:59:06,402
Those kids, students he's had
coming in and out of there.

896
00:59:06,403 --> 00:59:08,171
He always seems to be two drinks away

897
00:59:08,172 --> 00:59:09,705
from whatever perverted
shit he's thinking.

898
00:59:09,706 --> 00:59:12,541
Angela, listen, your
investment in this kid...

899
00:59:12,542 --> 00:59:14,610
Don't you analyze me.

900
00:59:14,611 --> 00:59:16,545
You worry about your own investments.

901
00:59:16,546 --> 00:59:18,481
I'm just not sure
he's who you want him to be.

902
00:59:18,482 --> 00:59:19,848
Jesus, who is?

903
00:59:19,849 --> 00:59:21,517
Who is?

904
00:59:21,518 --> 00:59:23,886
And you need to worry
about who you need him to be.

905
00:59:23,887 --> 00:59:25,654
Angela, I don't need him
to be anybody, okay?

906
00:59:25,655 --> 00:59:27,090
Just do me a favor, okay?

907
00:59:27,091 --> 00:59:29,825
If he reaches out,

908
00:59:29,826 --> 00:59:32,895
you hold him, keep him,

909
00:59:32,896 --> 00:59:35,232
and don't do anything until I get there.

910
01:00:00,557 --> 01:00:01,590
Hi.

911
01:00:01,591 --> 01:00:02,925
Hello.

912
01:00:02,926 --> 01:00:04,793
- Dr. Seymour?
- Yes.

913
01:00:04,794 --> 01:00:07,029
Professor McDonald's inside.

914
01:00:07,030 --> 01:00:08,464
First time here?
Um...

915
01:00:08,465 --> 01:00:10,534
I've spoken a few times on campus.

916
01:00:14,037 --> 01:00:15,705
Jeremy.
Yeah?

917
01:00:17,141 --> 01:00:18,907
Is there any coffee left?

918
01:00:18,908 --> 01:00:20,177
Cold.
Good.

919
01:00:21,211 --> 01:00:22,945
He likes cold coffee.

920
01:00:22,946 --> 01:00:23,946
That's good.

921
01:00:23,947 --> 01:00:25,148
Dr. Seymour.

922
01:00:25,149 --> 01:00:26,982
Mr. McDonald.

923
01:00:26,983 --> 01:00:29,752
Have a seat, please.

924
01:00:29,753 --> 01:00:32,156
Don't worry about him.
He's been up all night.

925
01:00:35,659 --> 01:00:38,662
So, Danny Miller, huh?

926
01:00:40,797 --> 01:00:41,797
Yes.

927
01:00:41,798 --> 01:00:44,301
Where is he?
Do you know?

928
01:00:45,602 --> 01:00:46,836
I don't know, actually.

929
01:00:48,305 --> 01:00:50,306
Where is Danny?
Everyone wants to know.

930
01:00:50,307 --> 01:00:51,974
Or is it, "Who is Danny?"

931
01:00:51,975 --> 01:00:53,309
Right?

932
01:00:53,310 --> 01:00:55,110
Angus read your book,

933
01:00:55,111 --> 01:00:56,879
your first book.

934
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:59,715
You have a very optimistic view

935
01:00:59,716 --> 01:01:01,350
of your profession, Doctor,

936
01:01:01,351 --> 01:01:04,019
except for when it comes to Danny.

937
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:05,555
So, what is it you want to know?

938
01:01:07,056 --> 01:01:08,491
Well, one thing I'd like to know

939
01:01:08,492 --> 01:01:10,893
is how a writing class
turned into a stabbing.

940
01:01:10,894 --> 01:01:12,596
Hmm.

941
01:01:16,233 --> 01:01:18,267
And if I tell you,

942
01:01:18,268 --> 01:01:20,469
will you give him my address?

943
01:01:20,470 --> 01:01:22,070
Do you want me to give him your address?

944
01:01:22,071 --> 01:01:23,439
Now you sound like a therapist.

945
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:25,874
And as a therapist, you should know

946
01:01:25,875 --> 01:01:27,543
that Danny is not the victim.

947
01:01:27,544 --> 01:01:30,513
He could be a very seductive young man,

948
01:01:30,514 --> 01:01:32,515
and, well,

949
01:01:32,516 --> 01:01:34,517
I don't know what he told you,

950
01:01:34,518 --> 01:01:36,385
but nothing happened between us,

951
01:01:36,386 --> 01:01:39,422
nothing physical, at least.

952
01:01:39,423 --> 01:01:42,057
Everything I did for him, and...

953
01:01:42,058 --> 01:01:43,926
I'm the one accused.

954
01:01:43,927 --> 01:01:45,594
You know what he's capable of.

955
01:01:45,595 --> 01:01:46,562
I'm sure you do.

956
01:01:46,563 --> 01:01:49,131
He wrote about you over and over.

957
01:01:49,132 --> 01:01:51,834
You see, Danny is crazed with talent,

958
01:01:51,835 --> 01:01:53,068
a strong writer,

959
01:01:53,069 --> 01:01:55,271
but a black hole.

960
01:01:55,272 --> 01:01:58,608
You get taken.
He takes you in.

961
01:01:59,776 --> 01:02:01,210
Jeremy!

962
01:02:01,211 --> 01:02:03,879
Now, this story that Danny
was writing in my class,

963
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:05,414
well, excuse the pun,

964
01:02:05,415 --> 01:02:07,416
but he looked me in the eye.

965
01:02:07,417 --> 01:02:08,851
He walked across the room

966
01:02:08,852 --> 01:02:10,753
and showed me the point of it.

967
01:02:10,754 --> 01:02:13,356
See?
But the thing is,

968
01:02:13,357 --> 01:02:15,090
he seemed to enjoy it.

969
01:02:15,091 --> 01:02:18,294
I mean, Danny seemed
to enjoy the act of it.

970
01:02:18,295 --> 01:02:20,929
Fucker acted like he was my friend,

971
01:02:20,930 --> 01:02:22,531
but he ain't shit.
See?

972
01:02:22,532 --> 01:02:24,567
Don't be alone with him.

973
01:02:24,568 --> 01:02:26,303
I'm not worried about that.

974
01:02:27,203 --> 01:02:28,372
Lucky you.

975
01:02:47,724 --> 01:02:49,191
Dr. Seymour.

976
01:02:49,192 --> 01:02:50,826
Dr. Seymour. Hi.

977
01:02:50,827 --> 01:02:52,160
Hi.
I'm sorry, but, uh...

978
01:02:52,161 --> 01:02:54,263
I know this seems a little awkward,

979
01:02:54,264 --> 01:02:56,865
but could you sign the book, your book?

980
01:02:56,866 --> 01:02:58,000
Oh, sure, sure.
Come in.

981
01:02:58,001 --> 01:02:58,902
Come in.
Oh.

982
01:03:01,305 --> 01:03:03,171
Whew.
It's cold out there.

983
01:03:03,172 --> 01:03:04,673
Yeah.

984
01:03:04,674 --> 01:03:06,442
Oh, wow. I haven't seen this in a while.

985
01:03:06,443 --> 01:03:10,413
Yeah. I started reading, and I like it.

986
01:03:10,414 --> 01:03:11,914
Yeah?
A lot, yeah.

987
01:03:11,915 --> 01:03:14,116
Uh, but the stories
the children tell themselves,

988
01:03:14,117 --> 01:03:18,887
I mean, they're more for
the adults than for them, right?

989
01:03:18,888 --> 01:03:20,088
Maybe for both.

990
01:03:20,089 --> 01:03:21,690
What's your name again?

991
01:03:21,691 --> 01:03:22,926
Rowena.

992
01:03:24,761 --> 01:03:26,295
You know, I, uh...

993
01:03:26,296 --> 01:03:28,297
Saw you speak on campus.

994
01:03:28,298 --> 01:03:29,666
You were great.

995
01:04:20,684 --> 01:04:21,850
Hello. Ange?

996
01:04:21,851 --> 01:04:24,052
We have a problem.

997
01:04:24,053 --> 01:04:25,320
Why? What's wrong?

998
01:04:25,321 --> 01:04:27,322
Any word from Danny?

999
01:04:27,323 --> 01:04:28,924
Dan... no.
Why?

1000
01:04:28,925 --> 01:04:31,794
I got a call from Danny's
father on my phone,

1001
01:04:31,795 --> 01:04:33,496
my personal phone.

1002
01:04:33,497 --> 01:04:36,064
He said he knows where Danny is.

1003
01:04:36,065 --> 01:04:37,966
I don't know what he's up to.

1004
01:04:37,967 --> 01:04:40,869
Can you talk some sense into him
before he does something stupid?

1005
01:04:40,870 --> 01:04:43,305
He's not stable.

1006
01:04:43,306 --> 01:04:45,041
I traced the phone to Norwich.

1007
01:04:49,779 --> 01:04:51,480
You have an address?

1008
01:04:51,481 --> 01:04:52,916
I'll call you back.

1009
01:06:56,806 --> 01:06:58,707
Hey, you following me, asshole?

1010
01:06:58,708 --> 01:07:01,777
Don't you think I know when
somebody's following me?

1011
01:07:01,778 --> 01:07:04,346
Don't you think I know who
you are, Dr. Seymour?

1012
01:07:04,347 --> 01:07:06,414
I'm just here to talk about your won.

1013
01:07:06,415 --> 01:07:09,017
My son's no good.
He's no good, all right?

1014
01:07:09,018 --> 01:07:09,885
He's an embarrassment.

1015
01:07:09,886 --> 01:07:11,687
He needs to go back in the hole.

1016
01:07:11,688 --> 01:07:13,355
Captain, I know you've
been trying to contact him.

1017
01:07:13,356 --> 01:07:15,691
Not that it's any of your
business who's contacting who,

1018
01:07:15,692 --> 01:07:18,694
but obviously you've been in
contact with him, huh, Doctor?

1019
01:07:18,695 --> 01:07:20,896
You know, I thought you'd be
the one fucker to understand

1020
01:07:20,897 --> 01:07:22,765
that him going to prison
was a good thing.

1021
01:07:22,766 --> 01:07:24,833
Well, he's out now, and
we're just trying to help him...

1022
01:07:24,834 --> 01:07:26,535
And he needs to be stopped.

1023
01:07:26,536 --> 01:07:28,571
All right?

1024
01:07:28,572 --> 01:07:30,639
Don't you know how hard that is

1025
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:32,809
for a father to say about his own son?

1026
01:07:34,477 --> 01:07:37,212
Huh? You know what?
Get the fuck out of here.

1027
01:07:37,213 --> 01:07:39,749
You're like all those other
fucking bleeding hearts.

1028
01:07:40,950 --> 01:07:43,152
You got no clue
what you're dealing with.

1029
01:07:53,096 --> 01:07:55,130
- Hi.
- Hey.

1030
01:07:56,332 --> 01:07:58,066
Hey, honey, I'm sorry.
I miss you.

1031
01:07:58,067 --> 01:07:59,802
Wait. Hold on a second.
I can't... I can't hear you.

1032
01:07:59,803 --> 01:08:01,604
Let me just turn this down.

1033
01:08:01,605 --> 01:08:03,405
Where are you?

1034
01:08:03,406 --> 01:08:04,640
I'm at home.

1035
01:08:04,641 --> 01:08:06,141
Your parents'?

1036
01:08:06,142 --> 01:08:08,043
No, at our home. I missed you, too.

1037
01:08:08,044 --> 01:08:10,221
Right. Well, I'm on my
way back right now, okay?

1038
01:08:10,223 --> 01:08:10,946
Good.

1039
01:08:10,947 --> 01:08:12,581
How much longer do you think you'll be,

1040
01:08:12,582 --> 01:08:14,216
'cause we're making dinner.

1041
01:08:14,217 --> 01:08:15,918
Oh, yeah?
Who's there?

1042
01:08:15,919 --> 01:08:18,721
Ian. We drove back
together from the city.

1043
01:08:18,722 --> 01:08:20,656
Lauren, I don't want him in our house.

1044
01:08:20,657 --> 01:08:22,557
Have you ever used a knife
before in your life?

1045
01:08:22,558 --> 01:08:24,192
I'm trying to keep it all together.

1046
01:08:24,193 --> 01:08:26,561
Those vegetables aren't
going to cut themselves.

1047
01:08:26,562 --> 01:08:28,063
No, Lauren, I'm not kidding.
Listen to me.

1048
01:08:28,064 --> 01:08:29,665
Are you listening in on my phone call,

1049
01:08:29,666 --> 01:08:31,166
my private phone call?

1050
01:08:31,167 --> 01:08:33,268
Lauren, step into
the other room right now.

1051
01:08:33,269 --> 01:08:34,837
Oh, this music.
Lauren.

1052
01:08:34,838 --> 01:08:36,805
Please put on a song that
doesn't give me a headache.

1053
01:08:36,806 --> 01:08:38,406
Thank you.
Lauren, listen to me.

1054
01:08:38,407 --> 01:08:39,875
Okay, well, we'll wait for you to eat.

1055
01:08:39,876 --> 01:08:41,476
No, no, Lauren, Lauren.

1056
01:08:50,954 --> 01:08:52,420
What's wrong?

1057
01:08:52,421 --> 01:08:53,623
Let's go!

1058
01:09:06,870 --> 01:09:08,203
Go!

1059
01:09:09,939 --> 01:09:11,941
Lauren?

1060
01:09:13,076 --> 01:09:14,242
Lauren.

1061
01:09:14,243 --> 01:09:15,778
Didn't you hear me calling me?

1062
01:09:15,779 --> 01:09:17,145
Well, hello to you, too.

1063
01:09:17,146 --> 01:09:19,281
What the hell do you think
you're doing, huh?

1064
01:09:19,282 --> 01:09:21,684
I... I'm sorry. We were
just having some dinner.

1065
01:09:21,685 --> 01:09:23,618
Just relax.
Don't tell me to relax.

1066
01:09:23,619 --> 01:09:25,620
Ian, you need to leave
my house right now.

1067
01:09:25,621 --> 01:09:27,055
Tom.
It's okay.

1068
01:09:27,056 --> 01:09:28,123
Now.
Okay.

1069
01:09:28,124 --> 01:09:29,258
Okay.

1070
01:09:31,695 --> 01:09:33,729
Um, thank you for dinner.

1071
01:09:33,730 --> 01:09:34,898
It was lovely.

1072
01:09:41,537 --> 01:09:43,571
Why would you talk to him like that?

1073
01:09:43,572 --> 01:09:45,041
You don't know anything about him.

1074
01:09:49,545 --> 01:09:53,049
Danny, I thought we said you weren't
gonna come to my house anymore.

1075
01:09:55,518 --> 01:09:56,518
Have you seen the news?

1076
01:09:56,519 --> 01:09:57,686
No. Why?

1077
01:09:57,687 --> 01:09:59,756
An old man got murdered up in Danbury.

1078
01:10:00,757 --> 01:10:02,191
Two kids did it.

1079
01:10:04,293 --> 01:10:06,628
It's all gonna happen again,
isn't it, all of it?

1080
01:10:06,629 --> 01:10:09,231
Have you talked to your father?

1081
01:10:09,232 --> 01:10:10,666
Why would I do that?

1082
01:10:12,268 --> 01:10:13,169
Have you?

1083
01:10:15,538 --> 01:10:17,940
Shit. They're gonna put me away again.

1084
01:10:17,941 --> 01:10:20,376
They're gonna fuck me over again.

1085
01:10:28,718 --> 01:10:31,553
You have no idea
who this kid is, okay, none.

1086
01:10:31,554 --> 01:10:32,687
And you do?

1087
01:10:32,688 --> 01:10:34,556
He's not a page out of the DSM.

1088
01:10:34,557 --> 01:10:35,458
He's a child.

1089
01:10:36,793 --> 01:10:38,427
I want you to stay away from him.

1090
01:10:39,763 --> 01:10:41,529
Just trust me on this, okay?

1091
01:10:41,530 --> 01:10:43,031
Stay away.

1092
01:10:43,032 --> 01:10:45,167
Okay, fine.

1093
01:10:48,437 --> 01:10:50,306
I need to finish this.

1094
01:11:52,168 --> 01:11:54,036
Dr. Seymour, Tom.
I was wondering

1095
01:11:54,037 --> 01:11:56,038
if we could talk to you for a second.

1096
01:11:56,039 --> 01:11:58,240
We'd like to get a comment on
the piece that's running tonight

1097
01:11:58,241 --> 01:11:59,808
about the two juveniles in Danbury.

1098
01:11:59,809 --> 01:12:00,976
They're not my clients.

1099
01:12:00,977 --> 01:12:02,410
Do you mind if we turn on the camera?

1100
01:12:02,411 --> 01:12:04,046
Actually, I do.
I'm not involved in that case.

1101
01:12:04,047 --> 01:12:06,481
No, but you are aware
they released Daniel Miller,

1102
01:12:06,482 --> 01:12:07,715
the young man who murdered

1103
01:12:07,716 --> 01:12:09,417
Elizabeth Parks 12 years ago?

1104
01:12:09,418 --> 01:12:10,785
He was a client, a patient.

1105
01:12:10,786 --> 01:12:12,120
As a matter of policy, I don't comment

1106
01:12:12,121 --> 01:12:13,890
on my clients, past or present.
Sorry.

1107
01:12:18,161 --> 01:12:20,195
I'd go on down
the north fork for salmon,

1108
01:12:20,196 --> 01:12:24,132
and all of a sudden, it was
whitewater rafting in-boat.

1109
01:12:24,133 --> 01:12:26,134
What am I doing here, the north fork

1110
01:12:26,135 --> 01:12:29,104
of the Salmon River in Ida...

1111
01:12:29,105 --> 01:12:31,306
Put a pin in that.
We will continue.

1112
01:12:31,307 --> 01:12:33,542
I gotta go put out a fire.
I'll be right back.

1113
01:12:35,111 --> 01:12:37,045
Did you tell her?
Calm down.

1114
01:12:37,046 --> 01:12:39,347
Did you tell your reporter friend
he was out?

1115
01:12:39,348 --> 01:12:40,883
Calm down.
Did you?

1116
01:12:40,884 --> 01:12:41,884
She already knew.

1117
01:12:41,885 --> 01:12:44,252
I just confirmed it.

1118
01:12:44,253 --> 01:12:46,488
Father's out there talking
to anybody who will listen.

1119
01:12:46,489 --> 01:12:48,190
Fuck.
Tom.

1120
01:12:48,191 --> 01:12:50,158
Tommy.

1121
01:12:50,159 --> 01:12:53,228
Did you actually think this was
never gonna get back to us?

1122
01:12:53,229 --> 01:12:54,863
Just because we sent that kid away

1123
01:12:54,864 --> 01:12:56,764
doesn't mean he's going to stay away.

1124
01:12:56,765 --> 01:12:57,934
Come on.

1125
01:12:59,435 --> 01:13:03,305
I, uh... I'm going to
go back to my meeting.

1126
01:13:03,306 --> 01:13:06,774
If you, uh... if you
would like to grab a drink

1127
01:13:06,775 --> 01:13:08,877
and forget that we ever got involved

1128
01:13:08,878 --> 01:13:10,345
with this fucking thing to begin with,

1129
01:13:10,346 --> 01:13:13,015
please just give me a call,
but calm down.

1130
01:13:13,016 --> 01:13:15,017
She's going to run whatever she has

1131
01:13:15,018 --> 01:13:16,919
tonight, tomorrow, whatever,

1132
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:18,486
and it'll be done.

1133
01:13:18,487 --> 01:13:22,224
And the number one thing
we can rely on are people

1134
01:13:22,225 --> 01:13:26,295
and people's complete lack of
follow-through and long-term memory.

1135
01:13:27,696 --> 01:13:29,365
So calm the fuck down.

1136
01:13:45,681 --> 01:13:47,282
Danny.

1137
01:13:47,283 --> 01:13:48,984
Listen, I think me, you, and Angela

1138
01:13:48,985 --> 01:13:50,585
need to get together, make a plan.

1139
01:13:50,586 --> 01:13:54,322
And if you want, we can try and
work on this together, okay?

1140
01:13:54,323 --> 01:13:57,193
But call me back.
I will make the time.

1141
01:14:08,271 --> 01:14:11,506
I went to Lizzie to feed the cats.

1142
01:14:11,507 --> 01:14:15,277
Kittens. We needed to feed the kittens.

1143
01:14:15,278 --> 01:14:17,245
My mother stayed at home,

1144
01:14:17,246 --> 01:14:20,515
and my father was back,
back from the war.

1145
01:14:20,516 --> 01:14:22,817
Are you tired, Danny?

1146
01:14:22,818 --> 01:14:24,686
No. I'm...

1147
01:14:24,687 --> 01:14:25,853
I like Lizzie.

1148
01:14:25,854 --> 01:14:28,456
She couldn't see so good.

1149
01:14:28,457 --> 01:14:30,959
She had, um, cats,

1150
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:32,995
cats in her eyes.

1151
01:14:32,996 --> 01:14:35,763
When I went, she wasn't there,

1152
01:14:35,764 --> 01:14:37,399
so I went upstairs.

1153
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:39,968
She had this powder,

1154
01:14:39,969 --> 01:14:41,736
lady powder,

1155
01:14:41,737 --> 01:14:43,538
smelled like flowers.

1156
01:14:43,539 --> 01:14:44,707
It was sticky.

1157
01:14:46,042 --> 01:14:47,609
And then what?

1158
01:14:47,610 --> 01:14:48,943
I heard her.

1159
01:14:48,944 --> 01:14:53,281
Um, I heard her come in and upstairs.

1160
01:14:53,282 --> 01:14:56,418
I run. I have to get past her,
but she was blocking me.

1161
01:14:56,419 --> 01:14:58,953
She wouldn't move, so I kicked her.

1162
01:14:58,954 --> 01:15:00,855
I kicked her down.

1163
01:15:00,856 --> 01:15:03,125
And she was twitching,
making this noise,

1164
01:15:03,126 --> 01:15:05,227
so I took the cushion off the chair...

1165
01:15:05,228 --> 01:15:07,429
She had these cushions from Boston...

1166
01:15:07,430 --> 01:15:10,999
And covered her face to get her to stop.

1167
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,467
To get her to stop.

1168
01:15:12,468 --> 01:15:16,039
And she kept kicking and kicking.

1169
01:15:17,106 --> 01:15:19,008
And what did that feel like?

1170
01:15:20,509 --> 01:15:22,677
Like a chicken

1171
01:15:22,678 --> 01:15:24,313
with its head cut off.

1172
01:15:27,716 --> 01:15:30,319
Why did you go back?
You went back.

1173
01:15:31,654 --> 01:15:33,056
I don't know.

1174
01:15:35,524 --> 01:15:37,959
But if you knew it was wrong,
why did you go back?

1175
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:40,395
I don't know.

1176
01:15:40,396 --> 01:15:42,064
'Cause your fingers were clean.

1177
01:15:42,065 --> 01:15:44,199
Under your nails...
I don't know.

1178
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:46,368
I don't know who this kid is.

1179
01:15:46,369 --> 01:15:48,002
It's okay, all right?
It's okay.

1180
01:15:48,003 --> 01:15:50,572
Just... just tell me what else
happened back there?

1181
01:15:50,573 --> 01:15:53,308
It doesn't fucking matter what happened!

1182
01:15:53,309 --> 01:15:54,942
You're not gonna believe me, anyway.

1183
01:15:54,943 --> 01:15:56,244
Well, how can anybody help you

1184
01:15:56,245 --> 01:15:57,912
if you continue to take
no responsibility?

1185
01:15:57,913 --> 01:16:00,015
And what about your responsibility?

1186
01:16:02,017 --> 01:16:03,719
I'm sorry that I took that.

1187
01:16:06,389 --> 01:16:08,491
It was wrong.
She's very sweet.

1188
01:16:10,126 --> 01:16:13,628
And give those back to my father.

1189
01:16:13,629 --> 01:16:15,398
I don't want them anymore.

1190
01:16:16,532 --> 01:16:19,167
Wait. Danny, listen.
For your own safety,

1191
01:16:19,168 --> 01:16:21,370
you need to call Angela.

1192
01:16:24,540 --> 01:16:26,908
Danny.

1193
01:16:33,316 --> 01:16:35,250
Ange, it's me.
I found him.

1194
01:16:35,251 --> 01:16:36,918
Where?
In my office.

1195
01:16:36,919 --> 01:16:38,420
Still there?
No, he just left.

1196
01:16:38,421 --> 01:16:40,054
You didn't hold him?
No, I didn't.

1197
01:16:40,055 --> 01:16:41,989
Why?
Because he broke in.

1198
01:16:41,990 --> 01:16:43,391
Because he stole from my house.

1199
01:16:43,392 --> 01:16:45,794
Because he's not my case or my patient!

1200
01:16:49,132 --> 01:16:50,865
It is not known where Daniel Miller

1201
01:16:50,866 --> 01:16:52,700
was relocated after his release,

1202
01:16:52,701 --> 01:16:55,503
but Miller's father spoke with
us earlier this afternoon.

1203
01:16:55,504 --> 01:16:57,739
Why he's out is beyond me.

1204
01:16:57,740 --> 01:17:00,942
Last I heard, he was
somewhere in Connecticut,

1205
01:17:00,943 --> 01:17:03,345
New London, most likely.

1206
01:17:03,346 --> 01:17:05,480
The release of convicted juveniles

1207
01:17:05,481 --> 01:17:07,482
like Daniel Miller has
become a hot topic

1208
01:17:07,483 --> 01:17:09,217
in the wake of recent violent crimes...

1209
01:17:09,218 --> 01:17:10,352
I'm going to bed.

1210
01:17:10,353 --> 01:17:11,953
...by juveniles in the area.

1211
01:17:11,954 --> 01:17:14,257
Oh, hey.
I'll be in in a minute.

1212
01:17:15,591 --> 01:17:17,525
Are you okay?

1213
01:17:17,526 --> 01:17:18,526
Yeah.

1214
01:17:18,527 --> 01:17:20,296
You?

1215
01:17:22,931 --> 01:17:24,133
I don't know.

1216
01:17:26,235 --> 01:17:27,836
I don't know if I'm okay.

1217
01:17:32,141 --> 01:17:34,776
Why didn't you just tell me
that that was him?

1218
01:17:34,777 --> 01:17:38,246
Because it was over
a dozen years ago, Lauren.

1219
01:17:38,247 --> 01:17:40,749
Because I didn't want to put
that back on you, on us.

1220
01:17:42,418 --> 01:17:44,720
That kid needs your help.

1221
01:17:46,255 --> 01:17:48,191
Yeah, I don't know if I can help him.

1222
01:17:51,460 --> 01:17:52,260
Excuse me?

1223
01:17:52,261 --> 01:17:53,829
They put him away...

1224
01:17:55,898 --> 01:17:57,700
Because I thought he was bad.

1225
01:17:59,468 --> 01:18:01,203
And do you still think that?

1226
01:18:01,204 --> 01:18:03,104
I don't know.
I don't know what I think anymore.

1227
01:18:03,105 --> 01:18:04,473
That's the problem, Lauren.

1228
01:18:05,974 --> 01:18:07,542
I was trying to protect you, is all.

1229
01:18:07,543 --> 01:18:09,377
No. No, no, no.
No, I was.

1230
01:18:09,378 --> 01:18:10,913
You were trying to protect yourself.

1231
01:18:16,519 --> 01:18:17,553
You know what?

1232
01:18:19,154 --> 01:18:21,390
Things are good or bad.

1233
01:18:23,626 --> 01:18:25,092
But people,

1234
01:18:25,093 --> 01:18:27,796
sometimes people are just not easy.

1235
01:18:30,366 --> 01:18:32,567
I'm going back to the city for a while.

1236
01:18:32,568 --> 01:18:34,503
You know where to find me.

1237
01:19:13,942 --> 01:19:15,109
Are you sure?

1238
01:19:15,110 --> 01:19:16,478
Pretty sure.

1239
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:18,913
Don't do anything before I get there.

1240
01:19:18,914 --> 01:19:21,015
How far away are you?
Not far.

1241
01:19:21,016 --> 01:19:22,784
All right, I'm going.
And I said...

1242
01:19:22,785 --> 01:19:25,621
Before he does something
to himself or who knows what.

1243
01:19:50,479 --> 01:19:51,514
Danny.

1244
01:19:53,215 --> 01:19:56,285
Her niece lived here
for a while, I heard.

1245
01:20:02,358 --> 01:20:04,493
Danny, that gun's
gonna get you put away.

1246
01:20:08,230 --> 01:20:09,532
It might.

1247
01:20:11,467 --> 01:20:13,468
It's crazy, though, right?

1248
01:20:13,469 --> 01:20:15,403
I mean, I can't even close my eyes

1249
01:20:15,404 --> 01:20:16,972
without seeing her face...

1250
01:20:18,441 --> 01:20:21,409
Upside down right there,
staring back at me,

1251
01:20:21,410 --> 01:20:23,812
even if they burnt
this whole place down.

1252
01:20:26,181 --> 01:20:29,083
Why don't you just
give me the gun, Danny?

1253
01:20:29,084 --> 01:20:29,985
No.

1254
01:20:32,254 --> 01:20:33,688
You know, I thought it was gonna be

1255
01:20:33,689 --> 01:20:36,090
my father who came here first.

1256
01:20:36,091 --> 01:20:37,525
Search and destroy.

1257
01:20:37,526 --> 01:20:40,763
Mr. Miller, that's what he was good at.

1258
01:20:42,331 --> 01:20:44,899
Now, little Danny Miller

1259
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:46,434
kept on coming back here,

1260
01:20:46,435 --> 01:20:48,704
because every time he did, he thought...

1261
01:20:50,373 --> 01:20:51,907
I thought...

1262
01:20:53,642 --> 01:20:57,712
That Lizzie would be walking around,

1263
01:20:57,713 --> 01:20:59,414
feeding her cats.

1264
01:20:59,415 --> 01:21:01,784
"Up and about," that's what
my mother used to say.

1265
01:21:04,353 --> 01:21:06,187
Like none of this happened,

1266
01:21:06,188 --> 01:21:08,856
Lizzie or my mother.

1267
01:21:08,857 --> 01:21:11,960
Danny, I don't know if I ever
told you this before, but...

1268
01:21:14,196 --> 01:21:15,798
When I was a kid...

1269
01:21:17,366 --> 01:21:20,334
Me and some friends,
we pushed this boy in the water,

1270
01:21:20,335 --> 01:21:22,738
and we watched him almost drown.

1271
01:21:24,072 --> 01:21:25,740
You watched.

1272
01:21:25,741 --> 01:21:27,642
See, Tom, that's your problem.

1273
01:21:27,643 --> 01:21:30,512
That's your real problem,
is you like to watch.

1274
01:21:30,513 --> 01:21:32,414
You are a fucking tourist, Tom.

1275
01:21:32,415 --> 01:21:34,582
That's what the rich do.
They tour.

1276
01:21:34,583 --> 01:21:36,918
But he would have drowned
if my father didn't jump in.

1277
01:21:36,919 --> 01:21:38,620
You jumped in to save me.

1278
01:21:38,621 --> 01:21:39,588
Danny...

1279
01:21:41,356 --> 01:21:43,758
Or I guess we could have
gone down together,

1280
01:21:43,759 --> 01:21:46,561
but you saved me, Dr. Seymour.

1281
01:21:46,562 --> 01:21:49,565
Did I tell you that before,
about the drowning?

1282
01:21:50,766 --> 01:21:53,736
Did you know it was me at the river?

1283
01:21:55,237 --> 01:21:56,704
I don't think you did.

1284
01:21:56,705 --> 01:21:57,872
Danny...

1285
01:21:57,873 --> 01:21:59,441
You like to watch, Tom,

1286
01:21:59,442 --> 01:22:01,776
until you don't.

1287
01:22:01,777 --> 01:22:04,078
But people like me
don't have that choice.

1288
01:22:04,079 --> 01:22:06,147
Why didn't you help me?
Why?

1289
01:22:06,148 --> 01:22:07,482
I thought I was, Danny.
Don't lie!

1290
01:22:07,483 --> 01:22:09,150
Danny, put the gun down!
Don't lie!

1291
01:22:09,151 --> 01:22:10,052
Danny.

1292
01:22:13,021 --> 01:22:14,321
Open it.

1293
01:22:14,322 --> 01:22:16,624
Pick it up.
Pick it up.

1294
01:22:16,625 --> 01:22:19,594
Do it, or I'll kill you
and then kill myself.

1295
01:22:19,595 --> 01:22:20,995
Do it!

1296
01:22:20,996 --> 01:22:22,396
Now! Now!

1297
01:22:22,397 --> 01:22:24,433
Do it! Open it!
Okay, okay.

1298
01:22:26,268 --> 01:22:28,335
Pick it up.

1299
01:22:28,336 --> 01:22:29,638
Pick it up!

1300
01:22:34,843 --> 01:22:35,911
Good.
Hold it.

1301
01:22:42,585 --> 01:22:43,819
Danny, why are you doing this?

1302
01:22:46,489 --> 01:22:48,657
Danny, come...

1303
01:23:02,237 --> 01:23:03,705
Don't do this, Danny.

1304
01:23:03,706 --> 01:23:05,040
Danny, don't do this.

1305
01:23:11,379 --> 01:23:12,648
Close your eyes.

1306
01:23:14,416 --> 01:23:16,383
Close your eyes.
Don't do this.

1307
01:23:16,384 --> 01:23:17,986
Close your eyes.
Don't do this.

1308
01:23:31,166 --> 01:23:33,400
Now, that is feeling.

1309
01:23:33,401 --> 01:23:36,037
That is not watching.

1310
01:23:36,038 --> 01:23:36,972
That is feeling.

1311
01:23:38,641 --> 01:23:41,108
Is that what you were afraid of?

1312
01:23:41,109 --> 01:23:44,478
That feeling?
That someone could like that feeling?

1313
01:23:44,479 --> 01:23:47,115
Why?
Because we're killers?

1314
01:23:49,317 --> 01:23:53,655
We are, all of us, killers, Tom.

1315
01:23:53,656 --> 01:23:55,190
But liking it...

1316
01:23:56,592 --> 01:23:58,260
That is a whole 'nother story.

1317
01:24:00,829 --> 01:24:02,664
Did you like how that felt?

1318
01:24:02,665 --> 01:24:04,800
No. No, I didn't.

1319
01:24:08,971 --> 01:24:10,205
Neither did I.

1320
01:24:13,375 --> 01:24:14,977
I kicked her...

1321
01:24:16,444 --> 01:24:17,511
And she fell,

1322
01:24:17,512 --> 01:24:19,848
and she started shaking, and...

1323
01:24:22,585 --> 01:24:25,120
I... I'm sorry.

1324
01:24:43,606 --> 01:24:46,440
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It's okay.

1325
01:24:46,441 --> 01:24:47,910
Danny, it's okay.

1326
01:24:50,913 --> 01:24:51,914
I-It's okay.

1327
01:24:59,421 --> 01:25:01,623
It's my... it's my dad.

1328
01:25:01,624 --> 01:25:03,792
He... he knows where I am, Tom.

1329
01:25:06,394 --> 01:25:08,596
Um, okay, listen.

1330
01:25:08,597 --> 01:25:10,064
Everything's gonna be okay, all right?

1331
01:25:10,065 --> 01:25:12,801
I need you to go upstairs
and stay out of sight, now.

1332
01:25:23,846 --> 01:25:25,412
Get the hell away from the car!

1333
01:25:25,413 --> 01:25:26,848
Just... just back off
and leave him alone.

1334
01:25:26,849 --> 01:25:28,816
I swear I'm so sick
of you fucking idiots!

1335
01:25:28,817 --> 01:25:29,984
Just leave him alone!

1336
01:25:29,985 --> 01:25:32,419
Who do you think told me he was here?

1337
01:25:32,420 --> 01:25:33,688
Ah, bullshit.

1338
01:25:33,689 --> 01:25:34,789
Bullshit, huh?
Argh!

1339
01:25:34,790 --> 01:25:35,990
Bullshit?

1340
01:25:35,991 --> 01:25:36,959
Bullshit?

1341
01:25:38,927 --> 01:25:40,095
Bullshit?

1342
01:25:43,732 --> 01:25:44,833
Huh?

1343
01:25:46,401 --> 01:25:48,302
Huh?

1344
01:25:49,938 --> 01:25:50,939
Ahh!

1345
01:25:55,878 --> 01:25:58,747
He can play you,
but he ain't gonna play me.

1346
01:28:09,511 --> 01:28:11,745
"It's the stories,

1347
01:28:11,746 --> 01:28:14,081
the stories children tell themselves,

1348
01:28:14,082 --> 01:28:18,152
after the event or the act."

1349
01:28:18,153 --> 01:28:21,588
"That's what we work with,
not to punish or accuse,

1350
01:28:21,589 --> 01:28:23,858
but to help them retell their stories

1351
01:28:23,859 --> 01:28:29,263
in a way that gives them hope,
possibility,

1352
01:28:29,264 --> 01:28:31,432
and a future..."

1353
01:28:31,433 --> 01:28:35,436
"Because if you don't believe
a child has a future,

1354
01:28:35,437 --> 01:28:37,205
then why believe in anything?"

1355
01:28:51,786 --> 01:28:53,220
No offense,

1356
01:28:53,221 --> 01:28:54,922
but don't you think you're exploiting

1357
01:28:54,923 --> 01:28:56,490
the kids you're trying to help?

1358
01:28:56,491 --> 01:28:59,226
Um, I think the only person

1359
01:28:59,227 --> 01:29:02,129
that he's exploiting here is himself.

1360
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:03,965
I wouldn't worry about her.

1361
01:29:03,966 --> 01:29:06,433
She got busted for dealing drugs.

1362
01:29:06,434 --> 01:29:08,669
That's her main claim
to fame around here.

1363
01:29:08,670 --> 01:29:09,703
Fuck off.
My God.

1364
01:29:09,704 --> 01:29:11,372
Good friend of yours?

1365
01:29:11,373 --> 01:29:13,875
I thought so.

1366
01:29:13,876 --> 01:29:16,010
I saw the ad in the paper.

1367
01:29:16,011 --> 01:29:17,078
Hmm.

1368
01:29:17,079 --> 01:29:19,113
And this is riveting stuff, Tom, truly.

1369
01:29:19,114 --> 01:29:20,882
Thank you.
Truly, but, um,

1370
01:29:20,883 --> 01:29:23,550
you didn't mention me in your book.

1371
01:29:23,551 --> 01:29:25,819
No, I didn't, not in this one.

1372
01:29:25,820 --> 01:29:27,855
No, I don't think a chapter's
enough for you.

1373
01:29:27,856 --> 01:29:30,858
You need your own book.

1374
01:29:33,828 --> 01:29:35,829
So, Portland, huh?

1375
01:29:35,830 --> 01:29:38,532
Yeah, and in school,
like a million of us.

1376
01:29:38,533 --> 01:29:41,135
It's basically like prison,
except there's, you know, girls.

1377
01:29:41,136 --> 01:29:43,270
So you're good?

1378
01:29:43,271 --> 01:29:44,671
Past and present?

1379
01:29:44,672 --> 01:29:46,974
Yeah.
You know, getting by.

1380
01:29:46,975 --> 01:29:48,609
Forward motion and all that.

1381
01:29:48,610 --> 01:29:50,912
Danny.
There you are.

1382
01:29:50,913 --> 01:29:52,113
Hey, baby.

1383
01:29:54,749 --> 01:29:55,917
Rowena.

1384
01:29:55,918 --> 01:29:58,685
Yes.
Yes, of course.

1385
01:29:58,686 --> 01:30:00,021
You look good.

1386
01:30:00,022 --> 01:30:03,757
Oh, I transferred up here
when Danny did.

1387
01:30:03,758 --> 01:30:06,127
Sorry I missed your talk.
I had class.

1388
01:30:06,128 --> 01:30:07,728
Did you tell him about your story?

1389
01:30:07,729 --> 01:30:09,563
Well, I...
No, he didn't.

1390
01:30:09,564 --> 01:30:11,665
Oh. Well, he's quite talented.

1391
01:30:11,666 --> 01:30:12,866
I imagine he would be.

1392
01:30:12,867 --> 01:30:14,401
It's going to be in the quarterly.

1393
01:30:14,402 --> 01:30:16,003
I don't think he wants
to hear about all that.

1394
01:30:16,004 --> 01:30:17,838
No, it's good and strange.

1395
01:30:17,839 --> 01:30:21,275
It's about this boy who
buys these toy soldiers,

1396
01:30:21,276 --> 01:30:23,010
these made-in-China toy soldiers...

1397
01:30:23,011 --> 01:30:24,711
All right, all right, all right, enough.

1398
01:30:25,713 --> 01:30:27,214
Hey, Ro!
Hurry up!

1399
01:30:27,215 --> 01:30:29,183
I'll see you soon, all right?

1400
01:30:29,184 --> 01:30:30,285
Okay.

1401
01:30:31,619 --> 01:30:32,587
Good to see you again.

1402
01:30:36,992 --> 01:30:40,194
Toy soldiers were from Walmart.

1403
01:30:40,195 --> 01:30:41,095
Excuse me?

1404
01:30:41,096 --> 01:30:43,064
Well, in... in my story,

1405
01:30:43,065 --> 01:30:46,167
the toys, they're from Walmart.

1406
01:30:46,168 --> 01:30:48,735
It's basically... it's about this kid

1407
01:30:48,736 --> 01:30:51,072
who starts messing
with his psychiatrist,

1408
01:30:51,073 --> 01:30:53,207
his former psychiatrist,

1409
01:30:53,208 --> 01:30:55,277
the one that he had when he was a child.

1410
01:30:56,878 --> 01:30:58,913
It's just a story, Tom.

1411
01:30:59,881 --> 01:31:01,548
I'll send it to you.

1412
01:31:01,549 --> 01:31:03,717
Give it a read.

1413
01:31:03,718 --> 01:31:05,619
What's this story called?

1414
01:31:05,620 --> 01:31:06,687
The Tourist.

1415
01:31:06,688 --> 01:31:07,589
Ah.

1416
01:31:09,124 --> 01:31:12,559
Oh, but that's not you
anymore, though, is it?

1417
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:13,995
No.

1418
01:31:13,996 --> 01:31:18,300
I mean, you, you pulled
the trigger, didn't you?

1419
01:31:19,467 --> 01:31:20,601
You almost killed him.

1420
01:31:20,602 --> 01:31:21,636
I thought you would.

1421
01:31:27,575 --> 01:31:29,011
What?

1422
01:31:30,712 --> 01:31:32,313
What the hell is so funny?

1423
01:31:32,314 --> 01:31:34,748
Nothing, man, just people like you.

1424
01:31:37,885 --> 01:31:38,987
I'm sorry.

1425
01:31:40,288 --> 01:31:43,358
Well, look, I gotta get to the airport.

1426
01:31:45,093 --> 01:31:46,628
Can I drop you off someplace?

1427
01:31:48,263 --> 01:31:49,697
Uh, yeah.

1428
01:31:52,767 --> 01:31:55,102
How's Lauren?

1429
01:31:55,103 --> 01:31:56,638
She didn't make the trip with you, huh?

1430
01:31:57,872 --> 01:31:59,641
No, she's working.

1431
01:32:01,809 --> 01:32:03,377
Everything good between you two?

1432
01:32:03,378 --> 01:32:04,445
Mm-hmm.

1433
01:32:04,446 --> 01:32:07,115
She must be due pretty soon,
though, right?

1434
01:32:09,951 --> 01:32:12,419
Yeah, she is.

1435
01:32:12,420 --> 01:32:14,655
Wow.

1436
01:32:14,656 --> 01:32:16,523
Tom, that's great.

1437
01:32:16,524 --> 01:32:18,459
I know that you guys
were trying for a while

1438
01:32:18,460 --> 01:32:20,827
and it was really hard on her, so...

1439
01:32:20,828 --> 01:32:21,995
Congratulations.

1440
01:32:21,996 --> 01:32:23,430
I'm very happy for the two of you.

1441
01:32:23,431 --> 01:32:25,433
How did you know my wife was pregnant?

1442
01:32:29,204 --> 01:32:30,937
I asked you how you knew.

1443
01:32:30,938 --> 01:32:33,240
Tom, we talked on the phone.

1444
01:32:33,241 --> 01:32:36,577
She called me, and we talked.

1445
01:32:36,578 --> 01:32:39,012
She didn't tell you that?

1446
01:32:41,049 --> 01:32:42,983
We didn't talk on the phone, Tom.

1447
01:32:42,984 --> 01:32:45,319
I read about it on Facebook.

1448
01:32:45,320 --> 01:32:48,323
You need to relax.
You're a very tense person.

1449
01:32:49,724 --> 01:32:51,958
It's a boy, though, right?

1450
01:32:51,959 --> 01:32:54,262
Isn't that what they
just told her, a son?

1451
01:32:56,030 --> 01:32:57,898
You're gonna be a father, Tom.

1452
01:32:57,899 --> 01:32:59,134
How incredible is that?

1453
01:33:01,969 --> 01:33:03,471
What are you gonna name him?

1454
01:33:05,173 --> 01:33:06,940
I guess you don't have to
answer that right now.

1455
01:33:06,941 --> 01:33:08,410
You still got some time.

1456
01:33:10,044 --> 01:33:13,815
I have to say I cannot wait to meet him.
