1
00:00:03,773 --> 00:00:05,764


2
00:00:15,093 --> 00:00:19,086
160 Euro, you are crazy!
- 160 Euro is not that much.

3
00:00:21,493 --> 00:00:24,485
Ah, look at me...

4
00:00:24,693 --> 00:00:27,685
Nope, not him! Me, the other one!

5
00:00:28,253 --> 00:00:30,847
Hi, here I am!

6
00:00:31,533 --> 00:00:35,082
A man in his best age.
What a shame.

7
00:00:35,082 --> 00:00:39,132
He could have made a lot 
more people happy.

8
00:00:39,132 --> 00:00:43,650
I could just wake up
out of my coma,

9
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:47,885
and the two fruit loops here
could have

10
00:00:47,885 --> 00:00:51,932
a night out for once.
That's my wife Marlene.

11
00:00:51,932 --> 00:00:57,963
I didn't think she would ever use
that much tissue because of me.

12
00:00:58,493 --> 00:01:00,290
Come here!

13
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:07,928
What's up?
- I just had the impression,

14
00:01:08,373 --> 00:01:12,969
he just plays dead it and watching us.
That would look more like him.

15
00:01:13,533 --> 00:01:17,924
He isn't that wrong about that.
Playing- gambling- is my passion.

16
00:01:17,924 --> 00:01:22,609
The whole life is a game.
For me this is that.

17
00:01:22,609 --> 00:01:25,651
That is me. That was me.

18
00:01:26,613 --> 00:01:29,207
Last Tuesday.

19
00:01:29,653 --> 00:01:34,602
Born 1947, as Jakob Zuckermann.
If that sounds jewish to you,

20
00:01:34,602 --> 00:01:39,084
you are mistaken.
That was not my club.

21
00:01:39,084 --> 00:01:43,132
Until last week.
In my life, I'm Jackie Zucker.

22
00:01:43,132 --> 00:01:46,205
Born a player, born a winner.

23
00:01:49,893 --> 00:01:51,884


24
00:02:00,893 --> 00:02:04,886
Maybe another time.
- Ah, wait a sec. All or nothing!

25
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:10,286
See: I bet my Mazda 420 Coupé.
- Alright!

26
00:02:16,373 --> 00:02:18,364


27
00:02:48,173 --> 00:02:50,767
Bad luck.

28
00:02:52,253 --> 00:02:54,847
Really sorry.

29
00:03:03,773 --> 00:03:07,732
Here, rest is for you. I gotta go,
pay my rent.

30
00:03:07,732 --> 00:03:10,805
Hey, I know your ugly face!

31
00:03:11,773 --> 00:03:16,449
You've been a TV-Star in the East!
- Sports anchor, stupid!

32
00:03:16,449 --> 00:03:19,843
Right! What was your name again?
- Rex Gildo.

33
00:03:19,843 --> 00:03:20,922
Rechy Zucker. You tricked me.

34
00:03:20,922 --> 00:03:23,891
Let off me, stupid!

35
00:03:25,533 --> 00:03:29,412
You see,
I am the born winner.

36
00:03:29,412 --> 00:03:33,771
It's not a matter of luck,
I worked hard for that.

37
00:03:33,771 --> 00:03:37,846
Apple juice, ham actor!
Give me my money back!

38
00:03:38,173 --> 00:03:41,165
Gambled too high.

39
00:03:45,813 --> 00:03:48,805
I'm leaving.
- That's Jackie Zucker.

40
00:03:49,093 --> 00:03:52,051
That was him.
Not yet.

41
00:03:52,051 --> 00:03:56,012
Still I'm in the middle of
my wonderful life.

42
00:03:56,012 --> 00:04:00,451
Up to my neck I'm in the shit,
but I got a great view.

43
00:04:00,451 --> 00:04:04,492
New Game, New Luck,
That's my motto.

44
00:04:04,492 --> 00:04:07,451
Think straight ahead.

45
00:04:11,253 --> 00:04:16,452
Somebody once said:
"You have no chance, so take it!"

46
00:04:19,533 --> 00:04:21,649
New game, new luck!

47
00:04:26,053 --> 00:04:29,489
That was the beginning
of a wonderful week.

48
00:04:29,489 --> 00:04:34,772
Well, I'd say,
it was the best week of my life.

49
00:04:35,773 --> 00:04:39,368
Stupid actually,
that it was also my last.

50
00:04:58,733 --> 00:05:02,692
Jackie, it's over,
tomorrow at noon you're out.

51
00:05:02,692 --> 00:05:07,449
You can't be serious, Marlene!
That's a yellow card. Maximum!

52
00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:10,127
Right?
- Wrong!

53
00:05:10,573 --> 00:05:14,532
Is it my debts?
My 2 months rental fee?

54
00:05:14,532 --> 00:05:18,572
Don't act stupid.
- You think I was playing again.

55
00:05:18,572 --> 00:05:22,612
I ran against a door.
- I want you to leave, period!

56
00:05:22,612 --> 00:05:25,571
So, it's a red one...
- Right.

57
00:05:25,571 --> 00:05:28,691
I'm your husband!
- Don't overdo it.

58
00:05:28,691 --> 00:05:32,686
We are still married.
- Not for long!

59
00:05:32,686 --> 00:05:36,766
Give me another chance.
- Non left. Stop that!

60
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:52,568
Shut up,
you aer such a moron!

61
00:06:14,693 --> 00:06:16,684


62
00:06:20,253 --> 00:06:24,212
You had your appointment today
in our office.

63
00:06:24,212 --> 00:06:27,888
Today? Tomorrow!.
- Today at 9 a.m.!

64
00:06:28,293 --> 00:06:31,808
How are you talking anyway?
Don't be so formal!

65
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:36,489
I'm happy having my son,
visiting me. At least...

66
00:06:37,533 --> 00:06:41,412
What's going on here?
- Schmöker, bailiff.

67
00:06:41,412 --> 00:06:45,930
Your debts up to this day
are 44.500 Euro.

68
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:50,609
And as you didn't take your last
appointment this morning...

69
00:06:50,853 --> 00:06:53,731
Come in please!

70
00:06:57,013 --> 00:07:00,972
Ok, here, we can talk.
- There is nothing left to talk.

71
00:07:00,972 --> 00:07:05,012
From your establishment,
the "Club of the Middle" we cannot

72
00:07:05,012 --> 00:07:09,052
extract that sum.
And as you didn't propose any

73
00:07:09,052 --> 00:07:13,570
reasonable solution,
we have to take you into custody.

74
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:17,931
What? You wanna arrest me?
- As I can see, you packed already.

75
00:07:17,931 --> 00:07:21,449
So we can get going.
- Not so fast...

76
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:25,492
I got the money.
I can give it to you. What?

77
00:07:25,492 --> 00:07:30,522
My borrowers will pay me sunday night.
Monday at 12 I can pay back

78
00:07:30,522 --> 00:07:34,401
all my debts. Altogether... how much?
- 44.500 Euro.

79
00:07:34,401 --> 00:07:38,486
44.500. Really, promise!
- Aha! Lotto, or what?

80
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:43,770
We don#t need to discuss any further,
the Management has decided.

81
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:48,244
There is nothing more we could...
- YOU decided that, son? YOU?

82
00:07:48,244 --> 00:07:50,927
Monday at 12.

83
00:07:51,373 --> 00:07:54,968
I promise on my mother's life.

84
00:07:58,493 --> 00:07:59,243
Ok.

85
00:08:06,173 --> 00:08:08,164


86
00:08:31,853 --> 00:08:35,812
A telegram for Jakob Zuckermann.
Nobody home. May I...

87
00:08:35,812 --> 00:08:40,842
He's just leavinf. Jakob Zuckermann?
Who calls him that? Give it to me.

88
00:08:40,842 --> 00:08:44,892
Wait a second! Who are you?
- I'm his wife.

89
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:47,965
His ex, his future ex-wife.

90
00:Bye:52,453 --> 00:08:54,250
Tschüss!

91
00:08:56,013 --> 00:08:58,732
Oh, my god!

92
00:08:59,533 --> 00:09:02,525
Jackie! I call you later!
- Hi!

93
00:09:03,733 --> 00:09:07,442
What can I do for you?
- I want to register.

94
00:09:07,442 --> 00:09:11,492
We wouldn't even start without you.
At the cash desk, Jackie!

95
00:09:11,492 --> 00:09:14,531
The trouble is...
- The registration fee.

96
00:09:14,531 --> 00:09:18,003
5.000 Euro!
- It's for serious players now,

97
00:09:18,003 --> 00:09:22,848
not a gamblers contest. The prices...
- I know! The contest is a dream.

98
00:09:22,848 --> 00:09:25,811
I'm waiting for years for that.

99
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:29,925
Take a check?
- Ach, come on, Jackie!

100
00:09:30,733 --> 00:09:34,612
You've got 8 hours left.
Get the money,

101
00:09:34,612 --> 00:09:38,328
and we'll meet on friday at 12.
On time!

102
00:09:38,933 --> 00:09:43,165
5 grant, Jackie!
No dream fails for that!

103
00:09:44,493 --> 00:09:46,484


104
00:10:02,533 --> 00:10:05,843
How is your shoulder, Mrs. Kröger?
- Hm...

105
00:10:05,843 --> 00:10:10,529
Lay down, relax.
I'll be with you in a minute.

106
00:10:12,173 --> 00:10:15,210
What's going on?
- I'm in so much pain

107
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:19,252
in my right shoulder.
So,I thought, perhaps...

108
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:23,292
You are sneaking into my office
after 2 years without any life sign?

109
00:10:23,292 --> 00:10:27,571
Lay down for a second...
- Your mother through me out.

110
00:10:27,571 --> 00:10:31,566
She wants to divorce.
- Congratulations for that.

111
00:10:31,566 --> 00:10:35,532
Yeah, I know.
Nice, lovely pictures, really nice.

112
00:10:37,493 --> 00:10:42,442
How is little Sandra?
- Sarah. She is fine. Why?

113
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:46,492
Why? I'm her grandpa!
Or am I not?

114
00:10:46,492 --> 00:10:49,451
Say hello from me, OK?

115
00:10:51,933 --> 00:10:54,811
Ok. On your belly...

116
00:10:56,933 --> 00:10:58,525
Grandpa!

117
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:10,812
Oh, the right shoulder,
totally jammed.

118
00:11:11,493 --> 00:11:14,371
Doing what?
- I fell.

119
00:11:15,253 --> 00:11:18,131
Are you drinking again?
- No.

120
00:11:18,131 --> 00:11:21,729
Your neck is ruined.
- It's the bank.

121
00:11:21,729 --> 00:11:24,691
Gambling again?
- Nonsens!

122
00:11:26,093 --> 00:11:30,052
How is your business?
- Good. Very good, actually.

123
00:11:30,052 --> 00:11:33,011
We can'*t complain.

124
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:37,252
Jana, I have a question.
Just a question,

125
00:11:37,252 --> 00:11:40,325
you can say No any time.

126
00:11:41,093 --> 00:11:45,086
Well, those 10.000 Mark,
that you got from me,

127
00:11:46,413 --> 00:11:50,372
that time, 5 years ago,
when I won the competition in Rostock,

128
00:11:50,372 --> 00:11:55,083
that loan, you remember?
- Loan? That was a gift!

129
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:59,086
"Here dear Jana,
a little jump start for your office."

130
00:11:59,086 --> 00:12:04,372
Yeah, sure, but that was of course...
- Get dressed and leave!

131
00:12:04,372 --> 00:12:08,162
Do you think it's easy for me
to come here?

132
00:12:08,162 --> 00:12:11,131
Out!
- Not like that. Please!

133
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:14,285
Irene, could you?
- What's that?

134
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:18,412
This patient refuses to 
leave my office.

135
00:12:28,533 --> 00:12:31,411
Who was that?
- My father.

136
00:12:38,613 --> 00:12:41,571
May I? Excuse me...

137
00:12:41,571 --> 00:12:45,612
Mom, please...
- Only 2 minutes. 
I need you, Tommy.

138
00:12:45,612 --> 00:12:50,687
I through your dad out,
and now I don't know where he is!

139
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:55,722
Don't ask how hard it was!
He looked so sad, awful!

140
00:12:55,722 --> 00:12:59,806
And today noon the telegram
for him arrived.

141
00:13:00,693 --> 00:13:05,005
From Frankfurt. From his brother.
Samuel. You don't know him.

142
00:13:05,005 --> 00:13:08,085
Me neither.
- What happened?

143
00:13:08,613 --> 00:13:12,606
"Your mother died." Period.
- My mother? But...

144
00:13:12,813 --> 00:13:17,409
His mother, Jackies mother,
your grandmother, for god's sake!

145
00:13:17,853 --> 00:13:21,448
Jackie's mother?
Oh god, that's awful!

146
00:13:21,893 --> 00:13:26,284
What? You didn't even know her.
- Sorry, I just...

147
00:13:26,284 --> 00:13:30,969
One minute, alright? Come with me.
- She wants to be burried here.

148
00:13:31,413 --> 00:13:34,291
What? Where?
- Well, jewish!

149
00:13:34,533 --> 00:13:38,446
At the jewish cemetry, who know!
Where is Jackie?

150
00:13:38,446 --> 00:13:42,162
How should I know that?
- Because you do!

151
00:13:42,162 --> 00:13:47,407
We have an event of death, Thomas!
Where is he, tell me!

152
00:13:47,407 --> 00:13:49,484


153
00:13:57,693 --> 00:14:02,323
Mr. Zucker! I hope the predjudice
with the suitcases not is right,

154
00:14:02,323 --> 00:14:06,292
is our boss homeless!
- Yeah, looks quite like it.

155
00:14:07,373 --> 00:14:11,252
Where is Linda?
- She has an important client.

156
00:14:11,252 --> 00:14:13,210
Ah, I see.

157
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:17,763
Have a cup of tea with me?

158
00:14:17,763 --> 00:14:20,447
Oh god, girl!

159
00:14:21,173 --> 00:14:24,768
The game is hard,
if you are behind.

160
00:14:26,173 --> 00:14:30,166
What? We have to close?
Are we homeless?

161
00:14:30,853 --> 00:14:33,731
Who says that?

162
00:14:33,731 --> 00:14:36,885
Ah, Schmöker? But we are...

163
00:14:37,133 --> 00:14:41,012
It's alright, Mr. Zucker.
- Mr. Schmöker!

164
00:14:41,012 --> 00:14:44,927
Thank you.
- You always meet twice in life.

165
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:48,005
Thanks.
- Jackie, could you?

166
00:14:51,533 --> 00:14:56,004
You're not better than your predecessor.
- No! He stole from you,

167
00:14:56,004 --> 00:15:00,052
I miscalculated, Linda.
- You betrayed me.

168
00:15:00,052 --> 00:15:04,092
Me and my 8 women.
You didn't pay for 12 months!

169
00:15:04,092 --> 00:15:08,451
The club would be gone already,
if I hadn't taken a 300.000 Mark loan.

170
00:15:08,451 --> 00:15:12,492
You shouldn't let a gambler
do the bookkeeping.

171
00:15:12,492 --> 00:15:16,532
Or a nurse do the management!
- Your sarcasm is useless.

172
00:15:16,532 --> 00:15:19,491
We have to close down.
- NO!

173
00:15:19,491 --> 00:15:23,612
On Monday I will have a check
for 100.000 Euro.

174
00:15:23,612 --> 00:15:27,652
Sounds like some kind of cheat.
- No, honestly earned.

175
00:15:27,652 --> 00:15:31,692
Cause I'm the best!
The 5. European Pool Classics...

176
00:15:31,692 --> 00:15:36,688
That's something to win easily like that?
- Yes! It's my time. Skill and Experience!

177
00:15:36,688 --> 00:15:42,450
I haven't lost one game last year 
that I didn't wanna loose!

178
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:46,924
Was a hard job to delay
Mr. Schmöker until Monday.

179
00:15:46,924 --> 00:15:51,006
We are a good team.
- You better win!

180
00:15:53,013 --> 00:15:57,609
I give my life for it.
I'm gonna win, promise.

181
00:15:58,013 --> 00:16:01,005
There is only one tiny...

182
00:16:01,773 --> 00:16:04,367
the registration fee...

183
00:16:06,253 --> 00:16:09,404
My wife! What is she doing here?
She doesn't even know the club!

184
00:16:09,404 --> 00:16:15,170
Jackie! You ruin us all and then
ask me for that fee?

185
00:16:25,053 --> 00:16:29,012
don't get me wrong.
I'm not a client, Marlene,

186
00:16:29,012 --> 00:16:32,324
only the bookkeeper.
- What is that?

187
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:36,088
A Club for lonely heards,
East German nostalgics.

188
00:16:36,088 --> 00:16:39,609
Crying for the past?
- You could say that.

189
00:16:39,609 --> 00:16:44,642
That's how much you miss the GDR?
- Sometimes. At least I was somebody.

190
00:16:44,642 --> 00:16:47,725
Jackie, everything will be alright.

191
00:16:48,253 --> 00:16:51,245
I want you to come back.

192
00:16:52,293 --> 00:16:55,171
Really? Why is that?

193
00:16:55,171 --> 00:16:58,325
Because we have to stick together.

194
00:17:00,773 --> 00:17:03,924
"Your mother died,
our mother.

195
00:17:03,924 --> 00:17:07,005
She wants to be burried 
in native soil.

196
00:17:07,005 --> 00:17:11,166
Contact Rabbi Ginsberg
for funeral. Samuel."

197
00:17:14,213 --> 00:17:17,091
Bring your suitcase.

198
00:17:17,091 --> 00:17:21,405
I won't go to the jewish community!
- Your brother wants you to.

199
00:17:21,405 --> 00:17:25,452
We go there now!
- My brother is a fanatic!

200
00:17:25,452 --> 00:17:29,492
One that's throwing stone on cars
on sabbat in israel.

201
00:17:29,492 --> 00:17:33,805
He's living in Frankfurt. And
you haven't seen him for 40 years!

202
00:17:33,805 --> 00:17:37,852
Your mother died jewish and she
will be buried jewish.

203
00:17:37,852 --> 00:17:40,527
And you'll convert?

204
00:17:40,973 --> 00:17:44,852
The Lord gave it,
The Lord took it.

205
00:17:44,852 --> 00:17:48,608
I really would have liked to
tell her farewell.

206
00:17:49,053 --> 00:17:52,728
She was a very important woman
in my life.

207
00:17:52,728 --> 00:17:57,489
Like a second mom. I hope she
doesn't mind me saying that.

208
00:17:57,489 --> 00:18:02,772
She helped me very much when I 
came to Frankfurt as a young Rabbi.

209
00:18:03,773 --> 00:18:08,403
Rebekka Left her Will as a letter
with me.

210
00:18:08,403 --> 00:18:13,886
She wanted a jewish funeral in 
Berlin-Weißensee.

211
00:18:13,886 --> 00:18:16,851
Do you agree with this?

212
00:18:17,693 --> 00:18:21,288
Of course.
- Your brother will arrive tomorrow

213
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:25,492
10:40 with your mother.
Let's include a delay.

214
00:18:25,492 --> 00:18:30,806
To be save, there are so many planes.
Let's perform the funeral at 1:30.

215
00:18:30,806 --> 00:18:33,487
Tomorrow? So quickly?

216
00:18:33,933 --> 00:18:37,323
As stated by jewish law, 
deaths have to be

217
00:18:37,323 --> 00:18:42,089
burried quickly. We don't keep them
laying around like the Gojims.

218
00:18:42,089 --> 00:18:46,132
Alright, but what about the hearse
and the formalities?

219
00:18:46,132 --> 00:18:50,172
Do we take care of that?
- No, the community will handle that.

220
00:18:50,172 --> 00:18:54,212
You only have to prepare your
appartment for the Shiwa.

221
00:18:54,212 --> 00:18:58,252
Because your mother also ruled that
you and your brother should

222
00:18:58,252 --> 00:19:01,928
siz Shiwa 7 days after that.
- What, 7 days?

223
00:19:01,928 --> 00:19:05,972
How does she expect us to handle that?
- We will manage...

224
00:19:05,972 --> 00:19:09,045
What exactly is a Schibbe?
- Schiwa.

225
00:19:10,053 --> 00:19:13,568
Schiwa.
- We didn#t have a case of death yet.

226
00:19:13,568 --> 00:19:16,645
Schiwa.
- Schiwa, hebrew, means: 7.

227
00:19:16,645 --> 00:19:20,601
The relatives stay at home for 7 days
and celebrate theri grieve.

228
00:19:20,601 --> 00:19:23,685
Great. I like that.
- Samuel Zuckermann

229
00:19:23,893 --> 00:19:27,442
is a very orthodox man.
I don't know, if he will

230
00:19:27,442 --> 00:19:32,004
accept that at your place.
- Ah, we have a big appartment.

231
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:36,052
You live kosher?
- Average kosher, I'd say.

232
00:19:36,052 --> 00:19:40,092
Not exaggerated.
- You separate milk and meat?

233
00:19:40,092 --> 00:19:44,769
You have to kinds of dishes?
You have the Mesusa at your door?

234
00:19:45,573 --> 00:19:47,413
No pork in your fridge?
- Yes, well... No, no pork.

235
00:19:47,413 --> 00:19:49,973
No pork in your fridge?
- Yes, well... No, no pork.

236
00:19:49,973 --> 00:19:54,012
My mother surely told you
how I'm living, hm?

237
00:19:54,012 --> 00:19:58,052
That I'm a godless communist.
- No, she didn't.

238
00:19:58,052 --> 00:20:01,808
My husband is very insecure.
- I'm not!

239
00:20:01,808 --> 00:20:05,488
Doch! We do live kosher,
but we both are not

240
00:20:05,488 --> 00:20:09,532
religious for political reasons.
- The will counts.

241
00:20:09,532 --> 00:20:14,050
You have to talk with your brother.
- You can't talk with him.

242
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:18,092
He's got a bullhead, no brain.
- Maybe I didn't make myself

243
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:22,132
clear enough:
This is your mother's last will.

244
00:20:22,132 --> 00:20:27,241
If you don't want to fulfill this,
you pass on your heritage.

245
00:20:29,493 --> 00:20:31,484


246
00:20:40,613 --> 00:20:44,526
What are you doing?
- Your brother visits us,

247
00:20:44,526 --> 00:20:48,242
to bury your mother.
What's so hard to understand?

248
00:20:48,242 --> 00:20:51,211
436,49.
- It's useless!

249
00:20:51,211 --> 00:20:54,331
It's never too late to 
become jewish.

250
00:20:54,331 --> 00:20:58,008
Hey, Taxi! Hello!
Why doesn't he stop?

251
00:21:00,773 --> 00:21:04,766
Milky and fleshly have to be 
separated in any case.

252
00:21:04,766 --> 00:21:07,447
Milky, milky...

253
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,925
Eggs, are those milky or fleshly?

254
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:18,766
Hey! Fix that at the doors,
on the top right.

255
00:21:23,173 --> 00:21:25,164


256
00:21:27,533 --> 00:21:31,492
Come on, be a man of honor
and pay your gambling debts.

257
00:21:31,492 --> 00:21:34,963
Yeah, the full 500.
- Do you have a minute, Jackie?

258
00:21:34,963 --> 00:21:39,012
Why are they interrupting the 
grief on Sabbat again?

259
00:21:39,012 --> 00:21:43,245
Did you reach Jana?
- She doesn't answer. I'll stop by there.

260
00:21:43,693 --> 00:21:47,845
That's not my first competition!
Don't be so bureaucratic!

261
00:21:47,845 --> 00:21:51,926
You could make an exception for once!
yeah, midnight, cash!

262
00:21:55,253 --> 00:21:57,244


263
00:22:14,253 --> 00:22:16,244


264
00:22:21,213 --> 00:22:25,843
You are so tall already, Sandra!
We could have conversations!

265
00:22:25,843 --> 00:22:30,768
I'm 10, grandpa. And I'm Sarah.
You don't like that name?

266
00:22:30,768 --> 00:22:36,052
I do! Could you tell something to Jana?
From her Mom and Dad?

267
00:22:41,773 --> 00:22:45,004
16...
- Yes! I have the fee!

268
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:50,525
Are you ok, Jackie?
- I'll be glad,

269
00:22:50,525 --> 00:22:54,572
when my mother is in the ground and
that guy has left for good.

270
00:22:54,572 --> 00:22:58,612
Why is he sending a telegram?
Is this the middle ages?

271
00:22:58,612 --> 00:23:03,323
There are phone books! If he could 
even get our address.

272
00:23:03,323 --> 00:23:07,850
But he is too high up, Mr. 
Well-Off-Brother! Dr. Samuel Zuckermann!

273
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:12,165
Too cheap and too coward!
Don't look at each other like that.

274
00:23:12,165 --> 00:23:16,405
You should have heard him, '61!
"They should castrate you!

275
00:23:16,405 --> 00:23:20,452
And Walter Ulbricht!
And all your communists!"

276
00:23:20,452 --> 00:23:24,970
I'm sure he didn't say that!
- No? You are married to the

277
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:29,012
only monster in the family.
- That's gonna be fun...

278
00:23:29,012 --> 00:23:33,052
Don't meddle! I have my issues
with you too!

279
00:23:33,052 --> 00:23:37,888
We better don't talk about that now.
- Stop, stop! i take a taxi!

280
00:23:37,888 --> 00:23:40,931
On the freeway?
- I said stop!

281
00:23:40,931 --> 00:23:45,609
Hold your breath, alright?
- Are you mad?

282
00:23:59,253 --> 00:24:04,168
Dad is drinking the enemy's drink.
- Stop your sarcasm!

283
00:24:04,168 --> 00:24:08,246
Soon he will hit on the girl.
- Are you from the east?

284
00:24:09,013 --> 00:24:11,971
Can't you see that?
- Nope.

285
00:24:11,971 --> 00:24:16,012
You don't look that bad.
- Not starved?

286
00:24:16,012 --> 00:24:20,052
I'm eating west soup for 14 years.
- Youhave to help me, Tommy.

287
00:24:20,052 --> 00:24:23,808
I can't do it alone.
We have to try to be,

288
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:28,330
a normal jewish family.
I know, we are none of that.

289
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:33,362
But we have to act, you understand?
At least for the jewish mother.

290
00:24:33,362 --> 00:24:36,763
I thought you'd say: 
for the heritage.

291
00:24:36,763 --> 00:24:41,449
What have I done wrong with you?
You are getting him!

292
00:24:41,449 --> 00:24:45,526
I was a real star back then,
a real cult figure.

293
00:24:46,373 --> 00:24:49,251
Jackie Zucker. A Rockstar?

294
00:24:49,533 --> 00:24:53,492
Stupid! Sports anchor. Here.
- With signature cards?

295
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:56,167
Why not?
- Wow!

296
00:24:56,613 --> 00:25:00,572
Only, that my father is normal 
at least in that way.

297
00:25:00,572 --> 00:25:05,681
What kind of remark is that?
- I worry about you, my boy!

298
00:25:05,681 --> 00:25:10,369
You meet so many people!
Women as well, even pretty ones.

299
00:25:10,369 --> 00:25:14,526
I mean, you are quite handsome.
- I'm different!

300
00:25:18,693 --> 00:25:22,288
Why didn't you tell me, son?

301
00:25:23,533 --> 00:25:28,732
We would be the last,
to have a problem, if you are...

302
00:25:30,293 --> 00:25:33,649
What did you misunderstand now?

303
00:25:33,649 --> 00:25:37,692
Yes, so I was standing here 14 years
old and had to survive on my own.

304
00:25:37,692 --> 00:25:40,765
Your nose is bleeding.
- That will be gone.

305
00:25:40,765 --> 00:25:45,802
But what's bleeding in here, won't.
Now arriving at gate 8

306
00:25:45,802 --> 00:25:47,333
the delayed flight Dl-473
from Frankfurt.

307
00:25:47,333 --> 00:25:49,483
the delayed flight Dl-473
from Frankfurt.

308
00:25:49,933 --> 00:25:53,892
What does he look like?!
- How should I know?

309
00:25:53,892 --> 00:25:58,125
You recognize your brother, don't you!
- Most likely, he looks like

310
00:25:58,125 --> 00:26:01,410
Osama bin Laden.
- I'm so ashamed.

311
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:05,372
If your brother sees,
how we treat each other.

312
00:26:06,533 --> 00:26:10,526
Tissue! Look at you!
- I'm bleeding!

313
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:17,330
There he is.

314
00:26:20,173 --> 00:26:23,051
Tell me I'm dreaming!

315
00:26:35,253 --> 00:26:38,131
Hello, Jakob.
- Hello!

316
00:26:39,693 --> 00:26:43,686
I recognized you immediately.
Yes, that's how we meet again.

317
00:26:49,013 --> 00:26:52,005
And them? They belong to you?

318
00:26:52,373 --> 00:26:55,843
That is my Family,
Golda, my wife,

319
00:26:55,843 --> 00:26:59,812
my daughter Lilly and Joshua.
- Know them, of course.

320
00:26:59,812 --> 00:27:03,932
Why didn't you inform us that
you'd bring them with you?

321
00:27:03,932 --> 00:27:07,005
I did.
- The telegram says...

322
00:27:08,053 --> 00:27:11,648
"Arrival 10:40."
- Really? Show me that.

323
00:27:13,053 --> 00:27:18,446
"Arriving 10:40, Tegel."
Arriving, Plural! So with Mischpoche.

324
00:27:18,446 --> 00:27:23,482
You and mother, that's also plural!
- Don't worry, we'll stay in a hotel.

325
00:27:23,482 --> 00:27:27,805
Impossible,you stay in our place.
Of course.

326
00:27:27,805 --> 00:27:31,852
Why? They are rich!
- No, that won't be necessary.

327
00:27:31,852 --> 00:27:35,892
We are quite an invasion.
And we all together

328
00:27:35,892 --> 00:27:39,932
have a difficult task ahead of us.
- We are a family!

329
00:27:39,932 --> 00:27:43,972
You stay with us, period!
- If they don't want! In the Forum-Hotel...

330
00:27:43,972 --> 00:27:48,012
That's too expensive, 300 Euro a night.
- No problem.

331
00:27:48,012 --> 00:27:52,052
Ha, you see.
- Don't rude! Thank you.

332
00:27:52,052 --> 00:27:55,125
We are happy to stay with you. 
300 Euro!

333
00:27:57,573 --> 00:28:00,929
Lilly!
- That's too embarassing, Papa!

334
00:28:01,893 --> 00:28:03,884


335
00:28:13,933 --> 00:28:18,529
So, you take that one...
- Joshua! Take care of your mother.

336
00:28:18,813 --> 00:28:22,772
I take that one, I know the way.
- The drivers do as well.

337
00:28:22,772 --> 00:28:26,812
Than you take it!
- No, we will take a taxi.

338
00:28:26,812 --> 00:28:32,843
Then we can discuss the basics.
I will just tell him. Thanks.

339
00:28:38,693 --> 00:28:41,685
Can I join you?
- N, No problem.

340
00:28:42,133 --> 00:28:47,287
Oh, you stutter, cute. What's that?
- That's Dax.

341
00:28:52,533 --> 00:28:56,924
I was so nervous, Marlene.
I couldn't eat at all in the plane.

342
00:28:56,924 --> 00:29:01,006
A full hour. And my husband,

343
00:29:01,613 --> 00:29:05,606
slept like a baby.
The calm before the storm.

344
00:29:09,533 --> 00:29:13,526
Took care of mom so well.
Why did you never reply 

345
00:29:13,526 --> 00:29:17,606
to her letters?
At least after unification.

346
00:29:20,533 --> 00:29:25,527
You are a very nice family.
I expectzed Jakob to be all different.

347
00:29:25,527 --> 00:29:29,606
To be honest, following Samuels
description more like Stalin.

348
00:29:31,453 --> 00:29:34,331
Yes, You wanted to say something?

349
00:29:35,413 --> 00:29:38,405
Ask, maybe... how your mother,

350
00:29:39,253 --> 00:29:42,131
our mom died?

351
00:29:42,333 --> 00:29:45,211
No? And how she lived?

352
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:50,325
Not. So, no further questions.

353
00:29:55,973 --> 00:29:59,932
And your son...
Thomas, what a beautiful name!

354
00:29:59,932 --> 00:30:04,768
Where did he get those muscles?
- Health club. 2, 3 times a week.

355
00:30:04,768 --> 00:30:07,845
And so quiet, secretive.

356
00:30:08,693 --> 00:30:11,685
I'm sure he's a playboy.
- Well...

357
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:19,406
And you, what are you doing?
- I study Law. My 22nd Semester.

358
00:30:22,533 --> 00:30:27,561
But actually I'm a princess.
And my hobby are princes.

359
00:30:35,933 --> 00:30:41,132
There you go! I told you,
we should fly earlier.

360
00:30:47,933 --> 00:30:49,924
[hebrew]

361
00:30:50,693 --> 00:30:53,685
What's going on here?

362
00:31:00,973 --> 00:31:03,965
Where did she hide, your mother?

363
00:31:03,965 --> 00:31:08,126
In the attic of the Metropol-Theater,
here in Berlin.

364
00:31:10,093 --> 00:31:13,688
Follow the hearse, please.


365
00:31:15,493 --> 00:31:19,611
And after Hitler, she stayed in
Germany? As a jew, i mean?

366
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:24,164
Well that's what I call patriotism.
- We'll naever make it!

367
00:31:36,573 --> 00:31:40,532
Jakob! Could you listen a moment?
- I'm not deaf.

368
00:31:40,532 --> 00:31:43,491
We have to delay.

369
00:31:43,491 --> 00:31:47,572
Until tomorrow, 2 pm.
- Tomorrow is friday, impossible.

370
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:51,771
You can't just fix an appointment
without asking!

371
00:31:51,771 --> 00:31:57,803
Stop it! Why can't you?
- I don't owe any explanation.

372
00:31:57,803 --> 00:32:02,284
Which appointment could be more important
than saying goodbye to one's mother?

373
00:32:02,284 --> 00:32:06,605
Did she ever say goodbye to her
14 year-old son? Nope!

374
00:32:06,605 --> 00:32:10,447
How?! Considering how quickly
you built up your wall...

375
00:32:10,447 --> 00:32:15,163
See! I have to save myself tomorrow,
but nobody cares to

376
00:32:15,163 --> 00:32:18,450
coordinating anything with me!
- Please, Jakob!

377
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:22,492
We have to get along now
for a week.

378
00:32:22,492 --> 00:32:26,532
Could you take your hands of me?
- You are even more disgusting

379
00:32:26,532 --> 00:32:30,572
than I though. You became an
even more stinky skunk!

380
00:32:30,572 --> 00:32:35,852
Schmock! Not worth a penny!
Forgive me, Mamele, Forgive me.

381
00:32:39,293 --> 00:32:43,172
Sit down please.
Where are the kids?

382
00:32:43,172 --> 00:32:46,171
They should join as well.

383
00:32:52,533 --> 00:32:56,412
There comes the son.
- Are we waiting for the daughter?

384
00:32:56,412 --> 00:33:00,532
I don't know where she is.
- Why are you looking at me?

385
00:33:00,532 --> 00:33:05,004
You... What did she say?
- That she will try to come.

386
00:33:05,004 --> 00:33:08,449
You know her.
- That's not her style,

387
00:33:08,449 --> 00:33:13,129
she would be calling at least.
- Well, let's make an exception.

388
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:26,529
"For more than 40 years you
are in an ungodly fight.

389
00:33:26,933 --> 00:33:31,882
Now I am dead and take my crying
mother's heart with me.

390
00:33:31,882 --> 00:33:35,966
Let's do it short and quick.
If you, Samuel and Jakob,

391
00:33:35,966 --> 00:33:40,411
get my heritage in equal parts,

392
00:33:40,411 --> 00:33:44,486
which I deposited in my bank

393
00:33:44,486 --> 00:33:48,606
in the form of stocks and bonds?
An acceptable answer to this question

394
00:33:48,853 --> 00:33:54,530
only a collective Yes or No counts.
One Yes, one No is a No."

395
00:33:57,333 --> 00:34:01,292
That's it? The whole letter?
- If you both say No, yes.

396
00:34:01,292 --> 00:34:04,365
I don't say No, you?

397
00:34:05,013 --> 00:34:08,892
In case I say Yes, what's next?

398
00:34:08,892 --> 00:34:12,011
Don't be childish!
- Then I say No.

399
00:34:12,011 --> 00:34:16,450
She will expect you to kiss my 
Tuches! - Tuches is the ass.

400
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:20,128
Nobody blackmails me, I say No.

401
00:34:20,128 --> 00:34:23,131
Is this your last word?

402
00:34:23,533 --> 00:34:27,492
i have lost too much money in
the last 2 years,

403
00:34:27,492 --> 00:34:31,532
as to give up that heritage
just like that.

404
00:34:31,532 --> 00:34:35,083
Especially when my brother is
a bullhead!

405
00:34:35,083 --> 00:34:39,166
Where others have a brain.
- Fine, as you like.

406
00:34:40,693 --> 00:34:44,652
"Hence 5 rules have to  be 
followed by you:

407
00:34:44,652 --> 00:34:49,443
1. After the funeral you will,
following the jewish law,

408
00:34:49,443 --> 00:34:53,412
sit 7 days of Schiwa.
2. Your wives and children may,

409
00:34:53,412 --> 00:34:58,169
join as much as possible.
3. For both of you: there is no

410
00:34:58,933 --> 00:35:02,926
exception except sickness or
death.

411
00:35:03,533 --> 00:35:07,492
4. During Shiwa you should not
just sit silent,

412
00:35:07,492 --> 00:35:12,522
but, with witnesses, discuss
truely and honestly about what

413
00:35:12,522 --> 00:35:16,845
lead to your separation and
hostility.

414
00:35:16,845 --> 00:35:19,811
5. You reconcile.

415
00:35:20,533 --> 00:35:24,526
Witnessed and certified by your
family and rabbi Ginsberg.

416
00:35:24,773 --> 00:35:29,164
If you do not follow those rules,
the heritage will go to a 

417
00:35:29,164 --> 00:35:32,529
charitable jewish organisation."
Aha...

418
00:35:32,529 --> 00:35:36,492
"Your loving mother,
Rebekka Zuckermann."

419
00:35:36,492 --> 00:35:41,249
If I may ask, what is the value
of the package?

420
00:35:41,773 --> 00:35:45,846
May I ask you to help me keeping
the jewish regulations

421
00:35:45,846 --> 00:35:50,324
while I'm gone, Joshua?
- Maybe I am a little too...

422
00:35:50,324 --> 00:35:53,291
biased?
- No, too strict.

423
00:35:53,933 --> 00:35:55,889
A bissel zisareiisch.

424
00:35:55,889 --> 00:35:59,363
You can do it. I suggest

425
00:35:59,363 --> 00:36:05,403
we give the brothers a minute,
to agree or disagree.

426
00:36:08,693 --> 00:36:11,571
All I say is: New Market!

427
00:36:11,933 --> 00:36:14,811
All I say is: Divorce!

428
00:36:18,773 --> 00:36:22,766
Ah, failed investment...
I am so sorry!

429
00:36:24,253 --> 00:36:27,131
Long live capitalism.

430
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:33,212
Who spits up,
will get it into his face.

431
00:36:33,212 --> 00:36:37,252
Considering your financial situation
I wouldn't...

432
00:36:37,252 --> 00:36:40,928
What do you want? 
Are you spying on me?

433
00:36:44,413 --> 00:36:48,372
That was your job, Jakob!
We didn't have a state security.

434
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:52,731
I didn't live in an appartment
rented from them.

435
00:36:52,731 --> 00:36:56,806
That is a lie!
- Lie? I bought the house,

436
00:36:57,853 --> 00:37:01,528
and I know from whom!
- What? That was you?

437
00:37:01,528 --> 00:37:05,572
I pay rental fee to you? Wait!
If you already got the house

438
00:37:05,572 --> 00:37:09,407
for quite about nothing,

439
00:37:09,407 --> 00:37:13,168
with your CDU-connections,
then you should know,

440
00:37:13,168 --> 00:37:17,212
It wasn't state security's property
but state's property!

441
00:37:17,212 --> 00:37:20,968
state's property! You heard wrong!
- Ach, I understand.

442
00:37:20,968 --> 00:37:25,205
Great that you understand for once.
What did you pay for it? One Mark?

443
00:37:25,205 --> 00:37:29,206
But raising the rental fee once a month.
- If I hadn't bought it,

444
00:37:29,206 --> 00:37:33,445
you wouldn't live here anymore,
with your communistic payment style.

445
00:37:33,445 --> 00:37:39,210
I might still live here for
130 East-Mark. Communistic!

446
00:37:39,773 --> 00:37:42,651
13 Mark West, 6 Euro 50!

447
00:37:46,653 --> 00:37:50,646
To our loved mom!
- To our loved mom.

448
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:56,244
The family of your brother is as
kosher as a schweineschnitzel.

449
00:37:56,244 --> 00:38:00,326
Marlene is a Goi! The boy is gay.
And the daughter?

450
00:38:00,773 --> 00:38:04,402
Where is the daughter?
- God Almighty

451
00:38:04,402 --> 00:38:08,168
loves all His creatures, my dear.
- Maybe.

452
00:38:08,168 --> 00:38:12,405
If Joshua find's out about that
we are all finished.

453
00:38:12,405 --> 00:38:15,610
And we even don't know how much.

454
00:38:15,933 --> 00:38:21,132
The 39 tasks forbidden on Sabbat...
Lord, tomorrow night is Sabbat!

455
00:38:21,893 --> 00:38:25,852
I can't do it, Jackie!
You jews, you have too many rules.

456
00:38:25,852 --> 00:38:29,687
There is no space to improvise.

457
00:38:30,253 --> 00:38:34,326
Take care of Marlene.
Help her not to make any mistakes.

458
00:38:34,326 --> 00:38:38,008
I will take care of there 
daughter.

459
00:38:39,453 --> 00:38:43,048
That will distract Joshua.
- What are you talking?

460
00:38:43,533 --> 00:38:46,525
Golda, sleep!

461
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:51,492
I'm not an actress,
I'm a taylor!

462
00:38:51,492 --> 00:38:53,564


463
00:38:53,773 --> 00:38:56,651
You've got to help me, Jackie!

464
00:38:57,013 --> 00:39:00,449
Promise that you stay with me?

465
00:39:00,449 --> 00:39:03,127
Promise! Jackie!

466
00:39:14,773 --> 00:39:17,765
We'll make it.

467
00:39:19,013 --> 00:39:21,004


468
00:39:49,253 --> 00:39:52,245
Hi, Hellooo.

469
00:39:56,293 --> 00:40:00,286
Here they are now. There, milky...
Good morning, my dear.

470
00:40:00,533 --> 00:40:03,411
Hm.
- Jackie! Come.

471
00:40:05,533 --> 00:40:08,525
I need a coffee.
- Take this.

472
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:13,411
Do not come without Jana!

473
00:40:14,533 --> 00:40:19,163
Call me if you can't handle!
- Samuel would like to go to Jana as well.

474
00:40:19,163 --> 00:40:24,247
That's better for all of us.
Let's make no mistake now.

475
00:40:27,253 --> 00:40:30,131
Oh boy, Jakob!
- Yeah...

476
00:40:32,173 --> 00:40:34,164


477
00:40:42,933 --> 00:40:45,811
Who is it?
- Mail!

478
00:40:45,811 --> 00:40:48,851
Mail?
- Our Password.

479
00:40:53,773 --> 00:40:57,766
Nice to see you, Sandra.
Is your mom already...

480
00:40:57,766 --> 00:41:01,846
Sarah, Grandpa! They are still in bed.
- We can come back in an hour.

481
00:41:01,846 --> 00:41:05,892
Who may I announce?
- Oh, Excuse me. I am Samuel,

482
00:41:05,892 --> 00:41:09,568
Jackie's brother.
- Are you uncle Ayatollah?

483
00:41:17,533 --> 00:41:20,411
Yes, that's right.
- I see.

484
00:41:25,173 --> 00:41:28,165
Still headache?
- Of course.

485
00:41:28,533 --> 00:41:31,127
Me too...

486
00:41:32,813 --> 00:41:35,407
Here, Aspirin...

487
00:41:37,093 --> 00:41:39,971
Still the best.

488
00:41:39,971 --> 00:41:42,727
Already opened.

489
00:41:44,933 --> 00:41:46,730
Thanks.

490
00:41:50,733 --> 00:41:55,329
Do you get along well, Jana and you?
- What do you care?

491
00:41:55,533 --> 00:41:59,526
I also have a daughter.
Daughters always mean Zores.

492
00:41:59,526 --> 00:42:04,767
I don't know her lifestyle, for instance.
A woman shouldn't have more men

493
00:42:04,767 --> 00:42:08,812
than fingers on her hands.
How about your daughter?

494
00:42:08,812 --> 00:42:13,842
She also swops that much?
- No, she has her friend for quite a while.

495
00:42:13,842 --> 00:42:16,891
I see.
- Uncle Samuel! I'm sorry,

496
00:42:16,891 --> 00:42:20,852
to meet first time for this
sad reason.

497
00:42:20,852 --> 00:42:23,965
Yes, yes...
- My condolences.

498
00:42:24,533 --> 00:42:28,924
May I introduce my friend?
We are a couple for 2 years now.

499
00:42:28,924 --> 00:42:32,972
Good morning. Sorry,
Don't care about me.

500
00:42:32,972 --> 00:42:37,012
I'm not completely awake.
- Aha, now I get it.

501
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:41,052
So? What? That you 
don't know anything of my life?

502
00:42:41,052 --> 00:42:46,161
Or, how embarassing all this is?
I'm really sorry, dad, that

503
00:42:46,161 --> 00:42:49,928
you had to find out like this.
- I can handle that,

504
00:42:49,928 --> 00:42:54,404
considering all the happiness with you.
Your open arms your loving heard...

505
00:42:54,404 --> 00:42:58,964
What about yours? Still got one?
As long as I trained my lungs out

506
00:42:58,964 --> 00:43:03,012
and jumped the hurdles
for our global recognition,

507
00:43:03,012 --> 00:43:07,052
I was your loved one.
- I never forced you to anything!

508
00:43:07,052 --> 00:43:12,082
No. But when I told you in Magdeburg
that I'm pregnant and in love and

509
00:43:12,082 --> 00:43:16,610
that I can't run the fucking contest,
cause I was pucking all along,

510
00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:20,083
I was dead for you. Until today.
- Nonsense!

511
00:43:20,083 --> 00:43:25,088
Maybe you both have to...
The funeral for your grandma,

512
00:43:25,088 --> 00:43:30,850
our mother, might not...
But actually we are here to...

513
00:43:31,173 --> 00:43:34,051
What is wrong with me?

514
00:43:35,173 --> 00:43:38,051
The Last Will has to...

515
00:43:38,453 --> 00:43:43,049
Oh, I really feel strange!
- Uncle Samuel, everything alright?

516
00:43:44,933 --> 00:43:47,527
He's got a headache.

517
00:43:48,533 --> 00:43:51,411
We all got a headache!

518
00:43:51,411 --> 00:43:54,565
We are the headaches of our time...

519
00:43:58,173 --> 00:44:02,086
I really feel strange.
Your father has poisoned me.

520
00:44:02,086 --> 00:44:05,768
The water...
Or the aspirin...

521
00:44:06,653 --> 00:44:10,328
Maybe I'm allergic!
- Which Aspirin?

522
00:44:10,328 --> 00:44:13,291
That Aspirin...
- Aspirin!

523
00:44:14,773 --> 00:44:17,765
How many did he take?
- One!

524
00:44:18,093 --> 00:44:22,052
I call the ambulance.
- What's the ambulance for?

525
00:44:22,052 --> 00:44:27,366
That takes too much time, the paperwork!
I'll bring him to a friend...

526
00:44:29,933 --> 00:44:31,924


527
00:44:50,413 --> 00:44:53,530
What was that?
- Ecstasy. If we take it,

528
00:44:53,530 --> 00:44:57,447
we take a half together.
- Is that the drug where the kids

529
00:44:57,447 --> 00:45:01,492
dance all through the night?
- Wrap him up.

530
00:45:04,253 --> 00:45:08,212
He took the wrong pill.
Let him release his energy.

531
00:45:08,212 --> 00:45:11,410
'a massage, Lavender, relaxing...

532
00:45:11,410 --> 00:45:14,485
Schalom, Monsieur Zucker.
- Schalom.

533
00:45:14,485 --> 00:45:17,605
May I invite you to a cup of tea?

534
00:45:20,773 --> 00:45:26,450
She knows what's an orthodox jew?
- Of course, she is from palestine.

535
00:45:27,773 --> 00:45:31,732
And how are you?
You must still be on the trip.

536
00:45:31,732 --> 00:45:36,967
I'm great! I gotta go,
in an hour my contest starts.

537
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:40,045
You are the greatest, thanks!

538
00:45:40,533 --> 00:45:42,330
Thanks!

539
00:45:50,333 --> 00:45:52,927
Ach, Jana. You...

540
00:45:53,693 --> 00:45:57,845
You were never dead for me.
I see that the opposite.

541
00:45:57,845 --> 00:46:02,882
You turned your back on me,
cause I was a fool. You were right.

542
00:46:02,882 --> 00:46:06,568
But I still love you.
- You are high!

543
00:46:06,568 --> 00:46:12,729
I'm high, and the funeral is at 2!
- I'll be there. I was there yesterday.

544
00:46:18,853 --> 00:46:22,812
We fought for a long time
to have this highclass

545
00:46:22,812 --> 00:46:26,852
international contest finally
come to Berlin.

546
00:46:26,852 --> 00:46:31,723
Good luck to all of the
contestents.

547
00:46:31,723 --> 00:46:39,806
I herby declare the 5th European
 Pool Classics in Berlin open!

548
00:46:41,133 --> 00:46:43,124


549
00:47:32,653 --> 00:47:34,644


550
00:48:02,933 --> 00:48:06,164
Great!
-You just won the quickest round

551
00:48:06,164 --> 00:48:11,247
in all history of the EPC!
- I'll be back at 4, Eddy!

552
00:48:20,533 --> 00:48:23,411
There they are

553
00:48:26,133 --> 00:48:28,727
But where is Jana?

554
00:48:29,653 --> 00:48:33,646
Maybe they didn't succeed.
- Here I am.

555
00:48:37,093 --> 00:48:39,084
(Hebrew singing)

556
00:48:44,533 --> 00:48:47,525
Then let's go in.
- Yes.

557
00:48:49,533 --> 00:48:51,524
(Hebrew singing)

558
00:49:28,013 --> 00:49:31,892
I am sorry, Mama.
I have to say something.

559
00:49:31,892 --> 00:49:36,962
I have to think of your favorite joke.
After the concert, a jewish mother 

560
00:49:36,962 --> 00:49:41,524
enters the dressing room of the pianist.
"My son plays the piano so well,

561
00:49:41,524 --> 00:49:45,572
you have to support him."
"I never support anyone,"

562
00:49:45,572 --> 00:49:49,612
the pianist said.
"But my son is a genius,"

563
00:49:49,612 --> 00:49:54,608
the mother says and plays a tape.
The Pianist very impressed says:

564
00:49:54,608 --> 00:49:59,642
"He is playing like Horowitz!"
"That is Horowitz," the mother proudly says.

565
00:49:59,642 --> 00:50:03,328
"But my son plays just like him."

566
00:50:05,253 --> 00:50:09,246
You always believed in us, Mamale,
in Jakob and me.

567
00:50:10,093 --> 00:50:14,450
Hw many times you told me:
"Everything will be fine, Samuel."

568
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:19,482
And when the wall came down:
"Now we'll be a family again."

569
00:50:19,482 --> 00:50:23,725
But we disappointed you so strong.
WWhy didn't we tear down the wall,

570
00:50:23,725 --> 00:50:27,772
tat runs through our family,
as well?

571
00:50:27,772 --> 00:50:33,052
Why did you have to die so that
I can stand here with my brother?

572
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:46,927
Jackie! Jackie?

573
00:50:47,373 --> 00:50:49,170
Do something!

574
00:50:49,933 --> 00:50:52,811
Jackie!
Help him!

575
00:50:53,653 --> 00:50:55,245
Come!

576
00:51:02,533 --> 00:51:06,446
I'll bring you to a hospital.
Could be a heard attack!

577
00:51:06,446 --> 00:51:10,003
Stay with the family.
- She'll bring you to the hospital!

578
00:51:11,693 --> 00:51:16,005
It's best to let me out here
and I take a taxi.

579
00:51:16,005 --> 00:51:19,768
Are you crazy?
- Too embarassing after all these years...

580
00:51:19,768 --> 00:51:23,766
I won't let you go alone!
- Where are you going?

581
00:51:23,766 --> 00:51:27,812
For 100 grand you can fake an
attack, right?

582
00:51:27,812 --> 00:51:33,047
Even at your own mother's grave.
Show must go on, right?

583
00:51:48,293 --> 00:51:50,284


584
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:43,330
Thanks.

585
00:52:55,973 --> 00:52:57,964
(Hebrew singing)

586
00:53:09,013 --> 00:53:11,004
(Hebrew)

587
00:53:37,373 --> 00:53:39,364


588
00:53:42,253 --> 00:53:44,244
(Hebrew)

589
00:53:50,693 --> 00:53:52,684


590
00:53:54,933 --> 00:53:59,085
We worried, Jakob.
- I'm sorry. I hope,

591
00:53:59,085 --> 00:54:03,132
you are not angry, but...
- Of course not. We know everything.

592
00:54:03,132 --> 00:54:07,172
Jana told us all.
- It's good they gave you a checkup.

593
00:54:07,172 --> 00:54:10,211
Better be save.
- How does it look?

594
00:54:10,211 --> 00:54:14,684
Not that bad. I should rest
and come back tomorrow

595
00:54:14,684 --> 00:54:18,732
I have to sleep a lot.
It's best to go to bed now.

596
00:54:18,732 --> 00:54:21,691
Yes, that's the best.

597
00:54:25,173 --> 00:54:27,209
Schalom.

598
00:54:29,693 --> 00:54:32,287
How is it going?

599
00:54:33,733 --> 00:54:37,692
Where do you go?
- To the Synagoge. It's Sabbat.

600
00:54:37,692 --> 00:54:41,368
Stay. That's best for all.

601
00:54:43,773 --> 00:54:46,765
You are not pulling a stunt here, right?

602
00:54:47,013 --> 00:54:50,005
Lenchen! If I only could!

603
00:54:51,613 --> 00:54:54,730
Thanks.
- Pleasure.

604
00:54:56,693 --> 00:54:59,287
8 feet right.

605
00:55:10,813 --> 00:55:12,804
(Hebrew)

606
00:55:28,173 --> 00:55:30,164
(Hebrew)

607
00:55:37,053 --> 00:55:39,044


608
00:55:41,653 --> 00:55:43,644
(Hebrew)

609
00:56:03,373 --> 00:56:05,364


610
00:56:21,533 --> 00:56:27,449
"Don't feel well. Going to hospital.
Don't worry. Your Zucker."

611
00:56:27,449 --> 00:56:32,482
No doubt, this is an emergency.
Of course you can call the hospital,

612
00:56:32,482 --> 00:56:35,451
although it's Sabbat. Right, Joshua?

613
00:56:37,053 --> 00:56:39,931
Of course you call!

614
00:57:02,413 --> 00:57:06,292
Ach, you are...
- Sabbat, Schalom, Jakob.

615
00:57:06,292 --> 00:57:11,407
Where are you going now?
- Back to the Synagoge for Ma'ariw.

616
00:57:11,407 --> 00:57:15,930
How are you? You want to join?
- Yes, I really would like to,

617
00:57:15,930 --> 00:57:21,212
but the doctor told me to rest.
- Lilly, come on my dear, it's late!

618
00:57:21,493 --> 00:57:24,929
I'll follow. Thomas will show me the way.
- Jackie!

619
00:57:24,929 --> 00:57:28,972
What took you so long?
I worried a lot.

620
00:57:28,972 --> 00:57:33,012
Yeah, I should have called.
- It's OK. l called.

621
00:57:33,012 --> 00:57:37,006
Although it's Sabbat. In the Charité.
- I wasn't there.

622
00:57:37,006 --> 00:57:39,288
No, you weren'tt.
- They transfered me.

623
00:57:39,288 --> 00:57:43,286
To Zehlendorf, a specialist.
- What did he say?

624
00:57:43,286 --> 00:57:47,810
Doesn't matter. You don't believe me.
- If you are playing a game with us

625
00:57:47,810 --> 00:57:51,852
and think you can run off,
watch out, Zucker!

626
00:57:51,852 --> 00:57:56,324
Why are you so sceptical?
That makes my heart ache!

627
00:57:56,324 --> 00:58:00,691
What hurts me, do you think?
After the mess, Sabbat is over.

628
00:58:00,691 --> 00:58:05,449
then Schiwa starts. You'll be there!
Except, you get another attack.

629
00:58:05,449 --> 00:58:09,526
But I want so see that. Hm?
- You know, you...

630
00:58:13,173 --> 00:58:16,768
Linda, it'S me.
I'm in the quarter finals.

631
00:58:17,173 --> 00:58:21,132
Yes, I could win.
Only, it's getting complicated here.

632
00:58:21,132 --> 00:58:24,444
I need you, yes,
I got an idea.

633
00:58:24,444 --> 00:58:27,127
Damn!

634
00:58:30,093 --> 00:58:32,084


635
00:58:33,093 --> 00:58:35,084


636
00:58:37,533 --> 00:58:40,411
Does it still hurt?
- Hardly.

637
00:58:46,653 --> 00:58:51,249
What do you want from me?
- Ah, you are scared. cute!

638
00:58:56,013 --> 00:58:58,004


639
00:59:01,613 --> 00:59:04,605
They are coming! Lay down!

640
00:59:10,373 --> 00:59:14,491
Always bad luck, that man.
Since unificaiton only bad luck.

641
00:59:14,491 --> 00:59:18,168
I heard even he's a jew now!
- Jackie?

642
00:59:18,853 --> 00:59:21,447
Jackie!
- Go!

643
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:23,889
Quick, go!

644
00:59:23,889 --> 00:59:28,569
Stop! That's my husband? My god!
- Pardon? Who are you?

645
00:59:30,853 --> 00:59:34,812
You should have stayed in hospital!
- But I wanted to stay with you...

646
00:59:34,812 --> 00:59:37,771
Keep the mask on!

647
00:59:39,173 --> 00:59:42,848
Heartattack, where?
- 1st floor, through glass foor, right.

648
00:59:42,848 --> 00:59:45,811
Ok.
- Are you related?

649
00:59:45,811 --> 00:59:49,045
I'm his wife.
- What is his name?

650
00:59:49,045 --> 00:59:52,011
Jakob Zucker, Zuckermann.

651
00:59:52,011 --> 00:59:55,165
Good luck getting out of here.

652
00:59:59,693 --> 01:00:01,684


653
01:00:10,013 --> 01:00:14,052
Hello! I know him!
That's Jackie Zucker!

654
01:00:27,773 --> 01:00:31,732
I'm looking for Jakob Zucker. He was
just brought in with a heartattack.

655
01:00:31,732 --> 01:00:34,691
You are his wife?
- Yes.

656
01:00:34,691 --> 01:00:38,812
He was lucky. 5 minutes later,
and it would have been too late.

657
01:00:38,812 --> 01:00:41,885
Oh, god! Can I see him?
- Alright.

658
01:00:46,133 --> 01:00:50,092
But make it short,
and keep calm.

659
01:00:50,092 --> 01:00:50,842
OK.

660
01:00:53,213 --> 01:00:55,807
Jackie? Jackie...

661
01:00:57,253 --> 01:01:02,452
Can you hear me? I'm so sorry
I didn't trust you!

662
01:01:02,452 --> 01:01:06,446
But you are such a 
professional liar.

663
01:01:06,446 --> 01:01:10,412
I even love you for that,
damn fool!

664
01:01:10,412 --> 01:01:14,566
I love you!
- Mrs. Zucker, that's not your husband.

665
01:01:14,566 --> 01:01:18,123
What?
- There is no Zucker brought in.

666
01:01:18,123 --> 01:01:23,412
Not even in the other stations.
We called them.

667
01:01:24,533 --> 01:01:27,411
I'm sorry...
- Yes. Ha!

668
01:01:34,693 --> 01:01:37,685
I was looking for you!
- How is he?

669
They brought him to bacteriological
station, spanish flu, maybe.

670
01:01:43,933 --> 01:01:46,811
Kids, go! Only 5 more minutes!

671
01:01:47,533 --> 01:01:51,970
Didn't you have red hair when
you were a secretary?

672
01:01:51,970 --> 01:01:56,012
In Jackie's sport's editorial office.
I forgot your name.

673
01:01:56,012 --> 01:02:00,689
Linda. Yes, I'm Linda.
- You still look great.

674
01:02:02,693 --> 01:02:06,447
That's impossible!
- We cannot change all the

675
01:02:06,447 --> 01:02:10,492
rules just for you.
the winner is Matzjak. Sorry!

676
01:02:10,492 --> 01:02:14,532
My mother died.
We burried her yesterday.

677
01:02:14,532 --> 01:02:18,572
And my brother came for a visit.
An orthodox.

678
01:02:18,572 --> 01:02:22,851
Are you doing it cause I'm jewish?
- You be what you wanna be!

679
01:02:22,851 --> 01:02:26,892
You were 20 minutes late.
- 16! Tell me, if you have problems with jews!

680
01:02:26,892 --> 01:02:30,886
Beat it!
I have no problems with jews,

681
01:02:30,886 --> 01:02:34,932
as long as they don't annoy me!
- I need that money, Eddy!

682
01:02:34,932 --> 01:02:38,972
Else I go to jail.
I lost my family.

683
01:02:38,972 --> 01:02:42,489
At first in the holocaust...
- Jackie, I like you,

684
01:02:42,489 --> 01:02:45,565
but I can't make an exception!

685
01:02:47,533 --> 01:02:51,924
I would have won the contest,
as sure as death and taxes.

686
01:02:51,924 --> 01:02:55,972
So you would have won against me?
- Against you? Blind!

687
01:02:55,972 --> 01:03:00,046
You are good but predictable.
You play like a bureaucrate.

688
01:03:02,093 --> 01:03:05,688
I propose: 14:1, no time limit.
Until 100 points.

689
01:03:06,133 --> 01:03:10,092
Each point counts 1.000 Euro.
But only for the winner.

690
01:03:10,092 --> 01:03:14,132
 No risk no fun.
tomorrow, midnight, after the finals.

691
01:03:14,132 --> 01:03:17,091
What do you say?
- How much?

692
01:03:17,533 --> 01:03:21,128
You have no money,
I heard that much.

693
01:03:21,128 --> 01:03:26,930
Let's say 10.000 from you, 90 from me.
The winner get's the 100.000 Euro.

694
01:03:27,933 --> 01:03:30,527
Is that fair?

695
01:03:31,693 --> 01:03:35,572
Thinking is expensive.
I wanna play not calculate!

696
01:03:35,572 --> 01:03:39,692
20, for you 20, for me 80.
The chances...

697
01:03:39,692 --> 01:03:43,766
OK, OK, OK!
Midnight, in my club.

698
01:03:49,173 --> 01:03:51,164


699
01:04:16,533 --> 01:04:21,482
This is it with the heart problems,
promise!

700
01:04:21,482 --> 01:04:24,565
What about the spanish flu?

701
01:04:26,253 --> 01:04:29,131
What?
- The virus, do you ot it?

702
01:04:29,533 --> 01:04:34,448
Did it damage your heart?
- No, I don't have the virus, why?

703
01:04:34,448 --> 01:04:38,446
Ah, thank god!
We can sit Shiwa then?

704
01:04:38,446 --> 01:04:43,482
That's why I came home.
- I suggest, we start our

705
01:04:43,482 --> 01:04:47,930
reconciliation talks tomorrow,
if that's ok with you, Jackie. OK?

706
01:04:47,930 --> 01:04:51,005
I'm always, you know...

707
01:04:53,213 --> 01:04:55,204


708
01:05:29,653 --> 01:05:34,249
So just start!
- Yeah, start! Just talk!

709
01:05:37,253 --> 01:05:41,132
Do we have to stay also when they
don't talk?

710
01:05:41,132 --> 01:05:45,252
She's right. Maybe you have to be
alone for starters,

711
01:05:45,252 --> 01:05:49,292
to get going.
- The letter says so.

712
01:05:49,292 --> 01:05:53,366
Everyone should be there. If possible.
- Right! Should, not must!

713
01:05:53,933 --> 01:05:56,891
Not even all of us are here.

714
01:05:56,891 --> 01:06:00,568
Mother said you don't like
each other.

715
01:06:01,013 --> 01:06:04,972
but you have to get along,
else you don't get the money.

716
01:06:04,972 --> 01:06:07,647
Is that right?

717
01:06:09,253 --> 01:06:12,245
Dad? Are you ok? 
Something wrong?

718
01:06:14,493 --> 01:06:17,485
Jakob...
- l have a cramp.

719
01:06:19,093 --> 01:06:21,084


720
01:06:22,133 --> 01:06:25,728
Don't believe him anything!
Don't let him go!

721
01:06:28,933 --> 01:06:32,926
Jackie! The game is over!
- Which game?!

722
01:06:32,926 --> 01:06:35,891
Yours! Now it's my turn.

723
01:06:35,891 --> 01:06:39,648
You wanna know what kind
of people we are.

724
01:06:40,093 --> 01:06:44,052
We are a completely broken family.
I have my business.

725
01:06:44,052 --> 01:06:48,046
He has his business.
I never wanted to know what kind.

726
01:06:48,046 --> 01:06:52,092
But without our son Thomas, he 
would have been in jail already.

727
01:06:52,092 --> 01:06:56,086
Both children had no more
interest in him.

728
01:06:56,086 --> 01:07:00,610
I wanted to get a divorce. I wanted 
to throw him out when your telegram came.

729
01:07:00,610 --> 01:07:04,652
I tought it's a sign from heaven,
that Jackie might change,

730
01:07:04,652 --> 01:07:09,443
if both of you reconcile. But no...
My husaband cheats us all.

731
01:07:09,443 --> 01:07:13,492
The heart attack yesterday,
the ambulance: all fake!

732
01:07:13,492 --> 01:07:17,452
The heart pain, the doctor: Lies!
It was all a lie!

733
01:07:17,452 --> 01:07:22,163
He doesn't want to risk the heritage
but still do his dirty business.

734
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:27,452
I'm sorry, but my husband is a
ruthless, heartless gambler!

735
01:07:27,452 --> 01:07:31,526
Alright, I'll talk about my secret
business, Marlene.

736
01:07:31,853 --> 01:07:35,812
If that's OK. Lokk at me,
you Frank sausages!

737
01:07:35,812 --> 01:07:40,569
Here is the typical unification-looser.
Done everything wrong, lost everything.

738
01:07:40,569 --> 01:07:43,611
The only thing I still can earn money
with is billard.

739
01:07:43,611 --> 01:07:48,084
And just this weekend there is the
biggest contest here in Berlin.

740
01:07:48,084 --> 01:07:52,132
My dream contest!
With a chance for 100.000 Euro.

741
01:07:52,132 --> 01:07:56,172
And I just happen to need that money.
Maybe on Monday!

742
01:07:56,172 --> 01:08:00,246
So I don't go to jail.
But the worst is:

743
01:08:00,773 --> 01:08:05,449
I owe it to 8 women in my club,
who trusted me,

744
01:08:05,449 --> 01:08:09,765
and who will loose their jobs,
their income. Understand?

745
01:08:09,765 --> 01:08:13,448
But no, Jackie, that's quite bad luck.

746
01:08:13,448 --> 01:08:17,526
And then your mother dies,
The funeral, the Schiwa...

747
01:08:18,773 --> 01:08:23,732
Hey, do you think I don't care
at all that mom died?

748
01:08:23,732 --> 01:08:26,408
Marlene, do you really think,

749
01:08:26,853 --> 01:08:30,846
I would do that game,
if I didn't have to?

750
01:08:32,933 --> 01:08:36,926
Yesterday's match didn't
work out unfortunately.

751
01:08:37,533 --> 01:08:41,128
I was too late.
I got disqualified.

752
01:08:41,573 --> 01:08:44,167
Come here, Sandra.

753
01:08:44,613 --> 01:08:48,845
Why haven't you told us?
We are your Mischpoche!

754
01:08:48,845 --> 01:08:52,528
Do you think we wouldn't
have understood?

755
01:08:54,173 --> 01:08:57,051
There is one more chance.

756
01:08:58,933 --> 01:09:04,087
That came to me like from God himself.
A Ukrainian offered me a private game.

757
01:09:04,087 --> 01:09:08,166
Tonight, 20.000 Euro...
- I knew there is more to come!

758
01:09:08,166 --> 01:09:12,246
New Game new Luck, right?
- Jackie! Jackie!

759
01:09:13,533 --> 01:09:17,128
Stop playing,
if this is a game!

760
01:09:17,573 --> 01:09:21,532
He doesn't even play!
That's an organic problem,

761
01:09:21,532 --> 01:09:25,572
If dad can't play,

762
01:09:25,572 --> 01:09:29,612
it breaks his heart.
Better he plays than he dies.

763
01:09:29,612 --> 01:09:33,845
If we all keep quiet...
- That's a diregard to the Schiwa!

764
01:09:33,845 --> 01:09:38,131
It's for Jakob's life, his health.
Exceptions are possible.

765
01:09:38,131 --> 01:09:42,491
He should go to hospital then!
- It is a vital business!

766
01:09:42,491 --> 01:09:46,202
That is allowed as well!
- Grandma's rules only accept

767
01:09:46,202 --> 01:09:49,968
the exceptions "Sickness and Death".
Do you think,

768
01:09:49,968 --> 01:09:55,411
I haven't seen through this jewish
acting? I accept it,

769
01:09:55,411 --> 01:10:00,089
because I thought he is honest.
From the beginning Uncle Jakob

770
01:10:00,089 --> 01:10:04,610
broke the rules. You could say:
"We didn't know."

771
01:10:04,610 --> 01:10:08,652
But as confidants,we cheat as well.
I will not participate in that!

772
01:10:08,652 --> 01:10:10,724


773
01:10:14,213 --> 01:10:18,809
What will he do now?
- Go to the rabbi and report.

774
01:10:20,853 --> 01:10:23,731
Joshua! Joshua, wait!

775
01:10:28,533 --> 01:10:31,127
Joshua, please!

776
01:10:34,373 --> 01:10:37,365
Joshua! Boy, please wait!

777
01:10:41,173 --> 01:10:44,848
Joshua, please don't!
That's a stupid role.

778
01:10:44,848 --> 01:10:48,892
It doesn't even suit you!
- One has to play it

779
01:10:48,892 --> 01:10:52,932
in this kosher family!
I loved my grandma.

780
01:10:52,932 --> 01:10:56,972
But on her grave they dance for money.
It's a shame before God.

781
01:10:56,972 --> 01:11:01,046
I am so sorry,
what became of you, Joshua.

782
01:11:02,133 --> 01:11:05,728
Yes, you are right,
we broke the rules.

783
01:11:06,173 --> 01:11:11,850
Yes, my father lies and cheats, and all
of them also think of the money.

784
01:11:12,173 --> 01:11:16,132
Cause it's a lot, right?
But what does your heart say?

785
01:11:16,132 --> 01:11:19,808
It cannot see that Jackie has
an emergency?

786
01:11:20,253 --> 01:11:24,531
He's got problems, a lot, Josh.
More than me and more than you.

787
01:11:24,531 --> 01:11:29,004
You know what's most funny about it?
That I'm on his side,

788
01:11:29,004 --> 01:11:35,043
although we are apart,
since he destroyed our love.

789
01:11:35,043 --> 01:11:38,051
You were f... full age.

790
01:11:38,533 --> 01:11:42,412
Your father made you decide:

791
01:11:42,773 --> 01:11:46,004
Him, his sport and love, or me.
- Yes.

792
01:11:46,004 --> 01:11:50,052
And you made a decision.
- Both of us! You ran of!

793
01:11:50,052 --> 01:11:53,125
And you ran to god.
- What?

794
01:11:53,373 --> 01:11:56,968
Yeah, and I got our daughter.

795
01:12:13,933 --> 01:12:17,528
Joshua! Hello? Joshua! 
Don't do something crazy!

796
01:12:21,173 --> 01:12:24,165
Dad?
- What else do you wanna do to me?

797
01:12:26,413 --> 01:12:30,406
Where did you get tbe 20.000 Euro from?
- I don't have it.

798
01:12:31,533 --> 01:12:35,412
The Russian guy,
you are playing against,

799
01:12:35,412 --> 01:12:40,169
is he a good player?
- Why? What are you saying?

800
01:12:40,493 --> 01:12:44,372
We decided that you should play,

801
01:12:50,853 --> 01:12:54,448
If, of course, Jana can stop
Joshua.

802
01:12:56,693 --> 01:12:59,685
You better get some sleep.

803
01:13:09,213 --> 01:13:11,204


804
01:13:24,013 --> 01:13:26,607
11
- Yes.

805
01:13:30,493 --> 01:13:33,087
The 2
- Ja.

806
01:13:39,253 --> 01:13:41,050
10

807
01:13:46,173 --> 01:13:47,970
One

808
01:13:50,533 --> 01:13:52,330
The 9

809
19

810
01:14:03,413 --> 01:14:05,404


811
01:14:16,533 --> 01:14:17,283
13

812
01:14:23,693 --> 01:14:25,490
The 6

813
01:14:27,413 --> 01:14:29,210
The 9.

814
01:14:30,613 --> 01:14:32,410
10.

815
01:14:35,293 --> 01:14:37,090
14.

816
01:14:46,733 --> 01:14:49,327
1.
- Yeah.

817
01:15:05,933 --> 01:15:07,924


818
01:15:14,213 --> 01:15:16,681
Jakob?

819
01:15:24,253 --> 01:15:28,212
That was my last week.
For nearly 12 hours I'm

820
01:15:28,212 --> 01:15:32,252
lying in traumatic coma
and wait for a decision.

821
01:15:32,252 --> 01:15:36,008
Somebody up there can't
make a decision,

822
01:15:36,008 --> 01:15:39,847
If Jackie Zucker did win or
loose the game.

823
01:15:39,847 --> 01:15:43,846
If I lost:
Is there life after death?

824
01:15:43,846 --> 01:15:47,812
New game new luck,
even when you're dead?

825
01:15:51,413 --> 01:15:55,406
You are not dead. Hear me?
I'm sorry, Jakob,

826
01:15:55,406 --> 01:16:00,402
that you take the Shiwa so serious. 
Don't worry.

827
01:16:00,402 --> 01:16:04,452
The letter of your mother will
make your life better,

828
01:16:04,452 --> 01:16:08,765
you will not loose it.
Don't be scared of the Schiwa.

829
01:16:08,765 --> 01:16:12,812
You haven't lost anything yet.
- What day is it?

830
01:16:12,812 --> 01:16:15,487
Monday.
- What time is it?

831
01:16:15,933 --> 01:16:18,891
12:05.
- How long will I live?

832
01:16:18,891 --> 01:16:22,568
Long time, I'm afraid.
- l have to go to jail.

833
01:16:22,568 --> 01:16:25,531
Jail?
- Ah, nonsense!

834
01:16:25,813 --> 01:16:29,772
Unlucky at cards, lucky in love,
Ukrainians say.

835
01:16:29,772 --> 01:16:33,812
I would have won by the rules,
cause you used your hands

836
01:16:33,812 --> 01:16:37,852
for the last shot.
But who wants to win like that?

837
01:16:37,852 --> 01:16:42,882
Not me. This game has no winner.
Let's do fifty-fifty. Ok?

838
01:16:42,882 --> 01:16:46,852
I payed your debts with your half.

839
01:16:46,852 --> 01:16:49,851
44.500 Euro. That's the rest.

840
01:16:51,413 --> 01:16:54,405
You must be Jackie's wife.
- Yes.

841
01:16:55,173 --> 01:17:00,611
Your husband is a phantastic player.
The first days, Friday, Saturday,

842
01:17:00,611 --> 01:17:04,686
I thought I'd have no chance,
this guy would beat me! Yes?

843
01:17:04,973 --> 01:17:08,886
How could I have known that
this master player

844
01:17:08,886 --> 01:17:13,569
had to burry his mother
at the same time?

845
01:17:14,533 --> 01:17:19,527
You don't just make me a fool
but also your mother.

846
01:17:19,527 --> 01:17:24,562
I think your mother would want
you to loose the heritage.

847
01:17:24,562 --> 01:17:27,531
My honest regrets for

848
01:17:27,531 --> 01:17:31,925
the ignored Will of your mother
and the broken Schiwa.

849
01:17:31,925 --> 01:17:35,972
But, my honest happiness
for my jewish community that will

850
01:17:35,972 --> 01:17:41,252
benefit from the heritage. Schalom!
- Rabbi! I'm sorry.

851
01:17:42,613 --> 01:17:45,491
Mr. Ginsberg!
- Samuel!

852
01:17:47,213 --> 01:17:51,172
My husband gave everything to
keep the Shiwa.

853
01:17:51,172 --> 01:17:55,212
And now he has a heart attack!
And you call yourself neutral?

854
01:17:55,212 --> 01:17:59,969
As the beneficiary of your decision?
- His mother gave us the rules.

855
01:17:59,969 --> 01:18:04,285
He accepted them and broke them.
- Which rules did he break?

856
01:18:04,285 --> 01:18:08,048
The Shiwa has...
- Do I have to tell you?

857
01:18:08,048 --> 01:18:12,092
He faked a heart attack at his
mother's grave!

858
01:18:12,092 --> 01:18:16,132
He went gambling at Sabbat!
He lied and lied and lied!

859
01:18:16,132 --> 01:18:20,172
No! Rebekka's Will was not that!
- She wants peace

860
01:18:20,172 --> 01:18:24,246
between Jakob and Samuel. Right?
- Yes, that's right.

861
01:18:25,013 --> 01:18:27,004


862
01:18:31,533 --> 01:18:35,685
Peace is a strong word for what
is connecting us now.

863
01:18:35,685 --> 01:18:39,402
But, so what?
The rabbi believed it.

864
01:18:39,402 --> 01:18:43,930
He is giving us a last chance to
fulfill mother's Last Will.

865
01:18:43,930 --> 01:18:47,972
The Shiwa should continue here, in 
our 2-bed-room.

866
01:18:47,972 --> 01:18:51,045
Samuel and me should reconcile.

867
01:18:51,533 --> 01:18:56,687
Nothing easier than that,
after all we've been through.

868
01:18:56,687 --> 01:19:01,642
First, we extend our 40 years of
silence by 2 more days.

869
01:19:01,642 --> 01:19:03,724
(Hebrew)

870
01:19:05,093 --> 01:19:10,372
My family will try to use that
time as much as possible.

871
01:19:10,372 --> 01:19:12,444


872
01:19:26,173 --> 01:19:31,008
The poor boy, nobody can save you
from that kind of experience.

873
01:19:31,008 --> 01:19:36,770
If noboday else does it, why not
the cousin? It's legal, I mean.

874
01:20:07,533 --> 01:20:10,491
And how...

875
01:20:10,491 --> 01:20:13,041
How was I doing?

876
01:20:17,653 --> 01:20:20,645
Like an amateur.

877
01:20:21,773 --> 01:20:23,570
Aigo.

878
01:20:32,573 --> 01:20:35,451
That was my first time.

879
01:20:40,013 --> 01:20:45,212
Quite old for the first time.
- Because I'm quite ro...

880
01:20:46,533 --> 01:20:49,525
romantic.
- I don't mind.

881
01:20:51,533 --> 01:20:55,492
While Samuel and me are lying
unsuspectingly in hospital,

882
01:20:55,492 --> 01:20:58,965
the mice are dancing 
on the table at home.

883
01:21:01,693 --> 01:21:04,685
Bytheway I'm your father, Sarah.

884
01:21:06,853 --> 01:21:10,448
I thought so. And what does
that mean?

885
01:21:10,933 --> 01:21:14,926
That means Joshua and me loved
each other very much once.

886
01:21:15,493 --> 01:21:18,371
And you came out of this.

887
01:21:19,213 --> 01:21:23,172
Why you never told me?
I'm already 10!

888
01:21:23,172 --> 01:21:27,212
There are things that take so long
because they are so complicated.

889
01:21:27,212 --> 01:21:31,684
And some things are so complicated
because they take so long.

890
01:21:31,684 --> 01:21:35,732
My future daughter-in-law is
right about that.

891
01:21:35,732 --> 01:21:39,772
Real problems have to take time.
Men like us have the

892
01:21:39,772 --> 01:21:43,812
right breath for that.
women are much too hectic.

893
01:21:43,812 --> 01:21:47,852
2 more days and the Shiwa is over!
And nothing changed!

894
01:21:47,852 --> 01:21:51,528
Doch, we get along well.
- I don't know,

895
01:21:51,528 --> 01:21:55,572
if I am healthy enough for that.
- Your are very healthy!

896
01:21:55,572 --> 01:21:59,612
I didn't know you've got that
kind of strength in you!

897
01:21:59,612 --> 01:22:04,687
And you lie without turning red,
maybe even now you're faking it.

898
01:22:04,687 --> 01:22:08,766
I promise, to heaven and hell,
if you don't open

899
01:22:09,013 --> 01:22:13,450
your bloddy damn mouth!
- I think that's enough.

900
01:22:13,450 --> 01:22:16,525
They got the message.

901
01:22:19,333 --> 01:22:24,612
I want you to repeat what you told
me when you were high.

902
01:22:24,612 --> 01:22:29,892
What did I say?
- I surely won't tell you.

903
01:22:29,892 --> 01:22:34,968
Well, I must have said that you've
never been dead to me, and that

904
01:22:34,968 --> 01:22:38,932
I always love you, stuff like that.
- Bravo!

905
01:22:39,653 --> 01:22:42,531
Bravo!
- Yes, go on, Jackie!

906
01:22:43,533 --> 01:22:46,411
Hm? It's working.
- Come on.

907
01:23:08,853 --> 01:23:11,731
I'm sorry, Samuel.

908
01:23:14,053 --> 01:23:17,045
Did you say something?
- I am sorry!

909
01:23:17,413 --> 01:23:21,406
Stop it, I don't believe one word.
- I'm sorry for you.

910
01:23:21,613 --> 01:23:25,572
You think, you do everything right,
have nothing to explain,

911
01:23:25,572 --> 01:23:28,645
from your side for once, hu?

912
01:23:28,973 --> 01:23:32,932
Who just ran of that time?
From here, from home?

913
01:23:32,932 --> 01:23:36,972
Mother with her favorite son.
Did you never think how

914
01:23:36,972 --> 01:23:41,968
that felt for me? Hm?
Left alone here?

915
01:23:41,968 --> 01:23:46,012
14 years old, behind walls?
-Ah, stop that!

916
01:23:46,012 --> 01:23:50,052
You know very well, I needed my
leg fixed in Frankfurt.

917
01:23:50,052 --> 01:23:54,285
Ha, "alone, behind walls".
You wanted to stay in sports college,

918
01:23:54,285 --> 01:23:58,332
when they built the fucking wall!
Can you imagine,

919
01:23:58,332 --> 01:24:02,452
how mom suffered because of you?
It was your decision.

920
01:24:02,452 --> 01:24:07,482
We had to accept it.
Socialism was more important than us.

921
01:24:07,482 --> 01:24:11,452
Let's not talk politics.
Fact is that

922
01:24:11,452 --> 01:24:15,572
you never visited me.That's how
stubborn our family is.

923
01:24:15,572 --> 01:24:19,646
Until death.
This was our home! Samuel, here!

924
01:24:20,933 --> 01:24:24,892
We've been a real family.
Even after father's death.

925
01:24:24,892 --> 01:24:28,932
I might have needed you from
time to time.

926
01:24:28,932 --> 01:24:33,006
Not because of the West-Mark!
Come here, grumpy.

927
01:24:33,533 --> 01:24:37,526
Why don't you come?
- Cause I had a heard attack

928
01:24:37,526 --> 01:24:40,685
and you a circulatory collapse 
bullhead!

929
I can't deny that

930
01:25:11,773 --> 01:25:15,891
I also think of the lovely
heritage at that moment.

931
01:25:15,891 --> 01:25:18,965
Also, not more. As all of us.

932
01:25:19,373 --> 01:25:23,252
My whole Mischpoche!
See us sitting there,

933
01:25:23,252 --> 01:25:27,372
all tension head to toes,
how much are the bonds

934
01:25:27,372 --> 01:25:31,492
of our beloved mother.
Don't get me wrong, mom,

935
01:25:31,492 --> 01:25:35,532
but I can't put anything past you.
A chip of the old block.

936
01:25:35,532 --> 01:25:38,605
Pardon?
- New game, new luck,

937
01:25:38,933 --> 01:25:41,527
my dear Jakele.

938
01:25:42,413 --> 01:25:46,406
I had a long sleepless night.
Let's make it quick.

939
01:25:48,773 --> 01:25:52,732
Let's split the heritage in 
2 halfs, one for the brothers

940
01:25:52,732 --> 01:25:56,806
one for the community.
Any complaints?

941
01:25:57,533 --> 01:26:01,321
A motivation.
- I think it's a good solution.

942
01:26:01,321 --> 01:26:05,691
Motivation? Temper justice with mercy.
Following the rules strictly

943
01:26:05,691 --> 01:26:09,732
you would have gone empty handed.
Do you think so too, Joshua?

944
01:26:09,732 --> 01:26:13,408
Yes, of course.
- Then we agree.

945
01:26:15,013 --> 01:26:18,972
I look forward to a few new
friends in our community

946
01:26:18,972 --> 01:26:23,649
And a few less foes.
Well, now I'm excited.

947
01:26:29,013 --> 01:26:32,608
Good Day, Rabbi Ginsbergaus Berlin.

948
01:26:33,173 --> 01:26:36,051
Account No: 44-88-53-77.

949
01:26:39,173 --> 01:26:41,767
Yes, I'm waiting.

950
01:26:52,333 --> 01:26:55,211
Thanks. Thank you very much.

951
01:26:59,253 --> 01:27:03,849
It's in the blacks. Maseltow!
She might have left debts

952
01:27:05,933 --> 01:27:08,811
How big black numbers?

953
01:27:09,853 --> 01:27:11,650
Well...

954
01:27:21,533 --> 01:27:26,163
Have you expected anything else but
a worthless bonds package?

955
01:27:26,163 --> 01:27:29,245
Be honest, I did.

956
01:27:29,245 --> 01:27:33,167
I believed in it,
I had no chance

957
01:27:33,167 --> 01:27:36,848
but I took it.
My family as well.

958
01:27:37,293 --> 01:27:41,252
Some travel a lot between
Frankfurt and Berlin.

959
01:27:41,252 --> 01:27:45,212
Why not?
Makes the airlines happy.

960
01:27:46,013 --> 01:27:48,607
Well, and me?

961
01:27:49,773 --> 01:27:55,166
Don't have much time for playing.
I take care of my family.

962
01:27:55,166 --> 01:27:59,246
Monday for Jana,
tuesday Thomas, Friday Marlene,

963
01:27:59,533 --> 01:28:03,685
and on sunday I call to Samuel
for 2 hours.

964
01:28:03,685 --> 01:28:07,925
Wednesday and Thursday I go to
Synagoge and read the bible.

965
01:28:07,925 --> 01:28:10,607
Nonsense, the Thora.

966
01:28:13,613 --> 01:28:16,207
No offence ment!

967
01:28:16,207 --> 01:28:18,364


968
01:28:24,693 --> 01:28:25,693
