1
00:01:26,584 --> 00:01:28,709
My father wanted to
teach me from childhood.

2
00:01:28,917 --> 00:01:31,417
Than the one who is
afraid of something.

3
00:01:31,626 --> 00:01:35,334
Gives this fear immense
power over his life.

4
00:01:38,626 --> 00:01:40,542
Come on, jump.

5
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:43,292
"He told me that
fear is an animal."

6
00:01:43,501 --> 00:01:46,417
And that an animal can
be tamed or killed.

7
00:02:02,917 --> 00:02:06,084
I did not always understand
what my father meant.

8
00:02:07,876 --> 00:02:12,417
But that day, I realized
he wanted me to be a man.

9
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:08,917
Thanks, Sam. It was great.

10
00:04:09,126 --> 00:04:10,876
- See you next year.
- Yeah.

11
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,751
"Are you coming, children?"

12
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,334
- Good-bye, captain.
- Hello!

13
00:04:14,542 --> 00:04:16,667
- Hi, Sam.
- Hi, guy.

14
00:04:16,876 --> 00:04:18,042
Good-bye, captain.

15
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,292
Bye madam.

16
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:24,251
I'm not disturbing you?

17
00:04:24,459 --> 00:04:25,917
Samantha! I did not see you.

18
00:04:26,126 --> 00:04:27,959
You told me four o'clock. It is 6:30 pm.

19
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:30,917
- Yes. You are going to laugh...
- No! I do not have the time.

20
00:04:31,126 --> 00:04:34,292
Just a phone call
to warn, Samuel.

21
00:04:34,501 --> 00:04:36,501
"Samuel"?
Looks like a kid you're hooking.

22
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:37,709
You're a kid.

23
00:04:37,876 --> 00:04:39,917
I say nothing when you
pretend to be the boss,

24
00:04:40,126 --> 00:04:43,251
when you bring your
daughters back on the boat,

25
00:04:43,459 --> 00:04:45,917
but 150 Euros more
gasoline, it gets drunk.

26
00:04:48,584 --> 00:04:49,584
And that?

27
00:04:49,667 --> 00:04:51,667
Is that my tip? No.

28
00:04:51,876 --> 00:04:54,751
It's for the full.
I prolonged because they burst.

29
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:56,834
Result:
15 days booked next year.

30
00:04:57,042 --> 00:04:58,042
Then limit.

31
00:04:58,084 --> 00:05:01,376
A little thank you or a
kiss and we are quits.

32
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:04,209
- I hate you.
- Me too I love you.

33
00:05:04,417 --> 00:05:05,876
This evening, no overtaking.

34
00:05:06,084 --> 00:05:07,501
I cut at 4 o'clock. 1 h.

35
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:08,834
- 3h?
- 1 h.

36
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:10,084
- 2h?
- You're fired.

37
00:05:10,292 --> 00:05:12,709
Ok. 1h, that's fine.

38
00:05:15,001 --> 00:05:16,126
1h15, 1h30, what.

39
00:05:16,334 --> 00:05:19,042
- 1 h!
- Here.

40
00:05:37,709 --> 00:05:38,709
Hi, Sam!

41
00:05:38,751 --> 00:05:40,542
It's okay? It goes well?

42
00:05:40,751 --> 00:05:42,626
- Thank you.
- It's cool. Great.

43
00:05:49,876 --> 00:05:53,167
The day I drive the
yacht that is there.

44
00:05:53,376 --> 00:05:55,667
So you can call me "captain".

45
00:05:55,876 --> 00:05:57,084
- Right?
- Yeah.

46
00:05:57,292 --> 00:05:58,542
Or "skipper".

47
00:05:58,751 --> 00:06:00,626
You can also...

48
00:06:00,834 --> 00:06:03,126
But "captain", it works.
Are you okay, captain?

49
00:06:03,334 --> 00:06:05,084
What's wrong?

50
00:06:05,292 --> 00:06:07,501
Have you seen the time?
Samantha stop calling me.

51
00:06:07,709 --> 00:06:10,542
Tomorrow we have the biggest
customer of the season.

52
00:06:10,751 --> 00:06:12,334
- It's okay, relax.
- I am relaxing?

53
00:06:12,542 --> 00:06:14,084
We're not having a good night?

54
00:06:14,292 --> 00:06:15,876
- I'm having fun.
- That's it. Kiffe.

55
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,284
Do not worry about tomorrow.
Everything will be alright.

56
00:06:18,308 --> 00:06:19,542
Sit down or dance.

57
00:06:19,751 --> 00:06:20,917
She's not harassing you?

58
00:06:21,126 --> 00:06:23,751
Because it makes me a hell.

59
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:25,751
- Yes, she called.
- I am fired.

60
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:26,959
I'll handle it.

61
00:06:27,167 --> 00:06:29,126
Are you gonna manage?
I am waiting to see.

62
00:06:29,334 --> 00:06:31,917
Yes look. Look well.

63
00:06:38,292 --> 00:06:40,959
Do you want the
party to continue?

64
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:42,501
Yeah!

65
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:45,501
I'll ask you to make
a little game for me:

66
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:47,209
A silence of one minute.

67
00:06:50,292 --> 00:06:52,209
It starts now. Hush.

68
00:06:52,417 --> 00:06:53,417
Hello? Samantha?

69
00:06:53,584 --> 00:06:56,834
5 h of the mat. What are you doing?

70
00:06:57,042 --> 00:07:00,709
Well, I'm sleeping. Is there a worry?
"All the neighborhood calls me."

71
00:07:00,917 --> 00:07:02,626
There would be music.

72
00:07:02,834 --> 00:07:05,834
What? Music? Well no.

73
00:07:06,042 --> 00:07:08,084
I would have heard it.
I can not hear him.

74
00:07:08,292 --> 00:07:10,917
I'm connected. Neighbors invent!

75
00:07:11,126 --> 00:07:15,084
Yeah. They are a bit mythos.
I'm on the boat.

76
00:07:15,292 --> 00:07:17,292
I have the beach in front
of me and it is deserted.

77
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:18,917
There is not a cat around.

78
00:07:19,126 --> 00:07:20,251
Stop playing.

79
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:22,667
It was cute when you were
little, but no longer there.

80
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:26,001
Oh yes, you're right.
At the time for me.

81
00:07:26,209 --> 00:07:28,584
I see a guy with a hat.

82
00:07:28,792 --> 00:07:29,834
They're in band.

83
00:07:30,042 --> 00:07:31,042
They are going to move,

84
00:07:31,167 --> 00:07:33,376
make a campfire...
I'll fire them.

85
00:07:34,292 --> 00:07:35,459
- chut!
- Hush!

86
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:36,907
I do not want any more noise.

87
00:07:37,042 --> 00:07:38,792
Okay, I'm telling them.
Count on me.

88
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:40,542
Okay. So much the better.

89
00:07:43,667 --> 00:07:45,209
Good. Where were we already?

90
00:08:23,542 --> 00:08:24,917
Sam, are you there?

91
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:28,042
Sat?

92
00:08:30,501 --> 00:08:32,251
"Samuel?"

93
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:46,126
Good morning.

94
00:08:46,334 --> 00:08:49,126
It is impossible to
go out to sea today.

95
00:08:49,334 --> 00:08:51,584
It looks very quiet like that.

96
00:08:51,792 --> 00:08:54,126
But it's dangerous.
You do not recognize me?

97
00:08:56,626 --> 00:08:57,709
Kristin.

98
00:08:59,209 --> 00:09:03,167
Last summer, the boat,
the calanques...

99
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:06,334
"Ah, but yes!
Kristin... Kristin from Berlin."

100
00:09:06,542 --> 00:09:08,959
- From London.
- That's it.

101
00:09:09,167 --> 00:09:11,042
- It's cool to see you!
- Yes.

102
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:15,126
With your baby. Hey? Your baby.

103
00:09:15,334 --> 00:09:16,459
And actually...

104
00:09:16,667 --> 00:09:19,417
Sorry, you can not
get on the boat.

105
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:21,417
I tidy.
I'll introduce Gloria to you.

106
00:09:24,251 --> 00:09:26,376
Good morning, Gloria.

107
00:09:26,584 --> 00:09:27,584
It gurgles in English.

108
00:09:27,751 --> 00:09:28,751
Hey, Gloria.

109
00:09:28,917 --> 00:09:31,167
She's hurting, huh? Bravo.

110
00:09:31,376 --> 00:09:32,417
It's your daughter.

111
00:09:32,626 --> 00:09:33,792
Hmm?

112
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:36,834
Your daughter.

113
00:09:37,417 --> 00:09:38,751
Your daughter, Samuel.

114
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,334
Here. Your daughter.

115
00:09:40,542 --> 00:09:43,084
In French, when you mean.

116
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:44,792
You say "ma", you see.

117
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:48,292
I know it must be a
shock to you, but...

118
00:09:49,209 --> 00:09:50,417
It's your baby.

119
00:09:51,334 --> 00:09:53,626
No. "Your baby of me," no.

120
00:09:53,834 --> 00:09:56,167
It has nothing to do.
It's not me.

121
00:09:56,376 --> 00:09:57,126
It has <i>3</i> months.

122
00:09:57,334 --> 00:10:00,334
Yeah, <i>3</i> months, but what?

123
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:03,042
What are you doing to me?

124
00:10:03,626 --> 00:10:05,417
I know, it's crazy, but...

125
00:10:05,626 --> 00:10:07,709
- I came to...
- It's not crazy.

126
00:10:07,917 --> 00:10:10,584
But no, it's not crazy!
It's not crazy at all.

127
00:10:10,792 --> 00:10:11,792
It's not crazy.

128
00:10:11,917 --> 00:10:14,917
Because in fact, no.
It's unfortunate, but not.

129
00:10:15,126 --> 00:10:17,959
I am sorry.
Because if you think...

130
00:10:19,626 --> 00:10:21,376
Well no. You see?

131
00:10:21,584 --> 00:10:23,001
So sorry, but no.

132
00:10:23,209 --> 00:10:24,459
Ok, kiss.

133
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:26,042
You got 20 Euros for the taxi?

134
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:30,209
Please.
Um yes. This, yes! This, yes!

135
00:10:30,417 --> 00:10:31,834
I'll get that for you.

136
00:10:32,042 --> 00:10:33,959
But <i>3</i> months, no.

137
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:42,709
Here. 20 Euros and kisses, bye.

138
00:10:42,917 --> 00:10:44,126
Here!

139
00:10:44,626 --> 00:10:45,917
Here.

140
00:10:48,334 --> 00:10:49,584
Thank you very much.

141
00:10:49,792 --> 00:10:51,042
Can you keep it for me?

142
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:53,542
Uh... yeah, but...

143
00:10:53,751 --> 00:10:56,542
So wait. You do... hurry up!

144
00:10:58,501 --> 00:11:00,001
It's heavy, though.

145
00:11:02,209 --> 00:11:04,251
Do not worry, she's coming back.

146
00:11:05,126 --> 00:11:06,584
Look.

147
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:10,042
She pays and she comes back.
Look, do not worry.

148
00:11:10,709 --> 00:11:13,334
It does not help. She comes.

149
00:11:13,876 --> 00:11:16,626
But do not worry!
Yes but no. Look.

150
00:11:18,167 --> 00:11:19,167
Here.

151
00:11:19,209 --> 00:11:20,459
She's going to pay.

152
00:11:20,667 --> 00:11:22,417
She's paying. Look.

153
00:11:22,626 --> 00:11:25,667
What the hell is she doing?
Is she busy?

154
00:11:26,626 --> 00:11:28,001
She's standing there, right?

155
00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:29,917
Kristin!

156
00:11:30,542 --> 00:11:32,959
You've forgotten your stuff!

157
00:11:33,167 --> 00:11:34,709
Kristin, the bags!

158
00:11:36,876 --> 00:11:39,084
Not without the bags!

159
00:11:39,751 --> 00:11:41,126
Stop, stop, stop!

160
00:11:42,542 --> 00:11:44,084
Sleep with ladies.

161
00:11:46,376 --> 00:11:48,834
- What's this?
- Nothing. An abandoned baby.

162
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,792
- Hey? It's disgusting.
- Exactly!

163
00:11:52,001 --> 00:11:54,792
Her mother stole 20
bullets and stood up.

164
00:11:55,001 --> 00:11:56,626
- She stole 20 bullets?
- Yes.

165
00:11:56,834 --> 00:11:58,417
You know that girl?

166
00:11:58,626 --> 00:11:59,626
No! What dalle!

167
00:12:00,709 --> 00:12:02,501
We vaguely slept together,

168
00:12:02,709 --> 00:12:04,792
but not enough to say:
"It's your daughter."

169
00:12:05,001 --> 00:12:08,084
It's too easy! I also
take a kid and I give it!

170
00:12:09,042 --> 00:12:10,209
Why is she crying?

171
00:12:10,417 --> 00:12:13,167
"It's obvious, she's upset.
You reject it."

172
00:12:13,376 --> 00:12:15,176
It's not easy,
father-daughter relationship.

173
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:17,084
Me, with my father, it's...

174
00:12:17,292 --> 00:12:18,292
"Stop, with your father!"

175
00:12:19,292 --> 00:12:21,709
She is hungry. That's all.
You do not have milk?

176
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:31,876
Wait, I got something.

177
00:12:34,917 --> 00:12:35,959
Her name is Gloria Stuart.

178
00:12:36,167 --> 00:12:37,834
Here. Stuart, it's not my name.

179
00:12:38,042 --> 00:12:39,959
So it's not my daughter.

180
00:12:40,167 --> 00:12:41,501
You're all confusing.

181
00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:44,876
I have a Kristin Stuart from
London on Facebook, there.

182
00:12:45,084 --> 00:12:47,001
Maybe it's her. Show me.

183
00:12:47,209 --> 00:12:49,167
It's her.
Looks like she's blocked her account.

184
00:12:49,376 --> 00:12:50,834
She has no friends.

185
00:12:51,042 --> 00:12:53,501
Normal!
Did you see what she does to people?

186
00:13:00,084 --> 00:13:01,959
- Well, answer.
- Yes.

187
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:05,292
Hello?

188
00:13:06,334 --> 00:13:07,334
Hello?

189
00:13:07,417 --> 00:13:09,167
"Ah, Samuel?"
Kristin, where are you?

190
00:13:09,376 --> 00:13:12,251
Immediate boarding...
Sorry, I...

191
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:15,709
I can not.
Take the plane. Do not do this to me.

192
00:13:15,917 --> 00:13:17,167
That's not cool.

193
00:13:17,376 --> 00:13:19,292
I know nothing about baby.

194
00:13:19,501 --> 00:13:22,584
You can not trust me.
I'll spoil it.

195
00:13:22,792 --> 00:13:24,001
Hello?

196
00:13:25,042 --> 00:13:27,667
Hello?
"I'm the one who ruins it, Samuel."

197
00:13:29,084 --> 00:13:33,251
It's me.
*-no! She's doing very well, this girl.

198
00:13:33,459 --> 00:13:37,542
I'm not doing well at all.
I'll never be a good mother.

199
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:40,126
I'm sure you're going
to be a great father.

200
00:13:40,334 --> 00:13:42,834
No! I'm not a super father.

201
00:13:43,042 --> 00:13:46,417
I'm a kid.
You do not give a kid to another kid.

202
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:49,001
Hello, Kristin? Kristin?

203
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,501
She hung up.

204
00:13:56,709 --> 00:13:58,251
She's going to fly.

205
00:13:58,459 --> 00:14:00,292
It's far, the airport?

206
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:06,417
Hey! It's okay, is not it?

207
00:14:06,626 --> 00:14:08,001
Gloria screams.

208
00:14:14,751 --> 00:14:15,751
Cuckoo, Sam.

209
00:14:15,876 --> 00:14:17,116
It's the brothel on the boat.

210
00:14:17,209 --> 00:14:20,584
Yes I saw that.
I do not know what happened.

211
00:14:20,792 --> 00:14:23,542
Two naked chicks
drink champagne!

212
00:14:23,751 --> 00:14:26,292
I'm here in 15 seconds.
* -no, not in 15 sec.

213
00:14:26,501 --> 00:14:28,376
There are bottles everywhere,

214
00:14:28,584 --> 00:14:30,417
hoods and diapers!

215
00:14:30,626 --> 00:14:32,459
No, but are you serious?

216
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:35,709
I'll explain, but I'm taking
care of something before.

217
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:37,376
I kiss you. Kisses.

218
00:14:38,542 --> 00:14:39,667
"Bisous"...

219
00:14:43,709 --> 00:14:47,834
immediate embarkation
for London...

220
00:14:48,042 --> 00:14:49,251
Whore!

221
00:14:50,084 --> 00:14:51,251
Sorry!

222
00:14:51,459 --> 00:14:54,126
I will give up a child.
It's not mine...

223
00:14:54,334 --> 00:14:58,001
Kristin!
Boarding pass and passport.

224
00:14:58,209 --> 00:15:01,089
- My girlfriend has forgotten her daughter.
- Boarding pass and passport.

225
00:15:01,113 --> 00:15:03,959
It's not me who's leaving.
It's her. With her!

226
00:15:04,167 --> 00:15:05,167
Kristin, the little one!

227
00:15:05,376 --> 00:15:07,751
Sir, bring him back.
That's the girl out there.

228
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:10,459
Give him back directly.
She's over there.

229
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:13,709
- Boarding pass and passport.
- You know a sentence!

230
00:15:13,917 --> 00:15:16,667
- Yeah, well, please!
- Do not touch me.

231
00:15:16,876 --> 00:15:18,542
Boarding pass and passport.

232
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:21,667
Samuel? What are you doing here?

233
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:32,959
Samantha, I'm a little late, but
I'll be there this afternoon.

234
00:15:33,126 --> 00:15:34,834
I'll be back at 3pm?

235
00:15:35,042 --> 00:15:39,459
Yes, you will be in London at 11am.
To go to the pub, it is direct in tube.

236
00:15:39,667 --> 00:15:43,334
Why are you laughing?
It seems like you said "cock".

237
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:46,376
Not at all. I said tube.
The Metro.

238
00:15:46,584 --> 00:15:47,584
Put the cream.

239
00:15:47,667 --> 00:15:49,542
No, there's paraben!

240
00:15:49,751 --> 00:15:51,792
- That's good, guys!
- Must do that well.

241
00:15:52,001 --> 00:15:52,709
Look.

242
00:15:52,917 --> 00:15:56,459
The fasteners behind and
tuck you on the stomach.

243
00:15:56,667 --> 00:15:58,667
Squeeze too much,
she can breathe more.

244
00:15:58,876 --> 00:16:00,792
If you do not press it, it's gonna run.

245
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,459
No, it's baby-dry.

246
00:16:02,667 --> 00:16:04,709
Its good.
Thank you, stéphane, Philippe.

247
00:16:04,917 --> 00:16:05,917
It's the opposite.

248
00:16:07,292 --> 00:16:08,959
What if she's crying on the plane?

249
00:16:09,167 --> 00:16:10,167
Impossible.

250
00:16:10,251 --> 00:16:11,626
She ate and she is clean.

251
00:16:11,834 --> 00:16:14,584
She's going to sleep all the way.
It's certain.

252
00:16:15,667 --> 00:16:16,667
Gloria screams.

253
00:16:16,792 --> 00:16:19,959
The hostess speaks in English.
Welcome to London.

254
00:16:20,167 --> 00:16:23,876
We hope you enjoyed
the flight...

255
00:16:24,084 --> 00:16:26,251
The worst flight of my life.

256
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:28,542
It's okay.
Have you ever wept for your life?

257
00:16:28,751 --> 00:16:30,501
She does not like the plane.

258
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:33,251
What line?

259
00:16:34,709 --> 00:16:36,501
Here! Piccadilly.

260
00:16:36,709 --> 00:16:39,626
Good game.
Not bad, for a girl of your age.

261
00:16:39,834 --> 00:16:40,834
Sam baragouin in English.

262
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:42,292
Sir?

263
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:45,626
Can you tell me the "teub"?

264
00:16:45,834 --> 00:16:46,834
"Teub"?

265
00:16:46,917 --> 00:16:48,001
"Teub".

266
00:16:48,209 --> 00:16:49,209
The tube!

267
00:16:49,251 --> 00:16:57,251
The man arle an lais at full speed...

268
00:17:00,334 --> 00:17:02,376
I did not understand anything. Sorry.

269
00:17:02,584 --> 00:17:04,001
You speak too fast.

270
00:17:04,209 --> 00:17:05,251
Fuck!

271
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:07,459
That's what I understood. It was slower.

272
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:09,584
Good. He just insulted us.

273
00:17:09,792 --> 00:17:11,376
We must find the "teub".

274
00:17:13,126 --> 00:17:15,209
Next station...

275
00:17:15,417 --> 00:17:17,209
But no, we're fine, there.

276
00:17:17,417 --> 00:17:19,876
Ah shit...

277
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:22,084
It stinks.

278
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:24,042
Well yeah.

279
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:26,459
Well yeah...

280
00:17:36,792 --> 00:17:38,542
Oh yeah, okay.

281
00:17:40,584 --> 00:17:42,042
A man yells in English.

282
00:17:42,251 --> 00:17:44,917
Find me a guy who
looks like our guy!

283
00:17:45,126 --> 00:17:47,459
Do your job, damn!

284
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:48,417
Or I turn you!

285
00:17:48,626 --> 00:17:49,959
They're shit, shit!

286
00:17:50,167 --> 00:17:52,084
- You speak French?
- It happens to me.

287
00:17:52,292 --> 00:17:54,876
- You're going to save my life.
- With pleasure.

288
00:17:55,084 --> 00:17:56,876
- Me, it's Bernie.
- I'm Samuel.

289
00:17:57,084 --> 00:17:58,167
That's sublime.

290
00:17:58,376 --> 00:17:59,751
That's fine, yeah.

291
00:17:59,959 --> 00:18:01,876
You will help me. I'm lost.

292
00:18:02,084 --> 00:18:04,792
- Stay to the left.
Wrote: "Hold your right."

293
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:08,834
The English laugh not even
with the seductive tourists.

294
00:18:09,042 --> 00:18:10,959
I'm not a tourist.

295
00:18:11,167 --> 00:18:13,834
Is not that close?
It is not false.

296
00:18:14,042 --> 00:18:16,334
That's good. Been to londres?

297
00:18:16,542 --> 00:18:18,792
15 years I live here.
What are you looking for?

298
00:18:19,001 --> 00:18:21,584
I have to give a baby back to his mother.

299
00:18:21,792 --> 00:18:23,501
- What baby?
- The baby that's there.

300
00:18:23,709 --> 00:18:24,376
Whore!

301
00:18:24,584 --> 00:18:26,959
Hold your right!

302
00:18:33,292 --> 00:18:34,292
No no no!

303
00:18:34,334 --> 00:18:35,626
Hold your right!

304
00:18:36,292 --> 00:18:37,792
Hold your right!

305
00:18:39,334 --> 00:18:40,459
Damn, damn it!

306
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,876
Hold your right!

307
00:18:51,334 --> 00:18:53,584
I'm here, I'm here!

308
00:18:53,792 --> 00:18:57,251
She's good! Yeah!

309
00:18:58,584 --> 00:18:59,584
Bravo!

310
00:18:59,667 --> 00:19:01,626
Yeah, she's good.

311
00:19:04,917 --> 00:19:07,251
Hello, Michael. I found it.

312
00:19:07,459 --> 00:19:09,292
- Wait!
- I do not have the time.

313
00:19:09,501 --> 00:19:12,751
It's a golden opportunity.
Stuntman, it is a sublime craft.

314
00:19:12,959 --> 00:19:15,839
There's lots of money to be made.
I'm looking for his mother, not work.

315
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:18,209
And I go home.
"Where is her mother?"

316
00:19:18,417 --> 00:19:21,584
She works at old queen's head.
It would be in the corner.

317
00:19:21,792 --> 00:19:23,334
It's right there.

318
00:19:23,542 --> 00:19:25,917
- That's it!
- No, but wait!

319
00:19:26,126 --> 00:19:28,417
If you change your mind,

320
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:32,126
there, there are my pro
and behind coordinates...

321
00:19:32,334 --> 00:19:34,459
It's personal. We never know.

322
00:19:34,667 --> 00:19:38,626
Domino effect that makes
snowball and needle thread...

323
00:19:38,834 --> 00:19:43,167
The bird makes its nest.
"What nest?" There is no nest.

324
00:19:43,751 --> 00:19:47,542
Well, I... Well, here we are.

325
00:19:48,167 --> 00:19:51,792
Good. Nice to meet you.
Stay cool.

326
00:19:53,042 --> 00:19:54,959
We're not bored with you.

327
00:19:55,167 --> 00:19:57,667
What's the matter?

328
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:03,834
No, do not start.
You'll be fine with your mother.

329
00:20:04,042 --> 00:20:06,626
A dad like me on a
daily basis is tiring.

330
00:20:06,834 --> 00:20:08,042
Do not look at me like that.

331
00:20:08,251 --> 00:20:10,084
It's hot. It will not work.

332
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:13,042
Trust me, nothing
replaces a mom.

333
00:20:13,251 --> 00:20:15,042
It's a canon, a mom.

334
00:20:24,042 --> 00:20:25,417
A Coca light.

335
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:26,792
Sorry?

336
00:20:26,834 --> 00:20:28,876
Coke light.

337
00:20:30,376 --> 00:20:32,459
The sugar-free, light.
Do you understand "light"?

338
00:20:32,667 --> 00:20:34,542
No, she does not speak English.

339
00:20:35,459 --> 00:20:37,001
It wants a <i>diet coke.</i>

340
00:20:37,209 --> 00:20:38,209
It's not the same here.

341
00:20:38,334 --> 00:20:39,959
You all speak French?

342
00:20:40,167 --> 00:20:44,084
A bar is not a surprise.
London would be the 6th French city.

343
00:20:44,292 --> 00:20:47,501
There would be more French here
than in Bordeaux. It's crazy!

344
00:20:47,709 --> 00:20:48,709
It's crazy.

345
00:20:48,917 --> 00:20:51,167
Look.

346
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:54,292
So we would be more
of bayonne, dijon...

347
00:20:54,501 --> 00:20:55,542
It's less crazy.

348
00:20:55,751 --> 00:20:58,834
And otherwise, you may
be able to help me.

349
00:20:59,042 --> 00:21:01,042
I'm looking for that waitress, Kristin.

350
00:21:01,251 --> 00:21:04,042
- No, never seen.
- You can not tell me that.

351
00:21:04,251 --> 00:21:06,959
She works there.
This is the queen machin.

352
00:21:07,167 --> 00:21:08,834
It's your colleague.
I never saw her.

353
00:21:09,042 --> 00:21:11,417
It's a new owner.
She changed her pub.

354
00:21:11,626 --> 00:21:14,584
You know the number of waitresses who...
Leave it.

355
00:21:14,792 --> 00:21:16,584
How much do I owe you?
Two pounds.

356
00:21:16,792 --> 00:21:18,042
Fuck, it's pounds here!

357
00:21:18,251 --> 00:21:19,834
- Yes.
- I have Euros.

358
00:21:20,042 --> 00:21:21,792
We can settle it.

359
00:21:22,001 --> 00:21:24,792
Oh damn, it's not possible!

360
00:21:25,001 --> 00:21:28,292
Sorry! Excuse me! I lost...

361
00:21:28,501 --> 00:21:31,001
Ah well, it is... He's there.

362
00:21:40,167 --> 00:21:42,459
Whore! No!

363
00:21:49,417 --> 00:21:51,876
What the hell are I doing here?

364
00:21:57,709 --> 00:21:58,709
Oh no!

365
00:21:58,792 --> 00:22:01,667
Shit!
It was not raining two minutes ago.

366
00:22:06,459 --> 00:22:08,376
I will find a solution.

367
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:16,584
Hello? How are you,
my favorite Samantha?

368
00:22:16,792 --> 00:22:17,876
Where are you?

369
00:22:18,084 --> 00:22:18,792
In London.

370
00:22:19,001 --> 00:22:20,501
- What?
- I explain to you.

371
00:22:20,709 --> 00:22:21,709
Big galley.

372
00:22:21,876 --> 00:22:23,876
I have a baby on my arms,
I do not find his mother.

373
00:22:24,001 --> 00:22:28,084
I lost wallet, passports...
She is hungry. It is raining.

374
00:22:28,292 --> 00:22:30,001
You really have to help me, Sam.

375
00:22:30,209 --> 00:22:32,501
Hold on. Are you in London?

376
00:22:32,709 --> 00:22:35,542
Yes, but it's not that far.
Ben, stay there!

377
00:22:35,751 --> 00:22:38,376
I warned you, okay?
You're fired.

378
00:22:38,584 --> 00:22:40,126
Yes, make me a transfer...

379
00:22:40,334 --> 00:22:42,834
Listen to me. I'm joking more, there.

380
00:22:43,042 --> 00:22:45,084
Ok, it hurts, but you're fired.

381
00:22:45,751 --> 00:22:47,334
Good-bye, Sam.

382
00:23:24,251 --> 00:23:27,501
"Do you know that address?"
"That place?"

383
00:23:27,709 --> 00:23:30,417
- Yes.
- Continue, then right.

384
00:23:30,626 --> 00:23:33,084
Right, like that? Ok. Thank you.

385
00:23:58,084 --> 00:24:01,251
Hush! Come on, do not cry.

386
00:24:01,584 --> 00:24:04,251
It will be fine.
We will find a solution.

387
00:24:07,751 --> 00:24:08,917
Do not be afraid.

388
00:24:10,084 --> 00:24:11,751
We must not be afraid.

389
00:24:12,917 --> 00:24:15,167
Come on. You must sleep, my daughter.

390
00:24:21,834 --> 00:24:23,209
My daughter...

391
00:24:36,834 --> 00:24:37,834
Thank you.

392
00:24:48,334 --> 00:24:49,459
Sir?

393
00:24:52,501 --> 00:24:54,834
You can't be here.

394
00:24:56,667 --> 00:24:58,667
The house is under video surveillance,

395
00:24:58,876 --> 00:25:01,001
and the police will be here in a minute.

396
00:25:01,209 --> 00:25:04,292
So, you better go now. Please sir.

397
00:25:05,292 --> 00:25:06,292
<i>Sir I warning you.</i>

398
00:25:06,417 --> 00:25:10,542
I have a pepper spray, and
I'm not afraid to use it.

399
00:25:10,751 --> 00:25:12,584
Sir. Last warning.

400
00:25:36,209 --> 00:25:37,209
Dad.

401
00:25:41,042 --> 00:25:43,834
You said it! You said it!
She said "dad"!

402
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:48,126
It's daddy. It's me. Redirect it!
Dad.

403
00:25:48,334 --> 00:25:49,501
- Dad.
- Tata.

404
00:25:49,709 --> 00:25:50,709
Tata.

405
00:25:50,917 --> 00:25:52,751
- Dad. Dad!
- That's dad.

406
00:25:53,876 --> 00:25:54,876
Dad.

407
00:25:57,084 --> 00:25:58,084
Come on, come on.

408
00:25:58,251 --> 00:26:00,167
Gloria, come, come!

409
00:26:01,501 --> 00:26:02,501
Come!

410
00:26:10,834 --> 00:26:11,876
Cuckoo, my baby.

411
00:26:13,251 --> 00:26:14,251
It's okay?

412
00:26:21,917 --> 00:26:23,709
It's okay?

413
00:26:23,917 --> 00:26:25,917
Ah, you got a bobo? Hold on.

414
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:27,417
Do not move.

415
00:26:27,626 --> 00:26:29,251
I have an idea.

416
00:26:29,459 --> 00:26:32,292
Hop there!
She works well, this ointment.

417
00:26:34,126 --> 00:26:35,126
Gloria!

418
00:26:37,667 --> 00:26:39,334
What did you do!

419
00:26:40,501 --> 00:26:42,126
We must not do that.
It's not good.

420
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:43,792
How do I clean?

421
00:26:48,001 --> 00:26:49,001
Are you ready?

422
00:26:50,667 --> 00:26:51,751
Oh sorry!

423
00:26:53,376 --> 00:26:54,376
No!

424
00:26:56,626 --> 00:26:57,626
Yeah!

425
00:26:58,626 --> 00:27:00,167
Good night.

426
00:27:06,084 --> 00:27:07,376
"Here!"

427
00:27:12,334 --> 00:27:13,334
Hop!

428
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:25,417
Here. We're all right.

429
00:28:25,626 --> 00:28:29,542
Dad? One day you can
take me to the cliff?

430
00:28:29,751 --> 00:28:33,209
Where you jumped when you were my age.
Yes, I'll take you.

431
00:28:33,417 --> 00:28:34,542
When?

432
00:28:34,751 --> 00:28:37,584
When you're able to
dunker all by yourself.

433
00:28:39,542 --> 00:28:42,126
I go. The first down has won.

434
00:28:51,417 --> 00:28:53,057
We can not see each other this weekend?

435
00:28:54,042 --> 00:28:56,376
No, not this weekend.
Gloria has no school.

436
00:28:56,584 --> 00:28:57,876
I'll stay with her.

437
00:28:58,084 --> 00:29:00,001
There's no school on weekends.

438
00:29:00,667 --> 00:29:02,001
Yes that's it.

439
00:29:02,584 --> 00:29:04,376
I'll stay with her, suddenly.

440
00:29:04,584 --> 00:29:07,501
So we never have a moment both?

441
00:29:19,459 --> 00:29:20,917
Cut.

442
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:22,459
It's perfect!

443
00:29:22,667 --> 00:29:25,292
But it's got to be a lot worse.
Add more blood, or something.

444
00:29:25,501 --> 00:29:27,251
We have to do more reality.

445
00:29:29,459 --> 00:29:31,459
Great, we are goning to keep up!

446
00:29:38,834 --> 00:29:39,959
Sam, are you OK?

447
00:29:41,959 --> 00:29:43,626
Is Sam doing well?

448
00:29:45,209 --> 00:29:46,584
Let me go through, please.

449
00:29:47,417 --> 00:29:50,126
Please. He only needs me.

450
00:29:57,542 --> 00:30:00,959
Dad... Awake, you are immortal.

451
00:30:06,334 --> 00:30:07,834
French shit humor!

452
00:30:08,042 --> 00:30:10,251
We laugh.

453
00:30:10,459 --> 00:30:13,584
He jumped from a cliff to 8 years.
This stuff does not scare me.

454
00:30:13,792 --> 00:30:14,584
Get him out.

455
00:30:14,792 --> 00:30:17,501
We done with this dumbs.
Get the real actors!

456
00:30:17,709 --> 00:30:19,126
Bring all the stars!

457
00:30:19,334 --> 00:30:21,709
We take back!

458
00:30:23,126 --> 00:30:24,126
Here.

459
00:30:24,209 --> 00:30:27,292
I do not care who is responsible.
But I do care,

460
00:30:27,501 --> 00:30:30,167
it is that this shit
does not happen again!

461
00:30:30,376 --> 00:30:31,626
He's not happy.

462
00:30:31,834 --> 00:30:34,042
You have 10 s to find a solution.

463
00:30:34,251 --> 00:30:35,792
Starting now!

464
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:38,667
You did well yelling.
It was a bit violent.

465
00:30:38,876 --> 00:30:40,501
Nothing to see. It was my tax expert.

466
00:30:40,709 --> 00:30:42,626
No, you were perfect.
The scene was sublime.

467
00:30:42,834 --> 00:30:45,001
The more I touch
death, the more sublime!

468
00:30:45,209 --> 00:30:48,042
Well, it's a bit of interest in the job!

469
00:30:52,792 --> 00:30:54,542
What do they still want?

470
00:30:54,751 --> 00:30:56,626
Get some rest. Big day tomorrow.

471
00:30:56,834 --> 00:30:58,501
What did he say?
He speaks too fast.

472
00:30:58,709 --> 00:31:00,959
- You gotta rest tonight.
- Yes.

473
00:31:01,167 --> 00:31:03,417
You still do not get
a word of English!

474
00:31:03,626 --> 00:31:04,917
I am here for this.

475
00:31:05,126 --> 00:31:07,209
Great day, tom.
See you tomorrow.

476
00:31:07,417 --> 00:31:08,542
Here's yours.

477
00:31:08,751 --> 00:31:10,626
What do we do tomorrow?

478
00:31:10,834 --> 00:31:13,292
We're shooting the scene... uh...

479
00:31:13,501 --> 00:31:16,167
You run under the plane taking off.
6 h of the mat '.

480
00:31:16,376 --> 00:31:19,126
- Why do I do this job?
- You know nothing else.

481
00:31:19,334 --> 00:31:21,751
You take me 6000 pounds a month.
You are lodged by the prod.

482
00:31:21,959 --> 00:31:24,417
You adore me. Gloria...
Its good. It's okay.

483
00:31:24,626 --> 00:31:26,417
Its good?

484
00:31:26,626 --> 00:31:29,167
You're 18 seconds late.

485
00:31:29,959 --> 00:31:31,959
Good. What is the score already?

486
00:31:32,167 --> 00:31:36,292
<i>- 4591160.
- So...</i> Match point!

487
00:31:40,251 --> 00:31:41,501
And hop I.

488
00:31:43,667 --> 00:31:46,501
"Oh, that's wonderful!"
- Past!

489
00:31:46,709 --> 00:31:50,084
Magic Gloria will immediately
switch to magic Samuel.

490
00:31:50,292 --> 00:31:52,126
What a move! What a move!

491
00:31:52,334 --> 00:31:55,126
- And hop!
- What a move!

492
00:31:56,751 --> 00:31:57,959
I go.

493
00:32:00,751 --> 00:32:01,876
Hop!

494
00:32:04,376 --> 00:32:05,459
Bernie!

495
00:32:08,042 --> 00:32:09,251
My heart!

496
00:32:10,251 --> 00:32:12,292
Oh, you missed me so much.

497
00:32:12,501 --> 00:32:13,542
We left two hours ago.

498
00:32:13,751 --> 00:32:15,126
It's way too much.

499
00:32:15,334 --> 00:32:17,251
Would you like a slice with us?

500
00:32:17,459 --> 00:32:19,084
Drink? Spent a night?

501
00:32:19,292 --> 00:32:20,292
No thanks.

502
00:32:20,459 --> 00:32:21,542
I have to work.

503
00:32:21,751 --> 00:32:24,209
- He's not an naughty boy.
- Leave him alone, Bernie.

504
00:32:24,417 --> 00:32:25,417
He's not gay.

505
00:32:25,959 --> 00:32:29,167
I think he's curious.
I feel it in my eyes.

506
00:32:29,376 --> 00:32:31,751
There is a possible slip.
I've got the knack for it.

507
00:32:32,376 --> 00:32:33,834
Thank you. See you tomorrow.

508
00:32:34,667 --> 00:32:35,667
Bernie.

509
00:32:35,792 --> 00:32:36,992
Stop darting the delivery men.

510
00:32:37,167 --> 00:32:38,376
Tomorrow, love.

511
00:32:38,584 --> 00:32:40,459
Come on, we go up. It goes into <i>5</i> min!

512
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:44,042
What is this scarf
with cat paws?

513
00:32:44,251 --> 00:32:48,376
It's a silk stole.
A little camouflage tone on tone sublime.

514
00:32:48,584 --> 00:32:50,376
Okay. Yeah.

515
00:32:52,709 --> 00:32:53,709
Jack bates!

516
00:32:56,792 --> 00:32:58,251
He lost his past.

517
00:33:01,959 --> 00:33:03,376
He never had a present.

518
00:33:05,751 --> 00:33:08,084
He is fighting for the future.

519
00:33:12,417 --> 00:33:14,167
Bates is back. Season 8.

520
00:33:14,376 --> 00:33:16,376
Exclusively on channel 4.

521
00:33:17,292 --> 00:33:18,292
Yes, I am!

522
00:33:20,376 --> 00:33:22,417
You are too strong, dad.

523
00:33:22,626 --> 00:33:23,626
Oh, that tweete!

524
00:33:23,667 --> 00:33:25,626
That's it.

525
00:33:25,834 --> 00:33:29,084
- Double sprain for this teaser.
- For millions of viewers.

526
00:33:29,292 --> 00:33:31,834
And the signing of a season 9.
Put on the ointment.

527
00:33:32,042 --> 00:33:34,442
You're right. I'm looking
forward to burning for season 10.

528
00:33:34,584 --> 00:33:36,167
No, that's the end of the 8th.

529
00:33:36,376 --> 00:33:38,584
For the 10, it would require
a more powerful stuff.

530
00:33:38,792 --> 00:33:40,432
"He could jump from a
burning helicopter."

531
00:33:41,334 --> 00:33:43,167
And land in an acid bath!

532
00:33:43,376 --> 00:33:44,542
Well yeah.

533
00:33:44,751 --> 00:33:46,334
Yeah, great!

534
00:33:46,542 --> 00:33:47,542
It'll slam!

535
00:33:48,876 --> 00:33:50,251
I'll slam!

536
00:33:50,459 --> 00:33:52,209
"That would be sublime!"

537
00:33:53,084 --> 00:33:54,084
Mermaid.

538
00:33:55,251 --> 00:33:57,584
It's a mamma's mail. Dad!

539
00:33:57,792 --> 00:33:59,417
Mom sent me an email!

540
00:33:59,626 --> 00:34:01,126
Yes yes yes!

541
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:15,042
"After Russia, here
I am now in China."

542
00:34:15,251 --> 00:34:19,542
"I do not have time to enjoy it, because
I have to infiltrate the Chinese mafia."

543
00:34:19,751 --> 00:34:22,251
"To catch this villain
of wong kar-wai."

544
00:34:22,459 --> 00:34:23,459
"As usual,"

545
00:34:23,667 --> 00:34:27,251
"I miss you honey.
The only thing that comforts me,"

546
00:34:27,459 --> 00:34:30,459
"is to know that you are with the
most loving, intelligent dad,."

547
00:34:30,667 --> 00:34:34,001
"Courageous, and above all, the
most seductive in the world."

548
00:34:34,209 --> 00:34:36,126
"You can be proud of your dad,."

549
00:34:36,334 --> 00:34:39,417
"Because he is the
best man in the world."

550
00:34:39,626 --> 00:34:41,292
"I love you mom."

551
00:34:44,042 --> 00:34:46,417
"What is she doing this time?"

552
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,667
She's infiltrated
in the Chinese mafia.

553
00:34:48,876 --> 00:34:50,876
Ah cool!
And it's fine, over there?

554
00:34:51,084 --> 00:34:53,251
- Yeah, super nice.
- She is lucky.

555
00:34:53,459 --> 00:34:55,376
We're rotting right now.

556
00:34:55,584 --> 00:34:56,917
Hum...

557
00:34:58,042 --> 00:34:59,584
And she has a long time?

558
00:34:59,792 --> 00:35:02,917
Time to wedge wong kar-wai.
It's the bad guy.

559
00:35:03,126 --> 00:35:05,667
Ah, wong kar-wai! Yeah.

560
00:35:05,876 --> 00:35:07,376
It will last for a while.

561
00:35:07,584 --> 00:35:09,167
Yeah, I know.

562
00:35:09,376 --> 00:35:12,834
- Wish him good courage.
- Yeah yeah.

563
00:35:13,042 --> 00:35:16,417
Because wong
kar-wai, we need it.

564
00:35:18,709 --> 00:35:20,876
"I'd love to see you so much, mom.
Promised,."

565
00:35:21,084 --> 00:35:22,626
"If you are on a secret mission,"

566
00:35:22,834 --> 00:35:25,209
"I'll do as if I did not know
you to put you in danger."

567
00:35:25,417 --> 00:35:27,959
"Maybe one day you'll
end up coming to London."

568
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:31,084
"For one of your missions.
I love you. Gloria."

569
00:35:44,792 --> 00:35:47,709
Soon, mama will have made all
the countries of the world.

570
00:35:47,917 --> 00:35:50,751
Oh, right?
No, there must be a few.

571
00:35:50,959 --> 00:35:52,834
- Four.
- Did you count?

572
00:35:53,042 --> 00:35:55,084
Yeah. When it has finished,

573
00:35:55,292 --> 00:35:57,001
she will return to London.

574
00:35:57,209 --> 00:36:00,459
No, it does not mean anything.
It depends on his mission.

575
00:36:00,667 --> 00:36:03,334
She has already made ltaly twice.
Three.

576
00:36:03,542 --> 00:36:07,334
<i>3</i> times ltaly, 4 times Germany, <i>5</i>
times Japan and 6 times Thailand.

577
00:36:07,542 --> 00:36:11,126
Ok. Well yeah.
So she'll end up going through here.

578
00:36:11,334 --> 00:36:15,292
"Or she has already come,
but she can not tell us."

579
00:36:15,501 --> 00:36:18,959
Oh, there's that too.
It's not con.

580
00:36:52,834 --> 00:36:55,501
It is still the class,
a secret mamma.

581
00:36:57,042 --> 00:36:59,001
Sometimes I think you're lucky.

582
00:36:59,667 --> 00:37:02,084
It could have
happened on anyone.

583
00:37:02,292 --> 00:37:04,084
You could have a normal mother.

584
00:37:05,667 --> 00:37:07,167
It's cool. No?

585
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:10,334
This is so cool.

586
00:37:11,084 --> 00:37:15,167
"Can you give me a recap of all
the countries of your mother?"

587
00:37:15,376 --> 00:37:17,751
Because sometimes I forget.

588
00:37:17,959 --> 00:37:20,126
History to make me a recap, what.

589
00:37:20,334 --> 00:37:21,959
Hey, glo?

590
00:38:29,959 --> 00:38:31,584
What are you doing?

591
00:38:31,792 --> 00:38:34,251
Excuse me.
I send an email. I arrive.

592
00:38:35,709 --> 00:38:37,542
Have not you let the matter go?

593
00:38:39,001 --> 00:38:41,167
You know that one day she will understand?

594
00:38:41,376 --> 00:38:43,042
Do not start, please.

595
00:38:43,251 --> 00:38:45,084
Ok. Well, I'm going.

596
00:38:45,876 --> 00:38:47,042
Ok. See you tomorrow.

597
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:49,834
That's it, tomorrow.

598
00:39:24,209 --> 00:39:27,792
"Can you get out of school earlier?"
At 3:30 pm, there is a 3D session.

599
00:39:28,001 --> 00:39:30,709
No, no, you're meeting
with my manager.

600
00:39:30,917 --> 00:39:33,126
- This evening, the director?
- Yeah.

601
00:39:33,334 --> 00:39:35,501
A hard time! Well tomorrow, then.

602
00:39:36,042 --> 00:39:38,251
No more.
You've got to go to the doctor.

603
00:39:38,917 --> 00:39:41,167
What's the bad
news this morning?

604
00:39:41,376 --> 00:39:42,584
Sorry.

605
00:39:42,792 --> 00:39:44,712
You know what?
We're not going to go tomorrow.

606
00:39:44,876 --> 00:39:47,792
I do not like doctors.
They make bites.

607
00:39:48,001 --> 00:39:50,917
They give out disgusting drugs.
We will not go. What?

608
00:39:51,126 --> 00:39:52,292
Are you afraid of bites?

609
00:39:52,501 --> 00:39:53,584
No, I'm not afraid.

610
00:39:53,792 --> 00:39:54,792
- Yes.
- No.

611
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:57,667
Whatever!
Yes, you're scared of bites.

612
00:39:57,876 --> 00:39:59,667
But no. Im shy.

613
00:39:59,876 --> 00:40:01,459
It has nothing to do.

614
00:40:01,667 --> 00:40:03,834
You'll be less afraid
if I come with you?

615
00:40:04,626 --> 00:40:05,959
- Yes.
- Ok.

616
00:40:06,167 --> 00:40:08,542
But you have to
learn to go alone.

617
00:40:08,751 --> 00:40:11,459
When we're more both...
Why do you say that?

618
00:40:11,667 --> 00:40:13,627
When I get a job, I can
not go with you anymore.

619
00:40:13,834 --> 00:40:15,376
You know what you want to do?

620
00:40:15,584 --> 00:40:18,042
Yes. I want to be like you.

621
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:22,292
Come on. Hello.

622
00:40:23,834 --> 00:40:25,334
You want to be stunned?

623
00:40:25,959 --> 00:40:27,876
Immortal.

624
00:40:28,792 --> 00:40:33,126
In a row two by two, the children.

625
00:40:33,334 --> 00:40:36,042
"Let us go back to Gloria's
repeated absences.

626
00:40:36,251 --> 00:40:39,584
"Repeat"? It's strong.
There was a wake-up call yesterday, but...

627
00:40:39,792 --> 00:40:40,992
Last week, she did not come.

628
00:40:41,126 --> 00:40:44,417
- Oh, right? Not even on Monday?
- No.

629
00:40:44,626 --> 00:40:45,834
The week before, either.

630
00:40:46,042 --> 00:40:47,292
"At this moment,"

631
00:40:47,501 --> 00:40:50,376
I shot the explosion scenes
on the tower bridge.

632
00:40:50,584 --> 00:40:54,251
Life is not an entertainment
or an amusement park.

633
00:40:54,459 --> 00:40:56,126
Do you have any idea of the.

634
00:40:56,334 --> 00:40:58,042
Of your education...

635
00:40:58,251 --> 00:41:01,709
Yes, I know the
consequences, but in fact...

636
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:03,584
She was sad.

637
00:41:03,792 --> 00:41:06,917
Because of the disappearance
of sergeant Newman.

638
00:41:07,126 --> 00:41:09,376
And I thought to
cheer him up in...

639
00:41:09,584 --> 00:41:11,376
What happens to sergeant Newman?

640
00:41:11,584 --> 00:41:13,876
Oh, sorry, I spoiled.

641
00:41:14,084 --> 00:41:15,251
"He's not gonna die?"

642
00:41:16,042 --> 00:41:19,001
Secret of production.
I can not say.

643
00:41:19,584 --> 00:41:20,584
Oh no.

644
00:41:21,959 --> 00:41:23,626
Not Newman.

645
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:28,417
Here, I brought you that.

646
00:41:29,209 --> 00:41:31,667
It is... Yes, it's
the real ones.

647
00:41:31,876 --> 00:41:34,751
Worn by the actor.
Oh thank you. How nice.

648
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:36,126
It's a pleasure.

649
00:41:39,126 --> 00:41:40,917
Oh yes, it's great.

650
00:41:44,834 --> 00:41:46,954
I'm telling you this for
the good of the little one.

651
00:41:47,042 --> 00:41:48,334
You are a good father.

652
00:41:48,542 --> 00:41:50,959
You love your daughter.
She is adorable,

653
00:41:51,167 --> 00:41:53,042
when it is there,

654
00:41:53,251 --> 00:41:54,751
but here we are in real life.

655
00:41:54,959 --> 00:41:56,292
Yes.

656
00:41:56,501 --> 00:41:59,834
I do not want to interfere
in your private life, but...

657
00:42:00,042 --> 00:42:01,042
The stories.

658
00:42:01,209 --> 00:42:02,917
She tells about her mother.

659
00:42:03,126 --> 00:42:05,001
Are surprising. As an educator.

660
00:42:05,209 --> 00:42:08,459
Your daughter, I must
know what it really is.

661
00:42:08,667 --> 00:42:10,251
Of his mother. You told me.

662
00:42:10,459 --> 00:42:11,792
That she was to return to London.

663
00:42:13,334 --> 00:42:15,292
You really want
to know the truth?

664
00:42:19,292 --> 00:42:21,751
I lent 20 Euros to his mother
8 years ago for a taxi.

665
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:25,917
And she never came back.

666
00:42:26,417 --> 00:42:27,709
Oh...

667
00:42:29,292 --> 00:42:30,959
Aie aie aie!

668
00:42:31,167 --> 00:42:32,417
There you go.

669
00:42:32,626 --> 00:42:34,251
'It's okay.

670
00:42:34,459 --> 00:42:35,539
We did not feel anything.

671
00:42:35,584 --> 00:42:37,126
Still stings.

672
00:42:37,334 --> 00:42:38,959
Thank you for accompanying me.

673
00:42:39,167 --> 00:42:40,167
Every time.

674
00:42:40,251 --> 00:42:43,001
"I'm counting on you to remind
her to take her medication."

675
00:42:43,209 --> 00:42:44,792
Yes. Morning noon and evening.

676
00:42:45,001 --> 00:42:46,751
As for my vitamins.

677
00:42:46,959 --> 00:42:49,917
"Luckily you're here
to set an example."

678
00:42:51,459 --> 00:42:54,376
Want to come see my baby dog?

679
00:42:54,584 --> 00:42:56,792
- Yes.
- Come!

680
00:43:08,042 --> 00:43:10,251
"I have the test
results, Samuel."

681
00:43:11,751 --> 00:43:13,126
Yes...

682
00:43:14,501 --> 00:43:16,709
The treatment did not work.

683
00:43:21,917 --> 00:43:23,292
How long?

684
00:43:23,834 --> 00:43:25,126
I do not know.

685
00:43:25,709 --> 00:43:27,292
Not a lot.

686
00:43:29,334 --> 00:43:30,584
I am sorry.

687
00:43:31,709 --> 00:43:33,209
We'll have tried everything.

688
00:44:08,792 --> 00:44:10,209
Good bye, sir.

689
00:44:47,001 --> 00:44:48,001
Glo?

690
00:44:48,084 --> 00:44:51,001
You will never guess what
the doctor has prescribed.

691
00:44:51,209 --> 00:44:52,251
What?

692
00:45:07,876 --> 00:45:09,459
Oh dear!

693
00:45:09,667 --> 00:45:12,167
I do not feel very well.
I am dizzy.

694
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:14,209
Hold on. I check the order.

695
00:45:14,417 --> 00:45:18,917
Of course! We forgot the cotton candy.
That's why.

696
00:45:19,709 --> 00:45:20,834
Come on, dear.

697
00:45:21,042 --> 00:45:22,167
Let's go honey, come on.

698
00:45:22,667 --> 00:45:24,126
Sorry.

699
00:45:24,334 --> 00:45:26,001
I thought you were my daughter.

700
00:45:26,209 --> 00:45:28,501
You're so cute. Sorry.

701
00:45:29,292 --> 00:45:30,501
We're going, dear.

702
00:45:31,667 --> 00:45:33,459
Another one, please.

703
00:45:36,042 --> 00:45:37,709
Honey, I was wrong.

704
00:45:37,917 --> 00:45:40,001
I read wrong.
It is 2 cotton candy.

705
00:45:40,209 --> 00:45:43,834
One in the morning, one in the evening.
You want big or big?

706
00:45:44,251 --> 00:45:46,334
I want mom.

707
00:45:49,001 --> 00:45:51,084
You know what?
Drop the prescription.

708
00:45:51,292 --> 00:45:52,917
We'll make a good cheese.

709
00:45:53,126 --> 00:45:54,792
Or a hot dog. Or both.

710
00:45:55,001 --> 00:45:57,542
"I want to see her in real life, dad."

711
00:45:57,751 --> 00:46:00,084
I want to see her in real life.

712
00:46:06,709 --> 00:46:08,542
I know, my dear.

713
00:46:09,542 --> 00:46:10,709
I know.

714
00:46:12,334 --> 00:46:16,584
Gloria, my little
wonder everyday...

715
00:46:16,792 --> 00:46:18,167
Oh, Gloria!

716
00:46:18,376 --> 00:46:19,042
Gloria!

717
00:46:19,251 --> 00:46:23,042
Every day that passes is
an unbearable heartbreak.

718
00:46:24,042 --> 00:46:26,667
Gloria!

719
00:46:26,876 --> 00:46:28,251
"Ah!"

720
00:46:28,459 --> 00:46:29,917
My heart...

721
00:46:31,626 --> 00:46:35,292
I only have a few minutes
before heading back to Bangkok.

722
00:46:36,042 --> 00:46:37,876
But I promise you,

723
00:46:38,084 --> 00:46:40,584
at each mission, you are there.

724
00:46:42,626 --> 00:46:44,126
And above all, you are here.

725
00:46:51,042 --> 00:46:53,417
I love you so much.

726
00:46:53,876 --> 00:46:55,292
My little baby.

727
00:46:56,876 --> 00:46:58,209
Me too, mom.

728
00:46:58,417 --> 00:46:59,417
A lot.

729
00:47:02,251 --> 00:47:04,584
And if not, it's nice in Bangkok?

730
00:47:04,792 --> 00:47:06,334
- The weather is good?
- Oh yes.

731
00:47:06,542 --> 00:47:08,501
Very good. Wonderful!

732
00:47:08,709 --> 00:47:10,251
No, you know.
That is the problem.

733
00:47:10,459 --> 00:47:12,292
- No?
- No, it's not good.

734
00:47:12,501 --> 00:47:13,501
Not at all!

735
00:47:13,626 --> 00:47:16,209
It is raining! It's the monsoon, damn!

736
00:47:16,417 --> 00:47:18,959
She knows everything about her mother.
She holds a notebook.

737
00:47:19,167 --> 00:47:19,917
Notebook...

738
00:47:20,126 --> 00:47:22,001
Must be unstoppable.
Even on the weather.

739
00:47:22,209 --> 00:47:22,876
Shit!

740
00:47:23,084 --> 00:47:24,292
Yeah. Too bad.

741
00:47:24,501 --> 00:47:26,126
I liked it, but it's not worked.

742
00:47:26,334 --> 00:47:27,584
- Yes, it's worked.
- No no no.

743
00:47:27,792 --> 00:47:28,792
- File the wig.
- No!

744
00:47:29,001 --> 00:47:31,334
Please. Give me one more chance.

745
00:47:31,542 --> 00:47:33,584
I do everything perfectly.

746
00:47:33,792 --> 00:47:36,667
Weather, monsoon...
Ok, and then it's over.

747
00:47:36,876 --> 00:47:39,001
I do not have the time.
We have to find it.

748
00:47:39,209 --> 00:47:40,417
What is this bullshit?

749
00:47:41,376 --> 00:47:42,751
Oh, Bernie! You're here.

750
00:47:42,959 --> 00:47:43,959
I was looking for you.

751
00:47:44,042 --> 00:47:46,292
When I got home a while ago...

752
00:47:46,501 --> 00:47:47,501
What is this casting?

753
00:47:52,334 --> 00:47:56,667
- Girls, are you doing here?
- For the role of Kristin.

754
00:47:58,334 --> 00:48:01,126
Gloria's mother.
Thank you. Kiss my ass.

755
00:48:01,334 --> 00:48:02,834
Wait, Bernie!

756
00:48:03,667 --> 00:48:05,459
Bernie!

757
00:48:05,667 --> 00:48:08,667
Listen to me.
Gloria asked me to see her mother.

758
00:48:08,876 --> 00:48:12,417
- Find the real one.
- She does not give a fuck, the real one.

759
00:48:12,626 --> 00:48:14,626
She does not respond to Gloria's mails.

760
00:48:14,834 --> 00:48:17,042
"Say the truth to your daughter, fucking!"

761
00:48:17,251 --> 00:48:21,001
I do not want to make her unhappy.
Can you hear that?

762
00:48:21,209 --> 00:48:25,292
Oh, right? You think you're the
only one worrying about her?

763
00:48:25,501 --> 00:48:29,917
I was there for his first steps,
his first teeth, his first words!

764
00:48:30,126 --> 00:48:33,501
I'm not his father, but I
love him as much as you do.

765
00:48:33,709 --> 00:48:35,417
She will soon be 9 years old.

766
00:48:35,626 --> 00:48:37,626
One day, she'll understand
you're lying to him.

767
00:48:37,834 --> 00:48:40,751
And that's going to
make her unhappy.

768
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:43,292
I know, but it freaks me out.

769
00:48:43,501 --> 00:48:47,167
I'm not telling you it's easy,
just that you have to do it.

770
00:48:47,376 --> 00:48:50,334
So, tonight, you stop
sending fake emails.

771
00:48:50,542 --> 00:48:52,376
And tell the truth to your daughter.

772
00:48:56,376 --> 00:48:57,709
It will be fine.

773
00:49:02,792 --> 00:49:03,876
Ho! Ho!

774
00:49:05,626 --> 00:49:06,959
At table, filibuster.

775
00:49:07,167 --> 00:49:08,501
Here is our Booty.

776
00:49:08,709 --> 00:49:10,292
Grilled crocodile.

777
00:49:10,501 --> 00:49:12,251
And its wild potatoes.

778
00:49:16,084 --> 00:49:17,376
Lend your knife.

779
00:49:17,584 --> 00:49:18,584
I'm sorry, there.

780
00:49:18,792 --> 00:49:19,834
Thank you.

781
00:49:29,209 --> 00:49:33,001
Will we talk afterwards?
I need to talk to you about something.

782
00:49:38,167 --> 00:49:39,376
Do not you touch it?

783
00:49:39,584 --> 00:49:42,001
"Yes, but I'm not very hungry."

784
00:49:46,001 --> 00:49:47,584
What's the matter?

785
00:49:48,667 --> 00:49:50,001
It's mom.

786
00:49:50,834 --> 00:49:53,584
She did not send me an
email this evening.

787
00:49:53,792 --> 00:49:55,667
This is not normal.

788
00:49:58,542 --> 00:49:59,751
You know, honey...

789
00:49:59,959 --> 00:50:01,667
"It's the first time she forgets me."

790
00:50:04,959 --> 00:50:07,417
Can I go to bed? I am tired.

791
00:50:09,667 --> 00:50:10,876
Yes if you want.

792
00:50:17,292 --> 00:50:19,292
We're still going to the circus tomorrow?

793
00:50:20,126 --> 00:50:21,876
Yeah. We'll see.

794
00:50:23,167 --> 00:50:24,876
Good night daddy.

795
00:51:07,709 --> 00:51:08,959
Oh fuck!

796
00:51:12,417 --> 00:51:13,459
She reads.

797
00:51:16,126 --> 00:51:17,292
She reads, fucking.

798
00:51:17,501 --> 00:51:20,667
Gloria! No... hush, shit.

799
00:51:23,185 --> 00:51:24,185
Hold on.

800
00:51:41,292 --> 00:51:42,959
Must answer, meuf!

801
00:52:01,501 --> 00:52:02,834
I am coming tomorrow!

802
00:52:28,626 --> 00:52:30,792
See you tomorrow my love.

803
00:52:39,501 --> 00:52:41,459
Dad, wake up!

804
00:52:41,667 --> 00:52:43,251
Mom will come to see me.

805
00:52:43,459 --> 00:52:45,209
Dad! Mom will come to see me!

806
00:52:45,417 --> 00:52:47,292
Dad!

807
00:52:47,501 --> 00:52:49,667
Mom comes to London! Oh, right?

808
00:52:49,876 --> 00:52:50,876
Yeah.

809
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:52,709
She took wong kar-wai?

810
00:52:52,917 --> 00:52:53,917
I do not care. Look.

811
00:52:54,084 --> 00:52:55,084
She sent me an e-mail.

812
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:56,209
It's awesome!

813
00:52:56,417 --> 00:52:58,209
Yeah! I'll see her
for the first time.

814
00:52:59,417 --> 00:53:00,876
I'm going to get ready.

815
00:53:01,667 --> 00:53:02,667
Get up, papa!

816
00:53:02,792 --> 00:53:04,084
We are going to be late!

817
00:53:07,042 --> 00:53:10,417
That. It...
Very good. All very well.

818
00:53:10,626 --> 00:53:12,917
"My feet are sore, papa."
Me too.

819
00:53:13,126 --> 00:53:14,876
I prefer the Jordan.

820
00:53:15,084 --> 00:53:18,584
Yes. Me too, but do not
tell your mother right away.

821
00:53:18,792 --> 00:53:19,959
Why?

822
00:53:20,167 --> 00:53:24,084
"The last time I saw her,
I was barefoot on a boat."

823
00:53:24,292 --> 00:53:26,092
You have to show him that
things have changed.

824
00:53:26,116 --> 00:53:27,575
Do you think mom will love me?

825
00:53:28,292 --> 00:53:30,667
"Of course!" It's your mother.

826
00:53:32,126 --> 00:53:35,584
"And you think she's going to love you?"
Me? So that...

827
00:53:36,542 --> 00:53:37,917
It's another delirium.

828
00:53:57,542 --> 00:53:58,751
Mom!

829
00:54:07,334 --> 00:54:08,792
Mom...

830
00:54:22,376 --> 00:54:25,251
I'm so glad to see you.

831
00:54:28,417 --> 00:54:30,167
Me too.

832
00:54:38,334 --> 00:54:39,917
Good morning, Samuel.

833
00:54:41,334 --> 00:54:42,417
Hello.

834
00:54:45,792 --> 00:54:48,917
And your sunglasses?
We'll recognize you.

835
00:54:49,126 --> 00:54:50,876
"Will they recognize me?"

836
00:54:51,084 --> 00:54:54,667
Yes...
Mum had to secure the perimeter.

837
00:54:54,876 --> 00:54:56,417
- That's it?
- Yes.

838
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:58,167
Yes. Here.

839
00:54:58,376 --> 00:55:01,709
So we're connected?
I see no headset.

840
00:55:01,917 --> 00:55:05,376
- No, I do not have an earpiece.
- Because you do not see her.

841
00:55:05,584 --> 00:55:08,917
But she has a chip
directly on the eardrum.

842
00:55:09,126 --> 00:55:11,292
As it's inside, you
can not see it.

843
00:55:11,501 --> 00:55:14,626
Need a microscope.
Cool! They hear what they say?

844
00:55:14,834 --> 00:55:17,959
Yes, thanks to the
microphone in the tooth.

845
00:55:18,167 --> 00:55:20,459
It's an implant.
But there, it must be disabled.

846
00:55:20,667 --> 00:55:22,292
You confirm? We are.

847
00:55:22,501 --> 00:55:24,542
We're - cool, we're between us.

848
00:55:24,751 --> 00:55:26,071
What would make you
happy, Gloria?

849
00:55:26,251 --> 00:55:27,876
Do you want to eat ice cream?

850
00:55:28,084 --> 00:55:30,501
Walk around?
What do you want to do?

851
00:55:30,709 --> 00:55:31,709
It was planned.

852
00:55:31,876 --> 00:55:33,209
To go to the circus.

853
00:55:33,417 --> 00:55:35,751
If you want to eat ice cream,

854
00:55:35,959 --> 00:55:38,251
do it in the meantime.
As you wish.

855
00:55:38,459 --> 00:55:40,042
I'd like to show you my room.

856
00:55:41,084 --> 00:55:42,959
I'd love to see your room.

857
00:55:43,167 --> 00:55:44,417
"Can we, papa?"

858
00:55:45,834 --> 00:55:47,792
- Can we please?
- Yes.

859
00:55:48,001 --> 00:55:50,084
Yeah! Lets' go.

860
00:55:51,376 --> 00:55:52,959
Come on!

861
00:55:53,167 --> 00:55:56,417
That fuck up the circus
program, but we can...

862
00:55:58,292 --> 00:56:01,417
You have to explain the
earpiece and all that.

863
00:56:02,167 --> 00:56:05,667
You, you have to explain
the taxi and all that.

864
00:56:15,251 --> 00:56:16,876
Welcome.

865
00:56:18,042 --> 00:56:20,251
It's incredible here.

866
00:56:20,459 --> 00:56:23,834
"But it's up there, my room."
You come?

867
00:56:27,751 --> 00:56:30,459
I have a whole wall of lego.
No...

868
00:56:30,667 --> 00:56:31,959
If I swear to you.

869
00:56:35,876 --> 00:56:38,667
That's my dinosaurs. Here.

870
00:56:38,876 --> 00:56:41,084
That's my shark.

871
00:56:41,292 --> 00:56:43,917
And that's my giraffe
from Madagascar.

872
00:56:44,126 --> 00:56:46,167
"You went to Madagascar?"
- No.

873
00:56:46,376 --> 00:56:47,376
It is a cartoon.

874
00:56:48,167 --> 00:56:49,626
You do not know?

875
00:56:49,834 --> 00:56:52,042
But I did not see him.

876
00:56:52,251 --> 00:56:53,917
Mom has no time to
watch the movies.

877
00:56:54,126 --> 00:56:55,542
She knows the country. Hey?

878
00:56:55,751 --> 00:56:56,459
Yes.

879
00:56:56,667 --> 00:56:57,417
Oh, right?

880
00:56:57,626 --> 00:56:59,417
I did not know you were there.
Oh yes.

881
00:56:59,626 --> 00:57:00,626
Did you meet who?

882
00:57:01,667 --> 00:57:02,709
Uh...

883
00:57:03,917 --> 00:57:04,917
Eddie Murphy.

884
00:57:05,977 --> 00:57:06,977
<i>'Who </i>?

885
00:57:07,001 --> 00:57:10,209
Eddie Murphy.
He was in the Beverly hills cop,

886
00:57:11,501 --> 00:57:12,876
<i>in an armchair for two.</i>

887
00:57:13,084 --> 00:57:15,417
She did not see that. She is 8 years old.

888
00:57:15,626 --> 00:57:17,584
It was in doctor dol / file.

889
00:57:18,751 --> 00:57:20,959
She saw that. No? She knows?

890
00:57:21,167 --> 00:57:22,167
Eddie Murphy.

891
00:57:22,209 --> 00:57:23,251
It <i>is</i> in <i>Shrek.</i>

892
00:57:23,459 --> 00:57:24,542
Remember the donkey?

893
00:57:24,751 --> 00:57:26,126
It's his voice.

894
00:57:26,334 --> 00:57:27,334
Ah yes!

895
00:57:27,376 --> 00:57:29,459
"You definitely you need a tic tac.

896
00:57:29,667 --> 00:57:32,084
"Your breath stinks!" Here!

897
00:57:32,292 --> 00:57:33,792
She has an American accent.

898
00:57:34,001 --> 00:57:35,167
For a little English girl.

899
00:57:35,357 --> 00:57:36,477
She learned with the movies.

900
00:57:36,501 --> 00:57:39,001
She goes to the French school in London.
There is a good level.

901
00:57:39,209 --> 00:57:40,376
That is true?

902
00:57:40,584 --> 00:57:42,001
Your school is far away?

903
00:57:42,209 --> 00:57:43,709
No. We'll go tomorrow.

904
00:57:43,917 --> 00:57:45,459
You'll see my naughty teacher.

905
00:57:45,667 --> 00:57:47,167
"An naughty teacher?"

906
00:57:47,376 --> 00:57:48,667
Why naughty?

907
00:57:48,876 --> 00:57:51,459
I do not like her, she never laughs.

908
00:57:51,667 --> 00:57:53,001
He's a good teacher?

909
00:57:53,667 --> 00:57:56,792
Yes.
If you love depressive witches.

910
00:57:57,001 --> 00:57:59,709
Depressive witches, can't wait to meet her.

911
00:58:14,834 --> 00:58:17,834
She fell asleep at once.
No problem.

912
00:58:18,042 --> 00:58:19,626
It's all her.

913
00:58:22,876 --> 00:58:24,959
Why did not you
tell him the truth?

914
00:58:26,251 --> 00:58:28,001
I thought about it, yeah.

915
00:58:28,209 --> 00:58:31,667
But even looking good, I
have not found it correctly.

916
00:58:31,876 --> 00:58:34,042
To explain to him that his
mother had abandoned him.

917
00:58:34,876 --> 00:58:39,542
Even you, you prefer to be the
secret mamma that I invented. No?

918
00:58:44,292 --> 00:58:46,584
You made her a
wonderful little girl.

919
00:58:46,792 --> 00:58:48,959
I did not do it for you.

920
00:58:51,959 --> 00:58:55,542
- It was not easy, you know.
- Are you kidding?

921
00:58:55,751 --> 00:58:58,667
You left us like shit!

922
00:58:58,876 --> 00:59:01,501
We'll forgive you because
you answered a mail?

923
00:59:01,709 --> 00:59:03,542
I'm not asking you.

924
00:59:03,751 --> 00:59:06,042
I know it's unforgivable,
what I did.

925
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:07,626
"Then why did you do it?"

926
00:59:07,834 --> 00:59:10,626
I was lost.
I was doing anything.

927
00:59:12,251 --> 00:59:14,126
When I got pregnant,

928
00:59:14,334 --> 00:59:18,334
I thought I could get away with
it, but it got worse and worse.

929
00:59:18,542 --> 00:59:21,167
I could not impose that on a baby.

930
00:59:21,376 --> 00:59:24,292
A baby blues and you leave your
daughter to a guy who has jumped you!

931
00:59:24,501 --> 00:59:25,542
"To his father."

932
00:59:30,626 --> 00:59:32,417
I knew you'd be up to it.

933
00:59:32,626 --> 00:59:35,126
It lasted 8 years.
You know what it's like, eight?

934
00:59:36,667 --> 00:59:38,459
It's an eternity.

935
00:59:42,084 --> 00:59:45,001
I've been thinking of her
every day for 8 years.

936
00:59:45,209 --> 00:59:48,501
It's been 8 years since I was
ashamed, it's been 8 years since...

937
00:59:50,376 --> 00:59:53,292
That I tell myself that my
daughter will ever forgive me.

938
00:59:54,667 --> 00:59:57,042
I was afraid, and the
more time passed,

939
00:59:57,251 --> 01:00:00,501
the more I was afraid, because
a mother like me, we hate her.

940
01:00:00,709 --> 01:00:02,001
That's easy.

941
01:00:02,209 --> 01:00:03,459
No, it's not easy.

942
01:00:06,584 --> 01:00:08,024
I come back from a distance, Samuel.

943
01:00:11,292 --> 01:00:13,751
But thanks to you, I
have existed, for her.

944
01:00:16,917 --> 01:00:18,292
Thank you.

945
01:00:32,626 --> 01:00:34,417
You got a place to sleep?

946
01:00:36,126 --> 01:00:38,459
I'll find a hotel.

947
01:00:39,167 --> 01:00:41,292
You can stay here
tonight, if you want to.

948
01:00:41,501 --> 01:00:43,126
That is true?

949
01:00:43,334 --> 01:00:46,126
Yeah. It will make him happy.

950
01:01:22,376 --> 01:01:25,459
- And hop! Hi mom!
- Ah, you won.

951
01:01:25,667 --> 01:01:27,667
- Yeah.
- Hello. Are you ready?

952
01:01:27,876 --> 01:01:29,459
Yeah, yeah. I got up early.

953
01:01:30,376 --> 01:01:32,209
- Checkpoint!
- 8h16.

954
01:01:32,417 --> 01:01:33,584
We got a minute!

955
01:01:33,792 --> 01:01:34,876
- Laces.
- Laces.

956
01:01:35,084 --> 01:01:36,126
Slept well?

957
01:01:36,334 --> 01:01:38,959
Yes. I prepared a
breakfast for Gloria.

958
01:01:39,167 --> 01:01:41,209
Mom, we never eat here in the morning.

959
01:01:42,167 --> 01:01:45,084
Yeah. We prefer to sleep
more and eat on the way.

960
01:01:46,001 --> 01:01:47,834
- Checkpoint!
- 8h17.

961
01:01:48,042 --> 01:01:49,417
- Jacket.
- Jacket.

962
01:01:49,626 --> 01:01:50,667
Vitamins.

963
01:01:50,876 --> 01:01:53,084
- Hop!
- Thank you.

964
01:01:53,292 --> 01:01:55,001
We're ready. You come?

965
01:01:55,209 --> 01:01:56,834
Yes. We leave all this here?

966
01:01:57,042 --> 01:01:58,209
There are eggs, muffins.

967
01:01:58,417 --> 01:01:59,459
Even chouquettes.

968
01:02:00,042 --> 01:02:01,417
Oh yeah anyway.

969
01:02:01,626 --> 01:02:02,626
We got it.

970
01:02:02,709 --> 01:02:03,709
And dinner too.

971
01:02:04,501 --> 01:02:05,501
Checkpoint?

972
01:02:05,626 --> 01:02:07,334
- 8h18.
- Perfect.

973
01:02:07,542 --> 01:02:09,917
Backpack.

974
01:02:10,917 --> 01:02:12,209
Um yes.

975
01:02:44,042 --> 01:02:45,334
Good morning, Gloria.

976
01:02:45,542 --> 01:02:46,667
Hello madam.

977
01:02:46,876 --> 01:02:47,876
It is my mother.

978
01:02:48,042 --> 01:02:49,209
Hello madam.

979
01:02:49,417 --> 01:02:51,751
I am the director
of the institution.

980
01:02:51,959 --> 01:02:55,167
Glad to meet you at last.
Me too.

981
01:02:55,376 --> 01:02:56,976
"Come on, mamma, I'll
show you my class."

982
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,584
- Bye madam.
- Goodbye.

983
01:02:58,792 --> 01:03:00,042
Goodbye.

984
01:03:03,751 --> 01:03:05,584
"She paid for the
taxi and came back."

985
01:03:06,959 --> 01:03:10,001
The driver had no money...

986
01:03:11,376 --> 01:03:14,001
I have the episodes
of next week.

987
01:03:14,209 --> 01:03:16,834
I do not know if you saw them.

988
01:03:21,084 --> 01:03:24,126
"Sit in silence, please."

989
01:03:27,126 --> 01:03:29,209
Hello madam. I'm Gloria's mom.

990
01:03:29,417 --> 01:03:31,334
No parents in the class.

991
01:03:31,542 --> 01:03:32,751
It is the rule.

992
01:03:32,959 --> 01:03:34,167
Of course. Sorry.

993
01:03:34,376 --> 01:03:37,667
- Sorry.
- And again, she's cool.

994
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:41,191
"Are you coming for me tonight?"
If you want. At what time?

995
01:03:41,215 --> 01:03:42,876
- Normally...
- 15h30.

996
01:03:43,084 --> 01:03:45,001
It's written here. Just read.

997
01:03:45,209 --> 01:03:46,876
Gloria?

998
01:03:49,084 --> 01:03:51,417
- We hate her. No?
- Yeah.

999
01:03:56,084 --> 01:03:58,584
Good. By the time Gloria settled down,

1000
01:03:58,792 --> 01:04:00,667
you can open the notebooks.

1001
01:04:00,876 --> 01:04:04,917
Today we are going to talk
about the solar system:

1002
01:04:05,126 --> 01:04:09,209
The earth, the moon... Gloria.

1003
01:04:09,417 --> 01:04:10,417
Thank you.

1004
01:04:27,792 --> 01:04:30,251
Why are we here, Bernie?

1005
01:04:30,459 --> 01:04:31,626
The view is sublime.

1006
01:04:31,834 --> 01:04:33,584
- What?
- Get out of here, please.

1007
01:04:35,084 --> 01:04:36,584
Hello sir.

1008
01:04:38,042 --> 01:04:40,376
Did monsieur make his choice of tea?

1009
01:04:44,126 --> 01:04:45,417
Yes...

1010
01:04:46,042 --> 01:04:47,417
<i>A dis-z 'coke.</i>

1011
01:04:47,626 --> 01:04:48,834
I am sorry, sir.

1012
01:04:49,042 --> 01:04:51,042
We do not serve colas.

1013
01:04:51,251 --> 01:04:53,209
Get some tea, shit.
The tradition.

1014
01:04:53,417 --> 01:04:55,876
I knew it was a rough place.

1015
01:04:56,084 --> 01:04:58,209
I was sure of it.

1016
01:05:00,251 --> 01:05:01,417
An ice tea.

1017
01:05:01,626 --> 01:05:02,626
Sorry?

1018
01:05:02,709 --> 01:05:03,709
My god.

1019
01:05:03,834 --> 01:05:05,917
Tea with ice in it.

1020
01:05:06,126 --> 01:05:08,251
Tea with ice, inside.

1021
01:05:08,709 --> 01:05:10,751
It's tea, it's not a.

1022
01:05:10,959 --> 01:05:12,876
It's not a - no.

1023
01:05:13,084 --> 01:05:15,876
"I am confused, sir.
He is French."

1024
01:05:16,084 --> 01:05:17,084
It's tea.

1025
01:05:17,167 --> 01:05:18,376
It's not a colas.

1026
01:05:18,584 --> 01:05:21,251
Yes, we understood that. Oh...

1027
01:05:22,959 --> 01:05:25,167
"Are you gonna check
it all afternoon?"

1028
01:05:25,376 --> 01:05:28,501
"He comes here every Thursday."
He makes me his show.

1029
01:05:28,709 --> 01:05:30,251
He drives me crazy.

1030
01:05:33,084 --> 01:05:34,417
"This father of a family?"

1031
01:05:34,626 --> 01:05:37,542
It's a blanket!
He's gay. It shows.

1032
01:05:37,751 --> 01:05:39,042
You got drunk.

1033
01:05:39,251 --> 01:05:40,251
What?

1034
01:05:40,292 --> 01:05:43,667
Your chandeliers at 6 billion, your
tea, your papas dep, it's too much.

1035
01:05:43,876 --> 01:05:45,376
It's okay. Take a seat.

1036
01:05:45,584 --> 01:05:46,824
You do not even listen to me.

1037
01:05:46,876 --> 01:05:48,417
- Tell me about it.
- Tell what?

1038
01:05:48,626 --> 01:05:49,626
About Kristin.

1039
01:05:49,792 --> 01:05:52,501
If she comes fuck shit in the
family, it's not worth it.

1040
01:05:53,501 --> 01:05:55,042
You're having a fit of jealousy.

1041
01:05:55,251 --> 01:05:58,542
Nothing to see.
It's just that I see you more.

1042
01:05:58,751 --> 01:05:59,501
It's been 2 days.

1043
01:05:59,709 --> 01:06:01,469
- It's too much.
- It pleases the little one.

1044
01:06:01,542 --> 01:06:05,501
I have a say.
I'm a little bit like that child's mother.

1045
01:06:05,709 --> 01:06:06,709
Stopped.

1046
01:06:06,917 --> 01:06:08,126
More than her.

1047
01:06:08,334 --> 01:06:10,417
Do not worry. She's lost.

1048
01:06:10,626 --> 01:06:12,459
She came to see Gloria
and she will leave.

1049
01:06:12,667 --> 01:06:14,792
"But she is sleeping at home."

1050
01:06:15,792 --> 01:06:17,292
You laid back with her?

1051
01:06:17,501 --> 01:06:18,501
"I'm not fine?"

1052
01:06:18,584 --> 01:06:20,751
- She is big?
- Oh, no.

1053
01:06:20,959 --> 01:06:23,084
You laid back with her!

1054
01:06:23,292 --> 01:06:25,751
I was sure of it.
Stop with that!

1055
01:06:25,959 --> 01:06:27,501
She stays with Gloria.

1056
01:06:29,126 --> 01:06:31,917
You promise me that there is not
an ounce of seduction between you.

1057
01:06:32,667 --> 01:06:34,459
Not an iota.

1058
01:06:36,292 --> 01:06:39,292
That's right, people
say I'm a stuntman.

1059
01:06:39,501 --> 01:06:40,542
That is true.

1060
01:06:40,751 --> 01:06:43,501
Let's say that the
cinema has fallen on me.

1061
01:06:43,709 --> 01:06:45,334
And I fall in the movies.

1062
01:06:45,542 --> 01:06:46,834
Stuntman.

1063
01:06:47,042 --> 01:06:51,376
Tom cruise, jacky chan, bébel...
<i>'Who</i>?

1064
01:06:52,167 --> 01:06:53,501
Belmondo, Jean-Paul.

1065
01:06:56,917 --> 01:06:59,834
If you want a picture
of your lovely family...

1066
01:07:00,042 --> 01:07:01,376
Thank you.

1067
01:07:02,501 --> 01:07:03,917
What's the matter?

1068
01:07:05,334 --> 01:07:08,834
Nothing. He says we're
a lovely little family.

1069
01:07:09,042 --> 01:07:10,251
Oh, right?

1070
01:07:12,792 --> 01:07:14,667
It is true that it is not false.

1071
01:07:17,459 --> 01:07:18,917
Why not?

1072
01:07:21,709 --> 01:07:23,876
No, because I have someone.

1073
01:07:26,626 --> 01:07:28,084
Ah super.

1074
01:07:28,292 --> 01:07:30,584
We met four years ago in New York.
It is serious.

1075
01:07:30,792 --> 01:07:32,209
We live together.

1076
01:07:32,417 --> 01:07:34,251
He's a very good person.

1077
01:07:34,459 --> 01:07:36,626
It's thanks to him... it's cool.

1078
01:07:36,834 --> 01:07:38,626
That I got out...

1079
01:07:42,167 --> 01:07:44,626
I did not dare tell you about
it, but it just happened.

1080
01:07:44,834 --> 01:07:46,542
In London and...

1081
01:07:46,751 --> 01:07:48,501
I would like to present it to you.

1082
01:07:49,376 --> 01:07:51,001
Great boss. It's cool.

1083
01:07:51,959 --> 01:07:53,417
Very cool.

1084
01:07:54,417 --> 01:07:58,209
- Well, if it's possible. Me I...
- Yes it's possible.

1085
01:07:58,417 --> 01:08:02,001
We need to organize, what.
But it is possible.

1086
01:08:03,042 --> 01:08:04,209
No problem.

1087
01:08:12,959 --> 01:08:14,167
Here, Gloria.

1088
01:08:15,626 --> 01:08:17,167
What? He's there?

1089
01:08:18,626 --> 01:08:20,209
Ah yes, he's there.

1090
01:08:29,959 --> 01:08:32,001
Hello. You must be Gloria.

1091
01:08:32,584 --> 01:08:33,667
Yes.

1092
01:08:33,876 --> 01:08:34,876
Hello.

1093
01:08:35,084 --> 01:08:36,959
And you're... Samuel, right?

1094
01:08:37,167 --> 01:08:38,376
Right...

1095
01:08:43,126 --> 01:08:46,417
Lowell. I prefer om. Sorry.

1096
01:08:47,584 --> 01:08:48,751
What?

1097
01:08:48,959 --> 01:08:51,709
Uh... Ol, om, teams.

1098
01:08:51,917 --> 01:08:53,376
- Soccer.
- Ah, football.

1099
01:08:53,584 --> 01:08:54,584
That's it.

1100
01:08:54,751 --> 01:08:55,751
Paris Saint germain.

1101
01:08:55,792 --> 01:08:57,626
No. I prefer the other.

1102
01:08:57,834 --> 01:08:59,084
I prefer om.

1103
01:08:59,834 --> 01:09:01,292
He does not speak English.

1104
01:09:01,501 --> 01:09:05,209
Yes, of course. Hold on. He speaks.

1105
01:09:05,417 --> 01:09:06,709
Sometimes a little.

1106
01:09:06,917 --> 01:09:08,251
Sometimes, no.

1107
01:09:08,459 --> 01:09:09,834
It depends, in fact.

1108
01:09:10,042 --> 01:09:12,751
It depends, but he speaks.
Of course.

1109
01:09:12,959 --> 01:09:14,626
What do you think?

1110
01:09:14,834 --> 01:09:17,376
Well, do you sit in there?

1111
01:09:17,584 --> 01:09:19,334
We'll be better. No?

1112
01:09:19,542 --> 01:09:20,709
Yes.

1113
01:09:20,917 --> 01:09:22,626
- What do you think?
- Yes.

1114
01:09:22,834 --> 01:09:23,501
Say it.

1115
01:09:23,709 --> 01:09:25,001
Sit in it.

1116
01:09:25,209 --> 01:09:27,001
It's good. Come on!

1117
01:09:27,209 --> 01:09:30,542
My dad is the best man ever.
Everyone wants to work with him.

1118
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:33,209
You know Jack bates?

1119
01:09:33,417 --> 01:09:34,417
Of course.

1120
01:09:34,542 --> 01:09:35,667
Well, it's him.

1121
01:09:35,876 --> 01:09:36,667
Oh, right?

1122
01:09:36,876 --> 01:09:38,459
It's me!

1123
01:09:39,959 --> 01:09:42,084
"And the real actor in the series?"

1124
01:09:42,292 --> 01:09:45,084
"The only risk he takes
is smoking cigarettes."

1125
01:09:45,292 --> 01:09:46,751
Dad does all the rest.

1126
01:09:46,959 --> 01:09:49,459
Wow! That is pretty impressive.

1127
01:09:49,667 --> 01:09:51,167
Yes, I am!

1128
01:09:54,209 --> 01:09:56,792
- You did not want to go to the bathroom?
- Yes.

1129
01:09:57,001 --> 01:09:58,251
Me too. Let's go.

1130
01:09:58,751 --> 01:10:00,209
We will be back.

1131
01:10:00,417 --> 01:10:01,417
Ok.

1132
01:10:20,876 --> 01:10:23,667
I love "bucu" "the" France.

1133
01:10:24,251 --> 01:10:25,376
What?

1134
01:10:26,501 --> 01:10:29,209
"France. I like "bucu".

1135
01:10:29,917 --> 01:10:32,084
"Ah! Okay.

1136
01:10:32,292 --> 01:10:33,876
"The" France, yes.

1137
01:10:34,084 --> 01:10:35,084
Okay. So...

1138
01:10:35,292 --> 01:10:37,667
You like "bucu" tout "le" France.

1139
01:10:37,876 --> 01:10:40,334
Or a part of "the" France?

1140
01:10:41,542 --> 01:10:42,542
What?

1141
01:10:42,667 --> 01:10:47,167
I like "bucu"
the south of "the" France.

1142
01:10:49,209 --> 01:10:50,334
The "zaousse".

1143
01:10:50,542 --> 01:10:51,876
The "zaousse"?

1144
01:10:52,084 --> 01:10:55,417
Yes, the "zaousse".
At the seaside.

1145
01:10:55,626 --> 01:10:57,584
Ok... the south.

1146
01:10:57,792 --> 01:10:59,334
That's what I said.

1147
01:11:01,251 --> 01:11:02,709
The "zaousse"!

1148
01:11:03,251 --> 01:11:04,251
Very good.

1149
01:11:04,459 --> 01:11:06,542
Yeah, very good.

1150
01:11:08,417 --> 01:11:09,457
He does not care about me.

1151
01:11:12,959 --> 01:11:14,167
He does not care about me.

1152
01:11:14,792 --> 01:11:17,084
There is a toilet
for 300 people.

1153
01:11:19,667 --> 01:11:22,709
"Why do you prefer
lowell more than daddy?"

1154
01:11:24,584 --> 01:11:26,251
But I never said that.

1155
01:11:27,292 --> 01:11:31,626
No, but if you thought the other way
around, you'd be at home with us.

1156
01:11:33,251 --> 01:11:37,251
We can see each other without
living in the same house.

1157
01:11:37,876 --> 01:11:40,084
It does not mean we love each other less.

1158
01:11:41,417 --> 01:11:42,626
Okay?

1159
01:11:46,917 --> 01:11:48,792
Look at me, Gloria.

1160
01:11:52,084 --> 01:11:54,459
I'll never leave you.

1161
01:11:55,709 --> 01:11:57,126
Okay?

1162
01:11:59,292 --> 01:12:00,792
I promise you.

1163
01:12:04,209 --> 01:12:06,709
Come here, come.

1164
01:12:16,626 --> 01:12:20,501
Can I avoid kids clothes
when I have a thermal suit?

1165
01:12:20,709 --> 01:12:23,209
- Hi, my cat.
- It would be good.

1166
01:12:23,417 --> 01:12:24,709
Whore! Shit!

1167
01:12:24,917 --> 01:12:26,834
- Thank you.
- Thank you!

1168
01:12:27,042 --> 01:12:29,126
1000 hours to dress!

1169
01:12:29,334 --> 01:12:32,292
Whore! This is the end of the day!
"Stop there!"

1170
01:12:32,501 --> 01:12:35,126
It's not our fault that
Kristin has a guy.

1171
01:12:35,334 --> 01:12:37,959
Nothing to see. I do not
understand what she finds.

1172
01:12:38,167 --> 01:12:40,167
- He's fat?
- Not especially.

1173
01:12:40,376 --> 01:12:42,709
It's a little disgusting little bastard.

1174
01:12:42,917 --> 01:12:44,501
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

1175
01:12:44,709 --> 01:12:45,834
Dad, I have a surprise.

1176
01:12:49,876 --> 01:12:51,584
Is this sublime guy?

1177
01:12:52,876 --> 01:12:54,834
I'll die, he has
the tom Ford news.

1178
01:12:55,042 --> 01:12:56,042
He is small.

1179
01:12:56,209 --> 01:12:57,876
Can I talk to you, Gloria?

1180
01:12:59,626 --> 01:13:01,417
- Hello.
- Hello.

1181
01:13:01,626 --> 01:13:04,334
Gloria insisted.
Is not that a problem?

1182
01:13:04,542 --> 01:13:07,334
Well, you know. In fact no.
Sorry excuse me.

1183
01:13:07,542 --> 01:13:08,709
Without warning,

1184
01:13:08,917 --> 01:13:11,209
it is complicated.
There are standards.

1185
01:13:11,417 --> 01:13:13,167
Hein... hey, Bernie?

1186
01:13:13,376 --> 01:13:16,459
Secured, insurance...
It is cheese. No?

1187
01:13:17,834 --> 01:13:19,209
Cheese? Not really.

1188
01:13:19,417 --> 01:13:21,584
- Okay.
- Do not worry.

1189
01:13:21,792 --> 01:13:24,626
Me, it's Bernie, the producer.
Nice to meet you.

1190
01:13:26,167 --> 01:13:28,751
We'll set you up to look at me.

1191
01:13:28,959 --> 01:13:30,376
It is fabulous. You will see.

1192
01:13:30,584 --> 01:13:32,626
Be my guest, I'll be there in a minute.

1193
01:13:32,834 --> 01:13:33,834
Over there?

1194
01:13:33,876 --> 01:13:37,251
Be the guest... No problem.

1195
01:13:39,501 --> 01:13:41,792
On the other hand I
reassure you, he's gay.

1196
01:13:42,001 --> 01:13:43,459
Stop please.

1197
01:13:43,667 --> 01:13:45,334
"Why is he here?"

1198
01:13:45,542 --> 01:13:46,626
To watch us.

1199
01:13:46,834 --> 01:13:50,042
"He may like stuntmen."
That's it.

1200
01:13:50,251 --> 01:13:52,209
All is said.

1201
01:13:54,209 --> 01:13:55,209
Perfect!

1202
01:13:55,417 --> 01:13:56,417
But even more.

1203
01:13:56,626 --> 01:13:57,792
It must burn alive.

1204
01:13:58,001 --> 01:13:58,667
Glo!

1205
01:13:58,876 --> 01:14:01,042
Come and see, dear.

1206
01:14:01,834 --> 01:14:03,417
I do not feel it, the scene.

1207
01:14:03,626 --> 01:14:06,917
You ask them to leave the
1st floor, not the 3rd?

1208
01:14:07,126 --> 01:14:09,917
Hey? We'll play it soft.
I do not know, it's...

1209
01:14:10,126 --> 01:14:11,542
A feeling.

1210
01:14:11,751 --> 01:14:14,501
- Okay, I'm asking.
- Thank you darling.

1211
01:14:17,376 --> 01:14:18,667
I love what you do.

1212
01:14:18,876 --> 01:14:20,626
It's great to meet you.

1213
01:14:20,834 --> 01:14:23,959
This is the most important
scene of the season.

1214
01:14:24,167 --> 01:14:27,042
A big waterfall.
Bates jumps from a building on fire.

1215
01:14:28,084 --> 01:14:29,334
Samuel will jump from up there.

1216
01:14:30,709 --> 01:14:32,376
That is really?

1217
01:14:33,334 --> 01:14:36,751
Is not little bit dangerous?
"Yes, that is the point."

1218
01:14:38,917 --> 01:14:40,251
Do not worry about him.

1219
01:14:40,459 --> 01:14:42,084
From the 3rd floor, kid could do it.

1220
01:14:42,292 --> 01:14:43,792
I thought it is the 6th?

1221
01:14:44,001 --> 01:14:46,334
That would be great,
but I doubt he'll be great.

1222
01:14:46,542 --> 01:14:48,751
"He says he wants to
do it from more."

1223
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:50,709
"Would he jump off the 6th floor?"

1224
01:14:50,917 --> 01:14:51,917
No.

1225
01:14:53,042 --> 01:14:54,042
From the 11th floor.

1226
01:14:55,352 --> 01:14:56,352
"11th?"

1227
01:14:56,376 --> 01:14:57,751
This is the top floor.

1228
01:14:57,959 --> 01:15:00,584
"He wants to show my mother
how courageous he is."

1229
01:15:00,792 --> 01:15:01,542
Ok.

1230
01:15:01,751 --> 01:15:02,951
OK, that's great. Let's do it!

1231
01:15:03,017 --> 01:15:04,876
You are the man, Sam!

1232
01:15:05,084 --> 01:15:06,084
Here!

1233
01:15:06,251 --> 01:15:08,542
One floor, we agree.
Thank you my friend.

1234
01:15:08,751 --> 01:15:10,792
We're gonna rip everything up.

1235
01:15:12,001 --> 01:15:14,084
It's exciting, is not it?

1236
01:15:14,667 --> 01:15:15,792
OK guys, let's go!

1237
01:15:17,167 --> 01:15:18,167
We're going up.

1238
01:15:33,042 --> 01:15:35,001
Hold on. What are you doing?

1239
01:15:35,209 --> 01:15:38,209
What are you doing?

1240
01:15:38,417 --> 01:15:40,167
One, I said "one."

1241
01:15:40,584 --> 01:15:41,584
You said eleven.

1242
01:15:41,709 --> 01:15:44,376
Eleven? You're maboul or what?
No way.

1243
01:15:44,584 --> 01:15:45,709
No no. Stop!

1244
01:15:45,917 --> 01:15:48,209
Stop that. Chopped off. Chopped off.

1245
01:15:48,417 --> 01:15:49,876
I do not have control.

1246
01:15:50,084 --> 01:15:50,626
Stopped.

1247
01:15:50,834 --> 01:15:51,876
It's automated.

1248
01:15:52,084 --> 01:15:53,751
What, "totomatisé"? Stop that.

1249
01:15:53,959 --> 01:15:54,751
Stop I.

1250
01:15:54,959 --> 01:15:56,876
Never will I jump
eleven stories on fire!

1251
01:15:57,084 --> 01:15:58,459
You realize?

1252
01:15:58,667 --> 01:16:00,334
Do not shout at me.

1253
01:16:00,542 --> 01:16:02,709
I'm feeling dizzy, please.

1254
01:16:02,917 --> 01:16:04,459
Are you ready?

1255
01:16:04,667 --> 01:16:05,751
Almost.

1256
01:16:05,959 --> 01:16:06,626
Great!

1257
01:16:06,834 --> 01:16:07,834
<i>Cameras?.</i>

1258
01:16:08,001 --> 01:16:10,084
No no no! Cut!

1259
01:16:10,292 --> 01:16:11,042
Cut!

1260
01:16:11,251 --> 01:16:12,417
Cut that!

1261
01:16:12,626 --> 01:16:16,167
I do not move if I'm not
on the 1st floor. Ok?

1262
01:16:18,084 --> 01:16:19,376
He wants to do it from the 1st.

1263
01:16:19,584 --> 01:16:22,459
What? You kidding? What a fuck?

1264
01:16:23,251 --> 01:16:24,501
Gloria, a word please.

1265
01:16:27,667 --> 01:16:30,876
We had an agreement.
You said he would jump from the 11th.

1266
01:16:31,084 --> 01:16:32,626
"What's he doing to her?"

1267
01:16:32,834 --> 01:16:36,126
He does not care about me?
It's not the empire state building!

1268
01:16:36,334 --> 01:16:37,459
What's he doing?

1269
01:16:38,459 --> 01:16:40,751
Your daughter said eleven. She lied.

1270
01:16:40,959 --> 01:16:41,959
Hold on!

1271
01:16:42,001 --> 01:16:43,292
Stop! Okay?

1272
01:16:43,501 --> 01:16:46,126
You do not talk to her like that.
She's my daughter.

1273
01:16:46,334 --> 01:16:49,001
He said what?
What he says to me now?

1274
01:16:49,209 --> 01:16:50,289
You translate or you gland?

1275
01:16:50,459 --> 01:16:52,876
Hold on... He is a
stuntman or a performer?

1276
01:16:53,084 --> 01:16:55,542
What is he: Man or a mouse?
I am a guru!

1277
01:16:55,751 --> 01:16:57,917
I will do it! Ok for 11.

1278
01:16:58,126 --> 01:16:59,501
Tell him "ok for 11."

1279
01:16:59,709 --> 01:17:00,751
She's not lying.

1280
01:17:01,876 --> 01:17:04,251
"He's going to jump off the top floor."

1281
01:17:04,459 --> 01:17:05,792
Bring the airbags!

1282
01:17:06,001 --> 01:17:08,709
I do not have time to deal with this creep.

1283
01:17:08,917 --> 01:17:10,042
Lets' go.

1284
01:17:25,042 --> 01:17:26,834
Fuck, Gloria.

1285
01:17:32,001 --> 01:17:33,001
"Be quiet!"

1286
01:17:34,501 --> 01:17:36,626
cameras!

1287
01:17:43,001 --> 01:17:44,667
8-176. One.

1288
01:17:45,602 --> 01:17:47,709
Action!

1289
01:17:47,917 --> 01:17:49,292
Action!

1290
01:18:05,417 --> 01:18:06,917
Cut.

1291
01:18:07,126 --> 01:18:08,126
Sublime!

1292
01:18:11,292 --> 01:18:13,084
He's not moving.

1293
01:18:13,292 --> 01:18:15,917
My god! Call Emergency!

1294
01:18:23,959 --> 01:18:25,167
Let it pass.

1295
01:18:25,376 --> 01:18:26,834
I'm here.

1296
01:18:27,042 --> 01:18:29,042
No help, he just needs me.

1297
01:18:31,834 --> 01:18:33,251
Dad.

1298
01:18:33,459 --> 01:18:35,709
Awake, you are immortal.

1299
01:18:43,459 --> 01:18:44,626
Dad.

1300
01:18:44,834 --> 01:18:46,667
Awake, you are immortal.

1301
01:18:52,167 --> 01:18:53,459
Papa 'g.

1302
01:18:53,667 --> 01:18:54,959
Sam, answer.

1303
01:18:56,126 --> 01:18:57,334
It' ok mate?

1304
01:19:02,792 --> 01:19:04,251
Yes I am!

1305
01:19:06,667 --> 01:19:07,751
Too strong!

1306
01:19:07,959 --> 01:19:09,209
He is alive!

1307
01:19:10,501 --> 01:19:11,584
He is alive!

1308
01:19:12,917 --> 01:19:13,917
Thank you.

1309
01:19:13,959 --> 01:19:15,876
"But speak more like that
to my daughter." Ok?

1310
01:19:16,876 --> 01:19:18,667
Yeah, okay. Back to work!

1311
01:19:18,876 --> 01:19:19,876
Back to work!

1312
01:19:20,042 --> 01:19:23,251
- Come on, are you okay?
- Yeah, thanks. It's okay.

1313
01:19:32,001 --> 01:19:33,126
It will be fine?

1314
01:19:40,917 --> 01:19:44,459
Did she tell you what in the ear?
It's a game between us.

1315
01:19:44,667 --> 01:19:47,227
I pretend to be dead.
She thinks she is bringing me back to life.

1316
01:19:48,917 --> 01:19:50,417
Another lie.

1317
01:19:51,834 --> 01:19:53,709
That's it. Another lie.

1318
01:19:57,001 --> 01:19:59,667
"What will happen
when she finds out?"

1319
01:19:59,876 --> 01:20:01,709
"You give me lessons?" You?

1320
01:20:01,917 --> 01:20:04,334
"No, but one day she'll grow up."

1321
01:20:04,834 --> 01:20:06,626
Stop please.

1322
01:20:11,459 --> 01:20:13,542
I want to tell him the truth about me.

1323
01:20:13,751 --> 01:20:15,584
It would be better for her.

1324
01:20:15,792 --> 01:20:18,751
For her? You do not
know what's good for her.

1325
01:20:18,959 --> 01:20:20,334
You know nothing.

1326
01:20:20,542 --> 01:20:24,084
So you're not going to say anything at all.
We forget this conversation.

1327
01:20:24,292 --> 01:20:25,876
I am going to rest. I am tired.

1328
01:20:26,084 --> 01:20:27,667
I'm going to mix in the countries.

1329
01:20:27,876 --> 01:20:28,876
I do not know Obama.

1330
01:20:29,001 --> 01:20:32,376
I'm not a secret agent!
That is the truth!

1331
01:21:23,292 --> 01:21:24,584
Thank you so much.

1332
01:21:24,792 --> 01:21:25,792
See you soon.

1333
01:21:25,917 --> 01:21:27,501
Yes, very soon.

1334
01:21:32,626 --> 01:21:36,126
- Goodbye, Gloria.
- No, I want to come with you.

1335
01:21:36,334 --> 01:21:38,042
We'll go see mom tomorrow.

1336
01:21:38,251 --> 01:21:40,876
I'm not talking to you.
You liar!

1337
01:21:41,084 --> 01:21:42,626
Calm down, darling...

1338
01:21:42,834 --> 01:21:44,876
I do not want to go with you!

1339
01:21:45,084 --> 01:21:47,084
I want to go with you, mom.

1340
01:21:54,042 --> 01:21:56,167
Well, come on, we'll talk...

1341
01:21:57,084 --> 01:21:58,376
I will call you tomorrow.

1342
01:22:21,167 --> 01:22:22,292
Started.

1343
01:22:38,501 --> 01:22:40,709
You do not want to sleep at home?

1344
01:22:41,584 --> 01:22:42,709
With you?

1345
01:22:42,917 --> 01:22:46,209
Yeah...
A small head-spade to the old.

1346
01:22:47,167 --> 01:22:49,334
Not sure if it makes
me feel better.

1347
01:22:49,542 --> 01:22:53,334
Do not worry. A good night's
sleep on it, it'll be fine.

1348
01:22:53,542 --> 01:22:56,376
This is the first time I
will not put him to sleep.

1349
01:22:56,584 --> 01:23:00,542
She's coming back.
Just give him a little time.

1350
01:23:02,792 --> 01:23:04,376
I do not have time.

1351
01:23:05,376 --> 01:23:08,584
Yeah, I know, buddy. I know.

1352
01:23:16,417 --> 01:23:18,501
Come on... beers.

1353
01:23:55,376 --> 01:23:58,709
Hello, it's Kristin.
Leave a message, thanks.

1354
01:25:07,292 --> 01:25:08,751
How is she?

1355
01:25:08,959 --> 01:25:10,917
"She falls asleep always so quickly."

1356
01:25:11,126 --> 01:25:14,917
I do not understand. It's
against you she should be angry.

1357
01:25:15,126 --> 01:25:18,667
Today she asked to see you.
He misses you.

1358
01:25:19,376 --> 01:25:21,959
Must go in and everything
is the same as before.

1359
01:25:22,959 --> 01:25:24,959
It may not be like before.

1360
01:25:25,167 --> 01:25:26,626
That is to say?

1361
01:25:26,834 --> 01:25:31,251
Things have changed.
We will find an equitable solution.

1362
01:25:31,459 --> 01:25:34,792
Stopped. I raised her.
It will never be fair.

1363
01:25:35,001 --> 01:25:38,501
I'd like to see her more.
Catch up the time I lost.

1364
01:25:38,709 --> 01:25:41,917
"Yes, when you pass in the
corner, you call us!"

1365
01:25:42,126 --> 01:25:43,834
Go on Facebook, now
that you master.

1366
01:25:44,042 --> 01:25:46,002
"Stop, I should like to
have it also at my house."

1367
01:25:46,026 --> 01:25:47,026
Habites is in New York!

1368
01:25:47,209 --> 01:25:48,334
We can get organized.

1369
01:25:48,542 --> 01:25:51,167
No! My daughter and I
are very well organized.

1370
01:25:51,376 --> 01:25:54,417
There are lots of happy
children with separated parents.

1371
01:25:54,626 --> 01:25:58,001
And full of happy children,
alone with their father!

1372
01:25:58,209 --> 01:26:01,042
You give me a second chance.
I seized her.

1373
01:26:01,251 --> 01:26:05,001
I gave you nothing.
I allowed Gloria to see her mother.

1374
01:26:05,209 --> 01:26:07,626
"Now I am here, I
am his mother."

1375
01:26:07,834 --> 01:26:10,084
You're gonna take her out and
stop me from seeing her?

1376
01:26:13,376 --> 01:26:16,292
We will not go so far as to
settle this before a judge.

1377
01:26:16,501 --> 01:26:20,251
A judge? Are we in there?
It goes to the penal, downright!

1378
01:26:20,459 --> 01:26:21,917
Ben. Go ahead!

1379
01:26:22,126 --> 01:26:24,667
Go and tell everything to your judge!
He'll love it!

1380
01:26:24,876 --> 01:26:27,084
Meanwhile, Gloria stays with me!

1381
01:26:27,292 --> 01:26:29,167
His house is here,

1382
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:31,376
his school is here, his life is here!

1383
01:26:31,584 --> 01:26:33,292
End of the discussion.

1384
01:26:33,501 --> 01:26:35,501
We stop the bullshit!

1385
01:26:36,376 --> 01:26:38,459
- Hi, Sam.
- Shut up!

1386
01:26:43,042 --> 01:26:44,584
It's me, darling.

1387
01:26:45,751 --> 01:26:48,542
We go home now.

1388
01:26:53,167 --> 01:26:55,209
You're doing a lot of bullshit.

1389
01:26:55,417 --> 01:26:57,876
You did it eight years ago.
It's too late.

1390
01:27:03,792 --> 01:27:05,917
Now you have more choice.

1391
01:27:08,584 --> 01:27:09,959
Sir.

1392
01:27:26,626 --> 01:27:28,084
Excuse me, my dear.

1393
01:27:29,376 --> 01:27:31,459
I did not want to lie to you.

1394
01:27:32,126 --> 01:27:33,709
It was for your good.

1395
01:27:34,917 --> 01:27:39,167
Sometimes, for the good of the
people, you have to lie a little.

1396
01:27:42,084 --> 01:27:44,709
Everything will go
back as before.

1397
01:28:15,209 --> 01:28:16,417
Good morning everyone.

1398
01:28:16,626 --> 01:28:18,876
We are gathered here today.

1399
01:28:19,084 --> 01:28:21,876
To Kristin Stuart.

1400
01:28:22,084 --> 01:28:23,542
VS Samuel Abelli,

1401
01:28:23,751 --> 01:28:26,459
to determine custody,

1402
01:28:26,667 --> 01:28:29,126
Of their eight-year-old daughter, Gloria.

1403
01:28:29,334 --> 01:28:30,876
The mother will speak first.

1404
01:28:31,417 --> 01:28:33,417
Ms. Stuart, step forward.

1405
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:34,792
It will be fine.

1406
01:28:36,334 --> 01:28:37,814
He was preparing that, the bastard.

1407
01:28:37,838 --> 01:28:39,209
And he's getting the lawyer.

1408
01:28:39,417 --> 01:28:41,042
I should have known.

1409
01:28:41,251 --> 01:28:43,959
I'm going to get screwed in English.
I will understand nothing.

1410
01:28:44,167 --> 01:28:45,292
Tell the truth.

1411
01:28:45,501 --> 01:28:48,621
No I can not... put on
your headset, then.

1412
01:28:48,792 --> 01:28:52,459
- What?
- For English. Put on your headset.

1413
01:28:52,876 --> 01:28:56,251
- Which channel, French?
- 5.

1414
01:28:56,459 --> 01:28:57,542
You're welcome.

1415
01:29:01,209 --> 01:29:06,626
"I know it's unforgivable
to abandon your child."

1416
01:29:07,876 --> 01:29:08,876
I understad that.

1417
01:29:09,876 --> 01:29:14,084
That my past actions can not
be excused or undone.

1418
01:29:16,542 --> 01:29:18,792
But I do not want to
lose my daughter again.

1419
01:29:22,459 --> 01:29:24,001
I'd like to thank Samuel.

1420
01:29:29,751 --> 01:29:32,417
He's been wonderful father...

1421
01:29:33,667 --> 01:29:35,876
I wish I had not come this far.

1422
01:29:38,667 --> 01:29:42,667
I can never make up the lost years,
and I live with that every day.

1423
01:29:44,001 --> 01:29:45,767
But I want to be mother to my daugter now.

1424
01:29:47,334 --> 01:29:51,501
I hope you will give
us and I this right.

1425
01:29:54,417 --> 01:29:57,709
The question is: "Is not
it too late, young lady?"

1426
01:29:59,834 --> 01:30:00,876
I do not know.

1427
01:30:04,042 --> 01:30:05,042
Next.

1428
01:30:14,542 --> 01:30:16,084
In your own time, sir.

1429
01:30:17,376 --> 01:30:19,167
Any mother would dream of a father,

1430
01:30:19,376 --> 01:30:21,251
like Samuel for his child.

1431
01:30:22,584 --> 01:30:25,584
He's a superman
and no one knows.

1432
01:30:25,792 --> 01:30:26,917
Which he had to overcome.

1433
01:30:27,126 --> 01:30:30,251
I assure you that he raises his
daughter in the best way possible.

1434
01:30:30,459 --> 01:30:32,167
His way.

1435
01:30:32,376 --> 01:30:33,376
Beacause this man.

1436
01:30:33,584 --> 01:30:35,417
Has turned all his
life so that Gloria.

1437
01:30:35,626 --> 01:30:37,834
Have the happiest life possible.

1438
01:30:39,001 --> 01:30:40,334
<i>In fact,</i>

1439
01:30:40,667 --> 01:30:43,334
I remember our meeting. We were.

1440
01:30:44,167 --> 01:30:45,167
<i>In the tube,</i>

1441
01:30:46,251 --> 01:30:49,542
Gloria was in great danger at
the foot of the escalator.

1442
01:30:49,751 --> 01:30:51,167
Alone. And I saw this man.

1443
01:30:51,376 --> 01:30:53,167
Risk her life to save her.

1444
01:30:53,376 --> 01:30:54,792
At that very moment,

1445
01:30:55,001 --> 01:30:58,334
I knew he was ment
to be a father.

1446
01:31:00,126 --> 01:31:01,834
And stuntman.

1447
01:31:04,042 --> 01:31:05,792
The question is:

1448
01:31:06,001 --> 01:31:09,376
"Why did he leave his baby
unattended in the subway?"

1449
01:31:12,626 --> 01:31:13,709
Hmm?

1450
01:31:15,959 --> 01:31:16,959
I have met.

1451
01:31:17,126 --> 01:31:18,876
Many parents of students.

1452
01:31:19,084 --> 01:31:21,667
During my career in education.

1453
01:31:21,876 --> 01:31:25,292
I must say that Mr. abelli
is, without a doubt,

1454
01:31:25,501 --> 01:31:27,084
the most endearing father.

1455
01:31:27,292 --> 01:31:28,834
I had the opportunity to meet.

1456
01:31:29,542 --> 01:31:30,542
It transforms.

1457
01:31:30,751 --> 01:31:32,626
Every minute of her daughter's life.

1458
01:31:32,834 --> 01:31:34,167
In a magical moment.

1459
01:31:34,376 --> 01:31:36,084
In my opinion,

1460
01:31:36,917 --> 01:31:38,917
magic is cruelly
lacking in modern live.

1461
01:31:39,126 --> 01:31:40,209
Amen.

1462
01:31:41,959 --> 01:31:43,417
The question is:

1463
01:31:43,626 --> 01:31:47,584
"How many days did Gloria
go to school last month?"

1464
01:31:54,501 --> 01:31:55,501
Five.

1465
01:31:58,334 --> 01:31:59,376
Or six.

1466
01:31:59,584 --> 01:32:01,251
Six, that's good.

1467
01:32:01,459 --> 01:32:02,834
Six, definitely.

1468
01:32:03,542 --> 01:32:05,084
Very well thank you.

1469
01:32:06,227 --> 01:32:07,227
Next.

1470
01:32:07,251 --> 01:32:08,792
Mr. Abelli.

1471
01:32:18,876 --> 01:32:19,876
Sir.

1472
01:32:24,334 --> 01:32:27,084
Gloria has arrived
in my life overnight.

1473
01:32:30,126 --> 01:32:31,542
I was not ready.

1474
01:32:32,459 --> 01:32:35,042
But I did the best I could.

1475
01:32:36,126 --> 01:32:38,042
Maybe I have not quite high enough,

1476
01:32:38,251 --> 01:32:41,334
maybe my love is too
strong, too loud.

1477
01:32:42,167 --> 01:32:44,417
But I can not do otherwise.

1478
01:32:44,626 --> 01:32:46,001
The question is...

1479
01:32:46,209 --> 01:32:48,376
I'm not done.
No "the question is."

1480
01:32:49,501 --> 01:32:51,667
Forgive me if I do not know the laws.

1481
01:32:51,876 --> 01:32:53,876
I'm not a super father.

1482
01:32:54,084 --> 01:32:56,251
But I'm fighting for
my daughter to live.

1483
01:32:56,459 --> 01:32:59,251
In a world where all
children dream.

1484
01:32:59,834 --> 01:33:01,751
I can change my job,

1485
01:33:01,959 --> 01:33:05,209
I can make sure she does
not miss a school day.

1486
01:33:05,417 --> 01:33:08,167
I can even learn
English, if you will,

1487
01:33:09,459 --> 01:33:11,209
but I implore you,

1488
01:33:12,959 --> 01:33:14,459
do not take my daughter away.

1489
01:33:15,626 --> 01:33:17,459
Do not tear my heart away.

1490
01:33:19,501 --> 01:33:21,001
Do not do that.

1491
01:33:29,084 --> 01:33:30,417
That's all.

1492
01:33:35,584 --> 01:33:37,542
The question is:

1493
01:33:38,292 --> 01:33:41,334
"What is the child best interest?"

1494
01:33:41,542 --> 01:33:43,751
That is the solely
question we are asking.

1495
01:33:43,959 --> 01:33:46,042
The solely we have to answer.

1496
01:33:46,251 --> 01:33:48,126
Before you today.

1497
01:33:48,876 --> 01:33:50,376
Following the conscience,

1498
01:33:50,584 --> 01:33:52,917
we unanimously decided.

1499
01:33:53,917 --> 01:33:57,251
That the custody of
Gloria should return...

1500
01:34:01,501 --> 01:34:03,084
To the parent she knows best.

1501
01:34:05,376 --> 01:34:08,501
We give you custody of
your daughter, sir.

1502
01:34:09,209 --> 01:34:10,501
- Yes!
- Thank you.

1503
01:34:12,334 --> 01:34:13,334
Provided that...

1504
01:34:14,126 --> 01:34:16,459
That you take English classes.

1505
01:34:16,667 --> 01:34:17,709
Yes.

1506
01:34:17,917 --> 01:34:20,584
"That you cease to be a stuntman."

1507
01:34:20,792 --> 01:34:22,251
- We do not care.
- Yes.

1508
01:34:22,459 --> 01:34:24,376
And that Gloria goes to school.

1509
01:34:28,376 --> 01:34:30,584
The meeting adjourned.

1510
01:34:30,792 --> 01:34:32,084
Thank you everyone.

1511
01:34:36,167 --> 01:34:37,167
Mr. Abelli.

1512
01:34:39,792 --> 01:34:41,376
Be worthy of this judgment.

1513
01:34:41,584 --> 01:34:42,917
Ok. Ok.

1514
01:34:43,126 --> 01:34:44,751
Hard, but fair.

1515
01:34:59,917 --> 01:35:03,584
One year has 12
months, 365 days,

1516
01:35:03,792 --> 01:35:05,417
and especially 4 seasons.

1517
01:35:05,626 --> 01:35:06,792
Very distinct...

1518
01:35:07,001 --> 01:35:08,459
Someone's knocking at the door.

1519
01:35:09,667 --> 01:35:11,251
"Mademoiselle."

1520
01:35:12,751 --> 01:35:14,667
Children, sit down.

1521
01:35:15,667 --> 01:35:17,251
Some know it,

1522
01:35:17,459 --> 01:35:21,501
but I present Samuel, your
new general superintendent.

1523
01:35:21,709 --> 01:35:23,709
- Hello.
- Hello sir.

1524
01:35:27,376 --> 01:35:28,876
Hello madam.

1525
01:35:29,084 --> 01:35:31,251
The father of...
It's before all.

1526
01:35:31,459 --> 01:35:33,917
A new member of our institution.

1527
01:35:34,126 --> 01:35:36,126
The staff must therefore accommodate it.

1528
01:35:36,334 --> 01:35:38,084
"Do not worry, madam,
I'll make you forget."

1529
01:35:38,292 --> 01:35:41,376
I do not think it's
a good idea to...

1530
01:35:41,584 --> 01:35:43,251
Come and think in my office.

1531
01:35:43,459 --> 01:35:46,042
I will explain to
you in private.

1532
01:35:46,251 --> 01:35:48,251
Who will take care of my students?

1533
01:35:48,459 --> 01:35:50,501
The new general supervisor.

1534
01:35:53,251 --> 01:35:54,417
Are you okay, guys?

1535
01:35:57,376 --> 01:35:58,709
You were on what?

1536
01:35:59,251 --> 01:36:00,626
The four seasons.

1537
01:36:00,834 --> 01:36:04,126
It's not complicated:
Winter, it's cold.

1538
01:36:04,167 --> 01:36:05,917
Christmas trees, Christmas dad, snow...

1539
01:36:06,126 --> 01:36:08,917
And there's summer too.
It's hot.

1540
01:36:09,126 --> 01:36:12,167
The sun, the palm trees,
the orangeades...

1541
01:36:14,001 --> 01:36:15,334
They do not care.

1542
01:36:15,959 --> 01:36:16,959
Good!

1543
01:36:17,042 --> 01:36:18,667
What is the four seasons?

1544
01:36:18,876 --> 01:36:19,876
It's Vivaldi.

1545
01:36:19,959 --> 01:36:21,709
Vivaldi, great musician.

1546
01:36:21,917 --> 01:36:24,917
Hair cut questionable, but
composer unavoidable.

1547
01:36:25,126 --> 01:36:28,542
So we, it is normal, in
tribute to the good man,

1548
01:36:28,751 --> 01:36:30,584
you, you keep this cup,

1549
01:36:30,792 --> 01:36:32,167
it will make him happy,

1550
01:36:32,376 --> 01:36:35,667
and we play music.
You have instruments?

1551
01:36:39,792 --> 01:36:40,917
Yes yes yes!

1552
01:36:41,126 --> 01:36:42,709
Congratulations! 20 out of 20 direct.

1553
01:36:42,917 --> 01:36:43,917
Who wants 20 out of 20?

1554
01:36:44,001 --> 01:36:45,584
'Me!

1555
01:36:49,626 --> 01:36:51,792
It's the big brother!
I love this job!

1556
01:36:55,501 --> 01:36:56,501
Hello?

1557
01:36:56,709 --> 01:36:59,667
I can not talk to you,
I'm history.

1558
01:36:59,876 --> 01:37:01,751
Samuel, we have a problem...

1559
01:37:01,959 --> 01:37:03,626
What is happening?

1560
01:37:03,834 --> 01:37:09,084
"Listen, miss Stuart asked
for a paternity test."

1561
01:37:09,292 --> 01:37:10,292
What?

1562
01:37:10,959 --> 01:37:12,459
I'm sorry.

1563
01:37:53,417 --> 01:37:55,501
"I'm sorry, sir."

1564
01:38:18,376 --> 01:38:19,626
I 'll be back.

1565
01:38:35,667 --> 01:38:36,751
Kristin!

1566
01:38:40,251 --> 01:38:41,709
- Come.
- It's okay.

1567
01:38:47,001 --> 01:38:48,376
Just tell me.

1568
01:38:49,876 --> 01:38:52,334
Did you know it from the beginning?
No.

1569
01:38:55,459 --> 01:38:57,667
I was convinced it was you.

1570
01:39:04,376 --> 01:39:05,834
I'm sorry.

1571
01:39:28,334 --> 01:39:31,751
"What does mean" organic "?

1572
01:39:33,834 --> 01:39:37,626
"That means the little
seed is not mine."

1573
01:39:38,251 --> 01:39:40,917
- But you're still my daddy?
- Of course.

1574
01:39:42,584 --> 01:39:45,167
You have a dad who designed you
and a dad who brought you up.

1575
01:39:47,042 --> 01:39:49,667
- All that is just words.
- Exactly.

1576
01:39:49,876 --> 01:39:52,001
It's just words, my daughter.

1577
01:40:03,667 --> 01:40:05,417
Good morning. "Sir."

1578
01:40:06,292 --> 01:40:08,126
Is that obligatory, Scotland yard?

1579
01:40:08,334 --> 01:40:10,584
I did not want to.
This is the procedure.

1580
01:40:14,209 --> 01:40:15,209
You are ready?

1581
01:40:18,584 --> 01:40:19,751
You leave me 2 m?

1582
01:40:25,917 --> 01:40:28,317
Goodbye, that does not mean we'll
never see each other again.

1583
01:40:29,376 --> 01:40:30,376
Hey?

1584
01:40:30,584 --> 01:40:31,709
Yes I know.

1585
01:40:33,792 --> 01:40:35,001
Dad...

1586
01:40:35,959 --> 01:40:37,459
My love.

1587
01:40:37,667 --> 01:40:39,417
Do not worry, it's okay.

1588
01:40:40,626 --> 01:40:42,626
And then you'll love New York.

1589
01:40:42,834 --> 01:40:46,126
You never took a plane!
It's going to be crazy. Hey?

1590
01:40:46,334 --> 01:40:47,667
Sir?

1591
01:40:47,876 --> 01:40:48,876
Come on.

1592
01:40:49,584 --> 01:40:50,792
Let's go!

1593
01:40:51,251 --> 01:40:54,334
Put that. We're expected, come on.

1594
01:40:59,959 --> 01:41:01,834
You know what? We'll make a game.

1595
01:41:02,042 --> 01:41:03,917
You're going to run down.

1596
01:41:04,126 --> 01:41:06,334
If you're down before
I'm at the window,

1597
01:41:06,542 --> 01:41:07,542
you won.

1598
01:41:07,626 --> 01:41:09,334
- Ok?
- Ok.

1599
01:41:10,417 --> 01:41:11,417
Ready?

1600
01:41:12,751 --> 01:41:13,751
1...

1601
01:41:15,042 --> 01:41:16,042
2...

1602
01:41:16,834 --> 01:41:17,834
3!

1603
01:41:25,376 --> 01:41:26,959
I'm sorry, Samuel.

1604
01:41:29,209 --> 01:41:30,959
It could have happened otherwise.

1605
01:41:31,792 --> 01:41:33,292
That should have been.

1606
01:42:08,292 --> 01:42:09,834
I won.

1607
01:42:38,126 --> 01:42:39,626
Hi, Bernie.

1608
01:42:54,292 --> 01:42:55,834
We're going.

1609
01:43:13,709 --> 01:43:16,459
"Is this the first time
you've been on a plane?"

1610
01:43:16,667 --> 01:43:17,667
Yeah.

1611
01:43:17,751 --> 01:43:20,417
- You'll see, it's a great journey.
- Hum.

1612
01:43:20,626 --> 01:43:21,917
"Where up to miss?"

1613
01:43:22,126 --> 01:43:24,417
Heathrow, terminal 3.

1614
01:43:31,001 --> 01:43:32,167
Wait!

1615
01:43:36,459 --> 01:43:38,251
What's the matter?

1616
01:43:38,459 --> 01:43:41,167
I gotta go back, I
forgot something.

1617
01:43:41,959 --> 01:43:42,959
You're sure?

1618
01:43:43,167 --> 01:43:46,542
- Yeah, that's super important.
- Ok.

1619
01:43:46,751 --> 01:43:47,917
Hurry up.

1620
01:43:48,126 --> 01:43:49,126
Yeah.

1621
01:44:03,251 --> 01:44:04,917
What are you doing here?

1622
01:44:05,792 --> 01:44:08,459
I told mom I had
forgotten something.

1623
01:44:09,042 --> 01:44:12,126
But in truth, I do
not want to leave.

1624
01:44:14,376 --> 01:44:15,876
You lied to her?

1625
01:44:16,792 --> 01:44:19,751
Ben... for the good of people,
we have the right, right?

1626
01:44:23,251 --> 01:44:26,126
I want everyone to
live the whole life.

1627
01:44:34,042 --> 01:44:35,751
We're gonna miss the plane.

1628
01:44:42,417 --> 01:44:43,501
Sat! Open it!

1629
01:44:43,709 --> 01:44:45,376
Open the door, please.

1630
01:44:47,876 --> 01:44:49,042
Sam.

1631
01:44:59,751 --> 01:45:02,292
"But where are we going?"
No idea!

1632
01:45:10,792 --> 01:45:11,959
Over there!

1633
01:45:14,376 --> 01:45:16,334
"Where are they, Bernie?"

1634
01:45:18,126 --> 01:45:21,417
Fuck, Samuel...
If you know, tell him.

1635
01:45:21,626 --> 01:45:23,126
- I dunno!
- The judge decided.

1636
01:45:23,334 --> 01:45:24,501
It's an abduction!

1637
01:45:24,709 --> 01:45:26,626
No. It's not an abduction!

1638
01:45:27,209 --> 01:45:29,642
Are you going to report the
disappearance of their daughter?

1639
01:45:32,142 --> 01:45:33,792
Tell me the truth.

1640
01:45:35,709 --> 01:45:38,209
He makes a bullshit!
It's irresponsible!

1641
01:45:38,417 --> 01:45:39,542
Stop saying that!

1642
01:45:41,376 --> 01:45:43,084
This "irresponsible" guy,

1643
01:45:43,292 --> 01:45:45,459
it's been four years since every day,

1644
01:45:45,667 --> 01:45:49,459
he fears that this is the last time
he will see his daughter smile.

1645
01:45:54,334 --> 01:45:56,084
That is the truth.

1646
01:45:59,126 --> 01:46:01,126
What does it mean?

1647
01:46:04,626 --> 01:46:06,292
She is sick.

1648
01:46:08,876 --> 01:46:10,126
What?

1649
01:46:12,417 --> 01:46:14,417
You know nothing.

1650
01:46:32,626 --> 01:46:34,584
- Over there!
- There's nothing!

1651
01:46:34,792 --> 01:46:38,167
"Yes, we're going to jump as on
the cliff when you were little!"

1652
01:46:38,376 --> 01:46:39,834
"Truly, I've never jumped!"

1653
01:46:40,042 --> 01:46:42,917
Not serious! You're immortal!
Trust me.

1654
01:46:43,126 --> 01:46:44,251
Hold on! No!

1655
01:47:09,292 --> 01:47:12,584
Did you know this thing?
"Of course!"

1656
01:47:20,334 --> 01:47:22,667
I know where I'm going to take you.

1657
01:48:02,542 --> 01:48:03,584
Here.

1658
01:48:04,667 --> 01:48:06,667
It was here that I did not jump.

1659
01:48:08,584 --> 01:48:09,626
Okay.

1660
01:48:12,292 --> 01:48:13,584
We can skip today.

1661
01:48:14,292 --> 01:48:16,959
No. We're going to start from scratch.
If you start.

1662
01:48:17,167 --> 01:48:20,084
To say stuff like that!
Lets' go.

1663
01:48:26,709 --> 01:48:30,917
There are more difficult tests than
jumping from the top of a cliff.

1664
01:48:35,084 --> 01:48:36,709
When Gloria entered my life,

1665
01:48:36,917 --> 01:48:39,959
I found the courage to throw
myself into the void.

1666
01:48:51,501 --> 01:48:54,501
She taught me that fear
of dying is nothing.

1667
01:48:54,709 --> 01:48:56,251
Alongside that are not living.

1668
01:49:00,001 --> 01:49:03,459
That a 20 euro ticket to pay
for a taxi could be the key.

1669
01:49:03,667 --> 01:49:05,917
Of absolute happiness.

1670
01:49:06,126 --> 01:49:14,126
A.

1671
01:49:30,584 --> 01:49:33,292
There is no perfect
mother or ideal father.

1672
01:49:33,501 --> 01:49:34,917
One does what one can.

1673
01:49:35,709 --> 01:49:36,709
We improvise.

1674
01:49:41,001 --> 01:49:43,417
Today, I just need
to look at Gloria,

1675
01:49:43,626 --> 01:49:46,042
to hear her laugh,
to forget all the rest.

1676
01:49:49,792 --> 01:49:51,792
Only count that moment.

1677
01:49:52,834 --> 01:49:55,334
And that little music
that will never leave me.

1678
01:50:00,751 --> 01:50:02,209
It was worth it.

1679
01:50:08,209 --> 01:50:11,334
Even when life reserves
you a setback,

1680
01:50:11,542 --> 01:50:13,417
a defect in the machine,

1681
01:50:14,667 --> 01:50:16,001
a weakness,

1682
01:50:17,126 --> 01:50:18,292
just here,

1683
01:50:18,501 --> 01:50:21,417
close to the heart,
and that the doctors explain to us.

1684
01:50:21,626 --> 01:50:24,084
That there is no explanation.

1685
01:50:24,292 --> 01:50:25,292
It's like that.

1686
01:50:25,501 --> 01:50:26,751
It's life.

1687
01:50:28,959 --> 01:50:32,959
That one day,
Gloria will fall asleep and never wake up.

1688
01:50:37,334 --> 01:50:40,042
The doctors had not been mistaken.

1689
01:50:40,251 --> 01:50:43,584
Gloria left a few weeks after she passed,

1690
01:50:43,792 --> 01:50:46,376
the most beautiful moments
of her family life.

1691
01:51:05,334 --> 01:51:08,001
My father prepared me
to face my fears,

1692
01:51:08,209 --> 01:51:10,126
and my daughter, to face life.

1693
01:51:12,834 --> 01:51:16,209
There are sometimes
falls that never stop,

1694
01:51:16,417 --> 01:51:20,584
but I wanted every second of this fall
to be a feast.

1695
01:51:20,792 --> 01:51:25,209
And today I have engraved in each
of these seconds with my daughter.

1696
01:51:27,667 --> 01:51:30,542
Gloria is there, near me.

1697
01:51:30,751 --> 01:51:33,417
Every moment. Forever.

1698
01:51:36,251 --> 01:51:37,584
And tomorrow
