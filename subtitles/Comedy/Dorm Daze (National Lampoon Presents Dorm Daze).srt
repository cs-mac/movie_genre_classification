1
00:03:14,077 --> 00:03:19,077
That was beautiful--

2
00:03:30,327 --> 00:03:34,697
Take it. Russ.

3
00:03:34,698 --> 00:03:37,533
Dad. can you explain again
what we're doing?

4
00:03:37,534 --> 00:03:41,370
Sure. Russ. We're kicking off our fun.
old-fashioned family Christmas...

5
00:03:41,371 --> 00:03:45,074
...by heading out into the country
in the old front-wheel drive sleigh...

6
00:03:45,075 --> 00:03:47,743
...to embrace the frosty majesty
of the winter landscape...

7
00:03:47,744 --> 00:03:51,013
...and select that most important
of Christmas symbols.

8
00:03:51,014 --> 00:03:55,217
We're not driving all the way out here
so you can get one of those stupid ties...

9
00:03:55,218 --> 00:03:59,555
-...with the Santa Clauses on it, are we?
- No. I have one of those at home.

10
00:03:59,556 --> 00:04:04,556
What we're looking for today
is the Griswold family Christmas tree.

11
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:18,670
- What's the matter?
- Some jackass is riding my tail.

12
00:04:19,476 --> 00:04:24,476
Slow down and let him pass.

13
00:04:33,457 --> 00:04:37,393
Clark! Don't provoke them.

14
00:04:37,394 --> 00:04:42,394
Hey. kids. look a deer.

15
00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:02,084
Clark. slow down!

16
00:05:02,085 --> 00:05:04,787
You wanna ride behind somebody
who does that?

17
00:05:04,788 --> 00:05:07,289
I'll pull around them
and leave them behind us.

18
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:11,160
Burn some dust here. Eat my rubber.

19
00:05:11,161 --> 00:05:15,297
Dad. I think what you mean is.
“Burn rubber." and. “Eat my dust.“

20
00:05:15,298 --> 00:05:20,298
Whatever. Russ. Whatever.

21
00:05:22,172 --> 00:05:27,172
Eat my road grit. liver lips!

22
00:05:28,311 --> 00:05:33,311
Okay. That's enough of that.

23
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:37,987
Speaking of Christmas trees. kids.
can one of you tell me...

24
00:05:37,988 --> 00:05:40,723
...what the first tree displayed
at the White House was?

25
00:05:40,724 --> 00:05:45,724
Dad. they're back.

26
00:05:46,963 --> 00:05:51,267
Clark. stop it!
I don't want to spend the holidays dead.

27
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:54,770
Honey. please! I'll do the driving. okay?

28
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:59,575
Will you just take it easy. Ellen?
I'm in complete control.

29
00:05:59,576 --> 00:06:04,576
I'll get around this egg timer.

30
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:10,949
Dad. Dad.

31
00:06:18,395 --> 00:06:22,631
- We're all right! Thank God. we're all right!
- Clark. we're stuck under a truck!

32
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:26,535
- Do you honestly think I don't know that?
- Come on. you guys. don't fight.

33
00:06:26,536 --> 00:06:31,536
For chrissake.
I didn't do this on purpose!

34
00:06:32,609 --> 00:06:37,112
Our Father. who art in heaven.
hallowed be thy name.

35
00:06:37,113 --> 00:06:40,182
And forgive my husband.
He knows not what he does.

36
00:06:40,183 --> 00:06:43,586
Amen!

37
00:06:43,587 --> 00:06:48,587
Oh. my God! Oh. my God! Oh. my God!

38
00:06:59,869 --> 00:07:04,869
Made pretty good time.

39
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:12,481
Dad. didn't they invent Christmas tree lots
so people wouldn't have to drive...

40
00:07:12,482 --> 00:07:15,684
...all the way out to nowhere
and waste a whole Saturday?

41
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:20,122
They invented them because people forgot
how to have an old-fashioned Christmas...

42
00:07:20,123 --> 00:07:22,658
...and are satisfied with scrawny.
overpriced trees...

43
00:07:22,659 --> 00:07:25,527
-...that have no special meaning.
- My toes are numb.

44
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:29,632
- Kids. this is what our forefathers did.
- I can't feel my leg.

45
00:07:29,633 --> 00:07:33,535
They walked out into the woods, picked out
the tree and cut it with their hands.

46
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:36,505
- Mom. I can't feel my hips.
- Clark.

47
00:07:36,506 --> 00:07:39,575
- Yes. honey?
- Audrey's frozen from the waist down.

48
00:07:39,576 --> 00:07:43,979
That's all part of the experience. honey.

49
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:48,980
There it is.

50
00:08:04,167 --> 00:08:09,167
The Griswold family Christmas tree.

51
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:17,880
- Isn't it a little big?
- It's not big. it's just full.

52
00:08:17,881 --> 00:08:22,881
- Dad. that thing wouldn't fit in our yard.
- It's not going in our yard. Russ.

53
00:08:23,053 --> 00:08:28,053
It's going in our living room.

54
00:08:29,893 --> 00:08:32,995
- Look at it.
- It really is beautiful. Clark.

55
00:08:32,996 --> 00:08:35,664
- It's something else. huh. Russ?
- Yeah. Dad.

56
00:08:35,665 --> 00:08:38,867
- Isn't it a beaut. Audrey?
- She'll see it later. honey.

57
00:08:38,868 --> 00:08:41,103
Her eyes are frozen.

58
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:44,873
Most enduring traditions of the season
are best enjoyed in the warm embrace...

59
00:08:44,874 --> 00:08:48,377
...of kith and kin.

60
00:08:48,378 --> 00:08:53,182
This tree is the symbol of the spirit
of the Griswold family Christmas.

61
00:08:53,183 --> 00:08:58,183
Dad. did you bring a saw?

62
00:09:40,964 --> 00:09:45,964
Looks like the toad overestimated
the height of his living room ceiling.

63
00:09:56,246 --> 00:10:01,246
Hey. Griswold. Where do you think
you're gonna put a tree that big?

64
00:10:01,985 --> 00:10:04,787
Bend over and I'll show you.

65
00:10:04,788 --> 00:10:07,322
You've got a lot of nerve
talking to me like that.

66
00:10:07,323 --> 00:10:12,323
I wasn't talking to you.

67
00:10:23,807 --> 00:10:28,807
Clark. do you think there's enough room
for the angel?

68
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:32,114
Oh. sure. honey. I have
a little more trimming to do...

69
00:10:32,115 --> 00:10:34,950
...but that won't be a problem.
Ready?

70
00:10:34,951 --> 00:10:39,951
I give you
the Griswold family Christmas tree.

71
00:10:46,496 --> 00:10:50,365
There's a lot of sap in here.

72
00:10:50,366 --> 00:10:55,366
It looks great. A little full. A lot of sap.

73
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:18,961
- Did I tell you I talked to my mother today?
- And?

74
00:11:18,962 --> 00:11:22,898
They've decided they're coming
for Christmas too.

75
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:27,899
- It's not too late to change our plans.
- No. no. that's great. That's great.

76
00:11:28,538 --> 00:11:30,739
You're forgetting how difficult
it's gonna be...

77
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:33,075
...having everybody in the house
at the same time.

78
00:11:33,076 --> 00:11:36,078
Honey. they're family.
They're not strangers off the street.

79
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:40,716
- All they do is argue.
- Christmas is about resolving differences...

80
00:11:40,717 --> 00:11:43,118
...and seeing through the problems
of family life.

81
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:47,689
Yeah. And it's about my mother accusing
your mother of buying cheap hot dogs.

82
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:51,860
And your mother accusing my mother
of waxing her upper lip.

83
00:11:51,861 --> 00:11:55,464
- And then they don't speak to each other--
- Your mother waxes her upper lip?

84
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:59,868
- She has for years.
- It doesn't show.

85
00:11:59,869 --> 00:12:03,038
- I don't know. Sparky. I have this feeling--
- Ellen.

86
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:05,874
I want to have Christmas
here in our house.

87
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:10,279
It means a lot to me. All my life
I've wanted to have a big family Christmas.

88
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:14,283
I know.

89
00:12:14,284 --> 00:12:19,284
It's just that I know how you build
things up in your mind. Sparky.

90
00:12:19,422 --> 00:12:24,326
You set standards that no family event
can ever live up to.

91
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:29,327
When have I ever done that?

92
00:12:29,565 --> 00:12:34,565
- Parties. Weddings. Anniversaries.
- Good night, honey.

93
00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:40,442
- Funerals. Holidays.
- Oh. great.

94
00:12:40,443 --> 00:12:45,443
Vacations. Graduations.

95
00:13:06,135 --> 00:13:09,204
You should be looking at
a fat Christmas bonus this year. huh?

96
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:14,205
Word is you're an excellent choice to be
named Food Additive Designer of the Year.

97
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:15,944
I'm not kidding.

98
00:13:15,945 --> 00:13:18,280
What's that new thing you got
at Food and Drug?

99
00:13:18,281 --> 00:13:22,150
Oh. the crunch enhancer?
Yeah. it's a non-nutritive cereal varnish.

100
00:13:22,151 --> 00:13:25,320
It's semipermeable. not osmatic.
It coats and seals the flake...

101
00:13:25,321 --> 00:13:27,956
-...prevents the milk from penetrating it.
- Yeah.

102
00:13:27,957 --> 00:13:30,425
- It's a beautiful product.
- I like it. yeah.

103
00:13:30,426 --> 00:13:32,928
The question is.
what will you do with that bonus?

104
00:13:32,929 --> 00:13:36,732
- Gonna blow it on yourself. I hope.
- Me? Heck. no.

105
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:41,733
Take a look at this.

106
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,140
I hope my Christmas bonus check
will cover it.

107
00:13:45,141 --> 00:13:50,141
Oh. my God. you're putting in a pool.

108
00:13:57,787 --> 00:14:01,256
I went ahead and I put a $7500
deposit down on it.

109
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:05,093
You're the last true family man.

110
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:09,698
- Mark.
- Clark.

111
00:14:09,699 --> 00:14:11,266
That's Bill. sir.

112
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:14,436
Were you working on that
non-nutritive cereal varnish?

113
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:17,339
- Yes. sir.
- I've got to give a speech to a trade group.

114
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:22,110
I'd like to mention it. Write a brief summary
and have it to me by the end of the day.

115
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,079
- My pleasure.
- Layman's terms.

116
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,916
None of that inside bullshit jargon
nobody understands.

117
00:14:27,917 --> 00:14:32,421
Yes. sir.

118
00:14:32,422 --> 00:14:35,991
Oh. Mr. Shirley. We got
your Christmas card the other day...

119
00:14:35,992 --> 00:14:40,328
...and my family and I are very flattered
that you remembered us.

120
00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:45,329
Corporate cards.

121
00:14:45,935 --> 00:14:49,404
- Don't forget that report. Bill.
- Yes. sir. Thank you. Merry Christmas.

122
00:14:49,405 --> 00:14:51,873
Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

123
00:14:51,874 --> 00:14:56,874
Kiss my ass. Kiss his ass. Kiss your ass.
Happy Hanukkah.

124
00:15:22,872 --> 00:15:27,872
Can I show you something?

125
00:15:31,714 --> 00:15:36,714
I was just smelling-- Smiling.
I was just blouse-- Browsing.

126
00:15:38,421 --> 00:15:42,591
For your wife or your girlfriend?

127
00:15:42,592 --> 00:15:47,592
What? What happened?

128
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:54,436
I guess it wouldn't be any--

129
00:15:54,437 --> 00:15:57,439
Wouldn't be the Christmas shopping
season if stores were less hooter--

130
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,909
Hotter than they are.

131
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:03,044
- It is warm in here.
- You have your coat on.

132
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:06,348
- Yes. Oh. do I? How did that happen?
- Because it's cold out.

133
00:16:06,349 --> 00:16:11,349
Yes. Yes. It is. It's a bit nipply out.
I mean. nippy out.

134
00:16:11,954 --> 00:16:14,623
What did I say. nipple?

135
00:16:14,624 --> 00:16:19,624
- There is a nip in the air though.
- Can I take something out for you?

136
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:33,275
I was just... I was just looking
at something for my wife.

137
00:16:33,276 --> 00:16:36,545
- God rest her soul.
- Oh. God. I'm so sorry.

138
00:16:36,546 --> 00:16:41,546
Oh. no. no. she's not dead.
We're just divorced. She's history.

139
00:16:42,385 --> 00:16:46,388
Obviously she doesn't wear underwear.
And there are plenty of shopping days left...

140
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:51,226
...until adultery“ Adulthood.
Which is to say Christmas. as in Yule.

141
00:16:51,227 --> 00:16:56,227
Yule log. Not a log. I don't have a log.
But. I mean. you know. just if I had a log...

142
00:16:56,232 --> 00:17:01,232
...not in the sense that you think
I said I did. Good golly.

143
00:17:02,505 --> 00:17:04,673
<i>"Us the season to be merry.</i>

144
00:17:04,674 --> 00:17:09,674
- Well. that's my name.
- No shit.

145
00:17:15,551 --> 00:17:20,422
What do these do? Do they clip on here?
Down there?

146
00:17:20,423 --> 00:17:23,124
- Would you like this one?
- Sure.

147
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:27,062
These are cut really high on the hip.
Look. I'm wearing something similar.

148
00:17:27,063 --> 00:17:29,097
See? You can't see the line.

149
00:17:29,098 --> 00:17:31,766
- You can't see the line. can you. Russ?
- No.

150
00:17:31,767 --> 00:17:35,036
No.

151
00:17:35,037 --> 00:17:39,474
<i>That's a Christmas present
from a very dear friend of mine.</i>

152
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:43,545
<i>Look, Daddy, teacher says
every time a bell rings...</i>

153
00:17:43,546 --> 00:17:48,546
<i>...an angel gets his wings.</i>

154
00:18:19,749 --> 00:18:24,749
Folks! Folks! Folks! Merry Christmas.

155
00:18:25,254 --> 00:18:29,557
- Hey! How you doing. son?
- Fine.

156
00:18:29,558 --> 00:18:33,128
There he is! Oh. my boy.

157
00:18:33,129 --> 00:18:37,332
- Look at how big you've gotten.
- Merry Christmas.

158
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,067
- Mom.
- Sweetheart.

159
00:18:39,068 --> 00:18:43,405
Oh. knock on the door.
Lift up the ladder.

160
00:18:43,406 --> 00:18:45,874
- Listen. Doesn't Nora look old?
- You promised.

161
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:49,344
- Of course I do.
- They took a pint of fluid out of my back.

162
00:18:49,345 --> 00:18:51,646
Do you see this mole?
This mole on my neck?

163
00:18:51,647 --> 00:18:53,315
- Think it's changing color?
- No.

164
00:18:53,316 --> 00:18:57,652
- You keep touching it. it's getting redder.
- I got hemorrhoids. Can you believe that?

165
00:18:57,653 --> 00:18:59,854
- Oh. Mother.
-Isn't that terrible?

166
00:18:59,855 --> 00:19:02,524
- You're not getting the garage space.
- After what you did--

167
00:19:02,525 --> 00:19:04,592
I'm doing the parking.
Russ. you want to help?

168
00:19:04,593 --> 00:19:07,829
Mom. they're not sleeping in my room.
I'm gonna go crazy. Mom.

169
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:11,266
Sweetheart. Your grandma Nora's
got a real painful burr on my heel.

170
00:19:11,267 --> 00:19:13,768
If you rub it for me.
I'll give you a whole quarter.

171
00:19:13,769 --> 00:19:16,705
- A quarter. A quarter.
- I'll give Audrey a quarter too.

172
00:19:16,706 --> 00:19:20,241
- I'm gonna put my car in the garage!
- He damaged my car, you believe that?

173
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,677
I'll park the cars.

174
00:19:22,678 --> 00:19:25,880
This is what Christmas is all about.

175
00:19:25,881 --> 00:19:29,718
I'll park the cars
and check the luggage...

176
00:19:29,719 --> 00:19:34,719
...and yeah. I'll be outside for the season.

177
00:19:36,392 --> 00:19:38,927
We're gonna have the best-looking house
in town.

178
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:42,597
- I've always wanted to do this.
- That's a lot of lights. Dad.

179
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,700
I'm sure it's a lot of work too.
but if I'm out in the cold...

180
00:19:45,701 --> 00:19:49,003
...and I'm committed to decorating
the house. I'm gonna do it right...

181
00:19:49,004 --> 00:19:51,740
...and I'm gonna do it big.

182
00:19:51,741 --> 00:19:54,542
You want something you can be proud of.
don't you?

183
00:19:54,543 --> 00:19:58,213
- Yeah. I guess so.
- Sure you do.

184
00:19:58,214 --> 00:20:03,214
- You think you might be overdoing it. Dad?
- When was the last time I overdid anything?

185
00:20:07,323 --> 00:20:10,558
Come on. unravel these.

186
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:15,559
You have to check every bulb.
Got a little knot here. You work on that.

187
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:22,133
I'll get the other box.

188
00:20:32,047 --> 00:20:34,883
- I hope he falls and breaks his neck.
- I'm sure he'll fall.

189
00:20:34,884 --> 00:20:39,884
But I don't think we're lucky enough
to have him break his neck.

190
00:20:41,023 --> 00:20:46,023
Let's go.

191
00:21:09,785 --> 00:21:14,722
<i>Bov. these gusty winds appear to be playing
havoc with that giant nutcracker float.</i>

192
00:21:14,723 --> 00:21:19,127
<i>At this point I can't even see the nuts.
They must have blown away.</i>

193
00:21:19,128 --> 00:21:23,431
<i>But nothing is going to dampen the spirit
of this holiday crowd, I can tell you that.</i>

194
00:21:23,432 --> 00:21:27,836
<i>Oh, here they are. Here come the nuts.
These look like giant nuts to me.</i>

195
00:21:27,837 --> 00:21:31,539
<i>Yeah, I'm reminded of a couple years ago,
the winds were so high here...</i>

196
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,142
<i>...we almost lost Santa's reindeer.</i>

197
00:21:34,143 --> 00:21:39,143
<i>Rudolph's red nose took out a third floor
window at Marshal! Field's.</i>

198
00:21:39,148 --> 00:21:44,148
<i>They better keep their eyes out
on their nuts before someone gets hurt.</i>

199
00:22:43,078 --> 00:22:46,548
Would it be indecent to ask
the grandparents to stay at a hotel?

200
00:22:46,549 --> 00:22:48,182
Audrey.

201
00:22:48,183 --> 00:22:51,052
Well. can we at least forbid them
to answer the phone?

202
00:22:51,053 --> 00:22:55,123
Alex called this morning. Grandpa Clark
told him I couldn't come to the phone...

203
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:59,627
-...because I was going to the bathroom.
- We're all making sacrifices. Audrey.

204
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:01,963
Everybody? Do you sleep with your brother?

205
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:04,666
Do you know how sick and twisted
that is. Mom?

206
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:09,504
Well. I'm sleeping with your father.
Don't be so dramatic.

207
00:23:09,505 --> 00:23:11,940
I have nightmares about
what he does in his bed...

208
00:23:11,941 --> 00:23:14,008
...when I'm not lying right next to him.

209
00:23:14,009 --> 00:23:19,009
Well. I don't know what to say except
it's Christmas and we're all in misery.

210
00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:23,918
Ellen. are you smoking again?

211
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,919
No!

212
00:23:36,532 --> 00:23:39,334
Hey. Dad. where do you want
these reindeer?

213
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:43,905
Just put them down there on the lawn.
Russ.

214
00:23:43,906 --> 00:23:47,141
I can't find the Santa Claus.

215
00:23:47,142 --> 00:23:52,142
It's in the basement. We'll get it later.

216
00:24:45,968 --> 00:24:50,968
- Clark. Dinner's ready.
- Okay. honey. I'm starving.

217
00:25:10,526 --> 00:25:12,860
Obviously something
had to break the window!

218
00:25:12,861 --> 00:25:17,861
Something had to hit the stereo!

219
00:25:24,673 --> 00:25:29,673
- And why is the carpet all wet. Todd?
- I don't know. Margo.

220
00:25:37,886 --> 00:25:41,055
You want to hurry this up. Clark?
I'm freezing my baguettes off.

221
00:25:41,056 --> 00:25:45,827
Two hundred and fifty strands of light.
100 individual bulbs per strand...

222
00:25:45,828 --> 00:25:50,828
...for a grand total of 25.000
imported Italian twinkle lights.

223
00:25:51,867 --> 00:25:55,103
- Twenty-five thousand.
- Well. I hope nobody I know drives by...

224
00:25:55,104 --> 00:25:59,140
...and sees me standing in the yard.
staring at the house in my pajamas.

225
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:02,343
If they know your dad.
they won't think anything of it.

226
00:26:02,344 --> 00:26:05,046
Fire it up. Dad!

227
00:26:05,047 --> 00:26:10,047
I dedicate this house
to the Griswold family Christmas.

228
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:16,557
Drum roll, please.

229
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:21,558
Drum roll.

230
00:26:50,325 --> 00:26:55,325
- Beautiful. Clark.
- Talk about pissing your money away.

231
00:26:55,731 --> 00:27:00,334
I hope you kids see
what a silly waste of resources this was.

232
00:27:00,335 --> 00:27:05,335
- He worked really hard. Grandma.
- So do washing machines.

233
00:27:09,478 --> 00:27:11,813
Let's get in where it's warm.

234
00:27:11,814 --> 00:27:16,814
Clark. baby. I can picture it in my mind.
And it's breathtaking.

235
00:27:19,955 --> 00:27:23,524
- Thanks. Mom.
- It's probably a bad bulb. son.

236
00:27:23,525 --> 00:27:26,961
You know. if one goes out.
the whole thing doesn't work.

237
00:27:26,962 --> 00:27:30,464
Now. if I were you
I'd personally check each one.

238
00:27:30,465 --> 00:27:33,634
- I did that. Dad. I can't--
- Now. look. if you need any help...

239
00:27:33,635 --> 00:27:38,105
-...give me a holler. I'll be upstairs. asleep.
- Thanks.

240
00:27:38,106 --> 00:27:43,106
Sorry. Daddy. It looks good
even if they're not lit.

241
00:27:44,179 --> 00:27:49,179
Thank you. sweetheart.

242
00:27:52,187 --> 00:27:57,187
- Well. Dad. it was a good try.
- Thanks. Russ.

243
00:27:57,192 --> 00:27:59,126
- Russ.
- Yeah?

244
00:27:59,127 --> 00:28:04,127
- We checked every bulb. didn't we?
- Oh. yeah. Yeah. I'm sure of it.

245
00:28:05,834 --> 00:28:10,834
I thought so. Well, maybe
we ought to go up there and just get--

246
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:16,106
Jeez! Look at the time. I gotta get to bed.
Brush my teeth. Feed the hog.

247
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:21,749
I've still got some homework to do.
Do the laundry. Wash the car.

248
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:24,652
I've still got those bills to pay...

249
00:28:24,653 --> 00:28:29,653
Clark. don't stay up too late.

250
00:28:50,946 --> 00:28:55,946
Get off me. you little fungus.

251
00:30:54,503 --> 00:30:59,503
Where the hell is that cold coming from?

252
00:31:19,061 --> 00:31:20,227
Hello?

253
00:31:20,228 --> 00:31:23,064
- I need to get a few more--
- Pay by check.

254
00:31:23,065 --> 00:31:27,601
- I will. Not a card?
- No. If they return it, then it's a hassle...

255
00:31:27,602 --> 00:31:32,602
Russ!

256
00:31:33,675 --> 00:31:37,144
- Help!
- Daddy. is Clark coming?

257
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:39,346
- How would I know?
- Is he in the house?

258
00:31:39,347 --> 00:31:42,349
If he isn't farting around
with his lights. he must be inside.

259
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:45,286
I'm sure he wants to come shopping
and have lunch with us.

260
00:31:45,287 --> 00:31:50,287
He's got another car. He can drive.
I have to eat so I can take my back pills.

261
00:32:21,756 --> 00:32:26,756
Ellen! Hey! Ellen!

262
00:35:52,267 --> 00:35:57,267
I want to take off these clothes.
sit with a glass of wine and kiss your body.

263
00:35:57,405 --> 00:36:02,405
- After you shower. of course.
- Of course.

264
00:36:16,358 --> 00:36:21,358
- Sparky?
- Yes. honey.

265
00:36:28,069 --> 00:36:31,839
Are you out here for a reason.
or are you just avoiding the family?

266
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:35,743
No. I still have a couple hundred
more bulbs to check.

267
00:36:35,744 --> 00:36:40,681
In the meantime. I can light the Santa and
the reindeer and the Merry Christmas sign.

268
00:36:40,682 --> 00:36:43,784
<i>That should look good. Ready?</i>

269
00:36:43,785 --> 00:36:48,785
- You want me to do the drum roll thing?
- No. it's okay. Here goes nothing.

270
00:36:55,196 --> 00:36:58,499
I don't understand it.

271
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:03,500
The house lights don't work.
the flood lights don't work.

272
00:37:04,038 --> 00:37:05,873
Is it plugged in?

273
00:37:05,874 --> 00:37:08,675
Do you honestly think I would check
thousands of lights...

274
00:37:08,676 --> 00:37:13,676
...if the extension cord wasn't plugged in?

275
00:37:13,715 --> 00:37:18,585
You used more than one cord. didn't you?

276
00:37:18,586 --> 00:37:23,586
Maybe the kids have been fooling
around with it. I'll check in back.

277
00:37:43,378 --> 00:37:46,180
Clark!

278
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:49,783
Todd! What's that light?!

279
00:37:49,784 --> 00:37:52,052
Clark!

280
00:37:52,053 --> 00:37:57,053
Honey, I think I know what's wrong.

281
00:38:10,305 --> 00:38:12,306
I can't see.

282
00:38:12,307 --> 00:38:17,307
No. no. no--
Oh. my God--

283
00:38:30,024 --> 00:38:35,024
This ought to do it.

284
00:38:44,606 --> 00:38:48,308
Ellen. I fixed it!

285
00:38:48,309 --> 00:38:49,810
Oh. God!

286
00:38:49,811 --> 00:38:54,811
Everybody! Come out quick!
Look at the lights!

287
00:39:01,723 --> 00:39:06,723
- Get a towel.
- Okay!

288
00:39:07,295 --> 00:39:10,964
- Wait a minute. I don't believe this!
- What's all the yelling about?

289
00:39:10,965 --> 00:39:15,965
What?! But--
What's going on here?

290
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:20,674
Twenty-five thousand twinkle lights.

291
00:39:20,675 --> 00:39:23,911
- What's he doing. Clark?
- I haven't the foggiest.

292
00:39:23,912 --> 00:39:26,179
What?

293
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:31,180
What the hell? What is wrong with this?

294
00:39:32,353 --> 00:39:37,353
Damn it! Damn it!

295
00:39:38,393 --> 00:39:43,393
You goddamn light!

296
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:04,380
Go! Go! Do it!

297
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:17,860
Dad. it's beautiful!

298
00:40:30,812 --> 00:40:35,812
Oh. my carpet!

299
00:40:41,389 --> 00:40:46,389
- Oh. Clark. it's so lovely.
- Mom.

300
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:52,195
You deserve a home like this
to spend Christmas in.

301
00:40:53,167 --> 00:40:58,038
- It's a beaut. Clark. It's a beaut.
- Dad. Dad. Dad.

302
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:01,008
You taught me everything
I know about exterior illumination.

303
00:41:01,009 --> 00:41:03,910
Thank you. thank you.

304
00:41:03,911 --> 00:41:08,911
Russ. Audrey.

305
00:41:09,617 --> 00:41:14,617
Dear. dear Francis.

306
00:41:14,756 --> 00:41:18,091
I hope this adds to your enjoyment
of the holidays.

307
00:41:18,092 --> 00:41:22,362
- It's just wonderful.
- Yeah.

308
00:41:22,363 --> 00:41:27,134
Arthur. Art.

309
00:41:27,135 --> 00:41:28,568
Dad.

310
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:33,240
- Thanks for being here.
- The little lights are not twinkling.

311
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:38,241
I know. Art. and thanks for noticing.

312
00:41:40,515 --> 00:41:43,016
The house sure does look swell. Clark.

313
00:41:43,017 --> 00:41:48,017
Thanks. Eddie. I hope it enhances
your holiday spirit. Dear Cathrine.

314
00:41:49,323 --> 00:41:52,159
Eddie?

315
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:57,160
- Oh. the house is gorgeous. Clark.
- Eddie?

316
00:41:57,365 --> 00:42:00,801
I hope you didn't do this
all on our account. Clark.

317
00:42:00,802 --> 00:42:04,504
Kids. come on out here and see what
Uncle Clark's done to the house.

318
00:42:04,505 --> 00:42:09,505
Eddie?

319
00:42:13,014 --> 00:42:16,683
Eddie?

320
00:42:16,684 --> 00:42:21,088
Yeah. If you don't remember.
this here is Rocky.

321
00:42:21,089 --> 00:42:24,491
- You got a kiss for me?
- Better take a rain check on that. Art.

322
00:42:24,492 --> 00:42:29,492
He's got a lip fungus
they ain't identified yet.

323
00:42:30,064 --> 00:42:34,468
- You remember Ruby Sue?
- Oh. yeah.

324
00:42:34,469 --> 00:42:38,238
Oh. my gosh!

325
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:41,508
- Her eyes aren't crossed anymore.
- That's something. ain't it?

326
00:42:41,509 --> 00:42:46,279
Falls in a well. eyes go crossed. She gets
kicked by a mule. they go back to normal.

327
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:50,884
I don't know.

328
00:42:50,885 --> 00:42:55,522
And this here's our pride and joy. Snots.

329
00:42:55,523 --> 00:42:56,790
Pretty name. Ed.

330
00:42:56,791 --> 00:43:00,527
We named him that
because he's got this sinus condition.

331
00:43:00,528 --> 00:43:05,528
Snots. you roll over and let
Uncle Clark scratch your belly.

332
00:43:06,033 --> 00:43:10,237
You ain't never seen a set on a dog
like this one's got. Clark.

333
00:43:10,238 --> 00:43:12,172
That's okay. Eddie.

334
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:14,941
That's something. ain't it?
You pet him on the belly...

335
00:43:14,942 --> 00:43:17,310
...and he'll love you till the day you die.

336
00:43:17,311 --> 00:43:20,413
I really shouldn't.
My hands are all chapped.

337
00:43:20,414 --> 00:43:24,484
We were gonna call. but Eddie
wanted to make it a surprise.

338
00:43:24,485 --> 00:43:28,421
- Yeah. You surprised?
- Surprised. Eddie?

339
00:43:28,422 --> 00:43:33,422
If I woke up with my head sewn
to the carpet. I wouldn't be more surprised.

340
00:43:35,429 --> 00:43:39,432
We have plenty of room.

341
00:43:39,433 --> 00:43:44,433
We have plenty of towels.
We have plenty of everything.

342
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:49,242
We're pretty well set up here in the RV.
It's a little tight...

343
00:43:49,243 --> 00:43:52,979
-...but we didn't come to impose.
- Hell. there's plenty of room.

344
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:55,849
Quit being so damn polite. Ed.

345
00:43:55,850 --> 00:43:59,719
Cathrine and I. we're pretty
comfy in there, you know.

346
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:03,290
But maybe you wouldn't mind
the youngsters shacking up with you.

347
00:44:03,291 --> 00:44:08,291
After that long drive, we could
use a little private time together.

348
00:44:08,696 --> 00:44:13,696
Why don't you run and get the kids' things?
Don't forget the rubber sheets and gerbils.

349
00:44:13,701 --> 00:44:16,469
Come on. I wanna show you the home.

350
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:21,470
Audrey. help me get some
hot chocolate. It's cold.

351
00:44:53,641 --> 00:44:58,044
That's a honey of a tree. Clark.
Is it real?

352
00:44:58,045 --> 00:45:00,914
Yeah. Yeah. I dug it out
of the ground myself.

353
00:45:00,915 --> 00:45:04,684
- Is that a fact?
- Hey. get out of there. Snots! Yo!

354
00:45:04,685 --> 00:45:08,221
Don't worry about it, Clark.
A little tree water ain't gonna hurt him.

355
00:45:08,222 --> 00:45:11,091
Before we left, he drank
a half a quart of Pennzoil.

356
00:45:11,092 --> 00:45:16,092
Boy. when he lifted his leg
the next morning...

357
00:45:16,397 --> 00:45:20,100
If he drinks the water. the tree's
gonna dry up. Come on. out of there.

358
00:45:20,101 --> 00:45:22,335
- Snots.
- Out. out. out.

359
00:45:22,336 --> 00:45:24,404
Get out of there.
Get in the kitchen now.

360
00:45:24,405 --> 00:45:27,741
Get in the kitchen there and get
you something to eat. Go on.

361
00:45:27,742 --> 00:45:32,742
He's cute. ain't he? Problem is, he's got
a little bit of Mississippi leg hound in him.

362
00:45:33,547 --> 00:45:38,547
If the mood catches him right. he'll
grab your leg and just go to town.

363
00:45:38,719 --> 00:45:43,719
Don't want him around if you're wearing
short pants. if you know what I mean.

364
00:45:43,925 --> 00:45:48,925
A word of warning. though. If he does lay
into you. it's best to just let him finish.

365
00:45:51,065 --> 00:45:55,502
I can't believe you're actually standing
here in my living room. Eddie.

366
00:45:55,503 --> 00:45:59,940
- Never thought the day would come.
- Yeah. I'm excited about it too.

367
00:45:59,941 --> 00:46:04,941
It's a crying shame
the older kids couldn't make it.

368
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:11,380
I'll get that. Don't worry about it.
Let me get it.

369
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:18,120
Yeah. I got the daughter in the clinic.
getting cured off the Wild Turkey.

370
00:46:18,225 --> 00:46:22,963
And the older boy. bless his soul.
Is preparing for his career.

371
00:46:22,964 --> 00:46:25,699
- College?
- Carnival.

372
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:28,268
- You gotta be proud.
- Oh. yeah.

373
00:46:28,269 --> 00:46:32,505
Yeah. last season he was
a pixie-dust spreader on the Tilt-O-Whirl.

374
00:46:32,506 --> 00:46:34,441
He thinks maybe next year...

375
00:46:34,442 --> 00:46:39,442
...he'll be guessing people's weight
or barking for the Yak Woman.

376
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,681
- You ever see her?
- No.

377
00:46:41,682 --> 00:46:45,352
She's got these big horns
growing right out above her ears.

378
00:46:45,353 --> 00:46:49,089
Yeah. she's ugly as sin, but a sweet gal.
And a hell of a good cook.

379
00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:52,025
Can I refill your eggnog?
Get you something to eat?

380
00:46:52,026 --> 00:46:54,461
Drive you out to nowhere
and leave you for dead?

381
00:46:54,462 --> 00:46:58,765
No. I'm doing just fine. Clark.
Just glad to be here.

382
00:46:58,766 --> 00:47:03,766
Yeah. So when did you get
the tenement on wheels?

383
00:47:03,771 --> 00:47:07,040
Oh. that there? That's an RV.

384
00:47:07,041 --> 00:47:11,277
Yeah. yeah. I borrowed it off a buddy
of mine. He took my house...

385
00:47:11,278 --> 00:47:15,715
...I took the RV.
It's a good-looking vehicle. ain't it?

386
00:47:15,716 --> 00:47:18,151
Yeah. Looks so nice parked
in the driveway.

387
00:47:18,152 --> 00:47:22,422
Yeah. it sure does. But don't
you go falling in love with it now.

388
00:47:22,423 --> 00:47:27,423
Because we're taking it with us
when we leave here next month.

389
00:47:35,236 --> 00:47:38,805
Well. get Ed Leftic up here
to look over these figures.

390
00:47:38,806 --> 00:47:43,009
Oh. retooling. That's a great excuse.

391
00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:48,010
Retooling?! I'll retool you!

392
00:47:48,382 --> 00:47:52,919
- Mr. Shirley. merry Christmas.
- Who's that?

393
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:57,323
- It's me. Clark Griswold.
- What do you want?

394
00:47:57,324 --> 00:48:02,324
My wife and I came up with a little
something special. It's a gift.

395
00:48:02,763 --> 00:48:07,763
Put it over there with the others.
greaseball.

396
00:48:15,943 --> 00:48:20,943
By the way. I hope my report
helped out at the trade show.

397
00:48:25,352 --> 00:48:28,154
I'm sure it did. Grisball.

398
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:32,392
Now. if you'll excuse me.
I'm in the middle of an important call.

399
00:48:32,393 --> 00:48:36,763
Get me somebody. Anybody.

400
00:48:36,764 --> 00:48:41,764
And get me somebody while I wait.

401
00:48:51,479 --> 00:48:56,479
This is a new silicon-based kitchen
lubricant my company's been working on.

402
00:48:57,017 --> 00:49:00,954
It creates a surface 500 times
more slippery than any cooking oil.

403
00:49:00,955 --> 00:49:03,690
We're gonna fly down
the hill with this stuff.

404
00:49:03,691 --> 00:49:08,691
- Has anyone ever used it on a sled?
- Not that I know of. Russ.

405
00:49:09,897 --> 00:49:13,433
Well. don't go putting
none of that stuff on my sled. Clark.

406
00:49:13,434 --> 00:49:16,703
- You know that metal plate in my head?
- How could I forget?

407
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:20,673
I had to have it replaced because every
time Cathrine revved up the microwave...

408
00:49:20,674 --> 00:49:23,943
...I'd piss my pants and forget
who I was for a half-hour or so.

409
00:49:23,944 --> 00:49:28,944
Over at the V.A. they had to replace it with
a plastic one and it ain't as strong. so...

410
00:49:29,517 --> 00:49:32,919
I don't know if I ought to go down
no hill with nothing between...

411
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:37,920
...the ground and my brain
but a piece of government plastic.

412
00:49:37,958 --> 00:49:42,958
- You really think it matters, Eddie?
- The plate runs underneath my part here.

413
00:49:44,732 --> 00:49:47,300
Over here ifs. you know. nothing.

414
00:49:47,301 --> 00:49:52,301
But here. if this gets dented.
then my hair just ain't gonna look right.

415
00:49:54,842 --> 00:49:59,842
Yeah. I know the feeling.
I better try this first. see how it works.

416
00:50:00,114 --> 00:50:04,217
- Well. you be careful there.
- There's nothing to worry about. Eddie.

417
00:50:04,218 --> 00:50:08,922
Going for a new amateur recreational
saucer-sled land-speed record:

418
00:50:08,923 --> 00:50:12,091
Clark W. Griswold Jr.!

419
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:17,092
Remember, don't try this at home. kids.
I am a professional.

420
00:50:18,532 --> 00:50:23,532
Later. dudes. Let her rip. Hang 10.

421
00:50:24,305 --> 00:50:29,305
Oh. shit!

422
00:50:39,787 --> 00:50:44,787
This is great! It's great! It's great!
I'm dead!

423
00:51:02,509 --> 00:51:07,509
<i>Look out!</i>

424
00:51:28,736 --> 00:51:33,736
Bingo.

425
00:51:41,882 --> 00:51:46,882
- Clark? You staying late?
- Oh. hi. Bill. Yeah.

426
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:50,890
Just finishing up a few things.
Last day of the year for me.

427
00:51:50,891 --> 00:51:55,128
Well. have a really Merry Christmas.

428
00:51:55,129 --> 00:51:58,931
<i>You mo.</i>

429
00:51:58,932 --> 00:52:03,770
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

430
00:52:03,771 --> 00:52:06,506
Bill. did you get your bonus yet?

431
00:52:06,507 --> 00:52:08,975
I just talked to my son.

432
00:52:08,976 --> 00:52:12,278
Company messenger brought something
to the house. I guess that's it.

433
00:52:12,279 --> 00:52:17,279
Nothing like waiting till the
last minute. huh? Did you get yours?

434
00:52:18,986 --> 00:52:21,688
If it isn't at the house.
I'm sure it's on its way.

435
00:52:21,689 --> 00:52:26,092
If I don't get that bonus.
I'm in it up to here.

436
00:52:26,093 --> 00:52:31,093
- Don't sweat it. It'll come. Merry Christmas.
- Same to you.

437
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:52,474
Me?

438
00:54:41,895 --> 00:54:44,263
Santy Claus!

439
00:54:44,264 --> 00:54:46,799
Uncle Clark, are you Santy Claus?

440
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:51,537
What?

441
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:55,141
You scared me.

442
00:54:55,142 --> 00:55:00,142
No. I'm not Santa Claus.

443
00:55:00,614 --> 00:55:03,850
I wish I was.

444
00:55:03,851 --> 00:55:07,920
What are you doing up. sweetheart?

445
00:55:07,921 --> 00:55:10,289
- Rocky bit my thumb.
- What?

446
00:55:10,290 --> 00:55:14,327
Him's nervous because
Christmas is almost here.

447
00:55:14,328 --> 00:55:18,965
- Nervous or excited?
- Shitting bricks.

448
00:55:18,966 --> 00:55:23,769
- You shouldn't use that word.
- Sorry. Shitting rocks.

449
00:55:23,770 --> 00:55:25,838
I see. Good.

450
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:30,839
Him's nervous because he don't
know if he's getting nothing.

451
00:55:32,346 --> 00:55:35,615
I don't think he should be nervous
and you shouldn't be either.

452
00:55:35,616 --> 00:55:39,185
Because if you're good. Santa knows it.

453
00:55:39,186 --> 00:55:43,656
If you believe in him and you believe
in your mom and you believe in your...

454
00:55:43,657 --> 00:55:46,158
Your dad.

455
00:55:46,159 --> 00:55:51,159
If you've been good all year round.
Santa Claus is gonna bring you something.

456
00:55:51,465 --> 00:55:55,034
Sometimes I think all that
Santa crap is just bull.

457
00:55:55,035 --> 00:55:58,571
If he was so real. how come
we didn't get squat last year?

458
00:55:58,572 --> 00:56:02,108
We didn't do nothing wrong
and we still got the shaft.

459
00:56:02,109 --> 00:56:06,846
Well. I happen to know for a fact
that Santa Claus is real.

460
00:56:06,847 --> 00:56:09,482
And in the next couple of days...

461
00:56:09,483 --> 00:56:13,119
...somehow I'm gonna prove it to you.

462
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:17,523
You know. every year he comes
to our house. I've seen him.

463
00:56:17,524 --> 00:56:22,524
- That's true?
- Cross my heart.

464
00:56:24,264 --> 00:56:27,800
- So it's good you came to stay with us.
- I love it here.

465
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:30,670
You don't gotta put on your coat
to go to the bathroom.

466
00:56:30,671 --> 00:56:35,671
And your house is always parked
in the same place.

467
00:56:36,877 --> 00:56:41,480
I think you'd better go back to bed now.

468
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:46,481
Okay. How come you ain't sleeping?

469
00:56:46,887 --> 00:56:51,887
Oh. I was just looking for something.

470
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:57,463
You didn't notice if a man came here
and delivered a letter today. did you?

471
00:56:57,464 --> 00:56:59,665
Nope. How come?

472
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:04,666
Oh. just wondering.

473
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:11,940
Now you get back to bed. Come on.

474
00:57:15,882 --> 00:57:20,052
Uncle Clark, are you sure
you ain't Santy Claus?

475
00:57:20,053 --> 00:57:25,053
I'm sure.

476
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:31,193
I can't even afford to be an elf.

477
00:57:38,805 --> 00:57:43,476
Two containers of K rations!
Two containers of K rations!

478
00:57:43,477 --> 00:57:47,113
Then I had Spam until
it was coming out of my ears.

479
00:57:47,114 --> 00:57:52,114
Oh. bullshit!

480
00:57:58,692 --> 00:58:03,692
- Aren't you having any breakfast?
- I'm not in the mood.

481
00:58:03,830 --> 00:58:07,033
What are you looking at?

482
00:58:07,034 --> 00:58:10,369
Oh. the silent majesty of a winter's morn.

483
00:58:10,370 --> 00:58:13,706
The clean. cool chill of the holiday air.

484
00:58:13,707 --> 00:58:18,707
And an asshole in his bathrobe emptying
a chemical toilet into my sewer.

485
00:58:22,649 --> 00:58:25,685
- Shitter was full!
- Yeah.

486
00:58:25,686 --> 00:58:28,587
- Have you checked our shitters. honey?
- Clark. please.

487
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:31,190
- He doesn't know any better.
- It's illegal.

488
00:58:31,191 --> 00:58:36,191
It's a storm sewer. If it fills with gas. I pity
the person who lights a match near it.

489
00:58:59,052 --> 00:59:04,052
Merry Christmas. Shitter was full.

490
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:22,041
<i>I have a terrible suspicion Cathrine
and Eddie don't have presents for their kids.</i>

491
00:59:22,042 --> 00:59:27,042
Rocky said something about Eddie telling
him Santa Claus wasn't coming this year.

492
00:59:28,281 --> 00:59:32,017
Yeah. Ruby Sue said something
like that last night.

493
00:59:32,018 --> 00:59:35,955
- How can they have nothing for the kids?
- He's been out of work for seven years.

494
00:59:35,956 --> 00:59:38,257
In seven years he couldn't find a job?

495
00:59:38,258 --> 00:59:43,258
Cathrine says he's been holding out
for a management position.

496
00:59:46,032 --> 00:59:51,032
- So how's the live-bait business, Eddie?
- Well. I can't complain. How you doing?

497
00:59:51,605 --> 00:59:53,539
Not that good. actually.

498
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:57,042
Your company kill off all them
people over in India not long ago?

499
00:59:57,043 --> 01:00:02,043
No. We missed out on that one. You're
pretty set so far as shopping goes?

500
01:00:02,916 --> 01:00:07,916
Well. I can't lie to you. Clark. The truth
is. things ain't going too good at all.

501
01:00:08,355 --> 01:00:13,355
You know. I told you I borrowed the RV
from my neighbor? Nope. It's mine.

502
01:00:13,827 --> 01:00:18,827
We live in it. I had to sell off
the house. the barn. the 10 acres.

503
01:00:19,833 --> 01:00:24,833
All I kept was a 50-foot plot.
the pigs and the worm farm.

504
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:29,308
If only I had back the money
that me and Cathrine...

505
01:00:29,309 --> 01:00:33,913
...sent that TV preacher that was
screwing the hockey players.

506
01:00:33,914 --> 01:00:35,981
What about the kids?

507
01:00:35,982 --> 01:00:39,819
- His kids can fend for themselves.
- No. your kids.

508
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:43,489
Oh. well. that's the bitch of it.
See. I don't know what to do.

509
01:00:43,490 --> 01:00:48,490
We coasted into town on fumes.
The gas money give out in Gurnee.

510
01:00:49,529 --> 01:00:52,398
Eddie...

511
01:00:52,399 --> 01:00:56,035
Ellen and I want to help you
give the kids a nice Christmas.

512
01:00:56,036 --> 01:00:59,672
- Clark. I couldn't do that.
- No. no. we insist.

513
01:00:59,673 --> 01:01:02,341
Oh. no. I'm not one
for charity. now.

514
01:01:02,342 --> 01:01:07,342
Oh. I know that. Eddie.
This isn't charity. It's family.

515
01:01:08,148 --> 01:01:11,517
- I don't know about that.
- Now. come on.

516
01:01:11,518 --> 01:01:16,518
If you don't tell me what they want.
I'll go out and get it on my own.

517
01:01:17,157 --> 01:01:21,927
Oh. boy.
This is a surprise, Clark.

518
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:26,928
This is just a real nice surprise.
Just a real nice surprise.

519
01:01:32,806 --> 01:01:37,042
Here's a little list.
Alphabetical. starting with Cathrine.

520
01:01:37,043 --> 01:01:41,146
And if it wouldn't be too much.
I'd like to get something for you. Clark.

521
01:01:41,147 --> 01:01:46,147
Something really nice.

522
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:05,137
- Is your house on fire. Clark?
- No. Bethany. Those are Christmas lights.

523
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:09,208
- Don't throw me down. Clark.
- I'll try not to. Aunt Bethany.

524
01:02:09,209 --> 01:02:12,478
- Is this the airport. Clark?
- We're here!

525
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:16,215
Hey. Gris. me and Bethany
figured out the perfect gift for you.

526
01:02:16,216 --> 01:02:19,084
Oh. Uncle Lewis. you didn't
have to buy me anything.

527
01:02:19,085 --> 01:02:22,221
Damn it. Bethany. he guessed it.

528
01:02:22,222 --> 01:02:27,222
Oh. that was fun.
I love riding in cars.

529
01:02:27,527 --> 01:02:31,864
When did you move to Florida?

530
01:02:31,865 --> 01:02:36,635
Ellen. are you still dating Clark?

531
01:02:36,636 --> 01:02:41,073
Oh. Aunt Bethany. you know
you shouldn't have done that.

532
01:02:41,074 --> 01:02:44,076
Oh. dear. Did I break wind?

533
01:02:44,077 --> 01:02:47,780
Jesus. did the room clear out. Bethany?

534
01:02:47,781 --> 01:02:51,817
Hell. no. She means presents.
You shouldn't have brought presents.

535
01:02:51,818 --> 01:02:55,821
It isn't every day somebody
moves into a new house.

536
01:02:55,822 --> 01:02:59,158
They didn't move into a new house.

537
01:02:59,159 --> 01:03:03,629
- Mom?
- In the living room. Russ.

538
01:03:03,630 --> 01:03:07,733
This house is bigger
than your old one.

539
01:03:07,734 --> 01:03:09,868
Is Rusty still in the Navy?

540
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:14,073
Aunt Bethany. why don't you go with
Francis and Cathrine into the living room...

541
01:03:14,074 --> 01:03:16,742
-...and say hello to everybody.
- Hello. everybody?

542
01:03:16,743 --> 01:03:19,044
- Just in the living room.
- I should say it?

543
01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:23,182
- You should say it.
- Hello. everybody!

544
01:03:23,183 --> 01:03:24,917
- Mom.
- What?

545
01:03:24,918 --> 01:03:29,918
- This box is meowing.
- Let me see it.

546
01:03:33,426 --> 01:03:36,829
- She wrapped up her cat.
- Take it in the kitchen and open it up.

547
01:03:36,830 --> 01:03:39,965
- Then we'll have a cat running around.
- You can't leave it in the box.

548
01:03:39,966 --> 01:03:42,568
Why would somebody
wrap up a cat in a box?

549
01:03:42,569 --> 01:03:46,271
She gets confused. Rusty. She and
Uncle Lewis don't have much money...

550
01:03:46,272 --> 01:03:49,708
...so she takes things from the house
and gives them as presents.

551
01:03:49,709 --> 01:03:51,777
Great. Can't wait to see what I got.

552
01:03:51,778 --> 01:03:56,778
This one here is leaking.

553
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:04,723
- It's lime.
- That's her Jell-O mold. I'll take it. Eddie.

554
01:04:04,724 --> 01:04:08,660
Why don't you go back in the living room
and enjoy yourself? Russ?

555
01:04:08,661 --> 01:04:11,430
Come on. boy.

556
01:04:11,431 --> 01:04:16,431
Let's go find your sister.

557
01:04:34,220 --> 01:04:39,220
Before we begin. since this is
Aunt Bethany's 80th Christmas...

558
01:04:39,359 --> 01:04:43,595
...I think she should lead us
in the saying of grace.

559
01:04:43,596 --> 01:04:46,532
Great.

560
01:04:46,533 --> 01:04:49,668
What. dear?

561
01:04:49,669 --> 01:04:51,970
Grace!

562
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:56,375
Grace? She passed away
30 years ago.

563
01:04:56,376 --> 01:05:01,376
They want you
to say grace.

564
01:05:01,448 --> 01:05:06,448
The blessing.

565
01:05:20,433 --> 01:05:25,433
I pledge allegiance to the flag
of the United States of America...

566
01:05:26,406 --> 01:05:30,008
...and to the republic
for which it stands...

567
01:05:30,009 --> 01:05:32,611
...one nation under God.
Indivisible...

568
01:05:32,612 --> 01:05:37,612
...with liberty
and justice for all.

569
01:05:38,518 --> 01:05:43,518
- Amen.
- Amen.

570
01:05:45,525 --> 01:05:49,661
Cathrine. if this turkey tastes
half as good as it looks...

571
01:05:49,662 --> 01:05:53,232
...I think we're all in
for a very big treat.

572
01:05:53,233 --> 01:05:56,568
Thank you.

573
01:05:56,569 --> 01:06:01,569
- Save the neck for me. Clark.
- Okay. Eddie.

574
01:06:09,015 --> 01:06:14,015
Look at that.

575
01:06:14,921 --> 01:06:16,922
Sorry.

576
01:06:16,923 --> 01:06:21,093
- Why are you crying?
- I told you we put it in too early.

577
01:06:21,094 --> 01:06:26,094
- Oh. it's just a little dry. It's fine.
- It looks good to me.

578
01:06:26,166 --> 01:06:31,166
Here's the heart.

579
01:07:28,294 --> 01:07:31,263
Aunt Bethany?

580
01:07:31,264 --> 01:07:35,901
Does your cat, by any chance.
eat Jell-O?

581
01:07:35,902 --> 01:07:40,902
Well. I don't know about the cat.
but I sure am enjoying it.

582
01:07:52,685 --> 01:07:54,486
Hey. kids?

583
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:59,487
I heard on the news that a pilot spotted
Santa's sled on its way in from New York.

584
01:08:06,065 --> 01:08:09,968
You serious, Clark?

585
01:08:09,969 --> 01:08:14,969
Art. you want to load me up with
a little more there. It is good.

586
01:08:23,583 --> 01:08:24,950
- Ed?
- Yeah. Clark.

587
01:08:24,951 --> 01:08:29,951
What's wrong with the dog?

588
01:08:30,189 --> 01:08:35,189
Oh. he's just yacking on a bone.
He's got it up. He's all right now.

589
01:08:36,663 --> 01:08:40,899
Maybe if you wouldn't
feed him from the table.

590
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:43,468
No. no.

591
01:08:43,469 --> 01:08:48,469
He's probably just nosing
through the trash there.

592
01:08:54,847 --> 01:08:58,750
Hey. Gris. if you're not doing
anything constructive...

593
01:08:58,751 --> 01:09:02,921
...run into the living room.
get my stogy.

594
01:09:02,922 --> 01:09:06,191
Is there anything else I can
do for you. Uncle Lewis?

595
01:09:06,192 --> 01:09:09,761
He's an old man.
This may be his last Christmas.

596
01:09:09,762 --> 01:09:14,762
If he keeps it up.
It will be his last Christmas.

597
01:09:46,332 --> 01:09:51,332
That should be it.

598
01:09:54,807 --> 01:09:59,807
Honey?

599
01:10:04,050 --> 01:10:09,050
- You had too many plugs in one outlet.
- Oh. God.

600
01:10:09,222 --> 01:10:12,424
What is it?

601
01:10:12,425 --> 01:10:17,425
Nothing. Let's go in
and finish our dessert.

602
01:10:17,930 --> 01:10:22,930
If that thing had nine lives.
she just spent them all.

603
01:10:26,072 --> 01:10:30,776
If you don't mind. Clark. I'd like to see
if I can fumigate this here chair.

604
01:10:30,777 --> 01:10:34,813
It's a good. quality item.

605
01:10:34,814 --> 01:10:39,814
If you don't mind me asking.
how much it set you back?

606
01:10:39,919 --> 01:10:43,822
You smell something?

607
01:10:43,823 --> 01:10:47,893
Fried pussycat.

608
01:10:47,894 --> 01:10:52,894
It's not the chair. It's some kind
of gas coming from the sewer.

609
01:11:39,111 --> 01:11:41,613
Lewis?

610
01:11:41,614 --> 01:11:44,916
My tree!

611
01:11:44,917 --> 01:11:48,153
So, what's the matter with you?

612
01:11:48,154 --> 01:11:53,154
Look what you've done to my tree!

613
01:11:53,326 --> 01:11:58,326
Lewis.

614
01:12:05,638 --> 01:12:08,240
It was an ugly tree. anyway.

615
01:12:08,241 --> 01:12:10,976
At least it's out of its misery.

616
01:12:10,977 --> 01:12:13,278
- Dad's gonna flip out.
- Nobody's gonna flip out.

617
01:12:13,279 --> 01:12:18,279
We're gonna have
a wonderful Christmas.

618
01:12:19,118 --> 01:12:20,785
What the hell do you want?

619
01:12:20,786 --> 01:12:25,786
I have a delivery for Clark W. Grisman.
I was supposed to deliver it yesterday...

620
01:12:26,125 --> 01:12:31,125
...but it fell between the seats.
and I didn't see it. I'm sorry.

621
01:12:37,670 --> 01:12:40,372
Merry Christmas.

622
01:12:40,373 --> 01:12:45,373
Merry Christmas.

623
01:12:45,511 --> 01:12:47,913
- I can't believe it.
- What is it?

624
01:12:47,914 --> 01:12:51,249
A letter confirming your reservation
at the nut house?

625
01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:53,385
It's from my company.

626
01:12:53,386 --> 01:12:58,386
- Your bonus.
- My bonus.

627
01:13:01,627 --> 01:13:04,229
Open it. Clarkie.
Open it.

628
01:13:04,230 --> 01:13:06,865
Yeah. I hope it's a fortune. Clark.

629
01:13:06,866 --> 01:13:11,866
I bet you do. Eddie.

630
01:13:12,872 --> 01:13:14,306
I was afraid...

631
01:13:14,307 --> 01:13:19,307
Are you gonna bawl all over it.
or are you gonna open it?

632
01:13:19,345 --> 01:13:24,345
I was gonna wait till tomorrow to tell
you all this. but what the heck.

633
01:13:25,117 --> 01:13:30,117
With this bonus check.
I'm putting in a swimming pool.

634
01:13:32,992 --> 01:13:37,729
That's it. That's the big one!

635
01:13:37,730 --> 01:13:41,032
Open it!

636
01:13:41,033 --> 01:13:44,970
I'm sorry if I've been a little short
with everyone lately.

637
01:13:44,971 --> 01:13:47,238
I've been waiting
for this bonus.

638
01:13:47,239 --> 01:13:50,075
To make sure the pool goes in
when the ground thaws...

639
01:13:50,076 --> 01:13:52,944
...I had to pay in advance.
And until this arrived...

640
01:13:52,945 --> 01:13:56,281
...I didn't have enough in my account
to cover the check.

641
01:13:56,282 --> 01:14:00,018
- Tear the sucker open, Dad.
- Yeah.

642
01:14:00,019 --> 01:14:05,019
Drum roll. Just kidding.

643
01:14:09,662 --> 01:14:14,662
If there's enough left over. I'm gonna fly
you all down here to help us dedicate it.

644
01:14:18,037 --> 01:14:20,939
I can't swim. Clark.

645
01:14:20,940 --> 01:14:25,940
I know that. Eddie.

646
01:14:37,156 --> 01:14:39,357
Clark. what's wrong?

647
01:14:39,358 --> 01:14:41,893
Honey?

648
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:46,894
It's bigger than you expected?

649
01:14:47,833 --> 01:14:51,770
Smaller?

650
01:14:51,771 --> 01:14:54,439
What is it?

651
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:58,576
It's a one-year membership
in the Jelly of the Month Club.

652
01:14:58,577 --> 01:14:59,744
<i>Oh. God.</i>

653
01:14:59,745 --> 01:15:04,745
Clark. that's the gift that keeps
on giving the whole year.

654
01:15:05,518 --> 01:15:09,721
That it is. Edward.
That it is. indeed.

655
01:15:09,722 --> 01:15:13,291
I'm sorry. Clark...

656
01:15:13,292 --> 01:15:18,292
If this isn't the biggest bag-over-the-head
punch in the face I ever got. Goddamn it!

657
01:15:18,998 --> 01:15:23,998
Son.

658
01:15:33,379 --> 01:15:38,379
That's good. That's good.
That's <i>good.</i>

659
01:15:41,654 --> 01:15:43,988
Hey!

660
01:15:43,989 --> 01:15:48,989
If any of you are looking for any
last-minute gift ideas for me. I have one.

661
01:15:49,562 --> 01:15:53,565
I'd like Frank Shirley. my boss.
right here. tonight.

662
01:15:53,566 --> 01:15:57,068
I want him brought from his happy
holiday slumber on Melody Lane...

663
01:15:57,069 --> 01:16:00,305
...with all the other rich people.
and I want him right here.

664
01:16:00,306 --> 01:16:02,874
With a big ribbon on his head.

665
01:16:02,875 --> 01:16:05,577
I wanna look him straight
in the eye and tell him...

666
01:16:05,578 --> 01:16:08,613
...what a cheap. lying. no good.
rotten. four-flushing...

667
01:16:08,614 --> 01:16:11,883
...low-life. snake-licking. dirt-eating.
Inbred. overstuffed...

668
01:16:11,884 --> 01:16:16,821
...ignorant, bloodsucking. dog-kissing.
brainless. dickless. hopeless...

669
01:16:16,822 --> 01:16:20,759
...heartless. fat-assed. bug-eyed.
stiff-legged. spotty-lipped...

670
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:23,928
...worm-headed sack
of monkey shit he is!

671
01:16:23,929 --> 01:16:28,929
Hallelujah! Holy shit!
Where's the Tylenol?

672
01:16:41,781 --> 01:16:46,484
- He's got that crazed look in his eye.
- I told you we should've gone to Hawaii.

673
01:16:46,485 --> 01:16:49,888
Turn that thing off
and get in the house!

674
01:16:49,889 --> 01:16:54,889
I'll talk to him. Mom.

675
01:16:55,094 --> 01:16:59,764
You know. Dad.
I've been thinking.

676
01:16:59,765 --> 01:17:04,765
Good talk. Dad.

677
01:17:06,939 --> 01:17:09,741
Aren't you a bit sorry we didn't
get a Christmas tree?

678
01:17:09,742 --> 01:17:13,444
Even though they're dirty and
messy and corny and clichéd.

679
01:17:13,445 --> 01:17:18,445
Well. where you gonna find a tree
at this hour on Christmas Eve?

680
01:17:36,335 --> 01:17:39,270
What's the matter?

681
01:17:39,271 --> 01:17:43,274
Was that really necessary?

682
01:17:43,275 --> 01:17:45,777
- We needed a tree.
- May I remind you that--

683
01:17:45,778 --> 01:17:50,281
That this was all my idea. No.
No. no. I'm well aware of that. honey.

684
01:17:50,282 --> 01:17:53,918
Could you just keep it in mind
the next time you go berserk?

685
01:17:53,919 --> 01:17:58,919
I didn't go berserk.
I simply solved a problem.

686
01:17:59,458 --> 01:18:03,995
We needed a coffin.
I mean. a tree.

687
01:18:03,996 --> 01:18:06,264
There are no lots open
on Christmas Eve.

688
01:18:06,265 --> 01:18:10,835
Lewis burned down my tree.
so I replaced it as best I could. Voila'.

689
01:18:10,836 --> 01:18:15,836
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine. honey.

690
01:18:38,397 --> 01:18:43,397
Fixed the newelpost.

691
01:19:02,922 --> 01:19:07,922
What's that sound?

692
01:19:26,445 --> 01:19:31,445
Do you hear it?
It's a funny squeaky sound.

693
01:19:31,984 --> 01:19:36,984
You couldn't hear a dump truck
driving through a nitroglycerin plant.

694
01:19:37,990 --> 01:19:42,990
I hear it too.

695
01:19:48,100 --> 01:19:53,100
I don't hear it anymore.

696
01:20:03,649 --> 01:20:08,649
What was it?! Oh. my God!

697
01:20:11,991 --> 01:20:16,991
Quiet! Shut up!

698
01:20:27,006 --> 01:20:30,341
Mom. don't move.

699
01:20:30,342 --> 01:20:33,945
We can't let it get out
of the living room.

700
01:20:33,946 --> 01:20:36,814
Where's Eddie? He usually eats
these goddamn things.

701
01:20:36,815 --> 01:20:41,815
Oh. not recently. Clark. He read that
squirrels were high in cholesterol.

702
01:20:41,987 --> 01:20:44,722
Thank you. Cathrine.

703
01:20:44,723 --> 01:20:46,391
I'll try and trap it.

704
01:20:46,392 --> 01:20:48,926
- Russ!
- Right here. Dad.

705
01:20:48,927 --> 01:20:51,562
Oh. there you are.

706
01:20:51,563 --> 01:20:53,164
Go get the hammer.

707
01:20:53,165 --> 01:20:55,466
Clark. what do you need
a hammer for?

708
01:20:55,467 --> 01:21:00,467
I'm gonna catch it in the coat
and smack it with the hammer.

709
01:21:06,612 --> 01:21:11,612
I'm going in with him.

710
01:21:11,884 --> 01:21:14,519
Nora?

711
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:17,488
- Nora!
- Is it gone?

712
01:21:17,489 --> 01:21:20,825
It probably got scared
and ran back into the tree.

713
01:21:20,826 --> 01:21:25,826
Squirrel!

714
01:22:01,333 --> 01:22:05,703
You just march right over there
and slug that creep in the face.

715
01:22:05,704 --> 01:22:08,940
- I can't just attack someone.
-If you're not man enough...

716
01:22:08,941 --> 01:22:13,941
...to put an end to this shit.
then I am.

717
01:22:39,571 --> 01:22:44,442
Oh. my God!

718
01:22:44,443 --> 01:22:49,443
What happened to you?

719
01:22:53,685 --> 01:22:58,685
Beautiful. God.

720
01:22:58,724 --> 01:23:01,893
Where do you think you're going?
Nobody's leaving.

721
01:23:01,894 --> 01:23:04,729
Nobody's walking out
on this family Christmas.

722
01:23:04,730 --> 01:23:07,398
No. no. We're all in this together.

723
01:23:07,399 --> 01:23:10,701
This is a full-blown. four-alarm
holiday emergency here.

724
01:23:10,702 --> 01:23:14,272
We're gonna press on. and we're gonna
have the hap-hap-happiest Christmas...

725
01:23:14,273 --> 01:23:17,108
...since Bing Crosby tap-danced
with Danny Kaye.

726
01:23:17,109 --> 01:23:20,244
And when Santa squeezes his ass
down that chimney tonight...

727
01:23:20,245 --> 01:23:24,615
...he's gonna find the jolliest bunch
of assholes this side of the nut house.

728
01:23:24,616 --> 01:23:26,050
You're goofy.

729
01:23:26,051 --> 01:23:28,886
- Don't piss me off. Art.
- Clark?

730
01:23:28,887 --> 01:23:31,255
- It's over.
- Not according to Santa's watch.

731
01:23:31,256 --> 01:23:33,257
- Come on. son.
- Stay out of this. Dad.

732
01:23:33,258 --> 01:23:36,861
Clark. I think it's best
if everyone just goes home.

733
01:23:36,862 --> 01:23:39,997
- Before things get worse.
- Worse?

734
01:23:39,998 --> 01:23:41,699
How could they
get any worse?

735
01:23:41,700 --> 01:23:46,700
Take a look around you. Ellen.
We're at the threshold of hell.

736
01:24:03,789 --> 01:24:06,457
Son?

737
01:24:06,458 --> 01:24:09,260
I love you.
We all love you.

738
01:24:09,261 --> 01:24:13,598
But this is a terrible night.
Nothing's gone right. It's a disaster.

739
01:24:13,599 --> 01:24:17,034
You losing your temper with
the whole family only makes things worse.

740
01:24:17,035 --> 01:24:21,372
You're too good a father
to act like this.

741
01:24:21,373 --> 01:24:26,043
In years to come, you'll want your family
to remember all the love you gave us.

742
01:24:26,044 --> 01:24:29,080
And how hard you tried
to make the perfect Christmas.

743
01:24:29,081 --> 01:24:33,551
- Well. I just--
- You just cocked it up.

744
01:24:33,552 --> 01:24:38,552
Oh. it's okay. It happens.

745
01:24:38,957 --> 01:24:43,261
- Our holidays were always such a mess.
- Oh. yeah.

746
01:24:43,262 --> 01:24:45,930
How did you
get through it?

747
01:24:45,931 --> 01:24:50,931
I had a lot of help
from Jack Daniels.

748
01:24:57,643 --> 01:25:01,245
I love you.

749
01:25:01,246 --> 01:25:03,581
- Dad?
- Yeah.

750
01:25:03,582 --> 01:25:07,285
<i>Are you gonna recite
The Night Before Christmas?</i>

751
01:25:07,286 --> 01:25:11,122
It's your house.
It's your Christmas.

752
01:25:11,123 --> 01:25:14,158
I'm retiring.

753
01:25:14,159 --> 01:25:17,194
“The children were nestled
all snug in their beds...

754
01:25:17,195 --> 01:25:20,831
...while visions of sugarplums
danced in their heads.

755
01:25:20,832 --> 01:25:23,668
And Mama in her kerchief
and I in my cap...

756
01:25:23,669 --> 01:25:26,737
...had just settled our brains
for a long winter's nap.

757
01:25:26,738 --> 01:25:30,374
When out on the lawn.
there arose such a clatter...

758
01:25:30,375 --> 01:25:32,543
...I sprang from my bed to see
what was the matter.

759
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:34,912
Away to the window.
I flew like a flash...

760
01:25:34,913 --> 01:25:37,748
...tore open the shutters
and threw up the sash.

761
01:25:37,749 --> 01:25:42,320
The moon on the new-fallen snow
gave a luster of midday to objects below.

762
01:25:42,321 --> 01:25:47,321
When what to my wondering eyes should
appear but a miniature sleigh and...“

763
01:25:48,327 --> 01:25:52,129
And Eddie with a man in his
pajamas with a dog chain...

764
01:25:52,130 --> 01:25:56,967
...tied to his wrists and ankles.
What the“?

765
01:25:56,968 --> 01:26:01,968
Stay here.

766
01:26:03,175 --> 01:26:07,878
Ho. ho. ho.
Merry Christmas. Clark.

767
01:26:07,879 --> 01:26:12,383
You about ready to do some kissing?

768
01:26:12,384 --> 01:26:15,152
Yes. officer. it seems my husband's
been abducted.

769
01:26:15,153 --> 01:26:17,355
The man was...

770
01:26:17,356 --> 01:26:22,059
...wearing a blue leisure suit.
and the plates were from Kansas.

771
01:26:22,060 --> 01:26:25,763
He was a huge. beastly.
bulging man and--

772
01:26:25,764 --> 01:26:28,265
I've never been treated
like this in my life.

773
01:26:28,266 --> 01:26:31,836
I'm sorry. This is our family's
first kidnapping.

774
01:26:31,837 --> 01:26:35,172
You're fired. And where's the phone?
I'm calling the police.

775
01:26:35,173 --> 01:26:39,377
Hey. just hold your wad there. fella.
Clark had nothing to do with this.

776
01:26:39,378 --> 01:26:41,679
This here was my idea.

777
01:26:41,680 --> 01:26:45,716
All right. He's still fired.
and you are going to jail.

778
01:26:45,717 --> 01:26:49,820
Oh. no. Eddie. it was my fault.

779
01:26:49,821 --> 01:26:52,123
I lost my temper
when I got my bonus.

780
01:26:52,124 --> 01:26:55,393
- I guess I said some things I shouldn't have.
- Bonus?

781
01:26:55,394 --> 01:26:58,863
How did you get a bonus?
I cut out bonuses this year.

782
01:26:58,864 --> 01:27:01,499
Yeah. Thanks for telling us.

783
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:05,503
I was expecting a check.
Instead I got enrolled in a jelly club.

784
01:27:05,504 --> 01:27:09,774
Seventeen years with the company. I've
gotten a bonus every year but this one.

785
01:27:09,775 --> 01:27:11,742
You don't wanna give bonuses. fine!

786
01:27:11,743 --> 01:27:14,678
But when people count on them
as part of their salary...

787
01:27:14,679 --> 01:27:19,183
-...well. what you did just plain--
- Sucks.

788
01:27:19,184 --> 01:27:22,386
Thank you. Russ.

789
01:27:22,387 --> 01:27:24,255
My...

790
01:27:24,256 --> 01:27:27,425
...cousin-in-law. whose heart
is bigger than his brain--

791
01:27:27,426 --> 01:27:30,327
I appreciate that. Clark.

792
01:27:30,328 --> 01:27:33,831
Is innocent. I'll be more than happy
to take the rap on this.

793
01:27:33,832 --> 01:27:38,832
On behalf of myself and every other
employee you rear-ended this Christmas.

794
01:27:56,788 --> 01:27:59,790
Look...

795
01:27:59,791 --> 01:28:03,127
...sometimes things <i>look</i>
good <i>on</i> paper...

796
01:28:03,128 --> 01:28:07,998
...but lose their luster when you see
how it affects real folks.

797
01:28:07,999 --> 01:28:10,501
I guess a healthy bottom line
doesn't mean much...

798
01:28:10,502 --> 01:28:15,502
...if to get it you have to hurt
the ones you depend on.

799
01:28:15,740 --> 01:28:18,843
It's people that make the difference.

800
01:28:18,844 --> 01:28:22,847
Little people. like you.

801
01:28:22,848 --> 01:28:26,617
So. Carl...

802
01:28:26,618 --> 01:28:29,220
...whatever you got last year...

803
01:28:29,221 --> 01:28:33,057
...add 20 percent.

804
01:28:33,058 --> 01:28:38,058
Our pool!

805
01:28:39,331 --> 01:28:44,331
Dad.

806
01:29:24,743 --> 01:29:27,478
Go away. Todd.

807
01:29:27,479 --> 01:29:32,479
If you wanna come in. you are gonna have
to break down the goddamn door!

808
01:29:43,461 --> 01:29:48,461
Merry Christmas to all
and to all a good night!

809
01:29:58,243 --> 01:30:01,579
Freeze!

810
01:30:01,580 --> 01:30:06,580
Not you. them!
Them!

811
01:30:13,124 --> 01:30:17,561
This way. please.

812
01:30:17,562 --> 01:30:21,632
- I think you've made a terrible mistake.
- I told you to freeze, mister.

813
01:30:21,633 --> 01:30:26,633
May we blink?

814
01:30:26,805 --> 01:30:28,906
Frank.

815
01:30:28,907 --> 01:30:30,841
- Helen!
- Thank God. you're all right.

816
01:30:30,842 --> 01:30:32,843
Oh. I'm fine.
I'm just fine.

817
01:30:32,844 --> 01:30:35,179
It was a big misunderstanding tonight.

818
01:30:35,180 --> 01:30:38,616
Excuse me. Would you and
Mrs. Shirley like to step outside...

819
01:30:38,617 --> 01:30:40,851
...so we can take care
of business here?

820
01:30:40,852 --> 01:30:43,721
There's no business.
I'm not pressing any charges.

821
01:30:43,722 --> 01:30:45,856
- What?
- It was a mistake.

822
01:30:45,857 --> 01:30:49,059
Mistake? Frank. honey.
you were kidnapped.

823
01:30:49,060 --> 01:30:52,963
I did something I shouldn't have.
and these people called me on it.

824
01:30:52,964 --> 01:30:56,166
This is Clark Griswold
and his family.

825
01:30:56,167 --> 01:30:59,103
Welcome to our home.

826
01:30:59,104 --> 01:31:00,671
What's left of it.

827
01:31:00,672 --> 01:31:03,874
- Release B Squad.
- What's going on here?

828
01:31:03,875 --> 01:31:08,875
Remember how I was toying with the notion
of suspending the Christmas bonuses?

829
01:31:09,014 --> 01:31:14,014
You didn't. Well, of all the cheap.
lousy ways to save a buck!

830
01:31:14,019 --> 01:31:17,821
That's pretty low. mister. If I had
a rubber hose. I would beat you to--

831
01:31:17,822 --> 01:31:22,493
I changed my mind.
I'm reinstating the bonuses.

832
01:31:22,494 --> 01:31:25,729
<i>Look'.!</i>

833
01:31:25,730 --> 01:31:29,867
<i>Look. look!</i>

834
01:31:29,868 --> 01:31:31,468
<i>Look'.!</i>

835
01:31:31,469 --> 01:31:36,469
Ruby Sue. sweetheart.

836
01:31:37,709 --> 01:31:41,979
- It's Santa Claus.
- What? What's wrong?

837
01:31:41,980 --> 01:31:45,282
- What?
- She thinks she sees Santa.

838
01:31:45,283 --> 01:31:49,019
No. it's the Christmas star.

839
01:31:49,020 --> 01:31:52,489
And that's all that matters tonight.

840
01:31:52,490 --> 01:31:56,960
Not bonuses or gifts
or turkeys or trees.

841
01:31:56,961 --> 01:31:59,229
See. kids...

842
01:31:59,230 --> 01:32:04,001
...it means something different
to everybody.

843
01:32:04,002 --> 01:32:07,771
Now I know what it means to me.

844
01:32:07,772 --> 01:32:12,772
That ain't the frigging Christmas star. Gris.
It's a light on the sewage treatment plant.

845
01:32:13,578 --> 01:32:17,014
Sewer gas.

846
01:32:17,015 --> 01:32:22,015
Don't drop that!

847
01:33:07,031 --> 01:33:12,031
Play ball!

848
01:33:16,608 --> 01:33:19,843
Merry Christmas. Sparky.

849
01:33:19,844 --> 01:33:23,580
Merry Christmas. honey.

850
01:33:23,581 --> 01:33:28,581
Come here.

851
01:33:50,375 --> 01:33:55,375
I did it.

852
01:37:04,535 --> 01:37:09,535
