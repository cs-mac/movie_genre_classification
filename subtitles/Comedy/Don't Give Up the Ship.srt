1
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:43,204
<i>In the glorious addles of the United
States Navy have been many unsung heroes.</i>

2
00:01:44,956 --> 00:01:48,042
<i>Among them, John Paul Steckler I.</i>

3
00:01:48,459 --> 00:01:53,673
<i>Who, in the face of the British, uttered
the immortal words, "Follow me, men. "</i>

4
00:01:54,674 --> 00:01:56,050
Follow me, men!

5
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,931
<i>Fortunately, no one followed.</i>

6
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:05,226
<i>In the most famous naval
engagement of the Civil War</i>

7
00:02:05,393 --> 00:02:07,645
<i>another Steckler came to the fore.</i>

8
00:02:08,688 --> 00:02:11,149
<i>It was John Paul Steckler IV.</i>

9
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,067
<i>Aboard the iron clad
Monitor</i>

10
00:02:13,276 --> 00:02:16,320
<i>who first saw the Merrimac approaching
through the darkness.</i>

11
00:02:16,696 --> 00:02:19,740
<i>Someone had to bring this news
to the captain immediately.</i>

12
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:27,331
<i>Someone did.</i>

13
00:02:27,582 --> 00:02:28,708
<i>But not Steckler.</i>

14
00:02:32,712 --> 00:02:35,047
<i>For years there were no
Stecklers in uniform</i>

15
00:02:35,089 --> 00:02:37,216
<i>and everything went
pleasantly for the navy.</i>

16
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:40,761
<i>Then, John Paul Steckler</i>
<i>VII came along</i>.

17
00:02:42,054 --> 00:02:43,472
<i>And, wow!</i>

18
00:02:44,307 --> 00:02:45,308
Admiral Bludde.

19
00:02:46,225 --> 00:02:51,063
You're quite certain this officer was
last in command of the U.S.S. Conblatt?

20
00:02:58,821 --> 00:03:01,449
No doubt about it, sir. A
young fella named Stickler.

21
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:02,867
Uh, Steckler, sir.

22
00:03:03,284 --> 00:03:04,285
Uh, Steckler.

23
00:03:04,827 --> 00:03:05,870
Now, Congressman

24
00:03:06,245 --> 00:03:09,123
getting back to our appropriations
for the coming fiscal...

25
00:03:09,123 --> 00:03:10,541
In a moment, Admiral.

26
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:15,338
And did this Steckler sign out for
the Kornblatt at the end of the war?

27
00:03:15,546 --> 00:03:16,797
Yes, sir. Now...

28
00:03:17,173 --> 00:03:18,341
about our budget.

29
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:24,805
A 17 hundred ton, 306 foot
destroyer escort missing?

30
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:29,310
Well, if he signed out for it, where is it?

31
00:03:29,685 --> 00:03:30,686
Where?

32
00:03:30,853 --> 00:03:32,188
Uh, let's see, uh...

33
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,607
I'll tell you where it is. It's missing!

34
00:03:34,899 --> 00:03:37,443
Gone. Vanished from the face of the earth.

35
00:03:38,402 --> 00:03:40,780
Well, I'm sure we'll locate it, sir.

36
00:03:40,947 --> 00:03:43,532
You don't just lose a destroyer escort.

37
00:03:43,783 --> 00:03:44,784
Admiral.

38
00:03:44,909 --> 00:03:49,038
I don't have to tell you that if this
is a sample of naval housekeeping.

39
00:03:49,205 --> 00:03:53,751
It may have considerable effect on
the forthcoming appropriations bill.

40
00:03:55,044 --> 00:03:57,964
Will ten days be sufficient to find out?

41
00:03:58,673 --> 00:04:00,216
Oh, plenty, sir, plenty.

42
00:04:00,258 --> 00:04:02,051
We'll get right on it, sir.

43
00:04:02,051 --> 00:04:03,052
Good.

44
00:04:03,761 --> 00:04:04,762
Meet adjourned.

45
00:04:13,771 --> 00:04:14,897
We're in trouble.

46
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,025
If we don't find the Kornblatt, that...

47
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,863
Where's this officer stationed?

48
00:04:22,989 --> 00:04:24,699
Fourth naval district, Akron.

49
00:04:24,782 --> 00:04:26,242
Get him here right away.

50
00:04:26,325 --> 00:04:27,785
And don't tell anyone what its all about.

51
00:04:27,827 --> 00:04:28,828
Aye, aye, sir.

52
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:30,454
Look at that face, Joe.

53
00:04:30,538 --> 00:04:34,333
Behind those soft baby
eyes, that friendly smile

54
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:38,337
there could lurk the cunning
brain of a master criminal.

55
00:04:38,713 --> 00:04:41,590
Oh, just wait til I get my hands on...

56
00:04:41,841 --> 00:04:44,218
The happiest man in the world today.

57
00:04:47,138 --> 00:04:48,139
Poochie pie.

58
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:50,474
Sweetie face, to us.

59
00:04:57,231 --> 00:05:01,777
Mr. Steckler is a lieutenant in the navy.
Really very nice.

60
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:05,072
My daughter couldn't have done better.

61
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:07,450
Our first wedding cake.

62
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,788
For Judge Whipple, poochie.

63
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:15,583
Yes, darling, for Judge Poochie Whipple.

64
00:05:18,836 --> 00:05:19,837
Isn't this fun?

65
00:05:20,379 --> 00:05:22,214
Some day you'll get married, too.

66
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,759
I hope it's someone like
you, Admiral Steckler.

67
00:05:25,176 --> 00:05:27,178
Admiral. The child called...

68
00:05:27,428 --> 00:05:28,554
A lovely wedding.

69
00:05:29,096 --> 00:05:30,264
A lovely wedding.

70
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,809
And Prudence is a beautiful bride.

71
00:05:34,268 --> 00:05:35,895
Just beautiful.

72
00:05:37,521 --> 00:05:38,522
Well!

73
00:05:39,357 --> 00:05:41,192
Uh, oh, uh.

74
00:05:56,415 --> 00:05:58,000
Should we sneak out now, ducky poo?

75
00:05:58,209 --> 00:06:00,378
I think this would be a perfect time.

76
00:06:00,586 --> 00:06:03,547
Plus the fact I can't wait
til we're alone, sweetheart.

77
00:06:03,756 --> 00:06:04,757
Just think...

78
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:07,093
two weeks alone at Lake Wanapawawa.

79
00:06:08,094 --> 00:06:10,429
Fishing, canoeing, rowing.

80
00:06:10,554 --> 00:06:11,555
Everything.

81
00:06:19,021 --> 00:06:20,356
- John.
- Mother.

82
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:23,109
John, take care of my little girl.

83
00:06:23,484 --> 00:06:25,486
I will, Mother. I'll take care of her.

84
00:06:25,694 --> 00:06:27,321
Just like her father took care of you.

85
00:06:27,363 --> 00:06:29,907
That monster! Don't mention his name.

86
00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:32,326
- I'm sorry. Goodbye, Mother.
- Why, when I think of that...

87
00:06:32,368 --> 00:06:33,452
Goodbye, Mother!

88
00:06:35,121 --> 00:06:37,373
Have a happy honeymoon, darlings!

89
00:06:37,748 --> 00:06:38,833
Happy honeymoon!

90
00:06:39,667 --> 00:06:41,043
All swords!

91
00:06:44,088 --> 00:06:45,089
Swords!

92
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,814
That's our man! Follow him!

93
00:07:15,327 --> 00:07:16,412
Lieutenant Steckler?

94
00:07:16,454 --> 00:07:17,413
Yes, sir, the seventh.

95
00:07:17,496 --> 00:07:19,415
I'm Lieutenant Commander Farber.
I hate to do this to you,

96
00:07:19,415 --> 00:07:21,250
old man, but you're wanted
in Washington immediately.

97
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:21,709
What?

98
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,837
Red phone call, special orders deliver
you no later than 15 hundred today.

99
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,715
But you can't! We're just
leaving on our honeymoon.

100
00:07:27,756 --> 00:07:29,633
Wait, sweetheart, let me explain.
I don't think you

101
00:07:29,675 --> 00:07:32,219
understand, Commander, you
see we were just married.

102
00:07:33,345 --> 00:07:35,264
We're going on our honeymoon.

103
00:07:35,556 --> 00:07:37,016
- I'm on leave!
- It's been canceled.

104
00:07:37,016 --> 00:07:38,517
- Who canceled?
- Admiral Bludde.

105
00:07:38,601 --> 00:07:39,602
Admiral Bludde.

106
00:07:39,852 --> 00:07:41,604
His plane is waiting for
you at the airport.

107
00:07:41,604 --> 00:07:44,940
But, we've got the honeymoon cottage
at Lake Winnepawawa for two weeks.

108
00:07:45,024 --> 00:07:48,444
Wait, sweetheart Prudence,
please dear, let me handle this.

109
00:07:48,611 --> 00:07:50,613
Commander, what would the
Admiral want with me?

110
00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:53,365
I don't know, but here are your orders.

111
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,577
- It is the Admiral.
- What does he want?

112
00:07:56,785 --> 00:07:59,455
Well, it doesn't say, but
that's his signature.

113
00:07:59,914 --> 00:08:01,457
Gee, my old commander.

114
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:03,918
- The top destroyer...
- Lieutenant, I hate to rush you.

115
00:08:04,043 --> 00:08:05,044
Yeah, well!

116
00:08:06,003 --> 00:08:08,339
Bludde or no Bludde, Admiral or no.

117
00:08:09,757 --> 00:08:11,884
Although, it might be a decoration.

118
00:08:11,967 --> 00:08:15,221
- You know, there was that skirmish...
- Can't he mail it to you?

119
00:08:16,555 --> 00:08:18,307
No, dear. If I'm going to
get a medal I think the

120
00:08:18,349 --> 00:08:20,559
least we can do is go to
Washington and pick it up.

121
00:08:21,685 --> 00:08:22,686
A medal.

122
00:08:22,895 --> 00:08:24,438
My hero.

123
00:08:24,772 --> 00:08:26,982
Now, we can have our
honeymoon in Washington.

124
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:29,568
Just like George and Martha.

125
00:08:32,863 --> 00:08:34,448
Lieutenant, if you will.

126
00:09:11,944 --> 00:09:13,195
Mission accomplished, sir.

127
00:09:13,529 --> 00:09:16,407
- Lieutenant John Paul Steckler?
- The seventh.

128
00:09:18,534 --> 00:09:19,660
This way, please.

129
00:09:39,471 --> 00:09:43,017
Lieutenant John Paul Steckler
VII reporting as ordered, sir.

130
00:09:43,267 --> 00:09:44,518
So, you're the man.

131
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,729
I guess so, sir.

132
00:09:47,563 --> 00:09:48,564
Amazing.

133
00:09:48,814 --> 00:09:50,024
How did you do it?

134
00:09:50,065 --> 00:09:52,151
- Oh, it was nothing.
- Nothing?

135
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:55,195
- Well, what I mean to say, sir...
- Tell us, son.

136
00:09:55,321 --> 00:09:56,905
Did you do this on your own?

137
00:09:57,197 --> 00:09:58,574
Or, were there others?

138
00:09:58,657 --> 00:09:59,742
Well, sir, uh...

139
00:10:00,534 --> 00:10:02,828
Is anyone ever really on their own?

140
00:10:02,995 --> 00:10:05,372
I mean what I'm trying to say, sir, is...

141
00:10:05,581 --> 00:10:07,791
Doesn't everything always depend on...

142
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,837
the men you serve with? Their
cooperation, their loyalty?

143
00:10:12,796 --> 00:10:15,674
See what I told you, Joe? Nerves of steel.

144
00:10:15,966 --> 00:10:17,635
We're lucky there's only one missing.

145
00:10:17,885 --> 00:10:19,678
So, you admit you had help.

146
00:10:20,262 --> 00:10:21,930
Oh, yes, sir. In everything I did, sir.

147
00:10:22,598 --> 00:10:26,393
After all, I had a shining inspiration.
I served under Admiral Bludde.

148
00:10:26,477 --> 00:10:27,936
Are you trying to pin this on me?

149
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,397
Oh oh, no sir. I thought you
were going to pin it on me.

150
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:33,317
As a matter of fact, I wish you
would because my wife is...

151
00:10:33,692 --> 00:10:34,693
Excuse me, sir.

152
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:36,445
Are you mad at me?

153
00:10:36,612 --> 00:10:37,613
Mad at you?

154
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:39,740
Nonsense.

155
00:10:43,661 --> 00:10:45,496
All I want is a full confession!

156
00:10:45,621 --> 00:10:46,622
Confession?

157
00:10:47,498 --> 00:10:48,499
Sir.

158
00:10:48,707 --> 00:10:51,126
As representative of the
Judge Advocate General

159
00:10:51,293 --> 00:10:55,839
I request Lieutenant Steckler be formally
advised of the charges against him.

160
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,424
The char..ch...

161
00:10:57,758 --> 00:10:59,009
Did he say charges?

162
00:10:59,218 --> 00:11:00,219
Certainly.

163
00:11:00,552 --> 00:11:03,555
Why do you think you were called?
To receive a medal?

164
00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:06,725
Well, very honestly sir,
I did think I was...

165
00:11:06,934 --> 00:11:08,227
Maybe a little one.

166
00:11:09,353 --> 00:11:10,813
I've never seen anyone like him.

167
00:11:11,105 --> 00:11:12,898
Go ahead commander, read the charges.

168
00:11:13,107 --> 00:11:16,485
- Lieutenant John Paul Steckler.
- The seventh, sir.

169
00:11:17,528 --> 00:11:20,989
Lieutenant John Paul Steckler VII?

170
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:25,536
My brother was supposed to be the seventh,
but he turned out to be my sister.

171
00:11:26,704 --> 00:11:30,290
- See, they were expecting a boy...
- Read the charges!

172
00:11:32,376 --> 00:11:33,377
Lieutenant...

173
00:11:33,544 --> 00:11:37,589
during World War II, some government
property charged out to you

174
00:11:37,756 --> 00:11:41,093
and for which you're therefor
responsible, was not turned in.

175
00:11:41,885 --> 00:11:43,137
It's still missing.

176
00:11:43,595 --> 00:11:46,557
Well, just a minute, Commander,
sir, I never took anything in my...

177
00:11:47,057 --> 00:11:49,059
What's the matter, Lieutenant?

178
00:11:49,435 --> 00:11:50,894
Nothing. Nothing, sir.

179
00:11:52,104 --> 00:11:54,523
It's just that I, I never
thought it'd be missed.

180
00:11:54,648 --> 00:11:56,734
Everyone was taking souvenirs.

181
00:11:57,151 --> 00:11:58,152
Weren't they?

182
00:11:58,569 --> 00:12:01,739
Wouldn't you say you went just
a little too far, Lieutenant?

183
00:12:01,947 --> 00:12:06,034
No, I don't think so, sir. I
mean, it wasn't important stuff.

184
00:12:06,535 --> 00:12:09,204
Well, it was my compass, sexton...

185
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:13,250
and patented Spam opener.

186
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:15,961
Wasn't there something else, Lieutenant?

187
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:18,297
Alright, I'm not gonna lie.

188
00:12:18,881 --> 00:12:22,551
I'm guilty and I think the best
thing for me to do is just

189
00:12:22,634 --> 00:12:24,845
pay up and get this thing over with.

190
00:12:24,928 --> 00:12:28,265
So, if you'll tell me how
much it is, I'll pay.

191
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:30,851
Tell him, Commander.

192
00:12:30,976 --> 00:12:32,853
The total amount comes to...

193
00:12:33,645 --> 00:12:40,652
Five million, four hundred and fifteen thousand,
nine hundred and twenty five dollars.

194
00:12:53,248 --> 00:12:54,500
Wh..wha...

195
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:57,252
I think he's trying to ask you something.

196
00:13:00,005 --> 00:13:01,089
What did I take?

197
00:13:02,132 --> 00:13:03,759
One fully equipped...

198
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:06,512
sea-worthy and battle-ready...

199
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:08,305
destroyer escort.

200
00:13:09,973 --> 00:13:11,183
Oh, come now, son.

201
00:13:11,767 --> 00:13:13,977
Your government doesn't
want to be tough on you.

202
00:13:14,061 --> 00:13:15,395
But, just tell us...

203
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:17,648
what did you do with the U.S.S. Kornblatt?

204
00:13:17,731 --> 00:13:18,857
I didn't take it.

205
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:20,609
I didn't take her.

206
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,569
I haven't got her.

207
00:13:22,694 --> 00:13:23,695
Honest.

208
00:13:24,363 --> 00:13:26,156
Pinky swear. Scout's honor.

209
00:13:26,698 --> 00:13:28,116
Where would I ever...

210
00:13:28,617 --> 00:13:29,618
I didn't...

211
00:13:31,245 --> 00:13:32,246
Honest.

212
00:13:35,249 --> 00:13:36,583
Frisk me!

213
00:14:03,694 --> 00:14:05,112
Five million dollars.

214
00:14:06,029 --> 00:14:08,699
How can I ever pay five million dollars?

215
00:14:09,658 --> 00:14:10,993
Even if they took...

216
00:14:11,368 --> 00:14:13,203
thirty dollars a month it would take...

217
00:14:13,412 --> 00:14:15,998
nine hundred and fifty thousand months.

218
00:14:17,124 --> 00:14:20,711
Thirty dollars into nine
hundred and fifty thousand...

219
00:14:21,003 --> 00:14:23,005
Oh, I forgot to carry the one.

220
00:14:24,756 --> 00:14:26,091
Five million into...

221
00:14:26,842 --> 00:14:30,220
Thirty, even if they start with
this month, the thirty dollars...

222
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,265
I don't think I have enough.

223
00:14:33,432 --> 00:14:36,560
It's twenty nine dollars
for the bus tickets...

224
00:14:37,978 --> 00:14:39,438
Let me see how much...

225
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:40,981
maybe...

226
00:14:43,066 --> 00:14:44,067
Five million..

227
00:14:44,192 --> 00:14:45,193
Hear that?

228
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,697
He thinks he's got five million
dollars in small change.

229
00:14:48,822 --> 00:14:50,866
Oh, the old "insanity" gimmick.

230
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,870
- Well, he's not going to get away with it.
- Shall we question him again, sir?

231
00:14:55,454 --> 00:14:56,622
Lieutenant Steckler.

232
00:14:56,705 --> 00:14:57,706
The seventh.

233
00:14:58,457 --> 00:14:59,458
Oh.

234
00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:02,210
Yes, sir.

235
00:15:02,628 --> 00:15:04,963
I must confess that until
this moment I thought

236
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:06,882
you might have snatched the Kornblatt.

237
00:15:07,549 --> 00:15:12,137
That behind the facade of innocence was
the shrewd, calculating brain of a crook.

238
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:15,265
Or a master spy in pay of some foreign...

239
00:15:15,307 --> 00:15:19,478
Oh, just a minute, sir. If you
don't mind, sir. I am not a spy.

240
00:15:19,811 --> 00:15:22,981
I mean I've goofed and all
that, but I am not a traitor.

241
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:25,400
I mean the navy is my whole life.

242
00:15:25,484 --> 00:15:27,069
Before I was in the navy I was just...

243
00:15:27,361 --> 00:15:28,612
John Paul Steckler.

244
00:15:29,404 --> 00:15:30,405
The meatball.

245
00:15:31,031 --> 00:15:33,951
But now, Lieutenant John Paul Steckler!

246
00:15:34,618 --> 00:15:35,619
The meatball.

247
00:15:35,661 --> 00:15:36,662
Steckler...

248
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,747
I'm beginning to feel sorry for you.

249
00:15:38,914 --> 00:15:39,748
Thank you.

250
00:15:39,831 --> 00:15:42,042
I've seen enough scared
young men to know that...

251
00:15:42,626 --> 00:15:43,627
you're another.

252
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:46,588
- But, you're in a way of a lot of trouble.
- Yes, sir.

253
00:15:47,172 --> 00:15:50,384
Nobody really wants to
kick you out of the navy.

254
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:52,260
Throw you in jail.

255
00:15:52,761 --> 00:15:54,596
See you wind up in disgrace.

256
00:15:55,806 --> 00:16:00,018
But, the last name the Kornblatt was checked
out to was enson John Paul Steckler.

257
00:16:00,394 --> 00:16:02,562
We've got to pin it on somebody.

258
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:06,400
Sir?

259
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:08,819
How about him, sir?

260
00:16:09,236 --> 00:16:10,237
Steckler!

261
00:16:11,947 --> 00:16:13,073
Give up the ship!

262
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,242
I haven't got her, sir.

263
00:16:15,325 --> 00:16:17,244
- Well, then find her!
- Yes, sir.

264
00:16:17,452 --> 00:16:18,704
- You've got ten days.
- Yes, sir.

265
00:16:18,704 --> 00:16:20,580
- And you better come back with something.
- Yes, sir.

266
00:16:20,956 --> 00:16:22,249
- Commander.
- Yes, sir.

267
00:16:22,499 --> 00:16:24,292
Get the duplicate records
of all ships turned in.

268
00:16:24,292 --> 00:16:26,086
Pacific fleet 1945 to date.

269
00:16:26,169 --> 00:16:27,170
All of them?

270
00:16:27,295 --> 00:16:28,296
Yes, sir!

271
00:16:30,173 --> 00:16:30,966
Steckler?

272
00:16:31,008 --> 00:16:33,635
I want you to spend the next 12 hours
sifting through those records.

273
00:16:33,844 --> 00:16:35,929
We've got to find the Kornblatt!

274
00:16:35,971 --> 00:16:37,055
And we're starting tonight.

275
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:38,849
Tonight? But, I had plans tonight sir!

276
00:16:38,849 --> 00:16:40,517
- Cancel all plans!
- Yes, sir!

277
00:16:40,517 --> 00:16:44,813
If we don't come up with the Kornblatt
inside of ten days, the navy

278
00:16:44,813 --> 00:16:47,899
stands to lose four billion
dollars in appropriations.

279
00:16:48,191 --> 00:16:52,529
This is vital, Steckler. As America's
first line of defense, I...

280
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,158
Who's ducky poo?

281
00:17:02,706 --> 00:17:05,208
Hello. Everything comfy cozy, dear?

282
00:17:05,751 --> 00:17:09,171
Ducky poo, I've been waiting three hours.

283
00:17:09,379 --> 00:17:12,674
And I can't wait to see you, sweetie face.

284
00:17:14,176 --> 00:17:17,220
I don't speak to everyone that way, sir.
I hope you don't think so. Just my wife.

285
00:17:17,262 --> 00:17:18,346
Hang up that phone!

286
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:21,183
I'm a have, I'm a have, I'm a
have to hang up now, dear.

287
00:17:22,059 --> 00:17:23,310
Tell me you wuv me.

288
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:27,981
Wuv you, wuv you, wuv you, wuv you.

289
00:17:28,023 --> 00:17:29,691
- Hang up!
- Yes, sir!

290
00:17:30,901 --> 00:17:31,902
Wuv you.

291
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:37,574
- The records, sir.
- Good.

292
00:17:37,824 --> 00:17:38,825
Thank you.

293
00:17:40,035 --> 00:17:41,745
Steckler, get at those right away.

294
00:17:41,787 --> 00:17:43,246
Yes, sir. I will, sir.

295
00:17:43,371 --> 00:17:45,874
Oh, I'm sorry, sir. Excuse me.

296
00:17:46,374 --> 00:17:47,709
I'm very sorry, sir.

297
00:17:49,127 --> 00:17:50,128
My cap, sir.

298
00:17:57,302 --> 00:17:58,095
Thank you, sir.

299
00:17:58,136 --> 00:18:00,514
And be back here at 0900 tomorrow morning.

300
00:18:00,597 --> 00:18:02,724
Yes, sir! 0900 tomorrow morning!

301
00:18:04,601 --> 00:18:07,062
That's a tough break, sir, having this
happen right in the middle of his honeymoon.

302
00:18:07,145 --> 00:18:08,146
Honeymoon?

303
00:18:08,188 --> 00:18:09,481
He was married this morning, sir.

304
00:18:09,606 --> 00:18:12,234
Oh, no. The honeymoon will have to wait.

305
00:18:12,317 --> 00:18:14,903
See that he's checked into the bachelor
officer's quarters for the night.

306
00:18:14,945 --> 00:18:16,279
I'll arrange it sir.

307
00:18:16,404 --> 00:18:17,405
Alright, gentlemen, that's all.

308
00:18:19,825 --> 00:18:21,201
Will there be anything else?

309
00:18:21,451 --> 00:18:24,329
Oh, you'd better bring
another bottle of champagne. Pink.

310
00:18:24,454 --> 00:18:26,248
Pink. Yes, madam.

311
00:18:49,813 --> 00:18:51,898
- Did you miss me, honey?
- Yes.

312
00:18:52,065 --> 00:18:54,276
- Oh, darn it.
- What in the world?

313
00:18:54,818 --> 00:18:58,405
Now I've got the San Diego D.E.'s all
mixed up with the Bremington C.E.V.'s.

314
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:00,448
What are these, ducky poo.

315
00:19:01,074 --> 00:19:02,868
Oh, Admiral Bludde gave them to me.

316
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:04,411
Instead of a medal?

317
00:19:04,452 --> 00:19:06,454
- There is no medal.
- No medal?

318
00:19:06,663 --> 00:19:08,707
No and there's no Kornblatt, either.

319
00:19:08,707 --> 00:19:10,333
What's a Kornblatt?

320
00:19:11,418 --> 00:19:14,421
Honey, don't you remember
I used to tell you

321
00:19:14,963 --> 00:19:18,925
about during the war I commanded
the U.S.S. Kornblatt?

322
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:20,719
Well, that's a Kornblatt.

323
00:19:20,844 --> 00:19:22,429
And it's missing, and...

324
00:19:22,971 --> 00:19:24,306
they said I took it.

325
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:27,267
You? What would you do with a battleship?

326
00:19:27,475 --> 00:19:29,227
What would anybody do with a battleship?

327
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:31,813
No, honey, she's not a battleship.

328
00:19:32,022 --> 00:19:34,232
It's a destroyer escort, you see.

329
00:19:34,357 --> 00:19:36,401
And, although I didn't take it...

330
00:19:36,568 --> 00:19:38,069
I'm responsible for it.

331
00:19:38,528 --> 00:19:41,948
Well, let's not worry
about a silly old boat.

332
00:19:42,532 --> 00:19:44,367
Not tonight, anyway.

333
00:19:48,246 --> 00:19:49,247
Nope.

334
00:19:49,331 --> 00:19:50,332
Not tonight.

335
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,961
Honey?

336
00:19:55,086 --> 00:19:57,005
Should I wear the white
pajamas with the black

337
00:19:57,047 --> 00:19:59,257
stripes or the black pajamas
with the white stripes?

338
00:19:59,257 --> 00:20:01,092
Oh, either one sweetie.

339
00:20:01,259 --> 00:20:03,178
Alright, I'll mix them up.

340
00:20:03,845 --> 00:20:06,389
Who needs Lake Winnepawawa?

341
00:20:06,473 --> 00:20:10,769
Anyplace is heaven when
you're with your poochie pie.

342
00:20:15,565 --> 00:20:16,566
Prudence.

343
00:20:18,193 --> 00:20:20,195
You're absolutely beautiful.

344
00:20:20,487 --> 00:20:22,197
It's about time you noticed.

345
00:20:22,197 --> 00:20:24,157
Well, I noticed right from
the start, sweetheart. I

346
00:20:24,199 --> 00:20:26,785
just didn't want you to
think that I was stuck on you.

347
00:20:29,287 --> 00:20:31,539
Oh, champagne.

348
00:20:31,665 --> 00:20:35,126
Caviar. Pheasant under glass.

349
00:20:36,294 --> 00:20:41,007
Oh, is this a way to spend a wedding night.

350
00:20:45,553 --> 00:20:47,472
Wait til you see the dessert.

351
00:20:48,056 --> 00:20:49,057
Dessert?

352
00:20:49,307 --> 00:20:50,308
Where?

353
00:20:50,809 --> 00:20:52,936
It's not over there, Lieutenant.

354
00:21:01,194 --> 00:21:04,197
- I love you, Prudence.
- I love you, darling.

355
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:06,574
But, I'm in big trouble.

356
00:21:07,951 --> 00:21:12,414
You are if you turn that light
on again, my itsy bitsy baby.

357
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:17,711
Well, now to worksy worksy.

358
00:21:17,752 --> 00:21:19,129
Worksy worksy?

359
00:21:19,254 --> 00:21:22,173
Yes, sweetheart. I promised the Admiral
that I'd go through these records.

360
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,050
On our honeymoon?

361
00:21:24,175 --> 00:21:26,761
Well, I'm going to help you.
It's a wife's duty.

362
00:21:27,178 --> 00:21:28,179
Yes, you help, dear.

363
00:21:28,638 --> 00:21:30,390
Now, let's see. I might...

364
00:21:30,682 --> 00:21:34,352
I might as well start back in 1945.
Oh, here's...

365
00:21:34,602 --> 00:21:36,855
Here's something very interesting.

366
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:40,233
106,210 tons of ships in dry dock.

367
00:21:40,275 --> 00:21:43,486
Oh, you have the cutest little ears.

368
00:21:43,653 --> 00:21:46,448
Ears in dry... Darling I can't concentrate.

369
00:21:47,532 --> 00:21:48,491
Now...

370
00:21:48,575 --> 00:21:52,203
- Honey, I've got work to do.
- Oh, you certainly have.

371
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:57,876
Let me explain, dear. You see there's
this Congressman Mandeville.

372
00:21:57,917 --> 00:22:00,712
Now, he's the head of the House
Appropriations Committee.

373
00:22:00,712 --> 00:22:03,590
- Oh, you say the sweetest things.
- Well...

374
00:22:05,467 --> 00:22:07,594
The Navy needs money for
money for new ships, see,

375
00:22:07,635 --> 00:22:09,637
and he's looking for an
excuse to turn them down.

376
00:22:09,846 --> 00:22:10,930
Now, the Korn...

377
00:22:13,767 --> 00:22:14,768
blatt.

378
00:22:14,809 --> 00:22:17,270
Now, if the Navy can't keep
track of the ships that it has

379
00:22:17,437 --> 00:22:20,940
then he's not going to let Congress give
the Navy any more money to buy new ships.

380
00:22:20,982 --> 00:22:24,402
And that's why Admiral
Bludde is out to drink mine.

381
00:22:26,237 --> 00:22:28,031
You are in trouble.

382
00:22:28,239 --> 00:22:29,783
Yeah, very big trouble.

383
00:22:30,158 --> 00:22:32,077
That's why I feel so bad
bringing you all the way

384
00:22:32,118 --> 00:22:34,079
to Washington thinking I
was going to get a medal.

385
00:22:34,454 --> 00:22:35,914
The night's young yet.

386
00:22:36,206 --> 00:22:38,083
Maybe you still will.

387
00:22:39,209 --> 00:22:42,212
- I love you, Prudence.
- I love you, darling.

388
00:22:45,006 --> 00:22:46,007
What's that?

389
00:22:46,466 --> 00:22:48,009
I didn't hear anything.

390
00:22:48,093 --> 00:22:49,636
Oh, it's the champagne.

391
00:22:50,095 --> 00:22:51,346
I can hear it fizz.

392
00:22:51,638 --> 00:22:54,057
It's the waiter with more champagne.

393
00:22:55,683 --> 00:22:57,477
More champagne.

394
00:22:58,436 --> 00:22:59,896
More champagne.

395
00:23:01,064 --> 00:23:03,566
I hope it's pink champagne!

396
00:23:03,608 --> 00:23:04,609
It is!

397
00:23:04,818 --> 00:23:06,152
Goody, goody, goody!

398
00:23:06,194 --> 00:23:07,195
What'd he say?

399
00:23:07,278 --> 00:23:08,613
Goody, goody, goody.

400
00:23:09,114 --> 00:23:11,116
- Lieutenant Steckler?
- The seventh.

401
00:23:11,366 --> 00:23:13,368
But, this room is occupied.

402
00:23:13,701 --> 00:23:16,121
Here you, man, just a minute!
You're out of bounds!

403
00:23:16,162 --> 00:23:18,832
Orders from the Admiral, sir.
Got a staff car waiting.

404
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,667
- You're to come with us.
- Come with you?

405
00:23:20,667 --> 00:23:22,252
Wait just a minute, darling.
I'll take care of this.

406
00:23:22,293 --> 00:23:25,213
I don't think you understand, gentlemen. You
see, we were just married this morning.

407
00:23:25,255 --> 00:23:26,172
- Lot's of luck.
- Thank you.

408
00:23:26,214 --> 00:23:29,676
Sir, now if you'll get ready,
sir, we'll drop you off at B.O.Q.

409
00:23:29,717 --> 00:23:32,178
- B.O.Q.?
- Bachelor Officer's Quarters, ma'am.

410
00:23:32,178 --> 00:23:36,307
Is this all the Navy has to do? Run
around breaking up honeymoons?

411
00:23:36,307 --> 00:23:38,059
Why aren't you men out sailing ships?

412
00:23:38,184 --> 00:23:41,980
Darling, please. I'm sorry, but
they're just following orders, that's all.

413
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,982
But, you're not a bachelor. Tell them.

414
00:23:44,023 --> 00:23:48,194
Well, technically I am. I, no I'm
not a bachelor! There, I told them.

415
00:23:48,236 --> 00:23:49,946
Sorry, Mrs. Steckler. Orders are orders.

416
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:52,490
And you wasted all this time talking.

417
00:23:52,615 --> 00:23:55,034
Well, honey. I mean, no, she's honey.
Sweetheart.

418
00:23:55,118 --> 00:23:57,078
Sweet, I'll tell
sweet... Would you wait?

419
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,874
I'm... Honey! Just, I'm... Excuse
me, men for a sec, I...

420
00:24:00,999 --> 00:24:02,000
Dear.

421
00:24:02,584 --> 00:24:05,545
Let me explain, dear. Is it my fault
that the Kornblatt is missing?

422
00:24:05,628 --> 00:24:08,089
- We've got to snap it up, sir.
- And on the double! Yes, sir!

423
00:24:08,214 --> 00:24:11,801
Here we go! Honey, really, bear
with me, dear. This is a prob...

424
00:24:11,885 --> 00:24:15,597
Thank you very much, dear. Please, honey. I'm
awfully sorry, but this is not my fault.

425
00:24:15,638 --> 00:24:16,723
- These are orders, dear.
- Oh, honey!

426
00:24:16,806 --> 00:24:19,976
Oh, don't feel bad sweetheart, because
this is something that just has to be.

427
00:24:20,018 --> 00:24:23,188
You just relax and I'll
call you at eight bells.

428
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:28,651
Keep it on ice.

429
00:24:33,907 --> 00:24:35,408
I'm stumped, Steckler.

430
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,912
I don't really believe you could
lose a ship like the Kornblatt.

431
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:41,873
Because I don't believe you would ever
be put in command of the Kornblatt.

432
00:24:42,624 --> 00:24:44,459
But, if you were, then you could.

433
00:24:44,584 --> 00:24:46,211
Oh, I was, but I didn't.

434
00:24:47,003 --> 00:24:48,087
You didn't what?

435
00:24:48,296 --> 00:24:49,714
I mean I didn't, sir.

436
00:24:50,673 --> 00:24:52,008
We're not giving up.

437
00:24:53,009 --> 00:24:55,553
Report to the office of Naval
Intelligence immediately.

438
00:24:55,803 --> 00:24:58,515
I've assigned one of the best
young officers to help you out.

439
00:24:58,556 --> 00:24:59,474
Yes, sir.

440
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:00,600
Enson Benson.

441
00:25:00,683 --> 00:25:03,228
Yes. Crackerjack mind. Smart as a whip.

442
00:25:03,895 --> 00:25:07,357
Remember, Steckler. We have
only nine days. No more.

443
00:25:07,774 --> 00:25:10,652
Alright? Now, batten down the hatches.
Full speed ahead.

444
00:25:10,735 --> 00:25:13,404
Batten down the hatches,
full speed ahead. Yes, sir!

445
00:25:13,571 --> 00:25:14,572
Um.

446
00:25:14,864 --> 00:25:16,115
Oh, excuse me, sir.

447
00:25:16,574 --> 00:25:18,618
May I make a call? I
promised the little woman...

448
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,203
- Shove off!
- Yes, sir.

449
00:25:30,129 --> 00:25:31,130
How?

450
00:25:31,798 --> 00:25:33,132
How did we ever win?

451
00:25:39,931 --> 00:25:41,516
Top secret area.

452
00:25:59,576 --> 00:26:00,577
Well?

453
00:26:03,746 --> 00:26:04,747
What is it?

454
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:06,291
Who are you?

455
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:18,761
Come, come, man, speak up!

456
00:26:19,637 --> 00:26:21,514
Lieutenant Steckler repor...

457
00:26:25,977 --> 00:26:27,770
I told you it was a secret.

458
00:26:28,062 --> 00:26:30,064
The enson is expecting you.

459
00:26:30,273 --> 00:26:31,274
This way.

460
00:26:57,884 --> 00:26:59,594
How do you do, Lieutenant?

461
00:27:00,803 --> 00:27:03,348
En-Enson B-Benson?

462
00:27:03,556 --> 00:27:04,557
That's right.

463
00:27:07,769 --> 00:27:09,896
Lieutenant John Paul Stellman...

464
00:27:09,979 --> 00:27:11,314
Paul John Stallet...

465
00:27:13,066 --> 00:27:15,026
Paul Paul Stalfer.

466
00:27:15,193 --> 00:27:18,237
- Steckler.
- Steckler, that's it! Harry Steckler. No!

467
00:27:18,488 --> 00:27:22,533
Sit down, Lieutenant. Please
make yourself comfortable.

468
00:27:23,868 --> 00:27:24,869
Thank you.

469
00:27:27,455 --> 00:27:28,831
They let you keep secrets?

470
00:27:28,998 --> 00:27:29,999
Of course. Why?

471
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:31,751
Oh, oh nothing.

472
00:27:32,168 --> 00:27:35,129
It's, it's just that you look like
a girl that has nothing to hide.

473
00:27:35,213 --> 00:27:35,755
Hmm?

474
00:27:35,755 --> 00:27:38,675
No, I don't, what I
mean to say is, that if the Korn..

475
00:27:38,841 --> 00:27:41,636
Kornblatt were built anything like
you they'd a never lost it.

476
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:44,639
Uh, no, what I'm trying to say is...

477
00:27:44,639 --> 00:27:46,641
I don't know what they're putting
together over there in Russia

478
00:27:46,641 --> 00:27:49,560
but whatever it it, we're
way ahead of them.

479
00:27:53,523 --> 00:27:56,776
Lieutenant, I know you're the victim
of one of the biggest boo boos in the

480
00:27:56,818 --> 00:27:58,277
history of the U.S. Navy.

481
00:27:58,319 --> 00:27:59,320
Yeah, I am.

482
00:27:59,445 --> 00:28:01,280
I've looked over your
record and it's spotless.

483
00:28:01,364 --> 00:28:04,117
You've always had the utmost
concern for government property.

484
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,869
Well, well I always did try my best.

485
00:28:07,286 --> 00:28:11,582
Except maybe just that one time
when I painted my sea bag all red.

486
00:28:11,666 --> 00:28:13,584
And cut the two holes in
the bottom for my feet.

487
00:28:13,626 --> 00:28:14,293
Your feet?

488
00:28:14,293 --> 00:28:17,296
Well, it was a Halloween party. You
see, I went as a skinless frankfurter.

489
00:28:17,422 --> 00:28:19,632
As a... I see.

490
00:28:21,217 --> 00:28:22,719
- Lieutenant...
- I won first prize!

491
00:28:22,844 --> 00:28:25,638
- How nice.
- It was a case of skinless frankfurters.

492
00:28:25,805 --> 00:28:28,307
- That was a coincidence.
- I was very lucky.

493
00:28:29,183 --> 00:28:32,311
- Now, Lieutenant, let's review the facts.
- Anything!

494
00:28:32,395 --> 00:28:35,565
We're going to be working pretty
closely together, and I...

495
00:28:36,274 --> 00:28:39,986
That's all well and good, Enson, it's
very nice and I might like that, but...

496
00:28:40,528 --> 00:28:41,529
I'm married.

497
00:28:41,821 --> 00:28:43,614
I know! What I meant was...

498
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:47,076
How is Prudence?

499
00:28:47,201 --> 00:28:49,203
- Who?
- Prudence. Your wife.

500
00:28:49,996 --> 00:28:54,250
Oh, oh the one I'm married to. Oh,
Prudence, she's fine. Thank you.

501
00:28:54,917 --> 00:28:59,213
Well, what I started to say was, we'll
be working pretty closely together

502
00:28:59,213 --> 00:29:02,383
and I thought perhaps we might
dispense with the usual formalities.

503
00:29:02,425 --> 00:29:05,470
Thank you very much, Enson.
That's a very good idea.

504
00:29:05,887 --> 00:29:08,848
We can relax that way.
You can call me John.

505
00:29:09,265 --> 00:29:10,641
And I can call you...

506
00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:12,560
Enson Benson?

507
00:29:13,478 --> 00:29:15,938
- Rita.
- Rita. Oh, that's nice.

508
00:29:16,147 --> 00:29:18,149
I once had a parrot I called Rita.

509
00:29:18,316 --> 00:29:19,317
It hated me.

510
00:29:20,067 --> 00:29:21,694
It's real name was Frank.

511
00:29:22,862 --> 00:29:23,863
Frank!

512
00:29:28,075 --> 00:29:31,579
Uh, say, Enson it's strange,
but how do you know

513
00:29:31,621 --> 00:29:34,373
so much about my wife,
Prudence, and myself?

514
00:29:34,874 --> 00:29:37,668
Oh, I know lots of things about you, John.

515
00:29:38,211 --> 00:29:39,712
Practically everything.

516
00:29:40,838 --> 00:29:46,093
Everything except what happened to
the Kornblatt. Why don't you fill me in?

517
00:29:47,053 --> 00:29:48,054
Can we talk?

518
00:29:48,137 --> 00:29:49,138
Yes.

519
00:29:56,896 --> 00:29:57,897
Rita.

520
00:29:58,272 --> 00:30:02,068
If I knew anything, wouldn't
you be the first to tell me?

521
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:05,238
Well, since you put it that way.

522
00:30:05,571 --> 00:30:10,993
Well, we'll see. Now, if you'll just come
with me, Lieutenant we can get started.

523
00:30:12,036 --> 00:30:14,789
- Where are we going?
- Operation Snaggle.

524
00:30:22,338 --> 00:30:24,423
There now. Do you like waltzes?

525
00:30:25,091 --> 00:30:28,261
Oh, yes, I love 'em, but
I'm too upset to dance.

526
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,180
This is therapy, John.

527
00:30:31,722 --> 00:30:33,975
Just to soothe you, get you relaxed.

528
00:30:33,975 --> 00:30:35,726
- Uh huh.
- Comfortable?

529
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:37,520
Yes, very.

530
00:30:37,562 --> 00:30:40,189
You can take your shoes off if you like.

531
00:30:41,107 --> 00:30:42,108
Oh, thank you.

532
00:30:43,276 --> 00:30:45,069
I won't be as tall, though.

533
00:30:45,236 --> 00:30:47,321
I just want you to be completely relaxed.

534
00:30:47,738 --> 00:30:48,906
Now, stretch out.

535
00:30:51,242 --> 00:30:52,368
Anything you say.

536
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:58,749
Not on the floor, John. On the chair.

537
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:02,420
On the chair. I'm sorry. Thank you.

538
00:31:03,212 --> 00:31:04,338
You're very kind.

539
00:31:06,424 --> 00:31:07,884
Hey, this is peaceful.

540
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:12,013
I've never been this comfortable before.

541
00:31:12,138 --> 00:31:13,681
Relax, John!

542
00:31:13,681 --> 00:31:15,558
- Yes.
- Relax.

543
00:31:18,269 --> 00:31:19,270
How's that?

544
00:31:19,645 --> 00:31:20,646
Oh, yummy.

545
00:31:22,189 --> 00:31:24,692
Now, I want you to tell
me everything you can

546
00:31:24,734 --> 00:31:27,737
remember about the Kornblatt.
Everything.

547
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:30,698
- Now, concentrate, John.
- Yeah.

548
00:31:30,823 --> 00:31:32,241
- Go back.
- Back.

549
00:31:32,617 --> 00:31:35,786
Far, far back.
Far, far back.

550
00:31:35,828 --> 00:31:37,038
Yeah, I'm going back.

551
00:31:37,246 --> 00:31:38,247
Back, back.

552
00:31:38,748 --> 00:31:41,417
Back, very far, far, far back.

553
00:31:41,459 --> 00:31:42,877
What ship are you on?

554
00:31:43,169 --> 00:31:44,879
I'm on the good...

555
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:47,632
- ship...
- Yes.

556
00:31:48,299 --> 00:31:50,343
Lollipop. I'm in a bathtub.

557
00:31:58,351 --> 00:31:59,352
Mommy!

558
00:31:59,477 --> 00:32:01,812
Mommy, my boat went down the dwain!

559
00:32:02,188 --> 00:32:04,523
My boat went down the dwain, Mommy!

560
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,568
Not that far back.

561
00:32:07,652 --> 00:32:08,653
Far back.

562
00:32:08,778 --> 00:32:13,115
Concentrate on the Kornblatt.
The U.S.S. Kornblatt.

563
00:32:14,909 --> 00:32:15,910
Concentrate.

564
00:32:16,369 --> 00:32:17,495
I'll concentrate.

565
00:32:17,745 --> 00:32:20,164
<i>It's coming back to me now.</i>

566
00:32:20,998 --> 00:32:22,792
<i>Yeah, I can see her.</i>

567
00:32:23,793 --> 00:32:28,005
<i>The Kornblatt gliding
through the blue Pacific.</i>

568
00:32:28,255 --> 00:32:30,883
<i>Trim and beautiful.</i>

569
00:32:31,384 --> 00:32:33,594
<i>Bulging in just the right places.</i>

570
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:37,598
<i>No wonder she was known to us aboard
as the pinup girl of the fleet.</i>

571
00:32:37,848 --> 00:32:40,851
<i>The U.S.S. Marilyn Kornblatt.</i>

572
00:32:41,811 --> 00:32:43,437
<i>It was V.J. Day.</i>

573
00:32:43,938 --> 00:32:45,940
<i>End of the war in the Pacific.</i>

574
00:32:54,907 --> 00:32:57,952
Kornblatt! Orders, orders! Kornblatt!

575
00:32:58,244 --> 00:32:59,203
Who's he?

576
00:32:59,245 --> 00:33:03,040
You remember, sir? Enson Steckler.
Came aboard about a month ago.

577
00:33:03,082 --> 00:33:05,126
You said to put him to
work in the engine room.

578
00:33:05,167 --> 00:33:06,168
Oh, yes.

579
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:08,004
Which he nearly blew up.

580
00:33:08,045 --> 00:33:09,046
Oh, yes!

581
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:12,550
So, now he's helping out in
the communication's shack.

582
00:33:15,636 --> 00:33:18,472
- What do you got there, mister?
- A message from Singpack, sir.

583
00:33:18,556 --> 00:33:20,349
- Well, read it.
- Uh, yes, sir.

584
00:33:20,391 --> 00:33:23,894
Tiddley boo, tiddley bang, clippety
clop chap clang. Poughkeepsie.

585
00:33:24,145 --> 00:33:26,605
Not in code! Let me read that.

586
00:33:29,483 --> 00:33:32,236
Now, hear this men. We're
to proceed to Pearl Harbor

587
00:33:32,278 --> 00:33:34,822
where all officers and men
with enough points will

588
00:33:34,864 --> 00:33:38,117
be flown to the mainland
for immediate discharge.

589
00:33:40,286 --> 00:33:41,287
Very useful.

590
00:33:56,385 --> 00:33:58,387
Now, what did you do that for?

591
00:33:58,596 --> 00:33:59,597
Uh...

592
00:34:33,005 --> 00:34:36,759
<i>We finally put in at Pearl Harbor
and lined up for final inspection.</i>

593
00:34:37,134 --> 00:34:41,013
<i>As we stood there, everyone
had only one thought in mind.</i>

594
00:34:41,347 --> 00:34:43,766
H-O-M-E.

595
00:34:44,141 --> 00:34:45,142
<i>Girls.</i>

596
00:34:48,813 --> 00:34:49,814
Now hear this.

597
00:34:50,564 --> 00:34:53,776
Men, I'm proud to have served
with every one of you.

598
00:34:54,068 --> 00:34:56,028
I'd like to shake every man's hand.

599
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:58,823
But, that would only be
wasting precious time.

600
00:34:58,906 --> 00:35:02,785
All reservists with enough points for
discharge, take off! And that's an order.

601
00:35:08,541 --> 00:35:10,334
Well, I go where my men go.

602
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,878
Congratulations, Bill,
as the new commanding

603
00:35:12,962 --> 00:35:15,881
officer of the U.S.S.
Kornblatt is all yours.

604
00:35:17,299 --> 00:35:19,760
Joe, congratulations on your new job.

605
00:35:20,678 --> 00:35:24,098
Who is going to sail the
Kornblatt to the mainland?

606
00:35:24,348 --> 00:35:27,393
The Commander handed over the
ship to the Lieutenant Commander.

607
00:35:27,601 --> 00:35:30,896
The Lieutenant Commander passed
her along to the Lieutenant.

608
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:34,775
The Lieutenant turned her
over to the Lieutenant J.G..

609
00:35:35,109 --> 00:35:38,529
The Lieutenant J.G. passed
her on to Enson Roberts.

610
00:35:38,863 --> 00:35:41,866
And Roberts gave her to Steckler.

611
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:45,161
And Steckler got stuck...

612
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:50,875
Alright you men!

613
00:35:52,418 --> 00:35:53,419
Now, hear this!

614
00:35:54,712 --> 00:35:56,922
I'm the new skipper of this ship!

615
00:35:57,298 --> 00:35:59,466
Set the special sea and anchor detail!

616
00:35:59,675 --> 00:36:01,468
Stand by and get under way!

617
00:36:03,929 --> 00:36:05,264
Leave your quarters!

618
00:36:26,744 --> 00:36:28,954
Say, say haven't we met someplace before?

619
00:36:29,163 --> 00:36:31,248
Guadalcanal? Iwo Jima?

620
00:36:31,373 --> 00:36:32,583
The Army and Navy game?

621
00:36:32,625 --> 00:36:34,919
Wychinski, sir. Stan Wychinski.
I'm your chief

622
00:36:34,919 --> 00:36:37,296
boat's mate. We just met
in the dock an hour ago.

623
00:36:37,338 --> 00:36:38,339
Oh!

624
00:36:38,714 --> 00:36:39,715
That's right.

625
00:36:40,174 --> 00:36:42,092
Uh, oh yeah, I'm sorry.

626
00:36:42,801 --> 00:36:45,512
I never forget a face. I should've known.

627
00:36:45,888 --> 00:36:47,223
Say, uh Chief, um...

628
00:36:48,182 --> 00:36:49,475
how long you been in the Navy?

629
00:36:49,516 --> 00:36:52,811
Over 20 years, sir. Ten years with the Flat
Tops, five years with the Battle Wagons

630
00:36:53,062 --> 00:36:54,813
the rest of the time on D.E.'s.

631
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,441
Good, cause I'd like to ask you a question.

632
00:36:57,483 --> 00:36:58,651
What's that, sir?

633
00:36:58,776 --> 00:36:59,777
Um.

634
00:37:00,694 --> 00:37:03,322
How do you back this thing out of here?

635
00:37:03,364 --> 00:37:04,865
How do you back this...

636
00:37:06,033 --> 00:37:07,201
It's alright, kid!

637
00:37:08,369 --> 00:37:09,370
I mean, sir.

638
00:37:10,746 --> 00:37:14,416
If you'll excuse me, sir, I have to go aft
to load the popsicles on for the snack bar.

639
00:37:14,792 --> 00:37:15,793
What's this?

640
00:37:15,834 --> 00:37:18,045
Well, you want to calibrate
the Sexton, don't you?

641
00:37:18,379 --> 00:37:19,838
I have a better idea, Chief.

642
00:37:20,005 --> 00:37:23,884
Uh, you calibrate the Sexton
and I'll load the popsicles.

643
00:37:27,554 --> 00:37:30,307
Let's see if we know our
business here, it's a dry run.

644
00:37:30,975 --> 00:37:33,394
All hands stand by to get under way!

645
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:38,232
You men aft forward taking the gangway!

646
00:37:38,649 --> 00:37:41,860
You men aft, lifeboat practice
in the starboard lifeboats!

647
00:37:42,069 --> 00:37:44,822
Wait a minute! Let's change that!
Men aft down in the lifeboats

648
00:37:44,905 --> 00:37:47,950
men forward stand by, men
aft take in the gangway!

649
00:37:49,034 --> 00:37:50,035
Ready to get under way!

650
00:37:50,452 --> 00:37:52,204
That goes for you too
in the engine room.

651
00:37:52,329 --> 00:37:54,415
Sea and anchor detail, stock to it!

652
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:57,126
Forward aft stations, men
aft forward stations!

653
00:37:57,209 --> 00:38:00,796
No, no! Forward, forward aft! I
mean aft, aft, forward, forward!

654
00:38:00,838 --> 00:38:05,134
You're still confused! Look! One of us
has to run this ship. I'm the leader!

655
00:38:05,467 --> 00:38:06,468
I'm the leader?

656
00:38:13,392 --> 00:38:14,393
Now hear this!

657
00:38:15,561 --> 00:38:16,562
Now hear this!

658
00:38:18,731 --> 00:38:20,065
I want a tight ship!

659
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:23,027
I want an efficient ship!

660
00:38:23,944 --> 00:38:25,946
'Cause an efficient ship is a happy ship!

661
00:38:26,488 --> 00:38:28,699
And a happy ship is a tight ship!

662
00:38:28,907 --> 00:38:31,702
And I want everyone to be
efficient, happy, and tight!

663
00:38:32,077 --> 00:38:33,787
There will be no drinking!

664
00:38:34,913 --> 00:38:35,914
That's all!

665
00:38:37,041 --> 00:38:38,375
Next stop San Diego!

666
00:38:40,794 --> 00:38:42,296
All stations report in?

667
00:38:43,672 --> 00:38:45,174
Engines manned and ready?

668
00:38:45,215 --> 00:38:46,759
All stations report in.

669
00:38:47,426 --> 00:38:49,678
All engines manned and ready, sir.

670
00:38:50,387 --> 00:38:51,930
Stand by to answer all bells.

671
00:38:52,056 --> 00:38:53,974
Stand by to answer all bells.

672
00:38:54,892 --> 00:38:56,977
Engines ready to answer all bells, sir.

673
00:38:57,186 --> 00:38:58,687
Right standard rudder.

674
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,190
Port engine add one-third.

675
00:39:02,191 --> 00:39:04,318
Starboard engine back one-third.

676
00:39:04,777 --> 00:39:06,570
Right standard rudder, sir.

677
00:39:07,237 --> 00:39:10,115
Admiral Hawlsey couldn't
have done it any better.

678
00:39:10,866 --> 00:39:13,035
All the stern one-third!

679
00:39:34,848 --> 00:39:38,060
<i>Oh, I missed the part about
taking in the lines.</i>

680
00:39:38,268 --> 00:39:40,062
<i>We were finally on our way.</i>

681
00:39:40,229 --> 00:39:45,818
<i>Ten feet out from Pearl Harbor and
only 2,327 miles to the mainland.</i>

682
00:39:46,318 --> 00:39:48,195
<i>My worries were almost over.</i>

683
00:40:07,548 --> 00:40:10,050
<i>So, there I was in command
of the Kornblatt.</i>

684
00:40:10,134 --> 00:40:12,469
<i>I was doing everything by the book.</i>

685
00:40:12,636 --> 00:40:14,513
<i>And the book was doing fine.</i>

686
00:40:14,721 --> 00:40:19,143
<i>Then, on the third day out, I had to
take a sight to check our course.</i>

687
00:40:19,184 --> 00:40:21,437
<i>Wychinski was waiting in the wheel house.</i>

688
00:40:21,645 --> 00:40:22,646
Now hear this!

689
00:40:23,439 --> 00:40:24,440
Now hear this!

690
00:40:25,691 --> 00:40:28,068
Stand by to change course!

691
00:40:28,193 --> 00:40:31,989
35 degrees left rudder!

692
00:40:47,796 --> 00:40:49,673
Waiting further orders, sir.

693
00:40:50,382 --> 00:40:52,843
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Coming up!

694
00:41:01,185 --> 00:41:02,311
Aw, there we are!

695
00:41:03,228 --> 00:41:04,229
Yeah!

696
00:41:04,313 --> 00:41:06,773
44 and a half degrees left rudder!

697
00:41:07,983 --> 00:41:09,943
No, make that 44 and a third!

698
00:41:11,153 --> 00:41:13,822
62 and two-fifths right rudder!

699
00:41:13,864 --> 00:41:15,657
Are you sure of your readings, sir?

700
00:41:16,074 --> 00:41:20,787
Diagonal obtuse of single
axle forward mark!

701
00:41:20,913 --> 00:41:22,956
That doesn't sound right to me.

702
00:41:23,373 --> 00:41:25,167
Maybe he knows a short cut.

703
00:41:36,845 --> 00:41:40,265
<i>We were sailing a straight and
true course for San Diego.</i>

704
00:41:40,432 --> 00:41:44,978
<i>Well, almost a straight course. I
will admit we skidded a few times.</i>

705
00:42:13,131 --> 00:42:15,676
<i>Well, things were pretty
mixed up for a while.</i>

706
00:42:15,759 --> 00:42:17,553
<i>Lucky there wasn't much traffic.</i>

707
00:42:17,803 --> 00:42:20,222
<i>Five days out we spotted land ahead.</i>

708
00:42:20,222 --> 00:42:22,432
<i>An island uncharted on any map.</i>

709
00:42:22,849 --> 00:42:24,768
<i>We had just made an important discovery.</i>

710
00:42:25,102 --> 00:42:26,103
<i>We were lost.</i>

711
00:42:26,103 --> 00:42:31,275
<i>I realized I had made a boo boo so I
named our discovery "Boo Boo Island"!</i>

712
00:42:31,275 --> 00:42:33,527
All engines ahead one-third.

713
00:42:41,118 --> 00:42:44,454
What happened? I didn't say stop! I
said all engines ahead one-third!

714
00:42:44,496 --> 00:42:47,708
That might be a little tough, sir.
You see we're on a reef.

715
00:42:47,833 --> 00:42:48,834
On a reef?

716
00:42:50,961 --> 00:42:52,921
Maybe we ought to radio for help, sir.

717
00:42:53,213 --> 00:42:54,172
Radio for help?

718
00:42:54,298 --> 00:42:57,134
And have a blot on our record?
No sir! Not on your life!

719
00:42:57,134 --> 00:42:59,845
We'll sit right here and wait
for that tide to come back in!

720
00:43:00,095 --> 00:43:02,055
That's it! Wait for the tide.

721
00:43:02,556 --> 00:43:05,851
Could it have gone very far?
The tide? Do you think?

722
00:43:05,934 --> 00:43:07,853
- Life jacket, sir.
- Life jacket?

723
00:43:07,853 --> 00:43:09,855
<i>But the tide didn't come back.</i>

724
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:12,107
<i>So I decided to investigate the island.</i>

725
00:43:12,441 --> 00:43:16,903
<i>Maybe there were people on it and
they could tell us where we were.</i>

726
00:44:21,843 --> 00:44:23,637
It's awfully quiet here, ain't it?

727
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,806
Don't be scared, Skipper, the war's over.

728
00:44:26,431 --> 00:44:29,518
C'mon, Brown you take the right
flank, I'll take the left flank.

729
00:44:29,851 --> 00:44:32,396
I'll wait in the boat for you, fellas.

730
00:44:33,313 --> 00:44:34,314
Okay?

731
00:44:36,316 --> 00:44:37,317
Fellas?

732
00:44:39,736 --> 00:44:40,737
Fellas?

733
00:44:42,989 --> 00:44:43,990
Fellas?

734
00:44:54,835 --> 00:44:55,836
Shhh!

735
00:45:03,468 --> 00:45:06,221
Make some noise, birdies, it's too quiet.

736
00:45:07,764 --> 00:45:09,975
After all, what have we got to...

737
00:45:12,978 --> 00:45:13,979
Help! Help!

738
00:45:16,189 --> 00:45:17,190
Wychinski!

739
00:45:18,525 --> 00:45:19,526
Help! Help!

740
00:45:22,195 --> 00:45:23,780
Help! Help!

741
00:45:24,489 --> 00:45:26,074
Wychinski!

742
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:27,951
Help!

743
00:45:28,118 --> 00:45:29,119
Help! Help!

744
00:45:29,494 --> 00:45:30,829
Help! Help!

745
00:45:31,788 --> 00:45:34,624
What are you yelling about? I'm
the one that's in trouble!

746
00:45:38,837 --> 00:45:40,881
Help! Help! Wychinski!

747
00:45:40,922 --> 00:45:43,925
- That way, Chief.
- Well, go ahead, go ahead.

748
00:45:44,259 --> 00:45:45,343
Help!

749
00:45:47,512 --> 00:45:48,513
Help!

750
00:45:51,057 --> 00:45:52,058
Thanks, fellas!

751
00:45:52,768 --> 00:45:54,853
I never thought you'd get here.

752
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,861
Oh, thanks, Wychinski. Thanks, Brown.

753
00:46:05,363 --> 00:46:06,364
Wychinski?

754
00:46:08,033 --> 00:46:09,034
Brown?

755
00:46:11,161 --> 00:46:12,579
Alright. Okay.

756
00:46:12,704 --> 00:46:14,581
Here, here you are. Here it is.

757
00:46:15,123 --> 00:46:16,541
No, you're making a mistake.

758
00:46:16,625 --> 00:46:18,043
You don't understand!

759
00:46:19,252 --> 00:46:20,837
Wait a minute! Will you wait and let...

760
00:46:21,129 --> 00:46:23,632
Well, let me explain! You don't understand!

761
00:46:23,715 --> 00:46:25,133
The war is over!

762
00:46:25,425 --> 00:46:27,344
Here! Nobody's mad at nobody.

763
00:46:28,178 --> 00:46:31,056
We're friends. You friend, me friend. How.

764
00:46:33,892 --> 00:46:36,353
Wait a minute. What are you charging?

765
00:46:41,525 --> 00:46:42,609
What does that mean?

766
00:46:42,734 --> 00:46:44,110
Colonel wish to speak to you.

767
00:46:44,152 --> 00:46:47,322
Well, what' he want to speak to me. They
don't understand that the war is over.

768
00:46:48,406 --> 00:46:50,283
American sailor boy.

769
00:46:50,659 --> 00:46:53,495
Welcome to Island of Yonukshma.

770
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:54,788
Well, thank you. It's a very...

771
00:46:54,871 --> 00:46:57,666
You are prisoner of Colonel Ginzo Tagashi.

772
00:46:58,333 --> 00:47:01,253
Well, thank you Colonel, but I
don't like to sound contradictory

773
00:47:01,294 --> 00:47:06,758
but if anybody's prisoner of anybody, you're
my prisoner. You see the war is over.

774
00:47:07,259 --> 00:47:08,802
Who win?

775
00:47:09,261 --> 00:47:11,930
Who win? Well, I hope
you don't get mad, but

776
00:47:12,347 --> 00:47:13,348
we win.

777
00:47:13,515 --> 00:47:15,767
Who win, American sailor boy?

778
00:47:16,518 --> 00:47:17,477
You win.

779
00:47:18,061 --> 00:47:19,437
But, haven't you heard?

780
00:47:19,521 --> 00:47:21,398
- The war is over.
- Silence!

781
00:47:21,398 --> 00:47:23,275
When war is over we hear about it.

782
00:47:23,316 --> 00:47:26,361
- Yeah, but I swear.
- You lie, American sailor boy.

783
00:47:26,403 --> 00:47:28,738
Because you lie, you die!

784
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:29,781
Oh, ow! Wait!

785
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:30,991
I die?

786
00:47:32,409 --> 00:47:33,577
You're making a mistake!

787
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:37,289
A mistake! The war is over!

788
00:47:37,539 --> 00:47:40,000
You shouldn't kill a person when it's over!

789
00:47:40,125 --> 00:47:41,668
I could swear it came from here.

790
00:47:41,877 --> 00:47:44,421
Wait a minute. Here's some footprints.

791
00:47:48,967 --> 00:47:49,968
Oh no.

792
00:47:49,968 --> 00:47:50,969
Poor Steckler.

793
00:47:51,845 --> 00:47:54,764
He was only and Enson, but underneath
it he was a really good Joe.

794
00:47:54,931 --> 00:47:56,308
I don't see his body.

795
00:47:59,394 --> 00:48:00,604
Washed out to sea.

796
00:48:02,397 --> 00:48:03,940
He would've liked that.

797
00:48:05,775 --> 00:48:07,652
Let's go back to the Kornblatt.

798
00:48:13,533 --> 00:48:16,328
You didn't lie, told them the war
is over, but you gotta stay awake.

799
00:48:17,370 --> 00:48:18,663
Oh, I'll stay awake.

800
00:48:20,206 --> 00:48:22,709
I'm just have, let me
sleep just half asleep.

801
00:48:23,126 --> 00:48:25,128
One. No, all the way. Alright.

802
00:48:25,754 --> 00:48:26,755
I got

803
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:27,881
will power.

804
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:31,343
You gotta have will power.
Strong, be strong. You don't...

805
00:48:32,761 --> 00:48:35,555
Oh, that wasn't very good will power.

806
00:48:37,390 --> 00:48:38,850
Oh, tired. No I don't.

807
00:48:41,811 --> 00:48:43,605
Noise will keep you from...

808
00:48:44,439 --> 00:48:45,440
falling asleep.

809
00:48:46,983 --> 00:48:47,984
Get some.

810
00:48:50,153 --> 00:48:51,154
That'll keep.

811
00:49:08,713 --> 00:49:09,714
Wake up.

812
00:49:10,173 --> 00:49:11,174
Wake up!

813
00:49:11,716 --> 00:49:12,717
Wake up!

814
00:49:17,222 --> 00:49:18,223
Good morning.

815
00:49:18,390 --> 00:49:20,266
Sunrise. Time you die.

816
00:49:21,184 --> 00:49:22,310
Before breakfast?

817
00:49:22,769 --> 00:49:23,895
Alright, alright.

818
00:49:31,319 --> 00:49:32,362
Let me just get.

819
00:49:55,176 --> 00:49:59,347
So, American sailor boy, you show
contempt for Japanese fighting squad.

820
00:49:59,514 --> 00:50:00,974
Oh, no, I don't.

821
00:50:01,850 --> 00:50:03,226
It's just I'm very...

822
00:50:05,478 --> 00:50:06,521
What's-what's that?

823
00:50:06,521 --> 00:50:08,231
Prepare the prisoner for execution!

824
00:50:08,273 --> 00:50:10,942
Wait, the war is... you don't understand.

825
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:14,320
Hey, just a minute!
You're making a mistake!

826
00:50:39,304 --> 00:50:41,264
I cannot kill a man in his sleep!

827
00:50:41,347 --> 00:50:42,682
Wake up! Wake up!

828
00:51:05,705 --> 00:51:06,956
War is over?

829
00:51:08,541 --> 00:51:13,296
American sailor boy, you are right.
War is over. You are right.

830
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:15,256
Wake up. Wake up!

831
00:51:23,723 --> 00:51:25,225
You right. War is over!

832
00:51:26,226 --> 00:51:28,019
- You didn't shoot me?
- No.

833
00:51:28,436 --> 00:51:29,813
- Are you gonna?
- No!

834
00:51:29,938 --> 00:51:32,982
We lose, we surrender. We are prisoners.

835
00:51:32,982 --> 00:51:36,236
Oh, well I don't want any prisoners.
Thank you very much.

836
00:51:36,778 --> 00:51:37,779
The Kornblatt.

837
00:51:38,488 --> 00:51:40,865
Give my regards to all your friends.

838
00:51:41,157 --> 00:51:42,158
Wych...

839
00:51:42,408 --> 00:51:43,409
inski!

840
00:51:52,877 --> 00:51:53,878
My ship!

841
00:51:54,087 --> 00:51:55,171
Where's my ship?

842
00:51:56,047 --> 00:51:57,465
Colonel Tagahashi!

843
00:51:57,882 --> 00:52:00,593
We are prisoners of American sailor boy.

844
00:52:00,677 --> 00:52:02,887
Colonel Tagahashi, where's my ship?

845
00:52:03,096 --> 00:52:05,431
Surrender arms to American sailor boy!

846
00:52:05,473 --> 00:52:07,892
No, wait, oh, whoa, whoa I
don't want any guns.

847
00:52:07,934 --> 00:52:10,311
Wait, oh whoa, I don't want any arms!

848
00:52:10,353 --> 00:52:12,814
Wait, I don't want, I
don't want any prisoners.

849
00:52:12,856 --> 00:52:14,816
I just want... I want my ship.

850
00:52:14,941 --> 00:52:17,610
Oh, it's gotta be around here someplace.

851
00:52:17,902 --> 00:52:18,903
Lieutenant.

852
00:52:18,945 --> 00:52:20,113
Colonel Tagahashi.

853
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:22,699
You're not Colonel Tagahashi.

854
00:52:23,324 --> 00:52:26,119
You're too pretty to be Colonel Tagahashi.

855
00:52:26,536 --> 00:52:27,537
You're...

856
00:52:28,204 --> 00:52:29,205
Enson Benson.

857
00:52:30,957 --> 00:52:33,835
Was that the last you saw of the Kornblatt?

858
00:52:34,085 --> 00:52:36,004
I'm telling the truth, Enson.

859
00:52:36,129 --> 00:52:38,548
I never saw the Kornblatt again.

860
00:52:38,548 --> 00:52:42,177
Then, why did you sign out for her
one month later in San Diego?

861
00:52:42,302 --> 00:52:46,764
For the simple reason that when I showed
up, I was signing papers for three days.

862
00:52:46,890 --> 00:52:49,934
Everything and anything they put
in front of me, I was signing.

863
00:52:50,185 --> 00:52:54,189
As a matter of fact, I'm still making
payments on a Quonset hut in the Aleutians.

864
00:52:54,898 --> 00:52:58,109
You signed out for a ship without
even knowing she existed?

865
00:52:58,234 --> 00:53:01,404
Who cared? The war was over. The
Kornblatt was decommissioned.

866
00:53:01,487 --> 00:53:03,865
Don't you understand?
Anyhow, I should've gotten a

867
00:53:03,907 --> 00:53:07,410
medal for capturing an entire
island all by myself. Single handed.

868
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:11,623
Then, when I went back to Pearl Harbor, I
heard Wychinski checked her in in San Diego.

869
00:53:11,873 --> 00:53:14,000
- There's no record of that.
- There's no record of it?

870
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,377
It's 7 o'clock, could I go?
My wife is waiting.

871
00:53:17,128 --> 00:53:18,880
Run along. We'll get
together in the morning.

872
00:53:19,047 --> 00:53:21,341
Wh-what do you think? Do we have a chance?

873
00:53:21,799 --> 00:53:24,052
Before we find the Kornblatt,
it seems to me we'll have

874
00:53:24,052 --> 00:53:26,054
to come up with a bosun's
mate named Wychinski.

875
00:53:26,137 --> 00:53:28,056
Yeah, we'll have to find him.

876
00:53:29,098 --> 00:53:30,600
- Oh, Lieutenant?
- Yes.

877
00:53:30,975 --> 00:53:34,479
If you get a chance tonight give
this matter some thought, will you?

878
00:53:36,606 --> 00:53:38,858
If I'm lucky I won't get a chance.

879
00:53:44,530 --> 00:53:46,741
Well, here we are.

880
00:53:47,116 --> 00:53:48,409
And here we go.

881
00:53:48,493 --> 00:53:52,830
I promised I would carry you across
the threshold and I keep my...

882
00:53:53,164 --> 00:53:54,082
promise.

883
00:53:54,123 --> 00:53:55,500
Oh, poochie.

884
00:53:56,501 --> 00:53:57,502
Okay.

885
00:53:59,045 --> 00:54:01,214
In my pock... no dear
it wouldn't be there.

886
00:54:01,297 --> 00:54:02,048
No?

887
00:54:02,090 --> 00:54:03,841
- No, try...
- No, not here, either.

888
00:54:03,883 --> 00:54:06,302
Take those, dear. Try down
below, in that pocket.

889
00:54:06,302 --> 00:54:08,972
- No, not here, either.
- Well, the other side.

890
00:54:09,013 --> 00:54:11,224
- Do you feel anything there?
- No, no it's not here.

891
00:54:11,224 --> 00:54:14,394
Well, just give me your arm, dear.
Try the back pocket.

892
00:54:14,602 --> 00:54:15,603
That's it.

893
00:54:16,396 --> 00:54:17,730
The-the back pocket.

894
00:54:18,106 --> 00:54:19,524
- Do you have it?
- No, it's not here either.

895
00:54:19,565 --> 00:54:20,858
Try the other side.

896
00:54:21,234 --> 00:54:22,568
Oh, here it is! Here it is!

897
00:54:22,652 --> 00:54:23,861
Oh, wait a minute.

898
00:54:24,696 --> 00:54:25,738
Here it is! Yes!

899
00:54:25,738 --> 00:54:26,864
Where is it dear?

900
00:54:26,906 --> 00:54:28,533
- Here.
- Well, let me have it.

901
00:54:28,658 --> 00:54:30,451
Honey, that's fine.

902
00:54:30,743 --> 00:54:34,163
Just try and relax, dear,
because you're a little heavy.

903
00:54:34,205 --> 00:54:37,083
- Alright.
- Here we go, dear. I got it now.

904
00:54:42,171 --> 00:54:43,172
Well, darling.

905
00:54:43,548 --> 00:54:44,549
Alone at last.

906
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:48,261
Alone?

907
00:54:49,971 --> 00:54:51,889
- Mother!
- What are you doing here?

908
00:54:52,181 --> 00:54:55,184
Well, Prudence called and said you
were staying at some navy place.

909
00:54:55,351 --> 00:54:58,271
I thought you'd be delighted to
have someone keep you company.

910
00:54:58,479 --> 00:54:59,480
I am.

911
00:54:59,522 --> 00:55:00,523
Him.

912
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:01,941
Well.

913
00:55:02,150 --> 00:55:03,985
Now that you're here, mom...

914
00:55:04,277 --> 00:55:06,779
- and now that we're here.
- Yes?

915
00:55:08,406 --> 00:55:09,490
Here we all are!

916
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,452
Anyone for aspirin?

917
00:55:12,702 --> 00:55:15,246
John, you don't look at all well.

918
00:55:15,621 --> 00:55:18,541
I can't say married life
is agreeing with you.

919
00:55:18,541 --> 00:55:21,127
I can't say it myself. I wouldn't know.

920
00:55:21,252 --> 00:55:25,089
Well! I certainly didn't mean
to barge in on your honeymoon.

921
00:55:25,131 --> 00:55:28,051
I'll just get the hotel to move me
to another room for the night.

922
00:55:28,051 --> 00:55:31,804
Oh, no! I'll do it Mother! I'll run right
down and I'll talk to the room clerk.

923
00:55:31,804 --> 00:55:33,306
You can phone him.

924
00:55:34,223 --> 00:55:37,018
Oh, no, but I don't mind. The
exercise will do me good.

925
00:55:37,143 --> 00:55:39,312
I'll talk to the room clerk
myself and I'll sign the names

926
00:55:39,312 --> 00:55:41,856
so that we're sure that you have your room.
My head is just a little stuck.

927
00:55:41,856 --> 00:55:44,692
I'll get it. The arm. Help me with the arm.
There we go.

928
00:55:45,193 --> 00:55:46,861
- Lieutenant.
- Thank you.

929
00:55:47,195 --> 00:55:50,573
- Across the hall from Ma's?
- I'm sorry, sir. It's all we have.

930
00:55:52,075 --> 00:55:55,995
Well, it's better than having
her in the apartment with us.

931
00:56:00,458 --> 00:56:01,459
There he is.

932
00:56:01,584 --> 00:56:02,543
Let's tell him.

933
00:56:02,585 --> 00:56:04,587
I hope he don't go into shock.

934
00:56:06,214 --> 00:56:07,215
Thank you.

935
00:56:08,591 --> 00:56:09,592
Oh, hi fellas.

936
00:56:09,717 --> 00:56:12,512
You're a little early. I'm not
due at B.O.Q. til midnight.

937
00:56:12,637 --> 00:56:16,307
Sorry, Lieutenant. That's been changed.
It's beddie-bye at nine.

938
00:56:16,432 --> 00:56:17,892
Admiral's orders, sir.

939
00:56:17,934 --> 00:56:20,645
But you don't understand. My
wife is upstairs waiting for me.

940
00:56:20,812 --> 00:56:23,272
Yeah, I guess you oughta
say goodnight to her.

941
00:56:23,981 --> 00:56:25,233
Mrs. Steckler, please.

942
00:56:25,274 --> 00:56:27,485
But, why can't I go up and say...

943
00:56:28,653 --> 00:56:29,654
Hello?

944
00:56:30,196 --> 00:56:31,197
Prudence?

945
00:56:32,365 --> 00:56:33,366
Guess what?

946
00:56:33,533 --> 00:56:35,159
Oh no!

947
00:56:35,701 --> 00:56:36,911
But, duckie poo.

948
00:56:37,453 --> 00:56:38,913
- This is our...
- Ru!

949
00:56:39,455 --> 00:56:40,456
Your navy.

950
00:56:40,957 --> 00:56:41,958
Yes.

951
00:56:42,208 --> 00:56:43,543
I'm a navy wife.

952
00:56:44,001 --> 00:56:45,628
I understand.

953
00:56:46,129 --> 00:56:47,380
Goodnight, darling.

954
00:56:49,799 --> 00:56:51,968
They're taking him away again.

955
00:56:53,594 --> 00:56:56,222
What are you crying about, child? I'm here.

956
00:56:56,222 --> 00:56:57,223
Oh!

957
00:56:58,349 --> 00:57:02,603
There, there. Mother will
take care of everything.

958
00:57:03,229 --> 00:57:04,564
Oh!

959
00:57:08,943 --> 00:57:13,406
I can tell you this, Congressman. We're
making remarkable progress. Remarkable.

960
00:57:14,282 --> 00:57:17,535
As soon as we process certain
incontrovertable facts

961
00:57:17,618 --> 00:57:21,205
and eliminate all dubious
inconsistencies, we'll be able to arrive

962
00:57:21,205 --> 00:57:23,124
at an inescapable conclusion.

963
00:57:23,499 --> 00:57:27,253
In other words you're right
back where you started from?

964
00:57:27,712 --> 00:57:30,006
Well, you might put it that way.

965
00:57:30,548 --> 00:57:32,425
I'll see you at the hearing.

966
00:57:35,595 --> 00:57:36,804
Enson Benson, sir.

967
00:57:38,848 --> 00:57:39,849
Hello?

968
00:57:40,558 --> 00:57:42,310
- Hello! Hello!
- She's here, sir.

969
00:57:42,518 --> 00:57:43,519
Oh?

970
00:57:43,978 --> 00:57:44,979
Oh!

971
00:57:45,688 --> 00:57:47,565
Why aren't you out finding the Kornblatt?

972
00:57:47,773 --> 00:57:51,819
Well, uh, as a matter of fact, sir,
we're making remarkable progress.

973
00:57:51,903 --> 00:57:54,113
And we're now in possession
of certain incontrovertable

974
00:57:54,155 --> 00:57:55,990
facts that eliminate all
dubious possibilities.

975
00:57:56,032 --> 00:57:58,409
Oh, please! I've already
been through all that.

976
00:57:58,826 --> 00:58:00,328
So, you don't know where it is, huh?

977
00:58:00,536 --> 00:58:01,787
Well, no.

978
00:58:01,996 --> 00:58:03,789
But we know where it isn't.

979
00:58:03,873 --> 00:58:04,874
Oh, great.

980
00:58:06,417 --> 00:58:10,254
This man is the shrewdest, cleverest
undercover agent we've ever been up against!

981
00:58:10,296 --> 00:58:13,966
But, sir, I think he's too dumb to be
that smart to play it that stupid.

982
00:58:16,469 --> 00:58:17,470
Say that again.

983
00:58:18,012 --> 00:58:21,474
What I mean is his story is just
too fantastic not to be true.

984
00:58:21,682 --> 00:58:22,683
I believe him.

985
00:58:23,059 --> 00:58:24,060
Enson Benson.

986
00:58:24,769 --> 00:58:26,854
I don't have to remind you
what's at stake here.

987
00:58:27,063 --> 00:58:28,606
Navy pride, Navy honor.

988
00:58:28,856 --> 00:58:32,777
Navy appropriations. Four billion
dollars, man, that's real Navy.

989
00:58:33,986 --> 00:58:35,571
- For you, sir.
- For me?

990
00:58:35,613 --> 00:58:38,491
- Excuse me, sir, something just came in.
- You found the Kornblatt?

991
00:58:38,616 --> 00:58:40,243
No, but we found Wychinski.

992
00:58:40,326 --> 00:58:41,953
Oh, great. Who's he?

993
00:58:42,245 --> 00:58:45,331
Well, according to Steckler he's the man
who brought the Kornblatt into port.

994
00:58:45,373 --> 00:58:48,334
We've located him in Miami, Florida
care of the Starlight Grove.

995
00:58:48,501 --> 00:58:50,962
You and Steckler take my plane.
Contact him at once.

996
00:58:51,337 --> 00:58:53,172
- Well, get moving!
- Aye, aye, sir.

997
00:58:53,339 --> 00:58:56,592
I'll have the shore patrol
pick up Steckler, sir.

998
00:59:07,436 --> 00:59:09,522
Sorry. Excuse me. I beg your pardon.

999
00:59:09,647 --> 00:59:14,986
Excuse me, please. My key. I can't
remember the room. What room is my key in?

1000
00:59:15,194 --> 00:59:16,696
- 1105, Lieutenant.
- Yes.

1001
00:59:16,737 --> 00:59:19,407
But you don't need a key. I believe Mrs.
Steckler is waiting for you.

1002
00:59:19,407 --> 00:59:22,535
Oh, she is. Oh, thank you.
Thank you very much.

1003
00:59:46,892 --> 00:59:49,437
- Yes?
- I brought you the wrinkly cream, Mother.

1004
00:59:49,770 --> 00:59:50,771
Come on in.

1005
00:59:55,151 --> 00:59:58,279
Hey, what's wrong with you?
What are you doing?

1006
01:00:29,101 --> 01:00:30,102
Prudence.

1007
01:00:30,936 --> 01:00:31,937
John.

1008
01:00:34,899 --> 01:00:35,900
Sweetheart.

1009
01:00:36,108 --> 01:00:37,109
Darling.

1010
01:00:38,402 --> 01:00:39,403
Baby face.

1011
01:00:39,695 --> 01:00:40,696
Angel.

1012
01:00:42,114 --> 01:00:43,115
Lovey doll.

1013
01:00:43,324 --> 01:00:44,909
Oh, honey.

1014
01:00:46,243 --> 01:00:47,244
Poochie.

1015
01:00:47,328 --> 01:00:48,329
Pie!

1016
01:00:49,872 --> 01:00:50,873
Not again!

1017
01:00:50,956 --> 01:00:52,917
Sorry, sir. Admiral's orders.

1018
01:00:52,958 --> 01:00:55,753
Yeah? Well, I'm coming through!

1019
01:00:56,003 --> 01:00:57,338
No, I'm not going!

1020
01:00:57,505 --> 01:00:58,798
I'm not going!

1021
01:00:58,881 --> 01:01:00,174
I'm not going!

1022
01:01:00,257 --> 01:01:01,592
Gone!

1023
01:01:16,357 --> 01:01:17,358
That's him!

1024
01:01:17,525 --> 01:01:18,651
That's Wychinski!

1025
01:01:18,818 --> 01:01:19,819
C'mon.

1026
01:01:27,118 --> 01:01:28,369
Hey, Wychinski!

1027
01:01:32,665 --> 01:01:34,208
You! It's you!

1028
01:01:34,458 --> 01:01:36,460
You remember me? John Paul Steckler.

1029
01:01:36,669 --> 01:01:38,754
The seventh! I thought you were dead!

1030
01:01:38,921 --> 01:01:41,507
I wish I was. We'd like to talk to you.

1031
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:45,302
Yeah, any time, Lieutenant. Excuse me.

1032
01:01:54,145 --> 01:01:55,146
Stan.

1033
01:01:55,438 --> 01:01:56,439
Now.

1034
01:01:56,939 --> 01:01:57,982
What's on your mind, pal?

1035
01:01:58,065 --> 01:02:00,651
Well, Stan there are some questions
that only you can answer.

1036
01:02:00,651 --> 01:02:03,487
- You see, now first of all...
- Excuse me.

1037
01:02:05,698 --> 01:02:08,075
- Let me have the rope, will you, pal?
- Oh, yeah. Here you go.

1038
01:02:08,617 --> 01:02:09,618
Thanks a lot.

1039
01:02:11,328 --> 01:02:12,955
You sure you ain't dead?

1040
01:02:13,038 --> 01:02:14,540
I mean what can I do for you?

1041
01:02:14,582 --> 01:02:19,503
Mr. Wychinski we're trying to find a
destroyer escort. The U.S.S. Kornblatt.

1042
01:02:19,503 --> 01:02:21,380
Yeah. Do you remember, Stan?

1043
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:23,215
Stan! Wychinski!

1044
01:02:23,257 --> 01:02:26,135
We just want to find if you remember. Stan?

1045
01:02:26,343 --> 01:02:27,344
Stan?

1046
01:02:28,137 --> 01:02:30,264
We want to know if you remember?

1047
01:02:32,266 --> 01:02:34,810
Hey, Stan, you remember
the Kornblatt, don't you?

1048
01:02:34,852 --> 01:02:36,979
Remember? How could I forget it.

1049
01:02:37,521 --> 01:02:39,857
Watch it will you? I'm
talking to my friends.

1050
01:02:39,940 --> 01:02:40,941
Excuse me.

1051
01:02:41,567 --> 01:02:42,610
Excuse me.

1052
01:02:42,651 --> 01:02:44,111
Wait, wait! Wychinski!

1053
01:02:44,612 --> 01:02:45,654
Wait. Wychinski.

1054
01:02:46,071 --> 01:02:48,449
Wychinski. Listen, Wychinski.

1055
01:02:49,283 --> 01:02:51,827
Do you remember signing all
of the decommissioning papers?

1056
01:02:53,370 --> 01:02:54,371
I think so.

1057
01:02:54,413 --> 01:02:59,210
Well, Wychinski, the big question is who
did you sign the Kornblatt over to?

1058
01:02:59,251 --> 01:03:00,252
Who did you...

1059
01:03:02,838 --> 01:03:06,217
Now I remember. We turned the
ship over to a Lieutenant J.G..

1060
01:03:06,258 --> 01:03:08,135
- Yeah, what was his name?
- Help us, Wychinski!

1061
01:03:08,135 --> 01:03:09,136
I forgot.

1062
01:03:09,845 --> 01:03:10,846
Hit him again.

1063
01:03:14,934 --> 01:03:15,935
Watch it!

1064
01:03:16,268 --> 01:03:17,269
That hurt!

1065
01:03:18,979 --> 01:03:21,023
Whose side are you on anyhow?

1066
01:03:21,106 --> 01:03:22,983
I'm on your side, Stan.
I was just telling...

1067
01:03:23,025 --> 01:03:24,151
Wait a minute!

1068
01:03:24,819 --> 01:03:27,154
- I just remembered!
- He remembers!

1069
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:29,240
Wait! He's remembered!

1070
01:03:30,449 --> 01:03:32,993
- Who? You said you remembered.
- Now I forgot again.

1071
01:03:33,118 --> 01:03:37,122
He had it, he had it and
you made him forget.

1072
01:04:31,302 --> 01:04:32,761
Well, looks like a bad one.

1073
01:04:32,761 --> 01:04:34,722
The weather boys say
it's going to get worse.

1074
01:04:34,805 --> 01:04:36,015
Not a chance, huh?

1075
01:04:36,098 --> 01:04:37,892
No, I'm afraid you're grounded, Lieutenant.

1076
01:04:38,058 --> 01:04:39,310
Grounded? What for?

1077
01:04:40,477 --> 01:04:43,522
It's a beautiful night out.
There isn't a cloud in the sky.

1078
01:04:43,772 --> 01:04:45,608
Uh, there's a little breeze.

1079
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:48,611
It's wet and damp a little
but I just got to get

1080
01:04:48,652 --> 01:04:50,362
to Washington tonight.
Isn't there any way...

1081
01:04:50,362 --> 01:04:51,447
No, not in the air.

1082
01:04:51,614 --> 01:04:52,573
Not in the air.

1083
01:04:52,698 --> 01:04:56,660
Well, there is a train leaving from
downtown in about, oh, 40 minutes.

1084
01:04:56,744 --> 01:04:58,203
It's generally pretty jammed, though.

1085
01:04:58,203 --> 01:04:59,371
Can you try to get us on it?

1086
01:04:59,413 --> 01:05:03,208
Well, sure thing. Uh, Peggy, see what you
can do about getting them on the train.

1087
01:05:03,250 --> 01:05:04,251
Yes, sir.

1088
01:05:05,502 --> 01:05:07,296
Uh, I'd like to call my wife.
May I use your phone?

1089
01:05:07,296 --> 01:05:09,256
- Sure, go ahead.
- Thank you.

1090
01:05:11,842 --> 01:05:12,885
Hello, operator.

1091
01:05:13,385 --> 01:05:16,138
I'd like to call Washington D.C., please.

1092
01:05:19,642 --> 01:05:20,476
<i>Mrs. Steckler?</i>

1093
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:22,353
Yes, this is Mrs. Steckler.

1094
01:05:22,686 --> 01:05:23,896
<i>Mr. Steckler calling.</i>

1095
01:05:24,021 --> 01:05:25,022
Oh, put him on.

1096
01:05:26,982 --> 01:05:28,067
John.

1097
01:05:28,359 --> 01:05:31,153
I just knew you'd get away
from bachelor quarters.

1098
01:05:31,362 --> 01:05:33,948
I never got to bachelor quarters, dear.

1099
01:05:34,073 --> 01:05:35,074
Where are you?

1100
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:36,283
<i>Florida.</i>

1101
01:05:36,367 --> 01:05:37,368
Florida?

1102
01:05:38,035 --> 01:05:40,704
And I had Mother move into another room.

1103
01:05:41,372 --> 01:05:42,498
Honey, I can't...

1104
01:05:43,666 --> 01:05:45,834
There's a slight hurricane here.

1105
01:05:46,543 --> 01:05:47,544
A hurricane.

1106
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:50,673
They're trying to get Benson and
me out on the train tonight.

1107
01:05:50,839 --> 01:05:52,049
You're all set, Lieutenant.

1108
01:05:52,174 --> 01:05:54,426
Oh, did you hear that, dear? I'm all set.

1109
01:05:54,593 --> 01:05:57,429
- You got the last available accommodation.
- Oh, that's swell. Thank you.

1110
01:05:57,930 --> 01:05:59,682
You and the Enson will
be sharing a bedroom.

1111
01:05:59,682 --> 01:06:00,557
Fine.

1112
01:06:00,599 --> 01:06:02,935
Honey, Benson and I will be sharing...

1113
01:06:03,227 --> 01:06:04,228
What?

1114
01:06:04,395 --> 01:06:05,396
Benson and I?

1115
01:06:05,604 --> 01:06:06,814
But, Benson's a...

1116
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:08,232
Hello?

1117
01:06:08,357 --> 01:06:11,902
Hello, Prudence? Prudence, you still
there, dear? Honey, can you hear me?

1118
01:06:12,027 --> 01:06:14,863
Why can't you share a bedroom with Benson?

1119
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:18,575
Hello? Hello, operator?

1120
01:06:19,159 --> 01:06:21,453
<i>I'm sorry, madam, your
party's been disconnected.</i>

1121
01:06:21,787 --> 01:06:24,039
My party never got started.

1122
01:06:26,917 --> 01:06:28,669
Hello, operator? Operator?

1123
01:06:28,877 --> 01:06:29,878
Prudence?

1124
01:06:30,045 --> 01:06:31,213
She hung up on me.

1125
01:06:32,381 --> 01:06:34,758
No she didn't. Look, all
the wires are down.

1126
01:06:34,925 --> 01:06:38,178
You can explain it all to her tomorrow.
Right now we've got a train to catch.

1127
01:06:38,470 --> 01:06:40,055
Here, Lieutenant, take these.

1128
01:06:40,222 --> 01:06:42,182
- You'll need them.
- Thank you. Thank you.

1129
01:06:42,182 --> 01:06:44,852
We'll send them back to you all pressed
when we're through using them.

1130
01:07:12,796 --> 01:07:14,631
What's the matter, Lieutenant?
Can't you sleep?

1131
01:07:14,631 --> 01:07:15,632
Oh, yeah.

1132
01:07:15,841 --> 01:07:17,342
I'm waiting til she's undressed.

1133
01:07:17,426 --> 01:07:18,427
Just married?

1134
01:07:18,886 --> 01:07:19,845
Uh huh.

1135
01:07:19,887 --> 01:07:22,848
Oh yeah, but I mean no.
You don't understand.

1136
01:07:23,223 --> 01:07:25,559
Count to three, John. Then you can come in.

1137
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:43,994
Think I better go out and count some more.

1138
01:07:44,495 --> 01:07:46,038
Get to bed, Lieutenant.

1139
01:07:46,371 --> 01:07:47,372
Here.

1140
01:07:47,581 --> 01:07:50,751
Don't be so concerned. We're Navy men.

1141
01:07:52,753 --> 01:07:53,754
Okay.

1142
01:08:18,779 --> 01:08:19,780
Enson Benson?

1143
01:08:20,197 --> 01:08:21,198
Yeah.

1144
01:08:22,407 --> 01:08:25,202
I never thought I'd be
sharing a bedroom with you.

1145
01:08:25,452 --> 01:08:26,453
Uh, I mean...

1146
01:08:27,204 --> 01:08:28,580
I know what you mean.

1147
01:08:29,289 --> 01:08:30,958
Gee, and I had everything

1148
01:08:31,208 --> 01:08:32,459
perfectly arranged.

1149
01:08:33,418 --> 01:08:36,421
I was going to spend the
night with Prudence.

1150
01:08:36,839 --> 01:08:37,840
That's my wife.

1151
01:08:38,549 --> 01:08:39,550
I know.

1152
01:08:40,551 --> 01:08:44,555
Well, cheer up. You'll be back
with Prudence in the morning.

1153
01:08:47,182 --> 01:08:48,767
You know what's strange?

1154
01:08:49,017 --> 01:08:50,561
Here I am in my shorts.

1155
01:08:50,894 --> 01:08:51,937
That is strange.

1156
01:08:52,729 --> 01:08:55,107
No, no what I mean is
here I am in my shorts

1157
01:08:55,149 --> 01:08:57,401
with you before I'm in
my shorts with her.

1158
01:08:57,901 --> 01:08:58,902
What?

1159
01:08:59,403 --> 01:09:01,446
- Oh!
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1160
01:09:03,448 --> 01:09:05,784
Well, well, I'm trying to explain, see?

1161
01:09:05,784 --> 01:09:09,621
Oh, never mind, John. Just
hurry up and get into bed.

1162
01:09:10,247 --> 01:09:12,583
Well, that's what I mean, see.
Here I am hearing

1163
01:09:12,583 --> 01:09:14,918
you say that before I
ever heard her say it.

1164
01:09:17,504 --> 01:09:19,798
You mean you never...

1165
01:09:20,090 --> 01:09:21,091
Never.

1166
01:09:21,383 --> 01:09:23,010
It just isn't fair.

1167
01:09:23,302 --> 01:09:26,555
Have this happen to a
sweet, decent guy like you.

1168
01:09:26,847 --> 01:09:29,474
I'm not so sweet and I'm not so decent.

1169
01:09:30,184 --> 01:09:31,393
I am human.

1170
01:09:32,311 --> 01:09:35,105
And I've taken just about all I can stand.

1171
01:09:35,522 --> 01:09:37,858
Now, remember, John we're Navy men.

1172
01:09:38,358 --> 01:09:42,112
- Do you know what I have on my mind?
- Navy men.

1173
01:09:42,487 --> 01:09:46,366
- Do you know what I would like to do?
- What?

1174
01:09:47,034 --> 01:09:49,036
I would like to just...

1175
01:09:49,578 --> 01:09:53,707
Walk into that hearing and tell
them all to go jump in a lake!

1176
01:09:57,586 --> 01:09:58,670
What's so funny?

1177
01:09:59,546 --> 01:10:00,547
Nothing.

1178
01:10:01,340 --> 01:10:02,341
Nothing really.

1179
01:10:03,050 --> 01:10:04,843
You know something, mister?

1180
01:10:04,885 --> 01:10:08,555
Your wife is a very, very lucky girl.

1181
01:10:10,182 --> 01:10:11,767
Now go to bed!

1182
01:10:37,626 --> 01:10:41,046
<i>Seven o'clock folks. One
hour to Washington.</i>

1183
01:10:54,810 --> 01:10:55,811
John.

1184
01:10:55,852 --> 01:10:56,853
Uh.

1185
01:10:58,230 --> 01:10:59,231
John.

1186
01:10:59,398 --> 01:11:00,816
Yeah, Pru, I'm up, I'm up.

1187
01:11:00,941 --> 01:11:02,234
It's seven o'clock, John.

1188
01:11:02,442 --> 01:11:03,443
Seven o'clock.

1189
01:11:04,152 --> 01:11:06,655
Okay, Prudence, seven o'clock. I'm up.

1190
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:11,493
She's not Prudence.

1191
01:11:25,090 --> 01:11:27,759
Oh, never mind. Here it is. I've got it.

1192
01:11:44,860 --> 01:11:46,236
Ducky poo!

1193
01:11:46,445 --> 01:11:47,446
Prudence!

1194
01:11:47,946 --> 01:11:50,532
Mom! Well, this is a pleasant surprise.

1195
01:11:50,657 --> 01:11:52,034
I didn't think you'd get up this early.

1196
01:11:52,075 --> 01:11:54,453
I haven't been able to sleep
a wink since you left.

1197
01:11:54,536 --> 01:11:56,621
So, you really were in Florida.

1198
01:11:56,621 --> 01:11:59,374
- Well, of course. Where did you think. I...
- John, I think the first thing we should...

1199
01:11:59,958 --> 01:12:02,002
Oh, this must be Prudence.

1200
01:12:02,294 --> 01:12:03,295
And her mother.

1201
01:12:03,378 --> 01:12:05,881
It must? I mean it must. It is.

1202
01:12:06,048 --> 01:12:09,176
Well, John, aren't you going to
introduce us to the lovely lady?

1203
01:12:09,176 --> 01:12:11,094
Oh, she's not a lovely lady.
She's an Enson.

1204
01:12:11,136 --> 01:12:12,679
She's Enson Benson?

1205
01:12:12,929 --> 01:12:15,349
Why, yes, sweetheart. This is the
Enson that was working on me.

1206
01:12:15,390 --> 01:12:18,560
I mean I was working on her... no, what I
mean to say is we were working together.

1207
01:12:18,685 --> 01:12:21,104
Well, it hasn't all been drudgery, has it?

1208
01:12:21,396 --> 01:12:22,981
So, you're Enson Benson.

1209
01:12:23,231 --> 01:12:24,691
John has told me so...

1210
01:12:25,192 --> 01:12:26,610
so nothing about you.

1211
01:12:26,818 --> 01:12:30,864
Well, he's told me a lot about you
and he'll be all yours before long.

1212
01:12:31,948 --> 01:12:34,785
I'll phone our report in to Admiral Bludde.

1213
01:12:36,078 --> 01:12:37,871
What has she got? A twitch?

1214
01:12:37,913 --> 01:12:39,498
Why does she keep winking?

1215
01:12:39,539 --> 01:12:42,793
Oh, honey, she's just being
friendly, that's all.

1216
01:12:43,627 --> 01:12:45,462
A good guy, that Benson.

1217
01:12:46,713 --> 01:12:49,132
Well, what do you say we
go have some breakfast?

1218
01:12:49,466 --> 01:12:51,385
Goodbye, Lieutenant.
It's certainly has been

1219
01:12:51,468 --> 01:12:53,387
a pleasure having you
and the misses aboard.

1220
01:12:53,428 --> 01:12:56,807
Misses? You mean you two
actually did share a bedroom?

1221
01:12:56,848 --> 01:12:59,601
Oh, sweetheart, let me explain. It was
the only accommodation we can get.

1222
01:12:59,643 --> 01:13:02,687
Don't you understand? This is a
top military project. We just...

1223
01:13:02,771 --> 01:13:06,650
Oh, when I close my eyes I can
see your father standing here.

1224
01:13:06,817 --> 01:13:09,069
But he never told me a pip like this!

1225
01:13:09,152 --> 01:13:12,489
- John, how could you?
- It wasn't easy!

1226
01:13:12,614 --> 01:13:16,535
I've heard quite enough, Prudence.
I'm going back to Akron!

1227
01:13:17,035 --> 01:13:17,786
Uh!

1228
01:13:17,869 --> 01:13:19,871
- And I'm going with you!
- Prudence!

1229
01:13:20,038 --> 01:13:22,416
She was in a lower, I was in an upper.
I swear!

1230
01:13:22,499 --> 01:13:25,085
John, something terrible
has... has happened!

1231
01:13:25,085 --> 01:13:26,294
You're telling me.

1232
01:13:26,670 --> 01:13:29,798
Congressman Mandeville has found out that
the Admiral has been hiding you from him

1233
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:33,677
and he's as mad as a hornet. He's moved
the hearing up to today. 10 A.M.!

1234
01:13:33,718 --> 01:13:34,719
C'mon.

1235
01:13:34,803 --> 01:13:37,722
Oh, what more could happen?

1236
01:13:37,848 --> 01:13:39,266
What more?

1237
01:13:52,654 --> 01:13:53,655
Now, son.

1238
01:13:53,738 --> 01:13:56,491
I'm taking Enson Benson's
word on your character.

1239
01:13:56,741 --> 01:13:58,410
Now, don't worry. I'll stick by you.

1240
01:13:58,535 --> 01:13:59,995
Oh, thank you very much, sir.

1241
01:13:59,995 --> 01:14:02,080
- But, it's not going to do you any good.
- No?

1242
01:14:02,164 --> 01:14:04,040
Mandeville's out for your blood.

1243
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:06,209
During the war, he never
got higher than Ship's.

1244
01:14:06,251 --> 01:14:08,295
Cook 3rd class, and
he'll never forget it.

1245
01:14:08,879 --> 01:14:11,423
We better get inside, sir. Now,
Lieutenant, one last briefing.

1246
01:14:11,423 --> 01:14:12,174
Yes, sir.

1247
01:14:12,382 --> 01:14:16,136
When you face the committee whatever you
do, don't get flustered and don't panic.

1248
01:14:16,219 --> 01:14:18,096
Oh no, sir, I won't. I can handle it.

1249
01:14:18,096 --> 01:14:19,764
I won't pluster or fanic.

1250
01:14:20,348 --> 01:14:21,349
Easy, son.

1251
01:14:21,641 --> 01:14:22,851
Face it like a man.

1252
01:14:22,893 --> 01:14:24,186
Remember, you're Navy.

1253
01:14:24,269 --> 01:14:27,856
Yes, sir, I'm Mavy and I won't pluster
or fanic. How do you say that?

1254
01:14:27,898 --> 01:14:31,359
Oh, it's simple. Pluster or fanic.
Fanic or plust...

1255
01:14:31,818 --> 01:14:33,361
Never mind how you say it, just don't.

1256
01:14:33,403 --> 01:14:35,155
- No, I won't, sir.
- Let's get in there.

1257
01:14:36,281 --> 01:14:38,617
Good luck, John and keep a stiff upper lip.

1258
01:14:38,658 --> 01:14:42,204
Yeah, I will. I can't talk too good that
way, but if that's the way you want it.

1259
01:14:45,081 --> 01:14:47,918
I'm sorry, but the key isn't here.
Have you called the room?

1260
01:14:48,001 --> 01:14:49,878
I called the room and
there's no answer. I'm

1261
01:14:49,878 --> 01:14:52,506
telling you I gotta talk to Mrs.
Steckler.

1262
01:14:52,672 --> 01:14:53,924
Pardon me a moment.

1263
01:14:54,508 --> 01:14:59,221
Mother, I know I'm making the
wrong decision. John loves me.

1264
01:14:59,304 --> 01:15:01,848
If he did he'd have followed you here.

1265
01:15:01,890 --> 01:15:03,391
There she is now with her mother.

1266
01:15:03,475 --> 01:15:04,643
Oh, thanks a lot.

1267
01:15:05,936 --> 01:15:07,395
- Mrs. Steckler?
- Yes?

1268
01:15:08,313 --> 01:15:11,316
I'm Stan Wychinski. I was with your
husband on the ship that's missing.

1269
01:15:11,441 --> 01:15:12,442
The Kornblatt?

1270
01:15:12,567 --> 01:15:14,945
Uh, yes ma'am. That's what he came
down to Florida to see me about.

1271
01:15:14,986 --> 01:15:16,696
Then it was Navy business.

1272
01:15:16,696 --> 01:15:17,697
Oh, you bet.

1273
01:15:17,781 --> 01:15:20,116
Only last night, I couldn't
remember where it was.

1274
01:15:20,158 --> 01:15:22,702
And then when I did remember, he had left.

1275
01:15:22,786 --> 01:15:25,830
So, I beat it up here and now they
won't let me in at the hearing.

1276
01:15:26,039 --> 01:15:26,998
What hearing?

1277
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:28,375
Down at the Capital.

1278
01:15:28,667 --> 01:15:31,378
I figured you're his wife so you
could get a message to him. You see?

1279
01:15:31,586 --> 01:15:32,963
A message about what?

1280
01:15:33,004 --> 01:15:35,340
The Kornblatt. I think I know where it is.

1281
01:15:35,674 --> 01:15:38,843
Mr. Wychinski, you're a doll! C'mon.

1282
01:15:38,885 --> 01:15:40,762
Oh, the side door. This way.

1283
01:15:41,263 --> 01:15:43,348
The hearing will come to order.

1284
01:15:47,519 --> 01:15:51,356
First, I would like to point out that
this is not a trial nor a court Marshall.

1285
01:15:51,356 --> 01:15:54,150
It is merely an investigation
into the mysterious

1286
01:15:54,192 --> 01:15:58,196
disappearance of a United
States naval vessel.

1287
01:15:58,822 --> 01:16:00,699
A destroyer escort.

1288
01:16:01,116 --> 01:16:02,492
Or was it subversion?

1289
01:16:02,993 --> 01:16:03,994
Espionage.

1290
01:16:04,244 --> 01:16:07,539
A foreign agent threatening
our nation's security.

1291
01:16:08,081 --> 01:16:09,082
I ask you.

1292
01:16:09,708 --> 01:16:12,544
Is that the face of an honest man?

1293
01:16:13,128 --> 01:16:14,421
I ask you.

1294
01:16:20,719 --> 01:16:22,762
I ask you.

1295
01:16:22,846 --> 01:16:27,684
That is what we're here to find out
in free and democratic process.

1296
01:16:28,351 --> 01:16:30,895
Do you want to come clean, Lieutenant?

1297
01:16:45,910 --> 01:16:49,247
Gentlemen, I am convinced that Lieutenant
Steckler is telling the truth.

1298
01:16:49,372 --> 01:16:52,334
And that he's just the victim
of unfortunate circumstances.

1299
01:16:52,417 --> 01:16:54,419
Ms. Benson, are you
quite sure this is

1300
01:16:54,419 --> 01:16:56,838
the Navy officer talking
and not the woman?

1301
01:16:56,838 --> 01:16:57,797
Yes, sir!

1302
01:16:57,881 --> 01:17:00,342
Isn't it true that you
and Lieutenant Steckler

1303
01:17:00,342 --> 01:17:02,761
shared a compartment
coming back from Florida?

1304
01:17:05,013 --> 01:17:09,225
- What, yes, but what' that got to do...
- That will be all Ms. Benson.

1305
01:17:17,567 --> 01:17:22,906
I promise you Admiral, I won't rest until
I see this man, Steckler, behind bars!

1306
01:17:25,033 --> 01:17:28,370
Get rid of those things,
they're driving me crazy!

1307
01:17:31,164 --> 01:17:33,416
That's the way the ball bounces.

1308
01:17:36,878 --> 01:17:39,381
This is no laughing matter, young man.

1309
01:17:39,714 --> 01:17:44,260
I want the United States protected
from your kind of criminal negligence.

1310
01:17:44,260 --> 01:17:45,845
Now, see here Congressman.

1311
01:17:45,887 --> 01:17:49,974
Lieutenant Steckler is a Naval officer and
I want him treated as a Naval officer!

1312
01:17:55,105 --> 01:17:58,066
If the Chief himself hadn't ordered
me to cooperate with this committee

1313
01:17:58,233 --> 01:18:00,443
I'd have hung up on your
very first phone call.

1314
01:18:00,527 --> 01:18:02,737
Don't take my part, sir.

1315
01:18:04,364 --> 01:18:06,908
Are you sure that's where the Kornblatt is?

1316
01:18:07,158 --> 01:18:08,159
Well...

1317
01:18:08,576 --> 01:18:09,703
I think I'm sure.

1318
01:18:10,286 --> 01:18:11,287
I mean...

1319
01:18:12,038 --> 01:18:14,332
Well, what's the difference?
What have we got to lose?

1320
01:18:14,332 --> 01:18:15,500
It's a long shot.

1321
01:18:15,917 --> 01:18:16,918
A gamble.

1322
01:18:17,293 --> 01:18:19,295
But, you're right. What
have we got to lose?

1323
01:18:19,421 --> 01:18:21,589
- I'll see if I can get an adjournment.
- Good deal.

1324
01:18:21,589 --> 01:18:24,509
I consider it my sacred
duty to dig through

1325
01:18:24,551 --> 01:18:26,928
all the lies and evasion
until I get the truth!

1326
01:18:32,350 --> 01:18:33,351
Congressman.

1327
01:18:33,893 --> 01:18:36,271
I'd like to request an
adjournment for 48 hours.

1328
01:18:36,438 --> 01:18:37,439
Prudence!

1329
01:18:37,605 --> 01:18:38,648
Where are you going?

1330
01:18:38,982 --> 01:18:39,858
That's my wife.

1331
01:18:39,899 --> 01:18:40,734
I'd like to request an
adjournment for 48 hours.

1332
01:18:40,775 --> 01:18:43,862
Who let those people in here?
This is a crime!

1333
01:18:44,028 --> 01:18:45,488
This is my wife, Prudence.

1334
01:18:45,488 --> 01:18:46,489
An adjournment for 43 hours!

1335
01:18:46,531 --> 01:18:48,908
Forget it. Forget it. Forget it!

1336
01:18:48,908 --> 01:18:50,410
Shake her hand.

1337
01:18:51,202 --> 01:18:52,704
I'm sorry I asked.

1338
01:18:53,329 --> 01:18:55,665
Hearing adjourned for 43 hours.

1339
01:19:12,348 --> 01:19:15,685
All I remember is, this Lieutenant J.G.
says to me

1340
01:19:15,685 --> 01:19:19,939
they'll be using the old girl for target
practice. She's going to a watery grave.

1341
01:19:20,023 --> 01:19:23,902
Yeah, well according to these old bombing
records, we ought to be right in the area.

1342
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:27,280
Say, Cockson, head due west.

1343
01:19:28,656 --> 01:19:29,657
East?

1344
01:19:30,325 --> 01:19:31,326
I meant east.

1345
01:19:44,422 --> 01:19:48,927
Even if we do find a ship down there, we
still need evidence it's the Kornblatt.

1346
01:19:49,052 --> 01:19:50,053
Uh huh.

1347
01:20:34,097 --> 01:20:35,098
I'm dying!

1348
01:20:35,306 --> 01:20:36,307
Wychinski!

1349
01:20:36,683 --> 01:20:37,684
Stan!

1350
01:20:38,268 --> 01:20:40,270
Stuck!

1351
01:20:43,773 --> 01:20:47,235
What are you doing with
your head down there?

1352
01:20:48,069 --> 01:20:50,280
Get your head out of there!

1353
01:20:51,406 --> 01:20:54,075
Get your head out of there!

1354
01:21:39,287 --> 01:21:42,123
You are nuts.

1355
01:23:06,833 --> 01:23:07,834
Wow!

1356
01:23:32,692 --> 01:23:34,736
The Kornblatt!

1357
01:23:57,341 --> 01:23:59,093
You tapped my shoulder.

1358
01:24:00,344 --> 01:24:01,846
Back to work.

1359
01:24:03,014 --> 01:24:04,223
Okay.

1360
01:24:15,401 --> 01:24:17,987
Now wait a minute! Not!

1361
01:24:18,154 --> 01:24:19,155
Not!

1362
01:25:05,910 --> 01:25:08,079
Turn around! Turn around!

1363
01:25:08,079 --> 01:25:11,040
Octopus! Octopus!

1364
01:25:11,124 --> 01:25:14,293
Turn around! Turn around!

1365
01:25:15,336 --> 01:25:16,504
Turn around!

1366
01:25:19,465 --> 01:25:21,300
There's an octopus!

1367
01:25:41,487 --> 01:25:44,115
And I submit this bell,
gentlemen, as definite

1368
01:25:44,115 --> 01:25:46,534
proof that the Kornblatt
has been found.

1369
01:25:47,201 --> 01:25:50,329
Yes, it's all beginning
to come back to me now.

1370
01:25:50,830 --> 01:25:52,957
Congressman, may I borrow
your phone for a moment?

1371
01:25:52,999 --> 01:25:54,000
Oh, certainly.

1372
01:25:54,458 --> 01:25:57,712
I think the Chief himself might
know something about this.

1373
01:25:59,213 --> 01:26:02,884
Admiral Bludde, priority number 3-2-0.
Put me through to the Chief.

1374
01:26:03,885 --> 01:26:07,763
Chief? Lieutenant Steckler came through.
We found the Kornblatt.

1375
01:26:09,223 --> 01:26:12,101
Well, right where you left it, sir.
The deep six.

1376
01:26:12,476 --> 01:26:16,439
Chief, weren't you in charge of that
joint gunnery operation some years back?

1377
01:26:16,647 --> 01:26:17,815
Yes, I thought so.

1378
01:26:18,608 --> 01:26:19,609
What's that?

1379
01:26:19,901 --> 01:26:21,068
Yes, sir, just a moment.

1380
01:26:21,110 --> 01:26:22,111
Lieutenant?

1381
01:26:22,153 --> 01:26:23,154
Yes, sir.

1382
01:26:23,196 --> 01:26:25,615
- He wants to talk to you.
- Me? The Chief?

1383
01:26:27,491 --> 01:26:30,870
How do you do, sir? Lieutenant John
Paul Steckler VII on this end.

1384
01:26:30,870 --> 01:26:32,914
- How's everything on your end?
- Lieutenant.

1385
01:26:32,955 --> 01:26:34,457
Oh, he's laughing, sir.

1386
01:26:35,166 --> 01:26:37,460
Uh, yes, what's on your mind, sir?

1387
01:26:39,003 --> 01:26:39,962
Yes, sir.

1388
01:26:40,838 --> 01:26:41,839
Mandeville was?

1389
01:26:43,966 --> 01:26:44,967
He really was?

1390
01:26:45,718 --> 01:26:47,511
- He was what?
- I was what?

1391
01:26:48,179 --> 01:26:50,681
Well, yes, that is. That's
quite amusing, sir.

1392
01:26:50,681 --> 01:26:51,682
Yes.

1393
01:26:52,183 --> 01:26:54,894
More or less as they say, "rib-tickling".

1394
01:26:56,604 --> 01:26:59,440
Yes, sir. Well, my very best to the family.

1395
01:26:59,982 --> 01:27:01,192
Yes, sir. Goodbye.

1396
01:27:01,943 --> 01:27:05,196
- And you, Congressman.
- Yes? Yes?

1397
01:27:05,363 --> 01:27:09,700
When you were in charge of the
Emergency Crash Committee in '46

1398
01:27:09,700 --> 01:27:14,622
you told the Chief to take just any old
ship and use it for target practice

1399
01:27:14,622 --> 01:27:17,083
and blow it up and hang the red tape.

1400
01:27:17,083 --> 01:27:20,419
Well, uh, yes now that you
mention it, I did say

1401
01:27:20,461 --> 01:27:22,421
something like that, didn't I?

1402
01:27:22,546 --> 01:27:26,425
Now, we wouldn't want this to get
out into the press, now would we?

1403
01:27:26,425 --> 01:27:28,094
- Oh, no!
- Oh, no.

1404
01:27:28,344 --> 01:27:31,639
And we don't want to cut Navy
appropriations, either, do we?

1405
01:27:31,681 --> 01:27:33,057
- Never!
- No.

1406
01:27:33,349 --> 01:27:36,894
Oh, say, by the way Admiral, uh,
you think four billion is enough?

1407
01:27:36,936 --> 01:27:38,229
Plenty, Lieutenant. Plenty.

1408
01:27:38,229 --> 01:27:42,024
Why don't we just tack on another
mil for contingency.

1409
01:27:42,316 --> 01:27:44,360
Oh, of course, of course.

1410
01:27:44,777 --> 01:27:45,778
Uh, the...

1411
01:27:46,237 --> 01:27:47,613
hearing is adjourned.

1412
01:27:50,116 --> 01:27:51,117
Careful.

1413
01:27:53,035 --> 01:27:54,120
Congratulations.

1414
01:28:11,762 --> 01:28:12,763
- Darling.
- Oh!

1415
01:28:14,140 --> 01:28:15,141
Sweetie face.

1416
01:28:15,182 --> 01:28:16,183
Poochie pie.

1417
01:28:16,392 --> 01:28:18,561
Here's the moment we've been waiting for.

1418
01:28:18,811 --> 01:28:19,812
Oh no!

1419
01:28:20,187 --> 01:28:23,149
Don't you worry, honey. Nobody's
going to stop us this time!

1420
01:28:23,190 --> 01:28:24,567
I guarantee you!
