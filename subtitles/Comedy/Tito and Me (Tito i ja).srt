1
00:02:12,392 --> 00:02:14,918
I love my house.

2
00:02:14,962 --> 00:02:16,931
It consists of one room...

3
00:02:16,965 --> 00:02:21,404
that belongs only
to me and my parents...

4
00:02:21,438 --> 00:02:23,406
of another one which is...

5
00:02:23,441 --> 00:02:26,445
unfortunately occupied by
my aunt, my uncle...

6
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,543
and my hideous cousin, Svetlana.

7
00:02:30,618 --> 00:02:32,985
The antechamber
is the most beautiful room...

8
00:02:33,021 --> 00:02:34,990
of the whole flat.

9
00:02:35,024 --> 00:02:37,594
This is where
my grandmother lives.

10
00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:39,562
Everyone goes in and out...

11
00:02:39,597 --> 00:02:41,589
slamming doors
and stamping their feet.

12
00:02:42,074 --> 00:02:44,043
Unfortunately
she sleeps lightly...

13
00:02:44,077 --> 00:02:46,410
and jumps at
the slightest noise.

14
00:02:47,548 --> 00:02:50,383
It is you, Zoran.

15
00:02:53,557 --> 00:02:55,116
It is in the living room...

16
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:57,651
that Grandma
keeps her sewing machine...

17
00:02:57,696 --> 00:03:03,330
the dowry for
her marriage with Him.

18
00:03:03,372 --> 00:03:07,366
She only talks about Grandfather
in terms of pronouns.

19
00:03:08,139 --> 00:03:12,202
The bathroom, the toilet,
the larder...

20
00:03:12,245 --> 00:03:15,704
and the kitchen
are common rooms.

21
00:03:15,749 --> 00:03:18,344
We use them in turns.

22
00:03:18,386 --> 00:03:22,984
The kitchen is my favorite.

23
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:26,998
When cakes are being baked
for different holidays...

24
00:03:27,032 --> 00:03:35,136
Grandma always lets me lick
the bowls and casseroles.

25
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,165
My parents are artists.

26
00:03:42,201 --> 00:03:47,140
My mother is a ballerina
and practices in the theater...

27
00:03:47,175 --> 00:03:50,738
whereas my father
has to practice in our room...

28
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,614
the only living space we have.

29
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:55,779
You're driving us mad!

30
00:03:55,821 --> 00:03:59,224
Aren't you ready?

31
00:03:59,259 --> 00:04:01,660
What?

32
00:04:03,098 --> 00:04:04,896
Slut.

33
00:04:05,902 --> 00:04:07,995
With such a mother...

34
00:04:08,038 --> 00:04:11,635
Considering her job...

35
00:04:11,797 --> 00:04:16,361
A permanent tension reigns
between the two families.

36
00:04:16,403 --> 00:04:19,032
According to Dad,
there is no such a conflict...

37
00:04:19,074 --> 00:04:23,445
that can't be resolved
in a polite manner.

38
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,815
- Come out.
- Why?

39
00:04:26,852 --> 00:04:31,257
To tell me what it is you object
to my wife's behavior.

40
00:04:33,996 --> 00:04:38,367
Leave us in peace!

41
00:04:38,402 --> 00:04:40,234
What's wrong
with being a ballerina?

42
00:04:40,272 --> 00:04:43,436
Bunch of primitive
and insolent idiots!

43
00:04:43,476 --> 00:04:45,138
Insolent?

44
00:04:50,186 --> 00:04:52,621
The kid is looking at you!

45
00:05:12,184 --> 00:05:14,085
Enough.

46
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,884
Help me in the kitchen.

47
00:05:17,993 --> 00:05:21,361
After this quite usual row...

48
00:05:21,397 --> 00:05:24,367
they spent the whole afternoon
frying peppers...

49
00:05:24,401 --> 00:05:26,529
as if nothing
had happened at all.

50
00:05:26,571 --> 00:05:28,130
But Daddy,
completely disgusted...

51
00:05:28,174 --> 00:05:34,241
took the clarinet away with him,
to never bring it back again.

52
00:05:38,356 --> 00:05:40,157
Hello, dear.

53
00:05:40,192 --> 00:05:44,129
However, one member
of our family lives all alone.

54
00:05:44,164 --> 00:05:47,329
Grandfather
has never lived with us...

55
00:05:47,369 --> 00:05:53,207
because Grandma had
thrown him out before the war.

56
00:05:56,716 --> 00:05:57,978
Is your father in?

57
00:05:59,119 --> 00:06:01,179
And your mother?

58
00:06:02,523 --> 00:06:04,788
How's school?

59
00:06:06,396 --> 00:06:11,335
Grandpa comes around often,
always about noon.

60
00:06:11,369 --> 00:06:14,397
At lunchtime, as it happens!

61
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,135
Me first.

62
00:06:17,178 --> 00:06:20,114
No, me. I am more important!

63
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:32,430
You are as fresh
as a French maid.

64
00:06:35,471 --> 00:06:38,909
He doesn't even
buy his own paper.

65
00:06:42,181 --> 00:06:45,151
Our meals are financed
by Grandma.

66
00:06:45,185 --> 00:06:48,554
The money comes from
the inheritance...

67
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:51,158
her father had left her.

68
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:59,166
She's doesn't really mean it.

69
00:07:03,311 --> 00:07:06,282
It is with great sadness
that Grandma...

70
00:07:06,316 --> 00:07:09,286
recalls the last words
of her father...

71
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,689
"This is something
you can live on...

72
00:07:12,725 --> 00:07:15,729
"when that yobbo leaves you. "

73
00:07:15,764 --> 00:07:17,789
Enjoy your meal.

74
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,339
Zoran...

75
00:07:23,373 --> 00:07:25,342
don't eat so quickly.

76
00:07:26,678 --> 00:07:29,209
I have always been plump.

77
00:07:29,244 --> 00:07:31,741
Grandma says "rounded"...

78
00:07:31,786 --> 00:07:37,090
and my cousin Svetlana,
naturally, "fatty," "obese. "

79
00:07:37,127 --> 00:07:39,095
Once she used an expression...

80
00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:44,263
she couldn't have
invented herself...

81
00:07:44,304 --> 00:07:47,399
You are a fat "degenerate"!

82
00:07:47,442 --> 00:07:50,845
Mummy, he's broken our jam jar!

83
00:07:52,148 --> 00:07:54,549
My uncle said the same thing...

84
00:07:54,585 --> 00:07:57,146
when he caught me
eating the wall.

85
00:07:57,189 --> 00:08:02,095
I couldn't explain that
irresistible urge to taste it.

86
00:08:03,665 --> 00:08:08,195
He was the only one
to have noticed the holes.

87
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:16,481
He is also very fascinated
by weird phenomena.

88
00:09:24,215 --> 00:09:27,675
Thus that word slipped out.

89
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,282
You are not...
You are a degenerate!

90
00:09:31,325 --> 00:09:35,525
According to my uncle, the loo
is the "crisis generator. "

91
00:09:35,564 --> 00:09:39,969
Will you ever learn to air?

92
00:09:42,007 --> 00:09:44,704
Why don't you
ever close the door?

93
00:09:44,744 --> 00:09:47,715
This uncle's thought
could be explained...

94
00:09:47,749 --> 00:09:51,277
by the fact that one
has to pass through the loo...

95
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,291
to get into the bathroom
and vice-versa.

96
00:09:54,325 --> 00:09:57,887
It's nothing.

97
00:10:03,872 --> 00:10:05,431
Who's used the hot water?

98
00:10:05,475 --> 00:10:08,639
Zoran, is it you in there?

99
00:10:12,985 --> 00:10:17,447
Mum and her colleagues often
dance for Comrade Tito...

100
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:20,018
during his hunting balls.

101
00:10:20,062 --> 00:10:26,732
As a sign of gratitude,
he offers them the game.

102
00:10:42,761 --> 00:10:44,127
- What?
- Over there!

103
00:10:44,331 --> 00:10:47,062
- Calm down!
- Over there!

104
00:10:47,101 --> 00:10:49,969
For goodness sake! What?

105
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,007
Delicious.

106
00:10:55,547 --> 00:10:58,745
Venison has
a rather disgusting taste...

107
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:01,812
but we all pretend
to savor it...

108
00:11:01,889 --> 00:11:04,859
since it can only be seen
in movies...

109
00:11:04,893 --> 00:11:07,880
and on the tables
of grand seigneurs.

110
00:11:07,915 --> 00:11:10,834
In order to forget
what I'm eating...

111
00:11:10,869 --> 00:11:15,399
I imagine Comrade Tito facing up
all these wild beasts.

112
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:19,369
What is Comrade Tito like?

113
00:11:21,885 --> 00:11:24,946
I wouldn't really know.

114
00:11:26,859 --> 00:11:31,457
First of all, they search you
from top to bottom.

115
00:11:31,499 --> 00:11:33,730
- Is that so?
- Yes, Vlado.

116
00:11:33,769 --> 00:11:36,534
Then they don't take
their eyes off us...

117
00:11:36,572 --> 00:11:38,700
with their fingers
on the triggers.

118
00:11:38,742 --> 00:11:40,210
Or in the nose.

119
00:11:40,412 --> 00:11:45,579
In the end, he is literally
invaded by his ass-lickers.

120
00:11:45,619 --> 00:11:48,145
We are eating!

121
00:11:48,189 --> 00:11:50,715
Are the communists
fighting over the feast?

122
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:52,557
Daddy!

123
00:11:52,595 --> 00:11:58,798
Then some guy with a mustache
from the Protocol Office...

124
00:11:58,838 --> 00:12:00,238
gives away the catch...

125
00:12:00,441 --> 00:12:03,809
after Tito's picture
has been taken...

126
00:12:03,845 --> 00:12:05,473
in the middle of his game.

127
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:10,053
So finally we get it all...
us, the staff...

128
00:12:10,087 --> 00:12:12,613
not to waste anything.

129
00:12:12,658 --> 00:12:15,891
Yes, his working class.

130
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:18,229
Stop elbowing me.

131
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:29,482
Summertime in Belgrade
is beautiful.

132
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:31,917
We go to
the "Students' beach"...

133
00:12:31,953 --> 00:12:34,488
the Army swimming pool...

134
00:12:34,523 --> 00:12:37,527
but it is no good there because
the soldiers piss in it...

135
00:12:37,562 --> 00:12:40,498
and we also have the Danube.

136
00:12:54,051 --> 00:12:56,885
Do you need help?

137
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:58,838
No. Enjoy yourselves.

138
00:13:08,993 --> 00:13:11,555
Has your father
always been working here?

139
00:13:11,597 --> 00:13:15,261
No. Only since
he got out of jail.

140
00:13:15,302 --> 00:13:16,964
The Central Prison?

141
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:19,474
No. A clink somewhere at sea.

142
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:24,413
What is your vocation?

143
00:13:24,448 --> 00:13:25,814
History of Art.

144
00:13:25,851 --> 00:13:28,844
You know what that is?

145
00:13:28,888 --> 00:13:32,451
Why don't you do your job, then?

146
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:35,655
He knows why.

147
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:40,560
Who, God?

148
00:13:41,707 --> 00:13:44,472
You know God doesn't exist,
do you?

149
00:13:46,347 --> 00:13:49,545
In this country, there is
someone more important than God.

150
00:13:50,653 --> 00:13:52,645
Do you understand?

151
00:13:55,694 --> 00:13:58,095
You will one day.

152
00:13:59,433 --> 00:14:00,901
Maybe.

153
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,811
We always sneak in the cinemas.

154
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,821
I like to sit in the back...

155
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:17,518
on my own, to get away.

156
00:14:25,049 --> 00:14:31,753
The masses have gathered
to greet Marshal Tito.

157
00:14:31,792 --> 00:14:37,255
He seems very pleased
with the joyous acclamations.

158
00:14:47,214 --> 00:14:49,308
Who was that?

159
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:52,343
Not us!

160
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:04,271
Let's get out. The film is shit!

161
00:15:36,819 --> 00:15:39,345
No foreign delegation...

162
00:15:39,389 --> 00:15:42,792
has ever been
greeted so warmly...

163
00:15:42,828 --> 00:15:45,354
as was Marshal Tito
and his delegation.

164
00:15:45,398 --> 00:15:51,361
At this moment,
Marshal Tito marches past...

165
00:15:51,406 --> 00:15:58,212
the National Guard, accompanied
by the regimental band.

166
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:03,246
Tito's Blue Train
comes into sight.

167
00:16:04,592 --> 00:16:09,931
The colors of Yugoslavia...

168
00:16:09,967 --> 00:16:11,959
and the small flags leap out...

169
00:16:24,454 --> 00:16:26,616
You are nothing but
a bunch of dirty communists.

170
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:31,631
What?

171
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:34,894
Why is Zoran
gluing Tito's picture, then?

172
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:44,845
Answer! Look up!

173
00:16:44,884 --> 00:16:47,217
What are we?

174
00:16:47,254 --> 00:16:48,984
Dirty communists.

175
00:16:49,023 --> 00:16:52,552
And you, you are a bunch of
dirty capitalists.

176
00:16:52,596 --> 00:16:56,192
Now go and repeat it.

177
00:17:00,073 --> 00:17:02,269
She slapped me!

178
00:17:02,309 --> 00:17:05,108
- Who?
- Auntie!

179
00:17:05,146 --> 00:17:08,208
On the head?

180
00:17:11,923 --> 00:17:14,222
Don't you ever touch
my little girl again!

181
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:17,698
And you, knock before entering!

182
00:18:03,732 --> 00:18:08,330
Love is the most complicated
thing in the world.

183
00:18:08,372 --> 00:18:12,674
It creates a lot of problems
for the grownups.

184
00:18:24,362 --> 00:18:27,764
Like when Daddy was hired
as a repetiteur...

185
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:31,737
by Matilda,
the diva with the big tits.

186
00:18:38,348 --> 00:18:41,443
Mirjana, no!

187
00:18:57,442 --> 00:19:00,811
Matilda's ears
kept buzzing for six days...

188
00:19:00,847 --> 00:19:05,047
the premiere of the
"Queen of Spade" was canceled...

189
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:09,526
and Daddy was sacked
on the spot.

190
00:19:42,008 --> 00:19:46,845
Then he had to work as
a saxophonist in a night bar.

191
00:19:46,882 --> 00:19:49,852
Auntie says, considering
the number of whores involved...

192
00:19:49,886 --> 00:19:52,651
there is no difference...

193
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:57,562
between the National Theater
and that bar.

194
00:19:57,597 --> 00:20:00,863
That is why Mummy
waits for Daddy every night...

195
00:20:00,902 --> 00:20:07,538
and they come home
later and later.

196
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:01,912
Who knows what
you're doing in that dump...

197
00:21:01,956 --> 00:21:04,221
with all those whores!

198
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:16,536
And a singer again!

199
00:21:16,578 --> 00:21:18,513
She has no voice at all!

200
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:44,981
So?

201
00:21:45,018 --> 00:21:48,820
Isn't it obvious?

202
00:21:48,858 --> 00:21:51,054
It is a love letter.

203
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,658
Right?

204
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,532
So what?

205
00:21:56,569 --> 00:21:59,004
What do you mean, "so what"?

206
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,634
Tell me, what does it prove?

207
00:22:01,676 --> 00:22:05,978
I don't make this dancer
write to me.

208
00:22:06,016 --> 00:22:08,918
Nothing has happened between us.

209
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:14,553
He wants nothing in return.

210
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:27,775
Do you know how many letters
I've received?

211
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:31,273
Ten, fifteen letters!

212
00:22:31,639 --> 00:22:34,871
And I've kept only this one!

213
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:36,344
Do you know why?

214
00:22:36,379 --> 00:22:37,847
Silence!

215
00:22:37,882 --> 00:22:39,281
Because it is nice!

216
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:41,878
Come on, you are overdoing it!

217
00:22:41,921 --> 00:22:46,360
Have you seen the time?

218
00:22:46,394 --> 00:22:51,959
We can never sleep in peace!

219
00:22:54,171 --> 00:22:58,542
Don't touch me. Don't touch me.

220
00:22:58,578 --> 00:23:00,547
You know that I love you.

221
00:23:00,581 --> 00:23:02,277
Of course I do.

222
00:23:22,579 --> 00:23:24,113
Love creates a variety...

223
00:23:24,148 --> 00:23:28,553
of insoluble problems
for the grownups.

224
00:23:28,621 --> 00:23:33,060
It's not any simpler
with the younger ones.

225
00:23:35,064 --> 00:23:38,763
I realized that
the day I met Jasna.

226
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:40,700
Thank you. Good-bye.

227
00:23:40,739 --> 00:23:43,174
My pleasure.

228
00:23:43,209 --> 00:23:45,610
See you tomorrow.

229
00:23:45,646 --> 00:23:49,607
There's no need
to walk me back any longer.

230
00:23:49,652 --> 00:23:51,210
Why?

231
00:23:51,253 --> 00:23:54,986
Because you are younger
and shorter than me.

232
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:55,232
It is not true!

233
00:23:55,748 --> 00:23:58,582
Only since Christmas
I've gained four centimeters.

234
00:23:58,619 --> 00:23:59,780
Christmas!

235
00:24:02,391 --> 00:24:05,919
You go talking about
the joy of a happy family again.

236
00:24:05,962 --> 00:24:08,933
The problem is not my size...

237
00:24:08,967 --> 00:24:11,937
but the fact that
Jasna is a war orphan.

238
00:24:11,971 --> 00:24:16,933
Her parents died
during the war...

239
00:24:16,978 --> 00:24:21,974
and she lives in an orphanage.

240
00:24:27,027 --> 00:24:28,153
Children...

241
00:24:28,362 --> 00:24:33,564
the life of young Tito
wasn't easy at all.

242
00:24:33,603 --> 00:24:39,009
He had to get up very early
and go to bed very late.

243
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:42,743
The young Tito had
to take the cows to pasture...

244
00:24:42,783 --> 00:24:47,154
and a horse
by the name of Pootko.

245
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:49,552
I quote Comrade Tito...

246
00:24:49,593 --> 00:24:52,859
What are you staring at?

247
00:24:52,897 --> 00:24:55,868
I quote...

248
00:24:55,262 --> 00:25:03,297
"... Pootko obeyed only me. "

249
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:08,906
In those days, no money,
and therefore no trousers.

250
00:25:08,948 --> 00:25:13,785
But it didn't bother young Tito
to play without any trousers on.

251
00:25:13,822 --> 00:25:17,088
He had three favorite games.

252
00:25:17,126 --> 00:25:21,997
Here's one of them.

253
00:26:02,358 --> 00:26:05,557
Zoran!
Do you want me to throw you out?

254
00:26:10,303 --> 00:26:15,265
The father of my friend Djura
is in the police...

255
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:20,272
and he keeps a gun behind
each and every radiator...

256
00:26:20,317 --> 00:26:23,379
of their flat.

257
00:26:23,422 --> 00:26:27,120
You are going out on a mission?
This late?

258
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:31,394
Get off my back.
You know I can't talk about it.

259
00:26:31,433 --> 00:26:32,400
Of course!

260
00:26:32,435 --> 00:26:36,999
I do know where you are off to!

261
00:26:41,181 --> 00:26:43,412
Why are you
taking the gun with you?

262
00:26:43,451 --> 00:26:47,218
To chase the bandits.

263
00:26:47,256 --> 00:26:50,159
Or someone else.

264
00:26:50,194 --> 00:26:54,257
Do you know who will pass by
the neighborhood tomorrow?

265
00:26:54,301 --> 00:26:56,235
The Emperor.

266
00:26:56,269 --> 00:26:57,669
Who?

267
00:26:58,665 --> 00:27:01,601
The Emperor of Ethiopia!

268
00:27:01,636 --> 00:27:03,696
So what?

269
00:27:03,939 --> 00:27:06,432
And who is going to be with him
in his limousine?

270
00:27:06,477 --> 00:27:09,606
The Marshal in person!

271
00:27:12,451 --> 00:27:15,769
I couldn't fall asleep
that night.

272
00:27:15,804 --> 00:27:19,086
I had to snatch
this opportunity.

273
00:27:19,128 --> 00:27:22,622
I was worried because
Djura's father had said...

274
00:27:22,667 --> 00:27:25,330
a huge crowd will come
to greet Comrade Tito.

275
00:27:28,041 --> 00:27:33,003
If we don't take into
consideration our local loony...

276
00:27:33,048 --> 00:27:40,356
there wasn't a single soul
on the streets.

277
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:42,953
Hey, kiddy!

278
00:27:52,176 --> 00:27:54,475
Some cutie!

279
00:28:00,187 --> 00:28:02,623
Where are you going so late?

280
00:28:02,658 --> 00:28:05,457
To wait for Comrade Tito.

281
00:28:06,796 --> 00:28:08,492
Tito? Really?

282
00:28:11,336 --> 00:28:12,497
That's a good boy.

283
00:28:29,295 --> 00:28:32,391
He's back!

284
00:28:34,303 --> 00:28:36,738
Silence!

285
00:28:36,254 --> 00:28:38,314
Bumming around?

286
00:28:49,038 --> 00:28:51,166
Where were you?

287
00:28:51,208 --> 00:28:55,806
By the bridge, around the port,
and at the market.

288
00:28:55,849 --> 00:28:58,683
What were you
doing there all night?

289
00:28:58,719 --> 00:29:00,620
I was waiting for Comrade Tito.

290
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:04,559
Who?

291
00:29:04,594 --> 00:29:05,823
Comrade Tito.

292
00:29:05,863 --> 00:29:09,824
He was to pass by the
neighborhood with the Emperor...

293
00:29:09,869 --> 00:29:13,772
so I wanted to get myself
a good place.

294
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,616
Have you seen
Comrade Tito's big ring?

295
00:29:46,859 --> 00:29:49,954
It is a wedding ring.
It means that he is married.

296
00:29:53,135 --> 00:29:56,469
Do all married people
have to wear one?

297
00:29:56,506 --> 00:30:03,415
No. Only those who want to show
their attachment to someone.

298
00:30:09,592 --> 00:30:11,356
See you tomorrow.

299
00:30:12,462 --> 00:30:17,869
There's no need
to walk me back any longer.

300
00:30:17,904 --> 00:30:19,337
Why?

301
00:30:19,372 --> 00:30:23,037
I shall be leaving soon.

302
00:30:23,078 --> 00:30:24,671
Where are you going?

303
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:28,777
On a "March Around
Tito's Homeland. "

304
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,789
For how long?

305
00:30:30,823 --> 00:30:33,554
A fortnight.

306
00:30:33,594 --> 00:30:34,619
What?

307
00:31:01,033 --> 00:31:04,027
Why are you not eating
your doughnuts?

308
00:31:04,072 --> 00:31:06,064
I can't, thank you.

309
00:31:06,108 --> 00:31:08,600
Those are your favorite, though.

310
00:31:13,618 --> 00:31:15,587
He's even refusing
his doughnuts.

311
00:31:15,621 --> 00:31:16,918
Is he feeling all right?

312
00:31:16,956 --> 00:31:19,448
It is love that torments him.

313
00:31:19,493 --> 00:31:22,055
The name of
his sweetheart is Jasna.

314
00:31:22,098 --> 00:31:23,360
She's pubescent.

315
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:25,493
It is not
the sort of thing one says.

316
00:31:25,535 --> 00:31:26,628
She's got tits!

317
00:31:26,671 --> 00:31:27,865
What did you say?

318
00:31:41,125 --> 00:31:44,927
Where do we register
for that March?

319
00:31:44,964 --> 00:31:47,525
It is not that easy.

320
00:31:47,567 --> 00:31:51,938
You think that anyone can go?

321
00:31:51,974 --> 00:31:56,879
How to become
a member of the elite?

322
00:31:56,914 --> 00:31:58,007
Quite simple.

323
00:31:58,049 --> 00:32:02,715
The best amongst the best
pioneers will be chosen.

324
00:32:08,396 --> 00:32:09,658
Thank you.

325
00:32:11,667 --> 00:32:12,760
When do I see you again?

326
00:32:12,802 --> 00:32:17,298
Sorry, but this trip
will take up all my time.

327
00:32:17,342 --> 00:32:20,210
We'd better break up now.

328
00:32:20,246 --> 00:32:21,714
What?

329
00:32:21,749 --> 00:32:24,981
I won't forget you.

330
00:32:32,698 --> 00:32:34,188
Good-bye.

331
00:32:49,922 --> 00:32:51,447
What is that?

332
00:32:58,134 --> 00:33:00,865
Would you keep it for me
for a while?

333
00:33:14,357 --> 00:33:16,326
Children. Composition.

334
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:19,854
Djura, hand out the notebooks.

335
00:33:19,899 --> 00:33:21,230
Silence!

336
00:33:20,787 --> 00:33:23,382
That was all I needed!

337
00:33:22,304 --> 00:33:26,140
I could never get more
than a "C"...

338
00:33:26,177 --> 00:33:29,580
and according to my teacher...

339
00:33:29,616 --> 00:33:33,610
I am only good
at scribbling nonsense.

340
00:33:33,654 --> 00:33:35,622
But suddenly a miracle occurred.

341
00:33:35,657 --> 00:33:39,527
"The providence,"
Grandma would say.

342
00:33:39,563 --> 00:33:43,262
The author of the best
composition on the topic...

343
00:33:43,302 --> 00:33:46,864
"Do You Love Comrade Tito
and Why?"...

344
00:33:46,907 --> 00:33:49,376
will represent our school...

345
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:52,279
on the
"March Around Tito's Homeland. "

346
00:33:52,315 --> 00:33:59,520
The winner will be chosen by
a special jury...

347
00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:05,227
composed of our famous writers.

348
00:34:07,666 --> 00:34:09,828
On you go!

349
00:34:20,988 --> 00:34:24,152
Djura, don't copy. I see you.

350
00:34:30,722 --> 00:34:31,985
What's wrong?

351
00:34:32,024 --> 00:34:34,721
Nothing, teacher.

352
00:34:35,863 --> 00:34:37,660
Are you not feeling well?

353
00:34:37,698 --> 00:34:40,601
No, I am concentrating.

354
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:48,878
Come on, finish up.

355
00:34:48,914 --> 00:34:51,042
Five minutes left.

356
00:35:05,038 --> 00:35:07,064
Finished!

357
00:35:21,061 --> 00:35:22,688
Hurry up!

358
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:24,028
Just a stanza.

359
00:35:24,065 --> 00:35:25,829
A stanza?

360
00:35:34,614 --> 00:35:36,110
Time's up.

361
00:35:36,145 --> 00:35:37,607
Finished.

362
00:35:47,868 --> 00:35:50,303
Zoran hasn't touched
his rice pudding.

363
00:35:50,338 --> 00:35:53,741
So what? It won't hurt him
to lose some weight.

364
00:35:59,051 --> 00:36:02,317
Do you want some pancakes?

365
00:38:31,204 --> 00:38:33,935
No!

366
00:38:35,075 --> 00:38:36,543
It's all right now.

367
00:38:38,614 --> 00:38:41,015
Make that paranoid shut up!

368
00:38:41,051 --> 00:38:44,181
What's a paranoid?

369
00:38:44,223 --> 00:38:46,191
It's nothing.
You were having bad dreams.

370
00:38:46,225 --> 00:38:48,194
Go back to sleep.

371
00:38:59,711 --> 00:39:02,409
Dear children...

372
00:39:06,454 --> 00:39:09,948
Today I am happy.

373
00:39:09,793 --> 00:39:12,058
Zoran, come to the blackboard.

374
00:39:15,167 --> 00:39:17,466
Your friend Zoran...

375
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:20,066
our little Zoran...

376
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:24,948
has won the competition
for the best composition...

377
00:39:24,983 --> 00:39:28,350
on the topic
"Do You Love Tito and Why?"...

378
00:39:28,386 --> 00:39:30,947
and he will represent
our school...

379
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:35,429
on the
"March Around Tito's Homeland. "

380
00:39:35,463 --> 00:39:39,196
Moreover, Zoran's
very beautiful poem...

381
00:39:39,235 --> 00:39:45,234
is the best composition
of all the prize winners.

382
00:39:45,278 --> 00:39:48,248
It means that
Zoran has written...

383
00:39:48,282 --> 00:39:52,516
the best composition
in Belgrade.

384
00:39:56,561 --> 00:40:01,159
I'll ask Zoran
kindly to read his poem.

385
00:40:12,217 --> 00:40:15,085
"You ask me do I love Tito?"

386
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,351
Stop.

387
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:20,326
That's not
the way to read a poem.

388
00:40:26,537 --> 00:40:31,203
"You ask me do I love Tito?
It is a superfluous question.

389
00:40:31,244 --> 00:40:35,683
"Everybody adores Tito...
the Chinese and the Spaniards...

390
00:40:35,884 --> 00:40:37,682
"the Indians and the Blacks...

391
00:40:37,887 --> 00:40:40,687
"all the children of our planet.

392
00:40:40,892 --> 00:40:43,259
"The soldiers
only think of Him...

393
00:40:43,295 --> 00:40:46,459
"the shepherd
when he plays his flute...

394
00:40:46,499 --> 00:40:49,469
"the grass sees Him
when it grows...

395
00:40:49,503 --> 00:40:51,989
"the little cows
when they browse...

396
00:40:52,024 --> 00:40:54,475
"the world
thinks highly of Him...

397
00:40:54,511 --> 00:40:59,451
"the swallows only sing for Him.

398
00:40:59,486 --> 00:41:02,421
"And when I feel blue...

399
00:41:02,455 --> 00:41:06,416
"I go to bed late at night...

400
00:41:06,461 --> 00:41:11,230
"and I close my eyes tight...

401
00:41:11,268 --> 00:41:15,730
"If someone asked me
who I love best...

402
00:41:15,942 --> 00:41:20,574
"I'd say I love Tito
more than Mum and Dad. "

403
00:41:21,617 --> 00:41:24,746
Now we are finished for good!

404
00:41:39,576 --> 00:41:42,512
FREUD...
"PSYCHOPATHOLOGY"

405
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:50,223
Turn that light off.

406
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:53,160
I won't be able to get up
in the morning.

407
00:42:00,406 --> 00:42:02,857
I am very worried about Zoran.

408
00:42:02,892 --> 00:42:05,309
Come on, he wrote it for fun.

409
00:42:05,346 --> 00:42:09,546
You know, it can happen
from a very young age.

410
00:42:09,586 --> 00:42:11,817
If we don't intervene now,
it might be too late afterwards.

411
00:42:11,856 --> 00:42:14,121
Are you sleeping?

412
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:27,511
Sea.

413
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,377
Boat.

414
00:42:29,415 --> 00:42:31,316
White.

415
00:42:31,351 --> 00:42:32,477
Black.

416
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:35,354
Good.

417
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:38,360
And now... woman.

418
00:42:39,362 --> 00:42:40,853
Port.

419
00:42:40,898 --> 00:42:42,890
Port?

420
00:42:42,934 --> 00:42:44,300
Is it the first thing
that crosses your mind?

421
00:42:44,337 --> 00:42:45,964
Yes.

422
00:42:50,578 --> 00:42:52,103
Love.

423
00:42:53,516 --> 00:42:55,177
Wait a second.

424
00:42:55,219 --> 00:42:58,917
Answer straightaway. Love.

425
00:42:58,957 --> 00:43:00,448
Orphanage.

426
00:43:02,363 --> 00:43:03,990
Are you sure?

427
00:43:04,031 --> 00:43:05,397
Or Tito's Homeland.

428
00:43:06,569 --> 00:43:09,403
It's either one or the other.
Choose.

429
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:11,965
I don't know. Both.

430
00:43:13,612 --> 00:43:16,173
Have you noticed
that boys write...

431
00:43:16,216 --> 00:43:19,414
the names of their sweethearts
on the walls?

432
00:43:26,063 --> 00:43:29,034
Is there anybody...

433
00:43:29,068 --> 00:43:33,005
you couldn't live without?

434
00:43:38,982 --> 00:43:42,043
If there is such a person...

435
00:43:42,086 --> 00:43:43,645
and if you really love her...

436
00:43:43,689 --> 00:43:46,557
why don't you write her name?

437
00:44:02,683 --> 00:44:05,278
ZORAN LOVES...

438
00:44:06,488 --> 00:44:11,724
...TITO.

439
00:44:29,121 --> 00:44:30,180
Yes!

440
00:44:28,623 --> 00:44:30,489
Stand up.

441
00:44:34,097 --> 00:44:36,464
Move your fringe.

442
00:44:59,865 --> 00:45:01,493
You are from the Orphanage?

443
00:45:02,602 --> 00:45:04,127
You have all the gear?

444
00:45:04,172 --> 00:45:05,366
Yes, Comrade Raja.

445
00:45:05,406 --> 00:45:07,740
Good. Sit down.

446
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:17,079
No need to bray like an ass.

447
00:45:18,792 --> 00:45:20,818
Not an ass, but a kangaroo.

448
00:45:22,331 --> 00:45:23,697
Who said that?

449
00:45:23,733 --> 00:45:27,534
Kangaroo is his nickname.

450
00:45:28,874 --> 00:45:32,402
As from now,
and to the end of the March...

451
00:45:32,446 --> 00:45:36,281
no one is to speak
without authorization.

452
00:45:36,318 --> 00:45:38,286
Understood?

453
00:45:38,321 --> 00:45:41,314
No, no. All together.

454
00:45:41,358 --> 00:45:44,420
- Understood?
- Understood!

455
00:45:52,842 --> 00:45:54,571
It's me.

456
00:45:54,611 --> 00:45:56,580
Is that so?

457
00:45:56,614 --> 00:45:58,207
What are your parents,
chubby cheeks?

458
00:45:58,250 --> 00:46:00,811
They are artists.

459
00:46:02,422 --> 00:46:05,153
One needs artists, too.

460
00:46:05,193 --> 00:46:09,154
Those who are not ready to put
in their biggest efforts...

461
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:10,496
drop out now.

462
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:16,203
Don't go moaning later
like some sis... sis...

463
00:46:16,242 --> 00:46:17,300
Sissy!

464
00:46:17,378 --> 00:46:20,473
Yes, comrade pioneers,
like a sissy!

465
00:46:20,515 --> 00:46:24,647
Because the enemy
is lurking everywhere.

466
00:46:24,688 --> 00:46:27,283
We have to be on the alert.

467
00:46:27,325 --> 00:46:29,794
What will happen
if he infiltrates our ranks?

468
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:33,266
We'd be finished.

469
00:46:33,301 --> 00:46:34,893
Sit down.

470
00:46:36,872 --> 00:46:39,706
There is a song
you have to learn by heart...

471
00:46:39,742 --> 00:46:44,341
since you'll often sing it.

472
00:46:44,383 --> 00:46:45,748
Three, four...

473
00:46:45,785 --> 00:46:53,618
Pretty, pretty is your country

474
00:46:53,663 --> 00:46:57,225
Pretty your country

475
00:46:57,268 --> 00:47:05,277
And the white city
of Zagreb in it

476
00:47:18,299 --> 00:47:25,435
The artists are being late.

477
00:47:25,476 --> 00:47:26,943
Your kid is going away.

478
00:47:26,978 --> 00:47:29,709
What can I do?

479
00:47:29,749 --> 00:47:31,410
Where do you think
you are going?

480
00:47:31,451 --> 00:47:33,788
To find the kid a place.

481
00:47:33,823 --> 00:47:35,415
He's mine now.

482
00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:46,805
Let me introduce Zoran.

483
00:47:50,578 --> 00:47:52,706
There's no room.

484
00:47:52,748 --> 00:47:54,376
All the seats are taken.

485
00:48:00,359 --> 00:48:03,455
Take this thermos!

486
00:48:03,497 --> 00:48:05,557
I can't.

487
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:10,665
Dress warmly!

488
00:48:10,708 --> 00:48:12,973
The letter is stamped.
Just post it.

489
00:48:13,011 --> 00:48:15,446
Don't mess around with girls.

490
00:48:16,516 --> 00:48:17,915
Look at you.

491
00:48:17,951 --> 00:48:20,512
Everything
is going to be just fine.

492
00:48:20,555 --> 00:48:23,651
Don't worry.

493
00:48:23,693 --> 00:48:25,662
Off we go.

494
00:48:44,423 --> 00:48:58,438
The cheese, the butter,
the milk, and the eggs

495
00:48:58,476 --> 00:49:02,938
The milk and the eggs, all goes
to the white city of Zagreb

496
00:49:02,983 --> 00:49:06,421
All goes to
the white city of Zagreb

497
00:49:07,523 --> 00:49:10,118
I'd prefer the white
if you have any.

498
00:49:11,629 --> 00:49:14,759
I have cream puffs.

499
00:49:14,801 --> 00:49:16,860
You like that?

500
00:49:16,903 --> 00:49:19,897
Of course,
it's what I like most.

501
00:49:19,974 --> 00:49:23,035
Even though she was
the only one to be kind to me...

502
00:49:23,078 --> 00:49:28,108
she was incredibly
getting on my nerves.

503
00:49:28,152 --> 00:49:30,748
Hardly begun and you are
already stuffing yourself.

504
00:49:36,965 --> 00:49:38,763
Lights out.

505
00:49:50,051 --> 00:49:52,850
Are you sure
you don't want any cream puffs?

506
00:50:29,842 --> 00:50:31,708
Go on. Get out.

507
00:50:31,745 --> 00:50:33,771
It's not a game for kids.

508
00:50:33,814 --> 00:50:36,716
Do you hear me?

509
00:52:22,705 --> 00:52:25,368
ZAGREB-CENTRAL STATION

510
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:10,848
What the hell
are you doing here?

511
00:53:10,884 --> 00:53:12,352
Out.

512
00:53:12,586 --> 00:53:15,181
After this long
and exhausting trip...

513
00:53:15,223 --> 00:53:17,556
educational above all...

514
00:53:17,593 --> 00:53:21,622
here we are
in the friendly city of Zagreb!

515
00:53:23,034 --> 00:53:25,629
- Guess where I spent the night?
- Stop it, please.

516
00:53:25,672 --> 00:53:27,867
Are you cross with me?

517
00:53:27,909 --> 00:53:31,710
No. I just want
to listen to him.

518
00:53:31,547 --> 00:53:33,516
At this very moment...

519
00:53:33,550 --> 00:53:36,520
now that we have set foot
on this soil...

520
00:53:36,554 --> 00:53:39,542
that wishes us
a hearty welcome...

521
00:53:39,577 --> 00:53:42,529
we can already
smell the perfume...

522
00:53:42,563 --> 00:53:46,968
of Kumrovec, Tito's hometown.

523
00:53:47,002 --> 00:53:50,963
We shall build up an inseparable
friendship with our host.

524
00:53:51,008 --> 00:53:57,041
We would like to thank Zagreb,
the best friend of Belgrade...

525
00:53:57,084 --> 00:54:03,925
for its warm welcome that shall
stay engraved in our hearts...

526
00:54:03,961 --> 00:54:09,458
as an indestructible proof of
friendship between our people.

527
00:54:09,502 --> 00:54:14,134
You deliberately want
to put the shame on us?

528
00:54:17,113 --> 00:54:18,774
Fall in!

529
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:38,109
Comrades pioneers!

530
00:54:38,143 --> 00:54:43,606
This soil has given birth to
the greatest son of our country.

531
00:54:43,651 --> 00:54:46,212
What is this fool talking about?

532
00:54:50,627 --> 00:54:53,723
A man without whom,
we wouldn't be anything.

533
00:54:53,766 --> 00:54:56,065
What a fucking bore!

534
00:54:58,739 --> 00:54:59,934
What?

535
00:55:22,173 --> 00:55:23,539
Over there!

536
00:55:50,648 --> 00:55:54,552
Silence in the ranks!

537
00:56:00,295 --> 00:56:02,925
Stop dawdling!

538
00:56:09,976 --> 00:56:11,808
Hurry up, fatso!

539
00:56:14,316 --> 00:56:20,952
It is the last tram station
in Zagreb...

540
00:56:20,992 --> 00:56:24,952
that Tito's Homeland
was beginning.

541
00:56:24,997 --> 00:56:28,958
In other words, the terrain
to be conquered by foot.

542
00:56:33,743 --> 00:56:36,714
On top of all that,
Comrade Raja announced...

543
00:56:36,748 --> 00:56:39,116
that we won't follow the road...

544
00:56:39,151 --> 00:56:41,950
but the trails of
the comrades partisans...

545
00:56:41,989 --> 00:56:43,787
using natural signs.

546
00:57:01,083 --> 00:57:02,209
Over there!

547
00:57:07,325 --> 00:57:08,452
Over there!

548
00:57:12,466 --> 00:57:16,426
It means that we were to climb
the steepest slopes...

549
00:57:16,471 --> 00:57:19,806
since the comrades partisans...

550
00:57:19,843 --> 00:57:23,713
loved passing
through shitty places.

551
00:57:58,299 --> 00:57:59,927
How come you're here?

552
00:57:59,968 --> 00:58:02,164
- Which way did you go?
- We took the same trail.

553
00:58:02,205 --> 00:58:04,868
They are lying!
They took the road!

554
00:58:05,309 --> 00:58:07,141
Has anyone else seen them?

555
00:58:14,422 --> 00:58:16,220
On your feet!

556
00:58:16,259 --> 00:58:20,254
I had a walking problem
because I was the shortest...

557
00:58:20,298 --> 00:58:24,136
and I definitely
had the biggest bag...

558
00:58:24,171 --> 00:58:28,166
and an itchy rash
had started between my legs.

559
00:58:33,584 --> 00:58:34,916
That's the Medvednica.

560
00:58:36,788 --> 00:58:38,518
We shall spend the night...

561
00:58:38,558 --> 00:58:41,825
at the foot of the mountain,
and we'll climb tomorrow.

562
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:46,799
Comrades pioneers, let's sing!

563
00:59:00,957 --> 00:59:04,292
Then something weird happened.

564
00:59:04,329 --> 00:59:07,891
Just the thought that once
at the foot of the mountain...

565
00:59:07,933 --> 00:59:11,701
we might stop marching
and be allowed to drink water...

566
00:59:11,739 --> 00:59:14,208
gave me new strength...

567
00:59:14,243 --> 00:59:17,874
and made me forget the rash
between my legs.

568
00:59:17,915 --> 00:59:20,976
But the others,
taking it as a challenge...

569
00:59:21,019 --> 00:59:22,749
started racing me.

570
00:59:51,597 --> 00:59:54,624
You didn't think of arriving
before me?

571
00:59:54,668 --> 00:59:56,534
Are you nuts or what?

572
01:00:15,497 --> 01:00:16,863
Comrades pioneers!

573
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:21,066
As of today, we shall all be
choosing the best amongst you...

574
01:00:21,106 --> 01:00:24,804
whom we shall invest with
the privilege to raise the flag.

575
01:00:24,845 --> 01:00:30,046
Today, the person
who has deserved this honor...

576
01:00:30,086 --> 01:00:32,578
by his assiduous work, is...

577
01:00:32,622 --> 01:00:34,989
Sinisa Karahmemetovic!

578
01:00:35,026 --> 01:00:36,756
Please.

579
01:00:36,795 --> 01:00:38,559
Congratulations.

580
01:00:40,701 --> 01:00:42,430
Three, four.

581
01:00:42,270 --> 01:00:50,648
Slavic people, you're the alive
spirit of our grandfathers

582
01:00:50,682 --> 01:00:58,855
While our hearts are filled with
the sacred love of our people

583
01:00:58,894 --> 01:01:06,463
Live, live, Slavic spirit,
you will live forever

584
01:01:06,505 --> 01:01:14,382
Threats of hell
and of destruction are in vain

585
01:01:20,926 --> 01:01:24,021
Sorry, I can't see a thing.

586
01:01:24,231 --> 01:01:29,500
Kangaroo's designation
as hero of the day...

587
01:01:29,538 --> 01:01:34,604
was so unfair
that I didn't sleep a wink...

588
01:01:34,646 --> 01:01:38,778
all that first night
in Tito's Homeland.

589
01:02:34,865 --> 01:02:37,096
Need help?

590
01:02:37,136 --> 01:02:38,865
Mind your own business!

591
01:02:51,357 --> 01:02:52,916
Stop there! Who is it?

592
01:02:52,959 --> 01:02:54,153
It's me.

593
01:02:54,361 --> 01:02:55,693
Password!

594
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:57,581
It's me, Zoran!

595
01:02:57,616 --> 01:02:59,432
And I am the guard!

596
01:02:59,468 --> 01:03:00,731
Piss off!

597
01:03:17,595 --> 01:03:18,892
Come on, let's go!

598
01:03:26,006 --> 01:03:27,406
Get moving!

599
01:03:50,608 --> 01:03:55,673
My rash was getting
more and more painful.

600
01:03:55,715 --> 01:04:00,917
But I didn't know
how to soothe it.

601
01:04:26,260 --> 01:04:28,195
Where are you?

602
01:04:31,668 --> 01:04:34,103
Comrade Raja!

603
01:04:38,879 --> 01:04:40,780
Jasna!

604
01:04:44,953 --> 01:04:49,551
Have another one!

605
01:04:52,598 --> 01:04:56,126
He told you that he was
going to rest a while...

606
01:04:56,169 --> 01:04:58,161
and catch up with us later?

607
01:04:58,206 --> 01:05:00,801
No, he showed it.

608
01:05:00,877 --> 01:05:02,777
How?

609
01:05:02,812 --> 01:05:04,872
Like this!

610
01:05:04,916 --> 01:05:07,044
Didn't he, by any chance, say...

611
01:05:09,622 --> 01:05:11,250
No, like this.

612
01:05:22,141 --> 01:05:23,267
You...

613
01:05:25,813 --> 01:05:27,144
You!

614
01:05:31,754 --> 01:05:33,279
You are volunteers!

615
01:05:35,393 --> 01:05:38,090
You are in charge of the camp!

616
01:05:38,130 --> 01:05:39,689
Is that clear?

617
01:05:39,733 --> 01:05:41,132
Where are we going?

618
01:05:41,168 --> 01:05:44,264
To find him, you idiot!

619
01:08:20,231 --> 01:08:23,532
We've been looking for you
six hours and seventeen minutes.

620
01:08:27,274 --> 01:08:28,537
You'll pay for this!

621
01:11:07,867 --> 01:11:09,665
We shall spend the night here.

622
01:11:09,870 --> 01:11:11,270
In this castle?

623
01:11:11,305 --> 01:11:14,298
Is it not good enough for you?

624
01:11:14,343 --> 01:11:19,180
It is here that
the grand seigneurs lived...

625
01:11:19,216 --> 01:11:21,447
at the expense of poor people.

626
01:11:21,486 --> 01:11:23,352
Do you have some cologne?

627
01:11:23,389 --> 01:11:26,154
Yes, what for?

628
01:11:26,193 --> 01:11:29,460
I've cut myself.
For disinfection.

629
01:11:29,498 --> 01:11:32,059
What about me disinfecting you!

630
01:12:41,669 --> 01:12:43,137
It is a ghost!

631
01:13:04,668 --> 01:13:07,331
The howling came from there!

632
01:13:11,345 --> 01:13:14,805
It smells like perfume.

633
01:13:15,051 --> 01:13:17,486
Perfume? Here?
Don't be ridiculous!

634
01:13:29,671 --> 01:13:31,640
They say there are ghosts...

635
01:13:31,674 --> 01:13:34,109
- Who's "they"?
- I don't know.

636
01:13:34,144 --> 01:13:35,544
You must know!

637
01:13:35,580 --> 01:13:37,173
The children say...

638
01:13:37,249 --> 01:13:38,477
The children?

639
01:13:43,357 --> 01:13:45,383
I'll show them some ghosts!

640
01:15:09,525 --> 01:15:12,927
Let me stay!
I am so scared!

641
01:15:21,798 --> 01:15:25,201
I am the ghost...

642
01:15:25,197 --> 01:15:29,157
My name is Franja!

643
01:15:31,338 --> 01:15:36,335
I died 200 years ago!

644
01:15:45,226 --> 01:15:47,593
It is a ghost!

645
01:15:23,851 --> 01:15:27,151
It's me, Comrade Raja!

646
01:18:10,782 --> 01:18:12,751
Jesus!

647
01:18:22,131 --> 01:18:24,897
What have you done?

648
01:18:24,936 --> 01:18:27,030
It's not me, it's them.

649
01:18:27,073 --> 01:18:28,938
But who?

650
01:18:28,974 --> 01:18:30,806
Them, the ghosts.

651
01:18:37,420 --> 01:18:40,151
Let me explain, it was a game.

652
01:18:40,191 --> 01:18:42,422
To free the children
from their fears.

653
01:18:42,461 --> 01:18:47,834
You have destroyed a collection
of inestimable value!

654
01:18:47,869 --> 01:18:50,202
It's because
of the superstitions.

655
01:18:50,239 --> 01:18:52,765
To cut them short.

656
01:18:55,079 --> 01:18:58,539
Someone is going
to pay for this!

657
01:19:06,262 --> 01:19:08,231
Watch out, fatso!

658
01:19:22,144 --> 01:19:24,613
You know what's happening?

659
01:19:24,648 --> 01:19:28,016
The agents are yelling,
and he keeps replying:

660
01:19:28,052 --> 01:19:32,150
"Yes, I understand, it's my
fault, it won't happen again. "

661
01:19:58,879 --> 01:20:02,681
If there was Law and Order
in this country...

662
01:20:02,885 --> 01:20:06,322
that madman wouldn't be
walking around free!

663
01:20:06,357 --> 01:20:10,659
Shut up, fathead, if you think
of keeping your balls!

664
01:22:08,806 --> 01:22:11,071
Slow down.

665
01:22:11,109 --> 01:22:13,510
I haven't asked you anything!

666
01:22:13,546 --> 01:22:14,949
We are thirsty.

667
01:22:14,984 --> 01:22:16,075
So am I!

668
01:22:16,116 --> 01:22:18,746
Why can't we rest a bit?

669
01:22:18,788 --> 01:22:21,781
Ask the sneak among you!

670
01:22:29,569 --> 01:22:31,731
Who shall I ask?

671
01:22:31,772 --> 01:22:33,764
How would I know?

672
01:22:42,788 --> 01:22:44,950
Traitor, shame on you!

673
01:22:46,261 --> 01:22:48,230
Why? I haven't done anything.

674
01:22:48,264 --> 01:22:49,994
Haven't done anything?

675
01:22:50,033 --> 01:22:52,298
You've denounced Comrade Raja
to that fascist.

676
01:22:52,336 --> 01:22:53,598
What fascist?

677
01:22:53,638 --> 01:22:58,009
You know perfectly well.
The old conservator.

678
01:22:58,044 --> 01:23:00,946
I couldn't know he is a fascist.

679
01:23:00,981 --> 01:23:06,980
The castle is called after him.
Doesn't it ring a bell?

680
01:23:07,024 --> 01:23:11,053
How could I know it was
Comrade Raja under the sheet?

681
01:23:11,096 --> 01:23:14,590
Don't play the innocent with me!

682
01:23:14,635 --> 01:23:18,902
It's finished between us.
I'm breaking up with you.

683
01:24:25,604 --> 01:24:30,134
We have finally reached the last
stop before Tito's Hometown.

684
01:24:30,177 --> 01:24:33,012
Instead of enjoying the delights
of hot water...

685
01:24:33,049 --> 01:24:35,575
a real bed and homemade food...

686
01:24:35,619 --> 01:24:37,485
I couldn't stop thinking...

687
01:24:37,522 --> 01:24:40,924
all that happened to me
was a punishment from God.

688
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:44,864
I was paying for all
my impious words and actions...

689
01:24:44,899 --> 01:24:47,960
for all the coarse words...

690
01:24:48,003 --> 01:24:50,268
I used to say with my friends...

691
01:24:50,306 --> 01:24:53,300
every time we'd seen a priest...

692
01:24:53,512 --> 01:24:58,850
and for the money
I had nicked in the church...

693
01:24:58,886 --> 01:25:01,321
to see the latest "Tarzan"...

694
01:25:01,523 --> 01:25:06,019
the one where Jane
shows her tits.

695
01:25:09,868 --> 01:25:13,897
By punishing me,
God proves He exists...

696
01:25:13,941 --> 01:25:17,275
and that He hasn't
forgotten my sins.

697
01:25:17,312 --> 01:25:21,218
Now He is letting me know
that He would take...

698
01:25:21,253 --> 01:25:23,119
even more rigorous measures.

699
01:25:48,290 --> 01:25:50,851
Then I had a salutary idea.

700
01:26:13,927 --> 01:26:17,092
CHARITY FOR THE CHURCH

701
01:26:20,818 --> 01:26:23,617
The money
Grandma had sewn in my vest...

702
01:26:23,655 --> 01:26:27,319
could replace the stolen packet
from the church.

703
01:26:27,528 --> 01:26:31,124
But would the Catholic God
truly give...

704
01:26:31,165 --> 01:26:34,534
that money back
to our Orthodox God?

705
01:26:47,075 --> 01:26:50,672
After your prayer,
be so kind to come to the hotel.

706
01:27:35,312 --> 01:27:37,372
Let's start.

707
01:27:45,994 --> 01:27:48,759
Comrades pioneers!

708
01:27:48,798 --> 01:27:53,100
Let us hear how some of you
see Tito's Homeland:

709
01:27:55,007 --> 01:27:56,565
"Dear Mum and Dad...

710
01:27:56,609 --> 01:27:59,774
"Grandma and Grandpa,
Auntie and Uncle and so on"...

711
01:28:07,925 --> 01:28:11,158
"Everything would have been
fine, had I not got lost...

712
01:28:11,197 --> 01:28:14,861
"and spent the whole night in
the mountain, all by myself...

713
01:28:14,902 --> 01:28:17,634
"because of the rash
on my buttocks!"

714
01:28:19,461 --> 01:28:23,422
You think it's funny?

715
01:28:23,467 --> 01:28:25,618
It is sad!

716
01:28:25,653 --> 01:28:27,770
Tragic!

717
01:28:27,807 --> 01:28:31,472
These are not the words
worthy of a pioneer of Tito...

718
01:28:31,513 --> 01:28:33,242
but of a spoiled brat!

719
01:28:33,281 --> 01:28:34,681
"My buttocks... "

720
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:40,689
Didn't I say:
"Those who are not ready...

721
01:28:40,726 --> 01:28:43,161
"drop... drop...

722
01:28:43,196 --> 01:28:44,926
"... out!"
Yes, drop out!

723
01:28:44,965 --> 01:28:47,867
But none of you dropped out!

724
01:28:47,903 --> 01:28:50,236
Let's rather talk about...

725
01:28:50,273 --> 01:28:53,641
what our friend Zoran does
during the March.

726
01:28:57,850 --> 01:29:01,689
Had he said:
"I can't, I don't want...

727
01:29:01,724 --> 01:29:03,817
"I don't want," fine!

728
01:29:03,859 --> 01:29:07,319
But him, no!
He is a constant nuisance.

729
01:29:07,364 --> 01:29:08,695
He's sabotaging...

730
01:29:08,732 --> 01:29:09,995
always dragging behind.

731
01:29:10,202 --> 01:29:11,669
In the mountain,
he sleeps in the dry...

732
01:29:11,703 --> 01:29:14,606
whereas you,
you sleep up above...

733
01:29:14,641 --> 01:29:17,202
under a torrential rain!

734
01:29:17,245 --> 01:29:20,876
Because he is the smartest one!

735
01:29:21,918 --> 01:29:24,615
Well, that rash...

736
01:29:24,655 --> 01:29:28,821
Say, it can happen to everybody.

737
01:29:28,861 --> 01:29:30,853
But at the same time...

738
01:29:30,898 --> 01:29:33,891
he reveals an important side
of his personality...

739
01:29:33,935 --> 01:29:38,533
his penchant for sneak...
sneak... ing.

740
01:29:38,575 --> 01:29:39,702
...Ing!

741
01:29:39,744 --> 01:29:41,736
...ing, comrades pioneers.

742
01:29:41,780 --> 01:29:43,578
In his letter...

743
01:29:43,617 --> 01:29:46,917
he is positive that I like
disguising myself as a ghost.

744
01:29:46,954 --> 01:29:50,392
If someone
who doesn't know me...

745
01:29:50,426 --> 01:29:54,956
reads this letter, he'll think
I am a bloody lunatic!

746
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:59,530
To say I like disguising myself!

747
01:30:07,918 --> 01:30:10,547
Let's recap: What is it...

748
01:30:10,589 --> 01:30:13,684
Mr. Zoran is complaining about
in his letter?

749
01:30:13,726 --> 01:30:17,027
He's complaining about me
and his...

750
01:30:17,065 --> 01:30:19,056
Buttocks!

751
01:30:19,302 --> 01:30:23,604
His buttocks, comrades pioneers.

752
01:30:29,983 --> 01:30:33,079
Tell us, where did I find you
this afternoon?

753
01:30:35,625 --> 01:30:37,116
Don't be shy.

754
01:30:38,697 --> 01:30:40,644
In the church.

755
01:30:40,679 --> 01:30:42,593
I didn't hear you.

756
01:30:42,636 --> 01:30:44,628
In the church.

757
01:30:44,672 --> 01:30:46,641
In the church!

758
01:31:21,473 --> 01:31:22,770
It's mine.

759
01:31:22,807 --> 01:31:24,241
I beg your pardon?

760
01:31:24,276 --> 01:31:26,006
It's my grandma's ring.

761
01:31:34,224 --> 01:31:35,749
Here it is!

762
01:31:36,995 --> 01:31:38,792
Let's see.

763
01:31:38,830 --> 01:31:41,926
Why the pioneer Zoran has
offered this precious ring...

764
01:31:41,969 --> 01:31:47,739
that has adorned the hands of
generations of aristocrats...

765
01:31:47,776 --> 01:31:50,007
to the pioneer Jasna?

766
01:31:50,046 --> 01:31:53,142
You don't know?

767
01:31:53,218 --> 01:31:57,554
It's quite obvious!

768
01:32:15,317 --> 01:32:16,579
Well.

769
01:32:16,618 --> 01:32:19,714
The pioneer Zoran
has a disastrous effect...

770
01:32:19,757 --> 01:32:21,851
on the morale of the group!

771
01:32:21,893 --> 01:32:23,861
Consequently he shall be sent...

772
01:32:23,895 --> 01:32:26,695
back to Belgrade
by the first train.

773
01:32:39,086 --> 01:32:40,419
The nearest station...

774
01:32:40,454 --> 01:32:42,923
"what a coincidence"
Grandpa would say...

775
01:32:42,957 --> 01:32:45,222
was situated in Kumrovec,
Tito's Hometown.

776
01:32:45,261 --> 01:32:49,393
We reached it round midday...

777
01:32:49,433 --> 01:32:54,065
our last stop not being far
from the objective of our trip.

778
01:33:01,932 --> 01:33:03,194
Your sandwich.

779
01:33:04,702 --> 01:33:06,102
Your ticket.

780
01:33:51,170 --> 01:33:53,264
Come here.

781
01:33:53,340 --> 01:33:55,605
Get it out from there.

782
01:34:29,392 --> 01:34:31,087
Do you hear me?

783
01:35:17,948 --> 01:35:19,007
Fall in!

784
01:35:25,225 --> 01:35:27,661
What are you waiting for?

785
01:35:30,466 --> 01:35:32,594
Don't drag your feet!

786
01:37:05,036 --> 01:37:07,631
One, two, one, two...

787
01:37:25,966 --> 01:37:27,525
Who's doing the talking?

788
01:37:39,205 --> 01:37:40,639
- You?
- I don't know.

789
01:37:40,674 --> 01:37:42,666
What do you mean,
you don't know?

790
01:37:42,744 --> 01:37:45,339
- You mean my poem?
- Give it to me.

791
01:38:25,105 --> 01:38:28,098
Dear Comrade Tito...

792
01:38:28,103 --> 01:38:31,632
here, in front of Your house,
I owe You an explanation.

793
01:38:31,675 --> 01:38:34,977
There has been
a misunderstanding.

794
01:38:35,012 --> 01:38:38,176
I had the honor
to represent my school...

795
01:38:38,385 --> 01:38:41,913
at this grandiose March.

796
01:38:41,956 --> 01:38:44,517
But I haven't deserved it.

797
01:38:44,559 --> 01:38:49,499
I've done something that
no pioneer of Tito's would do.

798
01:38:49,534 --> 01:38:54,166
In my poem,
I didn't say the truth...

799
01:38:54,207 --> 01:38:57,541
when I wrote that I loved You
more than Mum and Dad.

800
01:38:57,578 --> 01:39:02,040
Everyone knows that I love Mum
and Dad more than anything.

801
01:39:02,085 --> 01:39:04,520
My grandma, too...

802
01:39:04,555 --> 01:39:07,685
all the folks back home...

803
01:39:07,727 --> 01:39:11,129
my uncle and my auntie...

804
01:39:11,165 --> 01:39:14,864
and my cousin Svetlana.

805
01:39:14,904 --> 01:39:17,533
I would particularly
like to point out...

806
01:39:17,574 --> 01:39:19,600
that I prefer my friends
over You...

807
01:39:19,644 --> 01:39:22,580
and a little girl whose name
I won't mention now.

808
01:39:22,614 --> 01:39:23,809
As well as...

809
01:39:23,850 --> 01:39:27,014
Johnny Weissmuller
in the role of Tarzan...

810
01:39:27,054 --> 01:39:28,852
Gary Cooper in all his roles...

811
01:39:28,890 --> 01:39:30,916
the circus of "Adria"...

812
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:33,691
the gypsy who repairs
the casseroles...

813
01:39:33,730 --> 01:39:39,262
and our local loony.

814
01:39:39,473 --> 01:39:44,242
I love everybody around me,
all those You don't know...

815
01:39:44,279 --> 01:39:47,272
and You can't even imagine
how nice they are...

816
01:39:47,484 --> 01:39:49,851
and how much I care about them.

817
01:40:24,825 --> 01:40:26,794
Three days
after we returned home...

818
01:40:26,828 --> 01:40:30,596
a letter arrived for me,
by registered mail.

819
01:40:30,633 --> 01:40:33,262
It's from him for Zoran,
in person.

820
01:40:37,276 --> 01:40:42,807
Impossible! Zoran has nothing
to do with the communists!

821
01:40:42,851 --> 01:40:44,513
Nonsense.

822
01:40:46,289 --> 01:40:48,189
Don't tear it up!

823
01:40:51,597 --> 01:40:52,929
It's mine!

824
01:41:04,816 --> 01:41:05,976
No doubt.

825
01:41:05,217 --> 01:41:09,747
Comrade Tito was addressing
Himself to me personally...

826
01:41:09,790 --> 01:41:13,091
and was inviting me to His place
for His birthday.

827
01:41:22,040 --> 01:41:25,307
Your son is going
to Tito's birthday.

828
01:41:27,215 --> 01:41:31,686
It would be rude
to go empty-handed.

829
01:41:31,721 --> 01:41:36,057
What could we possibly buy him
that he didn't already have?

830
01:41:46,142 --> 01:41:50,581
Zoran will decide by himself
whether he'll go or not.

831
01:42:00,262 --> 01:42:03,756
At the entrance
of the White Palace...

832
01:42:03,801 --> 01:42:07,889
some very pleasant people
searched us from top to bottom.

833
01:42:07,924 --> 01:42:11,977
It is with Kangaroo that they
were the most pleasant...

834
01:42:12,013 --> 01:42:13,777
they stripped him down...

835
01:42:13,816 --> 01:42:15,716
maybe because he doesn't
look like a kid.

836
01:42:19,190 --> 01:42:21,853
In the halls of the Palace...

837
01:42:21,893 --> 01:42:24,294
instead of armors,
there were paintings...

838
01:42:24,330 --> 01:42:27,426
of workmen and partisans,
working their guts out.

839
01:42:57,178 --> 01:42:59,340
You know what's happened
to Comrade Raja?

840
01:43:01,151 --> 01:43:02,311
You don't?

841
01:43:06,958 --> 01:43:08,449
He committed suicide.

842
01:43:09,696 --> 01:43:11,130
Hung himself.

843
01:43:45,220 --> 01:43:52,095
My birthday is not
a national holiday.

844
01:43:52,130 --> 01:43:57,196
It is a day of joy.

845
01:43:57,238 --> 01:43:59,639
Your holiday.

846
01:43:59,675 --> 01:44:01,769
The day of the Youth.

847
01:44:07,987 --> 01:44:10,286
If you'd allow, Comrade Tito.

848
01:44:12,126 --> 01:44:14,687
This is nice, I like this.

849
01:44:21,807 --> 01:44:23,035
Who is this?

850
01:44:24,411 --> 01:44:27,210
It's our teacher, Comrade Raja.

851
01:44:28,282 --> 01:44:30,444
But where is he?

852
01:44:30,654 --> 01:44:33,954
How come the chief
is not with us?

853
01:44:34,992 --> 01:44:36,893
He committed suicide.

854
01:44:47,444 --> 01:44:50,812
What about a few pictures?
