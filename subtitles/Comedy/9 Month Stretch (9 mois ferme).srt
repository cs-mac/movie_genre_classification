<i>If you like stories about chance
and coincidence and fate...</i>

2
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:44,060
<i>then here's one you've never heard.</i>

3
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,000
<i>Boy meets girl...</i>

4
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:53,120
<i>Girl almost kills boy
by running a red light at rush hour.</i>

5
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:57,170
<i>Boy is T-boned at over
60 miles per hour...</i>

6
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:03,370
Oh, my God! Are you all right?

7
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:04,580
Uh..huh.

8
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,960
<i>...and survives with barely a scratch.</i>

9
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,070
Are you drunk?

10
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,130
Not anymore.

11
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,140
Is that cocaine on your nose?

12
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,710
<i>Between the bottle and the sports book,</i>

13
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:21,580
<i>boy had lost his way in
the City of Angels.</i>

14
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:23,880
<i>Until he found one.</i>

15
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,110
<i>The one he's been looking
for his entire life.</i>

16
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,400
I'm sorry, I didn't see the light.

17
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:31,860
Well, don't go towards it now.

18
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:34,780
<i>Boy falls in love in that second,</i>

19
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:38,700
<i>and knows his luck is about to change.</i>

20
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,210
Baby, cum.

21
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,920
Cum, baby, cum on me.

22
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:51,590
<i>What a difference a year makes...</i>

23
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,420
<i>off the bottle and the blow,</i>

24
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,410
<i>high on life itself.</i>

25
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:59,299
<i>And about to put a ring
on this girl's finger.</i>

26
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,339
- That felt good, baby.
- Oh, my God, so good.

27
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:04,060
- Are you happy?
- Yeah, I'm so happy.

28
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:06,300
I'm breaking up with you.

29
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,190
Yeah.

30
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,900
I've met someone, right?

31
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,780
And... and I fell really hard for him
and I didn't expect it to happen,

32
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:15,900
but now that it has, I just feel like
I can't ignore my feelings any longer.

33
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,520
Candice,

34
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,120
I just came.

35
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,200
I know.

36
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,440
I know and so did I.

37
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,750
Are you shitting me?

38
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,740
I wanted you to feel euphoric.

39
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,570
It didn't work!

40
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,470
<i>And after that,</i>

41
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,370
<i>everything pretty much went to shit.</i>

42
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:42,100
<i>What a difference another
fucking year makes.</i>

43
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:46,770
<i>She'd dumped me for the starting
quarterback of the Cleveland Browns.</i>

44
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,860
<i>His signing bonus was 4.5 million,</i>

45
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:53,430
<i>my last check was for 816...</i>

46
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,940
<i>dollars.</i>

47
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:59,930
<i>And I still sit here like an asshole and
wonder if I could've done something different?</i>

48
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,810
<i>She devastated me.</i>

49
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:06,730
<i>She knocked my dick in the dirt.</i>

50
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,690
<i>She took my steam.</i>

51
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,240
<i>My mojo...</i>

52
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:17,530
<i>And I gotta get it back
because this is killing me!</i>

53
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:21,910
<i>I mean, what the fuck am I doing?</i>

54
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,120
Fuck!

55
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,560
<i>I came to LA to be an actor.</i>

56
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:29,409
Uh, hi, I'm Kevin Briyzowski.

57
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,809
<i>Next.</i>

58
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,079
What's up, I'm Kevin Brizow.

59
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,110
<i>Next.</i>

60
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,550
I'm Kai Bravo.

61
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,979
<i>And now, I drive a limo.</i>

62
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:42,040
<i>And, shocker, I hate it.</i>

63
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,400
<i>I hate the hours...</i>

64
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:47,149
<i>I hate the clients...</i>

65
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:50,660
<i>And, fuck me, I hate my life.</i>

66
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:54,219
<i>I gotta get my shit together.</i>

67
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,620
<i>I know I do.</i>

68
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:03,150
<i>My life is nearly half over and I have
exactly jack shit to show for it.</i>

69
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,760
<i>No money...</i>

70
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,589
<i>No power...</i>

71
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,839
<i>and no women.</i>

72
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:16,610
<i>And in this town, I am fucking positive
that's the order they come in.</i>

73
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,499
<i>Better men would've blown
their heads off by now.</i>

74
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,389
<i>Men like Karl with a "K".</i>

75
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,589
Hi, I'm Karl...

76
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,039
<i>That's how he introduced himself.</i>

77
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,679
...with a "K".

78
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,760
<i>Karl with a "K" was legendary.</i>

79
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,590
<i>Karl with a "K" lived to serve.</i>

80
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:39,660
<i>Karl with a "K"
was the industry gold standard.</i>

81
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,689
<i>Do you like dry two olive
Bombay martinis with a shot of Chambord?</i>

82
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:46,689
<i>Karl with a "K" knows you do.</i>

83
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:47,939
- Loose.
- Yeah.

84
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,299
- See that?
- Okay. Okay.

85
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,469
- Just, no tension.
- I see it now.

86
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,429
- Costa Rica...
- Aruba.

87
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:57,319
<i>Karl with a "K" was trim,
worldly and well-traveled.</i>

88
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,809
You know, I actually did
an Ironman Triathlon in Panama.

89
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:01,549
Wow.

90
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:02,589
<i>To Karl with a "K"...</i>

91
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:04,719
All right, Norman, I think I got
everything out of the bathroom.

92
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,879
<i>...it was about the client.</i>

93
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,159
Quick question. Is that a severed penis?

94
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,269
<i>Always about the client.</i>

95
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,079
Yes, sir.

96
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,729
Some chilled Veuve Clicquot
for the returning honeymooners.

97
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:15,829
Thank you.

98
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:21,049
<i>Karl with a "K" was quite simply the
personification of total client satisfaction.</i>

99
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,029
- What about her?
- She's dead.

100
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,729
But, uh, I got you a blueberry muffin.
It's on the seat.

101
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:28,150
Oh! You're the greatest, Karl.

102
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:35,059
<i>I am sure his sterling reputation
thrilled Karl with a "K" to no end...</i>

103
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,690
Wow.

104
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:41,210
You guys look so happy.

105
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,529
<i>...right up until the day he
sucked on a .38 snub nose.</i>

106
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:53,419
<i>It would mark the only time in nearly 20 years
that someone else would clean his limo.</i>

107
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:56,839
<i>Jesus, they buried him in one of those.</i>

108
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,559
<i>I heard later that Karl
had come to LA to be an actor.</i>

109
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,259
<i>But I cannot go out like that.</i>

110
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,579
<i>I don't even believe in fate,</i>

111
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,829
<i>only in the destiny that
you make for yourself.</i>

112
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:13,749
<i>The only reason I am in this hole
is because I couldn't stop digging.</i>

113
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,900
<i>But that has to change.</i>

114
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:19,419
<i>Starting today, this fucking minute,</i>

115
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:23,390
<i>I am putting the goddamn shovel down.</i>

116
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,069
Yes, indeed.

117
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,109
What's up, babe? What's with these guys?

118
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:56,219
Naseem wants you front and center, homie.

119
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,319
He taking heads?

120
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,500
Not yet, but whatever fears you have
are totally founded.

121
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,139
Oh, no.

122
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,159
- Oh, come on.
- What?

123
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,289
- Jesus.
- What? What are you doing?

124
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:11,239
Look at you.

125
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,919
- You're a disaster.
- Okay.

126
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,349
I can't...

127
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,189
Who gains weight in their neck?

128
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,489
Sexy people.

129
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:20,590
Smart-ass.

130
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,989
You look like a slob.

131
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:25,069
And you look like desert camo.

132
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,459
That's what I'm going for.

133
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,669
Wait, you just disappeared in that chair.
I can only see your head.

134
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:29,769
You're funny.

135
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:30,889
You think I'm gonna get axed?

136
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:33,749
Since you seem
to actively want to lose this job?

137
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,929
- Yeah.
- I don't know, maybe...

138
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:37,129
Maybe losing my job is like...
Is like part of some plan.

139
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,869
Wait. This is coming from
the guy who doesn't even want

140
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:42,729
to acknowledge that shit
actually happens for a reason.

141
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,459
You're talking about fate,
I don't believe in that.

142
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,779
And yet, you're a fatalist.

143
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,189
Not even close.

144
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:49,049
I'm sorry. Sorry, it was easy.

145
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,739
- Easy.
- You really think so?

146
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,220
Yes, indeed.

147
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,089
- Hi.
- Hi.

148
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:57,070
- Hey.
- Hey.

149
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:01,020
Someone is calling you.

150
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,969
- Again?
- Get out of here.

151
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:04,159
Go get yourself fired.

152
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,540
Shit.

153
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:14,029
Are you firing me, Naseem?

154
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:16,039
You have a past, eh, Stretch?

155
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,899
Lots of drugs, alcohol, gambling.
You were addicted, yes?

156
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,189
I was addicted, yes. Severely.

157
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:26,890
Uh, but I haven't placed a bet, uh, taken
a drink or done a drug in over a year.

158
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,929
Oh, right.

159
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:31,039
Do you believe you owe something?

160
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,429
Uh, to the people I gambled against?

161
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:36,969
Uh, yes. About $6,000 to be exact.

162
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:38,499
$6,000?

163
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,629
Well, it was 12, so I cut it in half.

164
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,919
Do you believe that you owe me something?

165
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,239
Well, you have given me
a ton of breaks, so...

166
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,719
'Cause I need the old you now.

167
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,920
The part of you powered by pure need, hmm?

168
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,519
These other companies
like this cockfuckers

169
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,640
Cossack trying to steal our clients.

170
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:04,389
So I need every driver to work
as hard as they've ever worked,

171
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:09,129
for if these Cossack sons of whores
take over, I'm out of business.

172
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:10,819
And you are out of luck.

173
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,649
This is do,

174
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:15,220
or this is die.

175
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,550
Yes, indeed.

176
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,869
<i>Yes, indeed.</i>

177
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:20,969
<i>It's funny.</i>

178
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:22,159
<i>I would've bet anything</i>

179
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,219
<i>that Naseem was gonna cap my ass
this morning and send me packing.</i>

180
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:30,080
<i>Huh, I guess things are
looking up already.</i>

181
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,189
Hey.

182
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:35,549
Oh, shit.

183
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,889
Whoo!

184
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:39,389
- Look at this motherfucker.
- Iggy.

185
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,849
I know you've been getting my calls.
You're fuckin' ignoring 'em.

186
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,319
I don't know what you're talking about.

187
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,099
Before you say anything else, you need to
know that I'm totally powerless against this.

188
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,469
- Okay, this is not good.
- This is not good at all.

189
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:52,239
Carlos has sold the farm.
It's new ownership.

190
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,699
No books. So, the six grand you owe...

191
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,530
I'm gonna need it by midnight tonight.

192
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:02,429
- Fuck me!
- Exactly.

193
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:04,859
- You're serious?
- I'm colon cancer.

194
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,529
I pay every month on time!

195
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,249
- I know.
- Well, do they know?

196
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,829
They do and they don't give a shit!

197
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:14,809
I got a better shot at shitting out
a full grown female giraffe

198
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:18,019
than coming up with six grand
by midnight tonight!

199
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:21,220
- Can I talk to the new owners?
- Can you speak Cantonese?

200
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:25,479
- All right, so if I can't get the cash?
- What do you think, Kevin?

201
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,259
I've been chasing you all around town.

202
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,079
When you call me Kevin
I really start to flip out.

203
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,559
Yeah, you should get freaked out,

204
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,189
because I'm gonna have
to leave a lot more than bruises behind.

205
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:35,690
Don't make me come looking for you.

206
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:39,649
<i>Uh, babe, I'm sorry
but I'm running really fucking late.</i>

207
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:41,399
<i>Tell me
you're messing with me, dude.</i>

208
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,989
<i>Uh, I got hung up with an old friend.</i>

209
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:46,979
<i>What is wrong with you?
This is a first run of the day.</i>

210
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,189
<i>- Charlie...
- First one!</i>

211
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:51,810
<i>Charlie, relax. I'll handle it.
Now, who am I pickin' up?</i>

212
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:12,939
Has anyone ever referred to you
as a punk-ass motherfucker?

213
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:15,679
Uh, not to my recollection.

214
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,700
You're a punk-ass motherfucker.

215
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:22,709
Who's an hour late.

216
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,329
Um, I'm really sorry.

217
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:25,869
Come on, son.

218
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:29,029
If you're gonna patronize me,
at least put your fucking back into it.

219
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:31,529
You don't have any respect for the Hoff.

220
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,860
Am I right?

221
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,419
You think I never held a knife?

222
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:40,949
That I'm unfamiliar with
the taste of blood?

223
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:45,149
That I took a shitty, sub-par show
about lifeguards,

224
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:49,009
and turned it into the highest-rated
syndicated hit in television history

225
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:52,370
because I got fuckin' lucky?

226
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:59,729
I once forcibly sodomized
a Viet Cong colonel with a stick grenade

227
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:04,579
because he placed an ancestral curse
on me while I was interrogating him.

228
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:08,119
And I don't even believe
in ancestral curses,

229
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:12,660
but that's how fucking deep I roll.

230
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:24,649
<i>If Karl with a "K" represented
the light of the limo industry,</i>

231
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:28,849
<i>then its black hole, its darkest dungeon</i>

232
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:33,939
<i>came in the form of a nameless,
ageless Eastern European immigrant</i>

233
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:37,559
<i>known simply as, "The Jovi".</i>

234
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,069
<i>He lorded over his company Cossack</i>

235
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:43,779
<i>with an iron fist
and a white-maned hair metal band wig</i>

236
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:48,280
<i>that looked like Dog the Bounty Hunter
had been dropped into a deep fryer.</i>

237
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:51,299
<i>I don't care how it sounds.</i>

238
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,009
<i>That hair scared the living shit
out of me.</i>

239
00:12:54,010 --> 00:13:00,249
<i>This blow-dried, death shroud that encased
The Jovi in permanent, perpetual shadow</i>

240
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,010
<i>made him seem indestructible.</i>

241
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,330
Fuck!

242
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:47,379
What the fuck, dude? Naseem's going nuts!

243
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,079
What happened to Hasselhoff?

244
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,599
<i>The Jovi got him?</i>

245
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,749
<i>Did you not get Naseem's speech
to the troops today?</i>

246
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:53,759
I did, I did.

247
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,829
This is the fifth client we've lost
to The Jovi in the last month.

248
00:13:56,830 --> 00:14:00,409
<i>He picked off Andy Cohen last week
and he got Seacrest yesterday.</i>

249
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:02,299
Flew him to Vegas personally.

250
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,059
What? Jovi's a fucking pilot?

251
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:06,359
<i>Naseem thinks he's monitoring
our dispatch calls.</i>

252
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,959
I mean, I... I don't know.

253
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,899
Oh, is that why those guys
were in the office today?

254
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,779
<i>Yep.</i>

255
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:13,299
<i>They wired us up
so we can eavesdrop on The Jovi.</i>

256
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,939
So we're stealing his clients too?

257
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,099
Tit for tat.

258
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,429
I want in. Jovi jacked Hasselhoff,

259
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:22,299
<i>and I want to steal
The Jovi's next client, whoever it is.</i>

260
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:25,620
<i>And not to mention, babe,
but I need the cash, badly.</i>

261
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,679
I'm way too good to you.

262
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,559
<i>I'll keep my eye out for a big fish
and let Naseem know.</i>

263
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,729
It might buy you a stay of execution.

264
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:34,819
<i>- I'll call you back.</i>
- Yes, indeed.

265
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,469
Here you go.

266
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:38,249
Here it is.

267
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,859
That is called "take-charge shit", son!

268
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,919
That is called "take-charge shit", son!

269
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,809
"Yes, indeed. Yes, indeed."

270
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:46,329
"Hi, my name is Stretch,"

271
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:50,040
"aka Billy Big Balls With Bad Ideas."

272
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,759
<i>Karl would appear to me occasionally</i>

273
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,129
<i>when I was exhausted or otherwise beat.</i>

274
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:58,049
- I thought you hated this job?
- Doesn't mean I can afford to lose it.

275
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:00,909
<i>Wearing a mustache
that he said he grew in hell.</i>

276
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,419
Just drink.

277
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:05,609
You're so boring. Do some blow.

278
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,909
- Anything...
- I need you to leave me alone.

279
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:10,789
I'm not here, dicksmoke! I'm a figment.

280
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:13,439
<i>I'm your fragile, fagotty mind!</i>

281
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,599
Fracturing from lack of sleep,
anxiety, weakness...

282
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,130
Failure.

283
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,929
<i>I knew it was in my head, but lately,
he was showing up more and more.</i>

284
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:31,910
You know, right before I blew my head off,
I rolled the gun barrel in powdered sugar.

285
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:35,579
It was between that and cake batter.
Which way are you leaning?

286
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,919
I couldn't kill myself.

287
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,390
You are killing yourself, fuckwit!

288
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:48,579
<i>All right, so that was just dumb luck.</i>

289
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:51,889
<i>Iggy tracking me down,
making me late for Hasselhoff.</i>

290
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:53,909
<i>I gotta stay positive.</i>

291
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:56,570
<i>I'm pretty sure karma owes me one now.</i>

292
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:04,300
<i>Fuck me!</i>

293
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:15,650
No, no, no.

294
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:21,379
You fucker!

295
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,280
You fucker! You fucker!

296
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,200
<i>Holy shit!</i>

297
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,669
<i>Yes, indeed.</i>

298
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:35,259
Yo, we got an ASAP in Cossack.
You still wanna steal Jovi's clients?

299
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,969
<i>Babe, I just saw a gun fight.</i>

300
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:39,259
- My ears are still ringing.
<i>- Was it in the Valley?</i>

301
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,899
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Shocker.

302
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,169
<i>- Are you all right?</i>
- Oh yeah, I'm good. Woke me up.

303
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,879
Limo, not so much. Took a little damage.

304
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,059
What kind of damage?

305
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:48,239
Uh, bullets of the bullethole variety.

306
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,969
You're fucking with me. Really?

307
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:52,519
Yeah, whatever. Who cares?
Gives it a little character.

308
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,379
So, are we gonna boost
The Jovi's client list or what?

309
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:58,629
Yup. Ray Liotta, Sony in Culver City
going to Santa Monica Airport.

310
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:02,009
And Liotta's a personal client, bitches!

311
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:04,109
All right, fuck The Jovi
and his horrible head of hair.

312
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,500
Oh, sick!

313
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,579
You love it.

314
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:10,420
<i>- I owe you, babe.</i>
- All right, I'm hanging up.

315
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:03,449
We'll need you back at 7 a.m.

316
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:06,809
No! No, no, no, no, no.
Just push the call!

317
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:08,669
<i>I'm not gonna land and go straight to set.</i>

318
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,379
<i>It's stupid. Come on, Monica.</i>

319
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,299
- That's not my name.
- Marcy! I knew that.

320
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,549
I knew that.

321
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,259
Why are you so angry all the time?

322
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,140
- You always seem so angry. What's wrong?
- You want me to tell you?

323
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,760
- Is it me?
- No.

324
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,169
Oh, well then I don't give a shit.

325
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,929
- Mr. Liotta.
- I'm just being honest.

326
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:27,949
Hi, I'm Kevin. I'm your driver.
Can I take your bags?

327
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:30,209
Wait, wait, wait. Where's what's-his-name?
My guy? That Jovi?

328
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,899
Well, he couldn't make it today, sir.

329
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:35,149
Uh, he's traveling with another client.
My car's right down there.

330
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:36,799
What, do you work for him?

331
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,559
I work for a rival company, sir.

332
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,349
My company called when
he couldn't make the pick-up personally.

333
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:43,589
He's driving David Hasselhoff right now.

334
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,969
Who?

335
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:47,799
From TV? Baywatch?

336
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,429
Knight Rider?

337
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:52,899
Remember back in the '80s?
That, uh... that car that talked?

338
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,619
No, I don't remember a
fucking car that talked.

339
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,999
Car that talked.

340
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,519
What movies has he been in?

341
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,679
Uh, well, not one that I
can think of offhand.

342
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,289
Wait a second,
I'm getting tossed for a TV actor

343
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:06,729
who hasn't been in one movie
that you can remember?

344
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,679
Honestly, sir, it, uh...

345
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:12,480
It's really shocking to me
that you're being treated this way.

346
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,350
You're not an actor, are you?

347
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:19,049
- Actually...
- 'Cause that last line...

348
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:22,519
About being really shocked,
I didn't buy it for a second.

349
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,380
Not a second.

350
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:30,049
That's all we need is another
wannabe Denzel driving a fucking limo.

351
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:31,779
Come on, come on, come on,
it's hot, it's hot, it's hot.

352
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,539
Watch your legs.

353
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,030
Dick.

354
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:38,439
<i>Fucking unbelievable!</i>

355
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,009
<i>What? What? What, Marcy?</i>

356
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:44,999
<i>You've been fucking calling me
since I left the fucking set!</i>

357
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,659
<i>What could be so fucking important?</i>

358
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,260
What?

359
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,179
What?

360
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:55,410
Fuck me! Gosh, damn it!

361
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,499
All right, you know what?
I'm gonna give it to the driver,

362
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,449
he'll get it back, okay? I'm sorry.

363
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:00,879
Sorry.

364
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,469
- Everything all right?
- Will you do me a favor?

365
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,249
- Take this back to Sony.
- Mmm.

366
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:08,099
Give it to that little dyke Marcy
with the red hair, okay?

367
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,679
Can you do that for me?

368
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,979
Look, there's blanks in that gun
so don't be an asshole.

369
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,209
Absolutely.

370
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:15,939
- I'll have it to them within the hour.
- Thanks.

371
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:18,140
Wow. That's very kind of you.

372
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,830
Hey.

373
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:22,349
And that Jovi...

374
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:26,290
You made yourself a new enemy today.
Be careful.

375
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,999
<i>Yeah, well, The Jovi's just
going to have to take a number.</i>

376
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,649
<i>Right now I'm a bit preoccupied with the
six large I need to come up with for Iggy.</i>

377
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:38,189
<i>Liotta's $200 tip, while generous,
isn't going to save me</i>

378
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:40,980
<i>from a pair of shattered kneecaps.</i>

379
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,880
<i>I know what you thinking.</i>

380
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,839
<i>It's stupid of me to be lavishing
attention on my love life</i>

381
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,599
<i>the same day that a very agitated
member of the Mexican mafia</i>

382
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,999
<i>has promised to break things
I don't want broken.</i>

383
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,799
<i>And there's always the chance that
this "Pinkminx" isn't actually a woman,</i>

384
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,650
<i>there was just something about the...</i>

385
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,490
Pink. Huh.

386
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:33,789
<i>Well, if that's stupid,
then this is just plain old reckless.</i>

387
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:37,580
<i>The one addiction
I haven't been able to shake.</i>

388
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,229
<i>Her.</i>

389
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:41,229
<i>Let's not call it stalking.</i>

390
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:45,579
<i>I know I'm not getting her back,
there was just never any closure.</i>

391
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:49,809
<i>On some cellular level
that still torments me.</i>

392
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:52,819
Could you be a bigger chump right now?

393
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:55,410
Not really, no.

394
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:01,189
"She left me, the loser limo driver,"

395
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:04,019
"for a millionaire athlete."

396
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:07,070
"And I never saw it coming."

397
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:11,880
<i>Seriously, pal, did that shocker
really sneak up on you?</i>

398
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:15,730
Yeah, it did.

399
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,809
Yes, indeed.

400
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:23,539
I got you a booking.

401
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:26,419
<i>- The great white whale has surfaced...</i>
- Oh.

402
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,659
...and his name is Roger Karos.

403
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,999
<i>Heard of him?</i>

404
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,809
- If he's cash rich, I don't care.
- Huge.

405
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:33,859
Billionaire.

406
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:37,839
He used to be Karl's regular
and he sorta still thinks Karl's alive.

407
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,839
Uh, come on. I can be Karl.

408
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,899
From what I heard, this dude's
pretty nuts,

409
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:47,589
but I've also heard of him tipping
thousands just for an airport run, so...

410
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:50,109
- All right, where?
<i>- I've got coordinates.</i>

411
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,799
You... you got what?

412
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,669
Coordinates. GPS.

413
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:56,679
<i>He doesn't want to disclose the location,
I don't know what that means.</i>

414
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,329
Oh, and he wants to be met
with a weird list of goodies.

415
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:01,529
You have to get that
before you go and pick him up.

416
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:03,440
<i>I'll text it to you.</i>

417
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,669
Oh, God damn it!

418
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:07,849
I forgot, I gotta take
this stuff over to Sony for Liotta.

419
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:10,749
You do that and this booking goes poof.

420
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,089
<i>- Come on.</i>
- All right, all right, all right.

421
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:13,890
I'll figure something out.

422
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:19,099
<i>Charlie comes through in the clutch,</i>

423
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,800
<i>a crazy billionaire who
can paint my pockets.</i>

424
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:25,290
<i>The only thing missing now
is the crazy billionaire.</i>

425
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:28,669
<i>These are the coordinates,
X marks the spot.</i>

426
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:31,260
<i>I'm here. Where is this guy?</i>

427
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,420
Shit!

428
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:44,790
What the fuck?

429
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:50,980
Oh, shit!

430
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:08,150
Uh...

431
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,420
Mr. Karos?

432
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:58,239
Oh, you're not Karl.

433
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,749
- I'm Kevin.
- Who the fuck is Kevin?

434
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,719
That's me, uh, Stretch, if you'd prefer.

435
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,229
What I prefer is Karl.

436
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:08,649
Okay. Um, Karl...

437
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:11,589
Uh, passed away

438
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:14,010
a little while ago.

439
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:18,920
So I'm here.

440
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:28,540
- Those are the things I asked for?
- Yeah.

441
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:32,689
- Scotch?
- Mmm..hmm.

442
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:35,330
- Caulking gun?
- Mmm..hmm.

443
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,350
- Butt plugs, plural?
- Mmm..hmm.

444
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:47,070
What'd he die of? Karl?

445
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:51,400
He took his own life, unfortunately.

446
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,489
Fuck him.

447
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:06,379
I need a driver and a confidant,
a bagman and a protector.

448
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:09,300
- I'm in.
- Walk with me.

449
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,489
You got any religious hang-ups?
You a godhead?

450
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:17,250
Uh, nope.

451
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:22,539
Uh, tomorrow I will be a brand new face
in a brand new place,

452
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:26,200
so I've got a marathon in mind.

453
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:29,099
First stop,

454
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,859
my tailor Enzo.

455
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:34,199
That suit looks like death taking a shit.

456
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,239
How far is Beverly Hills?

457
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,620
Uh, 45 minutes, depending on which...

458
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:51,239
<i>Okay,
so this Karos is a total freak show.</i>

459
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,269
<i>So what? It's Hollywood.</i>

460
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:58,090
<i>A town that specializes
in the sick and deranged.</i>

461
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:03,309
<i>As long as he's got the cash,</i>

462
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:06,739
<i>I can take all the weird... holy shit!</i>

463
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:10,760
<i>Boris. The Jovi's brother
and head henchman.</i>

464
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:14,729
<i>I once saw him body slam
a 300-pound bouncer</i>

465
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:18,110
<i>onto the hood of a VW Cabriolet.</i>

466
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:21,499
<i>He had plates in his head.</i>

467
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,079
Hello, buddy.

468
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:26,130
<i>He had murdered men with his hands.</i>

469
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,629
<i>He knows about Liotta.</i>

470
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:30,589
<i>He knows what I did.</i>

471
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:32,500
Fuck it.

472
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,939
Yes, indeed.

473
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:46,309
What's wrong? You sound weird, is it him?

474
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:48,459
He skydived in, naked.

475
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,699
No way, completely naked?

476
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,119
Mmm..hmm, bare-assed,
except for a pair of sneakers

477
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,379
and about 60 pounds of Rick Rubin's beard.

478
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,179
<i>If you're feelin' funky about it,</i>

479
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,699
we'll just lay him off on The Jovi.
It's not worth it.

480
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:03,769
No, I can't explain it.
I mean, as oddball as he is,

481
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:06,309
<i>I get the sense that, like,
my meeting him is a...</i>

482
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,559
If you say fated...

483
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,129
Let me finish. Not fated, lucky.

484
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:13,869
- Luck, fate, I mean, it's semantics.
- Do me a favor.

485
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:15,819
Go online, get me a bio, all right?

486
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:18,259
I got a feeling this guy's about
to skip town for good

487
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:21,180
and bleed a boatload of
cash on his way out.

488
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,969
<i>- It's a big gamble.</i>
- From a former gambler.

489
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:26,599
I know odds. He's sitting on my $6,000.

490
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,240
- Long shot.
- Sure thing.

491
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:31,409
I'm going on the Internet now.

492
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,260
All right. Call me back.

493
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,480
<i>No, I've got a vehicle, I'll ring you
with the time and a place later.</i>

494
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,160
<i>Later.</i>

495
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:17,849
<i>What kind of man are you, Stretch?</i>

496
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:22,729
<i>Are you one of those Habitat-for-Humanity,
eco-friendly, all-veggie douchebags</i>

497
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:26,019
<i>devoted to crippled kids and the elderly?</i>

498
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:30,429
Or are you a money, power, pussy,

499
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:33,050
Holy Trinity type?

500
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:34,779
I don't know. Haven't really...

501
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:40,449
You see, me, I am about
simple, succinct pleasures.

502
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:43,919
Cocaine is my first
and longest-standing love,

503
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:50,179
but I would be equally lost
without good Scotch whiskey...

504
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:53,860
and sadomasochism.

505
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:57,199
I want you to try something
when you have a free moment.

506
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,769
You just make a fist,

507
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:02,869
and hit yourself in the face
as hard as you can.

508
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:06,529
I swear to God,
you will find it so fucking freeing.

509
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:09,229
It is like...

510
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:12,000
It is like stepping off a cliff.

511
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,509
Holy shit!

512
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:21,509
- There it is.
- You okay back there?

513
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:24,889
That metallic taste, it's tremendous!

514
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:27,110
It's living!

515
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,879
Hey, can I ask you, what do you...

516
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:33,350
What do you get out
of punching yourself in the face?

517
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,350
Clarity.

518
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:47,790
The comfort in knowing
I can take that punch.

519
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:53,169
What do you make weekly,
this line of work?

520
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:56,489
Don't know, depends. 25-30 an hour.

521
00:30:56,490 --> 00:31:00,110
- Plus tips.
- Take home, total?

522
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,570
Not enough.

523
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:06,459
- To get by.
- No.

524
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:09,819
Or to pay down $6,000 in gambling debt...

525
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:12,650
that you just found out
was due in full.

526
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:19,409
You're a gambler?

527
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:22,249
I have a, uh... I had...

528
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:24,619
A gambling addiction.

529
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:29,930
That just means
you lost a lot more than you won.

530
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,759
And if you don't pay, what happens then?

531
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,069
Broken bones? Bullet in the head?

532
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:38,170
That, uh, that could be a coin toss.

533
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:47,740
Are you a fire starter, Stretch?

534
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:51,299
Am I what?

535
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:57,070
Oh, it takes almost no imagination,
sounds exactly like what it is.

536
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,160
Are you a fire starter?

537
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,329
Yeah, sure. Yeah, I guess.

538
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:05,069
No, say it in stride.

539
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:09,190
"I am a fire starter."

540
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:13,060
I am a fire starter.

541
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,060
Good.

542
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:18,850
So am I.

543
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,619
Now, we're on fire!

544
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,510
Holy shit!

545
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,350
Jesus Christ.

546
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:50,960
Goddamn! What is wrong with you?

547
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:54,010
God damn it.

548
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:58,230
Fine.

549
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:09,100
Did you say firefighter?

550
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:22,580
Do my bidding tonight,
Stretch, and maybe...

551
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:29,689
Maybe I'd dig down deep
and make that $6,000 worth of headache...

552
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:32,660
disappear.

553
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:45,720
You game?

554
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:49,040
Yes, indeed.

555
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:01,180
Thank you.

556
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:04,149
So, where we headed tonight?

557
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:06,689
Have you heard of the Midnight Shadow?

558
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:08,909
- Social club.
- I have heard.

559
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:10,910
What have you heard?

560
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,689
Gentlemen, I have everything I need.

561
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:16,269
Uh, give me 10 minutes.

562
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:18,069
- Eight minutes, Enzo.
- You want my coat?

563
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,649
No, no, no. Ciao, ciao.

564
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:23,069
- No, no. No, no. No, no.
- Ciao, ciao. Ciao, ciao. Choo-choo train.

565
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:25,359
Um, in a nutshell, um...

566
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:29,109
You can pay to see a coked-out
snow leopard sexually assaulted
in one room

567
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:32,409
and, uh, participate
in an all-amputee-orgy in the next?

568
00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:35,869
Oh, drugs, sexual
depravity, animal cruelty.

569
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:38,659
I mean to me that's just
a slow night, but...

570
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,639
That's very good!

571
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:43,870
That's very quick, Stretch. I like that.

572
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,820
I like so very few people.

573
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:54,470
I'm wondering how
you endeared yourself to me so fast.

574
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:59,830
I think fate brought us together.

575
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:04,289
I don't believe in fate, destiny...

576
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:07,599
To me life's nothing but timing.

577
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,979
I like that!

578
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:12,059
Life is nothing but timing.

579
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,690
Yeah.

580
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,620
I'm going to steal that one.

581
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,220
Okay.

582
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:27,810
Uh...

583
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:30,129
You okay?

584
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:32,420
Mr. Karos?

585
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:36,059
I think I just fell asleep.

586
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,889
I think so, too.

587
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:39,709
That's very soft, by the way.

588
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:41,949
- You bought it.
- Is that alpaca?

589
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:43,950
I don't think so.

590
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:51,239
You look sharp.

591
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:54,750
Sit tight. Have some company joining us.

592
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:04,170
Finally.

593
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,689
- Yo.
- Hey, talk to me.

594
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:09,459
<i>I have someone named Marcy from Sony</i>

595
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:12,069
on the line who's in complete hysterics.

596
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:14,709
Oh, shit, yes.
That's the stuff I was telling you about.

597
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:16,729
The prop gun that Liotta
wanted me to return.

598
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:20,989
She said that she and the prop master
can't leave set because you, my friend,

599
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:24,059
have a registered firearm
that could be used to commit a crime.

600
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:26,169
Well, tell her forget it.
It's not gonna happen.

601
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:28,699
I got a client. Speaking of which,
did you find out anything?

602
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:32,339
First of all, I just want to say
I'm sorry from the bottom of my heart

603
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:35,809
<i>he's about to be indicted
on major money laundering.</i>

604
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:37,169
- What?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

605
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:39,409
I mean, these investment pyramid schemes,

606
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:42,349
<i>some shady Nigerian holding company
he was involved with...</i>

607
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:44,019
<i>Wait, where are you seeing this stuff?</i>

608
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,559
On the LA Times website.

609
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,049
Well, what am I supposed to do about it?

610
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:48,309
Kick him the fuck out!

611
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:50,870
Kick him out... I can't kick him out.

612
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:54,120
Here they are.

613
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:56,909
I'm shameless in that I pay for pussy,

614
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:59,419
but this is

615
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,659
world class.

616
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:07,560
This is a level of appreciation one
reserves for great art, or fine wine or...

617
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:10,530
Ah, whatever.

618
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,540
Oh...

619
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:27,589
The one in the middle there,

620
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:30,179
the things she can do
with her mouth and throat,

621
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:34,460
will have you thinking one
of her ancestors fucked a python
at some point.

622
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:37,600
Yep.

623
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,999
Wow.

624
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,830
Benedict Canyon, 10,000 block, entry fee.

625
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:04,399
Jesus!

626
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,389
You know there's a reason
they call Karos "Captain Fisty".

627
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:09,720
All right. You, uh...

628
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,530
Ew.

629
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:23,949
<i>The Midnight Shadows Social Club
didn't have a single fixed address.</i>

630
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:27,129
<i>It was a horrible,
hedonistic little road show,</i>

631
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:31,209
<i>that would pop up at a new
and unsuspecting location each time.</i>

632
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:35,999
<i>Rumor had it they once desecrated the
Right Field Pavilion at Dodger Stadium,</i>

633
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,809
<i>but because it was the first inning...</i>

634
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:40,719
<i>nobody was there to witness it.</i>

635
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,470
Midnight Shadow.

636
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:48,980
- Uh, Mr. Karos...
- No name.

637
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,050
Entry fee.

638
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,990
There you go.

639
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:12,890
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

640
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:16,230
It's all here.

641
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:21,370
I'm leaving now. Bye-bye.

642
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,120
This ought to be interesting.

643
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:30,630
There we go.

644
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:39,129
I'm not sure, but...

645
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:42,269
I think someone just got
pregnant in there.

646
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:44,379
Ovulating.

647
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:46,309
- Uh..oh.
- Whatever.

648
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:48,600
Tell your mom I said hi.

649
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:53,670
Mr. Karos?

650
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:57,120
He had a disco ball... Mr. Karos?

651
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:03,180
- I didn't see you get out of the car.
- Nor did I.

652
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:10,419
Are you completely flipped out?

653
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:12,289
I drove Charlie Sheen for six weeks.

654
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:13,779
Who's he?

655
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:15,779
- Doesn't matter.
- Doesn't matter.

656
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:18,389
We're out of blow and these bitches
are aardvarks.

657
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:21,159
- Okay.
- Bring back as much as you can carry.

658
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,379
- Okay.
- All right.

659
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:26,409
The Xavier Club, Hollywood,
you ask for Laurant.

660
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:28,519
He's a Frenchman. He has a briefcase.

661
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,869
You bring it back to me, no matter what.

662
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:34,599
Under no circumstances
do you fail in this endeavor,

663
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,649
or our entire night is null and void,
understood?

664
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:39,450
Understood.

665
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:43,339
This is on a countdown.

666
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:46,699
It's set up for 99 minutes
which is exactly how long I'll be inside.

667
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:50,520
You come back before it runs out.
Not a minute more.

668
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:54,319
There's a lot of money in this, Stretch.

669
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:57,020
Maybe $6,000.

670
00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:01,059
Tell me to have fun.

671
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,540
Enjoy yourself over there.

672
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,760
There's no joy in there.

673
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:09,970
Uh..oh.

674
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:30,589
- Hey, babe.
- Hey, cockfucker.

675
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:32,629
- Uh, Naseem...
- Bring the limo back.

676
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:34,129
- You're fired.
- What?

677
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:35,509
Fired? I got us Liotta.

678
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:37,329
Liotta says he wants to kill you!

679
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:40,299
You don't return a registered weapon
after he paid you to?

680
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,049
<i>What the fuck?</i>

681
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:44,319
Bring the limo back or I swear to God,

682
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,889
the cops are sitting right in front of me,
I'm gonna tell him you stole it.

683
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:49,019
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Wait, Naseem, listen,

684
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:50,599
I am with a client, Mr. Karos.

685
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:55,509
No! I told you, this is do,
or this is die,

686
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:58,149
and you're fucking dead!

687
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:00,479
You're dead! Dead! Dead...

688
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,009
I gotta go.

689
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:03,860
Hello?

690
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,779
Motherfucker hung up on me.

691
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:09,040
<i>Charlie!</i>

692
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:17,610
Right there.

693
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:20,109
Hey, can I park here for a few minutes?

694
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:22,900
Fuck, no. Are you kidding?

695
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,439
Can I park it here for a few minutes?

696
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,739
Stay as long as you want.

697
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:29,460
<i>Just long enough
to pick up a briefcase.</i>

698
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:32,030
<i>Because I'm all in now.</i>

699
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,880
<i>Huh.</i>

700
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:42,810
<i>Get the briefcase.</i>

701
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:45,429
<i>Get it.</i>

702
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:49,179
<i>Miami,</i>

703
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:52,689
<i>but didn't get it because
the casting director felt I didn't,</i>

704
00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:55,129
<i>as she put it, "Own the space".</i>

705
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:56,889
Excuse me. Thank you.

706
00:43:56,890 --> 00:44:00,710
I'm, uh, looking for a man named Laurant.

707
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:03,390
Not seeing that name.

708
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,979
Oh, there he is.

709
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:07,929
- Elevator inside.
- Thank you.

710
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:10,460
- He's up in VIP.
- Hold that.

711
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:16,229
<i>I don't think I understood
what they meant until this very moment.</i>

712
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:19,129
<i>Because the truth of the matter is...</i>

713
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:23,330
<i>I ain't getting a sniff of that briefcase
without heeding those words.</i>

714
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:26,420
Yeah, it's not Karos...

715
00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:30,019
<i>You can do this.</i>

716
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:33,409
<i>Own the space. Own the space.</i>

717
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:35,429
<i>- Own the space.</i>
- Billy Big Balls,

718
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:37,379
becomes Geisha Bitch Boy.

719
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:39,989
Running errands for a mad man.

720
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:43,529
- Shut up.
- You're not getting that money.

721
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:47,880
And then Ignacio is gonna break
every part of you that can be broken.

722
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:53,940
Who, but an absolute asshole
would bank on a $6,000 tip?

723
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:56,970
Fuck you.

724
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:05,619
- "Laurent"?
- Laurant.

725
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:08,099
- La... what?
- La...

726
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:09,830
rant.

727
00:45:11,310 --> 00:45:14,139
- Mr. Karos sent me.
- Mmm..hmm.

728
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:16,199
You have something for me?

729
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,529
I have something for Monsieur Karos.

730
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:20,289
Well, I'm here in his place.

731
00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:21,820
Mmm.

732
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:28,149
To pick up a briefcase
and return to him in 78 minutes.

733
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:30,869
- Is he timing you?
- He is.

734
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:33,149
And why would he be timing you?

735
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:35,169
Well, you'd have to ask him.

736
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:38,489
Would I have to ask him
about my ledgers as well?

737
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:41,039
This was supposed to be an exchange.

738
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,959
Wasn't that explained to you?

739
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:46,719
Ledger for briefcase.

740
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,009
Ledger for briefcase.

741
00:45:49,010 --> 00:45:51,639
- Ledger...
- Oh, so let me get this straight.

742
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:54,300
It was ledgers for briefcase?

743
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,330
Where is Monsieur Karos now?

744
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:00,869
I really couldn't tell you.

745
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:03,390
I'm certain you could.

746
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:06,199
Look around you.

747
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:10,770
Mon vieil ami, he has put you into
very bad spot with very bad people.

748
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:13,910
<i>Own the space.</i>

749
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:16,499
Yeah, all right, listen.

750
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,700
"Laurent".

751
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:21,329
Easy.

752
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:26,120
You want an LAPD Tactical Team
on your ass in the next 10 seconds?

753
00:46:26,270 --> 00:46:27,479
Huh?

754
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,890
Then keep fucking with me!

755
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:32,440
You see it?

756
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:35,979
I'll get you your ledgers,
you have my word.

757
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:39,359
But right now, you're gonna give me
that goddamn briefcase,

758
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:42,519
or I'm gonna turn this VIP room
into a goddamn pig roast

759
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,739
with more cops than you can count.

760
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:46,669
When the smoke clears,

761
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:49,419
and you're in LA County,
hip-deep in hardened cons

762
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:51,919
who wanna double park
their dicks in your hind hole,

763
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,289
you're gonna be wishing
you had this moment back.

764
00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:59,429
Wishing that you had taken the word
of a heavily decorated,

765
00:46:59,430 --> 00:47:02,409
veteran police officer,

766
00:47:02,410 --> 00:47:06,319
instead of trying to play tough guy
in your tennis whites.

767
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:08,689
So come on, Crayola,

768
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:12,340
you wanna color or what?

769
00:47:17,850 --> 00:47:21,280
75 minutes.

770
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:35,330
I'll get you your ledgers.

771
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:38,429
You have my word,

772
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:41,320
and I'm a man of my word.

773
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:49,669
I see a lot of eyeballs.

774
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:52,549
You better put them on a fucking dimmer

775
00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:56,170
before I put cases on all of you bitches!

776
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:03,960
Make a lane. Make a lane.

777
00:48:21,290 --> 00:48:25,179
Who the fuck was that guy?

778
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:29,060
Yay!
I can't believe I just did that.

779
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,609
Where the fuck is Karos?

780
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:33,389
That was awesome!

781
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:34,509
- Right?
- Yeah.

782
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:36,659
Tonight, get this guy or he's gone.

783
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:38,129
I'm not gonna lie to you,

784
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:39,669
I'm pretty impressed.

785
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:41,999
Non-extradition country ghost!

786
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,149
Don't get cocky.

787
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:46,059
The agreement was ledgers in the hand,

788
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:48,579
him in person.
This is 10 months of undercover work,

789
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:51,369
six months of Rosetta Stone
learning fucking French.

790
00:48:51,370 --> 00:48:53,169
I hate the fucking French!

791
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:55,059
- Fuck!
- Hey, relax. We'll get him.

792
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:56,709
Get a hold of the justice
lawyers downstairs,

793
00:48:56,710 --> 00:48:58,859
tell them to sit tight,
do not let them book flights home.

794
00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:00,239
Order them room service.

795
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,719
Call the LAPD,
run deep background on this asshole.

796
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:06,790
'Cause I need to find out everything
known and unknown about this shithead!

797
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:16,700
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

798
00:49:17,390 --> 00:49:19,350
<i>Candice.</i>

799
00:49:19,370 --> 00:49:20,970
<i>Fuck.</i>

800
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:23,720
<i>Fuck!</i>

801
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:27,159
<i>Whatever you do, don't follow her.</i>

802
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:29,749
<i>Ah, you're following her.</i>

803
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:33,799
<i>The chances of seeing her tonight
have gotta be fucking astronomical.</i>

804
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:36,559
<i>Right, you need to turn around and leave.</i>

805
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,249
<i>You're not leaving, you idiot.</i>

806
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:41,879
<i>Do you not recall those wicked little
left hooks to the heart she threw,</i>

807
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:45,479
<i>that knocked your ass flat
for an entire fucking year?</i>

808
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:49,140
<i>All you are doing
is chasing more punishment.</i>

809
00:49:51,930 --> 00:49:55,090
<i>Seriously, what are you doing?</i>

810
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:59,049
Club soda.

811
00:49:59,050 --> 00:50:00,469
<i>All right. Great, okay.</i>

812
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:03,200
<i>Well, you're here, what's
the play, hotshot?</i>

813
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:09,870
You guys, I'm just gonna be right back.
I'm gonna get more.

814
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:12,199
<i>Right. Here she comes.</i>

815
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:14,529
<i>- Say something cool.</i>
- Oh, my God.

816
00:50:14,530 --> 00:50:16,529
- Kevin.
- What?

817
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:18,169
- Hey!
- Hi.

818
00:50:18,170 --> 00:50:20,189
- How are you?
- Good.

819
00:50:20,190 --> 00:50:21,659
- Yeah.
- You?

820
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:23,989
Yeah, um, it's... yeah, good, it's my...

821
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:26,909
- It's...
- Ah, bachelorette party I'm gonna guess.

822
00:50:26,910 --> 00:50:29,550
- Yeah.
- Good. Um...

823
00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:32,729
Great suit. You look... you look good.

824
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:34,249
You look better.

825
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:36,309
Congratulations, too.

826
00:50:36,310 --> 00:50:37,669
- Really?
- Yeah.

827
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:41,029
- You mean it?
- Of course, of course.
I'm so happy for you.

828
00:50:41,030 --> 00:50:42,309
- Happy?
- Yeah.

829
00:50:42,310 --> 00:50:44,130
- Really?
- You bet.

830
00:50:44,590 --> 00:50:46,919
Are you... are you meeting someone or...

831
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:49,089
I'm actually here on
business, unfortunately.

832
00:50:49,090 --> 00:50:51,309
A client, right? Someone you're driving?

833
00:50:51,310 --> 00:50:52,319
No, no, no.

834
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:56,269
I'm not really, uh,
driving anymore, Candice.

835
00:50:56,270 --> 00:50:58,909
I'm being driven.

836
00:50:58,910 --> 00:51:00,160
Hmm.

837
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:04,899
Uh, could I get a vodka juice, please?
Thank you.

838
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:07,340
What do you mean?

839
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:15,530
Are you carrying a gun?

840
00:51:15,930 --> 00:51:18,400
I seriously can't talk about it.

841
00:51:21,810 --> 00:51:24,570
It's better that I go.

842
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:28,039
<i>Subject arrived in a stretch limo.</i>

843
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:30,459
<i>There's bullet holes in the side panel.
They look recent.</i>

844
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:33,489
<i>And a check on the license plate
says the limo reported as stolen.</i>

845
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:36,209
Tag that limo! This asshole
will lead us straight to Karos,

846
00:51:36,210 --> 00:51:38,629
but you're gonna put
rotating parallels on him.

847
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:40,819
No straight tails because if he's a cop,

848
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:42,119
<i>he's gonna sniff 'em out.</i>

849
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:43,520
<i>Copy that.</i>

850
00:51:49,450 --> 00:51:51,339
- So?
- Yeah?

851
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:54,459
- What's in there?
- Oh, can't say.

852
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:57,380
- Is it money?
- Hmm.

853
00:51:57,620 --> 00:52:02,210
You're not mixed up
in anything illegal, are you?

854
00:52:03,790 --> 00:52:05,899
Candice.

855
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:07,900
Thank you.

856
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,729
Thank you.

857
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:14,509
You have no idea what
your leaving did for me.

858
00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:19,729
And by breaking up with me
you gave me the greatest gift ever.

859
00:52:19,730 --> 00:52:23,029
The life that I always wanted,

860
00:52:23,030 --> 00:52:25,880
I now have.

861
00:52:27,330 --> 00:52:29,990
There we go.

862
00:52:30,850 --> 00:52:32,729
You just seem so together.

863
00:52:32,730 --> 00:52:33,789
You know, I don't know.

864
00:52:33,790 --> 00:52:36,249
You look... you look better
than I've ever seen you.

865
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:38,049
- Ready for your car, sir?
- Yeah.

866
00:52:38,050 --> 00:52:40,529
So, listen, um, we're gonna go out

867
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:42,719
if maybe you wanna see one another later.

868
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:46,079
Candice, you need to enjoy
your last night of freedom.

869
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:49,660
I need you to go upstairs now, okay?
All right?

870
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:55,769
Suspect is in front of the club
conversing with an unknown female.

871
00:52:55,770 --> 00:52:57,739
You're gonna make a beautiful bride

872
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:01,080
and a wonderful, wonderful wife.

873
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,099
Bye.

874
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:05,299
Twenty bucks if you drive me out of here.

875
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:06,809
Make it 40 and I'll do it.

876
00:53:06,810 --> 00:53:08,039
Fucker.

877
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:11,010
Just get the door for me, please?

878
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:14,500
- There you go.
- Oh.

879
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:18,690
Oh, blowing a kiss, huh?

880
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:38,759
Bro, who the fuck was that?

881
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,479
An ex or something?

882
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:43,069
No, dude. That was the ex.

883
00:53:43,070 --> 00:53:45,640
What? Did she dump your ass?

884
00:53:46,030 --> 00:53:47,829
She destroyed me.

885
00:53:47,830 --> 00:53:50,709
- Well, payback's a bitch. Am I right?
- Yes, it is. You are right.

886
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:52,489
How long have you been planning
that stunt?

887
00:53:52,490 --> 00:53:54,949
I didn't. It just... it just happened.

888
00:53:54,950 --> 00:53:57,710
She look like that
when you went out with her?

889
00:53:57,780 --> 00:53:59,619
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

890
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:02,319
- That bitch is fucking fine.
- Thank you.

891
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,409
- She have those tits when you dated her?
- Uh, yeah.

892
00:54:04,410 --> 00:54:05,949
Those things look natural, were they?

893
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:08,889
Okay, see, the principle of a payback
is that you get to enjoy it.

894
00:54:08,890 --> 00:54:10,649
And I'm not being able
to do that right now.

895
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:13,539
- You know what I'd like to enjoy?
Those tits.
- I gotcha. I gotcha.

896
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:16,929
Ever do that thing
where you put your dick between them?

897
00:54:16,930 --> 00:54:18,159
Uh..oh.

898
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:19,869
What'd you just do?

899
00:54:19,870 --> 00:54:21,929
Fuck. Your limo just lost power, man.

900
00:54:21,930 --> 00:54:24,719
- Did you just do that?
- Oh, now this NavStar light's blinking.

901
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,409
- What?
- That's probably bad news.

902
00:54:26,410 --> 00:54:27,970
Oh, fuck!

903
00:54:29,990 --> 00:54:31,679
- Stretch?
- What? Hey...

904
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:34,559
Did they just use the NavStar system
to disable the limo?

905
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:36,159
Yes, they did.

906
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,049
- God damn it.
- I'm outta here, bro.

907
00:54:38,050 --> 00:54:39,459
- Good luck!
- Where you going?

908
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:40,899
Hold on, Charlie. I'll call
you back! Wait!

909
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:42,599
- Stretch!
- Hey, man, where you going?

910
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:43,929
Bro, this car is dead.

911
00:54:43,930 --> 00:54:47,489
- Can you help me push, please?
- No, it's not going anywhere.
Oh, hey! Look!

912
00:54:47,490 --> 00:54:49,509
Shit! Come on! Come on!

913
00:54:49,510 --> 00:54:51,199
Get back on the wheel
and please help me push.

914
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,459
- Take the tow truck!
- I can't take the tow truck, all right?

915
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:55,199
I got a client! Shut the fuck up!

916
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,909
Hey! Hey! Be nice to me!

917
00:54:56,910 --> 00:54:58,299
- Hey! I'm being nice to you!
- I'm helping you!

918
00:54:58,300 --> 00:54:59,589
- You're doing a great job!
- I'm helping you!

919
00:54:59,590 --> 00:55:01,979
Thank you!
Thank you for that positive feedback.

920
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:04,069
- I could do with less sarcasm.
- You're doing wonderful. Fantastic.

921
00:55:04,070 --> 00:55:06,239
- We should go out sometime.
- Really? Do you mean that?

922
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:07,719
- No!
- Because a bunch of my buddies

923
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:08,589
just got married

924
00:55:08,590 --> 00:55:10,039
and I don't have a lot of people
to hang out with.

925
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,739
That's shocking to me.
Just push the fucking car.

926
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:16,019
- Oh, shit. It's fucking power steering.
- Just push and shut up!

927
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:19,239
Come on, come on. Here we go.

928
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:22,339
You just got it on the curb and in a
red-zone. What the fuck is wrong with you?

929
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:24,139
- Come on! Just push it a little further.
- What?

930
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:25,899
Just get it a little further.
We're in the red-zone.

931
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:27,409
There is no further.
You're up on the curb now.

932
00:55:27,410 --> 00:55:29,540
Come on, man! I'm a...

933
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:33,819
- Just help me push it a little further.
- You're definitely gonna get towed
right here.

934
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:36,500
Fine, fine, fine, fine. Here.

935
00:55:36,550 --> 00:55:39,089
- Pleasure doing business with you, man.
- Yeah.

936
00:55:39,090 --> 00:55:41,789
Eat your own dick! Suck it!

937
00:55:41,790 --> 00:55:44,909
<i>If I lose this limo now,
it's game over.</i>

938
00:55:44,910 --> 00:55:47,129
<i>I'm done. My fate is sealed.</i>

939
00:55:47,130 --> 00:55:48,119
Oh, God.

940
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:51,299
Come on, start! Start. Come on, start!

941
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:52,949
<i>Holy shit. The Jovi.</i>

942
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:54,639
I don't know about you, hoss,

943
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:57,539
<i>but I don't like where this is headed.</i>

944
00:55:57,540 --> 00:56:00,330
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

945
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:06,519
<i>The vehicle you are
occupying has been reported stolen.</i>

946
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:08,139
<i>The engine functions have been disabled.</i>

947
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:09,700
Come on! Damn it!

948
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:14,599
<i>Whether that fate is a wrath-of-God-like
beating from Boris there,</i>

949
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:18,309
<i>or just wasting away in a life
I never intended to live,</i>

950
00:56:18,310 --> 00:56:21,610
<i>it's got me cornered now.</i>

951
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:23,849
God, he's really big.

952
00:56:23,850 --> 00:56:26,499
<i>Maybe all this was inevitable.</i>

953
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:30,130
<i>Facing this now. Figuring
it out on the fly.</i>

954
00:56:30,210 --> 00:56:34,559
<i>Life doesn't allow you to rehearse.
You just have to...</i>

955
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:36,689
<i>live and learn.</i>

956
00:56:36,690 --> 00:56:39,109
<i>God damn it. That has to mean something.</i>

957
00:56:39,110 --> 00:56:41,569
<i>What do I want it to mean?</i>

958
00:56:41,570 --> 00:56:44,180
<i>And what the hell do I do with it?</i>

959
00:56:47,930 --> 00:56:51,380
That's what I'm talking about!

960
00:56:54,590 --> 00:56:58,120
You know, that really works.

961
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:05,039
<i>This is the NavStar operator.</i>

962
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:07,649
Ma'am, this is Detective Raymond Liotta
of the LAPD.

963
00:57:07,650 --> 00:57:10,219
I am occupying the stolen vehicle
and I am pinned down

964
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:13,690
in a gun battle with
the armed suspects who stole...

965
00:57:14,090 --> 00:57:17,489
Ma'am! You have got to
start this car for me!

966
00:57:17,490 --> 00:57:19,049
Oh, God, Bill! Are you dead?

967
00:57:19,050 --> 00:57:20,609
- Oh, man, I think he's dead.
<i>- Oh, my God.</i>

968
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:22,249
Bill! Bill! Are you hit? You're hit!

969
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:23,919
Oh, my God! Ma'am, he's hit!

970
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:25,169
<i>Officer, what is going on?</i>

971
00:57:25,170 --> 00:57:27,989
Oh, my partner's been gun shot.
There's so much blood everywhere!

972
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:31,449
<i>- Oh, my God.</i>
- They keep firing at us, ma'am!

973
00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:34,639
They keep firing! Start
this car for me, please!

974
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:37,249
Come on, Billy! Come on, Billy!

975
00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:40,329
Oh, God! I'm outta ammo.
Bill, we're gonna die.

976
00:57:40,330 --> 00:57:42,349
I'm so sorry! I tried!

977
00:57:42,350 --> 00:57:45,180
I did everything I could!

978
00:57:45,490 --> 00:57:49,940
We're good! We're good. We gotta go
to the hospital now. Thank you so much!

979
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:06,039
Get it! Get it! Get it! Motherfucker!
That's what I'm talking about! Fuck CSI!

980
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:07,529
Well, you just might get

981
00:58:07,530 --> 00:58:09,899
your SAG card after all, princess.

982
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:13,219
Hey, suspect was involved
in a shots-fired incident

983
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:14,469
up in Hollywood Boulevard.

984
00:58:14,470 --> 00:58:15,679
- When?
- Just now!

985
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:20,380
Unless he's killing people in the street,
we don't touch him until he has Karos
in tow.

986
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:25,160
Holy shit.

987
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:33,729
- How's the hunt?
- Iggy, I'm so close.

988
00:58:33,730 --> 00:58:35,329
How close?

989
00:58:35,330 --> 00:58:38,869
I'm staring at hundreds of thousands
of dollars as we speak.

990
00:58:38,870 --> 00:58:42,509
Andale. Well, shave six Gs off that shit.
I'll meet you in 30.

991
00:58:42,510 --> 00:58:43,959
Yeah, wish it were that easy.

992
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:48,549
Mira, Stretch. If $6,000 isn't delivered
to me by 12:01 AM

993
00:58:48,550 --> 00:58:51,079
<i>you're gonna see some shit
up close you'll never forget.</i>

994
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:52,990
Because you won't be able to.

995
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:59,290
Oh, fuck.

996
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:03,809
Stop.

997
00:59:03,810 --> 00:59:06,399
Ay, what up, player?

998
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:09,079
Trying to get this fine
set of dimes up Sunset.

999
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:12,179
- My boys gots a table and
the goose is loose.
- Ah!

1000
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:14,919
- Grab a cab, yeezy. I'm busy.
- Hey, dude!

1001
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:17,359
- You don't recognize me?
- No.

1002
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:18,629
I'm ACB, man!

1003
00:59:18,630 --> 00:59:19,599
I was on Idol!

1004
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:23,659
Nigga, Cee Lo Green be all up in my shit
trying to get me signed to his label, dog.

1005
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:26,910
These girlies are my backup singers.
Come here, girls!

1006
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:29,549
Wanna hear something?
Little bit of sample do?

1007
00:59:29,550 --> 00:59:32,089
- No.
- All right, dude, this is
from my new album,

1008
00:59:32,090 --> 00:59:33,349
Bitches and Tits.

1009
00:59:33,350 --> 00:59:35,759
This is the single It's Raining Tits.
You ready?

1010
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:36,839
Oh, my God.

1011
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:40,089
<i>We be getting all romantic,
watching Titantic</i>

1012
00:59:40,090 --> 00:59:43,509
<i>- You roll up on me quick
- Let me suck your dick</i>

1013
00:59:43,510 --> 00:59:47,029
<i>You can suck my dick</i>

1014
00:59:47,030 --> 00:59:50,340
<i>Baby</i>

1015
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:53,169
Wow.

1016
00:59:53,170 --> 00:59:55,169
- That's really terrible.
- Come on, dude!

1017
00:59:55,170 --> 00:59:57,589
I just sang for my supper, homie.

1018
00:59:57,590 --> 01:00:00,529
It's like a 10-minute ride, dude.
Let me Jigga-Jay-Z this motherfucker.

1019
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:02,789
- Fifty bucks per block.
- Damn, nigga!

1020
01:00:02,790 --> 01:00:04,969
Why you gotta do me
like this in a public place?

1021
01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:08,699
Because you're a giant bag. That's why.
Look at you.

1022
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:12,280
Has your father stopped crying?

1023
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:18,469
Three-hundy. Best I can do.

1024
01:00:18,470 --> 01:00:19,939
And the coke.

1025
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:22,599
- What coke?
- Those three chicken heads wouldn't get

1026
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:26,860
within spitting distance of you unless
you got some yay. Now, gimme.

1027
01:00:29,490 --> 01:00:32,329
- I like you.
- I don't like you.

1028
01:00:32,330 --> 01:00:34,389
- You got Facebook, dude?
- Fuck off.

1029
01:00:34,390 --> 01:00:37,599
All right. Let's ride, ladies.

1030
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:40,709
Suspect is engaged with
an unidentified white male,

1031
01:00:40,710 --> 01:00:42,889
who's accompanied by three females.

1032
01:00:42,890 --> 01:00:46,530
Stay put! That sounds like Karos.
We're en route right now.

1033
01:00:50,490 --> 01:00:53,600
<i>Come on, girls! It's shower time, baby!</i>

1034
01:00:53,910 --> 01:00:56,849
<i>Pop bottles on the J-Lo!</i>

1035
01:00:56,850 --> 01:00:58,319
Hey, chill out back there.

1036
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:00,019
Them vocals is golden, dude.

1037
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:02,720
It's gonna be a platinum record
for real, homie.

1038
01:01:04,490 --> 01:01:06,649
<i>Is that spray paint?</i>

1039
01:01:06,650 --> 01:01:08,889
- Stretch?
- Put the spray paint away.

1040
01:01:08,890 --> 01:01:10,559
Put the spray paint away.

1041
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:12,639
Ah, fuck!

1042
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:14,439
Stretch!

1043
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:17,819
- All right.
- You are going to jail.

1044
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:20,409
<i>The police put out a
warrant for your arrest.</i>

1045
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:22,349
Wait. Where... where's the limo?

1046
01:01:22,350 --> 01:01:24,559
- Driving down Sunset with me.
- It's running?

1047
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:27,620
- How?
- My friends at NavStar.

1048
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:31,899
Stretch!

1049
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:33,299
<i>Stretch!</i>

1050
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:35,389
<i>You are a wanted felon.</i>

1051
01:01:35,390 --> 01:01:37,609
Are you fucking delusional?

1052
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:41,359
Listen, I'm gonna finish this night with
Karos, collect my fee and then hit restart.

1053
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:43,399
<i>Love, life, career, all of it.</i>

1054
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:45,799
All this weirdness that
I got sucked into tonight,

1055
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:48,019
it rebuilt my mojo!

1056
01:01:48,020 --> 01:01:50,209
Do you not get what's going on here?

1057
01:01:50,210 --> 01:01:52,209
Come on. Not only do I get it,
I'm getting the better of it.

1058
01:01:52,210 --> 01:01:54,579
I am beating a game that
kicks my ass on a regular basis.

1059
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:56,359
Remember how you said I was a fatalist

1060
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:58,599
that couldn't function unless everything
around me was turning to shit?

1061
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:01,869
Well, guess what? That is happening,
and I am thriving. Do you understand that?

1062
01:02:01,870 --> 01:02:04,019
It's like the worse it
gets, the better I am.

1063
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:06,480
It's like I'm five steps ahead.

1064
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:10,260
<i>You can suck my dick, baby!</i>

1065
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:14,050
Fuck!

1066
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:26,859
Sunset and Cahuenga, right now!

1067
01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:28,379
Karos just stole the limo.

1068
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:31,540
The driver's outside removing
the license plates, and he just took off!

1069
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:34,040
Oh, shit.

1070
01:02:34,390 --> 01:02:36,189
Hey, man. Excuse me.

1071
01:02:36,190 --> 01:02:38,999
You see some punk Kanye West
wannabe white boy

1072
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,159
come through here with a shitty mohawk?

1073
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:43,179
All right. Um...

1074
01:02:43,180 --> 01:02:45,739
I'm gonna need your car.

1075
01:02:45,740 --> 01:02:49,149
Oh, you mean, like,
the police commandeer your car?

1076
01:02:49,150 --> 01:02:51,429
- Yeah.
- No.

1077
01:02:51,430 --> 01:02:54,970
Unless you're really Officer...

1078
01:02:55,410 --> 01:02:57,600
Ray Liotta.

1079
01:02:57,650 --> 01:02:59,969
You thought the badge was
a slam dunk, didn't you?

1080
01:02:59,970 --> 01:03:02,079
I did... I did though. I really did.
Why wouldn't I?

1081
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:03,789
Hey, the delivery was good, man.

1082
01:03:03,790 --> 01:03:05,479
- Man, I appreciate it. Thank you.
- It was solid. I was impressed.

1083
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:07,769
- Thank you. Got something going for me.
- Hey!

1084
01:03:07,770 --> 01:03:09,809
So, how many times
you're gonna tell this story, huh?

1085
01:03:09,810 --> 01:03:12,199
Shithead limo driver impersonating a cop.

1086
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:14,509
It's classic, man. I'm gonna get
a lot of mileage out of this.

1087
01:03:14,510 --> 01:03:16,329
- Yeah, I don't blame you.
- I mean, you'd do the same.

1088
01:03:16,330 --> 01:03:17,869
Oh, in a second. Are you kidding me?

1089
01:03:17,870 --> 01:03:19,849
And if that's the case,
we might as well give the story

1090
01:03:19,850 --> 01:03:21,289
- the ending it deserves, right?
- Hey, why not?

1091
01:03:21,290 --> 01:03:24,300
Now, give me your fucking car
before I put a bullet in your liver!

1092
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:26,079
Gun!

1093
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:28,059
- Oh, shit!
- Yeah!

1094
01:03:28,060 --> 01:03:29,789
Get that motherfucker!

1095
01:03:29,790 --> 01:03:31,790
Oh, shit!

1096
01:03:32,050 --> 01:03:34,069
You better run, white boy!

1097
01:03:34,070 --> 01:03:35,609
So what's the plan, Stretch!

1098
01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:38,750
Successfully outrunning
black men over flat surfaces?

1099
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:49,069
Oh, God!

1100
01:03:49,070 --> 01:03:50,699
Where'd he go?

1101
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:52,780
Okay, crank it.

1102
01:03:59,850 --> 01:04:02,029
- Oh.
- Are you all right?

1103
01:04:02,030 --> 01:04:03,889
- No.
- Time's up, white boy!

1104
01:04:03,890 --> 01:04:06,200
Sweet Jesus! Coloreds!

1105
01:04:09,980 --> 01:04:12,959
- He got hit by a car!
- That's what you get!

1106
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:16,520
- God damn it! Stop running!
- Bring that motherfucker back over here!

1107
01:04:30,070 --> 01:04:35,179
That is fascinating.
I mean, the way that you told that story.

1108
01:04:35,180 --> 01:04:36,989
That's not...

1109
01:04:36,990 --> 01:04:38,479
They got the limo.

1110
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:40,629
Karos wasn't inside.
Some dumb ass kid boosted it.

1111
01:04:40,630 --> 01:04:43,439
He's got a bunch of fucking
coked up club girls in the back.

1112
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:45,749
<i>- Did they recover the case?
- They have not located it yet.</i>

1113
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:49,259
You get that limo towed to the nearest
impound yard and stripped to the chassis,

1114
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:52,400
and find that fucking driver!

1115
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:05,509
<i>Oh, doll, I would love to
text you back right now,</i>

1116
01:05:05,510 --> 01:05:08,450
<i>but I got bigger problems. Fuck me!</i>

1117
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:12,049
<i>You gotta get the limo back. Think.</i>

1118
01:05:12,050 --> 01:05:13,499
<i>Think, God damn it.</i>

1119
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:15,079
<i>Hey, Bubba,
get the CHP on the line</i>

1120
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:17,629
and tell them to close
the Eastbound lane to the 101 and the 134.

1121
01:05:17,630 --> 01:05:19,850
I want sawhorses and spike strips.

1122
01:05:21,780 --> 01:05:23,909
<i>Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.</i>

1123
01:05:23,910 --> 01:05:26,109
<i>Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.</i>

1124
01:05:26,110 --> 01:05:29,710
<i>Slow is smooth, smooth is faster.
Oh, Shit!</i>

1125
01:05:34,540 --> 01:05:36,620
<i>Shit!</i>

1126
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:42,310
<i>Fuck you!</i>

1127
01:05:56,580 --> 01:05:59,290
Oh, shi...

1128
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:11,430
You're gonna die out here, dickhead.

1129
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:28,560
<i>Oh, my. Fuck me!</i>

1130
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:32,310
You gotta be shitting me.

1131
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:39,320
Of course.

1132
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:42,980
Fuck.

1133
01:06:43,820 --> 01:06:46,029
<i>When did they have time to do this?</i>

1134
01:06:46,030 --> 01:06:48,669
<i>You can suck my dick, baby!</i>

1135
01:06:48,670 --> 01:06:51,989
- Jesus.
- I love what they've done with the place.

1136
01:06:51,990 --> 01:06:54,089
I can't take it back to
Karos looking like this.

1137
01:06:54,090 --> 01:06:56,089
Bro, not to point out the obvious,

1138
01:06:56,090 --> 01:07:00,130
you're still attached to a tow-truck
on the fucking freeway.

1139
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:24,830
Oh...

1140
01:07:25,890 --> 01:07:29,490
Fuck you, motherfucker!

1141
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:31,310
Shit!

1142
01:07:32,890 --> 01:07:36,080
Hey, buddy, you like that?

1143
01:07:37,750 --> 01:07:40,450
Here we go again!

1144
01:07:41,150 --> 01:07:43,040
Damn it!

1145
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:26,409
Come on, start, God damn it!

1146
01:08:26,410 --> 01:08:29,059
Come on, come on, come on, come on. Start!

1147
01:08:29,060 --> 01:08:31,060
Come on!

1148
01:08:31,570 --> 01:08:33,889
Come on, I am begging you!

1149
01:08:33,890 --> 01:08:35,560
Shit!

1150
01:08:36,050 --> 01:08:37,979
Fuck me! Come on!

1151
01:08:37,980 --> 01:08:39,729
- Turn on!
- Hello, baby.

1152
01:08:39,730 --> 01:08:41,029
I am begging you right now.

1153
01:08:41,030 --> 01:08:43,030
We have rape party, huh?

1154
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:47,680
We're not gonna have a rape party.

1155
01:08:49,110 --> 01:08:51,220
Little baby pussy.

1156
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:55,410
There you go!

1157
01:08:55,900 --> 01:08:57,960
Bye-bye!

1158
01:08:59,230 --> 01:09:00,770
Uh..oh.

1159
01:09:05,010 --> 01:09:06,390
Buddy!

1160
01:09:16,780 --> 01:09:18,490
Okay.

1161
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:25,469
The limo was retaken.

1162
01:09:25,470 --> 01:09:27,650
It was what?

1163
01:09:27,890 --> 01:09:29,950
Fuck!

1164
01:09:30,550 --> 01:09:34,720
The tow truck driver tried to stop him.
The fucking cop got away!

1165
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:39,509
This cop is obviously on
a schedule with Karos.

1166
01:09:39,510 --> 01:09:41,849
We got to get to him fast

1167
01:09:41,850 --> 01:09:43,850
or Karos is gone.

1168
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:45,759
I want everybody pulled out right now.

1169
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:48,239
LAPD, Sheriff's Department, CHP.

1170
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:50,289
You make 'em task force loan-outs.

1171
01:09:50,290 --> 01:09:52,920
Get a chopper up there, too.

1172
01:09:53,490 --> 01:09:58,080
Next time Karos shows his face,
we take the whole fucking thing down.

1173
01:10:07,810 --> 01:10:11,060
Hey, it's Stretch.
You know what to do.

1174
01:10:13,010 --> 01:10:15,539
Come on, Karos. Where are you, man?

1175
01:10:15,540 --> 01:10:17,340
Let's go.

1176
01:10:22,460 --> 01:10:25,400
<i>Delinquents, take your mark.</i>

1177
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:34,310
What the fuck?

1178
01:11:02,130 --> 01:11:04,950
Oh, shit!

1179
01:11:31,250 --> 01:11:34,390
- You're late.
- I'm not late.

1180
01:11:44,250 --> 01:11:47,059
Did this limo get squat-fucked by Satan?

1181
01:11:47,060 --> 01:11:47,829
Hmm.

1182
01:11:47,830 --> 01:11:49,409
Along with your wardrobe?

1183
01:11:49,410 --> 01:11:51,609
What in the patron saint of shit happened?

1184
01:11:51,610 --> 01:11:54,769
Couple of twists and turns.
Few complications.

1185
01:11:54,770 --> 01:11:56,809
Did you get the briefcase?

1186
01:11:56,810 --> 01:11:59,339
- Laurent mentioned some ledgers.
- Did you get the briefcase?

1187
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:00,829
I got the briefcase.

1188
01:12:00,830 --> 01:12:04,009
Yes, I gave my word that
I would return with those ledgers.

1189
01:12:04,010 --> 01:12:07,570
Where's the fucking briefcase?

1190
01:12:09,260 --> 01:12:12,050
Under your seat.

1191
01:12:19,650 --> 01:12:22,700
Oh, you're a Magic Mike.

1192
01:12:23,780 --> 01:12:25,269
I'm here.

1193
01:12:25,270 --> 01:12:30,539
No, no, no, no. Public. I said public,
I want public. That's not public.

1194
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:34,359
You do it out in the open, then it's you
and I to the air strip and no one else.

1195
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:38,379
There's a place called Kite on Ivar.
Meet me there in 20.

1196
01:12:38,380 --> 01:12:42,350
My balls are itchy.
Did you get my blow?

1197
01:12:42,460 --> 01:12:45,540
Oh, sweet mama.

1198
01:12:51,030 --> 01:12:54,470
- No, I'm good.
- I wasn't gonna give it to you anyway.

1199
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:03,389
What's the problem?

1200
01:13:03,390 --> 01:13:06,400
You get a thumb in the ass that I missed?

1201
01:13:06,950 --> 01:13:09,929
- Pretty rough night, Rog.
- Mmm..hmm.

1202
01:13:09,930 --> 01:13:13,449
I'm not sure even the clothes or the car

1203
01:13:13,450 --> 01:13:17,639
paint an accurate enough portrait

1204
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:22,119
of the fucking hell
that I have gone through for you.

1205
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:24,419
Oh, wait a minute.
You mean you did something

1206
01:13:24,420 --> 01:13:27,629
other than drive a limo
while dying slowly?

1207
01:13:27,630 --> 01:13:31,929
You went out and risked something,
you learned something. You felt something!

1208
01:13:31,930 --> 01:13:34,679
Is that what I did? For shame!

1209
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:38,280
You owe me an explanation, Roger,
at the very fucking least.

1210
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:44,209
All right.

1211
01:13:44,210 --> 01:13:46,709
The ledgers contain hard financials,

1212
01:13:46,710 --> 01:13:50,769
I.E., illegal activity of everyone
I've ever done business with.

1213
01:13:50,770 --> 01:13:55,539
And I've done business with
some bad guys that I am now selling out

1214
01:13:55,540 --> 01:13:57,159
to save myself.

1215
01:13:57,160 --> 01:14:00,329
- Laurent bought the ledgers?
- No, he's a blackmailer.

1216
01:14:00,330 --> 01:14:02,869
He paid 300K.
You could get 10 times that.

1217
01:14:02,870 --> 01:14:06,149
- So, then, why don't you hang onto them?
- I'm short selling them

1218
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:09,679
to purchase a very expensive plane ticket
out of here tonight,

1219
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:12,429
one which gets me somewhere
I cannot be extradited.

1220
01:14:12,430 --> 01:14:15,889
And the gentleman I'm buying the
flight from has a fleet of jets.

1221
01:14:15,890 --> 01:14:19,799
He's willing to run the risk,
provided he gets the ledgers.

1222
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:22,329
- What about Laurent?
- He's a fucking idiot.

1223
01:14:22,330 --> 01:14:26,059
And since I just got done explaining
to you that I did business with some
bad guys

1224
01:14:26,060 --> 01:14:29,309
- and then beat them,
that would make me...
- Worse.

1225
01:14:29,310 --> 01:14:30,909
Better!

1226
01:14:30,910 --> 01:14:35,829
Opposite of a fucking idiot food
chain, pal. So, fuck Laurent!

1227
01:14:35,830 --> 01:14:39,429
And your word, none of
which means bupkis to me.

1228
01:14:39,430 --> 01:14:43,760
What does is "finish line".

1229
01:14:53,770 --> 01:14:57,350
I'm gonna change.

1230
01:15:13,340 --> 01:15:15,600
Muscles.

1231
01:15:23,940 --> 01:15:25,039
Yeah?

1232
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:28,509
<i>You missed the fucking deadline, Kevin.
Where's my money?</i>

1233
01:15:28,510 --> 01:15:31,540
<i>Where's my money?</i>

1234
01:15:33,670 --> 01:15:37,650
Kite, on Ivar. Twenty minutes.

1235
01:16:05,230 --> 01:16:07,069
Stay close.

1236
01:16:07,070 --> 01:16:08,650
Okay.

1237
01:16:18,490 --> 01:16:19,890
Oh, no.

1238
01:16:20,770 --> 01:16:22,240
Hello, buddy!

1239
01:16:25,010 --> 01:16:28,810
Now, you are my victim, huh?

1240
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:33,730
Stretch, it looks like
our journey has come to an end.

1241
01:16:34,930 --> 01:16:37,919
- You've been a wonderful driver.
- What?

1242
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:39,919
Where are you going?

1243
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:43,410
And now, I'm going to fuck you up, dick!

1244
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:48,939
Chill, Drago.
Let him go.

1245
01:16:48,940 --> 01:16:53,159
He owes me six grand, so, before you
fuck him up, I need to collect.

1246
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:55,090
Trucha.

1247
01:16:56,430 --> 01:16:58,169
Mr. Karos!

1248
01:16:58,170 --> 01:16:59,809
Wait. Will you just...

1249
01:16:59,810 --> 01:17:01,499
I need to, uh, settle a bill.

1250
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:03,940
Would you mind letting me go there?

1251
01:17:06,730 --> 01:17:09,700
Have a rape party with them.

1252
01:17:11,030 --> 01:17:14,310
All that's left is the, the tip.

1253
01:17:14,700 --> 01:17:16,920
The gratuity.

1254
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:19,880
Let me know...

1255
01:17:42,190 --> 01:17:44,959
You were late getting back to me.

1256
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:46,010
No.

1257
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:50,690
And to quote you,
"Life is nothing but timing".

1258
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:56,970
Told you I was gonna steal that one.

1259
01:17:57,320 --> 01:18:01,580
Like I've stolen everything else before.

1260
01:18:02,220 --> 01:18:06,299
But that's not the reason you're
getting fucked, I was just having fun.

1261
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:11,710
Truth is, you were always gonna
get fucked, pal, because you are
a beta male!

1262
01:18:12,740 --> 01:18:17,609
And I grind guys like you
down to make my bread.

1263
01:18:17,610 --> 01:18:21,609
Promise of six grand
was all it took to fit you for strings.

1264
01:18:21,610 --> 01:18:26,700
Now, who but an absolute asshole
would bank on a $6,000 tip?

1265
01:18:27,890 --> 01:18:30,239
Sound familiar?

1266
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:33,360
I said that first.

1267
01:18:36,430 --> 01:18:38,960
Take comfort in this.

1268
01:18:39,290 --> 01:18:42,230
You got beat by the best.

1269
01:18:42,890 --> 01:18:47,629
By a bona fide, true, blue-blooded

1270
01:18:47,630 --> 01:18:49,630
bad guy.

1271
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:53,999
I eat, sleep, fuck, earn,

1272
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,290
ergo, I survive.

1273
01:18:57,420 --> 01:19:00,559
And when this whole marble
has finally melted down

1274
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:06,100
and the roaches are running what remains,
I will be crowned their king!

1275
01:19:10,420 --> 01:19:14,330
Because I am a fire starter, Stretch.

1276
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:18,740
And you are

1277
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:21,180
not!

1278
01:19:31,990 --> 01:19:33,680
<i>Cops.</i>

1279
01:19:33,870 --> 01:19:36,239
<i>Drop the fucking gun!</i>

1280
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:38,110
<i>Feds.</i>

1281
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:40,569
<i>That's Karos.</i>

1282
01:19:40,570 --> 01:19:41,930
<i>Fuck.</i>

1283
01:19:42,130 --> 01:19:44,219
<i>You're a fucking fed?</i>

1284
01:19:44,220 --> 01:19:46,129
<i>That's right, I'm a fucking fed, asshole!</i>

1285
01:19:46,130 --> 01:19:47,579
<i>Drop the briefcase, turn around,</i>

1286
01:19:47,580 --> 01:19:49,069
<i>put your hands on your head.
How about that?</i>

1287
01:19:49,070 --> 01:19:50,539
<i>Stretch, you're going to jail.</i>

1288
01:19:50,540 --> 01:19:51,399
<i>Do it!</i>

1289
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:54,559
<i>After all this?
After this fucking night?</i>

1290
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:59,779
<i>You lost, you let
a lying-piece-of-shit crook play you.</i>

1291
01:19:59,780 --> 01:20:02,619
<i>And now, you're going down with him.</i>

1292
01:20:02,620 --> 01:20:04,439
<i>Gun.</i>

1293
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:05,949
<i>Gun!</i>

1294
01:20:05,950 --> 01:20:08,960
<i>Holy shit! You have to do something.</i>

1295
01:20:10,570 --> 01:20:14,719
<i>Your whole life has led to this night,
this very moment.</i>

1296
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:16,360
<i>Do something.</i>

1297
01:20:16,650 --> 01:20:19,110
<i>You have got to do something.</i>

1298
01:20:20,470 --> 01:20:23,100
<i>Own the space.</i>

1299
01:20:23,650 --> 01:20:25,340
<i>Own it!</i>

1300
01:20:27,670 --> 01:20:30,419
<i>He couldn't have been more wrong about me.</i>

1301
01:20:30,420 --> 01:20:32,610
<i>I am a fire starter.</i>

1302
01:20:36,630 --> 01:20:39,510
And now we're on fire.

1303
01:20:45,740 --> 01:20:47,279
Iggy!

1304
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:50,000
Here's your six grand!

1305
01:21:09,350 --> 01:21:12,490
You're under arrest!
Get up! Get the fuck up!

1306
01:21:21,580 --> 01:21:25,030
You got balls, Stretch! Big balls!

1307
01:21:26,010 --> 01:21:27,620
Argh!

1308
01:21:36,090 --> 01:21:39,150
Yeah! That's more like it.

1309
01:22:42,580 --> 01:22:45,940
Hi, uh, coffee, please. Black.

1310
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:53,280
Sorry, babe.

1311
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:14,909
I knew you weren't French.

1312
01:23:14,910 --> 01:23:18,570
I'm about as French as you are LAPD.

1313
01:23:19,690 --> 01:23:21,299
Speaking of...

1314
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:23,339
Told you I'd get those ledgers for you.

1315
01:23:23,340 --> 01:23:27,379
Yeah, but what you didn't tell me is
you were gonna throw away my $300,000
to do it.

1316
01:23:27,380 --> 01:23:30,040
I thought Karos was gonna shoot.

1317
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:33,659
Somebody would've returned fire, then
somebody else might've gotten killed.

1318
01:23:33,660 --> 01:23:36,379
I didn't know Karos was
a, was an FBI target.

1319
01:23:36,380 --> 01:23:40,180
I thought he was just some rich flake
that I could make a big tip off of.

1320
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:47,289
I don't know how it sort
of snowballed on me.

1321
01:23:47,290 --> 01:23:50,430
Just one thing led to another and...

1322
01:23:51,620 --> 01:23:53,599
Look at me.

1323
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:56,009
It doesn't take much

1324
01:23:56,010 --> 01:23:59,000
to go from good to bad.

1325
01:23:59,660 --> 01:24:03,370
Smallest, dumbest little twist of fate
sometimes.

1326
01:24:03,630 --> 01:24:07,339
I didn't believe in that, "fate",
before last night.

1327
01:24:07,340 --> 01:24:11,670
My friend, everything happens
for a reason.

1328
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:14,459
Has to be that way.

1329
01:24:14,460 --> 01:24:16,939
It'd be too depressing otherwise.

1330
01:24:16,940 --> 01:24:19,460
So, am I going to jail then?

1331
01:24:19,900 --> 01:24:22,379
If you are, I'm not taking you.
You taking him?

1332
01:24:22,380 --> 01:24:24,159
- Nah.
- Nah.

1333
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:25,879
Karos is locked up, hopefully, for life.

1334
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:28,399
I'm gonna go home
and see if my wife still recognizes me.

1335
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:29,999
You're out of a job.

1336
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,479
You have warrants outstanding,
and you're probably gonna be the target

1337
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:35,980
of multiple lawsuits. So, I'd say
you're swimming in your fair share
of shit.

1338
01:24:37,690 --> 01:24:38,809
Pretty much.

1339
01:24:38,810 --> 01:24:40,719
You're on your own now, pal.

1340
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:42,370
Good luck.

1341
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:47,989
You should do it professionally.

1342
01:24:47,990 --> 01:24:49,239
What?

1343
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:51,789
Acting. You should do it professionally
'cause you're good, man.

1344
01:24:51,790 --> 01:24:54,679
I mean, you're really good. I totally
believed everything you were doing.

1345
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:56,179
- Really?
- Yeah!

1346
01:24:56,180 --> 01:24:57,249
Thank you.

1347
01:24:57,250 --> 01:25:02,130
If I'm you, next time I'm sitting
in a limo, I'm in the backseat.

1348
01:25:10,980 --> 01:25:13,850
Thank you.

1349
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:44,049
