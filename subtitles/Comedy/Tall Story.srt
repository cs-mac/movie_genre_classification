1
00:01:21,716 --> 00:01:24,211
- Not a single thing.
- What do we do?

2
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,236
Police line.
No one goes in or out!

3
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,637
But there are other entrances.

4
00:01:29,866 --> 00:01:32,306
Just make it look good.

5
00:02:05,551 --> 00:02:08,166
How are you, Mrs Denning?

6
00:02:11,356 --> 00:02:14,106
We haven't found them.

7
00:02:15,236 --> 00:02:18,051
Not him, nor the others.

8
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:20,962
Our town has been dead
for six years.

9
00:03:21,894 --> 00:03:25,029
At first we blamed
the closing of the mine.

10
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:27,469
The lack of jobs.

11
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:31,092
The lack of money.
The lack of everything.

12
00:03:31,422 --> 00:03:36,290
But then we had much worse to blame.
For something had come to Cold Rock.

13
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,563
Something bad that was
destroying our town even more.

14
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,800
That morning, nobody knew that
Cold Rock case was reaching its
conclusion.

15
00:03:46,002 --> 00:03:48,502
Don't drink out on the street, Rolly!

16
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,103
What street?

17
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,800
Julia!

18
00:04:30,116 --> 00:04:33,131
Julia, some help here, please!

19
00:04:35,255 --> 00:04:37,061
What happened?

20
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,662
I don't know. She started screaming
all of the sudden, out of nowhere.

21
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:42,906
- How long has she been like this?
- I don't know.

22
00:04:44,771 --> 00:04:47,686
- Oh my god!
- You didn't know?

23
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:51,075
I'm not equipped for this, Tracy.

24
00:04:51,676 --> 00:04:54,676
Push! Keep doing it.
Good, good.

25
00:04:55,117 --> 00:04:58,395
When the contraction comes again,
push where you feel my fingers.

26
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:02,165
Push where my fingers are. Down.
Push deep and down. Push!

27
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:05,566
- Push.
- I can't!

28
00:05:05,867 --> 00:05:08,967
You're doing it.
Keep doing it. Very good.

29
00:05:10,468 --> 00:05:12,468
Do it again.

30
00:05:14,769 --> 00:05:18,369
C'mon! Here it comes.
Good girl! That's it!

31
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:22,874
Okay.

32
00:05:23,104 --> 00:05:25,533
It's breech. Which means
the feet are coming first.

33
00:05:25,663 --> 00:05:28,778
But that's fine. I just need you
to push really hard.

34
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,079
- I can't.
- Really big push for me.

35
00:05:32,882 --> 00:05:35,522
Push! Push, Carol!

36
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:45,236
You did it! There it is!

37
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:47,706
You did it.

38
00:05:49,172 --> 00:05:51,742
Why is there no sound?

39
00:05:51,972 --> 00:05:55,945
- The baby is fine. It's good.
- Take her outta here.

40
00:05:56,672 --> 00:05:59,212
Good work, honey.
That is my girl!

41
00:05:59,513 --> 00:06:01,713
You did such a good job.
- But the baby..

42
00:06:01,842 --> 00:06:06,192
I know, honey. Julia is gonna take
very good care of her, I promise you.

43
00:06:06,593 --> 00:06:08,393
C'mon.

44
00:06:09,794 --> 00:06:12,645
Open your eyes. C'mon.

45
00:06:12,775 --> 00:06:15,800
Take a breath.
You can make it.

46
00:06:20,834 --> 00:06:23,784
C'mon, breathe.
C'mon now, breathe.

47
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:28,676
Breathe. Come on.

48
00:06:30,316 --> 00:06:32,671
Okay. Come on.

49
00:06:34,825 --> 00:06:37,375
Breathe. Breathe.

50
00:06:38,693 --> 00:06:41,708
You can do this.
C'mon, you can make it.

51
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:44,858
Open your eyes.

52
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:51,932
There you are!

53
00:06:52,633 --> 00:06:54,433
Hello.

54
00:07:09,305 --> 00:07:11,690
It's a big boy.

55
00:07:12,186 --> 00:07:14,506
No hospital, Julia.

56
00:07:14,736 --> 00:07:17,051
He needs monitoring, Tracy.

57
00:07:17,252 --> 00:07:19,552
No. No way.

58
00:07:32,001 --> 00:07:33,840
Steven.

59
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:37,485
That bastard never made a secret
of a fact that he likes my girls.

60
00:07:37,615 --> 00:07:40,380
He's always parading around
in front of them like a rooster.

61
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:44,147
Bare-chested and cocky
with those stupid cowboy boots.

62
00:07:44,377 --> 00:07:47,758
Always showing them things
and teaching them this and that.

63
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,359
And Carol falling for all of it.

64
00:07:50,688 --> 00:07:53,080
Did you realise?

65
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,886
No. God, no! If I had..

66
00:07:56,116 --> 00:07:59,373
..I would've shot him.
Bang, bang. Goodbye cowboy.

67
00:07:59,503 --> 00:08:01,828
Get rid of him.

68
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:07,809
This is nobody else's business,
Julia, but ours. No hospital.

69
00:08:08,664 --> 00:08:11,879
- They won't ask any questions.
- No, we won't go.

70
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:16,224
I won't put Carol through that shame.
She's not even nineteen.

71
00:08:17,922 --> 00:08:21,072
We take care of our own problems, okay?

72
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:28,636
In Cold Rock sometimes children
were born when they were not wanted.

73
00:08:29,469 --> 00:08:34,112
People just managed and they didn't
go hollering it from the rooftops.

74
00:08:34,342 --> 00:08:38,068
It may have been a bit sad,
but it was just good sense.

75
00:08:38,398 --> 00:08:42,662
Because a lot worse things were
happening when it came to the children.

76
00:08:43,692 --> 00:08:46,917
Wanted or not,
boys and girls,

77
00:08:47,147 --> 00:08:50,172
some of them just disappeared.

78
00:08:50,502 --> 00:08:54,716
Something had come to Cold Rock
that was taking the children.

79
00:08:54,947 --> 00:08:58,822
Something so menacing,
so terrifying..

80
00:08:59,852 --> 00:09:03,032
..that the people
finally gave it a name.

81
00:09:07,428 --> 00:09:09,738
She was in her room..

82
00:09:09,968 --> 00:09:13,197
..a few minutes earlier.
Then I came back and..

83
00:09:13,527 --> 00:09:17,007
..and she was gone.
She was just gone.

84
00:09:18,127 --> 00:09:21,142
There wasn't a sound.
There was no scream.

85
00:09:21,272 --> 00:09:24,412
There was nothing. I just..
looked outside & he was gone.

86
00:09:24,753 --> 00:09:27,868
- I just wish I have been there.
- I couldn't believe it.

87
00:09:27,998 --> 00:09:30,968
I looked up and down the street.
I couldn't see her anywhere.

88
00:09:31,098 --> 00:09:34,413
I panicked and all I could
think of was.. the Tall Man.

89
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,014
- I think he's the Devil.
- What kind of people
take people's kids?

90
00:09:38,143 --> 00:09:41,121
- Talking about the Tall Man?
- No, that's a myth.
There's no Tall Man.

91
00:09:41,251 --> 00:09:43,486
- He exists.
- The only Tall Man
that I've ever seen

92
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:45,603
is the one that kids built,
the scarecrow over there.

93
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,904
If this was a rich town, we'd have
the whole army looking for those kids.

94
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:52,895
I saw him two times.
Going into the forest at nighttime.

95
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:56,100
Right there, like he was
trying to avoid the bridge.

96
00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:00,545
It's such a big place. We've got
so many places for someone to hide.

97
00:11:15,856 --> 00:11:18,654
What are you talking about?
What else could it be?

98
00:11:18,784 --> 00:11:22,785
Of course it's a child molester.
A kind of asshole who hurts the kids.

99
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:26,419
- All I'm saying is that..
- What you say is bullshit, Chestnut.

100
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,269
It's not the Boogeyman, or the Devil,
or any of that old wives tale crap.

101
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,488
Tall Man my ass.
The guy's got a name,

102
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:35,689
and he'll shit himself like anyone
else when we drag him to the chair.

103
00:11:36,018 --> 00:11:38,980
You know about a lot of things,
don't you Douglas?

104
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,588
Give me another hit of that, Beth.

105
00:11:41,818 --> 00:11:46,086
I was sitting back there, listening to
you telling the sheriff your nice story.

106
00:11:46,316 --> 00:11:50,189
All I'm saying is you aren't here
to catch a ghost. Right?

107
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:52,164
Noted.

108
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,865
I was just making conversation.

109
00:11:55,486 --> 00:11:57,578
Cheers.

110
00:11:57,808 --> 00:11:59,608
Yeah.

111
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,049
Ladies, gents..

112
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:11,484
- Dark knight is back?
- Arrived this morning.

113
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:14,885
He's already on his fourth cup
of coffee. Short, black, no sugar.

114
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,954
Well, he's gotta sit up
all night in his car.

115
00:12:18,084 --> 00:12:20,096
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Julia.

116
00:12:20,226 --> 00:12:24,091
He'll start messing about, making his
bullshit rounds, and all that for what?

117
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,960
- You mean Dodd?
- I mean Sherlock Holmes.

118
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:30,175
Yeah, like clockwork. Last kid
disappeared two months ago.

119
00:12:30,305 --> 00:12:33,906
Won't be long before the next one goes.
Dodd's back on the trail.

120
00:12:34,136 --> 00:12:37,700
What difference will that make?
Eh, Julia? This town is already finished.

121
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,301
Yeah, I guess everyone
is feeling pretty down.

122
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:42,620
- Tell me about that.
- Mrs Johnson!

123
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,221
- She's gone.
- I haven't seen her in weeks.

124
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:48,578
Sweet Jesus! She looks
even worse than before.

125
00:12:48,908 --> 00:12:51,123
She wouldn't mind a cup of coffee.

126
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:54,324
She wouldn't mind
a winning lottery ticket.

127
00:13:05,539 --> 00:13:08,554
For you, Mrs Johnson. From Trish.

128
00:13:12,266 --> 00:13:16,483
Don't you want it?
I think it may do you some good.

129
00:13:25,803 --> 00:13:28,842
Wow. I know I might've
blacked out last night,

130
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:33,607
celebrating the birth of my baby boy,
but I know I didn't order up no nurse.

131
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,708
Good morning to you too, Steven.

132
00:13:37,015 --> 00:13:39,811
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Just picking up the pieces.

133
00:13:40,012 --> 00:13:42,612
Really? And who
do you think you are?

134
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,201
- I know who I am.
- What the fuck's that
supposed to mean?

135
00:13:46,431 --> 00:13:50,572
- I'm talking to you.
- What? You wanna hit me too?

136
00:13:50,802 --> 00:13:54,336
Stay out of our business.
I really care about Carol.

137
00:13:54,566 --> 00:13:57,452
I know. Like you care
about your bike.

138
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,407
I don't like your style.
May he rest in peace,

139
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,308
your husband left behind
some pretty big shoes to fill.

140
00:14:03,437 --> 00:14:05,977
After all, he was a doctor.
You're just a nurse.

141
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,132
Stick to changing diapers
and get off my back.

142
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:16,434
- Hey, Tracy.
- Hey. Come on in, take a seat.

143
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,742
Thanks. So, how is that sweet boy?

144
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,243
He's okay. Actually, I sent them
away to my sister's in Seattle.

145
00:14:23,472 --> 00:14:26,421
She's got a big house, and they
are close to everything, and..

146
00:14:26,551 --> 00:14:29,083
they're just kinda better off.

147
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,384
Carol's in no shape to travel, Tracy.

148
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:35,200
Yeah, but they made it there fine.
Julia, look, I still have to make a living.

149
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:38,945
I've got a job interview in Kaslo in 45
minutes. Good pay, good job, good tips.

150
00:14:39,075 --> 00:14:41,773
I can't be here all day to help Carol.
You gotta understand me.

151
00:14:41,903 --> 00:14:44,853
- Yeah, I get it.
- You know, I gotta hold on, Julia.

152
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,954
No, honestly, Tracy, I understand.

153
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:52,138
You want me to make you
some coffee or something?

154
00:14:52,339 --> 00:14:54,539
He's still here?

155
00:14:54,965 --> 00:14:59,436
Yeah. You gotta give me some time
with that, okay? It's not so simple.

156
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:04,266
He's kinda hard to handle. Trust me,
you just gotta let me handle this.

157
00:15:04,496 --> 00:15:06,766
What about Jenny?

158
00:15:14,177 --> 00:15:15,777
Hey.

159
00:15:17,978 --> 00:15:20,728
Your mom went to Kaslo.

160
00:15:36,498 --> 00:15:39,913
You haven't been doing your
speech therapy, have you?

161
00:15:49,507 --> 00:15:51,205
Okay.

162
00:15:51,435 --> 00:15:53,574
I'm here now.

163
00:15:53,804 --> 00:15:56,519
So.. speak.

164
00:16:05,163 --> 00:16:09,578
Why are you always hiding behind
all this hair? You're so pretty.

165
00:16:23,797 --> 00:16:26,547
So, you believe it too?

166
00:16:39,998 --> 00:16:42,912
He was like an ancient legend.

167
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:47,238
Something from a book
of fairy tales, or an old song.

168
00:16:48,551 --> 00:16:51,351
Everyone talked about
the Tall Man all the time

169
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,252
because everyone was afraid of him.

170
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:59,065
People were always afraid he'd
strike again. And when he did,

171
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:03,584
they thanked their lucky stars
he took someone else's kid.

172
00:17:03,914 --> 00:17:07,087
Maybe they felt a little
guilty thinking that way,

173
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,760
but that feeling didn't last long.

174
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,326
For everyone's got
their problems to deal with.

175
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,696
It's not just good or bad,
it's just the way it is.

176
00:17:55,164 --> 00:17:56,773
- Hey.
- Hi.

177
00:17:56,903 --> 00:17:59,343
- Done for today?
- Yeah.

178
00:17:59,473 --> 00:18:02,430
There's some more groceries
in the car. Is everything okay?

179
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,000
Yeah. He's been looking
forward to you getting home.

180
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,701
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

181
00:18:30,255 --> 00:18:31,925
Yes?

182
00:18:36,088 --> 00:18:39,653
Hey, sweetheart.
That's a beautiful song.

183
00:18:45,371 --> 00:18:48,414
Christine told me that
you missed me today.

184
00:18:48,844 --> 00:18:51,106
I missed you too.

185
00:18:51,336 --> 00:18:53,229
What did you do all day?

186
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,330
- We made a baking soda volcano.
- And you made it erupt?

187
00:18:56,459 --> 00:18:58,854
- Yeah.
- How did you do that?

188
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,791
We put baking soda and then we put
vinegar & then it exploded everywhere.

189
00:19:05,401 --> 00:19:09,740
Guess what we're having for
dinner tonight? Brussels sprouts!

190
00:19:23,587 --> 00:19:26,407
Hey guys, dinner's in half an hour!

191
00:19:27,427 --> 00:19:29,142
Okay!

192
00:19:32,657 --> 00:19:35,588
- Wow, what's that?
- That's a gorilla.

193
00:19:35,789 --> 00:19:39,789
- Where does he live?
- He lives in.. Australia.

194
00:19:39,977 --> 00:19:42,861
You think so? Maybe he can
live in a jungle somewhere.

195
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,462
This fish can live in our moat.
And he can patrol our waters,

196
00:19:46,591 --> 00:19:49,641
so that no one can come by,
and he'll eat everybody.

197
00:19:50,035 --> 00:19:52,420
- Bomb!
- Bomb!

198
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:56,045
Do the number trick.
I taught him a number trick.

199
00:19:56,175 --> 00:19:58,123
- Think of a number.
- Okay.

200
00:19:58,253 --> 00:20:00,509
- Double it.
- Wait, that's too fast.

201
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,790
Okay, think of a number.

202
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:06,511
- Double it. Add on six.
- Okay.

203
00:20:07,117 --> 00:20:09,670
Half it and when
it's cut in the half,

204
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,823
take away the first number you
thought of, & your answer is 3.

205
00:20:13,953 --> 00:20:16,331
I know! I know!

206
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,901
Works every time!

207
00:20:20,371 --> 00:20:22,641
Okay, buddy.

208
00:20:24,042 --> 00:20:26,242
There you go.

209
00:20:26,448 --> 00:20:28,932
Do you still have to
go to work tomorrow?

210
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:32,354
Yeah. But I'll try
not to finish too late.

211
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,655
Can we play together again
when you get home?

212
00:20:35,784 --> 00:20:37,994
I promise.

213
00:20:45,606 --> 00:20:47,901
Good night, David.

214
00:20:48,659 --> 00:20:50,707
What did you guys do today?

215
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,208
It's not what we did,
it's what he asked.

216
00:20:53,337 --> 00:20:56,425
- What did he ask?
- Brought up a T word.

217
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:59,589
- Television.
- What did you say?

218
00:20:59,719 --> 00:21:02,242
I said it was an evil
brainwashing tool

219
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,843
used by big corporations
to corrupt the peoples.

220
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,780
- Come on!
- Thanks.

221
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,370
He did ask me to buy one
to watch cartoons.

222
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,771
And how did you respond?

223
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:15,301
- I chose to ignore the question.
- Right. Of course.

224
00:21:15,831 --> 00:21:18,040
I saw Tracy today.

225
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:21,370
- The baby?
- Shipped off to Seattle.

226
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:23,271
Typical.

227
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:29,121
I saw Steven too. He informed me how
shitty I was compared to my husband.

228
00:21:29,322 --> 00:21:31,022
Yeah, figures.

229
00:21:31,151 --> 00:21:35,500
It's just weird. They just feel like
they own a part of him or something.

230
00:21:35,656 --> 00:21:39,489
That's what he meant to this town,
right? He.. helped them.

231
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,111
- He tried.
- He was a freaking saint.

232
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,919
I'm just tired talking about it.

233
00:21:46,149 --> 00:21:49,144
I know I bring it up
all the time. I'm sorry.

234
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:54,110
- Ta-da!
- Oh, dear Lord.

235
00:21:54,845 --> 00:21:57,375
You know you love it.

236
00:21:57,954 --> 00:22:00,624
I don't know. I don't..

237
00:22:01,423 --> 00:22:04,293
- How much? Tell me when.
- Just a.. when.

238
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:07,020
This is gonna give me
such a headache.

239
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,221
Just drink it.
It'll make it go away.

240
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:12,312
I don't think I can drink that.
This really..

241
00:22:18,415 --> 00:22:21,730
I'm okay. I know I am.

242
00:22:24,642 --> 00:22:27,443
All right, you little devil.

243
00:22:27,773 --> 00:22:29,973
Where are you?

244
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:14,535
All we have sinned and
falling short of the glory of God!

245
00:23:14,665 --> 00:23:20,252
We're damned! We're all going to Hell.
There's nothing you can do.

246
00:23:20,382 --> 00:23:25,697
The only salvation that is possible
for you is the blood of the Lamb..

247
00:23:25,929 --> 00:23:27,933
Christine?

248
00:23:28,963 --> 00:23:34,183
Last week I was sitting
on a plane from Memphis to Orlando.

249
00:23:34,313 --> 00:23:37,519
A gentleman was sitting
next to me, a very kind man.

250
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:42,649
He looked at me and he said:
"Pastor, I do good works."

251
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:47,264
"I take care of my family.
I look after my friends."

252
00:23:47,494 --> 00:23:50,609
I looked him square in the eye
and said: "That's marvelous!"

253
00:23:50,739 --> 00:23:53,957
"Tell the Devil about it,
cause you're going to Hell!"

254
00:24:31,228 --> 00:24:33,877
Oh my God! Christine!

255
00:24:37,306 --> 00:24:40,001
Tell me. Tell me.

256
00:24:57,709 --> 00:25:00,159
David? David?

257
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:05,099
David?

258
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:08,685
David!

259
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:12,732
David?

260
00:25:19,873 --> 00:25:21,888
Okay.

261
00:25:25,686 --> 00:25:28,236
Tell me. Tell me.

262
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:54,832
David!

263
00:26:02,537 --> 00:26:04,552
David!

264
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:40,380
Stop!

265
00:27:21,405 --> 00:27:23,545
David! David!

266
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:27,691
..difficulties we find here
is the lack of resolution.

267
00:29:27,921 --> 00:29:31,766
A child goes missing without
a trace. There's no closure.

268
00:29:31,896 --> 00:29:35,085
It's so frustrating.
You would think that..

269
00:34:01,922 --> 00:34:04,237
David!

270
00:34:24,138 --> 00:34:26,453
David!

271
00:37:55,308 --> 00:37:57,378
Mrs Denning?

272
00:38:01,136 --> 00:38:02,851
Shit!

273
00:38:03,181 --> 00:38:05,376
Mrs Denning?

274
00:38:07,517 --> 00:38:10,032
Here, let me help you.

275
00:38:10,673 --> 00:38:13,188
Okay. Can you stand?

276
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:21,455
Lieutenant, request received.
Central is sending reinforcement.

277
00:38:21,585 --> 00:38:24,102
Two cars. They're
leaving Seattle right now.

278
00:38:24,232 --> 00:38:27,847
ETA two hours.
Repeat, ETA two hours.

279
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:34,892
Dodd, I'm on my way.
I'm on the highway already.

280
00:38:36,025 --> 00:38:39,135
That was the guy
we're looking for, right?

281
00:38:39,367 --> 00:38:42,582
I'm on my way too, lieutenant.
Going as fast as I can.

282
00:38:45,646 --> 00:38:48,666
We're gonna get that son of a bitch.

283
00:39:11,711 --> 00:39:14,951
Come on. You are gonna be okay.

284
00:39:17,185 --> 00:39:19,722
You're gonna be just fine.

285
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,552
Damn!

286
00:39:26,383 --> 00:39:29,187
- We've got an emergency here.
- Oh my God!

287
00:39:29,317 --> 00:39:32,092
Julia! What happened to you?

288
00:39:32,222 --> 00:39:36,292
I found her on a road. Asshole
who did this is still out there.

289
00:39:38,155 --> 00:39:40,330
You want me to go with you?

290
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:43,731
No, you stay here. Get an ambulance.
Take care of her.

291
00:39:44,008 --> 00:39:46,323
Are you sure?

292
00:39:46,857 --> 00:39:49,472
Everything will be alright.

293
00:39:58,632 --> 00:40:01,551
Hey! Give it a rest.

294
00:40:02,647 --> 00:40:05,217
Give us some space.

295
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:10,565
- You're hurt, sweety.
- What happened, Julia?

296
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:20,265
It's okay.

297
00:40:22,047 --> 00:40:24,062
It's okay.

298
00:40:25,164 --> 00:40:29,379
Now, you wait right here.
I'll be right back.

299
00:41:04,343 --> 00:41:06,633
Go get cleaned up.

300
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:10,184
I left a towel and some
clean clothes in my office.

301
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:14,429
And when you're done, maybe
you can tell me what's going on.

302
00:41:18,148 --> 00:41:20,163
Thank you.

303
00:41:50,518 --> 00:41:52,765
I don't know what to say.

304
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:55,998
Be careful, sheriff.
Think about your pension.

305
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:58,599
How far are you away from
retirement? Eight months?

306
00:41:58,728 --> 00:42:00,810
We gotta warn
the department of Pittsville.

307
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:02,411
Yeah, they're armed
with two white rabbits.

308
00:42:02,541 --> 00:42:05,317
- Wasn't supposed to happen like this.
- That's why you have to go to the mine.

309
00:42:05,447 --> 00:42:07,914
- I wanna know what she's up to.
- Jesus Christ!

310
00:42:08,044 --> 00:42:11,023
- We're on the same boat, brother.
- Don't 'brother' me, you prick!

311
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:13,188
I have to think.
Let me think!

312
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:15,589
Yeah, you do that.

313
00:43:28,031 --> 00:43:30,646
She's looking at the kid's picture.

314
00:43:31,059 --> 00:43:33,279
She suspects something,
I can tell you.

315
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:35,480
What do we do?

316
00:43:35,881 --> 00:43:39,281
- I'll go get her.
- Don't move.

317
00:43:41,009 --> 00:43:43,224
Take a seat.

318
00:44:19,755 --> 00:44:21,575
Shit!

319
00:44:23,055 --> 00:44:26,339
She's left.
That bitch is in the forest!

320
00:44:29,455 --> 00:44:32,395
Grab what you need
out of your trucks.

321
00:44:32,965 --> 00:44:36,409
Steven, I need you to take that
group, take them into the forest.

322
00:44:36,539 --> 00:44:39,410
You find her, you bring her to me.
- I'll find her.

323
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:43,757
Don't do anything stupid. You find her,
you hang onto her. Then leave it to me.

324
00:44:51,132 --> 00:44:53,951
You still need to think, big boy?

325
00:44:54,463 --> 00:44:56,861
C'mon, all of us! Let's go!

326
00:44:57,091 --> 00:45:00,361
She's not gonna go far.
We'll stop her now!

327
00:45:11,729 --> 00:45:13,977
Sheriff, this is Campbell.

328
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:16,678
We just received the call
from central in Seattle.

329
00:45:16,907 --> 00:45:19,201
They're sending reinforcement.

330
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:23,402
It sounds like Dodd is chasing
our guy. Are you hearing this?

331
00:45:40,518 --> 00:45:42,919
Do you copy, sheriff?

332
00:45:43,149 --> 00:45:45,155
Yeah, yeah, I'm copying.

333
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:47,944
Asshole. How am I even
supposed to do this job?

334
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,845
I've got two lousy cars,
I've got a useless deputy.

335
00:46:34,247 --> 00:46:37,775
No, no, she's not caught.
She's hiding in the forest.

336
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:41,345
They'll get her.
You stay put. I'll call you.

337
00:50:02,984 --> 00:50:04,799
David?

338
00:51:00,401 --> 00:51:02,216
Mommy!

339
00:51:04,807 --> 00:51:07,175
It's all over, angel.

340
00:51:07,305 --> 00:51:09,582
Everything's okay.

341
00:51:09,712 --> 00:51:12,227
She scares me.

342
00:51:13,009 --> 00:51:16,424
It's all over, baby.
It's all over.

343
00:51:57,977 --> 00:52:01,125
It took me an hour
to calm him down.

344
00:52:01,555 --> 00:52:04,681
Just to get him to recognize me.

345
00:52:04,911 --> 00:52:09,341
Do you know how a mother feels
when her child does not recognize her?

346
00:52:10,366 --> 00:52:14,883
He'd been brainwashed.
You told him I was gone.

347
00:52:16,827 --> 00:52:19,737
What the fuck are you up to?

348
00:52:24,749 --> 00:52:26,783
Last night,

349
00:52:26,913 --> 00:52:29,469
like almost every night,

350
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:33,781
I went into the woods to try
to find the bastard who took my son.

351
00:52:34,411 --> 00:52:36,333
Tall Man.

352
00:52:36,463 --> 00:52:40,184
Old lady Ashcroft said
she'd seen him twice at nightfall.

353
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:42,442
So I walked.

354
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:44,659
I walked.

355
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,210
And I walked.

356
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:50,935
And then by chance
I came to your house.

357
00:52:54,318 --> 00:52:57,513
Chance or intuition,
call it what you like.

358
00:53:00,763 --> 00:53:02,984
And he was there.

359
00:53:03,214 --> 00:53:06,281
I couldn't believe it,
but he was there.

360
00:53:06,611 --> 00:53:09,673
I went round and around
and around in my head,

361
00:53:09,903 --> 00:53:12,513
trying to make sense of it.

362
00:53:12,843 --> 00:53:15,268
Did I dream that?

363
00:53:16,603 --> 00:53:19,217
My mind turned to Trish.

364
00:53:20,047 --> 00:53:23,629
She made an altar for him,
like she did for all the others.

365
00:53:23,859 --> 00:53:27,141
Four candles and prayers
for his return.

366
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:30,386
When you talk to Trish, she listens.

367
00:53:31,601 --> 00:53:34,596
She never saw me as a freak.

368
00:53:38,001 --> 00:53:41,096
She wasn't the first one I saw.

369
00:53:42,235 --> 00:53:46,451
When I looked into your eyes,
I knew I wasn't mad.

370
00:53:48,355 --> 00:53:50,875
It wasn't enough for you
to see me like that.

371
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:53,576
You had to offer me
your God damn coffee.

372
00:53:53,805 --> 00:53:57,347
It's your innocent air
and your angel face, right?

373
00:53:57,577 --> 00:54:01,183
Were you worried?
Did you feel guilty?

374
00:54:01,813 --> 00:54:05,284
Or are you just the most cynical
bitch the world has ever seen

375
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:09,059
that you offer a coffee to a woman
whose child you kidnapped.

376
00:54:12,514 --> 00:54:17,118
I waited for you to leave.
I waited for the diner to empty.

377
00:54:18,029 --> 00:54:20,501
At first Trish didn't believe me.

378
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:23,631
People around here
all trust you, Julia Denning.

379
00:54:23,790 --> 00:54:26,545
But I talked and I talked,

380
00:54:26,775 --> 00:54:29,907
and I talked, until she
started to have doubts.

381
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:32,460
And when they were big enough,

382
00:54:32,590 --> 00:54:35,607
just big enough, I told her
I was gonna get my kid back.

383
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,408
And she said "You're gonna
break into Julia's house?"

384
00:54:38,537 --> 00:54:42,554
and I said "If he's not there, you can
drive me to the loony bin yourself."

385
00:54:42,784 --> 00:54:45,632
She decided to keep
the diner open all night.

386
00:54:45,862 --> 00:54:49,301
Waiting up for my news with
some of the other regulars.

387
00:54:49,531 --> 00:54:52,526
But it's not me they saw arriving.

388
00:54:56,704 --> 00:54:59,244
When I saw you
at the window with my son,

389
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:02,845
I thought about calling the cops.
But I don't trust them.

390
00:55:03,304 --> 00:55:07,755
All they've ever done for me is kick me
out of my house. They don't care.

391
00:55:08,784 --> 00:55:12,199
Look where they forced me
to live with my son!

392
00:55:13,948 --> 00:55:17,763
You took my baby away.
And the other children too.

393
00:55:19,159 --> 00:55:22,374
Where are they?
Where are the other kids?

394
00:55:23,414 --> 00:55:27,053
Julia, you tell me what you've
done with the other children,

395
00:55:27,183 --> 00:55:29,698
or I swear you'll die.

396
00:55:31,136 --> 00:55:33,986
I gave them to the Tall Man.

397
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:37,573
Who is he?

398
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:40,034
Don't you know?

399
00:55:40,564 --> 00:55:43,529
The whole town is talking about him.

400
00:55:46,095 --> 00:55:49,545
Don't mess with me, Julia.
Who is he?

401
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:54,505
He is the one
everyone's talking about.

402
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:07,050
Mommy?

403
00:56:12,227 --> 00:56:14,677
Come here, angel.

404
00:56:16,743 --> 00:56:19,613
She won't hurt you anymore.

405
00:56:20,587 --> 00:56:24,255
Look at my son, Julia,
and tell him you lied.

406
00:56:24,585 --> 00:56:28,645
Tell him you're nothing to him.
He has to hear it from you.

407
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:09,319
David!

408
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:28,895
David!

409
00:58:40,978 --> 00:58:42,578
No!

410
00:58:45,979 --> 00:58:48,104
Let go! No!

411
00:59:08,925 --> 00:59:11,595
Where did you learn
how to do that?

412
00:59:21,296 --> 00:59:24,096
This evening police scanners
are very busy indeed.

413
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:26,597
We have noticed
a lot of increased traffic.

414
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:29,798
FBI presence in town, and our
news reporter Amy Wilkinson..

415
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:34,999
- ..can you hear me?
- Yes David, hello, hi.

416
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:39,600
Yes, it seems that things are
finally starting to happen here..

417
00:59:54,513 --> 00:59:56,680
Thank God, you did it!

418
00:59:56,820 --> 00:59:59,881
- He's never going back there.
- What happened?

419
01:00:00,110 --> 01:00:04,067
We don't have any time.
The whole town will be here soon.

420
01:00:05,231 --> 01:00:07,511
It's over.

421
01:00:16,658 --> 01:00:18,760
Go home, Jenny.

422
01:00:18,927 --> 01:00:22,122
Just go home and don't say
anything to anyone.

423
01:00:47,675 --> 01:00:50,953
Remember that number trick
that you showed us at dinner?

424
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:53,814
You take a number,
multiply it by something,

425
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:57,115
add six, and the result
is always three?

426
01:01:01,566 --> 01:01:04,401
You don't know what
you're talking about.

427
01:01:04,831 --> 01:01:07,152
It's a really good trick.
It always works.

428
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:10,253
I just don't remember what
you did? Want us to go again?

429
01:01:20,766 --> 01:01:24,726
Please don't ask me to do that.
You couldn't bear it, believe me.

430
01:01:28,346 --> 01:01:31,166
Remember eating
the brussels sprouts?

431
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:34,119
Doesn't matter what
number you take..

432
01:01:36,677 --> 01:01:39,202
It's always three.

433
01:01:43,444 --> 01:01:47,536
Jenny knows. She knows.
She's been watching me for weeks.

434
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:51,200
- That's impossible.
- We got comfortable.

435
01:01:51,361 --> 01:01:54,771
- We got sloppy.
- How much does she know?

436
01:01:55,101 --> 01:01:57,721
She wants to see him.

437
01:02:01,232 --> 01:02:04,089
You take him down and we go.

438
01:02:23,253 --> 01:02:26,276
You do it and we leave, right?

439
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:33,970
Tell me you're not gonna stay here.

440
01:02:36,581 --> 01:02:38,196
No!

441
01:03:34,673 --> 01:03:37,488
Of course you're still here.

442
01:03:41,054 --> 01:03:44,804
I gave him your name, where
you live. Perhaps he'll come.

443
01:03:49,638 --> 01:03:52,308
But if you say anything,
Jenny, he'll come for sure.

444
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:55,309
But not in a way that you want.

445
01:03:57,169 --> 01:04:01,064
Cause he'll do things to you
that you can't even imagine.

446
01:04:04,949 --> 01:04:07,144
Get outta here.

447
01:04:58,574 --> 01:05:01,517
Julia! Bitch, open up!

448
01:05:01,747 --> 01:05:05,311
- Shut up and let me do the talking.
- Julia, open the goddamned door!

449
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:08,212
You're not gonna break through.
The cops are coming.

450
01:05:08,375 --> 01:05:10,245
You're dead, bitch!

451
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:14,046
The cops are coming. They'll be
dealing with her, do you understand?

452
01:05:15,047 --> 01:05:18,047
Okay? Everything's gonna be fine.

453
01:07:43,876 --> 01:07:45,416
Are you alright?

454
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:47,917
For God's sake, Campbell, I told you
to keep her away from the window.

455
01:07:48,060 --> 01:07:50,118
- Sorry, sheriff.
- Keep her away from the damn window.

456
01:07:50,246 --> 01:07:53,066
They wanna tear her apart.
C'mon. Let's go.

457
01:07:53,396 --> 01:07:57,275
- Lieutenant, there's too many.
- We're not waiting.

458
01:07:58,250 --> 01:08:02,050
Just keep your looks straight ahead.
Deputy, you're on the right.

459
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:05,876
When we get out of that door,
I want you to head straight for the..

460
01:08:10,180 --> 01:08:12,930
Shit! Come on, let's go.

461
01:08:14,158 --> 01:08:17,133
Keep your head down.
Look at the ground in front of you.

462
01:08:17,263 --> 01:08:20,317
Do not engage. We're
headed straight for the car.

463
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:22,662
Don't say a word.
Don't talk back.

464
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:25,063
Look straight down.
Now, let's go!

465
01:08:25,710 --> 01:08:27,940
You're gonna die!

466
01:08:31,741 --> 01:08:34,141
Where's my baby?

467
01:08:37,884 --> 01:08:40,084
Okay, go, go!

468
01:08:40,785 --> 01:08:43,225
Where's my baby?

469
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:46,635
Let's go! Go! Go!

470
01:09:06,769 --> 01:09:09,619
Keep your head down,
Mrs Denning. Down!

471
01:09:41,025 --> 01:09:43,741
Nice little workshop.

472
01:09:49,377 --> 01:09:50,992
Hey.

473
01:10:04,395 --> 01:10:06,035
Shit.

474
01:10:06,167 --> 01:10:08,207
Oh mercy!

475
01:10:13,390 --> 01:10:17,047
Did you know this house
was built over this shaft?

476
01:10:17,177 --> 01:10:21,144
There are holes everywhere here.
More than 40 square miles of them.

477
01:10:21,474 --> 01:10:25,478
It's gonna be a pain in the ass.
- Bad for us, Chestnut.

478
01:10:25,808 --> 01:10:29,623
The whole region is sitting
on the same swiss cheese.

479
01:10:32,380 --> 01:10:35,387
If the children are down here.

480
01:10:35,517 --> 01:10:40,298
It'll take us a 100 men and 20 years
to find them if they're down here.

481
01:10:40,728 --> 01:10:45,143
And who's to say she didn't use this
as a passageway out into the woods?

482
01:10:46,692 --> 01:10:48,262
No.

483
01:10:48,592 --> 01:10:53,007
Gonna need everybody. Get them
outside. Gonna need lights.

484
01:11:15,522 --> 01:11:17,893
- Not a single thing.
- What do we do?

485
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:21,038
Police line.
No one goes in or out!

486
01:11:49,843 --> 01:11:52,458
How are you, Mrs Denning?

487
01:11:55,002 --> 01:11:57,472
We haven't found them.

488
01:11:57,603 --> 01:12:00,358
Not him, nor the others.

489
01:12:04,318 --> 01:12:06,833
Don't tell me..

490
01:12:07,834 --> 01:12:11,677
Don't tell me that's what
I have to tell the parents.

491
01:12:24,365 --> 01:12:26,620
Keep going.

492
01:12:31,615 --> 01:12:35,610
Now, I'm getting to understand
that your husband

493
01:12:35,780 --> 01:12:39,655
was a well respected man
around here, Mrs Denning.

494
01:12:41,512 --> 01:12:43,827
Yes, he was.

495
01:12:44,742 --> 01:12:49,362
And there was a large age difference
between you, isn't that right?

496
01:12:54,136 --> 01:12:55,751
Yes.

497
01:12:57,547 --> 01:13:02,601
He was a doctor in Cold Rock
from 1992. until when?

498
01:13:07,930 --> 01:13:10,200
Until the end.

499
01:13:12,729 --> 01:13:14,969
His end.

500
01:13:17,329 --> 01:13:21,524
How would you describe his relationship
to the people around here?

501
01:13:22,915 --> 01:13:25,830
He kept this community together.

502
01:13:27,228 --> 01:13:30,163
Cold Rock was dignified then.

503
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:35,415
He helped to create that dignity.

504
01:13:37,236 --> 01:13:38,851
Yes.

505
01:13:39,963 --> 01:13:42,878
And then the mine shut down.

506
01:13:43,549 --> 01:13:46,324
And moral declined.

507
01:13:47,487 --> 01:13:51,502
And he was gone when the children
were paying the price.

508
01:13:52,165 --> 01:13:54,235
The children?

509
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:57,436
They were suffering so much.

510
01:13:58,421 --> 01:14:01,290
I had to do something.

511
01:14:01,622 --> 01:14:05,037
Could you explain that for me,
Mrs Denning?

512
01:14:06,753 --> 01:14:10,603
Did you keep them in that room,
one after the other?

513
01:14:12,823 --> 01:14:16,238
In a real children's room,
with books.

514
01:14:17,026 --> 01:14:21,066
And toys, and music.
It's filled with beautiful things.

515
01:14:23,829 --> 01:14:28,511
And Christine? She looked after
the children when you were away?

516
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:34,019
Yes.

517
01:14:34,649 --> 01:14:37,589
Apparently, you told David's mother

518
01:14:37,740 --> 01:14:42,164
that you delivered the children
to someone you called 'the Tall Man'.

519
01:14:43,945 --> 01:14:47,160
The whole of Cold Rock
chose that name.

520
01:14:47,780 --> 01:14:50,780
Mrs Denning, is there a man,
whatever his name,

521
01:14:50,910 --> 01:14:53,865
to whom you delivered the children?

522
01:14:59,408 --> 01:15:01,123
No.

523
01:15:02,505 --> 01:15:05,081
You acted alone?

524
01:15:05,211 --> 01:15:06,951
Yes.

525
01:15:09,549 --> 01:15:12,166
You yourself, Mrs Denning,

526
01:15:12,296 --> 01:15:15,545
you were never able
to bear children, were you?

527
01:15:17,971 --> 01:15:20,886
We couldn't have children.

528
01:15:28,198 --> 01:15:33,882
Mrs Denning, did you kidnap
the children of Pittsville county?

529
01:15:41,845 --> 01:15:43,547
Yes.

530
01:15:43,777 --> 01:15:47,202
Did you make those
children disappear?

531
01:15:51,513 --> 01:15:55,328
Mrs Denning,
are those children dead?

532
01:16:01,754 --> 01:16:04,469
Did you kill them?

533
01:16:08,384 --> 01:16:11,334
Did you kill them, Mrs Denning?

534
01:16:16,181 --> 01:16:18,651
Mrs Denning?

535
01:16:29,572 --> 01:16:32,057
Cold Rock, USA,

536
01:16:32,187 --> 01:16:34,491
Pittsville county,

537
01:16:34,621 --> 01:16:37,471
Washington State,

538
01:16:37,701 --> 01:16:39,961
shut down mine,

539
01:16:40,091 --> 01:16:42,060
no school,

540
01:16:42,190 --> 01:16:45,861
miles of forest and
a labyrinth of tunnels.

541
01:16:46,191 --> 01:16:50,876
Possibly the worst place ever to search
for traces of 18 missing children.

542
01:16:51,806 --> 01:16:54,426
Last victim's name,

543
01:16:54,656 --> 01:16:57,471
David Johnson.

544
01:17:34,933 --> 01:17:38,092
How are you managing, Mrs Johnson?

545
01:17:38,322 --> 01:17:40,762
- I'm holding on.
- Good.

546
01:17:40,992 --> 01:17:43,540
Okay, you wanna come in?

547
01:17:43,670 --> 01:17:45,987
Have a seat.

548
01:17:46,217 --> 01:17:49,457
We need you to avoid confrontation.

549
01:17:50,336 --> 01:17:54,476
We need you to appeal to her
as a mother. Do you understand?

550
01:17:55,237 --> 01:17:57,296
I understand.

551
01:17:57,526 --> 01:18:01,986
If any single remark or question
shuts her down, we get nothing.

552
01:18:02,316 --> 01:18:07,131
We have found no trace of the kids,
and she doesn't talk to us anymore.

553
01:18:08,939 --> 01:18:13,231
Mrs Johnson,
if you feel that you cannot

554
01:18:13,380 --> 01:18:17,201
go through with this right now,
you need to let me know.

555
01:18:18,691 --> 01:18:21,031
No, I'm ready.

556
01:18:22,519 --> 01:18:25,229
You try not to focus
on anything too specific.

557
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:27,930
You just talk to her,
you listen to her.

558
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:30,659
You try to get her to open up.

559
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:34,084
If we get anything, it will be
because she didn't realise it.

560
01:18:34,220 --> 01:18:36,885
Do you understand?

561
01:19:35,956 --> 01:19:38,771
I know why you're here.

562
01:19:39,950 --> 01:19:42,590
You want answers.

563
01:19:42,941 --> 01:19:44,756
Yes.

564
01:19:46,519 --> 01:19:50,959
There's nothing I can say
that's gonna give you any comfort.

565
01:19:51,988 --> 01:19:53,958
Julia..

566
01:19:55,308 --> 01:19:58,058
I can't live.

567
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:01,973
I keep turning things
around in my mind.

568
01:20:02,103 --> 01:20:04,918
And I miss him, you know.

569
01:20:06,759 --> 01:20:10,018
It's unbearable, the missing him.

570
01:20:10,648 --> 01:20:14,698
Thinking about him all the time,
wondering where he is.

571
01:20:15,898 --> 01:20:17,900
I know.

572
01:20:18,078 --> 01:20:20,828
I don't think you do, Julia.

573
01:20:21,486 --> 01:20:23,931
But I do know.

574
01:20:24,061 --> 01:20:27,601
I was a mother to each
and every one of them.

575
01:20:28,617 --> 01:20:32,632
They had everything
they could ever possibly need.

576
01:20:35,828 --> 01:20:38,257
Julia, I know I live in a dump.

577
01:20:38,420 --> 01:20:40,837
I don't have a job
and life for me is hard,

578
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,838
but I would still die for him,
you know.

579
01:20:46,553 --> 01:20:49,503
It's the same everywhere.

580
01:20:52,131 --> 01:20:55,151
The defeat and the pain.

581
01:20:55,935 --> 01:20:58,215
It's a cycle.

582
01:20:58,951 --> 01:21:01,006
A cycle?

583
01:21:02,561 --> 01:21:05,511
You shouldn't have come here.

584
01:21:19,504 --> 01:21:21,899
What cycle?

585
01:21:25,579 --> 01:21:28,541
The system is broken.

586
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:31,221
It doesn't work.

587
01:21:32,134 --> 01:21:35,549
There's nowhere to turn,
there's no support.

588
01:21:36,543 --> 01:21:40,363
I've seen it all over the world.
It's just easier to give up.

589
01:21:41,996 --> 01:21:44,081
I'm not..

590
01:21:44,211 --> 01:21:48,382
any better than you, Mrs Johnson.
I've just seen more.

591
01:21:48,512 --> 01:21:52,091
It's not a matter of being a good
person or being a bad person,

592
01:21:52,260 --> 01:21:56,592
it's about how you cope.
We are so limited.

593
01:22:00,350 --> 01:22:05,146
But the eyes of every child
are filled with potential and hope,

594
01:22:05,276 --> 01:22:09,280
and we should embrace and nourish
that potential, but we don't.

595
01:22:09,420 --> 01:22:11,947
We continue to make
the same mistakes.

596
01:22:12,077 --> 01:22:15,102
We continue to let the children
grow up broken and lost,

597
01:22:15,260 --> 01:22:18,474
just like their parents.
We have to break the cycle.

598
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:21,340
It has to be the priority,
but it's not.

599
01:22:21,504 --> 01:22:24,849
That's what I've been trying to do.
That's what I've done everywhere.

600
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:28,454
And what did I change?
Nothing!

601
01:22:28,984 --> 01:22:32,046
Yes I cared, I helped, I cuddled.

602
01:22:32,176 --> 01:22:36,186
Thinking I was bringing change,
thinking I was making a difference.

603
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:39,831
But when we asked for real change,
all these bureaucrats said:

604
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,832
"No, you can't do that.
There's a process".

605
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:46,048
Every time you question
the politicians and the system

606
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:49,149
that makes poor people poor
and the children suffer,

607
01:22:49,300 --> 01:22:52,050
they said "no you can't
do that, there's a process",

608
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:55,451
so the cycle goes on
and goes on and goes on.

609
01:22:56,004 --> 01:22:59,404
And the children continue to suffer
and no one does anything about it,

610
01:22:59,534 --> 01:23:02,549
and the world will never change.

611
01:23:04,973 --> 01:23:07,823
God, I'm just torturing you.

612
01:23:18,037 --> 01:23:22,693
If you're done, can you answer
two simple questions?

613
01:23:26,045 --> 01:23:29,360
The parents of Cold Rock
need to know.

614
01:23:31,756 --> 01:23:34,606
Are the children dead?

615
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:45,635
No!

616
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:52,740
I couldn't keep them all.

617
01:23:55,663 --> 01:23:58,107
Where are they?

618
01:23:58,360 --> 01:24:00,852
In the forest.

619
01:24:01,539 --> 01:24:04,054
In the tunnels.

620
01:24:06,066 --> 01:24:08,081
Everywhere.

621
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:04,240
Baby killer!

622
01:25:09,541 --> 01:25:11,941
You're mine, bitch!

623
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:40,640
I'm not bringing her back!

624
01:25:42,841 --> 01:25:45,441
- No.
- What do you mean no?

625
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:50,665
I don't care what your fucking sister
said! Carol needs to come back!

626
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:53,175
Steven, bring your voice down.

627
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:55,676
I'm not gonna bring
my fucking voice down!

628
01:25:55,805 --> 01:25:58,680
You're drunk! We're gonna
talk about this tomorrow.

629
01:25:58,810 --> 01:26:00,680
No!

630
01:26:02,460 --> 01:26:06,358
It's your fault.
Carol needs to come back.

631
01:26:07,769 --> 01:26:10,764
Do you want me to hit you?

632
01:26:13,787 --> 01:26:17,202
Don't! Don't! Learn to
goddamn shut your mouth!

633
01:26:20,553 --> 01:26:22,948
Do you wanna get hit?

634
01:26:24,436 --> 01:26:26,451
Oh baby!

635
01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:31,358
Get off me, you little..

636
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:41,275
Son of a bitch!
Baby, come here.

637
01:26:54,831 --> 01:26:58,907
Don't you touch her.
Don't you ever touch her!

638
01:27:01,636 --> 01:27:04,651
You didn't miss me this time, honey.

639
01:27:05,652 --> 01:27:07,737
Nice shot.

640
01:27:08,613 --> 01:27:10,853
You bastard.

641
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:15,935
Jenny! Jenny, where are you, honey?

642
01:28:19,397 --> 01:28:23,012
Come back, baby.
It's okay! I'm okay!

643
01:33:00,720 --> 01:33:04,057
I'm probably not
what you were dreaming of,

644
01:33:04,187 --> 01:33:07,402
but you're not a baby
yourself, dear.

645
01:33:08,750 --> 01:33:11,770
Can you wait here for a moment?

646
01:33:19,552 --> 01:33:22,442
Yes, I think it will be alright.

647
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:27,664
It has to be. As far as we're
concerned, Jenny Weaver is dead.

648
01:33:28,152 --> 01:33:31,297
Please meet Vera Parker Leigh.

649
01:33:32,567 --> 01:33:34,640
Watch over carefully.

650
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:37,441
Our field officer wasn't able
to give her a proper transition.

651
01:33:37,580 --> 01:33:40,120
Be extremely careful
the first few weeks.

652
01:33:40,289 --> 01:33:44,104
Her behaviour can still become
suspicious and give us away.

653
01:33:49,047 --> 01:33:51,762
- No, ma'am.
- Please, I insist.

654
01:33:53,781 --> 01:33:56,796
I don't want your money.

655
01:33:59,276 --> 01:34:02,360
The women who saved this girl
paid a high price.

656
01:34:02,525 --> 01:34:04,522
One of them is dead,

657
01:34:04,652 --> 01:34:07,397
and the other will never
again see the light of day.

658
01:34:07,527 --> 01:34:10,175
I know. I saw her on the news.

659
01:34:10,305 --> 01:34:12,872
Your money is an insult
to their sacrifice.

660
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:15,672
Will Jenny be the last one
being taken care of?

661
01:34:15,858 --> 01:34:18,198
The last one from my division.

662
01:34:18,499 --> 01:34:20,899
Mrs Parker Leigh.

663
01:34:21,719 --> 01:34:24,634
So, there are more of you?

664
01:35:48,631 --> 01:35:50,986
How are you, Tracy?

665
01:35:51,496 --> 01:35:54,111
I wasn't expecting you.

666
01:35:57,090 --> 01:36:00,005
We haven't found Jenny yet.

667
01:36:01,557 --> 01:36:04,627
I guess Chestnut is doing
what he can, right?

668
01:36:05,604 --> 01:36:08,254
I put one of my men on the case.

669
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:10,355
Thanks.

670
01:36:11,252 --> 01:36:13,456
What about Julia?

671
01:36:13,686 --> 01:36:17,721
Well, the prosecution's asking for
the death penalty this afternoon,

672
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:20,996
but I don't think
they're gonna grant it.

673
01:36:22,203 --> 01:36:26,053
In case she decides to tell them
where the other kids are buried.

674
01:36:27,078 --> 01:36:30,203
We know that she's not
the one who took my Jenny.

675
01:36:30,340 --> 01:36:34,610
Your Jenny ran away.
And I'm gonna find her.

676
01:36:35,961 --> 01:36:37,776
Okay.

677
01:36:38,489 --> 01:36:41,276
Hang in there, Tracy.

678
01:36:41,420 --> 01:36:44,599
I have been doing that for 25 years.

679
01:36:44,729 --> 01:36:47,544
Yeah, I hear you.

680
01:37:15,999 --> 01:37:18,975
My first mother was a good woman.

681
01:37:19,105 --> 01:37:21,981
Hardworking, generous,

682
01:37:22,111 --> 01:37:24,193
affectionate.

683
01:37:24,423 --> 01:37:27,463
We talked, we shared,

684
01:37:27,592 --> 01:37:29,729
we laughed,

685
01:37:29,859 --> 01:37:31,991
but then it stopped.

686
01:37:32,121 --> 01:37:34,794
She couldn't talk to us anymore.

687
01:37:34,924 --> 01:37:38,234
About men,
about her dreams,

688
01:37:38,380 --> 01:37:40,600
about her pain.

689
01:37:40,772 --> 01:37:44,698
My first mother loved me,
and I loved my first mother.

690
01:37:47,422 --> 01:37:49,917
Watch your back!

691
01:37:52,485 --> 01:37:56,517
My second mother only
mothered me for a short time.

692
01:37:57,147 --> 01:37:59,932
I often think about her.

693
01:38:00,262 --> 01:38:03,929
I try to imagine the moment
she had in the tunnel,

694
01:38:04,159 --> 01:38:07,332
giving one last kid to her husband.

695
01:38:07,862 --> 01:38:11,037
Did he implore her
to run away with him?

696
01:38:11,267 --> 01:38:14,465
Or did they both know
someone had to stay.

697
01:38:14,695 --> 01:38:18,152
Be the monster,
pay the price,

698
01:38:18,382 --> 01:38:21,346
and protect their secret.

699
01:38:21,576 --> 01:38:25,771
Whether she was a good person
or not, I'm still not sure.

700
01:38:26,301 --> 01:38:30,916
But my second mother loved me,
and I loved my second mother.

701
01:38:37,917 --> 01:38:41,768
My third mother is teaching me
about the bigger world.

702
01:38:42,298 --> 01:38:45,940
She says knowledge is the key
to open all my doors.

703
01:38:46,100 --> 01:38:49,620
So I stay focused,
I observe,

704
01:38:49,950 --> 01:38:52,940
and I work hard.
- Vera, sweetheart!

705
01:38:53,100 --> 01:38:56,918
I listen to what she says,
I want to please her.

706
01:38:57,248 --> 01:39:01,327
My third mother loves me,
and I love my third mother.

707
01:39:01,580 --> 01:39:05,272
- You're gonna be late for art class.
- I'll be right there.

708
01:39:17,050 --> 01:39:19,870
My world has changed.

709
01:39:20,558 --> 01:39:23,412
I try to follow its rules.

710
01:39:23,642 --> 01:39:27,284
It's a beautiful world,
my new mother says.

711
01:39:27,914 --> 01:39:30,571
She tells me to hang on,

712
01:39:30,760 --> 01:39:33,374
that I'm doing well,

713
01:39:33,540 --> 01:39:36,699
that I'll get used to it with time.

714
01:39:40,519 --> 01:39:43,392
Jeffrey! Jeffrey!

715
01:39:43,622 --> 01:39:45,837
Come on.

716
01:39:47,075 --> 01:39:50,715
Come on, honey.
We're gonna be late.

717
01:39:52,173 --> 01:39:54,954
I'm not like the others.

718
01:39:55,200 --> 01:39:58,157
I guess they've forgotten.

719
01:39:59,187 --> 01:40:01,602
I can't.

720
01:40:07,045 --> 01:40:09,840
Every morning I wake up
to the same thought

721
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,741
of giving it all up
and running back home.

722
01:40:13,170 --> 01:40:16,763
But I remind myself
I wanted this life.

723
01:40:16,920 --> 01:40:20,168
I wanted it.
I made it happen.

724
01:40:22,115 --> 01:40:25,300
I guess it's better this way, right?

725
01:40:26,263 --> 01:40:28,279
Right?

726
01:40:29,445 --> 01:40:31,460
Right?

727
01:40:29,445 --> 01:40:31,460
