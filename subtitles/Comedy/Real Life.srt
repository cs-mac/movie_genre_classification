1
00:01:32,243 --> 00:01:35,111
Hello...
and welcome.

2
00:01:35,113 --> 00:01:38,180
I'm councilman Edmund Harris
of the fifth district.

3
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,555
I'm sure some of you know we're
gathered here this afternoon...

4
00:01:45,557 --> 00:01:48,591
To dedicate the beginning
of a year long project:

5
00:01:48,593 --> 00:01:53,362
To make a movie right here in
Phoenix and the outlying areas,

6
00:01:53,364 --> 00:01:55,965
and much of it in our own fifth district.

7
00:02:00,872 --> 00:02:04,073
The fifth district is the home of our
good friends, the yeager family:

8
00:02:04,075 --> 00:02:07,009
Warren, Jeanette,
cute little Lisa and Eric.

9
00:02:07,011 --> 00:02:10,646
And they're going to be
the stars of this unusual movie.

10
00:02:10,648 --> 00:02:13,182
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

11
00:02:13,184 --> 00:02:16,619
<i>All of us in this room are</i> going to have
an important part <i>in the picture too.</i>

12
00:02:17,855 --> 00:02:20,790
My wife tells me
I'm not handsome enough...

13
00:02:20,792 --> 00:02:22,792
To be in the movies.

14
00:02:22,794 --> 00:02:25,995
But our guest of honor
here today says that's baloney.

15
00:02:25,997 --> 00:02:28,264
<i>He's the gentleman</i>
behind the whole thing.

16
00:02:28,266 --> 00:02:30,266
<i>Quite a gentleman</i> he is.

17
00:02:30,268 --> 00:02:32,802
Why, he's made me laugh on...

18
00:02:36,808 --> 00:02:39,308
"The tonight show," the late ed Sullivan.

19
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:43,346
<i>And I know you've seen</i> his short films
on nbc's <i>"good night Saturday."</i>

20
00:02:43,348 --> 00:02:46,882
A lot of you have seen him on
your favorite shows, I'm sure.

21
00:02:46,884 --> 00:02:50,686
And if you like the food we had
today, you have him to thank.

22
00:02:50,688 --> 00:02:53,623
So would you please welcome
with a big Phoenix applause,

23
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:56,092
all the way from Hollywood, California,

24
00:02:56,094 --> 00:02:57,960
Mr. Albert Brooks!

25
00:03:07,305 --> 00:03:09,138
Thank you, councilman Harris.

26
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:13,643
Please tell the mayor
I wish him a speedy recovery.

27
00:03:13,645 --> 00:03:17,346
I couldn't help noticing some
expressions of shock or disbelief,

28
00:03:17,348 --> 00:03:19,148
or whatever it was you were doing,

29
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,217
when the councilman mentioned
that the yeagers...

30
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:24,820
Were going to be the stars
of a major motion picture.

31
00:03:24,822 --> 00:03:28,457
Many of you know Warren yeager
is a fine veterinarian...

32
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:30,860
And not a professional actor.

33
00:03:30,862 --> 00:03:33,162
But that's exactly the point.

34
00:03:33,164 --> 00:03:37,600
We're gathered here this afternoon
to film Warren and his family,

35
00:03:37,602 --> 00:03:40,670
and you folks and ourselves as well,

36
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:43,773
because we're making a movie
about reality.

37
00:03:49,547 --> 00:03:53,215
I'm sure you've all had the experience of
coming out of a motion picture theater...

38
00:03:53,217 --> 00:03:57,953
And saying to yourselves, "I've had
more interesting things happen to me..."

39
00:03:57,955 --> 00:04:00,790
"Than happened to those
characters in that picture.

40
00:04:00,792 --> 00:04:03,592
My life is
much more interesting."

41
00:04:03,594 --> 00:04:06,595
You know something?
You're right.

42
00:04:06,597 --> 00:04:09,165
The most hilarious comedy,

43
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:11,333
the most gripping drama,

44
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:14,036
the most suspenseful disasters,

45
00:04:14,038 --> 00:04:15,838
they don't happen on the movie screen.

46
00:04:16,974 --> 00:04:19,308
They happen in my backyard and yours.

47
00:04:24,749 --> 00:04:28,250
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

48
00:04:28,252 --> 00:04:31,253
So, please, just remember
two simple words...

49
00:04:31,255 --> 00:04:32,955
And everything will be perfect.

50
00:04:32,957 --> 00:04:34,857
Be yourselves.

51
00:04:34,859 --> 00:04:38,427
If you see our cameraman following Warren
or Jeanette, or one of the children...

52
00:04:38,429 --> 00:04:42,932
Into your homes, offices, cleaning
establishments or gas stations,

53
00:04:42,934 --> 00:04:45,234
don't try to do anything special.

54
00:04:45,236 --> 00:04:49,872
It's tempting to show off for the camera.
I know. I make my living that way.

55
00:04:49,874 --> 00:04:53,242
But in this case, we don't want a show.

56
00:04:53,244 --> 00:04:55,044
Let me correct myself.

57
00:04:55,046 --> 00:04:59,215
We want the greatest
show of all: Life!

58
00:04:59,217 --> 00:05:00,883
<i>Hey, you're great!</i>
You're great!

59
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:06,756
We're gonna have a b-a-l-l here.
I guarantee you.

60
00:05:06,758 --> 00:05:11,427
A lot of people have termed this project
an experiment, and I can't disagree.

61
00:05:11,429 --> 00:05:13,729
What experiment would be complete...

62
00:05:13,731 --> 00:05:16,198
Without the scientists,

63
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,734
<i>I'd like to introduce</i>
two of the finest...

64
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:21,637
<i>Psychological consultants</i>
that money can buy.

65
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:25,574
And I wouldn't want you to get the impression
we're buying either of these gentlemen.

66
00:05:27,111 --> 00:05:29,512
Actually, the one on the end is rented,

67
00:05:29,514 --> 00:05:34,183
and the gentleman sitting
next to him is leased.

68
00:05:34,185 --> 00:05:35,918
<i>No, I'm kidding.</i>

69
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,120
<i>The gentleman on the end...</i>
What can I say?

70
00:05:38,122 --> 00:05:42,291
He's from one of the most prestigious
institutes we have in this country.

71
00:05:42,293 --> 00:05:45,961
From Boulder, Colorado, from the
national institute of human behavior,

72
00:05:45,963 --> 00:05:50,166
would you welcome
Dr. Howard hill.

73
00:05:54,739 --> 00:05:57,139
And the gentleman sitting next to him...

74
00:05:57,141 --> 00:06:00,142
What can I say? You might have
seen him on some television shows.

75
00:06:00,144 --> 00:06:02,678
A well-known author.
He's written books.

76
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,680
<i>From the university</i> of Minnesota,

77
00:06:04,682 --> 00:06:07,449
<i>please give a nice welcome</i>
to Dr. Ted cleary.

78
00:06:11,856 --> 00:06:14,390
A lot of you probably thought
Ted didn't stand up.

79
00:06:14,392 --> 00:06:17,593
Actually, he is standing. Isn't that great?
He eats very little.

80
00:06:19,797 --> 00:06:22,097
<i>You folks love to laugh,</i> don't you?

81
00:06:22,099 --> 00:06:26,001
Well, more than anything else in the world,
I'd love to get into some humor with you,

82
00:06:26,003 --> 00:06:28,170
but we really don't have the time.

83
00:06:28,172 --> 00:06:31,340
We're meeting the yeagers at the
airport in less than half an hour.

84
00:06:31,342 --> 00:06:34,877
So before yours truly
has to skidaddle out of here,

85
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:38,247
I'd like, if I could,
to share my sentiments I have...

86
00:06:38,249 --> 00:06:42,451
About this beautiful city
with you, if I might.

87
00:06:42,453 --> 00:06:44,520
Mort!

88
00:06:46,257 --> 00:06:48,924
Ladies and gentleman, the man at
the piano, Mr. mort Lindsay...

89
00:06:48,926 --> 00:06:50,960
<i>From</i>
"the merv Griffin show."

90
00:06:50,962 --> 00:06:54,563
<i>And as much of his orchestra as</i>
we could afford to bring down.

91
00:06:58,769 --> 00:07:02,004
It's a little something I jotted down
on the plane coming in yesterday,

92
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,008
specially from me to you.

93
00:07:58,129 --> 00:08:01,463
Who are you? What do you do?
Paul lowell, lowell realty.

94
00:08:01,465 --> 00:08:04,166
Thanks very much for the house.
You got me my house.

95
00:08:04,168 --> 00:08:07,603
Who are you? Donna Stanley,
Stanley's gift shop at the airport.

96
00:08:07,605 --> 00:08:10,139
Thanks for that little
plastic cactus. Yes.

97
00:08:10,141 --> 00:08:12,074
And who are you?
I'm Jack from Cincinnati.

98
00:08:13,477 --> 00:08:15,477
You live down here?
Just visiting?

99
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:17,479
No, I came down to watch you work.

100
00:08:17,481 --> 00:08:19,548
Isn't that something?
God bless you.

101
00:08:37,335 --> 00:08:39,134
Two grand!

102
00:08:49,246 --> 00:08:51,046
Thank you.

103
00:08:51,048 --> 00:08:54,116
God bless you!
You're something else!

104
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,619
Thank you!

105
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:34,149
Hello.

106
00:10:34,151 --> 00:10:38,620
So many of us go through life doing one
thing and dreaming of doing something else.

107
00:10:38,622 --> 00:10:41,356
I'm one of those people.
I'm in show business.

108
00:10:41,358 --> 00:10:44,293
I'm fortunate to have
that job, but quite frankly,

109
00:10:44,295 --> 00:10:47,296
if I'd studied harder
or been graded more fairly,

110
00:10:47,298 --> 00:10:51,200
I would have been a scientist
or a doctor of some kind.

111
00:10:51,202 --> 00:10:54,336
Well, the fulfillment of that
dream finally happened for me...

112
00:10:54,338 --> 00:10:58,340
When I arrived here at the national
institute of human behavior,

113
00:10:58,342 --> 00:11:00,242
a few miles southwest
of Boulder, Colorado.

114
00:11:01,645 --> 00:11:04,012
I knew from the inception
of this motion picture...

115
00:11:04,014 --> 00:11:08,517
That without scientific guidance from a
nationally recognized research organization,

116
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:11,320
very few people
would take this seriously.

117
00:11:11,322 --> 00:11:13,522
However, with that guidance...

118
00:11:13,524 --> 00:11:16,225
We not only had a chance
at winning an Oscar,

119
00:11:16,227 --> 00:11:19,728
but possibly a nobel prize too.

120
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:22,631
It gives me the chills.

121
00:11:22,633 --> 00:11:24,800
Let's go inside.

122
00:11:28,439 --> 00:11:31,173
Come on.

123
00:11:31,175 --> 00:11:35,010
Thousands of people responded
<i>to the advertisements...</i>

124
00:11:35,012 --> 00:11:37,346
<i>Scientifically placed</i> by the institute.

125
00:11:37,348 --> 00:11:41,617
<i>They filled out preliminary</i> questionnaires
in the privacy <i>of their own homes.</i>

126
00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:47,022
<i>Then, the 210 best families were</i>
invited here for final testing.

127
00:11:47,024 --> 00:11:51,093
<i>These tests in Boulder</i> were designed
to choose <i>the one family unit...</i>

128
00:11:51,095 --> 00:11:54,296
<i>That could best reflect</i> day-to-day
living <i>in contemporary America,</i>

129
00:11:55,099 --> 00:11:57,099
<i>and at the same time...</i>

130
00:11:57,101 --> 00:12:00,035
<i>Hold a motion picture audience</i>
completely spellbound.

131
00:12:00,037 --> 00:12:02,237
During the time they stayed here,

132
00:12:02,239 --> 00:12:06,842
the 210 families underwent
more than 145 separate tests,

133
00:12:06,844 --> 00:12:09,278
totaling more than 2,500 test hours.

134
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,813
If these tests could be
converted into eggs,

135
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:15,551
it would be enough to feed a city the size
of St. Louis for more than two years...

136
00:12:15,553 --> 00:12:18,487
On a two-egg-per-person
per week basis.

137
00:12:18,489 --> 00:12:21,924
Sound complicated?
It was, and very expensive.

138
00:12:21,926 --> 00:12:25,627
However, even though we were paying
for this, for top security reasons...

139
00:12:25,629 --> 00:12:28,197
The institute allowed us
to film just a small portion...

140
00:12:28,199 --> 00:12:30,933
Of a few of the tests.

141
00:12:32,136 --> 00:12:34,269
Honey, I completely believe that.

142
00:12:34,271 --> 00:12:38,173
Test 40, one of three
<i>role reversal exercises.</i>

143
00:12:38,175 --> 00:12:41,343
Be someone else in your family.

144
00:12:41,345 --> 00:12:45,514
<i>This test was invaluable,</i> not just because
of the insights <i>it gave into relationships,</i>

145
00:12:45,516 --> 00:12:50,552
<i>but because it single-handedly</i> discouraged
23 families <i>from further participation,</i>

146
00:12:50,554 --> 00:12:54,423
<i>saving us more than $90,000</i>
in wasted testing costs.

147
00:12:54,425 --> 00:12:57,926
I wanna go out and play. No! You
heard what your mother said.

148
00:12:57,928 --> 00:13:00,362
You have to stay in, do your
homework and be quiet all day.

149
00:13:01,932 --> 00:13:04,399
But I wanna go out and play. No!

150
00:13:04,401 --> 00:13:06,568
Well, I want to.
I said no!

151
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:10,038
I said yes. I don't care what you say.
I'm the boss.

152
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,207
Now you're gonna get a beating.

153
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:14,977
I don't wanna do that.
Okay, okay. Harold, stop it!

154
00:13:14,979 --> 00:13:18,180
Don't call me Harold, call me "dad"!
Don't you hit me, you little...

155
00:13:18,182 --> 00:13:19,982
Damn you!

156
00:13:19,984 --> 00:13:22,551
All right.
<i>Thank you, folks.</i>

157
00:13:22,553 --> 00:13:24,553
<i>Thank you. Folks?</i>

158
00:13:24,555 --> 00:13:28,357
This was test 72, <i>one of 15 tests...</i>

159
00:13:28,359 --> 00:13:31,660
<i>Utilizing state-of-the-art</i>
computer technology.

160
00:13:31,662 --> 00:13:33,762
<i>This man...</i>

161
00:13:33,764 --> 00:13:37,666
<i>Was feeding all of</i>
his facial features into this...

162
00:13:37,668 --> 00:13:40,135
<i>The graphicon 8,000.</i>

163
00:13:40,137 --> 00:13:42,471
<i>This amazing computer</i>
would actually show...

164
00:13:42,473 --> 00:13:44,840
<i>What each family member's face</i>
would photograph like...

165
00:13:44,842 --> 00:13:46,908
<i>From every conceivable angle...</i>

166
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:49,411
<i>And then give us</i> a digital readout
<i>of their screen presence.</i>

167
00:14:13,237 --> 00:14:15,270
Okay, it should be simple.

168
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:20,709
Test 141, known simply
<i>as the driving test.</i>

169
00:14:20,711 --> 00:14:23,545
<i>Since much of anybody's life</i>
takes place in a car,

170
00:14:23,547 --> 00:14:27,516
<i>we wanted to make sure our</i>
family wasn't going to kill us.

171
00:14:27,518 --> 00:14:30,085
<i>Dummies, acting as cameramen,</i>
were placed...

172
00:14:30,087 --> 00:14:34,456
<i>In one of the 200 cars in the</i>
institute's mobile test fleet.

173
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,825
When I tell you to start,
put the car in reverse,

174
00:14:36,827 --> 00:14:39,027
back it up to that simulated garage. Go?

175
00:14:39,029 --> 00:14:41,930
In reverse and back
in there. Okay, fine.

176
00:14:53,277 --> 00:14:55,517
You were supposed to put it back
in the simulated garage.

177
00:14:57,014 --> 00:14:59,815
What simulated garage?
Okay.

178
00:14:59,817 --> 00:15:01,917
While the testing continued,

179
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:05,454
ground rules for the project
were slowly being developed.

180
00:15:05,456 --> 00:15:07,956
Most important was
the unusual agreement...

181
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:11,593
That only the studio and a few of
the doctors at the institute...

182
00:15:11,595 --> 00:15:15,263
Would actually be allowed to see
the film as it was being shot.

183
00:15:15,265 --> 00:15:17,546
The rest of us would have
to wait until the year was over.

184
00:15:18,736 --> 00:15:21,536
This was done to reduce
possible confusion...

185
00:15:21,538 --> 00:15:24,039
And to heighten the reality.

186
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:26,108
But, to really heighten the reality,

187
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:29,578
we needed a whole new generation
of motion picture equipment...

188
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:32,748
Equipment that could stay
out of our family's way.

189
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:36,551
Two systems were chosen.
First, from Japan,

190
00:15:36,553 --> 00:15:40,255
special heat-sensing
wall cameras like this.

191
00:15:40,257 --> 00:15:42,524
These would be installed
wherever feasible.

192
00:15:42,526 --> 00:15:46,061
<i>These amazing devices</i>
actually used body heat...

193
00:15:46,063 --> 00:15:48,130
<i>To focus in</i> on the nearest person.

194
00:15:48,132 --> 00:15:52,434
Quiet, efficient, expensive.

195
00:15:52,436 --> 00:15:55,337
And then, to capture what those couldn't,

196
00:15:55,339 --> 00:15:57,873
a startling breakthrough in technology.

197
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:00,542
The smallest, most versatile
motion picture camera ever made.

198
00:16:02,312 --> 00:16:07,549
From Holland,
the entanour 226-xl.

199
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:11,653
The etanour is actually worn
over the head.

200
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:15,891
The camera is controlled
by using body movement,

201
00:16:15,893 --> 00:16:20,529
and by operating this
human eye-like lens system.

202
00:16:22,966 --> 00:16:24,766
Isn't that something?

203
00:16:24,768 --> 00:16:27,235
And it can hear like a human too...

204
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:29,771
With these special
Omni-directional microphones...

205
00:16:29,773 --> 00:16:31,573
Located exactly where we have our ears.

206
00:16:33,744 --> 00:16:35,577
The etanour needs no special lighting.

207
00:16:37,848 --> 00:16:41,249
And it uses no film.

208
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:43,885
Yes, all picture and sound information...

209
00:16:43,887 --> 00:16:47,989
Is recorded digitally on
these integrated circuit chips,

210
00:16:47,991 --> 00:16:50,759
some no larger than a child's fingernail.

211
00:16:50,761 --> 00:16:53,061
When these chips are filled to capacity,

212
00:16:53,063 --> 00:16:57,199
they will be removed from this housing,
and then mailed back to the institute,

213
00:16:57,201 --> 00:17:01,336
where they're decoded and then
transferred to film as we know it.

214
00:17:01,338 --> 00:17:04,239
Only six of these cameras were ever made.

215
00:17:04,241 --> 00:17:06,842
Only five of them ever worked.

216
00:17:06,844 --> 00:17:09,644
We had four of those.

217
00:17:09,646 --> 00:17:11,646
<i>After six weeks of testing,</i>

218
00:17:11,648 --> 00:17:13,815
<i>the families had been</i>
narrowed down to two:

219
00:17:13,817 --> 00:17:19,254
<i>The Andrew feltons</i>
from green bay, Wisconsin,

220
00:17:19,256 --> 00:17:22,123
<i>and the Warren yeagers</i>
from Phoenix, Arizona.

221
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:25,627
<i>Using the sophisticated</i> equipment and
the institute's <i>direct-mail facility,</i>

222
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:28,630
<i>the other hundreds of families</i>
were notified...

223
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:31,132
<i>That they were unsuitable.</i>

224
00:17:42,012 --> 00:17:45,113
<i>Since these two finalists</i>
had never met before,

225
00:17:45,115 --> 00:17:49,117
<i>each family served as</i> a matching
set of strangers <i>for the other.</i>

226
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:52,320
<i>They were given</i> only one instruction
for <i>the hour-long encounter:</i>

227
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:54,322
<i>Be yourselves.</i>

228
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:57,158
You're with t.W.A.?
No, American.

229
00:18:02,099 --> 00:18:06,768
You get to fly for free, don't you?
We have to pay tax.

230
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:09,204
How much is the tax to Europe?

231
00:18:09,206 --> 00:18:12,274
I don't know exactly.

232
00:18:15,646 --> 00:18:20,148
Are there a maximum amount
of trips you can take? Yes.

233
00:18:22,553 --> 00:18:25,186
Sounds great.
Yes.

234
00:18:27,891 --> 00:18:31,326
To be perfectly frank,
we could find no difference.

235
00:18:31,328 --> 00:18:36,298
Our research was so thorough, the computers
actually coughed up two perfect families.

236
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:39,601
If I were a liar, I could tell you
we chose one over the other...

237
00:18:39,603 --> 00:18:42,370
For complicated psychological reasons.

238
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:44,673
But I'm a comedian, not a liar.

239
00:18:44,675 --> 00:18:47,509
I can afford the luxury of honesty.

240
00:18:47,511 --> 00:18:50,045
The feltons lived in Wisconsin.

241
00:18:50,047 --> 00:18:52,647
The yeagers lived in Arizona.

242
00:18:52,649 --> 00:18:55,183
You spend the winter in Wisconsin.

243
00:19:03,427 --> 00:19:05,527
Phoenix!

244
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:09,798
Almost one million people.

245
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,201
<i>The fastest growing Metropolis</i>
west of the Mississippi.

246
00:19:13,203 --> 00:19:15,303
<i>The yeagers lived here,</i>

247
00:19:15,305 --> 00:19:18,640
<i>in one of the newer sections</i> of
town, part of <i>the fifth district.</i>

248
00:19:18,642 --> 00:19:22,277
<i>Their house was located</i>
at the end of a cul-de-sac...

249
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:25,680
<i>Called</i> view crest heights drive.

250
00:19:25,682 --> 00:19:29,284
<i>Warren yeager worked here at</i>
the Arizona veterinary clinic,

251
00:19:29,286 --> 00:19:34,155
<i>one of the finest</i> veterinary
hospitals <i>in the new southwest.</i>

252
00:19:34,157 --> 00:19:38,593
<i>The children attended school</i> at
Benjamin Franklin <i>grammar school,</i>

253
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:41,429
<i>about two miles</i> from the family's home.

254
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:44,566
<i>I was fortunate</i> to purchase the house...

255
00:19:44,568 --> 00:19:48,136
<i>Directly across the street</i>
from the yeagers.

256
00:19:48,138 --> 00:19:52,107
<i>It was the first house I had</i>
ever owned, and I must say,

257
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:54,909
<i>I was proud.</i>

258
00:19:54,911 --> 00:19:57,178
That's it.

259
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:01,850
<i>This man, however,</i>
would not stop shaking my hand.

260
00:20:03,887 --> 00:20:07,989
<i>The yeagers were sent on</i> a two-week,
all-expense-paid <i>trip to Hawaii...</i>

261
00:20:07,991 --> 00:20:11,292
<i>So I could get settled in</i>
without disturbing them.

262
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:15,330
<i>I knew the house had</i> to be
furnished with great care.

263
00:20:18,035 --> 00:20:19,901
We're here!

264
00:20:27,911 --> 00:20:33,281
The living room was done
<i>in a Neo-mediterranean style.</i>

265
00:20:33,283 --> 00:20:38,253
<i>The playroom was done</i>
contemporary, with a fun touch.

266
00:20:38,255 --> 00:20:40,288
Let's put it outside.

267
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:42,924
<i>And the sleeping area...</i>

268
00:20:42,926 --> 00:20:46,027
<i>Well, with this round bed</i>
and large screen TV,

269
00:20:46,029 --> 00:20:50,532
<i>let's just say if there were</i> any single
girls in Phoenix, <i>I'd find them.</i>

270
00:20:50,534 --> 00:20:54,569
<i>The rest of the crew stayed
here</i> at the travel lodge,

271
00:20:54,571 --> 00:20:57,038
<i>a nice place.</i>

272
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,174
<i>But enough about the crew,</i>
for at this very moment...

273
00:20:59,176 --> 00:21:02,610
<i>A 707 was landing</i> nonstop from Hawaii...

274
00:21:02,612 --> 00:21:05,380
<i>With our stars aboard.</i>

275
00:21:09,086 --> 00:21:11,586
It's not degrading. What's
degrading about being introduced?

276
00:21:11,588 --> 00:21:14,055
Were you degraded? There's such a
thing as professional dignity.

277
00:21:14,057 --> 00:21:17,459
Why were you singing? You were just supposed to
inform them of the beginning of the project.

278
00:21:17,461 --> 00:21:20,562
I did inform 'em. What's so bad about
making them happy? They loved the song.

279
00:21:20,564 --> 00:21:23,631
I don't know about you, Howard, but I didn't
go to graduate school for five years...

280
00:21:23,633 --> 00:21:25,900
To be introduced as a part of an act.
An act!

281
00:21:25,902 --> 00:21:29,504
Howard, you've seen me work. That's not
my act, Ted. An act's a detailed thing.

282
00:21:29,506 --> 00:21:32,474
First you've got a set opening, then
you've got a three, four minute hunk.

283
00:21:32,476 --> 00:21:35,577
You follow that with a ten minute hunk.
<i>Mr. Brooks. Albert.</i>

284
00:21:35,579 --> 00:21:38,880
Someone knows me in Phoenix. Hi. How are you?
It's Warren. <i>We're in baggage!</i>

285
00:21:40,217 --> 00:21:42,884
We missed the plane.
Great, good. We're coming!

286
00:21:42,886 --> 00:21:46,654
I got mixed up myself. I thought
the plane... hey! Hello!

287
00:21:46,656 --> 00:21:49,557
We missed you!
He barely knows me.

288
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:52,694
Welcome home! Aloha!
Look at this.

289
00:21:52,696 --> 00:21:54,829
Look at this.
Real orchids.

290
00:21:54,831 --> 00:21:59,667
Hello, Mrs. yeager. And you.
Look at this. Come here.

291
00:21:59,669 --> 00:22:02,403
Look at that. Okay!
Do we know everybody?

292
00:22:02,405 --> 00:22:05,206
These are the etanours. I think
you read the literature on them.

293
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:07,642
These are my two
psychological consultants.

294
00:22:07,644 --> 00:22:11,112
They're gonna be with us for the entire
year, making sure everything is perfect.

295
00:22:11,114 --> 00:22:13,515
Did you meet Howard at the institute?
I don't think so.

296
00:22:13,517 --> 00:22:15,917
Dr. Howard hill.
He's from the institute.

297
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,019
This gentleman is gonna be with
us the entire year? Yes, he is.

298
00:22:18,021 --> 00:22:20,255
I won't be degrading.
I'll do it right this time.

299
00:22:20,257 --> 00:22:23,057
I'm Dr. Ted cleary. I'm not a
consultant, I'm more of an observer.

300
00:22:23,059 --> 00:22:27,295
I'm writing a series of articles on this project
for the <i>journal of American psychology.</i>

301
00:22:27,297 --> 00:22:29,864
He's a well-known author.
<i>Written lots of books.</i>

302
00:22:29,866 --> 00:22:32,400
<i>You know who's going to publish</i> the
articles he's writing? <i>Did you tell him?</i>

303
00:22:32,402 --> 00:22:35,370
I did tell him. -<i>The journal
of</i> American psychology.

304
00:22:35,372 --> 00:22:38,006
Maybe the most prestigious scientific
journal in the world. I swear to god.

305
00:22:38,008 --> 00:22:40,975
You know who reads these things?
Jonas salk, buckminster Fuller,

306
00:22:40,977 --> 00:22:43,144
William Buckley, every scientist living.

307
00:22:43,146 --> 00:22:45,380
They go to the mailbox,
they get it like magazines.

308
00:22:45,382 --> 00:22:48,016
We're all gonna be on
Jonas salk's coffee table.

309
00:22:48,018 --> 00:22:50,118
All right! Can you believe it?
He loves it.

310
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,987
One last thing, then I'm
staying out of your lives.

311
00:22:52,989 --> 00:22:56,291
Limo back to the house.
Just a special treat.

312
00:22:56,293 --> 00:22:59,561
Come on, let's go to the limo!
I wanna tell you something.

313
00:22:59,563 --> 00:23:03,064
We went to Maui. Jeanette didn't
want to go, but I told her...

314
00:23:03,066 --> 00:23:06,734
What am I supposed to do?
Get this luggage myself?

315
00:23:06,736 --> 00:23:10,505
Excuse me one moment.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, really.

316
00:23:10,507 --> 00:23:14,509
I'm sorry. I'm a little excited.
You're completely out of it.

317
00:23:14,511 --> 00:23:16,444
<i>Come on!</i> come on! Okay!

318
00:23:16,446 --> 00:23:19,948
<i>We got the whole crew</i> waitin'!
Okay. Come on, honey.

319
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:39,467
Mr. Theodore cleary!
All right, there he is!

320
00:23:39,469 --> 00:23:41,736
The yeagers!

321
00:23:41,738 --> 00:23:44,172
You won't believe it.
Look, it's your parents.

322
00:23:44,174 --> 00:23:46,941
We flew 'em in from Tucson.

323
00:23:48,211 --> 00:23:52,380
How are you?
It's nice to see you.

324
00:23:52,382 --> 00:23:54,816
Isn't this perfect?

325
00:23:54,818 --> 00:23:58,386
Okay, very quickly.
That's... love reunions.

326
00:23:58,388 --> 00:24:01,789
Very quickly, folks. We want to meet
your crew. We lined 'em all up.

327
00:24:01,791 --> 00:24:03,625
We'll do it just like they meet royalty.

328
00:24:03,627 --> 00:24:07,996
Now, Dr. and Mrs. yeager, Eric, Lisa.
We'll go down the line.

329
00:24:07,998 --> 00:24:11,966
This is wardrobe.
Trucker. Cameraman.

330
00:24:11,968 --> 00:24:14,335
First a.D. Second a.D. What's an a.D.?

331
00:24:14,337 --> 00:24:16,771
Assistant director. We'll get to
it in a second. Another trucker.

332
00:24:16,773 --> 00:24:19,974
What are these people's names? Not important.
Let me get through the list.

333
00:24:19,976 --> 00:24:22,043
- Wardrobe. Script.
- Script? Is there a script?

334
00:24:23,213 --> 00:24:25,280
No, they're all part of the package.

335
00:24:25,282 --> 00:24:27,715
Cameraman. Another cameraman. Grip.
Grip. How do you do? Hello.

336
00:24:27,717 --> 00:24:32,253
This is a trucker. This is a gopher,
this is a gopher... where? Where?

337
00:24:32,255 --> 00:24:35,657
No, Eric, these people here.
It's a term, okay?

338
00:24:35,659 --> 00:24:40,261
Publicity. This is a trucker,
driver and a trucker. Okay?

339
00:24:40,263 --> 00:24:42,864
There's a few other people.
They're not here right now.

340
00:24:42,866 --> 00:24:44,999
Of course, thanks to modern technology,

341
00:24:45,001 --> 00:24:48,169
these people really aren't needed,
but the union makes us take 'em.

342
00:24:48,171 --> 00:24:50,838
So, folks, we'll see you at the premiere,

343
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:54,008
have a nice time in Phoenix!
Enjoy your stay.

344
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:57,712
Thanks for coming. Get good tans.
Nice to see ya.

345
00:24:57,714 --> 00:24:59,714
See ya again.
Nice to see ya.

346
00:24:59,716 --> 00:25:01,749
Have a good stay.
See you next year.

347
00:25:01,751 --> 00:25:04,285
Nice to see ya.
Okay?

348
00:25:04,287 --> 00:25:06,988
So, what can I tell you?
Welcome home.

349
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:09,590
You wanna film something of us
coming out of the car?

350
00:25:09,592 --> 00:25:12,527
You kind of look tired.
Why don't you go in your house?

351
00:25:12,529 --> 00:25:14,629
Make yourself at home, all right?

352
00:25:14,631 --> 00:25:18,433
I want to go over the rules, but we can
do that and the filming schedule later.

353
00:25:18,435 --> 00:25:21,135
You sure? He just said so, didn't he?

354
00:25:21,137 --> 00:25:24,238
Okay? So break a leg!
Be yourselves!

355
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,441
Thank you for everything.
Don't worry about it.

356
00:25:26,443 --> 00:25:30,278
Those leis keep. Put 'em in the freezer.
<i>Okay. Thank you.</i>

357
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:33,648
<i>Have a good time now.</i> Be yourselves!
<i>They look great.</i>

358
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:36,584
They're great.
They're great.

359
00:25:36,586 --> 00:25:39,053
They were great.
<i>What a family.</i>

360
00:25:39,055 --> 00:25:42,390
<i>The long trip from Hawaii</i> did leave
them a bit fatigued, <i>however.</i>

361
00:25:42,392 --> 00:25:45,994
<i>Especially Mrs. yeager,</i> who
thought she had <i>a slight fever.</i>

362
00:25:45,996 --> 00:25:49,497
<i>Although Dr. yeager said</i> it would be
all right <i>to film them unpacking,</i>

363
00:25:49,499 --> 00:25:52,900
<i>I thought it was appropriate</i> to
give them an hour <i>by themselves...</i>

364
00:25:52,902 --> 00:25:56,404
<i>To relax and</i> get ready for dinner.

365
00:25:56,406 --> 00:26:00,742
<i>I took the opportunity to</i>
finish antiquing my end table.

366
00:26:01,911 --> 00:26:06,347
"Continuous motion
for oldest effect."

367
00:26:08,685 --> 00:26:11,219
<i>The hour passed very quickly.</i>

368
00:26:13,156 --> 00:26:16,424
<i>And before I knew it,</i>
we were ready to join them...

369
00:26:16,426 --> 00:26:19,160
<i>For their first supper.</i>

370
00:26:26,936 --> 00:26:30,138
Eat your pizza, honey.
Good pizza.

371
00:26:44,788 --> 00:26:46,988
Honey, do you think it's safe...

372
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:50,158
For you to be eating with
your heating pad in your lap?

373
00:26:51,494 --> 00:26:55,129
I have terrible cramps,
I am bleeding profusely...

374
00:26:55,131 --> 00:26:57,131
And I want to vomit on the table.

375
00:26:57,133 --> 00:27:00,868
What are you doing?

376
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:03,738
I just wanna let them know
this is not the way...

377
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:07,075
We usually talk,
especially at the dinner table.

378
00:27:11,014 --> 00:27:14,315
Okay. Why don't we...
Why don't we just,

379
00:27:14,317 --> 00:27:19,053
pretend that we just sat down,
and we can start over, okay?

380
00:27:23,793 --> 00:27:25,827
Great pizza, kids?
Kids?

381
00:27:25,829 --> 00:27:28,062
I hate it.
You hate it.

382
00:27:33,136 --> 00:27:35,436
Eric.
Goddamn it, Eric!

383
00:27:35,438 --> 00:27:38,339
Watch your mouth, young lady. This is not the
kind of language we use at the dinner table.

384
00:27:38,341 --> 00:27:40,842
Since when have we had all these
rules at the dinner table?

385
00:27:40,844 --> 00:27:45,513
- Lisa, don't use my good linen napkin to wipe that up!
- What am I supposed to use?

386
00:27:45,515 --> 00:27:49,117
- There are no other napkins in the house.
- There are napkins in the house.

387
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:51,385
Honey, your mother's very uncomfortable.

388
00:27:51,387 --> 00:27:55,356
If you get smart with her again, I'm gonna
have to punish you. Do you understand, honey?

389
00:27:55,358 --> 00:27:58,860
I hate it in here!
You don't have to eat here.

390
00:27:58,862 --> 00:28:01,696
If you didn't, there'd be plenty
more food for the rest of us.

391
00:28:01,698 --> 00:28:04,899
Don't start making her
feel guilty about the food.

392
00:28:04,901 --> 00:28:07,668
God, you make me sick.

393
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:09,470
Because I stick up for you?

394
00:28:09,472 --> 00:28:11,772
Eric, why don't you just leave the towel?

395
00:28:11,774 --> 00:28:14,342
Wanna take your pizza into your room?

396
00:28:14,344 --> 00:28:17,411
<i>Take your pizza into your room</i>
and watch some TV.

397
00:28:17,413 --> 00:28:19,347
<i>Okay?</i>
Okay.

398
00:28:19,349 --> 00:28:22,416
Why does he have to finish
his dinner in the other room?

399
00:28:22,418 --> 00:28:24,819
<i>I thought he could have</i>
more fun eating there.

400
00:28:24,821 --> 00:28:27,688
He can't have fun here?

401
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:30,358
It's hard to have fun when you
have to listen to your mother...

402
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,194
Whining about her terrible
menstrual cramps every day.

403
00:28:33,196 --> 00:28:35,196
I mean, every day.
<i>I agree.</i>

404
00:28:35,198 --> 00:28:38,432
And it is also not much fun to
have an I.U.D. Stuck in you...

405
00:28:38,434 --> 00:28:40,968
To prevent, as you put it,
more mouths to feed.

406
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:44,705
I... look,
I never said that.

407
00:28:44,707 --> 00:28:48,176
I don't care what you said. I am
having this coil taken out Monday.

408
00:28:48,178 --> 00:28:52,647
And from now on, if you want safe sex, you
can have it with one of your animals!

409
00:28:52,649 --> 00:28:55,483
I know you didn't mean anything by that,

410
00:28:55,485 --> 00:28:58,986
so I'm not gonna say anything,
I'm just...

411
00:28:58,988 --> 00:29:01,856
You're just upset,
the way everybody gets.

412
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,574
What a great day,

413
00:29:19,576 --> 00:29:21,809
sounds real exciting
over there, doesn't it?

414
00:29:21,811 --> 00:29:25,346
You been out spying on the neighborhood?
I'm not spying on anybody.

415
00:29:25,348 --> 00:29:27,949
I live here. I'm allowed to
walk up and down the street.

416
00:29:27,951 --> 00:29:31,018
What'd you think, Howard?
Real good action for day one.

417
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,688
Real good.
Well, tension, not action.

418
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:37,391
Tension is action.
Don't you ever go to plays?

419
00:29:37,393 --> 00:29:39,827
What'd you think, Ted?
Some good insights for you?

420
00:29:39,829 --> 00:29:42,096
If I were running this project,

421
00:29:42,098 --> 00:29:46,067
those people would have gotten some rest
tonight and day one would've been tomorrow.

422
00:29:46,069 --> 00:29:49,303
We all pretty much agreed at the meeting
that when they got off the plane,

423
00:29:49,305 --> 00:29:51,405
that was the beginning.
Absolutely!

424
00:29:51,407 --> 00:29:53,441
We all pretty much agreed,
but I disagreed.

425
00:29:53,443 --> 00:29:56,744
Look, it's done.
It's on film.

426
00:29:56,746 --> 00:29:59,380
I think we gotta keep remembering,
whatever we do is fine,

427
00:29:59,382 --> 00:30:01,382
it's perfect, it's the movie.

428
00:30:01,384 --> 00:30:03,684
Great.
It may be fine and perfect,

429
00:30:03,686 --> 00:30:07,655
but that added tension is making your
leading man come off very unsympathetic.

430
00:30:07,657 --> 00:30:10,057
What? That's only my observation.

431
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:12,193
No, he's very sympathetic.

432
00:30:12,195 --> 00:30:15,296
If you don't look at it from the
dramatic point, you'll never see it.

433
00:30:15,298 --> 00:30:17,865
Here's a guy.
He's got a wife, two kids.

434
00:30:17,867 --> 00:30:21,369
He's threatened by society. Come on now!

435
00:30:21,371 --> 00:30:24,772
No! On one hand, he doesn't want to make
the same mistakes his parents made.

436
00:30:24,774 --> 00:30:28,175
On the other hand, he's not so sure
his parents made mistakes. He's torn.

437
00:30:28,177 --> 00:30:30,478
Maybe he likes himself, maybe he doesn't.

438
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,747
Jesus, I think it's a hell
of a complex character.

439
00:30:32,749 --> 00:30:35,483
Don't you think so, Howard?
He's complex.

440
00:30:35,485 --> 00:30:38,352
He's fine. Just relax. I am relaxed!

441
00:30:38,354 --> 00:30:43,224
I don't like my leading man being called
unsympathetic on the basis of 4 minutes of film.

442
00:30:43,226 --> 00:30:46,294
He's good, he's good.

443
00:30:46,296 --> 00:30:49,597
He was good at the airport.
He was good! Yeah.

444
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:52,533
On one hand he likes himself,
on the other hand he doesn't.

445
00:30:52,535 --> 00:30:54,402
Honey?

446
00:30:55,438 --> 00:30:57,605
Honey, what's the problem?

447
00:30:57,607 --> 00:31:00,474
There's no problem. I just don't
like you very much right now.

448
00:31:00,476 --> 00:31:04,812
Cramps is a bad beginning for your movie,
so I'm gonna spend the weekend at Bonnie's.

449
00:31:04,814 --> 00:31:08,182
It's our movie. It was our decision.
You don't have to leave.

450
00:31:08,184 --> 00:31:10,818
What about the children?
The children know.

451
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:13,154
I'm sure they could film
your better moments.

452
00:31:13,156 --> 00:31:15,156
Don't make me get in an argument.

453
00:31:15,158 --> 00:31:18,125
There's no argument. After all,
they're paying for the whole family.

454
00:31:18,127 --> 00:31:20,127
I'll call you tomorrow.

455
00:31:20,129 --> 00:31:23,130
Honey, you wanted this as much as I did.

456
00:31:23,132 --> 00:31:25,333
<i>You'll benefit from it</i> too.

457
00:31:25,335 --> 00:31:27,401
Warren, will you please...

458
00:31:37,013 --> 00:31:39,680
Latch onto Jeanette!

459
00:31:39,682 --> 00:31:44,385
Hello, Mrs. yeager!
Where you going?

460
00:31:46,489 --> 00:31:49,790
Listen, I would just like to go
be alone for a little while.

461
00:31:49,792 --> 00:31:53,160
I think I need to be alone now.
Can we come with you?

462
00:31:53,162 --> 00:31:54,729
No, I really want to be alone.

463
00:31:54,731 --> 00:31:56,964
Well...
Just by myself.

464
00:31:56,966 --> 00:32:01,035
We're gonna have to deal with this thing
later because this wasn't in the rules.

465
00:32:01,037 --> 00:32:04,372
It's all right. Go ahead.
Would you take the little car?

466
00:32:04,374 --> 00:32:08,576
We're gonna drive to work with Warren.
We'd like to use the station wagon.

467
00:32:09,979 --> 00:32:14,115
It's just hard to fit both...
Cameras in there.

468
00:32:14,117 --> 00:32:15,950
Could one person come with you? <i>No.</i>

469
00:32:15,952 --> 00:32:18,152
One? That's all right. Go ahead. <i>Please?</i>

470
00:32:18,154 --> 00:32:21,322
I need to be by myself.
Okay. I understand.

471
00:32:21,324 --> 00:32:25,192
There's a lot of room
in here if we just... one...

472
00:32:42,879 --> 00:32:45,679
If you'd like to go beyond
the original year...

473
00:32:45,681 --> 00:32:48,048
To make up these days, it's okay.

474
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:50,351
No, I don't think you understand.

475
00:32:50,353 --> 00:32:52,720
There's no making up days.

476
00:32:52,722 --> 00:32:55,156
This is the reality.
This is it.

477
00:32:55,158 --> 00:32:57,158
She left.
That's real.

478
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,160
Everything that happens...
Even us now...

479
00:32:59,162 --> 00:33:01,495
It's all...
It's all the reality.

480
00:33:01,497 --> 00:33:04,098
Very good.
She came out angry like that.

481
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:07,468
Got right in the car. You followed her.
All very good stuff.

482
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:09,303
Very, very good.
Really.

483
00:33:09,305 --> 00:33:14,341
I should just go on living as usual?
That's it.

484
00:33:14,343 --> 00:33:17,111
Don't worry about anything.
You're very good.

485
00:33:17,113 --> 00:33:19,447
Thanks.

486
00:33:19,449 --> 00:33:22,183
Warren yeager tried to carry on
<i>as if nothing had happened,</i>

487
00:33:22,185 --> 00:33:25,986
<i>but it was obvious</i> he was uncomfortable
because <i>of his wife's absence.</i>

488
00:33:28,524 --> 00:33:31,325
Honey?

489
00:33:31,327 --> 00:33:35,529
Honey, the music goes
right into my bedroom.

490
00:33:35,531 --> 00:33:37,531
<i>What are you doing?
What are you doing?</i>

491
00:33:37,533 --> 00:33:39,500
<i>I'm fantasizing.
Don't fantasize.</i>

492
00:33:39,502 --> 00:33:42,670
I'm a big motion picture star.

493
00:33:42,672 --> 00:33:44,405
These are my cameras.

494
00:33:44,407 --> 00:33:46,874
That's my director.

495
00:33:46,876 --> 00:33:49,376
And you are my lover.
Okay.

496
00:33:49,378 --> 00:33:51,645
Kiss me, my beautiful lover.

497
00:33:51,647 --> 00:33:53,714
Take me in your arms and kiss me.

498
00:33:53,716 --> 00:33:56,350
Take off the dress. It's
your confirmation dress.

499
00:33:56,352 --> 00:33:58,853
How long we've been apart.
Listen to what you're saying.

500
00:33:58,855 --> 00:34:01,989
Take and kiss me like
you've never kissed me before.

501
00:34:01,991 --> 00:34:05,292
Honey, come on. You're gonna get hit.
Now get out of this dress.

502
00:34:05,294 --> 00:34:09,096
I can stay in this dress. Mother
said I could. I'll bet she did.

503
00:34:09,098 --> 00:34:13,234
She did! Ask her, if she ever comes back.
Okay, come on. That's it.

504
00:34:13,236 --> 00:34:15,703
Where's Eric? He's playing with the crew.

505
00:34:15,705 --> 00:34:20,374
- He's not supposed to. Didn't you tell him that?
- No, I'm not his mother.

506
00:34:20,376 --> 00:34:23,310
Okay, don't get smart with me!

507
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:28,816
Cereal on the floor.

508
00:34:28,818 --> 00:34:33,454
I'll just make breakfast now.
I'll make some eggs.

509
00:34:33,456 --> 00:34:36,991
Put this back.
I'll make eggs.

510
00:34:36,993 --> 00:34:40,060
On Sunday,
<i>Mrs. yeager called me...</i>

511
00:34:40,062 --> 00:34:42,463
<i>And said she would be</i>
coming home that evening,

512
00:34:42,465 --> 00:34:44,899
<i>but asked if she could</i>
see me first privately...

513
00:34:44,901 --> 00:34:47,101
<i>At the desert Plaza</i> shopping center.

514
00:34:47,103 --> 00:34:51,372
So he says, "you think that's
bad, her sister's twice as fat."

515
00:34:56,913 --> 00:34:59,146
Over here.

516
00:34:59,148 --> 00:35:02,583
<i>The institute and I agreed</i> that private
meetings <i>with any family members...</i>

517
00:35:02,585 --> 00:35:06,620
<i>Should be discouraged,</i>
but this did sound important.

518
00:35:06,622 --> 00:35:09,423
I was hoping we could be alone.

519
00:35:09,425 --> 00:35:12,726
This is alone. This is
alone as I ever get.

520
00:35:12,728 --> 00:35:15,663
How was your weekend?
It was okay.

521
00:35:15,665 --> 00:35:17,731
Thank you for giving me that time.

522
00:35:17,733 --> 00:35:21,669
I know how important the movie is to you.

523
00:35:21,671 --> 00:35:23,837
I'm sorry. I know
you didn't have to do it.

524
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:26,473
Don't worry about it. I mean, it's important.
I didn't have to do it.

525
00:35:26,475 --> 00:35:30,844
But it's a decision, and I made it.
It was a loving decision.

526
00:35:30,846 --> 00:35:33,647
God, no. No love.

527
00:35:33,649 --> 00:35:36,116
It's just a decision.
I'm making 'em all the time.

528
00:35:36,118 --> 00:35:39,853
What's up?
Why'd you want to meet me?

529
00:35:39,855 --> 00:35:42,356
I wanted to tell you that I like you,

530
00:35:42,358 --> 00:35:46,026
and that this movie does mean as much
to me as it does to everybody else.

531
00:35:46,028 --> 00:35:50,164
I hope I didn't hurt anything.
No, no. Nothing can hurt it.

532
00:35:50,166 --> 00:35:54,134
That's the beauty part of this film.
It is what it is.

533
00:35:54,136 --> 00:35:58,405
It's like a movie in a movie, in a
movie, in a movie. You know what I mean?

534
00:35:58,407 --> 00:36:00,808
Well, you were very sweet,

535
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:03,444
and I wanted to do something
for you in return.

536
00:36:03,446 --> 00:36:07,715
Don't.
No, really, I want to.

537
00:36:07,717 --> 00:36:10,751
I made an appointment
with my gynecologist...

538
00:36:10,753 --> 00:36:13,354
For a quarter to 10:00
tomorrow morning.

539
00:36:13,356 --> 00:36:18,626
And if you want to, you and the
crew can feel free to join me.

540
00:36:18,628 --> 00:36:21,729
Film the gynecologist?

541
00:36:21,731 --> 00:36:25,833
Mrs. yeager!
I can't be... boy!

542
00:36:25,835 --> 00:36:29,269
Yes! Great!
There's one small problem.

543
00:36:29,271 --> 00:36:31,705
I'm not gonna shoot anything
that'll embarrass you. I swear.

544
00:36:31,707 --> 00:36:34,241
I couldn't use it anyway.
I'm locked into a p.G.

545
00:36:34,243 --> 00:36:38,612
I didn't mean anything like that.
No, it's Warren. I...

546
00:36:38,614 --> 00:36:41,749
I haven't told Warren
that you're going with me,

547
00:36:41,751 --> 00:36:43,784
and I don't think
that anyone should tell him.

548
00:36:44,887 --> 00:36:47,554
See, this thing is so new to him,

549
00:36:47,556 --> 00:36:50,324
and he's very nervous and edgy.

550
00:36:50,326 --> 00:36:54,094
I'm sure that in a month or two
it would be fine, you know.

551
00:36:54,096 --> 00:36:55,796
But right now he's a little upset and...

552
00:36:57,133 --> 00:37:00,601
Since it wasn't planned...

553
00:37:00,603 --> 00:37:05,305
I just... I think
he would say no...

554
00:37:06,442 --> 00:37:10,611
And we would just get
into another argument.

555
00:37:10,613 --> 00:37:13,814
And I'm real tired of arguing with him.

556
00:37:13,816 --> 00:37:16,617
Look...

557
00:37:16,619 --> 00:37:20,020
Go home. I don't know what's happening.

558
00:37:20,022 --> 00:37:24,058
He just doesn't seem to understand
anything at all anymore.

559
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:30,698
Mrs. yeager, let me
ask you a question.

560
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:34,501
Do you think he comes off unsympathetic?

561
00:37:34,503 --> 00:37:38,639
No. No, really. See if you can
detach yourself for a minute.

562
00:37:38,641 --> 00:37:40,941
Look at it from the dramatic point.

563
00:37:40,943 --> 00:37:44,111
Here's a guy.
He's got a wife, two kids.

564
00:37:44,113 --> 00:37:47,481
He's threatened, you know?
Threatened by society.

565
00:37:47,483 --> 00:37:49,450
On one hand he's got the parental thing,

566
00:37:49,452 --> 00:37:51,952
on the other hand he's got
the pressures of his work.

567
00:37:51,954 --> 00:37:54,421
An audience has got to have
sympathy for a guy like this.

568
00:37:54,423 --> 00:37:58,459
He's a very complex guy. People have
sympathy for a guy who's complex.

569
00:37:58,461 --> 00:38:01,995
Don't you think so? Think about it.
He is complex, isn't he?

570
00:38:01,997 --> 00:38:05,866
You're such a sensitive man.
No, no.

571
00:38:05,868 --> 00:38:08,335
It's just a theory.
I'm not, no.

572
00:38:08,337 --> 00:38:13,240
Well, I want you to meet me
outside my doctor's building...

573
00:38:13,242 --> 00:38:16,643
At a quarter to 10:00
tomorrow morning. Okay.

574
00:38:16,645 --> 00:38:18,712
Okay?
Okay.

575
00:38:18,714 --> 00:38:21,348
I'm gonna go home now.
Okay.

576
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:23,884
You gave me the strength.

577
00:38:23,886 --> 00:38:25,686
Thanks.

578
00:38:25,688 --> 00:38:28,188
I...

579
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:31,492
I didn't give you... I gave
you nothing, Mrs. yeager.

580
00:38:31,494 --> 00:38:35,629
No, no, I gave you nothing. Don't think
I'm anything better than what you have.

581
00:38:35,631 --> 00:38:38,298
<i>You think I've got</i> this
charisma, <i>but I don't!</i>

582
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,801
I really don't, Mrs. yeager.
It's just...

583
00:38:40,803 --> 00:38:43,971
I have a little bit of it, but it just
sits on the surface. It doesn't run deep.

584
00:38:43,973 --> 00:38:46,673
<i>No kissing.
Deeper than you think.</i>

585
00:38:46,675 --> 00:38:51,111
<i>I'll call you tomorrow. Mrs. yeager,
it's been measured. It doesn't run deep.</i>

586
00:38:51,113 --> 00:38:54,782
No kissing here. I'm a shallowfellow.
Look. Shallow, shallow.

587
00:38:54,784 --> 00:38:59,219
<i>Really! Shallow!</i>

588
00:38:59,221 --> 00:39:01,789
She didn't know.
What am I gonna do?

589
00:39:01,791 --> 00:39:04,458
I didn't call this.
I didn't do it.

590
00:39:06,996 --> 00:39:11,431
Let me just...
Go out of frame this way.

591
00:39:11,433 --> 00:39:13,233
All right.

592
00:39:13,235 --> 00:39:17,104
During the examination,
basically get her expressions.

593
00:39:17,106 --> 00:39:20,641
Just very nice. No...
We're not gonna shoot anything...

594
00:39:20,643 --> 00:39:23,277
Just perfect. Just like
this, I trust you.

595
00:39:23,279 --> 00:39:26,413
No, don't. No trust.
No, honestly. Shallow.

596
00:39:26,415 --> 00:39:29,283
No. Just a decision. These are
just decisions. <i>Mrs. yeager?</i>

597
00:39:29,285 --> 00:39:31,618
<i>The doctor</i> will see you now.
All right, here we go.

598
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:34,121
Tasteful. Taste.
Just remember.

599
00:39:34,123 --> 00:39:37,758
Excuse me. I don't think
the doctor would like...

600
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,627
Anyone other than the patient
in the examining room.

601
00:39:40,629 --> 00:39:42,896
There's been a mistake.
See?

602
00:39:42,898 --> 00:39:45,165
We're filming her life,
and we have her permission.

603
00:39:45,167 --> 00:39:48,635
Someone from my crew was here
this morning and got a release.

604
00:39:48,637 --> 00:39:50,437
No, not today.
You must be mistaken.

605
00:39:50,439 --> 00:39:54,508
I don't think I'm mistaken.
I'll check.

606
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:57,177
Margaret, be with you in a few minutes.

607
00:39:57,179 --> 00:40:00,881
Mrs. yeager, how you feeling?
Much better, thank you.

608
00:40:00,883 --> 00:40:03,650
What are these?
These are cameras.

609
00:40:03,652 --> 00:40:06,053
No.
Goddamn it!

610
00:40:06,055 --> 00:40:09,089
What's going on? I was cleared!
Come on, get out of here!

611
00:40:09,091 --> 00:40:11,625
Wait, wait, wait. This
is a big motion picture.

612
00:40:11,627 --> 00:40:14,228
I'm Albert Brooks. I don't
care who the hell you are!

613
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:16,997
Talk to my lawyers.
I was cleared. Get out. Out!

614
00:40:16,999 --> 00:40:19,299
Dr. rennert, these people are with me.
They're filming my life.

615
00:40:19,301 --> 00:40:22,836
I'm sorry, but I've had some bad
experiences with the <i>60 minutes people.</i>

616
00:40:22,838 --> 00:40:26,340
No, we're not news. We're not digging.
I don't even ask questions.

617
00:40:26,342 --> 00:40:29,476
I'm just filming her, and right
now you're in their life.

618
00:40:29,478 --> 00:40:31,745
They're in <i>my life!</i>
<i>Mrs. yeager, I'm getting angry.</i>

619
00:40:31,747 --> 00:40:34,014
My blood pressure's starting to soar.

620
00:40:34,016 --> 00:40:38,051
What do you want me to do? You want them in
here? Fine. They can take out your I.U.D.

621
00:40:38,053 --> 00:40:40,220
Two thorazine.
<i>You don't understand.</i>

622
00:40:40,222 --> 00:40:43,123
I know what he wants.
This isn't a student film.

623
00:40:43,125 --> 00:40:46,927
What are we talking about?
Look.

624
00:40:46,929 --> 00:40:48,929
There's four of us here, okay?

625
00:40:48,931 --> 00:40:51,298
He wants an abortion.
All right?

626
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,100
Two. Make it two.

627
00:40:53,102 --> 00:40:55,936
I'll take a hysterectomy.
She'll have the same.

628
00:40:55,938 --> 00:40:59,139
How about this for parking?
You think $500 might do it?

629
00:40:59,141 --> 00:41:02,342
I just wanna film her life.
Please, don't make trouble.

630
00:41:02,344 --> 00:41:05,312
You're gonna give me $500
to film an examination?

631
00:41:05,314 --> 00:41:07,447
My god!
Maxwell rennert.

632
00:41:07,449 --> 00:41:09,750
The baby broker!
Goddamn it!

633
00:41:09,752 --> 00:41:12,386
Get out of here! I don't need this!
I can't believe it!

634
00:41:12,388 --> 00:41:14,554
Didn't you see that incredible thing
Mike Wallace did on this man?

635
00:41:14,556 --> 00:41:16,590
Sold children. They were
like baby slave auctions.

636
00:41:16,592 --> 00:41:18,725
<i>One of the best things</i>
on 60 minutes <i>I've ever seen!</i>

637
00:41:18,727 --> 00:41:21,461
Mike Wallace sent me a letter of apology.
I'll bet. Let's see it.

638
00:41:21,463 --> 00:41:24,131
It's out being perma-plaqued.
You get out of here, goddamn it.

639
00:41:24,133 --> 00:41:28,669
Go on, get out. Go on, out. You, get out.
Just a minute.

640
00:41:28,671 --> 00:41:31,939
This guy's nuts!
<i>I want this!</i>

641
00:41:31,941 --> 00:41:35,609
Look at me. My hands
<i>are shakin' like a 90-year-old.</i>

642
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:07,407
Hello?

643
00:42:07,409 --> 00:42:09,409
Hi. Did I wake you?

644
00:42:11,914 --> 00:42:15,182
I fell asleep for a minute.
I'm up though.

645
00:42:15,184 --> 00:42:17,117
How are you? How you feeling?
Not too well.

646
00:42:19,054 --> 00:42:23,190
Listen, Mrs. yeager.
I'm very sorry about yesterday.

647
00:42:23,192 --> 00:42:26,693
Maybe somebody in the crew can
help you find another doctor.

648
00:42:26,695 --> 00:42:30,030
What do you think? No, that's okay.
I'm not...

649
00:42:30,032 --> 00:42:32,065
That's okay.
Okay.

650
00:42:32,067 --> 00:42:34,334
Hey, it's a nice sunny day out,

651
00:42:34,336 --> 00:42:36,703
is there anyplace to go
horseback riding around here?

652
00:42:36,705 --> 00:42:41,008
My grandmother had a stroke
this morning. My god!

653
00:42:42,411 --> 00:42:44,411
That's terrible.

654
00:42:44,413 --> 00:42:46,913
How old is she?
Eighty-one.

655
00:42:46,915 --> 00:42:49,950
Well, that's very old.
I mean...

656
00:42:49,952 --> 00:42:53,286
That's almost 90.
Did you tell Warren?

657
00:42:53,288 --> 00:42:56,156
No, not yet.

658
00:42:56,158 --> 00:43:01,695
Mrs. yeager, you didn't
call me first! Yeah.

659
00:43:01,697 --> 00:43:03,163
Don't do that.
Share this with him.

660
00:43:05,934 --> 00:43:08,702
I hope she'll be okay.
I just...

661
00:43:08,704 --> 00:43:11,204
She'll be all right.

662
00:43:11,206 --> 00:43:14,174
I hadn't called in about three months.

663
00:43:14,176 --> 00:43:17,310
Honey!

664
00:43:17,312 --> 00:43:19,980
I just...

665
00:43:21,917 --> 00:43:23,717
Hi.

666
00:43:23,719 --> 00:43:25,952
Gotta go!

667
00:43:25,954 --> 00:43:29,256
You cry it through, Mrs. yeager. Be alone.
Share it with her husband.

668
00:43:29,258 --> 00:43:32,259
She called me. What are you writing?
Just some notes.

669
00:43:32,261 --> 00:43:34,728
Ted, she called me.
What kind of notes?

670
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:37,798
What happened to the effort we were supposed
to be making to stay out of their lives?

671
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,966
Ted, she called me.

672
00:43:39,968 --> 00:43:41,968
Ted doesn't understand.

673
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:44,871
Ted! Ted!

674
00:43:44,873 --> 00:43:46,973
<i>Ted!</i>

675
00:43:48,944 --> 00:43:52,779
Ted, look, I didn't do anything here.

676
00:43:52,781 --> 00:43:57,250
It's only the first week, and she seems
to be relying on you quite a bit.

677
00:43:57,252 --> 00:44:00,520
What do you mean? Why didn't
she call her husband?

678
00:44:00,522 --> 00:44:04,257
Ask her that. I'm not
the Indian rubber man.

679
00:44:04,259 --> 00:44:06,760
My arm didn't slither across
the street, dial her phone...

680
00:44:06,762 --> 00:44:09,496
And then snap back in.

681
00:44:09,498 --> 00:44:12,899
Is the <i>journal gonna print I'm
interfering because I took a call?</i>

682
00:44:12,901 --> 00:44:14,968
I don't know what
the <i>journal's gonna print.</i>

683
00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:17,104
Ted, we've got to lighten up here.

684
00:44:17,106 --> 00:44:20,040
Her grandmother had a stroke.

685
00:44:20,042 --> 00:44:25,212
You know, I'm wondering if maybe you're
a little uncomfortable because...

686
00:44:25,214 --> 00:44:28,748
Well, you know,
it's Phoenix and you're...

687
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:30,550
The only...

688
00:44:30,552 --> 00:44:34,187
Well, you know.
There's not a, a lot of...

689
00:44:34,189 --> 00:44:36,189
It's Phoenix.
There's...

690
00:44:36,191 --> 00:44:40,160
You know what I'm trying
to say? Y-you're, you're...

691
00:44:41,497 --> 00:44:43,296
You're the only...

692
00:44:43,298 --> 00:44:47,300
Albert, you have more trouble
dealing with a black person...

693
00:44:47,302 --> 00:44:49,336
Than any white man I have ever met.

694
00:44:49,338 --> 00:44:51,304
I beg your pardon?

695
00:44:51,306 --> 00:44:55,842
Hey, black meets white. Ted,
I'm not trying to do anything.

696
00:44:55,844 --> 00:44:58,845
I'm just trying to tune in on
your particular level of anxiety.

697
00:44:58,847 --> 00:45:00,780
That's all.
Boogie! Boogie! Boo!

698
00:45:00,782 --> 00:45:04,985
Ted, stop distorting... no, I'm
not black, nor do I claim to be.

699
00:45:04,987 --> 00:45:08,088
Yes, there's fears, misunderstandings,
and all that other mumbo-jumbo,

700
00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:10,390
but they should have nothing
to do with this project.

701
00:45:10,392 --> 00:45:13,360
I know more than anybody else that you
people are gonna take over the earth, okay?

702
00:45:13,362 --> 00:45:15,462
You're stronger, faster.
You use heat better.

703
00:45:15,464 --> 00:45:17,464
You've got the whole
next century wrapped up.

704
00:45:17,466 --> 00:45:20,133
I know about Africa. It's seething.
Boom! There it goes.

705
00:45:20,135 --> 00:45:22,836
<i>But it shouldn't stand</i>
in the way of this film.

706
00:45:22,838 --> 00:45:24,771
We're working as a team.

707
00:45:24,773 --> 00:45:27,240
We should put all that
other stuff on the back burner.

708
00:45:27,242 --> 00:45:29,309
Yeah! We can put all "dat"
on the back burner!

709
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:35,582
Let me go in the kitchen
and check on the burner now.

710
00:45:35,584 --> 00:45:37,384
See...

711
00:45:37,386 --> 00:45:40,520
I find that insulting, Ted.
I find that insulting.

712
00:45:40,522 --> 00:45:43,690
I never said you talked like that.
That's why people like Jonas salk...

713
00:45:43,692 --> 00:45:45,759
Think comedians are jerks.

714
00:45:45,761 --> 00:45:48,795
Fine, he's writing that down.
I'll write it too.

715
00:45:48,797 --> 00:45:51,131
"I never said that."

716
00:45:51,133 --> 00:45:54,134
Get that down on paper.
Get a permanent record of that.

717
00:45:54,136 --> 00:45:57,537
Date this.
Now it's all permanent.

718
00:45:57,539 --> 00:46:00,907
That's not what you said!
You said this would be my scene.

719
00:46:00,909 --> 00:46:03,410
- Lisa, we don't have the time. I'm sorry.
- Albert!

720
00:46:03,412 --> 00:46:06,546
I've gotta go. Larry, in here. Let's go.

721
00:46:06,548 --> 00:46:10,317
She's only getting confirmed once.
Honey, it's an emergency.

722
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:12,986
Good luck!
Wait for the guy.

723
00:46:15,991 --> 00:46:18,959
Okay. All right, he's in.
Let's go.

724
00:46:18,961 --> 00:46:21,928
Bye, bye. It's really not
nice to break a promise.

725
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:25,599
Wait a second. Honestly, this is Sunday.
I don't have two crews.

726
00:46:25,601 --> 00:46:27,801
But my dress!
I'm filming your dress.

727
00:46:27,803 --> 00:46:31,137
Get a good shot of her dress.
This isn't fair.

728
00:46:31,139 --> 00:46:34,307
If you have time, when you're
finished come by the church.

729
00:46:34,309 --> 00:46:36,509
We will!
Bye, bye.

730
00:46:36,511 --> 00:46:38,345
You liar!
Bye.

731
00:46:38,347 --> 00:46:40,547
Bye, bye.

732
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:47,220
I feel bad about letting her down.

733
00:46:47,222 --> 00:46:49,289
Don't worry. She's fine.
You made the right decision.

734
00:46:49,291 --> 00:46:52,392
If you pull over for a second... I can
get another crew. I'll make a call.

735
00:46:52,394 --> 00:46:54,527
You did the best you could, really.

736
00:46:54,529 --> 00:46:56,896
You haven't had an emergency
since we've been here.

737
00:46:56,898 --> 00:46:59,733
I haven't had an emergency
in six months. Really?

738
00:46:59,735 --> 00:47:01,468
This is exciting.
Yes, it is.

739
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:04,137
Don't worry about anything.
Everything is under control.

740
00:47:04,139 --> 00:47:06,673
Apparently, a beautiful old <i>show
horse had a heart attack...</i>

741
00:47:06,675 --> 00:47:09,409
<i>In the middle of a parade</i>
in downtown Phoenix.

742
00:47:09,411 --> 00:47:13,947
<i>Without an immediate</i> and delicate bypass
operation, <i>the horse wouldn't make it.</i>

743
00:47:13,949 --> 00:47:17,550
<i>Although yeager had performed</i> this
kind of surgery <i>only once before,</i>

744
00:47:17,552 --> 00:47:21,588
<i>he expressed confidence, and</i>
put the horse's owner at ease.

745
00:47:24,192 --> 00:47:28,561
<i>At 11:30,</i>
preparation for surgery began.

746
00:47:30,599 --> 00:47:32,499
Take it up.

747
00:47:35,771 --> 00:47:38,405
Okay.

748
00:48:14,776 --> 00:48:17,010
Things proceeded smoothly.

749
00:48:17,012 --> 00:48:20,747
<i>At 11:38 the horse was hooked up</i>
to the artificial respirator.

750
00:48:31,226 --> 00:48:34,194
<i>The time was drawing near.</i>

751
00:48:36,798 --> 00:48:38,665
<i>At 11:41...</i>

752
00:48:38,667 --> 00:48:42,068
<i>Yeager and his assistants</i>
had finished their preparation.

753
00:48:42,070 --> 00:48:43,870
<i>We were ready.</i>

754
00:48:43,872 --> 00:48:46,506
<i>You could feel the excitement</i>
in the air as yeager ordered...

755
00:48:47,609 --> 00:48:49,509
<i>The final dosage</i> of anesthetic.

756
00:48:49,511 --> 00:48:52,545
Okay, let's give him two and
a half percent halothane...

757
00:48:52,547 --> 00:48:55,582
And then give me
capillary refill time please.

758
00:49:01,723 --> 00:49:03,590
Two and a half percent.

759
00:49:03,592 --> 00:49:06,459
Refill time:
One second.

760
00:49:06,461 --> 00:49:08,461
Good. That's good.
Okay.

761
00:49:08,463 --> 00:49:10,930
Let's go over our final
checklist, and we're ready.

762
00:49:10,932 --> 00:49:13,166
Respiration?

763
00:49:13,168 --> 00:49:15,168
Six.
<i>Good.</i>

764
00:49:15,170 --> 00:49:19,005
Let me see. Blood pressure? What
was the blood pressure earlier?

765
00:49:19,007 --> 00:49:21,007
<i>One-ten over 60.</i>

766
00:49:21,009 --> 00:49:23,309
What do we have now?

767
00:49:23,311 --> 00:49:26,112
One hundred over 52.

768
00:49:26,114 --> 00:49:30,250
That's perfect.
Okay, let me see. -

769
00:49:30,252 --> 00:49:33,720
check pupil dilation.

770
00:49:33,722 --> 00:49:36,256
Good. Okay.

771
00:49:36,258 --> 00:49:38,858
Color's good.

772
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:40,660
Let's check his pulse.

773
00:49:40,662 --> 00:49:43,696
Okay. This is
dressed properly.

774
00:49:44,866 --> 00:49:48,234
Pulse is 44.
<i>Good. E.K.G.?</i>

775
00:49:48,236 --> 00:49:50,103
<i>Normal.
Okay.</i>

776
00:49:50,105 --> 00:49:53,339
Let's give him the anesthetic,
and we're on our way.

777
00:49:53,341 --> 00:49:56,009
Two and a half percent halothane.

778
00:49:56,011 --> 00:49:59,479
You want another two and a half percent?
Dr. yeager?

779
00:49:59,481 --> 00:50:03,016
What?
Two and a half percent?

780
00:50:03,018 --> 00:50:05,852
Yes.

781
00:50:10,425 --> 00:50:13,693
Dr. yeager, that's five
percent halothane. Five?

782
00:50:13,695 --> 00:50:15,995
No, no, no.
I said two and a half percent.

783
00:50:15,997 --> 00:50:19,065
I heard you order it twice. No. No.

784
00:50:19,067 --> 00:50:22,535
- I couldn't have said that. Two and a half percent.
- You said it twice.

785
00:50:22,537 --> 00:50:24,337
No, that's too much.

786
00:50:24,339 --> 00:50:26,806
- That's too much.
- You ordered it.

787
00:50:26,808 --> 00:50:29,776
I did? Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure.
We got it on the film.

788
00:50:29,778 --> 00:50:31,311
My god!

789
00:50:31,313 --> 00:50:35,415
<i>Wait! Don't panic.</i>

790
00:50:35,417 --> 00:50:37,584
Don't panic.
Do something.

791
00:50:46,661 --> 00:50:48,561
We have no pulse.

792
00:50:49,831 --> 00:50:51,631
Two and a half and
two and a half makes five.

793
00:50:53,301 --> 00:50:56,769
The operation was over at
11:45,

794
00:50:56,771 --> 00:50:58,771
<i>well ahead of schedule.</i>

795
00:50:58,773 --> 00:51:01,274
No.

796
00:51:01,276 --> 00:51:03,776
<i>Dr. yeager took a short break,</i>

797
00:51:03,778 --> 00:51:07,180
<i>and then asked if he could</i>
see me alone in his office.

798
00:51:07,182 --> 00:51:09,249
<i>Of course I obliged.</i>

799
00:51:10,785 --> 00:51:14,821
Quite an ordeal, yes, it was.

800
00:51:14,823 --> 00:51:17,323
Albert, I know we have an agreement,

801
00:51:17,325 --> 00:51:19,893
and probably shouldn't
be asking you this.

802
00:51:19,895 --> 00:51:22,362
But I'd be rather embarrassed
if what just went on in there...

803
00:51:22,364 --> 00:51:24,163
Were included in this movie.

804
00:51:24,165 --> 00:51:26,766
It's not gonna do me
any good at all personally.

805
00:51:26,768 --> 00:51:29,235
People in Phoenix
are gonna see this movie.

806
00:51:29,237 --> 00:51:31,437
I think you're overreacting.

807
00:51:31,439 --> 00:51:35,174
I know what you're saying, but I think
it showed you in a very good light.

808
00:51:35,176 --> 00:51:37,176
It was very interesting.
I appreciate that.

809
00:51:37,178 --> 00:51:40,680
But I'm gonna have to continue to
work here after this film comes out.

810
00:51:40,682 --> 00:51:45,051
I don't know if I owned an animal and I saw me
losing that horse, whether I would trust me.

811
00:51:45,053 --> 00:51:47,887
You know what I'm saying? Yeah,
but I wouldn't worry about it.

812
00:51:47,889 --> 00:51:51,491
You see, people go to doctors
for personal reasons,

813
00:51:51,493 --> 00:51:53,526
and you gave off
something very good in there.

814
00:51:53,528 --> 00:51:55,461
It seems like you did
everything you could.

815
00:51:55,463 --> 00:51:59,732
You just didn't know. You made a mistake.
Everybody makes mistakes.

816
00:51:59,734 --> 00:52:03,169
I don't know people are all that understanding
when it comes to their own pets.

817
00:52:03,171 --> 00:52:05,405
I think they are. I've
had people come to me...

818
00:52:05,407 --> 00:52:09,509
Because somebody else botched up a broken
leg on a dog, for example, and it...

819
00:52:09,511 --> 00:52:11,444
No, I think people
are very understanding.

820
00:52:11,446 --> 00:52:14,013
They've been very bitter about
whomever they've been to before.

821
00:52:14,015 --> 00:52:18,051
This is the worst possible advertising
a person like me could have.

822
00:52:18,053 --> 00:52:20,086
You understand that?
Well, I'll tell you what.

823
00:52:20,088 --> 00:52:22,388
Don't worry about it now.
It's on my mind now.

824
00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:26,292
Forget it now. As far as you're
concerned now, it's out.

825
00:52:28,063 --> 00:52:30,330
You couldn't just sign something
to that effect, could you?

826
00:52:30,332 --> 00:52:34,233
No. I mean, I could, but then
it's gonna be on my mind.

827
00:52:34,235 --> 00:52:36,302
Hello?

828
00:52:36,304 --> 00:52:39,138
No one's in here.

829
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:42,308
Dr. yeager?

830
00:52:42,310 --> 00:52:47,280
What the hell's goin' on here?

831
00:52:47,282 --> 00:52:49,549
Hello?
Anybody home?

832
00:52:49,551 --> 00:52:51,651
Could you at least give me
some kind of assurance...

833
00:52:51,653 --> 00:52:54,854
That this won't be the only time in
the movie you'll see me working?

834
00:52:54,856 --> 00:52:57,857
Can you show me saving
all those cats and dogs?

835
00:52:57,859 --> 00:53:01,127
<i>Come on, will ya?</i>
Remember the old saying:

836
00:53:01,129 --> 00:53:04,063
"To err is human;
To film divine."

837
00:53:04,065 --> 00:53:06,065
No, it was very good.

838
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:13,840
What happened?
We lost her.

839
00:53:13,842 --> 00:53:15,842
You lost her?
I'm sorry.

840
00:53:15,844 --> 00:53:17,844
How could you lose her?
I'm really sorry.

841
00:53:17,846 --> 00:53:21,114
Don't you have people here
who stay with the animals?

842
00:53:21,116 --> 00:53:24,517
Let's get the damn hell
out of here and find her.

843
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:32,525
That was just the beginning
<i>of what was to be a bad time...</i>

844
00:53:32,527 --> 00:53:35,028
<i>In the yeagers' lives.</i>

845
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:38,264
<i>On Wednesday Mrs. yeager</i>
was informed...

846
00:53:38,266 --> 00:53:41,501
<i>That her grandmother</i>
passed away from the stroke.

847
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:43,870
<i>The funeral took place</i> two days later,

848
00:53:43,872 --> 00:53:46,339
<i>and we were graciously allowed</i>
to film it.

849
00:53:46,341 --> 00:53:49,509
Through Jesus Christ,
our lord. Amen.

850
00:53:49,511 --> 00:53:53,112
"Jesus said, 'i am
the resurrection and the life.

851
00:53:53,114 --> 00:53:56,149
'He that believeth in me,
though he were dead... '"

852
00:53:56,151 --> 00:54:00,153
I hate to keep harping on this, but I
can't concentrate on my work anymore.

853
00:54:00,155 --> 00:54:04,791
I've never killed an animal that size.

854
00:54:04,793 --> 00:54:07,660
This isn't the place.
We'll talk about it later.

855
00:54:07,662 --> 00:54:10,830
Honey, this is the place.
I'm upset, you're upset.

856
00:54:10,832 --> 00:54:13,666
What if he uses that scene?

857
00:54:13,668 --> 00:54:18,404
Could you stop talking about that movie
for one minute? What's the matter?

858
00:54:18,406 --> 00:54:22,308
What's the matter? Look up there.
That's my grandmother.

859
00:54:22,310 --> 00:54:25,678
I realize that, but what's gonna
happen when the kids go to school...

860
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:29,348
And their friends say, "hey, did
your dad really kill that horse"?

861
00:54:29,350 --> 00:54:32,952
What are the kids gonna say? What are
the kids gonna tell their friends?

862
00:54:32,954 --> 00:54:36,155
If I could have your undivided attention.

863
00:54:36,157 --> 00:54:40,259
I'm sure you'll feel better
after this is over.

864
00:54:40,261 --> 00:54:42,495
<i>Let us pray.</i>
Almighty god...

865
00:54:42,497 --> 00:54:46,365
Things got worse.
<i>The following week was...</i>

866
00:54:46,367 --> 00:54:50,236
<i>One of the most depressing</i> periods I
had experienced <i>since early childhood.</i>

867
00:54:50,238 --> 00:54:53,272
<i>The entire family</i> was now grief stricken.

868
00:54:53,274 --> 00:54:55,074
<i>She with her grandmother,</i>

869
00:54:55,076 --> 00:54:58,111
<i>he with the grandmother</i> and the animal.

870
00:55:06,554 --> 00:55:09,856
<i>Day after day</i> was the same.

871
00:55:11,025 --> 00:55:12,625
<i>Lifeless.</i>

872
00:55:12,627 --> 00:55:16,496
<i>Dr. yeager would sleep sometimes</i>
for 18 hours straight.

873
00:55:18,199 --> 00:55:21,667
<i>As a filmmaker I was frustrated.</i>
I wanted to help.

874
00:55:21,669 --> 00:55:25,138
Dr. yeager?

875
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:27,907
An exhibition of paintings
by navajo children...

876
00:55:27,909 --> 00:55:30,910
Will be on display throughout the month.

877
00:55:30,912 --> 00:55:32,311
Dr. yeager?

878
00:55:36,484 --> 00:55:38,484
Hello?

879
00:55:38,486 --> 00:55:41,587
Jeanette?
It's Albert.

880
00:55:41,589 --> 00:55:44,757
Hi. Well, I know that you two...

881
00:55:44,759 --> 00:55:47,994
Have been very depressed, and...

882
00:55:47,996 --> 00:55:50,296
Well, I've been avoiding you.

883
00:55:50,298 --> 00:55:53,332
I don't know if you're aware of it,
but I have for a couple of weeks...

884
00:55:53,334 --> 00:55:56,002
'Cause I didn't think
we should be getting involved.

885
00:55:56,004 --> 00:55:58,104
And now I'm beginning to think...

886
00:55:58,106 --> 00:56:02,308
That if I can help you, maybe
you can help everybody else.

887
00:56:02,310 --> 00:56:05,912
So... what am I trying to say?
You wanna have dinner with me?

888
00:56:05,914 --> 00:56:07,914
A snack?
You wanna...

889
00:56:07,916 --> 00:56:10,449
Dinner?
Well, I mean, look.

890
00:56:10,451 --> 00:56:14,954
I thought about that scene we had at the
shopping center. It was a good scene.

891
00:56:14,956 --> 00:56:17,857
It was nice action.
And we talked.

892
00:56:17,859 --> 00:56:21,060
That's more than anyone else
is doing right now, so...

893
00:56:21,062 --> 00:56:24,664
I mean, maybe...
I don't know. Come on over.

894
00:56:24,666 --> 00:56:27,333
Albert, I feel badly about that day.

895
00:56:27,335 --> 00:56:30,036
I'm still a little embarrassed
about that.

896
00:56:30,038 --> 00:56:34,574
- I think that what you said there was right.
- What did I say?

897
00:56:34,576 --> 00:56:39,011
You said about you not being any
better than what I already have.

898
00:56:39,013 --> 00:56:43,149
- I said that?
- I think you were right.

899
00:56:43,151 --> 00:56:45,184
Come on, get serious.

900
00:56:45,186 --> 00:56:48,788
I have to make this work or I'm not
gonna have any respect for myself.

901
00:56:48,790 --> 00:56:54,293
- You know what I mean?
- I see. Okay.

902
00:56:54,295 --> 00:56:57,997
Albert, this has nothing to do with you.

903
00:56:57,999 --> 00:56:59,966
It's between Warren and me.

904
00:56:59,968 --> 00:57:02,301
You hate me then, now, right?

905
00:57:02,303 --> 00:57:04,470
No, no.

906
00:57:04,472 --> 00:57:08,641
I think you're very nice. Nice. Okay.
You do what you have to do.

907
00:57:08,643 --> 00:57:12,912
Just talk, though. Work it
out with language. It helps.

908
00:57:12,914 --> 00:57:17,583
I'm not d.W. Griffith. I'm gonna get
in big trouble if there's no dialogue.

909
00:57:17,585 --> 00:57:20,119
We will.
Okay. Promise?

910
00:57:20,121 --> 00:57:22,255
It's going to get better.
Great.

911
00:57:23,691 --> 00:57:25,625
It didn't.

912
00:57:25,627 --> 00:57:28,794
<i>The following Saturday, Jeanette</i>
invited some friends over...

913
00:57:28,796 --> 00:57:31,631
<i>For a barbecue.</i>

914
00:57:31,633 --> 00:57:35,601
<i>She set the table,</i> he set the mood.

915
00:57:40,375 --> 00:57:42,174
<i>I couldn't take it anymore.</i>

916
00:57:42,176 --> 00:57:44,343
<i>I had decided</i> that was it!

917
00:57:44,345 --> 00:57:46,579
<i>These people</i> had been depressed...

918
00:57:46,581 --> 00:57:48,381
<i>Long enough.</i>

919
00:57:48,383 --> 00:57:51,984
Hello?

920
00:58:02,063 --> 00:58:04,830
Where are the kids? They went to school.
Lisa had a test.

921
00:58:07,435 --> 00:58:09,402
Went with Lisa.

922
00:58:09,404 --> 00:58:12,905
Well, look, this was just a very
serious attempt to cheer everybody up.

923
00:58:12,907 --> 00:58:14,807
But I needed the kids.
It was really for them.

924
00:58:14,809 --> 00:58:17,610
I'll come back when they're home.
Albert, please come in.

925
00:58:17,612 --> 00:58:20,846
We're just talking here. Please come in.
But I did this...

926
00:58:20,848 --> 00:58:23,416
I'll come back when the kids are home.
I understand. Please come in.

927
00:58:23,418 --> 00:58:27,086
No, come on. I gotta shower.
Let me shower.

928
00:58:27,088 --> 00:58:30,656
Albert, please. Okay, we'll come in.
Okay, okay, okay. Hi.

929
00:58:30,658 --> 00:58:33,693
- Hi.
- No, I gotta go home. Come on.

930
00:58:33,695 --> 00:58:36,228
Please. I'd really
appreciate it. Please.

931
00:58:36,230 --> 00:58:39,098
Just sit down for a moment. Thank you.
All right, okay. Okay.

932
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:41,033
How are you?

933
00:58:42,737 --> 00:58:45,071
You want a cup of coffee? No, no.

934
00:58:47,875 --> 00:58:49,742
Hi.

935
00:58:51,746 --> 00:58:57,616
Well, I'm sure you know that...
We're upset.

937
00:58:57,618 --> 00:58:59,485
What, are you kidding me?

938
00:58:59,487 --> 00:59:03,089
That's why I rented this whole outfit.
"You didn't rent me."

939
00:59:03,091 --> 00:59:05,624
Bunny, we're talking seriously now.
Albert, wait.

940
00:59:05,626 --> 00:59:08,094
Now, I don't know <i>too much about it,</i>

941
00:59:08,096 --> 00:59:12,298
but I feel like I'm having
a nervous breakdown.

942
00:59:13,434 --> 00:59:15,701
No!

943
00:59:15,703 --> 00:59:19,372
Don't act like that.
Come on.

944
00:59:19,374 --> 00:59:22,241
The best thing you can do
is just to relax.

945
00:59:22,243 --> 00:59:25,244
See, when you feel this way, you clam up.

946
00:59:25,246 --> 00:59:28,314
That's no good.

947
00:59:29,984 --> 00:59:34,053
I understand there's
been a couple of deaths.

948
00:59:34,055 --> 00:59:35,755
So what?

949
00:59:35,757 --> 00:59:39,392
Look. I haven't gotten used
to this whole process myself.

950
00:59:39,394 --> 00:59:43,896
I cried the other night.

951
00:59:43,898 --> 00:59:45,464
About what? I don't remember.

952
00:59:45,466 --> 00:59:49,068
See? I'm mixed up too.
I just don't clam up.

953
00:59:49,070 --> 00:59:52,138
Look.

954
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:54,640
There's a big meeting coming
up at the end of this month.

955
00:59:54,642 --> 00:59:57,710
You know, with the institute and
the people from the studio.

956
00:59:57,712 --> 00:59:59,512
The one we're not invited to?

957
00:59:59,514 --> 01:00:02,114
"I can't go either."
That's right, he can't.

958
01:00:02,116 --> 01:00:04,550
Why don't I see if I can call it earlier?

959
01:00:04,552 --> 01:00:08,220
Maybe tomorrow or Wednesday
if they can get down here.

960
01:00:08,222 --> 01:00:11,524
I don't know exactly what to
tell you, but these people do.

961
01:00:11,526 --> 01:00:14,593
They're scientists.
That's their business.

962
01:00:14,595 --> 01:00:17,863
If you'd listen to me, though,
I think you'd feel better.

963
01:00:17,865 --> 01:00:21,434
Just get it out.
Don't internalize.

964
01:00:21,436 --> 01:00:26,772
Talk to anybody, a neighbor.
Talk to an animal.

965
01:00:26,774 --> 01:00:29,475
Really, Warren.

966
01:00:29,477 --> 01:00:31,343
Trust me.

967
01:00:33,047 --> 01:00:35,681
We called the meeting <i>for Wednesday.</i>

968
01:00:35,683 --> 01:00:40,553
<i>These monthly feedback</i> and input sessions
were crucial <i>to the success of this project.</i>

969
01:00:40,555 --> 01:00:44,323
<i>For the institute,</i> this was the time
to provide <i>analysis and guidance,</i>

970
01:00:44,325 --> 01:00:46,525
<i>based on the footage</i> they were viewing.

971
01:00:46,527 --> 01:00:50,096
<i>For the studio,</i> this was the time
to <i>discuss financial matters,</i>

972
01:00:50,098 --> 01:00:53,199
<i>personnel problems,</i>
and other cinematic details.

973
01:00:53,201 --> 01:00:57,670
<i>This was Dr. Jeremy noland,</i> project
coordinator <i>for the institute,</i>

974
01:00:57,672 --> 01:00:59,705
<i>an ambitious man.</i>

975
01:00:59,707 --> 01:01:03,943
<i>Dr. Ann Kramer,</i> a good psychologist,
<i>generally a nice person.</i>

976
01:01:03,945 --> 01:01:05,945
<i>I think she liked me.</i>

977
01:01:05,947 --> 01:01:09,248
<i>Dr. hill was there,</i>
Dr. cleary,

978
01:01:09,250 --> 01:01:13,586
<i>and Martin brand,</i> the studio
executive <i>in charge of this picture.</i>

979
01:01:13,588 --> 01:01:18,090
<i>Brand took this project over</i> from
a younger man <i>who was fired.</i>

980
01:01:18,092 --> 01:01:20,092
<i>Martin was used to</i> the old Hollywood...

981
01:01:20,094 --> 01:01:21,627
<i>With its big stars</i> and lavish sets.

982
01:01:21,629 --> 01:01:24,130
<i>He didn't know</i> what we were doing here.

983
01:01:24,132 --> 01:01:29,101
<i>I guess that's why</i> he felt it was
unnecessary <i>to actually come to Phoenix.</i>

984
01:01:29,103 --> 01:01:33,772
So, we've taken voiceprints
from day 12 to day 18,

985
01:01:33,774 --> 01:01:37,543
compared them against the prints of these same
people from the first week of the project,

986
01:01:37,545 --> 01:01:40,880
and no matter which way we computed
them, they came out the same.

987
01:01:40,882 --> 01:01:45,518
Now, these people are definitely operating
differently now than when filming started.

988
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:47,987
There are changes in all
four voiceprint patterns,

989
01:01:47,989 --> 01:01:51,590
and the extent of these changes is
confirmed by changes in body temperature,

990
01:01:51,592 --> 01:01:53,926
as revealed by the infrared
analysis of the film.

991
01:01:53,928 --> 01:01:56,595
Now, each of us may have a different
explanation for what's going on here,

992
01:01:56,597 --> 01:02:00,499
<i>but it's undeniable that</i> you've strongly
altered <i>the reality you're filming.</i>

993
01:02:00,501 --> 01:02:04,403
In my opinion, you're getting
a false reality here,

994
01:02:04,405 --> 01:02:07,139
and I don't know what
you're gonna do about it.

995
01:02:07,141 --> 01:02:09,775
Me? Wait a second.

996
01:02:09,777 --> 01:02:12,778
I-I'd like to get back to something
Ann said a little earlier.

997
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:16,015
You said you think I look heavier
now than when the filming started.

998
01:02:16,017 --> 01:02:18,350
Where would that be? In the cheeks?
<i>No, no.</i>

999
01:02:18,352 --> 01:02:21,253
I said that in some of the later
footage, you look somewhat fatigued.

1000
01:02:21,255 --> 01:02:23,255
I see. That's all right.
Not fat, fatigued.

1001
01:02:23,257 --> 01:02:25,958
I've been up a lot. Fatigued is
okay, but heavy's another thing.

1002
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:29,195
'Cause I eat raw vegetables. There's
no reason I should... Mr. Brooks.

1003
01:02:29,197 --> 01:02:31,197
Yes? Okay. You look fine.

1004
01:02:31,199 --> 01:02:34,233
Now I'd like, if we
could, to go to day four.

1005
01:02:34,235 --> 01:02:36,902
I believe that's, scene 31.

1006
01:02:38,706 --> 01:02:43,108
Now here's some footage
I'd like to show you.

1007
01:02:43,110 --> 01:02:45,778
Lights.
What?

1008
01:02:45,780 --> 01:02:47,813
What did you say? Lights.

1009
01:02:47,815 --> 01:02:50,616
No. See, this is my home.
It's not a projection room.

1010
01:02:50,618 --> 01:02:53,419
If you'd say, "would you like to turn
the lights off?" I'd say, "sure."

1011
01:02:53,421 --> 01:02:57,923
"Lights," he says.
Man lives in the kitchen?

1012
01:02:59,727 --> 01:03:02,928
Now, we've blown up
what I want to show you,

1013
01:03:02,930 --> 01:03:06,565
and I'm gonna keep repeating it, because
it's hard to catch the first time.

1014
01:03:06,567 --> 01:03:08,968
In fact, the computer didn't
catch it till the second run.

1015
01:03:08,970 --> 01:03:11,537
When we started filming <i>Warren yeager,</i>

1016
01:03:11,539 --> 01:03:15,975
<i>he was drinking coffee with his</i> right hand only,
no assistance <i>at all from his left hand...</i>

1017
01:03:15,977 --> 01:03:18,444
<i>As distinctive a trait</i> as handwriting.

1018
01:03:18,446 --> 01:03:22,014
<i>Now watch again.</i>
Right hand only.

1019
01:03:24,018 --> 01:03:26,085
<i>That's it.</i>

1020
01:03:27,021 --> 01:03:31,357
<i>Now, on day 13,</i>

1021
01:03:31,359 --> 01:03:34,193
<i>he starts drinking coffee</i>
with both his hands.

1022
01:03:34,195 --> 01:03:38,697
<i>Now watch the decision.</i>
There! Now watch again.

1023
01:03:38,699 --> 01:03:40,499
What?

1024
01:03:40,501 --> 01:03:43,102
Watch the decision. There!

1025
01:03:43,104 --> 01:03:46,338
<i>See? He's much less relying</i>
on his entire right side.

1026
01:03:46,340 --> 01:03:48,374
Come on!

1027
01:03:48,376 --> 01:03:50,943
Yes, it's conceivable
<i>that within two months...</i>

1028
01:03:50,945 --> 01:03:53,178
<i>He will have shifted the cup</i>
entirely to his left hand,

1029
01:03:53,180 --> 01:03:56,615
<i>and his right hand</i> will remain unused
<i>throughout the entire gesture.</i>

1030
01:03:56,617 --> 01:03:59,285
Total change <i>in body language.</i>

1031
01:03:59,287 --> 01:04:01,153
Lights.

1032
01:04:05,693 --> 01:04:08,527
Very interesting.
I hadn't noticed it at all.

1033
01:04:08,529 --> 01:04:11,397
Well, wait a minute. I mean,
this cup could've been hot.

1034
01:04:11,399 --> 01:04:13,866
Nope. The infrared
analysis of the film...

1035
01:04:13,868 --> 01:04:17,403
Shows no difference in the
effective temperature of the dish.

1036
01:04:17,405 --> 01:04:20,039
Albert, may I interrupt
for one minute, please?

1037
01:04:20,041 --> 01:04:23,609
People aren't gonna walk out of a
theater saying, "I don't like that guy",

1038
01:04:23,611 --> 01:04:26,278
the guy who holds the cup with
one hand, with two hands."

1039
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:29,915
Absolutely. <i>I'll tell you what they
do have</i> a good chance of saying.

1040
01:04:29,917 --> 01:04:33,819
"Where the hell is Paul Newman?
Where's redford? Where's Nicholson?"

1041
01:04:33,821 --> 01:04:36,255
Jesus. <i>Believe me, they prefer</i>
Nicholson with the cup...

1042
01:04:36,257 --> 01:04:38,957
<i>Than the cup</i> with the other guy.

1043
01:04:38,959 --> 01:04:43,095
<i>Albert, so you keep yeager in,</i> but you gotta
get somebody <i>in the movie, for Christ's sake.</i>

1044
01:04:43,097 --> 01:04:46,632
<i>You maybe oughta add</i> a next-door
neighbor, <i>or a boss, or a cleaning lady,</i>

1045
01:04:46,634 --> 01:04:49,034
<i>somebody with a name,</i> somebody
who'd draw <i>some people.</i>

1046
01:04:49,036 --> 01:04:51,270
<i>You've got rock friends.</i>

1047
01:04:51,272 --> 01:04:54,707
Would it be so bad to have Neil diamond
sitting in a meeting like this? Schmuck!

1048
01:04:54,709 --> 01:04:59,178
<i>You'll make a hell of a lot more</i> money with Neil
diamond in there than with the guy with the cup!

1049
01:04:59,180 --> 01:05:02,514
Could we get back on the track? I
need someone to get that cup for me.

1050
01:05:02,516 --> 01:05:05,284
Stop with the cup! Really,
I can't hear this anymore.

1051
01:05:05,286 --> 01:05:07,252
I-I don't know what
you're talking about.

1052
01:05:07,254 --> 01:05:09,588
Explain to me in english, please.
All right.

1053
01:05:09,590 --> 01:05:14,393
Quite simply, the filming has triggered a drastic
emotional change in these people's lives.

1054
01:05:14,395 --> 01:05:17,563
They don't know how to deal with it, and
you don't know how to deal with it.

1055
01:05:17,565 --> 01:05:19,865
And that's bad? I don't live
in a world of good and bad.

1056
01:05:19,867 --> 01:05:22,034
I don't talk that language.

1057
01:05:22,036 --> 01:05:24,770
<i>I think we're building</i> a lot of
conclusions on <i>a little bit of evidence.</i>

1058
01:05:24,772 --> 01:05:28,006
Maybe what these people are going through
is growth. Maybe it's inevitable.

1059
01:05:28,008 --> 01:05:31,076
<i>And healthy. Absolutely right.
Howard's right.</i>

1060
01:05:31,078 --> 01:05:34,012
Excuse me. I would like
to hear from Dr. cleary.

1061
01:05:34,014 --> 01:05:36,949
Do you really want to know what I think?
Yes, please.

1062
01:05:36,951 --> 01:05:38,984
Okay.

1063
01:05:38,986 --> 01:05:42,688
One, we get out of these people's lives.
We must get out of this house.

1064
01:05:42,690 --> 01:05:45,824
- Wait a minute.
- I'm not through.

1065
01:05:45,826 --> 01:05:48,627
We go away at night.
We film only when scheduled.

1066
01:05:48,629 --> 01:05:51,196
We give them some privacy
and stability...

1067
01:05:51,198 --> 01:05:54,733
So that when they wake up in the morning,
they don't think that they're on a movie set!

1068
01:05:54,735 --> 01:05:58,237
A movie set. Martin, tell him how
different this is from a movie set.

1069
01:05:58,239 --> 01:06:00,672
On a movie set, you got
actors that are well-known.

1070
01:06:00,674 --> 01:06:04,143
If they give you trouble, you call their
agents and you put some heat under their ass.

1071
01:06:04,145 --> 01:06:07,045
Thanks. Look, Ted, there's no
reason to get out of this house.

1072
01:06:07,047 --> 01:06:10,749
I spent a lot in purchasing it, and a
lot in decorating it. It's unnecessary.

1073
01:06:10,751 --> 01:06:13,252
It is very necessary.
<i>It's not necessary.</i>

1074
01:06:13,254 --> 01:06:16,188
You know how difficult it is to get
wallpaper? <i>How difficult is it?</i>

1075
01:06:16,190 --> 01:06:18,590
It's very difficult!
This is Phoenix!

1076
01:06:18,592 --> 01:06:21,927
We're talking about people's lives, and
you're talking about your damn wallpaper!

1077
01:06:21,929 --> 01:06:25,197
You know you spend 80% of
your life looking at walls?

1078
01:06:25,199 --> 01:06:27,399
Gentlemen, please.

1079
01:06:27,401 --> 01:06:29,535
I went to L.A.
for that wallpaper!

1080
01:06:29,537 --> 01:06:32,171
<i>- The reason...
- Wait a minute. May I...</i>

1081
01:06:32,173 --> 01:06:35,774
May I make a suggestion that might break
this logjam? Who invited you in the bedroom?

1082
01:06:35,776 --> 01:06:37,776
Mr. Brooks, please? What?

1083
01:06:37,778 --> 01:06:40,345
The institute has a center
up in the foothills...

1084
01:06:40,347 --> 01:06:43,949
That's used for encounter and therapy sessions,
mainly for our executives and clients.

1085
01:06:43,951 --> 01:06:47,219
But I think we should consider taking
the yeagers up there for a weekend.

1086
01:06:47,221 --> 01:06:49,021
I think they'll open up again.

1087
01:06:49,023 --> 01:06:51,623
Yes. You mean like Echelon?
Like hot tubs?

1088
01:06:51,625 --> 01:06:53,759
Nature trails, massage. Absolutely!

1089
01:06:53,761 --> 01:06:56,161
See? That's somethin'
I can use! Great.

1090
01:06:56,163 --> 01:06:59,565
<i>Thank you. Are you crazy? You wanna
fly all these people to Colorado?</i>

1091
01:06:59,567 --> 01:07:01,834
What?
Why don't you just put 'em all on drugs?

1092
01:07:01,836 --> 01:07:05,270
Give them psychiatrists. Enroll them all
in private schools while you're at it.

1093
01:07:05,272 --> 01:07:07,906
Just a minute!
We got a budget!

1094
01:07:07,908 --> 01:07:11,143
<i>Remember the costs,</i> Dr. clearson.
<i>Please remember the costs.</i>

1095
01:07:11,145 --> 01:07:13,745
Yeah.
Costs.

1096
01:07:13,747 --> 01:07:16,148
You spend a half a million
dollars on research.

1097
01:07:16,150 --> 01:07:20,652
I don't think you've spent a dime finding
a qualified person to head this project.

1098
01:07:22,022 --> 01:07:24,389
You've got someone
at the controls of a 747...

1099
01:07:24,391 --> 01:07:26,458
Who's never even flown as a passenger.

1100
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:28,293
That was <i>airport '76.</i>

1101
01:07:28,295 --> 01:07:30,796
Ted, I think I've logged more miles...

1102
01:07:30,798 --> 01:07:32,931
Than you and your entire
university put together.

1103
01:07:32,933 --> 01:07:35,200
- You're missing the point.
- I'm not missing the point.

1104
01:07:35,202 --> 01:07:37,903
I'm a million-miler. You know what
that means? I'll show you my pin.

1105
01:07:37,905 --> 01:07:40,339
I can get into any v.I.P.
Lounge in this country, Ted.

1106
01:07:40,341 --> 01:07:43,542
I knock on the door, I tell 'em my name,
give 'em the pin number, sit in the lounge.

1107
01:07:43,544 --> 01:07:46,478
<i>I can drink coffee and eat their</i> doughnuts,
and I don't even have to be flying anywhere.

1108
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:48,914
<i>How many people do you know</i>
who can do that,

1109
01:07:48,916 --> 01:07:52,417
<i>how many people can go down</i> to an airport
lounge and say, <i>"let me in, I just wanna sit"?</i>

1110
01:07:52,419 --> 01:07:54,353
<i>I can do that, Ted,</i> in O'Hare airport.

1111
01:07:54,355 --> 01:07:56,889
<i>I've taken a date there</i> after a movie.

1112
01:07:56,891 --> 01:07:59,625
Just sat and had coffee in the lounge,
and I wasn't even flying anywhere!

1113
01:07:59,627 --> 01:08:01,727
Missing your point! Albert, Albert.

1114
01:08:01,729 --> 01:08:04,630
Ted, come on. I-i feel what
we need now is a break.

1115
01:08:04,632 --> 01:08:06,765
I'm starving. Can we eat? Great idea.

1116
01:08:06,767 --> 01:08:09,501
I know a great Mexican-like restaurant.
I'll treat, okay?

1117
01:08:09,503 --> 01:08:11,637
"We're just getti" all cooped up here.

1118
01:08:11,639 --> 01:08:14,506
All right, Albert, I'm gonna hang up now.
Okay, Martin.

1119
01:08:14,508 --> 01:08:16,575
I wanna leave you with two words. Yeah?

1120
01:08:16,577 --> 01:08:19,678
James caan. Is that real enough for you?

1121
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:22,781
<i>That's great.</i>
Bye-bye.

1122
01:08:22,783 --> 01:08:25,651
Come on, Ted. Albert, Albert.

1123
01:08:25,653 --> 01:08:28,620
Can I speak to you a second?
Come on, let's go eat.

1124
01:08:28,622 --> 01:08:30,989
Could you sit down for a minute?

1125
01:08:30,991 --> 01:08:32,891
Sure.

1126
01:08:34,929 --> 01:08:38,263
My association with
this project has ended.

1127
01:08:39,767 --> 01:08:43,535
<i>I'm leaving Phoenix</i> as soon as I can.

1128
01:08:43,537 --> 01:08:47,339
Why? 'Cause we just
had a little tiff?

1129
01:08:47,341 --> 01:08:50,142
Come on, Ted. Come out and eat.
You'll feel better.

1130
01:08:50,144 --> 01:08:53,011
No,<i>you'll feel better. Eating
doesn't do that for me.</i>

1131
01:08:53,013 --> 01:08:55,714
We're not the same person. I'm
gonna have to disagree with you.

1132
01:08:56,750 --> 01:08:58,750
I think we're very much alike.

1133
01:08:58,752 --> 01:09:00,719
See, that's why we can get
into these kind of debates.

1134
01:09:00,721 --> 01:09:03,121
I think you'd be surprised at
how much alike we really are.

1135
01:09:03,123 --> 01:09:06,291
I'd be more than surprised.
I'd be suicidal.

1136
01:09:06,293 --> 01:09:08,293
Good luck to you.

1137
01:09:08,295 --> 01:09:11,897
Ted, may I ask a personal question?

1138
01:09:11,899 --> 01:09:15,434
Don't you like the accommodations?
Do you want a suite?

1139
01:09:15,436 --> 01:09:17,603
Really, sometimes two rooms
can make a big difference.

1140
01:09:17,605 --> 01:09:19,938
You read in one and sleep in the other.

1141
01:09:19,940 --> 01:09:23,241
I know what a single can do. It can get
depressing. I can take care of it.

1142
01:09:23,243 --> 01:09:25,811
You amaze me, truly. Well, thank you.

1143
01:09:25,813 --> 01:09:28,180
But what about the <i>journal
of</i> American psychology?

1144
01:09:28,182 --> 01:09:30,215
It's just possible if you leave now,

1145
01:09:30,217 --> 01:09:32,851
the <i>journal may not be thrilled
with a half-assed job.</i>

1146
01:09:32,853 --> 01:09:36,388
<i>The journal of</i> American psychology?
Are you kidding?

1147
01:09:36,390 --> 01:09:39,324
Their field is science, not buffoonery.

1148
01:09:39,326 --> 01:09:41,326
You take care, you hear?

1149
01:09:41,328 --> 01:09:43,729
What do you mean
their field is science, Ted?

1150
01:09:43,731 --> 01:09:45,731
Wait a minute, Ted!
Come back!

1151
01:09:45,733 --> 01:09:48,433
If their field is science,
what do you think this is?

1152
01:09:48,435 --> 01:09:51,336
Look, Ted!
This is science!

1153
01:09:51,338 --> 01:09:53,538
What is the institute?
Dry cereal, Ted?

1154
01:09:53,540 --> 01:09:55,607
Come back!
Science! Look!

1155
01:09:55,609 --> 01:09:58,844
It's all science!

1156
01:09:58,846 --> 01:10:01,413
Ted, come back!

1157
01:10:05,185 --> 01:10:07,252
Ted?

1158
01:10:14,061 --> 01:10:15,994
I was upset...

1159
01:10:15,996 --> 01:10:18,964
By Dr. cleary's
sudden departure.

1160
01:10:19,867 --> 01:10:21,900
All right!

1161
01:10:21,902 --> 01:10:24,670
But it turned out to be
<i>a blessing in disguise.</i>

1162
01:10:24,672 --> 01:10:27,773
We're gonna need some help. Larry,
don't worry about filming that.

1163
01:10:27,775 --> 01:10:31,643
<i>I think the pressure</i> of the journal
<i>was just</i> too much for everyone.

1164
01:10:31,645 --> 01:10:34,079
Yeah, put it in your living room.

1165
01:10:34,081 --> 01:10:37,783
<i>Given a little time and help</i>
from his wife and family,

1166
01:10:37,785 --> 01:10:41,486
<i>Dr. yeager started</i>
to come out of his shell.

1167
01:10:41,488 --> 01:10:44,589
<i>I was grateful,</i>
and I wanted him to know it.

1168
01:10:44,591 --> 01:10:49,061
Wait. Larry, we're gonna need some help,
okay? We'll get help in a second.

1169
01:10:49,063 --> 01:10:52,230
I feel guilty about taking it.
No, don't feel guilty.

1170
01:10:52,232 --> 01:10:55,333
Someone gave it to me. I can't use it.
What am I gonna do, throw it away?

1171
01:10:55,335 --> 01:10:58,070
Why can't you use it? It's very
expensive, very expensive.

1172
01:10:58,072 --> 01:11:00,405
I know, I know. Why don't you use it?
Well, it's just...

1173
01:11:00,407 --> 01:11:03,141
I'm in the business, you know?
And it's too big for me.

1174
01:11:03,143 --> 01:11:05,210
It just makes me insecure
to see a TV that big.

1175
01:11:05,212 --> 01:11:07,412
But you can get anything on it.
Yeah, football.

1176
01:11:07,414 --> 01:11:10,849
You like football? The ball
comes right into your room,

1177
01:11:10,851 --> 01:11:13,185
you like to go to the football games?
Yes, I do.

1178
01:11:13,187 --> 01:11:15,053
Open up for me.
Season tickets.

1179
01:11:15,055 --> 01:11:17,522
You'll do good. You'll love this thing.
I love it.

1180
01:11:17,524 --> 01:11:20,726
It's very expensive. I know. Thank you.
Thanks a million.

1181
01:11:20,728 --> 01:11:23,695
Okay, okay.
Help. We need help.

1182
01:11:25,699 --> 01:11:28,033
Well, the storm had passed.

1183
01:11:28,035 --> 01:11:32,104
<i>By the middle of February,</i> my
filmmaking dream <i>had come true.</i>

1184
01:11:32,106 --> 01:11:35,307
<i>I had a happy family,</i> a beautiful city...

1185
01:11:35,309 --> 01:11:40,011
<i>And a chance to show the French</i>
what a montage was all about.

1186
01:14:24,645 --> 01:14:26,044
<i>And then,</i> something happened.

1187
01:14:27,881 --> 01:14:31,416
<i>Still moving at</i> a leisurely pace,
<i>the yeagers were shocked...</i>

1188
01:14:31,418 --> 01:14:34,586
<i>When they picked up the Sunday</i>
edition of the Arizona Republic,

1189
01:14:34,588 --> 01:14:36,821
<i>dated February 19th.</i>

1190
01:14:36,823 --> 01:14:38,690
<i>On page one of part "b"...</i>

1191
01:14:38,692 --> 01:14:42,427
<i>Was the first in a series of</i>
five articles from a new book.

1192
01:14:42,429 --> 01:14:45,797
<i>The book was called
nightmare in the desert.</i>

1193
01:14:45,799 --> 01:14:48,566
<i>Its author,</i>
Dr. Theodore cleary.

1194
01:14:48,568 --> 01:14:50,902
<i>Apparently, cleary took</i>
his notes from the journal...

1195
01:14:50,904 --> 01:14:53,138
<i>And decided to make</i> the fast buck.

1196
01:14:53,140 --> 01:14:55,607
<i>Stringing together a bunch</i>
of familiar catchphrases...

1197
01:14:55,609 --> 01:14:58,243
<i>Like "mind control"</i>
and "psychological rape,"

1198
01:14:58,245 --> 01:15:00,578
<i>he wrote one of</i> those quickie books,

1199
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:03,682
<i>the kind you peddle</i> to the publishers
who <i>missed out on Watergate.</i>

1200
01:15:03,684 --> 01:15:07,319
Howard, please don't come into
my house and read crap, okay?

1201
01:15:07,321 --> 01:15:09,721
If you want to do it, stay at the hotel.

1202
01:15:09,723 --> 01:15:12,390
Albert, you oughta read this, really.

1203
01:15:12,392 --> 01:15:14,993
Ask any great entertainer.
They don't read bad reviews.

1204
01:15:14,995 --> 01:15:18,063
"Out of sight, out of
mind." Jolson said it.

1205
01:15:19,666 --> 01:15:22,067
He...
He says you're dangerous.

1206
01:15:22,069 --> 01:15:24,903
They called babe Ruth dangerous,

1207
01:15:25,973 --> 01:15:27,672
he also says you're paranoid.

1208
01:15:27,674 --> 01:15:29,674
They called babe Ruth paranoid, too.

1209
01:15:29,676 --> 01:15:32,677
I'm making a special breakfast. If
you want to eat it, no reading.

1210
01:15:35,882 --> 01:15:38,249
- Hello?
- Hi. Did you read it?

1211
01:15:38,251 --> 01:15:40,485
Hi, mitz.
I'm reading it now.

1212
01:15:40,487 --> 01:15:42,821
What do they mean, you're like
prisoners of war? I don't know yet.

1213
01:15:42,823 --> 01:15:47,158
I wanna finish reading. I'll call you back.
What's going on over there?

1214
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:49,627
<i>I'll get it.</i>

1215
01:15:49,629 --> 01:15:51,830
No, honey.
No, I-I'll get it.

1216
01:16:02,576 --> 01:16:04,576
Yes?
<i>Mr. yeager?</i>

1217
01:16:04,578 --> 01:16:06,378
Dr. yeager.
I'm sorry.

1218
01:16:06,380 --> 01:16:08,646
Jim Sanders, channel 5 news.
Can we come in?

1219
01:16:08,648 --> 01:16:11,282
W-what can I do for you? It's
kind of windy out there.

1220
01:16:11,284 --> 01:16:14,386
Do you mind if we come in for just a minute?
Yeah, all right.

1221
01:16:14,388 --> 01:16:17,255
<i>Thank you. Hey, you're
from TV, channel 12!</i>

1222
01:16:17,257 --> 01:16:19,657
<i>You're close. Channel 5.</i>
Is that your girl?

1223
01:16:19,659 --> 01:16:22,360
Yeah. What can I do for you? We're
in the middle of breakfast.

1224
01:16:22,362 --> 01:16:24,929
Well, listen. I don't wanna interrupt.
You go right ahead.

1225
01:16:24,931 --> 01:16:27,866
It's just, we're following up on that
story in the paper this morning.

1226
01:16:27,868 --> 01:16:30,568
You know, the one about the-the
"bizarre Phoenix family."

1227
01:16:30,570 --> 01:16:33,571
It looks like we got a national news
story right in our backyard here,

1228
01:16:33,573 --> 01:16:37,242
and, well, I-i wondered if we could
film you guys having breakfast maybe.

1229
01:16:37,244 --> 01:16:39,911
Would that be okay? Well,
they're already doing it.

1230
01:16:39,913 --> 01:16:42,447
What's that thing?

1231
01:16:42,449 --> 01:16:45,050
It's a camera. Yeah? Look at that.

1232
01:16:45,052 --> 01:16:48,219
I wonder how we can work that into the story.
Excuse me one second.

1233
01:16:48,221 --> 01:16:50,321
I wanna make a quick call.
W-would you just excuse me?

1234
01:16:50,323 --> 01:16:52,757
Yeah, sure. Hey, listen. One thing.

1235
01:16:52,759 --> 01:16:56,127
In the paper, it-it kind of implies there's
a sort of brainwashing going on here.

1236
01:16:56,129 --> 01:16:58,296
- Would you comment on that?
- Excuse me just one second.

1237
01:16:58,298 --> 01:17:00,298
Can I take that to mean yes?

1238
01:17:07,908 --> 01:17:09,974
Hello? Albert? Warren.

1239
01:17:09,976 --> 01:17:12,243
Hi. Could you come over here right away?

1240
01:17:12,245 --> 01:17:15,580
Let me eat first, babe. No,
please don't eat first.

1241
01:17:15,582 --> 01:17:18,883
There's a whole news crew here
from channel 12. <i>Channel 5.</i>

1242
01:17:18,885 --> 01:17:21,386
- What?
- Channel 5.

1243
01:17:21,388 --> 01:17:24,155
Albert?
Albert?

1244
01:17:24,157 --> 01:17:26,391
<i>No, no.
Come on.</i>

1245
01:17:26,393 --> 01:17:28,460
The fella you wanna see
will be right over.

1246
01:17:28,462 --> 01:17:30,995
Yeah. This is, Ted cleary,

1247
01:17:30,997 --> 01:17:32,864
no. Albert Brooks.
<i>Right.</i>

1248
01:17:32,866 --> 01:17:35,500
<i>- He's what?
- How do you mean?</i>

1249
01:17:35,502 --> 01:17:38,403
<i>I'm tryin' to get all the</i> positions straight.
There were <i>so many names in that article.</i>

1250
01:17:38,405 --> 01:17:41,139
I-I can't tell who
was who, frankly.

1251
01:17:41,141 --> 01:17:43,208
May I help you? Yeah. You're al, right?

1252
01:17:43,210 --> 01:17:45,944
I'm Albert, yes. Hey, great.
Channel 5 news, al.

1253
01:17:45,946 --> 01:17:49,614
Listen, we're doin' some follow-up on
that story in the paper this morning.

1254
01:17:49,616 --> 01:17:51,616
Dr. yeager was
tellin' me...

1255
01:17:51,618 --> 01:17:54,085
That you're filming him and
his family having breakfast.

1256
01:17:54,087 --> 01:17:56,321
I thought maybe when you're done,

1257
01:17:56,323 --> 01:17:59,557
if you could get them to put on another quick
little breakfast thing for us to film,

1258
01:17:59,559 --> 01:18:02,026
it'd really help us out.
I beg your pardon?

1259
01:18:02,028 --> 01:18:04,195
I don't say this on every
story I go out on,

1260
01:18:04,197 --> 01:18:05,964
but this thing feels big,
it really feels good,

1261
01:18:05,966 --> 01:18:08,133
and everybody in town's gonna be on it.

1262
01:18:08,135 --> 01:18:11,102
But since we're the first ones here, I
thought we could get something special.

1263
01:18:11,104 --> 01:18:13,238
Feels big, feels good? Yeah. Yeah.

1264
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:15,573
Get out of here! You're trespassing!
Hey, Leo!

1265
01:18:15,575 --> 01:18:17,976
Get film on this guy! Get nothing on this!
You're trespassing!

1266
01:18:17,978 --> 01:18:20,445
You're trespassing! This is a movie set!
Wait a minute!

1267
01:18:20,447 --> 01:18:22,847
This is a news story! No, it's a movie!
This is copyrighted!

1268
01:18:22,849 --> 01:18:25,116
Get out of here! On your
copyright, somebody's lying!

1269
01:18:25,118 --> 01:18:27,185
Hum a few bars and figure it out!

1270
01:18:27,187 --> 01:18:29,387
Just move! All right! I
want film on this guy.

1271
01:18:29,389 --> 01:18:31,823
No, you don't!
Get out of here!

1272
01:18:31,825 --> 01:18:34,926
I want to tell you something. This thing
started out to be some kind of a puff piece.

1273
01:18:34,928 --> 01:18:36,995
Now you got me a little bit pissed off.

1274
01:18:36,997 --> 01:18:39,764
I'm gonna get outta here, and I'm gonna
come back here with a court order!

1275
01:18:39,766 --> 01:18:41,966
Court order? That's right, a court order!

1276
01:18:41,968 --> 01:18:44,502
I'll get the biggest lawyer in this
country down to this jerkwater burg!

1277
01:18:44,504 --> 01:18:47,038
You'll see a jury of your peers turn against
you so fast, you won't know what hit you!

1278
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:50,375
Yeah? Mr. cleary, you're gonna regret this.
It's Mr. Brooks!

1279
01:18:50,377 --> 01:18:53,578
And don't threaten me! I work
much better out of pressure!

1280
01:18:53,580 --> 01:18:55,446
Get out!

1281
01:19:00,654 --> 01:19:03,855
It's fine. Go back.
Have a good breakfast.

1282
01:19:03,857 --> 01:19:07,392
I'll be across the street.
I'll take a shower.

1283
01:19:07,394 --> 01:19:09,594
The shower didn't help.

1284
01:19:11,464 --> 01:19:13,464
Mr. yeager!

1285
01:19:13,466 --> 01:19:16,367
The media stayed away
<i>from the yeagers' house.</i>

1286
01:19:16,369 --> 01:19:19,537
<i>However, off their property</i>
they were fair game.

1287
01:19:19,539 --> 01:19:22,073
<i>It started</i> on Monday afternoon.

1288
01:19:22,075 --> 01:19:26,744
<i>While coming home from lunch,</i> Dr. and Mrs.
Yeager encountered <i>a "live eye" truck.</i>

1289
01:19:26,746 --> 01:19:29,547
I don't wanna talk to you.
It won't take long. Come on.

1290
01:19:29,549 --> 01:19:32,150
People are awful worried about you.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1291
01:19:32,152 --> 01:19:34,152
Please.
Excuse us.

1292
01:19:34,154 --> 01:19:37,922
Come on, talk to us.
Dr. yeager!

1293
01:19:37,924 --> 01:19:40,358
Mrs. yeager!

1294
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:42,360
Tuesday afternoon.

1295
01:19:42,362 --> 01:19:44,996
Wait, Mrs. yeager!
Are they hurting you?

1296
01:19:44,998 --> 01:19:46,864
<i>While returning</i> from a shopping spree,

1297
01:19:46,866 --> 01:19:48,866
<i>Mrs. yeager</i> and the
children <i>were accosted.</i>

1298
01:19:48,868 --> 01:19:51,469
Lisa, Eric. We have a lot
of viewers out there...

1299
01:19:51,471 --> 01:19:55,406
<i>You would think the news</i> would have
something better <i>to do in a city this size.</i>

1300
01:19:55,408 --> 01:19:57,842
I have no comment at this time.
<i>Please, Mrs. yeager.</i>

1301
01:19:57,844 --> 01:20:00,445
<i>Wait just a moment.</i> How about your children?
<i>How are they holding up?</i>

1302
01:20:00,447 --> 01:20:03,481
Everything is just fine. Please.
<i>How old are your children?</i>

1303
01:20:03,483 --> 01:20:05,283
Dr. yeager, can we get
a couple of words with...

1304
01:20:05,285 --> 01:20:07,418
Can you take just a second?
Doctor? Doctor?

1305
01:20:07,420 --> 01:20:10,622
What are they doin' to you? Are they
tryin' to hurt you and your family?

1306
01:20:10,624 --> 01:20:13,191
Look over here, Dr. yeager.
Are they hurting you?

1307
01:20:13,193 --> 01:20:15,193
Can you give us a minute?
Give me a smile.

1308
01:20:15,195 --> 01:20:17,595
Dr. and Mrs. yeager. No comment.
No comment.

1309
01:20:17,597 --> 01:20:20,632
Why did you come to see this particular film?
Please, please.

1310
01:20:20,634 --> 01:20:22,634
Can you tell me this?
No comment on the film?

1311
01:20:22,636 --> 01:20:24,802
No comment. Will you stay
to see the second feature?

1312
01:20:24,804 --> 01:20:26,804
Kids, don't say anything.
Dr. yeager, over here!

1313
01:20:26,806 --> 01:20:28,906
Were you forced to see this movie?
Over here!

1314
01:20:28,908 --> 01:20:31,376
As you know, Albert, some
members of the institute...

1315
01:20:31,378 --> 01:20:36,314
<i>An emergency meeting</i> was called for 6:00 P.M.
<i>on Saturday the 25th.</i>

1316
01:20:36,316 --> 01:20:40,385
<i>It was requested by the head</i> of the
national institute <i>of human behavior,</i>

1317
01:20:40,387 --> 01:20:43,121
<i>Dr. Isaac Steven hayward.</i>

1318
01:20:43,123 --> 01:20:45,590
Entirely a new field,
the psychological...

1319
01:20:45,592 --> 01:20:48,660
<i>And approved</i> by Martin brand,

1320
01:20:48,662 --> 01:20:52,096
<i>who considered this meeting</i> important
enough <i>to call from Catalina,</i>

1321
01:20:52,098 --> 01:20:55,400
<i>interrupting the first vacation</i>
he'd had in over a week.

1322
01:20:55,402 --> 01:20:57,402
Albert, we're known in Europe...

1323
01:20:57,404 --> 01:20:59,404
<i>As I sat across the table</i> from this man,

1324
01:20:59,406 --> 01:21:02,740
<i>I was slowly losing my respect</i>
for higher education.

1325
01:21:02,742 --> 01:21:05,610
<i>Also, he wore</i> far too much Cologne.

1326
01:21:05,612 --> 01:21:10,148
When you have a reputation in as difficult a
field as this, you've got to maintain it.

1327
01:21:10,150 --> 01:21:11,949
And you think
something's going on here...

1328
01:21:11,951 --> 01:21:14,352
That's preventing you from
maintaining your reputation?

1329
01:21:14,354 --> 01:21:16,721
I have no opinion. Pfft!

1330
01:21:16,723 --> 01:21:19,324
But we've done a great many
tests in the last five days...

1331
01:21:19,326 --> 01:21:23,528
Everything from public opinion surveys
to urinalyses of our own staff.

1332
01:21:23,530 --> 01:21:25,530
Fine. What do
the tests tell you?

1333
01:21:25,532 --> 01:21:27,699
They indicate to us
that our efforts here...

1334
01:21:27,701 --> 01:21:29,901
Have come to the end
of their useful life.

1335
01:21:29,903 --> 01:21:33,438
Anything beyond this point would
be severely counterproductive.

1336
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:35,673
I see.

1337
01:21:35,675 --> 01:21:37,709
Now it's becoming clear.

1338
01:21:37,711 --> 01:21:40,111
The institute gets
a little heat, and boom!

1339
01:21:40,113 --> 01:21:42,714
They not only leave the kitchen, they
take the whole kitchen with them!

1340
01:21:42,716 --> 01:21:44,816
Let's consider the family for a moment.

1341
01:21:44,818 --> 01:21:47,318
What'd you do?
Run urine tests on them too?

1342
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:49,821
<i>We did a series on them, yes.</i>

1343
01:21:49,823 --> 01:21:54,559
Thanks, Howie. Hope you didn't
get your little hands wet.

1344
01:21:54,561 --> 01:21:56,994
Come on! Jesus Christ!

1345
01:21:56,996 --> 01:22:00,231
Look. These people are very close to
complete personality disintegration.

1346
01:22:00,233 --> 01:22:02,667
Don't make me laugh.

1347
01:22:02,669 --> 01:22:06,170
I don't remember a time in my life when I haven't
been close to personality disintegration.

1348
01:22:06,172 --> 01:22:08,473
And how the hell would you know what
these people are feeling, anyway?

1349
01:22:08,475 --> 01:22:11,876
From your Mickey mouse tests? Don't
blame the tests for what they tell us.

1350
01:22:11,878 --> 01:22:14,879
I don't blame 'em. They're great.
Why don't we do more,

1351
01:22:14,881 --> 01:22:17,115
I bet you'd like it,
wouldn't you, noland?

1352
01:22:17,117 --> 01:22:19,584
<i>Wanna get that cup again?</i>
I'll get you lots of cups.

1353
01:22:19,586 --> 01:22:22,353
Maybe a hundred cups! I'll tell
you something about you people.

1354
01:22:22,355 --> 01:22:26,557
<i>You're great with cups,</i> but
what you don't have <i>are balls!</i>

1355
01:22:26,559 --> 01:22:30,762
I think if you ask any magician, he'll tell you
that cups without balls doesn't mean Jack shit!

1356
01:22:30,764 --> 01:22:33,765
Albert, what the hell
<i>are you talking about?</i>

1357
01:22:33,767 --> 01:22:36,667
Look, let's not argue.
Say the family's fine.

1358
01:22:36,669 --> 01:22:39,937
Say the family's perfect. Let's
talk about you for a minute.

1359
01:22:39,939 --> 01:22:41,773
<i>Look what you've done.</i>

1360
01:22:41,775 --> 01:22:44,442
<i>You failed, that's what you
did. You schmuck, you failed.</i>

1361
01:22:44,444 --> 01:22:49,046
<i>You started out with this</i> artsy-craftsy
reality crap, <i>and what did you end up with?</i>

1362
01:22:49,048 --> 01:22:53,151
The news! The goddamn news!
People get that for free.

1363
01:22:53,153 --> 01:22:55,586
<i>You think somebody's</i>
gonna hire a baby-sitter,

1364
01:22:55,588 --> 01:22:58,189
<i>take a taxicab,</i> go all the
way <i>the hell downtown,</i>

1365
01:22:58,191 --> 01:23:00,491
go up to the box office,
shell out four bucks...

1366
01:23:00,493 --> 01:23:03,094
And say, "here! Here!
Here's my four dollars!"

1367
01:23:03,096 --> 01:23:05,096
<i>What time does</i> the news go on"?

1368
01:23:05,098 --> 01:23:07,098
"Here. Here's
my four dollars."

1369
01:23:07,100 --> 01:23:09,066
Is money your entire life, Martin?

1370
01:23:09,068 --> 01:23:13,004
Money! Money! Let's talk about
human beings for a minute!

1371
01:23:13,006 --> 01:23:15,206
Across the street are four people.

1372
01:23:15,208 --> 01:23:18,276
These people had a dream.
They took on a project.

1373
01:23:18,278 --> 01:23:20,077
It was new, it was exciting,

1374
01:23:20,079 --> 01:23:23,047
and it was supposed to go
a whole year, not two months!

1375
01:23:23,049 --> 01:23:26,717
Now, I'm in show business. I'm used
to my commitments being dumped on.

1376
01:23:26,719 --> 01:23:30,254
But these people are ordinary
people with ordinary feelings.

1377
01:23:30,256 --> 01:23:32,390
Do you wanna go across
the street and tell them?

1378
01:23:32,392 --> 01:23:34,325
No! You won't even
come down here!

1379
01:23:34,327 --> 01:23:37,428
Do you wanna take that responsibility?
No! Just a minute.

1380
01:23:37,430 --> 01:23:40,031
I think they know more than
you give them credit for.

1381
01:23:40,033 --> 01:23:44,068
- Look who's talking.
- The pee hoarder.

1382
01:23:45,038 --> 01:23:46,838
Someone should answer the door.

1383
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:49,841
Why? Why not take
a urinalysis of it?

1384
01:23:49,843 --> 01:23:52,710
Then we'll know who it is without
going there. Isn't that a great idea?

1385
01:23:52,712 --> 01:23:55,713
<i>Come on, noland!</i>
More data! More data!

1386
01:23:55,715 --> 01:23:58,850
We need more data. Come on, Dr.
Cup! More data!

1387
01:23:58,852 --> 01:24:01,919
<i>More data,</i> get some data for me!
<i>More data!</i>

1388
01:24:01,921 --> 01:24:05,723
More data! More data!
We need more, more.

1389
01:24:05,725 --> 01:24:08,259
Hi. What a breath
of fresh air.

1390
01:24:08,261 --> 01:24:10,328
Please, come in.

1391
01:24:11,598 --> 01:24:16,067
Here are your tests, your living tests.

1392
01:24:16,069 --> 01:24:19,604
Dr. and Mrs. yeager, I'm in
the communications business,

1393
01:24:19,606 --> 01:24:21,606
<i>and it's my job</i>
to get through to these people,

1394
01:24:21,608 --> 01:24:23,908
<i>but I don't think</i>
I'm doing very good at it.

1395
01:24:23,910 --> 01:24:27,411
I don't think they understand the
meaning of the word "commitment,"

1396
01:24:27,413 --> 01:24:29,413
the word
"dedication."

1397
01:24:29,415 --> 01:24:31,883
Maybe you can explain it to them.

1398
01:24:36,089 --> 01:24:39,156
- We wanna stop.
- What?

1399
01:24:39,158 --> 01:24:41,259
This is over.
<i>No.</i>

1400
01:24:41,261 --> 01:24:44,028
Look, I don't wanna get into any
more of your intellectual arguments.

1401
01:24:44,030 --> 01:24:47,064
This is ruining our lives. This
is not what we bargained for.

1402
01:24:47,066 --> 01:24:49,467
There was no bargaining.
You applied, we accepted.

1403
01:24:49,469 --> 01:24:52,904
Albert, the children are afraid to go
to school. That's normal, trust me.

1404
01:24:52,906 --> 01:24:55,206
Look, I don't care
what you think is normal.

1405
01:24:55,208 --> 01:24:58,342
We no longer wanna be involved in this
project. That's final. That's it.

1406
01:24:58,344 --> 01:25:01,746
This was the whole family's decision.
I'll bet it was.

1407
01:25:01,748 --> 01:25:05,016
I'm sure little Eric got a full
vote, we're not gonna discuss this.

1408
01:25:05,018 --> 01:25:08,219
Okay, no discussion. Just a
few facts and loose ends,

1409
01:25:08,221 --> 01:25:12,590
$25,000. That's more than half your money
was due on the completion of this picture.

1410
01:25:12,592 --> 01:25:16,427
I don't think this is the end, and I think
you're gonna have to go without the boat...

1411
01:25:16,429 --> 01:25:20,097
And the trailer you've been talking about
for a couple of months, and Lisa's braces.

1412
01:25:20,099 --> 01:25:22,500
I know something about teeth.
She may look all right now.

1413
01:25:22,502 --> 01:25:24,502
In three years she'll
be an elephant girl.

1414
01:25:24,504 --> 01:25:26,337
These come right down to her waist.

1415
01:25:26,339 --> 01:25:29,140
And also, if something, god
forbid, really bad happens,

1416
01:25:29,142 --> 01:25:31,909
you have no insurance, you're
not in the screen actors guild,

1417
01:25:31,911 --> 01:25:34,612
you have no coverage, you'll
get no benefits. <i>Stop it!</i>

1418
01:25:34,614 --> 01:25:38,015
With what they've been through, we could
just pay them and forget about it.

1419
01:25:38,017 --> 01:25:41,886
Okay, we'll forget about it.
Go ahead, take the money.

1420
01:25:41,888 --> 01:25:44,322
Go ahead. I'm gonna get the family
that I wanted to choose anyway.

1421
01:25:44,324 --> 01:25:47,058
- What was their name, the one I wanted?
- The feltons.

1422
01:25:47,060 --> 01:25:49,927
The feltons, Wisconsin! That's
the heart of this country.

1423
01:25:49,929 --> 01:25:53,931
Here's what I say. We all take a week off.
I'll get a high colonic.

1424
01:25:53,933 --> 01:25:57,101
Then we'll come back with a new
family, a bigger institute...

1425
01:25:57,103 --> 01:25:58,903
And another studio!

1426
01:25:58,905 --> 01:26:01,439
We're not spending another
dime on this picture!

1427
01:26:01,441 --> 01:26:03,240
<i>You're nuts to wanna</i> do this again.

1428
01:26:03,242 --> 01:26:06,711
- Don't call me nuts! You're nuts!
- You're nuts!

1429
01:26:06,713 --> 01:26:08,980
You're nuts! You're nuts! You're nuts!

1430
01:26:08,982 --> 01:26:11,215
You're nuts! You're nuts! You schmuck.

1431
01:26:11,217 --> 01:26:13,351
<i>- You're nuts!
- I'm hangin' up!</i>

1432
01:26:13,353 --> 01:26:15,553
You're nuts!

1433
01:26:15,555 --> 01:26:18,289
No, no, no! Wait! Please, wait!
Wait, wait!

1434
01:26:18,291 --> 01:26:21,459
Let's think about me for just one second.

1435
01:26:21,461 --> 01:26:23,294
0dr. Yeager, animals
don't go to movies.

1436
01:26:23,296 --> 01:26:26,297
You think 6,000 dogs are gonna
come out of radio city going,

1437
01:26:26,299 --> 01:26:28,499
"I didn't like the vet so much"?

1438
01:26:28,501 --> 01:26:33,137
No, no. I have to deal with people
like John Simon and Rex Reed.

1439
01:26:33,139 --> 01:26:35,740
Have you ever met these people?
They're killers.

1440
01:26:35,742 --> 01:26:39,610
What are they gonna see? January
and February in Phoenix?

1441
01:26:39,612 --> 01:26:41,679
You think that's gonna do it for me?

1442
01:26:41,681 --> 01:26:44,148
I got nothin' on you.
I got no birthdays.

1443
01:26:44,150 --> 01:26:47,118
<i>I don't have any holidays.</i>
I got nothing.

1444
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:50,454
Where am I gonna be July 4th?
Sitting alone in L.A.?

1445
01:26:50,456 --> 01:26:53,090
No. I wanna be here
with you, filming you.

1446
01:26:53,092 --> 01:26:55,960
Where am I gonna be Halloween?
Sitting alone? No.

1447
01:26:55,962 --> 01:26:58,663
I wanna follow Lisa around
in her cute little costume.

1448
01:26:58,665 --> 01:27:01,499
What about Thanksgiving?
I wanna see you eat the ham.

1449
01:27:01,501 --> 01:27:03,634
I wanna watch you carve up the ham.

1450
01:27:03,636 --> 01:27:06,237
And Christmas?
Please.

1451
01:27:06,239 --> 01:27:08,739
I wanna be here for Christmas!

1452
01:27:08,741 --> 01:27:11,108
I want that
12-foot tree...

1453
01:27:11,110 --> 01:27:16,280
With the angel hair
and the popcorn balls!

1454
01:27:16,282 --> 01:27:18,382
Albert.
Please!

1455
01:27:18,384 --> 01:27:21,118
Albert, Albert, please. Please!

1456
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:23,387
Please, Albert.
I'm fine.

1457
01:27:25,224 --> 01:27:28,392
Folks, we're going to need your
signatures on some disclaimers,

1458
01:27:28,394 --> 01:27:30,561
and some, statements on film.

1459
01:27:30,563 --> 01:27:32,863
Just a few short seconds.

1460
01:27:41,007 --> 01:27:44,308
Albert?
Albert, here.

1461
01:27:44,310 --> 01:27:47,111
What is it?
Valium.

1462
01:27:47,113 --> 01:27:50,681
Thanks. What am I gonna wash it down with?
Urine, Howard?

1463
01:27:50,683 --> 01:27:53,117
Go on, Albert, take it.
It'll be good for you.

1464
01:27:53,119 --> 01:27:56,387
Good. Thanks for being so considerate.
You were a big help at the table.

1465
01:27:56,389 --> 01:27:58,189
Why don't you get the disclaimers?

1466
01:27:58,191 --> 01:28:01,792
Just go get the disclaimers
from them. Okay.

1467
01:28:05,031 --> 01:28:07,198
My god.

1468
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:09,100
Mr. Brooks?

1469
01:28:10,536 --> 01:28:13,637
How did this happen? Are you okay?

1470
01:28:15,608 --> 01:28:18,576
- I put some coffee on.
- Thank you.

1471
01:28:18,578 --> 01:28:21,946
Folks, if you don't mind,
we'll just have you sign these.

1472
01:28:21,948 --> 01:28:25,649
These are some standard forms
relating to limitations of liability.

1473
01:28:25,651 --> 01:28:29,920
I'm sure you have your clients
sign much the same thing, doctor.

1474
01:28:29,922 --> 01:28:32,323
And while you're doing that,
I'll ask you some questions...

1475
01:28:32,325 --> 01:28:34,458
And get your answers on film.

1476
01:28:34,460 --> 01:28:39,463
This would normally be done at the
end of the project... which this is.

1477
01:28:39,465 --> 01:28:42,967
What a sad day.
I'm a big jerk.

1478
01:28:42,969 --> 01:28:44,969
I ruined their life.

1479
01:28:44,971 --> 01:28:48,205
How did I do it?
I didn't mean to do it.

1480
01:28:48,207 --> 01:28:50,841
<i>I'm a failure.</i>
I'm a failure.

1481
01:28:50,843 --> 01:28:53,043
<i>You're not</i> a failure.

1482
01:28:53,045 --> 01:28:56,046
Yes, I am.

1483
01:28:56,048 --> 01:28:57,882
I'm a failure.

1484
01:28:57,884 --> 01:29:00,851
How did it happen?
I had good intentions.

1485
01:29:00,853 --> 01:29:02,887
<i>Hey, it can't</i> be that bad. Look.

1486
01:29:02,889 --> 01:29:06,524
You heard what he said.
His kids can't go to school.

1487
01:29:06,526 --> 01:29:08,325
They're all screwed up.

1488
01:29:08,327 --> 01:29:11,762
They'll never be the same again.
Why do I even make movies?

1489
01:29:11,764 --> 01:29:14,498
I have no right to make movies. I
shouldn't be allowed to do this.

1490
01:29:14,500 --> 01:29:18,269
"Did any representative of the national
institute of human behavior...

1491

01:29:21,974 --> 01:29:24,642
<i>Or family life?"</i>

1493
01:29:24,644 --> 01:29:26,644
Keeping in mind...

1494
01:29:26,646 --> 01:29:29,647
That Mr. Brooks is not connected
with the institute.

1495
01:29:29,649 --> 01:29:32,650
- No.
- You know what I gotta go do now?

1496
01:29:32,652 --> 01:29:37,354
I gotta go put this on, and go down to a
children's hospital and make kids laugh.

1497
01:29:37,356 --> 01:29:39,557
I can't do it.
<i>Hospital?</i>

1498
01:29:39,559 --> 01:29:42,393
It's a benefit. I committed to
it weeks ago, but I can't do it.

1499
01:29:42,395 --> 01:29:44,995
I can't be the happy clown.
What am I gonna say to 'em?

1500
01:29:44,997 --> 01:29:48,499
"Hello, kids. My movie just got
screwed up, but that's okay.

1501
01:29:48,501 --> 01:29:53,437
Get well, 'cause someday you'll go
out and have some jerk film you."

1502
01:29:53,439 --> 01:29:57,107
Why did I pick reality? Why did I
pick that out of all the subjects?

1503
01:29:57,109 --> 01:30:00,544
I don't know anything about it.
What was I doing?

1504
01:30:00,546 --> 01:30:03,047
I'm a stupid, stupid jerk.

1505
01:30:03,049 --> 01:30:05,149
"Were you coerced in any way...

1506

"To participate in this project?" no.

1507
01:30:07,787 --> 01:30:10,020
Maybe I'm overreacting.
Stop me if I do it.

1508
01:30:10,022 --> 01:30:12,223
I overreact a lot. It's good, it's good?

1509
01:30:12,225 --> 01:30:14,725
<i>Yeah. I shouldn't be hard on myself.
We got good scenes here.</i>

1510
01:30:14,727 --> 01:30:18,095
You're right. Hey, it's a good movie.
We got nice things.

1511
01:30:18,097 --> 01:30:21,098
We got animals, we got kids,
we got sunny days.

1512
01:30:21,100 --> 01:30:24,668
What else do you want?
So it ended eight months early.

1513
01:30:24,670 --> 01:30:27,338
Like an abortion.
It's an abortion.

1514
01:30:27,340 --> 01:30:31,375
This thing's an abortion. I'm involved
in an abortion. God, I'm in big trouble.

no, no.</i>

1520
01:30:46,025 --> 01:30:49,627
I mean, they were gonna give me a year.
They were gonna give me a whole year.

1521
01:30:49,629 --> 01:30:53,063
I was gonna do somethin' nice. I
was gonna end with new year's!

1522
01:30:53,065 --> 01:30:56,267
Up! Up!
The beginning! New!

1523
01:30:56,269 --> 01:31:00,738
Somethin' so audiences can
go home and smile. But this?

"Would this experience prejudice
you against participating in...

Another type of audience or marketing

1526
01:31:09,548 --> 01:31:11,548
I don't think so.

1527
01:31:11,550 --> 01:31:14,018
Well, not a live-in.
Not a live-in, no.

1528
01:31:15,554 --> 01:31:19,757
I never thought I'd say this.
The studio is right.

1529
01:31:19,759 --> 01:31:23,627
The audience loves fake.
They crave fake.

1530
01:31:23,629 --> 01:31:25,863
Reality sucks.

1531
01:31:25,865 --> 01:31:27,798
I can do fake.
I'm capable.

1532
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:30,868
I just won't get a chance. I won't
ever be able to work again.

1533
01:31:30,870 --> 01:31:33,938
Come on, take it easy.
Okay, wait a minute.

1534
01:31:33,940 --> 01:31:36,006
Wait a minute.
It's not too late.

1535
01:31:36,008 --> 01:31:38,542
We can end this movie fake.
We can end it big.

1536
01:31:38,544 --> 01:31:41,145
We can end it up. We can
send the people home happy.

1537
01:31:41,147 --> 01:31:43,380
Mr. Brooks! What? What?

1538
01:31:43,382 --> 01:31:45,983
There's no law that says, what,
"start real, can't end fake"?

1539
01:31:45,985 --> 01:31:50,387
What are they gonna do? Put me in movie jail?
It's a fake jail. Come on.

1540
01:31:50,389 --> 01:31:52,556
What's the biggest movie
ever made? Come on.

1541
01:31:52,558 --> 01:31:54,959
We'll take, we'll borrow.
That's the meaning of art.

1542
01:31:54,961 --> 01:31:57,728
You borrow a little, a little, a little,
put it together... it's something new.

1543
01:31:57,730 --> 01:32:00,631
What's the biggest movie? <i>Star wars.
How did it end?</i> sir?

1544
01:32:00,633 --> 01:32:03,834
- You okay?
- Zoom! They blew up a planet!

1545
01:32:03,836 --> 01:32:07,271
They blew up a planet! Fantastic!
We can do that! How did they do it?

1546
01:32:07,273 --> 01:32:09,873
What's the trick?
How did they do it?

1547
01:32:09,875 --> 01:32:11,875
Come on!
Help me!

1548
01:32:11,877 --> 01:32:14,044
"Has your association
with the institute...

1549

Benefitted your life
in any way?"

1550
01:32:16,782 --> 01:32:19,216
I'd like to think about that a little.

1551
01:32:19,218 --> 01:32:21,218
What's the second biggest film?

1552
01:32:21,220 --> 01:32:24,755
<i>Jaws. All right,</i> jaws.
This is a good idea.

1553
01:32:24,757 --> 01:32:27,291
This is a good idea!
I can save this picture!

1554
01:32:27,293 --> 01:32:30,060
<i>Jaws.
My god, Pete.</i>

1555
01:32:30,062 --> 01:32:33,998
There is a gigantic fish down at the zoo. I
remember when we were down there filming.

1556
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:37,468
The zookeeper's a fan of mine 'cause I gave
him an autograph. He'll let us in tonight.

1557
01:32:37,470 --> 01:32:39,937
I can get the family down there
in the middle of the night.

1558
01:32:39,939 --> 01:32:43,040
We'll have this confrontation...
Gigantic fish, family.

1559
01:32:43,042 --> 01:32:45,242
They'll meet.
I'll put music behind it.

1560
01:32:48,314 --> 01:32:50,814
I'm mentally ill.
I'm goin' nuts.

1561
01:32:50,816 --> 01:32:54,151
<i>God.</i> what am I <i>gonna do?</i>

1562
01:32:55,755 --> 01:32:58,088
What's the third biggest film?
<i>Gone with the wind.</i>

1563
01:32:58,090 --> 01:33:00,157
Timeless, timeless film. Beautiful film.

1564
01:33:02,194 --> 01:33:04,395
How did it end?
I didn't see it.

1565
01:33:04,397 --> 01:33:07,498
You didn't see it? You didn't
see <i>gone with the wind?</i>

1566
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:11,135
Only the biggest film ever made.
You didn't see it?

1567
01:33:11,137 --> 01:33:14,405
My god, it was spectacular, Pete.
You oughta go see it.

1568
01:33:14,407 --> 01:33:17,674
You're in this business. They only
burn down the city of Atlanta.

1569
01:33:17,676 --> 01:33:20,644
A gigantic fire.
I mean...

1570
01:33:25,184 --> 01:33:27,718
I mean...

1571
01:33:29,855 --> 01:33:32,723
Mr. Brooks?

1572
01:33:34,760 --> 01:33:37,694
Mr. Brooks?

1573
01:33:43,803 --> 01:33:47,471
"Had you heard of the institute
before the project began?"

1574
01:33:47,473 --> 01:33:49,273
No.

1575
01:33:49,275 --> 01:33:52,810
"Which of the tests
did you enjoy the most?"

1576
01:33:56,348 --> 01:33:58,615
I enjoyed working with the computers.

1577
01:33:58,617 --> 01:34:03,320
I wouldn't say that I
<i>enjoyed any of the testing.</i>

1578
01:34:07,726 --> 01:34:10,027
Is it the coffee burning?

1579
01:34:10,029 --> 01:34:12,029
No, that smells a little like toast.

1580
01:34:12,031 --> 01:34:14,565
You didn't put anything...

1581
01:34:14,567 --> 01:34:17,034
Excuse me for a second, please.

1582
01:34:20,739 --> 01:34:23,006
Albert, what...
Trust me!

1583
01:34:23,008 --> 01:34:26,009

01:34:27,847 --> 01:34:31,482
What are you doing? Isn't it beautiful?
Look at that!

1586
01:34:31,484 --> 01:34:34,618
<i>The kids! Yeah, the kids! Save the kids!</i>

1587
01:34:34,620 --> 01:34:37,921
What a beautiful family!
This family is so beautiful!

1588
01:34:37,923 --> 01:34:39,957
Albert, stop! Are you crazy? Crazy?

1589
01:34:39,959 --> 01:34:43,894
Get out! Go ahead, get outta here!
Was David o. Selznick crazy?

1590
01:34:43,896 --> 01:34:46,196
Albert!

Pete!

My god!
Come here!

1593
01:34:52,538 --> 01:34:54,838
Are you okay?
Look!

1594
01:34:54,840 --> 01:34:56,640
Can you see it?
Can you see it?

1595
01:34:56,642 --> 01:34:59,143
Isn't it beautiful?
Focus for me, baby!

1596
01:34:59,145 --> 01:35:03,113
<i>I can't see!</i> It's beautiful!
<i>It's so beautiful!</i>

- Darling, run!

1599
01:35:08,154 --> 01:35:10,220
Albert, for god's sake, get out!

1600

Save them! Save them!
Look at 'em go!

1601
01:35:12,892 --> 01:35:17,394
This is so exciting! This is a million
times better than a big fish!

1602
01:35:17,396 --> 01:35:21,064
This is so beautiful!
We did it, Pete!

1603
01:35:21,066 --> 01:35:23,634
We did it! We did it! I can't see!

1604
01:35:23,636 --> 01:35:26,003
<i>I can't</i> see! <i>We did it!</i>

1605
01:35:26,005 --> 01:35:28,472
Look at it, babe!

1606
01:35:28,474 --> 01:35:33,010
It's the most spectacular ending
anybody could've ever had!

1607
01:35:33,012 --> 01:35:36,847
Humor! Pathos!
Tragedy!

1608
01:35:36,849 --> 01:35:39,850
And it's real!
It's real!

1609
01:35:39,852 --> 01:35:43,554
Their house is really burning!
