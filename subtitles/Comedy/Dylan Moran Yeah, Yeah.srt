1
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:09,390
We're back, Mother.

2
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:11,120
She's not home.

3
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,720
- What are you doing?
- Well...

4
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:17,499
Where's Mother?

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,920
She's at Uncle Kyung Ho's.

6
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:20,750
Why?

7
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,750
Aunt Myung Ran was crying.
She didn't say why.

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,120
- We bought some fruits.
- Okay.

9
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,490
Did Uncle Kyung Ho cheat on her?

10
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:31,330
Why would a grown-up woman cry?

11
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:33,810
Don't get in trouble by
saying something silly again.

12
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:35,520
Go change and wash yourself.

13
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:43,720
Who is this?

14
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,690
It's me, Myung Ran.

15
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,010
You didn't have to come here.

16
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:59,820
It sounded like something serious.

17
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:02,690
I just had a breakdown.

18
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,160
Come in.

19
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:12,090
Have a seat.

20
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:22,319
Myung Ran.

21
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,420
You know how I've been living.

22
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,859
What is this all about?

23
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,290
So Hee is getting married.

24
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:36,350
If Jae Ho treated you like dirt,

25
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:41,020
how long do you think you could stand it?

26
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,550
Myung Ran, well...

27
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,839
It's just the way Kyung Ho speaks.

28
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,420
- He doesn't treat you that way.
- All right.

29
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,260
I know that no one in this family...

30
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,050
is on my side.

31
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,990
No one has ever looked at
it from my perspective.

32
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,590
Not even Mother has.

33
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,709
Even when there are other people,

34
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:06,350
he yells at me and insults me.

35
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,590
Yet no one has ever defended me.

36
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:14,090
I've been hurt so many times.

37
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,250
You had to work your butt off,

38
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,739
but Father and Mother
recognise your efforts...

39
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,490
and your husband respects you.

40
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,150
I was always jealous of you.

41
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,659
What's the point of saying all this?

42
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,060
It's all in the past now.

43
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,220
- Myung Ran.
- I told him to end it.

44
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:38,189
I can't keep living this way
for the rest of my life.

45
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:41,609
You've come so far. Just
consider it as a bad habit.

46
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:44,350
See? I'm dying here,

47
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:48,090
and everyone else cares just that much.

48
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,079
I see.

49
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,250
I gave up everything...

50
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:56,290
and pretended I was an idiot,

51
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,890
but I don't want any of this any longer.

52
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,420
If I continue doing this,

53
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,390
my life will be so pathetic.

54
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,950
What did Kyung Ho say?

55
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,090
He didn't think I meant it.

56
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:16,620
He never takes me seriously.

57
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,020
So Hee is getting married.

58
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,920
We'll get to the paperwork
after her wedding.

59
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:25,220
So Hee doesn't take it seriously, either.

60
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:31,050
Do you see?

61
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,950
No one takes me seriously.

62
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,219
His father gave his apartment to him...

63
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,169
before he passed away.

64
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:46,339
I see.

65
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,659
He even has a small commercial building.

66
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,899
The rent isn't apparently very high,

67
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,609
but it's still better than
working as a salary-man.

68
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:53,990
Of course.

69
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,369
If So Hee continues working,
they'll be very well-off.

70
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:00,619
No one can predict the future,

71
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,459
but he seemed nice.

72
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,520
I should trust him. What can I do?

73
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,989
Of course. It's up to So Hee now.

74
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:10,350
Leave it up to her.

75
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:15,190
They've known each other for a long time.
That's a good thing.

76
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,050
Don't you know?

77
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,399
Even if you've been apart for decades,

78
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,379
you can always catch up with
your old friends very fast.

79
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,390
That's right.

80
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,429
They insisted that they were just friends,

81
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,569
but I knew there was something going on.

82
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:33,220
They went from friends to lovers.

83
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:37,009
He should meet Father and Mother, too.

84
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,359
Of course.

85
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,679
Have you told them?

86
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,650
I'm going to tell them on my way home.

87
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,050
All right.

88
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:47,050
We have so many things to celebrate.

89
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,050
That's right.

90
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,190
Should I try making pork and kimchi rice?

91
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,550
You should always remember
Hye Kyung's efforts.

92
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:05,020
She prepared three meals
a day all year around.

93
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:07,420
After breakfast,

94
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,159
you think about what to make for
lunch while washing the dishes.

95
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,899
After lunch,

96
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,519
you think about what to make for dinner.

97
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,490
We spend all our lives eating.

98
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,519
We spend our lives sleeping, too.

99
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,450
For the rest of the time, we
worry about our children.

100
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,290
Life is nothing special after all.

101
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,720
We spend all our lives fretting,
thinking life is something special.

102
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:34,109
Still, Min Ho is having a baby at his age.

103
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:36,120
Your life is a success.

104
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:39,719
You're right. I do hope I'll get to...

105
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,090
see the baby.

106
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,889
It'll be all right. Soo Mi is strong.

107
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:47,590
You're right. I hope so.

108
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,290
What are you doing?

109
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:20,720
They're fresh. Dad should eat
them raw while they're fresh.

110
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,350
They're for you.

111
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,350
You're making me octopus soup.

112
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:28,590
How's Aunt Myung Ran?

113
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:31,950
I'm not sure. She seemed determined.

114
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:33,790
What happened?

115
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,750
I didn't even ask because
it was so obvious.

116
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,850
They'll get the paperwork
done after So Hee's wedding.

117
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:41,899
Did Uncle Kyung Ho agree?

118
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,459
So Hee and Kyung Ho don't
take it seriously...

119
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,950
which upsets Myung Ran even more.

120
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,750
She's put up with him all her life.
There's not even much time left.

121
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:55,799
It's a silver divorce. I understand her.

122
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,339
Uncle Kyung Ho is the
worst kind of husband.

123
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:01,720
She should have set things
straight in the beginning.

124
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,320
My goodness.

125
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:07,689
If they're getting married this
September, you must be busy.

126
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:10,650
We are. We should start by
deciding whom to invite.

127
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,009
We're not going to do like you did.

128
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:15,490
We're going to invite as
many guests as possible.

129
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,820
Do whatever you want.

130
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,219
Only invite those really close to you.

131
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,889
Don't invite anyone who'd
think, "Why is he inviting me?"

132
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:27,269
I'm going to invite everyone
whose wedding I attended.

133
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:29,090
That's reasonable.

134
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:32,949
Oh my. What brings you all here?

135
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:35,619
You don't have to stand up.

136
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,820
How have you been?

137
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,989
How have you been?

138
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,290
It's nice to see you.

139
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,019
I heard you stop by at the
kids' store from time to time.

140
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,139
I do.

141
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:50,829
Se Joon works too hard.

142
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:53,590
I feel bad for him.

143
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:56,320
It seems like...

144
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:59,479
they have a lot of customers, though.
I'm so proud.

145
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,490
That's right.

146
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,149
Sit down. Go back to your conversation.

147
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,420
- Okay.
- Well, then.

148
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,620
Thank you for coming here
every once in a while.

149
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:13,759
Well...

150
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,820
All right.

151
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:18,120
When the weather gets cooler,

152
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:21,550
I'll treat you to a dinner
at Gwangcheon Restaurant.

153
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:22,950
Okay.

154
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,750
All right.

155
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,690
It's done. Let's sit down.

156
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,750
Well...

157
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:44,460
- It's about Father's apartment.
- Okay.

158
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,290
He wants Aunt to have it later.

159
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,190
- Is that true?
- The whole apartment?

160
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,460
Of course. Would she get only a half?

161
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,150
I mean...

162
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:59,869
Isn't that too much?

163
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,690
Mother worked so hard.

164
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:06,490
Father contributed a little as well,
but Mother should take most credit.

165
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,190
Still...

166
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,199
Aunt helped Mother out a lot.

167
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,050
Hasn't she been rewarded enough?

168
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,379
She lost all of it,

169
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:18,469
but Father and Mother rewarded
her more than enough.

170
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,420
Father decided to do so.

171
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:24,420
We have no say in this matter.

172
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:28,959
Kyung Ho.

173
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,650
I do understand, but I'm
not happy about it.

174
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:35,379
Father never gave me any money for free.

175
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:38,269
It's just that Mother is
giving her apartment to Aunt.

176
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,590
Forget it. I won't pay Father back.

177
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:46,999
What did I tell you? I
knew this was Aunt's plan.

178
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,939
That's not true.

179
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,889
How do you know for certain?

180
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,920
Or was it your plan?

181
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,120
Aunt is Mother's only sister.

182
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:00,519
This way, Father and Mother
will be less worried about her.

183
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,650
In any case, this is just too much.

184
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,220
Call me greedy.

185
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,589
What's so funny? Have
you been aware of this?

186
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:14,929
I just found out. How
would I have been aware?

187
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:16,350
Then why did you laugh?

188
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,090
Your bingsu is melting. Eat it.

189
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,250
What do you need?

190
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,960
You should take a look at this.

191
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:39,410
Are you looking for an apartment?

192
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,389
You can move in here from next March.

193
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:44,220
Yu Ri's mother wants to
rent this place out to us.

194
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,650
She wanted to get a 130m² one,

195
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:52,090
but I told her 100m² is enough.

196
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:57,019
- I see.
- I'm considering it for Yu Ri.

197
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,420
Do whatever you want.

198
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,850
We can't do it for you anyway. We're
not in the position to butt in.

199
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:06,490
You're making him uncomfortable.
Why do you talk like that?

200
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,789
You don't seem happy.

201
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,020
Do you expect me to say,

202
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:14,429
"That's great. Live off
your mother-in-law"?

203
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:17,319
You don't have to be so stubborn
unless you feel inferior.

204
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,339
Once you move out, Yu Ri's mother
will give you more help than we do.

205
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,850
Do that. It's okay.

206
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:23,889
Thank you.

207
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:26,079
This is the first time
you've ever thanked me.

208
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,020
- I'll send Yu Ri down.
- It's okay. There isn't much to do.

209
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,020
Has she given up making them live with her?

210
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:37,450
There won't be any difference.

211
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:43,159
I lost both sons.

212
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,420
Men care more about their
in-laws once they get married.

213
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:48,590
Fine. I don't care.

214
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:51,829
If I was going to lose them anyway,

215
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:55,420
why did I fight so hard
against the in-laws?

216
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,150
Mother.

217
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,490
We're going on a trip for a few
days before her belly gets bigger.

218
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:07,520
Can't you wait until the
weather cools down?

219
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:10,120
She wants to go to Yongpyeong.
It's cooler there.

220
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:12,490
- With Yu Ri's mother?
- Yes.

221
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:16,019
They have a house there. It's
close to Gangneung as well.

222
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,590
- Go ahead. No one's stopping you.
- Okay.

223
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:22,290
We'll go out and buy some clothes
at Uncle Min Ho's store.

224
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:23,820
Okay.

225
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,920
I'm definitely not a saint.

226
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:34,520
Why was he so stuck up at first if
he was going to change so fast?

227
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,220
I can't stand him.

228
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,150
Why did you lock the door?

229
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:03,750
What are you doing in there?
Are you drinking?

230
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:08,650
- Hey, Myung Ran.
- I'm doing something. Wait there.

231
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:12,790
- What are you doing?
- You can't come in now.

232
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,620
I need to lie down.

233
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,720
Can't you lie down somewhere else?

234
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:33,390
Oh, right.

235
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:36,750
I completely forgot.

236
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,550
Hi, Min Ho.

237
00:14:06,551 --> 00:14:09,219
Where are you? Are you with Mother?

238
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,350
I'm almost home. See you.

239
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:22,390
I stopped by at the bookstore.
I need to study.

240
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:25,969
Why didn't you ask me to come with you?

241
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,520
It's not far away.

242
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,350
You shouldn't drive alone.

243
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,889
Can't you be more careful?

244
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:37,190
I'm sorry. I won't do it again.

245
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,989
I have to stop by at the
store before dinner.

246
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,250
Okay.

247
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,509
Next time, I'll bring the price analysis.

248
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,390
I was going to ask you to.

249
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,019
I already rearranged ramyeon and snacks...

250
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,380
according to the data you sent me.

251
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:56,839
- Here. Drink this.
- I'm okay.

252
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,320
Drink this and help us more.

253
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,319
Do you think this will do the trick?

254
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,020
If we give you more than
this, we'll be punished.

255
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:11,490
We'll do our best to make
your hard work pay off.

256
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:16,809
Oh, right. We only have bananas
under the snack shelves right now.

257
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:19,169
We're going to order fruit salads as well.

258
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:20,390
Washed apples, too.

259
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:25,319
Everything's selling out so fast.
You're amazing.

260
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,790
We're just starting out now.

261
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,390
- Welcome.
- Dad.

262
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:34,490
Father.

263
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:36,589
I came to buy some ice candy.

264
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:37,620
I see.

265
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,390
Please come. It's that way.

266
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,550
Why don't you pick some out for me?

267
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:45,799
Okay. How many do you want?

268
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,440
- About 10 of them will be good.
- Okay.

269
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,259
Se Joon.

270
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,929
So Hee is getting married.

271
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:55,399
- Really?
- Is she marrying someone?

272
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,890
Yes. He already met her parents.

273
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,940
They'll get married in September.

274
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:01,550
She told me she didn't want to get married.

275
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,169
Did she say that?

276
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:06,350
Yes. She said there is
no guy she can trust.

277
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,190
I'm sorry, Father.

278
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,120
It's fine.

279
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:20,150
One is for the beach, and the other
is for when we go to the temple.

280
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:22,299
Just buy one.

281
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,879
I'm sick of wearing the same clothes.

282
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,400
I'll be sweating, so I have to change.

283
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:27,050
You should buy two as well.

284
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:28,849
I'm fine with this.

285
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:31,950
My mum will give us a lecture for
wearing the same clothes twice.

286
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,679
Fine. I'll buy just one.

287
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,379
You should go and try this on.

288
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,660
Let's see what suits you better.

289
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:41,250
I'll just buy this.

290
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,689
Please try it on. You
might feel differently.

291
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:44,690
See?

292
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,420
My gosh.

293
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:58,030
I'll take 2 shirts for each of us.
That's 4 shirts.

294
00:16:58,950 --> 00:16:59,950
Here is my card.

295
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,809
I'll give you the discount
for family members.

296
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:02,820
All right.

297
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,420
Uncle Min Ho.

298
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,399
What brings you here?

299
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,850
We're going on a vacation
next weekend for a few days.

300
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,250
Is that so?

301
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,990
- What's that?
- Yes, Sir.

302
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:18,939
Don't charge it. I'll take care of it.

303
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:21,249
No, Uncle Min Ho. You shouldn't do that.

304
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,939
- It's fine.
- No, it's not.

305
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:24,990
Don't do that.

306
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,239
- Charge it, please.
- Hey. I can buy it for you.

307
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,390
Uncle Min Ho. It's fine.

308
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:38,359
I think you moved to a great place.

309
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,949
This place is bringing you good luck.

310
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,069
What?

311
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:43,739
Are you talking about
having a late grandchild?

312
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:44,929
That, too.

313
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,839
What about Se Hee's accident?

314
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,569
That also happened after they moved.

315
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:50,250
Except that.

316
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:54,790
So Hee is getting married, Mother.

317
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,350
What? Is she seeing someone?

318
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:59,989
Yes. She found one.

319
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:01,390
He just came to see us.

320
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,929
I'll introduce him to you soon.

321
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:06,129
Goodness.

322
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:08,319
This must be a lucky place indeed.

323
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,369
This is another great news.

324
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:12,890
So do you and Myung Ran like him?

325
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:16,089
Well, we will have to see,

326
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:17,799
but he looks fine.

327
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,820
He has a decent job, and he is
from a middle-income family.

328
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:24,320
One flaw is that his mother is
divorced and getting remarried,

329
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:27,529
but it's not even a flaw these days.

330
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:30,520
Myung Ran says she's glad his mother
won't give So Hee a hard time.

331
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:33,409
Is his mother going to get married again?

332
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:35,699
Yes. She's getting married
to someone in the States.

333
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,590
She would come back once or twice a year.

334
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:42,279
So Hee picked a great guy. Don't you think?

335
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,789
Gosh.

336
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,590
What's so bad about living
with one's in-laws?

337
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,820
You must feel so relieved.

338
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,329
It's a bit disappointing,

339
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:55,790
but I do feel relieved.

340
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,829
Father. You were home.

341
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:01,250
Yes. Is it night-time already?

342
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:04,259
The sun hasn't set yet.

343
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:07,290
So Hee is getting married, Jong Chul.

344
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,039
What did you say?

345
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,360
He's not wearing his hearing aid.

346
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:14,250
So Hee is getting married!

347
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,389
Who is doing what?

348
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:18,709
How can his hearing be this bad?

349
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:20,329
Just go to the bathroom.

350
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:22,850
- Go and get his hearing aid.
- Okay.

351
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,790
No.

352
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,550
Nothing happened.

353
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:31,389
Well... Hye Kyung.

354
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:34,050
I told them about Aunt and the apartment.

355
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,420
You finally told them.

356
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,890
Are they okay with it?

357
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,399
Kyung Ho complained a little
saying it's too much,

358
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,769
but they all agreed.

359
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:45,820
Good.

360
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,390
What else?

361
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,790
There was nothing else.

362
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,550
Should there be more?

363
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:55,120
So Hee is getting married.

364
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:56,790
I know that.

365
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,890
So Hee came by when we were out.

366
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,620
I see.

367
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,600
Myung Ran wants to divorce Kyung Ho.

368
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:06,050
What?

369
00:20:06,051 --> 00:20:08,589
She says she can't stand him.
She wants a divorce.

370
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:10,590
She was crying on the phone,
so I went to see her.

371
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,879
She said she told Kyung Ho about it.
Didn't he say anything?

372
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,190
No.

373
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,449
He seemed happy that So
Hee is getting married.

374
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:22,819
As far as I know, she has never
mentioned divorce until now.

375
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,999
How can he be so indifferent?

376
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,850
He's totally ignoring her words.

377
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,929
This is why Myung Ran wants to divorce him.

378
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:31,299
Why does she want a divorce?

379
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:34,499
Why do you think? He must've yelled
at her and looked down on her...

380
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,239
in front of So Hee's boyfriend.

381
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,269
Even so, Kyung Ho does that all the time.

382
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,819
I thought she is used to it now.

383
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,750
How can you get used to
something like that?

384
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:46,489
Why are you angry at me?
I didn't do anything.

385
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,289
I think she made up her mind.

386
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:49,520
She looked different.

387
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,679
She's mad at all of us. She thinks
we just stood by and watched.

388
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,720
You should know that.

389
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:01,050
Myung Ran must be really upset.

390
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,520
I don't think they'll get divorced.

391
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:07,050
Getting divorced isn't easy.

392
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,490
She will forgive him soon.

393
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,890
- Hello?
- Myung Ran.

394
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,550
Hye Kyung told me...

395
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:56,020
you're angry with Kyung Ho.

396
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,590
I wish I was angry.

397
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,650
I'm not angry, Jae Ho.

398
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:03,950
You know that Kyung Ho
is just like a child.

399
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:08,759
Yelling is just his bad habit.

400
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,990
You've been patient with it until now.

401
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,850
Kyung Ho seemed fine.

402
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:16,609
He was excited about...

403
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:19,420
So Hee's marriage. He looked very happy.

404
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,520
Jae Ho.

405
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:22,990
Yes.

406
00:22:22,991 --> 00:22:25,390
That's why I can't live with him any more.

407
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:29,650
I told him that I wanted to
divorce him for the first time.

408
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:33,069
How can he look so happy after hearing it?

409
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:35,790
It means he thinks so little of me.

410
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:37,429
That's...

411
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:41,319
He wouldn't have thought
you were being serious.

412
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,320
He must've thought you were just mad.

413
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:45,920
Are you saying he just didn't
care about what I said?

414
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:47,879
That's not what I meant.

415
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,969
Did he just ignore me then?

416
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:50,990
Myung Ran.

417
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:52,750
Myung Ran.

418
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:55,090
I don't want to speak
to his family any more.

419
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,590
I'll hang up.

420
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:03,250
He must've been harsh on her.

421
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:10,720
Min Ho. Where are you?

422
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,120
I'm at my shop.

423
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:14,450
I'm about to go home now.

424
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,350
What?

425
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:20,090
Yes.

426
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,650
I can't believe him.

427
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:27,890
He must've been so mean to her
to make her upset like that.

428
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,520
What happened?

429
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,550
Divorce?

430
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,119
He didn't look like he heard it at all.

431
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,750
That's the problem with Kyung Ho.

432
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:44,220
Even my wife is upset that Kyung
Ho looks down on her that much.

433
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,750
Kyung Ho clearly has a problem.

434
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:51,990
Of course. I doubt that they
will actually get divorced.

435
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:56,050
I don't think so, but Hye Kyung
said Myung Ran looked different.

436
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:58,399
She does seem different.

437
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,820
She hung up on me.

438
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,350
She says she doesn't want to speak to us.

439
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:04,950
Yes.

440
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:06,650
Right.

441
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,920
Okay.

442
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:13,550
Min Ho says...

443
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:15,620
we should wait and see.

444
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:19,259
What else can we do? Did you
call for a family meeting?

445
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,590
No.

446
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:25,020
Lie down.

447
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,659
I'll give you a massage.

448
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,109
Do it gently.

449
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,320
Okay.

450
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:45,750
I think her phone is on silent mode.

451
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:47,650
Okay.

452
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,520
- When is she coming back?
- What?

453
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,490
Whenever she wants.

454
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,890
It feels weird without her.

455
00:24:58,650 --> 00:24:59,650
I know.

456
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:03,220
I feel like I'm missing
one side of the wall.

457
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:06,690
Deep down,

458
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:09,290
she must resent me.

459
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:12,190
I think she does.

460
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:14,390
Ask her yourself later.

461
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:17,190
She will say she doesn't resent you at all.

462
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:21,090
I got to know what kind of person she is.

463
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,859
She may be resenting me,

464
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,120
but not you.

465
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,390
She thinks about you and
me in a different way.

466
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:32,320
She told me to become a decent guy...

467
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:34,120
and a decent adult.

468
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:36,970
I don't know if I can do it.

469
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:40,720
It'll be tough to meet her standards.

470
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:44,050
Let's see.

471
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,350
It's done.

472
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,750
I want to take a picture
of it and send it to her.

473
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:56,550
Sure.

474
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,790
I got a haircut, got it
dyed and got my nails done.

475
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:07,620
I don't even know how long that took.

476
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:10,320
I also checked out some wedding dresses.

477
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:12,150
I'm exhausted.

478
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:15,550
Okay. I'll call you later.

479
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,290
Sure.

480
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:21,220
I can check this one off my list.
Where's Dad?

481
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:22,990
He's not home.

482
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,220
I'm doomed, Mum.

483
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,929
I spoke to Mother earlier and she said...

484
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:30,989
it's been 10 years since they
renovated their apartment.

485
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:32,979
She wants to paint the walls,

486
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:35,420
change the bathroom tiles
and get new toilet and tub.

487
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,039
We're changing the curtains as well.

488
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,090
But she wants me to
change them to my style.

489
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,550
You should do it then.

490
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:45,319
I would ask Se Hee for
help if she was fine.

491
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,820
She has a good taste.

492
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:49,831
But with her in that condition,
I can't even bring it up.

493
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,919
We don't have that much time left
and Joon Woo has to go to work.

494
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,650
I have to do everything.

495
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:59,219
I have to call up people, get estimates...

496
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,820
and put them to work. It's all on me.

497
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:08,529
Did you speak to Dad after I left?

498
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:09,550
I'm not kidding...

499
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,090
when I said I didn't want
to live with your dad.

500
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:17,250
Women in my age...

501
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:20,170
act differently from when they were young.

502
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:23,790
As you age, you don't always have
to take care of the husband.

503
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:28,490
They have a say and go on trips overseas...

504
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:31,050
with their husband and friends.

505
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:37,250
It's okay if I don't have a say
or don't get to travel overseas.

506
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:41,220
Your dad always complains,

507
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:44,810
but it's more difficult for
me who's slow with things.

508
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,790
I try to do as he says, and I
never meet his expectations.

509
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:55,950
At some point, I just gave
up and lived like a fool.

510
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,490
I don't want to do this any more.

511
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:04,690
I was busy making ends meet that
I never took care of my parents.

512
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:06,190
Never mind.

513
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:10,099
When they went bankrupt,

514
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,390
your dad did take care of my parents.

515
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,890
I give him credit for that.

516
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:17,520
Still,

517
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:21,990
he would always call me an old wretch.

518
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,050
"What do you think you're doing, woman?
Be quiet."

519
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:29,410
He doesn't let me say anything...

520
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:33,390
and treats me less than a human.

521
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,390
I didn't know my life
would turn out this way.

522
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:43,450
I brought this upon myself, so
there's no point complaining.

523
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:46,890
It's just pathetic that I have no one...

524
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:49,320
to complain to.

525
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:53,920
I understand what you're saying.
I understand you fully.

526
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:58,120
When I was young, I thought you were
a fool, but you're truly incredible.

527
00:28:58,550 --> 00:28:59,890
That's what I think now.

528
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,990
Fine. Dad deserves to be punished.

529
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:06,609
You should punish him so that
he never does this again.

530
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:09,620
I'll file the divorce after your wedding.

531
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,750
Mum, are you being serious?

532
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,750
Do you mean it?

533
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:27,450
That's right. Corns are in season.

534
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,220
- That's hot!
- Oh, dear.

535
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:33,190
Mother, we are...

536
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:36,790
so busy with our restaurant that
we never eat seasonal fruits.

537
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:41,059
Myung Ran is not so clever.

538
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:44,529
She's capable of only working
at the restaurant. My goodness.

539
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:47,950
Don't say that. She's doing
a lot of work for her age.

540
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:52,320
- I don't want it.
- Why not?

541
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:56,090
- I can't chew it properly.
- Fine.

542
00:29:57,850 --> 00:29:58,850
By the way, Aunt.

543
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:02,150
We're going to eat dinner soon.
Why would you feed us this?

544
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:05,020
Just break off a piece.

545
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:08,520
This is good.

546
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:12,039
- Aunt, can I...
- Gosh, fine.

547
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,920
Didn't you hear Sook Ja
telling me to make enough?

548
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:16,590
I didn't.

549
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:20,090
Then...

550
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,190
What's going to happen to Dad?

551
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:24,750
I feel bad for him.

552
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:29,720
I understand your point of view,

553
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,439
but what would Dad do without you?
I can't imagine it.

554
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,490
What do you mean?

555
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:38,890
He has his parents and
his wonderful brothers.

556
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:41,210
I'll be pathetic without
a family of my own.

557
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,450
And you're worried about your dad?

558
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,450
You two were getting along
fine all these years.

559
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:49,089
Is this your idea of being understanding?

560
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:52,999
It'd be a different story if you
two didn't love each other.

561
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,539
That's not the case between you two.

562
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,990
What love are you talking about?

563
00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:01,319
Your dad is a sadist who loves to abuse me,

564
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:04,150
and I'm the masochist who suffered
through it and lost self-respect.

565
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:06,719
Both people are mentally ill.

566
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,649
You don't have to be so extreme...

567
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:11,290
What if I lose it and hang myself?

568
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,890
What?

569
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:32,320
- Father, dinner's ready.
- Okay.

570
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:35,320
- Se Hee.
- Yes.

571
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:42,050
- Are you in a lot of pain?
- Yes, it's still there.

572
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:45,219
I don't think octopus soup tastes good.

573
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,920
But it even heals ill cows.

574
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:52,820
It's hot.

575
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:07,220
Thanks to Se Hee, we all
get to eat healthy food.

576
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:10,439
Yu Ri says it's not too good.

577
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,989
Come on, Se Hee!

578
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:14,190
It's not for the taste.
It's for your recovery.

579
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,696
It's so refreshing. What
is she talking about?

580
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:22,050
Let's eat. Let's eat and spring
up to our feet in the morning.

581
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:25,690
Go ahead.

582
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:37,720
- You're so cute.
- What?

583
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:41,850
- Yes.
- It's me, Soo Mi.

584
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:47,669
Congratulations, Kyung Ho.

585
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:49,790
So Hee's finally getting married.

586
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:52,890
Yes, she is. Here.

587
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:56,190
I'm coming from Mother's house. Try this.

588
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,020
They're corns.

589
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:00,050
- See you.
- Hey.

590
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:02,820
I need to talk to you.

591
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,920
What is it?

592
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,920
How nasty were you to your wife?
Look at what she's doing.

593
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:16,020
- What did I do?
- She wants to get a divorce!

594
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:20,009
How did you...

595
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:23,020
She was talking to Hye Kyung
on the phone and cried.

596
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:27,289
Myung Ran wasn't acting like herself.
What did you...

597
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:30,219
It's nothing. I didn't do anything wrong.

598
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:32,889
She woke up one day and was
drinking coffee I made for her...

599
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:35,819
when she exploded and
slammed the door on me.

600
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,919
It was all hysteria...

601
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,889
and she asked for a divorce out of nowhere.

602
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:41,419
Are you serious?

603
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:44,569
Are you saying you didn't do
anything wrong and she did that?

604
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:47,809
Why is this woman spreading the word?

605
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:48,939
Hey!

606
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,629
Don't worry. She should be fine now.

607
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:54,329
She usually lasts for 3 hours.
It's been 6 hours already.

608
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:55,350
Go inside.

609
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,450
Can't you be better?

610
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:01,420
How could I be better than this?

611
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:04,190
Do you think I'm scared?

612
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:16,920
So Hee.

613
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:22,090
Here are some corns.
It's the glutinous ones.

614
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:25,250
Have some corns. I got them from...

615
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:34,750
What are you doing?

616
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,220
Leave.

617
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,409
What did you say?

618
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:43,709
Didn't you hear me? I said to leave.

619
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:46,929
You must be insane. Where would I go?

620
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:48,390
I don't care where you go.

621
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:51,090
Did you think I was joking?

622
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:52,950
Don't underestimate me.

623
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:57,450
Hey, So Hee. What's wrong with your mum?

624
00:34:58,890 --> 00:34:59,890
Leave, Dad.

625
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:03,749
- What?
- You did whatever you wanted...

626
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:05,419
until now, so listen to her for once.

627
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:08,389
- This punk.
- I can't help it but take her side.

628
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:11,459
Mum endured through so much,

629
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:14,180
and she didn't have any regard for
herself while taking care of you.

630
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:17,049
She wants to live without you. Let her go.

631
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:19,560
I didn't do anything wrong today!

632
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,750
Stop talking and leave.

633
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:25,150
No, you didn't do anything wrong.

634
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:27,560
You acted like you always do. You're right.

635
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:31,339
But the trigger went off...

636
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:33,060
while I was recollecting myself.

637
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,520
- Ha Myung Ran!
- Shut it.

638
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,820
What do you know?

639
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:40,399
What?

640
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,350
You said that to me thousands of times.

641
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,190
I get it. I'll...

642
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,350
Look, Kyung Ho.

643
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:50,529
You just say that you get it.

644
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:53,559
I wouldn't have lived miserably,
had it not been for you.

645
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,620
Miserably?

646
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:58,599
- Did I starve you or what?
- Shut it and leave.

647
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,120
What's gotten into you?

648
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,090
Can't you watch your language?

649
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,090
Did I beg you to live with me?

650
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:07,920
Did I say I couldn't live without you?

651
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:10,520
Fine. It's over.

652
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:13,879
Still, you can't tell me to leave.

653
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,899
This is my apartment.

654
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,819
You can do whatever you want
after So Hee gets married.

655
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:20,940
I can't live under the same
roof with you any longer.

656
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:24,150
I'm sick of your footsteps,
breaths and smell.

657
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,560
What if I strangle you
while you're sleeping?

658
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:31,250
I don't know what I'll do when I explode.

659
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:33,619
So just leave.

660
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:34,829
What?

661
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:38,150
Are you trying to threaten me?

662
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:48,020
My goodness.

663
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,299
- Why?
- Where are you going?

664
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,790
- I'm just going out.
- Is your mum crazy?

665
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:08,089
How can you do this?

666
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:10,239
You're the perpetrator,
and Mum is the victim.

667
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,490
You deserve to be punished.

668
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:14,820
Punished?

669
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:16,790
Thank you.

670
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:19,120
Do you think reading is fun?

671
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:20,850
I do.

672
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:24,339
I keep being distracted while reading.

673
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:27,619
After all, nothing remains in my head.

674
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:30,020
Every line seems new when I go back.

675
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:33,409
After repeating that a few
times, I just put away the book.

676
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:35,220
I almost never finish any book.

677
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:37,520
It must be a torture for you.

678
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:40,259
Do you know how to be a good reader?

679
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:43,039
I'm not sure. It just came naturally to me.

680
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,350
I've never thought about
how to be a good reader.

681
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:48,320
I hope Happiness will be smart.

682
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,109
Is it your phone?

683
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:53,420
- Yes, it is.
- Stay here.

684
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,850
It says Na Jae Hyun.

685
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:03,690
Hello.

686
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:07,790
I got cut off.

687
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,560
Call him back.

688
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:11,129
Later.

689
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:13,590
You don't want to be bothered.
That happens.

690
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:18,150
Wait. He has the same last
name with your husband.

691
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:20,690
What do I call his family?

692
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:24,750
He'll be Happiness's uncle.

693
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:27,190
I still don't get it.

694
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:31,289
What were we talking about by the way?

695
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:33,759
- I have no idea.
- Are you going in?

696
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,669
- Yes. I want to lie down.
- Sure.

697
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:38,109
Why don't you take this with you?

698
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:39,690
It's okay.

699
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:42,350
Oh, right. Na Jae Hyun.

700
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:44,750
Na is not a common last name.

701
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,790
Is he related to Hyun Woo?

702
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,139
- Yes.
- Who is it?

703
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,990
You're curious about all kinds of things.

704
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:54,039
I am.

705
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,369
Curious people are often smart.

706
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:58,490
I'm sure Happiness will be smart like you.

707
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:00,690
I hope Happiness takes after Se Hyun.

708
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:02,690
- Take some rest.
- Okay.

709
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:26,529
Ms Yoo.

710
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,190
Yes. Talk to me.

711
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:30,290
Someone else answered the phone.

712
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:32,220
She's my brother's wife.

713
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,359
Did you enjoy your spaghetti?

714
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,220
Yes, it was very tasty.

715
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,720
I ate too much.

716
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:42,620
It looked delicious. It's one
of your dad's specialities.

717
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:46,320
Ms Yoo. I don't feel as lonely as before.

718
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:50,220
That's great. I'm so proud of you.

719
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:52,720
It's all thanks to you.

720
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:55,560
No, it's because you recognised
that I care about you.

721
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:58,769
If you had rejected me,

722
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:00,520
this wouldn't have been possible.

723
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,920
It's all thanks to you.

724
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,290
That's your way to control me.

725
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,989
Control you?

726
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:11,950
Don't you know that has a bad connotation?

727
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:17,789
If you deliberately chose that
word as a joke, that's fine.

728
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:18,890
I'll let it slide.

729
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,390
Okay. Keep up the good work.

730
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,950
I'll talk to you again.

731
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:24,820
Bye.

732
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:30,190
Yes?

733
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:38,399
I'll make you abalone porridge tomorrow.

734
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,729
You're spoiling me.

735
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:42,590
I should call Uncle Min Ho and thank him.

736
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,150
Do that.

737
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:47,399
I hope you get better even
a tiny bit every day.

738
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,520
I am getting better.

739
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:51,569
Reading makes you tired.

740
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:52,820
What else would I do?

741
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:55,990
I'm grateful I didn't hurt my eyes.
It would have been terrible.

742
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,620
By the way,

743
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,060
why did you tell me those things that day?

744
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,420
You never did that before.

745
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:07,020
I don't know, Mum.

746
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:10,590
Leaving those two behind,

747
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:13,420
I felt somewhat proud of myself.

748
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:17,220
But then, all of a sudden,

749
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:20,499
I felt sorry for feeling that way...

750
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:23,060
after leaving you and Dad in shock.

751
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:24,750
That's why...

752
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:28,650
I wanted to flatter you.

753
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:34,650
In the intensive care unit, my
consciousness came and went.

754
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:37,490
Later, I wondered...

755
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:42,790
if my soul had foreseen the future.

756
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,720
Why am I so stupid?

757
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,560
I was just so happy.

758
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:52,120
I bragged to your dad so much.

759
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:57,390
How could you know what'd happen next?

760
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:02,190
Do I have something on my face?

761
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:04,120
It's nothing.

762
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:07,150
I wonder what your dad's doing.

763
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:58,140
Would it be a really good idea...

764
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,560
to get married?

765
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:04,590
Your parents weren't particularly
a happy couple, either.

766
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:07,390
How many couples stay
happy all their lives?

767
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:10,890
We might have to cut each other
some slack for our children...

768
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:14,220
or look after each other
for old time's sake.

769
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:16,220
We'll be all right.

770
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:18,790
What if we want to get a divorce?

771
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:22,710
If that's the best option,
we'll have to choose that.

772
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:24,650
Don't you think?

773
00:43:25,090 --> 00:43:26,959
If you're unhappy in your marriage,

774
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,560
you have to get out of it.

775
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:32,169
Is that what you think?

776
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:35,520
My parents considered
each other a stranger.

777
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:37,970
They thought, "You have your
life, and I have mine."

778
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:41,450
"I'm not you, and you're not me."

779
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:44,289
"Don't try to change me the way you want."

780
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:46,220
"That's just being selfish."

781
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,820
Dad lived his life and Mum hers.

782
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:52,150
I was the victim.

783
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:55,559
I had to grow up alone as a result.

784
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:59,150
I understand all that, but I can't
marry you with a divorce in mind.

785
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:02,390
You don't seem to understand my point.

786
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:05,750
If you have to get a divorce,
that'd be the worst case.

787
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:07,920
My dream is...

788
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:11,650
still making a happy family.

789
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:14,090
I'm really tired of...

790
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:16,490
my dad yelling.

791
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:19,590
But come to think of it,

792
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:21,890
I find myself losing my temper so easily.

793
00:44:22,850 --> 00:44:25,020
I do that especially a lot to Mum.

794
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:29,320
I hate it when Dad looks down on Mum,

795
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:32,120
but I can't say...

796
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:36,190
I've never done that to her.

797
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:39,350
I feel so bad.

798
00:44:40,690 --> 00:44:42,420
I was so mean.

799
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:47,650
So Hee.

800
00:44:47,651 --> 00:44:49,650
Mum must have suffered so much.

801
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:53,620
Why didn't I...

802
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:57,820
think about this before?

803
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:07,020
Honey.

804
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:08,920
Myung Ran.

805
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:11,350
We need to talk.

806
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,320
Ms Ha.

807
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:16,220
Honey.

808
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:19,650
That stubborn old lady.

809
00:45:20,990 --> 00:45:22,390
Open the door!

810
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:24,650
Open it!

811
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:40,420
Gosh. Don't worry.

812
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:42,620
They won't get divorced
after all this time.

813
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:46,459
It means she's very upset.

814
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:49,479
Myung Ran will never be
able to divorce him.

815
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:52,120
- I'll eat my hat if she does.
- Do you think so?

816
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,220
She won't divorce him, right?

817
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:56,549
She used to come to work sulky,

818
00:45:56,550 --> 00:45:59,950
but she became fine when Kyung
Ho said a few words to her.

819
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:02,420
She has put up with him until now...

820
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:06,220
because she is broad-minded. That
won't change. I'm not worried.

821
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:11,450
Gosh. I can't learn golf now.

822
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:16,149
That's not my fault.

823
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:19,850
Gosh. What are you talking about?
Whose fault is it then?

824
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:26,539
She said she will go through
it after we get married.

825
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:28,890
Things will be settled until then.

826
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:33,020
She's upset now, but she will
feel better after a few days.

827
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:35,450
That's what I think and hope.

828
00:46:36,350 --> 00:46:38,020
I don't want to go home.

829
00:46:40,890 --> 00:46:44,450
I'm such a coward. I want to avoid it.

830
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:47,990
Why is my mum home at a time like this?

831
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:50,790
The timing couldn't be worse.

832
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:55,590
- Should we get a hotel room?
- Joon Woo.

833
00:46:57,150 --> 00:46:59,020
I'm not in the mood for that.

834
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:01,250
Fine.

835
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:04,950
What did my dad do?

836
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:08,690
He couldn't get any worse.

837
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:14,090
- Do you think he hit her?
- No. He wouldn't do that.

838
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:15,850
Did he pinch her?

839
00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:18,390
Do you want to die?

840
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:22,590
Don't be so serious. They will be fine.

841
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:33,919
- Hello, Ji Sun?
- I heard you are getting married.

842
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,929
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

843
00:47:35,930 --> 00:47:37,350
Were you asleep?

844
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:42,220
Na Young told me.

845
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:44,589
I was going to call you right away,

846
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:47,650
but I was working and I forgot about it.

847
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:52,020
I sometimes get forgetful. I'm sorry.

848
00:47:54,350 --> 00:47:56,690
It's him, right? Your friend from school.

849
00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:00,090
I thought so.

850
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:02,830
I knew there was something
going on between you two.

851
00:48:04,290 --> 00:48:08,220
Se Hee and I knew you would marry him soon.

852
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:13,990
Please hold on, So Hee.
I have another call.

853
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:16,820
Would you?

854
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,420
Let's talk later then.

855
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:21,590
Bye.

856
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:26,750
Yes, Ji Il.

857
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:30,550
I was on the phone.

858
00:48:36,990 --> 00:48:40,559
My aunt bought these for you as
she was coming from Jeju Island.

859
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:44,290
- This is...
- I have a meeting at 10pm.

860
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:48,320
I would ask you if I could
come inside if I had time.

861
00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:51,129
I'm unlucky. Take these.

862
00:48:51,130 --> 00:48:55,029
No. I'm in no position to
take something like this.

863
00:48:55,030 --> 00:48:57,590
I didn't even have time to park my car.
Come on.

864
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:07,720
Don't work until too late.

865
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:11,490
- Okay.
- You sound half-hearted.

866
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:14,550
What else can I say?

867
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:16,750
"I can take care of myself"?

868
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:22,250
- When are you leaving?
- I'll know after the meeting.

869
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:25,250
- I see.
- You sound half-hearted again.

870
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:29,190
Do you even care about when I'm leaving?

871
00:49:29,590 --> 00:49:31,119
That's...

872
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:33,390
Do you want me to stop
bugging you and leave?

873
00:49:34,290 --> 00:49:36,650
Are you a mind reader? You're good.

874
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:38,920
Come on.

875
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,550
- Please tell her that I thank her.
- Sure.

876
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:50,090
Bye.

877
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:15,150
Where are the keys?

878
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:18,919
You don't know, right? Of
course, you don't know.

879
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:22,220
You never know where things are.

880
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:24,850
Open up. Open the door!

881
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:26,890
Open it now!

882
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:31,020
Do you want me to break the door?
Is that it?

883
00:50:32,890 --> 00:50:33,920
Myung Ran.

884
00:50:34,650 --> 00:50:35,720
Ma'am.

885
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:40,120
I need clothes to change into!

886
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:42,550
Dummy!

887
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:45,569
- Get out.
- Gosh.

888
00:50:45,570 --> 00:50:49,020
- Stop acting so stupid and get out!
- Goodness!

889
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:52,619
- You might kill me with that.
- Get out if you don't want to die.

890
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:55,349
Get out, you jerk! Get out!

891
00:50:55,350 --> 00:50:59,320
- Get out!
- I'm sorry. Don't get worked up.

892
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:13,320
Calm down before I call the police.

893
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:08,750
I wish I can hire someone just like Soo Mi.

894
00:52:11,150 --> 00:52:13,950
If I had known, I wouldn't
have arranged their marriage.

895
00:52:15,150 --> 00:52:17,550
I didn't know I was digging my own grave.

896
00:52:21,850 --> 00:52:23,720
Miss Shin wouldn't be enough, right?

897
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:30,790
You just had to wake me up.

898
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:37,550
Aren't you worried?

899
00:52:38,390 --> 00:52:39,620
Gosh.

900
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:48,920
What is it?

901
00:52:49,890 --> 00:52:52,520
- Are you home?
- Not yet.

902
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:56,350
Your mum is crazy. We should
take her to the hospital.

903
00:52:56,690 --> 00:52:59,450
She's smashing down things.
I think she lost her mind.

904
00:52:59,790 --> 00:53:02,290
- She kicked me out, So Hee.
- Just leave her alone.

905
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:05,590
Where would I sleep? I have nowhere to go.

906
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:10,120
- You can sleep at your restaurant.
- My restaurant?

907
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:13,020
That's true.

908
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:15,690
Right. I can go there.

909
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:17,690
All right.

910
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:21,390
Hey. Are you just going
to sit back and watch?

911
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:24,690
Come home and do something about your mum.

912
00:53:26,590 --> 00:53:28,650
Hello? So Hee?

913
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:33,890
Fine. I'm good.

914
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:36,620
Do what you have to do. Darn it.

915
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:05,590
- Stop. It's too much.
- I'll put a little bit more.

916
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:08,390
It won't taste good if you
put too much. Stop it.

917
00:54:08,890 --> 00:54:10,420
Do you want me to throw this away?

918
00:54:10,950 --> 00:54:13,029
I told you not to make too much.

919
00:54:13,030 --> 00:54:15,050
Just hold still.

920
00:54:15,790 --> 00:54:18,320
He eats anything I make for him.

921
00:54:18,850 --> 00:54:21,520
He says it's hard to eat
everything to please you.

922
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:24,719
- Really?
- Stop feeding him too much.

923
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,320
Gosh. That's so nice of him.

924
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:29,490
Did he eat it for me?

925
00:54:30,990 --> 00:54:33,669
- Se Joon.
- Yes. I'm coming.

926
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:35,950
- Hurry up and come out.
- I'm here.

927
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:39,339
- You should eat it while it's hot.
- Okay.

928
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:40,350
Take a seat.

929
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:45,399
Don't try hard to please me.

930
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:47,450
Eat as much as you want.

931
00:54:47,790 --> 00:54:48,950
It's okay.

932
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:51,990
Okay, Mother.

933
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:54,890
- Mum.
- Yes. I'll have only one glass.

934
00:54:57,020 --> 00:54:59,659
How was today, Se Joon?

935
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:03,590
- Yes. It was good.
- Gosh. I told you not to do that.

936
00:55:04,690 --> 00:55:06,250
- Let's drink.
- Okay.

937
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:10,799
- Cheers.
- Let's go!

938
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:11,990
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

939
00:55:17,850 --> 00:55:19,550
- Eat this.
- Okay.

940
00:55:21,650 --> 00:55:24,590
- Mum. Let him eat on his own.
- All right.

941
00:55:25,550 --> 00:55:26,950
How is it? Is it good?

942
00:55:29,690 --> 00:55:32,869
Se Joon. My friend said...

943
00:55:32,870 --> 00:55:35,990
travelling to South America is tiring.

944
00:55:36,490 --> 00:55:39,469
I heard it's over 30 hours of flight.

945
00:55:39,470 --> 00:55:42,519
Yes. Even if it's a direct flight,
it takes 25 hours in the air.

946
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:44,160
It's 30 hours including the waiting time.

947
00:55:44,990 --> 00:55:47,389
Exactly. Don't you think it's too much?

948
00:55:47,390 --> 00:55:48,790
How's the security there?

949
00:55:49,350 --> 00:55:52,419
Why don't you start with Asia?

950
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:53,779
You can start off somewhere close.

951
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:55,019
Mum.

952
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:57,839
Why are you worrying about it already?

953
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:00,269
And it's not something
for you to worry about.

954
00:56:00,270 --> 00:56:03,150
I know, but I'm...

955
00:56:03,490 --> 00:56:04,650
still worried.

956
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:07,990
Travelling alone might sound easy.

957
00:56:08,450 --> 00:56:10,469
But why would you do it?

958
00:56:10,470 --> 00:56:13,269
I still don't understand, Se Joon.

959
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:15,819
I know. My parents said the same thing.

960
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:17,220
They still probably think the same.

961
00:56:18,390 --> 00:56:21,009
It's been his dream since middle school.
Nobody can stop him.

962
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:22,889
The only way to stop him...

963
00:56:22,890 --> 00:56:26,820
is for you to get pregnant with triplets.

964
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:28,250
- What?
- Sorry?

965
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:32,290
The phone is turned off. Please
leave a message after the beep.

966
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:40,050
Let's talk first, Myung Ran.

967
00:56:40,590 --> 00:56:42,050
Let's talk it out.

968
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:45,589
I still don't know why you're acting...

969
00:56:45,590 --> 00:56:48,359
like this all of a sudden,

970
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:50,089
but let's try to communicate.

971
00:56:50,090 --> 00:56:51,890
(Let's try to communicate.)

972
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:04,169
I'm scared that something
bizarre is going on...

973
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:05,490
in your brain.

974
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:08,650
Let's go to the hospital tomorrow
to get your brain scanned.

975
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:42,790
Who is it?

976
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:46,020
It's me. Sleep.

977
00:57:46,590 --> 00:57:47,650
What is it, Mum?

978
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:49,490
I'm going to sleep next to you.

979
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:52,050
Let's go to bed.

980
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:04,650
Medical school is so arduous...

981
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:07,390
that she struggled so much with it.

982
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:11,799
And we never pressured
her to become a doctor.

983
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:12,820
Yes.

984
00:58:13,290 --> 00:58:15,839
The fact that parents force
their kids into a profession...

985
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:17,920
is to satisfy their desires.

986
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:20,790
Being a nurse is such a great occupation.

987
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:22,720
When I see So Hee,

988
00:58:23,490 --> 00:58:25,899
she's so agile and detailed.

989
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:28,689
I think it's a perfect job for her.

990
00:58:28,690 --> 00:58:30,520
Thank you for your compliment.

991
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:33,520
She comes from a big family.

992
00:58:33,950 --> 00:58:38,519
So Hee is not impolite or impudent.

993
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:40,890
She's not selfish.

994
00:58:41,990 --> 00:58:45,720
I heard that from Joon Woo. He
told so much about it already.

995
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:48,309
Young women are only concerned
about themselves these days,

996
00:58:48,310 --> 00:58:50,369
but she's not like them.
He likes that about her.

997
00:58:50,370 --> 00:58:53,490
Yes, she'll never stab somebody's back.

998
00:58:55,390 --> 00:58:59,220
I know she'll try her best
with everything she does.

999
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:05,429
I'm just thankful that she
agreed to get married to him.

1000
00:59:05,430 --> 00:59:09,350
On top of that, she is such a good girl.
I must be so lucky.

1001
00:59:10,190 --> 00:59:12,220
You're so generous to say that.

1002
00:59:15,050 --> 00:59:18,320
My late husband used to tell me that
I say things right but that's all.

1003
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:20,589
Sorry?

1004
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:23,150
Oh, right. You're filing a divorce?

1005
00:59:24,650 --> 00:59:26,529
How...

1006
00:59:26,530 --> 00:59:28,020
I heard that from So Hee.

1007
00:59:28,450 --> 00:59:32,720
She said you endured all these years
with irreconcilable differences.

1008
00:59:33,190 --> 00:59:35,390
You should have done it earlier.

1009
00:59:38,090 --> 00:59:41,820
But it's better late than never.

1010
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:43,920
Life is short.

1011
00:59:44,490 --> 00:59:45,790
You lived through most of it.

1012
00:59:46,490 --> 00:59:48,089
I couldn't agree more.

1013
00:59:48,090 --> 00:59:49,720
Proceed with the divorce.

1014
00:59:51,190 --> 00:59:53,550
Yes, I'm planning to.

1015
00:59:55,590 --> 00:59:58,120
I appreciate your understanding.

1016
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:01,709
You should visit the States
when you get a chance.

1017
01:00:01,710 --> 01:00:04,150
I'll introduce you to a gentleman.

1018
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:12,990
Mum says you can do whatever you want.

1019
01:00:13,790 --> 01:00:15,159
I can't do that.

1020
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:17,609
It's okay. Even if she visits Korea,
she's going to stay at hotels.

1021
01:00:17,610 --> 01:00:18,990
This is all ours.

1022
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:21,629
It's all yours.

1023
01:00:21,630 --> 01:00:23,650
It's not like it's going
to be a joint ownership.

1024
01:00:24,390 --> 01:00:26,450
Do you want it to be? That's not difficult.

1025
01:00:28,790 --> 01:00:30,390
Luck is on my side.

1026
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:32,209
It's not luck.

1027
01:00:32,210 --> 01:00:34,050
I thought I was going to die single.

1028
01:00:34,450 --> 01:00:37,519
For all the blind dates I went to,

1029
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:40,029
I had only terrible guys.

1030
01:00:40,030 --> 01:00:42,120
I thought luck was never on my side.

1031
01:00:43,190 --> 01:00:45,539
You didn't know I was next in line.

1032
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:48,490
We are going to get married now.

1033
01:00:49,090 --> 01:00:50,899
I don't even have to worry about in-laws.

1034
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:52,779
What a good timing, too.

1035
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:55,250
My mother-in-law is going to live overseas.

1036
01:00:55,690 --> 01:00:57,770
And everybody starts off
with debt in the beginning,

1037
01:00:58,150 --> 01:00:59,520
but look how lucky I am.

1038
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:01,650
My fiancé is a fool, though.

1039
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:03,650
A fool? Me?

1040
01:01:04,750 --> 01:01:08,390
Let's renovate our house
with half the budget.

1041
01:01:10,350 --> 01:01:12,720
This is too fancy.

1042
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:14,950
I like this company.

1043
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:18,150
You like this one? I like it, too.

1044
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:19,889
- See you again!
- Thank you!

1045
01:01:19,890 --> 01:01:22,889
- One ureok maeuntang, please.
- One ureok maeuntang!

1046
01:01:22,890 --> 01:01:25,529
Did you enjoy your meal?

1047
01:01:25,530 --> 01:01:26,970
- It's for table number two.
- Yes.

1048
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:32,149
- Thank you. Bye.
- Enjoy your meal.

1049
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:33,599
- Hello.
- Welcome.

1050
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:34,849
- Hey.
- Welcome!

1051
01:01:34,850 --> 01:01:36,799
- Please get them seated.
- Welcome!

1052
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:37,950
Please follow me.

1053
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:40,450
Hello, Aunt.

1054
01:01:42,090 --> 01:01:43,690
I thought you stopped working.

1055
01:01:45,020 --> 01:01:46,409
Where's Myung Ran?

1056
01:01:46,410 --> 01:01:48,420
Well... She...

1057
01:01:49,090 --> 01:01:51,229
She's meeting So Hee's
future mother-in-law.

1058
01:01:51,230 --> 01:01:52,250
I see.

1059
01:01:52,890 --> 01:01:55,879
Mr Kwon. Can I have some
seasoning for maeuntang?

1060
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:59,379
Sure. Seasoning for maeuntang, please!

1061
01:01:59,380 --> 01:02:01,509
- Sure.
- Octopus jeotgal as well.

1062
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:04,090
- Octopus jeotgal as well!
- Sure.

1063
01:02:06,290 --> 01:02:08,159
Did I do something wrong?

1064
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:09,450
Why are you not saying hi?

1065
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:16,320
Do you not want to give them to me?
Should I pay for them?

1066
01:02:16,790 --> 01:02:17,890
No, that's not it.

1067
01:02:18,950 --> 01:02:20,020
What is it then?

1068
01:02:21,990 --> 01:02:24,520
What's the whole point of having family?

1069
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:27,639
When it comes to nothing big,
you always gather around...

1070
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:29,490
and create a big scene.

1071
01:02:29,890 --> 01:02:33,119
Why are you guys turning a blind
eye to my family's affair?

1072
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:36,150
- That came out of the blue.
- Aunt.

1073
01:02:36,590 --> 01:02:37,590
Aunt.

1074
01:02:39,090 --> 01:02:41,220
Come out. Come out, Aunt.

1075
01:02:46,290 --> 01:02:48,090
What's he talking about?

1076
01:02:49,420 --> 01:02:52,289
Myung Ran asked for a divorce. She's
not coming to work for six days.

1077
01:02:52,290 --> 01:02:53,320
What?

1078
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:55,899
Sook Ja!

1079
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:58,150
Sook Ja, we have a problem!

1080
01:03:00,090 --> 01:03:01,490
Kyung Ho is getting divorced.

1081
01:03:01,950 --> 01:03:04,350
Kyung Ho is getting divorced, Jong Chul.

1082
01:03:28,450 --> 01:03:30,150
(That's the Way It Is)

1083
01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:33,179
This is so nice.

1084
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:35,519
Aren't you thankful that
I'm always by your side?

1085
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:36,909
Aren't you happy you got married to me?

1086
01:03:36,910 --> 01:03:39,179
- What brings you here?
- I'm on my way to the airport.

1087
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:40,739
I'm getting transferred
faster than I expected.

1088
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:42,220
It's all my fault.

1089
01:03:42,620 --> 01:03:44,579
I don't want to deal with this any more.

1090
01:03:44,580 --> 01:03:45,690
After So Hee gets married,

1091
01:03:46,290 --> 01:03:47,779
I'll file the divorce, Mother.

1092
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:51,190
Your heart might be broken, but
all my organs are rotting away.

1093
01:03:52,190 --> 01:03:53,550
What's wrong, Mother?

1094
01:03:53,990 --> 01:03:55,939
- Can't you sleep here today?
- You must be crazy!

1095
01:03:55,940 --> 01:03:58,120
- We're getting married.
- Don't even think about it.
