unique ability in staging.

When Ye-dam's performance
is combined with it...

ruins this stage...

Ye-dam is taking
off his bracelet.

I would've teamed them with Je-hyung.

- Raccoon Boys did it.
- Oh, I see.

619
00:49:45,170 --> 00:49:47,900
We can just ask them.

620
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:50,080
You potential will be released
if you work with us.

621
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:52,820
Our potential has to be
released and not others.

622
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:55,170
Only your potential
need to be released.

623
00:49:57,030 --> 00:49:59,140
Is there a song
you have in mind?

624
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:01,820
It's a pop song.
Rihanna and...

625
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:02,960
- Eminem?
- Yes.

626
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:08,070
"Love the Way You Lie"?

627
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,440
I really love this song.

628
00:50:16,110 --> 00:50:19,510
It was a collaboration between
Rihanna and Eminem, right?

629
00:50:19,510 --> 00:50:21,560
Then Il-do's Eminem?

630
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:27,990
We looked for a song where Lee Hi's
and Hyo-bin's voice went along.

631
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:30,740
We sang this and
it suited us.

632
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:36,820
I'll sing until the
note over here.

633
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:41,250
[She was a high schooler a year
ago. Now she's a senior artist]

634
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:47,100
Her musical interpretation
is remarkable for her age.

635
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:51,110
That mature sensibilty is what's
going to polish this song.

636
00:50:51,110 --> 00:50:53,840
And it will go along with
2,000 won's sensibility.

637
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:56,500
We'll show a great stage.

638
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:59,060
Cheer us so that
we can be first.

639
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:00,460
Please watch.

640
00:51:03,990 --> 00:51:06,680
[Both Akdong Musician and
Baek A-yeon are nervous]

641

[It's been a while since we
saw those eyes on Lee Hi]

became fuller]

hearing Lee Hi's voice]

645

[Hyo-bin's mournful falsetto
filled with a lonely feeling]

piercing the heart]

647

[They're absorbed
as if possessed]

648

[As if watching a
scene from a movie]

[This stage conveyed
some deep sentiments]

650

00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:49,690
[They're really good]

652
00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:53,780
"Love the Way You Lie"
by Lee Hi and 2,000 won.

653
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:57,000
- Who chose this song?
- Lee Hi did.

654
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:05,420
The harmony and rap in the
middle... whose idea was it?

655
00:55:05,420 --> 00:55:06,730
It was Lee Hi.

656
00:55:06,730 --> 00:55:08,760
- Lee Hi's idea?
- She did everything.

657
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:15,140
2,000 won left everything to
her who is six years younger.

658
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:17,120
Well, she's Lee Hi.

659
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:22,100
Shin Ji-hoon was in
awe. How was it?

660
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:30,210
I had the chills when I heard
Hyo-bin and Hi's voices.

661
00:55:30,210 --> 00:55:32,390
- The chills?
- Yes.

662
00:55:32,390 --> 00:55:37,400
- I thought we lost.
- Since they sing well...

663
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:40,240
What will be the results?

664
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:45,280
The 100 people will
press the buttons!

665

[They're busier than ever]

666
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:54,130
[Will they be the
new first place?]

667
00:55:54,130 --> 00:56:04,600
Will Baek and Shin lose their
place? Let's see the results!

668
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:08,570
The score's going up.

They took first! Another
round of applause.

675
00:56:41,290 --> 00:56:48,460
Because we were with her, our
shrunken heart opened up.

676
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:49,910
We're not afraid
with her.

677
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:55,900
I was more nervous than receiving
good commentaries on the show.

678
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:59,510
- This is more nerve-racking.
- My mouth went dry.

679
00:56:59,510 --> 00:57:02,640
I'm very happy.
It's such an honor.

680

- You did it like Miss Korea.
- It's an honor. I mean...

681
00:57:06,050 --> 00:57:10,740
Anyways, first is 2,000 won and Lee Hi!
Another round of applause for them!

I can't imagine Park Ji-min
singing "Don't Cross Your Legs".

691
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:56,800
But I can't imagine Lee Soo-hyun
singing "Rolling in the Deep".

692
00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:01,730
The two songs are different. How will
they mix it? I'm looking forward to it.

relying on Lee Hi!

01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:58,410
I return to my place and will
try harder to show a better self.
