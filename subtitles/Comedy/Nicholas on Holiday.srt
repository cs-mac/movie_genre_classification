LITTLE NICHOLAS ON HOLLIDAY

2
00:02:33,271 --> 00:02:37,055
... so now we are
of this school at the end,

3
00:02:37,859 --> 00:02:40,979
I can inform you proudly

4
00:02:41,154 --> 00:02:42,732
we again...

5
00:02:43,031 --> 00:02:46,151
true to Jules Ferry ,

6
00:02:46,326 --> 00:02:49,944
dirty beast to have overtaken in his den
,

7
00:02:50,247 --> 00:02:53,947
in the shadows lurks
and is responsible for all the evil

8
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:57,162
and all wars,
the beast named

9
00:02:57,337 --> 00:02:59,211
Ignorance.

10
00:02:59,548 --> 00:03:03,380
Constantly we have the noble sword

11
00:03:03,844 --> 00:03:07,509
lifted her of teaching,

12
00:03:07,681 --> 00:03:09,887
and thus fulfilled the mandate

13
00:03:10,183 --> 00:03:13,469
and ours
beautiful and amazing institute

14
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:17,020
the Republic School !

15
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:21,022
Because, as courage and virtue are the two legs

16
00:03:21,403 --> 00:03:25,270
where the man his name
worthy to rest

17
00:03:25,448 --> 00:03:29,778
he owes that solely...

18
00:03:30,287 --> 00:03:32,160
his schooling. ..

19
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:38,992
... And hoping that you
will think about these words

20
00:03:39,296 --> 00:03:43,424
I wish you, dear children,
happy holidays!

21
00:03:49,097 --> 00:03:52,217
Do not forget to make your home work!

22
00:03:58,064 --> 00:04:00,520
Hello, guys, calm down...

23
00:04:11,536 --> 00:04:13,493
Thank you, Mr. Director.

24
00:04:17,542 --> 00:04:20,828
And Bouillo... Mr. Dubon,
where you go on holiday?

25
00:04:21,129 --> 00:04:25,043
Ah no, this year I stay in Paris.
Nice home, very quiet.

26
00:04:25,217 --> 00:04:27,174
That's a real vacation.

27
00:04:29,888 --> 00:04:31,631
Mama?
- Yes, sweetheart?

28
00:04:31,807 --> 00:04:34,344
Where are we going this year
go on holiday?

29
00:04:35,268 --> 00:04:37,344
I have not yet
discussed with dad.

30
00:04:38,605 --> 00:04:41,606
<I> Every year, mom and dad arguing </ i>
<i> about where we go </ i>

31
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,569
... Because it is better because...
<i> - And every year it's a hassle </ i>

32
00:04:44,861 --> 00:04:46,653
No, we're going to...
- To the sea.!

33
00:04:46,947 --> 00:04:48,571
No, we go to the mountains!
- We go to the sea!

34
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:52,156
<I> I do not know why they do that every time, </ i>
<i> because ultimately it is always the same </ i>

35
00:04:52,452 --> 00:04:53,946
We go to the mountains!
- We go to the sea!

36
00:04:55,664 --> 00:04:56,944
Come on!

37
00:04:57,499 --> 00:04:58,661
What?

38
00:04:58,834 --> 00:05:00,910
Shoot!
- Yeah, yeah...

39
00:05:02,003 --> 00:05:05,455
<i> But this time it's gone very differently </ i>
<i> than usual </ i>

40
00:05:07,842 --> 00:05:11,792
I warn you right away,
this year. we go to sea and not otherwise.

41
00:05:12,848 --> 00:05:14,757
That & apos; s good.
- Excuse Me Please?

42
00:05:15,058 --> 00:05:17,929
I think it's good. We go to sea.
And mama goes along.

43
00:05:19,312 --> 00:05:21,768
<I> Mommy Mommy, that's omi </ i>

44
00:05:22,607 --> 00:05:26,107
<i> They always want a kiss from me </ i>
- Kiss..!

45
00:05:29,447 --> 00:05:32,863
<I> The only omi never gives a kiss, </ i>
<i> dad </ i>.

46
00:05:33,451 --> 00:05:37,070
Do not bother especially, omi, I'll look
another chair, another newspaper.

47
00:05:37,873 --> 00:05:39,580
Oh, kiss!

48
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:43,664
<I> Dad finds it particularly irritating </ i>
<i> when the conversation is about Georges </ i>

49
00:05:43,837 --> 00:05:46,410
... Who I ran into yesterday?
Georges!

50
00:05:46,715 --> 00:05:49,420
<I> Georges is a gentleman who has met mom </ i>
<i> when she was little </ i>

51
00:05:49,593 --> 00:05:52,262
<i> and she was almost married to, </ i>
<i> before she met Dad </ i>

52
00:05:52,554 --> 00:05:55,839
<i> Apparently he was very handsome, </ i>
<i> very rich and very intelligent </ i>

53
00:05:56,141 --> 00:05:58,762
He is still so terribly attentive,
that luscious hair...

54
00:05:58,935 --> 00:06:02,020
<i> And when they talk about him, then </ i>
<i> she always ends her sentences with a sigh </ i>

55
00:06:05,108 --> 00:06:07,682
Yeah big boy,
I know you'll be a man.

56
00:06:08,278 --> 00:06:10,650
And I hope that I
may experience yet.

57
00:06:10,947 --> 00:06:13,699
Oh, I'm not worried about it, omi.
You bury us all!

58
00:06:25,003 --> 00:06:28,454
A sweet, sweetheart?
<I> - But I think it's fine as Omi's </ i>

59
00:06:28,757 --> 00:06:31,923
That's again enough candy, anyway.?
- Dad's right.

60
00:06:32,219 --> 00:06:34,092
You should not eat too many sweets,
you know.

61
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:37,136
Come on, the last.

62
00:06:38,099 --> 00:06:39,677
The last!

63
00:06:39,851 --> 00:06:41,725
But that was the last but one.

64
00:06:44,397 --> 00:06:47,102
You see, huh?
& Apos; yet a sweet, honey & apos?;

65
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,476
I have warned you anyway ?!

66
00:06:50,445 --> 00:06:53,529
I think it's through that pipe that poor lad is ill.

67
00:06:53,824 --> 00:06:55,199
Here you get within
almost no air!

68
00:06:55,367 --> 00:06:58,403
It is true that smoke
not it will do much good.

69
00:07:15,637 --> 00:07:16,917
Omi take on holiday?

70
00:07:17,222 --> 00:07:19,013
Really no!
- Why is that?

71
00:07:19,182 --> 00:07:22,468
The word & apos; Omi & apos; and the word & apos; & apos holidays;
in the same sense it & apos; s contradiction in terms.

72
00:07:22,853 --> 00:07:24,892
Good, excellent.
Then we pay a young girl.

73
00:07:25,063 --> 00:07:27,186
A young girl, for what?
- To fit Nicholas!

74
00:07:27,482 --> 00:07:30,234
Who will guard him
if we & apos; at night to go out?

75
00:07:30,527 --> 00:07:33,362
And who makes sure that he gets his breakfast
if we & apos; s morning to sleep in?

76
00:07:33,655 --> 00:07:36,111
So that will be one franc 50 per hour,
no one franc 70

77
00:07:36,283 --> 00:07:39,948
it is much more expensive during the holidays.
Yup? So one franc 70...

78
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,990
three times,
three times a week and then...

79
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:46,160
Yes, yes, it's not fair, what you do.
It's not fair and repulsive!

80
00:07:46,835 --> 00:07:49,290
And old people all summer
leave in the city

81
00:07:49,462 --> 00:07:52,666
with that tremendous heat without someone to talk to
, that you do not find repulsive?

82
00:07:52,966 --> 00:07:57,046
Prima! I am willing to take an adult
on vacation. But not omi.

83
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:01,640
Hello, Marie-Edwige.
- Hello.

84
00:08:02,642 --> 00:08:05,846
I can not talk to you long
because I'm going on vacation so.

85
00:08:06,021 --> 00:08:08,428
And... where are you going?
- To the sea.

86
00:08:08,607 --> 00:08:11,892
We go to Chamonix,
to Hotel du Grand Soleil.

87
00:08:13,737 --> 00:08:15,445
You can write to me if you want.

88
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:20,193
Yes, then...

89
00:08:20,952 --> 00:08:22,696
Happy holidays!

90
00:08:25,832 --> 00:08:29,201
Marie-Edwige,
would you marry Nicholas

91
00:08:29,503 --> 00:08:32,254
captain who is on a warship
and who earns a lot of money?

92
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:34,965
Yes!

93
00:08:43,808 --> 00:08:46,679
... I'll meet you, sir
but again not satisfied!

94
00:08:46,853 --> 00:08:48,478
<I> Dear Marie-Edwige, </ i>

95
00:08:48,647 --> 00:08:50,438
<i> since the last time </ i>
<i> we've seen each other, </ i>

96
00:08:50,607 --> 00:08:52,813
<i> have I thought about you all the time... </ i>

97
00:08:53,151 --> 00:08:54,942
And now stop, that's enough!

98
00:08:55,237 --> 00:08:56,861
We're going on vacation without omi!

99
00:09:07,415 --> 00:09:09,373
Hemeltje sweet!

100
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:14,505
Is it really too much to ask to open a window
do for some fresh air?

101
00:09:14,673 --> 00:09:17,211
Or would you like to see us melt?

102
00:09:18,885 --> 00:09:21,174
No, but now I ask you

103
00:09:21,346 --> 00:09:24,015
what we do here, this is hopeless!

104
00:09:24,516 --> 00:09:26,923
If there is only one way in France.

105
00:09:29,437 --> 00:09:30,932
Oh my goodness...

106
00:09:31,606 --> 00:09:34,228
I'm sorry that I'm doing this holiday.
- Mommy!

107
00:09:36,278 --> 00:09:37,688
I'm hungry.
- Hold on, Nicholas!

108
00:09:37,862 --> 00:09:41,777
I do not want to be annoying, but if
cooler was not put in the trunk,

109
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:44,358
I could give a banana to Nicholas.
- Oh yes, a banana!

110
00:09:44,619 --> 00:09:46,411
No! We would go picnicking,
so we have a picnic!

111
00:09:46,705 --> 00:09:49,160
And for this we must first of this file!

112
00:09:49,457 --> 00:09:50,952
Hopla!

113
00:09:56,631 --> 00:09:59,205
Beware, beware still on!
Soon we are all sick!

114
00:09:59,384 --> 00:10:01,377
Yes! Dad, you're the best!

115
00:10:01,553 --> 00:10:04,305
That's what I call at least make a decision.

116
00:10:04,598 --> 00:10:06,721
Look! They all do our post!

117
00:10:27,412 --> 00:10:29,156
What is this now?

118
00:10:29,414 --> 00:10:31,987
It is a cow.
That's a cow.

119
00:10:32,167 --> 00:10:34,872
Never seen before?
- Hey, hey, Nicholas!

120
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:37,328
That's what happens when you think
you're smarter than the rest...

121
00:10:37,631 --> 00:10:40,335
Why did you bring us back here?

122
00:10:40,634 --> 00:10:43,469
This is unbelievable!
- You see that it has been blocked for ?!

123
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,555
Oh, come on! Come on, do something!

124
00:10:52,103 --> 00:10:53,847
Where are you going now ?!

125
00:10:54,147 --> 00:10:57,065
Look at what you do!
- Do not you worry, I can do this.

126
00:11:07,828 --> 00:11:10,994
And there, daddy, that's not a good place for a picnic
?

127
00:11:38,567 --> 00:11:41,733
That's what I told him. Okay.

128
00:11:41,903 --> 00:11:44,062
Sorry.
Fine, thank you, sir.

129
00:11:45,115 --> 00:11:47,191
Can you come, please?
There is a problem.

130
00:11:47,367 --> 00:11:49,858
You have not reserved a room for omi!
- Nicholas, please.

131
00:11:50,036 --> 00:11:52,741
Apparently there is no room
reserved for mom.

132
00:11:52,914 --> 00:11:54,622
What is this nonsense ?!

133
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:57,116
I'm sure I have booked three rooms
, two with a connecting door.

134
00:11:57,294 --> 00:11:59,701
I just called the agency,
they say no.

135
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,501
For me anyway reserved
but two rooms, not three.

136
00:12:03,884 --> 00:12:06,671
I do not understand.
- It makes sense. I have sometimes.

137
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:08,927
If I have to do what I do not want to,

138
00:12:09,097 --> 00:12:11,386
I think I did it,
but I did not do it.

139
00:12:12,475 --> 00:12:14,883
Well, here is another place for me
or I go back home?

140
00:12:15,061 --> 00:12:18,228
Nicholas shares his room with Mommy,
arranged.

141
00:12:19,566 --> 00:12:22,235
The phone call, you want to pay now or
I put it on the bill?

142
00:12:22,527 --> 00:12:25,564
On the account.
- Very Well.

143
00:12:27,407 --> 00:12:29,779
What is that heavy suitcase!

144
00:12:59,439 --> 00:13:02,938
Honey, I think it
is a fantastic holiday.

145
00:13:32,848 --> 00:13:35,339
Mommy! Mommy!

146
00:13:40,689 --> 00:13:42,728
Walk me not for the feet!

147
00:13:52,867 --> 00:13:56,735
Ms.
... Sir... - Thank you, ma'am.

148
00:14:07,841 --> 00:14:09,833
Just arrived? Nice to meet you.

149
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,634
Colonel Dubourtoumieux.
- Pleasant.

150
00:14:11,928 --> 00:14:14,051
You should know that this morning...
- Well, are you coming?

151
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:16,714
Aye! Ladies...

152
00:14:19,644 --> 00:14:22,218
He might colonel,
but at home he is not the boss.

153
00:14:23,064 --> 00:14:24,440
Well, one again.

154
00:14:27,152 --> 00:14:29,310
Georges Except, of course.
- Mom, what do you want as a starter?

155
00:14:29,613 --> 00:14:32,732
What raw?
- Ah, that was once a man. A real...

156
00:14:32,908 --> 00:14:35,233
Elegant, refined,

157
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:37,403
courteous, generous,

158
00:14:37,579 --> 00:14:40,152
charming! Remember how he was sporting
, sweetheart?

159
00:14:40,457 --> 00:14:42,165
You might want beetroot, celery salad
?

160
00:14:42,459 --> 00:14:45,032
He even won a gold medal,
the French tennis champion.

161
00:14:45,212 --> 00:14:46,872
From Normandy, Mom.

162
00:14:47,047 --> 00:14:49,086
And it was ping pong.

163
00:14:49,299 --> 00:14:50,544
Also good.
- Yup.

164
00:14:50,842 --> 00:14:53,796
Excuse me, I might borrow
the salt, please?

165
00:14:54,095 --> 00:14:56,468
But of course!
<I> - Danke schön </ i>

166
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:00,056
Also, mustard, pepper, maybe.?
<I> - Nein, danke </ i>

167
00:15:05,315 --> 00:15:08,269
What.?
- Give her immediately Alsace and Lorraine.

168
00:15:08,568 --> 00:15:10,395
Come on, that is lackluster.

169
00:15:12,656 --> 00:15:14,613
Well, we will order?

170
00:15:14,908 --> 00:15:17,778
What do you want, Nicholas?
- No pull.

171
00:15:34,719 --> 00:15:36,379
Is anyone there?

172
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:47,308
Is anyone there?

173
00:15:51,945 --> 00:15:53,605
Is anyone there ?!

174
00:15:55,282 --> 00:15:56,990
Is anyone there ?!

175
00:15:57,158 --> 00:15:58,985
Is anyone there ?!

176
00:15:59,578 --> 00:16:01,451
Is anyone there ?!

177
00:16:03,832 --> 00:16:05,540
Is anyone there ?!

178
00:16:06,001 --> 00:16:07,958
Is anyone there ?!

179
00:16:12,716 --> 00:16:15,551
Omi snore, I can not sleep.

180
00:16:15,719 --> 00:16:18,885
Omi sleeps, it sounds like a tractor.
- Concentrate on sleep

181
00:16:19,055 --> 00:16:21,843
than it succeeds within five minutes.
So, hup.

182
00:16:22,142 --> 00:16:25,096
What was wrong with him?
- Nothing At All. Go to sleep.

183
00:16:32,444 --> 00:16:36,026
I can not concentrate on sleep,
for now it sounds like a tractor

184
00:16:36,197 --> 00:16:38,867
whose engine is stalling,
only omi stores never finished.

185
00:16:39,534 --> 00:16:40,779
Bowl.
- Oh no!

186
00:16:40,952 --> 00:16:43,277
But he can not sleep...

187
00:18:42,032 --> 00:18:44,819
<i> The seven, seven, </ i>
<i> heard you </ i>

188
00:18:44,993 --> 00:18:47,745
<i> Of the seven leap </ i>
<i> He says I can not dance </ i>

189
00:18:47,913 --> 00:18:50,830

<i> That's one... </ i>

191
00:19:14,856 --> 00:19:17,810
<i> Dear Marie-Edwige, I hope </ i>

192
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:21,315

193
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,117
<i> At least, almost every day </ i>

194
00:19:29,204 --> 00:19:31,777
<i> In any case, </ i>
<i> I have a lot of friends </ i>

195
00:19:31,957 --> 00:19:33,415
Blaise, walking I do not for the feet!

196
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:36,205
<I> You've Blaise, who is not on vacation </ i>
<i> because they live here </ i>

197
00:19:36,378 --> 00:19:37,836
Hotel Beau Rivage, hello?

198
00:19:39,047 --> 00:19:41,372
Blaise, do not walk in my way!

199
00:19:44,094 --> 00:19:46,845
<I> Then there is Crépin, who cries all the time </ i>

200
00:19:47,013 --> 00:19:50,678
Crépin, why are you crying?
- They took my shovel!

201
00:19:53,603 --> 00:19:57,435
Crépin, why are you crying?
- They do not want to play with me!

202
00:19:57,732 --> 00:20:00,686
Crépin, why are you crying?
- I do not know!

203
00:20:01,903 --> 00:20:04,275
<I> You have Djodjo </ i>
<i> Djodjo and his parents </ i>

204
00:20:04,447 --> 00:20:07,021
<I> came here </ i>
<i> because their is no sun . </ i>

205
00:20:07,325 --> 00:20:09,282
Hi, my name Djodjo

206
00:20:09,452 --> 00:20:12,868
and I come from Stratford-upon-Avon,
the city of Shakespeare.

207
00:20:13,165 --> 00:20:15,323
From what? From whom?
- From Shakespeare.

208
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:17,748
Sjekkie muscle?
- Ah, diseased muscle...

209
00:20:19,588 --> 00:20:20,963
No?
- No no.

210
00:20:21,965 --> 00:20:24,800
<I> And then you have Fructueux who eats everything </ i>

211
00:20:26,761 --> 00:20:28,671
<I> Even if it lives... </ i>

212
00:20:32,309 --> 00:20:34,348
<i>... even if it is dirty... </ i>

213
00:20:36,021 --> 00:20:39,390
<i>... and even if it already by someone else </ i>
<i> is eaten </ i>

214
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:44,397
<i> And then you have Côme , </ i>
<i> who always wants to be right </ i>

215
00:20:44,571 --> 00:20:47,442
<i> and that is really annoying </ i>
- But four times per day

216
00:20:47,741 --> 00:20:49,567
and every six hours, which is the same.
- No, that's not the same.

217
00:20:49,743 --> 00:20:52,447
That's the same! How So?

218
00:20:52,746 --> 00:20:54,406
I'm not going to say.

219
00:20:56,124 --> 00:20:58,662
<I> Dad is very happy that he is on vacation </ i>

220
00:20:58,835 --> 00:21:01,457
<I> That is to see, </ i>
<i> because he laughs much more often than other </ i. >

221
00:21:06,968 --> 00:21:08,297
Um, <i> Guten Tag... </ i>

222
00:21:09,262 --> 00:21:11,385
Hello.
- If you do not swim?

223
00:21:11,681 --> 00:21:14,219
Yes, but not here.

224
00:21:18,313 --> 00:21:20,638
Sweetheart!
<I> - Mama... </ i>

225
00:21:20,941 --> 00:21:23,348
<i> is exactly as otherwise </ i>
- And.?

226
00:21:23,652 --> 00:21:26,321
<I> Except that she has never had a bathing suit </ i>

227
00:21:27,989 --> 00:21:31,690
But why do you have a bathing suit?
Are you going to swim right now?

228
00:21:31,993 --> 00:21:35,244
Coincidentally, this cap and this swimsuit
a unique set

229
00:21:35,413 --> 00:21:37,620
I bought at the & apos; Young Designers & apos;
Of the New Gallery.

230
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:41,955
If this must be unique then,
because I hope it...

231
00:21:42,128 --> 00:21:45,129
No, but it might be best...
- Yes, of course it can!

232
00:21:45,298 --> 00:21:48,335
& Apos; A unique set, for a unique woman & apos;.

233
00:22:00,856 --> 00:22:03,181
<I> With my friends I play, </ i>
<i> we quarrel, </ i>

234
00:22:03,358 --> 00:22:05,849
<i> We're not talking to each other, </ i>
<i> and it's really cool </ i>

235
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:10,813
Wait for me,
I can not run in the sand!

236
00:22:14,911 --> 00:22:16,109
Kiss.

237
00:22:24,713 --> 00:22:26,504
Wait a minute, boys, this is
if not succeed.

238
00:22:26,923 --> 00:22:29,379
Build your castle,
or any structure whatsoever,

239
00:22:30,594 --> 00:22:32,052
you start with the foundation.

240
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:35,555
I will show you.
It is my profession, I am an architect.

241
00:22:42,606 --> 00:22:43,519
Look at that!

242
00:22:43,815 --> 00:22:47,149
Can we now play with?
- Sure guys, it's there for.

243
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:52,737
But...

244
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,585
Look, this is for Aunt Olga.

245
00:23:09,758 --> 00:23:12,379
Mama?
- Yes, sweetheart?

246
00:23:12,552 --> 00:23:16,336
What & apos; vacuum & apos; in the second person plural
of the pluperfect?

247
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:28,439
The second person plural,
that's you...

248
00:23:29,986 --> 00:23:32,275
So is history...

249
00:23:32,656 --> 00:23:34,814
you stofzuigden,

250
00:23:34,991 --> 00:23:37,945
and the pluperfect
is it...

251
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:40,789
& apos; you have vacuumed & apos ;?

252
00:23:41,081 --> 00:23:43,702
No, & apos; & apos ;. dust sucked

253
00:23:44,793 --> 00:23:45,955
No.

254
00:23:46,127 --> 00:23:48,250
No, & apos; & apos ;? gestofzogen

255
00:23:49,381 --> 00:23:50,875
Stofgezuigd?

256
00:23:52,217 --> 00:23:54,091
Listen Nicholas,
you should come out for yourself!

257
00:23:54,261 --> 00:23:56,752
Your mother is right: if you want to be independent
, you just save you.

258
00:23:57,055 --> 00:23:58,383
Exactly.

259
00:24:06,398 --> 00:24:09,767
Would not it be good if I
a ticket send to Mr. Moucheboume?

260
00:24:10,068 --> 00:24:12,476
Come on, you do not go now
think of your boss, we are on vacation.

261
00:24:12,654 --> 00:24:16,699
Yes, but it is thanks to the good relationship I have with Mr.
Moucheboume

262
00:24:16,866 --> 00:24:21,493
that's possible, that holiday.
- But he did not leave paid out.

263
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:27,704
What do I write? Mr. Moucheboume,
dear Mr. Moucheboume...

264
00:24:28,044 --> 00:24:31,211
Oh no! You're not kidding!
- I just ask for your opinion,

265
00:24:31,381 --> 00:24:33,457
it should not be subject in any case
.

266
00:24:34,259 --> 00:24:37,213
What does that mean, topics?
- That means spineless

267
00:24:37,512 --> 00:24:39,754
and docile, like a slave.

268
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:43,925
You go back to sleep,
I'm fine.

269
00:24:46,354 --> 00:24:49,391
& Apos; Dear sir Moucheboume,
I hope it goes well with you.

270
00:24:49,566 --> 00:24:52,733
We celebrate with you a wonderful holiday.
Greetings family

271
00:24:52,903 --> 00:24:55,773
and thanks.
Sincerely & apos.;

272
00:24:56,948 --> 00:24:58,407
And?

273
00:24:59,034 --> 00:25:00,576
It's good...

274
00:25:01,036 --> 00:25:02,067
Not to topics?

275
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:04,493
It is a design?
- No.

276
00:25:04,789 --> 00:25:08,953
No, topics...
That means... you're doing very obsequious.

277
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:11,293
Ah, okay. Oh...

278
00:25:11,463 --> 00:25:14,036
No, you can not say that it is, huh?

279
00:25:14,341 --> 00:25:18,255
Yes, and still warm, right?
- Hell yeah. Yeah...

280
00:25:18,553 --> 00:25:19,964
Sure...

281
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:53,662
Say, who is that heckler?

282
00:25:53,838 --> 00:25:57,539
It is a film producer,
an Italian.

283
00:25:58,009 --> 00:26:00,547
He's working on a movie.

284
00:26:01,263 --> 00:26:03,220
But anyway, I'd like your opinion.

285
00:26:03,515 --> 00:26:06,220
If you were to send a card to your boss,
how would you begin?

286
00:26:06,393 --> 00:26:09,180
Mr. thingy, dear sir thingy,
or my dear sir thingy?

287
00:26:09,354 --> 00:26:11,810
Chances that do not arrive.
- How Come?

288
00:26:11,982 --> 00:26:14,270
This is not because I'm the boss here.

289
00:26:14,567 --> 00:26:17,189
Yes, but imagine...
- Even if I do that will not arrive.

290
00:26:17,487 --> 00:26:20,773
I understand, but imagine
that you are no longer in charge.

291
00:26:21,074 --> 00:26:23,647
No, I am always the boss.
- But only to help me,

292
00:26:23,827 --> 00:26:25,654
if you were not the boss...
- I understand it very well.

293
00:26:25,829 --> 00:26:27,656
If you were me...
- Are you a boss?

294
00:26:27,956 --> 00:26:30,874
No.
- Then I can not be. I'm a boss.

295
00:26:31,167 --> 00:26:33,575
Yes, but if you assume...
- No, but there is nothing to take.

296
00:26:33,753 --> 00:26:36,541
They will not arrive, that's all.
The boss here, that's me.

297
00:26:38,758 --> 00:26:40,418
But... - No.

298
00:26:41,928 --> 00:26:43,126
No.

299
00:26:54,274 --> 00:26:59,778
<I> Four fünf, sechs, sieben </ i>
<i> Wo ist denn mein Freund geblieben </ i>

300
00:27:00,071 --> 00:27:06,192
<I> Ist niece here ist nicht da </ i>
<i> Ist wohl in America </ i>

301
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:09,407
Bravo!
- What is this?

302
00:27:13,668 --> 00:27:16,338
You could reserve a table.
- Do not worry!

303
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:18,456
That'll be fine.
There is certainly still room.

304
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:23,045
Well, that was... Come on, boy.
<I> Auf Wiedersehen </ i>

305
00:27:25,347 --> 00:27:27,173
Walk me not for the feet!

306
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:31,055
Look, there's still room behind.
Go and ask if we thereby may sit.

307
00:27:31,228 --> 00:27:33,469
Are you sure?
I do not believe that there really is so much space...

308
00:27:33,647 --> 00:27:36,220
You just ask them politely
to slide a bit, that's all.

309
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:39,566
They have no desire to move on...
- Hey, Broekie!

310
00:27:40,779 --> 00:27:43,733
Broekie! Broekie shit!
- Excuse Me Please?

311
00:27:44,074 --> 00:27:46,363
They called us because you like a hare
ran off as soon as there was a fuss!

312
00:27:47,369 --> 00:27:48,911
Do not you know who I am?

313
00:27:49,204 --> 00:27:50,366
Bemique!

314
00:27:50,622 --> 00:27:53,409
Bemique,
of Anatole France school!

315
00:27:53,708 --> 00:27:56,034
Those tadpoles in the café
Mrs. Lantern!

316
00:27:56,336 --> 00:28:00,085
That warps into the spaghetti in the canteen!
And the Office of the math teacher!

317
00:28:00,674 --> 00:28:03,425
We had sawn in half!
- We were suspended for three days!

318
00:28:03,593 --> 00:28:06,131
Bemique!
- Broekie! Come sit with us

319
00:28:06,429 --> 00:28:09,430
we'll push on.
Yes, come!

320
00:28:12,143 --> 00:28:14,551
Is this the first time you come here?
- Yup.

321
00:28:14,854 --> 00:28:17,891
Normally we go... to the mountains.

322
00:28:18,066 --> 00:28:20,474
This was a good choice, here is better.
There is nothing like the sea!

323
00:28:20,652 --> 00:28:23,487
And say what you want, the prices are reasonable.
- Like?

324
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:27,066
Yes! And you can say what you want
but the weather is not worse than elsewhere.

325
00:28:27,242 --> 00:28:30,860
Since we have arrived, it is indeed almost every day was beautiful.

326
00:28:31,162 --> 00:28:34,781
And it will continue! You do not really here
to the Côte d & apos; to desire Azur.

327
00:28:34,958 --> 00:28:38,457
Besides, the Côte d & apos; Azur
is vastly overrated anyway. Do not you?

328
00:28:38,753 --> 00:28:40,912
Just look how sweet they are, those two!

329
00:28:42,048 --> 00:28:45,963
Boy, & apos; t be love at first sight!
- Yes, those two get married fixed!

330
00:28:46,803 --> 00:28:50,172
You see, my dear, one less worry.
He is under the tiles.

331
00:28:53,894 --> 00:28:56,385
Nicholas, you take Isabelle
to your husband?

332
00:28:56,563 --> 00:28:59,729
No! No! No!

333
00:29:00,025 --> 00:29:02,860
You are now the real
linked.

334
00:29:11,911 --> 00:29:14,948
<I> Dear Marie-Edwige, </ i>
<i> our love is in danger </ i>

335
00:29:15,123 --> 00:29:18,041
<I> Mom and dad have decided </ i>
<i> to me forcing to marry </ i>

336
00:29:18,209 --> 00:29:22,207
<i> But do not worry, I will do everything </ i>
<i> to stop that terrible plan </ i>.

337
00:29:28,011 --> 00:29:30,467
That pulls up, you know.
- Sure.

338
00:29:30,639 --> 00:29:33,474
It is but a speck and,
that never lasts very long.

339
00:29:40,232 --> 00:29:43,186
My parents want to force me to marry.
- They can not do at all!

340
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,648
Well. Forced marriages
still exist.

341
00:29:45,946 --> 00:29:49,196
And even if you're big, they're still
your parents who decide who you marry.

342
00:29:49,658 --> 00:29:52,528
You should just be a priest.
Because you are not allowed to marry.

343
00:29:52,702 --> 00:29:54,660
I do not think Marie-Edwige
that's okay.

344
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:00,124
I know what! You must ensure that the parents of the girl
you no longer want.

345
00:30:00,293 --> 00:30:02,998
Because then they cancel the marriage.
- And how do I do that?

346
00:30:03,171 --> 00:30:05,579
For example, I know my sister
courtship had a boy,

347
00:30:05,757 --> 00:30:08,841
and when my parents saw that he drank,
if my sister never see him again.

348
00:30:09,219 --> 00:30:12,802
Yes, parents are always worried that their daughter
going to marry an alcoholic!

349
00:30:13,348 --> 00:30:15,139
I'm not an alcoholic?

350
00:30:19,854 --> 00:30:21,313
These are chocolates with liqueur.

351
00:30:21,982 --> 00:30:24,769
My mother said I was not allowed to come to
because alcohol is in.

352
00:30:24,943 --> 00:30:27,778
If you eat this,
you drunk at dinner.

353
00:30:39,374 --> 00:30:41,283
And what happens?

354
00:30:51,052 --> 00:30:52,333
Oh, baby...

355
00:30:54,306 --> 00:30:56,843
Say, we heard that the little one was sick.

356
00:30:57,017 --> 00:30:59,140
He has abdominal pain.
Fixed gesnoept too.

357
00:30:59,311 --> 00:31:01,718
Snoepertje, how can that be?

358
00:31:01,897 --> 00:31:03,806
My poor honeybun...

359
00:31:04,483 --> 00:31:05,941
Poor darling...

360
00:31:06,234 --> 00:31:08,143
The failed. They are super worried.

361
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,858
She even called him her darling...
- No!

362
00:31:11,031 --> 00:31:12,608
I swear.

363
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:16,821
We have to go, I made reservations for 8 hours.
- We can not leave yet Nicholas.

364
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,454
No, that poor baby.
But Isabelle can stay with him.

365
00:31:21,875 --> 00:31:24,413
However, sweetheart?
- Of Course!

366
00:31:24,711 --> 00:31:27,167
Do not worry, darling,
Isabelle stays with you.

367
00:31:27,339 --> 00:31:30,256
And we come back immediately after eating.
Come on, calm but out.

368
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:52,940
Kiss.

369
00:31:54,157 --> 00:31:55,437
Kiss.

370
00:31:56,493 --> 00:31:57,868
Kiss?

371
00:31:58,078 --> 00:31:59,240
Kiss?

372
00:32:22,269 --> 00:32:26,101
I'll explain. It's like this:
the parents of the girl always look

373
00:32:26,273 --> 00:32:28,182
or the parents of the boy have money.

374
00:32:28,483 --> 00:32:31,650
If the parents of the boy really have a lot of money
, you want the girl's parents

375
00:32:31,945 --> 00:32:34,068
anxious that their daughter marry this guy.

376
00:32:34,239 --> 00:32:37,904
But if the parents of the boy
not have much money, then yes

377
00:32:38,201 --> 00:32:40,775
prohibit the girl's parents
her to see the boy

378
00:32:40,954 --> 00:32:44,489
and they say he is badly brought up, but that
it is not, it is because he is poor.

379
00:32:45,041 --> 00:32:48,042
What? Should you crying so?
- No, the sun is shining in my eyes!

380
00:32:49,337 --> 00:32:53,086
So, what should I do?
- Let them believe that you are poor.

381
00:33:17,532 --> 00:33:20,319
Okay, Nicholas?
- Yes...

382
00:33:20,535 --> 00:33:23,453
Since it appears not. What is up?
Do not have a nice holiday?

383
00:33:23,622 --> 00:33:27,204
Yes, but & apos; t be sorry
that it is the last...

384
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:31,119
The last? Why the last?
- The problems of dad.

385
00:33:31,296 --> 00:33:33,502
He says that after this holiday
can not.

386
00:33:34,174 --> 00:33:36,879
Does he have problems, your dad?
- Yes, since he was fired from his job

387
00:33:37,177 --> 00:33:39,086
because his boss, Mr. Moucheboume
,

388
00:33:39,262 --> 00:33:42,880
who left with all the money.
- He left with the cash?

389
00:33:43,183 --> 00:33:45,425
Yes, and even with his secretary.
- Yup?

390
00:33:45,602 --> 00:33:48,686
Yes, but Dad said it was not very
because we had money put aside

391
00:33:48,855 --> 00:33:51,346
that we could use it until he had a new job again.

392
00:33:51,524 --> 00:33:54,609
So I asked what they
that money we put aside.

393
00:33:54,778 --> 00:33:56,901
Dad laughed, but not mom.
- How Come?

394
00:33:57,072 --> 00:33:59,907
Because Omi had gone to the casino with
aside money

395
00:34:00,075 --> 00:34:01,783
And when dad was completely white.

396
00:34:02,744 --> 00:34:06,409
Wow.
- And since come almost every week

397
00:34:06,706 --> 00:34:09,791
men in gray suits knocking at our home.

398
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:13,163
We can not move,
then it seems we are not there.

399
00:34:14,089 --> 00:34:17,588
But... what does your dad than
to get food?

400
00:34:17,884 --> 00:34:21,170
Well, sometimes he steals.
- He Steals?

401
00:34:21,471 --> 00:34:25,303
He must. Sometimes my mom says
nothing to eat,

402
00:34:25,475 --> 00:34:29,140
so then my dad goes to the supermarket
and then he steals food.

403
00:34:31,439 --> 00:34:34,191
And sometimes we go to bed without supper.

404
00:34:35,068 --> 00:34:38,520
And I dream & apos;
night I eat a plum cake.

405
00:34:38,697 --> 00:34:42,397
That was my favorite tail,
at the time we were not poor.

406
00:35:02,137 --> 00:35:05,672
Please. Bon Appetit.
<I> - Thank you </ i>

407
00:35:08,059 --> 00:35:10,597
Please, enjoy!.

408
00:35:11,688 --> 00:35:14,974
Good evening. We share the table?

409
00:35:15,275 --> 00:35:16,853
Um, actually...
- We have already begun.

410
00:35:17,319 --> 00:35:20,438
Does not matter. Enjoy it.
- You too.

411
00:35:20,697 --> 00:35:23,366
Look, there is still room behind.
- Sorry, I can not.

412
00:35:23,658 --> 00:35:26,659
Broekie! Come in anyway.
We'll get out.

413
00:35:26,953 --> 00:35:29,871
Come, come.
If yes.

414
00:35:30,165 --> 00:35:32,454
What you take?
Lobster or crab?

415
00:35:32,751 --> 00:35:35,289
Go ahead, I invite you.
- I still do not.

416
00:35:35,462 --> 00:35:37,869
Yes, why?
- Because I think that's fine!

417
00:35:39,174 --> 00:35:43,218
And we want our children to have a good
vacation without worry.

418
00:35:43,386 --> 00:35:45,130
Come on, for better times!

419
00:35:46,097 --> 00:35:48,386
Okay, cheers.

420
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:52,561
What do you say, Nicholas?
- This does not smell good.

421
00:35:55,398 --> 00:35:58,768
What a beautiful ring...
- Yes, a family heirloom,

422
00:35:59,069 --> 00:36:01,192
I've had it for years.

423
00:36:01,488 --> 00:36:04,405
And you would not want to sell him?
- Never in my life!

424
00:36:05,992 --> 00:36:07,902
And that adorns you, though!

425
00:36:08,078 --> 00:36:11,613
You do not lose your self-respect because
rotbazen who have no conscience!

426
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:14,910
That's pretty hard... You know, the
are people too, just like all the others.

427
00:36:15,627 --> 00:36:18,996
They have their weaknesses, but also their qualities. Even So?

428
00:36:19,297 --> 00:36:22,631
Exactly, but still...
- In any case, you always defend him.

429
00:36:22,884 --> 00:36:26,004
Yes, well! You accept everything from him.
I really need to say

430
00:36:26,304 --> 00:36:29,222
that Mr. Moucheboume,
the boss of my husband...

431
00:36:29,391 --> 00:36:31,929
No, we do not know.
- Indeed, they do not know.

432
00:36:32,227 --> 00:36:33,686
They do not know...

433
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:39,099
I have to admit that I admire
for your courage and your integrity.

434
00:36:39,526 --> 00:36:42,942
Thank you, but...
Yes! And I'll say something.

435
00:36:43,113 --> 00:36:46,647
When we were in school,
you were not my best friend...

436
00:36:46,825 --> 00:36:50,028
I know.
- If you & apos; t ask me today, you're it.

437
00:36:51,705 --> 00:36:54,457
Similarly .
- And you and I, we stay together.

438
00:37:02,007 --> 00:37:03,999
Shall we finish the evening in the casino?
- No!

439
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:07,752
I mean, we have a lovely evening

440
00:37:07,929 --> 00:37:09,507
and let's enjoy the moment.

441
00:37:09,681 --> 00:37:12,219
Meals.
- Thank u.

442
00:37:18,273 --> 00:37:20,016
I love to do!

443
00:37:20,442 --> 00:37:22,435
It is very much.

444
00:37:23,278 --> 00:37:24,309
I do it gladly.

445
00:37:35,081 --> 00:37:37,999
Better weather than yesterday, huh?
<I> - Sorry, we don & apos; t speak French </ i>

446
00:37:38,376 --> 00:37:41,496
Ah, no French...
Excuse me..

447
00:37:46,134 --> 00:37:49,218
Are you from this area?
<I> - Verzeihung, ich kein spreche Französisch </ i>

448
00:37:49,387 --> 00:37:51,510
I said, <i> you are from the </ i> area.?

449
00:37:53,683 --> 00:37:57,017
Now I talk in English while...
Well, never mind, never mind.

450
00:37:57,562 --> 00:38:00,848
What do you want?
- There are still here real Parisians.

451
00:38:01,024 --> 00:38:03,645
I come from Normandy. What would you like to order?
- Very nice, Normandy.

452
00:38:03,819 --> 00:38:07,863
I will say that I am not a Parisian
. I come from the Franche-Comté.

453
00:38:08,031 --> 00:38:11,566
My mother, who was...
- You can still think for.

454
00:38:19,459 --> 00:38:23,409
Hello.
- You go fix swim in your secret place.

455
00:38:23,588 --> 00:38:25,795
Yes. Would you like to participate?

456
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:29,374
Yes.

457
00:38:38,895 --> 00:38:41,433
I understand. It is magnificent.

458
00:38:41,856 --> 00:38:44,145
And it is especially very quiet.

459
00:38:44,317 --> 00:38:47,982
But you must remain silent, this is my secret.
- I swear word.

460
00:38:49,197 --> 00:38:52,697
Do you naturalism?
- Eh, naturalism...?

461
00:38:53,201 --> 00:38:55,988
Yes. I love the nature,

462
00:38:56,162 --> 00:38:59,163
everything, the trees, the...
- That & apos; s beautiful. I do too.

463
00:39:03,169 --> 00:39:06,040
Ah, I understand, naturalism...

464
00:39:10,677 --> 00:39:14,627
Will you?
Come on! You're not scared or something?

465
00:39:14,931 --> 00:39:18,300
Am I afraid?
No, certainly not. Well no.

466
00:39:19,352 --> 00:39:21,677
I'm coming.
- I'll see you at the rocks.

467
00:39:28,737 --> 00:39:32,022
Come on over, the water's lovely!

468
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,749
Look who's here.

469
00:39:48,798 --> 00:39:50,542
Beautiful day.
- Aye!

470
00:39:50,717 --> 00:39:53,291
It will not take long, but well...
- Would you mind?

471
00:39:53,595 --> 00:39:55,303
Wait, I'll help you.

472
00:40:03,855 --> 00:40:06,477
It's good, thank you.
- You're welcome.

473
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:08,856
We wish you a good day.
- You too.

474
00:40:09,152 --> 00:40:11,228
Greetings to your wife.
- I will definitely do.

475
00:40:44,521 --> 00:40:46,015
Kiss.

476
00:40:52,404 --> 00:40:55,440
There is a solution: make them go away.
- That they leave?

477
00:40:55,615 --> 00:40:58,071
Yes, because they see your parents no longer
and forget marriage.

478
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:02,408
We need to find something they are afraid of,
because they go there like a hare.

479
00:41:02,706 --> 00:41:04,116
I know what.
- No, I know what!

480
00:41:04,291 --> 00:41:06,864
What do you know?
- I do not know, but what did you say?

481
00:41:07,168 --> 00:41:09,956
We put a snake in their bed.
- A snake?

482
00:41:11,923 --> 00:41:14,331
What are these snakes?
- Those are vipers.

483
00:41:14,634 --> 00:41:18,714
Vipers?
- If they are here, the mother is not far.

484
00:41:19,014 --> 00:41:20,674
And you what?

485
00:41:20,849 --> 00:41:22,758
How to catch a viper?
- You see what?

486
00:41:23,059 --> 00:41:25,218
Is there a snake?

487
00:41:25,979 --> 00:41:29,679
What... What do you see then?
Say something!

488
00:41:29,858 --> 00:41:33,642
I'm certainly not afraid, but you might well have come up with something better than
catch a viper.

489
00:41:33,945 --> 00:41:35,274
Have an already caught?

490
00:41:35,447 --> 00:41:39,147
Hey, guys,
there is a snake here until...

491
00:41:39,451 --> 00:41:44,362
Are they friendly, vipers?
- After a bite, you are within 5 minutes dead.

492
00:41:48,543 --> 00:41:51,034
The snake! Turn around, guys!

493
00:42:15,612 --> 00:42:17,937
What should we do now?

494
00:42:18,114 --> 00:42:21,364
Eggs! Which are still there.
We hide them in the room of Bemique

495
00:42:21,534 --> 00:42:25,200
and when they come, packed with snakes!
- Yes, good idea.

496
00:42:29,084 --> 00:42:30,080
Oh, no...

497
00:42:39,177 --> 00:42:41,384
& apos; It's strange, he did not reply.
- Who?

498
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,380
Mr. Moucheboume.
And I clearly had this address put on it.

499
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:50,179
Maybe mislaid.

500
00:42:50,438 --> 00:42:52,894
Or worse, has as & apos; s office
pummel him just

501
00:42:53,066 --> 00:42:56,020
done in the trash,
that happens often...

502
00:42:57,237 --> 00:43:00,820
If I send another one there now...
- Is it done talking about that card?

503
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:03,316
Really, this is just too childish!
- Childish?

504
00:43:03,618 --> 00:43:06,453
I do not understand what is childish to that.
- You're right, it's not childish.

505
00:43:07,038 --> 00:43:07,952
Thank you.

506
00:43:08,248 --> 00:43:10,288
It's subservience.

507
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:38,224
Slowly from the helicopter. <I> Pronti </ i>

508
00:43:38,403 --> 00:43:40,859
Yes, slowly... Come, come.

509
00:43:41,031 --> 00:43:44,945
Slow... Brilliant!
Come, come, come...

510
00:43:45,243 --> 00:43:48,197
<i> Sei bella sei superba... </ i> So!

511
00:43:48,497 --> 00:43:50,869
With the lips forward. Very good!

512
00:43:51,166 --> 00:43:53,372
<I> Sei fantastica, sei sublimation </ i>

513
00:43:53,752 --> 00:43:56,587
<i> Sei superba... Via! Sei sublimation... Via </ i>

514
00:43:57,339 --> 00:44:00,008
<i> Dio quanto amo questa donna </ i>

515
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:03,585
Is she pretty? I can not hear you!

516
00:44:03,887 --> 00:44:07,053
Is she beautiful ?!
- Yeah, sure, she is very beautiful!

517
00:44:07,349 --> 00:44:08,973
<I> Bellissima bellissima </ i>

518
00:44:09,935 --> 00:44:12,093
You are my actress,
you're my star!

519
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:16,137
Yes, the champagne, let it flow, let it flow...

520
00:44:16,441 --> 00:44:19,276
& apos; Dear sir Moucheboume...

521
00:44:19,986 --> 00:44:22,312
I hope it goes well with you.

522
00:44:22,489 --> 00:44:26,356
We celebrate with you a wonderful holiday.

523
00:44:27,536 --> 00:44:31,782
Greetings family
and thank you.

524
00:44:32,624 --> 00:44:34,747
Yours & apos;.

525
00:44:38,296 --> 00:44:39,327
What a wretch...

526
00:44:47,472 --> 00:44:49,132
<i> & apos; Mr. Moucheboume, </ i>

527
00:44:49,683 --> 00:44:54,843
<i> Because of the indifference and contempt </ i>
<i> you compared me has shown, </ i>

528
00:44:55,021 --> 00:44:57,975
<i> despite all these years </ i>
<i> loyal service from my side, </ i>

529
00:44:58,149 --> 00:45:01,815
<i> I see no other way out, </ i >

530
00:45:01,987 --> 00:45:04,822
<I> immediately and not negotiable </ i>

531
00:45:07,492 --> 00:45:10,410
<I> And while I'm working, you should know </ i>
<i> I've always hated </ i>

532
00:45:10,579 --> 00:45:12,287
<i> that hysterical hyena laugh of you & apos;. </ i>

533
00:45:18,628 --> 00:45:21,119
Boss! A whiskey!

534
00:45:21,464 --> 00:45:23,042
I have no whiskey.

535
00:45:25,927 --> 00:45:27,552
Then, a glass of cider...

536
00:45:27,846 --> 00:45:29,221
Yes, that's very good.

537
00:45:35,645 --> 00:45:36,890
Sure.

538
00:45:37,814 --> 00:45:40,601
Look at, since he's like,
I will give him.

539
00:45:41,234 --> 00:45:42,397
Mr. Moucheboume.

540
00:45:46,448 --> 00:45:49,117
Hello?
<I> - My good man, so good </ i>

541
00:45:50,202 --> 00:45:52,028
Yes, thank you?.
- Fine, very fine.

542
00:45:52,204 --> 00:45:54,777
I wanted to thank you for your postcard.

543
00:45:55,081 --> 00:45:57,572
<I> That does me good </ i>
<i> Yes, that really touches me </ i>

544
00:45:57,876 --> 00:46:00,165
Not everyone is so thoughtful.

545
00:46:00,337 --> 00:46:03,540
So yes, I want to say.
- But it was not necessary...

546
00:46:03,715 --> 00:46:06,004
Yes! It's very important!

547
00:46:06,176 --> 00:46:09,924
Because we all work hard and you'll
not always have time for this kind of thing, right?

548
00:46:10,221 --> 00:46:13,756
Besides, equip nice because I have
big plans for you when you return.

549
00:46:13,934 --> 00:46:16,175
Do you have plans?
<I> - Yes. Big plans </ i>

550
00:46:16,478 --> 00:46:18,221
<I> But they will </ i>
<i> when you get back, okay </ i>

551
00:46:18,521 --> 00:46:22,471
For now, enjoy it!
Happy holiday!

552
00:46:22,776 --> 00:46:24,733
Thank you, sir Moucheboume.

553
00:46:24,903 --> 00:46:26,942
Goodbye, Mr. Moucheboume.

554
00:47:30,802 --> 00:47:33,589
Look there! Look there!

555
00:47:50,447 --> 00:47:53,614
Mr. Bemique? Mrs. Bemique?

556
00:48:01,541 --> 00:48:03,119
The door!

557
00:48:06,004 --> 00:48:08,625
But first you must swear
that if something goes wrong,

558
00:48:08,798 --> 00:48:11,468
you never tell my parents
it was my idea.

559
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,048
I swear word.

560
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:18,171
Look good,
this is the direction of the shower.

561
00:48:18,350 --> 00:48:22,182
And that is the direction of the water
to the sewer. Crépin, come here.

562
00:48:31,947 --> 00:48:35,315
If we connect two pipes
together, they will be surprised

563
00:48:35,492 --> 00:48:37,947
if the next time they take
shower.

564
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:43,037
Come on, get to work.
- I'm on hold.

565
00:48:43,208 --> 00:48:44,287
Thank you.

566
00:49:55,739 --> 00:49:56,521
Here.

567
00:49:56,948 --> 00:49:58,229
You should & apos; m lost.

568
00:50:00,327 --> 00:50:03,826
Bracelet Marie-Edwige.
That I searched for a few days.

569
00:50:04,039 --> 00:50:04,988
Thanks.

570
00:50:09,085 --> 00:50:11,327
But... why do not you say something?

571
00:50:11,504 --> 00:50:12,750
Because...

572
00:50:13,715 --> 00:50:15,339
I'm shy.

573
00:50:22,432 --> 00:50:24,508
<I> Actually, Isabelle is a crazy girl </ i>

574
00:50:24,684 --> 00:50:28,267
<i> The rest of the afternoon we went together </ i>
<i> and it was really enjoyable </ i>.

575
00:51:01,096 --> 00:51:02,839
Hey, look!

576
00:51:04,724 --> 00:51:08,259
<I> The boys were in the beginning </ i>
<i> not so happy... </ i>

577
00:51:15,568 --> 00:51:18,570
What is she doing here?
- Why did you take her?

578
00:51:18,738 --> 00:51:22,866
We do not play with girls.
- When it comes, we do not talk to her.

579
00:51:31,710 --> 00:51:34,248
<I> But they changed quickly feel </ i>

580
00:51:37,215 --> 00:51:41,047
<I> And then they all wanted her </ i>
<i> show what they could </ i>

581
00:51:41,344 --> 00:51:43,302
Hey, Isabelle, look!

582
00:51:45,181 --> 00:51:47,968
Isabelle, look! <I> Look </ i>

583
00:51:51,896 --> 00:51:53,640
Hey, Isabelle, look!

584
00:51:57,277 --> 00:51:58,901
Hey, look, look!

585
00:52:02,991 --> 00:52:04,734
Isabelle, look!

586
00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:07,827
It does not even hurt!

587
00:52:12,542 --> 00:52:15,994
Okay, see you tomorrow.
- Yes, tomorrow.

588
00:52:18,214 --> 00:52:20,254
She is lucky, Marie-Edwige...

589
00:52:28,517 --> 00:52:30,390
Nicholas, you take Isabelle
to your husband?

590
00:52:32,979 --> 00:52:34,354
Yes!

591
00:52:39,486 --> 00:52:40,351
The shower!

592
00:53:14,145 --> 00:53:18,060
This is the first time something like this happens.
I swear, it's the first time.

593
00:53:18,233 --> 00:53:21,436
I do & apos; t not, I check everything.
- The bill!

594
00:53:21,736 --> 00:53:23,694
I have not counted the scrambled eggs.

595
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,592
Damn, do not believe it!

596
00:53:46,177 --> 00:53:49,760
What is that, as & apos; s thing?
- This is the distributor.

597
00:53:51,057 --> 00:53:54,557
The mechanic was called. It's a friend.
He will make him quickly.

598
00:53:54,728 --> 00:53:58,179
The sheets are changed.
- And we have repaired the pipes.

599
00:54:00,233 --> 00:54:01,562
See?

600
00:54:02,944 --> 00:54:05,566
Everything is cleaned from top to below
.

601
00:54:14,247 --> 00:54:16,489
No, no, no!
But stop, stop it!

602
00:54:16,958 --> 00:54:19,366
No, no, no, no!

603
00:54:21,546 --> 00:54:23,503
No! <I> Non è possibile </ i>

604
00:54:24,216 --> 00:54:26,671
This is incredible. I've been three times
read the same sentence.

605
00:54:26,968 --> 00:54:29,257
Would you briefly at the man say he
is not alone on this beach?

606
00:54:29,554 --> 00:54:31,345
I?
- Yes you.

607
00:54:31,639 --> 00:54:33,467
That makes no sense.
They must have a permit.

608
00:54:33,767 --> 00:54:35,724
A license which,
ruin our vacation?

609
00:54:36,019 --> 00:54:39,470
It will not really last long.
In movies they never work very long.

610
00:54:39,773 --> 00:54:42,727
Silence please, please!
Baby,

611
00:54:43,735 --> 00:54:46,308
I love you, you know that, right?

612
00:54:46,488 --> 00:54:49,939
But what did I say?
Did I tell military?

613
00:54:50,241 --> 00:54:54,073
No! Exactly! I said more mysterious,

614
00:54:54,246 --> 00:54:58,030
more sensual, more wa-ter-like...

615
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:01,658
If we do it again? Are you ready?

616
00:55:04,547 --> 00:55:06,955
Camera!

617
00:55:08,134 --> 00:55:09,379
Action!

618
00:55:11,763 --> 00:55:13,590
No! No, stop it!

619
00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:16,049
Stop it!
Who pulls me now something ?!

620
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:21,013
Okay, that's enough.

621
00:55:21,773 --> 00:55:23,849
But darling...

622
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:26,558
I said mermaid, not jellyfish!

623
00:55:26,987 --> 00:55:28,529
Again.

624
00:55:28,822 --> 00:55:31,906
Sorry to interrupt
middle of this... whatever it is...

625
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:34,738
Head in & apos; t water.
... But you make quite a lot of noise.

626
00:55:35,036 --> 00:55:36,828
Camera!

627
00:55:37,872 --> 00:55:39,616
Hello, I'm talking to you!

628
00:55:41,042 --> 00:55:45,254
I do not know who you are, sir, but this is not Cinecittà
! This is Mers-les-Bains!

629
00:55:45,463 --> 00:55:48,832
Stop yelling like a polecat
because the people here are on vacation.

630
00:55:49,509 --> 00:55:50,790
Is & apos; t clear?

631
00:56:16,703 --> 00:56:19,075
You see, it is not so difficult.

632
00:56:31,801 --> 00:56:34,471
Excuse me,
I am the personal assistant

633
00:56:34,637 --> 00:56:38,766
Mr. Massimo Massini,
the famous producer with whom you...

634
00:56:39,976 --> 00:56:43,013
had a short meeting,
and Mr. Massini

635
00:56:43,313 --> 00:56:47,013
apologizes to. He was not aware of the noise

636
00:56:47,192 --> 00:56:51,355
he caused.
He lets say it him very sorry.

637
00:56:51,822 --> 00:56:54,739
Five minutes longer, then I was gone.
And I can tell you that...

638
00:56:57,702 --> 00:57:00,573
To apologize, Mr. Massini
want to invite you

639
00:57:00,747 --> 00:57:04,116
at the party that he organized tonight
in the Mocambo club.

640
00:57:04,292 --> 00:57:06,415
He would like to see them anxious.

641
00:57:06,961 --> 00:57:09,038
What is he thinking!
- Why not, come on.

642
00:57:09,214 --> 00:57:12,547
Maybe it's what? Just tell
Mr. Dinges we will think about it.

643
00:57:13,427 --> 00:57:17,376
What? We have not been out once
in this holiday. Now you do.

644
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,846
And that little black dress of the funeral
Aunt Simone

645
00:57:21,017 --> 00:57:22,761
that was good for you. Did you join?

646
00:57:23,061 --> 00:57:25,350
Uncle Albert was getting compliments.
- Say Yes, he had lost the plot,

647
00:57:25,522 --> 00:57:28,309
he held me for the young aunt Simone.
- Does not matter, & apos; t got you beautiful.

648
00:57:28,483 --> 00:57:30,392
Yes, a funeral dress
for an evening at the Mocambo,

649
00:57:30,569 --> 00:57:31,683
that is not particularly suitable either ?!

650
00:57:31,862 --> 00:57:34,946
Have him or not?
- Yes, I have it with me.

651
00:57:42,873 --> 00:57:45,624
Dad?
How did mommy and you meet?

652
00:57:45,917 --> 00:57:48,040
Have I ever told you?
- No.

653
00:57:48,253 --> 00:57:51,004
It was during a ball.
- A ball?

654
00:57:51,339 --> 00:57:52,833
No one dared to ask your mother.

655
00:57:53,008 --> 00:57:56,626
She was so beautiful and that shocked everyone
off and then I collected all my courage

656
00:57:56,803 --> 00:57:58,428
and went to her.
- And have you danced?

657
00:57:58,596 --> 00:58:00,589
Oh yeah, all night.

658
00:58:00,932 --> 00:58:03,637
So long that they had to throw
us out to make us stop.

659
00:58:05,103 --> 00:58:08,104
And you go dancing tonight?
- Yeah, sure!

660
00:58:10,275 --> 00:58:12,102
Look how beautiful is your mother.

661
00:58:13,028 --> 00:58:14,902
Well, shall we go?

662
00:58:16,573 --> 00:58:20,986
Can I watch TV tonight?
- No TV. Nine hours to bed, as always.

663
00:58:30,128 --> 00:58:31,622
Not too long, huh. Kiss?

664
00:58:47,687 --> 00:58:51,222
<I> I have the whole evening to dad </ i>
<i> and mom thought </ i>

665
00:58:51,650 --> 00:58:54,437
<I> I told myself that they were lucky </ i>
<i > they are so in love </ i>

666
00:58:54,611 --> 00:58:56,900
<i> and they establish a good night </ i>
<i> would </ i>

667
00:59:22,806 --> 00:59:25,178
I feel this is going to be nothing.
Shall we not go back?

668
00:59:25,350 --> 00:59:28,635
Relax anyway, we would have
good night and we'll have that too!

669
00:59:29,437 --> 00:59:31,893
Will you dance, baby?
- Hold on, do not be silly.

670
00:59:32,065 --> 00:59:34,307
I get a glass for you,
then you feel more secure.

671
00:59:34,484 --> 00:59:36,358
Wait here, I'll be.

672
00:59:38,905 --> 00:59:43,318
Ma'am! You're there. Massimo
absolutely want to see you, but you will come along.

673
00:59:52,669 --> 00:59:54,329
<I> Maestro </ i>
<i> - s </ i>

674
00:59:55,672 --> 00:59:57,499
Madam.!

675
00:59:59,968 --> 01:00:02,340
Thank you. My husband is just as...
- I insist!

676
01:00:02,512 --> 01:00:03,923
Champagne for the woman who is more expressive
,

677
01:00:04,222 --> 01:00:06,594
more articulate,
and convincing than I have ever met!

678
01:00:06,891 --> 01:00:09,845
That seems a bit exaggerated, huh.
- No, I never exaggerate.

679
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:11,597
Life itself overreacting.

680
01:00:13,398 --> 01:00:14,643
Drink anyway!

681
01:00:15,525 --> 01:00:18,395
But I must always be careful with alcohol...
- Drink anyway!

682
01:00:33,877 --> 01:00:36,546
What does a glass of champagne?
- It costs nothing, sir.

683
01:00:36,713 --> 01:00:39,251
& Apos; s a private party of Mr. Massini.
- Ah, very good.

684
01:00:39,424 --> 01:00:41,381
Then two glasses of champagne happy.

685
01:00:43,344 --> 01:00:44,590
Thank you.

686
01:00:45,347 --> 01:00:46,426
Excuse me, excuse me.

687
01:00:46,723 --> 01:00:49,594
Her hair is magnificent:
a lot of relief and contrast.

688
01:00:49,893 --> 01:00:53,262
It works beautifully on screen.
- Keep agree with that fiddling!

689
01:00:53,438 --> 01:00:55,431
She is certainly not a commodity, ¶?

690
01:00:55,732 --> 01:00:57,938
No, indeed, not really.
- Sit down, ma'am.

691
01:01:09,121 --> 01:01:12,157
When I saw you at the beach today,
was truly a revelation.

692
01:01:12,332 --> 01:01:16,875
I said to myself: <i> donna che </ i>
This is a woman! I need her!

693
01:01:17,170 --> 01:01:19,079
Why, her will I need?

694
01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:22,377
Yes, for my film! <I> Quale altra cosa </ i>

695
01:01:22,676 --> 01:01:26,839
Yes, what other <i> cosa </ i>
What other <i> cosa, </ i> eh no?.

696
01:01:27,013 --> 01:01:28,472
For & apos; & apos ;, my film which film?

697
01:01:29,224 --> 01:01:31,133
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.

698
01:01:33,019 --> 01:01:34,098
This is private, sir.

699
01:01:34,270 --> 01:01:36,228
Yeah, but I have
at my wife there.

700
01:01:36,398 --> 01:01:37,477
It's private.

701
01:01:37,649 --> 01:01:39,227
Yes, but my wife is.
Sweetheart!

702
01:01:39,526 --> 01:01:43,227
It is a beautiful story,
<i> quella di una donna... molto forte, </ i>

703
01:01:43,530 --> 01:01:46,151
<i> molto bella, molto molto innamorata... </ i>

704
01:01:46,658 --> 01:01:49,410
Cause eh, I will explain, we are
er...

705
01:01:57,460 --> 01:02:00,545
<i> Non sono </ i> actress. <I> No. No </ i> actress.

706
01:02:00,714 --> 01:02:04,414
That's not important!
Absolutely not, <i> niente </ i>

707
01:02:04,593 --> 01:02:07,712
What counts is the temperament, character...

708
01:02:08,013 --> 01:02:10,089
But why <i> niente, </ i>
not <i> niente. </ i>

709
01:02:10,265 --> 01:02:12,720
I've done a little theater
when I was young at the lyceum,

710
01:02:12,893 --> 01:02:14,173
but if you compare that...

711
01:02:14,478 --> 01:02:17,182
Do you think I'm an amateur?
A sucker? A <i> piece of shit </ i>

712
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:20,232
No, not at all.
- I produced fifteen movies!

713
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:23,686
In Rome they call me on the street after
<i> Maestro, Maestro </ i>

714
01:02:23,862 --> 01:02:26,151
American actresses from Hollywood by plane

715
01:02:26,322 --> 01:02:28,114
to audition with me!

716
01:02:28,408 --> 01:02:31,444
I? I do not even get!

717
01:02:31,745 --> 01:02:33,536
This lasts for a year, you hear it?

718
01:02:33,705 --> 01:02:35,496
One year I've been looking
to the heroine of my film.

719
01:02:35,790 --> 01:02:38,032
And today I found her:
that is you.

720
01:02:38,209 --> 01:02:39,870
Volcano wife, the wife Storm,

721
01:02:40,045 --> 01:02:43,378
the mother, the sister, the beloved,
all in one body!

722
01:02:47,344 --> 01:02:49,135
Dance with me!

723
01:03:47,654 --> 01:03:49,196
That's my wife.

724
01:04:08,967 --> 01:04:12,051
Come on, that's my wife!
- Okay, that's enough!

725
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:13,216
Sweetheart!

726
01:05:01,853 --> 01:05:03,929
Why is not Mommy there?

727
01:05:04,606 --> 01:05:07,358
She wanted to stay.
- Why So?

728
01:05:07,859 --> 01:05:09,982
She liked it.
- Do not you?

729
01:05:10,153 --> 01:05:11,896
No, I do not.

730
01:05:14,074 --> 01:05:17,822
But she comes back when she has had enough?

731
01:05:20,330 --> 01:05:23,829
You know, Nicholas, with mom and dad,
occasionally...

732
01:05:26,461 --> 01:05:29,628
No, because in the beginning...
fine...

733
01:05:30,006 --> 01:05:31,963
or that you believe...

734
01:05:32,592 --> 01:05:34,086
you imagine that...

735
01:05:34,552 --> 01:05:37,672
but it's not as simple as
life so you want different things

736
01:05:37,847 --> 01:05:40,219
and not necessarily at the same time so...

737
01:05:40,934 --> 01:05:43,686
Yes, so try to fit you,

738
01:05:43,854 --> 01:05:45,811
your compromises...

739
01:05:56,866 --> 01:05:58,064
Mrs. ,

740
01:05:58,702 --> 01:06:01,193
promise me to think about my proposal
.

741
01:06:01,371 --> 01:06:04,289
You can be a star,
a big star!

742
01:06:04,458 --> 01:06:06,830
I promise. I'll think about it.

743
01:06:16,219 --> 01:06:18,924
That's enough! Naughty rascal!

744
01:06:27,022 --> 01:06:30,272
Give me some time,
I have to think about.

745
01:07:27,791 --> 01:07:29,783
We scrambled eggs
excluded.

746
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:32,914
And the cake either. Hey, baby?

747
01:07:33,088 --> 01:07:36,124
And if you want to come back again,
then you get the blue room

748
01:07:36,299 --> 01:07:39,502
which has sea views.
- So it's true? You leave?

749
01:07:40,762 --> 01:07:42,636
What a pity!
- Yes & apos; t be sorry.

750
01:07:42,806 --> 01:07:45,213
Once a stubborn, always a stubborn, eh?
Come here, man, I liked it.

751
01:07:45,767 --> 01:07:47,890
Yeah, me too.
And I hope it will be okay, right?

752
01:07:48,186 --> 01:07:50,428
With what?
- Yes uh...

753
01:07:55,902 --> 01:07:59,022
weather!
- Well yes, it pulls up.

754
01:07:59,197 --> 01:08:02,114
Hey, that it attracts?
- Yes, it does go up, it does not take long.

755
01:08:02,284 --> 01:08:05,450
There is plenty of cases, the beautiful weather
is coming, that is coming back.

756
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:07,743
It's really unfortunate that you're leaving, but yes.

757
01:08:07,914 --> 01:08:10,535
Especially now that the good weather is coming.

758
01:08:10,917 --> 01:08:13,954
It's crazy, but I find no
portfolio or checks.

759
01:08:15,714 --> 01:08:16,828
Oh no?

760
01:08:17,257 --> 01:08:18,585
No.

761
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:25,222
Oh no.

762
01:08:27,684 --> 01:08:30,222
What annoying, say.
- Yes, this is very annoying.

763
01:08:44,576 --> 01:08:45,525
Stand up.

764
01:09:28,829 --> 01:09:32,826
It seems that we still
a few days stay longer.

765
01:09:33,125 --> 01:09:35,248
I have to call the bank to ask for new
checks.

766
01:09:35,543 --> 01:09:36,457
Prima.

767
01:09:38,004 --> 01:09:39,712
I Put it on the bill?

768
01:09:40,924 --> 01:09:42,204
With good bills, good friends.

769
01:09:48,098 --> 01:09:50,589
You know, when I grow up I'm
captain on a ship

770
01:09:50,767 --> 01:09:52,178
and I earn a lot of money.

771
01:09:52,477 --> 01:09:54,102
And then we go to a lot of wonderful places
,

772
01:09:54,270 --> 01:09:56,228
like Tahiti or Le Havre.

773
01:09:57,232 --> 01:09:58,560
At least...

774
01:09:59,192 --> 01:10:00,983
if you want.

775
01:10:51,661 --> 01:10:52,824
Okay?

776
01:10:52,996 --> 01:10:54,870
You know, I'm a little thirsty.

777
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:56,913
Perhaps you want to get a cocktail for me at the bar?

778
01:10:57,917 --> 01:10:59,328
A fruit cocktail.

779
01:10:59,502 --> 01:11:01,709
With pineapple and coconut.

780
01:11:03,214 --> 01:11:05,503
What are you waiting for? Sweetheart?

781
01:11:13,850 --> 01:11:16,139
How is it for you to be a star?

782
01:11:16,311 --> 01:11:19,762
I believe you paid a lot attention to
something only a rumor.

783
01:11:20,064 --> 01:11:23,065
Excuse me, excuse me.
- He has yet offered a role...

784
01:11:23,234 --> 01:11:24,777
Sorry...
- but maybe,

785
01:11:24,945 --> 01:11:27,732
I do not know how to say it,
it all went so fast.

786
01:11:27,906 --> 01:11:29,945
I realize not completely
all what happens to me.

787
01:11:30,742 --> 01:11:32,900
Here, darling, your cocktail.

788
01:11:33,078 --> 01:11:36,411
Thank you, honey, that's sweet
but I'm in an interview!

789
01:11:37,749 --> 01:11:41,960
It is certainly true that you carry with you
things that you ignore, and suddenly,

790
01:11:42,128 --> 01:11:46,375
one day, then someone, or actually a man

791
01:11:46,675 --> 01:11:49,759
reveals you to yourself and become
another woman, another person.

792
01:11:49,928 --> 01:11:53,628
That person who slept deep inside,
and who only waited on

793
01:11:53,807 --> 01:11:56,843
to thrive,
to come to life.

794
01:11:57,144 --> 01:12:00,512
And that's really nice to feel that finally
,

795
01:12:00,688 --> 01:12:02,267
to have a new life...

796
01:12:09,989 --> 01:12:10,771
Oh no...

797
01:12:29,634 --> 01:12:31,212
But...

798
01:12:32,137 --> 01:12:33,512
nobody...

799
01:12:37,475 --> 01:12:40,311
<I> Tonight, </ i>
<i> before the end of the holiday, </ i>

800
01:12:40,479 --> 01:12:45,140
<i> a big masked ball </ i>
<i> Hotel Beau Rivage <. / i>

801
01:12:56,161 --> 01:12:59,115
Tomorrow we go away and then
we will never see each other.

802
01:12:59,289 --> 01:13:02,374
No, it is not inevitable!
- What is a disaster?

803
01:13:02,667 --> 01:13:05,205
That life forces us to something we do not want.

804
01:13:05,628 --> 01:13:08,250
As beetroot meal, for example...

805
01:13:08,632 --> 01:13:11,123
But we can do something about it.
- What?

806
01:13:11,426 --> 01:13:15,091
We go to the fort, on the edge of the forest
. No one will find us

807
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:17,754
and we can calm and happy life.

808
01:13:19,726 --> 01:13:20,889
I do not know.

809
01:13:21,353 --> 01:13:23,926
Why, are you afraid?
- No it is not.

810
01:13:24,105 --> 01:13:25,480
What is it?

811
01:13:30,195 --> 01:13:31,440
You are not free.

812
01:13:35,492 --> 01:13:37,484
& Apos; Best Marie-Edwige,

813
01:13:38,495 --> 01:13:41,330
I know this letter your
grief will do... & apos;

814
01:13:41,915 --> 01:13:43,955
No, & apos; much grief

815
01:13:44,417 --> 01:13:45,876
but unfortunately,

816
01:13:46,836 --> 01:13:48,497
I make it out...

817
01:13:49,714 --> 01:13:52,170
forever & apos;.
- You sure?

818
01:13:56,179 --> 01:13:58,670
& Apos; for I do not love you...

819
01:14:00,559 --> 01:14:02,350
but Isabelle & apos;.

820
01:14:03,437 --> 01:14:05,394
So now your name.

821
01:14:07,941 --> 01:14:11,274
They will not be very happy.
- Yeah, so.

822
01:14:41,641 --> 01:14:43,135
Join me now ?!

823
01:14:47,855 --> 01:14:49,979
Mummies, what a good idea!

824
01:14:50,150 --> 01:14:53,353
<I> No, </ i> is the context
due to sunstroke.

825
01:14:53,862 --> 01:14:55,439
Devils, that & apos; s...

826
01:15:29,439 --> 01:15:33,057
You scared me.
- And? Looks good, huh?

827
01:15:34,402 --> 01:15:36,479
Mrs....

828
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:38,823
Sir?

829
01:15:40,700 --> 01:15:42,159
Sir?

830
01:15:43,829 --> 01:15:46,070
Come dance. <I> Scusi... </ i>

831
01:15:56,967 --> 01:15:58,924
No more rabbits.

832
01:15:59,302 --> 01:16:03,086
And I can not find them.
There is no more in this wild forest.

833
01:16:09,187 --> 01:16:10,266
Health.

834
01:16:25,328 --> 01:16:26,870
I do not sleep anymore.

835
01:16:27,247 --> 01:16:28,527
I do not eat more!

836
01:16:29,166 --> 01:16:30,909
Come with me!

837
01:16:31,292 --> 01:16:33,166
Let's go, right now!

838
01:16:33,545 --> 01:16:35,252
Rome will be at your feet!

839
01:16:35,547 --> 01:16:37,504
After Rome, Hollywood!

840
01:16:37,757 --> 01:16:40,793
Where are you going?
- I'm going to see where Nicholas is.

841
01:17:25,555 --> 01:17:27,464
Yes, is good.

842
01:17:27,682 --> 01:17:29,722
We just need a little tidying up.

843
01:17:29,893 --> 01:17:30,924
Yes.

844
01:17:41,529 --> 01:17:43,154
Help  agree!

845
01:17:46,242 --> 01:17:49,576
Watch out!
- You still arrested him reversed!

846
01:18:10,976 --> 01:18:12,719
& Apos; It's finished! Will you eat?

847
01:18:13,145 --> 01:18:15,979
I'm coming.
I am trying to candles to stabbing.

848
01:18:26,992 --> 01:18:29,483
& Apos; Dear mom and dad, with Isabelle

849
01:18:29,661 --> 01:18:33,706
I decided to flee together
live where nobody can find us.

850
01:18:33,874 --> 01:18:36,875
In the beginning, I did not get married,

851
01:18:37,669 --> 01:18:40,041
but I changed my mind.
Do not be sad,

852
01:18:40,213 --> 01:18:42,502
because we are very happy. Nicholas & apos.;

853
01:18:42,674 --> 01:18:44,713
When Isabelle was the same on her bed.

854
01:18:44,885 --> 01:18:46,960
And she has her briefcase along
with her clothes.

855
01:18:47,137 --> 01:18:48,417
This was bound to happen.

856
01:18:48,597 --> 01:18:50,755
Yes, with what he has to endure because of you,

857
01:18:50,932 --> 01:18:52,130
is logical he flees!

858
01:18:52,308 --> 01:18:55,393
And with my daughter in the bargain!
- What must endure my son?

859
01:18:55,687 --> 01:18:58,439
Stop this with the charade!
You let your family live in poverty.

860
01:18:58,773 --> 01:19:00,683
What? I let my family live in poverty?

861
01:19:00,984 --> 01:19:02,359
Exactly!
Everyone knows that you're broke.

862
01:19:02,652 --> 01:19:05,653
I broke?
- Yup.

863
01:19:05,947 --> 01:19:08,236
Stop! When Nicholas and Isabelle
fled,

864
01:19:08,408 --> 01:19:10,317
we must find them as quickly as possible.
- You are right.

865
01:19:10,494 --> 01:19:12,285
We need to start a search.
- I'll call the police.

866
01:19:12,454 --> 01:19:13,533
Yes, hurry up. Out of the way!

867
01:19:16,124 --> 01:19:17,120
Tell!

868
01:19:17,458 --> 01:19:18,834
Where are they?

869
01:19:19,711 --> 01:19:22,416
The first one says they are to
the old fort on the edge of the forest,

870
01:19:22,589 --> 01:19:24,628
who gets a bash!
- Come on!

871
01:19:29,429 --> 01:19:31,801
We take my car,
that much faster.

872
01:19:32,599 --> 01:19:34,259
Thank you, Commander. Do it quickly.

873
01:19:34,643 --> 01:19:36,386
Yes, on the bill!

874
01:20:15,892 --> 01:20:17,055
Nicholas!

875
01:20:18,395 --> 01:20:19,260
Ma'am,

876
01:20:19,687 --> 01:20:21,099
wait for me!

877
01:20:21,773 --> 01:20:23,148
Nicholas!

878
01:20:53,138 --> 01:20:54,169
Halt!

879
01:20:54,347 --> 01:20:57,218
Well, we drive them into a corner, then
can not withdraw them.

880
01:20:57,392 --> 01:21:00,013
You, this way,
and you, come with me!

881
01:21:01,980 --> 01:21:04,471
Isabelle?
- Nicholas?

882
01:21:48,944 --> 01:21:51,517
Hey, you! What are you doing?

883
01:21:51,696 --> 01:21:53,985
I said, on a line!
- Of course, but I'm...

884
01:21:54,282 --> 01:21:57,532
buts Nothing! Obey!
- But I...

885
01:21:59,413 --> 01:22:00,575
No, I...

886
01:22:01,248 --> 01:22:02,872
But I... - Come on! Hurry up!

887
01:22:04,292 --> 01:22:05,538
Shoot! Hurry up!

888
01:22:33,864 --> 01:22:36,022
I'm cold.
- Yes me too.

889
01:22:38,118 --> 01:22:39,660
Are we going back?

890
01:22:43,999 --> 01:22:45,872
RISK TO LIFE

891
01:23:01,433 --> 01:23:04,636
<i> Ma guarda, va a fare una gentilezza </ i>
<i> all personel </ i>

892
01:23:04,936 --> 01:23:06,976
<i> Ma almeno aspetta... </ i>
- Nicholas!

893
01:23:14,738 --> 01:23:15,687
No!

894
01:23:16,281 --> 01:23:18,273
No, shut up, Massimo!

895
01:23:18,575 --> 01:23:22,869
I beg you, do not say a word.
Since our evening I am no longer myself.

896
01:23:23,038 --> 01:23:25,410
It is as if the heavens opened
me.

897
01:23:25,707 --> 01:23:28,624
Rome, Hollywood, champagne,
the lazy life,

898
01:23:28,793 --> 01:23:30,335
you're irresistible.

899
01:23:30,795 --> 01:23:32,954
That you indeed for everyone.

900
01:23:34,299 --> 01:23:35,378
But...

901
01:23:36,217 --> 01:23:38,210
I'm not going with you, Massimo.

902
01:23:39,971 --> 01:23:42,806
No.
Because I know you, Massimo.

903
01:23:42,974 --> 01:23:44,967
And I know what kind of guy
you have been.

904
01:23:45,143 --> 01:23:48,346
I've met anyone so when I was 20.
His name was George.

905
01:23:49,272 --> 01:23:52,558
He was clever, funny, ambitious...

906
01:23:53,651 --> 01:23:54,896
But it was too much.

907
01:23:55,070 --> 01:23:57,608
He did everything he was all.

908
01:23:58,531 --> 01:23:59,907
And I...

909
01:24:00,617 --> 01:24:02,159
& apos; t is simple,
but I no longer existed.

910
01:24:04,538 --> 01:24:07,159
And then there was this other guy who was there

911
01:24:07,332 --> 01:24:10,499
a sudden, without noise, without fanfare...

912
01:24:11,461 --> 01:24:14,213
He was shy, awkward,

913
01:24:14,547 --> 01:24:16,339
a bit irritable, but .. .

914
01:24:18,885 --> 01:24:21,293
but I... how do I say...

915
01:24:22,973 --> 01:24:24,348
him...

916
01:24:25,517 --> 01:24:27,556
I felt myself.

917
01:24:28,103 --> 01:24:29,894
So I chose him.

918
01:24:30,063 --> 01:24:32,636
And that is the choice I want to make today
again.

919
01:24:33,441 --> 01:24:34,816
Because in the end...

920
01:24:35,902 --> 01:24:37,645
I love him.

921
01:24:42,784 --> 01:24:46,533
No, do not insist! This is my decision,
I hope you respect that.

922
01:24:46,830 --> 01:24:50,364
Thanks for the great things you
said, but I believe I have to go now.

923
01:24:50,541 --> 01:24:53,626
And I think it is better that we do not see each other
. Farewell.

924
01:25:06,766 --> 01:25:10,681
Fiddlesticks!
What kind of a beast!

925
01:25:14,858 --> 01:25:17,349
Stand, bunny.

926
01:25:17,902 --> 01:25:19,397
Come to Daddy.

927
01:25:25,952 --> 01:25:27,577
Stay back, bunny!

928
01:25:41,176 --> 01:25:42,551
What should imagine this!

929
01:25:43,970 --> 01:25:46,010
There's not a fortress at all!

930
01:25:48,475 --> 01:25:50,598
They have kept us fooled.

931
01:26:59,837 --> 01:27:02,375
If that child had a father
which was less strict,

932
01:27:02,549 --> 01:27:04,257
things like this would not happen.

933
01:27:05,260 --> 01:27:07,751
I think Nicholas has just the father
he needs.

934
01:27:07,929 --> 01:27:09,506
In any case, I chose that for him

935
01:27:09,681 --> 01:27:12,516
and I like the drop
no reflection on my choice.

936
01:27:13,351 --> 01:27:15,344
Come, I'm tired.

937
01:27:16,938 --> 01:27:18,267
Kiss?

938
01:27:30,160 --> 01:27:32,236
Walk me not for the feet!

939
01:27:33,246 --> 01:27:34,740
You come yet?
- Yup.

940
01:27:34,915 --> 01:27:38,366
I do not want to return home!
- I'll just leave you here!

941
01:27:38,543 --> 01:27:40,999
I do not want you to leave me here!
- Eight hundred,

942
01:27:41,171 --> 01:27:45,631
nine hundred, thousand, eleven hundred and twelve
, please.

943
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:47,674
My grandmother always said:
& apos; He who pays his debts,

944
01:27:47,844 --> 01:27:49,801
enriched themselves & apos ;.
- That's right.

945
01:27:51,306 --> 01:27:55,600
Well, then, goodbye but, hey.
- Yeah, see you then.

946
01:27:56,144 --> 01:27:57,638
No grudges?

947
01:27:58,563 --> 01:28:00,307
Okay, no grudges.

948
01:28:00,481 --> 01:28:03,933
Ah, the phone!
That's still 53 francs.

949
01:28:05,362 --> 01:28:07,900
Yes, yes, yes, but...

950
01:28:08,281 --> 01:28:10,737
Wait, I'll handle it.
- No it is not.

951
01:28:11,034 --> 01:28:12,908
I just...
- Quiet. Would you & apos; t do it for me.

952
01:28:14,079 --> 01:28:15,110
How much is it?

953
01:28:15,831 --> 01:28:17,455
53, exactly.

954
01:28:18,416 --> 01:28:20,290
Very well. 50...

955
01:28:37,811 --> 01:28:40,053
No thank you, I do not like.

956
01:28:45,527 --> 01:28:47,899
When I get back I'll write every day.

957
01:28:48,071 --> 01:28:49,316
Your promise?

958
01:28:51,324 --> 01:28:52,487
Here.

959
01:28:52,659 --> 01:28:54,652
Then you can always think of me.

960
01:29:48,131 --> 01:29:49,590
What are you doing?

961
01:29:52,594 --> 01:29:53,708
And you?

962
01:29:56,932 --> 01:29:59,505
Come on, over three days, they come back.

963
01:29:59,976 --> 01:30:01,636
That will take another century.

964
01:30:08,526 --> 01:30:11,978
Vacation is fine, but it's always good
to come home, huh?

965
01:30:18,787 --> 01:30:21,456
What are you doing?
- Yes, I relax.

966
01:30:21,623 --> 01:30:25,324
No, there's no time for that.
We must unpack the suitcases, bring to the basement

967
01:30:25,502 --> 01:30:27,744
sleeves get off, replace carpet,
you can not rest now.

968
01:30:27,921 --> 01:30:30,044
But we certainly do not hurry.
- Tomorrow you'll be back in the office

969
01:30:30,215 --> 01:30:33,418
And then I have to do everything alone.
No way! Do you hear me?

970
01:30:42,227 --> 01:30:44,184
They may, however, she is tired.

971
01:30:45,313 --> 01:30:48,682
<I> & apos; Dear Isabelle, </ i>
<i> here life goes on, </ i>

972
01:30:48,858 --> 01:30:51,859
<i> but I think you all the time... & apos; < / i>

973
01:30:52,820 --> 01:30:54,363
Hello, Nicholas.

974
01:30:56,324 --> 01:30:57,439
Hello.

975
01:31:03,373 --> 01:31:07,501
Did you have a nice holiday?
- Yup. And you, you had a nice holiday?

976
01:31:09,838 --> 01:31:11,166
Did you get my letters?

977
01:31:12,173 --> 01:31:13,751
I had made a mistake in the address.

978
01:31:15,427 --> 01:31:19,839
But did you really write me?
- Yup. And several times even.

979
01:31:20,765 --> 01:31:22,094
That's nice.

980
01:31:24,644 --> 01:31:26,720
You have become golden brown.

981
01:31:28,773 --> 01:31:31,229
If you want you can play with me Thursday.

982
01:31:36,656 --> 01:31:39,408
<I> & apos; Isabelle, I hope the good </ i>
<i> are you </ i>

983
01:31:39,784 --> 01:31:42,572
<i> Here is the weather </ i>
<i>. with a few clouds. </ i>

984
01:31:44,122 --> 01:31:48,583
<I> For tomorrow they expect downpours </ i>
<i> with a few sunny spells </ i>

985
01:31:48,835 --> 01:31:50,828
<i> Signed: Nicholas & apos; </ i>

986
01:32:39,219 --> 01:32:40,713
Dear Isabelle,

987
01:32:43,098 --> 01:32:45,767
I know that you will do a lot of sadness...

988
01:32:47,477 --> 01:32:49,351
but I've been thinking...

989
01:32:50,021 --> 01:32:52,310
we better stop writing.

990
01:32:54,025 --> 01:32:55,685
Forever.
