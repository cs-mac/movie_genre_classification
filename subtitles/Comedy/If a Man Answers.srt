1
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:45,167
If a man answers your phone
when I call

2
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:50,110
Whoa, there's gonna be some screamin'
and that ain't all

3
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:54,416
'Cause if I'm-a here callin' you

4
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:57,047
Then who's the who
I'm talkin' to

5
00:00:57,123 --> 00:00:59,751
Why, any fool could see

6
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:02,386
That for sure it ain't me

7
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:06,125
So if a man answers your phone
then, honey, we're through

8
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:13,267
Now, everything between us
used to be fine

9
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:15,967
Until I became a third party

10
00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:18,738
Where there ain't no party line
You hear me talkin'

11
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:22,248
Gonna hang-a this phone up now
and dial again

12
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:28,647
Whoa, and there better be a soprano
on the other end

13
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:32,318
'Cause if the voice is baritone

14
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:34,986
When you told me
you'd be home alone

15
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:41,091
Well, then I'm wastin' my time
not to mention my dime

16
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:44,466
So if a man answers your phone
then, honey, I'm gone

17
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:21,639
Maman, my mother,
was born in Paris in the spring.

18
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:27,169
It is obvious a lot more than chestnuts
blossom in the City of Love in the spring.

19
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:46,661
Mother is French...
Very.

20
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:50,191
This came in handy when she
worked at the Folies Bergère.

21
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:57,633
Father was born in Boston...

22
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,905
where things were labeled "His";...

23
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:05,008
and "Hers", because
they really weren't sure.

24
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:23,500
In the beginning, Father considered "Me
Tarzan, you Jane" an adequate sex education.

25
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,630
As a result of their
soufflé-and-beans romance, I was born.

26
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:01,105
Oh, in wedlock, of course.

27
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:03,608
Father's a stickler for details.

28
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:15,452
From the first, unsuspecting males
have been victimized...

29
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:18,354
by the fighting mixtures
bubbling in my veins.

30
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:24,385
Always the Boston fog
chills my Paris springtime.

31
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:48,715
My name is Chantal.

32
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:52,155
Maman calls me chouchou.
Father calls me Charlotte.

33
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:57,153
The boys at Boston Junior College
call me tease.

34
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:01,766
Father said no one
with such a background...

35
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:03,995
ever had such a foreground.

36
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:15,378
Could be the boys at Boston Junior
are right.

37
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:23,519
Don't stop. More.

38
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:25,523
Tell me more, Richard.

39
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:27,957
Well, in this experiment,

40
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:31,986
you drill the cavity
into the labial surface of the tooth.

41
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:34,863
Then you deposit the dry dye
into the cavity.

42
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:37,630
The dyes we used
were water-soluble eosin...

43
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:40,298
or, uh, borax carmine,
organic silver salts,

44
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:42,898
silver nitrate crystals
and Congo red.

45
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:44,909
Stunning.

46
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:47,377
Chantal, how come you're
so interested in dentistry?

47
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:50,177
Oh, I'm not, but you are.

48
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:54,743
And maman says that the only thing a man would
rather do than make love is talk about himself.

49
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:58,621
So... That mother of yours
really has it figured.

50
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:01,683
The French women
are very smart in some areas.

51
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:03,888
But she can get pretty wild.

52
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:07,421
Like mother, like daughter?

53
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:19,411
Lo-Look, Richard.

54
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:22,710
These two are still my baby teeth.
Isn't that incredible?

55
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:25,216
I'll pull 'em... for free.

56
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:40,899
It's amusing.

57
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:44,801
In France, when the daughter is brought
home early, then the father begins to worry.

58
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:47,169
Who's she out there with
tonight?

59
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,641
Richard.
Darling, polite little Richard.

60
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,736
Yes. He's polite in front of us.
Too polite.

61
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:56,873
I wish that girl would get married
so I could get a good night's sleep.

62
00:06:56,949 --> 00:07:00,146
I keep seeing all of Charlotte's
young men swimming around.

63
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:03,484
- "Swimming"?
- A regular salmon run up Beacon Hill.

64
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:05,649
Oh, don't worry, love.

65
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:09,923
The Stacy blood in your daughter's veins
will cool those little fishes.

66
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:13,989
Well, she's finally remembered
she has a home.

67
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:19,496
- Charlotte!
- No one kept such a close watch on you, Mrs. Appley.

68
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:22,302
And you married well, didn't you?

69
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:25,901
Don't you two ever sleep?

70
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:30,608
Speaking for myself, I haven't had a
decent night's rest since you turned 15.

71
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:33,618
Charlotte, haven't you
ever thought of marriage?

72
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:36,553
Mm-hmm. It's fine, I guess,
for older people.

73
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,556
Isn't that right, Mrs. Appley?

74
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:41,821
I see. Well, maybe you should
continue your education...

75
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:43,953
at some nice girls' school.

76
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,999
But, Father, I'm learning
dentistry from Richard,

77
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:50,194
law from Howard
and business administration from Tom.

78
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:53,329
Keeping my dates talking,
like maman suggested,

79
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:55,533
has given me
quite a liberal education.

80
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:57,405
What did you learn tonight?

81
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:01,641
Maman, did you know that gingivitis...
And why must you keep your dates talking?

82
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:05,707
So they won't make love to me
all the time.

83
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:08,015
In heaven's name,
get married!

84
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:12,148
Well, who shall I marry? It's
"whom." Whom shall I marry?

85
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:15,592
And what's wrong with Thomas
or Richard or Howard?

86
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:19,597
Well, nothing. I like
all three of them. Well?

87
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:23,067
All right.

88
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:25,126
If that's what you want.

89
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:30,107
How? How could you have said yes
to all three of them?

90
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:33,111
It was really your fault,
darling.

91
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,545
Mine? Mine?

92
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:39,346
Well, she did it only to please you.
"Get married," you ordered.

93
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:41,909
As if the sweet, innocent child
were in disgrace.

94
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:46,755
That unpleasant eventuality
is exactly what I was trying to avoid.

95
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:51,356
I had no intention
of her reviving polygamy.

96
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,831
And I had no intention
of doing any such thing.

97
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:59,395
But you were in such a hurry that I didn't dare
take the time to decide which one I really wanted.

98
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:03,203
It was... Well, it was simply a matter
of getting engaged first...

99
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:05,972
and sorting them out later.

100
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:10,846
Well, I am abjectly sorry for anything
I might have had to do, indirectly,

101
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:13,579
with your multiple choice.

102
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:17,919
Now, Charlotte, the thing for
you to do is return the rings.

103
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,924
You mean, I...

104
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:21,926
You heard your father.

105
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:25,225
Besides, chouchou, for men
you're not desperately in love with,

106
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:27,766
these rings are much too small.

107
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,767
I thought maybe
if I bunched them up...

108
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:31,769
Look, Maman...
Charlotte!

109
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,513
Oh, Maman, what's the use?

110
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,744
Whom am I ever
gonna get a chance to cook for?

111
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:48,514
Do you realize that nobody's
asked me to marry them in a week?

112
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,522
Your fire is much too high.

113
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,616
Let it simmer,
and the lumps will work out.

114
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:55,820
You, Chantal, must simmer also.

115
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:58,625
Hmm.
You can turn the fire out under me.

116
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:01,030
I'm finished.
Oh, now.

117
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,660
Greetings, greetings,
greetings.

118
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:05,727
You're early.

119
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:08,035
Mm, yes, I guess I am.

120
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,166
Hello, Father.

121
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:12,437
Evening, Mr. Stacy.
Good evening.

122
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:21,953
This old barn's gonna fall down
around our ears one day.

123
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:24,717
Something is up.

124
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,621
What makes you say that?

125
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:30,822
Chouchou, you must always
observe your man closely.

126
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:33,797
The male animal
discloses very little audibly.

127
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:37,893
Now, one, my man did not have
the evening Boston Globe...

128
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,961
a serious break in routine.

129
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:43,270
Two, he said he guessed
he was home early.

130
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:46,505
Your father always knows exactly
what time of day it is.

131
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:49,377
Three, I have a rack of lamb
in the oven... his favorite...

132
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:51,382
and he didn't even smell it.

133
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:55,250
Now, four... and most important...
he criticized this house.

134
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,949
Oh, yes, something
is most definitely up.

135
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:03,755
Simmer.
Your fire is anything but out.

136
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:12,167
What took you so long?

137
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,572
Mm. Now I'm sure.

138
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:25,412
You never kiss me like that
before dark.

139
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:29,944
What is it? How would you
like to live in New York?

140
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,456
I would love it.
Just like that?

141
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,459
Are we moving to New York?

142
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,655
I've had a magnificent offer to go
into partnership with a Mr. Berwitt,

143
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,790
one of the country's leading dealers
in English antiques.

144
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:45,166
Quite flattering, I must say.
Then, voilà, it is done.

145
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:47,797
So easy? You won't mind leaving Boston?

146
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:51,502
My darling, I left Paris for you.

147
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:53,568
After that, anything is easy.

148
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:57,377
We will be New Yorkers now.
Yes, we will like that.

149
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,749
New Yorkers?
Are we moving to New York?

150
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,880
Are we?
Yes, and won't you love it.

151
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:07,551
Well, how can you be so positive?
How can you look so negative?

152
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:12,120
I asked you first. For one thing,
New York men are so recherché.

153
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:14,325
I hope that means
the marrying kind.

154
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,698
Well, I hope it means
exciting and plentiful.

155
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:20,569
All the men you really
need is one. Mm-hmm.

156
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,735
One tall, dark, handsome,
witty, rich,

157
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:27,370
single New Yorker.

158
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:30,506
Is that asking too much
of such a fabulous city?

159
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:34,245
You're not gonna buy that hat.

160
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,651
Not if you don't want me to.

161
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,451
I don't think a pretty girl should
ever have to buy a silly hat for herself.

162
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:48,357
Especially not today.

163
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:51,260
My name is Eugene Wright.
I'm Chantal Stacy.

164
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,264
Of course the Stacy's
only temporary.

165
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,630
Oh, you're getting married?
Eventually.

166
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:57,828
Aren't you? Eventually. It could happen.

167
00:13:57,903 --> 00:14:00,497
Then you're not married now.
No, of course not.

168
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:02,564
By that, I gather
you're not engaged either.

169
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:05,007
You know, you'd be a whiz
at 20 questions.

170
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:07,011
I hate games.
So do I.

171
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:09,013
No, I'm not engaged.

172
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:11,276
This is the darndest personal
conversation for two strangers.

173
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:15,252
How did we get on it in the first
place? You asked me if I was married.

174
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:18,779
I did? I guess I did at that.
But we have made progress.

175
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,520
Now, shall we, uh,
see about that hat?

176
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:59,459
Look, Miss Stacy, you misunderstood
me. No. No, Mr. Wright.

177
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:02,091
Even though I am half French,
when a perfect stranger tells you...

178
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:04,692
his interest in you is
purely physical... Mon Dieu!

179
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:08,206
Yeah, but you didn't let me finish. I'd like
you to come over to my place tomorrow at 2:00.

180
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:10,242
$10 an hour.

181
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:21,213
Miss Stacy, I am a gentleman.

182
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:23,585
I am also a photographer,
which explains the $10 an hour.

183
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:25,590
My card.

184
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:28,884
Oh, I see.

185
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:31,191
You're not a model?
No.

186
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,595
Oh, uh, not...
not at the moment.

187
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,691
I see. Well, I thought
perhaps you might be...

188
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,236
and that I'd better clear myself
in case we ever meet again...

189
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:41,572
professionally.

190
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,575
Good day, Miss Stacy.
I'm off to collect my Blue Cross.

191
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,818
This belongs in the library.

192
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:05,554
Oh, put the rest of the books
on the shelves.

193
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:09,965
Now, couldn't this sofa
go over here, my pet?

194
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:12,026
Mm, mm-hmm.
Should be fine.

195
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:16,165
Good afternoon, Mrs. Appley.

196
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:18,232
Bonjour, Madame Stacy
et Monsieur Stacy.

197
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,244
Comment allez-vous?
Très bien.

198
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,906
And it is obvious
things are très bien with you.

199
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,280
I have a job.

200
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:28,809
Well, our little girl is
growing up at last. Oh!

201
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:30,821
What's the name of the firm,
Charlotte?

202
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:33,084
Well, it's not exactly a firm, Father.

203
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,558
It's more of a one-man operation.

204
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:38,926
- Oh.
- You did say one was all I really needed.

205
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,660
Well, then who is the gentleman?

206
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:45,898
He is a very nice man. Well,
how would you know, Germaine?

207
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:49,907
I see him shining in chouchou's
eyes. Now, just a minute.

208
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:53,206
She hardly knows the man, and, more
important, we've never even met him.

209
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:55,872
Now, where were you
introduced to him?

210
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:57,882
Oh, it was all very proper, Father.

211
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,384
He presented his card
and offered me a job.

212
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:02,443
Hmm. Well.

213
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,887
Modeling.

214
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:06,948
Modeling?

215
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,451
Modeling?

216
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,463
Telephone.

217
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,200
Stacy residence.
Yes. Just a minute.

218
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:19,203
It's for you, Father.
Now, Charlotte, listen to me.

219
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:21,762
Chouchou, help me, will you?
Yes, Maman.

220
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:26,143
John Stacy speaking.

221
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,145
Well?
He picked me up.

222
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:31,307
Chouchou. On Fifth Avenue.
He wanted to buy me a hat.

223
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,851
Perfection.
Exactly as it should be.

224
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,853
Oh, I am so happy.

225
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:50,395
Ye... Now, hold on. A fella's got just
so much Blue Cross, not to mention blood.

226
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:53,063
About your brass knuckles.

227
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:55,902
See, my sorority believes
in functional jewelry.

228
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:57,908
Won't you come in?

229
00:17:57,976 --> 00:18:02,504
Oh, my. This place could be
so attractive. Oh, thank you.

230
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,606
Of course, it would take
a great deal of imagination.

231
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:06,617
Well, I'll get
right to work on it.

232
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:09,483
Oh, bedroom upstairs? No. This
used to be a duplex, Miss Stacy.

233
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:12,251
It's now two apartments.
The stairway is just left over.

234
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:15,589
It leads to nowhere,
like this conversation.

235
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:19,119
Lots of closet space? Miss
Stacy, the studio is not for rent.

236
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:21,860
Now, if you'll excuse me, I
have some... You did say 2:00?

237
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,528
What?
2:00. $10 an hour.

238
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,969
Oh, I'm sorry, but since you told me
you weren't a model,

239
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,132
why, I called the agency,
and they're gonna send a girl over.

240
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,142
I had no idea that you would, uh...

241
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,469
I had no idea.

242
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:37,447
Of course, I could call the agency
and tell them not to bother.

243
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:40,974
Why don't you do that.
Why don't I.

244
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:53,426
Hello, Ellie? Look, can you
get a hold of Rita for me?

245
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:56,366
Good. Tell her I'm canceling today.

246
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:58,460
No, no. I'll set it up again
for sometime next week.

247
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:00,471
Thanks a lot.
So long.

248
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:06,076
My, my. Aren't we domestic.
Yes, very. It's the French in me.

249
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,705
I am an incredible cook though.
Maman taught me.

250
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,806
Well, I'm pretty famous
for my peanut butter sandwiches myself.

251
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:15,581
I don't know how you men live through
bachelorhood. Must be terrible.

252
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,884
It's great, and I wouldn't have it
any other way.

253
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:19,890
I guess my dad
set the example for me.

254
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:22,518
He enjoyed life so much
by not being married.

255
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:25,620
That is, after my mother died,
he just never remarried...

256
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:28,928
and had all of his girlfriends to bounce me
on their pretty knees and kiss me good night.

257
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,060
My dad sure could pick 'em.

258
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:33,263
He still can.
Adam Wright.

259
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,272
You must have heard of him.
No.

260
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,604
He's pretty famous
as a commercial artist too.

261
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:41,271
In fact, right now he's in Europe painting
the beautiful ladies for a cigarette campaign.

262
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:44,315
Well, it all sounds
pretty sordid to me.

263
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:52,221
Maybe you should see a psychiatrist.
Thank you, but I'm happy as I am... free.

264
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,851
Well, I guess
I have to agree with you there.

265
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:57,452
I mean, who needs the drudgery
of married life?

266
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:00,293
Still, for a man,
marriage is the ideal state.

267
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:03,630
No more sinks full of dirty dishes. No more
peanut butter sandwiches. And companionship.

268
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:08,196
May I remind you that New York is full of great
restaurants, very few of which serve peanut butter.

269
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:10,798
And for a buck and a half an hour,
all these dishes disappear.

270
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,970
And as far as companionship is concerned,
well, I have a little black book,

271
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,776
and in it are the names
and phone numbers of 111 models.

272
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:19,612
Bachelorhood
is the ideal state for a man.

273
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:23,781
Marriage, little Miss Stacy, well, that's
an institution sponsored by women for women.

274
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:25,789
When the coffee's ready,
you can bring it in.

275
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:27,791
I'm gonna set up the camera.

276
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:34,030
When the coffee's ready,
little Miss Stacy, you can bring it in.

277
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:39,895
I'm gonna submit these pictures for a
calendar that Goodman Tires is planning.

278
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:42,941
if I get the assignment,
it'll be quite a feather in my lens.

279
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:44,999
We'll shoot the month of March today.

280
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,345
Say, how goes it in there anyway?

281
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,711
Oh, I can find everything in here
but the dress.

282
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:54,616
Well, it's not a dress exactly. It's a...
Well, it's in that little white box in there.

283
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:57,086
Oh, that.
I've got that on.

284
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:00,124
Miss Stacy, this is my profession.

285
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:03,252
You have got to think of me as a doctor,
and this is my office.

286
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:06,263
- It's all quite impersonal.
- "Impersonal."

287
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:34,251
Well, I guess if Maman managed to escape pneumonia
on that drafty stage at the Folies Bergère,

288
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:37,454
I should be perfectly safe
in a steam-heated studio.

289
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:40,531
I guess.

290
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:06,720
And you say you can cook, too, huh?

291
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:08,885
Try me sometime.

292
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,397
I'd love to.

293
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:18,598
My, my.
All right, doctor?

294
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,070
All right. Here, let's get to work.

295
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:23,471
Go to the ladder, please,
right on the top. Thank you.

296
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:31,172
That's it. Now hold on to your hat.
March winds, you know.

297
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:33,877
That's it, and smile.
You like the wind.

298
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:38,048
Now take a deep breath...
chest full and high.

299
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:42,753
Higher.

300
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:44,762
A little higher, please.

301
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:49,523
That's good. Now I want you to concentrate
on... Well, think of something pleasant.

302
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:54,405
Are you thinking
of something pleasant?

303
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:05,010
Good. Hold it.

304
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:06,448
Beautiful.

305
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:09,487
Now, if you will, Miss Stacy,
concentrate on something beautiful,

306
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:12,079
something really beautiful.

307
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:26,470
Good. Good.

308
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:29,564
For this one, let's concentrate
on something absolutely wonderful...

309
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:32,041
the most wonderful thing
in the world, huh?

310
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:06,704
Wh-What are you doing?
What-What... What are you doing?

311
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:10,214
What do you mean what am I doing?
You said, "the most wonderful thing."

312
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:13,979
I know what I said. Forget it.
Simmer down to "just pleasant."

313
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:17,283
These pictures have to go
through the mails.

314
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,424
Simmer?

315
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:23,188
Oh, Maman, my fire isn't out.

316
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:27,298
Yes?

317
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:29,356
Father?

318
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:35,839
Mr. Wright, this is my father.

319
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:38,671
Father, this is...
That was Mr. Wright.

320
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,942
I got there just in time
this afternoon.

321
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:50,579
Imagine, our daughter alone with that
seedy, poverty-stricken sex maniac.

322
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:53,681
And Charlotte dressed in...
"Dressed."

323
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:57,785
Supporting a bit of lace here
and a bit of lace there. Oh!

324
00:24:57,863 --> 00:25:00,798
I remember a costume
I had once.

325
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:03,426
It was made of pink Chantilly lace...

326
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:07,268
so delicate, so lovely...
that past the third row,

327
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:10,001
you could not tell
I was wearing anything at all.

328
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:12,066
Such a waste.
There is no comparison...

329
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:15,442
And you saw me as the virgin bride
of the sea king.

330
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:18,950
It looked like I was wearing
shimmering tights, remember?

331
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:21,577
When actually I was
quite au naturel.

332
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:23,780
It was all done with lights.

333
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:29,453
Oh. Ah, the magic of the theater.

334
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:34,363
- How I loved it.
- That was Paris... a long, long time ago.

335
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:38,368
Still, I would like to parade
down the runway tonight...

336
00:25:38,436 --> 00:25:41,997
if I could hide
my extra pounds of contentment.

337
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:47,705
My pet, I'm only trying to say that
Chantal is what I am... what we are.

338
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:51,806
We are good people, and she's
a good girl. Of course she is.

339
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:56,786
But there's nothing in the book that says good
people can't meet bad people and turn out not so good.

340
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:59,380
You don't think
she'll go back there, do you?

341
00:26:01,126 --> 00:26:03,856
Not if you insist that she doesn't,

342
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:07,296
but you know what happened to
Juliet when the parents interfered.

343
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:11,165
I want Charlotte to get married,
but to a man with principles.

344
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,636
Men develop appetites
when they are 12,

345
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:15,639
muscles when they are 16...

346
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:18,403
and principles
only after they are married.

347
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:25,348
Being married
is the nicest thing to be.

348
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:28,580
Maybe so, but I'm not ready
to make the compromise yet,

349
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:30,587
and he most certainly isn't.

350
00:26:30,655 --> 00:26:33,647
Marriage is not a compromise.
It is a challenge,

351
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:35,955
a challenge you should be
ready to accept.

352
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:37,961
A challenge?
Certainly.

353
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:40,998
It takes a clever woman
to make a good husband.

354
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:43,534
That's why
there are so few of them.

355
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:47,197
It is not difficult
to keep a man interested for one evening,

356
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:50,207
but could you keep one interested
day after day...

357
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:53,733
and all through the nights?
Mm. I'd like to try.

358
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:57,111
But he said marriage is an institution
sponsored by women for women...

359
00:26:57,182 --> 00:26:59,116
and that he was never
gonna get married.

360
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:02,210
His father, Adam Wright, thinks
he's some kind of a merry widower.

361
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:05,814
And Eugene thinks it's just great how
daddy makes out with all the young girls.

362
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:09,883
He wants to be just like him...
a... dirty old man.

363
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:15,123
Um, the father is still alive?
Hmm! And pinching.

364
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,398
Well, perhaps you should save
yourself for... "the dirty old man."

365
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:23,532
Maman, be serious.
I like him very much.

366
00:27:23,608 --> 00:27:25,599
Don't make wrinkles, chouchou.

367
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:29,645
Well, I know it immodest
for me to say it,

368
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:33,047
but your maman is a genius
at this kind of thing.

369
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:37,612
Your father came to Paris
for one week to import antiques.

370
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:42,319
He had one book of traveler's checks,
two changes of pajamas.

371
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:45,761
He used all the checks,
none of the pajamas.

372
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:48,458
And the only thing he imported was moi.

373
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:54,067
Now rest assured, little chicken,
the boy has not a chance.

374
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:56,266
Marriage is our institution,

375
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:59,071
and we're not going
out of business.

376
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:07,241
Just my luck she's gotta be nuts.

377
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:20,990
And just what do you think
you're doing?

378
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:23,296
No guesswork involved.

379
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,359
Won't you come in?

380
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:31,266
Lobster crème canapé
to start with.

381
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:33,401
Good-bye, Miss Stacy. Do
you have plans for dinner?

382
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:36,242
Good-bye, Miss Stacy. Do
you like veal printanier?

383
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:38,248
I have given up eating,
Miss Stacy.

384
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:42,616
Good. Veal printanier's just the dish
to perk up one's appetite.

385
00:28:42,687 --> 00:28:45,850
Still, maybe we ought to forget
the brandy chestnut soufflé.

386
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:48,119
Well, that is if you're
really not famished.

387
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:50,684
What'd you have for lunch?
I didn't have lunch, Miss Stacy.

388
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:53,560
Oh, then by all means
the brandy chestnut soufflé.

389
00:28:53,631 --> 00:28:55,565
And dumplings for the veal.

390
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:58,363
Maman suggested
the potage Crécy.

391
00:28:58,436 --> 00:29:01,997
What a tragic waste of good food.
Oh? You changed your plans?

392
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:04,871
Your telephone service said that
you'd be in the darkroom all day, but,

393
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:07,275
well, that you would be home
this evening.

394
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:10,109
The information is correct,
but limited.

395
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:13,173
They failed to report
whether I'd be home alone...

396
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:15,242
or not.

397
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:28,022
Hi, doll.

398
00:29:56,294 --> 00:30:00,253
Oh, don't worry about me. I'll just cook
and serve the dinner and then get lost.

399
00:30:00,331 --> 00:30:02,526
I guess I owe you that
at least.

400
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,592
Gee, your jaw looks better.
How's your eye?

401
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:08,138
You mean you'd really
play the maid?

402
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:11,573
What time would you like
your aperitifs, Mr. Wright, sir?

403
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:15,238
I'll bet you even have a
bicarbonate in there. Certainly not.

404
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:18,373
White mint,
which I will frappé beautifully.

405
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:21,316
Or I might add brandy, and you
and the lady could have a stinger.

406
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:23,377
I don't know.
Which would the lady prefer?

407
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:25,445
Ask her.
I am.

408
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:27,514
Which would the lady prefer?

409
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:38,392
She just came by
to pick up some pictures.

410
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:42,331
Oh, then it's just gonna be
the two of us.

411
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:45,240
And your father, of course.
Uh-uh.

412
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:48,711
Maman reminded him what happened in
Verona when the parents got in the act.

413
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,873
Well, we're hardly Romeo and Juliet.

414
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:53,076
In fact, we're hardly anything at all.

415
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:55,915
And after tonight, probably
we won't ever see each other again.

416
00:30:55,987 --> 00:30:58,455
Ever... probably.

417
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:20,775
You know, the agency men
think you're beautiful.

418
00:31:20,845 --> 00:31:23,245
I showed them the pictures,
and they got all excited.

419
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:25,339
I, uh, could have that calendar job.

420
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:27,782
Gene, that's marvelous.
Congratulations.

421
00:31:27,852 --> 00:31:29,877
Hmm. It's all very sad though.

422
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:33,287
I could have the job,
but only with you as the model.

423
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:37,021
Oh, I'm sorry, Gene,
but my father would never approve.

424
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:39,120
Oh, but don't fret.
It'll all work out.

425
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:42,633
I'm sure of it,
and so is Maman.

426
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:46,928
Why, it's so simple, I wonder why
I didn't think of it before. What?

427
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:50,338
I'm sure the idea must have occurred
to you. Oh, of course it has.

428
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:53,906
What's occurred to me?

429
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:56,640
Well, marrying me so that my father
wouldn't have any say in the matter.

430
00:31:56,714 --> 00:31:58,841
What!

431
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:02,648
No, I'm sorry, Eugene,
but that's not good enough for me.

432
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:06,422
Now, just a minute. I don't
have to consider it for a second.

433
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:08,425
The answer is no.

434
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:10,984
You are a nut.
A nut.

435
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:13,587
Because I won't marry you
just to further your career?

436
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:18,534
Strange as it might seem to you, there are still
a lot of people in this world who marry for love.

437
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:21,265
I'm terribly disappointed in you,
Mr. Wright.

438
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:23,603
Getting married
was the farthest thing from my mind.

439
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:25,973
That's what I thought. I mean,
that's why I'm so surprised.

440
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:28,808
I never dreamed it would
come to this, and so suddenly.

441
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,871
Have you forgotten what you
told me about your father?

442
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:34,885
Not for one minute. And I
wouldn't if I were you, ever.

443
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:37,251
Men like you and your father
shouldn't even consider being husbands.

444
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:40,189
It's... Well, it's an unfair challenge.
An unfair chal...

445
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:43,591
Oh, you are a charming date,
but I can't help wondering...

446
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:47,392
could you manage to keep a lady
interested day after day after day...

447
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:49,990
and all through the nights, hmm?

448
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:52,127
I'm not so sure.
Could I keep a...

449
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:58,168
It's happened again. Suddenly I'm deep in a conversation,
and I haven't the slightest idea how I got into it.

450
00:32:58,242 --> 00:33:00,335
Perhaps this will
help you out of it.

451
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:03,039
Good night.

452
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:05,241
Hey, wait a minute.
What...

453
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:42,083
Don't disturb yourself, chéri.
That will be for Chantal.

454
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:46,346
It's...
It's a quarter after 3:00.

455
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:50,793
Well, some things are not
done by the clock. What?

456
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:53,296
Mr. Wright has accepted
the challenge.

457
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:56,731
He has come to propose.
"Propose"?

458
00:33:56,801 --> 00:33:59,269
Why, Charlotte hasn't known him
any time at all.

459
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:02,033
You proposed to me
the day after we met,

460
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:04,700
and we had a language barrier.

461
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:07,267
- Come back to bed.
- Well...

462
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:12,271
Shouldn't we... go down there?
Certainly not.

463
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:15,717
My future son-in-law is not going
to see me looking like this.

464
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:18,347
It would be a disadvantage
I might never overcome.

465
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:23,754
To bed, grand-papa.
At last you can get some sleep.

466
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,803
The house is full of love.

467
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:47,183
Incredible.

468
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:49,719
As father of the bride,
I'm very proud.

469
00:34:49,787 --> 00:34:52,551
My only wish is that the father
of the groom could be here...

470
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:55,183
to realize what a lucky father-in-law
he's becoming.

471
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,887
He sent us a lovely cable
from Madrid today.

472
00:34:57,962 --> 00:34:59,953
He wants a photograph of me.

473
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:02,431
Gene's going to send him
the best of my wedding pictures.

474
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:07,334
Oh. "My wedding."

475
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:09,339
Oh, Father.

476
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:12,567
Something borrowed.

477
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,603
From the Folies Bergère.

478
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:20,583
Well, I'll be waiting at the top of
the stairs with a good steady arm.

479
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:22,642
You look like a bride yourself.
Oh.

480
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,711
You do.

481
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:28,582
Well.

482
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:33,530
Oh, Maman, I am so afraid.
Of love?

483
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:36,499
Mm-mmm.
Of being disappointed in it.

484
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:40,333
Chouchou,
if you come to love and say to it,

485
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:45,603
"If you're so wonderful,
please me, satisfy me, fulfill me,"

486
00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:47,701
then you probably
will be disappointed.

487
00:35:47,778 --> 00:35:51,976
It all depends on what
you yourself bring to it.

488
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:54,244
Don't you disappoint love.

489
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:57,515
Maman, thank God for you.

490
00:35:57,588 --> 00:35:59,613
Thank God for love.

491
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,945
Hey, Chantal.

492
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,504
Hey, where is everybody?
Over here, boss.

493
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:27,551
All of us, ready for work.

494
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:29,677
June bride for the calendar.

495
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:32,018
Maman copied it
from one of her old costumes.

496
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:34,250
Honey, she has a sensational idea
for July...

497
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:37,260
with a star, a stripe
and a great big firecracker.

498
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:39,956
You get dressed.
But, honey...

499
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:43,194
No wife of mine is going
to display herself in any calendar.

500
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:46,100
But the job, the agency men...
You said it meant so much.

501
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:48,604
Charlotte, I said get dressed.

502
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:52,131
- Un homme est un homme jusqu'a ce qu'il se marie.
- What?

503
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:55,202
"A man is a man until he marries.
Then he becomes a husband."

504
00:37:00,284 --> 00:37:04,653
All right. What would the children think with
Mama bursting forth from January to December?

505
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:09,317
"Children"? Oh, Eugene,
what a lovely idea.

506
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:11,384
We are gonna have
such a lovely life together.

507
00:37:11,462 --> 00:37:14,761
I can hardly wait.
Everything is just perfect.

508
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:58,637
Tina?
Tina, welcome to New York.

509
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:01,405
If I didn't know you were just
my old classmate from Boston Junior,

510
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:03,504
I'd say for sure you were a movie star!

511
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:05,515
Oh, watch the hair, honey.

512
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:09,110
And you, Chantal, you've
definitely got that married look.

513
00:38:09,186 --> 00:38:11,120
And doesn't it agree with you.

514
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:13,884
I like your face fuller.

515
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:17,792
Oh, I can't believe it. Only
yesterday, we were playing house.

516
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:20,092
About your husband,
is he cute?

517
00:38:20,164 --> 00:38:23,930
Oh, he's very nice. Oh,
if I know you, he's a doll.

518
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:27,300
Oh, but New York is full
of marvelous-looking men.

519
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:31,774
And they all have that look of just
having had martinis with their secretaries.

520
00:38:31,842 --> 00:38:34,970
Nonsense. The majority look
very much like the men in Boston,

521
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:36,980
armies of them in little dark suits.

522
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:40,017
Yes, but, in Boston,
those little suits fit.

523
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:43,542
Here they seem to be bursting at
the seams. I'm going to love it.

524
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:46,590
How long do you plan
to stay, Tina?

525
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:49,353
Oh, darling,
I'm here for good...

526
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:51,418
or bad.

527
00:38:58,436 --> 00:39:00,370
What a cute little place.

528
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:02,872
Thank you.
Make yourself at home.

529
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:07,602
He's left you? Gene had to go out
for a while. He'll be back soon.

530
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:10,044
Here, I'll take that.
Oh.

531
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:13,709
Gee, I like your coat.
What's up the stairs?

532
00:39:13,784 --> 00:39:16,446
Another apartment.
This used to be a duplex.

533
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:21,355
- Can't you chop it down or something?
- We like it.

534
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:27,396
Oh, I get it. You like it because you can
tuck yourself away at the top of the stairs...

535
00:39:27,465 --> 00:39:29,933
and keep an eye on daddy
with all those sexy models.

536
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,230
Mm-hmm, an excellent perch.

537
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:36,296
Don't be ridiculous. True, Gene does work
with some of the world's most beautiful women,

538
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:39,138
and, true, they are anything
but overdressed, but it's...

539
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:43,237
Well, he's their... their doctor,
and-and this is his office.

540
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:46,408
It's all very professional and...
and terribly impersonal.

541
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:49,419
Sometime let me tell you about
a doctor I went to in Boston.

542
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:52,820
Hmm, what a peppy type.
I should have sent him the bill.

543
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:56,121
- Eugene is a married man.
- The worst kind.

544
00:39:57,361 --> 00:39:59,295
Sit down, Tina.

545
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:01,831
Would you like a drink?
Mm. Scotch on the rocks.

546
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:05,665
Are you gonna look for a job,
do you think?

547
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:07,761
Well, my parents were so glad
to get rid of me,

548
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:10,705
they gave me a blank checkbook
as a going-away present.

549
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:13,005
But if the right boss
should happen along...

550
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:15,136
Hi, honey.

551
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:18,443
Boy, I got some fantastic shots
this afternoon.

552
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:21,781
The light couldn't have been more perfect, and I
was always in the right place at the right time.

553
00:40:21,852 --> 00:40:23,786
The agency called me
just after you left.

554
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:40,001
I'm Tina, Chantal's old school chum.

555
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:42,004
You must be Gene.

556
00:40:42,072 --> 00:40:44,336
Well, of course it's Gene.
Good heavens.

557
00:40:44,408 --> 00:40:48,003
Don't let her kid you. I'm the Good Humor
man. Gene's a little squinty guy with a camera.

558
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:51,070
Oh, Chantal, you didn't say
half enough about him.

559
00:40:51,148 --> 00:40:55,209
He's very attractive. Well,
I'm sure glad to meet you, Tina.

560
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:58,722
My, my. The boys in Boston better mend their
fences, lettin' you and Chantal get away.

561
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,723
Well, I'll say this much for Chantal.

562
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:04,056
She managed to get engaged
to most of them before she left.

563
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:06,995
O-Oh, could I fix you a drink, Gene?

564
00:41:07,064 --> 00:41:08,998
No. I'll fix it myself.

565
00:41:09,066 --> 00:41:11,830
Say, uh... Say, Tina,
are you a dancer?

566
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:16,032
I've, uh, danced in my time. Oh?
How about modeling in your time?

567
00:41:16,106 --> 00:41:18,870
Haven't gotten around to it yet.
Here, what do you think?

568
00:41:19,944 --> 00:41:23,038
Make you want to, uh, buy it?

569
00:41:23,113 --> 00:41:25,013
By the gallon.

570
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:29,478
I think I'll see about dinner.

571
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:35,724
I said I think I'll see about dinner.

572
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:37,522
What, hon?

573
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:39,722
I think I'll see about dinner.

574
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:43,233
Oh, good, good. Say, Tina,
the Goodman Tire Company...

575
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,291
puts out
a very elaborate calendar every year.

576
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:49,135
I came pretty close to doing the artwork
on it this year, but I just missed out.

577
00:41:49,206 --> 00:41:53,267
So, I was, uh... Well, I was thinking
of planning my next year's pitch now.

578
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:57,973
You look like a little bit
of perfection up there.

579
00:41:58,048 --> 00:42:02,041
Yes, yes, a little bit of perfection.
Now hold it a minute.

580
00:42:03,153 --> 00:42:05,713
Uh-huh.

581
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:08,257
Hey, Tina, do me a favor.
Take a deep breath.

582
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:11,954
That's it. That's it.
And your chest full and high.

583
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:16,193
Higher. A little higher.
Okay, boss.

584
00:42:16,267 --> 00:42:18,394
Yeah, good.
Now think of something beautiful.

585
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:20,232
Really beautiful, huh?

586
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:22,238
Thinkin' of something beautiful?
Mm-hmm.

587
00:42:22,306 --> 00:42:23,864
Good. Just...

588
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:27,240
Hold that way,
you good-lookin' thing you.

589
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:32,907
Hold it a second, Tina.
Yeah, face front, honey.

590
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:35,474
- I wanna set this backlight.
Keep facing front. - Mm-hmm.

591
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:38,750
- Whee!
- Oh! That tickles!

592
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:42,986
Oh-oh-oh! You!
Whee!

593
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:47,121
Got a match?

594
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:49,222
Cut that...

595
00:42:51,135 --> 00:42:53,933
You dropped your...

596
00:42:55,372 --> 00:43:00,639
Oh! Hey, you've gotta give me
a little while to fix my makeup.

597
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:02,645
Hi, hon.

598
00:43:02,713 --> 00:43:06,149
Oh, hi. I got some checking to do in the
darkroom anyway. I'll just be a minute.

599
00:43:12,856 --> 00:43:15,882
You like it because you can tuck
yourself away at the top of the stairs...

600
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:19,293
and keep an eye on daddy
with all those sexy models.

601
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:35,972
Hey, Gene, you said a minute.

602
00:43:36,046 --> 00:43:40,881
Come on back, baby. All is
forgiven. Here I am, honey.

603
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:43,681
Listen, if we hurry, we can get
this before lunch, all right? Mm-hmm.

604
00:43:43,754 --> 00:43:45,551
Now tilt your head back
the way you had it.

605
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:47,682
Good. Good.

606
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:51,159
Now it's chest high.
High and...

607
00:43:51,228 --> 00:43:53,822
Hold it. Good.

608
00:43:56,066 --> 00:43:57,294
Turn over.

609
00:43:57,368 --> 00:44:00,235
All right.
All right?

610
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,800
Now tilt your head just...

611
00:44:05,876 --> 00:44:10,006
Hey, something smells good. Yeah,
forward to the camera. That's it.

612
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:13,345
I'm no Betty Crocker, but it smells
to me like something's burning.

613
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,917
Now hold it, Tina.
Good.

614
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:20,957
You know, I think you're right.

615
00:44:21,025 --> 00:44:23,425
Now let's try
a complete profile, honey. Yeah.

616
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,985
Say, Chantal, is everything
under control in there?

617
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:30,296
Go ahead,
cross your legs at the ankle.

618
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:33,495
That's it.
Chantal?

619
00:44:35,406 --> 00:44:38,170
Now, honey, sit up
and face the other way.

620
00:44:38,242 --> 00:44:43,612
That's it. Lean on your arms. Good. I know
Chantal's an exotic cook, but isn't that a bit much?

621
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:47,506
What... Chantal!

622
00:44:54,124 --> 00:44:56,456
Shut those doors.

623
00:45:27,925 --> 00:45:32,225
Well, where were you... Mrs. O'Leary,
when your cow started the fire?

624
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:35,527
Fire? Oh, good heavens!
My shrimp!

625
00:45:36,533 --> 00:45:39,900
Uh, I needed some milk
for the cream sauce.

626
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:43,269
- Chocolate milk on shrimp?
- Uh, yes.

627
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:45,274
I'll find us something for lunch.

628
00:45:45,342 --> 00:45:47,867
I'm sorry. Don't worry about
it. And forget about lunch too.

629
00:45:47,945 --> 00:45:51,346
We're gonna do some shooting in the park
this afternoon, and we'll grab a bite there.

630
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:53,474
Say, you'd better get dressed.

631
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:55,541
Anything you say, boss.

632
00:45:57,054 --> 00:45:59,181
Gene?
Huh?

633
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,417
I am sorry.
Oh, forget it.

634
00:46:11,468 --> 00:46:15,268
Seven. Oh, Mrs. Appley,
what a beautiful family.

635
00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:18,934
I told your father weeks ago, when
Mrs. Appley came home from the park...

636
00:46:19,009 --> 00:46:22,911
with that faraway look in her eye,
that our family was expanding.

637
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:27,440
He just pooh-poohed me, but I know
when one of my own sex has known love...

638
00:46:27,518 --> 00:46:29,452
or trouble.

639
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:34,056
I need help, Maman.
Make me a clever woman.

640
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:37,787
You told me once that it takes a
clever woman to make a good marriage,

641
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:39,852
and I want a good marriage.

642
00:46:41,398 --> 00:46:43,866
Help me, Maman.

643
00:46:43,934 --> 00:46:45,959
There, chouchou.

644
00:46:46,036 --> 00:46:50,200
Now, hadn't we better talk
about Tina and Eugene?

645
00:46:50,274 --> 00:46:53,607
Oh-Oh, it's not Tina, not really.
I know that.

646
00:46:53,677 --> 00:46:57,545
Eugene is preoccupied with her,
but it's more his work than Tina.

647
00:46:57,614 --> 00:46:59,548
I think.

648
00:46:59,616 --> 00:47:02,050
He's always complaining
that I find too much for him to do.

649
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:05,247
I... I have to drag him
to go shopping with me.

650
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:08,587
Oh, Maman, in short,
the honeymoon is over.

651
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:11,389
I think Eugene and I
would have been much happier...

652
00:47:11,461 --> 00:47:14,487
if I'd become his mistress
instead of his wife.

653
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:19,696
Possibly. You, however, Chantal, are
not emotionally suited to be a mistress.

654
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:22,534
So you'd better make the best
of being a wife.

655
00:47:22,606 --> 00:47:24,767
Stop treating Eugene like a husband.

656
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:27,140
That's why he's acting like one.

657
00:47:27,211 --> 00:47:30,044
Stop treating my husband
like a husband?

658
00:47:30,113 --> 00:47:35,847
Chouchou, I have a secret for a
truly happy marriage. You have?

659
00:47:35,919 --> 00:47:39,355
Oh, did I hear your father come in?

660
00:47:39,423 --> 00:47:42,586
No. I didn't hear anything.
Please, Maman, go on.

661
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:45,093
I warn you, this is not easy
to accept at first.

662
00:47:45,162 --> 00:47:47,153
You will laugh at me.

663
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:50,598
No. You, it will probably shock.
Maman, tell me.

664
00:47:50,667 --> 00:47:55,104
I must admit that the idea
seems rather bizarre.

665
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:59,336
However, this little book can
help you create a marital paradise.

666
00:47:59,409 --> 00:48:01,536
Read it and let it work for you.

667
00:48:02,746 --> 00:48:05,772
"How to Train Man's Best... Friend"?

668
00:48:05,849 --> 00:48:09,216
Or how to housebreak
friend husband.

669
00:48:20,297 --> 00:48:23,562
M- Maman, you're not serious?

670
00:48:23,634 --> 00:48:25,568
Serious? Oui.

671
00:48:25,636 --> 00:48:28,127
Mischievous? Oui.

672
00:48:28,205 --> 00:48:33,233
If you want a perfect marriage,
treat your husband like a dog.

673
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:35,301
Come, come, cabbage head.

674
00:48:35,379 --> 00:48:38,746
Where's the delicious sense
of mischief you used to have?

675
00:48:38,815 --> 00:48:42,012
Oh, well, if you must know,
I think it's disgusting...

676
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:44,076
treating your husband
like a dog.

677
00:48:44,154 --> 00:48:46,418
Sit down, Joan of Arc.

678
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:50,483
I happen to be very fond of dogs,
but, since you're so sensitive,

679
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,653
I will substitute the word "pet."

680
00:48:52,729 --> 00:48:57,792
Now, a well-trained pet
is not only much happier...

681
00:48:57,868 --> 00:49:00,132
but a much gayer companion.

682
00:49:00,203 --> 00:49:04,537
Personally, I believe that some husbands
are not given the consideration and love...

683
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:06,542
of the average dog.

684
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:09,078
But my husband...
Hello. I'm home.

685
00:49:09,146 --> 00:49:10,875
In the library, darling.

686
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:12,813
Why not just whistle?

687
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:14,874
Enough out of you.

688
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:17,648
It is your marriage
that needs attention, not mine.

689
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:21,851
I've read the book.
Our training period is over.

690
00:50:04,434 --> 00:50:08,894
Charlotte, I only hope you make your
husband as happy as your mother has made me.

691
00:50:08,972 --> 00:50:12,135
I think she will.
The opportunity is hers.

692
00:50:12,209 --> 00:50:15,269
For years, Maman has had me
eating out of the palm of her hand.

693
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:17,279
My pet.

694
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:21,408
Oh! I have to go fix Gene's biscuits...
Dinner.

695
00:50:22,419 --> 00:50:25,911
We're having pork. Heh.
Very good with biscuits.

696
00:50:25,989 --> 00:50:28,219
Chouchou. The book.

697
00:50:30,227 --> 00:50:32,457
I have very little time
for reading, thank you.

698
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:36,056
Some long afternoon
when Gene is occupied with Tina,

699
00:50:36,133 --> 00:50:38,124
perhaps you might
find the time.

700
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:53,516
Gene!

701
00:50:53,583 --> 00:50:55,949
Eugene, I need you.

702
00:50:56,019 --> 00:50:58,920
Here, boy.

703
00:50:58,989 --> 00:51:00,980
Gene!

704
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:15,770
"Calling Your Dog.
It is important to make sure...

705
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:18,933
"your puppy associates the words
'Come' or 'Come here'...

706
00:51:19,009 --> 00:51:21,341
with something
that gives him pleasure."

707
00:51:24,481 --> 00:51:26,711
"When he comes, be sure to pet him.

708
00:51:26,783 --> 00:51:29,809
"Any puppy will be eager
to repeat the act...

709
00:51:29,886 --> 00:51:31,877
that brings with it a reward."

710
00:51:38,528 --> 00:51:42,658
Gene? Darling, could you
come here a minute?

711
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:52,598
Honey, I'm supposed to be the breadwinner
around here. You know how busy I am.

712
00:51:52,676 --> 00:51:57,511
What do you want? This,
honey. I just wanted this.

713
00:51:59,516 --> 00:52:03,179
That all?
Not if you want more.

714
00:52:03,253 --> 00:52:05,448
You little nut. What
are you up to? Nothing.

715
00:52:05,522 --> 00:52:10,118
I'm just hanging a few pictures. I'm sorry I bothered
you. But it did get a little lonesome in here.

716
00:52:10,193 --> 00:52:12,491
It was kind of a nice break.
Honey,

717
00:52:12,562 --> 00:52:15,895
is this all right,
or does this look better?

718
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:18,799
Well, uh, let me hold them,
and you judge.

719
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:27,538
"Remember, praise is very important."

720
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:30,637
So, how's this?
Perfect.

721
00:52:30,714 --> 00:52:34,548
Oh, Eugene, you've gotten them
just right. Here, let me mark them.

722
00:52:37,888 --> 00:52:41,881
Thank you, darling. You don't know what a help
you've been. I could've never done it alone.

723
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:44,449
Anytime. Just whistle.

724
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:49,496
Remember, breadwinner,
you have all that work to do.

725
00:52:49,566 --> 00:52:52,228
Man cannot live by bread alone.

726
00:52:52,302 --> 00:52:54,395
Say, how come you're so much
more beautiful than the rest?

727
00:52:54,471 --> 00:52:57,702
Maman says that if a woman
keeps telling herself,

728
00:52:57,774 --> 00:53:01,073
"I am beautiful.
I am lovely," she will be.

729
00:53:01,144 --> 00:53:04,136
You must talk
to yourself a lot.

730
00:53:12,155 --> 00:53:16,148
You're getting to be an
expert with that door. Mm-hmm.

731
00:53:23,166 --> 00:53:27,660
Go back to sleep. It's Saturday.
The slaves are free.

732
00:53:27,737 --> 00:53:32,401
Free to go down to Bloomingdale's to pick
out material for the new drapes in the studio.

733
00:53:32,475 --> 00:53:35,308
They're having
a yard goods sale.

734
00:53:37,013 --> 00:53:39,641
Come on. Up, slave.
Not today, Charlie.

735
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:44,551
- What did you call me?
- Charlie. Funny, but I like it.

736
00:53:44,621 --> 00:53:47,454
I'm not at all sure I do.

737
00:53:47,524 --> 00:53:51,517
But, anyway,
I'm getting up and so are you.

738
00:53:51,595 --> 00:53:53,927
And I am going in to make coffee.

739
00:53:53,997 --> 00:53:57,660
And when I come back, Eugene,
I expect to find you in that shower.

740
00:53:57,734 --> 00:54:01,761
I'll tell you a secret.
I don't wanna go to Bloomingdale's.

741
00:54:24,394 --> 00:54:27,557
"Your puppy should
never fear the leash.

742
00:54:27,631 --> 00:54:31,795
"But he will if you persist in trying to
drag him unwillingly by the neck.

743
00:54:35,739 --> 00:54:38,572
"At first, let your pet
take you for a walk.

744
00:54:38,642 --> 00:54:40,803
"No matter where he wants to go,
follow him.

745
00:54:40,877 --> 00:54:44,210
"Very soon he will think
going with you is such fun.

746
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:49,446
You will have no difficulty in taking him...
wherever you want to go."

747
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:53,782
Gene.
Mmm?

748
00:54:53,857 --> 00:54:58,021
You're right. This is Saturday,
and you've put in a terrific week's work.

749
00:54:58,094 --> 00:55:03,259
So how's this for service? Breakfast in bed,
followed by lunch and dinner, too, if you like.

750
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:05,301
This is your day.

751
00:55:05,368 --> 00:55:09,327
If you decide you want to get up and go
out, we'll do whatever you want to do.

752
00:55:09,406 --> 00:55:13,069
- You mean it?
- Anyplace. Anytime.

753
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:15,976
You lead, my pet.
I'll follow.

754
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:05,092
Gene.
Mm?

755
00:56:05,161 --> 00:56:07,095
Bloomingdale's is just
one block over.

756
00:56:07,163 --> 00:56:10,655
When you decide which pipe you want, then
we can go pick out our drapery material.

757
00:56:10,734 --> 00:56:13,396
Well, honey, Mr. Ritter and I are
going to work out a new tobacco mixture.

758
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:16,132
Why don't you go on over, and I'll
meet you at home. I'm bushed anyway.

759
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:19,334
Say, let's start with that batch you
made me last summer. It was quite spicy.

760
00:56:19,409 --> 00:56:21,400
Excellent.
I remember.

761
00:56:34,424 --> 00:56:36,449
Hello?

762
00:56:36,526 --> 00:56:38,460
Oh, hello, chouchou.

763
00:56:38,528 --> 00:56:42,862
Oh, I'm glad you're home. We're doing some
fieldwork on the lesson of the leash today.

764
00:56:44,534 --> 00:56:47,867
No, not so good. Well, I've let
him lead me all over creation,

765
00:56:47,937 --> 00:56:50,599
and now "pet" refuses to follow
for just one block.

766
00:56:50,673 --> 00:56:53,164
He won't budge.
What do I do?

767
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:57,236
- The instructions are quite explicit.
- That's fine, but I don't have the book with me.

768
00:56:57,313 --> 00:57:00,248
Chantal, you must commit
each rule to memory...

769
00:57:00,316 --> 00:57:03,683
so you will have the ammunition
at hand as the situations arise.

770
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:06,347
In this case, Rule Seven:

771
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:10,291
"If your puppy refuses to budge,
jerk the leash sharply.

772
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:15,525
"Just enough to get him started.
Once he's headed in the right direction,

773
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:18,590
"slacken the leash immediately...

774
00:57:18,668 --> 00:57:22,160
and praise him lavishly
for coming along with you."

775
00:57:23,339 --> 00:57:26,604
The praise is
the important part, chouchou.

776
00:57:26,676 --> 00:57:28,667
Thank you, Maman.

777
00:57:32,515 --> 00:57:35,678
Here you go. Thank you very much,
Mr. Wright. Pleasant puffing.

778
00:57:35,752 --> 00:57:37,242
Thank you.
All set?

779
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:39,311
Oh, you're still here?
Yes, I'm still here,

780
00:57:39,389 --> 00:57:42,222
and you are coming along
to Bloomingdale's with me.

781
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:46,786
All right. After all, darling,
you are the artist in the family.

782
00:57:46,863 --> 00:57:51,857
I need you. I mean, suppose I picked out something
that would offend your sense of color or design?

783
00:57:51,935 --> 00:57:55,928
Really, Eugene, I am glad you're coming
along with me. You have such fabulous taste.

784
00:57:56,005 --> 00:57:57,939
Well, I picked you, didn't I?

785
00:57:58,007 --> 00:58:00,168
Okay, Charlie,
you take the lead.

786
00:58:07,517 --> 00:58:10,179
Maman, that book has made
a new man of Eugene.

787
00:58:10,253 --> 00:58:14,087
You can't imagine how he's
changed. I call, he comes gladly.

788
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:19,322
We hardly ever argue anymore. I just follow the
rule: "Never lose your temper with your puppy."

789
00:58:19,395 --> 00:58:21,829
Oh. You never lose your temper?
Mm-mm.

790
00:58:21,898 --> 00:58:26,562
- Well, he has changed.
- Of course, I'm careful, like the book says, not to overtrain him.

791
00:58:26,636 --> 00:58:31,630
I frolic with him a part of each day. You know, that's
especially important if your pet is fun-loving by nature.

792
00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:34,176
And mine is extremely fun-loving.

793
00:58:34,244 --> 00:58:38,908
You make living together so much fun
that he really doesn't mind being married.

794
00:58:38,982 --> 00:58:41,883
That's right. I...

795
00:58:41,951 --> 00:58:47,446
I. Oh, Maman,
why didn't you tell me?

796
00:58:48,992 --> 00:58:53,326
Well, Gene hasn't changed at all.
He's exactly the same.

797
00:58:53,396 --> 00:58:56,194
I'm the one who's been in training.
I'm the one who's changed.

798
00:58:56,266 --> 00:58:58,200
Exactly.

799
00:58:58,268 --> 00:59:03,729
The only thing that has changed is the
way you treat your husband... like a dog.

800
00:59:03,806 --> 00:59:06,900
Maman, you are a genius.

801
00:59:06,976 --> 00:59:10,241
For this, we both have
my mother to thank.

802
00:59:10,313 --> 00:59:15,876
She once told me to observe: Husbands
often leave home; pets never do.

803
00:59:15,952 --> 00:59:19,786
There must be a reason. A smart
mother who had a smart mother.

804
00:59:19,856 --> 00:59:23,189
I must say that does give one
a terrific sense of security.

805
00:59:23,259 --> 00:59:26,786
And to think, I used to be worried
about my French and Boston background.

806
00:59:26,863 --> 00:59:31,857
I always thought your combination
perfect... especially for an American.

807
00:59:31,935 --> 00:59:35,098
French in the boudoir.
Boston in the parlor.

808
00:59:35,171 --> 00:59:38,334
But for heaven's sake, chouchou,
never confuse them.

809
01:00:01,531 --> 01:00:06,230
Well, if it isn't Little Red Riding Hood.
How's the wolf situation?

810
01:00:06,302 --> 01:00:09,965
Well, Gene's gone to
Philadelphia for the day. I know.

811
01:00:10,039 --> 01:00:14,305
Oh, rations for Grandma?
No. A puppy from Mrs. Appley.

812
01:00:14,377 --> 01:00:16,470
The kid have an early appointment?

813
01:00:16,546 --> 01:00:19,709
No. It's the puppy's first night
away from his family.

814
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:22,774
The hot water bottle and ticking
alarm clock will keep him company.

815
01:00:22,852 --> 01:00:25,514
You know, the sound of
a heartbeat and the warmth of the body?

816
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:29,789
I must try it.

817
01:00:29,859 --> 01:00:34,523
Tina, how about a nice cup
of hot coffee?

818
01:00:34,597 --> 01:00:37,088
I baked a coconut cake this morning...
with fresh coconut.

819
01:00:37,166 --> 01:00:39,327
No, I can't, baby.
Gene's got me on a diet.

820
01:00:39,402 --> 01:00:42,735
Hmm, you're lucky. You can
turn into a little butterball if you like.

821
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:46,969
Me? He's always pinching
to see if I've gained an ounce.

822
01:00:47,043 --> 01:00:49,739
Butterball?
Oh, I wouldn't worry about it.

823
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:52,975
He likes you just the way you are.

824
01:00:53,049 --> 01:00:56,541
Likes you?
He's unbalanced when it comes to you.

825
01:00:56,619 --> 01:00:59,247
I will have a little scotch
to keep the cold out.

826
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:01,313
Yeah. Sure.

827
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:05,886
W-What do you mean "unbalanced"?
Did he say something?

828
01:01:05,962 --> 01:01:11,025
My dear, he's an absolute bore when it
comes to you. I think you've got him drugged.

829
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:13,762
Oh?

830
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:17,670
I'll have that scotch straight.
What have you been doing with yourself?

831
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:20,573
We don't see much of you
around the studio anymore.

832
01:01:20,643 --> 01:01:23,134
Oh, I've decided Gene should be
left alone while he's working.

833
01:01:23,212 --> 01:01:27,273
I visit Maman.
Do my shopping. Read in the park.

834
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:29,409
To you, Deborah.

835
01:01:29,485 --> 01:01:31,919
In the movies, your part
is always played by Deborah Kerr.

836
01:01:31,988 --> 01:01:36,049
- My part?
- You know, the perfect wife?

837
01:01:37,593 --> 01:01:40,255
Tina, what is wrong
with you today?

838
01:01:40,329 --> 01:01:43,821
Today and every day.
I'll be honest with you, doll.

839
01:01:45,435 --> 01:01:47,903
I'm lonely.

840
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:50,803
Oh. Of course, I have
my very dear friends,

841
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:55,207
the Johnnie Walkers and the
Schenley's and... other scotch types.

842
01:01:57,080 --> 01:02:00,572
Tina, come and sit down
with me for a minute.

843
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:04,313
Oh, that's just the way
Deborah would have said it.

844
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:08,721
With heart. And who am I?

845
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:13,785
Ava Gardner? Yeah.
I'm Ava Gardner.

846
01:02:13,863 --> 01:02:15,854
And what do I do in this scene?

847
01:02:15,932 --> 01:02:19,493
I pour myself another belt.
Do you think you should?

848
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:24,563
Oh, that's a pretty good line too.
Lots of consideration for the other woman.

849
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:27,632
Lots of heart.
That's you, Chantal.

850
01:02:27,710 --> 01:02:30,838
You wanna know something?
You make me sick.

851
01:02:32,381 --> 01:02:35,214
Oh, I didn't mean that.
Honestly, I didn't.

852
01:02:38,688 --> 01:02:42,681
Tina, honey.

853
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:45,250
No cause for alarm.

854
01:02:45,328 --> 01:02:48,161
These aren't real tears.
It's just a little trick I do.

855
01:02:51,167 --> 01:02:54,694
Funny. I used to think
you were such a ninny.

856
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:58,104
Look at you now.
You've got the world, and...

857
01:03:00,843 --> 01:03:03,573
I've got nothing.
Nothing?

858
01:03:03,646 --> 01:03:06,240
You've always had
everything you wanted.

859
01:03:06,315 --> 01:03:08,806
Beauty. Hundreds of admirers.
A rich father.

860
01:03:08,885 --> 01:03:11,376
I don't want hundreds of admirers.
I want a man like Gene.

861
01:03:13,122 --> 01:03:18,059
Oh, no. Not Gene, baby.
Just some nice guy like him.

862
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:20,288
How do you do it?

863
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:25,422
Oh, I don't know
how successful I am at it.

864
01:03:25,501 --> 01:03:27,662
Gene says you have the secret
of keeping a husband happy.

865
01:03:27,737 --> 01:03:30,570
Tell me, what is it?

866
01:03:32,575 --> 01:03:37,410
Oh-Oh, it's nothing really.
Gene shouldn't talk so much.

867
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:40,142
- I'm gonna go get a ginger ale.
- Please, Chantal.

868
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:44,984
Well, it's nothing infallible.

869
01:03:45,054 --> 01:03:49,047
It's an idea... a theory... Maman had.

870
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:52,561
Oh, Tina, I shouldn't be
telling you this. Go ask Maman.

871
01:03:52,628 --> 01:03:54,596
Tell me.

872
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:58,225
Well... I-I don't know how to start.

873
01:03:58,301 --> 01:04:01,566
There's a-a book.

874
01:04:01,637 --> 01:04:05,129
- A book?
- Well, just a little book.

875
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:10,544
Now remember, it's not easy
to see its possibilities... not right away.

876
01:04:10,613 --> 01:04:12,945
In fact, it might even seem ridiculous.

877
01:04:13,015 --> 01:04:15,347
Is that it?

878
01:04:15,418 --> 01:04:18,080
Yes.

879
01:04:19,989 --> 01:04:21,820
Now you must remember,
it isn't easy to...

880
01:04:21,891 --> 01:04:24,382
Well, I tried to prepare you.

881
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:27,861
Believe me, I felt exactly
the same way about it at first.

882
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:30,728
But when you stop to think about it,
a lot of husbands aren't given...

883
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:33,769
the consideration
and love of the average dog.

884
01:04:33,836 --> 01:04:38,830
Well, it's true. Correct training is the
best possible treatment any pet can receive.

885
01:04:38,908 --> 01:04:43,902
Well, husbands are like pets. In the beginning, they
have a hard time learning to live with a stranger.

886
01:04:44,914 --> 01:04:47,508
Tina? Tina?

887
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:57,015
Well, you can at least have the manners not to
laugh at something you obviously don't understand.

888
01:04:57,093 --> 01:05:00,085
Oh, I understand, all right.

889
01:05:00,162 --> 01:05:03,598
I can just see you rolling Gene over
and scratching his tummy.

890
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:06,658
I do not scratch Gene on his tummy.

891
01:05:07,803 --> 01:05:10,101
If I scratch him,
I scratch him behind his ear.

892
01:05:10,172 --> 01:05:13,005
I've seen you do it!

893
01:05:13,075 --> 01:05:15,009
Hello there.

894
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:18,205
Lassie's home. Oh!

895
01:05:19,282 --> 01:05:21,978
Hello there.
Say, didn't I give you the day off?

896
01:05:22,051 --> 01:05:24,952
You did, and have I been
having fun. Hi, honey.

897
01:05:25,021 --> 01:05:26,750
Hi.
Arf! Arf!

898
01:05:26,822 --> 01:05:30,485
Hey. What's the joke? No joke. We
were just having some girl talk.

899
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:35,394
Oh, go on. Tell him, Chantal.
It's kind of a shaggy dog tale.

900
01:05:35,464 --> 01:05:38,297
Yeah, come on. Tell me.
I could use a good laugh.

901
01:05:38,367 --> 01:05:41,996
Oh, I'm afraid Tina's just easily
amused this afternoon. Oh, not at all.

902
01:05:42,071 --> 01:05:44,403
I couldn't have been more depressed
when I arrived.

903
01:05:44,473 --> 01:05:49,467
I thought nothing would make me laugh today,
but Frank Buck over here did the trick.

904
01:05:49,545 --> 01:05:52,480
Speaking of tricks,
you didn't tell me. Does he do any?

905
01:05:52,548 --> 01:05:56,848
Who? Oh! I made a coconut cake
today... with fresh coconut.

906
01:05:56,919 --> 01:06:00,582
I'll get you a piece. Well, I don't think
I want any. Not before dinner anyway.

907
01:06:00,656 --> 01:06:02,988
But I could use a drink.
I worked like a dog today.

908
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:07,558
All right, ladies,
what's so funny?

909
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:12,329
Oh, honey, look. Look what Mrs.
Appley sent us. Isn't he adorable?

910
01:06:12,401 --> 01:06:15,029
- We'll have to name him.
- Eugene II.

911
01:06:16,906 --> 01:06:19,397
- Are you loaded?
- Yes.

912
01:06:19,475 --> 01:06:23,104
But I'm housebroken.
Here, boy.

913
01:06:23,179 --> 01:06:26,512
Don't look now, madam, but your eyes
just crossed. The dog is over there.

914
01:06:26,582 --> 01:06:29,415
Madam knows a dog
when madam sees one.

915
01:06:29,485 --> 01:06:32,215
Madam needs a drink.
Come on, Rover, catch.

916
01:06:33,756 --> 01:06:36,452
I think you've had enough.
Well, how rude.

917
01:06:36,525 --> 01:06:39,961
There must something in this book
about behavior in front of the guests.

918
01:06:40,029 --> 01:06:44,830
Tina, I'd like to give you
a nice cup of hot coffee.

919
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:47,391
And then Gene can
go get you a cab.

920
01:06:47,470 --> 01:06:50,303
I get the message.
About your book, Chantal,

921
01:06:50,373 --> 01:06:53,536
thanks, but, uh, no thanks.

922
01:06:53,609 --> 01:06:56,373
Any fool can see that this is
a great big hunting hound,

923
01:06:56,445 --> 01:06:58,413
and you've turned him
into a little lap dog.

924
01:06:58,481 --> 01:07:01,473
That book can't be too hot, Chantal.

925
01:07:01,550 --> 01:07:04,212
Training shouldn't break
the spirit of the beast.

926
01:07:04,286 --> 01:07:06,447
No thanks to the cab also.

927
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:10,117
"How to Train Man's Best Friend."
Say, what gives with this book?

928
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:12,422
Whose is it?
Maman's.

929
01:07:12,495 --> 01:07:14,793
Oh, she loaned it to you
to train Mrs. Appley's offspring, huh?

930
01:07:14,864 --> 01:07:17,128
Um...

931
01:07:19,301 --> 01:07:23,465
Play it, Deborah. Play it.
Ava has to go.

932
01:07:25,007 --> 01:07:28,238
Just a minute, Tina. There's something
funny going on with this book...

933
01:07:28,310 --> 01:07:30,471
and all those doggy remarks
you've been making.

934
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:33,879
Now why would Chantal give you this book
anyway? You don't have a dog, do you?

935
01:07:33,949 --> 01:07:38,511
- Well, now that you mention it, they do all seem to turn out to be.
- Can't anybody speak so I can understand?

936
01:07:38,587 --> 01:07:42,148
My dear, you must have had a terrible
time with him. He's not very quick.

937
01:07:42,224 --> 01:07:45,022
Good-bye, Tina,
and thanks awfully.

938
01:07:45,094 --> 01:07:47,426
A terrible time doing what?

939
01:07:47,496 --> 01:07:51,091
Why, didn't you know, pet? That's
why you're such a model husband.

940
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:55,001
Because you're so well-trained...
by the rules in that book.

941
01:07:57,006 --> 01:07:59,167
Good-bye, Chantal.

942
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:02,608
And you're welcome... awfully.

943
01:08:06,382 --> 01:08:10,045
"Praise is important.
Remember this in training your pet.

944
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:14,180
"How to make him fetch and carry.
How to make him follow.

945
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:16,850
"How to make the words 'Come here'
mean something pleasurable.

946
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:19,292
"When he comes,

947
01:08:19,361 --> 01:08:21,693
"reward him,

948
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:23,698
scratch him behind the ear."

949
01:08:25,201 --> 01:08:29,297
- How could you do this to me?
- I did it for us... for our marriage.

950
01:08:29,371 --> 01:08:32,363
Oh, when I think of it...
From the day we were married,

951
01:08:32,441 --> 01:08:35,035
you've been training me like a...
like a... -

952
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:40,776
I didn't start the day we were married.
Not for weeks and weeks.

953
01:08:40,850 --> 01:08:45,412
I'm amazed you waited so long. Weren't you
afraid I'd make a mess in front of company?

954
01:08:45,488 --> 01:08:49,254
May I explain, please? Explain?
What is there to explain?

955
01:08:49,325 --> 01:08:52,419
I am not a dog!

956
01:08:54,430 --> 01:08:59,060
Where are you going?
Going out to get some air.

957
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:01,365
Good, I'll take you for a walk.

958
01:09:01,437 --> 01:09:05,874
Oh. I mean... I mean,
I'll go for a walk with you.

959
01:09:05,941 --> 01:09:08,569
I don't know what I mean.

960
01:09:08,644 --> 01:09:13,308
Just burn the leash, Mrs. Wright. I'm perfectly
capable of going out on the town myself.

961
01:09:13,382 --> 01:09:17,876
You know, Tina was right. I am a hunter,
and I still haven't forgotten how to point.

962
01:09:17,953 --> 01:09:20,444
If you don't hear from me,
call the pound.

963
01:09:29,732 --> 01:09:33,395
It's not quite the same, is it, baby?

964
01:09:44,413 --> 01:09:47,246
Is he still angry?
Worse than angry.

965
01:09:47,316 --> 01:09:50,479
Now he's indifferent.
Every minute of the day or night...

966
01:09:50,553 --> 01:09:54,956
he's either taking a picture, about to take a
picture or developing a picture he already took.

967
01:09:55,024 --> 01:09:58,187
It's his business.
And I'm his wife.

968
01:09:58,260 --> 01:10:01,752
A neglected wife. Perhaps it is
time you found yourself a lover.

969
01:10:03,332 --> 01:10:05,596
Tsk. Oh, Maman, how could you
think of such a thing?

970
01:10:05,668 --> 01:10:09,263
I can assure you the idea
did not originate with me.

971
01:10:09,338 --> 01:10:12,273
It is quite an established custom.
In France perhaps.

972
01:10:12,341 --> 01:10:16,107
No, no. They even have them
in Boston. I did.

973
01:10:16,178 --> 01:10:19,341
I can still see him so clearly.

974
01:10:19,415 --> 01:10:22,646
Your father has grown old
with the years, but him, never.

975
01:10:22,718 --> 01:10:25,881
There he stands. Tall, mature.

976
01:10:25,955 --> 01:10:29,618
His thick, black hair
beautifully gray at the temples.

977
01:10:29,692 --> 01:10:33,355
Oh, Maman,
I'm very disappointed.

978
01:10:33,429 --> 01:10:35,920
I love you,
and maybe you had your reasons...

979
01:10:35,998 --> 01:10:38,831
Oh, I did. Your father was annoyed
at me for some little thing.

980
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:43,338
He was ignoring me.
So, I opened the door to Robert Swan.

981
01:10:43,405 --> 01:10:46,897
Well, I just hope Father
never finds out about Robert Swan.

982
01:10:46,976 --> 01:10:49,206
Oh, he knew.
Yes, he knew.

983
01:10:49,278 --> 01:10:53,146
He was so jealous.
Oh, it was marvelous and very amusing.

984
01:10:53,215 --> 01:10:56,309
And just who was
this Robert Swan?

985
01:10:56,385 --> 01:10:59,377
Nobody really.
And Father knew him?

986
01:10:59,455 --> 01:11:01,650
Knew of him. They never met.

987
01:11:01,724 --> 01:11:06,718
Your father is very civilized,
but he never invited my lover to tea.

988
01:11:06,795 --> 01:11:08,763
Maman, don't say that word.

989
01:11:08,831 --> 01:11:10,992
Anyway, I don't believe you.

990
01:11:11,066 --> 01:11:13,398
Ask your father. He's home.

991
01:11:13,469 --> 01:11:16,131
I'm sure he remembers Robert Swan.

992
01:11:17,506 --> 01:11:19,838
Oh, yes.
I knew about him from the start.

993
01:11:19,908 --> 01:11:23,901
It was some years ago when your mother thought
she was being taken a bit too much for granted.

994
01:11:23,979 --> 01:11:27,142
So she invented Robert Swan.

995
01:11:27,216 --> 01:11:29,878
"Invented"?
Yes. He was nobody really.

996
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:32,443
She felt I needed
the stimulus of a lover.

997
01:11:33,455 --> 01:11:36,288
She's not thinking of
reviving him to torment Gene?

998
01:11:36,358 --> 01:11:39,691
Of course.
Of course that's her plan.

999
01:11:39,762 --> 01:11:42,754
How exciting.
Poor Eugene.

1000
01:11:42,831 --> 01:11:46,164
Poor Eugene.
A little competition might revive him.

1001
01:11:46,235 --> 01:11:48,169
Tell me,
how did Maman work it?

1002
01:11:48,237 --> 01:11:52,071
He would call the house, and if I answered,
there'd be a guilty click on the other end.

1003
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:54,041
Oh, the click drove me
out of my mind.

1004
01:11:54,109 --> 01:11:57,010
But if he was nobody,
how-how could he call?

1005
01:11:57,079 --> 01:12:00,242
He couldn't. But any of
your mother's girlfriends could.

1006
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:02,284
You know how you females
plot together.

1007
01:12:02,351 --> 01:12:06,845
- All they had to do was call...
- And if a man answers, hang up.

1008
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:10,158
Has your father cleared my good name?

1009
01:12:10,225 --> 01:12:12,159
Mm-hmm.
It's a delicious idea.

1010
01:12:12,227 --> 01:12:16,220
Maman, do you think
I might borrow your Mr. Swan?

1011
01:12:16,298 --> 01:12:19,563
For a daughter to borrow a mother's lover
is in questionable taste.

1012
01:12:19,635 --> 01:12:21,796
Even in Paris.

1013
01:12:21,870 --> 01:12:26,034
Germaine, if the gentleman never existed,
how could it be in questionable taste?

1014
01:12:26,108 --> 01:12:31,978
That is true, but I pictured him so clearly that I
keep forgetting he existed only in my imagination.

1015
01:12:32,047 --> 01:12:34,709
Very well, chouchou.
Since your father approves...

1016
01:12:34,783 --> 01:12:37,445
I most definitely do not approve.
In fact, I think it's...

1017
01:12:37,519 --> 01:12:40,352
But, my dear, you just said...
What I said was...

1018
01:12:40,422 --> 01:12:44,256
Well, let's forget it. And you,
Charlotte, had best forget Robert Swan.

1019
01:12:44,326 --> 01:12:48,558
- He'd be much too old for you now anyway.
- Not to pick up the phone and dial.

1020
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:51,963
Maybe he had a son.
Bye, Father.

1021
01:12:54,636 --> 01:12:59,164
- Merci. Merci beaucoup, Maman.
- You're welcome, chouchou.

1022
01:13:00,843 --> 01:13:03,676
Isn't it lovely? Even now,
a small part of your father...

1023
01:13:03,746 --> 01:13:06,840
is not completely sure
there was no Robert Swan.

1024
01:13:06,915 --> 01:13:10,248
Maman, you must
call me tonight.

1025
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:14,813
And, if a man answers...
It's the click that drives them mad.

1026
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:17,882
And they say it's the female
who's the curious one. Bye-bye, Maman.

1027
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:19,450
Bye, darling.

1028
01:13:22,464 --> 01:13:25,126
Oh. The roses.
Roses?

1029
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:30,160
On your way home, send yourself two dozen
long-stem roses from the very best florist.

1030
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:35,336
Long-stem. That's very important.
Long-stem roses. Mr. Swan is expensive.

1031
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:40,075
And no card. When Gene wants to
know who sent them, tell him you did.

1032
01:13:40,149 --> 01:13:43,516
Never lie to him.
Now, when ordering the roses,

1033
01:13:43,585 --> 01:13:46,418
pretend you are Mr. Swan's secretary.

1034
01:13:46,488 --> 01:13:51,619
And mention his name often to the
florist, so he will be sure to remember it.

1035
01:13:51,693 --> 01:13:55,185
- Mrs. Stacy, you are a witch.
- Yes.

1036
01:13:57,699 --> 01:13:59,633
Come on. Come on.

1037
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:08,632
Here we are, angel whites.
A rose of rare perfection.

1038
01:14:08,710 --> 01:14:11,543
Well, they're lovely.
You did say 12.50 a dozen?

1039
01:14:11,613 --> 01:14:15,447
Yes. That's right. I don't suppose
he could just send one dozen.

1040
01:14:15,517 --> 01:14:18,884
No. Not Mr. Robert Swan. I-I'm always
trying to economize for my boss.

1041
01:14:18,954 --> 01:14:23,448
I see. And no card. Mr. Swan
was very emphatic about that.

1042
01:14:23,525 --> 01:14:27,518
Mr. Robert Swan is a
very emphatic man. I see.

1043
01:14:27,596 --> 01:14:32,431
In the future, I will be placing Mr. Swan's
order by phone. You will remember when I call?

1044
01:14:32,501 --> 01:14:36,995
Mr. Robert Swan. I shan't
forget. I'm counting on you.

1045
01:14:40,108 --> 01:14:42,042
Now hold it.

1046
01:14:42,110 --> 01:14:45,102
I tell you what, let's try it
one more time, ladies, huh?

1047
01:14:46,114 --> 01:14:49,106
Somehow that one
just didn't quite gel.

1048
01:14:49,184 --> 01:14:53,018
Give me a little venom.
This time, no expression at all.

1049
01:14:59,361 --> 01:15:01,852
Chantal, the doorbell.

1050
01:15:06,668 --> 01:15:08,761
Excuse me, will you?

1051
01:15:10,939 --> 01:15:13,601
Here you go, sport.
Flowers?

1052
01:15:13,675 --> 01:15:16,439
Could be long cigars.

1053
01:15:18,113 --> 01:15:20,741
Flowers.
Uh, what's the occasion, honey?

1054
01:15:20,816 --> 01:15:23,478
Why doesn't my husband
ever remember our anniversary?

1055
01:15:23,552 --> 01:15:27,079
Can't be an anniversary. Not yet.
Must be Chantal's birthday.

1056
01:15:29,324 --> 01:15:34,159
All right, girls. All right. It's
not anything at all. I don't think.

1057
01:15:34,229 --> 01:15:36,459
Chantal, show yourself, girl.

1058
01:15:36,532 --> 01:15:38,397
Come on out, Chantal.
Come out. Come on out.

1059
01:15:38,467 --> 01:15:42,631
You got a surprise.
What's going on here?

1060
01:15:42,704 --> 01:15:45,036
Exactly, Mrs. Wright.
What is going on?

1061
01:15:45,107 --> 01:15:48,668
Uh, flowers for you and not
from your husband. Flowers?

1062
01:15:48,744 --> 01:15:51,804
Or long cigars.

1063
01:15:58,854 --> 01:16:02,654
Oh, they're perfectly beautiful.

1064
01:16:02,724 --> 01:16:05,989
Long-stems. Look at that.
Huh. No card.

1065
01:16:06,061 --> 01:16:09,553
No card?
No card.

1066
01:16:09,631 --> 01:16:12,930
But they are perfectly lovely.
Aren't they, honey? Smell.

1067
01:16:13,001 --> 01:16:16,664
- But there must be a card.
- No.

1068
01:16:25,347 --> 01:16:27,281
Isn't it lucky
we have this vase?

1069
01:16:27,349 --> 01:16:29,840
It'd be such a shame
to cut off these beautiful long stems.

1070
01:16:29,918 --> 01:16:32,318
No card, huh?
No card.

1071
01:16:32,387 --> 01:16:36,380
Odd, wouldn't you say?
No. Not really.

1072
01:16:36,458 --> 01:16:39,950
You see, I sent them. Two dozen,
long-stemmed white roses...

1073
01:16:40,028 --> 01:16:43,520
from a Fifth Avenue florist?
Yes.

1074
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:45,533
Fancy.

1075
01:16:55,877 --> 01:17:00,246
Mm. Those flowers smell of
a summer garden I once knew.

1076
01:17:00,315 --> 01:17:02,374
Those roses smell of something, all right.

1077
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:06,681
Oh.

1078
01:17:07,856 --> 01:17:10,689
I'll answer it.

1079
01:17:14,129 --> 01:17:16,893
Hello. Hello?

1080
01:17:26,808 --> 01:17:29,436
Who was it?
Uh, wrong number.

1081
01:17:29,511 --> 01:17:32,173
I guess.
Oh.

1082
01:17:46,028 --> 01:17:49,520
You're not mad about
that dog book anymore?

1083
01:17:49,598 --> 01:17:51,589
What dog book?

1084
01:18:04,279 --> 01:18:07,271
Hello. Hello?

1085
01:18:07,349 --> 01:18:10,841
Now look, I know you're there
'cause I can hear you breathing.

1086
01:18:19,194 --> 01:18:22,186
Did I hear the phone? You
did. Another wrong number.

1087
01:18:22,264 --> 01:18:24,698
Oh. Probably my mother.
Your mother?

1088
01:18:24,766 --> 01:18:26,700
Now why would your mother call
and then hang up?

1089
01:18:26,768 --> 01:18:29,635
Why don't you ask her? You know she
does such crazy things sometimes.

1090
01:18:31,506 --> 01:18:35,772
You look so beautiful this morning. And
you look like Tarzan in a snow storm.

1091
01:18:35,844 --> 01:18:39,007
Why don't you go finish shaving.
Breakfast is almost ready.

1092
01:18:55,530 --> 01:18:58,363
Yes, I'm Chantal Wright.
Thank you very much.

1093
01:19:10,378 --> 01:19:13,370
Not more roses?
Yes.

1094
01:19:13,448 --> 01:19:15,780
And you sent them?
Yes.

1095
01:19:15,851 --> 01:19:20,686
You know, it looks like Pasadena on New Year's
Day as it is. Now why would you order any more?

1096
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:22,951
Because I like roses.
Obviously.

1097
01:19:23,024 --> 01:19:25,185
Smells like a sachet bag in here.

1098
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:27,524
You know, it's getting so I look
forward to the aroma of the darkroom.

1099
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:31,589
Well, now how can you say that
when they smell so...

1100
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:35,536
sweet.

1101
01:19:43,378 --> 01:19:45,539
All right, Charlie.

1102
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:48,105
It's time we did
some plain talking about those roses.

1103
01:19:48,183 --> 01:19:50,344
There's something
very funny going on here.

1104
01:19:50,418 --> 01:19:53,910
Funny? Are you suggesting that
someone else is sending them?

1105
01:19:53,989 --> 01:19:57,982
Well, now that you mention it, yes.
Oh.

1106
01:19:58,059 --> 01:20:00,550
Charlie, what's the matter?
You all right? What is it?

1107
01:20:00,629 --> 01:20:05,123
Oh, darling, please don't think that. Don't think
that someone else is sending them. Please don't.

1108
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:08,533
Okay, honey. I won't. I won't.
Just don't cry, please. Don't cry?

1109
01:20:10,205 --> 01:20:14,198
I think I should go lie
down for a bit. Yeah. Yeah.

1110
01:20:14,276 --> 01:20:16,210
I'll help you.

1111
01:20:16,278 --> 01:20:18,439
I'll help you.
Oh. Ohh.

1112
01:20:20,682 --> 01:20:23,344
Okay. Okay.

1113
01:20:23,418 --> 01:20:27,912
Oh. I forgot to put the roses in water.
You will take of them for me, won't you?

1114
01:20:27,989 --> 01:20:29,547
Gladly.

1115
01:20:31,193 --> 01:20:33,354
Okay. Okay.

1116
01:20:41,369 --> 01:20:45,863
Hello. Hello?

1117
01:20:47,442 --> 01:20:49,808
He hung up again.

1118
01:20:49,878 --> 01:20:52,472
I'm sure it's Maman.

1119
01:20:52,547 --> 01:20:55,880
Oh, no, Charlie. You know
what it sounds like to me?

1120
01:20:55,951 --> 01:20:58,078
No. What does it sound like to you?

1121
01:20:58,153 --> 01:21:00,781
It sounds like if a man answers, hang up.

1122
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:03,416
And just what are you implying?

1123
01:21:03,491 --> 01:21:07,291
I am not implying anything.
I am saying it quite plainly.

1124
01:21:09,664 --> 01:21:13,498
Okay. All right.
Forget about it.

1125
01:21:13,568 --> 01:21:16,401
We'll talk about it later, honey,
when you're feeling better.

1126
01:21:16,471 --> 01:21:18,962
If you doubt my love,
I'll never feel any better.

1127
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:23,534
Oh, no, baby. I love you.
All I want is your love.

1128
01:21:23,612 --> 01:21:26,809
And that's all I want, Gene.
Honestly.

1129
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:31,376
No more white roses?
No more white roses.

1130
01:21:33,555 --> 01:21:35,682
From now on,
I'll send gladiolas.

1131
01:21:38,493 --> 01:21:40,927
Well, should I change
the color too, honey?

1132
01:21:40,996 --> 01:21:43,658
That's up to you.

1133
01:21:43,732 --> 01:21:48,066
Now, if you'll forgive me, I have
some work to do in my darkroom.

1134
01:22:03,118 --> 01:22:05,109
Hello.

1135
01:22:07,122 --> 01:22:11,115
It did? Oh, yes.

1136
01:22:11,192 --> 01:22:14,889
Well, my. Yes, yes.
You did exactly right, chouchou.

1137
01:22:14,963 --> 01:22:17,124
Soon it will all be over.

1138
01:22:17,198 --> 01:22:20,759
The irate husband will pay a call
on the Fifth Avenue florist,

1139
01:22:20,835 --> 01:22:24,601
bribe the name of Robert Swan
out of the salesman, come home...

1140
01:22:24,673 --> 01:22:27,005
and confront you with
the name of your lover...

1141
01:22:27,075 --> 01:22:31,239
and make you promise never to see
or hear from Robert Swan again.

1142
01:22:31,313 --> 01:22:34,146
You will tell him the truth.
That there is no such man.

1143
01:22:34,215 --> 01:22:36,376
He, of course,
will not believe you.

1144
01:22:36,451 --> 01:22:40,046
But that will be the last
of Mr. Swan, and all will be happy.

1145
01:22:40,121 --> 01:22:43,648
Good. Those roses cost me
my new winter coat.

1146
01:22:43,725 --> 01:22:46,717
You will have your love
to keep you warm.

1147
01:22:47,829 --> 01:22:50,320
Good-bye, chouchou.
Bye-bye, Maman.

1148
01:23:00,542 --> 01:23:04,273
Whew! Oh!
Sorry.

1149
01:23:04,346 --> 01:23:06,610
Where have you been?
Radio City Music Hall.

1150
01:23:06,681 --> 01:23:09,844
- Until 8:00 at night?
- Dinner won't take but a minute to heat up, honey.

1151
01:23:09,918 --> 01:23:13,183
I hope you don't mind. We're having
leftovers. I didn't have time to shop.

1152
01:23:13,254 --> 01:23:17,247
Some more roses came for you while
you were at Radio City Music Hall.

1153
01:23:17,325 --> 01:23:20,317
Oh, I'm sure not.
I ordered gladiolas.

1154
01:23:20,395 --> 01:23:23,728
Pink. You seemed so tired of white.

1155
01:23:23,798 --> 01:23:28,963
Mm-hmm. Gladiolas. Or is it
gladioli? Anyway, they're pink.

1156
01:23:29,037 --> 01:23:32,131
Chantal, there's no need
for any more lies between us.

1157
01:23:32,207 --> 01:23:35,040
I know all about Robert Swan.

1158
01:23:35,110 --> 01:23:38,273
I paid a little visit to the florist
this afternoon... and I do mean "paid."

1159
01:23:38,346 --> 01:23:40,940
So let's be honest
with each other for a change, huh?

1160
01:23:41,016 --> 01:23:46,010
But, darling, I have never been anything
but honest with you. There is no Robert Swan.

1161
01:23:46,087 --> 01:23:49,579
He is a figment of Maman's imagination
that I borrowed to make you jealous...

1162
01:23:49,657 --> 01:23:53,753
because I thought you were neglecting me
because I made you mad treating you like a dog.

1163
01:23:53,828 --> 01:23:58,993
Honey, it's all perfectly true. And,
furthermore, I sent and paid for those roses.

1164
01:23:59,067 --> 01:24:03,436
- Oh, boy, did I pay for those roses.
- Please, Chantal, don't go on, huh?

1165
01:24:03,505 --> 01:24:08,169
Look, if you've fallen for
someone else, I can't stand in your way.

1166
01:24:09,477 --> 01:24:13,413
Things like this do happen, you know. I never thought
it could happen to us. A guy's gotta be realistic.

1167
01:24:13,481 --> 01:24:16,644
When a thing is over, it's over.
Now wait a minute.

1168
01:24:16,718 --> 01:24:19,380
Why? I love you, and you love
him. It's as simple as that.

1169
01:24:19,454 --> 01:24:23,788
Don't you want me to give him up?
What kind of heel do you think I am?

1170
01:24:23,858 --> 01:24:26,349
I have no right to ask you
to give up the man you love.

1171
01:24:26,428 --> 01:24:29,761
No right? You're my husband.
Of course you have a right.

1172
01:24:29,831 --> 01:24:32,322
Great Scott, man,
fight for me. I...

1173
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:36,063
What am I saying?
Eugene, there is no one to fight with.

1174
01:24:36,137 --> 01:24:40,631
That's what gets me. I can't understand why
you keep denying it. Are you trying to save me?

1175
01:24:40,708 --> 01:24:43,370
Darling, sit down.

1176
01:24:43,445 --> 01:24:45,606
Just sit down, Eugene.

1177
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:50,014
Now, look, you're imagining all this
because I wanted you to.

1178
01:24:50,085 --> 01:24:52,076
I wanted you to
think the the worst of me.

1179
01:24:52,153 --> 01:24:56,317
Well, then why do you keep telling me it's Maman
on the phone and that you sent yourself the flowers?

1180
01:24:56,391 --> 01:24:58,882
Because I knew
you wouldn't believe me.

1181
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:01,622
It's the truth, but it sounds like
a bunch of lies.

1182
01:25:01,696 --> 01:25:04,859
So by telling you the truth,
you'd think I was lying and then I...

1183
01:25:04,933 --> 01:25:08,027
Now you've really got me
mixed up, and it's so simple, Eugene!

1184
01:25:08,103 --> 01:25:13,541
Poor Charlie, I-I know. You just don't wanna
hurt me. What's this Swan fellow like anyway?

1185
01:25:13,608 --> 01:25:16,202
I hope he's a great guy.
I'd hate to give you up to just anybody.

1186
01:25:16,277 --> 01:25:19,440
He's not married, is he?
He's not anything!

1187
01:25:19,514 --> 01:25:21,846
He's just not, that's what he is!
He isn't!

1188
01:25:23,251 --> 01:25:28,245
Eugene, I haven't been feeling well this
week, and I can't go on with this anymore.

1189
01:25:28,323 --> 01:25:30,257
I really can't.

1190
01:25:30,325 --> 01:25:33,658
So you just go fix yourself
a drink, and I'll get dinner.

1191
01:25:33,728 --> 01:25:36,720
And after dinner, we'll go over
to Washington Square,

1192
01:25:36,798 --> 01:25:40,461
and Maman and Father
will explain away Robert Swan.

1193
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:49,035
Th-That'll be Maman calling now.
Don't give her a chance to hang up.

1194
01:25:49,110 --> 01:25:52,705
Tell her you know who it is, and that,
after dinner, we'll be over for a brandy.

1195
01:25:52,780 --> 01:25:55,943
Eugene, answer it!

1196
01:25:56,017 --> 01:25:59,418
Hello. I know who this is. Mr. Swan,
if you're man enough for my wife,

1197
01:25:59,487 --> 01:26:02,217
I would think you'd be
man enough to speak up.

1198
01:26:02,290 --> 01:26:05,885
That's better. Yeah. She's standing right
here. Would you like to speak to her?

1199
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:08,793
Oh, I see. No.
No, I wouldn't mind that at all.

1200
01:26:08,863 --> 01:26:10,854
In fact, that would be
most agreeable with me.

1201
01:26:10,932 --> 01:26:14,595
After all, I'm sure the only thing we're
both interested in is Chantal's happiness.

1202
01:26:15,737 --> 01:26:18,228
I'm glad to hear you say that.
Splendid.

1203
01:26:18,306 --> 01:26:22,470
I'm glad to hear that.
Good-bye, Mr. Swan. He'll be right over.

1204
01:26:22,544 --> 01:26:25,877
I'm gonna have that drink. Oh, and
you'd better set the table for three...

1205
01:26:25,947 --> 01:26:28,279
in case he decides to
join us for dinner.

1206
01:26:28,349 --> 01:26:30,340
Too bad it's only leftovers.

1207
01:26:55,577 --> 01:26:58,740
Hadn't you better answer it?
I mean, after all, he is your friend.

1208
01:26:58,813 --> 01:27:01,304
I can't. I really can't.

1209
01:27:01,382 --> 01:27:04,874
Oh, Gene, honestly! This is ridiculous.
Of course it is. Of course it is.

1210
01:27:04,953 --> 01:27:07,945
We're civilized people. There's no
reason why the three of us shouldn't meet,

1211
01:27:08,022 --> 01:27:11,856
sit down
and talk this whole thing over, hmm?

1212
01:27:19,934 --> 01:27:22,835
Good evening, Chantal.

1213
01:27:24,339 --> 01:27:26,273
Robert Swan.
Eugene Wright.

1214
01:27:26,341 --> 01:27:28,832
I'm very glad that you decided to
come out of hiding, Mr. Swan.

1215
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:32,903
I wanted to face you without problem
sometime ago, Mr. Wright, but, uh, Chantal...

1216
01:27:32,981 --> 01:27:36,417
I never saw that man
before in my life! Darling.

1217
01:27:36,484 --> 01:27:39,078
Please, Chantal,
Mr. Swan came here to talk.

1218
01:27:39,153 --> 01:27:43,783
- I told you he was coming.
- Yes, I know. But never in my wildest dreams...

1219
01:27:43,858 --> 01:27:48,192
- and this is the wildest ever...
di-did I expect him to show up.

1220
01:27:48,263 --> 01:27:50,197
Oh?

1221
01:27:51,232 --> 01:27:53,166
Well, then why is
the table set for three?

1222
01:27:53,234 --> 01:27:55,464
Come on, now, Charlie.
Don't be rude. Shut the door.

1223
01:27:55,536 --> 01:27:58,403
Won't you sit down, Mr. Swan?
I'll take your coat. Thank you.

1224
01:27:58,473 --> 01:28:01,806
Would you, uh, care for something
to drink? Well, thank you. Yes.

1225
01:28:01,876 --> 01:28:05,744
Scotch with a splash of soda.
You got it.

1226
01:28:07,081 --> 01:28:08,981
What an attractive place
you have here.

1227
01:28:09,050 --> 01:28:12,747
- Oh, you've never been here before?
- Come now, of course not.

1228
01:28:12,820 --> 01:28:15,118
Well, I am gone a lot.

1229
01:28:19,961 --> 01:28:24,091
Yes, yes.
A most comfortable apartment.

1230
01:28:24,165 --> 01:28:27,157
You'll find that Chantal is quite a
homemaker as well as being a great cook.

1231
01:28:27,235 --> 01:28:30,227
French cooking, mostly. A bit free
with the butter, but very tasty.

1232
01:28:30,305 --> 01:28:32,000
Her mother's French, you know.

1233
01:28:32,073 --> 01:28:34,234
Yes, also very free with the butter.

1234
01:28:34,309 --> 01:28:37,642
I knew her mother quite well
some time ago in Boston.

1235
01:28:37,712 --> 01:28:40,044
Fabulous woman.
Oh, fabulous.

1236
01:28:40,114 --> 01:28:43,174
The daughter is not the mother,
but charming. Ooh, charming.

1237
01:28:51,859 --> 01:28:55,192
Mmm. This is delicious. Mind
you, these are just leftovers.

1238
01:28:55,263 --> 01:28:58,596
I feel guilty stealing such
a good cook away from you, Gene.

1239
01:28:58,666 --> 01:29:01,658
Oh, that's the least of it, Bob.
Say, how about some more broccoli?

1240
01:29:01,736 --> 01:29:04,728
Oh, thank you. Yes. What do
you mean "the least of it"?

1241
01:29:04,806 --> 01:29:08,469
Charlie, he obviously doesn't realize
that you are an artist in an apron.

1242
01:29:08,543 --> 01:29:11,239
What he meant was,
I have other talents.

1243
01:29:11,312 --> 01:29:13,712
I know, Charlie. I know.

1244
01:29:13,781 --> 01:29:17,308
You don't know any such thing,
and don't call me Charlie!

1245
01:29:17,385 --> 01:29:21,048
Honey, please. You're
right. Enough is enough.

1246
01:29:21,122 --> 01:29:24,956
I can't pretend any longer.
I love her, and I won't give her up.

1247
01:29:25,026 --> 01:29:27,187
I... I love her,
and I won't give her up.

1248
01:29:27,261 --> 01:29:31,254
Well, in that case, there's just one
thing to do. Sit down. I had a thought.

1249
01:29:31,332 --> 01:29:33,493
Coffee.
Cream and two sugars, please.

1250
01:29:33,568 --> 01:29:37,470
I had a thought. A bit unconventional maybe, but the heck
with the neighbors. Besides which, if it gets too bad...

1251
01:29:37,538 --> 01:29:39,699
we can always move
to Greenwich Village.

1252
01:29:39,774 --> 01:29:43,642
I've been sitting here thinking, there's no reason
why the three of us couldn't get along together.

1253
01:29:43,711 --> 01:29:47,044
After all, you and I hit it off
famously, right, Bob? Famously, Gene.

1254
01:29:47,115 --> 01:29:50,278
And Chantal here is half-French.

1255
01:29:58,292 --> 01:30:00,692
The Boston half
is very often two-thirds.

1256
01:30:00,762 --> 01:30:04,425
Maman, sit down.
Just sit down.

1257
01:30:04,499 --> 01:30:08,663
You won't believe this,
but Mr. Swan is here. Robert Swan!

1258
01:30:09,904 --> 01:30:13,533
Now, now, chérie,
have you been having dizzy spells?

1259
01:30:13,608 --> 01:30:18,272
- You should see the doctor.
- I cooked dinner for him, and he ate it.

1260
01:30:18,346 --> 01:30:21,509
Now, hallucinations don't clean up
their plates and ask for seconds.

1261
01:30:21,582 --> 01:30:25,245
He's in there right now
with Eugene laughing it up.

1262
01:30:25,319 --> 01:30:27,810
Oh, they get along famously.

1263
01:30:27,889 --> 01:30:30,983
As a matter of fact, Mr. Wright has
invited Mr. Swan to move in here.

1264
01:30:31,058 --> 01:30:34,960
You call the doctor.
He will give you something to soothe you.

1265
01:30:35,029 --> 01:30:39,659
Your father and I will be
right over as soon as we finish our dinner.

1266
01:30:39,734 --> 01:30:43,226
Now, chouchou, you close your eyes,
he'll go away.

1267
01:30:43,304 --> 01:30:48,708
- Is Charlotte ill?
- No, no. I'm afraid our little girl had a soupçon too much wine.

1268
01:30:48,776 --> 01:30:52,109
Robert Swan has joined them for dinner.

1269
01:30:54,449 --> 01:30:57,612
He has?

1270
01:30:57,685 --> 01:31:02,384
Well, if he's with them now,
he was with you in Boston years ago.

1271
01:31:02,457 --> 01:31:07,360
Oh, John. Really. Chantal must be
pregnant and a little light-headed.

1272
01:31:07,428 --> 01:31:09,589
What's your excuse?

1273
01:31:09,664 --> 01:31:12,827
Oh, come on. There is some
chocolate mousse for dessert.

1274
01:31:17,505 --> 01:31:20,668
Go away.

1275
01:31:20,741 --> 01:31:22,902
Chouchou, it's Maman.

1276
01:31:22,977 --> 01:31:26,469
Charlotte, what's the matter?
Why is this door locked?

1277
01:31:26,547 --> 01:31:29,311
To keep them out.
To keep whom out?

1278
01:31:29,383 --> 01:31:33,114
There's no one out there.
No one? But...

1279
01:31:33,187 --> 01:31:36,679
The front door was wide open,
so we just walked in.

1280
01:31:36,757 --> 01:31:38,918
Perhaps Eugene has
gone for the doctor.

1281
01:31:38,993 --> 01:31:43,828
Doctor? Now, why would he go for a doctor? No.
I tell you, he went someplace with Mr. Swan.

1282
01:31:43,898 --> 01:31:45,889
Chantal, stop saying that.

1283
01:31:45,967 --> 01:31:48,800
Robert Swan was in this apartment
tonight. See for yourselves.

1284
01:31:48,870 --> 01:31:52,135
The three of us had dinner
right here...

1285
01:31:54,442 --> 01:31:57,605
They've cleared everything away.

1286
01:31:57,678 --> 01:31:59,942
Well, you can count
the dirty dishes in the kitchen.

1287
01:32:01,449 --> 01:32:03,815
I tell you there were three of us.

1288
01:32:07,255 --> 01:32:11,089
See? See, I told you.
This proves someone else was here.

1289
01:32:11,158 --> 01:32:15,925
Oh, my poor little cabbage head. What do you
imagine now? There's not a dirty dish... nothing.

1290
01:32:15,997 --> 01:32:20,661
Exactly. That's what I'm saying.
Someone else had to be here with Eugene.

1291
01:32:20,735 --> 01:32:24,728
He doesn't know dishes are for washing. Oh,
sure, he knows there's a sink in the kitchen,

1292
01:32:24,805 --> 01:32:27,433
but he isn't sure
just what it's for.

1293
01:32:27,508 --> 01:32:31,410
Charlotte, I think you should take
two aspirin with a large glass of water.

1294
01:32:31,479 --> 01:32:33,572
Hello? Where is everybody?

1295
01:32:33,648 --> 01:32:36,640
Oh, they're back.

1296
01:32:36,717 --> 01:32:40,380
Hi, Charlie. John, nice to see you.
Maman.

1297
01:32:40,454 --> 01:32:41,853
Where is he?
What, honey?

1298
01:32:41,923 --> 01:32:44,983
Where is he! Don't
fret. Here I am, my dear.

1299
01:32:45,059 --> 01:32:48,654
I simply do not believe in rushing the
stairs like some young fools that I...

1300
01:32:50,097 --> 01:32:51,496
Germaine.

1301
01:32:55,169 --> 01:32:58,969
It is Germaine.

1302
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:00,974
Germaine.

1303
01:33:07,315 --> 01:33:09,408
You see, I haven't forgotten.

1304
01:33:09,483 --> 01:33:11,974
Who are you?

1305
01:33:12,053 --> 01:33:17,047
Have I changed that much? And you,
Germaine, are just as beautiful as ever.

1306
01:33:17,124 --> 01:33:20,059
It's Robert Swan.
Your Robert Swan.

1307
01:33:20,127 --> 01:33:22,459
You are not my Robert Swan.

1308
01:33:22,530 --> 01:33:25,260
I would never dream up a lover
with-with a moustache!

1309
01:33:25,333 --> 01:33:29,997
I say, Bob, I'm gonna take these things and put 'em
in the bedroom. We can work out the details later.

1310
01:33:30,071 --> 01:33:33,905
- Details?
- This is Robert Swan?

1311
01:33:33,975 --> 01:33:36,967
Of course not.
Chantal, explain this at once.

1312
01:33:37,044 --> 01:33:39,308
You have no right to cause trouble
between your father and me.

1313
01:33:39,380 --> 01:33:43,214
He's your idea. You dreamed him up.
You make him go away.

1314
01:33:43,284 --> 01:33:46,447
At last, I meet Germaine's husband.

1315
01:33:50,958 --> 01:33:53,620
Oh, oh, oh. Must you go?

1316
01:33:53,694 --> 01:33:57,027
I know things will never be the
same for us, but we could reminisce.

1317
01:33:57,098 --> 01:34:00,431
Those meetings in the Common.
The little out-of-the-way restaurants.

1318
01:34:00,501 --> 01:34:03,493
What are you?
Some kind of a crazy?

1319
01:34:03,571 --> 01:34:05,402
Maman, wait!
I'm going with you.

1320
01:34:05,473 --> 01:34:08,772
You're not leaving me here
with these... sharecroppers.

1321
01:34:08,843 --> 01:34:11,812
I'm not tossing with them
for the couch.

1322
01:34:13,981 --> 01:34:15,972
Maman, will you talk
some sense into your daughter?

1323
01:34:16,050 --> 01:34:18,109
After all, situations like this
do have their advantages.

1324
01:34:18,185 --> 01:34:21,177
Many a woman would envy
her position, eh, Germaine?

1325
01:34:23,190 --> 01:34:26,626
Are you sure this man
is not of your doing?

1326
01:34:26,694 --> 01:34:29,094
I have never set eyes
on that man before tonight.

1327
01:34:29,163 --> 01:34:32,155
And now, suddenly, his pants
are all but hung in my closet.

1328
01:34:32,233 --> 01:34:36,226
It is obvious that Mr. Swan intends
to make himself very much at home.

1329
01:34:36,303 --> 01:34:39,636
His pants in your closet.
His pictures on your wall.

1330
01:34:39,707 --> 01:34:43,905
His pictures? Well, just
this one to start with.

1331
01:34:43,978 --> 01:34:49,245
It's me.
Yes. Practically all of you.

1332
01:34:49,316 --> 01:34:54,151
His pictures. His paintings!

1333
01:34:54,221 --> 01:34:58,555
"A.W." A... W.

1334
01:34:58,626 --> 01:35:03,563
What is it, chouchou? And Gene told me
he was gonna send him our wedding picture.

1335
01:35:03,631 --> 01:35:07,123
This is most certainly not
your wedding picture.

1336
01:35:07,201 --> 01:35:11,001
What are you jumping around for?
A.W. Oh, Maman, don't you see?

1337
01:35:11,072 --> 01:35:15,566
A.W. Look, there it is again.
A. W... Adam Wright.

1338
01:35:15,643 --> 01:35:20,808
That is Eugene's father out there.
Robert Swan is Adam Wright.

1339
01:35:20,881 --> 01:35:24,214
That is a dirty old man?

1340
01:35:24,285 --> 01:35:28,312
I should've guessed when he
tried to pinch me. Gene's father.

1341
01:35:28,389 --> 01:35:33,224
Oh, that's very amusing.
And he's very attractive.

1342
01:35:33,294 --> 01:35:36,422
I must get home
and explain the joke to your father.

1343
01:35:37,832 --> 01:35:39,766
What are you planning?

1344
01:35:39,834 --> 01:35:43,326
A little hell
to make those two devils feel at home.

1345
01:35:45,673 --> 01:35:47,834
I still want you to
see the doctor.

1346
01:35:47,908 --> 01:35:50,900
It was not the long-stemmed roses
that made you dizzy.

1347
01:35:50,978 --> 01:35:53,811
Do you think... I know.
But let the doctor tell you.

1348
01:35:53,881 --> 01:35:57,681
It gives them such pleasure.

1349
01:36:05,359 --> 01:36:07,884
Oh, what exciting music
men make when they laugh.

1350
01:36:07,962 --> 01:36:11,125
May I have my things, please?

1351
01:36:13,801 --> 01:36:17,567
Must you go?
Yes. I must.

1352
01:36:26,580 --> 01:36:30,482
How could I have forgotten...
that moustache.

1353
01:36:33,420 --> 01:36:35,581
Adam.

1354
01:36:35,656 --> 01:36:39,922
And Eve. Maman and Mr. Swan,
they're a regular Adam and Eve.

1355
01:36:39,994 --> 01:36:44,055
- An ancient Adam and Eve.
- Not so ancient. The word, I believe, is vintaged.

1356
01:36:45,966 --> 01:36:48,799
Heads or tails?

1357
01:36:48,869 --> 01:36:52,600
Well, while you boys make up your minds,
I'll just slip into something more...

1358
01:36:56,944 --> 01:36:58,935
Down, Dad.

1359
01:37:07,454 --> 01:37:09,615
Taxi, lady?

1360
01:37:09,690 --> 01:37:13,126
Oh, thank heavens, darling.
You're still here.

1361
01:37:13,194 --> 01:37:17,358
Listen, you will never guess
who Robert Swan really is?

1362
01:37:17,431 --> 01:37:20,923
Adam Wright.
You knew?

1363
01:37:21,001 --> 01:37:25,836
Gene also knew everything from the
very beginning. We, uh, discussed it.

1364
01:37:25,906 --> 01:37:29,899
Well, you were loyal to your sex.

1365
01:37:29,977 --> 01:37:32,138
I accept defeat gracefully.

1366
01:37:33,147 --> 01:37:35,479
John?
Hmm?

1367
01:37:35,549 --> 01:37:38,541
Has it occurred to you that
the reason I was so flabbergasted...

1368
01:37:38,619 --> 01:37:41,782
was not because
you confronted me with Robert Swan,

1369
01:37:41,856 --> 01:37:45,348
but because it was
the wrong Robert Swan.

1370
01:37:58,873 --> 01:38:01,535
Tails. You win, Adam.

1371
01:38:03,711 --> 01:38:07,238
I'm sure you have some work to do in
the darkroom. I most certainly do not.

1372
01:38:07,314 --> 01:38:09,646
Then show
some initiative, man, and...

1373
01:38:09,717 --> 01:38:11,651
"Adam"?

1374
01:38:14,822 --> 01:38:18,485
Mr. Wright, Sr., sir,
you have won the bed.

1375
01:38:18,559 --> 01:38:21,460
And you, Mr. Wright "Rat" Jr.,
are left with the couch.

1376
01:38:23,931 --> 01:38:28,425
Charlie, look... May I remind you that
New York is full of great restaurants,

1377
01:38:28,502 --> 01:38:30,436
very few of which
serve peanut butter.

1378
01:38:30,504 --> 01:38:34,668
Also, for a dollar and a half an hour,
the dishes will... psst!...disappear.

1379
01:38:34,742 --> 01:38:39,202
And as for companionship, I sincerely hope
you've kept that little black book up-to-date.

1380
01:38:40,948 --> 01:38:46,386
Oh! Get the door for me, will you,
junior? You're so good with doors.

1381
01:40:21,782 --> 01:40:25,616
- Never laugh at your pet.
- Come here.

1382
01:40:25,686 --> 01:40:29,349
Always make the words "come here"
mean something pleasurable.

1383
01:40:32,226 --> 01:40:34,558
Come here.

1384
01:40:38,232 --> 01:40:41,224
You know something, pet?
What?

1385
01:40:41,301 --> 01:40:44,134
I never hear
that old foghorn anymore.

1386
01:40:53,547 --> 01:40:55,481
Come here, little mother.

1387
01:40:55,549 --> 01:40:58,211
How did you know?

1388
01:40:58,285 --> 01:41:01,618
Well, this ain't no movie
where old dad is the last to find out.

1389
01:41:01,688 --> 01:41:05,351
Besides which,
I was at the...

1390
01:41:12,332 --> 01:41:17,401
Hello.
Hello.

1391
01:41:17,471 --> 01:41:19,632
Probably Maman.

1392
01:41:19,706 --> 01:41:22,038
Probably Chantal.
Oh.
