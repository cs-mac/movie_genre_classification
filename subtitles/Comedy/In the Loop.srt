1
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,679
Good morning,
my little chicks and cocks.

2
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,631
Malcolm, monitoring... All the usual.

3
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,035
How did your team do at the weekend?

4
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,754
- All right, yeah, we won.
- Wanker.

5
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,758
Sam, morning. How are you?

6
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,952
Well, pop-pickers,
what disc shall we start with today?

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,389
Wonky Ron
or how about Simon Foster?

8
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,432
On the Eddie Mair
PM programme on the BBC.

9
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,120
<i>Well, I'm joined by Simon Foster,</i>

10
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,435
<i>the Minister
for International Development.</i>

11
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,437
<i>You've been in the job for 18 months.</i>

12
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,391
<i>Do you think you're making headway?</i>

13
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,317
<i>Yes, I do.</i>

14
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,034
<i>You'd expect me to say that, I suppose.</i>

15
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,598
<i>Mark.</i>

16
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,280
You're co-ordinating
the Millennium Goals press release?

17
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,118
Co-ordinate it better, please.

18
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,071
Is that the minister?

19
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,428
OK.

20
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,397
Have we heard anything from Malcolm
about last night's interview?

21
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,351
No, not yet.

22
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,517
- Perhaps he didn't hear it.
- Or maybe he's dead.

23
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,119
He might be dead!

24
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,516
He might have finally had that
massive stroke he's been heading for.

25
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,710
It's been in the fucking post.

26
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,719
<i>Preventable sickness in many of the
poorest countries around the world.</i>

27
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,956
<i>And of course,
the big one is diarrhoea...</i>

28
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,755
Ah, diarrhoea. This is the Minister
for International Development.

29
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,871
He should be talking about
food parcels,

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,150
not fucking arse-spraying mayhem.

31
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,431
<i>So if we can tackle the easy things
like diarrhoea, then we can...</i>

32
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,790
Oh, say it again. Yes, very good.

33
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,831
What is this, the shitting forecast?

34
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,837
<i>... hopefully that will strike another blow</i>

35
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,791
<i>in the war against
preventable diseases.</i>

36
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,717
<i>- You mentioned the word "war".
- Steady, Eddie.</i>

37
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,592
<i>Against preventable diseases.</i>

38
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,950
<i>All the evidence now points to</i>

39
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,277
<i>a US military intervention
in the Middle East.</i>

40
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,277
<i>Is that your view?</i>

41
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,870
<i>Well, personally,
I think that war is unforeseeable.</i>

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,433
Sam. Sam!

43
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,073
<i>- Unforeseeable?
- Yes.</i>

44
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,919
No, you do not think that!

45
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,031
Sam, I'm going to have to go

46
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,630
to International Development
to pull Simon Foster's fucking hair.

47
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,591
He did not say "unforeseeable".

48
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,553
You may have heard him say that,
but he did not say that.

49
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,079
And that is a fact.

50
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,031
Now, he's gonna want you to row back

51
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,879
on that "unforeseeable" thing
on Question Time tonight.

52
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,879
On Question Time, you know the funny
question they always have at the end?

53
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,194
Yes.

54
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,151
I think we should prep that now.

55
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,510
Cos I'd like to shine on
the funny question.

56
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,756
I'm a funny guy, with a light touch.

57
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,031
There's this guy, he's a property
tycoon. He bought a South Sea island.

58
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,152
It might be something like that.
If you had to spend the rest of your life

59
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,635
on a desert island with someone,
who would it be with?

60
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,274
Well... I can't say my wife
cos I haven't got one.

61
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,836
I can't say my girlfriend, because
I haven't got one of those either.

62
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:09,589
- And don't say Mandela. That's...
- No, no, boring. And a bloke.

63
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,119
Or Keira Knightley.

64
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,231
That's a good idea.

65
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,874
Pervert. Sex. Minister.
People don't want to know.

66
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,433
I don't think so.

67
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,596
Did you take
the washing out of the machine?

68
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,392
- No.
- What do you mean "no"?

69
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,636
No, I didn't take
the washing out of the machine.

70
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,910
- It's gonna go really stale...
- It'll be fine.

71
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,235
- It's not fine.
- It's fine. I'll wear stale pants.

72
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,555
I don't want to go out
with someone in stale pants.

73
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,636
Well, there we go.
I could go commando.

74
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,115
But I don't think
that's accepted in government.

75
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,595
Have you got everything
you need for your first day?

76
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,551
Oh, yes, all in here.
My massive intellect

77
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,875
and an apple for Simon Foster.

78
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,831
Simon "Fluster", don't you mean?

79
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,076
Don't call him that. I'm rebranding him.

80
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,509
He was absolutely crap
on the radio last night.

81
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,710
He sounded like a chicken
with a wasp up its arse.

82
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,592
You give me a week,
I'll have him sounding

83
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,551
like a chicken
without a wasp up its arse.

84
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,274
Good luck at the Foreign Office.
Try not to annoy Russia.

85
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,197
- See you later.
- See you later.

86
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,595
I'll give you a call later.
Keep your phone on.

87
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,314
- Be careful. Cars.
- Oh, really? Thanks for that.

88
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,396
Helpful...

89
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,950
OK, OK, go ahead
and print "unforeseeable".

90
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,672
Listen, assume I tell your wife

91
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,314
about you and Angela Heaney
at the Blackpool conference,

92
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,829
what would be best,
an e-mail, a phone call or what?

93
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,679
I could write it on a cake!
With those little silver balls.

94
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,439
"Your hack husband
betrayed you on October 4th...

95
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,516
and congratulations on the new baby."

96
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,870
Yeah,
maybe it's better to spike it, yeah.

97
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,831
OK, fuckity bye.

98
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,076
<i>Did you put away the lasagne?</i>

99
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,111
Yes, of course, it's in the fridge.

100
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,390
It's got Clingfilm on it and everything.

101
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,317
<i>Why did you put Clingfilm on it?</i>

102
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,360
Because that keeps it fresh.
That's the point of Clingfilm.

103
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,118
No, I don't want to hold.

104
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,229
It might dry out.

105
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,509
That's an amateur mistake.

106
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,996
I'm not holding any longer. What's
he waiting for, a fucking sex change?

107
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,269
It's not carcinogenic.

108
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,197
What, Simon Foster?

109
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,117
Clingfilm doesn't give you cancer.

110
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,037
Diarrhoea Of A Nobody. I like that.

111
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,991
- Aluminium foil...
- Apropos of that...

112
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,953
...gives you AIDS, or, you know,
lasagne gives you syphilis.

113
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,548
- It's not a thing.
- No, you relax!

114
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,159
<i>God, who's that?</i>

115
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,111
<i>Get me fucking Brian!</i>

116
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,152
<i>If you don't get me fucking Brian,
I'm gonna come over there.</i>

117
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,316
I'm gonna lock you in
a fucking flotation tank

118
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,635
and pump it full of sewage
until you fucking drown.

119
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,638
- Paris Hilton.
- Are you serious?

120
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,193
- Lily Allen.
- No, no women.

121
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,757
- Yeah?
- The Olsen twins.

122
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,314
- Thank you.
- Who's that?

123
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,671
- Malcolm. He's coming to see you.
- Oh, shit, he's still alive.

124
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,916
- When's he due?
- Now!

125
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,713
And don't say you weren't prepared,
because I rang ahead.

126
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,070
Give us a minute,
could you, please, luv?

127
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,909
In the words
of the late, great Nat King fucking Cole,

128
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,349
unforeseeable, that's what you are.

129
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,436
Who's that geezer?

130
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,877
Oh, I know who he is.

131
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,230
You're Dan, right?

132
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,590
- Daniel? The new adviser?
- Toby.

133
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,631
Toby. Oh. Sorry about the "Dan" thing.

134
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,593
You guys are often called "Dan"
so it's worth a punt.

135
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,438
I'm Judy, by the way. Judy Molloy.

136
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,233
Director of Communications
for International Development.

137
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,429
Is this a normal morning?

138
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,516
The minister was rubbish
on last night's interview...

139
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,790
- He was rubbish?
- Yes. Rubbish.

140
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,390
Come on, Malcolm, he asked me for...
for a personal opinion.

141
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,671
Why didn't you say? He asked you.
Fuck, of course, that explains it.

142
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,951
If he'd asked you to fucking black up,
or to give him your PIN number

143
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,116
or to shit yourself,
would you have done that?

144
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,754
Blacked up, yes.
It was radio, nobody would've known.

145
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,029
Very good.

146
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,515
War is basically unforeseeable, isn't it?

147
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,677
That is not our line.
Walk the fucking line.

148
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,792
We've got Karen Clark
over from Washington today.

149
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,229
We've got enough
fucking Pentagon goons here

150
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,793
to stage a fucking coup d'état.

151
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,070
- Minister.
- Not the time, love.

152
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,031
- I'm busy. Fuck off.
- This is Toby.

153
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,357
Toby, hi. I'm glad you could make it.
It's a bit of an odd morning here.

154
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,948
Welcome to the madhouse.
I apologise for Malcolm.

155
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,674
Don't apologise for me.
Apologise for yourself.

156
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,519
Did I not just tell you to fuck off
and yet you're still here?

157
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,437
It's true, I am, yes, still here.

158
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,039
Hi, foetus boy,

159
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,674
lesson one, I tell you to fuck off,
what do you do?

160
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,631
Eff off?

161
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,591
You'll go far.

162
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,597
- Now, fuck off.
- Right.

163
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,510
Judy and I were thinking that I could
row back on Question Time tonight.

164
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,915
You're not on Question Time.
You've been disinvited.

165
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,589
- We've been prepping Question Time.
- Why wasn't I told about this?

166
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,757
Why the fuck would I tell you about it?
I told you to fuck off twice.

167
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,509
It's a scheduled media appearance by
this department's secretary of state

168
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,517
so it falls well within my purview.

169
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,119
- Within your purview?
- Yes.

170
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,676
Where do you think you are, some
fucking Regency costume drama?

171
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,270
This is a government department,
not a fucking Jane fucking Austen novel.

172
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,198
- Malcolm...
- Allow me to pop a jaunty little bonnet

173
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,392
on your purview and ram it up
the shitter with a lubricated horse cock.

174
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,351
Your swearing does not impress me.

175
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,153
My husband works for Tower Hamlets
and believe me,

176
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,874
those kids make you sound like...
Angela Lansbury.

177
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,638
She's married? Poor bastard.

178
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:52,038
Malcolm, Judy's lubricated horse cock
aside for a second,

179
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,755
are you saying I'm now no longer
allowed to make media appearances?

180
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,599
Correct. Not until we can trust you
to keep the line.

181
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,234
I was going to keep to the line.
I was going to say,

182
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,669
I don't think war is unforeseeable...

183
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,598
- What is it, then?
- I dunno. Foreseeable? No.

184
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,518
No! Not foreseeable.
That's fucking declaring war.

185
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,437
Do you want to fucking declare war?

186
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,518
I'm a Cabinet minister.
I didn't get here by screwing up

187
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,756
every media appearance I ever had.

188
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,758
Write this down. It's neither
foreseeable nor unforeseeable.

189
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,633
Right, so not inevitable, but not...

190
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,751
You'd better walk on this fucking line.

191
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,279
...evitable.

192
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,029
You, hey, put the snifter out there
that if the BBC ambushes a minister

193
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,277
with another surprise question about
the war, I'll drop a bomb on them.

194
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,231
I can't do that, can I? That's political.

195
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,432
Does that not fit within your purview,
Marie Antoinette?

196
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,120
Why don't you just scuttle off back
to fucking Cranford

197
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,516
and play around with your tea and your
cakes and your fucking horse cocks.

198
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,189
Let them eat cock! Hey, you!
Ron Weasley, you do it.

199
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,269
No, no, you needn't worry about
the Canadians,

200
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,231
they're just happy to be there.

201
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,716
Yes, well, they always look surprised
when they're invited.

202
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,513
Shall I just give Toby a call
about this Simon Foster thing?

203
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,870
Yes, good idea.
No, I'm not talking to you.

204
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,991
Get me the Angolan chargé d'affaires.

205
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,475
Yes, well stop him playing football.

206
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,794
Hello.

207
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,876
So, how's it going? Found the bogs?

208
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,831
It's a bit... manic.

209
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:18,033
Never like this at Agriculture. People
tend not to get so sweary about wheat.

210
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,799
Sorry, Michael, do you mind
just turning it down a bit?

211
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,310
Just a little bit... grating. Bloody music.

212
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,034
Listen,
I've got a bit of leg-up for you, actually.

213
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,517
Yeah. I think we can get Simon Foster
into the three o'clock with Karen Clark.

214
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,278
<i>Karen Clark?</i>

215
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,631
Was she the woman who went round
Britain in a coracle for leukaemia?

216
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,718
No, Toby. Karen Clark,
US Assistant Secretary of State.

217
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,593
Oh, right, Karen Clark. Wow, great.

218
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,280
- Michael wants to say something.
- Meat.

219
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,879
Meat?

220
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,039
His man is only going to be meat in
the room. No talking. He's just padding.

221
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,958
<i>The Americans don't feel like
they're getting a proper meeting</i>

222
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,514
<i>unless there's 30 people on each side,</i>

223
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,756
<i>so he's basically like bulk in the room.</i>

224
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,440
<i>He's not exactly going to be relevant,
but he'll be present.</i>

225
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,198
I won't tell him that, to be honest.

226
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,517
- OK, I've got to go, darling. I love you.
- OK, yes, likewise.

227
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,232
Affirmative on that one.

228
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,555
All right, darling, take care, bye.

229
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,955
Can I turn it back up now?

230
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,878
You're on sexual health, aren't you?
That's ironic.

231
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,831
Right, Toby, quick tour.

232
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,520
- I should probably just go and...
- This is Mike.

233
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,279
Just leave it to Mike,
cos he knows what he's doing.

234
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,231
- Don't you, Mike?
- What?

235
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,715
Exactly. He's an idiot.

236
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,389
Listen, I understand your hostility
at new wood being brought in.

237
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,636
Sorry, that's the end of the tour,
I'm afraid.

238
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,719
There is really a lot of very important
people that you ought to know about,

239
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,558
but I have to...

240
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,237
- Toby, hi.
- All right, boss.

241
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,669
I'm sorry about earlier. Malcolm.

242
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,189
- He's a bit of an alpha male, isn't he?
- Yes.

243
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,117
Listen,

244
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,037
I was just um...

245
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,957
- Don't sit on Anna's desk.
- Sorry.

246
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:02,757
I have managed to get you into the big
Foreign Office meeting this afternoon.

247
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,394
The Karen Clark meeting?
Really? Shit.

248
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,999
How did you do that?

249
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,588
I did it through sheer bloody hard work.

250
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,358
- Judy?
- Yeah?

251
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,678
Tobes here has got me into the big
Karen Clark meeting this afternoon.

252
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,074
Oh!

253
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,031
The big "meat".

254
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,913
Impressive, eh?
How are you spelling that, by the way?

255
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,837
Two "E"s.

256
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,109
Oh, right.

257
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,037
Just one thing.

258
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:31,312
Talkingwise, you might find once
we get in there, that the bulk of it...

259
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,431
- Can we just wait for Judy?
- Of course.

260
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,516
Simon.

261
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,675
Michael, hi.

262
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,597
Hello. Welcome.

263
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,358
- Michael?
- Yes.

264
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,916
I'm Chad. We'd like a dual horseshoe
formation for the meeting set-up.

265
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,350
An enclave for Ms Clark. An enclave
for the Pentagon delegation.

266
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,516
And, politely, we request the presence

267
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,029
of both carbonated
and non-carbonated waters.

268
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,832
Right.

269
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,190
- Is that all?
- Yeah, that's it. Thank you so much.

270
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,232
Not at all. Wow, who was that?
Young Lankenstein?

271
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,993
He's probably running
something relatively major.

272
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,951
They're all kids in Washington.

273
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,799
It's like Bugsy Malone,
but with real guns.

274
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,712
Thank you all for coming today

275
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,354
to the Interim Anglo-American
Resources Forum.

276
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,232
I'd particularly like to welcome...

277
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,271
What's your view like?

278
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,834
- Well, it's pretty basic.
- OK, can we swap?

279
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,838
I don't want a consensus
forming around the premise

280
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:30,556
that military action is necessarily
the primary option at this point.

281
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:34,719
This paper which was authored
by one of my aides, Liza Weld...

282
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,752
Liza, I hope you don't mind
if I foreground this paper.

283
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,189
<i>It's not strictly my paper.</i>

284
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,437
In the sense that you were the one
who put in the requests...

285
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,870
Miss Weld is very, very modest,
but this is her paper.

286
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,798
And she's highlighted several reasons

287
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,913
why we cannot envision a theatre
deployment for at least 12 months.

288
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,430
Should I say something? She invited
me. I should say something.

289
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,676
If you don't say something
in the first ten minutes,

290
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,756
then you might as well
not say anything at all.

291
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,836
I really think
you shouldn't say anything.

292
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,236
- No, I should say something.
- No, Simon, don't, just don't...

293
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,998
Don't pull my hand down.

294
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,873
The committee feels
a quicker deployment is possible.

295
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,194
Ah, which committee?

296
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,550
It was discussed
in a number of committees.

297
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,910
- If I mentioned one committee...
- You did.

298
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,837
...then it was a slip of the tongue.

299
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:23,509
What, because you've accidentally
alluded to a secret committee,

300
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,119
a war committee?

301
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,789
If I may intercept. I understand
we are rather pressed for time.

302
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,753
Liza, do you know if Linton
has set up a secret war committee?

303
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,996
- No. I have no idea.
- Get me on it.

304
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,271
I think it's worth noting
that ministers in the UK government,

305
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,517
such as our colleague here,
Simon Foster,

306
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:45,270
have made it very clear that they feel
currently war is unforeseeable.

307
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,039
Isn't that right, Simon?

308
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,877
Er... well, yes.

309
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,275
That's... That's what I said.

310
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,789
And I stick to what I said.

311
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,188
That doesn't mean that what I said
won't change... in the future.

312
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,117
Um... it's not immutable

313
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,071
or mutable.

314
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,077
It's... It's... It's...

315
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,031
It's a developing...

316
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,515
I think there are
areas of mutual discussion

317
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:17,519
that we could come onto now, and then
maybe if there's time left at the end...

318
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,632
Judy, can you just pass that on?
Is that fine?

319
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,558
Yes, that's all fine, thank you.

320
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,997
Right, come here. We need to talk.
What do you mean, "Stop being a tit?"

321
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,951
In what way was I being a tit?

322
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,832
Why am I even over here?

323
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,155
You were just meat in the room, Simon.

324
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,111
- Yeah...
- Meat in the room?

325
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,037
Yeah.

326
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,436
For fuck's sake, Judy, I've taken
an hour out to come over here

327
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,152
and be room meat.

328
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,111
Yes, but... but a prime cut,

329
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,673
you know, not offal.

330
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,677
Oh, great. I'm not liver.

331
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,631
What was I, tit meat?

332
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,591
Well, no, I just...

333
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,917
Come on. Let's get back.

334
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,837
- Hey, Liza.
- Hey.

335
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,236
I just want to say congratulations.
Your paper got a major citation.

336
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,828
You must be psyched
that Karen brought it up.

337
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,838
Yeah, well, that was,
you know, her call. Not mine.

338
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,075
You couldn't write a paper

339
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,272
that clashes more violently with
the current climate if you were trying.

340
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,038
It seems like you almost were trying.

341
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:18,232
- I wasn't trying! Believe me.
- You're like the woman in The Omen.

342
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,794
You've given birth to a demon
and now it's gonna kill you.

343
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,559
You probably identify
with the kid from The Omen.

344
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,989
See, you're an only child, aren't you?

345
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,917
I don't understand how my parents'

346
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,873
limited reproductive ability
reflects badly on me.

347
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,956
I'm the sperm that made it, so...

348
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,036
- Liza.
- I'm being called by our boss.

349
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,958
- OK, retreat. See you later.
- Yeah, have fun with yourself.

350
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,116
Have fun with your career kryptonite.

351
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,799
What's going on down there?
That looks important.

352
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,036
My teeth are killing me.
Are they chipped?

353
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,515
I think that one
has always been there, right?

354
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,029
It was a chip on the veneer.

355
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,357
- Don't look at my teeth for a long time.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

356
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,436
- It just surprised me.
- Liza!

357
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,595
Toby.

358
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,836
Toby! Hi.

359
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,791
- Hi.
- Give me a call!

360
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,309
- Yeah.
- OK.

361
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,989
Liza Weld. She did the
Kennedy Scholarship at my college.

362
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,918
- I had a little thing for her at the time.
- I can imagine, yeah.

363
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,031
Don't think she remembered me,
to be honest.

364
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,390
That is one
of the side-effects of Rohypnol.

365
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,670
Linton has set up
a secret war committee. I just know it.

366
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,837
I mean, Linton is an absolute lunatic,
Liza.

367
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,313
- He is dangerous.
- It's not good.

368
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,749
The voices in his head
now sing barbershop together.

369
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,551
I really, really hope there isn't a war,
it's going to be a nightmare.

370
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,240
It's bad enough having to cope
with the fucking Olympics.

371
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,555
- Minister?
- Just a quick word, sir?

372
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,399
This is your chance to nail the line.
Do you want to nail the line?

373
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,829
No, I'll freestyle it.
Hello, there. Hi.

374
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,871
So is war unforeseeable, Minister?

375
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,278
Look, all sorts of things,
that are actually very likely

376
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,391
are also unforeseeable.

377
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:55,913
For the plane in the fog,
the mountain is un... unforeseeable,

378
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:00,079
but then it is suddenly
very real and inevitable.

379
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,397
Is this your opinion or is this
the government position?

380
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,999
The mountain in the metaphor is

381
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,271
a completely hypothetical mountain
that could represent anything.

382
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,550
So, who is the plane,
and who is the mountain?

383
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,148
- Is the government lost in the fog?
- What I'm saying is...

384
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,191
that to walk the road of peace...

385
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:20,872
sometimes we need to be ready
to climb... the mountain of conflict.

386
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,638
Thank you so much.

387
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,070
Thank you. That's it,
ladies and gentlemen, thank you.

388
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,795
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,
why didn't we nail the line?

389
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,751
Simon, I did try to warn you.

390
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,758
Yes, you tried to warn me, but
you didn't actually stop me, did you?

391
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,598
I can't tackle you to the ground.

392
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,030
That's like shouting "Train!"
at somebody as they get hit by a train.

393
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,435
You should go "Train!
There's a fucking train!"

394
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,232
Bollocks!

395
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,874
- Fuck, it's Malcolm.
- It's Malcolm for me, too.

396
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,831
How does he do that?

397
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,873
Simon, I don't like finding out about
people employed by this government

398
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,116
via the news, unless they've just died.

399
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,389
Be here, now.

400
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,317
<i>The British Government
must be prepared</i>

401
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,839
<i>to climb the mountain of conflict.</i>

402
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,110
<i>It's unclear if his view
is shared by the Prime Minister.</i>

403
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,073
<i>Maybe we should get it out there.</i>

404
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,272
Float the idea that the war
is a resigning issue for you.

405
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,437
You can't say it's a resigning issue,
because then you have to resign.

406
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,518
You're having a really great first day,
you know that?

407
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,200
You are supposed to be
a Cabinet minister!

408
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,039
You are supposed to be Officer Class!

409
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,958
Don't do this,
don't make fucking waves.

410
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,275
We can do without
the ritual humiliation.

411
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,152
You know I'm against
talking up the war.

412
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,713
You're against talking up the war?

413
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,354
Is that why you said
"climb the mountain of conflict"?

414
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,913
Do you know what you sounded like?

415
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,235
A fucking Nazi Julie Andrews.

416
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:39,559
I'm just saying I might be forced
to the verge of making a stand.

417
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,636
A stand?

418
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,154
Right, The White Stripes, outside.

419
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,032
Uh-uh.

420
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,514
There's only two people
in The White Stripes.

421
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,991
I um...

422
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,438
I admire you.

423
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,311
I really do, I admire you.

424
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,317
Making a stand.

425
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,070
So, I take it, I can tell the PM that you...
you don't want to go to Washington?

426
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,316
- To where?
- To Washington.

427
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,908
See, the PM, he wants you...
Well, he wanted you

428
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,917
to go on a fact-finder, you know.

429
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,749
Problems we might have to face if it
all goes boombastic in the Middle East.

430
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,518
Oh, right.

431
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,632
But, you know, that's you,
you're on the verge, aren't you?

432
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,115
You're on the verge of your stand, so...

433
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,878
Well, Malcolm, come on,

434
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,912
I don't know what words I used
in the heat of the moment.

435
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,271
Maybe in a sense, yeah, I am on the
verge, but that's the important thing.

436
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,836
I'm on the verge.
I'm not in any way decided.

437
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,520
Christ on a bendy-bus.
Don't be such a fucking faff arse.

438
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,393
No, I'm standing my ground,
on the verge.

439
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,670
Right, OK,
well, when you go to America,

440
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,030
talk to Karen Clark
at the State Department, yeah?

441
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,072
- Right, OK. I'll give it a whirl.
- Keep away from Linton Barwick.

442
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,031
He's pushing the war
for Caulderwood's lot.

443
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:00,675
I'll deal with him. He uses a live hand
grenade as a fucking paper weight.

444
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,438
That's a true story.

445
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,676
Wow, I won't talk to him.

446
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,076
Talk to as few people as possible,
that would be best for you.

447
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,998
OK, Liza, the priorities are shower,
get me on Linton's war committee

448
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,351
and get me to a dentist,
not necessarily in that order.

449
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,152
Shower later.

450
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,510
What has Linton been up to
while we've been gone?

451
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,596
Have we declared war
on California yet?

452
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,278
Ah, Karen.

453
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,153
- How was London? Good meetings?
- Very good meetings.

454
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,431
You know we had some
great discussions there, I think our...

455
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,677
Thank you very much, and I will read
your words when they come through.

456
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,631
Thank you so much, Karen, hm. Bob.

457
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,716
You won't read the words, Linton.

458
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,632
Is Chad coming? Chad?

459
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,832
No, he's probably doing
his desperate chorus girl thing,

460
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:48,192
hanging around Linton's office,
trying to catch an eye, you know.

461
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,392
That's why he's wearing his
push-up bra today. Have you noticed?

462
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,239
- Assistant Secretary of State, hi.
- Brad, how are you?

463
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,998
- Chad.
- Yep, yep, yep, exactly.

464
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,918
- Can I...?
- Yep, you betcha, OK.

465
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,631
Hey, listen, the war committee.

466
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,591
What you have to do
is you've got to look for

467
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,917
the ten dullest-named committees
happening out of the executive branch.

468
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:10,555
Because Linton is not going to call it
the "Big Horrible War Committee".

469
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,752
He's gonna hide it
behind a name like "Diverse Strategy".

470
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,678
Something so dull
you're just gonna want to self-harm.

471
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,712
Get me General Miller
at the Pentagon, please.

472
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,796
My teeth hurt.

473
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,990
My teeth hurt like hell.

474
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,120
I'm sick of hearing about
the teeth, frankly.

475
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,039
Hi, yeah.
I'm checking the status on a paper

476
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,832
that was circulated by a staffer here.

477
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,439
It's called...

478
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:38,758
"Post War Planning. Parameters,
Implications and Possibilities".

479
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,078
This is the one by...
this is the one by Liza Weld, right?

480
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,191
"PWIP PIP"?

481
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,231
Oh, God, it already has an acronym.

482
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,828
You know another acronym? DOA...

483
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,190
Your career.

484
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:58,111
My golly, I can't see why anyone would
choose to work in a glass office, huh?

485
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,994
Glass offices,
in my opinion, are for perverts.

486
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,917
I could request the glass be frosted.

487
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,792
Frosting is on cakes, huh?

488
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,753
Now, what else happened in London?

489
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,235
Ah, generally positive, two glitches...

490
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,839
Really, what?

491
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,394
Karen flagged a report
by one of her staffers.

492
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:20,230
She's obviously trying to use it as some
kind of roadblock. It's called PWIP PIP.

493
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,590
- PWIP what?
- PWIP PIP.

494
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,598
What is it, a report on bird calls?
What does it even stand for?

495
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,076
I can't recall. It's factish.
Intel for and against intervention.

496
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,988
We have all the facts on this we need.
We don't need any more facts.

497
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,156
In the land of truth, my friend...

498
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,230
...the man with one fact is the king.

499
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,113
You said there was something else,
what is that?

500
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,310
In the meeting with the Foreign Office,

501
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,557
the committee was accidentally
and briefly alluded to.

502
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,238
Which committee?

503
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,430
The... The war committee, sir.

504
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,518
All right,
Karen is not to know about this, huh?

505
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:57,030
She is an excitable, yapping she-dog.

506
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,628
Get a hold of those minutes.
I have to correct the record.

507
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,796
- We can do that?
- Yes, we can.

508
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,036
Those minutes are an aide-mémoire
for us.

509
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:08,711
They should not be a reductive record
of what happened to have been said,

510
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:12,628
but they should be more a full record of
what was intended to have been said.

511
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,558
I think that's the more accurate version,
don't you?

512
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,193
- Sir.
- Right.

513
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,754
I don't like this section, let's cut that.

514
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,677
Aye aye, sir.

515
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,119
Let's reverse this.

516
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,071
That was something Karen said, sir.

517
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,270
Well, it's not right, so let's change it.

518
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,073
- Aye, aye, sir.
- And... And I like... I like this.

519
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,792
Ah, thank you, sir.

520
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,309
Yeah, let's say
everyone agreed with that, huh?

521
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:38,592
So... So the car
will pick you up from the airport.

522
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,870
It's supposed to be
quite a good one, I believe.

523
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,753
The Americans are doing that.
I've just got the contact numbers.

524
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,836
What's she so fucking happy about?

525
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,837
She's probably just on a personal call.

526
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,030
Why has she got control of the blinds?

527
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,149
I think it's...

528
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:57,796
I'm a government minister and
I don't have control of my own blinds.

529
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:01,959
I could order you some blinds. I could
order you some nice, heavy curtains,

530
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,196
with swags and a pelmet maybe.

531
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,788
Yes, do that.

532
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,672
OK.

533
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,551
Will you come with me?

534
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:22,639
So, listen... my team for the US,
Team Simon...

535
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:26,275
I'm thinking of taking you
and leaving Judy.

536
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,838
I could work with that, definitely.

537
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,552
Plus, she can be a bit, you know...

538
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,114
"Everything's a bit shit, isn't it?"
Like that.

539
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,958
Yeah, it's true. No, she can be,

540
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:39,073
"Oh, so you're the President and
I'm supposed to be impressed by that?"

541
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,078
"My husband works in Tower Hamlets.
Meh, meh, meh."

542
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,430
"Which is much harder
than being President."

543
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:48,109
Yeah, OK. Well, that's settled. Fuck it,
she's staying here. Go and tell her.

544
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,753
What?

545
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,997
<i>Well, that moves us on
to any other business.</i>

546
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,510
I think I've flagged everything
that I need to discuss, as I usually do.

547
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,517
<i>Everything you're preparedto discuss.</i>

548
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,993
What is that? What are you doing?

549
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,669
I understand you've started a new
committee, Linton. What is that called?

550
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,153
What makes you think that?

551
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,396
It was mentioned
at our meeting in London.

552
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,794
Well, you must have misheard me.

553
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,150
No. I misheard the word "committee"?

554
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,157
Maybe it was another word.

555
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,077
Like, say, Khomeini.

556
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,431
- You're sitting on a new Khomeini?
- Possibly. There are a lot of words.

557
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,516
Kansas City. Kitty.

558
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,232
- Itty.
- "Itty?"

559
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,588
"Itty" is not a word, Bob.

560
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,234
- Commissary.
- Thank you, James...

561
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,555
Why don't you just recap for me,
at the moment,

562
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,910
all the committees
that you're currently sitting on?

563
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:34,919
I'm sorry, Karen, but you... you appear
to be bleeding from the teeth.

564
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,632
Let me see that. Holy Mother of...

565
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,149
Well, don't try to change the subject.

566
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,953
I'm sorry, everyone. I'm sorry.
Just ignore the blood.

567
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:46,197
- We haven't finished the meeting.
- I can't ignore... I'm sorry.

568
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,595
I don't mean to be rude,
but this is a tad repulsive.

569
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,030
I'm sorry. Excuse me.
Liza, come with me, I need you.

570
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,149
Chad, stay here.

571
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,874
Go, Buffy, you belong
to the vampire queen now.

572
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,797
- Liza.
- I'm coming.

573
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,673
Oh, my God. Shit! He's in there alone.

574
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,109
I cannot stand to see
a woman bleed from the mouth.

575
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:07,313
It reminds me of country and western
music, which I cannot abide. Huh?

576
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,193
That stuff is just choking the airwaves.

577
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,550
- Look, sorry, we just need...
- Oh, my God!

578
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,752
- It's really bad. It's really bad.
- I can't touch anything...

579
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,440
- Nobody was joking.
- It's... I need to catch it.

580
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,437
How far are you with the committees?

581
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,198
I've got it down to two, actually.

582
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,993
One is the "Aims and
Policy Alignment Committee".

583
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,190
The other is the
"Future Planning Committee".

584
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,629
It's not the first one,
because I set that up.

585
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,957
Does it really sound dull to you?
I thought it was a good name.

586
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,992
Right, no... it is a good name.

587
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:39,510
Well, find out if it really is the...
"Future Planning Committee".

588
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,631
Find out if it really is that.

589
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:45,309
Um... OK, well, I might go and do that.

590
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,113
You're not going to shout at me
if I go and do that, are you?

591
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,117
I'm not a monster, Liza. OK?

592
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,312
Will you stop implying
that I'm some kind of monster?

593
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,312
Bob!

594
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,237
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

595
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:03,069
I wanted to tell you
we're having this stupid

596
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,510
"hunk of the month of the office"
kind of contest.

597
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,349
And I just didn't want, you know,
you to feel objectified in any way,

598
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,630
- or anything like that.
- No, not at all.

599
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,274
And Karen knows about
the Future Planning Committee.

600
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,556
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

601
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,671
- No?
- No.

602
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,472
Excuse me.

603
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,114
Future Planning Committee,
that's what it is.

604
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,997
Wow!

605
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,951
This is fucking cool.

606
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,878
Don't be callow, Toby,
we're on official business.

607
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,434
- This way, gentlemen.
- Oh, thanks.

608
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,315
That was a little bit fucking cool.

609
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,759
Yep.

610
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,348
- Did you book a car?
- Me? No.

611
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,074
Well, Judy will have booked a car.

612
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,394
Judy?

613
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,715
- Hi.
- For fuck's sake!

614
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,637
I was wondering
what the car situation is?

615
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,638
It's Robbie's job to book it
and your job to check it.

616
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:08,196
There's obviously...
some snarl-up at her end, I think.

617
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,276
- "Simon Forester."
- Oh.

618
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,079
Thank you very much.

619
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,998
"England Government,
Simon Forester."

620
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,315
My name's Simon Foster,
it's British Government.

621
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,833
Hey, Gav, I'm in a fucking motorcade.

622
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,313
Yeah.

623
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,793
I feel like we should have hookers,
do you know what I mean?

624
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,876
I mean in here... now.

625
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:43,279
- Do you want girls?
- No, no, no, no, no, no. Absolutely not.

626
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,153
No, sorry.
No hookers, it was just a joke.

627
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,274
I hate hookers. Not in
an aggressive way, but, no, thank you.

628
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,592
Strange hotel.

629
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,837
It's like a hangar
for businessmen, isn't it?

630
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,797
- That's better, isn't it?
- It's big, yeah.

631
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,876
Just bring them here, that's fine.

632
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,440
Tobes, have you got any m...

633
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,796
Well, I haven't been to an ATM,
so I've not... I've only got English.

634
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,990
I mean,
I don't suppose English money is...

635
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,997
This and this, sorry that's...

636
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,076
It's usually a dollar a bag.

637
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,717
Ooh, well, there's the Capitol,

638
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,229
you can see there through
that window and that tree.

639
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,796
Technically,
you've got a Capitol Hill view.

640
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,510
Hi.

641
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,596
Excuse me.

642
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,153
Hello. How are you doing?

643
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,589
Was it something I said?
I haven't seen you in a month.

644
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,870
I haven't felt that in years. Thank you.

645
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,115
You're beautiful.

646
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,118
Oh, thank you.
I'm sure you say that to all the girls.

647
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:56,391
Yes, I do...
and some of the soldiers, too.

648
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,080
That's why you shouldn't
run for office, bimbo eruptions.

649
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,839
Come on, don't believe that shit.
I'm not gonna run for office.

650
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,235
I'm just trying to do something different.

651
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,998
It's one of the reasons I like you.

652
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,509
I know your passion
about education and housing and...

653
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,074
- Lingerie. Bestiality.
- There you go.

654
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,316
I'd forgotten about that.

655
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,590
Are you still allergic to the dog?

656
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,871
Yes, yes, I wake up and my eyes
are closed and my head is swollen

657
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,752
and I look like a giant ball sac.

658
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,518
Oh, my God. You know,

659
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,518
they do have modern medication
for that sort of thing.

660
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,710
- Beautiful ball sac, though.
- Thank you very much.

661
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,990
- How's the Pentagon?
- It's kicked up a little.

662
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,509
They're talking invasion
reasonably seriously.

663
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,756
Is there somewhere
we can talk about this?

664
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,711
- I don't know.
- There must be.

665
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,035
- I don't live here.
- Follow me.

666
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,958
- Go that way.
- Don't let people know we're leaving.

667
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,992
This is good. Her daughter's not home,
I talked to her.

668
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,917
- In here?
- Yeah.

669
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,749
Although, I don't know what we'll say
if somebody comes in right now.

670
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,155
No, I can't think
of a good possible excuse, no.

671
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,838
No, me neither, me neither.

672
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,552
- What?
- Come here.

673
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,591
Just be careful, don't mess stuff up.

674
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,030
- Oh, come on, it's toys.
- Let's sit down.

675
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,116
- So...
- Yeah.

676
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,752
Not enough troops.

677
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,996
Total minimum
European Theatre requirement.

678
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,951
The Far East, Asia.

679
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,514
- OK. That's how many we have?
- Total there, yes.

680
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,870
And then we have the contingency
already deployed.

681
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,877
OK, I don't... You've lost me.

682
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,070
Hold on a minute...

683
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,031
Oh, fuck this.

684
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,718
What?

685
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,198
# La la la, la la la la, la la la.

686
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,355
Good.

687
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,040
Your military hardware
is impressive, General.

688
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,116
Yeah, well, not any more, it isn't.

689
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,879
So, you add these together.

690
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:47,398
So this is the number of combat troops
available for an invasion,

691
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,919
according to these figures.

692
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,519
<i>12!</i>

693
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,198
Thousand?

694
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,117
No, 12. 12 troops.

695
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,753
Oh, come on, you're shitting me?

696
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,236
I am shitting you.
12,000 troops, 12,000 troops,

697
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:04,114
but that's not enough...
that's the amount that are going to die.

698
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,834
And at the end of a war
you need some soldiers left, really,

699
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,678
or else it looks like you've lost.

700
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,711
<i>Bye, for now.</i>

701
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,513
You know what? I've got some Brits
I have to meet tomorrow.

702
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,198
A guy named Simon Foster.

703
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,958
Who's Simon Foster?

704
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,390
He's this guy that said publicly
that war was unforeseeable.

705
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:24,239
And I think he could be very useful
on the war committee.

706
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,920
He can internationalise the dissent,
start to.

707
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,793
You're going to use him
as a little meat puppet?

708
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,157
Tobes... hi.

709
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,077
Hi.

710
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,919
What are we gonna... do tonight?

711
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,672
Gonna do tonight?

712
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:56,509
Yes, what are we up to, my...
my chief aide...?

713
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,234
Well... yeah, I mean,
I sort of thought tonight

714
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,113
we'd probably be just a bit tired, really.

715
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,677
No, I am tired.
But I'm also a career politician, Toby,

716
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:10,270
in the political powerhouse of the world
for 48 hours,

717
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:14,518
and I thought it might be nice to go out
rather than just sitting in my room

718
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,074
trying to spank one out
over a shark documentary,

719
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,792
because I'm scared if I watch a porno

720
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:22,151
it'll end up in
the register of members' interests. So...

721
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,312
What have you got... for us to do?

722
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,159
Right, what have I got?
Well, so far we've got...

723
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,078
Well, there's a leaflet through the door

724
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,510
for happy hour at the bar
which might be interesting.

725
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,590
Also I do have the number of a guy

726
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:41,315
I was at uni with
who works for CNN out here.

727
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,396
- No.
- No?

728
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,189
- Where are you?
- I'm waving at you.

729
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,912
I don't see you, be more visible.

730
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:53,635
I'm, like, practically on top of you, I'm
coming to you, is what I'm going to do.

731
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,876
You can stop talking
on your cellphone now.

732
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,638
Of course I can.

733
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,274
Look, I have to leave.
Phone Simon Foster's guy.

734
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,311
Tell them, come to the war committee.

735
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,000
I'll give them some face time
tomorrow around ten o'clock.

736
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,157
It'll be coffee and Danish.
Tea. They'll want tea.

737
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,919
Tea and sympathy,
tea and a hand job, whatever.

738
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,432
<i>... great deal that is unknown
about hammerhead sharks,</i>

739
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,834
<i>such as their mating habits.</i>

740
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,235
You can definitely spot
the female ones.

741
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,389
Hello.

742
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,557
Hi, Toby, what are you doing tonight?

743
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:27,433
Well, no, it's unbelievably hectic.
Actually we're...

744
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,516
<i>Their courtship is a violent affair.</i>

745
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:32,871
<i>The male will bite the female
until she acquiesces.</i>

746
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,753
The war committee, that's a big thing,
Liza.

747
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,838
Yeah, well,
I have been on committees before,

748
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,509
the Challenges For The Cheese
Market, that was one of the big ones.

749
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,995
Yeah, God, yeah. Love a drink.

750
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,315
40 minutes is perfect, yeah, yeah.

751
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,795
Bye-bye. Bye. Bye. Bye, bye.

752
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,991
<i>- Matty, how's CNN?
- Great.</i>

753
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,758
I can't, mate, no.

754
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:59,395
Liza Weld has got us onto the Future
Planning Committee in the morning.

755
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,909
The "war committee"
to the likes of you and me.

756
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,632
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

757
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,957
The Future Planning Committee
is Linton's war committee.

758
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:10,311
Do you not work for CNN
or is it the Cartoon News Network?

759
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,514
Come in.
I just wasn't expecting to see you here.

760
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,029
Physically here.
Obviously you're always in my heart.

761
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:24,118
I'm here, I'm there, I'm fucking
everywhere, I'm the egg man.

762
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,515
Have you come to insult me
in a different time zone?

763
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,155
Yeah. No, sorry, I'm just off out
for a drink with her just now.

764
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:33,192
No. You're barking up
the wrong cock there, my friend.

765
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,959
Little Toby is staying very much
in his hammock this evening.

766
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,991
- Simon, I've got us on the...
- Hiya.

767
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,076
Jesus Christ, fucking hell, Malcolm.

768
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,589
You're supposed to shit yourself
in there, not out here.

769
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,952
I've got us on Linton's Future Planning
Committee for tomorrow morning.

770
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,275
Brilliant. What is that?

771
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,197
It's the war committee.

772
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,993
What? The actual war...
the actual war committee?

773
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:57,510
- Who's going to be there?
- Karen Clark, Liza Weld,

774
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,437
me and Simon...

775
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,357
Simon and me.

776
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:04,074
How about the rest of the committee,
who are they going to be?

777
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,509
Jimmy Osmond, Gwyneth Paltrow?
It's a diversion.

778
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,154
The real committee,
that's happening at the White House.

779
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,589
I'll text you the details,
because I'm going to go out

780
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:14,154
for a drink with
some State Department bods just now.

781
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,238
Don't mention this to the press, OK?
Don't mention it to anyone.

782
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:20,079
If the press get a whiff
that there's a war committee

783
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,316
even a cardboard one,
every fucker in this town

784
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,237
is gonna turn up and try and get on it.

785
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:27,113
So no matter what gay bar
you end up in, keep it shtoom.

786
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,952
I was watching that.

787
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,230
Yeah, well,
I have to have a word with you.

788
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,590
You might want
to slip into your negligee.

789
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,750
- You see this mosh pit?
- Yeah.

790
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:47,270
Well, they're mostly house staffers,
senators' interns.

791
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,597
Tonight they rage hard,
but tomorrow they go back to the Hill

792
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,678
and argue noise-reduction legislation.

793
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,673
- Is this yours or mine?
- I don't know, I've got three.

794
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,711
So one of these has got to be yours.

795
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,957
Those are like fluids that I've never...
would you call wax a fluid?

796
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,991
No, it's not a fluid, it's more of a...

797
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,839
- It's very intimate.
- It's an ooze... it's an ooze.

798
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,916
Ooo... eugh!

799
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:19,159
Karen will want you to say
"War is unforeseeable."

800
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,955
And Linton will want you to talk up the
"climbing the mountain of conflict" line.

801
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,911
You say nothing, OK?

802
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,589
You stay detached, otherwise
that's what I will do to your retinas.

803
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,551
Right. Can I go to bed now, please?

804
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,636
No, no, no, no.
We're going to stay here

805
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,149
and you are going to rehearse
saying nothing.

806
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,838
Am I being tortured?

807
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,918
You look worried.

808
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,157
It's the paper that I wrote for Karen.

809
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:47,158
It's called PWIP PIP, it's about war.

810
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,352
The pros and cons,
and I came up with too many cons.

811
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,948
I'm, like, fucking worried because...

812
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:56,231
this is, like, my career on the line.

813
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,431
I thought you were worried,
because you were looking worried.

814
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:04,519
But you know, don't...
I mean, don't... don't worry.

815
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,197
- Thank you.
- OK.

816
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,276
- Sure.
- Thank you.

817
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,671
God damn it!

818
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,192
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm just taking off my shoes.

819
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,197
Why is that? Is it a mosque?

820
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,151
It's just, like...

821
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,077
Is it... Is it a bouncy castle?

822
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,270
Can I just say,
what happens in Washington,

823
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,356
stays in Washington, yeah?

824
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:41,552
Well, I live in Washington, so that
doesn't, like, really work for me.

825
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,599
Yeah?

826
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,838
A number for a cab company
in Washington DC, please.

827
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,511
Just straight through, straight through.
Hi, I need a cab.

828
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:12,993
Well, I don't know.
I'm outside number 1427, moving on...

829
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,588
I don't know,
it's a nice street, it's quite leafy,

830
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,676
federal houses.

831
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,798
Marcel's is nice.

832
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,512
I like their wraps.

833
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,950
And you should go to La Taverna,
the Greek place, that's fantastic.

834
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,116
They do that thing
where they set fire to the cheese.

835
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,912
What's that called? It's a lot of fun.

836
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,110
Yes, it sounds fun.

837
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,991
And, well, there's the Aerospace
Museum and the National Gallery.

838
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,076
Do they set fire to the pictures?

839
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,511
Yeah.

840
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:57,192
Hi, sorry I'm so late for the meeting.
One or two issues getting here, but...

841
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,276
- I'm Karen.
- Hi. Toby.

842
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,879
Pull an all-nighter?

843
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:06,229
- Well, I... I was led astray.
- Oh. By who?

844
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:11,638
I... I just ran into some people
from the MoD and...

845
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,512
Not Penny Grayling?

846
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,278
No.

847
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,153
Another... gang.

848
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:21,033
Wow, I didn't realise we had
so many delegations in town.

849
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,754
No, well..."The British are coming!"

850
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,112
So...

851
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:34,676
Yeah, you know what? I have a lot
of things to check on just now.

852
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,156
So this would probably be
a good place to break things up.

853
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,429
No problem.

854
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,629
Brilliant.

855
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,318
Bye.

856
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,430
I've brought your bag for you.

857
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,559
Cheers, man.

858
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,558
Tobes, I don't want to have to
read you the riot act here,

859
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:56,070
but I am going to have to read you
some extracts from the riot act.

860
00:40:56,200 --> 00:41:00,955
Like section one, paragraph one: don't
leave your boss twisting in the wind,

861
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:05,676
and then burst in late
smelling like a pissed seaside donkey.

862
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,074
"The British are coming."

863
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,760
All right, I was late for the meeting.
I am sorry,

864
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,348
but it's not like I threw up in there, is it?

865
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,436
No, you're right, I'm being unfair.

866
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,918
I should be thanking you
for not throwing up.

867
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:23,510
Well done, you're a star.
You didn't wet yourself, did you?

868
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:27,189
You're in the right city.
You didn't say anything overtly racist.

869
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,993
You didn't pull your dick out
and start plucking it

870
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,429
and shouting, "Willy banjo."

871
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,676
No, I'm being really unfair.

872
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,634
You'd got so much right
without actually being there

873
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:42,309
for the beginning of one of the
most important moments of my career.

874
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,033
Thanks, you're a legend.

875
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:55,835
That was just the beginning, do you
think? Are we going back in there?

876
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,518
I don't know, we barely said hello.

877
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,358
I've had muggings
that lasted longer.

878
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,675
All we talked about
was flammable cheese.

879
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:05,839
What if our meeting has
finished? What if Karen comes back,

880
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,791
and then we're still sitting here?

881
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,754
It's going to be embarrassing, isn't it?
We're going to look like groupies.

882
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,518
What if the meeting hasn't finished?

883
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,437
And she comes back
and we've disappeared?

884
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,312
Maybe I could call Judy? She could...

885
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,876
Please can we try
and just do one thing without Judy?

886
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:21,830
Fine.

887
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:28,718
I think we've drawn long enough
from that... teat.

888
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,508
Surprisingly enough, a lot of the marble
in the building is not imported.

889
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,551
- Really?
- It's really interesting...

890
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:39,319
- If you study the stonework...
- Not at the moment.

891
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,317
So, you made it in OK, right?

892
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,829
Yeah, hunky-dory, thanks.
Can I get a coffee?

893
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,632
Sure, sure.

894
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:49,469
If we just get started, my assistant
should be bringing in coffee shortly.

895
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,437
Your assistant?

896
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,949
Yeah. So, item.

897
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:58,311
We need to have a conversation about
the mood of the British Parliament,

898
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,795
the bumps in the road ahead
and what not.

899
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:05,357
I'm sorry, I don't...
This situation here is... is this it?

900
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:07,675
No offence, son,
but you look like you should still be

901
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,950
at school with your head down
a fucking toilet.

902
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:13,675
Your first point there, the offence?
I'm afraid I'm going to have to take it.

903
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:17,395
Your second point, I'm 22, but item,
it's my birthday in nine days, so...

904
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,193
if it will make you feel more
comfortable, we could wait.

905
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,151
Don't get sarcastic with me, son.

906
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:25,158
We burned this tight-arsed city
to the ground in 1814.

907
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,239
And I'm all for doing it again,
starting with you, you frat fuck.

908
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,112
You get sarcastic with me again

909
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,913
and I will stuff so much cotton wool
down your fucking throat

910
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:36,600
it'll come out your arse
like the tail on a Playboy bunny.

911
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:40,349
I was led to believe
I was attending the war committee.

912
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,711
Yes, Assistant Secretary of State
Linton Barwick asked me to brief you

913
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:46,149
on the work of
the Future Planning Committee.

914
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,111
I'm away.

915
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,515
And here we are.
The fucking Vice President

916
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,551
has also graced us with his presence.

917
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,636
Give him a bottle of milk.

918
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,557
You didn't wake me up.

919
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:59,717
The thought crossed my mind,
but you just looked so sweet there.

920
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,637
You know, with the jet lag and all.

921
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,149
I don't know, I thought
you knew what you were doing.

922
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:07,113
Well, no. Obviously I didn't know
what I was doing, I was asleep.

923
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:10,038
That's how people walk through
windows, that's how that happens.

924
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,116
Hey, Liza? I've got another call

925
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:15,232
for you about the committee
from Senator Crudden's office.

926
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,316
Crudden? What is going on?

927
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,590
I mean, how did CNN
know about the committee?

928
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:23,349
Did Linton post, like,
an invite on Facebook or something?

929
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:26,950
Liza? Everyone is so hot for this paper,
I just wanted to let you know.

930
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,877
I'm about to run off another ten copies.

931
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,798
- Just stop.
- It's like a Harry Potter book,

932
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,639
if Harry Potter
made people really, really angry.

933
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:37,274
You're in hot water,
you're lobsterising.

934
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,960
Do you smell lobster?
Because I smell lobster.

935
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:43,152
Strong... bisque wafting this way.

936
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,157
How far would you go with Linton?

937
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,111
You freaky little stalker.

938
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:50,312
Downtown?
Or all the way up Brokeback Mountain?

939
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,715
Smells like bisque. Smells like bisque.

940
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:03,034
Where's the war committee?
I thought I was going.

941
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:05,993
Simon's going. I thought
you were doing your one-to-one?

942
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,599
Where the fuck is it happening?

943
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:10,359
It's in the State Department
on the seventh floor.

944
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,232
<i>- Malcolm?
- What?</i>

945
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:15,875
Do you like how I'm telling you
what's going on where you are?

946
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,514
Let me tell you what's going on
where you are, sweetheart.

947
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,234
A certain vinegar-faced,
manipulative cowbag is about

948
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,112
<i>to discover that she's out of a fucking...</i>

949
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:27,074
job. Fucking hung up, haven't you?
You fucking hoity-toity fucking...

950
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,509
Hey, buddy?
Enough with the curse words, all right?

951
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:32,359
Kiss my sweaty balls, you fat fuck.

952
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,514
- There's the grenade.
- I know, I'm looking at it.

953
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:40,916
He's got "Climb the mountain
of conflict" on his picture.

954
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,996
He's picked up on that?

955
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,996
I'm a bumper sticker.

956
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,997
Shit, there's Karen Clark.

957
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,838
Have a meeting, have a meeting.

958
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,990
What about the dialectic, as it spreads
across the different territories?

959
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,076
- Interesting dialectic...
- Oh, hi.

960
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,509
Hi. I'll see you at the committee.

961
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:03,676
We're just sorting out a bit of prep...

962
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,995
Very good, that's great.

963
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:09,157
- Liza. They're still here.
- I know. I told them where it was.

964
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,793
OK, let's go, let's go. Come on.

965
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:13,832
Quick, we've got to keep up
with them, now. Let's roll.

966
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:16,838
No, you can't say "let's roll",
they don't like it here.

967
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:20,669
That's just who asked to be in
on the committee, it's crazy.

968
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,268
- Yeah.
- Hello.

969
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:26,312
Are you joining us
or shall we see you there?

970
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:28,158
Oh, I'm so sorry. No, see you there.

971
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,953
I don't need to do any of the things

972
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,833
that you need to go in there to do,
so I'll just see you there.

973
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,916
- Toby, do you need to use the...?
- No, no, no.

974
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:38,838
- I don't need the restroom.
- All right, OK.

975
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,791
Yeah, they're insane.

976
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,751
Where is it?

977
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,711
I don't know. We can wait here.

978
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:49,196
Wait round here. When they come out,
we'll follow them again.

979
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,632
Plenty of room down the back.

980
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:03,231
We seem to be
overrun with insurgents, Bob, huh?

981
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,794
- There must have been a leak.
- Really, no kidding?

982
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:09,754
- Unbelievable!
- Is this the wrestling? Is that the ring?

983
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:11,279
There's General Miller.

984
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:15,598
I think it's best that we move,
reconvene to a bigger, a larger venue.

985
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:17,995
- If you follow my lead...
- Take an agenda.

986
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:20,554
Please take an agenda,
we want to stick to that.

987
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:24,559
This is a cluster fuck.
How did CNN know about this?

988
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:27,752
- Hold onto that one!
- Could you get Miller to sign it?

989
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:30,838
If we could do this
with a certain amount of energy.

990
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,791
Just this way, folks.

991
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,876
Moo!

992
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,950
Find a chair,
wherever you're comfortable.

993
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:44,513
More this way.

994
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,995
Excellent. I'm room meat again.

995
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:50,829
This is a massive abattoir
of room meat.

996
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:54,508
Just so you know,
Karen and I did not appreciate

997
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,756
having to skulk around
like Mulder and Scully

998
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,518
to find out about the committee.

999
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:01,677
Well, you're both here now, huh,
John and Yoko?

1000
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,358
We need to talk.

1001
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:06,233
How about my office,
12:30 tomorrow, huh?

1002
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,759
OK, off you go.

1003
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:10,155
- What do you mean?
- I've got this covered.

1004
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:13,670
Go and find the next thing. Talk to that
Chad boy, the boy from The Shining.

1005
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,119
He knows things.

1006
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:18,152
- Don't make me pump Chad.
- No, I'm making you pump Chad.

1007
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:20,635
Go on, it'll be easy-peasey
lemon-squeezy.

1008
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:25,276
No, it won't. It'll be difficult, difficult,
lemon difficult, that is what it'll be.

1009
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,595
Have a lovely afternoon.
Stop a war for me.

1010
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:31,508
So, welcome
to the somewhat engorged

1011
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:34,632
session of
the Future Planning Committee.

1012
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:37,354
Yes, Assistant Secretary, on point six,

1013
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:41,029
it feels like there's already been
an assumption that we're invading

1014
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:45,790
and don't you think that we should
discuss the practical implications?

1015
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:48,593
I mean, this is,
after all, the war committee.

1016
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,109
This is the Future Planning Committee.

1017
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:54,152
Well, unofficially,
it is called the war committee.

1018
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:57,636
Well, Karen, unofficially,
we can call anything whatever we want.

1019
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:02,311
I mean, unofficially, this is a shoe, but
it's not, Karen, it is a glass of water.

1020
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:05,512
And this is
the Future Planning Committee.

1021
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:08,393
Well, unofficially,
this appears to be bullshit.

1022
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:12,515
Hey.

1023
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,790
- What's all this?
- "Climb the mountain of conflict!"

1024
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:17,514
We're just choosing a font
for what looks appropriate.

1025
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:19,392
What about that font the SS used?

1026
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,511
Have you thought about
using that one?

1027
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:23,756
Er... well,
that obviously has bad connotations.

1028
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:25,677
Heavy metal?

1029
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,597
- No, the SS.
- Oh, right.

1030
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:37,036
Has a decision already been made,
in principle, to advocate invasion?

1031
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:39,310
I would refer you
to the recent comments

1032
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:44,150
of our colleague from the UK,
Mr Simon Foster, in that regard.

1033
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:48,717
Yes, I think that Mr Foster
would have something to say to that.

1034
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,993
I'm... I'm certainly hearing both sides.

1035
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:57,831
In England we have a saying
for a situation such as this,

1036
00:00:02,321 --> 00:00:05,791
which is that it's difficult, difficult...

1037
00:00:07,241 --> 00:00:09,152
...lemon difficult.

1038
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:15,994
You betcha. Huh?
I do think a consensus is forming.

1039
00:00:16,121 --> 00:00:19,511
No, No, it's not,
and you have no basis for saying that.

1040
00:00:19,641 --> 00:00:21,279
Karen, calm down.

1041
00:00:21,401 --> 00:00:24,120
Because we don't want you
to have another haemorrhage.

1042
00:00:27,881 --> 00:00:29,792
Linton! Linton!

1043
00:00:30,761 --> 00:00:33,514
Mr Tucker, isn't it?
Nice to see you again.

1044
00:00:33,641 --> 00:00:35,597
Are you fucking me about?

1045
00:00:37,801 --> 00:00:39,598
Is there a problem, Mr Tucker?

1046
00:00:39,721 --> 00:00:42,793
I've just come from a briefing
with a nine-year-old child.

1047
00:00:42,921 --> 00:00:45,560
You're talking about AJ.
AJ is one of our top guys.

1048
00:00:45,681 --> 00:00:48,434
He's a Stanton College Prep, Harvard.

1049
00:00:48,561 --> 00:00:50,199
One of the brightest and best.

1050
00:00:50,321 --> 00:00:53,154
Well, his briefing notes
were written in alphabetti spaghetti.

1051
00:00:53,281 --> 00:00:56,114
When I left, I nearly tripped up
over his fucking umbilical cord.

1052
00:00:56,241 --> 00:00:58,232
I'm sorry it troubles you
that our people

1053
00:00:58,361 --> 00:01:00,511
achieve excellence
at such an early age.

1054
00:01:00,641 --> 00:01:03,678
But could we just move on
to what's important here?

1055
00:01:03,801 --> 00:01:06,918
Now, I understand that
your Prime Minister has asked you

1056
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:12,673
to supply us with some, say,
fresh British intelligence, is that true?

1057
00:01:12,801 --> 00:01:16,032
Yeah, apparently, your fucking
master race of highly-gifted toddlers

1058
00:01:16,161 --> 00:01:18,391
- can't quite get the job done...
- All right.

1059
00:01:18,521 --> 00:01:21,115
...between breast feeds
and playing with their Power Rangers.

1060
00:01:21,241 --> 00:01:23,994
So, an actual grown-up
has been asked to fucking bail you out.

1061
00:01:24,121 --> 00:01:27,636
Ah, Minister. Thank you so much
for your support, we appreciate it.

1062
00:01:27,761 --> 00:01:30,912
And what did you say,
that "Climb the mountain of conflict"?

1063
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:34,636
- Right, that's terrific.
- It's quite complicated in terms of my...

1064
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:37,798
It's early days, my friend.
All roads lead to Munich.

1065
00:01:37,921 --> 00:01:40,515
"All roads lead to Munich"?
What the fuck does that mean?

1066
00:01:40,641 --> 00:01:43,713
I think it just means...
Actually, I don't know what it means.

1067
00:01:45,441 --> 00:01:48,194
You see that?
Pull that out, America deflates.

1068
00:01:48,321 --> 00:01:51,916
Yeah, very easy to mock. The closest
you'll come to getting one of those

1069
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:53,918
is buying a fucking Toblerone.

1070
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:56,509
I'll meet you in the car.
Come on, back to London.

1071
00:01:56,641 --> 00:01:58,472
So, what are we going back to

1072
00:01:58,601 --> 00:02:01,320
apart from a nice cup of tea
and some knife crime?

1073
00:02:01,441 --> 00:02:04,194
Constituency surgery in Northampton.

1074
00:02:04,321 --> 00:02:06,232
Oh, great.

1075
00:02:06,361 --> 00:02:08,192
Meeting my constituents.

1076
00:02:08,321 --> 00:02:12,109
It's like being Simon Cowell
but without the ability to say,

1077
00:02:12,241 --> 00:02:14,516
"Fuck off you're mental."

1078
00:02:23,081 --> 00:02:24,878
<i>It's stuck.</i>

1079
00:02:25,001 --> 00:02:27,196
<i>Simon, do you mind?</i>

1080
00:02:27,321 --> 00:02:30,757
If you just kick it at the bottom
really hard, that should do it.

1081
00:02:32,601 --> 00:02:35,479
I'm just going to go
and deal with that guttering.

1082
00:02:35,601 --> 00:02:37,557
We've just come back from America,
Roz.

1083
00:02:37,681 --> 00:02:40,673
Right. How was the President?

1084
00:02:40,801 --> 00:02:42,029
Good, actually. Yeah.

1085
00:02:43,161 --> 00:02:44,230
Good.

1086
00:02:46,561 --> 00:02:50,270
Oh, dear, how the mighty have fallen.
From White House to shitehouse.

1087
00:02:51,241 --> 00:02:54,551
Actually, mate, sorry, fuck this,
could you get under there?

1088
00:02:56,241 --> 00:02:58,152
- Is that any better?
- No.

1089
00:02:59,561 --> 00:03:03,315
This septic tank, if we didn't even know
it was there in the first place,

1090
00:03:03,441 --> 00:03:05,671
how come we're responsible for it now?

1091
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:07,678
I think what's causing the problem

1092
00:03:07,801 --> 00:03:10,634
is that it's not actually
a council septic tank.

1093
00:03:10,761 --> 00:03:13,878
- You should leave this to us now.
- Really?

1094
00:03:14,001 --> 00:03:16,595
Certainly, I'm completely on board.

1095
00:03:16,721 --> 00:03:18,473
- Is he?
- Thanks for coming in.

1096
00:03:18,601 --> 00:03:20,512
- All right?
- Right, yes, thank you.

1097
00:03:20,641 --> 00:03:22,472
- Thank you.
- Thanks very much.

1098
00:03:22,601 --> 00:03:24,000
Thanks.

1099
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:25,554
- Hello.
- Hello.

1100
00:03:25,681 --> 00:03:27,512
- Mr Foster.
- Call me Simon.

1101
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:29,438
- Right, OK.
- You've met Roz.

1102
00:03:29,561 --> 00:03:30,994
- I know I have.
- Lovely.

1103
00:03:31,121 --> 00:03:33,874
I'll keep it brief, I know you're
a busy man. There's a fellow there

1104
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:37,357
who wants to stop people talking
in foreign languages in shops.

1105
00:03:38,441 --> 00:03:40,511
Yeah. Well, this sometimes
can be a magnet

1106
00:03:40,641 --> 00:03:43,280
for people who are
slightly mentally dispossessed.

1107
00:03:45,921 --> 00:03:48,913
And also very sensible people,
like yourself, Paul.

1108
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:52,272
- Paul, why don't you just...
- Don't you fucking patronise me, mate.

1109
00:03:52,401 --> 00:03:56,917
Paul, why don't you
just outline the whole issue?

1110
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:58,838
Right, OK, I'll tell you again.

1111
00:03:58,961 --> 00:04:02,670
Your constituency side wall...

1112
00:04:02,801 --> 00:04:05,156
- Uh-huh.
- ...is falling down.

1113
00:04:05,281 --> 00:04:09,559
Your wall... is falling
into my mother's garden.

1114
00:04:09,681 --> 00:04:12,434
She tried to call the office,
but she was fobbed off.

1115
00:04:12,561 --> 00:04:15,678
Fobbed off by your people, because
she's not Lord Snooty in a posh car

1116
00:04:15,801 --> 00:04:17,632
or Madonna on a horse.

1117
00:04:17,761 --> 00:04:21,037
Well, that I... I find that sort of thing
incredibly irritating myself.

1118
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:25,154
It's a patch from London,
it's Karen Clark. Urgent.

1119
00:04:25,281 --> 00:04:28,159
- Hello? Sorry, I'm not here.
- Sorry, Paul.

1120
00:04:28,281 --> 00:04:30,511
- I have to take this.
- Am I being fobbed off?

1121
00:04:30,641 --> 00:04:31,630
Absolutely not.

1122
00:04:31,761 --> 00:04:34,673
What's the difference between
being fobbed off and what happened?

1123
00:04:34,801 --> 00:04:36,757
You won't be able to forget me, Simon.

1124
00:04:36,881 --> 00:04:38,314
What's going on there, Simon?

1125
00:04:38,441 --> 00:04:41,433
It's... It's departmental business.
It's about a wall.

1126
00:04:41,561 --> 00:04:43,517
<i>- Oh, Gaza?
- Uh-huh.</i>

1127
00:04:43,641 --> 00:04:46,030
I'm wondering where you were
in committee, Simon.

1128
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:49,437
I called for back-up and you sat there
like a dumb sack of shit.

1129
00:04:49,561 --> 00:04:52,598
Only maybe worse,
because, actually, on a molecular level,

1130
00:04:52,721 --> 00:04:54,871
shit is probably fizzling with energy.

1131
00:04:55,001 --> 00:04:57,561
I have to say, Karen, I do have
a clear strategy on this,

1132
00:04:57,681 --> 00:04:59,831
which is I'm playing...
playing the long game.

1133
00:04:59,961 --> 00:05:01,394
Still here, Simon.

1134
00:05:01,521 --> 00:05:04,797
They've bounced us into a short game,
and you just sat there like a...

1135
00:05:04,921 --> 00:05:07,560
What do you call it in England?
A wanker.

1136
00:05:07,681 --> 00:05:09,512
No, we don't call it that.

1137
00:05:09,641 --> 00:05:11,313
Paul. Paul.

1138
00:05:11,441 --> 00:05:14,239
Perhaps if I had a bomb strapped
to my chest, I'd get more attention.

1139
00:05:14,361 --> 00:05:16,352
He's mentioned the matter of a bomb.

1140
00:05:16,481 --> 00:05:19,632
I'm not going to let a bomb off,
I work for the National Trust.

1141
00:05:19,761 --> 00:05:21,991
How do I know
you're not going to let a bomb off?

1142
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:26,990
Listen, Paul, why don't I give
you, the details of my cell

1143
00:05:27,121 --> 00:05:29,635
- so that you...
- Mobile phone details.

1144
00:05:29,761 --> 00:05:32,355
- Mobile phone details.
- Have you got a mobile, Paul?

1145
00:05:32,481 --> 00:05:34,472
- Of course I've got a fucking mobile!
- Roz.

1146
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:35,795
What is wrong with you?

1147
00:05:35,921 --> 00:05:37,559
Five megapixels.

1148
00:05:37,681 --> 00:05:39,512
Can we see the wall?
Would that satisfy you?

1149
00:05:39,641 --> 00:05:42,519
- Well, it's a start.
- Friends again? Let's go and do it.

1150
00:05:42,641 --> 00:05:45,553
I'm not... not your friend,
and I'm not your friend.

1151
00:05:45,681 --> 00:05:47,478
Thank you.

1152
00:05:47,601 --> 00:05:49,114
That's a pleasure.

1153
00:05:49,241 --> 00:05:51,197
Thank you.

1154
00:05:52,201 --> 00:05:53,793
Done. I'm done, I'm done.

1155
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:56,310
- Thank you.
- Let's go have a good look at that wall.

1156
00:05:56,441 --> 00:05:59,638
Four more constituents. How many
do you think are going to be like that?

1157
00:05:59,761 --> 00:06:01,433
OK, hang on.

1158
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:05,998
Also the committee got leaked and
that leak came from your department.

1159
00:06:06,121 --> 00:06:09,909
<i>I want a head on a plate, to go.</i>

1160
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:14,351
You're not my boss. Er... fuck off!

1161
00:06:15,161 --> 00:06:17,231
You can't make me sack people.

1162
00:06:17,361 --> 00:06:19,158
Why does she want someone sacked?

1163
00:06:19,281 --> 00:06:21,237
Ah, she said there's a leak...

1164
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:25,431
The detail of the committee meeting
in America was made public.

1165
00:06:25,561 --> 00:06:28,029
There shouldn't have been
as many people there.

1166
00:06:28,161 --> 00:06:30,675
Right, and who does she want sacked?

1167
00:06:30,801 --> 00:06:33,554
- Somebody from our office.
- Right.

1168
00:06:33,681 --> 00:06:35,751
Let's forget it. Come on, next person.

1169
00:06:36,721 --> 00:06:39,474
- Could it have been Judy?
- Probably.

1170
00:06:41,921 --> 00:06:44,435
Judy, can you come
into my office, I need a word?

1171
00:06:44,561 --> 00:06:46,392
One second. Tobes, that's for you.

1172
00:06:46,521 --> 00:06:48,113
What is it?

1173
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,516
- It's that madman about the wall.
- The war?

1174
00:06:50,641 --> 00:06:52,996
Wall! Eugh.

1175
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:56,193
Will you please come into my office
so I can give you a bollocking?

1176
00:06:56,321 --> 00:06:58,437
- Yeah, OK, OK, what?
- Hello.

1177
00:06:58,561 --> 00:07:00,279
- Argh! Fucker!
- I want a word with you.

1178
00:07:00,401 --> 00:07:02,198
And you, Charlotte fucking Brontë.

1179
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:04,118
What can I do for you, Paul?

1180
00:07:04,241 --> 00:07:09,076
You know those buttresses
that you had put up for the wall?

1181
00:07:09,201 --> 00:07:10,919
They are utterly insubstantial

1182
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:13,714
to even the untrained eye,
and I'm looking at them.

1183
00:07:13,841 --> 00:07:15,752
And my eye's trained.

1184
00:07:15,881 --> 00:07:18,600
No, I get that, I do... I understand that.

1185
00:07:18,721 --> 00:07:21,281
If that wall collapsed
and my mother was in the greenhouse,

1186
00:07:21,401 --> 00:07:22,914
that could crush her to death.

1187
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:25,999
Do you know how old she is?
Tell the reporter how old you are.

1188
00:07:26,121 --> 00:07:27,270
I'm 60.

1189
00:07:27,401 --> 00:07:29,232
She's 60... You're not fucking 60!

1190
00:07:29,361 --> 00:07:32,671
If it's going in the newspaper, I'm 60.

1191
00:07:32,801 --> 00:07:35,998
Olivia Newton-John's 60 and she's not
on the fucking statins, is she?

1192
00:07:36,121 --> 00:07:38,999
- I didn't leak anything.
- Don't you fucking walk out on me.

1193
00:07:39,121 --> 00:07:41,510
- I'm just getting my tea.
- Let her get a cup of tea.

1194
00:07:41,641 --> 00:07:45,236
Could you just get your mum to stay
away from the wall for the time being?

1195
00:07:45,361 --> 00:07:47,477
She can't stay away,
she's got to water her plants.

1196
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:51,310
Could she maybe do it with a hose,
from a distance?

1197
00:07:51,441 --> 00:07:53,477
She's got a watering can!

1198
00:07:53,601 --> 00:07:54,920
Calm down, Paul, calm down.

1199
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,839
I'm not... I'm fucking Zen.

1200
00:08:00,241 --> 00:08:02,311
I've brought my nunchucks
if you need them, sir.

1201
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:04,193
See how the meeting goes.

1202
00:08:06,281 --> 00:08:08,192
12:30.

1203
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,277
Hold on. General?

1204
00:08:11,401 --> 00:08:15,713
Yeah... Secretary Linton Barwick
asked me to let you know

1205
00:08:15,841 --> 00:08:18,878
that his last meeting
looks like it's overrunning,

1206
00:08:19,001 --> 00:08:20,354
He sends his apologies.

1207
00:08:20,481 --> 00:08:21,800
When will he be here?

1208
00:08:21,921 --> 00:08:24,310
I don't have that information
at this moment.

1209
00:08:24,441 --> 00:08:26,079
What the fuck?

1210
00:08:26,201 --> 00:08:27,793
Huh?

1211
00:08:27,921 --> 00:08:30,674
- Did he stand me up?
- No, no, sir.

1212
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:33,873
- You're more than welcome to wait.
- Do you know what I'm going to do?

1213
00:08:34,001 --> 00:08:36,276
I'm going to take
a nice big shit on his desk,

1214
00:08:36,401 --> 00:08:39,120
just to let him know that I was here.
Is that OK with you?

1215
00:08:39,241 --> 00:08:41,516
I don't think he'd like that too much, sir.

1216
00:08:43,441 --> 00:08:47,150
You can wait. We have
some very interesting periodicals.

1217
00:08:47,281 --> 00:08:50,159
- There's um...
- Oh, yeah.

1218
00:08:59,001 --> 00:09:02,710
You want me to read a periodical
at this time of national crisis? Huh?

1219
00:09:02,841 --> 00:09:05,230
Sit here with my thumb up my ass
reading a paper?

1220
00:09:05,361 --> 00:09:08,876
Finding out what? Which little starlet
fucked some guy this week?

1221
00:09:09,001 --> 00:09:11,879
No, I wasn't suggesting that, sir.

1222
00:09:14,561 --> 00:09:16,074
Give this to your boss.

1223
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:19,190
Yeah.

1224
00:09:21,641 --> 00:09:23,552
Get out of my way.

1225
00:09:40,641 --> 00:09:43,633
Oh, my God. What's up?

1226
00:09:43,761 --> 00:09:45,672
Fucking Linton stood me up.

1227
00:09:45,801 --> 00:09:48,599
He's playing me
like a turkey stick on a bass drum.

1228
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:51,030
Do you know where he is?
He's playing squash.

1229
00:09:51,161 --> 00:09:53,800
With this little fucking twit?

1230
00:09:53,921 --> 00:09:56,640
No, not with... No, that's Chad.

1231
00:09:56,761 --> 00:10:00,834
He just carries that every day,
because he's hoping to play squash.

1232
00:10:00,961 --> 00:10:04,397
I was going to eat lunch in here. Can
you digest? Do you want some food?

1233
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,159
Oh, yes, I can digest, yes.

1234
00:10:06,281 --> 00:10:07,634
Chinese OK?

1235
00:10:07,761 --> 00:10:10,116
Why don't you order me
some little mammals?

1236
00:10:10,241 --> 00:10:12,994
A little bunny and a little puppy,
and a little cat,

1237
00:10:13,121 --> 00:10:16,113
so I can twist their fucking neck off
and drink their blood.

1238
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:17,799
My, my. All right.

1239
00:10:18,281 --> 00:10:21,432
While Foster jets around
at the taxpayers' expense,

1240
00:10:21,561 --> 00:10:24,758
his constituency wall is collapsing
and he doesn't give a shit.

1241
00:10:24,881 --> 00:10:26,394
It doesn't say that?

1242
00:10:26,521 --> 00:10:28,512
No. But it does say
"Wall-ace And Gromit".

1243
00:10:28,641 --> 00:10:30,791
Wall-ace, though.

1244
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:33,913
You're being portrayed as
the biggest twat in Northamptonshire.

1245
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:35,918
I've got bigger fish to fry, believe me.

1246
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:39,078
I'm giving this to somebody else.
Jamie!

1247
00:10:39,201 --> 00:10:41,396
Ah, the crossest man in Scotland.

1248
00:10:42,801 --> 00:10:44,632
Well, if it isn't Humpty Numpty.

1249
00:10:44,761 --> 00:10:46,558
What is this? Surround bollocking?

1250
00:10:46,681 --> 00:10:48,751
Hey, with due respect, I hadn't finished.

1251
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:51,793
If it isn't Humpty Numpty
sitting on top of a collapsing wall

1252
00:10:51,921 --> 00:10:54,879
like some clueless egg cunt.

1253
00:10:55,001 --> 00:10:56,320
Now, I'm finished.

1254
00:10:56,441 --> 00:10:58,272
Hi, Jamie, this is Toby.

1255
00:10:58,401 --> 00:11:01,791
Oh, um... Toby Rice, I'm Simon's aide.

1256
00:11:01,921 --> 00:11:04,993
Hi, Toby, Toby. Very pleased
to meet you. Please sit down.

1257
00:11:05,121 --> 00:11:08,113
Now, right, that's enough of all
the fucking Oxbridge pleasantries.

1258
00:11:08,241 --> 00:11:11,677
- What's Oxbridge about saying hello?
- Shut it, Love Actually!

1259
00:11:11,801 --> 00:11:13,632
Do you want me
to hole punch your face?

1260
00:11:13,761 --> 00:11:16,719
Right, I'm off to deal
with the fate of the planet.

1261
00:11:16,841 --> 00:11:18,672
Be gentle with them.

1262
00:11:18,801 --> 00:11:22,316
Oh, you know me, Malc. Kid gloves...
but made from real kids.

1263
00:11:23,361 --> 00:11:26,194
Right, Butch and Gaydance,
this wall story is playing badly.

1264
00:11:26,321 --> 00:11:28,277
There's a cartoon
of you in here as a walrus.

1265
00:11:28,401 --> 00:11:30,312
A walrus?

1266
00:11:30,441 --> 00:11:32,796
I'm not fat,
I don't even have a moustache.

1267
00:11:33,761 --> 00:11:35,513
Fuck, they've given me tusks.

1268
00:11:35,641 --> 00:11:37,472
- Wal-rus.
- Yes, I know.

1269
00:11:37,601 --> 00:11:39,080
You get it? Wal-rus, wal-rus.

1270
00:11:39,201 --> 00:11:42,671
We called some builders. They didn't
turn up when they said they would.

1271
00:11:42,801 --> 00:11:44,598
What did you expect?

1272
00:11:44,721 --> 00:11:46,359
They're builders!

1273
00:11:46,481 --> 00:11:49,917
Have you ever seen a film
where the hero is a builder?

1274
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:53,397
No, no, because they never
fucking turn up in the nick of time.

1275
00:11:53,521 --> 00:11:55,398
Bat-builder? Spider-builder? Huh?

1276
00:11:55,521 --> 00:11:58,797
That's why you never see
a superhero with a hod.

1277
00:11:58,921 --> 00:12:01,071
You know, my theory
is Malcolm built him in a lab

1278
00:12:01,201 --> 00:12:03,192
out of bits of old psychopath.

1279
00:12:03,321 --> 00:12:04,993
Hello, ladies.

1280
00:12:05,121 --> 00:12:07,191
OK, well,
I'm just going to go to the bar.

1281
00:12:07,321 --> 00:12:09,118
Good idea, we're on the Sancerre.

1282
00:12:09,241 --> 00:12:12,233
- If you can afford that.
- If you can get served at the bar.

1283
00:12:12,361 --> 00:12:15,319
- Yes, thank you, Oscar Wilde.
- He might not get served, bless him.

1284
00:12:15,441 --> 00:12:17,397
Toby's got a message. Hang on.

1285
00:12:20,001 --> 00:12:21,753
What's that?

1286
00:12:22,881 --> 00:12:25,873
- Oh, fucking wow, I don't believe it.
- What?

1287
00:12:26,001 --> 00:12:28,561
I don't fucking... I don't believe it,
he's done it again.

1288
00:12:29,681 --> 00:12:32,195
Little shit, he's such a shit.

1289
00:12:33,721 --> 00:12:35,200
What?

1290
00:12:36,201 --> 00:12:37,520
- Here he is.
- There you are.

1291
00:12:37,641 --> 00:12:39,871
The finest Sancerre
in the Westminster reach.

1292
00:12:40,001 --> 00:12:42,913
So, this Liza, you shagged her, yeah?

1293
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,269
What? No.

1294
00:12:44,401 --> 00:12:47,438
Were you aware he was ball-deep
in some Washington wonk?

1295
00:12:47,561 --> 00:12:49,995
- Suzy!
- I didn't know anything about his balls.

1296
00:12:50,121 --> 00:12:53,477
Can we not discuss my balls
and accusations in...

1297
00:12:53,601 --> 00:12:56,991
Just tell me why. Huh?

1298
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:03,991
I don't know, Suzy. It was very weird
over there, very intense.

1299
00:13:04,121 --> 00:13:05,076
Right.

1300
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:09,638
Maybe, I don't know,
on some level, subconsciously,

1301
00:13:09,761 --> 00:13:14,198
it was like a... it was just...
it was a last-ditch attempt to...

1302
00:13:15,201 --> 00:13:19,991
...stop this... awful war, you know?

1303
00:13:21,561 --> 00:13:24,234
Just on a... I mean, you know,
I don't mean, obviously, to try...

1304
00:13:24,361 --> 00:13:26,192
- Wow.
- That's classic.

1305
00:13:26,321 --> 00:13:27,879
...to try and actually stop it.

1306
00:13:28,001 --> 00:13:30,515
Toby, did you just say
that you had sex to stop the war?

1307
00:13:30,641 --> 00:13:31,517
No, no, no.

1308
00:13:31,641 --> 00:13:35,680
An anti-war shag? Is that what you
thought, Toby? Because, that's... Wow.

1309
00:13:35,801 --> 00:13:37,314
Can we just go and discuss this

1310
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:40,319
somewhere where there aren't
enormous children eating snacks?

1311
00:13:40,441 --> 00:13:44,150
He's got his little cannons
and he's got his little guns, and...

1312
00:13:45,361 --> 00:13:48,398
...this is the problem
with civilians wanting to go to war.

1313
00:13:48,521 --> 00:13:50,716
Once you've been there,
once you've seen it,

1314
00:13:50,841 --> 00:13:53,799
you never want to go again,
unless you absolutely fucking have to.

1315
00:13:54,921 --> 00:13:56,832
It's like France.

1316
00:13:58,161 --> 00:13:59,674
Is there anything besides this to eat?

1317
00:13:59,801 --> 00:14:02,679
Have something else.
This has got a little protein, have that.

1318
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:04,678
What's this, fish ass?

1319
00:14:04,801 --> 00:14:07,759
- So, you read Liza's paper, I guess?
- Yeah,

1320
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:09,917
I'm a voracious reader.

1321
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:12,430
I am the Gore Vidal of the Pentagon.

1322
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:13,516
Gore's gay.

1323
00:14:13,641 --> 00:14:14,517
No, he's not.

1324
00:14:14,641 --> 00:14:16,438
I beg to differ, but...

1325
00:14:16,561 --> 00:14:19,678
He's gay? Because I've been saying
that Gore Vidal line.

1326
00:14:19,801 --> 00:14:21,075
He is gay.

1327
00:14:22,121 --> 00:14:24,077
Guess, I'd better stop saying that, then.

1328
00:14:24,201 --> 00:14:25,714
It's ridiculous.

1329
00:14:25,841 --> 00:14:28,878
The case against war
is far stronger than the case for war

1330
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:31,231
and the case for war
is caveated all to hell.

1331
00:14:31,361 --> 00:14:33,397
"Most analysts
believe the state is looking

1332
00:14:33,521 --> 00:14:35,910
to expand aggressively
beyond its borders."

1333
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,509
Then you look down the caveats.
"The only source is "Ice Man".

1334
00:14:38,641 --> 00:14:41,872
A possible alcoholic" - he probably does
ten bags of methamphetamine a day.

1335
00:14:42,001 --> 00:14:43,150
The Ice Man.

1336
00:14:43,281 --> 00:14:44,919
If he even exists.

1337
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:49,080
"The INR says we can't trust him."
We're disputing our own intelligence.

1338
00:14:49,201 --> 00:14:50,998
We should leak this, you know.

1339
00:14:51,121 --> 00:14:52,395
When do you wanna leak it?

1340
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:54,590
Me?

1341
00:14:54,721 --> 00:14:56,916
- Isn't that what you were suggesting?
- No.

1342
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:58,872
You don't have to say
that it came from you.

1343
00:14:59,001 --> 00:15:00,992
No, I'm not leaking it.

1344
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:04,997
Liza looks good today.

1345
00:15:09,601 --> 00:15:12,911
- I mean, has Linton read this thing?
- I don't think Linton reads.

1346
00:15:16,921 --> 00:15:19,355
Why don't you give it
a couple of weeks to settle down?

1347
00:15:19,481 --> 00:15:22,314
Oh, great, just what we need.
Old Anti-war Fuck is back.

1348
00:15:22,441 --> 00:15:25,114
- What the fuck's Cocoon doing here?
- What are you doing here?

1349
00:15:25,241 --> 00:15:27,675
- Well, I live here.
- Well, you don't, actually, Toby.

1350
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:30,873
- Want another cup of tea, Michael?
- Yes, please. I'd love one.

1351
00:15:31,001 --> 00:15:33,515
OK, right, I'm taking
all my stuff from the kitchen.

1352
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,393
- Do you want me to go?
- No, you stay there.

1353
00:15:35,521 --> 00:15:38,035
He's just getting his brie
and his peri-peri.

1354
00:15:38,161 --> 00:15:40,880
- Do you want me to help him pack?
- And certainly my quince paste.

1355
00:15:41,001 --> 00:15:42,832
Quince paste, he's such a prick.

1356
00:15:42,961 --> 00:15:45,111
Just going to gather up his shit clothes.

1357
00:15:45,241 --> 00:15:46,390
Shut up.

1358
00:15:48,441 --> 00:15:51,080
That's not how you fold them.

1359
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:54,318
I'm not going to fucking Fiji,
I'm getting chucked out of my house.

1360
00:15:54,441 --> 00:15:56,272
They're all going in bin liners.

1361
00:15:56,401 --> 00:15:58,551
It makes all the difference
at the other end.

1362
00:15:58,681 --> 00:16:01,070
There is no other end, that's the point.

1363
00:16:01,201 --> 00:16:03,351
- Has she got big tits?
- Oh, Christ alive.

1364
00:16:03,481 --> 00:16:05,870
Yes, actually, she has.
She's got massive tits. Yes.

1365
00:16:06,001 --> 00:16:08,834
Look them up on Google Earth.
They've got their own postcode.

1366
00:16:08,961 --> 00:16:11,077
They're so enormous
that they actually

1367
00:16:11,201 --> 00:16:13,237
suck in other tits
from the surrounding area.

1368
00:16:13,361 --> 00:16:15,317
Like you?

1369
00:16:17,841 --> 00:16:19,479
Thanks. See you, then.

1370
00:16:19,601 --> 00:16:21,239
OK.

1371
00:16:21,361 --> 00:16:22,999
Um...

1372
00:16:23,121 --> 00:16:27,512
Suzy, this is probably going to sound a
bit odd under the circumstances, but...

1373
00:16:27,641 --> 00:16:29,120
A quickie?

1374
00:16:29,241 --> 00:16:32,392
No. Thank you, but no.

1375
00:16:32,521 --> 00:16:34,751
It's about Liza.

1376
00:16:34,881 --> 00:16:36,997
Liza wrote a paper, it's called PWIP PIP.

1377
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:38,998
- PWIP what?
- PWIP PIP.

1378
00:16:39,121 --> 00:16:41,635
Who wrote that? Charles Dickens?

1379
00:16:41,761 --> 00:16:44,559
- Post War Planning Implications...
- Yeah, all right.

1380
00:16:44,681 --> 00:16:48,879
Right. I think, it could, if it was leaked,
stop this kind of rush towards a war,

1381
00:16:49,001 --> 00:16:51,151
you know, too quickly, that sort of thing.

1382
00:16:51,281 --> 00:16:54,512
- Just if it was leaked.
- You are such a coward.

1383
00:16:54,641 --> 00:16:58,634
Take your backlog of Mojo
and your shit clothes,

1384
00:16:58,761 --> 00:17:01,559
and your eighth of dope
and your flute and piss off.

1385
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:05,794
OK, I'll just leave it there.

1386
00:17:12,241 --> 00:17:14,675
- I need advice myself.
- Let's take care of the car.

1387
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:17,520
This should not be here.
This should not be here.

1388
00:17:17,641 --> 00:17:19,597
Sir. Everyone.

1389
00:17:20,241 --> 00:17:22,675
- The car is ready?
- All taken care of, sir.

1390
00:17:22,801 --> 00:17:25,520
- I'm handling travel.
- Why are people running around?

1391
00:17:25,641 --> 00:17:27,472
This had better be a fucking fire drill.

1392
00:17:27,601 --> 00:17:31,799
The President just announced he's
vetoing tariffs on Chinese auto imports.

1393
00:17:31,921 --> 00:17:34,151
That means, right,
he's buttering the Chinese up?

1394
00:17:34,281 --> 00:17:37,876
That he needs the Chinese to at least
abstain on the Security Council.

1395
00:17:38,001 --> 00:17:39,798
OK, so we're going to the UN.

1396
00:17:39,921 --> 00:17:42,799
- Yes, we're going to the UN.
- Shit.

1397
00:17:42,921 --> 00:17:44,877
Why didn't you tell me, Liza?

1398
00:17:45,881 --> 00:17:47,473
Since I created the budget deficit,

1399
00:17:47,601 --> 00:17:50,513
the President doesn't tend
to run things by me any more.

1400
00:17:50,641 --> 00:17:52,996
Don't get funny with me.
I am not in the mood to joke.

1401
00:17:53,121 --> 00:17:55,316
I'm... I'm getting that.

1402
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:59,434
If you say we're leaving in ten minutes
that means we're leaving right now.

1403
00:17:59,561 --> 00:18:02,553
Not that I don't trust you,
but I don't trust you.

1404
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:04,319
I am gonna go into Linton's office

1405
00:18:04,441 --> 00:18:06,909
and I'm gonna pull the little pin
on that fucking grenade.

1406
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:08,759
- Don't do that.
- I'm fucking joking.

1407
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:09,870
I'm not gonna do that.

1408
00:18:10,001 --> 00:18:11,832
We have an elevator waiting for us.

1409
00:18:11,961 --> 00:18:14,156
Good. Step in,
thank you very much, just...

1410
00:18:14,281 --> 00:18:16,237
I just...

1411
00:18:17,201 --> 00:18:19,999
This job is incredibly stressful,
you know that?

1412
00:18:20,121 --> 00:18:22,681
Simon, you're not a lion tamer,

1413
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:25,554
you're not a snooker player.

1414
00:18:25,681 --> 00:18:28,320
I don't want to back a war, Judy.

1415
00:18:29,481 --> 00:18:33,713
Look, put some hints out there,
put some nods and some winks out

1416
00:18:33,841 --> 00:18:38,119
that I'm toying with resignation, OK?
See if the PM reacts.

1417
00:18:38,241 --> 00:18:41,074
- You want me to put out some winks?
- And nods, yeah.

1418
00:18:41,201 --> 00:18:42,839
What? Big nods?

1419
00:18:42,961 --> 00:18:45,236
No, no, just sort of...
that sort of size nod.

1420
00:18:45,361 --> 00:18:46,350
OK.

1421
00:18:46,481 --> 00:18:48,119
No, no, that's much too big.

1422
00:18:48,241 --> 00:18:51,551
I'm just nodding normally to say
I understand the need for a small nod.

1423
00:18:51,681 --> 00:18:53,273
Oh, yeah. No, no, sorry, yeah.

1424
00:18:54,241 --> 00:18:57,438
All right now, my lovely friends,
the bottom line is...

1425
00:18:57,561 --> 00:18:59,677
Oh, God, I hate that phrase.
"Bottom line."

1426
00:18:59,801 --> 00:19:01,234
I mean, we're not in retailing.

1427
00:19:01,361 --> 00:19:03,750
Sorry. Michael's quite right.
I won't use that again.

1428
00:19:03,881 --> 00:19:06,076
The bottom line is the President
is going to the UN.

1429
00:19:06,201 --> 00:19:09,034
This will be the vote to commence
military intervention.

1430
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:13,274
And the Prime Minister has decided
that we should join him.

1431
00:19:13,401 --> 00:19:14,914
Rob, Innis,

1432
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:17,999
Little Bo Cock Jockey
and the Leakey Fucking Mingebox,

1433
00:19:18,121 --> 00:19:19,634
go back to your desks

1434
00:19:19,761 --> 00:19:21,592
and prepare to start briefing now.

1435
00:19:21,721 --> 00:19:23,757
Michael, do you mind
if we use your office?

1436
00:19:23,881 --> 00:19:25,360
- What?
- For a couple of minutes?

1437
00:19:25,481 --> 00:19:28,393
Yeah. Michael, sorry. Bottom line
is, can you come out again?

1438
00:19:28,521 --> 00:19:31,274
Um... might need to turn the music off.

1439
00:19:31,401 --> 00:19:32,390
Yes.

1440
00:19:33,441 --> 00:19:34,794
- Right.
- OK.

1441
00:19:34,921 --> 00:19:36,877
So, this is all going to spin along
from here.

1442
00:19:37,001 --> 00:19:38,673
We're going to have a vote
and go to war.

1443
00:19:38,801 --> 00:19:41,520
We'll fight people, kill them.
Our children will get killed.

1444
00:19:41,641 --> 00:19:43,120
This is exactly the sort of thing

1445
00:19:43,241 --> 00:19:45,801
that I didn't want to do
when I went into politics.

1446
00:19:45,921 --> 00:19:48,389
This is the opposite
of what I wanted to be doing.

1447
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:51,194
That's why you have to stay
in Government, to influence things.

1448
00:19:51,321 --> 00:19:53,710
In here, you can influence things,
you can delay things.

1449
00:19:53,841 --> 00:19:55,160
Out there, you're just another

1450
00:19:55,281 --> 00:19:58,432
mouthy, shouty mad fucker who people
don't want to make eye contact with.

1451
00:19:58,561 --> 00:20:01,394
Remember Mary? Remember what
happened? She took a stand on health.

1452
00:20:01,521 --> 00:20:03,273
Everybody decided
that she was mental.

1453
00:20:03,401 --> 00:20:05,119
Because The Sun
showed a picture of her

1454
00:20:05,241 --> 00:20:07,072
with wide eyes and her head on a cow.

1455
00:20:07,201 --> 00:20:09,510
I happened to find that a particularly
powerful image.

1456
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:12,314
Look... the Prime Minister
of this country,

1457
00:20:12,441 --> 00:20:14,318
he's not a fucking Viking, is he?

1458
00:20:14,441 --> 00:20:15,920
He doesn't drink blood.

1459
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:17,713
He doesn't go around biting tramps.

1460
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:20,560
I know the Prime Minister
isn't a Viking, Malcolm.

1461
00:20:20,681 --> 00:20:23,195
Unlike me,
he abhors physical violence.

1462
00:20:23,321 --> 00:20:25,551
Where is the intelligence,
the hard evidence?

1463
00:20:25,681 --> 00:20:27,637
We have got the fucking intelligence.

1464
00:20:27,761 --> 00:20:30,355
- I haven't seen it.
- The intelligence we've got is so deep,

1465
00:20:30,481 --> 00:20:32,995
so fucking hard,
it'll fucking puncture your kidneys.

1466
00:20:34,081 --> 00:20:35,480
Where's it coming from?

1467
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:37,432
There is an informant.

1468
00:20:37,561 --> 00:20:38,835
Ice Man.

1469
00:20:39,601 --> 00:20:40,875
Ice Man?

1470
00:20:41,681 --> 00:20:44,320
I don't name them. Ice Man. Yeah.

1471
00:20:44,441 --> 00:20:47,035
And the fact is,
the stuff that he's given us is...

1472
00:20:47,161 --> 00:20:48,719
I've seen it.

1473
00:20:48,841 --> 00:20:51,275
It would make your blood run cold

1474
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:55,113
and clot and turn your insides
into fucking black puddings,

1475
00:20:55,241 --> 00:20:57,038
but certain box lickers

1476
00:20:57,161 --> 00:20:59,516
are sitting on it,
but you're going to see it,

1477
00:20:59,641 --> 00:21:01,472
because the PM regards you

1478
00:21:01,601 --> 00:21:03,319
as a key player in this now.

1479
00:21:03,441 --> 00:21:06,797
Simon, the Prime Minister wants
to speak to you in ten minutes.

1480
00:21:06,921 --> 00:21:08,718
He wants you to go to the UN.

1481
00:21:08,841 --> 00:21:09,717
OK.

1482
00:21:09,841 --> 00:21:11,433
See? You're on the A list now.

1483
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:14,234
You're there in the VIP lounge.
You're a fucking Kennedy.

1484
00:21:14,361 --> 00:21:15,430
Yeah, Malcolm...

1485
00:21:15,561 --> 00:21:17,677
You've got the gold card,
the complimentary drinks,

1486
00:21:17,801 --> 00:21:19,120
the fucking hard on.

1487
00:21:19,241 --> 00:21:22,313
Show me the evidence -
my bottom fucking line.

1488
00:21:22,441 --> 00:21:24,079
Don't you start, as well.

1489
00:21:27,441 --> 00:21:28,840
Should I resign?

1490
00:21:29,801 --> 00:21:33,840
I floated that I might, then I thought I
wouldn't, so it'll look convincing if I did.

1491
00:21:35,001 --> 00:21:38,073
I mean, do you think,
is it braver to just resign

1492
00:21:38,201 --> 00:21:40,157
and say, "No. No war"?

1493
00:21:41,121 --> 00:21:42,474
- Yes.
- Or...

1494
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:44,080
is it braver...

1495
00:21:45,241 --> 00:21:46,879
...to say, "I don't agree",

1496
00:21:47,001 --> 00:21:49,071
and just grit my teeth
and get on with it?

1497
00:21:49,201 --> 00:21:50,156
No.

1498
00:21:50,281 --> 00:21:53,671
Is the really brave thing
actually doing what you don't believe?

1499
00:21:53,801 --> 00:21:54,631
No.

1500
00:21:54,761 --> 00:21:56,080
Maybe.

1501
00:21:56,201 --> 00:21:57,429
Because...

1502
00:21:57,561 --> 00:22:00,917
What's actually brave
about doing the right thing?

1503
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:01,917
Nothing.

1504
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:03,997
You know, doing the wrong thing is...

1505
00:22:04,121 --> 00:22:05,395
is... is braver,

1506
00:22:05,521 --> 00:22:07,113
in a way, isn't it?

1507
00:22:08,081 --> 00:22:10,675
And wars do sometimes work.

1508
00:22:11,761 --> 00:22:13,035
That erm...

1509
00:22:13,161 --> 00:22:14,992
the War for Independence.

1510
00:22:15,121 --> 00:22:17,840
You know, that worked
for the Americans, didn't it?

1511
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:19,360
And... erm...

1512
00:22:21,201 --> 00:22:22,998
The Second World War.

1513
00:22:23,121 --> 00:22:26,079
I know, it's not...
It wasn't a good idea, millions died.

1514
00:22:26,201 --> 00:22:27,759
No, no, I know what you mean.

1515
00:22:27,881 --> 00:22:30,076
The Crimean War.
We got nurses out of that.

1516
00:22:30,201 --> 00:22:32,032
- Nurses are good.
- Yes. Exactly.

1517
00:22:32,161 --> 00:22:34,117
So, right, well, no, exactly.

1518
00:22:37,521 --> 00:22:38,476
So...

1519
00:22:39,881 --> 00:22:41,599
You're not resigning?

1520
00:22:46,401 --> 00:22:48,915
In the motorcade, can we get
a car without Judy, please?

1521
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:50,997
You want hookers?
You like hooky fucky, sir?

1522
00:22:51,121 --> 00:22:52,395
No, I don't want...

1523
00:22:52,521 --> 00:22:54,830
- I want to talk about resigning.
- What again?

1524
00:22:54,961 --> 00:22:56,917
Yes, but with you and not her.

1525
00:23:01,841 --> 00:23:05,675
So, the wires are all currently reporting
that you're going to resign over the war.

1526
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,712
What? That's not supposed
to get outside.

1527
00:23:07,841 --> 00:23:11,595
Well, it is outside. It's lurking outside,
like a big hairy rapist at a coach station.

1528
00:23:13,001 --> 00:23:15,993
Do you know, if I could,
I'd fucking punch you into paralysis.

1529
00:23:19,761 --> 00:23:22,321
<i>So, you must be Simon.
I'm the British Ambassador to the UN,</i>

1530
00:23:22,441 --> 00:23:23,874
Sir Jonathon Tutt.

1531
00:23:24,001 --> 00:23:27,118
Well, this is it, ladies and gentlemen.
This is the United Nations.

1532
00:23:27,241 --> 00:23:29,277
We, sir, are in here.

1533
00:23:29,401 --> 00:23:32,154
So, if there's anything you need,
just give me a whistle.

1534
00:23:32,281 --> 00:23:34,431
You know how to do that, don't you?
What do you do?

1535
00:23:34,561 --> 00:23:37,837
Hm? That's right. You put your lips
together and you blow.

1536
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:41,310
I'm going to head up to
this delegates' reception.

1537
00:23:41,441 --> 00:23:44,194
I hope there's some nibbles,
because I'm ravenous.

1538
00:23:46,081 --> 00:23:47,912
Nibbles. Who still says "nibbles"?

1539
00:23:48,041 --> 00:23:51,113
Fuck the nibbles.
What was with the homoerotic tension?

1540
00:23:51,241 --> 00:23:54,790
OK. Your phone is off,
but there's been a catastrofuck here.

1541
00:23:54,921 --> 00:23:57,913
Someone's leaked Liza Weld's
PWIP PIP paper to the BBC.

1542
00:23:58,041 --> 00:23:59,759
Jesus Christ!

1543
00:24:00,761 --> 00:24:02,274
Ah, there we go.

1544
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:06,790
I reckon it's going to be on the six
o'clock news, one o'clock your time.

1545
00:24:06,921 --> 00:24:10,311
That is going to fucking fist
your UN vote to death.

1546
00:24:10,441 --> 00:24:11,351
Hey, you! Freeze!

1547
00:24:11,481 --> 00:24:13,836
Right. Missing you loads.
PWIP PIP toodle-oo.

1548
00:24:13,961 --> 00:24:15,792
I want a fucking word with you.

1549
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:17,479
OK, Jamie, two jobs.

1550
00:24:17,601 --> 00:24:21,230
Job one. Find the PWIP PIP leaker
and kill them. Job one has two parts.

1551
00:24:21,361 --> 00:24:24,353
Job two. Go to the BBC
and find out who's got it there.

1552
00:24:24,481 --> 00:24:26,995
We need them to delay
till after the vote. Yeah?

1553
00:24:27,121 --> 00:24:28,395
I love you.

1554
00:24:32,241 --> 00:24:34,311
Excuse me, I need a word with you.

1555
00:24:34,441 --> 00:24:36,432
Do not move from here
or I'll fucking stab you.

1556
00:24:36,561 --> 00:24:37,277
OK.

1557
00:24:37,401 --> 00:24:39,278
- Right. Was it you?
- No, it wasn't.

1558
00:24:39,401 --> 00:24:40,231
No. What?

1559
00:24:40,361 --> 00:24:42,352
- You know what I'm talking about.
- No.

1560
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,233
And... And... whatever it was,

1561
00:24:44,361 --> 00:24:46,192
I almost certainly didn't do it.

1562
00:24:46,321 --> 00:24:48,073
- You, the baby from Eraserhead?
- No, no.

1563
00:24:48,201 --> 00:24:49,873
Then it must be you,
woman from The Crying Game.

1564
00:24:50,001 --> 00:24:51,275
It wasn't me.

1565
00:24:51,401 --> 00:24:53,392
You've really got it in for me,
haven't you?

1566
00:24:53,521 --> 00:24:56,081
Listen, somebody has dropped
a bollock in the noodles here.

1567
00:24:56,201 --> 00:24:57,554
- And I reckon it was you.
- Oh.

1568
00:24:57,681 --> 00:24:59,911
- Nice logic.
- Yeah, no, that sounds possible.

1569
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:01,679
Will you just keep your nib out?

1570
00:25:01,801 --> 00:25:03,280
Psychologically speaking.

1571
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:05,278
- Springer spaniel head.
- It's plausible.

1572
00:25:05,401 --> 00:25:08,552
You might have built up a resentment
and paid it off in some underhand way.

1573
00:25:08,681 --> 00:25:10,399
That's a thing I've observed people do.

1574
00:25:10,521 --> 00:25:12,113
Observe that.

1575
00:25:12,241 --> 00:25:14,471
- Right, Baldermort.
- Bloody hell, Malcolm.

1576
00:25:14,601 --> 00:25:15,875
Excuse us.

1577
00:25:16,001 --> 00:25:17,719
We are in a new reality here.

1578
00:25:17,841 --> 00:25:18,910
- OK?
- Right.

1579
00:25:19,041 --> 00:25:21,396
And I need you to speed things up.

1580
00:25:21,521 --> 00:25:23,159
OK. Speed what up, Malcolm?

1581
00:25:23,281 --> 00:25:25,556
- The debate.
- Right.

1582
00:25:25,681 --> 00:25:28,878
I need you to bring it
from 1:30pm to 11 am.

1583
00:25:29,001 --> 00:25:33,074
Right. Let me tell you how the process
works here and why that's not possible.

1584
00:25:33,201 --> 00:25:36,159
Just fucking do it, otherwise you'll find
yourself in the Caucuses,

1585
00:25:36,281 --> 00:25:37,680
in a Medieval fucking war zone,

1586
00:25:37,801 --> 00:25:40,235
arse in the air, trying to persuade
men in balaclavas

1587
00:25:40,361 --> 00:25:44,036
that sustained sexual violence
is not the fucking way forward, OK?

1588
00:25:44,161 --> 00:25:47,312
It cannot be done and it will not
be done. There's an end to it.

1589
00:25:47,441 --> 00:25:48,874
Ok, I'll do it. Through here?

1590
00:25:49,001 --> 00:25:51,469
You will not do it
because that is a breach of protocol.

1591
00:25:51,601 --> 00:25:53,273
- Well, you do it.
- No, I will not do it.

1592
00:25:53,401 --> 00:25:55,551
- In there. Do it.
- I'm not dancing with you on this.

1593
00:25:55,681 --> 00:25:57,797
- Get through there and do it, now.
- I'm not.

1594
00:25:59,001 --> 00:26:00,150
Right... well...

1595
00:26:00,281 --> 00:26:01,919
Erm... everyone, if I could just...

1596
00:26:02,041 --> 00:26:03,235
Is this...

1597
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:04,794
Can you hear me?

1598
00:26:04,921 --> 00:26:07,879
I just wondered if we might er...
ask for a...

1599
00:26:09,521 --> 00:26:10,874
...a cheeky early vote,

1600
00:26:11,001 --> 00:26:13,276
a sort of a little bit of an adventure.

1601
00:26:13,401 --> 00:26:14,834
Yeah, we've got to plug that leak.

1602
00:26:14,961 --> 00:26:17,521
I don't know what else they've got
and where's this intel?

1603
00:26:17,641 --> 00:26:20,872
Are you sure you're working as hard
as me? I'm sweating spinal fluid here.

1604
00:26:21,001 --> 00:26:22,434
I'm a fucking husk.

1605
00:26:22,561 --> 00:26:23,755
Jesus.

1606
00:26:24,721 --> 00:26:27,758
- Got everything you need?
- Yeah. Yeah, thanks.

1607
00:26:27,881 --> 00:26:28,916
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1608
00:26:29,561 --> 00:26:30,630
General Flintstone.

1609
00:26:32,001 --> 00:26:33,354
Was it you?

1610
00:26:33,481 --> 00:26:35,472
Did you leak PWIP PIP?

1611
00:26:36,241 --> 00:26:39,119
I mean, I know you can't fire a gun,
but can you use a fax?

1612
00:26:39,241 --> 00:26:41,835
No, I didn't leak PWIP PIP.
I do everything up front. OK?

1613
00:26:41,961 --> 00:26:44,873
Not like some creepy little gay
mercenary that sneaks around

1614
00:26:45,001 --> 00:26:46,514
doing other people's dirty work.

1615
00:26:46,641 --> 00:26:48,233
Hey, I am doing my own work.

1616
00:26:48,361 --> 00:26:49,555
I'm doing my job.

1617
00:26:49,681 --> 00:26:51,592
No, you're doing Linton's dirty work.

1618
00:26:51,721 --> 00:26:53,552
You're his English bitch
and you don't even know it.

1619
00:26:53,681 --> 00:26:56,593
I bet if I went into your hotel room
tonight, I'd see you on all fours,

1620
00:26:56,721 --> 00:26:58,996
little fishnets on,
him hanging onto the back of you.

1621
00:26:59,121 --> 00:27:00,554
Oh, that's nice, that's nice.

1622
00:27:00,681 --> 00:27:03,434
That's tough talk coming from
a fucking armchair general.

1623
00:27:03,561 --> 00:27:06,280
Why don't you put your feet up
on a pouf and go back to sleep?

1624
00:27:06,401 --> 00:27:09,837
Tucker, you might be a scary little
poodle fucker, back there in London,

1625
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,235
but here you're nothing.

1626
00:27:11,361 --> 00:27:13,079
You know what you look like?

1627
00:27:14,041 --> 00:27:15,440
A squeezed dick.

1628
00:27:15,561 --> 00:27:18,837
You've got a little blue vein
running up the side of your head.

1629
00:27:18,961 --> 00:27:20,633
See, that's where I'd put the bullet.

1630
00:27:20,761 --> 00:27:24,390
But I'd have to stand back,
cos you look like you'd be a squirter.

1631
00:27:24,521 --> 00:27:26,159
Have you ever, even actually...

1632
00:27:27,121 --> 00:27:28,759
...killed anybody, I mean, really?

1633
00:27:28,881 --> 00:27:29,996
Yeah.

1634
00:27:30,761 --> 00:27:32,752
Falling asleep on someone.
That doesn't count.

1635
00:27:32,881 --> 00:27:34,519
That's good. That's good.

1636
00:27:34,641 --> 00:27:36,791
How about you, pussy drip,
ever kill anybody?

1637
00:27:36,921 --> 00:27:39,389
Maiming is what I prefer,
psychologically.

1638
00:27:39,521 --> 00:27:41,034
Why don't you try to maim me?

1639
00:27:41,161 --> 00:27:44,198
I'll hit you so hard in the face,
you'll be shitting teeth.

1640
00:27:45,201 --> 00:27:46,520
Go right ahead.

1641
00:27:46,641 --> 00:27:48,472
I can see the headlines right now.

1642
00:27:48,601 --> 00:27:52,071
"Peace-loving general starts fight
at the UN. Swiss intervene."

1643
00:27:52,201 --> 00:27:55,750
I don't know, I'm not an expert on spin,
but that could hurt your career.

1644
00:27:55,881 --> 00:27:56,711
Yeah?

1645
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:57,990
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1646
00:28:00,881 --> 00:28:02,234
Now, do excuse me.

1647
00:28:02,361 --> 00:28:03,919
I've got work to do.

1648
00:28:05,681 --> 00:28:07,876
Don't ever call me
fucking English again.

1649
00:28:11,961 --> 00:28:13,519
Suzy, well done.

1650
00:28:13,641 --> 00:28:15,279
This is absolutely superb.

1651
00:28:15,401 --> 00:28:17,631
Hey, horse of the year, was it you?

1652
00:28:17,761 --> 00:28:20,150
- Was what me?
- Answer the fucking question!

1653
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:21,350
Was it you?

1654
00:28:21,481 --> 00:28:24,439
Was what me, Jamie? I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1655
00:28:24,561 --> 00:28:28,156
She can't answer the question,
can she? Unless she knows what it is.

1656
00:28:28,281 --> 00:28:29,396
You...

1657
00:28:29,521 --> 00:28:32,558
leaked Liza Weld's paper
to the BBC, right?

1658
00:28:32,681 --> 00:28:35,354
Now, tell me you leaked it.

1659
00:28:36,801 --> 00:28:38,917
No, I didn't. I didn't leak it.

1660
00:28:39,041 --> 00:28:40,474
I know...

1661
00:28:40,601 --> 00:28:43,115
the leak came from in here.

1662
00:28:43,241 --> 00:28:44,720
From...

1663
00:28:44,841 --> 00:28:48,436
this fucking fax machine right here.

1664
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:50,995
No. There's no... There's no way.

1665
00:28:52,001 --> 00:28:53,195
Do you see...

1666
00:28:53,321 --> 00:28:54,993
what I'm doing to this machine?

1667
00:28:55,121 --> 00:28:56,679
- Jamie, don't.
- See?

1668
00:28:56,801 --> 00:28:58,154
Jesus Christ!

1669
00:28:58,281 --> 00:28:59,634
Fuck, Jamie.

1670
00:28:59,761 --> 00:29:02,480
You see how... angry I am with the...

1671
00:29:02,601 --> 00:29:07,152
piece of office equipment
that leaked this document?

1672
00:29:07,281 --> 00:29:08,157
Huh?

1673
00:29:08,281 --> 00:29:09,430
Michael.

1674
00:29:09,561 --> 00:29:14,476
Can you even imagine how angry I am
with the person who leaked it, can you?

1675
00:29:14,601 --> 00:29:17,513
- That's really... expensive, Jamie.
- Can you, Suzy?

1676
00:29:17,641 --> 00:29:19,871
Jamie, it was me.

1677
00:29:20,001 --> 00:29:22,993
Oh, don't come over
all fucking Spartacus on us now.

1678
00:29:23,121 --> 00:29:24,713
- I leaked it.
- What are you doing?

1679
00:29:24,841 --> 00:29:26,638
No, hang on, hang on. For a start...

1680
00:29:26,761 --> 00:29:28,638
turn that fucking racket off!

1681
00:29:28,761 --> 00:29:30,672
- Turn it off.
- It's just vowels.

1682
00:29:31,761 --> 00:29:34,798
Subsidised foreign fucking vowels.

1683
00:29:35,761 --> 00:29:39,276
The only reason you listen to this shit
is because it's bad form

1684
00:29:39,401 --> 00:29:41,676
to actually wear a hat that says,

1685
00:29:41,801 --> 00:29:43,598
"I went to private school."

1686
00:29:43,721 --> 00:29:45,200
So, tell me now, right.

1687
00:29:45,321 --> 00:29:47,551
- Who did you leak it to?
- I just sent it.

1688
00:29:47,681 --> 00:29:49,990
I read it, I thought it was important,
so I sent it.

1689
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:52,430
Good. Fine. See that fax?

1690
00:29:52,561 --> 00:29:53,437
Yes.

1691
00:29:53,561 --> 00:29:55,119
That is your career.

1692
00:29:55,881 --> 00:29:58,998
And I think it might be fucked,
but let's just check.

1693
00:29:59,921 --> 00:30:01,912
Yeah, yeah, it's pretty fucked.

1694
00:30:02,041 --> 00:30:03,997
Now, I hope you can play the spoons.

1695
00:30:04,121 --> 00:30:06,840
You're too old to go back
to being a gentleman's fluffer.

1696
00:30:08,081 --> 00:30:09,992
Simon? Simon.

1697
00:30:10,121 --> 00:30:12,794
Congratulations.
I didn't think you had it in you.

1698
00:30:12,921 --> 00:30:13,797
Hi.

1699
00:30:13,921 --> 00:30:15,877
- This is great, Simon.
- He's resigning.

1700
00:30:16,001 --> 00:30:17,992
- Have you seen it? It's a good picture.
- Oh.

1701
00:30:18,121 --> 00:30:20,396
- They're running with that?
- In a very big way.

1702
00:30:20,521 --> 00:30:22,113
I didn't say that.

1703
00:30:22,241 --> 00:30:23,117
What?

1704
00:30:23,241 --> 00:30:25,311
- What?
- You're not resigning?

1705
00:30:25,441 --> 00:30:27,272
Are you still playing the hawk?

1706
00:30:27,401 --> 00:30:30,552
In a way, it's... I'm playing a much
cleverer game than that.

1707
00:30:30,681 --> 00:30:31,830
I'm a...

1708
00:30:31,961 --> 00:30:33,679
I'm a fake hawk.

1709
00:30:34,641 --> 00:30:35,869
A what?

1710
00:30:36,681 --> 00:30:38,194
A fake hawk.

1711
00:30:39,681 --> 00:30:41,194
You're an idiot.

1712
00:30:42,241 --> 00:30:44,357
Or are you being a fake idiot?

1713
00:30:45,201 --> 00:30:49,194
<i>So, we float it, anyway, tell the press
that he confirmed to us he's resigning.</i>

1714
00:30:49,321 --> 00:30:50,993
- That's what we'll do, then.
- What?

1715
00:30:51,121 --> 00:30:53,681
- It's decided, then.
- Sorry. No, it bloody isn't.

1716
00:30:53,801 --> 00:30:55,154
I'm me. OK?

1717
00:30:55,281 --> 00:30:56,999
You're not me.

1718
00:30:58,001 --> 00:31:01,038
I decide about all the main things
about me.

1719
00:31:01,161 --> 00:31:02,799
- Not any more.
- Not you, me.

1720
00:31:02,921 --> 00:31:07,915
Simon, the only thing that we can do
to influence events now is to resign.

1721
00:31:08,041 --> 00:31:09,315
That's it, OK?

1722
00:31:09,441 --> 00:31:12,001
- Sacrifice ourselves.
- Like a suicide bomber?

1723
00:31:12,121 --> 00:31:15,716
No, not like suicide bomber.
A suicide bomber makes a decision.

1724
00:31:23,641 --> 00:31:25,199
Are you OK?

1725
00:31:26,561 --> 00:31:28,916
I'm thinking of becoming
a suicide bomber.

1726
00:31:29,841 --> 00:31:30,796
Right.

1727
00:31:31,761 --> 00:31:33,513
- Would you like a mint?
- No.

1728
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:38,351
They're really not that good
for the teeth, you know, rots them slowly.

1729
00:31:38,481 --> 00:31:40,437
- It's early.
- Do you like me, Judy?

1730
00:31:42,321 --> 00:31:44,710
Well... you're my boss, you know.

1731
00:31:44,841 --> 00:31:46,479
But do you really like me?

1732
00:31:48,241 --> 00:31:49,560
Yeah.

1733
00:31:50,641 --> 00:31:53,519
I'll... I'll just leave you to your thoughts.

1734
00:31:53,641 --> 00:31:54,471
OK?

1735
00:31:54,601 --> 00:31:56,557
I haven't got any thoughts.

1736
00:31:58,161 --> 00:32:00,311
I'm just staring vacantly into space.

1737
00:32:01,361 --> 00:32:03,829
While a distant voice
in the back of my head goes,

1738
00:32:03,961 --> 00:32:05,314
"Oh, shit",

1739
00:32:05,441 --> 00:32:07,750
like a car alarm,
in the middle of the night.

1740
00:32:09,561 --> 00:32:11,358
Why? Has Jamie been round?

1741
00:32:11,481 --> 00:32:13,836
- Because he's...
- This is you, isn't it?

1742
00:32:13,961 --> 00:32:17,431
Suzy, can I phone you back in a few
minutes for a further bollocking?

1743
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:19,199
I'll just deal with this one here.

1744
00:32:19,321 --> 00:32:22,393
I have got something really, really big
in my career lined up for me

1745
00:32:22,521 --> 00:32:24,876
and you're going to fuck it up
because of this leak.

1746
00:32:25,001 --> 00:32:26,832
What did you...?
What would be fucked up?

1747
00:32:26,961 --> 00:32:29,316
Chad, I don't need to tell you anything.

1748
00:32:29,441 --> 00:32:30,840
I want to tell you a story.

1749
00:32:30,961 --> 00:32:33,031
When the Titanic went down,
there were lifeboats.

1750
00:32:33,161 --> 00:32:36,278
They had extra room on them
and there were people in the water.

1751
00:32:36,401 --> 00:32:39,154
Some people on the boats just wanted
room to stretch their legs,

1752
00:32:39,281 --> 00:32:42,034
but people in the water froze
and that was on their conscience.

1753
00:32:42,161 --> 00:32:44,880
You talk entirely in parables.
You're like a crap Jesus.

1754
00:32:45,001 --> 00:32:47,754
Tread lightly. OK?
You are fucking with the wrong person.

1755
00:32:47,881 --> 00:32:50,315
- Oh, really?
- Yes. I've got this town on lockdown.

1756
00:32:50,441 --> 00:32:52,079
We're both and so...

1757
00:32:52,201 --> 00:32:53,839
- Fuck you all.
- A common enemy.

1758
00:32:53,961 --> 00:32:54,632
Hello.

1759
00:32:54,761 --> 00:32:55,637
Hello!

1760
00:32:55,761 --> 00:32:57,160
Hello, Paul.

1761
00:32:57,281 --> 00:33:00,830
<i>- Guess what's happened to my wall?
- Could you hold on just a second?</i>

1762
00:33:00,961 --> 00:33:03,270
The Vice President's... Doesn't matter.

1763
00:33:04,321 --> 00:33:06,152
Of America. Yes. That one.

1764
00:33:08,241 --> 00:33:11,074
So, we're getting a little close
to the wire, Mr Tucker.

1765
00:33:11,201 --> 00:33:12,873
Where is that intel, huh?

1766
00:33:13,001 --> 00:33:15,037
What sort of intel have you rustled up?

1767
00:33:15,161 --> 00:33:17,197
- Ah, the smoking intel?
- Yeah.

1768
00:33:17,321 --> 00:33:19,118
Well, honestly, I haven't got it.

1769
00:33:19,241 --> 00:33:21,072
You haven't got it?

1770
00:33:21,201 --> 00:33:22,793
All right. OK.

1771
00:33:22,921 --> 00:33:26,231
Well, then, can you delay the vote?
It'd give you the time to get it.

1772
00:33:26,361 --> 00:33:27,919
I've just had it brought forward.

1773
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:32,711
Sorry, I'm just erm... getting my mints.

1774
00:33:33,841 --> 00:33:36,116
I am telling you, delay the vote

1775
00:33:36,241 --> 00:33:41,361
and make yourself some time to get
the intel, because I need it, my friend.

1776
00:33:41,481 --> 00:33:43,437
Hey. OK.
Just a quick reality check here,

1777
00:33:43,561 --> 00:33:45,756
J Edgar Fucking Hoover,
I don't work for you.

1778
00:33:45,881 --> 00:33:47,997
You don't fucking tell me what to do.

1779
00:33:48,121 --> 00:33:50,476
OK. Firstly, don't raise your voice.

1780
00:33:50,601 --> 00:33:52,432
This is a sacred place.

1781
00:33:52,561 --> 00:33:55,553
Now, you may not believe that
and I may not believe that,

1782
00:33:55,681 --> 00:33:57,558
but, by God, it's a useful hypocrisy.

1783
00:33:57,681 --> 00:33:59,558
And, secondarily,

1784
00:33:59,681 --> 00:34:04,072
I believe your Prime Minister
has instructed you to work for me.

1785
00:34:05,681 --> 00:34:07,319
Take your sweeties and fuck off.

1786
00:34:08,281 --> 00:34:10,317
Oh, the great Malcolm Tucker.

1787
00:34:10,441 --> 00:34:13,194
One of your guys leaks a paper.
You can't do anything.

1788
00:34:13,321 --> 00:34:16,154
Huh? We tell you to get some intel.
You can't do anything.

1789
00:34:16,281 --> 00:34:19,239
I need you to move the vote back.
You can't do anything.

1790
00:34:19,361 --> 00:34:21,875
I am afraid you are nothing
but a useless piece of

1791
00:34:22,001 --> 00:34:24,356
S star-star T.

1792
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:27,318
What the fuck do you want?

1793
00:34:27,441 --> 00:34:28,794
Erm... sorry, I...

1794
00:34:28,921 --> 00:34:32,550
I've just heard that the constituency
wall has started to collapse.

1795
00:34:32,681 --> 00:34:35,878
A brick's fallen out. Well, that's
the news I'm getting, at the moment.

1796
00:34:36,001 --> 00:34:37,559
There'll be more to follow.

1797
00:34:37,681 --> 00:34:39,273
News and bricks.

1798
00:34:39,401 --> 00:34:42,632
My God, that sounds important.
Take care of that, Mr Tucker. Yes?

1799
00:34:42,761 --> 00:34:44,399
I think that's more your speed.

1800
00:34:44,521 --> 00:34:48,719
I can see you, with your shirt off and
a wheelbarrow, whistling a happy tune.

1801
00:34:48,841 --> 00:34:50,194
Get on that.

1802
00:34:54,481 --> 00:34:55,834
You work for him?

1803
00:34:56,881 --> 00:34:59,349
This is very fucking complicated stuff.

1804
00:34:59,481 --> 00:35:01,199
After the vote...

1805
00:35:02,161 --> 00:35:03,560
...I resign.

1806
00:35:03,681 --> 00:35:05,034
Oh, fuck off!

1807
00:35:05,161 --> 00:35:06,196
Resigning?

1808
00:35:06,321 --> 00:35:07,913
How fucking impressive!

1809
00:35:08,041 --> 00:35:12,000
Resign. The horse has bolted. It's out
there now. It's getting fucking shot!

1810
00:35:12,121 --> 00:35:13,679
I'll see you later, Malcolm.

1811
00:35:15,161 --> 00:35:16,230
You...

1812
00:35:16,361 --> 00:35:17,840
You repeat...

1813
00:35:17,961 --> 00:35:20,236
one word of what you have heard here

1814
00:35:20,361 --> 00:35:23,717
and I'm going to fucking
take your leg off... I'll fucking...

1815
00:35:25,441 --> 00:35:26,840
The shin bone.

1816
00:35:26,961 --> 00:35:30,351
I'm going to take the shin bone,
I'm going to break it in two

1817
00:35:30,481 --> 00:35:34,315
and I'm going to fucking stab you
to fucking death with it, right?

1818
00:35:34,441 --> 00:35:35,920
So, just... just...

1819
00:35:36,041 --> 00:35:37,269
go away.

1820
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:38,800
Go away.

1821
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:54,238
Hi. BBC News Desk, please.

1822
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:55,919
Malcolm Tucker.

1823
00:35:56,881 --> 00:35:58,200
Hi, Ben.

1824
00:35:58,321 --> 00:36:01,870
Listen, I hear that you might be
preparing a story that we might not like.

1825
00:36:02,001 --> 00:36:03,320
- Yeah, please.
- Ow!

1826
00:36:03,441 --> 00:36:07,116
I just wanted to say, please, this
garden-wall story, don't run with that.

1827
00:36:07,241 --> 00:36:08,117
Ow!

1828
00:36:08,241 --> 00:36:10,471
Simon Foster's constituency office wall.

1829
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:12,432
That's what you've got, haven't you?

1830
00:36:12,561 --> 00:36:15,155
Oh, shit. I haven't let the cat
out of the bag, have I?

1831
00:36:15,281 --> 00:36:18,353
Please, don't run with that.
My reputation will be in tatters.

1832
00:36:18,481 --> 00:36:20,472
- Ow!
- And he is gone!

1833
00:36:20,601 --> 00:36:22,637
My hand is really
quite badly scalded now.

1834
00:36:22,761 --> 00:36:25,673
I know it was you who leaked
Linton's war committee.

1835
00:36:25,801 --> 00:36:27,757
Oh. Right. Erm...

1836
00:36:29,681 --> 00:36:31,433
- It wasn't.
- It wasn't?

1837
00:36:31,561 --> 00:36:32,710
That's what you'll say

1838
00:36:32,841 --> 00:36:37,073
when they fly you to Diego Garcia
and carry out a cavity search?

1839
00:36:38,721 --> 00:36:40,313
I don't actually recall.

1840
00:36:40,441 --> 00:36:42,272
It was a very busy time.

1841
00:36:42,401 --> 00:36:43,914
That's better. OK.

1842
00:36:44,041 --> 00:36:46,316
I am putting you
on a probationary period

1843
00:36:46,441 --> 00:36:49,353
from today,
until the end of recorded time.

1844
00:36:49,481 --> 00:36:51,278
- All right.
- Do you understand?

1845
00:36:51,401 --> 00:36:53,039
- Yes.
- You're my guy now. Right?

1846
00:36:53,161 --> 00:36:57,234
I own you. You are my Kunta Kinte.
Go and get your fucking laptop.

1847
00:36:59,321 --> 00:37:02,757
Mr Ambassador, with your big, baldy
head, you are spoiling us! A word?

1848
00:37:02,881 --> 00:37:04,394
Excuse us, just for a second.

1849
00:37:04,521 --> 00:37:09,117
<i>I'm pleased to be able to tell you that,
by some huge effort on my behalf,</i>

1850
00:37:09,241 --> 00:37:13,029
I've brought your vote forward
by an hour and a half. Say "thank you".

1851
00:37:13,161 --> 00:37:15,994
- Great. Well, I need it delayed now.
- Very funny.

1852
00:37:16,121 --> 00:37:17,634
By an hour, at least.

1853
00:37:17,761 --> 00:37:21,470
<i>Well, actually, two and a half hours,
now that you've brought it forward.</i>

1854
00:37:21,601 --> 00:37:25,355
No. I will not put myself through that
humiliation again. I'm just not doing it.

1855
00:37:26,641 --> 00:37:29,792
Right.
What can I say? Erm...

1856
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:33,398
Ah, right, Frank and Nancy Sinatra.
I've got good news for you.

1857
00:37:33,521 --> 00:37:36,479
<i>You're not fired.
That's great news, isn't it?</i>

1858
00:37:36,601 --> 00:37:39,911
- Well, it sounds ominous.
- We want to get Liza Weld's PWIP PIP

1859
00:37:40,041 --> 00:37:43,431
out there properly,
in the public domain.

1860
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:45,438
We just need to refine it a bit.

1861
00:37:45,561 --> 00:37:47,552
- What do you want to refine?
- Just mess it up.

1862
00:37:47,681 --> 00:37:50,320
Move the paragraphs. Change
the name of the main informant.

1863
00:37:50,441 --> 00:37:53,877
- Well, that's a complete fabrication.
- Changing his name doesn't matter.

1864
00:37:54,001 --> 00:37:56,754
<i>Do you think
he's really called Ice Man? Huh?</i>

1865
00:37:56,881 --> 00:37:59,600
"To Mr and Mrs Man, a son... Ice."

1866
00:37:59,721 --> 00:38:02,793
So, change it to another name.

1867
00:38:02,921 --> 00:38:04,912
What's the name
of the fuck with the fiddle?

1868
00:38:05,041 --> 00:38:06,793
<i>- This happens to be Debussy.
- Debussy.</i>

1869
00:38:06,921 --> 00:38:09,993
- Well, we'll change it to Debussy, then.
- No, we will not!

1870
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,715
Now, your prints
are gonna be all over this, Michael,

1871
00:38:12,841 --> 00:38:15,480
but that's the only way
you can save your job, you leaky fuck.

1872
00:38:15,601 --> 00:38:17,319
- Don't make me do this.
- It wasn't him.

1873
00:38:17,441 --> 00:38:21,070
Somebody must have come in there
and used the fax machine.

1874
00:38:21,201 --> 00:38:22,998
- It could have been anyone.
- Fax machine?

1875
00:38:23,121 --> 00:38:26,079
Ah, no! Don't worry about that.

1876
00:38:26,201 --> 00:38:28,192
No, I made that up.

1877
00:38:28,321 --> 00:38:30,630
No, the document
was leaked by e-mail.

1878
00:38:30,761 --> 00:38:33,514
It's just, the fax machine was there,
and it's easier to kick.

1879
00:38:33,641 --> 00:38:35,836
Come on, Thick White Duke!

1880
00:38:35,961 --> 00:38:38,350
- Don't shout at...
- Come with me.

1881
00:38:38,481 --> 00:38:41,200
Right, OK. Is it up? Have you got it up?

1882
00:38:41,321 --> 00:38:42,800
Yeah, it's all fine.

1883
00:38:42,921 --> 00:38:45,230
<i>OK. Cut the top paragraph
and paste it into page 5.</i>

1884
00:38:45,361 --> 00:38:46,680
Right, yeah, we've done it.

1885
00:38:46,801 --> 00:38:49,076
Page 6 - get rid of the footnotes.

1886
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:50,270
Done.

1887
00:38:50,401 --> 00:38:52,631
<i>- Go to page 9.
- Go to page 9.</i>

1888
00:38:52,761 --> 00:38:55,480
Highlight from that page
to the end of the document.

1889
00:38:55,601 --> 00:38:58,161
- Go on, do it.
- The caveats?

1890
00:38:58,281 --> 00:39:00,749
- OK. Delete.
- Right, OK, we're doing it. Delete it.

1891
00:39:00,881 --> 00:39:04,351
You can't delete
the arguments against the war.

1892
00:39:04,481 --> 00:39:07,917
Oh. There's a shake of the head here,
Malc. I think he's crashed.

1893
00:39:08,041 --> 00:39:09,633
Give him a thump - that usually works.

1894
00:39:09,761 --> 00:39:11,638
Let me try
a wee bit of manual override.

1895
00:39:11,761 --> 00:39:15,595
<i>Let's see if it is possible to delete
the arguments against the war.</i>

1896
00:39:15,721 --> 00:39:18,360
<i>Hey! You could delete it, after all.
It's done.</i>

1897
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:20,392
Great. Now, attach that to an e-mail.

1898
00:39:20,521 --> 00:39:22,000
Yes, done it. Done it.

1899
00:39:22,121 --> 00:39:23,918
Let's find a printer.

1900
00:39:24,041 --> 00:39:26,509
- Right.
- The Japanese. They'll have a printer.

1901
00:39:27,481 --> 00:39:29,836
- Well, we can't just present it like this.
- No, we can't.

1902
00:39:29,961 --> 00:39:31,997
Go and get me a blue folder.

1903
00:39:32,121 --> 00:39:34,112
- Well, OK. Where from?
- I don't know.

1904
00:39:34,241 --> 00:39:38,154
I've never been in a fucking stationery
cupboard. I do my shagging in hotels.

1905
00:39:38,281 --> 00:39:40,237
Just take out all the conditionals.

1906
00:39:40,361 --> 00:39:44,752
<i>Like, "might" becomes... Instead of
"might have found", "have found". OK?</i>

1907
00:39:48,641 --> 00:39:51,235
Be audacious.
Just re-write the whole damn thing.

1908
00:39:52,561 --> 00:39:53,516
Ohh...

1909
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:56,075
Declarative sentences -
that's what I want.

1910
00:39:56,201 --> 00:39:57,998
- Take 'em all out.
- Linton, come here.

1911
00:39:58,121 --> 00:40:00,760
- What is it?
- The intel your guys couldn't find.

1912
00:40:00,881 --> 00:40:02,837
Yeah?

1913
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:10,712
I think that I am owed
a massive, grovelling apology.

1914
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:13,560
Congratulations, huh?

1915
00:40:13,681 --> 00:40:15,637
Maybe they'll give you a knighthood.

1916
00:40:16,601 --> 00:40:18,193
A pleasure doing business with you.

1917
00:40:18,321 --> 00:40:21,074
You know,
I've come across a lot of psychos...

1918
00:40:21,201 --> 00:40:24,318
<i>but none as fucking boring as you.</i>

1919
00:40:24,441 --> 00:40:27,353
I mean, you are a real, boring fuck.

1920
00:40:27,481 --> 00:40:30,678
- Sorry. I know you dislike swearing.
- No, that's all right.

1921
00:40:30,801 --> 00:40:36,831
So, I'll sort that out.
You are a boring F star-star cunt.

1922
00:40:40,361 --> 00:40:42,750
- Are we pretty much...
- Everything as you requested.

1923
00:40:42,881 --> 00:40:45,031
Fine. Good. Ah, welcome aboard, Liza.

1924
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:48,716
I will make this brief and to the point.

1925
00:40:48,841 --> 00:40:52,117
We're gonna go in,
we're going to state our case,

1926
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:55,517
with new British intelligence
from source Debussy,

1927
00:40:55,641 --> 00:40:58,314
we win the argument,
we get the hell out. All right?

1928
00:40:58,441 --> 00:41:02,354
<i>Resolution 2238 is passed.</i>

1929
00:41:03,321 --> 00:41:05,551
Yeah. That's that, then.

1930
00:41:06,561 --> 00:41:07,437
Yeah?

1931
00:41:07,561 --> 00:41:10,473
Jolly good."That's that, then,"
is your line for the ages, is it?

1932
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:11,920
What?

1933
00:41:13,001 --> 00:41:15,435
Well, I remember,
the day that war was declared,

1934
00:41:15,561 --> 00:41:18,314
I turned to the Minister, and he said...

1935
00:41:18,441 --> 00:41:21,672
"That's that, then.
Anyone want a mint?"

1936
00:41:21,801 --> 00:41:23,757
Piss off, Toby.

1937
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:28,433
<i>- How long before British troops...
- Well done, Michael.</i>

1938
00:41:28,561 --> 00:41:31,758
You did a really, really, really good job.

1939
00:41:32,761 --> 00:41:34,513
Oh, for fuck's sake, don't cry.

1940
00:41:37,081 --> 00:41:40,153
I e-mailed my resignation
five minutes ago.

1941
00:41:40,281 --> 00:41:43,830
And yours should come pretty soon,
for the biggest media impact.

1942
00:41:43,961 --> 00:41:45,519
- I've been thinking.
- Yeah?

1943
00:41:47,161 --> 00:41:49,834
This has been the hardest
political decision of my career.

1944
00:41:50,881 --> 00:41:53,111
I'm not going to resign.

1945
00:41:53,241 --> 00:41:56,074
Huh! What the fuck, George?

1946
00:41:56,201 --> 00:41:58,112
Before the war, I was going to resign,

1947
00:41:58,241 --> 00:42:02,154
but now that there's a war on...
I can't resign.

1948
00:42:02,281 --> 00:42:05,796
You said that this was intolerable.
You said we would go together.

1949
00:42:05,921 --> 00:42:08,879
<i>It is intolerable,
but I'm going to have to tolerate it.</i>

1950
00:42:09,001 --> 00:42:11,754
And I still agree with myself on that.

1951
00:42:11,881 --> 00:42:14,315
But my loyalty is to the kids.
I am a soldier.

1952
00:42:14,441 --> 00:42:16,193
You're not a soldier.

1953
00:42:17,561 --> 00:42:19,711
- I've been a soldier my whole life.
- Yeah?

1954
00:42:19,841 --> 00:42:21,991
What do you mean, I'm not a soldier?
I'm a soldier.

1955
00:42:22,121 --> 00:42:24,715
Look at the uniform - you think
I'm one of the Village People?

1956
00:42:24,841 --> 00:42:27,594
When did you shoot a guy last?

1957
00:42:27,721 --> 00:42:30,315
Oh, not shooting someone in 15 years
means I'm not a soldier?

1958
00:42:30,441 --> 00:42:33,399
You know, the Army doesn't make you
drag some bloody corpse

1959
00:42:33,521 --> 00:42:36,797
into the Pentagon every five years,
to renew your "soldier's licence".

1960
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:40,834
It's unnecessary! And if you were
a good general, you'd have some balls!

1961
00:42:40,961 --> 00:42:43,521
Look, shut up about my balls.
My balls have been around.

1962
00:42:43,641 --> 00:42:45,916
You've got no idea
where my balls have been.

1963
00:42:46,041 --> 00:42:48,874
I can talk about your balls all you want,
cos I remember when...

1964
00:42:49,001 --> 00:42:52,118
Oh, I fucked you once 20 years ago,
and I never hear the end of it!

1965
00:42:52,241 --> 00:42:56,075
Every time we're together, I hear
this shit. I don't even remember it!

1966
00:42:56,201 --> 00:42:58,874
Come on, Chad. We have to draft
resignation announcements.

1967
00:42:59,001 --> 00:43:02,038
Actually, I think I might stay
with the General, if that's OK.

1968
00:43:02,161 --> 00:43:05,836
If he's staying, I might stay with him,
see what assistance I can furnish.

1969
00:43:05,961 --> 00:43:09,351
OK... General Shrek
and his faithful, talking donkey.

1970
00:43:09,481 --> 00:43:11,631
- That was nice.
- OK, well done.

1971
00:43:11,761 --> 00:43:14,480
<i>- What are you sticking around for?
- Well, to let you know</i>

1972
00:43:14,601 --> 00:43:16,557
that I think you've got...

1973
00:43:17,561 --> 00:43:19,279
...big balls...

1974
00:43:19,401 --> 00:43:23,360
- It's like... two-thirds of the snowman.
- Dear God.

1975
00:43:25,281 --> 00:43:27,192
- We did it, Bob, huh?
- Yes, we did, sir.

1976
00:43:27,321 --> 00:43:29,596
There were a few moments
where it got a little hairy.

1977
00:43:29,721 --> 00:43:30,995
No, there weren't.

1978
00:43:33,721 --> 00:43:35,712
No, no, no, Simon. No, no, listen.

1979
00:43:35,841 --> 00:43:38,196
Hey, hey, hey.
Look, look, look. No, no, no.

1980
00:43:41,241 --> 00:43:43,994
- You still don't need to resign.
- I do.

1981
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:45,918
I'm resigning in an hour,

1982
00:43:46,041 --> 00:43:48,760
and there's nothing
you can do about it now.

1983
00:43:48,881 --> 00:43:50,872
- Boss...
- Yes?

1984
00:43:51,001 --> 00:43:53,834
Erm...
it's all over the BBC News websites.

1985
00:43:53,961 --> 00:43:57,033
Partial collapse of the wall.
Mrs Michaelson's greenhouse.

1986
00:43:57,161 --> 00:43:58,833
Obviously, a pane's been smashed.

1987
00:43:58,961 --> 00:44:01,236
The BBC
must have had a crew down there.

1988
00:44:01,361 --> 00:44:03,636
God, how ridiculous!

1989
00:44:03,761 --> 00:44:05,717
<i>And that's news?</i>

1990
00:44:06,721 --> 00:44:08,598
It's not ridiculous.

1991
00:44:08,721 --> 00:44:11,872
It's not ridiculous at all... You're fired.

1992
00:44:13,041 --> 00:44:14,872
What?

1993
00:44:15,001 --> 00:44:18,198
Over the wall -
I mean, that's just not tolerable.

1994
00:44:18,321 --> 00:44:21,199
It's a fucking wall, Malcolm.

1995
00:44:21,321 --> 00:44:22,993
Look. Give me the paper.

1996
00:44:23,121 --> 00:44:27,239
The Telegraph has a cartoon of you
teetering on the Great Wall of China,

1997
00:44:27,361 --> 00:44:30,319
suggesting you are the only
political fuck-up visible from space.

1998
00:44:30,441 --> 00:44:32,796
Look at this. Look at it.

1999
00:44:32,921 --> 00:44:34,877
<i>No-one could survive this.</i>

2000
00:44:35,801 --> 00:44:39,271
The PM's very clear about this.
You're sacked - over the wall.

2001
00:44:39,401 --> 00:44:41,392
- No.
- Yes!

2002
00:44:41,521 --> 00:44:45,275
<i>No. You-You-You haven't
even spoken to the Prime Minister.</i>

2003
00:44:45,401 --> 00:44:46,629
I-I-I have.

2004
00:44:46,761 --> 00:44:49,355
You fucking haven't!
I've been here in front of you.

2005
00:44:49,481 --> 00:44:53,394
<i>I have spoken to the PM. Whether it
happened or not is irrelevant. It is true.</i>

2006
00:44:53,521 --> 00:44:56,911
And he was very clear -
you've got to go.

2007
00:44:59,441 --> 00:45:01,113
Ha!

2008
00:45:02,881 --> 00:45:05,076
If you think I'm going quietly,
Malcolm...

2009
00:45:06,841 --> 00:45:08,718
...you've... you've made a mistake.

2010
00:45:08,841 --> 00:45:11,833
Well, if you want to turn this
into some anti-war protest,

2011
00:45:11,961 --> 00:45:15,749
expect to hear your "mountain
of conflict" sound-bite everywhere.

2012
00:45:15,881 --> 00:45:19,999
From ring-tones to fucking...
a dance mix on YouTube.

2013
00:45:20,121 --> 00:45:24,990
And I will marshal
all the media forces of darkness,

2014
00:45:25,121 --> 00:45:27,191
to hound you to an assisted suicide.

2015
00:45:28,561 --> 00:45:31,917
Right-ho. Let's just go and draft your...
"Dear Prime Minster,

2016
00:45:32,041 --> 00:45:35,590
Just a quick note to say,
'Thanks for giving me the sack,' letter.

2017
00:45:37,641 --> 00:45:39,677
Off we trot.

2018
00:45:39,801 --> 00:45:41,757
Come on, young Simon.

2019
00:45:52,481 --> 00:45:55,791
Erm... General Miller... sorry.
I know this is an awkward time to be...

2020
00:45:55,921 --> 00:45:57,912
Go fuck yourself, Frodo.

2021
00:45:58,041 --> 00:45:59,838
OK.

2022
00:45:59,961 --> 00:46:01,838
You can fuck off yourself, then.

2023
00:46:08,281 --> 00:46:11,318
- Are you hanging, Chad?
- Just... hanging.

2024
00:46:11,441 --> 00:46:14,717
- Wanna play some Facebook chess?
- Yes, ma'am.

2025
00:46:14,841 --> 00:46:17,116
Just get away from the wall!
What are you doing?

2026
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:18,799
I just want a photo near the wall.

2027
00:46:18,921 --> 00:46:22,675
Yeah, you can go back
another 12 inches. No, a bit further.

2028
00:46:22,801 --> 00:46:25,076
- There?
- Stop there!

2029
00:46:25,201 --> 00:46:26,839
Check.

2030
00:46:26,961 --> 00:46:28,838
I haven't touched it.

2031
00:46:28,961 --> 00:46:32,749
I made a move for you, which is
the best move possible, and it's still...

2032
00:46:32,881 --> 00:46:35,998
<i>You might be Secretary
of State someday, young man.</i>

2033
00:46:36,801 --> 00:46:38,996
You... Don't say that
if you don't mean that.

2034
00:46:39,121 --> 00:46:43,911
When, you know, all of this shit
is over, maybe, you know...

2035
00:46:44,041 --> 00:46:47,272
<i>You're a woman... I'm not a woman.</i>

2036
00:46:49,841 --> 00:46:51,718
You wanna have sex again?

2037
00:46:52,761 --> 00:46:55,070
Well, would it be such a terrible idea?

2038
00:46:55,201 --> 00:46:57,157
You know - one more.

2039
00:46:57,281 --> 00:46:59,431
"One more for the Gipper."

2040
00:46:59,561 --> 00:47:02,314
Well, I don't want to be accused
of micro-managing,

2041
00:47:02,441 --> 00:47:06,400
but I cannot understand
why "I Heart Huckabees"

2042
00:47:06,521 --> 00:47:11,117
is on a list of DVDs considered suitable
for armed-forces entertainment.

2043
00:47:11,241 --> 00:47:16,395
That self-indulgent crap
is not suitable for combat troops.

2044
00:47:16,521 --> 00:47:19,797
I've got a selection of the quotations
here for you.

2045
00:47:19,921 --> 00:47:23,152
I mean, they're all local building firms.
Much of a muchness.

2046
00:47:23,281 --> 00:47:25,476
You know,
to sort out the boundary wall.

2047
00:47:25,601 --> 00:47:28,593
But the... this septic tank...

2048
00:47:28,721 --> 00:47:31,360
That is rearing its pooey head again.

2049
00:47:31,481 --> 00:47:32,277
Yes.

2050
00:47:32,401 --> 00:47:36,030
I just got off the phone with Linton,
who proceeded to bitch me out,

2051
00:47:36,161 --> 00:47:39,790
for allowing "I Heart Huckabees"
on the troops' DVD roster.

2052
00:47:39,921 --> 00:47:43,118
Yeah. You know that phrase,
"I'm too old for this shit"?

2053
00:47:43,241 --> 00:47:45,391
<i>Well, I'm too young for this shit.
You know?</i>

2054
00:47:45,521 --> 00:47:48,558
- Here's the new Minister.
- Malcolm!

2055
00:47:48,681 --> 00:47:50,512
- There she is.
- Ladies and gentlemen.

2056
00:47:50,641 --> 00:47:53,360
- Look at you!
- Thank you. Thank you. How touching.

2057
00:47:53,481 --> 00:47:55,870
- Minister, how are you doing?
- Very well indeed.

2058
00:47:56,001 --> 00:47:58,640
- You've lost some weight.
- Hello. Judy Molloy.

2059
00:47:58,761 --> 00:48:02,595
- Nice to meet you. This is Dan.
- Danny. Dan. Special Advisor.

2060
00:48:02,721 --> 00:48:04,996
- Danny Dan?
- War seems to be going great guns.

2061
00:48:05,121 --> 00:48:08,352
- Oh, very cheeky! Very cheeky.
- Judy, have I got a desk out here?

2062
00:48:08,481 --> 00:48:11,917
- Careful. There's blood on the deck.
- Er... yeah, sure. You can use that one.

2063
00:48:12,041 --> 00:48:15,670
How about this? You can't
get better than this. Very glamorous.

2064
00:48:15,801 --> 00:48:18,634
It's a side-step
from my previous job, but that's fine.

2065
00:48:18,761 --> 00:48:21,150
I think there's a wee bit of brains there.

2066
00:48:21,281 --> 00:48:23,158
It's the only brains that he had, actually.

2067
00:48:23,281 --> 00:48:25,511
Nice to meet you, Dan.
Where did you go to school?

2068
00:48:25,641 --> 00:48:28,633
- Erm... just a school in Jersey.
- In Jersey?

2069
00:48:28,761 --> 00:48:30,433
- Is that actually Britain?
- Yeah.

2070
00:48:30,561 --> 00:48:34,156
I'm sorry, but I've been
standing here for 20 minutes...

2071
00:51:09,281 --> 00:51:11,158
Let's see you.

2072
00:51:11,281 --> 00:51:15,991
Look at the hair on this. Who let this
woman out with fucking hair like this,

2073
00:51:16,121 --> 00:51:18,157
on national television?

2074
00:51:18,281 --> 00:51:21,876
You'd think she's got her finger
stuck in a fucking electric socket.

2075
00:51:22,001 --> 00:51:23,639
Unbelievable.
