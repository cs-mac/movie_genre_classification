tea. Do you want one?

<i>- Do you want a cup of tea, Withnail?
- No.</i>

have to wake up to this.</i>

4
00:04:01,827 --> 00:04:04,728
<i>The murder and all-bran and rape?</i>

5
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:08,322
<i>And I'm sitting in this bloody
shack, and I can't cope with Withnail.</i>

discuss his problems in depth.</i>

8
00:04:16,475 --> 00:04:19,137
I have some extremely distressing news.

9

<i>I don't want to hear it. I
don't want to hear anything.</i>

me tell you. It's a nightmare.</i>

11
00:04:27,552 --> 00:04:30,544
We've just run out of wine.
What are we gonna do about it?

12
00:04:30,655 --> 00:04:33,146
<i>I don't know. I don't know.</i>

13
00:04:33,258 --> 00:04:36,284
Oh, God! I don't feel good.

14
00:04:36,395 --> 00:04:40,593
My thumbs have gone weird!

15
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:43,964
I'm in the middle of a bloody overdose.

16
00:04:44,069 --> 00:04:47,038
Oh, God!

17
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:50,199
My heart's beating like a fucked clock!

18
00:04:50,308 --> 00:04:52,742
I feel dreadful. I feel really dreadful.

19
00:04:52,844 --> 00:04:55,210
So do I. So does everybody.

20
00:04:55,313 --> 00:04:57,338
Look at my tongue.

21
00:04:57,449 --> 00:04:59,917
Gray yellow sock.

22
00:05:00,018 --> 00:05:02,748
Sit down, for Christ's sake.
What's the matter with you?

23
00:05:04,222 --> 00:05:06,884

Oh, Christ Almighty! A

Keep back, keep back. The
entire sink's gone rotten.

68
00:07:42,147 --> 00:07:44,047
I don't know what's in here.

That's right. Put on the gloves.

77
00:08:09,407 --> 00:08:12,308
Don't attempt anything
without the gloves.

78

Matter? Where's it coming from?

81

Don't look. I'm dealing with it.

82

I think we've been in here too long.

83
00:08:31,563 --> 00:08:35,192
I feel unusual. I think
we should go outside.

84
00:08:40,271 --> 00:08:43,206
This is ridiculous. Look at me.

85
00:08:43,308 --> 00:08:46,800
I'm 30 in a month, and I've
got a sole flapping off my shoe.

86
00:08:46,911 --> 00:08:49,903
It will get better. It has to.

87
00:08:50,015 --> 00:08:52,950
Easy for you to say, lovey.
You've had an audition.

88
00:08:53,051 --> 00:08:55,519
Why can't I have an audition?

89
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:00,319
It's ridiculous. I've been to
drama school. I'm good-looking.

90
00:09:00,425 --> 00:09:04,521
I tell you, I've a fuck sight more talent
than half the rubbish that gets on television.

91
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:06,722
Why can't I get on television?

92
00:09:06,831 --> 00:09:09,061
I don't know. It'll happen.

93
00:09:09,167 --> 00:09:11,727
Will it? That's what you say.

94
00:09:11,836 --> 00:09:15,431
The only program I'm likely
to get on is the fucking news.

95
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,008
I tell you, I can't
take much more of this.

96
00:09:18,109 --> 00:09:20,543
- I'm gonna crack.
- I'm in the same boat.

97
00:09:20,645 --> 00:09:22,545
Yeah, yeah.

98
00:09:22,647 --> 00:09:25,241
I feel as sick as a pike.

99
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:27,477
I'm gonna have to sit down.

100
00:09:32,657 --> 00:09:35,751
You know what we should do?

101
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:38,488
I say, you know what we should do?

102
00:09:38,596 --> 00:09:41,588
How can I possibly
know what we should do?

103
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:45,227
- What should we do?
- Get out of it for a while.

104
00:09:45,336 --> 00:09:48,100
Get into the countryside, rejuvenate.

105
00:09:48,206 --> 00:09:52,233
Rejuvenate? I'm in a park,
and I'm practically dead.

106
00:09:52,343 --> 00:09:55,244
What good's the countryside?

107
00:09:55,346 --> 00:09:59,510
- What time is it?
- It's 8:00.

108
00:09:59,617 --> 00:10:04,020
Four hours till opening
time. God help us.

109
00:10:04,122 --> 00:10:06,522
Have we got any embrocation?

110
00:10:08,493 --> 00:10:10,961
- What for?
- To rub on us, you fool.

111
00:10:11,062 --> 00:10:14,156
We can cover ourselves in Deep Heat
and get up against the radiator,

112
00:10:14,265 --> 00:10:16,733
keep ourselves alive till 12:00.

113
00:10:18,536 --> 00:10:20,970
Jesus, look at that!

114
00:10:21,072 --> 00:10:23,870
Apart from a raw potato,
that's the only solid...

115
00:10:23,975 --> 00:10:27,103
to have passed my lips
in the last 60 hours.

116
00:10:27,212 --> 00:10:29,612
I must be ill.

117
00:10:31,883 --> 00:10:35,717
<i>Even a stopped clock gives
the right time twice a day.</i>

118
00:10:37,222 --> 00:10:41,181
<i>And for once, I'm inclined to
believe that Withnail is right.</i>

119
00:10:41,292 --> 00:10:45,729
<i>We are, indeed, drifting
into the arena of the unwell,</i>

120

121

<i>What we need is harmony,</i>

122
00:10:53,738 --> 00:10:56,832
<i>fresh air, stuff like that.</i>

123
00:10:56,941 --> 00:11:00,433
Wasn't much in the tube.
Nothing left for you.

124

<i>Why don't you ask your
father for some money?</i>

125
00:11:03,948 --> 00:11:06,917
If we had some money, we could go away.

126
00:11:07,018 --> 00:11:10,681
Why don't you ask your father?
How can it be so cold in here?

127
00:11:10,789 --> 00:11:13,121
Like Greenland in here.

128
00:11:14,893 --> 00:11:19,353
We've got to get some booze. It's the
only solution for this intense cold.

129
00:11:19,464 --> 00:11:23,560
Something's got to be done.
We can't go on like this!

130
00:11:23,668 --> 00:11:27,866
I'm a trained actor reduced
to the status of a bum!

131
00:11:27,972 --> 00:11:32,671
I mean, look at us! Nothing that reasonable
members of society demand as their rights!

132
00:11:32,777 --> 00:11:36,008
No fridges, no televisions, no phones!

133
00:11:36,114 --> 00:11:38,446
Much more of this, I'm gonna
apply for Meals On Wheels.

134
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:42,452
- What happened to your cigar commercial?
- That's what I want to know.

135
00:11:42,554 --> 00:11:45,751
What happened to my agent?
Bastard must have died.

136

<i>September. Bad patch.</i>

00:11:47,859 --> 00:11:50,987
Rubbish. I haven't seen
Gielgud down the Labor Exchange.

138
00:11:51,095 --> 00:11:52,995
Why doesn't he retire?

139
00:11:53,097 --> 00:11:55,998
Oh, look at this little bastard!

Because I don't advise it.

150
00:12:31,502 --> 00:12:34,403
Even the wankers on the site wouldn't
drink that. That's worse than meths.

Nonsense. This is a far
superior drink to meths.

152
00:12:37,575 --> 00:12:40,442
Wankers don't drink it
because they can't afford it.

153
00:12:44,816 --> 00:12:47,785
Have we got any more?

154
00:12:47,886 --> 00:12:50,616
Liar! What's in your toolbox?

155
00:12:50,722 --> 00:12:52,781
No, we have nothing. Sit down.

156
00:12:52,891 --> 00:12:55,291
Liar! You've got antifreeze.

157
00:12:55,393 --> 00:12:58,294
You bloody fool. You should
never mix your drinks!

158
00:13:07,171 --> 00:13:11,073
All right, this is the plan.
We'll get in there and get wrecked.

159
00:13:11,175 --> 00:13:15,111
Then we'll eat a pork pie. Then we'll
drop a couple of Surmontil 50s each.

160
00:13:15,213 --> 00:13:18,649
Means we'll miss out Monday but
come up smiling Tuesday morning.

161
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:22,151
- What's that appalling smell?
- Perfume on my boots.

162
00:13:22,253 --> 00:13:25,313
I had to scrub them
with essence of petunia.

163
00:13:32,563 --> 00:13:36,624
Two large gins, two pints
of cider, ice in the cider.

164
00:13:36,734 --> 00:13:39,294
If my father was loaded,
I'd ask him for some money.

165
00:13:39,404 --> 00:13:42,168
If your father was my
father, you wouldn't get it.

166
00:13:42,273 --> 00:13:44,673
- Here you are,
lads. - Chin-chin.

167
00:13:48,446 --> 00:13:50,346
Ugh!

168
00:13:51,883 --> 00:13:54,511
What about
what's-his-name?

169
00:13:54,619 --> 00:13:57,952
- What about him?
- Why don't you give him a call?

170
00:13:58,056 --> 00:14:01,492
- What for?
- Ask him about his house.

171
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:04,686
You want me to call what's-his-name
and ask him about his house?

172
00:14:04,796 --> 00:14:08,129
- Why not?
- All right. What's his number?

173
00:14:08,232 --> 00:14:10,894
I have no idea. I've never met him.

174
00:14:11,002 --> 00:14:13,903
Well, neither have I. Who the
fuck are you talking about?

175
00:14:14,005 --> 00:14:16,337
Your relative with the
house in the country.

176
00:14:16,441 --> 00:14:19,103
- Monty? Uncle Monty?
- Same. That's the one.

177
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:22,179
Get the Jag fixed up, spend
a week in the country.

178
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:26,080
All right. Give us a tanner,
and I'll give him a bell.

179
00:14:26,184 --> 00:14:30,678
Here. Get a couple more.
I'm going for a slash.

180
00:14:37,628 --> 00:14:39,528
Ponce.

181
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,196
<i>I could hardly piss straight with fear.</i>

182
00:14:45,303 --> 00:14:48,864
<i>A man with three-quarters of an inch
of brain had taken a dislike to me.</i>

183
00:14:48,973 --> 00:14:53,376
<i>What have I done to offend him? I don't
consciously offend big men like this.</i>

184
00:14:53,478 --> 00:14:56,379
<i>And this one has a definite
imbalance of hormone in him.</i>

185
00:14:56,481 --> 00:14:59,609
<i>Get any more masculine than him,
you'd have to live up a tree.</i>

186
00:14:59,717 --> 00:15:02,948
<i>"I fuck arses. " Who fucks arses?</i>

187
00:15:03,054 --> 00:15:05,750
<i>Maybe he fucks arses.</i>

188
00:15:05,857 --> 00:15:08,985
<i>Maybe he's written this in some
moment of drunken sincerity?</i>

189
00:15:09,093 --> 00:15:11,561
<i>I'm in considerable danger in here.</i>

190
00:15:11,662 --> 00:15:13,653
<i>I must get out of here at once.</i>

191
00:15:18,002 --> 00:15:20,163
Perfumed ponce!

192
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,271
You'll be pleased to hear
Monty's invited us for drinks.

193
00:15:25,376 --> 00:15:27,571
Balls to Monty. We're getting out.

194
00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:30,806
Balls to Monty? I already spent
an hour flattering the bugger.

195
00:15:30,915 --> 00:15:34,851
There's a man over there doesn't like
the perfume. A big one. Don't look.

196
00:15:34,952 --> 00:15:37,682
We're in danger. We've got to get out.

197
00:15:37,789 --> 00:15:41,816
- What are you talking about?
- I've been called a ponce.

198
00:15:41,926 --> 00:15:45,054
What fucker said that?

199
00:15:50,601 --> 00:15:53,570
I called him a ponce,

200
00:15:53,671 --> 00:15:56,037
and now I'm calling you one.

201
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:58,267
Ponce!

202
00:15:58,376 --> 00:16:00,708
Would you like a drink?

203
00:16:00,812 --> 00:16:02,837
What's your name? McFuck?

204
00:16:04,215 --> 00:16:07,776
I have a heart condition.
I have a heart condition.

205
00:16:07,885 --> 00:16:10,615
If you hit me, it's murder.

206
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:13,417
I'll murder the pair of yous!

207
00:16:13,524 --> 00:16:16,220
My wife is having a baby.

208
00:16:16,327 --> 00:16:20,855
<i>Listen, I don't know what my...
acquaintance did to upset you,</i>

209
00:16:20,965 --> 00:16:23,490
but it's nothing to do with me.

210
00:16:23,601 --> 00:16:26,229
I suggest you both go outside...

211
00:16:26,337 --> 00:16:29,101
and discuss it sensibly in the street.

212
00:16:31,776 --> 00:16:33,676
Out of my way!

213
00:16:39,417 --> 00:16:42,409
<i>Speed is like a dozen
transatlantic flights...</i>

214
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,886
<i>without ever getting off the plane.</i>

215
00:16:44,989 --> 00:16:49,085
<i>Time change. You lose. You gain.</i>

216
00:16:49,193 --> 00:16:53,220
<i>Makes no difference, so long
as you keep taking the pills.</i>

217
00:16:53,331 --> 00:16:56,164
<i>But sooner or later,
you gotta get out...</i>

218
00:16:56,267 --> 00:16:58,394
<i>because it's crashing,</i>

219
00:16:58,503 --> 00:17:01,495
<i>and all at once those frozen hours...</i>

220
00:17:01,606 --> 00:17:04,234
<i>melt through the nervous system...</i>

221
00:17:04,342 --> 00:17:07,505
<i>and seep out the pores.</i>

222
00:17:08,813 --> 00:17:12,010
Bastards! Just to suck...

223
00:17:12,116 --> 00:17:15,574
some miserable cheap cigar,
and the bastards won't see me.

224
00:17:18,122 --> 00:17:20,090
Why are we having lunch in here?

225
00:17:20,191 --> 00:17:22,182
It's dinner, and Danny's here.

226
00:17:22,293 --> 00:17:24,193
Danny? How did he get in?

227
00:17:24,295 --> 00:17:27,059
I let him in this morning.
He lost one of his clogs.

228
00:17:27,165 --> 00:17:29,793
He's come in because
of this perpetual cold.

229
00:17:29,901 --> 00:17:32,734
Oh, I hope tobacco sales plummet.

230
00:17:32,837 --> 00:17:36,773
I've got your saveloy.
Here. I don't want it.

231
00:17:36,874 --> 00:17:39,638
Then stick it in a soap
tray and save it for later.

232
00:17:39,744 --> 00:17:42,406
Don't vent spleen on
me! I'm in the same boat!

233
00:17:42,513 --> 00:17:45,346
Stop saying that! You're
not in the same boat.

234
00:17:45,449 --> 00:17:49,886
The only thing you're in that I
have been in is this fucking bath!

235
00:17:52,156 --> 00:17:56,388
<i>Danny's here. Headhunter to his friends.</i>

236
00:17:56,494 --> 00:18:00,396
<i>Headhunter to everybody.
He doesn't have any friends.</i>

237
00:18:00,498 --> 00:18:03,228
<i>The only people he converses with...</i>

238
00:18:03,334 --> 00:18:06,235
<i>are his clients and
occasionally the police.</i>

239
00:18:06,337 --> 00:18:11,240
<i>The purveyor of rare herbs and
prescribed chemicals is back.</i>

240
00:18:11,342 --> 00:18:14,368
<i>Will we never be set free?</i>

241
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:22,543
- Danny.
- You're looking very beautiful, man.

242
00:18:22,653 --> 00:18:24,553
Have you been away?

243
00:18:24,655 --> 00:18:28,716
St. Peter preached the epistles
to the apostles looking like that.

244
00:18:28,826 --> 00:18:31,158
Have you got any food?

245
00:18:31,262 --> 00:18:34,663
Mmm. As a matter of
fact, I got a saveloy.

246
00:18:34,765 --> 00:18:37,632
How much is it?

247
00:18:37,735 --> 00:18:39,930
You can have it for nothing.

248
00:18:40,037 --> 00:18:43,097
- I see you're wearing a suit.
- What's it got to do with you?

249
00:18:43,207 --> 00:18:47,439
<i>No need to get uptight, man. I
was merely making an observation.</i>

250
00:18:47,545 --> 00:18:52,073
<i>I happened to be looking for a
suit for the Coalman two weeks ago.</i>

251
00:18:52,183 --> 00:18:55,414
For reasons I can't
really discuss with you...

252
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:58,113
the Coalman had to go to Jamaica.

253
00:18:58,222 --> 00:19:00,986
Got busted coming back through Heathrow.

254
00:19:04,095 --> 00:19:05,995
Had a weight under his fez.

255
00:19:06,097 --> 00:19:10,227
<i>We worked out, it would be very handy
karma for him to get hold of a suit.</i>

256
00:19:10,334 --> 00:19:13,701
But he's a very low-temperature
spade, the Coalman.

257
00:19:13,804 --> 00:19:16,773
Goes into court in
his caftan and a bell.

258
00:19:16,874 --> 00:19:20,810
This doesn't go down at all well.

259
00:19:20,911 --> 00:19:24,472
They can handle the caftan,
but they can't handle the bell.

260
00:19:24,582 --> 00:19:28,143
So there's this judge sitting there
in the cape like fucking Batman...

261
00:19:28,252 --> 00:19:31,813
<i>- with this really rather
far-out looking hat... - Wig.</i>

262
00:19:31,922 --> 00:19:35,983
<i>No, man. This was more
like a long white hat.</i>

263
00:19:36,093 --> 00:19:38,618
So he looks at the Coalman and says,

264
00:19:38,729 --> 00:19:42,324
"What's all this? This is a court,
man. This ain't fancy dress. "

265
00:19:42,433 --> 00:19:45,129
And the Coalman looks at him and says,

266
00:19:45,236 --> 00:19:48,262
"You think you look normal, Your Honor?"

267
00:19:48,372 --> 00:19:51,398
Cunt give him two years.

268
00:19:53,411 --> 00:19:56,471
I'm afraid I can't offer
you gentlemen anything.

269
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:59,310
That's all right, Danny. We
decided to lay off for a bit.

270
00:19:59,417 --> 00:20:03,183
That's what I thought. Except for
personal use, I concur with you.

271
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:07,690
As a matter of fact, I'm thinking
of retiring and going into business.

272
00:20:07,792 --> 00:20:10,283
Doing what?

273
00:20:10,394 --> 00:20:13,625
<i>- The toy industry.
- I thought you were in the bottle industry.</i>

274
00:20:13,731 --> 00:20:17,895
No, man. That's a
sideline. You can have that.

275
00:20:18,002 --> 00:20:20,732
Instructions are included.

276
00:20:20,838 --> 00:20:25,002
Yeah, my partner's got a really
good idea for making dolls.

277
00:20:25,109 --> 00:20:29,671
His name's Presuming Ed.
His sister give him the idea.

278
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:32,476
She got a doll on Christmas
what pisses itself.

279
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:36,019
- Really?
- Yeah, and you gotta change its drawers for it.

280
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,146
It's horrible, really. But
they like that, little girls.

281
00:20:39,256 --> 00:20:42,157
So we're gonna make one
that shits itself as well.

282
00:20:42,259 --> 00:20:44,853
- Shits itself?
- He's an expert.

283
00:20:44,962 --> 00:20:47,726
He's building the prototype now.

284
00:20:50,501 --> 00:20:52,662
Why is he behaving so uptightly?

285
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:56,729
Because a gang of cheeroot vendors
considered a haircut beyond my abilities.

286
00:20:56,841 --> 00:20:59,742
I don't advise a haircut, man.

287
00:20:59,844 --> 00:21:03,007
All hairdressers are in the
employment of the government.

288
00:21:03,114 --> 00:21:05,275
Hair are your aerials.

289
00:21:05,383 --> 00:21:07,851
They pick up signals from the cosmos...

290
00:21:07,952 --> 00:21:10,750
and transmit them
directly into the brain.

291
00:21:10,855 --> 00:21:13,983
This is the reason
bald-headed men are uptight.

292
00:21:14,091 --> 00:21:16,423
What absolute twaddle.

293
00:21:17,862 --> 00:21:19,762
- Has he just been busted?
- No.

294
00:21:19,864 --> 00:21:22,094
Then why is he wearing that old suit?

295
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:26,260
Old suit? This suit was cut
by Hawke's of Savile Row.

296
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:30,329
Just because the best tailoring you've ever seen is
above your fucking appendix doesn't mean anything!

297
00:21:30,441 --> 00:21:32,932
Don't get uptight with me, man.

298
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:37,571
'Cause if you do, I'll have
to give you a dose of medicine.

299
00:21:37,681 --> 00:21:41,777
And if I spike you, you'll
know you've been spoken to.

300
00:21:41,886 --> 00:21:44,616
You wouldn't spike me. You're too mean.

301
00:21:44,722 --> 00:21:47,623
Besides, there's nothing
invented I couldn't take.

302
00:21:47,725 --> 00:21:52,560
If I medicined you, you'd think a
brain tumor was a birthday present.

303
00:21:54,398 --> 00:21:57,492
I could take double anything you could.

304
00:21:59,403 --> 00:22:02,804
Very, very foolish words, man.

305
00:22:02,907 --> 00:22:05,307
He's right, Withnail. Look at him.

306
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:08,310
His mechanism's gone. He's had more
drugs than you've had hot dinners.

307
00:22:08,412 --> 00:22:10,846
I'm not having this
shag sack insulting me.

308
00:22:10,948 --> 00:22:13,143
Let him get his drugs out.

309
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:17,118
This doll is extremely dangerous.

310
00:22:18,956 --> 00:22:22,892
It has voodoo qualities.

311
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:37,602
Trade, "Phenodihydrochrolide benzorex. "

312
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:41,007
Street, "the embalmer. "

313
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:43,341
Balls! I'll swallow it and run a mile.

314
00:22:43,447 --> 00:22:48,146
Cool your boots, man. This
pill's valued at two quid.

315
00:22:48,252 --> 00:22:51,153
- Two quid? You're out of your mind.
- That's sense, Withnail.

316
00:22:51,255 --> 00:22:54,782
You can stuff it up your arse for nothing
and fuck off while you're doing it!

317
00:22:57,294 --> 00:23:01,788
<i>No need to insult me,
man. I was leaving anyway.</i>

318
00:23:05,135 --> 00:23:08,298
Have either of you got shoes?

319
00:23:33,831 --> 00:23:36,299
Monty's car.

320
00:23:44,842 --> 00:23:47,834
Oh, hello! Come in.

321
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:59,617
Sit down, do. Would you like a drink?

322
00:23:59,723 --> 00:24:01,816
- Sherry.
- Sherry.

323
00:24:04,929 --> 00:24:06,829
- Sherry?
- Sherry.

324
00:24:06,931 --> 00:24:08,831
Sherry.

325
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:15,430
Do you like vegetables?

326
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:18,269
I've always been fond of root crops,

327
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:20,900
but I only started to grow last summer.

328
00:24:21,011 --> 00:24:24,606
I happen to think the cauliflower
more beautiful than the rose.

329
00:24:24,715 --> 00:24:26,615
Chin-chin.

330
00:24:26,717 --> 00:24:29,117
- Do you grow?
- Geraniums.

331
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:31,312
Little traitors.

332
00:24:31,422 --> 00:24:34,653
I think the carrot infinitely
more fascinating than the geranium.

333
00:24:34,758 --> 00:24:38,216
Mmm. The carrot has mystery.

334
00:24:38,329 --> 00:24:41,355
Flowers are essentially tarts,

335
00:24:41,465 --> 00:24:44,491
prostitutes for the bees.

336
00:24:45,903 --> 00:24:48,963
<i>There is, you will agree,
a certain "je ne sai quoi,"</i>

337
00:24:49,073 --> 00:24:52,736
something very special
about a firm, young carrot.

338
00:24:52,843 --> 00:24:54,970
Hmm, excuse me.

339
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:58,640
Do help yourselves to another drink.

340
00:24:58,749 --> 00:25:01,217
What's all this? The man's mad.

341
00:25:01,318 --> 00:25:03,878
- Eccentric.
- Eccentric? He's insane!

342
00:25:03,988 --> 00:25:06,582
Not only that, he's a raving homosexual.

343
00:25:08,692 --> 00:25:10,956
<i>You beastly little
parasite! How dare you?</i>

344
00:25:11,061 --> 00:25:13,825
You little thug! How dare you!

345
00:25:16,467 --> 00:25:19,027
Beastly, ungrateful little swine!

346
00:25:19,136 --> 00:25:22,867
- Shall I get you a drink?
- Yes, yes, yes, please, dear boy.

347
00:25:22,973 --> 00:25:25,533
You can prepare me a small
rhesus-negative Bloody Mary.

348
00:25:25,643 --> 00:25:29,773
You must tell me all the news. I haven't
seen you since you finished your last show.

349
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,678
Rather busy, Uncle. TV and stuff.

350
00:25:32,783 --> 00:25:36,082
My agent's attempting to edge me
towards Royal Shakespeare Company again.

351
00:25:36,186 --> 00:25:40,088
<i>- Oh, splendid.
- And he's just had an audition for rep.</i>

352
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:43,353
Oh, splendid! So you're a Thespian too?

353
00:25:46,797 --> 00:25:48,788
Monty used to act.

354
00:25:48,899 --> 00:25:50,799
One hardly says that.

355
00:25:50,901 --> 00:25:54,462
I cracked the boards in my youth,
but I never really had it in my blood.

356
00:25:54,571 --> 00:25:57,131
And that's what's so
essential, isn't it?

357
00:25:57,241 --> 00:25:59,675
The theatrical zeal in the veins.

358
00:25:59,777 --> 00:26:03,838
Alas, I have little more than
vintage wine and memories.

359
00:26:08,152 --> 00:26:11,883
It is the most shattering
experience of a young man's life...

360
00:26:11,989 --> 00:26:15,891
when one morning he awakes and
quite reasonably says to himself,

361
00:26:15,993 --> 00:26:21,454
"I will never play the Dane. "

362
00:26:21,565 --> 00:26:24,728
When that moment comes,

363
00:26:24,835 --> 00:26:28,293
one's ambition ceases.

364
00:26:30,674 --> 00:26:33,165
Don't you agree?

365
00:26:33,277 --> 00:26:37,077
- It's a part I intend to play, Uncle.
- And you'll be marvelous.

366
00:26:37,181 --> 00:26:39,479
Marvelous.

367
00:26:40,884 --> 00:26:43,444
"It's gone.

368
00:26:43,554 --> 00:26:46,751
<i>"We do it wrong, being so ma'jestical...</i>

369
00:26:46,857 --> 00:26:49,587
to offer it the show of violence. "

370
00:26:49,693 --> 00:26:52,787
Let's go. He's a madman.

371
00:26:52,896 --> 00:26:55,660
Any minute now, he's gonna rush
out and get into his tights.

372
00:26:55,766 --> 00:26:59,600
- Okay, okay. Any minute.
- The house or out.

373
00:27:01,538 --> 00:27:03,733
Could I have a word with you, Monty?

374
00:27:03,841 --> 00:27:06,776
Oh, forgive me, dear boy. Forgive me.

375
00:27:06,877 --> 00:27:09,937
<i>I was allowing memory
to have the better of me.</i>

376
00:27:10,047 --> 00:27:12,948
<i>Shall I get you a topper?</i>

377
00:27:21,892 --> 00:27:25,453
Indeed, I remember my first agent.

378
00:27:25,562 --> 00:27:27,689
Raymond Duck.

379
00:27:29,533 --> 00:27:32,525
He was a dreadful little Israelite.

380
00:27:32,636 --> 00:27:35,605
Four floors up on the
Charing Cross Road,

381
00:27:35,706 --> 00:27:38,504
and never a job at the top of them.

382
00:27:40,344 --> 00:27:43,142
I'm told you're a writer too.

383
00:27:45,082 --> 00:27:47,573
<i>Do you write poems?</i>

384
00:27:47,684 --> 00:27:51,643
No. I wish I could. It's
just thoughts, really.

385
00:27:53,357 --> 00:27:55,825
- Are you published?
- Oh, no.

386
00:27:55,926 --> 00:27:58,156
Where did you school?

387
00:27:58,262 --> 00:28:00,890
He went to the other place, Monty.

388
00:28:00,998 --> 00:28:04,229
Oh, you went to Eton?

389
00:28:04,334 --> 00:28:07,030
Get that damned little
swine out of here!

390
00:28:09,139 --> 00:28:12,939
It's trying to get itself in with you.
It's trying for even more advantage.

391
00:28:13,043 --> 00:28:15,204
It's obsessed with its gut. It's
like a bloody rugby ball now.

392
00:28:15,312 --> 00:28:18,611
- It will die! It will die!
- Monty. Monty.

393
00:28:18,715 --> 00:28:21,513
No, no, dear boy. You must leave.

394
00:28:21,618 --> 00:28:23,984
Yet again, that oaf
has destroyed my day.

395
00:28:24,087 --> 00:28:27,113
Listen, Monty. Could I just have
a quick word with you? In private?

396
00:28:27,224 --> 00:28:29,385
Oh... very well.

397
00:28:40,871 --> 00:28:43,863
- Good night, my dears.
- Good night, Monty.

398
00:28:43,974 --> 00:28:47,432
What's all this going off in private
business? Why did you tell him I went to Eton?

399
00:28:47,544 --> 00:28:50,377
Because it wouldn't
have helped if I hadn't.

400
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,711
I'm just trying to establish you in
some sort of context he'd understand.

401
00:28:53,817 --> 00:28:57,514
- What do you mean by that?
- I mean, free to those who can afford it.

402
00:28:57,621 --> 00:29:00,385
Very expensive to those that can't.

403

They're throwing themselves

412

Throwing themselves into the road

At some point or another, I want

What do you want a child for?

417
00:31:05,716 --> 00:31:07,843
To tutor it in the
ways of righteousness...

418
00:31:07,951 --> 00:31:10,249
and procure some uncontaminated urine.

419
00:31:10,354 --> 00:31:14,688
This is a device enabling the drunken
driver to operate in absolute safety.

420
00:31:14,791 --> 00:31:19,694
You fill this with piss, take
this pipe down the trouser...

421

and cellotape this valve
to the end of the old chap.

Then you get horribly drunk,
and they can't fucking touch you.

423
00:31:28,038 --> 00:31:31,030
According to these instructions,

424
00:31:31,141 --> 00:31:34,201
you refuse everything
but a urine sample.

425
00:31:34,311 --> 00:31:37,041
You undo your valve...

426
00:31:37,147 --> 00:31:40,742
and give 'em a dose of
unadulterated child's piss,

427
00:31:40,851 --> 00:31:43,877
and they have to give
you your keys back.

- No, we're not. We're here.

430

We're in the middle of a fucking gale.

431
00:33:15,745 --> 00:33:18,305
You'll have to keep
a look out your side.

432
00:33:18,415 --> 00:33:21,248
If you see anything, tell
me. Get hold of that map.

433
00:33:21,351 --> 00:33:24,081
- Where's the whiskey?
- What for?

434
00:33:24,187 --> 00:33:26,747
I got a bastard behind the eyes.

435
00:33:26,857 --> 00:33:29,655
I can't take aspirins without a drink.

436
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:32,660
- Where's the aspirins?
- Probably in the bathroom.

437
00:33:32,762 --> 00:33:36,459
We've come out here in the middle
of nowhere without aspirins?

438
00:33:36,566 --> 00:33:39,831
- Where are we?
- How should I know where we are?

439
00:33:39,936 --> 00:33:43,337
I feel like a pig shat in my head.

440
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,001
Get hold of that map and look
for a place called Crow Crag.

441
00:34:04,127 --> 00:34:07,961
There must and shall be aspirin.

442
00:34:09,266 --> 00:34:12,326
Give me the keys. Get out of the way.

443
00:34:12,435 --> 00:34:16,132
If I don't get aspirin, I shall die...

- Sitting down to enjoy my holiday.

448
00:35:39,256 --> 00:35:42,555
Right. Now, we're gonna have
to approach this scientifically.

449
00:35:42,659 --> 00:35:45,457
First thing we've got to
do is get this fire alight.

450
00:35:45,562 --> 00:35:47,792
Then we split into two
fact-finding groups.

451
00:35:47,897 --> 00:35:50,331
I'll deal with the
water and other plumbing.

452
00:35:50,433 --> 00:35:53,095
You can check the fuel
and wood situation.

453
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,141
- What's that?
- The fuel and wood situation.

454
00:36:00,243 --> 00:36:03,235
There's nothing out
there except a hurricane.

455
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:10,378
- This place is uninhabitable.
- Give it a chance. It's got to warm up.

456
00:36:10,487 --> 00:36:13,581
Warm up? We may as well
sit around a cigarette.

457
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:16,250
This is ridiculous.

458
00:36:16,359 --> 00:36:19,692
We'll be found dead in here next spring.

459
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:23,694
I've got a blinding fucking headache.

460
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,360
We must have heat.

461
00:36:29,606 --> 00:36:31,836
<i>We've got to keep this bastard burning.</i>

462
00:36:31,941 --> 00:36:34,603
Well, we've got enough
furniture for tonight.

463
00:36:34,711 --> 00:36:37,612
Tomorrow we'll go down
that farm and get some logs.

464
00:36:37,714 --> 00:36:41,912
Mistake, I'm telling you.
This was a dreadful mistake.

465
00:38:52,949 --> 00:38:55,509
<i>- Who's there?
- Me.</i>

466
00:38:58,955 --> 00:39:00,855
What do you want?

467
00:39:00,957 --> 00:39:04,188
I'm a friend of Montague
Withnail's. He's lent us his cottage.

468
00:39:04,294 --> 00:39:08,754
I wondered if you could sell
us some food... eggs and things.

469
00:39:08,865 --> 00:39:11,425
Hmm?

470
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:17,097
What about wood and coal?

471
00:39:17,207 --> 00:39:20,176
I'm not from London, you know.

472
00:39:20,276 --> 00:39:23,541
I don't care where you come from!

473
00:39:23,646 --> 00:39:26,513
<i>Not the attitude I'd
been given to expect...</i>

474
00:39:26,616 --> 00:39:28,846
<i>from the H.E. Bates novel I'd read.</i>

475
00:39:28,952 --> 00:39:33,685
<i>I thought they'd all be out the back,
drinking cider, discussing butter.</i>

476
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:35,690
<i>Clearly a myth.</i>

477
00:39:35,792 --> 00:39:39,888
<i>Evidently, country people are no more
receptive to strangers than city dwellers.</i>

478
00:39:42,966 --> 00:39:46,868
Do you think you could tell me
where I could buy some coal and wood?

479
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:50,098
<i>You'll have to see me
son. He runs this farm.</i>

480
00:39:50,206 --> 00:39:53,198
<i>- Where is your son?
- Up in top fields.</i>

481
00:39:53,309 --> 00:39:57,405
<i>You can't miss him. His
leg's bound in polythene.</i>

482
00:40:21,871 --> 00:40:25,272
Wake up, you bastard! Wake up!

483
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:30,243
Wake up, you bastard!
You gotta get wood.

484
00:40:32,181 --> 00:40:34,411
Jesus! You're covered in shit.

485
00:40:34,517 --> 00:40:36,417
I tried to get the fuel and wood.

486
00:40:36,519 --> 00:40:39,420
There's a miserable little
pensioner down there.

487
00:40:39,522 --> 00:40:42,252
- She wouldn't give it to me.
- Where are we gonna get it, then?

488
00:40:42,358 --> 00:40:44,656
There's a man on the mountain.

489
00:40:44,761 --> 00:40:48,288
Why he's up there fuck knows.

490
00:40:48,398 --> 00:40:51,128
But he's up there with
a leg in polythene.

491
00:40:51,234 --> 00:40:53,634
You can't miss him. He's your man.

492
00:40:53,736 --> 00:40:56,432
And have another look in
that shed. Find anything.

493
00:40:56,539 --> 00:40:59,440
If you can't find
anything, bring in the shed.

494
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:07,008
How come Monty owns such
a horrible little shack?

495
00:41:07,116 --> 00:41:09,050
No idea.

496
00:41:09,152 --> 00:41:11,712
You never discuss your family, do you?

497
00:41:11,821 --> 00:41:14,619
I fail to see my family
as of any interest to you.

498
00:41:14,724 --> 00:41:17,284
I have absolutely no interest in yours.

499
00:41:17,393 --> 00:41:21,022
I dislike relatives in
general, my own in particular.

500
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:24,463
- Why?
- Because... I've told you why.

501
00:41:24,567 --> 00:41:28,526
We're incompatible. They
don't like me being on stage.

502
00:41:28,638 --> 00:41:31,300
<i>Then they must be
delighted with your career.</i>

503
00:41:31,407 --> 00:41:34,069
- What do you mean?
- You rarely are.

504
00:41:34,177 --> 00:41:36,372
You just wait! Just you wait!

505
00:41:36,479 --> 00:41:39,539
When I strike, they
won't know what hit them.

506
00:41:39,649 --> 00:41:41,844
Tractor approaching.

507
00:41:41,951 --> 00:41:44,920
Now get after him. That's the man.

508
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:50,655
- Hey, stop!
- Stop!

509
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,728
Stop! Please!

510
00:41:52,829 --> 00:41:55,525
Stop, please! Please stop!

511
00:41:58,701 --> 00:42:01,397
Please stop!

512
00:42:01,504 --> 00:42:04,405
<i>- Are you the farmer?
- Shut up! I'll deal with this!</i>

513
00:42:04,507 --> 00:42:06,600
We've gone on holiday by mistake.

514
00:42:06,709 --> 00:42:09,075
We're in this cottage
here. Are you the farmer?

515
00:42:09,178 --> 00:42:12,238
Stop saying that, Withnail! Of
course he's the fucking farmer!

516
00:42:12,348 --> 00:42:15,476
We're friends of Montague Withnail.

517
00:42:15,585 --> 00:42:18,179
We desperately need fuel and wood.

518
00:42:18,287 --> 00:42:21,586
Montague Withnail. You must know him!

519
00:42:21,691 --> 00:42:23,852
Fat man, owns the cottage.

520
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:26,861
I seen a fat man.
London type. Queer sort.

521
00:42:26,963 --> 00:42:29,193
Think his name's French, or summit.

522
00:42:29,298 --> 00:42:31,926
<i>- French?
- Aye. Adriene De La Touche.</i>

523
00:42:32,035 --> 00:42:34,595
He ain't been here
for a couple of years.

524
00:42:34,704 --> 00:42:38,003
- Last time I saw him he was with his son.
- Yeah, that's him.

525
00:42:38,107 --> 00:42:42,305
Listen, we're bona fide. We're not from
London. Could we have some fuel and wood?

526
00:42:42,412 --> 00:42:45,779
I could bring you some logs up later.
I've got the cows to feed first.

527
00:42:45,882 --> 00:42:48,316
- When?
- Shut up! That would be very kind.

528
00:42:48,418 --> 00:42:51,581
What about food? Do you think you
could sell us something to eat?

529
00:42:51,688 --> 00:42:54,657
I could bring you a chicken, but
you'll have to go to the village.

530
00:42:54,757 --> 00:42:56,816
- That would be very kind, Mr...
- Parkin.

531
00:42:56,926 --> 00:42:59,827
Mr. Parkin. What happened to your leg?

532
00:42:59,929 --> 00:43:03,262
Got a randy bull up there.
Give me one in the knee.

533
00:43:16,879 --> 00:43:19,746
You wanna go out back?
Get some spuds up?

534
00:43:19,849 --> 00:43:23,580
Sorry, I can't. My
boots are in the oven.

535
00:43:23,686 --> 00:43:26,416
- You'd go if you had boots?

536
00:43:26,522 --> 00:43:28,513
<i>Gladly.</i>

537
00:43:53,783 --> 00:43:56,274
- I've got one!

538
00:44:21,944 --> 00:44:25,175
- Great. How much do we owe you?
- Pay us when you come down.

539
00:44:25,281 --> 00:44:27,545
- What about this chicken?
- He's on the back.

540
00:44:38,127 --> 00:44:41,062
With. With.

541
00:44:41,164 --> 00:44:44,258
Parkin's been. There's our supper.

542
00:44:44,367 --> 00:44:47,165
- What are we supposed to do with that?
- Eat it.

543
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:49,204
Eat it? The fucker's alive.

544
00:44:49,305 --> 00:44:51,205
- Yeah, I know that. You've gotta kill it.
- Me?

545
00:44:51,307 --> 00:44:55,334
- I'm fire lighter and fuel collector.
- Yeah, I know that, but I got the logs in.

546
00:44:59,849 --> 00:45:02,545
It takes away your
appetite looking at it.

547
00:45:02,652 --> 00:45:05,143
No, it doesn't. I'm starving.

548
00:45:05,254 --> 00:45:08,382
- How can we make it die?
- You have to throttle them.

549
00:45:08,491 --> 00:45:13,121
I think you should strangle it instantly,
in case it starts to make friends with us.

550
00:45:13,229 --> 00:45:16,995
All right, get hold of it. You
hold it down. I'll strangle it.

551
00:45:17,099 --> 00:45:21,160
I can't. Those dreadful,
beady eyes. They stare you out.

552
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:25,138
It's a bloody chicken! Just think
of it with bacon across its back.

553
00:45:25,241 --> 00:45:27,766
All right, I'll deal with this.

554
00:45:27,877 --> 00:45:30,437
You'll have to get its guts out.

555
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:40,948
Never point guns at people!
It's extremely dangerous.

556
00:45:41,057 --> 00:45:43,890
What about this roasting dish?
What are we gonna cook it in?

557
00:45:43,993 --> 00:45:47,724
You're the food and plumbings man. I have
no idea. I wish I'd found this an hour ago.

558
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:50,594
I'd have taken great pleasure
in gunning this pullet down.

559
00:45:54,036 --> 00:45:57,062
- Shouldn't it be more bald than that?
- No, it shouldn't.

560
00:45:57,173 --> 00:46:01,769
Right. We're gonna have
to reverse the roles.

561
00:46:01,878 --> 00:46:06,076
We can bake the potatoes in the oven...

562
00:46:06,182 --> 00:46:08,878
and we can boil this
bastard over the fire.

563
00:46:08,985 --> 00:46:11,749
- Let's get its feet off.
- No.

564
00:46:11,854 --> 00:46:14,345
It's gonna need its feet.

565
00:46:29,538 --> 00:46:32,268
It can stand with its legs
on either side of that.

566
00:46:39,749 --> 00:46:43,014
I've already put two shilling pieces in.

567
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:45,883
No, I haven't got another.

568
00:46:45,988 --> 00:46:49,287
It's not my fault if
the system doesn't work.

569
00:46:51,694 --> 00:46:54,060
The bitch hung up on me.

570
00:47:08,444 --> 00:47:11,413
<i>Hello? How are you?</i>

571
00:47:11,514 --> 00:47:14,176
Very well.

572
00:47:14,283 --> 00:47:18,652
A what? Why wouldn't they see me?

573
00:47:18,754 --> 00:47:21,120
This is ridiculous.

574
00:47:21,223 --> 00:47:23,919
I haven't been up for
a job in three months!

575
00:47:24,026 --> 00:47:27,518
Understudy Constantine? I'm not
going to understudy Constantine.

576
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:29,860
Why can't I play the part?

577
00:47:29,966 --> 00:47:32,196
This is ridiculous.

578
00:47:32,301 --> 00:47:35,168
No, I'm not in London. Penrith.

579
00:47:35,271 --> 00:47:37,398
Penrith!

580
00:47:37,506 --> 00:47:39,531
Well, what about TV?

581
00:47:40,776 --> 00:47:43,540
Listen, I pay you ten
percent to do that.

582
00:47:43,646 --> 00:47:47,207
<i>Well, lick ten percent
of the asses for me, then!</i>

583
00:47:47,316 --> 00:47:50,046
<i>Hello? Hello? Hello?</i>

584
00:47:50,152 --> 00:47:54,714
Hello? How dare you? Fuck you!

585
00:47:57,226 --> 00:48:02,027
<i>The bastard asked me to understudy
Constantine in The Seagull.</i>

586
00:48:04,367 --> 00:48:08,497
I don't want to understudy anybody,
especially that little pimp.

587
00:48:10,006 --> 00:48:12,600
Anyway, I loathe those Russian plays.

588
00:48:12,708 --> 00:48:15,609
Always full of women
staring out of windows,

589
00:48:15,711 --> 00:48:17,770
whining about ducks going to Moscow.

590
00:48:28,491 --> 00:48:31,119
What do you think of Desmond Wolfe?

591
00:48:31,227 --> 00:48:34,355
- In respect of what?
- I'm thinking of changing my name.

592
00:48:34,463 --> 00:48:37,626
It's too like Donald Wolfit.

593
00:48:37,733 --> 00:48:39,758
Changeover point.

594
00:48:44,373 --> 00:48:46,933
- Think he's happier than us?
- No.

595
00:48:52,114 --> 00:48:54,241
I suppose happiness is relative.

596
00:48:54,350 --> 00:48:57,080
I never thought it would be a
polythene bag without a hole in it.

597
00:48:57,186 --> 00:49:00,314
- Hey!
- What's the matter with him?

598
00:49:00,423 --> 00:49:03,756
- Shut the gate!
- You didn't shut the gate!

599
00:49:03,859 --> 00:49:05,850
<i>Stop that bull!</i>

600
00:49:07,696 --> 00:49:09,994
<i>Stop that bull!</i>

601
00:49:13,302 --> 00:49:16,362
Grab its ring! Keep your bag up!

602
00:49:16,472 --> 00:49:18,838
<i>Out-mind him.</i>

603
00:49:18,941 --> 00:49:21,967
Hey, show no fear. Just run at it.

604
00:49:22,078 --> 00:49:24,410
That can't be sensible, can it?
The bastard's about to run at me!

605
00:49:24,513 --> 00:49:26,811
- Well, he's randy!
- Yes, I know he is!

606
00:49:26,916 --> 00:49:29,214
Wants to get down there and
have sex with those cows.

607
00:49:29,318 --> 00:49:31,445
Shut up!

608
00:49:31,554 --> 00:49:35,650
- Run at it, shouting!
- Do as he says, start shouting.

609
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:41,723
- He won't gore you.
- A coward you are, Withnail!

610
00:49:41,831 --> 00:49:45,062
An expert on bulls you are not!

611
00:49:57,513 --> 00:49:59,413
Shut that gate and keep it shut!

612
00:50:02,318 --> 00:50:05,219
I think an evening at the Crow.

613
00:50:07,990 --> 00:50:11,824
<i>If the Crow and Crown ever
had life, it was dead now.</i>

614
00:50:11,927 --> 00:50:14,452
<i>It was like walking into a lung,</i>

615
00:50:14,563 --> 00:50:18,795
<i>a sulfer-stained, nicotine
yellow and fly-blown lung.</i>

616
00:50:18,901 --> 00:50:23,031
<i>Its landlord was a retired alcoholic
with military pretensions...</i>

617
00:50:23,139 --> 00:50:25,505
<i>and a complexion like
the inside of a teapot.</i>

618
00:50:26,509 --> 00:50:29,774
<i>By the time the doors opened,
he was arse-holed on rum...</i>

619
00:50:29,879 --> 00:50:32,006
<i>and got progressively
more arse-holed...</i>

620
00:50:32,114 --> 00:50:35,379
<i>till he could take no more</i>

621
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:41,016
We'll have another
pair of large scotches.

622
00:50:58,674 --> 00:51:01,609
Thought I was going for a minute.

623
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:03,701
No man's put me down yet.

624
00:51:03,812 --> 00:51:05,905
Have you had any training
in the martial arts?

625
00:51:06,015 --> 00:51:08,415
Yes, as a matter of fact, I have.

626
00:51:08,517 --> 00:51:11,384
Before I became a journalist,
I was in the Territorials.

627
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:14,285
You know, when you first came in,

628
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:17,359
I knew you were a services man.

629
00:51:17,459 --> 00:51:20,917
You could never, never disguise it.

630
00:51:23,532 --> 00:51:26,763
- What were you in?
- Tanks.

631
00:51:26,869 --> 00:51:30,134
Africa Corps. Little before your time.

632
00:51:30,239 --> 00:51:32,969
I don't suppose you've
engaged, have you?

633
00:51:33,075 --> 00:51:37,239
- Ireland.
- Ooh, crack at the Mick?

634
00:51:37,346 --> 00:51:40,281
We'll have another
pair of large scotches.

635
00:51:40,382 --> 00:51:42,942
These shall be my pleasure.

636
00:51:48,324 --> 00:51:50,292
What are you doing up here, then?

637
00:51:50,392 --> 00:51:52,360
<i>We're doing a feature for Country Life.</i>

638
00:51:52,461 --> 00:51:54,361
Survey of rural types.

639
00:51:54,463 --> 00:51:58,797
You know, farmers, traveling tinkers,

640
00:51:58,901 --> 00:52:01,267
milkmen, that sort of thing.

641
00:52:01,370 --> 00:52:03,270
Have you...

642
00:52:05,774 --> 00:52:07,901
Have you met Jake?

643
00:52:08,010 --> 00:52:10,570
Poacher. Works the lake.

644
00:52:10,679 --> 00:52:14,206
But, uh, keep it under your hat, hmm?

645
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:27,153
What's all this army bollocks?

646
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:29,891
We got a drink, didn't we?

647
00:52:32,635 --> 00:52:35,195
Time, gentlemen.

648
00:52:37,539 --> 00:52:39,530
I think he means it.

649
00:53:10,606 --> 00:53:13,700
- Go ask him if we can have one.
- What for?

650
00:53:13,809 --> 00:53:17,438
So we can eat it.
We're fed up with stew!

651
00:53:23,786 --> 00:53:26,778
Excuse me. Could we have an eel?

652
00:53:26,889 --> 00:53:30,484
- You've got eels down your leg.
- You leave them alone.

653
00:53:30,592 --> 00:53:34,426
Nothing down there of interest to you.

654
00:53:34,530 --> 00:53:37,294
Help us out, Raymond.

655
00:53:37,399 --> 00:53:41,563
These be fed from asshole to beak.

656
00:53:43,405 --> 00:53:47,432
How about one of those
pheasants? Go on, ask him.

657
00:53:49,211 --> 00:53:52,977
Excuse me. We were wondering if we
could purchase a pheasant off of you?

658
00:53:53,082 --> 00:53:55,414
No. I've got nothing to sell.

659
00:53:55,517 --> 00:53:58,486
Come on, old boy. What's in your hump?

660
00:53:58,587 --> 00:54:03,490
Now look, you. Them pheasants are for
his pot. These here are for my pot.

661
00:54:03,592 --> 00:54:06,527
<i>Now what makes you think I should
give you something for your pot?</i>

662
00:54:06,628 --> 00:54:09,392
- What pot?
- Our cooking pot.

663
00:54:09,498 --> 00:54:13,195
He knows. Hey, give us
a wheeze on that fag.

664
00:54:17,005 --> 00:54:20,441
I might come and see you lads in a
week. I might fetch you up a rabbit.

665
00:54:20,542 --> 00:54:23,306
We don't want a rabbit.
We want a pheasant.

666
00:54:23,412 --> 00:54:26,438
<i>Listen, you young prat.
I ain't got no pheasants.</i>

667
00:54:26,548 --> 00:54:29,073
I ain't got no birds,
no more than you have.

668
00:54:29,184 --> 00:54:32,312
Of course you have. You're the poacher.

669
00:54:32,421 --> 00:54:35,413
If I hear more words out of you,

670
00:54:35,524 --> 00:54:38,755
I'll put one of these
here black pods on you.

671
00:54:38,861 --> 00:54:41,921
- Don't threaten me with a dead fish.
- Half dead, he may be.

672
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:45,693
But I'll come up after you, and
I'll wake you up with a live one.

673
00:54:45,801 --> 00:54:49,760
Sod your pheasants! You'll
have to find us first.

674
00:54:49,872 --> 00:54:52,705
<i>I know where you are, at Crow Crag.</i>

675
00:54:52,808 --> 00:54:54,901
<i>I've been watching you.</i>

676
00:54:55,010 --> 00:54:57,774
Especially you, prancing like a tit.

677
00:54:59,548 --> 00:55:02,346
You want working on, boy.

678
00:55:02,451 --> 00:55:06,251
If I see that silage heap
hanging about up here,

679
00:55:06,355 --> 00:55:09,586
I'll take the bastard axe to him!

680
00:55:09,691 --> 00:55:13,593
Bastards! You'll all suffer!

681
00:55:13,695 --> 00:55:16,163
I'll show the lot of you!

682
00:55:16,265 --> 00:55:19,701
I'm gonna be a star!

683
00:55:23,505 --> 00:55:25,598
Vegetables again.

684
00:55:25,674 --> 00:55:28,336
I'll be sprouting bloody feelers soon.

685
00:55:28,444 --> 00:55:31,311
Must be 20,000 sheep out
there on those volcanoes,

686
00:55:31,413 --> 00:55:34,007
and we got a plate full of carrots.

687
00:55:34,116 --> 00:55:37,483
- There's black puddings in it.
- Black puddings are no good to us.

688
00:55:37,586 --> 00:55:40,384
I want something's flesh!

689
00:55:51,967 --> 00:55:54,731
Look! Come here! Down here. Look.

690
00:55:54,837 --> 00:55:57,567
Under the rock. I can see it.

691
00:55:58,807 --> 00:56:01,503
See him? Look.

692
00:56:01,610 --> 00:56:03,840
He's over there. Look. Here.

693
00:56:03,946 --> 00:56:06,779
There's two of them here.
Look. Come on, come on.

694
00:56:06,882 --> 00:56:09,043
Where?

695
00:56:32,174 --> 00:56:35,371
I think I'll call myself Donald Twain.

696
00:56:36,478 --> 00:56:40,608
Stop. Get down.

697
00:56:42,184 --> 00:56:44,652
It's him. What does he want?

698
00:56:44,753 --> 00:56:48,120
- Go down there and ask him.
- Don't be a fool. He's got a gun.

699
00:56:48,223 --> 00:56:50,885
Bastard's psychotic. You've
only got to look at him.

700
00:57:01,203 --> 00:57:04,434
This place has become impossible.

701
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:07,998
Perpetual rain, freezing cold.

702
00:57:08,110 --> 00:57:10,874
Now a bloody madman on the
prowl outside with eels.

703
00:57:10,979 --> 00:57:13,743
All right, you made your point.

704
00:57:13,849 --> 00:57:17,012
We pack up. We get out tomorrow.

705
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:19,212
- What are you doing?
- I'm going for a slash.

706
00:57:19,321 --> 00:57:21,915
No, you're not. I can't get
my boots on when they're hot.

707
00:57:22,024 --> 00:57:24,754
- I'll go alone.
- You're not leaving me in here alone.

708
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:28,421
<i>- Those are the kind of windows faces look in at.
- Then I won't have a slash.</i>

709
00:57:28,530 --> 00:57:30,760
And in both our interests, I think
we should sleep together tonight.

710
00:57:30,866 --> 00:57:33,926
Don't be ridiculous. He's not
gonna come up here in the dark.

711
00:57:34,036 --> 00:57:36,436
Of course he is. If
he catches one of us,

712
00:57:36,538 --> 00:57:39,268
he's got a better chance
of dealing with the other.

713
00:57:39,374 --> 00:57:41,968
<i>No.</i>

714
00:57:55,023 --> 00:57:58,390
What's the matter with you?
What are you laughing at?

715
00:57:58,493 --> 00:58:00,859
I was dreaming. What do you want?

716
00:58:00,963 --> 00:58:04,421
You frightened the piss out of
me. Move over. I'm getting in.

717
00:58:08,971 --> 00:58:12,463
Oh, this is ridiculous. I'll
have to sleep in your bed.

718
00:58:12,574 --> 00:58:14,974
- I'll have to come with you.
- Will you get out?

719
00:58:15,077 --> 00:58:17,841
- No.
- All right, then I will.

720
00:58:26,288 --> 00:58:29,189
All right, you can stay,
but the gun doesn't.

721
00:58:29,291 --> 00:58:31,987
No. I have to keep the gun.
I intend to remain awake.

722
00:58:32,094 --> 00:58:34,688
- This is my bed, and I demand precedence.
- No!

723
00:58:40,435 --> 00:58:43,666
Mad fucking bastard!

724
00:59:06,328 --> 00:59:09,297
Shhh! Shhh!

725
00:59:09,398 --> 00:59:12,526
- Listen.
- There is nothing! Get to bed!

726
00:59:12,634 --> 00:59:15,034
I heard a noise.

727
00:59:15,137 --> 00:59:17,037
I must get in.

728
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:22,298
<i>Oh, for fuck's sake.</i>

729
00:59:22,411 --> 00:59:24,606
- What was that?
- That's it. That's it.

730
00:59:24,713 --> 00:59:27,307
- What is it?
- It's the killer.

731
00:59:27,416 --> 00:59:31,375
<i>- It's probably foxes looking for grub.
- Listen. Listen.</i>

732
00:59:31,486 --> 00:59:34,216
Maybe it's the farmer.

733
00:59:34,322 --> 00:59:38,156
At 2:00 in the morning? It's the killer.

734
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:41,752
He's come to kill us.
What are we gonna do?

735
00:59:44,332 --> 00:59:47,267
He wants to come in.
He's trying to get in.

736
00:59:47,369 --> 00:59:50,361
He can't. He'll go away.

737
00:59:50,472 --> 00:59:52,565
He's going away.

738
00:59:57,946 --> 01:00:00,073
<i>This is all your fault.</i>

739
01:00:00,182 --> 01:00:03,151
You've even given him the fucking gun.

740
01:00:08,056 --> 01:00:11,253
He's coming through the
window. He's getting in.

741
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:14,522
- Give me the matches.
- Downstairs.

742
01:00:16,198 --> 01:00:20,760
He's in. He's sharpening
a fucking knife.

743
01:00:22,971 --> 01:00:26,372
We'll have to tackle him. You stay
in bed, pretending to be asleep.

744
01:00:26,475 --> 01:00:29,376
He'll go for you. When he
does, I'll jump on his back.

745
01:00:29,478 --> 01:00:32,413
No, no, no. It'll be too
late. I'll be knifed by then.

746
01:00:32,514 --> 01:00:35,347
We'll have to try and
make friends with him.

747
01:00:41,389 --> 01:00:44,756
They're going into your
room. It's you he wants.

748
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:48,023
Offer him yourself.

749
01:00:58,774 --> 01:01:02,107
We mean no harm!

750
01:01:02,210 --> 01:01:06,544
<i>Oh, my boys! My boys! Forgive me!</i>

751
01:01:06,648 --> 01:01:10,744
- Monty! Monty, Monty!
- Monty, you terrible cunt!

752
01:01:10,852 --> 01:01:14,083
<i>Forgive me. It was inconsiderate
of me not to have telegrammed.</i>

753
01:01:14,189 --> 01:01:17,181
What are you doing, prowling around
in the middle of the fucking night!

754
01:01:17,292 --> 01:01:21,228
I had a punctured tire. I had
to wait an eon for assistance.

755
01:01:21,329 --> 01:01:24,628
I'm sorry if I frightened you.
I should have knocked, but...

756
01:01:24,733 --> 01:01:28,726
<i>- I- I-I'll sleep in the other
room, if I may. - Anywhere you like.</i>

757
01:01:28,837 --> 01:01:32,329
Uh, yes, well. Uh... good night.

758
01:01:36,511 --> 01:01:39,674
Brrr! Ah, good morning.
Did you sleep well?

759
01:01:39,781 --> 01:01:41,681
Mm-hmm.

760
01:01:46,254 --> 01:01:49,621
Um, I-I-I do apologize
for last night.

761
01:01:49,724 --> 01:01:53,626
- It was perfectly inconsiderate of me.
- It's perfectly all right, Monty.

762
01:01:53,728 --> 01:01:56,561
- You've been busy in here?
- As a bee.

763
01:01:56,665 --> 01:02:00,601
- How did you repair the window?
- Oh, I didn't break it.

764
01:02:00,702 --> 01:02:05,366
Merely forced it a little.
Sorry if I frightened you.

765
01:02:05,473 --> 01:02:08,567
There was an empty wine
bottle on the ledge.

766
01:02:08,677 --> 01:02:11,805
Oh, tomatoes. Yes.

767
01:02:17,452 --> 01:02:20,910
<i>Why don't you go and wake
him? Breakfast in 15 minutes.</i>

768
01:02:21,022 --> 01:02:25,356
The old order changeth,

769
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:28,952
yielding place to new.

770
01:02:29,064 --> 01:02:33,797
And God fulfills Himself in many ways.

771
01:02:33,902 --> 01:02:36,370
And soon...

772
01:02:37,472 --> 01:02:39,770
I suppose...

773
01:02:39,875 --> 01:02:41,968
I shall be swept away...

774
01:02:42,077 --> 01:02:45,376
by some vulgar little tumor.

775
01:02:46,848 --> 01:02:49,282
Oh, my boys.

776
01:02:49,384 --> 01:02:52,842
My boys, we're at the end of an age.

777
01:02:52,954 --> 01:02:56,253
We live in a land of
weather forecasts...

778
01:02:56,358 --> 01:02:59,259
and breakfasts that 'set in,'

779
01:02:59,361 --> 01:03:03,297
shat on by Tories, shoveled up by Labor.

780
01:03:03,398 --> 01:03:07,198
And here we are... we three...

781
01:03:07,302 --> 01:03:11,705
perhaps the last island
of beauty in the world.

782
01:03:14,809 --> 01:03:18,677
Now, which of you is going
to be a splendid fellow...

783
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:21,772
and go down to the Rolls
for the rest of the wine?

784
01:03:21,883 --> 01:03:25,148
- I will.
- No, I'd better go. I wanna dig the car out anyway.

785
01:03:25,253 --> 01:03:29,019
- But we have my car, dear boy.
- Yes, but if it rains, we're buggered.

786
01:03:29,124 --> 01:03:31,456
- I mean...
- Stranded!

787
01:03:31,559 --> 01:03:35,051
- We'll leave the car till later. Leave this to me.
- I'll come. I fancy a walk.

788
01:03:35,163 --> 01:03:38,997
No, I hear you're a little wizard in the
kitchen. I shall need you, to work the joint.

789
01:03:39,100 --> 01:03:43,969
<i>- Yeah, you're the cook.
- And... what on earth are those?</i>

790
01:03:44,072 --> 01:03:46,404
- We forgot to bring our Wellingtons.
- Oh, but how dreadful.

791
01:03:46,508 --> 01:03:49,739
Do you mean you've been up here in all this
beastly mud and oomska without Wellingtons?

792
01:03:49,844 --> 01:03:52,642
Well, this afternoon I shall
take you both into Penrith...

793
01:03:52,747 --> 01:03:56,376
and get you fitted with some
good quality rubber boots.

794
01:03:59,988 --> 01:04:03,480
Garlic, rosemary and salt.

795
01:04:05,226 --> 01:04:08,218
I brought two of these in case either
of you was any good in the kitchen.

796
01:04:08,330 --> 01:04:11,595
- I'm not.
- Of course you are. Cooking is one of the natural instincts.

797
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:15,431
Listen, Monty. This is
all very kind of you,

798
01:04:15,537 --> 01:04:18,005
but I really think I ought to be out
there getting work done on the car.

799
01:04:18,106 --> 01:04:20,700
You haven't time. We're
taking late luncheon at 3:00.

800
01:04:20,809 --> 01:04:23,869
- I'm afraid we have to leave by 3:00, Monty.
- Leave?

801
01:04:23,979 --> 01:04:26,846
Oh, didn't he tell you? We
have to get back to sign on.

802
01:04:26,948 --> 01:04:32,443
- Sign on? At the Labor Exchange?
- Yeah.

803
01:04:32,554 --> 01:04:36,923
It's sort of fashionable, actually.
All the actors do it. Even Redgrave.

804
01:04:38,593 --> 01:04:42,962
But surely you could forego
for just this one occasion.

805
01:04:43,064 --> 01:04:45,897
I've come a very long
way to see you both.

806
01:04:46,001 --> 01:04:50,938
<i>Can't, actually. I mean, I'd love to stay,
but he's more adamant to get back than I am.</i>

807
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:54,167
Then we must choose our moment...

808
01:04:56,411 --> 01:04:59,676
and have a word with him.

809
01:05:02,283 --> 01:05:05,047
I'm sure together we could persuade him.

810
01:05:07,622 --> 01:05:11,114
There. Now, garlic,

811
01:05:11,226 --> 01:05:13,888
rosemary and salt.

812
01:05:13,995 --> 01:05:17,192
I can never touch
meat until it's cooked.

813
01:05:17,298 --> 01:05:20,563
As a youth, I used to
weep in butcher shops.

814
01:05:20,668 --> 01:05:23,831
<i>- I can't find the rosemary.
- Ah.</i>

815
01:05:25,907 --> 01:05:28,774
Can't find the rosemary.

816
01:05:30,445 --> 01:05:32,413
I'm sure we could find it together.

817
01:05:35,316 --> 01:05:38,410
- Perhaps it's in the other bag.
- Perhaps it is.

818
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:40,420
Shall we look?

819
01:05:44,259 --> 01:05:46,784
Oh, sorry. Sherry's in there.

820
01:05:52,267 --> 01:05:55,327
What do you mean, "sorry"? What's
going on? What's he doing here?

821
01:05:55,437 --> 01:05:57,701
We can't stay. He won't leave me alone.

822
01:05:57,806 --> 01:06:00,206
<i>All right. We'll get the lunch
done, and then we'll leave.</i>

823
01:06:01,943 --> 01:06:05,504
I'm afraid we must drink from these.

824
01:06:10,585 --> 01:06:13,850
I trust their shapes will
not offend your palates.

825
01:06:13,955 --> 01:06:18,358
- Chin-chin. - To a delightful
weekend in the country.

826
01:06:42,884 --> 01:06:45,216
I do think you could have shaved.

827
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:48,414
What on earth will people think
of me turning up with you two?

828
01:06:48,523 --> 01:06:50,821
You look like a pair of farm hands.

829
01:06:56,898 --> 01:06:58,798
Tsk!

830
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:00,800
This is most embarrassing.

831
01:07:03,037 --> 01:07:05,505
Get away from the car.

832
01:07:05,607 --> 01:07:08,508
Buy the Wellingtons.

833
01:07:08,610 --> 01:07:12,011
I'm going to buy some
razors and shaving soap.

834
01:07:12,113 --> 01:07:14,877
I'll see you over there in half an hour.

835
01:07:14,983 --> 01:07:17,884
- Pair of blues.
- One each.

836
01:07:19,387 --> 01:07:21,855
- I think a drink, don't you?
- What about the Wellingtons?

837
01:07:21,956 --> 01:07:23,856
Oh, bollocks to the Wellingtons.

838
01:07:23,958 --> 01:07:26,859
We'll tell them they had a farmer's
conference and had a run on them.

839
01:07:36,337 --> 01:07:39,431
Okay. Yeah. Promise.

840
01:07:39,541 --> 01:07:41,907
Bye.

841
01:07:45,213 --> 01:07:50,173
No, hasn't heard a thing. Apparently,
they're still seeing people.

842
01:07:50,285 --> 01:07:53,277
You don't want to go to Manchester
anyway. Play a bloody soldier?

843
01:07:53,388 --> 01:07:55,720
Don't I? I damned well do.

844
01:07:55,823 --> 01:07:58,519
- It's a bloody good little theater.
- It's not much of a part, is it?

845
01:07:58,626 --> 01:08:00,594
Well, it's better than nothing.

846
01:08:00,695 --> 01:08:04,096
- They'll make you cut your hair.
- So what? You'd lose a leg.

847
01:08:04,199 --> 01:08:07,168
- Time gents, please.
- All right. We're gonna have to work quickly.

848
01:08:07,268 --> 01:08:10,931
A pair of quadruple whiskies and
another pair of pints, please.

849
01:08:15,109 --> 01:08:18,601
Where is he? I'm utterly assholed.

850
01:08:18,713 --> 01:08:20,613
We're early.

851
01:08:22,617 --> 01:08:25,415
We want to get in there, don't we?

852
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:28,353
Eat some cake, soak up the booze.

853
01:08:39,634 --> 01:08:41,932
- All right here?
- What do you want?

854
01:08:42,036 --> 01:08:46,166
- Cake. All right here?
- Uh, no. We're closing in a minute.

855
01:08:46,274 --> 01:08:48,674
We're leaving in a minute.

856
01:08:53,815 --> 01:08:58,013
- We want cake and tea.
- Didn't you hear?

857
01:08:58,119 --> 01:09:01,384
She said she'd closed.
What do you want in here?

858
01:09:01,489 --> 01:09:05,016
Cake. What's it got to do with you?

859
01:09:05,126 --> 01:09:07,822
I happen to be the proprietor.

860
01:09:07,929 --> 01:09:10,363
Now, would you leave?

861
01:09:10,465 --> 01:09:13,662
Ah, I'm glad you're the proprietor.

862
01:09:13,768 --> 01:09:16,703
I was gonna have to have
a word with you anyway.

863
01:09:16,804 --> 01:09:19,238
We're working on a film up here.

864
01:09:19,340 --> 01:09:21,865
Location, see.

865
01:09:21,976 --> 01:09:24,638
We might want to do a film in here.

866
01:09:24,746 --> 01:09:29,376
- You're drunk.
- Just bring out the cakes. Cake and fine wine.

867
01:09:29,484 --> 01:09:32,817
- If you don't leave, we'll call the police.
- Balls!

868
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:35,548
We want the finest wines
available to humanity.

869
01:09:35,657 --> 01:09:38,023
And we want them here,
and we want them now.

870
01:09:38,126 --> 01:09:40,492
<i>Miss Blenehassitt, telephone the police.</i>

871
01:09:40,595 --> 01:09:44,998
It's all right, Miss Blenehassitt.

872
01:09:45,099 --> 01:09:49,297
<i>I'm warning you, if
you do, you're fired.</i>

873
01:09:49,404 --> 01:09:51,895
We're multimillionaires.

874
01:09:52,006 --> 01:09:54,338
We shall buy this place
and fire you immediately.

875
01:09:54,442 --> 01:09:59,379
Yes, we'll buy this place, and we'll
install a fucking jukebox in here...

876
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:03,007
and liven all of you stiffs up a bit.

877
01:10:03,117 --> 01:10:05,483
The police, Miss Blenehassitt.

878
01:10:05,586 --> 01:10:09,545
Just say there are a couple of drunks in the
Penrith Tea Rooms, and we want them removed.

879
01:10:09,657 --> 01:10:13,024
We are not drunks. We
are multimillionaires.

880
01:10:13,127 --> 01:10:16,528
Hurry up, Mabs. We'll keep
them here till they arrive.

881
01:10:16,631 --> 01:10:18,792
<i>You won't keep us anywhere.</i>

882
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:21,027
We'll buy this place
and have it knocked down.

883
01:10:21,135 --> 01:10:23,433
<i>- Right, right, right.
- Police, please.</i>

884
01:10:23,538 --> 01:10:26,166
Right. We're going.

885
01:10:26,274 --> 01:10:29,266
Our car has arrived.

886
01:10:29,377 --> 01:10:31,902
We'll be back.

887
01:10:32,013 --> 01:10:36,006
<i>We're coming back in here.</i>

888
01:10:41,022 --> 01:10:43,684
- Where is he?
- Sulking up the hill.

889
01:10:43,791 --> 01:10:46,157
He says he won't come in
for lunch without an apology.

890
01:10:46,260 --> 01:10:48,660
Suits me. He can eat his fucking radish.

891
01:10:50,431 --> 01:10:52,331
It's all your fault.

892
01:10:52,433 --> 01:10:56,335
- You lead him astray.
- I beg your pardon, Monty.

893
01:10:56,437 --> 01:11:00,567
Don't tell me you're not aware of it.
I know what you're up to, and so do you.

894
01:11:00,675 --> 01:11:04,167
- Sherry?
- Sherry? Oh, dear, no, no, no.

895
01:11:04,278 --> 01:11:08,840
I'd be sucked into his trap. One
of us has got to stay on guard.

896
01:11:08,950 --> 01:11:12,113
He's so mauve. We don't
know what he's planning.

897
01:11:22,663 --> 01:11:25,894
I'm preparing myself to forgive you.

898
01:11:27,869 --> 01:11:30,804
I think you've been punished enough.

899
01:11:32,540 --> 01:11:35,907
I think we'd better release
you from the legumes...

900
01:11:36,010 --> 01:11:38,501
and transfer your talents to the meat.

901
01:11:45,987 --> 01:11:48,820
You shouldn't treat each other so badly.

902
01:11:48,923 --> 01:11:52,017
This boy's been out there
frozen to the marrow,

903
01:11:52,126 --> 01:11:54,526
and you just sit in here drinking.

904
01:11:54,629 --> 01:11:58,759
Come along. He's going to revitalize himself,
and you're going to finish the vegetables.

905
01:11:58,866 --> 01:12:01,300
- I don't know how to do them.
- Well, of course you don't.

906
01:12:01,402 --> 01:12:03,802
You are incapable of indulging
in anything but pleasure.

907
01:12:03,905 --> 01:12:06,840
Am I not right? You don't
deserve such loyalty.

908
01:12:06,941 --> 01:12:11,571
Now, come along. I'm going to
teach you how to peel a potato.

909
01:12:16,918 --> 01:12:20,149
Isn't it stimulating, getting back
to a basic sort of life for a while?

910
01:12:20,254 --> 01:12:23,018
- Yes.
- Surrounded by trees and nature,

911
01:12:23,124 --> 01:12:26,116
one feels a glorious
stirring of the senses...

912
01:12:26,227 --> 01:12:28,525
a rejection of poisonous inhibition...

913
01:12:28,629 --> 01:12:31,120
and a fecund motion of the soul.

914
01:12:31,232 --> 01:12:36,295
Except, of course, the problems tend
to take the edge off the pleasure.

915
01:12:36,404 --> 01:12:40,898
I mean, with no proper facilities.

916
01:12:41,008 --> 01:12:44,705
All the glorious trials
of youth, dear boy.

917
01:12:44,812 --> 01:12:50,478
When I was a lad, I'd rocket off on my tandem
with Wrigglesworth, and we'd just ride and ride.

918
01:12:50,585 --> 01:12:55,352
And at night we'd find
some barn and fall asleep,

919
01:12:55,456 --> 01:12:59,017
with the perfumes of
nature sighing on our skin.

920
01:12:59,126 --> 01:13:02,653
Would it be in bad form
to plagiarize a toast?

921
01:13:02,763 --> 01:13:05,596
It depends entirely on
the quality of the wine.

922
01:13:05,700 --> 01:13:08,965
In this instance, it
most certainly would not.

923
01:13:09,070 --> 01:13:13,632
In that case, to a delightful
weekend in the country.

924
01:13:13,741 --> 01:13:15,641
<i>Oh, splendid!</i>

925
01:13:19,514 --> 01:13:22,312
We expected a volley of
argument concerning Mr. Redgrave.

926
01:13:22,416 --> 01:13:26,079
- We're forgetting about Jake...
- Not another word.

927
01:13:26,187 --> 01:13:28,382
Not another word. Jake can wait too.

928
01:13:28,489 --> 01:13:31,947
Jake isn't a friend, Monty. I'd
hoped to avoid telling you this,

929
01:13:32,059 --> 01:13:34,823
but there's a psychotic on
the prowl outside this house.

930
01:13:34,929 --> 01:13:38,763
Ask him if I exaggerate. He's
threatened us, and he's dangerous.

931
01:13:38,866 --> 01:13:40,891
Is this true?

932
01:13:41,002 --> 01:13:44,062
Well, there's this
local type hanging about.

933
01:13:44,171 --> 01:13:48,631
A poacher. We got into a tiff, and
he threatened me with a dead fish.

934
01:13:48,743 --> 01:13:51,507
Yes, it was rather amusing, actually.

935
01:13:51,612 --> 01:13:54,809
<i>When you came in, we thought it was him.</i>

936
01:13:54,916 --> 01:13:59,012
And we thought that you
cleaning your boots...

937
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:01,020
was him sharpening his knife.

938
01:14:03,824 --> 01:14:06,952
Oh, how delicious.

939
01:14:07,061 --> 01:14:10,588
Mmm, more meat?

940
01:14:10,698 --> 01:14:13,166
No, thank you. I'll go out for a walk.

941
01:14:13,267 --> 01:14:17,294
Oh, wait for us to finish,
dear boy. We'll all go.

942
01:14:19,740 --> 01:14:23,836
Listen, I know what you're
thinking, but I had no alternative.

943
01:14:23,945 --> 01:14:26,709
The old bugger's come a long way, and
I didn't want to put the wind up him.

944
01:14:26,814 --> 01:14:28,975
Your sensitivity overwhelms me.

945
01:14:29,083 --> 01:14:32,610
If you think you're gonna have a
weekend's indulgence at his expense,

946
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:35,280
which means him having a
weekend's indulgence at my expense,

947
01:14:35,389 --> 01:14:37,619
- you've got another thing coming.
- I give you my word.

948
01:14:37,725 --> 01:14:40,489
- We'll leave first thing tomorrow morning.
- Tomorrow? What about tonight?

949
01:14:40,595 --> 01:14:42,995
- He's not gonna try anything.
- Of course he is!

950
01:14:43,097 --> 01:14:46,931
- He means business.
- Anyway, he sent me out to tell you coffee's ready.

951
01:14:47,034 --> 01:14:50,435
I couldn't drink it. I've got a
cramp in the mouth from grinning.

952
01:14:50,538 --> 01:14:53,006
- Well, stop smiling at him.
- I can't help it.

953
01:14:53,107 --> 01:14:56,201
I'm so uptight with
him, I can't stop myself.

954
01:14:58,379 --> 01:15:02,179
<i>"Laisse-moir respirir,</i>

955
01:15:02,249 --> 01:15:07,152
<i>longtemps longtemps L
'odeur de tes cheveux. "</i>

956
01:15:07,254 --> 01:15:10,417
Ah, Baudelaire.

957
01:15:10,524 --> 01:15:14,187
Brings back such memories of Oxford!

958
01:15:14,295 --> 01:15:16,286
Oh, Oxford!

959
01:15:16,397 --> 01:15:19,924
<i>Followed by yet another anecdote
about his sensitive crimes...</i>

960
01:15:20,034 --> 01:15:22,195
<i>in a punt with a chap called Norman...</i>

961
01:15:22,303 --> 01:15:24,203
<i>who had red hair and a book of poetry...</i>

962
01:15:24,305 --> 01:15:26,432
<i>stained with the butter
drips from crumpets.</i>

963
01:15:26,540 --> 01:15:29,634
I often wonder where Norman is now.

964
01:15:29,744 --> 01:15:32,042
Probably wintering with
his mother in Guildford.

965
01:15:32,146 --> 01:15:34,046
A cat and rain.

966
01:15:34,148 --> 01:15:36,048
Vim under the sink.

967
01:15:36,150 --> 01:15:39,176
And both bars on.

968
01:15:39,286 --> 01:15:42,187
But old now... old.

969
01:15:42,289 --> 01:15:44,951
There can be no true
beauty without decay.

970
01:15:45,059 --> 01:15:50,554
"A requiem for England. "
- How right you are. How right you are.

971
01:15:50,665 --> 01:15:54,157
We live in a kingdom of rains...

972
01:15:54,268 --> 01:15:58,068
where royalty comes in gangs.

973
01:15:58,172 --> 01:16:01,505
Come on, lads. Let's get home.
The sky is beginning to bruise.

974
01:16:01,609 --> 01:16:05,136
Night must fall, and we
shall be forced to camp.

975
01:16:06,781 --> 01:16:09,341
He's not in my room, all right?
That's the condition, all right?

976
01:16:09,450 --> 01:16:11,918
- All right.
- I want the room with the lock. Agree to that, or I'm off.

977
01:16:12,019 --> 01:16:13,919
All right. All right.

978
01:16:21,328 --> 01:16:25,264
<i>Good ol'Jake, eh? I told you. He's back.</i>

979
01:16:25,366 --> 01:16:28,267
And that's precisely the
reason I'm off to London.

980
01:16:28,369 --> 01:16:31,065
Let's all have a good
laugh, eh, Withnail?

981
01:16:31,172 --> 01:16:34,266
Good ol'Jake is back.

982
01:16:34,375 --> 01:16:36,809
He's going away. He's leaving.

983
01:16:36,911 --> 01:16:40,108
Come on. Let's pack up and get
out of here before it gets dark.

984
01:16:57,598 --> 01:17:01,329
"Here hare, here. "

985
01:17:02,436 --> 01:17:04,700
"Here hare, here. "

986
01:17:04,805 --> 01:17:06,705
Good ol'Jake.

987
01:17:16,050 --> 01:17:21,010
<i>Ace bets. Ace bets two
and it's over to you.</i>

988
01:17:21,088 --> 01:17:24,785
Your two and up two.

989
01:17:24,892 --> 01:17:26,792
<i>- Mmm.
- So that's four?</i>

990
01:17:26,894 --> 01:17:29,089
That's four.

991
01:17:31,031 --> 01:17:36,594
<i>- Four.
- This is for the raise. We'll see the two.</i>

992
01:17:36,704 --> 01:17:39,639
Now, last card up.

993
01:17:39,740 --> 01:17:41,765
"Looking a bit lonely, isn't he?"

994
01:17:41,876 --> 01:17:44,902
" He needs a queen to
come to the rescue. "

995
01:17:47,381 --> 01:17:50,111
And... oh!

996
01:17:53,087 --> 01:17:55,647
There she is.

997
01:17:55,756 --> 01:17:59,192
Oh!

998
01:18:03,430 --> 01:18:06,558
Well, it's the two queens to beat.

999
01:18:20,581 --> 01:18:22,776
Another hand?

1000
01:18:26,654 --> 01:18:29,623
I think we'd better get him to bed.

1001
01:18:29,723 --> 01:18:32,157
No, no. He's down here.

1002
01:18:34,528 --> 01:18:36,758
You're in my room, I'm in
his room and he's down here.

1003
01:18:36,864 --> 01:18:40,960
I wouldn't dream of depriving the dear fellow
of his bed, especially in that condition.

1004
01:18:41,068 --> 01:18:43,764
- But it's agreed. It's what he wants.
- No, I don't.

1005
01:18:43,871 --> 01:18:45,771
I wanna get to bed.

1006
01:18:47,341 --> 01:18:50,310
All right then, lovey.
Let's get you to bed.

1007
01:18:50,411 --> 01:18:52,845
Early night will do us both good.

1008
01:18:54,982 --> 01:18:59,078
<i>- Night-night, then,
Monty. - I want to be alone!</i>

1009
01:19:01,856 --> 01:19:03,756
I wanna be alone.

1010
01:19:26,213 --> 01:19:28,773
I think he'd better sleep alone tonight.

1011
01:19:30,918 --> 01:19:35,355
- He doesn't want to sleep with you.
- Right.

1012
01:19:35,456 --> 01:19:38,948
Well, you're in there,

1013
01:19:39,059 --> 01:19:41,527
and I'll take these
and I'll have the couch.

1014
01:19:43,030 --> 01:19:45,464
I'll say good night, then, Monty.

1015
01:19:45,566 --> 01:19:49,798
You already have... twice.

1016
01:20:18,399 --> 01:20:21,960
What is it, Monty? I'm terribly
tired. I need to go to sleep.

1017
01:20:22,069 --> 01:20:25,505
<i>But not that tired, eh?</i>

1018
01:20:30,644 --> 01:20:35,638
- Are you a sponge or a stone?
- What do you mean?

1019
01:20:35,749 --> 01:20:39,241
<i>Do you like to experience
all facets of life?</i>

1020
01:20:39,353 --> 01:20:42,845
Or do you shut yourself
off from new experience?

1021
01:20:42,957 --> 01:20:45,221
<i>- I voted Conservative.
- Are you faithful?</i>

1022
01:20:45,326 --> 01:20:48,762
- To whom?
- Faithfulness isn't selective.

1023
01:20:48,862 --> 01:20:52,798
<i>I agree. It's more a question of
selecting to whom one will be faithful.</i>

1024
01:20:52,900 --> 01:20:57,098
- Have you selected?
- I'm terribly tired.

1025
01:20:57,204 --> 01:21:01,140
I've been watching you all evening.

1026
01:21:01,241 --> 01:21:04,404
You've been avoiding
my eyes, haven't you?

1027
01:21:04,511 --> 01:21:06,911
- Your eyes?
- Mmm.

1028
01:21:07,014 --> 01:21:10,381
At luncheon, you couldn't
tear your gaze from mine.

1029
01:21:10,484 --> 01:21:13,044
This evening, you barely looked at me.

1030
01:21:13,153 --> 01:21:15,314
What did he say to you?

1031
01:21:15,422 --> 01:21:18,289
<i>- Nothing.
- You can tell me.</i>

1032
01:21:18,392 --> 01:21:21,020
I assure you, nothing, M-Monty.

1033
01:21:21,128 --> 01:21:25,030
I'm terribly tired. I need to go to bed.

1034
01:21:25,132 --> 01:21:28,067
<i>Yes, you must, mustn't you?</i>

1035
01:21:28,168 --> 01:21:30,796
Off you go, then.

1036
01:21:30,904 --> 01:21:32,997
I'll sleep here.

1037
01:21:33,107 --> 01:21:37,134
It won't be the first time
I've been left with the couch.

1038
01:21:54,054 --> 01:21:56,545
Boy.

1039
01:21:58,459 --> 01:22:01,257
Boy.

1040
01:22:01,361 --> 01:22:05,388
I know you're not asleep, boy.

1041
01:22:05,499 --> 01:22:09,333
<i>But he is.</i>

1042
01:22:09,436 --> 01:22:13,031
I've been into his room.

1043
01:22:13,140 --> 01:22:15,938
He won't hear a thing.

1044
01:22:18,912 --> 01:22:20,812
I know you're not asleep, boy.

1045
01:22:20,914 --> 01:22:24,077
No, I'm not. What is it, Monty?

1046
01:22:24,184 --> 01:22:28,143
What do you want?

1047
01:22:28,255 --> 01:22:32,089
I had to come. I tried not to.

1048
01:22:32,192 --> 01:22:34,820
Oh, how I tried not to.

1049
01:22:34,928 --> 01:22:37,226
Monty, there's something
I have to explain to you.

1050
01:22:37,331 --> 01:22:39,731
You needn't explain.
He's told me everything.

1051
01:22:39,833 --> 01:22:41,733
He told me that first
day you came to Chelsea.

1052
01:22:41,835 --> 01:22:46,363
- What's he told you?
- He told me about your arrest in the Tottenham Court Road.

1053
01:22:46,473 --> 01:22:48,941
He told me about your problems,

1054
01:22:49,042 --> 01:22:51,772
how you feel, your desires.

1055
01:22:51,879 --> 01:22:55,610
- Problems? What problems?
- You are a toilet trader.

1056
01:22:55,716 --> 01:22:58,344
- He told you that?
- You mustn't blame him.

1057
01:22:58,452 --> 01:23:02,616
You mustn't blame yourself. I know
how you feel and how difficult it is.

1058
01:23:02,723 --> 01:23:07,990
And that's why you mustn't hold back, let
it ruin your youth as I nearly did over Eric.

1059
01:23:08,095 --> 01:23:11,155
It's like a tide. Give in to it, boy.

1060
01:23:11,265 --> 01:23:15,668
Go with it. It's
society's crime, not ours.

1061
01:23:15,769 --> 01:23:18,897
- I'm not homosexual, Monty.
- Yes, you are!

1062
01:23:19,006 --> 01:23:22,737
Of course you are. You're simply
blackmailing your emotions...

1063
01:23:22,843 --> 01:23:25,505
to avoid the realities of
your relationship with him.

1064
01:23:25,612 --> 01:23:28,740
- What are you talking about?
- You love him.

1065
01:23:28,849 --> 01:23:31,249
And it isn't his fault
he cannot love you...

1066
01:23:31,351 --> 01:23:34,377
any more than it's
mine that I adore you.

1067
01:23:38,158 --> 01:23:41,321
Couldn't we allow ourselves just
this one moment of indiscretion?

1068
01:23:41,428 --> 01:23:43,328
- No!
- He need never know.

1069
01:23:43,430 --> 01:23:46,524
I don't care what he knows! Monty,
you've gotta go! You've gotta leave!

1070
01:23:46,633 --> 01:23:49,158
If you want to humiliate
me, humiliate me.

1071
01:23:49,269 --> 01:23:51,203
I adore you.

1072
01:23:51,305 --> 01:23:54,001
Tell him, if you must. I no longer care.

1073
01:23:54,107 --> 01:23:58,066
I mean to have you, even
if it must be burglary!

1074
01:23:59,913 --> 01:24:01,813
It's not me, it's him!

1075
01:24:07,855 --> 01:24:10,380
He lied to you. We're an affair.

1076
01:24:10,490 --> 01:24:13,220
We have been for years, but
he doesn't want you to know.

1077
01:24:13,327 --> 01:24:17,229
He doesn't want anybody to know. We're
both in it. We're obsessed with each other.

1078
01:24:17,331 --> 01:24:20,960
But he's ashamed. He refuses to
come out and accept what he is.

1079
01:24:21,068 --> 01:24:23,866
That's why he's rejecting
me while you're here.

1080
01:24:23,971 --> 01:24:28,738
On my life, Monty, this is the first night
we haven't slept together for six years.

1081
01:24:28,842 --> 01:24:30,867
I can't cheat on him. It would kill him.

1082
01:24:30,978 --> 01:24:34,414
But he told me you were in purgatory
because he couldn't love you.

1083
01:24:34,514 --> 01:24:37,506
<i>He's lying. Lying!</i>

1084
01:24:37,618 --> 01:24:41,884
Oh, my dear boy.

1085
01:24:41,989 --> 01:24:45,117
If I had known that, I would never
have attempted to come between you.

1086
01:24:45,225 --> 01:24:47,659
I know that, Monty.

1087
01:24:47,761 --> 01:24:50,229
I respect you for your sensitivity.

1088
01:24:50,330 --> 01:24:52,594
I thank you for it,

1089
01:24:52,699 --> 01:24:54,963
but you must leave.

1090
01:24:57,204 --> 01:25:00,332
Yes.

1091
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:03,807
Yes. You'd better go to him.

1092
01:25:03,911 --> 01:25:06,106
Oh, I intend to.

1093
01:25:06,213 --> 01:25:08,340
This instant.

1094
01:25:08,782 --> 01:25:12,115
<i>Withnail, you bastard. Wake up.</i>

1095
01:25:12,185 --> 01:25:17,213
Wake up, you bastard, or I'll
burn this bastard bed down.

1096
01:25:17,324 --> 01:25:21,784
I deny all accusations.
What do you want?

1097
01:25:21,895 --> 01:25:24,125
I have just narrowly
avoided having a buggering.

1098
01:25:24,231 --> 01:25:27,200
I've come in here with the express
intention of wishing one on you.

1099
01:25:27,301 --> 01:25:29,861
Having said that, I now
intend to leave for London.

1100
01:25:29,970 --> 01:25:32,495
Hold on. Don't let your
imagination run away with you.

1101
01:25:32,606 --> 01:25:34,904
Imagination? I just finished
fighting a naked man.

1102
01:25:35,008 --> 01:25:37,476
How dare you tell him
I'm a toilet trader!

1103
01:25:37,577 --> 01:25:40,137
It was a tactical necessity.

1104
01:25:40,247 --> 01:25:43,080
If I hadn't told him you were active,
we'd never have got the cottage.

1105
01:25:43,183 --> 01:25:45,083
I never have wanted
it... not with him in it!

1106
01:25:45,185 --> 01:25:48,951
Geez. He'd come all this way.

1107
01:25:49,056 --> 01:25:53,356
<i>- Monty? He'd go to New York.
- It was a calculated risk.</i>

1108
01:25:53,460 --> 01:25:56,054
What is all this tactical
necessity and calculated risk?

1109
01:25:56,163 --> 01:25:58,859
This is me naked in a corner!

1110
01:25:58,966 --> 01:26:01,560
And how dare you tell him I love you.

1111
01:26:01,668 --> 01:26:04,501
And how dare you tell
him you rejected me.

1112
01:26:04,604 --> 01:26:07,539
<i>- How dare you tell him that!
- Sorry about that.</i>

1113
01:26:07,641 --> 01:26:11,008
Got a bit carried away. Sort
of said it without thinking.

1114
01:26:11,111 --> 01:26:14,638
<i>Let me tell you something, Withnail. If
he comes into my room again, it's murder,</i>

1115
01:26:14,748 --> 01:26:17,740
and you will be held responsible in law.

1116
01:26:23,690 --> 01:26:26,887
"Perhaps it is appropriate
justice for the eavesdropper...

1117
01:26:26,994 --> 01:26:30,361
"that he should leave as
his trade determines...

1118
01:26:30,464 --> 01:26:34,560
"in secrecy and in the dead of night.

1119
01:26:34,668 --> 01:26:38,365
<i>- "I do sincerely hope that
you will find the happiness...</i>

1120
01:26:38,472 --> 01:26:42,033
"which, alas, has
always been denied to me.

1121
01:26:43,977 --> 01:26:47,037
"I am yours ever faithfully,

1122
01:26:47,147 --> 01:26:49,047
Montague H. Withnail. "

1123
01:26:50,751 --> 01:26:53,185
Poor old bastard.

1124
01:26:53,286 --> 01:26:55,186
I would say...

1125
01:26:56,723 --> 01:27:00,819
that that represents
a degree of hypocrisy...

1126
01:27:00,927 --> 01:27:05,523
I've hitherto suspected in you but not
noticed, due to highly evasive skills.

1127
01:27:05,632 --> 01:27:09,591
Christ, Withnail.
You'll suffer for this.

1128
01:27:09,703 --> 01:27:12,137
What you have done will
have to be paid for.

1129
01:27:12,239 --> 01:27:14,207
I will say one thing for Monty.

1130
01:27:14,307 --> 01:27:16,502
He keeps a sensational cellar.

1131
01:27:26,319 --> 01:27:28,947
<i>- Who's there?
- Telegram.</i>

1132
01:27:52,946 --> 01:27:55,380
Well done.

1133
01:27:55,482 --> 01:27:59,384
Well, it doesn't mean to say I've got it.
They probably just want to see me again.

1134
01:28:02,355 --> 01:28:05,415
Well, that settles it, then.
We'll leave immediately.

1135
01:28:05,525 --> 01:28:08,289
What?

1136
01:28:08,395 --> 01:28:11,558
- Get your kit together. We're leaving in half an hour.
- Half an hour?

1137
01:28:11,665 --> 01:28:14,566
Don't be ridiculous. I need
at least an hour for lunch.

1138
01:28:23,343 --> 01:28:27,302
You've got a truck coming
up. About 200 yards.

1139
01:28:27,414 --> 01:28:31,009
Followed by a left slow hander.

1140
01:28:31,118 --> 01:28:33,951
This is insanity! I can't keep this up!

1141
01:28:34,054 --> 01:28:37,615
Stay in this lane.
Bear right. Bear right.

1142
01:28:37,724 --> 01:28:40,284
What lane? What lane? I
can't see the fucking lane.

1143
01:28:40,393 --> 01:28:42,827
Bear right! Bear right! Bear right!

1144
01:28:45,799 --> 01:28:50,202
That's it. Next garage, I've gotta
do something about that wiper.

1145
01:28:50,303 --> 01:28:54,034
And I've got to get some sleep.

1146
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:24,201
- What's going on?
- I'm making time.

1147
01:29:38,251 --> 01:29:41,687
<i>Are you out of your mind? Pull
over. You haven't got a license.</i>

1148
01:29:41,788 --> 01:29:43,756
No. I'm making time.

1149
01:29:54,267 --> 01:29:56,667
- Where are we?
- We're approaching London.

1150
01:29:59,839 --> 01:30:04,105
- Here comes another fucker.

1151
01:30:12,219 --> 01:30:14,847
- Oh, no!

1152
01:30:14,955 --> 01:30:17,822
Perfectly all right. Leave him to me.

1153
01:30:17,924 --> 01:30:20,722
You're full of scotch, you silly tool.

1154
01:31:31,331 --> 01:31:34,789
A bit early in the morning
for festivities, isn't it?

1155
01:31:34,901 --> 01:31:37,199
These aren't mine. They belong to him.

1156
01:31:37,304 --> 01:31:41,104
- You're drunk.
- I assure you I'm not, officer.

1157
01:31:41,207 --> 01:31:44,472
Honestly, I've only had a few ales.

1158
01:31:44,577 --> 01:31:48,570
Out of the car... please.

1159
01:31:48,682 --> 01:31:50,582
Sir.

1160
01:31:57,624 --> 01:32:00,559
I want you to take one deep
breath and fill this bag.

1161
01:32:02,162 --> 01:32:05,859
- Are you refusing to fill this bag?
- I most certainly am.

1162
01:32:05,965 --> 01:32:09,196
- I'm placing you under arrest.
- Don't be ridiculous. I haven't done anything.

1163
01:32:09,302 --> 01:32:11,497
- Come on.
- Look here, my cousin's a QC.

1164
01:32:11,604 --> 01:32:13,504
Get in the back of the van!

1165
01:32:26,619 --> 01:32:29,019
Hey, sarge, what's that clown doing?

1166
01:33:04,824 --> 01:33:08,225
- Where's our checks?
- Didn't sign on.

1167
01:33:08,328 --> 01:33:11,559
That wouldn't make any difference
in last week's payments.

1168
01:33:39,826 --> 01:33:42,590
What are you doing in my bed?

1169
01:33:42,695 --> 01:33:47,189
- I've been asleep.
- Who is the huge spade in the bath?

1170
01:33:47,300 --> 01:33:49,700
Presuming Ed.

1171
01:33:49,803 --> 01:33:52,670
You've got ten minutes, right? I
want you out 'cause I want to get in.

1172
01:33:52,772 --> 01:33:55,400
Ten minutes, right? You
better be on your feet.

1173
01:33:58,778 --> 01:34:01,975
- How did you get in?
- Ingenuity, man.

1174
01:34:02,081 --> 01:34:04,345
Come up the drain pipe.

1175
01:34:04,451 --> 01:34:07,511
- Would you like a smoke?
- Yes.

1176
01:34:07,620 --> 01:34:10,054
No, thanks. I've got a call to make.

1177
01:34:14,561 --> 01:34:16,495
What are you gonna do with those?

1178
01:34:16,596 --> 01:34:20,930
The joint I'm about to
roll requires a craftsman.

1179
01:34:21,034 --> 01:34:23,525
It can utilize up to 12 skins.

1180
01:34:23,636 --> 01:34:26,605
It is called a Camberwell Carrot.

1181
01:34:26,706 --> 01:34:29,106
It's impossible to use
12 papers in one joint.

1182
01:34:29,209 --> 01:34:32,906
It's impossible to make a
Camberwell Carrot with anything less.

1183
01:34:33,012 --> 01:34:35,776
- Who says it's a Camberwell Carrot?
- I do.

1184
01:34:35,882 --> 01:34:39,682
I invented it in Camberwell,
and it looks like a carrot.

1185
01:34:39,786 --> 01:34:42,880
Do you realize this gaff's
overwhelmed with rodents?

1186
01:34:42,989 --> 01:34:45,549
When I come in, I seen one
the size of a fucking dog.

1187
01:34:45,658 --> 01:34:48,786
<i>That is a dog. Belongs
to the fellow downstairs.</i>

1188
01:34:48,895 --> 01:34:51,056
Does his dog get in the oven?

1189
01:34:51,164 --> 01:34:54,395
- No, his dog doesn't come up here.
- Then it was a rodent.

1190
01:34:54,501 --> 01:34:57,698
Opened the oven door, and it
was in there looking at me.

1191
01:34:57,804 --> 01:35:02,070
Quite freaked me at the
time. I was gonna cook onions.

1192
01:35:02,175 --> 01:35:04,370
- Are you going to bed now?
- No.

1193
01:35:04,477 --> 01:35:06,377
Phone.

1194
01:35:08,548 --> 01:35:11,540
- Who's he going to telephone?
- Squat Betty.

1195
01:35:13,019 --> 01:35:16,386
His agent. He's wasting his
time because he won't be in.

1196
01:35:40,413 --> 01:35:43,610
This'll tend to make you very high.

1197
01:35:46,853 --> 01:35:51,381
This grass is the most powerful
in the Western Hemisphere.

1198
01:35:51,491 --> 01:35:55,621
I have it specially flown
in from my man in Mexico.

1199
01:35:57,096 --> 01:35:59,394
He's an expert.

1200
01:35:59,499 --> 01:36:01,967
His name is Juan.

1201
01:36:02,068 --> 01:36:07,165
This grass grows at exactly
2,000 feet above sea level.

1202
01:36:09,409 --> 01:36:11,741
You got the part, man?

1203
01:36:16,282 --> 01:36:20,651
I got a different one. They
want me to play the lead.

1204
01:36:20,753 --> 01:36:24,587
- Congratulations.
- Where exactly have you two been?

1205
01:36:24,691 --> 01:36:28,855
- Holiday in the countryside.
- That's a very good idea.

1206
01:36:28,962 --> 01:36:31,954
London is a country
coming down from its trip.

1207
01:36:32,065 --> 01:36:36,263
<i>We are 91 days from
the end of this decade,</i>

1208
01:36:36,369 --> 01:36:39,497
and there's gonna be a lot of refugees.

1209
01:36:42,408 --> 01:36:46,708
They'll be goin' round this town
shoutin', "Bring out your dead. "

1210
01:36:48,982 --> 01:36:52,076
There was a geezer around here
the other day lookin' for you.

1211
01:36:52,185 --> 01:36:54,449
<i>- What geezer?
- Some bald geezer.</i>

1212
01:36:54,554 --> 01:36:58,888
Reckons you owe him 266 quid back rent.

1213
01:36:58,992 --> 01:37:03,986
I told him there's no question of payin'
rent on a property cut with rodents.

1214
01:37:04,097 --> 01:37:06,224
He takes exception to this.

1215
01:37:06,332 --> 01:37:08,823
Starts comin' on really bald with me.

1216
01:37:08,935 --> 01:37:12,302
- You mean ratty.
- I told him to piss off.

1217
01:37:12,405 --> 01:37:14,635
You bloody fool. We'll
end up in court again.

1218
01:37:14,741 --> 01:37:18,177
<i>- No we won't. It ain't legal.
- I assume we can quote you.</i>

1219
01:37:18,277 --> 01:37:21,940
The law rather appeals to me, actually.

1220
01:37:27,153 --> 01:37:30,145
<i>Just high.</i>

1221
01:37:31,958 --> 01:37:33,858
Stop laughing, Withnail.
This is serious.

1222
01:37:33,960 --> 01:37:37,794
No, it ain't. I looked
into it, studied the papers.

1223
01:37:37,897 --> 01:37:40,957
- What papers?
- Legal papers.

1224
01:37:41,067 --> 01:37:43,695
<i>What papers, Danny?</i>

1225
01:37:53,746 --> 01:37:56,977
He's got our checks. What
are you doing with these?

1226
01:37:57,083 --> 01:38:00,712
<i>I was gonna cash 'em in for you.</i>

1227
01:38:08,828 --> 01:38:12,821
For Christ's sake, Withnail, stop
laughing. This is a notice of eviction.

1228
01:38:19,939 --> 01:38:22,237
Will you stop laughing?
They wanna throw us out.

1229
01:38:24,544 --> 01:38:27,945
For God... Will you shut up, for
God's sake? You're giving me the fear.

1230
01:38:28,047 --> 01:38:30,106
<i>Give me a downer, Danny.
My brain's capsizing.</i>

1231
01:38:30,216 --> 01:38:32,343
- I've gone and fucked my brain!
- Change, man.

1232
01:38:32,452 --> 01:38:35,853
<i>Find your neutral
space. You've got a rush.</i>

1233
01:38:35,955 --> 01:38:39,118
It will pass. Be seated.

1234
01:38:45,998 --> 01:38:47,898
Aren't you getting absurdly high?

1235
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:51,367
Precisely the reason I'm smokin' it.

1236
01:38:56,642 --> 01:38:58,667
I couldn't. I'm spaced.

1237
01:38:58,778 --> 01:39:00,803
Not as spaced as your rodents.

1238
01:39:00,913 --> 01:39:05,043
- Don't talk about them.
- I imagine they're talkin' to each other.

1239
01:39:07,453 --> 01:39:09,887
<i>- What do you mean?
- I've dealt with 'em.</i>

1240
01:39:09,989 --> 01:39:11,889
Dealt with 'em. What
the fuck do you mean?

1241
01:39:11,991 --> 01:39:15,654
Dosed 'em. I expect
they're dead down the drain.

1242
01:39:15,762 --> 01:39:18,731
Dead down the drain? What
have you done to them?

1243
01:39:18,831 --> 01:39:22,289
Given them all drugged onions.

1244
01:39:22,401 --> 01:39:25,234
Jesus Christ! Why have
you drugged their onions?

1245
01:39:25,338 --> 01:39:28,501
Sit down, man. Take control.

1246
01:39:28,608 --> 01:39:31,338
Give me a Valium. I'm getting the fear!

1247
01:39:31,444 --> 01:39:33,742
<i>You have done something to your brain.</i>

1248
01:39:33,846 --> 01:39:35,746
You have made it high.

1249
01:39:35,848 --> 01:39:40,785
If I lay ten mils of Diazepam on you,
you will do something else to your brain.

1250
01:39:40,887 --> 01:39:45,085
You will make it low. Why trust
one drug and not the other?

1251
01:39:45,191 --> 01:39:47,091
That's politics, isn't it?

1252
01:39:47,193 --> 01:39:49,093
I'm gonna eat some sugar.

1253
01:39:50,696 --> 01:39:53,426
I recommend you smoke some more grass.

1254
01:39:53,533 --> 01:39:56,161
No way. No fucking way.

1255
01:39:56,269 --> 01:39:59,568
That is an unfortunate
political decision,

1256
01:39:59,672 --> 01:40:02,072
reflectin' these times.

1257
01:40:09,248 --> 01:40:11,808
<i>- What are you talking about, Danny?
- Politics, man.</i>

1258
01:40:11,918 --> 01:40:14,443
If you were hanging
on to a rising balloon,

1259
01:40:14,554 --> 01:40:17,216
you're presented with
a difficult decision...

1260
01:40:17,323 --> 01:40:19,689
let go before it's too late?

1261
01:40:19,792 --> 01:40:21,783
Or hang on and keep getting higher?

1262
01:40:21,894 --> 01:40:26,524
Posing the question, how long
can you keep a grip on the rope?

1263
01:40:28,467 --> 01:40:31,163
They're sellin' hippie
wigs in Woolworth's, man.

1264
01:40:32,705 --> 01:40:36,869
<i>The greatest decade in the
history of mankind is over.</i>

1265
01:40:38,744 --> 01:40:42,771
And as Presuming Ed here has
so consistently pointed out...

1266
01:40:43,883 --> 01:40:47,080
we have failed to paint it black.

1267
01:41:37,136 --> 01:41:40,196
My Dad'll pick up the boxes in a week.

1268
01:41:40,306 --> 01:41:42,570
And he's gonna do
something about the car.

1269
01:41:44,677 --> 01:41:46,668
- I'm off now.
- Already?

1270
01:41:46,779 --> 01:41:49,304
But I've got us a bottle open.

1271
01:41:51,050 --> 01:41:53,416
I confiscated it from Monty's supplies.

1272
01:41:54,587 --> 01:41:57,715
'53 Margaux. Best of the century.

1273
01:41:58,991 --> 01:42:01,289
I'm sure he wouldn't
resent us a parting drink.

1274
01:42:01,394 --> 01:42:04,557
I can't, Withnail. I've gotta
walk to the station. I'll be late.

1275
01:42:04,664 --> 01:42:07,792
- There's always time for a drink.
- No.

1276
01:42:07,900 --> 01:42:10,232
I don't have the time.

1277
01:42:10,336 --> 01:42:13,999
All right. I'll walk
with you through the park.

1278
01:42:16,008 --> 01:42:18,408
We can drink it on the way.

1279
01:42:26,519 --> 01:42:29,044
No. No more, thank you.

1280
01:42:29,155 --> 01:42:31,646
Listen, Withnail. It's a
stinker. Why don't you go back?

1281
01:42:31,757 --> 01:42:34,692
- Because I wanna walk you to the station.
- Well, don't.

1282
01:42:34,794 --> 01:42:37,262
Please don't.

1283
01:42:37,363 --> 01:42:39,422
I really don't want you to.

1284
01:42:48,474 --> 01:42:51,932
I shall miss you, Withnail.

1285
01:42:52,044 --> 01:42:56,674
<i>I shall miss you too. Chin-chin.</i>

1286
01:43:15,134 --> 01:43:18,695
"I have of late, but
