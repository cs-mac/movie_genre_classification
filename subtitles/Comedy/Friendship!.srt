2
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,500
"The GDR!"

3
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,260
"The German Democratic Republic!"

4
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:19,460
"The socialist state of
workers and farmers."

5
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:24,340
"We were all the same. We all
had the same apartments."

6
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,260
"We all looked the same."

7
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:30,260
"We all ate the same food."

8
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:33,140
"We knew what everyone else knew."

9
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,620
"Our agents were the most
secret agents in the whole world."

10
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,820
"We were the world's best drivers."

11
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:45,900
"Our accident rate was so low,
that we could drive cardboard cars."

12
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,740
"Our secretaries played
sports with us."

13
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,220
"We liked to dance."

14
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,380
"We liked to march."

15
00:01:55,660 --> 00:02:00,100
"We were all awfully
fond of the GDR!"

16
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:05,060
"A country that other countries
could only dream of."

17
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:10,660
"I am Tom. The country that others
could only dream of -"

18
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:14,380
"- and I were always at odds,
ever since the beginning."

19
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,580
(Alle:) GDR!
Come on!

20
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,620
"I didn't like the dress code."

21
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:24,100
"And the GDR didn't like that
I didn't like the dress code."

22
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,940
"When I was 12, I was a passionate
collector of rare objects."

23
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:32,300
"But my country had no appreciation
for my passion."

24
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,700
"Our class consisted
of 23 students."

25
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:41,020
"And my teacher had resolved that
I would never amount to anything."

26
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,740
"But then Veit joined our class."

27
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:49,180
Friendship!
(All:) Friendship!

28
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:54,740
"Immediately after the death of his
father, he and his mother moved to Berlin."

29
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:58,220
"She had him sit next to me."

30
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:02,300
"Veit was just my number.
Veit was my 24th."

31
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:06,100
* Music "Der goldene Reiter"

32
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:10,260
"Veit was reserved, and
didn't talk about earlier"

33
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,780
"Veit was quite different than myself."

34
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:16,020
"Nevertheless, we became
the best of friends."

35
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,820
"We mostly hung out at my place,
listening to Western German radio -"

36
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,820
"- and making stupid movies."

37
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,220
Oh shit!

38
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:34,460
"And the GDR and I were
still at odds."

39
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:38,100
"I had a different perception
of freedom."

40
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:41,260
"I had a different
perception of life."

41
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,580
"I had a different perception
of everything."

42
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,700
"Then came the autumn of 1989."

43
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,460
"Great political upheavals
were in progress."

44
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,580
"And the whole world was
watching the GDR."

45
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:57,740
"And David Haselhoff brought
down the Berlin Wall."

46
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,740
* Hasselhoff: "Looking for Freedom". *

47
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,380
And what now?

48
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,780
I'm going to San Francisco.

49
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,740
What are you going to
do in San Francisco?

50
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,340
I want to see the Golden Gate Bridge.
What?

51
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,580
I want to see the Golden Gate Bridge.
What?

52
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,660
It's the westernmost point
in the world.

53
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,820
After that, there's only water.
And Asia.

54
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:26,660
"For 23 years, the westernmost point
I had visited was Wernigerode."

55
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,980
"All of a sudden, I realized:"

56
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,820
"There's no place in the whole world,
that I would rather see -"

57
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:38,740
"- than the Golden Gate Bridge,
the westernmost point in the world."

58
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:43,500
"The place where I would be
the furthest removed from the DDR."    Okay!

59
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,940
I'm coming with.

60
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:52,340
My father said:
You guys are crazy.

61
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:57,140
And my mother said:
You can't even speak English.

62
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:01,060
"Moreover, my father hinted
at his skepticism."

63
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:03,700
That's a total load of shit!

64
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:09,220
"For our entire lives we had lived
in the same country."

65
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:13,580
"Now we could finally go,
wherever we wanted."

66
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:18,700
"Unfortunately, we didn't have enough
money for 2 tickets to San Francisco."

67
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,420
"Rather, only for New York."

68
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,860
"And so, we began our journey."

69
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:29,540
"With 55 dollars in the bag,
a pullover, 3 pairs of briefs, -"

70
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,860
"- socks and soap."

71
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,740
"And our perfect English."

72
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:40,340
Friendship!
(All:) Friendship!

73
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,740
Madness, dude! Madness!

74
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,220
Next!

75
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,750
<i>Paperwork.</i>

76
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,820
Friendship!
Friendship!

77
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,030
<i>Germany, huh?</i>

78
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,460
Yes.
Yes.

79
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:32,260
- <i>You're a Nazi.</i>
- No, no, no.

80
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,860
No Nazi.
We are communists, you know?

81
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,940
Free communists, yes?
Free! Frei!

82
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,660
Communists!

83
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,820
Yeah, screw the communists!

84
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,700
Ill-conceived, yeah?

85
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,260
Greg!

86
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,820
Shouldn't we explain instead?

87
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:04,260
Can you not just shut up?

88
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,500
You sure?
I'm sure!

89
00:07:08,651 --> 00:07:12,558
<i>- Um, sorry, mister officer,
this is, you know -</i>

90
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,322
<i>- we do films...
- Back against the wall!</i>

91
00:07:14,405 --> 00:07:20,461
<i>- Movies, you know? Money, money, money...
- Back against the wall!!!</i>

92
00:07:22,499 --> 00:07:24,410
<i>Face the wall!!!</i>

93
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,700
Welcome to America.

94
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,980


95
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,280


96
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,840
Did you see how tall the
buildings are here?

97
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,860
What do they do when the
elevator is out of service?

98
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,140
Take the stairs. It's only
50 floors!

99
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:54,300
It'd be night before you finished.
Yeah, for you maybe.

100
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:58,860
Hey, look here!
This guy is skating here!

101
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,180
You're daring, you bird!

102
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:04,860
Hello!    Hello!
How are you, Sir?

103
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,540
Good, fine! Fine, good! Thank you!

104
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,900
New York is a great city and...

105
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:15,140
Veit! He only means to say hello!
That means hello!     Ah!

106
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:18,060
2 Tickets
San Francisco.

107
00:09:18,467 --> 00:09:20,834
<i>That'll be $320</i>

108
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,500
Ach!
Ah!

109
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,700
320 Dollars!

110
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,820
Okay! Here!

111
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:40,500
We don't have anymore.
That's all.

112
00:09:41,675 --> 00:09:43,586
<i>55 Dollars?!</i>

113
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,471
<i>That's two tickets to
New Jersey.</i>

114
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,220
"New Jersey"? Okay!

115
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,660
Where New Jersey?

116
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,660
New Jersey.

117
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:56,820
New York. New Jersey.

118
00:10:00,741 --> 00:10:02,498
<i>Sorry, guys.</i>

119
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,460
Shit!

120
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,860
Shit!
Shit! New Jersey.

121
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,940
Thank you!

122
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:13,900
We'll just show our films,
until we have enough.

123
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,740
San Francisco won't
get away from us.

124
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,780
I'm hungry again,
for a hotdog.

125
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:24,900
I know that, right now, what I
want to eat for the rest of my life.

126
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,700
Isn't that great? Hmm?

127
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,260
You alright?

128
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,500
Yeah, sure!

129
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,420
Look here! Our first
American fan.

130
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:03,580
Stupid dancers!
They're just standing there.

131
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,620
And we only get one
homeless guy. Man!

132
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:10,860
What would happen if we showed
them the film we made of our homeland?

133
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:14,020
No one would be interested
in a documentary.

134
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,340
About our shit homeland?

135
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:20,020
We just need to find a better
place to show it.

136
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:24,100
Yeah! In restaurants or something.
Where people don't have anything -

137
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:27,620
- better to do than watch
the move.

138
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,180
Exactly! Yeah, and better advertising.

139
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,980
"The filmmaker" lives for the
art of making films...

140
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,100
... ging: "go".
It's difficult!

141
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,900
Man! How do you say prison?

142
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,380
Here!
What's that?

143
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,540
Back home I wrote down everything
we could possibly need to say.

144
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,740
Anything that we might need.

145
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,980
I'm impressed, Mr. Kleeberg.
Thanks, Mr. Jagoda!

146
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:59,220
"You have beautiful eyes".
"You have beautiful eyes".

147
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,900
It's possible you could need that.
Oh, look here!

148
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:06,340
"Your eyes shine like the
stars over X."

149
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:10,980
Yeah! Where X stands for whatever
state we're in.

150
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:14,100
"Don't you want to
take off your shirt?"

151
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:18,620
"I'm a lonely communist,
on the search for love."

152
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,700
Yeah, I think it's cool.

153
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:23,940
Here: "I want to fuck
you in the ass."

154
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:27,100
I wrote that down?
Show me!

155
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:31,060
No, you didn't. But you believed
me there for a second.

156
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,940
Woah! Look here! Central Park.

157
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:37,300
Crazy!
Nuts!

158
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:46,076
<i>Got some money?</i>

159
00:12:46,156 --> 00:12:48,874
<i>Ah, no - no money, sorry.</i>

160
00:12:48,957 --> 00:12:52,558
<i>But... here! I have crackers.</i>

161
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,740
Hello? Hey dude!

162
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,820
Those are my crackers.

163
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:01,180
You can't just...
Fine, take the crackers! Shit!

164
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,580
Did you bring more crackers with?

165
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,660
"San Francisco".

166
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,260
What?

167
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,660
Dude! It's so cold!

168
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,700
Give it here!
What's that?

169
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:37,940
What is that?
It's my stuff. I thought:

170
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,940
Your father was dead.

171
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:45,340
Yeah. He is.
And from who are the postcards?

172
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,500
Hey, dude! You have
a father.

173
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,980
You can't just tell me,
that he's dead.

174
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:58,820
I'm your best friend. I'm your best friend!
Leave it alone! You lied to me.

175
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,540
For 10 years. Why didn't
you say anything?

176
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,420
Because I wanted to
forget about him!

177
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:21,620
Shit! My father left us.

178
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,900
When I was 12. Since then, I
haven't heard anything from him.

179
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:31,460
But every year, on my birthday he
sends me a postcard from San Francisco.

180
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,540
Every year!

181
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:37,180
Postmarked on my birthday.

182
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:41,580
My birthday is in 2.5 weeks.
I need to be there.

183
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,580
I need to see him.
You understand?

184
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,660
I want to wait in front
of the post office, where -

185
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:52,300
- he sends these from
That's your plan?

186
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:56,060
Yeah.          You've been lying
to me this entire time.

187
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,660
And then have such a shit plan.

188
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:02,340
I don't have any other.
When were you going to tell me?

189
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:05,740
When we got to San Francisco?
I don't know.

190
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,860
Man! Forget it!

191
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,580
Tom! I was scared, -

192
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,940
- that you wouldn't
have come otherwise!

193
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,380
It's so damned cold here.

194
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:28,020
I saw something over there,
that looked warm.

195
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,660
But it's no hotel.

196
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:34,540
* A woman moans with lust. *

197
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:54,660
Man! I just don't know
what to say to you.

198
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,220
I'm sorry.

199
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,980
Could we hitchhike?

200
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,900
We could do that
in 2.5 weeks.

201
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,340
Hey? We can tackle that.

202
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,460
2.5 weeks.

203
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,260
Come with, Tom!

204
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,900
Please! Please, Tom! Yeah?
Yeah. Okay!

205
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,500
Good. I'll come with. Okay?

206
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,860
But not because of you.

207
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:31,060
But because I want to see the
Golden Gate Bridge.

208
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,980
Oh man! What an ugly car.
Look, there!

209
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:57,180
Hey! He's stopping.
He's stopping. He's stopping

210
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:03,900
Hi! You San Francisco?

211
00:17:05,327 --> 00:17:08,928
<i>No...
I'm not going to San Francisco.</i>

212
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:10,582
<i>Are you foreigners?</i>

213
00:17:12,194 --> 00:17:14,878
<i>That sign! It's not gonna work!</i>

214
00:17:14,956 --> 00:17:17,411
<i>Give me that. Give me that.</i>

215
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:27,303
<i>Ah okay!
DIRECTION San Francisco!</i>

216
00:17:27,385 --> 00:17:28,913
<i>That's better!</i>

217
00:17:28,996 --> 00:17:31,714
<i>Good luck! You're gonna need it.</i>

218
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:36,100
Hey! Wait! Wait! Please!
* He hits the car. *

219
00:17:37,321 --> 00:17:41,228
<i>You: DIRECTION San Francisco?</i>

220
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,980
I mean, you direction
San Francisco?

221
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,940
Direction?

222
00:17:50,364 --> 00:17:53,812
<i>Yeah, why not! Get in man!</i>

223
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:58,000
Yeah! ... Thanks!
Yeah! ... Okay!

224
00:17:58,151 --> 00:17:59,177
<i>I'm Darryl.</i>

225
00:17:59,302 --> 00:18:01,561
<i>Hi Darryl! I'm Veit.</i>

226
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,180
What's he doing there?
No clue!

227
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:49,820
"What's he doing? ... No clue!"

228
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,900
* He uses the apple as a trumpet. *

229
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,300
Zack, zack!

230
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,940
Faster! March, march!

231
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,700
Eyes, straight-ahead!

232
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,180
Yeah, um. Eyes, straight-ahead!

233
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:17,660
Eyes, straight-ahead!

234
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,780
* He laughs. *

235
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,180
Uh.., no, thank you!

236
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,940
No, thank you!
No? ... Oh!

237
00:19:37,661 --> 00:19:39,342
<i>One sec.</i>

238
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,220
What's he doing now?

239
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,540
What's that?

240
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,620
What is that?

241
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,500
Shit!

242
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:11,820
These cartoons are really good.

243
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,060
* Darryl screams. *

244
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,600
* Tom and Veit scream.
Darryl laughs. *

245
00:20:17,672 --> 00:20:21,579
<i>That was urgent.
I almost pissed my pants.</i>

246
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,420
Sorry?

247
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:37,940
Hello!
Oh! Hey!

248
00:20:39,692 --> 00:20:41,034
<i>A question, um...</i>

249
00:20:42,147 --> 00:20:43,719
<i>What... that?</i>

250
00:20:45,331 --> 00:20:49,238
<i>That, oh, that's a TV,
show that I do, a cartoon, I draw it.</i>

251
00:20:51,737 --> 00:20:53,036
<i>Awesome, huh?</i>

252
00:20:53,809 --> 00:20:55,839
<i>We do film too!</i>

253
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,414
<i>You make films?</i>

254
00:21:03,246 --> 00:21:05,581
<i>Wow.
Excommunist filmmaker.</i>

255
00:21:05,701 --> 00:21:07,458
<i>You know what?</i>

256
00:21:07,581 --> 00:21:09,611
<i>There's a bar in my hometown,</i>

257
00:21:09,691 --> 00:21:13,794
<i>where you can show your movie
and make a little money!</i>

258
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:14,440
<i>Really?</i>

259
00:21:14,524 --> 00:21:16,740
<i>Yeah!</i>

260
00:21:16,826 --> 00:21:17,929
<i>Sure.</i>

261
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:18,500
<i>Yeah?</i>

262
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,020
<i>Yeah!</i>

263
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:28,900
You see that? That day you
were really good.

264
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,940
* Darryl screams. *

265
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,114
<i>Funny!</i>

266
00:21:37,733 --> 00:21:40,646
<i>Dude, some respect...
for the art.</i>

267
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,980
Shit! No one's watching.

268
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,900
Boom!

269
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,166
<i>Come on people!</i>

270
00:22:00,251 --> 00:22:01,626
<i>Show a little love!</i>

271
00:22:01,709 --> 00:22:04,928
<i>That is art - that is cinema!</i>

272
00:22:06,312 --> 00:22:08,146
<i>Come on, put your hands together.</i>

273
00:22:13,985 --> 00:22:16,593
<i>Don't worry about these idiots.</i>

274
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:17,893
<i>They have no taste.</i>

275
00:22:17,974 --> 00:22:21,849
<i>But, I do have a little
parting gift.</i>

276
00:22:21,925 --> 00:22:22,919
<i>A little tasty fruit!</i>

277
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,106
<i>- Thank you.
- No, thank you.</i>

278
00:22:25,186 --> 00:22:27,675
<i>Because you've touched my life.</i>

279
00:22:30,288 --> 00:22:33,814
<i>Oh, yes, this is for you.</i>

280
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:37,260
Thanks!
Auf Wiedersehen!

281
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,460
Bye!
Yeah. But ... um!

282
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:41,563
<i>Good luck, man!</i>

283
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,980
Show me!

284
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:48,220
That really is something.

285
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:54,580
(Together:) Hi!
Hi!      Hi!

286
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:56,258
<i>So you're not from here, huh?</i>

287
00:22:56,336 --> 00:22:58,977
<i>No - East Germany.</i>

288
00:23:00,249 --> 00:23:01,591
<i>East Germany?</i>

289
00:23:01,668 --> 00:23:04,888
<i>Yes, we are communists, yes!</i>

290
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:07,073
<i>What's with West Germany?</i>

291
00:23:07,154 --> 00:23:11,258
<i>West Germany? East Germany?
There's a wall?</i>

292
00:23:11,335 --> 00:23:14,206
<i>What wall?</i>

293
00:23:14,289 --> 00:23:19,233
<i>Uh, there's a wall between East
Germany and West Germany.?</i>

294
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:22,686
<i>Huh, Amber.
There are two Germanies.</i>

295
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:27,560
<i>Our daddy tells us that,
communists eat little children.</i>

296
00:23:29,442 --> 00:23:33,883
<i>No, only little girls!</i>

297
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,620
Yeah.

298
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:42,907
<i>You have beautiful eyes!</i>

299
00:23:43,022 --> 00:23:46,929
<i>Your eyes shine like the
stars in the night!</i>

300
00:23:47,011 --> 00:23:50,231
<i>Your eyes shine like the
stars over... Kentucky.</i>

301
00:23:51,538 --> 00:23:54,758
<i>KENTUCKY? Ew, why Kentucky?
Kentucky sucks!</i>

302
00:23:54,837 --> 00:23:58,712
<i>Oh... this is not,
um...Kentucky?</i>

303
00:23:58,789 --> 00:24:00,699
<i>This is Tennessee!</i>

304
00:24:03,545 --> 00:24:05,837
<i>Um, you know what?</i>

305
00:24:05,924 --> 00:24:09,602
<i>Your eyes shine like the
the stars over Tennessee.</i>

306
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:25,404
<i>But, I only do "it" with protection.</i>

307
00:24:25,488 --> 00:24:26,133
<i>What?</i>

308
00:24:26,217 --> 00:24:29,742
<i>I...only...do..."it"...</i>

309
00:24:29,861 --> 00:24:32,579
<i>with...protection.</i>

310
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,112
<i>Protection? Condoms?</i>

311
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:38,600
Ah, "Mondos"! Or something?

312
00:24:38,723 --> 00:24:41,340
- <i>What?</i>
- Yeah, "Mondos"!

313
00:24:41,562 --> 00:24:45,927
<i>No, I'm sorry.
No protection, no sex.</i>

314
00:24:46,012 --> 00:24:48,849
<i>Do you think I wanna get AIDS?!</i>

315
00:24:48,927 --> 00:24:51,067
<i>AIDS?</i>

316
00:24:51,152 --> 00:24:53,182
<i>I am from the GDR!</i>

317
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,025
<i>We have no AIDS!</i>

318
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:58,660
Um...
No.

319
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,820
Okay! Um...

320
00:25:02,507 --> 00:25:08,334
<i>Do you do...um...mouth sex?</i>

321
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:12,100
<i>Ew, gross! Fuck you!</i>

322
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:33,188
- (Whisper:) Veit!
- <i>Sorry.</i>

323
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,060
What's this here?

324
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:39,380
She's showing me her cheers.
Ah! Okay!

325
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,500
Do you have a second?

326
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,900
Please just give me a sec!

327
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,900
What's wrong?

328
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:54,820
Tell me, what do you think of Amber?
What?

329
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,100
Do you like Amber?

330
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:00,740
What? Of course! Of course!
Of course I like Amber!

331
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:04,940
Really? Seriously? She really
really likes you too.   Really?

332
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,780
Yeah! She even likes you
more than me.

333
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:11,860
She wanted me to ask if there
was some way we could switch.

334
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,060
"Switch"?
Yeah, switch.

335
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:17,220
Are you really attached to Dorothee?
Uhh...

336
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,580
Of course! I like Dorothee.

337
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:25,340
But if Amber really wants me,
then ... yeah.

338
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,460
Yeah, she does! She does!

339
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,620
Okay then... Okay!

340
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,740
Hey, Tom!

341
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,820
She won't let you.

342
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,740
I don't understand the question.

343
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,980
Amber won't let you do it.

344
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:47,900
Well yeah! I wasn't going
to say anything. She ...

345
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,660
Shit! Do you have any condoms?

346
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,698
Uh? No, I don't have any.

347
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:57,008
<i>Oh dang! Go!</i>

348
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,968
<i>Put your clothes on! Get out!</i>

349
00:27:01,735 --> 00:27:07,104
<i>Go! Go! Get out!</i>

350
00:27:08,256 --> 00:27:12,010
<i>I thought they weren't
supposed to come back until tomorrow.</i>

351
00:27:12,668 --> 00:27:16,695
<i>Lord, it's good to be home!</i>

352
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,900
Do we jump?
That's what it looks like!

353
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,020
Oh God! Man! Shit!
What?

354
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,300
The backpacks!
Forget them!

355
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:29,500
We need our films.
Do you want to go in there and say:

356
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:34,740
"I fucked your daughter and
now I need my backpack."?

357
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:38,100
Those are our films.
Okay! You're right.

358
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,420
Okay! Go!

359
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,900
* Tom screams. *
Shit, Man!

360
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,060
Tom! Tom!

361
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:53,380
Shit!

362
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,420
Shit!
* Shot *

363
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,580
* Tom screams. *

364
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:25,020
Car! Car!

365
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,780
Hey! Hey!

366
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:58,780
Stupid plan! Fuck hitchhiking!
What am I even doing here?

367
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,820
We've been walking around
for a week now!

368
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:05,180
And now we're still  stuck
somewhere in Tennessee!

369
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:08,740
We're not going to make it
there before your birthday!

370
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:12,220
In New York you said:
"We'll make it work."

371
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:15,260
I saw things much differently
back then.

372
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,380
What? Hey?
Ugh! Really!

373
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,500
Yeah. It's true, man!

374
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:23,060
That is such bullshit!

375
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:28,700
Direction
San Francisco! Man!

376
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,980
Shit!

377
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,340
That is such bullshit!

378
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,500
* A coyote howls. *

379
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,900
* Other animal sounds *

380
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,780
Should I take off my pants?

381
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:53,460
Stop it!
I'm freezing, man!

382
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:58,140
* A stomach growls. *

383
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:00,540
What was that?

384
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:02,940
My stomach.
Well stop it!

385
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:08,060
I can't do anything about it. We
haven't had anything to eat in ages.

386
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,220
* A stomach growls. *

387
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:14,260
You see? Now you made me
do it. Thanks!

388
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,300
Ugh!

389
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,940
* An animal howls. *

390
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,220
Hey! That's a cactus.

391
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,660
Come again?

392
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,380
We can eat it.

393
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:32,740
How do you know that?

394
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,820
Gojko Mitic!

395
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:38,260
"Chingachgook, the great snake".
Right?

396
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,820
Do you want a piece?

397
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,220
No, thanks!

398
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:53,660
Are you already
full or something?

399
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:58,540
It never tastes good
when I cook.

400
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:05,020
To each is own.
That would be so great.

401
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,140
A whole plate.

402
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:11,060
* Men speaking in English. *

403
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:14,020
If I understood that right, -

404
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:17,300
- he said: "You fucking fucker!"

405
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:21,580
"give me my fucking money!"

406
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:25,420
Yeah. And his response was:
"Fuck you!"

407
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,620
That's what he said.
Yeah.

408
00:31:27,811 --> 00:31:29,492
<i>Come on in.</i>

409
00:31:29,576 --> 00:31:30,417
<i>No money!</i>

410
00:31:30,496 --> 00:31:32,178
<i>We have no money!</i>

411
00:31:32,299 --> 00:31:36,970
<i>Don't worry about it. It's alright.
Just get your hungry butts in here!</i>

412
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,580
What?
That we can go in.

413
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,460
I think she likes you.

414
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:47,058
<i>I have for you some coffee.</i>

415
00:31:47,145 --> 00:31:49,405
<i>And for you I made my
fine omlette.</i>

416
00:31:49,485 --> 00:31:51,745
<i>And for you, my best eggs.</i>

417
00:31:51,825 --> 00:31:55,383
<i>Ya'll look like you needed it!</i>

418
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:59,300
Thanks! ... Bon Appetit!
Bon Appetit!

419
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,660
* Tom moans. *

420
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:08,100
Where are we now?

421
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,660
There!
Here?

422
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:17,900
Since we have something before us. What?
Let's go!

423
00:32:26,006 --> 00:32:28,265
<i>I've got some bugs my teeth.</i>

424
00:32:29,381 --> 00:32:31,564
<i>Hey. Your money.</i>

425
00:32:31,645 --> 00:32:34,591
<i>- Shit!
- Marvin, you dipshit!</i>

426
00:32:34,675 --> 00:32:38,932
<i>Smoke more weed, Marvin!</i>

427
00:32:41,005 --> 00:32:42,348
<i>Give him a buck or something.</i>

428
00:32:42,424 --> 00:32:43,189
<i>give him a buck...</i>

429
00:32:44,381 --> 00:32:45,330
<i>Wait.</i>

430
00:32:45,417 --> 00:32:47,829
<i>One second.</i>

431
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:54,423
<i>Where's he going?</i>

432
00:32:55,275 --> 00:32:57,611
<i>Dunno.</i>

433
00:32:57,692 --> 00:32:58,489
<i>Where you from?</i>

434
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,380
GDR. East Germany.

435
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,900
East Germany.
Germany.

436
00:33:07,474 --> 00:33:08,850
<i>You gotta be fucking kidding me.</i>

437
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:17,380
You see! I will be in San
Francisco on my birthday. ... Yeah!

438
00:33:17,487 --> 00:33:19,135
<i>Come on!</i>

439
00:33:20,671 --> 00:33:21,512
<i>Let's go!</i>

440
00:33:21,592 --> 00:33:23,273
<i>Let's go! What are you waiting
on?! Let's go god damn it!</i>

441
00:33:54,966 --> 00:33:58,033
<i>God damn it! What the fuck
are you doing?!</i>

442
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:06,900
My father used to make fires like
this when we went to the Baltic Sea.

443
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:10,620
Really big camp fires.
Yeah? Rügen or Usedom?

444
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:14,460
Hiddensee.
Vitte or what?

445
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:17,020
No. Neuendorf.

446
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:20,020
I was there when I was 6!
I was too, when I was 4 or 5!

447
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:21,900
Eating at the "Heiderose".

448
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:26,100
Yeah, exactly. We went to the
"Heiderose" to eat every night.

449
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:29,460
Yeah, we did too.
I was out on the water every day.

450
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,900
From 7 in the morning
until 6 at night.

451
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:34,820
I would swim like a fish.

452
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:38,260
What "swimming"?
Yeah. I would go swimming.

453
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,660
When you were 4?
Yeah, of course!

454
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,380
My father taught me how.

455
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:47,340
You can't swim when you're 4.
By 10, I was a competitive swimmer.

456
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:51,140
Yeah, but you look more
like a chess player.        Tom!

457
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:55,740
That was 10 years ago.
Why didn't you ever tell me?

458
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:59,580
Because, ever since my father
left, I don't swim anymore.

459
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,620
What is there to tell?

460
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,800
Why did your father leave the GDR?

461
00:35:06,856 --> 00:35:09,923
<i>Hey, guys, scooch it!.</i>

462
00:35:17,098 --> 00:35:18,397
<i>You guys wanna give it a try?</i>

463
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,140
That is shit.

464
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,959
<i>So you're looking for your dad?</i>

465
00:35:26,037 --> 00:35:32,366
<i>My dad was killed during Tet
when I was 10.</i>

466
00:35:32,443 --> 00:35:36,044
<i>My dad, he died in Vietnam.</i>

467
00:35:36,126 --> 00:35:39,956
<i>Shot by some fucking commies.</i>

468
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:43,460
Hey! ... Yeah!
Yeah!

469
00:35:45,217 --> 00:35:48,088
<i>Is that how you commies
killed my dad?</i>

470
00:35:48,171 --> 00:35:49,514
<i>What?</i>

471
00:35:49,591 --> 00:35:54,992
<i>I asked, is that how you
communists killed my dad?</i>

472
00:35:55,076 --> 00:35:56,222
<i>No, we no communists.</i>

473
00:35:56,304 --> 00:35:57,330
<i>But your dad is!</i>

474
00:35:57,416 --> 00:35:58,944
<i>No, my dad is no communist.</i>

475
00:35:59,028 --> 00:36:00,293
<i>What?</i>

476
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:02,051
<i>My dad is no communist!</i>

477
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:07,020
Shit!

478
00:36:11,994 --> 00:36:15,137
<i>They're just kids!</i>

479
00:36:16,827 --> 00:36:18,322
<i>Come on!</i>

480
00:36:19,474 --> 00:36:22,159
<i>He gets crazy when he drinks.</i>

481
00:36:24,576 --> 00:36:26,487
<i>You trying to get
to San Francisco?</i>

482
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,620
Yeah.

483
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:29,942
<i>Come on.</i>

484
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:34,500
Come on!

485
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,540
Shit! Hey!

486
00:36:47,018 --> 00:36:49,931
<i>This is my brother's car.</i>

487
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:53,993
<i>Now, I must return it, but
I don't have time.</i>

488
00:36:54,076 --> 00:36:56,369
<i>You got a map?</i>

489
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,580
The map.

490
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,740
<i>Here San Francisco!</i>

491
00:37:08,807 --> 00:37:10,488
<i>Here, my brother.</i>

492
00:37:10,572 --> 00:37:14,522
<i>Now, it's not San Francisco
but it is California.</i>

493
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:18,158
<i>You bring car to my brother.</i>

494
00:37:20,392 --> 00:37:21,266
<i>Really?</i>

495
00:37:21,352 --> 00:37:22,847
<i>Really.</i>

496
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:25,871
<i>And you trust us?</i>

497
00:37:25,955 --> 00:37:29,022
<i>You try to trick me
and I'll beat the shit out of you</i>

498
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,980
Okay!

499
00:37:33,857 --> 00:37:35,539
<i>Key for the car.</i>

500
00:37:43,793 --> 00:37:45,823
<i>No key for trunk.</i>

501
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:49,740
What? He must be messing
with us.

502
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:53,060
Are we supposed to transport
something illegal?

503
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:57,020
Weapons! Or drugs!
Yeah.

504
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:01,540
Screw it! We'll do it anyway.

505
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:05,020
We'll do it.

506
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:07,100
Okay! We'll do it.
Good.

507
00:38:07,194 --> 00:38:09,180
<i>We bring car to
your brother.</i>

508
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,820
Yeah?

509
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:14,900
We promise.

510
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,340
* Loud screams. *

511
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,700
Yeah!

512
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:37,260
Now that's a pair of glasses.
Looking sharp!

513
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:44,820
Wooohooo!

514
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,300
Yeah, America!

515
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:54,540
That's a powerful picture.

516
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:58,020
One, two, three!

517
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,340
(Both:) San Francisco!

518
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:14,500
Do you want to hear a secret?
Yeah.

519
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:19,260
But don't tell anyone else!
Otherwise it's not a secret anymore.

520
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:24,940
Treat every day like a gift and
the world will give you a gift in return!

521
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:29,420
And today, our gift is this.

522
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,660
Chocolate?
Of course!

523
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:36,700
I filled up for only 13 dollars.
That is unbelievable.

524
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:41,500
Mmmh!

525
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,860
Mmmh!

526
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:48,540
That is the tastiest chocolate,
I have ever eaten.

527
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:57,620
You asked me earlier why
my father had fled East Germany.

528
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:04,180
I think it's because everything
we've experienced here.

529
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:07,940
Yeah. I understand!
That's why. Yeah.

530
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,940
Yeah. I like your dad.

531
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,900
* Veit laughs. *
What do you mean?

532
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:21,060
As a kid, I dreamed of:

533
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:25,980
My father picking me up, and we'd
drive our white Trabants together -

534
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,220
- over the Golden Gate Bridge.

535
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:33,380
There are no Trabants in America.
Still, that was always our car.

536
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:39,820
Oh! The small, white Trabant
would never make it in America.

537
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:52,620
Haha!

538
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:59,380
Thanks!

539
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:10,580
Did you notice that?

540
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,740
No.

541
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,980
Maybe I should shake
things up a bit.

542
00:41:31,009 --> 00:41:32,155
<i>I just... What the...?</i>

543
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:38,100
* Police Sirens *
Shit!

544
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:40,340
Shit! The police!

545
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:44,500
Shit!
Oh! Shit!

546
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:47,500
Tom! The pants! Our pants!

547
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,915
<i>Is the boy naked?</i>

548
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:55,300
Shit! Shit!

549
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:58,420
Shit, man! Your underwear!

550
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:12,180
* The truck honks. *
Tom!

551
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:20,460
Ah!

552
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:26,660
Well at least they look friendly.
Yeah.

553
00:42:26,825 --> 00:42:28,811
<i>Get out of the car!</i>

554
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:44,548
- <i>Friendship!</i>
- <i>Is this some type of a joke?</i>

555
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:52,340
<i>No.</i>

556
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:53,942
<i>Drivers license, sir!</i>

557
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:58,780
(Whispers:) Drivers license.
Ah! Wait, yes.

558
00:43:07,296 --> 00:43:08,562
<i>DDR?</i>

559
00:43:09,368 --> 00:43:11,092
<i>Is this some type of a club?</i>

560
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:14,580
<i>It's East Germany.</i>

561
00:43:15,698 --> 00:43:16,964
<i>You mind opening the trunk
for me sir?</i>

562
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:20,602
<i>Um, no, no key...</i>

563
00:43:20,685 --> 00:43:22,486
<i>Sir, open the trunk!</i>

564
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:26,279
- No keys!
- <i>I don't know what you're
saying, you know what, turn around!</i>

565
00:43:27,398 --> 00:43:29,351
<i>Put your hands on the
roof of the car!</i>

566
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:34,608
- Why? We haven't done anythin wr...
- <i>Hands on the roof. Now!</i>

567
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:37,250
<i>Open the trunk.</i>

568
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:42,740
Man! Say something else!
We're totally fucked.

569
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:49,080
Shit!

570
00:43:49,264 --> 00:43:51,409
- <i>Lydia, check this out.</i>
- <i>What ya got?</i>

571
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:03,912
- Shit!
- <i>What the hell...?</i>

572
00:44:14,122 --> 00:44:16,916
<i>So... we're free?</i>

573
00:44:30,273 --> 00:44:32,074
<i>PUBLIC NUDITY</i>

574
00:44:34,569 --> 00:44:36,709
<i>Get in there. You too.</i>

575
00:44:37,753 --> 00:44:39,664
<i>Make yourself at home, boys.</i>

576
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:50,340
Ah damn it! I shouldn't have
eaten those potatoes.

577
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:54,500
What? The potatoes? Apples!
That was a heroic deed.

578
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:58,860
I'd collapse on the floor.
But it's made of concrete.

579
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:01,940
No.                    Seriously!
I'm going to collapse on the floor.

580
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:04,780
Can you hold on to me for a second?
What?

581
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:08,940
Can you hold on to me? Please!
Yeah. I'm coming.

582
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:11,180
Okay! All good!    Good?
Yeah.

583
00:45:18,838 --> 00:45:20,749
<i>You guys be more careful
next time, alright?</i>

584
00:45:20,833 --> 00:45:22,744
<i>Wear some clothes.</i>

585
00:45:22,828 --> 00:45:23,931
<i>Good luck!</i>

586
00:45:24,017 --> 00:45:25,120
<i>You need it.</i>

587
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:30,571
<i>May the force be with you!</i>

588
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:40,300
600 Dollars.

589
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:46,540
They wanted 600 dollars
for the car repairs.

590
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:52,700
Ahh shit!

591
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:56,100
And now?
I don't know either.

592
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,580
Hey, there's a department store!

593
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:02,420
That's the grand prize.
Madness!

594
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:18,140
What do you have there?
No idea!

595
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:21,580
But it costs 13 dollars.
It tastes really good.

596
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:23,900
And what's that?
Crackers.

597
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:27,180
Are you crazy?
We're stealing groceries.

598
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:31,940
The tastiest foods, and yet
no hard crackers!

599
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:36,020
Yeah. You want to say that a bit louder?
Who's going to understand us?

600
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:41,060
Have you ever met an American that
speaks anything other than American?

601
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:43,620
Here, for example!
... Hello!

602
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:48,700
My friend here loves you
and would like to marry you.

603
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:54,180
Then, he'd like to eat as much
as you, until he's round and juicy.

604
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:57,780
Yeah. See? She laughs. Not a word!
Yeah. So?

605
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:01,420
Here, for example! Come on!
Tom! Hey! It's cool.

606
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:03,780
Hello, girl!

607
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:06,300
You are beautiful.

608
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:11,060
And I would like to sleep with
you right here, right now. Eh?

609
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:14,180
Don't you want to tell me
your name first?

610
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:19,420
Zoey! Hello!
Hello!

611
00:47:20,291 --> 00:47:22,202
<i>It was nice to meet you.</i>

612
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:26,940
I'm sorry. Really!
I wanted to prove something -

613
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:30,420
- to my friend.
Get rid of the stuff! Video!

614
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:33,460
What?
What?

615
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:35,460
Video!

616
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:37,860
Ah, Video! Okay!

617
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:40,100
Excuse me!

618
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:51,100
Hey, boys! You guys hungry?
Come over to my place!

619
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:54,740
It'd make my mother happy.
She's from Germany.

620
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:56,780
My father grills some great streaks.

621
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:59,060
Really? Steaks!
Seriously?

622
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:02,580
Of course! Get in!
Get in!

623
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:06,740
I'm sorry again about earlier.

624
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:08,940
It's okay.

625
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:13,860
What was your name again?
Zoey.

626
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:15,980
Zoey?
Yeah.

627
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,860
There's my house.

628
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:28,300
* Someone knocks. *

629
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:33,860
Hi!
Hi!

630
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:36,380
For you.
Thanks!

631
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:38,660
Good night!
Night! ... Zoey!

632
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:42,660
Ah ... Thanks again!
For everything.

633
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:45,100
Sleep well!

634
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:04,540
Ah! How long has it been since
we slept in a real bed?

635

Hm.
Ah yeah!

636
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:17,100
I was thinking to myself:

637
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:21,900
If 200 people paid 3 dollars
to watch our film:

638
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:24,740
Then we'd have 600 dollars.

639
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:29,340
Well yeah! But 200 people is
a little optimistic for this dump.

640
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:33,460
Maybe Zoey can organize something.

641
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:36,500
Yeah, maybe. Goodnight!
Night!

642
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:48,980

* Tom laughs. * What? Tom!
Look at this, it's a remote control!

644

Not for the tv, but for the bed!

645
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:58,220
Alright, we've all
had a good laugh.

646
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:01,420
You can let me down now.
Okay!

647
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:09,540
You're so funny.
Okay...

648
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:13,900

Ahh!

I thought, if we're going to have
an audience with the mayor, -

734
01:00:02,620 --> 01:00:04,980
- maybe we can give him a gift.
Ahh, okay!

735
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:11,260
And then you thought: I'll give
him a chunk of stone.

736
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:13,900
No, Veit! I thought
to myself:

737
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:17,660
We'll give him a piece

I am your ... chch!
Ah!

796
01:04:31,340 --> 01:04:34,620
I'm going to fight the evil ones.

797
01:04:39,820 --> 01:04:41,820
You'll have to kill me!

798
01:04:42,060 --> 01:04:46,380
I could never kill you.  I'll
always protect you.

799
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:18,220
* Nothing to understand. *

800
01:05:22,020 --> 01:05:24,060
(All:) Mmh!

801
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:27,500
* A locomotive blows its horn. *
Haha!

802
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:32,900
Uuh! ... Oh, no!

803
01:05:33,380 --> 01:05:35,340


804
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:39,460
Ow!
What's wrong? Is it your tooth?

805
01:05:39,620 --> 01:05:41,580
Shit, My tooth!
Hm?

806
01:05:41,820 --> 01:05:45,060
Man! Shit! Fuck Marvin!

807
01:05:46,260 --> 01:05:48,220
What is it?
Tooth loose or something?

808
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:51,940
Can you steer for a second?
Help him!

809
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:35,540
Yeah, and?

810
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:38,860
The tooth is totally messed up.

811
01:06:39,220 --> 01:06:41,980
Well, can he fix it?
For 300 Dollars.

812
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:45,660
And how much do we have left?
60 Dollars.

813
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:48,820
Oh shit!

814
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:53,860
Yeah, shit! You know:
"Money, Money"!

815
01:06:54,020 --> 01:06:57,340
Everything's about money here.
It's like a curse.

816
01:06:57,580 --> 01:07:01,780
Stick a plastic card in the wall
and then you get money.

817
01:07:02,020 --> 01:07:05,020
Without a plastic card, you're
totally screwed here.

818
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:09,540
Okay! Wait! Okay?
What do we do? Ideas?

819
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:12,660
We continue on to
San Francisco.

820
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:16,500
No! I'm not going to
San Francisco like this.

821
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:21,180
My birthday is in 3 days.
Yeah, I didn't forget.

822
01:07:21,460 --> 01:07:26,260
I'm not going with my tooth like this.
So I'm just supposed to be late?

823
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:33,660
Anyone else have a better idea?

824
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:40,900
Anyone have a...
Hey, look at that!

825
01:07:41,180 --> 01:07:45,340
Las Vegas. 1,000 Casinos.
Yeah! Double or nothing.

826
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:47,580
Yeah. Here! "Double or nothing"

827
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:49,700
No! No!

828
01:07:49,742 --> 01:07:51,925
<i>This is our only chance...</i>

829
01:07:52,260 --> 01:07:54,940
We'll bet everything on red.
Yeah!

830
01:07:55,820 --> 01:08:00,380
I take that back, we bet everything
on black. Red is not my color.

831
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:13,500
Red, red, red, red!
Can't you just let it be?

832
01:08:13,740 --> 01:08:17,980
We don't have any more money.
Thanks, Professor! I know.

833
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:22,100
You should have listened to me
earlier and bet on red!

834
01:08:22,380 --> 01:08:26,180
Am I your good luck charm?
You know what... Lay off!

835
01:08:26,420 --> 01:08:29,780
My tooth is killing me.
Boys! Boys! Stop it!

836
01:08:31,710 --> 01:08:33,803
<i>Get your act together!</i>

837
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:35,900
Seriously!

838
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:46,220
What's she doing now?

839
01:08:46,940 --> 01:08:48,940
* Rattling noise *

840
01:08:49,140 --> 01:08:53,700
You let them show you the room,
open the window and say:

841
01:08:53,980 --> 01:08:56,580
"Man it's loud in here."
And leave it open.

842
01:08:56,820 --> 01:08:58,740
Then you can open it.

843
01:08:58,980 --> 01:09:01,980
Yeah. ... Now get your
damned backpack!

844
01:09:02,220 --> 01:09:04,140
Yeah!
Ah! Oh, Man!

845
01:09:14,940 --> 01:09:18,860
For one night! Hnm?
Hey! You're really a firecracker!

846
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:21,060
What? Why's that?

847
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:24,820
You are the cracker.

848
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:54,780
(Quietly:) How's your tooth doing?

849
01:09:56,300 --> 01:09:59,700
It's just pissed that I took -

850
01:09:59,940 --> 01:10:02,540
- such bad care of it for
all these years.

851
01:10:03,460 --> 01:10:09,180
Hm! ... And it wasn't too
happy about the Asprin?

852
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:15,180
It said: "It's a half-hearted
attempt at reconciliation -

853
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:18,220
- But it's too late now
my friend!"

854
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:25,740
Maybe I can cheer up
your tooth a bit.

855
01:10:33,740 --> 01:10:36,820
If you're just trying to
seduce me, forget it.

856
01:10:37,060 --> 01:10:40,860
You may be my tooth's type,
but not mine.

857
01:10:41,140 --> 01:10:44,700
Seduce? That was a
sympathy kiss.

858
01:10:45,180 --> 01:10:47,740
Because you're such a
lousy East German.

859
01:10:54,740 --> 01:10:56,780
Tom!

860
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:06,940
I shouldn't have shown
you that stupid book.

861
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:15,940
Goodnight!
Goodnight!

862
01:12:03,180 --> 01:12:05,300
"The Black Mustang"! Hm, hm!

863
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:26,460
* Noise at the window *

864
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:29,140
Hi!

865
01:12:30,420 --> 01:12:33,420
I know how we can earn
300 Dollars.

866
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:36,820
We strip.
We strip?

867
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:41,700
In a gay bar.  I told the owner
that we were Russians.

868
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:44,460
"No business like show business"

869
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:46,780
Russians?
He found it hot.

870
01:12:47,180 --> 01:12:49,900
I am Igor, You are Andrej.

871
01:12:50,140 --> 01:12:53,580
Together, we are the
"Leningrader Stallions".

872
01:12:55,380 --> 01:12:57,300
I found these at Goodwill.

873
01:12:57,780 --> 01:13:01,500
If he'll take us, it'd be
60 dollars per time.

874
01:13:01,780 --> 01:13:03,980
Five times total,
300 Dollars.

875
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:08,380
Then tomorrow we'll drive to
San Francisco. Uff-uff-ish!

876
01:13:08,740 --> 01:13:10,580
That is your plan?

877
01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:13,460
There's also a pole. Music!

878
01:13:13,940 --> 01:13:17,780
Turn the music on! Pay attention!
* East German National Anthem *

879
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:21,420
* With Choir and Orchestra *
Perfect! Madness!

880
01:13:37,140 --> 01:13:40,140
Tom! Dancing ... okay!

881
01:13:40,540 --> 01:13:43,100
Taking off my clothes?
By all means.

882
01:13:43,580 --> 01:13:48,900
In a strip club? Fine.
In a club for gays? No problem.

883
01:13:49,460 --> 01:13:52,340
But NOT to the national anthem
of East Germany!

884
01:13:58,020 --> 01:14:00,660
(Russian:) Friendship!
Hello!

885
01:14:09,180 --> 01:14:12,820
* Pop music version of the
East German National Anthem *

886
01:15:04,260 --> 01:15:06,460
Let's go!

887
01:16:38,380 --> 01:16:40,260
* Disco Music *

888
01:16:49,340 --> 01:16:51,500
Ho, ho! Come! Good, Veit!

889
01:16:51,740 --> 01:16:53,580
* Nothing to understand. *

890
01:16:53,820 --> 01:16:55,780
Okay!
What?

891
01:16:56,020 --> 01:16:58,340
Hold me a little tight!
Okay.

892
01:16:58,620 --> 01:17:00,500
Is it working?
Okay?

893
01:17:01,780 --> 01:17:03,820
Hey!

894
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:06,980
Haha! You're drunk, Veit!
I know.

895
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:09,460
I think, you're sleepy.
Yeah!

896
01:17:09,620 --> 01:17:12,540
Aren't you going to
come to bed?

897
01:17:12,780 --> 01:17:15,220
But I need to take care
of Tom.

898
01:17:15,460 --> 01:17:19,020
Ugh! He can handle himself.

899
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:23,300
Get out of here.
Maybe you'd come too, -

900
01:17:23,580 --> 01:17:26,580
- if you had watched enough.
Maybe.

901
01:17:26,820 --> 01:17:31,420
Maybe. ... Hah! Good night!
Huh? Good night!

902
01:17:31,540 --> 01:17:35,180
Night! ... Night! Haha!

903
01:17:48,490 --> 01:17:50,902
<i>My friends!</i>

904
01:17:50,983 --> 01:17:51,933
<i>Thank you.</i>

905
01:17:52,058 --> 01:17:53,815
<i>Thank you! You are my friend!</i>

906
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:56,560
Solidarity!
Should I hop on your back?

907
01:17:56,820 --> 01:17:59,140
* Tom neighs like a horse. *

908
01:17:59,420 --> 01:18:01,420
Yeah Hop!

909
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:07,820
Ah! I think I'm all
galloped-out.

910
01:18:10,020 --> 01:18:13,060
I think so. Yeah.
Come on!

911
01:18:41,060 --> 01:18:43,060
If that sign over there -

912
01:18:43,580 --> 01:18:45,540
- blinks yellow -

913
01:18:45,980 --> 01:18:48,140
- at the 10th blink, then you're -

914
01:18:48,540 --> 01:18:52,900
- the horse and I get to be
the rider. Okay?

915
01:18:53,140 --> 01:18:55,180
* Zoey laughs. *

916
01:18:55,380 --> 01:18:57,380
Hm?
No, no!

917
01:18:59,700 --> 01:19:02,700
If the 5th car,
that drives by, -

918
01:19:03,060 --> 01:19:05,020
- is red, -

919
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:09,060
- then you have to kiss me!

920
01:19:10,260 --> 01:19:12,180
One.

921
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:17,060
Two.
Two.

922
01:19:19,620 --> 01:19:22,180
Three.
Hm!

923
01:19:22,540 --> 01:19:24,580
Four.

924
01:20:34,380 --> 01:20:36,500
* Someone laughs. *

925
01:20:36,860 --> 01:20:38,780
* Nothing to understand. *

926
01:20:53,580 --> 01:20:55,500
Shi...Shit!

927
01:20:57,900 --> 01:20:59,980
* Zoey laughs. *

928
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:06,540
Oh, sorry!

929
01:21:06,660 --> 01:21:08,660
Keys!

930
01:21:08,900 --> 01:21:11,180
What?
Give me the car keys!

931
01:21:11,420 --> 01:21:13,940
Why?
Give me the fucking keys!

932
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:18,460
Here!

933
01:21:20,660 --> 01:21:24,340
What's wrong?
Huh? You're such a fucker, Tom!

934
01:21:24,820 --> 01:21:29,340
What's your problem?  Did you not
notice. Or do you just not care?

935
01:21:29,860 --> 01:21:33,300
Come again? What ...
There where enough other women.

936
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:36,940
Come back over here!
You fucking fucker!

937
01:21:37,380 --> 01:21:41,580
Shut the fuck up!
(Both:) Shut you the fuck up!

938
01:21:41,820 --> 01:21:45,180
Veit! I like Zoey. How should
I have known, -

939
01:21:45,660 --> 01:21:48,460
- that you wanted her?
Yeah!    How?

940
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:52,580
You never said anything.
You never opened your mouth.

941
01:21:53,020 --> 01:21:56,300
Yeah! It's always about you!
As long as YOU have fun.

942
01:21:56,740 --> 01:21:59,980
Zoey! Do you not give a shit?
Look out! Okay?

943
01:22:00,340 --> 01:22:02,380
Kiss my ass!
Yeah, fine! Drive!

944
01:22:02,900 --> 01:22:07,180
Drive to your daddy! He's not
waiting for you anyway.

945
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:13,420
He never was.

946
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:35,700
Shit!

947
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:52,300
Ah shit!

948
01:23:41,700 --> 01:23:44,260
You left this in the hotel.

949
01:23:47,340 --> 01:23:49,260
Thanks!

950
01:23:52,780 --> 01:23:56,580
And us? Hm? ... Hm?

951
01:24:02,900 --> 01:24:05,300
If, in the next
2 Minutes -

952
01:24:05,660 --> 01:24:09,420
- a bridge and groom come out
of the church, -

953
01:24:09,780 --> 01:24:11,820
- then we'll see each other again.

954
01:25:13,020 --> 01:25:15,020
Thank you!

955
01:25:20,180 --> 01:25:22,100
Hello! Uh ...

956
01:25:24,609 --> 01:25:26,563
<i>I look for my father.</i>

957
01:25:26,643 --> 01:25:29,436
<i>He sends postcards. Every year.</i>

958
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:32,816
<i>I don't know him.
I'm sorry.</i>

959
01:25:32,895 --> 01:25:37,839
<i>And your coworkers?
The other postmen?</i>

960
01:25:37,921 --> 01:25:38,991
<i>I don't think so.</i>

961
01:25:39,072 --> 01:25:41,527
<i>Hundreds of people come
in here every day.</i>

962
01:25:41,604 --> 01:25:43,480
<i>Sorry.</i>

963
01:25:43,700 --> 01:25:46,560
Okay!
Sorry!

964
01:25:46,700 --> 01:25:49,541
- Thank you.
- <i>Next!</i>

965
01:27:06,020 --> 01:27:10,500
You could have at least told
me which post office it is.

966
01:27:10,860 --> 01:27:15,460
I've been running for 4 hours,
my heels are sore and... Uh ...

967
01:27:32,220 --> 01:27:34,340
Happy Birthday!

968
01:27:48,620 --> 01:27:50,500
That's from Zoey. And also...

969
01:27:55,580 --> 01:28:00,100
I'm really sorry! Really! I'm
really sorry for what I said.

970
01:28:02,780 --> 01:28:05,020
You were such an asshole, ey!

971
01:28:07,060 --> 01:28:08,980
Such an asshole.

972
01:28:22,980 --> 01:28:27,780
Maybe my father won't go in
immediately when he -

973
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:30,940
- comes by here.
First, I'd say hello.

974
01:28:32,260 --> 01:28:34,260
Are you scared?

975
01:28:36,620 --> 01:28:38,700
Yeah.

976
01:28:52,140 --> 01:28:55,980
Tom! Back there you can buy
pizza for one dollar.

977
01:28:56,220 --> 01:28:58,260
Are you hungry?
Yeah. You're not?

978
01:29:00,220 --> 01:29:03,820
Yeah, then it's settled.
Yeah. Cheese or sausage?

979
01:29:04,460 --> 01:29:06,460
Salami!
Salami.

980
01:29:07,020 --> 01:29:09,100
But hurry! Okay?
Yeah!

981
01:29:43,420 --> 01:29:45,460
Excuse me!

982
01:29:45,900 --> 01:29:47,700
Hello! Um!

983
01:29:48,140 --> 01:29:52,300
Excuse me! Mr. Jagoda!
Mr. Jagoda! Mr. Jagoda!

984
01:29:52,700 --> 01:29:57,420
Mr. Jagoda? It's crazy that
you're really here! ... Ach!

985
01:29:59,020 --> 01:30:02,460
Mr. Ja... You are Mr. Jagoda.
Aren't you?

986
01:30:02,940 --> 01:30:05,740
What do you want from me?
Excuse me!

987
01:30:05,980 --> 01:30:08,300
You don't know me.
I am Tom.

988
01:30:08,780 --> 01:30:12,820
I'm here with Veit. We were
waiting over there.

989
01:30:13,340 --> 01:30:17,860
He's getting pizza. Veit is here.
We came all the way from Germany.

990
01:30:19,060 --> 01:30:21,060
Hello! Stay where you are!

991
01:30:21,420 --> 01:30:25,580
Hey, hey! Stay... I mean, after
all these years, -

992
01:30:26,060 --> 01:30:29,460
- can't you at least ...
I am not his father.

993
01:30:30,060 --> 01:30:32,420
Wha... You're not his father?

994
01:30:32,860 --> 01:30:34,940
Here! What is that?

995
01:30:35,420 --> 01:30:39,260
What's that then? I mean it says
right here: "Veit Jagoda".

996
01:30:39,740 --> 01:30:41,740
"Veit Jagoda"!

997
01:30:43,860 --> 01:30:46,620
Come over here! Come here!

998
01:30:49,260 --> 01:30:53,020
Listen to me!
I had been waiting for 4 years -

999
01:30:53,300 --> 01:30:57,500
- for my trip to be approved. Okay?
And then, in July 1979 -

1000
01:30:57,860 --> 01:31:00,540
- 3 men from the Stasi came
to my door.

1001
01:31:01,020 --> 01:31:04,500
One said that, under the right
circumstances, they would -

1002
01:31:04,900 --> 01:31:07,100
- approve my trip.

1003
01:31:07,580 --> 01:31:10,540
To approve my application.
You understand?

1004
01:31:11,180 --> 01:31:15,340
I didn't have to write the
postcards, only send them.

1005
01:31:16,220 --> 01:31:20,060
A couple birthdays a year.
A couple cards at Christmas.

1006
01:31:21,460 --> 01:31:23,380
No, no!

1007
01:31:23,980 --> 01:31:28,380
It became clear to me why I
had to send these cards.

1008
01:31:28,660 --> 01:31:31,780
But not until I was here, in America...
You understand?

1009
01:31:32,020 --> 01:31:36,420
... did I realize that I was
sending them for those who -

1010
01:31:36,540 --> 01:31:38,660
- were killed trying to cross
the Berlin Wall.

1011
01:31:40,660 --> 01:31:45,460
His father is ded. He was shot
trying to escape.

1012
01:31:50,740 --> 01:31:54,340
Please! Yeah? ... I cannot
meet him.

1013
01:31:55,580 --> 01:31:57,540
Please!

1014
01:32:52,900 --> 01:32:56,900
Cheese, sausage! Treat every day
like a gift -

1015
01:32:57,180 --> 01:33:00,580
- and the world will give you
a gift in return.

1016
01:33:01,060 --> 01:33:03,140
Sausage.
Hm!

1017
01:33:05,980 --> 01:33:07,900
What's wrong?

1018
01:33:10,580 --> 01:33:12,420
Hm?

1019
01:33:13,540 --> 01:33:15,620
What's wrong?

1020
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:27,420
I'm sorry, Veit!

1021
01:33:31,300 --> 01:33:33,220
But your ... I mean -

1022
01:33:33,700 --> 01:33:36,980
- your father certainly tried
to do the right thing...

1023
01:33:40,820 --> 01:33:42,700
But ...

1024
01:33:43,180 --> 01:33:45,860
He didn't write the postcards.

1025
01:33:50,340 --> 01:33:53,020
I mean ... Your father isn't
alive.

1026
01:33:55,060 --> 01:33:57,020
He's dead.

1027
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:04,420
What?

1028
01:34:04,900 --> 01:34:09,740
... Postcards ...
simply mailed.

1029
01:34:15,780 --> 01:34:17,780
* Muffled words *

1030
01:34:18,260 --> 01:34:20,260
What the man said...

1031
01:34:22,420 --> 01:34:24,460
... Stasi ... Here!

1032
01:34:24,820 --> 01:34:26,860
... Stasi ...

1033
01:34:29,020 --> 01:34:31,460
Your father was ...

1034
01:34:31,940 --> 01:34:34,820
... shot at the Berlin Wall.

1035
01:34:35,060 --> 01:34:38,100
I'm sorry! ... Wall ...
I'm sorry!

1036
01:34:45,460 --> 01:34:47,500
* Muffled words *

1037
01:34:51,740 --> 01:34:54,460
* Nothing to understand.
No sound. *

1038
01:37:56,113 --> 01:37:58,373
<i>Brother of Hope?</i>

1039
01:37:59,642 --> 01:38:03,014
<i>You the German commies?
You the fucking commies?</i>

1040
01:38:07,085 --> 01:38:09,224
<i>Man, I don't believe it!</i>

1041
01:38:09,310 --> 01:38:10,259
<i>I told my brother he was sick,</i>

1042
01:38:10,345 --> 01:38:12,146
<i>for trusting two German communists!</i>

1043
01:38:12,225 --> 01:38:13,949
<i>The keys.</i>

1044
01:38:17,481 --> 01:38:20,471
<i>You two are the nicest communists
I've ever met.</i>

1045
01:38:20,549 --> 01:38:22,612
<i>Come on in!</i>
